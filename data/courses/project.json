          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:04.315 --> 00:00:09.398\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:09.398 --> 00:00:12.596\nIn this segment we're gonna give you\na general overview of our upcoming\n\n3\n00:00:12.596 --> 00:00:13.820\nProject+ series.\n\n4\n00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.360\nNow, Ronnie, there're a lot of people\nout there that are interested in project\n\n5\n00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.730\nmanagement, CompTIA has come to\ntheir rescue with a certification,\n\n6\n00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.390\nand we're gonna do a series on that.\n\n7\n00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.740\nAnd I guess a good place to start with\nthis overview is, what type of person, or\n\n8\n00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.600\nwho is the intended audience for\nour upcoming episodes?\n\n9\n00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.990\n>> Whenever we start taking\na look at the CompTIA Project+,\n\n10\n00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.310\nwhat we're trying to do is make sure\nthat you have the proper amount of\n\n11\n00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.020\nknowledge that you have to be able to\nmake sure you face the Project+ exam.\n\n12\n00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.900\nBut also that you have knowledge, and\n\n13\n00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.890\nyou have skills, to make sure that you\ncan go into project management as well.\n\n14\n00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.690\nA lot of times what you're looking for\nat this point, if you're a candidate for\n\n15\n00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.690\nthe Project+, is that you have about\n12 months of experience in working with\n\n16\n00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.070\nprojects of small to medium size or\n\n17\n00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.450\nyou've been a project team member\non a larger type of project.\n\n18\n00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.080\nBut yet now you're actually\nseeking more certification so\n\n19\n00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.390\nthat you can become a project\nleader in project management.\n\n20\n00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.730\nSo that's usually who the general\naudience is going to be for.\n\n21\n00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.440\nAnybody who has also ended up working with\nsome of the project management types of\n\n22\n00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.156\ntools out there.\n\n23\n00:01:10.156 --> 00:01:14.620\nLike, Microsoft project, Primavera,\nthese actually help you to actually\n\n24\n00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.752\nunderstand the skills that we'll be\ncovering during our Project+ exam as well.\n\n25\n00:01:17.752 --> 00:01:22.470\n>> Now Ronnie, now that we know who is the\nintended audience, what is a good general\n\n26\n00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.120\noverview, just the basic outline of what\nwe're gonna cover inside of this series?\n\n27\n00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.870\n>> When we start taking a look at what\nwe're gonna be covering in the Project+\n\n28\n00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.120\nseries, we're gonna take the actual\nCompTIA official exam objectives and\n\n29\n00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.560\nmake sure that we go over each and\n\n30\n00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.740\nevery one of those exam objectives to make\nsure that you are prepared for the exam.\n\n31\n00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.510\nWhat you'll see is that the exact itself\nis divided into five different categories\n\n32\n00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.680\nor domain objective for us, and\nif we take a look at my computer,\n\n33\n00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.920\nwe will go ahead and\ntake a look at them right here.\n\n34\n00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.750\nIs that it is broken down in this way,\nwe have the pre-project set up,\n\n35\n00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.880\nwe have the project planning,\nthe project execution, change control and\n\n36\n00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.900\ncommunication and of course,\nthe project closure itself.\n\n37\n00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.000\nAnd if this is sounding familiar to\nyou because you have been in project\n\n38\n00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.010\nmanagement for some point in time, well,\n\n39\n00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.470\nyou'll notice these as being the five\ndifferent phases of project management.\n\n40\n00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.100\nAnd they've gone ahead and they've\nactually weighted them a little bit\n\n41\n00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.390\ndifferently, where you can actually see\nit actually adds to up to 100% here.\n\n42\n00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.920\n12% of the exam will be on the initiation,\na whole 30% will be during the planning,\n\n43\n00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.090\nanother 23% in the execution and\ndelivery, of course.\n\n44\n00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.730\nAnd then another 27% here on change\ncontrol and communication, and\n\n45\n00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.500\nfinally the project closeout\nitself is another 9% as well.\n\n46\n00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.700\nAnd this gives us that overall total of\nabout 100 questions that we'll be facing,\n\n47\n00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.010\nand we'll get about 90 minutes here\nto actually do the entire exam.\n\n48\n00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.470\nSo it's timed, and you do have time\nto actually answer questions but\n\n49\n00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.358\nyou can't dawdle around if\nyou're gonna be doing this exam.\n\n50\n00:02:49.358 --> 00:02:52.100\nSo you wanna make sure that you\nactually do get prepared for it.\n\n51\n00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.670\nSo watch the series\nthat we're about to do.\n\n52\n00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.900\nMake sure you do understand, and make sure\nyou actually do practice some of these\n\n53\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.870\ndifferent scenarios that\nwe'll be taking a look at.\n\n54\n00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.270\n>> Now Ronnie, I want you to wet our\nappetite a little bit with maybe\n\n55\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.980\nthe details,\n\n56\n00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.900\nthe specifics of what we might encounter\nin our series covering those five domains.\n\n57\n00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.760\n>> Whenever we start taking a look here,\n\n58\n00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.920\nthe exam objectives will\npretty much be our guides.\n\n59\n00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.490\nSo what I recommend to you is\nthat you go out CompTIA and\n\n60\n00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.500\nthat you download their exam objectives.\n\n61\n00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.210\nAnd they'll be the exact copy\nof what I'm showing you here.\n\n62\n00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.450\nAnd we'll take a look here at just some\nof the brief things that we'll dive into.\n\n63\n00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.660\nWe initiate here,\nin other words the pre-project setup.\n\n64\n00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.910\nWe will take a look at each one of this\nobjectives here talking about what it\n\n65\n00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.325\ntakes to get a project\nstarted in the initiation.\n\n66\n00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:36.070\nWhere we haven't done anything yet but\n\n67\n00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.910\nwe just need to get to the point where\nwe can get a project charter up and\n\n68\n00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.920\nrunning, and how do we get to that point\nand what does it end up looking like.\n\n69\n00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.620\nWe'll also, of course,\noutline the project life cycles and\n\n70\n00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.470\nwe'll actually end up taking a look\nat some of the different structures\n\n71\n00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.420\nthat we end up working in inside of\na project team for different companies.\n\n72\n00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.260\nWe'll talk about about\nthe different matrices as well.\n\n73\n00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.050\nIn the project planning phase here,\n\n74\n00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.995\nthis will take the most time that we'll\nspend in our entire episode here.\n\n75\n00:04:03.995 --> 00:04:07.270\nWhere we start taking a look at some of\nthe documents that we have to have on\n\n76\n00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.640\nhand, and we break down the terminology\nthat you'll need to learn for\n\n77\n00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.430\nthe CompTIA exam as well and we'll also\nuse the industry wide terminology as well,\n\n78\n00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.110\nto make sure that you actually do take\nsome time here to learn that too.\n\n79\n00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:24.100\nYou'll see that we'll talk about approval\nprocesses as well as the way to do\n\n80\n00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.620\nsome analysis on our project as well,\nby learning about the PERT,\n\n81\n00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.740\nhere, and the Gantt chart, and\nusing the critical path method,\n\n82\n00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.100\nwe'll see several examples of that, we'll\ntake a look at networking diagramming.\n\n83\n00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.340\nYou'll also end up seeing the ideal,\nof course,\n\n84\n00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.630\nof making sure that we have\ncommunication plans that we have set up,\n\n85\n00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.325\nas well as resource and\nquality management.\n\n86\n00:04:45.325 --> 00:04:49.970\nWe'll take a brief view at\nthe idea of cost management,\n\n87\n00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.335\nin other words budgeting,\njust a little bit.\n\n88\n00:04:52.335 --> 00:04:54.800\nWe'll talk about procurement and\nhow we ensure that we get that, and\n\n89\n00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.775\nthen of course transition phases.\n\n90\n00:04:56.775 --> 00:04:59.060\nWe'll also end up seeing that\nduring the execution and\n\n91\n00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.000\ndelivery we'll deal with the idea of human\nresources as well as resources themselves.\n\n92\n00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.210\nTalk about the idea of how we\nbegin great on a project which is,\n\n93\n00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.950\nof course, a project kick off meeting and\nhow to organize one of those.\n\n94\n00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.315\nWe'll also take a look of course\nat the role that organization\n\n95\n00:05:14.315 --> 00:05:19.570\ngovernment has on our project execution.\n\n96\n00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.210\nWe'll also end up taking a look at how\n\n97\n00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.810\nwe use the different components that we'll\nend up finding out on our project here\n\n98\n00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.220\nto help us to make sure that we manage\nour projects a little bit better.\n\n99\n00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.050\nAnd then of course we'll take a look\nat the change and communication and\n\n100\n00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.510\nthe control here.\n\n101\n00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.260\nThe very fact is, we'll see that\nexecution as well as the monitoring and\n\n102\n00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.910\ncontrolling phase of most projects\nessentially go hand in hand.\n\n103\n00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.980\nThey don't really follow sequentially, and\nso we'll also see proper change management\n\n104\n00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.810\nprocedures and that will be kind of\nthe majority of what we'll see there,\n\n105\n00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.020\nis how do we manage changes that come\non to our project and then, of course,\n\n106\n00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.240\ncommunication processes as well.\n\n107\n00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.760\nWe'll also take a look at all of these\nearned value types of measurements and\n\n108\n00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.390\nresults, and we'll go over each and\nevery one of these so\n\n109\n00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.020\nthat we ensure that we have examples\nas well as how to actually get\n\n110\n00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.680\nthe value out of them that we need to so\nthat we can get our project back on track.\n\n111\n00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.400\nAnd lastly,\n\n112\n00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.840\nwe'll talk about the importance of\nthe formal closing of our project as well.\n\n113\n00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.670\nWe'll go through the different project\nstages as far as the close goes.\n\n114\n00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.310\nAnd what we should end up with in the end\nhere of the documentation that we need\n\n115\n00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.150\nto show that we've done everything that\nwe can do to officially close out of\n\n116\n00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.140\nour project.\n\n117\n00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.330\nSo there's a lot of details that\nwe'll be going over in our series.\n\n118\n00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.420\nAnd you'll see that we\nactually have taken the time,\n\n119\n00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.650\nif you download the exam objectives, that\nwe will have covered every single one of\n\n120\n00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.830\nthese exam objectives when\nwe are done with our series.\n\n121\n00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.550\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n122\n00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.920\nNow Ronnie,\nthat brings us to the actual exam itself.\n\n123\n00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.880\nHow does one go about actually\ngetting signed up for the exam and\n\n124\n00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:48.680\nhow much is it going to cost.\n\n125\n00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.970\nGive me some of the details or\n\n126\n00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.480\ngive our viewers should I say some of\nthe details so they know what to expect.\n\n127\n00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.650\n>> Normally you take the exam by going\nto a third party testing provider,\n\n128\n00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.300\nsuch as Pearson Vue.\n\n129\n00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.610\nNow you can actually go online, actually\ngo ahead and register for the exam there.\n\n130\n00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.500\nMake sure that as you do so,\nyou go ahead and you know a couple things.\n\n131\n00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.830\nOne, you need to make sure that you\nactually know what the exam number is.\n\n132\n00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.650\nAnd apparently I already clicked on that.\n\n133\n00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.300\nLet me show you what the exam number is,\nso I can scroll back up here.\n\n134\n00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.310\nSo you wanna make sure that you have\nthis exam number right here, PK0-003.\n\n135\n00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.990\nAnd then, when you go and\nregister at Pearson Vue, it will\n\n136\n00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:29.070\nkick you out to CompTIA's website that\nwill allow you to buy the exam voucher.\n\n137\n00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:33.530\nNow, the exam voucher is\nself cost about $285.\n\n138\n00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.370\nSo, it's fairly expensive\nin US dollars here.\n\n139\n00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.370\nSo, when you do take the exam,\nmake sure you do understand that,\n\n140\n00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.831\nthat there is the cost for it.\n\n141\n00:07:40.831 --> 00:07:43.950\nIt will register and\nyou will also need to pick an exam date,\n\n142\n00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:48.150\nverify the nearest testing center near you\nthat you can take it from Pearson Vue.\n\n143\n00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.850\nAnd you'll need to make sure that you\narrive there about 15 minutes early with\n\n144\n00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.690\na picture ID so they can verify that\nyou are who you say that you are.\n\n145\n00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:58.660\nYou will be able to enter the testing\nbooth at that particular point in time and\n\n146\n00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:03.500\nyou'll sit down to a 100 question test and\nyou'll be given about 90 minutes to do so.\n\n147\n00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.500\nSo make sure you do pay attention as\nyou go on through, that exam procedure.\n\n148\n00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.230\nBecause any violation\nof any other processes\n\n149\n00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.550\nwill not allow you to take the exam again.\n\n150\n00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.380\nSo do pay attention there.\n\n151\n00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.532\nSo remember here's the details, $285,\n\n152\n00:08:18.532 --> 00:08:22.670\nit's a 100 question exam and you'll\nhave about 90 minutes to complete it.\n\n153\n00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.340\nBut in our series, we'll make sure that\nwe cover every single exam objective.\n\n154\n00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.810\nSo that you can ensure that the knowledge\nthat you'll gain from our show\n\n155\n00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.710\nwill really help you to get ready for\nthe exam itself.\n\n156\n00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.600\nNow that doesn't mean that\njust by watching a show,\n\n157\n00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.100\nthat you'll be able to pass the exam.\n\n158\n00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.520\nBut it means you need to study.\n\n159\n00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.020\nIt means you'll the prerequisite\nknowledge to do so.\n\n160\n00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.900\nBut it also means you\nhave to learn it too.\n\n161\n00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.800\nSo, don't just sit back and go hey,\nI don't have to worry about it,\n\n162\n00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.020\nI'm watching the show,\nit's gonna happen by osmosis.\n\n163\n00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.070\nYou need to pay attention, take notes,\n\n164\n00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.740\nmake sure you do ask\nquestions if you need to.\n\n165\n00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.270\nAnd we have a forum to help you out,\nso make sure you check that out too.\n\n166\n00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:55.920\n>> All right, Ronnie.\n\n167\n00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.790\nWell, thank you so much for\n\n168\n00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:01.130\ntaking the time out of your busy schedule\nto give us that really well concise and\n\n169\n00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:04.300\nquick overview about our\nupcoming Project+ series.\n\n170\n00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.170\nIf that sounds like something\nthat you might be interested in,\n\n171\n00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.700\nthen we'll look forward to seeing\nyou on those upcoming episodes.\n\n172\n00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.100\nUntil then, we'll see you next time.\n\n173\n00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:18.400\n[SOUND]\n\n",

another episode of ITProTv.\n\n4\n00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.870\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.780\nAnd in today's episode we're starting\non our train of Project+ from CompTIA.\n\n6\n00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.685\nHopefully you guys are here for that.\n\n7\n00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:25.500\n[LAUGH].\n\n8\n00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.540\nJoining us in the studio today\nis our friend and mentor,\n\n9\n00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.660\nwhen it comes to Project,\nthat is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.890\nRonnie, welcome to the show, sir.\n\n11\n00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.580\n>> Well, thank you for\ninviting me back as we come back and\n\n12\n00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.590\ntake a look at Project Plus,\n\n13\n00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.090\nCompTIA's special offering here to get\nus certified in project management.\n\n14\n00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.650\nSo when it comes down to the basic\nquestion, you may be asking yourself,\n\n15\n00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.230\nwhy in the world do I actually need\na certification in project management?\n\n16\n00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.130\nWhat in the world is going on here and\nwhy do I need to learn those concepts?\n\n17\n00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.230\nWell, the reason why we need to is,\na lot of times,\n\n18\n00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.270\nwhat you're starting to see is that there\nis a movement inside of most businesses\n\n19\n00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.930\nto move from the traditional\nideas of just departments.\n\n20\n00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.620\nActually moving toward projetised,\nI know that's kind of a fancy work, right?\n\n21\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.480\nProjetised teams.\n\n22\n00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.090\nAnd the way that they work and\nthat they do things,\n\n23\n00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.530\nbecause they're starting to\nfind out more and more of that.\n\n24\n00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.510\nMost teams,\n\n25\n00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.110\nmost departments out there, they're\nnot really working just day to day,\n\n26\n00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.220\nthey're really focused in on particular\nthings that they need to accomplish and\n\n27\n00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.260\nthen, once they're done with that,\nthey have to focus in on something else.\n\n28\n00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.440\nAnd so it's better for\n\n29\n00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.510\nan organization a lot of time\nit's actually in this transition.\n\n30\n00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.420\nTo say look, we need to make\nsure that everybody has a better\n\n31\n00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.640\nunderstanding of how these\nprojects end up working.\n\n32\n00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.460\nAnd, we wanna make sure that you\nunderstand those concepts as well.\n\n33\n00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.450\nAnd so that's where we're really beginning\nis with this idea, of realizing that,\n\n34\n00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.400\nyeah, the nature of businesses\nare actually changing a lot of times.\n\n35\n00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.410\nAnd even though you still have people that\nwill still stay in the same functional\n\n36\n00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.860\nideas that they were before.\n\n37\n00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.270\nYou know, people working within\ndepartments and then those departments\n\n38\n00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.300\nreporting to their head of the department,\nand then the head of department reporting\n\n39\n00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.650\nto the chief operating officer or\nwhoever it actually is.\n\n40\n00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.840\nWell those things still end up happening,\nbut\n\n41\n00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.670\nnow you're starting to see from\nthe bottom, from the bottom?\n\n42\n00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.600\nFrom the top coming down, as you're\nstarting to say hey, can your team.\n\n43\n00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.030\nDo this for me.\n\n44\n00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.920\nAnd what is that functional\nmanager gonna say?\n\n45\n00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.660\nWell no, here's my particular specialty\nand area, and no we can't do that.\n\n46\n00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.950\nMaybe you better hand\nthat off to another team.\n\n47\n00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.190\nOr you might actually see\nwhat project managers and\n\n48\n00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.510\nwhat department heads normally say,\nis of course we can handle that.\n\n49\n00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.970\nAnd so when stuff like that comes down,\n\n50\n00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.100\nyou have to actually learn how to adjust\nand do things and be able to do that.\n\n51\n00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.900\nAnd so today,\nthat's what we're really focusing in on.\n\n52\n00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.860\nIs this idea of some of the project\nmanagement steps that we\n\n53\n00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.360\nhave to actually understand and\nlearn how to do.\n\n54\n00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.070\nAnd if you are really interested\nin becoming a project manager,\n\n55\n00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.260\nthis is actually the right place for\nus to begin today.\n\n56\n00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.430\nSo the big question right at\nthe beginning here, right?\n\n57\n00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.470\nIs, why project management?\n\n58\n00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.080\nWhy is it something that I need to do?\n\n59\n00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.900\nWell let me go ahead and\n\n60\n00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.530\nbring up three possible scenarios\nhere that we want to take a look at.\n\n61\n00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.040\nAnd I don't have anything real fancy,\nbut let me move this over so\n\n62\n00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.430\nthat we can see them all\nright here on the screen.\n\n63\n00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.680\nSo what I have listed here,\n\n64\n00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.080\nDaniel, on the screen, is three\ndifferent things that can happen, right?\n\n65\n00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.460\nTake for an example,\nbuilding an amusement park, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.620\nThe second one here is migrating\nusers over to Office 365,\n\n67\n00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.340\nand my third one is building a bridge.\n\n68\n00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.350\nNow, if I look at all three of those,\n\n69\n00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.650\nDaniel, can you actually see a common\nthread through all three of those?\n\n70\n00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.825\nI try to make it so you couldn't.\n\n71\n00:03:30.825 --> 00:03:32.517\nLAUGH] That's what I'm trying to do.\n\n72\n00:03:32.517 --> 00:03:36.350\n>> [LAUGH] No, they are pretty well, I\nmean they are completely different things.\n\n73\n00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.630\nI've actually done two of them.\n\n74\n00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.165\n>> Okay, yeah.\n\n75\n00:03:38.165 --> 00:03:39.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Which is interesting.\n\n76\n00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.810\nI'll leave it up to you to figure\nout which one of those are, but no.\n\n77\n00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.680\nI can't see any correlation\nbetween any of those three things.\n\n78\n00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.560\n>> Yeah, that's kind of the hard\nthing to be able to do, right?\n\n79\n00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.690\nSo imagine that here it is, you\nare actually someone that says hey look,\n\n80\n00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.370\nthere's three different\nthings that I can work on.\n\n81\n00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.850\nBut not all of us have experience,\n\n82\n00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.015\neven with Daniel who did two out of\nthe three here, most of us might have done\n\n83\n00:04:03.015 --> 00:04:07.750\none, but not two out of three,\nbetter yet, all three out of three here.\n\n84\n00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.580\nBut what project management allows us to\ndo, is to be able to take skills that we\n\n85\n00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.180\nlearn from one particular concept\nsuch as building an amusement park.\n\n86\n00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.720\nAnd being able to use those\nskills to manage the same thing,\n\n87\n00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.130\nsuch as migrating users\nover to Office 365,\n\n88\n00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.540\nas well as some of the things that help\nus to manage the building of the bridge.\n\n89\n00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.430\nNow notice what I'm not saying.\n\n90\n00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.120\nI'm not saying that technically,\n\n91\n00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.100\nif you know how to migrate users from\nOffice 265, that you could take those and\n\n92\n00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.540\nactually begin to pour\nthe foundation of building a bridge.\n\n93\n00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.680\nI'm not saying that you can actually\ndrive everything in that you need to.\n\n94\n00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.660\nBut, what I'm saying is\nthe management concepts, though, and\n\n95\n00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.020\nbeing able to complete the tasks\nthat are ahead of you,\n\n96\n00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.020\nthey are actually things that can\nbe interchangeable in that way.\n\n97\n00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.990\nAnd project management allows us to be\nable to take skills and knowledge that we\n\n98\n00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.140\nhave, to be able to see that there can be\nsome commonality between these things.\n\n99\n00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.950\nAt the very beginning here,\n\n100\n00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.260\neach of these things are not\nessentially an ongoing process.\n\n101\n00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.850\nOkay?\n\n102\n00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.250\nNow what do I mean by that?\n\n103\n00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.460\nPeople do go to amusement parks every day.\n\n104\n00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.280\nHopefully you may actually be going to one\ntoday, and that would be actually fun.\n\n105\n00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.230\nBut the building of it happened\nin some point in the past, and\n\n106\n00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.830\nwhen that was done, the people that worked\non building that, they didn't just say,\n\n107\n00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.330\nwell my life's work is done,\nI don't have to build another one again.\n\n108\n00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.780\nThey essentially went on and actually\nmaybe gone on to make another amusement\n\n109\n00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.910\npark somewhere, or\neven gone on to different projects.\n\n110\n00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.130\nSame thing happens here.\n\n111\n00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.570\nWhat if we actually get all of our users\ninside of my organization to move from\n\n112\n00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:46.030\nthe traditional, where we put a lot of\nsoftware on individual computers and\n\n113\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.140\nthat everything that we do is\nin house on site of where I am.\n\n114\n00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.720\nAnd actually moved all of my users over to\nOffice 365 which is a complete cloud based\n\n115\n00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.020\noperation there, and allowed them to\nbe able to actually understand and\n\n116\n00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.680\nknow how to actually do everything.\n\n117\n00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.610\nWell, once I was done with that, it didn't\nmean that my job was completely done.\n\n118\n00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.400\nIt just meant that I needed to move\non to a different project as well,\n\n119\n00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.940\nsame thing with building a bridge.\n\n120\n00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.890\nEverybody uses bridges.\n\n121\n00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.841\nAnd, a lot of times, you may actually be\nusing a bridge everyday to get back and\n\n122\n00:06:12.841 --> 00:06:14.200\nforth from work.\n\n123\n00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.200\nAnd it doesn't mean that the building\nof the bridge continues on today.\n\n124\n00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.290\nIt means that it was done, but\nnow you actually get a useful function out\n\n125\n00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.660\nof when everything is actually done and\nover with.\n\n126\n00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.310\nAnd the skill set that actually\nlies through all of those, and\n\n127\n00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.620\nto continue them all the way through that\nis a skill set of project management.\n\n128\n00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.050\nSomewhere at some point in time, somebody\nknew, okay, that this would have to\n\n129\n00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.280\nactually be started, and would actually\nhave to be accomplished and finished, so\n\n130\n00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.720\nthat someone could end up with a product\nthat they could use at the very end\n\n131\n00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.860\nof their life cycle and, you know,\nwhen everything was done here.\n\n132\n00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.250\nAnd so a lot of times project\nmanagement is that string.\n\n133\n00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.410\nI'm not talking about how to\ndo every technical thing.\n\n134\n00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.890\nI'm saying how do you manage those things?\n\n135\n00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.510\nHow do you make sure that\nthis stuff gets done?\n\n136\n00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.470\nAnd that is what we're focusing\nin on project management.\n\n137\n00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.370\nSo it's difficult if\nyou're someone like me.\n\n138\n00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.330\nYou start off in figuring out how to\ndo the thing you're assigned to do.\n\n139\n00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.710\nAnd then you do that, and then when\nit comes down to the management side,\n\n140\n00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.420\nwe might not be very good at it.\n\n141\n00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.000\nThe very fact is, we're used to what?\n\n142\n00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.460\nWe're used to getting in the trenches and\ngetting it done.\n\n143\n00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.380\nAnd I remember the first time that I was\nteaching project management concepts\n\n144\n00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.360\nto a group of people that were actually\nworking out of a phosphate plant.\n\n145\n00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.180\nAnd these were people that\nhad been in the trenches.\n\n146\n00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.520\nThey were the ones that\nactually dug the lines.\n\n147\n00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.900\nThey were the ones that were actually\ngoing into the mines and doing stuff.\n\n148\n00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.810\nAnd they were promoted to\nthese project managers, and\n\n149\n00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:42.810\nnow that meant that they had to take hands\noff, and go, you don't have to do it.\n\n150\n00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:44.420\nYou have to actually be\nwilling to manage and\n\n151\n00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.820\nensure that all of those work packages,\neverything's actually there, is there.\n\n152\n00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.518\nSo that the job can get done.\n\n153\n00:07:50.518 --> 00:07:54.549\nIt's very difficult to transition\nthought it if there is no process,\n\n154\n00:07:54.549 --> 00:07:58.458\nif there is no knowledge behind\nhow that project management works.\n\n155\n00:07:58.458 --> 00:08:00.798\nAnd I remember saying this to somebody,\nright.\n\n156\n00:08:00.798 --> 00:08:04.244\nThis guy was saying, they call me this\nweekend and I just had to get out there\n\n157\n00:08:04.244 --> 00:08:07.380\nand I have to spend 12 hours on\nthe line getting this thing back on.\n\n158\n00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.950\nAnd I said, did you do the work?\n\n159\n00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.010\nHe said, I did the majority of it.\n\n160\n00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.890\nThat's were we make mistakes\nas project managers, we're\n\n161\n00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.996\nsupposed to be able to take a look at that\nsituation and say, who's best for the job?\n\n162\n00:08:17.996 --> 00:08:19.230\nHe says, I was.\n\n163\n00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.080\nThe problem is you're now a manager\nwhich means you need to be able to use\n\n164\n00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.560\nyour resources efficiently.\n\n165\n00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.750\nIf you're the only one that can do it,\nthat's fine.\n\n166\n00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.650\nBut a lot of times, there's other\nthings that have to be in place so\n\n167\n00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:33.445\nthat all the other steps in that\nprocess can fall in line and\n\n168\n00:08:33.445 --> 00:08:35.065\nget completed when they need too.\n\n169\n00:08:35.065 --> 00:08:36.895\n>> Yeah Ronny you actually\nbring up a good point there.\n\n170\n00:08:36.895 --> 00:08:40.845\nAnd this is something that I have\nnoticed throughout my career as well.\n\n171\n00:08:40.845 --> 00:08:45.027\nLet's say you have a COG makers and\nthat's your business.\n\n172\n00:08:45.027 --> 00:08:47.897\nAnd the managers look down and\nthey see Johnny over here.\n\n173\n00:08:47.897 --> 00:08:49.677\nAnd Johnny is the number one cogniator.\n\n174\n00:08:49.677 --> 00:08:51.337\nThe guy is phenomenal at it,\n\n175\n00:08:51.337 --> 00:08:54.967\nhe does the best job,\nhe's at work early, he leaves late.\n\n176\n00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:58.557\nHis cogs are always come out and\nthey never have to be returned or redone.\n\n177\n00:08:58.557 --> 00:08:59.287\nThey think, you know what?\n\n178\n00:08:59.287 --> 00:09:01.010\nLet's promote him to a manager.\n\n179\n00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.040\nWell here's what they've done.\n\n180\n00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.010\nThey've taken their best cog maker and\n\n181\n00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.300\nnow taken him out of\nthe system of making cogs.\n\n182\n00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.470\nThey took him from what he does best and\n\n183\n00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.750\nput him into something that he\nmight not be good at at all.\n\n184\n00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.060\nAnd that's kind of the purpose of people\nthat get into project management.\n\n185\n00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.660\nThey say well, I'm a good manager.\n\n186\n00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.920\nAnd that's what you want as a manager.\n\n187\n00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.800\nThat goes back to Ronnie's\nillustration there.\n\n188\n00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.470\nThat guy was great at working on\nthat line and that's why he knew\n\n189\n00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:28.180\nI was the best guy to get down and make\nthat done, but he's no longer that job.\n\n190\n00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.550\nHe needs to leave that in the hand of\nthe people that he's asked to do that.\n\n191\n00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:32.270\nIf they can't do that,\n\n192\n00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.240\nhe needs to find somebody who\ncan because he's now a manager.\n\n193\n00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.830\nNow that goes back to my point, he might\nnot have been the best manager, he was\n\n194\n00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.050\nthe best guy on the line, they should\nhave left him there, gave him more money,\n\n195\n00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.160\ngave him stock options,\nsomething like that to keep him happy.\n\n196\n00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.900\nOn the line, and hired someone that was\nproject management, that knew project\n\n197\n00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.100\nmanagement, maybe has a Project Plus\ncertification under their belt already,\n\n198\n00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.840\nand then would've made a whole\nlot smoother transition.\n\n199\n00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.360\n>> And Daniel, you make a great point.\n\n200\n00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.530\nNot everybody can actually\nbe a great project manager.\n\n201\n00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.840\nBut the good thing that you and\nI can do, even if you go,\n\n202\n00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.030\nno I don't really have any aspirations for\nit.\n\n203\n00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.910\nBut being Project Management certified\nwill at least help me understand some of\n\n204\n00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.930\nthe things that go into every single\nproject that I might be a part of.\n\n205\n00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.200\nSo I understand those basic processes and\ncan help get things done.\n\n206\n00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:21.610\nA lot of times what ends up happening is\neven in that organization that actually\n\n207\n00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:26.150\nfunctions in the way that we talked about,\nas a functional type of machinery or\n\n208\n00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:30.090\noperation, where you are one\nparticular person and\n\n209\n00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.230\nyou report up to another supervisor.\n\n210\n00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:37.140\nThat supervisor ends up reporting to\nanother supervisor can work and does work.\n\n211\n00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.570\nBut when it comes down to project and\ntimes are getting pushed into those.\n\n212\n00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.600\nThe world is changing that way.\n\n213\n00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.790\nIt doesn't mean that you just get to say,\nhey,\n\n214\n00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.840\nI'm gonna bury my head in the sand and\nonly do what I'm good at doing.\n\n215\n00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.760\nA lot of times, you're actually\nunder a time crunch pressure.\n\n216\n00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.860\nYou're under delivering\nwhat that component is.\n\n217\n00:10:54.860 --> 00:11:01.570\nAnd it just has to be done and has to be\ndone in a timely manner and understanding,\n\n218\n00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.700\nthat once everything is done,\nyou might move on to a different project.\n\n219\n00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.580\nProject management skills\nare gonna help serve you\n\n220\n00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.310\nin anything that you actually\nchoose to do at this point.\n\n221\n00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.900\nBut if you are ready,\nsomeone that's saying,\n\n222\n00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.490\nI'm looking into project management.\n\n223\n00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.160\nThis is where you want to at least begin,\nis right here.\n\n224\n00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:21.390\nJust kind of giving a basic introduction\nto why we want something like\n\n225\n00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.880\nproject management,\nis really kind of a key if that's for us.\n\n226\n00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.210\nSo where in the world does it begin?\n\n227\n00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:30.430\nWell if I were to take\na look at these three\n\n228\n00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:36.330\ndifferent concepts again\nhere on my board here.\n\n229\n00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.330\nYou might think well it's simple.\n\n230\n00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.980\nIf I start to build an amusement park.\n\n231\n00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.020\nWell guess what?\n\n232\n00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:44.090\nThere's a lot times I don't\nhave a clue where to begin.\n\n233\n00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.880\nIf you were to ask me that,\nI've never built an amusement park.\n\n234\n00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.990\nNow, if you were to ask me today,\n\n235\n00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:51.690\nwhere would you begin, you might be of\nI know and then you start thinking and\n\n236\n00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.770\nyou realize that I don't\nhave a clue where to begin.\n\n237\n00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:54.860\nAnd I hate to say it,\n\n238\n00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:59.160\nthe one that I'm apart of which is\nmigrating users to Office 365 and\n\n239\n00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.210\nalso doing training for other project\nmanagers here, I've done a lot of that.\n\n240\n00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:06.450\nNow here on the migrating,\nI can tell you exactly where to begin.\n\n241\n00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.840\nThat comes from past experience and\nunderstanding some of the things.\n\n242\n00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:13.110\nBut guess what, it didn't begin by\nsaying here's what we're gonna do and\n\n243\n00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.600\nlet's just do it.\n\n244\n00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.360\nIt all begins with what we\ncall an initiation phase.\n\n245\n00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.640\nAnd that means some type of pre-planning.\n\n246\n00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.130\nNow every single project though.\n\n247\n00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.710\nActually goes through\nmultiple phases here.\n\n248\n00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:30.330\nAnd we have a diagram that kind of tries\nto illustrate what we're talking about.\n\n249\n00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:34.330\nSo every single project that you end up on\n\n250\n00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.270\nreally begins over here on the left hand\nside, which is what we call initiation.\n\n251\n00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:43.180\nIt begins with an idea\nof what has to be done.\n\n252\n00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.440\nThat's what we have to understand.\n\n253\n00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.200\nA lot of times we don't know\nexactly what has to be done so\n\n254\n00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.020\nwe have to begin somewhere like that.\n\n255\n00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:53.040\nNow once we have that we don't just go\nokay I know what we actually want to do\n\n256\n00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.800\nand just start doing it.\n\n257\n00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.540\nWe actually then at\nthat point plan it out.\n\n258\n00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.580\nSo what has to be done so\n\n259\n00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.210\nthat we can accomplish what we think we're\ngoing to actually end up accomplishing.\n\n260\n00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:06.930\nFrom that point, once all the planning's\ndone, then we start to do it.\n\n261\n00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:08.420\nWe start to actually monitor control.\n\n262\n00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.350\nAnd even though a lot of times in\nproject management you see them listed\n\n263\n00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:16.930\nas initiation, planning,\nexecution, monitoring and\n\n264\n00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:20.120\ncontrolling, and\nthen closing out of the project.\n\n265\n00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:26.130\nIn reality monitoring and controlling, and\nexecution, happen almost simultaneously.\n\n266\n00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:28.680\nIt's almost like a tennis game.\n\n267\n00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.530\nI execute something and now my project\nmanager like Daniel comes back,\n\n268\n00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:34.250\ngoes, wait a minute here.\n\n269\n00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:38.180\nWhat are the steps that you actually took\nbecause I'm not seeing the results I think\n\n270\n00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.400\nI'm seeing here.\n\n271\n00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.760\nDaniel does some type of quality testing.\n\n272\n00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.170\nAnd he goes Ronnie that's\njust not up to the standard.\n\n273\n00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.190\nIf I had done all of the execution and\n\n274\n00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.180\nthen Daniel came through at the very\nend and goes I'm starting to see this.\n\n275\n00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.260\nWhat would I have to do again?\n\n276\n00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.690\nI'd still have to go along and go okay,\nwell, let me restart that line again and\n\n277\n00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:56.890\nreproduce it.\n\n278\n00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:58.350\nThat's why these things go hand in hand.\n\n279\n00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.600\nYou're gonna see that it's kind\nof an unusual breakdown here,\n\n280\n00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.940\nwhere in that execution, we do have those\nstop gap measures that said, Ronnie you're\n\n281\n00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.770\ndoing this wrong or you're not doing it\nat the pace that it needs to be done.\n\n282\n00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.860\nOr it's not up to the quality\nthat we actually need here.\n\n283\n00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.140\nSo you actually end up seeing that those\ntwo end up going just about hand in hand,\n\n284\n00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.130\neven though we'll talk about\nthem in sequential order.\n\n285\n00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.710\nIt's almost impossible for\nus to explain them and\n\n286\n00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:23.730\ngo yeah here's what has to\nhappen almost simultaneously.\n\n287\n00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:26.640\nAnd then of course,\nhow do we actually know when we're done?\n\n288\n00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.590\nAnd that is pretty much the key,\nis understanding what has to happen,\n\n289\n00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:34.170\nwho's responsible now that we're\nactually done with the project for\n\n290\n00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:35.790\nthe ongoing operation of it.\n\n291\n00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:39.690\nAnd we'll see all of those processes\nduring this entire show that we\n\n292\n00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:40.720\ngo through.\n\n293\n00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.860\nAnd it's actually gonna be important\nthat we keep those things delineated,\n\n294\n00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:47.170\nbecause in project management,\nthe sequencing is important in that way.\n\n295\n00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.030\nThe best place for\n\n296\n00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:54.430\nus to begin is by focusing in on what\nwe call the initiation phase here.\n\n297\n00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.112\nIs where we are going to start.\n\n298\n00:14:56.112 --> 00:14:59.700\nAll right,\nI have made a little diagram for us so\n\n299\n00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.450\nthat we can at least begin to understand.\n\n300\n00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.860\nAnd I do have these shaky hands\nbecause this is where it really\n\n301\n00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.710\nbegins the planning of some\nof the things that we need.\n\n302\n00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:08.630\nThere has to be an agreement.\n\n303\n00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.490\nSomebody has an idea\nthat needs to be done.\n\n304\n00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.160\nYou might be a project manager.\n\n305\n00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.590\nAnd you actually have the know how or\nyou will have the know how to understand\n\n306\n00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:21.140\nwhat has to actually go on before\nthat deliverable can be accomplished.\n\n307\n00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:27.190\nWhat we tend to call this\nin the official PMP terms,\n\n308\n00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:28.450\nthe project management professional.\n\n309\n00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:32.940\nYou know I say, well Ronnie we're\ndoing COMP Tia, project plus here.\n\n310\n00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:37.170\nWell a lot of the terms that you guys end\nup seeing in the COMP Tia project plus\n\n311\n00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.530\nactually come from the PMI.\n\n312\n00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:44.962\nThat project management international,\nand also the PMP standards as well.\n\n313\n00:15:44.962 --> 00:15:49.800\nSo that's actually very important for us,\nwhere as in PMP land you see the term\n\n314\n00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.218\ninitiation, in project plus you\nhear the term, pre-project setup.\n\n315\n00:15:54.218 --> 00:15:57.469\nAnd they are pretty much the same thing,\nthey mean the same thing,\n\n316\n00:15:57.469 --> 00:15:58.468\nhere at this point.\n\n317\n00:15:58.468 --> 00:16:01.228\nAnd the terms come from a handbook.\n\n318\n00:16:01.228 --> 00:16:05.665\nThat you normally do get from PMI,\ncalled the PMBOK,\n\n319\n00:16:05.665 --> 00:16:11.286\nthe Project Management Book of Knowledge,\nand it's in the fifth or\n\n320\n00:16:11.286 --> 00:16:16.000\nsixth edition as of the shooting\nof this show today.\n\n321\n00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.190\nSo you'll actually see some of\nthe terminologies will actually\n\n322\n00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.506\nbe interchangeable in there and so\na lot of times you will see that.\n\n323\n00:16:22.506 --> 00:16:26.997\nAnd the initiation is that is where you\nare coming to an agreement of what has to\n\n324\n00:16:26.997 --> 00:16:27.600\nbe done.\n\n325\n00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.980\nAnd so the first thing that we have to\nactually be able to understand then if we\n\n326\n00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:37.000\nare potential project managers\nis to identify the project and\n\n327\n00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.990\nwe've got to actually know how we\ncan actually identify a project.\n\n328\n00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:44.970\nAnd this comes in between what\nwe call distinguishing, right?\n\n329\n00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:49.050\nBetween what is regular work,\nongoing work, and\n\n330\n00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.300\nwhat makes a project as being different.\n\n331\n00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.010\nMost of the time when something\nlike this happens here and\n\n332\n00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:59.080\nwe start talking about identifying the\nproject, somebody may have an idea, but\n\n333\n00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.500\nit doesn't actually become a project and\nthe reason why is that it may not actually\n\n334\n00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.580\nmeet the requirements of what we\nactually do to identify a project.\n\n335\n00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:08.920\nThere are some times when we think\nabout it and go, hey you know,\n\n336\n00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.170\nthis would be a better idea for us to do.\n\n337\n00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:15.040\nAnd we implement it and we go, and\nthat's the way that we continue to do it.\n\n338\n00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.390\nWell, there's no real project in that.\n\n339\n00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:20.590\nBut lets say that we change the entire\nsystem of how we do things.\n\n340\n00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:24.220\nWell that might now be a project because\nwe actually started off with one thing and\n\n341\n00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.490\nnow we're changing it so\n\n342\n00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:29.460\nwe're improving in on some\nprocess that we also did as well.\n\n343\n00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.990\nSo the official type of,\nI don't want to say official.\n\n344\n00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:38.592\nThe way that it's worded I think is more,\nbecause in the way that the PMBOK works\n\n345\n00:17:38.592 --> 00:17:44.390\nand PMI works is that, they say there's\nno official rules to project management.\n\n346\n00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:48.120\nSo that means you can do it however you\nwant to, as long as you want to do it.\n\n347\n00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.850\nBut what they're proposing is\nwhat a book of guidelines.\n\n348\n00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.080\nA book of best practices,\nis what they're saying.\n\n349\n00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.940\nSo I want to say that when yes\nyou see this sentence here\n\n350\n00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.138\nyou do see it worded this way.\n\n351\n00:17:59.138 --> 00:18:03.540\nIn the PMBOK, as well as when you actually\ntake a look at the way CompTIA words it\n\n352\n00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.180\nas well is to identify\na project as a project,\n\n353\n00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:12.380\nas a temporary endeavor that has\na definite beginning and ending date,\n\n354\n00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:18.360\nand as the result of a unique product,\nservice, or some type of result.\n\n355\n00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.560\nNow that's a whole mouthful, would\nactually understand what a project is, but\n\n356\n00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.870\nwhat does it break down to then for you\nand I to actually have to understand that?\n\n357\n00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:30.660\nWell when it comes down to this idea\nof what this temporary endeavor is,\n\n358\n00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.740\nand let me see if I can\nactually highlight right there.\n\n359\n00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.060\nWhat this temporary endeavor is, it means\nthat we have to understand something,\n\n360\n00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.839\nis that we're working\nwithin time constraints.\n\n361\n00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.030\nAnd is actually what we talked about.\n\n362\n00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:46.460\nNow when we talked about that idea of the\ntime string and that temporary endeavor,\n\n363\n00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:50.470\nit doesn't necessarily mean that\nthe project's always gonna be short,\n\n364\n00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:54.440\nnot in the length or\nthe overall duration of it.\n\n365\n00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:59.610\nWhat we are talking about is that once\nthe work is done, it's done, its over.\n\n366\n00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:03.880\nIt doesn't continue on to actually\njust live on by itself, and\n\n367\n00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.170\nthe work on the project\ncontinues on forever and ever.\n\n368\n00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:11.130\nSo this is what we talk about in terms of\na temporary endeavor, is understanding\n\n369\n00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:15.920\nthat we are working within those time\nconstraints is what we have to do.\n\n370\n00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.490\nThe other thing that we also need to know\nIs that it has a definite beginning and\n\n371\n00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.520\nending date like we talked about,\nand it has results here.\n\n372\n00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.150\nSo the results are about we need to\nunderstand what it is that we're going to\n\n373\n00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:30.400\naccomplish, so that there is some\nproduct at the end, some result,\n\n374\n00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:34.750\nsome service that ends up happening\nthat is what we want to accomplish.\n\n375\n00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:38.890\nIt's not just that we want to\ncontinue to make sure business grows.\n\n376\n00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.397\nThat's ongoing work right,\n\n377\n00:19:40.397 --> 00:19:43.724\nwe wanna make sure that our business\ncontinues to be profitable.\n\n378\n00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:46.080\nThat actually required on-going work.\n\n379\n00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.020\nBut that there is some product at\nthe end that we want to produce,\n\n380\n00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:53.690\nthere's some service improvement\nproject that we actually have to do.\n\n381\n00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:57.480\nThere's something that we believe is gonna\nbring better production to our network,\n\n382\n00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:02.130\nto the people that we work with that\nthey need a change from one system to\n\n383\n00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:06.130\na newer system, whatever it might\nbe that there is that idea.\n\n384\n00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.850\nAnd then of course\n\n385\n00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.918\nknow when you're actually supposed\nto accomplish the project as well.\n\n386\n00:20:11.918 --> 00:20:17.270\nKnow when you've actually accomplished\nyour project and I actually\n\n387\n00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:20.690\nwrote these down in different questions\nto try and help me remember this.\n\n388\n00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:21.930\nAnd that means that look,\n\n389\n00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:25.270\nit's not up to you to decide\nwhen everything's done, okay.\n\n390\n00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.770\nIt's actually when you say hey,\n\n391\n00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:30.740\nhere's what needs to be done, how do\nyou know when you're finished doing it?\n\n392\n00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.910\nSo that there's actually clear\nguidelines that say yes,\n\n393\n00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:37.040\nyou've actually met this level of standard\nyou've done everything that you need to\n\n394\n00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.960\nand so you know that this\nis what ends up happening.\n\n395\n00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.820\nSo some of the questions again, remember.\n\n396\n00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:45.800\nThat if you actually start to say hey,\nhow do I identify a project, ask.\n\n397\n00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.480\nDo you know what your time constraint is?\n\n398\n00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.030\nIs it a temporary endeavor?\n\n399\n00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:52.740\nOkay, you know what you\nactually want to accomplish.\n\n400\n00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.550\nWhat is the unique products, service or\nresult that you're looking for?\n\n401\n00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.250\nOkay, you know what you\nneed to accomplish.\n\n402\n00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.900\nThat's the one that I forgot there.\n\n403\n00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.280\nWhich in other words you actually say,\n\n404\n00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.870\nhey I know what actually has to be in\nplace for us to get that product out.\n\n405\n00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:08.430\nA lot of times I have a great idea,\n\n406\n00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:13.410\nbut I don't know what it takes to get\nthat product out and done, to do that.\n\n407\n00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.450\nAnd there was one I was\njust thinking about.\n\n408\n00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:19.130\nBecause we talk about knives a lot around\nhere cuz we like sharpening them and\n\n409\n00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.280\nwe like buying them but\n\n410\n00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.250\nthe key is one day I think this is\nwhat's going to happen with Daniel.\n\n411\n00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.590\nHe's not going to be satisfied\nwith just buying a knife.\n\n412\n00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.040\nOne day he's going to come in,\nand I know Daniel,\n\n413\n00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.110\nhe's going to say, I want to build my own.\n\n414\n00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:35.500\nAnd when he talks about\nmaking his own knife, well,\n\n415\n00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.580\nDaniel at this point knows that's\nwhat he wants to accomplish.\n\n416\n00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:43.110\nBut does Daniel actually know,\nwhat does he need to accomplish that.\n\n417\n00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.660\nHe might go, yeah, I'll just go out and\nbuy a piece of steel and\n\n418\n00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.790\njust start carving into that shape and\nI should be done.\n\n419\n00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:51.330\nAnd then, now all of a sudden, Daniel\nstarts talking to someone and goes, no,\n\n420\n00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:52.820\nyou're gonna need to forge that thing.\n\n421\n00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:53.800\nWell what do I need to forge?\n\n422\n00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.400\nAnd he's gonna say, my oven?\n\n423\n00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.800\nIt's not gonna be hot enough and\nhe's gonna start finding out those things.\n\n424\n00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.780\nA project manager will take this time\nduring the initiation as he's identifying\n\n425\n00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.490\nit, to start saying hey.\n\n426\n00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.850\nHere's what I know needs to actually,\n\n427\n00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:10.090\nwhat I need to have here\nto accomplish that as well.\n\n428\n00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:13.520\nSo getting that understanding\nof what that solid idea\n\n429\n00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.520\nof how you distinguish\nbetween what's ongoing work.\n\n430\n00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.410\nSomething that functions that works\nevery day that does everything that we\n\n431\n00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:23.810\nwant to do, Is different from a project,\ncompleting what we want and the end\n\n432\n00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:26.310\nresult, Daniel will probably have a very\nnice and fine knife once he actually\n\n433\n00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:30.225\nget everything down and\ndoes everything that he needs to do.\n\n434\n00:22:30.225 --> 00:22:33.350\nBut those are the things that we need to\nbe able to do right at the beginning.\n\n435\n00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:37.330\nVery important, because what we may find\nout is that we don't start with this stuff\n\n436\n00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:40.320\nis that all of a sudden our project\nactually begins as something nice and\n\n437\n00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.220\nsomething that we believe will help.\n\n438\n00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.880\nTo being an ongoing piece of work that\nnever finishes, and you wanna talk about\n\n439\n00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:50.380\nsomething like this as an example what\nthey call the big dig up in Massachusetts.\n\n440\n00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:54.200\nA tunnel that started I don't know\nwhen some time in the past 35 years,\n\n441\n00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.070\nsupposed to be accomplished in\na few years is still happening,\n\n442\n00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:01.190\nstill going on now, 30, 40 years later.\n\n443\n00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.690\nAnd it's just never finished.\n\n444\n00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:05.850\nWell it's a tunnel, you would think,\nyou go from one side of the mountain to\n\n445\n00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:09.170\nthe other side of the mountain, and once\nyou hit the other side it should be done.\n\n446\n00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:10.520\nBut there's maintenance that goes on, and\n\n447\n00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.690\ninstead of them actually\nturning that over and\n\n448\n00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.410\ndoing other things, it's just continued to\nbe a project that's just never finished.\n\n449\n00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.610\nWell, that's not the type\nof project we want and so\n\n450\n00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:22.020\nwe have to be able to distinguish that,\nwhat is actually gonna be a project and\n\n451\n00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.840\nwhat's gonna be the difference\nbetween ongoing work that we have.\n\n452\n00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.370\n>> And that's the real danger,\nright Ronnie?\n\n453\n00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:28.660\nIs to go hey, let's dig a tunnel.\n\n454\n00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:33.060\nOkay, well grab a shovel buddy and\neverybody starts digging and go, we're\n\n455\n00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:37.810\nstarting to have a bunch of landslides or\nthe cave keeps falling in on itself.\n\n456\n00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:42.150\nWhat are we gonna do and\nyou start to attack problems as they arise\n\n457\n00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:45.100\ninstead of trying to surround yourself\nwith experts and people that know\n\n458\n00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.530\nthey've dug other tunnels,\nthey have the experience and knowledge.\n\n459\n00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:51.260\nGoing back to Ronnie's knife,\nI do love knives and\n\n460\n00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.900\nRonnie's probably right, one day.\n\n461\n00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.398\nI've already had it in my mind,\nhow hard can it be?\n\n462\n00:23:56.398 --> 00:23:59.628\nI would be a project of one,\nI would be just one person.\n\n463\n00:23:59.628 --> 00:24:02.888\nI would be the guy doing the work,\nI would be the guy planning the work.\n\n464\n00:24:02.888 --> 00:24:04.848\nSo that's a specific case.\n\n465\n00:24:04.848 --> 00:24:08.730\nBut you gotta remember that's probably not\nnormal, especially as a project manager.\n\n466\n00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:09.900\nYou're gonna have a team of people.\n\n467\n00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:15.070\nYou're gonna surround yourself with the\nresources, be it probably both people and\n\n468\n00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:19.160\nthe materials that you need to accomplish\nthe goal that you have set before you.\n\n469\n00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.770\nAnd if you don't know what that goal\nis you're not gonna know what you need.\n\n470\n00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.430\nYou're not gonna know\nwho you're gonna have to\n\n471\n00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:26.800\nhave to make that goal come to life.\n\n472\n00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.380\n>> There's no doubt, and\nDaniel brings up a great point.\n\n473\n00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.120\nWell how big can projects be,\nor how small can they be?\n\n474\n00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.660\nThey can be as small as one person.\n\n475\n00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.330\nDaniel can actually plan that project out.\n\n476\n00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:40.700\nThat he's gonna make himself a hand\nholded knife or even a sword.\n\n477\n00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.310\nIt just depends on what he wants to do.\n\n478\n00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.660\nI think both processes are a little\nbit different here, but\n\n479\n00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.320\nthey do rely on some of the same skills.\n\n480\n00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.640\nBut he can do it as a one person project.\n\n481\n00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.692\nBut in big projects,\n\n482\n00:24:49.692 --> 00:24:53.000\nnow this is where that management\ncomes in a little bit more.\n\n483\n00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.670\nYou no longer have that direct,\nI know what I want to do and\n\n484\n00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:57.840\nI know how to do it to\nbe able to communicate.\n\n485\n00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.280\nNow you have to actually manage other\npeople to get that work done as well.\n\n486\n00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.500\nSo they can actually range in any size.\n\n487\n00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.920\nThey can actually range in any time.\n\n488\n00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.410\nThere are projects that\ndo take years to finish.\n\n489\n00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:10.350\nThere's projects that only take just\na little bit of time to finish, but\n\n490\n00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:12.600\nthey actually all\nare treated in the same way.\n\n491\n00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.390\nAnd they should begin right here.\n\n492\n00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:18.100\nThe initiation stage is pretty\nmuch where we have to begin.\n\n493\n00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.290\nNow we want talk that\na little bit more here too.\n\n494\n00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.870\nSo once we actually get started\nwith being able to say yes,\n\n495\n00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:27.070\nthis is actually gonna be\na project we have on hand\n\n496\n00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.880\nwe need to be able to validate\nthe project as well, okay?\n\n497\n00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.010\nSo we take a look at my screen again.\n\n498\n00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:34.490\nHere in the lower left hand corner\n\n499\n00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:39.300\nthis is where we begin to do what we call\njustifying the existence of that project.\n\n500\n00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:43.850\nThere are many projects that are always\nbrought up to companies, constantly, okay?\n\n501\n00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:45.030\nPeople are constantly submitting.\n\n502\n00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:46.180\nHere's what they think needs to be done.\n\n503\n00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.180\nHere's what needs to be done.\n\n504\n00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.384\nHere's six things that we should\nhave done ten years ago, okay.\n\n505\n00:25:50.384 --> 00:25:52.970\nYou name it, there's always this.\n\n506\n00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:58.030\nBut there has to be a way that you say,\nhere's the project that we need to do,\n\n507\n00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.270\nand there had to be some judgement of it.\n\n508\n00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:04.070\nSo we talked about the idea of validating\nthat project and what ends up happening is\n\n509\n00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:08.540\nwe can prepare what we call a business\ncase to help us out in doing that.\n\n510\n00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:13.030\nThe business case is divided into two\nparticular subsections here, right?\n\n511\n00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:16.140\nSo when we talk about a business case all\nwe are really doing is we are trying to\n\n512\n00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.230\njustify the project's existence.\n\n513\n00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:20.800\nNow, why in the world would\nwe do something like that.\n\n514\n00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.390\nWell, there's a lot of different\nthings that can happen, okay?\n\n515\n00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:27.230\nThere's actually,\nwhat we call business needs, that go on.\n\n516\n00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:30.450\nThe very fact is you may find out\nthat there's a market demand for\n\n517\n00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:32.910\nwhatever product that you\nthink is actually out there.\n\n518\n00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:36.660\nSo this is where you can get caught\nbehind the eight ball a lot of times too.\n\n519\n00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:41.210\nThe very fact is, yeah, the market may be\nsaying nobody's actually filling this gap,\n\n520\n00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:42.960\nand you choose to actually go ahead and\n\n521\n00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.030\ndive on into it to be able\nto do something like this.\n\n522\n00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:49.630\nYou may also end up finding out that\nthis may be a customer request.\n\n523\n00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:53.960\nIn other words that hey look, here's a one\ncustomer that says we need to do this.\n\n524\n00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.660\nAnd we told them that we would do it, and\nwe'll go ahead and do something like that.\n\n525\n00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.460\nIt could be that you find out\nsomething about your own business.\n\n526\n00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:04.630\nThat you have actually been operating\nperfectly fine, but is right on the edge\n\n527\n00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:09.770\nof legal requirements and not and\nnow some regulatory agency has come in and\n\n528\n00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:14.590\nsays, here on this EPA side here,\nyou gotta clean up a little bit more.\n\n529\n00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:17.250\nYou may now have to actually\nbring on a project to help you\n\n530\n00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.860\nget back in line with\nstuff like that as well.\n\n531\n00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:23.510\nSo, it could be ecological,\nit could be legal, could be many things.\n\n532\n00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:27.110\nSometimes it's just a social\nresponsibility that your company has too,\n\n533\n00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:30.650\nso there's many different business needs\nout there that help you to justify what\n\n534\n00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:31.760\nyou also have.\n\n535\n00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.390\nThe justification also\ncomes in terms of benefits.\n\n536\n00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:37.150\nWhy is this good for my company?\n\n537\n00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:40.660\nWell, any of those that we just listed\nas business need could be good.\n\n538\n00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.320\nIf I actually hit a market demand and\nI hit it at the right time and\n\n539\n00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.030\nI fill that gap in.\n\n540\n00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:49.620\nWell, man, that could be an incredible\njustification for us spending the amount\n\n541\n00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:53.220\nof money we're gonna spend on\nthis particular project as well.\n\n542\n00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.640\nNow the other ways that we can do this,\n\n543\n00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.210\nof course, is that we may end up seeing,\ncan we actually afford it?\n\n544\n00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:00.020\nFeasibility studied, right?\n\n545\n00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.466\nThe very fact is, we may find out,\nhere's what the project is.\n\n546\n00:28:02.466 --> 00:28:03.807\nHere's what we wnat to accomplish.\n\n547\n00:28:03.807 --> 00:28:06.660\nWe don't have the resources to do it.\n\n548\n00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.360\nWe don't have the time to do it,\n\n549\n00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.220\ncuz we actually don't have everything\nthat we need on hand here.\n\n550\n00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.600\nSo you may end up finding out\nthat you don't have the ability\n\n551\n00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.440\nto do all the things\nthat you want to as well.\n\n552\n00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:21.330\nEven inside of businesses you may find\nout it just doesn't fit what you can do.\n\n553\n00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:25.170\nYou may end up going, man this is\na great project and you go, but\n\n554\n00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.350\nwe're not that company.\n\n555\n00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:27.850\nWe just can't do that.\n\n556\n00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:31.650\nSo there are things that will justify\nthat particular project existing for\n\n557\n00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:33.670\nyour company, so\nthat you can validate, may not.\n\n558\n00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:36.570\nAnother thing that you also have to\ndo is you have to bring it before\n\n559\n00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:40.270\nothers that will help you to\nmake that project a reality.\n\n560\n00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:43.550\nAnd that's what we call the idea\nhere of identifying stakeholders and\n\n561\n00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:46.150\nmaking sure that they\nunderstand what's going on.\n\n562\n00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:49.300\nYou will get stakeholders that\nyou have to get on your side.\n\n563\n00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.080\nThat's what it comes down to.\n\n564\n00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.420\nPeople are always looking out for\nthe interest of the company.\n\n565\n00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:57.910\nYou have to actually be able to convince\nsome of those people, identify who they\n\n566\n00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:01.990\nare, who do you need to get on your side\nif you want this project to go ahead and\n\n567\n00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.770\nbegin here, to do that.\n\n568\n00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:06.400\nVery difficult for you to work\nagainst somebody, and I mean it.\n\n569\n00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.820\nEven if they don't have\nany hand in your project.\n\n570\n00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:12.640\nFor somebody that actually knows that they\nhave power and you can't do anything.\n\n571\n00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.560\nYou can validate it all day long,\nbut there has to be a way for\n\n572\n00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.590\nyou to identify who those stakeholders\nare and get them on your side.\n\n573\n00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:19.930\nThere's a lot going on here.\n\n574\n00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:23.480\n>> An interesting illustration going\nback to the idea of a feasibility,\n\n575\n00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.230\nand does this align with what we do,\nRight?\n\n576\n00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:29.180\nIs I read a lot about military history.\n\n577\n00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:30.450\nI think I find it fascinating.\n\n578\n00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:33.850\nI enjoy military and\nI salute all of our military guys.\n\n579\n00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:37.610\nAnd I was reading a book on Delta Force,\nwhich is the elite special forces for\n\n580\n00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.940\nthe Army, and they live or\n\n581\n00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:44.660\nthey train right down the street\nfrom a Cornflakes factory.\n\n582\n00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:48.330\nAnd so they came up with a statement when\nthey were trying to figure out how to blow\n\n583\n00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:52.050\na door off it's hinges without taking the\nwhole wall out or how do we get inside of\n\n584\n00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:55.180\na plane without terrorists knowing the\nwe're on the wing and that kind of thing.\n\n585\n00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:57.037\nAnd he said,\nwell we're not making Cornflakes.\n\n586\n00:29:57.037 --> 00:30:00.140\n[LAUGH] So and that's a the right idea.\n\n587\n00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:00.950\nThat is not what they do.\n\n588\n00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:02.880\nThey do not make cornflakes for a living.\n\n589\n00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.780\nThey infiltrate planes.\n\n590\n00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.181\nThey blow doors off of hinges.\n\n591\n00:30:06.181 --> 00:30:07.681\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's what they do.\n\n592\n00:30:07.681 --> 00:30:10.772\nIf youre business is not one of migrating,\nif you're bridge\n\n593\n00:30:10.772 --> 00:30:14.478\nbuilders you probably not going to\nask your guys to migrate uses 365.\n\n594\n00:30:14.478 --> 00:30:15.987\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It just doesn’t make sense to do that.\n\n595\n00:30:15.987 --> 00:30:17.750\nThat’s not what they do for a living.\n\n596\n00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:19.950\nSo you do have to keep that feasibility.\n\n597\n00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:21.910\nIs this something that we even do?\n\n598\n00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:27.220\nWe're not in that business so that's not\nsomething we're gonna endeavour into.\n\n599\n00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.640\n>> There's no doubt that you have you\nto think about this thing when it comes\n\n600\n00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.070\ndown how that project is\ngonna end up developing.\n\n601\n00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:36.870\nAnd you want to think about all that stuff\nbefore you actually begin to spend a dime.\n\n602\n00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:38.110\nYou really do, right?\n\n603\n00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:41.280\nBecause once you start spending\nmoney it now becomes something\n\n604\n00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.240\nthat's associated with a cost,\nwhich means somebody's gonna pay for\n\n605\n00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.050\nit somewhere, and\nthat's when people get upset.\n\n606\n00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:48.600\nWhen you go,\nyeah I just didn't feel like doing it.\n\n607\n00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.670\nYeah we just didn't like it anymore.\n\n608\n00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:51.622\n>> Didn't really work out.\n\n609\n00:30:51.622 --> 00:30:56.070\n>> Yeah, idn't work out, but that's why\nwe do it during this initiation phase,\n\n610\n00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:58.420\nduring this pre-project setup as well.\n\n611\n00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.870\nNow, Daniel, there's a lot more for\nus to go through,\n\n612\n00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:03.460\nbut I see that we're kind of\nat the end of our time here.\n\n613\n00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:06.380\n>> Yeah, we've ticked our last tock for\nthis episode that's for sure.\n\n614\n00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.500\nBut Episode two is right\naround the corner.\n\n615\n00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.210\nRonnie's gonna be back.\n\n616\n00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:10.650\nHopefully you'll be back, as well.\n\n617\n00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:13.000\nAs for this one, we'll go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n618\n00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.740\nI've been your host Daniel Lawry.\n\n619\n00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:15.548\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n620\n00:31:15.548 --> 00:31:17.519\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n621\n00:31:17.519 --> 00:31:25.090\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.570\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, well,\n\n4\n00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.740\nwe are continuing on with our project\nplus series, so welcome back to that.\n\n5\n00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.330\nJoining us back in the studio\nagain today is our good friend,\n\n6\n00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.150\nmentor who is guiding this train,\nwhich is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.250\nRonnie, welcome back to the show.\n\n8\n00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.270\n>> Thank you for having me back on the\nshow as we continue on taking a look at\n\n9\n00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.680\nthe Comptia project plus here.\n\n10\n00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.460\nAnd we are in the midst of actually\ntaking a look at the initiation,\n\n11\n00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.880\nthe pre-project set up, and\nsome of the things we need to make sure\n\n12\n00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.240\nthat we had before we even think about\nwhat project it actually is gonna go on\n\n13\n00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.190\nbecause a lot of times where it actually\nends up making or breaking is right here.\n\n14\n00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.130\nThe very fact that we go ahead before we\nspend a single dime, before we actually\n\n15\n00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.920\nhave any work done, that we've thought\nthrough the process of what needs to be\n\n16\n00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.790\naccomplished What do we have on hand\nto accomplish it and making sure we\n\n17\n00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.820\nknow what it is that we're actually going\nto end up creating in the beginning here.\n\n18\n00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.630\nSo let's take a look at where we are and\nwhere we've come up to up into this point.\n\n19\n00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.000\nAnd then where we're actually\ngonna pick up from this point on.\n\n20\n00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.740\nSo when it comes down to it, here it is.\n\n21\n00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.840\nI've used this previously\nin another episode here.\n\n22\n00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.470\nWe're talking about\nthe pre-project set up.\n\n23\n00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.990\nAnd then the previous edition\nhere on episode we took a look at\n\n24\n00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.000\nidentifying the project.\n\n25\n00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.900\nRemember that the key here or\nthe goal here, right, is not so\n\n26\n00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.780\nmuch to be very specific.\n\n27\n00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.800\nBut it's to ensure that\nwhat you have is a project.\n\n28\n00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.620\nOkay?\nIt's not just ongoing work.\n\n29\n00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.440\nIt's not Just another company\nthat's gonna be created and\n\n30\n00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.310\nbuilt that lasts forever, but that what\nyou're actually working on is a project.\n\n31\n00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.100\nProject managers need to be very clear\nabout what they are picking up and\n\n32\n00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.700\nthey know what they're actually working\nwith in terms of constraints and\n\n33\n00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.660\nmaking sure that this is actually\ngonna have a beginning and an end.\n\n34\n00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.400\nOkay, we also then ended that episode,\n\n35\n00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.370\ntaking a look at the idea of\nvalidating a project as well.\n\n36\n00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.730\nWe want to make sure that we can justify\nits existence, we might take a look at\n\n37\n00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.100\ndifferent business cases, a market demand\nthat might be out there, a customer says\n\n38\n00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.200\nhere's what I need, the very fact that\nthere may be other considerations there.\n\n39\n00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.615\nSocial, ecological, you name it, there\nmay be other considerations we take into\n\n40\n00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:21.600\naccount, as we actually say, hey, this is\nwhy this project needs to be in existence.\n\n41\n00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.650\nAnd then we also briefly talked about\nidentifying those stake holders\n\n42\n00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.020\nwho have influence over your project that\nwe we have to have a clear understanding\n\n43\n00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.540\nthat these are the people that we\nreally need on our side and also,\n\n44\n00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.610\nwe may also identify of course there's\npeople that may not ever be on our side\n\n45\n00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.600\nBut we're gonna actually figure out how,\nyou know, we treat them respectfully.\n\n46\n00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.850\nDeal with them in\nthe best way that we can.\n\n47\n00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.870\nWe also talk about just why in the world\nwe have project management, you know, and\n\n48\n00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.970\nwhy we need it.\n\n49\n00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.680\nSo now, as we continue on taking a look at\nthat phase, once we identify the project,\n\n50\n00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.930\nunless we validate\nthe actual project here.\n\n51\n00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.560\nWe need to go ahead and,\n\n52\n00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.680\nnow that we have this selection,\nwe'll find out that there's actually many\n\n53\n00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.050\nprojects like we've talked about before\nthat are always being presented to you.\n\n54\n00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.050\nThat means that what you'll end up with at\ntimes is that you might find that there's\n\n55\n00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.360\nnot only one good project that's\nactually available to you to do, But\n\n56\n00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.270\nthat they may be multiple projects\nof project initiations and\n\n57\n00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.250\nlittle projects goals that everybody has\nand now they're submitted you're taking\n\n58\n00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.300\na look at multiple different projects well\nyou as a single project manager you need\n\n59\n00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.130\nto to decide which one that you're going\nto be able to actual help to manage And\n\n60\n00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.390\ncome down through it and that's where we\nactually go into what we call the project\n\n61\n00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.140\nselection methods that we\ncan actually think of.\n\n62\n00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.960\nNow this one's actually\nfairly interesting because\n\n63\n00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.230\nit really depends on the size of\nthe organization, Daniel, here and\n\n64\n00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.300\nthat's why I said it's organizational\ndependent in certain things.\n\n65\n00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.810\nOkay?\n\n66\n00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.280\nSo we'll take for an example ITProTV.\n\n67\n00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.090\nOkay?\n\n68\n00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.190\nIf we want to actually do something,\nDaniel, let's say that we have an idea for\n\n69\n00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.790\na show, that you go,\nI know that's what I wanna do, we\n\n70\n00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.000\nreally don't have to go through any type\nof formal process, perse, right, Daniel?\n\n71\n00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.520\nWe just go to Don or\nto our creative director Peter and\n\n72\n00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.330\nsay, here's what we wanna do.\n\n73\n00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.920\nMake sense?\n\n74\n00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.160\nIt's kind of a very direct communication,\nand that's because we're\n\n75\n00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.170\na small company Just about everybody\nthat works in our company we know.\n\n76\n00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.480\nActually I can't think of somebody that\nworks in our company we don't know.\n\n77\n00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.440\nBut you may be working for\nan organization, I know Daniel did.\n\n78\n00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.030\nDaniel worked for a gigantic\norganization before he came to ITProTV.\n\n79\n00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.050\nDaniel did you know every single member\nof the insurance company you worked for?\n\n80\n00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.060\nEverybody that worked there.\n\n81\n00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.220\n>> I knew them all personally,\nevery last nuance of, no, of course not.\n\n82\n00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.880\nThere were so many people that\nit would have been impossible.\n\n83\n00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.750\nFor me to know everyone in that company.\n\n84\n00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.380\n>> So in this sense, Daniel, let's say\nthat you knew that there was a project\n\n85\n00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.540\nthat needed to be done at\nthe insurance company.\n\n86\n00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.920\nDid you go directly to that,\nthat you knew it would affect them,\n\n87\n00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.600\ndid you go to that people and\ngo, here's what I'm gonna do?\n\n88\n00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.240\nDid you say that, or did you bring\nit up to an administrator and say,\n\n89\n00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.430\nhere's what needs to be done for them,\ncuz this will actually help them improve?\n\n90\n00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.580\n>> This is a project that's gonna affect,\n\n91\n00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.940\ncuz I worked in an insurance company,\nthe claims users.\n\n92\n00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.740\nI would go to my manager and say hey I\nwould see that we would be more effective\n\n93\n00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.770\nif we did this for the claims department\nand maybe we should implement that.\n\n94\n00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.320\nAnd then they would take that and run it\nup the ladder and see how they thought\n\n95\n00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.740\nabout it, looked at the cost-benefit\nanalysis and do all the other stuff.\n\n96\n00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.330\nAll I did was suggest the thing.\n\n97\n00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.380\nYeah, and\nthat's what normally also happens too.\n\n98\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.970\nSo it's about the size\nmore than anything else.\n\n99\n00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.580\nIt's impractical for Daniel to go to\nevery single person that claims users and\n\n100\n00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.270\ngo, should I do this, should I not?\n\n101\n00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.270\nAnd then move on to the next person and\nthen, let's go ahead and\n\n102\n00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.790\nlet's start doing all this stuff.\n\n103\n00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.230\nWell, as the departments get larger,\nas the organization gets larger,\n\n104\n00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.050\nthere's a more formalized process in\nsaying, here's what needs to be done.\n\n105\n00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.170\nAnd Daniel kinda just took you through a,\n\n106\n00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.470\nI know I put him on the stop right there\nat the moment, but just an ad hoc way.\n\n107\n00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.400\nThat Daniel says,\nI know after actually dealing with some of\n\n108\n00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.810\nthe issues that I had to deal with them in\nthe IT department, That here's something\n\n109\n00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.920\nthat would streamline their\nprocess if we implemented this.\n\n110\n00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.240\nSo he doesn't actually just go ahead and\nimplement it himself, okay.\n\n111\n00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.710\nHe actually said look,\nhere's a project that needs to be done and\n\n112\n00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.640\nlet me run that up to\nwhoever the supervisor is.\n\n113\n00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.980\nThe supervisor then at that point\nactually does whatever he needs to,\n\n114\n00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.450\nto see if that project\ncan be accomplished or\n\n115\n00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.200\nif it needs to be accomplished According\nto maybe that team supervisor as well.\n\n116\n00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.340\nThey might say, well,\nthat sounds cool, but yeah,\n\n117\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.030\nI don't think we're gonna do that.\n\n118\n00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.540\nDaniel, he comes back, and\nhis supervisor says, we may do that,\n\n119\n00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:39.020\nbut it's not gonna be at this point.\n\n120\n00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.100\nAnd so,\nyou may have to live with that very fact.\n\n121\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.540\nSo, as a large organization, you do things\naccording to whatever the procedures are.\n\n122\n00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.540\nIn a fairly small organization where\nthere's normally direct administration,\n\n123\n00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.000\nyou know everybody that works for you.\n\n124\n00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.130\nThat's usually how it works, a lot easier.\n\n125\n00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.240\n>> Yeah, and a good illustration of that\ngoing back to my time at the insurance\n\n126\n00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.770\ncompany was we had a claim\nsoftware system, right?\n\n127\n00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.610\nIt was a third party system, we didn't\ndevelop it ourselves and what happens\n\n128\n00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.320\nwith software, it gets updated,\nit gets renewed, later versions come out.\n\n129\n00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.100\nWell, we don't go to our claims users and\nask them, hey,\n\n130\n00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.640\nwould you like it if we got the latest\nversion of this software and\n\n131\n00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.080\nreplaced everything that\nyou know how to use?\n\n132\n00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.680\nNo, we don't.\n\n133\n00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.520\nWe say, that's the latest\nsoftware that needs to be.\n\n134\n00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.050\nIt's got all the security fixes.\n\n135\n00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.290\nIt's got all the newest implementations\nof how claims needs to be run.\n\n136\n00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.120\nAnd that's what we're gonna do.\n\n137\n00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.410\nWe don't ask them we just do it,\nbecause that's what we need to do.\n\n138\n00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.130\nOf course I heard a lot of complaints\nabout that, many as a matter of fact.\n\n139\n00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:39.560\nWell this worked that way in 3.5, but\nin 5.6 it doesn't have that capability,\n\n140\n00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.390\ncan you show me how to make that happen?\n\n141\n00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.730\nMaybe, maybe not, I don't know.\n\n142\n00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.800\nBut we don't use 3.5 anymore, and\nagain, we didn't ask them whether or\n\n143\n00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.850\nnot they want us to migrate, we had no\nchoice, it was something we had to do.\n\n144\n00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:50.390\n>> Yeah.\nAnd so,\n\n145\n00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:54.306\nthat's where you also end up seeing,\nwhere project selection comes in too,\n\n146\n00:07:54.306 --> 00:07:58.120\nis the example that Daniel mentioned,\nis that the need of the moment here.\n\n147\n00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.316\nSo look, It's got to be done and\nso even though Daniel might go,\n\n148\n00:08:02.316 --> 00:08:05.760\nI want to do this project I\ndon't want to do that one.\n\n149\n00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.790\nIt didn't matter because the business\nneed actually now outweighs what\n\n150\n00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.950\ndesire Daniel had to do this\nother special side project.\n\n151\n00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.480\nSo the project selection in a large\norganization may be decided for\n\n152\n00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.690\nyou as a project manager that's\nwhat I'm really trying to get to.\n\n153\n00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.760\nWhereas in a smaller organization you\nguys are project managers you may be\n\n154\n00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.690\nthe one that even initiates,\nhere is what I believe the project is and\n\n155\n00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.940\nit may be where one person\nsays sounds cool, do it.\n\n156\n00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.590\nAnd then there it is you're off and\nyou're ready to go, but\n\n157\n00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.140\nyou can't count on that\nin every situation.\n\n158\n00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.820\nAs an organization continues to grow,\nright?\n\n159\n00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.730\nWhat would be a better idea is at the very\nbeginning, as we start realizing that now\n\n160\n00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.850\nI don't see Daniel day to day or I don't\nsee whoever I'm working with day to day,\n\n161\n00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.390\nthat we start going ahead and putting in\na more formalized process of saying hey,\n\n162\n00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.310\nhere's how we need to select this.\n\n163\n00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.390\nNow that does mean more meetings and\nstuff, and\n\n164\n00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:58.000\nI don't like meetings any more than\nanybody else does, but it's actually\n\n165\n00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.020\na better method because that mean's\nwe'll be doing it from the beginning\n\n166\n00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.660\ninstead of saying now we got to actually\nimplement and set something else up here.\n\n167\n00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.580\nNow speaking of that, once we\nunderstand whatever that process is,\n\n168\n00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.690\nwhether it's formalized or an informal\nmethod, there are ways that we can\n\n169\n00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:17.250\nactually make this a lot easier in\nterms of decisions by helping us,\n\n170\n00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.760\nby actually building in a process\nin that decision making technique.\n\n171\n00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.370\nThat we call benefits measurements.\n\n172\n00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.060\nNow a lot of benefits\nmeasurements they make sense.\n\n173\n00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.600\nSome of them are mathematical processes,\nsome of them are not.\n\n174\n00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.690\nBut just kinda realize that there\nare many of them that are out there and\n\n175\n00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.390\nwe need to go over just a few of them.\n\n176\n00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:39.540\nSo let me show you on my screen again\nsome of the list of things we tend to do.\n\n177\n00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.670\nDaniel you mentioned this first one,\nthis idea of this cost benefit analysis.\n\n178\n00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.210\nThat's probably the easiest one for\nmost companies to be able to do\n\n179\n00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:51.790\nis they understand how much it costs\nversus what it's really gonna do for them.\n\n180\n00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.640\nAnd every department does this.\n\n181\n00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.870\nThey normally sit and go look,\nhere's how much we're gonna have to spend.\n\n182\n00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.070\nBut is this actually gonna end up\nbringing us a benefit, analysis of that.\n\n183\n00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.030\nIs it worth it in the end of everything\nthat we have to go through and\n\n184\n00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.150\nput itself through?\n\n185\n00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:07.910\nTo give us the product that we want to.\n\n186\n00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:11.760\n>> This is the idea of spending\n$50,000 to make a million, right?\n\n187\n00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.620\nIt's totally worth spending $50,000 if you\n\n188\n00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.200\nare going to make a million dollars\noff of that $50,000 investment.\n\n189\n00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.730\nI would do that every day of the week.\n\n190\n00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:22.370\n>> Yeah, that would be awesome\nthat we could do all that.\n\n191\n00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.530\nBut sometimes, Daniel, even though that's\na great idea, and that's what we hope for,\n\n192\n00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:28.800\nright, is that the direct cost\nthat we spend in terms of money\n\n193\n00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.620\nbrings us a direct financial cost, but\n\n194\n00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.780\nwhat if we're able to make the million\ndollars in a different way, Daniel?\n\n195\n00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.330\nSo, let's say, Daniel, that the project\nthat he mentioned before here,\n\n196\n00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:44.429\nchanging the software ended up saving,\nlet's say everybody, 15 minutes a day.\n\n197\n00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:46.720\nIn terms of what they do in other words,\n\n198\n00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.250\nyou actually gain 15 minutes of\nproductivity from everybody.\n\n199\n00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:54.320\nAnd I know this is kind of very micro\nlevel here, but 15 minutes a day for\n\n200\n00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.530\neverybody and\nthey do five days a week of work?\n\n201\n00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:02.430\nThey get an hour and 15 minutes, hour and\na quarter every day, and you have 100\n\n202\n00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:07.330\nemployees working for you that means you\nactually saved 100 hours of productivity,\n\n203\n00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.920\nor you gained 100 hours of productivity,\ndoing the same amount of work.\n\n204\n00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.000\nBecause of that software, able to\nactually save you 15 minutes a day.\n\n205\n00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.020\nNow you multiply that out over the,\nlet's say,\n\n206\n00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:23.730\n48 weeks of the year that you end up\nworking, well all the sudden, the benefit,\n\n207\n00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.760\neven though it doesn't turn out to be $1\nmillion, as far as actual cash that Daniel\n\n208\n00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.630\ncan just fling up in the air and\nlight his cigars with, or anything.\n\n209\n00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.370\nBut it turned out for\nthe company that they measure that out and\n\n210\n00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.500\ngo, yeah that's worth it.\n\n211\n00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.670\nThat absolutely is worth it.\n\n212\n00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:41.050\nIt's intangible in a sense, but\nit actually does turn around and\n\n213\n00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.150\nactually bring in more money.\n\n214\n00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.340\n>> I remember, I don't remember the exact\nstory, but it was something to the effect\n\n215\n00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.970\nof an airline\n>> They put one less olive in the salad or\n\n216\n00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.510\nsomething like that.\n\n217\n00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.112\nSay you're doing $35,000 a month or\nwhatever on salads.\n\n218\n00:11:54.112 --> 00:11:57.720\nThey were giving out on their flights,\n$35,000 a month times 12 months,\n\n219\n00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:02.240\nthey saved a lot of money in their\nbusiness and that goes towards profits.\n\n220\n00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.710\nAnd it was something little they did,\nthey had to figure out one thing So\n\n221\n00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.210\nit could be just like\nwhat Ronnie was saying.\n\n222\n00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.380\nIt's not really a tangible item\nthat you would normally think of,\n\n223\n00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.950\nin cost of, I'm gonna spend this and\ntherefore I'm gonna make this much money.\n\n224\n00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:17.660\nIt could be I'm not gonna spend this and\ntherefore I'm gonna make more money.\n\n225\n00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.460\nOr I'm not gonna do this and\ntherefore we're gonna be more productive,\n\n226\n00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.210\nand therefore we're gonna make more money.\n\n227\n00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:26.630\nAnd most projects settle around\nthe idea of being profitable for\n\n228\n00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.650\nthe business that they're\ndoing the project for.\n\n229\n00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.230\nWe live in a capitalist\nsociety here in the states,\n\n230\n00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:36.900\nso that's typically our mindset\nwhen thinking about projects.\n\n231\n00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.890\nBut it could be just anything,\nit could be social benefit.\n\n232\n00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.160\nIt could be any kind of, there's a goal\nat the end and we want to reach it and\n\n233\n00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.190\nwhat's the most effective way, how can\nwe get the biggest bang for our buck.\n\n234\n00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.510\nFor our time or our buck.\n\n235\n00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:53.080\n>> There's no doubt that this\nis the things that we probably\n\n236\n00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.070\nnaturally gravitate towards, right?\n\n237\n00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:58.890\nWe all see the big benefit in the end,\ncuz we're always justifying how much money\n\n238\n00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.480\ncomes out of the company coffers to\nmake sure that we can actually pay for\n\n239\n00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.700\nthese things, but\nis there a reason for us doing it?\n\n240\n00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.560\nAre we actually gonna outlay that and\nget what we want back?\n\n241\n00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.480\nNow as far as the cost benefit analysis\ngoes, like I said probably the most common\n\n242\n00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.870\nthat we see, but there are somethings that\nit actually doesn't account for as well.\n\n243\n00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:19.230\nSo even though it actually accounts for\nthings like gains a lot of time we may\n\n244\n00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:25.180\nfind out it may actually bring us a cost\nbenefit that we go wow this is incredible.\n\n245\n00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.710\nBut what if that particular project\nthey really doesn't line up with\n\n246\n00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:31.250\nanything that we wanna\naccomplish as a company.\n\n247\n00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.320\nWe put in place whatever we want to but\nthe very fact is\n\n248\n00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.450\na lot of times cost benefit analysis\nonly looks at the bottom dollar.\n\n249\n00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:38.620\nAnd that means some does it.\n\n250\n00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.380\nI hate being super cliche but\n\n251\n00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:45.055\nI'm gonna be cliche right now Is that,\nthe ends don't justify the means, Daniel.\n\n252\n00:13:45.055 --> 00:13:47.360\n[LAUGH] And that's what we're\ntrying to get to as well.\n\n253\n00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.160\nNow, it doesn't mean that every\ncompany does that, right?\n\n254\n00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.410\nThey don't always look\nat that bottom line.\n\n255\n00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:54.970\nYou know, some companies do go,\nlook socially we can't do it.\n\n256\n00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.940\nWe know that this will bring an outrage\nif we do something like this and\n\n257\n00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:01.800\nwe add that into our, even though it's\nsuper profitable so they may not do that.\n\n258\n00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.240\nBut there are some companies that\nwould just as soon go, I don't care,\n\n259\n00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.240\nlet me go ahead and do this, I'll\nraise the price to whatever I want to,\n\n260\n00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.730\nand have people laugh at me all the way,\nbut I'll still be bringing home the money.\n\n261\n00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:15.690\nSo you may find out it doesn't actually\naccount for whatever the strategic plan is\n\n262\n00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:19.350\nfor the overall company, doesn't fit the\ncompany, doesn't do what we need to do.\n\n263\n00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.880\nYou know cuz I've seen\nthings like this too.\n\n264\n00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.010\nNo we can start that and do this.\n\n265\n00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:27.570\nAnd we buy a piece of machinery\nthat we use one time.\n\n266\n00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:33.060\nAnd then everybody walks by it year after\nyear and they go what was that for?\n\n267\n00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.090\nIt was a project we\nworked on ten years ago.\n\n268\n00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.720\nWell why do we still have it?\n\n269\n00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.370\nBecause we worked on\na project ten years ago.\n\n270\n00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.840\nWell why is it still around?\n\n271\n00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.230\nI don't know.\n\n272\n00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.970\n>> Cuz it is.\n\n273\n00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:42.580\n>> Cuz it is.\n\n274\n00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.550\nI mean and so\nstuff like that can actually happen, so\n\n275\n00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.990\nyou may actually end up seeing that as\nprobably being one of the more common ways\n\n276\n00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.580\nthat we talk about\na project selection method.\n\n277\n00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.730\nNow the other one that I have here is\nalso what we call a scoring model.\n\n278\n00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:59.180\nScoring models tend to give a nice veneer,\n\n279\n00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.500\nI hate to say this, of that you're\nactually taking into account You know,\n\n280\n00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.730\nwhat you believe is important and you're\ngiving everybody a fair say in it okay.\n\n281\n00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:08.780\nAnd I really mean that.\n\n282\n00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:14.090\nSo you might go here's a project, here's\nhow we're actually going to score this and\n\n283\n00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:18.240\nthere may be just a group of people around\nyou and you give everybody a 1-5 scale and\n\n284\n00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.220\nyes, you have score cards and then you\njust pass them around and they score and\n\n285\n00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:26.250\nwhoever actually has the highest points\nThat's the one that ends up winning and\n\n286\n00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:27.680\nyou go alright that's cool.\n\n287\n00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.390\n>> That would never work\naround here [laughter].\n\n288\n00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:31.290\n>> It never worked.\n\n289\n00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:35.890\nSo you may actually do something\nlike a scoring model as well.\n\n290\n00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:40.130\nSo the key here though, to make it fair,\nto make it do what you need to do.\n\n291\n00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:43.240\nIs whoever is actually deciding\nthat's the problem, right.\n\n292\n00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:47.530\nIt's who is saying this is\nactually more valuable then this.\n\n293\n00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.983\nCuz you have to be able to weight\nthose answers in some way.\n\n294\n00:15:50.983 --> 00:15:53.302\nIt's not just,\nwe need this to be done, but\n\n295\n00:15:53.302 --> 00:15:57.460\nwhat is the weight of that compared to\nthis other question and why we need this?\n\n296\n00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.340\nWhoever judges that,\nwhoever says, I'm gonna add more\n\n297\n00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:04.480\nweight to this particular question than\nthis, well, they can skew that result.\n\n298\n00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.830\nSo you gotta be careful of\nwhoever's doing that as well.\n\n299\n00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:10.430\nSo, a lot of times,\nselection techniques like this,\n\n300\n00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:15.020\nit means that they're actually\nsusceptible to outside influences too.\n\n301\n00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.720\nImagine me being an actual bidder for\n\n302\n00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.790\na company contract and Daniel tells me\nwhat the waiting model is, you know?\n\n303\n00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.620\nAnd well, now I actually know.\n\n304\n00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:27.110\nHere's what I'm going to emphasize when I\ndo my presentation to all these people.\n\n305\n00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:30.580\nDaniel's already told me how\nthey're going to score on those.\n\n306\n00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.110\nSo what do I do?\n\n307\n00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:33.960\nI actually start planning\nmy presentation and And\n\n308\n00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.270\nmaking emphasize those things I know\nthat actually has the most weight.\n\n309\n00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:38.770\nAnd now all those other people,\n\n310\n00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:41.310\nwe know that Daniel didn't have\nto influence them too much.\n\n311\n00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:43.010\nI was able to actually\nprovide that influence and\n\n312\n00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.710\nnow everybody goes yeah he\ndid really well on this.\n\n313\n00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.400\n>> I thought that's how business was done,\nright?\n\n314\n00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.810\nIt's not what you know,\nit's who you know, right?\n\n315\n00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.510\n>> And that's what this is\nactually susceptible to\n\n316\n00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.370\nis something like that as well.\n\n317\n00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:55.460\nBut can it be effective?\n\n318\n00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.650\nYes, the true method behind this\nis something like what we call\n\n319\n00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:02.520\nthe Delfi technique, or\nthe Delfi model going all the way back.\n\n320\n00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.530\nBut you do actually have\nsuccessful influence here on that.\n\n321\n00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:10.450\nAnother one, of course, is right here,\nwhat we call the payback period.\n\n322\n00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.510\nPayback period is exactly\nlike it stands for here.\n\n323\n00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:18.250\nYou take what you initially laid out\nin terms of costs that you have And\n\n324\n00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:21.960\nthe actual amount of time\nit takes to pay it back.\n\n325\n00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.810\nSo that payback model might be,\n\n326\n00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:28.420\nI'm going to spend $50,000 how long is\nit going to take for your company or for\n\n327\n00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:32.930\nthis project to actually make\nthat money back so I can do that.\n\n328\n00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.070\nAnd that payback model is actually\ndependant, right because this may actually\n\n329\n00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:39.250\nconsider the very fact that there\nmay be multiple projects in life.\n\n330\n00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:42.930\nSo Daniel I may not make all my money\nback on that first project, but\n\n331\n00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:46.310\nthe second one, the third one,\nthe fourth one that you have\n\n332\n00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.940\nlined up I continue to make more money,\nmore money, more money\n\n333\n00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:53.130\nbecause I am willing to actually lay\nout the initial investment of it.\n\n334\n00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.760\nEvery time you actually come to me for\na project I just keep inching mine up.\n\n335\n00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.780\nAnd now the payback period\nmight be longer but\n\n336\n00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.630\nnow all of a sudden here it is,\nI've got more and more and\n\n337\n00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:06.450\nmore money, because you were willing\nto line up that deal for me.\n\n338\n00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:10.110\nSo this too is one of those acceptable\ninfluences, but it can be that just\n\n339\n00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.650\nstraight out that the company says we're\nwilling to outline this, we need to\n\n340\n00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:17.980\nmake sure that we make this money back in\nthree years after the project is done.\n\n341\n00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.810\nSo it may be that if you can't project, in\nother words you can't show me figures that\n\n342\n00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.180\ndo that, I go no way we're actually\ngonna do your project like this.\n\n343\n00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.870\n>> All right, well now we have\nthe last model that's up for\n\n344\n00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:32.530\nbids, which is the economic model,\nand it's kind of self-defining, right?\n\n345\n00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.560\nIt says economic model,\n\n346\n00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:38.680\nobviously has something to do with the\neconomy of whatever it is that you're in.\n\n347\n00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.610\nSo if you built cogs, it's the economy\nof cogs and how that's gonna work.\n\n348\n00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.730\nSo, Ronnie,\nexplain this in greater detail for us.\n\n349\n00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:48.230\n>> Yeah, there's a couple of\ndifferent things that go on because\n\n350\n00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.970\nof all these models and\nthe influence that they have.\n\n351\n00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:51.710\nMost of the time,\n\n352\n00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:54.880\nit may come down to some type of\naccounting that ends up being done.\n\n353\n00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.980\nAnd you hate to say that for\nbig companies this is where it lies.\n\n354\n00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.320\nThe very fact is you\nbring this project up,\n\n355\n00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.060\nyou show them the base numbers in\nterms of cost and dollars and stuff.\n\n356\n00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.360\nAnd it's not because they're influenced\nby whether or not they're going to get\n\n357\n00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.590\na greater payback or you know, the scoring\namount is going to influence, or\n\n358\n00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:14.780\nthese other people are going to get\ninto it, they do a mathematical process.\n\n359\n00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.520\nThat's what it comes down to, okay?\n\n360\n00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:19.490\nSo there's a lot of different\nmodels that are out there.\n\n361\n00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:24.150\nOne of the more common ones is what\nwe call a discounted cash flow.\n\n362\n00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.000\nThis idea is fairly simple.\n\n363\n00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.470\nWe go, all right, here's what we believe\n\n364\n00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:32.950\nthat the project's gonna end up giving\nus after we actually finish it.\n\n365\n00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.985\nFirst year, it's gonna be $100,000.\n\n366\n00:19:34.985 --> 00:19:35.760\nSecond year, 150.\n\n367\n00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.157\nThird year is gonna be $200,000.\n\n368\n00:19:39.157 --> 00:19:41.740\nWell that's actually not real, right?\n\n369\n00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.130\nSo that particular figure\nis not real at all.\n\n370\n00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:45.810\nIt's what we're projecting.\n\n371\n00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:50.950\nSo what we do instead is we day, well,\nlet's evaluate it like that today instead.\n\n372\n00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:54.140\nBecause what we believe is that the future\nis actually gonna bring us a lot more\n\n373\n00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.970\nmoney than it's worth today.\n\n374\n00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:58.700\nSo we base everything on today's dollars.\n\n375\n00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.570\nSo we might find out something that\na project that we did, let's say today,\n\n376\n00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:05.690\n10 years from now, it brought us so\nmuch money we're kind of saying,\n\n377\n00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:08.670\nwhy wouldn't we have done 10 other\nprojects like that at some point?\n\n378\n00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.850\nSo you may actually have some type of\ndiscounted cash flow if you do something\n\n379\n00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:12.830\nlike that as well.\n\n380\n00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:16.510\nNow, this does depend on you to be able\nto calculate some very economic for\n\n381\n00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:18.910\nthem and I'm not gonna go into\nthose calculations right now.\n\n382\n00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:22.150\nbut just kinda realize that this\nis one of those models too.\n\n383\n00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:26.890\nThere's also, of course, what we call the\nnet present value, is the other one too.\n\n384\n00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:31.770\nNow the net present value at this point\nsays calculates the revenue expected over\n\n385\n00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:36.300\na project's lifetime in\ntoday's dollars values.\n\n386\n00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.410\nSo you actually end up adding up all that.\n\n387\n00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:41.050\nSo just like we did in\nthe discounted cash flow.\n\n388\n00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:44.590\nWell, here they are actually saying, look,\nfor this period here you go ahead and\n\n389\n00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:45.430\nyou count up all of that and\n\n390\n00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:48.850\nthen you subtract out all the money that\nit took you during those periods as well\n\n391\n00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.330\nAnd you'll end up with a different figure,\nwhereas the first one is really a total.\n\n392\n00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:55.590\nIf I know that the overall project and\nthis kind of cash flow is going to bring\n\n393\n00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:59.360\nme a million dollars, what I believe is\na million dollars today and the future,\n\n394\n00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:03.320\nperfectly fine, this one allows me to\ndivide it up over different time periods\n\n395\n00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:07.990\nand subtract out my cost over those time\nperiods as well and project that too.\n\n396\n00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:11.060\nSo there's a lot of different\nones that you also end up doing.\n\n397\n00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:11.870\nNow on this one,\n\n398\n00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:15.660\nthis is actually a fairly clear method\nbecause it brings you a ratio, okay?\n\n399\n00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.690\nWhat the present value is\nversus the net present value.\n\n400\n00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:23.770\nAnd what you're hoping for is either\na value that is greater than zero or\n\n401\n00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:27.310\nit's actually gonna be less than zero,\ncuz you're gonna end up in a ratio, right?\n\n402\n00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:32.290\nSo if that top value, the overall\npresent value is greater let's say than\n\n403\n00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:36.020\nthe net value of it, well, you're gonna\nend up with a number greater than zero.\n\n404\n00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:36.610\nOkay?\n\n405\n00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:38.500\nWell, if you do that, that actually says,\n\n406\n00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.760\nat least mathematically,\nthis is a project that actually says what?\n\n407\n00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.940\nWe actually got more than we spent.\n\n408\n00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:44.620\nOkay?\n\n409\n00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.430\nIf you actually go the other way,\n\n410\n00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:52.100\nwhere you end up with less than zero,\nwhat you're saying is\n\n411\n00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:56.270\nwe spent a lot more than what we actually\nthought we were gonna get out of it.\n\n412\n00:21:56.270 --> 00:22:00.580\nSo you may end up with less than zero and\nthat's where you also get that too.\n\n413\n00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.360\n>> Sounds like how they do\nHollywood movies right?\n\n414\n00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:06.090\nThey say we're going to budget\n$30 million for this film and\n\n415\n00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.440\nwe should make $150 million on this film.\n\n416\n00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.130\nBut then you hear the flops right.\n\n417\n00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:14.310\nThey actually end up making less\nmoney then they spent on the film and\n\n418\n00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:15.940\nthat's the kind of model I'm seeing here.\n\n419\n00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.730\n>> Yeah, so the initial outlay, right?\n\n420\n00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:22.000\nSo if you spend that $100 million on\nthe next Kevin Costner Waterworld 2,\n\n421\n00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.272\nif you choose to do that-\n>> Shut up and take my money.\n\n422\n00:22:26.272 --> 00:22:29.460\n[LAUGH]\n>> And then you go, look, hey, here it is.\n\n423\n00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.200\nWe got 85 million out of it.\n\n424\n00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.910\nWell your net value is\nactually gonna be a lot less,\n\n425\n00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:39.550\nbecause you spent a lot more,\nthen you actually ended up taking in.\n\n426\n00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:41.740\nSo if it costs you $100 million beginning,\nbut now,\n\n427\n00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:45.440\nyou're actually saying I only\nmade $85 million off of it.\n\n428\n00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.130\nI remember Kevin Costner's\njustification on one.\n\n429\n00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:52.760\nWell now, it's actually made a lot more,\nso $115 million, that's-\n\n430\n00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.490\n>> It was the long bet.\n\n431\n00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:56.047\n>> Yeah.\nBut now, 15 years later or\n\n432\n00:22:56.047 --> 00:22:59.780\nwhatever it was when I saw that interview,\nHe's like it's made money now, but\n\n433\n00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:03.200\nyou're like, well, but the studio needed-\n>> The time it took, yeah.\n\n434\n00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.010\n>> To get the studio to lay out\na hundred million dollars for a movie,\n\n435\n00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:08.870\nand then go, yeah, but\n25 years down the road.\n\n436\n00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:10.145\n>> You'll be raking it in.\n\n437\n00:23:10.145 --> 00:23:10.960\n>> You'll be raking it in!\n\n438\n00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.950\nIt's probably a great investment as long\nas you didn't need the hundred million for\n\n439\n00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:15.990\nother\n>> Projects.\n\n440\n00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.770\n>> Right.\n\n441\n00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:20.410\n>> Yes, so you may also end up\nseeing something like that as well.\n\n442\n00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:23.420\nthere's also what we call,\nthe internal rate of return.\n\n443\n00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.830\nNow, this is actually on what we call,\nprofitability, okay?\n\n444\n00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.810\nOn the investment as a percentage.\n\n445\n00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:30.600\nNow, what the heck does that mean?\n\n446\n00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.330\nWell, a lot of times,\nwhen a company makes a profit, right?\n\n447\n00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:35.900\nWhat we wanna do is, we don't just say,\n\n448\n00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.020\nall right,\nall that money is ours right now.\n\n449\n00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:40.220\nWe wanna actually say, hey,\nhere's how it actually took.\n\n450\n00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.130\nHere's the distribution over time.\n\n451\n00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.104\nSo you end up showing that profitability\nas a percentage over that year.\n\n452\n00:23:45.104 --> 00:23:47.556\nIf you say that you have\nannual profitability,\n\n453\n00:23:47.556 --> 00:23:50.927\nyou divide that by 12 as a percentage and\nthen you actually say,\n\n454\n00:23:50.927 --> 00:23:55.033\nhere's how much money we made during that\nyear, and each particular quarter or\n\n455\n00:23:55.033 --> 00:23:59.080\neach month you actually show that So\nyou don't actually take the full thing and\n\n456\n00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:03.346\ngo all right, here's my million dollars\nand I'm gonna count that all right now.\n\n457\n00:24:03.346 --> 00:24:05.460\nBut it's the internal rate\nof return that you have.\n\n458\n00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:09.056\nNow, are all these actually economic\nformulas that work in investing and\n\n459\n00:24:09.056 --> 00:24:10.970\nthe things that we were talking about?\n\n460\n00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:12.060\nYes, okay.\n\n461\n00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.510\nAre they things that your accounting\ndepartment can do easily?\n\n462\n00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:16.650\nProbably, okay.\n\n463\n00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:19.950\nAre these things that\nRonnie Wong can do in his head?\n\n464\n00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:24.510\nNo, when it comes down to it, no, there's\nno way that I'm actually smart enough to\n\n465\n00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:27.120\ntake every single little thing and\nremember all those formulas.\n\n466\n00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.490\nBut just kinda realize that\nthere are times, right.\n\n467\n00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:33.603\nSo it's not just about the idea here\nthat there is a benefit analysis,\n\n468\n00:24:33.603 --> 00:24:37.590\nscoring model, payback period,\neconomic, they're all there.\n\n469\n00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:41.024\nBut in a large company it might just\ncome down that where you go, all right,\n\n470\n00:24:41.024 --> 00:24:43.531\nlet me submit this all to\nthe accounting department and\n\n471\n00:24:43.531 --> 00:24:46.580\nthey'll tell me whether or\nnot I actually can select this.\n\n472\n00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.980\nAnd so you might select four different\nprojects and go, accounting,\n\n473\n00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.780\nrun through it, and let them do it.\n\n474\n00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:54.690\nAnd depending on what\nthe strategic plan is for\n\n475\n00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:57.490\nthe company, they'll pick whatever\nmodel that they normally go with.\n\n476\n00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.180\n>> That's right, and they're very\ngood at it so let them do their job.\n\n477\n00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:04.246\n[LAUGH] They surely didn't hire me to\ndo accounting, or any type of math,\n\n478\n00:25:04.246 --> 00:25:06.054\nI'm horrible in math so [LAUGH].\n\n479\n00:25:06.054 --> 00:25:07.515\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'd love to leave it to them.\n\n480\n00:25:07.515 --> 00:25:10.355\nNow, Ronnie, are there any other types of\ndecision models that we might run into?\n\n481\n00:25:10.355 --> 00:25:12.319\n>> There's a couple of them and\nwe're just gonna mention them,\n\n482\n00:25:12.319 --> 00:25:14.263\nand kinda mention names, but\nwe're not gonna go over them.\n\n483\n00:25:14.263 --> 00:25:18.515\nAnd the reason why is most of us are not\ngonna ever do anything like this.\n\n484\n00:25:18.515 --> 00:25:21.475\nNow, there's actually even a more\ncomplex mathematical model.\n\n485\n00:25:21.475 --> 00:25:24.365\nIt comes into what we would call\nconstraint optimization, and\n\n486\n00:25:24.365 --> 00:25:28.140\nI do have it right here on my board here,\nokay?\n\n487\n00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.260\nNow this is where you\nactually add in statistics\n\n488\n00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.920\nas well as mathematics to do it.\n\n489\n00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.210\nAnd then when you do something like that,\n\n490\n00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:35.580\nI wrote this down cuz I couldn't\nremember it here, okay?\n\n491\n00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:40.320\nYou end up with theoretical microeconomic\nnon-linear cost volume profit models.\n\n492\n00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.387\n>> Well yeah, I mean, duh.\n\n493\n00:25:42.387 --> 00:25:43.644\n[LAUGH]\n>> I mean,\n\n494\n00:25:43.644 --> 00:25:46.804\nwho would not have ever come up with that?\n\n495\n00:25:46.804 --> 00:25:48.945\nYeah cuz I thought,\nI can remember, no I can't,\n\n496\n00:25:48.945 --> 00:25:50.762\nI can't even remember\nthe name of that one.\n\n497\n00:25:50.762 --> 00:25:54.177\nBut you can understand why I would\navoid this one like the plague,\n\n498\n00:25:54.177 --> 00:25:55.803\nthat's what it comes down to.\n\n499\n00:25:55.803 --> 00:25:59.048\nAnd then of course, the other one, right,\n\n500\n00:25:59.048 --> 00:26:02.138\nis just as rolling off\nthe tongue as it is.\n\n501\n00:26:02.138 --> 00:26:05.370\nEconomic order of quantity and\neconomic batch size models, okay.\n\n502\n00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:09.430\nAnd, of course,\nthe quantity cost conformance models.\n\n503\n00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:12.610\nOnce again,\nthis is probably more mathematical.\n\n504\n00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:16.160\nThis is probably for the person that\nactually does that MBA business analysis\n\n505\n00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.980\nand business calculus stuff\nthat I don't know how to do.\n\n506\n00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.170\nThat's what it comes down to.\n\n507\n00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:21.630\nSo you can actually use that.\n\n508\n00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:24.940\nAnd lastly, there's also expert judgement,\na lot of times we rely on this.\n\n509\n00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.750\nSomebody's actually good at whatever\nproject we think that they are on.\n\n510\n00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:31.168\nThey could say no, I couldn't get that\ndone for a quarter million dollars.\n\n511\n00:26:31.168 --> 00:26:35.350\nWell, they're experience,\ntheir ability to handle this stuff,\n\n512\n00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.790\nthey probably can give you a good\nball park figure on whether or\n\n513\n00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:39.920\nnot you would actually\nselect something like this.\n\n514\n00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.060\nSo it's very possible that you may\nactually still end up seeing this as well.\n\n515\n00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:47.040\n>> This all comes back down to\nthe guy that has done this for years.\n\n516\n00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:52.310\nHe's got experience and expertise and\nthat's why we call it expert judgement.\n\n517\n00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.390\nAnybody that's done anything for\na sufficient amount of time and\n\n518\n00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:55.650\nhas been successful at it,\n\n519\n00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:59.750\nyou probably want to listen to what they\nhave to say when it comes to that subject.\n\n520\n00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:03.880\nAnd if you can have them in on your team,\nleaning on them heavily is something\n\n521\n00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.910\nyou'll probably do,\nbecause it's a very good idea.\n\n522\n00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:09.700\nThey will help you make\nthe right decisions\n\n523\n00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.180\nbecause they've been there,\nthey've done it.\n\n524\n00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:12.060\nThey see what works and\n\n525\n00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:16.710\nthey've seen what doesn't work, and\nthat's why they call it expert judgment.\n\n526\n00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:19.770\nYou can lean on them even\nthough you're the manager,\n\n527\n00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:21.560\nthe ultimate decision falls on you.\n\n528\n00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.328\nSo they might make the wrong decision,\nit's possible.\n\n529\n00:27:24.328 --> 00:27:27.390\nAnd you're gonna have to\ntake the hit if they do.\n\n530\n00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:31.310\nBut, you probably are making a very safe\nbet with someone that has done this for\n\n531\n00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:32.450\na very long time.\n\n532\n00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:36.185\n>> There really is, expert judgment is\na big part of doing project management.\n\n533\n00:27:36.185 --> 00:27:38.520\nThere's no way to get around it, right.\n\n534\n00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.700\nWhy are you gonna try and reinvent\nthe wheel when you know someone that\n\n535\n00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:46.340\nmay have done a similar project, already\nhas experience in guiding that project all\n\n536\n00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:49.390\nthe way through and can tell you\nwhere some of the pitfalls are.\n\n537\n00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:52.036\nYou can rely on those models to\nhelp you to do this choice and\n\n538\n00:27:52.036 --> 00:27:53.170\ndecision that you need.\n\n539\n00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:57.942\nBut if you know someone that absolutely\nsays, yes, your company can handle this,\n\n540\n00:27:57.942 --> 00:28:01.870\nor no it can't, that's the person\nyou really want to rely on.\n\n541\n00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:04.230\nSo the selection technique is a big one,\nright,\n\n542\n00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:06.850\nthat you actually go\nthrough at this point here.\n\n543\n00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:11.670\nWhether it's actually formal or informal,\nokay, whether you actually use any of\n\n544\n00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.880\nthose models at all, remember that in\na small company you're probably going to\n\n545\n00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.370\nactually end up with those that get\nmore influence from the outside or\n\n546\n00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:23.330\nfrom knowing who the person is, than if\nyou rely on those mathematical models.\n\n547\n00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:27.320\nBut, on the mathematical models, you take\na chance of actually end up saying, yeah,\n\n548\n00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.740\nany of the ones that you picked,\nRonnie, at least in handing in?\n\n549\n00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.230\nYeah, they're not gonna work for\nus at all.\n\n550\n00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:34.920\nAnd that means you have to\nstart that process over.\n\n551\n00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:39.310\nSo, you do have to actually figure out\nwhere your company's actually going to go\n\n552\n00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:44.720\nfrom this point if you're actually gonna\nbe doing some type of project selection.\n\n553\n00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.450\nSo remember, you're also not doing\nthis in a vacuum is the key.\n\n554\n00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:52.100\nYou're doing this along with the help of\nthose stakeholders that you've identified.\n\n555\n00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.820\nYou're making sure that whoever the\nproject sponsor is, whoever came up with\n\n556\n00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:59.540\nthe idea or whoever's willing to stand\nbehind you and the project manager.\n\n557\n00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:02.870\nAnd you're actually saying here's\nour best selection that we have.\n\n558\n00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:05.550\nWe just need to submit them and see if\nour company will actually be able to do\n\n559\n00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:07.690\nsomething like that in\na more formalized process.\n\n560\n00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:11.330\nIf not, you go up to the individual who's\ngonna make the decision and say yes or no,\n\n561\n00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:13.120\nand you actually know\nactually kind of immediately,\n\n562\n00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.600\ninstead of after a long process of\ntrying to do a bunch of accounting.\n\n563\n00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.976\nBut just realize that all these\nare actually part of the process and\n\n564\n00:29:19.976 --> 00:29:22.928\nit's also,\nsomething else that I realize too, Daniel,\n\n565\n00:29:22.928 --> 00:29:25.054\nis that you let me talk\nagain way too long.\n\n566\n00:29:25.054 --> 00:29:27.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, it's fun talking about this stuff.\n\n567\n00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:29.180\n>> Yeah, it is, it is.\n\n568\n00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:32.013\nAnd it's a good topic,\nespecially if you're into Project Manager,\n\n569\n00:29:32.013 --> 00:29:35.097\nyou're trying to get Project Plus because\nyou want to be a project manager.\n\n570\n00:29:35.097 --> 00:29:37.988\nThese are the kinds of things you're\ngoing to be rolling around inside\n\n571\n00:29:37.988 --> 00:29:38.679\nyour head a lot.\n\n572\n00:29:38.679 --> 00:29:40.454\nSo it's good that we\nreally vet them out so\n\n573\n00:29:40.454 --> 00:29:43.613\nI'm not really too worried a lot about\nletting you just ramble on Ronnie.\n\n574\n00:29:43.613 --> 00:29:46.649\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Go for broke, find every little nuance\n\n575\n00:29:46.649 --> 00:29:51.530\nthat'll help us be better project\nmanagers as we get on into our career.\n\n576\n00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.420\nSo Ronnie is there anything else that\nwe need to cover in this episode?\n\n577\n00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.450\n>> Not in this episode, but\n\n578\n00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:59.710\nwe still have a lot to cover in our\nproject, pre-project set up here.\n\n579\n00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:02.740\nAnd so, we still got a lot to go over.\n\n580\n00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.625\nSo I think we're gonna have to extend\nthis to another episode, Daniel.\n\n581\n00:30:04.625 --> 00:30:06.679\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, I'm looking forward to that,\n\n582\n00:30:06.679 --> 00:30:07.410\nhopefully you are as well.\n\n583\n00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:09.340\nHopefully you're getting\na lot out of this series,\n\n584\n00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:11.210\nthat's what we're trying to accomplish.\n\n585\n00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:12.630\nThat's our project, right Ronnie?\n\n586\n00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:13.260\n>> It is.\n\n587\n00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:16.330\n>> So, that being said, we're gonna go\nahead and call it a day for this episode.\n\n588\n00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:17.740\nHopefully we'll see you in the next.\n\n589\n00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.490\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n590\n00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:21.200\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n591\n00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.150\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n592\n00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:30.660\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.140\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.600\nthat's right we are continuing\non with our Project+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.126\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nfor a part three is our good friend, Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:27.126 --> 00:00:27.770\nRonnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:28.860\nRonnie, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.410\n>> Well thank you again for having me.\n\n9\n00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.050\nAs we continue on taking a look here at,\nof course,\n\n10\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.990\nCompTIA's Project+,\nwe wanna make sure that we understand,\n\n11\n00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.280\nthat as we continue on, right,\nthat we're only in the initiation phase.\n\n12\n00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.020\nSo we've gone through a bit when we talk\nabout initiation and pre-project setup.\n\n13\n00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.120\nAnd now we're continuing on, and\nhopefully finish this one up as well for\n\n14\n00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.420\nus, as we take a look.\n\n15\n00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.980\nSo in previous episodes, right,\nwe went ahead and we took a look at,\n\n16\n00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.870\nof course the beginnings here.\n\n17\n00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.460\nMaking sure that we understand what\na project is as far as identifying it for\n\n18\n00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.990\nwhat we need.\n\n19\n00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.000\nWe validated the overall project.\n\n20\n00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.220\nWe took a look at project\nselection techniques, and\n\n21\n00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.820\nthat's kind of where we ended\nthe last episode that we had.\n\n22\n00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.340\nSo if you're picking up now and\nyou're going wow,\n\n23\n00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.230\nhe's kind of jumping in the middle\nof things, make sure you go back and\n\n24\n00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.840\ncheck out those other episodes\nthat we had before this point.\n\n25\n00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.590\nAs we continue on tinkering we've\ngot some of things that we have.\n\n26\n00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.450\nRemember that before we spend\na single dime on our project,\n\n27\n00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.860\nbefore we assign any resource,\n\n28\n00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.205\nbefore we do any of that, I wanna make\nsure that we have a good project,\n\n29\n00:01:27.205 --> 00:01:31.890\npre-project, plan setup so that we know\nwhat is actually gonna end up happening.\n\n30\n00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.540\nNow, after we get in line, right.\n\n31\n00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.530\nIn other words,\nafter we line up everything else.\n\n32\n00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.270\nWe've now selected our project.\n\n33\n00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.800\nOkay, we've got everything that we need.\n\n34\n00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.450\nThe thing that we have\nas a project manager or\n\n35\n00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.780\nI shouldn't say the thing that we have.\n\n36\n00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.870\nThe thing that we don't\nhave as a project manager,\n\n37\n00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.080\nI think is more apt here,\nis what we call approval or authorization.\n\n38\n00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.900\nOkay, so this is something that's\nactually kind of a conundrum for\n\n39\n00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.610\nmost project managers.\n\n40\n00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.413\nIf you're brought in from the outside,\nlet's say that you work for\n\n41\n00:02:00.413 --> 00:02:03.680\na project management group and\nyou're brought in from the outside.\n\n42\n00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.870\nIt doesn't mean that once the company says\nhere's a project I need you to work on,\n\n43\n00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.420\nit doesn't mean that you\njust get to go ahead,\n\n44\n00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.190\nall right, I'm ready to go and start.\n\n45\n00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.090\nI know that that sounds strange.\n\n46\n00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.460\nBut it's true there's not a lot of\ntimes he can actually able to do that.\n\n47\n00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.400\nAnd that's because in project management\nthere's a process we have to have\n\n48\n00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.420\nwhich says that you are authorized\nto start here, okay.\n\n49\n00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.870\nAnd this is only that you as a project\nmanager may have actually end up doing\n\n50\n00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.850\nwhich is what we call of course, preparing\nwhat we call the project charter, okay.\n\n51\n00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.790\nNow when it comes down to\nthe project charter itself,\n\n52\n00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.140\nit is the official documentation\nthat we have, okay.\n\n53\n00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.800\nThat says that the project can now exist.\n\n54\n00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.190\nI know that's strange,\nyou're going, well we selected it.\n\n55\n00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.730\nBut now you're actually formally\nallowing people to say hey,\n\n56\n00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.020\nthe project now actually exists.\n\n57\n00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.470\nIt has backing behind it and\nit has authorization.\n\n58\n00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.810\nAll right, so now that we have this,\nright, we have a document that says that\n\n59\n00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.690\nwe are authorized to be\nable to use resources here.\n\n60\n00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.820\nAnd that's what I put,\nauthorizes the release and\n\n61\n00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.100\nuse of organizational resources.\n\n62\n00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.500\nNow it becomes something on\nthe actual organization's radar,\n\n63\n00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.160\nmore than anything else, right.\n\n64\n00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.130\nUp to this point we've been talking,\nwe've been negotiating a little bit.\n\n65\n00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.150\nWe've tried to get project sponsors, or\nnot sponsors, stakeholders on our side.\n\n66\n00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.910\nWe've tried to make sure that\nwe've covered all of our bases.\n\n67\n00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.110\nBut getting a project charter is\nsomething that is very important.\n\n68\n00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.170\nYou can go through this entire\nprocess believe it or not, Daniel.\n\n69\n00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.670\nGet everything in line.\n\n70\n00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.960\nProve that it's actually a great project.\n\n71\n00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.750\nDo the cost-benefit analysis.\n\n72\n00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.340\nWe know it's gonna work.\n\n73\n00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.210\nBut, somebody doesn't sign off\non that in your organization,\n\n74\n00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.620\nthat actually says, yes you can do it.\n\n75\n00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.010\nWell you now have a great\nproject that just sits there.\n\n76\n00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.800\nAnd it just sits there.\n\n77\n00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.350\nAnd sits there.\n\n78\n00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.760\nAnd it doesn't actually get\nanywhere it needs to go.\n\n79\n00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.840\nSo in other words, your project\nreally is not going to formally exist\n\n80\n00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.070\nuntil you get this particular\ncharter here approved and\n\n81\n00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.070\nthat normally requires a formal\nsignature of some sort.\n\n82\n00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.310\nAnd that's what we actually\nhave to worry about.\n\n83\n00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.790\nThe key benefit though is that once\nyou have this project charter in hand,\n\n84\n00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.280\nright, is that it will actually\ngo ahead and allow you\n\n85\n00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.750\nto have what we call a well defined,\na project start and project boundary.\n\n86\n00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.320\nIn other words,\nit actually states that authorize is,\n\n87\n00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.032\nhere it is,\nwe're going to start this project, and\n\n88\n00:04:33.032 --> 00:04:36.570\nhere is actually what the limitation\nof this project is going to be.\n\n89\n00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.870\nThat way,\nthere is nobody that comes along and\n\n90\n00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.740\nsays you're not supposed to be doing that,\nyou can't do that.\n\n91\n00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.825\nYou're stepping on mine.\n\n92\n00:04:42.825 --> 00:04:45.300\nWe can actually now say\nno we've been approved.\n\n93\n00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.440\nWe have our authorized project here and we\nare ready to go forward with it as well.\n\n94\n00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.170\n>> Yeah Ronnie.\n\n95\n00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.828\nThis does tend to seem\na bit like red tape, right.\n\n96\n00:04:52.828 --> 00:04:53.554\nIn which we hate.\n\n97\n00:04:53.554 --> 00:04:57.987\nBureaucracy is the is just a killer of\nprojects because you gotta get some one to\n\n98\n00:04:57.987 --> 00:04:58.535\ndo this.\n\n99\n00:04:58.535 --> 00:04:59.580\nYou gotta get someone to do that.\n\n100\n00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.490\nIt has to be approved.\n\n101\n00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.540\nYou gotta go through these\nchannels to make sure it happens.\n\n102\n00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.090\nBut you gotta remember, and trust me,\nI'm no fan of the red-tape gun at all.\n\n103\n00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.620\nI like to just say this is what\nneeds to be done, let's just do it.\n\n104\n00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.260\nBut like Ronnie said,\n\n105\n00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.610\nwhat if I'm just doing projects cuz\nI feel like they need to be done?\n\n106\n00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.810\nI'm using company resources.\n\n107\n00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.560\nI've got no authorization\nfrom anybody who actually\n\n108\n00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.880\nhas management decisions inside\nof that company to do that.\n\n109\n00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.700\nThey're not gonna be very happy with me.\n\n110\n00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.970\nAnd you want this to save you.\n\n111\n00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.990\nThis is to also protect you as\nthe project manager to say,\n\n112\n00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.790\nI'm working well within the charter\nboundaries, cuz I can show it to you.\n\n113\n00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.800\nLook at subsection C, right here\nit says buy this type of material.\n\n114\n00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.460\nAnd if you bought that material,\nthey can't hold you accountable\n\n115\n00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.180\nif it's structurally inadequate for\nthe job that you tried to make it do.\n\n116\n00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.990\nThat's not your fault.\n\n117\n00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.260\nThat was what was told to buy,\nthat's what you bought.\n\n118\n00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.210\nIf you buy anything else, even if it's\nbetter, they can blame you for something,\n\n119\n00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.830\nor if you do anything outside of it.\n\n120\n00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.500\nSo you stay well within a very\nwell defined set of guidelines,\n\n121\n00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.630\nand that's really what\nthe charter is there for.\n\n122\n00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.750\nIt helps beyond what we know.\n\n123\n00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.830\nSo everything that Daniel said is\nabsolutely correct that the very fact is\n\n124\n00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.400\nyou've got to have something like this.\n\n125\n00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.390\nBut the other thing that it does,\nright, is now that you have that\n\n126\n00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.820\nformal project charter and\nyou have it approved and what you need.\n\n127\n00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.940\nIt now gives those functional\nmanagers inside your company\n\n128\n00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.460\nsomething that they can accept or\nthey can outright complain about.\n\n129\n00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.160\nI know that sounds strange, but\n\n130\n00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.070\nthey really can't complain about you\nif you don't have something official.\n\n131\n00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.900\nAnd you might go well that's\nthe better way to go, but\n\n132\n00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.890\nthen you don't have access to\nresources when you need them.\n\n133\n00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.790\nSo this is actually one of those\nthings that really does set\n\n134\n00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.477\ninto place in your organization\nthat your picker project can exist.\n\n135\n00:06:39.477 --> 00:06:42.690\nAnd that it maybe where other managers,\n\n136\n00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.220\neven if they're not project managers,\nneed to be able to work with you, okay.\n\n137\n00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.060\nAnd so that's something that\nhas to actually be there.\n\n138\n00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.830\nNow the key component to this\nof course is also the idea of\n\n139\n00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.780\nmaking sure we get an approval.\n\n140\n00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.580\nBut let me kinda show you\na format that can be done now.\n\n141\n00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.910\nNot every project charter that you\nhave will end up looking like this.\n\n142\n00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.940\nBut you can go out there and find some\ntemplates out there if you want to,\n\n143\n00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.980\nto do something.\n\n144\n00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.880\nSo normally what's actually\nincluded in this project charter,\n\n145\n00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.960\nright, is of course the project title.\n\n146\n00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.060\nThe sponsor, okay, who in the world\nis the sponsor at this point.\n\n147\n00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.310\nThis is the person that is gonna give\nyou the ultimate authorization, okay,\n\n148\n00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.150\nis what you actually need here.\n\n149\n00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.710\nOf who's gonna actually back\nthis particular project up and\n\n150\n00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.350\nsaying it's a good idea\nformally in the organization.\n\n151\n00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.380\nThe project manager, hopefully that's you.\n\n152\n00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:36.300\nThe customer part here can be an internal\ncustomer as well as an external customer.\n\n153\n00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.480\nRemember that if you do this,\n\n154\n00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.830\nlet's say like an example that Daniel\ngave us earlier here, the client user.\n\n155\n00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.896\nWhat is the, I can't remember.\n\n156\n00:07:45.896 --> 00:07:46.995\n>> Golly [LAUGH].\n\n157\n00:07:46.995 --> 00:07:50.120\n>> [LAUGH] The insurance one that you\nwere giving a little bit earlier.\n\n158\n00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.310\n>> The claims users, yes, the claims user.\n\n159\n00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.922\n>> Client user, I'm so\nused to IP networking.\n\n160\n00:07:53.922 --> 00:07:58.896\nThe claims users department, well it might\nnot actually be a project just for them.\n\n161\n00:07:58.896 --> 00:08:01.518\nSo you don't always have to\nhave an external customer.\n\n162\n00:08:01.518 --> 00:08:05.091\nRemember that you're looking for\nthe justification or purpose so\n\n163\n00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:10.070\nthat that's formally noted, as well as,\na general description of the project here.\n\n164\n00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.320\nThis is where we wanna make sure that\nwe do have that project start date and\n\n165\n00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.099\nthe boundaries of the project,\nas well as, doing all that.\n\n166\n00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.160\nAll the high level requirements,\nnow you may not have all of this on hand,\n\n167\n00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.450\nI mean it, okay.\n\n168\n00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.630\nNow, at this point though in\nyour planning, you should,\n\n169\n00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.110\nyou should know what you're actually\ngonna be required as you complete.\n\n170\n00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:31.666\nAnd then also take a look at the risk, so\nthere's a lot more in the idea of planning\n\n171\n00:08:31.666 --> 00:08:36.369\nhere, which is taking into a maybe a very\ngeneric and upper level risk assessment.\n\n172\n00:08:36.369 --> 00:08:39.040\nAnd saying what the requirements\nare gonna be at a very high level.\n\n173\n00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.250\nYou don't have to get very detailed and\nspecific, but\n\n174\n00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.600\njust kinda realize what you're\nactually going to accomplish here.\n\n175\n00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.710\nIs this gonna be to improve a service,\nas far as the high level requirements?\n\n176\n00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:50.960\nOr are you developing a new product?\n\n177\n00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.530\nWhatever it might be.\n\n178\n00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:56.000\nObjectives in terms of scope,\ntime, and cost.\n\n179\n00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.890\nAnd this is where we go into what\nwe call the project management\n\n180\n00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.950\ntriangle a lot of times, where these\nthings have to actually be kept in balance\n\n181\n00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.490\nif we're gonna manage\na project successfully, too.\n\n182\n00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.760\nYou may already have gone through\na bit more of the planning,\n\n183\n00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.270\nwhere you actually also\nenter in milestones.\n\n184\n00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.660\nHow you know that you're actually\naccomplishing the project itself?\n\n185\n00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.600\nNow, it doesn't mean that you\nhave to follow all of this.\n\n186\n00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.810\nThis just happens to be a template that\nI had on hand that says, you've actually\n\n187\n00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.450\ndone a lot more planning at this point\nthan what we've actually talked about.\n\n188\n00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:25.740\nEstimated budget.\n\n189\n00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.810\nThis may come from your time when you\ndid the project selection technique.\n\n190\n00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.140\nWhere your accountants went through and\n\n191\n00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:36.380\nsaid, here's how much we believe\nthe project is actually gonna cost here.\n\n192\n00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.170\nAnd at this point, you may do\nan estimated budget but remember,\n\n193\n00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.830\nthe emphasis here is estimated.\n\n194\n00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.050\nI know most of the people focus\nin on the word budget, but\n\n195\n00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.680\nyou're actually saying estimated here.\n\n196\n00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.611\nAs a project manager,\n\n197\n00:09:46.611 --> 00:09:49.680\nyou always wanna make sure you\nknow what words to emphasize here.\n\n198\n00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.100\nYou wanna emphasize the word estimate and\nthe reason why is,\n\n199\n00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.780\nyou never can tell exactly how much\na project's gonna end up costing you.\n\n200\n00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.220\nThat's due to market forces,\n\n201\n00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:01.110\ndue to people getting raises during\nthe time your project may be on hand.\n\n202\n00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.910\nIt could be that the very fact is,\n\n203\n00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:07.040\na resource that you were using might\nhave cost you $15 an hour at one point.\n\n204\n00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.880\nTwo weeks into it, all of the sudden\nbecause of some other thing that comes up.\n\n205\n00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.200\nIt's now $30 an hour for you to use that.\n\n206\n00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.770\nAnd you might end up seeing that as well.\n\n207\n00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.760\nOf course overall, stakeholders here.\n\n208\n00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.900\nLevels of authority.\n\n209\n00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.938\nNow, this is actually\nimportant in organization and\n\n210\n00:10:20.938 --> 00:10:23.396\nlater on we're gonna go through this,\nDan, a little bit more.\n\n211\n00:10:23.396 --> 00:10:27.737\nWe talk about the functional matrixes that\nwe tend to deal with in organizations, how\n\n212\n00:10:27.737 --> 00:10:32.680\nthe project manager steps in there, and\nwhat his authorization level is gonna be.\n\n213\n00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.725\nWho's actually gonna be ultimately\nresponsible for staffing decisions,\n\n214\n00:10:35.725 --> 00:10:37.570\nbudget managements, you name it.\n\n215\n00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:41.790\nBut I know that all that, okay,\nit's all negotiable, okay?\n\n216\n00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.600\nSo, any of those,\nyou can leave out, you can add in,\n\n217\n00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.060\nyou can do whatever you want to.\n\n218\n00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:50.100\nIt's whatever your organization has\nthat requires of a project charter is\n\n219\n00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.020\npretty much key.\n\n220\n00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.840\nThis one's insanely comprehensive here and\nthat's cuz we were\n\n221\n00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.960\nfairly generic when we made it, and we\ndidn't know it would be included or not.\n\n222\n00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.190\nBut you just take out the pieces you don't\nwant in there, add in the pieces you do,\n\n223\n00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:01.550\nand you're ready to go.\n\n224\n00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.610\nBut by far the most important element\nis right here at the end, okay?\n\n225\n00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:05.870\nSo in this example and\n\n226\n00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:10.080\nthis type of template here, this is\nwhat you are looking for, is right here.\n\n227\n00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:10.820\nOkay?\n\n228\n00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.970\nThis particular project charter,\nyou wanna make sure it's signed, and\n\n229\n00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:18.110\nthen turned in to essentially\nwho you need it to be.\n\n230\n00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.103\nNow, the approval for\nthis project charter here, right?\n\n231\n00:11:22.103 --> 00:11:24.168\nIs you wanna make sure\nthat it is signed and\n\n232\n00:11:24.168 --> 00:11:26.940\nthat people will recognize that signature.\n\n233\n00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.830\nI know this is something I can't do.\n\n234\n00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.180\nI cannot sign my name neatly,\nno matter what.\n\n235\n00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.020\nAnd so, this is something were you\nmay have to guide the person and say-\n\n236\n00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.140\n>> I signed your name fine, Ron.\n\n237\n00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:36.770\n>> Yeah, that's great.\n\n238\n00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:38.451\nThat's wonderful but, yeah mine.\n\n239\n00:11:38.451 --> 00:11:40.345\nNow, Daniel's handwriting\nis fairly nice and\n\n240\n00:11:40.345 --> 00:11:42.500\nyou can actually follow\nthat like a template.\n\n241\n00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:47.880\nMine, you might as well actually just kind\nof fling some ink against the paper and\n\n242\n00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.700\nrun your finger through it a couple\nof times, and you'll be ready to go.\n\n243\n00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.330\nBut you wanna make sure that people\nwill recognize the signature.\n\n244\n00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.590\nI know that sounds strange but\nit's true that they can recognize, if not,\n\n245\n00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.890\nmake sure they printed\ntheir name beside it, okay?\n\n246\n00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:01.560\nAnd date it, and that way they have it.\n\n247\n00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:06.480\nNormally, once this project charter is\nactually signed, you're not done yet.\n\n248\n00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.470\nI know that sounds strange but it's true.\n\n249\n00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.990\nYou might end up submitting\nthis to what we call a PMO,\n\n250\n00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.980\na project management office.\n\n251\n00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.610\nThat now formally accepts it as\nbeing locked in on the books.\n\n252\n00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:21.170\nAnd then notification goes out and\nonce these copies now get out to those\n\n253\n00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:25.500\ninitial managers, and\nthe date actually on it is now recognized.\n\n254\n00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.727\nIn other words, they say,\nhere it is, it's being released, and\n\n255\n00:12:28.727 --> 00:12:31.506\nall of the dates on it,\nwhen it's actually gonna start?\n\n256\n00:12:31.506 --> 00:12:35.560\nThe PMO, the project management office\nwill say, okay, it's now official.\n\n257\n00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.100\nYou can start gathering all\nthe stuff that you need to.\n\n258\n00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.669\n>> And Ronnie, they do this to keep\nthe honest man, honest, right?\n\n259\n00:12:40.669 --> 00:12:45.210\nThey become like the governing\nbody that says, well, we have.\n\n260\n00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.090\nIf I give Ronnie a copy and\nI have a copy, and I modify my copy,\n\n261\n00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:52.330\nand Ronnie modifies his copy,\nwe both go, look, my charter says this.\n\n262\n00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:53.000\nWell, who's right?\n\n263\n00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:53.690\nWell, we don't know.\n\n264\n00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.890\nWe need some third party that\nhas no stake in the game,\n\n265\n00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:01.000\nno dog in the fight, to say we're\ngonna hold onto the money here,\n\n266\n00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.740\nso when the bet gets done,\nyou know what I mean?\n\n267\n00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.102\nBut we're gonna hold on to the original\ncharter, that way, no one can modify it,\n\n268\n00:13:06.102 --> 00:13:09.057\nno one can out step their bounds\nbecause we're moderating it, right?\n\n269\n00:13:09.057 --> 00:13:10.390\nIs that the whole purpose of it?\n\n270\n00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.150\n>> It really is.\n\n271\n00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.740\nIt really helps us to guide in two ways.\n\n272\n00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.950\nOne, is exactly like the way\nthat Daniel describes it.\n\n273\n00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:16.860\nBut two, is another way.\n\n274\n00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.420\nLet me show you here, let's go back and\ntake a look at the project phases again.\n\n275\n00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.030\nOkay.\n\n276\n00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:25.550\nOnce we reach the stage where we now\nhave a formal project charter, okay.\n\n277\n00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:28.080\nThat does indicate all the things\nthat Daniel helps us to do,\n\n278\n00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.090\nwhich is to make sure that everything's\nin place that needs to be in place.\n\n279\n00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:33.040\nThere's not gonna be a dispute\nthat this is actually\n\n280\n00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.750\na real project that's going on.\n\n281\n00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:36.940\nBut secondly, once that's done,\n\n282\n00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:41.510\nyou now have taken that project\nfrom the initiation phase.\n\n283\n00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:46.460\nAnd now, that signing of the project\ncharter indicates that you are ready to\n\n284\n00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:52.550\nprogress, to move forward into\nthe planning phase, okay?\n\n285\n00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.220\nSo you cannot start planning.\n\n286\n00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.670\nI know this sounds strange,\nor you should not start.\n\n287\n00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:01.050\nYou should not start planning until\nthis is actually formally recognized and\n\n288\n00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.070\neverybody is ready to go on.\n\n289\n00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.800\nSo that particular signature,\nand now it being submitted to\n\n290\n00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.250\nwhoever's supposed to hold that project\ncharter that anybody can now refer to and\n\n291\n00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.630\nverify that everything is going on.\n\n292\n00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.360\nThat you're not ready for\nthe planning phase.\n\n293\n00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.740\nAnd so, that's all apart of\nthis overall process here.\n\n294\n00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.570\nIs that when they track\nthe entire project,\n\n295\n00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.090\nthey track it from the initiation, right?\n\n296\n00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.920\nAll the way through to the closing and\nthat way,\n\n297\n00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.040\nwhen the end of the project comes along.\n\n298\n00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.570\nThey can actually tell\nwho actually planned it.\n\n299\n00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:31.780\nWhen it came about.\n\n300\n00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.080\nHow long it took through\nall of this entire process.\n\n301\n00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.500\nAnd when did it actually formally\nstart into the planning phase?\n\n302\n00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.120\nAnd at the end of each one of these,\nwe see that.\n\n303\n00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.448\nSo the output of the initiation phase,\nokay?\n\n304\n00:14:44.448 --> 00:14:50.010\nThe goal or the producible product\nof the initiation phase here,\n\n305\n00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:51.220\nis that project chart.\n\n306\n00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.030\nThat's what's supposed\nto come out from it.\n\n307\n00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.650\nYou're not supposed to come out and\ngo, I guess we'll go to Denny's.\n\n308\n00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.290\nThat's not the idea.\n\n309\n00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.710\nThe idea is that,\nyou now have a formal thing that says,\n\n310\n00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:04.260\nyes, the beginning of this project\nis now actually able to take place.\n\n311\n00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.550\nWe have sponsors,\n\n312\n00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.730\nwe have the overall stakeholders,\nwe know what's going on here.\n\n313\n00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.830\nAnd that is actually gonna be key for\n\n314\n00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:15.660\nus when we start taking a look\nat what needs to happen.\n\n315\n00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.310\nNow, when we start to\ntake a look at that then,\n\n316\n00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.680\nonce we have that obtained here,\nwe wanna take a step back here.\n\n317\n00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.920\nAt least for the rest of this show, and\n\n318\n00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.310\njust talk about the project\nmanager's role just briefly.\n\n319\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.410\nAnd what has to happen, okay?\n\n320\n00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:35.190\nThroughout all those phases,\nthe project manager is gonna be a key\n\n321\n00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:38.160\nin the management process, okay?\n\n322\n00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.660\nBut that doesn't mean that he's\nalways gonna be in every little\n\n323\n00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.970\npiece of every part of the project.\n\n324\n00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.730\nIf he is, he's a micro manager, okay, and\n\n325\n00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.180\nthat's not what a project\nmanager needs to be.\n\n326\n00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.368\nA project manager needs to\nactually be able to step back and\n\n327\n00:15:51.368 --> 00:15:53.262\ntake a look at the entire process.\n\n328\n00:15:53.262 --> 00:15:57.590\nAs well as understand what is hindering\nthe project from getting accomplished and\n\n329\n00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.361\nwhat the project needs to\nget accomplished as well.\n\n330\n00:16:00.361 --> 00:16:04.988\nSo, when we take a look then,\nright here on my board here.\n\n331\n00:16:04.988 --> 00:16:07.321\nI wanna talk about this just briefly.\n\n332\n00:16:07.321 --> 00:16:10.896\nSo at this bigger point in time and\nwhat's actually gonna end up\n\n333\n00:16:10.896 --> 00:16:14.890\nhappening here is that the project\nmanager's role changes.\n\n334\n00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.950\nRight at the beginning he's probably\nwhat we call a project champion.\n\n335\n00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.480\nHe's the one that's trying to\nget everything pushed through.\n\n336\n00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.420\nHe's kind of the major\nmover in the background,\n\n337\n00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:26.400\ncoordinating who\nthe product sponsor is and\n\n338\n00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:30.000\nwhat are the things that need to get\ndone so I can get a project started.\n\n339\n00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.330\nSo he is the prime mover in this project.\n\n340\n00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:34.940\nHe is actually the one that's\ndoing pretty much everything.\n\n341\n00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.860\nIf Daniel is apart of this project team\nhe might not even know anything about\n\n342\n00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.120\nthis project, might not have a clue.\n\n343\n00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.040\nBut the very fact is, whoever it is, he,\n\n344\n00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.860\nat that point,\nis probably the actual one person project.\n\n345\n00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:48.930\nI know that sounds strange but\nyes, he's moving things along.\n\n346\n00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.530\nHe's getting the signature.\n\n347\n00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.010\nHe's making sure everybody understands\nwhat the requirements are, and\n\n348\n00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:54.920\nmaking sure everything has gone along.\n\n349\n00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.960\nBut at some point,\nduring this planning phase,\n\n350\n00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.330\nhe's gonna turn into somebody\nelse which is a planner.\n\n351\n00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:05.550\nHe's actually then, at that point here,\ngood at doing things like organization.\n\n352\n00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.820\nSo we can talk about the skills of\na project manager just briefly.\n\n353\n00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:10.380\nI didn't have any other place to put it.\n\n354\n00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.450\nSo it's not really in a particular\norder that I care about.\n\n355\n00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.110\nSo he needs to actually move, then, from\nthe guy that actually understands how to\n\n356\n00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:20.810\nget just a few things done,\nto being able to now be an organizer.\n\n357\n00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.560\nAnd we talked about planning, right?\n\n358\n00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.350\nWe're talking about managing resources,\nhuman as well as other resources.\n\n359\n00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:32.050\nAnd also scheduling at the same time and\nalso balancing the idea of money.\n\n360\n00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.710\nMaking sure we know where money\nis actually going to be spent.\n\n361\n00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:37.780\nSo an organizer is pretty much to key.\n\n362\n00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.770\nDuring the planning phase his problem\nsolving skills are also going to come into\n\n363\n00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.000\nplay as well.\n\n364\n00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.050\nOnce he realizes that there's\ngoing to come a point and\n\n365\n00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.720\ntime in the project where he realizes\nthat he doesn't have enough resources, or\n\n366\n00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.710\nhe's spent too much money in one area and\nnot enough in another.\n\n367\n00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:56.690\nOr that he doesn't have access to those\nresources at that particular time because\n\n368\n00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:01.010\nit's monsoon season and that ship's\nnot gonna come in during the monsoon,\n\n369\n00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.350\nwhatever it might be.\n\n370\n00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.380\nHe needs to be able to\ndo stuff like this and\n\n371\n00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.180\nto take that into hand here\nas being a project solver.\n\n372\n00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.600\nCan he get it from someone else?\n\n373\n00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.570\nNow also, of course, then, once we\nactually get through that planning phase,\n\n374\n00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.450\nhis particular skills will\nalso change once again.\n\n375\n00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.920\nAnd his role will change, too.\n\n376\n00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.210\nHe will then move in,\nduring that controlling and monitoring and\n\n377\n00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:27.580\nexecution phase, into essentially\na coach and a project manager.\n\n378\n00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:31.370\nThat he can see not only the overall\nproject itself getting done, but\n\n379\n00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.370\nhe can coach his teams when\nthings aren't getting done.\n\n380\n00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:38.500\nHe can actually be able to negotiate when\nresources are not working well together,\n\n381\n00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.600\ndoing all the things that he feels\nlike he needs to be able to do, but\n\n382\n00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.210\nhe can't accomplish in\nthe ways that he needs to do.\n\n383\n00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.506\nBut these are actually the things that end\nup happening is that you will see then\n\n384\n00:18:47.506 --> 00:18:48.820\nthat the project manager,\n\n385\n00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:53.430\nat the very beginning, you might not\neven know that he's actually out there.\n\n386\n00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:56.390\nTo the point where now,\nduring the planning phase, and\n\n387\n00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:59.236\nas you're working on the project, you\nmight find out the project manager you're\n\n388\n00:18:59.236 --> 00:19:03.760\nworking for is a genius cuz he can\njuggle all that stuff in his head and\n\n389\n00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.130\nthen put it down on paper and\nmake sure these teams work together.\n\n390\n00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:11.180\nIt's amazing the amount of technique\nthat has to be done there for\n\n391\n00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:13.010\nthem to accomplish everything\nthat's gonna happen.\n\n392\n00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.370\n>> Yeah, Ronnie, you've made a beautiful\nillustration, a great point.\n\n393\n00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.980\nI love how you have that\nhe coaches the team.\n\n394\n00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.980\nAnd you mentioned this really quickly, but\n\n395\n00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.880\nyou said you don't wanna\nbecome a micro-manager.\n\n396\n00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.090\nThis is something everybody hates.\n\n397\n00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:26.930\nNobody loves to be micromanaged.\n\n398\n00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.470\nAnd you would think that,\nsince that's common knowledge,\n\n399\n00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:32.500\nthat we wouldn't have micro-managers,\nbut they're a dime a dozen.\n\n400\n00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.080\nBecause it's typically that\nthey wanna get in the game.\n\n401\n00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.530\nThe coach doesn't run out there with\nthe quarterback and stand behind him.\n\n402\n00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:38.460\nWell just give me the ball.\n\n403\n00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.390\nI'll throw it, right.\n\n404\n00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:40.410\nThey don't do that.\n\n405\n00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.720\nThey say go do your job.\n\n406\n00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.030\nHere's how you can do it better.\n\n407\n00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:45.490\nDo you need anything from me?\n\n408\n00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:48.410\nCan I coordinate with your\noffensive line a little bit better?\n\n409\n00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.370\nAnd to make you be able to throw\nthe ball at a better time,\n\n410\n00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:55.780\nthat's his job is to see the big picture,\norchestrate what's going on, and\n\n411\n00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:59.510\nmake sure everybody has the resources they\nneed, that if anything is going wrong he\n\n412\n00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.800\ncan help them out with that, figure\nout what they would need to fix that.\n\n413\n00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.060\nThat is the role of the project manager.\n\n414\n00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.380\nI really like that\nillustration of a coach.\n\n415\n00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.120\n>> The coach is kind of\nthe big one once the execution\n\n416\n00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.590\nphase comes on hand\n>> But you also end up seeing that the key\n\n417\n00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.880\nidea behind this is that he is that\nleader for the entire project.\n\n418\n00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.260\nThe idea of leadership skills come on.\n\n419\n00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.130\nNow, you might be saying, well, Ronnie,\nwhy did you tack that on at the end.\n\n420\n00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:23.620\nBecause it's project managers, right?\n\n421\n00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.300\nIf you're actually in that point where\nyou're actually trying to see whether or\n\n422\n00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.010\nnot you will become one,\n>> it doesn't mean if you don't have all\n\n423\n00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.010\nof these skills right now that you can't,\nokay?\n\n424\n00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:34.150\nBut what it does mean, though,\nis that you do need to take time and\n\n425\n00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.160\ndevelop some of these\nskills as much as you can\n\n426\n00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.770\nif you are going to be taking on\nthe role of a project manager.\n\n427\n00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:43.900\nThe very fact is you will need\nleadership skills because\n\n428\n00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:48.600\npeople will be looking to you to do some\nof the problem solving that they can't do.\n\n429\n00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.460\nTo be able to arrange and\n\n430\n00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:55.420\nrearrange resources that they\ncan't actually do anything with.\n\n431\n00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:59.720\nThe very fact is that will actually\nrequire of you those communication skills,\n\n432\n00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.580\nproblem solving skills and that all falls\nunderneath that idea of leadership.\n\n433\n00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.450\nBeing able to know what's actually\neffective and what isn't.\n\n434\n00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.550\nAll that actually has to come\nunderneath for the project manager.\n\n435\n00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:12.950\nRemember that the goal here is to\naccomplish whatever was on that\n\n436\n00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:15.460\nproject chart that you said\nwould be accomplished.\n\n437\n00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.920\nYou can't do that if you\nare doing that micromanaging.\n\n438\n00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.745\nAnd that's why you have to be doing\nthe coaching that we talked about.\n\n439\n00:21:20.745 --> 00:21:22.320\nSo,where do you learn that stuff?\n\n440\n00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.140\nWell, you can take classes\nis pretty much the key.\n\n441\n00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.140\nYou can go to other people that\nare already in project management and\n\n442\n00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.880\nlet them know your focus and\nwhere you believe your strengths\n\n443\n00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.450\nare versus your weaknesses, and\nget advice from them as you do this.\n\n444\n00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:38.860\nSo a project manager doesn't\nalways have to be born that way.\n\n445\n00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.070\nAre there people that are like that?\n\n446\n00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.980\nYeah.\nIs Ronnie like that?\n\n447\n00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.570\nNo.\nYou just have to watch and\n\n448\n00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:44.260\nyou have to learn.\n\n449\n00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:47.420\nAnd you have to be willing to\ntake it on the chin sometimes and\n\n450\n00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.500\ngo, man that really did hit me\nin a way I didn't expect it to.\n\n451\n00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.700\nBut then you get up and you continue on.\n\n452\n00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:58.830\nSo project management is the idea of\njuggling so many different things.\n\n453\n00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.150\nBeing able to keep track of them and\nthen going,\n\n454\n00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.760\nall right, we're still gonna accomplish\nwhatever goal that we actually had here\n\n455\n00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.790\nwhile you're actually having\nto have to do all that stuff.\n\n456\n00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:10.360\nSo, that is in your future\nas a project manager.\n\n457\n00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:15.870\nBut remember, at least for initiation,\nwe've kind of covered all the basis then,\n\n458\n00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:19.240\nof what normally goes on\nduring that initiation stage.\n\n459\n00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.780\nMaking sure we have a project on hand.\n\n460\n00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:22.310\nOkay?\n\n461\n00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:26.140\nAnd not just ongoing work that we're\njust continuing on for somebody.\n\n462\n00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.620\nEnsuring that once we have that,\nthat we can validate that project,\n\n463\n00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:33.710\nmake sure our stakeholders are there, make\nsure we do have a justification for it.\n\n464\n00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.960\nThe justification shouldn't just be,\nwell, I have nothing better to do.\n\n465\n00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.180\nIt should absolutely be something\nthat your business needs or\n\n466\n00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.100\nthere's a demand for\ninside of your organization.\n\n467\n00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:48.720\nMoving on from that point, we actually go\ninto the idea of the selection techniques,\n\n468\n00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.650\nas well as understanding what the project\ncharter does and then, of course,\n\n469\n00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:55.640\nultimately, understanding\nthe role that you're gonna have.\n\n470\n00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.610\nAnd that's kind of a key element,\nis to understand your role in it.\n\n471\n00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:04.020\nIf not, we tend to slip back into\nthat functional type of person.\n\n472\n00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.410\nWe get into our groove and\nwe just hide out.\n\n473\n00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:07.840\nAnd we go, no, I can do this part well.\n\n474\n00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.860\nI don't care about dealing with the rest.\n\n475\n00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.710\nA project manager cannot do that and\nthat's what we have to realize here.\n\n476\n00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.880\nSo if you're actually ready for\nmore, there's actually gonna\n\n477\n00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:20.170\nbe more episodes coming up in which\nwe'll be going into the planning stage.\n\n478\n00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:21.450\nBut right now though, Daniel,\n\n479\n00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.930\nI think we've kind of covered\nthe initiation fairly well.\n\n480\n00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:27.360\n>> Yeah, and if I learned anything from\nthis episode, listening to you Ronny,\n\n481\n00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.850\nis that if you fail to plan,\nyou plan to fail.\n\n482\n00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:30.550\n>> That's true.\n>> So\n\n483\n00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:34.630\nyou have to put in the proper steps and\nprocedures, get everything in line and\n\n484\n00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:37.930\nmake sure that you're ready for\nwhen your projects come down the line.\n\n485\n00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.205\nAnd now we have the understanding\non how to do that.\n\n486\n00:23:40.205 --> 00:23:43.400\nRonny, thank you so much for joining us\ntoday, we appreciate your insight and\n\n487\n00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.960\nyour wisdom on these topics.\n\n488\n00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.990\nWe thank you for joining us.\n\n489\n00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.310\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for IT ProTV.\n\n490\n00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:49.830\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n491\n00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:50.490\n>> I'm Ronny Wong.\n\n492\n00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:51.430\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n493\n00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:56.735\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another\ngreat episode of IT ProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.200\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n5\n00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.370\nAnd in today's episode, well,\n\n6\n00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.710\nwe are continuing on with\nour project plus series.\n\n7\n00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.220\nJoining us back again in the studio today\nto lend his expertise on that said topic\n\n8\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.580\nis none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.560\nRonnie, welcome back to the show.\n\n10\n00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.640\nHow are you doing today, sir?\n\n11\n00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.140\n>> I appreciate being invited back,\nfirst of all, and of course,\n\n12\n00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.790\nyou are watching\nthe CompTIA Project Plus That\n\n13\n00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.000\nmeans you're interested in learning\na little more about project management.\n\n14\n00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.036\nIn a couple of previous episodes we\nactually went through the pre planning\n\n15\n00:00:44.036 --> 00:00:44.613\nstages.\n\n16\n00:00:44.613 --> 00:00:46.712\nPre setup, pre project setup,\n\n17\n00:00:46.712 --> 00:00:50.750\nthat's the way that you hear\ninside of comp ts language.\n\n18\n00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.724\nA project management inside of the pmp\nwhere you'd heard the term initiation\n\n19\n00:00:55.724 --> 00:01:00.697\nas we go through some of the different\nphases as well and what we are doing today\n\n20\n00:01:00.697 --> 00:01:05.440\nis a little unusual is that we're taking\na little more in depth look at some\n\n21\n00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.373\nof the concepts inside of that\npre project setup phase here.\n\n22\n00:01:09.373 --> 00:01:13.741\nAnd one make sure that we begin and we\nunderstand this is because fairly heavily\n\n23\n00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:17.315\ncovered on the exam that we can\nactually distinguish the ideas of\n\n24\n00:01:17.315 --> 00:01:21.300\nwhat a project actually is, and\nso that's where we want to begin.\n\n25\n00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.923\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my computer and\n\n26\n00:01:23.923 --> 00:01:28.489\nwe'll kind of review some of these things\nthat we've been talking about, all right?\n\n27\n00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:33.317\nJust about every project management course\nthat you go through lines itself with\n\n28\n00:01:33.317 --> 00:01:38.003\nwhat we call, of course, the PMBK,\nthe Project Management Book of Knowledge\n\n29\n00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:42.407\nthat's from the PMI organization, and\nthat organization is not one that\n\n30\n00:01:42.407 --> 00:01:47.379\nnecessarily says here's the rules they\nessentially say, here are some of the best\n\n31\n00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:52.370\nguidelines that we have, when we talk\nabout managing different projects.\n\n32\n00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.540\nAnd so, the way that the PMI sets it up,\nis that we go through\n\n33\n00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.980\nfive different stages, or five\ndifferent phases of project management.\n\n34\n00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.300\nAnd we take a look at the idea\nof initiation, right?\n\n35\n00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.690\nThe very beginning of a project\ndoesn't begin with spending money,\n\n36\n00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.380\ndoesn't begin with any real action.\n\n37\n00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.530\nIt begins with the idea of hey, there's\na project that might need to be done.\n\n38\n00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.310\nLet's make sure that we\nunderstand what that project is.\n\n39\n00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.160\nFrom that point, we get into specifics\nwhere we start planning for the work\n\n40\n00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.450\nto be done, and so planning is normally\nour largest stage that we take a look at.\n\n41\n00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.540\nAnd after those plans then are actually\nready to go, it's at that point we ask\n\n42\n00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.510\nyou to start to take a look at executing,\nas well as monitoring and controlling.\n\n43\n00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.140\nNow when you normally see\nthis inside of the PMBK,\n\n44\n00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.140\nyou're gonna see it as\na sequential order here.\n\n45\n00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.200\nWhere it goes initiation,\nplanning, execution, monitoring and\n\n46\n00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.900\ncontrolling, and\nthen lastly closing out a project.\n\n47\n00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.370\nEssentially ending that project as well.\n\n48\n00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.730\nBut overall though what you'll end up\nfinding out about project management\n\n49\n00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.530\nis that it's a fairly cyclical process and\n\n50\n00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.980\neverything that you do is\nreally a cyclical process here.\n\n51\n00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.620\nEven though planning normally\ndoes lead to the execution but\n\n52\n00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.860\nat the same time you're also gonna end up\ndoing monitoring as well because if not,\n\n53\n00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.750\nimagine you finishing everything\nthat you do with a project.\n\n54\n00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.520\nAnd then you go back and\nsay, now it's time for\n\n55\n00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.900\nme to go into quality control and quality\nassurance and doing all these things, and\n\n56\n00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.630\nthen realizing half the stuff\nthat you did is wrong.\n\n57\n00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.470\nSo yes, you do have these things\ngoing on simultaneously, and\n\n58\n00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.760\nalso notice these red arrows\nthat I have here too.\n\n59\n00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.520\nWhat you'll end up finding out as you\nstart executing certain things inside your\n\n60\n00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.140\nproject start monitoring and\n\n61\n00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.470\ncontrolling, you might find out that some\nof your project plan was not realistic.\n\n62\n00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.830\nI shouldn't say not realistic, was not\nexactly where you thought it would be.\n\n63\n00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.730\nAnd so that those now become\ninputs back into your project plan\n\n64\n00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.480\nthat allows you to change\nwhatever the execution is.\n\n65\n00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.800\nAnd then maybe even modify whatever that\ncontrolling aspect of it is if you need to\n\n66\n00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.630\nto help bring the project forward\ninto its ultimate conclusion.\n\n67\n00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.290\nSo ideally of course that means\nat the end of monitoring and\n\n68\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.960\ncontrolling, we now have a quality product\nand the project close out but essentially\n\n69\n00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.210\nthese things finish at the same time and\nthat's why you see this yellow arrow here.\n\n70\n00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.060\nIt's not really in existence it's just\nsomething that happens at the same time,\n\n71\n00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.180\nnow where are we right now in our series\ninside of CompTia's project plus.\n\n72\n00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.610\nWe're still taking a look\nat the initiation here and\n\n73\n00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.710\nwe're kind of deep diving\ninto that a little more.\n\n74\n00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.956\nWhere we talked about the idea\nof that pre project set up and\n\n75\n00:04:21.956 --> 00:04:26.550\nwhat we want to begin with is this\nparticular process right here\n\n76\n00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.034\nwhere we take a look at what is a project,\nokay?\n\n77\n00:04:30.034 --> 00:04:34.421\nWhat is a project and that's actually very\nimportant to everything that we actually\n\n78\n00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:36.390\nneed to understand here.\n\n79\n00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.680\nVery easy for someone, maybe new\nto the idea of project management,\n\n80\n00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.180\nto take a look at everything that they've\ndealt with as being some type of project.\n\n81\n00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.910\nAnd don't get me wrong,\nit's possible that they actually started\n\n82\n00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.290\noff in an organization in which\neverything was a project.\n\n83\n00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.820\nBut most of us though have\ncome along in organizations\n\n84\n00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.960\nin which there is a functional manager.\n\n85\n00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.220\nThere's departments, and\nwhat you essentially end up doing as you\n\n86\n00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.030\nenter into that department is that\nyou really have one supervisor.\n\n87\n00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.440\nThat particular supervisor\nalso has one supervisor.\n\n88\n00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.900\nThat supervisor probably has one\nsupervisor that he's reporting to.\n\n89\n00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.380\nAnd the work just continues\nto get done that way.\n\n90\n00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.090\nAnd then orders are handed down.\n\n91\n00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.570\nAnd then you end up with\nactually fulfilling that order.\n\n92\n00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.010\nAnd then again, you report to\nwhoever's actually above you.\n\n93\n00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.620\nAnd that works, and\nthat's the way that certain things are.\n\n94\n00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.880\nBut the fact is that's actually different\nthan the work of what we talk about inside\n\n95\n00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.080\nof our project.\n\n96\n00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.630\nSo the most basic sentence definition\nof what our project really is,\n\n97\n00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.070\nbegins right here.\n\n98\n00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:43.470\nA temporary endeavor undertaken to create\na unique product, service, or result.\n\n99\n00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.990\nNow I'm keying in on the term unique here,\nokay?\n\n100\n00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.000\nAnd the key is that idea is that\nwhatever is actually resulted\n\n101\n00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.280\nfrom the idea of this project is\nsomething that is actually unique.\n\n102\n00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.230\nBut it doesn't mean that we also avoid the\nrest of this sentence definition that we\n\n103\n00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.920\nhave here too, we also need to key in on\nthe terms, of course, temporary endeavor.\n\n104\n00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.060\nAs well as the idea of\ncreating that unique project.\n\n105\n00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.330\nSo when we talk about the ideas here,\n\n106\n00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.090\nI want to actually give three examples,\nokay?\n\n107\n00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.200\nBecause of the way that it describes\nhere as being a unique product,\n\n108\n00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.030\na unique service, or\neven some type of unique result.\n\n109\n00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.700\nSo the first one that I thought\nabout is the idea of a product,\n\n110\n00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.890\nthat's also came from the result\nof a project as well.\n\n111\n00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.720\nWhich is something like men's razors.\n\n112\n00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.620\nNow don't get me wrong, I've been\nshaving the hell out in less than 25,\n\n113\n00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.350\n30 years now at least.\n\n114\n00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.380\nI'm going to say 30 plus years now.\n\n115\n00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.130\nAnd razors have actually undergone\nchanges during those 30 years.\n\n116\n00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.611\n>> I'm not familiar with this\nterm razors and shaving.\n\n117\n00:06:47.611 --> 00:06:49.120\n[LAUGH]\n>> [CROSSTALK] You might\n\n118\n00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.705\nactually think that I'm not\nfamiliar with it either,\n\n119\n00:06:51.705 --> 00:06:55.486\nbut I shave around the outside, I don't\nreally tend to shave too much any more.\n\n120\n00:06:55.486 --> 00:06:57.222\nBut I did shave for a long time and\n\n121\n00:06:57.222 --> 00:06:59.960\nI remember the first time that I started,\nright?\n\n122\n00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.320\nIt was just at single razor, disposable\nrazors had really just come on the scene.\n\n123\n00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.080\nSo it's a little white thing with a little\nyellow, cover over it and it's still\n\n124\n00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.780\nfelt like that single razor blade that\nI remember my dad actually using, okay?\n\n125\n00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.050\n>> But over the years though now they\nstart adding a double, or twin blades,\n\n126\n00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.580\ntriple blades, I'm going to assume\nDaniel that you are a modern man, you\n\n127\n00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.650\nare a man on the cutting edge, I'm going\nto say you're a five razor blade guy.\n\n128\n00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.050\n>> I use a straight edge.\n\n129\n00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.038\n>> Strate edge [CROSSTALK] with a spoon.\n\n130\n00:07:32.038 --> 00:07:35.753\nSo, he's going backward in time,\nmaybe I didn't pick the best example but\n\n131\n00:07:35.753 --> 00:07:37.080\nmost of us, right?\n\n132\n00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.060\nWe've actually come up and\nwhat ends up happening is that more and\n\n133\n00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.620\nmore razors got added in.\n\n134\n00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.100\nWell what is that about?\n\n135\n00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.131\nIt's not that the razor has changed it\nstill does the same functional thing so\n\n136\n00:07:47.131 --> 00:07:50.992\nwhy in the world would I list men's\nrazors here as being a unique product.\n\n137\n00:07:50.992 --> 00:07:54.812\nWell it's because the addition of those\nrazors, at least according to what I\n\n138\n00:07:54.812 --> 00:07:58.946\nunderstand from the commercials here,\nis that it gives you a close shave, right?\n\n139\n00:07:58.946 --> 00:08:03.076\nIt trims the hair even further\ndown than it needs to, and.\n\n140\n00:08:03.076 --> 00:08:05.562\nSo that you actually get a very nice,\nclose shave.\n\n141\n00:08:05.562 --> 00:08:09.392\nWell, somebody said that the original\nrazor essentially didn't perform the way\n\n142\n00:08:09.392 --> 00:08:13.070\nthat it needed to, and so they actually\nsaid well, how can we improve on that?\n\n143\n00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.044\nAnd so they started coming with a twin\nblade and the five blade, you name it.\n\n144\n00:08:17.044 --> 00:08:21.874\nThat actually is an improvement upon\nan original product that actually started\n\n145\n00:08:21.874 --> 00:08:23.034\nout as that razor.\n\n146\n00:08:23.034 --> 00:08:25.677\nAnd then, after you think\nabout the original ones and\n\n147\n00:08:25.677 --> 00:08:29.273\nthen the disposable ones here,\nthat was an improvement product again.\n\n148\n00:08:29.273 --> 00:08:31.915\nSo it wasn't that it didn't exist before,\nbut\n\n149\n00:08:31.915 --> 00:08:34.888\nif you actually bring\nan improvement to the product,\n\n150\n00:08:34.888 --> 00:08:39.330\nto now where people have actually gotten\nrid of the straight blade, [LAUGH] one.\n\n151\n00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.573\nSecondly, the old razor that you used\nto unscrew, and it would flip open and\n\n152\n00:08:43.573 --> 00:08:47.904\nyou could pull the razors out here,\nwell, that's a unique product, okay?\n\n153\n00:08:47.904 --> 00:08:51.302\n>> So this is the idea of building\nthe better mouse trap kind of idea, right?\n\n154\n00:08:51.302 --> 00:08:53.026\nYou got a mousetrap that works fine, but\n\n155\n00:08:53.026 --> 00:08:55.117\nthere's always improvements\nthat can be made.\n\n156\n00:08:55.117 --> 00:08:58.276\nAnd if you can make an improvement then\nit's gonna be a better product, and\n\n157\n00:08:58.276 --> 00:09:00.583\ntherefore, if you're in\nthe business to make money,\n\n158\n00:09:00.583 --> 00:09:02.056\nyou now have that better product.\n\n159\n00:09:02.056 --> 00:09:02.947\nLike Ronnie says,\n\n160\n00:09:02.947 --> 00:09:06.690\nwe went from one bladed razors, well,\na company comes out I do two blades.\n\n161\n00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:07.232\n>> Yeah.\n>> And\n\n162\n00:09:07.232 --> 00:09:09.010\nit shaves better than the one blade.\n\n163\n00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.226\nDon't buy them, buy us.\n\n164\n00:09:10.226 --> 00:09:11.719\nAnd they figured out how\nto make that work, and\n\n165\n00:09:11.719 --> 00:09:13.151\nthat was all through the project planning.\n\n166\n00:09:13.151 --> 00:09:14.537\n>> Yeah, there's no doubt,\n\n167\n00:09:14.537 --> 00:09:18.640\nbecause you take a look at the surface\narea of those razor blades, right?\n\n168\n00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.070\nWell, now people can get five razors in\nthe same area that they used to be able to\n\n169\n00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.690\nget two razors.\n\n170\n00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.660\nWell, if you think about it,\nthink about how thin that metal has to be,\n\n171\n00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.805\nand that there comes a point in that\nthinness where it has to break.\n\n172\n00:09:29.805 --> 00:09:33.280\nSo there was some particular\nidea behind this,\n\n173\n00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.460\nthat it could be done,\nand so that they did.\n\n174\n00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.330\nThey created a unique product\nwith just something like that.\n\n175\n00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:39.800\nNow, what about the idea of a service?\n\n176\n00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.900\nWell, what I have listed\nhere is pizza delivery.\n\n177\n00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.110\nNow, I know Daniel,\nyou like pizza, I'm assuming?\n\n178\n00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:47.300\nI like pizza.\n\n179\n00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.140\n>> Awesome,\npizza is one of the best things on Earth.\n\n180\n00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.010\n>> It is great.\n\n181\n00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:56.000\nAnd I am gonna assume you've had pizza\nevery place you ever flown, ever been?\n\n182\n00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.680\n>> Amen.\n\n183\n00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.540\n>> Me too, okay?\n\n184\n00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.700\nSo it's not that the pizza is unique,\nbut at one point in time, guess what?\n\n185\n00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.520\nYou couldn't actually have\npizza delivered to your home.\n\n186\n00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.520\nIt just didn't happen, okay?\n\n187\n00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.650\nSo somebody came up with the idea.\n\n188\n00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.570\nI'm not gonna say it was the Domino's guy,\ncuz it could have been, but\n\n189\n00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.450\nit could have been somebody else for\nall I know.\n\n190\n00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:14.490\nBut somebody said,\n\n191\n00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:19.690\nlook, what I wanna do is I wanna\nbuild an entire pizza business behind\n\n192\n00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:23.450\nthe actual service here of actually being\nable to deliver it to people's homes.\n\n193\n00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:28.250\nSo, somebody came up with that product\nidea that became a service, and\n\n194\n00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:29.750\nnow they're essentially doing that.\n\n195\n00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.160\nAnd if you actually go into\nthe realm of Domino's and\n\n196\n00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.200\nyou look at their product development,\n\n197\n00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.840\nthey tell you that their product is not\nthe pizza, their product is delivery.\n\n198\n00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.790\nAnd so that was a project that they\ncame up with that they realized\n\n199\n00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:44.460\nthat it's not that they can't, don't get\nme wrong, they make good pizzas, but\n\n200\n00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.910\nit's not that they can't make pizzas,\nit's not that they don't make pizzas,\n\n201\n00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.510\nit's that their real product is\nthat they can get it to your home.\n\n202\n00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:54.060\nAnd at one time in the early days it was\n30 minutes or less, or it would be free.\n\n203\n00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.080\nSo you could actually even\nsee something like that.\n\n204\n00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.230\nSo that is a project that was undertaken,\nand it now results in this particular\n\n205\n00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.990\nservice here that was unique that may\nnot have actually existed before.\n\n206\n00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.370\nPeople will also, again,\ncontinue to improve on that.\n\n207\n00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:07.910\nNow they not only deliver pizza.\n\n208\n00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.620\nChinese food, you name it.\n\n209\n00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.613\nEverybody has taken off in that market and\nbeen doing that too.\n\n210\n00:11:12.613 --> 00:11:16.971\n>> Delivery as a service even, just get\nanything delivered, to be honest with you.\n\n211\n00:11:16.971 --> 00:11:19.940\nThere's plenty of places inside of,\nwe live here in Gainesville, Florida.\n\n212\n00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:22.802\nThey just have Gator Delivery,\nor whatever it is.\n\n213\n00:11:22.802 --> 00:11:25.670\nYou can say pick me up some McDonald's,\nand they'll deliver it to you.\n\n214\n00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.380\nAnd you tip the driver and\nyou're off to the races.\n\n215\n00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.600\n>> That is right.\n\n216\n00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.720\nAnd the last one I had, of course,\nis just a unique result.\n\n217\n00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.546\nRight now at ITProTV Studios,\n\n218\n00:11:33.546 --> 00:11:38.300\nwe are in this process where we're\ntalking about moving to new studios.\n\n219\n00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.215\nWell, the very fact is,\nif the studios aren't done yet,\n\n220\n00:11:41.215 --> 00:11:43.131\nthe move itself is inconsequential.\n\n221\n00:11:43.131 --> 00:11:46.790\nSo, what we're actually hoping for,\nof course, is at the end of the project,\n\n222\n00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.194\nwhere we're actually gonna\nbuild out our studios,\n\n223\n00:11:49.194 --> 00:11:51.231\nto do what we want is\nthat we end up with what?\n\n224\n00:11:51.231 --> 00:11:55.540\nA unique product,\nwhich is gonna be new studios for us too.\n\n225\n00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.253\nSo notice that each one of these is\nactually different products, but\n\n226\n00:11:58.253 --> 00:12:00.094\nthey're driven by\ndifferent things as well.\n\n227\n00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:03.397\nOne is by a business demand,\nsuch as the razor, okay?\n\n228\n00:12:03.397 --> 00:12:08.452\nThe very fact is the market said look,\nI like that single Bic razor,\n\n229\n00:12:08.452 --> 00:12:12.100\nwhatever it might be,\nI like that single blade.\n\n230\n00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.360\nBut I really still feel that it's not\nactually as close as it could be.\n\n231\n00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.310\nSomebody came out with a new product.\n\n232\n00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.620\nBusiness demand, somebody needed it,\nit actually ended up happening.\n\n233\n00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:25.764\nSomebody sitting at home one night said\nI'd love to have a pizza tonight, but\n\n234\n00:12:25.764 --> 00:12:27.440\nI don't really want to go out.\n\n235\n00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.962\nAgain, another business demand that was\nmade, somebody was able to take a look at\n\n236\n00:12:30.962 --> 00:12:34.347\nthat and be able to see that and say look,\nI can come up with a service to do that.\n\n237\n00:12:34.347 --> 00:12:37.646\nAnd then sometimes it's\njust an internal need.\n\n238\n00:12:37.646 --> 00:12:41.251\nThe very fact is ITproTV Studios is\nactually continuing to grow, and\n\n239\n00:12:41.251 --> 00:12:44.010\nthat means we want to\nproduce more content.\n\n240\n00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.040\nThat means we need actual studio space.\n\n241\n00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.280\nAnd in our current space,\n\n242\n00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.520\nwe just don't have enough ability\nto have more studios that we need.\n\n243\n00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.810\nSo we needed another plan.\n\n244\n00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.070\nSo, you will see different ways and\n\n245\n00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:58.920\nwhat drives the idea of\ndifferent projects, as well.\n\n246\n00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.414\nSo just kind of be able to understand\nthat the whole goal is to understand what\n\n247\n00:13:03.414 --> 00:13:04.477\nthat project is.\n\n248\n00:13:04.477 --> 00:13:08.648\nBecause it's very easy for any company\nto come up with just work to do, and\n\n249\n00:13:08.648 --> 00:13:10.146\nthen to call it a project.\n\n250\n00:13:10.146 --> 00:13:13.670\nAnd it's not necessarily the idea\nof what a project actually is.\n\n251\n00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:17.451\nSo that means we need to be able to\ndistinguish that as what has to happen.\n\n252\n00:13:17.451 --> 00:13:19.441\n>> Now Ronnie,\nobviously we're getting ideas.\n\n253\n00:13:19.441 --> 00:13:24.253\nI think you've done a really good job of\nactually helping us understand what does\n\n254\n00:13:24.253 --> 00:13:28.656\nCompTIA, or just project management\nin general, say what a project is.\n\n255\n00:13:28.656 --> 00:13:31.975\nThat's what we're trying\nto do is define a project,\n\n256\n00:13:31.975 --> 00:13:34.493\nwhich is a temporary endeavor, right?\n\n257\n00:13:34.493 --> 00:13:37.202\nWhich comes up with a result,\na unique result, or\n\n258\n00:13:37.202 --> 00:13:40.350\na product of something like that,\nor a service.\n\n259\n00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:44.530\nBut why are we so\ninvested in trying to figure that out?\n\n260\n00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:49.950\nIs there something that's, would I ever\nget that mistaken for something else?\n\n261\n00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:50.635\n>> Well, you can.\n\n262\n00:13:50.635 --> 00:13:54.395\n[COUGH] The very fact is, you may actually\nget it mistaken for something else, and\n\n263\n00:13:54.395 --> 00:13:56.991\nthat is because there's work\nthat goes on in a project,\n\n264\n00:13:56.991 --> 00:13:59.280\nthere's work that goes on in your work.\n\n265\n00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.270\nWell, what makes the difference here?\n\n266\n00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.923\nWhen we talk about that,\nwe normally distinguish it,\n\n267\n00:14:03.923 --> 00:14:06.070\nand I use the term ongoing work here.\n\n268\n00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.840\nSo you may hear the term functionality,\n\n269\n00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.060\nyou may hear the term organizational work,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n270\n00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.840\nBut it's actually the idea of\nwhat we call ongoing work.\n\n271\n00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.250\nAnd that means that effort\nactually is required for\n\n272\n00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:21.080\nthat particular entity to be in\nexistence and constantly going on.\n\n273\n00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.230\nNow, let me put it this way, right?\n\n274\n00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.160\nWhen you actually go to work every day,\nyou're supporting an organization.\n\n275\n00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.880\nYou're not necessarily building\nthat exact product like the razors,\n\n276\n00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.910\nyou could be someone doing that, but the\nvery fact is you're actually part of that\n\n277\n00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:40.380\nongoing effort to make sure more and more\nrazors get actually produced and get done.\n\n278\n00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.890\nSo ongoing work is one of those things\nthat can require what we call some type of\n\n279\n00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:49.060\nrepetitive task, and ends up following\nexisting procedures at the same time.\n\n280\n00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.860\nAnd that's what have to actually\nunderstand the difference about,\n\n281\n00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.380\nas well,\nbecause we cannot just take a project and\n\n282\n00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.300\nturn it into ongoing work\njust because we choose to.\n\n283\n00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.710\nWe need to be able to\ndistinguish the difference here.\n\n284\n00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.740\nIf we're gonna actually say hey,\nhere's what a project needs to be,\n\n285\n00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.770\nand somebody says aren't\nwe already doing that?\n\n286\n00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:09.590\nAnd you go, no, not really, because even\nthough some of that stuff might be going\n\n287\n00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:13.000\non, it's not producing something\nthat's actually a unique product.\n\n288\n00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.880\nIt wasn't actually ending up temporary.\n\n289\n00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.340\nWhat we actually now need is\nthat idea of understanding that.\n\n290\n00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:22.260\nSo ongoing work usually\nhas no beginning or end,\n\n291\n00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:27.480\nunless the ending of that particular work\nprocess is replaced with something else.\n\n292\n00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.500\nAnd that's actually the key\nwhen we start seeing that.\n\n293\n00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:34.540\nSo let me give you some examples of\nwhat we call ongoing work as well, and\n\n294\n00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.180\nwe're gonna take a look at this, too.\n\n295\n00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.100\nSo let me do this.\n\n296\n00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.230\nBaseball, right?\n\n297\n00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.342\nIf you actually take a look at\nthe idea of a baseball, well,\n\n298\n00:15:42.342 --> 00:15:45.582\nthat's a unique product into itself and\nthere's people that\n\n299\n00:15:45.582 --> 00:15:49.339\nfollow it almost as a religion at times\nwhen the boys of summer come out.\n\n300\n00:15:49.339 --> 00:15:53.541\nBut the very fact is manufacturing\nbaseballs, that's not actually some unique\n\n301\n00:15:53.541 --> 00:15:56.631\nproduct, that's somebody\nactually every day coming in,\n\n302\n00:15:56.631 --> 00:15:59.656\ngetting the actual right skins\nto fit the way they need to,\n\n303\n00:15:59.656 --> 00:16:04.196\nsewing them all together, making sure the\nsize, the shape Everything else is there.\n\n304\n00:16:04.196 --> 00:16:07.701\nThe manufacturing process is\nthe ongoing type of work that\n\n305\n00:16:07.701 --> 00:16:10.360\nwe're talking about as well.\n\n306\n00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.810\nAlso, another one that we could\nactually take an example of here,\n\n307\n00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.960\nis something like teaching\na subject inside of high school or\n\n308\n00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.790\nupper school depending on where\nyou are in the world, right?\n\n309\n00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:24.850\nIt's not that that can't be a unique\nproject, but because you are hired as\n\n310\n00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:29.070\na teacher to teach at a particular\ngrade level at a particular school.\n\n311\n00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.038\nWell, you've actually\njust hired to teach and\n\n312\n00:16:31.038 --> 00:16:33.657\nthey've assigned you some type\nof work to teach at that point.\n\n313\n00:16:33.657 --> 00:16:38.588\nAnd you can even talk about the idea of\nsome type of housekeeping service that you\n\n314\n00:16:38.588 --> 00:16:41.290\nmay have, lets say, in the hotel.\n\n315\n00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.420\nThe very fact is, that,\nthat is actually just ongoing work.\n\n316\n00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:48.340\nYou're hired there to make sure\nthat the process continues on.\n\n317\n00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:52.020\nIn a project, remember,\nthat the key here is temporary endeavor,\n\n318\n00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.790\nthat actually leads to\nsome unique product.\n\n319\n00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:59.400\nSo what I wanted to do is to make\nsure that we could distinguish this\n\n320\n00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.070\na little bit easier,\n\n321\n00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.220\nif I could actually get everything\nout of the way here on our slide.\n\n322\n00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:07.650\nAnd so I actually created four\ndifferent examples as a trial for\n\n323\n00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:10.140\nus to run through, and\ndon't worry about it.\n\n324\n00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.430\nWhether or not you know this or\nnot, hopefully after this,\n\n325\n00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.810\nyou will be able to understand.\n\n326\n00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:18.220\nSo the key ideas, one is a temporary\nendeavor, the other one is an ongoing\n\n327\n00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.695\neffort that supports a production\nof products, services, and results.\n\n328\n00:17:21.695 --> 00:17:26.366\nThe other one is actually undertaken\nto create that unique product,\n\n329\n00:17:26.366 --> 00:17:28.990\nservice, or result as well.\n\n330\n00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:31.540\nSo in example number one.\n\n331\n00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:35.500\nWhat about a service contract for\nlandscaping.\n\n332\n00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.270\nSo if we were to talk\nabout something like that,\n\n333\n00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:42.430\nsomebody says, no I work on this project\nbecause I'm doing it for ITProTV Studios.\n\n334\n00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:49.630\nEven though you might be doing it for\nITProTV Studios, for your company,\n\n335\n00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:53.290\nthat might actually be a project that they\nhandle as far as a customer goes, but\n\n336\n00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:59.280\nthe service contract though, for\nlandscaping it, is probably not a project.\n\n337\n00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.060\nIt's actually some type of operational\ntype of work that goes on.\n\n338\n00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.040\nYou're hired on to\na landscaping contractor,\n\n339\n00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.750\na landscaping provider, well,\nthey're actually assigning you the work.\n\n340\n00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.980\nYou didn't actually have any\nchoice on what you're creating or\n\n341\n00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.180\nnot, they're telling you,\n\n342\n00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:16.620\nyou're gonna trim this hedge you're gonna\nactually do all this stuff out there.\n\n343\n00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.430\nSo you might actually see\nsomething like that, so\n\n344\n00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.330\nthat would be an example\nof some type of operation.\n\n345\n00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.810\nHired to teach in this upper school or\nhigh school.\n\n346\n00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.140\nI just mentioned this one.\n\n347\n00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.640\nCuz it's a good example,\ncuz you might think,\n\n348\n00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:32.510\nwell, that's great, that's something\nthat I only specifically teach math, so\n\n349\n00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:34.960\nthat's not something that every student's\nactually gonna have to go through for\n\n350\n00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.410\nthe rest of their life, but\nit's something you will, right?\n\n351\n00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.990\nYou're gonna teach year after year,\nsame thing over and over again.\n\n352\n00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.690\nThat is an operation that\nyou're actually supporting.\n\n353\n00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:47.100\nBut what if instead you were\nhired to teach for two months?\n\n354\n00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:52.530\nTo get a company ready for migrating the\nentire office staff over to Office 365.\n\n355\n00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:55.390\nWell now that's a temporary endeavor.\n\n356\n00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.720\nYou're hired for something specific\nthat they hadn't done before,\n\n357\n00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:02.700\nsomething unique which is to teach and\nmigrate all the users over to Office 365.\n\n358\n00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.210\nWell, you can see why\nthat temporary endeavor,\n\n359\n00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:10.240\nleads to hopefully a lasting result\nthat now that company's users\n\n360\n00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:15.070\nare gonna be able to migrate their entire\nuser base over to Office 365, and then\n\n361\n00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:18.990\nthey'll no longer be using some of the\nother products that they're using instead.\n\n362\n00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:23.942\nWhat if you're hired instead to develop\nsome type of Java programming for\n\n363\n00:19:23.942 --> 00:19:26.180\nITProTV's website?\n\n364\n00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.180\nNow, this one's a little bit tricky here,\n\n365\n00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.900\nbecause I don't mention the idea\nof a temporary time element here.\n\n366\n00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:36.450\nBut what I do mention though,\nis only for the website itself.\n\n367\n00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.810\nSo I didn't just hire you\non as a Java programmer to\n\n368\n00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:43.378\ndo just whatever Java\nprogramming as part of ITProTV.\n\n369\n00:19:43.378 --> 00:19:46.530\nI said hey, here's a specific thing\nthat has to go on our website\n\n370\n00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.360\nin terms of Java programming.\n\n371\n00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.830\nAnd in that particular situation, that\nmight be something where Dan comes in and\n\n372\n00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:54.890\nspends two months doing it.\n\n373\n00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.500\nBut after those two months,\nwe don't have job for them.\n\n374\n00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.730\nSo that is also an example\nof a project as well.\n\n375\n00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:04.540\nSo, our key here, right, is to understand\nthe differences between these two.\n\n376\n00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:09.540\nThe project, as well as ongoing work, and\nthat's actually something we need to make\n\n377\n00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.100\nsure we do understand if we\nare gonna do that, right?\n\n378\n00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.840\nSo distinguishing the difference between\nthem is gonna be very important for\n\n379\n00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.350\nus as we start to move into\nour project management career.\n\n380\n00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:23.270\nIt's not easy at the beginning because\nyou look at everything and go, well,\n\n381\n00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.120\nI only worked on that for two weeks.\n\n382\n00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.010\nWell, that probably wasn't\nbecause it was a project.\n\n383\n00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.350\nIt's because they moved you\nto another department, or\n\n384\n00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.550\nsomething else might have\nended up happening here.\n\n385\n00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:34.990\nSo just kind of realize,\nthat we need to as project managers\n\n386\n00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:37.940\nto be able to go this is a project and\nthis isn't.\n\n387\n00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.940\nYou don't want somebody to\nhand you something then say,\n\n388\n00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.700\nhere's a project I want you to work on and\nthen you realize something.\n\n389\n00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.610\nIt's not a project they want you to\nwork on, they want you to take over.\n\n390\n00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:51.500\nAnd that's what actually ends up being key\nhere when we start taking a look there.\n\n391\n00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.200\n>> Now Ronnie, we've been talking about\nthe difference between a project and\n\n392\n00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.870\nan ongoing operation.\n\n393\n00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:58.350\nAnd obviously they're different, right.\n\n394\n00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:01.050\nYou've done a good job of pointing out\nthe differences between the two, but\n\n395\n00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:05.470\nthey do seem to be very connected,\nvery correlating.\n\n396\n00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:11.030\n>> No doubt, and that,\nas much as separation as I've tried to do\n\n397\n00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.300\nIn reality, though,\nthey're really like this.\n\n398\n00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.290\nSo, all you've heard me\ndo at this point is pull,\n\n399\n00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:21.570\njust yank every single hair apart and\ngo here's two very distinct lines.\n\n400\n00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:24.140\nBu the reality is that\nthey do go hand in hand.\n\n401\n00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:27.810\nRemember that even if I complete a project\nin anything that we've talked about so\n\n402\n00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:31.490\nfar as an example,\nit's great that it's a unique product.\n\n403\n00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:35.000\nBut what if I want some other\nthings to happen with that product,\n\n404\n00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.970\nsuch as the example of razors.\n\n405\n00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:42.830\nI want my six and a half blade razor\nto outsell the five blade razor.\n\n406\n00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:45.615\n>> That half blade is really\ngoing to make a difference.\n\n407\n00:21:45.615 --> 00:21:46.121\n>> That half blade razor may-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n408\n00:21:46.121 --> 00:21:48.179\n>> But what if I wanted to do that.\n\n409\n00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:53.290\nEven though I said here's the model for\nit, how many razors\n\n410\n00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:57.210\nwould I have to produce to actually be\nable to overtake the sales of the filing.\n\n411\n00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.000\nI don't know.\n\n412\n00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000\nHeck, I know it's not one.\n\n413\n00:21:59.000 --> 00:21:59.500\nI know that.\n\n414\n00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.420\nThat one may have cost me what, a million\ndollars in prototype, hopefully not.\n\n415\n00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.890\nBut let's just say it was a million\ndollars in the prototype.\n\n416\n00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:10.243\nIf I wanna outsell those five blade once,\nright?\n\n417\n00:22:10.243 --> 00:22:14.000\nWhat I need to be able to do then, is be\nable to mass produce those, be able to\n\n418\n00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.881\nhave some type of manufacturing base,\nbe able to actually talk to a marketing\n\n419\n00:22:17.881 --> 00:22:22.310\ndepartment about how we actually overtake\nthis, how do we do stuff like that.\n\n420\n00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.130\nWell, essentially that means my\nproduct and the end result of it,\n\n421\n00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.680\nis actually going to be handed\nover to some type of operation.\n\n422\n00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:32.160\nSo even though a project may actually\nproduce something unique, for\n\n423\n00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.420\nthe results of that\noperation to be successful,\n\n424\n00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:38.510\ndepending on how you talk about success,\nthat means that it needs to be turned over\n\n425\n00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:42.270\nto some operational base that will\nthen take that product and go,\n\n426\n00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:47.635\nI can actually reproduce, make\nrepetitive those same results here and\n\n427\n00:22:47.635 --> 00:22:51.295\nthen get it on to the market as well,\nand so they do go hand in hand.\n\n428\n00:22:51.295 --> 00:22:54.365\n>> Yeah, I actually just saw\nsomething that was a documentary\n\n429\n00:22:54.365 --> 00:22:57.595\non Ford developing the latest\nversion of the Mustang.\n\n430\n00:22:57.595 --> 00:23:01.495\nThe Mustang is a tried and\ntrue American icon obviously.\n\n431\n00:23:01.495 --> 00:23:05.315\nIt's been around since the 60s, but\nthey've come out with different iterations\n\n432\n00:23:05.315 --> 00:23:09.470\nof it and they were talking about the\nproject team that's coming out with the,\n\n433\n00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:13.550\nwell which is out now,\nas of this is a 2015 and\n\n434\n00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:17.980\n16 of this latest version of it, and had a\nyear to develop what it's gonna look like.\n\n435\n00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:22.370\nAnd once they're done, they develop, they\ncreate Mustangs that's what Ford does,\n\n436\n00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:25.430\nthey make cars ,Mustang is\none of them that they create.\n\n437\n00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:29.610\nThey had a project, once that project was\ndone they had to completely figure it out.\n\n438\n00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:31.040\nThen they tool their garage and\n\n439\n00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.980\nthey create Mustangs over and\nover and over again.\n\n440\n00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.980\nThat's the ongoing operation where\nthe project is the development\n\n441\n00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:36.860\nof the new style.\n\n442\n00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:40.210\n>> No doubt that that's actually\na great example on a large scale.\n\n443\n00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.460\nOn a fairly small scale,\n\n444\n00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.990\nlet me go ahead and I wanna make sure\nthat I actually remember this correctly.\n\n445\n00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:46.578\nBut here in ITProTV studios,\n\n446\n00:23:46.578 --> 00:23:50.638\nthe equipment that we use today and\neven the show that we are doing right now,\n\n447\n00:23:50.638 --> 00:23:54.908\nis different than the equipment when we\nfirst started out a couple of years ago.\n\n448\n00:23:54.908 --> 00:23:59.207\nWe started out with what we call one\nof those the new tech tri caster and\n\n449\n00:23:59.207 --> 00:24:03.376\nthey were using a grass valley GV\ndirector, is what we're using.\n\n450\n00:24:03.376 --> 00:24:07.703\nWell in terms of a project, well you gotta\nrealize that it's a little bit daunting\n\n451\n00:24:07.703 --> 00:24:11.905\nfor us that started out with the new tech\nto move over to the grass valley director\n\n452\n00:24:11.905 --> 00:24:15.793\n,so what ended up happening is that\nthere had to be a small project right,\n\n453\n00:24:15.793 --> 00:24:19.997\nthat actually went on saying were gonna\nmigrate what from the new tech tricastor\n\n454\n00:24:19.997 --> 00:24:22.330\nover to the grass valley itself.\n\n455\n00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:25.150\nSo that means changing out the equipment,\nchanging out some of the things that you\n\n456\n00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:29.680\nsee, such as the little bug that\nyou see on my shoulder over there.\n\n457\n00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.400\nChanging those things out,\ngetting all those things working and\n\n458\n00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:37.000\nmoving in the flawless way that we want\nthem actually move and do all that, right?\n\n459\n00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.980\nAll that stuff had to actually\nbe changed out and done.\n\n460\n00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.170\nBut once that was done,\nit doesn't mean that we end it, right?\n\n461\n00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:46.340\nSo that project with actually\nswitching that stuff out is done.\n\n462\n00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.420\nBut now, what are we doing?\n\n463\n00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:52.360\nWe actually use it in ongoing operations\nto help us to produce that show that we\n\n464\n00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.370\nneed to produce each and every day, right?\n\n465\n00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:59.840\nSo that's where the ending of that\nproject of moving from one product\n\n466\n00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.180\nto a new product.\n\n467\n00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:06.130\nNow we turn that over to people like\nMegan and to Titus and we make sure that\n\n468\n00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:09.300\nthey are actually able to produce\nthe shows that we need them to produce.\n\n469\n00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.520\nSo that's where you see that\nswitch into the operations.\n\n470\n00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.110\nNow don't get me wrong they could have\nparticipated in that switch, I don't know\n\n471\n00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:20.655\nif they, I don't think that they were\nthen part of ITProTV Studios yet.\n\n472\n00:25:20.655 --> 00:25:23.630\nBut at that point though,\nwhen we actually switched over,\n\n473\n00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:26.590\nit did take a little bit of time but\nonce that switch was over,\n\n474\n00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:29.280\nwe essentially handed it over\nagain to the production team.\n\n475\n00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.140\nProduction team's actually\nwho uses the Tricast or\n\n476\n00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.950\nwho uses the Grass Valley Director for\nus to be able to do what we need to do.\n\n477\n00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:39.410\nSo small projects, large products,\nno matter what happens here, you do.\n\n478\n00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:41.918\nYou still have the idea of projects and\noperations.\n\n479\n00:25:41.918 --> 00:25:43.780\nReally going hand in hand.\n\n480\n00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:47.060\nThe project can end with a successful\nproduct that we wanna create but\n\n481\n00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.830\nthe overall results,\nif it's actually to make money,\n\n482\n00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:52.490\nis to hand it over to\noperations somehow if\n\n483\n00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:55.420\nwe're gonna actually do something\nelse with that particular product.\n\n484\n00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.940\nWe can create a unique stand\nalone product by itself and\n\n485\n00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.040\nthe end result is whatever we create.\n\n486\n00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.260\nAnd that's all that it is,\nit's perfectly fine.\n\n487\n00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.630\nBut if you are actually planning\non doing something else with it,\n\n488\n00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.000\nit does normally turn over in operations.\n\n489\n00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:07.990\n>> Excellent stuff.\n\n490\n00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.820\nNow Ronnie, we've talked a lot of\nthe different characteristics and\n\n491\n00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:12.940\nattributes of projects and operations.\n\n492\n00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.610\nAre there any other\ncharacteristics about projects\n\n493\n00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:17.270\nthat we need to be aware of for the exam?\n\n494\n00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:17.820\n>> You really do,\n\n495\n00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:22.220\nyou need to pay attention to a few of\nthe ways that exam will break down.\n\n496\n00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.360\nThe idea of what a project actually is.\n\n497\n00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.000\nSo let me go and\npoint some of those out and\n\n498\n00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.680\nonce again, just as a reiteration here.\n\n499\n00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.500\nOkay?\n\n500\n00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.200\nSo all projects essentially turn out and\n\n501\n00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.830\nthey end up following into different\nresults here that we have available.\n\n502\n00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:37.380\nOkay?\n\n503\n00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.680\nFirst and foremost of course,\nremember it is a temporary endeavor.\n\n504\n00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.270\nAnd that normally means in\nall the stricter sense,\n\n505\n00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:46.480\nright that there is gonna be a beginning\nand an end to this project and\n\n506\n00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.740\nthat needs to be established before\nanything is actually done at all.\n\n507\n00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:50.420\nOkay?\n\n508\n00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.240\nIt's not an indication\nof the overall duration.\n\n509\n00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:57.490\nA project can last years and years,\nbut we know that there's gonna be\n\n510\n00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:00.350\nan actual beginning and\nthere should be an actual end.\n\n511\n00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:03.680\nSo that's what we mean\nby temporary endeavor.\n\n512\n00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:08.450\nIt ends up delivering a unique product,\nservice, or result, and this is\n\n513\n00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:13.280\nactually done in a tangible way, or even\nan intangible way in this process, right.\n\n514\n00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:17.520\nTangibility here would be we do produce\nthat six and a half razor, six and\n\n515\n00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.950\na half blade razor, okay.\n\n516\n00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:21.120\nThat's a tangible result that can happen.\n\n517\n00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.020\nAnd the intangible result is something\nthat may actually be something\n\n518\n00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.530\nthat we did talk about\nin a previous episode.\n\n519\n00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:29.750\nWhere now we implemented a project,\nand what it does is it saves\n\n520\n00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:33.680\neverybody let's say 15 minutes\na day on things that they're doing.\n\n521\n00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.080\nThat's intangible as far\nas what we can see, but\n\n522\n00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.820\nin the end,\nright after over a period of time\n\n523\n00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:43.490\nwe're gonna see that that's really gonna\nbe cost savings to an entire company.\n\n524\n00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:45.500\nHard to actually view right now, but\n\n525\n00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.310\noverall at the end result\nit's actually gonna save some\n\n526\n00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:51.035\nbecause we're actually gonna end up\nhaving some increased productivity.\n\n527\n00:27:51.035 --> 00:27:56.470\n[COUGH] The other thing of course\nis that we are constrained by time.\n\n528\n00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:59.040\nAnd this is kind of a key element here.\n\n529\n00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.720\nAll the work inside our project needs\nto be done according to a schedule and\n\n530\n00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.550\nthe reason for\nthat is that inside of projects, right?\n\n531\n00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:11.530\nYou may have it where one task cannot\nbegin before another task finishes.\n\n532\n00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:14.830\nSo if you do have a bunch of people\nsaying I'll get it done one day,\n\n533\n00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:18.040\nwe'll that's not good enough cuz\nwe can actually all do that.\n\n534\n00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.570\nBut we have to be willing to work within\nthe time constraints that we're given.\n\n535\n00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:25.030\nSo we actually work inside of what\nwe call scheduled work at times.\n\n536\n00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:30.030\nThe very fact is that our particular task\nthat we have, that should be the key and\n\n537\n00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:33.990\nthe point where when we're finished with\nours, then the next part of the process\n\n538\n00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:37.920\ncan go on and actually end up\nfinishing that project as well.\n\n539\n00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.440\nIt also means that you understand\nthat we're also meeting of course,\n\n540\n00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:45.950\nwe have the number of required resources\nthat we need to work on our project and\n\n541\n00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:49.450\nthe amount of resources to\ndo the work that we have and\n\n542\n00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:52.000\nthat there's a level of\nacceptance that we'll do.\n\n543\n00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.860\nNot every result will be acceptable.\n\n544\n00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:57.740\nNot every product that actually\nends up getting produced\n\n545\n00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.200\nwill actually do that way.\n\n546\n00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.290\nNot every service will actually\nbe up to our specs that we want.\n\n547\n00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:04.640\nSo there is some specification,\n\n548\n00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.800\nthere is some level of quality\nthat we will be willing to accept.\n\n549\n00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.570\nAnd then, I know one of the ones\nthat I kind of don't emphasize,\n\n550\n00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:16.990\nI probably should a little bit more often,\nis what we call stakeholder satisfaction.\n\n551\n00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:18.870\nThe problem is the term satisfaction,\n\n552\n00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:21.890\nokay it because it's so,\n>> Subjective.\n\n553\n00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:25.120\n>> It's very subjective it really\nmeans something that we just don't\n\n554\n00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:28.040\nreally know because everybody's\nsatisfaction is different depending on\n\n555\n00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:32.920\nthe day of the week, so Monday vanilla\nice cream perfectly fine with me, but\n\n556\n00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:37.820\nTuesday it may not be, so that's where\nyou have to actually be able to kind of\n\n557\n00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:41.310\nfold your hands around what it means here\n>> We take a look at the idea of\n\n558\n00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:42.920\nstakeholder satisfaction.\n\n559\n00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.400\nWhat we mean by this is that their\nparticular satisfaction needs to be\n\n560\n00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:52.300\ndesigned or not designed specified\nin what we call smart goals.\n\n561\n00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.750\nAnd you've probably heard this before\nin any type of team building thing that\n\n562\n00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.960\nyou've ever done but\nthis is what we want from the stakeholder.\n\n563\n00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.860\nWe want to make sure that when we talk\nabout satisfying their particular\n\n564\n00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.580\nrequirements here that\nthere are specific goals.\n\n565\n00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:06.870\nThat they can be measured at some point,\nright.\n\n566\n00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:10.750\nThat they are attainable which\nis actually a key element here.\n\n567\n00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:15.350\nNo pie in the sky here, this has to be\nattainable, they have to be realistic,\n\n568\n00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:17.690\nthey cannot just be well just get it done.\n\n569\n00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:19.270\nThat doesn't make sense to us.\n\n570\n00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:21.090\nThey have to be realistic\nin what figure or\n\n571\n00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:23.380\ntime period know these things and timely,\n\n572\n00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:26.960\nin other words we have to finish this\nactually within those requirements there.\n\n573\n00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.900\nWe need to make sure that the stake\nholders understand that as well.\n\n574\n00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:34.830\nSo inside of a project, right there's a\nlot of elements that we need to make sure\n\n575\n00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.110\nthat we can actually do and\nthat we can characterize in this.\n\n576\n00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:41.590\nBecause when it comes down\nto project manager, right?\n\n577\n00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:44.770\nAll of project management,\neverything that we end up doing\n\n578\n00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:48.060\nactually makes us work within what we\ncall three different constraints here.\n\n579\n00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.960\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n580\n00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:53.220\nThose constraints a lot of times that\nyou hear about and everybody does this\n\n581\n00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:57.140\na little bit differently, I do this on the\npoints most of the time when you see this\n\n582\n00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.740\npeople actually line up these different\nqualities or whatever you want to on\n\n583\n00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:05.770\nthe side which is perfectly fine but\nwe talk about the idea of scope, time and\n\n584\n00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:09.930\ncost you may hear the terms\nrequirement schedule and budget.\n\n585\n00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:11.030\nSo what does that mean?\n\n586\n00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:12.700\nThat means that when\nyour working a project.\n\n587\n00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:15.190\nYou have to keep all these in balance.\n\n588\n00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:16.320\nOr what happens?\n\n589\n00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.640\nIf I emphasize that I want to save money.\n\n590\n00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:20.680\nRight here more.\n\n591\n00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.330\nOkay.\n\n592\n00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:25.800\nIf that is my overall go as\nthe pinpoint the idea of budget.\n\n593\n00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.730\nOr what ends up happening is that, that\nwill automatically affect requirement and\n\n594\n00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:31.640\nof course the schedule, okay?\n\n595\n00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.910\nThe budget means I'll actually go\nahead and maybe I'll cut short on\n\n596\n00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:39.250\nthe requirements, as quality will go low,\nor it will take me a lot longer in time.\n\n597\n00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:43.180\nIf I emphasize you have\nto be done on the 31st,\n\n598\n00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:47.910\nit may cost me a lot more money, or\nI may cut on out on a requirement.\n\n599\n00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:51.110\nIf I emphasized that\nquality has to be the best\n\n600\n00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:55.750\nit might take me a lot longer in time and\na lot more expenses here.\n\n601\n00:31:55.750 --> 00:32:00.030\nSo normally the old adage, and again I\nhate being cliche, but it works here.\n\n602\n00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:04.370\nIs that everybody want something good,\nfast, and cheap, okay?\n\n603\n00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:06.230\nThat's what every project wants to do.\n\n604\n00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:08.770\nBut the reality is you can\nonly really accomplish\n\n605\n00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:10.690\nall three if you keep them in balance.\n\n606\n00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:13.760\nBut you're not gonna actually\nbe able to do all of that, okay?\n\n607\n00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.270\nSo in other words, you'll be able to\ndo two out of the three is what will\n\n608\n00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:17.240\nend up happening.\n\n609\n00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:21.050\nYou focus in on cheap,\ndon't expect fast and good, okay?\n\n610\n00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:23.970\nYou focus in on good,\ndon't expect fast and cheap, okay?\n\n611\n00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:28.060\nFocus on the fast, you're not gonna\nget good and it might be cheap, but\n\n612\n00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:31.230\noverall though, just kind of realize\nit might not be cheap either.\n\n613\n00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:35.650\nSo you do have this kind of unusual\nconstraint that every project manager and\n\n614\n00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:38.090\nevery project is gonna be constrained by.\n\n615\n00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:41.800\nIf you actually find some task that you've\nactually worked on that is not constrained\n\n616\n00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:45.130\nby these things, more than likely,\nit's operational type of work.\n\n617\n00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:46.510\n>> That's excellent stuff Ronnie.\n\n618\n00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:48.450\nThis is the meat and potatoes.\n\n619\n00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:52.320\nSo that when you walk into that exam\nenvironment, you're gonna be able to\n\n620\n00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.140\nanswer the questions adequately, and then\nstart talking about what is a project,\n\n621\n00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.390\nyou're gonna be able to discern\nthe difference between that project and\n\n622\n00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:01.290\nan operation, something ongoing.\n\n623\n00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:04.760\nThank you Ronnie so much for\nhelping us be able to do that very thing,\n\n624\n00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.340\nwe appreciate you stopping by\nthe studio today and to do that for us.\n\n625\n00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.750\nWe also appreciate you guys watching.\n\n626\n00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:14.330\nWell we are gonna sign off we are kinda\nout of time for this here episode.\n\n627\n00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:16.740\nSo that being said,\nsigning off for ITProTV.\n\n628\n00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.350\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n629\n00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:19.000\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n630\n00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.043\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n631\n00:33:21.043 --> 00:33:26.460\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.660\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n4\n00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.300\nwe're continuing on with\nCompTIA's Project+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.590\nJoining me in the studio today to help\nlend his expertise on that very topic\n\n6\n00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.158\nis none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:28.158 --> 00:00:30.568\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Welcome to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:30.568 --> 00:00:31.168\nHow you doing today?\n\n9\n00:00:31.168 --> 00:00:32.228\n>> Well, I'm doing well.\n\n10\n00:00:32.228 --> 00:00:33.120\nI was afraid that you forgot my name.\n\n11\n00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.650\n>> It was a little pregnant pause there.\n\n12\n00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.860\n>> Yes, very nice.\n\n13\n00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.175\nBut hey, here we are.\n\n14\n00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:40.955\nWe're back with CompTIA Project+ and\nwe are ready to get started now.\n\n15\n00:00:40.955 --> 00:00:44.830\nNow, what we're doing today is we're gonna\ntalk about validating an actual project\n\n16\n00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.010\nas we get started here with some of\nthe things that we need to be able\n\n17\n00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.520\nto do, right?\n\n18\n00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.360\nSo in previous episodes, we've already\ntaken a look at the pre-project phases for\n\n19\n00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.090\nour project, and we also went back and\nwe emphasized what our project is.\n\n20\n00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.630\nWe talked about those\ndifferent characteristics\n\n21\n00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.580\nthat we have to understand, and now we're\nalso continuing to move on through here.\n\n22\n00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.560\nBut we need to take a little bit more\ndetailed look into validating the project.\n\n23\n00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.200\nAnd when it comes out to\na project validation,\n\n24\n00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.350\nwe're going to actually end up looking\nat two real overall scopes, but\n\n25\n00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.420\nwe're going to go into detail on each\nof those two sub-phases instead.\n\n26\n00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.251\nSo let's go ahead and\nstart off with our reminder here,\n\n27\n00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:25.240\nwhere projects actually begin and\nwhere they end.\n\n28\n00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.740\nRemember that every single\nproject is gonna have\n\n29\n00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.940\nabout five different phases that\nprojects tend to work through, right?\n\n30\n00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.910\nThe very initiation, or what we call\nthe pre-project planning, the pre-project\n\n31\n00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.100\nsetup, I want to call it planning\nbecause we're so used to planning, but\n\n32\n00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.570\nit's called pre-project setup here,\nis gonna be the initiation.\n\n33\n00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.900\nBefore anything is actually ever done,\n\n34\n00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.880\nwe need to be able to know\nwhat project we're working on.\n\n35\n00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.990\nWe need to be able to set it up and verify\nthat this is the project that we want.\n\n36\n00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.908\nAnd so make sure you go back and\ncheck those episodes out as we do so.\n\n37\n00:01:56.908 --> 00:02:01.133\nFrom that point, once you do\nhave that final project charter,\n\n38\n00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:04.420\nthat is when we start switching phases,\nright?\n\n39\n00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.848\nThe project charter gives us\nthe authorization that we need.\n\n40\n00:02:06.848 --> 00:02:09.130\nFrom that point,\nwe enter into the planning phase.\n\n41\n00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.705\nAnd the planning phase, normally,\nis gonna take the longest part of our\n\n42\n00:02:13.705 --> 00:02:18.055\nproject management because a lot has\nto go into the planning phase for\n\n43\n00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:20.990\nus before we can actually\neven begin any work.\n\n44\n00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.771\nWe wanna make sure we show the detail, the\ntime, and the effort inside that planning\n\n45\n00:02:24.771 --> 00:02:28.350\nto make sure that we've actually covered\nall that we actually needed to there.\n\n46\n00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.913\nOnce we have all the plans in place, we\nthen begin to transition into execution,\n\n47\n00:02:32.913 --> 00:02:35.948\nin which the project work\nis now being accomplished.\n\n48\n00:02:35.948 --> 00:02:40.160\nAnd also, we now turn into more\nof a monitoring, and, of course,\n\n49\n00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.430\na controlling agent at that point.\n\n50\n00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.270\nKeeping things on schedule, right?\n\n51\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.810\nAccording to time, cost, and, of course,\nwork effort that we have on-hand here.\n\n52\n00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.430\nAnd remember that even though these\nthings might continue to move forward,\n\n53\n00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.270\nwe might find out that what it does is,\nas we move forward,\n\n54\n00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.620\nwe run into different things\nwe weren't expecting.\n\n55\n00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.814\nThat may change our planning for\nlater stages, and\n\n56\n00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:03.530\nmay even change some of the outcomes\nthat we actually thought.\n\n57\n00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.378\nSo those can also bring in inputs\ninto new plans that actually cause us\n\n58\n00:03:08.378 --> 00:03:11.898\nto readjust the way that\nour project's gonna go.\n\n59\n00:03:11.898 --> 00:03:14.378\nAnd ultimately, of course,\nthere is a close out,\n\n60\n00:03:14.378 --> 00:03:18.590\nwhich brings our temporary endeavor to the\nend, hopefully to the result that we want,\n\n61\n00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.390\nto the product or service that we\nthought we've actually created.\n\n62\n00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.890\nSo that's kind of a brief overview of the\nway that all projects end up running, and\n\n63\n00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.480\nif you're sitting there going Ronnie, you\nsay this at the beginning of every show,\n\n64\n00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.210\nthere's a reason why, because it's fairly\nimportant that we understand that.\n\n65\n00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.910\nSo now what we're doing is we\nare now moving on then, right?\n\n66\n00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.840\nWe've described the idea of being able\nto identify the difference between\n\n67\n00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.680\noperational work, and of course,\na project that we would end up working on.\n\n68\n00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.810\nAnd now what we need to do, of course,\nis once we actually know that,\n\n69\n00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.900\nwe need to validate what our project\nis actually going to be here.\n\n70\n00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.490\nAnd in other words,\nwhy does it actually exist?\n\n71\n00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.165\nAnd that is something that\nwe need to understand.\n\n72\n00:03:57.165 --> 00:04:00.110\nOkay?\nAnd the whole point of this is not saying\n\n73\n00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.370\nI know I why the project needs to exist.\n\n74\n00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.420\nIn your mind, that's perfectly fine.\n\n75\n00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.933\nBut remember that as a project manager\nyou're gonna be working with a ton of\n\n76\n00:04:07.933 --> 00:04:11.335\ndifferent people, and right at\nthe beginning, it's gonna be a project\n\n77\n00:04:11.335 --> 00:04:15.690\nstakeholder at least that's going to be\nsomewhat like the project sponsor itself.\n\n78\n00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.060\nAnd there may be a team of people\nthat you end up working with, and\n\n79\n00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.320\nwhat you need to do is you\nneed to formalize process.\n\n80\n00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.420\nIn other words, it needs to be documented.\n\n81\n00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.046\nAnd the validation itself needs to\nbe documented in the process, and\n\n82\n00:04:27.046 --> 00:04:30.650\nwhat actually makes this project\nneed to come into existence.\n\n83\n00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.100\nAnd that's what we're gonna look at today.\n\n84\n00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.820\nAll right, so what we're really doing\nis we're preparing a business case.\n\n85\n00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.510\nNow, remember that the business case for\n\n86\n00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.660\nus is trying to make sure\nthat there is some reason,\n\n87\n00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.600\nsome real justification, not just because\nwell, it's what we want to do here.\n\n88\n00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.130\nSo what does that boil down to when\nit comes down to project management?\n\n89\n00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.570\nWhat is it that we depend on?\n\n90\n00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.570\nRemember what I said, you can't just\ndepend on your feelings to do so.\n\n91\n00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.590\nWell, there's really seven areas that we\nneed to cover if we want to take a look at\n\n92\n00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.730\nthe idea here of taking a look at\nwhy a project might actually exist.\n\n93\n00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.540\nAnd normally, again, it kind of breaks\ndown into this, that there's a demand or\n\n94\n00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.280\nbusiness need that\nthe project actually exist.\n\n95\n00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.370\nSo what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna slowly and\n\n96\n00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.810\ncarefully take a look at these seven\ndifferent business cases that we have.\n\n97\n00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.891\nAnd let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen here and\n\n98\n00:05:19.891 --> 00:05:22.792\nthen we can talk about them\njust a little bit more.\n\n99\n00:05:22.792 --> 00:05:25.840\nLooks like, actually, let me see if\nI can zoom in just a little bit more.\n\n100\n00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.690\nThere we go.\n\n101\n00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.265\nThat might make it a little\nbit easier to see.\n\n102\n00:05:28.265 --> 00:05:31.510\n>> Now Ronny, I noticed one of these\nthat are up there are pet projects.\n\n103\n00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.370\nIt's not on that list.\n\n104\n00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.840\n>> Yeah,\nit doesn't seem to be on that list, and\n\n105\n00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.640\nthat's kind of neat that it really isn't,\nbut it's very easy to fall into.\n\n106\n00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.189\nDaniel is probably working for an\norganization in which people always came\n\n107\n00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:47.300\nup with pet projects, and just because it\nwas money, you might as well go do it.\n\n108\n00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.490\nBecause we can.\n\n109\n00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.310\nSome people, because of their authority\nthere or their seniority there, I guess,\n\n110\n00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.530\nmore than anything else, they were just\nable to work on whatever they wanted to.\n\n111\n00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.100\nBut as a project manager,\n\n112\n00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.910\nyou might be able to do that if you\nare actually in a projectized environment.\n\n113\n00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.010\nBut a lot of times though, the money\nis tight, the money is short, and\n\n114\n00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.020\nthat means if you're actually going to\npresent this, you need to actually present\n\n115\n00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.730\nsome justification that's gonna\nmake it valid for everyone,\n\n116\n00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.340\nis what we're taking a look at.\n\n117\n00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.930\nSo the first one is really\nkind of the key one for\n\n118\n00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.590\nmost of us, which is the idea\nof some type of market demand.\n\n119\n00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:22.660\nOkay?\n\n120\n00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.010\nWhat ends up happening is that you see,\nand\n\n121\n00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.230\nwhat you wanna convince somebody else to\nsee, which is normally, again, the project\n\n122\n00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.960\nstakeholders that are there, that we have\naround us, is gonna be a market demand.\n\n123\n00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.970\nAn opportunity that we can\nsee that drives the need for\n\n124\n00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.380\nthe project to come into existence.\n\n125\n00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.080\nOkay?\n\n126\n00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.030\nAnd that is by far probably the reason\nwhy most companies end up actually\n\n127\n00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.676\nputting money into project developments,\nright?\n\n128\n00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:51.550\nInto future developments or\nproduct developments, and\n\n129\n00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.020\neverything else that goes on.\n\n130\n00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.020\nNow, what I want to do is, I want to take\nan example here of something that is,\n\n131\n00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.870\nto me, actually one of the neat\nthings that ended up happening.\n\n132\n00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:07.430\nI came from the day before\nthe smartphones were really popular.\n\n133\n00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.020\nSo I had the original flip phone, I had\nthe brick phone, I had all these things.\n\n134\n00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.920\nEssentially, they were just phones, right?\n\n135\n00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.900\nThey weren't really accessories.\n\n136\n00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.930\nDan, you remember those days?\n\n137\n00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.570\nWhen they just weren't really accessories,\n\n138\n00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.797\nthey were just things that you\nhad cause you had to have them?\n\n139\n00:07:20.797 --> 00:07:22.510\n>> Yeah, I totally remember having those.\n\n140\n00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.378\n>> Yeah.\n\n141\n00:07:24.378 --> 00:07:24.940\n>> I had a flip phone I had a bag phone.\n\n142\n00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.590\n>> A bag phone?\n>> Yeah, back in the day.\n\n143\n00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.525\n>> Yeah, you didn't just carry that around\nthe mall with you, just to look cool?\n\n144\n00:07:30.525 --> 00:07:31.090\n>> Yeah, no.\n\n145\n00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.670\n[LAUGH]\n>> So most of us didn't do that, but\n\n146\n00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.890\none of the phenomenons that I realized,\nthat actually had a market demand,\n\n147\n00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.370\nwhich was something I didn't realize\nright away until I started seeing it,\n\n148\n00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.960\nis that all of a sudden people\nstarted buying iPhones.\n\n149\n00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.240\nNow, I'm not talking\nabout the iPhone itself.\n\n150\n00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.870\nDon't get me wrong,\nthat's a great project.\n\n151\n00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.380\nIt has made more money for\nApple than anything else on the planet.\n\n152\n00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.242\nBut along with that, people started\nrealizing my gosh, if I carry this around,\n\n153\n00:07:54.242 --> 00:07:55.578\nit's gonna get scratched.\n\n154\n00:07:55.578 --> 00:07:56.970\nIt's gonna get, you know.\n\n155\n00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.707\nAnd so people started kind\nof polishing them every day.\n\n156\n00:08:01.707 --> 00:08:06.247\nBut after a while someone saw\na need that was there, okay.\n\n157\n00:08:06.247 --> 00:08:10.877\nAnd these are all those companies that\nhave produced those different covers for\n\n158\n00:08:10.877 --> 00:08:12.200\nthe iPhones, right?\n\n159\n00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.460\nThe protectors that are out there, right.\n\n160\n00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.140\nWhatever it is, all those different\ncompanies that are out there.\n\n161\n00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.190\nThey produce so many of them.\n\n162\n00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.948\nWell think about that,\nthat was a market demand, right?\n\n163\n00:08:21.948 --> 00:08:25.559\nThey didn't exist before\nthe idea of that iPhone, but\n\n164\n00:08:25.559 --> 00:08:29.325\nnow you can barely walk into\nany retail store out there and\n\n165\n00:08:29.325 --> 00:08:33.520\nthere's not a sale for\nsome type of protector out there.\n\n166\n00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.500\nWell imagine that that is a demand\nneed that we're talking about.\n\n167\n00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.200\nThe very fact is the marketplace there's\nan opportunity that somebody looked at\n\n168\n00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.560\nsaid main, we can produce these things,\ncharge an arm and a leg for them and\n\n169\n00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.620\npeople will buy them to\nprotect their phones.\n\n170\n00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.950\nWell, notice that you can see why market\ndemand is why somebody actually wants to\n\n171\n00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:58.480\nput money into projects developing these\nthing because of what you have out there.\n\n172\n00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.020\nAnd whoever did it,\nincredibly smart because there's so\n\n173\n00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.600\nmany different models of\nsmart phones out there.\n\n174\n00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.760\nAnd that's a product line\nthat you can sit there and\n\n175\n00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.910\ngo look, it's really just a piece of\nplastic and you mold it to that phone.\n\n176\n00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.950\nIt now becomes something\nactually very neat for us.\n\n177\n00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:15.050\n>> Yeah, lot's of those guys running\naround out there, these days.\n\n178\n00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:18.020\nJust do a quick search on Amazon for\n\n179\n00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.320\nyour specific smart phone for\na tempered glass, right?\n\n180\n00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.520\nYou're gonna have just a bazillion,\nthat's not a real number.\n\n181\n00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.950\nBut you're gonna get a lot of results for\nthat.\n\n182\n00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:30.350\nAnd that's just what Ronnie was saying.\n\n183\n00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.420\nThere was,\nthey saw a market need for it and\n\n184\n00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.880\ntherefore someone said,\nhey, let's create this.\n\n185\n00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.350\nThey created project, they looked up\ntheir project, they fulfilled it.\n\n186\n00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:39.410\nAnd now they have a product and\n\n187\n00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.688\nthat's gonna be an ongoing\nthing that they create.\n\n188\n00:09:41.688 --> 00:09:42.440\nEnds in and get to us.\n\n189\n00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.350\n>> Yeah, and the other thing that we\ncan also see here is what we call just\n\n190\n00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.850\na regular business need as well.\n\n191\n00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:52.440\nNow a great example of that\nis something that's actually\n\n192\n00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.730\nhappened right here on IT Pro Tv.\n\n193\n00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.930\nWhen we first started and remember the\nideas of it actually coming into being,\n\n194\n00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:02.160\nour first thing was to get some\ntype of website up and going.\n\n195\n00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.820\nThat was pretty much it.\n\n196\n00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:08.140\nSo what we had is that we didn't\nhave a professional web designer.\n\n197\n00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.860\nWe were just a bunch of guys that\nsaid we just need a website.\n\n198\n00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:12.620\nSo what do we do?\n\n199\n00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.200\nWe bring up a WordPress website.\n\n200\n00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.660\nNothing against WordPress, it worked,\n\n201\n00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.360\nit did the functionality\nthat we needed it to.\n\n202\n00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.270\nAnd we still use WordPress\ntoday in part of it.\n\n203\n00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.210\nBut what we started to\nrealize is as we grew and\n\n204\n00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:27.600\nas our business became better, is that\nwe couldn't do everything on that one.\n\n205\n00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.340\nAnd so all of a sudden what you\nrealize is that there is project done\n\n206\n00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.990\nthat you may have to go beyond\nwhat you have right then, right?\n\n207\n00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:38.020\nGrowing pains of your business\nmay actually call out\n\n208\n00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.640\na particular project for you to do.\n\n209\n00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:44.090\nSo what ended up happening is that we\nrealized we need a different backend\n\n210\n00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:47.260\nthe house over all our\ndata versus the WordPress\n\n211\n00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.160\nstuff that we had at the beginning.\n\n212\n00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.340\nAnd we always had a different one,\nbut as our coming group,\n\n213\n00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.880\nthey started moving more and\nmore away from dependent on word press.\n\n214\n00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.030\nToward everything else that she's secured\nin the way that we want to, and so\n\n215\n00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.920\nyou may see that she's an internal\nbusiness type of need instead.\n\n216\n00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.000\nYou might go,\njust keep the front in by itself.\n\n217\n00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.650\nBut we wanted to integrate so\nmuch into that one front end here.\n\n218\n00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.670\nSo that's where yes you\nstart seeing separation.\n\n219\n00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.780\nYou start realizing here's\nwhere we need a project.\n\n220\n00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.240\nWe need to actually find\nout what's suitable for us.\n\n221\n00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.860\nSo we started off with an idea and\n\n222\n00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.040\nthat idea was quickly out grown\nto what we really needed.\n\n223\n00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.550\nAnd the good thing is we had\ngood people with us that said,\n\n224\n00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:26.310\nhere's what we really need to move to and\nhere's the product we need to move to.\n\n225\n00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.970\nSo it was easy for us to actually\nknow that's where we needed to move.\n\n226\n00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:34.920\nBut then that's what spawned that project\nof saying, here's how we're gonna\n\n227\n00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:40.720\nmigrate the entire DO VAR database over\nto whatever this new product is gonna be.\n\n228\n00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.990\nSo it may actually just be something\nlike a regular business need as well.\n\n229\n00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.940\n>> Yeah, and\n\n230\n00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.400\none of the types of validation that\nwe have to go through around here, or\n\n231\n00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.120\nthat validates projects that we do a lot\nhere at ITProTV is you, the customer.\n\n232\n00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.086\nYou say hey,\nI wanna see a series on Java, right?\n\n233\n00:11:58.086 --> 00:12:03.390\nOr I wanna see a series on How to\nconnect Cisco routers together.\n\n234\n00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.570\nWell, we listen to that and\nwe go through that.\n\n235\n00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.560\nAnd that's one of the main reasons\nthat we do a lot of projects\n\n236\n00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.220\naround here, right Ronnie?\n\n237\n00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.970\n>> There's no doubt that we end up\nhaving to do a lot of things like that.\n\n238\n00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:16.740\nBecause we are, we're a demand driven\ntype of company that produces our content\n\n239\n00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.230\nas we try and listen to,\nof course, our subscribers.\n\n240\n00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:21.780\nOur family, is what we call them,\nthey're our team members.\n\n241\n00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.400\nWe try and listen to everybody\nthat actually becomes a member for\n\n242\n00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.380\nus to say hey, we really value your input.\n\n243\n00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:30.540\nSo it gives us that opportunity to be able\nto develop the content the way that we\n\n244\n00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.240\nneed, and\nwe get assigned these projects to do so.\n\n245\n00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.650\nBut the other thing that it also did\nis spawned another side project here\n\n246\n00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.170\nwhich was fairly simple.\n\n247\n00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:40.760\nWe knew that we needed a better process.\n\n248\n00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.620\nEssentially people were just\nposting in our Q&A section,\n\n249\n00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.440\nthey were sending us emails.\n\n250\n00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.800\nAnd we were just manually collating them.\n\n251\n00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.910\nAnd man don't get me wrong we did\na pretty good job that we knew where\n\n252\n00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:57.070\nall that stuff had to go but it was five\nor six different email or you know people\n\n253\n00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.320\nessentially taking every single time\nsomebody was requesting something and\n\n254\n00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.830\njust marking it essentially\non an Excel spreadsheet.\n\n255\n00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.060\nI mean that's what it came down to or\n\n256\n00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.060\ntracking it somehow, well that actually\nsaid, alright, we need a better process.\n\n257\n00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.230\nWe need something in which\nthe user can actually use and\n\n258\n00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:14.220\nactually request that\nwithout having to for us,\n\n259\n00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:17.880\nto go through a second step\nbefore we can see that request.\n\n260\n00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.360\nSo this is where our particular\ndevelopment team said look,\n\n261\n00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.130\nwe can actually put up a course\nrequest list or a show request list.\n\n262\n00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:28.680\nAnd then have it collate all the data\nthe way that we need to, so that was\n\n263\n00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:33.070\na different project that also brought that\non due to the idea of a customer request.\n\n264\n00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:36.900\nSo we can see where something like\nthis right, a demand or a request from\n\n265\n00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.820\na customer, if they're really our customer\nand we're supposed to produce for\n\n266\n00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.770\nthem it really does drive a validation\nthat says yes this needs to be done.\n\n267\n00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.110\n>> That's right and that is not the only\nthing, we've got plenty of examples.\n\n268\n00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:51.120\nThere's tons of ways in which\nthe projects can get off the ground.\n\n269\n00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.010\nOne of them, a big one, and especially\nhere in the last, what, maybe 10 or\n\n270\n00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.940\n15 years, has been technological advances.\n\n271\n00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.960\nThat's been the impetus for\nplenty of projects.\n\n272\n00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.110\n>> It definitely has.\n\n273\n00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:06.060\nSo, let's take ITPro, cuz that's the one\nI know about by far, is that, as we grew,\n\n274\n00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.040\nright, the very fact is We\nhad this opportunity and\n\n275\n00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.900\nthis chance to keep everything right here.\n\n276\n00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.500\nWe could have bought our own\ninfrastructure, our storage, and\n\n277\n00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.050\nbuilt everything up here and\nwe had talked about that.\n\n278\n00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.550\nHey, this is the amount of money\nwe're going to have to invest and\n\n279\n00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.880\ndo something like that right here, but\n\n280\n00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.620\nthen we started realizing something that,\nas much money as we can invest in here.\n\n281\n00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.520\nThe problem that we have then is that\nwe have to actually make sure that we\n\n282\n00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.860\nupkeep all of that equipment, that we have\nto be able to end of life that equipment,\n\n283\n00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.480\nthat we have to roll in new equipment,\nmanage all that stuff and\n\n284\n00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.450\nthe infrastructure and everything.\n\n285\n00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:42.380\nAnd then that's when we start actually\nplaying around with something like AWS,\n\n286\n00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:46.830\nthe Amazon Web Services, and started\nlooking for different cloud solutions.\n\n287\n00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.315\nThe Cloud solutions became a little bit\nmore viable at that point because we don't\n\n288\n00:14:50.315 --> 00:14:52.130\nhave to take care of the equipment.\n\n289\n00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.780\nWe essentially pay for those services and\n\n290\n00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.770\nthey are the ones that are responsible for\nup keeping that.\n\n291\n00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:00.420\nWe're still responsible for the management\nof everything that we do but\n\n292\n00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.760\nthat's when we make that decision.\n\n293\n00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.720\nIs that actually a worthy project and\n\n294\n00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.370\nthe very fact it's\na technological advance right?\n\n295\n00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:10.150\nIs that we could build everything\nthe way that we knew how to do it but\n\n296\n00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.910\nthen we thought that hey,\nthis is an opportunity where\n\n297\n00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:16.500\nwe can depend on redundancy of\ncompanies that provide redundancy.\n\n298\n00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.700\nWe can depend on companies that are used\nto being on the backbone of the internet\n\n299\n00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.650\nand not us to be able to provide\neverything instead of us going okay so\n\n300\n00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.390\nwhat kind of internet service\nprovider are we going to need?\n\n301\n00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:27.600\nWhat else are we going to need here?\n\n302\n00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.930\nWhat's all the stuff that\nwe need centralized here?\n\n303\n00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.860\nWe decided instead to actually\napproach it from a Cloud solution.\n\n304\n00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:37.650\nBecause the technology advanced and then,\nthe cost and benefit element of it.\n\n305\n00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:40.640\nOnce we actually took everything\ninto consideration here.\n\n306\n00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.715\nBut technological advance is a great\nway to drive whether you need changes.\n\n307\n00:15:43.715 --> 00:15:48.476\nOur move actually from, once again, the\nidea of the tricaster to our graph valley\n\n308\n00:15:48.476 --> 00:15:53.099\nGB director Is one of those reasons to\nlove the technological advance that we saw\n\n309\n00:15:53.099 --> 00:15:57.666\nwith the Greenhouse Valley and that's\nwhy we also chose that project as well.\n\n310\n00:15:57.666 --> 00:16:01.727\nSo that can also drive that existence,\nor that project into existence too,\n\n311\n00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:04.773\nis that there is some advantage\nthat we need to go ahead and\n\n312\n00:16:04.773 --> 00:16:08.530\ntake ahold of now before being caught\nbehind the eight-ball with it.\n\n313\n00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:09.910\n>> Yeah that's exactly right.\n\n314\n00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:15.510\nNow there's also some outside\ninfluences that can get a project or\n\n315\n00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.040\nbe the demand for creating a project.\n\n316\n00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.039\nNow you might think, well a customer.\n\n317\n00:16:19.039 --> 00:16:19.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, but\n\n318\n00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.190\nit's still within the sphere\nof your business.\n\n319\n00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.850\nSometimes this is completely tertiary or\nunrelated.\n\n320\n00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.380\nIt could just be the fact\nthat laws change, or\n\n321\n00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.170\nnew laws come into existence and\nnow all of the sudden you find yourself in\n\n322\n00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:35.810\nthe middle of having to scramble to\nbecome legally compliant, right Ronnie?\n\n323\n00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.920\n>> That is probably one of the biggest\nissues that we will always face.\n\n324\n00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.570\nAnytime that a business actually does have\nsomething that the government regulates,\n\n325\n00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.220\nyou are going to realize there is gonna\nbe something that you have to change\n\n326\n00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.160\nand follow.\n\n327\n00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:54.360\nIt may be as simple as things like\nthe OSHA requirements here in the states.\n\n328\n00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.660\nThe occupational safety and health.\n\n329\n00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.650\nAdministration in order, making sure\nthat people are safe on the worksite.\n\n330\n00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:03.200\nIt may actually even be certain other\nthings like if you're actually in\n\n331\n00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.830\na chemical environment, what are the\nhazmat rules, whatever it might be.\n\n332\n00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:10.700\nThat you might actually have to have\nsomebody onsite instead that comes in and\n\n333\n00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.810\nmonitors it or licenses it,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n334\n00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:17.980\nLegal requirements are another one that\nactually requires us to make a change.\n\n335\n00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.360\nWe might realize that we cant make\nthe change in the way that we are, so\n\n336\n00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.550\nwe actually have to make the project\nthat says, here is how we get ourselves\n\n337\n00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.860\ninto a compliance, or here is how me\nmake sure we are in compliance for\n\n338\n00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:31.670\nthe future, because of the way\nthe regulations actually are.\n\n339\n00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:32.830\nIt is a big thing.\n\n340\n00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:35.840\nThere is no doubt that this is something\nthat we don't like to deal with\n\n341\n00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.070\na lot of times.\n\n342\n00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:41.130\nBut the very fact is, it is something that\nactually demands that a project might\n\n343\n00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:44.210\nactually be created for\nus to make sure that we are in compliance.\n\n344\n00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:44.750\n>> That's right.\n\n345\n00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:49.120\nNow other outside factors can also include\nthings like social responsibility,\n\n346\n00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:54.140\nor even environmental impact from your\nbusiness to the rest of the world, because\n\n347\n00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:59.090\nwe're kinda reaching into other people's\ngravisphere or whatever you wanna call it.\n\n348\n00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:02.895\nI impact you if I'm dumping toxic waste\nout the back side of my building.\n\n349\n00:18:02.895 --> 00:18:03.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's gonna impact\n\n350\n00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:07.790\neverybody around me,\nnot just my one little business.\n\n351\n00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.390\nThese are things that can\ndefinitely get you a project going.\n\n352\n00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:14.418\n>> There's no doubt that this is something\nwe do have to actually be wary of.\n\n353\n00:18:14.418 --> 00:18:18.595\nIt does fall underneath that idea of\nregulations a lot of times, but remember\n\n354\n00:18:18.595 --> 00:18:22.899\nthat if our business does have some type\nof ecological impact to it, that we have\n\n355\n00:18:22.899 --> 00:18:27.271\nto actually account for, well may mean\nthat somebody is actually watching us and\n\n356\n00:18:27.271 --> 00:18:32.200\nreporting us and doing things, we may have\nto change the way that we think on things.\n\n357\n00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.650\nBut it also comes from a social need like\nwhat Daniel's talking about it is not so\n\n358\n00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:40.150\nmuch that you don't care\nabout the environment,\n\n359\n00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:44.170\nbut as far as benefits go,\nif this is a PR disaster for you,\n\n360\n00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.200\nits something you might\njust want to take care of.\n\n361\n00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.770\nThe very fact is that it might drive you,\nso that you do have\n\n362\n00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:52.080\nsomething out there that says this is\nwhat we are trying to do to prevent.\n\n363\n00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.170\nAnything else from happening and so\n\n364\n00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:59.120\nsome companies actually do take\ngreat responsibility for this.\n\n365\n00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:03.860\nOne of the local breweries that we got\nto take a tour of one day actually\n\n366\n00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:07.170\nsaid that what they did is that they not\nonly bought their site but they went and\n\n367\n00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:12.710\nbought I think like another 100 acres and\nkept that as a wetlands ,so that no\n\n368\n00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:16.760\none else could actually develop on it then\nthey were never planning on doing that.\n\n369\n00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.820\nWell that may be their own\n\n370\n00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.490\necological view on things which\nis perfectly fine for them.\n\n371\n00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.390\nBut what they're saying is that\nthey're taking responsibility for\n\n372\n00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.980\nkeeping that undeveloped in\nthe way that they want to.\n\n373\n00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.870\nAnd that gives them what great PR and\nit actually allows them to be able to say\n\n374\n00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:35.170\nlook we're keeping the environment\nas pristine as possible and\n\n375\n00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:39.300\nthe way that we believe that it would\nbe responsible for us to do so.\n\n376\n00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.210\nSo you may actually have some\ntypes of projects like that and so\n\n377\n00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.780\na great example of this one within\nthe last couple of weeks or\n\n378\n00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.670\ncouple of months for\nus here in the United States, and\n\n379\n00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:51.260\nif you've been reading about it,\nis that there's a city right here, right?\n\n380\n00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.670\nFlint, Michigan.\n\n381\n00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:54.160\nThey churned the water supply and\n\n382\n00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:58.460\nit ended up adding in additional\nlead into their pipes coming in.\n\n383\n00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.640\nAnd you might think about something\nlike that, but the very fact is\n\n384\n00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.800\nnow that that water system is\ncontaminated, well what do you do?\n\n385\n00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.980\nThat city needs to actually\nhave a project that says,\n\n386\n00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.390\nwe've gotta figure out how to remove\nthis stuff, what is the cost to it?\n\n387\n00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:13.620\nYou say at some point you gotta go,\nit doesn't matter what the cost is.\n\n388\n00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:17.490\nThis is people drinking lead in their\nwaters, we've gotta to do this,\n\n389\n00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:23.640\nit's gotta be done, and so sometimes\nit is that ecological type of impact.\n\n390\n00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.850\nSometimes it is that idea,\nthe social need.\n\n391\n00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:28.610\nOne of the examples I like to\nmention as far as a social need and\n\n392\n00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:30.840\nresponsibility is something\nlike Mercedes-Benz.\n\n393\n00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.550\nThey were the ones that came up with\nthe idea of the anti-lock braking system.\n\n394\n00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:37.480\nThey absolutely developed\nit back in the 70s.\n\n395\n00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.900\nA guy that worked and everything.\n\n396\n00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.020\nBut then came a point when they could\nhave patented that entire idea.\n\n397\n00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.860\nJust look the only people that can\nactually ever put their anti lock brakes\n\n398\n00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.642\non their systems are is what?\n\n399\n00:20:48.642 --> 00:20:50.080\nIs Mercedes-Benz and\n\n400\n00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.180\nthe rest of us would still be driving\naround with brakes locked up.\n\n401\n00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.584\n[CROSSTALK] put the brakes and\neverything that you can.\n\n402\n00:20:56.584 --> 00:20:58.930\nBut at some point they said look.\n\n403\n00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:02.010\nThis is the responsibility\nof us as a company to\n\n404\n00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:05.880\nsay look we need this technology to be out\nthere cuz it makes it safer for everyone.\n\n405\n00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:11.560\nAnd so you do have even those companies\nthat show hey this is a reason for\n\n406\n00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.520\nus to actually, not only developing this,\n\n407\n00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.785\nbut even having a project to release\nthis to the rest of the entire industry.\n\n408\n00:21:17.785 --> 00:21:19.710\nCuz they didn't just go alright it's free,\n\n409\n00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:24.590\nthey really had to actually go here's how\nwe do everything, here's how you do this.\n\n410\n00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:27.700\nThey had to actually make project teams\nthat show here's the technology and\n\n411\n00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.580\nhere's how it actually works.\n\n412\n00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.950\nSo a lot of things can actually\ndrive us into that existence.\n\n413\n00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:34.160\nBut these are kinda\nthe basic ones we have here.\n\n414\n00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.760\nSo those seven areas, let's go ahead and\n\n415\n00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.040\ntake a look at them as a list again,\nvery briefly here.\n\n416\n00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.120\nThose seven areas are actually the ones\nthat are actually very important for\n\n417\n00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.490\nus to focus in on.\n\n418\n00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:47.340\nAnd what we did here is we just gave\nyou an example of each one of those ,so\n\n419\n00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:51.600\njust take a look and think about some of\nthe ways that you might see examples,\n\n420\n00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.810\nin you're own way of actually\ntaking a look at the world.\n\n421\n00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:57.300\nWhy these needs might\nalso come into existence.\n\n422\n00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:02.360\nNow once we have that business need\nright it could be that that is enough to\n\n423\n00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:07.000\ngive you a basis and a solid foundation of\nsaying this one actually exists but a lot\n\n424\n00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.660\nof times what stakeholders are looking for\nis the benefits of the project ,okay.\n\n425\n00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.800\nBenefits of course like\nwe said can be social,\n\n426\n00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.760\nit can be intangible at times the very\nfact that actually might produce good will\n\n427\n00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.240\nsometimes it can be\noutright just financial.\n\n428\n00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:22.760\nOkay.\n\n429\n00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.950\nSo just to find the existence of\nthe project can come in many ways,\n\n430\n00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.050\nusually from the results of it.\n\n431\n00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:31.690\nThe key for you though,\nas a project manager, is can you do it?\n\n432\n00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:35.030\nCan you actually show or tell or\n\n433\n00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:39.510\nbe able to tell the story that you need\nto to give that justification for it?\n\n434\n00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:40.740\nIs not always easy.\n\n435\n00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.590\nBut if you can do that, and\nyou get people on your side,\n\n436\n00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:47.020\nthat is one of the first\nthings that can really happen.\n\n437\n00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:52.800\nSometimes though, people and stakeholders\ndon't really take the idea too well.\n\n438\n00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.560\nThey can take a look at any of those\nbusiness needs that we're taking a look\n\n439\n00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.270\nat, they can look at the justifications\nand go I still don't see it and\n\n440\n00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:02.990\nthat's because what they're looking for\nis hard facts, okay.\n\n441\n00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:05.440\nAnd what that means is some\ntype of feasibility study.\n\n442\n00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:11.740\nThe idea of the feasibility study, right\nis does that project, can it be viable.\n\n443\n00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.130\nAnd that means can you sustain it?\n\n444\n00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:18.210\nYou may find out something that your small\ncompany can't sustain the project scope\n\n445\n00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:22.420\nthat Daniel says no, this how big it has\nto be, this is how grand it has to be.\n\n446\n00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.240\nAnd you go well, we're only three people.\n\n447\n00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.130\nI don't think we can do it.\n\n448\n00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.100\nAnd I go no, we can do it.\n\n449\n00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.770\nWell is there a viable need.\n\n450\n00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:31.670\nYou do actually different\ntypes of feasibility studies\n\n451\n00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:34.620\nto be able to take a look there as well.\n\n452\n00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:39.190\nAlso of course at this point, this is\nwhere you have to take into account\n\n453\n00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.900\nhigh levels of complexity and risk.\n\n454\n00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.230\nIn other words, can you validate that?\n\n455\n00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:44.600\nCan you actually be able to explain that.\n\n456\n00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.300\nThat's why I said,\nwell what are the risks.\n\n457\n00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.460\nYou don't go well, I don't know.\n\n458\n00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.152\nI haven't thought about it.\nWell,\n\n459\n00:23:48.152 --> 00:23:51.783\nthat feasibility study has now just gone\ndown the drain cuz nobody else wants to\n\n460\n00:23:51.783 --> 00:23:52.289\ndo it now.\n\n461\n00:23:52.289 --> 00:23:52.974\nCuz they're like,\n\n462\n00:23:52.974 --> 00:23:55.690\nwell Daniel you just haven't actually\ntaken the time to take a look at the risk.\n\n463\n00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:59.572\nYou know, and take a look at the overall\ncomplexity so why should we consider it?\n\n464\n00:23:59.572 --> 00:24:01.330\nMakes sense here.\n\n465\n00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:05.540\nSo, just realize you may be asked these\ntypes of questions as well, okay?\n\n466\n00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.760\nAnd, lastly of course does it go in\nline with our strategic plan is it\n\n467\n00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.790\nsomething we should do or\nsomething we shouldn't?\n\n468\n00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:15.250\nIt actually comes down to what our\nbusiness is going to be about.\n\n469\n00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:18.770\nYou may find out that it doesn't actually\nfit into the overall strategic plan.\n\n470\n00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.790\nThat doesn't, you tend to drop it, but\n\n471\n00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:24.220\nif it does you need to show people that\nwondering like, where does it fit in.\n\n472\n00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:29.009\nYou need to show them exactly where it\nfits at is pretty much were we want to\n\n473\n00:24:29.009 --> 00:24:30.746\nactually be here, okay?\n\n474\n00:24:30.746 --> 00:24:34.924\nSo being out to do all of that\nis actually very important for\n\n475\n00:24:34.924 --> 00:24:37.410\nus because we do need a value this.\n\n476\n00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:40.050\nThere has to be a way that we\ncould document all this stuff and\n\n477\n00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:42.740\nnot just because Daniel said\nhe just wanted to do it.\n\n478\n00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.430\nHow is it?\nAnd that should be enough of-\n\n479\n00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:45.510\n>> Pet projects maybe.\n\n480\n00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:49.420\n>> Yeah pet projects is pretty much\nkey for everybody but the very fact is\n\n481\n00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:52.370\nwhen you start spending millions of\ndollars pet projects become expensive and\n\n482\n00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.540\nyou go, that's what it produced?\n\n483\n00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:58.180\n>> Because it's cool, usually isn't\na great validation for your project.\n\n484\n00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.735\n>> At least not to\nthe majority of people here.\n\n485\n00:25:00.735 --> 00:25:01.918\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, there you go.\n\n486\n00:25:01.918 --> 00:25:03.270\nNow our last thing of course,\n\n487\n00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:06.460\nwhen we talk about validating the project\nis making sure that you understand,\n\n488\n00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.440\nyou are doing this for\nyour stakeholders more than anything else.\n\n489\n00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.020\nYour primary stakeholders of course\nare going to be the project sponsor.\n\n490\n00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.190\nAnd the project manager here.\n\n491\n00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:22.770\nThe sponsor's the one who authorizes\nthe actual beginning of that project.\n\n492\n00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:25.580\nSo he needs to be able to see that you've\nactually thought about this stuff and\n\n493\n00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:30.750\nthat you can validate what you actually\nsay here you as a project manager.\n\n494\n00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:36.940\nNow remember that stakeholders\nhere can also be individuals.\n\n495\n00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.990\nBut it can also be complete organizations\nor even complete departments, and\n\n496\n00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:43.180\nthis is where it gets a little bit tricky.\n\n497\n00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.890\nThere are departmental politics.\n\n498\n00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:50.170\nThere are individuals that hold more sway\nand power than you realize, and you've got\n\n499\n00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:53.380\nto be able to identify who they are and\nactually be able to analyze that, too.\n\n500\n00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.260\nAnd that means do you know\nthat they're for you, or\n\n501\n00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.010\ndo you know that they're against you?\n\n502\n00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:01.730\nPart of project validation is actually\nunderstanding what forces are against you,\n\n503\n00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:03.070\nand what forces are for\n\n504\n00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:06.700\nyou, and if somebody asks,\nhow are you gonna overcome that?\n\n505\n00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:09.380\nDaniel, how are you gonna overcome the\nvery fact that Megan doesn't really want\n\n506\n00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.670\nyou doing that project?\n\n507\n00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:13.530\nAnd you might go well I don't know yet and\nyou might actually have to think that out\n\n508\n00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.370\nbefore you do something like that as well,\nokay?\n\n509\n00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:19.140\nAnd remember anybody who has\na vested interest in that project,\n\n510\n00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.710\nyou pretty much want on\nyour side if you can.\n\n511\n00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:25.190\nNow that doesn't mean that you\nhave to kowtow to everybody.\n\n512\n00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.890\nBut it means that as a project manager\nyou understand what you're facing.\n\n513\n00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:32.630\nYou understand who's\nactually on your side and\n\n514\n00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:37.540\nwho's not and can you overcome that or\ncan you not overcome that.\n\n515\n00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.320\nWell that's where the skills of\nbeing a project manager come in.\n\n516\n00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.340\nLeadership, negotiation, being a coach.\n\n517\n00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:44.735\n>> In walks office politics.\n\n518\n00:26:44.735 --> 00:26:46.060\n[LAUGH]\n>> In walks office politics and\n\n519\n00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:48.460\nyou've gotta be willing to\nplay at times to get it done.\n\n520\n00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.700\n>> Yeah, it's just a part of\nbeing in project management,\n\n521\n00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.150\nyou have to get people on your side,\nthere's always gonna be\n\n522\n00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:58.190\nnaysayers that don't think that what\nyou're doing is beneficial to the company.\n\n523\n00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:02.990\nAnd part of your job is kinda selling\nyour projects because you believe and\n\n524\n00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:05.920\nthat you think that it's gonna be\nbeneficial to the company that,\n\n525\n00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.260\nthat's gonna be right to hit on that.\n\n526\n00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.700\nWe said that it was a,\nwhat is the benefit of the company, right?\n\n527\n00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:12.547\nAnd usually,\n\n528\n00:27:12.547 --> 00:27:17.110\nit comes down to the bottom line like\nthe do-re-mi is gonna make us money.\n\n529\n00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:19.110\nMonetization is always a great\n\n530\n00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.960\nway to get people\n>> Validated.\n\n531\n00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:20.610\n>> On your side, that's right.\n\n532\n00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:23.150\nThat's gonna validate that\nproject really quick.\n\n533\n00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.505\nAnd then you can start dipping\ninto the social, well,\n\n534\n00:27:25.505 --> 00:27:30.150\nwe're gonna be socially impacting people\nof diverse cultures and such and such.\n\n535\n00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:34.073\nYou find the outlying good, the intriszik\ngood that goes along with the project and\n\n536\n00:27:34.073 --> 00:27:36.383\nthat's gonna help that\nmove that along as well.\n\n537\n00:27:36.383 --> 00:27:39.978\nThere's a lot of different ways in which\nyou can get your project validated and\n\n538\n00:27:39.978 --> 00:27:41.787\nhelp get the down to a minimum.\n\n539\n00:27:41.787 --> 00:27:45.598\n>> Well, Daniel, that's pretty much\neverything that we wanted to make sure\n\n540\n00:27:45.598 --> 00:27:49.080\nthat we covered here on talking\nabout validating a project.\n\n541\n00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:52.330\nDon't skip over this stuff just\nbecause you go, that's easy stuff.\n\n542\n00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:57.070\nMake sure that you can identify and be\nable to say hey, that's a good example of\n\n543\n00:27:57.070 --> 00:28:00.100\none of these different project\nneeds as you're facing the exam.\n\n544\n00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.280\nIt's really gonna help you out but\n\n545\n00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:05.250\nreviewing these processes in\npart of the pre project set up\n\n546\n00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:07.890\nis also gonna help you to be\na better project manager as well.\n\n547\n00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:09.830\n>> Wise words from Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n548\n00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.980\nThank you so much for\njoining us today, Ronnie and\n\n549\n00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:15.430\nexplaining how we can get our projects\nvalidated, what the process is that we\n\n550\n00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:20.750\nwould want to go through to make sure that\neverybody's on board with our projects.\n\n551\n00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:22.969\nHopefully not pet projects.\n[LAUGH] That being said, thanks again for\n\n552\n00:28:22.969 --> 00:28:25.740\njoining us today, Ronnie,\nand thank you for watching.\n\n553\n00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.450\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n554\n00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:29.130\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n555\n00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:32.654\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n556\n00:28:32.654 --> 00:28:33.340\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.799 --> 00:00:19.583\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:22.000\nwell we'll continuing on\nwith Project+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.360\nJoining us back in the studio\nagain today is our good friend and\n\n6\n00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.320\nmentor, Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.040\nRonnie, welcome back to the show,\nsir, how you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.610\n>> I do appreciate being invited back as\nwe continue on to take a look at more of\n\n9\n00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.400\nthe CompTIA Project+ series.\n\n10\n00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.250\nAnd what we've been doing is we've taken a\nlook of course at the pre-project setup in\n\n11\n00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.153\nprevious episodes that we've had, and now\nwe're going back and we're actually kind\n\n12\n00:00:42.153 --> 00:00:45.548\nof diving a little bit more in depth\non each of those different components.\n\n13\n00:00:45.548 --> 00:00:49.719\nAnd bringing that into play the way that\nwe need to, to get us ready, not only for,\n\n14\n00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.953\nof course, project management things that\nwe have to do as people actually heading\n\n15\n00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:56.794\ninto different projects, but\nalso for preparation for\n\n16\n00:00:56.794 --> 00:01:00.725\nthat exam that you might actually choose\nto take if you're actually into that\n\n17\n00:01:00.725 --> 00:01:03.410\nprofessional level certification thing.\n\n18\n00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.020\nWell, we all are, let's face it, okay?\n\n19\n00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.040\nSo that's what we're also doing.\n\n20\n00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.460\nNow today what were gonna take a look at\nin this particular episode is we’re gonna\n\n21\n00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.810\ntalk about that project charter.\n\n22\n00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.420\nNow the project charter, we've\nmentioned it in previous episodes, so\n\n23\n00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.090\nyou can go back there and see where\nwe kind of hit it as an overview.\n\n24\n00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.649\nWe didn't really try to dive super deep\ninto it, but we did show you an example,\n\n25\n00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.156\nand we showed you the most important\npart of a project charter, essentially,\n\n26\n00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:30.399\nis to get it signed, okay?\n\n27\n00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.469\nBut that doesn't mean that that's all\n[LAUGH] that there is in a project charter\n\n28\n00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.130\nis just somebody's signature.\n\n29\n00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.090\nIt would not actually be something\nthat anybody would wanna sign and\n\n30\n00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.980\nsay, what are these blank\nsheets of paper and\n\n31\n00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.860\nwhy do you have a signature at the end for\nme to sign, Ronnie?\n\n32\n00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.420\n[LAUGH] What's all this stuff here that's\nsupposed to be filled in but you don't?\n\n33\n00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.600\nSo we can't do that,\nwe actually have to know what goes\n\n34\n00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.742\ninto the idea of the project charter, and\nremember that whole goal, right, behind\n\n35\n00:01:54.742 --> 00:01:59.740\nwhat we're actually taking of course is to\nget authorization for what we want to do.\n\n36\n00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.340\nSo today we're gonna take a look at what\nare the different components that we have\n\n37\n00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.010\ninside of a project charter,\n\n38\n00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.960\nand we're gonna talk about them\na little bit more in depth.\n\n39\n00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.010\nNow depending on your experience level,\nokay, and also dependent on whether or\n\n40\n00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.420\nnot you actually work for\ndifferent types of organizations,\n\n41\n00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.960\nyou might see these things that I'm\ngonna talk about in general topics,\n\n42\n00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.580\nyou might go, well I don't do that.\n\n43\n00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.448\nWell remember that if you're in the IT\nindustry, you may actually bypass some of\n\n44\n00:02:26.448 --> 00:02:28.850\nthese topics and\nactually insert your own in there.\n\n45\n00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.090\nAnd if you're actually into\nthe construction industry you may have all\n\n46\n00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.020\nthese topics and you may go, we don't talk\nabout any of those other things there,\n\n47\n00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.485\nthe only thing we really\ncare about is this.\n\n48\n00:02:36.485 --> 00:02:39.250\nThat's perfectly fine, but\nwhat we're going through is\n\n49\n00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.870\nkind of the ones that you're gonna end\nup seeing more than likely, right,\n\n50\n00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.370\nas if you are preparing for\nthe exam and what elements that\n\n51\n00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.350\nCompTIA essentially says that need to be\ninvolved in building a project charter.\n\n52\n00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.800\nSo that's where really\nwe're focusing in on.\n\n53\n00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.990\nSo don't go back and sit there and go,\nwell dang, here's my project charter,\n\n54\n00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.770\nRonnie had more than this in here,\nlet me go and add stuff in.\n\n55\n00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.490\nAnd all of a sudden people are like,\nwhy did you add in all this stuff here?\n\n56\n00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.610\nYou don't have to do that, right?\n\n57\n00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.190\nSo remember that your industry may\nactually be a little bit different, and\n\n58\n00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.810\nthat's something for\nall of us to consider.\n\n59\n00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.350\nAnd the reason, again, is that even\nthough we're talking about it,\n\n60\n00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.608\nright, there's no rules.\n\n61\n00:03:16.608 --> 00:03:20.390\nI know that's kind of a weird thing, it's\nnot like baseball where there's specific\n\n62\n00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.760\nrules, the fouls and\nouts and everything else.\n\n63\n00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.620\nAnd the idea of project management,\n\n64\n00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.660\nthe only thing that's actually out\nthere are really a set of guidelines.\n\n65\n00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.740\nEven professional project managers will\ntell you, yeah, those are good guidelines,\n\n66\n00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.870\nbut they don't necessarily actually\nfit in every single situation.\n\n67\n00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.200\nYou have to kinda massage and\nmodify them the way that you want.\n\n68\n00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.942\nAnd that's kind of also something that\nkey, that you'll learn about with more and\n\n69\n00:03:43.942 --> 00:03:47.164\nmore experience, that you may see\nthat that's what's gonna happen.\n\n70\n00:03:47.164 --> 00:03:51.736\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at some\nof the basic most generic components that\n\n71\n00:03:51.736 --> 00:03:56.540\nwe have in store when we talk about what\nshould be inside of a project charter.\n\n72\n00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.570\nSo I went ahead and\n\n73\n00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.357\njust kind of listed right here just\nsome of the most basic things.\n\n74\n00:04:01.357 --> 00:04:03.665\nAnd let me kinda zoom in\njust a little bit more and\n\n75\n00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:06.510\nthat way we can kind of see\nthat a little bit better.\n\n76\n00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.770\nAs different components here,\n\n77\n00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.250\nand you see that I actually have six\ndifferent categories when we start talking\n\n78\n00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.318\nabout what we normally include\ninside of a project charter.\n\n79\n00:04:15.318 --> 00:04:18.450\nThe first one's actually\na fairly simple idea,\n\n80\n00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.550\nbut it is one that gets overlooked because\n\n81\n00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.950\nthe project charter normally is gonna end\nup in some type of written result, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.270\nSo in other words,\na document of some type of format.\n\n83\n00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.150\nBut what we wanna make sure that we\nunderstand from the very beginning,\n\n84\n00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.410\neven in written form, is what is gonna be\nour general project management approach.\n\n85\n00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.340\nThis comes down to style\nmore than anything else.\n\n86\n00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.560\nNow, Dan and I, we've talked about\nthis before in previous episodes, and\n\n87\n00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.830\nwe mentioned some of these just briefly.\n\n88\n00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.780\nWe can be the project dictator.\n\n89\n00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.904\nNow, Dan, what do you think\nabout when you hear about that,\n\n90\n00:04:53.904 --> 00:04:55.830\nthat somebody says that\nthey're a project dictator?\n\n91\n00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.493\n>> Man, I think a project\ndictator is awesomely bad.\n\n92\n00:04:59.493 --> 00:05:02.650\n[LAUGH] That's not something\nyou wanna get into doing.\n\n93\n00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.690\nA project manager, the dictatorship\nwhere someone is just from high saying,\n\n94\n00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.380\nyou will do this and you will do that.\n\n95\n00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.750\nThey're basically controlling\nevery aspect of the project.\n\n96\n00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.560\nAnd that really, to me it stymies\nperformance, it stymies creativity,\n\n97\n00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.810\nit stymies the project from moving\nforward, to be honest with you,\n\n98\n00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.410\nbecause every little detail has to be\nunder the microscope of the dictator and\n\n99\n00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.205\nfollowing their exact orders, and if you\ndon't you gotta go back and do it again.\n\n100\n00:05:29.205 --> 00:05:34.060\nAnd it's hard for\na third person to interpret\n\n101\n00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.430\nanother person's ideas, get it exactly\nright, it's just a bad way to go.\n\n102\n00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.010\n>> There is no doubt, and a lot of times\nwhere it actually turns into even though\n\n103\n00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.370\nI think about dictators that\nI think about in the past and\n\n104\n00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.100\nstuff like that,\n>> And that's what my notion comes into,\n\n105\n00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.220\nbut the way that Daniel described\nit if you listened to him,\n\n106\n00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.710\nit really sounds like a micro-manager,\nright?\n\n107\n00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.280\nThat's what it really sounds like.\n\n108\n00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.210\nAnd so sometimes you might be able to\nfind out during that conversation or\n\n109\n00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.120\nas you're actually reading that, right?\n\n110\n00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.700\nHow do I want this project to go?\n\n111\n00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.000\nWell if you're the project manager you're\nprobably the true initiator right now,\n\n112\n00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.753\nor you're probably actually the prime\nmover in the way that this project's\n\n113\n00:06:09.753 --> 00:06:10.919\nactually getting formed.\n\n114\n00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.669\nAnd so you might actually just pen that\ndown as saying, here's what I want to be\n\n115\n00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:19.790\nable to do, and you might find yourself\nactually being that micro-manager instead,\n\n116\n00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.520\nand realizing that hey, when I take a look\nat this, my general approach seems to be\n\n117\n00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.800\nmore micromanagement than it\nseems to be doing anything else.\n\n118\n00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.730\nWell that's a bad thing for a project\noverall, but we need to establish that.\n\n119\n00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.850\nWe've also heard the idea here that a lot\nof times that the position of that project\n\n120\n00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.120\nmanager may actually be the one\nthat actually comes in and\n\n121\n00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.710\ncoaches the situation instead, and\n\n122\n00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.100\nthat's actually more of a key element\nthat you may end up find out.\n\n123\n00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.210\nNow remember that this also\ngoes by people's personalities.\n\n124\n00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.110\nThey may find out that look, when we're\nunder great deadlines we want that\n\n125\n00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.950\nparticular project dictator to come in and\njust ensure that everything happens.\n\n126\n00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.690\nBut when you do that remember that\nthe morale of the team might end up going\n\n127\n00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:59.710\ndown a little bit.\n\n128\n00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.565\nBut the coach is actually\nwho we tend to want.\n\n129\n00:07:02.565 --> 00:07:05.670\nSo just kinda realize that we wanna\nmake sure that that element is actually\n\n130\n00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.760\nincluded in there, to make sure that we\nidentify the actual management skills and\n\n131\n00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.910\nprocesses right away, and how we expect to\nbe able to manage this particular project.\n\n132\n00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.910\nYou do also have to take into\nconsideration the idea of remote\n\n133\n00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.910\nmanagement as well.\n\n134\n00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.530\nNormally though in very big\ngigantic projects, right, and\n\n135\n00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:29.310\nI mean large like the ones that\nare building bridges between islands and\n\n136\n00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.150\nstuff like that, usually the project\nmanager is gonna move out there, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.689\nHe's not gonna be sitting in an office\nover here in a high rise somewhere and\n\n138\n00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:39.240\nthen go, yeah, I can manage it from here.\n\n139\n00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.260\nHe's literally gonna move over there.\n\n140\n00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.230\nBut there are times where you may actually\nhave to manage portions of the project\n\n141\n00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.220\nremotely.\n\n142\n00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.512\nAnd you have to understand what is\ngoing to be your management style,\n\n143\n00:07:49.512 --> 00:07:51.100\nnot only right there on site, but\n\n144\n00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.084\nwhat about those people that you\nreally have no control over.\n\n145\n00:07:54.084 --> 00:07:57.683\nSo let's take, for example, that Daniel's\nactually leading a development team.\n\n146\n00:07:57.683 --> 00:08:01.445\nBut he's here in Gainesville, but\nmy office is, let's say, in Miami.\n\n147\n00:08:01.445 --> 00:08:05.769\nWell, there could be that Daniel's team\nstarts to fall behind, well that's my\n\n148\n00:08:05.769 --> 00:08:09.950\nresponsibility as the project\nmanager to get things back on track.\n\n149\n00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:13.080\nAnd Daniel may go, well you know, I\nnoticed that you're actually over there so\n\n150\n00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.070\nyou don't really have time for us.\n\n151\n00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.540\nDaniel could actually take his team and\nlead it whatever way he wants to.\n\n152\n00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.940\nWell what is your approach to even\nthose remote management things,\n\n153\n00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.230\nthat have to happen?\n\n154\n00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.700\nAll that has to be defined right here, and\n\n155\n00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:30.810\nshould be included in the project\nmanagement charter itself is your big\n\n156\n00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:35.220\ngeneral approach to the idea\nof this project manager.\n\n157\n00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:39.960\nSo just kind of remember that,\nthis is all about your management style.\n\n158\n00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.300\nNow, everybody loves to think\nthat they are great coaches and\n\n159\n00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.110\nI will admit something.\n\n160\n00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.900\nI coached high school baseball for\na year, I am not a great coach.\n\n161\n00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.500\nI like to be able to say all right,\nlet's think about it this way, but overall\n\n162\n00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.780\nthough, when it came down to it with high\nschool kids, you have to actually be more\n\n163\n00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.210\nof a dictator cuz they don't really think\nabout strategy and how everything ends up\n\n164\n00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.650\nplaying out a lot of times,\nyou have to actually tell them what to do.\n\n165\n00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.940\nBut in a professional\nproject management team,\n\n166\n00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.580\nmore than likely you're not the direct\nmanager or functional manager of anything\n\n167\n00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.730\nbut you're the one that actually has to\nmake sure that still things get done.\n\n168\n00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.020\nSo you need to make sure that your project\nmanagement style is gonna be clear\n\n169\n00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.532\ncuz this particular document is gonna be\nimportant one day when somebody says,\n\n170\n00:09:22.532 --> 00:09:25.110\nall right but you said you wouldn't do\nthis Ronnie, you should have said you\n\n171\n00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.220\nwouldn't micromanage us and\nnow you're micromanaging.\n\n172\n00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.090\nSo just realize, we need to set\nthis up at the very beginning here.\n\n173\n00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:35.900\nSo that's one of the key elements that\nwe really want to take a look at.\n\n174\n00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.820\nAnother one of course is just\nthe problem statement and\n\n175\n00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.390\nyou'll hear that in some\nof the different ways here.\n\n176\n00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:45.080\nAnd this normally means it's\nabout the project itself.\n\n177\n00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:50.340\nWhat is it that we are trying\nto solve with this project?\n\n178\n00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.900\nIs it what we've talked about as\nfar as why the project exists,\n\n179\n00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.650\nbefore we've talked about business needs,\nwe've talked about internal\n\n180\n00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.420\nbusiness needs, we've talked about\nall of the different things.\n\n181\n00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.320\nBut a lot of times there\nare actually different questions\n\n182\n00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.040\nthat our project charter\nshould be able to answer.\n\n183\n00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.820\nSo let's go ahead and even write\nout a few of these questions here.\n\n184\n00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:14.660\nWhy do we need this project?\n\n185\n00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.750\nRemember that this is actually\na key part because a lot of times\n\n186\n00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.290\ndepending on the way that you're\nactually gonna be a project manager for\n\n187\n00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:25.790\nsomething like this, remember that there's\nanother project manager that may be\n\n188\n00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:30.130\nstanding right beside you like Daniel, and\nhe's also submitting a project too for\n\n189\n00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.550\nthe same pool of funds that we have.\n\n190\n00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:37.910\nAnd if I can't say why my project\nshould exist and Daniel can\n\n191\n00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:42.230\nactually answer that question in his\nproject charter, fairly easy, right?\n\n192\n00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:45.450\nDaniel might actually be able to justify\nand I'd go, well it's just a neat\n\n193\n00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.190\nproject that we should consider and\nDaniel is here actually writing out like,\n\n194\n00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.690\nhere's why we need it,\nhere's why would impact our business.\n\n195\n00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.690\nHere are some of the things we need\nto make sure that we are doing.\n\n196\n00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:58.950\nSo it could be just\nsomething as simple as that.\n\n197\n00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.240\nThe other one,\nlet me see what I can actually type here.\n\n198\n00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.842\nNot as easy to type on\nthis than I think here.\n\n199\n00:11:05.842 --> 00:11:12.603\nWhat problem are we trying to solve?\n\n200\n00:11:16.361 --> 00:11:19.420\nAnd it may be something as simple as that.\n\n201\n00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:22.050\nIs that, what has happened during our\n\n202\n00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:26.190\ntime is that we realize as this project\nhas come on that there is a problem,\n\n203\n00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.620\nit actually addresses\nsomething very specific.\n\n204\n00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.010\nWe want to make sure that we\nname that very specific thing\n\n205\n00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.640\nthat this project is\nsupposed to accomplish.\n\n206\n00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.310\nWhy?\n\n207\n00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:39.180\nBecause even though people deal in\ngeneralities when they're in a group,\n\n208\n00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.320\nright, but when you actually have\na project charter like this and\n\n209\n00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.730\nyou need to get people on your side\nthey wanna know how the impacts them.\n\n210\n00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.320\nWhat are the specifics?\n\n211\n00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:53.225\nAnd if you can find a particular problem\nthat this project ends up solving,\n\n212\n00:11:53.225 --> 00:11:54.685\nthat's a lot more likely and\n\n213\n00:11:54.685 --> 00:11:59.295\nthat's what the project charter can really\nhelp us do if we can actually define that.\n\n214\n00:11:59.295 --> 00:12:02.052\nAnd lastly, of course,\nwhat is our deliverable or\n\n215\n00:12:02.052 --> 00:12:04.949\nwhat are we ultimately trying\nto accomplish from it?\n\n216\n00:12:08.496 --> 00:12:14.800\nAnd what are we trying to\naccomplish from the project itself?\n\n217\n00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.850\nNow the reason why that's\nactually important is because,\n\n218\n00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:22.420\nremember that with everybody competing for\na same amount of resources a lot of times,\n\n219\n00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.600\nespecially in big companies,\nthe very fact is, we may say,\n\n220\n00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.700\nthat sounds like a good idea, it looks\ngood on paper, it does everything,\n\n221\n00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:35.070\nbut what is it that we're\nreally trying to accomplish?\n\n222\n00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.435\nAnd if the only thing that I can actually\nthink about here I'm trying to accomplish\n\n223\n00:12:38.435 --> 00:12:42.350\nor build something or to create something,\nis that I'm just trying to make sure that\n\n224\n00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:46.380\nmy time is filled as a project manager\nwell, that may not actually be something\n\n225\n00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:51.490\nwe want to make sure that\npeople are able to see here.\n\n226\n00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.890\nSo overall though, you want to make\nsure you can answer these questions.\n\n227\n00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:56.190\nIn that project charter,\n\n228\n00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.190\nwe've gotta be able to answer\nsome of these questions here.\n\n229\n00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.590\nWhy in the world do we need the project?\n\n230\n00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:06.860\nWhat is it specifically that we can\nactually do, that it actually helps here?\n\n231\n00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:10.666\nAnd then, what is that ultimate\ngoal of the project itself?\n\n232\n00:13:10.666 --> 00:13:13.350\nSo being able to have those basic,\n\n233\n00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:18.030\nvery high level overview of\nthe elements is where we need to be.\n\n234\n00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:21.280\nMost of the time when you actually do\nstart getting people on your side,\n\n235\n00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.940\nit's because they're\nlooking over these things.\n\n236\n00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:27.255\nThey're trying to examine them, your\nproject sponsor is trying to make sure\n\n237\n00:13:27.255 --> 00:13:32.260\nthat you actually have what you believe\nit actually is gonna help here and\n\n238\n00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.380\nthat they agree with it, as well as your\napproach and they believe in you as well.\n\n239\n00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:40.370\nSo these are things that we really want to\nmake sure that we take into account here.\n\n240\n00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:47.680\nSo by just doing these couple of things,\nit becomes more of a time of,\n\n241\n00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:52.220\nwhy can't I remember what I'm\ntrying to say, brainstorming.\n\n242\n00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:57.545\nA time in which you approach together with\nmeeting, and with trusted advisors and\n\n243\n00:13:57.545 --> 00:14:04.610\ntrusted people, stakeholders,\nexpert in subject matter.\n\n244\n00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.690\nSubject matter expert,\nthat's what I was trying to think of.\n\n245\n00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:10.780\nSo, again my words are getting a little\nbit twisted up, but you come together and\n\n246\n00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:14.500\nyou're trying to make sure is this\nproject is something that can be done?\n\n247\n00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.230\nIs everything that we need right here and\n\n248\n00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:22.330\nso you wanna make sure that that's\nactually very clear at the very beginning.\n\n249\n00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:26.740\nSo, those are two kind of very basic\nelements that we need to think about but\n\n250\n00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.270\nafter that though,\nwe also have to present some facts and\n\n251\n00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:32.260\nsome details as what we also need to do.\n\n252\n00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.640\nSo, that is the third thing that we\nalso want to take a look at as well.\n\n253\n00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.210\nSo, when we start taking a look here,\n\n254\n00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.870\nwe talk about some of the different\nhigh level assumptions.\n\n255\n00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.200\nAgain, I'm gonna be cliche Dan,\n\n256\n00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.500\nyou know we've all heard this,\nwhat happens when we assume things?\n\n257\n00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.840\nWe make a-\n>> We are correct 100% of the time.\n\n258\n00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.310\n>> 100% of the time, that's right.\n\n259\n00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:53.410\nYeah we understand it and\n\n260\n00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:57.610\nwe've heard that cliche all of our lives\nand after you hear it about 50 times or so\n\n261\n00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:01.510\nyou tend to roll your eyes at everything\nbut you understand what's going on here.\n\n262\n00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:06.030\nAnd the very fact is, as much as that's\na cliche, it can really be the truth\n\n263\n00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:10.230\nespecially when you're asking for\npeople to invest their time and effort and\n\n264\n00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.400\nmoney into something that\nyou're gonna be involved in and\n\n265\n00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.480\nyou're actually dragging,\nI shouldn't say drag.\n\n266\n00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.840\nYou're giving them the opportunity\n\n267\n00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.430\nto make an investment into that\nparticular project that you're in.\n\n268\n00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:26.020\nBut what you wanna do at this point\nis actually focus in on what we call\n\n269\n00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:28.860\nassumptions that are actually\nbeing taking place.\n\n270\n00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:34.530\nNow there's absolutely things that\nyou can actually assume on projects.\n\n271\n00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:39.170\nOne, that if the project charter gets\nsigned, that you should have, perhaps,\n\n272\n00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.820\nthe resources that are gonna stand\nbehind you to finish the project.\n\n273\n00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.440\nThat's not a bad assumption.\n\n274\n00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.671\nIf you get the charter approval,\nsomebody signs off on it,\n\n275\n00:15:47.671 --> 00:15:52.130\nwell they're essential authorizing\nthe start, the planning, the execution,\n\n276\n00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:56.025\nthe controlling, the monitoring,\nthe finishing up of that project.\n\n277\n00:15:56.025 --> 00:15:58.265\nThat's a great assumption to have.\n\n278\n00:15:58.265 --> 00:16:03.482\nSo we can start off by just looking at\nthe idea here That the resources that will\n\n279\n00:16:03.482 --> 00:16:09.430\nbe there for us, is what we actually want\nto make sure that we have available to us.\n\n280\n00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.740\nSo those are actually great assumptions\nthat we can take into account.\n\n281\n00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.340\nIt doesn't always happen, but\n\n282\n00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:19.890\na lot of times you can actually assume\nsomething like that will also be there.\n\n283\n00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:22.310\nThe other thing of course is that\nwhen you start off to take and\n\n284\n00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.400\nlook here, it's the funding part too.\n\n285\n00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:30.280\nIf you get it authorized and you actually\ndo have an overall figure in mind,\n\n286\n00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.920\nsomebody signs off on it, you can\nassume you're getting that much for\n\n287\n00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.400\nthe budget of your project, Okay?\n\n288\n00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.355\nNow it doesn't mean you'll get\nevery single penny right away,\n\n289\n00:16:40.355 --> 00:16:43.368\nwe're talking about in\nterms of cost managing.\n\n290\n00:16:43.368 --> 00:16:48.618\nCost management here, where it may be\nthat they go, okay, we're gonna allocate\n\n291\n00:16:48.618 --> 00:16:54.040\n$300,000 to your project, but\nthis is the way it's gonna be distributed.\n\n292\n00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.660\nYou're gonna get $100,000 up front, and\n\n293\n00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:59.620\nthen as you meet the rest of the project,\nhere's where it'll actually dole out into.\n\n294\n00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.180\nBut remember your assumption,\n\n295\n00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.360\ncuz you may be assuming that\nyou're starting off with $300,000.\n\n296\n00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.850\nAnd Daniel goes, I'm gonna buy this\npiece of equipment right away.\n\n297\n00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:08.970\nI'm gonna make sure I get\nthis piece of equipment.\n\n298\n00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:12.050\nAnd now all the sudden it's like, wait\na minute, I can't pay anybody to actually\n\n299\n00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.220\nwork on my project now that\nI've bought all that equipment.\n\n300\n00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.660\nAnd so you have to actually understand\nwhat your assumptions are gonna be\n\n301\n00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.220\nas far as funding as well.\n\n302\n00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:25.130\nNow, another one that may actually\naffect us incredibly here.\n\n303\n00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:28.360\nIs trying to assume something\nbased on the weather.\n\n304\n00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:33.370\nNow Daniel, we live in Florida and\nthat means we are prone to hurricanes.\n\n305\n00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:37.440\nAnd the best laid plans for\noutdoor construction projects\n\n306\n00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.940\nduring hurricane season,\ncan go to pot very quickly.\n\n307\n00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.990\n>> Well it's a roll of\nthe dice every time.\n\n308\n00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.620\nI mean hurricanes we can kind of track and\n\n309\n00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.720\nsee them coming cuz they develop of\nthe coast of Africa normally and\n\n310\n00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.330\nthen work their way here and\nthen we can project a forecast.\n\n311\n00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.870\nActually I worked for a insurance company\nwhere I ran the servers that did those\n\n312\n00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:58.720\nforecasts projections and\nmade sure that they were actually working.\n\n313\n00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.900\nIt was kind of cool I could use it\nas my own little weather station,\n\n314\n00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:06.250\nbut that being said, the weather does\nchange here a lot, I mean, we always make\n\n315\n00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.100\nthe joke if you don't like the weather,\nwait 15 minutes it'll be different.\n\n316\n00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.530\nYou may be like that and he's right.\n\n317\n00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.110\nIt goes into account,\nyou have to lay that account.\n\n318\n00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:17.050\nIf you work in a construction business,\nyou can not say,\n\n319\n00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:19.970\nwe're 100% sure we're\ngonna have sun shiny days.\n\n320\n00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:23.910\nAnd you're gonna have to go off\nthe weatherman's forecast and\n\n321\n00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:25.452\nwe all know how accurate they can be.\n\n322\n00:18:25.452 --> 00:18:26.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [COUGH]\n\n323\n00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.600\n>> So it's a real like he says assumption.\n\n324\n00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.072\nI like to use the word hypothesis.\n\n325\n00:18:30.072 --> 00:18:32.620\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] >> I'm making an educated guess\n\n326\n00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:37.000\nas to what is going to be based\noff of the information that I have\n\n327\n00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.710\ncuz assumption has such\na negative connotation to it.\n\n328\n00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.070\nBut that's probably\nthe terminology they're using.\n\n329\n00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.950\n>> It really is.\n\n330\n00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:46.240\nThe very fact is you just have to realize\nthat there are some things that you'll\n\n331\n00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:46.760\nend up doing.\n\n332\n00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:51.110\nYou'll kind of see that and that's where\na lot of it actually gets controlled.\n\n333\n00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.370\nYou might make an assumption\nhere right that,\n\n334\n00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:57.350\nyes this house can be built in three days,\nbarring the weather, okay?\n\n335\n00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:00.010\nCuz you're just assuming\nyeah look at the forecast.\n\n336\n00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:03.120\nThe next three days are clear,\nor free or whatever it might be.\n\n337\n00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.910\nI should be able to pour the concrete and\ndo everything else, but\n\n338\n00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.500\nwhat if it all of a sudden\nturns into hurricane,\n\n339\n00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:12.410\nwhatever the next hurricane is, and\nnow for the next three days it's raining?\n\n340\n00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.760\nWell people can say well you're still\nsupposed to keep on that project schedule.\n\n341\n00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.530\nAnd you could say well wait a minute here,\naccording to the charter, we said\n\n342\n00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:24.380\nwe could do it but the very fact is, we\nassumed that the weather would be good and\n\n343\n00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.930\nthat we would be able to do\neverything that we need to.\n\n344\n00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.230\nSo, you may actually have to do\nsomething like that, and those are key.\n\n345\n00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:35.170\nI remember seeing on something on\none of the channels out there where\n\n346\n00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.100\nthey talked about a building of\nthis bridge I think in Hong Kong.\n\n347\n00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.190\nAnd they had to wait for the typhoon\nseason to pass before they could actually\n\n348\n00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:46.310\ndo some of the things or even schedule it\nwithin hours that they would have a six\n\n349\n00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:50.240\nhour window to be able to do\nsomething before the winds picked up.\n\n350\n00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.400\nI mean, I couldn't even imagine myself\nmanaging a project of that scope and\n\n351\n00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.720\nsaying, yeah when we start\nit's six hours non-stop and\n\n352\n00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.400\neverybody's got to be right there and\njust pounding away and\n\n353\n00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.860\nget it done in the next six hours or\nit's not gonna get accomplished.\n\n354\n00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:07.950\nSo sometimes you do,\n\n355\n00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:12.420\nyou have to take the fact,\nespecially on outdoor type of projects.\n\n356\n00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:17.008\nWeather may trip you up but you can make\ncertain assumptions based on the weather\n\n357\n00:20:17.008 --> 00:20:20.855\nand what the progress you can do\nthere is also gonna be true as well.\n\n358\n00:20:20.855 --> 00:20:22.758\nThe other thing, of course,\n\n359\n00:20:22.758 --> 00:20:27.868\nis you make assumptions about a chain\nof resources that are available, right?\n\n360\n00:20:27.868 --> 00:20:31.790\nSo all of us believe, especially when\nyou're constructing here in Florida, okay,\n\n361\n00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:35.110\nthat you'll get all the materials\nyou need to barring the hurricane.\n\n362\n00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.090\nThat's just the way it is.\n\n363\n00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:40.020\nThere was several years ago\nwhen a couple of different home\n\n364\n00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:44.189\ndevelopments that happened\ndown in central Florida.\n\n365\n00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.190\nThey were brand spanking new.\n\n366\n00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:49.960\nBut all of the sudden,\nwhen those hurricanes came through,\n\n367\n00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.990\nyou couldn't even tell where\nroads were anymore, right?\n\n368\n00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:55.170\nThey had washed up so\nmuch dirt and sand over the road.\n\n369\n00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.720\nTrucks couldn't actually verify that\nthey were actually going on the road\n\n370\n00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.040\nto the right development.\n\n371\n00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:00.720\nSo what do they do?\n\n372\n00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.770\nThey stopped actually sending materials,\nbecause they're saying,\n\n373\n00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:05.600\nwe're just losing our materials.\n\n374\n00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.250\nWe don't have a clue where they're ending\nup, the guys are parking their trucks and\n\n375\n00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.430\nthen next day what happens,\nwell they get looted.\n\n376\n00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:15.340\nThose trucks are getting looted, that\nthey're just parking them out there so\n\n377\n00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.930\nyou do have to actually worry\nabout some of these things.\n\n378\n00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:22.120\nBut you need to make your general,\noverall high level of assumptions\n\n379\n00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.310\nThat you actually want to do here when\nyou're beginning to create this project,\n\n380\n00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:29.970\nyou want to make sure that you\ncan also contain that there.\n\n381\n00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.040\n>> The chatroom actually\nmakes a good point as well,\n\n382\n00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.690\nas you gotta what about\nthe cost increases?\n\n383\n00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.320\nWhat if gas prices goes up, right?\n\n384\n00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.580\nOr maybe they go down [COUGH] and\nall of a sudden.\n\n385\n00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.760\nWhat you projected, what you assumed\nas far as the maybe the money that\n\n386\n00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.590\nyou're gonna spend is different, right?\n\n387\n00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.840\nSo you have to make leeways.\n\n388\n00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.400\nIt's all the best guess, and\nit is an educated guess.\n\n389\n00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.020\nYou have an idea of what is going on,\nit's not just a well,\n\n390\n00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:56.500\nyou know I think it'll take\n$230,000 to build this project.\n\n391\n00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.010\nAnd that's we're gonna budget for,\nand it really costs 4 million.\n\n392\n00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:04.970\nThat's ridiculous for you to make\nthose kind of just wild guesses.\n\n393\n00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:08.390\nThese are more accurate,\nmore educated type guesses.\n\n394\n00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.260\n>> Yeah, at least that's what\nwe're hoping for, right?\n\n395\n00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:14.610\nIs that there are some things we're gonna\nassume, that we believe that this project\n\n396\n00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:18.730\ncharter has to make an assumption\non before we can even begin.\n\n397\n00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:22.095\nCuz somebody has to be able to authorize\nsome particular amount of money and\n\n398\n00:22:22.095 --> 00:22:24.840\nspending and\nyou do have to worry about that.\n\n399\n00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:29.060\nOne of the big things that you can not\nassume anymore is the idea of things,\n\n400\n00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.820\nlike we talked about, fuel prices.\n\n401\n00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:34.210\nYou know, you think that\nthe load that you actually have\n\n402\n00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:38.420\ncoming in is worth $100,000 what they\ndeliver and all the sudden you realize\n\n403\n00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.890\nthat there's a $15,000 surcharge on it and\nthey're like well why?\n\n404\n00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:48.240\nBecause every gas station from where\nyou are in Florida to the Georgia\n\n405\n00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:53.350\nstate line, all of their gas went\nup to $3.75 per gallon of fuel.\n\n406\n00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.830\nWell now, that company is saying look,\n\n407\n00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.680\nif you want it, you got to be\nwilling to pay that surcharge.\n\n408\n00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.940\nBut overall though, you can at least make\nestimates based on that, and you do.\n\n409\n00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.470\nYou have to include these general\nlevel types of assumptions,\n\n410\n00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:08.910\nvery high level, because if you don't,\nwhat is actually gonna be authorized?\n\n411\n00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:09.760\nMaybe nothing.\n\n412\n00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.825\nSo you have to at least do some of them.\n\n413\n00:23:11.825 --> 00:23:16.115\nNow of course, the other thing we also\nassume is that the project managers and\n\n414\n00:23:16.115 --> 00:23:20.346\nof course the entire project team\nare gonna work on high level constraints.\n\n415\n00:23:20.346 --> 00:23:23.634\nAnd that means from the very\nbeginning of the project,\n\n416\n00:23:23.634 --> 00:23:27.996\nwe take in the consideration,\ntime constraints, cost constraints and\n\n417\n00:23:27.996 --> 00:23:31.943\nof course requirement constraints\nthat we have available to us.\n\n418\n00:23:31.943 --> 00:23:36.221\nAnd so we work within that\nProject Management Triangle and we try and\n\n419\n00:23:36.221 --> 00:23:40.640\nensure that all of those are actually\nin a balance at all times.\n\n420\n00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.080\nAnd so we also make that\nparticular assumption as well.\n\n421\n00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.956\nEvery project that you end up managing,\nneeds to make sure that they keep and\n\n422\n00:23:47.956 --> 00:23:49.722\nclear a goal and with that in mind.\n\n423\n00:23:49.722 --> 00:23:54.217\nWhat if I can make the best house in the\nworld, but it takes me 15 years to do so?\n\n424\n00:23:54.217 --> 00:23:56.717\nWell probably the person that\nwanted to move in that house,\n\n425\n00:23:56.717 --> 00:23:59.517\nprobably moved into two or\nthree during that particular time, and\n\n426\n00:23:59.517 --> 00:24:01.623\ndidn't care whether I\nfinished a project or not.\n\n427\n00:24:01.623 --> 00:24:02.320\nOkay?\n\n428\n00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.977\nWhat if I can actually verify that I\nmade the cheapest house in the world?\n\n429\n00:24:05.977 --> 00:24:09.554\nWell, the person that wants the best house\nin the world probably won't even consider\n\n430\n00:24:09.554 --> 00:24:10.108\nit anymore.\n\n431\n00:24:10.108 --> 00:24:13.221\nSo you always have to be willing\nto understand something in\n\n432\n00:24:13.221 --> 00:24:16.270\nyour project charter that\nalways has to take place within\n\n433\n00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:18.377\nthose high level of constraints here.\n\n434\n00:24:18.377 --> 00:24:21.373\nThat we call the time,\nthe cost, and the quality,\n\n435\n00:24:21.373 --> 00:24:24.100\nor the requirements that we also have.\n\n436\n00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.886\nSo, we have to actually do that too.\n\n437\n00:24:25.886 --> 00:24:30.026\nNow, the last two here we're gonna\ntalk about very briefly here as well\n\n438\n00:24:30.026 --> 00:24:33.752\nbecause we're gonna go much more\nin depth on the idea of risks and\n\n439\n00:24:33.752 --> 00:24:37.081\nof course project objectives\nhere just briefly, okay?\n\n440\n00:24:37.081 --> 00:24:40.959\nBut when we talk about\nthe high level of risks, okay?\n\n441\n00:24:40.959 --> 00:24:43.040\nThis is what Daniel was talking about.\n\n442\n00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:47.120\nWhen things like the weather\naffects us before we realize it,\n\n443\n00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.770\nwe've gotta be able to make some\neducated guesses on whether or\n\n444\n00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:53.980\nnot we really believe it's gonna\nbe impacting us this way or not.\n\n445\n00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.080\nAnd you do,\nyou need to include those in there.\n\n446\n00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.828\nThe person that doesn't assume that\nthere's some type of risk to this project\n\n447\n00:24:59.828 --> 00:25:02.666\nis the person that's really\ngonna get cut down by every risk\n\n448\n00:25:02.666 --> 00:25:06.272\nthat's actually out there because he\ndid not take the time to look at them.\n\n449\n00:25:06.272 --> 00:25:10.448\nWhen you take the time to insert into\nyour project plan that there is a certain\n\n450\n00:25:10.448 --> 00:25:13.661\namount of risk associated\nwith this particular project.\n\n451\n00:25:13.661 --> 00:25:16.457\nIt at least lets the people\ntaking a look at it,\n\n452\n00:25:16.457 --> 00:25:20.260\nthe stakeholders as well as\nthe project sponsor, and saying,\n\n453\n00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:25.020\nsomething Daniel has considered\nthis from different points of view.\n\n454\n00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.370\nHe's taken a look at\nthe overall project and\n\n455\n00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:30.310\nhe says,\nhere is the risks we may have to face.\n\n456\n00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:33.380\nSo, the majority of time what our\npeople like project sponsors and\n\n457\n00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.790\nstakeholders are looking for.\n\n458\n00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:37.730\nWhat they are looking for\nare things like the budget risk.\n\n459\n00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:40.210\nHow likely is it that Daniel\nis gonna go over budget?\n\n460\n00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:42.320\nOkay, when we start taking them on.\n\n461\n00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.650\nSo it may be that a sponsor takes a look,\nor\n\n462\n00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:49.970\na stakeholder goes Daniel's really,\nhis budget really isn't high enough and\n\n463\n00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:54.460\nhe's actually in danger, even from looking\nat that he's gonna go overboard, okay?\n\n464\n00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:58.550\nWell, he needs to know that, so it could\nbe where Daniel actually is told even\n\n465\n00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:01.320\nbefore anything's actually ever\npicked up to start his project.\n\n466\n00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.975\nThat Dan you may need to come\nback with a better budget,\n\n467\n00:26:03.975 --> 00:26:06.680\nthan what we actually start to see here.\n\n468\n00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.455\nThe same thing with scheduling,\nDaniel, I'm gonna pick on Daniel again.\n\n469\n00:26:10.455 --> 00:26:14.473\nLet's say that Daniel a brand new project\nmanager and even though he's seen\n\n470\n00:26:14.473 --> 00:26:18.806\nthe project that an experienced project\nmanagers taken on has taken let's says,\n\n471\n00:26:18.806 --> 00:26:19.714\nsix weeks to do.\n\n472\n00:26:19.714 --> 00:26:25.398\nDaniel automatically says, no,\nmy team we can do it in three [LAUGH].\n\n473\n00:26:25.398 --> 00:26:27.336\nAnd when something like that happens,\n\n474\n00:26:27.336 --> 00:26:30.212\nit becomes a risk to the schedule\nthat he's now proposed,\n\n475\n00:26:30.212 --> 00:26:34.281\nnow in the end of that second week,\nhe's like, look I've gotten 30% done.\n\n476\n00:26:34.281 --> 00:26:37.911\nAnd I'm supposed to be 100% done\nby the end of next week, and\n\n477\n00:26:37.911 --> 00:26:41.210\nthat again is a risk that we\nhave to be willing to take.\n\n478\n00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:45.130\nAnd so, all of that can actually be\ndone through proper planning but\n\n479\n00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:46.970\nit actually takes a little bit of time,\nright?\n\n480\n00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:51.410\nA little bit of research for someone to\nbe able to actually make these types of\n\n481\n00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:54.990\nassumptions or these risk statements\nhere and understand what they are.\n\n482\n00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:59.139\nOf course there's also project management\nrisks that end up happening as well.\n\n483\n00:26:59.139 --> 00:27:02.743\nYou might find out resources get\nmoved off of your project team, why?\n\n484\n00:27:02.743 --> 00:27:05.240\nBecause another project\nteam's endangered of what?\n\n485\n00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.146\nNot finishing, so\n\n486\n00:27:06.146 --> 00:27:10.108\nif you have shared resources in that ,you\ngotta actually realize that that may also\n\n487\n00:27:10.108 --> 00:27:13.804\nhappen if they're actually shared\nbetween multiple project teams as well.\n\n488\n00:27:13.804 --> 00:27:15.966\nAnd then even legal risks,\nthe good thing is,\n\n489\n00:27:15.966 --> 00:27:18.029\nyou're working in a larger organization.\n\n490\n00:27:18.029 --> 00:27:20.755\nA lot of that's minimized because\nyou're gonna have a project management\n\n491\n00:27:20.755 --> 00:27:23.911\noffice that's gonna look and go, this is\nwhere you're gonna run into legal trouble,\n\n492\n00:27:23.911 --> 00:27:24.791\nyou better not do this.\n\n493\n00:27:24.791 --> 00:27:29.250\nOr let's take this one a little\nbit slow and take a look at,\n\n494\n00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:33.355\nmake sure anything that\nlooks like could be illegal.\n\n495\n00:27:33.355 --> 00:27:37.607\nYou run it by experts, you run it by that\nproject management office that goes yeah,\n\n496\n00:27:37.607 --> 00:27:40.219\nRonnie, no,\nyou're not gonna be doing that part.\n\n497\n00:27:40.219 --> 00:27:46.526\nLet's just go and face that cuz that's too\nhigh of a legal risk for us as well, okay?\n\n498\n00:27:46.526 --> 00:27:51.040\nAlso you gotta think about future things\nthat can happen with that project, too.\n\n499\n00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.170\nSo remember, that all possible future\nevents that can affect the outcome of\n\n500\n00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:55.240\nthe project.\n\n501\n00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.520\nNow that's more forecasting\nthan anything else, okay?\n\n502\n00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:04.150\nThat is you taking your best guess of any\nrisks that could happen in the future.\n\n503\n00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:09.393\nSo a very low level risk, I know I'm\ngonna regret this, a very low level risk,\n\n504\n00:28:09.393 --> 00:28:13.616\nan asteroid hitting my project\nthe last week that it finishes.\n\n505\n00:28:13.616 --> 00:28:15.058\n>> Well, Ronnie, we're due, right?\n\n506\n00:28:15.058 --> 00:28:16.369\n>> Yeah, we're due.\n\n507\n00:28:16.369 --> 00:28:17.257\nThe very fact is,\n\n508\n00:28:17.257 --> 00:28:21.116\neven though it never happened on any\nproject that I've ever managed before.\n\n509\n00:28:21.116 --> 00:28:23.417\nBut I could try and say that, that yeah,\n\n510\n00:28:23.417 --> 00:28:26.078\nthere's a chance that in the future,\nright?\n\n511\n00:28:26.078 --> 00:28:30.220\nThat, that's a risk that a project's\ngonna hit during the very last week,\n\n512\n00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.275\nas I finish everything up.\n\n513\n00:28:32.275 --> 00:28:36.540\nWell, again, we could go that extreme but\nthe very fact is,\n\n514\n00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:40.160\nI am probably more likely affected\nby things like the weather.\n\n515\n00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.830\nEspecially here in Florida that\nI'm affected by an asteroid.\n\n516\n00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:47.220\nLike I said, I'm probably, that's gonna\nbe my last [LAUGH] hurrah there and\n\n517\n00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.680\nsomebody's gonna go back to the video and\ngo see, it happened to Ronnie.\n\n518\n00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.650\nBut yes,\n\n519\n00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:55.340\nyou have to actually forecast some of\nthese things that can end up happening.\n\n520\n00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.310\nAnd this means you as a project manager,\n\n521\n00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:59.850\nyou're taking a look at\nthose possibilities.\n\n522\n00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:04.470\nAll this going into the actual\nproject management charter itself,\n\n523\n00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:09.180\nis really key parts of the element, and\nof course, the overall objectives here.\n\n524\n00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.500\nNow, when we talk about these objectives,\nright?\n\n525\n00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.020\nWe wanna make sure that we understand.\n\n526\n00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.600\nLet's go ahead and make sure.\n\n527\n00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.200\nAnd I mentioned this before,\n\n528\n00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.790\nall of these objectives should be\nwhat we call SMART Goals, okay?\n\n529\n00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:22.274\nNow not everybody likes this term.\n\n530\n00:29:22.274 --> 00:29:25.086\nI know everybody has different\nspecial terms that they like but\n\n531\n00:29:25.086 --> 00:29:26.795\nI like it because SMART means, what?\n\n532\n00:29:26.795 --> 00:29:27.760\nSpecific.\n\n533\n00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:35.494\nHere and of course the second one here.\n\n534\n00:29:35.494 --> 00:29:36.387\nI don't know why I can't\nremember what the answer.\n\n535\n00:29:36.387 --> 00:29:36.992\n>> Measurable.\n\n536\n00:29:36.992 --> 00:29:38.360\n>> Measurable, see, you knew it.\n\n537\n00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.410\n>> I'm there for you Ronnie.\n\n538\n00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:40.600\n>> Thank you.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n539\n00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.940\n>> And of course attainable.\n\n540\n00:29:45.148 --> 00:29:47.958\nAttainable, hopefully, I spelled\nthat right, I took my glasses off so\n\n541\n00:29:47.958 --> 00:29:48.902\nI'm not exactly sure.\n\n542\n00:29:48.902 --> 00:29:54.337\n[LAUGH] Oops, I'm gonna go over here.\n\n543\n00:29:54.337 --> 00:29:59.366\nAttainable, R, here is the-\n>> Realistic.\n\n544\n00:29:59.366 --> 00:30:00.169\n>> Realistic.\n\n545\n00:30:03.327 --> 00:30:04.284\nAnd then timely.\n\n546\n00:30:06.537 --> 00:30:10.902\nAll right, so that's actually the key\nhere when we start taking a look.\n\n547\n00:30:10.902 --> 00:30:13.952\nWe're not talking about, hey,\nwhat are overall goals and\n\n548\n00:30:13.952 --> 00:30:16.458\nthinking about like I feel\ngood about this goal.\n\n549\n00:30:16.458 --> 00:30:20.406\nWe wanna make sure, that if we've talk\nabout what the objective's are, right.\n\n550\n00:30:20.406 --> 00:30:23.681\nThat it can be put down onto paper and\npeople can read it,\n\n551\n00:30:23.681 --> 00:30:26.828\nthey know that these goals\nare incredibly specific.\n\n552\n00:30:26.828 --> 00:30:31.436\nThat they are actually able to be measured\nwhether or not we're accomplishing them or\n\n553\n00:30:31.436 --> 00:30:35.790\nnot, they are obtainable, in other words,\nthey're not pie in the sky like me.\n\n554\n00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:38.241\nOkay, I'm not competing\nagainst Richard Branson and\n\n555\n00:30:38.241 --> 00:30:40.260\ntaking something into space, okay?\n\n556\n00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:43.360\nSo I could announce that,\nthat's my future project and\n\n557\n00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.660\nI'm gonna beat Richard Branson.\n\n558\n00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:45.840\nNo, that's not obtainable.\n\n559\n00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.801\nI'm not gonna beat him, he's already $2 or\n$3 billion ahead of me, so\n\n560\n00:30:48.801 --> 00:30:50.390\nI'm not gonna worry about it.\n\n561\n00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:52.350\nBut I'm not gonna do something like that.\n\n562\n00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:54.970\nI need something that's gonna be\nactually obtainable not only by,\n\n563\n00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:59.040\nof course, the company but\neven by that project manager himself.\n\n564\n00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.750\nRealistic, the same thing,\nit shouldn't just be a theorial on there.\n\n565\n00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:05.680\nIt should be something that's\nrealistic and of course, ultimately.\n\n566\n00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.930\nAnd these happen in a time schedule\nthat we said it actually happens in.\n\n567\n00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:11.990\nWe can always be right, and\nI'm gonna cliche down again and\n\n568\n00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:13.720\nhe's just gonna hit me over\nthe head after awhile.\n\n569\n00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.590\nBut remember, even a broken watch is what,\nright twice a day.\n\n570\n00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:18.220\nIt doesn't mean that\nit's right all the time.\n\n571\n00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.360\nBut timely is actually the key here.\n\n572\n00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.320\nI can give you the watch and\nyou can be right twice a day for\n\n573\n00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.180\nthe rest of your life but the very fact\nis when we need the thing completed.\n\n574\n00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:30.240\nWhen we need our objectives there,\nthey need to be timely and\n\n575\n00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.280\nactually appropriate for our project.\n\n576\n00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:38.207\nSo all that I was talking about\nduring that whole time, right?\n\n577\n00:31:38.207 --> 00:31:42.280\nThose are kinda the basic elements\nthat you're gonna see inside of\n\n578\n00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.385\na project chart.\n\n579\n00:31:43.385 --> 00:31:47.335\nNow remember, let me re-emphasize a point\nthat I made at the very beginning here.\n\n580\n00:31:47.335 --> 00:31:50.849\nThe very fact is, in your industry,\nin whatever industry that you're in.\n\n581\n00:31:50.849 --> 00:31:54.219\nYou may go, we didn't cover half of\nthat and I still had a project charter,\n\n582\n00:31:54.219 --> 00:31:54.926\nright, okay?\n\n583\n00:31:54.926 --> 00:31:58.963\nWhen we talked about guidelines,\nthere's no set of rules, but\n\n584\n00:31:58.963 --> 00:32:02.123\nwhen it comes down to\nthe CompTIA Project+ exam.\n\n585\n00:32:02.123 --> 00:32:06.664\nThese are kind of the basic\nareas that should be\n\n586\n00:32:06.664 --> 00:32:10.867\nincluded inside of your project charter.\n\n587\n00:32:10.867 --> 00:32:14.116\nAnd that is actually gonna\nbe a key element for us.\n\n588\n00:32:14.116 --> 00:32:17.603\nNow, knowing that,\nthat's great, but Daniel,\n\n589\n00:32:17.603 --> 00:32:21.263\nit looks like that you've\nlet me talk again too long.\n\n590\n00:32:21.263 --> 00:32:23.911\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, there's more to come.\n\n591\n00:32:23.911 --> 00:32:28.232\n>> Yeah, there's definitely more to come\nnow that we understand what the elements\n\n592\n00:32:28.232 --> 00:32:30.772\nare of a charter,\nwhat we need to think about and\n\n593\n00:32:30.772 --> 00:32:33.333\nget the information gathered up for\na charter.\n\n594\n00:32:33.333 --> 00:32:35.205\nThen we have to actually make the charter,\nright?\n\n595\n00:32:35.205 --> 00:32:38.460\nSo that's probably a good place for\nus to go next, right, Ronnie?\n\n596\n00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.630\n>> It is, the very fact is,\nthat's exactly what we wanna do.\n\n597\n00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:45.400\nIt could be that you now go,\nhey, I know all this but\n\n598\n00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.900\nwhat is it that we have to do to actually\nget that charter together, okay?\n\n599\n00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.040\nTo get it ready for\nsomeone actually signing it,\n\n600\n00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:52.820\nto do everything that we need to.\n\n601\n00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:56.610\nAnd we need to take a look at how\nwe build that project charter and\n\n602\n00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:59.300\nthat's what we'll take a look\nat in another episode here.\n\n603\n00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.620\n>> Yeah, looks like we got a part\ntwo in our future and hopefully,\n\n604\n00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:02.630\nwe'll see you there.\n\n605\n00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:04.220\nRonnie, thanks so much for\njoining us today.\n\n606\n00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.019\nI'll see you in part two, hopefully, we'll\nsee you there again just like I said.\n\n607\n00:33:07.019 --> 00:33:11.016\nAnd as far as this episode goes, we're\ngonna go ahead and sign off for ITProTV.\n\n608\n00:33:11.016 --> 00:33:12.179\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n609\n00:33:12.179 --> 00:33:13.054\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n610\n00:33:13.054 --> 00:33:14.765\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n611\n00:33:14.765 --> 00:33:22.810\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:20.224\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\ntoday's episode, well,\n\n4\n00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:22.933\nwe're continuing on actually\nwith a part two here,\n\n5\n00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.980\nin our Project Plus series\nlearning about charters.\n\n6\n00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.980\nJoining us again today in the studio,\nwell, it's Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.320\nRonnie, welcome back to the show.\n\n8\n00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.685\n>> Well, thank you for having me back as\nwe continue on to take a look at more of\n\n9\n00:00:33.685 --> 00:00:36.812\nCompTIAs Project Plus certification here.\n\n10\n00:00:36.812 --> 00:00:39.510\nWe might making sure of course that we\nactually understand the elements that\n\n11\n00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.900\nare gonna be involved if\nyou're ready to take the exam.\n\n12\n00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.857\nBut also hopefully, I hope even more.\n\n13\n00:00:44.857 --> 00:00:48.542\nIs that this helps you along in\nyour project management skills and\n\n14\n00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:52.227\ndevelopment as you might see more\nprojects down the road for you.\n\n15\n00:00:52.227 --> 00:00:56.559\nNow in a previous episode, we did\ntake a look at different elements or\n\n16\n00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.510\ndifferent components that usually you'll\nfind inside of a project charter.\n\n17\n00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.230\nAnd we emphasize the fact\nthat these are guidelines.\n\n18\n00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.400\nThey don't mean that you have to have\nthem, and it is dependent on your industry\n\n19\n00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.260\nor on your company, whether or not you\ninclude every single element or not.\n\n20\n00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.960\nBut just kinda realize that\na project charter is kind of a key,\n\n21\n00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.730\nand those elements are in there.\n\n22\n00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.306\nAnd the only element I didn't actually\nadd in at the end was of course\n\n23\n00:01:20.306 --> 00:01:23.760\nthe approval signature, but\nwe've talked about that before and\n\n24\n00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.246\nwe'll actually show one here in\nthe end process that we have too.\n\n25\n00:01:27.246 --> 00:01:31.070\nNow, what we wanna do in this episode\nis that, now that you understand what\n\n26\n00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.365\nthe components are that need to\nbe inside that project charter.\n\n27\n00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:39.839\nWe also need to know how in the world we\nbegin to develop a project charter or\n\n28\n00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:44.784\nto go ahead and prepare a project\ncharter is what we are taking a look\n\n29\n00:01:44.784 --> 00:01:49.830\nat in this particular segment\nthat we are actually doing here.\n\n30\n00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.700\nSo, we need to know how we end up\ndeveloping some type of project charter.\n\n31\n00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.290\nAnd in project management, every single\ndevelopment that we go through, okay?\n\n32\n00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.045\nWhether it is at a very\nhigh level overview or\n\n33\n00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:06.248\neven down to the work down and\nbreakdown packages,\n\n34\n00:02:06.248 --> 00:02:11.026\nwe talk about in terms of different\nprocesses that end up happening, okay?\n\n35\n00:02:11.026 --> 00:02:15.219\nSo, there's always gonna be a process and\nthe reason why the process is important is\n\n36\n00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:18.065\nbecause that's what we talk\nabout the different steps.\n\n37\n00:02:18.065 --> 00:02:22.413\nDifferent elements that need to\nbe inside of everything that goes\n\n38\n00:02:22.413 --> 00:02:27.200\non to produce what we expect from\nthat particular process here.\n\n39\n00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.910\nSo the one that we wanna take a look\nat today, like we said, is the idea of\n\n40\n00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.980\npreparing a project charter, and\nspecifically how in the world we do so.\n\n41\n00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.130\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my computer, and\n\n42\n00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.290\nhow I've got this kind\nof broken down here.\n\n43\n00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.190\nAnd I don't think I have anything\nsuper important covered up,\n\n44\n00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.010\njust the element of\nthe kinda big arrows here.\n\n45\n00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.012\nBut everybody can see what we can\nsee here and that's perfectly fine.\n\n46\n00:02:51.012 --> 00:02:56.300\nNow, every process when we start\ntalking about project management, okay?\n\n47\n00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.690\nSo we're not talking about the actual\nthings that have to happen.\n\n48\n00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.530\nWe're talking about a management process\nof everything that we have to do.\n\n49\n00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.330\nWhen we start managing, we need to\ntake a look at it from the overview of\n\n50\n00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.020\nthree separate elements\ninside this process.\n\n51\n00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.745\nAnd going through the entire\nprocess is what we're doing.\n\n52\n00:03:12.745 --> 00:03:17.415\nWe need to know Inputs, in other words\nwhat is it that actually goes into\n\n53\n00:03:17.415 --> 00:03:21.755\nthe elements of creating the overall\nthing that we want to create.\n\n54\n00:03:21.755 --> 00:03:25.495\nSo were actually gonna take a look at\neach of this elements here briefly.\n\n55\n00:03:25.495 --> 00:03:29.155\nWe also want to make sure that\nwe take a look at the Tools and\n\n56\n00:03:29.155 --> 00:03:30.990\nTechniques that were gonna use.\n\n57\n00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.360\nSo taking the Inputs that we have,\nwe run them through Expert Judgement.\n\n58\n00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.220\nWe run them through\nFacilitation Techniques.\n\n59\n00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.510\nWe're gonna talk about\nthat briefly as well.\n\n60\n00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.221\nAnd then, what should output from\nthere is what we talked about,\n\n61\n00:03:43.221 --> 00:03:46.666\nis the different components\ninside of our Project Charter.\n\n62\n00:03:46.666 --> 00:03:49.858\nSo that what we end up with\nis that written document,\n\n63\n00:03:49.858 --> 00:03:53.777\nalong with last element which I\ndid actually exclude there which\n\n64\n00:03:53.777 --> 00:03:56.697\nis actually gonna be\na signing element of that.\n\n65\n00:03:56.697 --> 00:04:00.640\nThat actually says, that everything\nis authorized and ready to go, okay?\n\n66\n00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.980\nSo, that is what we're taking a look\nat here when we start talking about\n\n67\n00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.180\nthat development.\n\n68\n00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.120\nSo a lot of times we think that it's just\noff the hip, what we'll do is we'll just\n\n69\n00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.730\ntake out a piece of paper, and\nwe just start writing elements down.\n\n70\n00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.620\nInside of project management there's\nalways the idea of a process here.\n\n71\n00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.040\nAnd that's what we need to be able to see.\n\n72\n00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.570\nSo we are gonna take us, like we said,\nthrough these different elements and\n\n73\n00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.740\nstart talking about where\nthis stuff really begins.\n\n74\n00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.765\nSo during the project initiation phase,\nright?\n\n75\n00:04:27.765 --> 00:04:31.486\nRight at the very beginning, or\nwhat we call the pre-project set-up.\n\n76\n00:04:31.486 --> 00:04:37.802\nThe ultimate result from that, is what we\nwant, which is our Project Charter, here.\n\n77\n00:04:37.802 --> 00:04:42.255\nAnd that means during that initiation\nphase, the majority of the work is\n\n78\n00:04:42.255 --> 00:04:46.280\nnot done of course to actually\nmake the project move along.\n\n79\n00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.166\nIt's done so that the project can actually\nexist and do what we need to do, okay?\n\n80\n00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:55.953\nBut, what has to also go along with that\nis some process of work that we call\n\n81\n00:04:55.953 --> 00:04:59.120\ninputs, that we need to\nhave in consideration or\n\n82\n00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.847\nthat we need to create at some point here.\n\n83\n00:05:01.847 --> 00:05:05.796\nSo, that's what we're gonna take a look\nat right here at the beginning which\n\n84\n00:05:05.796 --> 00:05:09.650\nare these different inputs over here and\nso let's go ahead and take a look.\n\n85\n00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.220\nNotice that I have five\ndifferent elements here and\n\n86\n00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.220\nI may even have more of them than\nwhat could actually fit here.\n\n87\n00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.850\nBut I wanted to at least\nget these elements in.\n\n88\n00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.080\nWe're gonna talk about\nthe Project Statement of Work.\n\n89\n00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.370\nWe're gonna take a look a Business Case,\nAgreements, Enterprise,\n\n90\n00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.100\nEnvironmental Factors as well as\nOrganizational Process Elements here.\n\n91\n00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.920\nWe wanna sure that we take a look at\neach one of those when we start of.\n\n92\n00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.020\nNow, the biggest one that\nwe have here at least one\n\n93\n00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.430\nthat we may not actually be familiar with,\nright?\n\n94\n00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.636\nThe rest less seems to make sense,\nAgreements makes sense.\n\n95\n00:05:40.636 --> 00:05:44.668\nOrganizational assets, they make sense,\nhow we actually accomplish things inside\n\n96\n00:05:44.668 --> 00:05:47.850\nof our organization,\nwhat structures are already there.\n\n97\n00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.810\nEnvironmental Factors, again,\nwe take that in, but it's this first one.\n\n98\n00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.600\nDaniel, have you heard about\nthis idea of a statement of work\n\n99\n00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.840\nas far as a project goes?\n\n100\n00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.460\n>> Just vaguely, I'm not familiar\nwith it specifically though, Ronnie.\n\n101\n00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.510\nSo I guess, that is a good place for\n\n102\n00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.970\nus to start, because sometimes\nyou'll see things like this.\n\n103\n00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.850\nIt kind of understand each one of\nthe words that are in the statement,\n\n104\n00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.010\nbut its probably got a very focused,\n\n105\n00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.570\npoignant type of idea that you're\nsupposed to get out of that, right?\n\n106\n00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.560\n>> You better believe it.\n\n107\n00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.050\nThat's exactly what goes on.\n\n108\n00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.710\nThe problem with most projects\nat the very beginning is.\n\n109\n00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.910\nThat we know what we want to accomplish,\nbut\n\n110\n00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.490\nwe don't the elements that goes into\nit to, get it accomplished here.\n\n111\n00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.130\nYour statement of work essentially says,\nthat you as a project manager,\n\n112\n00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.340\nwhen you're presenting this inside of\nthe charter, is you're saying what?\n\n113\n00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.450\nThat you know at least a rough outline,\n\n114\n00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:42.920\na high level of overview of what it\ntakes to get that project done, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.260\nMost of us may not.\n\n116\n00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.880\nWhat if this is the first time we've ever\nactually been told, here it is Daniel,\n\n117\n00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.110\nyou're gonna actually go ahead and you're\ngonna be the project manager for this.\n\n118\n00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.290\nAnd so what we need to see from you\nright here is a statement of work.\n\n119\n00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.390\nWell, what they're actually expecting is\nthat you already know what those work\n\n120\n00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.350\nelements are.\n\n121\n00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.550\nWhat is actually involved in getting that\nfrom the very beginning now that I've\n\n122\n00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.190\ntold you you're gonna do it Daniel.\n\n123\n00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.380\nAll the way to the very end and\nwhat I expect you that you produce.\n\n124\n00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.500\nAnd now here it is, we're in beginning\nproject manager, all right, that's cool.\n\n125\n00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.720\nWhat's in a statement of work?\n\n126\n00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.670\nWell, see that's were comes out.\n\n127\n00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.407\nThe question actually comes out.\n\n128\n00:07:18.407 --> 00:07:22.316\nAnd you're saying, do I need to now start\nincluding this is what's gonna happen.\n\n129\n00:07:22.316 --> 00:07:23.968\nRonnie's gonna take a little\ndab of grease and and\n\n130\n00:07:23.968 --> 00:07:26.280\nhe's gonna make sure he puts\nin on the threads of the disk.\n\n131\n00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.830\nHe's gonna screw it in,\nmake sure he torques it down and\n\n132\n00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.180\nthen he'll move on to the next one,\nis that work?\n\n133\n00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:37.090\nThat's work, but is that the overall work\nof the entire project of going on through?\n\n134\n00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.670\nNo, so, that's what we need.\n\n135\n00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.480\nNow, there's two ways that you and\n\n136\n00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.680\nI can actually three ways\nwe can develop this, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.191\nOne, is if we are smart,\nespecially as a beginning project manager,\n\n138\n00:07:48.191 --> 00:07:51.183\nis that we go to someone\nwith more experience.\n\n139\n00:07:51.183 --> 00:07:55.941\nSomeone that's actually developed\na statement of work before on a project\n\n140\n00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:59.876\nthat's similar in size and ask,\ndo you mind if I can see that?\n\n141\n00:07:59.876 --> 00:08:03.537\nNow you may actually, or\nI shouldn't say that,\n\n142\n00:08:03.537 --> 00:08:08.400\nyou may not have to go directly\nto another project manager.\n\n143\n00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.280\nIf you're working in a large\nenough organization in which there\n\n144\n00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.810\nis a project management office,\nyou may actually go and just ask for\n\n145\n00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:20.660\npast projects that are equal of size and\nscope and everything else here.\n\n146\n00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.370\nAnd say, I'd like to take a look\nat the statement of work, or\n\n147\n00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:26.400\neven the entire project management plan.\n\n148\n00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.860\nAnd that way you can actually\ntake a look at that, and\n\n149\n00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.890\nsee what's actually\nincluded in that element.\n\n150\n00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.590\nThat is by far, probably gonna give\nyou the most accurate way that you can\n\n151\n00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:39.130\nactually fulfill what you need\nto inside that project charter.\n\n152\n00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.860\nCuz inside of that project charter,\nsomebody wants to actually build a flip to\n\n153\n00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.970\njust that charter, and\nsay, hey, here it is.\n\n154\n00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.270\nDaniel Lawrie does know what he's doing.\n\n155\n00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.917\nHe presented this as his statement of\nwork, that's what they really wanna see.\n\n156\n00:08:51.917 --> 00:08:54.605\nThat confidence actually\nbegins right here.\n\n157\n00:08:54.605 --> 00:08:58.880\nSo that's one way you can do that,\nis to go off of past experience and\n\n158\n00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.265\nsomething that might be this,\nso you can do that.\n\n159\n00:09:03.265 --> 00:09:07.645\nThe other way is that there are plenty\nof actual elements out there.\n\n160\n00:09:07.645 --> 00:09:11.560\nAnd what I mean by that is you\ncan go online and do a search for\n\n161\n00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.010\nlet's say,\nproject statement of work, template.\n\n162\n00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:19.950\nAnd if you find something like that\nyou can end up using that, and\n\n163\n00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:21.620\nthat will also help guide you as well.\n\n164\n00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.620\nNow remember the statement of work itself\nand what's also included in there is\n\n165\n00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:31.350\nnot gonna be a formalized guideline unless\nit comes directly from your company.\n\n166\n00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.210\nSo there's the third one too.\n\n167\n00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:38.268\nIt's that you may actually have a template\nfrom your company, so you may do that.\n\n168\n00:09:38.268 --> 00:09:39.740\nNow you could try and\nmake it up on your own but\n\n169\n00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.600\nthat's actually gonna\ntake you a lot longer.\n\n170\n00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.260\nSo you either can actually look up\njust a generic statement of work and\n\n171\n00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.350\nuse that as a generic template.\n\n172\n00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.760\nYou might even be able to request\na generic template form from your project\n\n173\n00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.790\nmanagement team or office.\n\n174\n00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:56.150\nOr you may actually get a copy from\nanother project manager that's actually\n\n175\n00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.460\nworked a project fairly similar to yours.\n\n176\n00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:02.830\nSo, let me go ahead and\nshow you one that I've made,\n\n177\n00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:06.770\nas a template more than anything else,\nhere.\n\n178\n00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.750\nSo, I just did this in\nMicrosoft Word as I took a look.\n\n179\n00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.520\nNow everybody's will be\na little bit different.\n\n180\n00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.470\nI kind of did this as\na generic template and\n\n181\n00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.580\nI put each one on a separate sheet of\npaper as far as the elements go, so\n\n182\n00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.220\nthat way we can actually talk\nabout what needs to happen.\n\n183\n00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.050\nSo normally a Statement of Work at the\nvery beginning here includes of course,\n\n184\n00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.930\nthe company that you're working with,\n\n185\n00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.200\nthe formal things that\nneed to actually be here.\n\n186\n00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.670\nAnd if you're following a template,\nyou just fill out this template here.\n\n187\n00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.550\nThe first element that we generally\nhave in that statement of work\n\n188\n00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:41.320\nis what we call the introduction or\nbackground, as well.\n\n189\n00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.050\nAnd I just went ahead and\n\n190\n00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.570\nput in parenthesis what should\nbe here at this bigger point.\n\n191\n00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:49.440\nIt should provide a general description\nof the project as well as highlight\n\n192\n00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.360\nthe project's background and what is\nto be gained by the project itself.\n\n193\n00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.985\nIn other words,\nyou are really introducing this project.\n\n194\n00:10:56.985 --> 00:11:01.700\nYou're giving a nice little summary\nof what this project ends up doing.\n\n195\n00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:06.750\nAnd the reason why you might want to do\nthis is as your project now begins to\n\n196\n00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:12.420\nmove forward, and you require resources\nthat are actually outside of your company,\n\n197\n00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:16.380\nthis is where you actually end up\nrealizing that you need background and\n\n198\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:22.400\nintroduction for bidding vendors,\n\n199\n00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.270\nto make sure that they understand\nwhat this project is about.\n\n200\n00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:31.060\nSo, imagine that you are actually\ntalking to someone at a meet and\n\n201\n00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:35.050\ngreet somewhere and they say hey,\nwhat is your project about?\n\n202\n00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.270\nWell what we would want to do here,\n\n203\n00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:41.560\nis actually have enough knowledge here,\njust as if we were in conversation with\n\n204\n00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.630\nsomebody to be able to tell them\na little bit about the project.\n\n205\n00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:47.960\nYou don't have to go into specifics and\ndetails here, but you may say, well,\n\n206\n00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.600\nthis is what happened inside of our\ncompany, here's the background to it, and\n\n207\n00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.700\nthis is why we're actually\ndoing what we're doing.\n\n208\n00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.820\nAnd yes, I'm the project manager here.\n\n209\n00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.510\nSo that's kinda a formal\nway that we can do that.\n\n210\n00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.840\nNow, does this have to\nbe in a single sentence?\n\n211\n00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.300\nIt can.\n\n212\n00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.190\nCan it be paragraphs or pages?\n\n213\n00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.170\nIt can be if you really wanna\nget that detailed in story.\n\n214\n00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.810\nBut the way that I would look at\nit is this, this is the document\n\n215\n00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:15.570\nthat everybody's gonna flip to first\nto see, how's this project laid out.\n\n216\n00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:16.790\nSo that's where it goes.\n\n217\n00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:20.060\nSo you wanna make sure you do\ninclude enough of that information\n\n218\n00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.160\nin that statement of work.\n\n219\n00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.530\nThe other portion of it, of course,\nis the scope of the work.\n\n220\n00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:31.350\nNow, the scope of the work here is not\nonly what we expect to accomplish,\n\n221\n00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.530\nbut also it gives us the limitations.\n\n222\n00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:36.490\nIn other words, it says what we\nshouldn't be doing at times.\n\n223\n00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.460\nIn other words, we're actually\ntrying to make sure that we define\n\n224\n00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.470\nwhat is the limitations\nof our project here.\n\n225\n00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.920\nAnd that's really key\nbecause of something,\n\n226\n00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.340\nI think it was actually said in\nanother episode in our chat room here.\n\n227\n00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.930\nSomebody talked about\nthe term scope creep.\n\n228\n00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:55.340\nAnd what we're trying to do here, if\nanything at the very beginning before we\n\n229\n00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:59.950\nactually have any money involved, any\nresources moved to where they need to be,\n\n230\n00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.960\nis that we go out and\nwe do a scope of work here.\n\n231\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:08.440\nThat really does set the actual boundaries\nof what our project will do and\n\n232\n00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.090\nessentially, what our project\nis not designed to do.\n\n233\n00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.570\nSo that way we prevent as\nmuch scope creep as possible\n\n234\n00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:19.000\neven before any work\never gets accomplished.\n\n235\n00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.290\nSo that's what we're trying to do\nhere when we take a look at the idea\n\n236\n00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:24.770\nof the scope of the work.\n\n237\n00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:28.440\nSo you normally would add in all\nof those elements down here.\n\n238\n00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.550\nAnd then, on the next page,\n\n239\n00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:35.320\nwe now start talking about the idea\nof performance a little bit more too.\n\n240\n00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.490\nSo this is where we define the time\nperiod of which the project will occur.\n\n241\n00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:42.780\nSo this is where we're actually making\nthat statement at the beginning\n\n242\n00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.420\nall the way to the end of the project.\n\n243\n00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.280\nAnd where we're expecting to perform here,\nis what we're taking a look at.\n\n244\n00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:51.210\nAnd I put the, actually no,\nthat's actually right.\n\n245\n00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:56.610\nI was gonna say,\nI'm missing a parenthesis here at the end.\n\n246\n00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:00.040\nSo, here it is, time frame of the project\ncan be predetermined or based on for\n\n247\n00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.860\na completion date to coincide\nwith some external requirement.\n\n248\n00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.840\nIn other words, what is our deadline,\nwhat is our milestone,\n\n249\n00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.950\nwhatever it might be here, it actually\ntells us when this project should occur.\n\n250\n00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.930\nSo now if you take a look right\nhere in the project charter, and\n\n251\n00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:19.990\nyou say, the end date of this\nproject should be, let's say,\n\n252\n00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:23.280\nJanuary, not January,\nlet's say June 30th, right?\n\n253\n00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.310\nAnd it's now July 17th and\nthe project is still going.\n\n254\n00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.250\nYou kinda know something as far as\nthe period of performance goes,\n\n255\n00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.690\nwe're way out of bound here at this point,\nand why is the project still going,\n\n256\n00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:34.810\nyou'd have to answer that.\n\n257\n00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.760\nNow the other thing I also put\nis this place of performance.\n\n258\n00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.740\nI kept performance essentially\non the same page here.\n\n259\n00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:45.220\nNow remember that not every single charter\nwill have a statement of work this\n\n260\n00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.749\ndetailed, but I wanted to include in all\nthe elements that we wanted to in here.\n\n261\n00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:52.430\nPlace of performance is actually key.\n\n262\n00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:57.040\nWe mention it in a previous episode\nhere that the project could\n\n263\n00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:02.620\nexpand beyond our location where\nwe are right then and there.\n\n264\n00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.840\nWe might find out something that we\ninstead actually turn over a portion\n\n265\n00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.280\nof our project and\n\n266\n00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.330\nthe work in the project over to a team\nthat's actually nowhere in sight.\n\n267\n00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.070\nIn other words,\nthey are remote to our location.\n\n268\n00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:17.065\nWe want to make sure we\ninclude that in as well.\n\n269\n00:15:17.065 --> 00:15:20.730\nThat that's gonna be part of\nthe project charter, is that hey,\n\n270\n00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.980\nhere's where some of the works gonna\noccur, here's where it shouldn't occur.\n\n271\n00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.940\nAnd you may actually do that due\nto the way that your company\n\n272\n00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.280\nis supposed to be able to\nwork in certain areas, and\n\n273\n00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.010\nmay not actually be able to\nwork in other areas as well.\n\n274\n00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:35.790\nSo you make sure you actually include in\nthat idea of that place of performance.\n\n275\n00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.530\nOf course,\ndifferent work requirements as well.\n\n276\n00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:44.475\nNow, notice that when we start\ntalking about work requirements here,\n\n277\n00:15:44.475 --> 00:15:46.654\nthis is gonna be a high level overview.\n\n278\n00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:51.594\nNow some of the tasks that you wanna make\nsure that you accomplish, you go ahead and\n\n279\n00:15:51.594 --> 00:15:55.246\nyou list those, but overall though,\nremember that for us,\n\n280\n00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:59.400\nwhat we're trying to do is outlay\na basic outline of how we believe and\n\n281\n00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.367\nwhat tasks absolutely\nhave to be accomplished.\n\n282\n00:16:02.367 --> 00:16:05.301\nAt these points in time for\nus to be a successful project.\n\n283\n00:16:05.301 --> 00:16:08.580\nAnd this may actually take multiple pages,\nokay?\n\n284\n00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.240\nIt might be something that's\nsimple as a paragraph, but\n\n285\n00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.690\nit may actually take multiple pages if you\nactually do have an incredible outline.\n\n286\n00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:19.130\nOr maybe you're actually using some\ntype of project management tool,\n\n287\n00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.270\nlike Microsoft Project, or Primavera,\n\n288\n00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.750\nor some of the other ones\nthat are actually out there.\n\n289\n00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.910\nYou may do that.\n\n290\n00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:30.040\nAlso, of course, you want a general\nidea of Schedules & Milestones and\n\n291\n00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.560\nwhat we're talking about is\nschedule along with the milestones.\n\n292\n00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.850\nIn other words, how do you know that\nthe project is actually moving forward?\n\n293\n00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:37.810\nHow do you know that\nthe project is progressing?\n\n294\n00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:40.400\nAt what points in time or\nwhat are the elements that\n\n295\n00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.290\nprove that the project can actually\ncontinue to move forward here, all right?\n\n296\n00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:50.110\nAnd we're getting close to the end, and of\ncourse over all acceptance criteria here,\n\n297\n00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.955\nas far as the statement of work goes.\n\n298\n00:16:51.955 --> 00:16:55.201\nIn other words, at the very end,\nwhen we turn this thing over,\n\n299\n00:16:55.201 --> 00:16:59.396\nwhat are actually those smart goals that\nhave to be in place right then and there.\n\n300\n00:16:59.396 --> 00:17:03.241\nAnd finished before everything\nis actually completed and\n\n301\n00:17:03.241 --> 00:17:06.934\nour work over with, and\nthat's really kind of the key.\n\n302\n00:17:06.934 --> 00:17:11.835\nAnd if your particular project has\nspecial requirements that were\n\n303\n00:17:11.835 --> 00:17:15.431\nproduced by either the project sponsor,\nokay?\n\n304\n00:17:15.431 --> 00:17:20.000\nHe wants a particular element in it or\nby some other stakeholder, or\n\n305\n00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.728\nwas actually needed to happen because\nit was a condition of the project\n\n306\n00:17:24.728 --> 00:17:27.080\ngetting off the ground here.\n\n307\n00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.180\nYou may also add that in\nhere as far as special ones.\n\n308\n00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:33.090\nIt may be that you find out\non those remote locations\n\n309\n00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:36.690\nthat you're working the fairly\ndangerous country instead or\n\n310\n00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.630\ndangerous to you, it may not be\ndangerous to everybody else here.\n\n311\n00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.225\nBut you may actually know that\nthere may be a security requirement\n\n312\n00:17:42.225 --> 00:17:43.131\nthat may be involved.\n\n313\n00:17:43.131 --> 00:17:45.527\nOr you may have to get some\ntype of special clearance,\n\n314\n00:17:45.527 --> 00:17:48.518\nare there any restrictions that\nyou have to actually worry about?\n\n315\n00:17:48.518 --> 00:17:51.650\nWhether it's restrictions, or\nwhether it's anything else.\n\n316\n00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.930\nSo, you wanna make sure that\nall of that is listed in there,\n\n317\n00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:57.530\nbecause it shows careful consideration\nthat you've taken the time\n\n318\n00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.860\nto look at the overall\nwork that has to be done.\n\n319\n00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:04.730\nAnd so those are some of the elements\nthat we actually absolutely,\n\n320\n00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.540\nhave to make sure that we understand and\n\n321\n00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:12.020\nthat we begin with as an input to\nour overall project charter, okay.\n\n322\n00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:16.250\nSo, right there in itself,\nthat sounds overwhelming at times, okay.\n\n323\n00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.030\nSo you actually,\n\n324\n00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:22.510\ndo have something like that when you\ndo take a look at the idea here.\n\n325\n00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.160\nThat your statement of work\nhas to be done in that way.\n\n326\n00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.325\n>> Now, well, we got a good question\nfrom our chat room, Ronnie.\n\n327\n00:18:27.325 --> 00:18:30.780\nAnd saying, that your template\nlooks really more geared toward\n\n328\n00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.440\noutsourced type projects.\n\n329\n00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.430\nHow would this look in contrast\nto an internal project?\n\n330\n00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.860\n>> Yeah, when it's internal,\nwhat will end up happening,\n\n331\n00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.160\nis that you will still have to\nfollow kinda the same outline.\n\n332\n00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.920\nBut where you don't have to\nemphasize are those places\n\n333\n00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.490\nwhere they're actually the external parts,\nright?\n\n334\n00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:51.100\nSuch as actually where the remote\nside is and stuff like that.\n\n335\n00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.700\nBut what you have to do is\nyou have to turn around and\n\n336\n00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.700\nactually use departments instead\nof who's gonna be doing what.\n\n337\n00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.500\nSo a lot of that internal work's\nnot gonna be done by you, though.\n\n338\n00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.490\nThe statement of work is actually gonna be\na general outline where you don't actually\n\n339\n00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:03.870\nfill in all that stuff.\n\n340\n00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:07.700\nWhat you're gonna end up doing is,\nyou're gonna say, here's my requirements.\n\n341\n00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:12.364\nThe project management office will end up\ndetermining your statement of work a lot\n\n342\n00:19:12.364 --> 00:19:12.978\nof times.\n\n343\n00:19:12.978 --> 00:19:15.650\nThe only thing you have to\nhave is your project plan,\n\n344\n00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.701\nat least the outline of what you\nwant as far as the schedule.\n\n345\n00:19:18.701 --> 00:19:22.255\nAnd everything else will be determined by\nyou, so a lot of time your statement of\n\n346\n00:19:22.255 --> 00:19:25.550\nwork, you're just filling out\nwhatever forms they give you.\n\n347\n00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.420\n>> So that makes total sense, Ronnie.\n\n348\n00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.100\nNow, chat room's full of\ngreat questions today.\n\n349\n00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.002\nThey got another question that says,\nhow does the SOW for\n\n350\n00:19:34.002 --> 00:19:36.694\na project differ from an SOW for an RFP?\n\n351\n00:19:36.694 --> 00:19:39.724\n>> Yeah, an RFP of course is a request for\na proposal.\n\n352\n00:19:39.724 --> 00:19:42.592\nWhen we start taking away at both of them,\nthere's not really a difference.\n\n353\n00:19:42.592 --> 00:19:45.990\nNormally, what we have Is the stamina\nwork is actually presented for\n\n354\n00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:47.550\nthat request for proposal.\n\n355\n00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:51.310\nThat way, whoever we are actually trying\nto get to bid on our project from\n\n356\n00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:56.090\nthe outside is going to know exactly\nwhat needs to be accomplished.\n\n357\n00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.010\nSo normally, there's not a lot of\ndifferences when we have that,\n\n358\n00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:03.010\nwhether have the stamina work internally\nor even one for outside the building.\n\n359\n00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:04.830\nNormally, the only thing\nthat we do is we go,\n\n360\n00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.270\nlook, we're removing\nthe bidding part here.\n\n361\n00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:10.540\nWe're not trying to get somebody to bid,\nbut we're trying to get the work done.\n\n362\n00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.730\nMost of these people that end up taking\na look at the project charter, right?\n\n363\n00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.870\nThat's gonna get assigned it, they're\nactually just gonna be assigned it.\n\n364\n00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:19.030\nThey actually just need to know\nwhat the work has to be done,\n\n365\n00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.940\nand it's all internal.\n\n366\n00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.170\nBut sometimes even that can become\na bidding process of saying,\n\n367\n00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.660\nlook Dan's department is better\nat doing this than mine.\n\n368\n00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:27.851\nAnd Dan goes, no, I don't think so.\n\n369\n00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:30.324\nI think it should be [LAUGH]\nwe start pushing the work off.\n\n370\n00:20:30.324 --> 00:20:35.011\nBut just kind of realize that there's not\nreally a ton of differences between them.\n\n371\n00:20:35.011 --> 00:20:37.630\nYou may find some elements\nthat may be different.\n\n372\n00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:40.671\nSuch as this is the time\nelement that you're bidding for\n\n373\n00:20:40.671 --> 00:20:43.984\nor you're only bidding for\na certain point in the proposal.\n\n374\n00:20:43.984 --> 00:20:47.487\nSo you may actually do something\nlike that where they're asking for\n\n375\n00:20:47.487 --> 00:20:50.559\ncertain bids on the statement,\njust for one section of that\n\n376\n00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:54.688\nentire statement of work or you're\nactually bidding for the entire contract.\n\n377\n00:20:54.688 --> 00:20:58.736\nEither way, it goes is fine and it's just\ninternal, that's all your doing is you're\n\n378\n00:20:58.736 --> 00:21:01.343\njust removing those references\nto any type of bidding,\n\n379\n00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:03.349\nany type of external influence out there.\n\n380\n00:21:03.349 --> 00:21:05.160\nAnd you're just saying,\nwho's gonna do that?\n\n381\n00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.850\nAnd a great project management office\ninstead though, they may just tell you,\n\n382\n00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:12.815\nhere's what the standard template is, you\nas the project manager, you fill it out,\n\n383\n00:21:12.815 --> 00:21:14.670\nmake sure everything's done.\n\n384\n00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:19.960\nAnd then, we will select who in our\norganization's gonna do everything for\n\n385\n00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.960\nyou without the bidding process,\na lot of the times.\n\n386\n00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.570\n>> Awesome, Ronnie.\n\n387\n00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.050\nI'm sure our chatroom thanks you for\nthat eloquent response.\n\n388\n00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:28.900\nNow what are some of the other\ninputs that you have for us?\n\n389\n00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.320\n>> Well, if we take a look at my slide\nagain, right here on my computer.\n\n390\n00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.050\nThere's a couple elements, one we're\ngonna kind of get to again in the future.\n\n391\n00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:38.858\nBut we really talked about it a little\nbit more in depth in some previous\n\n392\n00:21:38.858 --> 00:21:39.535\nepisodes here.\n\n393\n00:21:39.535 --> 00:21:40.922\nWe'll talk about the business case, right?\n\n394\n00:21:40.922 --> 00:21:44.370\nWe're just justifying,\nwhy the project needs to exist?\n\n395\n00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:48.115\nWe've talked about elements again,\nlike there's a market demand or\n\n396\n00:21:48.115 --> 00:21:49.965\nthere's an internal need for it.\n\n397\n00:21:49.965 --> 00:21:52.990\nAnd so we just need to make sure\nthat that's very clearly stated.\n\n398\n00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:57.414\nBut really, another key here\nare agreements that need to also be in\n\n399\n00:21:57.414 --> 00:21:59.550\nplace for our project charter.\n\n400\n00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:03.354\nNow, when we start mentioning things\nlike agreements, this is where you may\n\n401\n00:22:03.354 --> 00:22:07.466\nhear about some different terms again,\nSLAs are by far the clearest ones, right?\n\n402\n00:22:07.466 --> 00:22:11.030\nEspecially, if we're gonna be working\nwith people working from the outside.\n\n403\n00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:13.370\nWhat is gonna be our\nservice level agreement?\n\n404\n00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:19.440\nOr if we now actually do have where\nsomebody is actually doing the proposal,\n\n405\n00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.780\nwe also along with the statement of\nwork there want to submit things like\n\n406\n00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:26.420\nmemorandums of understanding trying\nto make sure that once we get pass\n\n407\n00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.430\na little bit more of the process that\nthis person's really who we want.\n\n408\n00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:32.580\nWant to make sure that there's\nactually an understanding between us,\n\n409\n00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.380\nthere's also of course letters of intent.\n\n410\n00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:38.745\nIf they're agreed at this point, we just\nwanna make sure we get all that paperwork,\n\n411\n00:22:38.745 --> 00:22:40.231\nall those agreements here.\n\n412\n00:22:40.231 --> 00:22:45.618\nThis includes email, any type of verbal\nagreement, that now has to be documented.\n\n413\n00:22:45.618 --> 00:22:48.674\nWhat we wanna say, is well, hey look,\nhere's who's already committed,\n\n414\n00:22:48.674 --> 00:22:50.160\nis what we're looking for.\n\n415\n00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.008\nHere's the level of commitment that\nwe're expecting from them, and\n\n416\n00:22:53.008 --> 00:22:54.804\nthis is how that's gonna end up happening.\n\n417\n00:22:54.804 --> 00:22:57.543\nSo, all that is also part\nof the project chart.\n\n418\n00:22:57.543 --> 00:23:00.341\nNow, does that mean that you have\nto actually get every single one?\n\n419\n00:23:00.341 --> 00:23:04.895\nWell, hopefully, you can, but\nremember at this point, you may not have\n\n420\n00:23:04.895 --> 00:23:10.080\neverybody ready to go yet because you're\njust at this project charter stage.\n\n421\n00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.740\nBut if you can, you can go ahead and\nstart formalizing that.\n\n422\n00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:15.830\nMake sure you have agreements on hand and\nready to go, okay?\n\n423\n00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.970\nSo, that's kind of a big section, but\noverall though we're not really looking\n\n424\n00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:23.610\nfor something super detailed about\nevery single one of these, but\n\n425\n00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:26.280\nwhat we wanna understand is\nthat this is a major input.\n\n426\n00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.820\nIf we're gonna actually be\ndeveloping a project charter and\n\n427\n00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.010\nsee what agreements we can go ahead and\nactually justify right now.\n\n428\n00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:35.950\n>> Yeah, and another cool input that\nyou have there on your little chart,\n\n429\n00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.830\nis the enterprise environmental factors.\n\n430\n00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:39.660\nExplain that for us.\n\n431\n00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.110\n>> Yeah, when it comes down to\nthe enterprise environmental factors,\n\n432\n00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.690\nthis is where we turn more internal,\n\n433\n00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.280\nin the way that we were talking\nabout inside of the chat room.\n\n434\n00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.864\nNot every organization has every single\nresource that they need on the outside.\n\n435\n00:23:50.864 --> 00:23:52.535\nSo now, when you turn internally,\n\n436\n00:23:52.535 --> 00:23:55.330\nwhich is where most companies\nwill start at the beginning.\n\n437\n00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:59.678\nIs that they have to actually take a look\nat what is already there as far as\n\n438\n00:23:59.678 --> 00:24:01.857\nenvironmental factors that go on.\n\n439\n00:24:01.857 --> 00:24:03.972\nNow could that be things\nlike air conditioning?\n\n440\n00:24:03.972 --> 00:24:07.540\nIt's possible but what we're really\ntalking about is the attitude and\n\n441\n00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:11.680\ncondition that we find within our\norganization for this project, okay.\n\n442\n00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:17.130\nDo we have what is actually set up for\nus to do what we need to?\n\n443\n00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:17.840\nIn other words,\n\n444\n00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.490\nis the company environment saying yes,\nthis is a project we want to take on,\n\n445\n00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:25.520\nor is it kind of hemming and hawing along,\nsaying it doesn't want to do it?\n\n446\n00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.120\nWhat is the organizational culture like,\nand\n\n447\n00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:32.280\nyou may hear this also in terms of\norganizational matrix where you hear about\n\n448\n00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:37.120\na functional type of matrix versus\na mixed or a balanced or a weak matrix.\n\n449\n00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:41.180\nIn other words, is your company set up to\nactually be able to absorb a project and\n\n450\n00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.870\nbe able to produce a project, or\nare you working with essentially part time\n\n451\n00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:48.290\nresources, where somebody actually does\nhave a full time job, but they're just\n\n452\n00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:52.500\nassigned to you to work a couple of\nhours a day to get your project done.\n\n453\n00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.830\nYou gotta take a look at your\norganizational culture and\n\n454\n00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:58.430\nsee if that's ready for\nwhatever work needs to be done.\n\n455\n00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:02.060\nAnd your project charter has to\ntake that into account as well.\n\n456\n00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:06.610\nAnd then of course, what other regulations\ndoes your company have to deal with?\n\n457\n00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:11.174\nIs your organization a highly\nregulated type of organization because\n\n458\n00:25:11.174 --> 00:25:12.651\nof what they produce?\n\n459\n00:25:12.651 --> 00:25:16.569\nWell if you do, remember that also goes\ninto restrictions and limitations that\n\n460\n00:25:16.569 --> 00:25:20.374\nyour organizations gonna do when it\ncomes to accepting some type of project.\n\n461\n00:25:20.374 --> 00:25:24.264\nSo even the project chart has to make\nsure that they state as the beginning,\n\n462\n00:25:24.264 --> 00:25:27.379\nthat they understood what these\ntypes of regulations are.\n\n463\n00:25:27.379 --> 00:25:32.341\nSo the environment has to be ready and\nwilling then for that project to exist, or\n\n464\n00:25:32.341 --> 00:25:35.250\nit can work against you very much so.\n\n465\n00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:38.070\nYou as a project manager though,\nyou need to actually understand that.\n\n466\n00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.940\nSo that's where it takes you doing\na little bit of fact finding time\n\n467\n00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:44.330\nto understand what your organizational\nrequirements are gonna be.\n\n468\n00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:48.200\n>> Now Ronnie, you have the last\nbulleted input that you got for\n\n469\n00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.450\nus there is organizational process assets.\n\n470\n00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:54.290\nAre these things that are internal to us,\n\n471\n00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:57.660\nthe things that we have at our ready\nthat are part of our organization?\n\n472\n00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:58.690\nIs that what you mean by that?\n\n473\n00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.140\n>> That is exactly what we mean.\n\n474\n00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.500\nAre we set up for this?\n\n475\n00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:05.706\nAnd the very fact is, what assets do we\nalready have in place that will allow our\n\n476\n00:26:05.706 --> 00:26:09.440\nproject to come to completion,\nthat will give us what we need.\n\n477\n00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.347\nA lot of times you'll see your\norganization is already following industry\n\n478\n00:26:13.347 --> 00:26:17.377\nstandard guidelines that will help your\nproject actually do everything that\n\n479\n00:26:17.377 --> 00:26:17.885\nwe need.\n\n480\n00:26:17.885 --> 00:26:20.500\nWell, why recreate the wheel again, okay?\n\n481\n00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.711\nUnderstanding that that is an asset for\nwhat we need for our organization,\n\n482\n00:26:23.711 --> 00:26:28.880\nmanage to be a reason why we want to push\nforward in this project a little bit more.\n\n483\n00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.527\nYou may find out, like we said,\n\n484\n00:26:30.527 --> 00:26:34.619\nthat the entire project charter itself\nthat you need to come up with, you don't\n\n485\n00:26:34.619 --> 00:26:38.793\nhave to start from scratch like what we\nshowed you of pull even template outside.\n\n486\n00:26:38.793 --> 00:26:42.144\nBut it may be that your project\nmanagement office says,\n\n487\n00:26:42.144 --> 00:26:45.850\nyes, use this as your project\ncharter as a baseline.\n\n488\n00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:49.980\nAdd in the elements you need, take out\nthe elements you don't want to use and\n\n489\n00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.990\nthen resubmit it once you\nactually get it signed and\n\n490\n00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:53.890\napproved in the way that you want.\n\n491\n00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:56.745\nAnd the other thing of course is,\nwhat we talked about too.\n\n492\n00:26:56.745 --> 00:26:59.832\nIf there are other project\nmanagers working with you, and\n\n493\n00:26:59.832 --> 00:27:03.802\nthey actually have copies of their\nproject or you have a project management\n\n494\n00:27:03.802 --> 00:27:07.709\noffice that has kept a historical record\nof those projects, you can go and\n\n495\n00:27:07.709 --> 00:27:10.252\ncheck those projects out and\nsay, hey, look.\n\n496\n00:27:10.252 --> 00:27:12.709\nI need to take a look at one\nthat's similar to this size and\n\n497\n00:27:12.709 --> 00:27:13.793\nthis type of scope here.\n\n498\n00:27:13.793 --> 00:27:15.380\nCan you tell me which ones?\n\n499\n00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.330\nAnd that project management\noffice should be able to say,\n\n500\n00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:19.930\nhere's the ones that you\nwanna take a look at and\n\n501\n00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:22.490\njust make sure that you're\nactually covering all your bases.\n\n502\n00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:25.440\nSo those are elements that you don't\nhave to go and spend a ton of money.\n\n503\n00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.990\nYou do have to do a little bit of time and\nresearch.\n\n504\n00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:31.990\nBut they're really assets that you have on\nyour side that will help you to complete\n\n505\n00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:35.490\nthe project charter very easily,\nif you'll give it enough time to do so.\n\n506\n00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:40.780\nAnd you'll see that organizational\nprocess assets, as well as the enterprise\n\n507\n00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.700\nenvironmental factors, they will pretty\nmuch appear in every other process that\n\n508\n00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:49.130\nwe'll go through, because that's just a\npart of project management no matter what.\n\n509\n00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:52.130\nThat you have to deal with\nwhatever the actual culture is.\n\n510\n00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:53.410\nYou have to actually say, hey look,\n\n511\n00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:58.040\nI need to take advantage of what I can\nas far as organizational assets go.\n\n512\n00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.930\nSo that's a big part of\nthe process as well.\n\n513\n00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:05.510\nNow, you want to make sure that you do try\nand include every one of these elements.\n\n514\n00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:08.650\nOkay, that actually gives you\nthe most information that you need.\n\n515\n00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:12.700\nThe most comprehensive information\nthat you need to go ahead and\n\n516\n00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.670\nsay that you can do the best and\nyou can make the best\n\n517\n00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:19.860\nof all that information that will\ngo into your project charter.\n\n518\n00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.280\nWhen you start missing\nthe elements because you go,\n\n519\n00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:26.220\nI didn't remember that one, well that\nagain shows a lack of foresight on your\n\n520\n00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:30.450\npart as the project manager,\nnot on anybody else's part, okay?\n\n521\n00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:34.750\nSo this is where the project management\nside of you or your personality comes in.\n\n522\n00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:39.090\nSo now that you have all that information,\nDaniel, well, what do we do with it?\n\n523\n00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:43.314\nAnd that's where we actually have\nto massage and mold, glean, analyze\n\n524\n00:28:43.314 --> 00:28:48.570\nthe information that we have and put it\ninto that document and that form to do so.\n\n525\n00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.850\nSo the good thing is, if you have\na template, that's what you do.\n\n526\n00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:52.380\nYou take all the information.\n\n527\n00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:54.070\nYou put it in that organizational asset.\n\n528\n00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:56.310\nAnd you just fill out the actual forms.\n\n529\n00:28:56.310 --> 00:29:00.010\nResubmit it and you're ready to go after\nyou actually get that approval signature.\n\n530\n00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:01.230\nBut there's other things, too.\n\n531\n00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:03.208\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen again.\n\n532\n00:29:03.208 --> 00:29:05.060\nThe tools and techniques,\n\n533\n00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:09.160\nwe're not gonna spend a lot of time on\nthis cuz this is actually fairly logical.\n\n534\n00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.980\nYou may actually take all that stuff and\n\n535\n00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.870\nyou may actually present it to\na couple of subject matter experts.\n\n536\n00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:16.650\nSomebody that has already worked\non a project of the same size,\n\n537\n00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.320\nsame scope, okay?\n\n538\n00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.170\nGreat resource to rely on, that they\ncan look at this and go, yeah, here's\n\n539\n00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:26.180\nthe elements that you definitely need to\nemphasize, here's what needs to be done.\n\n540\n00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.090\nHere's what you need to eliminate\nfrom this because this is gonna\n\n541\n00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:32.440\nhelp you be able to accomplish what you\nneed, but not all this other stuff.\n\n542\n00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.690\nExpert judgement is one that\nwe definitely need to rely on.\n\n543\n00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.920\nWe use our own brains,\nwe actually go all right,\n\n544\n00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.520\nhere's the elements that will\nhelp us get this done here, and\n\n545\n00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.400\nto get that project charter\nlooking the way it needs to.\n\n546\n00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:48.079\nYou may actually go ahead and have\na meeting between your project sponsor,\n\n547\n00:29:48.079 --> 00:29:51.508\nyourself, and\nactually kinda the key stakeholders.\n\n548\n00:29:51.508 --> 00:29:56.072\nAnd yes, you start bouncing everything off\nhere until that point where you actually\n\n549\n00:29:56.072 --> 00:29:59.992\nget that project charter to the point\nwhere the actual sponsor says yes,\n\n550\n00:29:59.992 --> 00:30:02.325\nthat is something I can approve of, okay?\n\n551\n00:30:02.325 --> 00:30:06.993\nSo, you might actually have\nto facilitate the dialog.\n\n552\n00:30:06.993 --> 00:30:09.315\nYou might have to facilitate\nwhatever it needs to,\n\n553\n00:30:09.315 --> 00:30:12.015\nto bring everybody into\nan agreement in the way that needs.\n\n554\n00:30:12.015 --> 00:30:15.082\nAnd this again depends on\nthis environmental factor,\n\n555\n00:30:15.082 --> 00:30:16.755\ncondition that you face too.\n\n556\n00:30:16.755 --> 00:30:21.093\nAnd might find out that you have to\nget let's say three out of five of\n\n557\n00:30:21.093 --> 00:30:24.893\nyour department heads to agree\nthat this is great, okay,\n\n558\n00:30:24.893 --> 00:30:27.930\nbefore you can even submit that for\napproval.\n\n559\n00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.208\nSo in other words you may actually find\nout that you have to facilitate what it\n\n560\n00:30:32.208 --> 00:30:35.503\ntakes to do so, you may have to go to\nevery single project manager to do so, but\n\n561\n00:30:35.503 --> 00:30:37.628\nyou kind of realize that\nyou'll have to do that.\n\n562\n00:30:37.628 --> 00:30:42.293\nUltimately though okay, what we hope of\ncourse at the end we end up with that\n\n563\n00:30:42.293 --> 00:30:46.680\nproject charter with all those\nelements that we talked about, okay.\n\n564\n00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.380\nIn the very end here as the output notes,\nwhat is the final doc?\n\n565\n00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.914\nWhat is it that we're trying\nto gain from this proposal,\n\n566\n00:30:52.914 --> 00:30:55.850\nwhich is that project charter, okay.\n\n567\n00:30:55.850 --> 00:31:00.730\nOnce we have that project charter, right,\nthat means we now have a formal document\n\n568\n00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.640\nin hand that we can now\npresent to somebody for\n\n569\n00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.260\nsignature, which is a key\nelement of the project charter.\n\n570\n00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:12.290\nAnd then that now begins the process\nof saying that it can be authorized for\n\n571\n00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:16.660\nthe release of funds and resources,\nand for the project to move from\n\n572\n00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:22.520\nthe initiation stage now into the planning\nstage, is what we're hoping for.\n\n573\n00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:26.890\nSo if you actually do need to make\na project charter, usually the way that we\n\n574\n00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:31.220\nbegin is by using these inputs, running\nthrough those tools and techniques, and\n\n575\n00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:34.560\nthen producing the output right there\nof the project charter that we need.\n\n576\n00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.193\n>> Awesome stuff, Ronnie.\n\n577\n00:31:35.193 --> 00:31:38.131\nWell you've done a really good job of,\nsomething's wrong.\n\n578\n00:31:38.131 --> 00:31:39.830\nNo?\n\n579\n00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:41.111\n>> I thought it was locked up,\nbut it wasn't.\n\n580\n00:31:41.111 --> 00:31:42.678\n>> Okay.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n581\n00:31:42.678 --> 00:31:44.445\n>> Cuz I saw her go-\n\n582\n00:31:44.445 --> 00:31:45.389\n>> Well I clicked it and\n\n583\n00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:48.158\nit didn't go and I was like,\ncrap, it must be frozen.\n\n584\n00:31:48.158 --> 00:31:50.712\n>> No.\n>> I don't know what that was.\n\n585\n00:31:50.712 --> 00:31:52.803\nSorry.\n>> That's fine, no problem.\n\n586\n00:31:52.803 --> 00:31:53.836\n>> Start back from you again.\n\n587\n00:31:53.836 --> 00:31:56.960\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n588\n00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.158\n>> We care not about these things.\n\n589\n00:32:03.967 --> 00:32:06.344\nTip of the tongue, teeth, and the lips.\n\n590\n00:32:06.344 --> 00:32:10.312\n[LAUGH] Awesome stuff, Ronnie.\n\n591\n00:32:10.312 --> 00:32:14.750\nObviously you've done a really good job of\ntaking us through the beginning phases.\n\n592\n00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:17.300\nWhat we need, those inputs,\nmoving into tools and\n\n593\n00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:20.600\ntechniques of what we can use to\nstart formulating that charter.\n\n594\n00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:24.980\nAnd then ultimately the end result being\na charter that can be authorized, and\n\n595\n00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:26.450\nthen work can begin.\n\n596\n00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:29.520\nSo thank you so much for\nwalking us through that process.\n\n597\n00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.370\nDid a great job with that.\n\n598\n00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:32.840\nThank you for joining us today,\nand thank you guys out there for\n\n599\n00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.810\njoining us today as well.\n\n600\n00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:35.970\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign of for ITProTV.\n\n601\n00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:37.451\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n602\n00:32:37.451 --> 00:32:38.356\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n603\n00:32:38.356 --> 00:32:39.226\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n604\n00:32:39.226 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.163 --> 00:00:19.424\nI'm you're host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.424 --> 00:00:22.340\nwell, we are continuing on\nwith our Project+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.042\nJoining us again in the studio today\nis none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:27.090\nRonnie, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n7\n00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.660\n>> Well thank you for\n\n8\n00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.570\nhaving me back as we continue on taking\na look at CompTIA's Project+, and\n\n9\n00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.840\nwe are continuing on our series\nhere through the initiation phase.\n\n10\n00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.420\nAnd today is really more of a review\nof that initiation phase, making\n\n11\n00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.390\nsure that we cover all of our bases before\nwe move on into the areas of planning.\n\n12\n00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.300\nWhere really the majority of the work for\n\n13\n00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.540\nproject management really does lie\non the project manager himself.\n\n14\n00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.050\nAnd he has a responsibility\nto get all of that done.\n\n15\n00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.060\nBut what we wanna also\ntake a look at here,\n\n16\n00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.600\nof course, is where it breaks down and\nwhat we actually have to remember.\n\n17\n00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.700\nAnd we're gonna take a look\nat those five process groups\n\n18\n00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.900\nin which every single project ends up\nmoving through and making sure that\n\n19\n00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.480\nwe do understand what goes on in each\nof those process groups as well.\n\n20\n00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.041\nNow before we do that, there's a couple\nof unusual things that are also\n\n21\n00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:19.222\ngoing on at the same time here,\nin which things have been changing\n\n22\n00:01:19.222 --> 00:01:23.347\nduring the time of the existence\nof the CompTIA Project+ exam.\n\n23\n00:01:23.347 --> 00:01:26.720\nAnd so you might see some of\nthese changes as well, okay?\n\n24\n00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.240\nSo let me show you what I'm\ntalking about here, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.720\nSo CompTIA specifically takes a look\nat the idea of project management,\n\n26\n00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.150\nand it says look, we're basing everything\nreally off of what is in the PMBOK.\n\n27\n00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.120\nThe PMBOK is that\nProject Management Book of Knowledge.\n\n28\n00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.210\nAnd at this point as of\nthe filming right now,\n\n29\n00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.330\nthe current edition of it is either\nin the fifth or sixth edition.\n\n30\n00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.988\nNow when the CompTIA Project+ though first\ncame out, it was in an earlier edition.\n\n31\n00:01:54.988 --> 00:01:58.585\nAnd this means that you might\nfind yourself with a mix\n\n32\n00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:02.266\nof different questions which\nwill call out things and\n\n33\n00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:06.080\nwhich aren't gonna be in\nline with the current PMBOK.\n\n34\n00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.478\nSo let me give you an example.\n\n35\n00:02:07.478 --> 00:02:10.200\nWhat we've been going through right now,\nright,\n\n36\n00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.140\nis of course what's actually found inside\nof the PMBOK and the way that they do it.\n\n37\n00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.960\nAnd the process of project management\nbreaks down into five separate processes\n\n38\n00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.880\nhere, right, the initiation phase,\nthe idea of the planning phase,\n\n39\n00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.010\nexecution, monitoring and\ncontrolling, and closing.\n\n40\n00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.218\nAnd that's how you tend to see them in\nsequence inside of the PMBOK in its\n\n41\n00:02:33.218 --> 00:02:34.354\ncurrent edition.\n\n42\n00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:39.406\nNow, that particular process,\nfive different process groups,\n\n43\n00:02:39.406 --> 00:02:44.840\nI should say, break down into\n47 different processes, okay.\n\n44\n00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.960\nSo, that's they way that it currently is\nright now inside of the actual PMBOK, and\n\n45\n00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.640\nthat's how we're actually developing\nthe courses along those lines.\n\n46\n00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.440\nBut, when this particular exam is\nactually also current, is that you\n\n47\n00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.630\nactually end up seeing that an earlier\naddition of the PMBOK, instead of talking\n\n48\n00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.270\nabout five process group, called out\nproject management knowledge areas.\n\n49\n00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.656\nNow, is it the same thing?\n\n50\n00:03:11.656 --> 00:03:16.398\nYes, they just chose to present\nthe material group differently is\n\n51\n00:03:16.398 --> 00:03:17.506\nwhat they did.\n\n52\n00:03:17.506 --> 00:03:22.360\nAnd so, what I want you to actually be\nable to focus in on, for those of you that\n\n53\n00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.217\nare preparing for the exam as a candidate,\nright, is that if you hear the term\n\n54\n00:03:27.217 --> 00:03:32.370\nproject management knowledge area, or\nwhich of the knowledge areas here.\n\n55\n00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.620\nThey are talking about these nine areas,\nis what they're talking about.\n\n56\n00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.390\nNow, they didn't actually add in or\n\n57\n00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.120\ntake away anything when\nthe new edition came out.\n\n58\n00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.760\nThey just regrouped some of this stuff\n\n59\n00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.800\nto actually say where it\nactually went instead.\n\n60\n00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.840\nSo, all the project management\nguys that came in and\n\n61\n00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.890\nthe PMI came together and said look, it's\nnot that the knowledge areas are bad, but\n\n62\n00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.930\nthey really don't focus in on the process.\n\n63\n00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.430\nIn other words, you're talking about\nall the knowledge that you need,\n\n64\n00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.360\nwhich is great.\n\n65\n00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.010\nThese are areas in which project\nmanagers should be familiar with.\n\n66\n00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.600\nBut really project management is not\n\n67\n00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.110\nreally about the idea of being\nthe most knowledgeable person,\n\n68\n00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.690\nit's about the person that can actually\nmanage what all of this stuff.\n\n69\n00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.360\nSo that's why, instead,\nthat they chose to break it down into\n\n70\n00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.263\ndifferent five process groups that\nhelp you to manage your project,\n\n71\n00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:27.860\nokay, along these particular steps\nbecause that's what they went through.\n\n72\n00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.860\nSo, I did wanna make sure that\nwe pointed these things out,\n\n73\n00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.920\nokay, in that project\nmanagement knowledge area\n\n74\n00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.920\nas well as the progress groups cuz\nthat's gonna be very important.\n\n75\n00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.181\nAnd if those of you also are perhaps\ntaking a look at maybe additional\n\n76\n00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:45.171\nstudy guides and\nstudy aids that are out there,\n\n77\n00:04:45.171 --> 00:04:49.530\nthe actual official Sybex book calls\nout this one right here, okay?\n\n78\n00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.330\nAnd they're saying that this is\nwhat the PMBOK is broken up into.\n\n79\n00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.700\nSo you may actually see\nthem referring to that.\n\n80\n00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.780\nNow I can't tell you on the exam whether\nthey're actually just gonna call out\n\n81\n00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.990\nthe second one or\nwhether they're just gonna call out these.\n\n82\n00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.620\nI can't tell you that, okay?\n\n83\n00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.670\nBut the very notion is,\nif you hear the term knowledge area,\n\n84\n00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.050\nmake sure you're familiar\nwith this terminology here.\n\n85\n00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.440\nAnd if you actually see where they\nmentioned five process groups,\n\n86\n00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.540\nmake sure you know this terminology.\n\n87\n00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.150\nA lot of times,\n\n88\n00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.600\nespecially on CompTIA exams, knowing the\nterminology is actually kinda the bigger\n\n89\n00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.700\npart of a lot of things that you have\nto deal with so get used to both.\n\n90\n00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.840\nBe prepared for both.\n\n91\n00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.785\nIt's not gonna actually trip you up that\nmuch, but if you hear the term knowledge\n\n92\n00:05:30.785 --> 00:05:33.798\nareas, remember that they're actually\nprobably referring to an earlier part.\n\n93\n00:05:33.798 --> 00:05:37.469\nAnd if you hear the term progress group,\nI'm not gonna be able to say that,\n\n94\n00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:41.730\nprogress group, they're probably\nreferring to the current edition as well.\n\n95\n00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.202\nAnd this happens when you end up getting\na large pool of the exam questions where\n\n96\n00:05:46.202 --> 00:05:49.047\nsome of the exam questions\nare a little bit dated,\n\n97\n00:05:49.047 --> 00:05:51.510\nand they may refer to the knowledge areas.\n\n98\n00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.390\nBut then when they start\nadding in new questions,\n\n99\n00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.985\nthey'll probably actually base it\non the newer updated material.\n\n100\n00:05:55.985 --> 00:06:00.440\nSo I think that's a great point for\nus to make sure we emphasize, Daniel,\n\n101\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.010\nis that you may see both.\n\n102\n00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.580\n>> Awesome.\n\n103\n00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.880\nNow Ronnie, is there some\ncommon elements that we would\n\n104\n00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.540\ntypically find in each one\nof these process groups?\n\n105\n00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.150\n>> There definitely is going to be that.\n\n106\n00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.350\nAnd that's what the PMBOK\nreally wanted to focus in on.\n\n107\n00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.601\nThose nine areas that we talked about\nin the earlier way that the PMBOK was\n\n108\n00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:20.860\npresented made it kind of\na little bit difficult for\n\n109\n00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.810\nmost project managers, right.\n\n110\n00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.470\nYou might've been good in finance.\n\n111\n00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.300\nNow Daniel,\nI don't know if you are or not.\n\n112\n00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.741\nBut I'm not.\nI'm not good in math.\n\n113\n00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:28.287\n>> Horrible in math.\n\n114\n00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:31.895\n>> If we go into financial formulas and\nstuff like that,\n\n115\n00:06:31.895 --> 00:06:34.150\nI don't know anything about it.\n\n116\n00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.420\nSo much that my wife just says Ronnie,\nhere's ten bucks, make it stretch a week.\n\n117\n00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.820\nAnd I can do something like that.\n\n118\n00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.000\nBut, overall though, I might not be\nthe best financial wizard at doing that.\n\n119\n00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.260\nBut when you take a look at those nine\nareas, though, it seems like that\n\n120\n00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.610\nthe project manager should what,\nbe an expert at all nine areas, okay.\n\n121\n00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.362\nThe very realistic fact is,\n\n122\n00:06:54.362 --> 00:06:57.430\nyou're probably not gonna be\nan expert in all those nine areas.\n\n123\n00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.011\nSo instead that's when\nthe PMBOK said look,\n\n124\n00:06:59.011 --> 00:07:00.686\nyou don't have to be\nan expert in all the areas.\n\n125\n00:07:00.686 --> 00:07:05.328\nBut as far as the processes go, though,\nand then understanding what falls in that\n\n126\n00:07:05.328 --> 00:07:09.701\nprogress group, that's what you actually\nhave to be able to understand or,\n\n127\n00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:12.618\nprocess group, I said progress,\nprocess group.\n\n128\n00:07:12.618 --> 00:07:14.825\nAnd that's what we want\nto understand instead.\n\n129\n00:07:14.825 --> 00:07:16.248\nSo that's what we're gonna focus in on.\n\n130\n00:07:16.248 --> 00:07:21.107\nAnd what we'll actually find out, Daniel,\nis between all of these different\n\n131\n00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:25.376\nprocess groups here, is that we end\nup developing them in the same way\n\n132\n00:07:25.376 --> 00:07:30.180\nthat we actually in every single one,\nwe develop them in the same way.\n\n133\n00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.860\nWe have what we call inputs\nto each process group.\n\n134\n00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.410\nWe have a set of tools and\ntechniques that we'll use, and\n\n135\n00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:42.000\nevery progress group is expected\nto produce some type of output.\n\n136\n00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.612\nThe output, of course, is the deliverable\nfrom that particular progress group.\n\n137\n00:07:45.612 --> 00:07:50.415\nThe inputs, of course, is what actually\ninfluences and what information that we\n\n138\n00:07:50.415 --> 00:07:54.256\nneed to make sure everything in\nthat process group continues on.\n\n139\n00:07:54.256 --> 00:07:58.303\nAnd then the tools and techniques is how\nwe massage Based on the information to\n\n140\n00:07:58.303 --> 00:08:00.246\nactually our project deliverable.\n\n141\n00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:03.647\nSo, let me show you an example\nof what I'm talking about here,\n\n142\n00:08:03.647 --> 00:08:05.780\nbased on the initiation phase.\n\n143\n00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.530\nSo, let me go scroll over here.\n\n144\n00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.670\nNow, we're gonna be using pretty much an\noutline like this throughout the remainder\n\n145\n00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.080\nof our course.\n\n146\n00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.950\nSo that we can clearly keep\nthis particular idea in mind\n\n147\n00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.180\nof what is common between\nall those process groups.\n\n148\n00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.683\nSo now think about it,\n\n149\n00:08:22.683 --> 00:08:28.630\nif you now have a junior project manager\nthat you are now mentoring up, you know?\n\n150\n00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:32.319\nAnd somebody's saying, well what about\nthese nine areas and they're looking,\n\n151\n00:08:32.319 --> 00:08:36.117\nthey're like, you have to become an expert\nin time management, cost management,\n\n152\n00:08:36.117 --> 00:08:38.270\nresource management, schedule management.\n\n153\n00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.360\nI have to become an expert\nin all that stuff?\n\n154\n00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.100\nWell, you can really trip out and\ngo, absolutely.\n\n155\n00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.250\nBetter believe it.\n\n156\n00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.930\nBut what if you tell them, hey,\nhere are the five process groups, and\n\n157\n00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.220\nthey pretty much fall in the same line.\n\n158\n00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.580\nYou need to find out what is it that\nwe actually need to begin with.\n\n159\n00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.750\nWhere is your base knowledge coming from.\n\n160\n00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:01.590\nThose are the inputs, what goes into\nthe making up of that initiation stage.\n\n161\n00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.560\nYou find all of those elements out and\nyou glean the information from them.\n\n162\n00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:10.160\nAnd then you use tools and techniques\nthat we know that have been tried and\n\n163\n00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:15.010\ntrue, that help us to produce the overall\noutput or element that we have.\n\n164\n00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:19.640\nSo we can take not only in this project\ninitiation, trying to get rid of that,\n\n165\n00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.050\nget that off the board.\n\n166\n00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:25.560\nNow, not only can we take this then and\napply it just to the project initiation or\n\n167\n00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.220\nto the pre project setup, but\nI can now move into the planning and\n\n168\n00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.470\ndo the same thing.\n\n169\n00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.650\nEntirety of planning it,\nthere's gonna be a lot more inputs because\n\n170\n00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.130\nI'm actually now planning\nthe entire project.\n\n171\n00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:40.340\nBut then, I'm gonna have a lot more\ntools available to me as well.\n\n172\n00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:44.030\nAnd ultimately, it's gonna end\nup with my actual project plan\n\n173\n00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.800\nthat I'm gonna use to manage\nthat overall project plan with.\n\n174\n00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.830\nSo, that's what we actually\nend up seeing here,\n\n175\n00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:55.100\nis that in every process you move yourself\nalong through that, where you know what\n\n176\n00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:00.040\nyour inputs are based on those tools and\ntechniques, and also what the outputs are.\n\n177\n00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:05.190\nAnd you do that for each stage in\nthe initiation inside of your planning.\n\n178\n00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.580\nWhen we go into the execution phase,\nwe'll do the same thing.\n\n179\n00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.180\nWe'll go now that we've\nactually got what we have,\n\n180\n00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.320\nwe actually take our\nproject plan as an input.\n\n181\n00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.520\nAnd then this is where we begin managing\npeople, where we begin managing resources,\n\n182\n00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.320\nwhere we begin to take all\nthat into play here and\n\n183\n00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.250\nactually make some type of product\nout of it at the output as well.\n\n184\n00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.300\nAnd then go on through the monitoring and\ncontrolling and\n\n185\n00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.620\nyou're doing the same thing.\n\n186\n00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.982\nAnd also, of course,\nthe close out, as well.\n\n187\n00:10:30.982 --> 00:10:34.650\nClose out will actually happen\nrelatively fast after that point.\n\n188\n00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:38.030\nBut overall though, that's what you're\nactually doing is you're breaking it down.\n\n189\n00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:42.380\nNow I wanted to emphasize this because\nthe strange thing about project management\n\n190\n00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.830\nis that you don't tend to change.\n\n191\n00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:44.940\nIn other words,\n\n192\n00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:50.230\nthey don't actually switch like\na horse into a zebra in the processes.\n\n193\n00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:53.870\nWe know that we actually recognize\nthe initiation, and the planning,\n\n194\n00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:55.560\nand everything else that we talked about,\n\n195\n00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.930\nthose five process groups\nas being what they are.\n\n196\n00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.510\nWe have inputs, tools,\ntechniques, and outputs, but\n\n197\n00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.960\nwhat about the steps below those?\n\n198\n00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.200\nWhat about inside of the execution group,\nand\n\n199\n00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.890\nyou start actually working on work\npackages and stuff like that?\n\n200\n00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.670\nHow do you actually do that?\n\n201\n00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.330\nWell, you do it the same way.\n\n202\n00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:18.860\nYou now take what those elements\ninside of each particular group, and\n\n203\n00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.240\nthen you actually do it a little bit more.\n\n204\n00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.520\nSo let's take, for an example,\nhere is let's say an example of a process,\n\n205\n00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.030\nthat's within a process group.\n\n206\n00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:30.710\nSo when we talk about\nidentifying a stakeholder,\n\n207\n00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.755\nwell that does happen in the initiation,\nbut now take a look here.\n\n208\n00:11:34.755 --> 00:11:38.600\nIs that when we talk about identifying\nstakeholders at this point,\n\n209\n00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.690\nwe're actually doing a subset\nof that initiation group, and\n\n210\n00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.250\nlook, we're doing it the exact same way.\n\n211\n00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.340\nWe're saying that hey,\nnot only is the overall general movement\n\n212\n00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.860\nof us throughout the entire project going\nthrough inputs, tools, and techniques, and\n\n213\n00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:56.270\noutputs, but\nthen as you go down inside of each group,\n\n214\n00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.840\nevery element in that\ngroup does the same thing.\n\n215\n00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.380\nYou have inputs for\nidentifying this, the stakeholders.\n\n216\n00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.630\nUse tools and techniques here again, and\nthen you have different outputs as well.\n\n217\n00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.650\nSo you'll see that every level\nthat you back break down to,\n\n218\n00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.770\nyou're actually gonna\nfollow the same thing.\n\n219\n00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.230\nAnd this is what makes project management\n\n220\n00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.960\nsomething that we can\nteach on a global scale.\n\n221\n00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.350\nNow, that doesn't necessarily mean that\nit's universally accepted this way.\n\n222\n00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.570\nBut what I'm saying is that the skills\nthat we're talking about here\n\n223\n00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.730\ncan be applied across any organization.\n\n224\n00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.650\nAny particular technology\nbase that you're talking.\n\n225\n00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:35.750\nYou have to modify things, but\noverall though, it's the same thing.\n\n226\n00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.890\nYou take your inputs,\nyour tools and techniques, and\n\n227\n00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.420\nthen get an output from them.\n\n228\n00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.510\nAnd you continue to do that regardless\nof where you are in the process.\n\n229\n00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:47.140\nSo, at the grand overall scheme of things,\nas far as the big picture goes,\n\n230\n00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.160\nsame thing.\n\n231\n00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.680\nYou start breaking it down into different\nlevels here, you do the same thing,\n\n232\n00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:57.020\neven down to the most minute process\nwhere you're making the actual element.\n\n233\n00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.540\nYou still have to know what\nyou have to start off with.\n\n234\n00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:00.920\nYou still need to know those tools and\n\n235\n00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:05.590\ntechniques that really do turn exactly\nthe thing that, you know, the cogs and\n\n236\n00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.030\neverything that you need\nto to make that element.\n\n237\n00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:12.740\nAnd in the end, yes, you have whatever\nwidget is the common cool term,\n\n238\n00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.810\nwhatever widget you want to output.\n\n239\n00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.520\nSo that's why a project manager\ndoesn't have to know and\n\n240\n00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.430\nbe an expert in what,\nevery single knowledge area.\n\n241\n00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:25.010\nHe needs to know how to manage\nthe process, and what's the basic process?\n\n242\n00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.680\nInputs, tools and techniques, and\n\n243\n00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.820\nyou know that there's supposed\nto be an output to it.\n\n244\n00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:37.390\nSo in that sense, a project manager is\ngonna actually learn from his experience,\n\n245\n00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.340\nis gonna be able to take\nthese basic things right here\n\n246\n00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:45.560\nin the way that are set up, be able to\nlook at any particular part of a project.\n\n247\n00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.333\nAnd this even comes down to\nthings like cost planning,\n\n248\n00:13:48.333 --> 00:13:51.050\nI was trying to think of what\nI was trying to say here.\n\n249\n00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:56.164\nEven though he might not be great at\nactually managing the money himself,\n\n250\n00:13:56.164 --> 00:13:58.500\nhe needs to know what the inputs are.\n\n251\n00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.480\nWhat is it that we need\nto do to plan this out?\n\n252\n00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.830\nHow do I actually have that?\n\n253\n00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.840\nAnd what techniques and tools do I need?\n\n254\n00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.910\nAnd then what am I\nsupposed to end up with?\n\n255\n00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.340\nAnd that's where that\nPMBOK really is a help.\n\n256\n00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.050\nIt kind of tells you hey,\nhere's what you're supposed to out put.\n\n257\n00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.930\nAnd here are the basic tools and\ntechniques, and\n\n258\n00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:15.930\nyou can actually find\nthat inside of the PMBOK.\n\n259\n00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:20.080\nAnd here's kind of the basic guidelines\non what needs to go into this process.\n\n260\n00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.750\nSo at that point, Daniel, if you were\nto actually take a look at somebody\n\n261\n00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.820\nthat you go, is trying to think whether or\n\n262\n00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:30.340\nnot they can do project management, would\nyou say that that's actually fairly easier\n\n263\n00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.310\nthan telling them to memorize nine\ndifferent areas and master it?\n\n264\n00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:39.440\n>> By far this is definitely the easier\nway in which you could go about\n\n265\n00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.790\ndoing project management because basically\nwhat it does is it creates a template,\n\n266\n00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:46.890\na skeleton for you to structure every\nphase that you need to go through.\n\n267\n00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:49.406\nRyan's got up here identify a stakeholder,\nokay,\n\n268\n00:14:49.406 --> 00:14:51.730\nthat's a process I need to go through.\n\n269\n00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:55.480\nLet me just start using these different\nmethodologies to go through that and\n\n270\n00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.080\nmake that happen.\n\n271\n00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.580\nNow I can follow the same plan over and\nover again.\n\n272\n00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.580\nIt's repeatable, and it's easy to do.\n\n273\n00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.320\nI don't have to, we've said it before,\nwe don't have to reinvent the wheel.\n\n274\n00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.890\nI don't have to go, okay,\nI'm starting from scratch.\n\n275\n00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:09.240\nHow am I going to ever identify\nall of these stakeholders?\n\n276\n00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.960\nI've got a nice little outline to follow.\n\n277\n00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.020\nI know what my inputs are.\n\n278\n00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.040\nI can go through that list, get that done.\n\n279\n00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.980\nI can go through my tools and techniques,\nuse those as a reference, and\n\n280\n00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.900\nthen I have my output.\n\n281\n00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:19.470\nThere it is.\n\n282\n00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:23.160\nI've identified my stakeholders,\nand I've documented what that is.\n\n283\n00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.730\nSo it makes it a whole lot easier.\n\n284\n00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.003\nI kind of think of it as,\nI remember the FBI or whatever,\n\n285\n00:15:28.003 --> 00:15:32.710\nthey used to use to create an artist's\nrendition, they would have overlays.\n\n286\n00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.210\nIt would say is it a man or is it a woman?\n\n287\n00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:34.990\nIt's a woman.\n\n288\n00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:35.790\nThey use a woman's head.\n\n289\n00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.280\nIs it more round, less round?\n\n290\n00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.880\nThey find a transition that does that.\n\n291\n00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.990\nDoes she have blond hair?\n\n292\n00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.560\nBlack hair?\n\n293\n00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.190\nShe has black hair,\nyou put black hair on it.\n\n294\n00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:46.549\nAnd as you build up through it, you're\nusing the exact same technique, but they\n\n295\n00:15:46.549 --> 00:15:51.056\ncome out with a different result based on\nthe specifics that the person gives them.\n\n296\n00:15:51.056 --> 00:15:52.158\nSame kind of idea here.\n\n297\n00:15:52.158 --> 00:15:56.537\nYou're overlaying These techniques over\nwhatever process that you're in at that\n\n298\n00:15:56.537 --> 00:15:57.418\npoint and time.\n\n299\n00:15:57.418 --> 00:16:00.320\n>> And this is why it does make it easier,\nright?\n\n300\n00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.250\nTo be able to teach things\nlike project management.\n\n301\n00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.260\nNow don't get me wrong, some of you\nhave incredible experience goes,\n\n302\n00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.590\nwell that's just an oversimplification.\n\n303\n00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:09.134\nDon't get me wrong, it is.\n\n304\n00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:12.992\nBut it's a great guideline if you're\nhaving to actually guide somebody\n\n305\n00:16:12.992 --> 00:16:17.608\nthrough the process, especially if they've\nnever taken a look at the idea of actually\n\n306\n00:16:17.608 --> 00:16:19.588\nmanaging their own project before.\n\n307\n00:16:19.588 --> 00:16:23.956\nThat if you tell them, just make sure\nyou have your inputs in place, so\n\n308\n00:16:23.956 --> 00:16:29.014\nthat you can actually get a good accurate\noutput that actually comes out of that.\n\n309\n00:16:29.014 --> 00:16:32.585\nThen you actually understand the idea\nof process and process groups and\n\n310\n00:16:32.585 --> 00:16:35.265\nyou start realizing that\nproject management is about\n\n311\n00:16:35.265 --> 00:16:38.257\nmanaging the entire process all\nthe way through to the end.\n\n312\n00:16:38.257 --> 00:16:42.493\nAnd the overall management for the project\nmanager is making sure that they get\n\n313\n00:16:42.493 --> 00:16:47.114\nthrough the initiation, planning,\nexecution, monitoring and controlling, and\n\n314\n00:16:47.114 --> 00:16:50.795\nof course the actual finishing or\nclosing stage is what we wanna do.\n\n315\n00:16:50.795 --> 00:16:53.177\nNow, does that mean that there's\nall that we have to learn?\n\n316\n00:16:53.177 --> 00:16:54.797\nNo, of course not, okay?\n\n317\n00:16:54.797 --> 00:16:57.968\nSo, I would love to say, yep,\nwe're done, and we're ready to do that.\n\n318\n00:16:57.968 --> 00:16:59.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But we're not, okay?\n\n319\n00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.100\nEvery stage,\nof course has different elements in it.\n\n320\n00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.448\nAnd if you are preparing\nas a candidate then for,\n\n321\n00:17:05.448 --> 00:17:09.513\nof course the CompTIA Project Plus exam,\nwe need to associate certain elements with\n\n322\n00:17:09.513 --> 00:17:13.592\nthose different stages, and that's what\nwe're gonna take a look at and do, okay?\n\n323\n00:17:13.592 --> 00:17:18.133\nSo let's go back to my computer again and\nwe'll start here at the very beginning.\n\n324\n00:17:18.133 --> 00:17:22.270\nNow I usually make a good point at\nemphasizing these elements as we're\n\n325\n00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.087\nactually going through\neach of our shows here.\n\n326\n00:17:25.087 --> 00:17:28.973\nBut we're taking a look at the overall\nprocess here and emphasizing what happens\n\n327\n00:17:28.973 --> 00:17:32.302\nin each stage and what we need to\nmake sure that we take care of, okay?\n\n328\n00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:34.228\nSo we're gonna start off\nhere at Initiation and\n\n329\n00:17:34.228 --> 00:17:35.682\nthen we'll go to Planning, okay?\n\n330\n00:17:35.682 --> 00:17:39.204\nSo, when we talk about what\nactually is happening then, and\n\n331\n00:17:39.204 --> 00:17:43.627\nwhat is associated inside of the\ninitiation phase, remember that for us all\n\n332\n00:17:43.627 --> 00:17:48.347\nactivities that lead to the authorization\nof the project's beginning, okay?\n\n333\n00:17:48.347 --> 00:17:51.950\nThat's what we need to understand\nthat has to go on, okay?\n\n334\n00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:55.340\nWe're not talking about any actions\nthat actually are happening\n\n335\n00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:59.270\nin the project itself, but we're saying\nthat any activity that goes into making\n\n336\n00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:03.840\nsure that the project's authorization\ncan begin, that's what we're looking at.\n\n337\n00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.880\nAnd this is where we get\ninto pre-project setup.\n\n338\n00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.220\nWhere we start taking\na look at identifying,\n\n339\n00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:11.670\nin other words being able to know that\nit is a project versus on-going work.\n\n340\n00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.490\nWe talked about validating,\nproject selection, and\n\n341\n00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.190\nstake holder identification.\n\n342\n00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:19.790\nIf these terms are actually unfamiliar\nwith you, make sure you go back and\n\n343\n00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.020\nlook at those previous episodes\nthat we've done up to this point,\n\n344\n00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.150\nespecially about the pre-project set up.\n\n345\n00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.120\nGreat series of episodes right\nthere that we need to make sure of.\n\n346\n00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.210\nWe also wanna make sure that we emphasize\nthe idea here during the initiation before\n\n347\n00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.520\nany work gets done.\n\n348\n00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.450\nThat we're aligning\nthe stakeholder's expectation\n\n349\n00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:39.040\nwith the overall project's purpose.\n\n350\n00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:43.310\nIt's very easy to assume that you know\nwhat your stakeholder's believe, and\n\n351\n00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.250\nat this point, that's not what you want.\n\n352\n00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.340\nYou wanna make sure that before\nany work gets done that you are,\n\n353\n00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:51.170\nthat your stakeholders and\nwhat they're expecting from this\n\n354\n00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:54.110\nis actually lining up to what you\nbelieve you're gonna produce.\n\n355\n00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.930\nThis is the time you hash that out, okay?\n\n356\n00:18:55.930 --> 00:19:00.160\nYou don't wanna hash it out when you've\nalready begun the processes and started\n\n357\n00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.220\nthe actual work and then some stakeholder\ngoes well, that's not what I agreed to.\n\n358\n00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.110\nNow is the time to do something like this,\n\n359\n00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.910\nis during that initiation,\nis what we want to do.\n\n360\n00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:14.410\nAlso, clearly we start to put into writing\nand this is the initiation here, okay?\n\n361\n00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.450\nAs well, the scope and\n\n362\n00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:20.420\nthe objectives, clarify anything\nthat needs to be clarified,\n\n363\n00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:25.580\nunderstand the limitations of your project\nin what it will do and what it wont do.\n\n364\n00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.320\nVery clear here, or\nwe end up with what some,\n\n365\n00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.150\nagain we've actually seen this\na couple of times in our chatroom,\n\n366\n00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.740\nwhere somebody has mentioned\nthe term scope creep.\n\n367\n00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.684\nScope creep is fairly easy.\n\n368\n00:19:35.684 --> 00:19:39.869\nIt is now when that project that was\nactually assigned to do one thing and\n\n369\n00:19:39.869 --> 00:19:42.053\nmore and more elements get added in.\n\n370\n00:19:42.053 --> 00:19:45.636\nAnd now all of a sudden the scope of\nthe project is much bigger than what it\n\n371\n00:19:45.636 --> 00:19:48.360\nwas originally designed to do, okay?\n\n372\n00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:53.460\nWe also wanna make sure that we\nshow how the participation in\n\n373\n00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:59.020\nthe project itself and processes\nhelp set the project up for success.\n\n374\n00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:03.190\nIn other words, justifying our project\nmanagement is what we're doing, okay?\n\n375\n00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:06.380\nWhy is our project actually gonna\nwork the way it's going to work, and\n\n376\n00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:10.170\nhow is it gonna bring it to its\ncompletion, and then the overall vision.\n\n377\n00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:13.730\nNow this is all clear, and you might\nactually have to do this right now,\n\n378\n00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:18.450\nbecause remember that as a project\nmanager, you may work on a small enough\n\n379\n00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:21.350\nproject where you're actually\nnot only the manager itself but\n\n380\n00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:22.780\nalso the one doing the work.\n\n381\n00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.766\nBut most of the time,\nyou're actually having to work with teams.\n\n382\n00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:28.643\nSometimes it maybe with people\nthat you don't even know.\n\n383\n00:20:28.643 --> 00:20:33.079\nAnd they have to people able to see there\nbeing value and benefit, and why they need\n\n384\n00:20:33.079 --> 00:20:37.018\nto be a part of this particular project\nto make sure it's accomplished.\n\n385\n00:20:37.018 --> 00:20:40.471\nSo those are the elements that\nwe generally see inside of that\n\n386\n00:20:40.471 --> 00:20:41.629\ninitiation phase.\n\n387\n00:20:41.629 --> 00:20:42.538\n>> Then Ronnie,\n\n388\n00:20:42.538 --> 00:20:47.552\nthat moves us right into the planning\nphase which is the next phase in the line.\n\n389\n00:20:47.552 --> 00:20:53.595\n>> It's the next phase and also arguably\nthe most important phase in what we do.\n\n390\n00:20:53.595 --> 00:20:58.401\nAnd we mention this in our cliches that we\nsay that we're not gonna be cliche, but\n\n391\n00:20:58.401 --> 00:21:01.596\nwe are, when we fail the plan,\nwe plan the fail yeah.\n\n392\n00:21:01.596 --> 00:21:07.750\nAnd that particular idea is pretty much a\nkey element inside of project management.\n\n393\n00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:11.440\nYou end up seeing project\nmanagement failures a lot of times\n\n394\n00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.080\nduring the execution and\nthe monitoring and controlling time.\n\n395\n00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.900\nAnd when you find it, it's not normally\nthe very fact that it was executed poorly,\n\n396\n00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.270\nbut it's that it was planned poorly,\nis what you tend to see.\n\n397\n00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:27.890\nAnd so, it's a mistake that happened\nduring planning, but now, you've actually\n\n398\n00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:31.710\ngotten the same orders and you're not\nactually supposed to deviate from that and\n\n399\n00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.670\nyou go well, am I still supposed\nto produce that anyways?\n\n400\n00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.440\nAnd somebody says,\nwell that's the way it's written up, so\n\n401\n00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.710\nlet's go ahead and do it.\n\n402\n00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:39.540\nNo matter what you say at that point,\nright?\n\n403\n00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.060\nThat's the way it's gonna happen.\n\n404\n00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.530\nSo, planning is one of the most\nimportant elements that we have.\n\n405\n00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.196\nRemember that when we start\ntalking about at this point,\n\n406\n00:21:47.196 --> 00:21:49.757\nwe're moving away from high\nlevel thinking, right?\n\n407\n00:21:49.757 --> 00:21:52.940\nAnd we're moving away from that\nidea that it needs to be done and\n\n408\n00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.504\nthat we're justifying it to now saying,\nhow do we get it done, okay?\n\n409\n00:21:56.504 --> 00:22:00.970\nAnd so that's why we talk about\nproject goals now are broken down into\n\n410\n00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:03.753\nmanageable work, is what we're saying.\n\n411\n00:22:03.753 --> 00:22:05.177\nNow, that is to key on.\n\n412\n00:22:05.177 --> 00:22:10.015\nWe're not talking about breaking it down\ninto actual work that needs to be done.\n\n413\n00:22:10.015 --> 00:22:15.131\nBut how much can I actually\nassign Daniel to manage, okay?\n\n414\n00:22:15.131 --> 00:22:17.224\nThat's what we're taking a look at, right?\n\n415\n00:22:17.224 --> 00:22:22.097\nSo it's very easy especially if you're\na functional person that came off working\n\n416\n00:22:22.097 --> 00:22:26.631\non the line, the thing what it means is\nhow much work can Daniel actually do.\n\n417\n00:22:26.631 --> 00:22:31.448\nIt's not that, it's actually how much\nwork can Daniel manage by himself,\n\n418\n00:22:31.448 --> 00:22:32.511\ndoing it alone.\n\n419\n00:22:32.511 --> 00:22:37.137\nLet's say he works online, he can\nbruise 150 of these things by himself.\n\n420\n00:22:37.137 --> 00:22:41.839\nBut in all reality though in managing that\nif he can actually reproduce his process\n\n421\n00:22:41.839 --> 00:22:46.542\nof 150 to his entire team of 10 or 50\npeople, well that is actually a lot more\n\n422\n00:22:46.542 --> 00:22:51.131\nwork that gets accomplished and so we\nneed to actually understand that as well.\n\n423\n00:22:51.131 --> 00:22:55.224\nSo it's broken down into what we call\nManageable Work, and that's a key term for\n\n424\n00:22:55.224 --> 00:22:56.017\nus too, okay?\n\n425\n00:22:56.017 --> 00:22:59.880\nSo this is where we start creating\nthe schedule of the work and\n\n426\n00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.089\nthis is actually very important.\n\n427\n00:23:02.089 --> 00:23:06.077\nScheduling is by far one of the most\nimportant elements that we tend to focus\n\n428\n00:23:06.077 --> 00:23:08.229\nin on inside of project planning here and\n\n429\n00:23:08.229 --> 00:23:11.924\nthat is because we have what we\ncall Predecessors and Dependencies.\n\n430\n00:23:11.924 --> 00:23:16.176\nSome things have to happen before\nother things can actually continue.\n\n431\n00:23:16.176 --> 00:23:17.648\nThere are some times where,\n\n432\n00:23:17.648 --> 00:23:20.653\nwhat we have that predecessor\nthat doesn't take place and\n\n433\n00:23:20.653 --> 00:23:25.087\nthat means that something else has to wait\nuntil that element is actually completed.\n\n434\n00:23:25.087 --> 00:23:28.748\nSo scheduling this stuff to work when\nit needs to is pretty much the key,\n\n435\n00:23:28.748 --> 00:23:32.347\nand you're gonna find that this is\nsome of the hardest elements here,\n\n436\n00:23:32.347 --> 00:23:34.559\nbecause it actually may depend on timing.\n\n437\n00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:38.407\nWe've used an example before, especially\nwith the weather, that you might find\n\n438\n00:23:38.407 --> 00:23:41.751\nout that you only have a ten hour window\nbefore the weather gets so bad and\n\n439\n00:23:41.751 --> 00:23:43.501\nyou can't do anything else, okay?\n\n440\n00:23:43.501 --> 00:23:47.718\nWell are you willing to loose ten\nhours of work banking on that tomorrow\n\n441\n00:23:47.718 --> 00:23:52.378\nyou might get a full 15 hours of work in\nor do you need to actually try and say.\n\n442\n00:23:52.378 --> 00:23:54.606\nWe have this 10 hour window\nthat we're banking on now.\n\n443\n00:23:54.606 --> 00:23:56.149\nWe've got to get it scheduled and done.\n\n444\n00:23:56.149 --> 00:24:01.470\nWell, again, that's the idea here\nthat's why scheduling is so important.\n\n445\n00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:06.070\nRemember that we also want to do estimates\nfor each chunk of manageable work.\n\n446\n00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:11.310\nSo we need to be able to actually\nestimate the cost of that.\n\n447\n00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:15.740\nCost is not only in monetary terms a lot\nof times, but more importantly, especially\n\n448\n00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:19.270\nin a project, it's actually going to\nbe in time more than anything else.\n\n449\n00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:23.510\nWhat is the cost in time if I\ndon't get these elements here\n\n450\n00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:27.100\nin the way that we need to and Daniel,\nyou've worked construction in the past.\n\n451\n00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:31.880\nLet's take the idea of just concrete and\npouring concrete If those trucks\n\n452\n00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.790\nabsolutely just are sitting there\nbecause everything's not set up.\n\n453\n00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:37.440\nWhat can happen to that\nconcrete sitting there?\n\n454\n00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.180\n>> That concretes gonna harden\ninside of that concrete truck.\n\n455\n00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.380\nAnd then you just paid for\n\n456\n00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:44.290\na load of harden concrete that\nyou can't use in your project.\n\n457\n00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:49.230\nSo it does make a big difference\non managing the time correctly as\n\n458\n00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:51.500\nwell as you possibly can predict.\n\n459\n00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.285\nI mean, there's always gonna be things\nthat happen that you can't control.\n\n460\n00:24:54.285 --> 00:24:55.710\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But you do have a good idea,\n\n461\n00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:57.340\nbased off your experience and\n\n462\n00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.740\nother people's' experience around\nyou what it's gonna be like.\n\n463\n00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:00.610\nAnd if you, like Ryan said,\n\n464\n00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.780\nyou don't have things setup, what good\nis bringing the truck in gonna do?\n\n465\n00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:07.090\nIt's gonna do no good at all,\nbecause that concrete's gonna harden and\n\n466\n00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:08.260\nyou're not gonna be able to use it.\n\n467\n00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:13.230\nSo you gotta manage your time, is one of\nthe most erucial elements to a project.\n\n468\n00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:13.890\n>> No doubt.\n\n469\n00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.820\nAnd also, of course,\nhaving an effective communication plan,\n\n470\n00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:20.920\nas well as making sure that we understand\nthat everything that we're doing, okay?\n\n471\n00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.230\nAll the elements that we set\ninto planning is all about what,\n\n472\n00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:27.940\nachieving the ultimate goal of moving\nthe plan forward through the process and\n\n473\n00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.240\nthe way that we schedule it.\n\n474\n00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.400\nThe idea of moving things around is not\njust so that we can move things around,\n\n475\n00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:37.710\nit's by trying to make it more\nefficient so that the project,\n\n476\n00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:41.500\nI'm gonna say this wrong, continues\nto progress in the way it needs to.\n\n477\n00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:42.546\n>> A little tongue twister there?\n\n478\n00:25:42.546 --> 00:25:43.340\n[LAUGH]\n>> It is!\n\n479\n00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.660\nAnd don't think that I would\nnormally tongue twist that but\n\n480\n00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.670\nI did get a little bit\ntongue twisted there.\n\n481\n00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:51.530\nSo planning actually is a very\nimportant element, right?\n\n482\n00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:53.360\nThe more time that we spend in planning,\n\n483\n00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.550\nthe more that we take a look\nat those details there.\n\n484\n00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.230\nIt makes it easier for our next phase.\n\n485\n00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:59.110\n>> All right, which is executing, right?\n\n486\n00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:02.202\nAnd we don't mean the pull\nthe lever kind of executing.\n\n487\n00:26:02.202 --> 00:26:02.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No.\n\n488\n00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.900\nBut we are actually doing something,\nwe are actually starting to get wheels\n\n489\n00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.200\nmoving, things are starting to\nhappen at this phase, right?\n\n490\n00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.360\n>> That's exactly it, right?\n\n491\n00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:13.500\nThe actual work that needs to be\ndone at this particular phase, and\n\n492\n00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.150\nmaking sure that it's\nactually work on the project.\n\n493\n00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:17.460\nEverybody can look busy.\n\n494\n00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.230\nI know it's very easy, at times,\n\n495\n00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:22.240\nto think that everything's being done\nin the way that it needs to be done.\n\n496\n00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.650\nBut everybody can look busy and\nyou just assume that it's being done here.\n\n497\n00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:29.030\nWhen we get into that execution phase,\nwe need to make sure the actual work of\n\n498\n00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:34.130\nthe project is getting accomplished\nhere and that doesn't just happen, okay.\n\n499\n00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:38.120\nA project itself has so\nmany moving parts to it, so\n\n500\n00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.620\nmany different team members involved\nin it, so many different elements here.\n\n501\n00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:45.630\nThat it doesn't just get done because\nI said it needs to be done, okay?\n\n502\n00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:47.400\nIt needs to be coordinated.\n\n503\n00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.830\nIt needs to actually happen as\npeople learn how to work as a team.\n\n504\n00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:53.730\nSo this may involve things like\nyou actually doing some type of\n\n505\n00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:55.870\nteam development if you need to.\n\n506\n00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:58.210\nWe also might implement things\nlike quality assurance and\n\n507\n00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:00.610\nwe'll talk about quality\ncontrol in a little bit here.\n\n508\n00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:05.360\nbut what level are we actually going\nto accept as being acceptable work\n\n509\n00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.870\nbeing done on a project.\n\n510\n00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:10.740\nAlso, how does information get\ndistributed around, do we actually get\n\n511\n00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:15.640\nthe information we need to if everything\nis acceptable or not and then of course\n\n512\n00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.480\ninside the execution, this is where is\nactually has to be a little bit more\n\n513\n00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:24.710\ncontrolled here when we talk about\nmanaging variables to the schedule, okay.\n\n514\n00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:27.540\nThings are inevitably going to happen\nthat's not gonna be to our favor.\n\n515\n00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:29.440\nOkay?\n\n516\n00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:33.340\nSomebody calls in sick because they\nreally just can't get to work and\n\n517\n00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:36.730\nyou were counting on that ten man crew and\nnow today You have nine and\n\n518\n00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:38.780\ngo whoa that shouldn't actually matter.\n\n519\n00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:42.550\nUnless that guy actually is the one\nthat knows how to do everything.\n\n520\n00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:45.600\nHe's the guy that's missing\non the team that says no\n\n521\n00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.230\nI know how to do this element and\nnobody else does.\n\n522\n00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:51.250\nWell now all of a sudden\nyou're like who can we get?\n\n523\n00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:52.930\nWell what if you can't get anybody.\n\n524\n00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:56.120\nOkay, so that's where it is when\nsomebody like that is happening.\n\n525\n00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.100\nAnd of course the constant\nupdating of that project plan.\n\n526\n00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.200\nAnd this is something that's actually\nspecific for the project manager.\n\n527\n00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:06.340\nIt's easy as a project manager to\njust assume work's getting done.\n\n528\n00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.030\nBut you really need, you need feedback.\n\n529\n00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:11.890\nYou need a lot of things going on during\nthat project so that you can actually\n\n530\n00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:15.590\ncontinue to monitor the plan and\nverify that it's moving forward.\n\n531\n00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:20.640\nAnd again, it's that information that\nreally is where when we take a look\n\n532\n00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:24.770\nat our element here, where we don't\ntend to put the monitoring and\n\n533\n00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:28.760\ncontrolling as sequential\nafter the execution, but\n\n534\n00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:32.010\nwe're getting the feedback and\ninformation right here.\n\n535\n00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:37.830\nThe only way for us to talk about it is in\nsequential order, is what we have to do.\n\n536\n00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:42.570\nSo that's what we talk about here is\nour next particular progress group\n\n537\n00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.400\nwhich is gonna be the monitoring and\ncontrolling.\n\n538\n00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.570\nNotice that everything that I have\nhere talks about controls, okay, and\n\n539\n00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.960\nthis is some of the elements\nthat you have to think about.\n\n540\n00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.930\nThe monitor control in here is\ntalking about understanding where\n\n541\n00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.690\ncorrective action takes place, okay,\n\n542\n00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:02.620\nto bring the project back in line with\nthe actual plan or the schedule itself.\n\n543\n00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:05.930\nAnd that's what you're trying to do\nas you want that to go hand in hand\n\n544\n00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:07.450\nwith your execution.\n\n545\n00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:09.290\nAs you actually stop monitoring and\n\n546\n00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:13.380\ncontrolling, this is when the execution\ncan lose it's path, okay.\n\n547\n00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.380\nAnd then all of a sudden something\nthat should of only taken two weeks,\n\n548\n00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.670\ntakes a month at this point.\n\n549\n00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:18.660\n>> This is our sheep dog.\n\n550\n00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.480\nThis is the guy that\nmakes sure everything,\n\n551\n00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.580\nall your little sheep are going\nin the right direction.\n\n552\n00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:26.330\nThey're moving in the spots you\nwant them to be because inevitably,\n\n553\n00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.150\nleft to their own devices,\npeople will get stymied.\n\n554\n00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:32.410\nThey'll have things that distract them,\npeople come up hey can you do this for me,\n\n555\n00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:34.700\nand next thing you know they're\nnot working on your project.\n\n556\n00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.920\nSo you got to keep corrective\nmeasures in control otherwise\n\n557\n00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.890\nThis project's gonna dissolve quickly.\n\n558\n00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:43.790\n>> And it happens so quickly that\nyou just don't realize it, right?\n\n559\n00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:47.630\nSomebody says that's fine, that can\ndelay and get put off in the morrow.\n\n560\n00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:49.940\nTomorrow something else interrupts,\nand we go ahead and\n\n561\n00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.760\nwe push that back cuz we were\nable to push that back again.\n\n562\n00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.770\nSo, a lot of times the controls actually\nhappen when you set it up during planning.\n\n563\n00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:59.160\nWhen you actually say here's\nmy quality assurance,\n\n564\n00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:02.500\nin other words, this is what I\nactually accept as a workable\n\n565\n00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:06.520\nlevel of quality that I want at\nthe end of this result okay?\n\n566\n00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.310\nThat particular level of\nquality is quality assurance.\n\n567\n00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:13.070\nIn other words, you put everything in\nplace that's going to produce that level\n\n568\n00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:15.740\nbut then you put in things\nlike quality control.\n\n569\n00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:19.600\nThat absolutely has some metric that says,\nyes this is a good product,\n\n570\n00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.540\nno this isn't, and you return it.\n\n571\n00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.680\nOkay, same thing goes on in\nall these other elements.\n\n572\n00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.700\nThe good thing is you don't\nhave to do this alone.\n\n573\n00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.830\nIn the call side,\n\n574\n00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:31.200\nyou might depend on the project accountant\nto be able to do stuff like that.\n\n575\n00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.160\nOkay, but you still actually\nhave to monitor the scope by\n\n576\n00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.460\ngetting regular reports\nthat you need in here.\n\n577\n00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.410\nAs well as take a look at\nthe risks that are in place.\n\n578\n00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:41.910\nAnd this is where that good\ncommunication comes in.\n\n579\n00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:43.380\nYou need to make sure that you do that,\n\n580\n00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.070\nand you need to do that\nat regular intervals.\n\n581\n00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:49.370\nDon't just say, well,\nhow did you do at the end of it?\n\n582\n00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:52.040\nYou actually need to say, when it starts.\n\n583\n00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.150\nDid you start on the day that you set it?\n\n584\n00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:57.130\nOkay.\nI'm going to check in with you in 36 hours\n\n585\n00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:01.200\nor 20 or 48 hours and see if you're\nactually where you need to be.\n\n586\n00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.720\n>> Yeah, you gotta find\nproblems as soon as possible.\n\n587\n00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.920\nOtherwise they tend to tail\nspin out of control and\n\n588\n00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:12.260\nnow you've gone three days,\nfive days, two weeks, with a problem.\n\n589\n00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:12.970\nNow what do you gotta do?\n\n590\n00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:14.060\nYou've gotta back track.\n\n591\n00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:14.610\nYou gotta go back.\n\n592\n00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:16.890\nWhat if I use the wrong\nbolts on this structure,\n\n593\n00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:18.280\nand they're not structurally sound?\n\n594\n00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.750\nI gotta take it completely apart.\n\n595\n00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.050\nHow long is that gonna take me?\n\n596\n00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:22.310\nGet the correct bolts.\n\n597\n00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:24.500\nI've wasted money on the wrong bolts..\n\n598\n00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:28.030\nThen redo the work to get it back\nto where it's supposed to be.\n\n599\n00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:31.640\nThis part right here,\nif you don't watch your quality.\n\n600\n00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you don't watch what you're doing,\n\n601\n00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.880\nyou're causing all these things we're\ntalking about putting in controls\n\n602\n00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.240\n>> And then monitoring it,\n\n603\n00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.000\nyou're just setting yourself up for\na disaster.\n\n604\n00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.874\n>> Yeah, there is no doubt that this\nis the one that will bite you, right?\n\n605\n00:31:41.874 --> 00:31:45.975\nThinking that you can take it easy\nas the execution has now happened,\n\n606\n00:31:45.975 --> 00:31:47.962\nis now beginning on everything.\n\n607\n00:31:47.962 --> 00:31:51.816\nRemember that the beginning of a project,\nright, the actual execution,\n\n608\n00:31:51.816 --> 00:31:55.364\nright when things begin Is not normally\nwhere you tend to find the best\n\n609\n00:31:55.364 --> 00:31:58.500\nmeasurements of well,\nsome type of control, right?\n\n610\n00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:02.533\nIt's when it begins to progress, and\nthen toward the ending of it, right,\n\n611\n00:32:02.533 --> 00:32:05.130\nwhen your time schedule is now crunched.\n\n612\n00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:06.770\nAnd you go all right, where are you?\n\n613\n00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:09.070\nAnd they're saying, I'm 50% done.\n\n614\n00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.230\nThat's not the time you\nwant to find that out.\n\n615\n00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:14.830\nSo at this point, this is where you\nwill get project teams that will say,\n\n616\n00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:17.280\nI can't believe you're\nwatching over me that closely.\n\n617\n00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.390\nWell, it depends on how\nmuch money is on line and\n\n618\n00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:22.160\nwho's reputation is on\nthe line at the same time.\n\n619\n00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:26.040\nSo yes, if there's any element that we\nneed to be very much vigilant about,\n\n620\n00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.720\nit's gonna be this part.\n\n621\n00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.200\nAnd that, lastly, of course,\nleads us into the idea of closing.\n\n622\n00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.790\nClosing is the formal acceptance\nof the project work itself and\n\n623\n00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:37.780\nthis can come in a couple of\ndifferent ways here, okay?\n\n624\n00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:40.390\nWe need a way to actually say\nthat everything is complete and\n\n625\n00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:43.165\nthat we can now take the resource\nthat we have assigned to our project,\n\n626\n00:32:43.165 --> 00:32:47.690\nre-assign them to other projects or\nrelease them from the project itself.\n\n627\n00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:49.740\nWe also do a full review,\n\n628\n00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.910\ncuz that way we actually learn from\nwhat we call our lessons learned here,\n\n629\n00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:56.190\nto see if another project's\nactually available for us to go on.\n\n630\n00:32:56.190 --> 00:33:00.280\nAnd then we go ahead and we hand off\nnow whatever it is that we're creating\n\n631\n00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:04.160\nto some type of operation and\nsee what happens from there.\n\n632\n00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.530\nNow, there's still things that might\nneed to be negotiated at this point\n\n633\n00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:08.760\nas far as the hand off.\n\n634\n00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.880\nYou might find out that they're saying,\nlook, we really want Daniel\n\n635\n00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.305\non board with us for the next three months\nto ensure that the training gets done.\n\n636\n00:33:15.305 --> 00:33:17.474\nWell, you can negotiate\nthat if you need to.\n\n637\n00:33:17.474 --> 00:33:20.830\nOr maybe while you're sitting alone\nknow Daniel's not gonna do that and so\n\n638\n00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:23.330\nthis is actually the end,\nhere's the product, take it or leave it,\n\n639\n00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:24.840\nand you don't want that either.\n\n640\n00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.310\nBut overall, though you have\nto actually figure that out.\n\n641\n00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:31.060\nSo, the last stage is not by far\nthe most technically challenging stage.\n\n642\n00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:34.900\nBut it is an important stage that says\nI should release all of my member,\n\n643\n00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.480\nall of the members of my project team.\n\n644\n00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:41.340\nIf not, now the actual customer or\n\n645\n00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:45.062\nwhoever it might be, comes back and says,\nwell, I really didn't like that project,\n\n646\n00:33:45.062 --> 00:33:47.640\nwell Ron, now you've released\nall your project members.\n\n647\n00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.140\nWell, now you're actually in trouble\nagain because now all the project team is\n\n648\n00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.120\ngone and dispersed in the way they want.\n\n649\n00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.220\nBut just kind of realize in\nthese different elements, right,\n\n650\n00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:59.000\nthat there are specific things\nthat are associated with them and\n\n651\n00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.750\nalso take a look at those process groups\nand know that the breakdown is actually\n\n652\n00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:05.686\nfairly simple when we start\nto begin to manage projects.\n\n653\n00:34:05.686 --> 00:34:08.400\n>> Yeah, I liked your little last\nbullet point there that said,\n\n654\n00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.970\nHand off to operations.\n\n655\n00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:11.530\nThat is the ultimate closer.\n\n656\n00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:14.780\nThe project is done, we've gone\nthrough each one of the steps, and\n\n657\n00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.120\nnow it is something we\ndo on a daily basis.\n\n658\n00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.860\nWe're not still working on it,\ntrying to figure it out.\n\n659\n00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.290\nIs this gonna work, is that gonna work?\n\n660\n00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:22.040\nNo, it's something we've figured out.\n\n661\n00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:26.550\nIt is implemented as an operational\nprocedure on a daily basis,\n\n662\n00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:27.540\nit's what we do.\n\n663\n00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:28.530\nRonnie, awesome.\n\n664\n00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:32.840\nYou've definitely taken us through each\none of these phases very, very well.\n\n665\n00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.970\nI understand them all myself,\nhopefully you guys as well.\n\n666\n00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:37.870\nIs there anything else we need to add for\nthis episode?\n\n667\n00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:40.457\n>> Well, not for this episode, but don't\nthink that we're done with, of course,\n\n668\n00:34:40.457 --> 00:34:41.180\nproject management.\n\n669\n00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:45.010\nNow you may think so, right, because we\nwent through the actual preplanning stage\n\n670\n00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:46.690\nand we talked about all the processes.\n\n671\n00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:49.290\nAnd this may give you a level\nof confidence and this should.\n\n672\n00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:52.250\nBut it doesn't mean that you know all the\nother elements that are actually involved\n\n673\n00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:53.690\nin much more detail.\n\n674\n00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:57.930\nSo, if you're still actually hankering for\nmore, as far as details go,\n\n675\n00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:00.770\nespecially in the planning stage, cuz\nthat's where we're actually gonna get into\n\n676\n00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:04.480\nthe nitty gritty of project management,\nplanning is pretty much our job.\n\n677\n00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.090\nThat we're actually gonna take\na very deep dive into it,\n\n678\n00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:10.532\na lot of episodes coming up,\nso stay tuned for more there.\n\n679\n00:35:10.532 --> 00:35:12.880\n>> All right, well thanks again Ronnie for\nstopping by and\n\n680\n00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.530\nthank you guys for watching.\n\n681\n00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:16.510\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n682\n00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:18.080\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n683\n00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:18.690\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n684\n00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.507\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n685\n00:35:20.507 --> 00:35:28.042\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.762 --> 00:00:19.746\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode, well,\n\n4\n00:00:19.746 --> 00:00:22.083\nwe're continuing on with\nour Project+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:26.517\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nis our friend and mentor, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:26.517 --> 00:00:27.907\nRonnie, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n7\n00:00:27.907 --> 00:00:29.267\n>> Appreciate being invited back,\n\n8\n00:00:29.267 --> 00:00:33.347\nas we continue to take a look\nat more of CompTIA's Project+.\n\n9\n00:00:33.347 --> 00:00:36.077\nAnd what we're actually gonna\nbe spending our time in today,\n\n10\n00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:40.057\nis to take a look at the idea of\ndifferent organizational structures.\n\n11\n00:00:40.057 --> 00:00:43.007\nAnd to actually think about where\nproject management normally fits\n\n12\n00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:44.287\ninto these structures.\n\n13\n00:00:44.287 --> 00:00:46.987\nBecause it's very important that\nwe understand that as project\n\n14\n00:00:46.987 --> 00:00:48.350\nmanagers as well.\n\n15\n00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.140\nA lot of times when we start\nto take on something new,\n\n16\n00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.400\nsomething like project management,\nit does.\n\n17\n00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.680\nIt gives us knowledge that\nwe didn't have before.\n\n18\n00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.680\nIt makes us feel very confident.\n\n19\n00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.221\nIt allows to be able to think that\nwe can accomplish everything.\n\n20\n00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:04.003\nAnd normally, though,\neven though that's all good stuff,\n\n21\n00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:06.121\nat least mentally for ourselves.\n\n22\n00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:09.878\nSometimes, you've gotta actually\nunderstand the realization though,\n\n23\n00:01:09.878 --> 00:01:12.560\nis that not every single\ncompany you end up working for\n\n24\n00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.196\nis gonna see project management in\nthe same glowing light that Daniel and\n\n25\n00:01:16.196 --> 00:01:17.882\nI are actually gonna put it into.\n\n26\n00:01:17.882 --> 00:01:20.668\nAnd so that means we actually have\nto understand how we work, and\n\n27\n00:01:20.668 --> 00:01:22.425\nactually understand the advantages and\n\n28\n00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:25.800\nbenefits to these different types\nof organizational structures.\n\n29\n00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.670\nAnd see where the project manager\nactually fits into this as well.\n\n30\n00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.280\nSo that's what we're gonna take a look at\ntoday is those organizational structures,\n\n31\n00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.490\nand we're gonna see that it breaks\ndown into five different types of\n\n32\n00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.110\norganizational structures.\n\n33\n00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.029\nI wanna take a look briefly\nat each one of those, so\n\n34\n00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:43.892\nthat we understand where we might end up,\nokay?\n\n35\n00:01:43.892 --> 00:01:48.278\nNow Daniel, we really have traditionally,\nat least in the past few episodes,\n\n36\n00:01:48.278 --> 00:01:51.092\nwe talked about where\ncompanies normally begin and\n\n37\n00:01:51.092 --> 00:01:54.112\nmost of them don't begin\nwith just projects, right?\n\n38\n00:01:54.112 --> 00:01:57.340\nSo let's take for an example,\nthe insurance company that you worked for.\n\n39\n00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.990\nI'm pretty sure there were\nprojects that went on but\n\n40\n00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.760\nit was probably set up as\ndifferent departments, right?\n\n41\n00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.580\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n42\n00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.148\nEvery department has their own set of\nprojects and goals that they're trying to\n\n43\n00:02:07.148 --> 00:02:11.664\nmeet for each year or whatever amounts\nof time we've set forth as the defacto.\n\n44\n00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:15.650\nAnd in that, we would have to\nsit across resources and staff,\n\n45\n00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.344\npersonnel I guess would be a better word.\n\n46\n00:02:18.344 --> 00:02:21.279\nAnd so that they can obtain those\nprojects, get them completed, and\n\n47\n00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.364\nthen that would benefit\nthe company in some way.\n\n48\n00:02:23.364 --> 00:02:23.998\n>> Yeah, and so\n\n49\n00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:27.950\nyou do have organizations that realize\nthat projects are very important.\n\n50\n00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.470\nAnd so, they take that time and\nthey take the money and\n\n51\n00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.540\nthey take everything into account and\nthey add that in.\n\n52\n00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.220\nBut, what if you actually end\nup working for a company,\n\n53\n00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.730\nthough, that really didn't\ntake any of that into account?\n\n54\n00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.540\nBut now realize that projects need\nto be done within the company?\n\n55\n00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.710\nSo, normally what you'd have there is what\nwe call a functional type of organization.\n\n56\n00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.720\nLet me kind of show you an organizational\nchart in which this one breaks down for\n\n57\n00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.920\nus a little bit easier for\nus to understand, right?\n\n58\n00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.330\nSo when we talk about\na traditional functional type of\n\n59\n00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.076\norganizational structure normally,\nwe do have a hierarchical structure.\n\n60\n00:03:05.076 --> 00:03:06.790\nAnd right here, at the top I just put CEO,\n\n61\n00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.990\nyou put whoever is the head\nof your organization.\n\n62\n00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.030\nAnd then from that point,\nit breaks down into departments.\n\n63\n00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.590\nAnd essentially,\n\n64\n00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.800\ndepartment heads are actually in\ncontrol at each of those departments.\n\n65\n00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.430\nThe hierarchy is there.\n\n66\n00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.410\nA staff from, lets say, Human Resources,\ndoesn't directly report to the Finances,\n\n67\n00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.260\nor Marketing, or even directly to the CEO.\n\n68\n00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.220\nUsually, the people within that particular\norganizational structure, let's say under\n\n69\n00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.620\nHuman Resources and they report to\nanybody, is gonna be their one direct\n\n70\n00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.830\nsupervisor above them inside of that\nHuman Resources department itself, okay?\n\n71\n00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.510\nSo, when you have all those\nstructures in place and now,\n\n72\n00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.900\nyou realize that projects\nactually need to take place.\n\n73\n00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.010\nAnd the company now\nhires a Project Manager,\n\n74\n00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.760\nwhere does he fit in to this\norganizational structure?\n\n75\n00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.240\nIs he a part of the human resources team?\n\n76\n00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.814\nIs he part of finances, marketing,\nproduction, customer relations?\n\n77\n00:03:59.814 --> 00:04:02.872\nDoes he work hand in hand with the CEO?\n\n78\n00:04:02.872 --> 00:04:06.999\nWell, in this type of structure,\nbecause a hierarchy has existed,\n\n79\n00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:09.572\na form line type of structure has existed.\n\n80\n00:04:09.572 --> 00:04:14.511\nIt doesn't mean that the Project Manager\nactually fits very neatly in to any one of\n\n81\n00:04:14.511 --> 00:04:15.737\nthese categories.\n\n82\n00:04:15.737 --> 00:04:20.745\nAnd so you can imagine then,\nif you had several department heads,\n\n83\n00:04:20.745 --> 00:04:22.897\nand now CEO Dan Lowrie says.\n\n84\n00:04:22.897 --> 00:04:27.900\nHey, I wanna introduce you guys to\nsomeone which is a Project Manager.\n\n85\n00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.020\nWell, imagine what they're thinking.\n\n86\n00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.490\nImagine these department heads going,\n\n87\n00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.840\nwhoa, wait a minute,\nwhy is the CEO introducing this guy?\n\n88\n00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.440\nHe doesn't have a department behind him,\nhe's just a Project Manager.\n\n89\n00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.172\nSo where does he fit in?\n\n90\n00:04:40.172 --> 00:04:44.800\nThat's a hard place to be in this type\nof organization, is to realize something\n\n91\n00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.752\nthat, hey, this guy was hired by\nthe CEO to get some projects done.\n\n92\n00:04:48.752 --> 00:04:52.215\nAnd what does that mean, that he's\nactually gonna be a Project Manager, and\n\n93\n00:04:52.215 --> 00:04:53.720\nhe's just told all of us up here.\n\n94\n00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.560\nWe're actually the department heads.\n\n95\n00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.730\nDoes he have more authority than we do?\n\n96\n00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.670\nHow is this actually gonna end up working?\n\n97\n00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.200\nSo you can see why this\nmight actually be something,\n\n98\n00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.100\nwhich is a little bit more daunting.\n\n99\n00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.770\nAnd why in a functional organization,\nProject Managers and\n\n100\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.810\nproject management seem to be more of\na side type of thing that's done, right.\n\n101\n00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.470\nA side project, this is something\npersonal the CEO wants to see done, and\n\n102\n00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.300\nhe's actually who's hired\nto do something like this.\n\n103\n00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.840\nSo, when you start seeing that,\nyou can realize,\n\n104\n00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.550\nthen, that the Project Manager\ndoes not have an easy time\n\n105\n00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.180\nin getting the projects done that\nhe believes that should be done.\n\n106\n00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.360\nDon't get me wrong,\nin this particular type of organization,\n\n107\n00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.980\na project manager's\nauthority is relatively low.\n\n108\n00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.940\nIn comparison, and what has to happen\nhere is that the Project Manager,\n\n109\n00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.430\nhe has to be able to influence to\nget his project team built, so\n\n110\n00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.610\nthat he can get his project accomplished.\n\n111\n00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.620\nNow, who does he actually work on?\n\n112\n00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.940\nWell, what I did is,\nI made this kind of oval here to try and\n\n113\n00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.390\nhelp us to understand his sphere\nof influence at this point.\n\n114\n00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.370\nIs at more than likely for\nhim to be able to get his projects done.\n\n115\n00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.310\nHe's gonna need to be able to influence\nessentially those department heads, okay?\n\n116\n00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.370\nSo, even though he has a project\nthat he knows that needs to be done.\n\n117\n00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.920\nThis particular type of Project Manager\nreally doesn't have any real authority to\n\n118\n00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.312\nbe able to go into every one of\nthese departments here and say.\n\n119\n00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:21.919\nI need two people from\nthe marketing department,\n\n120\n00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.712\nI need another person from Production,\nI need this,\n\n121\n00:06:24.712 --> 00:06:28.870\nand just send them to me, and\nwe're gonna work on our project, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.380\nHe really doesn't.\n\n123\n00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.380\nDaniel, can you guess what in\nthe world this Project Manager\n\n124\n00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.840\nmay have to do to be able to\nget one of those resources in?\n\n125\n00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.554\n>> He's probably gotta grease\na lot of pockets or palms or\n\n126\n00:06:38.554 --> 00:06:41.332\nwhatever it is you line the pockets or\ngrease the palms.\n\n127\n00:06:41.332 --> 00:06:44.167\nI think what I'm getting from you here,\nRonnie,\n\n128\n00:06:44.167 --> 00:06:47.613\nis that in this functional type\nof organizational structure\n\n129\n00:06:47.613 --> 00:06:52.060\nthe Project Manager seems to have more\ninfluence than he does authority.\n\n130\n00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.910\nHe works through influencing, saying,\nhey, human resources manager,\n\n131\n00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.620\nman it'd be nice if I could get a couple\nof your guys, would that be possible?\n\n132\n00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.600\nWhere he doesn't have the direct\nauthority to go, human resources manager\n\n133\n00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.280\ngive me two of your people right now and\nI need them for my project.\n\n134\n00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.120\n>> And that's exactly what has to happen,\nright?\n\n135\n00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.270\nThe Project Manager is not here to\nchange the entire organization.\n\n136\n00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.352\nHe's working through\nthe existing structures.\n\n137\n00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:18.979\nAnd that means if he does need somebody\nfrom the finances department or\n\n138\n00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:21.012\nthe human resources department here.\n\n139\n00:07:21.012 --> 00:07:23.154\nHe really does need to go\nto the Project Manager and\n\n140\n00:07:23.154 --> 00:07:25.340\nestablish fairly solid relationships.\n\n141\n00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.425\nNow I'm not gonna go as far as\nDaniel in bribing those guys.\n\n142\n00:07:27.425 --> 00:07:29.025\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, I'm joking.\n\n143\n00:07:29.025 --> 00:07:30.765\n>> That's how business is done.\n\n144\n00:07:30.765 --> 00:07:33.264\n>> But that's what has to happen, right?\n\n145\n00:07:33.264 --> 00:07:37.976\nHe really does need to establish a very\ngood and cordial relationship with\n\n146\n00:07:37.976 --> 00:07:43.060\nthese guys that then will be able to\nwork with him and be able to help him.\n\n147\n00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.330\nAs he actually influences them to say,\nhey, here's a project needs to be done.\n\n148\n00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.890\nHey, can you help me figure out\nwho I need to get to do this?\n\n149\n00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:52.780\nAnd so it does have to happen there.\n\n150\n00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.229\nNow, in this type of organization,\nthe reason he has to do that,\n\n151\n00:07:56.229 --> 00:08:00.306\nif he just goes in and says, okay,\nI'm gonna take this guy from Marketing And\n\n152\n00:08:00.306 --> 00:08:03.476\nthere's something big in\nmarketing that needs to be done.\n\n153\n00:08:03.476 --> 00:08:07.009\nThat marketing executive at that point\nis probably not gonna be very happy with\n\n154\n00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:10.541\nthe project manager who just takes away\nhis best person on the staff right there\n\n155\n00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:14.052\nso that he can work on the side project\nand leaves him with the rest of the team.\n\n156\n00:08:14.052 --> 00:08:17.200\nIt's not that the team shouldn't\nbe able to handle it, but\n\n157\n00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.310\nnow that he's taken the key player out,\nit's not one of those.\n\n158\n00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.830\nSo what has to happen, then, is that\nthere is this divided authority, right?\n\n159\n00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.970\nIf the marketing goes to that person that\nDaniel says he wants on his project team.\n\n160\n00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.290\nSays, no, you're not working on that.\n\n161\n00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.280\nYou're working on my stuff.\n\n162\n00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.650\nAnd now you can imagine that staff member\ngoing, well, who the heck do I listen to?\n\n163\n00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.470\nWho should I actually be\nresponding to at this point?\n\n164\n00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:43.160\nThe project manager says,\nyes, you're working for me.\n\n165\n00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:47.170\nBut the guy that hired me, the guy\nthat actually hired me is saying no,\n\n166\n00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.420\nyou're working for me,\nnow what ends up happening.\n\n167\n00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.300\nWell, what you see there, right,\nis now you got some type of tension now\n\n168\n00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.490\nbetween the project manager and\none of these functional heads.\n\n169\n00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.960\nAnd you can imagine if tension is bad\neven within a regular department,\n\n170\n00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.580\nnow imagine it between departments.\n\n171\n00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.860\nAnd they're now struggling for resources.\n\n172\n00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.320\nAnd you can see why something\nlike this would happen.\n\n173\n00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.810\nNow the neat thing about this\ntype of traditional structure\n\n174\n00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:14.570\nis that there are advantages for the staff\nmember, for whoever's actually in there.\n\n175\n00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:19.030\nIt's a fairly solid and stable type\nof environment in which, really,\n\n176\n00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.710\nyou have the ability to make your mark and\n\n177\n00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.440\nactually establish yourself as\nsomeone that that team can depend on.\n\n178\n00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.620\nBut the very fact is doing something\nlike that actually does work out for\n\n179\n00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.110\nyou, but\na lot of times it also restricts you too.\n\n180\n00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:37.140\nYou might find it not easy to move from\none department to another one because\n\n181\n00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.460\nthey depend on you now so much so\nthat when you go hey I wanna move.\n\n182\n00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.720\nAnd that manager goes no, there's no way,\nwe need you here on this team.\n\n183\n00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.050\nWell, you have divided loyalties.\n\n184\n00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.860\nYou have a lot of\ndifferent things going on.\n\n185\n00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.190\nSo you do have to worry\nabout something like this.\n\n186\n00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.850\nInside the project management perspective,\n\n187\n00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.610\nwhen you start taking a look at\na functional relationship like this,\n\n188\n00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:00.330\nthere's several things we\nneed to take a look at.\n\n189\n00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.830\nSo let me switch my view here for\na moment.\n\n190\n00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:07.460\nAnd I made this table of sorts to try and\nhelp us out, and I'm hoping that we\n\n191\n00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.610\ncan see it, let me go ahead and\nzoom in just a little bit more here.\n\n192\n00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.070\nI'm not gonna tell you it's\nthe best zoom in the world but\n\n193\n00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.220\nlet's just do one more here and\nthat way we'll take a look, okay?\n\n194\n00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.060\nSo we're gonna focus in on this,\n\n195\n00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.640\nwe're gonna come back to this\nchart a couple of different times.\n\n196\n00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.790\nSo here's what the breakdown turns out\nto be then in a functional relationship.\n\n197\n00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.630\nAnd what ends up happening, okay?\n\n198\n00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:32.370\nSo if we are in that functional type\nof organization, what we're gonna\n\n199\n00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:36.060\nend up seeing as the project\nmanager authority is little or non.\n\n200\n00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.650\nIt really has to be based around the idea\n\n201\n00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:43.380\nof being able to influence those heads\nof departments that you have, okay?\n\n202\n00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.100\nSo what authority does you have then?\n\n203\n00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.310\nHe has the authority to\nchoose his own project.\n\n204\n00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:48.730\nHe can't assign team members to it.\n\n205\n00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.390\nHe can't even order a team\nmember to do anything.\n\n206\n00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:55.410\nHe just pretty much is kind of\nactually there to coordinate and\n\n207\n00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:59.470\nto work and integrate all\nthose resources he can, okay?\n\n208\n00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:02.390\nThe other thing that he has to be\naware of here is resource availability\n\n209\n00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.290\ncan also be little to none in this way.\n\n210\n00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.060\nNow I've actually influenced a particular\nstaff member to say they wanna work on\n\n211\n00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.100\nmy project.\n\n212\n00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:15.040\nBut I didn't do it with Daniel's\nknowledge of doing it, and\n\n213\n00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.520\nnow Daniel's a little bit more upset, and\n>> You did not get my blessing.\n\n214\n00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.530\n>> I did not get your blessing, and\nthat's what it comes down to, right?\n\n215\n00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:26.420\nNow all of a sudden, the chance of having\nthat person on my project team Daniel says\n\n216\n00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.890\nYeah, it's not gonna happen.\n\n217\n00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:29.190\n>> Yeah, people start getting vindictive.\n\n218\n00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.150\n>> That's when this stuff happens.\n\n219\n00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.000\n>> And then they start fighting.\n\n220\n00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.800\nYou don't want that.\n\n221\n00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.960\nYou want to avoid that.\n\n222\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.896\nSo as this type of project manager,\nRonnie's really hitting it on the nose.\n\n223\n00:11:35.896 --> 00:11:40.700\nHe's driving that point home is, you need\nto build a good working relationship\n\n224\n00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.350\nwith all those department heads.\n\n225\n00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.240\nSo that they'll be more amicable\nwhen it comes time to requesting\n\n226\n00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.480\nresources from them.\n\n227\n00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.320\n>> Yep, no doubt.\n\n228\n00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.860\nAnd then, of course,\nwhen it comes down to the budget then for\n\n229\n00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:55.010\nthe project, even though he has his own\nproject and may have his own budget here,\n\n230\n00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:57.130\nhe really doesn't get to use\nit the way that he needs to.\n\n231\n00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:57.850\nRight?\n\n232\n00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.350\nIt does come down to that\nfunctional manager that\n\n233\n00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.160\nhas the resources that he needs.\n\n234\n00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.420\nThat says what,\nyou said that you need them for\n\n235\n00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.800\n40 hours, I can give them to you for 10.\n\n236\n00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.880\nWell now, who's really in control\nof that budget at that point,\n\n237\n00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:10.940\nif you think about it.\n\n238\n00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.430\nIt really is the functional\nmanger as well.\n\n239\n00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:18.320\nAnd as far as the project manager roll,\nat least to the entire organization right?\n\n240\n00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.470\nBecause he's working between departments.\n\n241\n00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:24.330\nHe's not really full time, he's full\ntime as far as his title goes, but\n\n242\n00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:28.680\nwhen it comes down to it the only\ninfluence he really has is part time.\n\n243\n00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.200\nHe might be able to get somebody\non my team to work for him for\n\n244\n00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.370\nthree hours this week.\n\n245\n00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.530\nOkay, well that's not full time at all.\n\n246\n00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.660\nAnd the same thing with the actual staff\nhere that ends up working on this project.\n\n247\n00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.660\nThey're usually having\nto split their duties.\n\n248\n00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.742\nThey still have to meet the demands and\nthe job requirements, so\n\n249\n00:12:45.742 --> 00:12:47.797\ntheir functional role that they have, but\n\n250\n00:12:47.797 --> 00:12:51.440\nat the same time still be able to\ndo the project management staff.\n\n251\n00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.880\nSo in this type of organization you\nmay find yourself in especially it was\n\n252\n00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.590\na functional type of organization and\nthat were most of us begin.\n\n253\n00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:04.220\nAs we begin to learn how to do this by\nbeing able to coordinate these activities,\n\n254\n00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.380\nand again, you realizing that\nyou may have very little or\n\n255\n00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:12.000\neven no authority a lot of times when\nyou start seeing something like this.\n\n256\n00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.580\nOkay.\n\n257\n00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.320\nSo that functional role is fairly common.\n\n258\n00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.660\nYou gotta realize that you may\nsee that a lot more often.\n\n259\n00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.490\nNow I would say that 15 years\nago you would have seen that\n\n260\n00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:22.880\njust about everywhere.\n\n261\n00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:27.190\nBut now as companies have tried\nto become more, the key and\n\n262\n00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.470\ncool term in IT, we're more agile.\n\n263\n00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:34.790\nIn other words, able to change, able\nto switch a little bit faster then yes.\n\n264\n00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.310\nThis has not become so important.\n\n265\n00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:40.600\nBut the very fact is it's easy to\nhave that hierarchy in the know.\n\n266\n00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.030\nThat know in two years Daniel\nsays I'm gonna get a promotion.\n\n267\n00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:47.840\nSo I'm sticking it out right here rather\nthan going on this fancy little trip with\n\n268\n00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.060\nthe project manager, and doing this thing\nwhich may make me a star for two months.\n\n269\n00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.290\nBut I know that I have my future here.\n\n270\n00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.720\nAnd you stick with\nthe functionality instead.\n\n271\n00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.270\nNow along with that type of style,\nof course,\n\n272\n00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:03.750\nare three different types of what\nwe call Matrix styles, okay and\n\n273\n00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:08.520\nyou might hear the term weak, balanced and\nstrong matrix types of organization and so\n\n274\n00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.480\nwe wanna share you an example\nof each of this as well.\n\n275\n00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.970\nSo, I'm gonna take the same basic\ntype of organizational chart and\n\n276\n00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.610\nthen show you kind of something\na little bit different here.\n\n277\n00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.060\nSo, here's the functional one.\n\n278\n00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.630\nSo, Daniel I wanna see if you can\nactually notice this here, okay.\n\n279\n00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.440\nSo here's the functional one,\nI'm gonna move this down here for\n\n280\n00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.400\na moment, and here is the weak one.\n\n281\n00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.200\nDo you see much of a difference at all?\n\n282\n00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.460\n>> Looking pretty similar to me, Ronnie.\n\n283\n00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.500\n>> Yeah, it really doesn't look\nany different at all here so\n\n284\n00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.900\nwhen you start taking a look,\n\n285\n00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.840\nwell what the heck then is the difference\nbetween a functional and weak?\n\n286\n00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.130\nThere really isn't much, except for\nthe level of influence and\n\n287\n00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:47.830\nwhere the influence comes in.\n\n288\n00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:52.910\nSo remember here at the functional level,\nyou really need to coordinate through\n\n289\n00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:58.220\nthat particular,\nthe heads of those departments there.\n\n290\n00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.200\nHere at the weak matrix level, though,\n\n291\n00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:07.710\nyou actually do have just a little bit of\nauthority or maybe even now and again, but\n\n292\n00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:13.110\nyou actually can influence people to\ncome on your particular staff directly.\n\n293\n00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.760\nSo, you're actually\ngiven kind of that bit.\n\n294\n00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.710\nJust a little bit here.\n\n295\n00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:18.810\nI'm not telling you it's a ton.\n\n296\n00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.940\nBut just a little bit to be\nable to do something like this.\n\n297\n00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.320\nWhen you start having\nsomething like this here,\n\n298\n00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.740\nessentially the request still is the same.\n\n299\n00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:31.360\nThe functional manager, though, just tells\nyou, here is who's gonna be on your team.\n\n300\n00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.850\nThey've essentially been told by whoever\nit is that hey, you're gonna assign\n\n301\n00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.890\nsomebody to the project manager team and\nyou can imagine how well that floats over.\n\n302\n00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:39.690\nRight, Daniel?\n\n303\n00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:44.300\nThat hey, you've got four people, I'm\ngoing to take away one to actually work\n\n304\n00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.930\non this project,\nDaniel do you care who it is?\n\n305\n00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.960\nWell yeah I care, well that's the one\nthat you're gonna assign to Ronnie's\n\n306\n00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.240\nproject management team.\n\n307\n00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:56.080\nYou guess that that makes that functional\nmanager warm and fluffy inside don't you?\n\n308\n00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.709\n>> Yeah, you tell them that yeah\nyou need to get Johnny in here.\n\n309\n00:15:58.709 --> 00:16:00.120\nYou're thinking about\nfiring him anyway so.\n\n310\n00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:04.194\n[LAUGH] They go after, okay well that's\nwho I'm going to get is good old Johnny.\n\n311\n00:16:04.194 --> 00:16:06.233\n>> Yeah, at this point though,\n\n312\n00:16:06.233 --> 00:16:11.047\nwhat you really do have is you should\nhave the ability then to kind of put\n\n313\n00:16:11.047 --> 00:16:15.638\na team together of competent\nresources that you can actually use.\n\n314\n00:16:15.638 --> 00:16:20.090\nBut now, you actually do have to\ncoordinate these on your own, okay?\n\n315\n00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:23.140\nYou're not gonna expect much help\nfrom those functional managers cuz\n\n316\n00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.460\nthey're already saying what,\nI've already given you all the help,\n\n317\n00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.750\nyou've kind of already robbed\nsomebody from my team.\n\n318\n00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.120\nNow let's put it in\nan adversarial condition,\n\n319\n00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.990\nI shouldn't say that all the time.\n\n320\n00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:33.380\nBut a lot of times it really is.\n\n321\n00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.150\nIt could be that you really\nhave pulled somebody off\n\n322\n00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:37.800\nwhen you really needed them right then.\n\n323\n00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.310\nAnd so, you just kinda realized that that\nmay actually end up happening as well.\n\n324\n00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:46.040\nSo, in this particular relationship,\nnotice that, okay?\n\n325\n00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:50.330\nHere in the weak matrix, you do have the\nability to affect your own team because\n\n326\n00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:55.730\nthey're saying, you've got your team,\nso now you have to work here.\n\n327\n00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:59.730\nBut it doesn't actually take away\nthe authority of the functional manager\n\n328\n00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:03.400\nas far as the level of work that\nthey're required to do for them.\n\n329\n00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.040\nSo, when you start to take a look\nat something like that and\n\n330\n00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.670\nyou compare that over here.\n\n331\n00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:11.600\nHere you really are, you're actually kind\nof coordinating and schmoozing a lot and\n\n332\n00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.460\nyou're trying to get people onto\nyour team the way that you want to.\n\n333\n00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.730\nHere you've got your teams assigned, but\nyou still have to smooth things over as\n\n334\n00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.600\nwell, because they still have\nwork to do for others too.\n\n335\n00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:26.538\nNow, when we take a look down here\nat the weak matrixed idea, okay?\n\n336\n00:17:26.538 --> 00:17:30.861\nYour authority is low, and\nthe reason why is that your authority\n\n337\n00:17:30.861 --> 00:17:34.798\nis actually by a dictate more\nthan anything else, right?\n\n338\n00:17:34.798 --> 00:17:38.390\nThe CEO says Daniel, you're gonna\nassign two people to this team.\n\n339\n00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:39.960\nNo, I need those two people.\n\n340\n00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:43.380\nWell, Ronnie needs his project done,\nand he needs two people from your team.\n\n341\n00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.500\nYou just pick which two, okay?\n\n342\n00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.400\nWell, that is authority,\n\n343\n00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.970\nthat comes through the project\nmanager that he says what?\n\n344\n00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:51.700\nProject manager can go to\nDaniel at any time and\n\n345\n00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.580\nsay, I'm taking two people from your team.\n\n346\n00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:59.510\nAnd Daniel can say, well, okay, and\nnow he still has to get the work done.\n\n347\n00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:02.940\nIt doesn't mean he has to lessen\nthe requirement on those two people.\n\n348\n00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:03.630\nHe can sit there and\n\n349\n00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:08.250\nsay look, you can work on this project,\nas long as you get my work done too.\n\n350\n00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.020\nSo you gotta realize\nthat you still have that.\n\n351\n00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.300\n>> Sounds like it's worse for\n\n352\n00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:15.210\nthe employees being requisitioned\nthan it is for anybody else.\n\n353\n00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.200\n>> It is actually worse for them,\n\n354\n00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.900\ndepending on the situation\nthat ends up happening.\n\n355\n00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:24.320\nEspecially, if that project manager\nhasn't done some of the smoothing\n\n356\n00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.300\nthat he needs to at the beginning.\n\n357\n00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:31.490\nAnd he walks in and say by fiat here,\nthat hey, this is what the guy wants,\n\n358\n00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.800\nthis is how I'm gonna do it and\nhe just essentially takes that.\n\n359\n00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.590\nSo, you gotta realize.\n\n360\n00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:40.547\nResource availability, again,\nis gonna actually be low as well and\n\n361\n00:18:40.547 --> 00:18:43.698\nthat's because you're gonna\nget a couple of things.\n\n362\n00:18:43.698 --> 00:18:49.211\nIf the CEO says to the functional manager,\nyou pick the two,\n\n363\n00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:53.118\nwell, who is Daniel likely going to pick?\n\n364\n00:18:53.118 --> 00:18:58.059\nExcept for the guy that he just hired that\nhe realized that doesn't really know much\n\n365\n00:18:58.059 --> 00:19:00.538\nand so, yeah sure, go ahead and do that.\n\n366\n00:19:00.538 --> 00:19:04.796\nSo let him kind of train them\nup in something else and\n\n367\n00:19:04.796 --> 00:19:08.470\nmaybe after a while,\nget them back as well.\n\n368\n00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:11.140\nSo you just kind of have to\nrealize that you don't have that.\n\n369\n00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:11.710\nAnd once again,\n\n370\n00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:16.140\nyou still have that unusual idea here,\nthat it manages a project budget.\n\n371\n00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:20.640\nWell, again, even though the project\nmanager himself may have a budget,\n\n372\n00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.640\nhe really can't control it, okay?\n\n373\n00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.470\nSo the true controller of that budget\nis actually gonna be where that\n\n374\n00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:29.140\nfunctional manager said yes,\nhe can have it, or no you can't.\n\n375\n00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:34.110\nSame thing at the point here, Part Time,\nPart Time is far as this staff goes\n\n376\n00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:36.260\nbecause they're still gonna\nhave to accomplish work.\n\n377\n00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:41.510\nAnd his influence is actually not gonna be\nwhat their direct manager a lot of times.\n\n378\n00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:43.988\nIt's gonna be, hey,\ndid you get my project done?\n\n379\n00:19:43.988 --> 00:19:47.568\nNo, Daniel said I had\nto get this done today.\n\n380\n00:19:47.568 --> 00:19:52.290\nIt's still part time, so you're still\nactually gonna end up seeing that as well,\n\n381\n00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:52.968\nall right?\n\n382\n00:19:52.968 --> 00:19:56.254\nSo, those are kind of\nthe two that you tend to see,\n\n383\n00:19:56.254 --> 00:20:00.968\nwhen organizations actually started\noff with no project teams at all.\n\n384\n00:20:00.968 --> 00:20:04.034\nAnd then, an organization saying,\nwe realize that we need it but\n\n385\n00:20:04.034 --> 00:20:05.650\nwe don't exactly know.\n\n386\n00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.450\nBut essentially, the CEO comes in and\nsays, we're gonna have\n\n387\n00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.350\na Project Manager and you're gonna\nassign somebody to the team and\n\n388\n00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.060\nthat's where that Weak Matrix comes in.\n\n389\n00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:17.960\nThe Project Manager really doesn't have\nany super or any real authority yet.\n\n390\n00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.417\nHis particular matter and influence is\ncoordination, integration, and of course,\n\n391\n00:20:22.417 --> 00:20:23.338\njust influence.\n\n392\n00:20:23.338 --> 00:20:26.110\nWhether its actually at\nthe department head level or\n\n393\n00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:29.630\nwhat is actually with its the staff\ninside those departments.\n\n394\n00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:33.700\n>> Yeah, now, Ronnie,\nnow it's not the only matrix game in town,\n\n395\n00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:39.178\nI know there's a more zen-like approach,\nmore balanced approach to these matrices.\n\n396\n00:20:39.178 --> 00:20:41.878\n>> Their normally is, okay?\n\n397\n00:20:41.878 --> 00:20:44.660\nDepending on the size of the organization.\n\n398\n00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:49.020\nIn a balanced matrix approach here,\nI just did one of these instead.\n\n399\n00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.240\nWhat you'll end up seeing\ninstead is that the CEO does not\n\n400\n00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.440\nbring in a Project Manager for\nthe whole company and\n\n401\n00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.110\nsays, he's gonna be in\ncharge of all the projects.\n\n402\n00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.160\nEssentially, he says,\n\n403\n00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.960\nlook each department needs to actually\ntake someone on their staff and\n\n404\n00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:08.110\nthey are gonna become, let's say, the\nProject Manager for that department, okay?\n\n405\n00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:13.500\nAnd, when he does something like that,\nthat Project Manager here, has the ability\n\n406\n00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:17.410\nto do some of the coordination and\ninfluence that we've talked about before.\n\n407\n00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:22.544\nBut, notice that he's actually a member\nof a particular department and\n\n408\n00:21:22.544 --> 00:21:27.268\nso his particular influence can\nactually extend out to everyone.\n\n409\n00:21:27.268 --> 00:21:31.703\nOr maybe just to the people that he\nneeds on his staff at that point,\n\n410\n00:21:31.703 --> 00:21:34.808\nto be able to work at\nthe stuff that he needs to.\n\n411\n00:21:34.808 --> 00:21:38.730\nFor whatever project that that particular\ndepartment ends up needing here.\n\n412\n00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.577\nAnd so you might have one for\nfinance, marketing, production,\n\n413\n00:21:41.577 --> 00:21:42.888\ncustomer relations as well.\n\n414\n00:21:42.888 --> 00:21:46.343\nYou might have all those individual\nProject Managers instead and\n\n415\n00:21:46.343 --> 00:21:49.688\nthey're actually working\ntogether a little bit more, okay?\n\n416\n00:21:49.688 --> 00:21:54.428\nWhen you start doing stuff like\nthe idea of this balance matrix, okay?\n\n417\n00:21:54.428 --> 00:21:56.796\nNow,when we take a look, then, okay?\n\n418\n00:21:56.796 --> 00:22:00.080\nAt this point, this is where it\nbecomes a little bit more balanced.\n\n419\n00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.770\nThe authority is actually because they\nare actually the project manager for\n\n420\n00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:04.750\nthat team.\n\n421\n00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:10.120\nAnd he's given whatever authority that\nthe department head says he can have.\n\n422\n00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.550\nSo it can be Low to\nModerate at this point.\n\n423\n00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:15.680\nHe doesn't actually have full\ncharge of the entire department but\n\n424\n00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.430\nhe does have some more ability than\nwhat the other two would have too.\n\n425\n00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:24.720\nResource Availability again, is limited\nby who can he get on his team, okay?\n\n426\n00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:29.008\nAnd once again, when you start\nthinking about that, on your team.\n\n427\n00:22:29.008 --> 00:22:32.881\nYou might be able to take away more\nresources and head of department says,\n\n428\n00:22:32.881 --> 00:22:36.198\nokay, that's cool because he's\nworking on a project for me.\n\n429\n00:22:36.198 --> 00:22:39.855\nBut you may end up finding out\nsomething here, that at the same time,\n\n430\n00:22:39.855 --> 00:22:42.458\nyou're not gonna get it from everybody,\nokay?\n\n431\n00:22:42.458 --> 00:22:45.205\nIn this one on the project budget here,\n\n432\n00:22:45.205 --> 00:22:49.708\nit is a mixed type of authority\nas far as the management, right?\n\n433\n00:22:49.708 --> 00:22:54.620\nBecause a project may actually come from\nwhat the entire budget of that department.\n\n434\n00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:58.560\nSo in other words,\nthat now says that the department head,\n\n435\n00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.800\nthe functional manager, comes in and\nsays, all right, here it is.\n\n436\n00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.040\nHere's my entire budget of $500,000, we're\nsetting aside a hundred thousand dollars\n\n437\n00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:09.550\nand that now becomes the authority\nof the project manager.\n\n438\n00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:14.078\nSo it's partial, he still had to actually\nrelate that back, but it is partial.\n\n439\n00:23:14.078 --> 00:23:15.398\nBut at this point though,\n\n440\n00:23:15.398 --> 00:23:18.998\nthe project manager rolled him as\nfull-time within that department.\n\n441\n00:23:18.998 --> 00:23:22.452\nAnd whoever actually gets assigned\nfrom that department probably is gonna\n\n442\n00:23:22.452 --> 00:23:25.098\nbe working full-time for\nthat project manager as well.\n\n443\n00:23:25.098 --> 00:23:26.638\nSo, you do see that.\n\n444\n00:23:26.638 --> 00:23:31.566\nNow, there's two more here and we're\njust gonna kind of go over them cuz you\n\n445\n00:23:31.566 --> 00:23:34.186\ntend to see this a little bit more often.\n\n446\n00:23:34.186 --> 00:23:37.943\nAnd actually, this last one you don't tend\nto see super often unless the company is\n\n447\n00:23:37.943 --> 00:23:39.240\nreally, really gigantic.\n\n448\n00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:44.870\nSo in this one that we call\na strong matrix here, notice,\n\n449\n00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.470\nI just replaced one of these teams here.\n\n450\n00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:50.341\nSo instead of having\nthat customer relation,\n\n451\n00:23:50.341 --> 00:23:53.516\nthere is a Project Management department,\nokay?\n\n452\n00:23:53.516 --> 00:23:58.211\nSo, you can actually have that at Project\nManagement department here in which,\n\n453\n00:23:58.211 --> 00:23:59.738\nwho I do have on the staff?\n\n454\n00:23:59.738 --> 00:24:00.803\nProject Managers,okay?\n\n455\n00:24:00.803 --> 00:24:02.297\nSo that makes sense so\n\n456\n00:24:02.297 --> 00:24:07.540\nnow they have equal authority as all\nthe other functional departments do.\n\n457\n00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:14.310\nAnd now each of these project managers do\nhave the authority because they are equal.\n\n458\n00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:17.160\nTo say they're working for\nthe good of the entire organization and\n\n459\n00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.900\nthey can actually form their own teams.\n\n460\n00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.950\nThey can do just about everything\nthat they need to, okay?\n\n461\n00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.810\nNow this one is as far as\nthe influence goes and\n\n462\n00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.180\nwhat we're looking at\nhere moderate to high.\n\n463\n00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.490\nThey still have to report\nto their department head,\n\n464\n00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:33.960\nthey still have resource availability cuz\nthey have the access to the resource pool,\n\n465\n00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:38.040\nbut now they control their own budget and\nthey're actually full time.\n\n466\n00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.000\nAnd when we move to the projectized,\nokay, and\n\n467\n00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.490\nthat's where we're\nultimately heading here.\n\n468\n00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:48.170\nWhen we take a look now the entire\norganization says what, departments,\n\n469\n00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:49.440\nno way, okay.\n\n470\n00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.897\nWhat we have essentially is that we\nhave multiple project managers and\n\n471\n00:24:52.897 --> 00:24:56.076\nthey function like departments,\nbut they have their own team.\n\n472\n00:24:56.076 --> 00:24:59.185\nThey usually have a set of their own\nresources that they also depend on.\n\n473\n00:24:59.185 --> 00:25:00.820\nThey also share resources.\n\n474\n00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:04.450\nYou name it, everybody has\na project manager, a project team.\n\n475\n00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:06.160\nYou just work on projects.\n\n476\n00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:10.700\nA projectized environment is where\nyou tend to see most things being\n\n477\n00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:15.700\ndone very agilely changing up when they\nneed to, doing some of the things.\n\n478\n00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:19.140\nIt doesn't matter about the reporting\nstructure as far as departments go,\n\n479\n00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:23.240\nit's all about getting your project\nmembers and project teams working.\n\n480\n00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:27.590\nAnd this is where, of course, project\nmanagement becomes a little bit easier.\n\n481\n00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.730\nHigh to total authority,\nresource availability,\n\n482\n00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:33.640\nhigh to total because they're\nall working on the same thing.\n\n483\n00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.190\nYou manage your own budget.\n\n484\n00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:37.660\nAnd, of course, your time is full time.\n\n485\n00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.830\nEverybody that works on your team\nis actually full time as well.\n\n486\n00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:44.080\nIt's prefect, right,\nif you have a shared resource pool,\n\n487\n00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.590\nthen sometimes the administration\nstaff may not be full time.\n\n488\n00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:49.610\nThey may be working for others as well.\n\n489\n00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.712\nBut overall though, when you start\ntaking a look at some of these\n\n490\n00:25:52.712 --> 00:25:56.620\ndifferent organizational structures,\nif you are actually working on a project\n\n491\n00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.684\nmanagement type of team,\nyou've gotta know where you fit in.\n\n492\n00:25:59.684 --> 00:26:02.870\nYou've gotta actually know where\nyour level of influence is.\n\n493\n00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:07.010\nSo take the time to go through,\ndo some reading on each of these.\n\n494\n00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:09.750\nWe kinda went through it in\na fairly fast fashion, here.\n\n495\n00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:13.570\nBut at the same time, it's something\nthat actually opens you up to realize\n\n496\n00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:17.040\nthat if you get hired on as a project\nmanager, what do you need to understand?\n\n497\n00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:20.700\nAre we actually in that functional style?\n\n498\n00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.230\nIs this organization\ncompletely projectized?\n\n499\n00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:24.480\nOr is it somewhere in between?\n\n500\n00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.430\nAnd you work out what's\nyour authority going to be?\n\n501\n00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.320\nWhat control do you have over the budget?\n\n502\n00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.260\nHow do I get my staff members,\nhow do I actually end up working in this?\n\n503\n00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.608\nAnd then, at that point,\nyou choose, you know, whether or\n\n504\n00:26:37.608 --> 00:26:39.926\nnot you're actually going to work for\nthat organization.\n\n505\n00:26:39.926 --> 00:26:44.980\n>> Yeah, projectized actually reminds me\na lot of the special operations command.\n\n506\n00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:48.570\nIn the United States military we have the\nDepartment of Defense and then it goes to\n\n507\n00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.920\nthe Department of the Army, Department\nof the Navy, and so on and so forth.\n\n508\n00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:57.970\nBut SOCOM, the Special Operations Command,\nthey kinda do their own thing,\n\n509\n00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:02.140\nand they even pull resources\nfrom the others, and\n\n510\n00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:06.750\nto create their own teams, but they're not\nunder their jurisdiction should it say.\n\n511\n00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.036\nSo it's very similar in that fashion.\n\n512\n00:27:09.036 --> 00:27:11.650\nI like to projectize because\nthen you get your own team,\n\n513\n00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.420\nyou have your own resources,\nyou don't need\n\n514\n00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:18.180\nto cannibalize somebody else really\nwith their budget or anything like that.\n\n515\n00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:21.170\nEverything is set aside for\nyou to make these projects happen.\n\n516\n00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:24.480\nIt's a whole lot easier and\nit's probably as time goes on,\n\n517\n00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.870\nit's gonna become the more\npopular of the matrices.\n\n518\n00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:29.300\n>> I think you're gonna see that more and\nmore often,\n\n519\n00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:34.140\nbecause we are living in this day and\nage in which the ability to change\n\n520\n00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:38.350\nwhen we need to, right, very quickly,\nis what's gonna be happening.\n\n521\n00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:41.890\nIn that functional type of style\nthat we talked about before.\n\n522\n00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.800\nVery difficult to make a lot\nof changes very quickly.\n\n523\n00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.050\nThey tend to have to all\nbe hierarchical in nature.\n\n524\n00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:51.060\nAnd a lot of times the authority\nalways has to flow from the top\n\n525\n00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.030\ndown before anything can be done.\n\n526\n00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:56.110\nIn a projectized environment, because\neverybody understands that the goal is to\n\n527\n00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:59.820\nget the project done,\nchanges can be made fairly quickly.\n\n528\n00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:01.530\nAnd, with the agreement\nof the project manager,\n\n529\n00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:04.960\nthey know that they can shift the focus\nand even the scope if they need to.\n\n530\n00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.620\nAs long as everything is addressed\nin the way that it needs.\n\n531\n00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:11.000\nSo these are some of those organizational\nstructures that you're likely seeing.\n\n532\n00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.200\nI definitely will tell you\nthat according to CompTIA,\n\n533\n00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.090\nyou're gonna see them on your Project+\nexam, so you wanna make sure that you do\n\n534\n00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:20.970\nunderstand at least the nature and\nthe basics that we talked about here.\n\n535\n00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:24.090\nBut take a little bit more time,\ndo some research and some reading.\n\n536\n00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:29.140\nAgain, we do recommend the actual Sybex\nstudy guide for project plus here and\n\n537\n00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:32.310\nit's actually worth a read for\nyou, a very good definitions and\n\n538\n00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:34.810\nvery good explanations on\neach of this structures here.\n\n539\n00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:39.051\nBut overall though just make\nsure you take a few minutes.\n\n540\n00:28:39.051 --> 00:28:43.325\nAs a brand new project manager, it's\neasier to sit there once somebody says,\n\n541\n00:28:43.325 --> 00:28:47.274\nwe have an opening for project manager,\nand you just apply for the job and\n\n542\n00:28:47.274 --> 00:28:50.094\nyou think that means I have full and\ntotal control.\n\n543\n00:28:50.094 --> 00:28:53.973\nWell you need to have your eyes opened and\nrealize what your bigger role and\n\n544\n00:28:53.973 --> 00:28:57.915\ninfluence is gonna be in that company and\nthat will help you make a better and\n\n545\n00:28:57.915 --> 00:29:01.892\na smarter decision about where your\nskills and capabilities are gonna go.\n\n546\n00:29:01.892 --> 00:29:05.930\n>> All right, well Ronnie thank you so\nmuch for explaining these different\n\n547\n00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:10.210\norganizational structures and how\nthe project manager's gonna fit into that,\n\n548\n00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:13.280\nhow it might work, and\ntypes that you're gonna see in real life.\n\n549\n00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.940\nSo that when you encounter them, well,\nyou understand how they work, and\n\n550\n00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.070\nyou're able to integrate yourself\ninto them as a project manager.\n\n551\n00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:21.830\nThank you so much for that.\n\n552\n00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.970\nIt looks like we have come to the end of\nyet another great episode here at ITProTV.\n\n553\n00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:27.050\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n554\n00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:29.230\nWe always enjoy your viewership.\n\n555\n00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:30.800\nAnd we hope you get a lot\nout of this episode.\n\n556\n00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.110\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n557\n00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:34.290\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n558\n00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:34.990\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n559\n00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:36.607\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n560\n00:29:36.607 --> 00:29:42.318\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

welcome\nto another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.970\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are continuing on with that\n\n5\n00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.250\nProject Plus series we\nhave been working on.\n\n6\n00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.830\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nis none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.200\nRonnie, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.820\n>> Well thank you for\n\n9\n00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.810\nhaving me back, as we continue on taking\na look at Comptia's Project Plus.\n\n10\n00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.600\nToday, we're specifically going to take\na look at a couple of different elements,\n\n11\n00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.020\nbut really focusing in on creating or\npreparing a scope management plan.\n\n12\n00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.160\nSo when we start talking about\nthis idea of preparing this,\n\n13\n00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.970\nwhat we need to make sure that we\nunderstand is that we're not necessarily\n\n14\n00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.150\ngoing to focus in on the scope itself.\n\n15\n00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.940\nBut how we manage the scope\nof the project itself.\n\n16\n00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.570\nAnd this is something\nwe've gotta get used to.\n\n17\n00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.450\nNow if you've already been\nin project management for\n\n18\n00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.910\na while, this is old hat stuff to you,\n\n19\n00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.130\nbut it's a great reminder especially\nif you're preparing for the exam.\n\n20\n00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.670\nBut if your brand new\nto project management,\n\n21\n00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.720\nit's very easy to focus in on the details\nand while we're preparing the scope, and\n\n22\n00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.280\nwe will talk about preparing the scope\nstatement, but overall though,\n\n23\n00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.700\nwe're talking about the plan\nto manage the scope.\n\n24\n00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.450\nNow, you may wonder like I did as we first\nbegan, well what is the real difference?\n\n25\n00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.810\nIf I know what the scope is I should\nbe able to manage the scope itself.\n\n26\n00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.710\nBut that's not always key or clear right\nat the beginning especially if you're\n\n27\n00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.900\na novice at the idea\nof project management.\n\n28\n00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.800\nSo we wanna take a look, then,\n\n29\n00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.030\nas we begin talking about what are the\ncomponents that are involved, and why is\n\n30\n00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.630\nthis idea of planning out scope management\nsomething that is very important to us.\n\n31\n00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.100\nNow Daniel, let me go and\njust ask you a question.\n\n32\n00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.120\nIt's kinda a little bit out of order here.\n\n33\n00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.990\n>> Fire away.\n>> Go ahead and\n\n34\n00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.790\nask you a question,\n>> Daniel, when you've been working for\n\n35\n00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.930\nthat, we're going to say unnamed, but\nlarger organization that you used to work\n\n36\n00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.410\nfor, whenever you heard the term\nsomething they forgot to get in there but\n\n37\n00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.970\nreally needs to be done, what did you\nthink was gonna happen at that point\n\n38\n00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.500\nwith something when you\nheard something like that?\n\n39\n00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.130\n>> I don't know.\n\n40\n00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.370\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n41\n00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.820\n>> Yeah well, every once in a while what\nends up happening is that somebody starts\n\n42\n00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:21.880\na project, right?\n\n43\n00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.420\nAnd then they say,\nyeah that's a great project.\n\n44\n00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.230\nBut you wanna know what else would\nactually be good to throw in there?\n\n45\n00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.110\nWell, things like that actually\nend up happening is that\n\n46\n00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.400\nyou end up hearing phrases like that,\nsomething I forgot to get in there though.\n\n47\n00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.220\n>> The additionals.\n\n48\n00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.000\n>> Yes, the additionals.\n\n49\n00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.840\nThe asides,\n\n50\n00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.260\nyes one more caveat we gotta do this as\nwell, I see where you're going with this.\n\n51\n00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.200\nYeah, that tends to happen actually\nquite often and I actually have\n\n52\n00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.090\na manager who never accounted for that and\nthat's something that we have to do.\n\n53\n00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.540\nYou have to account for the fact that\nthere are going to be things that you\n\n54\n00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.360\neither forget,\ncome about that you couldn't even foresee.\n\n55\n00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.760\nIt's just circumstantial things that\nhappen that you have no ability to go,\n\n56\n00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.840\nwell I should have accounted for\nthat, that are going to come up and\n\n57\n00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.630\nthat starts to cause\na slowdown in our project.\n\n58\n00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.630\nAnd since we have a defined scope,\n\n59\n00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.690\nthat scope is now larger than\nwhat we've defined it as.\n\n60\n00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.600\n>> Yeah and so\nwe'll use this term over and over again.\n\n61\n00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.790\nWhat it normally brings into mind,\nof course for most project managers,\n\n62\n00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.910\nis that term that we've over cliched now,\nscope creep, right?\n\n63\n00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.430\n>> Scope creep.\n\n64\n00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.110\n>> Yeah, the very fact is that when\nwe tend to hear people say that,\n\n65\n00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.670\nusually that means the project\nis probably in danger here and\n\n66\n00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.460\nthe reason why is that\nsomebody is about to say what?\n\n67\n00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.950\nHere's something that should be\na part of this particular project but\n\n68\n00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.190\nreally isn't actually in there.\n\n69\n00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.230\nSo why is that important right now,\nin the steps we're talking about?\n\n70\n00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.090\nThe reason why it's actually important is\nbecause even though we know scope creep\n\n71\n00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.050\ncan happen, and Daniel now actually\nexpects it, he hears the idea of\n\n72\n00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.700\na project like yeah it's going to creep,\nit's going to get bigger.\n\n73\n00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.140\nWe were laughing about this a little\nbit earlier about the idea.\n\n74\n00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.980\nWe're about to move studios and\neven though we\n\n75\n00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.000\nmake a joke of it we kind of understand\nespecially in construction a lot of times,\n\n76\n00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.060\nthings don't happen exactly according\nto what is scheduled to happen.\n\n77\n00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.590\nAnd so we were kinda making jokes like\nwhen is that gonna really happen,\n\n78\n00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.730\nis it gonna happen sooner or\nlater than we think it is?\n\n79\n00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.780\nAnd so it always expands out.\n\n80\n00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.530\n>> Well it's not the fact that it\nexpands that worries us, right?\n\n81\n00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.044\nWe assume it, right?\n\n82\n00:04:22.044 --> 00:04:22.801\n>> We should.\n\n83\n00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:26.805\n>> We kind of just say,\nthe reality is things happen and\n\n84\n00:04:26.805 --> 00:04:29.840\nwe know that it's going to do that.\n\n85\n00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.870\nSo there's a lot of times when we plan for\nthat.\n\n86\n00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.170\nLook, we know we can do it in\nthree weeks but it's better for\n\n87\n00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.190\nus to kind of do it in four.\n\n88\n00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.100\nYou know, make sure.\n\n89\n00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.150\n>> When I took project\nplanning in college,\n\n90\n00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.760\nthey would tell you just take your scope,\nwhatever you think it's gonna take.\n\n91\n00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.440\nTake the longest amount of time that\nit will take from start to finish.\n\n92\n00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.850\nAnd then add half that time to the end,\nand that will account for\n\n93\n00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.380\nyour scope creep.\n\n94\n00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.230\nCuz you're gonna encounter it, and\nthe great thing about this is, and\n\n95\n00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.000\nthis is what I've learned\npractically about scope creep, and\n\n96\n00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.900\na friend of ours used to say,\nunderpromise and overdeliver, right?\n\n97\n00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.810\nIf you account for that scope creep, and\n\n98\n00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.410\nyou say you think it's gonna take you\nsix weeks, so half of that's three,\n\n99\n00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.920\nso tell your project team this\nis gonna take nine weeks to do.\n\n100\n00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.520\nWell if you get it\naccomplished in six weeks,\n\n101\n00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.740\neverything goes perfect,\nyou look like a hero, superhero.\n\n102\n00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.610\nYou're wearing a big red S and\na cape to work every day and\n\n103\n00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.490\nyou're getting pats on the back and you\nare the golden child around that place.\n\n104\n00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.080\nIf you get it done in nine weeks they\nstill think you did a great job.\n\n105\n00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.160\nIsn't that a fantastic thing?\n\n106\n00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.040\nYou gotta account for the scope creep.\n\n107\n00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.060\nBecause if you don't, now if you\nsay I'll get done in six weeks and\n\n108\n00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.660\nthen scope creep happens,\nand it takes you nine?\n\n109\n00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.800\nWell now you look like you're\nincompetent and they're looking for\n\n110\n00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.910\na new project manager.\n\n111\n00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.440\n>> Yeah, it looks like Daniel actually\ntakes the Scotty from Star Trek\n\n112\n00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.780\napproach where you multiply the time\nit takes by a factor of four or\n\n113\n00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.210\nwhatever it is,\nthen you know everything's gonna be done.\n\n114\n00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.900\nNow, when we start talking about that,\nwe can account for\n\n115\n00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.110\nit by doing things like padding\nlike what Daniel's talking about.\n\n116\n00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.650\nBut the reality is this.\n\n117\n00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.300\nWhat we want to do though,\n\n118\n00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.960\nis we wanna actually understand how\nwe manage the scope in this way.\n\n119\n00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.070\nThat if something like scope creep does\nhappen, that we can account for it.\n\n120\n00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.770\nThat we can actually make changes and\nplan for that at some point.\n\n121\n00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.030\nBut if we don't have a plan for it,\nthat is when it really affects us,\n\n122\n00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.950\nis that we don't know how\nto handle that situation.\n\n123\n00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.990\nSo what are some of the ways that\nthis stuff starts inching in\n\n124\n00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.800\nwhen we don't have a plan?\n\n125\n00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.380\nOne is fairly simple,\nit's just like what we've said,\n\n126\n00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.880\nwe can start introducing that we\nare about to do this project plan.\n\n127\n00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.960\nSomebody else pretty much sticks\ntheir head in the door and\n\n128\n00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.790\nsays that sounds like a great plan, but\n\n129\n00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.480\nthis is what else should be included\nin that if you are going to do that.\n\n130\n00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.470\nAnd that happens all the time.\n\n131\n00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.060\nUnsolicited opinion drive\nof what should be in it.\n\n132\n00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.725\nThe other one that begins happen\nof course is now that you do have\n\n133\n00:06:46.725 --> 00:06:49.310\nessentially the project sign off.\n\n134\n00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.900\nThe charter and everything is on hand and\neverybody is ready to go.\n\n135\n00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.770\nYou will also then have people that\nmight be a part of your initial project\n\n136\n00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.350\nteam start talking about your project.\n\n137\n00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.350\nAnd then they end up running into maybe\nwho's the actual ultimate customer for\n\n138\n00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:08.620\nthis project, and that particular customer\nnow begins to, I don't wanna say whisper,\n\n139\n00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.680\nbut begins to talk about hey, what\nshould also be included in here is this.\n\n140\n00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.935\nWell what does everybody on\nthat team want to accomplish.\n\n141\n00:07:16.935 --> 00:07:21.870\nThey want to accomplish the goal of\nbringing to satisfaction that customer.\n\n142\n00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.090\nAnd so instead what you now have is\nsomebody else is on your project team\n\n143\n00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.730\nthat says the only thing I'm really trying\nto do is please the customer and so\n\n144\n00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:34.390\nit's another way that's not\ninsidious in this way, but\n\n145\n00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.220\nit's actually the desire to do what?\n\n146\n00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.980\nTo bring to completion this project by\nhonoring what the customer wants even\n\n147\n00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.106\nthough it may be outside\nthe scope as well.\n\n148\n00:07:42.106 --> 00:07:47.433\nSo the reason why we wanna address that\nis because if we will go ahead and\n\n149\n00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:52.217\nstart saying that we need to have\na plan to manage the scope, and\n\n150\n00:07:52.217 --> 00:07:56.008\nthat's about of course\njust saying what do we do,\n\n151\n00:07:56.008 --> 00:07:59.201\nwhat are the things that we have in place?\n\n152\n00:07:59.201 --> 00:08:01.654\nTo ensure that we will manage the scope or\n\n153\n00:08:01.654 --> 00:08:06.068\nthat we will keep the scope that we're\ngiven or when something happens.\n\n154\n00:08:06.068 --> 00:08:09.048\nWhat are the things that we\ndo to include that process?\n\n155\n00:08:09.048 --> 00:08:12.650\nOr whatever it is that's added in,\nthat cause our scope to create,\n\n156\n00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.308\nhow do we address that as well?\n\n157\n00:08:14.308 --> 00:08:14.908\nOkay?\n\n158\n00:08:14.908 --> 00:08:16.954\nSo that is the whole goal,\n\n159\n00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:21.988\nthe whole reason why we wanna\nplan scope management itself too.\n\n160\n00:08:21.988 --> 00:08:26.177\nSo let's go ahead and talk about some of\nthe different components when we start\n\n161\n00:08:26.177 --> 00:08:29.808\nplanning for scope management and\nwhat should be included in this.\n\n162\n00:08:29.808 --> 00:08:34.553\nI went ahead and created this kind of a\nboard for us, so that we can take a look,\n\n163\n00:08:34.553 --> 00:08:38.508\nlet me see if I can zoom in just\na little bit here, so we can see it.\n\n164\n00:08:38.508 --> 00:08:43.528\nIt's not bad and I'll zoom that\nin just a little bit here for us.\n\n165\n00:08:43.528 --> 00:08:47.506\nAnd take a look, so of course the top\njust says Plan Scope Management here, but\n\n166\n00:08:47.506 --> 00:08:51.268\nwhat when we start taking what is it\nthat we really want to include in here?\n\n167\n00:08:51.268 --> 00:08:56.505\nThe key idea behind planning for this,\nis that we document what it is that we're\n\n168\n00:08:56.505 --> 00:09:01.448\nreally thinking and what we absolutely\ncan do and what we should do, okay?\n\n169\n00:09:01.448 --> 00:09:05.050\nAnd that is the key verb that\nwe're taking a look at here, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.970\nSo take a look here, I just marked\nthese in some bullet points for us.\n\n171\n00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.730\nWe wanna make sure that we document\nthe process used to prepare\n\n172\n00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.070\nthe scope statement.\n\n173\n00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.260\nNow, we haven't actually talked\nabout the scope statement yet.\n\n174\n00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.370\nWe're gonna do that a little bit later on.\n\n175\n00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.890\nBut at this point, we're actually trying\nto make sure that we go ahead and\n\n176\n00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:23.720\ndocument how we came up with a scope.\n\n177\n00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.618\nNow, you might be wondering why\nin the world is that important.\n\n178\n00:09:26.618 --> 00:09:30.866\nIt's important because when people\ntend to add in additional things,\n\n179\n00:09:30.866 --> 00:09:33.358\nthey don't know why you say, no, okay?\n\n180\n00:09:33.358 --> 00:09:34.740\nThey don't, okay.\n\n181\n00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.960\nThey go about,\nwhat I told you is a good idea Daniel, and\n\n182\n00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.180\nnow you have to go well, but\nI already have my scope.\n\n183\n00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.680\nTo them,\nthat's not a justification, right?\n\n184\n00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.540\nThey're saying what?\n\n185\n00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:47.500\nGive me some reasons that you\ndon't wanna add that in there.\n\n186\n00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.930\nWell, by documenting the process that\nyou use to come in with your original\n\n187\n00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:51.850\nscope, right?\n\n188\n00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.550\nYou can say, here it is.\n\n189\n00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.110\nHere's what we talked too.\n\n190\n00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.660\nHere's what the situation\nis at that point.\n\n191\n00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.620\nHere's the problem that\nwe wanted to solve.\n\n192\n00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.210\nHere s all these stuff.\n\n193\n00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:02.668\nAnd I now have documentation.\n\n194\n00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:07.968\nI essentially set it up to now where\nI can say, well, Daniel no, okay?\n\n195\n00:10:07.968 --> 00:10:11.748\nWe're not adding that in, or here's\nthe reason why I don't wanna add it in.\n\n196\n00:10:11.748 --> 00:10:14.763\nAnd now that person that's\nreally trying to angle and\n\n197\n00:10:14.763 --> 00:10:18.520\nget himself to make you add\nwhatever you wanted in there.\n\n198\n00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.400\nYou don't have to worry about it.\n\n199\n00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.980\nYou now have justification and\nyou have solid reason.\n\n200\n00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.109\nAnd now that you've documented it,\nyou can kind of flip to the page and go,\n\n201\n00:10:25.109 --> 00:10:28.488\nhere's why we're not doing that because\nhere's what we actually came up with at\n\n202\n00:10:28.488 --> 00:10:29.398\nthe very beginning.\n\n203\n00:10:29.398 --> 00:10:31.358\nSo that's actually a better argument,\nright?\n\n204\n00:10:31.358 --> 00:10:33.860\nWe were just talking about arguments\nright before the show a little bit.\n\n205\n00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:34.510\nBut that's why.\n\n206\n00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:38.420\n>> Yeah, and that's definitely a good\nreason why to go along those lines.\n\n207\n00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.110\nNow, Ronnie,\nI'm thinking as we're sitting here, and\n\n208\n00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.790\nthis may be playing a little\ndevil's advocate or.\n\n209\n00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.490\n>> Okay.\n>> Just questioning, is it a hard and fast\n\n210\n00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:49.670\nrule we do not, once we got, once we got\nour charter, and here's our boundaries.\n\n211\n00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.038\nWe don't take in any other side or\n\n212\n00:10:52.038 --> 00:10:56.788\nexternal input into that charter\nwhere we're modifying things.\n\n213\n00:10:56.788 --> 00:10:59.268\nDo we ever do that?\n\n214\n00:10:59.268 --> 00:11:03.113\nOr is it such a danger that it'll become a\nnever ending project because we're always\n\n215\n00:11:03.113 --> 00:11:04.560\nadding things on the pile?\n\n216\n00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.240\n>> Well, that's why the planning\nis important, right?\n\n217\n00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:11.760\nThe very fact is, if we don't plan,\nwe will accept everything and\n\n218\n00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.580\nwe will have no justification\nto reject anything, okay?\n\n219\n00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:18.240\nOnce you accept one, then now you have\na second person come along who says,\n\n220\n00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.840\nwell, Daniel you accepted Megan's\nsuggestion, why didn't you accept mine?\n\n221\n00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.480\n>> Foot's in the door.\n\n222\n00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.120\n>> Yeah, foot's in the door, right?\n\n223\n00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.418\nSo there is a danger of that happening,\nokay?\n\n224\n00:11:26.418 --> 00:11:30.118\nBut, if you come up with what\nwe're talking about here, right?\n\n225\n00:11:30.118 --> 00:11:35.443\nA plan to manage the scope itself,\nwhat then you talk about is, well,\n\n226\n00:11:35.443 --> 00:11:41.740\nwe can add in additional things but\nit's gonna require a formalized process.\n\n227\n00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.650\nIn other words, and you can actually see\nit right here on the middle of my slide\n\n228\n00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:49.850\nhere, document the change request process,\ndocuments it.\n\n229\n00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.530\nSo what we're saying look is,\nit's not that we're against changes,\n\n230\n00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.610\nif changes need to be done,\nbut if this is gonna be done,\n\n231\n00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.840\nwe wanna make sure that we\ndocument how it has to happen.\n\n232\n00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.960\nSo that there is no discussion that\nRonnie just made a change because\n\n233\n00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.630\nDaniel's his friend or Daniel slipped him\na 20, whatever it might be, it's not that.\n\n234\n00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.008\n>> Ronnie loves bribery,\nthat's his favorite.\n\n235\n00:12:12.008 --> 00:12:13.248\nThat's the way he gets things done.\n\n236\n00:12:13.248 --> 00:12:15.860\n>> Yeah, but that's why we wanna do this.\n\n237\n00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.240\nSo the idea of coming up\nwith this management plan,\n\n238\n00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.930\nis really a safety net for us, right?\n\n239\n00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.410\nThat we can rely on.\n\n240\n00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:23.888\nNow, do we reject every change outright?\n\n241\n00:12:23.888 --> 00:12:27.333\nWell, that may not actually\nbe a great thing as well,\n\n242\n00:12:27.333 --> 00:12:31.328\nbecause what now if Dan actually\nhears something and he goes.\n\n243\n00:12:31.328 --> 00:12:34.925\nDarn, that's really a good change.\n\n244\n00:12:34.925 --> 00:12:36.425\nWe didn't even consider that,\n\n245\n00:12:36.425 --> 00:12:41.145\nthat's something that we absolutely\nshould consider, and it happens, right?\n\n246\n00:12:42.215 --> 00:12:43.715\nWe're not omniscient.\n\n247\n00:12:43.715 --> 00:12:46.953\nWe don't have this all powerful eye\nthat we can see every possibility.\n\n248\n00:12:46.953 --> 00:12:48.757\nAnd somebody brings that up and you go,\n\n249\n00:12:48.757 --> 00:12:52.213\nman that was something we should have\nconsidered from the very beginning.\n\n250\n00:12:52.213 --> 00:12:56.233\nBut if you don't plan for it, then yes,\nyou have to kinda accept everything and\n\n251\n00:12:56.233 --> 00:12:58.273\nreject everything on a one by one basis.\n\n252\n00:12:58.273 --> 00:13:02.280\nYou can now use the idea of planning\nthis out and actually being able to say,\n\n253\n00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.093\nhere's the process that we're gonna take,\nokay?\n\n254\n00:13:05.093 --> 00:13:07.704\nSo just kinda realize that\nit is about documenting it,\n\n255\n00:13:07.704 --> 00:13:09.193\nmaking sure that it's there.\n\n256\n00:13:09.193 --> 00:13:12.484\nThe other thing that we have to actually\nworry about when talking about planning\n\n257\n00:13:12.484 --> 00:13:13.673\nfor scope management here.\n\n258\n00:13:13.673 --> 00:13:19.920\nIs to understand and begin to take a look\nat this idea of what we call the WBS.\n\n259\n00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:25.380\nNow, we haven't really addressed what\na WBS is a work break down structure.\n\n260\n00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.240\nBut what we're talking about here,\n\n261\n00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.490\nis how do we break down the work\nthat we have accomplished or\n\n262\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.580\nwe planning excuse me that we're\nplanning to accomplish for our project.\n\n263\n00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.730\nNow, you might wonder why is\nthat important in the scope?\n\n264\n00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.288\nWell, if we actually are talking\nabout managing the scope, right?\n\n265\n00:13:41.288 --> 00:13:44.548\nThe entirety of the body\nof work that we need to do.\n\n266\n00:13:44.548 --> 00:13:47.400\nIt means, we need to know what\nthe body of work actually is,\n\n267\n00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.780\nthat we're going to be accomplishing and\ntrying to do here.\n\n268\n00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:55.270\nSo that's why it's actually very important\nfor us because now we can actually say,\n\n269\n00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:56.940\nwell, here's what we have to do.\n\n270\n00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.480\nWhat you're adding in actually requires\n\n271\n00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.010\nmore work than we can\nhandle at this point.\n\n272\n00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:05.040\nOr it might actually say, look,\nthat actually is a great idea, but\n\n273\n00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.810\nit's not actually designed,\n\n274\n00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:11.310\nthat it can be anywhere within my\nparticular work breakdown that I need to.\n\n275\n00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:16.180\nSo you need to actually take some time to\nrealize and see what it is that actually\n\n276\n00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:20.310\nyou put into it to create that work\nbreakdown structure as well, okay?\n\n277\n00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:24.850\nThe other thing of course is to actually\nunderstand how in the world we defined it\n\n278\n00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:28.370\nand verified that this is\nthe scope that we want.\n\n279\n00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:31.230\nOnce again, it goes back to that\nvery first thing is not only are we\n\n280\n00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:35.530\nactually preparing a scope statement but\nwhere in the world we defined it?\n\n281\n00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.510\nAnd how do we verify that\nthis was a great one as well.\n\n282\n00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.510\nAnd so you're adding in background\ninformation is what you're doing.\n\n283\n00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:44.790\nAnd then, of course, how is that scope\ngonna continue to be monitored, so\n\n284\n00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.890\nthat we're not off track and\ncontrolled as well?\n\n285\n00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:52.820\nAnd so we can talk about the idea of\nsetting some type of quality control and\n\n286\n00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.310\nassurance even on our\nscope statement itself.\n\n287\n00:14:56.310 --> 00:15:00.090\nNow we normally don't use those in\nthe planning stage a lot of times\n\n288\n00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:02.320\nas far as quality assurance and control.\n\n289\n00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.510\nBut we can really say that,\nwhat we're gonna do is let's say,\n\n290\n00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:09.440\nevery six weeks we're going to review how\n\n291\n00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.120\nwe know that we're still on track\ninside of the scope itself.\n\n292\n00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.530\nHow do we know that we haven't\nadded in any other thing?\n\n293\n00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.500\nAnd actually take a look at some of\nthe different ways that we can control\n\n294\n00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:19.390\nthat as well.\n\n295\n00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:24.390\nSo throughout the project life cycle\nitself, we may go ahead and do that.\n\n296\n00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:29.220\nBut really the key element, and that's why\nI centered it right here on the screen,\n\n297\n00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.708\nis that if we actually\ndo manage the scope.\n\n298\n00:15:31.708 --> 00:15:36.108\nWe're not actually saying that we reject\nall changes complete carte blanche and\n\n299\n00:15:36.108 --> 00:15:38.188\nsay that changes are not gonna exist.\n\n300\n00:15:38.188 --> 00:15:41.798\nBut what we're saying is,\nif changes need to be done.\n\n301\n00:15:41.798 --> 00:15:45.461\nWe're gonna make sure that we know\nhow to manage those changes and\n\n302\n00:15:45.461 --> 00:15:49.724\nintegrate that into the project and\nthe way that we're gonna be doing it is by\n\n303\n00:15:49.724 --> 00:15:53.476\nformalizing or documenting that\nchange request process, okay?\n\n304\n00:15:53.476 --> 00:15:56.847\nWhen we do so, this is what we're saying\nthis is how we handle scope creep.\n\n305\n00:15:56.847 --> 00:15:59.569\nI mean that is really what\nwe end up saying here.\n\n306\n00:15:59.569 --> 00:16:00.470\nOkay?\n\n307\n00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:01.290\nSo remember that.\n\n308\n00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:04.840\nWe want to make sure that no changes\nget inserted into our project without\n\n309\n00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.020\nour notice.\n\n310\n00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:08.940\nSo that way any time\nsomebody notices that,\n\n311\n00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.420\nthey're either going to\nimplement a change request or\n\n312\n00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.630\nthey're gonna tell whoever it is\nto implement a change request.\n\n313\n00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:17.060\nAnd that will go before\nsome type of review.\n\n314\n00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.510\nAnd they'll actually say whether or not\nthis is a change that we can absorb in and\n\n315\n00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.510\nit can become part of our project or not.\n\n316\n00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:26.900\nWhat we don't want is now Daniel's\nactually the one that's working on just\n\n317\n00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.300\na certain portion of it.\n\n318\n00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.610\nHe says that was a good idea that so\nand so said.\n\n319\n00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.860\nAnd he just starts changing the line,\nokay.\n\n320\n00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.751\nAnd that stuff can happen and\nwe don't think about it, but\n\n321\n00:16:35.751 --> 00:16:37.705\neven the most minute changes, right?\n\n322\n00:16:37.705 --> 00:16:43.450\nCan cause lasting damages, or lasting\nchanges I should say, to your project.\n\n323\n00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.620\nAnd now at the end you pull out whatever\nthat product that you create and\n\n324\n00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.550\ngo, wait a minute, this isn't what\nwe taught that we ordered here.\n\n325\n00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:53.990\nAnd if you haven't seen it,\nthere's a great movie about this Daniel.\n\n326\n00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.945\nyou and I love movies.\n\n327\n00:16:54.945 --> 00:16:56.925\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> One called The Pentagon Wars,\n\n328\n00:16:56.925 --> 00:16:58.350\nif you haven't seen it.\n\n329\n00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:02.150\nAnd it is about the initiation,\nthe initial concept of\n\n330\n00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:05.570\nthe Bradley fighting vehicle and\nhow it turned into a tank.\n\n331\n00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:09.190\nIf you watch that movie, again, I don't\nsuggest you watch it with children,\n\n332\n00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.650\nthere's a lot of profanity in there,\nbut if you watch that\n\n333\n00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.250\nyou actually see the original concept for\nthe Bradley fighting vehicle and\n\n334\n00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:20.440\nthen what it ended up with and\nyou wanna talk about scope creep?\n\n335\n00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.266\nIf you love Project Manager you'll\nactually go how in the world does\n\n336\n00:17:23.266 --> 00:17:23.870\nthis happen?\n\n337\n00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:26.610\nAnd you'll see that it\nstarted off as a blueprint\n\n338\n00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:29.960\nthat got handed up to a department\nwho said, add this in there, and\n\n339\n00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.324\nfinally it ended up at the Pentagon,\nit was a tank.\n\n340\n00:17:32.324 --> 00:17:34.390\nIt was a tank, yeah by far.\n\n341\n00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:38.155\nAnd so it's actually worth a watch if\nyou're interested in learning about scope\n\n342\n00:17:38.155 --> 00:17:41.400\ncreep and\nkind of a funny way at the same time, but\n\n343\n00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.740\na very realistic way about how much\nsomething that could've costed\n\n344\n00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:49.510\na million dollars at the beginning became\nlike a billion dollars in the end.\n\n345\n00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:51.130\nSo it's kind of neat there.\n\n346\n00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.429\nBut remember,\nthe key is knowing how to handle it, okay?\n\n347\n00:17:54.429 --> 00:17:56.640\nWithin the management plan.\n\n348\n00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.579\nIf you have changes that you can't\nmanage and you can't monitor,\n\n349\n00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.010\nit means you can't control it.\n\n350\n00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.278\nOkay, so that's pretty much the key.\n\n351\n00:18:02.278 --> 00:18:05.936\nSo, that's why there's actually dangers\nthat are there whenever you hear somebody\n\n352\n00:18:05.936 --> 00:18:07.370\nsay things like this.\n\n353\n00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.720\nSomething that they should have put in\nhere, something that they forgot to put.\n\n354\n00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.810\nWhen you hear stuff like that,\nthat's fine, okay?\n\n355\n00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:16.090\nYou say well, you know, if that's\nreally essential, let's go ahead and\n\n356\n00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:20.290\ninitiate a change ticket at this point and\nlet's get it run through the process so\n\n357\n00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:24.250\nthat everybody knows what changes\nthat we're talking about as well.\n\n358\n00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.490\nAnd when we do that, right?\n\n359\n00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.590\nThis helps every single person\non the project understand\n\n360\n00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:32.570\nthat a request has been made and\nthat changes actually may happen.\n\n361\n00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:36.341\nBut if it does, we'll come up with\na process to handle that change.\n\n362\n00:18:36.341 --> 00:18:39.615\nSo, initially,\nthat's what we're taking a look at, right?\n\n363\n00:18:39.615 --> 00:18:43.245\nIs that we're documenting\neverything that we can document so\n\n364\n00:18:43.245 --> 00:18:47.799\nthat we know that changes that come in\ncan be handled in a very manageable way.\n\n365\n00:18:47.799 --> 00:18:52.578\nAnd that's what we talk about as\nfar as being included inside of\n\n366\n00:18:52.578 --> 00:18:56.990\nthat realm of what we call\nscope management as well.\n\n367\n00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:00.030\nSo planning that out is actually key.\n\n368\n00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:01.440\nIt's very easy to shoot from the hip and\n\n369\n00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.140\nthink, we'll just handle\nchanges as they come along.\n\n370\n00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.700\nI guarantee you,\nyou'll be able to catch a lot of them, but\n\n371\n00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.600\nit's those changes that slip by you,\nright?\n\n372\n00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.500\nThe ones that you don't even know\nabout that then later on you'll go,\n\n373\n00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.330\nnobody ever said that this was\na change that was going on.\n\n374\n00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.610\nAnd then trying to trace down when that\nchange happened, who made it, you know,\n\n375\n00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:21.580\nwho requested it.\n\n376\n00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:22.650\nWe don't know.\n\n377\n00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.450\nBut that's what you actually want to do is\nbe able to know what goes into this, so\n\n378\n00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:30.930\ncoming up with a plan to manage the scope,\nvery important right at\n\n379\n00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:35.380\nthe beginning when you start talking\nabout planning everything out here, okay?\n\n380\n00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.200\nSo, when you take a look at that,\n\n381\n00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.030\nwell those are the elements\nthat you want to include.\n\n382\n00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:43.760\nNow, let me make sure here,\nI pull up the right thing.\n\n383\n00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.370\nIt's not even the right thing there,\nit's right here, okay?\n\n384\n00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:52.580\nSo, I wanted to show us this\nin light of the PMBOK as well,\n\n385\n00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.210\nand the way that they\nkind of break this down.\n\n386\n00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:58.097\nSo, when we take a look at it\nfrom the PMBOK perspective,\n\n387\n00:19:58.097 --> 00:20:00.804\nnot just necessarily the comp\nT of perspective here,\n\n388\n00:20:00.804 --> 00:20:03.766\nremember that every process\nthat we run through, right?\n\n389\n00:20:03.766 --> 00:20:06.370\nActually goes through,\nwell, elements, okay?\n\n390\n00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:10.620\nWe take a look at what we have as inputs,\nand then the tools, and\n\n391\n00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:15.490\nwhat is the ultimate goal here of\nplanning out scope management, right?\n\n392\n00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:18.690\nSo remember that when we start out here,\nwe can take a look, and\n\n393\n00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.270\nthis is where it's a cyclical process,\nright?\n\n394\n00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:24.990\nThat we know that we're working on\nthe project plan and we know where in\n\n395\n00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:28.280\nthe world planning this scope\nmanagement fits in that project plan.\n\n396\n00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.370\nSo that's an input, is that we know\nthat this is going to be a part of that.\n\n397\n00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:35.292\nWe have the project charter that\nwe've talked about as well, and\n\n398\n00:20:35.292 --> 00:20:39.592\nthen also of course, the environmental\nenterprise factors, right?\n\n399\n00:20:39.592 --> 00:20:43.720\nSo the project charter gives\nus essentially the most high\n\n400\n00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.290\nlevel outline that we have\nthat things need to be done.\n\n401\n00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:51.810\nThe environmental factors that\nwe talked about here, again,\n\n402\n00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:55.250\npersonnel, existing\nelements that's in there,\n\n403\n00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:59.440\nthe organizational culture, you name it,\nthose are also things we have to realize.\n\n404\n00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.920\nAnd then any assets that we have\non hand that will help us out.\n\n405\n00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:08.060\nTemplates, tools, whatever it might be,\nand that will help us to develop that,\n\n406\n00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:09.420\nthat's what we want.\n\n407\n00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.160\nSo we take all of those\ninto consideration and\n\n408\n00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.150\nthe elements that we talked about\nas far as different components and\n\n409\n00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.930\nthen we run through different tools and\ntechniques.\n\n410\n00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:21.890\nHere is pretty much the same process,\ncuz we're not actually doing anything yet\n\n411\n00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:26.510\nas far as using real tools or having\nequipment on hand or anything like that.\n\n412\n00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:31.610\nBut we do, we take some time here, and\nwe say, how are we gonna manage changes,\n\n413\n00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:34.200\nscope creep that may come in?\n\n414\n00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.847\nWhere in the world do we?\n\n415\n00:21:35.847 --> 00:21:37.700\nHow do we break this down?\n\n416\n00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.100\nWhat is it that we need?\n\n417\n00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.970\nAnd that can come from expert\njudgement of us being together,\n\n418\n00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.490\nhaving meetings to determine\nhow do we handle those changes.\n\n419\n00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:46.940\nWho's the best to handle it?\n\n420\n00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.720\nYou name it.\nWe're going to see that, and\n\n421\n00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.630\nthen ultimately two things\nwill actually happen to be\n\n422\n00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:54.510\ncreated from this according to the PMBOK.\n\n423\n00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.920\nWe, of course then, will end up\nwith a scope management plan, okay?\n\n424\n00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.300\nThat is the ultimate goal and result.\n\n425\n00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:04.960\nAnd then you may also end up having\na requirements management plan.\n\n426\n00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.639\nThis is actually for us here, right?\n\n427\n00:22:06.639 --> 00:22:11.290\nThe overall quality type of management\nthat will end up happening as well.\n\n428\n00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:14.650\nSo you can do it from\nthe product side itself and\n\n429\n00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:19.310\nsay here's what this product\nshould actually turn out to be.\n\n430\n00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:22.550\nAnd then you can actually say here\nin the scope management plan, and\n\n431\n00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:26.210\ndo everything else for\nyour overall entire project too.\n\n432\n00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:28.990\nAll right, so, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at this scope management plan.\n\n433\n00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:32.180\nI have a template that I've\ncreated a while ago so\n\n434\n00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.340\nthat we can take a look at this.\n\n435\n00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:35.480\nI just wasn't able to find it very easily.\n\n436\n00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.530\nSo notice here it is,\na scope management plan for us, and\n\n437\n00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.820\nlet me see if I can do this as a single\npage instead of dual page here.\n\n438\n00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:48.820\nOne page, that's a little bit better,\n\n439\n00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.920\nwe can actually at least see it at this\npoint, it's really weird to do this.\n\n440\n00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.160\nSo using a template is something that\ncan help you out especially if you're\n\n441\n00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.330\nworking on this.\n\n442\n00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:59.480\nAnd if you're doing this in a meeting type\nenvironment you just give everybody one\n\n443\n00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.180\nof these and then y'all kind of\nwork it out together, right?\n\n444\n00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.320\nSo we want to talk about\nthe scope development statement.\n\n445\n00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.370\nRemember that this is where we actually\ntalk about the background of what\n\n446\n00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:08.810\nwe have in place here.\n\n447\n00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.920\nMaking sure that we do have\nall of the information\n\n448\n00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.390\nthat shows the planning that\nwent in to that scope statement.\n\n449\n00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.760\nWe also of course talked about\nthat work breakdown structure.\n\n450\n00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:22.080\nIn other words did we already\ndo the breakdown work so\n\n451\n00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.490\nthat we know what work is\nactually accomplished here?\n\n452\n00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.970\nYou wanna make sure that you\nactually do have that in place.\n\n453\n00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:33.390\nA dictionary is really kind of key because\neven with multiple project teams, right?\n\n454\n00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:36.210\nWe need to define a common set of terms.\n\n455\n00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:41.084\nAs people move in from one particular area\nversus another one, and they're working on\n\n456\n00:23:41.084 --> 00:23:45.507\nthe team, we need to make sure that what\nwe mean when we refer to a work package.\n\n457\n00:23:45.507 --> 00:23:52.098\nWhen we refer to, you know, a process,\nor a process group, whatever might be.\n\n458\n00:23:52.098 --> 00:23:56.040\nYou want to make sure you define those\nterms here in the scope as well, okay?\n\n459\n00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:01.690\nAlso of course baseline maintenance too,\nso this is us checking back in.\n\n460\n00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:08.730\nWhere are we comparing the forward\nprogress of our project too.\n\n461\n00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:14.280\nAnd then, how do we handle scope\nchanges which is by far at least,\n\n462\n00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.990\nwhen I think about it, cuz this is really\nthe thing that we're really trying to\n\n463\n00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:20.990\nmanage, right,\nis how do we handle the scope changes too?\n\n464\n00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:24.500\nAnd of course, Deliverable Acceptance,\nwhat are those common elements there at\n\n465\n00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.730\nthe end, that actually say that\nwe've done what we needed to.\n\n466\n00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:31.100\nAnd then, integration requirements,\nof course that we have.\n\n467\n00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:36.370\nSo, normally this is a very generic\ntype of plan that you might have.\n\n468\n00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:40.630\nNow, remember that I've emphasized\nthis point before in our series here.\n\n469\n00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:42.880\nThe very fact is you\ndon't have to use this,\n\n470\n00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.130\nyou don't even have to include\nevery single element in here, okay?\n\n471\n00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.150\nSo this is one of the most generic\nones that I had available, but\n\n472\n00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:53.530\nin your industry and whatever\nfocus that you're having to do you\n\n473\n00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:56.610\nsimply remove the elements\nyou don't need to use and\n\n474\n00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:00.170\nthey add the elements back in that\nyou want to actually be able to use.\n\n475\n00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:03.810\nAnd what would generally help you be\nable to come up with some type of plan.\n\n476\n00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:07.450\nNow the plan itself, right, it doesn't\nhave to limit itself to two pages.\n\n477\n00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:10.570\nI didn't wanna write out anything, that's\nwhy mine's limited to two pages, here.\n\n478\n00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:14.910\nBut essentially you're just gonna add in\nthe text that you need to and in the end\n\n479\n00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:20.400\neverything should actually be approved as\nfar as the actual management plan itself.\n\n480\n00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.840\nSo, you do have to take\na little bit of time\n\n481\n00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.240\nwhen you start taking a look there\nat actually building it up, okay?\n\n482\n00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:34.270\nSo, we also wanna take a look then at\njust a couple of other factors as well.\n\n483\n00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:38.020\nSo, that's an example of using some of\nthose organizational assets that you\n\n484\n00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.400\nmight have on hand.\n\n485\n00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.350\nThe other part then is how\ndo we put it together.\n\n486\n00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:47.330\nNow, I showed you that generic\nthree steps, inputs, tools and\n\n487\n00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:50.460\ntechniques and then of course\nthe ultimate output here, but\n\n488\n00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.470\nwhat what do you have to actually\nconsider then in terms of your input?\n\n489\n00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:57.587\nWell, when it comes down to it for\nthe scope management plan itself,\n\n490\n00:25:57.587 --> 00:26:00.832\nwe're actually just gonna review\njust a couple of things here, okay?\n\n491\n00:26:00.832 --> 00:26:05.719\nOne, take a look at the stability\nof the scope itself, okay?\n\n492\n00:26:05.719 --> 00:26:09.249\nIs the scope that you have\nactually something that you go,\n\n493\n00:26:09.249 --> 00:26:12.540\nthis shouldn't need a lot of changes,\nright?\n\n494\n00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:16.050\nThe very fact is your stakeholders, when\nthey come together, they should go, no,\n\n495\n00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:17.590\nthis is pretty good.\n\n496\n00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:22.220\nIf they not sure, then yes, you have\nto worry about it a little bit more.\n\n497\n00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:26.850\nIs that this point before you set anything\nin stone, any lingering issues right?\n\n498\n00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:30.430\nThat you’re having found the initiation\nstage the project stage.\n\n499\n00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:31.660\nGo ahead and try and\n\n500\n00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:37.680\nresolve that now before you really define\nwhat that scope statement is going to be.\n\n501\n00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.210\nSo you make sure you ask you take that in\nthe consideration, you also wanna make\n\n502\n00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:49.560\nsure you understand that on your\nproject if it's really limited by time,\n\n503\n00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:54.110\nyou've gotta understand what impact\nthat that scope is gonna change.\n\n504\n00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:57.620\nOr if you actually have a limited amount\nof money or you have to produce so\n\n505\n00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:58.730\nmany of these things.\n\n506\n00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:03.360\nOr whatever it might be, you have\nto understand what impacts any time\n\n507\n00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.810\nsomething in the overall scope changes.\n\n508\n00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:08.330\nAnd are you willing to\nlive with that as well?\n\n509\n00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:12.740\nSo that means you at this point here,\nhave to consider all of the constraints\n\n510\n00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:17.100\nthat you have to be able to\ndeal with from your project.\n\n511\n00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.340\nAre there actually additional\nresources that will be available\n\n512\n00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.820\nif you continue to add work?\n\n513\n00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.030\nYou might find out something, no, okay.\n\n514\n00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:27.380\nHere it is, here's the limitation\nof your team, and that's it.\n\n515\n00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:30.400\nNo matter what somebody else comes in,\nyou can say, look there's just not enough\n\n516\n00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:34.470\nmanpower to get done the additional\nthings that we need to.\n\n517\n00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:37.560\nAnd, of course, if there actually\nis additional money involved,\n\n518\n00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.910\nwhich there always is gonna be,\nyou continue to allow a scope to creep,\n\n519\n00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:43.170\nit's gonna absolutely cost you more money.\n\n520\n00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:46.580\nSo how do you actually secure\nadditional funding for it or\n\n521\n00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:50.330\nare you expecting people to give you\ngratis to be able to do all this,\n\n522\n00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:52.680\nin other words, work for\nfree for a bit of time.\n\n523\n00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.460\nSo, you'll probably also see that as well,\nokay?\n\n524\n00:27:55.460 --> 00:28:01.846\nNow, we do have a little bit more to\ncover here, and even actually right here.\n\n525\n00:28:01.846 --> 00:28:05.340\nI was trying to make sure I was saying\nthe right thing here, but here it is.\n\n526\n00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.440\nThis scope change process, I don't know\nwhy I wasn't seeing that right here on my\n\n527\n00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.640\nscreen, it's probably cuz I\ndon't have my glasses on.\n\n528\n00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.590\nBut remember that what we want right\nhere right as far as the input,\n\n529\n00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:16.460\nis that we wanna know, okay.\n\n530\n00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:21.500\nWe want as much as we can as\nan input that we have some process\n\n531\n00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.690\nthat handles changes, okay.\n\n532\n00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:26.420\nWe don't wanna go into this blindly and\ngo,\n\n533\n00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.780\nall right guys, let's figure out\nhow we're gonna handle changes.\n\n534\n00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:33.550\nTake some structure in mind, whether it's\nyour organizational asset that says,\n\n535\n00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:37.590\nhere's how we manage changes formally,\nokay, whether it's a template that\n\n536\n00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:41.930\nyou follow, whatever it is, you want to\nmake sure that you have some process.\n\n537\n00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:45.760\nAnd here the recommendation from\nCompTIA is at least that's right.\n\n538\n00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:50.390\nAt a minimum, make somebody fill out\na change request form, just at a minimum.\n\n539\n00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:53.970\nIt doesn't mean you have to follow\neverything, but that way you have at least\n\n540\n00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:59.370\na document that says, Daniel requested\nthis change and that way, we can do that.\n\n541\n00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:02.120\nSo we described a change, reason for it,\n\n542\n00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:07.420\nwhoever originated it and also is there a\nconsequence if the change doesn't happen?\n\n543\n00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.570\nDaniel might have actually put\nthat at the very end like,\n\n544\n00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:13.700\nthis change better be in here or\nI'm withdrawing my funding from this.\n\n545\n00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.350\nAnd even if the change didn't\nget in there and they say,\n\n546\n00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:17.830\nwell why did the project fail?\n\n547\n00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:20.750\nSomebody can do a thumb back through and\ngo, here's why it didn't fail.\n\n548\n00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:24.160\nDaniel said he wouldn't sign off on\nanything else as far as money goes\n\n549\n00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.700\nif he didn't have this\nchange request in there.\n\n550\n00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:26.710\n>> Creates a paper trail.\n\n551\n00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:28.180\n>> It does create a paper trail.\n\n552\n00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.090\nYep, it surely does.\n\n553\n00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:30.650\nDon't forget,\n\n554\n00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:35.350\nyou wanna make sure you also impact the\nscope change quality that we also have.\n\n555\n00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:40.820\nAnd at the end of this, right, that there\nis a formal place that says whether or not\n\n556\n00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:47.350\nthe change was accepted or rejected, that\nneeds to be in very clear writing, okay?\n\n557\n00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:50.960\nNot somebody just scribbled a name on it,\nright?\n\n558\n00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.970\nIn other words, it literally has\ncheck boxes or something that says,\n\n559\n00:29:55.970 --> 00:30:01.360\nchange approved, change denied,\nchange rejected, whatever it is,\n\n560\n00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.640\nand then names actually right after that,\nthat it was actually rejected here.\n\n561\n00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.730\nSo there's no vaguery to it, right?\n\n562\n00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:12.820\nThe very fact is that Daniel gets this\nback and it has a signature on it.\n\n563\n00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.840\nWell does that signature mean\nthat it was accepted or rejected?\n\n564\n00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.850\nWe don't have a clue.\n\n565\n00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:19.370\nWhat does that signature really mean?\n\n566\n00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:23.140\nWell, we might find out later on that it\nmeans that if somebody initialed here,\n\n567\n00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:27.600\nit means the formal project team\ndid get the actual request.\n\n568\n00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:28.930\nDoes it mean they did anything with it?\n\n569\n00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:29.880\nNo.\n\n570\n00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:33.180\nWell, somebody signed it, but that doesn't\nmean that they did anything with it.\n\n571\n00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:39.330\nSo you want to make sure that there is\nactually very much a right in front,\n\n572\n00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:40.770\napproved or rejected.\n\n573\n00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:44.170\nThis is where the big red\nstamps really do help, right?\n\n574\n00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:46.490\nApproved, rejected whatever it might be.\n\n575\n00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:50.170\nMake sure it's there, make sure it’s\nsigned, and we are ready to go.\n\n576\n00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:53.330\nAlso, of course, make sure that your\nstakeholders understand that if a change\n\n577\n00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:58.800\ndoes happen, that we do communicate\nthose changes if they do happen.\n\n578\n00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.340\nAnd then, of course,\nthat we have a solid methodology for\n\n579\n00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:05.690\nthe changes that actually have now\ncome into existence for us, so\n\n580\n00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:10.880\nthe scope or the actual management\nplan for that really does come into\n\n581\n00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:15.990\nplay when we start talking about planning\nfor that scope management here, right.\n\n582\n00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:19.020\nSo all that's actually a part\nof bringing that together and\n\n583\n00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.880\nunderstanding that there is gonna\nbe planning that needs to happen.\n\n584\n00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:25.290\nSo it doesn't mean that we're\nfinished with everything yet but\n\n585\n00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:28.210\nthere's still a couple of other\nthings that we need to talk about.\n\n586\n00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:30.450\nBut Daniel,\nyou've let me talk a long time again,\n\n587\n00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.450\nit looks like I've run\nout of time [LAUGH].\n\n588\n00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:35.680\n>> I just love to hear you wax eloquent,\nso I mean, who doesn't, right?\n\n589\n00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.170\nIt's good stuff.\n\n590\n00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:40.060\nWe wanna hear this stuff, and obviously\nthere's more to it, so we obviously,\n\n591\n00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.643\nwe got another part two in our future, but\nwe love part two's who doesn't, right?\n\n592\n00:31:43.643 --> 00:31:44.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They're great stuff.\n\n593\n00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:46.190\nRonnie, thank you for joining us today.\n\n594\n00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:48.210\nThank you for walking us through\nwhat we've gotten through so far.\n\n595\n00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:50.630\nLooking forward to see you\nthere in that part two.\n\n596\n00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:52.750\nLooking forward to see you\nall out there as well.\n\n597\n00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.040\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off though for ITPro TV.\n\n598\n00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.810\nBeen your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n599\n00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:57.650\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n600\n00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:59.154\n>> See ya next time.\n\n601\n00:31:59.154 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.307 --> 00:00:19.369\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.135\nwell we are continuing on\nwith our Project+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:25.730\nIt is another one of our famous\npart twos coming at you.\n\n6\n00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.650\nJoining us today in the studio, yet again,\nis none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.880\nRonnie, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.750\n>> Well, thank you for having me as we\ncontinue on to take a look at the idea of\n\n9\n00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.390\nplanning the scope\nmanagement statement here.\n\n10\n00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.400\nAnd what we wanna do,\n\n11\n00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.510\nis we wanna actually take a look here at\nsome of the things we didn't finish up.\n\n12\n00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.450\nAs we were actually talking\nabout this idea of planning.\n\n13\n00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.870\nNow this is where that\nstrange question comes in to\n\n14\n00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.090\nthe reality of project management.\n\n15\n00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.240\nWhat comes first, the chicken or the egg?\n\n16\n00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.230\nAnd you might wonder what\nare you talking about Ryan?\n\n17\n00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.740\nWell a lot of times when we talk\nabout that idea of planning\n\n18\n00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.760\nfor scope management, I can't say it.\n\n19\n00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.603\n>> Third time's the charm.\n\n20\n00:01:06.603 --> 00:01:07.540\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah I know, and\n\n21\n00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.090\nalso being able to make sure that\nwe create a scope statement,\n\n22\n00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.390\nwell you might think well the way\nthat we would actually do that right,\n\n23\n00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.310\nis that we would create\nthe scope statement first and\n\n24\n00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.730\nthen we would begin planning for\nthe actual scope management.\n\n25\n00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.210\nLogically that really is\nhow my brain would work.\n\n26\n00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.770\nIs it that you would have to do that.\n\n27\n00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.380\nBut Ronnie, you're presenting it and\nthe backward order.\n\n28\n00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.380\nAnd why on the world would you that?\n\n29\n00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.597\nWell, the reason why we're actually doing\nthat because the way that you have to\n\n30\n00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:40.390\nthink about it right is from\nmanagement perspective.\n\n31\n00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.300\nNow, in this sense.\n\n32\n00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.590\nYou can actually manage the entire scope\n\n33\n00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.240\nwithout you knowing about any\nof the details of the scope.\n\n34\n00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.250\nBecause, what did we really focus in on\nin the previous episode here, in our part\n\n35\n00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.500\none, is that we talked about that it's not\nabout what the scope actually is, right?\n\n36\n00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.500\nIt's about how we manage that scope,\nhow are we actually accounting for\n\n37\n00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.260\nchanges that can creep in and for being\nable to accept, and being able to monitor,\n\n38\n00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.000\nbeing able to know that changes\nare coming into the plan.\n\n39\n00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.940\nWell we can actually manage all\nof that without actually knowing\n\n40\n00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.730\nwhat the details of the scope is.\n\n41\n00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.780\nWe can set that up and say here is how\nwe are going to deal with changes.\n\n42\n00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.480\nWe can set it up to say here's\nhow we actually need to make sure\n\n43\n00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.600\nthat we get everybody to follow\nalong with these procedures\n\n44\n00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.000\nwithout actually having the scope in hand.\n\n45\n00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.780\nSo in that sense being able to create\na management plan without actually knowing\n\n46\n00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.620\nthe scope it can be done.\n\n47\n00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.465\nNow is it easier though?\n\n48\n00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:34.590\nOkay.\nIf you do have\n\n49\n00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.210\nthe actually scope statement in hand,\nyou better believe it right?\n\n50\n00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.940\nBecause then you can tailor that scope\nmanagement plan without guessing,\n\n51\n00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.430\nwithout trying to use some generic and\nhigh level overview.\n\n52\n00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.062\nAnd then you can really customize and\n\n53\n00:02:49.062 --> 00:02:53.970\ndetail your scope management plan, but\nthat means we have to go back then.\n\n54\n00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.030\nWe need to take a look at\nthe components that really do make up\n\n55\n00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.240\nthe idea of the scope statement itself and\nknow what's actually in it, and\n\n56\n00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.980\nthen we're going to take a little bit of a\nreview to actually talk about how we come\n\n57\n00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.360\nup with this too, and that will help us\nto fill out the actual gap that we have.\n\n58\n00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.040\nAnd lastly, we'll also talk about\nvalidating scope with different\n\n59\n00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.530\nstakeholders and what we need to\nactually keep in mind there as well.\n\n60\n00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.820\nSo it's a fairly full episode for\nus as we continue on, but\n\n61\n00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.190\nit's something that we\ndefinitely need to look at.\n\n62\n00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.610\nSo don't always think about this in\nterms of all those details, right.\n\n63\n00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.900\nEverything in project management is\nabout managing what actually happens,\n\n64\n00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.900\nnot about what actually happens.\n\n65\n00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.404\nAnd that's a hard thing for us and\n\n66\n00:03:35.404 --> 00:03:39.300\nwe're just beginning our career in\nproject management to understand.\n\n67\n00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.814\nRemember that a lot of time if you come up\nworking up through the functional levels\n\n68\n00:03:42.814 --> 00:03:47.310\nand they now make you a project manager,\nyou do have the perspective of working at\n\n69\n00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.570\nall of those details and\nplans that you're used to working at.\n\n70\n00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.860\nAnd it is frustrating at times when\nyou don't see people able to do\n\n71\n00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.420\nwhat you're able to do.\n\n72\n00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.470\nBut now as a manager, right,\nyou need to take a step back and\n\n73\n00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.290\nactually try and\nfigure out how to effectively manage\n\n74\n00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.720\nkind of the details here without actually\ngetting too involved in any one detail.\n\n75\n00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.370\nBecause once you do that, once you get\ntoo involved, that means your eye is off\n\n76\n00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.960\nthe ball for the entire project and\nthat's gonna hurt you.\n\n77\n00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.480\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look here,\n\n78\n00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.470\nwhen we start taking a looking at the\nscope statement, and see if we can tell\n\n79\n00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.230\nthe difference between the management and\nalso what the statement itself does, okay.\n\n80\n00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.676\nSo before, when we talked about the scope\nmanagement plan, right, we really said,\n\n81\n00:04:28.676 --> 00:04:31.823\nhey, what are the things in place\nthat we can put there okay,\n\n82\n00:04:31.823 --> 00:04:33.775\nto ensure that we keep in that scope?\n\n83\n00:04:33.775 --> 00:04:37.597\nBut now when you take a look\nat the scope statement, right,\n\n84\n00:04:37.597 --> 00:04:41.510\nwe now talk about very detailed\nobjectives as much as we can.\n\n85\n00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.179\nNow, we're not looking to nitpick on\nevery single work package, but what we're\n\n86\n00:04:46.179 --> 00:04:50.800\nsaying is we wanna make sure that we\nunderstand the details of the scope.\n\n87\n00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.470\nAnd that means we're actually\ntaking a look at things like\n\n88\n00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.720\ndo we have on hand what is gonna be\nthe project's acceptance criteria?\n\n89\n00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.600\nSo what is gonna be that standard?\n\n90\n00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.550\nWhat is actually gonna be\nthat goal that we have?\n\n91\n00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.760\nThat we'll actually say that we've\ncreated something acceptable\n\n92\n00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.612\nthat we wanna make sure\nthat we have even out?\n\n93\n00:05:08.612 --> 00:05:10.490\nYou might say, well how do we know that?\n\n94\n00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.830\nWe haven't even begun the idea of managing\na project and even seeing a project yet.\n\n95\n00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.660\nWell that's the key right?\n\n96\n00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.960\nIt's that you're keeping your eye on\nthe overall goal itself and you know what\n\n97\n00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.090\nthe final product is gonna look like, or\nthe final service or the actual result.\n\n98\n00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.990\nWhat is it that you're really hoping for\nand that you have the details to be able\n\n99\n00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.330\nto know how is that actually gonna\nbe accepted at this point, okay?\n\n100\n00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.910\nSo, you do want to make sure\nthat you understand that that's\n\n101\n00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.410\nhow detailed we're talking about.\n\n102\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.050\nRight.\n\n103\n00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.400\nSo, it doesn't have to actually\nmatter in every little detail.\n\n104\n00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.850\nBut, how do you know what the final\nthing is gonna look like?\n\n105\n00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.320\nYou got to make sure you have that\neven now in your scope statement.\n\n106\n00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.620\nBecause, that's how you\ncan compare whether or\n\n107\n00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.460\nnot something belongs in the scope or\nsomething that doesn't.\n\n108\n00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.800\nRight.\n\n109\n00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.530\nSecondly, we can also talk about the idea\nhere of making sure that we document\n\n110\n00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.300\nthe deliverables and\nthe objectives as well.\n\n111\n00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.135\nSo this is all about writing it down.\n\n112\n00:06:04.135 --> 00:06:07.310\nLike how do we know that we've not\nonly achieved what we have here, but\n\n113\n00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.640\nthat we document what we're\nto produce from this as well?\n\n114\n00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.360\nSo it might be one overall objective\nas far as the acceptance criteria goes.\n\n115\n00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.576\nBut what is the actual\noverall deliverables?\n\n116\n00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:20.320\nWe might find that there's actually\nother things that were created, and\n\n117\n00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.740\nthe objectives, and\nthey need to be in writing and\n\n118\n00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.070\nthat's what the scope\nstatement helps us to do.\n\n119\n00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.650\nAnd the scope statement\nshould help to clarify\n\n120\n00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.160\nas the project begins to move forward\nhere, any understanding, okay, and\n\n121\n00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.300\nevery understanding of what is to be\naccomplished through the entire project.\n\n122\n00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.040\nAnd also, of course,\nwhat is not to be accomplished.\n\n123\n00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.670\nSo that is also a key statement for us\nwhen we talk about detailed objectives and\n\n124\n00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.560\nwhat we have to have in here.\n\n125\n00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.750\nWe need to have a very clear delineation.\n\n126\n00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.480\nHere's what the project brings us.\n\n127\n00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.945\nHere's what the project doesn't bring us.\n\n128\n00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:57.190\nIf not a very kind of a vague line,\n\n129\n00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.490\na very foggy area will\nactually be brought up.\n\n130\n00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:07.290\nIt says, well, this kinda meets what your\nscope statement says, but not fully.\n\n131\n00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.250\nSo is that okay that I only meet 75% here?\n\n132\n00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.540\nYou wanna make sure that\nit's actually clearly there,\n\n133\n00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.580\nwhat we are gonna accomplish and\nwhat will not be considered a part of it.\n\n134\n00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.270\nAnd lastly of course,\n\n135\n00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.595\nthe scope statement should help everybody\nworking on the overall project itself,\n\n136\n00:07:22.595 --> 00:07:27.380\nokay, to insure that the work is\ncompleted that's actually agreed to.\n\n137\n00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.460\nEverything actually happens here.\n\n138\n00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:34.880\nSo this statement is a very key part of\nhow the project plan is going to develop.\n\n139\n00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.630\nAnd it's actually a key part of that.\n\n140\n00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.748\nAnd it actually helps us to just\nessentially define how our project is\n\n141\n00:07:40.748 --> 00:07:42.312\nreally gonna be limited.\n\n142\n00:07:42.312 --> 00:07:43.949\nAnd focused on hitting the goal.\n\n143\n00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:44.575\n>> Yeah Ronnie.\n\n144\n00:07:44.575 --> 00:07:49.523\nSo what I'm hearing you say is if\nour project is to make a five by\n\n145\n00:07:49.523 --> 00:07:53.725\nfive pine box,\nthen that's in my scope statement.\n\n146\n00:07:53.725 --> 00:07:57.573\nIf I come to you with a four by\nfour metal box You're able to go,\n\n147\n00:07:57.573 --> 00:07:59.284\nthat is absolutely wrong.\n\n148\n00:07:59.284 --> 00:08:02.580\nYou did make a box but it's not\nthe box that we put into the project.\n\n149\n00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.200\nIt was supposed to be made of wood,\nspecifically pine and\n\n150\n00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.960\nthe dimensions were supposed to be\nfive by five, not four by four.\n\n151\n00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.780\nSo that scope statement helps you\nkeep that with those definitions,\n\n152\n00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.730\nthat well defined set of criteria so\nwhen I have a finished product,\n\n153\n00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.840\nI can go that is the finished product.\n\n154\n00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.790\n>> Yeah, and that is really some of the\nthings that we have to keep in mind and\n\n155\n00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.210\nif not, that's where that scope creep,\nagain, that we talked about comes in.\n\n156\n00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.785\nSo having a clear definition of\nit is great, because now then,\n\n157\n00:08:29.785 --> 00:08:32.348\nyou can take that project\nmanagement plan and\n\n158\n00:08:32.348 --> 00:08:35.666\ndetail them that way to ensure\nthat things don't happen.\n\n159\n00:08:35.666 --> 00:08:42.200\nNow, how do we know that we are actually\neven keeping within that scope itself?\n\n160\n00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.600\nWell, along the way at you\nstart developing this,\n\n161\n00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.080\nyour scope statement actually helps you,\n\n162\n00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:52.260\nnot only by defining what those actual\ndimensions are and those components are.\n\n163\n00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.570\nBut how do you know that your\nproject is gonna help out here?\n\n164\n00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.870\nAnd what you're looking for then is\nthat in your project along the way,\n\n165\n00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.670\nokay, how do you know you're\ngonna meet the scope?\n\n166\n00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.480\nWell the way that you know that is that\nthere are certain technical things that we\n\n167\n00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.870\npoint out which we call the idea\nof key performance indicators.\n\n168\n00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:16.100\nOr KPIs that we actually do end up\nputting within our project here.\n\n169\n00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.580\nNow, I marked it here with\na couple of asterisks\n\n170\n00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.380\nbecause I think you're going to see\nthat term again as you get ready.\n\n171\n00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.830\nWell, let me put it this way, you should\nemphasize this as you're preparing for\n\n172\n00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:33.035\nyour CompTIA or Project+ exam,\nI was about to say the PNP but.\n\n173\n00:09:33.035 --> 00:09:34.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'd be wrong there.\n\n174\n00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.660\nSo as you're preparing for this, they\ntalk about key performance indicators.\n\n175\n00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.880\nNow, you might say why is\nthis within the scope.\n\n176\n00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:45.070\nBecause, that is actually what lets you\nknow that you, as you do this project,\n\n177\n00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.920\nthat this is what should be in place, and\n\n178\n00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.010\nthat way you know you're\ngonna keep the scope.\n\n179\n00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.180\nSo it begins with things like\nwhat we call milestones.\n\n180\n00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.580\nNow what the heck is a milestone?\n\n181\n00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.370\nWell, we're gonna get\na little bit deeper in that.\n\n182\n00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:55.240\nBut think about this.\n\n183\n00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.570\nIt's a milestone.\n\n184\n00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:59.770\nIt actually is we can actually put some\n\n185\n00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.740\nplace in the schedule that says this is\nwhere we should be during our schedule.\n\n186\n00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:08.230\nAnd so they can actually compare your\nperformance where you said that you're\n\n187\n00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:12.350\nsupposed to be in this schedule\nversus where you really are and so\n\n188\n00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:17.465\nif you have milestones that actually shows\nthat you know, hey, here is the actual\n\n189\n00:10:17.465 --> 00:10:22.950\noverall scope that we have in hand and\nthis is where we should be.\n\n190\n00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.440\nSame thing with deliverables,\n\n191\n00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.190\nkeeping schedules,\nthese are all what we call KPIs.\n\n192\n00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:31.540\nI'm gonna say KVIs here,\nthat actually show that we're on track.\n\n193\n00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:36.180\nAnd that's pretty much the key idea here\nis that you might see things like this.\n\n194\n00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.920\nSo as you're developing that project plan,\nas you continue on and\n\n195\n00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.700\ndevelop the scope here, you should be able\nto mark what those KPIs are gonna be.\n\n196\n00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.610\nAlso, remember that these are gonna\nbe monitored along the actual project\n\n197\n00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:50.850\nschedule as well, okay?\n\n198\n00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.990\nAnd if we're not meeting those\nkey performance indicators,\n\n199\n00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.640\nthat should be a hint that we\nneed to resteer the project and\n\n200\n00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.270\nhave some method to get it\nback on schedule, all right?\n\n201\n00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.490\nSo, we can't just have a scope statement,\nlike what Daniel said, and\n\n202\n00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.340\nsay, here is the box.\n\n203\n00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.970\nAnd then, along the way,\nI go, well, Daniel,\n\n204\n00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.920\nhow far along are you\nprogressing on the box?\n\n205\n00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.470\nAnd Daniel just looks at me and\ngoes, you'll get it, when you get it.\n\n206\n00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:14.640\nThat's it.\n>> That's how I go down.\n\n207\n00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.870\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's just what I do.\n\n208\n00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:16.732\n>> And that's sounds great-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n209\n00:11:16.732 --> 00:11:17.738\n>> Until I say, well, Daniel,\n\n210\n00:11:17.738 --> 00:11:20.086\nyou're suppose to produce 1,000\nof them by the end of the week.\n\n211\n00:11:20.086 --> 00:11:23.646\nAnd now, Daniel's going,\nthis is number three.\n\n212\n00:11:23.646 --> 00:11:25.866\nWell now, then all of a sudden\nwe kinda realize something.\n\n213\n00:11:25.866 --> 00:11:28.988\nWe don't have the key performance\nindicators that Daniel needed to\n\n214\n00:11:28.988 --> 00:11:30.160\nunderstand.\n\n215\n00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.020\nAnd he goes, well Ronnie I just\nthought you said you need 1,000,\n\n216\n00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:34.970\nyou didn't tell me when you needed to buy.\n\n217\n00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.800\nYou didn't tell me where\nI should be along this.\n\n218\n00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.110\nSo, how do I know if I'm going to hit\nthat 1,000 before end of the week or not?\n\n219\n00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.640\nWell at this point,\nDaniel, you're not, okay?\n\n220\n00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.400\nBut that's how, right?\n\n221\n00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:51.260\nSo involved in that scope is really\nkeeping that indication going on.\n\n222\n00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.670\nThat the scope is gonna remain valid, and\n\n223\n00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.870\nhere's how we know that we're actually\ngonna accomplish everything in that scope.\n\n224\n00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.300\nWe're gonna have these\nperformance indicators.\n\n225\n00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.590\nWe're gonna be monitoring.\n\n226\n00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.960\nWe're gonna be bringing\nit back into action.\n\n227\n00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.050\nSo, sometimes it is directly where you\ncan go to someone that's working on\n\n228\n00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:11.250\nthe project and that project package\nright away and be able to verify it.\n\n229\n00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.410\nA lot of times, though,\nespecially as a project manager,\n\n230\n00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:19.680\nwhat you're gonna look at, instead,\nis gonna be a very high level overview and\n\n231\n00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.480\nsomething that we call an EVM,\nor Earned Value Management.\n\n232\n00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.150\nNow, when you talk about\nthe idea of earned value, okay?\n\n233\n00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:31.250\nNormally we actually have what\nwe have in terms of money.\n\n234\n00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.350\nLet's just use money as an example here.\n\n235\n00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:37.670\nWhat is budgeted, okay,\nat the time that the project began.\n\n236\n00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.770\nIn other words what is budgeted, okay?\n\n237\n00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.300\nWhen we began we said\nwe had this much money.\n\n238\n00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.030\nWe now take a look at where we are.\n\n239\n00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:48.710\nAnd then, we can actually now\nsay well in comparison here,\n\n240\n00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:51.560\nokay, I should have\nthis much value by now.\n\n241\n00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.480\nBased on where I should be right now.\n\n242\n00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:58.100\nSo I can actually compare the amount\nof money let's say that I spent\n\n243\n00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.010\nat one point versus the amount of\nmoney that I'm spending right now.\n\n244\n00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:02.980\nWhat I actually have on hand here.\n\n245\n00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:07.230\nAnd be able to realize,\nwe're kind of behind by $10,000 here.\n\n246\n00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.920\nWhatever it might be,\nthat I should actually go ahead,\n\n247\n00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.370\nlook, we're actually not\nearning our value right now.\n\n248\n00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.110\nWe need to speed up that process,\nwe need to do other things.\n\n249\n00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:21.300\nNow there's also other things we have\non our schedule as we start doing this.\n\n250\n00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.690\nAnd inside of our scope here\nthat should indicate that\n\n251\n00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.730\nwe are actually where we need to be.\n\n252\n00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:28.770\nTo accomplish what the scope is.\n\n253\n00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:34.340\nAnd this is another one that I marked\nhere with a couple of asterisks as well,\n\n254\n00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:39.520\nwhich is what we'll call, key success,\ncritical success factors.\n\n255\n00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.150\nNow I couldn't figure out a way\nto actually just quickly figure,\n\n256\n00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.830\ntry to tell you what this was so\nI wrote it down here.\n\n257\n00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:49.270\nIt's the work that has to be\ncompleted in two different ways.\n\n258\n00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.970\nFirst of all, with entire accuracy.\n\n259\n00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:57.100\nAnd then secondly, in the time\nthat we called on it to complete.\n\n260\n00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:01.320\nSo it's not just enough that Daniel\nproduces the box that he says he can, But\n\n261\n00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.670\nhe needs to be able to produce all 1,000\nof them in the time that I gave him.\n\n262\n00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.940\nAnd that actually shows us that\nthat's a critical success factor\n\n263\n00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.010\nbecause of how scheduling\nends up working out here.\n\n264\n00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.380\nSo there are certain things that we\nknow that if Daniel doesn't get it done\n\n265\n00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:17.820\nthen the rest of the project\nbegins to fall behind.\n\n266\n00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:21.090\nBecause we don't have that\ncritical success factor\n\n267\n00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.870\nthat we thought we would have to\nkeep everything else on track.\n\n268\n00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.320\nSo this means that if you\ndon't know what they are for\n\n269\n00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.510\nyour project,\nit means you need to determine that, okay?\n\n270\n00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.150\nYou need to determine that\non the scope basis here.\n\n271\n00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:37.150\nLook, here is how we know that\nwe're gonna successfully compute\n\n272\n00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.820\nour project scope here and\nstay within the project scope\n\n273\n00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:45.120\nIs this critical success factor that\nwe're looking for along the way.\n\n274\n00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.410\nSo, that's also another part of it.\n\n275\n00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:50.140\nNow there's also estimates that we can do,\nand\n\n276\n00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.170\nthat means there's some guessing\nthat we have to have on hand.\n\n277\n00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:57.920\nThe reason why is what the end of\nour scope, the project deliverable.\n\n278\n00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.020\nEverything at the end here is really\nbased on something in the future that.\n\n279\n00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:02.870\nWe can't determine.\n\n280\n00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.860\nWe've talked about, in other episodes,\nthere are things that get in our way.\n\n281\n00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.220\nCould be a work stoppage, right?\n\n282\n00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.020\nStrikes can happen.\n\n283\n00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.530\nSomebody actually says, we're not\nproducing that until this happens.\n\n284\n00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:13.580\nIt can be weather.\n\n285\n00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.210\nIt can be so\n\n286\n00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:18.990\nmany different things which can actually\neffect the outcome of our project.\n\n287\n00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:20.820\nThese are things we should consider.\n\n288\n00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.520\nBut, how do you do so when you can't\nreally plan for stuff like that to happen?\n\n289\n00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.300\nBut what you can do then is you can\nactually create one called time and\n\n290\n00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.420\ncost estimates as well.\n\n291\n00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:33.630\nNow, they're not asking for\nsuper detail here unlike the objectives.\n\n292\n00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.230\nWhat we're looking for\nis a very high level overview.\n\n293\n00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.830\nAnd the term that you\nwant to keep it in mind\n\n294\n00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:43.960\nis actually what we call the idea of\norder of magnitude types of estimates.\n\n295\n00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.700\nNow, that sounds pretty impressive.\n\n296\n00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.310\nOrder of magnitude, yes,\nthat sounds interesting.\n\n297\n00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.154\nIt's really not that interesting,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n298\n00:15:50.154 --> 00:15:52.792\nBut what it means is if\nyou can't figure out\n\n299\n00:15:52.792 --> 00:15:57.497\nby the factors that are around you as\nfar as details, you can always do what?\n\n300\n00:15:57.497 --> 00:16:02.373\nGo historical, which is you take a\ncomparable project, of comparable size and\n\n301\n00:16:02.373 --> 00:16:04.960\ncomparable scope, and you do what?\n\n302\n00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.560\nYou base it off of that.\n\n303\n00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.520\nYou say this is the same order and\nmagnitude that they had and\n\n304\n00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.020\nI'm working with a project\nteam about the same size.\n\n305\n00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.500\nWe're trying to produce kinda\nthe same amount of deliverables or\n\n306\n00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.930\nthe same type of deliverable here.\n\n307\n00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.690\nWell, we actually make\nsure that we compare.\n\n308\n00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:26.970\nIt's not fair that we need to compare\none particular project of one size\n\n309\n00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:30.080\nversus one that's eight times larger and\nsay, well.\n\n310\n00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:35.000\nIf I were doing this in comparison to\nbuilding this bridge across a valley,\n\n311\n00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.220\nI'm way ahead of schedule.\n\n312\n00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:40.140\nIt's like you trying to say how\nold you are Daniel says, well,\n\n313\n00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:45.690\nif you look at me in terms of the age\nof a mountain, I'm young, but compared\n\n314\n00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:51.770\nto a head of cabbage though, Daniel\nyou would kind of be the ancient one.\n\n315\n00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:56.580\nSo it has to be the same order of\nmagnitude is what we're saying, and\n\n316\n00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.170\na lot of estimates have to come from that,\n\n317\n00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:01.380\nit's comparing apples to apples,\nnot apples to oranges.\n\n318\n00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:04.940\nBut you might go,\ndo people actually do that?\n\n319\n00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.270\nYou better believe it.\n\n320\n00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.120\nWhy do they do that?\n\n321\n00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.310\nBecause they know something on estimates.\n\n322\n00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:11.750\nWe can skew the estimate\nhowever we want to.\n\n323\n00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:15.530\nSo, as long as you actually skew that\nestimate you can always make it look\n\n324\n00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:19.020\nbetter in your favor even at\nthe beginning stages here.\n\n325\n00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.350\nWhen you're talking about\ndoing the scope statement, but\n\n326\n00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:24.480\nin reality, you want to make sure that\nyou really do compare apples to apples.\n\n327\n00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.690\n>> Ronnie, are you trying to tell us\nthat people cherry-pick their data\n\n328\n00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.435\nto have a more favorable\noutcome in your estimation?\n\n329\n00:17:30.435 --> 00:17:32.160\n>> [LAUGH] Well,\nif you think about it, right,\n\n330\n00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.210\nit really does work out because there's no\nreal data that backs anything up, right?\n\n331\n00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:38.180\nYou're essentially really,\n\n332\n00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.840\nright before the planning stage\nreally gets started, right?\n\n333\n00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.250\nYou don't really have any hard facts and\ndata and what you can do is you can look\n\n334\n00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:50.460\nat different projects and\neven kind of the name of the project and\n\n335\n00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.130\nkind of get away with things and\nthe way that people name a project.\n\n336\n00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.630\nLike that sounds like a similar project\nand that project may have a million\n\n337\n00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.310\ndollars more in budget than\nwhat you have to deal with.\n\n338\n00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.670\nYou go I'm gonna compare it\nagainst that and then show them.\n\n339\n00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.910\nHey look I'm doing this for\nunder the cost here.\n\n340\n00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:09.430\nI'm coming in at $250 and\nthat guy took a million dollar to do so.\n\n341\n00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.750\nThen when you really do\ncompare you find out something\n\n342\n00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:17.180\nthat that particular one\nproduced this much more or.\n\n343\n00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.310\nDid this wonderful thing that yours is\nreally only improving a little bit on\n\n344\n00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:25.950\nwhat they did, so you gotta actually\ndo the same thing, order of magnitude.\n\n345\n00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:29.180\nAnd of course, you need to know\nwhat your constraints are,\n\n346\n00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:35.090\nyou need to make sure that you\nunderstand those limitations of quality,\n\n347\n00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:39.960\ncost, and time is what we actually\nreally have to take a look at.\n\n348\n00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.520\nNow you're probably going,\nRonnie there is no way,\n\n349\n00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:47.240\nthere's no possibility that I'm gonna\nremember all of that on any one day.\n\n350\n00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.200\nWell, that's why you have, what?\n\n351\n00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.670\nOrganizational assets that you go into and\nthat you bring about and\n\n352\n00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.660\nyou think about as well.\n\n353\n00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.790\nSo let me go ahead and there's a couple\nof other things I'm going to point out.\n\n354\n00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.200\nI have one more here.\n\n355\n00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.025\nYeah I'm about to sum up already.\n\n356\n00:19:02.025 --> 00:19:04.811\nI shouldn't some up when none\nof us have it finished here.\n\n357\n00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:07.904\nWhen I'm not done, the other thing\nthat you also want to consider\n\n358\n00:19:07.904 --> 00:19:11.250\nof course in your scope statement\nthen is an assumptions.\n\n359\n00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.640\nNow we don't really like\nto make assumptions but\n\n360\n00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.970\nremember that when talking about\nassumption at this point it's not about\n\n361\n00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.720\nyou assume that and you shouldn't have.\n\n362\n00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.320\nWhat we're saying is what do we believe is\ngenerally gonna be accepted as being true?\n\n363\n00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:27.030\nSo at this, it doesn't matter\nwhether it's true or not.\n\n364\n00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:28.300\nYou're making certain assumptions.\n\n365\n00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.900\nAnd we've talked about this before.\n\n366\n00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.970\nThat there are certain\nassumptions you can count on.\n\n367\n00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.820\nThat you're assuming that\nyou will be here tomorrow.\n\n368\n00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.360\nYou may not be, but I hope you are.\n\n369\n00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.760\nI'm assuming you're\ngonna be here tomorrow.\n\n370\n00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:41.800\n>> That gravity works.\n\n371\n00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.105\n>> That gravity ends up working,\nstuff like that.\n\n372\n00:19:44.105 --> 00:19:45.288\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the very fact is\n\n373\n00:19:45.288 --> 00:19:48.889\nyou have to actually make sure that\nyou do make certain assumptions\n\n374\n00:19:48.889 --> 00:19:51.994\nabout your project that it's\ngoing to complete on time.\n\n375\n00:19:51.994 --> 00:19:55.720\nYou're gonna do certain things but make\nsure that you actually note that right?\n\n376\n00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:00.000\nThat these are assumptions, I can't prove\nit but I generally believe that it's gonna\n\n377\n00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.310\nbe true and then if somebody\nsays well how do you know?\n\n378\n00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:06.190\nWell that's when you can do some backup\nand actually figure that out as well.\n\n379\n00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.920\n>> This is starting to sound\nlike a philosophical debate.\n\n380\n00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.220\n[LAUGH]\n>> It really can be cuz there's some\n\n381\n00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.310\npeople who say you shouldn't\ninclude assumptions in the project\n\n382\n00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.390\nscope statement.\n\n383\n00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:18.310\nBut the reality is, right, we-\n>> Don't really have much choice do you?\n\n384\n00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.610\n>> Yeah,\nyou don't really have much of a choice.\n\n385\n00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:21.820\nThere are some things you will presuppose.\n\n386\n00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.560\nBut our boss says it best,\n\n387\n00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.620\nyou know that a lot of times\nyour perception is your reality.\n\n388\n00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:30.670\nAnd so, even if you work from a little\nbit of a slightly skewed perspective,\n\n389\n00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:31.796\nthat's the guys right here.\n\n390\n00:20:31.796 --> 00:20:33.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All the time.\n\n391\n00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:36.820\nIt's what your reality is and\nthat's the way that you'll view things and\n\n392\n00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.380\nwhat will end up happening.\n\n393\n00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:42.570\nSo, when you start doing that,\nwhen you hear people talk you'll hear it.\n\n394\n00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:46.440\nSome people are just all the time,\nthey're very optimistic.\n\n395\n00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.420\nWhich is great.\n\n396\n00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.770\nIt makes you fell good.\n\n397\n00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.690\nBut if you're like me, you're a little bit\nmore pessimistic about a lot of things.\n\n398\n00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:57.080\nSo you kind of go well who's assumption\nshould we go on at that point\n\n399\n00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.460\nwhen you take a look at\na particular project.\n\n400\n00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.840\nSo it really is,\nit's a good thing in the scope, right?\n\n401\n00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.170\nThat people understand what your\nparticular assumption is and\n\n402\n00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.620\nwhy you actually chose to\ndo they things you do.\n\n403\n00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.130\nOr you have people second guessing you\nconstantly if they don't understand\n\n404\n00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:15.050\nwhat your assumption is going to be.\n\n405\n00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.230\nSo, that's why you want to make\nsure you take care of that.\n\n406\n00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:17.800\n>> Awesome, Ronnie.\n\n407\n00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.410\nWell we've definitely, I think we covered\n\n408\n00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:25.230\nthat second major point that you want\nto get through on this scope creation.\n\n409\n00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:26.470\nLet's move on to the third.\n\n410\n00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.130\nYou have a lovely third-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n411\n00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.407\n>> I can't get it out.\n\n412\n00:21:30.407 --> 00:21:31.480\nrubbing off on me here.\n\n413\n00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.482\nHe's infected me with\nthe inability to talk.\n\n414\n00:21:33.482 --> 00:21:35.274\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know, I can't believe it.\n\n415\n00:21:35.274 --> 00:21:37.459\n>> But let's take a look at something\nbefore we move there to that\n\n416\n00:21:37.459 --> 00:21:38.350\nvalidating scope here.\n\n417\n00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:39.170\n>> You've got one more.\n\n418\n00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:40.690\n>> Yeah, just a little bit.\n\n419\n00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:42.890\nNow remember that everything\nthat we do here for\n\n420\n00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:48.450\na CompTIA Project+, we kinda went through\nthat material that they want us to do.\n\n421\n00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.550\nThey say that on the CompTIA exam if you\ngo an download the objectives from CompTIA\n\n422\n00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:54.650\nthey'll tell you a lot of\nthis is based on the PEMBOC.\n\n423\n00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:58.550\nThey don't use PEMBOC but\na lot of it's based on that PEMBOC and so\n\n424\n00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:02.250\nwhen the PEMBOC talks about creating\na scope statement which we don't.\n\n425\n00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.030\nThis is what should be in it so\nyou should be able to create it.\n\n426\n00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:09.200\nBut here, remember that they're taking all\nthe stuff that's actually come up before,\n\n427\n00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.280\nthat they've generated before,\nthe management plan now exists,\n\n428\n00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.110\na project charter, you name it.\n\n429\n00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.900\nYou now have these other documents here,\nand\n\n430\n00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.490\nthey run that through all of their\nparticular tools and techniques.\n\n431\n00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:23.590\nNow, the only one that's different here,\nis this third one that we\n\n432\n00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:26.590\nhaven't mentioned, which is\nthe idea of alternative generation.\n\n433\n00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.110\nI wanted to make sure we covered this,\njust briefly here.\n\n434\n00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:32.080\nAnd what this means is that\nyour scope statement, right?\n\n435\n00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.530\nCan actually be generated and everybody\nactually agree except for one person.\n\n436\n00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:41.110\nDon't discard the way that\nthey see that scope because\n\n437\n00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:44.230\nyou may find that something they\nactually do have a reality here\n\n438\n00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.640\nthat they're actually trying to\npoint out that says hey look.\n\n439\n00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.260\nThis is gonna be great or\nthis is not gonna be great.\n\n440\n00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.670\nYou need to actually give room for\n\n441\n00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:54.910\nthat that somebody else can generate\nan alternative scope statement that may be\n\n442\n00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.980\nbetter than yours, and nobody likes\nto admit that but it's possibly true.\n\n443\n00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:03.660\nAnd then when you do so, you'll end up\nwith your project scope statement overall,\n\n444\n00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.630\nas well as you have to update all the\nother documents that come through that,\n\n445\n00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:10.160\nand so when you take a look\nat something like this,\n\n446\n00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.980\nhow is it that you begin to generate that.\n\n447\n00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.150\nWell, you have to actually deal with this,\nright?\n\n448\n00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:18.020\nSo, you can actually find templates\nout there, again you can go and\n\n449\n00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:22.095\ndo that Google search,\nhere's the one that I created as well and\n\n450\n00:23:22.095 --> 00:23:24.725\nso now, what you can do is\nyou can simply fill it out.\n\n451\n00:23:24.725 --> 00:23:25.535\nNow I went ahead and\n\n452\n00:23:25.535 --> 00:23:29.155\nput in you know a kind of descriptions\nabout what should go here.\n\n453\n00:23:29.155 --> 00:23:31.185\nAll right, so here it is and\n\n454\n00:23:31.185 --> 00:23:35.655\nas you take a look right now you can\nfind very many, you know different ones.\n\n455\n00:23:35.655 --> 00:23:38.145\nBut I essentially just categorize them,\nright?\n\n456\n00:23:38.145 --> 00:23:42.615\nProject objectives, scope definition,\nrequirements, boundaries,\n\n457\n00:23:42.615 --> 00:23:45.145\ndeliverables, acceptance criteria.\n\n458\n00:23:45.145 --> 00:23:47.580\nThese are all the things that\nwe already talked about, right?\n\n459\n00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.290\nAnd I just kind of put them in\nthis table is what I did, and\n\n460\n00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:52.734\nput a little description\nbeside each one of them.\n\n461\n00:23:52.734 --> 00:23:55.042\nAnd this gives you really\nkind of a checklist.\n\n462\n00:23:55.042 --> 00:23:58.481\nA great way you can begin when you start\ntalking about creating your own scope\n\n463\n00:23:58.481 --> 00:23:59.520\nstatement.\n\n464\n00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.590\nAnd then you can pass that out as\nkind of a generic template for\n\n465\n00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:05.690\neverybody else on your team that\nyou're gonna be coordinating with.\n\n466\n00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.850\nAnd then they can work based\noff of this thing too.\n\n467\n00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:11.170\nSo just realize that there's\nplenty of help out there,\n\n468\n00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:14.160\neven if you've never created one,\nto be able to do that.\n\n469\n00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:19.100\nSo now this is where we get to the point\nthat Daniel was actually trying to get\n\n470\n00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:19.940\nto, as well.\n\n471\n00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.155\n>> I just like doing this\nbecause I like to argue.\n\n472\n00:24:22.155 --> 00:24:23.830\n[LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely.\n\n473\n00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:27.770\nSo the last thing that we also have to\ndo is we need to validate It's easy\n\n474\n00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:32.130\nenough to come up and say, I've created\nthe only scope statement that's needed but\n\n475\n00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:35.340\nwe really need buy in and\nthat's what we really need at this point.\n\n476\n00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.960\nSo, even after everything is ready and\n\n477\n00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.650\nwe can show that we can manage the scope,\nwe have a scope statement.\n\n478\n00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.880\nWe need people to be able to accept that\nthat's what the scope statement is gonna\n\n479\n00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.830\nbe and that requires you to be a little\nbit more political, I don't know\n\n480\n00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:53.360\nhow else to describe it, I guess it's\nprobably the best way to describe it here.\n\n481\n00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:58.480\nIn which you actually validate the scope\nstatement with the stake holders.\n\n482\n00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.400\nNow it's very easy for\n\n483\n00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:04.860\nyou to validate whatever you think you\njustify, all the thoughts that you have.\n\n484\n00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.850\nAnd you go this is perfect, this is great.\n\n485\n00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:09.380\nBut you now need to be\nable to present it to\n\n486\n00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.990\nthose who that are actually\ngonna stakeholders on it.\n\n487\n00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.400\nSo that what you do is you review it.\n\n488\n00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.970\nWhat the project team and verify that\nthey understand what it's about.\n\n489\n00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.900\nYou answer the questions\nthat they have about it.\n\n490\n00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.450\nAny concerns that they have.\n\n491\n00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:24.380\nThings that you might\nnot have thought about.\n\n492\n00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.110\nAnd then you present it to\nthe project stakeholders.\n\n493\n00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:28.554\nAnd you let them do the same thing.\n\n494\n00:25:28.554 --> 00:25:29.965\n>> Like being in Shark Tank.\n\n495\n00:25:29.965 --> 00:25:33.240\n[LAUGH] It really is, you get to go\nin there and pitch your idea and\n\n496\n00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.280\nsay, this is why it's a good idea and\nyou should invest your money.\n\n497\n00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.610\nSame kind of idea really.\n\n498\n00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:41.070\n>> By far that's a great analogy\nthere because Shark Tank\n\n499\n00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:42.520\ndoes something very neat right?\n\n500\n00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.600\nYou have a million dollar idea,\nwell those guys who have experience in it,\n\n501\n00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:51.680\nthey're gonna validate whether or not your\nidea is actually the million dollar idea.\n\n502\n00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.850\nThe same thing here with your scope.\n\n503\n00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:58.440\nIs it actually going to be validated that\nwhat you see as being the reality of\n\n504\n00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.180\nthe scope of this project,\nis actually what they see as well?\n\n505\n00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.960\nAnd that's actually key,\nbecause without that validation, and\n\n506\n00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:10.080\nyou begin anyways, you go,\nI'm gonna force this thing through,\n\n507\n00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.340\nyou are now actually starting\nyour project uphill, okay?\n\n508\n00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:15.060\nIt's an uphill battle at this point.\n\n509\n00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:19.440\nSo you wanna make sure that last thing\nthat you do is that you get a sign off\n\n510\n00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:23.770\nfrom the project sponsor on the scope\nstatement itself, as well as the major and\n\n511\n00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:26.300\nkey stakeholders too.\n\n512\n00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:30.830\nBecause without that, right, the very fact\nof support that could actually make or\n\n513\n00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:33.620\nbreak this project Is actually right here.\n\n514\n00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.860\nSo you wanna make sure that they know\nwhat you're actually seeing as being\n\n515\n00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:40.080\nthe overall scope of this project, too.\n\n516\n00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.990\nSo don't again assume that\nthey're gonna understand.\n\n517\n00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:46.310\nMake sure that they understand as well.\n\n518\n00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:50.700\nSo I'm just bringing up this last little\nbit here, too, that when you take a look\n\n519\n00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:55.110\nfrom the PEMBOT perspective, they again\nare just taking all of the actual\n\n520\n00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:58.690\nproduction from this point in terms\nof planning and documentation,\n\n521\n00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:03.800\nand you see this here, project management\nplan, requirements documentation.\n\n522\n00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.970\nYou may not have actually seen the idea\nof the traceability matrix before,\n\n523\n00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:09.510\nhere are the requirements.\n\n524\n00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:11.900\nBut this is about being\nable to trace back, right?\n\n525\n00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.730\nThe paperwork that goes back and\n\n526\n00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:16.250\nfigure out where everything\nactually belongs together.\n\n527\n00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:19.270\nThat you have verified deliverables\non hand, work performance data.\n\n528\n00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.580\nAnd anything that you can do, okay?\n\n529\n00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:25.730\nGoes into that and now you actually\npresent that to your stakeholders here\n\n530\n00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:29.080\nin the inspection time,\nwhich is actually kinda key And\n\n531\n00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.690\nthen you come up and validate what\nthe scope is actually gonna be.\n\n532\n00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:34.320\nUltimately, when everything\nas she comes out,\n\n533\n00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:38.350\nyou will end up with those deliverables,\nnow accepted.\n\n534\n00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:41.780\nOkay, you'll have now your\nformal change requests,\n\n535\n00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:45.701\nyou have work performance information\nat least according to them and\n\n536\n00:27:45.701 --> 00:27:48.780\nof course project document that\nthey update all that but then,\n\n537\n00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:53.290\nyou also have your project scope\nstatements that will now actually be\n\n538\n00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:56.940\nkey and ready to go when you start\nplanning out the rest of your project.\n\n539\n00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.790\nSo there's a lot that goes into\nbuilding the scope statement, but\n\n540\n00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:01.690\nwhat you're doing is what?\n\n541\n00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:06.100\nYou're setting up the documents and\nthe tone so that there's no\n\n542\n00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:10.605\ndispute about this and you're gonna\nhave this publicized somehow published.\n\n543\n00:28:10.605 --> 00:28:15.070\nSo that so everybody can actually\nsee that clear work has gone on and\n\n544\n00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:17.740\nthat this is a good and solid project.\n\n545\n00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:21.000\n>> Yeah, this isn't some flight of fancy\nthat somebody came up with one day,\n\n546\n00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.900\nthis will be a good idea let's try this\nout, they've actually put some thought\n\n547\n00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.510\nbehind it, they've seen that you put\nthe work and invested the time and effort,\n\n548\n00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:33.330\nTo formulate it and systematize that\nthis would be beneficial for them.\n\n549\n00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:36.310\nAnd then they're gonna say well yeah,\nI wanna be a part of that and\n\n550\n00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:37.560\nthen they'll validate the scope.\n\n551\n00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.140\nBecause obviously you put the time and\neffort into that as well.\n\n552\n00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:42.870\nSaying this is about how\nlong we think it's gonna be.\n\n553\n00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:46.070\nAnd they agree that that is an acceptable\namount of time, right Ronnie?\n\n554\n00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:49.040\n>> That's definitely what\nwe want here at the very\n\n555\n00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.350\nend of the process that\nwe're taking a look at.\n\n556\n00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:55.380\nThe neat thing is, once you have this\nin hand, right, this is now where you\n\n557\n00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.950\nhave the sign off, you have the project\ncharter that says planning can begin.\n\n558\n00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:03.210\nYou've essentially started that initial\ntype of thing here with being able to say,\n\n559\n00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:08.000\nI know the scope that I'm looking at and\nI know how to manage that scope.\n\n560\n00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.980\n>> And we're gonna see a lot of the actual\nother planning processes in hand here, but\n\n561\n00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:15.550\nthis is where it really does\nkind of officially kick off\n\n562\n00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:17.820\nas far as the planning part goes.\n\n563\n00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.480\nWe're not actually talking about\neverything else here, but planning,\n\n564\n00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.330\nthis is really the great place to begin is\nmaking sure that everybody's clear about\n\n565\n00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:27.520\nwhat you're actually trying to plan and\nfigure out to do for\n\n566\n00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.550\nthe project to get done\nit's all right here.\n\n567\n00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:30.780\n>> Well, excellent stuff, Ronnie.\n\n568\n00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.780\nObviously you've taken\nthis from start to finish.\n\n569\n00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:37.710\nAt least when it come to the planning\nportion of our scope statement and\n\n570\n00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.820\nI think you did a really good job.\n\n571\n00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:41.560\nIs there anything else\nthat you want to add to?\n\n572\n00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.060\nLittle addendums or sides or anything?\n\n573\n00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.280\n>> Not really at this point, Ry,\n\n574\n00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:49.670\nbecause there is much more that can go\nin to every little step that we have.\n\n575\n00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:52.440\n>> We can break it down\ninto the very minutia but\n\n576\n00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:56.280\noverall understanding that this is just\nthat it really is the beginning that we're\n\n577\n00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:01.650\nplanning for our project management\nplan is gonna take place.\n\n578\n00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:02.910\nThis now sets that tone.\n\n579\n00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:05.770\nIt's pretty much the key and you want to\nmake sure that you understand that when\n\n580\n00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.290\nyou get ready to go and\nface the exam as well.\n\n581\n00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:10.790\n>> Well, excellent stuff Ronnie,\nit's a really good stuff.\n\n582\n00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:13.860\nWe appreciate you stopping by and\nexplaining this to

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.928 --> 00:00:18.540\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.430\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our Project+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.970\nJoining me back in the studio today to\nlend his expertise on that very topic\n\n6\n00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.710\nis our good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.040\nRonnie, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.520\n>> Well, thank you for having me back on\nthe show as we continue to take a look\n\n9\n00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.480\nat more of the CompTIA Project+.\n\n10\n00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.830\nAnd we are moving into talking about what\na work breakdown structure actually is.\n\n11\n00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.340\nNow, this actually comes immediately\nafter, if you're following along in\n\n12\n00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.460\nthe series here, where we talked about the\nplanning out the project scope statement,\n\n13\n00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.000\nas well as planning out\nthe management of the project scope.\n\n14\n00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.200\nAnd one of those elements that actually\ngets involved in that particular\n\n15\n00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.010\nsituation, of course, is gonna be what\nwe call a work breakdown structure.\n\n16\n00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.768\nNow, everybody tends to actually use this\nterminology a little bit differently.\n\n17\n00:01:04.768 --> 00:01:07.809\nBut it is an industry-wide\nterm that you tend\n\n18\n00:01:07.809 --> 00:01:12.970\nto hear when you talk about the idea\nof this work breakdown structure.\n\n19\n00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.837\nSo we wanna make sure we understand what's\nactually involved in a work breakdown\n\n20\n00:01:16.837 --> 00:01:20.560\nstructure and why we need to actually use\nit, and why this is actually something\n\n21\n00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.270\nimportant for us as we actually move\nin to the realm of project management.\n\n22\n00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.930\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen as we begin here.\n\n23\n00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.950\nAnd that way this will kind of\nhelp us out when we take a look\n\n24\n00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.310\njust a little bit more.\n\n25\n00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.838\nSo what in the world is the purpose of\nthat work breakdown structure or WBS?\n\n26\n00:01:38.838 --> 00:01:41.276\nThat's more than likely what\nyou'll hear people refer to it,\n\n27\n00:01:41.276 --> 00:01:42.934\nnot necessarily the idea work breakdown.\n\n28\n00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:45.222\nAnd I was teasing with Daniel\nright before the show,\n\n29\n00:01:45.222 --> 00:01:47.518\nI know I'm gonna say work\nbreak dance at some point.\n\n30\n00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:49.817\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And everybody's gonna stop and pop and\n\n31\n00:01:49.817 --> 00:01:51.100\nlock and do all that stuff.\n\n32\n00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.770\nBut it's not gonna happen today,\nat least I don't think so.\n\n33\n00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.690\nBut this is what we're talking about here,\nokay.\n\n34\n00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.750\nNow, remember that if you take\na look at the previous show where\n\n35\n00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.390\nwe talked about that scope statement, as\nwell as the scope management plan, okay.\n\n36\n00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.520\nWe described that and\n\n37\n00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.260\nwe said that it needs to actually\nbe put down in written form.\n\n38\n00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.120\nAnd that is pretty much\nthe key document for us.\n\n39\n00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.012\nBut when we start to actually try and\nmake work happen,\n\n40\n00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:21.010\nright, what we need is something\na little bit more visual.\n\n41\n00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.870\nIn other words, we need to be able to\nunderstand that it's not just a sentence\n\n42\n00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.930\nwe're looking at, but\n\n43\n00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.290\nthat this is something that we\nare really gonna end up dealing with.\n\n44\n00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.066\nAnd so a lot of the work breakdown\nstructure types of software that's out\n\n45\n00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:33.693\nthere and\n\n46\n00:02:33.693 --> 00:02:38.718\nsome of the ways that we tend to do this\nis not by making gigantic paragraphs.\n\n47\n00:02:38.718 --> 00:02:43.073\nBut simply by making boxes if we need to\nand then adding in the elements in there\n\n48\n00:02:43.073 --> 00:02:46.959\nthat show that we understand what\na work breakdown structure is, and\n\n49\n00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.210\nwhat a work package is as well.\n\n50\n00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.370\nSo, first of all,\n\n51\n00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.240\nit gives us a very graphic display of\nthe entirety of the project's scope.\n\n52\n00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.020\nNow, when I say that, we actually\ndo see where we're saying that,\n\n53\n00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.480\nhey, this graphic element does represent\nthe entire scope of the project, and\n\n54\n00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.810\nactually really represents\nthe work of the project as well.\n\n55\n00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.710\nAnd then we start actually\nkind of analyzing that and\n\n56\n00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.840\nbreaking them down into\nsmaller needs as well.\n\n57\n00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.830\nThe other reason that we also need to\ncreate this work breakdown structure\n\n58\n00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.720\nis that what we're gonna see\nduring the remaining of our\n\n59\n00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.680\nplanning process here, right?\n\n60\n00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.300\nWhich is gonna be the longest of\nthe five phases that we spend in project\n\n61\n00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.390\nmanagement.\n\n62\n00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.150\nIs that the work breakdown structure, as\nfar as the elements that we get out of it,\n\n63\n00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.060\nreally help us to go into a whole bunch of\nother processes that are actually there.\n\n64\n00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.180\nSo if you wanna talk about a key and\n\n65\n00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.870\na pivotal element that you really need\nto spend time creating, it's this.\n\n66\n00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.470\nDaniel, if you take a look here\nI've got four different elements,\n\n67\n00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.080\nat least four, and we might even see\nmore here, that we normally use.\n\n68\n00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.380\nAnd you tell me if these are important\nelements or not, Daniel.\n\n69\n00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.476\nSo if I were to tell you that hey,\n\n70\n00:03:56.476 --> 00:04:01.548\nI'm gonna actually need to create\nthe activity duration or a task duration.\n\n71\n00:04:01.548 --> 00:04:04.907\nAnd one of the elements that I have to\nhave before I can do that is understanding\n\n72\n00:04:04.907 --> 00:04:06.368\nthe work package that's there.\n\n73\n00:04:06.368 --> 00:04:08.380\nYou would say that that's\nan important element, right?\n\n74\n00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.750\n>> Yeah,\nthat's definitely an important element.\n\n75\n00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.890\n>> Yeah, so overall though,\nif you think about it,\n\n76\n00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.500\nright, we're saying that\nreally we can't accomplish\n\n77\n00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.980\nthe estimation of even trying to figure\nout how long a particular activity is.\n\n78\n00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.670\nWe don't know the work\nthat's involved in it.\n\n79\n00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.480\nAnd so that's why this is important.\n\n80\n00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.400\nAlso what we call about\nEstimating Work Effort here.\n\n81\n00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.630\nNow, work effort is when we do\nend up kind of qualifying, right,\n\n82\n00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.160\nthe idea of whether a task\nactually requires effort.\n\n83\n00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.172\nIn other words, do more resources make\nthe actual task duration shorten?\n\n84\n00:04:41.172 --> 00:04:45.152\nOr do adding in more resources\ndon't make the task shorten?\n\n85\n00:04:45.152 --> 00:04:47.664\nNow you may have heard that\nterm before and you go, man,\n\n86\n00:04:47.664 --> 00:04:49.012\nI know I've heard that term.\n\n87\n00:04:49.012 --> 00:04:51.645\nCompTIA doesn't really\nrefer to it too often, but\n\n88\n00:04:51.645 --> 00:04:55.570\nthe idea of work effort is\nsomething that's very important.\n\n89\n00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.940\nSo, let's kind of understand\nsomething like this.\n\n90\n00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.283\nLet's say that Daniel and\nI were assigned to a brand new house and\n\n91\n00:05:02.283 --> 00:05:07.289\nwe actually need to put in the first\ninterior coat of a single room, okay.\n\n92\n00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:11.914\nSo here it is, we've got a dinning room\nthat we're supposed to slap paint up\n\n93\n00:05:11.914 --> 00:05:14.640\non in whatever the initial color is.\n\n94\n00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.090\nWell, in that particular situation,\nDaniel and\n\n95\n00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.120\nI are assigned to it and let's say that\nwe're given three hours to do the work.\n\n96\n00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.940\nAnd now we realize something, we've\nonly got an hour left to do the work.\n\n97\n00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.025\nWell, would assigning a third person\nhelp us to finish that room quicker,?\n\n98\n00:05:30.025 --> 00:05:34.200\nWell, absolutely, the very fact is it\nreally would help because now we have\n\n99\n00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.620\nthree paint brushes\ngoing at the same time.\n\n100\n00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.250\nEach of us could take a wall and\n\n101\n00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.050\nthen all three of us could work\non that final wall together.\n\n102\n00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.530\nIt'd be up within that last hour\neven if I didn't realize that.\n\n103\n00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.380\nBut that's the idea of work effort.\n\n104\n00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.208\nBut we've all seen this before too,\nDaniel.\n\n105\n00:05:48.208 --> 00:05:50.746\nYou've probably seen that and\nyou've probably made the same,\n\n106\n00:05:50.746 --> 00:05:53.156\nI say I don't want to be cliche and\nI'm going to use a cliche.\n\n107\n00:05:53.156 --> 00:05:55.731\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so every episode I say that,\n\n108\n00:05:55.731 --> 00:05:58.520\nI end up using a cliche, it's pretty bad.\n\n109\n00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.210\nBut overall though,\nwhen we take a look at this,\n\n110\n00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.600\nespecially construction that happens\non the side of the road, right?\n\n111\n00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.480\nAnd traffic jams are going on.\n\n112\n00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.115\nWe've all made the comment before, and I'm\nassuming it's gonna be true everywhere,\n\n113\n00:06:10.115 --> 00:06:11.930\nnot just here in the states.\n\n114\n00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.480\nThat you go, why is there one\nguy down there digging, and\n\n115\n00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.400\n12 guys are standing around,\nand more people are coming in?\n\n116\n00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.126\nWell, it seems to actually not matter that\nthe more people that you add into that,\n\n117\n00:06:22.126 --> 00:06:25.270\nthe work's not actually being\naccomplished any quicker.\n\n118\n00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.130\nSo even if there's 15\nguys standing around,\n\n119\n00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.090\nit's actually still 1\nperson doing the work.\n\n120\n00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.050\nAnd the reason why is maybe that hole\nthat's actually there is only big enough\n\n121\n00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.750\nfor one person to be there.\n\n122\n00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.970\nSo you can only have one shovel at a time\nbut then there actually just handing it\n\n123\n00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.350\noff from one after the other, but\nthey're still standing around.\n\n124\n00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.080\nSo when we talk about estimating\nthe idea of work effort, well,\n\n125\n00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.185\nthat's what we're talking about,\nis that is really does go into this.\n\n126\n00:06:47.185 --> 00:06:49.740\nWhen we need to actually have\nthat work breakdown structure,\n\n127\n00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.320\nwe need to actually be able\nto figure out whether or\n\n128\n00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.300\nnot we need additional resources,\nand we'll see that as well.\n\n129\n00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.500\nAnd then,\nhow many resources do we end up assigning?\n\n130\n00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.732\nSo if we don't know what the packages are,\nI can say well, Daniel,\n\n131\n00:07:01.732 --> 00:07:03.378\nhere is what a package is.\n\n132\n00:07:03.378 --> 00:07:04.965\nAnd Daniel looks and goes,\n\n133\n00:07:04.965 --> 00:07:09.390\nwhy do you have eight people assigned\nto this one work package here?\n\n134\n00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.790\nIt doesn't make sense.\n\n135\n00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.030\nWell, the reason why is that I have no\nidea what the breakdown of the work\n\n136\n00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.020\nis for that.\n\n137\n00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.200\nSo I just said it looked like\na good number that I could assign.\n\n138\n00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.290\nBut actually understanding what the work\nis when we talk about a work breakdown,\n\n139\n00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.680\nright, is actually assigning the work\nitself and ultimately creating the budget.\n\n140\n00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.090\nSo when we go back to the terminology,\nwork breakdown, well,\n\n141\n00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:31.490\nthat's what we're really talking about.\n\n142\n00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.760\nIs how do we take the actual\nwork that we need and\n\n143\n00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.350\nbeing actually put it into\nsome manageable form.\n\n144\n00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:44.011\nAnd that's what we talk about here\nas far as the overall benefits\n\n145\n00:07:44.011 --> 00:07:48.598\nthat we get when we have this\nwork breakdown structure, okay?\n\n146\n00:07:48.598 --> 00:07:53.778\nSo, it is really key that there's a couple\nof things that has to be done, okay?\n\n147\n00:07:53.778 --> 00:07:58.106\nFirst and foremost, right, we have that\nproject scope statement where we do have\n\n148\n00:07:58.106 --> 00:08:02.244\nA fairly high level overview, and then\nif we include this in there, we now have\n\n149\n00:08:02.244 --> 00:08:06.410\na little bit of a detailed overview as\nwell, but at the highest levels, okay?\n\n150\n00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.571\nNow notice what I have here,\nthe key element,\n\n151\n00:08:09.571 --> 00:08:13.641\nthe key benefit behind it,\nis what we call decomposition.\n\n152\n00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:16.363\nIt allows us to do what\nwe absolutely need to do.\n\n153\n00:08:16.363 --> 00:08:22.878\nWe take the scope and we now break it\ndown into manageable work elements.\n\n154\n00:08:22.878 --> 00:08:26.393\nOkay, or work chunks,\nwork components, whatever you want.\n\n155\n00:08:26.393 --> 00:08:28.742\nAnd this is something that\nis very difficult for\n\n156\n00:08:28.742 --> 00:08:32.692\nthe beginning project manager,\nthe novice project manager, to understand.\n\n157\n00:08:32.692 --> 00:08:37.570\nHe can take a look at the scope and\nsays, I think, I believe,\n\n158\n00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.701\nI absolutely 100% agree\nthat this can be done.\n\n159\n00:08:41.701 --> 00:08:46.255\nBut because of a lack of experience\na lot of times he doesn't know what\n\n160\n00:08:46.255 --> 00:08:50.193\nelements it actually breaks\ndown into to get that job done.\n\n161\n00:08:50.193 --> 00:08:52.048\nHe knows what needs to be done but\n\n162\n00:08:52.048 --> 00:08:55.020\nhe may not know how it\nactually breaks down to do so.\n\n163\n00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.480\nSo trying to figure this\nout is technically, and\n\n164\n00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.760\nthis is the word you want\nto center in on here,\n\n165\n00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.120\nis that term decomposition which\nis really just breaking it down.\n\n166\n00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.640\n>> Ronnie, is that what separates this,\nor distinguishes it,\n\n167\n00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.430\nmaybe should I say, from something like\nthe scope statement or even the charter?\n\n168\n00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.920\n>> Yes,\nremember that both of those, right,\n\n169\n00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.640\nat the actual scope statement level\nitself as well as at the charter level,\n\n170\n00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.310\nwe're really getting a bird's eye view\nof the entire project itself, okay?\n\n171\n00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:28.180\nNow when you start asking manufacturing or\ncreating that scope statement itself.\n\n172\n00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.350\nYou even come down to the work\nbreakdown structure to show that\n\n173\n00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:36.120\nyou have an understanding of what needs to\nbe managed in very general chunks here.\n\n174\n00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.890\nBut when you start breaking this down for\nactual planning, you really do,\n\n175\n00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:44.580\nyou're actually breaking it down into\nvery small and manageable chunks.\n\n176\n00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.760\nAnd this again is where the project\nmanager has to stand back for a moment and\n\n177\n00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:53.490\nnot say, I know I can accomplish\nthis in three hours, okay?\n\n178\n00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.880\nWhat he has to do is stand back and say,\nwhat level do I need to manage this at?\n\n179\n00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.120\nOr, at this point,\nwho do I need to get to manage it instead?\n\n180\n00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.660\nSo, the work breakdown structure is taking\nthat, it's taking the project scope and\n\n181\n00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:10.510\nsaying, what are the manageable\nchunks of work that need to be done,\n\n182\n00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:14.980\nand how do I actually manage that, or\nwho do I get to manage that for us?\n\n183\n00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.270\nAnd that's what we're talking about.\n\n184\n00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:19.780\nSo, you'll hear in the way that\nCompTIAt mentions this is,\n\n185\n00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.470\nit breaks down the scope\ndown to work components.\n\n186\n00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.555\nNow in the PMP world, right, the project\nmanagement professional world and so\n\n187\n00:10:27.555 --> 00:10:30.920\nI'm gonna say that you might\nsee both terms on the exam,\n\n188\n00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.060\nyou might hear instead\nthe term work package.\n\n189\n00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:38.020\nSo when you hear that,\nthat's what also happens here too.\n\n190\n00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.600\nIs that the work breakdown\ntakes the scope and\n\n191\n00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.380\nbreaks it down into\nindividual work packages.\n\n192\n00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.420\nThe work package itself\nis actually designed\n\n193\n00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.060\nto do a couple of things for us, right?\n\n194\n00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:52.850\nIt's a really a management term\nmore that anything else, okay?\n\n195\n00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.240\nIt allows us to be able to actually say,\n\n196\n00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:00.270\nhere's the amount of work we believe\nthat can be done in an estimated time.\n\n197\n00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:06.420\nSo if we say hey, it's gonna take Daniel\nand Ronnie, let's say, six hours to paint\n\n198\n00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:11.250\nthe entire house, or we'll say, we'll give\nthem a day to paint the entire house.\n\n199\n00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.940\nWell, then we're saying that\nthat's a manageable amount of time\n\n200\n00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.870\nthat we can say with some assurance and\nsome assumptions that Daniel and\n\n201\n00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.750\nRonnie can paint the house in a day, okay.\n\n202\n00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.530\nNow I don't know who would ever actually\nassign me to do something like that.\n\n203\n00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:27.470\nBut overall though, we can say that.\n\n204\n00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.820\nAnd that's what we're assuming here\nin the idea of the work package,\n\n205\n00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:34.240\nis that we know what that full\namount of work is gonna be.\n\n206\n00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.840\nSecondly, now that we have that idea,\nwe now know what resources\n\n207\n00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.750\ncan be assigned and how much cost we\ncan associate with that amount of work.\n\n208\n00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.060\nSo it's not just that we go, okay,\nhere's work that needs to be done.\n\n209\n00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.350\nAnd then we go, I hope we can finish it.\n\n210\n00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:54.410\nWe actually need to have, at least the\nproject manager needs to have some idea\n\n211\n00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:58.260\nthat here's the amount of\nwork that needs to be done.\n\n212\n00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.714\nI know Daniel, he's a great manager, and\n\n213\n00:12:00.714 --> 00:12:05.420\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna actually\nallow him to actually tell me essentially\n\n214\n00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.777\nhow much work needs to be done and\nhow many people he needs.\n\n215\n00:12:08.777 --> 00:12:12.960\nAnd then he's gonna turn that into me and\nI'm just gonna allow him to manage it.\n\n216\n00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.140\nSo, we need to actually at least have that\nidea of what is considered manageable.\n\n217\n00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.550\nSo essentially it actually\ntakes the project scope and\n\n218\n00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.730\nessentially gives us\nthe details behind it.\n\n219\n00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.020\nAnd this is something that we\nreally do end up using for\n\n220\n00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.880\nthe rest of the planning stage.\n\n221\n00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.350\nSo when we take a look at the explanation\nand the purpose of the actual scope,\n\n222\n00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.350\nwe also end up seeing the benefits too.\n\n223\n00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:39.860\n>> Awesome, well, Ronnie, that I guess\nleads us to, as we can see with the WBS,\n\n224\n00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.140\nwhat we're doing is we're\nstarting to define things.\n\n225\n00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.910\nWe're starting to put clear lines\nof demarcation on certain things.\n\n226\n00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.550\nAnd that's kind of where\nwe have to move to next,\n\n227\n00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:52.900\nwhere there's other parts of the WBS\nthat are going to be defined.\n\n228\n00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:57.454\n>> Yep, we really are gonna end up seeing\nthis, that by its result, once we break\n\n229\n00:12:57.454 --> 00:13:02.087\nthis down, it's not only gonna tell us\nthe amount of work that needs to be done.\n\n230\n00:13:02.087 --> 00:13:07.015\nBut it's really gonna help us clearly\ndefine those kind of intangible areas when\n\n231\n00:13:07.015 --> 00:13:08.910\nwe made that scope statement.\n\n232\n00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.920\nSo it's gonna give us some certain\nboundaries that we're gonna\n\n233\n00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.750\nend up seeing here when we\nstart to actually do it.\n\n234\n00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:18.130\nAnd that way we can actually\nclearly delineate in our work what\n\n235\n00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:23.180\nis a part of the scope and what isn't a\npart of the scope, down to the work level.\n\n236\n00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:28.040\nVery easy to, again, with just a single\nparagraph or even a paper, right?\n\n237\n00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:32.160\nTo rub that gray area between what\nthe scope boundary actually is\n\n238\n00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.250\nand what it isn't.\n\n239\n00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.010\nBut when you can break down the entire\nscope into manageable work,\n\n240\n00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.520\nwell that clearly says, hey, what you're\ntelling me is that this needs to be done.\n\n241\n00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:47.020\nBut it didn't fit anywhere in any of\nthe work packages that I created.\n\n242\n00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.550\nOr that needs to be done, so clearly,\nit could be outside of the scope.\n\n243\n00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.750\nSo it really does help us to set\nthat up when we start seeing it.\n\n244\n00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.700\n>> So, Ronnie,\nyou mentioned the work level.\n\n245\n00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.835\nThere are obviously\nsome levels to the WBS.\n\n246\n00:13:59.835 --> 00:14:00.536\nCan you explain or\n\n247\n00:14:00.536 --> 00:14:03.420\nwalk us through what we might\ncommonly see when it comes to levels?\n\n248\n00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.772\n>> Absolutely, so that's what we wanna do\nis we wanna take a look at this breakdown\n\n249\n00:14:06.772 --> 00:14:10.174\nbecause it's gonna be essential not only\nas you're preparing for the exam, but\n\n250\n00:14:10.174 --> 00:14:12.040\nalso when you end up\nworking with a company.\n\n251\n00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.500\nAnd remember that every\ncompany will be different.\n\n252\n00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.900\nThey might describe it\na little bit different.\n\n253\n00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.910\nI 'm trying to use the most generic\nterms I can, and also, of course,\n\n254\n00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.120\nprepare you for the exam.\n\n255\n00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.820\nSo let's take a look at some of\nthe different levels of using the WBS and\n\n256\n00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.120\nhow this tends to work out.\n\n257\n00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.920\nLet me go ahead and just zoom in just\na little bit here, at this top level one,\n\n258\n00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.840\nif I can.\n\n259\n00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.780\nThat way we can see it\na little bit better.\n\n260\n00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:37.140\nSo when we take a look then,\nit's really an outline format, right?\n\n261\n00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.360\nIf we've been in any type of school, we've\nlearned how to create an outline where we\n\n262\n00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.390\nmake a major point and then of course,\nsupporting points, and then\n\n263\n00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:47.440\nunder each of those points there normally\nis going to be supporting points as well.\n\n264\n00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.240\nSo when it comes down to it,\nat the very beginning,\n\n265\n00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.720\nwhen we take a look at\nthe actual project itself,\n\n266\n00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:59.720\nthat is our top level of our WBS,\nour work breakdown structure.\n\n267\n00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.563\nHere is what we say is\ngoing to be accomplished.\n\n268\n00:15:02.563 --> 00:15:04.950\nHere is our overall goal.\n\n269\n00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:10.265\nNow, you then take that project and\nyou break it down into sublevels.\n\n270\n00:15:10.265 --> 00:15:11.990\nNow what are those sublevels about?\n\n271\n00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:14.520\nThey're about things like deliverables,\nand\n\n272\n00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.540\nmaybe even subprojects\nthat go on after that.\n\n273\n00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.010\nSo let's kind of give you an example.\n\n274\n00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.430\nAbout three or\n\n275\n00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:24.100\nfour, I'm gonna say three years ago now,\nabout three years ago now I was actually\n\n276\n00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:29.260\nworking on a project where what we did\nis we migrated everybody in the office\n\n277\n00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:34.020\nfrom using standalone workstations in\na domain environment, don't get me wrong.\n\n278\n00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:34.940\nAnd then we said look,\n\n279\n00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:39.260\nwe need to move them into a thin\nclient work environment instead.\n\n280\n00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.592\nSo what had to happen there is that we had\nto come up with a project on the equipment\n\n281\n00:15:43.592 --> 00:15:44.756\nthat we would need and\n\n282\n00:15:44.756 --> 00:15:47.878\nany of the infrastructure that\nwould have to be changed.\n\n283\n00:15:47.878 --> 00:15:51.644\nAnd, of course, then how do we actually\nget it implemented and tested and\n\n284\n00:15:51.644 --> 00:15:54.458\nverified that it all works in\nthe way that we want it to?\n\n285\n00:15:54.458 --> 00:15:56.948\nSo we had to do something\nlike that as well.\n\n286\n00:15:56.948 --> 00:16:02.408\nSo for us, when we start taking a look\nat it, we knew what the top level was,\n\n287\n00:16:02.408 --> 00:16:07.670\nwhich was migrating those users\nover into the thin client model.\n\n288\n00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:12.040\nBut then we had to break it down into\nwhat we talked about, major deliverables.\n\n289\n00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.980\nMaybe we might say, look,\nwe're gonna concentrate on hardware,\n\n290\n00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.570\nwe're then gonna concentrate then on\ntesting, and then we're gonna concentrate\n\n291\n00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.730\non making sure that the user\nprofiles are migrating over.\n\n292\n00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.020\nWhatever it might be you would\nactually end up doing that.\n\n293\n00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.210\nAnd so those might be your\nfirst two levels there,\n\n294\n00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.260\nright, the top level and\nthe first sublevel.\n\n295\n00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.580\nNow if I just said hardware,\n\n296\n00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.250\nwell that's kind of that sublevel,\nthat's a deliverable.\n\n297\n00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:35.880\nYou know you're gonna get hardware, right?\n\n298\n00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.820\nWe're talking about that we actually\nadded in a couple of servers And 50 or\n\n299\n00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.040\n60 thin classes is what we ended up doing.\n\n300\n00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.590\nBut then we can even break that down\n\n301\n00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.700\na little bit more into\nmanageable work units.\n\n302\n00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:52.780\nWho's gonna actually install the solver,\nthe server, excuse me, and on what day?\n\n303\n00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.900\nWe can even go ahead and say, look since\nwe're gonna get all the equipment at one\n\n304\n00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.200\ntime, I'm let Daniel go ahead and\n\n305\n00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:02.080\nstart setting up and\nputting out all of the thin clients and\n\n306\n00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.770\nmaking sure the hardware's there and\navailable to switch over when we need to.\n\n307\n00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:10.570\nSo it may even be different sublevels and\nI actually even put in a little bit grey\n\n308\n00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:14.190\nhere because you can break it\ndown as far as you want to.\n\n309\n00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:15.100\nBut there comes a point,\n\n310\n00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.650\nespecially when you're a novice project\nmanager, that you go too far, okay.\n\n311\n00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:22.140\nAnd by going too far that means\nyou start micromanaging and\n\n312\n00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.430\nthat's not what you wanna do What\nyou want is you want this break\n\n313\n00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:29.030\ndown to happen to where you're sitting and\ngo look, it comes out to it.\n\n314\n00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.310\nAnd the second sub level right here, okay?\n\n315\n00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:35.780\nAt the very second sub level,\nthat is our manageable unit.\n\n316\n00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:42.010\nI'm getting Daniel to go ahead and to put\nin place all of those did the tolerance.\n\n317\n00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:42.530\nOkay?\n\n318\n00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:43.890\nThat's the manageable one.\n\n319\n00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:44.400\nOkay?\n\n320\n00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.110\nSo at that point I go Daniel,\nyou're gonna manage that, and\n\n321\n00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.580\nDaniel says no problem\nI can take care of it.\n\n322\n00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:53.140\nSo now that becomes that manageable\nunit and that is the key.\n\n323\n00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:57.270\nNotice that whatever level you stop,\nit's not about trying to get like\n\n324\n00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:02.590\nis Daniel going to plug in, you know,\nstep one, plug in the power cord.\n\n325\n00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:03.750\nTo the thin client.\n\n326\n00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.570\nYou know that's beyond micromanagement and\nthen going that way.\n\n327\n00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:11.420\nStep two, he's gonna plug in the USB\ncable for the keyboard and the mouse.\n\n328\n00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.600\nThat's too micromanagement, but\ncan we break it down that way?\n\n329\n00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.920\nSure, you can go down to\nthe smallest detail if you want to.\n\n330\n00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.850\nBut when you're a project manager you're\njust looking at manageable units here.\n\n331\n00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:25.100\nSo you really just need to\nbreak it down into this right?\n\n332\n00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.520\nThe lowest level that you really need\nis what we call that Work Package, and\n\n333\n00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.080\nthat should be what it is,\nis that you say here's my Work Package.\n\n334\n00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.320\nSo you may stop at that second level,\nand you kinda draw a box, and\n\n335\n00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.090\nthen you assign a number to it.\n\n336\n00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:43.040\nAnd this numbering system can either\nbe assigned in a couple of ways\n\n337\n00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.280\nOne if you're on your own.\n\n338\n00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.230\nOkay.\nYou can make up your own numbering system\n\n339\n00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:47.160\nhowever you want to.\n\n340\n00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.620\nSo that works.\n\n341\n00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:53.040\nBut normally though if you're working in\na large enough project environment, right,\n\n342\n00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.740\nwhere there might be a PMO,\na project management office.\n\n343\n00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.590\nYou might see because your project\nactually has an internal number\n\n344\n00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:04.480\nthat they may have assigned that here's\nwhat your project is actually gonna use as\n\n345\n00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.050\nfar as these numbers go.\n\n346\n00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:11.260\nSo you might find out that you're\nactually 32.1 at the actual first level.\n\n347\n00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:14.260\nAnd then,\nyour 1st Sub Level might be 32.1.1.\n\n348\n00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.260\nAnd then your 2nd might be 32.1.1.1.\n\n349\n00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:21.290\nYou just end up seeing what\nthe breakdown is at that point.\n\n350\n00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:22.230\nBut what you're trying to do,\n\n351\n00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:26.110\nyou're trying to turn in what you\nbelieve are manageable units, okay.\n\n352\n00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:29.460\nSo, when we talk down about technically\n\n353\n00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:34.700\nwhat this work break down packages at\nthe work break down structure level here.\n\n354\n00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:39.120\nThere's two different ways that\nwe can take a look at this idea.\n\n355\n00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.340\nFrom the management side and\nthis is what you want to know.\n\n356\n00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:42.910\nRight?\n\n357\n00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:47.110\nFrom the management side, the project\nmanagement side it's about the idea here\n\n358\n00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:52.670\nof being able to address or\nmanage Resources and cost estimates, okay.\n\n359\n00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:56.100\nSo when you take a look at it from that\nmanagerial side, that's all it's about.\n\n360\n00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.920\nOkay, i wanna break it down\nto the point where I can say,\n\n361\n00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.100\nDaniel told me it's gonna take\ntwo people to work on this.\n\n362\n00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.290\nHe's gonna work on it.\n\n363\n00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.470\nHe also told me that it's gonna take,\nlet's say two days to get everything laid\n\n364\n00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.140\nout the way that we want to and\nto get connected.\n\n365\n00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:14.160\nLet's say he actually works out the hourly\nrate and he gives me what the figures are.\n\n366\n00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.750\nThen I trust that as\nbeing my work package.\n\n367\n00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:19.290\nOkay, well that's all I\nneed as a project manager.\n\n368\n00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:23.160\nI'm not going in there and say Daniel,\ntell me everything that's actually\n\n369\n00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.720\ninvolved here and\ngive me the nitty gritty details.\n\n370\n00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.210\nDaniel is saying here's\nwhat needs to be done.\n\n371\n00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:31.330\nI take that as a figure and\nI now can use in other planning, and\n\n372\n00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:32.960\npart of this work breakdown.\n\n373\n00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.540\nSo I can now start scheduling the work.\n\n374\n00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:40.510\nThe other thing though, is when you look\nat it from, of course then Daniel's point,\n\n375\n00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:44.800\nif he is actually one of the managers or\none of the people I trust to do the work.\n\n376\n00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.580\nAt this point, right.\n\n377\n00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.890\nAt a task level Daniel now actually\ncan break it down and say,\n\n378\n00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:55.250\nhere's who I'm gonna assign to the task\nto accomplish the activity and\n\n379\n00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:57.730\nhere's how much it's gonna\nactually really take.\n\n380\n00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.350\nSo he may actually be just\nwatching it if I tell him,\n\n381\n00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:04.240\nlook you take those two days but\njust make sure nobody gets overtime.\n\n382\n00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.460\nWell then he knows what I'm\nactually worried about.\n\n383\n00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.960\nDaniel knows how to actually do the work.\n\n384\n00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:12.320\nI'm not telling him, make sure you\ndon't allow gym to get overtime,\n\n385\n00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.060\nmake sure you don't allow so and so.\n\n386\n00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.130\nHe does what he needs to.\n\n387\n00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:18.720\nI already told him what the management\nis and that what I'm concerned about.\n\n388\n00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.880\nAnd so we do break it down to that\nparticular point where we say,\n\n389\n00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.250\nhere's what we believe can be managed.\n\n390\n00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.770\nOnce again very difficult for what,\n\n391\n00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.800\nthe novice project manager,\nbecause what does he wanna do?\n\n392\n00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.520\nHe wants to actually make sure that he\naccounts for everything and then he has to\n\n393\n00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.480\ncount back up and actually say all right,\nso now I know what every detail is.\n\n394\n00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.880\nAnd don't get me wrong,\nsome projects you will have to do that so\n\n395\n00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.750\nyou understand, but the majority of times\nright, if you're experienced at it.\n\n396\n00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:48.280\nYou trust the actual people that\nyou're actually giving the duty to.\n\n397\n00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.250\nAnd you just trusting that they're\ngiving you the right numbers.\n\n398\n00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:54.440\nIf they don't, you go back to them and go\nhey, I need a better estimate than that.\n\n399\n00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.560\nIf Daniel says, we can get it done\nsometime this week, then I'm gonna say,\n\n400\n00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.850\nthat's just not good enough.\n\n401\n00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:00.570\n>> It's too big.\n\n402\n00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.180\n>> Too big, okay?\n\n403\n00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:05.010\nThat's where you might actually go,\nall right, the work breakdown package\n\n404\n00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:09.990\nobviously, is not broken down enough\nto where Daniel thinks it's manageable.\n\n405\n00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:13.060\nBecause Daniel now is looking at it like,\nI know how to do this part of it,\n\n406\n00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.950\ndon't know how to do this part.\n\n407\n00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.570\nSo it might be where you\nhave to take a look again.\n\n408\n00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:20.710\nBut just kind of remember that at the\nlowest level that is your work package or\n\n409\n00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:24.020\nyour work component that you\nneed to break it down into.\n\n410\n00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:27.120\nAnd that's what you're going to focus in\non when we start talking about the idea\n\n411\n00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.770\nhere of doing work for our project.\n\n412\n00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:35.030\nSo you can see those levels\nin place to do that.\n\n413\n00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:36.950\nNow, you go, okay, Ronnie,\n\n414\n00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:40.180\nthat sounds great, but what the-\n>> You did a great job of describing\n\n415\n00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.370\nwhat a WBS is.\n\n416\n00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:42.240\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n417\n00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.960\n>> Now I guess the question would be,\nand I think, Ronnie,\n\n418\n00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.250\nI'm trying to see if I can\nsee where he's heading here.\n\n419\n00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:49.150\nHow do we utilize this?\n\n420\n00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:51.010\n>> Yup.\n>> How do we make this work for\n\n421\n00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:53.490\nus in an actual project\nplanning environment?\n\n422\n00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:56.690\n>> Yeah, that's what we wanna take\na look at least briefly here.\n\n423\n00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.720\nLet me see if I can zoom in and\nout a little bit.\n\n424\n00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.750\nSo, what you normally see might be\nsomething that looks similar to this.\n\n425\n00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:05.550\nI'm not gonna tell you it's exactly\nbecause everybody does it a little bit\n\n426\n00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:06.680\ndifferently and\n\n427\n00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:11.290\ndifferent software breaks down these word\npackages a little bit differently as well.\n\n428\n00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:15.350\nSo what happen is that you set up some\ntype of graphical way that you are wanna\n\n429\n00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:21.110\nexplain to anybody that walks by of what\nis going to has occur in your project.\n\n430\n00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.020\nSo you might see something like\nthis hang up on the wall or\n\n431\n00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.460\nyou might see it in the form of software.\n\n432\n00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:29.170\nDuring meeting you'll see it of course\nas hand outs as you have this done.\n\n433\n00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:32.010\nSo let's take for an example\nthe project that I mentioned here.\n\n434\n00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.710\nOkay, here it is.\n\n435\n00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:36.770\nMy project was migrating\nusers to thin clients,\n\n436\n00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:40.630\nthat was the ultimate goal on the project\nto move people that were on regular\n\n437\n00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:43.850\ndesktop computers over\nto those thin clients.\n\n438\n00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:49.717\nSo at this point I assign myself a number,\n1.0, why?\n\n439\n00:23:49.717 --> 00:23:52.698\nBecause we didn't have any real\nstructure that we had to follow.\n\n440\n00:23:52.698 --> 00:23:55.588\nSo, I'm actually saying that\nthis is one project for me.\n\n441\n00:23:55.588 --> 00:24:01.180\nAnd in this one project that is\nmy top level, WBS here, okay?\n\n442\n00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.900\nSo that is the overall project itself.\n\n443\n00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.690\nI break down now what I believe\nneeds to be accomplished in the most\n\n444\n00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:11.350\nmajor accomplishments that I\ncan as far as deliverables go.\n\n445\n00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:14.600\nAnd I told you about the idea\nof installing hardware.\n\n446\n00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.410\nNotice that I started off with one but\nhere is my second level and\n\n447\n00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.870\nthis is normally how you see\nit displayed is using decimal.\n\n448\n00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:24.040\nNow sometimes you might see dashes.\n\n449\n00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.190\nYou can change this in\nsystems that you want to.\n\n450\n00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:31.290\nIf you do it in software you might have to\nmanually create your own numbering system\n\n451\n00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:34.630\nwhich can be a little bit challenging at\ntimes when you use something like this.\n\n452\n00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:38.760\nBut overall though you see where it says\n1.1, and then I had system testing and\n\n453\n00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.460\nit continuous on and on,\nI just didn't draw the rest of it.\n\n454\n00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.280\nBut I could have broken each and\none of those down about what I meant for\n\n455\n00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.830\nsystem testing and\nall the owners that I add in there.\n\n456\n00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:50.580\nAnd notice at the third level, notice\nthat there's actually three numbers,\n\n457\n00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.790\nlet me zoom in and make sure that we\ncould see that just a little bit more.\n\n458\n00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.490\nSo you can actually see now,\n\n459\n00:24:55.490 --> 00:25:00.780\nthe three numbers right there, it started\nwith servers going in to the racks,\n\n460\n00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:05.780\nwiring installation for the building,\nsetting up the end-user thin clients here,\n\n461\n00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:10.600\nand of course the actual setup\nof monitors, keyboard, and mice.\n\n462\n00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.850\nI could have broken it down in that\nparticular situation as far as work\n\n463\n00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:15.300\npackages go.\n\n464\n00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.930\nAnd now, those are now manageable for us.\n\n465\n00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.926\nSo when somebody says,\nor when Daniel says,\n\n466\n00:25:19.926 --> 00:25:21.720\nwell what am I supposed to be working on?\n\n467\n00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.560\nI'm gonna say, well which work\npackage were you assigned to?\n\n468\n00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.510\nAnd that way we can actually do that.\n\n469\n00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.242\nAnd Daniel can actually look and\n\n470\n00:25:28.242 --> 00:25:32.490\ngo, yeah, I'm suppose to be\nworking on 1.1.4 right now, yeah.\n\n471\n00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:34.825\nI spent a couple days where\nI didn't do anything.\n\n472\n00:25:34.825 --> 00:25:37.810\nSo, we update that and\nwe do whatever we need to.\n\n473\n00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:41.200\nBut this is really essential when you\ndo need that graphic way of being able\n\n474\n00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:45.680\nto display the information that\nwe tend to have in our scope.\n\n475\n00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.900\nAnd this is also great in\nmeetings because it does.\n\n476\n00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.660\nGiving somebody a paper to read,\npeople like that.\n\n477\n00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:55.170\nBut you show them visually that hey,\nhere's what we've accomplished and\n\n478\n00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:58.550\nyou start marking these things off and\nwhat we aren't accomplishing yet.\n\n479\n00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:02.352\nThey can kind of visually see, hey,\nhow far are you actually progressing and\n\n480\n00:26:02.352 --> 00:26:05.042\nthere's a lot more detail\nthat we can go into this but,\n\n481\n00:26:05.042 --> 00:26:08.875\nat least at the WBS structure, this is\nwhat we're normally taking a look at.\n\n482\n00:26:08.875 --> 00:26:13.790\n>> And this also gives us the opportunity\nto give a good critique of our WBS.\n\n483\n00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:16.360\nMaybe we've made some mistakes here and\nthere.\n\n484\n00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:21.770\nHaving that good visual reference is gonna\ngive us a great place to go you know what?\n\n485\n00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.420\nI need to merge these two things together.\n\n486\n00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.070\nOr I need to separate\nthese two things out.\n\n487\n00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.180\nAnd it really does a great job of that for\nus as well.\n\n488\n00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.940\n>> It really does and\nthat's exactly what you're doing right?\n\n489\n00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.420\nWhen you take a look at this,\nwhen you take a look at where you are, and\n\n490\n00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.730\nthere's a lot of times where you're\nbrought into the middle of a project and\n\n491\n00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:38.780\nyou just don't know.\n\n492\n00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:42.100\nAnd now what you do is you take a look\nat the work breakdown structure and\n\n493\n00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.300\nyou start seeing how the actual\nwork packages were assigned.\n\n494\n00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.810\nAnd what they were doing,\nit really is something like this.\n\n495\n00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:50.850\nBut you normally see in the work breakdown\nstructure, if you're critiquing it.\n\n496\n00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.030\nYou normally see a numbering system, okay.\n\n497\n00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.080\nYou normally see the top level.\n\n498\n00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.970\nYou normally see multiple levels at times.\n\n499\n00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:02.020\nBut remember, whatever that last level is,\nthat's what the project manager,\n\n500\n00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:06.210\nand whoever's helping them to create\nthis believes is what is the work\n\n501\n00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:11.170\npackage itself in order to manage\na unit of work that has to be done.\n\n502\n00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:15.190\nIt's not trying to micromanage, it's just\nsaying that here's what we believe here\n\n503\n00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:18.200\nis here's that manageable unit of work.\n\n504\n00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:22.870\nNormally if you wanna take that\ndown to real time estimates,\n\n505\n00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:24.400\nit's usually about a day's work.\n\n506\n00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.420\nA day worth of work, and\nin project management,\n\n507\n00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.240\nyou tend to equal that\nout to about eight hours.\n\n508\n00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.510\nNow not every day is always\neight hours of work,\n\n509\n00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:34.640\nbut that's the assumption\nthat you're making.\n\n510\n00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:38.950\nAnd it's a general assumption because\nnormally workdays are eight hours long and\n\n511\n00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:41.540\nyou accomplish just so\nmuch during that time.\n\n512\n00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.600\nSo usually if you need a rule of thumb,\nright?\n\n513\n00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.950\nIf you go, work breakdown structure?\n\n514\n00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:49.750\nI still have to manage it, but\nI'm not gonna take the time to do this.\n\n515\n00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:53.350\nWhat you wanna do is you wanna breakdown\nthe work to what's normally managed within\n\n516\n00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:54.660\nabout a day's time.\n\n517\n00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.680\nSo what are you gonna accomplish in a day?\n\n518\n00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:00.080\nSo even though I talked about installing\nhardware, I could do it all in a day, but\n\n519\n00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.220\nthe very fact is I don't know how\nmuch hardware needed installed.\n\n520\n00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.760\nI don't know how detailed it actually\ngets into installing servers and\n\n521\n00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.420\nserver racks, well I may not know\nif I can accomplish that in a day.\n\n522\n00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.150\nSo I might break that down and go no.\n\n523\n00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:13.830\nI'm gonna say that I'm gonna\ngive the servers a day.\n\n524\n00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:15.585\nAnd you can kind of use\nthat as a guideline or\n\n525\n00:28:15.585 --> 00:28:18.610\na rule of thumb to kind\nof help you out there.\n\n526\n00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:20.120\nSo that's where that breaks down.\n\n527\n00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:23.350\nNow remember it doesn't mean\nthat you have to follow us.\n\n528\n00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:24.300\nWhat are we trying to do here?\n\n529\n00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.210\nRemember we're trying to actually give you\nthe best practices That you'll generally\n\n530\n00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:31.030\nfind by most project managers,\nas well as getting ready for the exam.\n\n531\n00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:35.970\nBut in the end, PMI, right, the Project\nManagement Institute, the guys at CompTIA\n\n532\n00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:39.520\ndon't sit there and go, you have to\ndo your project management this way.\n\n533\n00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.600\nYou have to make sure that you do it all.\n\n534\n00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.790\nYou can do it however you want to.\n\n535\n00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:46.270\nBut they're saying, here's normally\nwhat most project managers would end up\n\n536\n00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:49.280\nbreaking it down into, and\nthat's pretty much the key.\n\n537\n00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.400\n>> Awesome stuff, Ronnie.\n\n538\n00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:51.880\nNow, we've talked a lot about WBS,\n\n539\n00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.780\nis there anything else that we need\nto cover, in this episode at least?\n\n540\n00:28:55.780 --> 00:29:01.065\nI know this probably, we can probably make\n12 episodes of WBS and bore you to tears.\n\n541\n00:29:01.065 --> 00:29:02.835\nBut pertinent information,\nanything else for\n\n542\n00:29:02.835 --> 00:29:04.195\nthis episode that we need to talk about?\n\n543\n00:29:04.195 --> 00:29:06.465\n>> There's only one other thing\nthat we really need to get in here,\n\n544\n00:29:06.465 --> 00:29:09.885\nwhich is what we call the WBS Dictionary.\n\n545\n00:29:09.885 --> 00:29:14.605\nNow this is really more of a technical\nside for us as we are getting ready for\n\n546\n00:29:14.605 --> 00:29:15.245\nthe exam.\n\n547\n00:29:15.245 --> 00:29:20.530\nAnd this does happen to more formalized\nproject management situations here,\n\n548\n00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:23.640\nbut we normally need to create something\nlike this because remember where your\n\n549\n00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.480\nproject team maybe coming from.\n\n550\n00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.487\nAnd you're saying, well where the heck\nis my project team coming from,\n\n551\n00:29:28.487 --> 00:29:29.670\nexactly, okay?\n\n552\n00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:30.820\nYou don't know, okay?\n\n553\n00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.500\nSo that's the key.\n\n554\n00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:36.660\nSo what has to happen is that\nif you want somebody to try and\n\n555\n00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.860\nfully understand the way you\ncreated a work breakdown structure,\n\n556\n00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.380\nyou need a dictionary about\nyour work breakdown structure.\n\n557\n00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:46.130\nIn other words, to actually let them\nunderstand the terms that you're using,\n\n558\n00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:47.790\ncuz it may not actually be working for\nthem.\n\n559\n00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:50.290\nThey might go,\nI don't know what that means or,\n\n560\n00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.100\nthat's not the way that I did\nit in my last organization.\n\n561\n00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:57.710\nSo the idea of the work breakdown\nstructure dictionary, the WBS Dictionary,\n\n562\n00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:02.220\nit goes ahead and it begins to formal\ndocumentation of that work level.\n\n563\n00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.300\nIn other words,\nit shows us that WBS structure and\n\n564\n00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:10.060\nthen it gives us descriptions of\nthe actual work packages themselves.\n\n565\n00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:14.690\nNow normally it also includes a lot\nof these other things that we see.\n\n566\n00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:18.230\nWhich is, how do we know that we're\nactually accomplishing what we need to?\n\n567\n00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:21.030\nSo we have a list of every single\ndeliverable that we believe that's gonna\n\n568\n00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.670\nbe accomplished during our project.\n\n569\n00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.260\nAnd that way,\nwe know that we're actually on track.\n\n570\n00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:28.400\nIt gives us that code\nthat we're talking about.\n\n571\n00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:35.344\nSo, if somebody's wondering,\nwhat the heck is 4.1.2.3?\n\n572\n00:30:35.344 --> 00:30:39.268\nIt actually explains\nhow that code is there.\n\n573\n00:30:39.268 --> 00:30:42.810\nA lot of times it is about\naccounting more than anything else.\n\n574\n00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:46.950\nWhen you turn in your work, and you\nhave that Project Management Accountant,\n\n575\n00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:48.690\nhe's not gonna know well,\nwhere does this fit in?\n\n576\n00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:52.520\nHe wants that code that says hey, here's\nwhere they actually bought the material,\n\n577\n00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.810\nand here's where it actually goes into.\n\n578\n00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:55.500\nAnd that way they can judge whether or\n\n579\n00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.820\nnot you've been over budget, under budget,\ndid what you needed to or not.\n\n580\n00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.900\nWho's responsible for the work,\nthe actual resources, estimates,\n\n581\n00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.990\nacceptance criteria, you name it.\n\n582\n00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:08.520\nBut remember that it's actually\nused as a reference so\n\n583\n00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:11.497\nthat everybody can understand\nthat work breakdown structure.\n\n584\n00:31:11.497 --> 00:31:14.414\nAnd you might go, well,\nhow important is this?\n\n585\n00:31:14.414 --> 00:31:16.230\nIt's insanely important, okay?\n\n586\n00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:17.447\nWhen it comes down to it.\n\n587\n00:31:17.447 --> 00:31:20.136\nIf I start to talk, and\nDaniel thinks he's talking, that I'm\n\n588\n00:31:20.136 --> 00:31:23.940\ntalking about the same thing he is, and\nthen Daniel starts describing them.\n\n589\n00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.230\nI don't know what you're talking about,\nDaniel.\n\n590\n00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.180\nWell then we're on a different page.\n\n591\n00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.440\nAnd Daniel may be working on\na totally different project,\n\n592\n00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.070\neven though he thinks he's working\non the same project as I am.\n\n593\n00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:33.250\nNot a good feeling to have.\n\n594\n00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:36.371\n>> Yeah, I've actually had\nthat happen in practicality,\n\n595\n00:31:36.371 --> 00:31:39.816\nmaybe not on a grand scale, but\nthe boss told me, he always says\n\n596\n00:31:39.816 --> 00:31:44.317\nI want you to delete a user because they\nwere, they left the company or something.\n\n597\n00:31:44.317 --> 00:31:47.706\nBut don't delete them from exchange.\n\n598\n00:31:47.706 --> 00:31:48.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He said delete them\n\n599\n00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:51.420\nfrom Active Directory but\ndon't delete them from exchange.\n\n600\n00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:53.590\nWell I have an exchange\nserver as our email server.\n\n601\n00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.584\nYou have Active Directory server\nobviously that holds all the users, and\n\n602\n00:31:56.584 --> 00:31:57.360\nthat's strange.\n\n603\n00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:02.450\nOkay so, you want me to keep their mail\nbox around but not their user account,\n\n604\n00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:04.250\nno problem, so I did that.\n\n605\n00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:07.020\nThen one day he calls me up and\nsays why didn't you delete this user?\n\n606\n00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:10.670\nI said I did, your email right here\nsays delete it from Active Directory and\n\n607\n00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:11.640\nnot Exchange.\n\n608\n00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:17.810\nHe said what I meant was don't do the\ndeletion from the Active Directory server,\n\n609\n00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:19.580\ndo it from the Exchange server.\n\n610\n00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.390\n>> Yes.\n>> Which would remove the account as well.\n\n611\n00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:27.450\nSo, as you can see, we weren't\njiving on what our terms were and\n\n612\n00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:29.960\nthen there was a disconnect and\nthe work didn't get done.\n\n613\n00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:34.870\nSo having a consistent terminology\nthat we can all look back to,\n\n614\n00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:36.380\nvery, very important.\n\n615\n00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.320\n>> And that dictionary being open and\navailable for\n\n616\n00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.860\neveryone will actually allow Daniel to\nknow that I didn't just change it at\n\n617\n00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.990\nthe moment cuz Daniel can say, no you\nchanged what you actually said to me now.\n\n618\n00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:47.480\nWell going back to that dictionary,\n\n619\n00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.020\nright, when we start working\non the entire project\n\n620\n00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:54.210\nanybody should be able to access that\ndictionary to understand what's going on.\n\n621\n00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:57.250\nAnd if they can't that's when they\nactually need more clarification.\n\n622\n00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.380\nBut that's why we have the dictionary,\nit's so\n\n623\n00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:03.740\nthat we won't need that and everybody\nwill understand what I mean when I say,\n\n624\n00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.350\nwhy aren't you doing your work package?\n\n625\n00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:08.550\nGenerally it's like,\nwell that's not my work package.\n\n626\n00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:11.820\nOr that's not what I understand by\na work package, whatever it might be.\n\n627\n00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:15.190\nSo it's very clear that this is actually\none of the key elements that will\n\n628\n00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:20.300\nreally help us out when we start talking\nabout the beginnings of management, right?\n\n629\n00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:25.090\nOf being able to manage the entire plan\nof the entire scope of the project.\n\n630\n00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:27.810\nThis is, by far, one of the most\nimportant elements we'll ever cover.\n\n631\n00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:28.810\n>> Totally agreed, Ronnie.\n\n632\n00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:32.220\nAnd excellent job in explaining this,\nand why it's so important.\n\n633\n00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:35.830\nNow hopefully, you guys are seeing it,\nthat this is going to help us\n\n634\n00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:40.170\nbe kind of our guiding star as we go\nthrough the project planning, and\n\n635\n00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:41.640\neven the project itself.\n\n636\n00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.040\nRonnie thank you so much for joining\nus today, we appreciate your wisdom and\n\n637\n00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:49.120\nknowledge to help us be better\nprepared for our Project + exam and\n\n638\n00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.670\nfor our projects in real life.\n\n639\n00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:54.351\nThat being said, we thank you guys for\njoining us, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n640\n00:33:54.351 --> 00:33:55.456\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n641\n00:33:55.456 --> 00:33:56.651\nI've been your hose Daniel Lowrie.\n\n642\n00:33:56.651 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:20.000\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode well,\n\n4\n00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.550\nwe are continuing with\nour Project+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.480\nJoining back in the studio again\ntoday is our mentor, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.780\nRonnie, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n7\n00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.876\n>> Well, thank you for having me back on\nthe show as we continue to take a look at\n\n8\n00:00:31.876 --> 00:00:33.643\nmore of the CompTIA Project+.\n\n9\n00:00:33.643 --> 00:00:37.765\nWe've already gone through quite a bit of\ninformation when we started this series\n\n10\n00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:40.464\nand we took a look at the idea\nof the pre project setup.\n\n11\n00:00:40.464 --> 00:00:43.243\nWe're now actually moving into, of course,\n\n12\n00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:47.670\nthe planning phase of the idea project\nmanagement and where we are today.\n\n13\n00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.640\nAs we're going to take a look at\noutlining the idea here of what we\n\n14\n00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.610\nhave to do when we talk about\nmanaging Project changes.\n\n15\n00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.510\nSo we need to have a process in mind.\n\n16\n00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.710\nRemember that what ends up happening\nwith Projects is fairly simple.\n\n17\n00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.490\nEven though we establish\na scope statement,\n\n18\n00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.370\neven though we believe we know what\nwe want to accomplish in our project,\n\n19\n00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.380\nthere's always going to be outside\ninfluence, internal influences,\n\n20\n00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.780\nanything that can get in your way\nto add in more or to change things.\n\n21\n00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.210\nAnd it's not that those things are bad,\nokay, but\n\n22\n00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.040\nthey can actually end up derailing\nyour project if you are not careful\n\n23\n00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.180\nin the way that you can\nhandle these changes.\n\n24\n00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.270\nSo one of those key elements when we\nstart taking layout of course then is to\n\n25\n00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.130\nactually come up with some type of plan,\nsome type of process to make sure that\n\n26\n00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.830\nwe know how we handle changes that\nwill directly affect our project.\n\n27\n00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.980\nAnd so when it begins and we start\nthinking about it, right, what you and\n\n28\n00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.940\nI really have to do is to sit there and\ntry and figure out what are some of\n\n29\n00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.670\nthe things that we can implement to insure\nthat we handle changes that come along.\n\n30\n00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.400\nWell, one of the key things is to\nunderstand that very fact, okay.\n\n31\n00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.500\nChanges are more likely going\nto creep into the project\n\n32\n00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.210\nif you do not know that changes\ncan affect your project.\n\n33\n00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.270\nSo you've go to actually accept\nthe inevitable cliche once again,\n\n34\n00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.650\neven though I swear in the entire\nseries I'm not gonna be cliche,\n\n35\n00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.250\nthe only change that's not\nchangeable is change, okay?\n\n36\n00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.356\nAnd that is pretty much the truth of\nmatter is that change's will end up\n\n37\n00:02:24.356 --> 00:02:25.780\nhappening.\n\n38\n00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.469\nAnd the problem that we\nhave a lot of times,\n\n39\n00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:33.555\nespecially when we're novice project\nmanagers, and we don't think about it,\n\n40\n00:02:33.555 --> 00:02:38.150\nis that we assume because we are quick\nthinking guys or people out there.\n\n41\n00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.730\nI don't mean to exclude the ladies out\nthere for doing project management.\n\n42\n00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.460\nBut we're fairly quick thinking.\n\n43\n00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.230\nDaniel, we're pretty smart guys, okay?\n\n44\n00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.420\n>> Yeah, we like to move on our\nfeet as light as we possibly can.\n\n45\n00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.160\n>> And so when changes happen,\ndon't get me wrong, it might upset us for\n\n46\n00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.200\na moment or two.\n\n47\n00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.330\nBut we tend to adjust and\nwe tend to go okay, so\n\n48\n00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.040\nwe'll take that and we'll just move on and\nwe'll do the best that we can.\n\n49\n00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.100\nAnd normally it doesn't\nthrow us off track too much.\n\n50\n00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.580\nBut when we start talking about\nmanaging a project, well,\n\n51\n00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.195\nthat no longer just affects you or me as\na project manager or just Daniel anymore.\n\n52\n00:03:10.195 --> 00:03:13.040\nAnd I go, man that just kinda threw\nme off for a little bit, but yeah,\n\n53\n00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.760\nI'll take that and\nI'll get it done anyways and continue on.\n\n54\n00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.250\nNow you're talking about effecting,\nwell, a chain of events, right.\n\n55\n00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.170\nNow what you don't realize is\nthat one particular change,\n\n56\n00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.920\neven depending on when it happens during\nyour project, can really throw off so\n\n57\n00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.110\nmany other events that can\nend up happening is amazing.\n\n58\n00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.020\nSo imagine the idea of\nsomething like this.\n\n59\n00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.480\nAnd this is not some type of formal change\nor something that somebody wants changed,\n\n60\n00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.390\nbut imagine when you are on a roll and\nyour deadline is, let's say today, and\n\n61\n00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.020\nnow a key person on your team for\naccomplishing your project.\n\n62\n00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.180\nI called you at 3 o'clock this morning,\nand\n\n63\n00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.390\nsaid I am so ill that I am waiting\nin the emergency room right now.\n\n64\n00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.475\nThere is no way I can get\nout of the emergency room,\n\n65\n00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:03.400\nit looks like I am gonna be there all day.\n\n66\n00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.790\nAnd heaven forbid that that\nreally happen but imagine that,\n\n67\n00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.626\nimagine just a change like that, right.\n\n68\n00:04:08.626 --> 00:04:12.842\nThings that you thought you were gonna\naccomplish today, finish up, and\n\n69\n00:04:12.842 --> 00:04:15.707\neverything else without\nthat key player in hand.\n\n70\n00:04:15.707 --> 00:04:19.934\nThe very fact is that it might now\nactually have been delayed and\n\n71\n00:04:19.934 --> 00:04:23.536\nthat delay could actually\nhave other consequences.\n\n72\n00:04:23.536 --> 00:04:27.481\nSuch as other things that thought\nthey were gonna be starting with say,\n\n73\n00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:31.571\nperhaps if today's a Friday, and\nwe were starting something on Monday.\n\n74\n00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:35.898\nWell now we're delaying whatever events\nactually might have happened on Monday,\n\n75\n00:04:35.898 --> 00:04:40.176\nmight push that back to Tuesday instead,\nand now a whole series begins to happen.\n\n76\n00:04:40.176 --> 00:04:45.069\nAnd I see these things when they talk\nabout in movies what they call butterfly\n\n77\n00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.288\neffects of things that end up happening,\nright.\n\n78\n00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:52.463\nAnd those are just inconsequential changes\nwhere somebody actually took the idea of\n\n79\n00:04:52.463 --> 00:04:56.299\nmaybe a butterfly flapping over here\nends up being a tornado somewhere else.\n\n80\n00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.220\nIn reality, I don't think that that\neffect actually is supposed to happen\n\n81\n00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.620\nas far as physics goes.\n\n82\n00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.580\nBut overall though,\nif something like that,\n\n83\n00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.510\na small change can actually\naffect just your life like that.\n\n84\n00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.310\nImagine now if you had everything planned\nout in the way that you wanted to and\n\n85\n00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.500\nnow somebody does try to introduce\na change and you're not ready for, okay.\n\n86\n00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.830\nWell again, the impact of that is\nactually what we need to avoid.\n\n87\n00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.460\nSo what do we need to have\non hand to avoid that,\n\n88\n00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.620\nis what we're talking about today, okay?\n\n89\n00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.245\nWhat we need to have on hand essentially\nis a fairly light-weight element that we\n\n90\n00:05:31.245 --> 00:05:34.450\ncall some type of process for\nmanaging changes, okay.\n\n91\n00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.780\nAnd that's what it come down to is\njust a very light-weight process.\n\n92\n00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.063\nNow that, of course,\nit works on scales, right.\n\n93\n00:05:42.063 --> 00:05:44.222\nThe larger the scale of your project,\n\n94\n00:05:44.222 --> 00:05:47.942\nthe larger that this management\nthing is going to happen, okay.\n\n95\n00:05:47.942 --> 00:05:51.278\nA smaller scale, of course it\nactually happens very quickly and\n\n96\n00:05:51.278 --> 00:05:55.440\nit can be done very easily, so let me\nkinda give you an example personally here.\n\n97\n00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.386\nAs we work on more and different shows for\nITProTV, there are sometimes\n\n98\n00:06:00.386 --> 00:06:05.590\nwhere we create our own labs and\nthings don't work out exactly right then.\n\n99\n00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.410\nWell what actually what ends\nup when I'm creating that lab?\n\n100\n00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.900\nWell all I have to do is go, hey Daniel,\ncan you take a look at this for me?\n\n101\n00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.830\nAnd Daniel takes a look and all of\na sudden he said let me try something.\n\n102\n00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.920\nThen he tries it and it fixes it, okay.\n\n103\n00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:23.000\nOn that scale no big deal, but now what\nif it's actually a gigantic project that\n\n104\n00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.590\nall of a sudden Daniel has\nto involve in his team.\n\n105\n00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.700\nThey have to stop doing\nwhat they have to do.\n\n106\n00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.470\nThey can't get their work done.\n\n107\n00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.610\nNow that's a little bit different, right?\n\n108\n00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.330\nSo what do we need?\n\n109\n00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.490\nWhat we need to do is again think\nabout what the basic process is\n\n110\n00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.970\nthat we need to go through.\n\n111\n00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.260\nSo let me show you what CompTIA's actually\nthinking about when they talk about\n\n112\n00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.640\nthe idea of the process for\nmanaging project changes, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.645\nSo when we start to take a look at\nthis a little bit more in detail here,\n\n114\n00:06:50.645 --> 00:06:54.876\nwell, it comes down to something that\na lot of us are not used to anymore.\n\n115\n00:06:54.876 --> 00:06:58.650\nIt's just like around here we try and\nbe as paper free as possible.\n\n116\n00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.720\nNow, does that mean we're paper free?\n\n117\n00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.090\nNo, by no means, but we try and\nbe as paper free as possible.\n\n118\n00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.030\nBut it comes down to\nthings as simple as forms.\n\n119\n00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.640\nForms are a very tangible way,\nright, that what\n\n120\n00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.070\nactually gives some control over our\nproject here as far as project changes,\n\n121\n00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:21.350\nis that now somebody doesn't just get to\nspout off as they're walking out the door,\n\n122\n00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.340\ndon't forget that change,\nI said, and walk off.\n\n123\n00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.310\nOkay, and then I'm like,\nwhat was that, Dan?\n\n124\n00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.220\nWhat did he say?\n\n125\n00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.600\nI don't know, and then we chase him down\nthe hall, and he has to explain again.\n\n126\n00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.040\nThat's not something we want.\n\n127\n00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.875\nBy actually creating forms, right, and\n\n128\n00:07:36.875 --> 00:07:42.221\nmake sure that we have documentation that\nnow if Daniel and I didn't catch it,\n\n129\n00:07:42.221 --> 00:07:47.324\nwe simply go to form that was submitted,\nand that form really helps us out.\n\n130\n00:07:47.324 --> 00:07:51.794\nSo normally when you talk about what are\nat least the basic forms you have on hand,\n\n131\n00:07:51.794 --> 00:07:55.961\nfor some type of processing change,\nit's gonna come down to three forms.\n\n132\n00:07:55.961 --> 00:08:00.988\nNow Remember, your organization may have\n15 forms that you have to fill out, okay.\n\n133\n00:08:00.988 --> 00:08:03.770\nBut at least these three is what\nyou're gonna end up seeing.\n\n134\n00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.700\nSome type of official change request form\n\n135\n00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.070\nis what your going to normally\nwork with here, okay?\n\n136\n00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:14.390\nThat change request form is the formal\ninitiation that somebody says look,\n\n137\n00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.380\na change has to be in place.\n\n138\n00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:21.460\nYou may also end up as far as\nthe change management process goes, and\n\n139\n00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.560\nthis is depending on how\nthat process is handled,\n\n140\n00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.330\nis that somebody has a checklist\nright along with that.\n\n141\n00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:32.090\nSo if Daniel were to submit\na change request form okay,\n\n142\n00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.920\nhe might also end up after he submits that\nand let's say to the project management\n\n143\n00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.530\noffice or to the project manager, the\nproject manager may also have another form\n\n144\n00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:44.000\nin which he says all right, I'm checking\nthis off that I've received this form, and\n\n145\n00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.070\nthen it passes on to the next\nresponsible group that needs to.\n\n146\n00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:52.761\nAnd that way they follow that process\nto make sure that Daniel's not\n\n147\n00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:55.819\ngetting cheated out of this whole process.\n\n148\n00:08:55.819 --> 00:08:59.354\nDidn't just take a look at this and\n[SOUND] put it in the desk there,\n\n149\n00:08:59.354 --> 00:09:02.262\nor the nice circular file that\nis at the end of my desk.\n\n150\n00:09:02.262 --> 00:09:03.656\nAnd Daniel's-\n>> File 13.\n\n151\n00:09:03.656 --> 00:09:05.118\n>> Yeah, file 13.\n\n152\n00:09:05.118 --> 00:09:07.515\nDid Ronnie actually really\nprocess this through, but\n\n153\n00:09:07.515 --> 00:09:09.088\nfollow something like that along.\n\n154\n00:09:09.088 --> 00:09:12.060\nAnd then ultimately\nthere's a change log too.\n\n155\n00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.320\nLet's take a look at some examples of\nthese, and then we'll come back here.\n\n156\n00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.910\nSo I don't have them in any particular\norder but let me go ahead and\n\n157\n00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.340\nsee if I can bring up a couple of them.\n\n158\n00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.480\nSo here's a template that\nwe've created a while ago so\n\n159\n00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.300\nthat we can actually take a look here,\nokay?\n\n160\n00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:31.060\nSo imagine this, imagine that what we have\nis a form that looks like this where we\n\n161\n00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:35.400\ncan actually fill in the data, what the\nproject title is that we're working on and\n\n162\n00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.450\nremember if you have a work\nbreakdown structure,\n\n163\n00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.900\nyou may also refer to it by\nthat particular number as well.\n\n164\n00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.550\nWho the project manager is and\nof course the date that\n\n165\n00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.160\nthis particular form was prepared\nas well as the actual requestor.\n\n166\n00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.320\nIn other words,\nwho's actually requesting this.\n\n167\n00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.000\nNow this change number is not something\nthat the person that's submitting this\n\n168\n00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.530\nis going to have on hand.\n\n169\n00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.420\nNormally what ends up happening here is\nthat this might depend on the project\n\n170\n00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.330\nmanager himself or on that project\nmanagement office that says\n\n171\n00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:08.220\nhere's how that change number is actually\ngoing to start sequencing itself and\n\n172\n00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.240\nwe need to keep this in hand.\n\n173\n00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.260\nUsually of course there is also\nthen an actual check mark here.\n\n174\n00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.450\nIt doesn't have to be a check mark it\ncan be simply you writing this in.\n\n175\n00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:23.122\nBut notice that, at least according to my\nparticular one that I have here, is that\n\n176\n00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:27.657\nwe'll take a look at is this a change to\nthe scope of the project, the quality any\n\n177\n00:10:27.657 --> 00:10:32.230\nother requirements that we have on hand,\nis this a change to the cost.\n\n178\n00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:33.800\nSaying, hey, I just messed up something.\n\n179\n00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.080\nI need to actually submit this\nbecause I didn't get it right.\n\n180\n00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.930\nThe schedule or even other documentation.\n\n181\n00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:46.440\nThe other thing, of course, is a detailed,\nthen, description of the proposed change.\n\n182\n00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.960\nNow, I have this box here and\n\n183\n00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.470\nin reality it looks like it's\nabout an inch and a half.\n\n184\n00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.850\nMost of the time you might even\nhave a separate sheet of paper\n\n185\n00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.150\nwhere you say see attachment on this.\n\n186\n00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.690\nSo if this is not a room don't go,\nI'm only supposed to fill in this box.\n\n187\n00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.730\nMost people would love it if you\ncould actually fit it all in here.\n\n188\n00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:08.290\nBut the reality is you need to take as\nmuch time as you need to to explain\n\n189\n00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.060\nthe actual description of what you want.\n\n190\n00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.330\nJustification for why you propose\nthat change is also going to be key.\n\n191\n00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.020\nBecause remember,\nthat even though you submit this,\n\n192\n00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.340\nit doesn't mean that everybody has\nseen it from your perspective.\n\n193\n00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.410\nAnd that means that they make reject\nit just because they can't tell.\n\n194\n00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.620\nWell you want to make sure that you\nactually go ahead and submit and\n\n195\n00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.990\njustify that proposed change.\n\n196\n00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.750\nYou also need to understand\nthat your change can have\n\n197\n00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.130\nan impact in a broad manner.\n\n198\n00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.160\nAnd that is actually a key element.\n\n199\n00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.860\nNow not just on working on projects,\nright?\n\n200\n00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.286\nBut in any organization in which make\nchanges, let's say like to network\n\n201\n00:11:43.286 --> 00:11:46.390\ninfrastructure, or anything like this,\nyou may not consider it.\n\n202\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.330\nAnd you may just think of course\nwe need to optimize this,\n\n203\n00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.710\nwe need to do this change and\njust go ahead and submit it.\n\n204\n00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.590\nI remember one time where we did have\na situation like this where we needed to\n\n205\n00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:01.970\nchange something, but changing it right\nthen was not a good thing for us to do.\n\n206\n00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:05.910\nSo you go and talk to who you need to and\nsay, yeah, that's a change we need to do,\n\n207\n00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:09.700\nbut we can't do it during the day when\neverybody's actually connected and\n\n208\n00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.390\nthey need their phones working.\n\n209\n00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.190\nThey need the internet connection working.\n\n210\n00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.700\nWe need those VPN tunnels to stay up.\n\n211\n00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.480\nSo, when we actually brought it up,\nwe, kinda, realized something.\n\n212\n00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.690\nThat, if we were to change it at 11\no'clock in the morning, way bad idea.\n\n213\n00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:27.480\nChange it at 10 in the evening, or\n11 in the evening, much better idea.\n\n214\n00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.680\nSo, to understand the impact of\nthe change, and what the result of\n\n215\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.770\nit could be, whether it's positive,\nor negative, is also something else.\n\n216\n00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.590\nAnd additional comments.\n\n217\n00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:40.400\nAnd this particular second page,\nthough, also allows us to be able to,\n\n218\n00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.190\nonce we have it submitted,\nin the approval process,\n\n219\n00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:47.120\nthis is what is the outcome of that\napproval process, or denial process.\n\n220\n00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.940\nIn other words, how are we disposing\nof this change request, right?\n\n221\n00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.430\nIs it approved?\n\n222\n00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:54.740\nAre we going to defer it?\n\n223\n00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.680\nAnd we may choose to actually\ninitiate that as a deferral instead,\n\n224\n00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.530\nwhich says look, we don't have\nenough information right now.\n\n225\n00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.740\nAnd we may go ahead and say look not\nenough information in justification.\n\n226\n00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:10.080\nPlease ask Daniel to resubmit\nmore information regarding\n\n227\n00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.780\nwhatever it might be.\n\n228\n00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.680\nAnd whoever is actually gonna be on that\nchange control board, in other words,\n\n229\n00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.020\nwho actually authorizes these changes,\nwe should also get them to provide their\n\n230\n00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:25.280\nsignature as well as name and verify that\nat the end, how it was actually disposed.\n\n231\n00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.600\nSo that official change request\nform is a fairly good form\n\n232\n00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:34.250\nthat really does slow down the process and\nnot allow\n\n233\n00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:40.070\nthe urgency of the change to actually\nbecome more important than it really is.\n\n234\n00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:42.980\nEverybody that submits a change\nswears that its the most urgent\n\n235\n00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.210\nthing in the world.\n\n236\n00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.970\nYou look at it and go, yeah,\nthat's a change that can be done, but\n\n237\n00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:48.950\ndoes it have to be done right now?\n\n238\n00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:51.630\nWell, according to the person\nwho submitted it, probably.\n\n239\n00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.900\nBut when you take everybody who looked at\nit and go, well that's something that is\n\n240\n00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.900\nkinda secondary to everything\nthat we're trying to accomplish.\n\n241\n00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.900\nYou may end up seeing that as well.\n\n242\n00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.480\nSo being able, excuse me,\nI'm about to cough here.\n\n243\n00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.640\nBeing able to actually submit this, and\n\n244\n00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.365\nhave somebody else review it,\na great part of the process.\n\n245\n00:14:07.365 --> 00:14:08.015\n>> Yeah\n>> Yeah, Ronnie,\n\n246\n00:14:08.015 --> 00:14:12.265\nI've worked a lot with change\nforms in the electronic format,\n\n247\n00:14:12.265 --> 00:14:15.535\nwhich is probably going to be\na whole lot more prevalent as we\n\n248\n00:14:15.535 --> 00:14:18.190\nbecome a more technologically\nadvanced culture.\n\n249\n00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.735\n[LAUGH] We try and\nget rid of that paper, right?\n\n250\n00:14:20.735 --> 00:14:22.335\nWe don't want paper.\n\n251\n00:14:22.335 --> 00:14:23.865\nBut these were key.\n\n252\n00:14:23.865 --> 00:14:25.110\nI couldn't do work.\n\n253\n00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:29.630\nAnd I always said I had a love hate\nrelationship with change requests because\n\n254\n00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:35.230\nI had to document what I was going to do,\nwhat I was doing, and what I did.\n\n255\n00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.790\nBasically it's an electronic\nmicromanager or\n\n256\n00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:41.130\nit's a paper form of a micromanager,\nat least in some sense.\n\n257\n00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.340\nSo you end up hating having to\nalways typing stuff up, but it also,\n\n258\n00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.770\nyou had to love it because anything\nthat you did was documented.\n\n259\n00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.870\nIt was, here's exactly what I did.\n\n260\n00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.230\nAnd you approved it because\nthere's the approval right there.\n\n261\n00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.390\nSo we start seeing the importance of it.\n\n262\n00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:56.550\nSo it's easier for you.\n\n263\n00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.960\nIf you hate change request forms,\njust learn to embrace them.\n\n264\n00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.660\nJust say, you know what,\nthis is really an insurance policy for me,\n\n265\n00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:08.110\nin case things go wrong, to prove that I\ndid exactly what I said I was going to do.\n\n266\n00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:13.400\nAnd that they approved me to do that, so\nit is a good necessary evil, should I say.\n\n267\n00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.180\n>> It really is.\n\n268\n00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:18.270\nIt does help in that process of being\nable to know at least a couple of things.\n\n269\n00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:21.690\nOne, the requester himself, whoever is\ndoing it, knows that it's been handled.\n\n270\n00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:22.350\nOkay?\n\n271\n00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.600\nKnows that it's not just\nsitting on someone's desk.\n\n272\n00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:29.374\nKnows it's not just not going anywhere,\nright, but actually has some process that\n\n273\n00:15:29.374 --> 00:15:33.138\nhe can check in on and verify that\nthat is actually still in action,\n\n274\n00:15:33.138 --> 00:15:36.390\nstill gonna be what needs to\nbe done as far as submission.\n\n275\n00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:40.800\nDoesn't guarantee an outright approval but\nit does guarantee that at least Daniel\n\n276\n00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.509\nknows what his particular\nrequest has been heard,\n\n277\n00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:45.476\nsome decision may be made on it soon.\n\n278\n00:15:45.476 --> 00:15:47.689\nNow let me show you a couple\nof other documents here,\n\n279\n00:15:47.689 --> 00:15:48.957\na little bit quickly as well.\n\n280\n00:15:48.957 --> 00:15:52.338\nSo you may also as a project manager\nkeep what we call a change log So\n\n281\n00:15:52.338 --> 00:15:55.166\nif Daniel comes to me and\nI'm the project manager, and\n\n282\n00:15:55.166 --> 00:15:58.302\nhe says I really want to submit\nthis particular change down,\n\n283\n00:15:58.302 --> 00:16:02.627\nthat's true if he actually says I'm\ncoming in $10,000 over budget or not.\n\n284\n00:16:02.627 --> 00:16:06.539\nI still give him the same form,\nI don't treat it any differently, but\n\n285\n00:16:06.539 --> 00:16:10.648\nwhat I do is I keep a track of all those\nchanges, right here, for myself and\n\n286\n00:16:10.648 --> 00:16:13.490\nfor the posterity of the project as well.\n\n287\n00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:17.620\nAnd I hand him that form and I go ahead\nand I mark down the number, when I give\n\n288\n00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.760\nhim the form I put down that change\nnumber as well that change ID number, and\n\n289\n00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.405\nthat keeps a track of it all the way\nthrough until it actually gets to\n\n290\n00:16:24.405 --> 00:16:27.710\nthe change board, so here's\nsomething that you might also track.\n\n291\n00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:33.060\nNow once we actually get to, let me\nsee if I can find the third one here.\n\n292\n00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.830\nA lot of times when we start, and actually\nI'll bring this up a little bit later,\n\n293\n00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.040\nthat change, management worksheet,\nwe're about to get to it, but\n\n294\n00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.590\nI have to kind of flip through it.\n\n295\n00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:43.940\nSo let me point out the second point here,\nso\n\n296\n00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:47.065\nwe'll take a look at change manage\nIntro worksheet in the moment.\n\n297\n00:16:47.065 --> 00:16:51.425\nSo when we talk about now,\nwhat is the approval for the change.\n\n298\n00:16:51.425 --> 00:16:54.565\nSo just because Daniel submitted\na change doesn't mean that it's outright\n\n299\n00:16:54.565 --> 00:16:56.375\nautomatically accepted or rejected.\n\n300\n00:16:56.375 --> 00:16:59.970\nJust because we look at his name and\ngo, it's from Daniel, rejection!\n\n301\n00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:00.925\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Reject.\n\n302\n00:17:00.925 --> 00:17:02.145\n>> Turn it down.\n\n303\n00:17:02.145 --> 00:17:04.525\n>> Yeah, deferred, declined,\n\n304\n00:17:04.525 --> 00:17:08.850\nwhatever we might have here, but\nthere has to be some review process.\n\n305\n00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:11.660\nNow, the review process is gonna be\ndifferent for every organization.\n\n306\n00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:15.220\nYou know, I can't tell you what\nevery review process is gonna be.\n\n307\n00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.990\nFor all we know, it's like what you\nsee in the movies where everybody is\n\n308\n00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.150\ngiven a white stone and a black stone.\n\n309\n00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.790\nIt's like the Delphi technique.\n\n310\n00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.630\nWhere now they pull up the stones.\n\n311\n00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:27.730\nLook, they all put them in five black,\none white.\n\n312\n00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.240\nHe's gonna lose that vote.\n\n313\n00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.890\nBut, it might be something like that.\n\n314\n00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:34.150\nBut, it actually is about how\nin the world they go about it.\n\n315\n00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.700\nAnd, it needs to be fairly\nsystematic here okay?\n\n316\n00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.700\nNow, can it be influenced?\n\n317\n00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.330\nProbably, but the overall nature\nis that everybody's working for\n\n318\n00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.410\nthe good of the project,\nthat's what you have to do.\n\n319\n00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.560\nThere has to be some type of\nformalized process to it.\n\n320\n00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.510\nYou wanna make sure that the objections\nare handled, okay, so that when the change\n\n321\n00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:55.270\ncomes up and somebody objects to it,\nmake sure that you tell them, or\n\n322\n00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.880\nwhoever's actually objecting,\nmake sure that they actually explain why.\n\n323\n00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.110\nYou want to give everybody\na chance to be heard.\n\n324\n00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.400\nThe idea behind this is simple, right.\n\n325\n00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:07.350\nYou never want to shut somebody up,\njust because they're in the minority.\n\n326\n00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:11.930\nI know that sounds like the greatest\nway to rule, but in reality though,\n\n327\n00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:15.270\nit doesn't find a solution,\nright, as far as the changes go.\n\n328\n00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.860\nHere you want to make sure that\nyou have some process that says,\n\n329\n00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.660\nlook your objection is heard.\n\n330\n00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.270\nHere's why we're still voting, and\nthat way the person says, yeah okay,\n\n331\n00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.450\nI understand that, okay,\nof why I'm not doing it right now.\n\n332\n00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:29.120\nSometimes it happens just like we said.\n\n333\n00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.150\nIt's not that it's rejected overall,\nor declined I should say.\n\n334\n00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.510\nNot that it's declined overall\nbecause there's something\n\n335\n00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:38.280\nproblematic with the change.\n\n336\n00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.690\nBut what if another change was\nsubmitted right before Daniel's?\n\n337\n00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:45.890\nAnd the same date that Daniel submitted\nto actually implement the change\n\n338\n00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.070\nis the date that we just approved for\nsomebody else?\n\n339\n00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:51.210\nWell Daniel, you and I have worked\nin IT long enough to know that\n\n340\n00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:55.490\nif we have multiple changes going on,\nwe can't tell where our problems come in.\n\n341\n00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.050\nSo usually, we might say what?\n\n342\n00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:01.790\nLet's hold off on making one change\nrather than trying to make what?\n\n343\n00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:03.060\nTwo changes at the say time.\n\n344\n00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:06.390\n>> Yeah, you gotta be aware of when you\nhave multiple people trying to make\n\n345\n00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:07.180\nchanges at the same time,\n\n346\n00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.065\nwell what will happen is something\ngoes wrong, who do we blame?\n\n347\n00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:11.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Was it Ronny's changes or\n\n348\n00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.150\nwas it my changes?\n\n349\n00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:14.290\nWell we did it at the same time,\n\n350\n00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.540\nso we don't know what the factor\nwas to caused the issue.\n\n351\n00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.359\nSo it causes a little to much confusion so\nit's always better and\n\n352\n00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:24.500\nwhat Ronny's trying to say is that\nmight be a good reason to reject it.\n\n353\n00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.370\nNot that it's a wrong idea or something we\nshouldn't do, it's just the time is off.\n\n354\n00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.957\nWe need to change the different time,\nresubmit your change, and\n\n355\n00:19:30.957 --> 00:19:31.907\nthen we can approve it.\n\n356\n00:19:31.907 --> 00:19:33.060\nThat's how it works.\n\n357\n00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.410\n>> That's what we want to make sure of.\n\n358\n00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:37.480\nIs that we have some ability to do that.\n\n359\n00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.890\nBut it shouldn't just be,\nwell, I'm just rejecting Jay.\n\n360\n00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:41.720\nI'm gonna change because\nhe wore a blue shirt today.\n\n361\n00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.842\nI mean, good gracious!\n\n362\n00:19:42.842 --> 00:19:43.910\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n363\n00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:45.820\n>> So\nit should be some type of process there.\n\n364\n00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:49.230\nAnd then of course, you know how are we\nactually gonna decide the change?\n\n365\n00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.890\nThere has to be some decision.\n\n366\n00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.850\nIt might just be a simple vote, but\n\n367\n00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:56.080\nit might just be the idea\nof consensus instead.\n\n368\n00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.640\nThat it doesn't have to\nbe a unanimous vote,\n\n369\n00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.980\nit's just a consensus that everybody\nagrees that this is what's gonna happen.\n\n370\n00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:05.020\nNormally, that's not the greatest idea,\nbut what we want to do is make sure\n\n371\n00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.250\nthat we present the facts and\nthen everybody agrees that.\n\n372\n00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.970\nYeah this is not a good change, or\nwe actually need to defer it, or\n\n373\n00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:12.970\nwhatever it might be.\n\n374\n00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:16.560\nSo it's not always just accept or reject,\nyou might have that idea of deferral.\n\n375\n00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.890\nAnd ultimately somebody needs\nto sign off on it, okay?\n\n376\n00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.460\nAnd that's usually gonna be\nthose people hat are sitting\n\n377\n00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.880\nthere making that decision, and\nthere's a justification again for\n\n378\n00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.438\nwhat actually happens with\nthe disposition of it, right?\n\n379\n00:20:28.438 --> 00:20:33.170\nSo here's why we approved it or\nhere's why we absolutely declined it or\n\n380\n00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.400\nhere's why we're deferring it as well.\n\n381\n00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.570\nNow the other one that I've\nput here is fairly simple,\n\n382\n00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.670\nand this is something\nwe should all live by.\n\n383\n00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:41.620\nAnd if you're in project\nmanagement you live and\n\n384\n00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.340\nyou die by the idea of the clock,\nyou really do.\n\n385\n00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:50.540\nThere has to be, of course,\na limited turnaround time for the changes.\n\n386\n00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:55.670\nI should not just be able to essentially\nhold something in that committee\n\n387\n00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:58.030\nuntil the fact that Daniel just goes,\nI'm giving up.\n\n388\n00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:59.870\nI'm not even gonna think about it again,\n\n389\n00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.090\ncuz they're never gonna\naccept another change okay?\n\n390\n00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:06.510\nThere should be clearly\ndefined timelines that say\n\n391\n00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:10.720\nonce this process is submitted and\napproved that project number.\n\n392\n00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.120\nMight even going to be based on that.\n\n393\n00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.060\nOnce that project number\nhas been assigned and\n\n394\n00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.210\nthe project management\noffice knows about it.\n\n395\n00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.930\nFive days or three days or two days.\n\n396\n00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:23.640\nNow can there actually be\nemergency changes that happen?\n\n397\n00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.580\nYes, there can.\n\n398\n00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.270\nOkay?\n\n399\n00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:29.190\nSo, if you do have to deal with\nan emergency, you actually do mark it as\n\n400\n00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:32.860\nan emergency and\nusually that's within 24 to 48 hours and\n\n401\n00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.430\nsomething like that can actually\nbe addressed at that point.\n\n402\n00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:39.820\nBut when you do that, you really have an\nunusual thing because you're probably not\n\n403\n00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:43.930\ngonna get that full committee that would\nnormally take some time to look at it.\n\n404\n00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:47.700\nWhat you're probably gonna get is an ad\nhoc committee at that particular point in\n\n405\n00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:52.180\ntime that's just gonna make essentially an\nexecutive decision and you're gonna live\n\n406\n00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.330\nand die by that if you choose\nsomething like that to make emergency.\n\n407\n00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:56.420\nBut do those things have to happen?\n\n408\n00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.500\nYes, okay.\n\n409\n00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.280\nSo just kinda realize.\n\n410\n00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.160\nBut just kinda realize that there\nis gonna be turnaround time.\n\n411\n00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.620\nA lot of times, most people don't\nunderstand why you're submitting change.\n\n412\n00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.660\nSo they need to read that.\n\n413\n00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:09.740\nYou need as full detailed as\npossible in that request form so\n\n414\n00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.570\nthat the people that get it,\nand they're looking at for\n\n415\n00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:14.950\nthe first time that they have enough\ninformation to make that decision.\n\n416\n00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.400\nDon't get me wrong when you submit it and\n\n417\n00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.260\nthey actually do meet, you might\nbe sitting right outside the door\n\n418\n00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.410\nwaiting to see if they have\nany other questions for you.\n\n419\n00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.200\nBut a lot of times it might just be\nthat they just need enough information.\n\n420\n00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.940\nSo they might tell you,\nthere's this 36 hours for\n\n421\n00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.535\nthem to review the process, and then\nwhen they come together they'll meet for\n\n422\n00:22:33.535 --> 00:22:37.835\na vote, so you'll know within 48 hours or\nmaybe three to five days.\n\n423\n00:22:37.835 --> 00:22:39.335\nA lot of time.\n\n424\n00:22:39.335 --> 00:22:42.825\n>> So, Ronnie, now that we understand\na little more about change and\n\n425\n00:22:42.825 --> 00:22:45.015\nchange management, using change laws and\n\n426\n00:22:45.015 --> 00:22:48.665\ndocumentation, I guess the real\nquestion is now how do I get that into\n\n427\n00:22:48.665 --> 00:22:52.915\nthe hands of the people that are under me,\nor as a project manager how do I get them?\n\n428\n00:22:52.915 --> 00:22:53.795\nHow do my people get them?\n\n429\n00:22:53.795 --> 00:22:57.890\nAnd then, once changes are approved, How\ndoes that distribute out to everyone so\n\n430\n00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:59.050\nthat they know what to do?\n\n431\n00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:01.030\n>> That is again, the key, right?\n\n432\n00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:03.049\nIs that there's a couple of ways, right?\n\n433\n00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:07.260\nThat if you go back into the movies in the\nolden days, you know some herald announces\n\n434\n00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:13.700\nit out to the town square and says,\nhere's what the decree of the king says.\n\n435\n00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.700\nAnd you know, you just assume\neverybody's gonna be there to do so, but\n\n436\n00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.510\nin today's world that we're so\nmobile and everything.\n\n437\n00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:23.490\nYou may not have anything that\nactually does the same thing.\n\n438\n00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:26.260\nSo, you do have to come up with\nwhat we call some type of document\n\n439\n00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.580\nrouting process that handles everything.\n\n440\n00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.677\nAnd I mean it, from the very beginning\nto the time of the disposition of this.\n\n441\n00:23:32.677 --> 00:23:36.580\nSo, when we take a look here, let me go\nahead and do that and so, here it is.\n\n442\n00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:41.406\nDocument routing, We need to actually\nhave a true process in hand for\n\n443\n00:23:41.406 --> 00:23:44.579\nhow the request is handled and\ndistributed.\n\n444\n00:23:44.579 --> 00:23:48.043\nRemember that once this is submitted\nto whoever it's submitted to,\n\n445\n00:23:48.043 --> 00:23:52.168\nthat the change management board might\nactually be distributed across the entire\n\n446\n00:23:52.168 --> 00:23:53.437\ncounty that you live in.\n\n447\n00:23:53.437 --> 00:23:55.166\nSo how is that going to go?\n\n448\n00:23:55.166 --> 00:23:59.569\nIs somebody actually gonna say alright, so\nit goes in the project management office,\n\n449\n00:23:59.569 --> 00:24:03.610\nall the people on change request board,\nthey will receive it within two hours,\n\n450\n00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:07.140\nwithin the day, you know, and\nhow is it actually gonna be received?\n\n451\n00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.730\nIs it actually something that's done\nby courier, is this actually a written\n\n452\n00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:15.030\ndocumentation on paper that they have to\nbe able to read, can it be done by email,\n\n453\n00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.750\nwhatever it might be.\n\n454\n00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.970\nWe need a formal process that says\nhere's something that's gonna happen.\n\n455\n00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:23.410\nAnd it normally also announces that\na meeting's gonna be taking place.\n\n456\n00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.080\nNow also remember that the approval, or\n\n457\n00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:30.530\nalso of course the declining of this,\nalso needs to be addressed and\n\n458\n00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:33.950\ndistributed as well, and what\nare the formal channels for that, okay?\n\n459\n00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:35.760\nSo you might found out that\nthe formal channel for\n\n460\n00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.990\nthe approval is Whatever it might be.\n\n461\n00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:40.270\nWhere it's announced to\nthe project manager.\n\n462\n00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:43.720\nThe project manager will then announce\nthat to whoever he wants to and\n\n463\n00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.260\nthey'll distribute it out.\n\n464\n00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:50.070\nBut usually though especially on\na decline of some sort it might be if it\n\n465\n00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:52.540\nonly effects that one department\nyou don't announce it to everybody.\n\n466\n00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:53.090\nOkay?\n\n467\n00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:57.330\nNow if it actually effects every\ndepartment, so let's say that Daniel for\n\n468\n00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.420\none reason or another,\ngot nominated to make this change and\n\n469\n00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:05.130\nit's because it affected like six or\nseven different steps in the project.\n\n470\n00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:08.340\nAnd Daniel said,\nyeah I'll submit that change, but\n\n471\n00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:13.260\nnow nobody else is willing to stand up and\nsay I approved that change.\n\n472\n00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.590\nAnd Daniel is standing there,\n\n473\n00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:19.220\nwell normally that's why you\nhandle that idea of rejection.\n\n474\n00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:23.110\nIn private and you go \"Daniel you know,\nthis is how it happens.\" But\n\n475\n00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:26.520\nif you need to male a statement go\n\"alright we're not doing that change.\" And\n\n476\n00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.690\neverybody gets it all at one time.\n\n477\n00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.360\nYou also have to start doing some team\nbuilding if you start doing something\n\n478\n00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.010\nlike that.\n\n479\n00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:34.980\nJust kind of realize that document\nrouting is actually part of it.\n\n480\n00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:38.580\nAnd last step step here of course\nis that idea of communication flow.\n\n481\n00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:43.090\nNow when we talk about It's\nfairly difficult, right,\n\n482\n00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:47.570\nto have great communication with a whole\nbunch of people at the same time.\n\n483\n00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.220\nUsually when that happens, right,\nit's really one voice that goes over\n\n484\n00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.300\nan intercom or\none email that's distributed to everybody.\n\n485\n00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.640\nBut there's no real great\nfeedback system that we have, and\n\n486\n00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.440\nno real great communication system that\nactually addresses everybody's needs.\n\n487\n00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.170\nSo we need to make sure that we\nhave some communication flow.\n\n488\n00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.050\nFrom the very beginning, like I said.\n\n489\n00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.730\nAnd this is the important thing, okay?\n\n490\n00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:11.070\nHow is that request to be made?\n\n491\n00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:12.990\nEverybody needs to know, okay?\n\n492\n00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:16.250\nIt's not just that one say I\njust send an email to whoever.\n\n493\n00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:20.760\nDaniel though, actually types out\non a long form and types out or\n\n494\n00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.420\nhe submits it electronically.\n\n495\n00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.830\nWe need everybody to actually\nbe able to agree to it.\n\n496\n00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.750\nWhether it's oral, email, forms,\n\n497\n00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:31.160\nwhatever it is, we should have the idea\nof what our communication channel is.\n\n498\n00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.582\nAnd also we should have\nthat formalized process,\n\n499\n00:26:34.582 --> 00:26:39.070\nas far as the result go and\nhow they're going to be communicated.\n\n500\n00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:42.000\nThe very fact is,\nif you don't see it showing up.\n\n501\n00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.500\nAs a change in the actual work breakdown\nstructure then don't worry about it.\n\n502\n00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.100\nBut there has to be some process,\n\n503\n00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:53.780\nthere has to be some way that we can\nmanage the changes that do come along.\n\n504\n00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.420\nYou still won't get every single\nchange that ends up happening.\n\n505\n00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.170\nIt's just an impossibility, okay?\n\n506\n00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:04.190\nUnless you can get everybody on\nyour side to understand that any\n\n507\n00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.070\nchange that anybody else requests,\n\n508\n00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:10.310\neven other sponsors request,\nhas to go through this formal process.\n\n509\n00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:14.000\nSomebody will still slip things in that\nyou don't realize a lot of times, and\n\n510\n00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.570\nthen you have to go back and\ntry and figure that out and try and\n\n511\n00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:20.990\nfigure out where you went over budget,\nunder budget, didn't have enough people.\n\n512\n00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:22.710\nIt all comes out in the end.\n\n513\n00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.900\nWhere that ends up happening, but\nyou'll never get a straight answer.\n\n514\n00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:29.890\nBut by having an understanding that every\nchange goes through the same process,\n\n515\n00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:31.060\nit's uniform.\n\n516\n00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.190\nIt makes it easier for\n\n517\n00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:35.850\nus to manage the entire project,\nespecially when changes come up.\n\n518\n00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:37.930\n>> Excellent points, Ronnie, all of them.\n\n519\n00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:41.050\nI know change requests\ncan be time-consuming,\n\n520\n00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:43.670\ntedious, even frustrating at times.\n\n521\n00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:46.980\nBut hopefully at the end of this show,\n\n522\n00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:52.610\nyou are seeing the importance of it, how\nit can work to your benefit in many cases.\n\n523\n00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:54.805\nEspecially when it comes\ntime to who did what wrong-\n\n524\n00:27:54.805 --> 00:27:55.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n525\n00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:58.470\n>> You're gonna love it at that point.\n\n526\n00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:59.590\nThat is that thing, right?\n\n527\n00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:01.710\nIt is an important thing,\nwe do need to engage in it.\n\n528\n00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:04.170\nRonnie's done a great job of explaining.\n\n529\n00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:08.280\nActually, all the major caveats and\nbenefits of how we use these things.\n\n530\n00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.790\nWe appreciate you doing that for us today.\n\n531\n00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:13.150\nAnd we appreciate you guys watching,\nbut we have come to the end of yet\n\n532\n00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:13.930\nanother episode.\n\n533\n00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:15.010\nHopefully you've enjoyed it.\n\n534\n00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:17.660\nWe had a great time making it for\nyou, but signing off for ITProTV,\n\n535\n00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.480\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n536\n00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.230\n>>

another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.670\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode we are still moving\n\n5\n00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.390\nforward with our Project+ series joining\nus back in the studio again today to\n\n6\n00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.300\nlend his super brain in Project,\nthat is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.520\nRonnie, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n8\n00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.620\n>> Well, thank you very much.\n\n9\n00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.910\nI don't have a super brain in Project but\nI do know a little bit about it but\n\n10\n00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.930\nwelcome to off course\nthe Comp IT ProTV show\n\n11\n00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.040\nas we continue to make sure you\nare ready not only for that exam,\n\n12\n00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.000\nmaking sure you get all the knowledge\nthat you need there, but also if you\n\n13\n00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.350\nare someone that is actually interested in\nlearning more about project management.\n\n14\n00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.050\nIf you are actually trying to not only\nget that project plus certification, but\n\n15\n00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.680\nof course if you actually are all ready in\nproject management you may want to learn\n\n16\n00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.840\nmore about the tools that\nare available to you and\n\n17\n00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.030\nthat's what we'll be\ntaking a look at today.\n\n18\n00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.080\nNow, we've already been\ngoing through the series and\n\n19\n00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.680\nwe are really kind of starting to\nget the ball rolling, the snowball\n\n20\n00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.150\nrolling down the hill, the build up\nof knowledge in terms of planning.\n\n21\n00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.650\nSo, in that planning stage, we've really\nstarted taking a look, of course,\n\n22\n00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.920\nat the project scope and managing that\nproject scope we also took an episode or\n\n23\n00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.590\nso and took a look of course at how that\nwork break down structure ends up working\n\n24\n00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.950\nfor us and now we're beginning and we're\nnot gonna tell you we're covering every\n\n25\n00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.880\nthing that there is but we're actually\ngetting in to really the heart and\n\n26\n00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.470\nsoul of the project management which\nis the idea of scheduling, okay.\n\n27\n00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.520\nNow when it comes down to scheduling the\nautomatic thing that we always think about\n\n28\n00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.750\nis essentially calendar and time, and\nthat's really what we're focusing in on.\n\n29\n00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.070\nBut most of us understand how to keep\na calendar, right, you probably have one,\n\n30\n00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.190\nI know Daniel probably has one\nwith little kittens up there.\n\n31\n00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.150\nAnd you know you flip the months and.\n\n32\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.750\n>> It's at my desk.\n\n33\n00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.070\n>> Yeah, it's at your desk.\n\n34\n00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.560\nSo that way you can actually keep\ntrack of different things that happen.\n\n35\n00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.600\nBut overall though,\n\n36\n00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.860\nright, that is actually a very important\nelement to the idea of project management.\n\n37\n00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.550\nBecause, remember that, every single\nproject is actually constrained by what\n\n38\n00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.430\nwe call our project constraints.\n\n39\n00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.550\nWe talk about the idea of cost,\nquality and\n\n40\n00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.350\ntime is what we really focus in around and\nso a whole third of what you do as\n\n41\n00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.060\na project manager is all about managing\nthe time that you have on that project.\n\n42\n00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.890\nThe time itself, if we overemphasize it,\nends up costing us in quality, or\n\n43\n00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.410\nends up costing us, of course, in money.\n\n44\n00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.870\nAnd so we've gotta actually be very\ngood at actually understanding\n\n45\n00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.440\nhow in the world we manage time and\nwhat goes into the elements\n\n46\n00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.750\nof being able to manage the time\nthat we're given for our project.\n\n47\n00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.330\nSo when we start to take a look at\nthe idea here of managing time.\n\n48\n00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.230\nWell we've gotta understand that there's\nactually several things that we have\n\n49\n00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.820\nto take into account\nwhen we start doing this.\n\n50\n00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.730\nOne of course is,\nhow long does it take for\n\n51\n00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.020\na individual task to actually be\nstarted and completed, as well, okay?\n\n52\n00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.280\nSo at that point, we might actually\naccept some input then from our WBS,\n\n53\n00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.580\nour work breakdown structure.\n\n54\n00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.470\nWe also of course make sure that we\nare still lines up with the scope\n\n55\n00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.770\nof the project as well,\nthere's nothing more disheartening for\n\n56\n00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.800\na project manager than to go around and\nnow get updated reports and\n\n57\n00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.330\nnow you actually take a look\nat one report that's kind of\n\n58\n00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.010\ntweaked your eye a little bit, wondering\nlike what in the world has happened here.\n\n59\n00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.540\nI don't remember this as\nbeing part of the project.\n\n60\n00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.540\nAnd now you realize that a part of your\nproject team's working on something that's\n\n61\n00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.510\noutside of the scope of your project.\n\n62\n00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.400\nAnd you just didn't actually\ntake in the count for that.\n\n63\n00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.360\nAnd that's a little bit of a sickening\nfeeling when you realize that all\n\n64\n00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.800\nyour resources right now we're\nactually at a critical stage where\n\n65\n00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.120\nwe need everybody working on the project,\nnot just part-time, but\n\n66\n00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.670\neverything that we need too.\n\n67\n00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.320\nAnd, of course, what requirements do we\nhave, as far as the usage of resources and\n\n68\n00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.460\nall those other constraints\nthat we've talked about.\n\n69\n00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.170\nSo those are kinda the basic\ninputs that go into things\n\n70\n00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.240\nwhen we have to consider\nmanaging time in our project.\n\n71\n00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.380\nIf it's just about you scheduling\nyour day, it's no big deal.\n\n72\n00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.780\nIf you're like me you kind of open\nup your Google calendar and go yeah,\n\n73\n00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.600\nDaniel wants us to have\na meeting about this.\n\n74\n00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.900\nAnd when do we like to have meetings,\nduring lunch.\n\n75\n00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.230\nCuz we get to eat and\ntalk at the same time.\n\n76\n00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.170\nI know that that's when I would\nschedule meetings, but overall though,\n\n77\n00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.690\nthat's something that's actually great.\n\n78\n00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.800\nBut when you start talking about managing\ntime and getting things scheduled for\n\n79\n00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.290\nyour project, though,\nthis takes a bit more consideration and\n\n80\n00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.570\na lot more elements need\nto be considered here.\n\n81\n00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.200\nAnd we go beyond the idea of\nbringing a pen and a paper or\n\n82\n00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.530\neven just a calendar into the mix here.\n\n83\n00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.640\n>> So Ronnie, we're talking more\nof a formalization of the schedule\n\n84\n00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.650\nto make sure that it is on lockdown\nthat we have try to account for\n\n85\n00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.390\nevery bit of the time that we're gonna\nneed for the project, put that in a, okay,\n\n86\n00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.490\nfrom this date to this date we are gonna\nbe working on this part of the project,\n\n87\n00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.210\nand then moving forward from there and\ncontinue to account for\n\n88\n00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.440\nthose types of time.\n\n89\n00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.970\nBut that being said,\nwe're trying to formalize that.\n\n90\n00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.130\nWhat is the best way to go about that?\n\n91\n00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.720\n>> Well the best way to at least\nget a general start to things\n\n92\n00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.430\nespecially when we start laying\nthings down for the progress.\n\n93\n00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.080\nThe over all things that we need to do so\n\n94\n00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.490\nthat we can have our project\nbe succesful at the end.\n\n95\n00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.140\nIs to understand where do\nwe need to schedule to,\n\n96\n00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.050\nin other words what's gonna be the length\nand duration of our schedules and\n\n97\n00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.750\nhow do we know that we're actually marking\nprogress and in project management terms,\n\n98\n00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.620\nwhat we do is we set up what we\ncall milestones along the way.\n\n99\n00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.500\nAnd then we start trying, from those\nmilestones, to be able to put into,\n\n100\n00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.670\nof course, the progress that\nhelps us to meet that milestone.\n\n101\n00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.840\nSo let's take, for an example,\nlet's just take a duration, right.\n\n102\n00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.670\nLet's say that you know that you\nhave six months to complete whatever\n\n103\n00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:49.400\nthis project is.\n\n104\n00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.380\nI'm not even gonna make up something\nthat's gonna be fake cuz it's gonna sound\n\n105\n00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.055\nfake if I do.\n\n106\n00:05:53.055 --> 00:05:56.240\n[LAUGH] So let's say that you\nhave six months to finish.\n\n107\n00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.060\nWell, if you know what your\nproject scope is, right,\n\n108\n00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.240\nyou know what the product is supposed\nto be, then that means what you can do\n\n109\n00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.670\nis say, here's what the first\nthing I know I need to accomplish.\n\n110\n00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.560\nIf I want this thing to\nactually happen at the end.\n\n111\n00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.820\nYou might actually say, all right,\nif I take six months of time,\n\n112\n00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.030\nI know I'll have about six weeks, or\nfive weeks or so, in between this and\n\n113\n00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.410\nthe time that I actually finish here,\nthat I need to set up milestones.\n\n114\n00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.060\nYou might say that your first big\nmilestone is coming up with some type\n\n115\n00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.070\nof prototype.\n\n116\n00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.730\nSo it might be six weeks from now.\n\n117\n00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:28.310\nThen the second six weeks, you might say,\n\n118\n00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.360\nI need to make sure that I'm not only\ntesting the prototype itself, but\n\n119\n00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.030\nI'm actually starting to think\nabout testing, or beginning\n\n120\n00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.330\nthe software development of that,\nsince I have the prototype after that.\n\n121\n00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.680\nAnd then that third milestone might\nbe testing both prototype and\n\n122\n00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.010\nsoftware together.\n\n123\n00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.090\nAnd then, yes, you bring everything to\na close here or in the last six weeks.\n\n124\n00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.300\nTry and make sure that you actually\nwrap up any other things that you have.\n\n125\n00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.460\nSo when we talk about the idea\nof milestones as far as project\n\n126\n00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.420\nplanning goes, you have to take in to\nconsideration then what you're planning.\n\n127\n00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.810\nMilestones, essentially,\nare markers inside of our entire schedule.\n\n128\n00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.980\nWhich we don't give any duration to.\n\n129\n00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.790\nIn other words, it's just the idea\nthat we get to that point and\n\n130\n00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.950\nnow we actually are saying,\nhere is the milestone that we set so\n\n131\n00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.600\nthat we know that we're\nactually going the right way.\n\n132\n00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.740\nWe're actually making progress\nthrough our project here.\n\n133\n00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.140\nSo, normally when you start\ntalking about the basics here\n\n134\n00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.290\nof just beginning to figure out\nhow to schedule It's not that\n\n135\n00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.880\nyou're trying to schedule every minute of\nthe day, but that becomes a micro manager.\n\n136\n00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.270\nIt's that you know that you have to\nget to this point in so much time and\n\n137\n00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.550\nthat's what you actually\nschedule in between.\n\n138\n00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.920\nAnd you make your work packages\ntake you from the beginning\n\n139\n00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.780\nall the way up in that first milestone and\nonce that milestones met,\n\n140\n00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.820\nyou do the same thing from one milestone\nto the next, to the next to the next.\n\n141\n00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.468\nSo you're not trying to build\nthe whole thing at one time.\n\n142\n00:07:51.468 --> 00:07:54.614\nYou're actually trying to build\nall the pieces that in the end,\n\n143\n00:07:54.614 --> 00:07:57.128\neverything is gonna set up\nthe way that you want to.\n\n144\n00:07:57.128 --> 00:08:00.047\nSo you want to begin with\nthat type of concept, and\n\n145\n00:08:00.047 --> 00:08:03.020\nthere's no real graphic\nto show you on this.\n\n146\n00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.240\nIt's just the idea that you understand,\nthat if you don't know where else to\n\n147\n00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.590\nbegin, set up milestones along the way,\nand\n\n148\n00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.790\nthen say, anything I can do to get this\nfirst milestone, and then start planning,\n\n149\n00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:17.650\nanything that I now have in this first\nmilestone, get to the second milestone.\n\n150\n00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.540\nAnd you continue on.\n\n151\n00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.820\nSo you do at least need to do that, and\n\n152\n00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.980\nmilestones can also be\nsomething special for us too.\n\n153\n00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.050\nAnd we'll probably talk about it a little\nmore in depth about that later on.\n\n154\n00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.070\nBut if you think about\nthe idea of milestones, and\n\n155\n00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.000\nwhy this is actually\nsomething that is achievable,\n\n156\n00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.720\nand why we might do this, is because\nremember that as you try to schedule along\n\n157\n00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.258\nthis particular path that we're\ntalking about milestone to milestone.\n\n158\n00:08:40.258 --> 00:08:45.910\nLet's say that what Daniel says is this,\nRonnie, I liked your milestones here.\n\n159\n00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:50.170\nBut this is such a big task, that we need\nto actually do some contingency here,\n\n160\n00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.590\nin which we say,\nif you do not accomplish this milestone,\n\n161\n00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.890\nRonnie, in the first six weeks,\nwe need to have a meeting of whether or\n\n162\n00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.230\nnot we're gonna continue this project,\nokay?\n\n163\n00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.570\nAnd so that now becomes,\n\n164\n00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.450\nyou may hear the term in other\nproject management tools here.\n\n165\n00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:09.260\nYou may hear the term project gate or\ngo-no-go decisions as well.\n\n166\n00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.710\nSo you may actually see that\nhappening with the milestones too.\n\n167\n00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.180\nSo that way you know that hey,\nhere it is, I'm six weeks into it.\n\n168\n00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.640\nDid I achieve the milestone?\n\n169\n00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.250\nWell Daniel now says, you're at the mile\nstone, Ronnie tell me you achieved it.\n\n170\n00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.780\nI go I can't, and now Daniel says, we'll\nit's time for us to call a meeting, cuz\n\n171\n00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.220\nwe need to actually decide whether or not\nwe're willing to spend money, on something\n\n172\n00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.790\nyou're obviously at the first mile stone\nRonnie, not actually on track for.\n\n173\n00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.450\n>> Yeah and the great thing about\nmilestones is they give, you and\n\n174\n00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.840\nyour team a really good,\nit's the goal to shoot for.\n\n175\n00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.830\nIt's not the entirety of the project.\n\n176\n00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.800\nBut it's a little something\nthat they can reach out and\n\n177\n00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.000\nactually tangibly kind of grabble,\nat least in a certain way.\n\n178\n00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.817\nThey say we have achieved this much.\n\n179\n00:09:50.817 --> 00:09:53.780\nAnd you do get a good sense of\naccomplishment, which helps the morale on\n\n180\n00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.540\nthe team, the projects moving forward,\nwe're accomplishing the goals that we have\n\n181\n00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.680\nset out,\nthat means everything is working smoothly.\n\n182\n00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.370\nSo milestones are one of the best\nthings you can do for your project and\n\n183\n00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.660\nyour project team, to help them stay\nmotivated to continue onto the project,\n\n184\n00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:12.200\nand for your stakeholders, people that\nhave a vested interest in that project,\n\n185\n00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.070\nto see that you are achieving\nwhat you've set out to do.\n\n186\n00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:19.610\nThey have a confidence in you, and your\nability to continue on with that project,\n\n187\n00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.223\nthat way we don't get,\nwhat Ronnie was talking about.\n\n188\n00:10:21.223 --> 00:10:24.180\nWhere they're, we gotta go or no-go on\nthis because you're not really hitting\n\n189\n00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.300\nyour numbers, or whatever the case is.\n\n190\n00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.940\nNow, Ronnie, that being said,\nyou said there's no real\n\n191\n00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.210\ngraphic that we can look at to\nthink of the idea of milestones.\n\n192\n00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.920\nBut that doesn't mean that there's\nnot a graphic, that we can look at,\n\n193\n00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.670\nwhen it comes to the idea\nof the schedule in general.\n\n194\n00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.050\nRight, whenever we start\ntaking a look at this, right?\n\n195\n00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.020\nAnd we start talking about\nthat idea of scheduling,\n\n196\n00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.580\nthere's multiple ways you can do it.\n\n197\n00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.720\nAnd that again comes down to your\npersonality, and what you choose to.\n\n198\n00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.400\nI know project managers, today,\n\n199\n00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:55.430\nthat still work off of buying that big\ngigantic calendar, that fits on the desk.\n\n200\n00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.910\nAnd that they can actually scratch\nall over and flip the pages over.\n\n201\n00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:02.510\nOr they just want that\neasel with the white pages,\n\n202\n00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.258\nthat you can actually flip over at\nthe back of the board, and mark it up.\n\n203\n00:11:05.258 --> 00:11:09.150\nBut some things are actually\na little bit more impressive,\n\n204\n00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:14.200\nI should say is what they are, in, which\nyou can actually enter the information in.\n\n205\n00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.520\nAnd all that stuff is actually\ndeveloped for you, in front of you.\n\n206\n00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.260\nAnd what I'm talking about now, is some\ntype of project management relation\n\n207\n00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:28.770\nsystem, or what we call the idea of\nthe information system, right, the PMIS.\n\n208\n00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:33.410\nNow, it's funny, okay, because this is\nwhere, and this is just a side note.\n\n209\n00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:37.840\nAnd you'll find this a little bit funny,\nI think you will, is that\n\n210\n00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.860\nin the older PMP version that was out\nthere, the PMBOK that was out there,\n\n211\n00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:47.200\nthey used to call this PMS for\nproject management software.\n\n212\n00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.060\nYou can imagine after a while,\n\n213\n00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:55.080\nwhen project managers would talk about\nwell, my project management software,\n\n214\n00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:59.670\nusing the abbreviations here,\nthat kind of got on their nerves.\n\n215\n00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:00.569\n>> I'm sure female project\nmanagers love [CROSSTALK].\n\n216\n00:12:00.569 --> 00:12:03.330\n>> It was probably not exactly great.\n\n217\n00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:07.830\nBut yeah, just a little bit aside, so,\nin the newer editions of the PMBOK, you\n\n218\n00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:13.900\nactually see them call them PMI, Project\nManagement Information System instead.\n\n219\n00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.498\nAnd what is that system about?\n\n220\n00:12:15.498 --> 00:12:19.030\nIt's software that helps you to be\non manage a project by doing this?\n\n221\n00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:24.551\nInstead you having to bring out a\ncalendar, to be able to manage a schedule,\n\n222\n00:12:24.551 --> 00:12:30.610\nand then trying to keep some type of\ncontact, or, phone book, what, directory.\n\n223\n00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.501\nI was trying to think\nof what's it's called.\n\n224\n00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:33.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Directory.\n\n225\n00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.570\nPhone book, everybody's like what\nthe heck's a phone book now?\n\n226\n00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.250\nA directory of some sort,\n\n227\n00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.090\nas well as actually trying to keep\nsome type of budget management system.\n\n228\n00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:46.510\nWell, most of these particular types of\nproject management information systems,\n\n229\n00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:50.820\nthey come bundled together, where we can\nmanage all three of them at one time, and\n\n230\n00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.430\nactually have them integrate,\nand work well together, okay?\n\n231\n00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:58.310\nSo the way we actually use something like\nthis, does take a little bit of training.\n\n232\n00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:02.510\nAnd there is plenty of training out there,\nso don't overlook that type of training.\n\n233\n00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.390\nBut I wanted to show you\nan example of one of these, and\n\n234\n00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.420\nwhat we're actually talking about here.\n\n235\n00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.600\nSo that you can see what happens.\n\n236\n00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.380\nCuz you're likely to actually encounter\nsomething that looks very similar to this.\n\n237\n00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.870\n>> I just realized PMIS isn't much better,\nRonnie\n\n238\n00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:16.825\n>> No, it really isn't.\n\n239\n00:13:16.825 --> 00:13:18.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n240\n00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.810\nit's the change that they\nthought would help them out.\n\n241\n00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.480\n>> You'll never forget it,\nthough, will you?\n\n242\n00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.155\n>> No, you will not.\n\n243\n00:13:23.155 --> 00:13:24.170\n>> [LAUGH] Bill to pneumonic.\n\n244\n00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.850\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it does tend to not work itself\n\n245\n00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:29.345\nout, the way that they thought\nit did at the beginning.\n\n246\n00:13:29.345 --> 00:13:30.560\nAnd of course everybody would do that.\n\n247\n00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.280\nBut after awhile you could see why\npeople would end up complaining.\n\n248\n00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.120\nSo right here what you\nsee in front of you,\n\n249\n00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.170\nright, is actually that type of system.\n\n250\n00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.010\nNow, this one's called Microsoft Project.\n\n251\n00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:42.930\nAnd I'm using the 2013\nversion as a demo trial here.\n\n252\n00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.480\nSo that we can actually see,\n\n253\n00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:50.120\nhow most project managers today might\nactually use a tool like this to begin.\n\n254\n00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:55.030\nSo when we start talking about scheduling,\nthe funniest thing is, especially\n\n255\n00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:58.110\nwith something like project, you really\ndon't have to begin with a calendar.\n\n256\n00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.170\nAll you need is actually a start date,\nokay?\n\n257\n00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:01.270\nThat's all you need.\n\n258\n00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.970\nYou just need to be able to plug\nin any date that you actually\n\n259\n00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.340\nknow that the project is going to begin.\n\n260\n00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:10.680\nAnd that's the only time, you actually\never have to worry about a date, okay?\n\n261\n00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.100\nSo you might say, well,\nRonny, how do you know that,\n\n262\n00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.200\nif you're scheduling out things to go?\n\n263\n00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.860\nIt's because the actual system\nitself will start doing it for you.\n\n264\n00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.340\nSo it's actually very nice when you\ncan actually use something like this,\n\n265\n00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.070\nwhen you take a look here.\n\n266\n00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:26.610\nSo by taking a look at a couple\nof different elements here.\n\n267\n00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.340\nWe have a charting system\nover here on the left hand.\n\n268\n00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.630\nLet me kind of zoom out just a little\nbit so we can see everything.\n\n269\n00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:33.810\nOver here on the left hand side,\n\n270\n00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:37.180\nyou can actually see where we have\nwhat looks like a spreadsheet, right?\n\n271\n00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.030\nYou actually have a task name,\n\n272\n00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:44.420\nwhich would essentially break down to our\nwork breakdown structure types of tasks.\n\n273\n00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.540\nAnd then you have the duration,\n\n274\n00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.790\nhow long do we believe that this\nis actually going to happen?\n\n275\n00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:52.130\nAnd the only thing that we would normally\nhave to choose when we're using a system\n\n276\n00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:57.690\nlike this, is actually going to be, that\nvery first start date that you have right\n\n277\n00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:03.000\nthere, and once you choose that, and\nthen you choose a duration, okay?\n\n278\n00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.337\nIn other words, you enter in how\nlong you believe that this is gonna,\n\n279\n00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:06.930\nactually this should be task one.\n\n280\n00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:10.220\nSo let's say on task number one here,\ncuz this is a summarization.\n\n281\n00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:14.815\nOn task number one, you believe is\ngonna start on this day, Friday,\n\n282\n00:15:14.815 --> 00:15:16.660\nFebruary 2, okay?\n\n283\n00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.410\nWell if you believe that's gonna happen,\nand then you believe that,\n\n284\n00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:22.490\nthat first task is gonna take two days,\nthe good thing is,\n\n285\n00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:26.580\nwith this type of system, all that happens\nis after you enter in that duration,\n\n286\n00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:31.610\nit automatically calculates that finish\ndate is what you'll end up seeing, okay?\n\n287\n00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:32.310\nNow, you might say, well,\n\n288\n00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:36.870\ntwo days from Friday all the way through\nuntil Monday, well, this is something\n\n289\n00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:40.920\nelse that the system allows you to be able\nto take a look at and do as well, okay?\n\n290\n00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.287\nThe very fact of what this system does,\n\n291\n00:15:43.287 --> 00:15:46.659\nis it says look I take into\naccount standard work weeks,\n\n292\n00:15:46.659 --> 00:15:51.848\nwhich means Monday through Friday, five\nday work week, Saturdays and Sundays off.\n\n293\n00:15:51.848 --> 00:15:56.484\nSo if this task took two days of duration,\nthat means Friday and\n\n294\n00:15:56.484 --> 00:15:58.848\nthen Monday, is what it means.\n\n295\n00:15:58.848 --> 00:16:03.091\nTwo whole days, and\nthat's why you saw where the actual\n\n296\n00:16:03.091 --> 00:16:07.750\ntask itself starts on Friday and\nends on Monday, okay?\n\n297\n00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:11.770\nSo you'll see strange things like that\nif you're not used to actually using\n\n298\n00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.170\nsome type of project management system.\n\n299\n00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:17.010\nNow what you're normally used to counting,\nwhat I'm normally used to counting\n\n300\n00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:22.360\noutside of the project management system,\nright, is what we call elapsed time, okay?\n\n301\n00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.730\nSo in all reality, right,\n\n302\n00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.970\nwhat were we talking about as far as\nthe overall duration of task number one?\n\n303\n00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:34.080\nWell from Friday you go Friday,\nSaturday, Sunday and Monday.\n\n304\n00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.140\nSo we're talking about\nfour days of elapsed time.\n\n305\n00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:41.950\nBut the actual work on the project\nitself though happened on Friday and\n\n306\n00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:42.940\nhappened on Monday.\n\n307\n00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.390\nSo you'll actually see that.\n\n308\n00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:49.380\nThe good thing is if I were having\nto do this by hand Daniel, And\n\n309\n00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:53.240\nactually bring out a calendar and\nDaniels says all right two days and\n\n310\n00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.098\nwe're gonna begin a project on Friday\nwhich is silly, but you can do it.\n\n311\n00:16:57.098 --> 00:17:00.880\nIf you wanna begin a project on Friday and\nthere's a two day duration,\n\n312\n00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:04.420\nwell you'd have to actually go,\nokay I'm going to start here on Friday,\n\n313\n00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.870\nmake sure I skip Saturday and\nSunday and then start on Monday again.\n\n314\n00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:09.680\nOkay and that's perfectly fine.\n\n315\n00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.750\nYou can do that manually if you want to.\n\n316\n00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:16.620\nBut using a system like this, that\nautomatically calculates it out for you.\n\n317\n00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:19.510\nReally makes the project\nmanagement a lot easier.\n\n318\n00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.320\nNow, not only can we do stuff like that,\nbut\n\n319\n00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:24.700\nlets take a look at the right hand\nside over here, just a little bit.\n\n320\n00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:29.540\nI'll try and scroll in, and\nsee if I can move over, there we go, okay.\n\n321\n00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.910\nNow, this is something that you\nmight not have seen before.\n\n322\n00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:36.510\nIt's what we call the idea of a Gantt\nchart, if you wanna call this here.\n\n323\n00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.660\nAnd this is a graphical display\nof the overall duration and\n\n324\n00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:41.770\nthe tasks that we have in front of us.\n\n325\n00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:48.290\nSo these bars here represent the time\nelement that you see right here, okay.\n\n326\n00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:51.320\nNow you'll actually see a little\ncalendar system up above it\n\n327\n00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.970\nwhere do you see the idea of Friday and\nthen that's actually a Sunday.\n\n328\n00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.050\nAnd notice it actually\nskips every other day.\n\n329\n00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:00.960\nSo F represents Friday and then you\nskip Saturday and then S is Sunday.\n\n330\n00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.180\nNotice that Monday is not showing up and\nessentially the task begins, or\n\n331\n00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.580\nthe next task actually begins\non Tuesday there the T.\n\n332\n00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.060\nWell, notice that they're showing\nthe two-day duration on that task.\n\n333\n00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.880\nAnd that's what that bar\nrepresents right there,\n\n334\n00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.670\nwhich is a task that actually stands for\ntwo days.\n\n335\n00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.160\nIf I hover over it,\nit tells me right there the task and\n\n336\n00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.380\nits duration and the start and\nfinish date, too.\n\n337\n00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:28.810\nSo that's a lot of elements that a project\nmanager needs to be able to have on hand\n\n338\n00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.800\nif he's actually asked about or\n\n339\n00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.050\nif he actually needs to know,\nwhen does task number two really begin.\n\n340\n00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.650\nWell, he need to know when this task ended\n\n341\n00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:41.000\nmaybe before the next one begins as well,\nokay.\n\n342\n00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.510\nNow, you'll also end up seeing\nthat there's a couple of\n\n343\n00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:48.200\ndifferent elements here that don't\nreally show up graphically very well but\n\n344\n00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.080\nyou'll notice that there's\nkinda this black diamond.\n\n345\n00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:54.280\nLet me zoom back out and kinda refocus\nin just a little bit more here.\n\n346\n00:18:54.280 --> 00:19:00.510\nAnd so right next to where I have that\nlittle finger icon that's showing up,\n\n347\n00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.900\nyou actually see these\nblack diamonds here, and\n\n348\n00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:07.260\nthis is actually set up as what we call\na milestone inside of Microsoft Project.\n\n349\n00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:12.150\nThere is no duration to this task, it is\nessentially a date marker that says look,\n\n350\n00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.400\nwhen these first two tasks are done,\nthis is our milestone,\n\n351\n00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.190\nokay, this is where we\nactually said we should be.\n\n352\n00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:22.090\nSo that way, you start planning this stuff\nout, even before anything happens here,\n\n353\n00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:23.640\nyou say here it is.\n\n354\n00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.543\nWhen I finish these two and let\nMicrosoft Project calculate it all out,\n\n355\n00:19:27.543 --> 00:19:30.260\nI can go set a milestone\nthat says here it is.\n\n356\n00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.720\nI've met my milestone,\nor I didn't meet it, and\n\n357\n00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.650\nyou didn't really have\nto actually do anything.\n\n358\n00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:38.000\nThe schedule marks it out for you, and if\nI can continue to go to the right a little\n\n359\n00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.880\nbit you can actually see there's\nanother milestone down here.\n\n360\n00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.380\nSo that way you can keep track of them.\n\n361\n00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:47.360\nAnd that's why we talk about\nthe scheduling between the milestones here\n\n362\n00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.780\nto give us that ability to move from\none to the next step to the next step.\n\n363\n00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:56.010\n>> Now Ronnie, real quick question\nhere about the milestone portion is if\n\n364\n00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:59.800\nwe get done or we get up to the milestone\nit says it should have taken you up to\n\n365\n00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.270\nthis certain amount of time to get to this\nmilestone, and say we did it quicker.\n\n366\n00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:07.900\nDo we then move the milestone or\ndoes that re-adjust our schedule,\n\n367\n00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.110\nat least as far as the project\nmanagement system goes?\n\n368\n00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.920\n>> Yeah, in the project management system,\n\n369\n00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.910\nthe milestone itself doesn't\naffect the overall schedule.\n\n370\n00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:18.550\nThere are things that we can put in\nplace that will affect the schedule, but\n\n371\n00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:22.420\nthe idea of the milestone is exactly that,\nis that if you finish it faster,\n\n372\n00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:26.530\nit shows in comparison to that milestone\nthat you're ahead of schedule.\n\n373\n00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:30.210\nIf you finish later than that,\nit shows you're behind schedule.\n\n374\n00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.040\nAnd that normally means\nsome type of decision or\n\n375\n00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.640\nsome type of gate move that\nneeds to be done here.\n\n376\n00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.140\nAnd again, everybody uses different terms.\n\n377\n00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.440\nWe use milestones in Microsoft Project,\nyou may use the term go no-go, you may use\n\n378\n00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.510\nthe term project gate, phase gate task\ngate, whatever you wanna call it.\n\n379\n00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:49.540\nYou may actually hear all that\ndifferent terminology, but\n\n380\n00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.270\nusually in that Gantt\nchart it shows up there.\n\n381\n00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:55.580\nAnd the reason why project\nmanagers love this is because,\n\n382\n00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:59.140\nwithout having to go into the other\nside of it where they show every detail,\n\n383\n00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:03.990\nthey can pretty much look at that chart\nand know that on that particular date\n\n384\n00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:07.930\nwhere they're supposed to be\nalong the project itself, right?\n\n385\n00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:11.220\nSo, you would actually will\nend up seeing that, too.\n\n386\n00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:15.320\nNow, the other thing that the actual\nchart says, let's just go back to this in\n\n387\n00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.400\na moment, right now, and\nlet me see if I can zoom in just a little.\n\n388\n00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.750\nI'm gonna kind of reduce that and\n\n389\n00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.230\nwe're gonna take a look at this\nportion a little bit more.\n\n390\n00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:27.270\nNotice that what we have here\nare also little tiny arrows\n\n391\n00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:31.810\nthat essentially connect\nthe actual task together.\n\n392\n00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:37.980\nAnd those arrows are actually signifying\nsome type of dependency that we have.\n\n393\n00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:40.680\nNow, for getting ready for, of course,\n\n394\n00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:45.270\nthe CompTia project plus exam, you need\nto know about really two generic types,\n\n395\n00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.640\nactually three generic types\nof these dependencies.\n\n396\n00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.970\nI wanna make sure I told you them right.\n\n397\n00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:54.060\nYou need to know about what is\ncalled a mandatory dependency,\n\n398\n00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:58.070\nyou also need to know about what is\ncalled a discretionary dependency.\n\n399\n00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:02.960\nAnd then lastly what we call\nan external dependency as well, okay.\n\n400\n00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.530\nNow what is that dependency about?\n\n401\n00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.440\nAnd then we'll go back and\nwe'll define these terms, okay.\n\n402\n00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:12.400\nWhen we start talking about the idea\nof the dependency, task number one,\n\n403\n00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.280\nokay, in the way that is\nactually linked here,\n\n404\n00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:19.190\nin what we see is that we're saying\nthat the complete task number one\n\n405\n00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:25.460\nhas to be completed before\ntask number two begins, okay.\n\n406\n00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.590\nNow that makes logical sense.\n\n407\n00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.240\nBut in the project management world,\n\n408\n00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.850\nthe way that you say it's\na little bit backward, okay.\n\n409\n00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:35.440\nAnd I don't know why they do this.\n\n410\n00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:39.200\nIt's always about the idea\nof the dependency right?\n\n411\n00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.410\nSo in other words what they\nnormally say is task number two,\n\n412\n00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:51.460\nthe beginning of task number two depends\non the completion of task number one.\n\n413\n00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.580\nNow you might say, well, that doesn't\nreally make much of a difference.\n\n414\n00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.790\nYou're right, it doesn't.\n\n415\n00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.320\nBut it's the way that you hear it said and\n\n416\n00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.780\nthe way that you also read\nabout it a lot of times.\n\n417\n00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.610\nWhen you start looking, cuz you'll\nprobably go well, it seems simpler to say\n\n418\n00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:05.320\nthat task number one has to finish\nbefore task number two begins.\n\n419\n00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.570\nAt least to me it is.\n\n420\n00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:10.840\nRather than saying the start of task\nnumber two depends on when task number\n\n421\n00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:11.910\none finishes.\n\n422\n00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:12.855\nLittle bit of a tongue twister.\n\n423\n00:23:12.855 --> 00:23:14.070\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I totally agree.\n\n424\n00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:16.700\nBut the idea is pretty basic,\nit's pretty simple.\n\n425\n00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:19.760\nWhat they're saying is you can't put\nthe chocolate chips in the cookie\n\n426\n00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.370\nunless you've actually\nmade the cookie dough.\n\n427\n00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.590\nSo task number one,\nmake the cookie dough and\n\n428\n00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.660\nthen when that task's completed\nyou can start on task number two.\n\n429\n00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.840\nThat's the idea,\nI totally I agree with Ronnie,\n\n430\n00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.300\nsometimes these things\nsound a little more a,\n\n431\n00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.840\na little more complicated than they\nneed to be, to be honest with you.\n\n432\n00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.120\nBut that is the idea they're\ntrying to drive home.\n\n433\n00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.520\n>> Yeah and so\nnow you have to also make this decision\n\n434\n00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.690\nespecially when you're starting\nto plan these things out.\n\n435\n00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:47.880\nIs that what we talk up task\nnumber two can't begin until task\n\n436\n00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.090\nnumber one finishes.\n\n437\n00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:53.900\nIs that a mandatory dependency,\nis it a discretionary dependency?\n\n438\n00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.738\nOr is it some type of external dependency?\n\n439\n00:23:55.738 --> 00:23:58.068\nWell, this is how you tell the difference,\nokay.\n\n440\n00:23:58.068 --> 00:24:01.178\nA mandatory dependency is actually\ndependent on the process.\n\n441\n00:24:01.178 --> 00:24:04.268\nIn other words,\ndid what the example that Daniel gave us.\n\n442\n00:24:04.268 --> 00:24:07.377\nRight?\nThat the cookie dough has to kind of be\n\n443\n00:24:07.377 --> 00:24:12.940\nmade up, completed before we add\nin those chocolate chips there.\n\n444\n00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.825\nWell yeah, that actually sounds\nlike a mandatory dependency,\n\n445\n00:24:15.825 --> 00:24:20.850\ncuz if I just add in the chocolate\nchips along with just the flour itself.\n\n446\n00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:25.170\nAnd then I might eventually make\nthe cookie dough at some point but\n\n447\n00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.180\nnormally that's what the process is right?\n\n448\n00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:32.000\nSo what we're saying is if a process has\nto be completed, before we can actually\n\n449\n00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.760\never begin on that second process, that's\nwhat you call a mandatory dependency.\n\n450\n00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:41.010\nBut there are times though that we\nhave what we call a discretionary\n\n451\n00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:42.560\ndependency as well.\n\n452\n00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.700\nNow this type of discretionary\ndependency is actually\n\n453\n00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:49.070\nwhat we call procedure driven or\npolicy driven.\n\n454\n00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:53.850\nNow Daniel, I had a friend that actually\nused to make cabinets on high end jets.\n\n455\n00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:57.900\nSo in other words her was brought in to\nmake these cabinets and make look good.\n\n456\n00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.050\nAnd they were fantastic.\n\n457\n00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:04.460\nHe said the problem wasn't that you had to\nmake them, it's the problem that you had\n\n458\n00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:08.640\nto do was actually wait in between time,\nthat everything had to be inspected.\n\n459\n00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:14.800\nAll the components had to be inspected\nfirst and then once you measured them out\n\n460\n00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.970\nand you installed them,\nthen those components had to be inspected.\n\n461\n00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.860\nThen they had to go back and\ncheck all of your measurements and\n\n462\n00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.640\nsize of the plane versus\nwhat you actually had.\n\n463\n00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.870\nAnd then after the installation\nhad to be inspected again.\n\n464\n00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:27.690\nOkay.\n\n465\n00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:31.490\nSo he said that the majority of his\nwork wasn't actually very difficult.\n\n466\n00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.510\nHe could make the cabinets about a day,\nbut it normally took about\n\n467\n00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:38.600\nthree to four days because every\nstep he had to stop along the way.\n\n468\n00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.590\nAnd wait for that inspector to come\nback in and measure everything.\n\n469\n00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:46.430\nWell that's more of a procedural\ndependency, you're not waiting for glue to\n\n470\n00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:51.480\ndry, you're not waiting for somebody else,\nactually in a mandatory dependency.\n\n471\n00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.750\nYou're waiting for someone else to\nfinish whatever else he needs to finish.\n\n472\n00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:59.620\nBut in this instance, you're really just\nwaiting for the inspector to say okay.\n\n473\n00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.830\nAnd then he goes and\nchecks on something else and\n\n474\n00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:04.770\nnow he goes to a different part of\nthe plane to check on something.\n\n475\n00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:07.190\nWhat if you finished that and\nNick's like, no no no just wait here.\n\n476\n00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.640\nAnd he goes, no I've got\nsomething else I need to inspect.\n\n477\n00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.820\nIt could be two hours.\n\n478\n00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:11.920\nIt could be four hours.\n\n479\n00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.500\nIt could be a day before he comes back to\ntake a look at your next part of the work.\n\n480\n00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.250\nYou install that and then you come\nback and go, he's gone again.\n\n481\n00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:21.290\nWell that again is a discretionary\ntype of dependency.\n\n482\n00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:25.990\n>> It sounds like that's almost like\npart of the tasks, where you have, okay,\n\n483\n00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:29.590\nI'm the cabinet maker,\nI make the cabinet and that's my task.\n\n484\n00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:32.980\nAnd then kinda the next task is\nsomeone coming by an inspecting it and\n\n485\n00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:37.060\nmaking sure that it is to\nthe specifications that they require.\n\n486\n00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:37.970\nAnd then once that's done.\n\n487\n00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:41.530\nSo it's almost like adding tasks,\nat least in a sense.\n\n488\n00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:42.850\n>> There is.\nYeah, you are.\n\n489\n00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:44.810\nYou're adding in and extra level there.\n\n490\n00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:46.370\nBut you do,\nyou have to work through those, right.\n\n491\n00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:48.640\nThat's a highly regulated industry.\n\n492\n00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.590\nYou don't just go,\nI'm a great cabinet maker.\n\n493\n00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:52.270\nI wanna make it for these planes.\n\n494\n00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.300\nAnd you can say I want to make\nthe cameras the way I want to and\n\n495\n00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.070\nI want to install them when I want to.\n\n496\n00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.985\nBecause of how, I guess,\ndangerous the plane,\n\n497\n00:26:58.985 --> 00:27:02.200\nthat they want to make sure\nthe materials aren't super flammable.\n\n498\n00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.640\nThey want to make sure that they're\nactually going to be the way that they\n\n499\n00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.850\nneed to be inside of that plane.\n\n500\n00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:13.891\nAnd that's why he loved the job, but he\nsaid it was so frustrating that he would\n\n501\n00:27:13.891 --> 00:27:17.580\ndo a task and you'd make something like,\nlet's say a single cabinet.\n\n502\n00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.200\nRight?\n\n503\n00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:18.840\nYou'd make that.\n\n504\n00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.600\nAnd you might be sitting there for\nfour hours.\n\n505\n00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.000\nYou might be sitting there for six hours.\n\n506\n00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.967\nAnd then they'd inspect it,\ntell you, you can install it now.\n\n507\n00:27:25.967 --> 00:27:27.460\nAnd then you install it.\n\n508\n00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.111\nAnd then you're waiting another six hours.\n\n509\n00:27:29.111 --> 00:27:30.447\n>> [CROSSTALK] You're\nwaiting another eight hours.\n\n510\n00:27:30.447 --> 00:27:31.062\nYeah.\n\n511\n00:27:31.062 --> 00:27:31.852\nAnd that's what he says.\n\n512\n00:27:31.852 --> 00:27:34.590\nHe said a lot of it was just reading\nin between until it was done,\n\n513\n00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.030\nbecause it's not like\nhe could line them up.\n\n514\n00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:41.980\nAnd six planes being made, it's like you\njust had to work on one plane at a time.\n\n515\n00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.830\nAnd he said it wasn't frustrating,\nthere was a lot of free time.\n\n516\n00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:45.170\nIt was great pay, that's what he told me.\n\n517\n00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:49.220\nIt was great pay, but at the same time you\ncan see where that's a dependency that\n\n518\n00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.930\nreally doesn't actually come\nalong with the task itself,\n\n519\n00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:57.370\nbut actually is an extra\nstep like you said there.\n\n520\n00:27:57.370 --> 00:28:00.230\nAnd of course there's always\nexternal dependencies, too.\n\n521\n00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:06.500\nAnd the idea of this external dependency\nis that there is some outside factor that\n\n522\n00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:11.410\nyou might end up seeing that really does\neffect the way that your schedule goes.\n\n523\n00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:16.240\nSo you can imagine that Daniel says\nwe're gonna have brand new servers.\n\n524\n00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.470\nGreat, okay.\n\n525\n00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:19.460\nSo Daniel goes ahead and\nhe orders those servers.\n\n526\n00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.520\nHe goes to the vendor of choice.\n\n527\n00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.620\nHe says, here's the beefy servers I want.\n\n528\n00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:27.130\nAnd they say, absolutely we'll\nget it to you as soon as we can.\n\n529\n00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:30.710\nAnd Daniel now says okay,\nso should be here when?\n\n530\n00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:34.400\nWell, our delivery's not\nactually that great.\n\n531\n00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.050\nWell, when is it gonna be there?\n\n532\n00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:38.030\nWell, we believe it's\ngonna be there next week.\n\n533\n00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:41.140\nNext week comes, they're not there, okay?\n\n534\n00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.170\nWell, when can you get it here?\n\n535\n00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.440\nWe'll get it there as soon as we can.\n\n536\n00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.930\nYou can imagine now that Daniel's\nready to install the servers.\n\n537\n00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:48.540\nHe's ready to get everything in.\n\n538\n00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.380\nEverything's actually ready to go.\n\n539\n00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.710\nBut what is he waiting on?\n\n540\n00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:54.680\nNot that they're not made because\nlook we've shipped them out.\n\n541\n00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.420\nIt's actually up to the delivery guys.\n\n542\n00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.180\nAnd maybe the deliveries\nare an external factor\n\n543\n00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.550\nthat is now what we're dependent on.\n\n544\n00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:03.340\nWe're waiting on that task\nto finish in it's delivery,\n\n545\n00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:08.070\neven though the servers are complete,\nDaniel's ready to go, it's the delivery.\n\n546\n00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:09.660\n>> Yeah, the outside factor.\n\n547\n00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.450\nThat's the key right there.\n\n548\n00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:15.720\nIt's something that's outside\nthe control in your sphere.\n\n549\n00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.300\nIt could be just that\nthey're horrible at shipping.\n\n550\n00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:22.330\nThat's a possibility and you'll mostly\nlikely find another vendor at that point.\n\n551\n00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.590\nBut what if it's something\nto the effect of,\n\n552\n00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:28.990\nit was on the plane bringing it here and\nthe plane crashed.\n\n553\n00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:31.020\nOr the truck or the train derailed.\n\n554\n00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.440\nThat's something that happens.\n\n555\n00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:35.830\nA horrible thing but it is something\nthat occurs outside of our control.\n\n556\n00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:37.070\nWe could not stop that.\n\n557\n00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:40.500\nMaybe a tornado went through\nthe plant that we're building it,\n\n558\n00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:45.130\nand now I've got to wait until they can\nretool or start up their disaster site.\n\n559\n00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:46.880\nTo get back to work.\n\n560\n00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:47.870\nI still have to wait, right?\n\n561\n00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:49.460\nThese are things that\nwe cannot account for.\n\n562\n00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:50.500\nWe can't control.\n\n563\n00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.230\nThese are external things.\n\n564\n00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:53.960\nHence the term, external.\n\n565\n00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:54.490\n>> Yeah.\nAnd\n\n566\n00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:58.490\nwhen you start seeing things like this,\nas far as those dependencies, that end up\n\n567\n00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:02.440\ndelaying our project for one way or\nanother actually cause this, you do have\n\n568\n00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.400\nto account for them in your project plan\nas well, and sometimes this can be done.\n\n569\n00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.710\nYou can imagine that if you're ready to do\nsome thing and you're ready to go, but yet\n\n570\n00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:14.020\nyou've hired a subject matter\nexpert to come in and help you, and\n\n571\n00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:17.270\nthen they get sick and say, look I\ncan't get on the plane until next week.\n\n572\n00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:19.530\nWell even that time has\nto be accounted for.\n\n573\n00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:23.556\nBut the great thing is you can actually\nsplit that task where you say we're ready\n\n574\n00:30:23.556 --> 00:30:25.250\nto contact and we're ready to go, but\n\n575\n00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:28.330\nthe actual beginning of that\ntask is gonna be delayed.\n\n576\n00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:31.900\nAnd that way with this type of project\nmanagement information system, you can\n\n577\n00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:36.540\nactually see what it actually delays in\nthe remainder of your project to get done.\n\n578\n00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.720\nAnd that way you can start\ntaking a look at further and\n\n579\n00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.800\nfurther down the line on resources,\nhow you can reschedule them.\n\n580\n00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.950\nMaybe if you can, you might be able to\nfill in some task between the time that\n\n581\n00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:49.260\nyou're waiting, or you might actually end\nup figuring out something that you can do\n\n582\n00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:54.360\nsome things at the same time, and\nstart working them out, but overall, just\n\n583\n00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:59.490\nat least understanding the basic types of\ndependencies there are gonna help you out.\n\n584\n00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:04.280\nBut Daniel, there's a lot more to do\nwith what we call dependencies but\n\n585\n00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.900\nyou've let me talk a long time again,\nwhich means I've exhausted my time.\n\n586\n00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.050\n>> Yeah we've only got so\nmuch time for show, and\n\n587\n00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:13.980\npoor Ronnie he's got a whole lot more to\ntalk about as it comes to scheduling.\n\n588\n00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.790\nSo we're gonna have to\ndo a part two on this.\n\n589\n00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:16.450\nI look forward to that.\n\n590\n00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:17.520\nHopefully you do as well.\n\n591\n00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:21.120\nRonnie, we look forward to see you in\nthat episode to finish this up and\n\n592\n00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.220\nround out our knowledge, when it comes\nto scheduling and project management.\n\n593\n00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.390\nThat being said, let's go ahead and\nwrap up the show.\n\n594\n00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:29.770\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n595\n00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:30.500\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n596\n00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.638\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n597\n00:31:32.638 --> 00:31:40.480\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.645\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are continuing on with our\n\n4\n00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:25.160\nProject+ series, actually moving into\nanother one of our famous part twos.\n\n5\n00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.570\nJoining us back in the studio today to\nhelp round that out is our good friend and\n\n6\n00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.310\nmentor Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.670\nRonnie, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n8\n00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.230\n>> Well thank you for\n\n9\n00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.310\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\non taking a look at CompTIA's Project+.\n\n10\n00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.740\nYes, another part two and you're probably\nsaying, man, they do that on purpose?\n\n11\n00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.890\nWell sometimes we do but overall\nthough it's because one episode was so\n\n12\n00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.280\njam packed with information on a lot of\ngreat information that it did need to\n\n13\n00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.870\njust overflow into another show or\nI would continue to talk on.\n\n14\n00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.941\nAnd that's never a great thing at times,\nbut now we're actually continuing on with\n\n15\n00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:57.053\nthat same episode where we'll\ntalk about project scheduling.\n\n16\n00:00:57.053 --> 00:01:02.518\nAnd we were looking at the tool in one of\nthose PMISSD, I know it sounds strange,\n\n17\n00:01:02.518 --> 00:01:06.200\nthe Project Management Information System\nthings.\n\n18\n00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.590\nAnd we were taking a look at\nMicrosoft Project to help us and\n\n19\n00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.080\nto show you some of the utilities,\n\n20\n00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.750\nat least one of the tools that you\nmight see used in project management.\n\n21\n00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.850\nNow, when we were taking a look at\nit from a previous episode here,\n\n22\n00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.150\nlet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen,\n\n23\n00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.630\nthat way we can kind of zoom in and\nremind everyone briefly.\n\n24\n00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.540\nAs I pulled up this kind of\nvery generic project plan.\n\n25\n00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.950\nAnd what we were talking about was\nthe idea of dependencies, right?\n\n26\n00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.740\nThat there are actually different\ntypes of dependencies, like mandatory,\n\n27\n00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.680\ndiscretionary, and even external\ndependencies that we all have to take into\n\n28\n00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.580\nconsideration when we start\ncreating these project plans.\n\n29\n00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.930\nBut once we have them in our project plan\nthen, we can actually go and line them up.\n\n30\n00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.530\nThe default way that Microsoft\nworks this is fairly simple.\n\n31\n00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.100\nWe end up actually putting them\nessentially one after the other.\n\n32\n00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.210\nIn other words, task number one\nfinishes before task number two begins.\n\n33\n00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.970\nAnd then, of course, that means task\nnumber two finishes before task number\n\n34\n00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.220\nthree begins, and that's a default.\n\n35\n00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.930\nThat's the way that it's done.\n\n36\n00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.850\nBut they don't expect you\nto leave it that way, okay?\n\n37\n00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.080\nSo a lot of times what you end up\nrealizing inside of a project plan,\n\n38\n00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.060\nis that you'll take a look\nat two different tasks.\n\n39\n00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.960\nOne that happens after the other, or\nif you wanna do it the project manage way,\n\n40\n00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.350\none that happens before the other\nYou kinda get the picture.\n\n41\n00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.040\nIt's six one way, half a dozen the other.\n\n42\n00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.650\nAnd that's just one of those things\nwhere you just have to get used to\n\n43\n00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.780\nthe terminology.\n\n44\n00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.400\nBut what you might end up finding\nout is that even though one task\n\n45\n00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.370\ncan finish before the other one begins,\nyou can also find out that maybe I can\n\n46\n00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.890\nstart essentially both\ntasks at the same time.\n\n47\n00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.440\nOr both tasks can complete\nat the same time,\n\n48\n00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.790\nthereby shortening the duration\nof the overall project schedule.\n\n49\n00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.670\nNow we want to talk about that factor now,\nso that we can take a look here.\n\n50\n00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.440\nSo let's take a look here, here's\nthe default that I was talking about.\n\n51\n00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.960\nIf you take a look at this project plan.\n\n52\n00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.620\nYou can see where task number\none essentially goes ahead and\n\n53\n00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.820\ncompletes, then task number two begins,\ntask number two completes and\n\n54\n00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.880\nthen task number three begins.\n\n55\n00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.200\nAnd it continues to go on and on and on,\nand right here at the last one there's no\n\n56\n00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.480\nlinking to that task and\nthat's why we don't see that.\n\n57\n00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.970\nNow, when we take a look at that,\n\n58\n00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.260\ncuz that's actually to be announced\nhere If I select both of those tasks.\n\n59\n00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.150\nTask seven and eight.\n\n60\n00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.830\nI can then.\n\n61\n00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.570\nLet me see if I can do this.\n\n62\n00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.910\nI can actually right click and\nthen I can link them together.\n\n63\n00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.830\nIf I can actually see it here.\n\n64\n00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:32.630\nAt some point.\n\n65\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.400\n>> Put your cheaters on.\n\n66\n00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.390\n>> Let me see here.\n\n67\n00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.550\nYeah, let me see if I can\nactually link that up.\n\n68\n00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.100\nHere, in the correct way.\n\n69\n00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.840\nSo I can actually come down here and say\nto task number twelve, and there we go.\n\n70\n00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.580\nNow I've actually linked\nthose two together.\n\n71\n00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.180\nActually it looks like\ni did the wrong one.\n\n72\n00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.990\nThat's what I need to do.\n\n73\n00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.520\nSee I even had the wrong one there, so\nthat actually links to task number eleven.\n\n74\n00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.100\nIs what needs it.\n\n75\n00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.870\nThere we go.\n\n76\n00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.630\nSo notice how that particular task,\n\n77\n00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.110\nif I can actually pull in a little bit,\nyou can now see where that pushed it out\n\n78\n00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.580\nto the very end once again extending out\nthe overall duration of that project.\n\n79\n00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.060\nSo we can go ahead and\nlink those together and\n\n80\n00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.890\nnow Microsoft Project knows\nhow to deal with them,\n\n81\n00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.450\nbut what you have to worry about though is\nthe very fact that manually, you need to\n\n82\n00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.450\nunderstand how that works and what\nhappens there, so let me show you here.\n\n83\n00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.100\nSo let's say that what we have here\nis a representation of the task\n\n84\n00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.370\non my Gantt chart and\nthe ways that we can link them together.\n\n85\n00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.920\nNow this is you logically having to deal\nwith the different tasks that are actually\n\n86\n00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.860\nin front of you, or work packages,\n\n87\n00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.900\nwhatever you want to call them and\nso here is the standard ways.\n\n88\n00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.770\nAnd there's actually four ways that you\nmight see that you might do this, okay.\n\n89\n00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.980\nThe default is this finish to start, and\nthe way that you can tell this inside of\n\n90\n00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.000\nthe Gantt chart is that over here on the\nleft hand side this represents the start\n\n91\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.120\nof a task, over on the right hand\nside it represents the finish or\n\n92\n00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.430\nthe completion of a task as well.\n\n93\n00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.800\nAnd this is the only one in which,\nwhen you take a look at it,\n\n94\n00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.680\nit actually finishes and then it links and\na lot of the time it links right here to\n\n95\n00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.820\nthe top of the task for\none reason or another.\n\n96\n00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.730\nBut inside of Microsoft Project,\nyou actually see this one right here,\n\n97\n00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.760\nit's really tiny.\n\n98\n00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.870\nI'll see if I can zoom in for us here.\n\n99\n00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.760\nYou can see even right there\nwhere it actually does do it\n\n100\n00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.600\nright at the very beginning, but notice\nit links it really to the very top there.\n\n101\n00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.190\nSo you will see things like\nthat where you'll see that.\n\n102\n00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.780\nAnd that's actually a visual\nrepresentation that lets you know that\n\n103\n00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.360\nthose two,\nat least from the way that we have it,\n\n104\n00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.960\nwe're saying that task number one has to\nfinish before task number two begins.\n\n105\n00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.070\nBut remember what I said.\n\n106\n00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.780\nYou might end up finding out that\nyou have two tasks that are actually\n\n107\n00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.230\ndone sequentially this way\naccording to Microsoft Project but\n\n108\n00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.350\nyou realize then that they can\nactually start at the time.\n\n109\n00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.270\nSo let's go back and\ntake our example of something like\n\n110\n00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.900\na finishing of the building of a house,\nright.\n\n111\n00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.070\nSo let's say that we complete\nthe actual structure of the house and\n\n112\n00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.470\neverything's ready to go, but there's\nalso landscaping that we want to do.\n\n113\n00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:04.440\nAnd so what we might see in a regular\ntask in a project plan is that\n\n114\n00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.310\nwe finish the actual house and it's ready\nto go, and then we start the landscaping.\n\n115\n00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.240\nBut in our reality,\n\n116\n00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.860\nDaniel, if we think about it, couldn't\nwe possibly do one of two things here?\n\n117\n00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.030\nCouldn't we actually say that\nwhat we wanna do is that\n\n118\n00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.800\non the last week of that house finishing\nup, before we turn over the key and\n\n119\n00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.330\neverything else,\nthat we start landscaping.\n\n120\n00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.950\nWe could start them both at the same time\nif we actually wanted to and say this.\n\n121\n00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.990\nEven more logical would be say\nthe day that we turn over the key\n\n122\n00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.630\nIt's a day that we also finish.\n\n123\n00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.570\nIn other words, when we finish\nbuilding and constructing the house,\n\n124\n00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.650\nturn the key over, is also the day\nthe landscaping finishes instead.\n\n125\n00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.830\nSo let's take a look at my diagram again.\n\n126\n00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.110\nSo either one of those is\nactually two great possibilities.\n\n127\n00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.500\nIf I wanted to say that we finish, and\nlet's say, just painting the garage, or\n\n128\n00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.400\nwe start painting the garage on the same\nday that we start the landscaping.\n\n129\n00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.430\nWe could do something like that.\n\n130\n00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.810\nMakes it very easy.\n\n131\n00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.470\nAll you do is you actually go into Project\nand you can actually change that link, but\n\n132\n00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.340\nyou have to understand\nwhat it is you're doing.\n\n133\n00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.130\nAnd that's why we're\nshowing it to you here.\n\n134\n00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.560\nSo this is the graphic\nway you would do it.\n\n135\n00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.680\nYou would just simply draw an arrow\non the start and start side.\n\n136\n00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.000\nIf you wanna do what I talked about\nearlier here where you're saying\n\n137\n00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.870\nWhen we finish painting\nthe interior of the house,\n\n138\n00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.480\nwe wanna make sure that the landscaping\nfinishes at the same time.\n\n139\n00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.400\nNotice that we're coming from the finish\nside and we're linking those two together.\n\n140\n00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.700\nThose two elements belong together.\n\n141\n00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.240\nAnd so when you do that, instead of\nactually having them stack end to end,\n\n142\n00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.000\nwhich is what we see in\nthe finish to start,\n\n143\n00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.250\nwe now essentially shortened the duration.\n\n144\n00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.722\nSo you might find out that that\nlast bit of painting, let's say for\n\n145\n00:07:38.722 --> 00:07:43.256\nexample takes two days, but the landscape\nis going to take, let's say, three days.\n\n146\n00:07:43.256 --> 00:07:48.741\nSo you might see something that is a\nlittle bit funny as far as the bars go and\n\n147\n00:07:48.741 --> 00:07:52.653\nrepresenting the duration,\nso you might see that.\n\n148\n00:07:52.653 --> 00:07:56.163\nNow, the weirdest thing and,\nat least to me,\n\n149\n00:07:56.163 --> 00:07:59.225\nthe most ironic thing, as one of these.\n\n150\n00:07:59.225 --> 00:08:02.995\nYou normally do not see\na dependency like this,\n\n151\n00:08:02.995 --> 00:08:06.360\nin which you talk about a start to finish.\n\n152\n00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.640\nNow I actually did this\na little bit backward here.\n\n153\n00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.500\nSo this was supposed to\nlink the start side.\n\n154\n00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.080\nSee, I did the arrows\nbackward is what I did.\n\n155\n00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.550\n>> It's so counter-intuitive for you.\n\n156\n00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.570\n>> It did not, yeah, it really is.\n\n157\n00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:21.060\nSo, let me see if I can relink\nthis the way that it needs to be.\n\n158\n00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:21.632\nWhich is here.\n\n159\n00:08:24.665 --> 00:08:26.560\nYeah, this is really fun.\n\n160\n00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.900\nLet me see.\nLet me try to regrab this.\n\n161\n00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:29.930\nThis is gonna be great fun.\n\n162\n00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.350\nLook at that,\nthat actually keeps creating more.\n\n163\n00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.500\nThere we go, that's starting to get there.\n\n164\n00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.660\nIt takes a little bit more time.\n\n165\n00:08:41.024 --> 00:08:44.280\nMan it's like-\n>> It's just hideous.\n\n166\n00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.600\n>> Yeah, I think that's actually bad.\n\n167\n00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.724\n>> I think this train's\nderailed there [LAUGH].\n\n168\n00:08:47.724 --> 00:08:50.550\n>> It is, but it looks like I'm\nfinally gonna grab the last one.\n\n169\n00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.960\nThere we go, that is terrible.\n\n170\n00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.540\n>> It ain't pretty but\nit got the job done.\n\n171\n00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.880\n>> It ain't pretty but there we go.\n\n172\n00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.440\nSo, you actually see where\nnow the start of one task,\n\n173\n00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:05.160\nwhich is normally the predecessor, means\nthat the second task ended up finishing.\n\n174\n00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.110\nNow you normally don't see\nvery much of this type.\n\n175\n00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.160\nI'll tell you the truth,\n\n176\n00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.500\nI don't think I've ever seen it in\nan actual project plan before but\n\n177\n00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.850\nit does give you that ability to say\nthat the start of the predecessor\n\n178\n00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:23.210\nindicates that the dependent\ntask has actually finished.\n\n179\n00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.249\nSo go figure, you might actually\nend up seeing something like that.\n\n180\n00:09:26.249 --> 00:09:30.070\nI can't even tell you of\na great example of this.\n\n181\n00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.560\nAnd you can go out and look for examples,\n\n182\n00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.820\nbut none of the examples that you normally\nsee even make any type of remote sense.\n\n183\n00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.470\nSo what you tend to deal\nwith a lot of times,\n\n184\n00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.520\nI'm gonna say in all reality, right?\n\n185\n00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.900\nFinish to Start, Start to Start,\nFinish to Finish.\n\n186\n00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.110\nSo when you do see this on a Gantt chart,\nwhether it's written out or whether you're\n\n187\n00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:51.700\nseeing it inside of something like\nMicrosoft Project, Projectlibre, anything\n\n188\n00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.380\nelse, Primavera, whatever you might see\nit in, what you're having to actually\n\n189\n00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.240\ndeal with is understanding how they are\nactually linking these things together.\n\n190\n00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.410\nThe overall goal of changing\nthese dependencies is\n\n191\n00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:07.740\nessentially to shorten the overall\nduration of the project itself.\n\n192\n00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.350\nAnd that's why we might choose\nto do something like this.\n\n193\n00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.120\nAnd to make sure that we\nlogically can actually\n\n194\n00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.750\nsee how things are actually\ndesigned to be scheduled together.\n\n195\n00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:21.480\nSo now if you change it from a Finish\nto Start, add to a Start to Start,\n\n196\n00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.450\nyou're realizing that means you\nhave to go and call the landscaper.\n\n197\n00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.790\nAnd go whoa, wait a minute,\nI know I had you starting on the 13th but\n\n198\n00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.840\nit looks like you need to start on 9th and\nsee if they can do so.\n\n199\n00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.900\nAnd you might even change\nit if they say no.\n\n200\n00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.630\nSo in other words,\n\n201\n00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:38.770\nyou might have realized you can't change\nit because it's on scheduling and that's\n\n202\n00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:43.270\nwhen we start going to outside types of\ndependencies that we have to worry about.\n\n203\n00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:46.890\nOr is this a discretionary dependency or\nis it a mandatory, that's when you have to\n\n204\n00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:50.120\nstart trying to realize what is\nactually gonna end up happening.\n\n205\n00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.570\nSo understanding at least the layout here,\nbesides this last one, in which I terribly\n\n206\n00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:59.420\nmangled here like crazy, and I'm gonna\nmangle it even more by doing this.\n\n207\n00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.270\nBut you can see that this is something\nthat you don't really want to\n\n208\n00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.710\never see happen but\nyou do see it every once in awhile.\n\n209\n00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.180\nBut not in anything that\nwe would normally do.\n\n210\n00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.713\nYou might see it in physics or\nsomething, that's the only thing I know.\n\n211\n00:11:13.713 --> 00:11:15.940\n[LAUGH] It's more of a chemical process.\n\n212\n00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.890\n>> Yeah, crazy, logical, or\nstuff that doesn't typically happen.\n\n213\n00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:24.690\nIt would be in just a very\nminute sector of the field.\n\n214\n00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:25.200\nNormally, though,\n\n215\n00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.160\nyou're gonna see the first three\ntypes that Ronnie is talking about.\n\n216\n00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.820\nAnd it does look a little confusing,\neven with the Start to Start and\n\n217\n00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.770\nthe Finish to Finish, and\nyou're thinking, okay.\n\n218\n00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.960\nYou just gotta remember what is\nsimultaneously happening, and\n\n219\n00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.020\nthat should help you remember and\n\n220\n00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.670\ndetermine what those task relationships\nactually are trying to accomplish.\n\n221\n00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:48.598\nNow that being said Ronnie,\nnow we can move into developing\n\n222\n00:11:48.598 --> 00:11:53.500\nthe critical path of our project and\nour tasks.\n\n223\n00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.490\n>> Right.\nWhen you start taking a look here,\n\n224\n00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:58.530\nonce you actually get all\nof your tasks lined up\n\n225\n00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.720\nyou have to determine something\nthat we call the critical path.\n\n226\n00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.140\nNow, when we start talking\nabout the critical path well,\n\n227\n00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.175\nwhat are we really referring to?\n\n228\n00:12:06.175 --> 00:12:09.690\nWell, we're normally referring to when\nwe take a look at the critical path,\n\n229\n00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:14.550\nis what is gonna be the longest\nduration that we can actually complete.\n\n230\n00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:19.510\nTask one after the other, to get to the\nend point and there's no, what we call,\n\n231\n00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:20.930\nfree time in between, or\n\n232\n00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:26.490\nfloat is what you tend to hear, going on\nSlack, you may hear that term as well.\n\n233\n00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:30.410\nSo we need to determine\nthe longest uninterruptible path\n\n234\n00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:34.120\nthrough our entire project plan\nonce we get everything lined up.\n\n235\n00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.380\nNow you might be going well, isn't\nthere only one path through a project?\n\n236\n00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.370\nNo, you might end up finding\nout that you have a project\n\n237\n00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:45.220\nthat ends up having subprojects\ninside that end up doing other things\n\n238\n00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.390\nthat end up really changing what\nthat critical path is gonna be.\n\n239\n00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.370\nSo that's what we need to determine\nonce we lay out everything,\n\n240\n00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.250\nwe need to be able to\ndo something like this.\n\n241\n00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:59.470\nNow, when you tend to see something like\nthe idea of determining critical path,\n\n242\n00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:03.010\nlet me show you a type of diagram\nthat it ends up looking like.\n\n243\n00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:07.216\nI just saw Daniel's eyes go bink,\n[LAUGH] do that number.\n\n244\n00:13:07.216 --> 00:13:08.186\n>> I'm scared Ronnie.\n\n245\n00:13:08.186 --> 00:13:09.630\n[LAUGH]\n>> It does,\n\n246\n00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:14.730\nit looks a little bit overwhelming\nhere when you start to take a look.\n\n247\n00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:19.060\nBut what we're actually seeing\nhere is on the left hand side,\n\n248\n00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:23.630\nbeginning with task number one,\nwe might find\n\n249\n00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:28.100\nout that we actually do end up splitting\ninto two different paths here.\n\n250\n00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.500\nOne path going from A, B,\n\n251\n00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:35.070\nC, D, all the way to I,\nleads us all the way to the end as well.\n\n252\n00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:40.530\nWe might also end up seeing that we\nhave something else along our particular\n\n253\n00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:47.640\nproject line as well where we go from A to\nE to F to G to H and then to I instead.\n\n254\n00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.890\nAnd when you take a look at both of them,\nyou need to determine which of these two\n\n255\n00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:56.490\npaths have no float time, or no idea of\n\n256\n00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:01.450\nfree time in between them, and that way\nyou actually end up learning something.\n\n257\n00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.970\nThe overall goal is to determine\nthat critical path because\n\n258\n00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:10.340\nanywhere along the line that you and\nI delay that critical path,\n\n259\n00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:14.350\nit will end up delaying and\nchanging the finish time to our project.\n\n260\n00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:19.800\nAnywhere that we have float time we can\ndelay it within the amount of time that we\n\n261\n00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.560\nhave free play, and it's not gonna delay\nthe overall finish of the project.\n\n262\n00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.520\nSo that's why it's actually very\nimportant for us to determine this, so\n\n263\n00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.060\nthat we know that if we actually hit\nthat part of the schedule which says\n\n264\n00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:39.540\nany part of this particular plan,\nright here during this duration.\n\n265\n00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.870\nIf we have any delays,\nwe know that the project finished date\n\n266\n00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:47.830\nis gonna get exploded out,\nit's not going to finish on time.\n\n267\n00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:49.459\nSo that's why we need to term this.\n\n268\n00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.920\nSo when we start to take a look at this,\nhow in the world do we do this?\n\n269\n00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.280\nWell let me show you.\n\n270\n00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:00.050\nSo what I've done here is I've zoomed\nin on one of these particular work\n\n271\n00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.320\npackages here.\n\n272\n00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.170\nAnd so normally you might end up\nwith something that looks fairly\n\n273\n00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:04.870\nsimilar to this.\n\n274\n00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:08.060\nNow, if you're drawing this out,\nyou don't have to be this detailed, but\n\n275\n00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.140\nusually it's actually a rectangle or\na square and\n\n276\n00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.230\nyou end up just writing\nthe task name in the middle.\n\n277\n00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:16.170\nAnd you can make these little boxes, but\n\n278\n00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:18.730\nit's really the positioning that\nyou need to pay attention to.\n\n279\n00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:22.360\nES stands for early start.\n\n280\n00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.800\nEF stands for early finish.\n\n281\n00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.740\nLS stands for late start.\n\n282\n00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.370\nLF stands for late finish.\n\n283\n00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.220\nThe D here is duration, and\n\n284\n00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:34.970\nnow normally you don't see a lot of\npeople list the idea of float here.\n\n285\n00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:38.761\nBut I just did it to make it sure that was\ngraphically clear that what we want to\n\n286\n00:15:38.761 --> 00:15:41.307\ndetermine is if there is\nfloat time in between, and\n\n287\n00:15:41.307 --> 00:15:43.519\nwe'll show you how that's actually done.\n\n288\n00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:48.604\nSo the way that this ends up working out\nthen is that when we start a project,\n\n289\n00:15:48.604 --> 00:15:54.121\nwe've got to actually be able to realize\njust a couple of different things here.\n\n290\n00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:58.127\nSo let's take a look at this one for\nexample.\n\n291\n00:15:58.127 --> 00:16:00.887\nAnd what we start off with\nhere is task number 1.\n\n292\n00:16:00.887 --> 00:16:05.660\nAnd notice that right here in\nbetween the A and Float here.\n\n293\n00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.290\nLet me hit the right one.\n\n294\n00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:10.560\nWe end up seeing this 1\nright here that indicates\n\n295\n00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.988\nthe overall duration of a task, okay?\n\n296\n00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:18.380\nSo oops, let me hit the right key,\nthat helps out a little bit.\n\n297\n00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.210\nSo how does this begin?\n\n298\n00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:25.370\nWell, if I have a one day duration on the\ntask, that means my earliest start time,\n\n299\n00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:32.030\nor earliest start date, is gonna be well,\nright here which is gonna be 1 here, okay.\n\n300\n00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:38.110\nSo if I wanted to calculate the duration\nof this particular work package,\n\n301\n00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:43.040\nright, I have a single day, my first day.\n\n302\n00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.900\nAnd I'm saying that it lasts\nthe entire duration of that day.\n\n303\n00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:52.190\nSo my earliest finish is\nactually gonna be that day.\n\n304\n00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.350\nBecause I'm counting what,\nthat full eight hour work day?\n\n305\n00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.000\nIf I work that full eight hour work day,\nam I still on the same day?\n\n306\n00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.160\nYeah, okay, so there is day number 1.\n\n307\n00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:06.550\nNow, that means that if I finish that\neight hour work day on day number 1,\n\n308\n00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:12.801\nthat means for task B, the earliest\nday that I can begin is day 2, okay?\n\n309\n00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.995\nNow, this is where the counting, again,\n\n310\n00:17:15.995 --> 00:17:18.700\nyou have to kinda realize\nwhat they're saying.\n\n311\n00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.606\nIf I have a 2-day task duration,\nthat means on the 2nd,\n\n312\n00:17:22.606 --> 00:17:27.807\nif you wanna actually match it up to\na date, right, that's 1 of the 2 days.\n\n313\n00:17:27.807 --> 00:17:33.360\nAnd then the 3rd would actually\nbe the 2nd day, so there it is.\n\n314\n00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.430\nYou count day number 2 and\nday number 3 and\n\n315\n00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:40.270\nthat is now a 2-day task duration,\nand notice that.\n\n316\n00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.990\nNow if you actually look at it,\nit looks like a 1, okay.\n\n317\n00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.700\nBut overall though,\nyou're counting what, that same day.\n\n318\n00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:49.960\nYou're counting that 2nd day and\nthat's what leads you to the 3rd.\n\n319\n00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:54.390\nAnd so that means for\n\n320\n00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:59.640\ntask C, the earliest thing they\ncan do is being on what, day 4.\n\n321\n00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.570\nAnd now I have a 4-day task duration.\n\n322\n00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:06.540\nSo if we were trying to say,\nlet's do it from January 1st, right?\n\n323\n00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.750\nOr January 4th.\n\n324\n00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:12.441\nSo I would count January 4th,\nJanuary 5th, January 6th,\n\n325\n00:18:12.441 --> 00:18:16.420\nJanuary 7th, well that's 4 days, okay?\n\n326\n00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:20.645\nSo my earliest finish then\nwould be at the end of day 7.\n\n327\n00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.910\nAnd that means that on task D here,\nthe same thing,\n\n328\n00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:31.370\nthe earliest date then that I could\nstart on that other task is task 8.\n\n329\n00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:36.378\nSo I actually have to count the 8th, the\n9th, and the 10th if I were to do that.\n\n330\n00:18:36.378 --> 00:18:40.970\nAnd kinda realize that that would actually\nmean that the earliest finish date we\n\n331\n00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:44.230\nwould do, or the earliest day we would do,\nwould be 10 days later.\n\n332\n00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.460\nNow we're not gonna complete this yet,\n\n333\n00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.960\nbecause notice that I have this\nalternate path down here, okay?\n\n334\n00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.330\nSo even though, in theory, we would\nthink that task I would begin at 11,\n\n335\n00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:00.010\nwe need to take into account,\nnow that we see two different paths here,\n\n336\n00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:03.150\nwhat is gonna be this finish date instead.\n\n337\n00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:07.780\nSo now if we do the same thing, the\nearliest start date for this one is gonna\n\n338\n00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:13.150\nbe 2, and then when you actually have\n1-day duration, that's really day 2 again.\n\n339\n00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:16.380\nSo this one finishes, oops, here on 2,\n\n340\n00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.840\nand that means the earliest\nthat this one can begin is 3.\n\n341\n00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:27.250\nSo then we have 5 days, 3rd,\n4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th, here.\n\n342\n00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.820\nSo this one finishes, oops, on the 7th.\n\n343\n00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:34.300\nAnd that means the earliest\nhere is gonna be 8.\n\n344\n00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:38.474\nAnd this one has a 4-day task, 8th, 9th,\n\n345\n00:19:38.474 --> 00:19:42.558\n10th, and 11th, so this is the 11th.\n\n346\n00:19:42.558 --> 00:19:46.135\nAnd then this one, again,\nbegins on the 12th here, and\n\n347\n00:19:46.135 --> 00:19:50.810\nthen it's a 1-day duration,\nwhich means it finishes also on the 12th.\n\n348\n00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:57.380\nNow that you have the earliest finish\ndates for this path up here, the 10th,\n\n349\n00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:04.030\nand the earliest one for this down\nhere on the 12th, well, guess what?\n\n350\n00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:05.850\nOnly one of those can actually be valid.\n\n351\n00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:10.147\nAnd since we're trying to determine\nthe longest uninterrupted path,\n\n352\n00:20:10.147 --> 00:20:11.936\nthat means that we actually,\n\n353\n00:20:11.936 --> 00:20:16.510\nthe earliest thing that task I can\nbegin with is gonna be the 13th.\n\n354\n00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.630\nSo even though this one\nfinishes on the 10th,\n\n355\n00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:25.415\nI really can't do anything between them, I\nhave to pick the longest date here, right?\n\n356\n00:20:25.415 --> 00:20:30.961\nAnd so this one begins on the 13th\nwith 1 day duration, that's 14.\n\n357\n00:20:30.961 --> 00:20:33.880\nAnd that's the way that we actually begin,\nokay?\n\n358\n00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.240\nSo when you take a look\nat that particular idea,\n\n359\n00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:42.110\nthat is what you're looking at as far\nas what we call that early pass or\n\n360\n00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:46.520\nthat forward pass going\nthrough our project, okay?\n\n361\n00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:51.420\nNow the good thing is, if we can determine\nsomething like that, that also means\n\n362\n00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.940\nthat here on the very last task, and we're\ngonna do what we call a backward pass\n\n363\n00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:59.910\nhere, is that the latest finish\nthat I can have is the 14th.\n\n364\n00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:03.710\nAnd then when we have that one day,\n\n365\n00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:09.350\nthe latest start that I can\nhave is the 14th on that day.\n\n366\n00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:12.350\nNow this is where\nthe numbers begin to change.\n\n367\n00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.054\nSo now notice if I take this, and\n\n368\n00:21:14.054 --> 00:21:16.906\nwe're doing what we call\na backward pass through it.\n\n369\n00:21:16.906 --> 00:21:22.971\nNow that means that the latest finish\nthat can happen if this late start here\n\n370\n00:21:22.971 --> 00:21:29.570\nis the 14th, this means that this can\nfinish on the 13th at that point.\n\n371\n00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:33.460\nAnd this one here,\nit would actually be the 13th as well.\n\n372\n00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:39.539\nSo then you start calculating\nbackwards from 13, 12, and\n\n373\n00:21:39.539 --> 00:21:43.820\nthen 11, okay, I was not able to count.\n\n374\n00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.147\nSo you can now see 11.\n\n375\n00:21:45.147 --> 00:21:48.000\nSo that means that the latest\nfinish here would be the 10th,\n\n376\n00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.671\nand then you subtract those 4 days.\n\n377\n00:21:51.671 --> 00:22:00.910\n10, 9, 8, 7 [LAUGH] my subtracting\nabilities are actually pretty bad there.\n\n378\n00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:05.790\nAnd then that means that this one will\nstart on the 6th and then we take away 2,\n\n379\n00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:10.150\nso that's the 6th and the 5th here.\n\n380\n00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:12.370\nAnd so, there you go.\n\n381\n00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:14.610\nYou actually now can determine that, and\n\n382\n00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:17.050\nyou would do the same thing\non this bottom path as well.\n\n383\n00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:21.900\nAnd so we would do the same thing,\nwhere this one now actually finishes\n\n384\n00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.860\non the 13th, and that means that\nthe latest finish here is the 12th.\n\n385\n00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:33.380\nWe again subtract out 12th, 11th,\n10th, 9th here, for the 9th.\n\n386\n00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:37.120\nAnd the latest finish on F would be 8.\n\n387\n00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:42.910\nWe subtract out the 5, right, the 8th,\nthe 7th, the 6th, the 5th, the 4th.\n\n388\n00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:50.440\nAnd then that means the latest\nfinish here would be the 3rd.\n\n389\n00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.980\nWe subtract out that 1 and\nthat's actually gonna be the 3rd as well.\n\n390\n00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:59.030\nAnd now, between the two here, okay,\nthe latest finish that I can have now,\n\n391\n00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:02.670\nnotice that there's a difference,\nright, between these two.\n\n392\n00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:06.425\nThis one would be the 4th, right,\nbecause this would be the earliest.\n\n393\n00:23:06.425 --> 00:23:12.570\nAnd then you do that, and this one as\nactually gonna be right there, okay.\n\n394\n00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:16.410\nSo, you can end up seeing where this\nbackward pass ends up finishing to.\n\n395\n00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:21.160\nNow, when we talk about the idea of\ndetermination between them then,\n\n396\n00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.790\nnotice how we can actually\ndetermine the float.\n\n397\n00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:26.210\nWe essentially take the late start,\nwe subtract out the early finish.\n\n398\n00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:28.530\nOr you can do it on the other side,\n\n399\n00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:32.750\nlate finish subtracting out\nthe early finish, okay?\n\n400\n00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:34.278\nSo remember that that's what you see.\n\n401\n00:23:34.278 --> 00:23:37.189\nSo in other words,\nI can take this number down here,\n\n402\n00:23:37.189 --> 00:23:39.910\nsubtract out this number up here.\n\n403\n00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:42.920\nOr I can take this number up here and\nsubtract that out and\n\n404\n00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.050\nlet's see what we have in practice here,\nokay?\n\n405\n00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.474\nSo normally when you start\ndoing something like that,\n\n406\n00:23:48.474 --> 00:23:51.329\nyou can actually see like right\nup here where you have the dates.\n\n407\n00:23:51.329 --> 00:23:54.213\nSo you actually take 5 minus 2,\nwhich is 3.\n\n408\n00:23:54.213 --> 00:23:57.731\nYou do the same thing over here,\nwell, that's actually equal to 3.\n\n409\n00:23:57.731 --> 00:24:02.610\nSo then there's the same thing here,\nsame thing as 3.\n\n410\n00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:05.150\nAnd then here, another one as being 3, and\n\n411\n00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:09.940\nnow notice that these numbers here,\nare also going to determine this too.\n\n412\n00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.710\nNow there's somewhere along the way\nI actually ended up doing the wrong\n\n413\n00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.560\nnumbers here, because.\n\n414\n00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.170\n>> Check your math, Ronnie.\n\n415\n00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:18.230\n>> Yep, I did not check my math.\n\n416\n00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:22.030\nAll right, so\nI did find my mathematical mistake here.\n\n417\n00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:23.710\nAnd it happened right\nhere at the very end.\n\n418\n00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:25.770\nAnd Daniel did point this out to me.\n\n419\n00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:27.010\nThat I don't know why,\n\n420\n00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:30.610\nI took the entire thing and\nI still did what I said I shouldn't do.\n\n421\n00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:33.120\nSo notice right up here I did the 13 and\n\n422\n00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.320\nthat one day duration, I turned it into\na two-day task which I should not have.\n\n423\n00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:42.350\nSo we now begin with the third teeth,\nand now we change all of this instead\n\n424\n00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.850\nto the right number, to the 13th, this\nis where we essentially add, you know,\n\n425\n00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:50.140\nsubtract out our numbers and\nthat's what we end up with here.\n\n426\n00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:54.690\nSo even this numbers are actually gonna\nbe all of by one is what happens.\n\n427\n00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:59.160\nSo this one actually turns into a 12 and\nthen this one, again,\n\n428\n00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.520\nactually turns into a 12 there\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n429\n00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.880\nSo now, this turns into a 10.\n\n430\n00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.630\nLet me remove, oop.\n\n431\n00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.066\nLet me not do that.\n\n432\n00:25:11.133 --> 00:25:12.340\nThere we go.\n\n433\n00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.980\nAnd then, that means that this path now,\nthe earliest one, is gonna be the ninth.\n\n434\n00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:21.680\nAnd that means this turns into a six and\n\n435\n00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:27.320\nthen this one turns into the fifth here.\n\n436\n00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.840\nTake out the 2,\nthis one turns into a four.\n\n437\n00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:35.155\nAll right, so that's what we should do and\nlet me remove these numbers to okay.\n\n438\n00:25:35.155 --> 00:25:38.605\nSo you actually see where one mistake\nthere and I don't know why even though I\n\n439\n00:25:38.605 --> 00:25:42.637\ndid it right the whole way at the very end\nI decided in my brain I was gonna add.\n\n440\n00:25:42.637 --> 00:25:44.307\nSo you can make mistakes like this.\n\n441\n00:25:44.307 --> 00:25:46.057\nThis is pretty much the factor.\n\n442\n00:25:46.057 --> 00:25:48.147\n>> Human beings being human, Ronnie.\n\n443\n00:25:48.147 --> 00:25:50.667\n>> Yeah,\nit's a little bit unusual that I'm\n\n444\n00:25:50.667 --> 00:25:52.217\nactually human but-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n445\n00:25:52.217 --> 00:25:53.157\n>> No, I'm fine, yeah.\n\n446\n00:25:53.157 --> 00:25:53.957\nThat actually works.\n\n447\n00:25:53.957 --> 00:25:55.617\n>> Ron is from the planet Zorkoff.\n\n448\n00:25:55.617 --> 00:25:58.737\n>> So yep, so they're, oop 87,\nthat would even be worse.\n\n449\n00:25:58.737 --> 00:25:59.747\nSo there it is.\n\n450\n00:25:59.747 --> 00:26:02.167\nI'm actually subtracting out\nthe numbers that I should be.\n\n451\n00:26:02.167 --> 00:26:04.937\nAnd what you're starting to see\nis the numbers end up lining up\n\n452\n00:26:04.937 --> 00:26:06.840\nthe way that they should,\nwhich is right here.\n\n453\n00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.850\nAnd there was one more mistake\nthat I actually did end up seeing,\n\n454\n00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:11.260\nthat I made here.\n\n455\n00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.560\nSo now notice because of the way that\nthe numbers worked out this time,\n\n456\n00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.840\nthis four actually does change.\n\n457\n00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.300\nNow, when I took a look\nat this backward pass,\n\n458\n00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:26.190\nright, the actual late date\nthat I can actually have here,\n\n459\n00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:31.320\nthe latest finish that this one can\nhave is not gonna be here because now\n\n460\n00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:36.170\nI'm starting to see that all these numbers\nare matching up and that zero that this\n\n461\n00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:40.940\nthing is actually the one the number that\nI should use as my late finish I cannot\n\n462\n00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:45.430\ndo this one up here because this path\nright here the numbers aren't matching.\n\n463\n00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:49.590\nThis right here actually tell me that look\nthere's no float here there's nothing here\n\n464\n00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.430\nSo this becomes a 1 and this becomes a 1.\n\n465\n00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:56.360\nSo we're taking this number here and\nwe're putting it here instead of the 4.\n\n466\n00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.960\nBefore I had that 5, and\neverything ended up turn on.\n\n467\n00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.340\nAnd I was like,\nwhy is that number actually wrong?\n\n468\n00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:04.050\nSo now, this is where you can go in and\nwhen we subtract\n\n469\n00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:10.530\nthat late start from the early start,\nwe get zeroes.\n\n470\n00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:13.290\nAnd so\nnow the float is actually not there.\n\n471\n00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:14.240\nSame thing here.\n\n472\n00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:18.186\nSame thing here.\n\n473\n00:27:18.186 --> 00:27:19.283\nSame thing here.\n\n474\n00:27:19.283 --> 00:27:21.540\nAnd, of course, the same thing here.\n\n475\n00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:25.950\nBut if we do this one,\nwe see that there's a float of 2.\n\n476\n00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:30.720\nAnd here you also see the same thing\nwhere you actually have a float of 2.\n\n477\n00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.910\nAnd this one again you're\nsubtracting either side right,\n\n478\n00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:38.660\nlate finish from the early finish, or\nyou know, late start from the early start,\n\n479\n00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.350\nyou're actually seeing\nthe idea of two here as well.\n\n480\n00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.590\nNow a lot of times when you start\nseeing something like this, right?\n\n481\n00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:52.020\nYou can now see where any one of these\ntasks essentially have that two day flow,\n\n482\n00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.880\nor whatever the time period is.\n\n483\n00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.680\nAnd so that means that this task\ncan possibly be delayed, or\n\n484\n00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:00.500\nany of these tasks can possibly\nbe delayed by up to two days.\n\n485\n00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.620\nAnd it's not gonna affect\nthe overall duration.\n\n486\n00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:09.760\nIf I affect anything down here, that\nultimately affects the actual task here,\n\n487\n00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:14.860\nwhich means that the ultimate duration is\ngoing to end up getting, or the ultimate\n\n488\n00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:20.460\ntask here is gonna end up getting delayed,\nand your project will be delayed as well.\n\n489\n00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.520\nNow when you take a look at this and\ntry to determine this,\n\n490\n00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.860\nwhat you're really trying to do is,\nespecially when you're preparing for\n\n491\n00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:32.800\nthe Comp T or project plus, is you wanna\nmake sure that you can identify I do not\n\n492\n00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.030\nbelieve on the CompTIA Project + they are\ngonna make you fill out the whole thing.\n\n493\n00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.000\nOkay, I don't believe it's gonna happen.\n\n494\n00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.660\nBut don't underestimate that they\nmay focus in on let's say Task D\n\n495\n00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.400\nand ask you to determine\nthings like float.\n\n496\n00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.350\nDoes this have a float?\n\n497\n00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:50.350\nDoes it not have a float?\n\n498\n00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:51.280\nWhat's the float?\n\n499\n00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.940\nWhatever it might be,\nyou might see something like that.\n\n500\n00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.920\nOr they make ask you to choose\nwhich of the following here\n\n501\n00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.050\nafter giving you all this, but\n\n502\n00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:02.140\nyou wouldn't have this bottom line here\nwhere I actually determine the float.\n\n503\n00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.490\nWhich one of these is\nactually the critical path?\n\n504\n00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:07.730\nWell it's the one that\nhas no float at all.\n\n505\n00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:10.280\nSo when you take a look what\nyou're really looking for\n\n506\n00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:14.610\nas far as a hint goes, are these numbers\nwhen I subtract them out being zero?\n\n507\n00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:15.540\nOr are they something else?\n\n508\n00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:19.150\nIf they're something else, then that's\nwhere your float is going to be.\n\n509\n00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:21.780\nSo it's a very important thing that\nyou'll have, if you're going for\n\n510\n00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:26.420\nyour PMP you'd have to at least figure\nout or know what's happening here.\n\n511\n00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.380\nBut they really do they end up\nconcentrating at one or two tasks and\n\n512\n00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:33.340\ntry to see if you can pick which\none is the critic path or not.\n\n513\n00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:36.710\nSo just make sure you can actually\ndetermine something like that and\n\n514\n00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:39.750\nnot make the mathematical mistakes\nI made is pretty much the key.\n\n515\n00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:40.510\n>> I'm the exact same way,\n\n516\n00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:43.330\nI'm horrible at math so\nI allow computers to do it all for me.\n\n517\n00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:46.900\nBut it is good to have a good\nfamiliarity with that and\n\n518\n00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.620\ntake your time if you do have\nto do something like this.\n\n519\n00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:53.440\nVerify your math, it's easy as you\ncan see to make that mistake and\n\n520\n00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.290\nthen your numbers will be completely off.\n\n521\n00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:59.040\nAnd you won't be able to get the question\nright or do the project correctly.\n\n522\n00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.030\nSo, verify your math.\n\n523\n00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:04.800\nRonnie, is there anything else that we\nneed to cover as far as the scheduling?\n\n524\n00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.160\n>> We need one more thing, okay?\n\n525\n00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.790\nWe need to actually determine what\nwe call project baselines, okay?\n\n526\n00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:11.730\nNow what in the world\nis a project baseline?\n\n527\n00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:16.230\nA project baseline is when you\nfinish all of your planning and\n\n528\n00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:21.060\nthen you're actually able to confirm,\nat least according to your plans,\n\n529\n00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:25.160\nparticular start dates and\nfinish dates of any one particular task.\n\n530\n00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.180\nNow you can actually mark one\nof those tasks and say, hey,\n\n531\n00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.530\nhere is the baseline that if\nI hit this task on this date,\n\n532\n00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:37.440\nthis is my measurement for the rest of the\nproject Which I'll compare against, right?\n\n533\n00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.920\nTo say I actually hit my dates correctly.\n\n534\n00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.400\nSo when you actually do have something\nthat's real, in other words,\n\n535\n00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.250\nyou finish completing a task,\n\n536\n00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:48.880\nyou can then compare the entire project\nversus this particular day and set it up.\n\n537\n00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.450\nSo normally it doesn't take into\naccount anything else, durations or\n\n538\n00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:52.410\nanything else here.\n\n539\n00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:56.440\nIt just says Start and finish date,\nwhat do you actually want it to be?\n\n540\n00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:01.590\nAnd that way, as your project progresses,\n\n541\n00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:05.160\nthat's really gonna tongue tie me, then\nyou can actually make a comparison to what\n\n542\n00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:08.880\nthe actual project plan looks like\nVersus the way that you planned it.\n\n543\n00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:13.000\nSo let me show you how you end up doing\nthis at least in Microsoft Project here.\n\n544\n00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.440\nSo, when I take a look at project,\nif I go up here to, let me see,\n\n545\n00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.830\nis it format or, actually, project.\n\n546\n00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:24.590\nIf I select project up here at the top,\nI can then select set baseline and\n\n547\n00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:25.640\nthen set the baseline.\n\n548\n00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.590\nAnd then when I do so,\n\n549\n00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:33.670\nit's only gonna ask me whether I wanna set\nit for, let me see if I can zoom in here.\n\n550\n00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:37.890\nWhether I wanna set it for what would\ncall the entire project itself or\n\n551\n00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:39.770\ndo I wanna set it up for select a task.\n\n552\n00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:43.610\nYou name it and\nthen from that point I simply click okay.\n\n553\n00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:49.210\nAnd then the project itself Okay,\nwill actually not mark it for\n\n554\n00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:53.000\nus as far as what we see,\nlet me see if I can scroll back up here.\n\n555\n00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.300\nWe don't tend to see a lot of marking\nhere, but in the background every change\n\n556\n00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:01.870\nthat we now make, is gonna be able to\ncompare it against the baseline, right?\n\n557\n00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:04.810\nThe plan as we think is perfect, okay?\n\n558\n00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:06.450\nSo that's what you're doing.\n\n559\n00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:06.990\nLater on,\n\n560\n00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:10.320\nas you get more involved you might\nfind out that the original plan is so\n\n561\n00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:14.680\nchanged now that you really can't compare\nit to that anymore because you did.\n\n562\n00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.330\nYou added in so many changes.\n\n563\n00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:20.690\nWell then, at that point you might hear\nabout what we call interim baselines, in\n\n564\n00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:24.880\nwhich you go, yeah here's where the last\ntime our project was really stable and\n\n565\n00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.020\nwe'll compare it against that instead.\n\n566\n00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:30.070\nSo that's what you're really\ndoing is you're setting those and\n\n567\n00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:33.160\nthen later on when you run reports\nagainst something like this,\n\n568\n00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.630\nyou can now actually show somebody,\nhere was the original project.\n\n569\n00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:41.300\nHere's where we are by comparison and then\nthey can overlay them if they want to or\n\n570\n00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:45.450\ndo a manual comparison and that way\nyou know whether or not you're still\n\n571\n00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:49.540\nnear the baseline of the original project\nplan, or have you really deviated from it?\n\n572\n00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.600\n>> Obviously,\nthis is a bit of a complicated topic,\n\n573\n00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.050\njust developing these schedules, but when\nyou get it all working and everything's\n\n574\n00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:01.490\nflowing correctly, it's gonna be a really\nbig help for you as you work the project.\n\n575\n00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:03.750\nYou're gonna be able to,\nat a glance, look and\n\n576\n00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:06.140\nsee where you should be Where\nyour milestones are and\n\n577\n00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:10.420\nall the other helps that we've shown you\nin these two parts of this here episode.\n\n578\n00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.010\nRonnie, thank you so\nmuch for showing this stuff.\n\n579\n00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:17.011\nThis is like crazy math to me, even\nthough it's just one plus one and stuff.\n\n580\n00:33:17.011 --> 00:33:18.971\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's hard for me as well,\n\n581\n00:33:18.971 --> 00:33:19.793\ndon't feel bad.\n\n582\n00:33:19.793 --> 00:33:21.185\n>> No, I made the mistake, right?\n\n583\n00:33:21.185 --> 00:33:22.100\n>> It does happen.\n\n584\n00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:25.570\nBut we do thank you for explaining it\nto us and demonstrating it for us.\n\n585\n00:33:25.570 --> 00:33:28.930\nWe also thank you for watching we hope you\nhad a great time and learned something.\n\n586\n00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:30.790\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n587\n00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.430\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n588\n00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:33.180\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n589\n00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:35.541\n>> We'll

ITproTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:19.505\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.505 --> 00:00:22.545\nwe are continuing on\nwith our Project+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:25.705\nJoining us back in the studio\ntoday to lend his expertise\n\n6\n00:00:25.705 --> 00:00:28.585\non that very topic is our good friend,\nMr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:28.585 --> 00:00:29.955\nRonnie, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:30.565\n>> Well, thank you for\n\n9\n00:00:30.565 --> 00:00:34.970\nhaving me back on the show as we\ncontinue on with our CompTia Project+.\n\n10\n00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.930\nWhat we're actually taking a look\nat today is a little bit more up\n\n11\n00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.710\nthe lines of where Daniel really loves\nto play, which is of course, durations.\n\n12\n00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.350\nIn other words,\n\n13\n00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.090\nactivity estimates on durations of\nwhat those activities are gonna be.\n\n14\n00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.530\nNow I know, Dan,\nthat you have actually been waiting for\n\n15\n00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.240\nthis episode because you love doing math.\n\n16\n00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.522\n>> Yeah, math major.\n\n17\n00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:57.410\nWent through six years of math,\n\n18\n00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.850\nno, one plus one,\nmaybe I'll help you out with that.\n\n19\n00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.400\nBut [LAUGH] math is a hard thing for me,\n\n20\n00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.350\nso Ronnie, I'm guessing I'm gonna\nstruggle with this episode.\n\n21\n00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.450\n>> Well you can, but the good\nthing is we're not gonna get super\n\n22\n00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.550\nin depth into the math, but\nwe at least need to know about some of\n\n23\n00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.340\nthe mathematical techniques that you and\nI are gonna deal with.\n\n24\n00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.020\nNormally when we talk about estimates,\n\n25\n00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.000\nmost of us are used to getting\nsome type of estimate for like,\n\n26\n00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.450\nI want to remodel the house, or I need\nmy car repaired, and I need an estimate.\n\n27\n00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.410\nI need four new tires, give me\nan estimate on how much it's gonna cost.\n\n28\n00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.230\nWell that actually all works out for\nus, cuz it tends to deal with money,\n\n29\n00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.490\nand we pay a great amount of attention\nto actually stuff like that.\n\n30\n00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.200\nAnd that really helps\nus out because it does,\n\n31\n00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.180\nit burns the bottom dollar\nvalue that we have.\n\n32\n00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.010\nBut then, when all of a sudden somebody\nactually starts talking about the idea of\n\n33\n00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.230\nhow long something takes,\n\n34\n00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.820\nwell those are normally more of guesses\nthan they are of anything else.\n\n35\n00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.240\nAnd the problem that you have\nin project management is simple.\n\n36\n00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.091\nYou have a limited amount of time with\na limited amount of resources and\n\n37\n00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:03.879\nyou're supposed to actually\naccomplish something really great and\n\n38\n00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:05.852\nyou have a limited amount of money.\n\n39\n00:02:05.852 --> 00:02:10.189\nSo we talk about the idea of project\nconstraints, right, time cost and\n\n40\n00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.314\nof course requirements when\nyou break it all down.\n\n41\n00:02:13.314 --> 00:02:17.751\nAnd so you, as a project manager,\nmust be familiar with some of\n\n42\n00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:23.195\nthe techniques that are out there,\nsome of the tools that you actually have,\n\n43\n00:02:23.195 --> 00:02:28.388\nthat will help you to be able to\ncalculate the idea of activity durations,\n\n44\n00:02:28.388 --> 00:02:31.460\nas well as coast to our project as well.\n\n45\n00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.399\nAnd we're gonna focus in on\nactivity durations today,\n\n46\n00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:36.407\nis what we're we gonna take a look at.\n\n47\n00:02:36.407 --> 00:02:41.159\nNow, when we start taking a look at that,\nwhen we are now inside of the planning\n\n48\n00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.980\nphase of our project, you and\nI have gotta realize something.\n\n49\n00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.520\nThe very fact is, we don't have any real\nhard dollar values being spent right now.\n\n50\n00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.338\nWe don't really even have anybody doing\nthe actual work that shows that work is\n\n51\n00:02:56.338 --> 00:02:57.294\nprogressing.\n\n52\n00:02:57.294 --> 00:03:02.272\nWhat you and I have essentially, the idea\nthat work has to be done and you and\n\n53\n00:03:02.272 --> 00:03:07.408\nI need to plan out the amount of time it's\ngonna take for a particular task to be\n\n54\n00:03:07.408 --> 00:03:12.727\ndone so we can assign resources to it, so\nthat we can assign values to it as well.\n\n55\n00:03:12.727 --> 00:03:17.848\nAnd that way, by the end of our planning,\nwe have an idea of how long\n\n56\n00:03:17.848 --> 00:03:24.020\nthis project may actually take and\nhow much it may actually cost as well.\n\n57\n00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.350\nSo that's why we need to be familiar\nwith some of these techniques.\n\n58\n00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.910\nSo we need to also be\nfamiliar with them for\n\n59\n00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.340\nthe exam because if not, you're gonna\ncome across questions about hey,\n\n60\n00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.070\nwhich of the following tools are really\ngonna help you out when you have this much\n\n61\n00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.860\ninformation, and\nthat's what we need to take a look at.\n\n62\n00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.230\nAnd there are several that we need to\ntalk about here so let's go ahead and\n\n63\n00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.510\nget started.\n\n64\n00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.850\nSo on my machine, I went ahead and\ncreated a diagram for\n\n65\n00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.510\nus, actually more of just a list.\n\n66\n00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.570\n>> A bulleted list.\n>> Yeah, bulleted list of items here, and\n\n67\n00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.610\nthey're all about activity\nduration estimates.\n\n68\n00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.090\nNow, these are kinda some of the general\nones that I want us to focus in on.\n\n69\n00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.400\nAnd you'll hear these as well.\n\n70\n00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.250\nSo remember that at times because you're\nin the industry and we're in the industry\n\n71\n00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.630\nand also we're preparing for the exam,\nyou're gonna hear different terminology.\n\n72\n00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.520\nIn reality,\nyou may hear different terminology\n\n73\n00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.990\nthan you'll end up seeing on the exam,\nso it's best that you go back and\n\n74\n00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.750\nthat you associate your common,\neveryday terminology\n\n75\n00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.640\nwith the terms we'll be using right\nhere on this episode as we're doing it.\n\n76\n00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.810\nBecause we'll be using, well,\n\n77\n00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.240\nkind of the exam terms that\nyou'll end up seeing instead.\n\n78\n00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.570\nSo match them up for you,\n\n79\n00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.090\njust make sure you associate\nthem the way that you want to.\n\n80\n00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.360\nSo usually some of the terms that you end\nup hearing is something like top-down\n\n81\n00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.510\nestimates.\n\n82\n00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.070\nSo if you hear that term,\n\n83\n00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.590\nthat's pretty much the term that\nyou hear just about everywhere.\n\n84\n00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.780\nBut sometimes you also run into\nthe term analogous estimates as well.\n\n85\n00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.530\nSo in either one of those terms,\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n86\n00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.940\nWell this particular type of estimate\nthat you may have, especially on how\n\n87\n00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.566\nlong something is gonna take, is actually\nwhat we call the idea of analogous.\n\n88\n00:05:10.566 --> 00:05:14.891\nBecause what you do here,\nis that you take a look at your project.\n\n89\n00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:19.159\nAnd then, you go to the project\nmanagement office and you go hey,\n\n90\n00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:22.031\nwhoever's actually there, and you ask for\n\n91\n00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:27.166\nI need projects of kind of the same amount\nas far as the size of the project here.\n\n92\n00:05:27.166 --> 00:05:31.837\nAnd so, I can actually determine what\nsomething like this could actually run me\n\n93\n00:05:31.837 --> 00:05:32.890\nif I were to do it.\n\n94\n00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.933\nSo you're actually looking for\nsomething fairly in the similar scope and\n\n95\n00:05:35.933 --> 00:05:40.220\nactually even activities and\nstuff like that as much as you can.\n\n96\n00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.260\nAnd then you go and you historically find\na project that you think matches yours,\n\n97\n00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.540\nand then you essentially go, well,\n\n98\n00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.220\nthat particular activity is,\nwhatever it is, three weeks long and\n\n99\n00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.630\nthe activity that I have on my\nproject that looks fairly the same.\n\n100\n00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.060\nI'm just gonna say, is kinda\nthe similar or analogous activity, so\n\n101\n00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.880\nI'm gonna use that as my duration\nestimate on my project instead.\n\n102\n00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.470\nSo it's kinda weird,\nyou're actually taking real,\n\n103\n00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:14.360\nactual durations from another project and\nyou're using them as your estimates.\n\n104\n00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.920\nAnd that is actually\na pretty good idea but\n\n105\n00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.780\nit really only works in a couple of ways.\n\n106\n00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.035\nThis by far is the least accurate because\nremember that no two projects are alike,\n\n107\n00:06:25.035 --> 00:06:29.880\nsince projects in the end result\nare supposed to produce a unique product,\n\n108\n00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.570\nservice or result.\n\n109\n00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.980\nSo this is by far the one that is\nthe least accurate of them all.\n\n110\n00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.390\nNow it doesn't mean that they're so\ninaccurate that you can't do it.\n\n111\n00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:45.460\nPeople do the idea of top-down\nestimates all the time,\n\n112\n00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.260\nbut overall though,\nif you're actually looking for\n\n113\n00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.190\nsomething that's almost pinpoint,\nthis is not the one, this is just a basis.\n\n114\n00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.510\n>> So Ronnie, yeah, that really seems\nto be kind of counterintuitive,\n\n115\n00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.120\nto be honest with you.\n\n116\n00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.870\nCuz you think well,\nthese are the same types of projects, so\n\n117\n00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.010\nyou'd think it would be the most accurate,\nbut it ends up not being that way because\n\n118\n00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.700\nof the subtle differences that you\nreally can't account for, right?\n\n119\n00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.780\n>> Right, and if you think about it,\nit makes sense, right,\n\n120\n00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.200\ncuz all we're doing is\nwe're approximating.\n\n121\n00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.910\nIf we could actually line up\nevery activity that you're\n\n122\n00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.550\nactually gonna do line for line,\nthat you might be able to do that.\n\n123\n00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.300\nBut remember,\nwith historical differences as well,\n\n124\n00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.380\nand some of the different time periods and\nwhere that particular project came in,\n\n125\n00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.570\nyou actually see that a lot of times, that\nparticular project was actually run maybe\n\n126\n00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.760\nby a project manager that was insanely\nmore efficient than I would ever be.\n\n127\n00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.500\nSo you might end up seeing\nstuff like that as well.\n\n128\n00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.280\nBut it does,\n\n129\n00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.530\nit actually gives you at least\nan approximation, and that's the key here.\n\n130\n00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.440\nIs that, in estimates we're,\n\n131\n00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.551\nan approximation is like the furthest away\nfrom the truth, an estimation is closer.\n\n132\n00:07:46.551 --> 00:07:51.544\nAn expectation, in other words, of you\nbeing right is the closest thing you\n\n133\n00:07:51.544 --> 00:07:54.597\ncan do without any real\nhard evidence in hand.\n\n134\n00:07:54.597 --> 00:07:58.715\nSo when we actually start talking about an\nanalogous method, it is an approximation.\n\n135\n00:07:58.715 --> 00:08:02.470\nIt's not necessarily anywhere close\nto what we call an estimate or\n\n136\n00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:06.640\neven an expectation, but that's why\nwe actually have to deal with that.\n\n137\n00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.620\n>> It reminds me of Jeff Goldblum's\ncharacter in Jurassic Park when he gives\n\n138\n00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.401\nthe illustration of chaos theory, and\nhe pours the water on the girl's hand-\n\n139\n00:08:14.401 --> 00:08:15.007\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n140\n00:08:15.007 --> 00:08:17.760\n>> And it drips a certain way, and\nhe says we're gonna do it again.\n\n141\n00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.520\nAnd which way is it gonna go?\n\n142\n00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.070\nWell, I'm basing it off of\nmy previous experience.\n\n143\n00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.410\nIt's gonna go the same way.\n\n144\n00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.440\nAnd it goes a different way.\n\n145\n00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.300\nWhy is that?\n\n146\n00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.850\nBecause of minor variations,\nthings that you can't account for\n\n147\n00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:31.930\nthat come into play and changes the scope\nand gives you a different outcome.\n\n148\n00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.770\n>> It really does, and so that's why\nyou only get that approximation.\n\n149\n00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:39.080\nNow the other one is\na little bit more closer to\n\n150\n00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.630\nthe actual estimation that we need.\n\n151\n00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.990\nAnd that's what we call expert judgement.\n\n152\n00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:47.120\nLet's go ahead and take a look at the\nbullet points here for us to go ahead and\n\n153\n00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.760\ndo that as well.\n\n154\n00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.920\nWhen we start taking a look at the idea\nof expert judgement at this point,\n\n155\n00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.250\nthis actually is two-fold in\nthis damage that it can do or\n\n156\n00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.050\nthis great estimation that it can do.\n\n157\n00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.890\nI'm not gonna be able to say that word.\n\n158\n00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.140\nExpert judgments.\n\n159\n00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.810\nA lot of times you can go to a subject\nmatter expert, and he might be right on\n\n160\n00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:10.500\nthe ball with previous projects\nthat he's worked on before and\n\n161\n00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.240\nstill come out wrong, because the person\nthat actually has been assigned that task\n\n162\n00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.260\ndoesn't know what he's doing, okay?\n\n163\n00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.470\nCuz, yeah, if you got your team and\n\n164\n00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.330\nthey know exactly what they're doing,\nworks out perfectly.\n\n165\n00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:28.091\nBut it may be that you do have your team\nbut they've never done anything like\n\n166\n00:09:28.091 --> 00:09:32.798\nthis before and the expert judgement\nat this point can actually be wrong.\n\n167\n00:09:32.798 --> 00:09:38.044\nSo the ideal, ideal with the L at\nthe end here, would be that you actually\n\n168\n00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:43.898\nget an estimate from the person that is\nactually going to be doing the job, okay?\n\n169\n00:09:43.898 --> 00:09:47.945\nSo don't just go to subject matter expert\njust because he says he knows how long it\n\n170\n00:09:47.945 --> 00:09:48.880\nwill take.\n\n171\n00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.850\nDon't get me wrong he can probably\ngive you a pretty good guess, but\n\n172\n00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.840\nyou wanna go to the person if you can.\n\n173\n00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.840\nThat's actually gonna be doing the work\nbecause they know how long something\n\n174\n00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.970\ndoes take to get made, to get done,\nto get whatever it is here.\n\n175\n00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.140\nSo if you can,\n\n176\n00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.180\nthis is actually one of the best things\nthat you can do is actually get the actual\n\n177\n00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:10.200\nestimate from the person that's\nactually doing the actual right line.\n\n178\n00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.080\nNow, the other thing that\nyou have is this, right, and\n\n179\n00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.210\nthis is something that you gotta worry\nabout as far as expert judgments go.\n\n180\n00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.770\nWhen you do get somebody\nthat is experienced at this,\n\n181\n00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.950\nremember that what he's\nworking on is his experience.\n\n182\n00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:25.450\nLet's say he's done this 40 times.\n\n183\n00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:29.910\nLet's say Daniel, though,\nthis is his first time doing it.\n\n184\n00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:35.800\nWhat are the chances that that expert,\nhis particular judgement is yeah,\n\n185\n00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.720\nI could do that in 10 minutes, and\nDaniel says okay, ten minutes it is.\n\n186\n00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.480\nAnd this is his first time doing it.\n\n187\n00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.460\nIt might get him ten minutes\nto just get started.\n\n188\n00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.160\nSo you gotta worry about this.\n\n189\n00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.350\nThat experience normally does\ngive you a very fast estimate.\n\n190\n00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:51.170\nAnd the worst thing,\n\n191\n00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.970\nI know this is gonna sound weird,\nthe worst thing is a very tight estimate.\n\n192\n00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:55.740\nNow, what do I mean by that?\n\n193\n00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:59.430\nIn other words, that guy after\n40 times of doing it, right,\n\n194\n00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:04.400\nhe's kinda perfected how he\ncan reduce the time on things.\n\n195\n00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.090\nWhat is his most efficient methodology?\n\n196\n00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:11.410\nAnd now, you have a very insanely\ntight estimate that works for him.\n\n197\n00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:13.730\nBut it doesn't work for anybody else.\n\n198\n00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:19.920\nSo it can actually be someone that\ncan give you a very good estimate,\n\n199\n00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.510\nif he's actually the one doing the work.\n\n200\n00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:27.790\nBut it can be insanely wrong if you\nactually get the best person in the field\n\n201\n00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.740\nto give you an estimate, and\n\n202\n00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.870\nthen you're bringing on somebody who's,\nI'm supposed to do what?\n\n203\n00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:33.750\nI've never heard of that.\n\n204\n00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.200\nWell, that's a little\nbit more challenging.\n\n205\n00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.750\nSo expert judgment does work, but\n\n206\n00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.360\nyou do have to actually take that into\naccount if you're gonna be doing this.\n\n207\n00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.600\nIf not, you're gonna find\nyourself in a world of hurt.\n\n208\n00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.710\nBecause what I'll end up telling Daniel\nis, it should take that amount of time.\n\n209\n00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:51.610\nAnd Daniel is gonna look at me and\ngo, well, show me Ronnie, show me.\n\n210\n00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:52.680\n>> Yeah, and Ronnie and\n\n211\n00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.850\nI have both actually dealt\nwith people that are that way.\n\n212\n00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:59.170\nThey know the subject as far\nas the theory behind it.\n\n213\n00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:02.710\nThey know it back and forth,\nfront, down, left, sideways.\n\n214\n00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.540\nYou name it,\nthey know it the way the book tells them,\n\n215\n00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.550\nthe way that the theory\nexplains it to them.\n\n216\n00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.070\nBut the person with the actual\nexperience will go, yeah,\n\n217\n00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:16.500\nthat's how it's supposed to work, but\nin practice it tends to do a, b, or c.\n\n218\n00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:21.380\nAnd because of that experience, the expert\nopinions where you have someone that knows\n\n219\n00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.400\nthe theory behind it,\nthey are an expert, right?\n\n220\n00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.390\nThey know that stuff as far as the theory.\n\n221\n00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.470\nBut the person that has done it the 40,\n\n222\n00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.230\n50, 60 times,\nthey are the expert in practical.\n\n223\n00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:33.420\nThat's the better expert.\n\n224\n00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.650\nThey're gonna give you a better,\ntighter, faster,\n\n225\n00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.040\nit sounds like a six million dollar man.\n\n226\n00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.530\nRight?\n[LAUGH] They're gonna give you all\n\n227\n00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:41.880\nthe things you want out of an estimate.\n\n228\n00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.950\nIt's gonna be as close approximation\nbecause not only do they know the subject,\n\n229\n00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.000\nbut they know themselves.\n\n230\n00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.630\nThey know exactly how long it takes them\nto stitch a line six inches long, or\n\n231\n00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.640\nwhatever it is that you need them to do\nbecause they are not only an expert in\n\n232\n00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.640\nthat particular topic, but\nin their ability to do it.\n\n233\n00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.660\nAnd that's where the best\nestimation is gonna come in\n\n234\n00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.290\nwhen it comes to expert judgement.\n\n235\n00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:03.900\n>> It really is.\n\n236\n00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:07.800\nSo if you do know that you're gonna\nbe assigning some task to Daniel, you\n\n237\n00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.250\nsee if he's comfortable with it, and then\nyou go, okay Daniel, give me an estimate.\n\n238\n00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:12.760\nAnd Daniel knows his skill set,\n\n239\n00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.350\nknows his level to be able to actually\ngive you an accurate estimate.\n\n240\n00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:21.030\nIf you, again, take it to the person\nthat's done this for 20 years, and\n\n241\n00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.010\nDaniel's never done it again,\ntaking that guy's estimate and\n\n242\n00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.972\nimplanting it on Daniel is\na little bit more unfair.\n\n243\n00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:31.430\nAnd so, in other words, what will happen\nhere is your estimate will be way skewed,\n\n244\n00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:33.880\nand if you think that's gonna be bad,\nimagine not only doing that for\n\n245\n00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.510\nonly one task you have on your project,\nimagine you saying,\n\n246\n00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:41.310\nI did expert judgments on every\nsingle one, when there's other ways,\n\n247\n00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:44.280\nbetter ways to actually determine\nwhat we have available to us.\n\n248\n00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:44.970\nOkay?\n\n249\n00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.880\nNow the other one that we have\nis actually based a little bit\n\n250\n00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.950\nmore on some mathematics here.\n\n251\n00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:50.530\nAnd that, normally,\n\n252\n00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:54.540\nof course gives you more accuracy\nas far as estimates go, right?\n\n253\n00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:59.240\nSo we talked about the closeness that\nwe can have to the actual truth.\n\n254\n00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.040\nOr the accuracy that we have.\n\n255\n00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.040\nAn approximation again\nis near the truth but\n\n256\n00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:09.400\nit's not anywhere close as far as what we\nhave compared to the other methods, right?\n\n257\n00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.280\nSo, even an estimation is better.\n\n258\n00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.150\nSo, an expert judgement gives\nyou some basis in reality.\n\n259\n00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.870\nSome guy already knows how to do it.\n\n260\n00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.950\nHe's saying,\nthis is how long it actually takes.\n\n261\n00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.740\nAnd then, now you actually have,\nwell, mathematics.\n\n262\n00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.560\nMathematics can give you\na bit more pinpoint,\n\n263\n00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.940\nonly if you have the data though.\n\n264\n00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:31.200\nIf you don't have the data, then you again\nare just guessing and that moves you more\n\n265\n00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.660\ntoward the approximation than it does\ntoward what a real estimate would be.\n\n266\n00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:39.240\nSo when you hear about the term\nparametric estimates as well.\n\n267\n00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:42.220\nParametrics estimates are things\nthat we do every day and\n\n268\n00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.160\nwe don't even realize it sometimes.\n\n269\n00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.420\nWe multiply work times\na productivity rate.\n\n270\n00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.370\nSo let's give you a very real-world\nexample here on ITProTV.\n\n271\n00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:53.840\nThe very fact is\nthe CompTIA Project+ shows,\n\n272\n00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.160\nwe're supposed to produce an hour and\na half of content every day.\n\n273\n00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.180\nMakes sense.\n\n274\n00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.210\nWell then, if I do that five days a week,\nDaniel and I do that five days a week,\n\n275\n00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:08.240\nin theory,you multiply the one point\nfive hours a day times five days.\n\n276\n00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.181\nWell, that's the rate times the actual\nnumber of hours that I end up working.\n\n277\n00:15:12.181 --> 00:15:16.470\nAnd so at the end of the week I should\nhave seven and a half hours of recordable,\n\n278\n00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:20.310\nreproducible content for\nus here on ITProTV.\n\n279\n00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:24.670\nSee, that's an actual real estimate based\noff of things that I'm supposed to do, and\n\n280\n00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:28.440\nI know what the rate is I'm supposed do\nit at, and I know how many days I have.\n\n281\n00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.220\nWe can do that.\n\n282\n00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.520\nAnd we do that for\na lot of different things, and\n\n283\n00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.190\nthis is by far one of the more\nnatural estimates that we have.\n\n284\n00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.070\nAnd it's great as long as you have what?\n\n285\n00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.810\nAccurate data.\n\n286\n00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.720\nIt's terrible when you\nhave inaccurate data.\n\n287\n00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.526\nOr once again, data that is not based on\nyour own experience in this instance here.\n\n288\n00:15:46.526 --> 00:15:50.920\nIt's based on somebody else that has\ndone the job more often than you have or\n\n289\n00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.406\nknows a different method of doing\nit than the way you do it And\n\n290\n00:15:54.406 --> 00:15:56.745\nthat's where you have a real problem.\n\n291\n00:15:56.745 --> 00:15:57.546\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n292\n00:15:57.546 --> 00:16:01.166\nAnd when it comes to using math for\nyour estimations,\n\n293\n00:16:01.166 --> 00:16:05.920\nbeing as accurate with your input\nas possible, is going to be key.\n\n294\n00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.351\nThink of it as the idea of if I'm\noff just by a half a degree, but\n\n295\n00:16:10.351 --> 00:16:14.890\nI've gotta go six miles,\nhow far off of my target am I gonna be?\n\n296\n00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.065\nI'm gonna be huge,\n\n297\n00:16:16.065 --> 00:16:19.580\nbe super off, just because it was\noff a half degree from the start.\n\n298\n00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.540\nThat was a big deal, so\nthe more accurate you keep that,\n\n299\n00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:26.700\nthe less likely you're gonna have\ndeviation from your estimation.\n\n300\n00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.930\nSo try to keep them as\naccurate as possible.\n\n301\n00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:32.910\nInput the best numbers that you\ncan round up for your estimations.\n\n302\n00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:36.200\n>> And then we have one more here,\nwhich is the three point estimates.\n\n303\n00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.020\nNow the three point estimate, you can\nbase this on any data that you want to.\n\n304\n00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.140\nAs long as three points that really do\ncorrelate around what you're trying\n\n305\n00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.460\nto accomplish.\n\n306\n00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.270\nWhen we're trying to calculate duration,\n\n307\n00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:52.040\nright, there's really only three\nvalues that we deal with, okay?\n\n308\n00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.910\nThis is our most pessimistic time.\n\n309\n00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:57.260\nIn other words, the longest time\nwe believe that it's gonna take us\n\n310\n00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:02.520\nto accomplish a task, most pessimistic,\nI'm not gonna say that very easily.\n\n311\n00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.280\nAnd then there's the most optimistic,\nin other words,\n\n312\n00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.310\nthe most efficient time that\nI believe is gonna happen.\n\n313\n00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:10.120\nNow, this is where that\nbelievability comes in.\n\n314\n00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.920\nIn other words,\nit's either from your experience or\n\n315\n00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.210\nyour projections of doing it and\nmost likely.\n\n316\n00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:17.720\nIn other words, let's do this.\n\n317\n00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.170\nWe just average it and\nput it right in the middle.\n\n318\n00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.570\nSo let's take, for an example, that what\nwe said is that whatever task that we have\n\n319\n00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:29.670\non hand, we believe that it's\ngonna take us at a max of 14 days,\n\n320\n00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:35.240\nbut we could actually end up accomplishing\nit in as short as seven days.\n\n321\n00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:40.110\nBut realistically, most likely it's gonna\nbe about ten days, that's our guess.\n\n322\n00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.540\nWell, how do we know that\nwe're just about right.\n\n323\n00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.599\nWell, what we do is take those three\nnumbers and we add them up and\n\n324\n00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:48.594\nwe divide by those three points, right?\n\n325\n00:17:48.594 --> 00:17:52.197\nThe number three and you see that\nhere on my last line right here,\n\n326\n00:17:52.197 --> 00:17:53.930\nis that you divide it up.\n\n327\n00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:56.330\nNow there's a decimal,\nI just kinda rounded it up here.\n\n328\n00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.040\nBut it actually turned out to be,\n\n329\n00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:01.425\nwhen you actually divided it up,\nmost likely about 10 days, okay?\n\n330\n00:18:01.425 --> 00:18:06.050\n10.3, so I rounded down to 10,\nis what you end up seeing.\n\n331\n00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.010\nNow that, you go are you sure?\n\n332\n00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:11.010\nYeah, you can take any three numbers and\ncontinue to do this.\n\n333\n00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:14.450\nAnd you'll probably see that if you\nkinda average it right, then they'll go,\n\n334\n00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:17.240\nyeah I have a ten day project max,\n\n335\n00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.020\nand if I do seven I'm probably\ngonna be just about right.\n\n336\n00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:25.120\nThat's the way that you give yourself\nduration and some time to do it.\n\n337\n00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.840\nIt'll probably work out just about right.\n\n338\n00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:32.520\nThe problem that you have is, well,\nmost likely this is not weighted.\n\n339\n00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.800\nIn other words, it's actually\njust one of three values here,\n\n340\n00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.380\nand that means all three of them\nare equally possible, right?\n\n341\n00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.050\nCuz we're just dividing by three, right?\n\n342\n00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:46.670\nWe're saying that the most pessimistic\ntime that I have is just as likely\n\n343\n00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:51.141\nto happen as the most optimistic time\nthis is likely as to happen as the most\n\n344\n00:18:51.141 --> 00:18:56.670\nlikely time, yeah, I just wanna\nmake sure I'm saying that right.\n\n345\n00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.580\nYeah, so when I do something\nlike a three point estimate,\n\n346\n00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.520\nall of them are actually\nweighted the same here.\n\n347\n00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.060\nNow the problem that we have is\nwhen you hear the term most likely,\n\n348\n00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.000\nwe're really saying, what, that that\nshould actually have more weight and\n\n349\n00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.400\nvalue to it than the most optimistic.\n\n350\n00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:14.963\nWhich is,\n\n351\n00:19:14.963 --> 00:19:17.669\nlet's face it, that's actually on the-\n>> Pie in the sky.\n\n352\n00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:21.596\n>> Yeah that's really like the,\nlike I could possible get in,\n\n353\n00:19:21.596 --> 00:19:27.012\nif everything worked perfectly and there's\nnothing that actually gets outside.\n\n354\n00:19:27.012 --> 00:19:30.530\nI can reach in and\nI pick up the perfect rent or\n\n355\n00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:34.300\nwhatever it is,\nthat I don't waste any time at all.\n\n356\n00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:39.140\nThen the most pessimistic time is\nlook I gotta read the diagram,\n\n357\n00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:42.270\nI gotta figure out what I'm actually\ndoing, I gotta do all that.\n\n358\n00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:43.470\nYes.\n\n359\n00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:46.406\nBut what were normally\nreally saying though,\n\n360\n00:19:46.406 --> 00:19:49.347\nin all reality is what\nwe call the most likely.\n\n361\n00:19:49.347 --> 00:19:52.641\nAnd if we think about that is\nactually what should be weighted\n\n362\n00:19:52.641 --> 00:19:57.260\na little bit more because that's the one\nwe're actually expecting to happen.\n\n363\n00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.000\nThat is what we're\nexpecting to happen is that\n\n364\n00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.780\nwe're not the slowest people in the world.\n\n365\n00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.062\nWe're not the fastest people in the world.\n\n366\n00:20:03.062 --> 00:20:07.220\nWe probably fall right in\nthe middle as far as durations go.\n\n367\n00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:11.065\nNow remember that all of these techniques\nthat we're talking about right here,\n\n368\n00:20:11.065 --> 00:20:14.075\nlet me zoom out so we can see all of them,\nagain, just briefly.\n\n369\n00:20:14.075 --> 00:20:18.458\nI know it's not the greatest\nzoom out here, but\n\n370\n00:20:18.458 --> 00:20:23.460\nall four of these can give\nus at least some help.\n\n371\n00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.200\nBut the problem is that there's still,\n\n372\n00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.910\nagain, estimates as far as\nwe can actually throw them.\n\n373\n00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:32.740\nAnd so estimates will work when\nwe don't have a ton of data.\n\n374\n00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.490\nBut we still need to get\nstarted somehow in our planning\n\n375\n00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.180\nof how long things take place.\n\n376\n00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.638\nSo what can we do that's actually\na little bit better is to pick\n\n377\n00:20:42.638 --> 00:20:46.513\nthe tool that really can help\nus out a little bit more.\n\n378\n00:20:46.513 --> 00:20:50.498\nAnd this is what is known\nin the industry as PERT, or\n\n379\n00:20:50.498 --> 00:20:54.590\nProgram Evaluation and Review Technique.\n\n380\n00:20:54.590 --> 00:21:00.050\nNow when we take a look at this\nProgram Evaluation and Review Technique,\n\n381\n00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:05.290\nthis is actually what gives you what\nwe call an expected value, okay?\n\n382\n00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:08.878\nSo when it comes down to accuracy,\nwe have the true accuracy,\n\n383\n00:21:08.878 --> 00:21:11.431\nand let's say that that's the center, and\n\n384\n00:21:11.431 --> 00:21:15.730\nthen a ring outside of that would\nbe expected values, more realistic.\n\n385\n00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:17.660\nIn other words, this is what we're\nactually expecting to happen.\n\n386\n00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.955\nAnd then an estimate is what\nwe're guessing will happen, and\n\n387\n00:21:21.955 --> 00:21:23.699\nthen an approximation.\n\n388\n00:21:23.699 --> 00:21:28.460\nWell we can come close to what we\nthink might actually happen here.\n\n389\n00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:33.420\nSo the further away from accuracy that\nyou're moving here expected value is right\n\n390\n00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.590\nthere, is right near the center\nwhen you do stuff like this.\n\n391\n00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:43.880\nNow, this particular Idea\nreally comes from a neat place.\n\n392\n00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.060\nAnd I like the history\nbehind this one here.\n\n393\n00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:52.170\nIt comes from the Polaris missile project\nthat we had happening during the 1950s.\n\n394\n00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:55.740\nAnd this is where the Navy actually\ncame up with it as they were\n\n395\n00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.600\ntrying to map essentially underwater\ncanyons in the polar ice caps so\n\n396\n00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:03.180\nthat they could launch ICBM\nmissiles over the North Pole.\n\n397\n00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.650\nThat's what it comes down to, so they\nwere trying to figure out how to do this.\n\n398\n00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.460\nWell Daniel and I were talking\nabout this right before the show,\n\n399\n00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:14.030\nhow the heck do you guess how big\na canyon is and map all this stuff out?\n\n400\n00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:19.120\nFigure out how deep these canyons\nare how long these canyons are.\n\n401\n00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.740\nWhen you're inside of a boat that's\nunder water that has no windows and\n\n402\n00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.090\nyou don't really have anything\nthat you can measure by.\n\n403\n00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:27.610\nWell somebody figured it out, and\n\n404\n00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:31.520\nthey used what we called this\nidea of PERT to help them to say\n\n405\n00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.370\nthis is how long this gonna take us to\nmap this stuff out from right here.\n\n406\n00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:40.160\nAnd they were actually after using\nit they were surprised at how close\n\n407\n00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.500\nthe actual expected value\nactually came out to be.\n\n408\n00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.880\nSo you can imagine why\nthis was something else.\n\n409\n00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.850\nNow is actually kind of grand for\n\n410\n00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:54.360\nthem to figure out is that this\ntechnique actually ends up working here.\n\n411\n00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:59.480\nNow the way that this works is right here,\nokay I have the actual.\n\n412\n00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:04.180\nLet me zoom in and we'll come back to\nthe formula above it in just a moment.\n\n413\n00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:09.870\nIn PERT the basic formula is you\ntake the most optimistic time and\n\n414\n00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:16.050\nthe most pessimistic time and you add that\ntogether with four times the most likely.\n\n415\n00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:17.720\nThis is where you get a weighted value,\n\n416\n00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.950\nwhere you're saying,\nhere's the most likely estimate.\n\n417\n00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:25.020\nOkay, here's the most likely time that we\nbelieve, and then you divide it all by 6.\n\n418\n00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:25.690\nNow, why by 6?\n\n419\n00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:30.390\nCuz you have one for optimistic,\none for pessimistic, four times for\n\n420\n00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:31.590\nthe most likely.\n\n421\n00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:32.170\nWell, that's 6.\n\n422\n00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:33.420\nAnd then you divide it by 6 here, and\n\n423\n00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.450\nthat gives you that estimate\nthat you take a look at.\n\n424\n00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:38.510\nAnd that you end up and you get here.\n\n425\n00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:42.470\nSo you're actually weighting it a little\nbit differently here when you start doing,\n\n426\n00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:43.800\nand there it is, that's that four times.\n\n427\n00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.636\nAnd that's why you get\nthose values that you get.\n\n428\n00:23:46.636 --> 00:23:48.827\nSo if I were to show you an example,\n\n429\n00:23:48.827 --> 00:23:52.317\nthis is what it would\nessentially end up looking like.\n\n430\n00:23:52.317 --> 00:23:56.332\nSo let's say, and I chose very simple\nnumbers, most pessimistic time,\n\n431\n00:23:56.332 --> 00:23:58.036\nlet's say it takes 20 days.\n\n432\n00:23:58.036 --> 00:24:02.648\nMost optimistic, is it takes 10days,\nmost likely, 15.\n\n433\n00:24:02.648 --> 00:24:04.610\nNow how did I come up with those numbers?\n\n434\n00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:09.647\nI said if my most pessimistic is 20,\nif I cut that in half, I'm gonna say\n\n435\n00:24:09.647 --> 00:24:15.390\nthat would be a dream, is to cut\nwhatever my basic estimate was in half.\n\n436\n00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.470\nBut more than likely I'm gonna\ncome in in between that.\n\n437\n00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:19.470\nSo 15 actually seemed perfect.\n\n438\n00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:22.670\nNow if we break that down\ninto that formula and\n\n439\n00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:24.840\nwe take a look over here to the right.\n\n440\n00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:25.990\nSo we do the same thing and\n\n441\n00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:30.330\nwe followed that technique that we\nunderstand from map, PMDoS here, right.\n\n442\n00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:34.480\nWe multiple those inside of\nthe actual parentheses first.\n\n443\n00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.160\nSo 4 times 15, that gives you 60.\n\n444\n00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.510\nAnd then you add in the other two numbers,\nand when you do the 10, the 20,\n\n445\n00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:43.830\nand the 60, that gives you 90.\n\n446\n00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:49.400\nAnd then you take 90 and you divide\nit by 6, that gives you 15 days.\n\n447\n00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.270\nWell look at that,\nmy most likely time was 15 days.\n\n448\n00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.820\nThat's what I chose at the beginning, so\n\n449\n00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:59.720\nthe math actually ended up showing\nthat this is likely to happen.\n\n450\n00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:04.790\nSo likely,\nhow do I know how often this is to happen?\n\n451\n00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:08.880\nBelieve it or not, this actually does\nwork out to about 68% of the time.\n\n452\n00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:13.320\nNow you're saying, Ronnie, where\nthe heck did you get that value from?\n\n453\n00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:19.110\nWell, in the way that probability and\nstatistics end up working, and in project\n\n454\n00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:23.720\nmanagement they do base a lot on the idea\nof probability and statistics here.\n\n455\n00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:27.110\nNotice there's a formula for\nstandard deviation.\n\n456\n00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:31.020\nStandard deviation takes what,\nthe most pessimistic time,\n\n457\n00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:35.740\nsubtracts the most optimistic time and\ndivides it by 6.\n\n458\n00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:39.350\nSo this formula wasn't just\npulled out of the air, okay?\n\n459\n00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:42.690\nThis formula is based on\nstandard deviation formula,\n\n460\n00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:47.480\nwhere they simply added in another value\nand they gave it a little bit of weight.\n\n461\n00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.130\nNow what does that mean?\n\n462\n00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.740\nWell, one representation of standard\ndeviation represents about 68% of\n\n463\n00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.940\nthe time that this is gonna likely happen.\n\n464\n00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.740\nIf I increase the standard\ndeviation to 2 standard deviations,\n\n465\n00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:05.670\nI'm actually saying 95% of\nthe time it's likely to happen.\n\n466\n00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:09.240\nSo when take a look at this,\nyou can actually take this.\n\n467\n00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.200\nAnd you can take that 15 days and then\nyou can do the other formula there for\n\n468\n00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:17.160\nstandard deviation and\nyou can add in and figure this out.\n\n469\n00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.173\nWhere if you actually figure that out,\n\n470\n00:26:20.173 --> 00:26:25.014\nyou'll see that you'll get\na range that is anywhere between,\n\n471\n00:26:25.014 --> 00:26:30.330\nlet's say 12.13 days,\nall the way up to 18.73, I think.\n\n472\n00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:31.468\nSomewhere around there.\n\n473\n00:26:31.468 --> 00:26:34.660\nSo in other words, you actually see that\nthere's a range of possibilities there if\n\n474\n00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.490\nyou were to do something like that.\n\n475\n00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:37.430\nNow you're probably saying,\n\n476\n00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:39.810\nwell Ronnie, do I really need\nto know that for the exam?\n\n477\n00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.930\nYou need to understand\nthe standard deviation,\n\n478\n00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:43.970\nthat's why I put the formula up there.\n\n479\n00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:47.930\nYou need to at least understand that when\nsomebody's using this PERT technique,\n\n480\n00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:51.668\non the first time, they're measuring\nthat first standard deviation.\n\n481\n00:26:51.668 --> 00:26:53.210\nThey're saying 70% of the time,\n\n482\n00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:57.600\njust about, more than likely\nthis is likely to be the truth.\n\n483\n00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.516\nNow, the nice thing about this is,\nand really is,\n\n484\n00:27:01.516 --> 00:27:06.631\nis the very fact that today a lot\nof people don't use this anymore.\n\n485\n00:27:06.631 --> 00:27:10.921\n1950s, and the reason why is that we've\ncome out with computer-aided models and\n\n486\n00:27:10.921 --> 00:27:12.930\nsome different things that's gone on.\n\n487\n00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:14.690\nSoftware's actually gotten better.\n\n488\n00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:15.860\nAnd so, can this still be done?\n\n489\n00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:16.660\nYes.\n\n490\n00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:17.340\nWhere is it done?\n\n491\n00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.040\nIn insanely large projects.\n\n492\n00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.520\nWhen I say that, I'm talking about\nprojects that take 10 or 20 years.\n\n493\n00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.620\nI'm not saying you can't do it,\neven if you wanted to today.\n\n494\n00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.380\nBut, a lot of times today,\nwe rely on the software,\n\n495\n00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.510\nwe rely on calculated models that\nare out there instead of this.\n\n496\n00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:33.430\nBecause it is still in the end here,\n\n497\n00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:38.270\nright, an estimated technique that\ngives you what's the expected value.\n\n498\n00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:41.140\nAnd it's fairly close, but\nif you need true accuracy,\n\n499\n00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:44.540\nyou're going to go beyond this to\nsome type of other model instead.\n\n500\n00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.280\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n501\n00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.570\nThat PERT is very, very neat.\n\n502\n00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:50.250\nAnd the fact that it has the whole\nPolaris project behind it is kind of\n\n503\n00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:52.940\nSome cool history to help you\nremember how it works out and\n\n504\n00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.340\nwhy you might wanna use it\nin what kind of projects.\n\n505\n00:27:55.340 --> 00:28:00.880\nNow, Ronnie, another model that you may\nwanna use is the Gantt chart, right?\n\n506\n00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.450\nThat's something that's very\ncommon in project management.\n\n507\n00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.600\n>> There's no doubt that the Gantt chart\nis probably one of the best things that\n\n508\n00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.570\nyou can end up using as far as one of\nthe other things that can give you some\n\n509\n00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:12.400\nduration estimates here.\n\n510\n00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.010\nAnd this is actually one\nthat you'll probably see in\n\n511\n00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:18.620\nmost project management information\nsystem software instead.\n\n512\n00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:21.410\nCan you still do this\nby hand if you want to?\n\n513\n00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:23.260\nYes, okay.\n\n514\n00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:27.200\nBut I don't know why you would if\nyou have the chance to use software.\n\n515\n00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.910\nBecause by doing it by hand right, once\nit's actually done, you make a mistake and\n\n516\n00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:36.170\na lot of eraser marks are ultimately\ngonna drive you nuts at the end.\n\n517\n00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:37.690\nSo let me show you an example again,\n\n518\n00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:43.330\nwe've already taken a look at the same\none in a previous episode here.\n\n519\n00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:46.180\nLet me see if I can zoom out\njust a little here, there we go.\n\n520\n00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:50.530\nThe Gantt chart is actually one that gives\nus details over here on the left side.\n\n521\n00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:54.900\nAs far as the actual model goes,\ntells task duration, start and\n\n522\n00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:59.610\nfinishes, and then over on the right-hand\nside a graphic model as well.\n\n523\n00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:01.480\nNow the reason why this\nis important is because,\n\n524\n00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.670\nit actually includes in all the elements,\nright.\n\n525\n00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:05.140\nWe get a calendar.\n\n526\n00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:08.160\nWe can even go ahead and\nassign resources to it.\n\n527\n00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.740\nWe can even assign cost values to it.\n\n528\n00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.760\nAnd using the software,\n\n529\n00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.620\nit actually determines all\nthat stuff in the background.\n\n530\n00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:18.190\nAnd then allows us to see\nthe whole thing graphically too.\n\n531\n00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:21.590\nSo today, if there's a method that\nyou're more than likely gonna choose,\n\n532\n00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:24.120\nit's probably gonna be one of\nthese information systems.\n\n533\n00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:29.455\nNow, this is actually done, if you need\nto see it essentially graphically, all\n\n534\n00:29:29.455 --> 00:29:35.035\nthe other ones, if it's not a guess, it's\nan estimate or based on some type of map.\n\n535\n00:29:35.035 --> 00:29:39.508\nSo depending on the result that you need,\nyou can choose any of these techniques\n\n536\n00:29:39.508 --> 00:29:43.980\nthat you need to give you what you're\nactually taking a look at as well.\n\n537\n00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:47.570\nSo, just kinda realize that yeah,\npicking the appropriate tool is\n\n538\n00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:50.770\nsomething that's actually a part\nof what a project manager does.\n\n539\n00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:55.210\nAnd a lot of times today because you do\nhave a big team behind you a lot of times,\n\n540\n00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:56.010\nyou don't really have to do it.\n\n541\n00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:57.670\nYou can just say, here's what I need.\n\n542\n00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:58.693\nAnd that person goes,\n\n543\n00:29:58.693 --> 00:30:01.400\nI know what tool that I'm gonna\nuse here to figure this out.\n\n544\n00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:05.170\nBut more than likely, if you have some\ntype of information system like this,\n\n545\n00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:08.076\nyou plug in your numbers and\nthat's what happens, right?\n\n546\n00:30:08.076 --> 00:30:10.232\nSomebody actually just goes ahead and\nplugs in the numbers for\n\n547\n00:30:10.232 --> 00:30:12.950\nthe duration here on the left-hand\nside of the third column.\n\n548\n00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:14.130\nAnd then they just tell you.\n\n549\n00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:16.990\nAnd your the project manager, you go,\nI really need that take four days?\n\n550\n00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:18.990\nWell, he just changed\nthat number to four days.\n\n551\n00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:22.840\nAnd then you can actually see what\nthat does to the rest of your project.\n\n552\n00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.300\nThat's why this one is probably the most\ncomprehensive tool that we have and\n\n553\n00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.400\nis not just an approximation,\nnot just an estimate.\n\n554\n00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.450\nThis is actually one that really you\ncan see and you can manipulate and\n\n555\n00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:33.680\nsee the rest of it.\n\n556\n00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.750\nAnd that's why this tool is so\nvaluable and so amazing.\n\n557\n00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:41.350\n>> Yeah, you can see why it is definitely\nthe preferred method of choice for\n\n558\n00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.490\nprobably most of your projects and\n\n559\n00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:46.880\nyour project managers out there too\nto try to keep track of things and\n\n560\n00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:52.120\nsee what's going to take how long or other\ndurations as we're looking at them today.\n\n561\n00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.120\nRonnie, any other methods\nthat we need to go over?\n\n562\n00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.700\n>> Well, there's at least several\nother methods that we need to go over.\n\n563\n00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:59.910\nBut Daniel,\nit looks like you let me talk too long,\n\n564\n00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:03.390\nand that means we've got to take\nthis over into another episode.\n\n565\n00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:06.380\n>> Well, hey, if we have to,\nthat's what we gotta do.\n\n566\n00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.720\nThe clock has ticked its last tock, so\n\n567\n00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:13.193\nlook forward to seeing you in the part\ntwo of our little mini series here.\n\n568\n00:31:13.193 --> 00:31:14.360\nHopefully we'll see you there as well.\n\n569\n00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.290\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n570\n00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.060\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n571\n00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:18.740\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n572\n00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.775\n>> And

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:19.646\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.646 --> 00:00:21.882\nwe are continuing on\nwith our Project+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:23.371\nWe're going to our Part two.\n\n6\n00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:27.260\nI am picking a project tool for\nestimating your duration activity.\n\n7\n00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.660\nJoining us back to help ground that out\nthat little topic is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.050\nRonnie, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.750\n>> Thank you for having me.\n\n10\n00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.730\nAs we need to continue to take\na look at picking a project tool,\n\n11\n00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.330\nremember that we're in the middle of\nour CompTIA Project+ series here,\n\n12\n00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.997\nand what we're doing is we're planning\nfor, of course, activity duration.\n\n13\n00:00:43.997 --> 00:00:46.130\nWe're trying to come up with estimates so\n\n14\n00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.020\nthat we can take whatever we have,\nas far as an activity goes, and\n\n15\n00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.590\nsay how long we believe it's gonna\ntake for us to accomplish that.\n\n16\n00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.960\nNow, in a previous episode, we've already\ntaken a look at seven different methods.\n\n17\n00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.950\nWe've talked about\nthree-point estimations.\n\n18\n00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.930\nWe've also talked about parametric\nestimations, expert judgments,\n\n19\n00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.840\nas well as the idea here of just top-down.\n\n20\n00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.840\nWe even took a look briefly at using\nthe PERT analysis to help us out\n\n21\n00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.110\nto be able to give us\nan expected value instead, and\n\n22\n00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.080\nall of that actually works\nthe way that we want them to.\n\n23\n00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.340\nBut there's sometimes what\nyou also end up with,\n\n24\n00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.370\nthough, is that you need to\nactually have a better estimate for\n\n25\n00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.010\nthe entire project plan, and\nthat's what you really also need as well.\n\n26\n00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.000\nAnd one of the methods that\nwe can actually use here\n\n27\n00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.736\nis the critical path method.\n\n28\n00:01:35.736 --> 00:01:39.970\nNow, we've already taken a look\nat one example of it, but\n\n29\n00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.190\nwe wanna take you through another\nexample to make sure that this does\n\n30\n00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.560\nget down into your mind where it needs\nto be, and you understand how to do\n\n31\n00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.790\nthe actual critical path method given\nthe data that you have in front of you.\n\n32\n00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.560\nIt's important, especially if\nyou're preparing as a candidate for\n\n33\n00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.810\nthe Project+ Exam that you know and\n\n34\n00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.570\nunderstand a forward pass as\nwell as a backward pass and\n\n35\n00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.440\nhow to determine the float that's actually\nin your project, and not only off of one\n\n36\n00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.660\nvery simple diagram critical path\nmethod like what we showed you before,\n\n37\n00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.640\nbut now, actually, taking in a couple\nof different instances in place, too.\n\n38\n00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.920\nI'm gonna show you another\none that we need, and\n\n39\n00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.080\nthat's what we're actually\ngonna start off with right now.\n\n40\n00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.780\nSo when we start talking about using\nthe critical path, let's go ahead and\n\n41\n00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.170\ntake a look at my diagram here.\n\n42\n00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.660\nAs we start off, remember that what we're\ntaking away at the entire rectangle that\n\n43\n00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.600\nyou see over here on the left-hand side\nrepresents a task or an activity, okay?\n\n44\n00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.890\nSo depending on who you talk to, remember\nthat those terms, they're interchangeable.\n\n45\n00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.200\nSo if you hear the term task,\nyou hear the term work package,\n\n46\n00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.340\nyou hear the term activity, they're\nall gonna mean about the same thing.\n\n47\n00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.590\nAnd because we're talking about trying\nto figure out the duration of tasks\n\n48\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.810\nas well as the entire project,\n\n49\n00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.390\nwhat you normally have are some different\nelements involved in every task.\n\n50\n00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.700\nYou have ES over here,\nwhich stands for Early Start.\n\n51\n00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.850\nWhat is the earliest this task can\nstart according to our project plan?\n\n52\n00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.490\nAnd then that means you also can\ndetermine the early finish as well.\n\n53\n00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.400\nNow, once you actually determine the early\nstarts and the early finishes for\n\n54\n00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.190\neverything in your project plan,\nthat normally will give you the duration\n\n55\n00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.050\nof the entire project that you have and\na couple of other things, too.\n\n56\n00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.140\nBut at least that's what\nit normally gives you.\n\n57\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.140\nNow, the other thing\nthat you may determine,\n\n58\n00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.650\nthough, is there's a range\nof numbers here, right?\n\n59\n00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.990\nAnd what we wanna determine at this\npoint as well is what we call the latest\n\n60\n00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.580\npossible start and the latest possible\nfinish that we can have to that task as\n\n61\n00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.160\nwell to still keep us on track for\nfinishing our project, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.890\nAnd we'll do that.\n\n63\n00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.400\nWe'll actually do that in what\nwe call a backward pass, too.\n\n64\n00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.380\nNow, a lot of times when you see it, it's\nactually using this or something fairly\n\n65\n00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.170\nsimilar to this, but it doesn't mean\nthat you'll see these boxes drawn out.\n\n66\n00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.620\nMost of the time, project manager\nwill simply write in the area, and\n\n67\n00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.260\nthat's pretty much the key.\n\n68\n00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.360\nBut if it's in the upper left-hand corner,\nit's gonna be the early start.\n\n69\n00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.302\nUpper right-hand corner, the early finish.\n\n70\n00:04:13.302 --> 00:04:18.850\nLower left-hand corner, the late start,\nand then the late finish.\n\n71\n00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.910\nIn between the late start and\nthe late finish, you'll also\n\n72\n00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.990\nsee that there are probably gonna be\na number that's gonna be floating.\n\n73\n00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.340\nSometimes you'll see it written down here.\n\n74\n00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.360\nSometimes you'll actually see it kinda\nwritten a little bit higher as well\n\n75\n00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.490\nis the duration of that task.\n\n76\n00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.540\nWhat is the expected duration, or\nwhat is your estimate for that duration?\n\n77\n00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.930\nAnd of course, the name.\n\n78\n00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.140\nNow, the name can be written\nright here in the middle, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.400\nSometimes you actually see it written on\ntop of each of these boxes as well, and\n\n80\n00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.780\nthen normally at the bottom,\nyou actually write what we call float.\n\n81\n00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.090\nFloat, for us, is actually also another\nelement that we're trying to determine,\n\n82\n00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.620\nand that is essentially what we\ncall the free time that we have for\n\n83\n00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.790\nthat task to adjust either\nearly start to late start.\n\n84\n00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.680\nYou have that ability to actually adjust\nthat task to begin a little bit earlier,\n\n85\n00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.270\nor to begin a little bit later,\nor to finish earlier, or\n\n86\n00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.000\nto finish later as well.\n\n87\n00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.110\nSo understanding those elements, right?\n\n88\n00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.340\nWe've already done one of these, but it's\nsomething that we will end up determining\n\n89\n00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.050\nagain, because it's an essential part of\nwhat a project manager will need to do for\n\n90\n00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.350\ntheir project, and\nthey'll have to do this again if task and\n\n91\n00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.162\nif time changes for their project, too.\n\n92\n00:05:30.162 --> 00:05:33.930\nSo here's that basic\nbreakdown when you see this.\n\n93\n00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.740\nSo let's go ahead and\nshow you the critical path method here.\n\n94\n00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.710\nIt is what we want to begin with.\n\n95\n00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.860\nAnd you'll see that this particular\nproject begins at activity A,\n\n96\n00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.750\nand there's three possible\npaths through this project.\n\n97\n00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.970\nI was about to say two.\n\n98\n00:05:52.970 --> 00:06:00.593\nBut notice that I have the ability to\ngo from A to E to F to G to H to I,\n\n99\n00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:06.238\nor I have the ability to go\nfrom A to B to C to D to I,\n\n100\n00:06:06.238 --> 00:06:11.037\nor I have the ability\nto go from A to B to C,\n\n101\n00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:15.310\npossibly up to G, H, and then to I.\n\n102\n00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.240\nNow, you may be wondering, why in the\nworld would something like this happen?\n\n103\n00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.980\nWell, sometimes it does happen like that\nwhere you end up realizing that hey,\n\n104\n00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.710\nthere's another possible way that we can\nactually determine what we call that\n\n105\n00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.370\ncritical path, and that is the longest\nuninterrupted path through\n\n106\n00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.440\nmy entire project,\none that doesn't have any float in it.\n\n107\n00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.320\nAnd if there's no adjustment for\nthe float of whether I can actually\n\n108\n00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.180\nadjust the start time or\nthe finish time to the particular task,\n\n109\n00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.330\nthat means that that particular task,\nif somebody actually moves it along that\n\n110\n00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.990\npath, it will overall affect\nthe end date of my project.\n\n111\n00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.710\nAnd most of the time, it affects the end\ndate towards the adverse condition,\n\n112\n00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.370\nnot generally for my favor, so that's\nwhy we're normally looking for that.\n\n113\n00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.710\nSo anytime along that we find there's a\ncritical path here, what we're looking for\n\n114\n00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.790\nis that path that we know that if we\nadjust anything along this path, and\n\n115\n00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.750\nit affects the overall finish date, well,\n\n116\n00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.890\nanything in there is\nactually gonna do that.\n\n117\n00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.940\nSo that's what we need to determine.\n\n118\n00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.630\nSo let's make sure that we\nunderstand how we begin, okay?\n\n119\n00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.060\nSo over here on task A, again.\n\n120\n00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.270\nNotice that this duration\nhappens with a one day duration.\n\n121\n00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.330\nAnd we'll just take it as one day.\n\n122\n00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:35.030\nAnd so when I start that task,\nmy earliest start is on day one, okay?\n\n123\n00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:36.610\nSo we don't count day zero here.\n\n124\n00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.448\nWe'll start with day one.\n\n125\n00:07:38.448 --> 00:07:43.849\nAnd if I have where that task starts\non day one and finishes on day one,\n\n126\n00:07:43.849 --> 00:07:49.548\nwell, that means my earliest finish\nwill be at the end of day one, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:49.548 --> 00:07:51.850\nSo now,\nI'm beginning what we call the four pass.\n\n128\n00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.773\nWe're gonna take the top path and\nthen we'll do the bottom as well.\n\n129\n00:07:55.773 --> 00:07:59.486\nNow, we can only do it partially and\nthen we'll have to kind of switch off and\n\n130\n00:07:59.486 --> 00:08:01.239\ndo something else here in a moment.\n\n131\n00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:03.619\nSo we'll take the top path.\n\n132\n00:08:03.619 --> 00:08:08.581\nIf the earliest finish that I\ncan have is day one, on task A,\n\n133\n00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:13.545\nthat means on task E,\nthe earliest start that I have is gonna\n\n134\n00:08:13.545 --> 00:08:18.530\nbe not at the end of day one,\nbut at the beginning of day two.\n\n135\n00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:27.680\nSo if day two is where I begin task E and\nI have a one day duration on that task.\n\n136\n00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.660\nThat will mean that I will also finish\non day two of that task as well.\n\n137\n00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.990\nThen for task F that\n\n138\n00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.100\nmeans that the earliest start that I will\nhave is at the beginning of day three,\n\n139\n00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.940\nright, because I ended on day two and\nthis now means day three.\n\n140\n00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.213\nHere is another task that\nlasts the entire day.\n\n141\n00:08:49.213 --> 00:08:51.740\nSo the earliest day that I\nwill finish here is three.\n\n142\n00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:57.720\nNow I cannot determine this next one yet,\nbecause there are actually two\n\n143\n00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.660\npredecessors to task G\nthat I need to determine.\n\n144\n00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:07.520\nSo then I come back here to Task A, and\nwe do the same thing on this bottom path.\n\n145\n00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.710\nSo now at this particular point,\nthis means that the earliest\n\n146\n00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:17.300\nfinish here is day one and so\non task number two, my earliest start\n\n147\n00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:22.780\nis day two and this is now a two\nday task according to what we see.\n\n148\n00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:28.440\nSo we count all of day two, and we count\nday three as being a two-day task.\n\n149\n00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.890\nSo the earliest finish here is day three,\nright?\n\n150\n00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.570\nDay two and day three.\n\n151\n00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:39.070\nSo that means for task C,\nthe earliest start that I will have here\n\n152\n00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:44.080\nis going to be the beginning of\nday four and here is today, so\n\n153\n00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:50.130\nI count day four and day five, so\nthat my earliest finish here is day five.\n\n154\n00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:54.830\nSo now, this is where we actually\nhave a little bit of a conundrum.\n\n155\n00:09:54.830 --> 00:10:00.730\nNotice that both of these will\naffect when task G begins, okay.\n\n156\n00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:06.410\nIf I actually assume that this is day\nfour, for task G as early as start,\n\n157\n00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:11.690\nwell I discount that task C is\nactually gonna be a predecessor.\n\n158\n00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:18.410\nSo I cannot actually use day four\nas being the earliest start.\n\n159\n00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.770\nMine here has to come from right here.\n\n160\n00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:25.550\nThe earliest start that G can have and\nit takes into account both paths\n\n161\n00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:29.760\nis gonna be day five which means\nthat the earliest start for\n\n162\n00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:35.910\nG is gonna be six because day\nfive actually accounts for that.\n\n163\n00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:40.040\nWe start at day 4, we're saying we\ndon't care what happens here at C,\n\n164\n00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.230\nwe're just going ahead with our own path.\n\n165\n00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:45.600\nSo now, day six, seven and eight,\n\n166\n00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.580\nso that means the earliest\nfinish up here is eight, and\n\n167\n00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:55.010\nnow for H the earliest start\nthere is gonna be nine.\n\n168\n00:10:55.010 --> 00:11:00.228\nLet me move this out of the way and\nnow three days, 9, 10 and 11 and\n\n169\n00:11:00.228 --> 00:11:07.470\nthis is 11 and that means here and\na couple of about that now and\n\n170\n00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.470\nlet me go and determine this and\nverify that we're on the right path.\n\n171\n00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.930\nSo now I have to come back here to D,\nand now from this one because it\n\n172\n00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:19.068\nis the direct path here,\nday five does now turns into day six.\n\n173\n00:11:19.068 --> 00:11:26.679\nFor the earliest here in five days,\nsix, seven, eight, nine, and ten.\n\n174\n00:11:26.679 --> 00:11:30.320\nHere, and ten.\n\n175\n00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:35.300\nSo now look at I, remember that\nthere's two predecessors now,\n\n176\n00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.560\nif I go ahead and start on day 11 okay?\n\n177\n00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.280\nTask H is not yet finished.\n\n178\n00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:47.450\nSo, if task H isn't finished what\nI'm gonna say if I start task I on\n\n179\n00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:53.860\nday 11 is I am discounting that H as isn't\nanywhere valuable to my project plan.\n\n180\n00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.270\nSo, instead I need to actually\ntake this into account and\n\n181\n00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.970\nthat means that task I will go ahead and\nstart on day 12 and\n\n182\n00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:05.150\nmy earliest finish here will be day 12,\nis what we'll see.\n\n183\n00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.960\nSo that is our forward pass,\n\n184\n00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.440\nthat what this actually shows me is\nthat through my entire project plan\n\n185\n00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:17.380\nit's probably going to actually take\n12 days as a max through that plan.\n\n186\n00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.940\nNow the problem that I have here\nis I haven't actually determined\n\n187\n00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.150\nmy critical path yet.\n\n188\n00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:27.720\nI have determined my forward pass through,\nthat shows me the overall length of\n\n189\n00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:32.360\nthe duration of my project regardless\nof what path that we have but\n\n190\n00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.700\nif I need to determine my float,\nin other words my free time,\n\n191\n00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:42.770\nmy slack in my project, I need to do\na backward pass through here as well.\n\n192\n00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:48.590\nSo now if the latest finish\nis actually gonna be day 12.\n\n193\n00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:54.610\nWell now day 12, one day that means my\nlatest start here would also be day 12.\n\n194\n00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:59.980\nSo now when we take a look at\nthe latest finish up here on task H\n\n195\n00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:07.890\nwell that could then be 11 and\nthis one down here can also be 11.\n\n196\n00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:16.060\nSo then on task H 11, 10 and\n9 is what we'll get here.\n\n197\n00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.490\nOops.\n\n198\n00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:22.210\nTry that again and\nthen for task D here, 11,\n\n199\n00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:28.460\n10, 9, 8, 7,\nif I can actually count right.\n\n200\n00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:34.748\nThat's seven, will be here, and\nnow we actually need to determine G and C.\n\n201\n00:13:34.748 --> 00:13:38.200\nSo, nine actually comes backward here,\n\n202\n00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:43.920\nwhere we actually say the latest\nfinish then is gonna be eight and\n\n203\n00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:49.080\nnow for task C, the latest finish\nhere is gonna be the day before and\n\n204\n00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.680\nthis will actually be six as well, okay?\n\n205\n00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.496\nSo when we start seeing this here.\n\n206\n00:13:55.496 --> 00:13:56.952\nOr did I count that right?\n\n207\n00:13:56.952 --> 00:14:00.230\nMake sure that I did that right.\n\n208\n00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:04.660\nIf not I did some math wrong, I started\nlooking at numbers too early sometimes and\n\n209\n00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.900\nthen I don't know what ends up happening,\nokay?\n\n210\n00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.820\nSo from this one,\nthis is where we actually, and\n\n211\n00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.704\nthis is where I made\nthe mis-determination,\n\n212\n00:14:13.704 --> 00:14:18.560\noops again, so I forgot to take into\naccount that G also effects C here.\n\n213\n00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:25.500\nSo notice that I have the late\nfinish of seven and here of eight.\n\n214\n00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:29.655\nWhich means that if I actually talk about\nthe latest finish here that can happen,\n\n215\n00:14:29.655 --> 00:14:33.381\nthe latest one can happen here is going\nto be, well that should be right,\n\n216\n00:14:33.381 --> 00:14:36.020\nsix I think is actually the right number.\n\n217\n00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.460\nLet me verify my numbers here.\n\n218\n00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.020\nLet me take a look at my cheat sheet.\n\n219\n00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.280\nNope, that's five.\n\n220\n00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:43.570\nSo I did actually miscount somewhere.\n\n221\n00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.980\nSo I actually have a cheat sheet to make\nsure I was doing my math right here.\n\n222\n00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.605\nSo this one ends up being five instead,\nand\n\n223\n00:14:50.605 --> 00:14:56.256\nthe is because of my counting here\nI would assume is what happened.\n\n224\n00:14:56.256 --> 00:15:00.583\nSo 11, 10, 9, 8, 7.\n\n225\n00:15:00.583 --> 00:15:02.473\nYeah, that's right.\n\n226\n00:15:02.473 --> 00:15:05.622\nAll right.\n\n227\n00:15:05.622 --> 00:15:07.930\nSo I don't know why I\nhave five as that number.\n\n228\n00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.150\nLet's go ahead and do that here.\n\n229\n00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.300\nAll right.\nI know exactly what I did now.\n\n230\n00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:16.270\nI finished one calculation which was for\nd, right?\n\n231\n00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.550\nWhere I determine this late start here,\nright, for seven.\n\n232\n00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:21.420\nSo Daniel hopefully you see that.\n\n233\n00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.290\nWhat I didn't do though,\nnotice this LS up here.\n\n234\n00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.420\nI did not determine this one.\n\n235\n00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.340\nSo I can't actually affect this\nnumber the way that I need to.\n\n236\n00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.970\nSo if I take a look a eight,\neight, seven, six, right.\n\n237\n00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:39.420\nSo that means that the latest\nstart here is actually day six.\n\n238\n00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.570\nNow between this, six and seven,\n\n239\n00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:47.440\nthat's what will actually affect the\nlatest finish that I can have for task C.\n\n240\n00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:52.340\nSo, when I take a look at both of those,\nwell for me to account for\n\n241\n00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:56.760\nboth, if I start on day seven,\nthat means I'm not accounting for what G.\n\n242\n00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.342\nSo that means that I actually\nhave to start this on day five.\n\n243\n00:16:00.342 --> 00:16:03.903\nSo that's where I made the mistake,\nI didn't finish one and you might say,\n\n244\n00:16:03.903 --> 00:16:05.862\nRonnie, why did you need to show us that?\n\n245\n00:16:05.862 --> 00:16:07.536\nIt's because it's a calculation,\n\n246\n00:16:07.536 --> 00:16:10.292\nwhen you do it backwards it can\nbe easily done just like I did.\n\n247\n00:16:10.292 --> 00:16:14.685\nFinished the calculation on one but\nforgot to do it on the other one and\n\n248\n00:16:14.685 --> 00:16:17.428\nthat will throw your math off completely.\n\n249\n00:16:17.428 --> 00:16:21.790\nSo, make sure you actually do account for\nboth of them if you're going to do that.\n\n250\n00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.810\nFrom this point on,\nits just simply finishing the math.\n\n251\n00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.710\nAnd, like I said, if it weren't for\nme making mathematical mistakes this\n\n252\n00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.930\nwould be perfect but\nyou know that's what happens.\n\n253\n00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:32.780\nSo five and four for task C and\n\n254\n00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:36.860\nthat leaves four and then that\nmeans that this is gonna be three.\n\n255\n00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:41.380\nAnd then three and two, and\n\n256\n00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.510\nso that actually is day two and that means\nthat the latest that this one can do\n\n257\n00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:50.420\nis day one and day one and\nlet's verify this up here at the top.\n\n258\n00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:56.190\nSo for us here on G, and\nthe late start here is six,\n\n259\n00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:00.430\nwhich means that late finish here is five,\nand this will be five.\n\n260\n00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.751\nAnd then that means\nthat this will be four.\n\n261\n00:17:03.751 --> 00:17:07.190\nFour is a late finish.\n\n262\n00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.030\nAnd, actually take\na duration of four here.\n\n263\n00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.890\nSo remember that for\nus, these two numbers,\n\n264\n00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:16.510\nright, is actually what\nwill effect this date here.\n\n265\n00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:21.220\nSo if I start on day three for\ntask A, it means what?\n\n266\n00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:26.330\nI've discounted B, so in other words,\nI need to start on day two here,\n\n267\n00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:29.640\nwhich means that the latest finish\nthat this can have is day one.\n\n268\n00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.250\nAnd One.\n\n269\n00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:37.380\nSo, without me actually\nmaking that one mistake,\n\n270\n00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.720\nit would've worked, but\nthat's what happens sometimes.\n\n271\n00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.664\nSo that's why you have to be very careful\nwhen you do both the forward pass,\n\n272\n00:17:43.664 --> 00:17:46.520\nas well as the backward\npass in doing this.\n\n273\n00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:51.040\nNow once we have this,\nwe can then take a look and\n\n274\n00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.880\ndetermine what we call\nthe float through our project.\n\n275\n00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:01.640\nSo for every single task then,\nwe need to determine if there's any float.\n\n276\n00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.020\nThe way that we do that is\nthat we take the late start,\n\n277\n00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.360\nwe subtract it from the late finish.\n\n278\n00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.520\nAnd whatever number that is,\nthat will be float.\n\n279\n00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.940\nOr you can do the late finish and\nyou subtract the early finish.\n\n280\n00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:20.050\nSo on this one here, this becomes zero and\non task E both of these\n\n281\n00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:25.110\nactually indicate that it becomes two and\nthis one right here also becomes two.\n\n282\n00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:30.480\nAnd this one right here is zero,\n\n283\n00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.490\nand this one right here is zero and\nthis one here is zero.\n\n284\n00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:41.970\nAnd then if we come back down here to\nthe Task B, this is gonna be zero.\n\n285\n00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:42.570\nOops, maybe.\n\n286\n00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:48.640\nAnd this one here is zero,\n\n287\n00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:51.710\nAnd now this one right here\nthough is actually what?\n\n288\n00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:54.300\nOne is what we'll end up seeing.\n\n289\n00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.865\nNow you may wonder like what\nin the world is this about?\n\n290\n00:18:56.865 --> 00:18:58.800\nWell let me show you, okay?\n\n291\n00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:04.470\nSo our critical path\nhere starts at Task A.\n\n292\n00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:06.190\nOops, that's not what I wanted was it?\n\n293\n00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:06.815\nWell, not really.\n\n294\n00:19:06.815 --> 00:19:12.401\n[LAUGH]\nI think, it'll work.Okay.\n\n295\n00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:18.180\nStarts at task A,\ncomes down to task B, goes this way,\n\n296\n00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:24.000\nand then down to I and\ncomes across like this.\n\n297\n00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:29.920\nSo if I needed to find my longest path,\nuninterrupted path without\n\n298\n00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:35.030\nany float time, That I know that\nif anything effects task A, B, C,\n\n299\n00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:40.300\nG, H, not really I so much, but G and H.\n\n300\n00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.450\nAnything that actually delays that will\nend up delaying my overall finish.\n\n301\n00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:47.200\nAll these other two here,\nespecially this other one with two and\n\n302\n00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.910\ntwo here, when you start seeing those,\nthat gives me the ability to actually\n\n303\n00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:54.400\nmanage that float a little\nbit if I need to.\n\n304\n00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:59.450\nBut I know that I can actually make\nadjustments to my project plan along here.\n\n305\n00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:03.440\nAnd it's not gonna actually\naffect my project plan adversely.\n\n306\n00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.470\nActually if I can start any of these two\nlike E or F early which I can't really\n\n307\n00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:12.170\nstart E in the earlier than it does but\nF here I can possibly start\n\n308\n00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:17.600\nearlier or end up affecting it where\ntask G may be able to start earlier.\n\n309\n00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.250\nThen I can actually effect\nthe overall duration.\n\n310\n00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.290\nSame thing with D as well.\n\n311\n00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:26.780\nSo it does take a little bit of math and\nyou do have actually complete the math and\n\n312\n00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:31.020\nthat's where I want to show you\na little bit of more complex topic for\n\n313\n00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.400\nus to take a look at.\n\n314\n00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.440\nBut it is something that we\nhave to be able to determine.\n\n315\n00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.370\nEvery project manager is going to have to\ndo something fairly similar to this, and\n\n316\n00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:42.250\nso by doing it like this\nis it will make it easy.\n\n317\n00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.150\nSometimes you can also do this, of course,\n\n318\n00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:48.150\nin the format of just a couple of tables\nif you want to, but this is normally\n\n319\n00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:51.700\nthe method that you generally see it in,\nwritten out in a diagram and\n\n320\n00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.620\nnormally along your gant chart,\nat least in that format.\n\n321\n00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.962\nIs normally how we graphically\ndisplay it a little bit easier.\n\n322\n00:20:57.962 --> 00:21:01.520\nSo determining something like this is one\nof those methods that will really help you\n\n323\n00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.760\nto determine the overall estimate for\nthe entire project plan rather than just\n\n324\n00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.640\na task duration estimate in what we've\nbeen talking on in a previous episode.\n\n325\n00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.190\n>> Well, Ronnie,\n\n326\n00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:15.420\nif I've learned anything from this type\nof methodology for estimating duration,\n\n327\n00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.019\nit's that I need to stick with things\nlike expert judgement and Gant charts.\n\n328\n00:21:18.019 --> 00:21:20.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz math, we've talked about it,\n\n329\n00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:22.250\nwe've made fun of me.\n\n330\n00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:26.190\nIf you have trouble with math, this is\nprobably gonna be a difficult thing for\n\n331\n00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:29.310\nyou because it's easy to make a little\nmistake and then everything's off.\n\n332\n00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.960\nAnd especially, this is a very simplified\n\n333\n00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.210\nversion of this is what Ronnie is\nshowing you so that you get the concept.\n\n334\n00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:38.540\nIt becomes infinitely more\ncomplex as real numbers and\n\n335\n00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.970\nreal tasks start getting\nthrown into the mix.\n\n336\n00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.370\nSo, if you can keep it\nas simple as possible,\n\n337\n00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:44.500\nthat's definitely the best way to go.\n\n338\n00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.810\nBut, Ronnie maybe you've got some other\nmethods that I can sink my teeth into and\n\n339\n00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:50.930\nuse instead.\n\n340\n00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.090\n>> We do.\nWe need to take a look at what this\n\n341\n00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:57.960\nactually reveals to us, in the very end\nwhen we start figuring out all of our\n\n342\n00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:02.260\nestimates and everything is\nthat we'll find out something.\n\n343\n00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.220\nThe estimates normally don't really\n\n344\n00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.290\nlend much cretinous to what we\nsaid was the original end date.\n\n345\n00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.970\nAll of us can have a great\nidea here that say,\n\n346\n00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.030\nI know I can accomplish this by this date.\n\n347\n00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.130\nYou do the estimates.\n\n348\n00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:19.270\nUse any of those that we've talked about\nand all of a sudden when you start\n\n349\n00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:21.610\nplugging in numbers is ten\ndays later than you thought?\n\n350\n00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:23.820\nThat's a little bit hefty, right?\n\n351\n00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.110\nYou've already told everybody,\nI know I can finish it by this date.\n\n352\n00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:30.360\nWell the reality is what we've\nmentioned in earlier episodes, right?\n\n353\n00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:34.480\nWhen you're actually doing the initiation\nis that you need to emphasize\n\n354\n00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.570\nthat this is an estimate, okay.\n\n355\n00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:40.590\nThat this is not locked in\nstone right now because well,\n\n356\n00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:42.170\nyou haven't even started the project yet.\n\n357\n00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.920\nYou haven't even considered\nany of the estimates.\n\n358\n00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.160\nYou're just saying that you can, so that's\none of the things you wanna do is you can\n\n359\n00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.750\nsay I can estimate that it\nwill be done by June 1st.\n\n360\n00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:56.326\n>> And due to the fact that we are not\nclairvoyants, [LAUGH] and that's all it\n\n361\n00:22:56.326 --> 00:23:01.530\ncould ever be is an estimation of what\nyou think and predict that the future\n\n362\n00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:05.660\nwill hold for you cuz you never know what\ncould come in and slow the project down.\n\n363\n00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.890\nWe just don't have that\nkind of ability to do.\n\n364\n00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.220\n>> Now once we have the estimates though,\n\n365\n00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:15.330\nthere are things that we can do\nespecially if we have good estimates.\n\n366\n00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:19.830\nAnd so now you can actually take those\nestimates and you can apply them to your\n\n367\n00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:24.310\nproject plan and then be able to control\nthe scheduling a little bit more and\n\n368\n00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:26.350\nmake sure that those\ndurations are actually good.\n\n369\n00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.840\nLet me show you three different methods\nthat's actually gonna really help you\n\n370\n00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.870\nonce you have the estimates on hand.\n\n371\n00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.820\nNow if you don't have estimates there's\nno use in you talking about these but\n\n372\n00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.970\nonce you have things like the estimates\nin hand you can start manipulating and\n\n373\n00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:42.310\nseeing the project plan graphically but\nactually doing some things that will help.\n\n374\n00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:45.360\nWe already just talked about\nthis just briefly here.\n\n375\n00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.940\nWhat we talk about is float management.\n\n376\n00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:52.620\nIf I have the critical path right here,\nokay.\n\n377\n00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:56.240\nWhat I can do is I can\nmanage this float here.\n\n378\n00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.480\nThese day twos and this day one overall.\n\n379\n00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.300\nWhere what I might be able to do, right?\n\n380\n00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:08.931\nIs to adjust the schedule let's say of\nF to start a day earlier if I need to.\n\n381\n00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:11.475\nAnd then see what that actually does,\nokay.\n\n382\n00:24:11.475 --> 00:24:12.693\nAnd see what happens there.\n\n383\n00:24:12.693 --> 00:24:17.298\nOr I might be able to delay, let's say,\nanother task so that something else can\n\n384\n00:24:17.298 --> 00:24:21.590\nactually start and that way we\nactually adjust the plan as well.\n\n385\n00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:25.950\nNow this is not something that you\njust do on a whim basis, right.\n\n386\n00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:28.850\nYou really have to do a little bit\nmore strategic planning than what\n\n387\n00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:29.980\nI've done here.\n\n388\n00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.880\nTo actually say yes this actually\nadjustment will end up working and\n\n389\n00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.190\nwill end up affecting the project plan.\n\n390\n00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:39.070\nBut just kinda realize that if you're\nactually to adjust anywhere, right.\n\n391\n00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:42.710\nIt's actually gonna be right there\nin that float is to manage that.\n\n392\n00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:43.920\nNow remember that what I said,\n\n393\n00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.460\nis that normally when you actually\nadjust anything along here?\n\n394\n00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:50.530\nIt's gonna affect the overall project plan\nduration and normally it affects it for\n\n395\n00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:51.700\nthe adverse.\n\n396\n00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.450\nBut there are things that you may\nbe able to do along here though,\n\n397\n00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:56.520\nin which you can affect and\n\n398\n00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:00.950\nactually make the actual duration a little\nbit shorter if that's what's planned for.\n\n399\n00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:02.620\nBut, you have to actually measure out and\n\n400\n00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:06.780\nsee if everything can be done\nin the way that you need it to.\n\n401\n00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:10.350\nSecond idea though,\nis this idea of crashing the plan,\n\n402\n00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:14.130\nand you do wanna know that terminology,\nespecially for the exam.\n\n403\n00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:18.110\nNow, I was trying to describe it to\nDaniel, like this is what we do.\n\n404\n00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:22.100\nWe can actually start allocating overtime,\nright.\n\n405\n00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:26.134\nSo, if that particular\nactivity that we're on, okay.\n\n406\n00:25:26.134 --> 00:25:31.020\nSays hey, we're not going to finish\non time and I go to Daniel and\n\n407\n00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.030\nsay Daniel what do you need?\n\n408\n00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:33.680\nAnd he says, I need another set of hands.\n\n409\n00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.770\nI can go ahead and sign for overtime and\nsay all right, you can keep so\n\n410\n00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:41.340\nand so, Steve, and\nyou all can work overtime on this, and\n\n411\n00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.060\nmake sure that overtime's allotted.\n\n412\n00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.480\nAnd that way, that extra set of\nhands really does help Daniel out.\n\n413\n00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.870\nBut when it comes down to\ncrashing the plan, I told Daniel,\n\n414\n00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:51.450\nI said the simplest thing is us, okay.\n\n415\n00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:54.740\nWe're simply throwing money at it\nuntil I get the result that I want.\n\n416\n00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.340\nThat's crashing the plan, okay?\n\n417\n00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.090\nSo Daniel says it's gonna take me\nsix days, I say I need it in four.\n\n418\n00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.460\nAnd Daniel says no way.\n\n419\n00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.640\nI say tell me what you need, and\n\n420\n00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.720\nDaniel tells me what he needs to\naccomplish it in four, and I say yes.\n\n421\n00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.070\n>> This is my favorite model.\n\n422\n00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:10.970\n[LAUGH] Just give me all the money and\nresources I need to get this done.\n\n423\n00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:11.970\n>> Now when you do that,\n\n424\n00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:16.090\nright, now you have to go okay,\ncan I actually afford to crash the plan?\n\n425\n00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:17.240\nSometimes you will, right?\n\n426\n00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.320\nThe good thing is we'll talk\nabout contingencies later on\n\n427\n00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.670\nthat you will actually be able to say,\nyes I can afford to spend that.\n\n428\n00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:25.840\nA lot of times though when\nyou're working on a budget,\n\n429\n00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:30.100\nthat idea of crashing the plan is\nonly break in case of emergency.\n\n430\n00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.340\nAnd that's what you have to realize.\n\n431\n00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:35.290\nIf you crashed a plan early on in your\nproject, you're really saying that\n\n432\n00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:38.590\nthis had to happen or there was\nreally nothing else that I could do.\n\n433\n00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.400\nYou really want to make sure\nthat that is absolutely\n\n434\n00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.200\nyour last ditch effort in doing it.\n\n435\n00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.684\nNow, usually the other one that\nis really preferred here, right.\n\n436\n00:26:47.684 --> 00:26:48.990\nIs what we call fast tracking.\n\n437\n00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:53.000\nNow you can try and fast track everything.\n\n438\n00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.420\nBut when you do so you gotta realize\nthat's gonna play havoc again on resources\n\n439\n00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.210\nis what's gonna happen, and\nyour costs are gonna go up.\n\n440\n00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:03.880\nAll of these, no matter what you do,\nright, they will affect that\n\n441\n00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.700\nproject triangle, the constraints\nthat we talked about, right?\n\n442\n00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:10.510\nTime, cost or the requirements\nis what will end up happening.\n\n443\n00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:13.750\nYou fast track something,\nwhat essentially are you gonna do, okay?\n\n444\n00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:18.020\nWhat your saying is look,\nI wanna make sure that If I can't,\n\n445\n00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.960\neverything that needs, that can,\nnot everything that needs.\n\n446\n00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.830\nEverything that can start simultaneously,\nwill start.\n\n447\n00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:29.140\nIn other words, I need to check and\nverify dependencies are not there.\n\n448\n00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.360\nThat everything that need\nto starts simultaneously so\n\n449\n00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.340\nthat I can actually reduce\nthe overall duration of the plan,\n\n450\n00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:38.380\nI will fast track that and do that and\nmake sure that they start simultaneously.\n\n451\n00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.814\nAnd once you start doing that and\nyou have a limited number of resources,\n\n452\n00:27:41.814 --> 00:27:43.950\nremember what will happen, right?\n\n453\n00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:47.870\nIf we start saying look, we're going\nto do this and effect the time.\n\n454\n00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:49.085\nRemember what that actually affects.\n\n455\n00:27:49.085 --> 00:27:51.950\nIt drives up your cost because\nnow something you planned for\n\n456\n00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:54.735\nthat only has two people working at\none time now may have four, okay.\n\n457\n00:27:54.735 --> 00:27:59.770\nWell, your cost will go off for that time\nperiod and also when you fast track things\n\n458\n00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:05.410\nit's less as, is more likely I make sure\nI say this, is more likely that you may\n\n459\n00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:08.960\nfind out that because you are on the fast\ntrack, that requirements maybe missed.\n\n460\n00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.010\nIn other words, somebody just doesn't dot\nall the I's and crosses all the T's and\n\n461\n00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:14.790\ndoesn't do everything that they need to.\n\n462\n00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:17.340\nAnd now you have a product\nthat the quality of it\n\n463\n00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:20.640\nis not what's up to expectations\nwhich means you have to do it again.\n\n464\n00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.900\nSo you do need to be careful about\nthe idea of fast tracking here.\n\n465\n00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.740\nCrashing is by far is the element\nthat just costs more, but\n\n466\n00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:29.800\nremember what happens, right?\n\n467\n00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.500\nWhen you say look,\nI'm gonna crash this plan.\n\n468\n00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.890\nYou are actually going to\naffect everything else, right,\n\n469\n00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:37.530\nbecause what you're saying\nis let me throw money at it.\n\n470\n00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:38.600\nUntil it actually works.\n\n471\n00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.690\nWell, remember in that project triangle,\n\n472\n00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:43.730\nyou can throw on the money out if\nyou actually emphasizing that.\n\n473\n00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:47.510\nBut remember that doesn't always guarantee\nthat you're actually gonna get the best\n\n474\n00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:50.510\nquality because you're now saying\nI'm doing this because of time,\n\n475\n00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:51.390\nI need to do it.\n\n476\n00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:55.060\nAnd then also it doesn't guarantee\nthat every worker actually going to do\n\n477\n00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.070\neverything that they need to,\nthey could just go,\n\n478\n00:28:57.070 --> 00:29:00.010\nyeah I'd love the overtime and\nnot help Daniel out at all.\n\n479\n00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:02.015\nI mean that could end up happening.\n\n480\n00:29:02.015 --> 00:29:05.370\nFloat management again is all about\ntaking a look at entire critical path,\n\n481\n00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:08.320\nand saying what can I\nactually affect here.\n\n482\n00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.610\nAnd figure out how I can manage\nthis float a little bit better.\n\n483\n00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:14.030\nNow there is other methods\nthat we can actually use, and\n\n484\n00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:15.830\nwe'll talk about one in another episode.\n\n485\n00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:18.420\nHere, we'll talk about\nthe critical chain method.\n\n486\n00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:21.480\nWe're actually managing buffers instead,\nbut overall though,\n\n487\n00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:25.330\nyou're actually starting to see, here's\nhow you begin to manage the duration.\n\n488\n00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:27.810\nNow remember, everything that\nwe've done here at this point,\n\n489\n00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.580\ndoesn't actually have any\nresources assigned to it, so\n\n490\n00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:33.720\nwe don't really know how those\nthings are actually gonna work out.\n\n491\n00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.510\nThis is all about estimates,\nis what this one is all about, and\n\n492\n00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:38.602\nthat's pretty much to key.\n\n493\n00:29:38.602 --> 00:29:40.690\nSo in other words, it's ideal, right?\n\n494\n00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:42.750\nWe don't have anything going on.\n\n495\n00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:46.300\nIt's the greatest time for you to actually\nadjust the schedule and to work with it.\n\n496\n00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.180\nMassage it as deep as you can.\n\n497\n00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:51.385\nBecause then you'll add in more elements\nthat's just going to blow it out again.\n\n498\n00:29:51.385 --> 00:29:54.290\nBut, you're compressing everything\nthat you can at this point.\n\n499\n00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:56.790\nGetting it as efficient\nas you possibly can here.\n\n500\n00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:59.560\nAnd then when you start adding in\nother elements you'll see it'll start\n\n501\n00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.370\nexpanding back out.\n\n502\n00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:01.380\nIt's like using that sponge.\n\n503\n00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:02.740\nRight?\nYou want to make sure you wring\n\n504\n00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:03.240\nit all out.\n\n505\n00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.930\nAnd then you can wipe it up again.\n\n506\n00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.610\nAnd that's what has to happen with your\nproject plan before you ever get it\n\n507\n00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:09.710\nactually in action multiple times.\n\n508\n00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:13.130\n>> Just there, our best guest there\nis basically what that boils down to,\n\n509\n00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:16.730\nwhich one of these things are gonna help\nyou get that best guest?, all right,\n\n510\n00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:19.710\nbest guest that is quite essential.\n\n511\n00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:21.710\n>> It is.\n>> [LAUGH] And\n\n512\n00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:25.800\nso work to learn them obviously cuz you're\ngonna need to know them for the exam.\n\n513\n00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.870\nBut find the ones that work well for you\nif you are a project manager and implement\n\n514\n00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:32.680\nthat because the better you get at it\nthe more accurate they're gonna become.\n\n515\n00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.680\nAnd the more accurate you're gonna\nbecome in your project estimation for\n\n516\n00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.280\nyour duration of activity.\n\n517\n00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.490\nAnd yes I did say that in one take.\n\n518\n00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:40.030\n>> Yes you did, very good.\n\n519\n00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:41.360\n>> That being said Ronnie, thanks for\n\n520\n00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:45.100\njoining us again today and\nexplaining these methodologies for us.\n\n521\n00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.560\nAnd thank you guys for watching,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n522\n00:30:47.560 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.534 --> 00:00:19.234\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.234 --> 00:00:21.455\nwe are continuing on\nwith our Project+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.455 --> 00:00:25.294\nJoining me in the studio today\nto lend that very large brain of\n\n6\n00:00:25.294 --> 00:00:29.073\nproject management to us,\nis none other than Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:29.073 --> 00:00:30.728\nRonnie, welcome to the show sir,\nhow are you doing today?\n\n8\n00:00:30.728 --> 00:00:34.143\n>> Well, thank you again for\ninviting me back on the show as we\n\n9\n00:00:34.143 --> 00:00:37.530\ncontinue on to take a look\nat Comptia's Project+.\n\n10\n00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.440\nAnd we're moving in to the area of\nwhat we call logical diagramming, and\n\n11\n00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.480\nwe need to make sure that we understand\nhow to set up logical diagramming.\n\n12\n00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.550\nNow in the way that are shows or\n\n13\n00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.350\nending up being recorded here, they're not\nactually recorded in any logical order.\n\n14\n00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.030\nI'm actually just following the order\nthat's actually in the exam objectives,\n\n15\n00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.780\nand so we find out something,\nthat this show you gonna say, wow,\n\n16\n00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.380\nif you're trying to watch them in\nthe order of the exam objectives\n\n17\n00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.690\nit's not gonna make a lot of sense.\n\n18\n00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.730\n>> The irony hopefully is not lost on you.\n\n19\n00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:07.970\nThis is funny,\n\n20\n00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.677\nthis show is setting up logical\ndiagramming which is in no logical order.\n\n21\n00:01:12.677 --> 00:01:16.060\n[LAUGH] Just irony figured out there.\n\n22\n00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.450\n>> There's no doubt that\nsometimes this does happen.\n\n23\n00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.330\nSo what should end up happening,\nis as we set everything up,\n\n24\n00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.810\nthis is prior to show that if you were\nstarting to create your project plan.\n\n25\n00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.950\nToo many p's in a project plan.\n\n26\n00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.260\n>> That's right.\n>> That's what it comes down to.\n\n27\n00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.160\nIn project planning,\nwell especially when you start setting up\n\n28\n00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.340\nthe schedule to your project, this is one\nof the first things that you will do.\n\n29\n00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.890\nNow we've actually recorded\nin other episodes,\n\n30\n00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.400\nI'm not just gonna say previous episodes,\nI'm gonna now start saying other episodes,\n\n31\n00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.150\nwhere we talk about trying to\nestimate activity durations, right?\n\n32\n00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.300\nAnd that actually sets up our ability\nto set up a project schedule overall.\n\n33\n00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.520\nAnd we even talked about how we do that,\nso we've gone over some of the different\n\n34\n00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.400\nmethods that we've used\nto help us set that up.\n\n35\n00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.800\nBut in all reality,\n\n36\n00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.440\nwhat normally happens when we start trying\nto get everything set up and especially\n\n37\n00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.740\nestimating the activity durations,\nit comes in the form of a process.\n\n38\n00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.810\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n39\n00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.340\ntake a look at what we actually talk\nabout as far as that process goes.\n\n40\n00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.690\nSo I went in and\ncreated a diagram right here, to try and\n\n41\n00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.820\nmake the logical flow a little bit better.\n\n42\n00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:34.800\nSo previously, in other episodes,\nokay we've talked about,\n\n43\n00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.800\nsome of the things that we do\nin activity duration estimates.\n\n44\n00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.270\nSo we showed you how you can actually take\nan activity, and try and do an estimate or\n\n45\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.510\nan expected value in those\nestimates as well, and\n\n46\n00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.510\nwe actually used several\nof these tools right here.\n\n47\n00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.050\nThe analogous, the expert judgment,\nparametric type of estimations, three\n\n48\n00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.440\npoint analysis that we may take along,\nand then even the idea of PERT as well.\n\n49\n00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.300\nWe haven't talked about GERT,\nwe'll get into that in this episode today.\n\n50\n00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.820\nSo we've talked about that.\n\n51\n00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.880\nWe've even talked about the beginning\nhere, creating a project schedule.\n\n52\n00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.010\nAnd one of the key ways we do that is by\ntrying to determine the longest overall\n\n53\n00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.690\nuninterrupted path from the very beginning\nof our project, as much as possible.\n\n54\n00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.560\nAll the way through the end\nof our project, and\n\n55\n00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.080\nthat way we know that critical path that\nsays any place along that particular path\n\n56\n00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.970\nthat gets delayed is ultimately\ngonna delay our entire project.\n\n57\n00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.650\nSo we've done that already.\n\n58\n00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.510\nThe funny thing is, we didn't do\nwhat's actually at the top here,\n\n59\n00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.900\nDaniel, which is\nNetwork Diagramming Methods.\n\n60\n00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.330\nAnd this logically helps us to see\nhow tasks are connected together.\n\n61\n00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.470\nSo, when it lays out, in all reality,\nas you start doing this,\n\n62\n00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.210\nmost of us would actually just go,\nall right, so, if I'm gonna try and\n\n63\n00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:57.330\nplan out my projects schedule, I need to\nsee what activities really do need to go,\n\n64\n00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.610\none after the other, and lay them\nout logically from the beginning of\n\n65\n00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.650\nthe project All the way to the end of\nthe project is what we need to do.\n\n66\n00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.660\nAnd so\n\n67\n00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.810\nwe're actually focusing on this one kind\nof out of the sequence in the series here.\n\n68\n00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.260\nInstead and we're gonna take a look at how\nwe actually do set up logical diagramming\n\n69\n00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.160\nso we can at least logically go out,\nhere's what actually goes here,\n\n70\n00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.230\nthen from that point, once you have\nthat set up, the logical diagraming.\n\n71\n00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.640\nNow you can take each of those activities\nand start to actually do the activity\n\n72\n00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.440\nduration, because now you\nare making logical sense.\n\n73\n00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.520\nRight.\nYou now know how they will lay out.\n\n74\n00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.160\nNow you can actually go okay, so\nif this actually goes here and\n\n75\n00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.950\nI've actually already completed all this.\n\n76\n00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.110\nThat can help me to figure out where\nmy duration estimates are, and\n\n77\n00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.330\nthen ultimately, you end up creating\nthe entire project schedule.\n\n78\n00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.670\nSo even though the recording of our\nshows were not exactly in order,\n\n79\n00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.270\nthey do make sense when actually\ndo put them all together.\n\n80\n00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.820\nIn this one we are focusing\non this first part here, and\n\n81\n00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.710\na little bit on the other ones as well.\n\n82\n00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:00.250\nOkay?\n\n83\n00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.670\nSo that's where we're actually going.\n\n84\n00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.860\nSo today, we're actually going to take\na look then at some of the different\n\n85\n00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.220\nlogical diagramming methods.\n\n86\n00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.820\nThat we can actually take a look at here.\n\n87\n00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.670\nPDM, ADM, and CDM here.\n\n88\n00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.510\nYes we are in the plethora of acronyms.\n\n89\n00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.310\nIt's definitely not going to be tongue\ntying, I can guarantee you that.\n\n90\n00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.150\nNo, it definitely will.\n\n91\n00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.080\nSo, you actually end up seeing the usage\nof all three of these at some point.\n\n92\n00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.820\nSo, let's go ahead and dive in and take\na look at some of the different types of\n\n93\n00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.470\nlogical diagramming that you and I will\nactually end up seeing out here too, okay?\n\n94\n00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.230\nSo, we're gonna focus in on these\ndifferent diagramming methods, and\n\n95\n00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.270\nwe'll start off with the most popular one,\ncalled PDM.\n\n96\n00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.950\nSo when we take a look at the idea of\nusing PDM, it actually does stand for\n\n97\n00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.890\nprecedence diagramming method,\nor diagram method, here.\n\n98\n00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.020\nWhen we take a look at this one, somebody\nat some point in time in the past said,\n\n99\n00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.290\nhere's how we represent activities.\n\n100\n00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.950\nWe're gonna actually create boxes or\nrectangles\n\n101\n00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:09.080\nthat will represent the activity and what\nwe believe the duration will be, okay?\n\n102\n00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.300\nSo we essentially take a diagram and\nwe make a box, and then,\n\n103\n00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.060\nwhen we start actually\nlaying out other activities.\n\n104\n00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.830\nWe can lay them out across a sheet\nof paper if we need to manually, and\n\n105\n00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.790\nfrom that point,\nwe draw arrows to show the connections.\n\n106\n00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:25.650\nNow in this one.\n\n107\n00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.830\nRemember that the boxes do represent\nactivities or individual tasks.\n\n108\n00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.240\nAnd the arrows represent what we\ncall connections and dependencies.\n\n109\n00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.440\nSo notice when we take a look at these\narrows, what we're actually saying here is\n\n110\n00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:46.420\ntask C is really dependent on task\nA actually being done a lot of times.\n\n111\n00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.970\nActually completing in\nthe way that it needs to.\n\n112\n00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.630\nNow you'll also hear two different terms,\nand I put these here parenthesis,\n\n113\n00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:59.540\nthat you may also hear is a term\npredecessor and also successor, okay.\n\n114\n00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.090\nSo, remember that what happens\nhere is that task A proceeds\n\n115\n00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.610\ntask C and proceeds task B, okay.\n\n116\n00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.840\nBut A can also have a successor in the\nvery fact that task B can be a successor.\n\n117\n00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.800\nAnd of course this also means that\ntask C ca be a successor as well.\n\n118\n00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.850\nSo that type of terminology you're\nlikely to hear in project planning.\n\n119\n00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.680\nThe majority of the times if you end up\nusing a project management information\n\n120\n00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.650\nsystem software that helps you to\ndevelop this type of diagramming here,\n\n121\n00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.850\nyou're gonna end up seeing this as being\none of the most popular methods that's out\n\n122\n00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:36.840\nthere, okay?\n\n123\n00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:41.013\nMost of the project management software\nthat you run into, it tends to use\n\n124\n00:07:41.013 --> 00:07:45.323\nthis because that's what happens is\nthat everybody has kind of migrated and\n\n125\n00:07:45.323 --> 00:07:49.522\nreally did glom on to this particular\ntype of diagramming method, okay?\n\n126\n00:07:49.522 --> 00:07:54.981\nThe other thing that you'll also\nhear when using this is you may\n\n127\n00:07:54.981 --> 00:08:00.245\nhear the idea of people referring\nto the AON diagram as well.\n\n128\n00:08:00.245 --> 00:08:03.242\nWhich means Activity on the Node.\n\n129\n00:08:03.242 --> 00:08:06.810\nWhat they're actually taking a look\nhere is that they are saying that look\n\n130\n00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.170\nthese boxes essentially\nrepresent nodes and\n\n131\n00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.960\nthey represent activities\nis what they represent.\n\n132\n00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.930\nSo, it actually is fairly easy for\nyou to do this.\n\n133\n00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.210\nMost of the time where I end up seeing\nthis logically a lot of times is\n\n134\n00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.820\nthere is a whiteboard and\nthere's two different methods.\n\n135\n00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:26.812\nEither people are actually making\nthe boxes themselves, drawing them on, or\n\n136\n00:08:26.812 --> 00:08:29.728\nthey're simply using things\nlike Post It notes, okay?\n\n137\n00:08:29.728 --> 00:08:33.307\nAnd actually just putting them on\nthe board as they go along and just,\n\n138\n00:08:33.307 --> 00:08:34.070\nstacking up.\n\n139\n00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.770\nAnd then on the board, the whiteboard\nitself, they're actually drawing these\n\n140\n00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:41.120\nlinks in between because it's very\neasy instead to actually kind of\n\n141\n00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.520\nerase the links, move a Post It note\nfrom one location to the other.\n\n142\n00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.850\nSo that they can show the method, and then\nat the end, they take a picture of it or\n\n143\n00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:53.630\nthey make sure that nobody touches\nthat board, in the end here.\n\n144\n00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:56.050\nSo, that's what you're\nnormally seeing here.\n\n145\n00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:00.976\nAnd this is again, by far the most popular\nmethod of setting up a logical diagram.\n\n146\n00:09:00.976 --> 00:09:04.090\n>> Yeah, Ronnie, actually it reminds\nme a lot of when you watch movies about\n\n147\n00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.180\nthe FBI and\nthey're going after the mafia or\n\n148\n00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.920\nsome organized crime, and\norganizational criminal entity.\n\n149\n00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.300\nThey've got that board put up where\nthere's pictures of everybody and\n\n150\n00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.600\nwho's the highest levels and\nit's really what it reminds me of and\n\n151\n00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.525\nthen when somebody gets you\nknow taken out or whatever.\n\n152\n00:09:21.525 --> 00:09:25.385\nThis guy's now a head of this crime family\nand they move him to where he needs to be.\n\n153\n00:09:25.385 --> 00:09:28.878\nKinda the same idea, except this is\nwith activities and not crime bosses.\n\n154\n00:09:28.878 --> 00:09:31.145\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you tend to see this, right?\n\n155\n00:09:31.145 --> 00:09:32.375\nAnd the reason why they're doing that,\n\n156\n00:09:32.375 --> 00:09:35.085\nright, if you actually watch\nvery popular TV shows you\n\n157\n00:09:35.085 --> 00:09:38.865\nhear it called the murder board or\nthe unsub board or stuff like that.\n\n158\n00:09:38.865 --> 00:09:42.140\nThey're trying to figure out\nthe logical relationship.\n\n159\n00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.420\nHow do they link this one person\nall the way over to this one task?\n\n160\n00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.760\nHere we're just trying to make sure that\nwe have every activity that we know of\n\n161\n00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.310\nthat's going to affect our project or\nbe a part of our project up on the board.\n\n162\n00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:59.000\nWell, I can go ahead and write out 50 or\n60 different activities, but\n\n163\n00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.180\nit doesn't mean that I understand\nwhat has to go after the other one.\n\n164\n00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.780\nSo it's better for me then to be\nable to move those things around and\n\n165\n00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.260\nset them up to now where I\ncan actually logically go.\n\n166\n00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.920\nIf task A, okay, right in front of me,\n\n167\n00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.140\nhas to be done before these two\ntasks have to be done or can begin,\n\n168\n00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.000\nthen you can move those things around and\nstart seeing the logical diagramming.\n\n169\n00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.560\nAnd that's very important, right,\n\n170\n00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.550\nwhen we're trying to now set\nup activity durations, right.\n\n171\n00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:30.810\nIf I know that task A takes ten days\nto actually complete the task, well,\n\n172\n00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:35.270\nthat logically now means that if I can\nconnect those directly to task B and C,\n\n173\n00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:39.200\nI know what those have to\nsomewhere along the line.\n\n174\n00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.160\nStart at the earliest, right?\n\n175\n00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:46.440\nWe talk about the earliest start here\nof day 11 of whatever my project is.\n\n176\n00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.970\nI can't just go, well okay task A is\nten days duration but I can go and\n\n177\n00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.650\nstart task B and\nC if I want to any time during that time.\n\n178\n00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.730\nWell, it may not work out that way.\n\n179\n00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:00.800\nSo, that's where that logical\ndiagramming really does come in and\n\n180\n00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.690\nthis is by far the more popular\nmethod that you'll see.\n\n181\n00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:08.433\nThe example that I used in another episode\nright, is to pull up Microsoft Project.\n\n182\n00:11:08.433 --> 00:11:12.252\nAnd Microsoft Project uses this as their\ndiagraming method to help us to see\n\n183\n00:11:12.252 --> 00:11:15.780\nthe Gantt chart that we see and\nmost Gantt charts are set up like this.\n\n184\n00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.578\nNot that you can't change them, but\n\n185\n00:11:17.578 --> 00:11:20.652\nusually the default is actually\nthis particular method here or\n\n186\n00:11:20.652 --> 00:11:24.540\nthe activities that we talk about are\nactually on the nodes themselves, okay.\n\n187\n00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.620\nSo that's just one method but\nit is the most popular one.\n\n188\n00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.230\nThe other one is a little\nbit more unusual and\n\n189\n00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.690\nlet's talk about this one for a moment.\n\n190\n00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:37.170\nWhich is what we call\nthe Arrow Diagraming Method, or\n\n191\n00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.220\nthe Arrow Diagram Method as well, okay?\n\n192\n00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:46.710\nNow this kinda flips the Precedence\nDiagram Method on its heels a little bit.\n\n193\n00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.760\nIn other words, what we have now is not\nthat the activities themselves are on\n\n194\n00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:58.530\nthe little nodes but the arrows actually\nrepresent the activities themselves.\n\n195\n00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:02.130\nIn other words, they're saying it\nrepresents the duration of an activity.\n\n196\n00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:05.560\nSo normally you see something like\nTask A and actually list ten days or\n\n197\n00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.720\nfive days along with it.\n\n198\n00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.230\nAnd what are each of these points?\n\n199\n00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.400\nEach of these points are essentially\nstops, they're connectors for\n\n200\n00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.020\nus to be able to move through this.\n\n201\n00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.380\nSo they've actually just flipped the whole\nthing in the opposite direction.\n\n202\n00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.690\nAnd this allows for\nmore riding than anything else, right?\n\n203\n00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:27.200\nYou actually just show hey here's what\nthe activity is, is that this arrows.\n\n204\n00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.528\nAnd then between you\nmight have a stop point.\n\n205\n00:12:29.528 --> 00:12:31.755\nSo you might see a start and a finish and\n\n206\n00:12:31.755 --> 00:12:35.320\nthen the start of another\nactivities is actually over here.\n\n207\n00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:40.019\nAnd so it's still the same diagram as what\nI had before, but now you actually see\n\n208\n00:12:40.019 --> 00:12:44.440\nwhere the tasks themselves\nare represented by these activities.\n\n209\n00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.690\nSo this is where you might also\nhear the term AOA instead,\n\n210\n00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.370\nwhich is that the activities\nare on the arrows.\n\n211\n00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:56.590\nThis one, you may see, but not as common\nas the precedence diagramming method.\n\n212\n00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.960\nDoes it still represent\nthe logical representation?\n\n213\n00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.790\nYes, it still does.\n\n214\n00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:05.170\nSo this one, though,\nas much as you might still see it,\n\n215\n00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:09.360\nit does have kind of a drawback to it,\nin that it doesn't really allow\n\n216\n00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.520\nyou to show the logical dependencies\nbetween them, a lot of times.\n\n217\n00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.950\nSo, whereas the precedence one which\nwe took a look at another episode.\n\n218\n00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:21.830\nWhere we could see the finish to start\nconnections, the start to start,\n\n219\n00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:25.020\nthe finish to finish,\nas well as the start to finish.\n\n220\n00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:29.170\nHere it's much more difficult to show\nthat on these types of arrow diagrams.\n\n221\n00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:29.890\nCan it be done?\n\n222\n00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.570\nYes, but\nyou're actually drawing a lot more loops.\n\n223\n00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.400\nSo where you tend to see this\nmore often is when you do have,\n\n224\n00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.680\nnot conditional loops, but,\nprocess loops, instead.\n\n225\n00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.430\nWhere you're actually just trying to say,\nall right, task B finishes,\n\n226\n00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:43.980\nbut if task, not if, but\n\n227\n00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:47.820\nwhen task B finishes it also has to go\nthrough this task, and this task, and then\n\n228\n00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:52.410\nit has to start again before it actually\ncan continue along the path, as well.\n\n229\n00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:57.910\nSo you will see it, but not as often as\nthe precedence diagram method instead.\n\n230\n00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:58.430\n>> Well, Ronnie,\n\n231\n00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:03.060\nyou've taken us through two pretty\nuseful looking diagrams that we can use.\n\n232\n00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.660\nBut I noticed that you had a few\nmore that maybe we'll run into.\n\n233\n00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.290\nMaybe they're useful for\na specific instances.\n\n234\n00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:11.340\nWhat are they, and how can we use them?\n\n235\n00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.720\n>> All right.\n\n236\n00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.970\nSo there's at least one more and\n\n237\n00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:20.250\nthis is actually used in conjunction with\nanother tool and a method that we have.\n\n238\n00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:24.588\nThere is what we call the Conditional\nDiagramming Method that we have available\n\n239\n00:14:24.588 --> 00:14:28.482\nto us and this one does look like\nthe precedent's diagramming method.\n\n240\n00:14:28.482 --> 00:14:31.365\nBut notice right here that on task D,\n\n241\n00:14:31.365 --> 00:14:36.090\nI have two conditions that\nare actually set up for us.\n\n242\n00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.168\nSo this does follow in the saying\nthat we had before but\n\n243\n00:14:39.168 --> 00:14:44.530\nat task D, let's say that here we have\na process that it has to go through.\n\n244\n00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:49.249\nAt the end of that we have some type\nof quality insurance that says,\n\n245\n00:14:49.249 --> 00:14:53.820\nhere is the level of insurance for\nthis product that we produce.\n\n246\n00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:58.380\nAnd it has the ability to have a pass,\nor has the ability to have a fail.\n\n247\n00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:02.660\nIf it meets that failure,\nnotice it loops back around to C and\n\n248\n00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.060\nbegins that particular work package again.\n\n249\n00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:09.950\nIt runs back through and this time,\nif it does meet that quality inspection or\n\n250\n00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:13.640\nwhatever it is and passes,\nthen it can proceed on.\n\n251\n00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.340\nAnd that is why we call it a Conditional\nDiagramming Method, because it meets\n\n252\n00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:23.030\na condition here, or we also do what we\ncall conditional loops because of that.\n\n253\n00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:28.016\nNow when you do end up with having what we\ncall different loops inside of our project\n\n254\n00:15:28.016 --> 00:15:32.784\nschedule, you normally have to actually\nnow start going into that particular\n\n255\n00:15:32.784 --> 00:15:35.616\narea of evaluating\nthe duration of that task.\n\n256\n00:15:35.616 --> 00:15:40.393\nBecause it is very possible that\nthere is a manufacturing defect\n\n257\n00:15:40.393 --> 00:15:44.645\nright here in the process D\nthat you didn't account for.\n\n258\n00:15:44.645 --> 00:15:48.911\nBut how do you account for\nthat lost time if it goes back to fail and\n\n259\n00:15:48.911 --> 00:15:50.971\nit has to start again, right?\n\n260\n00:15:50.971 --> 00:15:54.031\nBecause we're trying to plan\nout the entire schedule well,\n\n261\n00:15:54.031 --> 00:15:57.994\nthis is one of those processes that we\nactually have to take into that account.\n\n262\n00:15:57.994 --> 00:16:00.426\nThat something could fail, and if it does,\n\n263\n00:16:00.426 --> 00:16:05.110\nwhat does it delay our entire schedule\nin as far as those failed products?\n\n264\n00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:09.950\nSo this is where you might also end up\nusing a mathematical technique that,\n\n265\n00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.960\nof course, we call GERT,\nof all the things in the world.\n\n266\n00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:18.520\nSo if I come back here, GERT actually\nstands for Graphical Evaluation and\n\n267\n00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.710\nReview Technique.\n\n268\n00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:21.590\nNow, that might sound familiar like, man,\n\n269\n00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.320\nyou also mentioned PERT\nin another episode.\n\n270\n00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.020\nWe're talking about Program Evaluation and\nReview Technique as well.\n\n271\n00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:33.100\nAnd these are, again, based on different\nways that we do expected values,\n\n272\n00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:38.090\nwhich is what PERT does for us,\nand the Graphical Evaluation and\n\n273\n00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:42.930\nReview Technique is another\nmathematical process that we take into\n\n274\n00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:48.250\naccount if we do have loops that\naffect our entire project schedule.\n\n275\n00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:52.680\nLoops are a little bit unusual,\nbecause we do set those conditions up for\n\n276\n00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:57.420\nthe loops to happen, but how do we then\nknow when a project will ever finish?\n\n277\n00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:01.540\nWhat if I have 15, or let's say\n1,600 things that I'm making, and\n\n278\n00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.990\nthey don't meet that quality assurance?\n\n279\n00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.850\nWell, how do I account for\nthat in my project and still say,\n\n280\n00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:09.820\nat the end of it though, we'll still\nhave certain products that will be good,\n\n281\n00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.040\nbut all these other ones we'll be bad.\n\n282\n00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.520\nWell, how do we account for that?\n\n283\n00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.070\nThe extra step within that process here\n\n284\n00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:19.380\nthat says it's gonna go through this\nevaluation technique, what you do so\n\n285\n00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.450\nby using that mathematical\nevaluation inside of GERT.\n\n286\n00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:27.340\nNow, I'm just telling you that, because\nwe're not actually gonna go through that\n\n287\n00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:31.990\nprocess, because it's very rarely\nused on projects anymore, and\n\n288\n00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:34.880\nthe reason why is that we\nhave computer-aided models\n\n289\n00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.330\nthat really do help us instead of us\nhaving to manually figure it out.\n\n290\n00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.440\nBut you do have to actually realize\nthat it is there for you, so\n\n291\n00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.040\nit's normally gonna be used with\nthe CDM If you're gonna see it anywhere.\n\n292\n00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.830\nThat will help you to actually\nfigure out that duration estimate.\n\n293\n00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.840\n>> And now, Ronnie, when we talked\nabout PERT in the other episode,\n\n294\n00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:57.510\nyou mentioned that this was for extremely\nlong-cycled projects that we have 10,\n\n295\n00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.110\n20 years of a project.\n\n296\n00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:02.380\nIs GERT the same way, or can we use\nthat in just about any project we want?\n\n297\n00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.450\n>> You can use it in just about\nany project that you want.\n\n298\n00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:08.900\nBut normally, where you tend to see it\nused more often is when you do have\n\n299\n00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.790\nsomething that's insanely repeatable\nover and over again that's gonna happen.\n\n300\n00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:15.510\nSo a scenario that you might\nsee in use with Gert and\n\n301\n00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.870\nwith the conditional method, or\n\n302\n00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.390\nthe conditional diagramming method, might\nbe something along the lines of this.\n\n303\n00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.800\nLet's say that you're building a four or\nfive storey building, okay?\n\n304\n00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.440\nYou want to have network jacks\non every single floor for\n\n305\n00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.705\nhowever many you actually want in\nevery room, whatever it might be.\n\n306\n00:18:30.705 --> 00:18:34.390\nWell, the very fact is you have\na couple of different options.\n\n307\n00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:37.740\nYou can complete the entire\nstructure in the building\n\n308\n00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.260\nthat's actually going up in place,\nthen hire somebody to come in and\n\n309\n00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.730\nrun the wiring at the same time on\nevery floor, and then you're done.\n\n310\n00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.810\nIn other words,\nyou can say building is complete,\n\n311\n00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.760\nthen we're gonna complete\na wiring project.\n\n312\n00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:52.090\nIt's actually two different projects\nthat they can get merged into one.\n\n313\n00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:53.910\nBut the other thing that\nyou can do instead is say,\n\n314\n00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:55.780\nlook, here's what we're gonna do.\n\n315\n00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:00.870\nAt 85 percent completion of the first\nfloor, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n316\n00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:05.070\nstart wiring the first floor, and\nyou set that up as a mini sub-project\n\n317\n00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:08.420\ninside of that, and\nthen you say the same thing.\n\n318\n00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.090\nSecond floor, 85% complete.\n\n319\n00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:13.850\nWe're gonna actually start wiring\nall those network jacks there.\n\n320\n00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:16.020\nSame thing third floor,\nsame thing fourth floor.\n\n321\n00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.500\nYou can continue to do that so\nthat, essentially,\n\n322\n00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:22.390\nwhat you might think is that when the\nfirst floor is done as far as everything\n\n323\n00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.600\nelse, then the networking,\nat least the infrastructure.\n\n324\n00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.300\nThe wiring will also be done.\n\n325\n00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.130\nAnd then as the second floor goes up,\nthird floor, you might go,\n\n326\n00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:31.250\nwell, that's kind of silly.\n\n327\n00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.330\nWouldn't I just go ahead and\ncomplete everything at one time?\n\n328\n00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:34.690\nYeah, you can do that.\n\n329\n00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:38.080\nBut remember, what we're essentially\nsaying is, this is something that's\n\n330\n00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.700\nactually repeatable on each\nfloor that you may choose to do.\n\n331\n00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.180\nYou don't have to do it for that.\n\n332\n00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.250\nYou can do it for\nfire alarms if you want to.\n\n333\n00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:47.040\nYou can do it for installing doors.\n\n334\n00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.410\nEvery floor has to have doors, but\nwhen do you actually install them?\n\n335\n00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.440\nDo you install them all at one time,\nor do you install them in completion?\n\n336\n00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.630\nIf you're gonna actually do this in\nthe loop to spread out the work,\n\n337\n00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.010\nyou might also end up using GERT.\n\n338\n00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:00.010\nThat way, you can go ahead and estimate.\n\n339\n00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:04.620\nIt really did take the last 15% of my\nproject as I started doing every floor to\n\n340\n00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:09.460\nget done, so I know exactly how long\nit's gonna take to do the first floor.\n\n341\n00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.992\nIt should take the same thing for\nthe second floor as well, and\n\n342\n00:20:11.992 --> 00:20:15.307\nyou're essentially looping through that\nprocess every time your project comes\n\n343\n00:20:15.307 --> 00:20:17.694\nthrough the first floor,\nsecond floor, or third floor,\n\n344\n00:20:17.694 --> 00:20:20.320\nyou're actually completing\nthe same work as well.\n\n345\n00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:24.540\nSo that's when you'll generally see\nthat idea of something like GERT,\n\n346\n00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.480\nespecially if you're using it\nin a condition you're saying,\n\n347\n00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.500\nif it's not at 85%,\nwe don't start actually installing that.\n\n348\n00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.250\nIf it is, then we go ahead and start,\nand we allow the project to run through.\n\n349\n00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:39.600\nSo that way, you account for the duration\nof that idea of the extra work that has to\n\n350\n00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.540\nbe done on every single floor, and you're\nnot just accounting for it one time.\n\n351\n00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.640\n>> Now, that's great.\n\n352\n00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.380\nNow, we know that we can use GERT\nwhen we have a perceived window.\n\n353\n00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.100\nThere's going to be a repeatable\nloop type of activity.\n\n354\n00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.080\nOr if something comes up,\nand all of a sudden,\n\n355\n00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:57.270\nwe've hit that kinda pass or fail thing\nwhere we were gonna install these washers,\n\n356\n00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.890\nbut they're all the wrong washers.\n\n357\n00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:03.600\nAnd now, we have to repeat a cycle of\nactivity, we can use GERT to help us\n\n358\n00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.770\nestimate and see the flow chart of that,\nhow that is gonna work itself out.\n\n359\n00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:07.940\nVery handy item to have.\n\n360\n00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:13.600\n>> It really is, because it's easy\nwhen you're a novice project manager.\n\n361\n00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.960\nI know I was one at some point.\n\n362\n00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:21.040\nBut when you go ahead and go,\nI know exactly what has to be done, and\n\n363\n00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.350\nyou think about everything but\nthose repeatable conditions, right?\n\n364\n00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.920\nSo you can go ahead and set up, let's say,\n\n365\n00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.870\nin your project management information\nsystem, that this is what has to be done.\n\n366\n00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.350\nWell, how do you show that\nactually happening for\n\n367\n00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:36.990\nevery completion of the product\nthat you're doing again?\n\n368\n00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:38.750\nBut you may show the process one time, and\n\n369\n00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.610\nnow you're actually saying,\nI got to remember.\n\n370\n00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:43.200\nI gotta repeat that process over for\nthe next building,\n\n371\n00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.180\nI gotta repeat that process over for\nthe second and third floor.\n\n372\n00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:50.860\nWell, this is why GERT and things like\nthe conditional method really do help.\n\n373\n00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.700\nAnd inside your project management\ninformation systems, this is where your\n\n374\n00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:58.640\ndiagramming begins to get messy,\nbecause now you're actually looping from\n\n375\n00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.160\none activity and then you're saying\nhere's when the third one would begin.\n\n376\n00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.550\nAnd you're not actually just taking that.\n\n377\n00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:06.560\nYou're actually now linking that\naround to the third activity, and\n\n378\n00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.830\nthen fourth activity begins,\nand now you're actually saying,\n\n379\n00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:13.070\nthis one also is linked around there,\nand you'll end up seeing a very big,\n\n380\n00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:16.770\ngigantic mess of this\nprecedence diagram method or\n\n381\n00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:20.710\narrow ones that actually just show\na bunch of links all in them.\n\n382\n00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:24.370\nAnd you have to keep that straight, and\nthat's where a GERT helps you out to keep\n\n383\n00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:28.420\nthat straight as far as the duration go,\nbut the diagramming methods also help you.\n\n384\n00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.690\nAs long as you can actually follow them,\nthat's the key.\n\n385\n00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:31.450\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n386\n00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:35.460\nWell, Ronnie, are there any other types of\ndiagramming methods that we might have at\n\n387\n00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.740\nour disposal for a given scenario?\n\n388\n00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.140\n>> We do have to talk about one more.\n\n389\n00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:44.700\nSo let's go back to my diagram here for\na moment as we take a look.\n\n390\n00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:49.530\nNow, in this episode, we really did\nfocus in on really these diagramming\n\n391\n00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:53.640\nmethods that allow us to visually see\nthe logical connections in between them.\n\n392\n00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.700\nWe also talked about GERT here,\nspecifically, but there's something else\n\n393\n00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:01.930\nwe also need to do when we start talking\nabout creating the project schedule and\n\n394\n00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:05.700\nunderstanding that project schedule\nas well, and this is something that's\n\n395\n00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.950\nactually very important for us if\nwe're going to choose the right tool,\n\n396\n00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:13.740\nif we're actually going to make sure that\nwe understand what has to be done here.\n\n397\n00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:17.720\nNow, we've actually shown a couple\nof examples in other episodes here\n\n398\n00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.240\non the critical path method.\n\n399\n00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:23.460\nAnd I know, Daniel, you enjoyed every\nmoment of that as I did math poorly.\n\n400\n00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.190\nAll throughout those episodes here.\n\n401\n00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.940\n>> It was riveting.\n\n402\n00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.600\n>> It was riveting, yeah.\n\n403\n00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.910\nSo those things can be that way, and\n\n404\n00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.880\nthat's just do the simple\nmathematical errors.\n\n405\n00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:35.920\nAnd when you're actually looking at, it\ndoes get a little bit fuzzy after a while.\n\n406\n00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.347\nSo you're gonna keep your\nlogic straight there,\n\n407\n00:23:38.347 --> 00:23:41.661\nbut there's something that\nthe critical path method doesn't do.\n\n408\n00:23:41.661 --> 00:23:45.813\nSo in other words, the critical path,\nhow should you determine that longest path\n\n409\n00:23:45.813 --> 00:23:49.744\nduration through your entire project\nwithout any interruptions and flaws?\n\n410\n00:23:49.744 --> 00:23:52.988\nBut there's an assumption\nthat goes on there, Daniel,\n\n411\n00:23:52.988 --> 00:23:56.715\nthat is really a danger assumption For\nthat longest path, okay?\n\n412\n00:23:56.715 --> 00:24:00.936\nAnd that is that what you're assuming\nis that all of those activities\n\n413\n00:24:00.936 --> 00:24:05.447\non that critical path, you're never\ngonna have a shortage of people, or\n\n414\n00:24:05.447 --> 00:24:07.860\nresources, or anything else.\n\n415\n00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.616\nYou're just at this point,\nright, in planning,\n\n416\n00:24:10.616 --> 00:24:14.110\nyou're saying best of all possible worlds,\nright?\n\n417\n00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.860\nI don't have anybody working\novertime on anything.\n\n418\n00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.430\nI don't have anybody only giving\nme part time on something.\n\n419\n00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:24.270\nI have all my resources available\nthat this is what should lay out.\n\n420\n00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:25.520\n>> It's all best case scenario.\n\n421\n00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.930\n>> Best case scenario,\nand that's problematic.\n\n422\n00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:29.930\nWhy?\nBecause on projects,\n\n423\n00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:31.590\nyou're working with people.\n\n424\n00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:34.010\nYou're working against time, weather.\n\n425\n00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:37.390\n[LAUGH] At times, weather is a big one.\n\n426\n00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:38.280\n>> Unforeseeable delays.\n\n427\n00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:42.750\n>> Unforeseeable delays as far as\nproduct delivery goes, you name it.\n\n428\n00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.100\nNo matter what, in reality,\n\n429\n00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:50.420\nthe idea of the critical path does help\nyou to see the broad stroke, okay.\n\n430\n00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:54.740\nThe path that it should take if there's no\ninterruptions, that we should finish on\n\n431\n00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:59.090\ntime, but the problem is it really\ndoesn't account for reality, okay.\n\n432\n00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:04.270\nThat is insanely problematic for\nany project manager.\n\n433\n00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:08.120\nSo what instead do you use if you're\nreally gonna start trying to create\n\n434\n00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.028\na project plan?\n\n435\n00:25:09.028 --> 00:25:12.910\nWell, the one that most people focus\nin on, and let me go ahead and\n\n436\n00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:18.680\ncircle it down here for a moment, is what\nwe call the critical chain method instead.\n\n437\n00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:24.032\nThe critical chain method instead says\nlook, let's take into reality this,\n\n438\n00:25:24.032 --> 00:25:27.357\nthat resources can actually\nbe overutilized and\n\n439\n00:25:27.357 --> 00:25:31.320\ncause an extension of the overall project,\nokay?\n\n440\n00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.380\nSo that's what will end up happening.\n\n441\n00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:37.950\nSo what is best even now as you're\nactually writing out the project schedule\n\n442\n00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:40.130\nis to go ahead and account for that.\n\n443\n00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:43.660\nSo the way that they do it is they take\nthat perfect path, the best of all\n\n444\n00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:48.070\npossible worlds, the critical path,\nand then they start to go, all right.\n\n445\n00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:51.535\nSo what is the reality of the amount\nof work that we are doing,\n\n446\n00:25:51.535 --> 00:25:54.310\nokay, and that's kind of key.\n\n447\n00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:58.010\nNow the way that it works out is not\nin the same way as the critical path,\n\n448\n00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.420\nbut a little bit more.\n\n449\n00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.030\nLet me kind of show you an example here,\n\n450\n00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.350\nis what we're going to\ntake a look at here.\n\n451\n00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:06.255\nAll right, so let me show you\nwhat I'm talking about here.\n\n452\n00:26:06.255 --> 00:26:09.680\nOkay, so when we take a look\nat the critical chain method,\n\n453\n00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.440\nremember that what we're taking a look at,\nright, are each of the activities and\n\n454\n00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:18.920\ntheir durations here in that critical\npath method, okay, in the beginning.\n\n455\n00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.432\nOkay, what we don't take into account\nof is the amount of work that can be\n\n456\n00:26:22.432 --> 00:26:25.640\naccomplished and\nwho's gonna be assigned to them.\n\n457\n00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.680\nSo here, what we do is we focus in then\n\n458\n00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:33.740\nwith the critical chain on\nresolving resource constraints.\n\n459\n00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:37.540\nNow in this example,\nboth of these charts down here, and\n\n460\n00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.700\nwe're going to focus in on\nthe top one up here, okay.\n\n461\n00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:44.220\nThey represent the activities\nthat one resource, let's say,\n\n462\n00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.770\nis going to be assigned to, okay.\n\n463\n00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.759\nNow when you take a look at this,\n\n464\n00:26:47.759 --> 00:26:51.280\nright, here's a regular work\nweek that we end up seeing here.\n\n465\n00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:56.460\nAnd we can see that for the first three\ndays of this particular resource and\n\n466\n00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:00.160\nwhat he's doing, he's on a lot of\ndifferent activities, okay, and\n\n467\n00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.240\nthat makes sense, okay?\n\n468\n00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:07.380\nBut in all these activities going all\nthe way through activity F that we see,\n\n469\n00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:11.350\nnotice this red line that I have drawn\nhere and right here at this mark, and\n\n470\n00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:14.870\nI've made this representation\nof eight hours in a day.\n\n471\n00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:19.810\nNormally a regular project schedule works\naround that idea that a work day, right,\n\n472\n00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:21.260\nis about eight hours a day.\n\n473\n00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.100\nAnd that's my assumption at this point,\nokay?\n\n474\n00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:28.610\nBut notice here, activity A,\non Monday, it takes about eight hours.\n\n475\n00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:33.530\nBut notice on Tuesday though, it seemed\nlike that all these activities that this\n\n476\n00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:37.690\nresource is involved in, and we can call\nit Daniel if we want to, is involved in,\n\n477\n00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:42.360\nDaniel, you're gonna be working\nten hours on Tuesday, okay?\n\n478\n00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.310\nAnd then, once you're done with\nthat ten hour day on Tuesday,\n\n479\n00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:48.440\nyou're gonna come back Wednesday,\nand you're gonna work\n\n480\n00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:52.570\nabout 12 hours on Wednesday, instead,\nor somewhere around there, okay?\n\n481\n00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:53.130\n>> Overtime.\n\n482\n00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:55.230\n>> Overtime, yeah, that sounds awesome,\n\n483\n00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:58.300\nexcept when you're actually having to\ndo this week after week after week.\n\n484\n00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.280\nAnd when we're planning this out,\n\n485\n00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:04.090\nright, with that critical path,\nwe don't consider that.\n\n486\n00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:08.260\nWe don't consider overtime, we just say,\nideally, this is what would happen, and\n\n487\n00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:11.715\nthen now we assign Daniel to it and\nsay, yeah, this all can be done.\n\n488\n00:28:11.715 --> 00:28:16.290\nOkay, it all can be done at this point,\nand we do that.\n\n489\n00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:19.870\nBut the critical chain method here\nremember, actually says, wait a minute,\n\n490\n00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.620\nthere are constraints on every resource.\n\n491\n00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:25.210\nAnd that constraint as\nfar as my project goes,\n\n492\n00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:27.970\nit says that we work on\nan eight hour work day.\n\n493\n00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:31.210\nWell notice that there's at\nleast two activities here\n\n494\n00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.040\nthat Daniel's actually been assigned.\n\n495\n00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:38.250\nAnd even though Daniel calls it overtime,\nyou and I would tend to call it overtime,\n\n496\n00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:42.930\nin project management lingo,\nwe call it over allocation.\n\n497\n00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:43.890\n>> Hm, it does sound fancy.\n\n498\n00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:44.900\n>> Yeah it does sound fancy.\n\n499\n00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:45.752\nIt's overtime, okay?\n\n500\n00:28:45.752 --> 00:28:47.597\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's what it comes down to.\n\n501\n00:28:47.597 --> 00:28:48.670\nIt is overtime, okay?\n\n502\n00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:49.768\n>> We call it a fatter check.\n\n503\n00:28:49.768 --> 00:28:52.740\n[LAUGH]\n>> It can be a fatter check, but\n\n504\n00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.400\noverall though, it is overtime.\n\n505\n00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:00.400\nAnd let's say that we have this restraint\nthat says, Daniel, no overtime.\n\n506\n00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.922\nDaniel's face just went\ninto a big old frown and so\n\n507\n00:29:02.922 --> 00:29:06.300\n[LAUGH] when that happens, man,\nbut we have to keep that in mind.\n\n508\n00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.410\nIf I'm the project manager and\nsays, look, very little or\n\n509\n00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.860\nthe overtime could only be\ndone in the contingency.\n\n510\n00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.150\nThat's fine but here it is,\n\n511\n00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:17.030\nI'm in the planning stages and\nI've got Daniel working overtime, okay.\n\n512\n00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:19.960\nPerfect world scenario,\nit would all be done, okay.\n\n513\n00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:25.390\nSo what we do is that we now actually go\nall right, so what can be done here, okay?\n\n514\n00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:29.680\nWith using the critical chain method\ninstead, there are several techniques.\n\n515\n00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.320\nWe're not gonna get super\ninvolved in a ton of techniques.\n\n516\n00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.176\nBut one of them that's actually\nreally popular in well,\n\n517\n00:29:35.176 --> 00:29:38.810\njust about everything is what we\ncall resource levelling, okay?\n\n518\n00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.640\nSo, this is where we come\ndown to the bottom instead.\n\n519\n00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:45.580\nThe critical chain here says look, what\nwe have to do is we need to focus in on\n\n520\n00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.850\nhow do we reserve that constraint\nhere that everybody only really\n\n521\n00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:52.300\nworks an eight hour day, and Daniel is\nonly going to work an eight hour day.\n\n522\n00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.780\nWell, what we do is we divide the work up.\n\n523\n00:29:54.780 --> 00:30:00.220\nSo on Tuesday, when he's been over\nallocated, I look for the next available\n\n524\n00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:05.780\ntime in which Daniel is not over\nallocated, and I split that task.\n\n525\n00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:10.000\nSo notice that this is task D, and this\ntiny one right here is also task D, but\n\n526\n00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.020\nmuch smaller.\n\n527\n00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:15.510\nBut now notice that on Tuesday and\nWednesday though, he's not over allocated.\n\n528\n00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:17.850\nHe's working his eight hour day.\n\n529\n00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:21.320\nNow what about on Wednesday,\nwhen we had task F up here?\n\n530\n00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.527\nWell instead, what we do is we\nmove that now to Thursday, okay.\n\n531\n00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:30.170\nNow when we do something like this, notice\nthat now Daniel's not over allocated,\n\n532\n00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:32.040\nhe's not getting overtime.\n\n533\n00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.710\nBut, we're actually now levelling his\nresources to the constraint that we\n\n534\n00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:36.960\nneed them to be.\n\n535\n00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.770\nBut look at what happened to\nthe schedule though, okay?\n\n536\n00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:44.880\nWhereas Daniel had it for the first\nthree days, where that's exactly,\n\n537\n00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.370\nlet's say that this represents a miniature\nportion of a sub-project here,\n\n538\n00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:49.760\nall the way through task F.\n\n539\n00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.190\nHe should have finished on Wednesday.\n\n540\n00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:55.010\nDaniel, it looks like you're going\nto have to work on Thursday instead.\n\n541\n00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:57.340\n>> Well, as long as I'm already\nscheduled to work on Thursday, and\n\n542\n00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.050\nit's a nice even eight hour day,\nI'm pretty happy about that.\n\n543\n00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:02.351\n>> Yeah, and so a lot of times,\nit may be that way.\n\n544\n00:31:02.351 --> 00:31:05.780\nAnd so that's what you'll also end\nup seeing is that the critical path\n\n545\n00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:09.820\ntries to take that into account and\nthen says look, along with that,\n\n546\n00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.410\nit's gonna push the schedule\nout a little bit.\n\n547\n00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:16.210\nAnd that's the reality of\nactually planning this stuff out.\n\n548\n00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:18.720\nWhen you take the critical path method and\n\n549\n00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.470\nwe're just focusing on this one second,\nokay?\n\n550\n00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:25.350\nIt's your project schedule, right,\nthat's what you're actually relying on.\n\n551\n00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:28.300\nBut that is like you taking a sponge,\nright, and\n\n552\n00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:32.720\nyou're wringing out every single\nbit of water that you can.\n\n553\n00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.550\nAnd once you do that, right,\nit can soak up more, okay.\n\n554\n00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:39.760\nAnd that's the key, right, is your\ncritical path method is doing that.\n\n555\n00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.830\nIt's saying, look,\nno extra slack anywhere,\n\n556\n00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:46.910\nno free time or float,\nno float in between any activity.\n\n557\n00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.256\nYou're squeezing that schedule out, okay.\n\n558\n00:31:49.256 --> 00:31:51.879\nNow you're not taking into\naccount anything, but\n\n559\n00:31:51.879 --> 00:31:55.539\nnow when I start adding in Daniel as\na a resource, myself as a resource,\n\n560\n00:31:55.539 --> 00:31:57.866\nother people as a resource,\nwhat am I doing?\n\n561\n00:31:57.866 --> 00:32:01.254\nI'm now soaking that sponge up\na little bit more with the water,\n\n562\n00:32:01.254 --> 00:32:03.763\nwhatever it is that I'm\nsoaking up with it, and\n\n563\n00:32:03.763 --> 00:32:07.340\nwhat's happening is that that\nschedule is now expanding.\n\n564\n00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:11.050\nBecause now Daniel says,\nI can't really do it on Thursday,\n\n565\n00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:12.930\nI've got a chiropractor appointment.\n\n566\n00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:14.370\nCan I push that to Friday?\n\n567\n00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:15.320\nWell, that's a reality.\n\n568\n00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.010\nIt happens, right?\n\n569\n00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:21.230\nAnd these are things that the critical\nchain takes into account.\n\n570\n00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:23.510\nAnd that's why when reality comes in,\n\n571\n00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:28.055\ncritical path is good when you actually go\nall right, I'm a little bit delayed now.\n\n572\n00:32:28.055 --> 00:32:33.010\nWhat else is actually gonna\nbe delayed if I do this?\n\n573\n00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:35.470\nWell, then you actually soak that back in,\nokay?\n\n574\n00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:39.683\nBut now, this is us taking reality into\naccount here, and when we do so, resource\n\n575\n00:32:39.683 --> 00:32:44.080\nconstraints and the critical path, again,\nshow us that what will end up happening is\n\n576\n00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:48.264\nthe majority of time, right, it will\nexpand our schedule out a little bit more.\n\n577\n00:32:48.264 --> 00:32:51.608\nAnd this is a more realistic\nview of our scheduling, and\n\n578\n00:32:51.608 --> 00:32:55.960\nthat's why it's actually very critical for\nus to at least understand.\n\n579\n00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.850\nNow, did we go through every method of it?\n\n580\n00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:01.040\nNo, okay, but\nthis is kind of a big general overview.\n\n581\n00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.760\nSo when you see something like that and\nthey talk about something like this\n\n582\n00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.360\nthat when you're dealing\nwith over-allocation, one\n\n583\n00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:11.322\nof the methods that you can use is what we\ncall the idea here of resource levelling.\n\n584\n00:33:11.322 --> 00:33:14.390\nResource levelling, I don't know why\nthat doesn't sound right in my mind,\n\n585\n00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:15.230\nbut it is right.\n\n586\n00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:18.890\nResource levelling, okay, or\nyou can actually go ahead and just go,\n\n587\n00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:20.950\nall right, Daniel, you're just\ngonna be assigned the overtime.\n\n588\n00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:25.180\nAnd that's fine with Daniel maybe,\nand that may be fine with me.\n\n589\n00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.860\nBut you might find out that\nyou can't do that, and\n\n590\n00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.280\nthat means you have to use\nsomething like the critical\n\n591\n00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.890\nchain to see what now happens to\nthe rest of your schedule as well.\n\n592\n00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:33.600\nSo a lot of different methods there.\n\n593\n00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:39.180\n>> Yeah, I can definitely see why\nthe chain method would be very,\n\n594\n00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:43.540\nvery highly recommended because it does\ngive you that more realistic approach to\n\n595\n00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:44.460\nthe time allocation.\n\n596\n00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:48.510\nHow long is this really gonna take,\ninstead of giving you some pie in the sky.\n\n597\n00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:51.543\nEverything goes perfectly right,\nwe can get it done in three weeks,\n\n598\n00:33:51.543 --> 00:33:53.437\nwhen it's really going to take six weeks.\n\n599\n00:33:53.437 --> 00:33:56.530\nAnd then what happens is just\nlike what I talked about before.\n\n600\n00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:59.370\nYou say it’s going to take three weeks and\nthen now three weeks have come and\n\n601\n00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:02.500\ngone, things have occurred,\ndelays of it has happened.\n\n602\n00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.420\nAnd now you’re pushing it and\npeople think, wow,\n\n603\n00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:06.160\nyou told me it was going\nto take three weeks.\n\n604\n00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.046\nYou have unsatisfied stakeholders in your\nprojects, and you’re going to have to\n\n605\n00:34:10.046 --> 00:34:13.330\nresell them on well,\nwe didn't account for da da da da da.\n\n606\n00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:14.515\nAnd now you look a little,\n\n607\n00:34:14.515 --> 00:34:18.090\nyou're probably not the best project\nmanager ever to walk the Earth.\n\n608\n00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:21.860\nBut Ronnie, really great resources\nthat you've shown us today and\n\n609\n00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.450\nhow we can figure out how\nthe project is gonna flow and\n\n610\n00:34:25.450 --> 00:34:30.540\nthen that way we can actually create\na schedule that is going to be realistic.\n\n611\n00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.860\nCuz these diagram methods are really\ngonna come in handy for our projects.\n\n612\n00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.310\nAnything else that we need to\ntalk about before we wrap it up?\n\n613\n00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:40.190\n>> No, really remember that a lot of\nus are gonna learn this in the field,\n\n614\n00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:41.150\nis what it comes down to.\n\n615\n00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.960\nWe've shown you several examples\nthat will at least get you\n\n616\n00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.610\nfamiliar with the concepts.\n\n617\n00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:47.990\nJust don't be surprised\nif you see any of them.\n\n618\n00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:51.800\nIt really does depend on the experience\nof whatever project manager you end up\n\n619\n00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.891\nworking under.\n\n620\n00:34:52.891 --> 00:34:55.416\nAnd they'll actually show you the ways\nthat they've also tweaked it.\n\n621\n00:34:55.416 --> 00:34:58.221\nRemember everything about\nproject management, right,\n\n622\n00:34:58.221 --> 00:35:01.330\nis not about doing it by the rules,\nit's about best practices.\n\n623\n00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:04.885\nAnd that means that hey,\nnot everything is gonna be as cut and\n\n624\n00:35:04.885 --> 00:35:06.715\ndry as the way that you want to.\n\n625\n00:35:06.715 --> 00:35:09.225\nIt's always gonna be, well,\nhere's how I do it best.\n\n626\n00:35:09.225 --> 00:35:12.500\nAnd you'll probably find that out\nthat as you manage a project,\n\n627\n00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.230\nyou'll kind of cut your corners\nthe way that you want to.\n\n628\n00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:16.770\nAnd everybody else will just fall in line.\n\n629\n00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:18.890\nAnd it's kind of a neat thing\nabout project management.\n\n630\n00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:20.750\nit is not rule based.\n\n631\n00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.210\nIt's best practice based.\n\n632\n00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:24.150\nAnd that means you do the best\nthat you can at times.\n\n633\n00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.680\n>> That's right.\n\n634\n00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:29.230\nAnd we try to be as practical as possible\nin our project management and scheduling.\n\n635\n00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:32.490\nRonnie, thank you so much for joining us\ntoday and explaining these concepts to us.\n\n636\n00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:36.470\nHopefully you guys get a lot out of that\nbut as for this episode goes, we are done.\n\n637\n00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:38.060\nIt is time to say sayonara.\n\n638\n00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.526\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n639\n00:35:40.526 --> 00:35:41.448\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n640\n00:35:41.448 --> 00:35:42.891\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n641\n00:35:42.891 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.820\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowry, and today's\nepisode, well we are moving on with our\n\n4\n00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.510\nProject + series, joining us back in the\nstudio again today is our good friend and\n\n5\n00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.600\nmentor Mr. Ronald Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.970\nRonnie welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n7\n00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.190\n>> Well thank you for having me back\non the show as we continue on to take\n\n8\n00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.350\na look at more of the CompTIA Project +.\n\n9\n00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.530\nAnd what we're actually doing\ntoday is we're gonna talk about\n\n10\n00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.430\nmanaging communications.\n\n11\n00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.750\nWe're talking about the idea of\nplanning out our communications and\n\n12\n00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.190\nwe need to understand that communications\nis by far one of the things that is very\n\n13\n00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.960\neasy to get wrong.\n\n14\n00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.240\nWhen we talk about communications, a lot\nof times from the standpoint of a leader,\n\n15\n00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.690\nwhat you end up understanding\nis that leaders get information.\n\n16\n00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.460\nThey don't tend to have to actually\nexpress themselves too much on their own.\n\n17\n00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.690\nBecause what they say then is interpreted\nby someone else, like a spokesperson.\n\n18\n00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.490\nAnd then they actually\nend up bringing that out.\n\n19\n00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.540\nAnd now we actually get some type\nof official message that comes out.\n\n20\n00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.610\nWell, inside of project management,\nwe're not talking about\n\n21\n00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.740\nbasic communications even though\nwe could throw all that in there.\n\n22\n00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.740\nWe're talking about how we\nmanage communications and\n\n23\n00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.850\nthis is by far one of the most important\nelements for a project manager\n\n24\n00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.560\nto understand because Daniel, you and\nI, we run in to situations and\n\n25\n00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.870\nissues where you simply talk to\nsomeone and you have a conversation.\n\n26\n00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.820\nAnd what ends up happening is that\nyou hear back from someone else,\n\n27\n00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.650\nthat this is what you actually said.\n\n28\n00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.490\nAnd Daniel, that doesn't feel good right?\n\n29\n00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.180\n>> No and it can be frustrating.\n\n30\n00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.090\nIt can definitely break down the forward\nmomentum of any kind of project.\n\n31\n00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.530\nI've literally told somebody something and\nsaid.\n\n32\n00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.810\nWell we need to do x, y, and z.\n\n33\n00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.040\nAnd watch them walk across the room and\n\n34\n00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.210\nexplain it to somebody there and\ncompletely have missed the mark.\n\n35\n00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.830\nThey didn't understand what\nit was I was telling them and\n\n36\n00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.300\ntherefore as they communicated it to\nsomebody else, it started to break down.\n\n37\n00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.480\nIt's kind of the old phone game as a kid.\n\n38\n00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.840\nYou know, I whisper in Ronnie's ear and\nten other people later you get back and\n\n39\n00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.580\nit's something completely\ndifferent than what you said.\n\n40\n00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.970\nSo Ronnie, that being said,\n\n41\n00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.940\nthis is today you're gonna help us keep\nthat kind of thing from happening.\n\n42\n00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.970\nYou're gonna show us some ways to properly\ncommunicate with everybody on the project\n\n43\n00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.840\nso that everything is done\nthe way it's supposed to be done.\n\n44\n00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.480\n>> Right, we're talking about\nnow how do we manage it best.\n\n45\n00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.730\nSo let me kind of show you an example of\nwhy things can kind of get messed up in\n\n46\n00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.680\nthe way Daniel said it here.\n\n47\n00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.610\nSo here it is.\n\n48\n00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.540\nI made a diagram for us to understand what\nends up happening a lot of times here,\n\n49\n00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.900\nis let's say we have six people.\n\n50\n00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.210\nAnd these are represented by\nthese squares right here.\n\n51\n00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.440\nAnd it looks like I should probably\nhave zoomed in just a little.\n\n52\n00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.920\nSo let me zoom in just a little\nbit more and help us out.\n\n53\n00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.940\nThere we go.\n\n54\n00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.460\nSo we'll focus in on that model,\nthat diagram, and\n\n55\n00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.920\nthen we'll talk about how we\nhave these communications.\n\n56\n00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.230\nSo let's say that there are six people\nin this particular project, and\n\n57\n00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.320\none person actually does\nthe communication, right?\n\n58\n00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.930\nNow, if we're in a meeting of some sort\nit seems like it works perfectly fine and\n\n59\n00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.430\nwhat I believe that's actually happened is\nthat they've heard exactly what I said,\n\n60\n00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.120\nall six people, okay?\n\n61\n00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.700\nWell, that could be true, okay, that they\nactually heard the words that I said, but\n\n62\n00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.590\nthen after the meeting disperses, okay,\nafter it actually is over the other five,\n\n63\n00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.810\nthey go into the next room, and then they\nsay what did Ronnie really say about that?\n\n64\n00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.810\nNow you essentially have another\ncommunication form that actually goes on\n\n65\n00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.880\nbetween those other five, and\n\n66\n00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.170\nthen they start interpreting what\nmight have really been said.\n\n67\n00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.650\nEach one essentially saying and\nthinking and doing and\n\n68\n00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.790\nrepeating what they believe's\nactually going on here.\n\n69\n00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.510\nSo in this particular type of model,\n\n70\n00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.640\nthen, you essentially have what we call\na full mesh communication theory, okay?\n\n71\n00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.730\nAnd that means that even though one\nperson might have spread the message\n\n72\n00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.540\nIt doesn't necessarily mean that the other\nones didn't spread a message that then it\n\n73\n00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.390\nstarted denigrating and\ncontinuing down as well.\n\n74\n00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.300\nSo whenever you have more than one\nperson you're communicating to, you've\n\n75\n00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.970\ngot to actually figure out the idea of\na communication model which actually says,\n\n76\n00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.320\nlook, everybody can communicate\nwith everybody else.\n\n77\n00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.470\nAnd just like we as humans can actually\nhave misunderstandings between you.\n\n78\n00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.680\nLet's say that you actually have\na very Maine type of accent.\n\n79\n00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.370\nHere in the United States\nyou tend to drop the letter\n\n80\n00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.460\nR a lot of times if you're from Maine.\n\n81\n00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.310\nAnd then if you're like me,\nwhere you're from the south,\n\n82\n00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.710\nyou tend to over exaggerate and\nelongate your vowels a little bit.\n\n83\n00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.840\nAnd you might not understand\nexactly what we're talking about.\n\n84\n00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.080\nSo, it could be just\nbasic miscommunication.\n\n85\n00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.220\nOr somebody could actually just\nreinterpret what you have.\n\n86\n00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.330\nAnd the reason why that's\nimportant is because everybody can\n\n87\n00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.100\nactually communicate.\n\n88\n00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.760\nAnd so\n\n89\n00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.160\nwhat you end up having to do is figure out\nhow many possible variations are there?\n\n90\n00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.090\nHow many possible\ncommunications can be going on?\n\n91\n00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.800\nIn this model right here.\n\n92\n00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.960\nYou expand that out to your project and\nyou go,\n\n93\n00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.980\nwait I've got 30 people, you're right.\n\n94\n00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.850\nThat means everybody has a potential of\ncommunicating with everybody else and\n\n95\n00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.240\nstill getting the message wrong.\n\n96\n00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.170\nThat's what it breaks down to.\n\n97\n00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.830\nSo the way that we figure this out is,\nwe're given a group or a team you need to\n\n98\n00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.130\nfigure out what are the possibilities here\nand it comes out to a basic formula and\n\n99\n00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.310\nthat formula is right over\nhere on the left hand side,\n\n100\n00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.830\nI'm gonna highlight a little bit more\nis something like this, it's n and\n\n101\n00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.800\nthen you actually end up multiplying\nit by n minus 1 divided by 2, okay.\n\n102\n00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.220\nSo you're trying to establish\nevery communication\n\n103\n00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.230\npossibility between every other node so\nlet's say that my n is 6.\n\n104\n00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.130\nWhich is 6 people.\n\n105\n00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.830\nWhich is what I showed you over\nhere on the right hand side.\n\n106\n00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.240\nAnd now I go ahead and I convert that.\n\n107\n00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.990\nYou take 6 and\nthen you multiply it by 6 minus 1.\n\n108\n00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.250\nWhich essentially gives you 6 times 5.\n\n109\n00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.750\nAnd then you multiply that out and\nthat gives you 30 and\n\n110\n00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.490\nthen you divide the whole thing by two.\n\n111\n00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.760\nYou have possibly 15 separate ways that\n\n112\n00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.170\nthe message can really be\nheard by any one individual.\n\n113\n00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.770\nAnd that's pretty scary, right?\n\n114\n00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.820\nSo I could say something and\nit, in theory,\n\n115\n00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.330\ncan be interpreted in 15 different ways,\nokay?\n\n116\n00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.500\nNow, does that mean that people can't add?\n\n117\n00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.380\nThey can.\nThey can do all that.\n\n118\n00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.220\nSo what are we talking about,\nthen, in project management?\n\n119\n00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.560\nThe whole goal and theme behind\nplanning out communications, right,\n\n120\n00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.150\nis to ensure that we get the right\ninformation, okay, to the right people.\n\n121\n00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.930\nExactly at the right time, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.770\nAny time when that stuff doesn't happen\nin the order that I just talked about,\n\n123\n00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.760\nokay, it begins to come out wrong and all\nof a sudden now you're having to explain.\n\n124\n00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.450\nWell, they didn't tell you\nexactly what she said,\n\n125\n00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.390\nthey didn't tell you what I meant.\n\n126\n00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.570\nAnd that person shouldn't even have\ntheir nose in my project at all.\n\n127\n00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.490\nAnd we were going to reveal that,\nbut it didn't need to be revealed\n\n128\n00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.760\nright now because, well,\nthere's nothing we can do about it.\n\n129\n00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.620\nSo they were frightening you\nabout something that really\n\n130\n00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.640\nhasn't even come close\nto being a possibility.\n\n131\n00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.880\nSo the idea of managing or planning\nout communications is all about it,\n\n132\n00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.800\nand if you wanna make that\nyour overall gigantic theme,\n\n133\n00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.380\nwhen you talk about planning and\ncommunication, it's exactly that,\n\n134\n00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.120\ngetting the right information to\nthe right people at the right time.\n\n135\n00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.370\nAnd if you keep that in your head,\nwhen you do end up getting ready for\n\n136\n00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.240\nthe exam and stuff, and\nthey ask about communication plans\n\n137\n00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.820\nthink of any element that\nwe're gonna go over okay?\n\n138\n00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.910\nAnd go is that at the right people okay?\n\n139\n00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.390\nAt the right or the right information\nto the right people at the right time.\n\n140\n00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.190\nAnd that's pretty much gonna give you\nthe keys to the kingdom of understanding,\n\n141\n00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.440\nplanning communications\nas a Project Manager.\n\n142\n00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.368\nSo what do we actually have to have then?\n\n143\n00:07:53.368 --> 00:07:58.328\nWe take a look at building or\nplanning out our communications.\n\n144\n00:07:58.328 --> 00:08:01.538\nSo when we start to take a look at.\n\n145\n00:08:01.538 --> 00:08:06.123\nThere's a couple of things that we have to\nrealize, okay, is that we really do have\n\n146\n00:08:06.123 --> 00:08:10.511\nto communicate between not only people\nthat are on our project team, but also,\n\n147\n00:08:10.511 --> 00:08:12.300\nof course, our stakeholders.\n\n148\n00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.440\nAnd getting the information to the right\npeople at the right time is really gonna\n\n149\n00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.810\nhelp in getting that right information.\n\n150\n00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.370\nSo how do we do that?\n\n151\n00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.275\nWell, one of the first things that we do,\n\n152\n00:08:22.275 --> 00:08:27.660\nis we come up with what we call\na distribution list of some sort.\n\n153\n00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.060\nNow you don't have to call\nit a distribution list but\n\n154\n00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.620\nthese are kinda the CompTIA terms\nthat you end up seeing here.\n\n155\n00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.930\nYou create a distribution list and\nwhat are we doing right here?\n\n156\n00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:39.080\nWe're trying to actually make\nsure that we identify what?\n\n157\n00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.730\nThe right people.\n\n158\n00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.589\nWe know the information\nthat we need to relay, but\n\n159\n00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:47.485\nat this point we need to be able to\nidentify the people or the groups.\n\n160\n00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:52.904\nAnd this includes project team members as\nwell as stakeholders that actually do have\n\n161\n00:08:52.904 --> 00:08:59.140\na vested interest in our project, either\nfailing or actually succeeding as well.\n\n162\n00:08:59.140 --> 00:08:59.650\nAnd so\n\n163\n00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:04.810\nthis distribution list is not only kept to\nthose who are in support of the project.\n\n164\n00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.550\nSometimes you do need to reveal\ninformation to people that are against\n\n165\n00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.510\nyour project as well.\n\n166\n00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.023\nWhy?\nBecause you're trying to limit the damage\n\n167\n00:09:13.023 --> 00:09:15.675\nthat may come out of something\nadverse in your project.\n\n168\n00:09:15.675 --> 00:09:19.770\nAnd for somebody to actually,\nI don't want to say over-exaggerate.\n\n169\n00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.350\nThere is no way that people would\nover-exaggerate a problem, Daniel,\n\n170\n00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.200\never for your project especially\nif they want it to fail.\n\n171\n00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.660\nBut for them to have that chance right.\n\n172\n00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.320\nSo, you need to know who you're\ngoing to be communicating to, and\n\n173\n00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.070\nthat is absolutely a key\nidea here is to make sure\n\n174\n00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.420\nthat we can identify that\nparticular list here.\n\n175\n00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.388\nNow, you're probably pretty smart and\nyou're probably saying,\n\n176\n00:09:41.388 --> 00:09:43.180\nI know exactly who I would tell.\n\n177\n00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:49.780\nAnd that's where we become problematic\nbecause we forget all about this, okay.\n\n178\n00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.730\nWe forget that if we tell one person,\nokay, that they are also connected to how\n\n179\n00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.414\nmany people, and\nthen that message then turns into what?\n\n180\n00:09:58.414 --> 00:10:01.262\nAnd so we need to make sure that for\nus, we try and\n\n181\n00:10:01.262 --> 00:10:04.185\nfigure out what the overall\nboundaries are, and\n\n182\n00:10:04.185 --> 00:10:08.766\nwhat can happen to our message when it\ndoes get communicated out in that way.\n\n183\n00:10:08.766 --> 00:10:13.473\nNow the one thing I forgot to emphasize,\nand I wanted to come back to is.\n\n184\n00:10:13.473 --> 00:10:17.775\nAccording to\nthe Project Management International,\n\n185\n00:10:17.775 --> 00:10:21.888\nthey emphasized a communication model so\nmuch so for\n\n186\n00:10:21.888 --> 00:10:26.283\nthe project manager that the PM,\nthe project manager,\n\n187\n00:10:26.283 --> 00:10:32.547\nshould be spending 90% of his particular\ntime in the project in mastering and\n\n188\n00:10:32.547 --> 00:10:37.340\nmaking sure that he manages\nthe communication, okay.\n\n189\n00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.650\nAnd I put that quote right there,\nand I absolutely overlooked it.\n\n190\n00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.530\nBut I want to make sure\nthat I emphasize that.\n\n191\n00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.250\nThis is how important it really\nis to project management.\n\n192\n00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.740\nThat we do the things that we need to and\nso\n\n193\n00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.500\nwe wanna make sure that we understand\nthat that's what's gonna happen.\n\n194\n00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.850\nThen the other thing is,\nwhat information do those people need?\n\n195\n00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:02.183\nNow if I sit there and go all right,\nDaniel's gonna be working on five or\n\n196\n00:11:02.183 --> 00:11:04.924\nsix different work packages for me.\n\n197\n00:11:04.924 --> 00:11:07.503\nI know I need to communicate\nthe information about five or\n\n198\n00:11:07.503 --> 00:11:10.160\nsix different work packages to Daniel.\n\n199\n00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.400\nBut, does Daniel, at that point,\n\n200\n00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.630\nalso need information about the other\n20 work packages that he doesn't need?\n\n201\n00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:22.920\nWell, no, he may ask about them, but\nremember, time is money on the project.\n\n202\n00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.400\nSo, what we need him to do is focus in and\nsay look, don't worry about those things,\n\n203\n00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.140\nlet's make sure that you'd get\nthe information that you need so\n\n204\n00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:34.180\nthat you can begin to efficiently\ndo the stuff that you need to do.\n\n205\n00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.000\nSo, you do also need to\nessentially filter out,\n\n206\n00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.120\nin other words make a distribution\nlist of what information that Daniel\n\n207\n00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.370\nreally does need on the project and\ninformation he doesn't need, right?\n\n208\n00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.887\nI'm not going to say that Daniel\nwould do something like this.\n\n209\n00:11:47.887 --> 00:11:52.475\nBut if I tell him, man I'm really\nhaving problems with Joe over here, and\n\n210\n00:11:52.475 --> 00:11:55.890\nDaniel now takes that back and\nhe starts sharing that.\n\n211\n00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:00.600\nRonnie is really upset with Joe, well that\ndoesn't help him to fulfill his needs.\n\n212\n00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.700\nBut it gives him fodder,\n\n213\n00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.320\nit gives him fire to be able to realize\nsomething that Ronnie can be getting upset\n\n214\n00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:10.020\nat Joe very easily over something that\nI don't need to actually worry about.\n\n215\n00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.800\nAnd then he may start to\nworry about it himself.\n\n216\n00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.630\nSo we also need to identify\nthe information that each particular\n\n217\n00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:20.480\nstakeholder needs, and try and\nfocus in on that particular side of it.\n\n218\n00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.240\nNow, it seems logical, right?\n\n219\n00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.990\nThere's nothing that you and I,\n\n220\n00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:27.900\nif we had a regular conversation,\nthat we wouldn't do.\n\n221\n00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.820\nBut remember with project information,\nespecially since you're working on\n\n222\n00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:36.370\na timeline, on a limited schedule,\non a limited budget here,\n\n223\n00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:40.350\nwe need to make the best and\nefficient use of our communications.\n\n224\n00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:43.660\nIt's not about just going around and\nsaying let's just grab a donut at some\n\n225\n00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.910\ntime this afternoon and\nthen we'll talk about it.\n\n226\n00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.810\nEven though you can do stuff like that,\n\n227\n00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:51.580\nit's about making sure that the proper\ninformation does get to the right person.\n\n228\n00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:55.540\nDistribution list is by far the key,\nand one of the things that you wanna\n\n229\n00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.770\nmake sure that you do is that\nyou write this stuff down, okay?\n\n230\n00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:03.270\nIf not, you're gonna find out before you\ngo and talk to someone if you're doing it\n\n231\n00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:07.190\nextemporaneously you're gonna reveal\nmore than you actually realize.\n\n232\n00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.565\nBecause you and\nDaniel may have a great friendship and\n\n233\n00:13:09.565 --> 00:13:12.610\nyou'll talk about things outside\nof the project, which is fine.\n\n234\n00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:16.620\nBut, remember when you reveal more,\nyou gotta realize that that information\n\n235\n00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.720\ncan end up being used differently\nthan you chose for it to be used.\n\n236\n00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.310\n>> That's right.\n\n237\n00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.350\nYou gotta be really careful.\n\n238\n00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:26.040\nI think the old World War IIs used to\nhave a lot of propaganda sayings and\n\n239\n00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.200\nslogans and one of them was,\nloose lips sink ships.\n\n240\n00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.430\nDon't talk about things that\ndon't need to be talked about.\n\n241\n00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:35.232\nKeep it in the realm of when\nit comes to the business or\n\n242\n00:13:35.232 --> 00:13:39.774\nthe project in only the vein that it needs\nto be in, not anything extraneous to that.\n\n243\n00:13:39.774 --> 00:13:43.348\nAnd not that you can't have good friendly\nconversation, that's always encouraged,\n\n244\n00:13:43.348 --> 00:13:46.900\njust make sure not to overstep any bounds\nwhen it comes to the project itself.\n\n245\n00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.690\nNow Ronnie,\nonce we've figured out exactly who it is,\n\n246\n00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:54.280\nwho these key people are in our\ndistribution list, what is a good way for\n\n247\n00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.600\nus to actually engage\nthem in communication?\n\n248\n00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.170\nObviously, as you've been saying,\n\n249\n00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:02.380\nthe informal approach is not\nthe best way to go about.\n\n250\n00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.270\n>> There's no doubt.\n\n251\n00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.870\nWhat you have to do is,\nbecause you're managing it,\n\n252\n00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.600\nright, especially information\nabout your project.\n\n253\n00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.290\nYou may go ahead and\n\n254\n00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:14.180\nestablish what are the clear channels that\nshow that the information came from you.\n\n255\n00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.010\nNow you might go,\nwhat are we talking about?\n\n256\n00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.160\nWe're talking about the proper\nformating of information.\n\n257\n00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.670\nSo let's go ahead and take a look.\n\n258\n00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.680\nI went ahead and\nlisted a couple of these for us here.\n\n259\n00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.330\nWe wanna make sure that we\nknow how the information\n\n260\n00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.140\nis gonna be distributed as well.\n\n261\n00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:33.120\nAnd normally for us in general\ncommunication terms, we have of course\n\n262\n00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:37.535\nwhat we call formal communications and\nthen some type of informal communication.\n\n263\n00:14:37.535 --> 00:14:39.730\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n264\n00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:42.760\nAn informal communication\nis just like we said,\n\n265\n00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.760\nwe run across each other in the hallway,\nand Daniel just turns and says, hey,\n\n266\n00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.328\nRonnie, how's that project going on?\n\n267\n00:14:48.328 --> 00:14:50.520\nAnd I start, man,\n\n268\n00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.850\nI can't even begin to tell you all\nthe problems I'm dealing with.\n\n269\n00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:58.020\nAnd that is just an informal communication\nthat ends up happening there.\n\n270\n00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.960\nAnd remember, even though you might\nnot have intended to say anything,\n\n271\n00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.600\nDaniel gleans onto certain\nwords that he knows you,\n\n272\n00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.480\nhe understands maybe the tone that\nyou've actually expressed to them.\n\n273\n00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.380\nHe may understand your frustration even.\n\n274\n00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:14.070\nBut again, he could talk to somebody\nelse and then they get a sense,\n\n275\n00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:16.770\nespecially if it's a stakeholder,\nthat says whoa wait a minute.\n\n276\n00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:20.700\nI've now learned something from Daniel\nthat maybe I didn't need to learn.\n\n277\n00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.990\nOr that actually raises my concern as\na stakeholder to come back to Ronnie.\n\n278\n00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:30.460\nIt's fine, informal types of\ninformation can be distributed and\n\n279\n00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.250\nas long as you realize that that is\nsome type of informal communication and\n\n280\n00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.896\nthat you're actually revealing that,\nit's no big deal.\n\n281\n00:15:36.896 --> 00:15:40.670\nBut normally when it's something\nofficial in which you're going to be\n\n282\n00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:44.160\nexpressing some type of\nchange in your project.\n\n283\n00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.760\nSome type of information that really\nneeds to get out there in a proper manner\n\n284\n00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.130\nis gonna be in a formal type of setting or\ncommunication as well.\n\n285\n00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:53.620\nNow, what do we mean by that?\n\n286\n00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.858\nWell, normally it might be in writing,\nokay?\n\n287\n00:15:55.858 --> 00:15:59.236\nNow it doesn't matter what the actual\nform of writing is, but it can.\n\n288\n00:15:59.236 --> 00:16:03.945\nIn other words when you actually do\na project management communication\n\n289\n00:16:03.945 --> 00:16:08.496\nplan You may say that if the project\nfalls behind by this much, okay,\n\n290\n00:16:08.496 --> 00:16:12.971\nthat what will happen is that a written\nletter or some type of written\n\n291\n00:16:12.971 --> 00:16:17.465\ncommunication will end up happening and\nit will be hand delivered.\n\n292\n00:16:17.465 --> 00:16:20.005\nYou can actually express\nsomething like that, or\n\n293\n00:16:20.005 --> 00:16:24.067\nit will be sent by registered mail or\ncertified mail, whatever you might want.\n\n294\n00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:27.903\nOr, it will actually be\nwhere I make an appointment,\n\n295\n00:16:27.903 --> 00:16:32.680\nand I stress that this is\nan official notification, right.\n\n296\n00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.770\nSome type of formal setting.\n\n297\n00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.090\nNow, normally when we do\nthis with stakeholders,\n\n298\n00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.560\nright, it's usually a meeting of\nsome sort, in which I schedule.\n\n299\n00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.450\nAnd I go, Daniel, I really need\nto talk to you about the progress\n\n300\n00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:47.200\nof what's going on in our project, and\nwe may need to make some adjustments and\n\n301\n00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.390\nwe set that meeting up and\nthat's a formal communication.\n\n302\n00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.410\nIt doesn't mean that I have to\nactually hand that to him in writing\n\n303\n00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:52.950\nbut it means what?\n\n304\n00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:56.440\nThat I've established that this is\nthe formal communication method\n\n305\n00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.640\nto express my concerns.\n\n306\n00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.782\nWhen you start doing this\nto your project team,\n\n307\n00:17:00.782 --> 00:17:04.223\nthe way that they know this is happening\nis that you normally announce well.\n\n308\n00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:08.576\nEither in a scheduled meeting, like\na project status meeting, you're actually\n\n309\n00:17:08.576 --> 00:17:12.546\nsaying I want updates and I want to bring\nyou up to status that this is a formal\n\n310\n00:17:12.546 --> 00:17:17.120\nmethod of communication because\neverybody on the team knows about it.\n\n311\n00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.330\nOr you call an unscheduled\nmeeting together, and\n\n312\n00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:24.400\nyou're saying here's a formal\nannouncement that, here it is.\n\n313\n00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.180\nI'm gonna be moving off of this project\nand Daniel's gonna be taking over.\n\n314\n00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.550\nWell, that's a formalized method\nof communication that we may\n\n315\n00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:33.320\nalso need to think about.\n\n316\n00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.030\nSo information can be\ncommunicated in both ways, but\n\n317\n00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:39.710\nyou need to know how it's\nactually communicated.\n\n318\n00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:41.560\nSo you wanna establish plans and that.\n\n319\n00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.490\nSo in other words,\nin informal communications you, again,\n\n320\n00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:48.560\nneed to know who did you talk to and when\nis it actually appropriate to talk about\n\n321\n00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.820\nproject management stuff in the informal\nside and who do you talk about it to?\n\n322\n00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.900\nSo there may be things that I\nshare with Daniel informally\n\n323\n00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.110\nthat I wouldn't actually\nshare with Joe informally.\n\n324\n00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.620\nOkay, that's what it comes down to or\nMike informally.\n\n325\n00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.530\nI go, all right Daniel,\nI'll talk to about this,\n\n326\n00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:05.560\nbut I don't want to say that to Mike.\n\n327\n00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.420\nYou just have to know that so\nyou know exactly who you're talking to,\n\n328\n00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.630\nand when somebody says, I shared this,\nI go, whoa, wait a minute.\n\n329\n00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:16.730\nYou take a look at your communications\nplan, go, man, you may have to go back and\n\n330\n00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.040\ntell them that, hey, this is not official,\nwhatever it might be, but\n\n331\n00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:20.880\nyou need to do that.\n\n332\n00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.360\nNow, the other way that we talk about,\nhere on my slide is written and verbal.\n\n333\n00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.690\nNow CompTIA officially calls that verbal,\n\n334\n00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:32.310\nwhat we really mean is oral communication,\nright, verbal is using words.\n\n335\n00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:35.510\nWe can use words and\nwritten as well as oral here.\n\n336\n00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:37.460\nBut we're talking about\noral communications and\n\n337\n00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:39.370\nwritten communications, right?\n\n338\n00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:41.370\nIf it's written you\nestablish the means and\n\n339\n00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:44.380\nthe methods in which somebody's\ngonna end up receiving that.\n\n340\n00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:48.950\nAnd so if it's a formal communication,\nusually it's gonna be written.\n\n341\n00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.020\nThe verbal though, or\n\n342\n00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.850\nthe oral communication gives\nyou a different impact right?\n\n343\n00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:59.930\nWe've all done this at some point in time\nin which you've read a text message and\n\n344\n00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:04.210\nyou've mistaken it because it\ndidn't make the actual tone\n\n345\n00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:07.420\nof the impact the way that it needed to.\n\n346\n00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:11.960\nYou've maybe read a letter and misread it\nbecause of what you think it said, and\n\n347\n00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.050\nyou didn't actually hear how\nthe person really meant to say it.\n\n348\n00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:19.540\nSo a verbal has the ability,\nor oral has the ability to\n\n349\n00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:25.390\ncommunicate tone and the immediacy\nof what something needs to be done.\n\n350\n00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:29.790\nA written communication does\ndemonstrate force, does demonstrate\n\n351\n00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:34.380\na resolution here that, look,\nI'm establishing this as a paper trail for\n\n352\n00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.270\nyou to call me out on this if I need\nto later on to be able to do this.\n\n353\n00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.330\nBut you can miss the tone and\nthe communication.\n\n354\n00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.770\nAnd so you have to pick your method.\n\n355\n00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.850\nAnd a lot of times it may be different.\n\n356\n00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:50.730\nYou may realize that Daniel has\nmisinterpreted your formal communications,\n\n357\n00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.250\nas far as reading it goes, every time.\n\n358\n00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:57.010\nBut every time you've met face to face,\nhe's understood it perfectly.\n\n359\n00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.610\nOkay, well you may actually\nestablish that different for\n\n360\n00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:02.670\neach particular stake holder that\nyou need to communicate with.\n\n361\n00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:03.550\nOr during that meeting.\n\n362\n00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:07.940\nAnd so, it just really does depend\non how you choose to manage it.\n\n363\n00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:12.410\nBut you have to have some type of format\nof the communication that will be accepted\n\n364\n00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:17.510\nas the formal way, or as the actual\nchannel of communication for your project.\n\n365\n00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:21.520\nSo on a regular project team meeting\nprobably everything's gonna be oral.\n\n366\n00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.070\nIt's just gonna be verbal.\n\n367\n00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.750\nHow are you doing Daniel on the status,\ngive me an update.\n\n368\n00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:29.780\nWell, he can say, well,\nI haven't submitted my report yet.\n\n369\n00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.940\nPerfectly fine if you\nrequired paper reports.\n\n370\n00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.457\nBut if he says, I'm doing well,\nyou might go, okay, that's great.\n\n371\n00:20:36.457 --> 00:20:38.090\nI'm ready to move on.\n\n372\n00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:41.080\nBut remember that there are some\nthings that you may have to actually\n\n373\n00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.350\ndo when it's written.\n\n374\n00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:46.310\nUsually this involves of course,\nwhen personnel changes happen.\n\n375\n00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.490\nCost changes happen,\nschedule changes happen.\n\n376\n00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.610\nThese may need to actually be\ndocumented by somebody else.\n\n377\n00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.230\nSo establishing it in that way as well.\n\n378\n00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.630\nSo just the format of\ncommunications is important.\n\n379\n00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.940\nThe distribution of who it goes\nto is important as well and\n\n380\n00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.420\nthere's a couple of other things we\nneed to pay attention to as well.\n\n381\n00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.310\n>> Yeah, one of the things I'm thinking\nof as you're going through this, Ronnie,\n\n382\n00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:14.210\nis you're saying that every now and then\nwe have to go to our project team members,\n\n383\n00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.820\npeople that are key to\na project we're working on.\n\n384\n00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:21.910\nAnd give some status updates,\ndo some information exchange of some sort.\n\n385\n00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.720\nWe're trying to do that\nin some formal way so\n\n386\n00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.550\nwhere we can document our progress and\nall the changes that are being made.\n\n387\n00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:30.130\nBut how often should we do this?\n\n388\n00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:31.780\nObviously, if we did it every day,\n\n389\n00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:35.750\nwe'd probably spend more time documenting\nprogress than actually making progress.\n\n390\n00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:36.640\n>> You're correct, right.\n\n391\n00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.330\nWe can have communication overload and\n\n392\n00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:41.300\nthat can be more dangerous\nthan you realize.\n\n393\n00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.680\nIf you're calling a meeting every\n\n394\n00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.840\ntwo hours to get an update when things\nneed to be done instead of that\n\n395\n00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:52.110\nyou can really frustrate the progress\nof your project overall.\n\n396\n00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:56.340\nSo even in your planning out\nyour communications, right.\n\n397\n00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:00.140\nYou wanna make sure that you\nestablish the periodic rate of this,\n\n398\n00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.630\nwhat we call the frequency\nof the communications.\n\n399\n00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.550\nSo let's take a look again as I put up\nthese bullet points to just help us\n\n400\n00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:06.840\nto remember, okay?\n\n401\n00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.370\nSo you may actually establish regular\nproject status meetings, let's say,\n\n402\n00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:12.380\nevery week, or every other week, okay?\n\n403\n00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.130\nDepends on what the scope of your\nproject is and how you do this.\n\n404\n00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.650\nIt may be daily for all you know.\n\n405\n00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:22.580\nIf there's a particular sub project\nthat's a 24 hour time crunch requirement,\n\n406\n00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:26.770\nyou may actually even do it hourly at\nthat point, if you really need to.\n\n407\n00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:31.290\nBut you just need to make sure that\neverybody understands the time that you're\n\n408\n00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:35.440\nactually expecting some type of update,\nor you're expecting the update as well.\n\n409\n00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.190\nThe other thing,\n\n410\n00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:41.050\nof course, is you may actually do it\non an incident basis instead, right?\n\n411\n00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:43.950\nThat you go, look,\nif there is some danger to human life,\n\n412\n00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:48.190\nin other words, if somebody's\nbeen injured, you want an update.\n\n413\n00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.980\nOkay, so you don't want them to pile\nthis up, and go, well, you know,\n\n414\n00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:54.140\nthis month we had 42 injuries,\nand you're, whoa, whoa, whoa!\n\n415\n00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:58.550\nWait, why am I just now\nhearing about it now?\n\n416\n00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:05.096\nWe'll you only told us to\nupdate you once a month.\n\n417\n00:23:05.096 --> 00:23:09.720\nYou got to actually realize and\nmake sure that you specific this.\n\n418\n00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.750\nThat when it is a danger to a human\nlife that you want it right away.\n\n419\n00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:18.280\nSomebody ends up in the hospital,\nyou want to know about it so\n\n420\n00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:22.250\nyou can actually report that to who you\nneed to as well, as fast as you can.\n\n421\n00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:26.140\nEspecially your insurance people,\nthey love to hear about it and go,\n\n422\n00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.850\nthere were 42 injuries.\n\n423\n00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:28.720\nWhen?\n\n424\n00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.090\nOver the last six weeks.\n\n425\n00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:32.660\nWhat, we had no clue about this stuff.\n\n426\n00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.080\nSo establish the actual frequency as well,\nso remember that.\n\n427\n00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.900\nThere's certain groups you can\nnotify on a less periodic basis,\n\n428\n00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.470\nother groups you'd need to\nnotify a little bit quicker.\n\n429\n00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:47.150\nBut it can be either, it's that weekly\nmeeting, or on a per incident basis.\n\n430\n00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:52.058\n>> Yeah, and Ronnie I would go to think\nthat any emergency, or critical type\n\n431\n00:23:52.058 --> 00:23:56.668\nof event would call cause for\nan immediate we need to talk about this.\n\n432\n00:23:56.668 --> 00:23:58.768\nLet's say you're working on a building,\n\n433\n00:23:58.768 --> 00:24:02.628\nyou're working on a structure of some\nsort, and the entire thing collapses.\n\n434\n00:24:02.628 --> 00:24:06.068\nMaybe no one was hurt, but\nthat's still pretty major.\n\n435\n00:24:06.068 --> 00:24:09.788\nThat's something you probably\nwant to go why did this occur?\n\n436\n00:24:09.788 --> 00:24:10.488\nWhat is going on?\n\n437\n00:24:10.488 --> 00:24:13.117\nYou're probably gonna call\na meeting at that point in time and\n\n438\n00:24:13.117 --> 00:24:16.690\nget some status reports and\nupdates why did this happen right?\n\n439\n00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:22.540\n>> It should be and you would think that\nlogical common sense makes this happen.\n\n440\n00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:27.590\nBut I have had people tell me well, you\nnormally don't want any news except for\n\n441\n00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:29.500\nthe regular status updates.\n\n442\n00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:33.254\nAnd you're saying well the status\nupdate was last week and [CROSSTALK]\n\n443\n00:24:33.254 --> 00:24:34.400\n>> A building fell down yesterday [LAUGH].\n\n444\n00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.720\n>> Yeah, the building fell down yesterday.\n\n445\n00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.270\nI should have known about this yesterday.\n\n446\n00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:43.400\nIt's not that I have to know everything,\nbut things when they happen, let's say for\n\n447\n00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:49.490\nIT ProTV, if our website goes down, that's\nour main method of communicating with you.\n\n448\n00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:52.170\nWe don't wanna know about it tomorrow.\n\n449\n00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.910\nWe wanna know about it right now.\n\n450\n00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.310\nWhy?\nSo that we can go ahead and\n\n451\n00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.640\nstart working on it and\ngetting it back up.\n\n452\n00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.550\nSomebody can say well, you know yeah,\n\n453\n00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:07.230\nwe updated this and yeah,\nit did break your website.\n\n454\n00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:09.220\nWe just forgot to tell you.\n\n455\n00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.930\nWell when did you forget to tell us.\n\n456\n00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:12.560\nWe changed it yesterday.\n\n457\n00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.350\nAnd you're troubleshooting everything that\nyou can, and now all we had to do was\n\n458\n00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:20.340\nactually make a phone call for someone\nthat actually said, hey, we need to\n\n459\n00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:24.690\nactually just change this one thing to\nget everything back up and running.\n\n460\n00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:25.350\nDoes that happen?\n\n461\n00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:29.450\nYes, it happens, and you might go,\nwhy is that happening?\n\n462\n00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.530\nIt's because of the way that\nthey formally communicate.\n\n463\n00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:36.600\nThey make changes to a site that's\nactually supposed to be up 24 hours a day,\n\n464\n00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.740\n7 days a week.\n\n465\n00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:41.910\nAnd they don't actually notify anybody\nthat they made this change, and\n\n466\n00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.650\nnow it could be that\nour site does go down.\n\n467\n00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:46.310\nIronically it did happen.\n\n468\n00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:48.970\n>> That's how they figure out what\ngoes wrong, right, they just say\n\n469\n00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:51.520\nwe're gonna make some changes and whatever\nbreaks people will start complaining and\n\n470\n00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.420\nthen we know where the problem is.\n\n471\n00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.450\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] But that's the last time, right?\n\n472\n00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:59.760\nWe would rather actually be a little\nbit more proactive, that hey,\n\n473\n00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.620\nwe made these changes.\n\n474\n00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.740\nIf you notice any problems,\nplease let us know immediately.\n\n475\n00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.170\nWell, for us, though, it was,\nwe made changes and nobody notified us.\n\n476\n00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:10.590\nAnd we're still there trying to go,\nokay, well, what's happening?\n\n477\n00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:11.920\nHow are we doing this?\n\n478\n00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.300\nAnd then, you figure it out\nlater when you finally call and\n\n479\n00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.120\ngo, did you all make any changes?\n\n480\n00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.069\nYeah, by the way, we made some changes.\n\n481\n00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:20.720\nWe forgot.\n\n482\n00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.150\nNo big deal.\n\n483\n00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.040\nIt's great on their end, no big deal.\n\n484\n00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.692\nOn our end a little bit more hairy,\nyou could say.\n\n485\n00:26:26.692 --> 00:26:28.600\n[LAUGH]\n>> Makes things a little more interesting\n\n486\n00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.485\naround the studio, that's for sure.\n\n487\n00:26:30.485 --> 00:26:32.080\n[LAUGH]\n>> Sometimes you do need\n\n488\n00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.980\nto make sure that you establish that.\n\n489\n00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.100\nAnd like I said,\na lot of times you go ahead and\n\n490\n00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.980\nmake that project plan management and\nthen you are ready to go.\n\n491\n00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:43.180\nThe other thing that we do wanna mention,\nof course, is the method of communication.\n\n492\n00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.790\nNow, this sounds very similar\nabout the idea of formatting, but\n\n493\n00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:48.260\nthe method here can be in any way.\n\n494\n00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:51.920\nNow, this is where you do have\nto decide on what's best, right?\n\n495\n00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.020\nIt could be email,\n\n496\n00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.538\nit could be that your entire team uses\nsomething like the project server.\n\n497\n00:26:56.538 --> 00:27:00.498\nAnd that's actually the background engine\nis some type of SharePoint server as well.\n\n498\n00:27:00.498 --> 00:27:04.640\nBut you go look, the formal communications\nis going to happen that way, okay?\n\n499\n00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.160\nIt might be a particular email\nwith a subject line in it.\n\n500\n00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.730\nIt could be that it is\na registered letter or\n\n501\n00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:12.680\na certified mail letter,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n502\n00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.640\nA phone call in the middle of the night,\nyou know, whatever it is.\n\n503\n00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.120\nIt might be actually a query that\nsomebody actually does come and\n\n504\n00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:24.880\nknock on your door and says, look, this\nis it, according to our project plan, we\n\n505\n00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:30.030\nneed to notify you in person within three\nhours of when something happened here.\n\n506\n00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.000\nI mean,\nespecially in emergency situations,\n\n507\n00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.720\nvoice mails, even though I don't\nlike using them, can you do it?\n\n508\n00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.760\nYes.\nOkay.\n\n509\n00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:37.930\nYou can make sure that you do that.\n\n510\n00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:40.770\nAnd then of course,\nwhen we start informal and formal,\n\n511\n00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:44.950\nwe're really normally talking about\nthe idea of a formal type of meeting.\n\n512\n00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:48.170\nCalled meetings are pretty\nmuch essential here.\n\n513\n00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.720\nProject kick-off meetings, right,\n\n514\n00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.590\nthat actually go move us from the planning\nstage into the execution stage.\n\n515\n00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:57.810\nScheduled meetings, all these\nare actually good things that can be done\n\n516\n00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:00.670\nthat really establish\nformal communications here.\n\n517\n00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:02.390\nAnd normally the information\nyou get here is not for\n\n518\n00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:04.570\nyou to go, I've heard that all before.\n\n519\n00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:07.400\nYou might learn something new and\nthat's why you want to establish that.\n\n520\n00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.720\nOn the informal water cooler types,\nit can happen, ok.\n\n521\n00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.820\nYou can share information that way.\n\n522\n00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.630\nBut make sure you establish that, hey,\n\n523\n00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:18.980\nthat's a method that we actually\ndo communicate in, don't take for\n\n524\n00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:23.030\nan assumption like I do at times, and\nit's like, well, you told me that over\n\n525\n00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:26.960\na french fry, when we're eating lunch,\nand I didn't know you were serious.\n\n526\n00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.310\nI've said that before, it's like,\nI didn't know you were serious.\n\n527\n00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:32.190\nI mean, we were laughing and then you\nsaid, hey by the way can you do this?\n\n528\n00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:35.150\nOf course I can and\nI didn't think about it again.\n\n529\n00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:36.980\nI mean, I didn't even write it down.\n\n530\n00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:42.770\nSo for me, but if you're gonna communicate\nthat way make sure you get that done.\n\n531\n00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:46.570\nHallway meetings that just happen\non the bypass as you go through,\n\n532\n00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:50.400\nall these are actually just regular\ntypes of things that end up happening.\n\n533\n00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.000\nNow, speaking of all that,\n\n534\n00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.120\nhow the heck do you keep track of\nall the stuff that you need to?\n\n535\n00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:59.940\nWell normally, you'd come up with some\ntype of project communication plan.\n\n536\n00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.540\nNow this is not the best plan,\n\n537\n00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.880\nit's one I came up with just\na couple of days ago here.\n\n538\n00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.870\nBut you're essentially establishing\na register is what you're doing,\n\n539\n00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:09.860\non the communication plan here.\n\n540\n00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.460\nAnd you're saying, hey,\nwho's actually gonna be a part of this?\n\n541\n00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.230\nAnd I filled in Daniel's here for\nright now, okay?\n\n542\n00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:19.070\nSo I actually list who it actually\nis that needs the information.\n\n543\n00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:22.250\nI say what the information\nI need to share with him.\n\n544\n00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:26.660\nAnd then at this point, I express the\nformatting type that needs to be written.\n\n545\n00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:30.460\nAnd the other thing that it needs to\nbe is that it needs to be in email.\n\n546\n00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.910\nI find out from Daniel,\nhe doesn’t check his mail but once a week.\n\n547\n00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:35.490\nAs far as the mailbox goes.\n\n548\n00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:39.290\nWell if that's true, but I know that\nhe checks his email constantly,\n\n549\n00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:43.230\nwell then i know that that's probably\nthe best information as well.\n\n550\n00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:47.590\nNow the other thing that we may also do,\nespecially in the communication plan,\n\n551\n00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:52.640\nis who is responsible for contacting\nDaniel, and giving him the information?\n\n552\n00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.890\nIt may be the project manager, or\nI may assign somebody else to do it.\n\n553\n00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.600\nAnd then we express the actual\nfrequency of this and\n\n554\n00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.590\nthis is some type of regular\nweekly communication.\n\n555\n00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:07.070\nThen, we can come back in here, on another\none and start filling in somebody else,\n\n556\n00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:08.020\nI'm just gonna pick on Mike.\n\n557\n00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:11.660\nAnd do the same thing.\n\n558\n00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.090\nAnd then you just continue to\nfill all the information in.\n\n559\n00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:17.530\nAnd now you have a register in this way.\n\n560\n00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:20.120\nWhen somebody says or\nif Mike calls me up and\n\n561\n00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:23.200\ngoes, hey, is there a reason\nwhy I'm not getting this?\n\n562\n00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.650\nI can flip to this and go, well, you\nshould have actually received this type of\n\n563\n00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:29.930\ncommunication and\nit should have been weekly.\n\n564\n00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:32.780\nAnd you may even keep another\ndocument that shows that you did\n\n565\n00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:35.720\ncommunicate with him on that\nparticular day, as well.\n\n566\n00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:40.720\nSo, you can use something like that and\nwe've actually created a template\n\n567\n00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.650\na while ago here where it actually\ndoes something like this.\n\n568\n00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:49.600\nSo maybe if you want to print this out on\npaper you can also communicate this way.\n\n569\n00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.730\nThe same type of information,\n\n570\n00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:54.650\nthis one of course should be\non a larger sheet of paper.\n\n571\n00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:57.890\nBut this one even has\nassumptions that you're making,\n\n572\n00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:02.660\nas well as even constraints that you\nmight actually communicate on too.\n\n573\n00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:08.000\nAnd also, if you're using specific terms\nthat may need to be defined here, you\n\n574\n00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.310\nwanna make sure that you add that in and\nany other accompanying details as well.\n\n575\n00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:14.380\nSo you may go ahead and attach this.\n\n576\n00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:17.690\nNow, you're probably saying when\nthe heck would I ever come up with this.\n\n577\n00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:21.810\nWell you're gonna do it if you're\ncreating that communication plan.\n\n578\n00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:25.300\nBut you're also gonna put a copy of\nthis inside the project management\n\n579\n00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:29.610\nportfolio book that you want to ensure\nthat the project management has a copy\n\n580\n00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:33.230\nof what the actual plan was so\nthat you can use it.\n\n581\n00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:34.530\nSo it's the same way,\n\n582\n00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:38.670\njust less graphic than the way\nI had it on my diagram instead.\n\n583\n00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:42.760\nBut you can see why this is very helpful\nwhen you do need to establish those\n\n584\n00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:47.685\nformal communications or any type of\ncommunication plan inside of your project.\n\n585\n00:31:47.685 --> 00:31:51.310\n>> Ronnie lot's of good information there\non developing a communications plan for\n\n586\n00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.540\neach one of our projects.\n\n587\n00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.650\nAll the steps necessary that are going\nto help us keep the information flowing\n\n588\n00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:59.700\nas necessary, keep that project\non the straight and narrow and\n\n589\n00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:00.860\nthat's what we like, right Ronnie?\n\n590\n00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:01.530\n>> It is.\n\n591\n00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:03.680\n>> All right, is there anything\nelse that we need to cover for\n\n592\n00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.560\nthis episode before we wrap things up?\n\n593\n00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.680\n>> Not for this episode, but\n\n594\n00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.820\nremember we're still in the midst\nof the planning stage right?\n\n595\n00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.270\nThere's still a few elements\nthat we need to cover.\n\n596\n00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:15.435\nIn the project planning this is gonna be\nthe longest element that we talk about\n\n597\n00:32:15.435 --> 00:32:17.840\nin overall project management.\n\n598\n00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:21.600\nBut it is a very important part\nof something that we've got to be\n\n599\n00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.400\nwilling to do.\n\n600\n00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.205\nIf you're like me you really\ndon't like communicating,\n\n601\n00:32:25.205 --> 00:32:27.450\n[LAUGH] well it still means you\nhave to learn how to do it.\n\n602\n00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:30.860\nYou still need to do it according\nto some particular channels here\n\n603\n00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.500\nto make sure that everybody's\non the same page.\n\n604\n00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.800\nGetting the right information to\nthe right people at the right time\n\n605\n00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:40.910\nwill help you out tremendously\nin your project management.\n\n606\n00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:45.920\nIf you can just get that information\ndown pat, you'll be ready to go.\n\n607\n00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.140\n>> Excellent stuff, Ronnie.\n\n608\n00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:49.180\nAnd as always, thank you so much for\n\n609\n00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:54.020\nexplaining these concepts to us, getting\nus ready for either our Project+ exam or\n\n610\n00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.820\njust to be better project\nmanagers in general.\n\n611\n00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.163\nThat being said it look like we've come\nto the end of another great episode.\n\n612\n00:32:59.163 --> 00:33:01.796\nHopefully you guys have learned a thing or\ntwo.\n\n613\n00:33:01.796 --> 00:33:04.850\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n614\n00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:05.740\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n615\n00:33:05.740

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.456\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:21.960\nwe are moving on with our Project+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.550\nJoining us back in the studio today,\n\n6\n00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.230\nto lend his gigantic wealth of\nknowledge in project management.\n\n7\n00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.120\nThat is our good friend and\nmentor, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.310\nRonnie, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n9\n00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.572\n>> Well thank you, as we continue\non to actually take a look at\n\n10\n00:00:34.572 --> 00:00:39.110\nCompTIA's Project+ as we're\ngetting ready for that exam.\n\n11\n00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.760\nAnd we're also getting ready for\nsome project management.\n\n12\n00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.690\nWe're moving into the area\nof more planning, right?\n\n13\n00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.660\nWe've just started taking\na looking at planning.\n\n14\n00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.420\nAnd we've talked about schedule\nplanning a little bit.\n\n15\n00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.170\nWe've also talked, of course, about the\nidea here of scope planning a bit more.\n\n16\n00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.500\nAnd now we're actually moving\ninto the realm of what we call,\n\n17\n00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.870\nof course, planning for risk management.\n\n18\n00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.400\nNow remember, we're not actually\npeople that are trying to come in and\n\n19\n00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.010\nunderstand the entirety and\nthe exhaustive nature of risk management.\n\n20\n00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.360\nBelieve it or not, you can actually\nget PHDs in risk management.\n\n21\n00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.180\nI am not a PHD in risk management.\n\n22\n00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.980\nLet me put it that way.\n\n23\n00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.950\nSo-,\n>> I know one.\n\n24\n00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.540\n>> Yeah, and you actually know\none that's related to you.\n\n25\n00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.200\nRight?\n\n26\n00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.790\nSo, but i'm not one that people, but I do\nunderstand that the nature of risk, right?\n\n27\n00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.120\nIs something that we all have to deal with\nin our regular, everyday daily jobs, but\n\n28\n00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.990\non projects, right, because we\nare constrained by time, by cost and\n\n29\n00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.340\nby quality or requirements that we have to\nactually be able to manage them much more.\n\n30\n00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.168\nThey have to actually be a little\nbit more in focus for us and\n\n31\n00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:43.572\nwe do need to consider them.\n\n32\n00:01:43.572 --> 00:01:48.102\nEvery day that we're actually running\na project we need to think about\n\n33\n00:01:48.102 --> 00:01:50.710\nthe idea of risks that\nwe end up taking and\n\n34\n00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.422\nmake sure that we understand how to\ndeal with them is pretty much the key.\n\n35\n00:01:55.422 --> 00:01:59.395\nSo that's where we are going to begin,\nand we're going to take a look and\n\n36\n00:01:59.395 --> 00:02:03.500\ntake our time to make sure we have at\nleast an understanding of how we plan for\n\n37\n00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.950\nrisk management itself.\n\n38\n00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.820\nSo I think that the key question though,\nfor us, Daniel,\n\n39\n00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.380\nright at the very beginning is,\na lot of times, the term risk is used in,\n\n40\n00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.580\nat least every time that I think about it,\n\n41\n00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.030\nis always used in a very adverse way,\nthat when I say I'm taking a risk on this,\n\n42\n00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.210\nwhat I'm saying is, I have the potential\nto lose on this particular battle.\n\n43\n00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.789\nSo, whatever it is,\nwhen I say that I'm taking risks,\n\n44\n00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:36.598\nthere's always a potential for danger or\nfor loss that ends up happening.\n\n45\n00:02:36.598 --> 00:02:39.919\nSo that's what we're normally taking\na look at when we think about it.\n\n46\n00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:44.816\nBut in reality though,\nrisk itself can be, well, both, right?\n\n47\n00:02:44.816 --> 00:02:46.756\nIt can be something that's adverse, and\n\n48\n00:02:46.756 --> 00:02:49.807\nit can be something that's actually\neven positive on your side,\n\n49\n00:02:49.807 --> 00:02:53.140\nif the risk is actually worth\nthe venture and that's the key, right?\n\n50\n00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.660\nIs that you don't know which\nway it's actually gonna go.\n\n51\n00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.850\nBut then for a project manager though,\n\n52\n00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.860\nwe need to be able to manage\nthose risks a little bit better.\n\n53\n00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.580\nThe idea here is trying to deal with\nthe uncertainty, and because we do\n\n54\n00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.490\nhave those constraints we need to\nmanage uncertainties as much as we can.\n\n55\n00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.410\nAnd the way that we do that is by coming\nup with a way that we go ahead and\n\n56\n00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.790\nwe plan for the risk management.\n\n57\n00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.950\nSo when we start talking\nabout planning for\n\n58\n00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.780\nrisk management, there's really three\nbasic components to a risk management\n\n59\n00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.690\nplan that should be included at\nleast at the conceptual level.\n\n60\n00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.870\nAnd then we're gonna talk a little bit\nabout details on how we can actually see\n\n61\n00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.730\nsome of this stuff if we need to.\n\n62\n00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.270\nNow remember,\nwe're not actually doing risk management.\n\n63\n00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.180\nWe're saying, here's how we plan for\nhandling the risk that come about, but\n\n64\n00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.980\nyou still need to understand just\na little bit of those concepts.\n\n65\n00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.800\nSo let's go ahead and\nstart with an overview of\n\n66\n00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.730\nwhat normally is going to be inside\nof our risk management plans.\n\n67\n00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.160\nWhen it comes down to it, let's go ahead\nand take a look at my machine here.\n\n68\n00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.440\nAnd then we'll see.\n\n69\n00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.190\nSo I've created this diagram that gives us\na list of bulletpoints of things we should\n\n70\n00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.090\nconsider.\n\n71\n00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.070\nAnd we're gonna be walking through some of\nthese different considerations as well,\n\n72\n00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.770\nlittle bit more in detail.\n\n73\n00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.910\nThe first and foremost idea that we\nhave to actually be able to understand\n\n74\n00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.010\nis what is a risk to our project?\n\n75\n00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.370\nBut remember, it might not be a risk\nto anybody else at this point.\n\n76\n00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.910\nIn other words,\n\n77\n00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.060\nour project actually has several risks\nthat we always have to keep in mind.\n\n78\n00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.930\nWhen we take a look at\nthe project constraints,\n\n79\n00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.230\nthose are kind of the constraining risks\nthat we have to worry about, right.\n\n80\n00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.530\nThat we go something like,\nover budget at times.\n\n81\n00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.310\nOr we don't have enough time\nto complete the project and\n\n82\n00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.540\nwe may be facing penalties of some sort,\nor a project's\n\n83\n00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.960\nnot what the stakeholder actually\nwanted and so that's a risk as well.\n\n84\n00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.390\nBut so the first thing that we need to do,\nof course,\n\n85\n00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:46.430\nis be able to take our project and\nidentify as many risks as we can.\n\n86\n00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.040\nLet's not go into the analysis yet, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.660\nLet's just say that what we wanna try and\n\n88\n00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.420\ndo is identify as many risks as we\ncan inside of our project, right?\n\n89\n00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.410\nBecause it's better to actually\nbe able to to get everything and\n\n90\n00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.610\nthen eliminate the things that really are\nnot as risky as we think that they are.\n\n91\n00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.440\nThen to just actually center in and focus\nin on one risk and miss the rest of it.\n\n92\n00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.170\nSo we’re going to talk about\nthat a bit more in detail.\n\n93\n00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.340\nThe other thing then, after we actually\nidentify as many possible risks as we can,\n\n94\n00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.620\nwe are going to analyze\nthe potential impact.\n\n95\n00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.390\nEssentially, we're rating the risk.\n\n96\n00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.020\nRight?\n\n97\n00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.290\nThere are some things that\nare risky inside of our project.\n\n98\n00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.510\nI don't assign enough\nresources to finish a task.\n\n99\n00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.160\nWell that means that it's going to blow up\nat some point where I have to assign more\n\n100\n00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.780\nresources or\nit's not going to get finished at all.\n\n101\n00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.050\nThere could be a risk that somebody\nleaves our project and that does happen.\n\n102\n00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.250\nBut it actually depends on what is\nthe impact of that to our project and so\n\n103\n00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.200\nwhat we do is we take the risk and we\nactually analyze them and we essentially\n\n104\n00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.405\nrank them as what we'll end up doing here,\nso that then we can add a value or or\n\n105\n00:05:55.405 --> 00:06:01.495\nassign a value to it and see then what\nour actual response is going to be.\n\n106\n00:06:01.495 --> 00:06:05.615\nNow down here at the bottom, Daniel, I\nknow it's a little bit hard for us to see.\n\n107\n00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:08.545\nLet me see if I can zoom\nin just a little bit here.\n\n108\n00:06:08.545 --> 00:06:10.685\nNow normally I like to try and\n\n109\n00:06:10.685 --> 00:06:14.035\nkeep everything equal as far as\non the grammatical side, right?\n\n110\n00:06:14.035 --> 00:06:18.635\nSo I had identify and analyze, and\nthen down here at the bottom I have\n\n111\n00:06:18.635 --> 00:06:21.760\nappropriately responding to risk\nI have no verb in that at all.\n\n112\n00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.600\nSo, you're probably like,\nwhat the heck is going on there?\n\n113\n00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.990\nWell, because there is no verb for\nme to be able to say what I need to here,\n\n114\n00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.260\nI'm gonna do this kind of\nadverbial thing here which is,\n\n115\n00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.760\nwe need to appropriately\nrespond to the risk.\n\n116\n00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.920\nNow you might say, why is that important?\n\n117\n00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.130\nBecause the emphasis is\non the appropriately.\n\n118\n00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.560\nIt's not on the action,\nit's the appropriate response.\n\n119\n00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.480\nSo let me give you an example.\n\n120\n00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:55.350\nIf I accidentally spill, say, my beverage\nhere on the notes that I gave Daniel for\n\n121\n00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.680\nthe show, he might be a little bit upset\nat that, and normally, what he does is, he\n\n122\n00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.230\njust shakes the notes off, he kind of pats\nit dry and that's an appropriate response.\n\n123\n00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.640\nAn inappropriate response to\nthat is Daniel goes ahead, and\n\n124\n00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.560\nhe crumples the notes up, and\nthen he punches me in the face, okay.\n\n125\n00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.300\nIs that actually a response the risk?\n\n126\n00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.800\nYes, it is a response, okay, but\nis it an appropriate response?\n\n127\n00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.120\nWell, that's something that we as\nproject managers have to understand,\n\n128\n00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.410\nthat there are inappropriate\nresponses to risk and\n\n129\n00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.410\nthat there are appropriate\nresponses to the risk as well.\n\n130\n00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.360\n>> I'm guessing anything that\nfacilitates a crime is gonna be one\n\n131\n00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.980\nof those inappropriate responses.\n\n132\n00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:37.801\n>> It normally is and just about\nevery legal jurisdiction there is on\n\n133\n00:07:37.801 --> 00:07:43.326\nthe planet out there But that's\nsomething that we can under-emphasize,\n\n134\n00:07:43.326 --> 00:07:48.235\nis that there has to be an appropriate\nresponse to the risk itself,\n\n135\n00:07:48.235 --> 00:07:53.433\nbecause over-response to the risk\ncan put our project in danger too.\n\n136\n00:07:53.433 --> 00:07:57.979\nSo we need to talk about this idea of\nappropriately responding to the risk and\n\n137\n00:07:57.979 --> 00:08:02.606\nthat's why it doesn't make grammatical\nequality there when we take a look.\n\n138\n00:08:02.606 --> 00:08:04.566\nBut overall though, that's what-\n>> You work with what you got, Ronnie.\n\n139\n00:08:04.566 --> 00:08:06.766\n>> Yeah, we can do what we can do here.\n\n140\n00:08:06.766 --> 00:08:10.206\nBut risks is a big part of\nproject management too, and\n\n141\n00:08:10.206 --> 00:08:14.488\nas a project manager you do,\nyou need to be able to see that the risks\n\n142\n00:08:14.488 --> 00:08:17.260\nare there and\nthey just have to be managed.\n\n143\n00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.350\nDo you have to understand everything\nthere is to know about risks management?\n\n144\n00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.000\nNo, you don't have to understand\nevery single thing but\n\n145\n00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.180\nyou do need to know,\nat least these three things,\n\n146\n00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.610\nif you're going to actually be\ndealing inside of project manager.\n\n147\n00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.730\nAnd we're just going to take a look\nat each of those three concepts\n\n148\n00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.540\nas we kind of dive down into this.\n\n149\n00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:34.380\n>> That's right.\n\n150\n00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.280\nRonny makes a great point.\n\n151\n00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.910\nHe's laid out a really good path for\n\n152\n00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:40.920\nus to take in developing\nour risk management plan.\n\n153\n00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.910\nAnd I saw number one on that list, and\nit is the most appropriate spot for it.\n\n154\n00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:49.470\nIs that number one spot is\nthe idea of identifying the risks.\n\n155\n00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.750\nCuz it's kinda hard to plan for\n\n156\n00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:56.120\nrisks if you haven't even tried to\nassess what those risks might be.\n\n157\n00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:01.080\nHow can I think of how do I make this\nbuilding fireproof if I didn't think,\n\n158\n00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.730\nwell, this building might\none day catch fire.\n\n159\n00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.150\nThat's the risk, cuz I'm gonna be\nrunning electricity through it.\n\n160\n00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.750\nI'm gonna have people inside of it.\n\n161\n00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.810\nMaybe this is a restaurant.\n\n162\n00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:14.710\nThere's going to be open flame\nat some point in this time, so\n\n163\n00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:18.400\nthe risk that it could\ncatch fire starts to rise.\n\n164\n00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.180\nAnd, that's what we need to do.\n\n165\n00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:24.890\nWe need to assess what the risks are to\neach of our projects so that we can start\n\n166\n00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:31.900\nmaking a plan to work against those and\neliminate them if at all possible.\n\n167\n00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.590\nSo Ronnie, let's start there,\nor with identifying risks.\n\n168\n00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:35.690\n>> We definitely need to.\n\n169\n00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:39.170\nAnd the reason that we need to do\nthis is because a lot of times\n\n170\n00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.760\nwe think that we see everything, right.\n\n171\n00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:44.620\nWe're the project manager, and that for\nsome reason, just with the title itself,\n\n172\n00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:48.290\nthat gives us a little bit more\nomniscient eye than what we would have.\n\n173\n00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.870\nNow don't get me wrong,\nit gives you a good eye for\n\n174\n00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.650\nwhat can actually end up happening, but\nthe problem that we have is fairly simple,\n\n175\n00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.260\nit's still from our one perspective.\n\n176\n00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.060\nSo that means that we might not\nhave actually considered anything\n\n177\n00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.780\nmore than what we can see and that can be\n\n178\n00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.530\nvery limiting especially when we start\ntalking about the idea of risk here.\n\n179\n00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:10.180\nSo how do we plan for this,\nhow do we start to identify risk?\n\n180\n00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.010\nWell let's take a look at the list\nthat I actually created here and\n\n181\n00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.200\nthen we'll talk about\nthem briefly as well.\n\n182\n00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.020\nSo one of the first things that we can\ndo is what we call brainstorming, okay.\n\n183\n00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.710\nThis is exactly like it's sounds.\n\n184\n00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:25.560\nAs we start our project planning,\nespecially on risk management, we may want\n\n185\n00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:30.500\nto get together people, especially people\nthat have actually had experience in this,\n\n186\n00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:35.650\nto have them talk about what are some of\nthe risk that they faced in their project\n\n187\n00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:37.860\nand even try and\nfigure out how they overcame it.\n\n188\n00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.280\nSo that, that way you can actually\ntalk about a little bit more.\n\n189\n00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:45.210\nBut you just have them come out with every\npossibility that can actually be a risk to\n\n190\n00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.620\nyour project, and this includes whether\nit's adverse to your project or\n\n191\n00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:51.510\nwhether some that's\npositive on the risky side.\n\n192\n00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.840\nIn other words there's like,\nman I did this, but\n\n193\n00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.170\nit actually turned out to be this.\n\n194\n00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.470\nYou want to actually see the entire\nof comprehensive list here.\n\n195\n00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.450\nBrainstorming is one of the best ways,\n\n196\n00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:05.000\nespecially with multiple groups of people\nhere, that will ensure that you get a much\n\n197\n00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.430\nmore comprehensive list from\ndifferent perspectives.\n\n198\n00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.860\nAnd that may help you out\nmore than you realize.\n\n199\n00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.020\nBecause there are some things you\nmay be really good at seeing,\n\n200\n00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.700\nand there's other things because of your\ninexperience in that particular area,\n\n201\n00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.650\nyou may not be good at seeing.\n\n202\n00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.893\nSo brainstorming is a big one,\nif you do happen to\n\n203\n00:11:21.893 --> 00:11:26.406\nhave subject matter experts on hand or\nexperienced people on hand,\n\n204\n00:11:26.406 --> 00:11:30.067\nthe second one is also a good one for\nus to take a look at.\n\n205\n00:11:30.067 --> 00:11:33.898\nWhich is just interviewing certain people,\nis what we want,\n\n206\n00:11:33.898 --> 00:11:37.876\nnow there are of course questions\nthat you can ask about trying to\n\n207\n00:11:37.876 --> 00:11:41.432\nactually identify what the risks\nare to certain things.\n\n208\n00:11:41.432 --> 00:11:43.629\nIs it on my critical path?\n\n209\n00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:46.250\nWhat is it that I need to\ndo on stuff like this?\n\n210\n00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:49.900\nHow many dependencies actually\nwork on this one task?\n\n211\n00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.960\nYou know, there's some different questions\nthat you can have, that you may have for\n\n212\n00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.610\na particular subject matter expert,\nthat can really help you to identify\n\n213\n00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:02.500\nnot only what risks are there or\nwhere you're possibly gonna face them.\n\n214\n00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.410\nSo, being able to actually work\nthrough an interviewing process,\n\n215\n00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:09.700\nespecially when you have that time and\nthat ability to call somebody in,\n\n216\n00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:14.770\nthat is an invaluable, insanely invaluable\ntime that you can spend, as long\n\n217\n00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.460\nas you're not just shooting the breeze\nabout your favorite basketball team,\n\n218\n00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.430\nor baseball, or\nwhatever sport that you like.\n\n219\n00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:24.370\nDon't get me wrong, those are always nice\nbut if you've got that person there, you\n\n220\n00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.460\nwanna make sure that you take advantage\nof the time that you have with them.\n\n221\n00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.810\nInterview them and make sure you ask\nthem about some of the things that can\n\n222\n00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:34.890\nhappen if you choose to do a project\nlike this, or if you're actually doing\n\n223\n00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.900\nthe same thing that they did so\nthat you can figure it out more.\n\n224\n00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:43.980\nThat experience right there is so\ninvaluable to you that you'll actually\n\n225\n00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.890\nget a sense that hey, this interview was\nworth the time and the effort it took for\n\n226\n00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:54.520\nme to gain that perspective and that is\nabsolutely cool when you start seeing it.\n\n227\n00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.380\nAnd of course there are always workshops,\nright, and the idea of the workshop is\n\n228\n00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:02.680\nfrom people that are gonna be working\nwith you on the project team itself.\n\n229\n00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.660\nAnd you essentially are facilitating\nthe idea that, hey,\n\n230\n00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.890\nwhat we're trying to do here is discover\nand identify all the risks that we have.\n\n231\n00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:15.210\nSo if you do have multiple project teams\nthat are working for you, you wanna hear\n\n232\n00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:19.310\nfrom their perspective, and you wanna hear\nthe answers to certain questions as well,\n\n233\n00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:22.650\nyou facilitate those workshops\nto help you out too.\n\n234\n00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:27.421\nAnd do not overlook the very fact\nthat there's always common types of\n\n235\n00:13:27.421 --> 00:13:30.967\nrisks that all of us end\nup facing at times, right?\n\n236\n00:13:30.967 --> 00:13:31.687\n>> Meteors.\n\n237\n00:13:31.687 --> 00:13:32.847\n>> Yeah, meteors-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n238\n00:13:32.847 --> 00:13:33.683\n>> Is a big one.\n\n239\n00:13:33.683 --> 00:13:37.600\nTidal waves, in Texas,\nI guess it could happen.\n\n240\n00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.935\nThey do have a Gulf there.\n\n241\n00:13:39.935 --> 00:13:43.614\n[CROSSTALK] Let's say\ntidal waves in Montana.\n\n242\n00:13:43.614 --> 00:13:45.530\nOr Nebraska\n>> Yeah.\n\n243\n00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:46.570\n>> That might be a big one.\n\n244\n00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:47.270\n>> Real problem there.\n\n245\n00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.720\n>> Yeah real problems when\nyou start seeing stuff.\n\n246\n00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.440\nBut, overall, though right,\nthere are common types of things\n\n247\n00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.360\nthat we just don't consider,\nbecause they are so common.\n\n248\n00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.420\nBut these are things that really\ndo matter on our project.\n\n249\n00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:03.280\nSo taking a look at each one of those and\nthen identifying\n\n250\n00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:07.460\nall the risk that we possibly can\nwill lead you to this mountain, okay?\n\n251\n00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.600\nThat's the reality of it, okay?\n\n252\n00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.420\nNow the problem that we have\nnow is that there may not\n\n253\n00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.220\never be that many risks that\nwill ever hit your project.\n\n254\n00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.410\nIt's pretty much the truth, your\nprobably not gonna capture everything.\n\n255\n00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:23.850\nBut, at this point, right, what you can\ndo is eliminate the things that you go\n\n256\n00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:26.190\nare insanely less likely to happen.\n\n257\n00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.580\nIn other words, you can actually\njust make a guess and go, well,\n\n258\n00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.960\nwe're not in this state where we\nhave to deal with stuff like that,\n\n259\n00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.010\nlet's just mark that one off the list.\n\n260\n00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.910\nSo you can probably eliminate a good\nportion of everything that you got\n\n261\n00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.180\njust by going that doesn't count\nhere in this particular state.\n\n262\n00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.290\nIt doesn't account here for\nwhat we're doing,\n\n263\n00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.198\ncuz it's not a part of\nthat type of project.\n\n264\n00:14:45.198 --> 00:14:48.743\nBut you can eliminate a lot of them and\nthat now leaves you\n\n265\n00:14:48.743 --> 00:14:53.274\nwith essentially the handful of risks\nthat you can actually deal with or\n\n266\n00:14:53.274 --> 00:14:55.711\nyou might have to actually consider.\n\n267\n00:14:55.711 --> 00:14:59.455\nAnd the problem that you have there is,\nhow do you know what to actually\n\n268\n00:14:59.455 --> 00:15:02.184\ndo with those risk,\nhow to actually assess them and\n\n269\n00:15:02.184 --> 00:15:06.540\nfigure out how much value assigned to\nthem and that's what we also need to do.\n\n270\n00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:11.260\n>> So, Ronnie you're telling us that we\nneed to even though there is a litany of\n\n271\n00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:15.580\npossible risk that could occur we\nmake some hyperbole and make fun and\n\n272\n00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.510\nsay title waves in Nebraska and\nmeteorites and\n\n273\n00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.690\nI would almost venture to say\nit's veritably impossible for\n\n274\n00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:28.340\nthere to be a tidal wave in Nebraska,\nbarring a large meteor striking the ocean.\n\n275\n00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.620\nI guess we've got bigger problems\nto fry at that point, but\n\n276\n00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.030\nwe want to take those\npossibilities out of the way and\n\n277\n00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:38.010\nwe want to come down to what\nis most probable to occur.\n\n278\n00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:39.720\nWhat are some of the inherent,\n\n279\n00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.600\nintrinsic risks involved in\nthe project that we're undertaking?\n\n280\n00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.778\nThat's going to help you pare it down and\n\n281\n00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:49.109\nfind out what is going to be the most\nlikely thing and then how do\n\n282\n00:15:49.109 --> 00:15:53.681\nwe attack that from there, try to mitigate\nthat risk altogether if at all possible.\n\n283\n00:15:53.681 --> 00:15:58.550\n>> That is right, and that's where we\ncome into the idea of the analysis of\n\n284\n00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:01.401\nthe potential impact of the risk itself.\n\n285\n00:16:01.401 --> 00:16:04.722\nAnd that is what we\nwant to get to as well.\n\n286\n00:16:04.722 --> 00:16:09.583\nThere's a lot of times where we look\nat a risk, and we look at another risk,\n\n287\n00:16:09.583 --> 00:16:13.284\nand we look at a third risk,\nand we look at them all and go,\n\n288\n00:16:13.284 --> 00:16:17.992\nwell, all of those are good possibilities\nof something happening, but\n\n289\n00:16:17.992 --> 00:16:21.655\nyou need to be able to assign\na value to them of some sort.\n\n290\n00:16:21.655 --> 00:16:23.190\nBecause the reality is this,\n\n291\n00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:26.600\nyou can't actually deal with\nevery single risk that you have.\n\n292\n00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.360\nYou'd spend a 100% of your project\ntime literally looking at every single\n\n293\n00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.890\npossible risk.\n\n294\n00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:37.786\nSo, instead you analyze the risk that\nyou believed that are actually real and\n\n295\n00:16:37.786 --> 00:16:40.190\nyou rank them in some way.\n\n296\n00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:45.350\nThe reason why we need to do this is\nthat we need to be able to do this so\n\n297\n00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:49.410\nthat we know where we're\nwilling to spend time and\n\n298\n00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:54.240\nresources to mitigating those risks or\ndealing with those risks at some point.\n\n299\n00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:59.140\nWe could say, all right,\nmeteor we believe that that's a risk.\n\n300\n00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.350\nWell, how much money of my project budget\n\n301\n00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:06.930\ndo I assign in dealing with\nthe impact of a meteor on my project?\n\n302\n00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:08.580\nWell, that’s a great question.\n\n303\n00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:13.450\nI have no clue how much money I\nwould even come close to assigning\n\n304\n00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:18.490\nto dealing with the idea of a meteor\nimpact, if I thought that was a risk.\n\n305\n00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.760\nBut there has to be a way that we do that.\n\n306\n00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.350\nSo what we’re now talking about\nis analyzing what the actual\n\n307\n00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.830\nimpact is gonna be, and we’re rating it.\n\n308\n00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:28.850\nSo how in the world do we tend\nto actually start the analysis.\n\n309\n00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.530\nLet me go and\ntake a look at this bullet point here.\n\n310\n00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:34.402\nAnd I just want to have them\nzoomed in just a little bit,\n\n311\n00:17:34.402 --> 00:17:37.500\nactually increased the font size, so\nwe don't have to keep zooming in here.\n\n312\n00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.690\nWhen we start talking about analyzing\nthe potential impact, you and\n\n313\n00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.715\nI need to take a look and\nfrom what we call our risk perspective,\n\n314\n00:17:45.715 --> 00:17:48.470\nour risk tolerance here is what we have.\n\n315\n00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:52.770\nSo when we start taking a look at\nthe idea of risk tolerance it breaks down\n\n316\n00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:57.990\nreally into three different\ncategories of how you\n\n317\n00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:02.620\ntend to be as a project manager,\nand of course how,\n\n318\n00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.270\neverybody else says, in other words,\nother stakeholders in your project.\n\n319\n00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:12.290\nIf you are like Daniel,\nyou might be what we call a risk taker.\n\n320\n00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.121\nI don't know if Daniel actually is, but\nI'm gonna say that he is a risk taker.\n\n321\n00:18:15.121 --> 00:18:18.893\nHe goes out to Vegas, and\non one roll of the dice,\n\n322\n00:18:18.893 --> 00:18:21.929\nhe's willing to be the whole shebang.\n\n323\n00:18:21.929 --> 00:18:23.311\nYeah, the whole thing, right?\n\n324\n00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:26.398\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n325\n00:18:26.398 --> 00:18:28.130\n>> But risk takers are willing to do\n\n326\n00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:28.970\nthat, right?\n\n327\n00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:33.573\nThey're willing to say look,\nI will bet my entire career on this, and\n\n328\n00:18:33.573 --> 00:18:35.612\nthey don't feel bad about it.\n\n329\n00:18:35.612 --> 00:18:37.783\nThey go look, if I lose, I lose.\n\n330\n00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:40.504\nSo, it could be that\nyou realize something,\n\n331\n00:18:40.504 --> 00:18:44.085\nyou have to actually understand\nyour own risk tolerance for\n\n332\n00:18:44.085 --> 00:18:49.150\nthings before you can actually decide\nwhat to actually rate something.\n\n333\n00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:56.960\nThere of course is also gonna be the risk\nneutral person, I can't spell neutral.\n\n334\n00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.270\n[LAUGH] The risk neutral person as well.\n\n335\n00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.950\nNow this risk neutral person,\n\n336\n00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:07.530\nwhen we start to take look,\nhis particular tolerance for risk is,\n\n337\n00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:13.070\nwell, not as great as the risk taker,\nbut he doesn't avoid it either.\n\n338\n00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:16.760\nHe absolutely sits there and\ngoes look, let's do this.\n\n339\n00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:21.820\nLet's just see how it plays out and\nif we need to take the risk,\n\n340\n00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:22.820\nwe'll take the risk.\n\n341\n00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.060\nIf we don't need to take it,\ndon't worry about it.\n\n342\n00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.530\nSo, you do have somebody\nthat can be risk neutral,\n\n343\n00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:29.910\nwhere they don't really care one way or\nthe other.\n\n344\n00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:32.400\nThey go,\nI'll just handle it as it comes along.\n\n345\n00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.330\nWe hope that we're that\nway a lot of times, but\n\n346\n00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:40.130\nthe fact is we're gonna lean probably\ntowards the risk taker or we're gonna lean\n\n347\n00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:44.940\ntowards the other extreme here, which is\nwhat we call the risk adverse person.\n\n348\n00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:52.300\nSo when we start taking a look at that\nidea, whereas the risk adverse person,\n\n349\n00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:58.650\nthey would rather do anything to\navoid as much risk as possible.\n\n350\n00:19:58.650 --> 00:19:59.490\nSo in other words,\n\n351\n00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:04.300\nthey may be willing to spend a lot more\nmoney just to make the risk go away.\n\n352\n00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.160\nI don't even want to take\nthe chance of that happening.\n\n353\n00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.650\nWhat can we do to ensure that the chances\nof that happening isn't even gonna even\n\n354\n00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:13.800\nremotely come near me?\n\n355\n00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.610\nBecause I don't want the stress\nof having to deal with that risk.\n\n356\n00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:21.560\nSo when we start analyzing it,\nthat's what you end up getting, right?\n\n357\n00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.280\nAnd this is where it's\nimportant in the analysis part\n\n358\n00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.930\nthat you have people that you trust and\nyou know what their risk tolerance is.\n\n359\n00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:34.250\nIf we get into a group and I'm the only\nrisk taker and Daniel and Mike and let's\n\n360\n00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:40.210\nsay Wes, they're all risk adverse, I bring\nup a subject, what are the chances that I\n\n361\n00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:45.230\ncan convince the other three that are risk\nadverse that this is worth the effort?\n\n362\n00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:46.480\nWhat do you think, Dan?\n\n363\n00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.270\n>> Well, in that scenario I would\nhave to say it's slim to none.\n\n364\n00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:53.260\nYou've got a majority of people that\nare gonna go, I'm completely risk adverse,\n\n365\n00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.540\nI think that's too big of a risk for\nus to take and\n\n366\n00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:01.430\nit's not, I always like to say, the juice\nisn't worth the squeeze, as it were.\n\n367\n00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.850\nI don't want to put myself out there and\n\n368\n00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:08.370\ntake that risk because of, for\nus, the loss would be too great.\n\n369\n00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:11.140\n>> Yeah, and so\nwhen you start seeing something like that,\n\n370\n00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:15.070\nwell this is the analysis that\nyou've gotta actually go,\n\n371\n00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:19.620\nif I know that I'm with a risk\ntaker as a project manager,\n\n372\n00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.500\nI need to probably have a balance\nas much as possible if we can, or\n\n373\n00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:28.760\nI need somebody that really does agree\nwith me as what we wanna take a look at.\n\n374\n00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.310\nSo, this are some of the things\nthat you've gotta consider when you\n\n375\n00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.040\nare actually planning this out,\n\n376\n00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.940\nis that the people that you have\nanalyzing it is not all one sided.\n\n377\n00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.340\nIt should sound natural, that makes sense.\n\n378\n00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.360\nBut remember,\nyou do have to consider that,\n\n379\n00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.740\ncuz not everybody will look\nat the risk in the same way.\n\n380\n00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:48.933\nAnd so, if you think that\neverybody agrees with you,\n\n381\n00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:51.663\nwhen you're doing the risk analysis,\nyou're probably wrong.\n\n382\n00:21:51.663 --> 00:21:54.020\n[LAUGH] I just want you to\nknow you're probably wrong.\n\n383\n00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.845\nRight off the bat,\nunless you have absolutely sampled and\n\n384\n00:21:56.845 --> 00:21:59.101\nrealized what the risk\ntolerance is gonna be.\n\n385\n00:21:59.101 --> 00:22:01.601\nIf they're the same as yours,\nyou probably will get an agreement, but\n\n386\n00:22:01.601 --> 00:22:02.358\nis that always good?\n\n387\n00:22:02.358 --> 00:22:05.733\nNo, because if you're actually\na risk taker, you may be willing to\n\n388\n00:22:05.733 --> 00:22:09.287\ntake on more risks in your project\nthan what somebody that sits there and\n\n389\n00:22:09.287 --> 00:22:12.545\ngoes, well, wait a minute,\nI don't think you should do that And\n\n390\n00:22:12.545 --> 00:22:16.890\nthen you end up silencing that voice that\nreally helps you to balance that out.\n\n391\n00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:21.070\nSo, the analysis part here is really\nsomething that we've gotta think about.\n\n392\n00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:27.390\nThe other thing, of course, is what we\ncall our risk probability here, too.\n\n393\n00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:30.280\nNow, when we start taking\na look at the risk probability,\n\n394\n00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.510\nwhat we're actually going to expect\nhere is just like what we said.\n\n395\n00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:37.490\nWe might go ahead and say,\n\n396\n00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:42.336\nlook, we need somebody that\nabsolutely can help us out here.\n\n397\n00:22:42.336 --> 00:22:47.180\nSo we may actually get that PhD in risk\nmanagement, says, look, I wanna know what\n\n398\n00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:53.300\nthe probability of that meteor hitting\nme during the middle of my project is.\n\n399\n00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.890\nAnd hopefully that guy won't take my\nmoney, because he knows without even\n\n400\n00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:02.500\nhaving to consult on anything, the chances\nof meteor actually, is slim to none.\n\n401\n00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:03.790\nBut might he?\n\n402\n00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:06.520\nYeah, if he goes,\nRonnie's willing to pay me, heck yeah!\n\n403\n00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.480\nI'll take the risk on that and\ngo ahead and do that.\n\n404\n00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.765\n>> Ronnie's taking a risk hiring him.\n\n405\n00:23:11.765 --> 00:23:14.884\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And of course the other one is,\n\n406\n00:23:14.884 --> 00:23:19.499\ntaking a look at other projects that\nare of the same scope and same type, and\n\n407\n00:23:19.499 --> 00:23:22.062\ntaking a look at historical data as well,\n\n408\n00:23:22.062 --> 00:23:25.089\nwill help us in some of\nour risk probability too.\n\n409\n00:23:25.089 --> 00:23:27.740\nNow, are there other\nways that we can do this?\n\n410\n00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.585\nSo, I'm just going to put historical.\n\n411\n00:23:32.941 --> 00:23:33.835\nWhat did I put here?\n\n412\n00:23:33.835 --> 00:23:35.262\nData.\n\n413\n00:23:35.262 --> 00:23:38.420\nSo we can actually use that\nto help us guide along.\n\n414\n00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.283\nBut there are other things that we can do,\n\n415\n00:23:40.283 --> 00:23:43.010\nespecially when we're\ntrying to figure this out.\n\n416\n00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:47.270\nAnd I went ahead and started on a little\nbit of a process here on the idea so\n\n417\n00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:50.370\nthat we can see it a little\nbit more graphically.\n\n418\n00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:53.500\nSo sometimes, you may go,\nlook on this idea of probability and\n\n419\n00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:58.490\nstuff, we're probably not gonna hit\nwhat we think we're going to hit here.\n\n420\n00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:01.912\nSo what you can do is you can do\nsomething like this and plot it out.\n\n421\n00:24:01.912 --> 00:24:07.092\nSo you might put the idea of impact on\na horizontal scale here, low to high.\n\n422\n00:24:07.092 --> 00:24:10.737\nAnd then on a probability scale, in other\nwords, what you actually encounter.\n\n423\n00:24:10.737 --> 00:24:14.880\nAnd that way you can kinda plot it out,\nwhat you believe is gonna happen here.\n\n424\n00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:19.180\nNow, the way that you do this\nthen is that you can come up with\n\n425\n00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:23.830\nsome type of matrix is what\nyou can come up with here.\n\n426\n00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:26.310\nAnd the way that I have this let me see.\n\n427\n00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:28.990\nIt looks like I'm gonna zoom\nin here just a little bit.\n\n428\n00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:30.620\nSo that we can see it.\n\n429\n00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.170\nIs that we may go ahead and\ndo something like this.\n\n430\n00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:35.410\nWhere we even color code it.\n\n431\n00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:39.630\nIf anything falls in this lower left hand\ncorner as far as the way that we've got us\n\n432\n00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:43.630\nscaled here, we might say, hey look,\nhere's a low risk situation that we\n\n433\n00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:47.420\ndon't really have to worry about\nWe can have high probability.\n\n434\n00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.660\nNow, there's some that actually can\nhave a high probability of occurring but\n\n435\n00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:54.870\nsomething that has low impact to my\nproject it might fall over here.\n\n436\n00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.070\nNow we have a low probability but\ncould have a high impact.\n\n437\n00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:01.850\nSomething like the meteorite is what\nwe're actually worried about on that end.\n\n438\n00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:06.030\nAnd the high probability, low impact is,\nlet's say that we have an old beat up\n\n439\n00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.620\ntruck that we just have\nto get started every day.\n\n440\n00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:12.800\nHigh probability of it not starting, but\nit really doesn't impact our work any.\n\n441\n00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.720\nLow probability and low impact,\nagain things we don't tend to worry about.\n\n442\n00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.950\nBut notice that we have this in the\ncomplete right, upper quadrant over here.\n\n443\n00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.350\nHigh probability, high impact.\n\n444\n00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:27.310\nThis is the actual quadrant that\ncan help us if actually do need\n\n445\n00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.090\nto know where to spend money.\n\n446\n00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:31.120\nNow, it doesn't mean you don't\nspend money on the other ones.\n\n447\n00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.220\nBut, what it means, that if anything comes\ninto this quadrant as far as the way that\n\n448\n00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:39.260\nyou've chosen to rate it, you may go, that\nexactly what I'm gonna spend money on, and\n\n449\n00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:42.980\nthat's part of the risk management plan\nthat we're actually taking a look at as\n\n450\n00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:50.090\nwell, and that's just a simple type\nof analysis that we can end up taking\n\n451\n00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:55.060\na look at now, if you want to actually\npull that in a little bit more than, so\n\n452\n00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.960\nhere's something that may actually\nhelp us out when we start doing it.\n\n453\n00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:04.850\nSo, we can actually do what we call\na probability and impact matrix itself to,\n\n454\n00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:09.260\nwhere we say, look, I'm gonna take this\nfour risk that I've now identified.\n\n455\n00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:14.600\nAnd when I do so we're gonna assign\na probability to them and also an impact.\n\n456\n00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.970\nAnd let's say that we do this\non a zero to one scale and\n\n457\n00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:21.240\nwe kinda marked it up in between in\nterms of tens and whatever we need to.\n\n458\n00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:26.220\nAnd so the way that we understand\nhow to take risk as a formula\n\n459\n00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.800\nis we multiply probability\ntimes Impact and\n\n460\n00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.660\nwe end up with what we call our risk\nscore so if I take the actual calculator,\n\n461\n00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:39.700\nright here, and\nthen I want to multiply times 15,\n\n462\n00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.604\ntimes 0.5 times 0.3.\n\n463\n00:26:43.604 --> 00:26:47.990\nWell, now my risk score here is 0.15,\n\n464\n00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:52.650\nnot very gigantic, but it is going\nto help us to make our point here.\n\n465\n00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:53.696\nWhat about risk B?\n\n466\n00:26:53.696 --> 00:26:58.410\nThe same thing, 0.16 times 1,\n\n467\n00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:02.950\nand that of course leaves it\nexactly the same here, 0.16.\n\n468\n00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:05.982\nAnd this one, I'm gonna do it\nwithout the calculator, cuz, 1.\n\n469\n00:27:05.982 --> 00:27:08.540\n[LAUGH]\n>> You've done that one before.\n\n470\n00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:11.500\n>> I've done that one before,\nso that one's actually easy.\n\n471\n00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:17.980\nAnd then the other one here is,\nlet me make sure I do that,\n\n472\n00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:23.791\n0.75 Times 0.5, 0.375, all right.\n\n473\n00:27:23.791 --> 00:27:30.300\nSo we can come up with what\nwe call this risk score.\n\n474\n00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:37.890\nAnd once we have that risk score, we can\nthen come back into our matrix here and\n\n475\n00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:40.860\ndepending on how we have it scaled\nout we can start plotting them now.\n\n476\n00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:44.240\nI've actually done it a little bit\ndifferent over here instead so\n\n477\n00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.170\nthat we can see it.\n\n478\n00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:49.190\nWe take those same numbers and\nwe start doing it here.\n\n479\n00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:55.040\nNotice that what I have is kinda a color\nscale that helps us out a little bit so\n\n480\n00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:59.280\nthis is, for us,\nthe easiest ones to kind of understand.\n\n481\n00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.930\nThe highest risk, of course,\nwill be in this upper-right quadrant.\n\n482\n00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.750\nThe high probability, low impact in\nthe upper-left quadrant over here.\n\n483\n00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:12.460\nLow impact,\nlow probability down here in lower-left.\n\n484\n00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:16.740\nAnd then of course high impact,\nbut low probability over here.\n\n485\n00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.790\nSo if I take probability then, and\n\n486\n00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:24.180\nI say, probability is about a point\nfive which is about half way.\n\n487\n00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:29.950\nBut the impact is point three,\nI'm gonna use this and maybe,\n\n488\n00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:34.210\nif I can actually get it 0.3 and five.\n\n489\n00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:37.780\nLet's say it goes\nsomewhere like right there.\n\n490\n00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:42.920\nI'm gonna copy that and\ntry to move that a little bit.\n\n491\n00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:48.482\nAnd the second one here, 0.16 as far\nas the probability which is down here,\n\n492\n00:28:48.482 --> 00:28:50.648\nbut the impact is gonna be a 1.\n\n493\n00:28:53.518 --> 00:28:58.718\nSo this is where you might actually\nend up being where you can see this.\n\n494\n00:29:02.428 --> 00:29:05.760\nAnd then the third one there is risk C,\nwhich is a one and a one.\n\n495\n00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.980\nWhich is right up here at the edge and\nthen of course for\n\n496\n00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.362\nrisk D copy that one here.\n\n497\n00:29:13.362 --> 00:29:17.597\n0.75 on the probability and\n\n498\n00:29:17.597 --> 00:29:21.210\n0.05 is right here, okay?\n\n499\n00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:25.110\nWell, now you can take\na look in a graphical way.\n\n500\n00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:27.830\nAnd say look,\nI've already made these decisions\n\n501\n00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:31.870\nthat the way I'm gonna spend my\nmoney is that it was high impact,\n\n502\n00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:34.880\nhigh probability we're absolutely\ngoing to do something about it.\n\n503\n00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.090\nSo anything in this upper right\nhand quadrant I'll go ahead and\n\n504\n00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:42.090\nI'll take a look and\ndo something about that.\n\n505\n00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:45.070\nAll these other ones I may\nmake other judgments on.\n\n506\n00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:49.220\nSo it does help you to be able to\nfigure out some of this information\n\n507\n00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.350\nas we do take a look here, right.\n\n508\n00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:57.440\nSo once you have these things listed out\nand you have graphical judgement of it,\n\n509\n00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:02.180\nthen at that point you can create\nwhat you call a risk register.\n\n510\n00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:07.210\nThe risk register allows you to be\nable to see whatever that risk is.\n\n511\n00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.840\nYou wouldn't just do risk you\nactually list it out here.\n\n512\n00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:14.150\nBut you can see this and\nthen you can actually determine whether or\n\n513\n00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:17.020\nnot you need a response plan to it\n\n514\n00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.680\naccording to the way that you actually\nplotted this thing out, okay?\n\n515\n00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.920\nSo that way you can do that,\n\n516\n00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.620\nand you just simply say do I\nhave a response plan for it, no.\n\n517\n00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:25.580\nDo I need one?\n\n518\n00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.210\nWell, it's possibly yes.\n\n519\n00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:30.280\nAnd then you can even assign a risk owner,\n\n520\n00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.550\nnow that risk owner is actually\nan important part of this.\n\n521\n00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:35.760\nAnd what you do, you go look,\nfor us to deal with this risk,\n\n522\n00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.550\nwho are we gonna assign this to or\nam I gonna have to deal with it?\n\n523\n00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:41.600\nAnd you list that as well, and now you\nactually have a plan where if somebody\n\n524\n00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.860\nsays well who is responsible\nto handle this risk?\n\n525\n00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.220\nI turn here to my risk register, and\n\n526\n00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:53.640\nI take a look, we do have a response plan\nand I've now assigned it to Daniel Lowrie.\n\n527\n00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:57.730\nAnd that way if there are questions on it,\nI bring Daniel into the meeting, and\n\n528\n00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:58.690\nthen we can talk about it.\n\n529\n00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:02.390\nAnd it shows that we do have a plan for\nmanaging risk itself.\n\n530\n00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:03.370\n>> Very, very cool.\n\n531\n00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:05.790\nAnd yes,\nhaving a good graphical representation\n\n532\n00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:08.550\nof the risks themselves is very,\nvery helpful for\n\n533\n00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:12.190\nus to figure out who is gonna be that\nperson that takes over those risks.\n\n534\n00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:16.030\nCuz maybe they have expertise\nin that area or who knows.\n\n535\n00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:19.565\nI love graphics,\nthey make my job a whole lot easier.\n\n536\n00:31:19.565 --> 00:31:21.995\nEasier, especially when it\ncomes to project management.\n\n537\n00:31:21.995 --> 00:31:24.035\nNow Ronnie I know we're running\na little short on time, but\n\n538\n00:31:24.035 --> 00:31:25.370\nI'm willing to take a risk.\n\n539\n00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:27.185\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And let us go a little bit long.\n\n540\n00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:28.105\n>> Okay.\n>> Cuz I know you only have\n\n541\n00:31:28.105 --> 00:31:28.945\na little bit more to go.\n\n542\n00:31:28.945 --> 00:31:31.495\n>> All right.\n>> And let's move on from there.\n\n543\n00:31:31.495 --> 00:31:34.975\nI know you got one more good topic for us\nto cover when it comes to risk management.\n\n544\n00:31:34.975 --> 00:31:36.065\n>> We really do.\n\n545\n00:31:36.065 --> 00:31:37.535\nOur last topic here, right?\n\n546\n00:31:37.535 --> 00:31:40.420\nSo let's go back to see what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n547\n00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:44.590\nSo on my computer, we've talked about\nidentifying the actual risk of self.\n\n548\n00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:46.970\nWe've talked about analyzing\nit's potential impact.\n\n549\n00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:49.050\nWe didn't go super deep into it, right?\n\n550\n00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:50.760\nThese are thing you'll have to learn, but\n\n551\n00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.580\nat least understanding the plan\nbehind it is pretty much key.\n\n552\n00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.290\nAnd now we just need to talk about this.\n\n553\n00:31:55.290 --> 00:32:01.157\nThe appropriately responding to the risk\nitself is what we need to take a look at.\n\n554\n00:32:01.157 --> 00:32:04.283\nAnd so\nwhen we get all the way back over here and\n\n555\n00:32:04.283 --> 00:32:09.322\nlet's take a look at the ways that we\nactually do respond to this as well.\n\n556\n00:32:09.322 --> 00:32:12.342\nAll right, so let me see if I can zoom in.\n\n557\n00:32:12.342 --> 00:32:15.918\nNow, when it comes down to us\ntaking a look at risks okay,\n\n558\n00:32:15.918 --> 00:32:21.840\nyou've gotta realize something especially\nfor your risk tolerance and what you have.\n\n559\n00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.560\nThere's only five different methods\nthat we can deal with risk,\n\n560\n00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.070\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n561\n00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:27.580\nOkay.\n\n562\n00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.840\nSo a risk response strategy\nincludes avoidance, transference,\n\n563\n00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.090\nmitigation and acceptance.\n\n564\n00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.350\nAvoidance is exactly like it sounds.\n\n565\n00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:41.850\nWe do what we can to ensure that that\nrisk never gets realized at all, okay?\n\n566\n00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:43.960\nNow, how do we do something like that?\n\n567\n00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.520\nWe can simply say, well, Daniel,\n\n568\n00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:48.620\nwhen it comes down to it we're\nnot gonna do this project.\n\n569\n00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:49.640\nDrop the project.\n\n570\n00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.040\nIt pretty much eliminates the risk.\n\n571\n00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.970\nI avoid it overall.\n\n572\n00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:59.050\nNow if it's with a potential personnel\non my project, I can say what?\n\n573\n00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:04.030\nWell, we're not gonna use that person and\nwe drop the risk as far as that person\n\n574\n00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:08.970\nmaybe being too volatile or maybe not\nshowing up or, we just can't you know,\n\n575\n00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:12.450\nrely on their performance at this point.\n\n576\n00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:13.770\nAnd we need somebody reliable.\n\n577\n00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:15.170\nWe can simply avoid it by what?\n\n578\n00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:17.460\nBy not using that person too.\n\n579\n00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.090\nOkay.\n\n580\n00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:21.920\nSo, the idea of avoidance here is that,\nespecially if it's avoidance,\n\n581\n00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:27.690\nwe as Project Managers will tend to do\nanything that we can within our insanely\n\n582\n00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:33.330\nsuper power way which is not really a lot\nbut our insane super powers, to say what?\n\n583\n00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:36.510\nThere's no way we're even touching that,\nwe will treat it like kryptonite and\n\n584\n00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:39.270\nwe will try and\navoid it as much as possible, okay.\n\n585\n00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:47.630\nIn reality, though, right, if the risk is\na low probability but has a high impact.\n\n586\n00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:51.920\nLow probability was actually on the low\nscale on the left-hand side, but\n\n587\n00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.480\nhigh on that horizontal scale.\n\n588\n00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.040\nMore than likely, we're gonna\nactually do transference instead.\n\n589\n00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.970\nNow, Daniel, I've been using this\nterm cuz it's technically the project\n\n590\n00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:02.130\nmanagement term.\n\n591\n00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:06.050\nBut, you're the one that actually\ncame from this field here,\n\n592\n00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:08.850\nwhich is the field of insurance, okay?\n\n593\n00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:13.650\nSo, when we talk about transference, well,\nwhat am I doing in my project is I sit\n\n594\n00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:18.130\nthere and go, look, I have something that\nI know that if it hits my project I'm\n\n595\n00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:23.850\ngonna be toast on this, but the chances\nof it hitting my project, not so great.\n\n596\n00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:26.460\nSomebody actually mentioned\nin our chatroom right,\n\n597\n00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.275\nabout the idea of things like floods and\nstuff like that.\n\n598\n00:34:29.275 --> 00:34:31.090\nWell it could happen.\n\n599\n00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:32.275\nI'm in Florida.\n\n600\n00:34:32.275 --> 00:34:35.060\nFlooding,especially where I live\naround three different rivers,\n\n601\n00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:38.260\nflooding can happen very easily if\nI'm in the middle of a project.\n\n602\n00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.640\nBut I can willingly sit there and\ngo \"look,\n\n603\n00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:47.620\nI still need the project to get\ndone.\" High impact if flood happens,\n\n604\n00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:51.760\nbut we're on this kind of seven year\ncycle, that we've been in a drought, eh,\n\n605\n00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.720\nmaybe it's not gonna happen at all,\nbut what do I do instead?\n\n606\n00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:59.940\nI go to Daniel's former company and go,\nI need to take out a policy for this.\n\n607\n00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:03.777\nOkay, that's not me getting rid\nof the risk I'm transferring it\n\n608\n00:35:03.777 --> 00:35:08.101\ninto a policy that says look,\nI'm guessing this is not gonna happen, but\n\n609\n00:35:08.101 --> 00:35:10.920\nif it does,\nI can now have a pay out from it.\n\n610\n00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.400\nSo, that's the idea of transference and\nbelieve it or\n\n611\n00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:18.170\nnot a lot of our risk planning, okay,\nwe handle it in doing transferring.\n\n612\n00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:19.360\nWhy?\n\n613\n00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.090\nIt does cost a bit, but\n\n614\n00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:24.840\nit really does allow us to get on\nthe project as soon as we can, okay?\n\n615\n00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:28.060\nMitigation, of course,\nis dealing with the risk itself.\n\n616\n00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:32.880\nThe idea of avoidance isn't really\ndealing with the idea that the risk,\n\n617\n00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.220\nwe're just saying we're\njust gonna get around it.\n\n618\n00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.120\nTransference, again,\ndoesn't really get rid of the risk.\n\n619\n00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.500\nMitigation in theory should\nget rid of the risk.\n\n620\n00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.439\nWhy?\nBecause we face it head on, and\n\n621\n00:35:44.439 --> 00:35:47.879\nsay alright, what can we do to\ndeal with the risks that I have?\n\n622\n00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:52.740\nProblem is this takes a longest time, cuz\nyou don't know what factors actually deal\n\n623\n00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:56.650\nwith the risk that happens and you never\ncan actually judge what the overall\n\n624\n00:35:56.650 --> 00:36:00.190\nimpact to that risk is, so even though you\nmay deal with it immediately, you might\n\n625\n00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:04.580\nfind out something that whatever happened\nhere we can restructure something else.\n\n626\n00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:08.930\nYou may found out that your impact of\nchange in this actually affects a deal\n\n627\n00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:10.730\nsomewhere else so you don't know.\n\n628\n00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:12.740\nMitigations are a little bit strange.\n\n629\n00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:15.290\nThey take the longest time,\nbut in theory, they should\n\n630\n00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:18.760\nbe where you're actually handling\nthe risk and you're dealing with it.\n\n631\n00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.440\nOf course, outright accepting it.\n\n632\n00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.000\nSay, well look, risk is gonna happen.\n\n633\n00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.460\nThat's what ends up happening and\nthat's what you do.\n\n634\n00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:27.380\nSo you just go ahead and accept it,\ndeal with it, you pay for it.\n\n635\n00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.590\nThat's what goes on there.\n\n636\n00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:31.830\nNow what if the risk is\nactually something positive?\n\n637\n00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:35.170\nWell again you have three\ndifferent opportunities here, too.\n\n638\n00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:37.080\nBest and foremost,\nwe're going to exploit it.\n\n639\n00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:41.080\nIf this is something good we exploit the\nheck out of it and we go ahead and we go,\n\n640\n00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.560\nlet's jump on this bandwagon.\n\n641\n00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:45.588\nAnd we throw all of our resources\nbehind it and we can do that.\n\n642\n00:36:45.588 --> 00:36:48.570\nIf we believe that even\nthough this is a great thing,\n\n643\n00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:52.980\nwe wanna share this as well to be\nable to spread out the workload\n\n644\n00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:56.910\nas well as actually having to share\npart of the benefits of it, too.\n\n645\n00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:59.720\nAnd then, of course, if we believe that\nthis is something that can turn into\n\n646\n00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:03.080\nsomething else, we're willing to enhance\nit, invest more into it, as well.\n\n647\n00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.200\nSo those are also possibilities, too,\n\n648\n00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.770\nif it's some type of opportunity,\nrisk opportunity.\n\n649\n00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:09.410\nAnd lastly,\n\n650\n00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:13.380\nwe have to talk just briefly about\ncontingency is what we need to do, okay?\n\n651\n00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:17.060\nContingency is not what we like to say,\nright?\n\n652\n00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.930\nIt’s not that we’re dealing with a risk\nbecause we're not because a risk doesn’t\n\n653\n00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:20.790\nactually exist.\n\n654\n00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:24.530\nThis is a probability of any risk\nhappening is what we’re taking a look at.\n\n655\n00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:28.080\nContingency planning is all about\nthe what if is what we're saying here.\n\n656\n00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:28.880\n>> The backup plan.\n\n657\n00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.650\n>> The backup plan exactly good.\n\n658\n00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:35.330\nThe backup plan, what do we think is\nmost likely to happen if it happens,\n\n659\n00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:40.120\nand then we're coming up with\nwhat we might do to deal with it.\n\n660\n00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:44.570\nMost of the time we don't tend to\nworry about contingencies too often,\n\n661\n00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:49.000\nunless the probability is very high or\n\n662\n00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.910\nthe impact is very high, then we start\ndealing with idea of contingencies.\n\n663\n00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:54.770\nIf it's just a normal everyday risk,\n\n664\n00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:57.980\nwe just try to mitigate it as it\ncomes along more than anything else.\n\n665\n00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:01.990\nWe don't tend to deal with contingencies\non a regular day to day, but we do say\n\n666\n00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:06.390\nthough, on these contingency or on these\nbasis here, we're at a high probability or\n\n667\n00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:10.790\na high impact, I need to have a plan\non hand just in case it happens.\n\n668\n00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:14.370\nSo, when you start talking about risk\nmanagement planning, you need to consider\n\n669\n00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:17.400\nall of those different factors that\nwe really did talk about here.\n\n670\n00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:23.420\nAnd when you do so, you will then come up\nwith your entire risk management plan.\n\n671\n00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.370\nLet me see.\nYep, okay,\n\n672\n00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:29.960\nyour entire risk management plan that\nwill help you to actually realize and\n\n673\n00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.800\ngive your organization and\nyour stakeholders an idea that you have at\n\n674\n00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.880\nleast thought about the risks that can\nactually take place in your project.\n\n675\n00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:41.120\nWhen you can't see the risk\nyou're absolutely gonna end up\n\n676\n00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.780\nhaving them hit you in the face.\n\n677\n00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.470\nYou don't know how to deal with them.\n\n678\n00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:46.330\nWell, then that slows\nyour project down again.\n\n679\n00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:48.320\nSomething you don't want to have happen.\n\n680\n00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:52.550\nSo being able to actually manage risk,\na huge part of project management as well.\n\n681\n00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:55.130\n>> Yes, definitely,\nanytime you put together a project,\n\n682\n00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:56.660\nthere's always risks involved.\n\n683\n00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:58.575\nWe have to have a way to deal with those.\n\n684\n00:38:58.575 --> 00:39:03.290\nRonnie, you've done a great job of\nshowing us at least the Project+ way or\n\n685\n00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:05.950\nCompTIAs way of helping\nguide us through that.\n\n686\n00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:08.650\nWe have some sort of actionable\nplan that we can take.\n\n687\n00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:11.290\nAnd we understand the concepts within\nthem, did a great job on that,\n\n688\n00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:12.620\nwe really appreciate you stopping by.\n\n689\n00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:15.920\nThat being said, we have gone over\nour time just a little bit, but\n\n690\n00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.530\nwe're gonna call it a day right here.\n\n691\n00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:20.150\nThanks again for you, Ronnie,\nand thank you for watching.\n\n692\n00:39:20.150

welcome\nto another great episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.312 --> 00:00:17.860\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.520\nAnd in today's episode we are moving\non with our Project+ course.\n\n6\n00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.330\nAnd joining us back in the studio again\ntoday to lend his, well, his expertise and\n\n7\n00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.310\nhis knowledge on that very subject\nis our good friend, Mr. Ronnie Long.\n\n8\n00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.660\nRonnie, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n9\n00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.121\n>> Well thank you having me on the show,\n\n10\n00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:34.399\nas we continue on to take\na look at CompTia's Project+.\n\n11\n00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.071\nWe are now moving into the realm of, well,\n\n12\n00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:41.020\nresource management is what\nwe're taking a look at here.\n\n13\n00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.250\nRemember that, as a project manager it's\nnot really our responsibility to literally\n\n14\n00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.130\nmanage every single resource\nthat's actually out there.\n\n15\n00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.150\nOur responsibility is to come up with a\nplan in which we can actually manage those\n\n16\n00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.070\nresources that we have available.\n\n17\n00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.190\nResources are pretty much\nthe part of our project that\n\n18\n00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.150\nmay get overlooked a lot of times\nbecause assumptions that are made.\n\n19\n00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.060\nSome of the assumptions that's made\nwhen you become a project manager is\n\n20\n00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.250\nyour project team is ready and\nwaiting to go.\n\n21\n00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.090\nEvery resource that you have need\nof is ready and waiting to go.\n\n22\n00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.010\nEverything that you think that you can\nhave ready to have accomplish that project\n\n23\n00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.520\nis actually ready and willing to go.\n\n24\n00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.060\nAnd the reality of that is that\nnone of that may actually exist.\n\n25\n00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.400\nAnd one of the things that you have\nto do then, as a project manager,\n\n26\n00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.310\nis go ahead and begin to think about what\ncan we do to ensure that we come up with\n\n27\n00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.230\nsome type of resource management\nplan at a very high level overview.\n\n28\n00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.350\nWe're not gonna get into\nthe nitty gritty details because\n\n29\n00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.660\nevery single project\nis gonna be different.\n\n30\n00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.868\nIf you're working building construction,\n\n31\n00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:46.360\nit's gonna be different than if I'm\nworking on an IT project, right?\n\n32\n00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.840\nYou need different resources and\n\n33\n00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.130\ndifferent types of people working on\nthose particular types of resources.\n\n34\n00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.170\nIf you're working under water,\nunderground,\n\n35\n00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.820\nversus you're actually building\na sky rise, it's gonna be different.\n\n36\n00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.530\nSo we're not actually getting\ninto the nitty-grittys of exactly\n\n37\n00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.120\nwho needs to be hired and what needs\nto be hired and human resources.\n\n38\n00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.010\nWe're not even going to that point\nwhere I actually explain to Daniel that\n\n39\n00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.640\nhere's what I need and\nhe tells me what type of person I need.\n\n40\n00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.670\nWe're just talking about what\ndo we really need to understand\n\n41\n00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.530\nabout what has to be on our\nproject to at least make it work.\n\n42\n00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.770\nOkay, so this is the 10,000 feet overview\n\n43\n00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.440\nof what we call resource management\nplanning as what we're taking a look at.\n\n44\n00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.470\nSo, when we begin to start planning for\n\n45\n00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.990\nour project and\nnow our resource management planning.\n\n46\n00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.940\nWe need to understand that all those\nthings that I just talked about may not\n\n47\n00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.930\nactually be on hand yet.\n\n48\n00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.510\nAnd that means I need to come up with\nsomething that will help me to be able to\n\n49\n00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.880\nidentify the resources that I need and\nto make sure that I can actually get them\n\n50\n00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.870\nonto the project planning and that's what\nwe're actually going to take a look at.\n\n51\n00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.490\nOkay?\n\n52\n00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.320\nSo let's go ahead and\njump right in, and here it is.\n\n53\n00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.560\nI've got my diagram up so\nthat we can take a look at resource\n\n54\n00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.050\nmanagement planning\ncomponents that we have.\n\n55\n00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.050\nAnd the first.\n\n56\n00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.270\nOops, now that's a little bit unusual.\n\n57\n00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.850\nThe first aspect of this that\nwe're gonna take a look at then\n\n58\n00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.300\nis gonna be up here where it says,\nidentify existing resource availability.\n\n59\n00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.310\nNow, when we start to talk about\nsomething like that, right?\n\n60\n00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.140\nThe very fact is, as like what we said,\nyou can try and assume that\n\n61\n00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.760\nall this is gonna be ready by the time\nthat your project actually begins.\n\n62\n00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.410\nBut what you need to do is go ahead and\nstart planning out and figuring out\n\n63\n00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.090\nwhether or not that resource is in\nexistence right now and can you get it?\n\n64\n00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.010\nOkay, and that is a key thing, right?\n\n65\n00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.920\nIf you're gonna start scheduling and start\ntrying to figure out how your project is\n\n66\n00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.320\ngonna work, you need to make sure\nthat you have on hand what you need.\n\n67\n00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.180\nAnd the first one that we always\ntalk about is just human resources.\n\n68\n00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.330\nThis one is, by far,\nthe one that can be very difficult for\n\n69\n00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.070\nyou to get or very easy, depending on\nwhere you are located in the world.\n\n70\n00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.300\nAnd it's easy enough to give\nus a real-world example.\n\n71\n00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.020\nWe're here in Gainesville, Florida and\nas we're here creating more and\n\n72\n00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.170\nmore shows, we're starting to find\nout from our members that hey,\n\n73\n00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.260\nhere's the shows that they want us to do.\n\n74\n00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.660\nWell I hate to say it,\nas brilliant as Daniel and\n\n75\n00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.995\nI really are, and I'm kinda joking on\nthat to a point, but Daniel's brilliant.\n\n76\n00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:24.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But as brilliant as he is,\n\n77\n00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.880\nthere are some topics that he's\nnot very comfortable with.\n\n78\n00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.210\nThere's a ton of topics\nI'm not comfortable with.\n\n79\n00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.390\nWe're trying to find out best\nsubject matter experts that we can\n\n80\n00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.440\nbring on the show.\n\n81\n00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.930\nDaniel's actually got one coming up\non Python, which is gonna be great.\n\n82\n00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.990\nThat we can find but sometimes you might\nfind out in the area that you live in\n\n83\n00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.580\nthose experts are few and far in\nbetween and so you'd have to be able to\n\n84\n00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.820\nmove outside of that particular\ncomfort zone of where you are.\n\n85\n00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.250\nBut if we were maybe in\na larger metropolitan area,\n\n86\n00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.904\nin a larger city where those people did\nreally exist and tend to work towards,\n\n87\n00:04:56.904 --> 00:05:00.545\nit might be a lot easier for us to get\nthose types of human resources, right?\n\n88\n00:05:00.545 --> 00:05:01.060\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n89\n00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.920\n>> So, availability is really important if\nwe're gonna start to actually trying to\n\n90\n00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.330\nplan out for human resources, right?\n\n91\n00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.090\n>> Yeah definitely, the larger\nthe population the more likely it is that\n\n92\n00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.140\nyou're gonna be able to find someone\nwith the skill sets necessary for\n\n93\n00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.380\nyou to lean on their expertise.\n\n94\n00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.620\nThat's just kind of statistical\nanalysis right there in your face.\n\n95\n00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.980\nNot much you can do about that.\n\n96\n00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.820\nWhen you go to a place where\nthere aren't very many people,\n\n97\n00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.800\nwell then the probability runs low that\nyou're gonna find that person that you\n\n98\n00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.510\nneed to be that expert for your project.\n\n99\n00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.030\nBut they are a great, great resource.\n\n100\n00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.465\nAnd probably one of the ones you\nwant to give emphasis to, right?\n\n101\n00:05:38.465 --> 00:05:40.310\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You wanna make sure that you have\n\n102\n00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.080\nexperts in this field\nguiding your decisions\n\n103\n00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.850\nin the project cuz it's really gonna\nhelp the project move forward.\n\n104\n00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.370\n>> Yeah, and finding them available\nat the right time is also the key.\n\n105\n00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.960\nDon't just say,\n\n106\n00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.490\nhey, I need you right now unless you\nreally need the person right now.\n\n107\n00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.995\nYou may need to go out and plan out with\nthem that what we'd like to do is actually\n\n108\n00:05:56.995 --> 00:06:01.110\nget you on our project for,\nbeginning in July, okay.\n\n109\n00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.670\nAnd even though right now it's March, and\nthe time that we're actually recording\n\n110\n00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.070\nthis episode, we may go ahead and say,\nLook, we'd love to get you on in July.\n\n111\n00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.150\nWe're just trying to figure out\nyour availability right now.\n\n112\n00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.590\nAnd that is part of understanding\nthat the person or the expert or\n\n113\n00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.140\nwhoever you're talking about\nin terms of human resources.\n\n114\n00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.240\nWhat if they're available now, but\nthey're not available in July?\n\n115\n00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.700\nSo trying to figure that out is a big\npart of planning for human resources, is\n\n116\n00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.160\nscheduling and coordinating, and figuring\nout how that stuff is gonna get there.\n\n117\n00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.810\nAre they the right expert?\n\n118\n00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:39.660\nSometimes we can get a little bit\nconfused in this sense that we believe,\n\n119\n00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.040\nwe know exactly what expert\nwe think that we need, and\n\n120\n00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.670\nthen you start talking to them and\nyou realize something.\n\n121\n00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.130\nThat's not the expert that you need, and\nthen you have to go to someone else and\n\n122\n00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.850\nthat does happen sometimes.\n\n123\n00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.510\nWhen you are actually trying\nto build something you go,\n\n124\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.660\nhere's the expert that I need.\n\n125\n00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.160\nAnd then you talk to them on the phone for\n\n126\n00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.240\na half an hour and they kinda go,\nyeah, you don't need me.\n\n127\n00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.230\nYou need this type of person.\n\n128\n00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:06.270\nAnd that really did happen to use here at\nITProTV Studios is that we've had, and\n\n129\n00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.900\nI don't wanna say issues, but we thought\nthat what we needed is this type of expert\n\n130\n00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.460\nto help us out in making sure\nthat what we're doing looks good,\n\n131\n00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.280\nsounds good, does everything that we need.\n\n132\n00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.980\nAnd so, we essentially want to look for\nthat particular type of expert.\n\n133\n00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.300\nWell, it actually took one of those\nexperts to say, what you're really looking\n\n134\n00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.600\nfor though, because you actually have a\nlot of different systems that have to work\n\n135\n00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.500\ntogether is what, is you're looking for\nan inauguration expert,\n\n136\n00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.680\nsomeone that can actually show you\nhow all that stuff comes together and\n\n137\n00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.960\nthat was the last thing that\nwe had really thought about.\n\n138\n00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.240\nAnd so where does that comes from, it\ndoesn't come from a lack of trying, right?\n\n139\n00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.237\nIt comes from at that point a lack\nof experience of saying look,\n\n140\n00:07:45.237 --> 00:07:48.462\nhere's this system, here's this system,\nhere's this system,\n\n141\n00:07:48.462 --> 00:07:51.649\nwe knew about those systems,\nwe even knew how those systems work.\n\n142\n00:07:51.649 --> 00:07:53.456\nBut to make them work in concert,\n\n143\n00:07:53.456 --> 00:07:57.526\nwe needed someone that was actually\nan integration expert that could say,\n\n144\n00:07:57.526 --> 00:08:00.578\nhere's how these things\nshould work together, okay?\n\n145\n00:08:00.578 --> 00:08:01.083\nAnd so,\n\n146\n00:08:01.083 --> 00:08:05.648\nyou may actually find yourself having\nto deal with that situation as well.\n\n147\n00:08:05.648 --> 00:08:09.837\nSo as far as human resources go, we need\nto make sure that those type of resources\n\n148\n00:08:09.837 --> 00:08:12.774\nare available,\nthe person with the right expertise and\n\n149\n00:08:12.774 --> 00:08:16.340\nthe person that has the available\ntime on their schedule.\n\n150\n00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:20.060\nIf not, what are you willing to do\nto get them on the schedule as well?\n\n151\n00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.050\nIs there anything you can do?\n\n152\n00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.366\nYou might find out there's nothing you\ncan do, and you just need another subject\n\n153\n00:08:24.366 --> 00:08:26.631\nmatter expert or\nsomebody else to come in and help you.\n\n154\n00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:30.880\nBut it may be that you just need another\nhand, so it's not really a big deal.\n\n155\n00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.400\nBut you gotta figure out,\nin terms of human resources,\n\n156\n00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.500\nwhat is the availability that you have?\n\n157\n00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.910\nDo you need more people?\n\n158\n00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:41.350\nWhat if you realize that for 10 weeks\nof your project you need an average\n\n159\n00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:46.180\nof 200 workers on all 10 weeks and\nyou have to be able to have that.\n\n160\n00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.480\nYou can't go a day without\nthose 200 workers.\n\n161\n00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.970\nSo you may find out that there's no way.\n\n162\n00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.258\nIn the area that you live in, you might be\nable to get 100 on any one given day, but\n\n163\n00:08:56.258 --> 00:08:58.050\nyou needed 200 to make it work.\n\n164\n00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.110\nWell, now you start having\nsome conundrum issues.\n\n165\n00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.380\nSo dealing with human\nresources is a big issue.\n\n166\n00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.030\nUnderstanding that this is what\nyou need is also another one, and\n\n167\n00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.560\ntheir availability.\n\n168\n00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.020\nThe other one, of course,\ncomes down to things like equipment.\n\n169\n00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:16.900\nNow it's nice when you end up working for\na company that owns all of\n\n170\n00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:21.510\nthe equipment that you're ever gonna\nneed for a construction project.\n\n171\n00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.190\nIf they own it and\nyou can get a hold of it, that's great.\n\n172\n00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:29.610\nBut Daniel's worked in\nconstruction before, and Daniel,\n\n173\n00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.100\nthere isn't a possibility that two\nseparate construction teams might need\n\n174\n00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.480\nthat same piece of equipment is there?\n\n175\n00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.710\n>> It does happen from time to time, and\nthen everybody's funny, hey, I need that\n\n176\n00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:43.510\nexcavator over here to dig a hole so that\nwe can start pouring concrete or whatever.\n\n177\n00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:45.410\nAnd then the other guy says, well,\nwe're trying to lay pipe over here.\n\n178\n00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:46.750\nWe need that excavator.\n\n179\n00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:50.620\nSo yes, there definitely can be\na conflict for the equipment.\n\n180\n00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.140\nSo trying to figure out, well,\nis that going to happen?\n\n181\n00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.160\nShould I get two excavators\ninstead of one, or\n\n182\n00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.220\nshould I just send a crew of laborers\nto dig holes manually with shovels for\n\n183\n00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.700\nthe pipe laying team and\nthrow the excavator over here?\n\n184\n00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.200\nThat's the kind of things\nyou gotta remember.\n\n185\n00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.752\nDo I even have the laborers\nto go over there?\n\n186\n00:10:08.752 --> 00:10:13.080\nAgain, going back to that\nhuman element of resources.\n\n187\n00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.600\nIt's hard to plan for that.\n\n188\n00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.400\nBut as you grow in experience and you lean\non people like subject matter experts,\n\n189\n00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.850\nbringing them in, they're gonna help\nyou identify those problems and\n\n190\n00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:25.780\nwhere you might need more equipment, less\nequipment, and reallocating equipment.\n\n191\n00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.510\nBut we all need equipment,\n\n192\n00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.330\notherwise we're not gonna get very\nfar when it comes to a project.\n\n193\n00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.460\n>> Right, so\nwe need to be able to identify first and\n\n194\n00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.820\nforemost what equipment we do need, and\n\n195\n00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:39.360\nthen what is the lead time to get that\nequipment to where we need to go as well.\n\n196\n00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.890\nThe very fact that I say\nthat I need that excavator.\n\n197\n00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:44.680\nI might need it on Monday, but\n\n198\n00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.020\nwhat if that excavator's\nactually off-site somewhere.\n\n199\n00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.180\nAnd it doesn't matter how\nmuch that they say look,\n\n200\n00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.190\nwe're gonna get done by the end\nof the day but we can't.\n\n201\n00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:56.700\nIn other words, we don't have the\ntransport to get it there until Wednesday.\n\n202\n00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.880\nWell, now this is where you have to start\nestablishing how much lead time do I need\n\n203\n00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.810\nto give before I can do that, or\ndo I need to look for someone else?\n\n204\n00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:07.280\nDo I need to go and look for\nrenting equipment and\n\n205\n00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.240\nis that equipment rental available for\nus too?\n\n206\n00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.521\nSo when you start talking\nabout planning for resources,\n\n207\n00:11:13.521 --> 00:11:17.961\nrealize that part of that resource\nmanagement plan is really making sure that\n\n208\n00:11:17.961 --> 00:11:21.442\nit's available on the day that\nwe need it and when we need it,\n\n209\n00:11:21.442 --> 00:11:25.440\nnot just that I can call and go,\nyeah, they've got one right now.\n\n210\n00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.188\nMy plan doesn't start or my project\ndoesn't start for another three months,\n\n211\n00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:30.584\nand I can't just tell them.\n\n212\n00:11:30.584 --> 00:11:33.340\nAnd then sometimes you might be able to,\nbut I need to schedule it for this day,\n\n213\n00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.900\nbut how do you know until that\npoint it's actually ready\n\n214\n00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:40.170\nthat you're gonna be ready for\nit when it's available as well?\n\n215\n00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:43.540\nSo that's where you are managing now for\ncontingencies and\n\n216\n00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.820\nthings like that to happen,\nto actually think about as well.\n\n217\n00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.730\nThe other one that we also wanna mention,\nof course,\n\n218\n00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:54.000\nis just regular everyday\nmaterials we call consumables too.\n\n219\n00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.420\nConsumables and stuff like this are part\nof something that we don't think about,\n\n220\n00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.400\nbecause, once again,\nwhen we actually do end up working for\n\n221\n00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.820\na company that has fairly\nmonster-size resources on hand,\n\n222\n00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.480\nwe simply assume that those\nresources are available.\n\n223\n00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.212\nBut remember that supplies that\nwe tend to deal with each and\n\n224\n00:12:13.212 --> 00:12:18.080\nevery day may not actually be as\navailable as we think that they are.\n\n225\n00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.590\nAnd so we need to make sure that\neither they are available or\n\n226\n00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.750\nthat we need to do something with it.\n\n227\n00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:27.790\nSo the idea here that I've put is just\nregular supplies as you start thinking\n\n228\n00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.300\nabout it, things that you\njust don't think about doing.\n\n229\n00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.590\nSo let's say that we go back\nto the idea of the equipment.\n\n230\n00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.585\nEven if I have that equipment\non hand let's say for\n\n231\n00:12:35.585 --> 00:12:39.660\nten days, the maintenance schedule says\nthat after every ten hours of use,\n\n232\n00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.490\nit's supposed to go through and\nwe're supposed to grease it up,\n\n233\n00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.330\nwe're supposed to do all the things\nthat we need to do to maintain it.\n\n234\n00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.900\nWe check every fitting,\nwe do all that stuff.\n\n235\n00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:51.320\nAnd then I'm supposed to also check\nin the hydraulic leak fluids and\n\n236\n00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.185\nwhatever it might be.\n\n237\n00:12:52.185 --> 00:12:57.730\nWell, I might realize that I don't have\nany of that stuff after the ten hours.\n\n238\n00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.590\nWell, what am I supposed to do?\n\n239\n00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.290\nSo you need to make sure that if\nyou do things like the equipment\n\n240\n00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:04.940\nthat you have all the stuff that's needed.\n\n241\n00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.855\nIf it tells you ten hours\nthere's a maintenance check and\n\n242\n00:13:07.855 --> 00:13:10.891\nthere's actually a scheduled downtime for\nthat thing, so\n\n243\n00:13:10.891 --> 00:13:14.899\nthat you can actually do all the other\nmaintenance things that need to be done,\n\n244\n00:13:14.899 --> 00:13:18.270\nit means you need to have all that\nstuff on hand ready to go to do it.\n\n245\n00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.634\nTo actually come to that point and\n\n246\n00:13:19.634 --> 00:13:22.313\nnot have it ready, that's actually\ngonna be bad for you as well,\n\n247\n00:13:22.313 --> 00:13:26.160\nbecause that equipment then can have\nfailures that you're not accounting for.\n\n248\n00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.110\nAnd then when it comes out to addressing\nthis, well, we ran it a little bit\n\n249\n00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.560\nlonger than we were supposed to because\nwe didn't have everything ready.\n\n250\n00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.890\nAnd they're gonna blame you for that.\n\n251\n00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:37.540\nSo just kinda realize that understanding\nmaterials are also there as well.\n\n252\n00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:39.990\nAnd of course, any other resources.\n\n253\n00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:43.550\nIt says all resources go into\na resource requirement document.\n\n254\n00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.810\nAnd that is the key so\nthat we know what needs to be on hand.\n\n255\n00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.566\nWe're not trying to list every\nsingle little sheet of paper,\n\n256\n00:13:50.566 --> 00:13:51.520\neven though you can.\n\n257\n00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:56.538\nBut what we're trying to say is if you're\nplanning this, go ahead and make your list\n\n258\n00:13:56.538 --> 00:14:02.190\nof what you absolutely believe that you'll\nneed right there as your project begins.\n\n259\n00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.350\nIt's a hard fact to begin a project and\n\n260\n00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:07.720\nthen realize,\nI forgot that we needed this too.\n\n261\n00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.360\nAnd now if you're actually on a small\nproject team, you send somebody\n\n262\n00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.190\nout to go and get this part and\nyou don't have a clue how long it will go.\n\n263\n00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.070\nAnd I remember being on\na small project like this,\n\n264\n00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.560\nwhere we were repairing the rear\nend of a dump truck in Miami.\n\n265\n00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.845\nAnd it's not that it was in Miami\nthat was actually the problem.\n\n266\n00:14:24.845 --> 00:14:30.020\nIt's the problem that where we ended up is\na very highly Spanish-speaking area and\n\n267\n00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.850\nI spoke no Spanish at all.\n\n268\n00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.060\nAnd yet I had to go and\n\n269\n00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:38.170\nget this particular threaded nut\nthat had that one angle on it.\n\n270\n00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:42.430\nAnd now I was having to translate\nthat this is what I needed and\n\n271\n00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:46.510\nthey sent me all across the city and\nI had to get the instructions\n\n272\n00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:50.360\njust about in Spanish, where I took\na map and essentially showed them.\n\n273\n00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:54.130\nAnd all I was sent out for\nwas this nut, and\n\n274\n00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.380\nit just seemed like it\nshould be a 20-minute job.\n\n275\n00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.630\nYou go out, you go to a hardware store,\nyou pick that nut up, you bring it back,\n\n276\n00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.610\nand you're ready to go.\n\n277\n00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.730\nI was gone for five hours,\nis what I was gone for.\n\n278\n00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:09.240\nAnd so you can imagine that if you\ndon't have all the equipment there,\n\n279\n00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.700\nyou now have to go and search for it.\n\n280\n00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.470\nIt delays the entire project as well.\n\n281\n00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:17.986\nNow the last couple of things we really\nwanna talk about it also this to.\n\n282\n00:15:17.986 --> 00:15:20.993\nNow I didn't actually\nover emphasize at all,\n\n283\n00:15:20.993 --> 00:15:24.320\nbecause we're not really\nin the game of training.\n\n284\n00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.536\nBut part of our management plan, though,\nis to understand that whoever we get on\n\n285\n00:15:28.536 --> 00:15:32.815\nour project, if there is some specialty\nrequirement, we may need to send them for\n\n286\n00:15:32.815 --> 00:15:34.648\ntraining as well.\n\n287\n00:15:34.648 --> 00:15:37.960\nSo we might have to identify\ntraining needs or, again,\n\n288\n00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.350\noutsourcing if we don't have\nenough time to do the training.\n\n289\n00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:45.430\nSo you need to actually plan for that in\nterms of your resource management as well.\n\n290\n00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.170\nAre you actually gonna\ntake the time to do so, or\n\n291\n00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.120\nare you actually just gonna outsource it?\n\n292\n00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:53.790\nAnd it just depends on what\nis your big constraint there.\n\n293\n00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:57.500\nIf you're still in the planning stages and\nyou go, no, I actually went ahead and\n\n294\n00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.550\nset this up, that I knew that\nwe would need to train on this.\n\n295\n00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:02.868\nYou go ahead and you set that up\nbefore the project ever begins.\n\n296\n00:16:02.868 --> 00:16:06.785\nYou tell your team, here's two weeks of\ntraining you're gonna have to go through\n\n297\n00:16:06.785 --> 00:16:08.618\nto make sure that we can get this done.\n\n298\n00:16:08.618 --> 00:16:10.218\nWell, then you go ahead and\nyou set that up.\n\n299\n00:16:10.218 --> 00:16:11.778\nOr, and you may find out.\n\n300\n00:16:11.778 --> 00:16:14.030\nHere's a group of experts we can get in.\n\n301\n00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.880\nThe cost is just about the same.\n\n302\n00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.360\nBut these guys have done it before,\n\n303\n00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.610\nthey're not learning it right after\nthe training and trying to figure it out.\n\n304\n00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:22.730\nIt just depends on what you also need.\n\n305\n00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:26.970\nAnd of course, making sure that they have\na proper schedule is what we're taking\n\n306\n00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:28.140\na look at here.\n\n307\n00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:33.160\nSo when you start to see stuff like this,\nit is in the time when\n\n308\n00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.320\nyou're not really spending any\nmoney at all, and that's the key.\n\n309\n00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.610\nThat you're actually\nplanning this stuff out,\n\n310\n00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:42.740\nyou're saying that you are considering\nthe factors that go into\n\n311\n00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.900\nmanaging those different resources,\nto help you out.\n\n312\n00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:50.200\nNow let's go back to the human\nresources just briefly here.\n\n313\n00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.930\nI wanted to go through all that, and then\nwe'll take a look at a couple of specifics\n\n314\n00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.510\nhere, so that we can understand things,\nespecially about human resources.\n\n315\n00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.160\nDaniel if you and\nI ended up working on a project, and\n\n316\n00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:05.000\nlet's say that we took a look at it and\nwe thought, of course we can do that.\n\n317\n00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.530\nAnd then I said all right Daniel,\n\n318\n00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.090\nhow many people do you think\nit would take to do that?\n\n319\n00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:11.500\nAnd all the sudden Daniel\njust looked at me and went?\n\n320\n00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:18.020\nI didn't really ever think about\nthe number of people that it would take.\n\n321\n00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.850\nWell that means that we may not\nhave actually considered all that\n\n322\n00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.560\nwe probably needed to consider.\n\n323\n00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.460\nBut that doesn't mean\nyou're in danger right?\n\n324\n00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.050\nIt means that there are tools\nout there that are available\n\n325\n00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:30.060\nto help you to figure stuff like this out,\nokay.\n\n326\n00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.190\nSo, one of those tools\nthat we can actually use,\n\n327\n00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.480\nlet me see if I can find it here.\n\n328\n00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:39.030\nBring it up on monitor, there it goes,\nlet me see, let me zoom out for a moment.\n\n329\n00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.550\nIs what we call a RAM, okay.\n\n330\n00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:46.720\nNow, when we start talking about\nthe idea of a RAM, it stands for\n\n331\n00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.860\nresponsibility and\nassignment matrix is what it stands for.\n\n332\n00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.249\nAnd I tried to go ahead and\nenlarge the font so\n\n333\n00:17:53.249 --> 00:17:56.294\nthat we can see it just a little\nbit easier, there we go.\n\n334\n00:17:56.294 --> 00:18:01.820\nIs that you may come up with\nsomething like this for your project.\n\n335\n00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.170\nI took a small project here.\n\n336\n00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.860\nLet's say that Daniel and\nI came up with the idea that\n\n337\n00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.630\nwe were gonna actually work on\na website development project.\n\n338\n00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:14.480\nOkay, but I don't have a clue\nhow many people I might need,\n\n339\n00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.200\nor whatever it might do, okay.\n\n340\n00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.100\nSo what I did is I come up with\na work breakdown structure over here.\n\n341\n00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:25.140\nSo notice that I have seven or\neight different work packages.\n\n342\n00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.200\nSeven, okay,\nseven different work packages.\n\n343\n00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.270\nAnd I realized for this web\ndevelopment project, it was full long.\n\n344\n00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:35.310\nSo I know that I need\nsomebody in marketing, or\n\n345\n00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:37.070\nI need resources in marketing.\n\n346\n00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:38.460\nI need some designers.\n\n347\n00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:41.940\nI need somebody to test the server,\nprogrammers,\n\n348\n00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:46.050\na user interface tester,\nhere, and even a copywriter.\n\n349\n00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:51.220\nLet's say I know that these are the skills\nthat I need on my development team, okay.\n\n350\n00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:55.550\nNow the problem that I have is, I don't\nknow how many of those that I need.\n\n351\n00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:57.170\nSo I may just assume one.\n\n352\n00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:58.800\nAnd then I realize something.\n\n353\n00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.320\nI need more than that.\n\n354\n00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.640\nSo what you do is you take a look at each\nof your work breakdown structure packages.\n\n355\n00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.150\nIn other words, your work packages,\nand you try and\n\n356\n00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:12.510\nsay, here's how many hours or whatever\nit is, that needs to accomplish that.\n\n357\n00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.740\nAnd at that point the key here is this, so\n\n358\n00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.520\nthat you can see it as you\nstart planning this out.\n\n359\n00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.360\nAnd what we want to do is we want to\nuse this grid that we've made here, and\n\n360\n00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:26.400\nwe want the number of resources that we\nbelieve we're gonna need per work package.\n\n361\n00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.450\nSo it might be on this first work package\nhere that we are really trying to set up\n\n362\n00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:31.280\nthe actual server.\n\n363\n00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.880\nAnd so let's say that I know that I need\none person to work on the server, okay.\n\n364\n00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.200\nAnd then at that point that might be all.\n\n365\n00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.860\nSo in that work package, it may just\nbe one person, okay, to set that up.\n\n366\n00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.290\nBut then as we continue on,\n\n367\n00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:49.240\nI may realize that this particular\ndesigner is, I may need,\n\n368\n00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:54.500\nlet's say, two different designers here\nto work along with somebody in marketing.\n\n369\n00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:59.220\nAnd then also, in copyrighting\nat that particular point, okay.\n\n370\n00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.880\nSo, now when you start to\ntake a look at your project,\n\n371\n00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.130\nnotice what's starting to happen.\n\n372\n00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:09.890\nI can start adding up how many resources\ndo I really need on my project.\n\n373\n00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.280\nAnd at this point, it's human resources.\n\n374\n00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:16.210\nYou can continue to do this on with\nother work materials that you have.\n\n375\n00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:21.241\nBut you're essentially just\ngoing down through here and\n\n376\n00:20:21.241 --> 00:20:25.957\nyou're starting to realize\nthat you might need three\n\n377\n00:20:25.957 --> 00:20:30.586\nprogrammers here and\nthen a user interface tester.\n\n378\n00:20:30.586 --> 00:20:33.220\nAnd let's say that we need\nto test a server again.\n\n379\n00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.930\nThat letter q's getting in the way.\n\n380\n00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.540\nAnd so now you start adding it up.\n\n381\n00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:40.950\nAt the end of your project,\nyou have a general scope.\n\n382\n00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:43.700\nI'm not telling you it's exact,\nbut you have at least a general\n\n383\n00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:48.400\nidea that you're gonna need 15 people at\nsome point if you count up all of these.\n\n384\n00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.980\nAnd some of them you'll reuse again, but\nthat way you can at least see as far\n\n385\n00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:57.910\nas responsibilities go, how many resources\nthat you will need on your project.\n\n386\n00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.070\nSo, it's a great beginning, and\nI'm not saying it's anything else.\n\n387\n00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:03.900\nBut, it's a great beginning for\nyou, though,\n\n388\n00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:09.060\nto be able to plan out the resources\nthat you will need on your project.\n\n389\n00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.240\nSo, a starting point,\nit's not really anything else,\n\n390\n00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.790\nto give you detailed analysis.\n\n391\n00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:16.440\n>> It just keeps you from throwing out the\nwild guess of, how many people is it gonna\n\n392\n00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.360\ntake for us to build this website Well,\nit could be 30 people and\n\n393\n00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:25.210\nobviously from looking this, generally\nthat would probably be way too much.\n\n394\n00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.540\nBut if I said five that\nwould be way too little.\n\n395\n00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:31.990\nIf you don't have a good idea of where to\nbegin, using something like this is going\n\n396\n00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.990\nto help you get that,\nlike Ronnie said, that starting point.\n\n397\n00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:38.890\nIt's a good place to start, and\nthen you can adjust as necessary.\n\n398\n00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.940\nRonnie, is there any other way that\nwe can accomplish the same goal?\n\n399\n00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:45.760\n>> There really is, and this is actually\nonce you get into specifics, to actually\n\n400\n00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.190\nfigure out how many you're going to need,\nmaybe for a single work package as well.\n\n401\n00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:54.370\nAnd there's something that we can actually\ndo that we call a RACI or a RACI or\n\n402\n00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:56.630\nwhatever you want to call it and\nthis stands for,\n\n403\n00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:00.080\nlike it says down here in my legend,\non the lower left-hand-corner.\n\n404\n00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:04.890\nResponsible, Accountable,\nConsult and Inform, okay.\n\n405\n00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.300\nSo when I have different people now,\n\n406\n00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:12.380\nand let's say that here is my website\nproject development team for right now.\n\n407\n00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:16.140\nAaron, Rob, Tyler, Thomas, and\nAngie, and they're actually there.\n\n408\n00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:20.980\nAnd here are the actual different work\npackages that I might have going on.\n\n409\n00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.360\nWell, what I can do,\nis now I can actually start to say,\n\n410\n00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.780\nall right,\nwhat work needs to be assigned here?\n\n411\n00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.850\nAnd I can give a very generic term,\nright, is what I can do.\n\n412\n00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.290\nSo R, of course, stands for responsible.\n\n413\n00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:36.720\nThe one who actually is going\nto do the work that we need.\n\n414\n00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.810\nAnd A is the one who actually signs\noff on the work, the accountable here.\n\n415\n00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:43.530\nThe C on consulting is\nthe one who has input,\n\n416\n00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:47.310\nmaybe on making sure that that work\nis done the way that it needs to.\n\n417\n00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:50.750\nAnd, of course, the I is to inform and\nthis is the person that needs to be\n\n418\n00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:55.380\ninformed at the end of\nthe package that we have.\n\n419\n00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.560\nSo we might actually end up finding out\nsuch as the SEO and marketing list,\n\n420\n00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:03.770\nsay that Erin is actually responsible\nthen for that particular package.\n\n421\n00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:06.930\nAnd then, once we have that,\nat this point,\n\n422\n00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:10.560\nErin watch his finished with the SEO and\nthe marketing of this site.\n\n423\n00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.100\nWe may say that, hey,\nat this point, the accountability\n\n424\n00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.610\nshe's supposed to report to Rob,\nthis is what's gonna happen.\n\n425\n00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:22.300\nAnd then Thomas is actually going\nto be the consultant here, and\n\n426\n00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:27.410\nthen in the end here once\nthe work is about to be performed\n\n427\n00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.205\nAngie is actually suppose\nto be informed here.\n\n428\n00:23:32.205 --> 00:23:36.790\nYu're trying to figure out, okay so in\nthis work package of marketing and SEO, or\n\n429\n00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:39.000\nwhatever the job role,\nis here's what has to happen.\n\n430\n00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.650\nErin's goes to be responsible for\ndoing the work.\n\n431\n00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:44.540\nAngie is going to be told when\nthe work is actually going to be done.\n\n432\n00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.410\nRob going to be told when it's finished.\n\n433\n00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:49.340\nThomas is the one that Erin consults.\n\n434\n00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.180\nWell this again,\nis planning your resources.\n\n435\n00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:55.490\nSo, Erin doesn't say, well Daniel,\nwho am I suppose to ask about this?\n\n436\n00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.494\nAnd Daniel's going, maybe, I don't know.\n\n437\n00:23:59.494 --> 00:24:02.945\nIn the end, he can now flip over\nto something like this and say,\n\n438\n00:24:02.945 --> 00:24:05.746\nwell, from what I see is\nthat you are supposed to let\n\n439\n00:24:05.746 --> 00:24:10.006\nRob know when you're done with work,\nbut if you need help, consult Thomas.\n\n440\n00:24:10.006 --> 00:24:13.828\nAnd so it makes it easier in any\nof these for you to go down and\n\n441\n00:24:13.828 --> 00:24:17.970\nmake it even a little bit more manageable,\nand this helps who?\n\n442\n00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:21.220\nIt helps the resource out,\nthe human resource, they go,\n\n443\n00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.600\nwhatever resource it is,\nwhere it's supposed to go and\n\n444\n00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:27.790\nwhat it's supposed to do, and\nalso lets them know what is the action?\n\n445\n00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:31.170\nWhat is the plan that's gonna happen\nwhen you start seeing a matrix like\n\n446\n00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:32.480\nthis as well?\n\n447\n00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.150\nSo understanding that this\nstuff can really help you out.\n\n448\n00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:39.630\nEspecially when you're not exactly sure\nabout a package that needs to be done.\n\n449\n00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:42.870\nYou go and consult and\nthen you start making this work out here.\n\n450\n00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:45.890\nAnd that way you as a project manager,\nyou're not just guessing.\n\n451\n00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:50.140\nI think Aaron was supposed to tell\nso-and-so, you know, who knows.\n\n452\n00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.470\nBut you can now should go and\nflip through there and\n\n453\n00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:55.650\nfigure it out very easily,\npart of actually understanding management.\n\n454\n00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.600\nLast thing that I wanna say\nabout the idea of, especially\n\n455\n00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.390\nof human resource management, is that you\ndon't have to get as detailed as I did,\n\n456\n00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:05.830\nwhich is to list actual names of people.\n\n457\n00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:09.770\nYou can, but overall though what we're\nreally looking for is some job role,\n\n458\n00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:11.090\nsome job title.\n\n459\n00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:14.430\nAnd that way you can switch them on and\noff whoever you want to.\n\n460\n00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.140\nIn a small organization,\nyou'll probably list them by name.\n\n461\n00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:20.090\nThe reason why is I remember the names a\nlot easier than I remember what their job\n\n462\n00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:23.690\ntitles so, but in a larger organization\n\n463\n00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:27.840\nbeing able to actually say this is who you\nreport to and here's their job title, it's\n\n464\n00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.850\nprobably going to be a lot easier than\nyou trying to memorize everybody’s named.\n\n465\n00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:33.400\nIs it a good thing to do, sure.\n\n466\n00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.610\nDo you have the time to do it?\n\n467\n00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:36.030\nYou may, you may not.\n\n468\n00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:39.890\nBut overall though,\nyou don’t have to get super specific then.\n\n469\n00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.060\nI just did because it was\na fairly small project.\n\n470\n00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.660\nBut just kind of realize\nthat human resource planning\n\n471\n00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:48.080\nis a big part of all sets\nof things that we do.\n\n472\n00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.110\nWhen we actually now have\nto start figuring out\n\n473\n00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:51.710\nhow many people are working\non our project.\n\n474\n00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.980\nWhat are their jobs and\ntheir responsibilities?\n\n475\n00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.530\nWe can work it out in this way.\n\n476\n00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:56.830\n>> Ronnie I really like those tools.\n\n477\n00:25:56.830 --> 00:26:00.230\nThey are very, very valuable, especially\nlike when you said we don't have\n\n478\n00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:04.450\na great idea of where or how to start or\nhow to start moving our people around and\n\n479\n00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:08.390\nallocating those resources in places where\nthey may be needed or may not be needed.\n\n480\n00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:12.140\nThey just give us at least some idea,\na start that we can tighten up later.\n\n481\n00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.470\nThis is always in flux, we can always\nchange these things as we see and\n\n482\n00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.830\nas we need, as we go through our project.\n\n483\n00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:20.250\nAnd Ronnie, you did a great job.\n\n484\n00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:24.750\nThis is something I will actually, I think\neveryone will use regardless of whether or\n\n485\n00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:25.781\nnot they are taking Project +.\n\n486\n00:26:25.781 --> 00:26:26.438\nIt's great tools.\n\n487\n00:26:26.438 --> 00:26:28.392\nThank you so much for stopping by and\n\n488\n00:26:28.392 --> 00:26:31.520\nfilling our heads full of\ngreat Project + knowledge.\n\n489\n00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.180\nHopefully you guys got a lot out of that.\n\n490\n00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:36.650\nThat being said though, we have come to\nthe end of yet another wonderful episode.\n\n491\n00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:38.080\nAgain, hopefully you got a lot out of it.\n\n492\n00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.692\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off though from IT Pro TV.\n\n493\n00:26:40.692 --> 00:26:41.911\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n494\n00:26:41.911 --> 00:26:42.650\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n495\n00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.446\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n496\n00:26:44.446 --> 00:26:52.630\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n",

ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:19.678\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.678 --> 00:00:22.960\nwell we're continuing on\nwith our Project+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.570\nJoining us back in the studio\ntoday to lend his expertise\n\n6\n00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.830\non that very topic is our good friend and\nmentor Mister Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.270\nRonnie welcome back to the show Sir.\n\n8\n00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:30.970\n>> Well thank you for\n\n9\n00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.733\nhaving me back on the show as we\ncontinue on taking CompTIAs Project+.\n\n10\n00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:40.162\nAnd today we're delving in to the realm\nof what we call quality control or\n\n11\n00:00:40.162 --> 00:00:41.420\nquality management.\n\n12\n00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.491\nAnd what we're talking about is not\nnecessarily all the things that provide\n\n13\n00:00:45.491 --> 00:00:49.624\nfor that, but how do we tend to manage\nthis and how do we plan to actually manage\n\n14\n00:00:49.624 --> 00:00:53.966\nour quality controls and our quality\nassurances is what we're taking a look at.\n\n15\n00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:57.201\nSo it's something that's\nactually very important for\n\n16\n00:00:57.201 --> 00:01:01.741\nus especially when we start doing projects\nbecause a project can be assigned to\n\n17\n00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:04.037\nus and we know what the deliverable is.\n\n18\n00:01:04.037 --> 00:01:08.980\nBut remember that the deliverable,\nif I can say it right, the deliverable,\n\n19\n00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.489\nor the product of whatever the result is\n\n20\n00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:16.590\nfrom that project needs to be able\nto meet a certain level of standard.\n\n21\n00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.330\nIt's not enough, and\n\n22\n00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.480\nwe've actually done this throughout\nour entire manufacturing history here\n\n23\n00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.660\non the planet, is that it's not enough\njust to say that we've produced something.\n\n24\n00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.670\nWe have to actually be able to\nproduce something that meets\n\n25\n00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.220\na particular standard.\n\n26\n00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.520\nWe might actually take a look,\nlet's say for an example,\n\n27\n00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.420\nin the automobile industry\nhere in the United States.\n\n28\n00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.560\nIn which when we talk about putting\na car out onto the road with hundreds or\n\n29\n00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.310\nthousands of other vehicles out there,\nit shouldn't actually be of such poor\n\n30\n00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.340\nquality that the wheels fall off every\ntime we make a right turn or a left turn.\n\n31\n00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.500\nSo, there is some manufacturing\nquality standard that\n\n32\n00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.820\nall these vehicles go by that run on\nthe roads here in the United States,\n\n33\n00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.820\nin which they met a certain quality.\n\n34\n00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.760\nAnd we all demand it even in\nother products that we buy.\n\n35\n00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.300\nLet's take for an example the idea\nof something just like a laptop or\n\n36\n00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.310\na TV that you might buy.\n\n37\n00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.886\nThe very fact is Daniel if you spent\nseveral hundred dollars on a TV,\n\n38\n00:02:14.886 --> 00:02:18.036\nI'm pretty sure you're expecting\nsome level of quality.\n\n39\n00:02:18.036 --> 00:02:21.853\nYou're not expecting some particular box\nthat really isn't gonna meet up to your\n\n40\n00:02:21.853 --> 00:02:22.859\nstandards, right?\n\n41\n00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.130\n>> Yeah, no, I expect if I spend\na certain amount of money,\n\n42\n00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.330\nto get a certain level of quality for\nthat money.\n\n43\n00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.050\nIf it's a high level of money well\nthen I expect a high level of quality.\n\n44\n00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.780\nIf it's a lower level of money [COUGH]\nexcuse me, well then I expect what?\n\n45\n00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.530\nA lower level of quality because as the\nold saying goes, you get what you pay for.\n\n46\n00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.970\nNow when we come into it\nas far as doing a project,\n\n47\n00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.990\nwe have to ascertain what is the level\nof quality that is expected.\n\n48\n00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.880\nAnd that's kinda what\nwe're diving in today.\n\n49\n00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.620\nRight, Ronnie?\n\n50\n00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.240\n>> It really is.\n\n51\n00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.140\nThe very fact that as we understand\nsomething about the way that\n\n52\n00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.860\nquality ends up working through\na manufacturing process.\n\n53\n00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.080\nQuality can be lessened very easily,\nwhen people take their eye off the ball.\n\n54\n00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.160\nIn other words, they don't know\nwhat they're measuring for.\n\n55\n00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.620\nAll they look for is the end result and\nthey go look, it looks exactly like\n\n56\n00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.640\nwhat it should be, but maybe all the\ncomponents inside aren't actually meeting\n\n57\n00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.060\nup to the standards in which they\nwere designed to actually be used in.\n\n58\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.140\nSo when you have something like that\nyou hate to pick on certain things but\n\n59\n00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.660\nlet's say that you go to one of those\nwholesale tool outlet places, right?\n\n60\n00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.690\nAnd you go and\nyou buy certain things from there.\n\n61\n00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.350\nAs long as you're probably gonna use them\nonce or twice or not on a regular basis,\n\n62\n00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.070\nthose types of tools will end up\nprobably serving you just fine.\n\n63\n00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.300\nBut Daniel, if you and I were actually on\na construction site, and I were to hand\n\n64\n00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.200\nyou, let's say like a one and a half inch\nwrench, and I told you, hey this came\n\n65\n00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.120\nfrom the discount tool quality here's\nthe one you're gonna be using each and\n\n66\n00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.000\nevery day to turn these gigantic,\nthis inch and a half nut, on everything.\n\n67\n00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.470\nYou'd probably look at me a little\nbit strange, wouldn't you?\n\n68\n00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.364\n>> Yeah I'm gonna say, Ronnie this is\nprobably not the best tool for this job.\n\n69\n00:04:02.364 --> 00:04:07.490\nCuz as I start to torque down\nthose giant sized nuts and\n\n70\n00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.360\nbolts whats gonna happen, well that wrench\nis probably gonna break on me because its\n\n71\n00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.789\nquality isn't up to the job, right.\n\n72\n00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:17.850\nI need something that's going to\nbe durable and gonna last me for\n\n73\n00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.890\nmore than just a few turns\nof just a few bolts.\n\n74\n00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.330\nIt's great, like Ronny said, basically\nyou're kind of, you're paying a lot less\n\n75\n00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.530\nmoney to get something that you're\nbasically renting for five or\n\n76\n00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.115\nsix times that you get to use it.\n\n77\n00:04:30.115 --> 00:04:31.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or however many times it\n\n78\n00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.330\ngoes beyond that, you really got a deal.\n\n79\n00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.000\nAnd then that does come into play as well,\nbut\n\n80\n00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.820\nI understand that that quality, that part\nis not going to be up to what I need so\n\n81\n00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.610\nwe got to go back to\nthe drawing board on it.\n\n82\n00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.890\n>> Yeah, and that's why it's very\nimportant in project management.\n\n83\n00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.000\nThe very fact that we're supposed to\nproduce some type of unique results,\n\n84\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.940\nsome type of unique product when\nwe're actually done with this,\n\n85\n00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.600\ndoesn't mean that we can just go,\nokay, that's all that we need to do,\n\n86\n00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.940\nunless that's exactly what\nyour hoping to turn out.\n\n87\n00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.040\nBut a lot of times, you're gonna actually\nsee that your stakeholders expect\n\n88\n00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.650\na certain amount of quality to\nbe in the work that you produce.\n\n89\n00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.190\nAnd so we need to actually take\na look at this as project managers.\n\n90\n00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.150\nWhat we actually realize is\nthat if we don't plan for\n\n91\n00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.230\nquality, we're not gonna get\nwhatever we believe we're gonna get,\n\n92\n00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.510\nwe're gonna get something less,\nsubstandard.\n\n93\n00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.960\nSo we need to come up with what we call,\nof course then,\n\n94\n00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.280\na quality management plan that\nallows us as the project manager to\n\n95\n00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.370\nknow that whatever it is that we\nachieve is gonna meet that certain\n\n96\n00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.760\nlevel of standard that we need\nto achieve on our project.\n\n97\n00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.490\nAnd the way that we do that of course\nis by looking at several elements.\n\n98\n00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.880\nLet's make sure we understand what we're\ngonna learn as we actually develop this\n\n99\n00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.830\nquality management plan.\n\n100\n00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.390\nSo, go ahead and let's take a look at my\nmachine here and that way we'll actually\n\n101\n00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.190\nsee the diagram that I created here,\na little list overall.\n\n102\n00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.930\nSo let's talk about this purpose here.\n\n103\n00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.860\nNow a lot of us are probably thinking\nright now as we're looking at it,\n\n104\n00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.340\nhey, the very fact is,\nI understand, Ronnie.\n\n105\n00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.380\nYou've made a great point,\n\n106\n00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.420\nit's common sense, we know that we\nneed a certain level of quality.\n\n107\n00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.750\nWell, remember that qualities can\ncome from many different places.\n\n108\n00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.280\nAnd the problem that you have\nis in your project, right.\n\n109\n00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.600\nHow do you tell everybody else\nthat's working on your project\n\n110\n00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.790\nthat here's what's acceptable and\nhere is what isn't.\n\n111\n00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:18.260\nThe only way you can do so is if you've\ntaken the time to take a look at it and\n\n112\n00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.660\nshown people that you've\ndone this as well.\n\n113\n00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.140\nSo what you're actually doing here\nwhen you create a quality management\n\n114\n00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:29.530\nplan first and foremost is that you\nare documenting your decisions about how\n\n115\n00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.290\nyou're gonna judge this quality,\nhow you're gonna manage it.\n\n116\n00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.850\nAnd that's something that everybody\non your project team needs to know.\n\n117\n00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.060\nAnd this gives them a bit of freedom,\nright?\n\n118\n00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.530\nTo be able to say certain things.\n\n119\n00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.300\nWhat can they actually allow them to do\nis take a look at the project comes to\n\n120\n00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.650\na completion as certain elements\nin their work packages are done.\n\n121\n00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.359\nThey might be able to, instead of having\nto ask every single time, is this okay?\n\n122\n00:06:53.359 --> 00:06:57.032\nThey actually look at the idea of\nthe quality management plan and\n\n123\n00:06:57.032 --> 00:07:02.050\nthey actually look at the quality controls\nand assurances that have to be there.\n\n124\n00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.670\nAnd then they know whether or\nnot it's good or\n\n125\n00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.690\nthey need turn on to make another one.\n\n126\n00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.390\nSo it does give you that.\n\n127\n00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:11.060\nIt also shows that if you taken time and\nenergy right?\n\n128\n00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.050\nTo think about the idea of\nwhat is standard that you're\n\n129\n00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.830\nactually putting this by.\n\n130\n00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.800\nAnd so every single hand tool that's\nactually done here in America a lot of\n\n131\n00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.500\ntimes, tells you it meets or exceeds\na particular quality level standard.\n\n132\n00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.510\nAnd that means it could be\nan industry wide thing.\n\n133\n00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.930\nIt could be a governmental regulation.\n\n134\n00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.100\nIt could be something else in which\nthey set their quality baselines by.\n\n135\n00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.733\nAnd we'll talk about those baselines\na little bit later on as well,\n\n136\n00:07:33.733 --> 00:07:34.826\njust briefly okay?\n\n137\n00:07:34.826 --> 00:07:37.161\nWe also show in the plan, okay,\n\n138\n00:07:37.161 --> 00:07:41.665\nhow we're going to achieve\nthe standards and that is the key.\n\n139\n00:07:41.665 --> 00:07:46.081\nIt's not that we can't judge quality, we\ntake a look at it, and when we take a look\n\n140\n00:07:46.081 --> 00:07:50.442\nat whatever we want to buy, we look at the\nquality and go, man that was well made.\n\n141\n00:07:50.442 --> 00:07:55.271\nBut how do we actually achieve that if\nI'm actually the one making that result,\n\n142\n00:07:55.271 --> 00:07:59.468\nthat product, whatever it is,\nOkay, it's actually right there.\n\n143\n00:07:59.468 --> 00:08:03.350\nHow do I know how to achieve\nthat quality standard?\n\n144\n00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.920\nAnd that we're actually\nplanning that out as well.\n\n145\n00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.200\nSo the good thing is you and I don't\nreinvent the wheel on a lot of this.\n\n146\n00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.800\nIf we come from a manufacturing basis,\nand a lot of us do.\n\n147\n00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.760\nWe end up in a country which\nhas some manufacturing basis.\n\n148\n00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.940\nWhat's gonna end up happening is that\nyou're probably gonna pick those fields,\n\n149\n00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.130\ncuz that's where a lot of the quality\npractices really do come from.\n\n150\n00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.690\nIs that we take their programs,\n\n151\n00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.540\nand implement them in\nwhatever field that we're in.\n\n152\n00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.404\nSo you might have actually heard\nof somebody mentioning, TQM, okay.\n\n153\n00:08:33.404 --> 00:08:35.290\nTotal Quality Management.\n\n154\n00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:37.950\nAnd this is just another program\nthat's actually out there\n\n155\n00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.556\nthat allows people to take a look\nat whatever they're manufacturing,\n\n156\n00:08:41.556 --> 00:08:43.210\nwhatever they're product is.\n\n157\n00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.930\nAnd run it through what they call a TQM,\nthe Total Quality Management.\n\n158\n00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.100\nAnd see if that needs or\nexceeds those standards.\n\n159\n00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:54.070\nAnd they're essentially best practices for\nus, so you might see that a lot of times.\n\n160\n00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.370\nNow, the one that's actually\ninsanely popular of course then,\n\n161\n00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.300\nis also what you call Six Sigma, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:05.360\nSix Sigma for us is at quality\nlevel standard and strange, but\n\n163\n00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.930\nit actually comes out of the idea\nof standard deviations, too.\n\n164\n00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.230\nSo when you talk about Six Sigma,\n\n165\n00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.930\nthey're actually talking about here's\nwhat the quality standards are.\n\n166\n00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.030\nYou know that's actually\nacceptable as well.\n\n167\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.660\nAnd you can go through those\ndifferent standards too.\n\n168\n00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.660\nAnd then in the manufacturing base\nof the entire globe right now,\n\n169\n00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.000\nit's also the ISO 9000 series or ISO 9000.\n\n170\n00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.040\nThese are also quality management\ntypes of standards that you might find\n\n171\n00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.850\nin a manufacturing base.\n\n172\n00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.740\nSo a lot of the stuff that\nwe end up taking a look at,\n\n173\n00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:39.730\neven in some type of product that we're\ngenerating or even some type of process.\n\n174\n00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:43.130\nWe run it through whatever it is that's\nactually standardized for our industry.\n\n175\n00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.580\nAnd we normally pick one\nof these as the basis.\n\n176\n00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.500\nIf not, it means you really have to\ncome up with your own set of guidelines\n\n177\n00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.530\nto figure out what that quality\nstandard is going to be.\n\n178\n00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:53.630\nSo most of us instead,\n\n179\n00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:57.500\nsince we don't wanna reinvent the wheel,\nwe're gonna use something like this.\n\n180\n00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:02.380\nBut this management plan, right,\ngives us now inside of our project\n\n181\n00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.750\nthat we planned out what\nwe need to have for this.\n\n182\n00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.550\nSo that's the whole purpose.\n\n183\n00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:14.770\nSo what in the world really goes in\nto then a quality management plan?\n\n184\n00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.990\nWell, when we break it down,\n\n185\n00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:20.630\nthere's actually several things\nthat end up having to go on here.\n\n186\n00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.490\nAnd one of the things that we talk about,\n\n187\n00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:27.800\nof course, is what we call quality\nassurance, is what we hear about.\n\n188\n00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.140\nSo if you hear about the terms like QA,\nQC,\n\n189\n00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.984\nif you hear that acronym because\nthat's thrown around a lot, right?\n\n190\n00:10:33.984 --> 00:10:37.610\nThat stands for quality assurance,\nquality control, okay.\n\n191\n00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:42.150\nNow those two,\na lot of times seem to be simultaneous or\n\n192\n00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:46.170\nactually are synonymous, I shouldn't say\nsimultaneous, synonymous with each other.\n\n193\n00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:50.420\nBut there is a difference between one and\nthe other here.\n\n194\n00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.250\nAnd that's what you have to\nactually pay attention to, okay?\n\n195\n00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.500\nWhen you start talking about\nthe ideas of quality assurance,\n\n196\n00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:03.110\nyou're now talking about the structure and\nthe processes that are actually there.\n\n197\n00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.430\nTo say hey, here's how we know\n\n198\n00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:11.490\nthat we're gonna be able to achieve the\nquality that we're going to achieve, okay?\n\n199\n00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:15.462\nSo we put into place into our structure,\ninto our work package,\n\n200\n00:11:15.462 --> 00:11:20.400\ninto whatever we actually have, some\ntype of quality assurance is what we do.\n\n201\n00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.110\nAnd that could be a particular\nprocess that might be there.\n\n202\n00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:27.030\nIt could be some type of evaluation, or\n\n203\n00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:31.020\nit could be just a condition to help\nus to meet a failure of some sort.\n\n204\n00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.940\nIt actually says, this product doesn't\nactually meet up to what we believe it is\n\n205\n00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.710\nas far as a quality assurance goes.\n\n206\n00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:42.190\nSo when you start taking a look at\nthe idea of things like prevention here,\n\n207\n00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:45.180\nwhich is my first point\nunderneath quality assurance.\n\n208\n00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.770\nIs that what we're actually doing is,\n\n209\n00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:50.630\nwe are trying to figure out,\nhere it is in my process.\n\n210\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.950\nHow do I keep defects out\nof my deliverables, right?\n\n211\n00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.770\nSo prevention is keeping the defects out.\n\n212\n00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:59.670\nNow the reason why this is important,\n\n213\n00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:04.130\nright, is if I produce a thousand of those\ndifferent products, whatever it might be.\n\n214\n00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:09.005\nWell, remember that there can be many\ndefects that creep in in that process,\n\n215\n00:12:09.005 --> 00:12:12.609\nand what you have there is,\nit could come from anything.\n\n216\n00:12:12.609 --> 00:12:15.886\nWell, how do you know where\nit actually came from?\n\n217\n00:12:15.886 --> 00:12:21.174\nSo, a standard, or an example, excuse me,\nthat you tend to hear in a lot of project\n\n218\n00:12:21.174 --> 00:12:26.634\nmanagement training is, let's just pick\nsomething simple like blue jeans, okay?\n\n219\n00:12:26.634 --> 00:12:30.042\nNow, I don't know everywhere\nelse around the planet but\n\n220\n00:12:30.042 --> 00:12:35.040\nI know here in the United States I wear\nthem, Daniel's wearing a pair right now.\n\n221\n00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.480\nThis is kind of standard fair just about,\nin other words, blue jeans are that way.\n\n222\n00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:46.890\nBut there's a particular quality assurance\nof certain name brands that we have.\n\n223\n00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.680\nAnd that's because they actually put\ninto their manufacturing processes\n\n224\n00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.930\nwhat they look for and what they look at.\n\n225\n00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.810\nSo, let's say what ends up\nhappening at times, right?\n\n226\n00:12:55.810 --> 00:13:01.170\nIs that when they go through the process\nof manufacturing 1,000 blue jeans,\n\n227\n00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:03.360\nthey actually run them\nthrough different machines.\n\n228\n00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.410\nAnd let's say that they start realizing\nthat there comes a point in which\n\n229\n00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:10.970\nthere are certain pairs that\njust keep tearing at one seam.\n\n230\n00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.700\nOr they keep separating\nat a back pocket or\n\n231\n00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.840\nthe belt loops aren't actually sewn\nin the way that they need to, okay.\n\n232\n00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.510\nWell, what they do then is somebody\ncomes along and takes a look at it, and\n\n233\n00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.345\nthen begins to analyze that process.\n\n234\n00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:28.730\nAnd says, well,\nwhy is that belt loop loose in 100 out of\n\n235\n00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:32.470\nthe 5,000 pairs that we manufacture?\n\n236\n00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:33.670\nAnd when does it tend to happen?\n\n237\n00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.920\nThey start counting up, and\nthey might realize something that,\n\n238\n00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.230\nlet's say it happens on every 350th pair,\nokay?\n\n239\n00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:44.010\nWell, they might go back and go all right,\nis this a machine that's causing it or\n\n240\n00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:45.220\nis it human error?\n\n241\n00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.020\nWhatever it might be.\n\n242\n00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.420\nAnd then try and figure out as they\nwatch the process of that belt loop\n\n243\n00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.620\ngetting put onto that pair of\nblue jeans to go there it is.\n\n244\n00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.220\nThey spot it and then they try and say,\n\n245\n00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.510\nall right, so how do we prevent this from\nhappening in the way that it's happening?\n\n246\n00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:02.400\nSo what are we trying to say?\n\n247\n00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.150\nWe're trying to say,\n\n248\n00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:07.170\nhere's how we prevent defects from\ngetting into our deliverables as well.\n\n249\n00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:08.900\nSo it takes a little\nbit of an examination.\n\n250\n00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.610\nIt does take a lot, actually a lot of\nexamination is gonna go a long way in\n\n251\n00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:16.600\npreventing defects and\nassuring that the quality is high.\n\n252\n00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.290\nA really good example of this,\nI was actually watching this yesterday or\n\n253\n00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:20.090\nthe day before.\n\n254\n00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:21.850\nI play electric guitar, right?\n\n255\n00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:26.670\nAnd what's the difference between\na $300 guitar and a $3,000 guitar?\n\n256\n00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.170\nOf which I have both.\n\n257\n00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.030\nWhen I can tell you my $300\nguitars are very, very nice.\n\n258\n00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:36.720\nThey play well, but\nmy $3000 guitar is a much higher quality.\n\n259\n00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.770\nThe manufacturer of that guitar\nis called Paul Reed Smith.\n\n260\n00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:42.530\nThey were talking about\nthem creating their necks.\n\n261\n00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:45.200\nIt said it takes them 30\ndays to create a neck.\n\n262\n00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:45.890\n>> Wow.\n>> He said\n\n263\n00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:49.740\nI can tool you out a neck using our\nplant here in about a day and a half.\n\n264\n00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:50.970\nIt would be a neck,\nit would be functional.\n\n265\n00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:52.200\nYou could put it on a guitar and\nit would work.\n\n266\n00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.060\nHe goes, but the quality wouldn't be\nthere, the quality that we've become\n\n267\n00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:00.200\nto known that people know us for\nis where we take the time.\n\n268\n00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.630\nAnd the neck in the wood is gonna settle.\n\n269\n00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:05.400\nSo we shave a little bit off the neck and\nwe let it settle cuz it's gonna move.\n\n270\n00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.820\nAnd the next day we shave a little more\noff and we let it settle, it's gonna move.\n\n271\n00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.310\nThey said that they've had\npeople that come in to try,\n\n272\n00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.280\nefficiency experts,\nto speed up that process.\n\n273\n00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.759\nAnd they said, man we can get this down to\na three-day process easily and they said,\n\n274\n00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:18.512\nthere's no way.\n\n275\n00:15:18.512 --> 00:15:19.730\n[LAUGH].\nCuz they know,\n\n276\n00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.730\nthey've examined the process and\nthey've said this really\n\n277\n00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:27.560\nis to continue with our standards\nof quality, being up here.\n\n278\n00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.210\nTo continue with that,\nwe have to do this 30-day process,\n\n279\n00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.740\nthere's no way, here's your check,\nthank you for your advice.\n\n280\n00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:36.296\nBut we're gonna continue doing it this way\nbecause, gotta keep that standard high.\n\n281\n00:15:36.296 --> 00:15:38.309\nYeah, and so when you start\ntaking a look at that, right?\n\n282\n00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:42.870\nAnd now you actually go, here's where\na process somebody says, I can speed up.\n\n283\n00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.707\nThen you go back and\nreview the design and then you realize,\n\n284\n00:15:45.707 --> 00:15:47.367\nwhy is this the quality that it is?\n\n285\n00:15:47.367 --> 00:15:51.278\nAnd you can actually see everything that\nthey put into it that speeding up that\n\n286\n00:15:51.278 --> 00:15:53.504\nprocess may actually lead to more defects,\n\n287\n00:15:53.504 --> 00:15:56.044\nthan it really leads to\nactually better quality.\n\n288\n00:15:56.044 --> 00:15:57.778\nSo you may get a review of anything right?\n\n289\n00:15:57.778 --> 00:16:00.183\nSo it could be a machine\nthat they're using,\n\n290\n00:16:00.183 --> 00:16:03.349\nthat there's some snag right\nthen as they're going across\n\n291\n00:16:03.349 --> 00:16:07.640\nthat bottom stitch that tends to happen\nafter it wears down a little bit.\n\n292\n00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.840\nSo you might find out that\nits a maintenance thing.\n\n293\n00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.520\nSo, you know, you end up finding\nthese things out and then you of\n\n294\n00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:17.140\ncourse put a fix in to go ahead and\nactually add that in for prevention.\n\n295\n00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:21.170\nThe other one that we also mention here\nare things like appraisals as well, okay.\n\n296\n00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:24.430\nAppraisal is exactly like it sounds like,\nit is the idea of inspecting,\n\n297\n00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:29.360\ntesting, auditing whatever that\ndeliverable quality is going to be, and\n\n298\n00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.100\nthis is also something that's\nactually very important for us too.\n\n299\n00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:37.580\nThe inspection and actually doing quality\ninspection is a very good one, right?\n\n300\n00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.780\nSo the way that we do for\nquality assurance is just like,\n\n301\n00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:45.830\nI remember as a kid, I don't know why\nthis one pops up, but there was a, it\n\n302\n00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:50.250\nused to be on under garments, there was an\nactual sticker that would actually be on\n\n303\n00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:54.710\nyour under garments that said inspected by\nnumber 12 or something like that, right?\n\n304\n00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.170\nWell, what did that mean?\n\n305\n00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.222\nThat meant that somebody\nactually took a sticker,\n\n306\n00:16:58.222 --> 00:17:00.980\nat least that's what we used to think,\ntook a sticker off, right?\n\n307\n00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.070\nAnd they may not actually inspected every\nsingle batch that was out there but\n\n308\n00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:08.280\nthey pulled out a random batch and they\ntake a look at the quality and inspect,\n\n309\n00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:11.480\nthey wanna make sure that everybody\nknew that it was actually inspected.\n\n310\n00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.670\nWell, that again is an appraisal\nprocess that insures that,\n\n311\n00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:20.250\nhey this product meets what the quality\nlevel that we want it to meet, okay?\n\n312\n00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:24.060\nAnd of course, the most minimal way\n[LAUGH], okay, that we can actually do\n\n313\n00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.130\nquality assurance and say, look,\nhere's how we know a product failed.\n\n314\n00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:33.070\nNow we're setting the bar as low as we can\nonce we actually say outright failure.\n\n315\n00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:35.990\nOkay?\nIs what we're looking for.\n\n316\n00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:37.580\nAnd the reason why is that,\n\n317\n00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.610\nfailure can happen at any time\nin our process here, okay?\n\n318\n00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:44.690\nIt can happen during\nthe manufacturing process, okay?\n\n319\n00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.550\nThat we go all right here it is.\n\n320\n00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:49.930\nBut it can happen even later than that,\nokay, as well.\n\n321\n00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.190\nSo you can have what\nare called internal failures.\n\n322\n00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:55.560\nIf it happens while it's my\nresponsibility as a project manager,\n\n323\n00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.290\nthat's an internal failure,\nsomething I did not do.\n\n324\n00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:01.570\nBut then I see the product\nalong the way and I go,\n\n325\n00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.110\nokay, we can't do it that way anymore.\n\n326\n00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:08.020\nAnd now, we actually need to say, hey,\nwe've gotta redo this whole thing, okay?\n\n327\n00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:12.730\nBut that is a low level standard that\nreally can cost us a lot of time, but\n\n328\n00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.880\neven worse is when we have what\nwe call an external failure.\n\n329\n00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.620\nThe product gets out, we deliver it,\nand we turn it over to our customer.\n\n330\n00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:21.540\nAnd the customer looks at it and\n\n331\n00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:26.480\nsays, Ronnie,\nthat product was terrible, it's crud.\n\n332\n00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.700\nWe reject the product outright.\n\n333\n00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.770\nWell that's an external\nfailure at that point.\n\n334\n00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.880\nThat's the hardest way to\nlearn about quality assurance,\n\n335\n00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:41.050\nis when the customer says, I bought it,\nI have to accept it, but I can't use it.\n\n336\n00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:44.040\nThat is a terrible way\nto do quality assurance,\n\n337\n00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.970\nis to realize that your entire work\nprocess that you thought was perfect,\n\n338\n00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:51.610\nworked, gave you what you said that\nyou wanted, but it was terrible.\n\n339\n00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:52.230\nOkay?\n\n340\n00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.420\nSo a lot of times that's why in a project,\nright?\n\n341\n00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.850\nWe tend to do as much as we can\nto do prevention and appraisal.\n\n342\n00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:01.110\nPrevention's actually a lot easier, right?\n\n343\n00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.260\nIf we actually take all\nthe painstaking time to prevent\n\n344\n00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.330\nany types of errors from getting into our\ndeliverables as much as we can, okay?\n\n345\n00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:12.030\nThen to have to go back and\ncorrect 15,000 failures, okay?\n\n346\n00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:15.900\nSo there is, I'm guaranteeing you some\naccount out there's probably done this\n\n347\n00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:18.860\nlike, well,\nif you just let 10% of them go,\n\n348\n00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.830\nwe're perfectly fine with that cuz it's\ngonna cost you this much money to do that\n\n349\n00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:27.060\nrather than if you try and restructure,\nretool the entire product line.\n\n350\n00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:31.200\nWell, it actually depends on you and\nhow much you're willing to spend on that.\n\n351\n00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.750\nSo here are the things, right?\n\n352\n00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.790\nThe assurances are pretty much\nthe key is that we have some\n\n353\n00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.510\nprocess in our project\nthat's going to do that.\n\n354\n00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:43.090\nNow we also need to then talk about\nthe idea of quality control then.\n\n355\n00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:46.170\nWhereas assurance is\nthe process that we take,\n\n356\n00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:50.760\nthe quality control is how we know\nthat it's actually getting done, okay?\n\n357\n00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.000\nAnd so this one actually is\nmore hands on where we're\n\n358\n00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.480\ntalking about the actual inspection or\nwhatever it is that we do.\n\n359\n00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.516\nSo in terms of quality control then,\n\n360\n00:19:59.516 --> 00:20:03.196\nwe can actually think about the idea\nof benchmarking, and again,\n\n361\n00:20:03.196 --> 00:20:07.023\nthis is standard process for\nall of us that we've done this, right?\n\n362\n00:20:07.023 --> 00:20:11.285\nIs that there is a particular benchmark\nthat we want to meet before we're willing\n\n363\n00:20:11.285 --> 00:20:14.070\neven to allow that product to be release.\n\n364\n00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:17.076\nWhether if we're actually talking\nabout hand held wrenches,\n\n365\n00:20:17.076 --> 00:20:20.533\nlet's say a three quarter inch wrench,\nit might be where we say, look,\n\n366\n00:20:20.533 --> 00:20:22.935\nwe're gonna put this much pressure on it,\nokay?\n\n367\n00:20:22.935 --> 00:20:27.915\nAnd it better not break or bend,\npast whatever the tolerance is.\n\n368\n00:20:27.915 --> 00:20:29.630\nNow, here's my benchmark.\n\n369\n00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:35.060\nIf it bends or breaks at this point, no,\nwe're junking it, okay, there's no way.\n\n370\n00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.640\nSo you actually go through\nyour product line and\n\n371\n00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.980\nyou might do this type of testing, okay.\n\n372\n00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.950\nYou can also of course do\nthe cost-benefit analysis and\n\n373\n00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.360\nthis is where it is scary, right?\n\n374\n00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.310\nWhere we accept,\nwe do tradeoffs essentially, right?\n\n375\n00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:51.930\nWe say, yeah, if we don't worry about it,\nyou know, and we'll just accept those\n\n376\n00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:54.479\nreturns and we'll just replace it\nwith what we know is a good product.\n\n377\n00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:56.460\nYeah, you could say that.\n\n378\n00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.220\nOkay, that's a form of quality control.\n\n379\n00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:58.980\nYou're saying,\n\n380\n00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.440\nit's a poorer product, we didn't realize\nit got through the manufacturing,\n\n381\n00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.620\nwe'll give you another one that we\nknow that's actually gonna be good.\n\n382\n00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:09.240\nAnd then you can actually do\nwhat we call flowcharting here.\n\n383\n00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:13.030\nFlowcharting, especially in\nthe manufacturing process,\n\n384\n00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.680\nit tends to work in this way, right?\n\n385\n00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:21.050\nWhere you go all right, where do I want to\nactually implement some quality control?\n\n386\n00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:22.685\nIn other words, where's a gate?\n\n387\n00:21:22.685 --> 00:21:23.880\nOkay?\nIt gets up to this point here,\n\n388\n00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:27.610\nwhat are the things I need to take a look\nat before I allow it to go through or\n\n389\n00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.320\nI tell it it needs to go\nback in the process again?\n\n390\n00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.340\nSo all of these things can actually be\nadded into your project to help you out.\n\n391\n00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:35.710\nAnytime you add in more, right?\n\n392\n00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.804\nIt means your project is going to\nexpand a little bit of time and\n\n393\n00:21:38.804 --> 00:21:40.647\nmay cost a little bit more money, but\n\n394\n00:21:40.647 --> 00:21:44.003\nthat's what ends up happening\nwhen you start seeing this, okay?\n\n395\n00:21:44.003 --> 00:21:48.591\nSo once we have quality control and\nquality assurance measures on hand and\n\n396\n00:21:48.591 --> 00:21:53.475\nwe know that it's actually being done,\nit's kinda strange here that you go,\n\n397\n00:21:53.475 --> 00:21:57.397\nokay so if it met quality control,\nquality assurance is good,\n\n398\n00:21:57.397 --> 00:22:01.710\nthere also needs to be then a final\ntype of inspection process.\n\n399\n00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:04.840\nAnd this is what we call\nsome type of quality metric.\n\n400\n00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.140\nSo all these are actually based\noff of some type of metric here.\n\n401\n00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:11.810\nWhen we start talking about that from\nwhatever process it is that we do for\n\n402\n00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:15.630\nour project, we wanna make sure that what\nwe're defining clearly inside of our\n\n403\n00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:20.820\nproject plan is what is going to\nbe measured and how we measure it.\n\n404\n00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.320\nThat is our quality metric, okay?\n\n405\n00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.219\nIf Daniel says, I know how to measure\nthis, but he actually learned how to do it\n\n406\n00:22:27.219 --> 00:22:30.617\nin one way and I learned how to do it\nin a different way, remember that even\n\n407\n00:22:30.617 --> 00:22:34.410\nthough we should get the same results if\nit's just a standard measurement here,\n\n408\n00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.472\nwe may find out something, that we don't,\n\n409\n00:22:36.472 --> 00:22:40.006\nwe don't actually get that same\nmeasurement that we think we're after.\n\n410\n00:22:40.006 --> 00:22:44.010\nSo we need to define what and how,\nokay, are we going to do this?\n\n411\n00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:47.500\nI'm gonna be doing this on every\n100th product that comes off my line,\n\n412\n00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.878\nevery 1500 and\nthis is how we're gonna do it.\n\n413\n00:22:49.878 --> 00:22:53.460\nWe're gonna measure from here to here and\nthis is what needs to take place.\n\n414\n00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:57.250\nAnd so we actually define that very\nclearly we also of course to find how\n\n415\n00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.840\noften we're gonna actually\ngoing to measure this too.\n\n416\n00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:05.080\nSo we might say, again, we're gonna\nactually do a measurement every 23 hours\n\n417\n00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.540\nof whatever this product is.\n\n418\n00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.163\nWe talked about on the guitar necks,\nright?\n\n419\n00:23:09.163 --> 00:23:13.920\nThat when you actually measure if it\nabsorbs enough humidity, it starts to bend\n\n420\n00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:18.970\ntoo much, or if it doesn't absorb enough,\nyou actually have to measure that.\n\n421\n00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:21.060\nYou can't just say,\nI'll just make 300 of these,\n\n422\n00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:26.280\nand then we'll measure them at some point\nwhen we think about it as well, okay?\n\n423\n00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.280\nWe can also come up with checklists, okay?\n\n424\n00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.070\nChecklists is exactly like it sounds like.\n\n425\n00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.210\nWhen you go through your\nprocess of whatever it is for\n\n426\n00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:35.220\nyour project, you go ahead and\nyou actually check it off.\n\n427\n00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:39.280\nAnd you go, I met this particular\nmeasurement of quality, I met this one,\n\n428\n00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.240\nI did this to ensure that this\nquality is actually there.\n\n429\n00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.624\nAnd you do a lot of this,\n\n430\n00:23:43.624 --> 00:23:48.486\nespecially in those processes that require\nlike torquing something down, okay?\n\n431\n00:23:48.486 --> 00:23:50.988\nAnd then ultimately,\nthere's exit criteria.\n\n432\n00:23:50.988 --> 00:23:54.359\nYou might have a final quality\ninspector that goes around and\n\n433\n00:23:54.359 --> 00:23:56.284\nactually does this kind of thing.\n\n434\n00:23:56.284 --> 00:23:59.112\nSays before we'll even release\nit with our name on it,\n\n435\n00:23:59.112 --> 00:24:02.850\nhere's our quality control inspector\nto do something like this.\n\n436\n00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:04.550\nAnd so\nwhen you start seeing stuff like that,\n\n437\n00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:08.220\nthat's when you know that now you\nhave the quality assurances in place.\n\n438\n00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.570\nWell, that you have to manage, right?\n\n439\n00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:11.530\nYou can't just say, well,\nwe'll take a look at it.\n\n440\n00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.400\nYou need to know what is\ngonna be measured and\n\n441\n00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.080\nwhat the criteria is as a project manager.\n\n442\n00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.260\nWhat you don't want is something that\ngets put out there and somebody says,\n\n443\n00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.530\nwell, you put it out there.\n\n444\n00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:25.200\nYeah, well, I didn't have a clue what my\nexit criteria was before I turned it over.\n\n445\n00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.430\nSo you need to know what those things are.\n\n446\n00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:32.380\nAnd lastly, again, we'll talk about\nbaselines just briefly here, okay?\n\n447\n00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:35.470\nNow the reason why I wanted to mention\nthis, right, is that, remember,\n\n448\n00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:37.150\nwe don't have to actually restart or\n\n449\n00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:41.890\nreinvent the entire wheel on quality\nassurance and quality controls.\n\n450\n00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:45.830\nWe really don't have to because\nthere's a lot of processes in place.\n\n451\n00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:50.340\nThe other thing that you're actually gonna\nalso have to deal with in terms of quality\n\n452\n00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.670\nis the baseline of your project, okay?\n\n453\n00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:56.830\nYou realize something depending\non where you are in the world.\n\n454\n00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:59.390\nCertain things are gonna have to\nmeet certain levels of quality\n\n455\n00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:02.060\ndue to things like government regulations.\n\n456\n00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.680\nYou just have to, right?\n\n457\n00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.200\nHere in the States, there's a lot of\nstandards that are insanely strict.\n\n458\n00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.440\nNot all of them are actually\ndue to quality.\n\n459\n00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.590\nDon't get me wrong, there's a lot of\nthem especially manufacturing process\n\n460\n00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:14.050\nthat's due to quality.\n\n461\n00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:16.360\nBut it's the idea here\nthat they're regulated.\n\n462\n00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:20.860\nIn other words, the government demands\nthat you meet this level of quality, okay?\n\n463\n00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.380\nAnd that's gonna be true\nall over the world as well.\n\n464\n00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.360\nOr, you're not gonna actually\nhave a project to work on.\n\n465\n00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.010\nSo you may have to take that into\nconsideration, and that's a big one.\n\n466\n00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:34.730\nAlso, depending on the industry\nthat you're working in as well.\n\n467\n00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:35.890\nYou may find out, and\n\n468\n00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:39.240\nyou do need to pay attention to\nthe industry standards that are set.\n\n469\n00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.140\nIf those industries are actually\nset to where they're saying, look,\n\n470\n00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:45.920\neverybody in this business manufactures\nto this particular specification or\n\n471\n00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:51.220\nquality control here, then that means\nthat you need to do so as well, or you're\n\n472\n00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.880\ngonna actually find yourself not actually\nable to comply with what needs to be done.\n\n473\n00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.291\nInside of companies, though,\n\n474\n00:25:58.291 --> 00:26:04.021\nyou might find out also that they set\ntheir own corporate quality policies, too.\n\n475\n00:26:04.021 --> 00:26:07.975\nThis is probably by far the one\nthat's actually more important and\n\n476\n00:26:07.975 --> 00:26:11.390\ndirectly affects your\nproject on a daily basis.\n\n477\n00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:12.435\nIf your company has one,\n\n478\n00:26:12.435 --> 00:26:16.220\nyou'll follow whatever procedures\nthat they are actually gonna follow.\n\n479\n00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.970\nYou don't have to worry about trying to\nfigure out what your quality assurance and\n\n480\n00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:20.590\nwhat your quality control is gonna be.\n\n481\n00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:22.220\nYou're gonna be told, okay?\n\n482\n00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:26.248\nHere's what you're gonna have to do to\nprove that you're actually following these\n\n483\n00:26:26.248 --> 00:26:26.995\nmeasures out.\n\n484\n00:26:26.995 --> 00:26:29.317\nIt's the key as well.\n\n485\n00:26:29.317 --> 00:26:33.205\nAnd if you don't have anything else,\nokay, if you don't have any other\n\n486\n00:26:33.205 --> 00:26:37.300\nquality baselines, you can\nessentially say, here's my control.\n\n487\n00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:42.490\nHere's what I'm measuring against instead\nto actually indicate my level of quality.\n\n488\n00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.290\nWe do this in all sorts of things today.\n\n489\n00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:48.650\nWhereas we might set up, like we said,\nwe measure whatever it is.\n\n490\n00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.456\nThat three-quarter inch wrench,\nit has to be this long,\n\n491\n00:26:51.456 --> 00:26:55.466\nthis long, we may actually say, we need\nto measure that down to the 10,000th\n\n492\n00:26:55.466 --> 00:26:59.510\nmillimeter if we need to or even further,\nthat we say that it's gonna be this long.\n\n493\n00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:05.000\nAnd the thickness of that open-ended\nwrench has to be this thick.\n\n494\n00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.340\nAnd you may actually do stuff like that,\n\n495\n00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.450\nwhere you actually have\na control in itself.\n\n496\n00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:12.260\nAnd you go, all right,\nI'm gonna pull one off the line.\n\n497\n00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.820\nHere is my quality control product and\nwe can do this.\n\n498\n00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.300\nI remember when rebuilding diesel engines,\n\n499\n00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.580\nwe had this straight edge\nthat we bought for like $150.\n\n500\n00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:26.315\nIt just looked like a ruler, but\nits particular measurements and\n\n501\n00:27:26.315 --> 00:27:30.740\nits thickness and the way that it did,\nit guaranteed that it would never warp.\n\n502\n00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:35.340\nIt guaranteed that the edges would\nalways be perfectly flat and smooth so\n\n503\n00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:39.885\nthat if the head ever warped, you could\njust lay the thing down in crossways and\n\n504\n00:27:39.885 --> 00:27:43.480\nthen on side and everything and\nif it absolutely perfectly flat,\n\n505\n00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:47.280\nyou knew that the head was perfectly flat,\nokay?\n\n506\n00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.142\nSo you may have that type of\nquality measurement right\n\n507\n00:27:50.142 --> 00:27:52.951\nthere if you're doing\nsomething like that as well.\n\n508\n00:27:52.951 --> 00:27:57.466\nSo you will find out that those types\nof testing against control limits\n\n509\n00:27:57.466 --> 00:27:58.480\nare also a key.\n\n510\n00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:02.650\nBut normally, a lot of times, right,\nwe're not reinventing anything.\n\n511\n00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:05.350\nWe're just trying to follow whatever\nthe industry that we're in,\n\n512\n00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:07.410\nwhatever guidelines are given to us.\n\n513\n00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:11.980\nBut we, as project managers, need to\nunderstand quality has to be managed.\n\n514\n00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.840\nIt's not something you go, just do\nthe best you can, and then hope for\n\n515\n00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.260\nthe best, okay?\n\n516\n00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:19.000\nSo take the time, take a look here.\n\n517\n00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.720\nWe're not getting super in depth\ninto any one particular measurement.\n\n518\n00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.670\nWe're not talking about any one standard.\n\n519\n00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:26.720\nIt's about what managing and\nsaying, all right,\n\n520\n00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.840\nI know that there has to\nbe some quality control.\n\n521\n00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.100\nWhat are the measurements here and\nhow am I gonna be able to manage them?\n\n522\n00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:32.885\n>> Yep, that's it.\n\n523\n00:28:32.885 --> 00:28:36.697\nYou have to be checking your\nprogress as you go for that quality,\n\n524\n00:28:36.697 --> 00:28:39.570\nthat it's meeting a certain standard.\n\n525\n00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:43.040\nOr by the time it gets to the last\nperson that's inspecting it, suddenly,\n\n526\n00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.250\nthey're gonna go, this is horrible.\n\n527\n00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:46.700\nNobody checked anything on this.\n\n528\n00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.970\nI'm going back to\nthe example of the guitars.\n\n529\n00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:52.700\nI was watching a factory tour of them\nbuilding guitars and their process.\n\n530\n00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.080\nThey said that every person\nthat handles the guitar.\n\n531\n00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.335\nSo I go from sanding the bodies down.\n\n532\n00:28:57.335 --> 00:29:00.910\nWell, the guy that's gonna stain the body,\nhe inspects the guy that sanded it\n\n533\n00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:03.170\nto make sure that it was sanded\nto the correct specifications.\n\n534\n00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.240\nIf it doesn't,\nhe sends it back to the sander.\n\n535\n00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.590\nAnd when it comes back, he inspects\nit again and then he stains it.\n\n536\n00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:11.210\nWell then, he sends that onto\nthe guy that puts the clear coat,\n\n537\n00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:12.354\nthe top coat on top of it.\n\n538\n00:29:12.354 --> 00:29:15.264\nWell that guy is gonna inspect the\nstandard to make sure that the staining\n\n539\n00:29:15.264 --> 00:29:16.462\nprocess was done correctly.\n\n540\n00:29:16.462 --> 00:29:20.390\nIf there's any light spots or\ntoo dark or whatever, he sends it back.\n\n541\n00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:23.700\nThere's that quality control all\nthe way through the process.\n\n542\n00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.200\nSo by the time it gets to that exiter,\nhe's looking at this thing going,\n\n543\n00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.410\nman my job is easy.\n\n544\n00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:32.545\nEverything's been inspected so\nmany times that this is a fine instrument.\n\n545\n00:29:32.545 --> 00:29:35.140\nIt should have no quality issues.\n\n546\n00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.810\nBut he's still there,\nhe still has a job to check and\n\n547\n00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:40.350\nverify like we always used to say, right?\n\n548\n00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:41.786\nTrust, yet verify everything.\n\n549\n00:29:41.786 --> 00:29:43.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is done correctly.\n\n550\n00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:47.230\nRonnie, lots of cool stuff when it comes\nto quality, something that we wanna pay\n\n551\n00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:50.900\nattention to because we don't wanna\nput our name on a bad product or\n\n552\n00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:55.170\na bad project that creates a bad product,\nso something we wanna pay attention to.\n\n553\n00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:58.620\nThank you so much for explaining the\ndifferent ways in which we can do that.\n\n554\n00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:02.190\nAll the cool metrics that are out\nthere and the tools available for\n\n555\n00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:06.150\nus to measure and\njudge to make sure these things are right.\n\n556\n00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:07.582\nAnd that being said,\nwe thank you for watching us.\n\n557\n00:30:07.582 --> 00:30:10.380\nWell, looks like we've come to\nthe end of another great episode.\n\n558\n00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.930\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host,

another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.740\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.870\nIn today's episode,\nwe are moving on with our Project+ series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.400\nJoining us back in the studio again\ntoday to help us out with a little bit\n\n7\n00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.580\nof cost management is our good friend and\nmentor, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.950\nRonnie, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n9\n00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.200\n>> Well, thank you again for having me\nback on the show as we continue on to take\n\n10\n00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.430\na look at more of\nthe Project+ from CompTIA.\n\n11\n00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.970\nAnd today, we are actually\ntalking more about planning.\n\n12\n00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.050\nSo we've already said it before,\nand I'll say it again,\n\n13\n00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.260\nnow that we're a little bit\nfurther into the series here.\n\n14\n00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.440\nThe idea of planning for projects,\n\n15\n00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.870\nright, is pretty much the longest\nprocess that we do have.\n\n16\n00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.580\nAnd it's by far the most\nimportant thing that we do\n\n17\n00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.990\nis make sure that we plan these things\nout before we ever spend a dollar.\n\n18\n00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.870\nAnd so, this way,\n\n19\n00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.750\nwe absolutely can say that we've tried to\nconsider every thing that needs to go on.\n\n20\n00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.100\nAnd try and keep an eye on it.\n\n21\n00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.460\nAnd, of course, one of the most important\nideas here is gonna be planning out\n\n22\n00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.580\ncost management, which is a big part\nthat we also need to do as a project.\n\n23\n00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.490\nRemember that when we talk about\nthe triple constraints of a project, we're\n\n24\n00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.630\nnormally constrained by time, by cost and,\nof course, by the actual requirements.\n\n25\n00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.590\nNow, in the previous episode,\n\n26\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.940\nwe talked about the requirements a little\nbit when we talked about planning for\n\n27\n00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.150\nthings like quality control or\nquality management there.\n\n28\n00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.270\nWe also talked about time when we\ntalked about planning for scheduling.\n\n29\n00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.450\nAnd so now we're hitting that row\nthird kind of overall constraint,\n\n30\n00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.930\nwhere we now talk about\nthe idea of planning for\n\n31\n00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.500\ncost management, which is a big one for\nus as well, okay.\n\n32\n00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.130\nNow in this particular series,\nright, as we go through, we're not\n\n33\n00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.750\nreally diving in to everything that\nthere is to know about cost management.\n\n34\n00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.150\nI'm not an accountant.\n\n35\n00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.430\nI can't actually claim that I\ndo very well with my own funds.\n\n36\n00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.300\n>> I'm no CPA.\n\n37\n00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.330\n>> That's right, no CPA.\n\n38\n00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.040\nI can't tell you that I manage it,\nlike I said.\n\n39\n00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.940\nHeck, I don't even have ten dollars in my\nwallet right now, and the reason is that,\n\n40\n00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.650\nI can' even tell you where other\nten might have actually gone.\n\n41\n00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.800\nAt some point, but what I can tell you,\nthough, as a project manager,\n\n42\n00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.430\nis one of the key things that we need\nto make sure that we understand and\n\n43\n00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.980\nthat we keep in control and\nthat we do plan for, of course,\n\n44\n00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.980\nis the idea of spending money and how\nis that money spent, where is it spent?\n\n45\n00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.670\nBecause all that has to be accounted for\n\n46\n00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.950\nat the end of the project so\nthat what we can actually learn is,\n\n47\n00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.220\nis the overall product that we created,\nresult, situation, issue,\n\n48\n00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.740\nwhatever it is that we created, was it\nworth the money that we put into it.\n\n49\n00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.280\nSo, we really need to make sure that we\nunderstand that everything that we do,\n\n50\n00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.360\nespecially in planning here,\nand especially with the cost.\n\n51\n00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.040\nWe need to make sure that\nwe keep some account of it.\n\n52\n00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.650\nSo, depending on your level of experience,\nand also depending on where\n\n53\n00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.970\nyou tend to work, some of this\nis gonna be fairly easy for you.\n\n54\n00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.435\nIf you work for a larger company, that\nalready has a project management office\n\n55\n00:03:00.435 --> 00:03:04.760\nsetup, more than likely your project\nis gonna be assigned an accountant, and\n\n56\n00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.330\nthey are pretty much going to say,\nall right, here's the budget that's set.\n\n57\n00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.490\nYou and I need to sit down along with\nthe major stakeholders here and try and\n\n58\n00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.980\nmake sure that we put these\ninto the right locations,\n\n59\n00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.460\nand make sure that everything's actually\ndivvied out the way that we need to.\n\n60\n00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.470\nAnd make sure we get the authorization for\nspending that we need to and\n\n61\n00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.300\neverything else.\n\n62\n00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.130\nAnd you're gonna do fine\nwith some of that happens.\n\n63\n00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.590\nI know that this sounds almost fun Daniel,\nbut scary at the same time,\n\n64\n00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.120\nis instead when some eye look at you goes,\nhere's $25,000 for the project.\n\n65\n00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.780\nMake sure you spend it well.\n\n66\n00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.860\nAnd then, you look back, and go, okay.\n\n67\n00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.925\nAnd, the first thing on my mind, new car.\n\n68\n00:03:42.925 --> 00:03:44.580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, and that shouldn't be.\n\n69\n00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.600\nI'm joking with that.\n\n70\n00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.820\nBut you kinda, get the idea that it\ncan be a little bit more daunting to,\n\n71\n00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.550\nessentially, just say, here's the amount\nof money, and just make sure you spend it\n\n72\n00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.400\non the project, and make sure you\naccount for it And don't get me wrong.\n\n73\n00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.300\nThere's a lot of projects\nthat are done that way and\n\n74\n00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.830\npeople are really good at\nkeeping track of a lot of that.\n\n75\n00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.490\nBut if you're actually on these major,\n\n76\n00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.760\ngigantic projects where you're not talking\nabout just, let's say, $5,000 or $20,000.\n\n77\n00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.990\nYou're now starting to talk about\nhundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\n78\n00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.190\nSomebody at some accountant firm somewhere\n\n79\n00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.490\nis gonna want you to be able\nto keep account of that.\n\n80\n00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.810\nAnd so we're just gonna go through and\n\n81\n00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.340\nwe're gonna talk about some of\nthe planning processes that we have to\n\n82\n00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.310\nthink about.\n\n83\n00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.670\nWhen we actually start doing this, and\nunderstand some of the major components\n\n84\n00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:29.790\ninside of cost management plans that\nwe need to be able to identify as well.\n\n85\n00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.900\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look then.\n\n86\n00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.880\nOne of the very first components\nthat we need to think about overall\n\n87\n00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.630\nis what we call control limits.\n\n88\n00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.770\nNow that's a CompTIA term for\n\n89\n00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.260\nCompTIA's Project+ that you need\nto make sure that you know.\n\n90\n00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.270\nIf you are getting ready for\n\n91\n00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.140\nyour PMP, you might hear the term\ninstead control thresholds.\n\n92\n00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.630\nI wanna throw both of them out there,\ncuz you never know on the exam which\n\n93\n00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.370\none they're ever actually going to\nmention, and you might go, well why not?\n\n94\n00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.930\nWell, because, remember that as the exam\ncontinues on in its age, as they\n\n95\n00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.960\nactually develop new questions and add\nthem into the pool of questions here, you\n\n96\n00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.575\ndon't know weather or not they're going to\nuse an older term, like the control limits\n\n97\n00:05:07.575 --> 00:05:10.606\nthat were actually around when\nthe first objectives were made.\n\n98\n00:05:10.606 --> 00:05:13.550\nOr whether they're gonna say,\nhey we want this to line up more and\n\n99\n00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.410\nmore with the PMP.\n\n100\n00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.240\nSo you might use the term\ncontrol thresholds.\n\n101\n00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.460\nBoth of those are actually going\n\n102\n00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.340\nto be valid terms in what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n103\n00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.230\nNow what does this really mean when\nwe start talking about the idea of\n\n104\n00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.700\ncontrol limits for our costs?\n\n105\n00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.950\nWhat we're really talking\nabout is what I have here.\n\n106\n00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.720\nThe percentage deviation\nfrom the baseline costs.\n\n107\n00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.640\nNow when you start mentioning\nthe idea of baseline costs,\n\n108\n00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.930\nthis is our major assumption,\nour planned assumption.\n\n109\n00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.940\nOf what we believe the project\nis going to cost us, okay?\n\n110\n00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.000\nWe know that we understand or at least we\nbelieve that what will end up happening,\n\n111\n00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.910\nhere is the baseline here is\nthe general amount of money\n\n112\n00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.190\nthat we're gonna spend on our project.\n\n113\n00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:55.930\nBut it's really kind of\nan estimate at that point and\n\n114\n00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.530\nwhat we're now talking about\nis what can it deviate.\n\n115\n00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.830\nOkay, what are the limits\nthat we have on either side?\n\n116\n00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.320\nWe need to be able to understand that\nthere are certain limits that we can go\n\n117\n00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.650\nbeyond without having to worry about it,\nand\n\n118\n00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.630\nthen there's certain limits that we\nshouldn't go beyond without having to ask\n\n119\n00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.090\nfor some permission to go beyond that,\nand that's what we have.\n\n120\n00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.990\nIf you have a control limit in place in\nterms of your project plan, what you're\n\n121\n00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.660\nsaying is that this is an agreed upon\nvariance, based on the performance\n\n122\n00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:29.480\nthat hey, here's what's gonna happen\nbefore anything else needs to take place.\n\n123\n00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.180\nBefore some other action that brings\neverything back into control takes place.\n\n124\n00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.110\nSo you're saying give me this leeway.\n\n125\n00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.610\nThat's what you're essentially\nsaying is that I need for\n\n126\n00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.730\nmy baseline here to have a leeway of 5% or\n\n127\n00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:46.820\n10% of the budget of what we're\nactually planning for as a leeway.\n\n128\n00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.160\nUntil somebody else steps in and\n\n129\n00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.880\nsays Ronnie, you spent too much money,\nyou don't have any more money to spend.\n\n130\n00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.790\nHere is the variance that we have.\n\n131\n00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.310\nAnd the reason why you have to do\nthat now is because you don't know.\n\n132\n00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.580\nYou haven't spent a single dime.\n\n133\n00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.380\nYou don't have a clue even\nbased on any real data at all.\n\n134\n00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.900\nThat your project is gonna come out\nto be exactly what the baseline cost\n\n135\n00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.270\nis going to be.\n\n136\n00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.050\nSo what you do is you set up your estimate\nhere, about what you believe the entire\n\n137\n00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.840\nproject's gonna cost, and then you\nessentially sit down and you try and\n\n138\n00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.200\nfigure out what this\ncontrol limit is gonna be.\n\n139\n00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.640\nNow you may do this on every phase of\nyour project, or you may do it for\n\n140\n00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.090\nthe overall project schedule itself.\n\n141\n00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.750\nYou may end up finding out that you have\nto do it on certain work packages and\n\n142\n00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.380\nyou don't have to do it on\nother work packages here.\n\n143\n00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.820\nAnd the reason happens to be,\nof course, more uncertainty, or\n\n144\n00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.490\nthe idea of risk is another thing\nthat we have to worry about,\n\n145\n00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.040\nespecially when we start\ntalking about control limits.\n\n146\n00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.170\nThat there may be a certain\namount of risk even if you're\n\n147\n00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.900\nrisk adverse that you may say look,\nhere it is.\n\n148\n00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.818\nWe're willing to say that you have\nto be within this range here.\n\n149\n00:07:49.818 --> 00:07:54.433\nWe'd really like you to be here, but we're\nwilling to go 10% above that if we need to\n\n150\n00:07:54.433 --> 00:07:57.532\nwithout having to worry about\nstopping the whole thing and\n\n151\n00:07:57.532 --> 00:07:59.448\nthen getting more approval for it.\n\n152\n00:07:59.448 --> 00:08:04.553\nSo you gotta know what your control limits\nare gonna be inside of that initial\n\n153\n00:08:04.553 --> 00:08:10.830\nplanning, if you're going to set up to do\nthis for your project as well, all right?\n\n154\n00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:14.690\nSo that's kind of one of the key\nelements that needs to be there.\n\n155\n00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:19.280\nMost of the time what we end up doing\nright here is something that's really bad.\n\n156\n00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.030\nOkay?\n\n157\n00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.320\nIs that we give an estimate and\n\n158\n00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.530\nwe sound so\nconfident in our estimate at this point,\n\n159\n00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:32.240\nthat all of our project stakeholders\nassume that to be fact and true.\n\n160\n00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.630\nAnd then because we haven't spent\na single dime, we don't know.\n\n161\n00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.930\nAnd then when it comes down to spending\nmore money, somebody says, well,\n\n162\n00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:43.880\nRonnie that's not the amount you quoted us\non when we started working on the budget.\n\n163\n00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.760\nAnd so, you wanna make sure that\nyou set a clear expectation here.\n\n164\n00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.050\nNow here's the control limits that we\nneed to set up right at the beginning.\n\n165\n00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.820\nIt may not always happen, but\nyou at least have to make sure that\n\n166\n00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.260\nyou get something like\nthis in our project plan.\n\n167\n00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:57.900\n>> That's right.\n\n168\n00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.810\nAnd that comes down to the idea\nof estimating the cost.\n\n169\n00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.920\nIt's just a, it's exactly what it is.\n\n170\n00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.930\nLike Ronnie said it's an estimation.\n\n171\n00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.570\nNow we base that based\noff our expertise and\n\n172\n00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.790\nour experience that we have and\nour project management careers.\n\n173\n00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.290\nAnd it's probably going to be around that,\nbut sometimes things happen and\n\n174\n00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:21.550\nyou can't account for them and now you\nneed more money if the stake holders\n\n175\n00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:25.676\nbelieve that you've given the gospel\nof Paul as far as the estimate goes.\n\n176\n00:09:25.676 --> 00:09:26.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n177\n00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.510\nyou come in with a higher estimate now,\nthey're gonna start questioning your\n\n178\n00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.840\nintegrity maybe,\nyou're just looking for more money or\n\n179\n00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.530\nyou're not good at project management when\nreally you need to set the expectation for\n\n180\n00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.845\nthem that this is just\na very loose estimation.\n\n181\n00:09:41.845 --> 00:09:45.195\nLike we always like to say,\nwe like to under-promise and over-deliver,\n\n182\n00:09:45.195 --> 00:09:48.800\nso if you think the estimate's gonna\nbe 50,000 dollars, ask them for 75.\n\n183\n00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.463\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That way if it comes in at 50,\n\n184\n00:09:51.463 --> 00:09:53.667\nthey think you're great.\n\n185\n00:09:53.667 --> 00:09:57.187\nAnd if it comes in 75, they spend\nno more than you expected them to.\n\n186\n00:09:57.187 --> 00:10:01.162\nSo that's a good rule of thumb for just\nabout everything you do in this business.\n\n187\n00:10:01.162 --> 00:10:04.107\n>> [LAUGH] You do wanna be careful\non these just like what Daniel said.\n\n188\n00:10:04.107 --> 00:10:08.747\nThe key here is not to say,\nI believe $50,000 is a all I need.\n\n189\n00:10:08.747 --> 00:10:10.557\nYou wanna say, I'm gonna estimate.\n\n190\n00:10:10.557 --> 00:10:14.690\nIn other words,\nemphasize that this is an estimate\n\n191\n00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:19.210\nof what you believe is\ngoing to happen right now.\n\n192\n00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:24.580\nSo if you emphasize a particular figure,\nthey will hold you to that figure.\n\n193\n00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.370\nI guarantee you.\n\n194\n00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.020\nThey're gonna draw the line and\ngo, that's his upper limit.\n\n195\n00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.140\nThat's Ronnie's upper limit.\n\n196\n00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.310\nThat's Daniel's upper limit, Daniel comes\nback, goes, I think it's gonna be 575,\n\n197\n00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:39.440\nand now they're gonna say is wow Daniel,\nno way.\n\n198\n00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.830\nBut you emphasize that what\nI'm telling you right now\n\n199\n00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.860\nis the idea that I'm estimating this.\n\n200\n00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.780\nI believe that we need to make this\nidea of this control limit here.\n\n201\n00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:53.491\nIn other words give me leeway, give me\nthe ability to spend ten percent more or\n\n202\n00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:57.190\nfive percent more of whatever it is,\nwithout having to come and\n\n203\n00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:59.850\nfigure out what do we need to\ndo to get back on the project,\n\n204\n00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.340\ncuz you know it's gonna be variations\ncuz you haven't done anything.\n\n205\n00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.620\nBut this does lead to the point, and what\nDaniel's talking about is, that before\n\n206\n00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.700\nwe can do that then, before we can\nactually implement something like this,\n\n207\n00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.200\nwe need to come up with an estimate\nsomehow and plan it out as well.\n\n208\n00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.500\nSo, when we start talking\nabout then planning for\n\n209\n00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.790\nthe cost of our overall project.\n\n210\n00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.200\nWe do, because we have\nnothing else to base this on,\n\n211\n00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.360\nnot a lot of hard data at this point.\n\n212\n00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.290\nWe can come up with some estimates, right?\n\n213\n00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.630\nAn estimate, a lot of times is\nnot based on any real hard fact,\n\n214\n00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.370\nit's based on guesses a lot of times.\n\n215\n00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.550\n>> So remember that there\nare different methods and\n\n216\n00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.780\ntechniques that you can\ndo to help you out.\n\n217\n00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.980\nNow we already went over\nsome of these techniques but\n\n218\n00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.280\nwe are going to review them again.\n\n219\n00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.520\nWe've talked about the idea of top down,\nor analogous estimations.\n\n220\n00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.850\nWe've also talked about parametric.\n\n221\n00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:52.200\nAnd then this time we're also going\nto introduce one more new term\n\n222\n00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.200\nthat we haven't seen before in other\nareas of our series before as well.\n\n223\n00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.750\nSo when we talk about trying to develop\ncost estimates here, let's take a look at\n\n224\n00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:06.660\nthese three and we'll kinda zoom in and\ntry and focus in on just a couple of them.\n\n225\n00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.000\nIn terms of the top down estimation,\nright?\n\n226\n00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.770\nRemember what we're coming up with\nhere is the idea of an approximation.\n\n227\n00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:17.550\n>> And the way that we do this is that\nwe base it on previous projects that may\n\n228\n00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:21.897\nexist out there, that are the same size\nand scope, same number of work packages,\n\n229\n00:12:21.897 --> 00:12:26.330\nand that we believe that this is actually\na fair analogy to be able to make.\n\n230\n00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:30.740\nThis gives us what we call the order\nof magnitude, if I can actually do it,\n\n231\n00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:34.570\norder of magnitude type of estimation.\n\n232\n00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.210\nAnd that means based on\na project the same scale and\n\n233\n00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:41.940\nsame size about the same number of\nwork packages that are out there,\n\n234\n00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:47.160\nthat we believe that this does apply and\nthat we can use this as a decent analogy.\n\n235\n00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.130\nThe problem is we can't do it on\na work by work package basis because\n\n236\n00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.700\neven though the work package\nmay take eight days over there,\n\n237\n00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.470\nyou maybe manufacturing\nblue jeans on my side.\n\n238\n00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.430\nAnd maybe that I'm manufacturing tires,\nI don't know.\n\n239\n00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:00.000\nOkay?\n\n240\n00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.260\nSo those are two totally different\nprojects even thought those two products\n\n241\n00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.690\nmight take eight days in existence.\n\n242\n00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:09.370\nSo a lot of times if you're doing\nan analogist type or top down type of\n\n243\n00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:13.380\nestimation for your entire project,\nIt actually applies to the entire project.\n\n244\n00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.970\nThis gives you an overall,\ngeneral, big picture view.\n\n245\n00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:18.860\nBut it's not something that is good for\ngeneral work packages,\n\n246\n00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.900\nindividual work packages here.\n\n247\n00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.580\nYou've also gotta remember that\nthis is the least accurate of\n\n248\n00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:28.870\nall of the ones that we have available\nto us to get an estimation of, but\n\n249\n00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:33.258\nat the same time, it has the pro\nhere of being the least costly, why?\n\n250\n00:13:33.258 --> 00:13:36.200\nBecause you're essentially taking a look\nat another project and you're saying well\n\n251\n00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:41.924\nthat type of project took about 45\ndays and you know, and $52.000.\n\n252\n00:13:41.924 --> 00:13:45.880\nMy project let's say,\nlooks about the same size and scope.\n\n253\n00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.890\nI am gonna say we take 45 days and\nwe'll say $55,000 as well.\n\n254\n00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.890\nSo you can do something like that\nif you want to, but remember,\n\n255\n00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.370\nthat's really not incredibly\naccurate to do so.\n\n256\n00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:59.270\nBut is it a fair analogy to\nmake as far as size goes and\n\n257\n00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:00.450\nmaybe number of work packages?\n\n258\n00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.610\nMaybe.\n\n259\n00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:05.670\nBut at the same time, it doesn't actually\ngive you the apples to apples here.\n\n260\n00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.760\nIt gives you an apples to oranges\ntype of appearance as well.\n\n261\n00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.320\nLeast costly because you're not having\nto do any of the work to generate\n\n262\n00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.430\ndata that proves your\nestimates that come about.\n\n263\n00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:20.260\nSo remember that this estimate is\nnot based on any project data, and\n\n264\n00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.500\nonce again this is where we have to be\nvery honest with our stakeholders as\n\n265\n00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.880\nwe're planning this.\n\n266\n00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.010\nThis is not based on any data.\n\n267\n00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:31.790\nYou can't lead them to believe that\nif you're gonna a top down estimate.\n\n268\n00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.040\nYou have to say,\nbased on a project of the same size and\n\n269\n00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.110\nthe same scope and such,\nthen yes I believe it's gonna cost this.\n\n270\n00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.050\nBut you say it's an estimate.\n\n271\n00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:48.330\nYou do not tell them it will cost $50,000,\ncuz they will hold your line to that.\n\n272\n00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.320\nAnd all of a sudden you realize, after you\nactually finish a real estimation based on\n\n273\n00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.520\nsome data, you might find out\nit cost you $60,000 instead.\n\n274\n00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:02.330\nAnd now you're in trouble trying to find\nfunding for the rest of that project.\n\n275\n00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:02.960\nOkay?\n\n276\n00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.530\nSo that's one of the ways that we do it.\n\n277\n00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.870\nNow, is that a great estimation?\n\n278\n00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:10.510\nWhen you're at the very beginning\nof planning your project scope,\n\n279\n00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.040\nawesome way, okay?\n\n280\n00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.660\nBecause you can at least say that, right?\n\n281\n00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.810\nThat, hey, this is an estimation\nbased on something like this.\n\n282\n00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:21.510\nBut then, as you come to this\nplanning stage, it's not one that you\n\n283\n00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:26.240\nreally want to use for any hard data\nthat you want to give to anybody else,\n\n284\n00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:30.590\nthat's gonna be making any real\ndecisions on your project, okay?\n\n285\n00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:31.800\nNow, the other one, of course,\n\n286\n00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.060\nis the parametric type of estimation,\nas well, okay?\n\n287\n00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.220\nNow the nice thing about his one.\n\n288\n00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.930\nIt is based on a mathematical model,\nwhich is great.\n\n289\n00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:41.730\nIt's something that we really want to do.\n\n290\n00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:46.320\nAnd the basic formula is really kind of\nsomething that anybody can do, right?\n\n291\n00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:51.528\nYou go ahead and you add up the number of\nhours of work that you have to do, okay?\n\n292\n00:15:51.528 --> 00:15:55.371\nSo let's say that you actually went\nthrough all your work packages, and\n\n293\n00:15:55.371 --> 00:16:00.048\nyou realize that hey, this project's\ngonna take, let's say, 500 hours of work.\n\n294\n00:16:00.048 --> 00:16:03.553\nWell that gives you what you\nneed as far as the quantity of\n\n295\n00:16:03.553 --> 00:16:05.850\nwork that you want, okay.\n\n296\n00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:09.710\nThe problem that we really have\nhere is the idea of rate, okay.\n\n297\n00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:14.040\nAnd the rate is how much is every\nhour of work really going to cost?\n\n298\n00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.970\nWell, remember that in a real project,\nright,\n\n299\n00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:19.420\nthat can vary depending on\nwho's working on the project.\n\n300\n00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.920\nAnd also what equipment is also\nneeded on the project as well,\n\n301\n00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.760\nlet's say that Daniel says I'll come in\nas a contractor, but for $25 an hour.\n\n302\n00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.350\nWell that's different then if I\nsaid hey Mike will you do this?\n\n303\n00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.720\nAnd he says let's say $10 an hour okay?\n\n304\n00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:40.520\nSo this one does require a bit more\naccurate data if you're going to do this.\n\n305\n00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.230\nThe more accurate you are with\nthe data that you have,\n\n306\n00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:48.310\nthe better your parametric\nestimation is going to be.\n\n307\n00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:51.320\nThe other thing of course,\nabout the parametric estimation is that\n\n308\n00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.890\nthere are tons of models based\non the different industry or\n\n309\n00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.960\nwhatever product that\nyou're trying to create.\n\n310\n00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.110\nIt's very important that you use whatever\naccurate model that they have for\n\n311\n00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.260\nyou to follow to do so.\n\n312\n00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.260\nIf you do one and you're saying,\nI'm gonna base it on this.\n\n313\n00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.610\nAnd it's based on construction, and\n\n314\n00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:10.140\nyou're not doing anything in\nconstruction can you still use it?\n\n315\n00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:13.060\nPossibly but you're gonna find\nyourself having to do a lot of\n\n316\n00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:17.530\nmental gymnastics to get it to fit\nwhatever your situation is gonna be, okay?\n\n317\n00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.530\nSo that is one that can\nactually work as well.\n\n318\n00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:26.140\nIf you need a quick estimation\nbased on some general facts,\n\n319\n00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.940\nyou can give them a blanket type\nof estimation to do so, okay?\n\n320\n00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.220\nBut if you want the most\naccurate way that we can do so\n\n321\n00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.130\nat least according to\nthe compt of project plus,\n\n322\n00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:43.060\nwhat we're now talking about is called\na bottom up estimation and step, okay.\n\n323\n00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:47.200\nThe bottom up estimation type\nis actually the most precise\n\n324\n00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:52.030\nmodeling that we can do for the money\nthat we're gonna end up spending, okay.\n\n325\n00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.330\nSo this actually allow\nthe system to do it this way.\n\n326\n00:17:55.330 --> 00:18:00.000\nWe take every single work package and\nwe go ahead and we assign the cost for\n\n327\n00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.530\nevery work package.\n\n328\n00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:03.940\nAnd as we take the time to break it down.\n\n329\n00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.080\nIf Daniel and two other people are gonna\nwork on it, we find out their rates,\n\n330\n00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.500\nwe find out how much time is gonna take,\nand we literally break it down.\n\n331\n00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:14.310\nWe try and find out as much\ninformation we figured all that out.\n\n332\n00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.580\nWe do that for every single work\npackage in our project, for\n\n333\n00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.070\nus to come up with a total estimation.\n\n334\n00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.980\nWhat do we do?\n\n335\n00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:23.200\nWe take all those estimates and\nwe add them all up.\n\n336\n00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.180\nAnd in theory, that really does\ngive you as accurate as you can,\n\n337\n00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.940\nbased on the information\nthat you're given for\n\n338\n00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:33.150\nevery single work package\nthe entire total estimation.\n\n339\n00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:36.730\nSo that is actually where we get\na total estimate that we can do that.\n\n340\n00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:40.690\nNow notice it does require\na considerable amount of work and data.\n\n341\n00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:42.200\nAnd that is the key for us too.\n\n342\n00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.540\nAll right, so notice that this does\ntake a considerable amount of data.\n\n343\n00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.580\nNow what I mean by that is that this means\nthat you've already done all the work for\n\n344\n00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.840\nplanning out your work break down\nstructure hopefully you've actually\n\n345\n00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:57.550\ndone that already, and then to take a look\nat the resource requirements as well.\n\n346\n00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:59.620\nMaking sure that you have\nthe resource register,\n\n347\n00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.250\nand everything is actually there, and that\nyou're able to do something like this.\n\n348\n00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:04.760\nThis is not for the faint of heart.\n\n349\n00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.600\nIt's not something that can\nactually be done very quickly.\n\n350\n00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.110\nIt's something that in which people\nhave actually planned out for,\n\n351\n00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:11.940\nthey actually take the time to do it.\n\n352\n00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.315\nThe other thing that you have to worry\nabout when you do something like this\n\n353\n00:19:15.315 --> 00:19:20.490\nbottom-up estimation is,\nis the work package effort-driven.\n\n354\n00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.020\nNow this is a weird term.\n\n355\n00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:27.120\nThis is one of those project management\nterms that drives everybody nuts here\n\n356\n00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.100\nwhen we start talking about this.\n\n357\n00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.350\nSo what am I saying here?\n\n358\n00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:34.280\nA work package,\nlet's say we might go ahead and\n\n359\n00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.380\ngo look, here's what the cost is.\n\n360\n00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.870\nI've assigned Daniel and\ntwo other people to work on it, okay?\n\n361\n00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:44.280\nNow, we need to determine, and this is\nwhere it comes down to you going to talk\n\n362\n00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:50.000\nto whoever actually is on the work package\nto determine if adding a third person or\n\n363\n00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.630\na fourth person or\nwhatever resource in there we need to,\n\n364\n00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:57.670\nif that will shorten the duration\nof that work package, okay?\n\n365\n00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:01.790\nIf it is considered effort driven, it will\nshorten the duration of that work package.\n\n366\n00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:05.530\nBut you end up paying more for the\nresources, but you end up gaining time.\n\n367\n00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:09.980\nWhich essentially ends up saving money\nat the end of the project, at times.\n\n368\n00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.390\nWhen you end up let's say, saving a day.\n\n369\n00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:12.960\nAnd you might go, well why?\n\n370\n00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.250\nIf I added another person for\nDaniels work package.\n\n371\n00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.350\nAnd that ended up driving up the cost for\nhis work package, but\n\n372\n00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:24.070\nif I was able to save a day in the end\nresult, right, there's a lot of\n\n373\n00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:28.450\npeople that might have gotten paid on that\nextra day that now don't get paid on that\n\n374\n00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:32.550\nextra day because we were able to\nshorten the entire project up by a day.\n\n375\n00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.820\nSo that's why we have to also\ndetermine stuff like this\n\n376\n00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.740\nif we're going to be very accurate\nat doing this as well, okay?\n\n377\n00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.790\nAnd then like I said,\n\n378\n00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:42.620\nyou also have to figure out what\nthe appropriate rates are going to be.\n\n379\n00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:47.230\nNow you might at this point, if you're\nlike me, like my gosh, there is no way.\n\n380\n00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.690\nThat's a bunch of stuff you\nhave to juggle in the air.\n\n381\n00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:54.270\nThis is where those project management\ninformation systems kick in and\n\n382\n00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:56.010\nhelp you out tremendously.\n\n383\n00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:59.670\nThe reason why is that they're designed\nto be software that does exactly this.\n\n384\n00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:02.530\nYou don't have to actually give them every\nsingle detail but if you will give them\n\n385\n00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:07.190\nenough, they will provide for\nyou this type of bottom-up estimation.\n\n386\n00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:09.980\nNow then you can say I\nwant to go to report and\n\n387\n00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.480\nI want a report based on\nbudget estimates here.\n\n388\n00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.180\nAnd then it will actually\ndetermine that for\n\n389\n00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.690\nyou if you get enough\ninformation entered in.\n\n390\n00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:19.280\nAnd it can actually show you.\n\n391\n00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:23.140\nLike in Microsoft Project, for example, if\nyou know that this is one of those tasks,\n\n392\n00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.560\nyou simply just put a check\nmark that says effort driven.\n\n393\n00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.550\nWhich now allows you then when you add in\n\n394\n00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:32.400\na new resource into Daniel's\nwork package there.\n\n395\n00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.180\nIf that ends up happening, it knows how to\nactually readjust all the scales for that,\n\n396\n00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.660\nand it gives you a better\nestimate as well.\n\n397\n00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.440\nSo, if you actually wanted\nto know the recommendations,\n\n398\n00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.400\neven though there's plenty,\nlet me see if I can zoom back out here.\n\n399\n00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.810\nIf you wanna actually know\nof all three of these,\n\n400\n00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:51.020\nthey're gonna actually say\nthe bottom up is gonna be the one\n\n401\n00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:55.440\nthat you really wanna focus in on,\nif you have all of the material.\n\n402\n00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.770\nRemember at the very beginning when\nyou don't have anything base off,\n\n403\n00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:00.360\nof, make sure you actually understand\nyou're gonna do the top down.\n\n404\n00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.840\nIf you have some information,\n\n405\n00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.560\nyou're just trying to get a general\nfigure parametric will do for you.\n\n406\n00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.366\nSo you wanna make sure that everybody\nthat's gonna help you in planning this,\n\n407\n00:22:10.366 --> 00:22:12.910\nat least understand\nthose three methods and\n\n408\n00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:16.660\na lot of times at least make sure you\ngo through part of your project, with\n\n409\n00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:20.550\nall three of the methods to figure out\nwhich one you're gonna determined as well.\n\n410\n00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.500\nMost of the time, you're probably gonna\nend up doing this first two if you don't\n\n411\n00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:27.660\nreally have any data at all as long as you\nactually have somebody that's really good\n\n412\n00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:30.560\nat actually working out everything,\nkeeping track of that\n\n413\n00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.830\nproject management information system,\nthat bottom-up is probably going to give\n\n414\n00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:37.720\nyou as close of an accurate\nestimate as you possibly can here.\n\n415\n00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.320\n>> Yeah Ronnie, that bottom up approach is\ndefinitely the most precise and the best\n\n416\n00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.310\nway to go if you can get away with it\nthat's where you want to go because.\n\n417\n00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:45.420\nIt's gonna save you a lot of time,\n\n418\n00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.970\na lot of effort on the back\nend as the output comes.\n\n419\n00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:52.930\nIt does take a lot more\neffort on the front end, but\n\n420\n00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:57.160\nit's totally worth it for\nthe return on that time investment.\n\n421\n00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.920\nAnd that being said Ronnie, we'd be remiss\nif we didn't discuss the budget, right?\n\n422\n00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.100\nThat's gonna come down to budget\nmeetings are always so much fun.\n\n423\n00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.280\nI've been a part of plenty of them.\n\n424\n00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.420\nAnd where are we gonna allocate funds?\n\n425\n00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.170\nHow much do we need to\nallocate to this and to that?\n\n426\n00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:14.080\nThey're just part of any\ncost management plan, and\n\n427\n00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.840\nany budgeting plan that you're gonna have.\n\n428\n00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.440\nAll projects have this.\n\n429\n00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.570\n>> They do, and\nyou're a better man that I am to sit in on\n\n430\n00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:23.900\non a lot of these different ones' that\nare actually out there and available but\n\n431\n00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.990\nbudgeting is where really\nit comes down to, right?\n\n432\n00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:30.260\nHaving the estimate, in order words,\ngetting what you believe is the proper\n\n433\n00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:34.700\namount of funding that you need for your\nproject is based on those estimates but\n\n434\n00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:38.110\nthis is where we talked about at the very\nbeginning of the episode, right?\n\n435\n00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:40.920\nIf I am told I have $25,000\n\n436\n00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:45.630\nI need to make sure that I assign\nthe appropriate amount of money,\n\n437\n00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:50.740\nof resources, whatever it is, to every\ntask to insure that those tasks get done.\n\n438\n00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.798\nA budget essentially helps us\nto do those two things right?\n\n439\n00:23:53.798 --> 00:23:55.708\nActually helps to do two things,\nexcuse me.\n\n440\n00:23:55.708 --> 00:23:59.698\nOne of course is assign a cost to\nwhatever activity that we have, okay?\n\n441\n00:23:59.698 --> 00:24:02.884\nSo we're actually saying hey, we believe\nthat this is gonna cost us this much, and\n\n442\n00:24:02.884 --> 00:24:04.670\nwe go ahead and we assign that.\n\n443\n00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:07.470\nSecondly, a budget actually\ngives us the authorization, or\n\n444\n00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:09.460\nactually provides authorization for\nus, too.\n\n445\n00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:12.960\nAnd that sets that idea of control limits\nthat we were talking about at the very\n\n446\n00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.400\nbeginning, as well.\n\n447\n00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:18.000\nSo let's say that what ends up happening\nhere is that Daniel is gonna work on\n\n448\n00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.630\nthe networking clause, just as an example.\n\n449\n00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:25.538\nAnd we set aside the budget for that\nparticular phase of the project to be,\n\n450\n00:24:25.538 --> 00:24:28.330\nlet's say $5,000.\n\n451\n00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:31.830\nPerfectly fine if we do that.\n\n452\n00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:35.390\nNow, when I do that,\nI'm kind of saying here it is, okay.\n\n453\n00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:39.970\nDaniel is actually now authorized,\nonce the budget actually gets accepted and\n\n454\n00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:41.030\neverything else.\n\n455\n00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:41.810\nHe's authorized to be\n\n456\n00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:44.720\nable to spend that without having\nto come to me again as well.\n\n457\n00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.600\nSo that's why it actually provides\nnot only the assignment of cost\n\n458\n00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:53.250\nto that activity, it also now assigns\nthe ability to authorize that he\n\n459\n00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.240\ncan do that without having to worry\nabout coming back to us as well.\n\n460\n00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.420\nThe other thing that it also does,\nof course, when we start talking about\n\n461\n00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:05.040\nthe idea of the budget, is it helps us\nto go ahead and create a cost baseline.\n\n462\n00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.290\nSo let me show you my\ndiagram here to try and\n\n463\n00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:11.750\nhelp keep us on track\na little bit more too, okay?\n\n464\n00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.940\nSo, there we are, we're talking about\nthe very top down, the project budget.\n\n465\n00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.320\nIt really does help us do that.\n\n466\n00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:21.180\nThe idea of assigning cost and\nthen helping us to create a baseline\n\n467\n00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:25.100\ntype of cost for the entire project.\n\n468\n00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:29.440\nThat way we can see everything and we now\nsee where it breaks down and it goes.\n\n469\n00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:33.320\nThe other thing that we also normally\nneed, especially in a budget here,\n\n470\n00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.830\nwhen you're working with an accountant is,\nmore than likely, the accountant is going\n\n471\n00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:43.330\nto tell you how we wanna break\nthis down for accounting measures.\n\n472\n00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:44.278\nMost of the time,\n\n473\n00:25:44.278 --> 00:25:48.022\nthe accountant actually may provide\nsome type of accounting number.\n\n474\n00:25:48.022 --> 00:25:52.860\nAnd if you have a very formal project\nmanagement office, you also see that a lot\n\n475\n00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:57.844\nof times, this breaks down into your WBS\nnumbers as well, where every WBS number\n\n476\n00:25:57.844 --> 00:26:02.714\nis actually going to be assigned as being\na part of that accounting procedure.\n\n477\n00:26:02.714 --> 00:26:07.609\nSo that when Daniel actually does put\nin for release of funds for this and\n\n478\n00:26:07.609 --> 00:26:11.650\nthat, it actually gets tied\nto that number as well.\n\n479\n00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.650\nAnd that way, you're not actually\nhaving to write down, this is for\n\n480\n00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:16.990\nDaniel's project, or this work breakdown.\n\n481\n00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:20.310\nYou just assign that number to it, and\nit makes it easier for the accountant\n\n482\n00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:23.330\nto go ahead and be able to match those\nchecks up to do what we need to for\n\n483\n00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:24.545\nevery expense category.\n\n484\n00:26:24.545 --> 00:26:27.120\nWe'll have that available for us.\n\n485\n00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.670\nSo it makes it easy to track the money\nby doing something like this.\n\n486\n00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.215\nIt makes it easy for us to go ahead and\n\n487\n00:26:32.215 --> 00:26:35.500\nauthorize spending without having\nto do it for every single time.\n\n488\n00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.470\nGives a clear baseline\nof where we need to be.\n\n489\n00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:41.900\nNow along with that, once you actually\nhave all of those things assigned,\n\n490\n00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:46.340\nthere are two other components that we\ntend to actually have to worry about,\n\n491\n00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.958\nwhich is what we call our contingency and\nour management reserve.\n\n492\n00:26:50.958 --> 00:26:55.450\nNow In reality, a lot of projects and\n\n493\n00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:59.340\na lot of project managers will see these\nas actually being synonymous here.\n\n494\n00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:04.600\nContingency reserve, management reserve,\nthat they are one and the same.\n\n495\n00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.350\nIn the CompTia Project Plus,\nthey are not one and the same.\n\n496\n00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:11.380\nSo we need to make sure that we\nseparate out what the difference\n\n497\n00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:12.380\nis between these two.\n\n498\n00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:15.650\nAnd I've tried to delineate this for\nus so that we can keep this in our mind.\n\n499\n00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.780\nWhen you start talking about\na contingency reserve,\n\n500\n00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:25.670\nwhat you're saying here, is that\nfunds that are set aside to cover for\n\n501\n00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:28.760\nunplanned expenses to the project itself.\n\n502\n00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:33.850\nNow, that doesn't actually mean for\nanything that we want it to.\n\n503\n00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:38.730\nThe contingency is not set\nthere because now at the end,\n\n504\n00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.880\nI've still got,\nlet's say $10,000 in the contingency.\n\n505\n00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.760\nIt's now time for\nme to think about a big blow out party for\n\n506\n00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.840\nthe entire project team.\n\n507\n00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.120\nThat's not what the contingency's about.\n\n508\n00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.460\nCan people use it for that?\n\n509\n00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.140\nDo people?\n\n510\n00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.790\nProbably, but\nthat's not what we're talking about.\n\n511\n00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.100\nSo usually what ends up happening here,\n\n512\n00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:00.380\nis that it's not really supposed to be\na source of extra money for the project.\n\n513\n00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.890\nIt is for those unplanned expenses that\nend up happening to every single project\n\n514\n00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:09.540\nhere, that we just don't have\nany way to actually go look.\n\n515\n00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:13.070\nWe didn't know that it was gonna\ncost this, to help us out.\n\n516\n00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:17.260\nNow, the nice thing about it is that\nthe authorization of the spending list\n\n517\n00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.390\ncomes directly from the project manager.\n\n518\n00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:25.630\nSo he actually has put aside a set of the\nfunds here, a certain amount of funding.\n\n519\n00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:30.370\nUsually it's a percentage of\nthe overall project cost, say,\n\n520\n00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:34.070\nthis is actually set aside for\nthings that we cannot plan for.\n\n521\n00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.450\nYou just have to set that aside.\n\n522\n00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.360\nNow, do you have to use it?\n\n523\n00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.690\nNo, but if you don't use it,\nit's not again, free money.\n\n524\n00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:44.900\nIt doesn't mean I'll just use it here.\n\n525\n00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:45.530\nI'll just use it here.\n\n526\n00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:50.240\nIt is up to the discretion of the project\nmanager, but whatever you actually earmark\n\n527\n00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:54.170\nthat contingency to be, whether it's\nemergencies only, and you can do that.\n\n528\n00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:55.000\n>> It's an insurance policy.\n\n529\n00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.710\n>> Yeah, it is an insurance policy, yeah.\n\n530\n00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:59.800\nAnd so whatever you actually set up,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n531\n00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.930\nBut notice they actually have\nmanagement reserve down here instead.\n\n532\n00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:07.910\nFunds set aside to cover for\nunforseen situations.\n\n533\n00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:10.670\nNow the first one I talked\nabout is unplanned expenses.\n\n534\n00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:13.390\nNow there's things we\njust didn't plan for.\n\n535\n00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:15.820\nBut unforseen things is more\n\n536\n00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:19.790\nkind of the very basics of\nthe insurance policy, again.\n\n537\n00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:23.342\nBut this one, though,\nis a little bit different.\n\n538\n00:29:23.342 --> 00:29:27.426\nIt's different in this way, in that even\nthough the project manager knows it's\n\n539\n00:29:27.426 --> 00:29:31.585\nthere and it's a percentage of the overall\ntotal cost, he doesn't get to use it.\n\n540\n00:29:31.585 --> 00:29:33.340\nHe doesn't get to.\n\n541\n00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:36.320\nHe gets to request the use of this.\n\n542\n00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:40.790\nIf he happens to actually go beyond\nwhat he thinks is gonna happen.\n\n543\n00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.620\nSomething unplanned happened here, and\n\n544\n00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.510\nit's not inside of his\nbudget at this point.\n\n545\n00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.500\nHe can then go to management and\n\n546\n00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:52.740\nactually request access to the management\nreserve here for his project,\n\n547\n00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:55.680\nbut he has to get authorization and\napproval for that as well.\n\n548\n00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:01.920\nSo a lot of times the management reserve\nis not actually part of the budget itself,\n\n549\n00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.390\nwhereas the contingency reserve\nis a part of the budget.\n\n550\n00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:08.380\nBut this is actually kind\nof the key difference here.\n\n551\n00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:12.140\nIs one, the project manager is not in\ncontrol of the management reserve.\n\n552\n00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.820\nHe has to request it and he has to be\nauthorized to be able to spend it here.\n\n553\n00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.590\nAnd then,\nthis is not a part of the budget.\n\n554\n00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:21.710\nContingency, though,\nunforseen things happen,\n\n555\n00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:24.530\nthings cost more than we\nexpected them to happen.\n\n556\n00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:28.110\nThe project manager has at his\ndiscretion whatever that contingency is\n\n557\n00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:29.950\nto be able to cover for those things.\n\n558\n00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.330\nHe does not have it as the ability to go,\n\n559\n00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:35.540\nlet me just add this onto\nthe project because I felt like it.\n\n560\n00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.930\nAt least,\nthat's the way it's supposed to be.\n\n561\n00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:41.240\nIn reality, most project managers would\nprobably consider both of them as being\n\n562\n00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.350\none in the same.\n\n563\n00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:43.860\nBut that's the big difference here.\n\n564\n00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:46.560\nWho authorizes it and\nwho doesn't get authorization for it?\n\n565\n00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.480\nAnd what is its intended purpose?\n\n566\n00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.722\nSo that's also gonna be a part of\nplanning for your budget as well.\n\n567\n00:30:53.722 --> 00:30:57.684\nAnd then the last thing that we wanna\nmention here is the idea of the baselines.\n\n568\n00:30:57.684 --> 00:31:02.353\nLet me scroll this down, and I guess I can\nactually increase the font, just a little\n\n569\n00:31:02.353 --> 00:31:07.600\nbit more, so that we can see it here, is\nthat cost baseline that we talked about.\n\n570\n00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.930\nRemember that we just need to make\nsure that we understand that there is\n\n571\n00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:13.600\na baseline that we've gotta set up\nbefore any of this stuff happens.\n\n572\n00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.010\nSo total approved expected cost should\nbe set before any work is ever done.\n\n573\n00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:20.170\nWe don't start it without\nthis cost baseline.\n\n574\n00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:21.470\nYou don't do that.\n\n575\n00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:24.660\nEven when you actually begin to\nmake your project management\n\n576\n00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.470\nplan inside of your project\ninformation system.\n\n577\n00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:29.560\nOne of the early things you might\nset up is the cost baseline,\n\n578\n00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.740\nwhat you actually believe.\n\n579\n00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:33.810\nAnd then we'll start actually\nreducing the amount of money and\n\n580\n00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:35.990\nactually show you where\nyou are in your budget.\n\n581\n00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:38.750\nYou also wanna make sure that\nyou include any variances and\n\n582\n00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:42.580\nexpenses, because that all will be\nmeasured against that cost baseline.\n\n583\n00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:46.460\nAnd this one will actually tell you\nagain where it's tracked in comparison.\n\n584\n00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:49.280\nSo let's show you when the money's\nactually released as well,\n\n585\n00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.670\nagainst that baseline.\n\n586\n00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:55.630\nSo this is our first major kind\nof milestone type of point for\n\n587\n00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.100\ncost that we have, and\n\n588\n00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:02.150\nit needs to be set up before anything ever\nhappens on our budget planning as well.\n\n589\n00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:06.310\nSo when we start taking a look at\nthe components of a project cost\n\n590\n00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:10.980\nmanagement plan, those are the major\ncomponents that you have to deal with.\n\n591\n00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:15.160\nIs there much more in-depth information\non this stuff you should go to?\n\n592\n00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:15.920\nBeyond, right?\n\n593\n00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.410\nYou can take full accounting courses,\nand of course, budget and\n\n594\n00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:23.600\nmanagement courses that will\njust take you to the nth degree.\n\n595\n00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.360\nWe just did a high level review, wanna\nmake sure that you knew what was normally\n\n596\n00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.690\ninvolved inside of the project plan here.\n\n597\n00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:31.850\n>> Well Ronnie, I think if I learned\nanything from today's episode,\n\n598\n00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:36.094\nit's that cost management and creating a\ncost management plan is not child's play.\n\n599\n00:32:36.094 --> 00:32:36.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n600\n00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:39.420\nit's extremely important to the project.\n\n601\n00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.210\nWhy?\nWell this is the money right?\n\n602\n00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:43.530\nThis is really what it comes down to,\nthe brass tacks,\n\n603\n00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:45.570\nas we like to say here in the US.\n\n604\n00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:47.960\nWhat is it gonna cost me\nto get this thing up and\n\n605\n00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.882\nrunning, off the ground and wheels up?\n\n606\n00:32:49.882 --> 00:32:51.940\nRonnie, but\nyou've done a great job, I believe,\n\n607\n00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:56.790\nof explaining at least, like you said, the\ngeneral overview of how we can do this and\n\n608\n00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:00.190\nwhat goes into setting up\nthat cost management plan.\n\n609\n00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:01.150\nAnd we really appreciate it.\n\n610\n00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:04.430\nThank you for stopping by, and everybody\nout there, thank you for watching.\n\n611\n00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:06.190\nWe hope you got a lot out\nof today's episode, but\n\n612\n00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:08.110\nas of right now we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off.\n\n613\n00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:10.411\nFor ITProTV,\nI've

another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.482\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n5\n00:00:18.482 --> 00:00:21.439\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our Project+ series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.893\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nis none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:24.893 --> 00:00:26.420\nRonnie, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.970\n>> Well, thank you for\n\n9\n00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.430\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\non to take a look at CompTIA's Project+.\n\n10\n00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.660\nWhat we're actually doing today is we're\ngonna be taking a look at what we call\n\n11\n00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.500\nplanning project procurement on,\nof course, Project+,\n\n12\n00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.630\nwhich is a lot of P's we were making\na little bit of a joke about that.\n\n13\n00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.720\nMy alliteration was not\nexactly the best thing today.\n\n14\n00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.540\nBut we are taking a look at what\nwe call planning for procurement.\n\n15\n00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.089\nNow when we start talking about\nthe idea of project procurement,\n\n16\n00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.713\nwhat are we really trying to figure\nout and what are we trying to do?\n\n17\n00:00:55.713 --> 00:00:58.400\nWell, just like it says,\nit talks about procurement here.\n\n18\n00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.624\nBut what we're talking about really is\nwhat happens outside of our organization\n\n19\n00:01:02.624 --> 00:01:04.747\nwhen we need to pull those resources in.\n\n20\n00:01:04.747 --> 00:01:09.030\nWell, we need to have some standard way\nto actually procure those resources.\n\n21\n00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.230\nI know that it seems like a great\nway to work when you watch TV and\n\n22\n00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.770\nsomebody says, this is what we need done.\n\n23\n00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.810\nAnd the guy just looks over and\ngoes, I know a guy, okay?\n\n24\n00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.980\nI know a guy and he can get it done.\n\n25\n00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.020\nAnd it's amazing and wonderful that on\nTV when he does that, everything's done,\n\n26\n00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.440\nthere's never any question about how\nit gets done, how much money it cost,\n\n27\n00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.580\nwhat contracts are there, how do they\nmake that selection to be appropriate.\n\n28\n00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.850\nIt just happens and it's wonderful.\n\n29\n00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.780\nIn the real world of project management,\nthough, it's seldom that easy.\n\n30\n00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.340\nEven the decision of whether or\n\n31\n00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.865\nnot to actually procure some type of\nservice from outside is not that easy.\n\n32\n00:01:48.865 --> 00:01:51.643\nSo usually there's two questions\nwe have to ask of whether or\n\n33\n00:01:51.643 --> 00:01:54.212\nnot we actually need\na Project Procurement Plan or not.\n\n34\n00:01:54.212 --> 00:01:58.651\nBut let's go ahead and look at my slide\nhere and my diagram, my simple diagram,\n\n35\n00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:02.210\nand let's make sure we\nunderstand those two questions.\n\n36\n00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.300\nHow in the world do I know if I\nneed a Project Procurement Plan?\n\n37\n00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.980\nIf my organization or my project team\ncannot do what needs to be done on\n\n38\n00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.200\nmy project, more than likely I\nhave to get it done somehow.\n\n39\n00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.070\nAnd that normally means I'm going\nto either outsource the actual\n\n40\n00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.990\nproject itself or that work package, or\nI'm going to actually provide training for\n\n41\n00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.410\nthat so\nthat somebody can actually get it done.\n\n42\n00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.030\nSo if I realize something, that if I\ntry and do the training for this, and\n\n43\n00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.290\nit's gonna actually take another four\nweeks in addition to what I have\n\n44\n00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.430\nplanned for that to be done,\nI may realize something, that I cannot\n\n45\n00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.960\nlose that valuable time of those four\nweeks for the additional training.\n\n46\n00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.720\nWhat I need to do is consider\nsome type of outsourcing,\n\n47\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.160\nsome type of expert to come in and\nbe able to do that.\n\n48\n00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.300\nNow if you absolutely realize that that's\nwhat's gonna have to happen at times\n\n49\n00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.322\non your project, then yes,\nyou need a Project Procurement Plan.\n\n50\n00:03:01.322 --> 00:03:05.530\nInside of your organization, though,\nif you have all the resources that\n\n51\n00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.930\nare available for you that absolutely\ncan do everything on your project,\n\n52\n00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.730\nthen you don't need\na Project Procurement Plan.\n\n53\n00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.250\nIf you're willing to spend\nthe extra money to go ahead and\n\n54\n00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.440\nget additional training for everybody\ninternal to do what they need to,\n\n55\n00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.370\nyou don't have to actually go outside\nto get the Project Procurement Plan.\n\n56\n00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.050\nAnd this is for the idea of human\nresources more than anything else.\n\n57\n00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.040\nThe other thing that may also end up\nhappening, and this has happened on\n\n58\n00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.849\nseveral projects before,\nnot on any one that I've ever worked on.\n\n59\n00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.541\nBut on several projects that I've\nactually read about here in which you\n\n60\n00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:43.070\nhave to ask this question.\n\n61\n00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.960\nDo I choose to make it or\ndo I choose to buy it?\n\n62\n00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.156\nYou might find out as you work on\na particular project that here's\n\n63\n00:03:51.156 --> 00:03:55.490\nsomething that is not in\nexistence in this hemisphere.\n\n64\n00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.390\nAnd that stuff does happen\nwhere they literally go, yeah,\n\n65\n00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.210\nthe only one that's actually in existence\nis over in Southeast Asia right now.\n\n66\n00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.970\nAnd so you have this chance to ask these\ntwo questions here, whatever the product\n\n67\n00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.970\nis, whatever it might be, that is there\na possibility that I can get that, or\n\n68\n00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.959\nI can buy that product and\nget it over here for my project?\n\n69\n00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.040\nOr can I make it?\n\n70\n00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.430\nSo it is very possible that you\nmight be able to spend the time and\n\n71\n00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.070\nthe resources to literally make\nthe product that doesn't exist so\n\n72\n00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.688\nthat you can get your project done,\nor are you going to buy it?\n\n73\n00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:35.930\nWell, if you choose to buy it, it means\nyou need a Project Procurement Plan.\n\n74\n00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.170\nSo think about it in this way.\n\n75\n00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.140\nAny time you reach outside of your\norganization to procure services or\n\n76\n00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.660\nresources so\nthat you can get your project done,\n\n77\n00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.010\nyou're gonna need some type\nof Project Procurement Plan,\n\n78\n00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.020\nis what you're gonna absolutely\nneed to make sure that you do.\n\n79\n00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.100\nNow the problem that we have again is,\nhow do we go about doing that\n\n80\n00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.540\nin a way that absolutely doesn't violate\nlaws in the place that you're in and\n\n81\n00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.915\ndoesn't seem like you actually only giving\nthe contract to your brother-in-law?\n\n82\n00:05:08.915 --> 00:05:12.020\n[LAUGH] Nepotism is what\nwe’re talking about.\n\n83\n00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.240\nThat you're only doing that,\nwhich people absolutely frown upon.\n\n84\n00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.020\nWell, the way that you do that\nis you come up with a plan and\n\n85\n00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.760\na process that seems what?\n\n86\n00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.190\nEqual, fair,\nobjective as much as possible,\n\n87\n00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.720\nto everybody that's actually\nlooking at your project.\n\n88\n00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.210\nAnd the way that that comes\nabout a lot of times,\n\n89\n00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.060\nthen, is by actually\nopening up the process.\n\n90\n00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.740\nYou might have heard about it,\nthe idea of considering bids for\n\n91\n00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.570\nyour project, having some type of bidder\nconference, whatever it might be.\n\n92\n00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.623\nBut everybody uses these terms\na little bit differently.\n\n93\n00:05:41.623 --> 00:05:46.040\nYou might hear the acronyms RFI, RFQ, RFP.\n\n94\n00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.960\nNow what do each of those stand for?\n\n95\n00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.426\nWell, RFI stands for\nrequest for the information.\n\n96\n00:05:54.426 --> 00:05:58.020\nI wanted to say inquiry, but\nit's request for information.\n\n97\n00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.630\nAnd then RFQ is a request for a quote.\n\n98\n00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.220\nRFP is a request for a proposal, is what\nwe're normally taking a look at when\n\n99\n00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.380\nwe start to talk about those\ndifferent ones that you see.\n\n100\n00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.132\nSo when we start talking about that,\nthis is what might happen,\n\n101\n00:06:13.132 --> 00:06:17.242\nis that you do submit some type of\nrequest out there in that community.\n\n102\n00:06:17.242 --> 00:06:21.420\nYou might do it through the trade papers\nthat are actually out there and available.\n\n103\n00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.220\nYou might actually do it just\nadvertising on the radio, on TV,\n\n104\n00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.580\nor whatever it might be.\n\n105\n00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.690\nBut you normally go through some type\nof channel in which you actually\n\n106\n00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.210\nput it out there in the community\nthat you're looking for\n\n107\n00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.070\nsomeone to be able to do\nwhat you have them to do.\n\n108\n00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.972\nYou're essentially putting out a request\nfor anyone that would like to consider\n\n109\n00:06:41.972 --> 00:06:46.741\nthis to come and see whether or not that\nyou're gonna procure their services.\n\n110\n00:06:46.741 --> 00:06:48.265\n>> Ronnie, quick question.\n\n111\n00:06:48.265 --> 00:06:52.852\nThe RFI, the RFQ, and the RFP, are they\nconsidered synonymous, or are they really\n\n112\n00:06:52.852 --> 00:06:57.256\nseparate things and they all kinda have\na pointed tip to them that's different?\n\n113\n00:06:57.256 --> 00:07:00.040\n>> [LAUGH] It depends on\nthe industry that you're in.\n\n114\n00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.470\nThat's the key, right?\n\n115\n00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.640\nSo in a very generic sense,\nthey all really mean the same thing, but\n\n116\n00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.670\nevery industry actually kind of\ncalls it something differently.\n\n117\n00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:12.490\nSo you might see in certain places\nwhere they say an RFI is this, and\n\n118\n00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.710\nthat's a formal thing for\nsomething like this.\n\n119\n00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.360\nAnd they may say a request for a quote is\na little bit different, and a request for\n\n120\n00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.320\na proposal is different as well.\n\n121\n00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.270\nSo it might be the quote is\nactually dealing with just money.\n\n122\n00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.570\nIt might be an information,\njust to see if you actually are out there.\n\n123\n00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.545\nIt's sort of like fishing.\n\n124\n00:07:27.545 --> 00:07:30.776\nYou kind of put a little bit of bait and\nsee if anybody bites, is the request for\n\n125\n00:07:30.776 --> 00:07:31.730\ninformation.\n\n126\n00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.300\nThe quote is actually saying all right,\nhere it is,\n\n127\n00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.980\nI'm willing to give this\nmuch money to do it.\n\n128\n00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.360\nThe proposal is to say\nI wanna see the layout,\n\n129\n00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.830\nI wanna see the outline of\neverything that you have.\n\n130\n00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.518\nBut a lot of times they can be synonymous,\ndepending on the industry that you're in.\n\n131\n00:07:45.518 --> 00:07:48.654\nSo in each of these you might\nend up including, of course,\n\n132\n00:07:48.654 --> 00:07:52.174\nyour statement of work for\nwhatever it is that they are to look at,\n\n133\n00:07:52.174 --> 00:07:54.610\nwhoever is actually out\nthere is looking at.\n\n134\n00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.968\nYou wanna make sure that\nthey understand the scope.\n\n135\n00:07:56.968 --> 00:07:59.278\nOf work that's actually to be done.\n\n136\n00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:03.277\nThey also need to be submitted in\na process that will be fairly uniform for\n\n137\n00:08:03.277 --> 00:08:08.132\neverybody that's actually going to submit\nfor this, there's a reason behind that and\n\n138\n00:08:08.132 --> 00:08:10.510\nwe'll talk about that in a moment, okay.\n\n139\n00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.000\nSo when I talk about how responses\nare to be formatted you may indicate\n\n140\n00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.340\na particular template that they are to\nfollow period, is what they're to do.\n\n141\n00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:23.300\nAnd then, a deadline for\nwhen the response is to come in.\n\n142\n00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:28.790\nYou may even indicate whether or not a\nformal presentation is to be made or not.\n\n143\n00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.210\nAnd maybe even indicate a bid for\nwhatever that is.\n\n144\n00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.030\nNow, you may not do that\nall at the same time.\n\n145\n00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.190\nWhat you may actually go ahead and\n\n146\n00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.800\ndo like we talked about here\nIs at the very beginning.\n\n147\n00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.750\nWe do a request for information.\n\n148\n00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.740\nWho actually wants to bid on this?\n\n149\n00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.750\nAnd then you ask for more information\nlike how big is your company?\n\n150\n00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.400\nCuz if I actually have a project that\nactually requires you to have let's say 4,\n\n151\n00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.390\n500 people, and\nyour particular construction team says,\n\n152\n00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.280\nwell, I've got three Well,\nI know something.\n\n153\n00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.350\nThat, even though you say,\nI think I can do this work,\n\n154\n00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.400\nI know I can get enough subcontractors.\n\n155\n00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.130\nI may not have the time to wait and\nsee if you can do it.\n\n156\n00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:08.090\nI may just go well, absolutely I'm not\ngonna actually accept this at all.\n\n157\n00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.470\nAnd that weeds that\nparticular process out.\n\n158\n00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.570\nBut you gotta actually\nfigure this out too.\n\n159\n00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:17.140\nNow, if the organization is normally\npublic funded a lot of times,\n\n160\n00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.200\nin other words, by the government,\nyou're not suppose to actually be,\n\n161\n00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.950\nyou know, in other words Daniel and\nI are not supposed to that\n\n162\n00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:25.860\nI love this company let me mark this for\nspecial inner marketer.\n\n163\n00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.920\nSo the idea of actually\nformatting it the same.\n\n164\n00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.370\nWe don't want to try and\nget everybody get dizzy here.\n\n165\n00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:34.320\nThe idea of actually formatting it exactly\nthe same makes what more difficult for\n\n166\n00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.280\nsomebody just look never decide here's\nto come Daniel want me to look at for\n\n167\n00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.420\nthey literally have to read the name or\n\n168\n00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.730\nthey may even submit it\nunder a bid number, right.\n\n169\n00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:47.170\nAn actual unique ID number,\nthat whoever the company, and\n\n170\n00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.210\nwhoever's making the decisions is\nrequiring, is that he just looks at that.\n\n171\n00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.640\nHe doesn't even look at the name.\n\n172\n00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.460\nHe just says bid number 412,\nor ID number 412 on this\n\n173\n00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.060\nproposal is the one that looks the best,\nhands it over to another one.\n\n174\n00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.900\nAnd they go 412 looks the best and\nit doesn't matter if Daniel actually\n\n175\n00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.950\nlikes the company or not, but if they're\nall formatted the same and they'll\n\n176\n00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.610\nall have to make that identification, well\nthen the people that are deciding this\n\n177\n00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.240\ndon't they get to choose it based on\nthe merits of what's being presented.\n\n178\n00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.930\nSo these are actually part of that\nprocess of getting everything in line.\n\n179\n00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.150\nOf who's actually going to be suitable for\n\n180\n00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:26.420\nwhat we're actually trying to procure and\nthat's the the key behind this as well.\n\n181\n00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.990\nYou want to make sure they\nhave the deadline and\n\n182\n00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.890\nthat you're not making\nthe decision before that deadline.\n\n183\n00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.230\nIf you're asking for\na formal presentation,\n\n184\n00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.910\nwell that now can skew\nthings a little bit more.\n\n185\n00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.420\nYou again outline the structure of what\nthe presentation should include and\n\n186\n00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.120\nwhat it shouldn't,\nwhen is it gonna happen.\n\n187\n00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.020\nAnd then, that way they can actually\ndo everything that you need.\n\n188\n00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.690\nBut not every process is the same.\n\n189\n00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:51.380\nBut just kind of realize that at least\nwhen you start talking about procurement,\n\n190\n00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.260\na lot of time some countries and\n\n191\n00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:57.620\ndepending on laws there, you may find\nout it's stricter than you think.\n\n192\n00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:58.560\nAnd you go, no,\n\n193\n00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.220\nI just gave it to cousin Larry cuz he\ndidn't have a job doing right now, and\n\n194\n00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.910\nit might as well be my cousin instead\nof somebody, a stranger, I don't know.\n\n195\n00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.530\nWell, all of a sudden you might find\nout that other people come in and\n\n196\n00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:13.010\nsay, that's not actually part of the way\nthat we do bidding processes around here.\n\n197\n00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.230\nYou gotta follow those laws as well.\n\n198\n00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.270\nSo this procurement process here,\nmay be a little bit more formalized and\n\n199\n00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:22.020\nregulated than you realize,\na lot of times, so\n\n200\n00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:27.870\njust be aware of that as you continue on\nin your project wherever you are, okay.\n\n201\n00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.200\nNow, once you get all that information in,\n\n202\n00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.340\nthat's where we talk about evaluating\nthe actual seller response here.\n\n203\n00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:41.160\nRemember that this is not supposed to be\nbased on fancy colors or who you know,\n\n204\n00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.640\nnepotism of some sort.\n\n205\n00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:48.270\nBut, it should be based on whatever\ncriteria that we absolutely set up\n\n206\n00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.050\nfor making decision.\n\n207\n00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.780\nJust like I said, if the company says,\nI've got a great construction company.\n\n208\n00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.850\nWe've been around for 15 years but\nI only have five people working for me.\n\n209\n00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:01.200\nYou need a construction company\nthat can absolutely do 500 people.\n\n210\n00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.910\nWell, it need you can't set it up.\n\n211\n00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.460\nThey don't need the criteria.\n\n212\n00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:09.870\nDon't even add them into that market to\ndo something like that as well, okay.\n\n213\n00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:13.460\nYou also need to be careful about who\nactually isn't part of this selection.\n\n214\n00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.740\nSo before you get everything in,\nyou go ahead and\n\n215\n00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:21.610\nyou decide who's gonna be part of this\nselection team that evaluates the actual\n\n216\n00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.210\nbidder information that\nyou're gonna have on hand.\n\n217\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.740\nAnd that way you're not loading\nit on one way or the other.\n\n218\n00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.860\nYou're just saying,\n\n219\n00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.470\nthis is who's going to be on it and\nhere's what we're going to do.\n\n220\n00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:36.490\nHere's our evaluation and\n\n221\n00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:40.860\nhere's our criteria to absolutely\nget us to this point that we need.\n\n222\n00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.660\nSo having that on hand, right,\n\n223\n00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.750\nis actually a big part of understanding\nthat it's not just that simple.\n\n224\n00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:50.480\nIt's not just saying, we need somebody to\ngo and just get us one because, remember,\n\n225\n00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.120\nthey still have to do all of the other\nthings that are required in our project.\n\n226\n00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.070\nWe want to make sure we get the right one,\nget the right bang for\n\n227\n00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.020\nthe buck that we have.\n\n228\n00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.890\n>> So, Ronnie, I'm taking a look at\nthe information you're giving us here and\n\n229\n00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:05.210\nis it more common for\nthe closed bid kind of environment or\n\n230\n00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:10.000\ndo we see a lot more of it's not what\nyou know but who you know kind of thing?\n\n231\n00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.700\n>> I am hoping that it's actually more\ncommon for it to be a closed bid,\n\n232\n00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.370\nbut you just never know, right?\n\n233\n00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:16.260\nAnd every industry and\n\n234\n00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:19.390\nevery part of the world it's going\nto be a little bit different.\n\n235\n00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.030\nIt depends on the size of\nthe contract as well, right?\n\n236\n00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:26.140\nBecause you can see why small companies\nfeel a little bit out bidded at times,\n\n237\n00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.230\nbecause they don't understand\nthe actual rules of it.\n\n238\n00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.840\nAnd so being able to do a closed\ntype of bid is easier for\n\n239\n00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.940\neverybody when they realize they have\na fair chance at getting that contract.\n\n240\n00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.150\nBut you just never know.\n\n241\n00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.730\nThat's what it comes down to.\n\n242\n00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.770\nIf you're used to an area that's\nalways bidding on contracts,\n\n243\n00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.500\nyou know what the rules of the game are,\nand that's the reality of it.\n\n244\n00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:51.020\nI'd love to say that there's\na standardized process for everyone and\n\n245\n00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.330\nthat you just follow that process and\n\n246\n00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.380\nyou're fine you're going to find\nout that it's never that easy.\n\n247\n00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.050\n>> Yeah you know, and\nI guess it begs the question, does that,\n\n248\n00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:03.920\nthe personality of the vendor,\nthe person that's representing\n\n249\n00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:08.260\nthat company as a vendor, does that\ncome into play in vendor selection?\n\n250\n00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.520\nShould it?\nI mean there is\n\n251\n00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.500\nprobably two schools of thought on this\nas there is on just about everything.\n\n252\n00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.530\nBut I would venture to say\n\n253\n00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:15.830\nthis isn't compIT stuff here-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n254\n00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.320\n>> This is us just musing really.\n\n255\n00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.340\nIs I would say yes.\n\n256\n00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.390\nI wanna look the man in the eye or\nthe woman in the eye and\n\n257\n00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:24.270\nsee that they have a confidence\nin the job that they can do.\n\n258\n00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:28.440\nAnd I think that that would play a role\nin my selection of them as vendor.\n\n259\n00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.170\nAs long as they do meet a certain\nseries of requirements or standards.\n\n260\n00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.890\n>> Yes, when it comes down to vendor\nselection which what we're really\n\n261\n00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.070\ngetting at here.\n\n262\n00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:39.330\nIt is kind of an unusual requirement here.\n\n263\n00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.930\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my diagram again.\n\n264\n00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:44.500\nSince Dan brought it up.\n\n265\n00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.630\nWe'll kind of focus on this as well.\n\n266\n00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.730\nVendor selection,\nshould it be absolutely, 100% objective?\n\n267\n00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.410\nWell, yeah, okay.\n\n268\n00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:57.820\nIn best of all possible worlds it\nshould be 100% objective here.\n\n269\n00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:02.220\nBut the very fact is there's always\na subjective element to it in certain ways\n\n270\n00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.460\nthat we can talk about, and\nwe'll hit that in our list too.\n\n271\n00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:10.280\nAnd also what if you already had\nprevious connections, and others,\n\n272\n00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:14.650\nlet's say even on another project where\nyou've work with a vendor before and\n\n273\n00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:18.650\nyou go, man, I trust their work, yes.\n\n274\n00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:22.530\nAll that really can come into play but\nyou again,\n\n275\n00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:26.490\nhave to pay attention to what the minimum\nrequirement or the criteria is.\n\n276\n00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:29.170\nIt might be that it does\ncome into play but for\n\n277\n00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:34.080\nthat company, it's $15,000 less, or more.\n\n278\n00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:40.830\nThey demanded $15,000 more than what you\nsaid that you could actually afford.\n\n279\n00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.730\nWell then, you have to make that decision.\n\n280\n00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:47.439\nDid you say now that's my top dollar,\nI can only do that,\n\n281\n00:15:47.439 --> 00:15:51.788\nWell that even cuts out your best\nvendor that you might see, okay.\n\n282\n00:15:51.788 --> 00:15:54.278\nSo let's take a look at these right away.\n\n283\n00:15:54.278 --> 00:15:58.769\nIn an objective way, right, when we talk\nabout vendor selection We should from\n\n284\n00:15:58.769 --> 00:16:02.256\nwhatever they come back with,\nwhatever the information is,\n\n285\n00:16:02.256 --> 00:16:06.479\nwe should be able to understand that\nthey have a solid understanding of what\n\n286\n00:16:06.479 --> 00:16:11.590\nthe requirements are going to be for what\nit is that we've asked them for, okay?\n\n287\n00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:15.950\nIf you get back some type of information,\nand you read it and\n\n288\n00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.670\nyou go they look like they don't\nunderstand the process at all,\n\n289\n00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:22.860\nwell then you know that maybe\nthey're not the one for you.\n\n290\n00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:27.068\nSo I had something like this just happen\nnot too long ago, where I was actually\n\n291\n00:16:27.068 --> 00:16:31.342\nworking for a project for a future show\nthat we're talking about, and we tried\n\n292\n00:16:31.342 --> 00:16:35.786\nto get a couple of different quotes about\nservers that we wanted to be on the show.\n\n293\n00:16:35.786 --> 00:16:40.111\nSo I reached out to a project manager\nyou know at a server company,\n\n294\n00:16:40.111 --> 00:16:42.879\nthat makes servers out there somewhere.\n\n295\n00:16:42.879 --> 00:16:43.738\n>> That shall remain nameless.\n\n296\n00:16:43.738 --> 00:16:45.177\n>> Yeah, that shall remain nameless.\n\n297\n00:16:45.177 --> 00:16:47.926\nAnd I said, hey,\nhere's what we're looking to do.\n\n298\n00:16:47.926 --> 00:16:52.874\nAnd the response that came back\nautomatically told me he didn't understand\n\n299\n00:16:52.874 --> 00:16:56.620\nwhat was the actually\nrequirement that I needed, okay?\n\n300\n00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:01.810\nSo, it's not that it was bad, it was just,\nhe thinks I'm really needing to do this,\n\n301\n00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.720\nbut no this is what I'm really needing.\n\n302\n00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:08.930\nSo I wrote him back, and he said,\nhere is who you contact to get this and\n\n303\n00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.270\nit was just really strange.\n\n304\n00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:14.470\nSo, it may have been a miscommunication on\nmy part, I can absolutely deal with that,\n\n305\n00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:17.530\nbut I just realized right away that\nhe didn't have a good understanding.\n\n306\n00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.270\nSo if he was actually a vendor\nthat I needed contact with,\n\n307\n00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.470\nI would say he didn't have\na good understanding and\n\n308\n00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.680\nthat actually kind of\nrules him out of the game.\n\n309\n00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.250\nTechnical expertise is another one,\nright.?\n\n310\n00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:29.900\nThat's a great idea of objective\nthings that we can take a look at.\n\n311\n00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:34.027\nAnd go yeah, they have the technical\nexpertise to do the work package\n\n312\n00:17:34.027 --> 00:17:36.883\nthat absolutely requires\nthem to be able to do.\n\n313\n00:17:36.883 --> 00:17:41.940\nNow when we get into the subjective side,\nif I ask for references okay?\n\n314\n00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.960\nAnd they put references down and they go,\nman I did a beautiful project here for\n\n315\n00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.930\nDaniel.\n\n316\n00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:49.130\nHe loves everything that I did.\n\n317\n00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:53.470\nI call Daniel up to get a reference,\nthen he goes I love what he did but\n\n318\n00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:54.620\nthe guy was a jerk.\n\n319\n00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.880\nI don't wanna deal with him ever again.\n\n320\n00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.660\nWell, that makes it a little\nbit more subjective, right?\n\n321\n00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:04.200\nYou might not think that that comes\ninto play you know, but it can.\n\n322\n00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.770\nSo you gotta actually\nthink about that as well.\n\n323\n00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:09.000\nA little bit more objective,\nagain, vendor experience,\n\n324\n00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.170\nmaybe their particular approach to\nproject management is more subjective.\n\n325\n00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:15.760\nYou meet with the guy one on and\ngo man, I really loved you,\n\n326\n00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.360\nand he just rubs you wrong.\n\n327\n00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.575\nI mean, is that the one that\nyou want to deal with as well?\n\n328\n00:18:19.575 --> 00:18:23.860\nOkay, so you kind of realize that there\nis a couple of things in objective here.\n\n329\n00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.130\nFinancial stability, and\nI want to save the last one here just for\n\n330\n00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.630\na moment, right?\n\n331\n00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:33.180\nSo there are always things that you can\nsay, these are the objective parts, but\n\n332\n00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.700\nthere is always going to be a subjective\npart, because of your own experience,\n\n333\n00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:41.410\nbecause of who you dealt with before, that\nyou got to give the proper weighting to.\n\n334\n00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:42.830\nNow is it fair to always say,\n\n335\n00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:45.810\nmy subjective side always should out,\nno, okay?\n\n336\n00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.870\nBut you do have to find\nthat balance to do so.\n\n337\n00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.920\nI remember when I was doing some\ndiesel mechanicing, that you know,\n\n338\n00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:57.890\nthere were a couple of different shops\nthat we would try out in the area that we\n\n339\n00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:03.260\nwere in, to try and get good work\ndone on the engine block itself.\n\n340\n00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.450\nAnd we tried a couple of them, and when\nthey came back, they always had something.\n\n341\n00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:09.676\nYou know,\neither it wasn't wrapped tightly, or\n\n342\n00:19:09.676 --> 00:19:13.440\nthere would be sand in some of\nthe passages, or it would just look dirty.\n\n343\n00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.760\nBut there was always one shop, even though\nthey were a little bit more expensive.\n\n344\n00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.700\nThat we brought it to, and when it\ncame back it was immaculate looking.\n\n345\n00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.284\nYou know all the time and the quality,\nbetween everything we ever did,\n\n346\n00:19:26.284 --> 00:19:28.560\nwas always at the highest quality.\n\n347\n00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.850\nSo even though it took us an hour or\nlonger to get to that place, and\n\n348\n00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:34.220\nto deliver our products there, and\n\n349\n00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.980\ntook us a little bit of time\nbefore we could get it back.\n\n350\n00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.270\nWe're always happy with\ntheir work as well.\n\n351\n00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:42.820\nAnd so if you're doing something like\nthat, you again use your past experience.\n\n352\n00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.910\nIs that subjective, or\nis it objective, at that point?\n\n353\n00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:46.170\nThat's subjective.\n\n354\n00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:48.400\nAnd that you'd go no, I'd rather do that.\n\n355\n00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.970\nSo there's always gonna be\nthat bit of subjectivism.\n\n356\n00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:55.680\nNow one of the last criteria here\nthat I wanted to make sure that we\n\n357\n00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.090\nfocused in on here.\n\n358\n00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:01.190\nIs remember that sometimes you may\nactually contract somebody to come in\n\n359\n00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:04.250\nbecause you don't have the expertise\non your side, you don't have anything.\n\n360\n00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:10.240\nThat they come in and they actually kind\nof maybe realize and build something,\n\n361\n00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.770\neven a unique thing, out of what\nyou've contracted them to do, okay?\n\n362\n00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:17.760\nBut they're working on your project.\n\n363\n00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.270\nYou may have to ask the question then,\nif there's work product that ends up\n\n364\n00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:27.610\ngetting developed during\nthe process of your project,\n\n365\n00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:30.770\nwho ends up owning that intellectual\nproperty at that point, okay?\n\n366\n00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.830\nAnd the proprietary rights,\n\n367\n00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:37.350\nif the vendor actually comes up with\nsomething as he worked on your project.\n\n368\n00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:41.750\nYou know, that may also be a deal\nbreaking point for you or for them.\n\n369\n00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.400\nWhere they say, no if we come\nup with something that's unique.\n\n370\n00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.730\nLet's say you actually realize as\na company that could actually do\n\n371\n00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.310\nunique things and\nthey want to actually have that.\n\n372\n00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.940\nYou go no, you did that working for\n\n373\n00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.270\nsomething for me and\nshould actually belong to me.\n\n374\n00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:58.740\nWell, again,\nthat's where those contract negotiations,\n\n375\n00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:02.520\nand you know again might actually\nexclude that better right from there.\n\n376\n00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:07.100\nSo there's always this idea\nthat you can be 100% objective.\n\n377\n00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.770\nI don't know in reality if it\nreally ends up working that way.\n\n378\n00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:10.590\nBut just kinda realize,\n\n379\n00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.530\nthere's a lot of criterias when we start\ntalking about the vendor selection.\n\n380\n00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:17.150\n>> Yeah, and when Ronny's talking\nabout he last point there,\n\n381\n00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.000\nit says who own the intellectual property?\n\n382\n00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.790\nWell what if the product that they create\nfor you which is your leading product,\n\n383\n00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:25.950\nit's yours you know that your\ndesign you've got a patent on that.\n\n384\n00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.975\nWhat if they develop a whole new\nprocess to create that product?\n\n385\n00:21:28.975 --> 00:21:30.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is that there process, or\n\n386\n00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.690\nis that now your-\n>> Yeah.\n\n387\n00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:33.280\n>> So it can get really iffy\n>> And\n\n388\n00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.750\nthat comes down to all about the contract,\nright Ronny?\n\n389\n00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:38.420\n>> Right.\n>> You really have to be specific\n\n390\n00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.930\nwhen it comes to the contracts\nwhen you're outsourcing work and\n\n391\n00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.170\nthat's what we're gonna tackle next.\n\n392\n00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:43.780\n>> You know, Daniel,\n\n393\n00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:47.200\neven though we're not really taking a look\nat it from the intellectual property\n\n394\n00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.100\nrights type of contracts here, we're\nreally looking at it from the monetary\n\n395\n00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.010\ncontract because those are the basic ones.\n\n396\n00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:55.550\nAre there tons more contracts\nthat you have to get into?\n\n397\n00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:56.150\nMaybe.\n\n398\n00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:59.950\nOkay and those again you'll probably\nactually go to somebody that knows\n\n399\n00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:03.040\ncontracts a lot more and\nwilling to deal with them a lot more.\n\n400\n00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.490\nIn which probably goes into the legal\ndepartment that your dealing with.\n\n401\n00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:09.290\nSo as a project manager you may go\nalright you're gonna deal with our legal\n\n402\n00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.390\ndepartment about how to\nget all this stuff done.\n\n403\n00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.180\nBut you're probably not\ngonna deal with me.\n\n404\n00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:14.420\nWhen it comes down to it,\n\n405\n00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.995\nyou do have to actually think about some\nof these contract developments here and\n\n406\n00:22:17.995 --> 00:22:20.420\nthe way you're going to look at\nthis as a project manager, okay?\n\n407\n00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.030\nWhat can you manage as\nfar as the contracts go?\n\n408\n00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:24.660\nWell, let me show you here, okay?\n\n409\n00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:29.450\nSo there is really three different types\nof contracts that we are ultimately gonna\n\n410\n00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:30.350\nend up managing.\n\n411\n00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.020\nOkay.\n\n412\n00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:34.070\nThere's what we call\nFixed-price contracts.\n\n413\n00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.730\nOkay.\n\n414\n00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:37.460\nWith fixed-price contracts\nis exactly like it sounds.\n\n415\n00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.390\nWe actually say hey,\nthere's a fixed price for\n\n416\n00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.360\nwhatever product that you're\ngonna end up producing.\n\n417\n00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.620\nHow much work you can do,\nhere's what I'm willing to spend.\n\n418\n00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.310\nThat's the price you agreed on.\n\n419\n00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:47.030\nWe're done.\n\n420\n00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:47.680\nOkay.\n\n421\n00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:53.120\nNow, this is absolutely a good thing for\nof course the buyer.\n\n422\n00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.517\nOkay, so when you're actually talking\na contract, there's always a buyer,\n\n423\n00:22:55.517 --> 00:22:56.602\nthere's always a seller.\n\n424\n00:22:56.602 --> 00:22:59.530\nOKay, this is absolutely a good thing for\n\n425\n00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:03.960\nthe buyer itself,\ncould be a risky thing for the seller,\n\n426\n00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.660\nin other words the person providing\nwhatever services or product that we have.\n\n427\n00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.850\nAnd the reason why right,\n\n428\n00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:14.000\nis that now, let's say that we agreed\nto this work and whatever it is.\n\n429\n00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.530\nAnd let's say that you're\ngonna produce something, and\n\n430\n00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.510\nit requires other elements\nthat come into this.\n\n431\n00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:22.480\nIf you say here's how much it's gonna\ncost, that means regardless of whether or\n\n432\n00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.340\nnot your team takes ten hours to do it or\n\n433\n00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:30.050\n24 hours to do it, you might have\nactually agreed to a fixed cost, okay?\n\n434\n00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.990\nAnd this is where you\nactually learn mechanicing at\n\n435\n00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:34.610\nthe kind of apprentice level, right?\n\n436\n00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:36.463\nThey tell you something\nthat actually gonna cost.\n\n437\n00:23:36.463 --> 00:23:38.210\nIt's gonna take four hours of time.\n\n438\n00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:41.010\nYou take eight hours to do it,\nwell they're not paying you for\n\n439\n00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.170\nthe eight hours,\nthey're paying you for the four, okay.\n\n440\n00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:44.850\nSo this is something that can happen.\n\n441\n00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:48.250\nAnd those are things that we might\nmanage as a project manager.\n\n442\n00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.738\nThe other one is what we call\ncost-reimbursable contracts as well.\n\n443\n00:23:51.738 --> 00:23:54.862\nOkay, we reimburse for\nthe cost associated with the goods and\n\n444\n00:23:54.862 --> 00:23:57.398\nservices that we are willing to purchase,\nokay?\n\n445\n00:23:57.398 --> 00:24:00.331\nThis is the one that's risky for\nthe buyer, for\n\n446\n00:24:00.331 --> 00:24:04.071\nme as a project manager Because\nnow Daniel can actually say,\n\n447\n00:24:04.071 --> 00:24:08.910\nI absolutely did work 25 hours on this,\nand because I actually went ahead and\n\n448\n00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:12.830\nagreed to reimburse him for\nthat time, it's perfectly fine.\n\n449\n00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:16.660\nDaniel's not really doing anything wrong,\nbut I can't absolutely monitor.\n\n450\n00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:20.060\nIf he says, look, this took ten hours\nlonger than I thought it was gonna be,\n\n451\n00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.730\nI agreed to reimburse for\nthose costs and services.\n\n452\n00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:27.070\nSo this can really drive up the price\nat the end result if we do that.\n\n453\n00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.090\nSo it just depends on what\nyou get into as far as money,\n\n454\n00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:31.320\nbut this is what you have to think about,\nokay.\n\n455\n00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.155\nAnd then of course there are time and\nmaterials contracts too.\n\n456\n00:24:34.155 --> 00:24:38.230\nWhen we start taking to look at the time\nand materials contracts, buyer and\n\n457\n00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:39.510\nseller agree on the rate of goods and\n\n458\n00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:44.580\nservices which absolutely sounds great,\nand should be a true agreement so\n\n459\n00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:47.850\nthat there's minimal risk for\nthe buyer, minimal risk for the seller.\n\n460\n00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:50.560\nIt's kind of the middle ground\nthat we talk about here.\n\n461\n00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:55.210\nBut the problem is you now have\nan unlimited cost ceiling, okay?\n\n462\n00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:59.760\nThe very fact is, you just don't\nknow how much this is actually gonna\n\n463\n00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.270\ndrive up things that you have.\n\n464\n00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:03.980\nSo you've gotta realize that\nthere's always trade-offs\n\n465\n00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.670\nto these types of contracts.\n\n466\n00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:09.350\nThen we start getting into property\nrights and intellectual property and\n\n467\n00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.780\nstuff like that, even more and\nmore contracts have to appear.\n\n468\n00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:18.860\nBut in that sense it's not something that\nyou can manage as a project manager.\n\n469\n00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.510\nThese are the ones that we can manage.\n\n470\n00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:24.820\nWe can absolutely say well, Daniel, we\ndon't have any more to reimburse you on,\n\n471\n00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.380\nor do we, okay?\n\n472\n00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:30.660\nYou agreed on this price, I can now as a\nproject manager say here's what you agreed\n\n473\n00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:34.690\nto do, you gotta get it done, and\nthis is the way it's gonna be.\n\n474\n00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:36.360\nBut in terms of intellectual rights,\n\n475\n00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.840\nthat's where you send it to legal team,\nlet them deal with it as well.\n\n476\n00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.600\nBut this is all part of that procurement,\nand\n\n477\n00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.230\nonce we start doing it,\nthis is kinda the basic breakdown.\n\n478\n00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:46.440\nIs it anything in detail?\n\n479\n00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.210\nNo way, I'm not gonna ever\nget into anything like that.\n\n480\n00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:49.980\nI'm gonna leave that for\n\n481\n00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:52.450\nthe people that go to law school-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n482\n00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:53.350\n>> To actually deal with\n\n483\n00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:54.620\nmore than anything else.\n\n484\n00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.760\nBut right here though,\nis at least a basis,\n\n485\n00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.420\nif you're actually starting\nto plan out for your project.\n\n486\n00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.800\nIf you know that there's a possibility\nyou're gonna reach out for\n\n487\n00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.660\nanybody on the outside of your project,\nessentially outsourcing it,\n\n488\n00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.620\nyou gotta actually come up with\nsome kind of procurement plan.\n\n489\n00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:10.200\n>> Excellent explanation Ronnie.\n\n490\n00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:14.000\nThis is something that we're all gonna\nhave to deal with as project managers.\n\n491\n00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.330\nSo you just gonna start\nworking your way into that.\n\n492\n00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:19.820\nGo over this episode a few time,\ncuz this is setting up\n\n493\n00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:22.620\na really good foundational set\nof knowledge for you on that.\n\n494\n00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:26.590\nSo that when it comes to okay, do we need\nto outsource this, or is this something we\n\n495\n00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:30.800\ncan do in-house, you start filling\nin the gaps of whatever goes outside\n\n496\n00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.430\nof the capabilities of your current\nsituation, your current environment.\n\n497\n00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:38.120\nNow you can bring those resources in,\nget the work done necessary, and\n\n498\n00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.020\ncomplete your projects\nas you need them to.\n\n499\n00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.030\nRonnie, is there anything else we need to\ncover for this episode before we wrap up?\n\n500\n00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.420\n>> Not really for\nthe idea of any type of planning for\n\n501\n00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.240\nprocurement when we start\ntaking a look here.\n\n502\n00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.160\nBut just realize that we\nhave a foundational level.\n\n503\n00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:55.650\nIf you want more and more information on\nthis, you might wanna check out the itself\n\n504\n00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:59.260\nand of course, our series on PNP\nto actually give you a little\n\n505\n00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:02.600\nbit more of a solid foundation there,\na little bit more in depth knowledge.\n\n506\n00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.610\nBut here is the general stuff\nthat normally goes into\n\n507\n00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.760\nbasic project procurement planning.\n\n508\n00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.910\n>> Excellent stuff, thanks again for\njoining us today Ronnie, and thank you for\n\n509\n00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:12.920\nwatching, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off.\n\n510\n00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.580\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n511\n00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.340\n>> And I'm Ronnie

series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.910\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nis none other than our good friend and\n\n6\n00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:25.820\nmentor, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.070\nRonnie, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n8\n00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.420\n>> Well thank you for\nhaving me on the show.\n\n9\n00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.072\nAs we continue to take a look\nat CompTIA's Project+ and\n\n10\n00:00:32.072 --> 00:00:36.010\nwe are continuing to move\nthrough our planning phase.\n\n11\n00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.282\nAnd today, we actually get to do\nsomething that's actually a little\n\n12\n00:00:38.282 --> 00:00:38.958\nbit unusual for us.\n\n13\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:44.640\nIn the past, well lots of episodes, we've\nreally been stuck in the planning phase.\n\n14\n00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.690\nToday, we're transitioning\nout of that planning phase.\n\n15\n00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.180\nAnd so there's one more element that\nwe need to talk about of course,\n\n16\n00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.860\nwhich is the idea of planning for\n\n17\n00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.970\ntransition management is what\nwe're actually talking about.\n\n18\n00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.740\nSo the good thing is, I've kind\nof made myself a deal even during\n\n19\n00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.030\nthe pre project set up or\nthe initiation phase.\n\n20\n00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.440\nWe went through the phases of project\nmanagement almost in every single episode.\n\n21\n00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.550\nDuring the plan, I'm not gonna do that\nto everybody on every single episode.\n\n22\n00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.470\nBut now that we've actually gotten a lot\nof episodes in and really just about to\n\n23\n00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.720\nfinish that planning phase,\nthis is a great point and reminder for us.\n\n24\n00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.460\nAnd then I wanna show you where\nthe transition phase fits in\n\n25\n00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.080\nhere with the transition plan fits in.\n\n26\n00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.480\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my diagram here.\n\n27\n00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.420\nAnd that will help reminds us of some of\nthe things that we are looking at as well.\n\n28\n00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.650\nSo when we start to do what\nwe call project management.\n\n29\n00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.459\nRemember that if all projects go\nthrough five different phases and\n\n30\n00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:48.404\neven though we tend to be able to\ntalk about them in sequential order,\n\n31\n00:01:48.404 --> 00:01:50.528\nthey don't really happen that way.\n\n32\n00:01:50.528 --> 00:01:53.380\nIn reality it tends to\nbe this way instead.\n\n33\n00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.750\nWe talk about the idea of the initiation\nof the pre-project set up and\n\n34\n00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.980\nthis is where we have the basic idea\nof the project coming on board and\n\n35\n00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.648\nwe don't really have anything else yet.\n\n36\n00:02:04.648 --> 00:02:07.920\nBut we wanna make sure that we get\neverything started to set up for\n\n37\n00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.140\nour project.\n\n38\n00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.716\nThe initial outcome of that\nis gonna end up being for\n\n39\n00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:17.448\nus of course, then the project charter.\n\n40\n00:02:17.448 --> 00:02:22.377\nThe project charter is essentially a nice\nbig summary of everything we believe\n\n41\n00:02:22.377 --> 00:02:25.450\nwe're gonna accomplish on the project.\n\n42\n00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.257\nBut ultimately, the most important\nelement of that project charter is\n\n43\n00:02:30.257 --> 00:02:35.063\nthat project sponsor signing off,\nauthorizing us to go ahead and say,\n\n44\n00:02:35.063 --> 00:02:38.767\nthis project can now get\nstarted is what we're doing.\n\n45\n00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:43.772\nThen what we've been doing is right\nhere in the planning phase and\n\n46\n00:02:43.772 --> 00:02:48.520\nin the planning we've taken\na lot of time multiple elements.\n\n47\n00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.710\nWe've talked about the idea of\nplanning out the work packages.\n\n48\n00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.140\nWe've talked about the scheduling\nof our project as well.\n\n49\n00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.440\nWe've also talked about cost management,\nquality management,\n\n50\n00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.210\nwe've taken a look at a lot\nof different things too.\n\n51\n00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.230\nProcurement, human resource management,\nresource management.\n\n52\n00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.580\nYou name it, we've taken a look\nat a lot of different plans and\n\n53\n00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.890\nsome of the things that we have\nto consider as project managers.\n\n54\n00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.529\nAnd so we're about to move in,\n\n55\n00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:18.388\nespecially as the episodes start\nthat we're about to begin recording.\n\n56\n00:03:18.388 --> 00:03:24.380\nWe're really moving into the execution\nphase is where we're moving into.\n\n57\n00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.357\nAnd then after that of course,\nwill be monitoring and controlling and\n\n58\n00:03:27.357 --> 00:03:28.018\nthen closing.\n\n59\n00:03:28.018 --> 00:03:32.269\nAnd so when you look at the way that it's\nnormally lined up as a linear line most of\n\n60\n00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.458\nthe time, where you see initiation,\nplanning, execution, monitoring and\n\n61\n00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:38.440\ncontrolling, and closing.\n\n62\n00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.490\nWell we realized something here that\nwhat happens is as you execute,\n\n63\n00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.780\nyour also doing monitoring and\ncontrolling in reality at the same time.\n\n64\n00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.710\nAnd then you're probably finishing both\nof them up about the same time and\n\n65\n00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.470\nthen turning it over to closing, which\nis closing out of the entire project.\n\n66\n00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.760\nSo those are kind of the basic\nphases that we're talking about\n\n67\n00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.470\nwhen we actually start to look at\nthe overall project management.\n\n68\n00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.248\nAlso as a great point in time for us to\nbe reminded of the project constraints.\n\n69\n00:04:07.248 --> 00:04:11.644\nAnd we'll be dealing more with project\nconstraints especially in the execution\n\n70\n00:04:11.644 --> 00:04:14.250\nphase as we try and balance all three.\n\n71\n00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.220\nRemember that what we are always\ntrying to do here is make sure that\n\n72\n00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.520\nthe requirements, the scheduling, and\nthe budget are all actually in balance,\n\n73\n00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.880\nand that's actually a very good thing for\nus on the project.\n\n74\n00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.100\nAny time we emphasize\none over the other ones,\n\n75\n00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.240\nthe other two will end up suffering here.\n\n76\n00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.131\nSo if we say that we need something to be\nfast, well what ends up happening then is\n\n77\n00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:40.738\nthat puts more of a burden on the idea\nof meeting the project requirements.\n\n78\n00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:43.856\nIn other words, we may cut short\non those requirements, and\n\n79\n00:04:43.856 --> 00:04:46.320\nwe end up costing a lot more as well.\n\n80\n00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.540\nSo remember that there's usually\na cliche that's also involved here.\n\n81\n00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.490\nWe always talk about this idea that\neverybody wants everything good,\n\n82\n00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.810\nfast, and cheap.\n\n83\n00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.120\nWell, we can give you two out of\nthe three the majority of the times.\n\n84\n00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.798\nBut you can't actually take all three and\nsay, I want all of them.\n\n85\n00:05:00.798 --> 00:05:04.449\nWhat you would normally have to do is\nactually figure out a balance between them\n\n86\n00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.390\nas much as you can and\nnot weigh one more than the other.\n\n87\n00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.740\nSo that's the key here in\ngetting a project done.\n\n88\n00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.700\nAnd that's why we go through the planning\nis so that this can actually happen\n\n89\n00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.680\nduring the time we're really starting\nto get work done for our project.\n\n90\n00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.620\nNow, even though we're now really at the\nend and finish of our planning, and we're\n\n91\n00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.148\nnot really creating a ton of other plans\nthat we have to worry about and look at.\n\n92\n00:05:29.148 --> 00:05:33.730\nWe do need to actually create what\nwe call a project transition plan.\n\n93\n00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.170\nAnd the project transition plan for\nus works on multiple levels.\n\n94\n00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.380\nSo let me show you where a project\ntransition plan would normally fit in\n\n95\n00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.500\nto the overall scheme.\n\n96\n00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.540\nSo I'm gonna go back to this diagram.\n\n97\n00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.900\nDown here, let me go ahead and\nadd in the other word here.\n\n98\n00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.988\nI put transition but\nlet me talk about transition plan here.\n\n99\n00:05:54.988 --> 00:05:57.849\nIf we wanted to talk\nabout transition plans,\n\n100\n00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:03.280\nwell normally we have a transition plan\njust for every phases in our project.\n\n101\n00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.561\nAs I'm moving out of the initiation\ngoing into the project planning,\n\n102\n00:06:08.561 --> 00:06:13.228\nI don't have an official plan\nthat's normally written out.\n\n103\n00:06:13.228 --> 00:06:17.651\nBut once I actually get a project charter,\nthat now authorizes me to go ahead and\n\n104\n00:06:17.651 --> 00:06:21.480\nbegin, so that is kind of an add ad\nhoc transition plan that is to say,\n\n105\n00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.210\nhere is a go no go at this point.\n\n106\n00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.698\nI get it signed, we're ready to move on.\n\n107\n00:06:25.698 --> 00:06:29.631\nAt the end of the planning phase\nas I move in from planning,\n\n108\n00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:32.845\nin other words getting\nall my plans together and\n\n109\n00:06:32.845 --> 00:06:37.940\nwe're about to move in to transition\nof execution of my project.\n\n110\n00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.550\nI can also have a transition phase right\nthere, and I might need a plan for that.\n\n111\n00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.208\nIn other words, do wanna have\nall of those plans ready to go?\n\n112\n00:06:46.208 --> 00:06:49.956\nDo they need to be reviewed or, do they\nneed that actually take a look at some\n\n113\n00:06:49.956 --> 00:06:52.578\nother things that are going\non before we begin this?\n\n114\n00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:56.574\nIs there anything else that we need\nto do as we now turn it over to,\n\n115\n00:06:56.574 --> 00:07:02.160\nwell the actual functional managers that\nare now gonna be carrying out the work?\n\n116\n00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.452\nSo I can come out with a plan for all of\nmy different phases in the execution to\n\n117\n00:07:06.452 --> 00:07:09.808\nsay, here's how this stuff\nis going to transition over.\n\n118\n00:07:09.808 --> 00:07:12.109\nWho do I hand these plans off to?\n\n119\n00:07:12.109 --> 00:07:13.920\nHow do I actually get this thing going?\n\n120\n00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.840\nSo we can have that too.\n\n121\n00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.840\nAnd then of course ultimately,\n\n122\n00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:24.910\nwhen everything is done as far as work\ngoes on the entire project itself,\n\n123\n00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:31.030\nnow we can talk about the hand\noff to whoever our customer is.\n\n124\n00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.780\nNow, remember our customer can\nbe internal to our company,\n\n125\n00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.460\nit can be external to our company as well.\n\n126\n00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.952\nSo what you're starting to see\nhere is the same cycles that we\n\n127\n00:07:39.952 --> 00:07:44.548\ntalked about at the beginning of the\nplanning phase that everything has a plan.\n\n128\n00:07:44.548 --> 00:07:48.166\nSo even though we talked about\nmoving into the planning cycle for\n\n129\n00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:52.990\nthe overall project itself, as we start\nactually breaking down into work packages,\n\n130\n00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:57.630\nI can assign that work package to them and\nsay Dan, start planning this out for me.\n\n131\n00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:02.173\nDan works through all the plans that\nhe needs to for his work package and\n\n132\n00:08:02.173 --> 00:08:04.406\nthen at the end, he might go, so.\n\n133\n00:08:04.406 --> 00:08:07.794\nWho in the world after I've\nfinished my work package,\n\n134\n00:08:07.794 --> 00:08:11.720\nwhere does that product go or\nwhat does the next step?\n\n135\n00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.720\nAnd then I tell them,\nyou're supposed to hand that off to Mike.\n\n136\n00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.600\nWell, what are those procedures?\n\n137\n00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.680\nThat's where that\ntransition phase comes in.\n\n138\n00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.520\nThe procedures that need to be\ndone then to hand it off to Mike.\n\n139\n00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.760\nSo you can see why everything that we do,\n\n140\n00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.320\neven though this is the overall\nprocess at a major scale,\n\n141\n00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.290\nyou can see how that actually continues\nto break down level by level.\n\n142\n00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.690\nSo that everything we're\ndoing is at process.\n\n143\n00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:36.220\nAnd you might say why is so\nimportant we follow that?\n\n144\n00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.300\nBecause this is about project management,\nright?\n\n145\n00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.970\nThe ability for us to manage everything\n\n146\n00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:46.040\nactually breaks down that way where\nwe do have it at every single level.\n\n147\n00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.190\nAnd so we turn that over so\n\n148\n00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:51.030\nI'm not micromanaging Daniel's\nparticular work package.\n\n149\n00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:54.620\nDaniel's not having to go and\nmicromanage somebody else's.\n\n150\n00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.350\nHe just goes ahead and says look, make\nsure sure you follow this process through.\n\n151\n00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.710\nAnd we start seeing that.\n\n152\n00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:03.050\nSo that's where you also will\nsee transition management\n\n153\n00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.250\noverall when you start seeing that.\n\n154\n00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.360\nSo everybody has their transitions.\n\n155\n00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.150\nAnd we all have to work with them cuz\nwe're working with people a lot of times.\n\n156\n00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.470\nAnd we have to actually make\nsure they're coordinated,\n\n157\n00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:14.920\nthat they fit into\nthe overall project itself.\n\n158\n00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.050\n>> Now Ronnie when it comes\nto transition management and\n\n159\n00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.750\ncreating that plan,\nhow do you know who is that owner?\n\n160\n00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.890\nDoes that come back to what\nwe did in our pre-planning or\n\n161\n00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:25.960\nduring our planning phases itself?\n\n162\n00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.170\n>> It really can, right?\n\n163\n00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.960\nSo when you actually go all\nthe way back to pre-planning,\n\n164\n00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.060\nyou may actually know who is\nactually gonna be the owner.\n\n165\n00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.900\nSo we take a look at the grand\nscale which is what we're gonna do.\n\n166\n00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.210\nWhat are some of the elements that we\ninclude inside of this project plan?\n\n167\n00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:45.350\nOne of that, one of those elements then,\nis that depending on where we are, right?\n\n168\n00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.320\nWhen we are finished let's\nsay with the overall project,\n\n169\n00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.990\nwe need something that absolutely\nsays who is now the owner, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.400\nNow that sounds a little bit unusual.\n\n171\n00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.600\nOf course you say\nthe customer's the owner.\n\n172\n00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.110\nBut did the customer\nactually sign off on that?\n\n173\n00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:02.620\nIn other words,\ndid he receive the deliverable?\n\n174\n00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.930\nIf he hasn't received a deliverable.\n\n175\n00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:08.780\nEven though Daniel is now saying, I'm\ndone with my project, well, who owns it,\n\n176\n00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:09.300\nyou know?\n\n177\n00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.150\nAnd that's actually a good question.\n\n178\n00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.210\nIs it the company that still possesses it,\n\n179\n00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.190\neven though Daniel says,\nI'm done with the project.\n\n180\n00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:21.480\nIs it the actual customer who has yet\nto actually receive the deliverable.\n\n181\n00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.130\nDaniel, we're kind of in a mess there,\nright?\n\n182\n00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:29.120\nIf we don't actually have anything that\nsays once this is done, whose the owner?\n\n183\n00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.310\nSo you can see why this is very\nimportant that we decide this.\n\n184\n00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:33.850\nSo a lot of times when\nwe start doing this,\n\n185\n00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.440\nlet's take a look at\nmy machine again here.\n\n186\n00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.730\nAnd we'll kind go through\nthis just a little bit here.\n\n187\n00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:40.420\nI just hit some bullet points.\n\n188\n00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.470\nWe talked about the idea of the hand off.\n\n189\n00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:47.550\nIt could be, I know it sounds funny and\nsilly, but it could be that,\n\n190\n00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.320\nwhat happens is Daniel's the customer,\nI'm actually the project manager,\n\n191\n00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.160\nwe both spit in our hand and\nwe shake on it.\n\n192\n00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.360\nThat could be the hand off.\n\n193\n00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.880\nThat says everything actually\nis exchanged and done.\n\n194\n00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.490\nI'm not going to do that, but\nwe could do something like that.\n\n195\n00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.430\n>> Not very sanitary.\n\n196\n00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.980\n>> Not very sanitary, but\nit's a handoff right?\n\n197\n00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:09.010\nIn other words, what signifies what\nis the official action that we have\n\n198\n00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:12.900\nthat says the ownership now is\ntransferred off of my shoulder, so\n\n199\n00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:17.740\nwhatever the product is is now\nDaniel's shoulder, on his end instead,\n\n200\n00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:22.200\nwhen we do something right like this,\nit signifies the entire completion.\n\n201\n00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:26.620\nAnd then when we talk about the project\nitself, okay, that the execution.\n\n202\n00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.270\nDaniel has nothing else to do with that,\nokay.\n\n203\n00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:33.060\nEven now, if Daniel were the customer and\n\n204\n00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:37.690\nhe goes I don't like this,\nscratch this right here I'm done, okay?\n\n205\n00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.270\nAnd I can tell him hey,\nthere's some other things we can do,\n\n206\n00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.030\nbut I'm done with the project.\n\n207\n00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:47.390\nI don't have any responsibility that\nthe scratch happened right after that.\n\n208\n00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.760\nSo we end the entire execution.\n\n209\n00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.180\nMonitor and controlling is no longer ours.\n\n210\n00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.730\nIt's now somebody else's\nresponsibility as well.\n\n211\n00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.400\nAnd that is the key here too.\n\n212\n00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.380\nSo we'll be a little bit more careful.\n\n213\n00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.910\nWe define who's actually responsible now.\n\n214\n00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.420\nFor what the overall product is.\n\n215\n00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.730\nAnd remember, when we start taking a look\nin the same vein, even at the work package\n\n216\n00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:12.450\nlevel, right, the WBS structure level,\nit will be the same thing as Daniel.\n\n217\n00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.160\nAs everything ends for his for\nhis particular work package and\n\n218\n00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.760\nhe's working for another one he's\nhanding that one off to Mike.\n\n219\n00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.680\nWell, again,\n\n220\n00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.640\nit has to be that way where Daniel is\nactually giving what, assurances that\n\n221\n00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.570\nI've done everything that I need to before\nMike actually sets it off they agree.\n\n222\n00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:29.350\nDid you check this?\n\n223\n00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.490\nIs all this actually done?\n\n224\n00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:35.220\nAnd then they go over it together and says\nhey, are you now gonna accept the package?\n\n225\n00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.260\nThen everything actually\nmoves on from there.\n\n226\n00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.090\nSo everything is about being\nnoted to see that management and\n\n227\n00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.150\nso ownership is a key\nelement in the transition.\n\n228\n00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.800\n>> Now Ronnie,\nwhen it comes to ownership-, and\n\n229\n00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.320\nI'm just thinking out loud here.\n\n230\n00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:52.280\nWhen I'm starting to transition from\nlet's say, I'm the customer here.\n\n231\n00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.630\nThe same scenario.\n\n232\n00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:57.360\nIs there ever any kind\nof gradient transition?\n\n233\n00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.720\nIs it always that cut and dry?\n\n234\n00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.190\nI'm done with my work and now here's\nthe product, you sign off on it, and\n\n235\n00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:03.020\nwe're done?\n\n236\n00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.530\nOr is there ever a time when it's like\nokay I'm gonna start to transition and\n\n237\n00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.790\nit takes a period of time before\nthe transition actually completes.\n\n238\n00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.560\n>> It again depends on what it is.\n\n239\n00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.510\nIf I'm just delivering you a product,\nthen it's done that way.\n\n240\n00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:21.140\nBut, if there's a process, if there\nis a result that has to happen, but\n\n241\n00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.560\nhas actually come about in\na long duration of time,\n\n242\n00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.440\nthis is where the transition actually\ncomes in as far as the planning.\n\n243\n00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.680\nSo it could be that\nthe transition plan is simple.\n\n244\n00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.780\nLike I said, we spit in our hands.\n\n245\n00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.590\nWe shake each other's hands,\ntransition's done.\n\n246\n00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.000\nBut what if it is actually\nsome type of process?\n\n247\n00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.750\nAnd we mentioned this, I think, right\nafter the show that we did yesterday.\n\n248\n00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:44.450\nWhat if we do come up with\na new manufacturing process\n\n249\n00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.730\nthat is revolutionary to\nwhatever we want to manufacture?\n\n250\n00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.760\nPeople have been doing\nthe manufacturing for a long time, but\n\n251\n00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.770\nwe wanna show them the new process.\n\n252\n00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:57.130\nIt wouldn't be fair for us as people that\ndeveloped the new process in our project\n\n253\n00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.330\nto just go, all right,\nDaniel, here you go.\n\n254\n00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:00.570\nHave fun, bye.\n\n255\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.510\nI'm leaving, I'm done.\n\n256\n00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:06.640\nSo what you may do during\nthis transition time is say,\n\n257\n00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.020\nhere are some of the other\nthings that we need to include.\n\n258\n00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.040\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at those two.\n\n259\n00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.650\nOne of them is the idea of\nthese dates here as well.\n\n260\n00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:18.410\nIn other words what is the timeline for\nthe actual transition to happen?\n\n261\n00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.550\nSo when we start to take a look\nat the idea of the timeline,\n\n262\n00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:26.110\nremember it could be one time but a lot\nof times it could actually include in,\n\n263\n00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:31.210\nlet's say a turnover period in\nwhich what we do at the end here.\n\n264\n00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:32.750\nAs we said,\nlook this is what's gonna happen.\n\n265\n00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:36.980\nWe're gonna bring a couple of people that\nyou really want to learn this project.\n\n266\n00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:42.000\nWe're gonna show them the last results\nof what we have in place here, and\n\n267\n00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.040\nwhat needs to happen immediately.\n\n268\n00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.880\nSo you may just actually take\nthem through that immediate time,\n\n269\n00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.810\nwhere they actually get it implemented,\nor whatever it might be.\n\n270\n00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:52.080\nBut we're still responsible for it.\n\n271\n00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.780\nThere's still a couple of bugs\nthat need to be worked out.\n\n272\n00:14:54.780 --> 00:15:00.930\nWe may go ahead and do that, that idea\nof the transition date and time as well.\n\n273\n00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:03.510\nNow the other elements that\nwe may also include because,\n\n274\n00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.890\nthis is what I hope Dan was\ntrying to get to as well,\n\n275\n00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.100\nis that we may actually even\noffer training too, okay?\n\n276\n00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:15.410\nSo if it is a process that\nwe have delivered over.\n\n277\n00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.830\nWe have a couple of different\nthings in this transition time\n\n278\n00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.570\nthat we also need to be able to do.\n\n279\n00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.360\nWe need to provide some training.\n\n280\n00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:26.770\nNow, the thing is, in this transition\nplan, our goal is not to actually say\n\n281\n00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.650\nwe're gonna provide the training, but\ndecide who's responsible for that.\n\n282\n00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:32.340\nIt could be that we are.\n\n283\n00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.820\nWe are the team that's actually gonna\nbe leading people through training\n\n284\n00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.980\nin transitioning over to this new process.\n\n285\n00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:43.880\nBut, you might actually find out\nthat we might contract this out.\n\n286\n00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.210\nIn other words we know somebody,\nwe've already been training them on it.\n\n287\n00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.930\nThey're actually the certified\ninstructors to this.\n\n288\n00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.430\nLet's go ahead and\nallow them to do the training instead.\n\n289\n00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:56.490\nSo you define how that training is\ngonna be provided, that they're\n\n290\n00:15:56.490 --> 00:16:00.990\ngonna be trained for a specific amount\nof time, how long is training to be.\n\n291\n00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:04.360\nLet's say it's one week for\nevery employee that's gonna be doing that.\n\n292\n00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.286\nAnd we send somebody out for\none week to do the training there.\n\n293\n00:16:07.286 --> 00:16:10.198\nWell, if something like that happens,\nthat's perfectly fine,\n\n294\n00:16:10.198 --> 00:16:14.190\nas long as it's in the transition plan and\nboth sides actually agree to it.\n\n295\n00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:18.440\nThe key that you don't want happening\nis when we turn over that project and\n\n296\n00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.570\nthey now go, this is nice and\nshiny, but what do we do with it?\n\n297\n00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:23.600\nThat's terrible.\n\n298\n00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.193\n>> Yeah, sometimes the product that you\ncome up with is more complex than [LAUGH]\n\n299\n00:16:28.193 --> 00:16:29.287\nyou can imagine.\n\n300\n00:16:29.287 --> 00:16:32.972\nAnd you're gonna need to help the customer\nout with figuring out how to use\n\n301\n00:16:32.972 --> 00:16:34.480\nthe developed product.\n\n302\n00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.940\nThat is a common thing.\n\n303\n00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.610\nWe all go through training,\n\n304\n00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:41.880\nwe all go through a learning phase\nwith anything that's new to us.\n\n305\n00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:46.000\nSo if that is the case,\nthen you've gotta put that as in a part of\n\n306\n00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.380\nyour project manager, a part of every\npart of the plan to be honest with you.\n\n307\n00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:53.100\nAnd specifically here in transition as\nI'm saying, I'm handing you the baton.\n\n308\n00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.940\nI want you to be able to take over and\nenjoy the thing that we've worked so\n\n309\n00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.690\nhard on to deliver to you.\n\n310\n00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:02.760\nAnd if I just drop it in your lap and\nsay, good luck with that.\n\n311\n00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.594\nIt's not gonna be very\nfair to the customer.\n\n312\n00:17:04.594 --> 00:17:07.622\nHe's gonna have a poor experience,\nand well, they're probably not\n\n313\n00:17:07.622 --> 00:17:10.305\ngonna come back to you for\nany more project management [LAUGH].\n\n314\n00:17:10.305 --> 00:17:13.534\nBut that's not the only place that\nit can continue on, Ronnie, right?\n\n315\n00:17:13.534 --> 00:17:14.205\n>> Right.\n\n316\n00:17:14.205 --> 00:17:17.826\n>> We might even have to help\nbeyond the project, right?\n\n317\n00:17:17.826 --> 00:17:19.223\n>> You normally will, a lot of times,\n\n318\n00:17:19.223 --> 00:17:21.940\nespecially with something\nthat's incredibly complex.\n\n319\n00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.980\nEven though you might have\ndesigned that process and\n\n320\n00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.550\neven provided a little bit of training,\nit may have to go beyond that.\n\n321\n00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:29.000\nBecause just like everything else,\n\n322\n00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.440\nright, we start to understand something\nespecially about training a lot of times.\n\n323\n00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.450\nWe train for what we believe is gonna\nbe the most likely scenario, okay.\n\n324\n00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.030\nThe very fact is, you tend to train.\n\n325\n00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:46.240\nAnd if you've done any type of\nofficial instructor led training.\n\n326\n00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.680\nA lot of times,\nthe labs that you end up doing,\n\n327\n00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.790\nthey work perfectly when you're\nactually in the training, right?\n\n328\n00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:54.260\nWhen you do the scenario\nexactly step-by-step,\n\n329\n00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.680\nthey work exactly the way\nthat they should.\n\n330\n00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.450\nAnd everybody's like, wow, that was great.\n\n331\n00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.650\nYou get home and now what?\n\n332\n00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:04.400\nSomething doesn't work exactly\nthe way it said it should work.\n\n333\n00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.030\nSo sometimes what ends up\nhappening is that you do have to\n\n334\n00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.770\noffer some extended support as well.\n\n335\n00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:13.000\nAnd this can be done again,\nin several different ways.\n\n336\n00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.660\nIt also depends on the customer and\nalso what your abilities are.\n\n337\n00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.670\nYou might find out, like we said,\nthat a third party is willing to\n\n338\n00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:22.730\nhandle this because they feel very\ncomfortable with your product.\n\n339\n00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.960\nSo you may actually hand\nthat off to another company.\n\n340\n00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.550\nAnd that's perfectly fine as long as\nthat's agreeable to the customer.\n\n341\n00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.130\nBut you may find yourself or\n\n342\n00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:34.640\nyour team involved in the actual\nextended support too.\n\n343\n00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.288\nSo usually the reason why we offer\nthe extended support is because we realize\n\n344\n00:18:38.288 --> 00:18:38.924\nsomething.\n\n345\n00:18:38.924 --> 00:18:43.374\nThat ideally the training should be\nsufficient for everything that you end up\n\n346\n00:18:43.374 --> 00:18:48.130\ndoing, but it's not really sufficient\nwhen emergencies end up happening.\n\n347\n00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.290\nWhen things don't go exactly right,\n\n348\n00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:53.080\nwhat they need is somebody that's\nactually worked with it enough.\n\n349\n00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.360\nAnd now they go, yeah,\nI've seen that before.\n\n350\n00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.330\nIt doesn't happen very often.\n\n351\n00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:00.320\nAnd those are also the people\nthat are connected with you\n\n352\n00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.930\nthat then could call you back and go,\nI haven't seen this error before.\n\n353\n00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:05.560\nIs this a great way to be able to do this?\n\n354\n00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.740\nSo you might actually end up offering\nextended support in that way.\n\n355\n00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.430\nNow when you start doing that, you do also\nhave to decide here, and let's take a look\n\n356\n00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:16.840\nat my diagram again, about what we\ncall the length and level of support.\n\n357\n00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.830\nAnd this is where you get into the area\nof the service level agreements as\n\n358\n00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:21.960\nwell, right?\n\n359\n00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.750\nSo your company or\n\n360\n00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:28.010\nwhoever you contract out with, you\ndecide on that service level agreement.\n\n361\n00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:32.260\nHow long is this agreement for, and\nwhat level of service are you willing to\n\n362\n00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.510\nprovide before they call on you,\nor before anything else happens.\n\n363\n00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:39.150\nAll that should also be in\nthat transition phase as well.\n\n364\n00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:43.630\nThis way nobody is ever\ndoubting what should happen.\n\n365\n00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:47.040\nThey get the product,\nthey get whatever their process is,\n\n366\n00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.360\nthey don't know how it works because\nnow they've installed something wrong.\n\n367\n00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.520\nWell, even if they installed it wrong,\nright, and you provided the training to\n\n368\n00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.520\nget it installed right, it doesn't\nmean that they remember everything.\n\n369\n00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.110\nBut now they may say, look,\nwe really need this up and running.\n\n370\n00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:02.970\nCan you send Daniel out to help us,\n\n371\n00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.758\nto make sure that we got everything\nin place in the way that we want to?\n\n372\n00:20:06.758 --> 00:20:10.235\nIt's Daniel's time and\nhis expertise on that product\n\n373\n00:20:10.235 --> 00:20:12.750\nthat allows him to come in and\ngo, here's what you did.\n\n374\n00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.720\nYou simply moved this module and\nyou put it after this one,\n\n375\n00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.010\nwhich it should be the other way around.\n\n376\n00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:21.530\nAnd even though that's a simple fix,\nit's simple for Daniel, but for\n\n377\n00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:24.520\nsomebody just receiving training on it,\nmaybe not as simple.\n\n378\n00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:28.700\nSo extended support here, service level\nagreements like that, really do help and\n\n379\n00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.950\nthis actually goes down\nto even daily hours.\n\n380\n00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:34.180\nAre you going to do it for\n24 hours a day, 7 days a week?\n\n381\n00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:39.120\nOr is this actually gonna be like,\nyou get two phone calls.\n\n382\n00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:44.090\nI was trying to remember like Microsoft,\nthey give you like five phone calls right,\n\n383\n00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:47.590\nif you have their gold membership or\nwhatever as you get these five super\n\n384\n00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:52.640\ntechnical level of super\ntech type of support calls.\n\n385\n00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.790\nOr are they gonna send somebody out\nto you to actually fix something?\n\n386\n00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:01.150\nSo, you do have to actually make sure\nthat all that's in that transition phase.\n\n387\n00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:04.100\nAnd last thing that we want to talk\nabout here is just simply the idea of\n\n388\n00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:04.970\nwarranties.\n\n389\n00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:09.477\nNow when we start talking about the idea\nof warranties, who is now gonna be\n\n390\n00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:14.250\nresponsible for\npost project work that is done, right?\n\n391\n00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.670\nYou're done with the project,\nyou are officially done.\n\n392\n00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:20.424\nWhen you finished your execution,\nyou handed it over, okay?\n\n393\n00:21:20.424 --> 00:21:23.780\nThe product and\nthe work itself is done, okay?\n\n394\n00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.480\nUsually when we start talking about\nwarranties at this point, right,\n\n395\n00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.810\nit's usually for some type of defect\nthat occurred during the project time or\n\n396\n00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.370\nduring the actual manufacturing time.\n\n397\n00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:36.640\nAnd these are things that can actually be,\nagain, accounted for.\n\n398\n00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.100\nWell, even though you go, well,\nI have nothing else to do with it,\n\n399\n00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.540\nthe project's done.\n\n400\n00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.790\nYour particular company may\noffer a warranty to say,\n\n401\n00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:47.830\nwe are still gonna be responsible for\nsome of the things.\n\n402\n00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:51.790\nSo let's say, if it's a design flaw,\nwe'll be responsible for it.\n\n403\n00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:58.219\nLet's say, if it's a process flaw,\nsomething that we did, yes.\n\n404\n00:21:58.219 --> 00:22:03.080\nBut if it's an installation thing, we may\nnot actually do support for that, okay?\n\n405\n00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.070\nOr if you've abused a product,\nthat's the one I normally see, right?\n\n406\n00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:10.190\nIf you've used this in any other way\nbesides what it was designed for,\n\n407\n00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:14.300\nthen you can't actually ask us to\ndo warranty work for that as well.\n\n408\n00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.520\nNow can you pay somebody to do it?\n\n409\n00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.790\nProbably, but remember,\nthat's not gonna come under warranty.\n\n410\n00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:21.040\nWarranty is about who is responsible for\npaying for\n\n411\n00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.480\nthat work, not about just\nwho's doing the work itself.\n\n412\n00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.100\nSo just kind of realize that happens too,\nand\n\n413\n00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:31.770\nyou can even include in a bit of service\nlevel agreement in that warranty and\n\n414\n00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.910\nmake sure those are clearly delineated.\n\n415\n00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:37.300\nBut all that comes in that transition\nphase, when we start taking it and\n\n416\n00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.670\nlooking at it from the overall\nproject itself toward the end.\n\n417\n00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:41.910\nIs that part of planning?\n\n418\n00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.890\nIt is a part of planning itself, right?\n\n419\n00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:48.680\nThey don't really consider it\na transition plan per se, but\n\n420\n00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.560\nit is something that we\ndo need to think about.\n\n421\n00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.200\nThat when we finish a project,\nwhat is done with it?\n\n422\n00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.850\nWe don't just get a lot of times,\nI'm gonna say this in all honesty.\n\n423\n00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:01.810\nYou don't just get to say, I'm done,\nI walk away, and you disappear.\n\n424\n00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.890\nYou normally do have to stand\nbehind your work some way, somehow.\n\n425\n00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:07.850\nThe transition phase,\nmake sure that everybody's in agreement of\n\n426\n00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:12.080\nwho's gonna be responsible for it, who's\ngonna pay for it, how long is it gonna be.\n\n427\n00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.240\nAnd that way everybody knows and\ncan actually accept it, and\n\n428\n00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.870\nmove on from that point.\n\n429\n00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:20.850\nBut it is a very important part of\nactually finishing up the idea of planning\n\n430\n00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:21.970\nas well.\n\n431\n00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:26.020\nSo once you have that in hand,\nnow you can feel with confidence that,\n\n432\n00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:29.460\nas you hand this product off\nto whoever your customer is,\n\n433\n00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.854\nthat they do have the ability to\nredress anything that they need to.\n\n434\n00:23:32.854 --> 00:23:35.352\nAnd that you feel good about it as well,\nthat you don't just go,\n\n435\n00:23:35.352 --> 00:23:40.960\nlet me leave as quietly as I can and\ndisappear so they can't find me again.\n\n436\n00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.770\nSo the transition is really a great\nelement that we need to include.\n\n437\n00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:45.485\n>> That's right, and\nthat's really what it's all about.\n\n438\n00:23:45.485 --> 00:23:48.628\nIs trying to get the product\nafter the project is over\n\n439\n00:23:48.628 --> 00:23:53.500\nfrom your hands into the customer, and\nhave it delivered and them be satisfied.\n\n440\n00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:57.779\nAnd then your extended level of\ninteraction with them as well,\n\n441\n00:23:57.779 --> 00:23:59.967\nas necessary, after the fact.\n\n442\n00:23:59.967 --> 00:24:02.405\nAnd that's what we do here, and\nwe're almost done with the planning.\n\n443\n00:24:02.405 --> 00:24:04.042\nSo you got to put that into your plan.\n\n444\n00:24:04.042 --> 00:24:04.598\n>> Yeah.\n\n445\n00:24:04.598 --> 00:24:08.486\n>> So that when the project is\nover you've made those caveats,\n\n446\n00:24:08.486 --> 00:24:11.345\nyou've made those addendums to your plan.\n\n447\n00:24:11.345 --> 00:24:15.660\nRonnie is there anything else we need to\ncover as far as transitioning needs to go?\n\n448\n00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.250\n>> No, not so\nmuch the idea of transitioning,\n\n449\n00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:21.220\nbut remember closing out of\nthe entire planning phase, right.\n\n450\n00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:24.850\nThe project plan itself\nis not just one document.\n\n451\n00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:28.380\nAs you've actually seen in the previous\nepisodes that we've had here, or\n\n452\n00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.100\nin other episodes that we've had.\n\n453\n00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.740\nIt actually includes a lot of small\nplans that have to essentially be\n\n454\n00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.840\nkinda coalesced together for us, so\nthat we can actually have the ability\n\n455\n00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.760\nto understand and\nhow to manage the entire project.\n\n456\n00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.375\nSo when you take a look at all the things\nthat we've talked about, right?\n\n457\n00:24:44.375 --> 00:24:48.001\nAnd whether we're talking about cost\nplanning, time planning, scope planning,\n\n458\n00:24:48.001 --> 00:24:49.030\ntransition planning.\n\n459\n00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.970\nWhatever it may be, right?\n\n460\n00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:55.090\nAll that is now actually,\nwhat we're saying here in the transition,\n\n461\n00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:59.010\nfrom this into the execution\nthat our planning is done.\n\n462\n00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:01.870\nOkay, that we are completely\ndone with that and\n\n463\n00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.880\nnow we're ready to move\non to that next phase.\n\n464\n00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.070\nSo that is the goal and idea behind\n\n465\n00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:12.300\nall the planning that we've been talking\nabout now for a lot of episodes.\n\n466\n00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.880\nSo what we're saying then,\nright, is if we get to this\n\n467\n00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.540\npoint where we're now doing\nthe transition and everything is done.\n\n468\n00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:22.820\nWe are saying that as far as project\nmanagers go that we are confident that we\n\n469\n00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:26.460\ncan move on from this project, if we're\nactually closing on the entire project.\n\n470\n00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:29.880\nOr we're confident that we can\nmove from the planning stage\n\n471\n00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:34.370\nnow into the execution and monitoring and\ncontrolling phase, as well.\n\n472\n00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:34.950\nOkay?\n\n473\n00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:38.760\nSo this is a big part of what we have\nto have to actually be able to do.\n\n474\n00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.960\nIt's easy to sit down and\n\n475\n00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:43.410\nplan out everything,\nwhen you haven't spent a dime yet.\n\n476\n00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:46.650\nWhen you can dream big and\ndo everything and\n\n477\n00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:50.420\neven though it's a headache at times,\nit's easy to do that.\n\n478\n00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:55.650\nNow we're gonna move into the point\nwhere we're taking the application\n\n479\n00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:57.560\nof those plans that we created and\n\n480\n00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.660\nactually giving them the work,\nwe're actually gonna start building stuff.\n\n481\n00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:01.870\nIs what we're taking or\n\n482\n00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:05.210\nfiguring out how to manage, while stuff\nis being built, is what I should say.\n\n483\n00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:09.370\n>> Well we look very forward to that and\nthank you so much Ronnie for\n\n484\n00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:10.850\nthis great explanations.\n\n485\n00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:12.685\nYour veritable wealth of knowledge.\n\n486\n00:26:12.685 --> 00:26:14.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> When it comes to project planning.\n\n487\n00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:18.230\nHopefully you guys out there, you got\na lot out of this and that being said,\n\n488\n00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:21.950\nlooking at the clock,\nwe've come down to end of our show here.\n\n489\n00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:22.925\nLike, hopefully.\n\n490\n00:26:22.925 --> 00:26:24.902\n[LAUGH] Having a great time here.\n\n491\n00:26:24.902 --> 00:26:26.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Enjoyed having Ronnie on the show we\n\n492\n00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.670\nagain, we thank you for stopping by.\n\n493\n00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:28.980\n>> Thank you.\n>> We thank you for watching.\n\n494\n00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.740\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n495\n00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.670\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n496\n00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:33.450\n>> And I'm Ronnie

another\nexciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.810\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.370\nAnd in today's episode we are moving\non with our Project+ series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.545\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nis that cornucopia of knowledge when it\n\n7\n00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:27.554\ncomes to project.\n\n8\n00:00:27.554 --> 00:00:29.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.500\nRonnie, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.120\n>> Well, thank you for\nhaving me back on the show.\n\n11\n00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.320\nI don't know anything about\na cornucopia of knowledge.\n\n12\n00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.340\nBut we do actually want to continue on,\nand take a look at CompTIA's Project+.\n\n13\n00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.630\nAnd what we're doing today\nis we're focusing in now.\n\n14\n00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.710\nWe're moving from the planning phase\nof our project management, and\n\n15\n00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.730\nnow we're moving in to what we\ncall the execution phase as well.\n\n16\n00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.540\nAnd when you go to CompTIA they\ntalk about it as execution and\n\n17\n00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.370\ndelivery is what you also hear.\n\n18\n00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.140\nSo we're gonna begin really right here\nwhere let's say that we know what the plan\n\n19\n00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.680\nis that we need to have.\n\n20\n00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.690\nAnd now we're ready to assemble and\nwe're ready to make sure that our team for\n\n21\n00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.570\nwhatever project they're working on is\ngonna be there and do what we want to.\n\n22\n00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.910\nThe problem that we have is fairly simple.\n\n23\n00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.660\nIs that as we start assembling our team of\n\n24\n00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.280\nresources that's gonna be\nworking on our project.\n\n25\n00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.110\nWe start to realize something\nthat there are also and\n\n26\n00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.390\nalways a lot of different\nthings that end up hindering us\n\n27\n00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.380\nfrom building the project\nteam the way that we need to.\n\n28\n00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.890\nLet's take for\nexample the idea of location, right.\n\n29\n00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.690\nYou might find out that even though you\ndo have certain people that are actually\n\n30\n00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.990\nright there with you on the site where\nyou're actually working on your project.\n\n31\n00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.990\nYou might also find out that a specialist\nthat you need working on your project\n\n32\n00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.170\nis not located right there.\n\n33\n00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.870\nThey may be located halfway\nacross the country.\n\n34\n00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.180\nVery difficult to build this very good,\n\n35\n00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.630\nsolid camaraderie when you do have team\nmembers that are actually far away.\n\n36\n00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.530\nNot saying it can't be done,\nbut you do have to take extra\n\n37\n00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.210\nspecial measures to ensure that everybody\nfeels like they are a part of the team.\n\n38\n00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.730\nThe other thing of course\nis the idea here of how\n\n39\n00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.920\nlong does that resource get\nto work on your project?\n\n40\n00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.660\nIn other words, are they a full\ntime member of your project team?\n\n41\n00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.450\nOr are they working part\ntime on your project?\n\n42\n00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.840\nRemember that even in that instance in\nthat situation, you can have humans,\n\n43\n00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.915\npeople, that actually go well I\nwork on the project full time.\n\n44\n00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:31.795\nYou only work on it part time,\nso I don't take your weight and\n\n45\n00:02:31.795 --> 00:02:35.715\nyour contribution to the project\nas being as valuable as well.\n\n46\n00:02:35.715 --> 00:02:39.295\nAnd you can see why that doesn't\nhelp to build some type of team.\n\n47\n00:02:39.295 --> 00:02:42.655\nYou can even of course have\nthe difference between technical versus\n\n48\n00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:46.770\nnon technical people on your team\nwhere there is a separation of\n\n49\n00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.850\nthings like labor versus people that\nactually do some technical designing.\n\n50\n00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.360\nAnd of course temporary roles and\nof course even the project team itself.\n\n51\n00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.890\nYou name it, there is actually\na bunch of different things\n\n52\n00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.220\nthat we have to actually worry about\nas we start building our project team.\n\n53\n00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.070\nAnd coming together, okay?\n\n54\n00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.780\nSo, one of the things that talked about\nespecially when we're about ready to do\n\n55\n00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.600\nthe execution, is the idea of how do we\nbegin to develop the team that we need?\n\n56\n00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.105\nWhat actually has to happen here and\nwhat we need to do?\n\n57\n00:03:18.105 --> 00:03:21.525\nAnd that's what we're gonna be\nspending our time in this episode or\n\n58\n00:03:21.525 --> 00:03:25.125\nmaybe even a couple of more episodes\nhere about talking about the idea of\n\n59\n00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:26.265\ndeveloping the team.\n\n60\n00:03:26.265 --> 00:03:30.966\nMaking sure that we can coordinate all\nof our human resources together to\n\n61\n00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:32.596\nmake them into one team.\n\n62\n00:03:32.596 --> 00:03:38.084\nAnd this only can come if you have\nan understanding of at least the basic\n\n63\n00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:43.493\nprocesses in how teams actually\nbegin to develop into a team itself.\n\n64\n00:03:43.493 --> 00:03:47.985\nNow if you're going man I've been through\nso many team building activities,\n\n65\n00:03:47.985 --> 00:03:51.265\nI don't care about doing them again,\nand I understand.\n\n66\n00:03:51.265 --> 00:03:55.456\nBut remember you're preparing for\nthe CompTIA Project+ exam,\n\n67\n00:03:55.456 --> 00:04:00.332\nyou do want to learn at least their kind\nof basic developmental phases that we\n\n68\n00:04:00.332 --> 00:04:05.320\nwant to talk about to make sure that\nyou understand that overall process.\n\n69\n00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.690\nBut everything that you've gone through,\nif you've been through any type of team\n\n70\n00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.300\ndevelopment types of things,\nyou're gonna go yeah, that's common sense.\n\n71\n00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.870\nBut let's learn their terminology and\nlet's make sure we understand.\n\n72\n00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.835\nSo if we have to overcome a lot of\nbarriers, why do we have to overcome a lot\n\n73\n00:04:19.835 --> 00:04:23.284\nof barriers and what happens\nbefore a team is actually formed?\n\n74\n00:04:23.284 --> 00:04:26.483\nSo we're gonna take a look at how\nthe development phases come about,\n\n75\n00:04:26.483 --> 00:04:27.650\nis what we're gonna do.\n\n76\n00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.140\nSo let's go ahead and take a look\nat my diagram on my computer, and\n\n77\n00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.170\nthis will help us out just\na little bit as well.\n\n78\n00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.180\nSo when we start taking a look here\nat the idea of development phases.\n\n79\n00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.390\nWe want to make sure that we\nunderstand that it begins with the, and\n\n80\n00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.180\nthe nice thing is,\nit's kind of a homonym here.\n\n81\n00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.200\nWe'll see that the term's forming,\nstorming, and\n\n82\n00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.420\nthen we'll also see norming and\nwe'll see a couple of other things.\n\n83\n00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.340\nBut when we start talking about forming,\nwe need to make sure that\n\n84\n00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.720\nduring this point,\nas we gather those team members together,\n\n85\n00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.710\nthat they learn why they\nare actually working together.\n\n86\n00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.690\nThe reason why is right at the beginning,\nthere is a hesitancy that's there.\n\n87\n00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.240\nThere's a reserve that's there.\n\n88\n00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.120\nThere's a formality that's there which\neverybody will approach whatever this is.\n\n89\n00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.770\nCuz they don't really feel like a team yet\nin a very formal and businesslike manner,\n\n90\n00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.610\nand you're probably saying,\nwell that's exactly what should be done.\n\n91\n00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.850\nAnd don't get me wrong\nthe idea of actually saying,\n\n92\n00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.260\nthis is a business relationship\nis absolutely 100% true.\n\n93\n00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.980\nBut if you want them to be able to\nwork like a team, together right?\n\n94\n00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.726\nWe need to at least get past that idea\nthat the formality is actually what's\n\n95\n00:05:34.726 --> 00:05:35.384\nimportant.\n\n96\n00:05:35.384 --> 00:05:40.353\nWhat really is important is that we are\nactually telling them how in the world and\n\n97\n00:05:40.353 --> 00:05:43.630\nwhy they're actually gonna\nbe learning together.\n\n98\n00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.650\nOr learning, excuse me, figuring out\nwhy they're actually working together.\n\n99\n00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.710\nSo we wanna make sure that\nthey understand that, and\n\n100\n00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.930\nthat's what the Forming process is.\n\n101\n00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.960\nIs that we give them that\ndirection right then and\n\n102\n00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.660\nthere, allow them to chew on\nit even during this time that\n\n103\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.320\nthey're a bit hesitant to\nreally show who they are, okay.\n\n104\n00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.570\nAnd you might be going why.\n\n105\n00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.570\nBecause they need something that they're\ngonna actually be able to kind of\n\n106\n00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.090\nhover around or unite around together,\nand giving them the overall purpose of\n\n107\n00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.820\nwhy they're together is\nwhy you want to do that.\n\n108\n00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.535\nIf you just bring them together and\n\n109\n00:06:16.535 --> 00:06:19.570\ngo,you're going to work together,\nwell remember, everybody has\n\n110\n00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.440\ntheir own agenda at times instead of\ngiving them agenda that you've directed.\n\n111\n00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.081\nForming is one of those keys, you want\nto form them around your agenda for\n\n112\n00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:29.181\nyour project that you're doing, okay?\n\n113\n00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:30.160\nSo it's a very important process.\n\n114\n00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.250\n>> Now, Ronnie, when you're forming the\nteams, do you emphasize their ability to\n\n115\n00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.070\nwork well together or do you emphasize\ntheir ability to do the job on the project\n\n116\n00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.720\nand, obviously, if you could get both,\nthat would be the best case scenario.\n\n117\n00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.290\nBut if you had to choose one or\nthe other, which one do you go with?\n\n118\n00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.940\n>> Yeah if you're talking about forming\nright now, we just want them to\n\n119\n00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.260\nbe able to see that yes they can\ncome together and work on that.\n\n120\n00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.050\nThen, what you're gonna see from that\npoint as we talk about the development.\n\n121\n00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.480\nIf we can get that idea of\nwhy they're working together,\n\n122\n00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.130\nokay, then we can begin to\nmove through the process.\n\n123\n00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.630\nThat's really gonna give them the other\nthings that you talked about.\n\n124\n00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.800\nSo, the next stage is a little\nbit more standoffish so\n\n125\n00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.030\nlet's take a look at this\none just briefly here too.\n\n126\n00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.050\nSo the next one that we wanna focus in on,\nlet me see if I can\n\n127\n00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:19.070\nfocus a little bit better in on this,\nis the idea of Storming.\n\n128\n00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:24.010\nNow just like it says, when you think\nabout storms that actually roll through\n\n129\n00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:28.960\nand what ends up happening here is that\nnow that they know why they're together\n\n130\n00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.920\nand what's gonna happen, normally you'll\nsee a couple of things begin to happen.\n\n131\n00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.259\nWhoever it is that's actually coming\ntogether will now either see themselves as\n\n132\n00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:40.895\nleading the team, okay,\nas an ad-hoc leader.\n\n133\n00:07:40.895 --> 00:07:43.170\nIn other words, they'll look around and\nthey'll go that's me.\n\n134\n00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.190\nThat's what we call\nalpha positioning here.\n\n135\n00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.870\nIt's that I can do this,\nI'm the one that should do this.\n\n136\n00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.948\nAnd it's at this point you\nwill have a lot of them.\n\n137\n00:07:51.948 --> 00:07:55.524\nYou'll have everybody that's ever been\nsuccessful on a project that they're now\n\n138\n00:07:55.524 --> 00:07:56.398\nworking together.\n\n139\n00:07:56.398 --> 00:07:57.518\nThey believe that they can do this.\n\n140\n00:07:57.518 --> 00:07:59.738\nPerfectly fine to do so.\n\n141\n00:07:59.738 --> 00:08:03.418\nThey need to understand where\neach of them actually are, okay.\n\n142\n00:08:03.418 --> 00:08:06.950\nYou also see the idea of jockeying for\nthat control.\n\n143\n00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.940\nSo, usually somebody will end up\nrising to that particular point where\n\n144\n00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.490\nthey will jockey for control,\nand even become confrontational.\n\n145\n00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.060\nNow the confrontation is not bad,\n\n146\n00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.120\ncuz we're gonna talk about the idea\nof conflict resolution and\n\n147\n00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.400\nwe're gonna even mention something\nthat's gonna be a little bit strange.\n\n148\n00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.270\nThe confrontation is actually the one\ntrue way to actually solve conflicts\n\n149\n00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.360\nwhen it happens.\n\n150\n00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.600\nWe're gonna talk about\nother things we can do,\n\n151\n00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.940\nbut is that particular resolution\na natural permanent process or not?\n\n152\n00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.760\nWell, believe it or not, team members\nbecoming a little bit confrontational as\n\n153\n00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.680\nlong as it's controlled, as long as they\nkeep in mind the why they're together,\n\n154\n00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.960\nit's perfectly fine to be confrontational.\n\n155\n00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.330\nIf it denigrates from that into fist\nfights, not so good at that point.\n\n156\n00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.260\nAnd there's only name calling,\nagain, not so good.\n\n157\n00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.840\nBut the idea of storming is for them to\nbe able to see amongst themselves, right.\n\n158\n00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.330\nThat hey, even though we've got a lot\nof different strong personalities,\n\n159\n00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.310\na lot of different alpha\ntypes that are out there,\n\n160\n00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:09.480\nit's okay that we have that as long\nas we realize why we're together.\n\n161\n00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.570\nAnd that we can actually work\ntogether at that point too.\n\n162\n00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.980\nSo, it's a very important process.\n\n163\n00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.550\nThey have to do this, if they're\ngonna become a cohesive unit, or\n\n164\n00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.840\na team, that's gonna end\nup working on the project.\n\n165\n00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.670\nThey've gotta figure out where\nthey're gonna stand in the project,\n\n166\n00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.700\nin relationship to one another,\nin relationship,\n\n167\n00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.970\nalso, to you as the project manager.\n\n168\n00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.060\nSo this is why it's key that you\nunderstand that you're gonna have\n\n169\n00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.850\nteams that will go though this.\n\n170\n00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:38.020\nIf you missed this part you're gonna not\nfigure out why it happened the way it did\n\n171\n00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.170\nand why your team's not actually\nas cohesive as it needs to, but\n\n172\n00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:45.020\neverybody needs to actually understand\nwhat's going to end up being their\n\n173\n00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.040\nparticular position on the overall\nproject that the majority of times,\n\n174\n00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.920\nwhen they start working with it do.\n\n175\n00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:51.720\nOkay?\n\n176\n00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.630\nSo, those are very two\nimportant processes,\n\n177\n00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.900\nespecially when we start talking\nabout developing teams, right?\n\n178\n00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.300\nSo we talked about forming.\n\n179\n00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.040\nWe've talked about storming but\nthat's not the key, right.\n\n180\n00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.830\nWhat we want them to do, is after they\nhave now began to understand who they\n\n181\n00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:13.530\nbelieve that they are,\nwe want them to come together, okay and\n\n182\n00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.770\nthis is the process that Daniel was\nmentioning, being able to actually\n\n183\n00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:21.990\nhave them start to work together,\nand when does that actually happen?\n\n184\n00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:25.380\nIt happens when they now\nstart to go all right,\n\n185\n00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.720\nhere's my comfort level\nwith working them them.\n\n186\n00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.280\nOkay?\n\n187\n00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.730\nHere's what we do, and\nhere's who I feel comfortable with, and so\n\n188\n00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:35.030\neach one will find their dynamics and\nwho they can work with.\n\n189\n00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.150\nAnd then they might find out that there\nare certain people that they can't work\n\n190\n00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.530\nwith then we'll talk about that\na little later on as well.\n\n191\n00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.310\nBut this is what we need to move to.\n\n192\n00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.090\nSo what is the third stage\nof team development?\n\n193\n00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.490\nLet's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n194\n00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.780\nOkay, it is going to be\nwhat we call norming.\n\n195\n00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.190\n>> This is following the teachings\nof a guy called Norm, right?\n\n196\n00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.300\n>> Yeah, following Norm.\n\n197\n00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:53.170\nYeah.\n\n198\n00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.480\nThat's right, yeah, Cheers, I think he's\nout at the end of the bar somewhere.\n\n199\n00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.090\n>> Right.\n\n200\n00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.520\n>> So we have that.\n\n201\n00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.980\nOkay, so norming is about this idea of\n\n202\n00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.030\nreaching a comfort level with\nthe people on your team.\n\n203\n00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.720\nNotice that what we're taking a look a,\n\n204\n00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.670\nis that at this point even though they're\nstill strong personalities the focus\n\n205\n00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:17.210\nthough is when we talk about problems\nespecially on the team it's not saying\n\n206\n00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:21.280\nI just don't like that guy Daniel, it's\nsaying well, how do we actually fix this?\n\n207\n00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.090\nAnd what we try and\ndo is we try and focus in on that.\n\n208\n00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:28.470\nAnd we work around that is\nwhat can end up happening.\n\n209\n00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.070\nNow when we start doing that right,\n\n210\n00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.210\nwe start seeing that decisions\nare gonna be made jointly.\n\n211\n00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.340\nAnd that means it maybe\nthat even though Daniel and\n\n212\n00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.090\nI can't work well together, we may\nactually come up with solution together.\n\n213\n00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:40.820\nOkay?\nBeing able to actually say,\n\n214\n00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.080\nlook here's what we need to\naccomplish I can't do it.\n\n215\n00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:44.620\nI can't do it.\n\n216\n00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.320\nLet's see who we can\nactually get to do it.\n\n217\n00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:46.820\nOkay.\n\n218\n00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.480\nThat we can both agree that,\n\n219\n00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.510\nhey, we are probably not the best people\nto do this if we were to do that.\n\n220\n00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:53.540\nAlso of course,\n\n221\n00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:58.150\nwe also show team members start to show\nwhat we call mutual responsibility.\n\n222\n00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.820\nThat means that we are willing to\ncover for one another as well.\n\n223\n00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.520\nWhen things can't be done, we do.\n\n224\n00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.270\nWe willingly step in and\nalso cover for them, and\n\n225\n00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.290\nthat is that comfort level as well.\n\n226\n00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.430\nAnd then familiarity.\n\n227\n00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:14.090\nWe move beyond the structure\nof titles with each other.\n\n228\n00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:16.630\nAnd now we are actually able to do that.\n\n229\n00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:20.870\nSo norming is a big part\nof where the team begins to\n\n230\n00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.850\nreally gel in the way that we want to.\n\n231\n00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:26.540\nNow how in the heck do you know\nthat they're really gelling?\n\n232\n00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:31.310\nIs when your team now begins to perform\nat the level it needs to perform right?\n\n233\n00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:35.140\nThe team becomes effective,\nand productive.\n\n234\n00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.080\nAnd those two have to\nactually be in combination.\n\n235\n00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.540\nYou can have a very effective\nteam that you look at and you go,\n\n236\n00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:45.280\nman I love the team I'm with,\nthey accomplish nothing, okay.\n\n237\n00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.275\nSo, just like Daniel, no, no I'm joking.\n\n238\n00:12:47.275 --> 00:12:49.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was gonna say, just like Daniel and\n\n239\n00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.150\nI when we're off to, no, not really.\n\n240\n00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.230\nWe're very productive a lot of times But,\nit has to be both.\n\n241\n00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:57.420\nThere has to be an effective\ncombination of productivity and\n\n242\n00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.070\nthe actual effective nature.\n\n243\n00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:03.390\nWe know that Daniel's up here cuz\nhe really does sit there and go,\n\n244\n00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.820\nlook, hey he brings a lot into it,\nhe makes it conversational.\n\n245\n00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.370\nHe does a lot.\n\n246\n00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:08.420\nThat's great.\n\n247\n00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.140\nBut if we're not productive, if we only\naccomplish, let's say, no shows today,\n\n248\n00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.910\nthat would be terrible.\n\n249\n00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:17.340\nSo you might go, that's a cool tam,\nRonnie and Daniel, but\n\n250\n00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.610\nthey can't do anything together.\n\n251\n00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:20.000\n>> They call us the no show [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n252\n00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.850\nThe no show guys.\n\n253\n00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:22.180\nCan't do anything those two guys.\n\n254\n00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.380\n>> Yes, but see,\nthat's where it can fall apart, right?\n\n255\n00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.190\nSo, when we start talking about\nthe ideal performance, right?\n\n256\n00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:30.800\nAnd we're looking at it from\nthe idea of team building\n\n257\n00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.560\nIt's great that the guys\nwanna be together.\n\n258\n00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.070\nIt's great that they're actually enjoying\neach other's company and willing to work.\n\n259\n00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.970\nBut it's terrible that they're\nnot actually producing anything.\n\n260\n00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.570\nThat would be terrible for us.\n\n261\n00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:45.040\nSo we need to make sure that\nthat doesn't happen either.\n\n262\n00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.270\nUsually at the performance level we\ntrust one another to finish what we say\n\n263\n00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:49.120\nwe're gonna finish too.\n\n264\n00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.290\nAnd then of course then\noverall work gets done.\n\n265\n00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:58.340\nAnd that is pretty much what we\nalso need to be able to see too.\n\n266\n00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:04.100\nNow I actually end up going beyond there\nand so now what is the last stage, okay?\n\n267\n00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:08.200\nThe last one is one of those kinda\nbittersweet moments that you have,\n\n268\n00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.820\nwhich is the adjourning.\n\n269\n00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.880\nFor a project,\nthis is very important, okay?\n\n270\n00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.080\nThat even though you bring them\ntogether to work on the team,\n\n271\n00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.790\nremember that the project's not forever,\nand it shouldn't be forever here.\n\n272\n00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.500\nBut the project becomes over and\nat this point here,\n\n273\n00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.040\nthe team is now going to dissipate.\n\n274\n00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.130\nSo we talk about adjourning,\n\n275\n00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.300\nbreaking the team up after\nthe project work is completed.\n\n276\n00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.440\nAnd we do, we need to make sure\nthat the team understands that.\n\n277\n00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.000\nIt's not that they can't hang\nout together afterwards, but\n\n278\n00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.030\nthey're not there in the working and\nconfines of a team any more.\n\n279\n00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:41.200\nAnd so that's what you normally take\na look at when you start talking about\n\n280\n00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.630\ndevelopmental processes.\n\n281\n00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.390\nEverybody's gonna go through that,\n\n282\n00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:49.860\nespecially when you actually add\npeople into the mix, and this is key.\n\n283\n00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.130\nYou can actually have\nan insanely stable team,\n\n284\n00:14:55.130 --> 00:15:00.160\nas long as the same elements\nare there from the very beginning\n\n285\n00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:05.380\nthat we start forming, storming,\nnorming, performing and adjourning.\n\n286\n00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.980\nAnd you can have a lifelong team there if\n\n287\n00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.960\neverybody's actually been in\nthere the whole time, okay?\n\n288\n00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.710\nBut what happens when a new\nperson comes in, okay?\n\n289\n00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:23.140\nWell, the way that the idea here or the\nconcept, context of team development goes,\n\n290\n00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:28.100\nis every time you add a new person in\nyou essentially start all over, okay?\n\n291\n00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.630\nSo even though you might have a team\nthat's been together for a long time, for\n\n292\n00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.510\nyears, as you add new people in, they too,\n\n293\n00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:39.000\nthey actually have to be formed into\nthe team, they have to be accepted,\n\n294\n00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.490\nthey have to actually come in and\nget in that mold of the development.\n\n295\n00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:43.940\nAnd so every time you add new and\n\n296\n00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.380\nelemental changes that's\nwhat ends up happening.\n\n297\n00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:50.830\nNow, some teams are better at being\nmore agile at accepting that.\n\n298\n00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:52.398\nSome teams are not.\n\n299\n00:15:52.398 --> 00:15:56.200\nAnd so as a project manager,\nyou've gotta look at your team and\n\n300\n00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.434\nyour development in your team And\nbe able to guide that process along,\n\n301\n00:16:00.434 --> 00:16:03.948\nif you're gonna have a solid\nteam to be able to work with for\n\n302\n00:16:03.948 --> 00:16:07.530\nwhatever project that\nyou're gonna be working on.\n\n303\n00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:11.330\nSo a very important process that we\nunderstand, at least the concepts of that,\n\n304\n00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.320\nbecause that means we as a project\nmanager, we can start taking a look at\n\n305\n00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.180\nsome other things that we need to do,\nto really build our team.\n\n306\n00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:17.820\n>> That's right.\nNow,\n\n307\n00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.950\nRonnie, once we have\nour team assembled and\n\n308\n00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:24.370\nthey're working together,\nhow do we know that this is a good team?\n\n309\n00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.250\nHow do we know that we've\nchosen the right people?\n\n310\n00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:28.870\nThey're in the right spots, they're\ndoing the things that they need to do.\n\n311\n00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.480\nAnd they are being productive, ultimately.\n\n312\n00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.870\n>> Yeah, when you start taking\na look at something like this,\n\n313\n00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:36.070\nyou do have to make sure\nthat you monitor them.\n\n314\n00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:38.480\nAnd that you start doing\na bunch of things.\n\n315\n00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.780\nBut one of the things that we want to\nactually understand is if we need to build\n\n316\n00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:45.950\nthat team, we need to know that they're\ngonna go through this entire process.\n\n317\n00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:50.800\nBut the idea of team building is the next\nportion that we really need to focus in on\n\n318\n00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.560\nto ensure that they are really\ngonna fit in wherever we want them\n\n319\n00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.920\nto actually fit into.\n\n320\n00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.550\nOkay?\n\n321\n00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.900\nSo this is where we move into\nthat idea of what we call\n\n322\n00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.080\nteam building just a little bit.\n\n323\n00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.250\nNow, this is more common\nsense than anything else.\n\n324\n00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:07.610\nThat we realize once we get\na group of people together and\n\n325\n00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.870\nthey figure out that they can\nbe comfortable with each other.\n\n326\n00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:11.570\nWhere do we put them together?\n\n327\n00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:14.550\nAnd then how can we actually see them\nwork in the way that we want them to?\n\n328\n00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:18.220\nAnd that's the concepts of team\nbuilding is what we are focusing on.\n\n329\n00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.310\nWe're not gonna take\na tremendous amount of time.\n\n330\n00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.810\nBut we do wanna look at the idea\nof some formal activities and\n\n331\n00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:28.750\nof course informal activities in\nterms of team building as well, okay.\n\n332\n00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:33.100\nSo when it comes down to the formal\nactivities of team building,\n\n333\n00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:37.340\nthere's a couple of them that we\nneed to be able to see here, okay?\n\n334\n00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:41.310\nSo if you begin with understanding\nthat development cycle,\n\n335\n00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.040\nwhen you are actually in that forming and\nthat storming.\n\n336\n00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.210\nIn other words, when there's kind of\nrocky situation that people are trying to\n\n337\n00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:52.220\nfind their place and fit in,\nformal activities are really good, okay.\n\n338\n00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:55.920\nAnd this includes the stuff that you\nhear about in movies that never work.\n\n339\n00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.580\n>> Trust falling.\n\n340\n00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.698\n>> Yeah, trust falling.\n\n341\n00:17:57.698 --> 00:17:59.940\nHey, whoop [LAUGH].\n\n342\n00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.330\nYou start seeing that.\n\n343\n00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.860\nBut it actually is as anything here, okay.\n\n344\n00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.340\nBut in a formal activity it says,\nany activity that includes everyone and\n\n345\n00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.170\nallows everyone to get know team members,\nokay.\n\n346\n00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:13.510\nSo it's not just designed around\nthe strength of Daniel, okay.\n\n347\n00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.505\nNot just designed around my strength here.\n\n348\n00:18:15.505 --> 00:18:19.540\nIt's actually designed to make sure\nthat everybody can participate and\n\n349\n00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.070\nthe key here, right.\n\n350\n00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:24.940\nIs that you as the project manager\nis seen as leading it, okay.\n\n351\n00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:30.740\nSo you don't want the person, excuse me,\nthat's becoming the positioning alpha.\n\n352\n00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:34.140\nIn other words, he's actually putting\nhimself as being the team leader.\n\n353\n00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.760\nYou don't want him doing that.\n\n354\n00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.378\nYou're the one that's\ngonna be leading that.\n\n355\n00:18:37.378 --> 00:18:40.760\nThat really shows that you\nare the project manager.\n\n356\n00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.170\nAnd that you are leading your team.\n\n357\n00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:44.960\nSo what does this mean of you?\n\n358\n00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.820\nIt means you've gotta be a coach.\n\n359\n00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:50.790\nYou've gotta be the guy that\nwillingly pulls a person up.\n\n360\n00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.760\nTo get them involved in this\nas a physical activity.\n\n361\n00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.260\nYou can't just sit there on the side and\nwatch as it actually happens.\n\n362\n00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.650\nBut the idea of coaching\nhere is insanely important\n\n363\n00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.280\nif you really want a cohesive team.\n\n364\n00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:02.860\n>> Yeah, Ronnie.\n\n365\n00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:06.070\nI've done actually a few\nof these formal activities,\n\n366\n00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:10.410\nthese formal training sessions where\nwe try to build our teams up and\n\n367\n00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:13.000\nto be honest with you,\nyou think that they are kinda silly.\n\n368\n00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.540\nThey start like [INAUDIBLE] in TVs and\nmovies and\n\n369\n00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:20.020\nthey make them look ridiculous for\nthe purposes of being funny.\n\n370\n00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.170\nBut they can be very constructive.\n\n371\n00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.250\nA lot of times there's a breakdown\nin communication between people\n\n372\n00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.925\nbecause of personality conflicts or\nany other reason to be honest with you.\n\n373\n00:19:28.925 --> 00:19:30.260\nAnd to get beyond that,\n\n374\n00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:34.100\nyou have to be able to work well\nwith people that you don't like.\n\n375\n00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.620\nOr you have to work better with\nthe people that you do like.\n\n376\n00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.950\nHow do you build those up?\n\n377\n00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.320\nThese formal activities are great for\nthat.\n\n378\n00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.920\nBecause they allow you\nto say you know what,\n\n379\n00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:47.170\ndon't worry about making\nanybody uncomfortable.\n\n380\n00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.980\nWe're here to get beyond\nwhatever our conflicts are.\n\n381\n00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.970\nAnd once you get pass that you\nare a level in ability to work together\n\n382\n00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.810\neven though you still probably\ndon't like each other at least you\n\n383\n00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:01.000\nbetter understand each other\ncreating a better work atmosphere.\n\n384\n00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.440\nI now know how Ronnie\nexpects to be treated.\n\n385\n00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.890\nAnd if I didn't know that before,\nthat could be causing an issue.\n\n386\n00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:11.800\nThat could be causing us to not work well\nand productivity's going to be down.\n\n387\n00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.780\nOnce we get beyond that,\nnow I know how he expects to be treated,\n\n388\n00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.240\nI can treat him in that way and\nhe'll be more productive.\n\n389\n00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.140\nHe'll be more receptive of\ntasks I need him to do and\n\n390\n00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.840\nprojects that we work on together.\n\n391\n00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.050\nSo don't discount formal activities.\n\n392\n00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:30.980\nThey do work, you just have to\nkinda put all your chips in and\n\n393\n00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.400\nsay, I'm going to do this.\n\n394\n00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.090\nI'm gonna make it work because\nI want our project to succeed.\n\n395\n00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:39.920\n>> The more often, also, that you do\nend up adding in new team members,\n\n396\n00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:44.650\nthe more often you wanna do some\nformalized type of team building, okay?\n\n397\n00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:45.930\nAnd you may say we'll why?\n\n398\n00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:49.830\nIt's because that person also needs\nto feel like they're a team and\n\n399\n00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.930\nthat people are willing to work with them.\n\n400\n00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:55.050\nAnd they need to understand where\nthey work in the process too.\n\n401\n00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:59.280\nSo, normally in these types of situations\nwith the formal type of activity, you may\n\n402\n00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.050\nwork on some like a communication activity\nlike what Daniel was talking about.\n\n403\n00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:06.010\n>> Or you may work on a coordination\nactivity where something is actually\n\n404\n00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:09.820\npassed from one person to another while\nthey're doing something strange like\n\n405\n00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:12.090\nhaving to walk on a log with a raw egg.\n\n406\n00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:16.060\nAnd actually being able to toss the egg,\nwhatever it might be,\n\n407\n00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.830\nto one another without breaking it.\n\n408\n00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.870\nBut it's the idea of actually\ngetting the stuff done that you\n\n409\n00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:23.015\nknow is gonna need to happen\nin your project, right?\n\n410\n00:21:23.015 --> 00:21:25.720\nIf great communication\nbetween your team members,\n\n411\n00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.440\nespecially when the working work package\nis important, you spend more time doing,\n\n412\n00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.980\nwell, team building activities that\nare actually communications based.\n\n413\n00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.480\nAnd it's about the idea of coordination or\nlogistics, right.\n\n414\n00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.260\nYou do things that actually allow them\nto put things in the proper order\n\n415\n00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.570\nto make sure that the process is\nmoved in the way that you want to.\n\n416\n00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.990\nSo you can come up with a ton of\ndifferent ideas to help you out, but\n\n417\n00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.860\nhaving a formal process,\nespecially when new people come on,\n\n418\n00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:56.740\nis the best way to begin to integrate new\npeople a lot faster at a lot quicker rate.\n\n419\n00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.620\nIf you want them just to muddle along,\nthe new person to muddle along and\n\n420\n00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.310\njust figure out where he comes in,\nyou can do that by\n\n421\n00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:06.180\njust simply assigning him to part of\nthe team and watching him struggle.\n\n422\n00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.100\nBut if you really actually\nwant to build a team, so\n\n423\n00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.480\nthat both sides are actually equally\ninvolved in it, team building\n\n424\n00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.740\nis gonna be one of the fastest ways\nthat you can do so that will help you\n\n425\n00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.325\nincorporate a new member, and will help,\nof course, that, that older part of\n\n426\n00:22:18.325 --> 00:22:21.490\nthe team to feel like the new members\nare also a part of the team as well.\n\n427\n00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:23.260\nAnd not the new guys just\ntrying to figure out,\n\n428\n00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.440\nwhat do I hang on to\nduring this few weeks?\n\n429\n00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.010\nOkay?\n\n430\n00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:29.080\nNow, once you get that done, right?\n\n431\n00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.040\nIt doesn't mean that throughout\nthe rest of the project you go,\n\n432\n00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.600\nokay, team building is done,\nit should be able to work perfectly.\n\n433\n00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.680\nIt's not going to work that way, okay.\n\n434\n00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.810\nYou still have to actually do a little\nbit more on team building, but\n\n435\n00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:43.070\nnow it can actually turn into more\ninformal activities as well, okay.\n\n436\n00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.970\nSo during the norming and\nthe performing stage\n\n437\n00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:49.990\nwhen we start taking a look at right,\nyou're gonna end up seeing that stuff\n\n438\n00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:54.710\ndoesn't have to actually be as\nformal if your team is static, okay.\n\n439\n00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:58.440\nSo yes you know you're gonna be working\nwith the same people all the time,\n\n440\n00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.970\nit's more of an encouragement\nthan anything else.\n\n441\n00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:05.410\nAnd just checking in to see that they\nunderstand that you really are monitoring\n\n442\n00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:09.510\nthe project and that you're still actually\nthere to make sure everything is working.\n\n443\n00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:11.990\nSo, things like team lunches, okay.\n\n444\n00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:13.000\nDonuts.\n\n445\n00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.840\nEverybody loves donuts,\nyou may not, but I love donuts.\n\n446\n00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.280\n>> You can tell, we both love donuts.\n\n447\n00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.690\n>> Yeah, I love donuts.\n\n448\n00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:23.030\nAnything like that shows that you actually\ndid take time out of your schedule.\n\n449\n00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.380\nTo bring something in for\nyour team, it does.\n\n450\n00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:30.390\nIt builds a little bit of a nice,\ninformal way to say guys,\n\n451\n00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:32.300\nI'm thinking about you this morning, okay.\n\n452\n00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.930\nNow, I put beers after work.\n\n453\n00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:37.240\nThat's always a great one,\nas long as everybody does do the drinking.\n\n454\n00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.080\nBut the person that doesn't,\n\n455\n00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.829\nfeels a little bit left out unless\nyou can say just come along and\n\n456\n00:23:42.829 --> 00:23:46.888\ngrab yourself a soda or milk,\nif you want to, whatever it might be.\n\n457\n00:23:46.888 --> 00:23:49.849\nBut the idea is what,\nis saying look, even after work,\n\n458\n00:23:49.849 --> 00:23:53.629\nyou wanna share a little bit of time,\nsee how they're actually doing,\n\n459\n00:23:53.629 --> 00:23:57.868\nverify that everything's actually going\nwell, any concerns that are there.\n\n460\n00:23:57.868 --> 00:23:59.979\nAnd you can,\nyou can still talk about work,\n\n461\n00:23:59.979 --> 00:24:02.618\nyou just don't want to talk\nabout it in insane detail.\n\n462\n00:24:02.618 --> 00:24:06.013\nYou just wanna make sure that they\nunderstand that you are trying to make\n\n463\n00:24:06.013 --> 00:24:09.080\nsure that the team is still\nworking as a team together.\n\n464\n00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.290\nSo you'll see this more\nduring this norming and\n\n465\n00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:14.690\nperforming stage where it really does\nhelp morale more than anything else.\n\n466\n00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.050\n>> Yeah, it does do that.\n\n467\n00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:17.080\nYou guys have to get together.\n\n468\n00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.420\nYou have to build up the communication.\n\n469\n00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.560\nIt's always about communication.\n\n470\n00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.590\nAnd what it all boils down\nto at the end of the day.\n\n471\n00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:29.180\nSo don't be afraid to hang out after\nwork and talk about the project,\n\n472\n00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.850\nthings that you're frustrated about.\n\n473\n00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:34.970\nGet that junk off your chest,\nbecause that's gonna help build the team,\n\n474\n00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:38.480\nbuild the cohesiveness,\nmake you guys in lock step.\n\n475\n00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.560\nI know exactly where\nRonnie's at in this project.\n\n476\n00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:44.510\nI know that this one thing he's having to\ndo is frustrating him out of his mind.\n\n477\n00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:47.240\nYou know what I'm gonna out of my way,\nI'm gonna take him out to lunch today.\n\n478\n00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.280\nHelp relieve some of that stress.\n\n479\n00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.520\nLet him vent to you.\n\n480\n00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.840\nThings like that can be a big help\nwhen it comes to team building and\n\n481\n00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.630\ngetting people to work well together,\n\n482\n00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:58.970\nwhich is gonna drive up that\nproductivity through the roof.\n\n483\n00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:00.805\nRonnie, I'm looking at our clock.\n\n484\n00:25:00.805 --> 00:25:02.470\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We've got a little bit of time left.\n\n485\n00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:03.270\n>> Right.\n\n486\n00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:05.230\n>> We need to get into monitoring.\n\n487\n00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:06.870\n>> We do.\n>> Do we have enough time for it, or\n\n488\n00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:07.640\nshould we wait for the next?\n\n489\n00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.380\n>> Well, let's go ahead and\ntalk about it here and\n\n490\n00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.586\nthen we'll go ahead and\nwe'll take a break after this.\n\n491\n00:25:12.586 --> 00:25:14.300\n[LAUGH] And then we'll end up doing.\n\n492\n00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.730\nSo what else does have to happen then?\n\n493\n00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:19.910\nOkay, it's great to have\na team that feels cohesive.\n\n494\n00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:24.068\nIt's great to actually have the team\nunderstand well, a couple of things.\n\n495\n00:25:24.068 --> 00:25:25.690\nWe want them to be effective.\n\n496\n00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.840\nWe want them to be able to perform.\n\n497\n00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.080\nWe want to encourage them to do that\nas a project manager that's really our\n\n498\n00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.280\njob and our goal.\n\n499\n00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.810\nBecause we know something,\nif they're actually working as a team and\n\n500\n00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:39.400\nthey're being effective and productive,\nwell then we know that there's more than\n\n501\n00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.680\na likely chance that our\nproject is gonna get done\n\n502\n00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.970\nin the manner that we want it done and\non time that we want it done as well.\n\n503\n00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:51.760\nBut, there's always a but to it,\nwe have to make sure that we can actually\n\n504\n00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:56.420\nmonitor the progress and of course,\nthe performance of our team members too.\n\n505\n00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:01.009\nNow the reason why we want to, right,\nis that Daniel actually just mentioned it,\n\n506\n00:26:01.009 --> 00:26:03.083\nthat the idea here is fairly simple.\n\n507\n00:26:03.083 --> 00:26:07.850\nWhen there is a visible note from\nsomeone on our project team that says,\n\n508\n00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:12.780\nhey, Ronnie is really struggling\nwith this and having a bad time.\n\n509\n00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.113\nAnd he takes it on himself to say,\nlet me just take Ronnie out to lunch.\n\n510\n00:26:15.113 --> 00:26:17.500\nAnd maybe we kind of let the steam off and\ndo that.\n\n511\n00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.180\nThat's perfectly fine.\n\n512\n00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.730\nBut the problem is this.\n\n513\n00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:24.680\nDuring that time, you don't know how far\nRonnie's performance may have dropped.\n\n514\n00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.860\nIt can happen.\n\n515\n00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:30.080\nSo what you need to do then is to have\nsome structure in place that actually\n\n516\n00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:35.420\ngives you this ability to monitor\nthe team in several different ways.\n\n517\n00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.970\nSo one of the things that you want to make\nsure that you understand when we start\n\n518\n00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:43.120\ntalking about the idea of monitoring\nhere is that a project manager allows\n\n519\n00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:47.790\ntheir team members to kinda have a freedom\nof choice in a lot of things that they do,\n\n520\n00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.050\nso they don't do over micromanage things.\n\n521\n00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:55.200\nBut at the same time, it has to also\nbe able to explain to the team member\n\n522\n00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.640\nlike Ronnie that may be falling behind,\nthat you still expect productivity.\n\n523\n00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.840\nAnd the way that you actually\nclarify that, believe it or not,\n\n524\n00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:07.540\nis actually having a good performance\nmonitoring in place, okay?\n\n525\n00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:11.390\nIn this type of performance monitoring,\nwhether it's somebody walking around,\n\n526\n00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:14.460\nwhether it's actually daily\nreports that come in,\n\n527\n00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.510\nwhatever it is,\nyou want to make sure that any time\n\n528\n00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:22.560\nthat you are trying to do the performance\nmantra, that everything is clear here.\n\n529\n00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.750\nYou wanna make sure that everybody\nunderstands what the expectations are.\n\n530\n00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:29.720\nIf this is a daily expectation, make sure\nyou tell them, it's a daily expectation.\n\n531\n00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.760\nSo for example,\nwe put a daily expectation ourselves at\n\n532\n00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.200\nwe're gonna produce three shows a day,\nat least, okay.\n\n533\n00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.110\nYou may produce four sometimes\nwhich is really great.\n\n534\n00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.820\nBut it's should be at least three.\n\n535\n00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.530\nWhen I don't produce three,\nI don't feel good about that day.\n\n536\n00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:45.210\nAnd then I try and look for\nways I can make that up, okay?\n\n537\n00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:48.300\nSo you wanna make sure that\nthe performance expectations are there.\n\n538\n00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.850\nYou also need a way that\nclearly marks this point here,\n\n539\n00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:56.000\nwhere you actually start seeing\nthe inadequate performance behaviors.\n\n540\n00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.920\nWell, for\nus on the show it makes it very easy for\n\n541\n00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:03.080\nus here, which is, we didn't get three,\nwell why didn't we?\n\n542\n00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.000\nAnd try and figure out what it is,\nwhat areas are actually lacking.\n\n543\n00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.770\nIs it me not getting up there on time,\ngetting ready to go?\n\n544\n00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.720\nOr is it something else that's actually\npreventing us from doing that.\n\n545\n00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.830\nSo there has to be a way\nthat we can measure that,\n\n546\n00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.190\nthat we can actually look at it.\n\n547\n00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.200\nAs a project manager you do too.\n\n548\n00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:22.760\nYou need to have a way that you can say,\nthis is actually a performance problem,\n\n549\n00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.400\nit's not a defect problem,\nit's not a problem with missing equipment.\n\n550\n00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.660\nThis is a performance issue\nthat ends up happening and so\n\n551\n00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.500\nyou will also got to be doing that too.\n\n552\n00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.650\nThe other things of course,\ntalk about rewards as well as,\n\n553\n00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:38.370\nof course, reprimands, okay?\n\n554\n00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:41.340\nNow when you talk about the idea of\nrewards especially if the performance\n\n555\n00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:46.860\nis superior, the recommendation here\nis of course that these rewards can be,\n\n556\n00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.140\nand a lot of times maybe should be\ndone publicly in front of their peers\n\n557\n00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:55.120\nto let them know that yes, I do recognize\nthat as being superior performance.\n\n558\n00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.690\nBut they don't recommend that for\nreprimands.\n\n559\n00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:02.120\nIn other words, reprimands that are done\npublicly usually are not ever taken well,\n\n560\n00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.500\nas far as I know.\n\n561\n00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:08.140\nI know I've never actually taken\nanything like that very well at all.\n\n562\n00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.660\nBut the idea of doing this privately\nactually shows what, well, kind of\n\n563\n00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:17.100\na compassion here that you understand that\nthat person is not performing as well.\n\n564\n00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.250\nBut you're also saying what I\nneed you to perform well, and\n\n565\n00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:22.510\nlet's get this back online here, okay.\n\n566\n00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:26.060\nBut you're not doing it in front of\neverybody to actually provide more\n\n567\n00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.290\nheaping on their shoulders\nthan they can handle.\n\n568\n00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:30.250\nAnd sometimes you just don't know,\n\n569\n00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:33.620\nespecially when you think everything is\non your shoulders as project manager.\n\n570\n00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.280\n>> Yeah,\nplus when you reward people in public,\n\n571\n00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:38.400\nwhat does it do to the rest of the team?\n\n572\n00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.520\nIt builds them up,\nthey think wow man, if we\n\n573\n00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.880\nperform at a higher than expected level,\nwe're gonna get some sort of incentive.\n\n574\n00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.170\nThere's an incentive and they're\ngonna be jazzed up and ready to go.\n\n575\n00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:51.065\nIf you reprimand someone\nin front of everyone.\n\n576\n00:29:51.065 --> 00:29:52.020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're\n\n577\n00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:56.280\ngonna feel the tension in the room\nget super thick, super quick.\n\n578\n00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.285\nAnd that is not what you want.\n\n579\n00:29:57.285 --> 00:30:00.990\nAnd everybody's production\nis actually gonna hinder it,\n\n580\n00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:03.960\ncuz even though they feel like I'm\nsticking my nose to the grindstone, in\n\n581\n00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:07.560\nthe back of their head they're constantly\nworrying, their anxieties go up.\n\n582\n00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.400\nAnd then the cohesion of the team\nstarts to break down, because\n\n583\n00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.470\nnow all they worry about is getting\nwhat they're supposed to do done and\n\n584\n00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:17.570\nnot interacting with their team members,\nhelping them, everybody working together.\n\n585\n00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:20.180\nCommunication breaks down,\neverything breaks down.\n\n586\n00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.460\nProductivity drops.\n\n587\n00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:22.250\nBad case scenario.\n\n588\n00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:24.970\nDo the reprimanding\nbehind closed doors and\n\n589\n00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:27.800\nthen try to build everybody\nup in front of everyone.\n\n590\n00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:31.500\n>> And Daniel, you bring up a great point\nhere about the communication break down.\n\n591\n00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.110\nThe problem is,\nif that person is performing poorly,\n\n592\n00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:36.170\nhe isn't gonna communicate\nthe way that he needs to.\n\n593\n00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:39.250\nAnd so the rest of your team is\nalso gonna suffer some performance,\n\n594\n00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.570\nespecially if he's an integral\npart of that team.\n\n595\n00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:44.660\nBut even worse for\nyou as a project manager is this,\n\n596\n00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:48.570\nis your communication now,\nyou stop actually getting communication.\n\n597\n00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:52.720\nThe person that gets reprimanded publicly\ndoesn't feel like communicating with\n\n598\n00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.247\nthe person that reprimanded them.\n\n599\n00:30:54.247 --> 00:30:57.560\nAnd so a lot of times where you might\nhave actually gotten a steady stream of\n\n600\n00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.700\ngood information on the performance\nof your work package or\n\n601\n00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.110\nwhatever it is at that point.\n\n602\n00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:04.380\nYou might find that now you get zero.\n\n603\n00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:08.330\nYou get nothing, you know,\nas any type of indication and so\n\n604\n00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:10.490\nnow you actually come in and\n\n605\n00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:15.200\nnow you start to do more micro-managing\nthan you though you should need to.\n\n606\n00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.490\nBut you believe that that's\nthe only way to accomplish that.\n\n607\n00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:20.165\nWhen what might have actually been\na little bit easier is simple,\n\n608\n00:31:20.165 --> 00:31:24.590\nis to understand that in this process of\nmonitoring here, that even a reprimand\n\n609\n00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:27.510\nactually need to take into\nconsideration who you're reprimanding.\n\n610\n00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:30.520\nAnd a lot of times doing that in\nprivate is gonna be more productive\n\n611\n00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.630\nthan ever doing it publicly\nis the other one too.\n\n612\n00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:37.178\nAlso, you need to let people know that\nthere are consequences to their choices\n\n613\n00:31:37.178 --> 00:31:38.830\nfor their performance as well.\n\n614\n00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.240\nOkay, the very fact is,\n\n615\n00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.450\nsometimes there are people that say,\nI'll do my bare minimum.\n\n616\n00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:46.338\nAnd you can tell them,\nyou need to tell them as project manager,\n\n617\n00:31:46.338 --> 00:31:47.258\nthat is not enough.\n\n618\n00:31:47.258 --> 00:31:52.118\nAt this stage in our project, we need\neverybody to actually perform better or\n\n619\n00:31:52.118 --> 00:31:55.798\nto actually perform more than\nthey've ever done before.\n\n620\n00:31:55.798 --> 00:31:59.683\nBut somebody that's willing just to glide\nalong at whatever level they're willing to\n\n621\n00:31:59.683 --> 00:32:00.328\nglide along.\n\n622\n00:32:00.328 --> 00:32:04.358\nIf it's not because they\ncan't do any better, okay?\n\n623\n00:32:04.358 --> 00:32:07.998\nIf they're actually just dragging their\nfeet because they feel like they need easy\n\n624\n00:32:07.998 --> 00:32:09.506\ntime, well, at this point here,\n\n625\n00:32:09.506 --> 00:32:13.060\nyou need to let them know that there\nare consequences to their choices.\n\n626\n00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:14.480\nAnd you don't have to let them know,\nagain, in public.\n\n627\n00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.472\nYou kinda let them know,\n\n628\n00:32:15.472 --> 00:32:18.940\nI don't know why you're just doing this\ncuz you know it can be done better.\n\n629\n00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.430\nYou need to actually go,\nhere's what's gonna happen here.\n\n630\n00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:25.526\nWe're not gonna make this deadline and\nthat's gonna be dire straits for us, okay?\n\n631\n00:32:25.526 --> 00:32:29.505\nAnd of course, any time that you're doing\nthis, whether you're doing it with regular\n\n632\n00:32:29.505 --> 00:32:33.113\nperformance monitoring where you actually\ngive yearly performance reviews,\n\n633\n00:32:33.113 --> 00:32:35.608\nmonthly performance reviews,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n634\n00:32:35.608 --> 00:32:38.713\nMake sure you provide timely feedback,\nokay.\n\n635\n00:32:38.713 --> 00:32:43.554\nThe idea of giving people performance\nreviews on projects, great idea, okay,\n\n636\n00:32:43.554 --> 00:32:46.600\nreally a great idea, and should be done.\n\n637\n00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.030\nBut the idea of saying,\nI'm gonna do a performance review, and\n\n638\n00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:52.290\nthen never do it, not a great idea, okay.\n\n639\n00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:55.916\nBecause people really, a lot of people,\nreally want, I'm not gonna say everybody.\n\n640\n00:32:55.916 --> 00:32:58.940\nI always keep saying everybody and\nthen somebody, I don't want one of those.\n\n641\n00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.370\nBut a lot of people, right,\nthey wanna know whether or\n\n642\n00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:04.320\nnot they're doing the job that they\nbelieve that they're doing well.\n\n643\n00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.018\nEspecially if they believe that they're\ndoing well, and now you're the project\n\n644\n00:33:07.018 --> 00:33:09.380\nmanager that comes in and goes,\nwe're gonna do a performance review.\n\n645\n00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:12.320\nWe're gonna talk about here's where we\nbelieve are great things that you do,\n\n646\n00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.750\nand here's what you do that\nare poor things, or not as great.\n\n647\n00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:17.750\nAnd then you never actually come\nthrough and you tell them that,\n\n648\n00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:20.060\nand so they don't know.\n\n649\n00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.850\nAnd they kinda get stuck in\nlimbo cuz they're wondering,\n\n650\n00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:24.490\nis this actually tied to something else?\n\n651\n00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:25.980\nWhat else is going on here?\n\n652\n00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.849\nSo make sure that you,\nas a project manager,\n\n653\n00:33:27.849 --> 00:33:30.752\nwhen you start talking about the idea\nof monitoring for performance,\n\n654\n00:33:30.752 --> 00:33:33.771\ngive timely feedback if you're\nactually gonna do something like that.\n\n655\n00:33:33.771 --> 00:33:37.726\nDon't sit there and go, I'll decide\nthat day after day, later on, later on,\n\n656\n00:33:37.726 --> 00:33:38.270\nlater on.\n\n657\n00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:41.470\nIf you actually tell somebody you're\ngonna make a decision, make sure you make\n\n658\n00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:45.690\na decision, cuz that's part of how they're\ngonna actually start performing, as well.\n\n659\n00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:48.350\nLonger that you wait to do that,\nthe more that their performance is gonna\n\n660\n00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:52.030\ncontinue to dive downhill and\nthey're not gonna get things done.\n\n661\n00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:55.850\nSo we do need to make sure that we\nunderstand at least this process here.\n\n662\n00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:58.960\nThat it does involve a lot, right,\nwhen you start building a team.\n\n663\n00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.020\nYou gotta know how the team really\ndoes come together psychologically,\n\n664\n00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.460\nwhich is what we talked about.\n\n665\n00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.330\nWhat are ways we can build that team.\n\n666\n00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:09.050\nAnd also, how do we actually start\nmeasuring the performance of that team.\n\n667\n00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:12.070\nAnd that way we can keep\nthem on track as a team too.\n\n668\n00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:16.425\n>> That's it, wise words from our\nlovely sage here, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n669\n00:34:16.425 --> 00:34:19.231\nThat being said,\nwe have plenty more topics to cover, but\n\n670\n00:34:19.231 --> 00:34:20.730\nno time in which to cover them.\n\n671\n00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.675\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> At least in this episode.\n\n672\n00:34:22.675 --> 00:34:24.400\nWe got plenty of time in another episode,\n\n673\n00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.965\nhopefully we'll see you\nthere in the part two.\n\n674\n00:34:26.965 --> 00:34:29.535\nRonnie, thanks for dropping by,\nwe'll see you there as well.\n\n675\n00:34:29.535 --> 00:34:32.755\nEverybody here, thanks for watching,\nwe're gonna go ahead sign off for ITProTV.\n\n676\n00:34:32.755 --> 00:34:34.362\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n677\n00:34:34.362 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.300\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.798\nin today's episode we're actually\ncontinuing on with our Project+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.798 --> 00:00:25.780\nWe're going in to part two, joining\nus back into the studio again today\n\n6\n00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.527\nis none other than our good friend and\nour leader, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:30.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Ronnie, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.690\n>> Well thank you again for\n\n9\n00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.330\nhaving me back on the show as we\ncontinue on with CompTIA's Project+.\n\n10\n00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.010\nWe are taking a look at part two in\ncoordinating our human resources to try\n\n11\n00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.950\nand get the most that we can out of them\nwithout actually making them our slaves,\n\n12\n00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.680\nI guess, more than anything else.\n\n13\n00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.530\nWe really can't,\nwe can't demand that they actually\n\n14\n00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.830\ndo what we really want them\nto in this day and age.\n\n15\n00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.497\nI guess we could if we\nforce some type of slavery.\n\n16\n00:00:51.497 --> 00:00:52.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But we're not gonna do that.\n\n17\n00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.500\n>> Indentured servitude?\n\n18\n00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.640\n>> Indentured servitude,\nsomething that we might choose to do, but\n\n19\n00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.190\nin our ability here as project managers,\nwe shouldn't have to resort to that.\n\n20\n00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.420\nWhat we should actually be able\nto do of course is take a look at\n\n21\n00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.330\nwhat we can do and we've already talked\nabout these in a previous episode here.\n\n22\n00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.370\nWe talked about the idea\nof team building and\n\n23\n00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.595\nof course understanding how teams\nreally do end up getting developed.\n\n24\n00:01:14.595 --> 00:01:17.560\nAnd focus around the psychology\nof that team and\n\n25\n00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.410\nwhat has to happen there but we did take a\nlook at that as well as some performance.\n\n26\n00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.970\nBut one of the other things that we\ncan also do to help provide some\n\n27\n00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.810\nteam cohesiveness here, is to make\nsure that we provide adequate and\n\n28\n00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.810\nproper training for what our team needs\nto be able to accomplish as well.\n\n29\n00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.560\nNow when we start talking about this idea,\n\n30\n00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.850\ntraining is a big part of what\nreally does bring a team together.\n\n31\n00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.973\nIf you can train them together, if you\ncan actually give them what they need,\n\n32\n00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:49.038\nit allows them to have the tool\nsets that they need so\n\n33\n00:01:49.038 --> 00:01:52.830\nthat they can make decisions without\nhaving to come to you each and every time.\n\n34\n00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.290\nSo when we start talking about\nthe idea of team training,\n\n35\n00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.120\nthere are several elements we need\nto consider, and let's go ahead and\n\n36\n00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.120\ntake a look at my diagram\nthat will help us out here\n\n37\n00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.650\nto focus in on some of the understanding\nand issues that we need to take a look at.\n\n38\n00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.310\nFirst and foremost,\nas you provide team training,\n\n39\n00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.120\nwhat you wanna make sure that you do is\nyou understand the team member skill sets.\n\n40\n00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.000\nThere are some people that you're\ngonna provide training for\n\n41\n00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.500\nthat really don't need the training.\n\n42\n00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.550\nThere are some people you\nneed to provide training for\n\n43\n00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.780\nthat absolutely do need the training.\n\n44\n00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.680\nIt doesn't necessarily mean that\nyou have to all lump them together.\n\n45\n00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.720\nYou might actually take\na little bit more time and\n\n46\n00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.120\ndo some type of evaluation that allows you\n\n47\n00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.398\nto actually know where the training\nshould be done and what needs to be done.\n\n48\n00:02:38.398 --> 00:02:41.510\nAnd everybody feels like they\nare getting the training that they need\n\n49\n00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.210\nthat's adequate for them.\n\n50\n00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.110\nAll of us have done this before, where\nwe've had to sit through training just\n\n51\n00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.350\nbecause we had to sit\nthrough the training.\n\n52\n00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.480\nWhy, because everybody else was sitting\nthrough the training and that can be just\n\n53\n00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.820\nas frustrating as the person that\nreally is enjoying the training and\n\n54\n00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.980\nyour just sitting there kind of\nmouthing off or doing whatever you\n\n55\n00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.560\nthink you're doing and not being\na distraction, when you really are.\n\n56\n00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.560\nSo you actually want to take into\naccount the idea of member skill sets,\n\n57\n00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.710\nto see whether or not there is\ntraining that needs to be done.\n\n58\n00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.860\nThe majority of times,\nespecially on a brand new project\n\n59\n00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.640\nwhen you do know that people\nare coming from different areas,\n\n60\n00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.540\nproviding training is a very good concept\nfor us to focus in on in team building.\n\n61\n00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.810\nThe other thing of course, it makes sure\nthat it focuses on the skills needed for\n\n62\n00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.160\nthe project.\n\n63\n00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.740\nNow, we've already talked about\nthis before in several other areas,\n\n64\n00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.970\nyou can actually get very distracted\nhere when you provide for training.\n\n65\n00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.300\nSomebody says, we also need to have\nthis training, we need to have that.\n\n66\n00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.280\nAnd now instead of actually doing what\nreally does help you on your project,\n\n67\n00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.100\nyou end up providing\nevery other training but\n\n68\n00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.750\nthe training that really is gonna help\npeople out on their project as well.\n\n69\n00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.380\nNow sometimes you may have to\nprovide specialized training and\n\n70\n00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.470\nif you do, make sure you provide that.\n\n71\n00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.240\nIt never, I shouldn't say never,\nwhat tends to actually drive a team\n\n72\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.476\napart a little bit more is when you end up\nwith a team member that feels like he's\n\n73\n00:04:04.476 --> 00:04:09.090\ninadequately prepared for\nwhatever is his been assigned, and he has\n\n74\n00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.740\nno recourse to get the information that he\nneeds and so he struggles through that.\n\n75\n00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.180\nAnd other people may try\nto help out if they can but\n\n76\n00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.370\nthey may not have any better understanding\nas well, so you wanna make sure that you\n\n77\n00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.790\nprovide everything that you can so\nthat they can be successful.\n\n78\n00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.350\nOur boss has that saying, that he says,\n\n79\n00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.600\nRonnie what is it that's gonna\nmake you perform your best?\n\n80\n00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.770\nAnd he tries to provide that for us.\n\n81\n00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.410\nHe says, my goal and\n\n82\n00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.950\nmy job is fairly simple, is that I remove\nany obstacles to your performance, Ronnie.\n\n83\n00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.640\nThat's what he says, so\nhe provides for us the equipment.\n\n84\n00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.530\nHe provides for us the training\nthat we need, whatever it is.\n\n85\n00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.650\nHe says, let's go ahead and do that so\nthat you can do your job, and\n\n86\n00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.910\nthat you really have no excuse to under\nperform, is what it comes down to.\n\n87\n00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.890\nAnd so\nthat's a great attitude to actually have.\n\n88\n00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.410\nAnd so\nwhen you have something like this, and\n\n89\n00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.470\nyou have the ability,\nthat's what you want to do, as well.\n\n90\n00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.110\nIf somebody is saying I just don't know,\nthen let's find out what we can do,\n\n91\n00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.320\nand training is usually\na big part of that too.\n\n92\n00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.620\nAlso, you may find out something.\n\n93\n00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.214\nTraining may just be to\nensure that team members,\n\n94\n00:05:11.214 --> 00:05:13.500\nwhat they are actually to be able to use.\n\n95\n00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.470\nNow what does that mean?\n\n96\n00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.920\nRemember that the ends\ndon't justify the means.\n\n97\n00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.120\nSo the idea of actually just\ncreating a project is not enough,\n\n98\n00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.660\nyou might find out that they have to go\nthrough some type of process training.\n\n99\n00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.500\nSo whatever the standard methodology\nis that they're to do here,\n\n100\n00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.380\neven though they might know another way\nto do it, you go, I can't accept that.\n\n101\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.750\nYou provide that standard\nmethodology of training so\n\n102\n00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.660\nthey know the proper way to do it,\nand that's what has to be done.\n\n103\n00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.560\nYou also do the same thing on tools.\n\n104\n00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.700\nYou don't let somebody drive an excavator\n\n105\n00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.975\nthat's only driven the Isuzu pick\nup truck to go and pick up parts.\n\n106\n00:05:48.975 --> 00:05:50.345\nNow can you, yeah, of course you can.\n\n107\n00:05:50.345 --> 00:05:53.976\nBut if they don't have the training for\nit, no you don't let them drive the big\n\n108\n00:05:53.976 --> 00:05:57.718\nexcavator around and you don't tell they\nto try and park it in the parking space,\n\n109\n00:05:57.718 --> 00:05:59.223\nor do parallel parking with it.\n\n110\n00:05:59.223 --> 00:06:00.129\nYou don't do that.\n\n111\n00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:00.972\n>> It would be fun.\n\n112\n00:06:00.972 --> 00:06:02.155\n>> [LAUGH] It would be fun.\n\n113\n00:06:02.155 --> 00:06:03.125\n>> [LAUGH] Not productive though.\n\n114\n00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:04.499\n>> Yeah, not very good.\n\n115\n00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:06.405\nBut that's what we're talking about,\nright.\n\n116\n00:06:06.405 --> 00:06:10.100\nMake sure that you do provide the training\nthat's necessary for them, for\n\n117\n00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.600\nwhatever skills that are there.\n\n118\n00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.250\nAnd even other templates\nthat you may have on hand\n\n119\n00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.530\nthat they need to be able to work with,\nthat they have to work with as well.\n\n120\n00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.800\nSo team training, being able to\nprovide all that is a good thing\n\n121\n00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.630\nthat does help build that cohesiveness\nthat we've been talking about, so\n\n122\n00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.870\nthat we actually understand.\n\n123\n00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.720\nNow hey, this is for the benefit and\n\n124\n00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.340\nbeing able to actually\naccomplish the entire project.\n\n125\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:38.620\nAnd all that is actually very good,\nas far as, as the idea of building a team.\n\n126\n00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.420\nSo when we talk about the idea here of\ncoordinating those human resources,\n\n127\n00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.200\nreally using that skill set\nof what we've talked about,\n\n128\n00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.320\nunderstanding the psychology behind it.\n\n129\n00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.230\nDoing team building, making sure we modify\nperformance doing the team training that\n\n130\n00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:57.340\nwe need, those are really big knockout\npunches that we can provide for our team\n\n131\n00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.680\nmembers to ensure that they can actually\nwork together the way that they need to.\n\n132\n00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.070\nSo, that's what we normally focus in on.\n\n133\n00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.810\nBut, there are times when you can't do it.\n\n134\n00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.040\n>> No, it's just not possible.\n\n135\n00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.670\nYou do the best you can with what\nyou have and that's all you can do.\n\n136\n00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.400\nNow we're talking about\nteam building here.\n\n137\n00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.100\nNow, what is one of the things that's\ngoing to our usually the thing\n\n138\n00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.580\nthat breaks down teams.\n\n139\n00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.000\nIt's conflict.\n\n140\n00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.260\nSo we have to figure out how\nwe can identify conflicts,\n\n141\n00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.740\nwhere they exist, and how to avoid them or\nmitigate them if at all possible.\n\n142\n00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.680\nAnd Ronnie, you've got some\nways in which we can do that.\n\n143\n00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.550\n>> We really do need to understand that.\n\n144\n00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.500\nA lot of times it's very easy as\na project manager to have blinders on,\n\n145\n00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.170\nin other words you have tunnel vision.\n\n146\n00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:40.520\nWhat you see is the end result,\nthe goal that's in mind.\n\n147\n00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.210\nAnd you now see your team working,\n\n148\n00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.740\nlet's say at less than the par performance\nthat you want them to work at.\n\n149\n00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.095\nAnd you don't start to ask them,\nwhy is it happening?\n\n150\n00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:53.718\nWhat you start seeing is just people that\nare not performing at the level that\n\n151\n00:07:53.718 --> 00:07:55.425\nthey're actually performing at.\n\n152\n00:07:55.425 --> 00:07:59.337\nAnd that means you're discounting\nsomething that happens inevitably among\n\n153\n00:07:59.337 --> 00:08:03.069\nhuman beings that work together in\na very tightly controlled structure or\n\n154\n00:08:03.069 --> 00:08:05.957\nin a very tight environment\nthat you're doing this in and\n\n155\n00:08:05.957 --> 00:08:08.460\nin a constrained environment as well.\n\n156\n00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.680\nYou really get no more constraints than\nyou do in a very timed project, right?\n\n157\n00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.960\nYou're constrained by the time and\n\n158\n00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.750\nthe very fact that everything\nthat you do has a deadline, okay?\n\n159\n00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.940\nYou're constrained by the very fact that\nthe amount of money that you have to spend\n\n160\n00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.300\nis not unlimited, it's actually\nwhat is actually designed and\n\n161\n00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.430\nwhat has actually been apportioned to\nyou that you're authorized to spend,\n\n162\n00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.645\nand any more than that you have\nto get more authorization,\n\n163\n00:08:29.645 --> 00:08:33.200\nnd also by what the expected result is,\nright?\n\n164\n00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.040\nThe overall quality of your work.\n\n165\n00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.610\nIt can be judged at any particular point\nin time once everything's set in place,\n\n166\n00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.790\nwhether they say this is good work or\nwhether it's bad work.\n\n167\n00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:45.440\nSo when you start putting people\ntogether in that environment,\n\n168\n00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.480\nblame can actually happen very easily\nwhen things don't work out, and\n\n169\n00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.720\nwhat that actually resolves in\nis some kind of conflict, right?\n\n170\n00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:58.438\nAnd so what we need to do is, as project\nmanagers, is to open up our eyes a little\n\n171\n00:08:58.438 --> 00:09:04.002\nbit more, and to actually see what is\nthe root cause of the conflict, okay?\n\n172\n00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:05.725\nNow it's very easy for\n\n173\n00:09:05.725 --> 00:09:10.720\nus as human beings to always try\nto pinpoint it to a person, okay?\n\n174\n00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.921\nAnd hate to say, a lot of times it may\nabsolutely be one person or just a small\n\n175\n00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:19.060\ngroup of people that really aren't\nperforming the way that they are, and\n\n176\n00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:24.100\nwe need to treat them in a special way,\nand we'll talk about that in a little bit.\n\n177\n00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.680\nBut, we need to consider\nsome elements here, okay?\n\n178\n00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.430\nAs just a project manager, what could\nbe causing the actual conflicts?\n\n179\n00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:35.365\nSo let's take a look at several things\nthat it might actually end up being here,\n\n180\n00:09:35.365 --> 00:09:35.920\nokay?\n\n181\n00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.930\nSo one of the things that we\nhave to actually realize,\n\n182\n00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:43.320\nespecially if we are now part of a team or\na project team.\n\n183\n00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.330\nBut let's say that we are in\nthat functional matrix, right?\n\n184\n00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.520\nIf we go back to our initial stage here or\n\n185\n00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:55.180\nthe pre-project setup, we talked about\nsome of the organizations that we're in.\n\n186\n00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:00.168\nAnd in a functional organization you might\nfind out that you as a project manager,\n\n187\n00:10:00.168 --> 00:10:03.350\nyou get to deal with these\nfunctional managers, but\n\n188\n00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.547\nthey really have all\nthe authority on your project.\n\n189\n00:10:06.547 --> 00:10:10.983\nAnd so what might end up happening here is\nthat you go to that manager and you say, I\n\n190\n00:10:10.983 --> 00:10:15.291\nneed a couple of resources, and they tell\nyou well you can use this resource but\n\n191\n00:10:15.291 --> 00:10:17.460\nonly, let's say, part time, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.513\nSo you might find something like\nthat actually working here,\n\n193\n00:10:20.513 --> 00:10:24.621\nwhere essentially what happens is that\none individual, that human resource now,\n\n194\n00:10:24.621 --> 00:10:28.630\nIs that he's working for that functional\nmanager, he's also working for you.\n\n195\n00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.890\nAnd so now, his time and\n\n196\n00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.993\nhis interest are actually divided\nbecause he's still getting demands and\n\n197\n00:10:34.993 --> 00:10:39.770\nwork from the functional manager,\nhe's getting demands and work from you.\n\n198\n00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:44.570\nWell, where does he put both,\nif both things have to be accomplished?\n\n199\n00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.140\nWell, if you don't think that\nthis can cause conflicts,\n\n200\n00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.850\nright, when you're expecting\nsomething to be done and\n\n201\n00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:53.550\nanother manager's expecting something\nto be done, and you're one person.\n\n202\n00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:56.140\nYou have really blinded\nyourself to something\n\n203\n00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.120\nthat you've gotta open your eyes to.\n\n204\n00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.940\nDaniel, that doesn't happen\nat all at times, does it?\n\n205\n00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:05.870\n>> No, never, never, no,\nyou never have a situation to where one\n\n206\n00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:09.610\nperson is being pulled in two different\ndirections, and you're trying to please\n\n207\n00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.170\nboth of the people that are trying\nto get to do something for them.\n\n208\n00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:17.970\nAnd it does It tends to cause a lot of\nconflict between the two people trying use\n\n209\n00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:22.450\nthe same resource, and as well for the\nperson there's consternation at the very\n\n210\n00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.680\nleast, for the person that's\nbeing pulled in both directions.\n\n211\n00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.030\nSo it's really good to open up\nthose lines of communications.\n\n212\n00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:34.750\nIf Ronnie comes to me and says I need\nyou to work on a show for next week.\n\n213\n00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:40.130\nI go, well I am working on two shows for\nnext week already for Mike and Wess.\n\n214\n00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.610\nNow he's gonna say, well I need\nyou to have that show done, but\n\n215\n00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:48.290\nhe understands that I'm probably not going\nto have as much time to spend on his.\n\n216\n00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:49.420\nIf I don't let him know that,\n\n217\n00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.600\nif I don't communicate that with him,\nhe's just gonna get angry with me, and\n\n218\n00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.470\nthen he's gonna get angry at Wess and Mike\nbecause I'm spending time on their stuff.\n\n219\n00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:00.202\nSo you have to keep that communication\nopen to try to alleviate that, but\n\n220\n00:12:00.202 --> 00:12:03.320\nit is a very, very common, or\njust resources in general.\n\n221\n00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.110\nI want the shovel.\n\n222\n00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.460\nNo, I want the shovel.\n\n223\n00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.930\nI've literally seen two\ngrown men fight over a rope.\n\n224\n00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:11.230\nThat is not a joke.\n\n225\n00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.230\nBecause they both needed the rope for\nsomething.\n\n226\n00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:13.820\nOne grabbed it and\n\n227\n00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.290\npulled it and it looked like two kids on\na playground fighting over a jump rope.\n\n228\n00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.100\nIt was hilarious and\nsad all at the same time.\n\n229\n00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.900\nWe're gonna show you some ways in\nwhich we can get around conflict,\n\n230\n00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.830\nbut that is definitely\nsomething that you will see.\n\n231\n00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:31.610\n>> And so when you think about\njust a situation like that, right?\n\n232\n00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:32.680\nConflicts can arise.\n\n233\n00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.880\nAnd as a project manager if\nyou're not realizing that, okay,\n\n234\n00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.460\nthen you're gonna miss the boat on that.\n\n235\n00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.010\nAnd you're gonna actually think that it\nhas something to do with that particular\n\n236\n00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:43.030\nperson's ability to actually\ndo the performance that\n\n237\n00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.480\nyou've actually required of them,\nwhen it could be just a divided loyalty.\n\n238\n00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.130\nAnd he has to actually say\nI can't do them both or\n\n239\n00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.040\nhe has to actually tell\nyou what's happening.\n\n240\n00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.540\nBut if you're not willing to listen and\n\n241\n00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.280\nthe other person's not willing to listen,\nit still has to be accomplished.\n\n242\n00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.970\nIt's just gonna be delayed\nmore than you realize.\n\n243\n00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.100\nAnd that's gonna cause conflict\nbetween you and that resource as well.\n\n244\n00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:00.830\nSo just be aware.\n\n245\n00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:04.380\nThe other one that can happen\nis the idea here of what we call\n\n246\n00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.090\ndiffering expert opinions.\n\n247\n00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:10.510\nNow Daniel, that doesn't ever happen\nat all, even among us as we sit in our\n\n248\n00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:14.060\ncubicles where we are where,\nwe have differing opinions.\n\n249\n00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.900\nBut all of us do this, right,\nall of us can actually bring in\n\n250\n00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.490\nexperts that we believe that is\ngonna support our side, okay, and\n\n251\n00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.760\nof course,\nnobody is gonna be willing to back down.\n\n252\n00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.240\nNone, none,\nall of us will stick to our guns, and\n\n253\n00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.630\nwe will die on that little micro hill\nthat we've actually created there.\n\n254\n00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.030\nAnd when you think about it, right,\n\n255\n00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:35.770\nespecially when you're trying to do\nsomething under time constraints,\n\n256\n00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.340\ncost constraints, performance constraints,\nor resources here.\n\n257\n00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.280\nMan that is actually one of\nthe worst things in the world when\n\n258\n00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.820\nabsolutely some body is wrong and\nthey're saying what?\n\n259\n00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.940\nI am not wrong on this.\n\n260\n00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.468\nI am not gonna do this.\n\n261\n00:13:48.468 --> 00:13:51.680\nAnd now somebody else is saying,\nof course you're wrong on it, and\n\n262\n00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.790\nthey're still demanding I'm not wrong.\n\n263\n00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:54.850\nYou're gonna have conflicts, and\n\n264\n00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.340\nthat is now a little bit more\nof an interpersonal conflict.\n\n265\n00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.260\n>> Yeah, best advice I ever got\nwas never argue an opinion, right,\n\n266\n00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.970\nbecause you cannot win that fight.\n\n267\n00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:04.370\nOpinions are subjective.\n\n268\n00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:08.490\nNow we do have two experts, and they\nmight differ in their opinions on the way\n\n269\n00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:12.360\nsomething should be done\nin their methodologies.\n\n270\n00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.970\nNow it's up to you as\nthe individual to say, well,\n\n271\n00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:19.980\nI think this is going to be the correct\nway to go, or I think theirs is better.\n\n272\n00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.920\nYou cannot argue whether or\nnot one is right and\n\n273\n00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.820\none is wrong because they're\nboth based off of an opinion.\n\n274\n00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.801\nThis usually comes about during\nthe experiences to those people.\n\n275\n00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:32.513\nThey are experts in their field, it just\nshows you that there's more than one way\n\n276\n00:14:32.513 --> 00:14:36.171\nto skin a cat, and you just gotta figure\nout which one is the best way for you, and\n\n277\n00:14:36.171 --> 00:14:39.580\ngo with that, and that's gonna be\nwhat helps resolute those conflicts.\n\n278\n00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:44.260\nBut we all do it all the time, Ronnie and\nI, we've had knock down drag outs.\n\n279\n00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.310\nBut we're still here working together,\ngetting it done,\n\n280\n00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:48.800\nbecause we set those things aside,\nand realized,\n\n281\n00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.290\nhey that's Ronnie opinion on that,\nthat's my opinion on it.\n\n282\n00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.880\nWhen it comes to fact,\nfacts are facts you can't argue those.\n\n283\n00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.871\nIt's either true or\n\n284\n00:14:54.871 --> 00:14:58.150\nit's not, but opinions,\nthat's a fools errand to argue those.\n\n285\n00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.578\n>> And still, we do those.\n\n286\n00:15:00.578 --> 00:15:01.878\n>> We can't help ourselves.\n\n287\n00:15:01.878 --> 00:15:05.738\n>> We can't help ourselves, and\nthat can lead to more conflict, right?\n\n288\n00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:09.807\nAnd if you're project manager, and you're\nnot willing to address the very fact that\n\n289\n00:15:09.807 --> 00:15:13.651\npeople will stand on their opinion, and\nthey will die by their opinion at times,\n\n290\n00:15:13.651 --> 00:15:16.363\nand you've gotta figure it\nout ways to work around that,\n\n291\n00:15:16.363 --> 00:15:18.430\nthen you're overlooking a very big part.\n\n292\n00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.830\nEven though you might think,\nit's just Ronnie's personality.\n\n293\n00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:25.240\nHe's just being this way, but overall\nthough, you gotta realize that somebody's\n\n294\n00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.270\nexpert judgement here, they believe\nthat they're right, and they may not be.\n\n295\n00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.897\nSo being able to show them to that, and\nwhat we'll talk about, like I said,\n\n296\n00:15:31.897 --> 00:15:34.754\nthere's some different conflict resolution\nmethods that we need to go through.\n\n297\n00:15:34.754 --> 00:15:38.960\nThe last one that I wanna talk about\nhere is a bit superficial, okay?\n\n298\n00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:44.395\nBut it absolutely will wear you down,\nokay, and I mean this, okay?\n\n299\n00:15:44.395 --> 00:15:50.063\nWhen I talked about varying work stocks,\nokay, this can drive us all nuts.\n\n300\n00:15:50.063 --> 00:15:53.599\nIf you learned how to do\nsomething a certain way, Okay, and\n\n301\n00:15:53.599 --> 00:15:57.304\nyou absolutely believe this is\nthe right way to do something.\n\n302\n00:15:57.304 --> 00:16:00.596\nWhatever that process is,\nsomebody else comes along and\n\n303\n00:16:00.596 --> 00:16:03.150\nthey do it a different way.\n\n304\n00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.305\nAnd you better believe it,\nthey do it a different way,\n\n305\n00:16:06.305 --> 00:16:08.784\nit's gonna drive you completely insane.\n\n306\n00:16:08.784 --> 00:16:11.920\nAnd this can happen, especially in\nvarying work styles, in this way.\n\n307\n00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.340\nIf you're an early bird,\nthat's perfectly fine,\n\n308\n00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.880\nbut then when the guy that comes in like,\nyeah, I get to work, and\n\n309\n00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:23.450\nhe's right there at 8:59 [LAUGH] and\nhe walks in.\n\n310\n00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:28.080\nAnd it drives you nuts at times where\nyou're the person that's early.\n\n311\n00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:33.193\nI like to call it the Oscar versus Felix\nin the Odd Couple show that's there,\n\n312\n00:16:33.193 --> 00:16:35.010\nthey were able to live together.\n\n313\n00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:39.460\nI don't know how they were able to live\ntogether, but they were able to do so, but\n\n314\n00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.480\nthis kind of stuff can cause conflicts.\n\n315\n00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.635\nAnd you as a project manager goes,\n[SOUND], that's superficial,\n\n316\n00:16:45.635 --> 00:16:46.658\nput that behind you.\n\n317\n00:16:46.658 --> 00:16:49.917\nBut if it sticks in your crawl,\nit sticks there, right?\n\n318\n00:16:49.917 --> 00:16:54.269\nIf it absolutely just drives you nuts this\nis something that a project manager's\n\n319\n00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:55.613\ngotta realize and then,\n\n320\n00:16:55.613 --> 00:16:59.460\nwell figure out what is the resolution\nto this if it's at all possible.\n\n321\n00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.510\nA lot of times it may not be, but\n\n322\n00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:05.330\nyou need to at least understand\nthat there are other influences\n\n323\n00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:10.020\nbesides just somebody's personality\nthat is causing this, okay?\n\n324\n00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.560\nSo don't always stick it to that.\n\n325\n00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.970\nRemember that people are in\nsituations that they are in,\n\n326\n00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.060\nokay, regardless of whether or\nnot you like them as a project manager.\n\n327\n00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.850\nRemember that people will\nstick by their decisions.\n\n328\n00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:24.020\nRemember that also work styles as you\ntry to actually merge them together,\n\n329\n00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.860\nthey may not work well together,\nno matter what.\n\n330\n00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:29.450\nIt's not actually\na condemnation of either one,\n\n331\n00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:31.250\nwe're not saying one's right or\none's wrong.\n\n332\n00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:35.540\nBut we may find out that the idea here of\ntrying to get those two to work together\n\n333\n00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.180\nis not gonna get us any productivity,\nthey're not gonna be effective.\n\n334\n00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.890\n>> That's it, now that we have\ndecided that, well there is conflict,\n\n335\n00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.330\nit does happen and it is a true thing.\n\n336\n00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:48.670\nNow what we have to do is detect that\nconflict and see where it's happening and\n\n337\n00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.000\nwhat we can do to resolve that.\n\n338\n00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.480\nCuz ultimately if we\ncan resolve a conflict,\n\n339\n00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.395\nwhen we get past it, what's gonna happen?\n\n340\n00:17:54.395 --> 00:17:57.940\nProductivity's gonna go up, and\nthe project is gonna be completed on time,\n\n341\n00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.430\nunder budget, and everything that's,\nthe heavens will open up and\n\n342\n00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:01.500\nangels will descend.\n\n343\n00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.565\nIt'll be a wonderful thing.\n\n344\n00:18:02.565 --> 00:18:05.980\nRonnie, you've got some great techniques\nfor helping resolve conflicts.\n\n345\n00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.740\n>> Yeah, there's really about six\ndifferent methods that you're gonna\n\n346\n00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.100\nbe able to try as a project\nmanager to resolve this.\n\n347\n00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.160\nNow, does this mean it's exhaustive?\n\n348\n00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:18.060\nNo, okay, so don't forget, you can\nprobably get a PhD in conflict resolution.\n\n349\n00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.160\nAnd so if you wanna go for\nthat perfectly, great.\n\n350\n00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.090\nHere we're just talking about some of the\nthings you may try as a project manager to\n\n351\n00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:26.140\nresolve different conflicts\nthat you have in front of you.\n\n352\n00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:29.840\nThe worst part is you have to balance\nthat out on that person's temperament and\n\n353\n00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.800\njudgement.\n\n354\n00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.572\nAnd of course the situation\nthat they're in and\n\n355\n00:18:32.572 --> 00:18:35.190\nmaking sure that everything's\nactually gonna happen.\n\n356\n00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.330\nLet's go on and take a look at\nthe first few of these conflict\n\n357\n00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:39.820\nresolution techniques.\n\n358\n00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.090\nThe first one is what we\ncall smoothing here, okay?\n\n359\n00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:46.450\nSo when we take a look at\nthe idea of smoothing,\n\n360\n00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:48.640\nthis is something that we might try and\n\n361\n00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.250\ndo just because we don't have really\nany other better way to do it, okay?\n\n362\n00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:56.610\nThe emphasis here on is to emphasize\nwhat areas we agree on and\n\n363\n00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:01.010\nessentially, it says minimize, but\nignore the areas we disagree on.\n\n364\n00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.253\nIn other words, Daniel and I,\nwe come together and we'll say,\n\n365\n00:19:03.253 --> 00:19:07.907\nlook, we'll work on this, but don't talk\nto me after work, don't do it, okay?\n\n366\n00:19:07.907 --> 00:19:11.520\nI hope Daniel never says that, but\nlet's say something like that, okay?\n\n367\n00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.650\nAnd it sounds like a great idea, right?\n\n368\n00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:16.470\nIf they can just agree to\nwork together on this,\n\n369\n00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:18.970\nI don't care what happens afterwards,\nokay?\n\n370\n00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:21.560\nBut the problem is if there's\na real conflict there,\n\n371\n00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:27.000\nokay, it doesn't actually do anything for\nboth sides, okay?\n\n372\n00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.960\nYou're not actually resolving conflict,\nboth sides end up losing.\n\n373\n00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.918\nDaniel still has to work with me,\nwhich he's not pleased with.\n\n374\n00:19:32.918 --> 00:19:36.110\nMe, I might go, well heck,\nI can't talk to him after work.\n\n375\n00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:38.410\nSo we both can end up losing there.\n\n376\n00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:42.480\nSo the idea of the conflict, right,\nis that it never gets resolved, why?\n\n377\n00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.300\nBecause we're simply avoiding\nwhatever it is that we have\n\n378\n00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.960\nthe disagreement about, okay?\n\n379\n00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.220\nBut it is the process of smoothing, and\n\n380\n00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:53.870\nlot of times, is at least as\na functional workout, right?\n\n381\n00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:59.320\nIt's a temporary Band-Aid of a solution\nin terms of conflict resolution.\n\n382\n00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.920\n>> It's a very pragmatic approach,\nwell, it's working, right?\n\n383\n00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.850\nThey're getting stuff done.\n\n384\n00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.503\nThe only problem with is that\nthe kettle is still boiling,\n\n385\n00:20:06.503 --> 00:20:11.600\n[LAUGH] it's still sitting on the fire,\nand the potential for another problem,\n\n386\n00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.090\na bigger problem later down\nthe road is still there.\n\n387\n00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:14.690\nDoes it work?\n\n388\n00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.270\nIs it a type of\nconflict-resolution technique?\n\n389\n00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:18.910\nYes it is, it can work.\n\n390\n00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:21.160\nAnd if the project is short enough\nmaybe that's your solution,\n\n391\n00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.458\nthat's what you gotta go with.\n\n392\n00:20:22.458 --> 00:20:25.250\nBut in long-term projects\nallowing conflict\n\n393\n00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.180\nunderneath the surface to continue to\nfester is probably not your best solution.\n\n394\n00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.750\nSo we have some other techniques.\n\n395\n00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:33.430\n>> We do, the other one of course,\nis to go to the opposite extreme.\n\n396\n00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:36.600\nIs I just tell you what\nthe resolution is gonna be, okay?\n\n397\n00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:42.750\nThat's it, I'm the project manager,\nwhatever your resolution is,\n\n398\n00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.020\nit's not gonna work, whatever your\nresolution is, it's not gonna work.\n\n399\n00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.860\nMy resolution is gonna work for you.\n\n400\n00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:46.604\n>> Now kiss and make up.\n\n401\n00:20:46.604 --> 00:20:47.180\n>> And that's it.\n[LAUGH]\n\n402\n00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:48.306\n>> Now kiss and make up.\n\n403\n00:20:48.306 --> 00:20:49.820\n>> Now, so what am I doing?\n\n404\n00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.270\nI'm telling you,\nhere's what the resolution is gonna be.\n\n405\n00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:55.430\nIt's gonna force everybody\nthat's actually a part of this,\n\n406\n00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:59.190\nright, the other parties here,\ninto a solution, and\n\n407\n00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:02.260\nthey're not necessarily gonna agree with\nthe solution that's actually on hand.\n\n408\n00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.250\n>> And this is called forcing?\n\n409\n00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:06.774\n>> It's called forcing, it literally\nis called forcing, it's me telling you,\n\n410\n00:21:06.774 --> 00:21:08.835\nthis is how we're gonna resolve this,\nokay?\n\n411\n00:21:08.835 --> 00:21:12.945\nAnd both sides could absolutely disagree\nthat that's gonna solve anything, but\n\n412\n00:21:12.945 --> 00:21:16.158\nI'm saying for the peace of the project,\nI'm gonna go ahead and\n\n413\n00:21:16.158 --> 00:21:18.050\nsolve it in this way, okay?\n\n414\n00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:22.640\nNow when you do this,\nyou can just pick one side.\n\n415\n00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.010\nAnd you're essentially deciding who's\ngonna win and who's gonna lose, okay?\n\n416\n00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:29.400\nCuz you're the only one that's\npicking the winner at this point, and\n\n417\n00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.170\nyou might do it just because you go,\nI don't know what else to do, so\n\n418\n00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:35.800\nI'm just going to say, Daniel is\ngoing to be winning this argument.\n\n419\n00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.660\nAnd you go, wait a minute,\nthere's no basis or merit for that, and\n\n420\n00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.718\nI say, I don't care.\n\n421\n00:21:39.718 --> 00:21:43.310\nI said who's winning this argument,\nthat's the way it's gonna be.\n\n422\n00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:45.064\n>> Welcome to the mayor of Arbitraryville.\n\n423\n00:21:45.064 --> 00:21:48.199\n>> [LAUGH] That's right, so a lot of times\nwhen you start seeing something like this,\n\n424\n00:21:48.199 --> 00:21:51.300\nlet me see, I didn't realize\nI had zoomed out that much.\n\n425\n00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:55.800\nWhen you start seeing this, right,\nit's never a great situation, right?\n\n426\n00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.030\nBecause once you pick the winner,\n\n427\n00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:01.550\nthe problem that you have now is anybody\nwilling to actually bring up a conflict\n\n428\n00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.600\nagain because they're saying you're\njust gonna be arbitrary about it.\n\n429\n00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.330\nSo the conflict's gonna continue to\nboil underneath the surface here.\n\n430\n00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:12.000\nAnd what normally ends up happening is\nwhen a lot of this stuff is forced,\n\n431\n00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.390\nyou get extreme resolutions at this\npoint which are never good for anybody.\n\n432\n00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:17.730\nSomebody either leaves, or\n\n433\n00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:22.040\nsomebody ends up leaving without\nteeth is what can end up happening.\n\n434\n00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.018\nSo you think I'm joking.\n\n435\n00:22:24.018 --> 00:22:27.050\n>> I've seen it.\n>> Yeah, so at times, if you tell me that,\n\n436\n00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:31.620\nhey, this is what I have to accept, I may\nsay no and punch you right in the nose.\n\n437\n00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.760\nThere's no way that I'm accepting this,\ncuz it's not right.\n\n438\n00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.320\nAnd you can, so just kinda realize,\n\n439\n00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:42.150\nforcing can it be done in an emergency\nsituation, you may do it.\n\n440\n00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:45.620\nBut then if you do it you've\ngotta now actually go back and\n\n441\n00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.680\noffer some type of real\nresolution in the end here.\n\n442\n00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.110\nAnd saying just do it for now,\nlet's get through this and\n\n443\n00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:53.600\nthen we'll deal with it afterwards.\n\n444\n00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.431\nBut the key is if you say that, right,\nmake sure you deal with it afterward,\n\n445\n00:22:56.431 --> 00:22:58.433\ndon't leave it,\ndon't leave it festering, okay?\n\n446\n00:22:58.433 --> 00:23:01.746\nThe other one, of course,\nis the biggest one that most people end up\n\n447\n00:23:01.746 --> 00:23:05.820\ndoing even though they don't like it here,\nis compromise, right?\n\n448\n00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:10.500\nEssentially, this is another type\nof nobody really winning, right?\n\n449\n00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.440\nEverybody gives up,\n\n450\n00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:16.210\nboth sides give up something to\njust reach some type of resolution.\n\n451\n00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.955\nParties that are committed to\nthe resolution, which is why it works, and\n\n452\n00:23:19.955 --> 00:23:24.830\nas they're saying okay, even though I\nwon't get my way, you're not gonna get\n\n453\n00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:28.620\nyour way, but it helps us to resolve\nsomething so that we can get through.\n\n454\n00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:32.507\nNo real winners, no real losers at\nthis point, but nobody feels satisfied\n\n455\n00:23:32.507 --> 00:23:35.853\nabout this, and nothing is really\ndone about the issue, okay?\n\n456\n00:23:35.853 --> 00:23:37.157\nThe only thing you’ve done is saying,\n\n457\n00:23:37.157 --> 00:23:39.660\nI’m willing to give up this point if\nyou’re willing to give up this point.\n\n458\n00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.684\nHow does that resolve anything, okay?\n\n459\n00:23:42.684 --> 00:23:45.341\nIt just gives us less to argue about, but\n\n460\n00:23:45.341 --> 00:23:49.573\nat the same time it doesn't take\naway the issue and the problem.\n\n461\n00:23:49.573 --> 00:23:52.805\nAnd the other thing about the idea of\nthe compromise is my last sentence.\n\n462\n00:23:52.805 --> 00:23:56.056\nConflict I put may happen again.\n\n463\n00:23:56.056 --> 00:24:01.220\nI'm gonna say conflict will happen again,\nif you do compromise.\n\n464\n00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.300\nIt's not a permanent solution.\n\n465\n00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.970\n>> This is why I tend to\noveremphasize my point for\n\n466\n00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:05.440\nwhen these types of things happen.\n\n467\n00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.600\nSo then a compromise, as I have to reduce\nwhat it is that I want to give up,\n\n468\n00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.795\nI actually get what I want.\n\n469\n00:24:11.795 --> 00:24:13.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's\n\n470\n00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:14.210\na personal thing that I've learned.\n\n471\n00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:15.800\nYou can take that or leave it as it may.\n\n472\n00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.460\nBut compromise, it's the idea of saying,\nyou get a little bit of what you want,\n\n473\n00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.810\nI get a little bit of what I want, and\n\n474\n00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:24.860\nhopefully that's enough\nto satisfy the conflict.\n\n475\n00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:29.430\nNeither of us came out winners, but\nneither of us came out loser either.\n\n476\n00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:32.440\nSo let's resolve and lay it there and\n\n477\n00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.190\nnow let's move on and\ncontinue with the project.\n\n478\n00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:39.720\nBecause if you don't, a lot of animosity\ncan happen when you say, Ronnie is\n\n479\n00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.750\nthe declared winner and I've done forcing\ntechniques to make Ronnie that winner and\n\n480\n00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:49.050\nnow everybody else hates me because I\njust, yeah, it's a blatant manipulation.\n\n481\n00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:51.590\nIf we do the opposite\nextreme of that where I say,\n\n482\n00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.060\nlet's just not talk about this.\n\n483\n00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:56.590\nLet's just all hold hands and\nsing kumbaya and forget about it,\n\n484\n00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:58.090\nlet's get the work done.\n\n485\n00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:01.520\nThen again, we've got that\nfestering boil happening and\n\n486\n00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.720\neventually Mount Vesuvius is going to\nerupt, and there's going to be a conflict.\n\n487\n00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.250\nI see compromise as being one of the\nbetter options here, just because at least\n\n488\n00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:12.690\nsometimes people fell like even\nthough they didn't win completely,\n\n489\n00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:13.850\nat least they got something.\n\n490\n00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:15.940\nThere was some level of validation and\n\n491\n00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:21.160\nit can at least abate the conflict enough\nto allow productivity to continue.\n\n492\n00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.870\n>> Yeah there's no doubt that you might\nsee that more often because it does.\n\n493\n00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:27.910\nIt allows both sides to feel like,\nhey we didn't completely lose,\n\n494\n00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:29.360\nbut we didn't win either.\n\n495\n00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.950\nSo as long as the other guy didn't win,\nI'm okay with it.\n\n496\n00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:32.510\nOkay?\n\n497\n00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.940\nNow, there's three more that we\nwanna focus in on here, too.\n\n498\n00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.380\nAnd we'll take a look at\nthem briefly as well, okay?\n\n499\n00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.460\nNow, I'm gonna do this a little bit out\nof order because the Win-Win Resolution,\n\n500\n00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.980\nthat's confronting, and\nthat's the one we spend more time on.\n\n501\n00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.670\nThe other one, of course, is one that\nwe're probably familiar with more often\n\n502\n00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:49.680\nthan we realize, which is just\noutright avoidance of the conflict.\n\n503\n00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.390\nOne party essentially says,\nI'm not ever gonna argue about it.\n\n504\n00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:54.680\nI'm not even going to discuss this.\n\n505\n00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:59.870\nSo, even if you have some\nparticular conflict that's real,\n\n506\n00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.520\none party just refuses to be\nany part of the solution, nor\n\n507\n00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.980\nrefuses to have any other action with it.\n\n508\n00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.950\nSo there's never going to be\na resolution reached at this point, and\n\n509\n00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:09.190\nthat means there's a loser right?\n\n510\n00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:10.490\nThere's always a loser.\n\n511\n00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.190\nThe person that really has an issue, he's\ngoing to loose because nobody's actually\n\n512\n00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:15.780\ngoing to say that this\nneeds to be resolved.\n\n513\n00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.400\nThe other guy's saying,\nthere's no resolution so\n\n514\n00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.510\nI'm not even gonna participate in this.\n\n515\n00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:25.170\nBoth sides end up losing as\na result in terms of avoidance.\n\n516\n00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:27.470\nAnd the issue never gets solved as well.\n\n517\n00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:30.740\nThere is a possibility of negotiation,\nokay?\n\n518\n00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:35.130\nSo when you do a negotiation though, this\nis a little bit more arbitrary, right?\n\n519\n00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:38.490\nWhere you bring in somebody\nto actually hear the case.\n\n520\n00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:39.470\nHear this.\n\n521\n00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:41.520\nBut remember that if you're\ndoing a negotiation,\n\n522\n00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:47.550\nyou've got to realize that negotiator\nis not actually acting on your behalf,\n\n523\n00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:51.140\nnot acting on their behalf,\nthey are essentially babysitters.\n\n524\n00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.730\nJust like the Solomon-\n>> Yeah he has no interest in the fight.\n\n525\n00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:56.660\nThat's the whole purpose\nof having the third party.\n\n526\n00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.710\nHe's not Ronnie's best buddy,\nhe's not my best buddy.\n\n527\n00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:01.420\nHey we probably don't\neven know the person.\n\n528\n00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:05.050\nThey come in and they hear the arguments\nand they decide who's case is more valid,\n\n529\n00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:07.750\nwhat's gonna be more productive and\nthen they come down with a ruling.\n\n530\n00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:10.730\nAnd at least it's based on\nsome sort of logical form and\n\n531\n00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:14.690\nwe know that it's not just, even though\nit's an arbitration, it's not arbitrary.\n\n532\n00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:16.360\nThey didn't just say, well I'm yeah,\n\n533\n00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.040\nI just like Ronnie's beard so\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n534\n00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.960\n>> that's why I'm going with Ronnie's,\n\n535\n00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.100\nsubject.\n\n536\n00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.140\nNo here is your argument,\nhere is my argument.\n\n537\n00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.960\nHe weighed and measured them and figured\none had more weight than the other.\n\n538\n00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:31.780\n>> Yeah and the negotiation of the other\nthing tends to pop out just by accident\n\n539\n00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.400\nas far as a solution goes.\n\n540\n00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.690\nSo what can happen is Daniel can present\nhis case and I can present my case,\n\n541\n00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:42.220\nbut then in the meantime I went ahead and\n\n542\n00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:45.990\ntalked to 10 or\n15 people who will agree with me.\n\n543\n00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:49.970\nAnd so I bring them into the negotiation\nessentially adding in what we call\n\n544\n00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:53.570\ncollective bargaining, saying hey,\nhere's who I represent.\n\n545\n00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:55.660\nI'm not just representing\nme Daniel anymore.\n\n546\n00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.140\nI'm representing these guys behind me, and\n\n547\n00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:00.140\nnow you can see why it can\nbe influenced in that way.\n\n548\n00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.240\nSo negotiation can work.\n\n549\n00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.110\nBut as they do this type of thing\nyou can also see where it can be\n\n550\n00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.330\nmanipulated as well.\n\n551\n00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.880\nSo, never really,\n\n552\n00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:12.820\neven though it will give you some ability\nto work through it, you might find\n\n553\n00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:17.040\nyourself snowballed a little bit of\nthinking it's just between me and you.\n\n554\n00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:17.570\n>> That's right.\n\n555\n00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.922\nAnd then you can just engage\nin character assassination.\n\n556\n00:28:19.922 --> 00:28:20.558\n[LAUGH].\n\n557\n00:28:20.558 --> 00:28:22.207\n>> Yeah.\n>> And you can see how these\n\n558\n00:28:22.207 --> 00:28:24.860\nthings start to digress pretty quickly.\n\n559\n00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:27.640\nBut if they're done right and\nthey're taking, you got the checks and\n\n560\n00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:31.630\nbalances in place, it should at least\nalleviate a lot of the conflicts.\n\n561\n00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:37.310\nMost people aren't willing to die\ncompletely for some project problem.\n\n562\n00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:40.710\nThey're willing to say all right,\nyou know what, let's just get beyond this.\n\n563\n00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:41.580\nWe've got an arbitrator.\n\n564\n00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:46.930\nHe's ruled I guess that is what it is,\nlet's move on, so it can be very helpful.\n\n565\n00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:47.740\n>> It really can.\n\n566\n00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:52.370\nSo let's spend our little bit of remaining\ntime together on just a couple of things.\n\n567\n00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:55.850\nOne, there is really only one\nresolution method that works here,\n\n568\n00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:58.300\nokay, which is confrontation.\n\n569\n00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:03.320\nNow, this is not the idea of you\nmeeting in a gladiator arena-\n\n570\n00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.100\n>> Michael Buffer.\n\n571\n00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.120\n>> And beating each other.\n\n572\n00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.280\nYeah, Michael Buffer.\n\n573\n00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:11.650\nYou can but just kinda remember\nthat here the key is what?\n\n574\n00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:15.170\nIs that we're trying to actually\nsolve the problem at this point.\n\n575\n00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:18.430\nAnd it is, it is by far the best\nway to resolve the problem.\n\n576\n00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:19.930\nNow will people get heated?\n\n577\n00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:23.410\nAt times, yes, but what you do is you\nbase this around some fact finding.\n\n578\n00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:27.540\nIn other words, it's not based on\nwhat I feel or what he did to me.\n\n579\n00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:31.760\nYou take a look at the facts that are\nactually presented here, okay, and then\n\n580\n00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:35.400\nyou make sure that both sides understand\nthe facts that you've actually seen.\n\n581\n00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.210\nAnd that whatever decision is\nmade through this confrontation,\n\n582\n00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:41.920\nthat this is to be a clear resolution, and\n\n583\n00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:47.250\nboth sides are to agree that here's what\nwill resolve the problem itself, okay.\n\n584\n00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:51.100\nSo being able to come through that\nconfrontation is gonna be key.\n\n585\n00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.932\nNow, when you do that, right,\nit can be a long process.\n\n586\n00:29:53.932 --> 00:29:57.420\nAnd so you're not going to be able\nto solve this over night sometimes.\n\n587\n00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.000\nCan it?\nYes.\n\n588\n00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.480\nOkay.\nCan it be resolved over a fit fight?\n\n589\n00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.680\nYes it could if you want to, but just\nrealize that what you want is that both\n\n590\n00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.340\nsides agree that this is the only\nway to really solve this.\n\n591\n00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.510\nLet's get all the facts in front of both\nsides, make sure they agree to the facts,\n\n592\n00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:16.820\nand if they agree to the facts of\nwhatever it is they're presenting,\n\n593\n00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:19.220\nthen there is no conflict anymore, okay?\n\n594\n00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.500\nAnd then you can say,\nwell what about this?\n\n595\n00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.900\nAnd I'll say, that's personal, okay?\n\n596\n00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:26.320\nThat's not having anything to do with\nwhat the conflict is about right now, but\n\n597\n00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.820\nmake sure that they both know what\nthey're actually fighting for,\n\n598\n00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:30.780\nmake sure they agree on the facts here.\n\n599\n00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.040\nAnd once you do,\nyou've actually resolved that conflict.\n\n600\n00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:37.670\nSo, that takes a little bit more\noff of you to try and go you know,\n\n601\n00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:40.040\nI've known this guy longer,\nI've known this guy longer.\n\n602\n00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.870\nYou actually are basing your\nparticular resolution on\n\n603\n00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:45.150\nwhat's actually been\npresented there as facts.\n\n604\n00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:47.020\nBut you do have to take\nthe time to do fact-finding.\n\n605\n00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:47.850\n>> That's right.\n\n606\n00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:51.740\nIt never hurts to have a good set\nof factual data in front of you.\n\n607\n00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:57.040\nThat is exactly what Ronnie says is going\nhelp alleviate any of that opinionation\n\n608\n00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.570\nfrom behind the argument.\n\n609\n00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:00.120\nWe want to stick with the facts.\n\n610\n00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.140\nAnd let them be our guiding star\nwhen it comes to what should we do,\n\n611\n00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:07.440\nwhat should we not do in a project, and\nthat will help alleviate that conflict.\n\n612\n00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:13.570\nAnd Ronnie, there's always caveats,\nright, addendums, asides, special cases.\n\n613\n00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:15.240\nYou got a couple for us to help.\n\n614\n00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.390\nNow help us go through those.\n\n615\n00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:18.870\n>> When it comes down to special cases,\nright,\n\n616\n00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:22.680\nwe're not really talking about some\nparticular conflict that exists with\n\n617\n00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:26.010\nthe project itself or\nhow things are actually done.\n\n618\n00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:27.910\nWe're talking about dealing with people.\n\n619\n00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:33.450\nAnd that means personalities and of course\npersonal issues that may end up arising.\n\n620\n00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:35.310\nAnd when we start talking\nabout dealing with this,\n\n621\n00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:39.110\nthere's a couple of special\ncases that we need to deal with.\n\n622\n00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:40.350\nNow let's take a look here.\n\n623\n00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:44.135\nAnd I've went ahead and enumerated them\nfor us just a little bit, or listed them.\n\n624\n00:31:44.135 --> 00:31:48.580\nTeam member disputes, when you have\ntwo team members, essentially,\n\n625\n00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:51.409\ngoing after each other,\nfor whatever it is.\n\n626\n00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:53.121\nRemember that patience is the key,\n\n627\n00:31:53.121 --> 00:31:55.695\nfact-finding is pretty much\nwhat we want to do here.\n\n628\n00:31:55.695 --> 00:32:00.420\nNow when you do have this situation and\nthey agree on the facts, that's fine.\n\n629\n00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:05.323\nBut if you do have now where this dispute\nis not gonna be carried on, your best bet,\n\n630\n00:32:05.323 --> 00:32:07.383\nokay, at this point here, okay,\n\n631\n00:32:07.383 --> 00:32:11.720\nis to make sure it doesn't\ndevolve into personal issues.\n\n632\n00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:15.720\nOnce it devolves into personal issues,\nyou need to take yourself out of it.\n\n633\n00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.060\nAnd this now becomes an HR problem.\n\n634\n00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:22.200\nOkay, you, and you want to follow those\nstandards and guidelines by the T.\n\n635\n00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:27.150\nYou do not want it actually situated\nin there, where they tell HR that no,\n\n636\n00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:30.320\nhe said that I wouldn't ever\nface any consequences from this.\n\n637\n00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:32.260\nNo, you simply go,\n\n638\n00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:36.390\nthis has now devolved into personal\nissues where you're doing this.\n\n639\n00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.640\nAnd this is a Human Resource problem and\n\n640\n00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.030\nwe need to deal with it\naccording to those facts.\n\n641\n00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.650\nYou definitely want to make\nsure you stand by the policy.\n\n642\n00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:45.340\nYou don't deviate at all.\n\n643\n00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:48.850\nThe reason why is it can become\na legal issue very quickly if you do.\n\n644\n00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:53.170\nYou stood in my fair process of\ngetting this done the way I needed to.\n\n645\n00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:54.020\nNo I didn't.\nYes, you did,\n\n646\n00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.770\nwhen you told me to do this instead.\n\n647\n00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:57.390\nNope, make sure that you do that.\n\n648\n00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:02.300\nIf it devolves beyond whatever that\nteam member issue is that you can't, and\n\n649\n00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:05.150\nnow it becomes personal,\nyou're done, okay?\n\n650\n00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:08.050\nYou do not want to\nactually go beyond that.\n\n651\n00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:11.760\nNow, it could be that the resolution ends\nup being training for the person, right?\n\n652\n00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.000\nAnd this stuff happens, right?\n\n653\n00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.240\nIf it's some type of sexual harassment\nthing, you send them to training, but\n\n654\n00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.800\nagain HR will decide that.\n\n655\n00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.740\nWhether it's actually gonna\nbe training that they get or\n\n656\n00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:23.650\nwhether it's gonna be dismissal\nat some point, right?\n\n657\n00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:25.730\nDisciplinary action could be mediation,\n\n658\n00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:29.590\ncould be the idea of absolutely outright\nrelieving them of their job duties.\n\n659\n00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:32.820\nBut just realize that if it's a dispute\nlike this, where it devolves and\n\n660\n00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.470\nthat's this special issue, right?\n\n661\n00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:37.490\nit's not that there can't be disputes,\nnot that there can't be conflicts, but\n\n662\n00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:41.670\nif it now turns into personal issues where\nthey say, I just can't work with that guy.\n\n663\n00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:45.910\nYou go, okay, I'm done with this,\nbecause I can no longer,\n\n664\n00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:46.900\nthere's nothing that I can do.\n\n665\n00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.030\nThe main thing that we've talked\nabout that's going to work.\n\n666\n00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.118\n>> That right the human\nfactor is just that.\n\n667\n00:33:51.118 --> 00:33:55.390\nIs a factor, you've got to take it into\naccount, and sometimes that is going\n\n668\n00:33:55.390 --> 00:34:00.010\nto be the deciding vote on whether or not\nsomeone continues to work on a project or\n\n669\n00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:02.300\nnot and\nmaybe you might have to replace them.\n\n670\n00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:06.310\n>> Yeah, the other one, of course, is just\na regular disgruntled team member and\n\n671\n00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:09.340\nthis can actually happen very easily.\n\n672\n00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:15.630\nIf this happens you want to try and deal\nwith this privately as much as you can.\n\n673\n00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:18.930\nIf you can find out the reason for\n\n674\n00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:21.960\ntheir disgruntlement,\nwhatever it might be, right?\n\n675\n00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:26.960\nMake sure you listen but\nmake sure you stick to the facts, okay?\n\n676\n00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.790\nDo not ask them about how they,\nI know that sounds strange, but\n\n677\n00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:31.430\ndon't ask them about how they feel.\n\n678\n00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:34.000\nBut say, what is the actual issue and\n\n679\n00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.470\nproblem here that you can try and\naddress and get figured out here, okay?\n\n680\n00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:43.380\nAny negative statements that they make\ntowards you, towards a project, towards\n\n681\n00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:48.610\nwhatever it is, make sure they clarify\nby giving you not, this is how I feel.\n\n682\n00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:52.497\nBut pointing out actual things\nthat have happened to them or\n\n683\n00:34:52.497 --> 00:34:55.460\nthat they've actually noticed.\n\n684\n00:34:55.460 --> 00:35:01.900\nDon't sit there and go, well, that's just\nhow Ronnie is, he's just a loudmouth.\n\n685\n00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.420\nThat's not enough, right?\n\n686\n00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:07.970\nYou wanna actually go,\ncan you give me an actual example?\n\n687\n00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:13.080\nDid you have a conversation with\nRonnie that absolutely said this?\n\n688\n00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.210\nCan you tell me a time and\ndate that that happened?\n\n689\n00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:17.730\nMake sure you get those facts there.\n\n690\n00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:20.740\nWhat you might find out is, there's\nnothing that you can do to resolve this.\n\n691\n00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:24.310\nYou can't do anything else,\nwhile at that point,\n\n692\n00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:26.900\nmake sure whatever you actually\nhave to do, whether it's dismissal,\n\n693\n00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:30.650\nwhether it's anything else,\nthat you do it as quickly as possible.\n\n694\n00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:32.110\nBeing somebody that's disgruntled and\n\n695\n00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:34.490\nthey just get to work on\nthe project is never good.\n\n696\n00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:37.900\nIt is like that festering\nwound that doesn't close.\n\n697\n00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.980\nI had a friend that worked on\nan oil rig about 20 years ago, and\n\n698\n00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:44.070\nthis is one of the things that he told me.\n\n699\n00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:48.720\nHe said, they fly people out there, and\nyou're essentially stuck on that rig for\n\n700\n00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.110\nsix to nine months.\n\n701\n00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:53.830\nAnd he said the first thing that ends up\nhappening is that when a fight happens,\n\n702\n00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:57.970\nthey throw you both into a locked room for\novernight.\n\n703\n00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:00.220\nAnd you deal with it however you can.\n\n704\n00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.850\nThe next day they come out and\nthey ask if it's been resolved.\n\n705\n00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:06.410\nIf it's not been resolved,\nthey call a helicopter out and\n\n706\n00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:10.140\nthey get those two people off\nthe rig the following day.\n\n707\n00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.230\nThey get them off the rig, why?\n\n708\n00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:14.450\nBecause what happens if you\nleave those two on that rig?\n\n709\n00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:18.400\nIt will continue to denigrate\nthe entire working processes.\n\n710\n00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:22.400\nYou can imagine what it does when you're\nunder time constraints, money constraints,\n\n711\n00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:27.090\nand requirement constraints,\nhow quickly this can devolve.\n\n712\n00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:30.610\nSo make sure you actually do whatever\nyou do very quickly here and\n\n713\n00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:34.370\nget that resolved as quickly as possible\nwhen it's some type of disgruntlement.\n\n714\n00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:38.070\n>> Yeah, you may even be liable for some\nsort of criminal negligence if it devolves\n\n715\n00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:41.450\nto something like assault, or\ndare I say, even a murder charge.\n\n716\n00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:43.440\nPeople do kill people, it does happen.\n\n717\n00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.600\nAnd they usually do that because\nthey're angry with them.\n\n718\n00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.210\nSo, we gotta look out for those things and\nthat's a really great policy for\n\n719\n00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:53.760\nwhen you have people in\na confined closed space and\n\n720\n00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:55.570\nthey have no way to get\naway from each other.\n\n721\n00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:58.153\nSometimes you just have to go,\nyou know what, we're gonna cut our loses,\n\n722\n00:36:58.153 --> 00:37:00.531\nthanks for helping us out you guys,\nbut you are no longer necessary,\n\n723\n00:37:00.531 --> 00:37:01.688\nit's time to get you out of here.\n\n724\n00:37:01.688 --> 00:37:05.311\nThat is a great way to relieve\nthat conflict, just separate them.\n\n725\n00:37:05.311 --> 00:37:10.540\nAll right Ronnie, we have gone\nthrough a lot of conflict resolution.\n\n726\n00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:13.100\nA lot of how we can look at conflicts in\n\n727\n00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.320\nany parting words of wisdom\nbefore we wrap up the show?\n\n728\n00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.625\n>> This is gonna be important, right?\n\n729\n00:37:17.625 --> 00:37:19.190\nBecause we deal with people every day.\n\n730\n00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:22.340\nIf you're gonna be a project manager,\nthey're looking to you to lead.\n\n731\n00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:26.700\nIf you now lead and you deal with conflict\nresolution by avoiding it, guess what?\n\n732\n00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.300\nIt's not gonna be a very powerful team\nthat works for you on your project.\n\n733\n00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:33.660\nSo make sure you take a look\nabout managing these things, and\n\n734\n00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.030\nunderstand at least\nthe basic processes here.\n\n735\n00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:38.900\nGet a little bit more study if you're\nactually gonna be managing a big team,\n\n736\n00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.880\nbecause this stuff will end up happening.\n\n737\n00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.460\nBut overall though, if you're taking a\nlook at this and go man, this sounds like\n\n738\n00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:47.890\nsomething I want to get into,\ndo a little bit more training on your own.\n\n739\n00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:52.260\nAnd make sure you understand a little\nbit better, cuz it does get beyond\n\n740\n00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:56.550\nthe kind of little easy cartwheels or\nleapfrog that I just showed you here.\n\n741\n00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:59.370\nIt can get into some convoluted stuff, so\n\n742\n00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:02.310\njust make sure you actually\npay attention to your team.\n\n743\n00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:05.050\nBuild them up, make sure you\nunderstand and resolve their conflicts.\n\n744\n00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:05.750\n>> All right.\n\n745\n00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.530\nThank you so much, Ronnie,\nfor dropping by and\n\n746\n00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:09.400\nexplaining these awesome concepts to us.\n\n747\n00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:14.170\nSo we can resolve conflicts when we find\nthem and use these techniques to do so.\n\n748\n00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:16.600\nThat being said, it looks like we've\nwrapped up yet another great episode.\n\n749\n00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.780\nHopefully you guys enjoyed it and\nlearned something.\n\n750\n00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.570\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n751\n00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:22.350\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n752\n00:38:22.350 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:19.592\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.592 --> 00:00:21.990\nwe are continuing on\nwith our Project+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.040\nJoining us back in the studio\nagain today to help\n\n6\n00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.080\nfurther us on in that endeavor is our\ngood friend and mentor, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.757\nRonnie, welcome back, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:29.757 --> 00:00:31.003\nHow you doing?\n>> Well, thank you for\n\n9\n00:00:31.003 --> 00:00:32.130\nhaving me back on the show.\n\n10\n00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.310\nIt's great to be here again as we pick\nup on the idea of CompTIA's Project+.\n\n11\n00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.900\nWe're moving on into\nthe execution phase now, and\n\n12\n00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.560\nwhat we're actually taking a look at today\nof course is how in the world do we begin?\n\n13\n00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.070\nWhat do we need to do to ensure that we\ncan move from the planning into the realm\n\n14\n00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.620\nof execution, and ensure that everybody is\non the same page, is on the right foot,\n\n15\n00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.780\nis whatever cliche you want to give to it,\nis ready to go as we start the project.\n\n16\n00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.880\nWell, one of things that what\nwe want to actually consider and\n\n17\n00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.460\none thing you should absolutely consider.\n\n18\n00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.610\nIs the idea of starting with what\nwe call a project kick-off meeting.\n\n19\n00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.560\nNow, lot of times when you say that\nin a company where people aren't talk\n\n20\n00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.980\nabout project management,\nthey immediately go to the word party,\n\n21\n00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.580\nis what they think about, right?\n\n22\n00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.470\nCuz we say project kickoff, and for\n\n23\n00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.470\nsome reason kickoff sounds like it's\na Super Bowl party or something like that,\n\n24\n00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.450\na dance that you're about to start,\nsomething that you're actually having.\n\n25\n00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.230\nAnd don't get me wrong,\nyou can actually do that if you choose to,\n\n26\n00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.380\nif that's the tone that you wanna set,\nbut you wanna consider this because\n\n27\n00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.840\nthis is actually one of these great\nactivities that will really allow\n\n28\n00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.030\nyou to begin your project in\nthe way that you choose to begin.\n\n29\n00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.950\nSo we wanna take a look at the elements\nthat are normally involved\n\n30\n00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.530\nof this idea of a project kickoff meeting.\n\n31\n00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.620\nSo when you start to take\na look at something like this,\n\n32\n00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.960\nif you wanted to set it up as a party,\na very relaxed atmosphere, not a big deal.\n\n33\n00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.180\nYou can do so as long as you realize\nthat in this particular party,\n\n34\n00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.170\nthe goal here is not of course to actually\njust have a party, even though you\n\n35\n00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.720\nmight think that, but the goal is to make\nsure that information about the beginning\n\n36\n00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.310\nof the project needs to be relayed and\nwe need to have some event, right?\n\n37\n00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.960\nThat allows everybody to get a bunch\nof information all at one time.\n\n38\n00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.880\nSo this is probably one of the best\nways that we can start on a project,\n\n39\n00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.220\nis to get everybody together to\nhear some of the general things\n\n40\n00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.022\nfrom the project manager as\nwell as from the stakeholders.\n\n41\n00:02:32.022 --> 00:02:36.250\n>> Now Ronnie, is it normal for\nthese project kick off meetings to have\n\n42\n00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.400\nsome emphasis on a party-like atmosphere,\nas formal as that maybe as well?\n\n43\n00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.790\nI'm thinking of suits and\nties and things of that nature.\n\n44\n00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.340\nOr is it usually just that informal thing,\n\n45\n00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.590\nmaybe there is some refreshment but mostly\nwe're here to get down the business and\n\n46\n00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.542\ntalked about today, the project begins and\nhere's everyone needs to now.\n\n47\n00:02:52.542 --> 00:02:55.495\n>> And\nthat's kinda strange that you said that,\n\n48\n00:02:55.495 --> 00:02:59.974\nbecause I think you find us different\nin every location that you go to.\n\n49\n00:02:59.974 --> 00:03:02.316\nIn some situations that you're in,\n\n50\n00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:05.570\na formal project kickoff\nmeeting is exactly that.\n\n51\n00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.120\nWhere you bring essentially\nthe managers in and\n\n52\n00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.320\nthat you just ensure that\neverything's lined up and\n\n53\n00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.950\nthat they need to hear just\nthe information that you want.\n\n54\n00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.040\nBut I think as you move further and\nfurther away from\n\n55\n00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.930\nsettings in which there's a ton of formal\nproject management, it is more relaxed,\n\n56\n00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.720\nit is more of a party atmosphere\nthat you might end up seeing.\n\n57\n00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.890\nBut, it really does depend\non where you end up going.\n\n58\n00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.980\nThe key behind this\nparticular meeting though,\n\n59\n00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.110\nis to kinda set the tone for the way that\nthis project really does want to run.\n\n60\n00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.980\nIf you want to run it informally and make\nsure that everybody has a good time doing\n\n61\n00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.890\nit, you're gonna set that\nup in that meeting as well.\n\n62\n00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.610\nIf you want it to be run more\nbusiness like, don't get me wrong,\n\n63\n00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.440\nyou still have to get information through.\n\n64\n00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.070\nYou can actually show and exude that\ntone at that meeting in the first place.\n\n65\n00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.200\nSo, you've got to actually decide here,\nand\n\n66\n00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.762\nthis is something that\na project manager can decide.\n\n67\n00:03:58.762 --> 00:04:01.170\nEverybody can have a little bit\nof different experience with\n\n68\n00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.430\nproject managers.\n\n69\n00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.360\nSome of them are actually\ngoing to be very formal.\n\n70\n00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.510\nThey want you to make sure that everything\nis actually the way that it is.\n\n71\n00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.930\nSome are going to be very\nmuch more relaxed than that.\n\n72\n00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.630\nIt just depends on what\natmosphere you find yourself in.\n\n73\n00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.370\nAnd you got to define that, right?\n\n74\n00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.794\nIf you ended up working for a company,\n\n75\n00:04:15.794 --> 00:04:18.741\nthey'll just tell you this is what your\nproject kickoff meetings is gonna be.\n\n76\n00:04:18.741 --> 00:04:21.842\nYou might find yourself surprised,\nyou end up in a room with four walls, and\n\n77\n00:04:21.842 --> 00:04:23.850\nthere's just a couple of refreshments.\n\n78\n00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.460\nAnd there's nothing else.\n\n79\n00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.410\nAnd you're essentially just there for\na little bit of time just to make\n\n80\n00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.200\nsure that everybody actually understands\nwhen everything is starting,\n\n81\n00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.060\nand that's how it goes.\n\n82\n00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.760\nBut the recommendation here, though,\nis for you to set that tone,\n\n83\n00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.450\nis pretty much the key.\n\n84\n00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.600\nAnd then to make sure that everybody gets\nall the information that we want everybody\n\n85\n00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.300\nto have at one time, as well.\n\n86\n00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.930\nSo when we start taking a look then,\n\n87\n00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.320\nwhat needs to be included in\na project kickoff meeting?\n\n88\n00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.270\nWell I went ahead and\ncreated a diagram for\n\n89\n00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.540\nus, so that we can just take a look\nat some of the common elements\n\n90\n00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.660\nof what a project kickoff meeting\nis supposed to do for us here.\n\n91\n00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.190\nSo let's go ahead and focus in on\nthese elements is what we want to do.\n\n92\n00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.320\nFirst and foremost, you got to understand\nthat there is a purpose behind this.\n\n93\n00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.620\nThe overall purpose for\nus is now that we have everything in hand,\n\n94\n00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.550\nour plan and we're ready to start, is that\nwe know that there's just a certain amount\n\n95\n00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.460\nof information that we need to\ncommunicate to everyone and\n\n96\n00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.530\nwe need to make sure\nit's the same message.\n\n97\n00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.810\nOne of the worse things about the way that\nprojects can begin, is they can begin\n\n98\n00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.600\na bit disjointed in which one particular\nproject, as far as a work package goes.\n\n99\n00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.350\nLet's say that they go ahead and\nthey begin on their own because we thought\n\n100\n00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.140\nwe would begin a week ago but\nwe just didn't have a chance to.\n\n101\n00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.369\nWe went ahead and\nformally started that project process and\n\n102\n00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:42.824\nnow a week later we gather\npeople together and\n\n103\n00:05:42.824 --> 00:05:46.261\nwe essentially tell them that\nwe're gonna begin the project.\n\n104\n00:05:46.261 --> 00:05:48.216\nAnd all the sudden somebody\nlooks around and goes,\n\n105\n00:05:48.216 --> 00:05:50.920\nwell I thought the project began\nlast week, what's happening here?\n\n106\n00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.480\nSo, they feel a little bit left out\nabout what's actually going on.\n\n107\n00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.330\nBeing able to communicate the same message\nis the key here, to all the members,\n\n108\n00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.530\nat the same time that we all need to,\nis a good reason for us to do so.\n\n109\n00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.410\nNow, we don't have to\nhave these all the time.\n\n110\n00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.280\nIt does help to have some of these.\n\n111\n00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.980\nBut overall though, when you know that\nthere's certain things that need to go on\n\n112\n00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.500\nsuch as, we're going to talk about\norganizational governance in a little bit,\n\n113\n00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.180\nin another episode here.\n\n114\n00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.510\nBut, if you need to go over certain rules\nfor your project, things that absolutely,\n\n115\n00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.579\nthat everybody's gonna have to\nfollow on the project team,\n\n116\n00:06:25.579 --> 00:06:27.221\nthis is the place to set that up.\n\n117\n00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:29.770\nThe place to actually make\nsure that that goes over.\n\n118\n00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.430\nIf nobody knows who's actually leading\nyour project teams, this is a great\n\n119\n00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.040\nplace to ensure that everybody is actually\nable to be introduced and can see that.\n\n120\n00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.392\nAnd so this particular meeting at this\npoint really does help set that tone,\n\n121\n00:06:42.392 --> 00:06:47.070\nit allows us to be able to set the goal\noverall for the entire project.\n\n122\n00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.630\nAnd it really can be, if you choose to\nespecially when you're are dealing with\n\n123\n00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.250\nhuman resources, right, to begin that\nforming process of team development,\n\n124\n00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.540\nto be able to introduce everybody.\n\n125\n00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.880\nTo have them in that atmosphere\nwhere you're saying all right,\n\n126\n00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.850\nsome of you don't know each other, but\nyou are going to be working closely or\n\n127\n00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.650\nyou're going to be in coordination.\n\n128\n00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.690\nAnd guys,\nwe need you to work well together, okay.\n\n129\n00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.770\nSo being able to communicate to\neverybody all the stuff that needs to be\n\n130\n00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.940\nsaid to everybody at one time, another\ngreat reason to have a meeting like this.\n\n131\n00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.190\n>> Now Ronnie I see another one of your\nlovely little bullet points there,\n\n132\n00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.650\nis that you're communicating\nstakeholder expectation.\n\n133\n00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.040\nI don't think that enough emphasis\ncould probably be put on this,\n\n134\n00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.020\nbecause your stakeholders\nare kinda your backers.\n\n135\n00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.830\nThey're the people that are making\nthese projects happen so\n\n136\n00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:31.880\nif they have any questions.\n\n137\n00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.650\nThere's plenty of things that, this is\na great time that we can come together and\n\n138\n00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.690\nmake sure that we understand\nexactly what they want, and\n\n139\n00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.460\nthat we can communicate to them.\n\n140\n00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.515\nThat I understand exactly what you want.\n\n141\n00:07:43.515 --> 00:07:44.820\n[LAUGH]\n>> There's no doubt that what\n\n142\n00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.260\ncan happen is there's miscommunication\nthat can go on very easily.\n\n143\n00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.207\nEven myself, as a project manager,\nas I understand certain things, it doesn't\n\n144\n00:07:52.207 --> 00:07:56.286\nnecessarily mean that I've communicated\nclearly what the stakeholders believe.\n\n145\n00:07:56.286 --> 00:08:00.113\nSo one thing that you can do to make\nthis a little bit more personal for\n\n146\n00:08:00.113 --> 00:08:04.278\neverybody on the team Is to really\nbring your stakeholders together, and\n\n147\n00:08:04.278 --> 00:08:08.060\nallow them to actually communicate\nwhat their expectations are.\n\n148\n00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.090\nNow you might think well,\nwhy does that even matter?\n\n149\n00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.470\nThey're hired for a project and\n\n150\n00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.530\nit doesn't seem to matter if they're\nactually told exactly what to do.\n\n151\n00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.640\nBut it does matter in\nterms of their intent and\n\n152\n00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.470\nhow far they're willing to go\nto make this project happen.\n\n153\n00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:26.230\nI know that when people talk about certain\nevents that have happened in their lives,\n\n154\n00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.380\nright, and\nthey want to get something done.\n\n155\n00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.210\nThe easiest way is to bring\nabout a motivation that is\n\n156\n00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.420\noutside of just work and money.\n\n157\n00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.240\nIt allows them to be able to see\na connection to human, connection to\n\n158\n00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.750\nan event, and then they actually put\ntheir heart into it a little bit more.\n\n159\n00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.650\nThey even end up working a little bit\noutside of work on time because they're\n\n160\n00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.770\nstarting to think about\nthe project as well.\n\n161\n00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:50.800\nThink about any time in your particular\narea where somebody's actually said,\n\n162\n00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.660\nyou know, here is a person who\nreally needs our help right now.\n\n163\n00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:55.830\nAnd what do they always tell?\n\n164\n00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:01.020\nThey tell the story behind whatever\nthat event is, whether it's a charity\n\n165\n00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:08.480\nfundraiser, or\nwhether it's a there's a story that\n\n166\n00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.180\ngoes behind it and that really does bring\npeople in your community together for\n\n167\n00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.320\nthat whole thing but think about\nthe same thing with your project.\n\n168\n00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.060\nIf you're actually doing something\nspecial, let's say for something like that\n\n169\n00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.250\nwhere it's a community development center\nor a playground in the neighborhood and\n\n170\n00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.510\nyou want to say hey, here is where\nI grew up in this neighborhood.\n\n171\n00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.712\nI love this neighborhood and\nhere behind this and\n\n172\n00:09:29.712 --> 00:09:33.778\nyou introduce them to that factor,\nit allows the people on your team to,\n\n173\n00:09:33.778 --> 00:09:36.730\nto really put a face and\nwhy they really want that?\n\n174\n00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.050\nYou know, to be a part of what\nhas she expected of them.\n\n175\n00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.190\nSo it allows that say called have\nthat face to face communication and\n\n176\n00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.220\nlet them know that they are not\njust working for a corporation or\n\n177\n00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.910\nnot just working for\nan assigned project manager.\n\n178\n00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.260\nThey really doing this for\n\n179\n00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:54.480\nthe benefit something that they can\nactually now relate to directly.\n\n180\n00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.250\n>> Very cool Now, Ronnie, what are some of\nthe other common activities that we might,\n\n181\n00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.990\nI know if you eat the food and\ndrinking and get together and\n\n182\n00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:06.550\nstarting to build that team comradery is\ngreat and everything, but what are some of\n\n183\n00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.140\nthe other common things that we might\ndo during the kick off meeting?\n\n184\n00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.310\n>> Yeah, when you start taking a look\nat the idea of these kick off meetings,\n\n185\n00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:15.060\ngetting the stake holders to appear\nis kind of one of the big things\n\n186\n00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.230\nthat you want to do.\n\n187\n00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:20.900\nBut if you do this, you wanna make\nsure that as this is happening right,\n\n188\n00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.820\nthat you are also relaying to\nthe stakeholders what you want them to\n\n189\n00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:29.620\ncommunicate, that you want them to be\nthat human face to what they're doing, or\n\n190\n00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.050\nyou want them to communicate\nhow urgent this is or\n\n191\n00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:35.320\nwhatever it might be, because that's\nwhat they really need related.\n\n192\n00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.650\nAnd so if you think about it,\nat this particular point,\n\n193\n00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:41.340\nespecially with the stakeholder\ncommunication expectations here,\n\n194\n00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:45.480\nyou're really trying to ensure that they\ncommunicate as much as they can without\n\n195\n00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.770\nyou having to step in and\ninterpret it for them.\n\n196\n00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.250\nSo a little bit of coaching needs\nto be done if you're gonna do this.\n\n197\n00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.240\nThe other thing of course is to let\nthem hear from the project sponsor\n\n198\n00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.740\nif this is actually one of those types of\nproject in which is really good you know,\n\n199\n00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.950\nthat there is good PR behind it.\n\n200\n00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.500\nThe project sponsors that normally\ninitiate something like this, right?\n\n201\n00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.320\nThat absolutely sign off on it, are\nnormally gonna be people that really did\n\n202\n00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.080\nput their own money behind\nthat a lot of times or\n\n203\n00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.430\nthe organization's money behind it.\n\n204\n00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:18.010\nAnd what you want to do is you want to\ngive them a billing of sorts in this way.\n\n205\n00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.780\nNot actually just handing them the bill,\nbecause I mean,\n\n206\n00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.350\nthey're gonna be footing the bill for it.\n\n207\n00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.250\nBut you're actually saying,\nlook, here it is.\n\n208\n00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:27.750\nHere's your chance to rally the troops\nto give them some great you know,\n\n209\n00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:32.030\nstory or to give them something that\nthey can actually rally around.\n\n210\n00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:35.570\nSo that the rest of the project that\nthey know exactly what's happening here.\n\n211\n00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.940\nSo, you do need to do that,\nyou need to give some time to do that.\n\n212\n00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.230\nSometimes it's a little bit too much time,\nbut again,\n\n213\n00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:45.040\nwith coaching, you allow them to\nactually be able to function and\n\n214\n00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.830\ndo whatever else needs to be\ndone right then and there.\n\n215\n00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:52.410\nAnd that is a big part of what this\nproject kickoff meeting is about.\n\n216\n00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:56.780\nAnd you might think like I do, it's like,\nit's just another rah-rah session,\n\n217\n00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:58.200\nit's another cheerleading thing.\n\n218\n00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.640\nBut it really does help,\nespecially when people are together.\n\n219\n00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.370\nNot so much if you pull me in and say hey,\nlet me talk to you about this and\n\n220\n00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.870\nthat And don't get me wrong,\nI can get encouraged by stuff like that.\n\n221\n00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.740\nBut when you're in a group of people,\nand they're excited.\n\n222\n00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:12.240\nThey're having a good time.\n\n223\n00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.980\nThey're ready to listen.\n\n224\n00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.350\nAnd they're all involved, and\nyour friends are involved in it, and\n\n225\n00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:17.550\neverything is going on.\n\n226\n00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.940\nYou really do feel good about\nthe project that's before you.\n\n227\n00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.790\nSo you need to make sure\nthat that happens as well.\n\n228\n00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.890\nNow the other thing that you also want\nto do is make sure that you know,\n\n229\n00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.520\nyou got to realize that this\nis part of your project too.\n\n230\n00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.700\nIn other words, you got to relay\nsome details about your project\n\n231\n00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.400\nthat really do need to get out there.\n\n232\n00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.570\nOkay and when we start taking a look\nat this what we're talking about\n\n233\n00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:44.750\nnow are really high level types of\ntimeline things that we need to consider.\n\n234\n00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.200\nSo we don't need to go over\nthe entire budget, okay, and\n\n235\n00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.000\nbreak down every little thing.\n\n236\n00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.780\nBut we do need to emphasize that\nwe are on a budget, and that we do\n\n237\n00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:57.470\nhave certain levels that we have to\nactually maintain, we have to meet.\n\n238\n00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.060\nWe do have certain goals\nthat are in hand for that.\n\n239\n00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.720\nWe have certain costs that we need to\ntry and keep down, whatever it is.\n\n240\n00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.480\nWe want to make sure that we\ngo over high level budget.\n\n241\n00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.290\nWe want to make sure that we\nunderstand the schedule and\n\n242\n00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.440\nif the schedule is demanding,\nthat they understand that.\n\n243\n00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:16.600\nThat this is a demanding project that\nneeds to be completed in a certain\n\n244\n00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.980\ntime and what you're looking for is some\ntype of response from the overall crowd.\n\n245\n00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.480\nThat they believe that they can do it.\n\n246\n00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.260\n>> Okay.\n>> So that is pretty much the key,\n\n247\n00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.950\nis getting them on your side.\n\n248\n00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:30.340\nYou are now the coach at\nthis particular pep rally.\n\n249\n00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.120\nYou're trying to make sure that\neverybody understands that, and\n\n250\n00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.190\nthat this is actually a team ready to\ngo out and do whatever they need to do.\n\n251\n00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:41.620\n>> It's a really good time to set up\nthose guiding stars as they were.\n\n252\n00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.970\nHere are your objectives.\n\n253\n00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:44.340\nThey're not super detailed.\n\n254\n00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.990\nWe're not going to break down into the\nminutiae of everything that's going on.\n\n255\n00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:49.480\nThose are for later meetings.\n\n256\n00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.530\nThis is just to give you a great idea\nof what we're going to be doing,\n\n257\n00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.290\nhow we're going to\naccomplish those things.\n\n258\n00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:58.440\nIf you're questioning, what kind of\nmoney are we gonna spend on this?\n\n259\n00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.070\nHow much do I have in the budget for\nmy portion of the thing?\n\n260\n00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:02.660\nThat's what they're\ngonna help you out with.\n\n261\n00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.440\nThey're gonna show you, well,\nhere's what you can expect to spend.\n\n262\n00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.720\nAnd that'll give you a good general idea\nas a person that's a part of the project\n\n263\n00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.040\nteam to figure out what you're gonna be\ndoing and how you're gonna be doing it.\n\n264\n00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.180\nMaybe if you're like, the budget's\na little too low, now you know, hey,\n\n265\n00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:15.930\nyou know what?\n\n266\n00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:19.170\nI'm gonna have to tighten up the way\nI thought I was gonna do this, and\n\n267\n00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:22.810\nhave a different perspective than\nI did before this budget meeting.\n\n268\n00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.970\nSo it's a really good time to just set\nthose, like I said those guiding stars up\n\n269\n00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:31.790\nso that I can, or everyone that's in\nthe project team can follow them and\n\n270\n00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.900\nknow where they're gonna\nbe going with that.\n\n271\n00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.340\nRonnie what else can we expect\nfrom these kickoff meetings?\n\n272\n00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.810\n>> Well since you actually mentioned\nthe idea of projects and goals,\n\n273\n00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.040\nit's to make sure that they understand\nthey have leadership to help them, okay?\n\n274\n00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.970\nMost of the time you are going to\nget people that are going to be\n\n275\n00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:48.640\nin this particular kickoff meeting in\nwhich they're just told, you're coming to\n\n276\n00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.800\nthis because you're going to be on this\nteam that's going to be happening.\n\n277\n00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.050\nBut what you want them to\nactually understand as well,\n\n278\n00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:58.030\nis that you do have people that\nare there to help them along.\n\n279\n00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.610\nIn other words that can\nactually guide them and\n\n280\n00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:03.190\nlead them through a successful project.\n\n281\n00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:07.260\nSo when you do something like this, right,\nnot only do you have your stakeholders up\n\n282\n00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:11.600\nthere ready and going, not only have you\nreviewed some of the business like things,\n\n283\n00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.210\nbut you're essentially\nintroducing their team leaders.\n\n284\n00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.800\nWho are they going to count\non when they need help?\n\n285\n00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.400\nOkay?\n\n286\n00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.000\nThis let's them know that\ngood communication can go on.\n\n287\n00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.600\nIt actually puts in front of everybody,\nthe ability to know if\n\n288\n00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.400\nI need help I can go and\nfind that guy that's right there on stage.\n\n289\n00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.970\nI will go and ask Daniel.\n\n290\n00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.880\nIt let's them actually be able to do\nthat and now it has been formalized and\n\n291\n00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.840\nhas actually been broadcast out\nthere in the kick off meeting.\n\n292\n00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.640\nIt allows everybody to see that, so\nwhen you as a project manager and\n\n293\n00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.450\nyou stand up there and\n\n294\n00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:45.070\ngo all right let me introduce Dan Laurey\nhe is going to be heading up this.\n\n295\n00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.830\nAnd he's responsible for\nhere, here, and here.\n\n296\n00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:51.900\nAnd so when you need help\nthis is who you go to, or\n\n297\n00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:56.350\non direction on this as he takes over from\nthis phase this is what's going to happen.\n\n298\n00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:00.620\nWell now you've given everybody what that\nvisual as well as the idea of a person.\n\n299\n00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.428\nAnd what's going to happen\nis after this right?\n\n300\n00:16:02.428 --> 00:16:06.498\nIf there's a mingling that goes on,\nif there's steaks or\n\n301\n00:16:06.498 --> 00:16:11.976\nburgers that are severed They can go and\nstand beside Daniel and have a burger,\n\n302\n00:16:11.976 --> 00:16:17.454\nand just sit down, and have a soda, a soft\ndrink or two, to be able to just say,\n\n303\n00:16:17.454 --> 00:16:23.250\nhey, I know this guy, and I know if I need\nhelp I can go to him and we can do that.\n\n304\n00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.130\nAnd so it gives that idea there.\n\n305\n00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:29.690\nSo, just being able to project those\ngoals and those objectives are good,\n\n306\n00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:33.640\nbut we're now also showing them\nwho's also gonna be responsible and\n\n307\n00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.790\nwhat roles that people are gonna play.\n\n308\n00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:40.520\nAnd it helps to gel again,\npeople will end up falling in\n\n309\n00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.780\nline with leaders that they really do see\nand that they hear from and they trust.\n\n310\n00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.085\nSo this is your opportunity to do that,\ntoo.\n\n311\n00:16:47.085 --> 00:16:51.281\n>> Yeah, it's a really good ice breaker\nI found when you do a project kick off\n\n312\n00:16:51.281 --> 00:16:55.884\nmeetings that, maybe a lot of times I have\nnoticed, not myself I have never would\n\n313\n00:16:55.884 --> 00:17:00.354\nhave this happen for me but I've heard\nabout this, you might be intimidated by\n\n314\n00:17:00.354 --> 00:17:03.710\nthe fact that you have a new boss or\na manager as it were.\n\n315\n00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:04.996\nYou don't know anything about them.\n\n316\n00:17:04.996 --> 00:17:07.040\nHow are they going to work with you?\n\n317\n00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.049\nSo, it's a really good place for you guys\nto come together and, like Ronnie said,\n\n318\n00:17:11.049 --> 00:17:14.250\nshare a burger and a coke and\nstart to learn about each other.\n\n319\n00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.239\nAnd now I know what to\nexpect from my manager and\n\n320\n00:17:16.239 --> 00:17:17.890\nthey know what to expect from me.\n\n321\n00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.050\nThey start to get a sense\nof my personality and\n\n322\n00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:23.290\nmy characteristics, all my traits\n>> And that's gonna,\n\n323\n00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.680\nif they're a good project manager, they're\ngonna be able to use that and go, well,\n\n324\n00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.620\nI know Dan doesn't work great\nif I'm micro-managing him.\n\n325\n00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.770\nIf I'm over his shoulder\nevery five seconds,\n\n326\n00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:34.460\nbecause of the way that we\ninteract at the kickoff meeting,\n\n327\n00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.970\nI saw that he's much more relaxed,\nmore laidback.\n\n328\n00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.620\nHe's a much more hands off kind of guy.\n\n329\n00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:43.502\nHe feels like if you're all up in his\nspace, then he's going to shrink down,\n\n330\n00:17:43.502 --> 00:17:48.094\nhe's gonna feel constrained, and\nnot perform as well as he possibly could.\n\n331\n00:17:48.094 --> 00:17:51.520\nAnd the same thing, if you were the\nproject manager, you get that sense, I see\n\n332\n00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:56.410\nthat, you know what, Ronnie likes to have\na little more, he needs an atta boy every\n\n333\n00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:59.250\nnow and then, right, he needs that pat on\nthe back, and it just keeps him motivated.\n\n334\n00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:02.160\nIt's a great place for\nthat kind of thing to start.\n\n335\n00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.750\nThat's an impetus for that, and\nonce you get those things figured out,\n\n336\n00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.300\nyou're going to have a much\nmore productive team and\n\n337\n00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.970\nthey're going to mesh better together and\nbe more productive.\n\n338\n00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.246\n>> There's no doubt that what\nDaniel is mentioning is the idea of\n\n339\n00:18:13.246 --> 00:18:14.003\nmanagement style.\n\n340\n00:18:14.003 --> 00:18:16.562\nYou're actually able to show\nthat as a project manager,\n\n341\n00:18:16.562 --> 00:18:19.817\nyou're showing your management style\nwhen you bring other people up and\n\n342\n00:18:19.817 --> 00:18:23.446\nthey take the foreground as leadership\nthrough the actual project ,while those\n\n343\n00:18:23.446 --> 00:18:26.380\nare the ones that you're directly\ngonna be communicating with,\n\n344\n00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.030\nit means that they don't worry\nabout two bosses, right?\n\n345\n00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.918\nThat they worry about whoever\ntheir project leader is,\n\n346\n00:18:31.918 --> 00:18:36.300\ninstead of just what the project\nmanager's actually expecting of them.\n\n347\n00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.590\nSo, you can actually\ncommunicate all that stuff.\n\n348\n00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:42.820\nNow, once you do that, you can get all\nof the business stuff that you want and\n\n349\n00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:46.930\nmake sure that everybody's actually there\nand does everything that they need.\n\n350\n00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:50.680\nWell, then you wanna open it up at times\nhere for questions and answers and\n\n351\n00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.980\nthat's pretty much what we do.\n\n352\n00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.330\nIs there any other questions and\nanswers that you can give or\n\n353\n00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:58.890\nthat your team can give?\n\n354\n00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.990\nThis is your chance to be able\nto do something like that.\n\n355\n00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.150\nAnd they'll really help out, right?\n\n356\n00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:07.920\nIt allows them to see that you're not the\nonly that's gonna be giving answers and\n\n357\n00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.130\ndoesn't take you a long time,\n\n358\n00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:13.400\nif you're allowing everybody that you\nactually bring up as your team leaders.\n\n359\n00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.090\nWhoever's gonna help you\nmanage this project,as well or\n\n360\n00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:17.570\npush through the project.\n\n361\n00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:20.190\nIt's gonna actually show\na lot better on people.\n\n362\n00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:24.070\nSo, being able to provide, again,\nanswering those questions,\n\n363\n00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.880\nmake sure that they understand\nagain about time clarity,\n\n364\n00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.030\nmake sure that everything that\nthey're actually pushing for, right?\n\n365\n00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.350\nAll those questions get answers,\nit's a great time for\n\n366\n00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.380\nreview of those things as well.\n\n367\n00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.000\nPeople will always have other additional\nquestions as the project moves on, but\n\n368\n00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.400\nat the very beginning,\nas many questions as you can answer, and\n\n369\n00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:46.130\nmake sure that they understand\nthat the better it's going to be.\n\n370\n00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:50.020\nNow, just because I talked about it,\nand we mentioned it here,\n\n371\n00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:54.520\nthat a project kick off meeting can\nbe any style, how do you know, or\n\n372\n00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.670\nheck we're not gonna remember\neverything that's included in it, but\n\n373\n00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:00.800\nlet's kind of go over just\na couple things here too, so.\n\n374\n00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:06.600\nOn my screen, I went ahead and\nI made a project kickoff meeting agenda.\n\n375\n00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.490\nYou don't have to actually\nlay it out this formally.\n\n376\n00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:12.300\nBut if you wanted to,\nas you start to actually go alright,\n\n377\n00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:17.120\nwe're now moving from that planning phase,\ninto now our execution phase,\n\n378\n00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.530\nthe very first thing we want of\ncourse is a kickoff meeting, and\n\n379\n00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:25.620\nwhat you wanna do is make sure that you\nmake an agenda, is pretty much the key.\n\n380\n00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:30.610\nIf not, it can really denigrate and\nreally fall apart very quickly,\n\n381\n00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:34.140\nif you don't have in mind what\nit is that you want to cover.\n\n382\n00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.310\nNow, at the beginning here,\n\n383\n00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.940\nis just a welcome telling them\nexactly why they're there, of course.\n\n384\n00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:39.870\nAnd then,\n\n385\n00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:44.420\nyou can start making introductions right\naway, because that's why people are there.\n\n386\n00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:47.400\nThey're trying to figure out how\neverything's actually gonna work out for\n\n387\n00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.330\nthem, where they're\nactually gonna be as well.\n\n388\n00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:52.270\nSo, you can have sometimes,\n\n389\n00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:56.910\ndepending on the way that, my screen is,\nlet me see, if I zoom out.\n\n390\n00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:58.630\nThere we go, my screen here.\n\n391\n00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:02.010\nTeam members, they can introduce\nthemselves and their entire teams,\n\n392\n00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:04.005\nif it's small enough for\nthem to be able to do so.\n\n393\n00:21:04.005 --> 00:21:05.580\nIf it's in a very large setting,\n\n394\n00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.460\nyou may just choose to introduce\nthe team leader, okay?\n\n395\n00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:11.410\nIf you do have remote teams, and this is\nsomething that you do want to consider\n\n396\n00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.980\nthat I didn't mention\na little bit earlier here.\n\n397\n00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.770\nWhat if you do have a team, though, but\nthey're located a thousand miles away?\n\n398\n00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:19.215\nYou want to include them, so\n\n399\n00:21:19.215 --> 00:21:22.476\nmake sure that they're also part\nof the introductions as well.\n\n400\n00:21:22.476 --> 00:21:26.437\nWhether you're bringing them through some\nmeeting like GoToMeeting or Skype or\n\n401\n00:21:26.437 --> 00:21:30.041\nwhatever it is, but you do, you wanna\ngive them a chance to also be a part of\n\n402\n00:21:30.041 --> 00:21:34.080\nthis in that way, where they're actually\nknowing that they're gonna be there.\n\n403\n00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.105\nDo no leave them out is what I'm saying,\n\n404\n00:21:36.105 --> 00:21:38.320\nis trying to make sure\nyou understand that.\n\n405\n00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.038\nIntroduce those project sponsor and\nthose key stakeholders,\n\n406\n00:21:42.038 --> 00:21:44.790\ngiving them the time that they need.\n\n407\n00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:47.690\nAfter that, you can present that\noverview and those goals and\n\n408\n00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:50.220\nexpectations that you\nwant them to understand.\n\n409\n00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:54.420\nAnd then from that point on, it can\nbe just communication at this point.\n\n410\n00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.380\nWhat is the roles and responsibilities?\n\n411\n00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.450\nMake sure that the people that actually\ngo up there as you coach them,\n\n412\n00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.450\nintroduce their role and\ntheir responsiblity.\n\n413\n00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:04.570\nAnd of course,\nyou wanna do yourself first.\n\n414\n00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:07.120\nAnd then your team leaders and\nwhat they're gonna be doing.\n\n415\n00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:07.830\nAnd remote teams,\n\n416\n00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:11.650\nmake sure everybody understands who's\nactually working on the project.\n\n417\n00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.080\nAnd then, of course, questions and\n\n418\n00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.480\nanswers, make sure everybody\ngets an opportunity.\n\n419\n00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.690\nWhat you don't wanna do is say, all right,\n\n420\n00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:20.810\nnobody's asked a question here,\nI'm cutting off questions, okay?\n\n421\n00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:23.800\nGive people a chance and then also\nsay something like that at the end.\n\n422\n00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:28.970\nLike, look, we're now going to just have a\nbrief party whether it's just some donuts,\n\n423\n00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:31.620\nif that's what it happens to be or\nsome coffee.\n\n424\n00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:35.130\nOr just say, look, we're going to give\neverybody a chance just to mingle and\n\n425\n00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.250\nalso to ask questions of the team\nleaders that are out here.\n\n426\n00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.300\nMake sure that they have that opportunity.\n\n427\n00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.840\nThe key here is buy-in.\n\n428\n00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.690\nThat's really what\nthe overall goal is about.\n\n429\n00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:49.430\nWe want to communicate everything that we\nneed to communicate at the beginning but\n\n430\n00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:52.786\nthe key is what, this is an initial way\nthat you can get every team member to\n\n431\n00:22:52.786 --> 00:22:55.984\nessentially buy-in, that they're\ngoing to be a part of this team and\n\n432\n00:22:55.984 --> 00:22:58.314\nthey're going to be a valuable\npart of this team and\n\n433\n00:22:58.314 --> 00:23:00.467\nthey're going to have\na successful project.\n\n434\n00:23:00.467 --> 00:23:04.317\n>> Yeah, because once they're sold out for\nthe project, they're going to put their\n\n435\n00:23:04.317 --> 00:23:08.059\nhearts, soul and everything they got into\nthat project to make it successful and\n\n436\n00:23:08.059 --> 00:23:09.504\nbe as productive as possible.\n\n437\n00:23:09.504 --> 00:23:14.298\nSo, kickoff meetings, obviously,\nare a great way to help settle\n\n438\n00:23:14.298 --> 00:23:18.360\nthat to your team and\nget them invested as you like.\n\n439\n00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:22.740\nRonnie, you've done a great job of showing\nus the importance of a kickoff meeting.\n\n440\n00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.322\nWe thank you for stopping by,\njoining us, and doing that for us, cuz,\n\n441\n00:23:25.322 --> 00:23:27.791\nwho better than Mr. Ronnie Wong to\ndemonstrate those points to us.\n\n442\n00:23:27.791 --> 00:23:30.847\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That being said,\n\n443\n00:23:30.847 --> 00:23:33.370\nlooks like we've wrapped up yet\nanother great episode.\n\n444\n00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.600\nAgain, thanks for joining us and\nwe thank you for watching.\n\n445\n00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.920\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n446\n00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.550\nDaniel Lawrie.\n\n447\n00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:40.416\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n448\n00:23:40.416 -->

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:18.373\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.373 --> 00:00:21.382\nin today's episode we're continuing\non with our Project+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.382 --> 00:00:25.263\nJoining us back in the studio again, today\nto lend his gigantic expertise on that\n\n6\n00:00:25.263 --> 00:00:28.940\nvery topic is none other than our good\nfriend and mentor, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.400\nRonnie, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.940\n>> Well, thank you for\nhaving me on the show.\n\n9\n00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.690\nAs we continue on taking a look\nat CompTIA's Project+ and\n\n10\n00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.700\nwe're moving into that execution phase,\nright?\n\n11\n00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.160\nWhere we've gone through the project\nsetup phase or the initiation,\n\n12\n00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.020\nwe've talked a lot about planning, and\nnow we're actually into the execution.\n\n13\n00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.550\nAnd we've just really gone over,\n\n14\n00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.020\nat least in the episodes that we're\ntaking a look at, in the execution phase,\n\n15\n00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.030\nwe've really only dealt with the idea\nhere of having a project kickoff meeting.\n\n16\n00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.590\nAnd we need to discuss\na little bit more in depth on\n\n17\n00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.950\none of the topics that we normally cover\nduring that project kickoff meeting, but\n\n18\n00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.730\nit's not the time that you\nbring out the party hats.\n\n19\n00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.410\nIt's not the time that you kinda sit down\nand you start dancing to the music part.\n\n20\n00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.170\nIt's in one of those parts where we\nhave to give a lot of information out.\n\n21\n00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.641\nAnd so when you start actually\nseeing this type of information,\n\n22\n00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:21.188\nmost of the time people will kinda\nget a little bit glassy-eyed.\n\n23\n00:01:21.188 --> 00:01:22.964\n[LAUGH] I don't know how\nelse to describe it.\n\n24\n00:01:22.964 --> 00:01:26.855\nBut there's a lot of things that have to\ngo on, and one of those things, of course,\n\n25\n00:01:26.855 --> 00:01:30.092\nis the idea of working with what\nwe call organizational governance.\n\n26\n00:01:30.092 --> 00:01:32.720\nI'm gonna say government is\nwhat's gonna end up happening.\n\n27\n00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.400\nOrganizational governance.\n\n28\n00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.410\nNow what the heck is\norganizational governance about?\n\n29\n00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.200\nThe very fact that our organizations of\ncourse, they do have to follow rules like\n\n30\n00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.890\nfederal regulations sometimes, or state\nregulations if you're here in the states,\n\n31\n00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.390\nor even industry-wide regulations\nthat are also out there.\n\n32\n00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.780\nSelf regulations that are also there too.\n\n33\n00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.420\nAnd so a lot of times, organizations,\nessentially, they end up following\n\n34\n00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.280\npolicies and procedures that now also\nend up applying to your project, even\n\n35\n00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.610\nthough you might go, well my project's\nnot really a part of the organization.\n\n36\n00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.449\nBut because it's sponsored by that\norganization, or they're the ones\n\n37\n00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.489\nputting up the money for it, your project\ndoes have to fall inline with that.\n\n38\n00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.440\nLet me kind of give you an example\nof what I'm talking about here.\n\n39\n00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.417\nLet's say that what you end up doing is\nyou end up working for an organization in\n\n40\n00:02:22.417 --> 00:02:26.587\nwhich, let's say, recycling is really big,\nplastic recycling is really big.\n\n41\n00:02:26.587 --> 00:02:31.560\nWhen you actually start doing that, what\nyou found out is that organization says,\n\n42\n00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.474\nlook, we recycle as much\nplastic as possible and\n\n43\n00:02:34.474 --> 00:02:37.440\nthis applies to every single department.\n\n44\n00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.400\nAnd now you're actually\npart of a project right?\n\n45\n00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.250\nAnd you're a project manager in\none of those departments and\n\n46\n00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.510\nit's a functional organization and\n\n47\n00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.380\nthat means that that plastic recycling\nalso goes into your project to where now,\n\n48\n00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.740\neven on your project, you have to actually\nuse as much recycled plastic as possible.\n\n49\n00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.008\nSo notice that what happened here is that\neven though your project may not really\n\n50\n00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:04.219\nhave to do with anything that's the\nfunctional nature of that organization.\n\n51\n00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:08.563\nBut because its essentially an offshoot of\nthe organization that's actually gonna be\n\n52\n00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:11.820\ndeveloped, you still have to\nfollow those rules, okay?\n\n53\n00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.171\nSo you might thing like, wow,\ndo we really have to do that?\n\n54\n00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:15.286\nYes, okay?\n\n55\n00:03:15.286 --> 00:03:20.168\nOrganizational governance is one of those\nthings that really does bring you into\n\n56\n00:03:20.168 --> 00:03:24.440\nwhat the world likes to call the world\nof compliance is what it is.\n\n57\n00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.053\nAnd Daniel, compliance is not our favorite\nthing, but it is important, right?\n\n58\n00:03:29.053 --> 00:03:32.080\n>> It's definitely important and\nRonnie is right.\n\n59\n00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.295\nIt's definitely a double\nedged sword we need it,\n\n60\n00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:36.572\nbecause it keeps us from having a problem,\nright.\n\n61\n00:03:36.572 --> 00:03:38.800\nIt keeps us out of trouble,\nthat's always a good thing.\n\n62\n00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.570\nIt keeps us from overstepping our bounds,\nalso a good thing.\n\n63\n00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.710\nBut it is where you take that your project\nis basically like a little Faberge egg and\n\n64\n00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.320\nwe put it inside of all this packaging and\nwe pull up that giant red tape gun and\n\n65\n00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.700\nwe go buck wild with it and\njust wrap it all up.\n\n66\n00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.691\nThat's basically what we're talking about\nwhen it comes to governance, rigth,\n\n67\n00:03:57.691 --> 00:03:59.210\nthe organizational governance.\n\n68\n00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.410\nHey did you submit that form before you\nrequisitioned that piece of equipment?\n\n69\n00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.790\nWell no I didn't.\n\n70\n00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.425\nYou have to be compliant.\n\n71\n00:04:07.425 --> 00:04:12.060\nAnd sometimes our own companies even\nimplement their own set of standards and\n\n72\n00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.550\nsay, well you have to follow our\nprocedures because that's the way we make\n\n73\n00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.558\nsure things get done correctly.\n\n74\n00:04:18.558 --> 00:04:22.719\nAnd it can be a real hassle but\nagain it's gonna save your bacon at any\n\n75\n00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:27.250\ngiven time where you followed compliance\nand now you're not in trouble.\n\n76\n00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.976\nBecause you followed compliance\neven though something horrible may\n\n77\n00:04:29.976 --> 00:04:30.640\nhave happened.\n\n78\n00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.640\nYou know that Faberge egg\nwas broken In transit,\n\n79\n00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.780\nwell, that's not your fault,\nyou followed compliance.\n\n80\n00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.610\nYou did exactly what you were supposed\nto do by taking out the red tape gun and\n\n81\n00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.060\nfollowing procedure and that's really\nwhat were talking about today.\n\n82\n00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.180\nRight, Ronnie?\n>> It really is,\n\n83\n00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.740\nwhen you start taking what the very fact\nis your project does not get to live by\n\n84\n00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.800\nit's own set of rules.\n\n85\n00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.600\nRegardless, of what you believe even\nthough you're the project manager.\n\n86\n00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.540\nBecause your project doesn't exist in\na vacuum, it exists as part of a team or\n\n87\n00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.880\npart of a company.\n\n88\n00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.997\nThat's actually sponsoring your project,\nit means those rules also apply to you.\n\n89\n00:05:00.997 --> 00:05:03.910\nYou might be wondering why is this so\nimportant?\n\n90\n00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.290\nThe compliance measures that Daniel just\ntold us about are really exactly that.\n\n91\n00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.360\nIn other words, it gives us that\nability to be able to assign\n\n92\n00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.130\nblame when we need to,\nis what it really does.\n\n93\n00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.940\nSo, let me kinda give you a for instance\nhere about what can happen on some\n\n94\n00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.320\nprojects such as security\nminded projects that go on.\n\n95\n00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.740\nIf Daniel and I, let's say that both\nof us were actually working on two\n\n96\n00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.690\ndifferent projects, our boss came in and\nsaid, here's what I want to here,\n\n97\n00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.350\nI want to see this security measure\nimplemented and here's what I want.\n\n98\n00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.660\nI want the best possible security for\n\n99\n00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.580\nbreaching against the outside\nof my network here.\n\n100\n00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.430\nDaniel goes about doing it his way,\nI go about doing it my way.\n\n101\n00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.440\nBoth of us believe we\nare 100% right in the way and\n\n102\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.230\nthe approach that we\nactually attach to doing it.\n\n103\n00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.380\nBut let's say that the way that I did it\nthough doesn't follow the companies rules\n\n104\n00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.870\nand guidelines but Daniel's does, okay.\n\n105\n00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.840\nSo when we finish let's say that\nwe both now have two competing\n\n106\n00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.050\nprojects here that implement that security\nand the way that we want it to and\n\n107\n00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.620\nnow a security breach happens.\n\n108\n00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.779\nLet's say it happens to both of\nus at this particular point.\n\n109\n00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:12.605\nOkay, both in the sense\nhere that a breach happen,\n\n110\n00:06:12.605 --> 00:06:17.400\nwell even when a breach happens at\nthis point, right, who's in the wrong?\n\n111\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.120\nDaniel implemented security in the way\nthat he needed to, follow the rules.\n\n112\n00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.035\nHe implemented the best\nway that he knew how to.\n\n113\n00:06:23.035 --> 00:06:24.381\nI implemented mine.\n\n114\n00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:26.110\nI said, I don't care about those rules.\n\n115\n00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.370\nI went ahead and did it anyways,\nand I still got a breach.\n\n116\n00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.260\nIn this sense,\n\n117\n00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.980\nwhat happens then is somebody else can\ncome in and audit between the two of us.\n\n118\n00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.440\nAnd what are they auditing for?\n\n119\n00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.310\nThey're actually seeing,\n\n120\n00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.960\ndid we actually follow the rules\nthat we needed to to ensure that we\n\n121\n00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.530\ndid everything that we possibly could\nto make the best possible defense.\n\n122\n00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.150\nNow, I made mine, but\nthey realized something during that audit.\n\n123\n00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.140\nI didn't follow any of those standards,\nany of those rules.\n\n124\n00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.910\nDaniel did.\n\n125\n00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.280\nWhen it comes down to it\nwho's going to be in trouble?\n\n126\n00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.982\nThe person that doesn't\nfollow those complaints and\n\n127\n00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:57.165\nthose standards that are out there.\n\n128\n00:06:57.165 --> 00:07:00.930\nAnd so, the same thing applies to\nanything that your company is doing.\n\n129\n00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.340\nIf there are federal regulations, if there\nare state or local regulations out there.\n\n130\n00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.060\nIf you are supposed to follow\nindustry standards, right.\n\n131\n00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.150\nThen you have to follow them.\n\n132\n00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.010\nAnd that's important that all your\nteam members understand that,\n\n133\n00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.850\nbecause there's that cliche again,\nthe ends don't justify the means.\n\n134\n00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:22.080\nThat even if I produce a product that I\nthink is good, if I didn't follow those\n\n135\n00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.400\nand it goes against what my company says\nis valuable to them, then that particular\n\n136\n00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.910\nproject, right, might actually still\nbe considered a failure at that point.\n\n137\n00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:35.110\nIf I don't actually say I really believe\nthat the organizational's governance\n\n138\n00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.560\nreally applies to my project as well.\n\n139\n00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.745\nSo when it comes down to comp t of them,\nokay,\n\n140\n00:07:39.745 --> 00:07:42.332\nbecause if you go to pmp\nyou'll see a different list,\n\n141\n00:07:42.332 --> 00:07:46.381\nif you go to some other project management\nbooks you'll also see a different list.\n\n142\n00:07:46.381 --> 00:07:50.461\nBut what's important to us since we're\nstudying and we're preparing for\n\n143\n00:07:50.461 --> 00:07:53.763\nthe CompTIA Project+ exam is\nthat we need to understand what\n\n144\n00:07:53.763 --> 00:07:57.602\nare the factors of organizational\ngovernance according to CompTIA?\n\n145\n00:07:57.602 --> 00:08:01.616\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nthose four is what we're gonna do here.\n\n146\n00:08:01.616 --> 00:08:04.376\nWhen it breaks down there's\nactually four different\n\n147\n00:08:04.376 --> 00:08:08.303\nmeasures of organizational governance\nthat comp t essentially calls out,\n\n148\n00:08:08.303 --> 00:08:12.470\nand the first one is the one that we've\nbeen, I don't want to say harping on, but\n\n149\n00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:17.010\nwe've been talking about so far,\nwhich is the idea of standards compliance.\n\n150\n00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.010\nVery much one of the most\nimportant aspects that we have.\n\n151\n00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:24.630\nIf your business absolutely does\nwork within the state laws,\n\n152\n00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:28.180\nwithin the local laws, within the federal\nlaws, within anything, right?\n\n153\n00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.130\nThat means that your\ncompany exists legally,\n\n154\n00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:31.850\nand there are standards\nthat are put there.\n\n155\n00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:36.500\nWhether it's by an environmental concern,\nlike here in the United States right,\n\n156\n00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.780\nit's gonna be the EPA,\nthe Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n157\n00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.450\nIf it's something with telecommunications\nlike I know what I'll do, I'll tap into\n\n158\n00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:48.360\nDaniel's office lines instead and\nI'm violating now federal communications.\n\n159\n00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.970\nWell that again is not something that we\nwant to do even though that might get me\n\n160\n00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.110\naround and do my project but\nI can't do that.\n\n161\n00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:59.020\nSo our organization normally\ndoes end up stating this here\n\n162\n00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:02.830\nthat we're to follow those same laws and\nwhatever the regulations are.\n\n163\n00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:06.320\nYou don't want to find yourself outside\nof compliance is what we don't.\n\n164\n00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.140\nThe other thing that\nDaniel also mentioned here\n\n165\n00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.610\nthat's usually included is what we call\nthe internal process compliance, okay.\n\n166\n00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:17.580\nNow when we start talking about the idea\nin the internal process compliance,\n\n167\n00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:22.620\nthis means that the way that you go about\ndoing certain things in your organization\n\n168\n00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.610\nthey again,\nalso have to be by the book as well, okay.\n\n169\n00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.970\nSo Daniel is one of my project leaders,\nlet's say for an example.\n\n170\n00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.950\nAnd he realizes that he\nneeds a piece of equipment,\n\n171\n00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:37.640\nokay, that is really just\nright down the hallway.\n\n172\n00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.240\nWell, Daniel just says, I'll just go ahead\nand borrow that piece of equipment, okay.\n\n173\n00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.370\nAnd I'll use it, and\nI'll put it back when it's done.\n\n174\n00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.080\nIn the meantime, somebody else goes and\nlook for that piece of equipment,\n\n175\n00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.700\nthat supposed to actually be in charge of\nthat piece of equipment and it's gone.\n\n176\n00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:57.150\nWell, Daniel you know he took it,\nhe used it, he said what?\n\n177\n00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:01.090\nYou know I'm part of the company,\nwhat's the big deal here.\n\n178\n00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.860\nWell, the big deal is somebody that\nthat piece of equipment was assigned to\n\n179\n00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.130\nthey're supposed to have access to it and\nDaniel doesn't.\n\n180\n00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:10.740\nWell, at this point,\nthere's a couple of different issues here.\n\n181\n00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.760\nOne, the person can't get their work done.\n\n182\n00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.200\nTwo, where the heck did the piece\nof equipment go to the person who's\n\n183\n00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.590\nresponsible for that?\n\n184\n00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:18.320\nThey don't have a clue.\n\n185\n00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.840\nThey don't have any knowledge\nof where it actually went.\n\n186\n00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.940\nSo when it comes out to internal processes\none of the things that you may find\n\n187\n00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.170\nout in the organization that you're in, is\nthat they normally require some paperwork.\n\n188\n00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.100\nAnd Daniel, we love paperwork.\n\n189\n00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.840\n>> It is our favorite thing\nin the whole world and\n\n190\n00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.570\nI'm just gonna give you a little\npersonal experience here.\n\n191\n00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.210\nI have actually gotten in trouble for and\n\n192\n00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:46.100\nI thought when I got hired in my young\nfoolishness that you hired me to do a job.\n\n193\n00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.170\nI'm just gonna do this job.\n\n194\n00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.250\nI'm gonna do it to the best of my ability.\n\n195\n00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.450\nYou wind me up, I'm like a robot.\n\n196\n00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.070\nYou stick me in the way you want me to go.\n\n197\n00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:54.420\nI take off and\nI don't stop until the task is completed.\n\n198\n00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.510\nWhat I didn't realize is that when you\nget into an organization, sometimes they\n\n199\n00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:02.550\nhave procedures that you need to\nfollow before you wind yourself up and\n\n200\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.270\nstick yourself in that situation.\n\n201\n00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:10.630\nSo I was supposed to be filling out\na basically a change management log.\n\n202\n00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:14.770\nI thought that the log was\nsupposed to be in a way where\n\n203\n00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:18.823\nI do work when I'm done I type up what I\ndid and there's the change management log.\n\n204\n00:11:18.823 --> 00:11:20.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's not how it works what you're\n\n205\n00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:26.640\nsupposed to do is once you've been\nassigned a change you then say,\n\n206\n00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.670\nI have now received the change,\nyou type it, I now have this change, and\n\n207\n00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.440\nI am going to begin working on this.\n\n208\n00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:36.350\nYou do some work, and then every change\nyou make, you document as you go.\n\n209\n00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.850\nAnd therefore,\nI was being pulled before the boss, and\n\n210\n00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:42.010\ntold why aren't you updating\nyour change management system.\n\n211\n00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:44.780\nI think I said, I am, I do it every\ntime I get done with a project.\n\n212\n00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:49.290\nThey go, no you do it while you're doing\nthe project everything you do needs to be\n\n213\n00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:53.740\ndocumented as soon as it is done not one\nthe entirety the project is over where we\n\n214\n00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.890\ncan monitor what it is your doing if\nanything we deem seems need to be change\n\n215\n00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:01.060\nwe can catch you at that point and\nnot when everything is said and done.\n\n216\n00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:02.940\nThis is the kind of thing\nthat we are talking about.\n\n217\n00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.860\nDoes it slow me down from doing my job?\n\n218\n00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.660\nIt sure did it slowed me down a lot\nbecause Now I've spent about the same\n\n219\n00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:13.500\namount of time typing up what I did as\ndoing the thing that I actually did.\n\n220\n00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:18.310\nSo I had double the work but\nit did put in a, and I used it greatly and\n\n221\n00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.460\nI got to the point where I said you know\nwhat without a work order I don't go\n\n222\n00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.140\nto the bathroom, you know, I'm not\ndoing anything without a work order.\n\n223\n00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.850\nBecause now I won't get in trouble.\n\n224\n00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.780\nI know that I followed\nthe correct procedure and\n\n225\n00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.920\nI did exactly what it is\nthat I was supposed to do.\n\n226\n00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.750\nAnd now I can never be held\naccountable if anything goes wrong.\n\n227\n00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.750\nSo again we go back to that\ndouble edged sword idea.\n\n228\n00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.440\nYeah it's a pain, but\nit can really help you out in a pinch.\n\n229\n00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.280\n>> And what Daniel's also\nexplaining it right is the idea of\n\n230\n00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.980\nfilling it out in the way\nthat they wanted it to.\n\n231\n00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.130\nIt leaves what we call\ntechnically an audit trail.\n\n232\n00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:54.700\nIf now anything that Daniel did is called\ninto question at this particular point,\n\n233\n00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.770\nwell what can happen,\nespecially in Daniel's situation,\n\n234\n00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:00.420\nis that they can go back and they can\nnow actually pull up that work order.\n\n235\n00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:04.550\nAnd what they can do is, somebody can say,\nwell, that wasn't done when I checked it.\n\n236\n00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:08.620\nThey can look and go no, according to\nDaniel's log here, according to that work\n\n237\n00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:13.730\norder, as soon as he finished it, he\nactually entered it in there at 12:35 PM.\n\n238\n00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.340\nOkay it's not that he entered it in seven\ndays later, it's not that he entered it in\n\n239\n00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:21.060\nafter the fact, or yesterday when\nyou actually called him on it.\n\n240\n00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.210\nHe entered it in exactly then and\nthat way they can tell.\n\n241\n00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:27.540\nAudit trails are very important,\nespecially in a large organization\n\n242\n00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:32.390\nthat does have a lot of internal auditing\nas well as external auditing going on and\n\n243\n00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:36.220\nwhen these things actually do have\nsomething that they have to watch out for.\n\n244\n00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.800\nSo, things like borrowing equipment is\nnot done in the way that we would like to\n\n245\n00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.700\nwhich is hey, just let me use that.\n\n246\n00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.610\nA lot of times there has to be\nthat requisition that shows that\n\n247\n00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.950\nthere is a transfer of authority\nfrom one location to another and\n\n248\n00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.010\nthat's because there's cost associated\nwith it, there's value associated with it.\n\n249\n00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:55.440\nThere's time in which that equipment\nhas to actually be accounted for and so\n\n250\n00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.810\nwe have to have things like audit trails.\n\n251\n00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.890\nThe other thing that we also have to do\nis the idea of what we call retention\n\n252\n00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.070\npolicies as well.\n\n253\n00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.080\nWhen you are actually\nworking on a project you\n\n254\n00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.640\nmight end up over your lifetime\nworking on very many projects.\n\n255\n00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.820\nBut you might also find\nyourself working for\n\n256\n00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:17.810\nan organization that says we retain these\nrecords and your work records here,\n\n257\n00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:21.580\nfor a certain number of years or\nmonths after the project is done.\n\n258\n00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:25.910\nSo they can go back and they can find\nthat information if they need to again.\n\n259\n00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.270\nIf warranty work needs to be done,\n\n260\n00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.030\nif anything else needs to be done,\nthey can find it.\n\n261\n00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:34.960\nIt's easy to think, cuz I remember doing\nthis when I first kind of lived on my\n\n262\n00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.790\nown essentially right after college, is\nI'll throw away everything and then first\n\n263\n00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:42.590\ntime I started doing that, I essentially\ngo, I shouldn't have thrown that away.\n\n264\n00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:45.860\nAnd I find out, and then I've just\nbecome a hoarder since I point instead,\n\n265\n00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:46.630\nno I'm joking.\n\n266\n00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.830\nIt's somewhere in between that.\n\n267\n00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.430\nBut you tend to actually retain things for\nso long.\n\n268\n00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.460\nAnd so you might find that your\norganization has a particular\n\n269\n00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.700\nretention policy and this is something\nyou have got to pay attention to.\n\n270\n00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:01.600\nThe idea of you just saying well,\nI won't worry about it.\n\n271\n00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.360\nAnd you throw that away when they come and\ndo an audit, right.\n\n272\n00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.520\nThey're gonna ask for those records.\n\n273\n00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.940\nAnd if those records aren't there,\nthat's when you're gonna have a problem.\n\n274\n00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.030\nSo make sure you know where you're\nretaining them, your particular records,\n\n275\n00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.670\nand make sure you know\nhow long the organization\n\n276\n00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:19.080\nexpects you to also retain\nthose records as well.\n\n277\n00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.840\nThe other one is the idea of\nwhat we call version control,\n\n278\n00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.150\nwhich is a big one for us, too.\n\n279\n00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.570\nWhenever you start looking at\nthis idea of version control,\n\n280\n00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:31.620\nwe know that our project may\nend up changing over time.\n\n281\n00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.060\nBut the problem that we have is simple.\n\n282\n00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:36.710\nIt's not that it changes over time,\nbut what did it change from and\n\n283\n00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:38.600\nwhat did it change to?\n\n284\n00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.180\nWe don't just simply need to actually\nknow that one day when we got up,\n\n285\n00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.888\nthat the project scope changed.\n\n286\n00:15:43.888 --> 00:15:48.787\nAnd the only thing that you could tell is\nthat it changed, but you don't know why,\n\n287\n00:15:48.787 --> 00:15:50.148\nyou don't know when.\n\n288\n00:15:50.148 --> 00:15:54.179\nSo there's always what we call version\ncontrol that essentially says Here was\n\n289\n00:15:54.179 --> 00:15:58.211\nthe project's original versionm here's\nwhat the revision versions are up in\n\n290\n00:15:58.211 --> 00:15:58.896\nthis point.\n\n291\n00:15:58.896 --> 00:16:02.556\nAnd that way you can increment and\nsee when these things have changed and\n\n292\n00:16:02.556 --> 00:16:04.738\nwhat has changed over that time.\n\n293\n00:16:04.738 --> 00:16:09.070\nJust saying in the project is now this\ninstead of this is no longer good enough.\n\n294\n00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.907\nWe need to maintain that\nhistorical record for\n\n295\n00:16:11.907 --> 00:16:16.705\nus, because our internal process says we\nneed to know why this project ended up\n\n296\n00:16:16.705 --> 00:16:20.217\ncosting us $50,000 more\nthan it originally did.\n\n297\n00:16:20.217 --> 00:16:23.226\nAnd when you know when that\nactually ended up happening, so\n\n298\n00:16:23.226 --> 00:16:27.271\nthey can use that as historical data for\nnew projects that come on board as well.\n\n299\n00:16:27.271 --> 00:16:30.623\nSo just kinda realize that there's\nalso those internal process\n\n300\n00:16:30.623 --> 00:16:33.488\ncompliance things that we\nhave to worry about as well.\n\n301\n00:16:33.488 --> 00:16:38.159\nSo we have Standards Compliance that are\na part of the organizational governance,\n\n302\n00:16:38.159 --> 00:16:40.428\nwe have Internal Process Compliance and\n\n303\n00:16:40.428 --> 00:16:43.580\nthen we of course have what\nwe call Decision Oversight.\n\n304\n00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:48.467\nDecision Oversight for us means that\nthe project manager is not an all\n\n305\n00:16:48.467 --> 00:16:51.594\npowerful omnipotent being on the project.\n\n306\n00:16:51.594 --> 00:16:53.313\nI know it sounds fun, okay?\n\n307\n00:16:53.313 --> 00:16:55.147\nBut it's not, okay?\n\n308\n00:16:55.147 --> 00:17:00.108\nHe has to have some oversight and a lot\nof times those recite decisions come from\n\n309\n00:17:00.108 --> 00:17:04.693\nthe people that are really actually\nthe sponsors, the stakeholders and\n\n310\n00:17:04.693 --> 00:17:09.984\nthat organization that has given him the\nauthority to manage that project as well.\n\n311\n00:17:09.984 --> 00:17:14.271\nSo, when there are things that the project\nmanager can directly change but\n\n312\n00:17:14.271 --> 00:17:17.741\nshould actually let the entire\norganization know about it,\n\n313\n00:17:17.741 --> 00:17:21.844\nwe normally have what we call decision\noversights that need to be done.\n\n314\n00:17:21.844 --> 00:17:25.714\nAnd normally in this particular one this\nis probably one of the most detailed\n\n315\n00:17:25.714 --> 00:17:27.829\nprocesses that we can\nspend our time in and\n\n316\n00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:31.648\nthat has to do with what we call change\nmanagement more than anything else.\n\n317\n00:17:31.648 --> 00:17:35.224\nIf you wanna know about a great\nexample of organizational governance.\n\n318\n00:17:35.224 --> 00:17:39.532\nIt might be that the entire organization\nsays, here is how we manage change and\n\n319\n00:17:39.532 --> 00:17:43.906\nour projects will also go through that\nsame particular process to ensure that we\n\n320\n00:17:43.906 --> 00:17:48.477\nunderstand what the changes are, and the\nchanges are actually done in a way that's\n\n321\n00:17:48.477 --> 00:17:52.034\nnot gonna affect the overall\nfunctioning of the organization.\n\n322\n00:17:52.034 --> 00:17:54.129\nNor is it gonna be harmful\nto human beings, nor\n\n323\n00:17:54.129 --> 00:17:55.651\nis it gonna be doing this or that.\n\n324\n00:17:55.651 --> 00:18:00.416\nBut we have to have some type of oversight\nin the decision making that needs to go on\n\n325\n00:18:00.416 --> 00:18:02.184\nwhen you start taking a look.\n\n326\n00:18:02.184 --> 00:18:06.501\nSo when you start seeing stuff like that,\nit really is to ensure that\n\n327\n00:18:06.501 --> 00:18:11.141\nthe project manager doesn't just\nbecome a dictator on his own project.\n\n328\n00:18:11.141 --> 00:18:12.650\n>> Yeah, as much as they would\nlove to do that, I'm sure.\n\n329\n00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean, who wouldn't?\n\n330\n00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.370\nLet's be honest, right?\n\n331\n00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:19.130\nYou feel like, this is my project,\nI'm gonna run it to where I wanna run it,\n\n332\n00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:22.070\nbut we have to,\nthat never really works out.\n\n333\n00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.187\nI mean, look at the large scale, right?.\n\n334\n00:18:23.187 --> 00:18:26.043\nDictatorships usually aren't\nthe best type of governance systems.\n\n335\n00:18:26.043 --> 00:18:28.344\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because it all comes down to\n\n336\n00:18:28.344 --> 00:18:32.681\nthe decisions of one person, and\nthey can be highly emotionally driven, or\n\n337\n00:18:32.681 --> 00:18:34.194\nidealistically driven.\n\n338\n00:18:34.194 --> 00:18:37.535\nAnd if thee's any deviation,\nthey just get rid of that person and\n\n339\n00:18:37.535 --> 00:18:39.374\nbring in someone that believes in.\n\n340\n00:18:39.374 --> 00:18:44.027\nIt's never a good idea, I've always said\nI never want, if I'm a project manager,\n\n341\n00:18:44.027 --> 00:18:46.190\nI don't want a group of yes men.\n\n342\n00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:50.340\nI want people to say yes to the right\nthings and no to the wrong things.\n\n343\n00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.007\nAnd that's the type of,\nand you need that, and\n\n344\n00:18:52.007 --> 00:18:54.885\nthat's what we're talking about here is\nhaving that governance, you got people\n\n345\n00:18:54.885 --> 00:18:57.660\nthat are over you that are watching\nwhat's going on and going, you know what?\n\n346\n00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.880\nI see what you're doing there but I think\nthis is gonna be the better way to go.\n\n347\n00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:04.490\nSo you need to listen to all the guidance\nthat everyone around you that's a part of\n\n348\n00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:09.030\nthe project, that's going to have, and\nthere are those that have the ability,\n\n349\n00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.270\nlike I was telling in my anecdote, right?\n\n350\n00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:13.140\nWho was watching my change, right?\n\n351\n00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:13.980\nMy boss wasn't.\n\n352\n00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:18.940\nIt was his boss that was going,\nwhy isn't Daniel doing this correctly and\n\n353\n00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.280\nnow he had to pull me in and\n\n354\n00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.650\nsay, here's where you're not doing this\ncorrectly and then we make that change.\n\n355\n00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.908\nSo there's always somebody over\nyou taking a look at things and\n\n356\n00:19:25.908 --> 00:19:27.835\nmaking sure everything's\ngetting done correctly.\n\n357\n00:19:27.835 --> 00:19:28.909\nRonnie, that being said,\n\n358\n00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:31.721\nis there anything else that we need\nto know about the specific process?\n\n359\n00:19:31.721 --> 00:19:35.565\n>> There is one other thing that we need\nto actually be concerned about when we\n\n360\n00:19:35.565 --> 00:19:39.038\ntake a look at organizational\ngovernance according to CompTIA and\n\n361\n00:19:39.038 --> 00:19:41.220\nthat is what we call Phase Gate Approval.\n\n362\n00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.010\nSo let's go ahead and take a look\nat all four of these again here,\n\n363\n00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.040\nat least let me see if I\ncan zoom out a little bit.\n\n364\n00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:46.730\nThere we go.\n\n365\n00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:49.570\nOkay, so we have standards compliance,\nwhich we already talked about.\n\n366\n00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:51.620\nWe have the internal process compliant.\n\n367\n00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.030\nWe just mentioned decision\noversight as well.\n\n368\n00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:58.420\nAnd this last one right here,\nlet me make sure I can zoom in there,\n\n369\n00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:01.800\nPhase Gate Approval is\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n370\n00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.670\nThis particular terminology,\n\n371\n00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.050\nthis is the only place where\nI find it which is CompTIA.\n\n372\n00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.630\nA lot of other places\nyou may hear the terms,\n\n373\n00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.340\nlet me make sure I mention them correctly.\n\n374\n00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.800\nOkay, Toll Gate Approval,\nyou may hear that term.\n\n375\n00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:18.470\nYou may hear the idea of\nProject Phase Transition.\n\n376\n00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:21.271\nOr my favorite is Go,\nNo-Go decisions, right?\n\n377\n00:20:21.271 --> 00:20:25.318\nSo remember that your project may actually\nproceed with the approval, right?\n\n378\n00:20:25.318 --> 00:20:29.839\nWith your project charter, you proceed\nessentially with the pre-project planning\n\n379\n00:20:29.839 --> 00:20:33.981\nand then you're actually now got the\ncharter, which gives you that authority\n\n380\n00:20:33.981 --> 00:20:38.081\nto move through that planning stage and\nthen of course even in the execution.\n\n381\n00:20:38.081 --> 00:20:41.596\nBut along with that,\nwhat also ends up happening to ensure\n\n382\n00:20:41.596 --> 00:20:44.478\nthat the project is not\ngoing to get out of hand.\n\n383\n00:20:44.478 --> 00:20:49.103\nIs that you may find yourself actually\nmarking the actual phases here, to say,\n\n384\n00:20:49.103 --> 00:20:53.659\nall right, at the end of the pre-project,\nin other words, the initiation,\n\n385\n00:20:53.659 --> 00:20:56.419\nif I can get the project charter,\nthat means for\n\n386\n00:20:56.419 --> 00:20:59.411\nme to able to move onto\nthe next phase of my project.\n\n387\n00:20:59.411 --> 00:21:03.296\nSo let's say that what we actually end\nup finding out is that a realistic\n\n388\n00:21:03.296 --> 00:21:04.604\nproject gate, right?\n\n389\n00:21:04.604 --> 00:21:09.587\nA phase gate here is that I can't\nget any sponsor to sign off on\n\n390\n00:21:09.587 --> 00:21:11.748\nthe pre-project setup.\n\n391\n00:21:11.748 --> 00:21:16.318\nIf I can't then that is definitely a no-go\ndecision, and that might not be mine,\n\n392\n00:21:16.318 --> 00:21:19.100\nthat might be the organization that says,\nlook,\n\n393\n00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.168\nyou've presented this\nproject as a project manager.\n\n394\n00:21:22.168 --> 00:21:24.464\nNow you need to get charter approval,\n\n395\n00:21:24.464 --> 00:21:28.934\nyou cannot find anybody that will sign\noff on this that this is a good idea.\n\n396\n00:21:28.934 --> 00:21:31.478\nSo, if you can't that's\ndefinitely a no-go.\n\n397\n00:21:31.478 --> 00:21:35.388\nBut, let's say we get through that\nprocess and we've now done our planning.\n\n398\n00:21:35.388 --> 00:21:39.339\nAnd even after the examination,\nthe planning and bringing it together with\n\n399\n00:21:39.339 --> 00:21:43.229\nstakeholders, we might actually go\nahead and now with the organization,\n\n400\n00:21:43.229 --> 00:21:46.461\nwith the stakeholder,\nwith the project management office.\n\n401\n00:21:46.461 --> 00:21:51.017\nWe might look at it and go, this was a lot\nmore complicated than we believed that it\n\n402\n00:21:51.017 --> 00:21:55.113\nwould be and we need to make a decision\nnow before we spend any more money.\n\n403\n00:21:55.113 --> 00:21:57.993\nWe've already spent this much\non just the planning phase,\n\n404\n00:21:57.993 --> 00:22:01.174\nbefore we spend any more money\nthat we are gonna continue onward.\n\n405\n00:22:01.174 --> 00:22:03.840\nAnd it might be a vote,\nbut it might be, again,\n\n406\n00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:08.243\njust decisions that are made based on what\nwe thought the time period might be or\n\n407\n00:22:08.243 --> 00:22:10.950\ncan it actually fit into the schedule.\n\n408\n00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:11.960\nWe might find out something,\n\n409\n00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.265\nwhich is one of the heartbreakers\nthat end up happening.\n\n410\n00:22:14.265 --> 00:22:19.482\nIt's that organization, it says yes,\nthere is a go, no-go decision right now.\n\n411\n00:22:19.482 --> 00:22:24.220\nWe wanna say yes to it, but in the time\nthat you actually requested for\n\n412\n00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.960\nthis project to start, we've already\ngot five other projects going and\n\n413\n00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.980\nwe just can't afford to take\non another one right now.\n\n414\n00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.670\nIf you can put this off for\nsix months to a year, then we can do it.\n\n415\n00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:38.600\nWell, what if in six months to a year\nyou don't really know if you're gonna be\n\n416\n00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.920\na project manager right then or not.\n\n417\n00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:45.234\nI know even within organizations you might\nmove from being a project manager on one\n\n418\n00:22:45.234 --> 00:22:48.434\nparticular part of the company\nto another particular part.\n\n419\n00:22:48.434 --> 00:22:51.508\nYou might go, I don't know,\nin six months I really applu,\n\n420\n00:22:51.508 --> 00:22:55.462\nyou know that you might have applied\nto be a project manager somewhere else.\n\n421\n00:22:55.462 --> 00:22:58.997\nSo you might go, well,\nlet's just do a no-go right now and\n\n422\n00:22:58.997 --> 00:23:03.044\nthey can use the project plan later on and\nsee if they want to do this.\n\n423\n00:23:03.044 --> 00:23:05.831\nBut you gotta realize that those\nare things that may also happen.\n\n424\n00:23:05.831 --> 00:23:08.995\nSo a lot of times it's not up to\nthe project manager just to say,\n\n425\n00:23:08.995 --> 00:23:11.761\nI don't care how complicated it is,\nwe're gonna go.\n\n426\n00:23:11.761 --> 00:23:15.379\nSo these decisions on governance,\norganizational governance,\n\n427\n00:23:15.379 --> 00:23:19.705\nand I say this is out of the hands of the\nproject manager, he's got a vote in it but\n\n428\n00:23:19.705 --> 00:23:23.404\nwe all have to decide whether or\nnot we believe it's gonna proceed.\n\n429\n00:23:23.404 --> 00:23:25.116\nAnd even in the execution phase,\n\n430\n00:23:25.116 --> 00:23:29.090\nwe may find out that we may go and say\nhere's how we know we're gonna proceed,\n\n431\n00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:33.154\ndid we produce the original prototype,\nif that's what we're doing, okay?\n\n432\n00:23:33.154 --> 00:23:36.802\nIn the first eight weeks like we\nsaid we're gonna do, if we don't,\n\n433\n00:23:36.802 --> 00:23:38.082\nwe come to a milestone.\n\n434\n00:23:38.082 --> 00:23:42.747\nAnd at that point, we may say, let's go\nahead and do a go-no go decision here,\n\n435\n00:23:42.747 --> 00:23:45.271\nafter looking at that product prototype.\n\n436\n00:23:45.271 --> 00:23:48.993\nIf the prototype doesn't exist,\nit's a no-go and we cancel it and\n\n437\n00:23:48.993 --> 00:23:51.094\nwe start all over at some other point.\n\n438\n00:23:51.094 --> 00:23:54.952\nSo, you may find that out, that there\nmaybe a ready procedures in place\n\n439\n00:23:54.952 --> 00:23:57.921\nto do that,\nbecause the organization has set that up.\n\n440\n00:23:57.921 --> 00:24:02.123\nOr in maybe a meeting, something, like\nmaybe even in the change management board,\n\n441\n00:24:02.123 --> 00:24:06.344\nor whoever your project sponsor is and\nyour stakeholders, and they come together.\n\n442\n00:24:06.344 --> 00:24:09.171\nAnd they say look, this is what it is,\nyou can't have it.\n\n443\n00:24:09.171 --> 00:24:13.467\nBut you do need to actually understand\nthat usually the decision to proceed on\n\n444\n00:24:13.467 --> 00:24:16.454\nwith the project is not in\nthe project manager alone.\n\n445\n00:24:16.454 --> 00:24:21.109\nIt does come from the organizational\ngovernance that has to also happen\n\n446\n00:24:21.109 --> 00:24:25.231\nas oversight for the project and\nthe project manager himself.\n\n447\n00:24:25.231 --> 00:24:29.666\n>> Well, Ronnie you've done a great job of\nexplaining why organizational governance\n\n448\n00:24:29.666 --> 00:24:31.488\nmight be a bit of a hindrance to us.\n\n449\n00:24:31.488 --> 00:24:35.231\nBut it is also usually\na very necessary hindrance.\n\n450\n00:24:35.231 --> 00:24:37.294\nIt's good for us, and\nwe need it, and we rely on it.\n\n451\n00:24:37.294 --> 00:24:40.158\nIt helps things move in the way that\nwe need them to move so that we are A,\n\n452\n00:24:40.158 --> 00:24:40.887\nCompliant and B,\n\n453\n00:24:40.887 --> 00:24:43.817\nthat people aren't just doing whatever\nthe heck they feel like doing.\n\n454\n00:24:43.817 --> 00:24:45.903\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They're following some sort\n\n455\n00:24:45.903 --> 00:24:49.883\nof structured procedure to verify that\nthose things are being done in that way.\n\n456\n00:24:49.883 --> 00:24:53.846\nThanks again, Ronnie, for stopping by and\nlending your expertise on this topic,\n\n457\n00:24:53.846 --> 00:24:55.165\nwe appreciate that.\n\n458\n00:24:55.165 --> 00:24:56.765\nWe also appreciate you guys watching.\n\n459\n00:24:56.765 --> 00:24:59.825\nI hope you got a lot out of this and\nlearned something, and for\n\n460\n00:24:59.825 --> 00:25:01.845\nour budding young project managers.\n\n461\n00:25:01.845 --> 00:25:03.705\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n462\n00:25:03.705 --> 00:25:05.495\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n463\n00:25:05.495 --> 00:25:06.315\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n464\n00:25:06.315 --> 00:25:07.990\n>> And we'll

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.830\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.100\nAnd in today's episode, well we will\ncontinue on our series Project+.\n\n5\n00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.620\nJoining us back in the studio\nagain today to lend his\n\n6\n00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.070\nexpertise on that very topic is our\ngood friend and mentor Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.350\nRonnie, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n8\n00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.980\n>> Well, thank you for\n\n9\n00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.490\nhaving me as we continue on taking\na look at Comptia's Project+.\n\n10\n00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.790\nWe're in that execution phase, where now,\n\n11\n00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.890\nwhat we're doing is we're taking\nthe components of our project plan, and\n\n12\n00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.630\nnow we're having to manage our project\nwith the overall project plan itself.\n\n13\n00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.030\nNow remember that if we were talking\nabout the idea of the project plan,\n\n14\n00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.350\na lot of times it's easy if you\nhaven't actually seen this before,\n\n15\n00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.930\nto not realize that it's actually made\nof multiple different components.\n\n16\n00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.380\nIn other words, small little plans that\nwe've taken the time to actually sit down\n\n17\n00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.280\nand work out the details behind, and\nnow we're actually taking all that, right?\n\n18\n00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.460\nAs our project is now actually\nbeginning it's execution,\n\n19\n00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.160\nthat we now need to take those plans and\nbegin to implement them and manage them.\n\n20\n00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.800\nRemember that this is not about doing\nall of the work that's actually\n\n21\n00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.760\nin the project.\n\n22\n00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.400\nIt's about how do we manage\nwhat is actually going on and\n\n23\n00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.270\nwhat do we actually need to make\nsure that we can manage that.\n\n24\n00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.330\nAnd so with all of that, right, there's\na bunch of different components then\n\n25\n00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.150\nthat you and I essentially are going\nto be monitoring and controlling with.\n\n26\n00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.560\nIn other words, we're going to\nbe updating the project plan.\n\n27\n00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.710\nWe're gonna actually see these\ndifferent components that are actually\n\n28\n00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.930\nhaving to be kept up to date.\n\n29\n00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.710\nAnd in that way,\nwe also need to make analysis of that.\n\n30\n00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.530\nTo see what actions need to take\nplace from that point as well.\n\n31\n00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.150\nSo in today that's what we're going to do\nis, we're gonna look at multiple scenarios\n\n32\n00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.890\nand then what component does that\nactually make us update, or have to\n\n33\n00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.790\nkind of manipulate, and then what actions\nare we actually doing when we do so.\n\n34\n00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.300\nAnd that way we would\nactually merge them together.\n\n35\n00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.820\nAbout what components are done and\n\n36\n00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.880\nwhat actions when we do encounter\na scenario what is it that we're doing.\n\n37\n00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.370\nSo what we're taking a look\nat is kind of a mouthful here\n\n38\n00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.895\nwich is\nProject Management Plan Management.\n\n39\n00:02:13.895 --> 00:02:16.270\n[LAUGH] I know that sounds strange.\n\n40\n00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.330\nBut it is.\nIt's about managing the project\n\n41\n00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.170\nplan itself,\nknowing what components go in what.\n\n42\n00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.880\nWe're gonna take a look at five separate\nscenarios here and components, and then\n\n43\n00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.640\nactions as well that we wanna take when we\nstart to take a look at this idea, okay?\n\n44\n00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.920\nSo let's go ahead and begin and\ntake a look at some of them that we have.\n\n45\n00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.900\nNow you actually find this inside of the\nCompTIA Project Plus exam objectives, so\n\n46\n00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.240\nif you're wondering where these scenarios\ncame from, these particular scenarios\n\n47\n00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.740\nactually came from my head but the actual\ncomponents that we're updating and\n\n48\n00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.220\nthe actions here are actually\nfound in those objectives,\n\n49\n00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.650\nso that's what we needed to take a look\nat when you do get ready for the exam.\n\n50\n00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.700\nA lot of times you're gonna see that\nthat's what's gonna happen on the exam,\n\n51\n00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.470\nis you're gonna be given a scenario,\nand they're gonna ask about hey,\n\n52\n00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.930\nwhich component might you need to\nupdate or you might to change,\n\n53\n00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.100\nyou might need to register.\n\n54\n00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.090\nYou might need to add in,\nyou might need to remove.\n\n55\n00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.800\nWhatever it might be, okay?\n\n56\n00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.410\nAnd then what type of action\nare you doing here, okay?\n\n57\n00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.930\nSo when we start taking a look at the risk\nregister itself, okay, what we want\n\n58\n00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.840\nto actually be able to do is understand\nwhat the risk register did for us.\n\n59\n00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.240\nWhen we took a look at it in the planning\nphase, we talking about the idea that\n\n60\n00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.120\nthe risk register is our attempt\nto essentially go through.\n\n61\n00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.790\nAnd be able to identify every risk\nthat can happen to our project.\n\n62\n00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.490\nAnd a lot of times, along with that risk\nregister, we normally give it a rating.\n\n63\n00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.200\nWe also give it whoever's the responsible\nparty for managing that particular risk\n\n64\n00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.970\nand if we have what we call a risk\nmanagement plan, In which we say, hey.\n\n65\n00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.010\nIf the risk occurs, what do we have?\n\n66\n00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.860\nDo we have anything in place that's\ngonna help us to reduce that?\n\n67\n00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.900\nWell, we have that there, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.670\nSo when we are facing risk to our project,\nwe normally actually have a book\n\n69\n00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.720\nthat we've already considered all\nthe possible risks that are there.\n\n70\n00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.530\nOkay, so at this point what you're\ndoing then is when you actually start\n\n71\n00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.250\nrealizing that risk may be coming to your\nproject, is that that means you need to\n\n72\n00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.060\nbegin to go ahead and start managing\nyour risk in a little bit better way.\n\n73\n00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.600\nAnd a lot of that also then means that\nyou're gonna open up the risk management\n\n74\n00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.460\nplan and try and see which of these\ndid you think's actually going wrong.\n\n75\n00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.000\nNow does that mean that you can't run\ninto risks that are not in there?\n\n76\n00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.500\nNo, it doesn't mean that.\n\n77\n00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.040\nBut a lot of times, if you've taken the\ntime to actually develop a risk management\n\n78\n00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.720\nplan, and you've taken the considerate\ntime to ensure that you've\n\n79\n00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.490\ngiven it very much consideration and\nthought,\n\n80\n00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.220\nthe majority of the risk that you'll face\non your project should be listed there.\n\n81\n00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.820\nSo one scenarios that I thought about\nright is something that can happen very\n\n82\n00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.380\neasily to a small project.\n\n83\n00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.610\nLet's say that what you and\nI are doing here right?\n\n84\n00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.920\nIs that we need to bring up some servers,\nand\n\n85\n00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.930\nwe need to guarantee that those servers\nare gonna be up 24 hours a day,\n\n86\n00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.960\nseven days a week, no interruptions\nto the power as well okay?\n\n87\n00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.520\nAnd that I know something that when I say,\nhey this is something we've got to\n\n88\n00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.680\nactually make sure that ends up happening,\nwell, what's gonna happen?\n\n89\n00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.230\nWell, what I need to do is I need to go\nand find that inside of the risk register,\n\n90\n00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.210\nand I need to see who's actually\ngonna be responsible for\n\n91\n00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.340\nimplementing something like this.\n\n92\n00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.270\nSo then I actually look and\nI see who the responsible party is, and\n\n93\n00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.400\nlet's say it's Daniel again.\n\n94\n00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.430\nI know I've used Daniel just about\nin every example but he's here and-,\n\n95\n00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.440\n>> I'm standing right next to you.\n\n96\n00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.140\n>> That's right.\nAnd you're standing right next to me.\n\n97\n00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.530\nSo I might find that out and\nI go to Daniel and Daniel says well,\n\n98\n00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:43.350\nif we need 24/7 here, here's a couple\nof different things that we can do.\n\n99\n00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.610\nOne, we could go ahead and say,\n\n100\n00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.000\nlook the first thing is we need to get\nsome UPSs, uninterruptible power supplies.\n\n101\n00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.130\nAnd this will give us this\nability to ensure that if\n\n102\n00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.410\npower goes out we'll still have power.\n\n103\n00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.260\nYou know, but for\n\n104\n00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.130\nhow long, whatever it might be we\nhave to make those considerations.\n\n105\n00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.180\nDaniel may even say\nwell let's not do that,\n\n106\n00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.360\ninstead let's just move\neverything over to the cloud.\n\n107\n00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.200\nOkay, moving everything into a cloud\nenvironment means I don't have to worry\n\n108\n00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.670\nabout power, I just have to worry\nabout paying for that subscription and\n\n109\n00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.020\nthen we're up and over with, okay.\n\n110\n00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.030\nSo, we don't really have\nto worry about that but\n\n111\n00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.080\nwe do have to worry about managing\nthe risk, and we do need to worry about\n\n112\n00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.520\nwhere in the world do we find how we\nactually overcome this risk as well.\n\n113\n00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.980\nSo, when you think about\nthis idea of management,\n\n114\n00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.250\nright you don't actually move into\nthe scheduling type of plan here.\n\n115\n00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.900\nYou're gonna go directly to the risk\nregister to figure that out.\n\n116\n00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.550\nOr you're gonna to go to the entire\nmanagement, risk management plan and see\n\n117\n00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.590\nwhat components do you need to actually\nupdate and bring everything into place.\n\n118\n00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.260\nBut the key here is to consider that.\n\n119\n00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.620\nHere's the scenario, here's the element\nthat I need as she open up and\n\n120\n00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.580\neither figure out or I need to\nfill out and update if I need to.\n\n121\n00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.563\n>> Very cool, now we that there\nare certain things that go with other.\n\n122\n00:06:54.563 --> 00:06:58.228\nI forget the name of these things,\nthe risk register, right,\n\n123\n00:06:58.228 --> 00:07:00.900\nif there is a risk that\nis where you gonna go.\n\n124\n00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.330\nIt's gonna tell what\nyou need to know about.\n\n125\n00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.900\nManaging risk, and that's what we do we\nmanage the risk through that manager.\n\n126\n00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:08.990\nRyan what else can we do?\n\n127\n00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.480\n>> Well there's sometimes where\nlet's say that you end up\n\n128\n00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.480\nas a project manager in a company that is\nin the middle of a switch over, right?\n\n129\n00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.850\nSo as the project initially began that one\nof the things you had initially in your\n\n130\n00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:24.490\ncommunications plan, right,\nis that you would essentially end up using\n\n131\n00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:28.260\nwhatever the internal internet\nserver was for your organization.\n\n132\n00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.880\nYou'd also use the on premises email to\nessentially communicate with everybody\n\n133\n00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.390\nin your project.\n\n134\n00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.070\nOkay.\n\n135\n00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.350\nBut let's say that during that what you\ndidn't realize was that your entire\n\n136\n00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.700\ncompany was also updating to\nsome online service instead.\n\n137\n00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:47.070\nSomething like office 365 and\nthen their integrating that fully.\n\n138\n00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.648\nAnd what you have right now or\nsome people what, on the old system.\n\n139\n00:07:50.648 --> 00:07:55.085\nSome people on the new system and\nthat means almost impossible for\n\n140\n00:07:55.085 --> 00:07:59.128\nyou to have The direct communication\nthat you used to have.\n\n141\n00:07:59.128 --> 00:08:02.179\nWell, this is something we don't\nthink about, but the reality is\n\n142\n00:08:02.179 --> 00:08:06.570\nthat it's something we might have actually\nconsidered in our original project plan.\n\n143\n00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.000\nIn other words, what did we\nactually say was a contingency or\n\n144\n00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.470\na backup to that system?\n\n145\n00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.270\nThat if we couldn't email,\nwhat were we supposed to do?\n\n146\n00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:17.420\nIf we weren't able to actually\nput files on the intranet server.\n\n147\n00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.800\nWhat was our next step to\nbe able to do here, okay?\n\n148\n00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.970\nSo one of the things that should\nhave happened, right, is that we're\n\n149\n00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:28.840\nnow executing our project and now we\nstill need to get information out or we\n\n150\n00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.520\nneed to get reports coming in or whatever\nit might be and those systems are down.\n\n151\n00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.370\nWhat is it that we need\nto actually be able to do\n\n152\n00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.140\nto ensure that we can still\nget the information out there?\n\n153\n00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.350\nWell one of those components then if\nwe take a look on my screen here again.\n\n154\n00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:47.410\nIs the communication plan itself, right.\n\n155\n00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:52.030\nSo hopefully your communication plan\nhas actually set up here, here is your\n\n156\n00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.800\nprimary choice and where most people\nshould be able to find the information.\n\n157\n00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.110\nBut if that doesn't happen, in other words\nif the system is not working then the next\n\n158\n00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:04.380\nstep might be phone calls, might be email\nthat you might have on your hand here.\n\n159\n00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.140\nSo you need to make sure that you\ndo have something established then\n\n160\n00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.150\nthat enables you to still communicate,\nokay.\n\n161\n00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:15.200\nSo being able to actually think in that\nway and use your project plan to help you\n\n162\n00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.470\nto manage that is the key when\nyou don't have a system in place,\n\n163\n00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.150\nwhen you don't actually consider it,\nwell then you don't know.\n\n164\n00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.860\nAnd so what starts to happen?\n\n165\n00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.100\nSomebody brings out their phone and\nthey start texting one person.\n\n166\n00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.970\nAnother person goes ahead and calls over,\nand then relays a message orally.\n\n167\n00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.870\nA third person goes and\ntries has a conversation with everybody,\n\n168\n00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.490\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n169\n00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:37.660\nBut if it's like that,\n\n170\n00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:41.970\nright, what are the very chances that me\ndelivering that message to three people in\n\n171\n00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.590\nthe same room, that in their methods in\nthe way that they chose to do it instead\n\n172\n00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:50.330\nof what we actually agreed on, that three\ndifferent messages could be communicated?\n\n173\n00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.320\nVery possible here.\n\n174\n00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.230\nAnd that's why implementing this and\n\n175\n00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.010\nunderstanding that this should\nbe a part of your project plan,\n\n176\n00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.950\nif you haven't thought about\nit before your project begins.\n\n177\n00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.330\nYou need to actually have not\nonly your primary method, but\n\n178\n00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.400\nwhat is your backup method, and\nensure that that actually takes place.\n\n179\n00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.490\nSo that way everybody on your project\nteam knows if it didn't come through\n\n180\n00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:13.330\nthis method, then you may wanna hold off\nuntil you hear it in this way, okay?\n\n181\n00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:17.250\nSo it gives them a way to know what the\nformal type of communication is gonna be\n\n182\n00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:18.220\nthrough your project.\n\n183\n00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.030\n>> Now Ronnie, it sounds like what you're\nsaying is that all of these components\n\n184\n00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:26.490\nhere you need to be officially documented\ninside of the project plan itself and\n\n185\n00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.220\nthat way there is no confusion whatsoever.\n\n186\n00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.560\nIf I'm having a communications issue,\nno problem.\n\n187\n00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.900\nI go into my project plan,\nI look for the communications plan.\n\n188\n00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.620\nWhat is that?\n\n189\n00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.410\nWhat should I do in this scenario?\n\n190\n00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.749\nAll of that stuff is laid out there for\nme, so it's really gonna base,\n\n191\n00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.260\nyou figure out what to do based\non the scenario yourself and\n\n192\n00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.770\nthat's why you're giving us scenarios.\n\n193\n00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.020\n>> Right.\n>> So let's say, well,\n\n194\n00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.780\nif I'm having a problem with risk,\nthen I need to jump over and\n\n195\n00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.780\ncheck out my risk register.\n\n196\n00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:53.450\n>> Register.\n\n197\n00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:55.480\n>> That's gonna give me\nmy course of action.\n\n198\n00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.090\nWhat should I do in case\na risk situation comes up?\n\n199\n00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.950\nHere is a communications problem,\nall right, well, that's another component.\n\n200\n00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.710\nI need to check out that communications\nplan, see what that says.\n\n201\n00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:06.560\nHow should I act?\n\n202\n00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.210\nAnd it's gonna give me the actions I need.\n\n203\n00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.330\nWe're not just making this up willy nilly.\n\n204\n00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.670\nIt's actually a part of our project plan.\n\n205\n00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.010\n>> And that is the key,\n\n206\n00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:18.100\nthat it is a part of something in\nwhich we now have ready to go.\n\n207\n00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:23.200\nWhen you start making it up on the fly,\nunless you are really one of those gifted,\n\n208\n00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.430\ngangster rappers apparently,\nthat you can just rap freeform.\n\n209\n00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.170\nMost of the time we fall flat,\n\n210\n00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:33.580\nand the reason is not because we're not\ngifted in rapping, even though I'm not.\n\n211\n00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:37.840\nMost of the time, right, it's because we\nreally didn't have a plan in place that we\n\n212\n00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.700\nfilled out sufficiently, okay?\n\n213\n00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.140\nAnd that poor planning is\ngonna end up showing itself\n\n214\n00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.260\nin these scenarios that don't go exactly\nperfectly in the way that we believe that\n\n215\n00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.150\nthey would go when we said, yeah,\nI've got a communication plan in hand.\n\n216\n00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:52.420\nAnd what did we really mean?\n\n217\n00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.220\nI'll call somebody.\n\n218\n00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:57.030\nThat's what we really meant of I'll\nget a message to them somehow.\n\n219\n00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.710\nWhat is that somehow, right?\n\n220\n00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.920\nAnd what happens when that\nsomehow doesn't end up working?\n\n221\n00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.280\nHow do they know it really came from you?\n\n222\n00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.890\nAnd that is kind of the key.\n\n223\n00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:11.550\nWe want that project plan to really be\nthat sufficient as much as possible\n\n224\n00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:15.590\nto where, if they don't have the answer\nimmediately, that the project plan helps\n\n225\n00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:19.560\nyou out to be able to actually show\nthem that it can still be done.\n\n226\n00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.550\nWhen people work ad hoc you will end\nup getting strange results in ways that\n\n227\n00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.490\nyou're not exactly sure of.\n\n228\n00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.070\nAnd not necessarily something\nthat you want as well.\n\n229\n00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.920\nOkay, so things like that will\nhappen when things aren't perfect.\n\n230\n00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.270\nSpeaking of things not being perfect.\n\n231\n00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:38.390\nThe other scenario that we can also bring\nup, and I'm bringing up another type\n\n232\n00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:42.860\nof scenario that I can think of here,\nis that what you might find out.\n\n233\n00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.470\nLet's say that what you want to do\nis implement a wireless network\n\n234\n00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:48.330\nthroughout our entire campus.\n\n235\n00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.000\nAnd let's say that when we\nactually added it up that included\n\n236\n00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.388\nlet's say 50 wireless access points or\nwireless LAN controller, right?\n\n237\n00:12:55.388 --> 00:12:59.710\nAnd we wanted to make sure that people\ncould connect using certificates as well.\n\n238\n00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.850\nAnd that's a pretty big\nprocess in doing that.\n\n239\n00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:06.010\nAnd let's say that we submitted that\nproject before the end of the previous\n\n240\n00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:09.510\nschool year and it got approved at\nthe end of the previous school year.\n\n241\n00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:14.980\nWorks perfectly fine and we said we know\nthat we can get it done during the summer,\n\n242\n00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.200\nwhen there are no kids in the building,\nokay.\n\n243\n00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.720\nAt least that is what believed can happen.\n\n244\n00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.700\nSo what we might find out though\nis that even in the summer\n\n245\n00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.810\nthat when we thought there\nwouldn't be kids in the building.\n\n246\n00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.920\nThe school has been rented out\nto do camps, soccer camps,\n\n247\n00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.830\nand baseball camps and art camps and\n\n248\n00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:36.860\nyou know whatever is there and there's\nconstantly students in the building.\n\n249\n00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:41.260\nAnd now you find out something that\nnobody's lifted that requirement, okay?\n\n250\n00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:45.455\nNow you have an issue, that the same\nthing, the same project still has to come\n\n251\n00:13:45.455 --> 00:13:49.220\nback, still has to be finished\nbefore classes will begin.\n\n252\n00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.230\nBecause we can't be tearing\nthe ceiling tiles out you know,\n\n253\n00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.550\nputting up access points when kids\nare actually there in the classrooms or\n\n254\n00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.520\nin the hallways, we can't be doing that.\n\n255\n00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:02.020\nSo what happens at that point is that we\nneed to actually have that understood\n\n256\n00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.640\nthat there are things\nthat are happening here.\n\n257\n00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.710\nSo that issues log is something\nthat we should take a look\n\n258\n00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:11.340\nat as we begin some of the action\nphases as well, right?\n\n259\n00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:15.880\nThat are there any issues as I now go,\nokay I've ordered my 50 access points.\n\n260\n00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:20.360\nBefore I begin the installation, let me\ntake a look at what the issue log here,\n\n261\n00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.930\nand see is there anything that's going to\nhinder me as I start on this week in June.\n\n262\n00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.820\n>> So these are like generalized issues,\nnot something that would be specific,\n\n263\n00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:32.470\nlike we have with communications or we\nhad that was specifically a risk factor.\n\n264\n00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:36.045\nWe're talking about an unforeseen,\ncouldn't account for this.\n\n265\n00:14:36.045 --> 00:14:37.700\nI walked in the building and its flooded.\n\n266\n00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.580\nWell we don't see a flood register.\n\n267\n00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.250\nWe don't have that in our project plan.\n\n268\n00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.120\nThat's when issue\nmanagement comes into play.\n\n269\n00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.730\n>> It really doesn't,\nand like Daniel said.\n\n270\n00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:45.670\nYou can't account for everything.\n\n271\n00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:49.450\nBut you can think about some other things\nthat you might be able to account for.\n\n272\n00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.610\nWhich is the start of the school day,\nright?\n\n273\n00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:55.430\nThat you go, that was an issue and I don't\nknow why that one has slipped me now,\n\n274\n00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:56.830\nis that would happen.\n\n275\n00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.250\nAnd then you didn't actually\nremember that, yes,\n\n276\n00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.010\nduring the summer that there would be kids\nrunning around in the hallways because of\n\n277\n00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:05.770\nthese different camps that end up\ngoing on, whatever it might be, right?\n\n278\n00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:09.580\nSo you might actually have to deal with\nthat as well, so just realize that\n\n279\n00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:14.140\nthe issues log really does help you\nto deal in that particular situation.\n\n280\n00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.310\nFor us,\nwhen you start looking around, okay?\n\n281\n00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:21.270\nSo there are several different factors\nthat you do have to consider when you\n\n282\n00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:25.984\nstart taking a look at the idea of what\nyou have to actually affect as well.\n\n283\n00:15:27.215 --> 00:15:32.185\nAnother one that we can also think about\nhere is that we might find out something\n\n284\n00:15:32.185 --> 00:15:35.635\nelse here which actually requires\na change in our project and\n\n285\n00:15:35.635 --> 00:15:38.955\nthis is kind of the big one that we\ncan talk about here for a moment.\n\n286\n00:15:38.955 --> 00:15:42.340\nLet's say that that we actually figure\nout something, that after we installed\n\n287\n00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:45.845\neverything we realized that we essentially\nneed 20 more access points, okay?\n\n288\n00:15:45.845 --> 00:15:47.925\nMore than we originally planned.\n\n289\n00:15:47.925 --> 00:15:50.513\nAnd now we're starting\nto realize something,\n\n290\n00:15:50.513 --> 00:15:52.526\nthat that requires a bit more money.\n\n291\n00:15:52.526 --> 00:15:53.266\nOkay?\n\n292\n00:15:53.266 --> 00:15:57.445\nAnd we have to actually get those access\npoints there as quickly as possible so\n\n293\n00:15:57.445 --> 00:15:58.666\nthat we can go ahead and\n\n294\n00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:02.380\nget them in place if we want\nthe full campus coverage to go on.\n\n295\n00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.630\nIf not we essentially have to wait until\nthe next time that our buildings are gonna\n\n296\n00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.140\nbe just about as empty\nas we can have them.\n\n297\n00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.040\nSo what do you actually have to do?\n\n298\n00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.900\nWell, Daniel has a company credit card.\n\n299\n00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.720\nHe just what?\n\n300\n00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.140\nGoes out and\nsays let me just order 20 more.\n\n301\n00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.590\nAnd we'll just get them\ninstalled when we can.\n\n302\n00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:20.190\nRight?\n\n303\n00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:21.760\n>> Yeah.\nI'm sure that will fly like\n\n304\n00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:22.820\na lead balloon.\n\n305\n00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.280\nNo one is going to approve that.\n\n306\n00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.240\nThat's not going to be right.\n\n307\n00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.330\nRight?\nI have to go through the proper channels\n\n308\n00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:30.980\nto make sure everything is going\nthe way the procedures allow for me.\n\n309\n00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.300\nI just can't grab a company credit card\nand go, by the way, I grabbed a plasma for\n\n310\n00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.450\nmyself as well.\n\n311\n00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:38.820\nAnd that's why we do it this way,\nto make sure that every\n\n312\n00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:43.590\ngood thing that needs to be done for\nthe project is documented, approved and\n\n313\n00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.080\nset forth and I guess that's\nwhere you're going with this.\n\n314\n00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.490\nRight, Ronny?\nWas change management.\n\n315\n00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:48.090\n>> It really is.\n\n316\n00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.330\nIt's the idea of what we call\nthe change management and\n\n317\n00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:55.400\nthis is one the big processes that now\nbrings in more than just a project team.\n\n318\n00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:59.090\nWe have whoever's actually gonna be a part\nof the change management but also it means\n\n319\n00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:02.660\nthat Daniel has to fill out more forms\nthan he really cares about doing, and\n\n320\n00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.650\nthat again is also part of\nthe idea of management.\n\n321\n00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.120\nIt's not that I'm telling\nDaniel he can't do it, but\n\n322\n00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.440\nwhat I'm telling Daniel is that he\nhas to follow those procedures and\n\n323\n00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.880\nensures that he gets that issue now\nbefore the change management board.\n\n324\n00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:20.520\nAs soon as we can, so that we can go ahead\nand deal with it and get those access\n\n325\n00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:25.050\npoints ordered as quickly as we can,\nto get them up and ready to go as well.\n\n326\n00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.810\n>> Now Ronnie,\nreally quickly would this also follow or\n\n327\n00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:31.710\nfall under the issues scenario,\nlike an issues log?\n\n328\n00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:35.490\nThis is something we couldn't account for\nand now we're kinda behind the eight ball?\n\n329\n00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.210\n>> Yeah, in this way it would\nfall under the issues log,\n\n330\n00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.700\nin other words\n>> It wouldn't be something that we\n\n331\n00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:41.970\nwould go ahead and predetermine,\n\n332\n00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.880\nbut what we might do is that we might\nimplement, after we do the change.\n\n333\n00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.530\nIs that we actually now make\nan entry in the issues log to say\n\n334\n00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.580\nhere is what we also ended up finding out.\n\n335\n00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.220\nNot enough access points.\n\n336\n00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:53.920\nOkay?\n\n337\n00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.070\nAnd then the action from\nthere in the issues log was.\n\n338\n00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:01.490\n>> Let's make a change request\nto the overall project,\n\n339\n00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:03.230\nmake sure that we get those in hand.\n\n340\n00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.140\nSo even after the fact right,\nactually adding that in there,\n\n341\n00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:09.020\nmaking sure that it now becomes an issue,\nis for\n\n342\n00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.050\nhistorical posterity and\nrealizing that we didn't account for\n\n343\n00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:16.200\nsome of the things like under ordering the\nnumber of access points we might have had.\n\n344\n00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.790\nThat is a big issue that we should\nhave actually accounted for but\n\n345\n00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.640\nin the way the Ronnie did his math and\nthe coverage area for one reason or\n\n346\n00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:28.338\nanother he didn't account for lets say\nthe south wing of the entire campus.\n\n347\n00:18:28.338 --> 00:18:30.610\n[LAUGH]\n>> Ronnie.\n\n348\n00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:31.925\n>> Yeah so big issue.\n\n349\n00:18:31.925 --> 00:18:33.550\n>> Yeah they might have\na problem with that.\n\n350\n00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:37.140\nSo you got to realize that a lot\nof this is really that simple.\n\n351\n00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.030\nSo it sounds, like you're going man\nRonnie that makes logical sense.\n\n352\n00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:46.000\nA lot of project management does make\nlogical sense, but it requires you not to\n\n353\n00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.640\nbe micromanagement in terms of Ronnie\nwhat access points did you really order.\n\n354\n00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.640\nI don't care, right?\n\n355\n00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.450\nNow don't get me wrong\nthat might covered at some\n\n356\n00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:57.420\npoint inside of the project itself.\n\n357\n00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:01.030\nBut for me, the only thing I'm\nworried about is making sure that we\n\n358\n00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:05.240\nstarted the project and that we finished\nthe project on time within my budget and\n\n359\n00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.890\nwe actually get the courage\nthat we actually needed to.\n\n360\n00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:11.120\nWhich actually leads us to one of the last\none's that we're gonna talk about in\n\n361\n00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.500\nthis particular section.\n\n362\n00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:17.250\nWhich is the idea of quality metrics here,\nmanagement of the metrics And\n\n363\n00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:21.840\nwe install everything,\nit also means that we need to determine\n\n364\n00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.670\nhow do we test whether or\nnot it's sufficient.\n\n365\n00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:28.660\nGetting an access point up is not\nthe most difficult thing in the world.\n\n366\n00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:32.300\nBut now if Daniel pulls up his laptop and\n\n367\n00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.580\nhe only gets one bar and he's standing\nten feet away from the access point.\n\n368\n00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:41.510\nNot exactly an overwhelming [LAUGH]\ngigantic way that we can say that\n\n369\n00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.480\nwe implemented the wireless\naccess network that we needed.\n\n370\n00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.990\n>> Yeah, you technically\nimplemented the wireless network.\n\n371\n00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:52.850\nBut probably not in the way in which\nwas assumed by the project manager.\n\n372\n00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:56.910\nWhen I say I want a wireless network, I\nwant to actually be able to connect to it\n\n373\n00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:00.040\nand use it, not just have you\nstick it up and turn it on and\n\n374\n00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.480\nit's 10,000 feet away from\nwhere I actually need to be.\n\n375\n00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.180\nSo you gotta take those kinds\nof things into account.\n\n376\n00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.660\nSo not only are you performing\na certain action, so\n\n377\n00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:14.210\nmaybe the change request was grab 20\nmore access points and install them.\n\n378\n00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:14.710\nOkay.\n\n379\n00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:18.060\nWell, when they say installed,\nthen they mean in a way which is useable.\n\n380\n00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.860\nThere's a lot of implied things as well.\n\n381\n00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.340\nBut it goes back to\nwhat Ronnie was saying.\n\n382\n00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.080\nA lot of this is very logical,\nvery common sense and\n\n383\n00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.320\nshouldn't be that difficult to figure out.\n\n384\n00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.770\nIt shouldn't be, but the nice thing is,\n\n385\n00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.700\nlet's say that now we've got\neverything implemented, right?\n\n386\n00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.360\nSomebody on our project team\ndoes need to go ahead and\n\n387\n00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.990\ntest essentially the quality\nof that network.\n\n388\n00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.690\nThe problem that we have once again right\nthen and there is that somebody could say,\n\n389\n00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:43.210\nwell, I know I put it up correctly.\n\n390\n00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:46.620\nBut maybe they don't know\nhow to test the network out.\n\n391\n00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:51.140\nSo what we're actually doing is we now go\nback to the project management plan and\n\n392\n00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:55.250\ngo, where can I go to actually test\nout whether or not this is sufficient?\n\n393\n00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:58.280\nWell this is where we would move\ninto the quality management\n\n394\n00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.320\nmetrics is what we would do, right?\n\n395\n00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.930\nWhat is our testing procedure to verify\n\n396\n00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:07.390\nthat the access points are doing\nwhat we need them to do, okay?\n\n397\n00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:09.960\nSo inside of that plan we\nmay actually go ahead and\n\n398\n00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.250\nimplement testing and we may say\nthat there's a certain number of\n\n399\n00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:16.190\nconnections that should be able\nto be done on the axis point.\n\n400\n00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.100\nAnd this is the speeds that\nwe're expecting to get, and\n\n401\n00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.180\nthis is where you actually go.\n\n402\n00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:24.080\nSo when you start talking about\nmanaging the project quality itself,\n\n403\n00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.150\nokay, that's where you go into that\nidea of metrics and measurements.\n\n404\n00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:30.330\nAnd hopefully inside of your plan,\nthat's what you do,\n\n405\n00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:34.350\nis you've actually set it up and\nsaying here's what it's going to be.\n\n406\n00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:36.940\nYou may not have all the details but\nyou might, right?\n\n407\n00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.440\nDepending on who set it up.\n\n408\n00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:42.280\nThey may have gone ahead and actually\ngiven you an entire testing program, or\n\n409\n00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.000\nmaybe where you contract that out and\n\n410\n00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.550\nsay, hey we're just gonna get a couple\nof kids to come in and verify and\n\n411\n00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:52.220\nsee what it's like when they do what\nthey're supposed to be able to do here.\n\n412\n00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.510\nSo it gives you that ability to\nbe able to measure whether or\n\n413\n00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:59.950\nnot your project is actually doing what\nit's supposed to be doing as well.\n\n414\n00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:02.990\nSo understanding at least\nthose basic scenarios.\n\n415\n00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:05.890\nAnd realizing that it's\nmore than just saying,\n\n416\n00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.740\nI've got a project management\nplan that I worked out.\n\n417\n00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:10.860\nYou're now taking what?\n\n418\n00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.930\nYou're essentially saying here's\nthe scenarios that we have.\n\n419\n00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:18.450\nHere's these different components\nto our project management, okay.\n\n420\n00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.920\nAnd here's what I need to update\nas things are going along, or\n\n421\n00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.000\nhere's where I need to check if I\nneed more information about it.\n\n422\n00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.630\nThe good thing is, if you've taken\nthe time to actually do your\n\n423\n00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:29.330\nproject management plan,\nthis is what you're gonna find out.\n\n424\n00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:33.310\nIt's gonna give you more than sufficient\nanswers for the majority of what you deal\n\n425\n00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:36.310\nwith as far as just unusual things\nthat end up happening to others,\n\n426\n00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:39.230\nthings that are not exactly perfect\nthe way that you planned it out.\n\n427\n00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:42.890\nBut it normally at least gives you that\nidea that, hey, this is the next step and\n\n428\n00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:43.890\nit's not perfect.\n\n429\n00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:45.730\nHow do I manage that from that point?\n\n430\n00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.790\nThat's what these scenarios\nare supposed to help us to think about\n\n431\n00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.490\nis that idea that did I do it right.\n\n432\n00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:55.080\n>> Yeah, that quality management metric,\nthat's kind of actually a big one,\n\n433\n00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.080\nto be honest with you.\n\n434\n00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.100\nI used to work construction.\n\n435\n00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:02.080\nI did bridge building and if we didn't\nhave quality management metrics in place,\n\n436\n00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.000\nwell, I wouldn't say\nthat it would be safe for\n\n437\n00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.180\nyou to drive over any of\nthe bridges that I worked on.\n\n438\n00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.160\nBut we did, they did things\nlike when we poured concrete,\n\n439\n00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.450\nwill it be able to hold the vehicles\nthat are going to cross over it?\n\n440\n00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:13.040\nSo what did they do?\n\n441\n00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.420\nThey tested the quality of the concrete.\n\n442\n00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.050\nThey would pour a cylinder.\n\n443\n00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:20.460\nAnd then when it dried to a sufficient\namount of time they would take it to\n\n444\n00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.420\na testing facility and see how much\npounds of pressure it would take.\n\n445\n00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.650\nStick it in this really cool machine,\nactually, with that cylinder, and\n\n446\n00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:29.330\nit would just start to try to crush it and\nsee how many pounds of pressure.\n\n447\n00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:33.940\nAnd they have a certain level of quality\nthat they expected to see before they\n\n448\n00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:39.110\nwould approve any vehicular use\nof said area of the bridge.\n\n449\n00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:42.850\nNow, if it hit 5,000 pounds, they're gonna\nsay, okay, we have a bit of an issue.\n\n450\n00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:46.960\nThat concrete is not gonna work and\nwe need to either go back and take all\n\n451\n00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:51.800\nthat old concrete out and put new,\ngood concrete in, or hey, you know what?\n\n452\n00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:56.180\nYou hit that 10,000 or 20,000 pound\nlimit now that concrete is good to go,\n\n453\n00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.880\nyou can start putting vehicles on it.\n\n454\n00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.360\nSo a good thing to have is\ndefinitely quality management.\n\n455\n00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.910\nMake sure that those things are,\n\n456\n00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:06.140\nthey're working the way in which\nyou would hope that they would.\n\n457\n00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.840\nRonnie is there anything else we need\nto cover when it comes to this stuff?\n\n458\n00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.750\n>> Well, not as far as what\nwe just talked about, right?\n\n459\n00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.700\nDon't get me wrong, you know,\nwe could talk on these things in much\n\n460\n00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.290\nmore detail and continue to,\nto wax eloquent on a lot of this stuff.\n\n461\n00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:22.300\nBut overall, though, just realizing\nthat these are kind of the basic\n\n462\n00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.250\nscenarios that you're normally\nlooking at when you're talking about\n\n463\n00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:30.510\nwhat am I doing when I'm using my project\nplan to manage my project here, okay?\n\n464\n00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:32.100\nSo when you start seeing that, right, and\n\n465\n00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.900\nyou start implementing everything, okay,\nyou're gonna find out that a lot of times\n\n466\n00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.800\nthings will go exactly the way you\nplanned, hopefully that they will.\n\n467\n00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.410\nBut if they don't you need to know\nwhat component is going to be\n\n468\n00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:45.340\nyour source of information,\ngonna give you also your\n\n469\n00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.640\nplan of action to be able to\nimplement what you need to as well.\n\n470\n00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.860\nAnd then what you need to call on\nif changes need to be done as well.\n\n471\n00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:56.140\nAnd we still got several more to go over,\nbut we're gonna save that for a part two.\n\n472\n00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:57.570\nI thought trying to go over like ten or\n\n473\n00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:00.650\n15 of these In one episode\nwould be a little bit too much.\n\n474\n00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:02.145\n>> Like drinking from a fire hose.\n\n475\n00:25:02.145 --> 00:25:03.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's always fun.\n\n476\n00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:06.500\nThe information overload is never a good\nthing, so we're gonna give you these five,\n\n477\n00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.590\nlet you sit on them, stew on them,\nthink about them, learn about them.\n\n478\n00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:13.410\nGet them put in the old brain so\nthat you can pass that Project+ exam and\n\n479\n00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:15.930\nwe'll come back for\na part two and give you the rest.\n\n480\n00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:17.490\nSo, we'll see you then hopefully.\n\n481\n00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:20.370\nRonnie, thank you so much for\nstopping by and explaining these five.\n\n482\n00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.380\nWe look forward to seeing\nyou in the next episode.\n\n483\n00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.980\nAgain we thank you you guys for watching.\n\n484\n00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.570\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n485\n00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:27.400\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n486\n00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.000\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n487\n00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.199\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n488\n00:25:30.199 --> 00:25:36.712\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.486 --> 00:00:19.525\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode well,\n\n4\n00:00:19.525 --> 00:00:22.110\nwe're continuing on with\nour Project+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.570\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto lend his expertise on that very topic\n\n6\n00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.290\nis our mentor, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.560\nRonnie, welcome back to the show.\n\n8\n00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.390\n>> Well thanks for having me.\n\n9\n00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.110\nAs we continue on to take\na look at CompTIA's Project+\n\n10\n00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.690\nwe're still taking a look at some of the\ndifferent scenarios that we're going to\n\n11\n00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.670\nend up seeing our project plan coming on\nwhen we start talking about managing and\n\n12\n00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.660\nexecuting our particular project as well.\n\n13\n00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.900\nAnd what we're really looking at are just\nseveral different scenarios that we\n\n14\n00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.770\nneed to understand that, when we bring out\nour project plan we talked about managing,\n\n15\n00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.330\nwhat is it that's gonna be affected and\n\n16\n00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.510\nthen what actions are we really\ntaking when we do that as well.\n\n17\n00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.120\nSo the good thing is we've already\nlooked at several of them and\n\n18\n00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.100\nwe wanna just kind of finish up our round\nof some of the different ones that we\n\n19\n00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.500\nwant to actually make sure\nthat we understand as well.\n\n20\n00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.070\nSo one of the last things we\nlooked at at the end of our\n\n21\n00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.580\nprevious episode here was some of\nthe things that we have to worry about,\n\n22\n00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.020\nsuch as issues and change managements.\n\n23\n00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.780\nAnd what we're actually now doing,\nof course,\n\n24\n00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.380\nis moving on towards a little bit\nmore on our scheduling side as well.\n\n25\n00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.050\nSo we're just gonna pick right on up\nthere when we start to take a look.\n\n26\n00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.670\nSometimes what ends up happening is\nas we begin our project execution,\n\n27\n00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.030\nwe wanna be able to see if our project\nis actually, well, progressing.\n\n28\n00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.210\nIt's kind of strange that we\nthink about it in that way.\n\n29\n00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.320\nIt's easy.\nYou go well,\n\n30\n00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.340\nI know if people are working on the\nproject, that it's actually progressing.\n\n31\n00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.800\nBut as a project manager you\nreally do not know that.\n\n32\n00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.080\nAnd the reason why you don't know\nthat is because nobody's actually\n\n33\n00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.490\nreporting to you.\n\n34\n00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.450\nIn this sense, let's say that you're\nworking in the same building with your\n\n35\n00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.410\nproject as the actual functional\nteams are working as well.\n\n36\n00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.510\nWell how do you know that those people\nare actually on your project and\n\n37\n00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.080\ndoing the work of your\nproject versus the work of\n\n38\n00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.260\nwhat actually is going on\ninside of the building as well?\n\n39\n00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.110\nAnd the reason why you don't know it\nis cuz you can't tell just by watching\n\n40\n00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.660\nsomebody work whether or\nnot they're doing that.\n\n41\n00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.490\nSo a lot of times that you have\nto do this as a project manager,\n\n42\n00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.170\nthough, is to essentially go ahead and\nstart scheduling meetings.\n\n43\n00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.590\nNow, I don't like meetings if I\ndon't have to be in meetings and\n\n44\n00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.340\nthe reason why is that there's\nusually not a lot that gets\n\n45\n00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.740\naccomplished in the meetings\nthat you go to.\n\n46\n00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.440\nIt's usually most people expressing,\nyeah, here's stuff that needs to be done.\n\n47\n00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.390\nWell, who's gonna do it?\n\n48\n00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.240\nI don't know, but it needs to be done.\n\n49\n00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.220\nBut in project management, though,\nmeetings are very important.\n\n50\n00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.820\nAnd things like project\nstatus meetings are of\n\n51\n00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.830\nutmost important to the project manager.\n\n52\n00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.640\nAnd they're important to the project\nmanager because, without those,\n\n53\n00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.150\nhe cannot be able to tell if the project\nis making any progress at all, okay.\n\n54\n00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.588\nSo meetings or scheduled meetings are very\nimportant to the project manager.\n\n55\n00:03:00.588 --> 00:03:03.160\nIf you're like me and\nyou don't really like to attend meetings,\n\n56\n00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.820\nyou try to push meetings off into\nthe last possible issue and thing.\n\n57\n00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.340\nAnd what you're doing at that point,\nright, is you're making the assumption\n\n58\n00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.880\nthat as long as you feel like work is\ngoing on, that it's really going on.\n\n59\n00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.320\nBut the problem that you have as a project\nmanager is that you are limited by those\n\n60\n00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.880\nconstraints of time,\nof cost, right, money, and\n\n61\n00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.450\nof the requirement or the project scope.\n\n62\n00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.740\nAnd you cannot do that,\nas far as a manager goes,\n\n63\n00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.580\nif you don't have any information.\n\n64\n00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.620\nAnd your main source of information is\nnormally gonna be through these meetings\n\n65\n00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.420\nwith people.\n\n66\n00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.280\n>> That's right.\n\n67\n00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.160\nAs fun as meetings tend to be,\nthey are a great way to assess whether or\n\n68\n00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.449\nnot everybody is on schedule and\nmoving on their task.\n\n69\n00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:50.255\nJust like Ronnie said, you can't kind of\ntake a bird's eye view of your people and\n\n70\n00:03:50.255 --> 00:03:54.700\nof your team and say they seem to be\nworking, because, one of my favorite\n\n71\n00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.545\nthings I've always heard is,\nif you want to look busy, look annoyed.\n\n72\n00:03:57.545 --> 00:03:59.950\n>> [LAUGH] So\nyou just sit around going, Hmm.\n\n73\n00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.570\nYou think, man, Daniel's working.\n\n74\n00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.370\nHe is really working.\n\n75\n00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:05.490\nI'm playing Free Cell.\n\n76\n00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.670\nThey don't know that.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n77\n00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.631\n>> I'm not winning, right?\n\n78\n00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:11.750\nYou don't know what's going on, so\nyou call a meeting and you say,\n\n79\n00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.560\nokay, Ronnie how are things progressing?\n\n80\n00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.150\nHow much progress have you made?\n\n81\n00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.420\nDo you think you're going\nto hit the time budget?\n\n82\n00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.860\nIs everything moving accordingly and\nlet's see where you at and\n\n83\n00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.090\nthen you can assess if the time\nis being managed properly.\n\n84\n00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.821\nIf not, I'm gonna say Ronnie, you're kinda\nslacking, you need to tighten things up,\n\n85\n00:04:28.821 --> 00:04:29.781\nmake sure you move on.\n\n86\n00:04:29.781 --> 00:04:33.124\nYou're gonna have to play a little catch\nup because you're behind on schedule but\n\n87\n00:04:33.124 --> 00:04:34.976\nonce you do,\nlet's stay on pace after that.\n\n88\n00:04:34.976 --> 00:04:37.435\nAnd that's the only real\nway to get a gauge of that.\n\n89\n00:04:37.435 --> 00:04:40.415\nSo this is a really good way to do that.\n\n90\n00:04:40.415 --> 00:04:43.148\n>> It really is,\nonce you have these meetings, right,\n\n91\n00:04:43.148 --> 00:04:47.280\nyou can then update the project schedule\nto show whether or not the project in that\n\n92\n00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.190\nparticular action or those actions\nare really progressing along.\n\n93\n00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.980\nWithout those meetings,\nyou're just making those assumptions and\n\n94\n00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.980\nit's just not going to help you out.\n\n95\n00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.900\nSo when you start seeing that, when you\nstart realizing that you need more and\n\n96\n00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.701\nmore information, that's the time for\nyou to actually call meetings.\n\n97\n00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:08.250\nAnd if you're actually a great project\nmanager, you'll schedule these meetings\n\n98\n00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.310\nin a regular and very periodic basis so\nthat people can update you.\n\n99\n00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.735\nThere's gonna be times in which\nthose people that are working,\n\n100\n00:05:14.735 --> 00:05:17.880\nthey're gonna say I don't really have\nan update except that we're working.\n\n101\n00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.920\nAnd what you need to tell them, right,\n\n102\n00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.120\nis that you need to find out if they can't\nreport to you like how it's progressing,\n\n103\n00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.090\nat least how much work\nhas been accomplished.\n\n104\n00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.690\nAnd you might actually ask for\nthis in terms of work hours,\n\n105\n00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.520\nif you need to, or the amount of resources\nthat they've consumed on their project.\n\n106\n00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.630\nThat means that what they can do, and\nhopefully that's what they're also\n\n107\n00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.136\nmonitoring, is that it means you're\nnot requiring any analysis of them,\n\n108\n00:05:42.136 --> 00:05:47.360\nof whether they're 55% complete with it or\n60 or 65%, right?\n\n109\n00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.592\nWhen somebody normally asks that,\n\n110\n00:05:49.592 --> 00:05:51.642\nwell just give me a percentage\non how much you're complete.\n\n111\n00:05:51.642 --> 00:05:53.402\nA lot of times I don't know.\n\n112\n00:05:53.402 --> 00:05:59.300\nI generally just go it's either\ngonna be 25%, 50%, 75 or 100.\n\n113\n00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.870\nThat's my kinda standard operating,\nif I don't know.\n\n114\n00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.390\nBut a lot of times when people\nget pushed to their point\n\n115\n00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.950\nthey're gonna say I think I'm\nabout 60% complete on this.\n\n116\n00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.625\nAnd what they really mean is I think I'm\nhalfway through, but I don't really know,\n\n117\n00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:14.260\nbut to push them that.\n\n118\n00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.550\nBut if you can at least get work\nhours out of this right, and\n\n119\n00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.080\nthe number of days that they've already\nworked on it, you can go ahead and\n\n120\n00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.590\nstart doing some estimates, and we're\ngonna get into formulas in a later date.\n\n121\n00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.080\nBut you can actually at\nleast start working that.\n\n122\n00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.280\nAnd that way you can update the actual\nprogress on your project schedule and\n\n123\n00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.450\nknow whether or not you do need\nto assign more resources or\n\n124\n00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.090\nnot to actually figure this out.\n\n125\n00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.840\nSo using those scheduled\nmeetings is a big part.\n\n126\n00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.660\nMaking sure your project\nschedule is also up to date.\n\n127\n00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.805\nIs gonna give you\na graphical representation,\n\n128\n00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:49.410\nis gonna allow your stakeholder to\nknow there is progress on this too.\n\n129\n00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:55.470\nNow the other thing that we also need to\nbe able to tell, as a project manager,\n\n130\n00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:02.030\nis when our project may be lacking some\nof the resources that we have going on.\n\n131\n00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.540\nNow this is a little bit more difficult,\nright.\n\n132\n00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:05.810\nWork can progress.\n\n133\n00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.370\nAnd there are people that can\nactually work with very little.\n\n134\n00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.830\nThere's people that can't\nactually work with anything but\n\n135\n00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.080\neverything that can be done.\n\n136\n00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.680\nAnd I know people like that, right.\n\n137\n00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.961\nThere's sometimes where\nyou'll give somebody some,\n\n138\n00:07:16.961 --> 00:07:19.130\nand I wanna pull the MacGyver out here,\nright?\n\n139\n00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.290\nYou give them a paperclip.\n\n140\n00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.990\nYou give them some duct tape.\n\n141\n00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.253\nAnd they can work miracles.\n\n142\n00:07:23.253 --> 00:07:26.410\nBut then there's other\npeople that I know that,\n\n143\n00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:31.660\nman, they will not lift a finger,\nokay, until they feel like what?\n\n144\n00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:37.160\nEverything is in it's proper place and\nthey have every element on hand.\n\n145\n00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.660\nAnd then they'll pick everything up and\nthen they'll start working as well.\n\n146\n00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.640\nWell, both of those scenarios you know\ncan end up happening on a project.\n\n147\n00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.052\nBut what if your project\nis now progressing?\n\n148\n00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:53.090\nAnd yes, you actually do have multiple\nwork packages now actually working out.\n\n149\n00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:57.758\nBut how do you actually know when you have\none work package that may be suffering\n\n150\n00:07:57.758 --> 00:08:00.516\nwith a dearth of materials or\nconsumables, or\n\n151\n00:08:00.516 --> 00:08:04.548\neven another person in need And\nanother one has too much, okay, and\n\n152\n00:08:04.548 --> 00:08:08.470\nwhat are we taking a look at\nthere when we start seeing it?\n\n153\n00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.110\nWell what you're actually now looking for\nwhen you have something like that\n\n154\n00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:17.060\nis that you have to go beyond the idea\nof progress in your project here.\n\n155\n00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.940\nAnd you now have to actually\nstart to demand some\n\n156\n00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.660\nperformance data is what\nyou're looking for.\n\n157\n00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.565\nOkay, so even though we can ask for\n\n158\n00:08:24.565 --> 00:08:27.930\nperformance in terms of\ncompletion by percentage, right?\n\n159\n00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.380\nIn other words the idea of progress,\nbut what we're now looking for\n\n160\n00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.738\nis actual performance.\n\n161\n00:08:32.738 --> 00:08:36.020\nAnd even though I told you that on the\noriginally if you can't do anything else\n\n162\n00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.820\nat least get some performance here.\n\n163\n00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.370\nYou're actually gonna now take that\nperformance stuff and then try and\n\n164\n00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:46.130\nsee why one work package, right,\nmight be falling behind schedule and\n\n165\n00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:50.170\nyou might actually be able to find that\nout by taking a look at those hours and\n\n166\n00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.540\nseeing what materials I've\nactually been consumed.\n\n167\n00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.955\nAnd then you might go, man this is why,\n\n168\n00:08:54.955 --> 00:08:58.040\ncuz they don't have enough people working\non this and that's why they're falling\n\n169\n00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.630\nbehind While this other project\nhas three or four people.\n\n170\n00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:05.410\nAnd what we're realizing is\nthat they're progressing but\n\n171\n00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:07.700\nthe cost is actually insanely large.\n\n172\n00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.740\nAnd that means that there's not\nenough people working on that or\n\n173\n00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:12.530\ntoo many people on that one.\n\n174\n00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.690\nSo you might end up finding that out.\n\n175\n00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.850\nAnd when you start seeing that usually\nyou're gonna find that in the WBS itself,\n\n176\n00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.320\nthe work breakdown schedule structure for\nyou.\n\n177\n00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.960\nWhere you can take that one work package\nand see what resources have been assigned\n\n178\n00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.940\nand you do, you want to start demanding\nsome performance information or\n\n179\n00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.620\nreceiving, I should say,\nperformance information on that.\n\n180\n00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.930\nSo then you can take a look at\neach of those work packages and\n\n181\n00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:41.230\nthat way you can actually help out and\ngo, I'm gonna reassign this resource\n\n182\n00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:44.280\nto this work package to help out over\nhere cuz they definitely need more help.\n\n183\n00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.080\n>> Yeah Ronnie, we've said it once,\nwe've said it a thousand times.\n\n184\n00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.400\nWe're not clairvoyant.\n\n185\n00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.060\nWe're not omniscient.\n\n186\n00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.490\nThere's gonna be areas in which\nwe've probably made a guess in\n\n187\n00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:56.200\nhow much material do you need to create\nthis product in the time allotted?\n\n188\n00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.030\nWell I think it'll be about this.\n\n189\n00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:04.060\nWell if Ronnie's making cogs and he runs\nout of plastic to make his cogs with,\n\n190\n00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.390\nhe could be right on time, he could be\nright on pace, his schedule's not off.\n\n191\n00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.990\nAnd so he runs out of material,\nnow there's a problem.\n\n192\n00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:14.410\nWhat does Ronnie gotta do, he's gotta\nlet me know I need more plastic so\n\n193\n00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.440\nI can continue making cogs\nat the pace that I'm at,\n\n194\n00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.570\notherwise we're gonna have\na real major slow down.\n\n195\n00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.470\nSo it can be all about making sure that\neveryone has all the materials they need\n\n196\n00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.730\nor the resources they need,\nas in personnel.\n\n197\n00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.610\nMaybe like he said,\nmaybe they have too many.\n\n198\n00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:31.350\nMaybe we put too much resources on\nsomething and I go, you know what?\n\n199\n00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.960\nI'm gonna reclamate some\nof those resources.\n\n200\n00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.990\nI'm gonna continue to get\nthe performance I need and\n\n201\n00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.740\nI'm gonna find somewhere where\nthey're gonna be more productive.\n\n202\n00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.820\nMaybe they're having a trouble over\nin this area of the project, and\n\n203\n00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.560\nthey could use the extra help, put them\nover there, and this is how that's done.\n\n204\n00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.300\n>> It really is.\n\n205\n00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.190\nIt does help out when you\nstart getting the information.\n\n206\n00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.950\nAnd you're now starting to see a part of\nthe idea of managing the project right?\n\n207\n00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.870\nIt's not just about saying,\nI've got a plan and\n\n208\n00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:59.960\nwe're doing it, it really is about\nstaying on top of the data that you need\n\n209\n00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.550\nto ensure that progress is happening\nthe way that you need it to.\n\n210\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:07.130\nGetting the performance data that really\ndoes help to show that hey everything is\n\n211\n00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.480\nactually going well or\ndo I need to move some resources around to\n\n212\n00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.440\nmake things actually perform\na bit better as well.\n\n213\n00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.570\nSo you do need to do that or\nwhat's gonna end up happening, right,\n\n214\n00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:20.260\nat any point in time, is that you're\nnot gonna know exactly where your\n\n215\n00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.640\nproject is according to the schedule.\n\n216\n00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.560\nYou're not gonna know what you can\nactually do in terms of resources\n\n217\n00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.500\nto help put you back on the schedule\nthat you need as well, okay?\n\n218\n00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.310\nSo, so far what we've really talked about\nin the idea of scheduling, right, and\n\n219\n00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:38.340\nin the work breakdown packages,\nessentially goes to those elements that we\n\n220\n00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.220\ntalk about in terms of human\nresources a lot of times, right?\n\n221\n00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.500\nBeing able to get information and\n\n222\n00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.640\nperformance information\nnormally is that way, okay?\n\n223\n00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.990\nBut the other thing that we need\nto actually worry about too,\n\n224\n00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:53.540\nis the idea of money, right,\nthe cost of our project as well.\n\n225\n00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:58.080\nI can know that I have $250,000 for\nmy project.\n\n226\n00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.360\nBut one of the things I should know is\nwhere in the world that expense is going\n\n227\n00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.630\nto if I'm going to be using that $250,000.\n\n228\n00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:12.490\nIf Daniel were my project sponsor and\nhe gave me $250,000, I'm pretty sure that,\n\n229\n00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:16.930\nif I came back to Daniel and said,\nDaniel, I spent it on the project,\n\n230\n00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:21.450\nhe's gonna wanna know where in the world\ndid I spend it on that project?\n\n231\n00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:24.340\nAnd Daniel, that's one of the things\nthat we really have to track is\n\n232\n00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.990\nwhere in the world the money goes, right?\n\n233\n00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.320\n>> Yeah, and I guarantee, this is\nprobably getting the most scrutiny of\n\n234\n00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.070\nany of these topics that we have, of these\ncomponents that we've been talking about.\n\n235\n00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:36.500\nPeople that are lending out the money or\n\n236\n00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.080\nit's their money that's on the line,\nthey are watching this like a hawk.\n\n237\n00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.160\nThey wanna know where every cent goes.\n\n238\n00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.660\nBecause unfortunately it does happen,\n\n239\n00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.070\nI've been part of companies\nwhere I've seen it occur.\n\n240\n00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.470\nPeople like to steal, because they\nthink it's just a big pool of money.\n\n241\n00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.610\nI can just take some and\nno one will notice.\n\n242\n00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:53.910\nWell guess what?\n\n243\n00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:57.380\nSomeone's watching those dollars and\ncents and seeing where they're going.\n\n244\n00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:00.450\nAnd if they're taking a look at the budget\nand it's not lining up with what's\n\n245\n00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:04.230\nbeing spent, then there's gonna be a\nmeeting called with someone, right Ronnie?\n\n246\n00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:08.190\n>> There really is and that's something\nthat you do have to account for, right?\n\n247\n00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:12.440\nThe very fact is you may have the project\naccountant essentially send you\n\n248\n00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.440\nthe information that they know that\nthey're actually signing checks or\n\n249\n00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.720\nwhatever it is that money is going out.\n\n250\n00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.130\nAnd what they need to actually do is\nas you're going okay that's fine,\n\n251\n00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.080\nyou've got account of this.\n\n252\n00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.440\nBut the problem that you have is simple,\n\n253\n00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.560\nis you don't know where\nthe money is going.\n\n254\n00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.290\nSo what may happen at one particular point\nin time is that is that project accounted\n\n255\n00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:34.420\nwhen you when you say hey, or when they\nsend you something then tell you that hey,\n\n256\n00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.650\nthere's a check here that's written but\nit can't come out of this bigger\n\n257\n00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.660\nportion of the budget, and this is\nwhere you actually will get in trouble.\n\n258\n00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.040\nWhy, okay?\n\n259\n00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.930\nAnd they're saying well, you should\nknow why you can't spend any more here.\n\n260\n00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.430\nWell the reason that you should know is\nthat you're supposed to be able to track\n\n261\n00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:54.420\nwhere the money actually\nwas supposed to be sent.\n\n262\n00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.320\nIf you're not tracking where the money is,\nDaniel is right.\n\n263\n00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.420\nPeople could have pocketed the money or\nthe very fact is,\n\n264\n00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.240\nyou're kind of not doing\nyour job in saying,\n\n265\n00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:07.860\nthis is where the money is actually\nspent to account for that.\n\n266\n00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.340\nIf the meeting is called in the way\nthat Daniel's actually referring to,\n\n267\n00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:15.930\nthat's when you're gonna an audit\nthat ends up going on an ad hoc audit\n\n268\n00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:19.660\nat that point, and they may find out\nthat it's your accounting skills, or\n\n269\n00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.650\nyour management skills\nthat's not keeping track.\n\n270\n00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.170\nSo what you may need to do, right,\nis you need to take a look at that budget.\n\n271\n00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:28.870\nAnd because of the way that\nthe accountants set it up, right,\n\n272\n00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.800\nin which they give you account numbers.\n\n273\n00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.510\nYou now need to make sure that\nas people are submitting,\n\n274\n00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:39.020\nokay, their particular expenses,\nright, to you or\n\n275\n00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:43.300\nto the project accountant, that what\nthey need to be using here, okay,\n\n276\n00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:48.220\nis gonna be those accounting numbers\nthat will allow them then to track it.\n\n277\n00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:54.215\nIf somebody just hands, so let's say that\nI have from my phase of the project,\n\n278\n00:14:54.215 --> 00:14:57.310\n1,500 is my account number,\nDaniel's, though, is 1600.\n\n279\n00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:02.070\nIf all of a sudden I submit all mine and\nall my receipts have 1500 on everything,\n\n280\n00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:05.780\nDaniel submits 104 receipts and\ndoesn't have anything,\n\n281\n00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.990\nwell where does the accountant\nput that to actually credit that?\n\n282\n00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.970\nDoes he put it towards my budget?\n\n283\n00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:14.250\nAnd that drains what I have at least\nlisted in the accounting phase.\n\n284\n00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:18.440\nEven though the money isn't really gone,\nlist it as mine and\n\n285\n00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.730\nthen I go into a deficit on my side.\n\n286\n00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:24.240\nOr does Daniel actually need to do\na little bit of a better job at actually\n\n287\n00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.270\nensuring that as he submits these forms\nand whatever else needs to be done.\n\n288\n00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:32.850\nAnd every receipt that he submits in\nhe's using that accounting number.\n\n289\n00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.430\nAnd that helps you, then,\n\n290\n00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:38.030\nthat what you're doing is you're tracking\nthe same thing that they're tracking.\n\n291\n00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:41.450\nAnd that now actually allows you when\nDaniel says, hey I need another $2,000.\n\n292\n00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:46.159\nI can go to that budget to that 1,600 and\n\n293\n00:15:46.159 --> 00:15:50.210\ngo, well no, you actually ended up\ngetting a little bit more than you,\n\n294\n00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.960\naccording to this, you actually overspent\nwell, what if you don't know that.\n\n295\n00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.347\nYou don't know that Daniel's overspent.\n\n296\n00:15:55.347 --> 00:15:57.503\nYou might actually go,\nyeah let me go ahead and sign off on that.\n\n297\n00:15:57.503 --> 00:15:59.864\nHere's another 2,000 and go ahead with it.\n\n298\n00:15:59.864 --> 00:16:02.783\nThat can get you in trouble\njust as quickly as well.\n\n299\n00:16:02.783 --> 00:16:06.377\nSo keeping a track of that budget,\nespecially money, right?\n\n300\n00:16:06.377 --> 00:16:10.227\nThe bottom line always comes down\nto accounting for the money, so\n\n301\n00:16:10.227 --> 00:16:13.460\nthis is actually fairly\nserious at this point.\n\n302\n00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.790\nIt doesn't mean you have to\nactually be that accounted.\n\n303\n00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.440\nYou don't have to be CPA on your project,\nbut\n\n304\n00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.180\nit means you need at\nleast track the budget.\n\n305\n00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.270\nWhere are the expenses\nactually coming from,\n\n306\n00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:26.190\nso you know who to\nactually account them to.\n\n307\n00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:29.770\nAnd your project accountant will\nactually keep all the books to the very\n\n308\n00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.870\npenny that you have and\nyou don't have to worry about that.\n\n309\n00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.700\nBut if you don't know it's going to\nbe a bad line on you as a project\n\n310\n00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:40.460\nmanager instead, because you're saying,\nI know I have a certain amount of money,\n\n311\n00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.900\nbut I don't have a clue\nwhere the heck it goes and\n\n312\n00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:44.580\nthat's really kind of a bad light on you.\n\n313\n00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:48.590\n>> Yeah, poor money management will kill a\nproject faster than anything you can think\n\n314\n00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.560\nof just because all of a sudden\nthe resources are dried up and\n\n315\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.220\nyou don't have a complete project.\n\n316\n00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.540\nYou can go back to the well and\nhopefully there's more to be had, but\n\n317\n00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.530\nif there's not,\nwhat are you gonna do, right?\n\n318\n00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.420\nAnd we've seen that there\nis actually plenty of\n\n319\n00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.570\nprojects that you can use as example,\n\n320\n00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:07.920\none of them's the Road to Nowhere, I think\nit's out in West Virginia or Virginia.\n\n321\n00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.660\nBillions of dollars spent on this road and\nIt goes literally, nowhere,\n\n322\n00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.820\nit doesn't do anything.\n\n323\n00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:13.840\nThat's because they ran out of money.\n\n324\n00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.810\nThey didn't have a good money manager.\n\n325\n00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.835\nI think, Ronnie, I think you made the\nexample of some sort of tunnel somewhere.\n\n326\n00:17:19.835 --> 00:17:21.513\n[CROSSTALK] Not very useful right?\n\n327\n00:17:21.513 --> 00:17:25.770\n>> Yeah, well the big dig has been\naround for a ton of years, right?\n\n328\n00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.760\nIt was only supposed to be like a four\nyear project that's now gone on for\n\n329\n00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:30.240\nalmost 40 years.\n\n330\n00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.860\nSo it allows you to actually be\nable to see that projects that\n\n331\n00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.150\ndon't keep control of the budget,\nthey just end up exploding the budget.\n\n332\n00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.870\nAnd as long as the government's paying for\nit, most people normally don't care, but\n\n333\n00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:43.340\nthe reality is most of the projects\nyou and I end up working on.\n\n334\n00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.450\nIt's gonna be accounted for\nat some point in time.\n\n335\n00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.320\nThe reason why those don't get accounted\nfor is cuz they have to finish.\n\n336\n00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.190\nThey literally have to finish.\n\n337\n00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.370\nAnd they really actually have\nto keep it repaired now and\n\n338\n00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.370\nthey can't actually\nclose that project down.\n\n339\n00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:56.350\nNo matter what they say that they can do,\n\n340\n00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.710\nMassachusetts just can't\nafford to anymore.\n\n341\n00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.480\nSo you're actually starting\nto see that as well.\n\n342\n00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.930\nBut most of the time, right.\n\n343\n00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:05.780\nBecause you, as a project manager are\nsupposed to be able to keep track of this,\n\n344\n00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.580\nthat's what you have\nto be able to as well.\n\n345\n00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.162\nOkay.\nSo I little bit of money management\n\n346\n00:18:10.162 --> 00:18:11.670\nwill help you out.\n\n347\n00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:16.266\nNow, the other one is actually closely\ntied here with the idea of working with\n\n348\n00:18:16.266 --> 00:18:16.840\nthe WBS.\n\n349\n00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.570\nAnd which is what we call\nthe Idea Resource Requirements.\n\n350\n00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.500\nLet's take a look at my computer again.\n\n351\n00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.110\nOkay?\nSo\n\n352\n00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.730\nlet's say, you are the one that's\nactually assigned to a work package.\n\n353\n00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:30.190\nThe project manager has now asked for a\nprogress report and additional information\n\n354\n00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:34.200\nto see if anything else is required for\nyou to complete that work package.\n\n355\n00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.620\nSo what you might find out is that you're\nactually at the other end of this and\n\n356\n00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.280\nnot just as a project manager but\n\n357\n00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:45.270\nyou are actually now having to update\nthe Project Manager, because you\n\n358\n00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.730\nrealize something that there is something\nthat is missing in your work package.\n\n359\n00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:52.740\nThat as you went through the scope\nof the project, you realize that\n\n360\n00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.720\nwherever your work project ended, it did\nnot actually complete where it needed to.\n\n361\n00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.090\nBut the Project Manager\nneeds to know that.\n\n362\n00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.270\nThere are times that you as a team member,\nright?\n\n363\n00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.160\nCan go ahead and make a recommendation.\n\n364\n00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.640\nOkay, that’s else look,\n\n365\n00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.690\nwe need update this requirement\nin this work package here, okay.\n\n366\n00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:13.963\nAnd that particular updates\ngonna end up affecting,\n\n367\n00:19:13.963 --> 00:19:18.917\nwhat we call the Resource requirement\ninside of our project plan as well, okay?\n\n368\n00:19:18.917 --> 00:19:23.158\nSo the only way that we can really tell if\nthis is something that's actually not just\n\n369\n00:19:23.158 --> 00:19:23.955\na pet project.\n\n370\n00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:27.140\nIn other words, I just want to make it\norange because I want to make it orange,\n\n371\n00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.080\nwhatever it might be.\n\n372\n00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.580\nOr, we definitely need hats.\n\n373\n00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:34.033\nAll these statues,\nwhatever it might be, right?\n\n374\n00:19:34.033 --> 00:19:36.609\nWell, the only way that you\ndo this honestly, right,\n\n375\n00:19:36.609 --> 00:19:39.790\nis that you start preparing\nthose performance reports.\n\n376\n00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:44.260\nSo when I went back and we took a look\nat this idea, the WBS here, and\n\n377\n00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.240\nreceiving performance information.\n\n378\n00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:51.210\nPerfectly fine that you as a project\nmanager make decisions based off of that.\n\n379\n00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:56.280\nBut here, in this particular instance,\nyou may find out that as a project manager\n\n380\n00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.050\nthat there is something that you missed\nduring the planning of this resource, and\n\n381\n00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.500\nthat you need to actually have your\nproject updated because of it and\n\n382\n00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:08.020\nwhat you have to do then at that point is\nget your team leaders to start preparing\n\n383\n00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:12.480\nthose performance reports and to actually\nsee what's actually happening here.\n\n384\n00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.320\nAnd that way, they can go ahead and start\nupdating whatever requirements are there.\n\n385\n00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.470\nIf they realize that\nthey're missing tools,\n\n386\n00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:21.390\nif they realize that they're missing\nsome other requirement, go ahead and\n\n387\n00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:24.520\nupdate it in this way is\nwhat's gonna also happen.\n\n388\n00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:28.630\nSo you may find out that this is another\none, okay, that you're gonna have to do.\n\n389\n00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:32.490\nNow, as a project manager, do you\nhave to prepare performance reports?\n\n390\n00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:37.859\nWell, that depends on who you report to\nas your overarching authority, right?\n\n391\n00:20:37.859 --> 00:20:40.030\n>> Your organizational governance.\n\n392\n00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:40.890\nGovernance.\n\n393\n00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:45.760\nIf they ask for performance reports from\nyou, well you then also have to do that on\n\n394\n00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:50.970\nyour own too, but a lot of times this\nis actually at the work end instead.\n\n395\n00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:54.240\nIn which you're getting your\nparticular team leaders to try and\n\n396\n00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:58.390\ngive you reports, and you're trying to\nactually make sure that they will prepare\n\n397\n00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.280\nthe reports that you're asking for.\n\n398\n00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.818\nTo ensure that you get all the information\nthat you need to make decision too.\n\n399\n00:21:03.818 --> 00:21:08.902\nAnd lastly, of course, when we take\na look here is the idea of scope creep,\n\n400\n00:21:08.902 --> 00:21:11.266\nis what we're trying to prevent.\n\n401\n00:21:11.266 --> 00:21:17.250\n[SOUND] It is, it's kind of the big\nthing that nobody likes to talk about.\n\n402\n00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:21.920\nBut every project ends up being either\nmore, okay, than they thought it would be,\n\n403\n00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.580\nand that's because you\ndidn't consider everything.\n\n404\n00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.980\nAnd it's not easy, right?\n\n405\n00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:32.690\nAs a novice project manager, a lot of\ntimes it's easy to see the big picture,\n\n406\n00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:35.730\nbut it's not easy to see how\nto get to the big picture.\n\n407\n00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:36.250\nSo that means,\n\n408\n00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.870\nyou tend to make overwhelming assumptions\non projects that you go, no, I think\n\n409\n00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:44.800\nI can do that in three weeks when it's in\nreality five is what you'll end up with.\n\n410\n00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.225\nAnd that's because you do.\n\n411\n00:21:46.225 --> 00:21:48.250\nYou see the end product.\n\n412\n00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.430\nYou believe what the team that you have,\nthey can accomplish it in this way.\n\n413\n00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:53.950\nReality kicks in with all\nthe different things and\n\n414\n00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.110\nit becomes larger than you think.\n\n415\n00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.730\nOr you might find out that the way\nthat you thought it could be done,\n\n416\n00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:00.500\nit's not gonna be done that way.\n\n417\n00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:05.040\nAnd this is true of anything that I've\never really worked on the first time,\n\n418\n00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:05.740\nyou know?\n\n419\n00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.290\nI assume that I know what\nthe end product looks like and\n\n420\n00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.150\nI assume I have a road map\nthat actually leads us there.\n\n421\n00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:13.750\nAnd then there's some point that\nsomebody says, you know Ronnie,\n\n422\n00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.560\nyou can't do it that way.\n\n423\n00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.020\nAnd I go, well, why not?\n\n424\n00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.690\nAnd they start explaining\nwhat would have to be done\n\n425\n00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:22.980\nif I were to do it the way that\nI need to do it and go, whoa.\n\n426\n00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.300\nObviously, that's not the right way to go.\n\n427\n00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:30.140\nAnd then I have to start asking for\nsuggestions cuz I didn't realize it.\n\n428\n00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:34.210\nAnd then I have to bring that suggestion\nto change management and say obviously,\n\n429\n00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.750\nI couldn't do it that way, but\nhere is the way we should do it.\n\n430\n00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:41.700\nIs that an okay that we can go ahead and\nstart working that way instead?\n\n431\n00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.280\nSo sometimes you will see that.\n\n432\n00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.260\nWhen you're young and you're new, let\nme not put, when you're new [LAUGH] and\n\n433\n00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:50.940\nyou're a novice at this [LAUGH], then\n>> Could be 80 years old,\n\n434\n00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.810\nyou'd start at a project manager, Ron.\n\n435\n00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:55.110\n>> Don't know why I said that,\nwant to remove that caveat.\n\n436\n00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.200\n>> Ronnie's ageism [LAUGH].\n\n437\n00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.890\n>> I know, tell me about it.\n\n438\n00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:00.050\nSo when this happens, right?\n\n439\n00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:02.590\nIt's easy to assume too much.\n\n440\n00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:06.330\nSo you gotta keep your eye on that\nproject scope as well, because if not,\n\n441\n00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:08.380\nthe project scope will eat you, okay?\n\n442\n00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.970\nIt will absolutely push your boundaries,\n\n443\n00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:13.470\ncuz everybody makes a recommendation,\nright?\n\n444\n00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.850\nYour stakeholders will say,\nhey, can you add this in here?\n\n445\n00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:20.080\nAnd somebody on your team's gonna say,\nyeah, I don't see why not, okay?\n\n446\n00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.630\nAnd then you're gonna have internal people\nthat say, here's what needs to be done.\n\n447\n00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.190\nAnd somebody's gonna say, yeah,\nwe should do it that way.\n\n448\n00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:28.010\nAnd somebody forgets to update you.\n\n449\n00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:30.640\nAnd then, you're gonna always see\nthat all of a sudden here it is.\n\n450\n00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.425\nIt's much bigger than you\nthought it was gonna be.\n\n451\n00:23:32.425 --> 00:23:35.820\nKeeping your eye on means\nmore than anything, right?\n\n452\n00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.970\nKeeping on top of everything else\nthat we really talked about and\n\n453\n00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:43.000\nkeeping on top of that scope statement is\nalso what we're taking a look at as well.\n\n454\n00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.040\nIt's easy if people will follow\nthat change process, right?\n\n455\n00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.610\nAs long as you actually\nkeep on top of that,\n\n456\n00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:53.970\nthen when people say changes\nare to be done, you make it clear.\n\n457\n00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:58.960\nChanges can be done to the project, but\nonly through the official change process.\n\n458\n00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.940\nIt's not gonna be done at a whim.\n\n459\n00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.780\nThat's not gonna be done\nbecause you hear it.\n\n460\n00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.710\nIt has to be done according\nto that change process.\n\n461\n00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:09.640\nAnd that way, it doesn't get out of\nyour scope and you don't realize\n\n462\n00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.840\nthat if somebody adds something in\nthat you didn't even account for.\n\n463\n00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.390\nAnd that means you don't have anybody to\nwork on it, you don't have any money to\n\n464\n00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:16.690\nwork on it, you don't have\nany resources to work on it.\n\n465\n00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:20.300\nIf they add it into scope statement,\nthat means we actually authorize.\n\n466\n00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.130\nAll the accounts, all the money, and\n\n467\n00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:25.770\nall the resources to actually add that\ninto your project, and that's why you\n\n468\n00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:30.670\nwanna actually keep on top of these things\nto make sure that you're managing it well.\n\n469\n00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:34.840\nThe day that you as a project manager\ndecide that the reports aren't worth it,\n\n470\n00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.780\nthe meetings that we talked\nabout aren't worth it.\n\n471\n00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:41.680\nThe idea of tracking\nthe budget is not important.\n\n472\n00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.250\nAs you as the project manager, when you\ndecide that you're not gonna do that,\n\n473\n00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:49.980\nthat's the day that this gonna get be\non due and you're not gonna catch up.\n\n474\n00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.730\nSo, being a good project\nmanager means good vigilance.\n\n475\n00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:54.330\nRight?\n\n476\n00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:57.870\nAnd maintaining this reports and\ngiving the information that you need,\n\n477\n00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:01.320\nto know exactly where your\nproject is at any point in time.\n\n478\n00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.580\nSo make sure you take a look\nat these examples again.\n\n479\n00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:09.270\nThat you're gonna find from the comp t\nexam objectives, and try and figure those\n\n480\n00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:13.510\nout, and try and put yourself in those\nscenarios about what you would look to\n\n481\n00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:16.760\nif you needed to update something, or\nif you needed more information about it.\n\n482\n00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.580\nIt's always gonna be in your project plan,\nbut\n\n483\n00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.050\njust in one of those\nlittle sub-plans instead.\n\n484\n00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:24.290\nSo make sure you actually realize\nwhat some of those are and\n\n485\n00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:28.140\nwhat actions you're actually doing when\nyou work with those particular components.\n\n486\n00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.350\n>> Well, Ronnie, it is a lot of\ninformation, that is for sure.\n\n487\n00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:33.230\nIt's a good thing we broke\nthis up into two parts,\n\n488\n00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:37.220\ncuz like I said before information\noverload can easily occur here.\n\n489\n00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.860\nSo walk through these\nepisodes a few times.\n\n490\n00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.020\nMake sure you understand each one of those\nconcepts, each one of the terms, each\n\n491\n00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:47.890\none of those different components, so that\nyou are prepared for that Project+ exam.\n\n492\n00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:52.150\nRonnie, Thank you for so faithfully\nexplaining these concepts to us and\n\n493\n00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:53.520\nthese different components.\n\n494\n00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.090\nBut, it looks like we've come to the end\nof yet another excellent episode.\n\n495\n00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:57.310\nHopefully, you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n496\n00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.820\nWe've got a lot of great\ninformation out of it.\n\n497\n00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:02.540\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off for IT\nPro TV, I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n498\n00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.180\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n499\n00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:07.115\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n500\n00:26:07.115 -->

ITPROTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:19.920\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are moving on with our Project+\n\n4\n00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.572\nseries Joining us back in the studio again\ntoday to lend his expertise on that very\n\n5\n00:00:23.572 --> 00:00:26.121\ntopic, our good friend and\nmentor, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:27.530\nRonnie, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n7\n00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.050\n>> Thank you for having me back on\nthe show as we continue on with\n\n8\n00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.050\nCompTIA's Project+.\n\n9\n00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.870\nToday we're taking a look at the idea\nof the change process that has to go on\n\n10\n00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.380\nwithin projects.\n\n11\n00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.709\nNow, when we start talking about it,\nthe idea of change management is one of\n\n12\n00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:44.519\nthe most important things that we\ncan do during our execution and\n\n13\n00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.120\nour monitoring and\ncontrolling of the project.\n\n14\n00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.460\nSo even when we plan everything out, we're\nactually also still supposed to be able to\n\n15\n00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.080\nuse this, especially when\nchanges do hit our project,\n\n16\n00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.770\nand it's very important\nthat we understand that.\n\n17\n00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.150\nRight before the show as we were talking a\nlittle bit and getting ready for this, one\n\n18\n00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.930\nof the hardest things to do when we start\ntalking, especially about the process of\n\n19\n00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.850\nchange management here, is the management\npart of the change management.\n\n20\n00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.040\nI know that sounds strange, but remember\nthat it's easy to talk about changes and\n\n21\n00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.540\nwhat we really need to do\nin terms of the process,\n\n22\n00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.560\nit's much harder to talk about the\nmanagement of the change process itself,\n\n23\n00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.080\nwhich is what we really need to\nfocus in on on our show today,\n\n24\n00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.500\nbecause that's where we come at it from\nthe actual project management standpoint.\n\n25\n00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.750\nIt's not that changes\nare bad to your project.\n\n26\n00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.690\nChanges will happen in your project,\n\n27\n00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.040\nsometimes on a daily basis\nbecause of things that go on.\n\n28\n00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.420\nSometimes though,\nthe very fact is changes happen, and\n\n29\n00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.910\nwe don't know that they've happened,\nthat's when it's a bad process.\n\n30\n00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.900\nAnd that means that what we want to do,\nbefore anything happens here, right, is to\n\n31\n00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.690\nmake sure that we have a good solid plan\nthat helps us to manage when changes do\n\n32\n00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.910\nend up getting requested for our project,\nand then be able to manage them so that we\n\n33\n00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.820\nsee them all the way through the way that\nthey need to be able to be seen through.\n\n34\n00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.310\nIf not, these changes are gonna affect\nour entire project whether it's\n\n35\n00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.070\nactually the schedule and\nit ends up being late, or\n\n36\n00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.250\nwhether the project's gonna\ncost us too much money, or\n\n37\n00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.750\nwhether it's gonna affect the over all\nquality of our project, or the actual\n\n38\n00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.620\nend requirements of our project,\nthat's what we have to worry about.\n\n39\n00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.250\nSo, what we're gonna focusing on today, of\ncourse then, is to take a look at multiple\n\n40\n00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.420\nscenarios that will help us to understand\non what we have to do as project managers\n\n41\n00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.960\nand what we have to make sure that we\nget set in place as project managers, so\n\n42\n00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.480\nthat we can manage\nthe change process itself.\n\n43\n00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.200\n>> Yes, Ronnie,\n\n44\n00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.120\nwe were having a good time talking\nabout this before the show started.\n\n45\n00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.460\nIt's not about actually doing the change\nthat we're talking today, even though\n\n46\n00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.370\nyou're going to do the change, it's\ngonna be a part of it, it's more about\n\n47\n00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.198\nmanaging the process and implementations\nthat go along with Change Management.\n\n48\n00:02:52.198 --> 00:02:53.188\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n49\n00:02:53.188 --> 00:02:55.160\n>> It can seem very confusing but\n\n50\n00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.300\nhopefully we will remove the veil and\nclear the fog and\n\n51\n00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.860\neverything will look a little more\nclear by the end of this episode.\n\n52\n00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.680\nThat being said Ronnie, where do we begin,\n\n53\n00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.410\nhow do we start to implement\nproper change procedures?\n\n54\n00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.480\n>> Well see in that,\nthat's the hard part we're talking about.\n\n55\n00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.940\nThe very fact it's fun to actually talk\nabout the change process especially when\n\n56\n00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.530\ngo through it with people and\n\n57\n00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.980\nthey've actually been a part\nof change management process.\n\n58\n00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.910\nIt lets you understand the logic\nbehind it a little bit better but\n\n59\n00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.730\nit's much more difficult when you have\nto now start talking about the idea\n\n60\n00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.140\nof procedures, and documents, and\ndifferent things that we're gonna use as\n\n61\n00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.220\nproject managers to insure that\nwe know what's going on and\n\n62\n00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.560\nto make sure that we have a nice uniform\ncoverage of every change that happens.\n\n63\n00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.980\nSo the end result of what our process is,\nright, and when we talk about\n\n64\n00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.800\nthe management of change process here,\nis to ensure that we as a project manager\n\n65\n00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.510\nunderstand that any changes that come on\nboard, that they're gonna be handled in\n\n66\n00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.240\nthe professional way that we need them\nhandled, and they're gonna be treated in\n\n67\n00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.470\nthe manner that's really gonna actually\nmake us focus in on the project better.\n\n68\n00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.070\nWhat we don't want is any change\nto go on without our knowledge.\n\n69\n00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.170\nSo how do we ensure something\nlike that happens so\n\n70\n00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.090\nthat we can continue to actually\nunderstand and be able to manage changes?\n\n71\n00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.660\nIt really breaks down into\nfour different components\n\n72\n00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.520\nof the change management process.\n\n73\n00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.440\nLet's take a look at those components in\nan overview, and then we'll back and we'll\n\n74\n00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.870\nhit them a little bit more in detail and\nwe'll talk about some of the scenarios.\n\n75\n00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.800\nSo, on my computer here I went ahead and\ncreated a small kinda diagram here for\n\n76\n00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.330\nus to help us out here or a list.\n\n77\n00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.830\nSo the first thing that we need to do,\n\n78\n00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.000\nis we need to talk about the idea of\nidentifying the change, and then we'll\n\n79\n00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.710\ntalk about of course, performing an impact\nanalysis and where that also comes from.\n\n80\n00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.490\nAnd then we coordinate with team members\nand stakeholders to select a proper course\n\n81\n00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.380\nof action, now that we have the fact that\nwe might have a change that we need to do.\n\n82\n00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.980\nAnd then lastly we need to also make sure\nthat we understand that updating that\n\n83\n00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.075\nproject plan is actually gonna be a part\nof the change management process.\n\n84\n00:04:51.075 --> 00:04:55.416\nIt's one of those unusual things\nwhere you we leave it as last, but\n\n85\n00:04:55.416 --> 00:04:58.390\nit's probably something that's\nactually very important as more and\n\n86\n00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.520\nmore changes come on board\nwhen we get requested or\n\n87\n00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.130\nwe're not gonna know whether or\nnot a change has been done.\n\n88\n00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.640\nSo let's go ahead and\nstart back here at the beginning.\n\n89\n00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.830\nWhen we start talking about something\nthat's actually very easy for us and\n\n90\n00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.710\nvery intuitive here, that if we are going\nto manage the changes, what we want\n\n91\n00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.940\nto do of course is be able to actually\nhave a way of identifying the change.\n\n92\n00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.070\nNow when we start talking\nabout identifying the change,\n\n93\n00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.760\nyou might just say yeah,\nwhen a change needs to be done,\n\n94\n00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:31.060\nsomebody just needs to let somebody\nknow that a change is done, and\n\n95\n00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:37.140\nthat is really kinda the very kernel of\nthe truth of that idea of identification,\n\n96\n00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.010\nbut the problem is,\nhow do you manage that?\n\n97\n00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.220\nHow do you manage the fact\nthat I told Daniel that,\n\n98\n00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.240\nDaniel we need to have this change?\n\n99\n00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.570\nSo let's take for an example here as a\nscenario that we can actually use here in\n\n100\n00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.550\nan instance is to sit and go this,\nthat I notice that a piece\n\n101\n00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.900\nof equipment that we are constantly using\nDaniel on our project, it keeps failing.\n\n102\n00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.890\nWe fix it, it works for a couple days, it\nfails again, we fit it again, it works for\n\n103\n00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.410\na day then we continue to do that.\n\n104\n00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.160\nWell, I just sit there, and\nI mention to Daniel, Daniel,\n\n105\n00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.440\nwe need to replace this machine, okay?\n\n106\n00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.740\nNow, in my mind, okay,\nwhat am I essentially telling Daniel?\n\n107\n00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.370\nThat I believe that the machine\nneeds to be replaced, and\n\n108\n00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.660\ntherefore, that could now become\na change that happens in our project.\n\n109\n00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.830\nDaniel, though, hears it and says he\njust agrees, it's just an agreement.\n\n110\n00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.150\nWe've talked about the idea that we were\narguing a little bit before on logic.\n\n111\n00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.150\nThe idea is how is it heard, right?\n\n112\n00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.990\nWhat I-\n>> The perception.\n\n113\n00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.920\n>> Yeah, the perception of it\nis what ends up happening.\n\n114\n00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.910\nWell you can't manage perception, nor\ncan I manage perception, so what ends up\n\n115\n00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.090\nhappening is that Daniel hears one thing,\nand I said one thing, right?\n\n116\n00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.600\nI said that machine needs to be changed.\n\n117\n00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.870\nDaniel agrees.\n\n118\n00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.320\nThree days later, I look at Daniel and go,\nDaniel, why is that machine still here,\n\n119\n00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.120\nwhy didn't we actually change it out for\na new one?\n\n120\n00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.840\nAnd Daniel says, well,\nyou didn't tell me to change it.\n\n121\n00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.020\nWe didn't actually have any process in\nchange here, so how do we know that it's\n\n122\n00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.090\nactually gonna be something that in our\nproject can actually get managed and\n\n123\n00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.750\nthen can actually have something done\nabout it, okay, is what we need to do.\n\n124\n00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:20.310\nSo the first part is to figure out, how do\nwe identify when a change has to happen.\n\n125\n00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.900\nNot just identify that there is a problem,\nbut\n\n126\n00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.020\nhow do we actually begin to identify\nthat a change has happened?\n\n127\n00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.230\nWell, there's two particular methods that\nwe can actually use here to do so, and\n\n128\n00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.130\nthey really do revolve around\nsomething that we joke about it, but\n\n129\n00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.400\nit's very important,\nespecially on a very tight budget here,\n\n130\n00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.060\non a very tight schedule, is to actually\ndo the idea of documentation, right?\n\n131\n00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.373\nSo let's talk about the two that we can\nactually take a look at here, okay?\n\n132\n00:07:45.373 --> 00:07:50.056\nSo when you as a project manager and\nsomebody actually brings you something,\n\n133\n00:07:50.056 --> 00:07:53.944\none of the first things that you\nwant to do is you wanna go ahead and\n\n134\n00:07:53.944 --> 00:07:57.565\nmarket in what we call a request log,\na Change Request Log.\n\n135\n00:07:57.565 --> 00:08:00.891\nLet me see if I can bring\nup an example of this\n\n136\n00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:01.819\n>> Yeah, there we go.\n\n137\n00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:07.070\nAnd let me zoom back out just a little\nbit, and we'll take a look at this one.\n\n138\n00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.840\nNow, this particular request log is part\nof what you might have in your project\n\n139\n00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.050\nmanagement plan that allows you, and\nyou might have sheets of these, right?\n\n140\n00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.160\nSo, let's say that I've actually\ngot this on an electronic document,\n\n141\n00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.720\nwhich is perfectly fine.\n\n142\n00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.240\nSo up here,\n\n143\n00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.510\nyou would simply write in, you'd print\nthis out, you'd write in your name and\n\n144\n00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.970\nyour project manager or your project name,\nand then who the project manager is.\n\n145\n00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.520\nYou can include dates in there,\nbut that’s not so important for\n\n146\n00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.910\nthis as far as the entire log goes.\n\n147\n00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:37.420\nBut when you take look at the way\nthat this is done as far as logging,\n\n148\n00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:41.500\nlet’s say that what we do is we go ahead\nand assign it an identification number.\n\n149\n00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.240\nAnd this is important when we talk about\nassigning an identification number.\n\n150\n00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.030\nThe reason why is that, even though\nthis is for me to keep track of,\n\n151\n00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.876\nwhat I would end up giving to someone\nthat is making the request itself.\n\n152\n00:08:52.876 --> 00:08:56.680\nDid I close that, apparently I\nclosed that other document out here.\n\n153\n00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.690\nIs that I would give them\na change request form, okay?\n\n154\n00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:02.410\nNow, if I give them a change request form,\n\n155\n00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.880\nthis number's also going\nto be on that form so\n\n156\n00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.680\nthat there's a tracking or an audit\nthat we can follow all the way through.\n\n157\n00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.680\nSo I go in and assign this here.\n\n158\n00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.780\nAnd then, on that change request,\nI go and mark that number down and\n\n159\n00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.610\nI hand it Daniel, or I hand it to\nwhoever's actually making this.\n\n160\n00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.560\nSo, let's say that Daniel went in and\nsubmitted an assignment.\n\n161\n00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.180\nI know I kinda pre-dated it here, next\nweek at some point, right, on the 14th,\n\n162\n00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.720\non the Monday.\n\n163\n00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.220\nAnd the description here is\nthat he's telling me that,\n\n164\n00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.610\nlook, I realized something, I'm gonna\nfall behind on my particular work package\n\n165\n00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.660\nif I don't get enough help\nin the following week.\n\n166\n00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.870\nSo, what he's done is he's asked for\nan additional person on his project for\n\n167\n00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.290\none week.\n\n168\n00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.700\nAnd there's the requester.\n\n169\n00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.470\nAnd at this point here,\nthis is where I would keep track.\n\n170\n00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.157\nNow, I may just have that\ninformation up to this point, okay?\n\n171\n00:09:46.157 --> 00:09:48.090\nI may not have anything else.\n\n172\n00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.692\nBut during that point,\nif that was actually now submitted, and\n\n173\n00:09:51.692 --> 00:09:55.050\nI submitted it to the change control\nboard, which is what CCB stands for,\n\n174\n00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:59.390\nchange control board, then I can\nget a decision back from them and\n\n175\n00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:03.030\nthey can tell me whether if it's been\napproved or not, and I can close that out,\n\n176\n00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:08.070\nwhich actually indicates that now Daniel\nhas actually gotten his official response\n\n177\n00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.920\nfrom what that change is suppose to be.\n\n178\n00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.064\nSo, one of these things right here\nis actually kinda the key, right?\n\n179\n00:10:14.064 --> 00:10:18.520\nThat you can keep track of it as the\ninformation starts going back and forth.\n\n180\n00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.280\nThe other one is that change request doc.\n\n181\n00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.170\nAnd let me see if I can actually pull\nthat one up here, which is this one.\n\n182\n00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.480\nAnd this is what we would give to Daniel.\n\n183\n00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.300\nAnd this right here,\n\n184\n00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.660\nnotice the change number that you see,\nor we could call it ID number, again.\n\n185\n00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.560\nYou just write that up as you're\nactually the project manager.\n\n186\n00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.870\nOr if this is in your project management\noffice, they can go there and\n\n187\n00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.590\nthey'll assign a number here.\n\n188\n00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:43.580\nAnd from that point, it just depends on\nhow detailed your project wants to be.\n\n189\n00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.952\nYou can see where it actually lists\nthe categories of change, and\n\n190\n00:10:46.952 --> 00:10:50.750\nwhether it's scope, quality, requirements,\ncost, schedule, documentation.\n\n191\n00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.310\nWhatever it is, you go ahead and\n\n192\n00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.400\nyou submit that right there\nby simply check-marking it.\n\n193\n00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.380\nAdd in your other details, as well.\n\n194\n00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.930\nAnd these are normally handwritten\nunless you do have an electronic\n\n195\n00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.470\ntemplate of some sort.\n\n196\n00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.080\nJustification.\n\n197\n00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.540\nAnd then, you also need to include the\nimpact that you think it's gonna cause.\n\n198\n00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.950\nNow, we're gonna talk about impact and\nrisk management a little bit later on, and\n\n199\n00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.050\nmanaging that.\n\n200\n00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.430\nBut what we're supposed to know is,\nis this change really gonna impact me?\n\n201\n00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:17.350\nWell, I can at least let them know,\n\n202\n00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:21.590\nyes, it will help keep my work\npackage on schedule, okay?\n\n203\n00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.140\nI could do something like that.\n\n204\n00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.950\nOr, if I don't have it,\nI could actually indicate that.\n\n205\n00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.230\nHere's why the change is actually needed,\ntoo.\n\n206\n00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:33.630\nSo, you can actually see that and whether\nit's the scope, the grid, requirements,\n\n207\n00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.120\ncost, you can add in all that\ninformation that's gonna be relevant.\n\n208\n00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.170\nAdditional comments,\nif you choose to, and justification.\n\n209\n00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.450\nAnd this particular point right here,\nright, on the disposition, that's for\n\n210\n00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:48.300\nthat change of management board to go\nahead and take a look at and to tell us\n\n211\n00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.550\nwhether they've approved it, deferred it\nor actually rejected it at this point.\n\n212\n00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.760\nAnd why is that important?\n\n213\n00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.760\nBecause, in change management, right,\nin the idea of following the process of\n\n214\n00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.860\nchange, we're no longer talking\nabout Daniel's perception here.\n\n215\n00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.530\nOkay?\n\n216\n00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:03.720\nWhat can I do now?\n\n217\n00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.130\nI can show Daniel that\nthe change that he requested,\n\n218\n00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.810\nit's actually been logged, okay?\n\n219\n00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.760\nHe submitted it in writing.\n\n220\n00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.850\nI've taken that document and actually\nsubmitted it to the change request board.\n\n221\n00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.600\nDaniel now has an answer\nthat's actually official.\n\n222\n00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.870\nI have tracked it and\nI'm monitoring it, and I say,\n\n223\n00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:25.470\nDaniel, put the extra person that\nyou need on schedule next week.\n\n224\n00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.010\nAnd we're ready to go.\n\n225\n00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.750\nAnd that's what we talk about\nin terms of management, right?\n\n226\n00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:30.720\nUp until that point,\n\n227\n00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.890\nthe scenario that I gave you is something\nthat really does happen, right, Daniel?\n\n228\n00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:38.410\nIn which I go, yeah, we should replace\nthat, and Daniel goes, I agree.\n\n229\n00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.250\nAnd for two weeks nothing happens.\n\n230\n00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:45.040\n>> Yeah, Ronnie, actually, I think it's\na perfect illustration of exactly why we\n\n231\n00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.880\nneed change management, right?\n\n232\n00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:52.180\nIt's so that when we do identify a place\nwhere a change needs to be occurring,\n\n233\n00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.160\nthat a change needs to happen,\n\n234\n00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.640\nthat we officially have a way to verify\nthat that change is going to occur.\n\n235\n00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.870\nBecause it is exactly what Ronnie said.\n\n236\n00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.400\nIt is something that happens a day\nto day basis, I guarantee it.\n\n237\n00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.060\nThat Ronnie goes, man,\n\n238\n00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:10.000\nthat little piece of machinery\nthere is a real piece of garbage.\n\n239\n00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.060\nWe should change that out,\n\n240\n00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.840\nwe should get something different\nthat's not gonna let us down every day.\n\n241\n00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.085\nAnd I go, yep.\n\n242\n00:13:15.085 --> 00:13:17.240\n[LAUGH] You're absolutely right.\n\n243\n00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:22.120\nRonnie takes it as, man, you're my project\nmanager, you've heard my request, and\n\n244\n00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.110\nyou're gonna make that happen.\n\n245\n00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:26.100\nI heard it as right, Ronnie is correct,\n\n246\n00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.160\nthat is a garbage machine [LAUGH] and\nI hope he can work his way around it.\n\n247\n00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.730\nI'm just agreeing with him,\nnot that I'm acquiescing to what he wants,\n\n248\n00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.940\nwhich is a different machine\nthat's gonna work for him.\n\n249\n00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:38.820\nThrough change management,\n\n250\n00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:43.610\nI can say I'm officially logging the fact\nthat Ronnie needs a new machine.\n\n251\n00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.250\nIt's going through official channels.\n\n252\n00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.470\nThere is no obscurity to it.\n\n253\n00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.900\nAnything that is wrong about it,\nRonnie can look at and\n\n254\n00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.550\nsay, that's not what I mean.\n\n255\n00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:57.630\nAll the definitions and terms that\nwe need to come to an agreement on\n\n256\n00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.650\ncan be done before any\nchange actually gets made.\n\n257\n00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:04.150\nAnd that's why we're really talking\nabout managing change management and\n\n258\n00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:08.290\nnot necessarily the processes themselves.\n\n259\n00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:09.320\nThat's exactly right.\n\n260\n00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.250\nSo, Ronnie, great illustration.\n\n261\n00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.340\nI think you really nailed the point home,\nand\n\n262\n00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.260\nthat takes us to some other cool\nprocedures that we might wanna do.\n\n263\n00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.080\n>> It really does.\n\n264\n00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.070\nWhen we start seeing this, right,\nsome of the changes might be easy.\n\n265\n00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.980\nThe very fact that the piece of machinery\nthat we mentioned really is a piece\n\n266\n00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.610\nof junk, and everybody just agrees,\nlet's just go ahead and\n\n267\n00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:27.660\nget this signed and let us get it done.\n\n268\n00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:28.760\nBut sometimes, though,\n\n269\n00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.670\nthose decisions are not as easy as we\nthink that they are actually going to be.\n\n270\n00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.710\nSo, the reason why that might be,\nright, is just like everything else.\n\n271\n00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:43.210\nAnd we've learned this in IT,\nthat regardless of how old something gets,\n\n272\n00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:46.270\nif it's functional and\nnobody is complaining about it,\n\n273\n00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:49.850\nit's really hard to decommission\nsomethings at times, okay?\n\n274\n00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:53.870\nAnd that means that regardless, right,\nof whether anybody's actually using it or\n\n275\n00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.410\nnot, when you ask somebody\nif anybody needs it, what,\n\n276\n00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:57.700\nessentially, ends up happening?\n\n277\n00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.650\nYou better believe it.\n\n278\n00:14:58.650 --> 00:14:59.350\nI need it.\n\n279\n00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.172\nAnd I remember this\nhappening to me one time.\n\n280\n00:15:01.172 --> 00:15:06.710\nI had actually set up some infrastructure\nin Alabama a few years ago.\n\n281\n00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:11.370\nAnd so, I went at there to try and kinda\nmove everything to these servers and stuff\n\n282\n00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:16.110\nlike that and there was one particular\nserver that was still running on the rack.\n\n283\n00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:18.250\nAnd I said, what is this machine for?\n\n284\n00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.200\nAnd they told me what it was for.\n\n285\n00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.280\nAnd then, I said, all right, so\nis everybody still using it?\n\n286\n00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.700\nSaid no, there's only one\nperson that's still using it.\n\n287\n00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:30.930\nAnd so, I went to them and I said,\nhow often do you use this?\n\n288\n00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.760\nI don't use it very often,\nbut I do need it, okay?\n\n289\n00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.030\nI absolutely, 100% need it.\n\n290\n00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.630\nAnd so, at that point,\nwe're not changing, right?\n\n291\n00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.320\nWe're leaving the thing\nthe way that it needs to be.\n\n292\n00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.720\nBut we really need to\nmove off that system.\n\n293\n00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.810\nSo, what did I do?\n\n294\n00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.150\nI wanted to see how often you use it,\nI simply turned it off.\n\n295\n00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.250\nI probably shouldn't have.\n\n296\n00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.560\nBut I simply turned it off for\nthe remainder of that week.\n\n297\n00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.047\n>> Bold, my friend.\n\n298\n00:15:50.047 --> 00:15:50.731\nBold move.\n\n299\n00:15:50.731 --> 00:15:52.847\n>> It was a bold move cuz I thought,\nwell if he says it,\n\n300\n00:15:52.847 --> 00:15:55.776\nhe can't get access to that and\nthey all turn it back on and I'll know.\n\n301\n00:15:55.776 --> 00:16:00.731\nBut the whole week I was there trying to\nmake all the other changes Never once\n\n302\n00:16:00.731 --> 00:16:01.999\ndid he request it.\n\n303\n00:16:01.999 --> 00:16:03.762\nAnd as far as I know, he never did.\n\n304\n00:16:03.762 --> 00:16:05.630\nHe never requested it turned back on.\n\n305\n00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.030\nSo he just wanted to know it was there.\n\n306\n00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:11.440\nSometimes you are going\nto get request like that,\n\n307\n00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.250\nwhere somebody will stand against it,\nokay, no matter what.\n\n308\n00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.070\nWell now, what do you have?\n\n309\n00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:20.480\nYou now have a change and you now have\na counter to somebody says, no way,\n\n310\n00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.280\nwe don't need to implement that change.\n\n311\n00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.530\nWell, what do you do, okay?\n\n312\n00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.780\nHow do you manage that process, okay?\n\n313\n00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:31.790\nWell, if we don't manage it what it comes\ndown to is Dan's work versus mine, okay?\n\n314\n00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.680\nI justify though, we need to modernize.\n\n315\n00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.820\nYou haven't touched that\nmachine in two years.\n\n316\n00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:41.130\nDaniel can come back and go, but I know\nthe information that's on that machine\n\n317\n00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:44.880\nis so valuable to your organization,\nwe need to keep it up and running.\n\n318\n00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.730\nAnd so now here you are, you wanting\nto move forward with your project and\n\n319\n00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:53.020\nhe’s saying, no,\nthis is really important to me.\n\n320\n00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.680\nAnd now it’s a he said, he said situation.\n\n321\n00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.840\nWell, what do you do?\n\n322\n00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.300\nHow do you manage that process and change?\n\n323\n00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.050\nWell, you can’t if it’s just that.\n\n324\n00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.677\nIf it comes down to an argument between\nme and him, we could flip for it and\n\n325\n00:17:04.677 --> 00:17:06.235\nit would come out just as good.\n\n326\n00:17:06.235 --> 00:17:07.346\nAs somebody trying to go,\n\n327\n00:17:07.346 --> 00:17:10.581\nwell Daniel's argument is actually\na little bit stronger than Ronnie's.\n\n328\n00:17:10.581 --> 00:17:13.667\nThat would be just as fair,\njust flipping for it instead.\n\n329\n00:17:13.667 --> 00:17:16.663\nBut in change management though,\nif you want to manage this,\n\n330\n00:17:16.663 --> 00:17:19.300\nwhat you do instead is\nour second point here.\n\n331\n00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.640\nWhich is you want to perform\nwhat we call an impact analysis.\n\n332\n00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.640\nNow, in the way that I performed\nan impact analysis, it was simple, right?\n\n333\n00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.650\nI turned off the machine to see whether or\nnot it would actually impact anybody.\n\n334\n00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.221\n[LAUGH]\n>> It was a very effective impact\n\n335\n00:17:32.221 --> 00:17:33.552\nanalysis, though, wasn't it Ronnie?\n\n336\n00:17:33.552 --> 00:17:38.420\n>> It was incredibly effective, that let\nme know that that machine could be off.\n\n337\n00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.470\nBut the problem is,\nthe way that I did it right,\n\n338\n00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:43.030\ncuz I had no real authorization to do so.\n\n339\n00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.260\nI simply just wanted to\nsee what would happen.\n\n340\n00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.770\nSo normally when we talk about\nthe idea of impact analysis here,\n\n341\n00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:54.125\nwhat we wanna do is when changes like\nthat happen, right, is that we wanna see,\n\n342\n00:17:54.125 --> 00:17:57.895\nwe wanna actually be able to know by\ndoing a little bit more research,\n\n343\n00:17:57.895 --> 00:18:02.445\nby taking a little bit more time to gather\nthe additional information that we need,\n\n344\n00:18:02.445 --> 00:18:05.191\nto present that change management board,\nokay?\n\n345\n00:18:05.191 --> 00:18:07.559\nNow we're not doing this to\ndisprove Daniel's point, okay.\n\n346\n00:18:07.559 --> 00:18:11.945\nI'm not doing it to bolster my point,\nI'm trying to actually ensure that hey,\n\n347\n00:18:11.945 --> 00:18:14.630\nthis machine can actually be turned off.\n\n348\n00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:18.470\nOr we can actually replace that machine\nwithout there being very much loss or\n\n349\n00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:19.690\nany loss at all.\n\n350\n00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:22.360\nAnd that we can restore it\nvery quickly if we need to.\n\n351\n00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.660\nSo this may take a bit of fact finding,\nbut\n\n352\n00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.220\nit takes a bit of investigation, right?\n\n353\n00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.680\nYou ask questions that you might need.\n\n354\n00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.240\nSo sometimes you might actually\nask certain questions here.\n\n355\n00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.570\nShould the change happen?\n\n356\n00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.910\nOkay, that's actually a great\nquestion that you might wanna ask\n\n357\n00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:39.190\nduring the impact analysis.\n\n358\n00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:44.660\nHow does the change impact the overall\nproject if it doesn't get done, okay?\n\n359\n00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.880\nYou might find out something that even\nthough you think very strongly about,\n\n360\n00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.800\nhey we've gotta get this done.\n\n361\n00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.110\nEverybody else is fighting against it, but\nin the long run for the overall project,\n\n362\n00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.380\nright, you might find out that it\nreally doesn't impact anything.\n\n363\n00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.550\nWe can leave that thing on.\n\n364\n00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:02.730\nIt's not great, but in the end if they\nreally want it, and you're fighting\n\n365\n00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:06.110\nagainst everybody else, you might go,\nyeah let me concede that point.\n\n366\n00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.170\nYou might even go ahead and check out and\n\n367\n00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:11.470\nsee, is your change really\ngonna outweigh the negatives?\n\n368\n00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:14.660\nIn other words, do a benefit and\nnegative type of analysis there.\n\n369\n00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.860\nThe change that you're actually\nimplementing that moves them to a new\n\n370\n00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.840\nsystem, is it an effective change?\n\n371\n00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.580\nIs it something that\nreally needs to be done?\n\n372\n00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.420\nYou better believe it, or\nwe wouldn’t be doing it.\n\n373\n00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.204\nEven though people don’t tend\nto agree with IT at times, and\n\n374\n00:19:27.204 --> 00:19:30.969\nI know because I’ve heard that they’re\narguing like, no we shouldn’t switch to\n\n375\n00:19:30.969 --> 00:19:34.101\na new system because I’ve still got\nmy stuff over on the old system.\n\n376\n00:19:34.101 --> 00:19:36.721\nAnd I told them,\nI remember telling them like, no,\n\n377\n00:19:36.721 --> 00:19:39.095\nwe moved the database\nover the week before.\n\n378\n00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:42.200\nIt's moved over you,\ncan access it, you can do that,\n\n379\n00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.920\nbut we'll have to learn\na new way to do it.\n\n380\n00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.420\nYeah, you'll have to learn a little\nbit of a new process to do it.\n\n381\n00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.730\nBut all of your information will be there.\n\n382\n00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.319\nAnd as soon as they can actually see their\ninformation's there, they're a little bit\n\n383\n00:19:52.319 --> 00:19:55.856\nhappy, and they go, okay, let me try and\nprint this information, and the first time\n\n384\n00:19:55.856 --> 00:19:58.926\nthat they don't actually have a print,\nyou are toast, I guarantee you.\n\n385\n00:19:58.926 --> 00:20:02.409\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Go, no, the print's located right here.\n\n386\n00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:04.685\nWell, it was located over\nhere on the old system.\n\n387\n00:20:04.685 --> 00:20:07.099\nI know, this is a new system.\n\n388\n00:20:07.099 --> 00:20:10.850\nBut you gotta kinda realize that doing\nthis impact analysis is important,\n\n389\n00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:15.040\ncuz you might find yourself in a battle in\nwhich that change really isn't worth it.\n\n390\n00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.820\n>> Yeah, this is a really good point\nto bring up when it comes to impact.\n\n391\n00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.195\nImpact can be felt in many\ndifferent ways and forms.\n\n392\n00:20:21.195 --> 00:20:24.910\nIf we go back to our junkie machine or\nanalogy, right?\n\n393\n00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:29.280\nWell yeah, we got a real piece of\njunk here, it's always breaking down.\n\n394\n00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:29.920\nSo we say, you know what?\n\n395\n00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.710\nWe're gonna replace it.\n\n396\n00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:34.530\nWe get the latest and greatest new hotness\nwhenever it comes to, maybe it's a,\n\n397\n00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.760\nI don't know, concrete mixer, right?\n\n398\n00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.600\nThe old concrete mixer may have been junk,\nbut it was easy.\n\n399\n00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.890\nYou pulled the the gas cord on it, and\nit started up, and it started spinning.\n\n400\n00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.260\nAnd everybody on the job\nsite could use it.\n\n401\n00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.380\nBut we get the new one, right.\n\n402\n00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.020\nAnd the thing looks like it\ntakes Doc Brown to make it work,\n\n403\n00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.670\na PhD of some sort to\nget the thing to work.\n\n404\n00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.370\nNobody can use the thing.\n\n405\n00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.540\nWell, is that an effective change?\n\n406\n00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.160\nMaybe not.\n\n407\n00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.800\nMaybe it's so\ncomplex they're unable to figure it out.\n\n408\n00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:03.450\nMaybe we have to get some sort of training\ninvolved, and now it's extra cost.\n\n409\n00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:08.010\nSo, getting the impact analysis is\nreally going to help you figure out\n\n410\n00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:12.910\nwhat is the best change when\na change is seen to be required.\n\n411\n00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.500\nSo, very very important thing.\n\n412\n00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.510\n>> Very much so, because you don't want\nyour change manager on board just making\n\n413\n00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.930\nthem because, like,\nman I'm tired of hearing Rodney and\n\n414\n00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:23.210\nDaniel argue about this change,\nlet's just decide for one of them.\n\n415\n00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:25.820\nYou want to make sure that you give them\nthe informed decision that they can, so\n\n416\n00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.970\nthey authorize the right change or\n\n417\n00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:32.120\nthey don't authorize a change that may\nactually be not so beneficial to you.\n\n418\n00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.440\nSo doing that impact analysis may help.\n\n419\n00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.535\nNow you gotta actually kind\nof weigh this out, right.\n\n420\n00:21:36.535 --> 00:21:38.826\nIf the change is something that's dire,\nin other words,\n\n421\n00:21:38.826 --> 00:21:40.621\nif I only had a week to\ncomplete that project.\n\n422\n00:21:40.621 --> 00:21:44.599\nI didn't have two months to do it, I had\na week to actually build everything up and\n\n423\n00:21:44.599 --> 00:21:46.850\nto do everything that we needed to.\n\n424\n00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:50.693\nSo in that instance here, you need to\nactually give them as much information as\n\n425\n00:21:50.693 --> 00:21:53.504\npossible to ensure that you're\nactually gonna do that.\n\n426\n00:21:53.504 --> 00:21:54.479\nAnd for me it was simple.\n\n427\n00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:58.347\nAfter I turned it off, I kinda just called\nmy boss and said, all right here is\n\n428\n00:21:58.347 --> 00:22:02.164\nwhat's happening, here's what I've\nbeen did and he said, smart move.\n\n429\n00:22:02.164 --> 00:22:04.064\nHe said, smart move, he says,\njust see what happens.\n\n430\n00:22:04.064 --> 00:22:05.109\nYou can always turn it back on, right?\n\n431\n00:22:05.109 --> 00:22:09.250\nI was like, you better believe it,\nI can turn it back on if they call for it.\n\n432\n00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:10.720\nBut at that point nobody ever did,\n\n433\n00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.390\nso I was actually pretty much\nspot on the money on that one.\n\n434\n00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:17.480\nBut don't make assumptions,\ndon't do that automatically.\n\n435\n00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.366\nBut just kinda realize that you-\n>> Do a risk analysis, right?\n\n436\n00:22:19.366 --> 00:22:20.842\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you will do that risk analysis.\n\n437\n00:22:20.842 --> 00:22:22.235\n>> Just use that risk analysis.\n\n438\n00:22:22.235 --> 00:22:24.610\n>> Yep, you will have that.\n\n439\n00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:28.158\nNow what happens now that your change,\nlet's say, goes through and\n\n440\n00:22:28.158 --> 00:22:29.761\nhas now been approved, okay.\n\n441\n00:22:29.761 --> 00:22:34.767\nSo now there it is, so Daniel, you now\nhave this document that says they've\n\n442\n00:22:34.767 --> 00:22:39.720\nmarked it, they've approved it and\nit's signed off by everybody.\n\n443\n00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.350\nWell, what do we do next\nas a project manager?\n\n444\n00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:45.015\nWell, what in the world has to be done?\n\n445\n00:22:45.015 --> 00:22:47.716\nWell, this is what we have to\nthink about at times here,\n\n446\n00:22:47.716 --> 00:22:51.660\nis now that we have everything in\nour hand and that we're ready to go.\n\n447\n00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:56.020\nNow, we need to do what we need to be\nable to say, let's get it done okay?\n\n448\n00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:59.224\nWell, just me saying that doesn't\nautomatically spread the word\n\n449\n00:22:59.224 --> 00:23:01.294\nthat's it's gonna be done okay, right?\n\n450\n00:23:01.294 --> 00:23:04.880\nI now need to coordinate with\nstakeholders, team members,\n\n451\n00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.295\nto go, let's do this.\n\n452\n00:23:06.295 --> 00:23:12.750\nOkay, we could take a year and go, let's\npick the best piece of machinery we can.\n\n453\n00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:15.583\nOr what we can do is actually\ncoordinate with everyone and go,\n\n454\n00:23:15.583 --> 00:23:18.959\nlet's see what machinery we can actually\nget within the next three days or\n\n455\n00:23:18.959 --> 00:23:21.854\nnext day and a half, cuz we really\nneed to get this thing going.\n\n456\n00:23:21.854 --> 00:23:23.910\nAnd this is what we end up doing.\n\n457\n00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:27.100\nSo, what you may end up doing now, when we\nstart talking about this, is go ahead and\n\n458\n00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.450\nlet's take a look at my machine here.\n\n459\n00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.600\nWe're talking about, now,\ncoordinating with team members, and\n\n460\n00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.090\nstakeholders to select a course of action.\n\n461\n00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:37.520\nSo, it really depends on what your\ncourse of action is gonna be, okay?\n\n462\n00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.620\nIn project management,\nwhen we start talking about changes,\n\n463\n00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:41.470\nthere's really,\nthree courses of action, and\n\n464\n00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:44.520\nwe'll talk about the last one\nas a separate action there.\n\n465\n00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.301\nThere's corrective\nactions that we can take.\n\n466\n00:23:46.301 --> 00:23:50.580\nOur project is going off course\ncompletely because we're held up, okay?\n\n467\n00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:54.404\nWell this change may actually be made so\nthat we can get right back on course.\n\n468\n00:23:54.404 --> 00:23:58.737\nIf we do that, we realize that we might\nhave to actually involve a ton more people\n\n469\n00:23:58.737 --> 00:24:03.137\nand that might require what we call some\ntype of Of a stakeholder or project status\n\n470\n00:24:03.137 --> 00:24:07.407\nmeeting to make sure everybody's actually\non the process itself, okay, and\n\n471\n00:24:07.407 --> 00:24:10.140\nready to get everything back in line.\n\n472\n00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.290\nWhat if what we see is a change\nthat needs to be done,\n\n473\n00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.520\nbecause we realized something and\nwe don't?\n\n474\n00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:18.030\nOur project is headed completely\noff course somewhere.\n\n475\n00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.719\nIn other words,\nwe need to make some type of prevention so\n\n476\n00:24:20.719 --> 00:24:24.089\nthat it doesn't end up going where\nwe believe it's going to go, okay?\n\n477\n00:24:24.089 --> 00:24:27.340\nOn that point you don't need to\nhave call everybody together, okay?\n\n478\n00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:30.540\nWhat you can do here is actually\nbring together the key members\n\n479\n00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.540\nof your project team and say,\n\n480\n00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:36.450\nwe see that this is what's gonna happen\nif we continue on our same course here.\n\n481\n00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:40.470\nLet's go ahead and talk about it now and\nfigure out what it is that we need to do.\n\n482\n00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:45.340\nWhat steps do we need to do to prevent the\naction from going way South of where we\n\n483\n00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.290\nreally wanted it to go.\n\n484\n00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:51.950\nSo in that sense, it may just be a very\ncalled or specialized meeting of certain\n\n485\n00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:56.250\nstakeholders at that point, instead of\neverybody on your project link team.\n\n486\n00:24:56.250 --> 00:25:00.270\nThen of course, there may just be some\ntype of reparative action instead.\n\n487\n00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:04.750\nAnd this might be where you just go to\nwhoever it is, whether it's an outsourced\n\n488\n00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:08.240\nplace, and say, we need you to\nrepair this, whatever it might be,\n\n489\n00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.650\nyou might actually take the direction\naction yourself to go ahead and do that.\n\n490\n00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:13.210\nIf you're actually the one\nthat's authorized, or\n\n491\n00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:16.250\nyou hand it off to whoever's actually\ngonna be in control of maintenance, or\n\n492\n00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:19.140\nwhatever it might be, and\nthen you do that action.\n\n493\n00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.920\nNow the only other thing that I wanna\nmention here as far as coordinating right,\n\n494\n00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.880\nis that you need a separate process for\nemergent conditions and\n\n495\n00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.580\nthat's emergency situations\nare want we're talk about.\n\n496\n00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:33.445\nEmergent actions tend to happen when\nyou do find out the dam is breaking,\n\n497\n00:25:33.445 --> 00:25:38.247\nokay, [LAUGH] that we're holding it\nright now but what is our next step?\n\n498\n00:25:38.247 --> 00:25:41.824\nBecause there's no doubt that this\nis absolutely going to get beyond\n\n499\n00:25:41.824 --> 00:25:43.010\nour control.\n\n500\n00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:46.770\nYou need to have change management\nthat's gonna react a little bit faster.\n\n501\n00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:51.220\nYou need to make sure that you treat those\nemergencies exactly that, as emergencies.\n\n502\n00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:55.180\nSo don't make them go through the change\ncontrol procedures that you might.\n\n503\n00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.920\nNow you might say that, right?\n\n504\n00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.280\nDo you do that later on though?\n\n505\n00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.550\nYes, okay so let's say an emergency\nends up happening on the project.\n\n506\n00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:07.970\nIt may be where you make an emergency\ndecision and then afterwards, you\n\n507\n00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:13.190\ncome back and you actually implement that\nchange process we were talking about, why?\n\n508\n00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:16.240\nBecause that's for historical\npurposes more than anything else.\n\n509\n00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.720\nSo being able to go back through it and\nactually implement it in proper change\n\n510\n00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.690\nprocedures at that point, telling people\nthat they still need to fill it out.\n\n511\n00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.560\nThey still need to do this allows\nthem to go through the process.\n\n512\n00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:30.190\nAnd now allows somebody to have\na postmortem review of whatever that was.\n\n513\n00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:33.410\nAnd they can then decide,\nthis change did happen.\n\n514\n00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:36.340\nBut, Ronnie,\nin reality we would never have voted for\n\n515\n00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.540\nthat change if we could have, okay?\n\n516\n00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.590\nBut in an emergency you\nmake your decision.\n\n517\n00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:45.265\nYou live with whatever the aftermath\nis and then you have to do that, but\n\n518\n00:26:45.265 --> 00:26:47.110\nyou still wanna record it somehow.\n\n519\n00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:50.916\nThe idea for getting emergencies can\nhappen within your project's really a bad\n\n520\n00:26:50.916 --> 00:26:54.945\nsituation, because then you go through the\nproblem like, we had no issues at all and\n\n521\n00:26:54.945 --> 00:26:58.009\nthen somebody says you remember\nwhen that thing, yeah,\n\n522\n00:26:58.009 --> 00:26:59.960\nI didn't document that at all.\n\n523\n00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.220\nThat's never a good thing.\n\n524\n00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:05.692\n>> Yeah I know, and during those times you\nknow it's not easy to have a committee,\n\n525\n00:27:05.692 --> 00:27:08.720\nwhen like Ronnie said,\nthe dam is basically bursting on you.\n\n526\n00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.010\nYou have to act quickly.\n\n527\n00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:15.321\nIf we have a server that was in the middle\nbeing compromised, what would I do?\n\n528\n00:27:15.321 --> 00:27:18.708\nWould I just sit there and go, well we\ngonna get our heads on IT together and\n\n529\n00:27:18.708 --> 00:27:20.906\ngo through our change\nmanagement system here.\n\n530\n00:27:20.906 --> 00:27:23.838\nAnd well, I got a request to change\nto stop the hacker from doing what\n\n531\n00:27:23.838 --> 00:27:24.660\nhe's doing.\n\n532\n00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.530\nNo, we're gonna snatch\nthe plug out of the thing,\n\n533\n00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:30.680\nbecause that's the immediate reaction\nthat I need to have to get them to stop.\n\n534\n00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.097\nWe need emergency action,\n\n535\n00:27:32.097 --> 00:27:35.680\nnot just a committee of people trying\nto figure out what we should do.\n\n536\n00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:40.765\nNow it's cool if you can have beforehand\nto try to come up with some caveats,\n\n537\n00:27:40.765 --> 00:27:43.710\nsome things you can do\nin case of emergency.\n\n538\n00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:44.820\nAnd we try to do that.\n\n539\n00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.090\nWe always try to put that at hand.\n\n540\n00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:47.670\nBut you can't always make that happen.\n\n541\n00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:49.590\nWhen that happens,\nyou've gotta just react and\n\n542\n00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:53.610\nthen do the best you can about\ndocumenting everything that you did.\n\n543\n00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.820\nAnd then submit that for later review so\n\n544\n00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.590\nthat everybody can take a look and\nsee what happens.\n\n545\n00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:01.860\nMaybe you came up with a great plan on\nthe fly to fix a problem like that, and\n\n546\n00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:05.230\nnow everybody's gonna use that as\nthe standard operating procedure\n\n547\n00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:08.010\nwhen it comes to that particular\ntype of an emergency.\n\n548\n00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:12.270\nAnd now you do have a plan to follow\nin case of those things happening.\n\n549\n00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.710\nSo, Ronnie now that we've gone through,\n\n550\n00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.700\nbasically that's majority of things\nthat can happen to change management.\n\n551\n00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.950\nWe've made a change,\nnow we have one final thing we have to do.\n\n552\n00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:21.500\n>> We really do.\n\n553\n00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.410\nWe need to take a look\nat our project plan and\n\n554\n00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.600\nwe need to update more than anything else.\n\n555\n00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.440\nAnd you might think of this as\nbeing kind of the appendage,\n\n556\n00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.050\nright, the appendix to\neverything that we're doing.\n\n557\n00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:35.110\nBut this is a very important part\nof our change management as well,\n\n558\n00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:39.806\nthat we document it in our plan of\nwhat actually ended up occurring and\n\n559\n00:28:39.806 --> 00:28:40.800\nwhat needs to happen.\n\n560\n00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.740\nSo let's take a look at some of the\ndifferent things that we can talk about\n\n561\n00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:47.640\nhere, in terms of updating the project\nplan component that we need to.\n\n562\n00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.870\nIf you know that resources are gonna be\nreplaced whether they are at the end of\n\n563\n00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.600\na contract or whatever it is,\nmake sure that you\n\n564\n00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.560\nnote that in your project management\nplan as well and update that.\n\n565\n00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.240\nYou wanna update of course\nwhatever the change was made but\n\n566\n00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.910\nalso why the change was made there as to,\nokay.\n\n567\n00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:06.950\nRequirement changes don't\ntend to happen often.\n\n568\n00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:07.790\nBut can they?\n\n569\n00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:08.550\nYes, and\n\n570\n00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:12.770\nif they do, you wanna make sure that you\nalso note something like that as well.\n\n571\n00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:17.260\nMake sure you clarify the reason\nwhy a requirement was changed.\n\n572\n00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.680\nIt's one of those unusual things when\nyou start flipping through your project\n\n573\n00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.770\nplan again.\n\n574\n00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:23.830\nAnd then,\nother people start looking at like, okay,\n\n575\n00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:26.690\nwhy was this particular\nrequirement changed?\n\n576\n00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:30.200\nAnd somebody says, well,\nhere's the change, but why?\n\n577\n00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.100\nI don't remember.\n\n578\n00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.520\nWe did it for, and we started guessing.\n\n579\n00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.434\nThat's the only thing we can\ndo at that point is guess.\n\n580\n00:29:37.434 --> 00:29:41.300\nAnd I guarantee you, your memory may\nbe sharp, but I know after years and\n\n581\n00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.820\nyears, my memory and\n\n582\n00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:46.270\nthe number of projects I worked on,\nI can't tell you it was this project, or\n\n583\n00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:50.360\nthis project until I go back and\ntake a look at some of my documentation.\n\n584\n00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.740\nGo, that's right,\nthat's where I implemented that.\n\n585\n00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:56.050\nAnd the worse for\nme is actually setting initial passwords.\n\n586\n00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:57.880\nI am the worst about that.\n\n587\n00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.942\nI try and use different ones,\nespecially on IT projects.\n\n588\n00:30:00.942 --> 00:30:05.060\nSo that when people say here it's what it\nis, I always think that I use a different\n\n589\n00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:08.997\none, then I tell them the wrong one and\nthey end like let me check again and\n\n590\n00:30:08.997 --> 00:30:12.700\nthen I realize yeah that was for\nanother project instead.\n\n591\n00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.560\nSo, you always want to make sure\nthat you check things like that out.\n\n592\n00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.370\nInfrastructure changes as well.\n\n593\n00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:21.050\nThese are the ones that are gonna\nlast way beyond the lifecycle of\n\n594\n00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:22.400\nthe project, right?\n\n595\n00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.590\nA lot of times infrastructure changes\nhappen to actually be exactly what we\n\n596\n00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:26.550\ntalk right here.\n\n597\n00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:29.070\nEssentially structures that\nare gonna be left behind\n\n598\n00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:32.060\nafter our project is completely done.\n\n599\n00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:35.170\nAnd usually the reason why is that\nit's some type of manufacturing base,\n\n600\n00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:36.940\nthere's something else going on here.\n\n601\n00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.810\nBut when we start seeing stuff like this,\nand\n\n602\n00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:42.930\nwe're changing computer systems out,\nif we switch from one system to the other.\n\n603\n00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:46.726\nLet's say that our project scope began\nwhere we actually gonna be basing this on\n\n604\n00:30:46.726 --> 00:30:50.060\na Linux system okay, whatever it is.\n\n605\n00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.380\nBut then part way through,\n\n606\n00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:55.020\nwe realize because of the way that\nthe company worked, it might be easier and\n\n607\n00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:59.500\nbetter for us to go to Windows and use\nthat as our foundational server instead.\n\n608\n00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.610\nWell, it's a little bit different\nwhen you read the original scope and\n\n609\n00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.730\nit says based on a UNIX server.\n\n610\n00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.680\nAnd then your project at the end,\nand you're running Windows Server or\n\n611\n00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.570\nwhatever edition it is and like whoa,\nwhoa, whoa, wait a minute.\n\n612\n00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:13.460\nOkay, what happened here and\nwhy did you all choose to do that?\n\n613\n00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:17.060\nWell again, you have to actually make\nsure that you understand that those\n\n614\n00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:19.970\nare infrastructure changes and\nshould be noted too.\n\n615\n00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:23.290\nConfiguration changes are probably\nby far the most common\n\n616\n00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:24.480\nones that we actually list here.\n\n617\n00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:28.620\nRight, configuration changes\ncan happen in the IT world.\n\n618\n00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.430\nWe talk about the fact that structures or\nnot structures,\n\n619\n00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:34.710\ncomponent like routers,\nswitches, servers, right.\n\n620\n00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:38.616\nWe may have to reconfigure them to\nactually make them more optimized in\n\n621\n00:31:38.616 --> 00:31:43.460\nthe way that they are, more efficient than\nthe way they were set up originally, here.\n\n622\n00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:46.723\nAnd so, those changes need to be\ndocumented and noted as well, and\n\n623\n00:31:46.723 --> 00:31:49.180\nwe also have to explain those changes.\n\n624\n00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:53.120\nWell, again, knowing that the change\nhappened, I can still go, Daniel,\n\n625\n00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.320\nI know that we made that change, and\nthen, Daniel can sit there and go,\n\n626\n00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.750\nwell, why did we make it and\nwhen did we make it?\n\n627\n00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:01.220\nI don't know, documenting it down, right?\n\n628\n00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:04.790\nMaking sure it's actually there, is part\nof that process, and we can go back and\n\n629\n00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:08.120\nfind out when and why it was also done.\n\n630\n00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.220\nAnd this is actually all\nthe components that we need\n\n631\n00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.300\nwhen we start talking about\nmanaging change, right?\n\n632\n00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:20.050\nUpdating, making sure we can identify what\nthe actual risk or the change is, right?\n\n633\n00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.800\nMaking sure that we actually submit\nit in proper documentation and form.\n\n634\n00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.660\nReviewing the process,\ndoing the impact analysis, you name it.\n\n635\n00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.900\nGetting the proper team up,\nupdating the project plan.\n\n636\n00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:34.650\nAll of this is about that management\nside of change management.\n\n637\n00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.423\nI know it's a mouthful.\n\n638\n00:32:36.423 --> 00:32:38.781\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But that is what we're really focusing\n\n639\n00:32:38.781 --> 00:32:42.400\nin on is, how do we manage that\nparticular process itself?\n\n640\n00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.560\nSo if you can actually understand that,\nyou are well on your way to\n\n641\n00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.380\nactually becoming a better project\nmanager, especially when changes happen.\n\n642\n00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:54.470\n>> Well Ronnie, I know it is\na difficult topic to tackle, but\n\n643\n00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:57.500\nyou did it with style and\npizzazz and panache.\n\n644\n00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:58.789\nVery well done sir and we appreciate it.\n\n645\n00:32:58.789 --> 00:33:00.026\nHopefully you guys,\n\n646\n00:33:00.026 --> 00:33:04.219\nI thought he did a great job of\nexplaining all those different procedures\n\n647\n00:33:04.219 --> 00:33:08.150\nthat we might go through to\nmanage change management itself.\n\n648\n00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:10.230\nSo don't get hooked up on or\n\n649\n00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.910\nstumble over the verbiage that we're\nusing, the terminology that we're using.\n\n650\n00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:18.890\nFocus more on the fact that we are trying\nto basically give an overview of how\n\n651\n00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:23.200\nchange management works and\nhow we manage that entire process.\n\n652\n00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.900\nThat's really what we're trying to say.\n\n653\n00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.030\nRonnie, again, great job.\n\n654\n00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.110\nI think you did a fantastic\neffort on that.\n\n655\n00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:29.910\nAnd we appreciate you stopping by today.\n\n656\n00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:32.080\nBut it looks like we've come to\nthe end of yet another great show.\n\n657\n00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.780\nHopefully you guys got a lot out of it.\n\n658\n00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:35.180\nMaybe even learned something.\n\n659\n00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.350\nThat being said,\nwe're gonna sign off for ITProTV.\n\n660\n00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:38.569\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n661\n00:33:38.569 --> 00:33:39.451\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n662\n00:33:39.451 --> 00:33:41.168\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n663\n00:33:41.168 --> 00:33:49.150\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

They begin by re-visiting the project phases of execution and monitoring as well as the triple constraints. They also introduce you to the 3 project killers, inadequate planning, poor risk planning, and lack of change process. Finally they use scenarios to explain how deviations in any one area of the triple constraints will affect the others.",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.812 --> 00:00:19.752\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode that's right,\n\n4\n00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:21.814\nwe're continuing on with\nour Project+ Series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.814 --> 00:00:25.289\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto help us in that very endeavor is our\n\n6\n00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.274\ngood friend and mentor, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:27.274 --> 00:00:28.524\nRonnie, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n8\n00:00:28.524 --> 00:00:30.170\n>> Well, thank you for\nhaving me back on the show.\n\n9\n00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.570\nAs we continue on taking\na look at CompTIA's Project+.\n\n10\n00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.907\nToday, what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna focus in on those triple\n\n11\n00:00:36.907 --> 00:00:37.967\nconstraints again.\n\n12\n00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:42.370\nThat really do allow us to manage our\nproject and really do hold our project to,\n\n13\n00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.119\nwell, at least three different fires,\nright?\n\n14\n00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:47.131\nTo keep us on track for what we need.\n\n15\n00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:51.320\nSo we need to take a look at that process\nand see what happens in a scenario basis\n\n16\n00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.553\nhere when we actually\noveremphasize one versus the other.\n\n17\n00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:59.016\nNow the reason why this is important\nduring the execution phase is because it\n\n18\n00:00:59.016 --> 00:01:02.152\nmeans we need to keep on track\nof all three of these, or\n\n19\n00:01:02.152 --> 00:01:06.009\nwe are gonna find ourselves behind\nthe 8 ball on any one of these.\n\n20\n00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.200\nAnd it's gonna actually be very\ndifficult to get back on track.\n\n21\n00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.000\nSo, let's go ahead with a little bit of\na review process that will get us started.\n\n22\n00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.850\nAnd then we'll actually\nsee what will happen.\n\n23\n00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.260\nOkay, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my machine.\n\n24\n00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.840\nAs we have been from\nthe very beginning and\n\n25\n00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.970\nduring the pre-project setup phase, right?\n\n26\n00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.510\nWe kind of took a look at\nthis in earlier episodes\n\n27\n00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.940\nwhere we went over this diagram\nat least three or four times.\n\n28\n00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.580\nAnd then I've tried to do this\non every phase at least once.\n\n29\n00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.210\nSo in the initiation we hit it just about\nevery time we talked about it here,\n\n30\n00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.570\nwhere we went over this process, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.240\nAnd then during the planning,\nI hit it at least at the beginning and\n\n32\n00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.060\nthen at the end of the planning stage.\n\n33\n00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.680\nAnd now we're in this execution and\nmonitoring phase as well, and so\n\n34\n00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.190\nwe'll actually take this\nopportunity to hit it once more.\n\n35\n00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.340\nAnd then we'll see it at the end as well.\n\n36\n00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.040\nOkay, so\nremember that every project essentially\n\n37\n00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.970\ngoes through five different phases here,\nright?\n\n38\n00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.300\nSo the initiation of course is\nthe pre-project setup that allows us to\n\n39\n00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.690\nget started.\n\n40\n00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.810\nAnd the outcome of that is gonna be our\nproject charter, that sign that tells us\n\n41\n00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.400\nthat we're authorize to begin\nthe project and the planning of it too.\n\n42\n00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.810\nDuring the planning stages\nwhen we go ahead and\n\n43\n00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.450\nbefore any money is actually spent\non any activity in our project.\n\n44\n00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.030\nWe are planning this out so\n\n45\n00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.990\nthat we can manage the project better from\nevery aspect that we can think about here.\n\n46\n00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.430\nWe'll actually take a look at those\ndifferent plans that we come up with,\n\n47\n00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.250\nfrom risk management to time and to cost\nmanagement to human resource management,\n\n48\n00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.680\nyou name it, procurement.\n\n49\n00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.520\nWe actually went through a lot of\ndifferent plans there as well.\n\n50\n00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.482\nAnd once our planning is done at the end,\n\n51\n00:02:43.482 --> 00:02:47.501\nwe also talked about the idea\nof a planned transition.\n\n52\n00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:50.875\nThat allows us to hand over to the next\nphase in our project as well as\n\n53\n00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:55.339\nactually say hey, once we're actually done\nwith the planning and the entire project,\n\n54\n00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:59.040\nwe also need to turn this over to\noperations of some sort as well.\n\n55\n00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.095\nAnd this is where we go into execution and\nmonitoring and controlling.\n\n56\n00:03:03.095 --> 00:03:07.310\nAnd even though we talk about it in order\nof initiation, planning, execution, and\n\n57\n00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.820\nthen we'll go onto monitoring and\ncontrolling here.\n\n58\n00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.970\nAnd then we'll talk about the idea\nof closing at some point.\n\n59\n00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.110\nWell, in reality,\nexecution and monitoring and\n\n60\n00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.810\ncontrolling are happening simultaneously.\n\n61\n00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.770\nBut since we can't talk\nsimultaneously to ensure that happens,\n\n62\n00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.340\nwe have to cover them one\nafter the other sequentially.\n\n63\n00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.110\nAnd of course, closing out and saying\nthat we're done with our project and\n\n64\n00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.090\nwe're now ready to hand the project\noff somewhere along the line, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.190\nSo remember that those phases\nare actually very important for us.\n\n66\n00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.360\nEverything that we're doing in execution,\n\n67\n00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.690\nright, is really carrying out what\nwe actually have from planning.\n\n68\n00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.240\nAnd verifying that our project,\n\n69\n00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.820\nas we actually are working, that we're\nworking it according to the project plan.\n\n70\n00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.770\nSo, our project plan, essentially, is the\nmain and the primary guidance that you and\n\n71\n00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.080\nI will have to ensure that\nthe project continues to progress\n\n72\n00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.540\nthe way that we need to,\nas we monitor, and control.\n\n73\n00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.880\nOkay, and this is where what we're\ngonna be talking about today really\n\n74\n00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.030\nis starting to really kind\nof mesh into the execution\n\n75\n00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.140\nis to insure that we stay on top of\nwhat we call the triple constraints.\n\n76\n00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.220\nRemember that every single project that\nyou end up working on, okay, are going to\n\n77\n00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.362\nbe essentially balances of what we\ncall quality, schedule and resource.\n\n78\n00:04:21.362 --> 00:04:25.788\nActually as cost, scope and time\nmanagement is the way that I learned it.\n\n79\n00:04:25.788 --> 00:04:30.180\nIn CompTIA, you may actually hear\na couple of different variations of them.\n\n80\n00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.760\nLike quality, schedule, and resources.\n\n81\n00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.100\nWhatever it might be, right, you'll learn\nit in your way, in your fashion here.\n\n82\n00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.170\nBut all three of these need\nto always be kept in balance.\n\n83\n00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.510\nThe over emphasis of one of these always\nbrings a constraint on the other two.\n\n84\n00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.290\nSo you do have to actually deal with that,\nand\n\n85\n00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.360\nthat's what we're gonna be\nfocusing in on when we take a look\n\n86\n00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.820\nat the scenarios that we're gonna\nbe taking a look at as well.\n\n87\n00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.930\nNow, even though I tend to draw this in\na triangle, at the points of the triangle,\n\n88\n00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.500\nthe majority of the time when you\nsee this diagram, they actually\n\n89\n00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.810\nmove these things over to the sides\nas what they end up doing instead.\n\n90\n00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.220\nSo you may actually see\nit written like this and\n\n91\n00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.140\nthe reason why is that we\nemphasize one side of it, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.399\nWell, the other sides are actually what\ngets affected as the way they have it.\n\n93\n00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.907\nI just like doing the points\non the triangle because\n\n94\n00:05:18.907 --> 00:05:20.630\nit makes more sense to me.\n\n95\n00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.480\nThat I actually emphasize one and then\nthe other two points are actually the ones\n\n96\n00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.851\nthat actually get affected by it as well,\nokay?\n\n97\n00:05:26.851 --> 00:05:30.246\nSo that is the key for us is that we wanna\nmake sure that all three of these are in\n\n98\n00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:34.197\nbalance, because they are what we call the\ntriple constraints of project management.\n\n99\n00:05:34.197 --> 00:05:38.249\nAnd they all what we have to deal\nwith when we start taking a look,\n\n100\n00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:42.830\nespecially as the progress on\nyour project continues forward.\n\n101\n00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.120\nSo, at least memorize this,\nif nothing else at this point,\n\n102\n00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.300\nmemorize this, but then to put it to\npractical application, we're gonna take\n\n103\n00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.870\na look at some of the different\nscenarios that we've talked about, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.540\nNow, before we move into that, okay,\n\n105\n00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.890\nthe key here in the execution and\nbeing able to complete\n\n106\n00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:08.680\nthe execution successfully goes really\ninto the planning stage of what we have.\n\n107\n00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.330\nAnd this is where we actually have to be\ncareful, because it's during the execution\n\n108\n00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.060\npart that things can fall\napart rather quickly, right?\n\n109\n00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.050\nAs things are not executed well,\n\n110\n00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.310\nin other words, executed poorly,\nyour project can go south very quickly.\n\n111\n00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.400\nAs your resources abandon you,\n\n112\n00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.080\nin other words, they don't actually see\nyou as being the project manager and\n\n113\n00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.540\nthe team lead, they stop following you,\nyour project goes down immediately.\n\n114\n00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.210\nYou lose your sponsorship.\n\n115\n00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.990\nIt again goes down.\n\n116\n00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.151\nSo how do you keep this up?\n\n117\n00:06:37.151 --> 00:06:41.489\nWell, there's three sure fire what we\ncall project killers that are actually\n\n118\n00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:42.154\nout there.\n\n119\n00:06:42.154 --> 00:06:45.679\nIn other words,\nthese are constant threats that you and\n\n120\n00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:49.654\nI have to deal with that if we\ndon't actually give enough time to\n\n121\n00:06:49.654 --> 00:06:55.010\nthem inside of the planning phase,\nwe're gonna see our project fail, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.720\nSo if you take a look at the idea\nof those triple constraints again,\n\n123\n00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.910\nrealize that we also take a look at\nthe idea of some other constraints here.\n\n124\n00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.250\nAnd we talked about the idea of planning,\nokay?\n\n125\n00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.320\nAnd it all has to do it inadequate or lack\nof planning is what we're talking about.\n\n126\n00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.200\nSo let me see if I can do this.\n\n127\n00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.602\nSo I'm gonna bring up just\nanother document here and\n\n128\n00:07:13.602 --> 00:07:15.251\nwe'll just type these things out.\n\n129\n00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:17.631\nSo, three project killers to keep in mind.\n\n130\n00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:21.039\nLet me change the color here and\n\n131\n00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:27.078\nthat will make a little bit easier and\nthe size of this.\n\n132\n00:07:27.078 --> 00:07:31.883\nSo, project killer number one, oops,\nnow let's see if I can actually drag\n\n133\n00:07:31.883 --> 00:07:36.100\nthat out just a little bit more,\nis gonna be inadequate planning.\n\n134\n00:07:40.185 --> 00:07:43.086\nOkay, most of the time when\nyou are a project manager and\n\n135\n00:07:43.086 --> 00:07:44.640\nyou're actually good at it.\n\n136\n00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.655\nYou just simply pull out\nanother project plan.\n\n137\n00:07:46.655 --> 00:07:50.453\nAnd most of your time, you can actually\nuse that to essentially kind of be\n\n138\n00:07:50.453 --> 00:07:54.437\na fairly good guideline for you to at\nleast get the project started in terms of\n\n139\n00:07:54.437 --> 00:07:58.671\nthe execution part when you need to And it\nreally does give you a head start because\n\n140\n00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:01.661\nif you're actually good\nmanaging one time per project,\n\n141\n00:08:01.661 --> 00:08:05.394\nmore than likely, the next one that\nyou're gonna go on is not gonna be so\n\n142\n00:08:05.394 --> 00:08:09.240\ndifferent that you're not gonna be\nable to learn from the previous one.\n\n143\n00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.720\nBut the problem that we have\nis we're novice at this.\n\n144\n00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.370\nWe need to spend as much time as\nwe can in the planning, right?\n\n145\n00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.840\nMake sure that we cover\nall the details necessary.\n\n146\n00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.020\nThe more time that you spend in planning,\n\n147\n00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.240\nthe more likely that your project is\ngoing to be carried off successfully.\n\n148\n00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.930\nNow the other one that we can also\ntake a look at as far as the idea of\n\n149\n00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:36.690\npoor types of planning goes,\nis Poor Risk Planning as well.\n\n150\n00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.910\nSo, that is another project type of\nkiller that will also bring us down.\n\n151\n00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:46.230\nJust as quickly as us not\nbalancing the project constraints,\n\n152\n00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.300\nwe need to actually take a look\nat the idea of our risk planning.\n\n153\n00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.490\nIs it adequate?\n\n154\n00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:54.360\nDid we actually think about the risk\nthat actually can hit our project?\n\n155\n00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.150\nOr are we just saying that hey,\n\n156\n00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.300\nwe're gonna deal with the risk in\none particular way or fashion?\n\n157\n00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.840\nSo if you're not sure about that,\nmake sure you go and\n\n158\n00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.840\ncheck out the Risk Planning,\n\n159\n00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:09.260\nthe management of Risk Planning\nthat we also did in that episode.\n\n160\n00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.300\nAnd then our last one here is\ngonna be Lack of Change Process.\n\n161\n00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:22.450\nSo if we do not have a formal process for\nthis, changes will absolutely dominate our\n\n162\n00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.030\nproject and\nwe will not be able to control them.\n\n163\n00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.215\nSo the key here right?\n\n164\n00:09:27.215 --> 00:09:31.390\nIn everything that we're saying is control\nis the key for a successful project.\n\n165\n00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:35.770\nAnd you as a project you're essentially\nmust keep on top of these project killers\n\n166\n00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.470\nor they will get you and\n\n167\n00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:41.260\nthat's something you just don't want\nto actually have happening to you here.\n\n168\n00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.980\nAnd let me change this up here.\n\n169\n00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.080\nThree project killers, okay?\n\n170\n00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.540\nNow, why are these actual project killers?\n\n171\n00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:53.570\nAnd that is because they all have\nwhat we call high probability and\n\n172\n00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:58.280\nhigh impact on your overall project,\nitself, okay?\n\n173\n00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.220\nThe very fact is,\n\n174\n00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:03.870\nlack of planning is going to be\na high probability on your end.\n\n175\n00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.790\nAnd the impact of that unless should\nmake you have to manage the project much\n\n176\n00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.570\nharder than you think.\n\n177\n00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.920\nWhen you don't take the considerate\ntime in risk planning here.\n\n178\n00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.670\nOkay.\n\n179\n00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.700\nAny one risk can drive you down and then\nwhen you don't have a change process and\n\n180\n00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.930\nyou can't manage them,\n\n181\n00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:23.390\nthat again is actually high because\nchanges happen constantly on your project.\n\n182\n00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:27.270\nRisks are things that you should again\nbe able to control a little bit.\n\n183\n00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.230\nIf you at least have a risk register,\n\n184\n00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:32.850\ninadequate planning is not something\nyou can overcome very easily.\n\n185\n00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:34.250\nSo you have to deal with that,\n\n186\n00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:38.820\nwith those as being facts on your\nproject just in the same way\n\n187\n00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:43.640\nthat these are also essentially\nfacts on your project as well, okay?\n\n188\n00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.220\nSo, since we're really focusing in on this\nbut I wanted to bring that in because it's\n\n189\n00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.630\nactually a part of something that we\ndon't consider in terms of constraints\n\n190\n00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:56.400\nthose are also kind of unspoken types of\nconstraints that we have to worry about.\n\n191\n00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.720\nAll right, so what happens if\nwe center in around the idea of\n\n192\n00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.980\ncost instead of everything else, okay?\n\n193\n00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.490\nSo I went ahead and\nbrought up this scenario.\n\n194\n00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:09.760\nAnd then what we're gonna talk about,\nright, is that if we actually\n\n195\n00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.290\nfocus in on the cost itself,\nwhat's actually gonna be affected is what?\n\n196\n00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.600\nIs essentially the equality right?\n\n197\n00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.000\nThe idea of my requirements for\n\n198\n00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.430\nmy equality as well as the idea\nof the schedule here, okay?\n\n199\n00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:26.280\nSo in this scenario,\nlet me zoom in a little bit,\n\n200\n00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:31.620\nokay, you're into the execution monitoring\nand controlling phase of your project.\n\n201\n00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.000\nThe project is progressing as\nplanned as far as the schedule and\n\n202\n00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.370\nthe scope goes, okay?\n\n203\n00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.970\nYou did spend though, a little bit more in\ngetting started with the project than you\n\n204\n00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:46.840\nthought, than you expected, and\nyou have no contingency left and\n\n205\n00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.580\nyet the project still needs\nto cut costs where possible.\n\n206\n00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:55.910\nHow is this gonna essentially impact your\nschedule and the scope of your project?\n\n207\n00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.270\nSo when you take a look at what you're\ngiven in this particular scenario here,\n\n208\n00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:03.150\nright, we are pretty much told\nthat we are well now into it.\n\n209\n00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.510\nBut what we did is that, at the beginning\nof the project, we did what?\n\n210\n00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:08.000\nWe spent too much money, so\n\n211\n00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.010\nmuch so that even our contingency\nreserve is gone, okay?\n\n212\n00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:16.610\nAnd that now means I have to do what\nwith the rest of the money that's left?\n\n213\n00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.520\nI really have to start cutting corners,\n\n214\n00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.590\nand start making sure that everything\nis actually down to the t, or\n\n215\n00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:27.750\nmy project is really going to actually\nstart suffering in other areas.\n\n216\n00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.550\nAnd here, they're specifically\nasking about the schedule\n\n217\n00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.770\nas well as the scope is what\nwe wanna take a look at, okay?\n\n218\n00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:41.090\nSo, if I now focus in then on\njust the idea of cost, well how\n\n219\n00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:47.750\ndoes that affect my schedule at this point\nin the project among a ready well into it?\n\n220\n00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.360\nWell think about what happens\nto your schedule, right?\n\n221\n00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:54.040\nNow I'm saying here's the amount\nof money that's left.\n\n222\n00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.560\nI'm going to ensure then,\nthat what will happen when my schedule\n\n223\n00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:02.790\nis that everything I can is actually\ngonna happen as fast as possible.\n\n224\n00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:07.160\nNot exactly a bad idea, but when we\nstart actually doing stuff like that,\n\n225\n00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:12.830\nespecially with the idea of our,\nwhat are resources here, okay.\n\n226\n00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.640\nWhat we'll end up doing is that\nnow that the contingency is gone,\n\n227\n00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.710\nis that we might find out\nwe don't have room for\n\n228\n00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:22.240\nthings like overtime that we\nactually will spend, okay?\n\n229\n00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.830\nSo in other words,\nwe might actually say, look,\n\n230\n00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:28.440\nthe project as far as my schedule goes\nmeans because I do not have money to go\n\n231\n00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.350\nover into the overtime, the schedule will\nget extended out further than I thought.\n\n232\n00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:38.050\nSo that's a very real possible scenario\nthat can happen just from this one and\n\n233\n00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.150\napparently I actually reordered them.\n\n234\n00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:41.760\nI didn't realize when I\nwas moving stuff around.\n\n235\n00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.260\nBut this will actually work.\n\n236\n00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.050\nSo in the schedule here that's what will\nhappen is that the schedule may be pushed\n\n237\n00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:48.220\nout in that way.\n\n238\n00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.640\nWhen we don't have all the resources that\nwe have, that we need available here, so\n\n239\n00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.780\nwe might find out that without the idea of\nbeing able to do overtime, without that,\n\n240\n00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.740\nit will push our schedule out\na little bit further, okay?\n\n241\n00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:05.700\nIf not, what may also happen then\nis that if we're still also given\n\n242\n00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:10.960\nthe idea that the project scope, we have\nto actually maintain and figure out here.\n\n243\n00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.610\nIs that with the cost of that,\n\n244\n00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.920\nwe may actually have to reduce\nthe project scope as well.\n\n245\n00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:20.550\nWe may end up finding out\nthat because we actually\n\n246\n00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:25.010\nhave impacted the scope itself, we may\nfind out we can't get the deliverable\n\n247\n00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.220\nall the considerate time that it needs.\n\n248\n00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.900\nSo we start cutting corners\na little bit which now means\n\n249\n00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:33.730\neither the deliverable itself at the end\nproduct is not gonna be what we want.\n\n250\n00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.250\nOr we're gonna cut corners to the point\n\n251\n00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:40.310\nin which it is gonna make it as it's\nunsafe for the entire project as well.\n\n252\n00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:45.280\nSo there are actual risks that are\ninvolved when you start to take a look at\n\n253\n00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.350\nwhat happens when you over focus on one\nand you don't keep them in balance.\n\n254\n00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:53.650\nSo just remember that when you focus in\non the cost itself, your schedule and\n\n255\n00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:57.670\nyour scope is also going to be\nimpacted when you take a look there.\n\n256\n00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:02.610\nSo, very interesting that you have\nto actually look at it kind of from\n\n257\n00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:08.640\nthe opposite perspective here in terms\nof just focusing in on cost itself.\n\n258\n00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.640\nCost is usually the biggest one\nthat we focus in on because\n\n259\n00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.540\nthat's the one that drains the fastest,\nright?\n\n260\n00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:16.850\nWhen you realize you don't have enough\nmoney to finish, that's when you start\n\n261\n00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.890\nlaying people off, you start trying to cut\ntime, you start doing this but that means\n\n262\n00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:26.050\nthat either people will actually end\nup getting more work for less money and\n\n263\n00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:30.320\nthey're not actually happy any more and\nthey're willing to sacrifice other things.\n\n264\n00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.010\nSo you gotta actually be\na little bit wary about this.\n\n265\n00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:37.120\nBut the key on the project\nmanagement is that you realize that.\n\n266\n00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.650\nCuz if you realize that,\nthat means you can actually try now for\n\n267\n00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.850\nsome actions that will try and\nbring everything back into focus.\n\n268\n00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:44.410\n>> Yeah.\n\n269\n00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:45.640\nNow it's an easy thing to do.\n\n270\n00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.350\nYou think I've got all this money.\n\n271\n00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:49.020\nIt's gonna be, that's fine.\n\n272\n00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.190\nWe've done all of the planning\nthat we need to do.\n\n273\n00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:53.178\nAnd again we go back to\nour three project killers.\n\n274\n00:15:53.178 --> 00:15:55.154\nMaybe you didn't plan quite properly and\n\n275\n00:15:55.154 --> 00:15:57.421\nthat's when you run into\nscenarios like this.\n\n276\n00:15:57.421 --> 00:16:02.344\nYou spent too much money, you have little\nless and now starting to impact both\n\n277\n00:16:02.344 --> 00:16:03.868\nschedule And or your\n>> Scope\n\n278\n00:16:03.868 --> 00:16:04.611\n>> Scope.\n\n279\n00:16:04.611 --> 00:16:07.560\nYour quality of the product\nyou're trying to produce.\n\n280\n00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:12.550\nSo you got to keep an eye on that but\nanyone of these tips of this\n\n281\n00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:16.480\ntriangle iceberg as it were could cause\na problem as well if you don't plan and\n\n282\n00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.680\ndo things correctly you can go\nright into the time and schedule.\n\n283\n00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.390\nMaybe you do that wrong.\n\n284\n00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:23.290\nWhy don't you also have\na scenario set up for\n\n285\n00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.460\nus where we've planned\nthat in properly as well?\n\n286\n00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:25.990\n>> We really do.\n\n287\n00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:27.680\nLet's take a look at the scenario here.\n\n288\n00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.180\nI've went ahead and\n\n289\n00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.940\njust listed out because you may see\nsomething fairly similar to this as well.\n\n290\n00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.430\nThe Project Charter has now been approved.\n\n291\n00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.070\nYou're now well into the planning\nstage of your project.\n\n292\n00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.990\nYou've been called to\na stakeholder meeting that lets\n\n293\n00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:43.340\nyou know that the project\ndeadline has been moved up.\n\n294\n00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.410\nShortening the time that you\nhave to complete the project.\n\n295\n00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:50.140\nHow does this immediately\nimpact the project itself?\n\n296\n00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.310\nWell, remember that we're looking\nat the triple constraints, then.\n\n297\n00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:56.740\nThat means that any time that we actually\naffect, let's say, the schedule and\n\n298\n00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:01.210\ntime, that means we have to consider\nwhat will happen to the scope, and\n\n299\n00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:04.480\nnow the actual cost of the project itself.\n\n300\n00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.760\nIs what we actually have to think\nabout when we start taking a look\n\n301\n00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.770\nat that change that ends up going on here.\n\n302\n00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:13.420\nSo let me go back to\nthe schedule change here.\n\n303\n00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.700\nAnd that's what we wanted\nto look at as well.\n\n304\n00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:20.410\nOkay, so when we start taking a look\nat the schedule and the time here.\n\n305\n00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:25.160\nAnd the impact here is remember that now\nthat The Project Charter has approved.\n\n306\n00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.640\nThe cost may also go up as well, okay?\n\n307\n00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.150\nWe have essentially shortened the overall\nduration of the entire project, and\n\n308\n00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:34.830\nnow when we take a look at the cost,\n\n309\n00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:39.720\nwhy does that actually affect\nus in terms of the cost here?\n\n310\n00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.780\nWell, it's because we're now probably\ngonna need to bring in more resources\n\n311\n00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.500\nto complete more work, but\n\n312\n00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:49.440\nin a shorter amount of time is\nwhat we're taking a look at.\n\n313\n00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.530\nSo, the more work that's, actually,\ncompleted in a short amount of time, means\n\n314\n00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:57.200\nwe're gonna be able to spend more money\nfaster is what will also end up happening.\n\n315\n00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:02.540\nThe added pressure also, because you're,\nactually, on a shortened time duration\n\n316\n00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:08.010\nwill also end up impacting us as well too\nis that what we may end up finding out,\n\n317\n00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:12.840\nright, is that we're gonna get delayed at\ncertain points that we didn't realise that\n\n318\n00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.880\nwould actually get delayed because\nof the way that the schedule is and\n\n319\n00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.960\nbecause of the way that the cost\nis actually running as well.\n\n320\n00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:25.330\nSo you gotta actually pay attention there\nin terms of the scope itself, right?\n\n321\n00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.730\nThat if it's actually\nmoved up significantly.\n\n322\n00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.320\nIn other words,\ntime has moved forward significantly.\n\n323\n00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.350\nYou may find out that you really\njust don't have the time to complete\n\n324\n00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.110\nthe overall project.\n\n325\n00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:39.530\nAnd you may actually have to settle for\nactually doing another project or\n\n326\n00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:41.830\nmaybe not even starting at all.\n\n327\n00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:46.020\nSo this is where you go into that\nphase gate type of situation and\n\n328\n00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.520\ntake a look too.\n\n329\n00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.080\nIs that if they want that same\nscope to actually be there,\n\n330\n00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.450\nthey really do have to compensate by\nactually sending you much more money so\n\n331\n00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:59.690\nthat you can get people to commit to\ndoing overtime if they need to or\n\n332\n00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:02.970\ncommit to actually getting\nmore people onto the project.\n\n333\n00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.310\nTo work the way that we need as well.\n\n334\n00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:10.300\nSo any one of those folks essentially\nimpacts those other two once again.\n\n335\n00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:14.670\nSo just make sure you pay attention and\nthat's what we're taking a look at.\n\n336\n00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.820\nA lot of this is logical,\nit actually does make sense, but\n\n337\n00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.150\ngoing through these scenarios\nis really going to help us out\n\n338\n00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:23.290\nbecause we can understand\nit a little bit better.\n\n339\n00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.360\nSo Daniel, essentially that leads\nus to our last issue there,\n\n340\n00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.270\nwhich is actually what happens\nwhen the scope changes.\n\n341\n00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:34.890\nSo let's take a look at that,\nlet me see if actually, there we go.\n\n342\n00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:36.890\nYep, that's the one that I want.\n\n343\n00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:41.130\nSo I mislabeled my tabs is why I'm\nhaving a little problem doing this here.\n\n344\n00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:44.110\nSo I actually have two as\nschedule changes here.\n\n345\n00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:49.530\nAll right, so when we take a look\nat focusing in on the scope.\n\n346\n00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:53.830\nWith the current project,\nchanges have been managed well so far.\n\n347\n00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:54.350\nOkay?\n\n348\n00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:58.780\nThe current change request adds some\nadditional requirements to the scope.\n\n349\n00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:02.060\nThe Change Control Board\nwants to understand from you,\n\n350\n00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:06.050\nthe Project Manager, what will be\nthe impact on the schedule and\n\n351\n00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:11.650\nthe cost to implement these particular\nchanges that are actually before you.\n\n352\n00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:15.530\nSo you may also end up seeing this, that\nwhat ends up happening is that everything\n\n353\n00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:19.690\nwas approved as far as the changes go,\nbut they really now, after saying, look,\n\n354\n00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:20.600\nthat's a great change.\n\n355\n00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.200\nThat's something that needs to be done,\nlet's go ahead and do it.\n\n356\n00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.920\nEven with some of the impact analysis\nhere, they may not understand what it\n\n357\n00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:31.380\nreally does to the overall project\nto self in terms of cost okay, and\n\n358\n00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.110\nwhat it does to the schedule.\n\n359\n00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:36.640\nSo sometimes the idea of\nimproving on the overall project,\n\n360\n00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.890\nthey don't take that into consideration.\n\n361\n00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:42.740\nWell if you're gonna add in more\nadditional requirements then to the scope\n\n362\n00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:43.920\nof the project then,\n\n363\n00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.980\nyou gotta realize that your schedule is\nessentially going to be extended out.\n\n364\n00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.150\nNow, if it actually gets extended\nout at that particular point,\n\n365\n00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:56.600\nright, well, that's fine, as long as\neverybody is willing to deal with it, too.\n\n366\n00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.940\nBut what you're gonna also end\nup seeing sometimes, though,\n\n367\n00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.507\nas you are actually with the current\nproject, and now changes are coming about,\n\n368\n00:21:03.507 --> 00:21:07.250\nwhat if you're ready to release\nproject team members to go and\n\n369\n00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:11.570\ndo something else and now such as\nyou're calling them to come back in.\n\n370\n00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:15.830\nThey could actually end up renegotiating\nat a new price if they wanted to and\n\n371\n00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:19.530\nactually kick your cost up just\na little bit more as well.\n\n372\n00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:23.780\nAlso, if you're calling them back\nin as far as your schedule goes\n\n373\n00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:27.290\nwhat if they tell you that they\ncan't do it until a particular date?\n\n374\n00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:30.320\nNow you also have to deal with\nthe idea of date constraints,\n\n375\n00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.690\ntoo, to know where you're actually\npushing the schedule out even further.\n\n376\n00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.850\nThe other thing, again,\nis that idea of cost.\n\n377\n00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:41.760\nIf you try and say look, we can still\ndo this, we just need more people, or\n\n378\n00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.520\nwe need more equipment, well, again,\nthose costs are gonna rise for\n\n379\n00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.510\nyou on the entire schedule itself,\non the entire project itself.\n\n380\n00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:52.790\nAnd that means that you do actually\nhave to account for that, too.\n\n381\n00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:56.570\nSo, in any factor that we've\ntaken a look at this, right,\n\n382\n00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:01.140\nyou do actually have to think out what is\nactually going to be impacted, and then\n\n383\n00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:05.810\nyou as a project manager, realizing that,\nhow do you account for that situation?\n\n384\n00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:08.950\nSo that's what we've tried to lead\nyou through on these particular\n\n385\n00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:09.890\nscenarios here.\n\n386\n00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.280\nWe didn't get super in depth on them,\n\n387\n00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.930\nbecause every situation is\ngoing to be a little different.\n\n388\n00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.890\nWe just tried to show you that if you\nimpact one, by changing something,\n\n389\n00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:22.830\nthat means the other two are going to\nface the burden of that in your project.\n\n390\n00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.420\nAnd you as a project\nmanager need to know that.\n\n391\n00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.086\nIf you go,\nI don't have a clue what are the facts.\n\n392\n00:22:29.086 --> 00:22:33.080\nThen you're not actually following\nthe idea of understanding anything about\n\n393\n00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.240\nproject management.\n\n394\n00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.770\nIf you had an impact to your schedule,\nyou've got to know that it affects what,\n\n395\n00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.690\nyour costs and your scope.\n\n396\n00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:40.870\nIt's just going to.\n\n397\n00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:44.260\nWhat impacts your costs is gonna affect\nyour what, your schedule, and your scope.\n\n398\n00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.860\nIf it impacts your scope time.\n\n399\n00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:50.970\nI know there's a schedule,\nas well as the idea of your cost.\n\n400\n00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:54.480\nSo just kind of realize that\nthat's the key behind this, and\n\n401\n00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.330\nit's nothing that we\nhaven't reviewed before.\n\n402\n00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.390\nThis time,\nwe just added in some scenarios to try and\n\n403\n00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.120\nhelp you to think it\nout a little bit more.\n\n404\n00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.000\n>> Yeah, and Ronnie,\n\n405\n00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.820\nit's funny that it seems it impacts\nall of those triple constraints.\n\n406\n00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:07.430\nNegatively.\n\n407\n00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:10.370\n>> Right.\n>> I can't think of any scenario in which\n\n408\n00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:14.220\nit would be a positive impact\nunless it's just fortuitous.\n\n409\n00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:17.170\n>> Yeah, there's sometimes it can be.\n\n410\n00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:22.140\nBut that's where you have to actually\ntake a look at that sort of things.\n\n411\n00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.470\nCuz sometimes let's say\nthat you go all right,\n\n412\n00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:29.170\nI'm glad that it impacts my time let's\nthat what I end up doing here is we affect\n\n413\n00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:33.970\nthe overall project cost itself, and\nwe say we're going to reduce it.\n\n414\n00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:35.430\nAnd what does somebody do?\n\n415\n00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:36.800\nThey double up on the work.\n\n416\n00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:41.850\nAnd all of the sudden they double up\non the work and now you've gained 2 or\n\n417\n00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:42.860\n3 days extra.\n\n418\n00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:43.950\nAnd you say wow that's cool.\n\n419\n00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:45.460\nI need to do that.\n\n420\n00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.860\nBut, what did they compromise to do that.\n\n421\n00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.450\nIt could be the quality,\nthat's the problem, right,\n\n422\n00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:52.828\nis that they cut a little\nbit of corners doing that.\n\n423\n00:23:52.828 --> 00:23:55.990\nOr, they just said, that's good enough,\nwhen what you, actually,\n\n424\n00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:58.851\nneeded was something that met\nthose metric standards instead.\n\n425\n00:23:58.851 --> 00:23:59.492\nSo, they're, it's okay.\n\n426\n00:23:59.492 --> 00:24:03.811\nIt's a little bit under what my quality\nmetrics are And they'll do that.\n\n427\n00:24:03.811 --> 00:24:07.389\nAnd so, even though there are some\nbenefits to that, you have to worry,\n\n428\n00:24:07.389 --> 00:24:10.610\nthe money is the way that you\nnormally gage that, right?\n\n429\n00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:15.020\nIf you, actually, plan out everything in\nyour project, and you say it's gonna be\n\n430\n00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:19.180\n55, or $5,500 to complete this work\npackage, and now somebody hands you\n\n431\n00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:23.710\neverything, and it came out to be $4,200,\nyou might be going, yes, I saved $1,000.\n\n432\n00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:25.670\nWell, why?\n\n433\n00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:28.420\nDid they decide to buy\nsubstandard material?\n\n434\n00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.203\nDid they choose to not make\nas many as they needed to?\n\n435\n00:24:32.203 --> 00:24:36.140\nDid they actually complete\neverything that we required of them?\n\n436\n00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:36.720\nWhat is it?\n\n437\n00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.800\nIt wasn't just the fact\nthat you saved time, but\n\n438\n00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.990\nif you saved time and\nmoney you really do need to look at both.\n\n439\n00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.470\nAnd all of us want to save time and\nmoney, and\n\n440\n00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:46.800\nwe all think that that's\nthe greatest thing in the world.\n\n441\n00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.980\nUntil you actually look\nat that work package and\n\n442\n00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.110\nyou now do a better analysis of it.\n\n443\n00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:53.450\nAnd all of a sudden you find out,\n\n444\n00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.610\nthey didn't use the contractor that\nyou said they were supposed to use.\n\n445\n00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:00.140\nThey didn't actually do these things\nexactly the way that you wanted them to be\n\n446\n00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.670\ndone, and now what has to happen?\n\n447\n00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:05.492\nThat whole process might now have to be,\nwhat?\n\n448\n00:25:05.492 --> 00:25:08.228\nYou know, rerun again, and so,\nnow you've, actually, paid for\n\n449\n00:25:08.228 --> 00:25:09.900\nthat whole process twice.\n\n450\n00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.880\nSo, [LAUGH] you will,\nactually, end up paying for\n\n451\n00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.460\nit in some way,\neven though you think that, no,\n\n452\n00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.210\nthat's a positive influence to something\nlike this, if we were to do that.\n\n453\n00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:23.470\nAnd in the end though, sometimes you\ndo have to cut the scope at times,\n\n454\n00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:26.660\nwhen you realize you're not gonna actually\nbe able to complete the entire project.\n\n455\n00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:30.270\nBut you can complete 90% of it, and\nyou wanna let them know that, look,\n\n456\n00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:33.510\nwe can complete 90%, and\nthat doesn't make you a failure,\n\n457\n00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:37.120\nit just says look, here's 10%,\nhere's what I need to finish it.\n\n458\n00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.440\nBut at least 90% of the project got done,\nand so,\n\n459\n00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:45.240\nif not, you can actually mark that as\nbeing a project failure even at 90% here.\n\n460\n00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:48.600\nSo yeah, when it comes out to\nat least these, when we actually\n\n461\n00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:53.700\nchoose to follow one over the other, we're\nalways gonna see it as a negative impact\n\n462\n00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:58.290\neven though the immediate results\nlook positive and seem positive.\n\n463\n00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:01.910\nWhen you do an analysis you'll find out\nit really didn't become a positive for\n\n464\n00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.850\nyou, once you actually look at\nthe varied details of it, and\n\n465\n00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:08.730\nthat's what becomes scary, is because,\nit's all those shiny things.\n\n466\n00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:12.390\nIt's like, yes, we did that,\nwe saved money, and everybody's happy,\n\n467\n00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:15.570\nand then you go back and look at it and\ngo, this is why we're so happy.\n\n468\n00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:18.180\nWe really didn't actually produce\nwhat we said we were gonna produce.\n\n469\n00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.430\n>> Yeah, every now and\nthen you get lucky, right?\n\n470\n00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.600\nThings happen,\nmaybe you're a transport company and\n\n471\n00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:29.250\nyou've got a fleet of trucks and\nthe cost of oil goes down to $12 a barrel.\n\n472\n00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:30.960\nYou are saving money at that point Don,\n\n473\n00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.960\nyour cost constraints go way down,\nthat's nothing you can control.\n\n474\n00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.650\nUsually, just like Ronnie said,\npeople are kinda cutting corners,\n\n475\n00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:43.850\ninstead of using two by fours every\ntwo feet, they use it every four feet.\n\n476\n00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:45.280\n>> Right.\n>> And they save half the money, hey,\n\n477\n00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.705\nlook at me, and then the house\nfalls down and kills five people.\n\n478\n00:26:47.705 --> 00:26:48.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And now you're in front of\n\n479\n00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.381\na court somewhere cuz you're criminally\nnegligent for that kind of thing.\n\n480\n00:26:51.381 --> 00:26:52.016\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n481\n00:26:52.016 --> 00:26:55.415\nyou do need to stick to the constraints,\nand if you're gonna impact one of these\n\n482\n00:26:55.415 --> 00:26:59.280\nareas It's gonna affect the others, and\nyou gonna know how that's gonna happen.\n\n483\n00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.640\nRonnie, is there anything\nelse we want to cover for\n\n484\n00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.900\nthis episode before we wrap it up?\n\n485\n00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.320\n>> Not really, since we really did review\na lot of these concepts earlier and\n\n486\n00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:09.030\nthroughout are particularly planning and\nthen in the pre-project stages.\n\n487\n00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.180\nThere's really not a lot here, but for\n\n488\n00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:14.960\nyou as a project manager though\nis just to remember that, right?\n\n489\n00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.420\nAnd that's the key, go over more scenarios\nin your head that if you were to affect\n\n490\n00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:22.350\nthis, know what those are and try and\nfigure it out in your project.\n\n491\n00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.290\nHow would that actually end up?\n\n492\n00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:25.960\nThat's what makes you\na better project manager,\n\n493\n00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.600\nis to take a look at these things.\n\n494\n00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.720\nYou get thrown a curve ball at it,\nlet's go, okay, I need to make sure I take\n\n495\n00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.590\ncare of these areas and then get us back\non track in the way that we need to.\n\n496\n00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:35.180\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n497\n00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:35.680\nWell thank you so\n\n498\n00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:39.300\nmuch Ronnie for dropping by, and\nexplaining how things get affected.\n\n499\n00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.890\nWhen we start messing around with th\none of these three different triple\n\n500\n00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:42.910\nconstraints.\n\n501\n00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:46.510\nThat being said hopefully you guys had\na lot out of this, here episode, we're\n\n502\n00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:50.000\ngonna go ahead and wrap it up for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n503\n00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.699\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n504\n00:27:50.699 --> 00:27:52.556\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n505\n00:27:52.556 --> 00:28:00.590\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.240\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.710\nwe are continuing on with\nour project plus series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.800\nJoining us back in the studio again\ntoday to help us out with that endeavor.\n\n6\n00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.750\nLet's now listen to our good friend,\nMr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:27.970\nRonnie, welcome back sir.\n\n8\n00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.600\n>> Thank you for\n\n9\n00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.170\nhaving me back on the show as we continue\non inside of CompTIA's Project Plus.\n\n10\n00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.375\nWhat we're doing today is we're gonna take\na look of course at risk management and\n\n11\n00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:41.690\nof course the goal and the idea is\nmanaging the risk more than anything else.\n\n12\n00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.150\nIt's easy to actually take\na look at a project and\n\n13\n00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.930\nrealize that risk are always\ngoing to be there, but\n\n14\n00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.450\nwhat we wanna take a look at is\nactually that process of managing\n\n15\n00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.270\nit as we're executing, as we're actually\nmaking things happen on our project.\n\n16\n00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.830\nWhat do we do when we are actually\npresented with the idea of\n\n17\n00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.480\nrisk on our project?\n\n18\n00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.160\nAnd then of course, how do we actually\nmanage it much more effectively?\n\n19\n00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.545\nSo, when we take a look at that,\n\n20\n00:01:05.545 --> 00:01:09.000\nwe're gonna take a look at a couple of\ntools that we can use to help us out.\n\n21\n00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.010\nAnd then we're gonna kinda compare them\na little bit and that way we actually know\n\n22\n00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.840\nwhen to use them and\nwhy we actually need to use them as well.\n\n23\n00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.620\nAnd then we gonna talk about the\ndifferences between, of course, risk and\n\n24\n00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.750\nopportunities as well.\n\n25\n00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.604\nSo, let's go ahead and\n\n26\n00:01:23.604 --> 00:01:28.445\nbegin then as we start to talk\nabout the idea of managing risk.\n\n27\n00:01:28.445 --> 00:01:32.470\nThere are several processes that we can\nfollow here when we're a project manager.\n\n28\n00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.067\nSo I went ahead and\ncreated on of my simple diagrams here.\n\n29\n00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:40.154\nSome of the things that we need\nto make sure that we do hit and\n\n30\n00:01:40.154 --> 00:01:41.549\npinpoint as well, okay.\n\n31\n00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.973\nThe first thing that we want to\nmake sure that we do is to properly\n\n32\n00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:50.823\nidentify both risks and\nopportunities as they present themselves.\n\n33\n00:01:50.823 --> 00:01:55.497\nNow, this is in the same process that\nwe've also talked in the previous episode\n\n34\n00:01:55.497 --> 00:02:00.171\nabout the idea of change management, is\nnot really about the idea that risks and\n\n35\n00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:02.407\nopportunities present themselves,\n\n36\n00:02:02.407 --> 00:02:06.008\nbut it's how do we know that\nthey are actually what they are.\n\n37\n00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:08.900\nAnd how do we know that we need\nto have a response to them,\n\n38\n00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.880\nand what is that response going to be?\n\n39\n00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.320\nAnd it talks about that\nidea about actually using,\n\n40\n00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.200\nokay, this idea of a formal way to,\nof course, register them, is what we have.\n\n41\n00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.740\nAnd in our project planning,\n\n42\n00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.680\nwe took at look at the use\nof a risk register here, and\n\n43\n00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.620\nwe can also add in in that risk register\nwhat we call opportunities as well.\n\n44\n00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.230\nLet me show you an example here\nof a risk register if I can.\n\n45\n00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.490\nAnd we'll bring that one up to\nkind of help us out as well, okay?\n\n46\n00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.610\nSo, this is an ad hoc\none that I've created.\n\n47\n00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.910\nAnd I didn't actually create\nthis in the term of a form.\n\n48\n00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.680\nBut you can actually use something\nlike this or maybe even some type of\n\n49\n00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.490\na spreadsheet program to help you\nfill this out a little bit more.\n\n50\n00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.500\nSo what you might have over here on\nthe left-hand side of course is the idea\n\n51\n00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.360\nof risks.\n\n52\n00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.350\nAnd then you can even\nadd in opportunities, so\n\n53\n00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.160\nlet me just change a few of them here.\n\n54\n00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.170\nAnd I'll call this one Opp C and\nthen Opp D here instead.\n\n55\n00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.460\nNow, what is the difference?\n\n56\n00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.270\nWell, a risk normally is something that\nwe think about that actually affects us\n\n57\n00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.970\nnegatively in terms of our\nproject's progress, okay?\n\n58\n00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.760\nAn opportunity though, is something\nthat we may actually talk about as\n\n59\n00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.480\naffecting us in a positive manner instead.\n\n60\n00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.420\nSo a lot of times when we talk about\nrisk in terms of risk management, you do\n\n61\n00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.550\nhear about people talk about positive risk\nwhere they can make gains on things, and\n\n62\n00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.300\nof course, negative risks.\n\n63\n00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.290\nAnd here in CompTlA we're gonna\nkind of separate that out.\n\n64\n00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.820\nAnd talk about risk and\nopportunities instead.\n\n65\n00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.010\nThe idea of the risk register for us is\nto go ahead during our planning phase and\n\n66\n00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.470\ntry to identify every possible\nrisk that there is, and\n\n67\n00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.800\nthat way what we can do is go ahead and\nlist them out and then we try and\n\n68\n00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.480\nactually do something about probability.\n\n69\n00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.090\nIn other words,\n\n70\n00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.960\nwe make a guess here according to\na pre-determined type of scale.\n\n71\n00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.830\nBut what the likelihood of something\nhappening and then it's impact too.\n\n72\n00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.130\nAnd, the way that I have it is\nbased on a zero to one model.\n\n73\n00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.550\nYou can actually base it on\nwhatever numbers you want to.\n\n74\n00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.950\nAnd then,\nyou'll end up with a risk score to.\n\n75\n00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.710\nNow, what you may end up\ndoing at that point, is,\n\n76\n00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.350\nif you're in the planning stage,\nyou may actually say whether or\n\n77\n00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.600\nnot you need a risk response plan to it\nand who's actually gonna be responsible.\n\n78\n00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.120\nAnd you can even add in a little bit more.\n\n79\n00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.930\nBut the goal here is that if\nyou actually realize now that\n\n80\n00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.960\neven in the midst of your execution, that\nthere are other risks that are involved,\n\n81\n00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.810\nthat you update this one first to\nidentify that as a possible risk.\n\n82\n00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.890\nAnd then you actually start to\ntake a look at these things too.\n\n83\n00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.720\nSo, if you've already done\nyour pre-planning and\n\n84\n00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.720\nyou've already figured all this out,\nwe went through the process in trying to\n\n85\n00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.540\nidentify this and how you're actually\ngonna come up with a response plan and\n\n86\n00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.250\nwho is actually gonna be managing the risk\nitself in terms of risk ownership,\n\n87\n00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.140\ntoo, and then you're ready to go.\n\n88\n00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.600\nBut if it's something new,\nyou add them in and\n\n89\n00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.960\nthen you run through that same process\nagain, making sure that they're actually\n\n90\n00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.180\nclearly identified inside your\nproject plan at that point.\n\n91\n00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.738\nAnd that will help you out officially when\nyou start taking a look at identifying\n\n92\n00:04:58.738 --> 00:04:59.424\nthose two.\n\n93\n00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:04.286\nIt's when you cannot identify the risks\nand the opportunities on your project plan\n\n94\n00:05:04.286 --> 00:05:07.273\nthat either you're gonna\nwalk right in that risk or\n\n95\n00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:11.857\nyou're gonna end up missing a particular\nopportunity that may present itself\n\n96\n00:05:11.857 --> 00:05:14.101\nto you during your project planning.\n\n97\n00:05:14.101 --> 00:05:18.298\nAnd taking advantage of opportunities are\nalways things that a good project manager\n\n98\n00:05:18.298 --> 00:05:22.079\nwill do, trying to reduce the amount of\nrisk on our project is also something\n\n99\n00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:24.550\na good project manager does too.\n\n100\n00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.450\nSo, once we have now identified\nthose particular risks then,\n\n101\n00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.390\nwhat we need to do is to do\nsome basic analysis, right?\n\n102\n00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.170\nAnd this is the same thing that we did.\n\n103\n00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.830\nSo, if you wanna go back and check out,\n\n104\n00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.910\nwe did a little bit more in\ndetail during that clicker point.\n\n105\n00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.470\nAnd our planning process\ncould risk management here.\n\n106\n00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.950\nWe wanna do what we called some\ntype of a potential impact\n\n107\n00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.280\nanalysis is what we want to do.\n\n108\n00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.750\nAnd the way that project management calls\nit out is what we'll call qualitative risk\n\n109\n00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.520\nanalysis, and of course\nquantitative risk analysis as well.\n\n110\n00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.530\nWhen we start talking about\nqualitative risk analysis,\n\n111\n00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.240\nwe are trying to determine its potential\nimpact and it's probability, okay.\n\n112\n00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.110\nAnd we're essentially giving it a score or\na rating.\n\n113\n00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.810\nAnd when we do that,\nwe can actually do it on a per\n\n114\n00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.110\nwork package detail if we want to and\nanother to add that detail level.\n\n115\n00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.960\nWe can do it at the phase\nlevel if we want to and\n\n116\n00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.670\nwe can even do this at the overall\nproject level as well.\n\n117\n00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.330\nOkay, so\nin the qualitative analysis we may say,\n\n118\n00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.760\nhere's the risk of this particular\nwork package beginning late.\n\n119\n00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.800\nHere's what we actually have at finishing\non time or whatever it might be.\n\n120\n00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.690\nYou can go ahead and\nactually set that up to do that.\n\n121\n00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.290\nSo, when you go ahead and you create your\nrisk register, you essentially multiply\n\n122\n00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:51.370\nyour probability times your impact,\nand you come up with a risk score.\n\n123\n00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.720\nNow the way that that works is now that\nyou've come up with a risk score, you can\n\n124\n00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:02.040\nthen create some type of risk analysis\nhere based on a simple scale like this.\n\n125\n00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.190\nI have probability going\non a vertical line.\n\n126\n00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.967\nI have my impact going on that\nhorizontal line, and then,\n\n127\n00:07:08.967 --> 00:07:13.650\nyou can have just a very\ngeneral scale instead.\n\n128\n00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.560\nSo, what you're actually trying\nto do is determine this here.\n\n129\n00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.560\nLet me see if I can get that\na little bit more centered there.\n\n130\n00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.960\nWhere I actually know about\nusing this grid, then,\n\n131\n00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.250\nthat anything in this lower left-hand\narea, low probability, and low impact,\n\n132\n00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.760\nit's probably not a risk I really need\nto worry about and address, okay?\n\n133\n00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.090\nHigh probability and low impact, as long\nas I realize what that impact is and\n\n134\n00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.950\nit doesn't affect my schedule,\nmaybe again still saying that's not\n\n135\n00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.910\nreally needs to be address even\nthough it might happen more often.\n\n136\n00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:49.316\nLow probability but high impact, the high\nimpact is what concerned me is that it\n\n137\n00:07:49.316 --> 00:07:52.754\nreally affects my schedule or\nmy cost or the overall quality.\n\n138\n00:07:52.754 --> 00:07:56.075\nThen this is something that I might\naddress, but definitely something I\n\n139\n00:07:56.075 --> 00:07:59.462\nwant to address is what we call high\nprobability and high impact instead.\n\n140\n00:07:59.462 --> 00:08:03.421\nSo when you start seeing something like\nthis, you can go ahead and do that.\n\n141\n00:08:03.421 --> 00:08:08.460\nNow, based on the scale that I actually\nhave, and let me zoom back out here.\n\n142\n00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.420\nI've actually kind of done this for\n\n143\n00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.768\nboth the idea of opportunities\nas well as threats or risks too.\n\n144\n00:08:15.768 --> 00:08:17.753\nSo in the previous episode,\n\n145\n00:08:17.753 --> 00:08:22.811\nI only really had the idea of the threats\nhere, probability and impact.\n\n146\n00:08:22.811 --> 00:08:25.393\nAnd when we took a look,\nwhat we were looking for\n\n147\n00:08:25.393 --> 00:08:29.526\nwas up here in that upper right hand\nquadrant where if anything actually fell\n\n148\n00:08:29.526 --> 00:08:31.940\nin this particular area instead.\n\n149\n00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.830\nSo let's go ahead and do an example\nof what we're talking about for\n\n150\n00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.560\nthat risk score and risk metric.\n\n151\n00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.812\nSo if you were doing a qualitative\nanalysis, this is what you would do here.\n\n152\n00:08:42.812 --> 00:08:47.752\nYou would essentially take this score that\nI have right here on Risk A of 0.15 and\n\n153\n00:08:47.752 --> 00:08:51.018\nI can actually use these figures,\n0.5 and 0.3.\n\n154\n00:08:51.018 --> 00:08:56.910\nAnd I come back to my probability here and\nI realize that that's a risk.\n\n155\n00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.312\nAnd so, let me see if I can\nactually do this one right here.\n\n156\n00:09:00.312 --> 00:09:03.557\nWe'll make a little mark here and\nthat will actually work for us,\n\n157\n00:09:03.557 --> 00:09:05.510\ngonna make it dark so that we can see it.\n\n158\n00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:14.980\nSo if I go from the idea of the,\nlet me see here.\n\n159\n00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.810\nOops, wrong one, there we go.\n\n160\n00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:23.573\nThat's the one I was looking for, is\nthe 0.15 but it's probability is 0.5 and\n\n161\n00:09:23.573 --> 00:09:24.909\nthen impact is 0.3.\n\n162\n00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.731\nSo if probability is 0.5,\nwhich is about halfway up here, and\n\n163\n00:09:30.731 --> 00:09:36.394\nthen the impact of it is 0.3, I can\ntake this and essentially mark it here.\n\n164\n00:09:36.394 --> 00:09:41.184\nAnd if I do something like that, I may\nfind out at that particular point, right,\n\n165\n00:09:41.184 --> 00:09:45.716\na higher probability, but very low impact,\nis what I would be able to do.\n\n166\n00:09:45.716 --> 00:09:47.134\nNow I'm gonna copy that, and\n\n167\n00:09:47.134 --> 00:09:50.893\nwe're gonna do just another one to help\nremind us of what we can do here, okay.\n\n168\n00:09:50.893 --> 00:09:53.392\nThe other one is 0.16 and this one,\n\n169\n00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:57.960\nnotice the probability is actually\na lot lower than the actual impact.\n\n170\n00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.990\nSo here instead,\nI would actually go up to probability\n\n171\n00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:09.430\nas being a lot lower than 0.16, but\nthe impact is, well, pretty high.\n\n172\n00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.478\nSo that might be, let's say, right there.\n\n173\n00:10:13.478 --> 00:10:18.331\nAnd so this allows me to be able to\ngraphically be able to qualify whether or\n\n174\n00:10:18.331 --> 00:10:22.715\nnot that this is something I might\nactually want to take a look at and\n\n175\n00:10:22.715 --> 00:10:24.180\nbe able to do.\n\n176\n00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.330\nSo by also putting it in\na color coding we can do that.\n\n177\n00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.090\nNow the same thing also runs true with\nthe idea of opportunities, right.\n\n178\n00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.040\nWhat we're really trying to do is look,\nessentially,\n\n179\n00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.950\nin these areas where I see a bunch of red,\nand this kinda orange area as well.\n\n180\n00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.810\nThese are the ones that we had to take\ncare of by having some type of risk or\n\n181\n00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.000\nopportunity strategy that\nsays that if I go ahead and\n\n182\n00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.790\nI qualify it in this way and\ndoing a quantitative type of analysis,\n\n183\n00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.440\nit says that I actually should\nhave a plan for those things.\n\n184\n00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.350\nAnything out here in the yellowish and\n\n185\n00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.930\nin the green is probably not something\nI would actually end up planning for.\n\n186\n00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:01.530\nSo whether I actually had something like\nthis which I had the opportunity analysis\n\n187\n00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.040\nto do the same thing.\n\n188\n00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.769\nYou would again just go ahead and\nmark both of them in this situation.\n\n189\n00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:09.366\nAnd that way you know that if\nan opportunity comes along and\n\n190\n00:11:09.366 --> 00:11:12.864\nyou wanna just go ahead and qualitatively\nfigure out where that's gonna be and\n\n191\n00:11:12.864 --> 00:11:16.101\nwhether or not you need a plan for\nit, that's what you would end up dong.\n\n192\n00:11:16.101 --> 00:11:21.550\nAnd you would follow that along in terms\nof your risk management plan as well.\n\n193\n00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:25.400\nSo that's that idea of qualitative\nanalysis, when we take a look,\n\n194\n00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.880\nyou're essentially ranking it,\nis what you're doing.\n\n195\n00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:32.180\nSo you can do that, remember,\nby per project work package or\n\n196\n00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.778\nyou can do it, again, at a much\nlarger scale and level as well, okay.\n\n197\n00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.820\nNow, the other one that we have\nhere is what is called quantitative\n\n198\n00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.850\nrisk analysis instead.\n\n199\n00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:47.090\nThe quantitative risk analysis takes\na look at the overall total picture\n\n200\n00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.160\nof the risk itself, okay.\n\n201\n00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:54.000\nAnd in this one, you don't generally see\nit done on a per work package basis.\n\n202\n00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.250\nWhen you talk about quantitative,\nright, what you're trying to do when\n\n203\n00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:02.230\nit breaks down to all reality, is how\nmuch of this can you actually handle.\n\n204\n00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.650\nHow often can something like this happen?\n\n205\n00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.590\nSo you're actually trying to go ahead and\nyou're determining that\n\n206\n00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:12.440\non either per day basis or\nper month basis or per year basis.\n\n207\n00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.820\nHow often is something\nlike this gonna happen?\n\n208\n00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:19.640\nAnd that way you're actually getting a\ntotal of some sort, you're actually taking\n\n209\n00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:24.170\na look at how the quantity of\nsomething like this will happen.\n\n210\n00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.830\nNow when you do something like that,\nright, what are you doing?\n\n211\n00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.619\nYou go ahead and you take it on a week by\nweek basis that you might actually go,\n\n212\n00:12:30.619 --> 00:12:33.477\nI know that we're gonna produce\nfive bad defects a week.\n\n213\n00:12:33.477 --> 00:12:38.306\nAnd then you add it all up and say,\nquantitatively, during the entire year,\n\n214\n00:12:38.306 --> 00:12:42.186\nwe ended up with whatever it is,\n2,500 defects, okay.\n\n215\n00:12:42.186 --> 00:12:45.990\nSo that would actually be some type of\nquantitative analysis is what you would do\n\n216\n00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.310\nat that point.\n\n217\n00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:51.110\nNow, the problem that you have is, how\nthe heck do you determine stuff like that?\n\n218\n00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.990\nWell, in the qualitative analysis you\nnotice I didn't actually need any\n\n219\n00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.000\nspecial tools at all, okay.\n\n220\n00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.530\nSo being able to actually use a graph\nlike that, I actually made that one in\n\n221\n00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:04.330\nthe simple diagrams program, and actually\ndrew out that scale that we also did.\n\n222\n00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:10.260\nBut normally, when you do\nthe quantitative analysis though,\n\n223\n00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.440\nyou normally depend on some type of\ncomputer aided skill instead, okay.\n\n224\n00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.552\nYou feed the data into the model and\nyou tell it to trend it out, and\n\n225\n00:13:17.552 --> 00:13:18.977\nit will figure it out for you.\n\n226\n00:13:18.977 --> 00:13:20.980\n>> Ronnie, this sounds a lot like math.\n\n227\n00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.604\n[LAUGH]\n>> It really does, but\n\n228\n00:13:22.604 --> 00:13:26.620\nthe good thing is it's normally somebody\nelse, some program that's really doing it.\n\n229\n00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.857\nSo as long as you can show a trending of\nthe data, as long as you can do that,\n\n230\n00:13:29.857 --> 00:13:32.681\nsomewhere along the line they can\nproject that all out for you and\n\n231\n00:13:32.681 --> 00:13:34.269\nactually figure out those scores.\n\n232\n00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:37.967\nAnd so this where you hear about\nthings like the Monte Carlo method and\n\n233\n00:13:37.967 --> 00:13:42.434\nyou hear about computer aided programming\nto really help assist you in determining\n\n234\n00:13:42.434 --> 00:13:43.840\nthat quantity.\n\n235\n00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.311\nAnd you do need to do that sometimes.\n\n236\n00:13:45.311 --> 00:13:49.325\nIf your project is really on\na grand scope and scale, right,\n\n237\n00:13:49.325 --> 00:13:53.576\nwhere you know that all of the possible\nvariables for the risk and\n\n238\n00:13:53.576 --> 00:13:58.880\nstuff is beyond one person or\neven ten people being able to measure out.\n\n239\n00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.890\nThen you start actually using computers\nto help you out and generate that.\n\n240\n00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:06.710\nCuz you can imagine by hand,\neven with the qualitative analysis,\n\n241\n00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:10.240\nit's just really beyond most people.\n\n242\n00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.520\nSo those are kinda the two\nmodels that we use to try and\n\n243\n00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.080\nhelp us determine the potential impact\n\n244\n00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.560\nthat it could actually affect\nthe overall project itself, okay.\n\n245\n00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.660\nSo that's where risk management really\ndoes come in on those two scopes.\n\n246\n00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.750\nAnd those are kinda\nthe basic primary tools\n\n247\n00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.660\nthat we will end up using\nright at the beginning.\n\n248\n00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.770\nOnce you actually get into this and\nyou get used to it, whatever system that\n\n249\n00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.990\nyour particular company uses,\nyou're gonna follow whatever they use.\n\n250\n00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.540\nAnd most of the time,\nit's gonna be computer aided models, why?\n\n251\n00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.932\nMuch more accurate than Ronnie\ncreating a scale by hand and\n\n252\n00:14:42.932 --> 00:14:46.420\ngoing let's just draw these dots here and\nmake a graph of some sort.\n\n253\n00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.270\nAs neat as it looks, okay,\nit is time consuming.\n\n254\n00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:55.050\n>> So the quantitative model is what we're\nnormally going to run into as the method?\n\n255\n00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:59.115\n>> Well, it's the method if you're\nactually trying to determine the number,\n\n256\n00:14:59.115 --> 00:15:03.360\nright, of risks that you're gonna end\nup affecting on one particular type.\n\n257\n00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:07.640\nSo if you realize that there's\na risk of typhoons happening or\n\n258\n00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.670\nhurricanes happening, right, that's a\nqualitative analysis that we're trying to\n\n259\n00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.080\ndo for our overall project, okay.\n\n260\n00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.700\nBut we don't do it at\nthe work package level.\n\n261\n00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.780\nBut a lot of times we actually end up\ndoing the qualitative analysis more,\n\n262\n00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.590\nbecause we can actually predict things\nby actually giving them a rating.\n\n263\n00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.390\nBy bringing onto our\nproject team members and\n\n264\n00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.140\nsaying all right,\nwhat's the probability of this happening?\n\n265\n00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:33.570\nOkay, and if you said it occurred, give\nme an impact on a scale of one to five.\n\n266\n00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.998\nWell, most of the time we can bring\nin a team of five or ten people and\n\n267\n00:15:36.998 --> 00:15:38.602\nthey can just write that down.\n\n268\n00:15:38.602 --> 00:15:42.260\nAnd then we take all that, we average\nit out, or we add them all together or\n\n269\n00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.561\nwe do whatever we want to.\n\n270\n00:15:43.561 --> 00:15:46.728\nAnd we can put that into a computer\naided design that will help us, or\n\n271\n00:15:46.728 --> 00:15:48.240\nwe can actually manually do it.\n\n272\n00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.462\nAnd that way, we'll actually see where\nthey end up charting out for everybody.\n\n273\n00:15:51.462 --> 00:15:54.591\nAnd we'll see groupings and\nhow they work in that way,\n\n274\n00:15:54.591 --> 00:15:59.353\nof actually development the scale or the\ncurve that we need for the qualitative, so\n\n275\n00:15:59.353 --> 00:16:03.569\nWhen you're actually having to do it\nby project package or work package,\n\n276\n00:16:03.569 --> 00:16:08.490\nexcuse me, or even at larger scales,\nyou're normally talking about qualitative.\n\n277\n00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.620\nIf you're actually trying to determine for\nthe entire project and\n\n278\n00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.190\nhow often something's gonna happen, and\n\n279\n00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:18.970\nas far as a risk or an opportunity goes,\nthen you're actually doing quantitative.\n\n280\n00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:23.647\nSo normally you actually see qualitative\nmore often than you see quantitative,\n\n281\n00:16:23.647 --> 00:16:28.531\nunless you actually believe that for one\nreason or another, you're gonna face more\n\n282\n00:16:28.531 --> 00:16:33.482\nrisk than ever, and you actually see the\nidea of quantitative happening more often,\n\n283\n00:16:33.482 --> 00:16:35.163\nwhich you normally won't.\n\n284\n00:16:35.163 --> 00:16:39.518\nUsually the reason why you do that is\nbecause you are expecting risks to happen\n\n285\n00:16:39.518 --> 00:16:43.020\nand then you just are trying\nto determine how often.\n\n286\n00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.060\nMost of the time we don't,\nif we're on small projects,\n\n287\n00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.160\nwe don't see anything risky\nwith a lot of small projects.\n\n288\n00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.583\nI'm not saying it can't happen but\nnormally we order the stuff that we need,\n\n289\n00:16:52.583 --> 00:16:55.020\nwe've got our project team ready to go,\nwe're fine.\n\n290\n00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.569\nIf I'm now working though on\na bridge project, let's say,\n\n291\n00:16:58.569 --> 00:17:00.378\nover in the Asian Pacific Rim,\n\n292\n00:17:00.378 --> 00:17:05.123\nwell then I have to worry about typhoons,\nand fog, and tidal waves, and [LAUGH].\n\n293\n00:17:05.123 --> 00:17:08.279\nYou have to actually pay a little bit\nmore attention to and try and be more\n\n294\n00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:11.820\nquantitative about it cuz that will\ninterrupt your flow and your schedule.\n\n295\n00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.110\n>> Yeah, these things happen.\n\n296\n00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:17.420\nAnd, that really brings up our great next\npoint which is, now that we've identified\n\n297\n00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.900\nwhat the risks might be and we've used\neither a quantitative or a qualitative\n\n298\n00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:26.050\nanalysis to figure that out, now what do\nwe do when something actually occurs?\n\n299\n00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:30.130\nOne of these risks have come to light,\nit is a reality we've got to deal with it.\n\n300\n00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:31.390\nHow do we deal with it Ronnie?\n\n301\n00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:32.970\n>> When we start taking a look at that,\nright?\n\n302\n00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.070\nYou have to actually determine,\n\n303\n00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:38.950\nfirst of all whether that's what we call\na threat or the idea of an opportunity.\n\n304\n00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.540\nSo I went ahead and tried to\nbalance these things out for us, so\n\n305\n00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.010\nthat we can see what we're talking about.\n\n306\n00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:47.710\nNow normally when we start taking about\nthe threat, we normally use the term risk,\n\n307\n00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.510\nwhen we take a look at the idea\nof opportunities, we normally use\n\n308\n00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:55.400\nthe term opportunities, or we use positive\nrisk is what we're talking about as well.\n\n309\n00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.970\nSo that's the first thing\nyou have to determine.\n\n310\n00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:00.050\nNow if you're going like,\nhow the heck do we determine that?\n\n311\n00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:03.470\nWell you can come back here and\ndo the same thing, right?\n\n312\n00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.991\nSo along this line right in the middle,\nright here in the number 1, right,\n\n313\n00:18:07.991 --> 00:18:11.860\nif everything is a 1 and a 1 and\nit slaps you right there in the center,\n\n314\n00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.550\nwell that's the only one that you really\nhave to worry about is right here, okay?\n\n315\n00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.160\nSo, right there,\nthat's actually kind of the midline.\n\n316\n00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.840\nYou can't tell whether it's a risk or\n\n317\n00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.030\nwhether it's a threat against your\nproject, and so what do you do?\n\n318\n00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.730\nYou plan for everything that\nyou possibly can plan for, but\n\n319\n00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:32.720\nthe very fact is the majority of these\nwill never follow exactly a 1 and a 1.\n\n320\n00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.260\nWhether it's an opportunity or a threat\nhere, because what we're saying at that\n\n321\n00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:41.020\npoint, high probability, high impact,\nwe're essentially guaranteeing that it's\n\n322\n00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:45.400\ngonna work, and whatever it is,\nit's gonna impact our particular project.\n\n323\n00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.770\nAnd if we have something\nthat certain about it,\n\n324\n00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:49.280\nwe should absolutely plan for it.\n\n325\n00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.580\nIf it's absolutely that certain,\n\n326\n00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.130\nyou definitely need to\nmake sure that you do so.\n\n327\n00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.822\nSo, being able to use\nsomething like this then,\n\n328\n00:18:56.822 --> 00:19:01.690\nwill help you to be able to at least\ndetermine whether it's a threat or\n\n329\n00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:06.260\nan opportunity, and then from that point\nyou need to actually come up with some way\n\n330\n00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:12.540\nof responding to the actual\nrisk that we have.\n\n331\n00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.380\nNow when it comes down to it, there's\nseveral ways that we can respond to it.\n\n332\n00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.350\nWe're gonna take a look at\nour risk management plan and\n\n333\n00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:19.690\nwe'll talk about the idea\nof responding to risk, and\n\n334\n00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.220\nthere's actually five different ways,\nbut they've kind of broken it down in\n\n335\n00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:27.790\nthe CompTIA here on the exam objectives,\nI'll really only call out a few of them.\n\n336\n00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:30.710\nIf you're dealing with\nan opportunity at this point,\n\n337\n00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:34.470\nyour risk response here is\nactually one of three actions.\n\n338\n00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.290\nAre you going to share this opportunity,\nin other words,\n\n339\n00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:41.020\nwho are you willing to actually\nbless with this other opportunity,\n\n340\n00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.580\nthat you want to bring them in on this?\n\n341\n00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.689\nSo, are you willing to spread\nthe joy on an opportunity like this?\n\n342\n00:19:47.689 --> 00:19:51.462\nOr is it an opportunity that you\ncan simply exploit, in other words,\n\n343\n00:19:51.462 --> 00:19:53.023\nuse it to your advantage, or\n\n344\n00:19:53.023 --> 00:19:57.770\nis it something that actually helps\nenhance what it is that you're doing?\n\n345\n00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:59.930\nSo you've got to be able then,\nat that point,\n\n346\n00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:03.810\nto actually say, here's what I'd like\nto do with this bigger opportunity,\n\n347\n00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:08.500\nI'd like to use it as an enhancement,\nor I'd like to share the opportunity, or\n\n348\n00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:13.230\nI think I need to take advantage of what's\nactually been presented to me in this way.\n\n349\n00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.880\nAnd you come up with those particular\nresponses that you need that\n\n350\n00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:18.530\nwill allow you to gain\nthe advantage of that.\n\n351\n00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:20.540\nAnd that way you can actually go ahead and\nplan it out and\n\n352\n00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.120\nsay which one of these\nthree you're gonna do.\n\n353\n00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:27.020\nThe same thing then with the idea of\na threat to our project schedule,\n\n354\n00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:31.230\ncost, or scope as well is that we\ncan avoid it, we can accept it, or\n\n355\n00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.870\nwe can try and mitigate it as well.\n\n356\n00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:36.110\nThere are a lot of things\nwe just want to avoid.\n\n357\n00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.884\nWhy, because mitigating takes time.\n\n358\n00:20:38.884 --> 00:20:43.563\nAnd even though mitigating is actually\nthe permanent solution to most threats,\n\n359\n00:20:43.563 --> 00:20:48.100\nwell can you afford to take the time\nto actually mitigate it right then?\n\n360\n00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.360\nEspecially if it demands that\nyou stop your project progress,\n\n361\n00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.030\nyou may not be able to.\n\n362\n00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:57.300\nAvoidance though, you might actually\nbe able to hold it back for a while and\n\n363\n00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.760\ncontinue on your progress until there\nis a point that you can stop and go,\n\n364\n00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:02.740\nhey let me deal with it now.\n\n365\n00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.230\nSometimes though,\nyou don't have that opportunity, so\n\n366\n00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:09.350\nyou're either gonna accept that, and\nyou're gonna pay for it in some way or\n\n367\n00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:12.870\nyou are gonna take the time\nto mitigate it as well, okay?\n\n368\n00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:17.470\nSo those are really our responses\nthat we can have to our\n\n369\n00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:21.020\nproject actually being at risk as well,\nokay?\n\n370\n00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.260\nSo there are a couple of other ones,\n\n371\n00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.140\nremember you make sure you check\nout the previous episodes.\n\n372\n00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.430\nWe don't wanna go through\nthe entire process again, but\n\n373\n00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.620\nthere are at least two others that you\ncan actually deal with at that point.\n\n374\n00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.940\nBut just kind of realize that\nresponding to the risk overall, okay,\n\n375\n00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.260\nis what we wanna have, so\nif we can identify the risk,\n\n376\n00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:41.970\nif we can take time to analyze them and\ntheir impact to our overall project,\n\n377\n00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:47.350\nif we have a response strategy in hand,\nthat actually is how you begin to manage\n\n378\n00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:50.100\nthe risk that you end up\nfacing on your project.\n\n379\n00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.250\n>> Very nice, now it's obviously\nit's a very important thing,\n\n380\n00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:57.411\nrisk is going to happen, risk is out there\nit's a part of every single project, but\n\n381\n00:21:57.411 --> 00:22:00.680\nusually so are opportunities as well,\nso you gotta take a look and\n\n382\n00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.476\nbe on the look out for those things.\n\n383\n00:22:02.476 --> 00:22:06.072\nUse the different quantitative and\nqualitative analysis that we can\n\n384\n00:22:06.072 --> 00:22:10.650\nuse to try to figure out what are those\nrisks and what are those opportunities?\n\n385\n00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:12.810\nAnd Ronnie you gave us\nsome great tools and\n\n386\n00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:15.272\nsome great insight on\nhow to do that today.\n\n387\n00:22:15.272 --> 00:22:16.980\nAnything else that you wanna\ncover in this episode?\n\n388\n00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.770\n>> There's just a couple of other\nthings that I wanna make sure that\n\n389\n00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:22.010\nwe also point out too that\nwill really help you out.\n\n390\n00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.320\nNow even though these\nare the key points by far,\n\n391\n00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.350\nright, you being a project manager though,\nyou need to actually realize\n\n392\n00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:32.410\nthat there’re sometimes where your\nproject actually registers something.\n\n393\n00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:35.760\nYou’re actually now in the groove\nof managing everything and\n\n394\n00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:38.920\nnow that you've actually got a good\nrisk response strategy in hand,\n\n395\n00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.545\nyou may find out that you start\nseeing symptoms of risk occurring.\n\n396\n00:22:42.545 --> 00:22:46.280\nIt's what we call the idea\nof risk triggers, right?\n\n397\n00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.980\nThat you might actually realize\nthat something has actually\n\n398\n00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:49.960\nhappened previously,\n\n399\n00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:55.170\nlet's say on a completed work package,\nthat ended up becoming a risk for you.\n\n400\n00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.980\nAnd now as you start progressing\nthrough your project,\n\n401\n00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:01.230\nyou may start to see the same\nthing happening again.\n\n402\n00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:03.580\nSo when you start looking at\nthat you're actually looking for\n\n403\n00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.470\nessentially signs, right?\n\n404\n00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:09.530\nLittle things that indicate that this\nlooks like it's gonna happen again.\n\n405\n00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:14.420\nSo this can be as subjective\nas you want it to be.\n\n406\n00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.460\nIt could be objective as well especially\nif you're right there on top of\n\n407\n00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.240\nthe risk too.\n\n408\n00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.720\nSo, you gotta, actually, just make sure\nthat you're paying attention there,\n\n409\n00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:26.780\nin terms of different triggers that\nmay also happen as well, okay?\n\n410\n00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.080\nThe other thing that you've got to\nremember is that, even though you might\n\n411\n00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:35.850\ndeal with one risk,\nyou may find that that risk reoccurs,\n\n412\n00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:40.460\nor has what we call secondary risks\nthat actually occur from it, so\n\n413\n00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.830\nin other words,\nit's the idea of putting out fires.\n\n414\n00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:44.630\nYou think you've dealt with the issue?\n\n415\n00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:47.687\nBut if you didn't, if you actually\ndid not deal with the issue,\n\n416\n00:23:47.687 --> 00:23:49.839\nif you did not actually\nconfront the issue and\n\n417\n00:23:49.839 --> 00:23:53.066\nyou used one of those different\nstrategies to deal with it instead,\n\n418\n00:23:53.066 --> 00:23:57.088\nwhether it's avoidance or whether it's\nacceptance or something, you may find out\n\n419\n00:23:57.088 --> 00:24:00.629\nthat doing something like that actually\ncaused another issue to come up.\n\n420\n00:24:00.629 --> 00:24:03.850\nSo you need to be a little bit more\ncomprehensive in what you're looking\n\n421\n00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:05.299\naround doing, because if not,\n\n422\n00:24:05.299 --> 00:24:09.380\nyou're gonna end up seeing that\nsecondary risk end up happening as well.\n\n423\n00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.050\nYou may also find out that\nthe result of dealing and\n\n424\n00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:17.520\nmitigating that risk was satisfactory for\nyou as a project manager, but\n\n425\n00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.670\nmay have actually turned a sour stomach\nfor somebody else on your project, okay.\n\n426\n00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:26.490\nWhich now means you have to deal with some\nhuman resources types of issues you may\n\n427\n00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:30.170\nhave to do with some team building,\nwhere you have to slow down things.\n\n428\n00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.930\nSo you can never realize what the overall\n\n429\n00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:36.310\nresult is until you\ntake a moment to do so.\n\n430\n00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.598\nJust saying okay,\nit's done, it's complete,\n\n431\n00:24:38.598 --> 00:24:40.071\nwe can move on with our work now.\n\n432\n00:24:40.071 --> 00:24:44.692\nYes, in reality that's all it should take,\nbut remember because you're dealing with\n\n433\n00:24:44.692 --> 00:24:49.126\npeople who have feelings and personalities\nand stuff, it means you also have to deal\n\n434\n00:24:49.126 --> 00:24:53.446\nwith the risk that hey, your answer may\nnot have ever been satisfactory for them.\n\n435\n00:24:53.446 --> 00:24:56.029\nAnd that can cause a big\nslowdown on your project as well.\n\n436\n00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.766\n>> Ronnie, what are these feeling\nof which you were talking about?\n\n437\n00:24:56.766 --> 00:24:59.447\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n438\n00:24:59.447 --> 00:25:03.394\n>> You're right though, and it's the human\nfactor, is a really big deal when it comes\n\n439\n00:25:03.394 --> 00:25:06.451\nto risk, because when you put\npeople at risk for certain things,\n\n440\n00:25:06.451 --> 00:25:10.080\nthey tend to get emotional about it,\nespecially if those risks come to pass.\n\n441\n00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.500\nSo you gotta be on the ball,\n\n442\n00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.600\nyou gotta be prepared for\nsomething that might happen that way.\n\n443\n00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.600\nAnd I might have to take Ronnie of to\nthe side and say, how are you doing?\n\n444\n00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.540\nGive him a pat on the back, is there\nanything we can do to make you feel better\n\n445\n00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:24.420\nabout going through that\nthing that was risky for us?\n\n446\n00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:27.112\n>> And there's a couple of\nother things too, right.\n\n447\n00:25:27.112 --> 00:25:30.049\nThe very fact is that once\nyou actually go through and\n\n448\n00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:34.521\nyou start to have to handle the risk and\ndeal with them using the strategies, you\n\n449\n00:25:34.521 --> 00:25:39.480\nmay now have to come back and reexamine\nwhat your original assumption was.\n\n450\n00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.160\nYour original assumption may have been\nthat hey, this is what caused that risk.\n\n451\n00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.290\nOr this is why we ran into this,\nbut if it's coming about again and\n\n452\n00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:48.000\nyou said, we just solved that problem.\n\n453\n00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.570\nWhy is it coming back again?\n\n454\n00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:50.600\nYou may have to go back and\n\n455\n00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:56.050\ndeal again with your particular assumption\nabout what actually happened at risk.\n\n456\n00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:57.540\nBut then on the management side.\n\n457\n00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:01.250\nSo this is all stuff that you just\nhave to go, I need to examine.\n\n458\n00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.190\nI need to realize what's going on.\n\n459\n00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:06.090\nBut even on the management side,\nyou need to make sure that\n\n460\n00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:09.310\nyou're still documenting, you're\nstill keeping up on all these forms,\n\n461\n00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:12.150\nyou're still doing all the stuff\nthat needs to be done.\n\n462\n00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.936\nSo that way you have it actually listed\nthere, and that you can go back and\n\n463\n00:26:14.936 --> 00:26:16.320\nreview it when possible.\n\n464\n00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.010\nSo you want to make sure that you\nare actually setting everything up so\n\n465\n00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:22.920\nthat you can back and\nactually deal with all of those too.\n\n466\n00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.390\nBecause if not, you will actually\nforget a risk that happened and\n\n467\n00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:28.480\nyou'll be surprised it came up again.\n\n468\n00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.920\nYou won't actually have anybody that will\nbe able to tell you when it happened,\n\n469\n00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.010\nwhat happened, so it's also up to you.\n\n470\n00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:38.001\nSo that way you have that risk register,\nyou have everything else in hand as far as\n\n471\n00:26:38.001 --> 00:26:41.237\ndocumentation, and this way you\nmanage all those risks better.\n\n472\n00:26:41.237 --> 00:26:44.350\n>> That's right, and\ndon't forget if a risk does occur,\n\n473\n00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:46.480\nnow it's always a bad thing, right?\n\n474\n00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.710\nYou've taken the risk,\nthe worst doesn't happen,\n\n475\n00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:52.760\nthe bottom fell out of the world and\nthen the sky is falling.\n\n476\n00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.690\nWhat are you gonna do?\n\n477\n00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:55.321\nWell, you have contingencies in place.\n\n478\n00:26:55.321 --> 00:26:57.321\nYou should anyway, hopefully you do.\n\n479\n00:26:57.321 --> 00:27:01.748\nAnd you probably have a risk plan,\nlike what do we do when that risk happens,\n\n480\n00:27:01.748 --> 00:27:03.540\nif that risk happens?\n\n481\n00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.880\nNow you get to evaluate those, right?\n\n482\n00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:08.120\nYou get to see there's a bit of a silver\nlining to just about every one of\n\n483\n00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.140\nthese storm clouds.\n\n484\n00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.362\nYou can see did those things work, right?\n\n485\n00:27:11.362 --> 00:27:14.946\nWere we effective and\ndo we need to reevaluate these things?\n\n486\n00:27:14.946 --> 00:27:16.870\n>> That's definitely a big part of it,\nright?\n\n487\n00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:20.590\nCuz every risk is actually\nbring that aspect to you.\n\n488\n00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:22.958\nAnd you do need to take the time to do so.\n\n489\n00:27:22.958 --> 00:27:24.490\nJust saying, okay, we've dealt with it and\n\n490\n00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:28.230\nwe need to move on, that's probably the\neasiest way to get you back on schedule,\n\n491\n00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:31.770\nbut it's also the easiest way to\nre-introduce more risk into your project.\n\n492\n00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:34.730\nSo take the time to see if how\nyou dealt with it was effective,\n\n493\n00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:37.300\ntake the time to actually update\nall the things that you need to,\n\n494\n00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.750\nand that will give you more and\nmore information, more and\n\n495\n00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:45.080\nmore ammo if you want to, to deal with\nit again at a later date if you have to.\n\n496\n00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.010\n>> Well Ronnie, I know it was risky\nstepping into the studio today to talk\n\n497\n00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:49.010\nabout risk management.\n\n498\n00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:52.470\nBut we do appreciate it and your insights\nand all that you've given us, so\n\n499\n00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.400\nthat we are better prepared for\n\n500\n00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.570\nour projects Project+, and\nour projects that we're working on.\n\n501\n00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:57.960\nThanks again for stopping by Ronnie.\n\n502\n00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.612\nWe're gonna go ahead and close the show.\n\n503\n00:27:59.612 --> 00:28:01.960\nHopefully you guys enjoyed it and\ngot a lot out of it.\n\n504\n00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.640\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n505\n00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.330\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n506\n00:28:05.330 -->

00:00:16.615\nI'm your host Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:20.935\nin today's episode we're gonna be\nmoving through our Project+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:20.935 --> 00:00:22.185\nAnd we've got none other than Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:24.237\nRonnie Wong here to help\nus out with that content.\n\n7\n00:00:24.237 --> 00:00:25.955\nRonnie, how you doing, and welcome sir.\n\n8\n00:00:25.955 --> 00:00:28.825\n>> Well thank you for having me\nback on the show as we continue on,\n\n9\n00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:31.880\ntaking a look at more CompTIA Project+.\n\n10\n00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.010\nIn this particular episode,\n\n11\n00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.390\nwe're gonna focus in on what\nwe call resource leveling.\n\n12\n00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.820\nRemember that there's a lot of times when\nyour project plan is actually out there,\n\n13\n00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.700\nand you're in the use of it, but now,\nas your project begins to progress, or\n\n14\n00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.460\ncontinues to progress,\n\n15\n00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.870\nwhat ends up happening is that\nyou start running into situations\n\n16\n00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.300\nthat you just really had no way to account\nfor during the planning stage itself.\n\n17\n00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.370\nAnd that means that there's gonna be\nadjustments that need to be made to your\n\n18\n00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.800\nproject plan as you continue\nto actually monitor and\n\n19\n00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.650\ncontrol that progress that goes\nthroughout your entire project.\n\n20\n00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.400\nNow the reason why this is important\nis that even though we believe\n\n21\n00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.000\nwe've set up the perfect project using\nour project plan, the reality is, things\n\n22\n00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.170\nhappen that we can't account for, and\neven small things we can't account for.\n\n23\n00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.170\nAnd then, start shifting things around and\nall of a sudden here it is, we're\n\n24\n00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.220\na little bit farther behind\nour schedule than we think or\n\n25\n00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.100\ncosts have actually become a little bit\nhigher than we believed that they would.\n\n26\n00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.460\nChanges that have been introduced into our\nproject itself through the actual official\n\n27\n00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.355\nchange process,\n\n28\n00:01:36.355 --> 00:01:40.130\nthey've added in more than we can\nactually handle at any one point in time.\n\n29\n00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.806\nAnd so what we actually have to do then\nis we need to go back in and take a look\n\n30\n00:01:44.806 --> 00:01:49.176\nat what we can do to essentially\noptimize our schedule a little bit,\n\n31\n00:01:49.176 --> 00:01:51.038\nor our project plan as well.\n\n32\n00:01:51.038 --> 00:01:54.420\nNow when we start talking about\nthe idea of optimization,\n\n33\n00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.770\nthe key elements here are fairly simple.\n\n34\n00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.940\nRemember that because every project\nis actually constrained by those\n\n35\n00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.110\nthree project constraints of time,\nof cost and of course requirements,\n\n36\n00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.490\nthat we actually want to make changes in\nthose ways that will really help us out.\n\n37\n00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.794\nA lot of times the cost itself is actually\nconstrained, not because of something that\n\n38\n00:02:15.794 --> 00:02:19.737\nI chose to do, which is to cut corners,\nbut it's because I've actually spent\n\n39\n00:02:19.737 --> 00:02:23.538\nthe money a little bit, maybe probably\ntoo far or too early in my schedule.\n\n40\n00:02:23.538 --> 00:02:27.459\nAnd that now means a strain on\nthe idea of the constraints,\n\n41\n00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.520\nin terms of scope and\nof course in terms of time for us.\n\n42\n00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.456\nOr it could be that I realize that one\nparticular aspect of our project here\n\n43\n00:02:35.456 --> 00:02:39.073\nhas taken longer than it needed to,\nand now I need to actually do some\n\n44\n00:02:39.073 --> 00:02:42.328\nother things with my particular cost,\nas well as the scope.\n\n45\n00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:45.690\nOr you can actually see again the scope\nand the changes that can go on there.\n\n46\n00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.210\nAnd that effects, of course,\ncost as well as the time element\n\n47\n00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.730\nthat I have to complete all of\nthe requirements for my project.\n\n48\n00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.770\nSo, what do we do?\n\n49\n00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.010\nWhat we have to do is we have to\nunderstand that along the way we're gonna\n\n50\n00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.240\nmassage everything to try and\nmove it back into our project's scope and\n\n51\n00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.290\ninto the time requirements, into\nthe budget elements, as much as we can.\n\n52\n00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.750\nAnd one of the most effective\nways that we can actually do\n\n53\n00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.280\nthat is by doing something that\nwe call resource leveling.\n\n54\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.320\nNow if you're use to using a program\nlike Microsoft Project, so\n\n55\n00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.280\nthat's the one I'm most familiar with so\nI'm going to use that as an example, but\n\n56\n00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.220\nthere are plenty other project management\nintegration software that's out there for\n\n57\n00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.270\nyou that you can actually use.\n\n58\n00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.639\nBut if you're used to using those types of\nprograms, the great thing about it is that\n\n59\n00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.575\nthey can take all of your information\nas you're entering it in and as you're\n\n60\n00:03:36.575 --> 00:03:40.961\nmonitoring your project and updating your\nproject plan, they can take all of that.\n\n61\n00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:43.534\nAnd then you simply click on a menu and\nyou tell it,\n\n62\n00:03:43.534 --> 00:03:47.450\nhey I wanna do some resource leveling,\nI wanna actually do this.\n\n63\n00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.910\nAnd it can actually do that for\n\n64\n00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.740\nyou without you having to go through and\ndo a lot of other things.\n\n65\n00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.590\nBut what we want to do today is we want to\nfocus in on some of the techniques that\n\n66\n00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.460\nyou can use even if you don't have one of\nthose particular types of tools out there,\n\n67\n00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.560\nthat you can actually use\nto be able to visualize and\n\n68\n00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.340\nto help you get your project back\non to the plan that it needs to be.\n\n69\n00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.812\nSo that is what we're setting up today and\nwe're gonna specifically look at three\n\n70\n00:04:13.812 --> 00:04:16.143\ndifferent tools today is\nwhat we're going to look at.\n\n71\n00:04:16.143 --> 00:04:20.661\nWe're gonna take a look at fast tracking,\nour particular resources, and\n\n72\n00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:22.765\nof course our project plan.\n\n73\n00:04:22.765 --> 00:04:26.360\nWe're gonna also look at the idea\nof crashing our project plan, and\n\n74\n00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.600\nthen lastly, we'll talk about the idea\nof delaying portions of our project\n\n75\n00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.480\nplan as well to ensure that we get\neverything in there that we need to.\n\n76\n00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.570\nThese three methods are very effective and\ncan be used very easily, but it does take\n\n77\n00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.054\ntime and coordination to implement them,\nbut your particular idea today is simple.\n\n78\n00:04:45.054 --> 00:04:48.885\nIt's to make sure that you understand\nwhen these things are actually used, and\n\n79\n00:04:48.885 --> 00:04:50.657\nthen you can actually turn around and\n\n80\n00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:54.275\nstart figuring out how in the world am\nI going to get this to actually apply?\n\n81\n00:04:54.275 --> 00:04:58.813\nSo we're going to take a look at them from\na scenario basis first, and then we'll\n\n82\n00:04:58.813 --> 00:05:03.170\nshow you what the overall effect of that\nshould be in a graphic manner as well.\n\n83\n00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.920\nSo, here's a basic scenario that\nI've actually written up to try and\n\n84\n00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.830\nhelp us out here, and try and see which of\nthose three particular plans are actions\n\n85\n00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.310\nthat we want to take in terms\nof resource leveling here.\n\n86\n00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.730\nSo let's say that we're actually doing\nsome type of IT project like this.\n\n87\n00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.350\nOur project requires for us to have four\nservers with Microsoft Hyper-V installed\n\n88\n00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.960\nfor a virtualization cluster, okay?\n\n89\n00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.810\nThe installation will essentially be\nidentical among those four servers with\n\n90\n00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.010\njust a few minor configuration differences\nto make sure that they are also unique.\n\n91\n00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.780\nYou have a single resource that's\nworking on this installation, so\n\n92\n00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.030\nlet's say it's one person working on this.\n\n93\n00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.420\nWhat technique can we use\nto help us to save time\n\n94\n00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.210\non the installation of those four servers?\n\n95\n00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.980\nWell, let's take a look at what\nwe're talking about here in\n\n96\n00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.980\njust the scenario in front of us.\n\n97\n00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.660\nWhat we're actually saying right now\nis that one person is working on this\n\n98\n00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.850\nparticular situation that we're actually\nseeing here, and we actually have four\n\n99\n00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.960\nservers that need to actually be installed\nwith Microsoft Hyper-V on it right?\n\n100\n00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.910\nSo in that particular process,\nif I know the process,\n\n101\n00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.770\nI understand that we have to actually\nget the servers up, and then we have to\n\n102\n00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:21.230\ninstall the Microsoft Hyper-V right on\neach one of those servers at that point.\n\n103\n00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.804\nIf I have one person doing\nit right then and there,\n\n104\n00:06:23.804 --> 00:06:27.544\nwhat that means is more than likely\none person's gonna take one server,\n\n105\n00:06:27.544 --> 00:06:31.683\nbegin the installation process,\nfinish that installation process on there.\n\n106\n00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:34.755\nAnd then start on server number two,\nfinish that one up,\n\n107\n00:06:34.755 --> 00:06:38.820\nand then do the same thing with\nnumber three as well as number four.\n\n108\n00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.620\nSo when we take a look at that, what we're\nactually saying is that, hey, each one of\n\n109\n00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.650\nthese servers is actually going to be done\none after the other, after the other.\n\n110\n00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.210\nAnd so let's say that we\ngive it around a hour and\n\n111\n00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.090\na half each time to get everything set up,\nand you may go, it doesn't take that long.\n\n112\n00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.542\nThat's fine, I'm just giving\nsome particular time period.\n\n113\n00:06:55.542 --> 00:06:58.734\nBut let's say it's an hour and\na half for each one of those servers to\n\n114\n00:06:58.734 --> 00:07:01.928\nget installed, to get up to date,\nto get everything that we need for\n\n115\n00:07:01.928 --> 00:07:05.050\nits initial installation\ninto what we want it to do.\n\n116\n00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.480\nWell, if you add that up, right?\n\n117\n00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.120\nAn hour and a half for each one times\nfour, that's about six hours is what we're\n\n118\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:16.250\ntalking about if we're doing it one\nafter the other after the other, okay?\n\n119\n00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.780\nSo, when we take a look at those three\nelements again that we talked about in\n\n120\n00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.410\nterms of fast tracking, in terms of\ncrashing the plan, in terms of delay,\n\n121\n00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:29.240\nthe one that I can rule out\nimmediately is the idea of delay.\n\n122\n00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.000\nIf I want to ensure, okay,\n\n123\n00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.530\nthat we need to to save time,\ndelay is the one that I don't want, right.\n\n124\n00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:36.930\nThe very fact is that hey,\n\n125\n00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.500\nat this particular point in time, a delay\nis actually gonna increase my time and\n\n126\n00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:46.980\nnot save any of my time, so I can\neliminate that as a possibility here.\n\n127\n00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.931\nBut that does leave me\nwith two other options\n\n128\n00:07:49.931 --> 00:07:52.891\nthat I can actually think about and\nchoose.\n\n129\n00:07:52.891 --> 00:07:55.849\nAnd we're gonna actually see\nsomething in a moment as well,\n\n130\n00:07:55.849 --> 00:08:00.260\nthat in this particular situation,\nboth options will actually work.\n\n131\n00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.228\nAnd actually do what we want to.\n\n132\n00:08:02.228 --> 00:08:05.453\nSo there is the idea of what\nwe call fast tracking and\n\n133\n00:08:05.453 --> 00:08:09.440\nthen there is also the idea of\ncrashing the plan as well, okay.\n\n134\n00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.086\nSo when you start to\ntake a look at this one,\n\n135\n00:08:12.086 --> 00:08:16.290\nright now I have a single resource\nworking on this particular installation.\n\n136\n00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.600\nWell, what we can actually\ndo instead here, okay?\n\n137\n00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.490\nIn the idea of fast tracking, if you don't\nunderstand that the whole concept behind\n\n138\n00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:27.500\nfast tracking, we've talked about\nthis earlier in our planning stage,\n\n139\n00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.060\nwhen we talked about the idea of making\nsure that we understood what we could do\n\n140\n00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:35.050\nto our project plan to essentially shorten\nthe overall duration of the project.\n\n141\n00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:36.030\nSo make sure you go back and\n\n142\n00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.930\ncheck those episodes out that we\nrecorded in a previous episode there.\n\n143\n00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:42.310\nAnd you actually get a little\nmore detail on this.\n\n144\n00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.732\nBut fast tracking essentially says\nlet's go ahead and start, well,\n\n145\n00:08:45.732 --> 00:08:48.574\nlet's say all four of these\nprocesses at the same time, or\n\n146\n00:08:48.574 --> 00:08:50.959\nat least two of these\nprocesses at the same time.\n\n147\n00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:55.086\nInstead of actually finishing up server\na and then starting on server b,\n\n148\n00:08:55.086 --> 00:09:00.280\nlet's go ahead and start server a and\nserver b's installation at the same time.\n\n149\n00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.700\nNow you might have a little bit\nmore requirement than that, and so\n\n150\n00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.300\nyou have to take a look, but\nlet me show you what that would look like.\n\n151\n00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.560\nAnd so in this instance here,\nI'm actually talking about the idea of\n\n152\n00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.270\nusing something like\nfast tracking instead.\n\n153\n00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.720\nSo let's take a look here in our scenario.\n\n154\n00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.360\nOkay, so\nwhat I essentially described is that\n\n155\n00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.130\nwe would start server a up here\nin the upper-left hand corner.\n\n156\n00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.230\nAnd then we would finish that entire\nduration of that task an hour\n\n157\n00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.400\nand a half later.\n\n158\n00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.460\nThen we could start on task b,\n\n159\n00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.430\nmake sure we take about that same\nrequisite time to finish the whole thing.\n\n160\n00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:37.160\nAnd then we start on c,\nand then d of course.\n\n161\n00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.070\nYou'd continue on that process.\n\n162\n00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:43.060\nNotice the overall length and\nduration of that expanse.\n\n163\n00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.440\nAll three of these tasks, as they begin,\n\n164\n00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.990\nfinish to start, in the way that I have\nit laid out in my project plan, right?\n\n165\n00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.940\nIf we implement something\nlike fast tracking instead,\n\n166\n00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:59.010\nwhat we essentially do is, if you take\na look at this bottom line down here,\n\n167\n00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:02.060\nis that we shorten the overall duration.\n\n168\n00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:06.120\nNow, as far as the time element goes,\nit's still the same, right?\n\n169\n00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.470\nThe task a took an hour and a half.\n\n170\n00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.200\nTask b took an hour and\na half, there's three hours.\n\n171\n00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.830\nTask c takes an hour and\na half, there's three hours.\n\n172\n00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:19.630\nBut let's say that task a, okay,\nwe go ahead and we do that one.\n\n173\n00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:24.150\nBut then we got smart and we said, let me\ngo ahead and just start task b and c and\n\n174\n00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.720\nmaybe even d at the same time.\n\n175\n00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.740\nEach one of those tasks essentially will\ntake an hour and a half, but because I\n\n176\n00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.090\nhave started them, start to start,\nin other words, simultaneously here.\n\n177\n00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.480\nWell, we're just stacking them.\n\n178\n00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.440\nAnd so the same duration is gonna happen,\nbut it's gonna happen simultaneously.\n\n179\n00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.390\nI'm not getting rid of any\nof the work here, right.\n\n180\n00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.800\nIf you add up task a,\nthere's an hour and a half.\n\n181\n00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.750\nTask b, there's an hour and a half.\n\n182\n00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.060\nTask c, an hour and a half.\n\n183\n00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.760\nThat's four and a half hours.\n\n184\n00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.090\nThe same thing with the original schedule,\nfour and a half hours,\n\n185\n00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.330\nthe same amount of work is being done.\n\n186\n00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:02.360\nBut less elapse time in this overall\nduration when you start to take a look.\n\n187\n00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.700\nSo, when you start seeing this,\nright, so this should probably\n\n188\n00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:10.630\nmore than anything else here, should\nbe what we call lapsed timing, okay.\n\n189\n00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:16.209\nAnd this one here is also\nthe same thing instead.\n\n190\n00:11:16.209 --> 00:11:21.034\nThe overall time that it takes to complete\nas far as the duration length goes or\n\n191\n00:11:21.034 --> 00:11:22.296\nthe length of time,\n\n192\n00:11:22.296 --> 00:11:27.090\nis that this one down here at the bottom\nis gonna happen a lot quicker.\n\n193\n00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:31.800\nSo if you actually can do some of\nthe stuff, that is kinda the key.\n\n194\n00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.250\nNow, what is it that holds\nus to being able to do that?\n\n195\n00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.130\nWell one thing, Wes,\n\n196\n00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.690\nthat we can actually talk out here is,\nis this actually possible?\n\n197\n00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:41.450\nThat's actually the key thing.\n\n198\n00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.043\nSo is it a possibility that I\ncan do something like this?\n\n199\n00:11:44.043 --> 00:11:46.251\nAnd I look back on scenario, yes.\n\n200\n00:11:46.251 --> 00:11:49.299\nWe can start installing actually,\nif we wanted to,\n\n201\n00:11:49.299 --> 00:11:51.840\nall four servers at the same time.\n\n202\n00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.870\nI can stack all four servers, I can\nplug in the power to all four servers.\n\n203\n00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:00.170\nAnd if I have multiple copies of the\noperating system, the Microsoft Hyper V,\n\n204\n00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:03.810\nI can start the installation process\njust about at the same time.\n\n205\n00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:08.528\nIt might take the same amount of time to\ncomplete all four, but it's actually a lot\n\n206\n00:12:08.528 --> 00:12:12.870\nquicker then, right, that I do all four\nright then in that particular fashion,\n\n207\n00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:16.900\nthan if I have to start one,\nfinish it up, and then start the other.\n\n208\n00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:20.090\nBut there are some processes that\nyou can't do this with in terms of\n\n209\n00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.280\nfast tracking.\n\n210\n00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.050\nYou might find out.\n\n211\n00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.898\nLet's take for\nan example in the idea of construction.\n\n212\n00:12:24.898 --> 00:12:28.170\nWes has worked construction a bit before,\nI've worked a little bit of it.\n\n213\n00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:32.020\nBut let's say that we're actually building\na house and we're finishing up a room.\n\n214\n00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.960\nWell Wes, I know that you can actually\ndo some painting in the room but\n\n215\n00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.860\nnot until what?\n\n216\n00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.330\nThe walls are actually put up.\n\n217\n00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.200\n>> That's right.\n>> So\n\n218\n00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.740\nin that particular sense there, doing the\nidea fast tracking really doesn't help.\n\n219\n00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.384\nIf I say go ahead and paint the walls and\n\n220\n00:12:45.384 --> 00:12:47.501\nwe'll put the walls up at the same time,\nright?\n\n221\n00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:48.668\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n222\n00:12:48.668 --> 00:12:51.001\n>> Yeah, one of the things\nthat also comes to mind too,\n\n223\n00:12:51.001 --> 00:12:52.390\nis working on a concrete crew.\n\n224\n00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.550\nWe can't bring a concrete\ntruck out there and\n\n225\n00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:58.590\nstart pouring concrete before we\nbuild the frame of the foundation.\n\n226\n00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.640\nThey might not to think\ntoo highly on that.\n\n227\n00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.410\n>> Right, and so\nwhen you start thinking about that,\n\n228\n00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.780\nthat's one of the logical things you've\ngot to think about as a project manager.\n\n229\n00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:06.850\nIt might look like, yeah.\n\n230\n00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.430\nI see those three task in\nthe elapsed time that it takes.\n\n231\n00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:14.410\nAnd maybe I can actually start a couple\nof things at the same time, but you\n\n232\n00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:18.950\nhave to make sure that those particular\ntask lend itself to that ability to do so.\n\n233\n00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:22.190\nTo try and do this when it\ndoesn't logically make sense, or\n\n234\n00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:25.070\nwhen you physically can't like\nthe example that Wes used here.\n\n235\n00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.200\nWell then we're gonna be\nin trouble if we go, no,\n\n236\n00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.760\njust go ahead and start those\ntwo processes at the same time.\n\n237\n00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.530\nIt would be silly of us to try and\n\n238\n00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:35.550\ndo that, because people will get confused\nabout how they're supposed to do that.\n\n239\n00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.280\nAnd in the end, they'll actually just\nfall in line with whatever their logic\n\n240\n00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.270\nis gonna be.\n\n241\n00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:42.300\nAnd then you wont be able to account for\nthat time, as well.\n\n242\n00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.745\nSo being able to understand\nthe issues with fast tracking, and\n\n243\n00:13:45.745 --> 00:13:49.515\nthe scenario that you would also find\nthat in, is the key idea for us,\n\n244\n00:13:49.515 --> 00:13:54.001\nif we are going to do something like that,\nthen make it happen a little bit faster.\n\n245\n00:13:54.001 --> 00:13:59.069\nAnd that way we're saving a bit of time,\nto help us to keep on schedule,\n\n246\n00:13:59.069 --> 00:14:03.043\nis what fast tracking really\nits ultimate goal is to do.\n\n247\n00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:05.230\nAnd that's what we saw in that scenario,\nright?\n\n248\n00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:10.220\nHelp us to save time is actually\nthe key when we start seeing that.\n\n249\n00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.680\nSo fast tracking is\na great thing to happen.\n\n250\n00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:17.090\nIt's a lot easier to go through your\nentire project plan and to look for\n\n251\n00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:17.820\nthose things.\n\n252\n00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.200\nAnd then go, all right,\nthese two can start together.\n\n253\n00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.920\nBut if you're a novice project manager,\n\n254\n00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.070\nyou do wanna make sure that you\ntake the time to figure that out.\n\n255\n00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:28.510\nWhen you start using something\nlike Microsoft Project again,\n\n256\n00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.660\nit's easy to go down through there and\ngo, no, these two tasks are linked,\n\n257\n00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:36.070\nthe finish to start in the way that they\nnormally would be, cuz that's the default.\n\n258\n00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:39.320\nYou do, you just kinda go through\neach particular pair that you want to\n\n259\n00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.710\nsee what will happen,\nand then you can try and\n\n260\n00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.780\ndo that kinda start,\nthat simultaneous start that you need to.\n\n261\n00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.550\nAnd so it really does help you out\nwhen you can visually see it and\n\n262\n00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.126\nthat's why I showed you this here.\n\n263\n00:14:50.126 --> 00:14:54.037\n>> Yeah, you know I worked for a carpentry\ncrew that used that example that you go\n\n264\n00:14:54.037 --> 00:14:55.790\nthere of fast tracking, Ronnie.\n\n265\n00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.970\nBecause we worked in a subdivision and\nwe needed to get the subdivision done at\n\n266\n00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.980\nthe same time, but\nyou're only a single crew, right?\n\n267\n00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.443\nSo what the carpentry crew would\ndo is they'd have one house,\n\n268\n00:15:04.443 --> 00:15:06.585\nthe tress package had just showed up.\n\n269\n00:15:06.585 --> 00:15:07.790\nNothing's been done.\n\n270\n00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.330\nThen they'd have another house where\nthe bottom floor's been done, and\n\n271\n00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.310\nthe third house, bottom and\ntop floor has been constructed.\n\n272\n00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:15.940\nAnd maybe on the last one we're\ngoing back and doing the punchout.\n\n273\n00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:19.860\nSo essentially you have four houses\nall being built at the same time,\n\n274\n00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:24.040\nsame amount of man hours, but some of\nthem are getting done at the same time.\n\n275\n00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.700\n>> Yeah, and\nthat's what you're hoping for, right.\n\n276\n00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.770\nSo there's a lot of times where\nyou'll see that just because of time\n\n277\n00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:30.950\ncrunches, that happens.\n\n278\n00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.850\nAnd that's why this really does save time,\nis the ability to do fast tracking.\n\n279\n00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:37.340\nNow, when you do only\nfast tracking though,\n\n280\n00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.610\nremember what can also end\nup happening here too.\n\n281\n00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:44.565\nIs that you might find out that even\nthough this fast tracks this particular\n\n282\n00:15:44.565 --> 00:15:49.213\nactivity that you're doing right here, it\ndoesn't actually mean that the activities\n\n283\n00:15:49.213 --> 00:15:51.750\nthat follow can fall right behind that,\nokay?\n\n284\n00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.592\nSo we'll go back, let's go back to\nWes' example just for a moment.\n\n285\n00:15:55.592 --> 00:15:59.802\nWes and his crew finishes up those\nhouses the way that he wants to.\n\n286\n00:15:59.802 --> 00:16:03.757\nAnd what he expects, right,\nis that once that's finished, okay,\n\n287\n00:16:03.757 --> 00:16:07.250\nthat the next crew that's supposed\nto put in whatever it is.\n\n288\n00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:08.580\nThe electrical or the plumbing or\n\n289\n00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:12.020\nwhatever it is,\nis ready to go as soon as Wes is finished.\n\n290\n00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:16.310\nSo even though Wes and his crew were able\nto do the fast tracking on the majority of\n\n291\n00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:19.269\nthe build and do all of the stuff\nthat needed to be done.\n\n292\n00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:20.134\nNow he's like, all right I'm done,\ngo ahead plumbing,\n\n293\n00:16:20.134 --> 00:16:20.743\ngo ahead electrical and start working.\n\n294\n00:16:20.743 --> 00:16:24.681\nAnd now as he calls them,\nthey're like, well,\n\n295\n00:16:24.681 --> 00:16:28.400\nwe weren't schedule to come out for\na week.\n\n296\n00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.860\nWe're still working on another\nconstruction site over here.\n\n297\n00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.150\nSo even though you can fast\ntrack some activities,\n\n298\n00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.528\nit doesn't necessarily\nshorten the overall duration,\n\n299\n00:16:39.528 --> 00:16:45.270\nexcuse me [LAUGH] duration of\nthe entire of the entire project.\n\n300\n00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:48.270\nSo that's why fast track,\nit looks great right?\n\n301\n00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.790\nOn paper when you take a look at it,\nman gosh,\n\n302\n00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:55.130\nI'm gonna save two days of time here or\nthree hours of time on this one day.\n\n303\n00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.611\nAnd you go,\nman that's cool when you can do that.\n\n304\n00:16:57.611 --> 00:17:01.790\nBut it doesn't actually do the whole thing\nfor everything else, because you do it.\n\n305\n00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:05.325\nEspecially if you have constrained\nresources that are working on multiple\n\n306\n00:17:05.325 --> 00:17:06.830\nprojects at the same.\n\n307\n00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:10.030\nSo, unless you can schedule\nthings in which that can happen.\n\n308\n00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.650\nSo, that's another thing\nyou might take a look at.\n\n309\n00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.540\nCan this task against our simultaneously?\n\n310\n00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:19.290\nAnd even if they do,\ncan the next task go ahead and begin and\n\n311\n00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:20.970\nthen start saving time as well.\n\n312\n00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.900\nIt takes a lot more coordination\nthan it sounds, and\n\n313\n00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.800\nmy drawing doesn't actually explain that.\n\n314\n00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.940\n>> Well Ronnie, that's a great point too,\nbecause I'll give you a classic example\n\n315\n00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.778\nwhere fast tracking\nwouldn't have helped us.\n\n316\n00:17:30.778 --> 00:17:32.360\nWe have got four buildings and\n\n317\n00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.402\nwe don't have a wood package\ndelivery on any one of them.\n\n318\n00:17:35.402 --> 00:17:37.897\nSo now we still,\nI mean we're there, we're ready,\n\n319\n00:17:37.897 --> 00:17:40.890\nwe could implement this if we had\nthe material, but the stage and\n\n320\n00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:44.994\nthe step that's prior to us, that's just\nprevious, to us hasn't been completed, so\n\n321\n00:17:44.994 --> 00:17:48.310\nunfortunately, we're not\nreally short in any duration.\n\n322\n00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:51.250\n>> Yeah, so you will see\ninstances like that as well and so\n\n323\n00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.950\nthat's the kind of key.\n\n324\n00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:55.795\nNow the second scenario that I have, and\n\n325\n00:17:55.795 --> 00:18:00.910\nlet's see if Wes can actually notice\nif there is any similarities here.\n\n326\n00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:05.141\nYour project requires that you have four\nservers with Microsoft Hyper-V installed\n\n327\n00:18:05.141 --> 00:18:07.160\nfor a virtualization cluster.\n\n328\n00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.320\nThe installation will be identical with\na few minor configuration differences.\n\n329\n00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.750\nYou have a single resource\nworking on this installation.\n\n330\n00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.910\nWhat technique can we use to save time\non the installation of the four servers?\n\n331\n00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:18.310\nIt kind of sounds like identical,\ndoesn't it.\n\n332\n00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.989\n>> It really does.\n\n333\n00:18:18.989 --> 00:18:20.170\n>> It really does.\n\n334\n00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:24.010\nAnd what you'll find out is something\nlike this too, is that all of that stuff\n\n335\n00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:27.000\nthat we're talking about,\nyou'll probably find more than one answer.\n\n336\n00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.520\nNow, I hate that,\nI really hate the fact that\n\n337\n00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.820\nyou can actually have more than one\nright answer to a scenario that's given.\n\n338\n00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.920\nBut that is the absolute truth here,\nand so what do you actually need?\n\n339\n00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.260\nA lot of times what you'll hope for,\n\n340\n00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.820\nright, is just a little bit more\ninformation in which mine didn't give you.\n\n341\n00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.770\nBut at this particular point here,\n\n342\n00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.810\nthere's actually two ways that this can\nactually help us out a little bit, right?\n\n343\n00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.210\nSo, we just talked about fast tracking.\n\n344\n00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.660\nYou saw the benefit of of doing that,\nokay?\n\n345\n00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.238\nAnd it really is all about time saving,\nand\n\n346\n00:18:56.238 --> 00:18:59.700\nso this one days save\nthe idea of time here, okay.\n\n347\n00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:05.580\nNow what your hoping for on this one,\nis that at the end of this here, on this\n\n348\n00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:10.340\nparticular scenario, what technique can\nwe use to save time on the installation?\n\n349\n00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:11.190\nAnd something like this.\n\n350\n00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.208\nNow, this is actually a little\nbit more extreme here.\n\n351\n00:19:13.208 --> 00:19:18.689\nAnd cost doesn't matter, okay?\n\n352\n00:19:18.689 --> 00:19:22.032\nIn other words,\nexpend all the money that you need to, but\n\n353\n00:19:22.032 --> 00:19:24.510\njust make sure that time is saved, right.\n\n354\n00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:27.520\nSo just the addition of\nthat little extra and\n\n355\n00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.450\nthere with those actual words\nthat the cost doesn't matter.\n\n356\n00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:36.440\nAt this particular point we may also find\nout that what would really help us to save\n\n357\n00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:41.940\ntime is not that we get one particular\nperson to start all four of those but\n\n358\n00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:47.260\nwhat we can do instead is what we\ncall crashing the schedule, okay.\n\n359\n00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.975\nNow, when we start talking about\nthe idea of crashing the schedule,\n\n360\n00:19:50.975 --> 00:19:53.099\nwe can line up the same exact scenario.\n\n361\n00:19:53.099 --> 00:19:56.530\nI have four servers that\nneed this to be done.\n\n362\n00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.990\nI can get one person to\nstart installing it but\n\n363\n00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:03.320\nwhat might actually be faster though\ndepending on the actual task itself is,\n\n364\n00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:08.110\nwhat if I can get two people\nworking on that same task as well?\n\n365\n00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.590\nWell this now breaks down for\n\n366\n00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:14.480\nyou to actually trying to determine what\ntasks are what we call effort driven, and\n\n367\n00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.670\nwhat are the tasks that\nare not effort driven as well.\n\n368\n00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:21.550\nSo let's take for example,\na not effort driven task, okay.\n\n369\n00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:25.430\nSo right before the show started\nI was talking to Wes about this\n\n370\n00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:26.380\njust a little bit.\n\n371\n00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.210\nIf we think about it, right?\n\n372\n00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.620\nIf we talk about the idea\nof baking the cake, okay?\n\n373\n00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.870\nWes can be the fastest person in the world\nat mixing up every single ingredient.\n\n374\n00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.908\nAnd I know Wes cooks,\nthat's why I'm picking on him about this.\n\n375\n00:20:37.908 --> 00:20:39.313\nAnd I cook, but I'm not fast.\n\n376\n00:20:39.313 --> 00:20:41.762\nBut Wes can be the fastest\nperson on the planet.\n\n377\n00:20:41.762 --> 00:20:45.971\nAnd let's say that we work together, and\nwe actually are able to whip up the batter\n\n378\n00:20:45.971 --> 00:20:48.484\nfor a cake let's say within two minutes,\nokay.\n\n379\n00:20:48.484 --> 00:20:51.410\nWes then goes and turns the actual\noven on, I'm gonna say to 350,\n\n380\n00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:53.187\nI don't know exactly what temperature.\n\n381\n00:20:53.187 --> 00:20:55.210\nLet's say 350 right?\n\n382\n00:20:55.210 --> 00:21:00.120\nBut now that we've poured it into the pans\nand we put it into the oven Wes and\n\n383\n00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.020\nI can just be standing around.\n\n384\n00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:06.420\nThe task of actual baking is\nnot an effort driven task.\n\n385\n00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.550\nNow the task in terms of us\nmixing all the batter and\n\n386\n00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:12.210\nall the ingredients together,\nthat was effort driven.\n\n387\n00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.250\nThe two of us working together,\nwe were able to make up these matches\n\n388\n00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.410\nreally quickly and\npull everything together.\n\n389\n00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:19.720\nBut the idea of baking.\n\n390\n00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.690\nIf both Wes and\nI stare at the oven really hard,\n\n391\n00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:25.780\nit's not going to scare the cake\ninto baking any faster.\n\n392\n00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.108\nSo that is not an effort driven task.\n\n393\n00:21:28.108 --> 00:21:32.060\nSo if you're gonna crash the project plan,\nwhat your actually saying here is that you\n\n394\n00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:37.300\nneed to find out, one, what effort driven\ntask are on my schedule that I can crash.\n\n395\n00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:41.770\nThe idea of effort driven means\nthat if I add in more resources,\n\n396\n00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:45.910\nthe extra resource will essentially\nshorten the duration of that task.\n\n397\n00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:48.760\nSo that is what an effort driven\ntask actually means for us.\n\n398\n00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.489\nSo let's take a look\nhere again on my diagram.\n\n399\n00:21:52.489 --> 00:21:55.520\nAnd so now look, task a,\nlet's just say I assigned Daniel to it and\n\n400\n00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.170\nhe did it by himself, is fine.\n\n401\n00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:02.220\nTask b was fine, but if I know that\ntask c is an effort driven task,\n\n402\n00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.320\nwhat that means if I assign Daniel and\n\n403\n00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:09.400\nWes to that task, that the task\nduration will end up being shorter.\n\n404\n00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:14.170\nSo you can see task c was this long,\ntask c down here is shorter.\n\n405\n00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.700\nBut look at what happens even\nwhen I shorten one of those.\n\n406\n00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.280\nThat the overall length, right?\n\n407\n00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.120\nThe elapsed time and\n\n408\n00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:24.140\nthe duration of all of three of\nthose is now also shorter as well.\n\n409\n00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:28.080\nSo crashing helps but now notice though,\nI'm not only paying for\n\n410\n00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.980\none person working on that task.\n\n411\n00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:31.690\nAnd now paying for two, and\n\n412\n00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:36.400\nthat's why adding in that money element is\na big element that we've got to consider.\n\n413\n00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.920\nSo if we think about it, there\nare times when we have to this right.\n\n414\n00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:43.760\nThe idea of saying look, we've gotta\nfinish this house by the end of the week,\n\n415\n00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:47.040\nand let's say that Wes is the is actually\nthe crew foreman, and when I say Wes we've\n\n416\n00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:51.150\ngotta finish this and Wes says, if you\ngive me five more people I'll do it.\n\n417\n00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.448\nAnd so\nthat means that I have to actually go,\n\n418\n00:22:54.448 --> 00:22:56.679\nwhat's this telling me\nthat this is based on.\n\n419\n00:22:56.679 --> 00:22:59.303\nIt's based on labor,\nit's based on effort that's being done.\n\n420\n00:22:59.303 --> 00:23:03.273\nAnd that he doesn't have enough people\nscheduled to do all the work that needs to\n\n421\n00:23:03.273 --> 00:23:05.720\nbe completed by the end of the week.\n\n422\n00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.800\nWell at that point I\nhave to actually decide,\n\n423\n00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.060\nis that actually going\nto be worth it then?\n\n424\n00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.670\nIf cost is not a matter but\n\n425\n00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:16.450\nfinishing by the end of this week is,\nthen crashing might actually be much more\n\n426\n00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:20.870\neffective than just trying to fast\ntrack a couple of activities, okay?\n\n427\n00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.960\nSo when we start seeing some of that,\nright?\n\n428\n00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:28.070\nSo we've actually gone through the idea of\nfast tracking as well as a crashing and\n\n429\n00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:29.910\nthose two scenarios, right?\n\n430\n00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.350\nWill probably help us out now remember,\nit actually was the same scenario but\n\n431\n00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:36.910\nthe only thing we did on the second\none is what we add another element in.\n\n432\n00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:40.480\nSo remember with crashing you have to\nconsider a couple of things, right.\n\n433\n00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.830\nOne, is that task actually\nan effort driven task?\n\n434\n00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:48.510\nIf it's not,\nyou assign 15 people to I guess what?\n\n435\n00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.020\nIt doesn't matter okay?\n\n436\n00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.641\nSo you have to actually go through\nyour project plan and look for\n\n437\n00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:54.131\nthe one's that are effort driven.\n\n438\n00:23:54.131 --> 00:23:57.637\nAnd then at that point,\nonce you actually get that in hand, and\n\n439\n00:23:57.637 --> 00:24:00.164\nnow you can actually\ncombine them together.\n\n440\n00:24:00.164 --> 00:24:02.256\nFast tracking and crashing, right?\n\n441\n00:24:02.256 --> 00:24:06.877\nI added two people to that, and\nnow Wes takes the idea here,\n\n442\n00:24:06.877 --> 00:24:10.750\nof starting and installing on two servers.\n\n443\n00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:14.560\nDaniel takes the idea and actually starts\nand installs those two servers, and\n\n444\n00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.620\nthey both work together, and\nthey bring it all together and\n\n445\n00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.690\nactually get it installed, and\nnow we've actually stacked\n\n446\n00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:24.880\nthose activities together, crashed it,\nmade it a little bit more expensive, but\n\n447\n00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.920\nmore than likely the duration of that\ntask became much easier and much quicker.\n\n448\n00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.930\n>> And you can see in the scenario where\nmaybe Ronnie you're doing updates right?\n\n449\n00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.890\nSome of you guys have done updates,\nyou know what it's like,\n\n450\n00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:39.320\nyou're just waiting forever,\njust downloading, can't speed it up.\n\n451\n00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.520\nYou can slow it down for sure,\nbut you can't speed it up.\n\n452\n00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.947\nAnd if he was to put Dan and\nI into updating a server right,\n\n453\n00:24:45.947 --> 00:24:50.480\nwell adding two people to one button\nclick when you're waiting three hours for\n\n454\n00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.410\nan update,\nthat's not gonna speed anything up,\n\n455\n00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:55.120\nand most likely in can be\na waste of resources too.\n\n456\n00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.470\n>> It really can.\n\n457\n00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:58.400\nNow we're going to talk about\nsomething that doesn't seem like it\n\n458\n00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.560\nactually shortens anything up, but\n\n459\n00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.920\nit does help us to save in other\nelements in our project too, and\n\n460\n00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.730\nit also helps us to save a lot of headache\nfor people working on our project.\n\n461\n00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.280\nLet's take a look at our\nthird scenario here, okay?\n\n462\n00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:16.680\nIn this particular scenario, your\nproject budget is very tight after some\n\n463\n00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.520\nunforeseen expenses\nearly on in the project.\n\n464\n00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.260\nYou need to try and\n\n465\n00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:25.090\nmake sure you're not paying overtime\non any remaining work package.\n\n466\n00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:29.910\nYou're ahead of schedule, so\nyou do not mind losing a day or two.\n\n467\n00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:35.110\nWhat technique can help you to make sure\nthat the work gets done without overtime?\n\n468\n00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.310\nNow on this one, notice the elements\nthat we're talking about here.\n\n469\n00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:43.340\nWe're not talking about saving time\nanymore, and we're not really even\n\n470\n00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:47.630\nfocusing in on the fact that our project's\nnot going to get done, or anything like\n\n471\n00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:51.620\nthat, so we're not worried about this\nscope of the quality requirement here.\n\n472\n00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.880\nWhat we're actually worried about\nat this particular point in time\n\n473\n00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.730\nis the cost, right?\n\n474\n00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:00.040\nSo when you're focusing in\non cost such as overtime,\n\n475\n00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.770\novertime can actually account for a lot of\nwhat your budget can get ending up doing.\n\n476\n00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:06.290\nAnd so what can you do there?\n\n477\n00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:08.130\nThere is something that we call delaying.\n\n478\n00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:13.550\nNow inside of what we've also\ncovered before here in this area,\n\n479\n00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:16.900\nwe've talked about what we call the idea\nof the critical path method and\n\n480\n00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.610\nthe critical chain method as well, okay?\n\n481\n00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:23.895\nWhat we're saying is that we can actually\nfocus in on the path, the longest duration\n\n482\n00:26:23.895 --> 00:26:27.730\nthrough our entire project, but that\ndoesn't take into account resources that\n\n483\n00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:31.940\nneed to be assigned here, and a lot of\ntimes on resources they are limited,\n\n484\n00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.960\nin other words they can only work so\nmany hours a day.\n\n485\n00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.940\nSo the only way that you get around that\nis by paying things like overtime and\n\n486\n00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.500\nthat works as long as you have\nall the money in the world.\n\n487\n00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.960\nBut notice that in our particular\n\n488\n00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.660\nsituation that we've given the scenario\nis that we don't have that option.\n\n489\n00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.790\nIt's saying very tight,\nwe got to make sure no overtime happens.\n\n490\n00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:54.750\nSo, let's go ahead and take a look\nat a couple of different elements.\n\n491\n00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:59.490\nSo, let's say here on the top,\non top of the dotted line here, here is\n\n492\n00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:03.440\nthe schedule for one of my resources and\nI can say it's Wes if I wanted to.\n\n493\n00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:07.815\nSo, if Wes in these first three days\nare assigned to all these task here,\n\n494\n00:27:07.815 --> 00:27:10.660\nnow we notice that Wes has\nan eight hour work day, and\n\n495\n00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.620\nthat's what this red line\nactually indicates here.\n\n496\n00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.880\nA little bit of a small red line,\nlet me make it a little bit larger there.\n\n497\n00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:19.890\nOkay, that red line actually indicates\nthe end of his 8 hour work day, but\n\n498\n00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:25.910\nnotice that task D and task F, they\nessentially are saying that on Tuesday,\n\n499\n00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:29.580\nWes's looks like it's working about\n10 hours a day, and let's say on\n\n500\n00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.720\nWednesday though, it looks like Wes is\nactually doing 12 to 16 hours, okay?\n\n501\n00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.640\nPretty good overtime there, Wes-\n>> That's right.\n\n502\n00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.550\n>> That you're actually getting.\n\n503\n00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:41.890\nIt sounds great, except that if you\ncontinue to do this on every single task,\n\n504\n00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:45.970\nor on every single day that Wes has, after\na while he's gonna get tired of it, and\n\n505\n00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:49.900\nhe's not gonna wanna do some of these\ntasks, even if it's overtime, right?\n\n506\n00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.470\nSo, what can you do?\n\n507\n00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:55.390\nIf this were me and I was saying, look I\ngotta actually get rid of this overtime,\n\n508\n00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:57.520\nthere's only really one\nelement that I can do and\n\n509\n00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.380\nthat's called delaying essentially, okay?\n\n510\n00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.250\nDelaying though doesn't mean that\nyou're actually telling Wes to work\n\n511\n00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:04.760\nany less, okay?\n\n512\n00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.680\nThe overall time factor\nis actually still there.\n\n513\n00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.840\nYou add up all the time in these elements\nhere, they still have to be true for\n\n514\n00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.560\nWes regardless.\n\n515\n00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.550\nSo, now if you take a look\nat the bottom here, after\n\n516\n00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:20.560\nactually implementing some type of delay,\nwhat we actually end up doing is this.\n\n517\n00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:24.400\nNotice that task D was split over 2 days.\n\n518\n00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.010\nSo we worked Wes on Tuesday all\nthe way up to that eight hour day, But\n\n519\n00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:33.710\nthen on Wednesday, we took task E and\nhe's also finishing up task D as well.\n\n520\n00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.920\nThen whatever he was supposed\nto do on Wednesday though,\n\n521\n00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:40.190\nnotice that got pushed to Thursday.\n\n522\n00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:43.020\nSo it actually did delay a little bit,\nright?\n\n523\n00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:47.934\nSo the overall duration that he had\nhere was actually three days in terms of\n\n524\n00:28:47.934 --> 00:28:52.070\nworking his task as a resource and\nnow it's turned into four.\n\n525\n00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:55.090\nIf you count up the same number of hours,\n\n526\n00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:59.690\nyou'll see it's actually the same\nduration overall in terms of work, okay?\n\n527\n00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:03.900\nBut notice that it's actually the time\ndifference here where that delay helped,\n\n528\n00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:08.330\nand now that I have him not working\nany overtime he's still accomplishing\n\n529\n00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:12.620\nthe work that needs to be done, where\nwe've now leveled him as a resource and\n\n530\n00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.550\nthe only thing we've done here is\nadd in an extra day to his working.\n\n531\n00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:19.880\nNow that may work as long as he\ndoesn't have any other constraints,\n\n532\n00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.830\nlike that Thursday he was supposed\nto work on a different project, but\n\n533\n00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:27.640\neven if he did, we would essentially take\ntask F, and we would push it out to his\n\n534\n00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:33.120\nnext available free day that he had, that\nhe could work on another task as well.\n\n535\n00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.900\nSo, it does allow us to do that.\n\n536\n00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:39.030\nBut that time limit or\nthat time added in can stretch out a lot\n\n537\n00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:44.010\nfurther than we realize, so\nin this particular scenario then,\n\n538\n00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:47.960\nwhat you have to actually look out for is\nwhat is that constraint requirement there?\n\n539\n00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:51.820\nDelaying really does help us out\nespecially in a situation like this.\n\n540\n00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:56.760\nSometimes we do work with time constraints\nin which we can't do anything about.\n\n541\n00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:00.570\nLet's say for an example that even though\nwe've scheduled somebody to start working,\n\n542\n00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:02.730\nlet's say on Thursday, we call them and\n\n543\n00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:05.600\nthey say look,\nI can't really make it until Friday.\n\n544\n00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.940\nWell, that means that even Thursday we\nwouldn't actually be able to do that and\n\n545\n00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:12.730\nwe would essentially take that and then\nmove that over there to Friday instead,\n\n546\n00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:14.960\nand that's what ended up happening.\n\n547\n00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.820\nSo these things can actually be\n\n548\n00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:21.620\npushing us around a little bit especially\nwith delay because what you're looking for\n\n549\n00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:25.970\nin delay is essentially the next\navailable free day that they have.\n\n550\n00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.620\nAnd even if it doesn't show\nup in your project plan,\n\n551\n00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:33.710\nit may show up where he was working\non Daniel's project on Thursday and\n\n552\n00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:37.040\nDaniel just didn't schedule\nit with you to let you know.\n\n553\n00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:42.400\nBut you had originally said, no, Wes\nhas a job that's finished on Wednesday,\n\n554\n00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.920\nthat you don't worry about it, well\nnow you go, I'm gonna schedule Wes for\n\n555\n00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.860\nThursday and Daniel goes, whoa,\nwait a minute you can't do that.\n\n556\n00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:53.960\nAnd so now you have to actually\ncoordinate around that a little bit more.\n\n557\n00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:58.480\nBut all three of these plans, all three of\nthese ways that we can deal essentially\n\n558\n00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:02.600\nwith optimizing our schedule are some of\nthe concepts that we need to understand.\n\n559\n00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.610\nIf you're using a project\ninformation system,\n\n560\n00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:09.690\nwell a lot of this will be taking care for\nyou, at least it will be pointed out when\n\n561\n00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:13.140\nyou do things like over-allocation\nas well that will tell you that,\n\n562\n00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:17.080\nhey, this resource is actually\nover-allocated at this point in time,\n\n563\n00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.460\nyou may need to do some\nresource leveling here.\n\n564\n00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.610\nAnd it can automatically\ntake care of it for\n\n565\n00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:25.710\nyou if you actually choose to do that,\nokay?\n\n566\n00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:29.930\nBut it's not gonna automatically do it cuz\nit doesn't wanna make decisions for you.\n\n567\n00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:33.610\nThese are all decision that have to be\nmade by you as a project manager and\n\n568\n00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:37.970\nthat is another key, so make sure you\ntake a look at several scenarios here and\n\n569\n00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:41.170\nyou're gonna realize that any one of\nthem will actually work so look for\n\n570\n00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:43.390\nthe elements that differentiate them.\n\n571\n00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:45.593\nIf you do end up seeing a couple\nscenarios and you're like,\n\n572\n00:31:45.593 --> 00:31:50.600\nman that was just about identical to what\nI saw before here, well just realize\n\n573\n00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.470\nthat there's something that's gonna set\nit up just a little bit differently.\n\n574\n00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:55.750\nBut if it doesn't, right?\n\n575\n00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:57.820\nEither one of those answers\nwill probably work for\n\n576\n00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.810\nyou regardless of which\none you end up choosing.\n\n577\n00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:03.710\nSo Wes, that's pretty much all\nthat I really have on the idea of\n\n578\n00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:04.830\nresource leveling here.\n\n579\n00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:05.560\n>> All right, very good.\n\n580\n00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:09.420\nSo in this episode, remember we've looked\nat optimization through resource leveling.\n\n581\n00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.280\nRemember the three types\nthat Ronnie showed you.\n\n582\n00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.190\nWe had fast tracking, crashing, and delay.\n\n583\n00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.260\nRonnie, thank you for\nall that information,\n\n584\n00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:19.120\nand thank you guys

00:00:16.512\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n4\n00:00:16.512 --> 00:00:20.590\nAnd in today's episode, we're gonna be\ncontinuing along in our Project+ training.\n\n5\n00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.040\nAnd I've got none other than\nRonnie Wong in the studio with me.\n\n6\n00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.270\nRonnie, how you doing sir?\n\n7\n00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.319\nWell, thank you for\n\n8\n00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:29.270\nhaving me back as we continue on in\nour CompTIA Project+ series here.\n\n9\n00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.400\nWhat we're doing today is we're\ngonna take a look at the idea of\n\n10\n00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.230\nusing quality assurance.\n\n11\n00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.080\nNow, during our planning phase,\n\n12\n00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.700\nwe talked about the idea of what\nthe quality assurance is about.\n\n13\n00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.970\nNow we have to make sure that as we are\nnow in the execution and monitoring and\n\n14\n00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.020\ncontrolling side of things, that we\nunderstand what we're actually doing when\n\n15\n00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.240\nwe start talking about\nthe idea of quality assurance.\n\n16\n00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.780\nRemember that when we take a look at our\nproject and its overall deliverables and\n\n17\n00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.430\nwe're wanting, is that we don't\nwanna just produce something.\n\n18\n00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.900\nWe don't want to just have unique\nresult and a service or product or\n\n19\n00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.880\nwhatever it is.\n\n20\n00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.530\nWe want a result, a product, or\na service that we really want to produce.\n\n21\n00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.660\nIn other words, one of high quality.\n\n22\n00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.360\nAnd for us to ensure something like that,\n\n23\n00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.260\nit's not just getting done\nfrom point A to point B.\n\n24\n00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.130\nIt's just not making sure that we actually\nare marking off checklists a lot of times.\n\n25\n00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.470\nThose things will help.\n\n26\n00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.310\nBut the overall goal, right, is so\n\n27\n00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.180\nthat we actually do produce whatever\nit is that we were going to make out of\n\n28\n00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.910\nour project here, something that\nactually has a high quality value to it.\n\n29\n00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.120\nAnd the way that we do that,\na lot of times, in the manufacturing\n\n30\n00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.220\nprocess of things, we're not even\ntalking about project management yet,\n\n31\n00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.580\nis we introduce what we call, and\nyou'll hear the terms here, QAQC.\n\n32\n00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.370\nThe idea of quality assurance and\nquality control.\n\n33\n00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.100\nWell when we take a look at both those say\nthose sound very similar to each other,\n\n34\n00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.180\nbut they are actually different processes\nthat we have in place here, to ensure\n\n35\n00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.340\nthat the quality product that we want\nactually does get produced in the end.\n\n36\n00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.140\nSo when we take a look at the realm and\nthe concepts of quality assurance,\n\n37\n00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.660\nwe're really talking about\nmore preventive measures\n\n38\n00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.340\nthat we can have in place as\nwe produce things, right,\n\n39\n00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.050\nthat will allow us to actually produce\nthe high quality things that we can.\n\n40\n00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.440\nAnd that's the idea of quality assurance,\nokay?\n\n41\n00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.460\nWhen we talk about quality control, we are\nreally talking about now after the fact.\n\n42\n00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.840\nWhat are the things that\nwe do to ensure to correct\n\n43\n00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.208\nthings that may have gone wrong,\nand now we have a control policy.\n\n44\n00:02:35.208 --> 00:02:38.140\nWe actually are now making\nlevels here saying,\n\n45\n00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.850\nhere's the level of quality that we are\nwilling to accept, and here's the level\n\n46\n00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.500\nthat we're really not going to accept as\nwell, and that's the idea of making sure\n\n47\n00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.420\nthat the end result here is\nof the quality that we want.\n\n48\n00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.730\nSo the assurance side is\nmore about the prevention,\n\n49\n00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.650\nabout getting the structures,\ngetting everything in place for\n\n50\n00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.900\nour project to where what we\nare saying is, here’s how we know\n\n51\n00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.010\nthat we're gonna produce the highest\nquality thing that we can.\n\n52\n00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.280\nAnd then the quality control is\nactually gonna go back through,\n\n53\n00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.360\nuse some different metrics to help us out\nas far as actually being able to weed out\n\n54\n00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.240\nthe things that\nare a little bit different.\n\n55\n00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.800\nSo we wanna go through essentially\nfive different steps that we can here,\n\n56\n00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.950\nto essentially assure quality assurance\nis what we're taking a look at.\n\n57\n00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.010\nAt least on a high level overview during\nour execution on our monitoring and\n\n58\n00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.310\ncontrolling phase.\n\n59\n00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.230\nAnd so when we talked about\nthe idea of planning it out,\n\n60\n00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.610\nwe talked about the management of it,\nright?\n\n61\n00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.390\nWhat are some of the things\nthat we need to have in place.\n\n62\n00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.500\nAnd now, when it starts here and\nwe're now in the midst of our project,\n\n63\n00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.140\nwe're now actually saying, is our quality\nassurance the way that we want to?\n\n64\n00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.770\nWhat are we really looking at?\n\n65\n00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.970\nWhat we're starting to look at\nthe very beginning in our first step\n\n66\n00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.910\nof quality assurance is gonna be the idea\nof taking a look at what we call\n\n67\n00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.260\nwork performance as what we want.\n\n68\n00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.400\nSo I went ahead and created a diagram, or\n\n69\n00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.340\nkind of more than anything else here, a\nlist of some of the things that we need to\n\n70\n00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.400\nensure if we are gonna have some type\nof high quality in our product and\n\n71\n00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.850\nwhatever we're doing for\nour project here, okay?\n\n72\n00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.050\nWhat we wanna do when we talk\nabout this idea of course,\n\n73\n00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.270\nis monitor the overall work performance.\n\n74\n00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.840\nNow remember that this actually does,\nit is part of quality assurance.\n\n75\n00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.640\nIf our work performance is poor,\nthe chances\n\n76\n00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.350\nof whatever quality that we're working\non is actually gonna be poor as well.\n\n77\n00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.320\nSo quality assurance for us is actually\nsaying, what is that standard,\n\n78\n00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.980\nwhat is that high level of performance\nthat we really want from everybody that's\n\n79\n00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.860\nworking on our project, and\nalso from the components that we have.\n\n80\n00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.680\nWell the way that we measure that\nright at the beginning is to insure\n\n81\n00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.150\nthat we have our proper baseline setup\n\n82\n00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.790\nto help us to measure that particular\nquality right from the beginning.\n\n83\n00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.100\nSo we may go ahead and\nwe set up things like our project cost.\n\n84\n00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.520\nAnd that we say, here's how we know,\nas far as the spending of the money goes,\n\n85\n00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.980\nthat we're gonna use whatever high quality\n\n86\n00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.530\nproducts that we're gonna put\ninto our development here.\n\n87\n00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.000\nSame thing with the scope,\n\n88\n00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.420\nmaking sure that it is something that we\ncan produce in the time that we're given.\n\n89\n00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.630\nAs well as the schedule.\n\n90\n00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.050\nDo we have enough time to\nactually produce that?\n\n91\n00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.860\nOr are we just gonna make a cheap\nknockoff and do it as quickly as we can?\n\n92\n00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.410\nSo all those are actually a part of it.\n\n93\n00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.710\nAnd then here, you can even take a look\nat the idea of project quality as well.\n\n94\n00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.080\nSo all of those are usually\nthe idea of the baselines.\n\n95\n00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.840\nIn other words, here's what we're\nactually saying that we really want\n\n96\n00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.050\nfrom the very beginning as we start.\n\n97\n00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.220\nOnce you have your baseline standards\npretty much in place at that point,\n\n98\n00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.350\nthis is now where you\nstart monitoring now,\n\n99\n00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.790\nall of the work performance and the work\ncompleted as far as the progress goes,\n\n100\n00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.330\nas well as the work completed,\nagainst the baseline.\n\n101\n00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.950\nSo, you're not actually telling people,\nyou're not meeting the baseline.\n\n102\n00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.960\nWhat you're actually doing at this point,\n\n103\n00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.750\nis you're measuring true work performed,\nand then in the end,\n\n104\n00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.760\nyou're going to compare it,\njust like I have here at the bottom.\n\n105\n00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.400\nYou're going to compare it against\nthe actual baseline itself.\n\n106\n00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.390\nSo, you're not trying to scare people\ninto performing at a higher level.\n\n107\n00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.460\nWhat you're trying to do is\nactually measure whether or\n\n108\n00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.140\nnot it is at least meeting those baseline\nstandards here to make that happen.\n\n109\n00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.420\n>> Now, Ronnie this looks a lot like,\n\n110\n00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.260\nwhen it comes to baselines,\nI've dealt with performance baselines and\n\n111\n00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.600\nsecurity baselines before and\nthe concept really does seem the same.\n\n112\n00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.950\nI need a statistical snapshot\nof where I'm at right now, so\n\n113\n00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.800\nthat as things move forward,\nI can see, has there been\n\n114\n00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.240\nany deviation from then to now, and\ndo we have to get things back on track.\n\n115\n00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.960\nSo is this fairly similar to that?\n\n116\n00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.950\n>> It really is, right?\n\n117\n00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.860\nThe same concepts that\nyou'll learn in IT security.\n\n118\n00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.120\nThat you'll learn, and\nanything else that you're actually doing,\n\n119\n00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.540\nespecially in the manufacturing world,\nit is.\n\n120\n00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.890\nIt's actually saying here is\nmy minimum quality level.\n\n121\n00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.150\nAnd I wanna make sure that everybody's\nactually at least performing\n\n122\n00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.160\nat that level.\n\n123\n00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.800\nAnd that will guarantee essentially\na certain amount of quality\n\n124\n00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.630\nthat you're actually willing to accept.\n\n125\n00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.310\nMost of us don't just\nsay just get it done.\n\n126\n00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.200\nNow don't get me wrong.\n\n127\n00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.090\nHave I said that before?\n\n128\n00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.580\nYou better believe it.\n\n129\n00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.550\nDid I really mean it?\n\n130\n00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.880\nNo, it was just frustration that came out.\n\n131\n00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.820\nUsually what we begin with, right, is\nthat we have set that particular baseline\n\n132\n00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.020\nbecause we believe this\nis what it should be for\n\n133\n00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.440\nus to generate something\nlike what we want.\n\n134\n00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.780\nSo, here at ITProTV studios,\n\n135\n00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.550\nas we started our company,\nthe goal was simple, was to get as\n\n136\n00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.660\nmuch content out there as we could, and\nproduce it at a very high quality level.\n\n137\n00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.590\nWell, when we started out and\n\n138\n00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.900\nwe did that some things where\nactually of fairly decent quality.\n\n139\n00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.758\nSome things didn't turn out as well,\nand one of the quality assurances that\n\n140\n00:07:45.758 --> 00:07:49.816\nwe wanna put in place is the consistency,\nas far as the technical quality goes.\n\n141\n00:07:49.816 --> 00:07:53.842\nAnd then even our shows today, when we\nstart taking a look at the idea of quality\n\n142\n00:07:53.842 --> 00:07:57.930\nassurance, we have the ability at any\ntime during our show if we don't like it,\n\n143\n00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.429\nwe just say, look, let's start\nthat one over again and redo that.\n\n144\n00:08:01.429 --> 00:08:05.074\nAnd that is because it has to meet some\nparticular standard that we want before\n\n145\n00:08:05.074 --> 00:08:06.040\nwe'll produce it.\n\n146\n00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.341\nAnd if we don't like it, if we don't as\npeople that are actually doing the shows\n\n147\n00:08:09.341 --> 00:08:11.320\ndon't like it, well that's kinda bad.\n\n148\n00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.070\nWe pretty much know our audience\nisn't gonna like it, so\n\n149\n00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.870\ninstead what we wanna do is\nactually produce that high level.\n\n150\n00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.420\nSo we set a particular baseline and\n\n151\n00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.670\nthen our performance from that\npoint is that we're monitoring it.\n\n152\n00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.760\nNow, not only am I watching\nthe shows afterwards,\n\n153\n00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.580\nand Wes is watching his shows, we have a\nwhole group, our entire team can watch it.\n\n154\n00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:33.790\nAnd they can look and go, Ronnie, that was\nreally bad, you should redo that show.\n\n155\n00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:35.160\nAnd we want to take the time and\n\n156\n00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.540\nconsider it if something like that ends\nup happening because what are we saying?\n\n157\n00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.580\nWe’re saying it’s not\nmeeting that baseline.\n\n158\n00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.240\nSo in that particular instance there,\nit is the same thing that you also learn\n\n159\n00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.120\nabout in IT security like\nwhat Weiss is talking about.\n\n160\n00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.720\nYou set up your security baseline and\n\n161\n00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.560\nsay here’s the minimum things\nthat we wanna make sure of, and\n\n162\n00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.400\nhere’s the level of quality we wanna\nmake sure that we’ve implemented here.\n\n163\n00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.360\nIf there’s anything that’s not meeting\nthat, we need to know about it.\n\n164\n00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.930\nAnd so we have to actually measure that\nagainst the real world stuff that we\n\n165\n00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:01.930\nhave out there.\n\n166\n00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.950\nWe don't want people to\nput up a front on it.\n\n167\n00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.040\nWe don't want people to give us\ntheir best showing right then if\n\n168\n00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.150\nthey're not really gonna perform that way.\n\n169\n00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.550\nSo being able to measure\ntheir work performance and\n\n170\n00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.340\nmonitor it in the same ways\nthat we've talked about, and\n\n171\n00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.410\nactually in every part of\nany work process that we do.\n\n172\n00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.480\nWhether it's procurement,\nwhether it's the cost,\n\n173\n00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.130\nwhether it's risk, we wanna make sure\nthat we measure everything like that,\n\n174\n00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.440\nand that way we can compare it\nagainst that original baseline.\n\n175\n00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.870\nAnd so that's why it's actually always\nimportant in your project that you do\n\n176\n00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:35.160\nset up these baseline types\nof measurements to assure or\n\n177\n00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.030\nensure the quality that\nyou want to produce.\n\n178\n00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:42.140\nSo usually that is our first step\nwhen we start talking about the idea\n\n179\n00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.717\nof quality assurance, okay.\n\n180\n00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:49.770\nSo on that one, then, we actually need\nto take a look then, after we start\n\n181\n00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:55.020\ndoing that, is what is going to be\nour second step from that, okay?\n\n182\n00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.330\nNow, this is where it gets a little bit\nmore technically challenging at times.\n\n183\n00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.350\nAnd let me just increase the font size,\njust briefly.\n\n184\n00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:07.280\nNow, we're gonna talk about some of\nthe things that we can actually do, okay.\n\n185\n00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.190\nBut we're not gonna go over any one\nparticular example and the reason why is\n\n186\n00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:15.290\nthat we have a whole episode coming\nup in the near future here about\n\n187\n00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:20.570\nevery single one of these formulas that we\nwill go over along with scenarios here.\n\n188\n00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.570\nBut what we wanna say is that when\nwe talk about quality assurance,\n\n189\n00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.270\nthen, there are certain\nmeasurements that can be done\n\n190\n00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:29.010\neven if I don't know every\nlittle intricate detail\n\n191\n00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.710\nabout what it is that I'm producing\nas far as the project goes, right?\n\n192\n00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:36.440\nAs a project manager I should know what\nit is that I want to actually produce in\n\n193\n00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.770\nthe end, but it doesn't mean I know\nevery technical detail behind it, okay.\n\n194\n00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.900\nSo let's take for\nan example here, we'll use Wes.\n\n195\n00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.590\nWes is highly certified in a lot\nof different computer skills\n\n196\n00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:48.680\nthat's actually out there.\n\n197\n00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.730\nBut it doesn't necessarily mean\nthat Wes understands everything,\n\n198\n00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.950\nlike the little electrons that\nfloat across the actual CPU,\n\n199\n00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.360\nand the direction that they go in and\nwhy they go in that particular direction.\n\n200\n00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.910\nHe might not understand\nthe electrical physics or\n\n201\n00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:05.760\nthe engineering that goes beyond that, but\ndoes that mean that he doesn't know how\n\n202\n00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.680\nthe operating system works, and\nhe doesn't know how the computer works?\n\n203\n00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.620\nNo, okay?\n\n204\n00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.300\nSo the same thing with the project\nmanager is that we know\n\n205\n00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.360\nwhat it is we're trying to get in the end,\nwe know what it's supposed to do.\n\n206\n00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.500\nBut sometimes there's actually things that\nyou can do that will actually show you\n\n207\n00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:26.250\nthat your particular project is\nactually doing as well as as it can do,\n\n208\n00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.280\nas far as the performance goes,\nto end up producing that in the very end.\n\n209\n00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:35.280\nAnd so what we talk about now then is\nwhat do we do with the data, okay?\n\n210\n00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.720\nSo now that I have my baseline,\nnow that I'm starting to monitor\n\n211\n00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.680\ntheir performance and work, how do I\ntake the information that I've learned\n\n212\n00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.820\nout of the information that I'm getting\nthrough that monitoring, and use it for\n\n213\n00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.480\nsomething that actually is gonna\nhelp me to manage the project better\n\n214\n00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.954\nto ensure that the quality of my project\nis actually gonna be as high as possible?\n\n215\n00:11:55.954 --> 00:12:00.640\nWell, the way that we do that is we take\na look at several different formulas\n\n216\n00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.260\nabout the performance of\nthe overall project, okay.\n\n217\n00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.700\nAnd if we can actually\ndo something like that,\n\n218\n00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.980\nit helps me to ensure that my project will\nactually be able to perform the way that\n\n219\n00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.598\nit needs to and the way that I\nplanned it out to do as well, okay.\n\n220\n00:12:14.598 --> 00:12:17.724\nSo we're gonna just mention\na few of these here, and\n\n221\n00:12:17.724 --> 00:12:20.704\njust kind of describe what\nthey help us to do, okay.\n\n222\n00:12:20.704 --> 00:12:24.230\nSo the first one, what we call EV,\nor the Earned Value.\n\n223\n00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:28.190\nAnd inside of CompTIA,\nthey also add an M to it for one reason or\n\n224\n00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:29.960\nanother, that's perfectly fine.\n\n225\n00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:36.190\nEarned Value Measurement is what\nthey actually have for us here.\n\n226\n00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.200\nAnd what does Earned Value Measurement\nhelp us to do?\n\n227\n00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.210\nIt helps us to determine\nthe cause of the variances.\n\n228\n00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:48.990\nNow, when we talk about cause here, the\nstuff that we plug in to the earned value\n\n229\n00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:54.180\nhere have to deal with schedule as well as\nthe cost more than anything else, right?\n\n230\n00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.770\nSo, we're actually measuring,\nesssentially, time and\n\n231\n00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:59.830\nthe cost element to help us out here.\n\n232\n00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.840\nAnd, what we're actually saying then is,\nas we do the Earned Value here,\n\n233\n00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.820\nthat a lot of the variances that come in,\nwe believe it has to do with time,\n\n234\n00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.950\nas well as the cost or\nresources that we have on hand.\n\n235\n00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:12.600\nAnd so that's what we tend\nto deal with then, okay.\n\n236\n00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.850\nIt determines if corrective action\nalso needs to be implemented.\n\n237\n00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:18.960\nBut because of the way that we\ncalculate the Earned Value,\n\n238\n00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.410\nit can show us several\ndifferent things here.\n\n239\n00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:25.170\nIf you take a look at the formula that I\nhave listed up here over to the right,\n\n240\n00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.240\nlet me see if I can highlight\nthat a little bit better.\n\n241\n00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.870\nRight here, I'll just change the color and\nmake it a little bit easier for us.\n\n242\n00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:32.960\nRight there in the yellow.\n\n243\n00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:38.900\nIs that Earned Value is actually equal to\nwhat we call the planned value, okay, and\n\n244\n00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.910\nthe percentage is actually\nat its completion, okay?\n\n245\n00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:48.010\nSo if your particular project is only 20%\ncomplete and you actually expected to only\n\n246\n00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:53.830\nspend up to $1,000 at this point during\nthe 20% complete, we can find that, right?\n\n247\n00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:58.889\nSo if you can do that,\nthat is the idea of what's going on, okay.\n\n248\n00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:03.342\nNow you might find out that you're\nactually 15% complete in all reality and\n\n249\n00:14:03.342 --> 00:14:06.785\nthen you measure it against that and\nyou realize something,\n\n250\n00:14:06.785 --> 00:14:11.255\nhey, I've already spent way too much\nmoney at this particular point in time.\n\n251\n00:14:11.255 --> 00:14:14.265\nAnd that's what gives you\nthe ability to go back and go,\n\n252\n00:14:14.265 --> 00:14:16.323\nwhere is the performance issue here?\n\n253\n00:14:16.323 --> 00:14:19.880\nWhere do I actually have to ensure\nthat better performance goes on?\n\n254\n00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.470\nDo I add in more workers, or\ndo I actually add in more resources?\n\n255\n00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.620\nWhatever it might end up being.\n\n256\n00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.130\nSo this is what will help\nyou to figure that out.\n\n257\n00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:29.670\nIf you end up where you're going,\nwait a minute,\n\n258\n00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.280\nthis is not exactly as planned,\nwell, there's a reason for that.\n\n259\n00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.430\nAnd what we've used here is\nthe Earned Value to tell us whether or\n\n260\n00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.090\nnot we actually have to\ndeal with it at that point.\n\n261\n00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:42.237\nSo, you will see things like that and\nlike I said, if you're still lost on it,\n\n262\n00:14:42.237 --> 00:14:43.250\nthat's fine.\n\n263\n00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:48.220\nWe're gonna get to that in much more depth\nwhen we hit that show on the formulas and\n\n264\n00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.290\nyou'll probably go, my gosh,\ndo we really have to learn that?\n\n265\n00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.618\nYes, you do, okay.\n\n266\n00:14:52.618 --> 00:14:56.320\nSo we'll at least hit it\na couple of times there, okay.\n\n267\n00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.340\nThe other one, of course,\nis what's called a Schedule Variance.\n\n268\n00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:03.398\nNow, when you start now this is where\nthe terms kind of become a little bit more\n\n269\n00:15:03.398 --> 00:15:05.240\nintuitive at this point.\n\n270\n00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.790\nSchedule Variance is exactly\nlike it sounds like.\n\n271\n00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:11.020\nIf you have a planned schedule, right, if\nyou go, this is how long it should take,\n\n272\n00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.110\nit's gonna take me 45 days, and\n\n273\n00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:17.980\nnow what you're trying to determine is,\nwhat is my variance at this point in time?\n\n274\n00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.420\nAm I gonna finish ahead of schedule, or\nam I gonna finish behind schedule, or\n\n275\n00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.610\nam I gonna finish right on time?\n\n276\n00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:26.660\nWell, how do you know, okay?\n\n277\n00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:31.470\nYou can sit there and say right now that\nyou're on day 15 of 45, and try and go,\n\n278\n00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:35.470\nokay, I believe that we're gonna\nfinish right here on schedule.\n\n279\n00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:39.326\nWell, the only way to actually determine\nthat is to be able to calculate that\n\n280\n00:15:39.326 --> 00:15:43.486\nEarned Value, subtract it from what that\nPlanned Value is, and that will tell you\n\n281\n00:15:43.486 --> 00:15:47.288\nwhether or not you're actually spending\nthe right amount of money for that\n\n282\n00:15:47.288 --> 00:15:51.487\nparticular point in your duration that\nyou've had during particular schedule.\n\n283\n00:15:51.487 --> 00:15:56.041\nIf you actually can end up seeing that\nas far as the time element goes a lot of\n\n284\n00:15:56.041 --> 00:15:57.217\ntimes, Whether or\n\n285\n00:15:57.217 --> 00:16:01.641\nnot at that percentage in time whether\nyou're ahead or behind as well.\n\n286\n00:16:01.641 --> 00:16:06.025\nSo again don't try and learn everything\nright now if you're just looking at these\n\n287\n00:16:06.025 --> 00:16:10.210\nfor the first time when we go over it\nwe're go over it much more detail.\n\n288\n00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:13.850\nCost variance essentially works the same\nbut take to look at the idea of cost.\n\n289\n00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:20.520\nIs my particular budget ahead of or\nbelow budget at this point in time, okay?\n\n290\n00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.760\nWhere I actually am is right on\nthe budget schedule that I actually have,\n\n291\n00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:29.140\nthere is my spending, the amount of money\nthat I expect to be spending right now or\n\n292\n00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.590\nam I spending way too much money for\n\n293\n00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:35.320\nthe time that actually spend\nright now on this project too.\n\n294\n00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:39.520\nWell, we can actually calculate that\nall out as well by using earned values,\n\n295\n00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.220\nscheduled value here,\ncost values here, or variance.\n\n296\n00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.200\nI keep saying values, variance here\nusing these particular formulas\n\n297\n00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.440\nwill help us to actually see that.\n\n298\n00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.340\nAnd, you might be wondering,\nwell, why is this important?\n\n299\n00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.080\nAnd, we'll see here in a moment,\n\n300\n00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.390\nwhich is the idea of what we\ncalled variance analysis.\n\n301\n00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:01.380\nVariance analysis and let me go and\nhighlight these other formulas.\n\n302\n00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.830\nAnd, we're gonna be coming back to this so\nthat way, we'll see this.\n\n303\n00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:09.470\nBut this is essentially,\nthese are tools that we use to help us to\n\n304\n00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:12.970\nanalyze our performance information\nthat we're normally given.\n\n305\n00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:17.580\nAnd this last one here is what we\ncall variance analysis instead.\n\n306\n00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:21.890\nNow the variance analysis at the end,\nessentially takes what we believe that\n\n307\n00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:26.660\nwe've budgeted for the entirety of\nmy project a lot of times, okay?\n\n308\n00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.400\nAnd then we take a look at what I\nactually spent on the project and\n\n309\n00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.850\nthe difference is a variance,\nis what it comes down to, okay?\n\n310\n00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:38.350\nAnd that particular variance is actually a\nmeasurement of quality a lot of times here\n\n311\n00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.580\nof the assurance.\n\n312\n00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.330\nIf I actually overspent,\n\n313\n00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:44.650\nwhat we're actually hoping to see is\nthat we know where that came from.\n\n314\n00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:45.620\nIs it that the.\n\n315\n00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.130\nProject took too long.\n\n316\n00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.890\nDo we change the scope in the project?\n\n317\n00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:53.840\nWhatever it is, that affects the overall\nquality assurance in my projects as well.\n\n318\n00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.140\nSo, we are gonna get into that and\n\n319\n00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.380\neven more what we called\nperformance indexes as well and\n\n320\n00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:03.280\nyou'll see different ratio that we have\nthat she worry about and deal with too.\n\n321\n00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:07.120\nBut, those are just some of the steps that\nyou might end up having to do on your\n\n322\n00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:11.140\nproject, as you start implementing\nsome type of quality assurance.\n\n323\n00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.440\nOkay?\n\n324\n00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.640\nAll right,\nthen we have to be able to, actually,\n\n325\n00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.100\nidentify these variances as well.\n\n326\n00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:20.180\nAnd all right, so our next step here,\nreally, kinda, the third step in\n\n327\n00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:24.160\nwhat we're doing, is we wanna talk\nabout identifying those variances.\n\n328\n00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.500\nNow, because what we're normally\ndoing as a project manager and\n\n329\n00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.500\nwhat we talked about before as\nfar as the performance things\n\n330\n00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.730\nin which we analyze the data and we can\nactually make some information out of it.\n\n331\n00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.850\nWe now need to essentially relate them,\nokay?\n\n332\n00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.300\nTo things that we really need\nto be able to relate them to.\n\n333\n00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:45.430\nIn other words it's not just enough that\nwe look at numbers and stuff like that we\n\n334\n00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:49.950\nnow need to be able to take those numbers\nand essentially point to an element okay?\n\n335\n00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.620\nPoint to something that is off track,\n\n336\n00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.740\nbe able to actually identify\nwhat's actually out there for us.\n\n337\n00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.690\nSo the way that we do that, right?\n\n338\n00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.090\nIs we take the information now and\nwe start to try to do that.\n\n339\n00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:04.610\nWell you start talking\nidentifying variances then, okay?\n\n340\n00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:09.170\nWe wanna be able to identify variances\nfrom the project plan itself.\n\n341\n00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:13.860\nAnd that means making sure that we\nare only comparing it to the base line\n\n342\n00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.910\nthat we’ve set up for our project.\n\n343\n00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.810\nDon’t sit there and look at somebody\nelse’s project, and go, man, they’re so\n\n344\n00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.220\nfar ahead, now I’m so far behind.\n\n345\n00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.990\nDo you really know that\nyou are that far behind.\n\n346\n00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:26.950\nBecause they just see like,\nthat they're not far ahead.\n\n347\n00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:32.250\nYou need to make sure that you're only\ncomparing your particular project, right?\n\n348\n00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.170\nTo your baseline.\n\n349\n00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.530\nAnd that is a key element, right?\n\n350\n00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:39.910\nThen it just that happened\nfrom your baseline is fine,\n\n351\n00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.920\nyou now need of course once\nyou identify that, right?\n\n352\n00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.150\nThat hey, this is a variance\nagainst my baseline and not\n\n353\n00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:49.990\nthat Wes's project is actually going so\nmuch better cuz he's not had no problems.\n\n354\n00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.380\nSo keep your focus right there.\n\n355\n00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.320\nWhen you do that, again,\n\n356\n00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:57.850\nyour quality does actually end up\nhelping you to get right back onto it.\n\n357\n00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:00.550\nYou also of course need to be\nable to measure that variance.\n\n358\n00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.960\nHow far are you off?\n\n359\n00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.050\nOf that original base line.\n\n360\n00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.040\nAnd this is gonna be true of whatever\nthing you're actually producing at this\n\n361\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.220\npoint okay?\n\n362\n00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:13.670\nAnd you may actually find out that you're\nnot really that far off in terms of cost\n\n363\n00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:18.920\ntime or even the scope that you're\nactually trying to produce.\n\n364\n00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.420\nAnd if you're not simple adjustments\nmight help you to be able to say,\n\n365\n00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.110\nI know exactly where\nthat came from here so\n\n366\n00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:30.960\nlet me see how far I have to move to get\nback onto that baseline that we need.\n\n367\n00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.160\nAnd then, of course,\nmonitoring that variance as well.\n\n368\n00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:39.210\nWhere in the world are these things\nhappening along my project plan?\n\n369\n00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.640\nWhen does it appear to be happen?\n\n370\n00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.510\nYou might find out something,\nthat this only happens,\n\n371\n00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:48.050\nlet's say in the morning or\nin the late afternoons.\n\n372\n00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:52.770\nOr when you only using a particular piece\nof machinery that you're getting stopped,\n\n373\n00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:55.140\nthat you're not expecting to get here.\n\n374\n00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:59.410\nAnd even as you figure out how the ends\nup happening from that point as well.\n\n375\n00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:02.650\nBeing able to identify\nwhere variances in depth,\n\n376\n00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:08.100\nattacking your project,\nnow allows you to implement some type of\n\n377\n00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:12.560\nchange that may help you out\nthen in fixing that too.\n\n378\n00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.270\nOkay?\n\n379\n00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:18.670\nSo making sure that we can identify those\nsimple variances will also help us out.\n\n380\n00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:22.580\nNow If you're now sitting there looking\nat this and you're hearing this.\n\n381\n00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.400\nLike, Ronnie I don't know how\nactually that actually controls me\n\n382\n00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.300\nmaking a project.\n\n383\n00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.170\nOkay, but\nremember that what we're talking about.\n\n384\n00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.530\nIs even though we can talk\nabout the quality assurance and\n\n385\n00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:34.110\nthe manufacturing that\nwe're really talking about.\n\n386\n00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.370\nAs far as a product that\nwe want to produce.\n\n387\n00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.330\nRemember that what we're\ntalking is how do we manage it?\n\n388\n00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.670\nSo, that's the whole thing\nin project management.\n\n389\n00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:46.330\nIt's not that we can do the quality\nassurance on the little thing that we need\n\n390\n00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.770\nto produce,\non the big thing that we need produce.\n\n391\n00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:52.530\nBut, we're not talking about, how do we\nmanage in making sure that all that stuff\n\n392\n00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:56.360\nis actually manageable when it\ncomes down to the entire project?\n\n393\n00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.710\nSo you're probably saying,\n\n394\n00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:00.120\nI don't know why measuring against\na baseline is a great thing.\n\n395\n00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.510\nBecause that's how you can actually\nget things back on track, right?\n\n396\n00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:06.360\nYou're actually saying, this is how\nI know I can assure the quality.\n\n397\n00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.340\nThis is your quality\nassurance that you can do.\n\n398\n00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:13.620\nYou're not the person that's actually\nthere carving whatever shape that is or\n\n399\n00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.210\nmaking sure it's actually not\nhitting some refraction rate that it\n\n400\n00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:17.070\ndoesn't need to hit.\n\n401\n00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.810\nYou're not trying to actually ensure that\nit actually last the 24 hours pressure\n\n402\n00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:21.960\ntest that needs to.\n\n403\n00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.770\nOkay?\n\n404\n00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.800\nYou tried to manage that to\nmake sure that it does end up\n\n405\n00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.910\nhappening the way that needs to happen.\n\n406\n00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:31.870\nThe way you do that is by keeping\neverything measure to get that\n\n407\n00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:33.020\nbaseline as well.\n\n408\n00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:33.790\nOkay.\n\n409\n00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:38.170\nAnd then of course if changes need to be\ndone here's four important steps here\n\n410\n00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.490\nIs that we end up finding\nout something here.\n\n411\n00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:45.110\nIs that,\nwe don't want people just making changes.\n\n412\n00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:48.790\nRemember that, when we have people\njust making changes because they go,\n\n413\n00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:50.330\nI know what this will do.\n\n414\n00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:53.410\nSome of the minor changes,\nyou allow those things to happen.\n\n415\n00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:57.610\nBut if this is a major change that needs\nto be done, it needs to be done according\n\n416\n00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:02.740\nto the formal process that will allow you\nto manage that process of change, right.\n\n417\n00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.850\nSo that means they need to go ahead and\nmake sure that they generate the proper\n\n418\n00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:10.320\nchange request which normally means\nmaking sure that you're using the proper\n\n419\n00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:14.860\ndocumentation and that they are following\nthat change management process.\n\n420\n00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:19.090\nIf they don't, and they implement changes\nalong the way without telling anybody\n\n421\n00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:22.050\nwell, you don't know where\nthe change was implemented.\n\n422\n00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.940\nYou don't know if there was something\nthat you could have changed even earlier\n\n423\n00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:25.800\nthan that.\n\n424\n00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.540\nOr did their change cause some\nother variance to happen as well?\n\n425\n00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.420\n>> You know, Ronnie,\nI've seen something like this.\n\n426\n00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:35.424\nMaybe not on a grand scale but in making\nmy lab environments where I'm setting up\n\n427\n00:23:35.424 --> 00:23:39.429\nfour servers and maybe I wasn't setting\nthe first server with my glasses on that\n\n428\n00:23:39.429 --> 00:23:43.296\nday so it's all messed up and I've got\nto get in there and I've got to fix it.\n\n429\n00:23:43.296 --> 00:23:46.560\nWell, I've make the mistake here and\nI'll raise my hand and\n\n430\n00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:51.040\nbe the one that's done this and I started\nchanging all these things without marking\n\n431\n00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.284\na single thing down and then it's fixed.\n\n432\n00:23:53.284 --> 00:23:54.406\nAnd then I couldn't tell\nyou how I fixed it.\n\n433\n00:23:54.406 --> 00:23:56.541\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So when I go to the next server,\n\n434\n00:23:56.541 --> 00:23:59.967\nI gotta start the process over again,\nit becomes very cyclic process.\n\n435\n00:23:59.967 --> 00:24:02.463\nAnd then ultimately it's\nadding more work and\n\n436\n00:24:02.463 --> 00:24:06.830\nI'm getting farther behind cuz I didn't\nfollow that systematic approach.\n\n437\n00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:09.011\n>> There's no doubt that this\nis why it's very important.\n\n438\n00:24:09.011 --> 00:24:13.790\nAnd what Wes told you is him working\nas an individual on that one thing.\n\n439\n00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:17.390\nWell now imagine that you're having\nto actually do this entire thing, but\n\n440\n00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.700\nyou're now managing 50 people, okay?\n\n441\n00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:24.770\nAnd those 50 people, when you say\njust make the changes as you need to,\n\n442\n00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:28.390\nand now something does change\non your project, right?\n\n443\n00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:33.280\nAnd that happens, well which of those 50\npeople are you gonna actually say hey,\n\n444\n00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.300\nwho made this change that caused this?\n\n445\n00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:39.480\nWell, all of them will do the same thing\nthat Wes said is, it could have been me.\n\n446\n00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.802\nThere's a very possibility\nthat it could have been me.\n\n447\n00:24:41.802 --> 00:24:45.498\nBut because 49 other people\nhad made changes that day,\n\n448\n00:24:45.498 --> 00:24:49.600\nhow do we actually know which\none improved the process?\n\n449\n00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:54.610\nOr what particular change ended up getting\nmade that actually hindered the process of\n\n450\n00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.910\nme developing the quality of\nproduct that I needed to?\n\n451\n00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:01.180\nYou really don't know unless\npeople are willing to follow this.\n\n452\n00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:05.720\nSo part of that process in managing the\noverall quality assurance of your project\n\n453\n00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.500\nis to ensure that this happens right here.\n\n454\n00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:11.170\nMaking sure that they are generating\nthe proper change request that\n\n455\n00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:12.310\nneeds to be done.\n\n456\n00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:13.540\nOur final step right there,\n\n457\n00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:18.110\nright, is then what we call the idea of\nimplementing the change request itself.\n\n458\n00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:20.690\nAfter everything's approved in\nthe way that we want to, we end\n\n459\n00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:24.820\nup working with those major stakeholders\nor the team members, right, that\n\n460\n00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:29.200\nwill actually allow us to get the change\nimplemented in the way that we need to.\n\n461\n00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.370\nNow, we're gonna talk a little bit more\nabout that in another episode as well when\n\n462\n00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:39.190\nwe talk about the idea of quality\ncontrol changes that need to be managed.\n\n463\n00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:41.576\nBut at this particular point\nthat's what we're talking about.\n\n464\n00:25:41.576 --> 00:25:45.637\nIs that at this point here, we now\nactually implement that quality control,\n\n465\n00:25:45.637 --> 00:25:48.760\nwhether it's a reparative action or\na corrective action or\n\n466\n00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.697\nsome type of preventative\naction that needs to be done,\n\n467\n00:25:51.697 --> 00:25:55.214\nto ensure that the quality does\nexists in the way that we want it to.\n\n468\n00:25:55.214 --> 00:26:00.500\nSo, quality assurance is a big part of\nyour project if you're a project manager.\n\n469\n00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:05.370\nAnd you making sure that the overall\nmanagement of your project has\n\n470\n00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:08.900\nthe high quality that you want\nto have is actually up to\n\n471\n00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.070\nyou to use the resources that\nare actually available to you.\n\n472\n00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:13.890\nFollow the quality assurance steps and\n\n473\n00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:17.090\nthat will help you out more\nthan you'll ever realize.\n\n474\n00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:19.440\nEven though it seems like basic facts and\n\n475\n00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.460\nbasic things that need to be done,\nthey're very important.\n\n476\n00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:27.030\nBecause anything that you\ncannot manage on your project\n\n477\n00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:31.130\nmeans you don't know about it, which means\nit's outside of your particular control.\n\n478\n00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:34.930\nSo that means your equality is not\ndefinitely by your control either.\n\n479\n00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:36.970\nSo that's why this is very important.\n\n480\n00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:38.080\n>> Great information, Ronnie.\n\n481\n00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.539\nKeep in mind that we've looked at five\nmajor principles in this episode.\n\n482\n00:26:41.539 --> 00:26:43.303\nRemember, we've looked at monitoring,\n\n483\n00:26:43.303 --> 00:26:46.496\nmonitoring's broken down into a couple\nlittle categories in and of itself.\n\n484\n00:26:46.496 --> 00:26:49.412\nWe've got to set a baseline, then we've\ngot to find out what reality is, right,\n\n485\n00:26:49.412 --> 00:26:51.885\nwhat's actually happening\ncompared back to the baseline.\n\n486\n00:26:51.885 --> 00:26:56.798\nRemember we have to identify, right, or\nanalyze, right, now we've got the data,\n\n487\n00:26:56.798 --> 00:26:58.177\nwhat are we looking at?\n\n488\n00:26:58.177 --> 00:27:00.980\nSo we go back and\nanalyze that information,\n\n489\n00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:04.028\nwe identify where things\ndo need to be changed.\n\n490\n00:27:04.028 --> 00:27:08.402\nAnd those last two steps, they're very\nimportant, the changes themselves.\n\n491\n00:27:08.402 --> 00:27:12.320\nA formalized process to make\na change starts with a request.\n\n492\n00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.990\nAnd then finally, the implementation.\n\n493\n00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:16.020\nRonnie, great information.\n\n494\n00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.840\nDo you have anything else for this one?\n\n495\n00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.370\n>> Well, not so much for this one.\n\n496\n00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:22.330\nBut just remember that we\nknow that we went through\n\n497\n00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:26.230\na couple of those different\nformulas that seem a bit confusing.\n\n498\n00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:27.710\nRemember that I said it during there, and\n\n499\n00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:31.680\nI'll say it again, that this will not\nbe the last time you'll see that.\n\n500\n00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.410\nAnd yes, you will need to prepare for\nthat when you're getting ready for\n\n501\n00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:35.760\nyour Project+ exam.\n\n502\n00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:39.530\nBut the good thing is we do have episodes\ncoming up that will help to ensure that\n\n503\n00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:43.700\nyou understand those particular formulas\nmuch better than what we went over here.\n\n504\n00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.840\nSo don't be disheartened at this\npoint if you've just watched a 30\n\n505\n00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.360\nminute episode and\n\n506\n00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:52.250\nyou're saying, hey, you really didn't give\nus a chance to go over those formulas.\n\n507\n00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:55.650\nWe're gonna go over them in\ncomplete depth, I guarantee you.\n\n508\n00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:58.320\nAnd you'll be able to\ntake those apart then.\n\n509\n00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.700\n>> Thank you very much for that, Ronnie.\n\n510\n00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:04.790\nWell, keep in mind we've got more exciting\nepisodes here in Project+ to come,\n\n511\n00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:05.585\nif I can say that.\n\n512\n00:28:05.585 --> 00:28:06.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n513\n00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.570\nwe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off here at ITProTV.\n\n514\n00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.080\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n515\n00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.060\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n516\n00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.240\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n517\n00:28:13.240 -->

00:00:16.786\nI'm your host, Wes Bryan, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.786 --> 00:00:20.160\nin this episode we're gonna be\ncontinuing along in Project+.\n\n5\n00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.569\nAnd I've got none other than Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:24.296\nRonnie Wong here with us to help us out,\nRonnie, how you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:24.296 --> 00:00:25.640\n>> All right, I'm doing well.\n\n8\n00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.010\nAs we continue on here, we're taking\na look at CompTIA's Project+ and\n\n9\n00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.030\nin this episode, we're moving along and\nwe're taking a look at,\n\n10\n00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.430\nhow do we actually use our data to\nhelp us in terms of quality control?\n\n11\n00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.820\nNow, we've just really done an episode or\nso, previous episode on the idea of\n\n12\n00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.730\nactually using quality assurance,\nmaking sure that everything in our\n\n13\n00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.760\nproject plan is actually ready for us to\ndeliver the quality product that we need.\n\n14\n00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.560\nNow, we're talking about\nthe idea of quality control,\n\n15\n00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.650\nremember that quality assurance is more\nof a preventative type of issue for us.\n\n16\n00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.850\nAnd we wanna make sure\nthat everything we can do,\n\n17\n00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.187\nthat we're preventing defects from\nactually getting into our product.\n\n18\n00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:05.630\nBut at the same time,\nwhen we talk about quality control, we're\n\n19\n00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.327\nactually preventing, essentially, any type\nof quality defect or anything that we want\n\n20\n00:01:10.327 --> 00:01:15.100\nto call that we don't accept from actually\ngetting out of our control, as well.\n\n21\n00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.170\nSo quality control is about correction,\n\n22\n00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.490\nmore than anything else\nthat we actually have.\n\n23\n00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.600\nAnd how do we actually know what\nactually needs correcting and\n\n24\n00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.270\nhow do we actually see the way that our\nparticular project is performing or\n\n25\n00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.580\na particular product is actually doing\nwhen we are actually looking at it?\n\n26\n00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.610\nAnd are we actually gonna\nget good quality out of it?\n\n27\n00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.030\nSo we're gonna take a look especially here\nat some of the tools that you and I gonna\n\n28\n00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.300\nuse as a project manager to essentially\nhelp us in correcting for quality.\n\n29\n00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.930\nThat's where we are actually taking a look\nat here in terms of control, and so\n\n30\n00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.940\nwhen it begins, it begins with actual\ndata, and that is the key for us.\n\n31\n00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.410\nWe don't have to stand there,\neven though you can if you choose to, and\n\n32\n00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.490\nwatch for\neverything that comes off the line.\n\n33\n00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.860\nSo if you are producing some product in\nyour project, whatever it might be, let's\n\n34\n00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.380\nsay a manufacturing process in terms of\nblue jeans or whatever it might be here.\n\n35\n00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.020\nIf you're actually producing that, you can\nsit there and watch the run go all the way\n\n36\n00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.040\nthrough for every single pair of blue\njeans produced off your new process line\n\n37\n00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.140\nand go through, and that way you know\nthat you're actually monitoring for it.\n\n38\n00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.380\nAnd anything that doesn't look\ngood to you, at that point,\n\n39\n00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.314\nyou can go, I don't like that one and\njust toss it out.\n\n40\n00:02:29.314 --> 00:02:32.693\nThat's your quality control\nif you chose to do that.\n\n41\n00:02:32.693 --> 00:02:36.241\nBut that type of work is actually so\ntime-consuming at that point,\n\n42\n00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:38.370\nyou just don't have the time to do that.\n\n43\n00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.860\nIf you were to actually inspect\nevery single piece by itself and\n\n44\n00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.480\nmake sure it's verified for it's quality,\n\n45\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.480\nit would take you forever before it's\neven sold a single pair of blue jeans.\n\n46\n00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.415\nSo instead, what we normally do is\nthat we have something that we can do,\n\n47\n00:02:52.415 --> 00:02:57.030\nwe can take data that is actually\ngenerated from the actual results that we\n\n48\n00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.130\nhave in terms of performance, and be able\nto take a look and analyze that data.\n\n49\n00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.680\nAnd then, help us to focus in on\nthe things that we need to focus in on, so\n\n50\n00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.770\nthat we can correct the defects\nthat are actually there.\n\n51\n00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.480\nSo one of the things that we can do is\nwe can take the data that we're given,\n\n52\n00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.830\nand start actually charting\nthe data a little bit.\n\n53\n00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.770\nAnd that will help us to focus in.\n\n54\n00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.010\nLet me show you an example of what\nI'm talking about right here.\n\n55\n00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.186\nSo when we take a look at something,\n\n56\n00:03:24.186 --> 00:03:27.466\nlet's see if I can zoom in\njust a little bit more here.\n\n57\n00:03:27.466 --> 00:03:30.183\nAnd that way we'll be able\nto pick it up a little bit.\n\n58\n00:03:30.183 --> 00:03:33.696\nSo there's something that we can do that\nwe call the Pareto Analysis here, or\n\n59\n00:03:33.696 --> 00:03:35.540\nthe Pareto Charting.\n\n60\n00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.020\nNow, in terms of Pareto,\nif you've heard this term before or\n\n61\n00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.230\nit sounds vaguely familiar,\n\n62\n00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.370\nhere is the general business rule that\nmost people use in business management.\n\n63\n00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.060\nIs that there's what's called the 80-20\nprinciple, or the 20-80 principle, or\n\n64\n00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.360\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n65\n00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.300\nWhen you're actually trying to manage your\nworkforce, trying to to encourage them,\n\n66\n00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.080\nwhat you end up realizing is\nsomething that's always on your side,\n\n67\n00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.390\nthat's why you can encourage everybody.\n\n68\n00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.300\nIs the idea of the Pareto principle.\n\n69\n00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.980\nThe Pareto principle pretty\nmuch says this for you.\n\n70\n00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.440\nIs that only really 20% of your\nworkforce generates essentially 80% of\n\n71\n00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.265\nthe work that's actually\ndone in your company.\n\n72\n00:04:12.265 --> 00:04:15.510\nSo even though you have\na gigantic workforce, really,\n\n73\n00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.792\nthe majority of the work, or\nwhat's actually super productive for you,\n\n74\n00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:21.808\nit's really only done by 20%.\n\n75\n00:04:21.808 --> 00:04:25.970\nSo when you actually think about it, that\nmeans the other 80%, it's not that they're\n\n76\n00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.505\nnot doing work, but it's just not as\nproductive as those other 20% are.\n\n77\n00:04:29.505 --> 00:04:33.463\nAnd the reason why that's actually\nimportant is, as you go back now to\n\n78\n00:04:33.463 --> 00:04:38.180\nthe idea of quality control, let's take\na look right here, and keep that in mind.\n\n79\n00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.000\nSo when we talk about the Pareto\nprinciple at this particular point.\n\n80\n00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.140\nNotice over here on the left-hand side,\nI have a list of reported causes here.\n\n81\n00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.093\nAnd what we've actually done at some\npoint is that we run a line here and\n\n82\n00:04:50.093 --> 00:04:51.375\nwe run it for so often.\n\n83\n00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:56.190\nAnd let's say it's 10,000 runs.\n\n84\n00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.090\nLet's say it's 10,000 pairs of\nblue jeans that we have produced.\n\n85\n00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.000\nBut now in terms of quality,\nwhen we took a look at them,\n\n86\n00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.590\nwe actually found out something,\nthat we have the wrong indigo tint.\n\n87\n00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.340\nSo however it is, if you're like Wes and\n\n88\n00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.560\nyou like that stone washed look,\nthat's a particular tint.\n\n89\n00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.470\nIf you like the solid dark blue color,\nthat's another one.\n\n90\n00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.000\nBut let's say that we realize that for\nour brand,\n\n91\n00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.550\nwe had 85 pairs that came out of that\nparticular run and it was the wrong tint.\n\n92\n00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.510\nAnother one, 43 pairs here actually had\nsome loose stitching that allowed some\n\n93\n00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.720\nof the seams to actually look bad or\nactually even unravel a little bit.\n\n94\n00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.320\nThat would be pretty bad, as well.\n\n95\n00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.640\nCrooked Back Pockets whatever\nmight happen here how is\n\n96\n00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.340\nactually situated let's say that somewhere\nalong the process we had about 35 of them,\n\n97\n00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.440\n35 pairs that had Crooked Back Pockets.\n\n98\n00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.610\nMissing Brand Tag that's a really big one,\nyou'd hate actually sale your product and\n\n99\n00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.420\nyour brand not actually appear on\nyou products so there's another one.\n\n100\n00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.292\nZipper for one reason or another got\nsewed on backwards that would be bad.\n\n101\n00:06:00.292 --> 00:06:03.140\nNow, for anybody [LAUGH] to actually\n\n102\n00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.790\nhave to unzip from the inside\nof the actual blue jeans there.\n\n103\n00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.642\nMissing belt loops another 5.\n\n104\n00:06:08.642 --> 00:06:12.587\nSo let's say that when we actually took\na look at our overall total number\n\n105\n00:06:12.587 --> 00:06:16.479\nof defects out of that run of\n10,000 pairs, defects right here.\n\n106\n00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:21.424\nAbout 208 of those actually\nended up defective in some way.\n\n107\n00:06:21.424 --> 00:06:24.574\nNow, you can take that percentage and\nbreak it all down and kinda realize,\n\n108\n00:06:24.574 --> 00:06:26.579\nwell, that means 1,000 would be 10%.\n\n109\n00:06:26.579 --> 00:06:28.983\nAnd then, you continue to break\nthat down and figure it out.\n\n110\n00:06:28.983 --> 00:06:32.490\nAnd go, this is not a bad run, overall.\n\n111\n00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.330\nBut what are you trying to do?\n\n112\n00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.384\nIn quality control you have to\nactually figure out something.\n\n113\n00:06:37.384 --> 00:06:41.030\nI have all these defects but I'd like\nto repair every single one of them.\n\n114\n00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.450\nYou better believe it.\n\n115\n00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.070\nI want to make sure that none\nof this ends up happening.\n\n116\n00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.080\nSo where do you spend the majority\nof your time and try and\n\n117\n00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.510\nactually figure out what's also going on.\n\n118\n00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.870\nWell, if you need that line back up and\nrunning and make sure that the quality's\n\n119\n00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.540\nbetter, you go to figure out where you're\ngonna actually spend the majority of your\n\n120\n00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.320\ntime, where you're gonna put\nthe majority of your money to do so.\n\n121\n00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.460\nSo the Pareto Analysis\nhelps us to do that.\n\n122\n00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.090\nWe essentially charted\nusing a bar chart here.\n\n123\n00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.220\nAnd these are approximations\nhere is what I did.\n\n124\n00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:15.039\nSo here is 85, here is 43,\n35, 24, 16, and 5.\n\n125\n00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:19.320\nIf you wanna do it exact, you can actually\ntake some spreadsheet program that does\n\n126\n00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.090\ncharting for you and\ndo the exact same thing.\n\n127\n00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.850\nI did it in this diagram in a little\nbit more hefty doing it manually.\n\n128\n00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:30.210\nAnd especially in this particular\nsoftware, but you can do it.\n\n129\n00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.520\nThen, once you actually determine that,\nso those are actually representing,\n\n130\n00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.680\nthe bars are representing the total\nnumber of defects is what we have.\n\n131\n00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.440\nNow, what we want to do is, we want\nto actually break it down by what is\n\n132\n00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.170\nthe percentage that each one of those\nrepresents of a 100% of my defects.\n\n133\n00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.315\nSo the way that you end up doing that is\nyou know where the total is, which is 208.\n\n134\n00:07:52.315 --> 00:07:58.913\nYou actually say 85 and you divide it by\n208 and that will give you around 43%.\n\n135\n00:07:58.913 --> 00:08:03.891\nOkay, so this particular bar right\nhere represents about 43% of your\n\n136\n00:08:03.891 --> 00:08:06.460\nparticular defects, okay.\n\n137\n00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.900\nThen you can do the same thing\nwith the loose stitching as well.\n\n138\n00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.160\nDo the same thing, and\nthen you chart it this way.\n\n139\n00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.510\nSo notice that each of these little\nred dots that are actually right here,\n\n140\n00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.450\nsee if I can zoom in a little bit more.\n\n141\n00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.890\nEach of these red dots actually\nrepresent another percentage up.\n\n142\n00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.600\nRight, so you actually add in that.\n\n143\n00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.720\nThat 23 would represent another 20%.\n\n144\n00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.190\nAnd so,\nyou actually go up from that point.\n\n145\n00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.200\nAnd I'm now up here about 63 or 64%.\n\n146\n00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.700\nAnd then you continue to go down and\nyou do that.\n\n147\n00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.120\nAnd you actually see this adding\nin another 10 or 15% here.\n\n148\n00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.708\nWhatever that might be, and\nhere's another 3 or 5%.\n\n149\n00:08:40.708 --> 00:08:46.570\nHere's another 2% and ultimately that\nleads me up to 100% here of my defects.\n\n150\n00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.900\nNow you're probably wondering, what the\nheck does this really show you overall,\n\n151\n00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.730\nand why is this actually important?\n\n152\n00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.530\nIt's important because of\nthe Pareto Principle, right?\n\n153\n00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.450\nSo in that Pareto Principle,\n\n154\n00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:02.640\nin that idea we can now take chart\ninformation like this and figure out\n\n155\n00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.870\nwhere do I need to spend the majority\nof my time in fixing the defects, okay.\n\n156\n00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.517\nWell notice that I have\n80% of the defects here.\n\n157\n00:09:10.517 --> 00:09:14.163\nSo here is the 80% rule, right here.\n\n158\n00:09:14.163 --> 00:09:21.639\nSo let's say we draw a line right there,\nright across that at 80%.\n\n159\n00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:24.570\nSo there's 80% of my defects.\n\n160\n00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:29.265\nThen you also can draw an intersecting\nline right where this red\n\n161\n00:09:29.265 --> 00:09:33.073\nline kind of comes in,\nand I'll try and be, oops,\n\n162\n00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:37.343\nlet me see if I can draw a line and\nnot just a blank box here.\n\n163\n00:09:37.343 --> 00:09:41.405\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me try that again.\n\n164\n00:09:41.405 --> 00:09:46.330\nA line, you think that I'm trying to\ndraw the Mona Lisa or something less.\n\n165\n00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:47.860\nBut there it is, okay.\n\n166\n00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.240\nSo there is a line at\nthe intersecting point here, okay.\n\n167\n00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.710\nNow why is that actually important?\n\n168\n00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.090\nIt shows you at least to the left in line\n\n169\n00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:02.290\nhere's where you should spend the majority\nof your time fixing the defects, right?\n\n170\n00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:07.510\nThis actually does represent the 80%\nof all of our defects right about here\n\n171\n00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:11.600\nis in the wrong tinting and\nalso the loose stitching altogether.\n\n172\n00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.000\nOkay, so when you add all that up,\nthat's what ends up happening.\n\n173\n00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.180\nNow can you go all the way\nto the back pocket?\n\n174\n00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.590\nYes, you can.\n\n175\n00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.380\nBut notice that we only really have two\nevents that's actually reporting defects.\n\n176\n00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.900\nSo now if you're actually\ninside of a project and\n\n177\n00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.360\nyou need to correct the majority\nof defects as fast as possible.\n\n178\n00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:33.730\nThese are the two processes inside of\nyour project that you had spent the time\n\n179\n00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.290\nworking on more than anything else.\n\n180\n00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:36.530\nWell, what about these other ones?\n\n181\n00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:37.140\nCan you work on them?\n\n182\n00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.830\nYes, but as far as fixing\nthe majority of the defects go, yes,\n\n183\n00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.350\nyou wanna make sure that you spend\nyour time and your effort and\n\n184\n00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:49.240\nyour energy here in terms of quality,\nmaking sure that these are done.\n\n185\n00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.532\nAnd then whatever is left over,\nyou spend time fixing that.\n\n186\n00:10:53.532 --> 00:10:57.450\nThat's really important in terms of\nquality management as a project manager.\n\n187\n00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:03.270\nBecause do I actually spend more time in\ntrying to figure out why I'm having belt\n\n188\n00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:09.100\nloop issues, when I actually under-the-gun\nin terms of the project itself for\n\n189\n00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:14.390\nthe time and the money and the scope\nof my particular project process.\n\n190\n00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:18.760\nOr do I spend the majority of my\ntime on the 80% of the defects?\n\n191\n00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.920\nVery important that you understand\nthat in terms of quality control\n\n192\n00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.100\nbecause that's what's actually gonna\nhelp you to ensure that your product is\n\n193\n00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.960\nactually gonna continue to get\nout there and that the majority,\n\n194\n00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.960\nif not all of your defects\ncan be fixed along the way.\n\n195\n00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.300\nBut this is where you absolutely know\nthat something is going wrong 80%\n\n196\n00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.120\nof the time right there.\n\n197\n00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.310\n>> When using this chart Ronnie,\nit's interesting, I would've maybe without\n\n198\n00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.110\nthe chart by any means, I would've just\nsat there and said, you know what?\n\n199\n00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:46.296\nIf we can get a whole bunch of small\nthings done, we're knocking off,\n\n200\n00:11:46.296 --> 00:11:47.320\nwell now we've got-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n201\n00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.300\n>> In the case of the graph,\nlet's use an example.\n\n202\n00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.620\nWe've got four defects that we fixed,\nbut according to this graph\n\n203\n00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.690\nfrom the magenta over to the right there,\nyou might have those four things fixed,\n\n204\n00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:00.060\nbut you didn't even come close to\nsolving a good majority of the issues.\n\n205\n00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.300\n>> Yeah, you actually only solved\nabout 20% of those issues and\n\n206\n00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.720\nthose things might actually\nbe solved very simply but\n\n207\n00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.880\nremember that if you wanna spend time and\neffort actually ensuring better quality.\n\n208\n00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.590\nSpending your time where the 80% is\nactually gonna go is the way to go as\n\n209\n00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:15.460\nwell, okay?\n\n210\n00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.780\nSo you're gonna see that that is really\nabout 20% of the work of what we have.\n\n211\n00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.570\nSo if we have those six,\nwe're only doing about a third of them.\n\n212\n00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.360\nSo you can kind of see that as well.\n\n213\n00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.240\nSo it's just kind of\na neat thing you can do.\n\n214\n00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.240\nThe more that you actually\nget into project management,\n\n215\n00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.620\nthe more that the Pareto type of\nanalysis really can at least help you or\n\n216\n00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:38.220\nhelp your teammates focus in on\nwhat actually needs to be done.\n\n217\n00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:42.260\nAnd that's where you actually get good\nquality control from as well, okay?\n\n218\n00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.790\nSo that's a great way for\nus to think about it.\n\n219\n00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:49.140\nNow, the other thing that they also call\nout especially on the exam objectives\n\n220\n00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.060\nhere, I'm making sure\nthat you also understand.\n\n221\n00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.170\nIs gonna be what they call a histogram.\n\n222\n00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.980\nBelieve it or not, the Pareto analysis or\n\n223\n00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:58.230\nthe Pareto charting is\na form of a histogram.\n\n224\n00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.480\nWhen we talk about histograms, what we're\nactually saying is that we're actually\n\n225\n00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.400\ngiving you data and\nwe're showing it to you on a bar chart.\n\n226\n00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.240\nAnd normally it's the same way that\nwe actually took a look at here.\n\n227\n00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.240\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at another one.\n\n228\n00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.860\nSo here's the same thing,\nhere's another Pareto Analysis here.\n\n229\n00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.740\nThis one's based on\nProduct Delivery Failures instead.\n\n230\n00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.890\nSo here's a process in which we have our\ndelivery service, and we're finding out\n\n231\n00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:23.120\nsomething, that there are of course\n40 that didn't have any signatures,\n\n232\n00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.580\nthat's why we couldn't deliver them.\n\n233\n00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.415\nSome of them have missing addresses,\nsome of them have wrong addresses,\n\n234\n00:13:27.415 --> 00:13:31.100\nwrong delivered package,\nrejected packages, whatever it might be.\n\n235\n00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.490\nSo even when we have something like this,\nright?\n\n236\n00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:37.140\nNotice that the information is actually\npresented as far as the data goes in terms\n\n237\n00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.430\nof a bar.\n\n238\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:42.160\nAnd this particular bar chart has\nnormally two different elements to it.\n\n239\n00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.280\nAnd so, that's what you're also\nlooking at in terms of the histogram.\n\n240\n00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.090\nOkay, now ours here happens to be a number\nof defects versus the percentage of\n\n241\n00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:50.020\ndefects.\n\n242\n00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:54.080\nBut you can do this, the number of\ndefects over time if you wanted to or\n\n243\n00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.360\nover a particular product line,\nwhatever it might be.\n\n244\n00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.260\nAnd that way you can actually\nmeasure it in that way.\n\n245\n00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.050\nSo if you do have multiple variables,\nokay.\n\n246\n00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.770\nOr at least two variables and\nyou also wanna do it to a bar charts so\n\n247\n00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:07.470\nthat you can graph the data and\n\n248\n00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.160\nfigure out where you're actually\nseeing the majority of those defects.\n\n249\n00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.800\nYou're actually gonna use\nsomething like this as well.\n\n250\n00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:18.880\nI just used a Pareto, again, just to show\nyou another example of a histogram too.\n\n251\n00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.480\nSo this is something that, again,\nis something that you can look at and\n\n252\n00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.780\nI recommend actually using something\nlike Excel to help you out,\n\n253\n00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.110\nif you're gonna do this.\n\n254\n00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.260\nThe reason why,\nis you're not having to guess an estimate.\n\n255\n00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.460\nThe good thing is once you actually know\nhow you can enter your data into what\n\n256\n00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:37.740\nyou're charting, you simply just go to\nExcel and you tell it, just create a chart\n\n257\n00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.440\nfor me based off my data and\nit'll automatically generate it for you.\n\n258\n00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.570\nA lot of times, even guessing that\nyou want a bar chart to do this,\n\n259\n00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:47.680\nif you're actually measuring\nsome type of data there, okay.\n\n260\n00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:52.320\nSo, that idea of actually using\nthe histogram is a big one that we can\n\n261\n00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.000\nactually use.\n\n262\n00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.540\nAnd it doesn't have to be like this.\n\n263\n00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.390\nI just made it the same one so\n\n264\n00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:02.060\nthat you could see it's an example of one\nthat we also have right there too, okay?\n\n265\n00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.480\nSo that can help you out in terms of\nyour quality control as well, okay.\n\n266\n00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.290\nTo see what particular things\nare actually going wrong.\n\n267\n00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.630\nAnd, it is actually doing an overtime or\nover a particular machine,\n\n268\n00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.990\nwhatever it might be,\nyou can see that too.\n\n269\n00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:20.950\nNow, one of the other ones that it calls\nout is what is called a Run Chart.\n\n270\n00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:24.100\nAnd so, here's one that actually\ndoes happen, and actually,\n\n271\n00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.339\nthis is one of my computer\nmore than anything else.\n\n272\n00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:33.080\nSo let's say that on your project, you're\nactually using a particular machine, okay.\n\n273\n00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.230\nSo for example, like our show,\nwe actually are recording this on what\n\n274\n00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:41.200\nwe call a Grass Valley Director,\nis what we have right?\n\n275\n00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:46.380\nSo that machine can actually get high and\nget low as far as the temperatures go.\n\n276\n00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:50.480\nAnd what you might actually want to do is\nactually figure out when you have issues,\n\n277\n00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.540\nhow long has that machine been up?\n\n278\n00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.432\nHow long has it been running?\n\n279\n00:15:53.432 --> 00:15:55.694\nWhat are the actual temperature\nissues that we have?\n\n280\n00:15:55.694 --> 00:15:58.644\nNow this one's actually on my\ncomputer because my computer\n\n281\n00:15:58.644 --> 00:16:00.416\nactually acts strangely at times.\n\n282\n00:16:00.416 --> 00:16:06.270\nWhere even on the show you can actually\nhear the fan ramp up to like 6200 RPMs.\n\n283\n00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:11.700\nAnd it just sounds like a rushing,\na wind that's actually blowing by here.\n\n284\n00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.430\nSo I have a little monitor that\nI have up here, I don't know,\n\n285\n00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.480\nyou can't probably see\nthat little tab here.\n\n286\n00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.710\nBut it says right now is 105\ndegrees 0.8 that's running at 1200,\n\n287\n00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:25.650\n1300 rpms, okay, right now.\n\n288\n00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:31.520\nNow, before the show, I essentially went\nahead and I made this run chart here.\n\n289\n00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.330\nI have a scale here based on 32 degrees,\n\n290\n00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.820\nI just kind of estimated\nit on whatever I wanted to.\n\n291\n00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.660\nAnd then, Ashley said,\nI'm going to measure this, let's say,\n\n292\n00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:41.810\nat five minute intervals.\n\n293\n00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:45.090\nNow, I realize that sometimes it wasn't\nexactly five, but I thought that I would\n\n294\n00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:49.840\ndo this in my regular working of\nwhat I do right before the show.\n\n295\n00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:55.460\nSo, what I did here is I started\nmeasuring when I wanted to and\n\n296\n00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:59.280\nso five minutes after I started\nmeasuring here, I took a measurement and\n\n297\n00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:02.570\nit was like 98 degrees right then, okay?\n\n298\n00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.715\nThen about five minutes more,\nwhen I started using it and\n\n299\n00:17:05.715 --> 00:17:08.797\nstarted checking email,\nstarted doing other things,\n\n300\n00:17:08.797 --> 00:17:12.742\nI realized something it actually\nwent up to about 120 degrees or so.\n\n301\n00:17:12.742 --> 00:17:15.840\nAnd maybe a little bit less than that,\nokay.\n\n302\n00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.830\nAnd then I turn on the virtual machine,\nokay, for a few minutes.\n\n303\n00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:23.540\nAnd I realized it kicked up to about 160\ndegrees as long as I have that virtual\n\n304\n00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.480\nmachine running.\n\n305\n00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.400\nFans ramped up,\nit did everything that it needed to.\n\n306\n00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.380\nAnd then when I turn\nthat virtual machine off,\n\n307\n00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.750\nI could see the temperature start\nto drop and it drop back down here.\n\n308\n00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:36.290\nAnd it continued on, and\nI did that for about 30 minutes, okay.\n\n309\n00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:41.650\nSo that gives me kind of a nice\nrun time over a period of time\n\n310\n00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:45.790\nthat I can track the operational\ntemperature of my computer.\n\n311\n00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:50.730\nNow I drew this line right here because\nit tended to hover right around there.\n\n312\n00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:54.841\nAnd that actually lets you know, maybe my\ncomputer looks like it actually operates\n\n313\n00:17:54.841 --> 00:17:56.732\nright around that particular point.\n\n314\n00:17:56.732 --> 00:17:59.144\nNow I why did I choose the 128 one?\n\n315\n00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:04.120\nNotice a lot of them really did hover\nright below or right around that mark.\n\n316\n00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.068\nAnd so I use that as my guide,\nand I drew a line here and\n\n317\n00:18:07.068 --> 00:18:09.424\nI marked it at the intervals\nis what I did.\n\n318\n00:18:09.424 --> 00:18:13.520\nSo if I have temperatures that are right\naround here, the majority of them,\n\n319\n00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.600\nI know prior that my computer is\noperating where it needs to be.\n\n320\n00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.790\nBut if mine actually continued\nto stay up here above that,\n\n321\n00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.550\nit might be where I actually\nhave to look at it.\n\n322\n00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.990\nCuz I don't know if that's\nactually safe temperatures or not.\n\n323\n00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:29.900\nBut when I did ramp it up, it actually did\nkind of do everything that it needed to.\n\n324\n00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.640\nBut it calmed right back down and\nI was able to see that.\n\n325\n00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.800\nThat again is about quality control.\n\n326\n00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.160\nImagine that for\nwhatever you're doing right?\n\n327\n00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.390\nYou need to actually understand what those\noperational temperatures are going to be\n\n328\n00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.680\nand see if your machine's actually\noutside of those controls or\n\n329\n00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.160\nnot, if they're actually within range or\nperfectly fine.\n\n330\n00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.920\nMost time runtime doesn't\ntend to limit you, but\n\n331\n00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.300\nat least show you what the actual\nhas historical value is, and\n\n332\n00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:58.310\nthen when you compare it against you\nknow your upper limits and lower limits,\n\n333\n00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:01.680\nthen that way you actually have\na nice comparison that you can do.\n\n334\n00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.179\nYou do this for about a week, yes, you do\nget kind of a real average of how your\n\n335\n00:19:05.179 --> 00:19:07.315\ncomputer is actually gonna end up working,\nor\n\n336\n00:19:07.315 --> 00:19:09.973\nwhatever it is product that\nyou're using is gonna work.\n\n337\n00:19:09.973 --> 00:19:14.396\nAnd that way you actually know that hey\nwhen one week everything up here is about\n\n338\n00:19:14.396 --> 00:19:15.850\n192 degrees.\n\n339\n00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:18.505\nYou kinda know that it's actually\nnot inside of your quality range,\n\n340\n00:19:18.505 --> 00:19:20.030\nyou might start experiencing issues.\n\n341\n00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:21.615\n>> And then what's interesting here,\nRonnie,\n\n342\n00:19:21.615 --> 00:19:23.533\nis that it looks like you\nhave a constellation, right?\n\n343\n00:19:23.533 --> 00:19:26.709\n>> Yup. [LAUGH] >> It was a constellation,\nbut it is marking a pattern, right?\n\n344\n00:19:26.709 --> 00:19:29.450\nSo this is really good that\nyou can see that there's\n\n345\n00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:32.578\nidentified patterns inside of\ncertain specific times and\n\n346\n00:19:32.578 --> 00:19:37.001\nrelated those patterns to what was going\non on the machine during that time frame.\n\n347\n00:19:37.001 --> 00:19:38.610\n>> Yeah, and that's the key, right?\n\n348\n00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:42.670\nIf you want good quality and let's say\nyour quality you kinda realize something.\n\n349\n00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.820\nIs that everything works perfectly as\nlong as it's actually within here,\n\n350\n00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.600\nyour machine tends to\nexperience heavy loads up here.\n\n351\n00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.940\nThen you kinda realize that you may\nactually have to do is a little bit\n\n352\n00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.240\nsomething else to ensure that you get the\ncooling that you need for your machine.\n\n353\n00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.000\nAnd this can be done if you're actually\nexperience defects when things are warmer,\n\n354\n00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.410\nyou're actually experiencing slow down,\nwhen things are too cool,\n\n355\n00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:02.510\nwhatever it might be.\n\n356\n00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:06.240\nIt allows you to see the actual real\nrun time and be able to chart it.\n\n357\n00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.040\nAnd that way, you can actually\nspot trends that may happen.\n\n358\n00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:15.790\nYou know that, let's say for example,\non workloads on servers, right, that you\n\n359\n00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:20.370\nmight find out that the workload is very\nheavy right about 9:05 in the morning.\n\n360\n00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:21.400\nWhy is that?\n\n361\n00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.500\nWell, people are logging into\nthe machines all about the same time,\n\n362\n00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:28.120\nthey're checking their email and they've\nactually started opening their programs,\n\n363\n00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:32.290\nthat is actually off of those\nnetwork servers and stuff.\n\n364\n00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:34.860\nWell, you expect to see them.\n\n365\n00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.690\nAnd if you actually get spikes in\ndifferent times of the day that you're\n\n366\n00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:40.600\nnot expecting, that again actually\nlet's you see that as well.\n\n367\n00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.090\nBut here you're also seeing the idea\nof run time and good quality control.\n\n368\n00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.610\n>> You know one that comes to mind,\nRonnie,\n\n369\n00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:48.730\nis the Action Center inside\nof Windows operating system.\n\n370\n00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:49.880\nThey have the Action Center and\n\n371\n00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.800\nthere's something known as\nthe Reliability Monitor.\n\n372\n00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.340\nAnd the Reliability Monitor gives\nyou a run chart over 30 days on\n\n373\n00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.610\nsome of the instances that\nhave happened on the machine.\n\n374\n00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.850\nWhether it's an application failure,\nmaybe it's not a failure.\n\n375\n00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.360\nRight, is it Windows that's failing?\n\n376\n00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.770\nAnd you can see a specific point in time,\nand what's going on,\n\n377\n00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:06.795\nwhat's causing the failure.\n\n378\n00:21:06.795 --> 00:21:10.000\nOr maybe you find out that it tried\nto run a couple of updates, and\n\n379\n00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.480\nthose updates didn't succeed, so\nit's another way that if you need,\n\n380\n00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.110\nif you do happen to have a Windows\nmachine, just go into your Action Center.\n\n381\n00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:19.300\nLook for the Reliability Monitor,\nand you get a good 30 day run chart.\n\n382\n00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.880\nGive you an example of\nRonnie's talking about here.\n\n383\n00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.690\n>> Yeah, that's a great one to actually\ntake a look at a single machine.\n\n384\n00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.670\nBut remember, inside your project,\n\n385\n00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:29.520\nyou might actually find that you're\nusing several Windows machine and\n\n386\n00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.840\nyou do need to see how these things\nhave been performing over time, and\n\n387\n00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.120\nwhether it's actually giving you the\nquality that you need to do everything.\n\n388\n00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.970\nSo if not, normally it actually also\ngives you the ability to correct those\n\n389\n00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:44.430\nby going in and actually telling you\nexactly what needs to be corrected\n\n390\n00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.920\nthat can actually help you out there,\ntoo, okay.\n\n391\n00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:51.500\nNow, our last one here is actually what we\ncall a cause and effect diagram as well.\n\n392\n00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.410\nThe more technical name to this is\nwhat we call an Ishikawa diagram,\n\n393\n00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:57.870\nis what we also call it too, okay.\n\n394\n00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.130\nSo let's take a look at this one, okay.\n\n395\n00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:04.432\nAn Ishikawa diagram is also known\nas a fishbone diagram as well.\n\n396\n00:22:04.432 --> 00:22:06.850\nNow you might be wondering,\nwhy is it called a fishbone diagram?\n\n397\n00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:13.270\nWell let me kind of show you,\nif I actually can draw a line like this.\n\n398\n00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:14.520\nI'll try and help you out here.\n\n399\n00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.890\nAnd we'll see.\n\n400\n00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:19.950\nAll right, so\n\n401\n00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:23.400\ntake this as being kind of the basic\nshape as what we're taking a look at.\n\n402\n00:22:26.634 --> 00:22:27.992\nAll right, so there you go.\n\n403\n00:22:27.992 --> 00:22:29.954\nDo you see the fish OS?\n\n404\n00:22:29.954 --> 00:22:30.512\n>> That's pretty good.\n\n405\n00:22:30.512 --> 00:22:31.893\n>> Not bad, okay.\n\n406\n00:22:31.893 --> 00:22:35.063\nSo that's why you also hear the term\nfishbone diagram in this and\n\n407\n00:22:35.063 --> 00:22:37.285\nI'm gonna leave that up there for\na moment.\n\n408\n00:22:37.285 --> 00:22:41.015\nI know it's gonna be annoying, but\nthis way if you hear Ishikawa,\n\n409\n00:22:41.015 --> 00:22:45.160\nfishbone diagram, notice cause and\neffect, is what we have.\n\n410\n00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.770\nSo what tends to happen inside\nof your particular project,\n\n411\n00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:52.520\nright, when you actually are dealing\na lot with quality control issues,\n\n412\n00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:56.580\nis that you have a problem that ends\nup happening on your project, okay?\n\n413\n00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:00.020\nSo there's the Problem Statement\nthat we're talking about.\n\n414\n00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:04.110\nNow that Problem Statement, normally\nagain, is actually the key here, okay?\n\n415\n00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:07.148\nSo we have another effect is\nwhat we're actually looking at.\n\n416\n00:23:07.148 --> 00:23:11.340\nSo we are looking at what actually did\nhappen and what we want to discover is\n\n417\n00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:16.230\nthe idea of the causes that could have\ncaused that particular problem statement.\n\n418\n00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.190\nSo when we start to actually\nlook at something like that,\n\n419\n00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:23.030\nwhat we do is we always ask that question.\n\n420\n00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:27.654\nWhat are the possible causes that\nwould actually give me this effect?\n\n421\n00:23:27.654 --> 00:23:32.526\nSo let's say that in this instance\nhere okay, if we were doing that,\n\n422\n00:23:32.526 --> 00:23:36.230\nthat I actually discovered\nlet's say some causes.\n\n423\n00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:39.200\nI'm just gonna copy this and\nmake it a little bit easier, okay?\n\n424\n00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:44.707\nSo, let's say that I could actually point\nto a materials type of defect, okay?\n\n425\n00:23:44.707 --> 00:23:50.354\nSo it could be that something actually\ndealing with the materials on\n\n426\n00:23:50.354 --> 00:23:55.914\nwhatever project that I'm on,\nthat that could be a possibility.\n\n427\n00:23:55.914 --> 00:24:02.773\nFrom there, I might actually say well, it\ncould be some type of Workmanship, okay?\n\n428\n00:24:02.773 --> 00:24:03.943\nIn other words, Workers.\n\n429\n00:24:07.531 --> 00:24:10.500\nOkay, so\nI'm gonna actually put that one there.\n\n430\n00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.380\nIt could be a process.\n\n431\n00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:19.530\nIn other words, let's say that what\nends up happening here is that\n\n432\n00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:23.130\nthere is some particular process\nthat's actually in place\n\n433\n00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:26.010\nthat I don't realize that's\ncaused this defect, as well.\n\n434\n00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:30.850\nAnd then, because I'm actually building\nsomething, let's say it's just\n\n435\n00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:35.620\nthe materials that I'm also using to\nnot actually build the thing itself but\n\n436\n00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.490\nactually just kinda keep\neverything together as well, so\n\n437\n00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:41.400\nwe'll talk about the idea of hardware,\nokay.\n\n438\n00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.200\nSo notice something like that.\n\n439\n00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.000\nNow, when you take a look,\n\n440\n00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.590\nright, these kind of look like\nfins that are off of the fish.\n\n441\n00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:50.330\nAt least that's what I'm\nhoping that it looks like,\n\n442\n00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.740\nright, fins on the fish,\nright, the dorsal fin and\n\n443\n00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:56.890\nthen you have the little side fin,\nthe flippers is what I normally call them.\n\n444\n00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:02.480\nAnd then you have, of course, those way\nback dorsal fins as well that you have.\n\n445\n00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.910\nSo, now,\nwhy is that actually important, then?\n\n446\n00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:10.490\nThe Ishikawa diagram allows me, now,\nto focus in on possible causes, right?\n\n447\n00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:15.609\nSo, if I believe that there is\na material defect here, okay, and\n\n448\n00:25:15.609 --> 00:25:23.906\nI say that this is what leads to\nthe cause, Here, I can now sit there and\n\n449\n00:25:23.906 --> 00:25:29.640\ngo, okay, what part of my materials\ncould lead to whatever that problem is?\n\n450\n00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.110\nAnd let's say at this particular\npoint here that this is some type of\n\n451\n00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:34.870\nsubstandard material.\n\n452\n00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.048\nSo, in other words,\n\n453\n00:25:37.048 --> 00:25:39.838\nI did not buy the quality material\nthat I thought I needed to buy.\n\n454\n00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:49.432\nSo there is some substandard material here\nthat I've ended up purchasing or using.\n\n455\n00:25:54.053 --> 00:25:58.937\nSo it could be that that\nparticular substandard material is\n\n456\n00:25:58.937 --> 00:26:04.720\nwhat's causing the materials to\nbe defective like that, okay.\n\n457\n00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.067\nSo I can say something like that.\n\n458\n00:26:06.067 --> 00:26:07.477\nLet's say about the workers here.\n\n459\n00:26:07.477 --> 00:26:08.946\nIf I go ahead and say,\n\n460\n00:26:08.946 --> 00:26:14.120\nwhat are the possibilities that\nthe workers themselves also caused this?\n\n461\n00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:19.398\nWell, it's very possible that\nthere may not be adequate training\n\n462\n00:26:25.249 --> 00:26:30.645\nSo it could be that the training,\nitself, was actually not adequate for\n\n463\n00:26:30.645 --> 00:26:36.690\nthe material or for the project,\nitself, and that led to the problem.\n\n464\n00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:42.301\nIt could be that the actual\navailability that I have here.\n\n465\n00:26:46.608 --> 00:26:51.402\nI didn't have enough workers\nto do what needed to be done\n\n466\n00:26:51.402 --> 00:26:55.890\nmight also have caused the issue, okay.\n\n467\n00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:59.589\nThen as we look at\nthe idea of the process,\n\n468\n00:26:59.589 --> 00:27:04.685\nalso essentially doing the same thing,\nas well, okay.\n\n469\n00:27:04.685 --> 00:27:10.580\nLet me angle it more this way to kind\nof make the graphic look here for\n\n470\n00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:13.400\nthe fish bone diagram.\n\n471\n00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.361\nAnd let's say here again, on the process,\nit was the wrong process.\n\n472\n00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:20.479\nIn other words,\nit was just not the right one.\n\n473\n00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.100\nLet's see if I can do that.\n\n474\n00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.299\nTry it again, oops.\n\n475\n00:27:28.118 --> 00:27:29.116\nCopy this.\n\n476\n00:27:36.012 --> 00:27:40.398\nSo it could be that I actually\nhad the wrong process order, so\n\n477\n00:27:40.398 --> 00:27:44.710\nwe did something out of order\nthat we shouldn't have done.\n\n478\n00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:49.766\nIt could be that we\nmissed a particular step.\n\n479\n00:27:54.084 --> 00:27:55.777\nSo it's very possible, and\n\n480\n00:27:55.777 --> 00:28:00.770\nhopefully what you're seeing is this\nidea of little fish bones, right?\n\n481\n00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:03.686\nEach of these are actually coming out and\n\n482\n00:28:03.686 --> 00:28:09.277\nthat's what we're also seeing here as\nwell as the same thing with hardware.\n\n483\n00:28:09.277 --> 00:28:11.182\nSo hardware stuff can break.\n\n484\n00:28:20.759 --> 00:28:22.220\nBroken hardware.\n\n485\n00:28:26.759 --> 00:28:31.230\nAnd this is what you start seeing,\nright, is that a lot of this here.\n\n486\n00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:35.660\nAnd that's what you're trying to do\nis trying to determine the causes.\n\n487\n00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.150\nSo this is where you would actually go and\n\n488\n00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:40.030\nnow hopefully you're seeing\nthat idea of the fish.\n\n489\n00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:44.780\nAnd now if I remove the actually\nkind of fishy part here, okay,\n\n490\n00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:48.640\nhopefully what you're seeing is that\nidea of that little kind of bony mess\n\n491\n00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.915\nthat's kind of left after you\nactually eat all the fish, as well.\n\n492\n00:28:51.915 --> 00:28:56.050\nMine's not as pretty as I'd\nlike to make it out to be, but\n\n493\n00:28:56.050 --> 00:29:00.020\nyou can see that this is the goal and\nthe idea, okay.\n\n494\n00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:04.900\nSo it allowed you to have a part in\nthe thinking process for quality control.\n\n495\n00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.230\nIf you can actually reduce\nwhat that problem is, right,\n\n496\n00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:12.820\nfigure out the effect here, then that\nessentially can allow you to lead to what\n\n497\n00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:17.920\nbig causes that then allow you to\nfocus in on the material, itself, and\n\n498\n00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.210\nwhat is wrong with that particular\nmaterial, which might be substandard here.\n\n499\n00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:24.346\nOr the actual workers that are actually\navailable, whatever it might be.\n\n500\n00:29:24.346 --> 00:29:27.770\nAnd you can actually continue to\nbranch that out if you want to.\n\n501\n00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:31.560\nTo make an even bigger fish\nis the whole goal, okay.\n\n502\n00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.838\nSo that's the idea of the process behind\nusing something like the Ishikawa diagram\n\n503\n00:29:35.838 --> 00:29:38.220\nto help you discover the cause and\neffect, and\n\n504\n00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.561\nthen to be build implement\nquality control.\n\n505\n00:29:40.561 --> 00:29:43.071\nIf it's a process issue,\nyou fix the missing process,\n\n506\n00:29:43.071 --> 00:29:45.050\nyou actually add that one back in.\n\n507\n00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:46.300\nOr if it's actually done\nin the wrong order,\n\n508\n00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.590\nyou actually correct the actual process,\nand\n\n509\n00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:52.850\nthereby actually implementing better\nquality back onto your project, as well.\n\n510\n00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:55.210\nSo all of these particular\ntypes of charts and\n\n511\n00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:59.280\ntools that we've actually been using are\nreally designed for the project manager\n\n512\n00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.710\nthen to be able to have a little bit\nmore control in that way, right?\n\n513\n00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:07.803\nTo be able to see where you're actually\ngonna spend the majority of your time and\n\n514\n00:30:07.803 --> 00:30:09.696\nmoney in fixing what you need to fix,\n\n515\n00:30:09.696 --> 00:30:12.894\nto take that idea of that histogram\njust a little bit, right?\n\n516\n00:30:12.894 --> 00:30:16.268\nTo see the overall defects and\nwhat they have actually caused over time,\n\n517\n00:30:16.268 --> 00:30:18.387\ncompare that to something\nelse if we need to.\n\n518\n00:30:18.387 --> 00:30:21.409\nAnd then the idea of the Ishikawa diagram,\nas well,\n\n519\n00:30:21.409 --> 00:30:25.900\nto be able to see where we might be able\nto focus in on on cause and effect, too.\n\n520\n00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.320\nBeing able to discover all of that really\ndoes help us to be able to implement\n\n521\n00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:34.320\nthe idea of quality control based on\nactual data that we have learned from\n\n522\n00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:38.020\nthe reporting processes that would\ncome back to us as a project manager.\n\n523\n00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.220\n>> Very good, Ronnie, that's right.\n\n524\n00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:43.730\nIn this episode we have looked at some of\nthe various tools that we use when we do\n\n525\n00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:48.240\nhave a product and it isn't meeting\nthe specifications defined by what we had\n\n526\n00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.280\ntalked about in a previous episode,\nand that is the quality base line.\n\n527\n00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.430\nThank you very much, Ronnie,\ngot anything else for this one?\n\n528\n00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:55.940\n>> No, not so much for this one,\nbut remember that there's\n\n529\n00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:59.500\nstill a lot more coming up for us, and\nwe'll see that in other episodes here.\n\n530\n00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:03.480\nBut remember that quality control\nis a big part of what we do and\n\n531\n00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.970\nlearning how to manage it.\n\n532\n00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:07.160\nWe’re not really doing the actually\nquality control, itself, but\n\n533\n00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:12.013\nwe're actually managing the very fact that\nit actually is there, and is something\n\n534\n00:31:12.013 --> 00:31:15.960\nthat actually can help us to take a look\nat it is taking the data that we get.\n\n535\n00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.930\nBeing able to put in something like\nthis allows us to be able to control it\n\n536\n00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:19.670\nmuch better.\n\n537\n00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:22.985\n>> Very good, I can't wait to see\nthat information, but until then,\n\n538\n00:31:22.985 -->

They begin by explaining the EVM and defining the components therein. This includes values like Planned Value(PV), Actual Cost(AC), and Earned Value(EV). Then they describe how to work with the efficiency indicators, Cost Variance and Schedule Variance. Finally, they work through Cost Performance Index, Schedule Performance Index, and To Completion Performance Index(TCPI).",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.061 --> 00:00:18.000\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.990\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our Project Plus Series.\n\n5\n00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.440\nJoining us back in the studio again\ntoday is our good friend and mentor Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.110\nRonnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.310\nRonnie welcome back to the show sir.\n\n8\n00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.320\n>> Well, thank you for having me.\n\n9\n00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.420\nAs we continue on to take a look into\nthe world of Comptia Project+, right?\n\n10\n00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.480\nWe're getting ready for\n\n11\n00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.010\nthe exam as well as actually making sure\nthat we understand the project management\n\n12\n00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.380\nconcepts, as we might be beginning\nour project management career.\n\n13\n00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.240\nOr we're just reviewing it to make sure\nthat we understand some of the tools and\n\n14\n00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.800\ntechniques that are available to us.\n\n15\n00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.250\nTo ensure that we're actually\ndoing it efficiently,\n\n16\n00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.190\nwe're actually doing\nwhat we need to as well.\n\n17\n00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.130\nRemember that in project management,\nit's not about following a set of rules.\n\n18\n00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.290\nIt's all about the idea of\nbest practices or guidelines.\n\n19\n00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.140\nYou can manage a project\nany way that you want to.\n\n20\n00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.024\nBut essentially all the project\nmanagers that are out there,\n\n21\n00:01:03.024 --> 00:01:05.720\nthat have come together and said,\nlook here's some basic guidelines.\n\n22\n00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.980\nAnd if you'll follow them,\n\n23\n00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.500\nyou end up being able to see your\nproject to a successful completion.\n\n24\n00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.740\nNow we are in the midst of our controlling\nand monitoring phase of our project.\n\n25\n00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.750\nNow that also means what?\n\n26\n00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.160\nThat we're actually inside\nthe execution phase as well\n\n27\n00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.520\nbecause there's no need\nactually monitoring and control\n\n28\n00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.540\nour particular project if we're not\nactually still executing our project too.\n\n29\n00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.740\nSo, that means what's going on?\n\n30\n00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.060\nThat means that progress is going on.\n\n31\n00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.740\nWork is going on.\n\n32\n00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.240\nMoney is being expended, right?\n\n33\n00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.290\nAnd hopefully that means other things\nare also getting completed as well.\n\n34\n00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.440\nSuch us our project requirements that\nwe have to make sure that we're moving\n\n35\n00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.590\nforward and we're producing what we\nneed to throughout our entire project.\n\n36\n00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.480\nNow once we have that actually going,\nit means that we also need some tools\n\n37\n00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.250\nthat are available to us to help us to be\nable to track a few different things, and\n\n38\n00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.380\na lot of that actually comes down to\nsome mathematical formulas that we\n\n39\n00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.860\ndefinitely need to pay attention to, and\nthat's what this show is about, okay?\n\n40\n00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.680\nSo there's sometimes\nwhat ends up happening,\n\n41\n00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.290\nright, is that we actually need to be\nable to take a look down the road and\n\n42\n00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.200\nactually kinda guess where\nwe are actually going to be.\n\n43\n00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.650\nThere are sometime we get some figures,\nand\n\n44\n00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.280\nwe're actually trying to figure out how\nmuch actually needs to be done to actually\n\n45\n00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.610\nhelp us to that point\nof completion as well.\n\n46\n00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.210\nSo there's a lot of things that we can do\nby using some simple mathematical formulas\n\n47\n00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.780\nand even though the terminology will\nsound a little bit strange, we're gonna\n\n48\n00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.670\nintroduce you to some scenarios that\nwill help you out and hopefully help\n\n49\n00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.470\nguide you through what we call the idea\nof the Earned Value Measurements.\n\n50\n00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.800\nNow Earned Value Measurements,\neven according to the PMP exam itself and\n\n51\n00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.330\nof course everything in that world.\n\n52\n00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.110\nThis is some of the most\nimportant types of formulas and\n\n53\n00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.850\nmaths that you can actually do.\n\n54\n00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.160\nThat will really help you to control and\nmonitor.\n\n55\n00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.590\nThese are what actually gives us\nindicators that tell us whether or\n\n56\n00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.120\nnot we need to kind of move a little\nbit faster on our project, or whether\n\n57\n00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.670\nactually we're doing okay, or whether we\nactually can take it easy a little bit.\n\n58\n00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.330\nThere's also some things that actually\ntell us how far off we are from our\n\n59\n00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.250\ninitial baseline as well.\n\n60\n00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.560\nAnd then there's some forecasting\ntypes of formulas out there\n\n61\n00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.860\nthat will essentially help us to\npredict the future in terms of cost and\n\n62\n00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.170\nthe elements that we actually\nhave to take a look at.\n\n63\n00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.720\nSo there's multiple formulas and so\n\n64\n00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.460\nwhat we wanna do is we wanna make sure\nthat we understand the terminology and\n\n65\n00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.560\nthen dive into a few examples\nthat we'll be going over.\n\n66\n00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.390\nSo when it begins with everything else,\n\n67\n00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.210\nlet's start with that terminology\nis where we want to begin.\n\n68\n00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.350\nSo that we actually have a familiar ground\nof some of the things that we'll be seeing\n\n69\n00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.220\nthroughout all the formulas that\nwe'll be taking a look at, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.660\nSo let's go ahead and take a look here,\nwhen we start with some basic terminology.\n\n71\n00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.550\nNow I'm gonna be using these\nacronyms inside of the formulas.\n\n72\n00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.030\nThat's why I wanted to\nintroduce it to us right now.\n\n73\n00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.370\nIf you are not familiar with them,\nmake sure you get familiar with them.\n\n74\n00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.820\nAnd what you want to do,\neven though Comptia and\n\n75\n00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.950\nof course the PnP have their officially\nterminology, it's actually more important\n\n76\n00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.100\nregardless of which exam that you\nare really preparing for, right?\n\n77\n00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.660\nThat you understand what\nthe concept really means.\n\n78\n00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.350\nDon't get me wrong,\n\n79\n00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.680\nlearning the official term and\ndefinition of something that is good, and\n\n80\n00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.770\nyou can pick up a lot of different study\nguides out there that will give you that.\n\n81\n00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.840\nBut what I wanted to do here is\ntalk about the terminology and\n\n82\n00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.410\nessentially put them into words that I\nwould use to help me understand it, and\n\n83\n00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.250\nalso hopefully to help you.\n\n84\n00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.560\nSo you may hear the term planned value.\n\n85\n00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.490\nWhenever you hear that term planned value,\na lot of times\n\n86\n00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.990\nyou are also gonna end up seeing it\ncalled something else, if you actually\n\n87\n00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.070\nlearned the project management from\nthe earlier editions of the Pen Bock.\n\n88\n00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.660\nThat's actually been out there.\n\n89\n00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.487\nLet me kind of move these down little bit.\n\n90\n00:04:43.487 --> 00:04:46.000\nI thought I spaced them out enough,\nbut apparently I did not.\n\n91\n00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.870\nSo you may also hear the term here,\n\n92\n00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.720\nwell, let me see if I can do\nthat a little bit better here.\n\n93\n00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.140\nGet that back down and\nchange the font color.\n\n94\n00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.890\nYou may also hear the acronym and\nthe term, the BCWS.\n\n95\n00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.290\nNow of course that's an acronym that\neverybody will actually use every day, but\n\n96\n00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.340\nit is actually descriptive\nof what we mean by it.\n\n97\n00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.470\nPlanned value kind of rolls off the lip,\nbut we don't really know what it means.\n\n98\n00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.376\nBut when you look at\nthe older terminology,\n\n99\n00:05:21.376 --> 00:05:26.430\nthis means budgeted\ncost of work scheduled.\n\n100\n00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.720\nNow, when we start talking in terms\nlike that and if you break that down,\n\n101\n00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.040\nyou kind of understand\nthe idea of budgeted cost.\n\n102\n00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.500\nBudgeted cost means what?\n\n103\n00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.970\nWell, this is something that\nwe've already budgeted.\n\n104\n00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.420\nIn other words we planned it out.\n\n105\n00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:45.180\nIf you start your brand new year of 2016\nlike we did just a few months ago and you\n\n106\n00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.880\nhave a budget where you're saying what,\nthis is how much we're planning to spend.\n\n107\n00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.660\nWell budgeted cost is\nsaying the same thing.\n\n108\n00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.435\nBut notice it actually\nbased on the work schedule.\n\n109\n00:05:54.435 --> 00:05:57.920\nIn another words, we're actually saying\nthat here is the plan spending that we're\n\n110\n00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.009\nactually gonna be doing.\n\n111\n00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:02.980\nAt any one particular point in\ntime is what we're talking about.\n\n112\n00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.713\nSo we're planning our spending\nis what we're taking a look at.\n\n113\n00:06:05.713 --> 00:06:09.628\nAnd so you'll see that idea of how much\nthat we had actually planned to spend\n\n114\n00:06:09.628 --> 00:06:11.560\non any one particular task.\n\n115\n00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.930\nSo just kinda realize that you\nmay hear terms like that as well.\n\n116\n00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:20.360\nNow the other one that you'll also hear\nIs gonna be of course the actual cost.\n\n117\n00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.339\nWell this actually just represents what we\nbelieve we spent, as our project is now\n\n118\n00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:29.812\nprogressing, how much money did we\nreally actually spend out there, and\n\n119\n00:06:29.812 --> 00:06:34.597\na lot of times in the older terminology\nas well, you'll see ACWP here, okay.\n\n120\n00:06:34.597 --> 00:06:37.610\nMake sure I actually wrote that\nterminology out right here.\n\n121\n00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:43.790\nAnd this is the actual\ncost of work performed.\n\n122\n00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:44.450\nOkay?\n\n123\n00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.280\nSo just like it says, right?\n\n124\n00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.630\nThe actual cost is the amount of money\nthat we've actually spent on what?\n\n125\n00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.510\nOn work that's actually been done for\nour project as well.\n\n126\n00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.220\nOkay?\n\n127\n00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.510\nSo we normally have to use some of these\nin combinations with formulas here.\n\n128\n00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.360\nSo there's a lot of times\nwhere we're talking about\n\n129\n00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.690\nthe idea of scheduling, okay?\n\n130\n00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.180\nOr we're using estimates,\n\n131\n00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.510\nwe're probably actually gonna\nuse this Planned Value right?\n\n132\n00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.360\nThink about it,\nthe budget is essentially what?\n\n133\n00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.070\nAn estimate of how much we believe\nthat our project is gonna cost.\n\n134\n00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.350\nHow much we believe that a particular\nwork package is gonna end up costing us.\n\n135\n00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.170\nThe actual cost is when we've done\nsomething and we can actually account for\n\n136\n00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.230\nthem with the expenses and\nstuff like that.\n\n137\n00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:29.150\nSo the actual cost of work performed here\napparently I zoomed down to 80% here.\n\n138\n00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:35.342\nLet me zoom back the actual size here and\nthen we'll get back to it.\n\n139\n00:07:35.342 --> 00:07:36.195\nAll right, and\n\n140\n00:07:36.195 --> 00:07:40.770\nthen there's another one too when we\ntalk about the Budget at Completion.\n\n141\n00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.760\nWhat we expected to spend\non the entire project.\n\n142\n00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.896\nSo a lot of times when you do something\nlike that and you actually do have\n\n143\n00:07:46.896 --> 00:07:50.478\nthe entire project budgeted out, you\nactually use that figure as well, okay.\n\n144\n00:07:50.478 --> 00:07:54.447\nAnd then this last one is the one that\nwe're actually trying to get to which\n\n145\n00:07:54.447 --> 00:07:57.072\nis the only one that's\nreally calculated out for\n\n146\n00:07:57.072 --> 00:08:01.316\nus a lot of times at the very beginning\nhere, is what we call that earned value.\n\n147\n00:08:01.316 --> 00:08:05.493\nNow this one is a little bit\ntricky in this sense here, okay.\n\n148\n00:08:05.493 --> 00:08:08.754\nSo when we talk about the idea\nof earned value, okay,\n\n149\n00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:12.510\nyou're actually doing\nan unusual comparison here.\n\n150\n00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:16.040\nYou're actually saying that at\nthis particular point in time,\n\n151\n00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.960\nthis is how much money we believe that\nthis particular work package is worth.\n\n152\n00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.248\nBut remember you also had and\nactually made a budget.\n\n153\n00:08:24.248 --> 00:08:27.771\nYou've completed that that\nparticular work package, and\n\n154\n00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:33.277\nyou can say 50% of that work package, when\nI budget it out, let's say it was $1000.\n\n155\n00:08:33.277 --> 00:08:37.191\nIf I have something like that,\nwhat can actually go on is I could say,\n\n156\n00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:40.027\nwell if the entire work\npackage cost $1000,\n\n157\n00:08:40.027 --> 00:08:44.027\nwell, what did I budget essentially for\nhalf of that work being done?\n\n158\n00:08:44.027 --> 00:08:47.480\nThat would be about $500\nis what I really budgeted.\n\n159\n00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.050\nSo if I actually compare that,\nI can say that at 50% of the work,\n\n160\n00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:56.360\nthe value then should\nequal about $500 as well.\n\n161\n00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.150\nSo we're gonna take a look at that\nvalue and see how that one works first.\n\n162\n00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:03.740\nSo normally the other things that we've\ntalked about here are usually provided for\n\n163\n00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.550\nus in the planning stage, is what we have.\n\n164\n00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.820\nAnd of course in the monitoring stage,\n\n165\n00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.640\nwe're getting the actual cost from\nreports as what we are seeing here.\n\n166\n00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.020\nSo let's take a look at these earned\nvalue again in a very simple formula for\n\n167\n00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.860\nus to help us out, and then we'll actually\nmove in to a little bit more complex one.\n\n168\n00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.611\nSo here's something like\nwhat I just told you.\n\n169\n00:09:23.611 --> 00:09:27.361\nSo it's now at the end of the first\nweek of this work package.\n\n170\n00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:31.500\nYou want to determine the earned\nvalue of the work package so far.\n\n171\n00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.360\nAt this point,\n\n172\n00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.210\nlet's say you're about a third of\nthe way through the entire work package.\n\n173\n00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:45.200\nYou know that you've budgeted to have only\nspent $1500 on the entire package here.\n\n174\n00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.360\nSo what is the earned value?\n\n175\n00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.940\nWell, the way that it's normally defined\nis, value of completed work to date\n\n176\n00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:56.700\ncompared to the budgeted value, okay,\nwhich is actually the planned value here.\n\n177\n00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.735\nSo, there's two components to\nthe earned value formula, okay.\n\n178\n00:10:00.735 --> 00:10:02.604\nThere is that planned value, and\n\n179\n00:10:02.604 --> 00:10:06.040\nwe're saying the entire work\npackage is about $1500.\n\n180\n00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.430\nAnd what we're told inside of\n\n181\n00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:16.080\nthe scenario that we're given, is that\nwe're about a third of the way through.\n\n182\n00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.010\nNow I just changed that to about 30%,\n\n183\n00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.000\nI could technically go up 33.33333 and\nkeep going here.\n\n184\n00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.110\nBut here's what the formula\nturns out to be.\n\n185\n00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.750\nSo in the way that the formula ends\nup working is that earned value\n\n186\n00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.020\nis where you take the planned value.\n\n187\n00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:38.276\nYou multiply it by the percent of the work\ncomplete at this point, for us it'd be at\n\n188\n00:10:38.276 --> 00:10:43.830\nabout 30%, so if I take my planned value\nof $1500, I multiply it by the 30% here.\n\n189\n00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:50.260\nMy earned value so far at 30% completion\nof this work package, about $500.\n\n190\n00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.980\nSo in theory, and actually in all reality,\n\n191\n00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.460\nyou should never get an earned value\nthat's ever higher than what the planned\n\n192\n00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.060\nvalue is gonna be, cuz you're\njust trying to really determine,\n\n193\n00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:06.420\nhow much is this that I've done so far on\nthis work package really worth right now?\n\n194\n00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.072\nAnd you're actually having that earned\nvalue and you're actually able to\n\n195\n00:11:09.072 --> 00:11:12.200\ndetermine that, based off of\nthe planning that you've already done.\n\n196\n00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.540\nSo that value's actually gonna\nbecome very important for us.\n\n197\n00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.550\nSo that's just a simple one that we\nactually use right at the beginning.\n\n198\n00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.880\n>> So Ronnie, really quickly, what we're\ndoing here is we're just basically using\n\n199\n00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:26.490\nthis calculation to make sure that\nwe are on track with the budget and\n\n200\n00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:28.270\nwith the percentage of\nwork that's been done.\n\n201\n00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.510\n>> Right, so far, right.\n\n202\n00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:33.220\nWe're trying to make sure that\nif we think that we're behind,\n\n203\n00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:37.850\nwe can use something like the earned\nvalue to say, at 50%, this is the amount\n\n204\n00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:41.290\nof money I should have actually spent\nbecause this is what it should be worth.\n\n205\n00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.640\nIf I now go back and\nactually track it against something else,\n\n206\n00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.455\nlike the actual amount\nof money that I spent,\n\n207\n00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:48.670\nI'll actually end up getting\na different number as well.\n\n208\n00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:49.580\nAnd that way we can do that.\n\n209\n00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.655\nBut this particular value,\n\n210\n00:11:50.655 --> 00:11:54.840\nyou're gonna see in everything else I will\ndo, which is the earned value here, okay?\n\n211\n00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.660\nSo let's take this a little bit more\ncomplicated here, but we've worked it out\n\n212\n00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:03.460\nin just about the same way so that I'm not\nchanging up anything on you too badly.\n\n213\n00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:07.700\nYou're now near the end of your project.\n\n214\n00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:13.093\nYour progress indicates that you're about\n93.5% complete of the project itself.\n\n215\n00:12:13.093 --> 00:12:17.950\nYou've budgeted $75,000 for\nthe entire project and\n\n216\n00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:23.510\nnow you want to determine,\nhow much is that particular value?\n\n217\n00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.680\nWell, it's simple.\n\n218\n00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.011\nYou take your planned value again,\nwhich is $75,000, and\n\n219\n00:12:29.011 --> 00:12:33.819\nthe percentage that they give you here,\nand you plug it into the formula.\n\n220\n00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:39.845\nSo in this particular one,\nI would actually take this PV here,\n\n221\n00:12:39.845 --> 00:12:43.611\nand we change that to $75,000.\n\n222\n00:12:43.611 --> 00:12:50.736\nAnd then, we would actually\nmultiply that by 93.5% here.\n\n223\n00:12:50.736 --> 00:12:53.580\nSo you actually see where that\nactually came out here, and\n\n224\n00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.990\nthat's what I wanted to show you.\n\n225\n00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.056\nSo when you actually take all of that out,\nand\n\n226\n00:12:59.056 --> 00:13:03.987\nlet me bring up a calculator here,\nbring up the good old Mac calculator.\n\n227\n00:13:03.987 --> 00:13:07.310\nIf I take $75,000 and\n\n228\n00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:11.880\nthen I multiply it by 0.935 here,\n\n229\n00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.200\nthat would give me $70,125.\n\n230\n00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:21.383\nNow what I am gonna do is I'm gonna round\nthat down, because 125 is not really much,\n\n231\n00:13:21.383 --> 00:13:26.212\nso we're just gonna say that this is\ngonna give us, let's say $70,000,\n\n232\n00:13:26.212 --> 00:13:29.670\nis what it's gonna end up giving us here.\n\n233\n00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:31.531\nNo matter what I do with that thing,\nit keeps popping in my way.\n\n234\n00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:38.794\nSo now, the earned value for\nthis project at 93.5% is\n\n235\n00:13:38.794 --> 00:13:42.870\nabout $70,000 is what I have, so\nthere's a little bit more for\n\n236\n00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:47.870\nme to spend all the way up to 100,\nbut I can actually say with a fairly\n\n237\n00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:52.140\naccurate estimate here,\nthat this is what's actually going on.\n\n238\n00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.445\nIs that my earned value up to this\npoint should be right around here.\n\n239\n00:13:55.445 --> 00:13:57.082\nI should again be able to go back and\n\n240\n00:13:57.082 --> 00:14:00.130\ntrack that and see how it actually\ncompares against the budget,\n\n241\n00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.736\nas well as how it compares\nagainst actual cost as well.\n\n242\n00:14:02.736 --> 00:14:07.132\nSo being able to do stuff like that, and\nthe key here, right, in getting ready for\n\n243\n00:14:07.132 --> 00:14:10.766\nthe actual exam itself,\nis to understand the formula, right, and\n\n244\n00:14:10.766 --> 00:14:13.956\nthose two components that\nare actually involved here, and\n\n245\n00:14:13.956 --> 00:14:16.420\nhow to calculate the earned value.\n\n246\n00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:17.700\nSo we gave you two examples,\n\n247\n00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:22.070\ntry and make it fairly the same, if you\nfollow those logical steps through and\n\n248\n00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.600\nyou can memorize that formula,\nit should make it very easy to calculate.\n\n249\n00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.880\n>> Yeah, it's not too difficult.\n\n250\n00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.280\nAnybody can do some multiplication,\nit's easy right?\n\n251\n00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.340\nPull out the calculator.\n\n252\n00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.940\nEven with large numbers, obviously,\nunless you're some sort of math savant and\n\n253\n00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.960\nyou can do that kind of math in your head.\n\n254\n00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.160\nYou're going to need a calculator for\nlarge numbers like that,\n\n255\n00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.740\nbut nothing too difficult.\n\n256\n00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:43.190\nYou could definitely throw down a piece\nof scratch paper and work those numbers.\n\n257\n00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:44.550\nNot an issue.\n\n258\n00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.245\nNow Ronnie, the one thing that\ndoes strike me about this though,\n\n259\n00:14:47.245 --> 00:14:49.318\nis it seems like these\nare perfect world numbers.\n\n260\n00:14:49.318 --> 00:14:51.244\n>> Right.\n>> And it is, with no variation,\n\n261\n00:14:51.244 --> 00:14:51.940\neverything.\n\n262\n00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.069\nWell, I got this and\nI got that, I plug it together.\n\n263\n00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:55.486\n[SOUND] Look, I'm right on track.\n\n264\n00:14:55.486 --> 00:14:58.050\nBut that doesn't tend to be reality.\n\n265\n00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.870\nThere's always gonna be\nhiccups in the plan.\n\n266\n00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:03.170\nOr people are doing more efficient\nwork than we thought they would and\n\n267\n00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.800\nthings are moving faster.\n\n268\n00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:09.300\nDo we try to make some sort of caveat for\nthat, or\n\n269\n00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.030\ndo we work that into our equations?\n\n270\n00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.250\n>> Well, you do actually have different\nequations that will tell you how you can\n\n271\n00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:18.550\nactually measure, that which is\nwhat we're also going to go into.\n\n272\n00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.640\nBut Dan, you make a great\npoint about the exam here.\n\n273\n00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.020\nI used some large numbers and I used\nreally small numbers, just to try and\n\n274\n00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.770\ngive you a range and to try and\nmake it feel a little bit comfortable.\n\n275\n00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.520\nBut the nice thing is on the exam\nbecause it is a timed exam,\n\n276\n00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.440\nyou're probably not gonna\nget large numbers like this.\n\n277\n00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.527\nI'm not gonna guarantee it.\n\n278\n00:15:33.527 --> 00:15:39.902\nFor all I know they could give you,\nyour budget is $3.62534 billion.\n\n279\n00:15:39.902 --> 00:15:40.661\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n280\n00:15:40.661 --> 00:15:45.960\nyou're trying to determine what the\nearned, it's in the realm of possibility.\n\n281\n00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.160\nIt's not in the realm of probability, but\nit is in the realm of possibility here.\n\n282\n00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.026\nBut don't underestimate that, all right.\n\n283\n00:15:52.026 --> 00:15:54.896\nI think what you'll end up seeing\nthe majority of the time, and\n\n284\n00:15:54.896 --> 00:15:58.866\nI can't really tell you for sure, is that\nthey'll probably be fairly round numbers.\n\n285\n00:15:58.866 --> 00:16:01.999\nSo that the math that you do can\nbe done very quickly on a small,\n\n286\n00:16:01.999 --> 00:16:05.917\ntiny calculator like this, or if you're\nlike me, you pull off your socks and\n\n287\n00:16:05.917 --> 00:16:09.450\nyour toes, and you start adding\nthem up and start multiplying.\n\n288\n00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.260\nYeah.\nYou could do stuff like that as well, so\n\n289\n00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.160\nthat's a great point for us to make.\n\n290\n00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.170\nNow, what Daniel's also talking about\nis what we call some type of efficiency\n\n291\n00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:22.410\nindicator, or variance indicators is what\nwe actually have to worry about, right?\n\n292\n00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.740\nSo there's a lot of things\nwe do as a project manager,\n\n293\n00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.620\nespecially in dealing with money and\n\n294\n00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:31.940\nespecially in dealing with time that we\nreally need to stay on top of, right?\n\n295\n00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.790\nThere's essentially three\nscenarios that we can go through.\n\n296\n00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.530\nWe're not gonna go\nthrough three scenarios.\n\n297\n00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:40.800\nBut essentially when we deal with time and\nwhen we deal with the cost, right?\n\n298\n00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.410\nWe can either be under cost, okay,\n\n299\n00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:47.440\nif that makes sense, or\nahead of schedule, all right.\n\n300\n00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.670\nWe could actually be over cost, right.\n\n301\n00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.150\nIn other words,\nwho spent way too much money and\n\n302\n00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:56.350\nwe could actually be beyond our schedule,\nokay, behind schedule.\n\n303\n00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:59.160\nIn other words, we're not actually\ngonna meet our deadline, okay.\n\n304\n00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.130\nYou're probably wondering,\nwhat the heck is the third one?\n\n305\n00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:05.500\nThird one is that we are smack\ndab right on schedule, and\n\n306\n00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.750\nwe actually have planned\nour cost down to that point\n\n307\n00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:12.780\nwhere we're spending exactly\nwhat we should spend, okay.\n\n308\n00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:17.220\nSo how do you know,\nwhat can you actually do to help you out,\n\n309\n00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.670\nto figure out where you actually\nare in terms of your efficiency?\n\n310\n00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.080\nOr your performance indicators\nthat we actually have.\n\n311\n00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.600\nSo we're gonna actually take a look\nat two different formulas here.\n\n312\n00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.980\nOne's called the cost variance, and one is\nalso called a schedule variance for us.\n\n313\n00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:31.970\nAnd then we'll move on.\n\n314\n00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.460\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna take a look at cost variance.\n\n315\n00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.040\nYou're near the end of your project.\n\n316\n00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.870\nYou want to determine if your project\nis ahead or behind in terms of cost.\n\n317\n00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.120\nNow I have schedule here.\n\n318\n00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.400\nBut that's what we wanna determine.\n\n319\n00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.640\nWe've already been given now\nthe information that we need to help us\n\n320\n00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.650\ndetermine this, which is the earned value.\n\n321\n00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.580\nIt just simply tells us $70,000.\n\n322\n00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:56.250\nNow, I already determined that in\nthe previous example that we just did.\n\n323\n00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.840\nBut let's say that we haven't done that.\n\n324\n00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.880\nWell, if they haven't given it to you,\ndon't worry about it, okay.\n\n325\n00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.440\nThe only time you really have\nto worry about determining that\n\n326\n00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.300\nis if they don't give you that instead.\n\n327\n00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.060\nBut right now, we're actually given that.\n\n328\n00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:10.370\nAnd you spent $71,000 for\nthe whole project so far.\n\n329\n00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:13.950\nCan you determine if the project\ncost is higher than expected or\n\n330\n00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.260\nlower than expected at this point?\n\n331\n00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.530\nSo what are we trying to do?\n\n332\n00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.900\nWe're trying to say,\nhere's what the cost should be, but\n\n333\n00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.310\nwhat I'm trying to\ndetermine is the variance.\n\n334\n00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.970\nIn other words, is it higher or\n\n335\n00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:26.350\nis it lower than what I'm\nactually expecting here?\n\n336\n00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:30.100\nSo in this particular formula, the way\nthis is done is the cost variance is\n\n337\n00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.510\nright here in this line,\nwhere it's actually the earned value and\n\n338\n00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:38.330\nthen you subtract out the actual\ncost up until that point, okay.\n\n339\n00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:43.500\nSo if we actually know this,\nwe're given that earn value, $70,000 and\n\n340\n00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.770\nI know at this point in time,\nI've actually spent $71,000 so\n\n341\n00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:52.200\nwe simply replace these numbers here and\n\n342\n00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:57.130\nyou're probably saying, Ronnie,\nthat actually is fairly easy.\n\n343\n00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.520\nYes, and\nthat's because I did that on purpose.\n\n344\n00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:03.784\nI actually made sure that the numbers were\nactually something I could subtract out\n\n345\n00:19:03.784 --> 00:19:07.875\nand not actually have to actually whip\nout a scientific calculator to do that.\n\n346\n00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:08.728\nSo, there it is.\n\n347\n00:19:08.728 --> 00:19:12.793\n70,000 minus 71,000, and\n\n348\n00:19:12.793 --> 00:19:18.067\nthat now leaves us with\na negative 1,000 here.\n\n349\n00:19:18.067 --> 00:19:21.410\nOur cost variance is a negative $1,000.\n\n350\n00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.460\nNow, what the heck does that mean?\n\n351\n00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:28.770\nWell, down here at the last line,\nthis is also a key factor for you.\n\n352\n00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:31.040\nIf you're actually trying\nto figure this out.\n\n353\n00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.990\nAre we ahead of schedule or\nare we behind schedule?\n\n354\n00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.800\nIf the number turns out to be a positive,\n\n355\n00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.260\nthen the cost right now is\nlower than what we expected.\n\n356\n00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:40.830\nOkay?\n\n357\n00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.270\nSo if I end up getting a positive number,\nokay.\n\n358\n00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:48.260\n$1,000, more than likely what\nthat actually means is my earn\n\n359\n00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:52.490\nvalue right now is actually\nsaying I'm ahead of the game.\n\n360\n00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:59.000\nMy value is higher than what I've\nactually spent on the project so far.\n\n361\n00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.430\nBut if the number is lower,\nthat actually shows you something.\n\n362\n00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:08.060\nI spent way more than even what\nthe value is on my project right now.\n\n363\n00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:09.780\nAnd that actually means what?\n\n364\n00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.030\nI'm gonna actually be on a cost over\nrun here that what I need to do is\n\n365\n00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:13.640\nfigure this out.\n\n366\n00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.520\nNow why is that good for\na project manager?\n\n367\n00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.140\nCuz it actually lets him know that I'm\na thousand dollars behind right now,\n\n368\n00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.260\nI need to look further\nahead in my project and\n\n369\n00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:25.960\ngo where the heck can I gain some of that\nback if I need to, and figure it out, or\n\n370\n00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:30.290\nfigure out where the expense came from\nhere and then make an adjustment for it or\n\n371\n00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:33.940\nat least figure out why I'm\n$1,000 over at this point.\n\n372\n00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:37.180\nSo not knowing that is\nactually kind of a bad thing.\n\n373\n00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.370\nWhere did the 1,000 go?\n\n374\n00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:42.560\nDid I just hand it to Daniel and Daniel\njust decided, hey it's pizza time for\n\n375\n00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.350\neverybody on the project no matter\nwhere they are on the planet.\n\n376\n00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.100\nSo it could be something like that,\nbut we just don't know.\n\n377\n00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.650\nSo at this point it at least\nshows me the variance.\n\n378\n00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.650\nAnd at least shows me I need\nto actually do something.\n\n379\n00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:55.960\n>> I assume this is where budget\nmanagers getting the really bad rap\n\n380\n00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.540\nof being the cutters of personnel,\nbecause this is exactly what happens.\n\n381\n00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.870\nThey've got finite amount of money and\nthey start running these equations and\n\n382\n00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:05.020\nsee, you know what?\n\n383\n00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:08.610\nWe're actually running out of\nmoney faster than we expected.\n\n384\n00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:12.070\nWe need to do something about that and a\nlot of times it ends up being a personnel,\n\n385\n00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:15.630\nbecause, well if we will lay somebody off,\nthen that money comes back and\n\n386\n00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.730\nwe have it in the budget\nto complete the project.\n\n387\n00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.530\nBecause the alternative is what?\n\n388\n00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.060\n>> Don't.\n>> We don't complete the project or\n\n389\n00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:24.150\nwe go into severe debt to\ntry to get it completed.\n\n390\n00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.820\nAnd normally they're not gonna do that,\nit's their project,\n\n391\n00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.850\nthey're in it to make money\nnot become more in debt.\n\n392\n00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:32.580\nSo a lot of times that happens,\nthe poor budget managers,\n\n393\n00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.500\nthey get the really bad end of\nthe stick in that one, Ronnie.\n\n394\n00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.760\n>> They really do, but it's actually\nvery good because it actually does allow\n\n395\n00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.720\nthem to go the project manager and say,\nwe need to figure out what happened here.\n\n396\n00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.440\nAnd that's actually what keeps\nyou on the game as well.\n\n397\n00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.210\nNow let's talk about that\nscheduled variance too, okay.\n\n398\n00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:48.720\nSo here it is.\nYou're near the end of your project.\n\n399\n00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.080\nYou wanna determine if your project\nis ahead of schedule or behind.\n\n400\n00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.990\nNow notice that we're actually\nusing dollar values for this, but\n\n401\n00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:56.730\nit's because of the way that\nyou planned it out right?\n\n402\n00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.020\nIf you budgeted so much money, and you\nknow this is where you're supposed to be,\n\n403\n00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:03.410\nin theory, right, you can use those\nsame numbers, even though it's money,\n\n404\n00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.230\nit's not necessarily time.\n\n405\n00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.440\nTo actually say, hey,\nI can actually use what I spent here or\n\n406\n00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.440\nwhat I have actually valued versus\nwhat I planned and figure this out.\n\n407\n00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.054\nSo here it is,\nyour earned value is $70,000.\n\n408\n00:22:15.054 --> 00:22:17.380\nYou budgeted $75,000 for\nthe whole project.\n\n409\n00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.170\nCan you determine if it is ahead or\nbehind schedule?\n\n410\n00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.230\nYou better believe that you can.\n\n411\n00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.330\nGiven that the components for\nthis formula,\n\n412\n00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.620\nright, is your earned value\nsubtracting out your plan value.\n\n413\n00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:32.620\nYou simply replace these numbers again\nif you know what the earned value is.\n\n414\n00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:36.580\nNow if you don't, that means you do\nhave to go back and calculate it.\n\n415\n00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:40.250\nNow I'm not gonna tell you that they\nwon't make you do that on the exam But\n\n416\n00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.660\nI will tell you that if they do,\n\n417\n00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:46.850\nmore than likely it's not gonna be\nnumbers even in this particular size.\n\n418\n00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:49.490\nA lot of times because you\nare in that time limit,\n\n419\n00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:51.590\nthey're gonna give you as\nmuch data as they can.\n\n420\n00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:54.160\nThey're hoping that you\nunderstand what the formula is.\n\n421\n00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.180\nA lot of times they're actually gonna ask\nyou questions about which of the following\n\n422\n00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.030\nwould you actually use\nin a scenario like this.\n\n423\n00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.600\nIf you're asking me about schedule and\nthe variance there,\n\n424\n00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.740\nI'm going to use schedule variance.\n\n425\n00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.320\nIf they're asking me about cost,\nI'm going to use the cost variance.\n\n426\n00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.270\nSo it actually does make sense.\n\n427\n00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.880\nSo on this one here,\nthis is gonna be a negative $5,000.\n\n428\n00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:16.740\nNow, remember that when\nwe start looking at it,\n\n429\n00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.740\nlike, and they want $5,000 on schedule,\nwhat the heck does that mean?\n\n430\n00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:23.650\nWell If you actually have\na positive number here,\n\n431\n00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:27.310\nit actually indicates that you\nare going to be ahead of the schedule\n\n432\n00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:31.390\nif the number happens to be well\na negative, then you're behind schedule.\n\n433\n00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:33.200\nNow why is that?\n\n434\n00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.824\nWell if you think about it,\nit actually does make sense here.\n\n435\n00:23:36.824 --> 00:23:41.672\nIf what I've valued my project at\nat this point Is actually a larger\n\n436\n00:23:41.672 --> 00:23:47.150\nnumber than what I had planned right\nnow at this point in my project.\n\n437\n00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:47.970\nIt actually means what?\n\n438\n00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:52.242\nHey, I actually did more work\nthan what I had planned to do in\n\n439\n00:23:52.242 --> 00:23:54.131\nthat same amount of time.\n\n440\n00:23:54.131 --> 00:23:55.056\nSo that means what?\n\n441\n00:23:55.056 --> 00:23:56.937\nI am ahead of schedule.\n\n442\n00:23:56.937 --> 00:24:01.863\nIf my earned value though is still\nless than what I planned at that\n\n443\n00:24:01.863 --> 00:24:03.971\nparticular point of time.\n\n444\n00:24:03.971 --> 00:24:09.232\nSo I measured against this date, here's\nhow much I believe my project valued at,\n\n445\n00:24:09.232 --> 00:24:11.916\nhere's how much I believe planned here.\n\n446\n00:24:11.916 --> 00:24:16.044\nIf my plan value is still larger, that\nmeans I gonna get a negative number and\n\n447\n00:24:16.044 --> 00:24:19.190\nthat means look,\nI'm actually behind schedule.\n\n448\n00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:23.110\nI should've spent this much at this point,\nbut I haven't actually done that.\n\n449\n00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:26.860\nWell why didn't I spend this much, more\nthan likely that actually indicates that\n\n450\n00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.120\nsomething hasn't been done which\nmeans you're behind schedule.\n\n451\n00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:34.360\nSo being able to use that earned value\nhere, actually helps you to be able to\n\n452\n00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:38.470\ndetermine these types of what we call\nefficiency indicators, that will really\n\n453\n00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:42.320\nhelp you be able to stay on top of\nyour project a little bit better and\n\n454\n00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:46.680\ncontrol, whether or not you need to\nactually hurry the schedule up, or\n\n455\n00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.350\nwhether or\nnot you actually can relax a little bit.\n\n456\n00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:50.640\nAnd the same thing with your cost as well.\n\n457\n00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.820\n>> Very, very cool, and that's nice to\nknow we have these formulas at our ready.\n\n458\n00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.310\nWe can use them to our benefit.\n\n459\n00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:56.660\nFigure out where we are in our project.\n\n460\n00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:57.650\nAre we going over budget?\n\n461\n00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:58.830\nAre we under budget?\n\n462\n00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:59.750\nHow are things working out?\n\n463\n00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:03.200\nIt just gives you a nice high level,\nbird's eye view of\n\n464\n00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.430\nhow the project is progressing\neither positively or negatively.\n\n465\n00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:09.260\nSo definitely learn these formulas,\nyou're gonna need them for the exam, so\n\n466\n00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.460\nyou might as well just learn them and\nuse them in your life as a project manager\n\n467\n00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.150\nbecause they're gonna be helpful for\nyou in that endeavor.\n\n468\n00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:19.770\nNow Ronnie when it comes to\nother ways of gauging whether or\n\n469\n00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:23.500\nnot we're doing well, or not well, are\nthere any other formulas they got for us?\n\n470\n00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.350\n>> There really are,\nthe ones that we just did, right?\n\n471\n00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:29.090\nWe talked about efficiency,\nare we ahead or are we behind?\n\n472\n00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:30.910\nBut what is our real\nperformance measurement?\n\n473\n00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:34.070\nWell, the good thing is there are several\nformulas that can help us out.\n\n474\n00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.910\nAnd one of the key ones that we rely on\nis what we call a Cost Performance Index.\n\n475\n00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:41.670\nNow, normally when we do this, we normally\nexpress it in terms of ratio, but\n\n476\n00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:45.882\nhere I'm just gonna go ahead and divide\nit out for us to be able to work with it.\n\n477\n00:25:45.882 --> 00:25:47.915\nYour're near the end of your project,\n\n478\n00:25:47.915 --> 00:25:52.395\nyou want to determined if your project\ncost is better than expected, okay.\n\n479\n00:25:52.395 --> 00:25:57.215\nYour earned value is $70,000, you've spent\n$71,000 you must determine if your cost\n\n480\n00:25:57.215 --> 00:26:00.385\nperformance index,\nyou must determine cost performance index,\n\n481\n00:26:00.385 --> 00:26:04.015\ndetermine if cost is better\nthan expected or worse.\n\n482\n00:26:04.015 --> 00:26:07.529\nSo, when you take a look at this formula,\nyou'll see that she looks fairly\n\n483\n00:26:07.529 --> 00:26:10.170\nsimilar or to some of the formulas\nthat we already done.\n\n484\n00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:13.220\nAnd what we're trying to do is we're\ngonna take the earned value and\n\n485\n00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:17.920\nwe are actually going to put it\nover the actual cost at this point.\n\n486\n00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:22.190\nSo when we do something like this, notice\nthat it's actually going to be something\n\n487\n00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:25.370\na little bit more complex then\nwhat we've been seeing here.\n\n488\n00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:29.355\nWe're going to take our $70,000,\noops, if I can.\n\n489\n00:26:29.355 --> 00:26:37.989\n$70, 000 and\nthe we're gonna divide it by our $71, 000.\n\n490\n00:26:37.989 --> 00:26:42.250\nIs what we're going to do, and what we're\nactually trying to determine is that\n\n491\n00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:46.380\nnumber is actually gonna be\ngreater than one or less than one.\n\n492\n00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.650\nWell, I don't really need to\ndetermine what the actual value is,\n\n493\n00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.560\nas far as an actual definite value.\n\n494\n00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.410\nI just need to know is it larger\nthan one or less than one.\n\n495\n00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:59.980\nSo if I do 70 divided by 71,\njust to take away the zeroes,\n\n496\n00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.130\nright, I know I'm gonna\nget a decimal number.\n\n497\n00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.060\nThat's what's gonna end up happening,\nokay.\n\n498\n00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:09.360\nNow, if I actually had an earned value\nthat was higher, I would get a 1.\n\n499\n00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.010\nsomething.\n\n500\n00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:11.740\nOkay, is what would happen.\n\n501\n00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.110\nSo here's the value\nthat we take from this.\n\n502\n00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:19.710\nIf the cost is greater than one,\nthen right now my cost in performance so\n\n503\n00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.440\nfar is better than I expected to do.\n\n504\n00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.040\nOkay.\n\n505\n00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.580\nAnd that means right now\nthe value that I have\n\n506\n00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:28.990\nis actually worth more than\nwhat I've actually expended.\n\n507\n00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.260\nBut if it's less than one,\n\n508\n00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:35.430\nthat means right now the earn value is\nnot as much as I have actually what?\n\n509\n00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:37.720\nSpent on my project as well.\n\n510\n00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.550\nSo the cost performance index\nis one way that we can do that.\n\n511\n00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:45.430\nRemember, we're not trying to\ndetermine the actual, super number,\n\n512\n00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:46.380\nyou can if you want to.\n\n513\n00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.840\nAnd then later on I should determine\na cumulative type of cost index for\n\n514\n00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.560\nthe entire project, but for\n\n515\n00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.900\nus we're actually just doing\nit on a single work package or\n\n516\n00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.690\nwhere we're actually given here a\nscenario, we can actually do that as well.\n\n517\n00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:00.420\nThe reason why you might do the rest is if\nyou're trying to trend the data a little\n\n518\n00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.820\nbit instead and you can do that.\n\n519\n00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.740\nSo there's a cost performance index and\n\n520\n00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:09.250\nalso means that there's a schedule\nindex that does the same thing, okay.\n\n521\n00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:10.530\nSo here is the same thing, and\n\n522\n00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:13.880\nyou actually see that I really didn't\nchange much of the wording except for\n\n523\n00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.270\nyou have to determine the scheduled\nperformance index to determine whether\n\n524\n00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:22.260\nyou're ahead of schedule or whether you're\nactually behind the schedule as well.\n\n525\n00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.920\nSo here it is.\nWe're taking those same numbers and\n\n526\n00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:29.210\nnotice here, the earned value\nnow over the planned value.\n\n527\n00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:31.250\nWhereas then the cost performance, right,\n\n528\n00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:34.360\nwe actually had the earned value over\nthe actual cost, what we actually spent.\n\n529\n00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:38.190\nHere we're saying,\ntake the earned value and\n\n530\n00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:42.040\nplace that over and\ndivide by what I had planned to spend.\n\n531\n00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:42.740\nOkay?\n\n532\n00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:50.030\nSo if that number again is still\nthe same thing as the 70, oops 70,000\n\n533\n00:28:55.545 --> 00:28:59.944\nDivided by the 71,000 here.\n\n534\n00:28:59.944 --> 00:29:05.060\nAnd what I'm looking for is the number\nthat actually comes out from that, right?\n\n535\n00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:08.358\nSo if this one again is actually the,\nwell, greater than one.\n\n536\n00:29:08.358 --> 00:29:10.090\nThat means I'm ahead of schedule,\n\n537\n00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:13.730\nif the number that I get here is actually\na decimal point, a smaller than one.\n\n538\n00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.230\nThat means I am behind schedule as well.\n\n539\n00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:17.840\nAnd that makes sense, right?\n\n540\n00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.350\nIf my schedule is the planned\nvalue right here, okay?\n\n541\n00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:23.620\nSo in other words, that's what I had\nbudgeted, that's what I had planned,\n\n542\n00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:27.180\nthat's what I had scheduled according\nto the beginning of my project plan.\n\n543\n00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:32.330\nWell if that number is greater than what\nI've actually value it at right now,\n\n544\n00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:34.640\nthen more than likely,\nright I'm gonna get,\n\n545\n00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:39.210\nwell, less than one which means I\ndidn't actually spend enough again.\n\n546\n00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:41.460\nSame thing,\nif it's actually greater than one,\n\n547\n00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:42.970\nI've actually got\nsomething that says what?\n\n548\n00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:45.050\nI'm actually ahead of schedule\ncuz I've gotten what?\n\n549\n00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:48.490\nMore value out of it then what\nI had previously scheduled.\n\n550\n00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:53.258\nSo there are a lot of these indexes that\nyou do need to take a look at as well and\n\n551\n00:29:53.258 --> 00:29:56.744\ntake advantage of as yes you\nactually start paying more\n\n552\n00:29:56.744 --> 00:29:59.050\nattention to this in the future.\n\n553\n00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:03.110\nSo these performance indexes are there,\nthere's one more performance index I wanna\n\n554\n00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:07.680\ntake a look at and then even though we've\ngot a little bit more we may need to\n\n555\n00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.900\nsave the others ones as far as forecasting\njust for a part two here briefly.\n\n556\n00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.690\nSo we'll take a look at our value and\n\n557\n00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:20.205\nour time here and see what will\nmake an index and figure it out.\n\n558\n00:30:20.205 --> 00:30:21.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we have one more.\n\n559\n00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.510\nAnd let's deal with this one here.\n\n560\n00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:28.880\nWe need to actually do what we call\na To Completion Performance Index.\n\n561\n00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.800\nNow, this is by far the most complicated\nformula we've taken a look at here.\n\n562\n00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:33.470\nOkay?\n\n563\n00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:38.530\nAnd we've now actually introduced a new\nelement to this which is the budget\n\n564\n00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.380\nat completion here.\n\n565\n00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:44.630\nAnd notice that what we're actually doing,\nokay, when we do this.\n\n566\n00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:45.410\nOkay?\n\n567\n00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:49.390\nYou're near the end of your project,\nyou want to estimate your project costs,\n\n568\n00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:51.030\nyou spent $71,000.\n\n569\n00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:56.760\nYou value the project at $70,000 for the\n93 and a half percent of work completed.\n\n570\n00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:01.249\nYour BAC,\nyour budget at completion was $75,000.\n\n571\n00:31:01.249 --> 00:31:05.130\nNow, what you're trying get to is,\ncan I actually finish the project?\n\n572\n00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:08.870\nAt what I said I wanted to budget\nit out at completion, okay.\n\n573\n00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:13.250\nSo, what this is gonna give us is whether\nor not we actually need to work harder,\n\n574\n00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:16.320\nokay, or whether or not we can actually\nlet everything kind of coast in\n\n575\n00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:20.320\nthe way that needs to,\nto finish our budget at completion.\n\n576\n00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.270\nSo that's what we have here.\n\n577\n00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:25.530\nSo here we simply take\nthe values that we're given.\n\n578\n00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.100\nThe BAC is $75,000.\n\n579\n00:31:32.198 --> 00:31:37.263\nAnd then,\nI subtract out the earned value which is\n\n580\n00:31:37.263 --> 00:31:42.208\ngonna be 70,000, and then we're going to\n\n581\n00:31:42.208 --> 00:31:47.169\ndivide that again by,\nwell the other side here.\n\n582\n00:31:47.169 --> 00:31:54.181\nAnd then subtract that to here,\nwhich is going to be 71,000.\n\n583\n00:31:54.181 --> 00:31:58.990\nLike this So now that won't let\nme duplicate this thing here for\n\n584\n00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:00.740\na second, oops!\n\n585\n00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.820\nThat's not what I wanted to do, wrong one.\n\n586\n00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:03.649\n>> Undo Ronnie!\n\n587\n00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:04.695\n>> Crud.\n\n588\n00:32:04.695 --> 00:32:09.720\nI undo the wrong thing, all right,\nso here we go away again.\n\n589\n00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.951\nFigures I would do this at\nthe last one here on this one, so\n\n590\n00:32:13.951 --> 00:32:16.962\nlet's try it again, $75,000.\n\n591\n00:32:18.762 --> 00:32:20.003\n$70,000.\n\n592\n00:32:23.778 --> 00:32:25.775\nSame thing, $75,000.\n\n593\n00:32:29.246 --> 00:32:31.185\nAnd $71,000.\n\n594\n00:32:34.145 --> 00:32:36.830\nOops, add a percent sign there,\nthat's pretty bad.\n\n595\n00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:41.460\nI was trying to duplicate this,\ncopy, paste here, and so\n\n596\n00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:44.956\nnow when we take a look\nat this formula here,\n\n597\n00:32:44.956 --> 00:32:49.604\nthat'd be 75- 70, and\nthat would be $5,000.\n\n598\n00:32:53.424 --> 00:32:59.590\nHere divided by well $4.000\nis what it looks like.\n\n599\n00:33:03.015 --> 00:33:07.450\nI must have actually missed a, subtracted\nhere so, yep that looks good okay.\n\n600\n00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:12.860\nSo there is what it breaks down to and\nnow when we take a look\n\n601\n00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:17.450\nis actually what 5.000 divided by\n4,000 and what am I should gonna get?\n\n602\n00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:20.700\nI'm gonna actually going\nto get a number and\n\n603\n00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:22.810\nthis is where we have to\nscroll down a little bit.\n\n604\n00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:28.000\nI didn't realize that I had not pulled\neverything up here and why we want it.\n\n605\n00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.570\nSo that number is gonna be greater than\none that's what we're gonna see, and\n\n606\n00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:35.710\nnow if I can actually pull that\nlast little element up, okay?\n\n607\n00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:43.020\nSo this is what we're actually hoping for,\nideally, I'm looking for\n\n608\n00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:48.870\na 1, in other words,\nthat what I'd actually spent here, okay?\n\n609\n00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:52.760\nMake sure I said that right, no, what I've\nactually valued here is actually the same\n\n610\n00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.787\nas essentially what I've spent is what\nwe're gonna actually end up seeing.\n\n611\n00:33:55.787 --> 00:34:01.490\nIf a 1, we continue on your same progress\ntrack, we're ready to go, no big deal,\n\n612\n00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:05.898\nbut if we get a number greater\nthat 1 at this point, okay?\n\n613\n00:34:05.898 --> 00:34:09.470\nSo in other words, at this point right\nhere, the way that this formula actually\n\n614\n00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:13.530\nworks out here is that,\nit actually means, you need to work a lot\n\n615\n00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:18.750\nharder to ensure that you can actually\ncomplete your budget, at completion.\n\n616\n00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:23.210\nAnd if it's less than 1 at this point,\nthen that means it's gonna be easier\n\n617\n00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:26.030\nas well, we actually want\nto take a look at as well.\n\n618\n00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:30.090\nSo in that sense, you do have that ability\n\n619\n00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:34.620\nto be able to use something like this so\nyou can go back to your project and\n\n620\n00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.920\nto the people on it and go, look,\nwe need to work a lot harder.\n\n621\n00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:43.130\nOr we can actually work as we're doing, or\nwe can actually afford a slack day or two\n\n622\n00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:46.040\nand make sure that things actually go and\nwe don't have to actually worry about it.\n\n623\n00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.560\nWe're scheduled to finish exactly on time.\n\n624\n00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.400\nSo these types of performance indexes,\nalong with the various indexes that we\n\n625\n00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:57.000\ntalked about, and even the earned value\nand stuff, very good formulas for\n\n626\n00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.830\nus to actually pay attention to.\n\n627\n00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:02.140\nBut we do need to look at forecasting just\na little bit more, this is a little bit of\n\n628\n00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.140\nforecasting, but we still have estimates\nthat we actually have to complete and do.\n\n629\n00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:08.340\nAnd we just need to go ahead and\njust make that a part two.\n\n630\n00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.600\n>> Well that's not a problem Ronnie,\n\n631\n00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.690\nthe great thing about this show\nis we can do as many as we like.\n\n632\n00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:14.230\nSo we look forward to\nseeing you in part two and\n\n633\n00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:18.050\nwe'll check out those forecasting\nequations that you have for us.\n\n634\n00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:21.390\nAnd we thank you guys for watching,\nhopefully we'll see you there in part two.\n\n635\n00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:24.050\nAnd as far as this episode goes,\nwe're gonna wrap it up for ITProTV,\n\n636\n00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:25.970\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n637\n00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:26.650\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n638\n00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:28.329\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n639\n00:35:28.329 --> 00:35:35.028\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.654 --> 00:00:18.295\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n4\n00:00:18.295 --> 00:00:21.100\nin today's episode we\nare continuing on with Project+.\n\n5\n00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.655\nActually at part 2 finishing up some\nequations to help you make sure\n\n6\n00:00:24.655 --> 00:00:27.170\nyou're staying on track and\nunder budget with your projects.\n\n7\n00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.190\nJoining us back in the studio\nto help figure those out for us,\n\n8\n00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.880\nand show us what we gotta do to make that\nhappen, none other than Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n9\n00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.030\nRonnie, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n10\n00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.640\n>> Well thank you for\nhaving me back on the show,\n\n11\n00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.490\nas we continue on with\nour CompTIA Project+.\n\n12\n00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.890\nAnd we are taking a look at just a few\nextra formulas that we really didn't have\n\n13\n00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.960\ntime to jam into our formula\npacked show last time.\n\n14\n00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.120\nSo we've talked a little bit about some\nforecasting that we can do to help us to\n\n15\n00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.390\ncheck out whether or not we actually\nneed to do something about something, or\n\n16\n00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.880\nwhether we can actually stay in line and\non track on a few different things and\n\n17\n00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.250\nnot worry about it.\n\n18\n00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.956\nSo let's just go ahead and jump right in\nand we'll finish these formulas up and\n\n19\n00:01:02.956 --> 00:01:06.283\nbe able to actually understand that\nthey really are gonna help us out.\n\n20\n00:01:06.283 --> 00:01:08.332\nSo one of the things that we want to do,\n\n21\n00:01:08.332 --> 00:01:11.545\nis actually do what we call\nan Estimate At Completion here.\n\n22\n00:01:11.545 --> 00:01:14.508\nNow, when we take a look at\nthis Estimate At Completion,\n\n23\n00:01:14.508 --> 00:01:17.736\nthe formula is actually fairly\neasy when you take a look at it.\n\n24\n00:01:17.736 --> 00:01:22.935\nIt actually is the actual cost, plus\nsomething that we haven't seen before,\n\n25\n00:01:22.935 --> 00:01:28.076\nwhich is what we call the Estimate To\nCompletion at this point as well, okay.\n\n26\n00:01:28.076 --> 00:01:30.091\nNow when we start taking a look at it,\n\n27\n00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:32.634\nwhat does that\nEstimate To Completion about?\n\n28\n00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:37.809\nThe Estimate To Completion is actually\nthe amount of work that we actually report\n\n29\n00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:43.152\nin dollar values or in cost value here,\nabout the remaining work to be done, okay.\n\n30\n00:01:43.152 --> 00:01:45.563\nIn other words, this is the stuff\nthat we didn't get complete.\n\n31\n00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:49.564\nWe actually understand that when we take a\nlook at actual cost, right, we've actually\n\n32\n00:01:49.564 --> 00:01:53.474\nsaid here's the amount of money that we've\nactually spent right now on our project.\n\n33\n00:01:53.474 --> 00:01:58.198\nBut when you take a look at Estimate To\nCompletion, we're actually talking about\n\n34\n00:01:58.198 --> 00:02:02.373\nthe remaining work and how much value\nthat that actually is going to be for\n\n35\n00:02:02.373 --> 00:02:05.140\nus to actually be able to complete here.\n\n36\n00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.780\nSo here it is, you're near the end of your\nproject, you want to estimate your project\n\n37\n00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.770\ncost at this point, and you're actually\ntalking about an estimate of that cost.\n\n38\n00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.080\nYou know that you spent $71,000 and\nthat will be your actual cost.\n\n39\n00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.700\nAnd right now, you're estimating\nthat you're about $9,000 that\n\n40\n00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.570\nyou're gonna have to spend to finish\nup the project's remaining work.\n\n41\n00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.070\nYou must now determine\nthe Estimate At Completion,\n\n42\n00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.770\nis what you have to actually determine.\n\n43\n00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.000\nNotice how much is your particular budget\nnow, or your cost actually gonna be\n\n44\n00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.940\nat the completion, because even though\nyour budget at completion is $75,000,\n\n45\n00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.220\nyou don't know if your actually gonna\nbe over or under at this point.\n\n46\n00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.660\nSo how much over or under\nthe Budget At Completion are you gonna be?\n\n47\n00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.010\nAnd what does that actually indicate\nwhen you take a look here, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.278\nSo, when you take a look at those\ncomponents and the Estimate At Completion,\n\n49\n00:02:56.278 --> 00:03:00.153\nyou take the actual cost for us and\nwe'll just replace these numbers so\n\n50\n00:03:00.153 --> 00:03:01.484\nthat we can see it here.\n\n51\n00:03:01.484 --> 00:03:06.451\nWhich is the $71,000, and\nthen we are given the value of this\n\n52\n00:03:06.451 --> 00:03:11.867\nEstimate To Completion,\nwhich is gonna be, well $9,000, okay.\n\n53\n00:03:11.867 --> 00:03:17.759\nSo now, I have my\nEstimate To Completion at 80,000, okay.\n\n54\n00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:20.840\nAgain, these numbers I\njust picked that I knew\n\n55\n00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.470\nthat I could add up fairly easily here,\nis what we wanted to do.\n\n56\n00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.240\nSo the reason why this is important,\nis that when you take a look,\n\n57\n00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:35.095\nif you know what your original\nBudget At Completion, which was $75,000.\n\n58\n00:03:35.095 --> 00:03:38.600\nOkay, and\nnow your Estimate At Completion is 80,000,\n\n59\n00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:44.220\nwell then you know something, that right\nnow wherever you are in your schedule,\n\n60\n00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.700\nthat if you were to complete this project\nyou're estimating that you have overspent\n\n61\n00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.465\nwhatever you have budget period, okay?\n\n62\n00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:56.050\nBut why is that important if I'm not close\nto completing my entire project yet?\n\n63\n00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.130\nIt means you still have time to do what?\n\n64\n00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.790\nTo be able cut some costs.\n\n65\n00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.718\nYou still have time to be able to get\nthings back on track, and maybe actually\n\n66\n00:04:04.718 --> 00:04:09.507\nfinish closer, if not actually right\nat your Budget At Completion here.\n\n67\n00:04:09.507 --> 00:04:13.525\nAnd that's the key behind determining\nwhy you would actually do that\n\n68\n00:04:13.525 --> 00:04:15.887\nEstimate At Completion as well, okay.\n\n69\n00:04:15.887 --> 00:04:19.727\nSo this is actually something that\nreally does give you that factor to be\n\n70\n00:04:19.727 --> 00:04:20.860\nable to do.\n\n71\n00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.271\nNow that doesn't mean you'll\nalways be able to do this,\n\n72\n00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:25.493\nit depends on where you\nare in your project, right?\n\n73\n00:04:25.493 --> 00:04:28.491\nSo let's say you're at 96% complete,\n\n74\n00:04:28.491 --> 00:04:33.321\nwell if you've actually determine\nyour EAC as being 80,000,\n\n75\n00:04:33.321 --> 00:04:38.669\nsuch as your $9000, or no,\nnot 9000, $5000 over, right.\n\n76\n00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.245\nAnd you're at 96% complete,\n\n77\n00:04:40.245 --> 00:04:43.010\nif you add up the whole thing\nyou might find out something.\n\n78\n00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.561\nThere's no way I can actually\ncut $5000 in cost anywhere,\n\n79\n00:04:46.561 --> 00:04:50.571\nregardless of what you do, except to\nautomatically stop right now, and\n\n80\n00:04:50.571 --> 00:04:53.948\nyou might be able to come close,\nwell then it doesn't help.\n\n81\n00:04:53.948 --> 00:04:58.105\nSo what you might actually be doing here,\nis throughout the project,\n\n82\n00:04:58.105 --> 00:05:01.910\nis that you're actually using\nthis particular formula to see,\n\n83\n00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.736\nam I right now tracking\nto actually overspend?\n\n84\n00:05:04.736 --> 00:05:06.955\nOr am I tracking where\nI'm not overspending and\n\n85\n00:05:06.955 --> 00:05:08.850\nthat's what you want to keep a track of.\n\n86\n00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.970\nIt is actually something that you might\ndepend on other people for, right?\n\n87\n00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.600\nLike the idea of the accounting\noffice to help you out.\n\n88\n00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.869\nBut overall though, this is a very\nimportant number that you at least need to\n\n89\n00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:23.256\nknow what it means, right, if you actually\nwanted to do something like this.\n\n90\n00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:27.100\n>> Yeah Ronnie, from what you just said,\nit really sounds like doing this at\n\n91\n00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.130\nthe beginning of the project and keep on\ngoing with it to make sure that you stay\n\n92\n00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.364\non budget and stay on schedule, is a\nbetter idea than going, it's been a while.\n\n93\n00:05:35.364 --> 00:05:40.950\nMaybe we should run these calculations and\nsee what our projections are gonna be.\n\n94\n00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.638\nBecause if you get to that 96%,\nlike you said,\n\n95\n00:05:43.638 --> 00:05:47.426\nyou literally have no time left in\nwhich to rectify the issue, right?\n\n96\n00:05:47.426 --> 00:05:49.546\n>> Yeah,\nyou definitely don't want to do that, and\n\n97\n00:05:49.546 --> 00:05:52.940\nthat's why it's important that we learn\nthese particular types of formulas.\n\n98\n00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.080\nSo everything that we've gone\nover in the previous part 1\n\n99\n00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.180\nof this particular episode,\n\n100\n00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.290\nand what we're going over now, yes you do\nwant to learn them for the exam, no doubt.\n\n101\n00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.218\nBut at least having an idea of what\nyou need to do to actually figure out,\n\n102\n00:06:07.218 --> 00:06:10.600\nam I going to finish at\nthe budget that I thought?\n\n103\n00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.585\nWell how do you do that?\n\n104\n00:06:11.585 --> 00:06:13.878\nWell, this the formula you use to do that.\n\n105\n00:06:13.878 --> 00:06:16.740\nYou try and determine how much\nwork is remaining to be done and\n\n106\n00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.180\nthe value to that, and then you go, here's\nwhat I had actually budgeted to finish at,\n\n107\n00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.500\nand then notice that all you have\nto do is add those really together.\n\n108\n00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.808\nAnd I mean,\nthe amount of money that you spent,\n\n109\n00:06:26.808 --> 00:06:29.776\nand what you believe is gonna\ntake you to finish the project.\n\n110\n00:06:29.776 --> 00:06:31.982\nCompare that to your Budget At Completion,\n\n111\n00:06:31.982 --> 00:06:34.494\nthat will actually help\nyou out here incredibly.\n\n112\n00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:38.395\nBut Daniel is correct, keeping on\ntop of that is absolutely a key,\n\n113\n00:06:38.395 --> 00:06:42.870\nespecially at least during what we\ncall those project phase gates, right.\n\n114\n00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.900\nAs you're actually turning over and\nmaking those decisions of go and no go.\n\n115\n00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.100\nYou might actually find out,\nlet's say 30% into the project,\n\n116\n00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.884\nthat you're already tracking to actually\nblow away the budget by 10 to $15,000.\n\n117\n00:06:57.884 --> 00:07:01.089\nYou might go, no, I don't wanna do that,\nand you're right, okay.\n\n118\n00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:05.098\nSo if you make a rash decision at that\npoint, you may actually go ahead and\n\n119\n00:07:05.098 --> 00:07:08.336\nstop the entire project at that point,\njust based on one.\n\n120\n00:07:08.336 --> 00:07:11.979\nBut a lot times, if you know that\nwait a minute I still got 70%,\n\n121\n00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:16.019\n60% of the project to go, and\nthat there's actually stuff that I know\n\n122\n00:07:16.019 --> 00:07:19.270\nthat we can actually work\nout to keep us back online.\n\n123\n00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.354\nWell, that actually\nmakes a big difference.\n\n124\n00:07:21.354 --> 00:07:25.456\nIf you don't know any of that anywhere\nalong the project, you just have to come\n\n125\n00:07:25.456 --> 00:07:29.261\nup to the end and go, gee,\nsorry guys, I overspent by $11,000.\n\n126\n00:07:29.261 --> 00:07:30.950\nHope you're okay with that.\n\n127\n00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.139\nThat's never a good\nsituation to be in [LAUGH].\n\n128\n00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:37.093\n>> No, you're probably gonna get looked\nat with some very dagger stares and\n\n129\n00:07:37.093 --> 00:07:41.392\nthe baseball bats are coming out, and\nthen the door's gonna get closed [LAUGH].\n\n130\n00:07:41.392 --> 00:07:45.216\n>> Yeah, there's not a lot that you have\nthe chance to do that can really help\n\n131\n00:07:45.216 --> 00:07:45.940\nyou out.\n\n132\n00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.069\nBut these formulas are actually\nthings that will help you out,\n\n133\n00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:52.920\neven in the smallest modicum, and\neven in the way that we're doing, right.\n\n134\n00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.171\nJust by talking about,\n\n135\n00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:57.494\nunderstanding the logic of what\nthey show us is kind of the key.\n\n136\n00:07:57.494 --> 00:08:00.709\nBut it's gonna take you actually kind\nof going over some examples, and\n\n137\n00:08:00.709 --> 00:08:03.930\ntaking a look at them and\nactually being able to work them out.\n\n138\n00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:08.020\nMemorize the formulas for the exam,\nthat's really gonna be key for us, okay.\n\n139\n00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.870\nNow, another one that we want to\ntake a look at here, is what we call\n\n140\n00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:16.650\nthe Variance At Completion is what we\nalso are taking a look at here too.\n\n141\n00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:20.810\nNow on the Variance At Completion, this\nis taking two different numbers, right?\n\n142\n00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.646\nOur Budget At Completion and\nthen our Estimate At Completion, and\n\n143\n00:08:24.646 --> 00:08:26.230\nsubtracting them, okay.\n\n144\n00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:29.323\nNow when we start doing something like\nthis what we've actually found out is\n\n145\n00:08:29.323 --> 00:08:32.707\nit actually makes a difference of whether\nit's a positive number versus a negative\n\n146\n00:08:32.707 --> 00:08:34.920\nnumber, that's really what the goal is.\n\n147\n00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.580\nAnd that will actually tell us whether or\nnot we actually need to do more, or\n\n148\n00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.600\ndo less, or whether we're ahead\nof schedule, or behind schedule.\n\n149\n00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.810\nWhether we spent too much, or\n\n150\n00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:45.120\nwhether we're actually good\nin our spending, all that.\n\n151\n00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.240\nWhen we start tracking variance,\n\n152\n00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.080\nit's all about the idea of the efficiency\nof what we're taking a look at here.\n\n153\n00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.840\nAnd so, we wanna make sure\nthat we understand this.\n\n154\n00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.520\nThis really does break down to where we're\nactually comparing our planned values,\n\n155\n00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.010\nwhat we actually budgeted.\n\n156\n00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.390\nVersus what we've actually spent here.\n\n157\n00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.520\nAnd that actually does make sense for us.\n\n158\n00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.090\nHere's what I had planned to spend,\n\n159\n00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.680\nhere is what I've really spent is what\nwe're really getting a look at here, okay?\n\n160\n00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.500\nSo here it is,\nwe are near the end of our project, okay?\n\n161\n00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.460\nYou wanna estimate your project cost,\nyou spend about $71,000.\n\n162\n00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.810\nAnd, you value the project at 70,000 for\nour 93 and\n\n163\n00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:22.374\na half percent work completed,\nyour budget at completion was $75,000.\n\n164\n00:09:22.374 --> 00:09:25.896\nDo you have to work harder or\nnot to try and\n\n165\n00:09:25.896 --> 00:09:29.945\nmeet your Budget At Completion\nat this point?\n\n166\n00:09:29.945 --> 00:09:33.817\nOkay, so what we're actually trying to\ndo is, do I need to speed up stuff?\n\n167\n00:09:33.817 --> 00:09:35.434\nDo I need to add more resources?\n\n168\n00:09:35.434 --> 00:09:40.553\nAnd do I need to actually say, hey,\nI need to pull some contingency reserve\n\n169\n00:09:40.553 --> 00:09:46.340\nto do whatever I need to, to get my budget\nor my project, my budget, both right.\n\n170\n00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.140\nMy project back on track\nthe way it needs to be, or\n\n171\n00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.630\nam I okay just doing what I'm doing?\n\n172\n00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:55.050\nSo that's a lot of stuff that\na simple formula like this\n\n173\n00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.840\ncan help you to determine.\n\n174\n00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.820\nSo here it is, we take our $75,000\nwhich is our Budget At Completion.\n\n175\n00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.650\nAnd let's do the simple figures again.\n\n176\n00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:12.820\nAnd then we subtract out the EAC, which\nwe actually are now saying is $80,000.\n\n177\n00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:13.797\nWhich we have now.\n\n178\n00:10:13.797 --> 00:10:19.542\nAnd now we actually get that negative\nnumber which is the -$5,000,\n\n179\n00:10:21.724 --> 00:10:24.255\nIs what we're actually going to get there,\nokay.\n\n180\n00:10:24.255 --> 00:10:28.780\nSo when we get that negative number,\nnotice that the number is negative.\n\n181\n00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.420\nIt actually means what?\n\n182\n00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:34.820\nI need to work a lot harder if I think\nthat my Budget At Completion is still\n\n183\n00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.095\nwithin goal, okay?\n\n184\n00:10:36.095 --> 00:10:38.860\nCuz I'm varying from that right now.\n\n185\n00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.280\nSo if I know it's a negative number,\n\n186\n00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.060\nit means let me put more resources on it,\nlet me do whatever I need to.\n\n187\n00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.030\nAnd then let's go ahead and\nsee what we can do.\n\n188\n00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:50.410\nIf it's a positive number,\nyou are on track and you don't\n\n189\n00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:54.770\nhave to worry about it, is what you're\nactually seeing when you start doing that.\n\n190\n00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.150\nSo in this instance here, right,\n\n191\n00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.070\nwhen we are taking whether we had the\nBudget At Completion, and then we subtract\n\n192\n00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:05.555\nout our Estimate At Completion, well,\nthat's what we're looking for, right.\n\n193\n00:11:05.555 --> 00:11:08.080\nIs something that actually\nis in the positive.\n\n194\n00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.403\nCuz that actually means that hey, we're\nstill on track to actually do our budget,\n\n195\n00:11:11.403 --> 00:11:14.280\nwe've actually estimated\nthat we're either under or\n\n196\n00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.678\nwe're right there on track as well.\n\n197\n00:11:16.678 --> 00:11:17.870\nSo if everything's actually on track,\n\n198\n00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.962\nyou should end up with a zero,\nis what you should end up with.\n\n199\n00:11:20.962 --> 00:11:25.135\nWhere 75,000 for your Budget At\nCompletion, your estimate at completion is\n\n200\n00:11:25.135 --> 00:11:29.520\n75,000, and that means you have\nactually hit it right on the nail here.\n\n201\n00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.940\nSo there's a lot of these things\nthat we can actually use and\n\n202\n00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.900\nthat actually help us to project into\nthe future just a little bit, right.\n\n203\n00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.217\nAnd sometimes you can actually\ndo this along the way.\n\n204\n00:11:38.217 --> 00:11:41.513\nNow this one is when you feel\nlike you're falling behind, okay.\n\n205\n00:11:41.513 --> 00:11:44.722\nWhen you really feel like,\nman, I'm right there, but\n\n206\n00:11:44.722 --> 00:11:48.561\nI really need to determine do I need\nto push harder right now or not?\n\n207\n00:11:48.561 --> 00:11:51.020\nThis is some of the things you have to do.\n\n208\n00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.140\nYou can look at it from\nother perspectives.\n\n209\n00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.548\nYou can always do performance reports and\neverything,\n\n210\n00:11:56.548 --> 00:11:59.967\ngo man we should be here at this point and\nyou can do that.\n\n211\n00:11:59.967 --> 00:12:01.206\nHere is just a simple one.\n\n212\n00:12:01.206 --> 00:12:07.040\nNow, when you do all these we're not\ntaking a lot of times super detailed data.\n\n213\n00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.300\nIn other words, I could if I wanted to,\n\n214\n00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.690\nbut a lot of times we're just\ntrying to get a round estimate.\n\n215\n00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:16.790\nWe're trying to get round numbers,\nthat I know I need to push harder or\n\n216\n00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:19.580\nI need to stay in my steady course here.\n\n217\n00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.760\nBut can you get detailed?\n\n218\n00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.280\nYeah, I could actually go Daniel,\nI need you to go to everybody who's\n\n219\n00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.790\nactually a team lead right now, and\nI need their figures right now.\n\n220\n00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.990\nAnd I need accurate projections.\n\n221\n00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.340\nI need stuff like that, and I pull\nthat all together and add them all up.\n\n222\n00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.757\nAnd we can make it real detailed and let\nan accountant go through and go, no way,\n\n223\n00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:40.660\nhere's where we need to go and\nhere is what we need to do.\n\n224\n00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:44.590\nBut usually a lot of times its because\nI need to make a decision, right?\n\n225\n00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:49.040\nAm I pulling another crew off of a work\npackage over here to work on this,\n\n226\n00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.570\nbecause it needs to be done right now,\nokay?\n\n227\n00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:52.650\nDo I actually need to do that,\n\n228\n00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.670\nbecause I'm actually spending way\ntoo much money or not enough money.\n\n229\n00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.260\nYou actually can do that as well.\n\n230\n00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:03.230\nSo very good one for us to actually\nbe able to take a look at too, okay?\n\n231\n00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:09.030\nAnd then here's that other one that we\nhave, which we just used inside of that,\n\n232\n00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:14.430\nthe Estimate At Completion here which\nis that the Estimate To Completion.\n\n233\n00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:19.930\nNow, this one, here let me remove\nthat see I did that backward again.\n\n234\n00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.750\nSo when we take a look at\nthis Estimate To Completion,\n\n235\n00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.820\nwe're actually gonna take a look\nat the Estimate At Completion, and\n\n236\n00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:32.290\nwe're simply gonna subtract out what the\nactual amount that we've spent here, okay?\n\n237\n00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.300\nNow when we take a look here,\nyou're near the end of your project,\n\n238\n00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.240\nyou wanna estimate how much\nwork is remaining to be done.\n\n239\n00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:45.540\nYou spent $76,000, your Budget At\nCompletion was 75,000, your EAC is 80,000.\n\n240\n00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:51.121\nSo in this one, you simply take your EAC,\nwhich is your 80,000.\n\n241\n00:13:55.463 --> 00:14:01.314\nAnd then, you subtract out your actual\ncost, which is gonna be 76,000 here.\n\n242\n00:14:04.658 --> 00:14:09.148\nAnd now that means that what we\nhave is now a positive number,\n\n243\n00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:11.183\nwhich is 4000, okay.\n\n244\n00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:14.524\nNow, the good thing is this actually\ndoes tell you as far as your\n\n245\n00:14:14.524 --> 00:14:19.401\nEstimate To Completion here, about $4,000\nfor you to complete the entire project.\n\n246\n00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:23.726\nBut notice it's actually not a negative\nnumber, and that means you're probably\n\n247\n00:14:23.726 --> 00:14:28.360\nright on track here to complete what you\nactually believe is going to happen.\n\n248\n00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.000\nIf it's negative, right, if we actually\ndo end up with a negative number,\n\n249\n00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.420\nwe spent more than what\nwe've estimated here, okay.\n\n250\n00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.270\nThen we definitely need to work\na lot harder at this point,\n\n251\n00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.630\nif we're gonna try and figure this out\nas far as what is actually remaining for\n\n252\n00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:47.260\nus to actually complete all of\nthe work that needs to be done.\n\n253\n00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.980\nSo there's a lot of different formulas\nthat we've gone over in these two\n\n254\n00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.910\nepisodes here, okay,\nthat will help you out.\n\n255\n00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:59.560\nThe good thing for you right,\nis the CompTIA Project+, they really\n\n256\n00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:04.210\nwant you to at least understand when\nyou might actually use these formulas.\n\n257\n00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:07.040\nSo we've gone through different\nscenarios to help us out there.\n\n258\n00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.948\nThey do want you to actually\nknow the formulas themselves.\n\n259\n00:15:09.948 --> 00:15:12.990\nAnd if you're actually getting ready for\nthe exam and you're preparing for\n\n260\n00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:14.540\nthem, work through them.\n\n261\n00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.850\nCome up with your own scenarios and\nplug in some numbers here.\n\n262\n00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.210\nI don't think you're gonna get a lot of\nnumbers that are actually going to be as\n\n263\n00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.330\nlarge as the ones that we've used.\n\n264\n00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.730\nBut I think you will get them as being\nas simple as some of the ones that\n\n265\n00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:26.670\nwe've used.\n\n266\n00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:29.250\nAnd the reason why is that\nbecause you're on a timed exam.\n\n267\n00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:33.040\nAnd they're not going to make you,\nI again can't say that.\n\n268\n00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.060\nI don't believe that what they'll\nactually make you do is try and\n\n269\n00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:40.650\nfigure out some mathematical calculus in\nyour head, to have to write down six or\n\n270\n00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.230\nseven different answers before\nyou can figure this out.\n\n271\n00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.750\nBecause it is a timed exam as well.\n\n272\n00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.210\nBut it means you do have to pay attention,\n\n273\n00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.940\nyou do have to know when you're\nactually going to use these and\n\n274\n00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:54.610\nwhat benefit that they are and\nhow you might actually determine them.\n\n275\n00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.200\nSo make sure you go ahead and\nyou pay attention.\n\n276\n00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.640\nGo back through these episodes,\nand then learn those formulas.\n\n277\n00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.500\n>> That's right.\n\n278\n00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.170\nWell Ronnie, you've taken us through\na lot of really excellent estimations and\n\n279\n00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.160\ncalculations, and\n\n280\n00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.742\nthings that we could use to make sure that\nour projects stay on budget, on time.\n\n281\n00:16:11.742 --> 00:16:14.620\nAnd then if we do go over,\nwe start to see that we're going over,\n\n282\n00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.010\nthat we can maybe start to\nreign that pony back in.\n\n283\n00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.300\nAre there any other calculations,\nestimations,\n\n284\n00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.370\nor cool little tricks that you\nwanna share with us today?\n\n285\n00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:26.200\n>> Not anything that's really gonna\nbe super helpful right now, right?\n\n286\n00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.750\nBecause in project management,\nare they always coming up with more and\n\n287\n00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.080\ndeeper formulas?\n\n288\n00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.870\nYes, you better believe it.\n\n289\n00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.050\nAnd you're also gonna see something\nelse over the period of time.\n\n290\n00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:38.880\nThe longer you're in it,\nthe more that those numbers and\n\n291\n00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.760\nthose values wind up changing.\n\n292\n00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.880\nJust like I showed you were there's\nsomething like b, c, w, s, right?\n\n293\n00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.450\nIt actually changed into something else,\nand\n\n294\n00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.730\nyou'll actually see the same\nthing will happen again.\n\n295\n00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:52.410\nMore than likely in three or four years,\nI don't know I'm not predicting anything.\n\n296\n00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:55.370\nBut I'm pretty much saying that you'll\nprobably see that that terminology\n\n297\n00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:56.500\nwill change again.\n\n298\n00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.330\nThat's why I think it's more key that\nwhatever terminology you're using right\n\n299\n00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:03.530\nnow, the key is that you\nunderstand in your words\n\n300\n00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:06.170\nwhat those values\nactually do bring to you.\n\n301\n00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.420\nAnd make sure you take a look at those\nwordings and those scenarios, and\n\n302\n00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:12.250\ngo, all right, that's the earned\nvalue that they're giving me, that's\n\n303\n00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:16.280\nthe Budget At Completion that they're\ntalking about, that's the actual cost.\n\n304\n00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.400\nSo remember, they're not gonna actually\nexplain it in technical terms sometimes,\n\n305\n00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.470\nthey'll just tell you.\n\n306\n00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.890\nHere's the amount you spent at this point,\nokay.\n\n307\n00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:27.687\nHere's what you actually believe that\nthe project is worth at 95% of the project\n\n308\n00:17:27.687 --> 00:17:30.853\ncompletion, or\nat 17% of the project completion.\n\n309\n00:17:30.853 --> 00:17:34.453\nAnd that means they're\ntrying to say earned value,\n\n310\n00:17:34.453 --> 00:17:38.420\nmake sure you can kind of\nidentify situations like that.\n\n311\n00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:42.340\nBut it's better if you actually do\nopen up, get a study guide out there.\n\n312\n00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.940\nWe do recommend the one\nfrom Sybex out there.\n\n313\n00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.830\nLook through those particular ones\nespecially on these formulas.\n\n314\n00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:49.860\nRead through those scenarios,\n\n315\n00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.600\nmake sure you understand them and\nput them all back together.\n\n316\n00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.742\n>> All right, well Ronny,\nwe surely appreciate your stopping by and\n\n317\n00:17:55.742 --> 00:17:59.406\nimparting the knowledge that's in your\nbrain into ours at least hopefully.\n\n318\n00:17:59.406 --> 00:18:02.377\nThat was the goal of this show,\nhopefully that did happen.\n\n319\n00:18:02.377 --> 00:18:05.360\nWe do thank you guys for\nstopping by and hanging out with us.\n\n320\n00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.840\nWe do hope you learned something,\nbut we've come to the end of yet\n\n321\n00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.420\nagain another great episode, so\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n322\n00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.600\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowie.\n\n323\n00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.278\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n324\n00:18:13.278 --> 00:18:15.098\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n325\n00:18:15.098 --> 00:18:20.634\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.270\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.270\nwe are moving forward\nwith our Project+ series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.560\nJoining us back in the studio again\ntoday to help us in that endeavor\n\n6\n00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.340\nis our good friend and\nour guiding star, Mister Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.570\nRonnie, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n8\n00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.340\n>> Well, thank you for\n\n9\n00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.440\nhaving me back on the show as we do\ncontinue on with Comptia Project+.\n\n10\n00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.970\nAnd we are in the middle of taking a look\nat, of course, one of those phases, right,\n\n11\n00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.140\nthe idea of monitoring and\ncontrolling, and\n\n12\n00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.270\none of the things that we really need to\ndo at this particular point in our project\n\n13\n00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.400\nis to ensure that the information\ncontinues to flow.\n\n14\n00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.300\nThere's a movie that Daniel and\nI love which is a Dune movie, and\n\n15\n00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.290\nwe talk about the spice must flow.\n\n16\n00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:54.120\n>> The spice must flow.\n\n17\n00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.690\n>> And when it doesn't flow,\nright, people get upset and\n\n18\n00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.480\npeople get angry and then the entire\nguilds, they start killing everybody.\n\n19\n00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.090\nWell, in project management,\n\n20\n00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.160\nhopefully it doesn't end in that\nway where people kill each other.\n\n21\n00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.460\nBut when the information doesn't flow,\nokay,\n\n22\n00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.910\nwhen there isn't some system that actually\nallows that to happen, what you will get,\n\n23\n00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.410\nthough, is dissatisfied team members.\n\n24\n00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.190\nYou also get dissatisfied stakeholders,\nand\n\n25\n00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.090\nthe problem is that it comes down to you.\n\n26\n00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.340\nNow, why is that?\n\n27\n00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.915\nIt's that way because you\nare the project manager, and\n\n28\n00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:30.460\nyou're the one that really did plan out\njust about everything on the project, and\n\n29\n00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.970\none of those plans is what we\ncalled the communication plan.\n\n30\n00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.520\nThat communications plan\nthat I'm mentioning,\n\n31\n00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.410\nright, is something that we\ndid take the time to develop,\n\n32\n00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.260\nto actually ensure that we told our\nstakeholders the things that we needed to.\n\n33\n00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.550\nWe found out what method that they really\ndo prefer us to actually communicating\n\n34\n00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.700\nwith them, and actually even talked about\nwhat types of information they need.\n\n35\n00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.750\nSame thing also goes on with our team\nmembers, but we tend to communicate with\n\n36\n00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.270\nour team members a lot easier than with\nthe idea of the stakeholders here.\n\n37\n00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.760\nAnd that can be problematic at times when\neverybody that actually is working on\n\n38\n00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.060\nthe team knows good information,\nbut stakeholders do not.\n\n39\n00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.400\nIt's one of those unusual situations when\nsomebody working on your team now actually\n\n40\n00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.197\nends up talking to a stakeholder outside\nof the project through context and\n\n41\n00:02:16.197 --> 00:02:16.876\nsays, hey.\n\n42\n00:02:16.876 --> 00:02:18.672\nDid you know that we actually\nchanged this on the project?\n\n43\n00:02:18.672 --> 00:02:20.140\nStakeholder goes nope.\n\n44\n00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.680\nDidn't have a clue.\n\n45\n00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.380\nYou normally actually\nfind out something that\n\n46\n00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.250\nthe stakeholder doesn't appreciate\nstuff like that because why?\n\n47\n00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.660\nWell, they actually have a vested interest\nin some way, somehow that project getting\n\n48\n00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.300\ndone, and they would actually appreciate\nwhen they do get the information and\n\n49\n00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.240\nthat they're not learning it from somebody\nelse, but they should be learning it from\n\n50\n00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.800\nyou, and that is the key behind what\nwe're actually taking a look at here.\n\n51\n00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.700\nA lot of times, when we take a look at\nthis, right, it's easy to say, well,\n\n52\n00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.450\nthat's just simple.\n\n53\n00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.000\nWe'll just start emailing everybody.\n\n54\n00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.930\nWe'll start texting everybody.\n\n55\n00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.860\nBut that's not the idea, right?\n\n56\n00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.920\nThe idea is to ensure that\nthe information that we actually\n\n57\n00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.490\ndo have that we need to give out to people\nis gonna be given out according to a plan,\n\n58\n00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.960\nsomething that can be managed, and that\nmeans you have to actually be right in\n\n59\n00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.950\nthe middle of that and understand our\nplan for distributing the information.\n\n60\n00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.520\nNow, what is the entirety of this\n\n61\n00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.560\nabout when we start talking about\nmanaging information distribution?\n\n62\n00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.300\nWell, let's take a look at my computer\nhere, and that will help us out.\n\n63\n00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.568\nSo I've said this phrase just a couple\nof times during another episode here,\n\n64\n00:03:24.568 --> 00:03:27.141\nbut when it breaks down to everything,\nokay?\n\n65\n00:03:27.141 --> 00:03:31.434\nWhen it comes down to anything you have\nto do in terms of communication on your\n\n66\n00:03:31.434 --> 00:03:34.265\nproject, the goal is fairly simple here,\nokay?\n\n67\n00:03:34.265 --> 00:03:39.008\nIt's making sure that we get the right\ninformation to the right people at\n\n68\n00:03:39.008 --> 00:03:40.105\nthe right time.\n\n69\n00:03:40.105 --> 00:03:42.842\nOkay?\nAll three of those elements have to be\n\n70\n00:03:42.842 --> 00:03:46.270\nright, or\nyou actually end up with problems.\n\n71\n00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.291\nSo we take the scenario that I just talked\nabout earlier, here that just a few\n\n72\n00:03:51.291 --> 00:03:56.782\nmoments ago, right, that a team members\nof yours is discussing something outside\n\n73\n00:03:56.782 --> 00:04:01.738\nof the project work day and ends up\ntalking to a stake holder and says, hey.\n\n74\n00:04:01.738 --> 00:04:07.360\nDid you know about the new change we\nactually just implemented on the project?\n\n75\n00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.990\nAnd that other stake holder\ndoesn't actually now about it,\n\n76\n00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.870\nand it's something they should now.\n\n77\n00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.510\nWell, in that instance, right?\n\n78\n00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.070\nThat could be the right information that\nneeded to be related to that stakeholder.\n\n79\n00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.820\nOkay?\n\n80\n00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.930\nIt is related to the stakeholder, but\nthat was not the right time to relay it.\n\n81\n00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.510\nOkay?\n\n82\n00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.760\nAnd it should not have actually\ncome from that particular person.\n\n83\n00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.360\nA change like that, especially if it\nwas a monumental change to the project\n\n84\n00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.460\nProbably should have come from you the\nproject manager more than anything else.\n\n85\n00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.500\nSo when we take a look at this idea,\nwe want to break down just briefly here,\n\n86\n00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.960\njust for a few moments, and then we will\ntalk about why this is actually important.\n\n87\n00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.160\nIf I can actually scroll over here.\n\n88\n00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.340\nThere we go, just a little bit.\n\n89\n00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.810\nLet me see.\nI am kind of getting a,\n\n90\n00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.840\nlet me zoom out just a little bit there.\n\n91\n00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.150\nLet's talk about this idea\nof right information.\n\n92\n00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.901\nRemember that you as a project manager,\nright?\n\n93\n00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:58.705\nAs your project is continuing to progress,\n\n94\n00:04:58.705 --> 00:05:03.113\nyour getting information flowing\ntowards you at all times, right?\n\n95\n00:05:03.113 --> 00:05:04.225\nAs a work package starts,\n\n96\n00:05:04.225 --> 00:05:06.915\nsomebody is probably sending\nyou information saying, look.\n\n97\n00:05:06.915 --> 00:05:08.670\nWe're about to start our project.\n\n98\n00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.210\nAs work packages are finishing,\nyou were getting information saying, hey.\n\n99\n00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.026\nOur work package is finishing.\n\n100\n00:05:14.026 --> 00:05:16.624\nIf something actually gets delayed,\nyou're getting information that, hey.\n\n101\n00:05:16.624 --> 00:05:21.444\nWe had to kinda stop and delay here\nbecause one of our workers got sick or\n\n102\n00:05:21.444 --> 00:05:24.793\nill right there, so\nwe have to kinda stop, and so\n\n103\n00:05:24.793 --> 00:05:29.387\nyou're actually constantly getting\ninformation coming at you.\n\n104\n00:05:29.387 --> 00:05:33.212\nWell, those information are generally\ncoming in from reports from our project\n\n105\n00:05:33.212 --> 00:05:38.130\nteams, and that means you actually getting\na lot of real time and live information.\n\n106\n00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.270\nAlso, because of the way\nthat you're monitoring it,\n\n107\n00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.330\nwhether I should getting some automated\ninformation or change request or\n\n108\n00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.450\nwhatever it is here,\nyou have this ability, right?\n\n109\n00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.690\nThat a ton of information\nthat you're hands here, and\n\n110\n00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:54.320\nyou have at decision to make at this\npoint in terms of right information.\n\n111\n00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.973\nYou can be very stingy with\nthat information, okay?\n\n112\n00:05:56.973 --> 00:05:59.954\nYou can say, hey,\nI'm gonna gather all this up, and\n\n113\n00:05:59.954 --> 00:06:02.811\nI'll actually just not\ngive enough information.\n\n114\n00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:06.970\nWhen you do something like that to your\nstakeholders, they feel left out, okay?\n\n115\n00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.630\nThey don't understand what's\ngoing on in your project.\n\n116\n00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.780\nThey actually have no clue of why stuff\nis being done the way it's being done.\n\n117\n00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.380\nYou're essentially just giving\nthem a dearth of information, and\n\n118\n00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.510\nwhen that happens, they are guessing and\nthat actual guessing here,\n\n119\n00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.210\nactually leads to speculation,\nand what is speculation based on?\n\n120\n00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.740\nNothing. Okay? And that means that at this\npoint, you have to actually kinda justify,\n\n121\n00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.450\nand they actually justify in their mind\nwhy they're speculating the way that they\n\n122\n00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.550\nare, so too little information\nis you can give to them\n\n123\n00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.780\nis absolutely going to actually kind of\nnot get you the results that you want, so\n\n124\n00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.590\nyou need to give them the right\namount of information that they need\n\n125\n00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.460\nat that particular point in time,\nand we'll see that too.\n\n126\n00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.400\nYou give them too much,\nwe talked about information overload,\n\n127\n00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.150\nand I think Daniel's actually\nmentioned in our show as well that\n\n128\n00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.580\nwe try to break it down to\nabout 30 minute chunks so\n\n129\n00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.810\nthat we don't give information overload,\nand you're like, my gosh.\n\n130\n00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.475\nRonnie can continue on for 45 minutes,\nand then they're like yeah he can.\n\n131\n00:06:57.475 --> 00:06:59.244\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He's over there just shaking his head\n\n132\n00:06:59.244 --> 00:07:00.893\nviolently like yeah, he can do that.\n\n133\n00:07:00.893 --> 00:07:04.833\nBut we try to, I don't say that I\ndon't go that long sometimes, but\n\n134\n00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:08.981\nthe very fact is if I just spew out\ninformation to a stakeholder and now,\n\n135\n00:07:08.981 --> 00:07:10.729\nthey have to sift through it.\n\n136\n00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:12.789\nThey kind of get a little bit\nangry because they're like,\n\n137\n00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:14.940\nI'm really looking for\na specific piece of information.\n\n138\n00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.760\n>> Yeah, Ronnie.\nOne of my favorite little sayings is it's\n\n139\n00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:21.910\nlike drinking from a fire hose because it\nreally illustrates that specific point.\n\n140\n00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.630\nIt's information overload.\n\n141\n00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.161\nI cannot take in all that\ninformation at one given time.\n\n142\n00:07:27.161 --> 00:07:29.260\nHold it, like my friend Brad likes to say.\n\n143\n00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.570\nHold up, swolled up.\n\n144\n00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.700\nYou're going a little too hard,\na little too strong, a little too fast.\n\n145\n00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.407\nWhy don't you break it down into more\nmanageable bites of information that I can\n\n146\n00:07:37.407 --> 00:07:39.285\ntake in, assimilate, roll it around,\n\n147\n00:07:39.285 --> 00:07:42.077\nthink about it, and now,\nyou can give me a little bit more.\n\n148\n00:07:42.077 --> 00:07:45.071\nIf you just start throwing everything\nin the kitchen sink at them,\n\n149\n00:07:45.071 --> 00:07:48.069\ntheir eyes are gonna glaze over,\nand they're gonna go, yeah.\n\n150\n00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:50.882\nYeah, that sounds great, and\nthen one day, they're gonna,\n\n151\n00:07:50.882 --> 00:07:52.617\nhow come you never told me about this?\n\n152\n00:07:52.617 --> 00:07:53.526\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, I did.\n\n153\n00:07:53.526 --> 00:07:56.891\nIt was in that three hour meeting I sat\nyou in, and you never got to say a word or\n\n154\n00:07:56.891 --> 00:07:57.692\nhave a question.\n\n155\n00:07:57.692 --> 00:07:59.294\nI just blasted you with info.\n\n156\n00:07:59.294 --> 00:08:00.540\nThat's exactly what we're talking about.\n\n157\n00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.453\nWe want to avoid those\ntypes of situations.\n\n158\n00:08:02.453 --> 00:08:03.223\n>> You really do.\n\n159\n00:08:03.223 --> 00:08:06.968\nYou wanna make sure that doesn't happen,\nso you have to actually take a look at all\n\n160\n00:08:06.968 --> 00:08:09.590\nof the information that you are giving and\nbe wise about.\n\n161\n00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.730\nAnd that's you figure out how much of\nthat information you're distributing.\n\n162\n00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.520\nThe other thing of course is\nthe right people as well, right?\n\n163\n00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.740\nSo, remember that everybody needs\nevery single piece of information.\n\n164\n00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.970\nSo you wanna make sure that you're\nactually providing the relevant\n\n165\n00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.400\ninformation that the people\nare actually needing.\n\n166\n00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.370\nSometimes you may actually get into\na meeting with a whole group of people\n\n167\n00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.260\nin which part of them are actually on\nthe project team and some of them aren't.\n\n168\n00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.500\nThe very fact is something like this\ncan actually end up happening and\n\n169\n00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.260\nmay actually reveal more\ninformation than you need to.\n\n170\n00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.690\nSo make sure you actually have the right\ngroup of people in hand instead.\n\n171\n00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:43.970\nAnd that actually depends on you.\n\n172\n00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.020\nIf you actually interacting\nwith your stakeholders and\n\n173\n00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:50.720\nwith your team members you know who need\ncertain information and who doesn't.\n\n174\n00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.140\nIt's when you just walk into a room and\n\n175\n00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.360\nyou go,\nyou wanna know what I just dealt with?\n\n176\n00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.640\nAnd now all of the sudden it's people\nthat you didn't wanna hear that.\n\n177\n00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.950\nAnd that does happen at time and\nnow you don't have to apologize sometimes,\n\n178\n00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.760\nsometimes you may have to but\n\n179\n00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.920\nyou again aren't actually being wise\nwho you're giving this information to.\n\n180\n00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.270\nSo just kinda be aware and\nlastly of course the right timing.\n\n181\n00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.480\nWe're gonna talk about that idea\nthe timing issue but remember not\n\n182\n00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.300\nevery single piece of information\nthat comes to you is an emergency and\n\n183\n00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.930\nthat's the same thing you want to make\nsure that you relay to your stakeholders.\n\n184\n00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.280\nNot everything that changes,\n\n185\n00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.300\nnot everything's that's there,\nis an emergency.\n\n186\n00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.860\nYou want to make sure that if it was\nan emergency, you let them know.\n\n187\n00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.890\nBut it's actually timing on certain things\nthat you actually let them know that it's\n\n188\n00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:36.430\nperiodic that you'll be\ngiving them updates, or.\n\n189\n00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.350\nIf you need me call me,\nif it's an emergency make sure that\n\n190\n00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:44.070\nyou have that open line of communication\nand that does the right time for them too.\n\n191\n00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.870\nSo you might be wanna like why is all this\nimportant that we actually do this okay.\n\n192\n00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.960\nAnd the reason why is\nbecause if you don't do this,\n\n193\n00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.960\nif you don't actually open up this\ninformation distribution plan and\n\n194\n00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.760\nmake sure that it's actually well\nplanned and done the way we want to.\n\n195\n00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.510\nYou're not managing your stakeholder's\nexpectations, and when you don't do that,\n\n196\n00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:08.510\nyou're gonna find yourself in a worse\ncondition than you think you are.\n\n197\n00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.180\nOkay?\n\n198\n00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.230\nStakeholders can make or\nbreak your project.\n\n199\n00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.830\nOkay?\n\n200\n00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.910\nThey want you to succeed at the beginning.\n\n201\n00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:18.070\nYou don't have the information and\nthe need when it's actually required,\n\n202\n00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:21.740\nthen they can actually work against you,\nand that's something you don't want to do.\n\n203\n00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.690\nSo you actually opening up\nthe lines of communication and\n\n204\n00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.950\nbeing able to distribute the information\nthe way that you want, you manage those\n\n205\n00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:33.710\nstakeholder expectations in very real\nways, is what we want to take a look at.\n\n206\n00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:37.030\nSo there's four different methods that\nwe can actually find inside of our\n\n207\n00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:42.090\ndistribution plan that is really gonna\nhelp us to manage that idea of stakeholder\n\n208\n00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.260\nexpectations.\n\n209\n00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.910\nThe first and foremost one is kind of the\none that we've been focusing in on here\n\n210\n00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.680\nwhich is to actually manage\nthe communication process with\n\n211\n00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.640\nthe stakeholders there are certain things\nthat should only come through you.\n\n212\n00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.250\nOkay.\n\n213\n00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.610\nAnd that's what you need to\nlet your stakeholders know.\n\n214\n00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:02.190\nIf there are complete project changes,\nlet's say to the scope, you tell your\n\n215\n00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:06.510\nstakeholders that that information\nshould come from you; in a signed way,\n\n216\n00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:08.630\nin a particular voice message,\n\n217\n00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:12.250\nor whatever it might be that\nyou go ahead and do this, okay.\n\n218\n00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:16.130\nYou wanna make sure that you actually do\nfollow whatever that preferred method\n\n219\n00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.460\nis according to your distribution plan.\n\n220\n00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.050\nAnd make sure it's actually that way\nbecause that now becomes an official\n\n221\n00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.760\nmethod of communication.\n\n222\n00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.050\nIf they actually receive\nit in any other way,\n\n223\n00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.380\nDaniel whispers it in their\near over the water cooler or\n\n224\n00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:33.100\nyou hear about it in a meeting,\nin a so-called called meeting here that,\n\n225\n00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:37.430\nthat may actually happen, but the very\nfact is it may not be true at all.\n\n226\n00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.680\nSo, you want to make sure\nthat they understand that.\n\n227\n00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.661\nThat there is sometimes information\nthat floats around that isn't\n\n228\n00:11:42.661 --> 00:11:43.880\naccurate.information.\n\n229\n00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.250\n>> Yeah, in the military they\ncall that a left end run.\n\n230\n00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:49.720\nYou're basically circumventing, or\ngoing around the chain of command.\n\n231\n00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.710\nThere's a proper chain and distribution\nof information that has to go to.\n\n232\n00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.990\nIf you wanna make a request, or if you\nneed to tell something about something,\n\n233\n00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.740\nyou have a chain of\ncommand which you follow.\n\n234\n00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.510\nThis is the same basic idea.\n\n235\n00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:04.360\nIf Ronnie is my project manager, and\nI need to tell something to a stakeholder,\n\n236\n00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.020\nor make information available for\nthem, I tell Ronnie.\n\n237\n00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.440\nI don't go and tell the stakeholder.\n\n238\n00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.030\nThat's not my place, that's not my job.\n\n239\n00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.260\nThat's Ronnie's job.\n\n240\n00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.500\nAs the project manager.\n\n241\n00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.240\nHe is the liaison between the stakeholders\nand the people working the project.\n\n242\n00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.530\nI would tell Ronnie that information,\nhe would formalize in such a way that it\n\n243\n00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.690\nwould make sense to them,\nthey would understand what's going on.\n\n244\n00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:26.940\nMaybe I'm a technician, maybe I'm\nan engineer, they don't speak engineered.\n\n245\n00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.330\nAnd I'm gonna off with engineer speak and\n\n246\n00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.450\nlingo, they're not gonna\nunderstand a thing.\n\n247\n00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.320\nRonnie understands it, and he understands\nthe way they think, so he's gonna be\n\n248\n00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.730\nthe best person to do that job and\njust send that information forward.\n\n249\n00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:40.900\nNow, does that mean that it\nalways works out the best way?\n\n250\n00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:44.080\nNo.\nYou have people that want to control\n\n251\n00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:50.020\na situation to their best advantage, and\nthat's understandable in the certain way.\n\n252\n00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:53.380\nBut every now and then left hand\nwins do happen because of that.\n\n253\n00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:57.040\nBut in a perfect world, what we're telling\nyou, that's the way it should work.\n\n254\n00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.200\nI send the information to Ronnie.\n\n255\n00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.720\nRonnie formulates it in a way\nthat they can understand it and\n\n256\n00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.970\nhe bumps it up the chain.\n\n257\n00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.450\n>> That's exactly what we need to\ndo because without that, right,\n\n258\n00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.080\nwe don't have a management process.\n\n259\n00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.460\nI can then go to Daniel, and\nif Daniel then sits there and goes, well,\n\n260\n00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.660\nI didn't say that.\n\n261\n00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.250\nWell, how do I actually\nprove that he said that?\n\n262\n00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:15.340\nI can sit there and go, well Daniel\ntold people he heard you say that.\n\n263\n00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.300\nAnd you can say, I didn't say that.\n\n264\n00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.060\nNobody wrote it down.\n\n265\n00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.490\nNo, I didn't say that.\n\n266\n00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:23.050\nSo what you want is some way that actually\nsays here is what was actually said,\n\n267\n00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.070\nhere's what's actually official.\n\n268\n00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.830\nAnd this also helps you in\nsituations like that, because if it\n\n269\n00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.810\nis a written statement of some sort\nthat you're actually dealing with.\n\n270\n00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:35.380\nThe very fact is you can now go,\nall right here's the official plan,\n\n271\n00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.720\nhere's what needs to be communicated.\n\n272\n00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.960\nAnybody who has any disagreement on it you\nbetter come and see me about it now, okay.\n\n273\n00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.650\nNow the other thing that you also wanna\ndeal with in terms of your stakeholders\n\n274\n00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:48.500\nand senate expectations is how you\ndirectly communicate with them.\n\n275\n00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.690\nA lot of times, they are looking for\ninformation and\n\n276\n00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.670\nwhat you need to know is what\ninformation they're looking for, and\n\n277\n00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.490\nthis means you being\nwilling to ask questions.\n\n278\n00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.740\nI know that there's a lot of times where\nthere's an assumption that goes on.\n\n279\n00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.410\nI just assume that these stakeholders\nunderstand what's actually going on on\n\n280\n00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:07.010\nthe project, and then when they\nask me information, I'm like yeah.\n\n281\n00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.240\nThat just seems logical to me.\n\n282\n00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.100\nIt didn't seem logical to them.\n\n283\n00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.760\nSo, if you need to,\nmake sure you ask questions and\n\n284\n00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.710\nsay what information would\nyou like me to provide?\n\n285\n00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:19.730\nAnd when you do that,\nmake sure you provide that information,\n\n286\n00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.810\nnot a ton of extraneous\ndetails need to go into that.\n\n287\n00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:27.300\nBut, if they ask you a question, provide\na direct answer at that point as well.\n\n288\n00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.160\nIf this is supposed to be\na project status meeting update,\n\n289\n00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.320\nmake sure you actually\nupdate about the status.\n\n290\n00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.170\nIt's very easy for\n\n291\n00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.880\nproject meetings to essentially denigrate\ninto, did you see the game last night?\n\n292\n00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.900\nAnd I'm not saying that those aren't\ngreat things to talk about, but\n\n293\n00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.650\nthe very fact is your time is valuable and\ntheir time is valuable.\n\n294\n00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.750\nMake sure you answer questions directly.\n\n295\n00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.920\nMake sure you actually keep it on\npoint the way that you want to.\n\n296\n00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.190\nAnd there's just some type of\nregular type of meeting, right?\n\n297\n00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.170\nMake sure you actually\nkeep it that way and\n\n298\n00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.680\nkeep to your boundaries\nthat you actually set.\n\n299\n00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.530\nIf it's a 30 minute meeting\nmake sure you do that as well.\n\n300\n00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.570\nDon't sit there and\nhave a 30 minute meeting and then and\n\n301\n00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.260\nhour and a half later you're\nwondering why you're still there and\n\n302\n00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.950\nanybody else is wondering\nwhy they're still there.\n\n303\n00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:05.650\nOkay?\n\n304\n00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:10.410\nAlso, my last point here in terms of\nmanaging the communications here is do not\n\n305\n00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:15.540\nemphasize or do not over emphasize what\ndoesn't need to be over emphasized.\n\n306\n00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.370\nDon't make everything into an emergency.\n\n307\n00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:19.380\nDon't make everything into\nan urgency when it's not,\n\n308\n00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:24.010\nwhen you are asking them to consider\nsomething, give them some idea that,\n\n309\n00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:29.110\nhey this is on this priority list here and\nnot up here.\n\n310\n00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:32.670\nSo it brings me back to a scene\nin a movie on Apollo 13,\n\n311\n00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:35.640\nis when somebody's actually\nworried about this.\n\n312\n00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.829\nAnd Captain says goes, look,\nwe're on step eight, and\n\n313\n00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:43.940\nwhat you're talking about is step 5,042 or\nwhatever it is.\n\n314\n00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.770\nAnd that actually shows you like\nthis guy's worried about 5, 042.\n\n315\n00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:51.736\nJack's saying, hey, let's worry about step\nnine [LAUGH] is what we're talking about\n\n316\n00:15:51.736 --> 00:15:53.214\nhere and the same thing goes on.\n\n317\n00:15:53.214 --> 00:15:56.619\nIt's easy to bring up every single little\ndetail because you're not sure what\n\n318\n00:15:56.619 --> 00:15:57.764\nyou should communicate.\n\n319\n00:15:57.764 --> 00:16:01.494\nBut bring up the priorities, okay, and\nthen remember, don't treat everything as\n\n320\n00:16:01.494 --> 00:16:04.780\nan emergency unless everything\nyou're telling them is an emergency.\n\n321\n00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.111\n>> That's right, keep the main\nthing the main thing as well.\n\n322\n00:16:07.111 --> 00:16:08.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don't get sidetracked.\n\n323\n00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.830\nStay on course and that's gonna help\nthe communication flow a whole lot better.\n\n324\n00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:14.150\nAnd then everybody's gonna\nbe on the same page.\n\n325\n00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.840\nJust like Ronnie said,\n\n326\n00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:19.630\na lot of times these meetings can\ndissolve down into just a hang out.\n\n327\n00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.810\nBut what's the purpose of them\nif information isn't flowing and\n\n328\n00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:25.060\nbeing transmitted from\none person to the other?\n\n329\n00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.490\nSo we gotta stay on point\nwhen it comes to that stuff.\n\n330\n00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:31.130\n>> Yeah, the other thing that we also need\nto do here as we're trying to manage our\n\n331\n00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:32.676\nstakeholders' expectations,\n\n332\n00:16:32.676 --> 00:16:36.770\nis how we tend to deal with issues\nthat actually do arise on our project.\n\n333\n00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:40.694\nThe very fact is, a lot of us are great\nat avoidance more than anything else.\n\n334\n00:16:40.694 --> 00:16:45.740\nSo when issues arise that are a little bit\nnegative, we may try and suppress them.\n\n335\n00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.950\nWe may try and actually just go,\nI'll deal with that later.\n\n336\n00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.480\nAnd when you do that,\nthey end up stacking up.\n\n337\n00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.920\nAnd this idea of issues stacking\nup is never a good thing because\n\n338\n00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.420\nthey will come to a head,\nin this way, right?\n\n339\n00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.950\nThe very fact you haven't addressed\nit means somebody is gonna\n\n340\n00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.120\naddress it for you.\n\n341\n00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:05.828\nIt just ends up happening, especially when\nyou're under a time crunch, money crunch,\n\n342\n00:17:05.828 --> 00:17:09.488\nand a scope crunch, a requirement\nsort of crunch that you deal with.\n\n343\n00:17:09.488 --> 00:17:11.031\nAnd when you have that, right,\n\n344\n00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:15.060\nthat's something that's actually\ngoing to end up reflecting on you.\n\n345\n00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:18.320\nSo one of the things that really\nhelps manage stakeholder meetings, or\n\n346\n00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:23.220\nstakeholder perspective,\nwhat did I say, satisfaction.\n\n347\n00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:25.360\nI couldn't remember what I\nwas meaning to say there.\n\n348\n00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.080\nSatisfaction, is when you\ntake the time to try and\n\n349\n00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.470\nresolve the issues that\narise in a timely manner.\n\n350\n00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:32.290\nNow that's key.\n\n351\n00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:33.210\nLet's go ahead and take a look here,\n\n352\n00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:36.320\nand I've put up three bullet points for\nus to help us out, okay.\n\n353\n00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.640\nSo you don't wanna allow issues to stack\nup because that actually just shows\n\n354\n00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.780\nsomething about you that you're not\nwilling to deal with the issue.\n\n355\n00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.510\nNot a great thing, okay.\n\n356\n00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.515\nSo you deal with them.\n\n357\n00:17:45.515 --> 00:17:47.800\nThat doesn't mean you have to\ndeal with them in rapid fire, but\n\n358\n00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.910\nyou need to show progress in\ndealing with issues that do arise.\n\n359\n00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:52.880\nAnd it needs to be done\nin a timely manner.\n\n360\n00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.630\nDon't sit there and say, I think we'll\ndeal with that six months from now.\n\n361\n00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.250\nGo ahead and deal with them cuz they\nwanna actually know you have an action\n\n362\n00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.290\nplan for this.\n\n363\n00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:03.250\nMake time to resolve and not avoid, okay.\n\n364\n00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:07.525\nMost of us, and we've said this\nbefore about certain people like,\n\n365\n00:18:07.525 --> 00:18:11.733\nthat guy can find 62 ways so\nthat he doesn't have to do one thing.\n\n366\n00:18:11.733 --> 00:18:14.400\nAnd it would only have taken him\ntwo minutes to do that one thing.\n\n367\n00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.218\n>> If he worked as hard at avoiding work-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n368\n00:18:16.218 --> 00:18:16.878\n>> As he does, or\n\n369\n00:18:16.878 --> 00:18:19.573\nif he worked as hard at doing\nwork as he does avoiding work,\n\n370\n00:18:19.573 --> 00:18:21.068\nhe'd be a master at this thing.\n\n371\n00:18:21.068 --> 00:18:24.300\n>> Yeah, and that's something that we\ndon't want to actually see, right.\n\n372\n00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.580\nThe very fact that we keep\nsaying we'll deal with it later,\n\n373\n00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.470\nwe'll deal with it later, guess what?\n\n374\n00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:29.970\nStakeholders are not impressed.\n\n375\n00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.050\nStakeholders are not impressed,\n\n376\n00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:34.490\nteam members are not impressed when\nyou say I'll deal with it later.\n\n377\n00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:37.840\nAnd what happens, you don't deal with\nit later, you simply are avoiding it.\n\n378\n00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.090\nIn your way, that is a deal, but in their\nway it's not really resolving an issue so\n\n379\n00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:43.080\nthat they can move forward.\n\n380\n00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.340\n>> Just rug sweeping basically,\nat that point.\n\n381\n00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.820\n>> That's all it's doing, okay.\n\n382\n00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:49.190\nYou do want to make sure you communicate\nthe resolution that you're actually doing\n\n383\n00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:50.260\nin this too.\n\n384\n00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.115\nNow, it's not the idea of\na bragging session, per se.\n\n385\n00:18:53.115 --> 00:18:56.820\nSaying, yes, you know,\nhere's the issue that I solved today.\n\n386\n00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.320\nThat's not the goal, right.\n\n387\n00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:03.040\nThe goal is to, what,\nactually send a message of confidence that\n\n388\n00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.070\nyour stakeholders can trust\nyou to deal with the issues.\n\n389\n00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:07.710\nOkay, that's what you're trying to do.\n\n390\n00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:12.010\nSo if you can do that, you are satisfying\nyour stakeholders' expectations that hey,\n\n391\n00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.810\nDaniel Lowrie is the project\nmanager in charge.\n\n392\n00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:17.280\nAnd he can deal with issues\nthat actually arise.\n\n393\n00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:17.860\nWell imagine that,\n\n394\n00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.640\ndon't you feel more confidence in that\nthan having somebody like Ronnie that\n\n395\n00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.840\nsays, I think I'll deal with it next\nweek cuz I'm going on vacation.\n\n396\n00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:28.670\nI might as well just take the, I'll deal\nwith that when I get back from vacation.\n\n397\n00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.380\nIt doesn't really inspire confidence,\n\n398\n00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.570\nespecially when people are waiting for\na resolution on the issue.\n\n399\n00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:38.030\nSo that's one of the ways that you\ncan really end up managing that idea\n\n400\n00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:42.360\nof expectation as well, okay?\n\n401\n00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:46.880\nAlso, we want to take a look at\nthe idea of change request, right,\n\n402\n00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.390\nthe requested changes that are made, okay?\n\n403\n00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:50.794\nThis is something else that can happen,\nright.\n\n404\n00:19:50.794 --> 00:19:53.567\nIt goes through the process,\nwe do everything possible,\n\n405\n00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:55.335\nchange board approves everything.\n\n406\n00:19:55.335 --> 00:20:00.816\nAnd then we go, yeah, I just don't see\nwhy we have to do it right now, okay.\n\n407\n00:20:00.816 --> 00:20:04.218\nAnd don't get me wrong, you may find\nout that you don't have to deal with it\n\n408\n00:20:04.218 --> 00:20:06.333\nimmediately, but\nyou do need to deal with it.\n\n409\n00:20:06.333 --> 00:20:09.575\nYou do need to take each one of those\nchange requests seriously because that\n\n410\n00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:11.634\nmeans somebody took\nthe time to deal with what,\n\n411\n00:20:11.634 --> 00:20:13.750\nthe fact that it needed to be approved.\n\n412\n00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:16.944\nSo make sure that your approved\nchanges are implemented, okay,\n\n413\n00:20:16.944 --> 00:20:18.730\nis what you wanna do.\n\n414\n00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:21.660\nNow in that, that means you at the end,\nyou go in and verify, and\n\n415\n00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.170\nyou talk to the people and\ngo, did this change get made?\n\n416\n00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.600\nBecause people are going to ask.\n\n417\n00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.944\nAnd if you go, well, it was approved,\nboy, is that an answer I hate.\n\n418\n00:20:31.944 --> 00:20:35.511\nWhen I say, did this get done, and Daniel\ncomes back to me and goes, well yeah,\n\n419\n00:20:35.511 --> 00:20:36.760\nyou approved it.\n\n420\n00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:41.454\nWell, that didn't answer what I'm looking\nfor so I know whether or not it got done.\n\n421\n00:20:41.454 --> 00:20:44.228\nAnd then he goes, no yeah,\nyou approved it, but\n\n422\n00:20:44.228 --> 00:20:46.407\nI can't tell you if it got done or not.\n\n423\n00:20:46.407 --> 00:20:50.610\nI mean that, all of a sudden the top\njust blows off and there it is,\n\n424\n00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.910\nit becomes a cartoon at that point.\n\n425\n00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.130\nThe other thing, let's go and\ntake a look here,\n\n426\n00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.170\nis you've gotta actually realize\nsomething on these change requests.\n\n427\n00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:02.260\nNot everything's personal,\neven if it's change you don't like, okay?\n\n428\n00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:06.090\nSometimes, and we use this phrase around\nhere, Face Challenges with Optimism.\n\n429\n00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:11.207\nIt's actually part of our mottoes and\nour goals that we have here at ITProTV.\n\n430\n00:21:11.207 --> 00:21:12.140\nThe very fact is,\n\n431\n00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:16.452\nsometimes these are changes that you may\nhave not really thought were necessary.\n\n432\n00:21:16.452 --> 00:21:17.479\nBut when it came down to it,\n\n433\n00:21:17.479 --> 00:21:20.110\nit was approved because somebody\ndid think it was necessary.\n\n434\n00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.130\nAnd you might take that personally, okay?\n\n435\n00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:26.170\nSo you do have to actually go and\novercome that, and\n\n436\n00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.040\nface that particular\nchallenge with optimism,\n\n437\n00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:32.550\nsaying, I know this is better for\nthe entire project if I do this.\n\n438\n00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.340\nIt's easy to look down on it,\nand when you do that, and\n\n439\n00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.600\nthen when you actually bring that\nnegativity to it, whoever you're actually\n\n440\n00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.860\nassigning that change is also\ngonna look at it with negativity.\n\n441\n00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.770\nAnd that won't get your\nproject done any better.\n\n442\n00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:49.610\nIt doesn't inspire the confidence or help\nthe stakeholders have a better expectation\n\n443\n00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:51.970\nat what can come from your\nproject as well, okay?\n\n444\n00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:54.115\nSo remember that it's\nnot always about you,\n\n445\n00:21:54.115 --> 00:21:56.440\neven though we're talking about you,\nha-ha.\n\n446\n00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.260\n>> [LAUGH] That's just the way it goes.\n\n447\n00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.931\n>> Okay, and then finally here,\n\n448\n00:21:59.931 --> 00:22:03.870\nokay, we wanna make sure that our\nstakeholders understand something.\n\n449\n00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:07.440\nThat they have concerns,\nokay, no matter what.\n\n450\n00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.010\nBut we wanna actually let\nthem know that we can\n\n451\n00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:13.430\nmanage these particular types\nof concerns proactively.\n\n452\n00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:17.980\nIn other words, we're anticipating,\nthat we see these concerns coming up.\n\n453\n00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.660\nIf the stakeholder says,\nI didn't even think about that.\n\n454\n00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.530\nAnd that stakeholder\nover there's been saying,\n\n455\n00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:26.810\nI've been trying to communicate this to\nyou that I thought this was gonna happen.\n\n456\n00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:29.990\nAnd you never took the hint, Ronnie, okay?\n\n457\n00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:31.180\nWell, why didn't I?\n\n458\n00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.299\nWell, it's because I didn't\ntake the time to even ask.\n\n459\n00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.700\nWhen I do my project status meetings and\neverything else,\n\n460\n00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.890\nI should have at the end there at least\none question that says, are there any\n\n461\n00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:45.910\nconcerns that we need to actually address\nfrom anything I've talked about, okay?\n\n462\n00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.100\nAsk about the concerns\nof the stakeholders.\n\n463\n00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.470\nIf you go,\nI didn't know you had that concern Daniel.\n\n464\n00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:54.870\nAnd Daniel's saying,\nwell, you never asked.\n\n465\n00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:56.896\nThat's true, so both sides are wrong.\n\n466\n00:22:56.896 --> 00:23:00.047\nBut if I'm the project manager,\nI should be proactive in this and\n\n467\n00:23:00.047 --> 00:23:02.620\nactually figure out what's going on here.\n\n468\n00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:06.840\nAnd then you do your best to address\nthat issue that you have in line here.\n\n469\n00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.901\nSo being able to do all this\nstuff is really all about that.\n\n470\n00:23:10.901 --> 00:23:15.246\nIs making sure that we can\nend up helping out the way\n\n471\n00:23:15.246 --> 00:23:19.080\nthat our stakeholders expect us to be.\n\n472\n00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:24.292\nAnd when we do stuff like that, it really\ndoes add in some solid collateral,\n\n473\n00:23:24.292 --> 00:23:29.990\nbuy-ins for your stakeholders that will\nreally help your project move along.\n\n474\n00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.080\nWhen you do satisfy your\nstakeholders' expectations,\n\n475\n00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:37.260\nit's easier to get a little\nbit more requests in, right?\n\n476\n00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:41.700\nIt's easier to say I need another 10,000,\nno, it's probably not that easy.\n\n477\n00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.213\n[LAUGH]\n>> I believe the technical term for\n\n478\n00:23:43.213 --> 00:23:44.470\nthis is called schmoozing.\n\n479\n00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:44.983\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right,\n\n480\n00:23:44.983 --> 00:23:48.063\nand we're having a little fun there,\nbut that's exactly right.\n\n481\n00:23:48.063 --> 00:23:50.394\nYou want to have them on your side.\n\n482\n00:23:50.394 --> 00:23:52.113\nBecause what if you need more money?\n\n483\n00:23:52.113 --> 00:23:55.163\nWell they're the people, most likely,\nthat are funding the project.\n\n484\n00:23:55.163 --> 00:23:56.357\nThey are the stakeholders.\n\n485\n00:23:56.357 --> 00:23:59.469\nThey're the ones that are invested,\nnot only with their time and\n\n486\n00:23:59.469 --> 00:24:03.810\nprobably their reputation, but the actual\ndollar bills sitting in their wallet.\n\n487\n00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:07.050\nSo if you need more of that, or if you\nneed maybe some changes approved and\n\n488\n00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:10.680\nyou know that if I go to this particular\nstakeholder who I have a really good\n\n489\n00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.500\nworking relationship with, I always try\nto address every problem that they have.\n\n490\n00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.170\nThat I'm probably gong to have a better\ntime to get that happening cuz\n\n491\n00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:18.900\nthey're gonna listen to me.\n\n492\n00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.960\nThey're gonna trust that\nwhat I have to say and\n\n493\n00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:26.200\nthe changes I want to make is a benefit\nfor the project and ultimately it's gonna\n\n494\n00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:30.225\nbenefit them, and monetarily,\nthat's always a good one, right?\n\n495\n00:24:30.225 --> 00:24:31.110\nAnd that's what they're gonna think.\n\n496\n00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:32.570\nSo they're gonna help you out.\n\n497\n00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:36.244\nIf they think, man this guy never listens\nto me, [LAUGH] he never does anything and\n\n498\n00:24:36.244 --> 00:24:39.377\nhe just kind of comes by and says,\nyeah, project's moving along and\n\n499\n00:24:39.377 --> 00:24:41.380\nit was good to see you guys again.\n\n500\n00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:44.130\nAnd I'm like, wow,\nnothing's happening here.\n\n501\n00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:45.510\nI get no information.\n\n502\n00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:49.310\nThey're gonna be really skeptical\nabout approving any changes because\n\n503\n00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:50.690\nthey don't know what's happening.\n\n504\n00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:51.410\nThey're in the dark.\n\n505\n00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:55.510\nYou had to keep them in there, keep them\nclose to the vest, you invest in them and\n\n506\n00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:57.720\nthey'll invest in you and\nthat's the way you gotta come at it.\n\n507\n00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.670\nThere is no doubt that all it\nreally does help in managing\n\n508\n00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.720\nthose stakeholder expectations\nare really key, right?\n\n509\n00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.840\nBecause of the issues that\nwe will end up arising\n\n510\n00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.800\njust when progress ends up happening.\n\n511\n00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.320\nNow, there's two other issues\nthat we want to address just\n\n512\n00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.570\nbriefly here as well, okay?\n\n513\n00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.560\nOne, is if you tend to actually\nlike to do the communication,\n\n514\n00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.770\nthe majority of your communication\nthrough meetings, it's perfectly fine.\n\n515\n00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:22.640\nThe recommendation, though,\nis that you use an agenda.\n\n516\n00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.080\nDo not just go, well, is there anything\nthat somebody needs to talk about now?\n\n517\n00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.610\n[LAUGH] No,\nif you're actually doing a status meeting,\n\n518\n00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.970\nmake sure you actually follow an agenda\nand give the information that you need.\n\n519\n00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:34.070\nThat's pretty much the clear idea.\n\n520\n00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.070\nDon't call a meeting where all of\nthe sudden somebody goes, well, Daniel,\n\n521\n00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.260\nyou called the meeting.\n\n522\n00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.162\nWhat's this about?\n\n523\n00:25:39.162 --> 00:25:40.029\nI don't know.\n\n524\n00:25:40.029 --> 00:25:42.629\nYeah, we were supposed to\nhave a status meeting.\n\n525\n00:25:42.629 --> 00:25:45.350\nThat's [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Just figured we'd all get together,\n\n526\n00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:46.670\nhanging out and talk a little bit.\n\n527\n00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:48.410\nNo, that's not a good way to do it.\n\n528\n00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:52.130\nHave that bulleted list of\npoints that you want to address.\n\n529\n00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:55.410\nMake sure you give it time to say,\nhey, if anybody has any questions,\n\n530\n00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:58.590\nnow's a great time to ask them\nbecause we're all right here.\n\n531\n00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.090\nGo ahead and face-to-face,\nlook at my body language and\n\n532\n00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:03.690\nmy facial expressions,\nthe tone of my voice,\n\n533\n00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:08.350\nit's not some sterile email that I'm\nsending you with just a list of things.\n\n534\n00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:12.440\nWe can actually interact, and talk,\nand maybe ideas will flow, and\n\n535\n00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.760\nwe can be more productive.\n\n536\n00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.340\n>> There is no doubt that that is\nactually kinda one of the key things,\n\n537\n00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.570\nif you really do like meetings.\n\n538\n00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:20.690\nNow if you're like me,\nmeetings are not my thing.\n\n539\n00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:25.620\nI just sat through so many meeting\nwhere you're just like, just me go so\n\n540\n00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.150\nI can work on the project.\n\n541\n00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:29.210\nJust let me get out of here so\nI could do that.\n\n542\n00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:30.530\nWell that's not the situation we want.\n\n543\n00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:32.550\nSo use an agenda, make sure you cover it.\n\n544\n00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:34.460\nIf you set a time limit for\nit, follow that.\n\n545\n00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:35.770\nIt is kinda the key.\n\n546\n00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.947\nThe last thing that we wanna talk\nabout is, of course, updating, okay?\n\n547\n00:26:38.947 --> 00:26:41.698\nUpdates, I'm not talking\nabout emergency things but\n\n548\n00:26:41.698 --> 00:26:45.763\nupdates to your project, in other words,\nshowing the progress of everything,\n\n549\n00:26:45.763 --> 00:26:47.822\nit should be done periodically, okay?\n\n550\n00:26:47.822 --> 00:26:51.326\nWhether you actually schedule this being\na daily, hopefully it's not but if you do\n\n551\n00:26:51.326 --> 00:26:55.520\nthat, that's fine, every two days, every\nweek, every month, whatever it might be.\n\n552\n00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.980\nMake sure you do it on the same day or\n\n553\n00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.560\nabout the same time is what\nI'm trying to get, right?\n\n554\n00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.820\nBecause periodic updates are how they\nknow it's actually progressing, and\n\n555\n00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.700\nhow things are actually going.\n\n556\n00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.780\nWhen you don't do it, when you skip some,\nwhat ends up happening is then they'll\n\n557\n00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.910\nget one, and they'll go, well,\nwhat about last month's?\n\n558\n00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:14.560\nYou didn't have one, and\nthat's all you have to report is,\n\n559\n00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.980\nI didn't have one last month.\n\n560\n00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:18.089\nIt doesn't again,\nshow a great light on you.\n\n561\n00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.850\nYou wanna make sure\nthat if you do updates,\n\n562\n00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.550\nmake sure you do them periodically.\n\n563\n00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.920\nKeeps everybody informed.\n\n564\n00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.710\nLets them know that things\nare still going on on your project.\n\n565\n00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:29.170\nKeeps your project in their mind as well.\n\n566\n00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:32.170\nAnd that is something you really want us\nespecially if you want your stakeholders\n\n567\n00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:33.440\nto be on your side.\n\n568\n00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.742\nSo, being able to mange\nthose expectations.\n\n569\n00:27:35.742 --> 00:27:40.329\nBeing able to use whatever advantage that\nyou can in your distribution plan, is\n\n570\n00:27:40.329 --> 00:27:44.921\nthe key to making sure that your project\nis gonna have the success that it needs.\n\n571\n00:27:44.921 --> 00:27:47.909\nAnd that your stakeholders feel like\nthat they're really involved and\n\n572\n00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:49.161\ninvested into your project.\n\n573\n00:27:49.161 --> 00:27:51.181\n>> Nail on the head,\nRonnie, nail on the head.\n\n574\n00:27:51.181 --> 00:27:53.380\nThank you so much for\nexplaining these things to us.\n\n575\n00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:57.350\nObviously, these are the kind of things\nthat we might not think about as we become\n\n576\n00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:01.780\nproject managers, but are extremely\nimportant as far as our projects go.\n\n577\n00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:05.040\nAnd obviously, we're trying to\npass an exam here and Project+,\n\n578\n00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.490\nthey might ask you a question or\ntwo based of of this information.\n\n579\n00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:10.740\nSo take heed,\nlisten to what we had to say.\n\n580\n00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.400\nEspecially what Ronnie had to say and\nlearn it.\n\n581\n00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.920\nAssimilate it so that you can pass\nthe exam and more effectively\n\n582\n00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.920\nwork with your stakeholders and distribute\ninformation throughout your project.\n\n583\n00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.420\nRonnie again, thank you for stopping by.\n\n584\n00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.800\nWe appreciate your input and\nyour insight into these topics.\n\n585\n00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.250\nWe thank you guys for joining us today.\n\n586\n00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:28.800\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n587\n00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.811\nFor ITProvTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n588\n00:28:30.811 --> 00:28:31.531\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n589\n00:28:31.531 --> 00:28:33.411\n>>

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.280\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.650\nin today's episode we are moving\non with our Project Plus series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.820\nHopefully you guys have been enjoying that\nand joining us back in the studio again\n\n6\n00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.970\ntoday is our good friend and\nour guiding star, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.300\nRonnie, welcome back to the show today.\n\n8\n00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.880\n>> Well thank you for\n\n9\n00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.010\nhaving me back on the show as we\ncontinue on with our CompTIA Project+.\n\n10\n00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.090\nNow today we're actually looking\nat different types of what we call\n\n11\n00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.710\ncommunication constraints in\nthe project management world.\n\n12\n00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.560\nWe normally talk about the idea of\ncommunication barriers is what we\n\n13\n00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.640\ntalk about.\n\n14\n00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.330\nSo remember that as a Project Manager,\nthere's a lot of\n\n15\n00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.770\ntimes where especially when you start off,\nyour projects are fairly,\n\n16\n00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.750\nI'm not gonna say super small,\nbut normally, they're actually\n\n17\n00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.970\ngonna be with people that you feel fairly\nconfident about working together with.\n\n18\n00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.520\nA lot of times they're may\neven actually be able to fit\n\n19\n00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.490\nall in the same room when you start.\n\n20\n00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.660\nOr maybe even smaller.\n\n21\n00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.590\nIt may only be two or three people.\n\n22\n00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.720\nBut as your management experience\ngets larger and larger and\n\n23\n00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.480\nas you actually start working for\ndifferent companies sometimes, you might\n\n24\n00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.500\nfind that realm of your project management\nexperience begins to grow very rapidly and\n\n25\n00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.200\nbeyond your skill set very quickly,\nespecially in the realms of communication.\n\n26\n00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.440\nNow, remember when we talk about\nthe idea of communications right now.\n\n27\n00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.180\nWe are not talking about controlling those\ncommunications that we spent several\n\n28\n00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.910\nshows, at least a couple\nof shows I should say\n\n29\n00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.330\non managing our communication\nwith stakeholders and\n\n30\n00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.540\nthat's something that's actually great,\nsomething that we actually have to do.\n\n31\n00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.480\nWe also understand the process of\ncourse of communicating with our\n\n32\n00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.860\nteam members as well.\n\n33\n00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.960\nBut there's always this particular\nexperience that you may run across,\n\n34\n00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.270\nin which you're gonna find out that\nthere are some constraints that you have\n\n35\n00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.380\nto deal with.\n\n36\n00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.790\nBecause the very fact that\nthe team that you may be managing,\n\n37\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.050\nor a portion of your team,\nis gonna be remote to you.\n\n38\n00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.770\nIn other words, it's not gonna be\npeople that you'll see day to day.\n\n39\n00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.960\nSometimes it's not even,\nnot only people that you see day to day.\n\n40\n00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.190\nBut it could be people that she\nwork in a different time zone and\n\n41\n00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.610\nthat she speak a different language\n\n42\n00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.220\nin which now all the sudden you have a big\nbarrier that's actually in between you and\n\n43\n00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.170\nthem and what you have to do is\nactually make sure that you understand.\n\n44\n00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.300\nAnd that you can identify a lot of\nthose different constraints and\n\n45\n00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.680\nthat way be able to actually figure out\n\n46\n00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.150\nhow can actually manage the communication\nstuff between us a lot better.\n\n47\n00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.720\nSo that's what we're really focusing on.\n\n48\n00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.010\nWe are going to take a look at a few very\npractical types of constraints that we\n\n49\n00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.680\nhave to deal with and then we'll talk\nabout a few cultural constraints as well.\n\n50\n00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.700\nAnd we will try and\ngive a couple of examples when we do this.\n\n51\n00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.800\nSo, let's go ahead and jump right in.\n\n52\n00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.060\nAnd so, when we start taken look at\none of the most practical things.\n\n53\n00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.950\nI remember, Daniel one of the very\nfirst time that I've actually got\n\n54\n00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.610\nset up to do some training.\n\n55\n00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.490\nActually in a different time zone and\nI didn't think about it at all.\n\n56\n00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.280\nAnd all of the sudden I realize\nsomething that I had forgotten\n\n57\n00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.730\na very important element of some\nof the training that I was doing.\n\n58\n00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.440\nSo of course I called back into the office\nnot realizing I was in a different time\n\n59\n00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.810\nzone and now all of a sudden when I had\nactually called back, it was actually\n\n60\n00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.500\nlater than I thought it was and so\nnobody was actually in the office.\n\n61\n00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.560\nDaniel, have you ever\nexperienced anything like that?\n\n62\n00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.850\n>> Yeah, I worked for a company here in\nFlorida and if anybody knows anything\n\n63\n00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.360\nabout Florida, there are multiple\ntime zones in the state of Florida.\n\n64\n00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.820\nOnce you get over into the panhandle,\n\n65\n00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.550\nyou move into central time after\na certain amount of distance to the west.\n\n66\n00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.260\nAnd you think, I gotta call this office\nup and I need them to reboot a piece of\n\n67\n00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.390\nhardware there right, cause I'm\na network guy, I'm a systems guy.\n\n68\n00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.930\nSo I'm running the network and the systems\nfor each one of our branch offices.\n\n69\n00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.210\nI call them up and they're not there.\n\n70\n00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.830\nUnfortunately, it was like a missions\ncritical type of thing and\n\n71\n00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:49.890\nit was too far for me to drive.\n\n72\n00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.780\nSo I just had to sit there and\nwait until the time zone changed.\n\n73\n00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.080\nPeople start coming into work.\n\n74\n00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.890\nIt can be very, very frustrating.\n\n75\n00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.210\nAnd then again, hey,\ncall me back at lunch.\n\n76\n00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.715\nWell, lunch has a frame of reference.\n\n77\n00:03:59.715 --> 00:04:01.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Most people think 12 o'clock.\n\n78\n00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.760\nWell, it is 12 o'clock Eastern time.\n\n79\n00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.470\nIf I don't say Eastern time,\nthen they don't understand.\n\n80\n00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.570\nThey probably are gonna default\nto their own frame of reference.\n\n81\n00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.440\nIt's what we do at the shows\nwhen we close our shows out.\n\n82\n00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.750\nBetween episodes we say, hey,\n\n83\n00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.840\njoin us tomorrow at around 1:30 eastern\ntime because not every viewer here is\n\n84\n00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.150\non the east coast of the United States or\nin the eastern time zone.\n\n85\n00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.250\nSo you have to make sure\nto preference those things,\n\n86\n00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.250\notherwise your gonna have\nsome communication issues.\n\n87\n00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.500\n>> And with projects, this is incredibly\nimportant and remember why, right?\n\n88\n00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.060\nBecause every projects has\nit's triple constraints.\n\n89\n00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.940\nWe're limited by time, cost as well\nas the actual requirements here.\n\n90\n00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.850\nWell now imagine that what ends up\nhappening during your project is that say,\n\n91\n00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.490\nhey I'm gonna set a standard\nproject status meeting.\n\n92\n00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.720\nAnd every time you do so, okay?\n\n93\n00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.170\nLet's say you actually go look\nhere in the Eastern Time Zone,\n\n94\n00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.870\nthis is a great one for us to use.\n\n95\n00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.510\nWe say, we'll have set this for right,\nan hour before lunchtime, okay?\n\n96\n00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.850\nThat sounds good to us.\n\n97\n00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.090\nAnd normally, here in the Eastern\ntime zone, at least for\n\n98\n00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.300\nus at ITProTV Studios; that means\n12 to 1 is normally our lunch time.\n\n99\n00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.120\nWell now let's say that I have a portion\nof my team that's remote from me\n\n100\n00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.360\nthat is in that central time zone.\n\n101\n00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.580\nAnd that means it's actually\nan hour back from that as well.\n\n102\n00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.270\nSo that actually does work out as\nlong as I actually let people know\n\n103\n00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.150\nthat it's actually that way, okay?\n\n104\n00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.530\nBut now if I tell them, what,\nan hour before lunch time, and\n\n105\n00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.130\nthey wait until, what,\n11 AM to start in their time.\n\n106\n00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.400\nIt's already noon, and\nI'm already eating my sandwich.\n\n107\n00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.020\nAnd so I don't wanna be disturbed\nduring my eating of my sandwich,\n\n108\n00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.210\nbut you kinda get this\nidea that this can happen.\n\n109\n00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.800\nSo time zones are actually a very\nimportant constraint for us.\n\n110\n00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.430\nLet's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n111\n00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.140\nAnd I even took a little of time\nof doing some diagrams here.\n\n112\n00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.960\nLet's say we call that meeting that\nis 9 o'clock in the morning here.\n\n113\n00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.240\nBut let's say our time zone is much more\nremoved, and this one's actually earlier.\n\n114\n00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.910\nLet say is wealth and this guy\nactually they start calling in and\n\n115\n00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.720\nsaid, hey, it's 9 o'clock.\n\n116\n00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.490\nWelcome to our status meeting here.\n\n117\n00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.690\nI want to, wait a minute,\nit's a quarter 'til 6 right now.\n\n118\n00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.810\nAnd now all of a sudden you kinda realize\nyou woke with somebody up at a quarter\n\n119\n00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:09.860\nto 6 AM and.\n\n120\n00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.600\nThey were probably not very happy that you\ncalled them up to actually attend their\n\n121\n00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.090\nproject status meeting.\n\n122\n00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.980\nSo sometimes even stuff like that, right,\nvery practically that could actually help\n\n123\n00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.820\nus out in actually thinking about it,\nwhen we actually realize where they are.\n\n124\n00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.520\nSecondly, we also have to think about\nthe idea of communication preferences.\n\n125\n00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.460\nIt's very easy, right,\nto think that everybody\n\n126\n00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.270\nloves to communicate the same\nway that you do, okay?\n\n127\n00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.220\nI know, I see it every day as I drive\nhome, and you probably see it every day as\n\n128\n00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:40.240\nyou actually go anywhere, that people are\nconstantly connected to their smartphone,\n\n129\n00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.710\nand they're constantly talking\nall the time on that phone.\n\n130\n00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.870\nDaniel, I am one of those people,\neven though I have a smart phone.\n\n131\n00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.800\nSometimes I swear to you,\nI'd rather drive 20 miles to come and\n\n132\n00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.630\nhave a face to face conversation with you\nthen have to get on the phone and dial and\n\n133\n00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.730\nthen wonder if your ever gonna pick up.\n\n134\n00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.950\nSo, when you think about that,\nthat actually does indicate a difference\n\n135\n00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.300\nin preference on the idea\nof communication, right?\n\n136\n00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.760\nAnd so sometimes what could end up\nhappening is that, I might call you and\n\n137\n00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.480\ngo, I'm not gonna talk about this\non the phone it's just too cracky,\n\n138\n00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.712\nit keeps dropping when you're on\nthe highway and [INAUDIBLE] but\n\n139\n00:07:13.712 --> 00:07:16.700\nyou might actually have to pick that\nup and actually realize that hey\n\n140\n00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.660\ndriving there might be the way to\nactually get the message across.\n\n141\n00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.490\n>> Yeah Ronnie is spot on with this.\n\n142\n00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.140\nThere is a lot of different ways in which\nwe can communicate with each other.\n\n143\n00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.910\nThis isn't CompTIA, so don't take\nthis as the gospel of Paul here.\n\n144\n00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:35.107\nBut, I have come up with my own system\nof least to best ways to communicate.\n\n145\n00:07:35.107 --> 00:07:38.355\nText and\nemail is at the bottom of that list.\n\n146\n00:07:38.355 --> 00:07:40.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because it's really difficult,\n\n147\n00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.680\nespecially when it comes to text,\nyou're limited by character.\n\n148\n00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.920\nAnd it has gotten longer now and\npeople tend to write books.\n\n149\n00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.960\nBut, email's the same kind of idea.\n\n150\n00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.587\nIt's hard to convey the emotion,\ninflection.\n\n151\n00:07:50.587 --> 00:07:55.030\nThe nuances of your communication just\ndon't transfer over unless you're some\n\n152\n00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.963\nsort of literary master who is just\namazing at doing that kind of thing.\n\n153\n00:07:58.963 --> 00:08:02.130\nMost people aren't, and so\nthings tend to go wrong.\n\n154\n00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.870\nYou send a text, hey I'll be there in five\nminutes, and someone reads it as, hey,\n\n155\n00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.708\nI'll be there in five minutes, right?\n\n156\n00:08:07.708 --> 00:08:08.850\n>> Yeah.\n>> So these\n\n157\n00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.090\nare the kind of things\nthat occur with texts.\n\n158\n00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.920\nVoice is much better,\nit's definitely a step above, but\n\n159\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.160\ndefinitely not as good\nas a face-to-face cuz,\n\n160\n00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.770\nlike Ronnie said, with the face-to-face,\nthere's no miscommunications.\n\n161\n00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.970\nYou can read body language,\nfacial expressions, the whole nine yards.\n\n162\n00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:26.080\nEvery bit of inflected nuance is there,\nand\n\n163\n00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.770\nusually communication goes\nbest through that means.\n\n164\n00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.960\nDoes that mean that the written\nform is done away with?\n\n165\n00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.776\nNo, we still need it because\nit's great for recording, right,\n\n166\n00:08:34.776 --> 00:08:36.893\nwe've recorded what it\nis we've talked about.\n\n167\n00:08:36.893 --> 00:08:40.929\nSo you do wanna use every type of format\navailable to you to make sure that\n\n168\n00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:45.103\nno matter who, maybe Ronnie likes texts,\nand texts works great for him or\n\n169\n00:08:45.103 --> 00:08:48.354\ne-mails work great for him and\nthat's what he prefers.\n\n170\n00:08:48.354 --> 00:08:51.642\nWell, then we need to use it all so\neveryone's being accommodated and\n\n171\n00:08:51.642 --> 00:08:55.060\neverybody gets the information in\nthe way that they best assimilate it.\n\n172\n00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.780\n>> And that's actually the key right\nthere of what Daniel's mentioning.\n\n173\n00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.730\nRemember that a barrier\ncould be where you go, well,\n\n174\n00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.560\nmy preferred method is let me text you.\n\n175\n00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.050\nAnd somebody looks at it and\ngoes, well I don't receive texts,\n\n176\n00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.230\nI don't like texts,\nI'm not gonna actually use it.\n\n177\n00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.090\nWell, now you actually have to figure\nout how that's actually gonna work.\n\n178\n00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:14.160\nNow, can you actually say, well, too bad,\nthis is the only method I'm gonna use.\n\n179\n00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.980\nWell, remember, you've actually\njust set yourself up as a barrier\n\n180\n00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.530\nas far as the method, which is not\nwhat you want as a project manager.\n\n181\n00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:21.720\nDon't get me wrong, can you?\n\n182\n00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.530\nYes, you can absolutely say\nthe only method that you better\n\n183\n00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.680\nget messages from me is email.\n\n184\n00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.460\nAnd now all of a sudden somebody's saying,\nwell if I'm gonna get messages from you\n\n185\n00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.298\nthat means now I have to go and\nfind a computer or find a phone.\n\n186\n00:09:32.298 --> 00:09:35.160\nWhat if I'm actually one of those\nold dinosaurs like Ronnie Wong,\n\n187\n00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.765\nwhich says I'm not gonna read email\non my phone, it's just too small.\n\n188\n00:09:38.765 --> 00:09:40.010\nI\"m not gonna do that.\n\n189\n00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:43.630\nSo, then you have to wait until\nI actually get to my computer,\n\n190\n00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.880\nmy desktop computer there, and\nbe able to actually read email messages.\n\n191\n00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.260\nAnd you might not get\nthe communication you want.\n\n192\n00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.568\nSo, just kind of realize that that\nis what you don't want to do.\n\n193\n00:09:51.568 --> 00:09:56.360\nYou want to make sure that you, as a\nproject manager, and as establishing this,\n\n194\n00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.410\nespecially with your team members,\nyou try and\n\n195\n00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.535\nfind out what's the most effective\nway to communicate with them.\n\n196\n00:10:01.535 --> 00:10:03.750\nCuz it's easier for\nyou to change, believe it or\n\n197\n00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.840\nnot, while they're actually\nworking on the project.\n\n198\n00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.680\nI don't want this to be a hindrance,\nwhere I tell them, you better go and\n\n199\n00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:13.016\nfind a way to get connected\nto your email right now or\n\n200\n00:10:13.016 --> 00:10:15.550\nto get a text message right now from me,\n\n201\n00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:19.960\nwhen it might actually just be as simple\nand just as good as actually saying,\n\n202\n00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.890\nall right, who do I need to communicate\nto make sure you get that message?\n\n203\n00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.920\nSo you actually do need to do that.\n\n204\n00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.390\nYou can be more flexible than\nsomebody else that really is\n\n205\n00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.490\nincredibly inflexible is\nwhat we're trying to get to.\n\n206\n00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:36.400\nAnd, of course, the biggest difference\nthat we have, one of the biggest\n\n207\n00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.290\nbarriers that we have as far as project\ncommunications go, could end up being\n\n208\n00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:45.630\nsomething like a language barrier, is\nprobably one of the big ones here, okay.\n\n209\n00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:49.820\nSo, we were talking about this\nright before the show here.\n\n210\n00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.360\nI was trying to say, what's one of\nthe languages that can really be,\n\n211\n00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.190\nand we tried to communicate between two\nlanguages and we really didn't know?\n\n212\n00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:03.130\nAnd I thought, to a point, I hate to say\nit, I can probably figure out some French.\n\n213\n00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.420\nIf you talk slow enough,\nI could probably do it.\n\n214\n00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.890\nAnd even some Spanish,\nI could probably do that.\n\n215\n00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.736\nBut one of the languages I probably\ncouldn't, is let's say that we have two\n\n216\n00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:14.190\ndifferent remote teams on our project and\nthey still need to communicate.\n\n217\n00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.770\nBut let's say one's in Icelandic, and\n\n218\n00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.150\nI didn't know what the official\nlanguage was and I was like.\n\n219\n00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.660\n>> It's Icelandic.\n\n220\n00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:20.501\n>> It is Icelandic?\nWell, there it is,\n\n221\n00:11:20.501 --> 00:11:21.620\nit's the Icelandic language.\n\n222\n00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:26.420\nAnd here we are in English, and we believe\nthat actual communication is going on, but\n\n223\n00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.450\nin truth we really don't know.\n\n224\n00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:30.820\nWe really have no clue whether or\n\n225\n00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:36.510\nnot any actual communication is actually\nspoken that's really getting across.\n\n226\n00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:40.400\nNow, I actually put a second sub\npoint down here because it gets even\n\n227\n00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.130\nmore challenging when you now actually\nmove into technical language, right.\n\n228\n00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:49.020\nSome of the things that you go, yeah,\nthis is an easy concept to communicate.\n\n229\n00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:53.390\nWell, now, all of a sudden say, hey we're\ngoing to do subnetting in Icelandic.\n\n230\n00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.897\nAnd now their saying, sub netting,\n\n231\n00:11:54.897 --> 00:11:58.790\nthey're trying to break it apart,\nit doesn't actually turn out that way.\n\n232\n00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:02.030\nSo you may find out that technical\nlanguage actually provides even\n\n233\n00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.110\nmore barriers.\n\n234\n00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.970\nNow, in that sense, it doesn't always\nhave to, because a lot a times,\n\n235\n00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:10.700\nespecially like IT technical training,\nis done in English anyways.\n\n236\n00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.130\nBut at the same time,\n\n237\n00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.920\nyou might not have the entire team over\nthere that understands what's going on.\n\n238\n00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.570\nSo you have to actually learn how to deal\nwith these language barriers as well.\n\n239\n00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:21.020\nSo some of the things are actually easy.\n\n240\n00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.330\nThese that we're talking about here\nare actually fairly easy to deal with.\n\n241\n00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.140\nWe just take into the account\nthe idea of the time zone, right?\n\n242\n00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:31.880\nThe very fact is we don't want to call\na meeting at 9:00 AM Eastern time if my\n\n243\n00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:37.380\nother part of the team is on the Pacific\nTime Zone which is about three hours back.\n\n244\n00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.710\nAnd, don't get me wrong, they might go,\nno, that's perfectly fine,\n\n245\n00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.980\nbut it would be terrible to have\nto try and do something like that.\n\n246\n00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.160\nSo, yes,\nyou wanna make sure that you take that\n\n247\n00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.280\ninto account of what's a good time for\nthem, as well.\n\n248\n00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.100\nThat way they don't feel left out, they\ndon't feel like they're an appendage to\n\n249\n00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.990\nthe team, but\nthey feel like they're a part of it.\n\n250\n00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:58.060\nTry and figure out what the best method\nof communication is between you, and,\n\n251\n00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.680\nof course, those team members that\nare also remote from you, as well.\n\n252\n00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.770\nSo, if it is close enough, it might be\nwhere you do have a face-to-face talk, but\n\n253\n00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:09.350\nif it's not well again you actually have\nto figure out what's gonna be best, and\n\n254\n00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.330\nwhen's the best time to\ncommunication with them.\n\n255\n00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.830\nAnd then, of course, the language\nbarrier probably means some type\n\n256\n00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.640\nof interpreter in-between to help you.\n\n257\n00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.840\nSo in that sense,\nthese actually seem like they have fairly\n\n258\n00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:25.420\neasy solutions to them if we're willing\nto actually take a look at them.\n\n259\n00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:27.640\nBut just kinda realize\nthat this can happen,\n\n260\n00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.740\nand not only can they happen individually,\nit's usually the combination of all three\n\n261\n00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.780\nthat really kinda kick you\nis what ends up happening.\n\n262\n00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.040\nI know that it frustrates me, and\n\n263\n00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.750\nI've seen this before, where I open\nup an email and it was in Spanish.\n\n264\n00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:40.900\nAnd I was like.\n\n265\n00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:41.720\n>> [LAUGH] Google Translate.\n\n266\n00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.800\n>> Yeah, Google Translate is\nwhat you end up doing, yeah.\n\n267\n00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.690\nWow, I did not see that one coming.\n\n268\n00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:52.106\nAnd then you actually realize that they\nwere sending it from somewhere where\n\n269\n00:13:52.106 --> 00:13:54.500\nSpanish was the native language.\n\n270\n00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.290\nSo now you actually have all three\nessentially attacking you, but\n\n271\n00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.110\nyou do have a lot of tools out\nthere to help you with that.\n\n272\n00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:05.450\nA little bit more tricky though, okay,\nis when we start actually navigating\n\n273\n00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:10.490\nthe things that are not as easily seen and\nset, okay, right before you.\n\n274\n00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:14.830\nSo let's take a look at some of the other\ntypes of communication constraints here\n\n275\n00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:16.790\nthat we want to talk about.\n\n276\n00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.740\nSo some of the things that we have\nto deal with are some of the things\n\n277\n00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.130\nwe talked about during\nthe pre-project setup,\n\n278\n00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:25.260\nas well, such as the organization\nmatrices that we have, right?\n\n279\n00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.780\nThe very fact is that you may\nactually run into this factor for\n\n280\n00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:33.170\nyour project, that there is already\nan established hierarchy there, and\n\n281\n00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.240\nnow you're inserted somewhere in there.\n\n282\n00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.560\nAnd the problem with that insertion is\nthat that now brings things like divided\n\n283\n00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.170\nloyalties, if that particular functional\nmanager needs somebody to be on their\n\n284\n00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:44.560\nside for something, okay.\n\n285\n00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.900\nIt brings in the idea of politics, and\neven power struggles about who's going to\n\n286\n00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.420\nbe using the resource at\nthat particular time.\n\n287\n00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:55.390\nAnd you can't blame your team members\nif they have to serve both masters,\n\n288\n00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:59.930\nof choosing one at some particular\npoint in time over what you did, or\n\n289\n00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.510\nyou have to be careful.\n\n290\n00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:06.370\nThe reason why is that functional master\na lot of times in those matrices types of\n\n291\n00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:10.290\norganizations, on the weak matrix and\nthe kind of balance matrix,\n\n292\n00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:14.820\nthose are normally the organizations that\nare paying their particular workers.\n\n293\n00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.790\nAnd they're essentially\njust loaning you that for\n\n294\n00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.710\na brief period of time to do your project.\n\n295\n00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.310\nSo you can't blame them for that, but you\ndo have to realize that this is a barrier\n\n296\n00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:27.390\nto you getting the information across,\nand that becoming effective, as well.\n\n297\n00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:30.120\nSo that's a big one that\nyou have to worry about.\n\n298\n00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.240\nThen, of course,\nthere's technology barriers.\n\n299\n00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.540\nNow, one of these technology barriers\nis something that happens to all of us,\n\n300\n00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.098\na change in the infrastructure\nof what we do.\n\n301\n00:15:39.098 --> 00:15:43.537\nImagine coming into an organization and\nthen a week later they tell you,\n\n302\n00:15:43.537 --> 00:15:46.575\nwe're no longer using that communication\nsystem that we actually did.\n\n303\n00:15:46.575 --> 00:15:50.004\nWe're now switching over\nto this totally new system.\n\n304\n00:15:50.004 --> 00:15:54.504\nWell, you can imagine now that all of\na sudden people that actually have\n\n305\n00:15:54.504 --> 00:15:59.304\nbeen used to using their old system for\na long time, now you change over, and\n\n306\n00:15:59.304 --> 00:16:01.254\nnow retraining has to be done.\n\n307\n00:16:01.254 --> 00:16:03.547\nSo a lot of times,\nyou have to think about that.\n\n308\n00:16:03.547 --> 00:16:08.060\nSometimes even actual proficiency things\nend up happening as far as the barrier.\n\n309\n00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.122\nSomebody on our project that's actually\nreally proficient at whatever they're\n\n310\n00:16:13.122 --> 00:16:14.553\ndoing, they end up leaving.\n\n311\n00:16:14.553 --> 00:16:17.556\nAnd now, we have their particular\nperson that was following them and\n\n312\n00:16:17.556 --> 00:16:20.839\nactually learned about the product\na little bit or project whatever it is.\n\n313\n00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.060\nCan do it, but\nthey're just not as proficient.\n\n314\n00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:28.010\nSo a lot of things that\nwere done very quickly\n\n315\n00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:32.570\nnow are actually having to be done again\nor having to be done a little bit slower.\n\n316\n00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.620\nAnd every time that slowness adds up,\nit stacks up.\n\n317\n00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.250\nKind of brings a little\nbit of frustration there.\n\n318\n00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.467\nRemember that if they're not\nsufficiently trained again,\n\n319\n00:16:40.467 --> 00:16:42.167\non certain things you'll\nactually see that.\n\n320\n00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:44.670\nAnd then it actually\nrequires more time as well.\n\n321\n00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.740\nSo all this stuff can actually become\na barrier to you getting your project done\n\n322\n00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.740\nand to the communication going on,\nbecause you're expecting what?\n\n323\n00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.640\nThis is the way it should have been and\nyou're just not getting it.\n\n324\n00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.210\n>> Yeah, and in my experience and\nI'm not trying to pigeon hole anyone,\n\n325\n00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:01.875\njust in general my older users.\n\n326\n00:17:01.875 --> 00:17:04.311\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm a tech guy, I do sys admin.\n\n327\n00:17:04.311 --> 00:17:06.524\nWhenever you implement\nsome new technology,\n\n328\n00:17:06.524 --> 00:17:08.974\nsomething that's just come out,\nawesome stuff.\n\n329\n00:17:08.974 --> 00:17:11.250\nThey're not the ones going, awesome!\n\n330\n00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:11.863\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Excellent!\n\n331\n00:17:11.863 --> 00:17:14.439\nNew stuff,\nthat thing that I've been working with for\n\n332\n00:17:14.439 --> 00:17:16.880\nthe last 25 years is\nout the window finally.\n\n333\n00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.086\nAnd now I get to learn an entire new\nsystem that I really have no frame of\n\n334\n00:17:20.086 --> 00:17:20.874\nreference for.\n\n335\n00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:21.529\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n336\n00:17:21.529 --> 00:17:23.315\n>> They don't tend to go down that line.\n\n337\n00:17:23.315 --> 00:17:25.504\nThey tend to be very standoffish.\n\n338\n00:17:25.504 --> 00:17:30.450\nThey hold fast to what they know because\nthey know it, and that's understandable.\n\n339\n00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.441\nSo you just need to be understandable and\nthat will help move them along,\n\n340\n00:17:33.441 --> 00:17:35.711\nwhich will then increase\nthe flow of communications.\n\n341\n00:17:35.711 --> 00:17:38.870\nWhich is what we're trying to do,\nbreak down those communications barriers.\n\n342\n00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.747\n>> You really are, and one of the last\nones that we wanna talk about is,\n\n343\n00:17:41.747 --> 00:17:42.868\nI saved this one for last.\n\n344\n00:17:42.868 --> 00:17:45.768\nBecause this is kind of the one that\ncan get you in trouble if you don't\n\n345\n00:17:45.768 --> 00:17:47.190\npay attention to them.\n\n346\n00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.950\nAnd that's why I wanna save this one for\nlast as well.\n\n347\n00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.734\nDon't get me wrong, people that actually\nknow that your trying to speak a different\n\n348\n00:17:53.734 --> 00:17:55.653\nlanguage, they know and they struggle and\n\n349\n00:17:55.653 --> 00:17:58.178\nthey may even play with you\non the language a little bit.\n\n350\n00:17:58.178 --> 00:18:01.271\nAnd they get a little bit annoyed that\nyou're not actually using their timezone\n\n351\n00:18:01.271 --> 00:18:03.730\nand stuff like that, but\nthey'll overcome things like that.\n\n352\n00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:07.740\nBut what they won't overcome is the idea\nof cultural differences if you're\n\n353\n00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.790\nnot even willing to respect\nthe cultural differences\n\n354\n00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.040\nas you're working on these projects.\n\n355\n00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.770\nSo let's just take for\nan example the idea of formality here.\n\n356\n00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:18.443\nSo when you think about this idea.\n\n357\n00:18:18.443 --> 00:18:20.840\nLet's say, that Dan and I,\nwe work in an office together.\n\n358\n00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.381\nAnd so in the morning Daniel says hey,\nRonnie or good morning, Ronnie and\n\n359\n00:18:24.381 --> 00:18:26.508\nI say the same thing hey,\ngood morning Dan.\n\n360\n00:18:26.508 --> 00:18:30.568\nThat's perfectly fine, but you may\nactually come from a country in which\n\n361\n00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:34.370\nyou don’t actually do that as\nfar as that informality goes.\n\n362\n00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:38.110\nYou may actually end up working with\na bunch of people in which you're actually\n\n363\n00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:41.581\nsuppose to address by surnames instead and\nnot actually the first name.\n\n364\n00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:45.639\nEspecially if you are not actually told\nhey, why don't you just call me Ronnie or\n\n365\n00:18:45.639 --> 00:18:48.040\ncall me Dan, whatever it might be here.\n\n366\n00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:52.131\nSo even something as simple as that, even\nwhen the culture is not that different\n\n367\n00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:54.282\nsometimes, you may actually have that.\n\n368\n00:18:54.282 --> 00:18:58.110\nYou can actually see\npeople like this even now.\n\n369\n00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:01.964\nAnd I've run into this a couple of\ntimes where I've actually done some\n\n370\n00:19:01.964 --> 00:19:05.162\ntraining even on army bases and\nin some navy bases as well,\n\n371\n00:19:05.162 --> 00:19:07.266\nactually airforce base, excuse me.\n\n372\n00:19:07.266 --> 00:19:12.410\nAnd some airforce bases in which\none time that my point of contact.\n\n373\n00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:16.930\nHe actually said hey, just call me Frank.\n\n374\n00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:21.320\nAnother time the guy said, call me Master,\nSergeant so and so, that's what he said.\n\n375\n00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.393\nSo you kind of understand\nthat they're saying what,\n\n376\n00:19:24.393 --> 00:19:27.889\nno you're not gonna address me as Bob or\nDan or whoever it is.\n\n377\n00:19:27.889 --> 00:19:30.380\nYou're gonna address me as Master,\nSergeant, so and so.\n\n378\n00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.520\nAnd that's what they actually mean,\nis that did you use that.\n\n379\n00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.410\nMake sure you don't just walk\nin with an informality that\n\n380\n00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.730\nyou're not supposed to have as well.\n\n381\n00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:44.630\nAlso remember that in some cultures, it's\na big direct communication is a big thing.\n\n382\n00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:48.530\nIn Western society we really do,\nwe want to get to the point and\n\n383\n00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:49.950\nwe want that to happen.\n\n384\n00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:51.980\nBut if you are an Eastern culture,\n\n385\n00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:56.181\nyou're mindset a lot of times it is\nnot their responsibility of someone\n\n386\n00:19:56.181 --> 00:20:01.100\nthat's actually not at the same level of\nyou to actually suggest you do something.\n\n387\n00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:06.292\nIt is up to them to actually indirectly\njust try and bring you along or to\n\n388\n00:20:06.292 --> 00:20:12.102\nactually just say, you tell me what needs\nto be done and then that will be done.\n\n389\n00:20:12.102 --> 00:20:13.862\nAnd then when it doesn't work again,\n\n390\n00:20:13.862 --> 00:20:16.630\nyou essentially just kind\nof continue to do that.\n\n391\n00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:20.701\nBut you do not have that right to just\ngo up and go no, you are doing it wrong.\n\n392\n00:20:20.701 --> 00:20:22.550\nIt has to be done this way.\n\n393\n00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:26.616\nSo a lot of times you might find\nout that indirect communication for\n\n394\n00:20:26.616 --> 00:20:31.568\npeople in that culture may actually be the\nway to go instead of the direct one too.\n\n395\n00:20:31.568 --> 00:20:33.510\nSo what does that mean for you then?\n\n396\n00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.330\nIt means a little bit of background and\n\n397\n00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:41.520\nresearch if you end up having to deal\nwith some type of cross cultural element.\n\n398\n00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.630\nEspecially in your project too, and\n\n399\n00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:46.240\nalso the idea of being\naware of certain customs.\n\n400\n00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.730\nJust because I am US centric here,\n\n401\n00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:55.380\ncuz everything I do is in the country that\nwe live in, that I might think about thing\n\n402\n00:20:55.380 --> 00:21:00.670\nlike observing certain holidays here that\nmight not be observed in another country.\n\n403\n00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:03.540\nBut remember that there maybe times\nwhen I have to actually do what?\n\n404\n00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:08.050\nObserve their holidays when to me\nit's actually a regular workday.\n\n405\n00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.780\nAnd I saw one of these perfect examples of\nthis on one of the shows that they have on\n\n406\n00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:15.050\nTV where they do like a documentary, where\nthey have like Mega Builders or something.\n\n407\n00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.200\nIn which they were building a bridge,\n\n408\n00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.810\nI think it was in Hong Kong going\nacross and it was the Chinese New Year.\n\n409\n00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:28.824\nWell they stopped, and they actually\ndid this kind of little ceremony for\n\n410\n00:21:28.824 --> 00:21:31.445\nthat day and honoring that day.\n\n411\n00:21:31.445 --> 00:21:35.820\nAnd so the entire project stopped for that\nparticular point in time, just to do that.\n\n412\n00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.350\nI know that's just a couple of hours or\nthree hours, but\n\n413\n00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:40.810\nthe project manager turned around and\nsaid, this is very important for\n\n414\n00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:44.830\nus to show that we do respect the customs,\nthat we are actually grateful to\n\n415\n00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.210\nbe allowed work here and\nto be able to work with the people.\n\n416\n00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.210\nAnd so they did that,\nhad their celebration just briefly,\n\n417\n00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.040\nand then they all went back to work.\n\n418\n00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.150\nIt was kind of neat, just being able\nto say, here's what needs to be done,\n\n419\n00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:58.600\nand they were able to do that as well.\n\n420\n00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.333\nAnd you may also find yourself\nin that situation too.\n\n421\n00:22:01.333 --> 00:22:04.508\nSo just kind of realize that the idea\nof barriers for your project,\n\n422\n00:22:04.508 --> 00:22:08.310\nyou're gonna run into them because,\nyou're gonna work with remote people and\n\n423\n00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:11.420\nsometimes those remote people\nwon't speak the same language.\n\n424\n00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.500\nSometimes they won't even have\nsame reference that you'll have.\n\n425\n00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.030\nYou still have to overcome them.\n\n426\n00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.950\nThere's different ways for us to do that.\n\n427\n00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:21.510\nBut the key for you as a project manager\nis to understand all of those things that\n\n428\n00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:25.120\nactually will exists for you and\nthat means you have to be on top of it.\n\n429\n00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.600\n>> Yeah, Ronnie and it does so deep.\n\n430\n00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.090\nThere's so many ways,\nwe've just given you a good general.\n\n431\n00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.290\nOf course this is a things that come\nto you and want you to know for\n\n432\n00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.100\nthe exam, but\nit's basically a generalization.\n\n433\n00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.330\nHere are the main ways in which\nyou'll see barriers brought up\n\n434\n00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:38.860\nto your communication with other people.\n\n435\n00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:43.114\nAnd I think about language, and\nI think even accent can cause a problem.\n\n436\n00:22:43.114 --> 00:22:47.641\nI don't understand because your accent is\nthick, and usually that's because it's not\n\n437\n00:22:47.641 --> 00:22:51.870\na native language speaker of whatever\nlanguage that you're working with.\n\n438\n00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.651\nAnd therefore the action\ncomes in colloquialisms.\n\n439\n00:22:53.651 --> 00:22:54.220\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n440\n00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.777\nI don't understand this analogy\nthat you've thrown at me.\n\n441\n00:22:56.777 --> 00:22:59.570\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Yeah, it doesn't make any sense to me.\n\n442\n00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.110\nSo you gotta be careful,\n\n443\n00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:04.990\nyou can't just use your own\ncolloquialisms that you're used to.\n\n444\n00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.520\nThe idioms that you've grown up with,\nthey might not apply and\n\n445\n00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.510\nsomebody might even take offence to them\nbecause of the way their culture is.\n\n446\n00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:16.788\nSo it's just better to be, I would say,\nto be as direct as possible and\n\n447\n00:23:16.788 --> 00:23:20.380\nalways be as formal as\nyou can until otherwise.\n\n448\n00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.437\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Told, right?\n\n449\n00:23:21.437 --> 00:23:23.991\nUnless someone says hey, call me Bob.\n\n450\n00:23:23.991 --> 00:23:25.185\nThat way you start off\n\n451\n00:23:25.185 --> 00:23:27.436\nwith Master Sergeant Wilkerson-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n452\n00:23:27.436 --> 00:23:28.664\n>> Or whatever his name is.\n\n453\n00:23:28.664 --> 00:23:30.390\nAnd then he goes, call me Bob,\nthen you call him Bob.\n\n454\n00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.150\nDon't start off with calling him Bob,\nand then have to be told hey,\n\n455\n00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.800\ncall me Master Sergeant Wilkerson.\n\n456\n00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.041\nThat's the better way to go.\n\n457\n00:23:36.041 --> 00:23:38.990\nRonnie, is there anything else we need to\ntalk about before we wrap this episode up?\n\n458\n00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:42.550\n>> Well not really as far as the different\nbarriers that we're gonna run into when\n\n459\n00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:43.930\nwe're working with remote teams.\n\n460\n00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:47.070\nBut remember, communications is\na huge part of everything that we\n\n461\n00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.890\ndo as a project manager.\n\n462\n00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.310\nAnd a lot of times and\nif you even read inside the PNP, and\n\n463\n00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:53.650\nI mentioned this during\nour project planning.\n\n464\n00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:56.393\nThey really do recommend about 90%.\n\n465\n00:23:56.393 --> 00:24:01.613\nSo 90% of your time as a project manager\nduring this phase is about communication.\n\n466\n00:24:01.613 --> 00:24:04.603\nIn other words, you actually making\nsure that good communication is going,\n\n467\n00:24:04.603 --> 00:24:06.312\nthat you're having good communications.\n\n468\n00:24:06.312 --> 00:24:08.530\nIt means you need to\nspent more time on it.\n\n469\n00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.870\nDon't just look and see what pleases you.\n\n470\n00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.548\nLook at what's gonna be effective for\nyour project.\n\n471\n00:24:12.548 --> 00:24:15.435\nMake sure you actually provide\nthose communication pathways and\n\n472\n00:24:15.435 --> 00:24:17.333\nmake it easier for everybody else to work.\n\n473\n00:24:17.333 --> 00:24:17.957\n>> Well Ronnie,\n\n474\n00:24:17.957 --> 00:24:19.925\ngreat communication here with us-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n475\n00:24:19.925 --> 00:24:21.760\n>> And our viewers.\n\n476\n00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.200\nHopefully there were no barriers\nin that way and if there are,\n\n477\n00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.290\nnow you are equipped to overcome them.\n\n478\n00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:29.500\nThanks again for showing up today,\nand explaining these concepts to us.\n\n479\n00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.720\nThank you guys for watching.\n\n480\n00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.984\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off, we're ITProTV.\n\n481\n00:24:32.984 -->

great\nepisode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.160\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n5\n00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.760\nin today's episode we are continuing\non with our Project+ series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.940\nHopefully you'll be getting a lot of\ninformation out of that moving up to where\n\n7\n00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.630\nyou're actually taking the exam.\n\n8\n00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.680\nJoining us back in the studio today\nto help you in that very endeavor\n\n9\n00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.160\nis our good friend Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.490\nRonnie, welcome back to the show sir.\n\n11\n00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.690\n>> Well thank you for\nhaving me on the show.\n\n12\n00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.970\nAs we continue on to take\na look at CompTIA's Project+.\n\n13\n00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.140\nNow we're actually beginning a brand\nnew domain objective for us,\n\n14\n00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.900\nwhich means we're coming close toward the\nend of our series here in project plus.\n\n15\n00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.110\nAnd that means we're actually at\nthe closing stage is what we're\n\n16\n00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.580\ntaking a look at here.\n\n17\n00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.280\nSo what we actually want to do today,\nright, is to take a little deeper look\n\n18\n00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.490\nat the idea and importance of what\na formal project closure is about.\n\n19\n00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.710\nAnd why it's something that\nwe want to be able to do.\n\n20\n00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.770\nNow there's a lot of things that go on\ninside of a project and it's fairly easy\n\n21\n00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.470\nthat you might think about here, but\noverall though, we want to actually\n\n22\n00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.390\nestablish some type of formal method that\nsays that we are done with our project.\n\n23\n00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.890\nSo, when we start taking a look at\nthe overall project phases themselves,\n\n24\n00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.640\nremember we had that pre-project setup or\nthe initiation.\n\n25\n00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.500\nWe also then went into the planning stage.\n\n26\n00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.160\nWe've talked about execution as\nwell as monitoring and controlling.\n\n27\n00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.770\nAnd we've actually mentioned all of that.\n\n28\n00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.260\nSo now we're moving into the final\nstage of the overall project that\n\n29\n00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.960\nwe're actually in, which is the idea\nof course of closing out our project.\n\n30\n00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.580\nAnd establishing the need and the reason\nfor actually doing a project closing.\n\n31\n00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.670\nSo in our reality what\nhappens at a project closing?\n\n32\n00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.280\nMost of the time we get done\nwith our project we simply say,\n\n33\n00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.440\nright good job, bye.\n\n34\n00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.870\nAnd we're done and that's pretty much it.\n\n35\n00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.650\nAnd a lot of times, it may not even go off\nwith so much as a formal like we're done\n\n36\n00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.020\nwith the project is just that\nwe finished that last task.\n\n37\n00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.310\nAnd it's like, all right we're done and\nwe don't do anything else.\n\n38\n00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.920\nNow that is not actually is not exactly\nthe worst way to actually finish\n\n39\n00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.920\nout a project.\n\n40\n00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.480\nBut the problem with that,\nespecially in project management,\n\n41\n00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.980\nis something that's simple.\n\n42\n00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.930\nYou can't really then end up using a lot\nof the information that you might have\n\n43\n00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.600\nlearned from managing that overall\nproject let's say in a future project.\n\n44\n00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.840\nIn other words you've actually just said\nlook we're winging this and you know we'll\n\n45\n00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.340\ndo some project documentation when we have\nthe time, but it's more essential that\n\n46\n00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.750\nI actually do all this then think about\nthe idea of the posterior of the project.\n\n47\n00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.610\nWhere it was left off,\nhow it was done, no matter what.\n\n48\n00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.370\nSo a lot of times projects\nessentially just kind of peter out.\n\n49\n00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.920\nIn other words they just kind of whimper\nand that's pretty much all there is.\n\n50\n00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.270\nWhat the idea behind the PMBOK and\n\n51\n00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.310\nthe PMI and all these projects\nmentions that can be together.\n\n52\n00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.760\nAs well as there’s so\nmuch that can be learn from\n\n53\n00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.000\nevery single project does ever done\nthat what everybody needs to do,\n\n54\n00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.980\nwhat every project manager needs to\ndo it is a century formally closed\n\n55\n00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.170\nout of the project and\ngo through a closing process itself.\n\n56\n00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.750\nSo what happens inside of\nthe closing process or the closing\n\n57\n00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.170\nphase of our project is usually a couple\nof separate elements that go on.\n\n58\n00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.550\nOne is what we call the closed\nproject process and\n\n59\n00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.000\nthe other one is actually the closed\nprocurement process as well.\n\n60\n00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.570\nAnd we're gonna kind of dive into that and\n\n61\n00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.720\ntalk about what each one of those\ncomponents are actually made of, and\n\n62\n00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.160\nallows us to be able to see, and\nwhy we actually want to do that.\n\n63\n00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.710\nSo let's go ahead and start here by taking\na look at the closed project process here.\n\n64\n00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.430\nAnd why it's actually important for us.\n\n65\n00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.420\nAnd I've tried to bring up all the\nelements that we need to remember here.\n\n66\n00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.310\nOkay?\n\n67\n00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.610\nOne is a formal sign off.\n\n68\n00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.250\nNow that's actually very important for\nus here.\n\n69\n00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.760\nIn other words,\n\n70\n00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.370\nwhat we're doing as a project\nmanager is we're saying we are done.\n\n71\n00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.680\nThere's no more processes to work on.\n\n72\n00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.610\nThere's no more anything for\nme to produce.\n\n73\n00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.690\nThat what we have now is\nessentially a deliverable.\n\n74\n00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.430\nIt is what I signed on to create.\n\n75\n00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.900\nAs what I believed that\nwe've actually done here.\n\n76\n00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.610\nAnd now I'm saying that this particular\nresult, product, or whatever it might be.\n\n77\n00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.960\nProcess that we came up with,\nis now done and completed.\n\n78\n00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.470\nAnd the other part of it of course\nthen is also the idea of the hand off\n\n79\n00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.070\nthat we also have too.\n\n80\n00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.350\nWhich is turning it over then or\ntransitioning to the idea of operations.\n\n81\n00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.650\nSo sometimes it could be a product where\nwe actually say here's the finished\n\n82\n00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.680\nproduct here, and now we're actually\nturning it over to these operations\n\n83\n00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.840\nthat can then reproduce that product that\nwe actually ended up making and doing.\n\n84\n00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.320\nSo in that particular phase there,\n\n85\n00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.530\nit actually is a formality where\nwe go this is what we believe.\n\n86\n00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.472\nAnd so this way we actually document\nthat point in time where we say,\n\n87\n00:04:48.472 --> 00:04:52.276\nwe've done our job and\nnow the acceptance of that deliverable and\n\n88\n00:04:52.276 --> 00:04:55.113\nthe transference into\nthe operations stage is,\n\n89\n00:04:55.113 --> 00:04:59.087\nwhat is going on here the project\nis no longer actually continue on.\n\n90\n00:04:59.087 --> 00:05:03.222\nSo it's very important that we have that\nin mind here because if not you may start\n\n91\n00:05:03.222 --> 00:05:06.880\nproject teams that's wondering what\ndo we do next, what do we do now?\n\n92\n00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.100\nWhat we are actually doing now is we're\nbringing to a close all the operations and\n\n93\n00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.730\nwe're handing it off, and that way\neverybody, all of our stakeholders, know\n\n94\n00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.510\nthat we're not spending any more money\non this, and we are ready to go, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.500\nThe other thing that it also allows us to\ndo in the project closure is to go back\n\n96\n00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.580\nand essentially cross the t's and\ndot the i's to our project, okay?\n\n97\n00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.520\nYou might find out that, hey,\n\n98\n00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.410\nI went though everyone of these processes\nhere and went through all of this stuff,\n\n99\n00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.220\nand I can confirm that all\nthe work packages have been done.\n\n100\n00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.240\nOr if you're like me sometimes you go,\nall the work packages have been done.\n\n101\n00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.530\nI go back and I check and go,\ntwo work packages didn't get done yet.\n\n102\n00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.310\nSo, either I need to start that process or\nit's too late now and\n\n103\n00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.400\nI just need to know that those\nprocesses did not get done.\n\n104\n00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.150\nThat's a very important thing because\nit actually let's you know that not\n\n105\n00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.620\neverything always goes\naccording to your plan.\n\n106\n00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.770\nAnd you are actually going to let\nit kinda fall through the cracks.\n\n107\n00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.590\nIf you're not on top of your plan,\n\n108\n00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.450\nand I've been guilty of that a couple of\nin my life which it just got distracted.\n\n109\n00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.310\nAnd got distracted and then at\nthe end of the project looked over and\n\n110\n00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.830\ngo, yeah, I didn't actually get to that,\neven though I thought I really did.\n\n111\n00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.630\nSo it really does help you to actually\nknow whether or not you are completed too.\n\n112\n00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.420\nThe other thing is think about this for\n\n113\n00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.190\nyour resources that\nworking on the project.\n\n114\n00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:33.120\nIt gives them the freedom and ability\nto actually accept another project.\n\n115\n00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.930\nIf not, if you don't have a closeout\nprocess, they don't know if they're\n\n116\n00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.600\nactually still being on hold to work\non anything further from you, or\n\n117\n00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.400\nif they now can actually be released to\nother things that they need to work on.\n\n118\n00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.940\nSo it's a very important thing that we\nactually do understand why this formality\n\n119\n00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.880\nis actually there.\n\n120\n00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.680\nBecause resources can wait around, if\nyou're willing to pay them to wait around,\n\n121\n00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.090\nbut if you're not, then you actually have\nsome issues that you have to deal with.\n\n122\n00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.130\n>> Yeah i definitely have the old joke\ncome up, I'm being paid by the hour,\n\n123\n00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.500\nI'll sit here as many\nhours as you'd like me to.\n\n124\n00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.270\n[LAUGH].\nAnd wait for\n\n125\n00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.950\nyou to tell me exactly what\nyou'd like me to accomplish and\n\n126\n00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.520\nthat is the case Ronnie is exactly right.\n\n127\n00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.980\nYou wanna make sure that, well,\nif I got Jill and Bob over here\n\n128\n00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.605\nwaiting on the wings to do work, that is\nalready completed, I need to let them go.\n\n129\n00:07:16.605 --> 00:07:18.495\nI need to say okay you can go back.\n\n130\n00:07:18.495 --> 00:07:22.195\nMaybe I've pulled them from another\nresource, maybe they come from a different\n\n131\n00:07:22.195 --> 00:07:25.195\ndepartment and they had a specialty\nI needed for this project and\n\n132\n00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:27.495\nI utilized them as a resource in that way.\n\n133\n00:07:27.495 --> 00:07:30.215\nAnd not they're thinking I'm still doing\nthat because they don't have any idea\n\n134\n00:07:30.215 --> 00:07:33.055\nwhether the project is ongoing or\nif it's complete.\n\n135\n00:07:33.055 --> 00:07:37.850\nI have to then officially say\nyou are relieved of your duties.\n\n136\n00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.790\nWith this project because\nthe project is over.\n\n137\n00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.630\nWe will not need you unless a new project\ncome on that's in a similar vein.\n\n138\n00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.290\nOr maybe we wanted to reopen this\nproject for whatever reason.\n\n139\n00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:52.600\nMaybe we forgot some deliverables there\nthat might be a little important.\n\n140\n00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.630\nSo we have to look out for that.\n\n141\n00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:57.103\nBut, in a best case scenario\nyou just need to release them,\n\n142\n00:07:57.103 --> 00:08:01.004\nlet them go back to their duties and\nbeing productive in that vein.\n\n143\n00:08:01.004 --> 00:08:04.572\n>> You really do, because what ends\nup happening is, what Daniel said,\n\n144\n00:08:04.572 --> 00:08:08.441\neither they wait around for you, Or\nthey'll just drift off of something and\n\n145\n00:08:08.441 --> 00:08:11.680\nif you really needed them\nthen you gotta let them know.\n\n146\n00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.211\nSo here in this closing stage you are\nreally just signing off and that actually\n\n147\n00:08:15.211 --> 00:08:18.375\ngives everybody the freedom to go\ntheir way to do what they need to do.\n\n148\n00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:22.196\nOne of the most important elements here,\nof course, is making sure that you do have\n\n149\n00:08:22.196 --> 00:08:25.270\nsome historical document\nthat your project existed.\n\n150\n00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.730\nThat you did accomplish to work\nthat you said that you did,\n\n151\n00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.480\nand that there's actually\ndocumentation to prove this.\n\n152\n00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.640\nNow you may be wondering, why?\n\n153\n00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.600\nThe reason why here is that, remember that\nwhatever you've actually created now,\n\n154\n00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.950\nokay, whatever you've actually done\nin the process of this project, okay,\n\n155\n00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:46.800\nthere are ramifications that are beyond\njust the idea of creating a product, okay?\n\n156\n00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.990\nAnd that particular type of ramification\n\n157\n00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.750\ncan have to do with the idea of different\ncompliances that are out there.\n\n158\n00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.660\nIf you produce a product let's say that's\ngoing to be used on the highway, okay,\n\n159\n00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.760\nhere in the States.\n\n160\n00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.590\nIt has to meet certain types of Department\nof Transportation requirements.\n\n161\n00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.010\nIt has to, okay?\n\n162\n00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.030\nWell, what is that?\n\n163\n00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.460\nThat's all about liability.\n\n164\n00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.510\nAll about different things and\nif you can't show that you did something\n\n165\n00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.200\nlike that, where you actually said,\nno, here's the testing that we did.\n\n166\n00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.870\nHere's the documents that\nprove that we did this,\n\n167\n00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.160\nwe gotta actually make\nsure that we do that.\n\n168\n00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.790\nSo, it could be legal compliance as well.\n\n169\n00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.680\nThink about the idea of contracts\nthat you created during your project,\n\n170\n00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.950\nor you actually pulled in\noutside resources, right?\n\n171\n00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:31.990\nAnd now there's a contract\ndispute with somebody else.\n\n172\n00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:37.430\nWell, they want you to actually produce\nthat document or that contract again.\n\n173\n00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.375\nAnd now you go, yo,\nI was supposed to keep that?\n\n174\n00:09:41.375 --> 00:09:43.035\nYes, yes, you were.\n\n175\n00:09:43.035 --> 00:09:45.849\n[LAUGH] When it comes down to it,\nthese are the things that you might go,\n\n176\n00:09:45.849 --> 00:09:48.380\nwe don't really have to\nactually worry about that.\n\n177\n00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.620\nBut remember, this is actually protecting\nthose people that you hired as well as\n\n178\n00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:52.810\nyour project.\n\n179\n00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:58.090\nBecause if they say, well Dan said that\nhe was contracted with you for this time.\n\n180\n00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.220\nAnd you know, this is something that\nthey wanna bring up in court about,\n\n181\n00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:05.180\nand you can simply go back into your\nproject into the historical documentation\n\n182\n00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.780\nhere about keeping everything.\n\n183\n00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.410\nAnd say, yes,\nhere's the contract, and yes.\n\n184\n00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.750\nAnd we can actually verify\nthrough work records,\n\n185\n00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.250\nDan was on the job from\nthis point to this point.\n\n186\n00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:18.100\nAnd it really is about the idea of\nstuff getting done and whether or\n\n187\n00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.180\nnot it can be proved as well.\n\n188\n00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.740\nYou'd hate for this to actually come\nout where the end of your project.\n\n189\n00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.840\nYou produce something, and\ntwo weeks or four weeks later,\n\n190\n00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.600\nsomebody else produced something,\nand now they say, you mimicked us.\n\n191\n00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.940\nAnd it's like, wait a minute.\n\n192\n00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.490\nWe finished ours first.\n\n193\n00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:34.330\nBut they actually produced all\nthe documentation and we didn't.\n\n194\n00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.970\nSo you do have stuff like that as well,\nokay?\n\n195\n00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:40.390\nAnd then lastly,\nwhere is this thing going to be stored?\n\n196\n00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:42.330\nNow this is actually an ever changing\n\n197\n00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:48.380\nmarket in terms of storing big data and\nthat's pretty much the key.\n\n198\n00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.490\nSo in some project management\nshops that are actually out there,\n\n199\n00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:55.390\nyou might actually go historical and\nyou might see they have essentially a room\n\n200\n00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:59.850\nfull of every single project,\nthat's in little binders or in big binders\n\n201\n00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:03.200\nof all the data that's actually\ncollected and gathered for that project.\n\n202\n00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.410\nSo you might have a binder\nlibrary that's out there,\n\n203\n00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.680\nwhere somebody can actually\npull off those projects.\n\n204\n00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.862\nHow are they actually stored in there and\neverything.\n\n205\n00:11:09.862 --> 00:11:14.030\nAnd that way any other project managers\ncan go back in and review those projects.\n\n206\n00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.320\nAnd see if it actually helps them\nalong in a current project as well.\n\n207\n00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.180\nToday though,\n\n208\n00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:22.150\nmore than likely the most popular method\nis some type of electronic archiving.\n\n209\n00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.530\nBy far,\nit's probably gonna be much easier for\n\n210\n00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.560\nyou to gain access to stuff like this\nas long as it's stored somewhere.\n\n211\n00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.990\nThe nice thing about the electronic\narchive, it doesn't take up any space and\n\n212\n00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.800\nthere's redundancy.\n\n213\n00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.560\nIn other words,\nbackups to those electronic archives,\n\n214\n00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.860\nyou don't have to worry about anything\nburning down or getting lost.\n\n215\n00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.301\nIt's actually gonna be up there somewhere,\nsomehow.\n\n216\n00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:47.020\nAnd so you now have a historical close\nout of your project, a historical record.\n\n217\n00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:50.830\nNow people can actually use that as\na beginning and a base for learning and\n\n218\n00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.990\nactually figuring out how to\ndo other projects better.\n\n219\n00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:57.460\nSo there is a great reason\nto actually go back and\n\n220\n00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.830\ndo the entirety of\nthe formal process of this.\n\n221\n00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:04.819\nAnd that closing is actually a big\none where you actually do establish\n\n222\n00:12:04.819 --> 00:12:07.928\nformalities of how you\nactually release resources.\n\n223\n00:12:07.928 --> 00:12:11.025\nYou know where is the project sign off\ngonna happen, is it gonna be a big\n\n224\n00:12:11.025 --> 00:12:14.340\nceremony or is it just something small,\nwhatever it might be?\n\n225\n00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.878\nYou know, what is the official\ntransfer of these operations?\n\n226\n00:12:16.878 --> 00:12:21.250\nThese are the things that you have planned\nout in the closing plan itself, but\n\n227\n00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.290\nthis is just part of that process here.\n\n228\n00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:28.730\nSo, that's kind of one of the big things\nthat we do find in the closing phase, or\n\n229\n00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.510\nthe closing stage of our project itself.\n\n230\n00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:36.940\nNow even though this is actually doing\nthat, we wanna focus in on this idea\n\n231\n00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:41.600\nof documents a little bit more and\nof the idea of procurements, too.\n\n232\n00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.285\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at that one,\n\n233\n00:12:45.285 --> 00:12:49.090\nwhen I said that there's\nreally two phases here, okay?\n\n234\n00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.280\nThe other one that's incredibly important,\n\n235\n00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.630\nright, is to ensure that we do\nclose out our procurements.\n\n236\n00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:59.630\nWe don't want somebody being able to\nattach something later on legally\n\n237\n00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.850\nto our project, okay?\n\n238\n00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.520\nAnd say, no, I'm still actually working\nunderneath the charter of this project.\n\n239\n00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.320\nYou don't want that, okay?\n\n240\n00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:12.310\nSo closing out a procurement essentially\nis making sure that your contracts, right?\n\n241\n00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:17.050\nThat you did do everything according to\nyour contract that you had with anybody.\n\n242\n00:13:18.375 --> 00:13:23.320\nNow I am no legal expert, I don't\neven play one on TV, so [LAUGH] so I\n\n243\n00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.110\ncan't even tell you how to do that, but I\nwill tell you something here, that really\n\n244\n00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:31.080\nyou have to do and everybody in your legal\noffice is actually gonna do as well.\n\n245\n00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.480\nBoth sides, whatever the work is agreed\nto, they're gonna go through and\n\n246\n00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.610\nverify that it was agreed to and\nthat it was actually done.\n\n247\n00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.770\nIf it's not done, they need to know about.\n\n248\n00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.940\nSo, in other words, if you use them for\n\n249\n00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.960\n80% and whatever it might be,\nas long as it's agreed to you're fine.\n\n250\n00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.120\nBut now if there's some of the portion of\nthe contract that didn't get fulfilled,\n\n251\n00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.660\nwell, somebody needs to know about it.\n\n252\n00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.490\nSo going back through those contracts,\n\n253\n00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:57.450\nmaking sure you're settling the terms\nof the contract is key here.\n\n254\n00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:00.970\nIf it's unsettled you cannot close\nout the project, you cannot.\n\n255\n00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.820\nYour project,\neven though no work will be done, and\n\n256\n00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:07.780\neven though you're not expending any money\non anything that's actually producing\n\n257\n00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.190\nanything, you might find\nyourself in a long drawn out\n\n258\n00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.030\nlegal situation that will\ncontinue to expend money.\n\n259\n00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.880\n>> Yeah,\nRonnie as we're looking at this I thought,\n\n260\n00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.660\nusually this is where\nthe legal teams get involved.\n\n261\n00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.470\nAnd contracts are their specialty,\nit's not our specialty.\n\n262\n00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.280\nWe're project managers, we're tech people.\n\n263\n00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.260\nWe're whoever you are, unless you're\nsitting out there and you're a lawyer and\n\n264\n00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.930\nyou're getting Project+ certified.\n\n265\n00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.740\nMost of us are not, we're not lawyers.\n\n266\n00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.730\nWe don't understand\nthe contract portion of it.\n\n267\n00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:36.990\nAll I know is that I need to have\nBob's Building Company come in and\n\n268\n00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.290\nperform concrete pouring for\n\n269\n00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.820\nthis project, cuz we don't have\nan in-house shop that does that.\n\n270\n00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.280\nSo I can whip up a contract,\nI have my lawyers whip up a contract,\n\n271\n00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.490\ntheir lawyers sign it and\nthen we agree to that.\n\n272\n00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.770\nSo if any kind of thing that happens,\nusually this is going to the legal teams,\n\n273\n00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:56.050\nthey're gonna hash out, figure it out,\nwhat's gonna be the best benefit for\n\n274\n00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:57.061\nall parties involved.\n\n275\n00:14:57.061 --> 00:14:58.761\nAnd they're going to\nfigure out if they can't,\n\n276\n00:14:58.761 --> 00:15:00.544\nthen it's going to go to\nsome sort of litigation and\n\n277\n00:15:00.544 --> 00:15:02.750\na judge will do it for them and\nthen you'll come to the end of it.\n\n278\n00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.380\nBut as far as you're concerned you\njust need to make sure that you\n\n279\n00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:09.320\nget those things closed out, that both\nparties are satisfied with the work that\n\n280\n00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.530\nwas performed, and\nthat the compensation paid out.\n\n281\n00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:16.210\nAnd the contracts are fulfilled\nin a certain way.\n\n282\n00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:16.780\n>> Right and\n\n283\n00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:22.510\nthat is beyond anything else that we do\nbecause of those legal ramifications.\n\n284\n00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:26.290\nSo just kind of be aware that this is\nactually something that's very important.\n\n285\n00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:30.280\nIt could be that you're actually holding\nout closing the contract because\n\n286\n00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.670\nyou're still expecting\nsome work to be done.\n\n287\n00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:35.090\nIn that sense, that actually allows\nthen at the end of the month for\n\n288\n00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:38.230\nthat project management office\nto audit and say all right,\n\n289\n00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:42.300\nit says that we're 100% complete on\nthe work, but why is this one still open?\n\n290\n00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:46.980\nAnd then they go back and they find out\nthat there is still this idea of some last\n\n291\n00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.730\nminute details or some things that weren't\nturned in the way that they needed to.\n\n292\n00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.520\nAnd you as a project manager have not yet\n\n293\n00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:56.860\nsigned off on saying that that work was\nactually done to your satisfaction, or\n\n294\n00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.340\nthat your work wasn't done to\nthat satisfaction as well.\n\n295\n00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.212\nSo you gotta actually realize that too.\n\n296\n00:16:01.212 --> 00:16:02.138\nAlso at the end here,\n\n297\n00:16:02.138 --> 00:16:05.129\nyou update all of your records that\nyou also had as a project manager.\n\n298\n00:16:05.129 --> 00:16:08.546\nNow you may be the one signing\nthe contract, you may not.\n\n299\n00:16:08.546 --> 00:16:11.791\nBut just kind of realise that\nyou also will get a copy of it,\n\n300\n00:16:11.791 --> 00:16:16.090\nmake sure you actually archive them for\nthe future as well okay?\n\n301\n00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:20.460\nNow the other phase that we have to\nthink about in our project closure here\n\n302\n00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.270\nis what we call\na post-project review okay?\n\n303\n00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:26.360\nSo just doing the stuff\nthat we talked about,\n\n304\n00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:32.660\nabsolutely is kind of the big majority of\nwhat we talk about here in the closure.\n\n305\n00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.950\nBut overall though, at the end,\n\n306\n00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:38.860\nwe want to make sure we perform some type\nof post-mortem or a post project review.\n\n307\n00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:39.740\nAll right, so\n\n308\n00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:44.610\none of the last things we have to do here\nis what we call the administrative review,\n\n309\n00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:48.910\nand the post mortem, the post,\nproject review here, this is part of what\n\n310\n00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.560\nwe call that administrative closure,\nnow what does that mean?\n\n311\n00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.030\nThat means at this point, that we're\nsaying, we are finally completing all\n\n312\n00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:01.000\nthe details and the paperwork,\nI know that that sounds strange, right?\n\n313\n00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.960\nWe've done all the work,\nwe've done the planning,\n\n314\n00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.910\nwe've done the pre-planning,\nwe've done everything.\n\n315\n00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:08.441\nWe've actually gotten the work done,\nwe've monitored, we've controlled, and\n\n316\n00:17:08.441 --> 00:17:13.190\nthere's still paperwork,\nthat's the reality of things.\n\n317\n00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:17.410\nThe post mortem review is actually\nsaying after the project has now really\n\n318\n00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:20.030\ncompletely ceased its working.\n\n319\n00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:23.780\nWe want to make sure that as we review\nthings that we keep some things in mind\n\n320\n00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.740\nfor the future as well, okay?\n\n321\n00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:29.740\nIt allows us at the meeting to review what\nwent right and what went wrong, okay?\n\n322\n00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.300\nAnd this is very important, because\nwhat we wanna do is we want to take\n\n323\n00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.880\nthe pre-planning phase and\nwanna review that.\n\n324\n00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.300\nAnd verify that, hey here's what we\ndid right, here's what we did wrong.\n\n325\n00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.950\nSame thing as we move into the planning,\nexecution, monitoring and controlling, and\n\n326\n00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:47.140\nnot the closing, but all four of those\nwe wanna make sure that we do, okay?\n\n327\n00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:51.990\nSo that's a big part of what\nwe wanna do because later on,\n\n328\n00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:56.200\nthere's other project managers that\ncan actually learn from what you did.\n\n329\n00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:01.350\nIf the project closes out in a different\nway than just a full functioning project,\n\n330\n00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:04.800\nsometimes projects get canceled, sometimes\nprojects just get left behind and\n\n331\n00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.190\nwe'll talk about that in\na future episode here.\n\n332\n00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:10.480\nBut when you start taking a look at\nthis right you can now go ahead and\n\n333\n00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.822\npick up a project whether it's\nbeen half way done or abandon and\n\n334\n00:18:13.822 --> 00:18:15.710\nsome things end up happening here.\n\n335\n00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:19.200\nAnd you can actually now figure out,\nwhy did that project get abandoned?\n\n336\n00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:22.840\nThe reason why is that you might now\nbe assigned as a project manager\n\n337\n00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.960\nto actually say this is really\n\n338\n00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:31.050\nrevision two of that earlier project that\ngot abandoned and now you're saying, okay.\n\n339\n00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:34.310\nI'm picking it up but\nwhy did the first one get abandoned?\n\n340\n00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:35.470\nNow six months later,\n\n341\n00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:40.510\na year later, three years later,\npeople are going, I don't remember why.\n\n342\n00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.730\nWell, if you have documentation,\nguess what?\n\n343\n00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:47.770\nYou can actually go back and go, okay,\nand actually use that now in the future.\n\n344\n00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:51.070\nThe other thing you also want to do\nis what's officially called lessons\n\n345\n00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:52.620\nlearned here.\n\n346\n00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:56.180\nMake sure you mark the successes and\nfailures of the project, it's actually\n\n347\n00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:01.050\nfairly understandable, if you do have\ncorrective action that had to be done,\n\n348\n00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:05.800\nmake sure you actually know what actions\nthey were, and the outcome of this.\n\n349\n00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.300\nIt's very easy to say, I needed to make a\ncorrection here, and then never mention it\n\n350\n00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:14.180\nagain, express why, and then actually tell\nthem what the outcome was if you did that.\n\n351\n00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:18.380\nAlso, especially large performance\nvariances that happen, in other words,\n\n352\n00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.070\nthe things that really did take\nyour project off course, and\n\n353\n00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:24.890\nalso what got you back on course as well,\nunplanned risk.\n\n354\n00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:28.230\nNow in your risk register you should\nhave every risk that you came across or\n\n355\n00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:31.850\nevery risk that you're expecting to, that\ndoesn't mean you accounted for everything.\n\n356\n00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:32.410\nOkay?\n\n357\n00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.580\nSo make sure that you note the ones\nthat you just missed here.\n\n358\n00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:39.600\nMistakes, this is the one that most of the\ntime when we talk about lessons learned,\n\n359\n00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:43.650\nbelieve it or not right here at the end,\nthis last one here.\n\n360\n00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:48.810\nThis is incredibly important, but\na lot of Project Managers fail to do it,\n\n361\n00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:53.030\nbecause sometimes,\nespecially when it comes down to mistakes,\n\n362\n00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:56.390\nmistakes boil down to somebody\nneeding to take responsibility.\n\n363\n00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:59.390\nAnd nobody wants to attach\nRonnie Wong to this mistake,\n\n364\n00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:02.380\nespecially Ronnie Wong, he doesn't wanna\nattach that to a particular mistake.\n\n365\n00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.436\n>> Now Ronnie-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n366\n00:20:03.436 --> 00:20:05.296\n>> If the project is over and done with,\n\n367\n00:20:05.296 --> 00:20:08.420\nand it's all closed up why would\nwe do any of this, really?\n\n368\n00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.690\n>> Yeah, you would think that that's it,\nbut the idea is that,\n\n369\n00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:15.810\nthe project manager is saying, look, it's\nnot that it's so important that we know\n\n370\n00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:19.525\nwho made a mistake, unless we're about\nto hire him to do a project, I guess.\n\n371\n00:20:19.525 --> 00:20:23.760\n[LAUGH] But it's about the idea that we\ncan learn from one another as a community\n\n372\n00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.620\nand what you do want to do here\nis to make sure that you do know.\n\n373\n00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:30.550\nCertain mistakes were made if you\nactually did make major mistakes that\n\n374\n00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.290\ncaused your project to\nkind of really veer off.\n\n375\n00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:38.180\nBut most us would rather not attach any\none person's name especially your own\n\n376\n00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.490\nto those mistakes.\n\n377\n00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:41.940\nBut they should be noted\nbecause it's not that you're,\n\n378\n00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.150\nlike I said it's not the idea of assigning\nblame now that everything is done.\n\n379\n00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:49.710\nIt's the idea of actually making sure you\nnote those mistakes, so most of the time,\n\n380\n00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:50.760\nproject managers are busy.\n\n381\n00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.200\nIn other words, they're actually\nlined up one project after the other,\n\n382\n00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.070\nif there's any part of the closure that\ndoesn't get done, it's right here.\n\n383\n00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.949\n>> So this really boils down to,\nit's all about posterity,\n\n384\n00:20:58.949 --> 00:21:02.675\nit's all about the people that are coming\nafter you to do another project.\n\n385\n00:21:02.675 --> 00:21:05.255\nThey're going to learn from what\nyou learned on your project,\n\n386\n00:21:05.255 --> 00:21:06.870\nthat's why we document these things.\n\n387\n00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.475\nI love the old quote, and\nI'm probably gonna butcher it, but it's,\n\n388\n00:21:09.475 --> 00:21:12.171\nif you see farther than other people\ndo it's because you're standing on\n\n389\n00:21:12.171 --> 00:21:13.473\nthe shoulders of giants, right?\n\n390\n00:21:13.473 --> 00:21:16.977\nYou're standing on the foundation\nthat has been laid before you and\n\n391\n00:21:16.977 --> 00:21:20.870\nyou're building a foundation for\nthe people that are coming after you.\n\n392\n00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:26.740\nIf for that reason only that is the best\nreason to actually document these things.\n\n393\n00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.500\nFigure out what you can\nfigure out from it,\n\n394\n00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.660\nlearn from the mistakes that were made.\n\n395\n00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.520\nAnd if there is blame to be\nassigned that's fine at least you\n\n396\n00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:35.140\nlearned something.\n\n397\n00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.060\nOur boss Tim used to say,\nright, wrong or indifferent,\n\n398\n00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:41.580\nmake a decision,\nyou're gonna learn something.\n\n399\n00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.583\nIf you're wrong you'll learn something, if\nyou're right you'll learn something, and\n\n400\n00:21:44.583 --> 00:21:47.157\nthat's basically the idea we're trying\nto convey when it comes to this type of\n\n401\n00:21:47.157 --> 00:21:47.752\ndocumentation.\n\n402\n00:21:47.752 --> 00:21:50.562\n>> Right, and our last one here\nis just strengths and weaknesses,\n\n403\n00:21:50.562 --> 00:21:54.200\nnow, we tend to do this,\nin other words a short performance review.\n\n404\n00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:58.100\nUsually, of course, the performance\nreview is of the team as well, okay?\n\n405\n00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.970\nBut notice that also you can put\nyour own performance review,\n\n406\n00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:03.150\nif you're actually willing to do that.\n\n407\n00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.380\nMost of us would always\neither give ourselves an A or\n\n408\n00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.890\nactually say where we failed most often.\n\n409\n00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:12.920\nA lot of times we're more critical\nthan most people are of us, so\n\n410\n00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.370\nit's not always one of those\nthings that we like to do.\n\n411\n00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.280\nI know I don't like giving myself\na performance rating or review at all, but\n\n412\n00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.761\nyou know the very [CROSSTALK]\n>> A flaming narcissist.\n\n413\n00:22:21.761 --> 00:22:22.390\n>> There you go.\n\n414\n00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:23.850\n>> So I have no problems [LAUGHTER]\n>> If you haven't got a problem\n\n415\n00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:25.000\nwith it that's fine.\n\n416\n00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.935\nBut just realize that not everyone\nwill actually agree with you,\n\n417\n00:22:26.935 --> 00:22:28.930\n[LAUGH] when they review this.\n\n418\n00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.140\nSo just realize that\nstuff does go in there,\n\n419\n00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.980\nand that's what we wanna have\nfrom the lessons learned right?\n\n420\n00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.500\nIf you do have another project coming up,\nor somebody else does, and\n\n421\n00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.430\nthey go, Ronnie, why don't you tell\nme about the team that you had for\n\n422\n00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:42.870\nthis because it looks like I'm gonna do\nsomething preferably similar over here.\n\n423\n00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:46.100\nWould you get these people again\nthat you were able to call together?\n\n424\n00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.160\nWell, this is actually a great place\nwithout you having to go, well,\n\n425\n00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.890\nyou know I can tell you that it was pretty\ngood except for that Daniel guy, and now.\n\n426\n00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:54.931\n>> He's a flaming narcissist.\n\n427\n00:22:54.931 --> 00:22:55.512\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n428\n00:22:55.512 --> 00:22:58.062\ninstead what you can do is point\nthem towards the lessons learned and\n\n429\n00:22:58.062 --> 00:22:59.760\nthen they can read about it right there.\n\n430\n00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:04.150\nWithout having to kinda get you to recall\nthat in your memory, I know your memory is\n\n431\n00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:07.622\nperfect Daniel but unlike mine,\nmine may embellish a little bit over time.\n\n432\n00:23:07.622 --> 00:23:09.897\n[LAUGH]\n>> Mine is without error in all\n\n433\n00:23:09.897 --> 00:23:11.317\nways,shapes, and forms.\n\n434\n00:23:11.317 --> 00:23:12.500\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n435\n00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.290\n>> These are jokes everyone [LAUGH].\n\n436\n00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.330\n>> Yeah, yeah, you do have to\nmake sure that all that's done.\n\n437\n00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:20.740\nSo lessons learned, making sure that\nwe follow those close out procedures,\n\n438\n00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.750\nmaking sure that we understand\nthat the procurement closeout and\n\n439\n00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:28.840\neverything we're doing, we're essentially\ncutting off all extended purchases and\n\n440\n00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.280\neverything else too, and\nthen of course lessons learned.\n\n441\n00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.280\nAnd finally we want to make sure that\nwe actually do create what we call some\n\n442\n00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:40.010\ntype of closeout report, and\nthis is your final report,\n\n443\n00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.560\nassessing the overall\nproject is what you want.\n\n444\n00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.680\nNow, when you have this particular\nfinal report, the key here, okay?\n\n445\n00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.120\nIs once you prepare that closeout report,\nyou distributed all the product\n\n446\n00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:55.820\nstakeholders but look, only after they\naccept and sign off on the project.\n\n447\n00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.699\nYou don't give them assessment before\nthey're willing to sign off on it and,\n\n448\n00:23:59.699 --> 00:24:01.129\nthat is the key here, okay?\n\n449\n00:24:01.129 --> 00:24:03.450\nYou go, all right,\nthe project is done here and\n\n450\n00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:07.005\nwe will give you the overall report of\nthe project when you sign off on it.\n\n451\n00:24:07.005 --> 00:24:11.303\nWe don't want this to be held over,\nand say, here it is,\n\n452\n00:24:11.303 --> 00:24:13.282\nyou mean you only do this?\n\n453\n00:24:13.282 --> 00:24:13.996\nYou only did this?\n\n454\n00:24:13.996 --> 00:24:17.180\nNope, you wanna make sure that they\nsigned off on it at the end here.\n\n455\n00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.540\nNormally what's actually\nincluded in this overall report,\n\n456\n00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:20.870\na review of the goals, of course,\n\n457\n00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:25.400\nthat you started off with, remember that\nthe change during this entire time, right?\n\n458\n00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.410\nThe scope requirements might have\nchanged over a period of time,\n\n459\n00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:32.828\nmake sure you not where you actually\nbegan with and where you ended up, okay?\n\n460\n00:24:32.828 --> 00:24:37.100\nAlso the project's acceptance statement,\nin other words the charter that\n\n461\n00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:41.580\nwas actually approved here, or\nyou might find out something else too.\n\n462\n00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:46.870\nThat even if you actually presented a\nproject during the project initiation and\n\n463\n00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.230\nit got turned down for approval.\n\n464\n00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:54.670\nThe recommendation is that you still\ngo through a closing at that particular\n\n465\n00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:58.390\npoint, and saying are you insane that\nI would actually go through this and\n\n466\n00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:59.510\ndocument that?\n\n467\n00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:04.600\nNo it really is cuz you wanna figure out\none of the reason why that project was\n\n468\n00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:09.060\nactually rejected, and that way there's at\nleast a single paged document that says\n\n469\n00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:12.970\nhere's why this project was actually\nrejected here, and you're closing out.\n\n470\n00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:16.480\nThe fact that that project that was\nrejected is actually even there, okay?\n\n471\n00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.700\nIf you do expend money,\n\n472\n00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.860\nmake sure they have an overall cost\nsummation here, schedule overview,\n\n473\n00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:24.175\nyou have to present everything, but\nmake sure they can see a timeline.\n\n474\n00:25:24.175 --> 00:25:27.622\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I'm sorry to interrupt you but\n\n475\n00:25:27.622 --> 00:25:30.870\nwith that schedule do you include\nthe initial projected schedule and\n\n476\n00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:33.580\nthen the actual schedule or\njust the actual schedule?\n\n477\n00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.800\n>> Well it depends on what\nyou have available, right?\n\n478\n00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.480\nSo, in other words, if you have\nthe ability, right, to do something like\n\n479\n00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.300\na Gantt chart by using one of those\nproject management information systems,\n\n480\n00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:47.040\nyou can actually present both and\nthen they can compare it if they chose to.\n\n481\n00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:52.150\nBut if you only have a timeline in which\nyou actually been able to draw out or\n\n482\n00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:56.370\nwhatever, make sure you just actually note\nthe timeline itself as far as the overall\n\n483\n00:25:56.370 --> 00:26:01.410\nduration, and where these\nimportant times took place here.\n\n484\n00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:06.200\nAnd so, it actually is doing everything,\nso the entire closing procedure\n\n485\n00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:11.270\nwill essentially be learned and summed up\nright here in this project report as well.\n\n486\n00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:14.710\nSo the whole thing thus in\nthe producing a document for us and\n\n487\n00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:19.470\nthat now becomes the ending\nthat very last piece for\n\n488\n00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:23.460\nour project closing procedure that we\nhave that we have to actually follow.\n\n489\n00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:24.870\nSo it is important?\n\n490\n00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:28.340\nYes if we wanna actually make sure that\nour project helps another project manager\n\n491\n00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.630\nout and they can learn from the future.\n\n492\n00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.360\nIs it important because\nthere's legal ramifications\n\n493\n00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.740\nthat are attached to our project?\n\n494\n00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:39.050\nYes, is it important because there's stuff\nthat we need to make sure at least our\n\n495\n00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:40.230\nteam members know?\n\n496\n00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:42.960\nThey're ready to go out into the world and\ndo whatever they need to?\n\n497\n00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:43.730\nYeah.\nSo\n\n498\n00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:47.000\nanything that you can do to follow\nthe closing procedure is really\n\n499\n00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.230\na recommendation my all project managers\nbecause they believe they can learn\n\n500\n00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:55.410\nanything from your project regardless\nof whether it's a complete success or\n\n501\n00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:58.940\nnot a complete success, so\ntake the time to do the project closing.\n\n502\n00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.886\n>> Yeah.\nRonnie that sound like that fact that\n\n503\n00:27:00.886 --> 00:27:04.309\ndepending on the size of the project, it\ncould be a project in it of itself to do\n\n504\n00:27:04.309 --> 00:27:06.859\nthe project closure,\nthat's a lot of saying projects.\n\n505\n00:27:06.859 --> 00:27:09.235\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you do see the importance of having\n\n506\n00:27:09.235 --> 00:27:13.760\nto document everything that was done,\nyeah, it was a little bit of work.\n\n507\n00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.420\nYou do have to go through all\nthe rigmarole, fill out forms,\n\n508\n00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:20.970\ndocumentation procedures, interview sign\noffs, but they are very very important.\n\n509\n00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:25.280\nBecause we wanna put an official\nstamp of closure on our projects and\n\n510\n00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:28.120\nthis is how we get that done, Ronnie,\nyou've done a great job of overviewing\n\n511\n00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.920\nthis for us, we appreciate your\ninsight on that very topic, but\n\n512\n00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.075\nit looks like we've come to yet\na close of another.\n\n513\n00:27:33.075 --> 00:27:34.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> ITProTV episode.\n\n514\n00:27:34.450 -->

to\nanother exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.720\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.280\nAnd today's episode we are moving\nforward with our Project Plus series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.050\nJoining us back in the studio again\ntoday to help in that endeavor\n\n7\n00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.390\nnone other than our good friend and\nmentor, Mr. Ronnie Long.\n\n8\n00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.470\nRonnie, welcome back sir.\n\n9\n00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.420\n>> Well thank you again for\n\n10\n00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.850\nhaving me on the show as we\ncontinue on in our of Project+.\n\n11\n00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.960\nToday we're taking a look at some\nof the different ways in which\n\n12\n00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.210\nprojects will essentially close.\n\n13\n00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.820\nNow, we've talked about\nthe idea of the close-out\n\n14\n00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.670\nprocedures that we need to do and\nthe process itself and\n\n15\n00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.890\nhow important it is that we bring it\nthrough a formalized process, but\n\n16\n00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.410\nsometimes projects don't close exactly\nlike what we'd like them to be.\n\n17\n00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.130\nSo in other words, not everything\nactually works in the same day that we've\n\n18\n00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.370\nactually said because life takes place,\nand that means\n\n19\n00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.220\nyou will actually get a lot of different\nways in which projects will close.\n\n20\n00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.040\nAnd we need to take a look at some of\nthose different scenarios in which they\n\n21\n00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.910\ncan close.\n\n22\n00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.650\nAnd we can actually describe\nthem in four different ways.\n\n23\n00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.990\nBut before we actually do that then,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n24\n00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.450\ntalk about the project closing\nsteps again just as a review and\n\n25\n00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.950\nto remind ourselves of a few different\nthings when we start talking about closing\n\n26\n00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.680\nout a project and then we'll take a look\nat those four scenarios here, okay?\n\n27\n00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.740\nSo, one my computer here, okay, good,\nwe've actually brought it up, ready?\n\n28\n00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.840\nWhen we take a look here,\nthere's multiple steps and\n\n29\n00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.570\nwe've gone through these again in another\nepisodes, so this is a great review for us\n\n30\n00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.430\nbecause it's gonna show us something that\nwe need to remind ourselves of too, okay?\n\n31\n00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.250\nSo remember that when we're closing out\nof the project we normally do sign-off\n\n32\n00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.630\nat that point, and we hand off\nthe project over to our operations.\n\n33\n00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.410\nWe release our resources, allowing them\nto actually go their way and do other\n\n34\n00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.500\nprojects that we need to or saying they're\nnot committed to our project any more.\n\n35\n00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.150\nWe take a look at those contracts and\nthose procurement phases and we go ahead\n\n36\n00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.720\nand close those out as well, verifying\nthat we're satisfied with the work.\n\n37\n00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.730\nWe do the administrative\nclosure which allows us\n\n38\n00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.820\nthen to begin to document\nthe historical information.\n\n39\n00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.800\nWe take actually to do a review, when we\nactually go and ask what was good and\n\n40\n00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.510\nwhat was bad in our project.\n\n41\n00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.420\nWe go ahead and then do our post project\nreview again in which we're saying,\n\n42\n00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.120\nall right here's the finalization where\nwe bring all those documents together and\n\n43\n00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.780\nwe actually end up creating a report out\nof that along with the lessons learned.\n\n44\n00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.790\nSo taking a look at all those elements you\nmight think well okay that actually closes\n\n45\n00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.020\nout the entire project and that's all we\never have to worry about so we shouldn't\n\n46\n00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.170\nactually have to worry about anything\nelse, but the reality is though when we\n\n47\n00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.400\nactually are working with our project\nwe are actually doing closeouts, okay,\n\n48\n00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.560\nor project closer's at a lot of different\npoints throughout our entire project.\n\n49\n00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.640\nSo at the bottom here,\n\n50\n00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.120\nI actually said that some of the closing\nsteps are used when completing phases,\n\n51\n00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.620\nstages, work packages too and\nnot just at the end of the project.\n\n52\n00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.560\nSo you're probably saying, Matt,\nwhat the heck does that mean?\n\n53\n00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.350\nThat they're actually\ncompleted during phases?\n\n54\n00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.410\nWell let me try to show you\na little bit more graphically.\n\n55\n00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.300\nAs well.\n\n56\n00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.580\nNow I've also mentioned this in previous\nepisodes before but I think this is\n\n57\n00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.660\nprobably the better graphic that\nI've actually created for this.\n\n58\n00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.490\nRemember that what can also\nhappen when we describe\n\n59\n00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.540\nthe idea moving through the phases\nsuch as the project initiation, right.\n\n60\n00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.830\nAnd then going into the planning phase.\n\n61\n00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.730\nThat what we said is at the end\nof that initiation phase where we\n\n62\n00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.550\nget the project charter.\n\n63\n00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.300\nWell that essentially closes off\nthe initiation phase at that point.\n\n64\n00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.000\nAnd says that we are also\nready then to begin well,\n\n65\n00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.390\nthe planning phase as well, okay?\n\n66\n00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.140\nSo when we switch from\none phase to another,\n\n67\n00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.040\nwe may find out that what we might do\nat that point before we actually go on.\n\n68\n00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.280\nIs actually we'll get somebody to sign off\nand that was like the project charter that\n\n69\n00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.990\nwe talked about and we're transferring it\nnot to operations but we're saying what?\n\n70\n00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.880\nWe're ready to begin\nthe planning phase and\n\n71\n00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.300\nthen, instead of at that point we're\nreleasing invoices we're saying all right,\n\n72\n00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.220\nwho do we need to get\non this at this point.\n\n73\n00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.170\nSo there are some of these steps that\nwill actually be used throughout our\n\n74\n00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.900\nentire project that one\nI should be going to,\n\n75\n00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.850\neven though they're part of the closure,\nthat's actually closing out of a phase.\n\n76\n00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.060\nNow this can actually drill\ndown even deeper than that.\n\n77\n00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.820\nLet's say that we're actually in our\nexecution phase here in the center and\n\n78\n00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.840\nwe actually do have work\npackages task A and task B.\n\n79\n00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:42.820\nRemember that this way in which task A has\nto finish before task B begins, right?\n\n80\n00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.410\nThis is a finish to start of dependency.\n\n81\n00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:51.530\nIf I'm doing something like that,\nI can also at the end of task A.\n\n82\n00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.680\nGo ahead and\ndo some closing procedures as well.\n\n83\n00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.250\nOkay?\n\n84\n00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.840\nSo it might be that once again,\nI'm actually saying, look.\n\n85\n00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.780\nI need to sign off.\n\n86\n00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.900\nIn other words, verify that all of\ntask A is done before I transfer\n\n87\n00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.550\nthe actual operations over to or the next\nwork package over which is task B.\n\n88\n00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.420\nAnd verify that I have all my paperwork\ndone at this point that I need.\n\n89\n00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.590\nAnd that task b is now ready to begin.\n\n90\n00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.160\nSo we can actually see where that's\nactually another break down in terms of\n\n91\n00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:25.720\nclosure, and this one's more of a work\ncomponent closure as well, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.050\nAnd what we're really focusing in on,\nright,\n\n93\n00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.500\nis the idea here of\nthe entire project closure.\n\n94\n00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.460\nAnd remember that we actually do have\nthe execution which we use this bulldozer\n\n95\n00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.640\nhere is actually creating and\nknocking down stuff here.\n\n96\n00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.880\nAnd building stuff, and\nthen we have the monitoring and\n\n97\n00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.800\ncontrolling represented by this\nlittle chart here as well.\n\n98\n00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.680\nBut that last phase that we talked about,\nright?\n\n99\n00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.160\nEssentially all this stuff\ncan actually end up here.\n\n100\n00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.740\nWhere we close out of\nthe entire project again and\n\n101\n00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.280\nthis is where we might go through every\nsingle one of those components, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.030\nSo this is why there's always unusual\ncycle and break down where you have that.\n\n103\n00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.690\nSo everything that you're doing\nis constantly in this process and\n\n104\n00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.860\nyou're probably again wondering do we\nreally need to do that at every level?\n\n105\n00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.520\nWell, you don't have to do it\nat exactly every level, right?\n\n106\n00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.600\nSome of its intuitive where\nyou're- like the work components.\n\n107\n00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.660\nMost of us are probably not gonna say,\n\n108\n00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.560\nyip, check mark here; but\nyou can if you want to.\n\n109\n00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.050\nBut remember that the whole goal behind is\nnot to make it harder, but it's to make it\n\n110\n00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.540\neasier for you as a Project Manager\nto see where you can manage.\n\n111\n00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.390\nWhether we're talking about\nmoving from one phase to another.\n\n112\n00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.250\nOr whether we're talking\nabout a work package and\n\n113\n00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.440\nmanaging from that point, making sure\nthat actually A is done before B begins.\n\n114\n00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.410\nOr whether we're talking about\nending the entire project and\n\n115\n00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.410\nverifying that everything is done\nthe way that we expect it to be done.\n\n116\n00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.600\nSo yes, the entire process here, we're\nactually starting to see that closure\n\n117\n00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.800\nwould have actually mattered\nthrough our entire project.\n\n118\n00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.100\n>> Wow, that's something we have to keep\nin mind as we reach the final stages.\n\n119\n00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.670\nOf our project itself.\n\n120\n00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.630\nNow Ronnie,\n\n121\n00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:03.610\nthat being said we're kind of building\nup to this culmination point here.\n\n122\n00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.670\nWe're trying to get\nthis project completed.\n\n123\n00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.630\nThere's a couple of phases that we need\nto address before we can actually make\n\n124\n00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.460\nthat happen right?\n\n125\n00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.310\n>> There really are because the problem\nthat we have is fairly simple.\n\n126\n00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.140\nEverything that we've talked about really\nup in this point has to do with the ideal\n\n127\n00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.690\nproject.\n\n128\n00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.130\nThe very fact that we go from\ninitiation to planning to\n\n129\n00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.290\nexecution to monitoring control and\nto close out.\n\n130\n00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:28.770\nWe really haven't talked about ways\nthat real projects might actually end.\n\n131\n00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.500\nAnd why they do end is what\nwe're trying to get at.\n\n132\n00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.510\nSo there's a lot of times where\nyou might begin a project and\n\n133\n00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.180\nit just never completes.\n\n134\n00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.940\nIt happens sometimes like that and\nthere's reasons for that as well.\n\n135\n00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.280\nOne of the big reasons for that is\nsimply a cancellation of that project.\n\n136\n00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.790\nBelieve it or not it happens.\n\n137\n00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.790\nYou start off a project, you get through\nthe initiation, you get the charter.\n\n138\n00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:56.350\nAnd then you're kinda told well,\nwe've decided to put that project on hold.\n\n139\n00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.990\nWell now you're just kind of\nat a stopping point as well.\n\n140\n00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.040\nSo cancellations to\nprojects tend to happen.\n\n141\n00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.930\nNow they happen more often than not and\nthe reason why I'm saying that is because,\n\n142\n00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:11.670\nin the world that we live in today,\neverything is incredibly agile.\n\n143\n00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:15.370\nThe idea of planning out a project,\nunless it's a really big infrastructure\n\n144\n00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:19.930\nconversion process of some sort,\nis probably not gonna happen too much.\n\n145\n00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.130\nI don't wanna say too much.\n\n146\n00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.340\nNot gonna happen as often as\na lot of the smaller projects,\n\n147\n00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.680\nthat's what I wanted to say.\n\n148\n00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.440\nAnd so what ends up happening, especially\nin small projects within companies, and\n\n149\n00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.350\nthen even small construction projects,\nright?\n\n150\n00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.220\nIs that you can start, and all\nthe sudden you kinda realize something.\n\n151\n00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.930\nThat you run out of money, okay,\nand you can't go any further.\n\n152\n00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:44.550\nOr people on your team actually quit,\nand you can't do anything more.\n\n153\n00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.980\nI mean, what can you do?\n\n154\n00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.570\nSo we're gonna talk about the four\nformal ways in project management\n\n155\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.790\nthat we call the idea of these\nproject closing scenarios,\n\n156\n00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.570\nis what we wanna take a look at.\n\n157\n00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.910\nSo let's go ahead and do this as well, and\nthat way we'll kinda show you the ways\n\n158\n00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:04.350\nthat most projects will essentially end\nup ending at some point here, okay?\n\n159\n00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.050\nSo, the first one that I have listed\nhere is what's called addition.\n\n160\n00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:12.930\nNow, in this particular manner,\nthis is not exactly a lose at this point.\n\n161\n00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.970\nIn other words, we're not exactly\nsaying that we didn't do the project or\n\n162\n00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.690\nit got cancelled at some point, what we're\nsaying is that the project that we worked\n\n163\n00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:24.500\non it ended up developing into\nit's own particular ongoing\n\n164\n00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:29.620\noperations step and this stuff does\nhappen where you started trying to say,\n\n165\n00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.290\nI wonder if I can actually make this and\n\n166\n00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:35.240\nnow all of a sudden you're in the middle\nof producing it because you realized not\n\n167\n00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.120\nonly could make it You absolutely\ncould make money off of it, too.\n\n168\n00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.720\n>> So Ronnie, normally this additions,\n\n169\n00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.040\nthis closure type,\nmight not be purposeful.\n\n170\n00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.960\nIt might have just come by happenstance?\n\n171\n00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.820\n>> It can really come by\nhappenstance.or,even right at the end\n\n172\n00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.130\nof the project, itself.\n\n173\n00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.910\nWhere you're now closing out but\nthen you realize something.\n\n174\n00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.660\nThat, you've already\nimplemented it into production.\n\n175\n00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.210\nAnd instead of closing out\na project you just said let's just\n\n176\n00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:04.490\ncontinue to do what we're doing which\nis now we're producing these things.\n\n177\n00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.360\nNow we're gonna come up with\nnew innovations and stuff.\n\n178\n00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:11.000\nAnd the one that it actually\nmakes me think about is Dyson,\n\n179\n00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.970\nthe vacuum cleaner guy.\n\n180\n00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.170\nHe wanted to produce a better vacuum.\n\n181\n00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:18.370\nWell, the man produced a better vacuum but\nthat automatically led him instead of\n\n182\n00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:23.120\nselling whatever that his\ninvention is to another company,\n\n183\n00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.660\nwhatever the other vacuum\ncleaner comes out there.\n\n184\n00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:30.900\nHe said, hey I can make this into my own\nvacuum company cuz he didn't start off,\n\n185\n00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.020\nas far as I remember the commercials,\n\n186\n00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.820\nhe didn't start off wanting\nto make a vacuum company.\n\n187\n00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.150\nHe just wanted to produce a better vacuum.\n\n188\n00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.360\nAnd it led to a business.\n\n189\n00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.880\nWell that's an addition is what happens,\nright?\n\n190\n00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.350\nThe actual product or project that\nhe was on was that better vacuum and\n\n191\n00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:49.950\nthen that turned into the Dyson\nwhatever company it actually is.\n\n192\n00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:53.370\nSo you can see stuff like\nthat happening all the time.\n\n193\n00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.980\nSo there's times in which you don't' go\nthrough the close out phase too much,\n\n194\n00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.060\nbecause of that.\n\n195\n00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.620\nBut, there are some things that will\nend up happening, that are legally,\n\n196\n00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.530\nin the documentation department, that will\nend up happening, that will change that.\n\n197\n00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:07.700\nBut, overall, though,\nthis can happen in this way,\n\n198\n00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.830\nwhich is not really\na completion of a project.\n\n199\n00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:11.360\nIt just becomes it's own business here.\n\n200\n00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.640\nThe other one, of course, is something\nthat can happen to your project,\n\n201\n00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.160\nis what we call, integration\nthe integration is actually more of\n\n202\n00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.900\nan abandonment at times\nof your company as well.\n\n203\n00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.690\nNow this is, it almost sounds like what\nwe're gonna get into in starvation, but\n\n204\n00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.750\nthis one's a little bit different,\nin this sense okay.\n\n205\n00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.740\nThe resources that you would normally\nactually have for your project,\n\n206\n00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:38.220\nthey essentially get reassigned to other\nprojects or other things in the meantime.\n\n207\n00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.490\nSo let's say that you actually did\nend up starting a project, and\n\n208\n00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:46.740\nyou had everybody in line at the execution\nphase, and you were ready to go.\n\n209\n00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.580\nWell now you find out from your company\nthat another project's priority has been\n\n210\n00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:55.830\nmoved ahead of yours, and they need 80%\nof your resources to do their project.\n\n211\n00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.020\nAnd they are on a tighter\ntimeline at this point.\n\n212\n00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:03.480\nWell the just now have actually re\nassigned your particular resource now\n\n213\n00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.910\nto another project.\n\n214\n00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.500\nAnd even though it was actually temporary,\n\n215\n00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.690\nthey just said,\nno we just need this to get it started.\n\n216\n00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.510\nAll of a sudden they start and\nthey make such good progress.\n\n217\n00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:17.560\nWhat ends up happening is that your team\nends up getting integrated into another\n\n218\n00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.560\nproject.\n\n219\n00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.940\nSo sometimes,\nanother project essentially can swallow\n\n220\n00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.820\nyour current project even\nwhen you didn't mean it to.\n\n221\n00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.090\nSo what does that do to your project?\n\n222\n00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:27.550\nIt ends it effectively, right.\n\n223\n00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:31.710\nThe overall result is my\nproject's not getting done and\n\n224\n00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:34.660\nall you're doing is you're actually\njust keeping the books at this point.\n\n225\n00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.560\nSo do you need to go through and\nclose your process at this point?\n\n226\n00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.340\nProbably.\n\n227\n00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.890\nAnd you realize now that your entire\nteam now has been integrated, or\n\n228\n00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.420\na majority of them have\nbeen integrated in.\n\n229\n00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.750\nWell, then,\nyes you probably need to just go ahead and\n\n230\n00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.580\nsay, let's just close this project out.\n\n231\n00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.530\nWe can reopen a new project in the future.\n\n232\n00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:51.950\nBut that can happen as well.\n\n233\n00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.170\nOkay?\n\n234\n00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.770\nThe other one is by far the one\nthat we would like to do.\n\n235\n00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:57.840\nAnd it's kind of weird terminology here.\n\n236\n00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.770\nBut this is the terminology\nyou need to understand, right?\n\n237\n00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.270\nIt's the term extinction.\n\n238\n00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:03.600\nTo me extinction is bad.\n\n239\n00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.130\n>> The giant meteor comes and\nslams to your project.\n\n240\n00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.010\nAnd it's over right?\n\n241\n00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.850\n>> That's what exactly\nwhat you think about but\n\n242\n00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.790\nin project management terms,\nprimarily this is a good thing.\n\n243\n00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:17.280\nAnd the reason why it needs to\nactually become extinct because what?\n\n244\n00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.980\nYou actually did you project.\n\n245\n00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.700\nThe project was accepted by\nthe stakeholders at this point and\n\n246\n00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:27.230\nnow your project really has no\nother reason to be in existence.\n\n247\n00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:32.220\nAnd then from that point,\nit is the last dodo bird on the island\n\n248\n00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.160\nthat gets there, so that's the idea.\n\n249\n00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.350\nIf everything goes perfectly,\nthat's extinction.\n\n250\n00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.780\nSo we take a look at the idea\nof addition where essentially\n\n251\n00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.740\nthe project just becomes\nthe ongoing operations.\n\n252\n00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:49.090\nIntegration where your project is\nswallowed by another project and\n\n253\n00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:52.920\nit's kind of weird that we're kind\nof using these dinosaur terms here.\n\n254\n00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.850\n>> It's funny,\nwith addition I thought of evolution.\n\n255\n00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:00.960\nIt's changing in nature from being\na project to being an ongoing operation.\n\n256\n00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.240\n>> I think that's a great\nanalogy on that one.\n\n257\n00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.610\nThen there is this idea of starvation.\n\n258\n00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:11.830\nNow, starvation here is kind of weird\nbecause we really don't know why\n\n259\n00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:15.310\nIt ends up happening except\nthat it happens, and\n\n260\n00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.880\nthe reason is because this is\ngonna happen for any reason right.\n\n261\n00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.790\nResources are simply removed from\nyour project or no longer considered\n\n262\n00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.590\navailable to you, and more than likely\nwhen that happens you've ticked off\n\n263\n00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:29.920\nthe stakeholder somewhere is probably what\nhas actually ended up happening here.\n\n264\n00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.010\nNow, not always don't get me wrong and\n\n265\n00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:36.140\nbecause the reason why it's integration\nright it's essentially the same thing.\n\n266\n00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:40.780\nBut what we see is not that those\nparticular other projects need more\n\n267\n00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:45.760\nemphasis but we essentially are actually\nmoving them off of your project\n\n268\n00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.860\nto move them off of your project with\nwithholding is what we're doing.\n\n269\n00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.480\nSo somewhere along the line\nwe are actually withholding\n\n270\n00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.810\nwhereas the integration is say, well,\nlook, here's some that takes priority or\n\n271\n00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:58.530\nhere's another project that we\nreally need the resources on.\n\n272\n00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.990\nAnd that we have to rob it from you,\nthat's one thing.\n\n273\n00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:04.320\nBut the idea of starvation is simply\nwithholding the resource as well.\n\n274\n00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.220\n>> This is from vindictive stakeholders?\n\n275\n00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.410\nWhy does it occur?\n\n276\n00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.850\n>> Yeah, it can be, right.\n\n277\n00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:13.480\nSometimes what ends up happening is that\nit is something that you did kind of\n\n278\n00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.924\nmess around with someone's pond.\n\n279\n00:15:15.924 --> 00:15:19.070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Whatever you wanna do.\n\n280\n00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.460\nAnd you've really got- [CROSSTALK]\n>> Ripples in the water.\n\n281\n00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.040\n>> Yeah, you've done that.\n\n282\n00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.900\nOr it could be for one reason or\nanother, let's say this.\n\n283\n00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.730\nYour company is really having\na bad budget month and\n\n284\n00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.740\nthey've decided to lay off workers.\n\n285\n00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.450\nAnd so when those people\nare just no longer there,\n\n286\n00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.870\nthe possibility of your existence as\na project may not be there either.\n\n287\n00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.740\nAnd so even if you're in the middle\nof your project, it can happen.\n\n288\n00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:47.740\nIt can just be one day where those workers\nend up disappearing and you can't do that.\n\n289\n00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.380\nSo at that point,\nremember that if you can't have resources,\n\n290\n00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.210\nyou can't complete the requirement and\n\n291\n00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:55.420\nessentially, yes, you are left with\nan unfinished product as well.\n\n292\n00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:56.080\nOkay?\nSo\n\n293\n00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.560\nit could be that other projects\ndo end up taking precedence and\n\n294\n00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.770\nif they absolutely move it\noff of your project and\n\n295\n00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:06.360\nthey have other means available,\nwell they're doing it on purpose, right?\n\n296\n00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.700\nSo if they go no we need yours and to but\nyou have plenty of reserve go ahead and\n\n297\n00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.070\nhire your own team.\n\n298\n00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:17.360\nWell that kinda lets you know as well\nbudget cuts, key resource quits and\n\n299\n00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.270\nthat's a big one that can happen too which\nis something that's very important for\n\n300\n00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:25.080\nus, right, a lot of times on your\nteam you may find that there's really\n\n301\n00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.520\njust a handful of key people that\nreally keep everything working and\n\n302\n00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.030\ngoing and doing everything\nthat we need to do and if that\n\n303\n00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:37.650\nparticular person decides that he quits,\nit becomes a little more difficult for\n\n304\n00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:41.900\nthe team to actually coalesce and\ndo everything that needs to be done.\n\n305\n00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.610\nCan it be overcome?\n\n306\n00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:43.920\nYes okay.\n\n307\n00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.360\nAs long as you actually do\nhave a team that's willing to\n\n308\n00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.250\ncome together and do that.\n\n309\n00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.910\nBut not every team is and you might\nfind yourself as a project leader.\n\n310\n00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.450\nLike I don't know who else I would call,\n\n311\n00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:57.980\ncuz I would just call them and\neverything would be taken care of.\n\n312\n00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.830\nSo if you don't know the strengths and\n\n313\n00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.070\nthe weaknesses of your team\nit really isn't gong to help.\n\n314\n00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:05.010\nAnd so sometimes you will see that.\n\n315\n00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:07.950\nAnd I was part of an organization\nlike that where was a person that\n\n316\n00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:12.900\nthought they were the key, the pin,\nthat if that guy left, his,\n\n317\n00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.340\nif I leave,\neverybody's just gonna disperse.\n\n318\n00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.950\nThe guy left and guess what,\neverybody kinda came back together and\n\n319\n00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.880\nI believe we became a stronger\nafter that believe it or not.\n\n320\n00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.840\nSo, this stuff does end up\nhappening at a times, right?\n\n321\n00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.990\nWhere it could be, where that person does.\n\n322\n00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.440\nAnd now all of the sudden\neverybody else scatters too.\n\n323\n00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.190\nSo, you just never know what\nends up happening here.\n\n324\n00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:37.340\nBut those particular scenarios\nare usually what you'll end up seeing.\n\n325\n00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:41.930\nAs far as different ways that projects\ncan essentially end up closing.\n\n326\n00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.180\nSo not everything's always perfect, right?\n\n327\n00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:48.460\nAnd these are some of the reasons that\nyou might end up seeing and finding.\n\n328\n00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.070\nA lot of everything that we go across.\n\n329\n00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.710\nWhether we're talking about cancellations,\nor\n\n330\n00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.540\nwhether we're talking about\nabandonment of projects or.\n\n331\n00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.730\nOr the idea that you don't have\nenough resources to finish.\n\n332\n00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.350\nThey all fall in these\nparticular four categories.\n\n333\n00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.480\nAnd these are the formalized one\nCompTIA but they want you to know for\n\n334\n00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:04.310\nthe exam as well.\n\n335\n00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.890\nSo make sure you take a look at them.\n\n336\n00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:09.170\n>> That's right, and harkening\nback to someone quitting the team,\n\n337\n00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:12.470\nI've always said, listen,\neveryone's replaceable.\n\n338\n00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:16.540\nBut you might not be easily replaceable,\nso don't think we can't replace you.\n\n339\n00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.450\nWe might have a hard time doing it and\nit will be a horrible thing, but\n\n340\n00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:20.540\nit can be done.\n\n341\n00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:24.730\nSo there's always a good level\nof humility that needs to be\n\n342\n00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.600\nexpressed when you're on any team.\n\n343\n00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.650\nNo one is indispensable.\n\n344\n00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.140\nThere's always some one\nthat can replace you.\n\n345\n00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.625\nIt might no easily be done but\nit can be done.\n\n346\n00:18:32.625 --> 00:18:35.270\nRonnie, is there anything else we\nneed to cover when it comes to\n\n347\n00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:38.000\nproject closure\n>> Well just remember\n\n348\n00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.590\nthe scenarios more than anything else.\n\n349\n00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:42.270\nThat these are kind of key.\n\n350\n00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:45.190\nEvery scenario that you think about that\nyou're presented with make sure you go,\n\n351\n00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:49.370\nis this something that can be dealing with\naddition, integration, extinction, or\n\n352\n00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:51.060\nthe idea of starvation here?\n\n353\n00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.450\nThe two that are most difficult to deal\nwith of course is the idea of integration\n\n354\n00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:55.915\nand starvation.\n\n355\n00:18:55.915 --> 00:19:00.960\nBut, once you've figured that out you're\npretty much fine and get ready to face\n\n356\n00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.980\nwhatever exam that you're on, but you'll\nalso be presented with these scenarios and\n\n357\n00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:09.280\nif you keep a good as a project\nmanager on top of your project.\n\n358\n00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.300\nYou'll be of a spot when these\nthings are also happening and\n\n359\n00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:16.210\nthen either try to work around it or you\nbring your project to a close regardless\n\n360\n00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:18.530\nof the way that she ends up closing.\n\n361\n00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.920\n>> Well, Ronnie, as always,\nthank you so much for stopping by and\n\n362\n00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.910\nlending your expertise on these topics.\n\n363\n00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:24.510\nWe need that.\n\n364\n00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:26.500\nWe want to pass this project plus exam.\n\n365\n00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.440\nThat's exactly what we want for you.\n\n366\n00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:32.150\nThat being said, look's like we've come to\nthe end of another great show hopefully\n\n367\n00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:36.110\nyou've learned something and take away\na lot of knowledge, go pass that exam.\n\n368\n00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:38.230\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV,\n\n369\n00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:39.780\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n370\n00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:40.470\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n371\n00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.400\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n372\n00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.463\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:18.161\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:21.540\nin today's episode we're moving\non with our Project Plus series.\n\n5\n00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.540\nJoining us back in the studio again\ntoday to help in that very endeavor,\n\n6\n00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.960\nit's our good friend, Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n7\n00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.430\nRonnie, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.275\n>> Well thank you, as we continue on\ntaking a look at Comptia's Project Plus.\n\n9\n00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:34.980\nWe're actually taking a look at\njust a few final documents today\n\n10\n00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.110\nin the closeout procedures that we need\nto make sure that we pay attention to.\n\n11\n00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.181\nBecause in the end, it really is about\ndocumentation, finishing everything out,\n\n12\n00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:46.848\nto ensure that we actually have everything\nwe need to say that the project was\n\n13\n00:00:46.848 --> 00:00:50.205\nsuccessful or at least completely\nclosed out the way that we need to.\n\n14\n00:00:50.205 --> 00:00:54.012\nAnd we just wanna make sure that you have\na chance to see some of those documents\n\n15\n00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:56.250\nand understand what they're really about.\n\n16\n00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.810\nSo I've got a few different\nexamples of some of them.\n\n17\n00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.664\nAnd some of them we've actually already\ntaken a look at previously in other\n\n18\n00:01:02.664 --> 00:01:03.649\nepisodes as well.\n\n19\n00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.690\nSo when we start talking about some\nof the close out procedure documents,\n\n20\n00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.924\none of the things that we had talked about\nway back in the planning stage here,\n\n21\n00:01:11.924 --> 00:01:15.020\nis the idea of a project transition plan,\nright?\n\n22\n00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.490\nThat when we start talking about\ntransitioning we're moving from\n\n23\n00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.210\none particular stage in our project,\ngoing through the stages as well.\n\n24\n00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.840\nAnd normally there is a plan for\nus to do that.\n\n25\n00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.450\nSo we showed you the idea of moving from\nthe initiation phase into the planning\n\n26\n00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.640\nphase, that you normally\nhave a plan there that says,\n\n27\n00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.190\nhere's how you know\nthat everything's done.\n\n28\n00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.080\nHere's what you're\nexpecting to produce here.\n\n29\n00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.130\nAnd then you move through that.\n\n30\n00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.390\nThe same thing when you're moving\nfrom planning into execution.\n\n31\n00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.670\nYou're actually doing\nthat same thing again.\n\n32\n00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.330\nSo you normally will follow the procedures\nthat you've set up during that project\n\n33\n00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.550\ntransition phase to make sure\nthat you actually are hitting all\n\n34\n00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.230\nthe key points you want as you\nmove through everything else too.\n\n35\n00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.470\nAlso included inside of some of\nthose close out dockets, maybe, and\n\n36\n00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.125\nthis is one of these optional\ndocuments that you'll have,\n\n37\n00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:07.729\nis that you may have everybody that works\non your project to also go ahead and\n\n38\n00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.680\nfill out what we call\nevaluation forms as well.\n\n39\n00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.455\nYou might actually do an evaluation\nform where they actually evaluate you as\n\n40\n00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:21.370\na project manager, and also, you actually\ndo maybe evaluations on the individuals.\n\n41\n00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.220\nNow, it doesn't always\nhave to be that way.\n\n42\n00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.030\nIt may be instead where, well yes, you\nevaluate that contractor who might have\n\n43\n00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.780\na team of people or that department and\nthey may have a team.\n\n44\n00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.046\nBut normally that's what you're looking\nfor as well, is that everybody has\n\n45\n00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:39.341\na chance to have some input in\nto the closure of that as well.\n\n46\n00:02:39.341 --> 00:02:42.664\nAnd those evaluations are gonna be\ndependent upon what type of project\n\n47\n00:02:42.664 --> 00:02:45.367\nyou're working on,\nwhat industry that you're in, and\n\n48\n00:02:45.367 --> 00:02:48.360\nsort of specific measurements\nthat you may do there.\n\n49\n00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.720\nBut besides that, though, I wanna show\nyou just some of the other ones that we\n\n50\n00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.630\nalready talked about during our\nclosing procedures here, too, okay?\n\n51\n00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.350\nSo one of the first ones that\nwe wanna look at is this idea\n\n52\n00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.010\nof the lessons learned\ntype of documentation.\n\n53\n00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.870\nNow this can actually become very long.\n\n54\n00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.658\nIn other words, if you're good at writing.\n\n55\n00:03:07.658 --> 00:03:11.881\nIf you're really good at actually\nprose and telling the story and\n\n56\n00:03:11.881 --> 00:03:15.872\ndoing stuff like that,\nyou can weave an entire mini novella or\n\n57\n00:03:15.872 --> 00:03:19.422\n[LAUGH] whatever length of\nbook that you really want to.\n\n58\n00:03:19.422 --> 00:03:23.010\nBut most of us though, we really wanna\nget down to the meat and potatoes.\n\n59\n00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.800\nAnd the meat and\npotatoes is lessons learned, right?\n\n60\n00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.123\nIt's to actually be able\nto show the strengths and\n\n61\n00:03:28.123 --> 00:03:30.490\nweaknesses that we had in our project.\n\n62\n00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.810\nSo what you might have is a document that\nlooks something similar to this here,\n\n63\n00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.960\nwhere you're taking a look at\nthe project performance analysis.\n\n64\n00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.260\nAnd you start listing out your\nwork packages that you have.\n\n65\n00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.360\nSo like here, requirements and\ndefinition management, scope definition,\n\n66\n00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.660\ndevelopmental control, you name it\nwhen you're actually doing that.\n\n67\n00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.665\nAnd notice that we also have these\nunusual numberings here too,\n\n68\n00:03:53.665 --> 00:03:55.825\nthis idea of a legend that goes on.\n\n69\n00:03:55.825 --> 00:03:58.008\nAnd what you can do at this\nparticular point, right?\n\n70\n00:03:58.008 --> 00:04:02.026\nInstead of writing out the actual\nproject work package name itself,\n\n71\n00:04:02.026 --> 00:04:04.460\nyou might put the WBS skill in here.\n\n72\n00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.112\nOr you might actually have a code\nthat you've actually said, hey,\n\n73\n00:04:08.112 --> 00:04:11.590\nthis is actually something\nthat worked well, A1, B1, C1.\n\n74\n00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.619\nAnd that way you can actually just\ngo ahead and knock those in there.\n\n75\n00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:19.104\nAnd then in then end, you might have\na little definition that explains what\n\n76\n00:04:19.104 --> 00:04:21.680\nthese particular things are for.\n\n77\n00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.560\nSo you might even say what can be\nimproved and you go through and\n\n78\n00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.560\nyou fill that out very quickly.\n\n79\n00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.792\nAnd once you actually get through\neverything that you're actually supposed\n\n80\n00:04:30.792 --> 00:04:34.370\nto do, then on another page,\nthis is when you list those risks and\n\n81\n00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.540\nthose issues that you did not plan for.\n\n82\n00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.900\nAnd you wanna make sure you\nactually do have something here.\n\n83\n00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.380\nNow, this is actually done\nin just a small form.\n\n84\n00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.660\nBut remember,\nyou don't always have to type or\n\n85\n00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.120\nwrite actually just within that space.\n\n86\n00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.390\nYou can always take longer to\nwrite this stuff out of course\n\n87\n00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.330\nif you need more details as well.\n\n88\n00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.974\nQuality defects you've come across.\n\n89\n00:04:52.974 --> 00:04:55.640\nVendor management,\nwhether everything's been in control.\n\n90\n00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.280\nAnything else you want to add in there\nyou also include in your lessons learned\n\n91\n00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.330\nhere too.\n\n92\n00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.992\nSo we did take about lessons\nlearned a little bit more, but\n\n93\n00:05:03.992 --> 00:05:07.207\nthis is just a sample document\nof something that you\n\n94\n00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:11.428\nmight actually choose to be able to\ngo ahead and review and look at.\n\n95\n00:05:11.428 --> 00:05:13.990\nAnd you're probably wondering like, hey,\ncan we get a hold of those documents?\n\n96\n00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.223\nYou certainly can.\n\n97\n00:05:15.223 --> 00:05:19.680\nIn our show notes we'll make sure that we\ndo include links to these documents too.\n\n98\n00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.250\nYou can take them, modify them, use them,\n\n99\n00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.470\nhowever you'd like to actually use them,\nperfectly fine with us.\n\n100\n00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.680\nBut just kinda realize it's just\na sample more than anything else\n\n101\n00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.870\nwhen we start to look at it, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.732\nSo lessons learned, one of the more\nimportant ones because it's part of\n\n103\n00:05:34.732 --> 00:05:36.706\nthe historical documentation too.\n\n104\n00:05:36.706 --> 00:05:40.104\nNow, we also talked about there\nbeing a project close-out report,\n\n105\n00:05:40.104 --> 00:05:43.730\nessentially post-mortem of\neverything that we have in line.\n\n106\n00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.970\nSo, it could be another\ntemplate like this.\n\n107\n00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.960\nAnd this one has where you have\nthat initial project description,\n\n108\n00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.960\nwhere you're going over\nthe original goals, and\n\n109\n00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.150\nalso, where it might have\nchanged in terms of the scope.\n\n110\n00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.826\nAnd this gives you plenty\nof space to write it out or\n\n111\n00:05:56.826 --> 00:05:58.363\nto type it out if you need to.\n\n112\n00:05:58.363 --> 00:06:01.429\nAnd then of course,\nfrom this point, you go ahead and\n\n113\n00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:04.100\nyou do a performance summary as well.\n\n114\n00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.040\nAnd did everything actually follow through\nthe way that you wanted in terms of scope,\n\n115\n00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.770\nquality, time, cost?\n\n116\n00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.080\nThese things can actually take,\neach one, pages and\n\n117\n00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.735\npages if you choose to\ndo something like that.\n\n118\n00:06:14.735 --> 00:06:18.590\nOr if your project is actually where you\njust need summary of the information,\n\n119\n00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.450\nyou can do the same thing here.\n\n120\n00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.910\nAnd in the end, you also include in\nthose other documents along with it,\n\n121\n00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.440\nthe lessons learned, and\ncost and everything else too.\n\n122\n00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.060\nSo just realize that you have that ability\n\n123\n00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.980\nto make sure you have\nsomething that you can follow.\n\n124\n00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.189\nAnd then, I added in one more\nhere as well, and this one's not\n\n125\n00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:43.740\ntechnically in our closeout,\nas far as the project closeout overall.\n\n126\n00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.290\nBut this is part of that procurement\nclose that we also talked about,\n\n127\n00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.460\nensuring that all of our contracts\nare closed out in the way that we want to.\n\n128\n00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.870\nSo we normally include in just a little\nbit more for each particular vendor.\n\n129\n00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.030\nWe might wanna actually go ahead and\ndo an little review and\n\n130\n00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.660\ntake a look at what can be done here\nas far as their performance review.\n\n131\n00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.030\nWe also take a look\nduring the contract and\n\n132\n00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.200\nsee if there were any\nchanges that were made.\n\n133\n00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.770\nMake sure that we note\nthose along the way.\n\n134\n00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.160\nAnd of course the close-out.\n\n135\n00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.430\nDid we have any disputes?\n\n136\n00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.830\nWas everything settled\nthe way that we wanted to?\n\n137\n00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.540\nAnd in the end,\n\n138\n00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.228\nverify with that vendor that everything\nis actually the way that it needs to be.\n\n139\n00:07:20.228 --> 00:07:23.599\nAnd we sign off from that particular\nstatement and all the final payments,\n\n140\n00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:26.470\neverything's actually\ngonna be identified here.\n\n141\n00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:30.260\nSo all this ends up going into\nthe entirety at the end there of that\n\n142\n00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.180\nanalysis and that review that we have for\nthe entire closeout of the project itself.\n\n143\n00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.070\nSo when we start taking a look at that,\n\n144\n00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.880\nthat's what's normally is actually\nincluded in those things.\n\n145\n00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.920\nThe only other document\nthat we can talk about and\n\n146\n00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.630\nthis is where it becomes more personal,\nis when you do that analysis, right?\n\n147\n00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:50.200\nThat post project review of the\npost-mortem analysis, to go through every\n\n148\n00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:56.010\nsingle phase of the project here and\nactually do a very detailed kind of study.\n\n149\n00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.910\nAnd be honest with that study and\ndo an analysis of what really did work and\n\n150\n00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:01.330\nwhat didn't work here.\n\n151\n00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.410\nAnd you provide that along with it.\n\n152\n00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.440\nOnce you get that report done the way that\nyou want to, you make sure that you give\n\n153\n00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.410\nthe stakeholder a chance to actually\nbe able to have that report, but\n\n154\n00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.150\nonly after they've signed\noff on the project.\n\n155\n00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:18.520\nSo, here is just a few different examples\nof some of the documents that you're\n\n156\n00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:23.230\nlikely to actually have to encounter if\nyou're gonna be closing out of a project.\n\n157\n00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.500\nAnd if you're not sure where to\nget these you can go online and\n\n158\n00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.850\nactually find a few samples yourself.\n\n159\n00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.290\nBut a lot of times when you're working for\n\n160\n00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.870\na company, they'll probably\nhave these documents ready for\n\n161\n00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.020\nyou in your project management office so\nthat you can actually close\n\n162\n00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.640\nout the document in the format that they\nwant you to close it out with as well.\n\n163\n00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.800\nSo, make sure you take a look at all the\nresources that are available to you there.\n\n164\n00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:47.110\n>> Well, Ronnie, it seems like closing\nout a project is a lot of paperwork, but\n\n165\n00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.080\nit's very good paperwork.\n\n166\n00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.201\nIt gives us a lot of great information so\n\n167\n00:08:50.201 --> 00:08:54.845\nthat you'll see these types of documents\nthroughout your project management life.\n\n168\n00:08:54.845 --> 00:08:58.620\nAnd when you're closing out the projects,\nyou do wanna be as detailed as you can.\n\n169\n00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.590\nAgain, you probably don't wanna\nre-write Tolstov or whatever.\n\n170\n00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.013\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But definitely get in there,\n\n171\n00:09:04.013 --> 00:09:08.378\nput in the good detail that's going to\nreally lend to whoever the person is that\n\n172\n00:09:08.378 --> 00:09:10.246\ncomes behind you and reads them.\n\n173\n00:09:10.246 --> 00:09:13.567\nSo that they can get the pertinent\ninformation as quickly as possible and\n\n174\n00:09:13.567 --> 00:09:16.834\nstart assimilating that, and\ndo a better project in their future, and\n\n175\n00:09:16.834 --> 00:09:17.827\nmaybe yours as well.\n\n176\n00:09:17.827 --> 00:09:20.860\nRonnie, is there anything else that we\nneed to cover before we wrap up the show?\n\n177\n00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.350\n>> Well, when we take a look at\nthe overall idea of Project Plus, remember\n\n178\n00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:28.550\nyou're gonna pay attention to especially\nthose details as far as terminology goes.\n\n179\n00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.787\nIf you're already familiar with\nproject management, great!\n\n180\n00:09:30.787 --> 00:09:33.607\nSo what you need to do is pay attention\nto the things that are different,\n\n181\n00:09:33.607 --> 00:09:35.393\nessentially that's gonna be terminology.\n\n182\n00:09:35.393 --> 00:09:38.743\nAnd also some of the specific ways that\nthey call out some of the objectives that\n\n183\n00:09:38.743 --> 00:09:40.970\nyou're used to knowing about as well.\n\n184\n00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.971\nPay attention to the documents too.\n\n185\n00:09:42.971 --> 00:09:45.479\nMore than likely, you're gonna\nrun into more documents than what\n\n186\n00:09:45.479 --> 00:09:47.450\nwe've showed you along\nthe way in the show.\n\n187\n00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:48.890\nThere's plenty of them.\n\n188\n00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.163\nThis is not the PMP level type of\nexam that you're preparing for but\n\n189\n00:09:52.163 --> 00:09:55.390\nthere's still some documents that\nyou need to be familiar with.\n\n190\n00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.977\nAnd we've kinda showed you\nthe more important ones\n\n191\n00:09:57.977 --> 00:10:00.260\nyou'll probably run into as well.\n\n192\n00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.859\nSo, as far as the documents go,\n\n193\n00:10:01.859 --> 00:10:04.481\nthere's not anything else\nthat we need to show you.\n\n194\n00:10:04.481 --> 00:10:07.526\nBut overall though, just kinda\nremember that, as a project manager,\n\n195\n00:10:07.526 --> 00:10:10.066\nyou're gonna be filling\nout a lot of paperwork.\n\n196\n00:10:10.066 --> 00:10:13.390\nAnd that means that yes, you gotta take\nthe time to do it and make sure you fill\n\n197\n00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.150\nit our completely in the way that\nDaniel actually said it to be.\n\n198\n00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:20.940\nAnd you actually end up having a nice\nposterity that's actually left to your\n\n199\n00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:25.110\nproject and that gives somebody historical\ninformation to look back on your project.\n\n200\n00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.390\nAnd they use it to guide them in\nthe future, so it's a great place for\n\n201\n00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.380\nus to end the show.\n\n202\n00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.415\n>> All right, well Ronnie,\nthank you for joining us.\n\n203\n00:10:31.415 --> 00:10:33.353\nThank you for all the episodes\nthat you've been with us in.\n\n204\n00:10:33.353 --> 00:10:37.225\nBut I do believe, if you are watching\nthem in order this is our last episode.\n\n205\n00:10:37.225 --> 00:10:39.124\n>> It is.\n>> So, we're glad to have it done,\n\n206\n00:10:39.124 --> 00:10:40.426\nour project is complete.\n\n207\n00:10:40.426 --> 00:10:42.194\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now your project is to get\n\n208\n00:10:42.194 --> 00:10:44.540\nout there and pass that Project Plus exam.\n\n209\n00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.820\nThanks for watching today,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n210\n00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.520\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n211\n00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.375\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n212\n00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:52.117\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n213\n00:10:52.117 --> 00:10:59.609\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
