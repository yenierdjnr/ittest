00:00:13.240\nWe're talking about Querying Data\nwith Transact-SQL, with Don Pezet.\n\n4\n00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.580\nDon, tell us about Transact-SQL.\n\n5\n00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.830\nSo Transact-SQL,\n\n6\n00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.810\nit's actually an abbreviation for\nTransact Structured Query Language.\n\n7\n00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.400\nIt is a language that we\nuse to talk to databases.\n\n8\n00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.940\nSo if you have a relational database,\n\n9\n00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.480\nthere's a ton of great\ninformation in there.\n\n10\n00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.190\nYou have to be able to get it out.\n\n11\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.330\nAnd one of the most common ways\nto do that is through SQL, or\n\n12\n00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.890\nthe Structured Query Language.\n\n13\n00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.740\nWell, Transact-SQL is Microsoft's\nimplementation of SQL.\n\n14\n00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.750\nAnd it's what they use on\ntheir server products.\n\n15\n00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.662\nSo if you're using Microsoft SQL Server,\nwell, really, all the way back, or a long\n\n16\n00:00:45.662 --> 00:00:48.190\ntime, since their earliest versions of SQL\nServer, but all the way to the newer ones\n\n17\n00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.935\nlike 2016, which is what we're\ngonna be using here in this show.\n\n18\n00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:55.580\nTransact-SQL is how you're going to\ntalk to that server, so in this series,\n\n19\n00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.360\nthat's one of the things that\nwe're going to learn is,\n\n20\n00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.110\nif I've got a Microsoft SQL Server 2016,\nHow do I talk to it?\n\n21\n00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.760\nNow the cool part is that most\nof this is standards based, so\n\n22\n00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.630\nwhat you learn in this series can apply\nto SQL 2014, SQL 2012, SQL 2000, SQL 6.\n\n23\n00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.470\nI mean, it just goes way, way back.\n\n24\n00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.290\nThese languages, they haven't changed\nall that much in all these years.\n\n25\n00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.337\nNow, the way the databases optimized\ntheir performance, the way they work.\n\n26\n00:01:19.337 --> 00:01:22.415\nThe volumes of data that they can handle,\nhave gotten much larger and\n\n27\n00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:23.840\nevolved quite a bit.\n\n28\n00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.040\nBut by having a standard language,\n\n29\n00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.020\nit gives us the ability\nto do something awesome.\n\n30\n00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.130\nWhich is to learn how to talk to the\ndatabase service in a consistent manner.\n\n31\n00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.210\nAnd that's what this course is all about.\n\n32\n00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.037\n&gt;&gt; You already got me excited\nabout the whole thing, but\n\n33\n00:01:36.037 --> 00:01:37.850\nwho is this show targeted towards?\n\n34\n00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.010\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\n\n35\n00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.110\nit's really targeted to anybody who\nneeds to get data out of the database.\n\n36\n00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.218\nNow, I could kinda trim\nthat down a little bit,\n\n37\n00:01:46.218 --> 00:01:48.410\nlike if you don't really\ncare about database.\n\n38\n00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.213\nYou just want the data, there's plenty of\nthird party graphic utilities you can use.\n\n39\n00:01:52.213 --> 00:01:55.395\nThere's things like Microsoft Access\nthat gives you a little Wizard that\n\n40\n00:01:55.395 --> 00:01:58.250\nyou can walk through, but\nif you're trying to go to scale.\n\n41\n00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.390\nIf you're trying to be able to handle\nany kind of high volume transactions.\n\n42\n00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.510\nThose hand holding type programs,\nthey don't work.\n\n43\n00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.990\nWe actually have to get in and\ntalk to the database server.\n\n44\n00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.410\nBe able to get that information and\nput information in, and\n\n45\n00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.960\nthat's where SQL comes in.\n\n46\n00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.550\nSo if your job responsibility involves\nthat, this is what you want to learn.\n\n47\n00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.170\nNow what types of jobs would do that,\ndevelopers.\n\n48\n00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.740\nDevelopers often times have to store data\nfor their applications in a database.\n\n49\n00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.230\nAnd be able to get the data back out for\n\n50\n00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.570\ntheir application uses,\nso they need to know SQL.\n\n51\n00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.410\nWe also have DevOps, people that\nare standing up their own database server,\n\n52\n00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.070\nright?\n\n53\n00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.000\nThey still need to be able to talk to it.\n\n54\n00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.710\nWe also have system administrators.\n\n55\n00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.857\nIf you're a system administrator and\nyou're responsible for\n\n56\n00:02:39.857 --> 00:02:40.755\nstanding up a SQL Server.\n\n57\n00:02:40.755 --> 00:02:43.103\nWell, some people just have\nto install the server and\n\n58\n00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:45.910\nthen they turn it over to the dev team and\nthat's it.\n\n59\n00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.730\nBut more often than not,\nwe're gonna need to be able to monitor and\n\n60\n00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.870\nmaintain that database.\n\n61\n00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.720\nAnd the way we do that is\nby querying against it.\n\n62\n00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.470\nSending it commands,\nseeing how it responds,\n\n63\n00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.220\nthat's how we know it's up and active.\n\n64\n00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.270\nJust because the server's powered\non doesn't mean it's working.\n\n65\n00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.900\nWe need to know,\ncan I actually get data out of it?\n\n66\n00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.080\nSo if you fall into any of those roles,\ndeveloper, DevOps, system administrator.\n\n67\n00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.930\nOr just somebody who wants to learn\nmore about the way the databases work.\n\n68\n00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.612\nLearning SQL is a great way to find\nout how to talk to talk to it.\n\n69\n00:03:13.612 --> 00:03:15.103\nAnd learning Transact-SQL,\n\n70\n00:03:15.103 --> 00:03:18.185\nis a great way to learn how to\ntalk to Microsoft's SQL Servers.\n\n71\n00:03:18.185 --> 00:03:21.070\n&gt;&gt; Wow, that sounds fantastic, is there\na certification available for the show?\n\n72\n00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.260\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely this is actually\nthe first step in becoming like\n\n73\n00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.100\na Microsoft Certified SQL Engineer.\n\n74\n00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.360\nSo the first certification that we\nstart with is called the MCSA, and\n\n75\n00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.470\nI've got Microsoft's page pulled up here.\n\n76\n00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.930\nThe MCSA for SQL Server 2016,\nif you look at it.\n\n77\n00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.630\nThe very first course in that journey\nis right here, course number one.\n\n78\n00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.860\nIt's exam 70-761, and\nthat's what our show is being based on.\n\n79\n00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.120\nSo, in this show we're going to cover\neach of the topics that are a part of\n\n80\n00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.150\nthat exam.\n\n81\n00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.080\nSo that we can learn what we\nneed to know to go and pass it.\n\n82\n00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.986\nNow, by itself, that's not enough, but\n\n83\n00:03:54.986 --> 00:03:59.763\nif you complete the next course or\nnext exam, the 70-762 exam.\n\n84\n00:03:59.763 --> 00:04:05.620\nWhen you pas both of those,\nyou get your MCSA in SQL Server 2016.\n\n85\n00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.860\nAnd from there you can even move on and\nthere's an MCSE that you can get.\n\n86\n00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.810\nAnd there's several specializations for\n\n87\n00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.290\nbig data and cloud databases,\nand all of that.\n\n88\n00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.764\nBut they all start right here\nwith this one, with this show,\n\n89\n00:04:17.764 --> 00:04:21.560\n70-761, which is for SQL Server 2016.\n\n90\n00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.510\nBe aware that there are other ones for\nthe previous versions,\n\n91\n00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.445\nlike SQL Server 2012 and 2014.\n\n92\n00:04:26.445 --> 00:04:31.021\nThey shared a different exam, 70-741,\nif that's the one you're looking for.\n\n93\n00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:32.675\nWell, we have a whole\nseparate show film for\n\n94\n00:04:32.675 --> 00:04:34.650\nthat because there's\na different user interface.\n\n95\n00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.130\nThings look different, so\nwe filmed it specifically for that.\n\n96\n00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.830\nHere though, things look different enough,\n\n97\n00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.590\nthat we actually got the dedicated\ncourse specifically for it.\n\n98\n00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.471\nAnd that's exactly what\nwe're gonna be learning.\n\n99\n00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:48.130\n&gt;&gt; A good IT pro is always learning, and\nwhat topics are covered in this show?\n\n100\n00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.450\nAlright, well, it really all starts kinda,\nfrom a beginner's perspective.\n\n101\n00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.840\nSo what is Transact-SQL, what does it\nlook like, how do I type in the commands?\n\n102\n00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.280\nAnd then,\nonce I know how to input commands,\n\n103\n00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.190\nwhat are the commands to even use?\n\n104\n00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.043\nAnd if we drill into that exam,\nlet me pull it up here.\n\n105\n00:05:04.043 --> 00:05:06.104\nSo I'm going to pull up\nthat 70-761 exam and\n\n106\n00:05:06.104 --> 00:05:08.590\nI'll pull up the details\nhere from Microsoft.\n\n107\n00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.740\nThey basically divide\nthings into three areas,\n\n108\n00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.640\nnow in the show we divided\nit up into a lot more areas.\n\n109\n00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.460\nBecause this is, it's a lot to take\nin just in three chunks, right?\n\n110\n00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.900\nSo I think we actually divide it into,\nI can't remember, like 10 or\n\n111\n00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.080\n11 different areas.\n\n112\n00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.030\nBut when you look inside,\n\n113\n00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.340\nfirst off we start with Managing\ndata with Transact-SQL.\n\n114\n00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.850\nNotice that that's almost half the exam.\n\n115\n00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.210\nA large part of the exam is based,\njust on managing that data.\n\n116\n00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.320\nActually interacting\nwith the database server,\n\n117\n00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.790\nwhat Transact SQL is all about, right?\n\n118\n00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.120\nAnd if you break that apart you'll see\nit's things like using SELECT queries.\n\n119\n00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.414\nWhich are the most\ncommon types of queries,\n\n120\n00:05:40.414 --> 00:05:43.339\nthat's how we request\ninformation from the database.\n\n121\n00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:46.108\nHow we combine data between\ntables using joins,\n\n122\n00:05:46.108 --> 00:05:48.610\nhow we aggregate data using functions.\n\n123\n00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.460\nThat's all interacting with the database.\n\n124\n00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.900\nThen we get into doing advanced queries,\nthese are queries that not everybody uses.\n\n125\n00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.080\nThe ones up here in the first section,\neverybody uses these.\n\n126\n00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.710\nYou use these everyday,\njust going to a website,\n\n127\n00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.885\ncoming to our website and\nclicking on the course library.\n\n128\n00:06:03.885 --> 00:06:05.370\nYou're running these queries\nin the background and\n\n129\n00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.210\nyou don't even know it, right?\n\n130\n00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.060\nThese happen everyday, the advance\nqueries aren't in every day things.\n\n131\n00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.820\nThese are more like an edge case or\n\n132\n00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.660\na corner case, where you can actually\nget some great benefits by using these.\n\n133\n00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.510\nDoing things like grouping sets,\nand pivots, and unpivots.\n\n134\n00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.168\nSo you can change the data that you're\ngetting back from the database servers.\n\n135\n00:06:22.168 --> 00:06:24.820\nSo we'll get a chance to see that, that\nmakes up a smaller portion of the exam.\n\n136\n00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.070\nAnd then the smallest portion\nis right down here at the end,\n\n137\n00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.350\nprogramming databases\nby using Transact SQL.\n\n138\n00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.590\nIf you're given access to a SQL Server,\nit has nothing on it.\n\n139\n00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.900\nIt doesn't have a database, has no tables,\nhow do you get that set up?\n\n140\n00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.410\nSo we focus on the infrastructure side,\nhow do I create the database?\n\n141\n00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.280\nHow do I create the tables,\nhow do I deal with data types.\n\n142\n00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.150\nAnd actually work with that information,\ninside of those tables?\n\n143\n00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.350\nUntil we run through that process of being\nable to maintain the integrity of our data\n\n144\n00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.340\non the server.\n\n145\n00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.190\nIt's a great way to see some of\nthe neat tools that are a part\n\n146\n00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.220\nof Microsoft SQL Server.\n\n147\n00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.875\nThat set it apart from other\ncompetitors that are out there.\n\n148\n00:06:58.875 --> 00:07:00.749\nSo that's kind of a rundown of it,\n\n149\n00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:04.703\nnow do be aware that this last section\nhere where programing databases.\n\n150\n00:07:04.703 --> 00:07:07.830\nIt's not as super-crazy in depth,\nthat if you're not a developer,\n\n151\n00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:08.890\ndon't worry, right?\n\n152\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.230\nIt's something that everybody can tackle.\n\n153\n00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.073\nThere's actually another course,\nif we look down the little list here.\n\n154\n00:07:15.073 --> 00:07:18.130\nYou'll see this,\nProvisioning SQL Databases.\n\n155\n00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:22.730\nAnd that goes far more in-depth,\ninto all the different case scenarios for\n\n156\n00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:23.670\ndeploying a database.\n\n157\n00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.570\nLike doing it in the cloud or\nlocally or with replication, and\n\n158\n00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.300\nall these other crazy solutions.\n\n159\n00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.970\nAnd there is another course\nthat's out there, this one.\n\n160\n00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.970\nDeveloping SQL Data Models, and\nImplementing a SQL Data Warehouse.\n\n161\n00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:40.474\nThose two as well go far more in-depth,\nin how to get things set up.\n\n162\n00:07:40.474 --> 00:07:43.400\nSo here in 70-761 we're really\nfocusing on the bare minimum.\n\n163\n00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.724\nWhat's the minimum it takes to\nget a database up and running?\n\n164\n00:07:45.724 --> 00:07:48.830\nAnd to get a table in place and\nto be able to share some data with it?\n\n165\n00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.200\nBut those are the topics that we're\ngonna be covering as we move the course.\n\n166\n00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.610\nSo by the time we're done, you'll be\nable to complete each of these tasks.\n\n167\n00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.593\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, well, if this sounds like\nsomething you'd be interested in, and\n\n168\n00:07:57.593 --> 00:07:58.134\nit should be.\n\n169\n00:07:58.134 --> 00:08:01.750\nThen Querying Data with\nTransact-SQL is for you.\n\n170\n00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.502\nSo make sure you catch every single\nepisode, and thanks for watching ITProTV.\n\n171\n00:08:05.502 -->
