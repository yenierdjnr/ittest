7.\n\n3\n00:00:07.786 --> 00:00:09.660\nNow most of you have\nalready heard of the OS.\n\n4\n00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.255\nIt's why you're here, but\nfor those who haven't,\n\n5\n00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:15.320\nRHEL is the largest commercially\nsupported version of Linux.\n\n6\n00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.250\nAnd what that means is,\nyou can go and you can pay for it,\n\n7\n00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.910\nwhich I know sounds contradictory for\nLinux,\n\n8\n00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.160\nthat normally we get it for\nfree from the various providers.\n\n9\n00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.110\nBut we can pay for it, and in exchange for\nthat payment, we get support.\n\n10\n00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.830\nWe get an actual corporate entity\nsitting behind the distribution that's\n\n11\n00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.270\navailable to assist us\nwhen we have problems.\n\n12\n00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.734\nAnd that's really something that's\nextremely important if you're using\n\n13\n00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:37.420\nLinux in a production environment.\n\n14\n00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.560\nAnd let me tell you, a lot of people are.\n\n15\n00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.793\nWhen you go out on the Internet,\n\n16\n00:00:40.793 --> 00:00:43.776\nthe majority of web servers you hit\nthese days are Linux-based web servers.\n\n17\n00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:46.890\nFortune 500 companies rely\non it every single day.\n\n18\n00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.137\nAll of the big Tech startups that are out\nthere using on a regular basis, and\n\n19\n00:00:51.137 --> 00:00:53.169\nRed Hat is at the forefront of that.\n\n20\n00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:55.228\nNow, because there's a pay element to it,\n\n21\n00:00:55.228 --> 00:00:57.588\na lot of people don't have\na lot of exposure to it.\n\n22\n00:00:57.588 --> 00:00:59.357\nBut you'd actually be surprised.\n\n23\n00:00:59.357 --> 00:01:02.481\nMany of the free Linux\ndistributions that are out there,\n\n24\n00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:04.890\nare based on the work that Red Hat does.\n\n25\n00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.010\nSo if you've run CENTOS,\n\n26\n00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.780\nwhich is the Community Enterprise\nOperating System, it is actually build\n\n27\n00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.460\nright off of the public open Source\ncode from Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n28\n00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.990\nOracle Linux, same thing.\n\n29\n00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.900\nBuilt right off of Red Hat's code base,\nand even Amazon's Linux AMI that they\n\n30\n00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.170\nuse on Amazon web services that is used\nby millions of virtual machines around\n\n31\n00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.200\nthe world also built off of\nRed Hat's open source code base.\n\n32\n00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.370\nSo the work that Red Hat\ndoes to improve and\n\n33\n00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.140\nsecure their product, gets out there and\nimproves other platforms too.\n\n34\n00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.980\nSo if you've worked with CENTOS,\nor the Linux AMI from Amazon, or\n\n35\n00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.430\nOracle Linux you've actually already\nworked with Red Hat, and your skillset\n\n36\n00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.210\nmoves right into it, and everything's nice\nand the same, and that works out great.\n\n37\n00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.240\nBut in addition if something goes\nwrong You can pick up the phone,\n\n38\n00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.860\nopen up a support ticket with Red Hat, and\n\n39\n00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.710\ntheir engineers will help\nyou through the problems.\n\n40\n00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.530\nThat's what makes it\nsuch a robust platform.\n\n41\n00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.080\nNow, in this video series, what we're\ngonna do is we're gonna take a look\n\n42\n00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.790\nnot just at what Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nis, but how we can use it.\n\n43\n00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.450\nAnd we're gonna run through some of\nthe different configuration schemes and\n\n44\n00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.800\nsettings, the way that we configure\nthe system and get it online, and\n\n45\n00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.920\nmake it where you can get out there\nin a production environment and\n\n46\n00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.240\nuse it to its fullest.\n\n47\n00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.315\nWe start by taking a look at how to\ninstall Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n48\n00:02:16.315 --> 00:02:18.770\nEither doing it manually or\ndoing it automated.\n\n49\n00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.340\nIf you need to roll out to a thousand\nmachines, you don't want to go and\n\n50\n00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.310\ndo this by hand.\n\n51\n00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.190\nWe'll show you how to create\na custom installer and\n\n52\n00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.960\nactually get that installation going.\n\n53\n00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.600\nWe'll show how to use\nthe security features inside of\n\n54\n00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.750\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\n55\n00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.940\nThere's SE Linux and Firewalld.\n\n56\n00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.350\nThere's all sorts of additional\nsecurity sublayers that are in there.\n\n57\n00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.460\nAnd we show how they work,\nhow you configure them,\n\n58\n00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.560\nand how you can maintain them to maintain\nthe most secure operating system possible.\n\n59\n00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.480\nWe also spend a good bit of time looking\nat file systems, choosing the right file\n\n60\n00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.950\nsystem really does have a big impact\non how your server performs, and so\n\n61\n00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.550\nwe get a chance to see that and how it\nworks inside of the Red Hat environment.\n\n62\n00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.287\nAnd then lastly,\nwe throw in some odds and ends.\n\n63\n00:02:54.287 --> 00:02:57.899\nSome other services and things that you\nmight need out there in the real world,\n\n64\n00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:01.507\nlike how to back up the system, how to\ndo snapshots, how to install software,\n\n65\n00:03:01.507 --> 00:03:03.641\nthird-party software, and maintain that,\n\n66\n00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:06.787\nhow to use the graphical user\ninterface as well as the command line.\n\n67\n00:03:06.787 --> 00:03:10.197\nAnd all the other skills that are needed\nfor a systems administrator that's gonna\n\n68\n00:03:10.197 --> 00:03:12.800\nbe supporting\na Red Hat Enterprise Linux environment.\n\n69\n00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.320\nSo if you're that kind of person,\n\n70\n00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.670\nif you're tasked to the job of supporting\nRed Hat, this is the place for you.\n\n71\n00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.480\nIf you just wanna learn more about it,\nif you're a hobbyist and you wanna explore\n\n72\n00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.250\nthe world of Red Hat Enterprise Linux,\nagain, another great place to jump in.\n\n73\n00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.890\nIf you're just getting started with Linux,\nthough, if you've never really touched\n\n74\n00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.150\nthe OS before, this might not be\nthe best place for you to start.\n\n75\n00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.237\nYou might wanna check out some of\nthe other shows we have on ITPRO.TV,\n\n76\n00:03:33.237 --> 00:03:36.585\nlike the Linux+ content, where we take\nyou from no Linux skill all the way up\n\n77\n00:03:36.585 --> 00:03:39.015\nto being proficient as\na basic system administrator.\n\n78\n00:03:39.015 --> 00:03:41.240\nThat's a great starting point for you.\n\n79\n00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.883\nBut if you've already worked with Linux,\nand\n\n80\n00:03:42.883 --> 00:03:45.455\nyou're more concerned with just\nlearning the differences in Red Hat and\n\n81\n00:03:45.455 --> 00:03:48.002\nhow we can support it in our environment,\nthen this is the show for you.\n\n82\n00:03:48.002 --> 00:03:50.786\nAnd if this sounds interesting,\nwell stay tuned,\n\n83\n00:03:50.786 --> 00:03:55.069\ncuz we've got episodes of Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux version 7 coming up next.\n\n84\n00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.539\n[SOUND]\n\n",
