Hey, Vonne, thank you for having me,\n\n13\n00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.650\nand I'm excited as always to be here\nworking with you on Office Pro TV.\n\n14\n00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.550\nYeah, we get to talked about one\nthose topics, it's really near and\n\n15\n00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.000\ndear to me and remember this is something\nthat I've been teaching for a long time.\n\n16\n00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.110\nAnd I've just always love good\nold relational database design.\n\n17\n00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and honestly, this is true.\n\n18\n00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.571\nI mean, we're friends off camera and\nhe really is a database dork, [LAUGH].\n\n19\n00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:06.220\nAnd so,\n\n20\n00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.360\nI knew when you talked to me about I'm\nlike, that is how she really kind of cool.\n\n21\n00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.620\nAnd you can think of databases and\ncollecting information,\n\n22\n00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.820\nbut is is so\nsuper important everything relies on\n\n23\n00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.990\nstoring data\n&gt;&gt; It really does,\n\n24\n00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.530\nyou look at our networks today and\n\n25\n00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.210\nthe way we use our computers to store\ndata everything is database driven.\n\n26\n00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.700\nJust about everything we do is\nbased on some type of web app or\n\n27\n00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.915\nsomething like that where you go to\na web page and it knows who you are,\n\n28\n00:01:36.915 --> 00:01:41.000\nit remembers things you've ordered last\ntime or what you looked at recently.\n\n29\n00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.710\nOr sales app where a sales\nperson is pulling up a record or\n\n30\n00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.454\nsome information about a customer has got\ntheir name, their phone numbers, and their\n\n31\n00:01:48.454 --> 00:01:52.200\nanniversaries, and their kid's names, so\nthey can have that conversation with them.\n\n32\n00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.110\nAll the data has to be stored somewhere,\nit has to be retrieved efficiently and\n\n33\n00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.130\nquickly when they need it.\n\n34\n00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.142\n&gt;&gt; And somebody has designed that, right?\n\n35\n00:02:01.142 --> 00:02:04.960\n[LAUGH] I mean, somebody has really sit\ndown and think about, all right, what\n\n36\n00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.250\ntype of information we're gonna store, how\nit's all going to be relate it together,\n\n37\n00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.030\nI'm jumping a little ahead on\nbecause I know about this much.\n\n38\n00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.840\nBut it's super important to\nmake sure that you get it\n\n39\n00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.771\nright-\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n40\n00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:18.470\n&gt;&gt; From beginning.\n\n41\n00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.500\n&gt;&gt; And we would be definitely\ntalking as we go through here,\n\n42\n00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.875\nwe're gonna start up with some basics,\nand some terminology that we need to be\n\n43\n00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:27.066\nfamiliar with, so we can all be on\nthe same page as we discuss this.\n\n44\n00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:29.680\nBut this is gonna be a lot of theories,\n\n45\n00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.630\nwe're gonna talk about what\nmakes a good database design.\n\n46\n00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.990\nAnd it is extremely important,\nI do get excited,\n\n47\n00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.410\nit takes a special kind of person I\nthink to get excited about databases.\n\n48\n00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.979\nBut if it is done properly in\nthe beginning it makes everything so\n\n49\n00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:47.626\nmuch easier down the road\n&gt;&gt; And I think this is something that I\n\n50\n00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:51.104\nhave kind of figure out you said\nit takes a special person, [LAUGH]\n\n51\n00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:51.631\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n52\n00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:53.925\n&gt;&gt; It is not a straight forward as I kinda\n\n53\n00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:58.880\nthought it would be, it's like,\nI just want all these information.\n\n54\n00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.230\nLet's just store it all together and\nthat's not how it's done.\n\n55\n00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.580\n&gt;&gt; Not anymore, it was originally, right?\n\n56\n00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.289\nI mean, back before we had\nrelational database design or\n\n57\n00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:12.776\nrelational database as a concept,\nwe did just that.\n\n58\n00:03:12.776 --> 00:03:17.620\nIn fact, most of you out there probably\nright now have a spreadsheet, right?\n\n59\n00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.565\nThat you're looking at or that you've\nused or used through work and it's huge.\n\n60\n00:03:21.565 --> 00:03:26.036\nYou've got dozens if not 20,\n30 columns of information, thousands and\n\n61\n00:03:26.036 --> 00:03:31.450\nthousands of rows and sometimes that's the\nway you need to store that information.\n\n62\n00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.410\nMaybe it make sense, but a lot of times if\nwe can get that out of that what we call\n\n63\n00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.490\na flat file and into a database,\nthe ability to work with that data, look\n\n64\n00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.680\nat that data from different perspectives,\nretrieve data just what we want.\n\n65\n00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.830\nAll without having to\nmanipulate the data itself.\n\n66\n00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.730\nAnd that's really the key because Excel,\nfor example, and\n\n67\n00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.290\nwe have several video episodes on Excel.\n\n68\n00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.210\nExcel is powerful, I love Excel.\n\n69\n00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.620\nAnd Some of the things that it can\ndo are very database like nowadays.\n\n70\n00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.870\nBut if we go back 30 years,\nback into the 70s,\n\n71\n00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.960\na spreadsheet was what was called a flat\nfile and that's how we stored our data.\n\n72\n00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.180\nAnd there were lots of problems\nwith the way that works.\n\n73\n00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.154\nAnd we'll talk about some of\nthem as we go through, but\n\n74\n00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:19.680\nlet's talk a little bit about where these\nrelational databases come from, just so\n\n75\n00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.570\nwe got a little bit of background.\n\n76\n00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.305\nBack in 1970 EF Codd,\nwas a gentleman mathematician,\n\n77\n00:04:26.305 --> 00:04:30.590\nthat proposed the idea of\na relational database.\n\n78\n00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.300\nNow I'm not saying he the first one\nbecause you know how it is in these types\n\n79\n00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.870\nof scenarios.\n\n80\n00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.598\nA lot of times it's named after\nthe person that made it popular or\n\n81\n00:04:38.598 --> 00:04:41.488\nbrought it to the attention not\nthe person that first thought of it.\n\n82\n00:04:41.488 --> 00:04:46.848\nBut EF Codd is known as the godfather or\nthe grandfather of relational databases,\n\n83\n00:04:46.848 --> 00:04:52.690\nbecause he's the one who said, let's apply\nmathematics to the way we store data.\n\n84\n00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.700\nAnd he came up with this\nrelational model of storing data.\n\n85\n00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.970\nAnd like I said, this was back in 1970,\nand it changed a lot of things, it brought\n\n86\n00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.490\nthat concept to the forefront because\nbefore that we were using just flat files.\n\n87\n00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.632\n&gt;&gt; And it's more of like, cuz my whole\nthing, put it all in one place and\n\n88\n00:05:11.632 --> 00:05:16.430\njust make it like you said,\n40 columns and 50,000 rows, and all that.\n\n89\n00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.517\nAnd it's all in this one place but\nthe whole idea is\n\n90\n00:05:21.517 --> 00:05:27.710\nto break it up into related pieces and\nhow they tie together.\n\n91\n00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.100\nWhat is the common thread between those?\n\n92\n00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.970\nIs that the general idea of how\nthe relational database design?\n\n93\n00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:36.820\n&gt;&gt; It is, it actually is.\n\n94\n00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.230\nIf we are gonna define\na relational database,\n\n95\n00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.860\nit's gonna be data\nthat's stored in sets or\n\n96\n00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.280\nsets of data that are organized into\ntables, that contain columns and rows.\n\n97\n00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:53.100\nAnd then have relationships between\nthose tables that tie the data together,\n\n98\n00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.210\nthat will allow me to work with.\n\n99\n00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.750\nIf we look at my screen here,\nI've got an example, this is\n\n100\n00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.960\nan old spreadsheet that I've got laying\naround that has a lot of data on it.\n\n101\n00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.080\nThe columns are a little squished because\nsome of the information I don't want to\n\n102\n00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.400\nshow on screen, but\nthis is a typical flat file.\n\n103\n00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.495\nThis is a rather large spreadsheet it\nhas a lot of rows not too many columns.\n\n104\n00:06:13.495 --> 00:06:17.525\nBut the problems you run into with\nscenarios like this or data stored like\n\n105\n00:06:17.525 --> 00:06:22.285\nthis, is when you try to insert new\ninformation, it becomes challenging\n\n106\n00:06:22.285 --> 00:06:25.825\nbecause if you don't have every bit of\ninformation you're gonna have blanks.\n\n107\n00:06:25.825 --> 00:06:28.845\nLike I can see blanks here, and\nthose are gonna cause problems.\n\n108\n00:06:28.845 --> 00:06:33.835\nIf there's data repeated like this is,\nlet's say two companies were listed here,\n\n109\n00:06:33.835 --> 00:06:36.940\nand then in another column they've\ngot their address listed there.\n\n110\n00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.710\nWell, let's say that company\nchanges their shipping address.\n\n111\n00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.400\nIf I'm gonna update this file properly,\nI've gotta find every place that that\n\n112\n00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.390\ncompany is listed and update every single\none of them with their new address.\n\n113\n00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.160\nIf I don't, if I miss one or two,\nI now have inconsistent data.\n\n114\n00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.630\nAnd sometimes I'll see one address, but\nother people might pull up a query and\n\n115\n00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.790\nsee a different address and\nnow we don't know which one is correct.\n\n116\n00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.210\n&gt;&gt; Well, and\nif you keep on going on that kind of idea\n\n117\n00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.960\nthere could be a whole other\ncolumn that has another address.\n\n118\n00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.570\nAnd that could be the address of\nthe sales person or where they live.\n\n119\n00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.610\nSo now I have, wait is the address for\n\n120\n00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.470\nthe salesperson,\nis the address for the customer?\n\n121\n00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.890\nCuz it's on the one place,\ncuz you need all that information.\n\n122\n00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:18.611\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n123\n00:07:18.611 --> 00:07:23.140\nit gets hard like you're saying\nto kind of manage all of that.\n\n124\n00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.433\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what if the organization\nhas three locations, so\n\n125\n00:07:25.433 --> 00:07:27.510\ndo I have to have three separate columns.\n\n126\n00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.340\nOne for each address that they have and\nwhat if all the other\n\n127\n00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.160\ncompanies that don't have three locations,\nall those are now gonna be blank.\n\n128\n00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.560\nSo inserting a brand new column just\nto support one record updated and\n\n129\n00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.680\nthat's not efficient.\n\n130\n00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.540\n&gt;&gt; And, maybe I would think well,\nI would just go ahead and\n\n131\n00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.715\nput it on another worksheet.\n\n132\n00:07:43.715 --> 00:07:47.320\nCuz if I'm working in excel I\ncould have multiple worksheets,\n\n133\n00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.890\nso that's related to each other,\nbut it's not.\n\n134\n00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.497\nI mean, that's where the kind of\nflat thinking in my mind of not\n\n135\n00:07:55.497 --> 00:07:59.940\nbeing a database person, I'm like but\nlook I have all these worksheet tabs.\n\n136\n00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:00.780\nBut they don't connect.\n\n137\n00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.445\n&gt;&gt; They don't.\nAnd\n\n138\n00:08:01.445 --> 00:08:06.800\nthat's where I say Excel is becoming very\npowerful and it's very database-like.\n\n139\n00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.520\nBecause with Excel today,\nwe can have multiple worksheets,\n\n140\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.480\nI can start doing some really cool things\nto start tying the data together, so\n\n141\n00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.670\nit's almost like a database but not quite.\n\n142\n00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.497\nIt still has its limitations and it takes\na lot more work whereas a database,\n\n143\n00:08:22.497 --> 00:08:25.830\na relational database,\nit's really what it's designed to do.\n\n144\n00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.500\nIt makes working with is so much easier.\n\n145\n00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.485\n&gt;&gt; And I think it's common\nas a misconception, and\n\n146\n00:08:29.485 --> 00:08:31.090\nwe say through a lot of our Excel shows.\n\n147\n00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:37.960\nThis is not a database,\nlike a technically defined database.\n\n148\n00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.580\nYeah, but have store information.\n\n149\n00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.910\nBut not in the sense of what we we're\ngoing to talk about in this show\n\n150\n00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:48.670\nof how you really have to think\nabout how it all ties together and\n\n151\n00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:49.990\nhow you have to build it.\n\n152\n00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.640\nAnd it's hard, it's hard to think of it,\nand it's because I'm so\n\n153\n00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.230\nExcel driven, learning of all\nthese concepts, I'm like, okay,\n\n154\n00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:04.010\nthat makes sense, all right, but\nit's hard to wrap your head around it.\n\n155\n00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.585\n&gt;&gt; It is, and so we're gonna see how\ndatabases can make storing data,\n\n156\n00:09:07.585 --> 00:09:10.970\nretrieving data,\nupdating data a whole lot easier.\n\n157\n00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.363\nAnd really, what we're gonna focus\nin on in this class is not a,\n\n158\n00:09:14.363 --> 00:09:18.010\nwhat's a good way to say,\nwe're not looking at any particular\n\n159\n00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:22.490\nwhat we call\na Relational Database Management System,\n\n160\n00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:27.470\nRDMS, like SQL Server, or\nAccess or anything like that.\n\n161\n00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:31.040\nWe're not getting into, we have episodes\nin our library, if you wanna learn one\n\n162\n00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.290\nof those particular relational database\nmanagement systems, that you can watch.\n\n163\n00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:39.020\nWhat I wanna talk about in this series is\ngonna be more about the database itself\n\n164\n00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.940\nand designing that database and\nmaking it efficient.\n\n165\n00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.980\nBecause what you'll find is people\nstart working with databases.\n\n166\n00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.020\nLet's say you've been tasked,\n\n167\n00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.100\nyou're boss has come to you, you're the\none that maybe has the most experience or\n\n168\n00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.470\nthe most gumption and\nthey think you can get it done.\n\n169\n00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.410\nSo they say we need you to take all\nthis stuff that we've got in these Excel\n\n170\n00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.480\nspreadsheets and make us a database so\nthat we can write queries, so\n\n171\n00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.430\nthat we can run reports, so we can pull\nthis information out when we need it.\n\n172\n00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.590\nAnd so, you're left trying to get\nthat information in their database.\n\n173\n00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:10.900\nAnd you can do it, right, because within\na database we're gonna have tables\n\n174\n00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.430\nthat are columns and rows, and they're\nvery much like a spreadsheet, right?\n\n175\n00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.440\nA spreadsheet is a sheet with columns and\nrows.\n\n176\n00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.230\nBut if it's not done properly,\n\n177\n00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:23.080\nwhen you go to try to retrieve that data,\nrun your queries,\n\n178\n00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.410\nrun your reports, you'll find either\ninconsistent or it just doesn't work.\n\n179\n00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.120\nYour results will be inconsistent or\n\n180\n00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.290\nit just doesn't work because it wasn't\ndesigned properly in the first place.\n\n181\n00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:35.674\nIf we take the trouble to\nset it up first correctly,\n\n182\n00:10:35.674 --> 00:10:38.520\neverything else will work so much better.\n\n183\n00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.972\n&gt;&gt; I always equate this to,\nthis is like the introduction chapter in\n\n184\n00:10:41.972 --> 00:10:46.053\nyour textbook you really should read,\nbut everybody skips over it [LAUGH] goes\n\n185\n00:10:46.053 --> 00:10:49.320\nright to the middle and like,\nwell, how do I do this?\n\n186\n00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.790\nAnd then, you're almost,\n\n187\n00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:55.910\nyou're making a detriment to yourself\nbecause you don't understand concepts.\n\n188\n00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:00.287\nSo, if you just read the intro chapter,\nunderstand those terms really, really,\n\n189\n00:11:00.287 --> 00:11:02.912\nactually understand the terms and\nthe concepts,\n\n190\n00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:05.866\nit's going to make the implementation so\nmuch better.\n\n191\n00:11:05.866 --> 00:11:07.842\nCuz you don't want to get down the road,\n\n192\n00:11:07.842 --> 00:11:11.798\nmaking a poorly designed database cuz\nthen everybody's gonna be calling you and\n\n193\n00:11:11.798 --> 00:11:15.830\nblaming you that you did not organize this\nproperly, and I can't work with this.\n\n194\n00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:20.520\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\nit is tempting to just fire up Access,\n\n195\n00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.590\nnew table, and just start entering\ncolumn names and start entering data.\n\n196\n00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:29.390\nAnd you might get lucky, but most likely\nit's not going turn out that well.\n\n197\n00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:33.584\nOr it is gonna be more work as you go to\nget it to work, whereas if you start out\n\n198\n00:11:33.584 --> 00:11:38.177\nwith a good plan in the first place, it\nwould be much smoother and more enjoyable,\n\n199\n00:11:38.177 --> 00:11:41.468\nand maybe you will start to\nenjoy databases as much as I do.\n\n200\n00:11:41.468 --> 00:11:44.650\n&gt;&gt; Prior planning prevents poor,\nwhat was that thing?\n\n201\n00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:46.380\nPrior, goodness.\n\n202\n00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.950\n&gt;&gt; Prior planning prevents-\n&gt;&gt; Poor performance?\n\n203\n00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.170\n&gt;&gt; P, poor, yeah, I don't wanna say it.\n\n204\n00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:52.090\n&gt;&gt; A bunch of Ps.\n\n205\n00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:55.861\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Do your homework,\nplan ahead, and you will do okay.\n\n206\n00:11:55.861 --> 00:11:57.608\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Think of a word, P, but\n\n207\n00:11:57.608 --> 00:11:59.050\npoor performance.\n\n208\n00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.197\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH] yeah, that one.\n\n209\n00:12:00.197 --> 00:12:02.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; This is a PC show so we should be nice.\n\n210\n00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.320\nSo Mike, where should we start?\n\n211\n00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.258\nI mean, we talked terminology, right?\n\n212\n00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:08.050\n&gt;&gt; Right, exactly, so\na little bit of history,\n\n213\n00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.760\nnot that that's super important to your\ndesign, knowing where it came from.\n\n214\n00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.630\nAnd then, it's been around for\na while, and we'll talk,\n\n215\n00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.082\nmaybe, we probably won't\ngo back into that.\n\n216\n00:12:18.082 --> 00:12:18.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cuz you guys\n\n217\n00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.270\ndon't really care about what\nhappened back in the '70s, right?\n\n218\n00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:25.690\nIt's just now we have these\ncool relational databases.\n\n219\n00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:27.360\nSo let's start with some terms.\n\n220\n00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.716\nBecause there are some terms,\ndepending on what book you're reading,\n\n221\n00:12:30.716 --> 00:12:34.800\nif you go out and you start studying up on\nthis, or you're talking to other people.\n\n222\n00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.078\nI want to make sure we have\nthat terminology down so\n\n223\n00:12:37.078 --> 00:12:40.460\nwhen they say something like entity,\nwe know what we're talking about.\n\n224\n00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.728\nAnd we'll define the terms, and\n\n225\n00:12:42.728 --> 00:12:47.674\nthen we'll talk about what we normally\ncall them as humans, all right?\n\n226\n00:12:47.674 --> 00:12:48.681\n[LAUGH] Real world situation.\n\n227\n00:12:48.681 --> 00:12:52.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good way to say it.\n\n228\n00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.260\nSo let's take a look at my screen here,\nand\n\n229\n00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.050\nI've just got some basic terms\nthat we need to be familiar with.\n\n230\n00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.867\nThe first one is entity, right, or object.\n\n231\n00:12:58.867 --> 00:13:02.200\nThe something of interest\nthat you want to track.\n\n232\n00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.000\nUsually a noun, or a collective noun.\n\n233\n00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.580\nSo an entity or an object,\n\n234\n00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.350\nthat's something that we\nwant to put in our database.\n\n235\n00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.880\nSo when we think about what we're\ncreating this database for, and\n\n236\n00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:18.710\nwe'll talk about a statement of purpose\nlater, I want to track customers, right?\n\n237\n00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:21.300\nCustomers is my noun, that's my object or\n\n238\n00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.590\nmy entity that I want to\nput in this database.\n\n239\n00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:25.710\nAnd there's gonna be multiples, right?\n\n240\n00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:26.760\nIt's not gonna be just one.\n\n241\n00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.180\nBut you might want to track customers and\ntheir sales and\n\n242\n00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:34.370\nthe person that sold it to them and\nthe items that they bought.\n\n243\n00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:35.650\nSo as we're going through here,\n\n244\n00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.570\nthe objects that we'll put in\nthe database are those nouns.\n\n245\n00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:42.500\nCustomer, salesperson, item, order, right?\n\n246\n00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.520\nThese are all nouns that you'll see later,\nif we look at it this way,\n\n247\n00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.300\nit makes it really easy to come\nup with what tables we want.\n\n248\n00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.060\nBut objects is the first one.\n\n249\n00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:55.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and this is the general\nconcept of relational database design.\n\n250\n00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:59.830\nAnd I just wanted to maybe ask a question\nhere in the sense that when I'm hosting\n\n251\n00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:07.100\nwith Ronnie for Access show, he was using\nobject to kinda define a table, a query.\n\n252\n00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.260\nSo within the realm of Access,\n\n253\n00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:14.908\nthey might use the word object to say\nan object within Access specifically.\n\n254\n00:14:14.908 --> 00:14:17.430\n&gt;&gt; Correct, yeah, it's like if you\nlook over in your navigation tree and\n\n255\n00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:20.970\nyou see that table,\nthat table is an object inside of Access.\n\n256\n00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:21.732\nExactly right.\n\n257\n00:14:21.732 --> 00:14:25.524\nBut then, you could also say\nthat what's in that table,\n\n258\n00:14:25.524 --> 00:14:30.264\nyou're storing data about objects\nlike music CDs or things like that,\n\n259\n00:14:30.264 --> 00:14:34.388\nwhatever it is you're trying\nto track inside that database.\n\n260\n00:14:34.388 --> 00:14:34.995\n&gt;&gt; It's a thing\n&gt;&gt; A thing.\n\n261\n00:14:34.995 --> 00:14:38.841\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's a perfectly\nfine term if that works for you.\n\n262\n00:14:38.841 --> 00:14:42.118\nSo entity is the technical term if you\nread some book or something like and\n\n263\n00:14:42.118 --> 00:14:44.820\nthey talk about entities,\nyou'll know what they mean.\n\n264\n00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.260\nThe things that I wanna\nput in my database, right?\n\n265\n00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:51.610\nUsually a noun or a collective noun,\nlike customer, but\n\n266\n00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:58.610\na collective noun might be like police or\na group or a herd of animals.\n\n267\n00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.600\nHeard is still a noun, but\nit's a collective noun,\n\n268\n00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.870\nit represents more than one object.\n\n269\n00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.400\nThose can also be entities\nwithin our database.\n\n270\n00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.920\n&gt;&gt; Would that be like departments?\n\n271\n00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.910\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n272\n00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.560\ncuz an organization\nprobably has departments.\n\n273\n00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.890\n&gt;&gt; Managers would be a collective noun,\nright?\n\n274\n00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:13.580\nIt represents more,\n\n275\n00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.610\nit's not an individual,\nit's representing a group of individuals.\n\n276\n00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.350\n&gt;&gt; And that's something that\nI'm wanting to track and\n\n277\n00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:23.055\nstore as information that's\nrelated to some other things.\n\n278\n00:15:23.055 --> 00:15:24.431\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly right, see?\n\n279\n00:15:24.431 --> 00:15:25.930\nSee, you're getting there already.\n\n280\n00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.703\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; We haven't even been doing this for\n\n281\n00:15:27.703 --> 00:15:30.468\nfive minutes and you're understanding\nthese relational databases.\n\n282\n00:15:30.468 --> 00:15:33.060\nAll right, next term up here\nis going to be Attribute.\n\n283\n00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:37.800\nSo let's say our object is an employee,\nright?\n\n284\n00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.260\nThat's our noun for now.\n\n285\n00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.910\nSo our objects is employee,\nwe wanna put that in the database.\n\n286\n00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:48.010\nAttributes are gonna describe\nan entity's characteristics.\n\n287\n00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:52.190\nAnd it's important to understand that they\nshould describe a single characteristic.\n\n288\n00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.100\nThat'll come up later\nas we go through here.\n\n289\n00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.175\nBut as an employee,\n\n290\n00:15:56.175 --> 00:16:00.430\nwhat kind of attributes do you think we\nmight store dealing with our employees?\n\n291\n00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:01.968\nName?\n\n292\n00:16:01.968 --> 00:16:02.817\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n\n293\n00:16:02.817 --> 00:16:05.433\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'd wanna know what their name was,\n\n294\n00:16:05.433 --> 00:16:09.752\nmaybe their department they worked in,\ntheir phone number,\n\n295\n00:16:09.752 --> 00:16:11.595\ntheir hire date, right?\n\n296\n00:16:11.595 --> 00:16:16.981\nThese would all be things that describe\nthat entity or that object or that thing.\n\n297\n00:16:16.981 --> 00:16:19.119\nSo trying to think of another term for\n\n298\n00:16:19.119 --> 00:16:22.160\nattribute characteristic\nI guess would be the one.\n\n299\n00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.809\n&gt;&gt; Maybe like a room number for or\n\n300\n00:16:23.809 --> 00:16:25.145\nan office number-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n301\n00:16:25.145 --> 00:16:25.850\n&gt;&gt; For an employee?\n\n302\n00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:26.436\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n303\n00:16:26.436 --> 00:16:27.219\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n304\n00:16:27.219 --> 00:16:28.993\n&gt;&gt; So just things that are gonna describe,\n\n305\n00:16:28.993 --> 00:16:31.299\nwhat is it that we need to\ntrack about this employee?\n\n306\n00:16:31.299 --> 00:16:33.020\nWe might not care about their birth date.\n\n307\n00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.630\nMaybe that doesn't go in our database.\n\n308\n00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:37.090\nSo that's an attribute we dont include.\n\n309\n00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.520\nMaybe we need to track their hair\ncolor for some reason, right?\n\n310\n00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.610\nSo that can be an attribute\nthat we can include.\n\n311\n00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:46.220\nWe're free to choose whatever attributes\nwe want to track that make sense for\n\n312\n00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.620\nour purpose of our database.\n\n313\n00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.865\nWhich is understanding when\nwe talk about an attribute,\n\n314\n00:16:51.865 --> 00:16:55.530\nit's something that;s going to\ndescribe the object, right?\n\n315\n00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:59.230\nAnd then this is a tricky one sometimes,\na relation, right?\n\n316\n00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.680\nBecause we use this term\njust in our own world\n\n317\n00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.700\nin a much different way that\nwe do within databases.\n\n318\n00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.240\nBut relation is actually a table,\nall right?\n\n319\n00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.120\nIt's a tricky one for\npeople to get as the readings and\n\n320\n00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:16.230\ndocumentation will talk about,\nthis relation stores a lot of, wait,\n\n321\n00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:21.300\nthat's not, because we think relation,\nwe think between two objects, all right?\n\n322\n00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:26.834\nThat in relational data base design\nthe table is the relation, all right?\n\n323\n00:17:26.834 --> 00:17:28.790\nTable is another name for it, but\n\n324\n00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:33.030\na two-dimensional table that\ncontains tuples and columns.\n\n325\n00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:34.600\nThere's another crazy term for you.\n\n326\n00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.940\n&gt;&gt; This is not the same as database,\nlike table relationships.\n\n327\n00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:39.790\n&gt;&gt; Correct, correct.\n\n328\n00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.640\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I started to get\nconfused a little bit there.\n\n329\n00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.890\nSo this is a relation, columns and\n\n330\n00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:49.730\nrows, and where they intersect as a cell,\nand that's a relations.\n\n331\n00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.600\nCuz at the cell is the relationship\nbetween the column and the row.\n\n332\n00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I won't even take it that far.\n\n333\n00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:54.872\nI would say-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n334\n00:17:54.872 --> 00:17:56.096\n&gt;&gt; The object itself,\n\n335\n00:17:56.096 --> 00:17:58.476\nthe table itself is called a relation.\n\n336\n00:17:58.476 --> 00:18:00.307\nIt's just another name for a table.\n\n337\n00:18:00.307 --> 00:18:04.488\nSo within my database,\nI have a employee's relation.\n\n338\n00:18:04.488 --> 00:18:07.652\nI have a orders relation.\n\n339\n00:18:07.652 --> 00:18:09.487\nSo it just didn't make\nsense to me saying it.\n\n340\n00:18:09.487 --> 00:18:12.103\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You wanna say an employees table,\n\n341\n00:18:12.103 --> 00:18:15.562\na sales table, and\norders table but technically,\n\n342\n00:18:15.562 --> 00:18:18.150\nit's called a relation, all right?\n\n343\n00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:19.740\n&gt;&gt; And\nit's good to at least point this out.\n\n344\n00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.485\nCuz like you said,\nif you're reading this book,\n\n345\n00:18:21.485 --> 00:18:22.990\nI'm already thinking of relationships.\n\n346\n00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:25.990\nAnd then when you read the definition,\nlike wait, that's different.\n\n347\n00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:27.020\n&gt;&gt; Yep, it is.\n\n348\n00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.290\nAnd if you get into some crazy,\nlike later on when we start talking about\n\n349\n00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:33.570\nnormal forms, and\nif you start reading their technical.\n\n350\n00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:34.990\nRememmber this is based on math.\n\n351\n00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.080\nEF Cod was a mathematician and\n\n352\n00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.520\nhe's applying mathemathical\nformulas to the way we store data.\n\n353\n00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.430\nSo in these formulas\nyou'll see a capital R.\n\n354\n00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.900\nWell, that capital R represents the table.\n\n355\n00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.440\nBut it stands for relation, right?\n\n356\n00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.710\nSo when you see relation\npointing to something else,\n\n357\n00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.370\nwhat that means is a table, right?\n\n358\n00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:55.950\nBut in math, it's called a relation.\n\n359\n00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:58.281\n&gt;&gt; All right, that just-\n&gt;&gt; So a relation is a set of data.\n\n360\n00:18:58.281 --> 00:19:03.807\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm over here going, okay,\nit clicked a little there, okay.\n\n361\n00:19:03.807 --> 00:19:05.619\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, and then we've got, so\n\n362\n00:19:05.619 --> 00:19:06.630\nwe used the word tuple.\n\n363\n00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.960\nWe said a relation is made\nup of tuples and Columns.\n\n364\n00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.130\nWell you can probably infer what\nI could've said there, right?\n\n365\n00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:18.260\nBecause we know in a table, as you pointed\nout, we have rows and columns, right?\n\n366\n00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.761\nWe have rows going horizontally,\n\n367\n00:19:20.761 --> 00:19:26.100\nwe have columns going vertically So\na tuple is a fancy name for a row.\n\n368\n00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.850\nIt does imply a little bit more than that,\nbut\n\n369\n00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:31.600\nat this point we can really\njust think about it as a row.\n\n370\n00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.840\nBut typically when we look at a relation,\nright?\n\n371\n00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:39.490\nA table, one row is an entry for\na particular object.\n\n372\n00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:43.890\nLike on row one,\nI'm gonna have Vonne Smith, instructor,\n\n373\n00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:48.890\nphone number, the address,\noffice, hire date, right?\n\n374\n00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:53.470\nSo if we look at that entire row, it's\nall dealing with one particular entity.\n\n375\n00:19:53.470 --> 00:20:00.380\nAnd so a tuple is really kinda saying\nit's an object within the relation.\n\n376\n00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:04.080\nNow, that object is spread across a row so\nwe can call it a row.\n\n377\n00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.230\nTechnically, it's a tuple.\n\n378\n00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.080\nDoes that makes sense?\n\n379\n00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:06.780\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n380\n00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:11.130\n&gt;&gt; So, it's an instance of an object\nwithin a relation, a row within a table.\n\n381\n00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:17.070\nSo in the employees table I have several\ntuples, one for each employee, okay?\n\n382\n00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.060\nBut we're gonna call it\na row throughout the show.\n\n383\n00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.610\nI'm not gonna call it a tuple.\n\n384\n00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.600\nThat's just the way my brain works, right?\n\n385\n00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.160\nAnd that's okay, as long as you understand\nwhen you're reading documentation, and\n\n386\n00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.770\nyou see tuple, what they're referring to.\n\n387\n00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.790\nAnd then columns,\nthis is pretty straightforward.\n\n388\n00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:33.960\nWe deal with columns and\nspreadsheets, so it's no different.\n\n389\n00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:39.050\nBut let's do define it, an attribute\nof an object within a relation,\n\n390\n00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.620\ncolumn within a table, all right?\n\n391\n00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.400\nSo when you look at a table,\nyou have a column,\n\n392\n00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.840\nthat column has a header, and\nthat header might be, first name, right?\n\n393\n00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:54.840\nWell, as I follow that column down\nacross all those tuples or those rows.\n\n394\n00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:59.770\nThere's gonna be Vonne, Mike,\nBrad, Meagan, Tanisha, right?\n\n395\n00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:04.290\nSo a column is an attribute\nwithin a relation.\n\n396\n00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:08.530\nAnd that column stores the same\nattribute for all of the tuples, right?\n\n397\n00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:09.970\nYou have a phone number column.\n\n398\n00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.500\nAll the way down that column\nthere's gonna be a phone number for\n\n399\n00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.890\neach one of those rows, right?\n\n400\n00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.400\nAnd then we have identifiers.\n\n401\n00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.700\nAnd we'll take a look and\njust as soon as we get through this,\n\n402\n00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:25.060\nI'm gonna open up a database,\nwe'll pull up a relation.\n\n403\n00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:26.050\nI was like trying to say the right word.\n\n404\n00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:27.654\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say table, but\n\n405\n00:21:27.654 --> 00:21:28.533\neither way, right?\n\n406\n00:21:28.533 --> 00:21:30.898\nWe'll pull up a table and\nwe'll point these out and\n\n407\n00:21:30.898 --> 00:21:35.380\nyou'll get the visual to go along with it,\nI think it'll kind of help it sink in.\n\n408\n00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.650\nSo an identifier,\n\n409\n00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:41.960\nan attribute that can be used to identify\nentity occurrences or rows, right?\n\n410\n00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.020\nA row is an entity occurrence.\n\n411\n00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.324\nIt can be unique, non-unique,\nor composite, yeah composite,\n\n412\n00:21:47.324 --> 00:21:48.440\nif can say that.\n\n413\n00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:48.950\n&gt;&gt; Composite.\n\n414\n00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:49.662\n&gt;&gt; Composite, there we go.\n\n415\n00:21:49.662 --> 00:21:50.721\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n416\n00:21:50.721 --> 00:21:55.891\nAll right, so when we look at those\ntuples or those rows, if I'm gonna\n\n417\n00:21:55.891 --> 00:22:02.700\nretrieve that data I wanna see Vonne's\nname, address, phone number, and office.\n\n418\n00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.560\nWell, I'm telling my application\nthat whatever it is to go into this\n\n419\n00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.900\ndatabase and retrieve that information,\nand present it to me.\n\n420\n00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.530\nHow do I tell it what row I want?\n\n421\n00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.450\nI need some way to identify that row.\n\n422\n00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.765\n&gt;&gt; I just had this thorough\nrandom thought, I was like,\n\n423\n00:22:15.765 --> 00:22:19.480\nit's kinda like when you go to dry\ncleaners, then you get that little ticket.\n\n424\n00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.610\nAnd that ticket you give it to them and\nthey say, here's this number and\n\n425\n00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:23.460\nthen they push a little button.\n\n426\n00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.170\nIt goes [SOUND] it goes\nthrough all the things.\n\n427\n00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.630\nAnd there's your number,\nhere's your piece of clothing.\n\n428\n00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:30.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,\nwe've gotta identify it somehow.\n\n429\n00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:34.444\nAnd we'll see later on that's a very\nimportant part of designing our databases,\n\n430\n00:22:34.444 --> 00:22:37.740\nfiguring out what we're gonna use,\nas that identifier.\n\n431\n00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:41.926\nIt can be unique, meaning that every\nsingle row has a unique identifier, right?\n\n432\n00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:46.790\nWhereas and then that way we\ncan uniquely identify each row,\n\n433\n00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.260\nit doesn't have to be unique.\n\n434\n00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:52.250\nLike if we look at names for example.\n\n435\n00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:56.129\nThey're very well could be more than\none person that has to say first name,\n\n436\n00:22:56.129 --> 00:22:59.600\nI might still be able to use that\nas an identifier for the row.\n\n437\n00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.870\nI need to see all the employees that\nhave the first name of Mike, right?\n\n438\n00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:06.240\nOr I'm using Mike as a way to identify\nthe rows that I want to retrieve.\n\n439\n00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.210\nIt's not unique, there's more\nthan one Mike in that database or\n\n440\n00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.060\nit could be a composite, right?\n\n441\n00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:13.970\nIt can be made up of more than one column.\n\n442\n00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:19.570\nI might say that my identifier\nis the employee ID and\n\n443\n00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:22.190\nthe last name put together, right?\n\n444\n00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:25.370\nOr a better example would be the first\nname and the last name put together.\n\n445\n00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:28.020\nFirst name is not unique,\nlast name is not unique.\n\n446\n00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.610\nWe could have spouses,\nrelatives working for us.\n\n447\n00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:32.140\nBut the combination of first name and\n\n448\n00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:36.260\nlast name might give you a way to identify\nthe row that I wanna to retrieve.\n\n449\n00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:40.320\nSo I combine columns to make\nidentifiers within those rows as well.\n\n450\n00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.935\nBut in general sense, identifiers\njust the way to identify the row or\n\n451\n00:23:43.935 --> 00:23:46.510\ntuple like you're trying to retrieve.\n\n452\n00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:53.270\nIndex, unique or non-unique identifier\nused to increase search speed.\n\n453\n00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:57.220\nAll right, so\nwe can add indexes to our tables.\n\n454\n00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.471\nAnd if we think about,\nyou guys are familiar with an index,\n\n455\n00:24:00.471 --> 00:24:03.657\nif you take a book and you wanna,\nFind a particular topic,\n\n456\n00:24:03.657 --> 00:24:08.165\ndo you start at page one, and just kind\nof flip through it and look for it?\n\n457\n00:24:08.165 --> 00:24:09.720\nOr go back to the back to the index and\n\n458\n00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.920\nlook it up and go it's on page 432 and\ngo right to it?\n\n459\n00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.710\nWell in index, think about a database\nhaving thousands, and thousands of rows,\n\n460\n00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:19.990\nand you're telling it to\ngo find this one row.\n\n461\n00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:21.970\nAll right,\nwell that can take a little bit of time,\n\n462\n00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:24.430\nit has to go through all of those rows.\n\n463\n00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:29.160\nIf we have an index on that table, it\ngonna make it much faster because in this\n\n464\n00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:34.400\nis we don't have to go into the details\nof how it stores the data in pages.\n\n465\n00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:39.770\nAnd things like that, but just understand\nthat an index is simply away that we can\n\n466\n00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:43.850\nadd an identifier to speed\nup the search process.\n\n467\n00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.200\nSo, that if I have\nan index on last name for\n\n468\n00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.580\nexample, it will make it much faster to\nfind all the records, let's say I write\n\n469\n00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:55.770\na query I say I need all of the customers\nwho's last names starts with R, okay.\n\n470\n00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.720\nWell if there's no\norganization to the data,\n\n471\n00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.960\nit's gonna have to go through 10,000 rows.\n\n472\n00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.100\nHas to go through every one of them,\n\n473\n00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.200\nto make sure it gets all of the R,\nall of the way to the last one.\n\n474\n00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.360\nCuz there could be an R to very end.\n\n475\n00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.960\nIf there's an index on that table,\nwell all the Rs can be together.\n\n476\n00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.900\nAnd I can go here's the first R,\nhere's the last R.\n\n477\n00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.500\nLet me grab everything in between it,\nand I'm done.\n\n478\n00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.053\n&gt;&gt; And this is more like an internal\n\n479\n00:25:17.053 --> 00:25:18.208\nprocess if,\n&gt;&gt; It is,\n\n480\n00:25:18.208 --> 00:25:22.800\n[CROSSTALK] It's not something that we're\ngoing to, it's something that we add\n\n481\n00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:27.330\nto an existing column typically,\nwe'll do an index on last name.\n\n482\n00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:30.443\nLike, normally, and we'll talk more about\nthis as we get into the design process,\n\n483\n00:25:30.443 --> 00:25:34.370\nbut if we have a particular\ncolumn that we used to search.\n\n484\n00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:35.810\nNo matter what it is,\n\n485\n00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:38.570\nthen I can put an index on that column\nto speed up the search process.\n\n486\n00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:41.050\n&gt;&gt; Is it kind of like in\nExcel where if I wanted,\n\n487\n00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:44.190\nI would sort it by ascending order,\nor whatever.\n\n488\n00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:47.665\nLike you're saying with the R, and that\nway it makes it easier for me if I okay,\n\n489\n00:25:47.665 --> 00:25:49.620\nI need to go all the way down to here.\n\n490\n00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.470\nSo it's like an internal sort, kind of.\n\n491\n00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.680\n&gt;&gt; It is, and\nthey can get kind of complex,\n\n492\n00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.740\nsome of them actually change the way\nthe data stored in the database,\n\n493\n00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.460\non the hard disk or\nwhere ever you're storing it.\n\n494\n00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.650\nSome of them don't,\nit depends if it's unique or non unique.\n\n495\n00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:06.680\nAnd we'll get into some of\nthat a little bit later.\n\n496\n00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:11.760\nPrimary key, a unique identifier\nused to identify rows in a table.\n\n497\n00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:15.670\nNow, we already defined identifier,\n\n498\n00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:20.330\na primary key is just\na special type of identifier.\n\n499\n00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.980\nIt's one that I guarantee is unique for\nevery single row.\n\n500\n00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.260\n&gt;&gt; And maybe that example I was\nusing with laundry ticket of like,\n\n501\n00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:31.160\nokay, somebody shouldn't have\nthe same laundry ticket number as me,\n\n502\n00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.830\nbecause those are my clothes.\n\n503\n00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.680\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; And I don't want anybody else getting\n\n504\n00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.220\nmy clothes, so\nthat's why I have a unique ticket.\n\n505\n00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.200\n&gt;&gt; Yep, you might have more than one\n\n506\n00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.260\nbatch of laundry that you've\ntaken to that cleaner, right.\n\n507\n00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.610\nAnd you're saying I wanna\npick up this batch.\n\n508\n00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:50.180\nWell, how do I identify that batch versus\nthe other two batches you've dropped off?\n\n509\n00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:54.540\nThat unique identifier, that ticket\nnumber is not reused on any others.\n\n510\n00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:55.820\nThe other tickets will have your name,\n\n511\n00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.590\nyour address because\nyou're the same customer.\n\n512\n00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:01.260\nBut that particular order\nhas a unique identifier.\n\n513\n00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.490\nAnd that's what we do within our,\nI'm sorry,\n\n514\n00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:07.910\nwithin our tables is each row\nhas to have a unique identifier.\n\n515\n00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:09.850\nOtherwise, I can't identify the row.\n\n516\n00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:11.310\nIf there's nothing unique about it,\n\n517\n00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:14.500\nthere's no way to tell it apart from\nother rows databases wouldn't work.\n\n518\n00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:18.610\nSo that is a very important type\nof identifier of primary key.\n\n519\n00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.760\nAnd then the foreign key in this kind\nof concept it's gonna make a lot more\n\n520\n00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.590\nsense when you see it in action.\n\n521\n00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:28.430\nBut a foreign key is a primary key from\none table, that appears as a column in\n\n522\n00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:36.010\nanother table, creating a relationship\nbetween two relations, or tables, right?\n\n523\n00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:39.500\nAnd this where we start getting\ninto relational database,\n\n524\n00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:43.250\nbecause if I have data in one table, and\n\n525\n00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:48.690\nI have data in another table but all of\nit about employees, how do I relate that?\n\n526\n00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:52.060\nIf I can pull Von's personal\ninformation from one table, but\n\n527\n00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.250\nI have her work information\nin another table.\n\n528\n00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:56.780\nI wanna pull all\nthe information about Vonne.\n\n529\n00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:02.620\nI have to have a way to marry those two,\nor get the related information, right?\n\n530\n00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.810\nAnd that's when you take\nthe primary key from one, and\n\n531\n00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:07.370\nput it into another table and\nit becomes a foreign key.\n\n532\n00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:10.312\n&gt;&gt; This was the concept, and\nit's a very basic concept, but\n\n533\n00:28:10.312 --> 00:28:14.035\nthis was the one was a little difficult\nfor me, because I'm like, well,\n\n534\n00:28:14.035 --> 00:28:16.760\nwait you have it like it's\nalmost like duplicating.\n\n535\n00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:20.220\n&gt;&gt; But I have it here, and I have it here,\nbut it's not exactly the same.\n\n536\n00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:24.030\nBut, I know, they relate to each other, so\n\n537\n00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:25.190\nit's yeah,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n538\n00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:26.740\n&gt;&gt; It's a little confusing at first,\n\n539\n00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:29.950\nbut, like you said, I think once you start\nworking with it a little bit more, and\n\n540\n00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:33.750\nunderstanding how you have to,\nsplit the data apart.\n\n541\n00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.330\nThen that relationship that you're saying.\n\n542\n00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:38.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It does make a little bit more sense,\n\n543\n00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:42.514\nbut it's been on many,\nmany episodes with you and Ronnie.\n\n544\n00:28:42.514 --> 00:28:43.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n545\n00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:46.220\nthis learning like,\nokay that's how you have to think of it.\n\n546\n00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:50.095\n&gt;&gt; Yep, absolutely and as you said,\nit will definitely be a little more clear\n\n547\n00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:52.985\nas when we get some visuals to\ngo with this, so But this is\n\n548\n00:28:52.985 --> 00:28:57.370\nwhere we start the relationships, right,\nthis is what creates the relationship.\n\n549\n00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:01.775\nAnd let's talk about a relationship,\nlet's define it exists between tables or\n\n550\n00:29:01.775 --> 00:29:03.230\nrelations, right?\n\n551\n00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:07.810\nRelations have relationships,\ncan be a one to one,\n\n552\n00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:11.020\none to many, many to many, usually a verb.\n\n553\n00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.540\nAnd what this means is when we look\nat the relationship, here's table A,\n\n554\n00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:18.950\nhere's table B,\nin table A there's one record for Vonne.\n\n555\n00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:21.250\nLet's say I've got Vonne's\nemployee information.\n\n556\n00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:25.660\nWell she's only listed in there once,\nshe's an employee at this organization.\n\n557\n00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:30.770\nAnd then in another table,\nI have extra information about Vonne.\n\n558\n00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:35.093\nThey'll give you one record in there, then\nit can track back it contains extra info,\n\n559\n00:29:35.093 --> 00:29:36.910\nthat's a one to one relationship.\n\n560\n00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:40.677\nOr what if that other table\nwas shows that Vonne is done?\n\n561\n00:29:40.677 --> 00:29:43.400\nWell, Vonne is done many,\nmany, many shows,\n\n562\n00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:48.095\nwhen I create the relationship between\nthe employees table, and the shows table,\n\n563\n00:29:48.095 --> 00:29:53.750\nVonne will appear once in the employees\ntable, but many times in the shows table.\n\n564\n00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:57.230\nThat would be a one to many relationship\nwe expect it to to occur once and\n\n565\n00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:58.640\nonly once in this table.\n\n566\n00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.280\nBut it can occur many\ntimes in this other table.\n\n567\n00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nin that table that's describing me,\n\n568\n00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:06.880\nit could be like what computer I'm using,\nwhat's my birthday.\n\n569\n00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:11.960\nBut in that how many shows you do,\nokay, well it connects.\n\n570\n00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:16.670\nWe could go ahead and pull that, but\nit's yeah, they connect together.\n\n571\n00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:20.170\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, it creates that relationship\nbetween those relations, and\n\n572\n00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:21.140\nthe last one's a many,\n\n573\n00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:25.870\nto many, which you can probably infer now\nthat there's gonna be multiple instances.\n\n574\n00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:30.440\nIn one table that are related to\nmultiple instances in another table.\n\n575\n00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.936\nAnd that's a many to many,\nand I'll be honest with you,\n\n576\n00:30:32.936 --> 00:30:35.400\nwe typically don't like\nmany to many relationships.\n\n577\n00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:40.315\n&gt;&gt; I remember Ronnie, saying like you\nwanna try to avoid that or do work around\n\n578\n00:30:40.315 --> 00:30:44.715\nto make sure that it's almost like an\ninterpreter, between that to have it, and\n\n579\n00:30:44.715 --> 00:30:46.975\nthen it gets into joins, I know I'm\ngetting way ahead of myself, but.\n\n580\n00:30:46.975 --> 00:30:48.205\n&gt;&gt; But no that's exactly right,\n\n581\n00:30:48.205 --> 00:30:51.795\nbecause you'll find that many to\nmany's can break a lot of things, so\n\n582\n00:30:51.795 --> 00:30:55.545\nwe typically look at those as bad and\nwe wanna try to avoid them.\n\n583\n00:30:55.545 --> 00:30:58.735\nOr when we see them,\nwe can just as you say fix them.\n\n584\n00:30:58.735 --> 00:31:02.525\n&gt;&gt; And that's the whole reason why we have\nthis show is to make sure that we design\n\n585\n00:31:02.525 --> 00:31:08.610\neverything properly, so we avoid those and\nbecome pitfalls that people run into.\n\n586\n00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:09.920\nWell, I don't know but you Mike,\n\n587\n00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.350\nbut I'm actually kind of\nexcited about all of these.\n\n588\n00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:16.620\nI'd have a lot of aha moments, and\nwe're in a glossary [LAUGH] right now, and\n\n589\n00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.250\nthen going over a term.\n\n590\n00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:21.110\nBut I know you said that we have some\nexamples that we're gonna look at, so\n\n591\n00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:24.380\nwe kinda pulled all these together,\nbut what, I think we're gonna have\n\n592\n00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.582\nto come back for a part two,\nbecause we've just had too much fun.\n\n593\n00:31:27.582 --> 00:31:29.215\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna need to come back,\n\n594\n00:31:29.215 --> 00:31:29.730\nis that okay?\n\n595\n00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:30.340\n&gt;&gt; That works for me.\n\n596\n00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.190\n&gt;&gt; All right, we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap this one up.\n\n597\n00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:36.250\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Vonne Smith.\n\n598\n00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:36.910\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n599\n00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:38.475\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n600\n00:31:38.475 --> 00:31:46.497\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

OfficeProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.166\nI'm your host, Vonne Smith, and we\nare continuing on part two of our history,\n\n4\n00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:25.977\nterms, and definitions, and now we're\ngoing to demonstrate those definitions,\n\n5\n00:00:25.977 --> 00:00:30.511\nand that's a lot of Ds, and here to help\nus with the database designer himself,\n\n6\n00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:32.978\nman I keep on going, is Michael Roderick.\n\n7\n00:00:32.978 --> 00:00:34.508\nHow you doing?\n&gt;&gt; If you want to use my middle name,\n\n8\n00:00:34.508 --> 00:00:36.313\nDarren, we can just keep\nthe Ds on going right along.\n\n9\n00:00:36.313 --> 00:00:37.146\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n10\n00:00:37.146 --> 00:00:39.066\nYes, we got Ds all around.\n\n11\n00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.902\nSo, [LAUGH] we've got that going,\nbut we're gonna go ahead and\n\n12\n00:00:41.902 --> 00:00:42.980\ndemonstrate, right?\n\n13\n00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.765\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, in that first part we did we\ntalked about a lot of terminology and\n\n14\n00:00:46.765 --> 00:00:50.294\npieces, parts that kind of make\nup our relational database, and\n\n15\n00:00:50.294 --> 00:00:54.465\nI said I'd show you some of that, so\nwe can help that information sink in, and\n\n16\n00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:58.021\nwe ran out of time, so\nthat's where we're gonna start with now.\n\n17\n00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:02.481\n&gt;&gt; We just had too much fun really,\nand just to kind of preface,\n\n18\n00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:07.904\nthis is something that I know has\nhelped me, is just repeatedly listening\n\n19\n00:01:07.904 --> 00:01:13.677\nto the terms that are used within database\ndesign to really make it sink in, and\n\n20\n00:01:13.677 --> 00:01:19.284\nso we're gonna go through and hopefully,\nsink in a little bit more for you.\n\n21\n00:01:19.284 --> 00:01:21.502\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's alright, so\n\n22\n00:01:21.502 --> 00:01:25.459\nas you get older, like me,\nrepetition is key to learning anything.\n\n23\n00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:28.360\nAll right so,\nlet's took a look at my screen here, and\n\n24\n00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.163\nwhat I've got is a sample database\nfrom Microsoft Northwind Traders.\n\n25\n00:01:32.163 --> 00:01:33.942\nIt's a fictitious company, and\n\n26\n00:01:33.942 --> 00:01:38.069\nit's a very well developed database that\nhas a lot of stuff going on in it, and\n\n27\n00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:41.770\nwe're not diving into all of that,\nand we're not learning Access.\n\n28\n00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.524\nI know you and Ronnie have some great\nshows on how to work with Access, so\n\n29\n00:01:46.524 --> 00:01:51.057\nmake sure you check those out, but\nI wanna use it as a way to display.\n\n30\n00:01:51.057 --> 00:01:52.191\nI'm gonna just pick a table here.\n\n31\n00:01:52.191 --> 00:01:53.779\nI'm gonna take the employees table.\n\n32\n00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:57.950\nSo remember,\nwe talked about a relation or a table.\n\n33\n00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.376\nWell, this is a relation.\n\n34\n00:01:59.376 --> 00:02:04.580\nThis is a relation in a database, and\nyou can see it's organized in columns,\n\n35\n00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.754\nand rows, and do you remember\nwhat the other name for a row is?\n\n36\n00:02:08.754 --> 00:02:10.739\n&gt;&gt; It's a tuple?\n\n37\n00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.308\n&gt;&gt; A tuple, very good.\n\n38\n00:02:11.308 --> 00:02:12.558\n&gt;&gt; I almost said toople and\nI'm like wait, no, I think it's a-\n\n39\n00:02:12.558 --> 00:02:15.187\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I could be pronouncing\n\n40\n00:02:15.187 --> 00:02:16.395\nthat wrong.\n\n41\n00:02:16.395 --> 00:02:17.050\nTuple, Tuple?\n\n42\n00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.927\nI think it's a tuple.\n\n43\n00:02:17.927 --> 00:02:18.927\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go with row.\n\n44\n00:02:18.927 --> 00:02:19.448\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n45\n00:02:19.448 --> 00:02:20.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna go with row.\n\n46\n00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.900\nThere we go.\n\n47\n00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.490\nSo yeah, this will be a tupple,\nor a row, or\n\n48\n00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.800\nan instance of an object that\nI'm trying to track, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.458\nSo, for example, we can see that this\nparticular row is Northwind Traders versus\n\n50\n00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:40.372\nlast name Sirgenko, Maria, and there's\na email address, sales representative.\n\n51\n00:02:40.372 --> 00:02:44.587\nNotice every one of these has to\ndo with this particular employee.\n\n52\n00:02:44.587 --> 00:02:48.132\n&gt;&gt; You had to pick the row that has\nthe [LAUGH] hardest name to pronounce.\n\n53\n00:02:48.132 --> 00:02:49.940\nIt couldn't be just like Tom Jones.\n\n54\n00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.292\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, no no.\n\n55\n00:02:52.292 --> 00:02:52.840\nI like that.\n\n56\n00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.490\nIt's challenging, right?\n\n57\n00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.733\nSo that entire row has to do\nwith one particular employee.\n\n58\n00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:03.381\nHere's another entity or object that\nwe're tracking is Steven Thorp,\n\n59\n00:03:03.381 --> 00:03:07.341\nwith his email address,\nhis job title, his business phone,\n\n60\n00:03:07.341 --> 00:03:10.560\nhis home phone,\nhis mobile phone, etc., etc.\n\n61\n00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.709\nSo we see how a row is an instance\nof an entity within our database.\n\n62\n00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.677\n&gt;&gt; And this relation is the employee's?\n\n63\n00:03:20.677 --> 00:03:23.447\n&gt;&gt; This is the employee's relation,\nor the employee's table, exactly.\n\n64\n00:03:23.447 --> 00:03:27.610\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so we're going to be storing\ninformation about the employee,\n\n65\n00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.288\nnot sales or anything that's,\nthese are the employee's.\n\n66\n00:03:31.288 --> 00:03:34.818\n&gt;&gt; That's right we have other\nrelations to store that data in,\n\n67\n00:03:34.818 --> 00:03:37.044\nor other tables to store that data in.\n\n68\n00:03:37.044 --> 00:03:39.420\nSo we got tuples, rows,\nand attribute, right?\n\n69\n00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.440\nAn attribute is a column.\n\n70\n00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.520\nSo job title is something that\ndescribes my employees, or\n\n71\n00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.183\ndescribes a single aspect of my employees,\nwhether they're a vice president,\n\n72\n00:03:51.183 --> 00:03:54.640\nor a sales manager, or\na sales coordinator.\n\n73\n00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.098\nSo in this column,\nI see the same attribute for\n\n74\n00:03:58.098 --> 00:04:01.834\neach one of my objects\nthat we're tracking here.\n\n75\n00:04:01.834 --> 00:04:03.026\nFirst name, right?\n\n76\n00:04:03.026 --> 00:04:05.498\nOn one of these rows I\ndon't see a phone number.\n\n77\n00:04:05.498 --> 00:04:09.815\nThis is the first name for\neach one of the objects in that table, so\n\n78\n00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:12.690\nthat's gonna be our column.\n\n79\n00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.134\n&gt;&gt; And not to jump ahead, but\nif you did see something,\n\n80\n00:04:17.134 --> 00:04:22.695\nlike if you saw a zip code in that column,\nthat would be a problem.\n\n81\n00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:23.694\n&gt;&gt; Probably a bad thing.\n\n82\n00:04:23.694 --> 00:04:24.928\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right,\n\n83\n00:04:24.928 --> 00:04:29.001\ncuz as we run our reports, as we run\nour queries, you're gonna get a number,\n\n84\n00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:33.139\ninstead of a name back for one of your\nemployees, or it's gonna cause a failure\n\n85\n00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.278\nbecause it's expecting text and it's\nnot allowed to put numbers in there, so\n\n86\n00:04:37.278 --> 00:04:39.570\nmany bad things could definitely happen.\n\n87\n00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.038\n&gt;&gt; And that's why you're using a product,\nI forgot the term,\n\n88\n00:04:43.038 --> 00:04:45.350\nsuch as Access to help store the data, or\n\n89\n00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.913\nhow you're going to do this, that's\nwhere you can put like validation rules.\n\n90\n00:04:49.913 --> 00:04:50.914\n&gt;&gt; We can put contraints.\n\n91\n00:04:50.914 --> 00:04:51.548\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n92\n00:04:51.548 --> 00:04:53.601\nwhere we're not allowed to\nput in certain types of data.\n\n93\n00:04:53.601 --> 00:04:56.290\nWe can set the data type for\nthat particular column, exactly.\n\n94\n00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.446\n&gt;&gt; But\nthat's using that particular product.\n\n95\n00:04:58.446 --> 00:05:02.895\nWe're talking about the concept\nof understanding this as a single\n\n96\n00:05:02.895 --> 00:05:04.345\nattribute,-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n97\n00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:05.834\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n&gt;&gt; And we wanna get to the point\n\n98\n00:05:05.834 --> 00:05:08.418\nwhere we can design this table and\nthis entire database, and\n\n99\n00:05:08.418 --> 00:05:10.698\nthen when we get into the other classes,\nand Access,\n\n100\n00:05:10.698 --> 00:05:14.163\nand things like that we can talk about how\ndo you control the use of that database.\n\n101\n00:05:14.163 --> 00:05:17.274\nBut before you can let employees\nwork with it, insert data,\n\n102\n00:05:17.274 --> 00:05:20.751\nthings like that, somebody had to\ndesign each one of this columns,\n\n103\n00:05:20.751 --> 00:05:23.984\nhad to say here we're gonna make\na table called employees, and\n\n104\n00:05:23.984 --> 00:05:26.918\nI want that table to include\nemail address and job title.\n\n105\n00:05:26.918 --> 00:05:30.162\nWhat I don't want to\ninclude is hair color.\n\n106\n00:05:30.162 --> 00:05:35.319\nSo somebody had to consciously make the\ndecision of what column, what attributes\n\n107\n00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:40.478\nare we going to track about these objects\nthat we're trying to track, and that's\n\n108\n00:05:40.478 --> 00:05:45.433\nthe design process, and then later on we\ncan control the data entry part of it.\n\n109\n00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:48.184\nThat becomes a whole other of class, which\nwe'll have some fun doing as well, or\n\n110\n00:05:48.184 --> 00:05:49.371\nyou and Ronnie have already done.\n\n111\n00:05:49.371 --> 00:05:52.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so continuing down our list,\n\n112\n00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.030\nattributes, columns.\n\n113\n00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.015\nSo the column is just these, an attribute\nfor each one of the objects there.\n\n114\n00:05:58.015 --> 00:06:01.049\nIdentifiers, hard to see right here, but\n\n115\n00:06:01.049 --> 00:06:04.756\nlike this ID column is most\nlikely is an identifier,\n\n116\n00:06:04.756 --> 00:06:10.169\ncuz it would identify each one of\nthe rows, in fact, it's the primary key.\n\n117\n00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:15.454\nIf we're gonna switch over to,\ngo over to design view for a second,\n\n118\n00:06:15.454 --> 00:06:20.740\nand you'll see right there,\nthat there's a little key next to ID,\n\n119\n00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:27.326\nand again, this is program specific, so\nit will look different in other programs,\n\n120\n00:06:27.326 --> 00:06:32.056\nbut the concept they were talking about,\none of my columns,\n\n121\n00:06:32.056 --> 00:06:36.558\none of my attributes has been\nflagged as the primary key.\n\n122\n00:06:36.558 --> 00:06:43.410\nA type of identifier that's guaranteed to\nuniquely identify each one of those rows.\n\n123\n00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.228\n&gt;&gt; Like here at ITProTV we all have\nan employee number, and it's on our little\n\n124\n00:06:47.228 --> 00:06:50.939\nbudges, and how we sign into our time\nclock, and everything like that.\n\n125\n00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:55.756\nSo that would be a unique\nidentifier that is our primary key,\n\n126\n00:06:55.756 --> 00:07:00.011\nprobably in our employee's\ntables slash relation.\n\n127\n00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:01.441\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, exactly.\n\n128\n00:07:01.441 --> 00:07:05.762\nIt could be, it would definitely be what\nwe call a candidate, because I know that\n\n129\n00:07:05.762 --> 00:07:10.086\nit's gonna be unique for each employee,\nor it should be, and if I'm looking for\n\n130\n00:07:10.086 --> 00:07:14.660\nsomebody to identify each row, that would\ndefinitely be one of the possibilities.\n\n131\n00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.099\n&gt;&gt; And\nmaybe as part of the design process,\n\n132\n00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:20.993\nof you thinking how I want to do this,\na social security number.\n\n133\n00:07:20.993 --> 00:07:24.538\nI mean, everybody is supposed to have\na unique social security number, so\n\n134\n00:07:24.538 --> 00:07:28.160\nthat could be your primary key, and\nit kind of almost does like double duty.\n\n135\n00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.763\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n136\n00:07:28.763 --> 00:07:34.362\n&gt;&gt; It's information about that person,\nbut it's also a primary identifier,\n\n137\n00:07:34.362 --> 00:07:38.680\nand maybe you don't even use\ncustomer IDs or employee IDs.\n\n138\n00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.447\nThat's one,\nhow your organization is setup, and\n\n139\n00:07:42.447 --> 00:07:47.274\nhow do you want to store the information,\nwith that primary key.\n\n140\n00:07:47.274 --> 00:07:49.585\n&gt;&gt; Conceptually,\nI'm gonna agree with everything you said.\n\n141\n00:07:49.585 --> 00:07:51.578\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; From the security side of things\n\n142\n00:07:51.578 --> 00:07:55.237\nyou're gonna say, did you say social\nsecurity number as a key in my database?\n\n143\n00:07:55.237 --> 00:07:55.995\nAah!\n\n144\n00:07:55.995 --> 00:07:57.926\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was waiting for that to come down,\n\n145\n00:07:57.926 --> 00:08:02.319\nbecause everytime I start talking about\nthis, I mean, I'm an office person, and\n\n146\n00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:06.460\nit's just like I have y'all coming,\nand I'm like security, and I'm like,\n\n147\n00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.505\ndon't scare them, but, yes [LAUGH].\n\n148\n00:08:08.505 --> 00:08:11.032\n&gt;&gt; And depending of the situation\nit very well could be that\n\n149\n00:08:11.032 --> 00:08:12.547\nit's a very controlled access.\n\n150\n00:08:12.547 --> 00:08:17.190\nAnd it's okay to use a Social Security\nnumber as a way to uniquely identify.\n\n151\n00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.969\nI'm sure it's done in several things like,\nmaybe patient data, I don't know.\n\n152\n00:08:20.969 --> 00:08:23.972\nBut if it's something that a lot\nof employees have access to,\n\n153\n00:08:23.972 --> 00:08:25.778\nI probably wouldn't wanna do that.\n\n154\n00:08:25.778 --> 00:08:30.143\nBut yeah, the point that you're trying to\nmake is it's definitely something that's\n\n155\n00:08:30.143 --> 00:08:31.169\ngoing to be unique.\n\n156\n00:08:31.169 --> 00:08:34.748\nIt's one way that I could\nuniquely identify my employees.\n\n157\n00:08:34.748 --> 00:08:39.456\nWhereas birthday might seem like a good\none at first, but there's no guarantee\n\n158\n00:08:39.456 --> 00:08:43.477\nthat we don't have two people that are,\nsay, born on the same day.\n\n159\n00:08:43.477 --> 00:08:47.107\nOr that we hire somebody eventually\nthat shares that same birthday, so\n\n160\n00:08:47.107 --> 00:08:49.957\nthat's not gonna be a good candidate for\na primary key.\n\n161\n00:08:49.957 --> 00:08:53.410\n&gt;&gt; Going back to that thought process and\nreally thinking it out.\n\n162\n00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.310\nCould somebody have the same employee ID,\nor a birthday, or\n\n163\n00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.990\nthings like that, so thinking about it.\n\n164\n00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.672\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; You got to use that,\n\n165\n00:09:01.672 --> 00:09:03.071\nwhat does Ronnie say?\n\n166\n00:09:03.071 --> 00:09:03.594\nKidneys!\n\n167\n00:09:03.594 --> 00:09:04.297\n&gt;&gt; Kidneys, yeah [LAUGH].\n\n168\n00:09:04.297 --> 00:09:08.178\n&gt;&gt; Kidneys right here [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we got identifier.\n\n169\n00:09:08.178 --> 00:09:12.706\nWe talked about a key in general,\nan index, those are really things, I mean,\n\n170\n00:09:12.706 --> 00:09:16.870\nI can probably, let's see if we have-\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot of tables.\n\n171\n00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.410\n&gt;&gt; They have a lot of stuff in here.\n\n172\n00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.170\nSomewhere in here,\nthey've got a bunch of indexes as well.\n\n173\n00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.670\nBut I don't see them off the top\nof supporting objects, but\n\n174\n00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.057\nindex is you don't really see, per se.\n\n175\n00:09:29.057 --> 00:09:33.050\nYou'd see them represented here\nin a program like this, but\n\n176\n00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:36.508\nthey're not visual,\nI guess is a good way to say it.\n\n177\n00:09:36.508 --> 00:09:39.018\n&gt;&gt; I feel, and\nthat's where the internal process,\n\n178\n00:09:39.018 --> 00:09:42.862\nI remember going through this with\nRonnie where, I think it's a check box.\n\n179\n00:09:42.862 --> 00:09:46.615\nDo you want this to be indexed, and\nit was just kind of like, okay,\n\n180\n00:09:46.615 --> 00:09:48.372\nyeah, yeah, right there.\n\n181\n00:09:48.372 --> 00:09:50.520\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can see the particular column\n\n182\n00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.233\nthat I have selected, in this case the ID,\nthe primary key is indexed.\n\n183\n00:09:54.233 --> 00:09:57.790\nRemember we said that was\na special type of identifier.\n\n184\n00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.505\nThat primary key is an index, and\nit says index yes, no duplicates.\n\n185\n00:10:01.505 --> 00:10:06.384\nThat just means that's Access' way\nof saying it's a unique index.\n\n186\n00:10:06.384 --> 00:10:10.076\n&gt;&gt; Well, I could see how if you\nwere wanting to index a last name,\n\n187\n00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:11.790\nthere's a bunch of Smiths.\n\n188\n00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:15.607\nSo that's like yes, it is,\nI want you to index, maybe sort for\n\n189\n00:10:15.607 --> 00:10:20.015\na lack of better term, but do know\nthere's going to be multiple Smiths.\n\n190\n00:10:20.015 --> 00:10:21.064\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Here it's like,\n\n191\n00:10:21.064 --> 00:10:23.531\nif there's no duplicates,\nI'll just sequentially order it.\n\n192\n00:10:23.531 --> 00:10:26.217\nAnd maybe that's an indication\nto index it faster,\n\n193\n00:10:26.217 --> 00:10:29.305\ncuz you don't have to worry\nabout looking for duplicates.\n\n194\n00:10:29.305 --> 00:10:31.977\n&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly, and\nif you take this second field, Company.\n\n195\n00:10:31.977 --> 00:10:34.658\nWell, most of my employees work for\nthe same company,\n\n196\n00:10:34.658 --> 00:10:36.770\nthere's probably gonna be more than one.\n\n197\n00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.273\nSo if we look in there,\nwe say it is indexed,\n\n198\n00:10:39.273 --> 00:10:42.267\nbut notice it says Duplicates OK\nright next to that.\n\n199\n00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:46.959\nSo this is a non-unique type of\nindex that the I've placed on this.\n\n200\n00:10:46.959 --> 00:10:51.671\nBut it gives me the ability to search\nfaster by company if we have queries or\n\n201\n00:10:51.671 --> 00:10:53.198\nreports that use that.\n\n202\n00:10:53.198 --> 00:10:57.468\nSo they've decided they wanted to put\nan index on that particular column or\n\n203\n00:10:57.468 --> 00:10:58.225\nattribute.\n\n204\n00:10:58.225 --> 00:11:01.254\n&gt;&gt; And quickly, just in case you're like,\nwhat's a query?\n\n205\n00:11:01.254 --> 00:11:04.471\nQuery is just,\nyou're asking a question of your data.\n\n206\n00:11:04.471 --> 00:11:08.722\nAnd I want to get that answer,\nand a report is just like,\n\n207\n00:11:08.722 --> 00:11:14.165\nI want a paper report of how many sales\ndid we do in the month of February?\n\n208\n00:11:14.165 --> 00:11:17.099\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all my salespeople and the number\nof sales that they've put out, right, or-\n\n209\n00:11:17.099 --> 00:11:18.425\n&gt;&gt; Which sometimes confuses me a little\n\n210\n00:11:18.425 --> 00:11:19.972\nbit, cuz I'm like, isn't that a query?\n\n211\n00:11:19.972 --> 00:11:24.446\nCuz aren't you asking for\nhow many sales I did in February?\n\n212\n00:11:24.446 --> 00:11:28.725\nBut then a report is more of how you\ndisplay it in a visual representation of\n\n213\n00:11:28.725 --> 00:11:32.811\nit, whether it's digital or printable,\nand how you want it to look.\n\n214\n00:11:32.811 --> 00:11:33.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure.\n\n215\n00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.636\nI mean, I'm sure you do go over\nthis in your Access class.\n\n216\n00:11:35.636 --> 00:11:38.974\nBut a report can be based on,\nit can be just a table, right?\n\n217\n00:11:38.974 --> 00:11:42.108\nJust print out this table,\neverything that's in it.\n\n218\n00:11:42.108 --> 00:11:46.670\nOr it could be based on a very\nspecific query that says, hey,\n\n219\n00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:50.965\nshow me all of the sales that\noccurred between January and\n\n220\n00:11:50.965 --> 00:11:54.650\nMarch of 2017, with a value over $100.\n\n221\n00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:59.522\nThat included this item that were sold\nbefore 3 PM, but only on Thursdays.\n\n222\n00:11:59.522 --> 00:12:01.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean, we could get really crazy\n\n223\n00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:02.035\nwith our query.\n\n224\n00:12:02.035 --> 00:12:04.189\nAnd then that report would be\nbased on that query exactly.\n\n225\n00:12:04.189 --> 00:12:07.409\nBut a query, and I know I use that term,\nis a question, I think,\n\n226\n00:12:07.409 --> 00:12:08.557\nis a good way to put it.\n\n227\n00:12:08.557 --> 00:12:12.325\nThat you write in something called\nStructured Query Language to\n\n228\n00:12:12.325 --> 00:12:13.588\nretrieve this data.\n\n229\n00:12:13.588 --> 00:12:16.603\nAnd if we've designed it\nproperly in the first place,\n\n230\n00:12:16.603 --> 00:12:18.709\nthose queries will work flawlessly.\n\n231\n00:12:18.709 --> 00:12:21.196\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you don't, yuck.\n\n232\n00:12:21.196 --> 00:12:24.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's kind of hard not to use\nmore terminology that we haven't gone over\n\n233\n00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.707\nwhen we're talking about this,\nbecause it's all part of it.\n\n234\n00:12:27.707 --> 00:12:29.777\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; But just wanna throw that out there for\n\n235\n00:12:29.777 --> 00:12:32.760\nyou guys in case you're like,\nI've never heard of the word query, or\n\n236\n00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.391\nI've never heard of the word report.\n\n237\n00:12:34.391 --> 00:12:40.813\nAnd it is specific things that Access\ndoes as a database management system.\n\n238\n00:12:40.813 --> 00:12:43.298\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, all right,\nso let's keep going.\n\n239\n00:12:43.298 --> 00:12:47.184\nThen we talked about identifiers,\nkeys, primary keys, relationships, and\n\n240\n00:12:47.184 --> 00:12:47.942\nforeign keys.\n\n241\n00:12:47.942 --> 00:12:50.077\nAll right, so let's take, so\n\n242\n00:12:50.077 --> 00:12:54.525\nin this employees table we can see\nthat the ID is the primary key.\n\n243\n00:12:54.525 --> 00:12:56.620\nI can see that little key icon out there.\n\n244\n00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.612\nThat's gonna uniquely identify\neach one of these employees,\n\n245\n00:12:59.612 --> 00:13:03.110\nwhether they got the same names,\ncompanies, it doesn't matter.\n\n246\n00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.800\nI've got a way to uniquely\nidentify each one of those rows.\n\n247\n00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.674\nNow I also have a table called\nEmployee Privileges, whoops.\n\n248\n00:13:10.674 --> 00:13:17.048\n[SOUND] Okay, I think, yeah.\n\n249\n00:13:17.048 --> 00:13:19.643\nI was in the middle, it thought I was\ntrying to edit something over there.\n\n250\n00:13:19.643 --> 00:13:22.999\nAll right, so\nEmployee Privileges is a table, and\n\n251\n00:13:22.999 --> 00:13:26.286\nlet's take a look at the design view for\nthis one.\n\n252\n00:13:26.286 --> 00:13:31.746\nWe can kind of see, here I can see that\nit has two keys listed over there,\n\n253\n00:13:31.746 --> 00:13:35.340\nand notice Employee ID is one of the keys.\n\n254\n00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.210\nThis is a foreign key.\n\n255\n00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.450\nWe've taken the primary\nkey from one table, and\n\n256\n00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:45.125\ninserted it into another table, and\nnow it's gonna be a foreign key.\n\n257\n00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:49.413\nNow, how and why that works,\nwe'll talk about it a little bit later.\n\n258\n00:13:49.413 --> 00:13:51.107\nCuz it's gonna take too long to,\n\n259\n00:13:51.107 --> 00:13:55.171\nat this point we don't have enough info\nto really understand what's going on.\n\n260\n00:13:55.171 --> 00:13:59.079\nBut we'll see that what ends up is that\nthe primary key from the employees' table\n\n261\n00:13:59.079 --> 00:14:00.757\nis the one side of things, right?\n\n262\n00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:03.890\nVonne Smith has a unique employee ID.\n\n263\n00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:06.070\nWell, in the Employee Privileges,\n\n264\n00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:09.390\nVonne might have several\nprivileges assigned to her.\n\n265\n00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.680\nEach one of those privileges\nI assigned to her,\n\n266\n00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.700\nI'd say this employee\nID gets this privilege.\n\n267\n00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.592\nHer employee ID again gets this privilege.\n\n268\n00:14:17.592 --> 00:14:20.711\nSo this is a one to many relationship\nbetween that primary key and\n\n269\n00:14:20.711 --> 00:14:21.675\nthat foreign key.\n\n270\n00:14:21.675 --> 00:14:24.720\n&gt;&gt; And I know you don't wanna say,\nis this is a junction table?\n\n271\n00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.976\n&gt;&gt; This is, this is actually, yes.\n\n272\n00:14:26.976 --> 00:14:28.890\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and like you said,\n\n273\n00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:33.428\nthere's another table of maybe\na list of all the privileges.\n\n274\n00:14:33.428 --> 00:14:34.500\n&gt;&gt; And we'll show that as a fact.\n\n275\n00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.772\nLet's do that right next,\ncuz we're done with our terms.\n\n276\n00:14:36.772 --> 00:14:40.750\nSo let me zoom back out so I can stop\nmoving that around so erratically.\n\n277\n00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:46.380\nAnd when we look at this table,\ngo back to the data sheet view, all right.\n\n278\n00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:50.347\nI can see Employee ID and\nPurchase Privileges, or\n\n279\n00:14:50.347 --> 00:14:54.605\nPrivilege ID, and\nthen it says Purchase Approvals.\n\n280\n00:14:54.605 --> 00:14:56.564\nYou know what, my database,\nlet me close these tables.\n\n281\n00:14:56.564 --> 00:15:00.047\nIt somehow thinks I'm in the middle\nof editing something, and\n\n282\n00:15:00.047 --> 00:15:01.305\nlet's do that again.\n\n283\n00:15:01.305 --> 00:15:02.410\nSo we'll just open those back up.\n\n284\n00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.988\nThere we go,\nthat's what it's supposed to look like.\n\n285\n00:15:03.988 --> 00:15:07.961\nSo in this employee privileges table,\nI've got a column, Employee ID and\n\n286\n00:15:07.961 --> 00:15:10.840\nPrivilege ID, but\nnotice it's showing a name.\n\n287\n00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.320\nThat is not an Employee ID, right?\n\n288\n00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.730\nIf I hit this drop-down list, here's\nall my employees that I can pick from.\n\n289\n00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:19.810\nWell, that's not the Employee ID.\n\n290\n00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:24.630\nIf we look at the Design View, we'll see\nthat it is storing the Employee ID, and\n\n291\n00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:28.000\nthe Privilege ID, and\ntheir numbers, or their data type.\n\n292\n00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.810\nSo just understand that Access\nis doing some fancy things for\n\n293\n00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:35.660\nus and\ndisplaying the name instead of the ID.\n\n294\n00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:40.198\nBecause if I'm trying to\nassign Laura some privileges,\n\n295\n00:15:40.198 --> 00:15:44.555\nI don't know Laura's ID number by heart,\nall right?\n\n296\n00:15:44.555 --> 00:15:47.680\nBut I can come in here and I can\nchoose Laura from this drop-down list.\n\n297\n00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.158\nAnd I can give her the privilege\nof purchase approvals, right, or\n\n298\n00:15:51.158 --> 00:15:52.535\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n299\n00:15:52.535 --> 00:15:57.972\nSo what you're seeing here is just\nkind of a trick of Access where\n\n300\n00:15:57.972 --> 00:16:04.533\nit's Storing the employee ID, but\nit's displaying the employee's name.\n\n301\n00:16:04.533 --> 00:16:06.015\n&gt;&gt; And this might be a little bit,\n\n302\n00:16:06.015 --> 00:16:09.960\nlike you said, a little more advanced in\nhow we're jumping a little bit of ahead.\n\n303\n00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.380\nBut I think it's a great example of\nhow you're connecting, like you said,\n\n304\n00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:18.020\nthat ID, here's the name,\ngo ahead bring it.\n\n305\n00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.867\nIt is talking about how this\nis all interconnected and\n\n306\n00:16:21.867 --> 00:16:25.210\nhow you want to be able\nto pull it all together.\n\n307\n00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:30.840\nAnd it's just like I don't have our\nemployee numbers memorized, right?\n\n308\n00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.760\nAnd I'm sure it's like, okay they're\nnot gonna look me up as employee 32 or\n\n309\n00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.060\nwhatever number I am.\n\n310\n00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.010\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n311\n00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:40.320\n&gt;&gt; It's correlating together and\nyou just see it as Vonn Smith.\n\n312\n00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.710\nAnd in the background it has that app.\n\n313\n00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.250\n&gt;&gt; And this really doesn't have anything\nto do with the database design that we're\n\n314\n00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:44.990\ngetting ready to do.\n\n315\n00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:46.190\nThis is after the fact.\n\n316\n00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:50.398\nOnce I've created my database somebody\nis starting to use this database,\n\n317\n00:16:50.398 --> 00:16:52.680\nhow do I make it easier for\nthem to use it?\n\n318\n00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.420\nAnd we can do fancy drop-down lists, and\nlook up tables, and things like that.\n\n319\n00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.852\nAnd I know we cover those in the access\nshows or the advanced access shows, so\n\n320\n00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:02.540\nmake sure you go check those\nout to see how this works.\n\n321\n00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.390\nWhat I'm trying to show you though here\nmore than anything is the fact that we\n\n322\n00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.900\nhave relations, right?\n\n323\n00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.480\nThat are storing information\nabout objects, but\n\n324\n00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.500\nwe also have relationships\nbetween those relations, right?\n\n325\n00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.890\nIf I want to pull back Vonn's privileges,\n\n326\n00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:22.570\nI need to know Vonn's employee ID so\nthat I look up what privileges she has.\n\n327\n00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:26.680\nWell Vonne's employee ID, here I would\njust see a list of numbers normally.\n\n328\n00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.460\nAccess is hiding it, it shows names.\n\n329\n00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.350\nSo how do I know what number Vonne is?\n\n330\n00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.920\nThat's stored in the Employees table.\n\n331\n00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:37.279\nSo there's a relationship between these\ntwo that allow me to find the row for\n\n332\n00:17:37.279 --> 00:17:40.810\nthe employee I want,\nget the ID of that employee.\n\n333\n00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:45.540\nGo to the other table, look up that ID,\ndefine what privileges.\n\n334\n00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.370\nBut take it even further,\nthis is privilege ID.\n\n335\n00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.100\nAccess is again hiding\nthe details from us.\n\n336\n00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.810\nThere's actually a number\nstored in this field.\n\n337\n00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:57.420\nSo if we go and look,\nthere's a privileges table.\n\n338\n00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:02.040\nSo purchase approval is\nactually privilege number two.\n\n339\n00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.880\nSo the number two is really what's\nstored right here, and the number 45 or\n\n340\n00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:10.730\nwhatever Andrew's employment ID is stored\nhere, access is making it look pretty.\n\n341\n00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:14.350\nBut there's a relationship here as\nwell between employee privilege and\n\n342\n00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.030\nprivileges, right?\n\n343\n00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:20.020\nSo, let's take a look, let's see if we can\nreally even add a little more visibility\n\n344\n00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.380\nto these relationships.\n\n345\n00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.745\nI'm gonna go to Database Tools and\npull up my Relationships window.\n\n346\n00:18:25.745 --> 00:18:27.126\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; As I say,\n\n347\n00:18:27.126 --> 00:18:29.959\nthis is a very big complex database.\n\n348\n00:18:29.959 --> 00:18:31.061\n&gt;&gt; I'm starting to get a little scare,\nMike.\n\n349\n00:18:31.061 --> 00:18:32.330\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n350\n00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:35.186\nit is a little scary when\nyou first look at this.\n\n351\n00:18:35.186 --> 00:18:38.988\nBut I'm just gonna kind of pull some of\nthese tables that we want to pay attention\n\n352\n00:18:38.988 --> 00:18:40.080\nto, right down here.\n\n353\n00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.830\nThe ones we're just talking about.\n\n354\n00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.950\nAnd we can ignore the rest\nof the stuff for now.\n\n355\n00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:49.300\nLet me bump those up out of the way,\nand I'll come down just a wee bit.\n\n356\n00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.700\nAnd we'll zoom in here, all right?\n\n357\n00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.250\nSo those three tables that we saw,\nlet me lock that.\n\n358\n00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:00.870\nHow do I lock it?\nThere we go.\n\n359\n00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:02.810\nHere's the Employee's table.\n\n360\n00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:07.200\nHere's the Employee Privileges table,\nand here's the Privileges table.\n\n361\n00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.030\nSo the same ones we just had opened up.\n\n362\n00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:10.590\nThe employee.\n\n363\n00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.280\nThese are all the different columns,\nright?\n\n364\n00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.570\nThe attributes that we're tracking,\nI can see that primary key but\n\n365\n00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:18.370\nnotice ignore this line\ngoing up off the screen.\n\n366\n00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:21.680\nThis line right here\nbetween these two tables,\n\n367\n00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.330\nthis is the graphical\nrepresentation of a relationship.\n\n368\n00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:30.080\nNow, again this is access specific, other\nprograms will do this in different ways,\n\n369\n00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.420\nbut it's a way for us to visualize\nthe concept of what we're talking about.\n\n370\n00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:37.050\nWe're saying that this relation,\nand this relation, or\n\n371\n00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.010\nthese two tables have a relationship.\n\n372\n00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:43.342\nAnd the line is actually going,\nit's hard to tell,\n\n373\n00:19:43.342 --> 00:19:48.210\nbut it's going from the ID field over\nhere to employee ID over here, right?\n\n374\n00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:53.738\nSo the primary key ID has been taken and\ninserted into the employee\n\n375\n00:19:53.738 --> 00:19:59.700\nprivilege table as Employee ID,\ndifferent name, same field.\n\n376\n00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.770\nAnd it's a foreign key in this table.\n\n377\n00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:08.310\nYou can also see that this is a 1,\nAccess uses the infinity symbol for\n\n378\n00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:14.400\nmany, so this is a 1 to many\nrelationship between these two tables.\n\n379\n00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.040\nAn employee is gonna be listed one and\n\n380\n00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.660\nonly one time in the employee's table,\nthat's the one side of the relationship.\n\n381\n00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.250\nBut an employee can have several\nprivileges assigned, and each time they\n\n382\n00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:29.480\nare assigned a privilege, a new tupple or\nrow is added to that relation or table.\n\n383\n00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:34.160\nSo this is the many sign\nVonn could have one, zero or\n\n384\n00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.890\nten different privileges, so one to many.\n\n385\n00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:42.000\nOn the other side of things,\nhow do I know what privilege was assigned?\n\n386\n00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.040\nAll I have is the privilege ID.\n\n387\n00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.780\nWell, I can go look up\nwhat that ID represents\n\n388\n00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:50.220\nby the relationship between\nthese two relations.\n\n389\n00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.940\nSo that privilege ID is the foreign key.\n\n390\n00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:58.110\nPrivilege ID is the primary\nkey in the Privileges table.\n\n391\n00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:03.540\nSo taking the primary key added it to\na different table as a foreign key.\n\n392\n00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.600\nPrivileges are only listed once, right?\n\n393\n00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:11.470\nAll the privilege I could possibly\nassign are gonna have an ID and a name.\n\n394\n00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.360\nID1, read provisions.\n\n395\n00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.963\nID2, write permissions.\n\n396\n00:21:14.963 --> 00:21:17.250\nID3, act as the backdoor.\n\n397\n00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.400\nID4, print, right?\n\n398\n00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.875\nAnd so I can assign those to each\nprivilege that I can possibly\n\n399\n00:21:23.875 --> 00:21:28.940\nassign is only listed once but\nit could be listed here many times.\n\n400\n00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.400\nSeveral employees are allowed to print.\n\n401\n00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.890\nSo each employee that's allowed\nto print will have a row\n\n402\n00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:36.910\ninside the employee privilege table.\n\n403\n00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:42.210\nAnd so there's a one to many\nrelationship here, right?\n\n404\n00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.270\nAnd again,\nif some of that went over your head or\n\n405\n00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:48.120\nyou're like that's not making sense,\nthat's okay at this point.\n\n406\n00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.220\nReally, what I'm trying to do right now\nis to show you the kind of the general\n\n407\n00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:55.402\nconcepts of we have tables and\nor relations, right?\n\n408\n00:21:55.402 --> 00:21:59.028\nWe're gonna start using the real world's\nterms up and drop the relations and\n\n409\n00:21:59.028 --> 00:22:00.160\ntupples at this point.\n\n410\n00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.701\nSo we have tables that are related to\neach other by taking the primary key\n\n411\n00:22:04.701 --> 00:22:08.820\nfrom one table and\nadding as a foreign key to another table.\n\n412\n00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.306\nAnd then we get that relation, and\nthat relationship can be one-to-one,\n\n413\n00:22:12.306 --> 00:22:14.110\none-to-many, or many-to-many.\n\n414\n00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.425\n&gt;&gt; And maybe I miss something, but\n\n415\n00:22:16.425 --> 00:22:21.870\nin the Employee Privileges table\nthe Employee ID is also a foreign key.\n\n416\n00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:22.730\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n417\n00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.010\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n&gt;&gt; That's not a primary key.\n\n418\n00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.750\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n&gt;&gt; And I got myself a little confused.\n\n419\n00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.020\nSo, wait,\nshould everything have a primary key?\n\n420\n00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.090\nBut you don't-\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n421\n00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:31.757\n&gt;&gt; This.\nIt does.\n\n422\n00:22:31.757 --> 00:22:32.287\n&gt;&gt; Actually yes.\n\n423\n00:22:32.287 --> 00:22:34.860\nAnd here's a great point.\n\n424\n00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.910\nThat key symbol right here is not\nsaying that it's a foreign key, right?\n\n425\n00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.500\nThere is no real symbol for foreign key.\n\n426\n00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.940\nThe primary key is added to\nthis table as a foreign key.\n\n427\n00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.570\nThese two little key icons?\n\n428\n00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:49.670\nThis is a composite primary key, right?\n\n429\n00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:54.949\nBoth of those fields together make up\nthe unique identifier for this table.\n\n430\n00:22:54.949 --> 00:22:58.315\n&gt;&gt; Because Vonn-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sorry I just got it [CROSSTALK]\n\n431\n00:22:58.315 --> 00:23:01.449\nThat was my internal voice coming outside.\n\n432\n00:23:01.449 --> 00:23:03.242\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n433\n00:23:03.242 --> 00:23:06.270\nbecause I might list Vonn\nin here several times.\n\n434\n00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:09.400\nShe might have several\nprivileges assigned to her.\n\n435\n00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.620\nSo her ID could be listed in here one,\nfive, 20 times.\n\n436\n00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:17.040\nSo that's not a way to\nuniquely identify the rows.\n\n437\n00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.740\nThe privilege ID, again,\n\n438\n00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:23.410\nI could assign several employees\nthe privilege to access the back door.\n\n439\n00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.530\nSo the privilege itself\ncould be listed many times.\n\n440\n00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.763\nSo that can't be a primary key, so\n\n441\n00:23:28.763 --> 00:23:33.545\nneither one of the fields in here is\na suitable or a primary key candidate.\n\n442\n00:23:33.545 --> 00:23:36.673\nBut if I combine the two,\nyes, Vonn can appear once but\n\n443\n00:23:36.673 --> 00:23:41.740\nI'm only gonna assign Vonn the permission\nto access the back door one time.\n\n444\n00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.440\nI might assign her in a different role,\n\n445\n00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.990\nthe ability to access the front door,\nright?\n\n446\n00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:48.870\nBut those two combined will be be unique.\n\n447\n00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:50.436\nDoes that make sense?\n\n448\n00:23:50.436 --> 00:23:51.037\n&gt;&gt; Totally.\n\n449\n00:23:51.037 --> 00:23:55.199\nAnd I think that's something I hadn't\nreally Ronnie didn't really present it\n\n450\n00:23:55.199 --> 00:23:59.494\nthat way cuz I think we were just,\nI was like, primary, primary, primary.\n\n451\n00:23:59.494 --> 00:24:04.338\nBut the composite part, that was always\nlike, okay, yeah, I just glossed over it.\n\n452\n00:24:04.338 --> 00:24:05.940\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And there is different ways of doing\n\n453\n00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:09.530\nit, this is something that in the design\nprocess, as we go through this process\n\n454\n00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:13.600\nthroughout these episodes, we'll see that\nI didn't have to do a composite key.\n\n455\n00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:18.160\nI could have added a third field and\njust started numbering them.\n\n456\n00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.690\nHey, this is the first entry,\nthis is the second entry.\n\n457\n00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:25.540\nAnd I could have made up my own unique\nidentifier, for each one of those rows and\n\n458\n00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.460\nused it as the primary key.\n\n459\n00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.520\nAnd there's good and\nbad to doing it that way.\n\n460\n00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.260\nOr, not adding a column and\njust making a composite primary key.\n\n461\n00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.750\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so there's more than one\nway to achieve what you need.\n\n462\n00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:43.428\nBut you said pluses and minuses on\nboth ways and how you could design.\n\n463\n00:24:43.428 --> 00:24:46.140\nWhether the composite\nversus that auto number and\n\n464\n00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:49.060\nthat's the primary key in\nthat one particular table.\n\n465\n00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:53.100\nAnd that's just something you have to,\nI guess just take some practice.\n\n466\n00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:54.141\nRight?\nAnd experience\n\n467\n00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:55.990\n&gt;&gt; It does, looking at it sometimes I\n\n468\n00:24:55.990 --> 00:25:01.630\nthink conceptually it's easier to see\nwhen you do a composite key like this.\n\n469\n00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:03.340\nWhereas, if I just made up my own number,\n\n470\n00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:07.720\nthat number doesn't really mean anything\nto the privilege being assigned.\n\n471\n00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:12.650\nSo it's kind of, I almost used the word\nrandom, but it's not meaningful.\n\n472\n00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:14.280\nSo that might bother people.\n\n473\n00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.130\nBut then when you start looking\nat the ways storage occurs,\n\n474\n00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:21.430\nif we're talking about a small database,\nno big deal.\n\n475\n00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:27.815\nBut if we're talking about hundreds of\nthousands of records, or rows and tables\n\n476\n00:25:27.815 --> 00:25:33.040\nin here, starting to store composite\nprimary keys, takes up extra space.\n\n477\n00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.416\nAnd so it could be a performance thing or\n\n478\n00:25:35.416 --> 00:25:39.640\na storage thing that leads me\ntowards one decision or the other.\n\n479\n00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.510\nAgain, that'll come down the road but\nit's something to start thinking about.\n\n480\n00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:43.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's also one of those,\n\n481\n00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.110\njust because it can do it doesn't\nmean you have to implement it, and\n\n482\n00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:52.198\nyou really have to know\n&gt;&gt; like I said the scope of your work,\n\n483\n00:25:52.198 --> 00:25:55.070\nand what do you want it to do?\n\n484\n00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.988\nDo I really need to use a composite key?\n\n485\n00:25:57.988 --> 00:26:02.657\nAt least I know what it is and understand\nthe concept, and then I can determine of\n\n486\n00:26:02.657 --> 00:26:07.118\nlike, we are just never get that big or,\nwe're never gonna go go that far for\n\n487\n00:26:07.118 --> 00:26:11.005\nour Dancing Dogs Incorporated,\nthat's what we used in Access.\n\n488\n00:26:11.005 --> 00:26:13.420\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And in this case, employee ID and\n\n489\n00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.560\nprivilege ID, those are both gonna be\nnumbers, most likely very small numbers.\n\n490\n00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:22.330\nSo me adding a third column to this\ntable and another piece of data for\n\n491\n00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:26.870\nevery single row, I'm taking up\nspace that I don't really need to.\n\n492\n00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.590\nBecause by combining those\ntwo that are already there,\n\n493\n00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:31.180\nI can make that composite primary key.\n\n494\n00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.500\nSo that might be the way,\nthat we choose to go.\n\n495\n00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:39.170\n&gt;&gt; Because that prior proper planning,\nprevents poor performance.\n\n496\n00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:40.230\n&gt;&gt; That's right. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n497\n00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:45.510\nlast thing I wanna show you here,\nis the relationships themselves.\n\n498\n00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:47.500\nRight, I'd say this is one to many.\n\n499\n00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.040\nAgain, every RDMS or\n\n500\n00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.380\nRelation Database Management System\nmight show this information differently.\n\n501\n00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:56.450\nAccess users, the infinity symbol for\nthe many side.\n\n502\n00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:00.670\nBut if I double click on this, we're gonna\nactually see the relationship, right?\n\n503\n00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:04.860\nThe relationship exists\nbetween the employee's table,\n\n504\n00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.890\nthe field ID And\nin the employee privileges table,\n\n505\n00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:12.540\nthe employee ID field,\nor column, I should say.\n\n506\n00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.920\nAccess calls them fields,\nyou'll hear me say that a lot as well,\n\n507\n00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.890\nbecause it's just a habit cuz Access\nis one of my tools that I use a lot.\n\n508\n00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:22.890\nField, column, attribute.\n\n509\n00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:25.960\nAttributes are stored in fields or\nattributes are stored in columns, so\n\n510\n00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.055\nI should have put that\non my definition list.\n\n511\n00:27:28.055 --> 00:27:33.430\nColumns slash Field, we're not worried\nabout the preferential integrity,\n\n512\n00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:38.180\nbut look at the very bottom,\nit says one to many relationship right?\n\n513\n00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:42.310\nSo, that means somehow let\nme lock my zoom on here.\n\n514\n00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:46.070\nI can't get out of my zoom, here we go.\n\n515\n00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:51.690\nMaybe I'm zooming forever, great.\n\n516\n00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.360\nThere we go,\nwhat was I goinna try and show you?\n\n517\n00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:58.958\nSo when we look in here, and\nif I want to draw, Vonne, what was that?\n\n518\n00:27:58.958 --> 00:28:00.280\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Use the mouse, the mouse-click.\n\n519\n00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:04.880\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so here's the one to\nmany, this is a one to many relationship.\n\n520\n00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:09.710\nAnd notice the one is on this side,\nright, and the many is on this side.\n\n521\n00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:13.650\nAgain, this is kind of program-specific,\nso not too worried about that but\n\n522\n00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.040\nI want to show you that concept, right?\n\n523\n00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.859\nWe have one-to-many relationships.\n\n524\n00:28:19.996 --> 00:28:21.385\nAnd I just broke my computer.\n\n525\n00:28:21.385 --> 00:28:22.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n526\n00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:27.630\nI think I just trashed Access, so there we\ngo, let's get Access back, there it is.\n\n527\n00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:32.260\nLet me cancel that and let me just find\nyou another example up in here real quick.\n\n528\n00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:36.070\n&gt;&gt; It's like this is what happens when you\ninstal one of our fancy programs that we\n\n529\n00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:42.248\nused to use a long time ago and forgot all\nthe keyboard shortcuts and everything.\n\n530\n00:28:42.248 --> 00:28:45.480\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was trying to find maybe a one to one\n\n531\n00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:49.220\nrelationship, but I don't see.\n\n532\n00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.450\nAnd there should be one here,\norder detail status.\n\n533\n00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:56.950\nI'm just gonna find one.\n\n534\n00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:59.380\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of one\none to manys aren't there?\n\n535\n00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.090\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n536\n00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:03.431\nIt was just typically that's\nthe most definitely the most common,\n\n537\n00:29:03.431 --> 00:29:06.887\nI can't find one off the top of my head,\nor off the real quick here, but\n\n538\n00:29:06.887 --> 00:29:09.650\nyou would see down here\nit would say one to one.\n\n539\n00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:13.840\nYou might have a situation where\nI've got employee's table.\n\n540\n00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:17.590\nEach one of those employees has\na single row representing them and\n\n541\n00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:22.320\nall their attributes, and\nthen another table I've got notes.\n\n542\n00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.460\nBut each employee would have one row for\nnotes.\n\n543\n00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.400\nAnd if I have more notes I just\ngo back to that one row and\n\n544\n00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.640\nadd more notes about Vaughn.\n\n545\n00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.560\nSo, it'd be all one to one type thing.\n\n546\n00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:36.550\nA lot of times order and order details,\nand that's what I was looking for.\n\n547\n00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:42.590\nCuz a lot of times orders and\norder details actually have a one to one,\n\n548\n00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:46.300\nbecause for each order there's\nonly one detail for that order.\n\n549\n00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.550\nOther ways of organizing it\nthough you might see details for\n\n550\n00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:49.940\nthe individual items on the order.\n\n551\n00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:54.460\nSo, anyway,\nI don't wanna get too far into Access.\n\n552\n00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.520\nI don't wanna get hung up on\nthe way Access does things.\n\n553\n00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.840\nI wanna really focus on\nthe concepts of how we got here.\n\n554\n00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.010\nHow did we design that mess of tables\nthat we were just playing with?\n\n555\n00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:05.940\n&gt;&gt; And in the design process\nthat we're gonna get into,\n\n556\n00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.640\nI mean,\nall of these concepts are gonna come back.\n\n557\n00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.030\nSo we'll have other\nexamples of one to one.\n\n558\n00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:13.630\nIt's funny cuz I'm trying to remember\nthe one we did in the Access show.\n\n559\n00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:15.540\nI'm like, I can't remember either.\n\n560\n00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:17.620\nBut I'm sure we'll get\nto it along the way.\n\n561\n00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.630\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah,\nyou see it used a lot of times.\n\n562\n00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:23.390\nIf I've got a field that not\neverybody is gonna have.\n\n563\n00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:26.320\nLike I might have an employees table and\n\n564\n00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:32.530\nI wanna track their personal webpage,\nif they have a personal webpage.\n\n565\n00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:35.810\nThe majority of my employees\ndon't have a personal webpage, so\n\n566\n00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:40.250\nif I put that column in that table,\nmost of them are gonna be blank except for\n\n567\n00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:42.160\nVonne who has a personal webpage.\n\n568\n00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.560\nIf I took hat and put it into a separate\ntable and related it back to the original\n\n569\n00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.940\ntable, now anybody that has a webpage\nwould have a row in that second table.\n\n570\n00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.750\nBut if you didn't have a webpage,\nyou just wouldn't have a row.\n\n571\n00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:56.430\nIt wouldn't be a blank in my first table,\nso.\n\n572\n00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:59.185\n&gt;&gt; Isn't there something about what\nyou wanna try to avoid blanks?\n\n573\n00:30:59.185 --> 00:31:04.950\n&gt;&gt; Null values are bad because we don't\nknow if it's data that's missing or\n\n574\n00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:06.660\nyou don't know what it is.\n\n575\n00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:11.820\nNull data is not zero, right,\nit's unknown, so unknowns are bad, yep.\n\n576\n00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:16.500\n&gt;&gt; So that's a, kind of a good example\nof the thinking process and the concept.\n\n577\n00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:21.450\nIs every single person going to\nhave this piece of information?\n\n578\n00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:24.800\nWell if the answer's no,\nthen maybe we store it somewhere else and\n\n579\n00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:25.470\nrelate it together.\n\n580\n00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:28.630\n&gt;&gt; And it's a design process, there\nare times where you're gonna have blanks,\n\n581\n00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:29.862\nthey're not unavoidable.\n\n582\n00:31:29.862 --> 00:31:34.090\nOr they're completely unavoidable, and\nit might make sense in certain scenarios.\n\n583\n00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:37.250\nI'm not saying that you can\nnever have blanks or no values.\n\n584\n00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.680\nBut definitely something we're gonna\nthink about in that design process.\n\n585\n00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.250\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\nWell,\n\n586\n00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:44.000\nI think this is a great\nstart to our series.\n\n587\n00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.640\nGetting ourselves\nfamiliar with everything,\n\n588\n00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.920\nwe got a solid foundation\nof our terminology.\n\n589\n00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.670\nThen we'll start using different\nterminology like fields,\n\n590\n00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.400\nyeah, we already pulled\nanother one in there, but\n\n591\n00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:57.440\nat least along the way we're gonna\nkeep on talking about this stuff, and\n\n592\n00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.240\nreally get into making some fun\nlittle databases, aren't we?\n\n593\n00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:01.740\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n594\n00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:02.911\n&gt;&gt; I think they're gonna be fun,\n\n595\n00:32:02.911 --> 00:32:04.735\nhopefully you guys think\nthey're fun as well.\n\n596\n00:32:04.735 --> 00:32:07.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] How could this not be fun?\n\n597\n00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.712\nCome on now.\n\n598\n00:32:07.712 --> 00:32:10.770\n[LAUGH] So all right, we're gonna\ngo ahead and wrap this one up, too.\n\n599\n00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:14.500\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host Vonne Smith.\n\n600\n00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.490\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n601\n00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:17.107\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you soon.\n\n602\n00:32:17.107 --> 00:32:20.191\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Hey, thanks, Vonne.\n\n9\n00:00:30.535 --> 00:00:31.830\nAnd thanks for\nhaving me back here on OfficeProTV.\n\n10\n00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.502\nExcited as always and yeah,\n\n11\n00:00:33.502 --> 00:00:37.870\nit's about time we get to actually\ndesigning a database, right?\n\n12\n00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.900\nNo, I mean,\nwe've laid our foundations, right?\n\n13\n00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.770\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; We've talked about some terminology\n\n14\n00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.600\nthat we need to understand.\n\n15\n00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.170\nWe've talked a lot about data\nnormalization which is a very important\n\n16\n00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.540\npart of making sure the database is\ngonna function after we create it.\n\n17\n00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.600\nWhich is always nice.\n\n18\n00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.290\n&gt;&gt; I have to say,\nI really did enjoy those episodes.\n\n19\n00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.667\nI mean it's Dorky as it sounds.\n\n20\n00:00:57.667 --> 00:00:59.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was really cool to watch you go\n\n21\n00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.010\nthrough each one of those steps of like\nokay, so her's how you might see what it\n\n22\n00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.120\nlooks like and like why you have to do\nthis and like how to get it down to that.\n\n23\n00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.720\nThat whole like lowest\ncommon denominator of the-\n\n24\n00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.530\n&gt;&gt; Atomic values.\n\n25\n00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I always say anatomical.\n\n26\n00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.305\nAnd then it's like, nope, that's not\nwhat we're talking about over here.\n\n27\n00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:18.380\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I need to let you just take it.\n\n28\n00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.920\nThe lowest common denominator yes.\n\n29\n00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.310\nAnd so now we're going to, it's really\ngood to understand those because without\n\n30\n00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.820\nthat kind of foundation core concepts,\ncoming in to designing a database,\n\n31\n00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.740\nyou're probably gonna end up designing\nmore like a flat file anyways.\n\n32\n00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely and we'll see as we\ngo through this process where we'll still\n\n33\n00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.750\ngo through those normalization phases\ntowards the end of our design process.\n\n34\n00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.280\nBut because we're already\nfamiliar with them and\n\n35\n00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.130\nbecause we're thinking of them in the back\nof our mind as we're creating our\n\n36\n00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.510\ndatabase, a lot of it will be\ndone by the time we get there.\n\n37\n00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.650\nAnd so it's just less work.\n\n38\n00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.920\nWhereas if you design it without any\nidea of what normalization means,\n\n39\n00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.950\nyou get to the end and now I've got alot\nof work to do to get this to a workable,\n\n40\n00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.576\nusable database because I didn't\nthink about it ahead of time.\n\n41\n00:02:02.576 --> 00:02:07.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and I mean I always kind of\npreach this concept in anything that\n\n42\n00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.630\nI do with like my Adobe products, if\nyou're going to be starting in design or\n\n43\n00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.940\nphotoshop or you need to have\nan idea of where your going.\n\n44\n00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.810\nYou need to have, okay this is what I\nwant to get to, this is my end result.\n\n45\n00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.428\nThen you have to kinda go backwards from\nthere and start the designing process\n\n46\n00:02:23.428 --> 00:02:27.405\nin your head and where I need to be and\nkinda thinking all of that, so\n\n47\n00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:31.832\nthat you don't get too far down\nthe line and realize like I'm stuck.\n\n48\n00:02:31.832 --> 00:02:34.160\n[LAUGH] Now I gotta back up and\nredo everything.\n\n49\n00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.290\nSo it's good to do anything.\n\n50\n00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.090\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and\n\n51\n00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.090\nwe're gonna take a look at this process of\ndesigning a database from the beginning.\n\n52\n00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.910\nWhat it's like to say okay,\nI need a database and then go from there.\n\n53\n00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.350\nAnd it's important that we\nhave some kind of plan.\n\n54\n00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.500\nAs you say, know where we're going.\n\n55\n00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.720\nUnderstand what it is we're trying\nto accomplish in order to successful\n\n56\n00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.840\ndesign that relational database.\n\n57\n00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.040\nWhat you don't want to do I think.\n\n58\n00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.410\nAnd I see this a lot and\nit's very tempting.\n\n59\n00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.290\nIt's very easy to fall in this trap\nof my boss has come to me and said,\n\n60\n00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.820\nhey, we need a database to\nsupport this application.\n\n61\n00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.120\nAnd you go to your computer and\n\n62\n00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.630\nyou fire up access and\nyou just start creating tables.\n\n63\n00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.260\nAnd while that might get the job done,\nit's not the most efficient way to do it.\n\n64\n00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.130\nYou can save yourself a lot of headache\nif you do a little planning before you\n\n65\n00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.660\nget into actually creating or\nimplementing your database design.\n\n66\n00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.390\nSo that's what we're gonna focus\non today is that design process,\n\n67\n00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.480\nhow we go through that.\n\n68\n00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.150\nWell, we won't even\nbuild a database today,\n\n69\n00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.610\nit's gonna be really\nabout the design itself.\n\n70\n00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.800\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so, well,\nwhere do we start when we do anything?\n\n71\n00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.950\nIt's kind of we got, okay Y.\n\n72\n00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.560\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n73\n00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.540\nit's kind of like my opening sentence or\nI think about for writing a paper.\n\n74\n00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.660\nWell, what's my, what's that thing, gosh,\nI don't even remember what it's called.\n\n75\n00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.530\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure where\nyou're going with that one.\n\n76\n00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nThey're\n\n77\n00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.540\nlike where you do like a small like-\n&gt;&gt; Your thesis?\n\n78\n00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that's what it is.\n\n79\n00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.860\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; We'll go with thesis.\n\n80\n00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.095\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n81\n00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:06.180\n&gt;&gt; I know that first paragraph has to\n\n82\n00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.050\nhave that statement in there that kinda\ndefines where everything's going, right?\n\n83\n00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.210\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; You follow the what is it,\n\n84\n00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.640\nthe keyhole something?\n\n85\n00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.157\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna look that up while\nyou find how we're gonna do\n\n86\n00:04:12.157 --> 00:04:14.664\nit in database land [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; That's a Ronnie question.\n\n87\n00:04:14.664 --> 00:04:17.540\nRonnie's my grammar police, usually.\n\n88\n00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.010\nAll right, so yeah, we're gonna talk about\nthis process, so let's talk about it.\n\n89\n00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.120\nWe're gonna talk about\na few different phases,\n\n90\n00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.000\nwe'll start off with something\nknown as statement of purpose or\n\n91\n00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.790\nstatement of problem,\ndepending on which way you want to say it.\n\n92\n00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.140\nWe'll take a look at how we discover our\ntables, assign attributes, generate or\n\n93\n00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.760\npick keys and indexes and primary keys.\n\n94\n00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.950\nAnd then, creating the relationship or\ndetermining what\n\n95\n00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.720\nrelationships we're going to have\nbetween our relations or our tables.\n\n96\n00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.165\nSo, that first phase is, what I like to\ncall the statement of purpose right and\n\n97\n00:04:48.165 --> 00:04:50.590\nit that really describes what it is.\n\n98\n00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.500\nThe statement of purpose\nis the why part of this.\n\n99\n00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.630\nWhy am I creating this database and\n\n100\n00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.330\nthis is a very very crucial step\nin designing a good database.\n\n101\n00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.370\nBecause we need to understand,\nas the designer or\n\n102\n00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.650\ndeveloper, we've got to understand\nwhat our customer wants in the end,\n\n103\n00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.400\nso that we can make sure that\nwe set it up to support that.\n\n104\n00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.880\nBecause different people are gonna\nhave different requirements.\n\n105\n00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.490\nWe're not designing it for us.\n\n106\n00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.190\nWe're not the ones that use it.\n\n107\n00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.930\nIt's the sales department,\nthey might be my customer.\n\n108\n00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.300\nOr it's the upper level management.\n\n109\n00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.210\nOr I'm doing this as a freelance and\nI'm working for\n\n110\n00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.300\nsomebody else and\ndesigning a database for them.\n\n111\n00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.730\nI'm not designing it for me.\n\n112\n00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.740\nI have to make sure that I\ndiscuss this part with them and\n\n113\n00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.170\nfully understand what it is they want.\n\n114\n00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.900\nAnd this is a conversation you have to\nhave and sometimes you have to have it\n\n115\n00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.240\nmore than once and really refine it to\nmake sure everybody is on the same page.\n\n116\n00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.030\n&gt;&gt; We actually experienced this just\nthe other day, where one of our coworkers\n\n117\n00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.630\nsaid, hey, I have this Excel\nspreadsheet and I want this end result.\n\n118\n00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.270\nAnd we're like, wait, so do you want A?\n\n119\n00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.698\nDo you want B?\nDo you want C, which one do we,\n\n120\n00:05:58.698 --> 00:06:00.330\nwhat are you going with?\n\n121\n00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.590\nAnd we actually had to get him on\nthe phone and talk it out and like so\n\n122\n00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.570\nyou want the top-ten classes viewed or\nsomething?\n\n123\n00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.170\nOkay, now understand.\n\n124\n00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.040\nSo now I can go ahead and\ntake the steps necessary\n\n125\n00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.840\nthat I need to get you to that end result\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n126\n00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.090\nthat's a great example because in this\ncase, he was telling us what he wanted but\n\n127\n00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.040\nwe didn't understand what he wanted.\n\n128\n00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.340\nMaybe we're not using the same language,\n\n129\n00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.100\nhe thinks he's being very clear but again,\nit's a communication that has to occur.\n\n130\n00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.490\nSo that statement of purpose,\n\n131\n00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.050\nsometimes you'll see this refered to\nas the statement of problem as well.\n\n132\n00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.530\nBecause a lot of times our data\nbase is solving a problem.\n\n133\n00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.495\nI need a way to track this.\n\n134\n00:06:38.495 --> 00:06:42.600\nCurrently, we're having trouble doing\nthat or we're doing it very manually.\n\n135\n00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.340\nSo there's a problem\nwe're trying to solve.\n\n136\n00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.770\nSo either one would work, statement\nof purpose or statement of problem.\n\n137\n00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:48.780\n&gt;&gt; I feel the context or\n\n138\n00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.960\nthe connotation of a statement\nof problem sounds so ominous.\n\n139\n00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.850\nStatement of purpose sounds\nmuch more positive [LAUGH].\n\n140\n00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would tend to agree and\nthat's why you see me,\n\n141\n00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.880\nI write in my notes statement of purpose.\n\n142\n00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.170\nRight, what is the purpose\nof building this database.\n\n143\n00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.720\nProblem does, as you say.\n\n144\n00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.760\nIt starts you off on a negative note,\nI think.\n\n145\n00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and I did look at it was when we\nwere talking about writing the papers is\n\n146\n00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.920\nyour thesis statement, so\nyou get two points for being correct Mike.\n\n147\n00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.230\n&gt;&gt; Woohoo!\nI don't know, that was like 30 years ago,\n\n148\n00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.260\nhigh school or something.\n\n149\n00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.560\n&gt;&gt; I started going down I was like,\nI don't remember that thing, what I did or\n\n150\n00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.440\nI picked this as a topic to talk about.\n\n151\n00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.592\n&gt;&gt; Right, all right, so.\n\n152\n00:07:23.592 --> 00:07:26.935\nAgain, statement of purpose, it's\nan important phase, we want to make sure.\n\n153\n00:07:26.935 --> 00:07:31.522\nThe problem with this is if we goof\nup here, we might not notice it and\n\n154\n00:07:31.522 --> 00:07:36.673\nthose problems that we introduce or\nthose mistakes that we make in this phase\n\n155\n00:07:36.673 --> 00:07:42.410\ncan end up propagating all the way down to\nthe finished database and cause problems.\n\n156\n00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.702\nAnd then we really have to start\nthat design process over or\n\n157\n00:07:45.702 --> 00:07:49.460\ndo a lot of extra work to get it\nfunctioning the way we want it.\n\n158\n00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.583\nSo it's crucial that you spend\na little bit of time here and\n\n159\n00:07:52.583 --> 00:07:56.875\nreally make sure you understand, again,\nwhat it is that that customer wants.\n\n160\n00:07:56.875 --> 00:07:58.855\nAnd let's take a look at my screen here,\n\n161\n00:07:58.855 --> 00:08:01.070\nthis is an example of\na statement of purpose,\n\n162\n00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.945\nthis is the one we'll use as we Work\nthrough our designing a database process.\n\n163\n00:08:04.945 --> 00:08:06.263\nLet's read this for a second.\n\n164\n00:08:06.263 --> 00:08:10.817\nManagement of a dog obedience school\nwould like to keep track of the scheduled\n\n165\n00:08:10.817 --> 00:08:15.162\nclasses, the trainers assigned to\nthe classes, the dogs registered for\n\n166\n00:08:15.162 --> 00:08:18.170\nthe classes, and the owners of the dogs.\n\n167\n00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.055\nSo you can see by writing this down,\nwe're starting to get an idea.\n\n168\n00:08:22.055 --> 00:08:26.451\nOkay, so they need to keep track of\nthe classes that they're offering,\n\n169\n00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:31.517\nwho's teaching those classes, what dogs\nare enrolled, and who owns those dogs.\n\n170\n00:08:31.517 --> 00:08:34.074\nIt's really telling us, and\nI'll show you in a minute,\n\n171\n00:08:34.074 --> 00:08:36.966\nit's telling us what tables we're\ngonna have in our database.\n\n172\n00:08:36.966 --> 00:08:39.782\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm almost pulling out, okay, so\n\n173\n00:08:39.782 --> 00:08:42.920\nwe're probably gonna\nneed a list of trainers.\n\n174\n00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.960\nAnd we're gonna need to\nhave a list of our courses.\n\n175\n00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.525\nAnd I'm using the word list,\nbut we're really saying table.\n\n176\n00:08:49.525 --> 00:08:51.690\nAnd so\nthey're probably gonna have first and\n\n177\n00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:56.310\na last name and an addresses and\na city, state, zip for the owners.\n\n178\n00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.240\nAnd then maybe the dogs will\nhave their favorite treat,\n\n179\n00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.488\nthose types of differences.\n\n180\n00:09:00.488 --> 00:09:05.580\nI'm already kinda thinking of information\nI would want to have in those tables.\n\n181\n00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:10.280\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and if you think back to our\nterminology, and we talked about entities.\n\n182\n00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.230\nAnd we said entities are nouns or\ncollective nouns, what we do with this\n\n183\n00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:18.950\nstatement of purpose is we start looking\nfor those nouns or those collective nouns.\n\n184\n00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.610\nAnd we just list them out,\nso let's do that.\n\n185\n00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.560\nIf we look at this,\nmanagement of a dog obedience school\n\n186\n00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.242\nwould like to keep track\nof the scheduled classes.\n\n187\n00:09:27.242 --> 00:09:30.800\nTo me, there's one right there,\nthere's a good one.\n\n188\n00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.800\nSo let's underline this, whoops,\nwell, let's do that again.\n\n189\n00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.838\n&gt;&gt; You can do Ctrl+U, Mike.\n\n190\n00:09:35.838 --> 00:09:38.960\n&gt;&gt; Oo, Ctrl+U, I like my little fly-out.\n\n191\n00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.920\nI know you got a fancy name for that\nlittle thing that pops out over there.\n\n192\n00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.052\n&gt;&gt; The-\n&gt;&gt; The Quick Access little-\n\n193\n00:09:44.052 --> 00:09:46.061\n&gt;&gt; The something toolbar, yeah.\n\n194\n00:09:46.061 --> 00:09:50.150\n[LAUGH] Man,\nI am just batting zero right now.\n\n195\n00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.068\n&gt;&gt; You're playing stump the chump and\nI'm winning.\n\n196\n00:09:53.068 --> 00:09:54.720\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Totally.\n\n197\n00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.160\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nthe scheduled classes, right?\n\n198\n00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:03.490\nThe trainers, that'd be another one of my\nnouns in here, assigned to the classes.\n\n199\n00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:06.380\nSo we'll go ahead and underline that one.\n\n200\n00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:11.370\nThe dogs registered for the classes, so\nthe dogs would be another noun in there.\n\n201\n00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.750\nClasses, we've already got that.\n\n202\n00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.640\nBut we'll go ahead and highlight it again.\n\n203\n00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:19.640\nAnd the owners of the dogs,\nso we'll grab that.\n\n204\n00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.754\nAnd we'll grab that one.\n\n205\n00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:24.680\nSo you can see all I've done is\ntaking the statement of purpose and\n\n206\n00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.650\nstarted underlining the nouns really,\nor the collective nouns in it.\n\n207\n00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.877\n&gt;&gt; And that is called the mini toolbar.\n\n208\n00:10:30.877 --> 00:10:33.093\n&gt;&gt; The mini toolbar, that's the one.\n\n209\n00:10:33.093 --> 00:10:33.598\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n210\n00:10:33.598 --> 00:10:34.098\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n211\n00:10:34.098 --> 00:10:35.154\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Google.\n\n212\n00:10:35.154 --> 00:10:35.918\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n213\n00:10:35.918 --> 00:10:38.602\n&gt;&gt; All right, and so from this, and again,\n\n214\n00:10:38.602 --> 00:10:43.669\nwe would've spent a lot of time with\nthe management of this obedience school,\n\n215\n00:10:43.669 --> 00:10:47.890\nand really try to figure out\nwhat it is they're trying to do.\n\n216\n00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.290\nBecause they might have initially said,\n\n217\n00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:52.770\nhey, look, we need a database to keep\ntrack of the classes we teach, or\n\n218\n00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.760\nour classes that we run.\n\n219\n00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.680\nWell, that's not a lot of information.\n\n220\n00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.970\nSo then I sit down with them, I say,\n\n221\n00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:01.590\nwhat is it about these\nclasses that you wanna track?\n\n222\n00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:02.780\nThe name of them?\n\n223\n00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.152\nWhen they're run?\n\n224\n00:11:05.152 --> 00:11:06.020\nYeah, yeah, that makes sense.\n\n225\n00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.285\nAnd who taught them, or\nwhat the instructor was, yeah, yeah,\n\n226\n00:11:09.285 --> 00:11:12.328\nwe need that too, and\nstarting working this out with them.\n\n227\n00:11:12.328 --> 00:11:16.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz they might be like, well,\nwe wanna have people that took the dance\n\n228\n00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:20.120\nclass, we want them to take\nthe the swimming class.\n\n229\n00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.720\nAnd so we wanna be able to track\nthat cuz we can market to them.\n\n230\n00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.670\nAnd then we would want to\nhave their email addresses.\n\n231\n00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:27.910\nWe could send them things.\n\n232\n00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:33.170\nOkay, cool, you kinda have to sometimes\npull that information out of people.\n\n233\n00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.100\nThey don't even think to give it up,\n\n234\n00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.180\nif you wanna say, because it's all like,\nyeah, no, we wanna track everything.\n\n235\n00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, track what?\n\n236\n00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.285\n&gt;&gt; So you really gotta work them and\ntry to figure out is they want.\n\n237\n00:11:45.285 --> 00:11:48.180\nLet's take a look at\nanother quick example here.\n\n238\n00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.010\nI've got one.\n\n239\n00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.470\nManagement wants to create an application\nthat will track employees,\n\n240\n00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.480\ntheir role in the organization,\nand their salaries.\n\n241\n00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.550\nThey also wanna track laptops that\nhave been assigned to those employees.\n\n242\n00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.920\nSo again, we simply go through and\n\n243\n00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.920\nlook for my nouns that are most likely\ngonna include in this database.\n\n244\n00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.318\nThey wanna track employees.\n\n245\n00:12:06.318 --> 00:12:09.770\nAnd you notice that a lot of these say\nsomething about track or will track or\n\n246\n00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.690\nwant to track or wants to keep track of?\n\n247\n00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:16.550\nThat's typically the question you\nwanna ask when you're designing this.\n\n248\n00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:19.570\nWhen you're starting this statement of\npurpose, what is it that you wanna track?\n\n249\n00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:23.000\nCuz that's usually the purpose\nof a database, track something.\n\n250\n00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.210\nSo employees would be one.\n\n251\n00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.840\nAll right, their role in the organization.\n\n252\n00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.960\nWhat role would be one, right?\n\n253\n00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.700\nTheir position, their job title, maybe,\ndepending on how we wanna say it.\n\n254\n00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.710\nIn the organization, and\nI know organization'd be a noun, but\n\n255\n00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:40.330\nin this case,\nprobably not one that I'm gonna use,\n\n256\n00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.510\nbecause it all falls\nunderneath the organization.\n\n257\n00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:44.680\nAnd their salaries.\n\n258\n00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.760\nThere's one, right, that I wanna take out,\nbecause they wanna track that.\n\n259\n00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:54.520\nThey also wanna track laptops that\nhave been assigned to employees.\n\n260\n00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:59.230\nSo we simply go through here and\nthen start finding our nouns, all right?\n\n261\n00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.070\nOne more quick example here.\n\n262\n00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.610\nBob wants to track,\nI set this up for a reason, Bob.\n\n263\n00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:05.805\nLet's see if I can remember why.\n\n264\n00:13:05.805 --> 00:13:06.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Bob\n\n265\n00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:08.380\nwants to keep track of\nhis music collection.\n\n266\n00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.010\nHe wants to track the albums he owns,\nthe recording artists, and\n\n267\n00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.760\nbe able to rate the tracks.\n\n268\n00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.270\nOkay, I'm not sure why I did this one.\n\n269\n00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.510\nBut we'll do it anyway.\n\n270\n00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:22.525\n&gt;&gt; I love when you go back to\nyour own work and be like.\n\n271\n00:13:22.525 --> 00:13:23.830\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What did I do?\n\n272\n00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:24.875\nWhy did I do this?\n\n273\n00:13:24.875 --> 00:13:27.670\n[LAUGH] How do we get such things?\n\n274\n00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.410\nNo, sorry.\n\n275\n00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:34.750\nHe wants to track albums,\nthere's a noun, right, that he owns.\n\n276\n00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.600\nThe recording artist, so\nwhoever recorded that album,\n\n277\n00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.960\noops, that there, and\nbe able to rate the tracks.\n\n278\n00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.743\nWell, in this one,\ntracks we definitely want to\n\n279\n00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:51.654\nput in there but\nrate is not really a noun, right?\n\n280\n00:13:51.654 --> 00:13:56.473\nBut he wants to be able to rate them, and\nI'm sure we're gonna wanna put that in\n\n281\n00:13:56.473 --> 00:14:00.802\nthe database, so maybe we rephrase\nthis a little bit and be and track,\n\n282\n00:14:04.314 --> 00:14:10.167\nRatings assigned to tracks, right?\n\n283\n00:14:10.167 --> 00:14:10.910\n&gt;&gt; Track the tracks?\n\n284\n00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a little redundant there\n\n285\n00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.435\nbut hey, we're doing this on the fly so\nyeah, no.\n\n286\n00:14:16.435 --> 00:14:22.070\nBut ratings now would be a noun and\ntracks, again, would be a noun.\n\n287\n00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:27.910\nSo maybe this is record\nratings assigned to tracks.\n\n288\n00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:29.210\n&gt;&gt;

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was not what I wanted to do.\n\n340\n00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.895\nWe wanna make sure they\nare in that database.\n\n341\n00:16:38.895 --> 00:16:43.189\n&gt;&gt; Well, knowing that these tables are\ngonna have to be related to each other,\n\n342\n00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:47.684\nand all those connections, even just\nfrom the normalization we went through,\n\n343\n00:16:47.684 --> 00:16:49.496\nif you missed the whole laptop,\n\n344\n00:16:49.496 --> 00:16:54.290\nthere's other pieces that are contingent\non it that you might not have planned for.\n\n345\n00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.890\nSo yeah,\nyou've gotta cover all your bases.\n\n346\n00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.672\nAnd you don't wanna do the scope creep,\nright?\n\n347\n00:16:59.672 --> 00:17:01.023\nIs that what you call it\nin project management?\n\n348\n00:17:01.023 --> 00:17:02.963\n&gt;&gt; Yes, mm-hm, absolutely,\nabsolutely right?\n\n349\n00:17:02.963 --> 00:17:04.607\nWhen yeah, you start off with that,\n\n350\n00:17:04.607 --> 00:17:07.600\nit's another good reason to\nhave this statement of purpose.\n\n351\n00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.820\nThat's a great point, Vonne.\n\n352\n00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.315\nAs we get to the end, and they say,\n\n353\n00:17:11.315 --> 00:17:16.651\nwhat about the company vehicles that\nwe've assigned to certain individuals?\n\n354\n00:17:16.651 --> 00:17:19.980\nWait a second, that was not in our\noriginal statement of purpose,\n\n355\n00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.536\neverybody signed off on\nthe statement of purpose,\n\n356\n00:17:22.536 --> 00:17:25.340\nthat was not planned on being\nincluded in the database.\n\n357\n00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.759\n&gt;&gt; But-\n&gt;&gt; You can't come back now and\n\n358\n00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:28.660\nsay, we've got to have that.\n\n359\n00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:33.102\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I know that somethings,\nback with Ronnie,\n\n360\n00:17:33.102 --> 00:17:38.527\nif you do design it properly,\nthe scaling out does make it easier.\n\n361\n00:17:38.527 --> 00:17:42.300\nSo he goes, well,\nmy employees is like it's on table, and\n\n362\n00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:47.180\nI didn't really put anything else in\nthat table but the employee information.\n\n363\n00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.237\nSo then you just go ahead and\nmake like a vehicle table.\n\n364\n00:17:50.237 --> 00:17:56.672\nAnd then you connect those together so,\nhopefully, the scaling won't be as\n\n365\n00:17:56.672 --> 00:18:02.660\npainful if you design it with\nthese smallest, the anatomic.\n\n366\n00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.092\n&gt;&gt; Atomic, atomic, yes.\n\n367\n00:18:04.092 --> 00:18:05.208\n&gt;&gt; The smallest common denominator.\n\n368\n00:18:05.208 --> 00:18:07.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Those little, tiny pieces, right?\n\n369\n00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:10.380\nSmallest meaningful value,\nthat's an easy way to say it.\n\n370\n00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.107\nBut yeah, you're absolutely right.\n\n371\n00:18:12.107 --> 00:18:16.944\nAnd that's one of the big advantages\nof the relational database over a flat\n\n372\n00:18:16.944 --> 00:18:19.784\nfile style database was\nthe ability to add,\n\n373\n00:18:19.784 --> 00:18:24.195\nright, and to restructure without\nhaving to do a whole lot of work.\n\n374\n00:18:24.195 --> 00:18:26.193\nSo you're right, now,\nwe don't wanna tell them that.\n\n375\n00:18:26.193 --> 00:18:28.429\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, if they come back to us and say,\n\n376\n00:18:28.429 --> 00:18:30.663\nlook, we need to track\nthe employee vehicles as well?\n\n377\n00:18:30.663 --> 00:18:34.805\nGosh, that's gonna be at least four\nmore billing hours, something like that.\n\n378\n00:18:34.805 --> 00:18:38.200\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna say, I'm going through\na house renovation right now, and,\n\n379\n00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:38.943\nwho, I feel it.\n\n380\n00:18:38.943 --> 00:18:41.146\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n381\n00:18:41.146 --> 00:18:46.296\nBut you are right, in the end if our\ndatabase is designed properly, adding\n\n382\n00:18:46.296 --> 00:18:52.010\nlaptops or adding vehicles to it shouldn't\nbe that much of a trouble, right?\n\n383\n00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.961\nBut it could be a lot of work cuz\nwe might have to associate and\n\n384\n00:18:54.961 --> 00:18:56.686\ndesign forms associated with it.\n\n385\n00:18:56.686 --> 00:18:59.639\nAnd a lot of other stuff, but\nstill, as far as the database goes,\n\n386\n00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:01.765\ndesigned properly, shouldn't be that bad.\n\n387\n00:19:01.765 --> 00:19:03.508\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Keyword, shouldn't be.\n\n388\n00:19:03.508 --> 00:19:04.611\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n389\n00:19:04.611 --> 00:19:08.070\nyou won't get me to commit to it'll\nbe easy, because, no, no, no.\n\n390\n00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.963\nSoon as I say that,\nyou're gonna be writing me, going, Mike,\n\n391\n00:19:10.963 --> 00:19:12.102\nthis was not easy at all.\n\n392\n00:19:12.102 --> 00:19:13.452\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They changed one thing, and\n\n393\n00:19:13.452 --> 00:19:14.310\nit took me a month.\n\n394\n00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.590\nSo you never know, you never know.\n\n395\n00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.230\nAll right, so\nlet's go back to my screen here, so\n\n396\n00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:21.150\nwe'll go back up to our\noriginal statement of purpose.\n\n397\n00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:22.620\nAnd so what do I do with this?\n\n398\n00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.080\nNow that I've got a statement of\npurpose and I have gone through and\n\n399\n00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.870\nkinda picked out the names, what I would\ndo next is just list these out, right?\n\n400\n00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.870\nSo let's just drop down here and\n\n401\n00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.980\nwe'll put in an un-ordered list And\nwe can start typing them out, right.\n\n402\n00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:41.912\nScheduled Classes.\n\n403\n00:19:41.912 --> 00:19:46.577\nI got trainers, we've got Classes,\nwe've got Dogs,\n\n404\n00:19:46.577 --> 00:19:50.648\nwe've got classes again,\nwe've got Owners and\n\n405\n00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:55.340\nwe've got dogs again so\nwe don't need that one.\n\n406\n00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.930\nAll right, and so there's our list.\n\n407\n00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.420\nThis is our potential table list.\n\n408\n00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.230\nWe've just decided what\ntables are gonna be.\n\n409\n00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:08.180\nBecause remember entities, nouns, these\nare the things that we want to track.\n\n410\n00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.650\nSomething of interest to the customer\nthey want to track In a database, and\n\n411\n00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:13.640\nan entity is stored in a relation.\n\n412\n00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:19.000\nWe have a table that is going to be setup\nto store the information about dogs,\n\n413\n00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.690\nabout classes, about trainers,\nabout scheduled classes and about owners.\n\n414\n00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:24.490\nAnd I want to come back to that.\n\n415\n00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:26.570\nI did this one intentionally,\ncuz scheduled classes and\n\n416\n00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:30.240\nclasses is going to be\na little Interesting.\n\n417\n00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.710\nWe'll talk about why both of those\nare in there in just a minute.\n\n418\n00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.740\nCuz you might think well,\nwhat's the difference?\n\n419\n00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:36.906\nAren't those the same?\n\n420\n00:20:36.906 --> 00:20:37.750\nAnd they're not.\n\n421\n00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:41.904\n&gt;&gt; Well it's funny when you first wrote\nthat first one I was like well wait.\n\n422\n00:20:41.904 --> 00:20:44.800\nBecause you probably wanna have\nthese classes by themselves.\n\n423\n00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.725\nAnd then like the schedule of the classes,\n\n424\n00:20:46.725 --> 00:20:49.303\ncuz then those should actually\nbe two different things.\n\n425\n00:20:49.303 --> 00:20:53.280\nAnd then I was like, well,\nI'll just let him keep going, okay.\n\n426\n00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.360\n&gt;&gt; And you're absolutely right,\nthat's what's gonna happen, right?\n\n427\n00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.630\nWe have a class as an entity.\n\n428\n00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:03.130\nDog dancing is a class and\nit should have a name,\n\n429\n00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:07.270\nmaybe a description, maybe a cost,\nand things like that.\n\n430\n00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:11.080\nBut we schedule that class in January,\nand again in February, and\n\n431\n00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.930\nagain in March, right?\n\n432\n00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.590\nSo we need to know that\ninformation as well,\n\n433\n00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:18.730\nseparate from just the class information.\n\n434\n00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:23.360\n&gt;&gt; And then we could probably have dogs\nthat are in the classes, like the roles.\n\n435\n00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.980\n&gt;&gt; Hold onto that thought, because that's\ngonna be an important thought process\n\n436\n00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.970\nwhen we get to that phase, all right?\n\n437\n00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.520\nAll right, so that's all we do.\n\n438\n00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.660\nNow what we do with this, so\nwe've got our list of potential tables.\n\n439\n00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:38.280\nAnd I say potential tables because we're\npretty sure these are gonna go in there.\n\n440\n00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.160\nBut it might not be all inclusive.\n\n441\n00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:45.220\nThere could be other tables that we're\ngonna need to support these tables.\n\n442\n00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.060\nIt could be things that we end\nup realizing we might need to\n\n443\n00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.550\nbreak down a little bit further.\n\n444\n00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.911\nSo it's definitely not a finished thing.\n\n445\n00:21:52.911 --> 00:21:55.741\nThese are the tables we're going\nto have and that's it, but\n\n446\n00:21:55.741 --> 00:21:58.420\nthis is a great starting point, right?\n\n447\n00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:03.260\nSo we've discovered our entities are\nthings that our customers want to track\n\n448\n00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.870\nand we've listed them out.\n\n449\n00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.243\nNow the next phase we go into is trying\nto figure out again, what table.\n\n450\n00:22:08.243 --> 00:22:12.809\nSo we’ve listed them out here, and\nalso my favorite way is to either get out\n\n451\n00:22:12.809 --> 00:22:16.180\na piece of paper and\na pencil and start doing this.\n\n452\n00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.979\nA little bit difficult on the show to show\nyou that so I’m gonna do it in Excel and\n\n453\n00:22:20.979 --> 00:22:23.693\nthis is a perfectly good\nway to do it as well.\n\n454\n00:22:23.693 --> 00:22:27.251\nBut you’ll see that all I\ndid was take this list and\n\n455\n00:22:27.251 --> 00:22:31.829\ngrab a spreadsheet, or\nwhatever your preferred method is, and\n\n456\n00:22:31.829 --> 00:22:36.260\nactually each one of them as a header for\na column, all right?\n\n457\n00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.217\nDogs, Classes, Scheduled Classes,\nTrainers, Owners.\n\n458\n00:22:39.217 --> 00:22:42.821\nThese, again, are most likely going\nto become tables in my database.\n\n459\n00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:47.605\nReally they are going to\nbecome tables in my database.\n\n460\n00:22:47.605 --> 00:22:52.885\nNow that we've got the tables that\nwe wanna create our next step is to\n\n461\n00:22:52.885 --> 00:22:58.095\nstart creating the attributes or deciding\nwhat attributes we're going to check.\n\n462\n00:22:58.095 --> 00:23:01.920\nWhat is it about dogs that\nI need to keep track of.\n\n463\n00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.963\nWhat is it about trainers that\nthey want to keep track of?\n\n464\n00:23:04.963 --> 00:23:07.901\nI really should say they\nwould want to keep track of.\n\n465\n00:23:07.901 --> 00:23:11.140\nWhat is it about owners that\nthey want to track, right?\n\n466\n00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:11.773\nThat's an attribute.\n\n467\n00:23:11.773 --> 00:23:17.324\nRemember an attribute is a value that\ndescribes a single characteristic\n\n468\n00:23:17.324 --> 00:23:22.430\nof the entity or the object that\nwe are storing in that relation.\n\n469\n00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:26.469\n&gt;&gt; And those will become our columns or\nfields within our tables, right?\n\n470\n00:23:26.469 --> 00:23:28.067\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n471\n00:23:28.067 --> 00:23:29.074\nSee, look at that.\n\n472\n00:23:29.074 --> 00:23:32.800\n[LAUGH] All right, so let us go through\nand let us pretend we're doing this.\n\n473\n00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.550\nWe have a few minutes left here, I think.\n\n474\n00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.229\nAnd let's go ahead and create a list.\n\n475\n00:23:36.229 --> 00:23:39.630\nAnd, again, this is another part\nthat's gonna take some work.\n\n476\n00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:42.810\nThat's gonna maybe take more than\none time of going through it,\n\n477\n00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:47.270\nmaking this list, and\ncommunicating with the stakeholders and\n\n478\n00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:50.610\nmaking sure that, hey, is there\nanything else that I wanna record?\n\n479\n00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:53.642\nThis is where we start\ngetting existing documents.\n\n480\n00:23:53.642 --> 00:23:57.318\nI might look, they probably have,\nas a obedience school,\n\n481\n00:23:57.318 --> 00:23:59.829\nthey probably have a form that they use.\n\n482\n00:23:59.829 --> 00:24:01.671\nWhen I bring in my dog for\nthe first time and\n\n483\n00:24:01.671 --> 00:24:05.105\nI want to start enrolling in classes\nThere's a form I gotta fill out, right?\n\n484\n00:24:05.105 --> 00:24:07.032\nAnd I've gotta put all\nthis information in there.\n\n485\n00:24:07.032 --> 00:24:10.860\nThat's information that they must need or\nthat they are tracking.\n\n486\n00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.581\nI wanna look at invoices.\n\n487\n00:24:12.581 --> 00:24:17.320\nAnything that the customer is writing\ndown or tracking in any way most\n\n488\n00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.910\nlikely needs to go in our database\nif it has related to do with this.\n\n489\n00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.800\nSo this is the time to gather up.\n\n490\n00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.790\nHey, do you have any of this\nalready in a spreadsheet, right?\n\n491\n00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:31.990\nOr do you have anybody that's\nbeen writing this stuff down?\n\n492\n00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:34.390\nHow did you deal with\nthis before you had the,\n\n493\n00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:37.520\nhow are you dealing with it now\nbecause you don't have a database yet?\n\n494\n00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.480\nHow are you dealing with it?\n\n495\n00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.030\nAnd gather up all of that information.\n\n496\n00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.400\nTalk to the people and find this out.\n\n497\n00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.680\nThis is how you're gonna\ndiscover those attributes.\n\n498\n00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.850\nAnd again, we want to make sure we're\ndoing what it is that the customer wants.\n\n499\n00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:55.035\nThere's attributes about a dog,\nhow many legs does it have?\n\n500\n00:24:55.035 --> 00:24:55.862\nWell, some have four.\n\n501\n00:24:55.862 --> 00:24:58.703\n&gt;&gt; Sorry [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I might not need to put that in\n\n502\n00:24:58.703 --> 00:25:01.770\nmy data base cuz it\ndoesn't matter to them.\n\n503\n00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.770\nIf you're a three legged\ndog you can still dance.\n\n504\n00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:12.305\nWe're not going to have any kind of, what\ndo you call it, what is it when you're,\n\n505\n00:25:12.305 --> 00:25:15.710\n[LAUGH] no racism towards dogs,\nthat's not the word I'm looking for.\n\n506\n00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.410\n&gt;&gt; Discrepancies?\n\n507\n00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:21.090\n&gt;&gt; Discrepancies, there, yeah.\n\n508\n00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:24.160\nBut dogs have a color.\n\n509\n00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.146\n&gt;&gt; We are all inclusive.\n\n510\n00:25:25.146 --> 00:25:26.073\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n511\n00:25:26.073 --> 00:25:30.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They have a length of fur.\n\n512\n00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.950\nBut just because I think that might be\nsomething you wanna track about the dog is\n\n513\n00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:34.470\nnot necessarily what the customer wants.\n\n514\n00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:36.280\nI know we're kinda using silly examples.\n\n515\n00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.890\nHopefully, that'll help it stick\nwith you as we go through here.\n\n516\n00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:43.780\n&gt;&gt; Well, I also really like your\nanalog to digital kinda conversion.\n\n517\n00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.540\nYeah, you have a physical piece of paper.\n\n518\n00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.570\nYou're going old school\nby writing it down, and\n\n519\n00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:51.710\nmaybe if you collect it all in your\nlittle trapper keeper and everything.\n\n520\n00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:55.660\nAnd now you need to go ahead and\nmake this into a digital form or\n\n521\n00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.030\ndigital format that I can go ahead and\nquickly find this information.\n\n522\n00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:01.800\nCuz then you gotta go dig\nthrough all those folders and\n\n523\n00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.920\nmy trapper keeper had\na unicorn with sparkles on it.\n\n524\n00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.030\n&gt;&gt; I remember trapper keepers.\n\n525\n00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:08.198\nI don't know if they\nstill have those things.\n\n526\n00:26:08.198 --> 00:26:09.877\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, but yeah, and\n\n527\n00:26:09.877 --> 00:26:11.726\nthis is something that\nmaybe I work on with them.\n\n528\n00:26:11.726 --> 00:26:14.030\nI take it back, I fill it out,\nI get it ready.\n\n529\n00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:15.920\nMaybe I send it back and\nlet them peruse it and\n\n530\n00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.806\nsee if there's anything that I'm missing.\n\n531\n00:26:17.806 --> 00:26:21.930\nBut it's definitely now is the time\nto find out about any attribute\n\n532\n00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:24.136\nthat they need to track\nthat we might be missing.\n\n533\n00:26:24.136 --> 00:26:27.880\n&gt;&gt; Well, I think now is the time\n\n534\n00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:31.470\nthat we have a great start that\nwe need to finish this episode.\n\n535\n00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:33.137\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Because I'm looking at that clock\n\n536\n00:26:33.137 --> 00:26:35.857\nover there that's right in front of\nmy face, and so it's saying hey,\n\n537\n00:26:35.857 --> 00:26:37.530\nyou know what we might\nwant to wrap this up.\n\n538\n00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:39.030\nBut I know you have a lot\nmore to talk about.\n\n539\n00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.670\n&gt;&gt; We do.\n&gt;&gt; We need to go ahead and\n\n540\n00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:45.620\nget our attributes for\nthe tables that we want to track.\n\n541\n00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:46.690\nSo is that what we're gonna do next?\n\n542\n00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:47.500\n&gt;&gt; That is next.\n\n543\n00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.660\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, that sounds good.\n\n544\n00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:49.320\nWell, then, you know what?\n\n545\n00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.510\nWe're gonna go ahead and wrap this one up.\n\n546\n00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:54.930\nSigning off for OfficeProTV,\nI've been your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n547\n00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:55.730\n&gt;&gt;

Yeah, fun stuff, right, as we work\nour way through this design process.\n\n12\n00:00:40.362 --> 00:00:43.788\nSo yeah,\nwe had taken our statement of purpose.\n\n13\n00:00:43.788 --> 00:00:48.099\nAnd we went through it after finalizing\nit or working with our customers,\n\n14\n00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:50.810\nour stakeholder, whoever that may be.\n\n15\n00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.639\nOn making sure we had a good clear concise\nstatement of purpose that included\n\n16\n00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:58.590\neverything it was that\nthey were trying to do.\n\n17\n00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.900\nWhat is the solution that\nthey are looking for?\n\n18\n00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.953\nAnd again that's key because we wanna\nmake sure that we don't start off on\n\n19\n00:01:05.953 --> 00:01:06.654\nthe wrong foot.\n\n20\n00:01:06.654 --> 00:01:09.685\nBecause those problems are just\ngonna trickle down through the rest\n\n21\n00:01:09.685 --> 00:01:10.435\nof the process.\n\n22\n00:01:10.435 --> 00:01:14.340\nAnd in the end we'll end up with a mess\nthat is gonna be more work to try to fix.\n\n23\n00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.910\nSo important to spend some time there and\nhere as well, right?\n\n24\n00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.340\nSo at the end of that last episode we had\nour statement of purpose figured out.\n\n25\n00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.962\nWe had gone through that statement\nof purpose and found our nouns and\n\n26\n00:01:23.962 --> 00:01:24.744\ncollective nouns.\n\n27\n00:01:24.744 --> 00:01:27.967\nCuz those were our entities\nthat were gonna belong or\n\n28\n00:01:27.967 --> 00:01:30.245\nbe tracked in our database, right?\n\n29\n00:01:30.245 --> 00:01:33.409\nAn entity is an object\nthat we want to track,\n\n30\n00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.580\nof something of interest to the customer,\nall right?\n\n31\n00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.867\nSo we had that list, and\nthen we simply took a spreadsheet and\n\n32\n00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:43.647\nwe put each one of those\nnouns at the top of a column.\n\n33\n00:01:43.647 --> 00:01:45.890\nAnd let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n34\n00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.970\nAnd we can see where just\nfrom our statement of purpose\n\n35\n00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.880\nwe underlined our nouns.\n\n36\n00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.999\nWe listed those out.\n\n37\n00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:56.910\nAnd then we've just taken those and\nput those right across the top here.\n\n38\n00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.394\nI like using little mini tables within\nExcel, but again, it doesn't matter.\n\n39\n00:02:00.394 --> 00:02:05.610\nTypically you could do this on paper,\nanything you wanted is going to work.\n\n40\n00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.895\nBut at this point,\nwe've got our tables, right?\n\n41\n00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:11.870\nNow we have to think about our attributes.\n\n42\n00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.890\nAttributes are those things\nthat describe our entity,\n\n43\n00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.360\na single characteristic about our entity.\n\n44\n00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.260\nSo these are gonna become the columns\nin our tables that we're creating,\n\n45\n00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.150\nor in our relations.\n\n46\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.863\nSo Vonne,\nlet's kinda go through the process here.\n\n47\n00:02:27.863 --> 00:02:31.975\nAnd I think we mentioned already, we'd\nwanna get any documentation that we had,\n\n48\n00:02:31.975 --> 00:02:33.890\nforms and things like that together.\n\n49\n00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.863\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we gotta get our Trapper Keeper\nout and make sure we've got all of our\n\n50\n00:02:37.863 --> 00:02:41.288\npapers that we stuffed into there,\nwith a unicorn on the front.\n\n51\n00:02:41.288 --> 00:02:44.675\nIf you're like what are you talking about,\nwatch part one, lots of fun.\n\n52\n00:02:44.675 --> 00:02:49.039\nYeah so we need to get all of that and\nthen think about what.\n\n53\n00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.086\nCuz I mean, in the form,\nif we're doing a paper form,\n\n54\n00:02:52.086 --> 00:02:56.170\nthat actually might be information\nthat goes into multiple tables.\n\n55\n00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.029\nSo you don't wanna just dump it all into\none cuz that's where we have to think\n\n56\n00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:03.546\nabout how does this all relate to\neach other in the overall database?\n\n57\n00:03:03.546 --> 00:03:05.710\nSo don't just dump it all into one place.\n\n58\n00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.243\n&gt;&gt; Yep, absolutely right.\n\n59\n00:03:06.243 --> 00:03:11.781\nAs you go through that form, think about\nokay, there's a blank here for breed.\n\n60\n00:03:11.781 --> 00:03:14.623\nWell, where would I put breed\nin this spreadsheet here?\n\n61\n00:03:14.623 --> 00:03:16.490\nWould it go under trainers?\n\n62\n00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.044\nProbably not, right?\n\n63\n00:03:17.044 --> 00:03:19.542\nThe term the breed has to do with dogs, so\n\n64\n00:03:19.542 --> 00:03:24.790\nif that is something we wanna track we'd\ngo ahead and put that right over there.\n\n65\n00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.583\nAnd we simply keep going through our lists\nof, again from all those documents or\n\n66\n00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:32.337\nwhat we've discovered from talking to\nour customer, and filling those out.\n\n67\n00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:35.140\nSo Vonne, what are some other things\nwe wanna track about the dogs?\n\n68\n00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.848\n&gt;&gt; Well, we probably want their name.\n\n69\n00:03:35.848 --> 00:03:39.861\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we definitely wanna know\nwhat dog we're talking about, so\n\n70\n00:03:39.861 --> 00:03:41.700\nwe might put name in there.\n\n71\n00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.806\nLet's see what else we want.\nWe wanna know, some of our classes,\n\n72\n00:03:44.806 --> 00:03:48.380\nwe've got puppy classes\nversus adult classes.\n\n73\n00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.920\nWell, what makes a puppy versus an adult?\n\n74\n00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.596\nAnd that's their age, right?\n\n75\n00:03:54.596 --> 00:03:55.608\nSo maybe we need to track that.\n\n76\n00:03:55.608 --> 00:03:59.156\nCuz somebody might try to take their puppy\nand sign it up for an adult class, or\n\n77\n00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:01.298\ntake an adult and\ntry to put it in a puppy class.\n\n78\n00:04:01.298 --> 00:04:04.240\n&gt;&gt; Or would this be maybe their birthday?\n\n79\n00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.810\nBecause I'm thinking if you put age,\nthat's something that's gonna change.\n\n80\n00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.892\nYou put it in that they're\ntwo years old right now, but\n\n81\n00:04:11.892 --> 00:04:14.580\nthen two years later\nthey're going to be four.\n\n82\n00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.051\n2 plus 2 is 4, okay yeah.\n\n83\n00:04:16.051 --> 00:04:20.456\n[LAUGH] So I don't know if that is\nsomething you might need to think about in\n\n84\n00:04:20.456 --> 00:04:21.913\nwhat you're storing.\n\n85\n00:04:21.913 --> 00:04:22.880\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n86\n00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.053\n&gt;&gt; Is it volatile,\nis that what we call it in this show?\n\n87\n00:04:26.053 --> 00:04:29.943\n&gt;&gt; I think it's a great lead in to\nsomething we do need to discuss, and\n\n88\n00:04:29.943 --> 00:04:32.176\nthat's calculated fields, right?\n\n89\n00:04:32.176 --> 00:04:39.090\nSo let's go ahead and\nput DateOfBirth, In there as a field.\n\n90\n00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.910\nSo we can put that in there.\n\n91\n00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.942\nBut again, age, you might think\nwell let's put date of birth and\n\n92\n00:04:45.942 --> 00:04:47.965\nput age in there, right?\n\n93\n00:04:47.965 --> 00:04:50.205\nThere's really a debate on whether or\n\n94\n00:04:50.205 --> 00:04:53.778\nnot you should include calculated\nfields in your database.\n\n95\n00:04:53.778 --> 00:04:56.510\nAnd there's pros and cons to both.\n\n96\n00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.689\nBack when I was learning\nhow to design databases,\n\n97\n00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:04.740\nit was considered a big no-no to put\ncalculated fields within a database.\n\n98\n00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.525\nBecause a calculated field is something\nthat you derive from other fields,\n\n99\n00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:12.226\nlike date of birth, or age, I should say.\n\n100\n00:05:12.226 --> 00:05:16.040\nAge is basically, you're gonna look at\ntheir date of birth and the current date.\n\n101\n00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.167\nFigure out what the difference is and\nnow you ought to know how many years or\n\n102\n00:05:19.167 --> 00:05:20.540\nhow many months old that dog is.\n\n103\n00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.060\nBut as you said, that changes tomorrow.\n\n104\n00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.262\nIt's different from what it was yesterday.\n\n105\n00:05:24.262 --> 00:05:27.088\nIt's different next year when they\nsign up for a different class.\n\n106\n00:05:27.088 --> 00:05:30.060\nSo it's not a static value,\nit's going to be changing.\n\n107\n00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.229\nAnd that means you've gotta\nupdate information, right?\n\n108\n00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:39.745\nThe other school of thought is put\nthe calculated values in there, right?\n\n109\n00:05:39.745 --> 00:05:44.805\nIt's because the reasoning behind this is\nthat can be a lot of work on a server.\n\n110\n00:05:44.805 --> 00:05:49.263\nIf this database is being hosted on\na server, and you're running reports,\n\n111\n00:05:49.263 --> 00:05:52.981\nand it has to do a lot of calculations\nto generate these values.\n\n112\n00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:56.377\nYou're not the only one using that server\nor running reports things like that.\n\n113\n00:05:56.377 --> 00:06:01.052\nIt might put an extra workload on that\nserver to do those calculations every time\n\n114\n00:06:01.052 --> 00:06:03.659\nthat salesperson runs that query, right?\n\n115\n00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:07.786\n&gt;&gt; Well and you're also thinking if you\nhave an organisation like a university or\n\n116\n00:06:07.786 --> 00:06:11.178\na government entity, that can be tons and\ntons of information.\n\n117\n00:06:11.178 --> 00:06:16.558\nIn a dog obedience school, that may\nmean you'd only have one location.\n\n118\n00:06:16.558 --> 00:06:20.520\nOkay, the scope of how much stuff\nyou're gonna be putting into it and\n\n119\n00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.899\nthe processing power.\n\n120\n00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:24.313\nI mean, is that something\nyou might wanna consider?\n\n121\n00:06:24.313 --> 00:06:26.658\nYeah, we can do calculated fields here.\n\n122\n00:06:26.658 --> 00:06:30.068\n&gt;&gt; Yeah definitely, and in my opinion,\nit really depends on the data.\n\n123\n00:06:30.068 --> 00:06:30.841\nBecause, age,\n\n124\n00:06:30.841 --> 00:06:34.882\nI wouldn't put in there because it's gonna\nchange every time I look at this database.\n\n125\n00:06:34.882 --> 00:06:38.659\nIt just wouldn't make sense because\nnow I've got data that's not accurate.\n\n126\n00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:42.403\nIf I go back next month and\nit says that that dog is 13 months,\n\n127\n00:06:42.403 --> 00:06:45.145\nwhen is the last time\nthat field was updated?\n\n128\n00:06:45.145 --> 00:06:48.580\nI have no way of knowing, so I don't know\nif that information is correct or not.\n\n129\n00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.200\nBut if I am talking about a sales database\nand a customer has placed an order.\n\n130\n00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.362\nAnd they've ordered 15 item\nthey are at $1 per item,\n\n131\n00:06:56.362 --> 00:06:59.582\nthe total cost of that order then is $15.\n\n132\n00:06:59.582 --> 00:07:02.360\nWell that $15 is really\na calculated value, right?\n\n133\n00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.930\nI could store the item price is in my\ndatabase somewhere, this costs $1.\n\n134\n00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.220\nIn the order it's gonna have the number\nof items that they've ordered.\n\n135\n00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.960\nSo at any time I could calculate that out,\nbut it's not gonna change.\n\n136\n00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.340\nEvery time I calculate it,\nit's gonna be the same.\n\n137\n00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.610\nIn fact, the price could change, but when\nthe customer ordered it two months ago,\n\n138\n00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:25.527\nit was only $1.\n\n139\n00:07:25.527 --> 00:07:27.060\nNow it's $1.50.\n\n140\n00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.311\nIf I'm using calculated fields and\nif I'm not storing that information and\n\n141\n00:07:32.311 --> 00:07:35.110\nI update the price in the item's table.\n\n142\n00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:40.164\nAnd we go to run a report, it might look\nnow it's gonna multiply 15 times $1.50,\n\n143\n00:07:40.164 --> 00:07:43.120\nwhich is not what the customer\npaid two months ago.\n\n144\n00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.090\nSo now my data's inaccurate again, right?\n\n145\n00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:48.130\n&gt;&gt; Okay, for a minute I got a little lost.\n\n146\n00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:49.677\nI'm like no, I see what you're saying.\n\n147\n00:07:49.677 --> 00:07:55.090\nBecause you're like if you only reply you\nhave that somewhere else, the reports.\n\n148\n00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.181\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; No, you need to keep that because\n\n149\n00:07:57.181 --> 00:08:00.967\nat that point it was a static\npiece of information, so you need-\n\n150\n00:08:00.967 --> 00:08:03.057\n&gt;&gt; Somebody might have bought something on\n\n151\n00:08:03.057 --> 00:08:06.434\nsale and the price was different and\nit's not the price anymore so\n\n152\n00:08:06.434 --> 00:08:09.935\nI think it really depends on the data and\nhow you are using that data to\n\n153\n00:08:09.935 --> 00:08:13.544\ndetermine,should I include a calculated\nfield in my tables or not.\n\n154\n00:08:13.544 --> 00:08:17.166\n&gt;&gt; And maybe cuz you said like this was\na while ago that you were learning about\n\n155\n00:08:17.166 --> 00:08:20.107\nthe stuff now the processing\npower of that computers have.\n\n156\n00:08:20.107 --> 00:08:24.443\nAnd servers have,I mean you might not\nhave as many issues with that possibly?\n\n157\n00:08:24.443 --> 00:08:26.019\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n158\n00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:28.871\nOur computers are much faster\nthan it were years and\n\n159\n00:08:28.871 --> 00:08:31.069\nyears ago that I learned this stuff so.\n\n160\n00:08:31.069 --> 00:08:32.163\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] right.\n\n161\n00:08:32.163 --> 00:08:35.446\n&gt;&gt; I am gonna take age out of their\nbecause I don't think we wanna put that in\n\n162\n00:08:35.446 --> 00:08:38.841\nhere because it's gonna be very\nirrelevant to have the most current age,\n\n163\n00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:42.070\nbecause if they come back, they tried\nto sign up for the adult class but\n\n164\n00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:43.574\nthe dog wasn't old enough yet.\n\n165\n00:08:43.574 --> 00:08:47.838\nTwo months later they come back and try to\nsign up, I need to see that current age,\n\n166\n00:08:47.838 --> 00:08:48.714\nand go, yes,\n\n167\n00:08:48.714 --> 00:08:52.326\nyou'll able to join that class now\nbecause your dog is now an adult.\n\n168\n00:08:52.326 --> 00:08:54.118\nDog dancing is very dangerous thing,\n\n169\n00:08:54.118 --> 00:08:58.047\nso we gotta make sure they're at least two\nyears before they attempt to any of that.\n\n170\n00:08:58.047 --> 00:08:59.008\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and it's very serious.\n\n171\n00:08:59.008 --> 00:09:01.237\nWe take our ballroom dancing serious.\n\n172\n00:09:01.237 --> 00:09:03.265\nYou can't have any\nchildren in there [LAUGH].\n\n173\n00:09:03.265 --> 00:09:06.021\n&gt;&gt; No, no, especially tango,\nthat's a little risque.\n\n174\n00:09:06.021 --> 00:09:07.155\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n175\n00:09:07.155 --> 00:09:10.120\nwe don't want any puppies being\nexposed to that just yet.\n\n176\n00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.097\n&gt;&gt; Their fragile little minds [LAUGH].\n\n177\n00:09:11.097 --> 00:09:12.263\n&gt;&gt; Yes, all right, so\n\n178\n00:09:12.263 --> 00:09:16.185\nwhat's some other things then we\nmight wanna track about our dogs?\n\n179\n00:09:16.185 --> 00:09:19.764\nWe've got name, we've got breed,\nwe've got date of birth.\n\n180\n00:09:19.764 --> 00:09:21.310\nGender might come in to play.\n\n181\n00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:25.007\nIt might be something where we've got\nsome classes that are only for males or\n\n182\n00:09:25.007 --> 00:09:26.932\nsome for females, or maybe we don't.\n\n183\n00:09:26.932 --> 00:09:31.764\nAgain, I'm just kinda going through and\nthrowing some things out there.\n\n184\n00:09:31.764 --> 00:09:33.560\nWhat about classes?\n\n185\n00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:40.442\nWe'd need the name of the class, and\nmaybe we have a description of that class.\n\n186\n00:09:40.442 --> 00:09:44.788\n&gt;&gt; Maybe like the level\nof expertise needed.\n\n187\n00:09:44.788 --> 00:09:45.765\nIs it a level one class?\n\n188\n00:09:45.765 --> 00:09:46.782\nIs it a level two class?\n\n189\n00:09:46.782 --> 00:09:49.347\n&gt;&gt; So we could say level.\n\n190\n00:09:49.347 --> 00:09:52.025\nMaybe that class has a level to it.\n\n191\n00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:54.853\nMaybe it has an age restriction.\n\n192\n00:09:54.853 --> 00:09:56.162\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n193\n00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:57.346\nAnd I am trying to think\nabout some things-\n\n194\n00:09:57.346 --> 00:09:58.813\n&gt;&gt; Or something like that.\n\n195\n00:09:58.813 --> 00:10:04.690\n&gt;&gt; But we wouldn't put the time that\nis scheduled not in this table?\n\n196\n00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:05.528\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n197\n00:10:05.528 --> 00:10:06.139\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n198\n00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:08.128\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be over here\nin my schedule classes.\n\n199\n00:10:08.128 --> 00:10:13.730\nSo in my schedule classes, I still\nneed to know the name of that class.\n\n200\n00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.512\nI don't need the description\ncuz that's not gonna change\n\n201\n00:10:16.512 --> 00:10:18.052\neach time I schedule the class.\n\n202\n00:10:18.052 --> 00:10:21.931\nI would need to know-\n&gt;&gt; The date that it's being run.\n\n203\n00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:27.131\n&gt;&gt; The date that it's being run,\nthe time that it's being run,\n\n204\n00:10:27.131 --> 00:10:31.148\nthe room number that\nthe class is being held in.\n\n205\n00:10:31.148 --> 00:10:35.958\n&gt;&gt; Would you put here, like, what\ntrainer would be teaching the course, or\n\n206\n00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:39.774\nis that not something that\ngoes in this particular table?\n\n207\n00:10:39.774 --> 00:10:43.124\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, I would say that it\nis going to end up going in here.\n\n208\n00:10:43.124 --> 00:10:47.079\nBut at this point, we're really just\ntalking about let's figure out what\n\n209\n00:10:47.079 --> 00:10:50.230\nattributes are describing\nthe object that we're trying.\n\n210\n00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:51.275\nSo let's go ahead and put that in there.\n\n211\n00:10:51.275 --> 00:10:52.976\nLet's go ahead and put trainer.\n\n212\n00:10:52.976 --> 00:10:56.462\nAll right, because that is gonna be\nassigned when we schedule that class.\n\n213\n00:10:56.462 --> 00:11:00.065\n&gt;&gt; And this is what I'm thinking, this is\nprobably what they're gonna wanna trap.\n\n214\n00:11:00.065 --> 00:11:03.591\nWho was the one who taught\nthat class when, but\n\n215\n00:11:03.591 --> 00:11:08.488\njust knowing all of the you put\neverything in different places.\n\n216\n00:11:08.488 --> 00:11:10.669\nIs this the appropriate place and so,\n\n217\n00:11:10.669 --> 00:11:15.589\nI figured let's throw it out there because\nwe're planning, we're moving around.\n\n218\n00:11:15.589 --> 00:11:18.894\n&gt;&gt; It's something that will, if we\nthink back to our data normalization.\n\n219\n00:11:18.894 --> 00:11:23.188\nThis might be something that we look\nat later and go, does trainer apply\n\n220\n00:11:23.188 --> 00:11:27.208\nto the key, nothing but the key and\nthe whole key, so if it was cut.\n\n221\n00:11:27.208 --> 00:11:30.406\nWe´ll have to take a look and\nsee if it stays, it might.\n\n222\n00:11:30.406 --> 00:11:33.466\nIt might not, but\nthat´s the purpose of this exercise.\n\n223\n00:11:33.466 --> 00:11:38.417\nWe´re just getting this preliminary list\nof attributes that we think we are gonna\n\n224\n00:11:38.417 --> 00:11:39.573\nput in our tables.\n\n225\n00:11:39.573 --> 00:11:44.170\nTrainers, well, they´ve got a name, right.\n\n226\n00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:48.566\nBut here's where we think, hmm, wait\na second, what did we learn yesterday?\n\n227\n00:11:48.566 --> 00:11:52.669\nNow a dog's name is probably Sparky,\nor Buster, or\n\n228\n00:11:52.669 --> 00:11:57.628\nFuego, or what have you, but\nwhat's a trainer's name?\n\n229\n00:11:57.628 --> 00:12:01.805\n&gt;&gt; We need a first and a last,\nthe smallest part [LAUGH].\n\n230\n00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:03.146\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n231\n00:12:03.146 --> 00:12:08.363\nAnd so, I could later on, as I go through\nmy normalization realize names not\n\n232\n00:12:08.363 --> 00:12:13.610\ngonna work if I wanna see all the trainers\nthat have a last name that starts with R.\n\n233\n00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.660\nThis isn't gonna help me\nif it's all in one field.\n\n234\n00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.170\nSo it would definitely\ncome up at some point.\n\n235\n00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.490\nBut because I've already\nstudied those normalizations,\n\n236\n00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.886\nforms, I already know that\nthat's not what I am gonna want.\n\n237\n00:12:24.886 --> 00:12:30.033\nSo I can go and do first name and\nI can do last name.\n\n238\n00:12:30.033 --> 00:12:31.580\nSo I kinda get ahead of the game.\n\n239\n00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.296\nOne last thing I got to\nworry about later on.\n\n240\n00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:40.043\nAnd I probably need a way\nto contact a trainer as\n\n241\n00:12:40.043 --> 00:12:44.197\nan email address, if it has an address.\n\n242\n00:12:44.197 --> 00:12:48.462\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and this would be like their\ndemographic information used to these\n\n243\n00:12:48.462 --> 00:12:50.680\ncity,state, zip, phone, email.\n\n244\n00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.640\nNow, I was going to this is another thing.\n\n245\n00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.952\nI'm like well, what about like\nthere's certification level.\n\n246\n00:12:56.952 --> 00:13:00.208\nWhat certifications they have,\nbut then I started thinking.\n\n247\n00:13:00.208 --> 00:13:02.765\nWell, what if they have\nmultiple certifications?\n\n248\n00:13:02.765 --> 00:13:03.535\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n249\n00:13:03.535 --> 00:13:06.969\n&gt;&gt; Or also then we'd have\nprobably need a whole separate\n\n250\n00:13:06.969 --> 00:13:09.911\ntable that tracks certifications-\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.-\n\n251\n00:13:09.911 --> 00:13:10.722\n&gt;&gt; And tie together.\n\n252\n00:13:10.722 --> 00:13:13.366\n&gt;&gt; And we'd have to go back to\nour statement of purpose and\n\n253\n00:13:13.366 --> 00:13:16.988\nwonder why certfications wasn't under\nthere Or even if they do have them,\n\n254\n00:13:16.988 --> 00:13:20.318\nthe customer doesn't feel the need\nto track them, all right?\n\n255\n00:13:20.318 --> 00:13:20.899\n&gt;&gt; Well, there you go.\n\n256\n00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:23.129\nYeah, you could have\na certification in dog dancing.\n\n257\n00:13:23.129 --> 00:13:25.847\nBut for us, we're not having that\n\n258\n00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:30.450\nto be as part of something we\nneed to know in this database.\n\n259\n00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:35.151\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, all right, owners of the dogs,\nthey are gonna have a name, but again,\n\n260\n00:13:35.151 --> 00:13:39.900\nwe'll do first name\nWe'll do the last name.\n\n261\n00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.730\nI know yesterday we talked about the dog\nhaving the address and not the owner.\n\n262\n00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.376\nSo how you feeling about that today?\n\n263\n00:13:45.376 --> 00:13:46.994\nSame way?\n\n264\n00:13:46.994 --> 00:13:49.996\n&gt;&gt; I guess we should stay consistent, or-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n265\n00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:51.902\n&gt;&gt; Let's get crazy.\n\n266\n00:13:51.902 --> 00:13:53.324\nLet's switch it up, I don't know.\n\n267\n00:13:53.324 --> 00:13:54.552\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, let's do that.\n\n268\n00:13:54.552 --> 00:14:02.340\nWe'll do owners have the address,\nthe city the state, the zip.\n\n269\n00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.940\nDefinitely need to contact that owner,\nmaybe they've got an email address.\n\n270\n00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.486\n&gt;&gt; Well yeah, I mean cuz they're the ones\nthat are going to be, sign their dogs up.,\n\n271\n00:14:10.486 --> 00:14:12.019\nI mean, dogs can't read the mail.\n\n272\n00:14:12.019 --> 00:14:13.529\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] right.\n\n273\n00:14:13.529 --> 00:14:15.154\n&gt;&gt; Fuego, get the mail, open the email.\n\n274\n00:14:15.154 --> 00:14:16.534\n&gt;&gt; Not all that many of them.\n\n275\n00:14:16.534 --> 00:14:21.682\n&gt;&gt; Well, I was about to say, some of them\nI'm sure we can make a class, dog reading.\n\n276\n00:14:21.682 --> 00:14:24.060\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I saw a video the other day,\n\n277\n00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.845\nthe guy unloading his groceries and\nthe other plastic grocery sacks.\n\n278\n00:14:26.845 --> 00:14:29.365\nAnd hands it to the dog,\nthe dog takes it and runs it in the house.\n\n279\n00:14:29.365 --> 00:14:32.395\n&gt;&gt; Man I need teach Fuego how to do that.\n\n280\n00:14:32.395 --> 00:14:35.765\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I think at this point we\n\n281\n00:14:35.765 --> 00:14:39.452\nare getting the idea, we are seeing how\njust sitting here and talking about it.\n\n282\n00:14:39.452 --> 00:14:42.760\nAnd again, this is great to\ndo with your stakeholders.\n\n283\n00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.335\nBecause they might point out that, yeah,\n\n284\n00:14:45.335 --> 00:14:48.994\nwe also need to know\nthe certifications about the trainers.\n\n285\n00:14:48.994 --> 00:14:52.691\nAnd okay, and now we're gonna have\nrevisit our statement of purpose and\n\n286\n00:14:52.691 --> 00:14:55.975\ntalk about why you need that or,\nwe don't have room numbers.\n\n287\n00:14:55.975 --> 00:14:57.192\nI mean,\nI wouldn't of ever put that on there.\n\n288\n00:14:57.192 --> 00:14:59.608\nSo it's a matter of trying\nto figure this out.\n\n289\n00:14:59.608 --> 00:15:03.024\nI started this the other day\njust to kind of get an idea and\n\n290\n00:15:03.024 --> 00:15:04.853\nI think we came pretty close.\n\n291\n00:15:04.853 --> 00:15:08.889\nExcept I had address on dog\ninstead of owners, but yeah.\n\n292\n00:15:08.889 --> 00:15:10.270\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's fine.\n\n293\n00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:11.084\n&gt;&gt; I think we're good enough.\n\n294\n00:15:11.084 --> 00:15:12.343\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we get the idea.\n\n295\n00:15:12.343 --> 00:15:13.767\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n296\n00:15:13.767 --> 00:15:18.762\nAll right, so now we've got our\nlist of attributes that we think\n\n297\n00:15:18.762 --> 00:15:22.833\nwe're going to have for\neach one of these entities or\n\n298\n00:15:22.833 --> 00:15:26.643\nobjects that we're going to track,\nall right?\n\n299\n00:15:26.643 --> 00:15:33.036\nOur next phase then, is to figure\nout our keys and our indexes, right.\n\n300\n00:15:33.036 --> 00:15:37.318\nWe want to start thinking about that,\nespecially the primary key.\n\n301\n00:15:37.318 --> 00:15:40.613\nRemember there's different types of keys,\nthere's unique keys,\n\n302\n00:15:40.613 --> 00:15:42.040\nthere's non-unique keys.\n\n303\n00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:47.398\nWe got our primary keys, we got\nforeign keys and then, indexes, right.\n\n304\n00:15:47.398 --> 00:15:52.679\nThat was something that we could add to\na field if it was going to be searchable,\n\n305\n00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:55.969\nor to make it faster as\nfar as the searching goes.\n\n306\n00:15:55.969 --> 00:16:00.655\n&gt;&gt; That was like the sorting of\nthe internal sorting that we\n\n307\n00:16:00.655 --> 00:16:02.655\nwould want to have the.\n\n308\n00:16:02.655 --> 00:16:05.411\nRelational data, the access-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n309\n00:16:05.411 --> 00:16:07.034\n&gt;&gt; To be able to do.\n\n310\n00:16:07.034 --> 00:16:10.920\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and it'll speed up that process,\nthat search process.\n\n311\n00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.320\nSo that's our next phase,\nis to start thinking about that.\n\n312\n00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.940\nSo let's start with the table Dogs.\n\n313\n00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:25.000\nAnd we need to figure out what is going\nto be unique about these, about the dogs.\n\n314\n00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.400\nWhat is it that we have, what columns or\nwhat fields, what potential attributes\n\n315\n00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:36.520\nhere are going to be unique enough\nto uniquely identify our dogs?\n\n316\n00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.525\n&gt;&gt; Well, and this is where maybe\nyou could determine, well,\n\n317\n00:16:40.525 --> 00:16:46.540\nmaybe we should start assigning dogs with\nan employee number or a membership number.\n\n318\n00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:51.390\nJust like my gym membership is, it's got\na specific set of numbers and that's mine.\n\n319\n00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:54.752\nAnd if you're gonna be tracking\nyour dogs maybe that's something.\n\n320\n00:16:54.752 --> 00:16:58.007\nBecause I'm thinking cuz you\ncould have many different breeds,\n\n321\n00:16:58.007 --> 00:16:59.850\nmany different names, all of that.\n\n322\n00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:00.369\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n323\n00:17:00.369 --> 00:17:02.840\nI don't know if we could\nuse any of those fields.\n\n324\n00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.119\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go through that and\n\n325\n00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:06.840\nthat's the exact thought\nprocess that you want to have.\n\n326\n00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.546\nBreed, is that going to be unique for\nevery single row?\n\n327\n00:17:10.546 --> 00:17:12.056\nMost likely not, right?\n\n328\n00:17:12.056 --> 00:17:16.550\nYou could have more than one Pomeranian,\nor husky, or whatever the case may be.\n\n329\n00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:17.630\nSo that's not going to work.\n\n330\n00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:18.688\n&gt;&gt; I almost said Pikachu.\n\n331\n00:17:18.688 --> 00:17:20.775\nI'm like, wait that's not a dog.\n\n332\n00:17:20.775 --> 00:17:21.892\n&gt;&gt; Isn't that a Pokemon?\n\n333\n00:17:21.892 --> 00:17:23.220\n&gt;&gt; It is a Pokemon.\n\n334\n00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.790\nYeah but there's some-\n&gt;&gt; Pekingese, Pekingese?\n\n335\n00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:30.200\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there we go,\nnot Pikachu, Pekingese, yes.\n\n336\n00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.650\n&gt;&gt; All right, Name, well,\nyou think Name might be unique.\n\n337\n00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:37.140\nBut honestly, there could be more than\none Sparky, there's a lot of Spikes and\n\n338\n00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:40.040\nBusters, right, so that's not gonna work.\n\n339\n00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.230\nDate of birth, may very well have two\ndogs that were born on the same day.\n\n340\n00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.670\nIn fact, I have two dogs,\nthey're brother and sister, and\n\n341\n00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:47.870\nthey've got the exact same birthday.\n\n342\n00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.007\nSo that's not going to be unique.\n\n343\n00:17:50.007 --> 00:17:51.936\nGender, definitely not gonna be unique,\nand\n\n344\n00:17:51.936 --> 00:17:53.920\nyou've only got a couple\nto choose from there.\n\n345\n00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.970\nAt least in the dog world, so\nthat's not gonna be unique.\n\n346\n00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:01.455\nSo at this point we're scratching\nour heads going, I don't know.\n\n347\n00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:03.775\nNothing in here will\nwork as a primary key.\n\n348\n00:18:03.775 --> 00:18:07.189\nAnd so Vonne's thought\nprocess was on spot, right?\n\n349\n00:18:07.189 --> 00:18:07.885\nIt was on point.\n\n350\n00:18:07.885 --> 00:18:08.715\n&gt;&gt; On spot.\n\n351\n00:18:08.715 --> 00:18:10.382\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's a good one.\n\n352\n00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:13.631\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which is another very common name.\n\n353\n00:18:13.631 --> 00:18:17.195\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So none of these fields are candidates\n\n354\n00:18:17.195 --> 00:18:21.155\nfor primary key, so\nwe're going to have to do something.\n\n355\n00:18:21.155 --> 00:18:24.900\nWe need to figure out some way\nto identify each row uniquely.\n\n356\n00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:30.020\nAnd in this case no combination,\nwhat about a combination of fields?\n\n357\n00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:34.120\nWould name and\nbreed guarantee me uniqueness?\n\n358\n00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.430\n&gt;&gt; Mm, I don't think any of those\neven if you get all four of them.\n\n359\n00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:38.610\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Really I mean.\n\n360\n00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.430\n&gt;&gt; It really wouldn't.\n\n361\n00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.980\nI mean most likely, but you could have.\n\n362\n00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.540\n&gt;&gt; All four of these,\nbut can't guarantee it.\n\n363\n00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:48.089\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you could have two\nSpots that are Pomeranians that\n\n364\n00:18:48.089 --> 00:18:52.160\nare born on October 1st and\nthey're both male.\n\n365\n00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n366\n00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.650\nAnd the definition of a primary\nkey is it must be unique.\n\n367\n00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:00.850\nIn fact, most RDMS systems,\nit's gonna be unique, and\n\n368\n00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:03.480\nit will not allow you\nto enter a duplicate.\n\n369\n00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.296\nSo all of a sudden you're gonna get stuck\ntrying to enter in this new customer\n\n370\n00:19:06.296 --> 00:19:07.510\nthat's come to you.\n\n371\n00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:10.320\nI can't enter your record\nbecause there's already\n\n372\n00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.810\na Pomeranian named Spot that was\nborn on July 4th that's male.\n\n373\n00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:17.530\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if this is\nthe right time to ask this.\n\n374\n00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:23.040\nBut the composite keys,\nif you have to combine\n\n375\n00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.330\nfour fields to make that a unique value.\n\n376\n00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.540\nIs there a limit of,\nif you've got to do four,\n\n377\n00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.470\nyou should just go ahead and\nmake a membership number, or\n\n378\n00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:38.560\nsome type of column or\nfield that kind of takes that place?\n\n379\n00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.210\n&gt;&gt; There is and there's not a hard,\n\n380\n00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:44.530\nfast rule to it, but really we start\ntalking about database optimization.\n\n381\n00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:47.603\nWhich is not something we're going to\ncover in this particular class, but\n\n382\n00:19:47.603 --> 00:19:49.330\nit is something that we should consider.\n\n383\n00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:53.056\nAnd it goes back to the way\nthe data is actually stored and\n\n384\n00:19:53.056 --> 00:19:57.120\nwhen we create indexes,\na copy of the primary key is stored.\n\n385\n00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.190\nThe index is separate from the table and\n\n386\n00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:03.812\na copy of the primary key is stored\nwith that entry as it makes this index.\n\n387\n00:20:03.812 --> 00:20:04.657\n&gt;&gt; Sorry.\n\n388\n00:20:04.657 --> 00:20:09.027\n&gt;&gt; And so if the index is five columns, I\ngotta store five columns worth of data for\n\n389\n00:20:09.027 --> 00:20:10.232\nevery single entry.\n\n390\n00:20:10.232 --> 00:20:13.890\nAnd it starts duplicating,\nwe are storing the data more than once.\n\n391\n00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:17.132\nAnd it makes our data,\nour database itself bloated.\n\n392\n00:20:17.132 --> 00:20:20.700\n&gt;&gt; That was my internal voice going,\nyeah that makes sense.\n\n393\n00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.273\nIt just kind of let out-\n&gt;&gt; It was a loud light bulb.\n\n394\n00:20:23.273 --> 00:20:27.298\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sorry [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That makes whole sense.\n\n395\n00:20:27.298 --> 00:20:32.742\nAnd I guess if you only have ten columns,\nyou have ten fields and\n\n396\n00:20:32.742 --> 00:20:38.640\nfive of them combined make the unique or\nthe primary key.\n\n397\n00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.231\nMaybe that's kind of stretching\nif you had 100 columns and 5,\n\n398\n00:20:42.231 --> 00:20:44.810\nI don't know if that has\nanything to do with it.\n\n399\n00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:48.727\n&gt;&gt; Not really, I would still think storing\nfive columns of information multiple times\n\n400\n00:20:48.727 --> 00:20:51.221\nis not good no matter how\nmany other columns you have.\n\n401\n00:20:51.221 --> 00:20:53.760\n&gt;&gt; Well, I guess that negates my\nlightbulb moment that just happened.\n\n402\n00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.777\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Do we have a verbal over that, aw.\n\n403\n00:20:57.777 --> 00:21:00.856\n&gt;&gt; No [LAUGH] No, Vonne, that was wrong.\n\n404\n00:21:00.856 --> 00:21:02.252\nYou just totally went around in circles.\n\n405\n00:21:02.252 --> 00:21:03.850\n&gt;&gt; The thought process was correct, right?\n\n406\n00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:05.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And that's the kinda thing that we're\n\n407\n00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.120\ntrying to do here is teach you that\n\n408\n00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:11.300\nthought process that I should have as\nI'm going through this design process.\n\n409\n00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:16.050\nSo in this case no combination,\nthere is no potential or primary key here.\n\n410\n00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:19.370\nSo it makes more sense\njust to create our own.\n\n411\n00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:23.172\nMost books you read will tell\nyou that it's a design decision,\n\n412\n00:21:23.172 --> 00:21:24.830\nthat either way will work.\n\n413\n00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:29.021\nIf you could use a composite primary\nkey or a composite primary key, or\n\n414\n00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:32.110\ncreate your own even if\nit's only two fields.\n\n415\n00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:36.180\nI might choose to say, you know\nwhat I'd much rather create my own.\n\n416\n00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.690\nThere are designs out there\n\n417\n00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:43.590\nwhere even though there is a single field\nthat could be used for a primary key.\n\n418\n00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.230\nThere is already an existing field\nthat's unique for every single row.\n\n419\n00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:51.170\nThey'll make an ID column anyway.\n\n420\n00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:52.940\nIt's just the way they're\nused to working with it.\n\n421\n00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:57.030\nIt makes more sense logically, It's easy\nto work with when your writing queries.\n\n422\n00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:02.220\nCuz you know if it's classes, most likely\nI'm gonna create a field called class ID.\n\n423\n00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.860\nIf it's trainers,\nI'll make a field called trainer ID.\n\n424\n00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:08.680\nSo it's very easy to recall what\nthe primary key is for that entity, or for\n\n425\n00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.170\nthat relation.\n\n426\n00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:15.950\n&gt;&gt; I'm also thinking when I go to the gym,\nwhen I actually get there [LAUGH].\n\n427\n00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:19.708\nThey always say, well,\ngive me your membership ID,\n\n428\n00:22:19.708 --> 00:22:22.790\nbecause everything is tied to that.\n\n429\n00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:28.295\nSo that becomes a very important thing\nthat you're going to need to track and\n\n430\n00:22:28.295 --> 00:22:30.365\nrelate to.\n\n431\n00:22:31.485 --> 00:22:36.065\nOkay, yeah, we're gonna do dog IDs\nbecause in this particular obedience\n\n432\n00:22:36.065 --> 00:22:39.367\nschool that's how we're\ngoing to kind of track and\n\n433\n00:22:39.367 --> 00:22:44.127\nconnect everything within this database,\nand really the organization as a whole.\n\n434\n00:22:44.127 --> 00:22:46.557\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because it could even stretch\nbeyond the database itself, right?\n\n435\n00:22:46.557 --> 00:22:48.267\nThat same number could\nbe used in other places.\n\n436\n00:22:48.267 --> 00:22:53.489\nSo well, let's do that, let's go ahead and\ncreate a DogID type field.\n\n437\n00:22:53.489 --> 00:22:56.467\nAll right, now let's stop here for\njust a second.\n\n438\n00:22:56.467 --> 00:22:58.767\nI want to go back and\ntalk about some of these names and\n\n439\n00:22:58.767 --> 00:23:00.660\nnaming inventions that I've been using.\n\n440\n00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:02.450\nI don't think we really mentioned it.\n\n441\n00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:05.970\nI do wanna point out that if you look at\nthe names of my tables, Dogs, Classes,\n\n442\n00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:09.550\nScheduledClasses, Trainers, Owners,\nwhat's the commonality there?\n\n443\n00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:12.360\n&gt;&gt; I notice you're not using\nany spaces there, Mike.\n\n444\n00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.800\n&gt;&gt; I'm definitely not using spaces, right?\n\n445\n00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.070\n&gt;&gt; Or\nis that not what we're talking about yet?\n\n446\n00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.870\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That was not, but\n\n447\n00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:17.127\nthat's another good point.\n\n448\n00:23:17.127 --> 00:23:20.690\n[LAUGH] That is common amongst all\nthose titles, so you're right on.\n\n449\n00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:25.293\nBut ScheduledClasses,\nI used kind of a hybrid camel notation,\n\n450\n00:23:25.293 --> 00:23:27.690\nI forget the gentleman's name.\n\n451\n00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:31.050\nIt was, gosh that's gonna bother me now.\n\n452\n00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:31.740\n&gt;&gt; Do you want me to look it up?\n\n453\n00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:32.700\n&gt;&gt; I'll figure it out after a bit.\n\n454\n00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:36.800\nYeah, you can Google camel back\nnotation or something like that.\n\n455\n00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.316\n&gt;&gt; I'm like what am I looking up [LAUGH]?\n\n456\n00:23:39.316 --> 00:23:42.582\n&gt;&gt; Because the words kind of go capital,\ncapital, capital.\n\n457\n00:23:42.582 --> 00:23:44.390\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Camel back, hump.\n\n458\n00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:47.540\nMost of them will show the first\nletters not capitalized and\n\n459\n00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:51.150\nthen the first letter of each\nadditional word is capitalized.\n\n460\n00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:55.710\nI like to capitalize all the words, just\nbecause I find myself typing it that way.\n\n461\n00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:59.260\nBecause I'm used to using Shift\nat the beginning of a word,\n\n462\n00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.964\nand then I have to go back and\ngo lower case.\n\n463\n00:24:01.964 --> 00:24:03.668\nAnd then uppercase, all right.\n\n464\n00:24:03.668 --> 00:24:10.050\nBut whatever you do, some of these\nnewer RDMSes will allow spaces.\n\n465\n00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:13.880\nI will tell you that spaces can goof\nyou up when you're writing queries and\n\n466\n00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.950\nwhen you're working with\nstuff programmatically.\n\n467\n00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:17.890\nAll of a sudden I have to put\nquotes around everything.\n\n468\n00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:22.060\nBecause, remember if there is a space, a\ncomputer sees that as the end of the word.\n\n469\n00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:26.334\nIt doesn't necessarily know that the next\nword is related to the previous word.\n\n470\n00:24:26.334 --> 00:24:29.940\nBecause there's a space between them,\nit just sees a string of characters.\n\n471\n00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:34.770\nSo now I have to put quotes around all\nthe words to tell the computer that\n\n472\n00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:39.170\nscheduled space classes is one thing,\nnot two things.\n\n473\n00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:42.280\nAgain, that starts when we start\nworking with it programmatically,\n\n474\n00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.950\nthat's typically where we'll see that.\n\n475\n00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.090\nSo I´d say a best practice,\n\n476\n00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:49.800\njust to make good forming habits,\ndon't use spaces in your names.\n\n477\n00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.290\n&gt;&gt; Okay-\n&gt;&gt; Did you find it?\n\n478\n00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:52.020\n&gt;&gt; Camel case?\n\n479\n00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.160\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Yes and\n\n480\n00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.530\nit was from a Jacob Berzelius-\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n481\n00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:00.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit was from a Swedish chemist that was\n\n482\n00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:05.190\none of the first persons that started to a\nmore systematic and widespread use of it.\n\n483\n00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.000\n&gt;&gt; Very good, so there you go, right?\n\n484\n00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.880\nAnd if you've got some other\nmethod that you like to use,\n\n485\n00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.930\nsome people like to use underscores.\n\n486\n00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:16.100\nThose are typically allowed characters and\nthey might make it a little more readable.\n\n487\n00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:23.390\nWhere if I do scheduled_classes, like\nthat, it's a little more human-readable.\n\n488\n00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.370\nI can also not worry about the Shift key,\n\n489\n00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:28.870\nbecause that's something extra my\nlittle pinky has to reach out and do.\n\n490\n00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:32.540\nSo if you're not a great typer, maybe\nyou wanna go with something like that.\n\n491\n00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.810\nBut, whatever you do, try to avoid spaces.\n\n492\n00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:39.350\nAnd the other thing I was gonna point\nout is they're plural, all right.\n\n493\n00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:40.930\nDoes it affect my functionality?\n\n494\n00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:42.150\nAbsolutely not!\n\n495\n00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:47.570\nBut this is a table of owners,\nnot a table of an owner, right?\n\n496\n00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.280\nThere's gonna be more than\none owner in that table.\n\n497\n00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.930\nSo we typically name our relations, or\n\n498\n00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:56.195\nour tables,\nthe plural form of the noun, right?\n\n499\n00:25:56.195 --> 00:26:00.630\nJust good best practices to get into,\nright?\n\n500\n00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:06.170\nHeck, back in the day when I learned this,\nit was tblDogs, right?\n\n501\n00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.813\nBecause we could also have\nan index called dogs.\n\n502\n00:26:08.813 --> 00:26:09.928\nWe could have a primary key.\n\n503\n00:26:09.928 --> 00:26:15.570\nAnd so you'd be like, indDogs,\nand things like that.\n\n504\n00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:18.540\n&gt;&gt; And that's what Ronnie\ndoes in the Access class.\n\n505\n00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:22.116\nCuz, everything, if you were doing\na Query would have qry, right?\n\n506\n00:26:22.116 --> 00:26:23.576\nAnd then-\n&gt;&gt; Rpt.\n\n507\n00:26:23.576 --> 00:26:29.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so then you have a dogs table,\ndogs query, dogs report, all of that.\n\n508\n00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:34.180\nSo it's easily recognizable when\nyou're looking at that list in Access\n\n509\n00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:35.695\nlike what exactly is this.\n\n510\n00:26:35.695 --> 00:26:37.800\n&gt;&gt; Kinda differentiate between\nthe different objects that might have\n\n511\n00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.940\nvery similar or common names.\n\n512\n00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:43.145\n&gt;&gt; And those are naming conventions\nthat have kind of come along\n\n513\n00:26:43.145 --> 00:26:47.880\nthrough the ages of people using\ndatabases, this has become the convention.\n\n514\n00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:52.501\nIt's not a rule, but everybody does it,\nso you should do it too.\n\n515\n00:26:52.501 --> 00:26:54.399\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, and\n\n516\n00:26:54.399 --> 00:26:58.330\nthen same thing with my fields,\nthose spaces in my field names.\n\n517\n00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:03.930\nI try to keep them short and\nto the point, but not cryptic, okay?\n\n518\n00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:07.560\nFor date of birth,\nDOB would probably work,\n\n519\n00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.530\nbecause most people are gonna\nunderstand what that is.\n\n520\n00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:14.010\nIt's a pretty commonly used one.\n\n521\n00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:20.001\nBut I probably wouldn't do AR for\nage restriction, right?\n\n522\n00:27:20.001 --> 00:27:21.890\nIt's just,\nit's only gonna make sense to me.\n\n523\n00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:23.860\nAnd to somebody else working with it be,\nwhat the heck is that?\n\n524\n00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:28.010\nSo try to use short, to the point, but\n\n525\n00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:32.740\nstill descriptive names when\nyou're naming your fields.\n\n526\n00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:36.100\nAnd they need to describe, remember,\nI've been using the term field.\n\n527\n00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.300\nI don't think we did that the other day.\n\n528\n00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.300\nWe kinda started that today.\n\n529\n00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.260\nField is another name for a column.\n\n530\n00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:44.050\nA lot of my RDMS systems,\nlike Access, denotes them as fields.\n\n531\n00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:48.060\nSo, if you're looking at any Microsoft\ndocumentation, you'll see the word field,\n\n532\n00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:53.350\nunderstand they're talking about column,\nwhich we can also call a domain, right?\n\n533\n00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:55.013\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So many names.\n\n534\n00:27:55.013 --> 00:27:55.581\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n535\n00:27:55.581 --> 00:27:56.511\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you did mention it.\n\n536\n00:27:56.511 --> 00:27:58.996\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, be like, yeah, we probably should\n\n537\n00:27:58.996 --> 00:28:01.990\nstart saying fields and-\n&gt;&gt; And it really comes down to whether\n\n538\n00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:06.920\nyou're doing this from the mathematician\nside versus the publisher side when\n\n539\n00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:11.230\nyou start looking at some of these\nnames that we use for those.\n\n540\n00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:13.480\nAll right, so where are we at?\n\n541\n00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:18.750\nSo we got our fields listed out or\nour columns that we're gonna have.\n\n542\n00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:23.586\nThe next thing we wanna try\nto do is work with our.\n\n543\n00:28:23.586 --> 00:28:26.560\nI'm sorry, we started primary keys,\nso we were working with keys.\n\n544\n00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.360\nSo we got DogID here.\n\n545\n00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.400\nWhat about for classes?\n\n546\n00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.515\nDo we have anything in here\nthat's gonna be unique?\n\n547\n00:28:33.515 --> 00:28:38.175\n&gt;&gt; Well,\ncould the class name be unique, or?\n\n548\n00:28:38.175 --> 00:28:39.675\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would think so.\n\n549\n00:28:39.675 --> 00:28:40.790\nI don't think we're gonna have.\n&gt;&gt; We don't have any\n\n550\n00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:42.790\nclasses that are the exact same name.\n\n551\n00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:45.610\n&gt;&gt; Right, you wouldn't have\na class called Dog Dancing and\n\n552\n00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:50.040\nanother class called Dog Dancing that were\ndifferent, cuz it wouldn't make sense.\n\n553\n00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.830\n&gt;&gt; Well I guess if we have\nthe levels separated out,\n\n554\n00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:58.080\nyou could have dog dancing level one,\ndog dancing level two, so maybe.\n\n555\n00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:58.660\n&gt;&gt; Great point.\n\n556\n00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:59.717\n&gt;&gt; Okay, hey, yeah.\n\n557\n00:28:59.717 --> 00:29:00.580\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n558\n00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:05.440\nmaybe name is not gonna be a candidate for\na primary key.\n\n559\n00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.780\nMaybe a combination of name and level-\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say that [LAUGH].\n\n560\n00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.360\n&gt;&gt; Would be a primary key, right?\n\n561\n00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.230\nSo let's do this,\nlet's go ahead and mark this.\n\n562\n00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:17.300\nUsually, when you're\nsetting the primary keys,\n\n563\n00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.720\na lot of times what you'll see, a common\nway to do it is just to underline it.\n\n564\n00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.710\nAnd that's indicating that\nthat is my primary key.\n\n565\n00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:28.777\nOr you might do something like this,\nI put PK out next to it.\n\n566\n00:29:28.777 --> 00:29:31.810\nEither way you wanna go is fine with me.\n\n567\n00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:33.240\nDon't think it's gonna matter.\n\n568\n00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.739\nReally just depends on,\nif I'm doing this on paper,\n\n569\n00:29:35.739 --> 00:29:36.898\nI might just-\n&gt;&gt; Might circle it.\n\n570\n00:29:36.898 --> 00:29:41.232\n&gt;&gt; Put an asterisk or circle the one\nthat I think is going to be.\n\n571\n00:29:41.232 --> 00:29:43.939\nI did forget too, and\nI know we're getting short on time, so\n\n572\n00:29:43.939 --> 00:29:46.130\nI guess we should just\nfinish up our primary key.\n\n573\n00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:51.150\nSo let's set the name and\nthe level as a composite primary, oops!\n\n574\n00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:52.480\nA composite primary key.\n\n575\n00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.625\n&gt;&gt; I do that all the time.\n\n576\n00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:54.150\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n577\n00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:55.910\nI'm so used to holding the last\n\n578\n00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:57.060\noption there.\n\n579\n00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.890\nAll right, scheduled classes.\n\n580\n00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:02.910\nSo how do we make this one unique?\n\n581\n00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:05.000\n&gt;&gt; Hmm.\n[LAUGH]\n\n582\n00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.869\n&gt;&gt; Name won't be enough, right,\n\n583\n00:30:06.869 --> 00:30:11.430\nbecause I'm gonna offer swimming and\ndock diving more than once.\n\n584\n00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:14.400\nSo it's gonna appear in my\nScheduledClasses many times.\n\n585\n00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.272\n&gt;&gt; Maybe the name and the date?\n\n586\n00:30:16.272 --> 00:30:18.780\n&gt;&gt; The date, I'm thinking,\nyeah, the name and the date.\n\n587\n00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:22.840\nAnd this is where, depending on your\nbusiness, do we run swimming and\n\n588\n00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.460\ndock diving twice a day, all right?\n\n589\n00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.480\nWell, then name and\ndate wouldn't be enough.\n\n590\n00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.760\nI'd wanna do name, date,\nand time, all right?\n\n591\n00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:35.390\nIn my opinion, in this one I'm gonna start\nusing, I will tell you even for classes,\n\n592\n00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:39.590\nthis is just me,\nI would set my own primary key field.\n\n593\n00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:44.115\nLike instead of using\nthis combination here.\n\n594\n00:30:44.115 --> 00:30:45.690\nOops, let's redo that.\n\n595\n00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:49.800\nI would have come in here and do ClassID,\n\n596\n00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.390\njust because to me it's\neasier to work with.\n\n597\n00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:56.380\nAnd, again,\nthat's a complete design decision.\n\n598\n00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.290\nSomething that you've got to work out.\n\n599\n00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:04.164\n&gt;&gt; And I feel that the, I haven't\nhad a lot of experience in database,\n\n600\n00:31:04.164 --> 00:31:10.564\nbut it almost seems almost every table\nhad that like an ID column or field.\n\n601\n00:31:10.564 --> 00:31:14.650\nAnd whatever it was, that's just\nthe number that was assigned to it.\n\n602\n00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:16.828\nOr like invoice number or\nsomething to that effect.\n\n603\n00:31:16.828 --> 00:31:22.140\nOr just an auto number, like I know\nwe talked about like the relevance or\n\n604\n00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.170\nlike the meaning behind, well,\n\n605\n00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:27.400\nif it's just a random number that doesn't\ndo anything for it, then why use it?\n\n606\n00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.024\nBut-\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\n\n607\n00:31:28.024 --> 00:31:32.300\nit's something that you're gonna have\nto think about, what works for you?\n\n608\n00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.830\nFor scheduled classes, again,\n\n609\n00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:39.720\nwhen I start seeing that I'm gonna have to\ninclude name and date and possibly time.\n\n610\n00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:45.030\nOr if we run two at the same date at the\nsame time, are they in different rooms?\n\n611\n00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:46.300\nHow does that work out?\n\n612\n00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:54.490\nThis is probably another one\nwhere I simply add a SchClassID,\n\n613\n00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:59.420\njust to make it short, sweet, and\neasy to work with in the future.\n\n614\n00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:00.360\n&gt;&gt; Again, back to that whole,\n\n615\n00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:04.560\nwhy you have invoice numbers\non any receipt that you have.\n\n616\n00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.490\nThat's just, hey, this is the instance\nthat we ran the class, so\n\n617\n00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:12.010\nit's going to have a specific\ncode that's associated with it.\n\n618\n00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:14.370\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so\nI'm just gonna kinda go through here.\n\n619\n00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.570\nFor trainers, same concept.\n\n620\n00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:18.130\nMost likely I could combine first name and\n\n621\n00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:21.460\nlast name and be unique,\nbut you can never know.\n\n622\n00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:26.850\nSo, I might have have\nTrainerID in there and\n\n623\n00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:31.240\nthen I'll put OwnerID in there as well,\nand\n\n624\n00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.120\nwe will underline both of those.\n\n625\n00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:40.250\nAnd so now we have our tables, right.\n\n626\n00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:43.190\nWe've got our attributes that we're\ngonna include in the tables, and\n\n627\n00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:44.560\nwe've talked to our primary key.\n\n628\n00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.240\nWe've got a few more things to talk about,\n\n629\n00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:50.020\nthough, when it comes to attributes\nbefore we move on from this phase.\n\n630\n00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.230\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so that means we're going to have\nto come back for more parts, aren't we?\n\n631\n00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:53.840\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we are.\n\n632\n00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:54.360\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n633\n00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.580\nWell, this was good,\nwe've got all of our primary keys.\n\n634\n00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.390\nGreat stopping point, by the way.\n\n635\n00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:00.568\nIt must be like you planned this.\n\n636\n00:33:00.568 --> 00:33:01.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Did\n\n637\n00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:03.610\nyou do some designing of your course?\n\n638\n00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:04.770\n&gt;&gt; Maybe a little bit, right.\n\n639\n00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:05.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we do that.\n\n640\n00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.090\n&gt;&gt; We talked about that proper planning.\n\n641\n00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:09.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, prevents poor performance.\n\n642\n00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:10.960\n&gt;&gt; Prevents poor performance.\n\n643\n00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, we don't just.\n\n644\n00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.000\nWe say this isn't scripted, and it's not.\n\n645\n00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.940\nBut we do think about what we're\ntalking about most of the time so.\n\n646\n00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:21.620\n[LAUGH] All right, well,\nlet's go ahead and sign off now.\n\n647\n00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:24.200\nFor OfficeProTV I've been\nyour host Vonne Smith.\n\n648\n00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:24.940\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:26.137\nWe had a little bit more to talk about and\nhere to help us with that, is Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:26.137 --> 00:00:27.060\nMike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.390\nI'm so glad you're back, hi.\n\n8\n00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.360\n&gt;&gt; Hey, thanks for having me back.\n\n9\n00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.802\nHello, excited to be here as always,\non good old Office.ProTV.\n\n10\n00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:35.939\nAnd yeah, we were talking about\nreferential integrity and\n\n11\n00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:37.640\nI showed you how to redefine it.\n\n12\n00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.920\nAnd we showed you how to\nimplement it in Access,\n\n13\n00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.880\nthe RDMS that I happen to be using.\n\n14\n00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.940\nMight be slightly different in\nwhatever you're using of course,\n\n15\n00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.920\nbut the concept is the same, right?\n\n16\n00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.840\nReferential integrity is gonna\nmake sure of a few things, right?\n\n17\n00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.071\nIt's gonna keep that integrity\nbetween our relationships or\n\n18\n00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:58.090\nthe relationships between the relations.\n\n19\n00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.657\nAnd remember what\na relationship is based on.\n\n20\n00:01:00.657 --> 00:01:03.650\nYou've got a primary key in one table.\n\n21\n00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.940\nThat primary key is unique and not known,\nuniquely identifies every row.\n\n22\n00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.160\nBut I have another table that I wanna\n\n23\n00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.070\nput a copy of that column that\nprimary key column in another table.\n\n24\n00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.700\nSo, it becomes a foreign key, right?\n\n25\n00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.620\nAnd so we think about a customer's\ntable one row for each customer.\n\n26\n00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.050\nBut in the orders table that customer\nshould place several orders.\n\n27\n00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.220\nSo you get that one to many relationship,\nthe customer ID in the customer's table.\n\n28\n00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.590\nIs the primary key can only exist once,\nit can't be null.\n\n29\n00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.420\nBut the customer ID and\nthe orders table is the foreign key.\n\n30\n00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.220\nThe copy of the primary key but\nit can exist many times, right?\n\n31\n00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.055\nAnd so we wanna make sure that that\nrelationship doesn't get lose it's\n\n32\n00:01:48.055 --> 00:01:50.620\nintegrity and how could we do that?\n\n33\n00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.120\nWell what if again thin about your\ncostumers and your orders table.\n\n34\n00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.880\nWhat if I had a costumer and\nsay their ID is costumer one?\n\n35\n00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.800\nAnd in my orders, today, well they've\nplaced several orders over the years.\n\n36\n00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.560\nAnd it's referenced by or\nthe relationship's by the customer ID.\n\n37\n00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.090\nNow I delete the customer\nfrom the customer's table.\n\n38\n00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.765\nAlso and I've got all of these orders that\nhave a customer ID that supposed to tie\n\n39\n00:02:16.765 --> 00:02:18.560\nback to the customer's table.\n\n40\n00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.570\nBut that customer doesn't exist\nanymore because somebody deleted it.\n\n41\n00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.350\nNow I've got these orphaned records and\nIve lost my referential integrity or\n\n42\n00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.330\nupdating one, right.\n\n43\n00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.440\nWhat if I changed the customer ID?\n\n44\n00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.380\nThat didn't change the customer ID on all\nthose foreign key fields that it's in.\n\n45\n00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.850\nAnd now again,\nwe've lost that referential integrity.\n\n46\n00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\nwe went through different examples\n\n47\n00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.540\nas to why you would want to have\nreferential integrity or not.\n\n48\n00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.080\nIn a sense like okay, cuz when you were\njust saying well there's still orders.\n\n49\n00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.030\nBut you might wanna keep the orders\nthere and not have them tied together.\n\n50\n00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.480\nSo I'm like, turn it off, but\nhey if this customer goes away here and\n\n51\n00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.770\nit's in the loyalty program, or whatever.\n\n52\n00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.950\nThat needs to go away together and\n\n53\n00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.290\nthat's why you want to have\nreferential integrity.\n\n54\n00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.220\nBut when we're doing that in Access I\nremember there's two little check\n\n55\n00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.580\nboxes underneath.\n\n56\n00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.600\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; That was the whole update and delete.\n\n57\n00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.515\nAnd I know you kind of referenced that.\n\n58\n00:03:19.515 --> 00:03:20.840\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; So is that why we're back?\n\n59\n00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.022\n&gt;&gt; That is why we're back, exactly right.\n\n60\n00:03:23.022 --> 00:03:24.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So quick rehash then.\n\n61\n00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.600\nReferential integrity can't enter a form\nkey value if a primary key value doesn't\n\n62\n00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.070\nexist, all right?\n\n63\n00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.860\nSo I can't enter in an order\nusing a customer ID that\n\n64\n00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.310\ndoesn't already exist\nin the customers table.\n\n65\n00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.260\nAnd while we're talking about it,\nlet me pull up my Relationships.\n\n66\n00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.920\nAnd I'm gonna go grab this relationship\nbetween class trainers and trainers.\n\n67\n00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.150\nAnd we've enforced referential integrity.\n\n68\n00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.047\nThat means I can't use a trainer ID\nin the classes trainer's table if it\n\n69\n00:03:52.047 --> 00:03:55.520\ndoesn't already exist\nas a primary key here.\n\n70\n00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.508\nIt keeps me from miss inputting data or\nincorrectly inputting data.\n\n71\n00:03:59.508 --> 00:04:02.610\nIf I mistyped a trainer ID,\nit's gonna say,\n\n72\n00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.270\nthere is no trainer with that ID,\nyou can't do that.\n\n73\n00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.380\nThat's referential integrity,\nthat's what we turned on there.\n\n74\n00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.720\nCan't delete a primary key\nif a matching record exists.\n\n75\n00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:20.220\nSo if I had said, trainer ID 2001\nit can teach these classes right?\n\n76\n00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.000\nIf they've already in the table and\n\n77\n00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.200\nthey've already have classes\nthat they can teach.\n\n78\n00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.380\nI can't delete that trainer ID because\nthen these records would be orphans.\n\n79\n00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.285\nThey would have nothing\nto reference back to.\n\n80\n00:04:32.285 --> 00:04:36.900\nThey'd go to look up the trainer id and\nthe trainer id wouldn't exist anymore.\n\n81\n00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.740\nSo you can't delete a primary key\nif they're all records matching.\n\n82\n00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.795\nNow let's say I entered in a new trainer.\n\n83\n00:04:45.795 --> 00:04:51.020\nHe's got an id and everything but I have\nnever put it into the classes trainers.\n\n84\n00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.900\nSo he's new, he\"s not qualified to teach\nanything yet and I wanna delete him.\n\n85\n00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.370\nI can delete him because\nthere's no records referencing\n\n86\n00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.580\nthat trainer ID yet, right?\n\n87\n00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.110\nSo that would be allowed.\n\n88\n00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.540\nBut if they had already started teaching\nclasses and we're in this table.\n\n89\n00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.881\nI could not delete that trainer\nbecause there are records that\n\n90\n00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:14.310\nare dependent on that trainer ID.\n\n91\n00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.460\nYou can't change the primary key\nvalue if matching records exist.\n\n92\n00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.400\nAnother thing that we got by turning\non in forced referential integrity.\n\n93\n00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.999\nSo another words I can't go and\nupdate the trainer ID if there's already\n\n94\n00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.140\nrecords that are batching, okay?\n\n95\n00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.170\nLet's take a look at that real quick.\n\n96\n00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:41.150\nSo if we go back to that trainers table\nand we're gonna enter in a new trainer.\n\n97\n00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.180\nSo let's see, let's give it an ID of 8.\n\n98\n00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.345\nAnd this will be Mike Rodrick,\n\n99\n00:05:47.345 --> 00:05:52.470\nI'm just gonna put some\nquick information in here\n\n100\n00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.921\nWrite an email address,I don't like\nemail address as you can required.\n\n101\n00:06:01.921 --> 00:06:04.382\nLet's say that mike@itpro.tv.\n\n102\n00:06:04.382 --> 00:06:07.530\nAll right,so I have got a trainer ID of 8.\n\n103\n00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:14.310\nBut if I look at the classes trainers,\nRodrick is not in this list.\n\n104\n00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:20.870\nSo, but, but, but here it is, I'll use but\nsince I used but, but, but, we'll use but.\n\n105\n00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.690\nI go over here to trainer's table,\nI can delete this record,\n\n106\n00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.820\nwhich includes that primary key value 8.\n\n107\n00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.060\nAnd it lets me, no problem.\n\n108\n00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.340\nBecause there were no records\nreferenced by that primary key.\n\n109\n00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.170\nBut if I go and\ntry to delete James up here.\n\n110\n00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.600\nIt says, the record cannot be deleted or\n\n111\n00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.040\nchanged because table classes\ntrainer includes related records.\n\n112\n00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:52.190\nBecause I've already added him in here,\nI can't delete that primary key record.\n\n113\n00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.737\nOr that record I can't change his ID,\neither.\n\n114\n00:06:56.737 --> 00:07:00.240\nI try to get out of there, it says\nno you can't delete it or change it.\n\n115\n00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.260\nBecause you're going to lose\nyour referential integrity.\n\n116\n00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.010\n&gt;&gt; At first I'm like no you\njust typed them all in.\n\n117\n00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.215\nBut it was because you clicked off of\nit or something that like committed it?\n\n118\n00:07:09.215 --> 00:07:12.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah access,\nthe way access works is as you're typing,\n\n119\n00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.600\nyou'll see this little pencil\nicon comes up right there.\n\n120\n00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.770\nThat let's you know you're in edit mode.\n\n121\n00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.970\nAnd until you get off of this row,\n&gt;&gt; The whole row.\n\n122\n00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:23.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n123\n00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.850\n&gt;&gt; Ok cuz it thinks that\nyou're it's the tuple in here,\n\n124\n00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.310\nyou're probably going along and\nthis record.\n\n125\n00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.026\nOkay that makes.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n126\n00:07:30.026 --> 00:07:30.850\n&gt;&gt; And so if [CROSSTALK] this.\n\n127\n00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.090\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense.\n\n128\n00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.870\n&gt;&gt; It's a great FYI cuz I run\ninto this question all the time.\n\n129\n00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.230\nI've started entering in data,\nit won't let me enter the data.\n\n130\n00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.190\nBut now I'm stuck in this edit mode and\n\n131\n00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.900\nI can't click away from it\nbecause it gives me the error.\n\n132\n00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.200\nI don't remember what the value,\nyou just hit ESC.\n\n133\n00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.910\nIf you're ever in edit mode and\nyou wanna stop editiing and\n\n134\n00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.460\nundo your changes hit Esc.\n\n135\n00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.530\nAnd it drops out of edit mode and it turns\nout, notice the one went back to a one.\n\n136\n00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.568\nIt says I'm gonna throw everything\nyou did away and just go back.\n\n137\n00:07:57.568 --> 00:08:02.642\n&gt;&gt; Because that particular field,\nwe didn't have any other things on it that\n\n138\n00:08:02.642 --> 00:08:07.647\nwas like there wasn't a warning\nright away once You left that field.\n\n139\n00:08:07.647 --> 00:08:08.228\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n140\n00:08:08.228 --> 00:08:12.027\n&gt;&gt; Then some of the other ways that\nwe control things in the domain\n\n141\n00:08:12.027 --> 00:08:15.560\nintegrity episodes,\nthey're not applied here yet.\n\n142\n00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.438\nSo that's why it kind of did that,\nthat could be misleading, especially-\n\n143\n00:08:19.438 --> 00:08:20.190\n&gt;&gt; It's a little tricky.\n\n144\n00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:24.036\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you've gone five columns over-\n&gt;&gt; And then it's telling you,\n\n145\n00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:27.260\none of the things that you did is\nviolating referential integrity.\n\n146\n00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.897\nWell, which one, I changed the address,\nphone number,and the trainer ID.\n\n147\n00:08:30.897 --> 00:08:35.677\nSo you'd have to kind of figure that out,\nall right, so\n\n148\n00:08:35.677 --> 00:08:37.721\nthat's the-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n149\n00:08:37.721 --> 00:08:38.775\n&gt;&gt; What do we call that?\n\n150\n00:08:38.775 --> 00:08:40.354\n&gt;&gt; Referential integrity.\n\n151\n00:08:40.354 --> 00:08:41.485\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you.\n\n152\n00:08:41.485 --> 00:08:42.194\n&gt;&gt; Had to really think\nabout that one too [LAUGH].\n\n153\n00:08:42.194 --> 00:08:46.188\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's our little\nrehash on referential integrity.\n\n154\n00:08:46.188 --> 00:08:50.580\nBut as Vonne was pointing out,\nwhen we look at this relationship again,\n\n155\n00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.130\nthere's two more checkmarks here,\nand let's zoom in.\n\n156\n00:08:54.130 --> 00:09:00.910\nYou see cascade update related fields, and\ncascade delete related records, all right.\n\n157\n00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:05.180\nThese are only available if you've\nturned on referential integrity.\n\n158\n00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:10.173\nSo it's a subset of referential integrity,\nit's not something I can do on its own.\n\n159\n00:09:10.173 --> 00:09:15.332\nIt's part of referential integrity, and it\nhelps me maintain referential integrity.\n\n160\n00:09:15.332 --> 00:09:18.790\nLet's talk about the first one,\ncascade update related fields.\n\n161\n00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.232\nSo one of the things that\nreferential integrity says is,\n\n162\n00:09:21.232 --> 00:09:26.210\nI cannot change a primary key\nvalue if matching records exist.\n\n163\n00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.810\nAll right, I'm gonna cancel all of this,\nand I'll zoom back out.\n\n164\n00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.602\nAnd we just saw that I can't change,\n\n165\n00:09:32.602 --> 00:09:38.185\nlet's say our company now wants to use\nemployee IDs that start with an e for\n\n166\n00:09:38.185 --> 00:09:42.617\nemployee, and\nthey want it to be more like e01, e02.\n\n167\n00:09:42.617 --> 00:09:47.899\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\nI'm gonna change James's ID to e 01.\n\n168\n00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.841\nAll right,\nnow click away to complete that, and\n\n169\n00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:54.567\nI can't because of referential integrity.\n\n170\n00:09:54.567 --> 00:09:59.009\nAnd we just saw this a second ago, but\nwhat if I really need this to happen?\n\n171\n00:09:59.009 --> 00:10:02.762\nI want to change this ID and\nI just tell Access or\n\n172\n00:10:02.762 --> 00:10:09.030\nwhatever RDMS you're using to go ahead and\nfix all of the other places.\n\n173\n00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.200\nThat's what cascading update is gonna do.\n\n174\n00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.096\n&gt;&gt; Is it only on that one field or\nis it in the record, like if-\n\n175\n00:10:17.096 --> 00:10:18.943\n&gt;&gt; It's only on the primary key and\n\n176\n00:10:18.943 --> 00:10:23.118\nforeign key, that's the only thing\nthis has to do with, other fields,\n\n177\n00:10:23.118 --> 00:10:24.830\nthis won't work with.\n\n178\n00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:29.678\nBut remember, a foreign key is a copy\nof the primary key that can be\n\n179\n00:10:29.678 --> 00:10:33.041\nlisted many times in another table, right?\n\n180\n00:10:33.041 --> 00:10:38.084\nSo if I change that primary key,\nthe foreign keys won't match anymore,\n\n181\n00:10:38.084 --> 00:10:42.040\nand that's a no-no for\nreferential integrity.\n\n182\n00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.640\nWhat cascading update will do is say,\nall right, I'll let you change it.\n\n183\n00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.080\nAnd what I'll do is I'll just go update\nall the other places that that primary key\n\n184\n00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:49.830\nis referenced.\n\n185\n00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:54.250\nSo instead of preventing you from changing\nit, I'll change it everywhere for you.\n\n186\n00:10:54.250 --> 00:11:00.551\n&gt;&gt; Okay but it won't change\nif I changed James' state or\n\n187\n00:11:00.551 --> 00:11:06.036\nzip code here, if it was, well-\n&gt;&gt; You're gonna figure it out yourself,\n\n188\n00:11:06.036 --> 00:11:06.606\naren't you?\n\n189\n00:11:06.606 --> 00:11:09.090\n&gt;&gt; I think so [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; Because can I change his name?\n\n190\n00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.680\nAbsolutely, pull that up, wait.\n\n191\n00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.750\nIt's not gonna be referenced\nanywhere else, ever.\n\n192\n00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.690\nBecause we went through normalization,\nright?\n\n193\n00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.466\nHis name is only stored in one place for\n\n194\n00:11:19.466 --> 00:11:23.803\nthat very reason, so-\n&gt;&gt; And if we ever, okay,\n\n195\n00:11:23.803 --> 00:11:29.012\njust to let you know,\nwe came back and filmed this episode.\n\n196\n00:11:29.012 --> 00:11:34.593\nSo I've already been through some of the\nepisodes that you're going to be watching.\n\n197\n00:11:34.593 --> 00:11:38.720\nAnd then domain integrity, because we had\nthese cool drop downs and lookups and\n\n198\n00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.030\nall this stuff.\n\n199\n00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.997\nSo that's why I had to be like, wait,\nremember what episode you're in, Vonne,\n\n200\n00:11:42.997 --> 00:11:44.416\nthey don't know about this stuff yet.\n\n201\n00:11:44.416 --> 00:11:48.908\nCuz then I was like, but if you reference\nsomewhere else in some cool way,\n\n202\n00:11:48.908 --> 00:11:51.853\nyou'll see in the lookups,\nthen it would change.\n\n203\n00:11:51.853 --> 00:11:55.134\n&gt;&gt; Because it's not really,\nit's only changing in one place, and\n\n204\n00:11:55.134 --> 00:11:57.593\neverything is looking it\nup from that one place.\n\n205\n00:11:57.593 --> 00:12:02.108\nSo there isn't any cascade to do,\n[INAUDIBLE].\n\n206\n00:12:02.108 --> 00:12:05.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I can't change this but\n\n207\n00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:08.970\nI really want to, so\nlet's see if we can fix that.\n\n208\n00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.530\nNow I'm gnnna go back over\nhere to classes trainers.\n\n209\n00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.922\nAnd I wanna make this\na little bit easier for\n\n210\n00:12:13.922 --> 00:12:17.326\nus to see what it's allowing me to do or\nnot allowing me to do.\n\n211\n00:12:17.326 --> 00:12:21.223\nSo remember, this is actually storing\nthe class ID and the trainer ID.\n\n212\n00:12:21.223 --> 00:12:24.600\nBut I said Access helping us out\nby displaying the friendly names.\n\n213\n00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.540\nI'm actually gonna change that up,\nwe're gonna go into design view.\n\n214\n00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.220\nAnd remember, we hid the trainer ID,\n\n215\n00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:37.545\nif we look down here-\n&gt;&gt; Now this is something that we did in\n\n216\n00:12:37.545 --> 00:12:40.960\nthe domain integrity episodes, didn't we?\n\n217\n00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.600\n&gt;&gt; Did we?\n\n218\n00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.372\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n219\n00:12:42.372 --> 00:12:44.858\n&gt;&gt; We hadn't done lookups in another one.\n\n220\n00:12:44.858 --> 00:12:49.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so just kinda throwing,\nwe're throwing you a little bit of a loop,\n\n221\n00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.850\njust to keep, I'm keeping the integrity of\nthe flow of the show, of the episodes..\n\n222\n00:12:54.850 --> 00:13:00.406\nYes, so we have done some other changes\nto this data and all these tables.\n\n223\n00:13:00.406 --> 00:13:05.030\nAnd what we're doing in the whole\nminiseries we did on domain integrity.\n\n224\n00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:07.870\nSo if you're like, I'm a little confused,\njust double check.\n\n225\n00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:11.195\nWe can reference it now, but just know,\nthis will be explained later.\n\n226\n00:13:11.195 --> 00:13:12.980\nOr go watch those and come back.\n\n227\n00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:18.014\n&gt;&gt; And honestly, what we're doing\nis not really what you're thinking.\n\n228\n00:13:18.014 --> 00:13:19.739\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; I know what you're thinking,\n\n229\n00:13:19.739 --> 00:13:23.320\nyou're thinking about the dropdown\nlist to allow them to pick.\n\n230\n00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.074\nBut, here I'm just talking about\nthe fact that, well, I guess, yeah,\n\n231\n00:13:27.074 --> 00:13:28.361\nwe'll leave it at that.\n\n232\n00:13:28.361 --> 00:13:32.393\nWe'll say, watch those next episodes and\nthen if it doesn't make sense,\n\n233\n00:13:32.393 --> 00:13:35.220\nshoot me an email at vonne@itpro.tv,\nall right?\n\n234\n00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.184\nSo what I'm gonna do is,\nI'm gonna go back over to design view, and\n\n235\n00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:40.530\nI'm gonna unhide that identity column.\n\n236\n00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:45.586\nI'm just going to make that\nabout 0.5 inches wide, and\n\n237\n00:13:45.586 --> 00:13:51.550\nthat brings my total up to about 1.5,\noops, 1.5 inches.\n\n238\n00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.997\nWe'll get out of that, we'll save it,\nand we'll flip back over so\n\n239\n00:13:54.997 --> 00:13:56.390\nit looks more like that.\n\n240\n00:13:56.390 --> 00:14:00.291\nAll right, so\nthat's really what's stored in this table,\n\n241\n00:14:00.291 --> 00:14:04.529\nis that trainer ID, and the trainer-\n&gt;&gt; This is a little trick that we were\n\n242\n00:14:04.529 --> 00:14:08.886\ntalking about this after our episodes\nthat come in the domain integrity.\n\n243\n00:14:08.886 --> 00:14:11.726\nIf we change that, and\nhow we can actually make it display.\n\n244\n00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:16.288\nSo we're doing so much foreshadowing\nright now, it's amazing [LAUGH].\n\n245\n00:14:16.288 --> 00:14:19.820\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwe're gonna be dealing with Mr.\n\n246\n00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.569\nJames Butt, and he is trainer ID 1.\n\n247\n00:14:22.569 --> 00:14:27.730\nAnd we can see that he is referenced\nin this table at least twice,\n\n248\n00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:33.620\nright, which is why it won't let\nme delete this record, right.\n\n249\n00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.690\nBecause he's got records\nreferencing this record, and\n\n250\n00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:42.108\nI can't change this because of\nthat referential integrity.\n\n251\n00:14:42.108 --> 00:14:46.725\nAnd there's records that reference back\nto this, right, so we figured that out.\n\n252\n00:14:46.725 --> 00:14:51.739\nSo if I want to, what we can do is,\nwe can go to relationships and\n\n253\n00:14:51.739 --> 00:14:55.727\nwe can go to the properties\nof that relationship.\n\n254\n00:14:55.727 --> 00:15:02.198\nAnd I can enable cascade update\nrelated fields, and I'll click OK.\n\n255\n00:15:02.198 --> 00:15:05.015\nAnd it's gonna say, no,\nthe tables are open, you can't do that.\n\n256\n00:15:05.015 --> 00:15:09.782\nAnd I'm gonna say, okay Access,\nlet me go close the tables, and\n\n257\n00:15:09.782 --> 00:15:11.700\nthen you'll let me do it.\n\n258\n00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.910\nAll right, so now one more time,\nwe'll go into here,\n\n259\n00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:20.430\nwe're gonna turn on cascade update\nrelated fields, we're gonna click OK.\n\n260\n00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:26.142\nNow I'm gonna open up classes trainers,\nand I can see there's James' ID as a 1.\n\n261\n00:15:26.142 --> 00:15:31.974\nWe're gonna open up trainers, and\nI'm going to change his employee ID,\n\n262\n00:15:31.974 --> 00:15:35.183\nwhich is the primary key for this table.\n\n263\n00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.880\nI'll click away, and\nnotice it lets me this time.\n\n264\n00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.050\nIf we go check out the classes trainers,\nlook at there.\n\n265\n00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:44.670\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n266\n00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.991\n&gt;&gt; It updated to e01.\n\n267\n00:15:46.991 --> 00:15:51.715\n&gt;&gt; This might be a small thing, but\nthat particular field in trainers,\n\n268\n00:15:51.715 --> 00:15:55.552\nthat was an auto-generated\nnumber like the data type?\n\n269\n00:15:55.552 --> 00:15:58.361\n&gt;&gt; Nope, but that is a great question.\n\n270\n00:15:58.361 --> 00:15:59.232\n&gt;&gt; You know what I'm trying to say?\n\n271\n00:15:59.232 --> 00:16:05.099\n&gt;&gt; Yes, if it was an autogenerated\nID I couldn't change it anyway.\n\n272\n00:16:05.099 --> 00:16:09.160\nIt's not going to let me change it\nbecause it's an access generated number.\n\n273\n00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.030\n&gt;&gt; We typed that in.\n\n274\n00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.590\nIt's a short text.\n\n275\n00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:11.900\n&gt;&gt; We, remember when we, yeah.\n\n276\n00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.670\nSo you have to go back a few episodes, but\nwhen we designed this table, we set that\n\n277\n00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:19.990\nup as short text, to show them they\ndidn't have to use an automated number.\n\n278\n00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:21.310\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; You could use your own numbering\n\n279\n00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:25.680\nsystem like E01, or E-005, or\nwhatever you wanted to do.\n\n280\n00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.180\n&gt;&gt; And I think that's why I'm\nblending some of the tables.\n\n281\n00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because I know we did\n\n282\n00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.120\ndo some auto numbering as far--\n&gt;&gt; Every one of the other ones is,\n\n283\n00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:33.970\njust this one.\n\n284\n00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:34.570\n&gt;&gt; All right, good.\n[LAUGH]\n\n285\n00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.330\n&gt;&gt; And we did that intentionally so\n\n286\n00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.335\nwe could come back\naround to show you this.\n\n287\n00:16:38.335 --> 00:16:39.460\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n288\n00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.911\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nthat is cascade auto update, or cascade,\n\n289\n00:16:43.911 --> 00:16:47.870\nI cannot talk, cascade updates, all right?\n\n290\n00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:52.880\nIf you update the primary key,\nit will automatically update every place\n\n291\n00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.630\nin the rest of the database that that\nprimary key is used, as a foreign key.\n\n292\n00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:01.910\nAgain, this only has to do with\nprimary keys and their references,\n\n293\n00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:02.620\nthe foreign keys.\n\n294\n00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:05.200\nThis isn't other fields or\nanything like that.\n\n295\n00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.900\nThey should only be stored\nonce in your database, so\n\n296\n00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.780\nyou shouldn't have to worry\nabout doing cascade updates.\n\n297\n00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.860\nRight, so that's the way that works.\n\n298\n00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:16.390\nAnd I tell ya, it's something that you've\ngot to think of as an organization, right?\n\n299\n00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.440\nDo you want to allow this,\ndoes it work with this data,\n\n300\n00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:24.930\nshould I allow those changes,\nbecause now I've lost all reference.\n\n301\n00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:28.810\nLet's say his I.D used to be E-005, and\n\n302\n00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:33.070\nI changed it to E-001,\n\n303\n00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:37.780\nI haven't really lost all those,\nbut I could lose history somewhere.\n\n304\n00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.300\n&gt;&gt; Well I'm thinking like\nin work track changes.\n\n305\n00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Like you can't just turn track changes,\n\n306\n00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:44.370\nI mean do they have like log references or\nwhatever?\n\n307\n00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:47.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you'd have to set up a table to\nwhere anything, if something was modified,\n\n308\n00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:52.160\nyou take the original first, put it in\nanother table and then let it be modified.\n\n309\n00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.760\n&gt;&gt; It's obviously--\n&gt;&gt; Modified, it'll--\n\n310\n00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.390\n&gt;&gt; That's a little bit more advanced.\n\n311\n00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:56.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But it is possible.\n\n312\n00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.780\n&gt;&gt; It is possible.\n\n313\n00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.560\nYep.\n&gt;&gt; But in this\n\n314\n00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.660\nscenario that we're talking about\nit's like, yeah, you've changed it.\n\n315\n00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:05.480\nTomorrow you come back, I don't\nremember what his old employee ID was.\n\n316\n00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.470\nAnd if I didn't notate that anywhere else,\nthen, yes.\n\n317\n00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:12.110\n&gt;&gt; It could be an issue, exactly.\n\n318\n00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:14.180\nSo that's the cascading updates.\n\n319\n00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:18.610\nNow if we go back and\nlook at that relationship property again,\n\n320\n00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.800\nso there's also an option for\ncascaded delete.\n\n321\n00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.810\nAnd I'm going to tell you, I'm\na proponent of cascading updates, right?\n\n322\n00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:29.530\nI like that, most of the time it's\nnot going to get you in trouble\n\n323\n00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:31.290\nbecause like I said we really don't lose,\n\n324\n00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:35.340\nI didn't lose the fact that he is\nset up to teach these classes.\n\n325\n00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:39.821\nIt changed his employee ID number and I\ndon't know what his trainer ID is anymore,\n\n326\n00:18:39.821 --> 00:18:43.340\nthe old one was, but\nmaybe I don't really care and\n\n327\n00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.690\nagain I don't really lose anything.\n\n328\n00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:51.110\nBut this one,\ncascade delete related records,\n\n329\n00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.870\nyou can probably infer\nwhat that's going to do.\n\n330\n00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:58.420\nI cannot delete a record if the primary\nkey is being referenced as a foreign key\n\n331\n00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.410\nin any other table.\n\n332\n00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.820\nIn other words, what's his name,\nJames, I think?\n\n333\n00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.620\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n334\n00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:05.030\n&gt;&gt; Has been inserted into\n\n335\n00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.960\nthe classes trainers calendar,\nso I can't delete\n\n336\n00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:12.070\nhis record because his record is being\nreferenced by that classes trainers table.\n\n337\n00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.040\nCascade delete, if I enable this,\n\n338\n00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.600\nwill say all right, instead of\npreventing you from deleting it,\n\n339\n00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.312\nbecause it will leave orphaned records,\nwhat I'll do is I'll delete the one you\n\n340\n00:19:21.312 --> 00:19:25.370\nwant to delete, and I'll delete any\nrecord that has a reference back to it.\n\n341\n00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:27.900\nNow you don't have any orphaned records.\n\n342\n00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.550\nBut you also just deleted\na lot of information, right?\n\n343\n00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I totally see what you're saying,\n\n344\n00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:38.140\nand I guess there's, I'm always\nthinking I can think on the flip\n\n345\n00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.940\nside of why there might be reasons\nwhy you would want that to happen.\n\n346\n00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:46.620\nIf this is like your active,\nmaybe somehow there's,\n\n347\n00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.360\nI'm thinking like college classes or\nwhatever?\n\n348\n00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.010\nLike this is what the students see.\n\n349\n00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:50.790\nThis is what we see.\n\n350\n00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:55.405\nWell, if we cancel the class, if we delete\nit here, it better be deleted here.\n\n351\n00:19:55.405 --> 00:19:59.800\nBecause we don't want the students\nseeing a class that we are not running.\n\n352\n00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.260\nSo there's situations where\nyou'd want it that way too.\n\n353\n00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.430\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, yeah.\n\n354\n00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.870\nAnd so there's [LAUGH].\n\n355\n00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.980\n&gt;&gt; We're just having all sorts\nof fun with words, right?\n\n356\n00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:12.730\n&gt;&gt; I tell you what.\n\n357\n00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:14.310\nEnglish is my first language too.\n\n358\n00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:16.900\nIt is my only language,\nI don't even do it well.\n\n359\n00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.690\nBut yes, exactly right.\n\n360\n00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:24.230\nSo there are gonna be some times when\nwe might want to use cascading delete.\n\n361\n00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:28.335\nJust keep that in mind that\nyou can end up losing data,\n\n362\n00:20:28.335 --> 00:20:30.440\nbecause if this is a customer's database,\n\n363\n00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:35.170\nall right, or an orders database for\na sales company and I've got customers and\n\n364\n00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.630\nI've got a table with all\nthe orders they've placed with us.\n\n365\n00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:40.820\nWell, let's say business\nXYZ is out of business.\n\n366\n00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.970\nThey've closed their doors, so\n\n367\n00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:46.170\nwe're not going to be able to sell to\nthem anymore, I want to remove them from\n\n368\n00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:50.950\nthe customer's table because I don't want\nany of my sales people calling on them,\n\n369\n00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:54.380\nbecause they're not in business anymore,\nso I want to delete their record.\n\n370\n00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.610\nSo I can't delete it because\nthere's records referencing it, so\n\n371\n00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:00.540\nI turn on cascade delete,\nnow I delete it, and\n\n372\n00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.310\nit deletes the history of all those\norders that they've placed with us.\n\n373\n00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.730\nAnd those are gone forever, right?\n\n374\n00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:09.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think with both of these,\nthe update and the delete, it's great\n\n375\n00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:15.640\nwhen you need it, but\nit has a potential to really mess you up.\n\n376\n00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.560\nThis can be very dangerous.\n\n377\n00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:21.570\n&gt;&gt; It can be.\n&gt;&gt; Depending on what is important\n\n378\n00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:23.330\nof how you're storing your data.\n\n379\n00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:26.530\nSo it can go both ways on this one.\n\n380\n00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.900\n&gt;&gt; And it is something that you can turn\non, use, and then turn back off, too.\n\n381\n00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:32.660\nLike referential integrity\nI will leave on.\n\n382\n00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:38.030\nThat stays on to make sure I maintain the\nfact that the primary key has to exist,\n\n383\n00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.700\nand things like that.\n\n384\n00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.570\nBut the cascading updating tasks and\ncascading deletes,\n\n385\n00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:45.270\nI might turn it on just to do one\nthing and then turn it back off so\n\n386\n00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:49.620\nnobody else accidentally updates a record\nand updates all these other records.\n\n387\n00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:53.980\nYou can set it up so that you can trigger\ncascading across multiple tables.\n\n388\n00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.800\nYou make one change, and\nthat triggers a change on another table,\n\n389\n00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.920\nwhich triggers a change on another table,\nwhich triggers a change on another table,\n\n390\n00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.220\nand it's great if that's\nwhat you needed to do.\n\n391\n00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.440\nIt's really scary if you didn't\nknow that was set up to do that.\n\n392\n00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:13.130\n&gt;&gt; And I've been in situations where it's\none of those, I can do certain things.\n\n393\n00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:17.670\nBut if I really wanted\nsomething to not exist anymore,\n\n394\n00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:22.370\nreferring back to when I worked at the\nuniversity, I had to call tech support and\n\n395\n00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:25.190\nI had to call somebody had\nto like sign off on it.\n\n396\n00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:29.030\nAnd then it was only if I\ncalled this one department and\n\n397\n00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:33.870\nthe one person that had the power to\ndo it did it, it was really gone.\n\n398\n00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:38.340\nThat and it like completely\nexisted across all these\n\n399\n00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:42.820\ndifferent places, but I couldn't do it.\n\n400\n00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.080\nNo, you had to have the master key.\n\n401\n00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.130\n&gt;&gt; He probably turned it on just for\nhim to do it, then turned it back off.\n\n402\n00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:48.660\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n403\n00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.180\nYeah, I'm like yeah,\nI can see him checking the box off.\n\n404\n00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.100\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's test it out.\n\n405\n00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:58.760\nLet's go in here and we've already seen\nI think that in the classes trainers.\n\n406\n00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:03.560\nIt did update right if we\ngo back to trainers and\n\n407\n00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.380\nI try to delete James,\n\n408\n00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:12.100\nit says no because there\nare related records.\n\n409\n00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.950\nSo we're going to turn on which means I\nknow I'm going to have to close all my\n\n410\n00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:16.260\ntables access.\n\n411\n00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.260\nWe're going to come back in here and\n\n412\n00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:23.170\nmodify the properties by choosing cascade\ndelete related records, I'll click okay,\n\n413\n00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:27.520\nwe're going to open up trainers and\nclasses trainers one more time.\n\n414\n00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:32.025\nSo again there is two records\nthat are referencing the James,\n\n415\n00:23:32.025 --> 00:23:34.730\nbut I'm going to delete him again.\n\n416\n00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:40.700\nIt's going warn me, I get one warning,\nrelated records exist in the classes.\n\n417\n00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.522\nReference and\nintegrity rules would be violated.\n\n418\n00:23:43.522 --> 00:23:44.588\nWait, did I turn it on?\n\n419\n00:23:47.165 --> 00:23:48.170\nLet me check that again.\n\n420\n00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.174\nLet's go back in there.\n\n421\n00:23:50.605 --> 00:23:53.945\nCascade delete related records and\nwe'll click okay.\n\n422\n00:23:53.945 --> 00:23:56.634\nAnd we're going to go back to Trainers.\n\n423\n00:23:56.634 --> 00:23:58.483\n&gt;&gt; Is it the other way around?\n\n424\n00:23:58.483 --> 00:24:03.009\nI mean because of the, I don't know if the\nrelationships are different, like if you\n\n425\n00:24:03.009 --> 00:24:07.129\nDeleted it in the classes trainers,\nand it would delete from trainers?\n\n426\n00:24:07.129 --> 00:24:08.610\n&gt;&gt; No, I'm not reading my warning.\n\n427\n00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:13.020\nSays related records exit in\nthe table scheduled classes.\n\n428\n00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:16.680\nSo not only are the related\nrecords in classes trainers,\n\n429\n00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.587\nI've also scheduled some classes, right?\n\n430\n00:24:19.587 --> 00:24:24.021\nSo here's,\nit's actually a really good example,\n\n431\n00:24:24.021 --> 00:24:28.957\nis his primary key, the trainer ID,\nis referenced here,\n\n432\n00:24:28.957 --> 00:24:33.480\nbut it's also potentially referenced-\n&gt;&gt; Over there.\n\n433\n00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.170\n&gt;&gt; Where?\n\n434\n00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:40.550\n&gt;&gt; Well, because the trainer ID, it-\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna delete records that-\n\n435\n00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:41.697\n&gt;&gt; It's yeah, that,\n\n436\n00:24:41.697 --> 00:24:43.250\nsomething in there [LAUGH].\n\n437\n00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:48.440\n&gt;&gt; So now all of a sudden,\nI would have to actually turn\n\n438\n00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:54.613\non cascade deletes here as well because,\nand it's locked.\n\n439\n00:24:54.613 --> 00:24:59.871\n&gt;&gt; But this really shows, like you said,\nthe cascading effect that\n\n440\n00:24:59.871 --> 00:25:05.340\nhappens when you have all of\nthese intertwined relationships.\n\n441\n00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:09.820\nIt's not just between here and here,\nit's also this one and this one.\n\n442\n00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.435\nAnd how they kind of interweave together,\nand\n\n443\n00:25:12.435 --> 00:25:14.790\nthat's why I think it's barking at you.\n\n444\n00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:18.479\n&gt;&gt; If you look at it,\nso what it's saying is,\n\n445\n00:25:18.479 --> 00:25:22.885\nI can't delete it because\nif I delete this, well,\n\n446\n00:25:22.885 --> 00:25:28.320\nthis has an ID of 4,\nwhich is in my scheduled classes, right?\n\n447\n00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.550\nWhich one is it, I don't know which one,\nPuppy Kindergarten.\n\n448\n00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:36.700\nSo one of those records in\nhere is referencing that.\n\n449\n00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:43.030\nThat's Veraska,\nwhere is the other Puppy Kindergarten?\n\n450\n00:25:44.281 --> 00:25:45.947\nIt's related.\n\n451\n00:25:45.947 --> 00:25:48.859\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, of course now, I can't find it,\n\n452\n00:25:48.859 --> 00:25:53.494\nPuppy Kindergarten, so let's go\nback over here, Puppy Kindergarten,\n\n453\n00:25:53.494 --> 00:25:55.600\nam I missing it, I don't see it.\n\n454\n00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:00.834\nWell, we're gonna find out,\nlet's go ahead and do this,\n\n455\n00:26:00.834 --> 00:26:03.230\nlet's close these three tables.\n\n456\n00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:05.792\nLet's turn on my cascading deletes here,\n\n457\n00:26:05.792 --> 00:26:08.490\nI didn't have referential\nintegrity turned on.\n\n458\n00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:13.550\n&gt;&gt; There's no relation, I think you\nclicked in the wrong place, there you go.\n\n459\n00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:14.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n460\n00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:15.619\n&gt;&gt; I will say OK to that,\n\n461\n00:26:15.619 --> 00:26:17.710\nnow we'll try this one more time.\n\n462\n00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:21.165\nWe'll open trainers,\nwe'll open up classes trainers.\n\n463\n00:26:21.165 --> 00:26:24.236\nGo back to trainers,\nand we're gonna delete.\n\n464\n00:26:24.236 --> 00:26:27.700\nIt says I'm about to delete one record,\nare you sure?\n\n465\n00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:32.292\nAnd now it's gone, but if I go look\nat classes trainers, look at that.\n\n466\n00:26:32.292 --> 00:26:35.022\nSo I deleted it and\nthe other information, and\n\n467\n00:26:35.022 --> 00:26:39.020\nthen this ID it was tying back\nto the scheduled classes.\n\n468\n00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.380\nWhich means I should see some\nrecords missing from here as well.\n\n469\n00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.580\nCan't tell which ones, but\nthere are fewer records in here, so.\n\n470\n00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:52.010\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's kinda scary looking, if\nyou open that up, it's like uh-oh, that.\n\n471\n00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:55.920\nCuz this is one,\nit has to be connected, and\n\n472\n00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.410\nyou can't kinda take this one piece out.\n\n473\n00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:03.070\nSo this would be a scenario where\nthis would probably be bad [LAUGH].\n\n474\n00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:09.570\n&gt;&gt; I don't see too many scenarios\nwhere cascaded delete makes sense.\n\n475\n00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:15.520\nI'm sure there are, but typically I want\na little more control over that process.\n\n476\n00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.744\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the example I gave of\nthe classes, well, you'd probably,\n\n477\n00:27:18.744 --> 00:27:21.810\nthey would be seeing this table,\nthe one that you're editing.\n\n478\n00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.278\nThere wouldn't be a duplicate copy or\nanything.\n\n479\n00:27:24.278 --> 00:27:27.430\nBut like you said,\nthere's always reasons for everything,\n\n480\n00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:29.737\notherwise they wouldn't give us\na choice to turn it on or turn it off.\n\n481\n00:27:29.737 --> 00:27:31.685\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Nice, well,\n\n482\n00:27:31.685 --> 00:27:33.810\nthat does make sense.\n\n483\n00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:37.229\nAnd I can see we talked\nabout this potential.\n\n484\n00:27:37.229 --> 00:27:40.840\nUnderstand the concept,\nI'm understanding it pretty well.\n\n485\n00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.211\nAnd hopefully you guys\nare understanding it.\n\n486\n00:27:42.211 --> 00:27:45.095\nAnd then you get to choose whether or\nnot you're gonna do it.\n\n487\n00:27:45.095 --> 00:27:48.242\n[LAUGH] Awesome, well, thank you so\nmuch Mike for stopping by again.\n\n488\n00:27:48.242 --> 00:27:51.938\nAnd thank you guys for stopping by,\nbut we have a lot more,\n\n489\n00:27:51.938 --> 00:27:56.725\nso check out those next episodes on\ndomain integrity, we have a lot of fun.\n\n490\n00:27:56.725 --> 00:28:00.495\n[LAUGH] All right, signing off for\nOfficeProTV, I'm your host, Vonne Smith.\n\n491\n00:28:00.495 --> 00:28:01.720\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n492\n00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.189\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see

[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And here to put up\n\n7\n00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.008\nthe streamers [LAUGH] is Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:32.961\nHi, how you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:36.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The one that just keeps going,\nand going, and going, and won't shut up,\n\n10\n00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.427\nwhen it comes to domain integrity.\n\n11\n00:00:37.427 --> 00:00:39.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, I thought it was amazing.\n\n12\n00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.186\nI really liked, I mean, we really went\noff-script the other day [LAUGH].\n\n13\n00:00:43.186 --> 00:00:47.319\nAnd got into this maybe a little bit\nof scary territory, but it was so cool.\n\n14\n00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:51.087\nLike I, I mean it was a personal\nachievement for me of, like,\n\n15\n00:00:51.087 --> 00:00:52.355\nI understood this.\n\n16\n00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:53.039\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Good,\n\n17\n00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.259\nit fixed the problem,\nyou learned a lot, right?\n\n18\n00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.833\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I really did.\n\n19\n00:00:57.833 --> 00:00:59.300\n&gt;&gt; It is fun.\n\n20\n00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.391\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm excited to see what\nyou wanted to throw out here.\n\n21\n00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:03.692\nI know you did allude to it.\n\n22\n00:01:03.692 --> 00:01:07.493\n&gt;&gt; I did, I think when we first started\ntalking about domain integrity and\n\n23\n00:01:07.493 --> 00:01:09.090\nwe were defining what it was.\n\n24\n00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.693\nI had mentioned things like unique\nconstraints and required constraints, and\n\n25\n00:01:13.693 --> 00:01:14.870\nsome other things.\n\n26\n00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.870\nAnd I don't think we ever went and really\nfully looked at those two constraints.\n\n27\n00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.355\nSo I did wanna go back and\nmake sure we hit those.\n\n28\n00:01:21.355 --> 00:01:24.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, cuz you said it,\nand I'm like yeah.\n\n29\n00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.372\nCuz we were talking about it after\nthe episode yesterday, and we were like,\n\n30\n00:01:27.372 --> 00:01:28.798\nno We need to come back and do some more.\n\n31\n00:01:28.798 --> 00:01:29.346\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n32\n00:01:29.346 --> 00:01:29.950\n&gt;&gt; So that's why we're here.\n\n33\n00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.580\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So here we are, we're doing more.\n\n34\n00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.844\nAll right, so let's define them real\nquick, and then we'll do some practical.\n\n35\n00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:38.624\nOr we'll take a look at how we do it\nin this particular RDMS that I'm using,\n\n36\n00:01:38.624 --> 00:01:39.586\nAccess 2016.\n\n37\n00:01:39.586 --> 00:01:41.588\nI think I'm in 2016, yeah.\n\n38\n00:01:41.588 --> 00:01:44.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just double checking my version.\n\n39\n00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.726\nYou know Microsoft\nchanges every other day.\n\n40\n00:01:45.726 --> 00:01:49.680\nSo we wanna talk again about unique and\nrequired.\n\n41\n00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.654\nAnd their names pretty much tell\nyou everything you need to know.\n\n42\n00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:56.580\nYou just need to figure our how to\nimplement it in your particular RDMS.\n\n43\n00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.251\nAnd understand what it is,\n\n44\n00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:02.330\nwhat it's doing behind the scenes,\nI guess is a good way to say it.\n\n45\n00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.005\nSo when you're talking about\nthe unique constraint,\n\n46\n00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:08.760\nfrom the name you can probably infer,\nwhat does that mean, Vonne?\n\n47\n00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.357\n&gt;&gt; Unique means unique.\n\n48\n00:02:10.357 --> 00:02:11.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n49\n00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.101\n&gt;&gt; I love defining my terms,\nwith the term [LAUGH].\n\n50\n00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:16.270\n&gt;&gt; I know, that helps us a lot.\n\n51\n00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.582\n&gt;&gt; I do it all the time too.\n\n52\n00:02:17.582 --> 00:02:20.023\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, let's have it if we change it up\n\n53\n00:02:20.023 --> 00:02:23.144\nand say unique would mean no duplicate,\nright?\n\n54\n00:02:23.144 --> 00:02:25.740\nNo two items can be the same.\n\n55\n00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.580\nIt would make something unique.\n\n56\n00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.020\nAnd that's what we're doing here.\n\n57\n00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.124\nWe already understand that a primary key,\n\n58\n00:02:31.124 --> 00:02:33.469\nwe have to assign to get\ninto first normal form.\n\n59\n00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.485\nAnd that uniquely identifies each top or\n\n60\n00:02:36.485 --> 00:02:40.126\neach row within that relation or\ntable, right?\n\n61\n00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:41.675\nWe understand that, but\n\n62\n00:02:41.675 --> 00:02:45.820\nwhat we might not realize is that\nunique property of a primary key.\n\n63\n00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.310\nA primary key says this field has to be\nunique, and it cannot be null, right?\n\n64\n00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.590\nIt has to be filled in, that way we\ncan uniquely identify every row.\n\n65\n00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.990\nSo if we take that primary key,\nand start dissecting it up,\n\n66\n00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.920\none part of primary key is\nthat unique constraint.\n\n67\n00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.110\nAnd I can take that unique constraint and\napply it to other columns.\n\n68\n00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.560\nNot necessarily make them a primary key,\nbut\n\n69\n00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.927\nI might have other columns that\nI need to make sure are unique.\n\n70\n00:03:10.927 --> 00:03:14.051\nLike, any examples you can think\nof off the top of your head?\n\n71\n00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:16.580\n&gt;&gt; The Social Security.\n\n72\n00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.964\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?\n&gt;&gt; Which we don't want to be\n\n73\n00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:19.760\nas a primary key,cuz security.\n\n74\n00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.929\nI know it gets weird with\nyour security thing, but\n\n75\n00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:26.330\nno body should have the same\nSocial Security Number.\n\n76\n00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.521\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, you know, and here in the US,\n\n77\n00:03:28.521 --> 00:03:31.750\nthe Social Security Number is\nused to pay into that system.\n\n78\n00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.695\nAnd maybe get some money\nback when you retire.\n\n79\n00:03:33.695 --> 00:03:38.391\nIt's like a Tax Payer Identification\nNumber would be another one that has to be\n\n80\n00:03:38.391 --> 00:03:39.310\nunique.\n\n81\n00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.759\nOther countries are gonna have\nsomething similar most likely.\n\n82\n00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:44.960\nIt's that unique identifier for\nus, as people.\n\n83\n00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.114\nAnd so, if I had that as\na column in my employees table,\n\n84\n00:03:48.114 --> 00:03:50.391\nI don't wanna make it the primary key.\n\n85\n00:03:50.391 --> 00:03:55.730\nThe employee ID's already a perfectly\nfine, short, unique value for that.\n\n86\n00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.542\nBut I do wanna make sure nobody mistakenly\nenters a duplicate Social Security Number.\n\n87\n00:03:59.542 --> 00:04:02.928\nYou know, transposes some numbers and\nends up making duplicate or\n\n88\n00:04:02.928 --> 00:04:04.150\nsomething like that.\n\n89\n00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.175\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it, and that was why I'm like,\nwait, this is a primary key.\n\n90\n00:04:07.175 --> 00:04:13.457\nBut no, it's not a primary key, it's any\nfield can be unique and/or required.\n\n91\n00:04:13.457 --> 00:04:17.620\nJust primary keys are already doing that.\n\n92\n00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.681\nAnd primary keys are more\nthe relationships between tables.\n\n93\n00:04:21.681 --> 00:04:27.290\nSo, that's really why we need primary\nkeys and all that kinda stuff.\n\n94\n00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.708\n&gt;&gt; And so really, a primary key is\njust a unique index that we've said.\n\n95\n00:04:32.708 --> 00:04:36.090\nOr I say, a unique constraint\nthat we're calling a special one,\n\n96\n00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.517\nthat you can't get rid of.\n\n97\n00:04:37.517 --> 00:04:40.700\nI can have more than one, but\nI've gotta have one unique constraint.\n\n98\n00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.198\nAnd we're gonna call that the primary key,\nright?\n\n99\n00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:45.480\nThat is the primary\nuniqueness of this table.\n\n100\n00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.840\nThere can be other unique factors\nthat make each row unique.\n\n101\n00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.770\nBut the primary unique\nfactor is that primary key.\n\n102\n00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.365\nSo, hopefully that makes sense.\n\n103\n00:04:54.365 --> 00:04:57.310\nAnd so let's do an example real quick and\naccess.\n\n104\n00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.744\nYou would simply go to your table and\ngo to your design view.\n\n105\n00:05:00.744 --> 00:05:03.920\nAnd we're gonna do email address for\nthis one.\n\n106\n00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.900\nYvonne, you and I will have a little\nconversation about email address.\n\n107\n00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.540\nI thought the email address would be\na great one to use for uniqueness.\n\n108\n00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.823\nBecause I wanna make sure that somebody\ndoesn't try to use somebody else's email\n\n109\n00:05:14.823 --> 00:05:17.452\nor, you know, I don't want to\nduplicate emails inner in there.\n\n110\n00:05:17.452 --> 00:05:21.870\nI wanna make sure each customer has their\nown unique reachable Email address.\n\n111\n00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:22.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I was like yeah.\n\n112\n00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.355\nBut what if somebody uses like,\nmaybe a husband and\n\n113\n00:05:26.355 --> 00:05:28.633\nwife have the same email address.\n\n114\n00:05:28.633 --> 00:05:31.285\nAnd then we got an hole or\nsomething on top I was like, no.\n\n115\n00:05:31.285 --> 00:05:34.353\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was shocked when you said that.\n\n116\n00:05:34.353 --> 00:05:35.739\n[LAUGH] I think like, what?\n\n117\n00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:37.180\nDoes this happen?\n\n118\n00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.906\nDo people out there actually share\nemails between spouses, stuff like that?\n\n119\n00:05:41.906 --> 00:05:46.018\nThat sounds like a set up for\ndisaster to me.\n\n120\n00:05:46.018 --> 00:05:49.204\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was like, I would never do that, but\n\n121\n00:05:49.204 --> 00:05:52.830\nI mean, to each his own, that kinda thing.\n\n122\n00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.330\nWe just got into a fun little debate\nabout that, but it does kinda go back to.\n\n123\n00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.280\nYou really do need to evaluate\nwithin your own company.\n\n124\n00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.621\nWould this ever be a scenario\nwhere it could be duplicate, or\n\n125\n00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:09.950\nhave the same email address,\nbut, you know.\n\n126\n00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.608\n&gt;&gt; Let's twist it around just a hair and\n\n127\n00:06:11.608 --> 00:06:13.810\nput it back into another\nreal-world scenario.\n\n128\n00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.550\nLet's say this is your employees table,\nand this is work email address.\n\n129\n00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.733\nSo, everybody's work email\naddress ends in @ITPro.TV.\n\n130\n00:06:23.733 --> 00:06:26.820\nI'm Mike@ITPro.TV.\n\n131\n00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.660\nWe hire another Mike, and\nsomebody tries to enter in a new record.\n\n132\n00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.147\nAnd they go to put Mike@ITPro.TV,\nI don't want that.\n\n133\n00:06:34.147 --> 00:06:37.507\nThere needs to be a Mike 2 or\na Mike R or the other Mike, or\n\n134\n00:06:37.507 --> 00:06:40.305\nthe Mike that's not as good,\nwhatever it is.\n\n135\n00:06:40.305 --> 00:06:41.605\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The other Mike.\n\n136\n00:06:41.605 --> 00:06:43.559\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIt needs to be unique,\n\n137\n00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:47.800\nso I can put a unique\nconstraint on that field.\n\n138\n00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.541\nEnsuring that nobody duplicates\nany of those email addresses.\n\n139\n00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:52.068\n&gt;&gt; That's an awesome example.\n\n140\n00:06:52.068 --> 00:06:54.558\nI mean, that right there,\nfor an email address.\n\n141\n00:06:54.558 --> 00:06:56.492\nAnd you wouldn't,\nthat's not a primary key,\n\n142\n00:06:56.492 --> 00:06:58.728\ncuz the employee ID would\nprobably be the primary key.\n\n143\n00:06:58.728 --> 00:07:05.110\nBut, yeah, It has to be unique, and\nI know there are two separate things.\n\n144\n00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.354\nBut you could also make it required.\n\n145\n00:07:06.354 --> 00:07:10.190\nBut again, we're talking about\nunique by itself right, okay.\n\n146\n00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.120\n&gt;&gt; So let's go in and\nlet's take a look at how that works.\n\n147\n00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.960\nI've got my table open here,\nwe've got our emails.\n\n148\n00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.628\nI'm gonna go into design view.\n\n149\n00:07:17.628 --> 00:07:20.480\nAnd again, each chart you amass is gonna\nimplement this a little bit differently.\n\n150\n00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.133\nWe're gonna go up and\nselect my email field.\n\n151\n00:07:24.133 --> 00:07:29.090\nAnd then down here at the bottom,\nI've got my indexed option.\n\n152\n00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.290\nAnd nothing in here says unique,\nthat's just Access.\n\n153\n00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:36.490\nWhere they hide it is under\nthis indexed attribute.\n\n154\n00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.327\nSo, I'm gonna zoom out so\nI can see my drop down list for this one.\n\n155\n00:07:39.327 --> 00:07:43.571\nI'm gonna hit this, and now I'll show you\nthe choices we have are gonna be either.\n\n156\n00:07:43.571 --> 00:07:48.816\nYes create an index, No Duplicates,\nor Yes (Duplicates OK).\n\n157\n00:07:48.816 --> 00:07:51.281\nSo if I choose Yes, (No Duplicates),\n\n158\n00:07:51.281 --> 00:07:56.514\nI'm saying place a unique constraint on\nthis column.d Do not allow any duplicates.\n\n159\n00:07:56.514 --> 00:08:00.745\n&gt;&gt; I remember at this point, when we were\nlooking at primary keys, and you see, and\n\n160\n00:08:00.745 --> 00:08:04.294\nyou actually pointed this out So\nnow we're right back around here,\n\n161\n00:08:04.294 --> 00:08:06.365\njust not with the primary key anymore.\n\n162\n00:08:06.365 --> 00:08:07.448\nJust any field.\n&gt;&gt; In fact let's look,\n\n163\n00:08:07.448 --> 00:08:08.824\nhere's the owner ID, right?\n\n164\n00:08:08.824 --> 00:08:12.100\nThat is my primary key,\nand look what it says.\n\n165\n00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.560\nYes, no duplicates.\n\n166\n00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.020\nSo that single factor,\nthe unique constraint,\n\n167\n00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.910\nis exactly the same on the primary key as\nit is in this column we just did, right?\n\n168\n00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.814\nSo it's hard to sometimes put into words,\nbut\n\n169\n00:08:23.814 --> 00:08:26.652\ndon't think that unique means primary key.\n\n170\n00:08:26.652 --> 00:08:28.619\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Primary key is unique, but\n\n171\n00:08:28.619 --> 00:08:31.913\nI can put the unique constraint\non other columns if I need to,\n\n172\n00:08:31.913 --> 00:08:33.474\nthat aren't primary keys.\n\n173\n00:08:33.474 --> 00:08:35.498\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and at first,\nit took me a while to separate those two.\n\n174\n00:08:35.498 --> 00:08:37.376\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And now I'm like, well yeah, okay,\n\n175\n00:08:37.376 --> 00:08:39.415\nnow that makes sense,\nthat they're separate.\n\n176\n00:08:39.415 --> 00:08:44.431\nAnd since we said Indexed,\nyes, no duplicates.\n\n177\n00:08:44.431 --> 00:08:49.401\nIf somebody tried to put in Mike@ITProTV,\nthen it would give them a warning, or\n\n178\n00:08:49.401 --> 00:08:54.680\nthere would be something that says, nope,\nhey, you have to have a unique name.\n\n179\n00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.660\n&gt;&gt; Let's try that, all right?\n\n180\n00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.318\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna save this and\n\n181\n00:08:57.318 --> 00:09:01.920\nwe're gonna flip over to Data Sheet View,\nand we're going to go over here.\n\n182\n00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.770\nAnd I'm gonna put in a new email address,\nlet's do this properly.\n\n183\n00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:12.568\nWe'll say Mike Rodrick, 123 Some ST.\n\n184\n00:09:12.568 --> 00:09:14.540\nOops, you know I can't leave that.\n\n185\n00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.291\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Gaines,\n\n186\n00:09:17.291 --> 00:09:21.696\nI should just make something up, ville.\n\n187\n00:09:21.696 --> 00:09:28.211\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Florida, 32, I don't know, 607.\n\n188\n00:09:28.211 --> 00:09:31.771\n813-555-1212.\n\n189\n00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:39.311\nAnd for my email it's actually\nlucina.larry@aol.com, whoops.\n\n190\n00:09:41.237 --> 00:09:46.090\n@aol.com, and hopefully you can see\nI'm duplicating the email address from\n\n191\n00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.380\nthe record above, all right?\n\n192\n00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:53.428\nSo when I hit Tab to finish this,\nit says nope, I cannot do that.\n\n193\n00:09:53.428 --> 00:09:57.863\nThe changes were not successful because\nthey would create duplicate values\n\n194\n00:09:57.863 --> 00:10:00.990\nin the index, primary key,\nor relationship.\n\n195\n00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.400\nIn this case, it's my unique index\nthat I've placed on this column.\n\n196\n00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.214\n&gt;&gt; And that actually, for\nsome layman's terms or whatever,\n\n197\n00:10:09.214 --> 00:10:11.741\nthey would be like, what's an index?\n\n198\n00:10:11.741 --> 00:10:16.405\nBut now going through these courses or\nthese episodes, I'm like okay,\n\n199\n00:10:16.405 --> 00:10:19.940\nindex is just,\nit's really like this particular thing.\n\n200\n00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:24.830\nThis field, this entry,\nwhich can be a little confusing to people.\n\n201\n00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:29.880\n&gt;&gt; A book has an index, each column\nin my table can have an index to help\n\n202\n00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.700\nme find very particular values, help me do\nsorting operations, and search operations.\n\n203\n00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.440\nSo each column can have its own index.\n\n204\n00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.980\nYou can do a combination of columns even.\n\n205\n00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.410\nI might wanna make a unique constraint,\nnot a primary key, right?\n\n206\n00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.389\nUnique constraint across multiple columns.\n\n207\n00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:52.269\nYou might wanna make sure, I always\nthink back cuz I ran into this when I\n\n208\n00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:57.345\nwas doing my music collection at home,\nwhere I have albums and artists.\n\n209\n00:10:57.345 --> 00:11:00.272\nAnd I couldn't, there was something,\nand what was I doing?\n\n210\n00:11:00.272 --> 00:11:03.470\nI think it had to do\nwith the live recording.\n\n211\n00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.970\nAnyway, I made a combination of\nfields that had to be unique.\n\n212\n00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.210\nSo this field on its own\ndidn't have to be unique,\n\n213\n00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.530\nfield number two on its own\ndidn't have to be unique.\n\n214\n00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.020\nBut the combination of\nthe two had to be unique.\n\n215\n00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.386\n&gt;&gt; Or maybe one, two, three.\n\n216\n00:11:16.386 --> 00:11:17.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n217\n00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:20.473\n&gt;&gt; Because you could have somebody\nlike same artist, same song, but\n\n218\n00:11:20.473 --> 00:11:23.104\nthen they reissued it or\nsomething to that effect.\n\n219\n00:11:23.104 --> 00:11:24.233\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, mm-hm, exactly.\n\n220\n00:11:24.233 --> 00:11:26.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so like on a different album.\n\n221\n00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:26.810\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n222\n00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:27.450\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so.\n\n223\n00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:31.162\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's say, and if I just\ngo and I change this just a little bit,\n\n224\n00:11:31.162 --> 00:11:32.270\njust put a 2 in there.\n\n225\n00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.130\nNow it lets me enter\nthat record no problem,\n\n226\n00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.060\nbecause it's no longer\nduplicating anything, right?\n\n227\n00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.660\nIt is unique.\n\n228\n00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.198\nSo a great little way to make sure\nyou're entering in unique values,\n\n229\n00:11:42.198 --> 00:11:45.050\nis just to put a unique\nconstraint on the column.\n\n230\n00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.639\nAnd I can do it on individual columns.\n\n231\n00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:51.430\nIt wouldn't make sense here, but I could\nalso put one here, and put one here.\n\n232\n00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:55.187\nSo there's no limit, well there\nis a limit, 255, but you can put,\n\n233\n00:11:55.187 --> 00:11:58.587\neach column can have its own\nseparate unique requirement to it.\n\n234\n00:11:58.587 --> 00:12:04.044\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, social security number,\nemail, work extension number.\n\n235\n00:12:04.044 --> 00:12:08.327\nBecause you can only have one\nextension for one person.\n\n236\n00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:12.850\nI can see multiple ways or many\nexamples of where you'd wanna do this.\n\n237\n00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:14.100\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, all right.\n\n238\n00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:18.990\nSo let's jump back over to this, so that's\nthe unique constraint, and what I'm gonna\n\n239\n00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:24.150\ndo is I'm gonna undo that, because it\nwill effect my next demonstration.\n\n240\n00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.850\nI'm gonna turn this back\nto not indexed at all.\n\n241\n00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:31.400\nI'll save it just to get rid of that.\n\n242\n00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.802\nAnd the next one I wanna talk about is\n\n243\n00:12:34.802 --> 00:12:35.769\nthe-\n&gt;&gt; Required.\n\n244\n00:12:35.769 --> 00:12:36.375\n&gt;&gt; Required, thank you.\n\n245\n00:12:36.375 --> 00:12:38.087\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Brain cramp.\n\n246\n00:12:38.087 --> 00:12:39.346\nAll right, it is required.\n\n247\n00:12:39.346 --> 00:12:43.160\nAnd again, another one that\npretty much defines itself.\n\n248\n00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.850\nIf I turn on Required Yes,\nor Required True,\n\n249\n00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:52.250\nthen that's telling me that I have to\nenter something for that particular field.\n\n250\n00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:57.730\nSo we use this when we have important\nfields that maybe other things rely on,\n\n251\n00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:03.000\nor just as a business process must be\nin place for everything else to work.\n\n252\n00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.290\n&gt;&gt; I mean if you're having your owners or\nyour clients, they have to have a name.\n\n253\n00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.030\nSo you have to have their last name or\n\n254\n00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.702\nsomething that you're going\nto be referring to them.\n\n255\n00:13:10.702 --> 00:13:13.100\nIt's not like, hey you, how you doing?\n\n256\n00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.055\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wouldn't want my\nsalespeople to record new customers or\n\n257\n00:13:16.055 --> 00:13:19.494\npotential sales leads, and not put some\nway to contact that new sales lead,\n\n258\n00:13:19.494 --> 00:13:21.933\ncuz it's pretty much useless\nat this point, right?\n\n259\n00:13:21.933 --> 00:13:23.653\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n260\n00:13:23.653 --> 00:13:25.427\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, that would be an example of\n\n261\n00:13:25.427 --> 00:13:27.550\nsomething you might wanna require.\n\n262\n00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:32.090\nAgain if you think back to a primary key,\nlet's select the primary key for\n\n263\n00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:34.520\nthis table, and come down here.\n\n264\n00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.646\nIndexed, yes, no duplicates,\nit's not gonna show me.\n\n265\n00:13:37.646 --> 00:13:39.654\nBecause it's a auto increment,\n\n266\n00:13:39.654 --> 00:13:44.684\nit doesn't show me the required because\naccess does, and it will be there always.\n\n267\n00:13:44.684 --> 00:13:50.056\nI was gonna say though that primary key,\njust like a primary key contains a unique\n\n268\n00:13:50.056 --> 00:13:55.037\nconstraint, a primary key also\ncontains a required constraint, right?\n\n269\n00:13:55.037 --> 00:14:00.580\nBecause a primary key by definition\nhas to be unique, cannot be null.\n\n270\n00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.150\nSo in other words it's required, right?\n\n271\n00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:07.550\nBut that doesn't mean I can't require\nother fields that are not my primary key\n\n272\n00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:08.580\nto be required.\n\n273\n00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.236\nIf that's not redundant.\n\n274\n00:14:09.236 --> 00:14:12.016\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Force other fields [LAUGH] in\n\n275\n00:14:12.016 --> 00:14:16.100\nmy table to be required even though\nthey're not the primary key.\n\n276\n00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.540\nLike again, we could go back\nto social security number.\n\n277\n00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:24.080\nAs an employer I must have\nyour social security number so\n\n278\n00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:29.020\nthat I can do my part and pay taxes,\nreport taxes, all that good stuff, right?\n\n279\n00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:33.361\nSo when I'm entering new employees,\nwhile the social security number is not\n\n280\n00:14:33.361 --> 00:14:36.047\nthe primary key for\nthat row, I have to have it.\n\n281\n00:14:36.047 --> 00:14:39.953\nAnd I don't want anybody entering in a new\nemployee without getting their social\n\n282\n00:14:39.953 --> 00:14:41.282\nsecurity number, right?\n\n283\n00:14:41.282 --> 00:14:44.999\nBecause that proves that they're in the\nsystem, that I can't get in trouble if I\n\n284\n00:14:44.999 --> 00:14:48.445\nget audited and don't have social\nsecurity numbers for my employees, and\n\n285\n00:14:48.445 --> 00:14:50.170\nall kinds of things like that.\n\n286\n00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:55.320\nSo that's the idea behind Required is\njust saying, hey, I must have a value.\n\n287\n00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.110\nSo let's see how that works,\nlet's go back down to email.\n\n288\n00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:02.140\nAgain I set it back to the default so\nthere's no unique constraint on here.\n\n289\n00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.520\nAnd I'm gonna go to this Required, right?\n\n290\n00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.053\nAnd we're gonna change that to,\njust gonna move this,\n\n291\n00:15:09.053 --> 00:15:11.165\nwe'll see if I hit the right one.\n\n292\n00:15:11.165 --> 00:15:11.733\nYes!\n\n293\n00:15:11.733 --> 00:15:12.653\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n294\n00:15:12.653 --> 00:15:14.317\n&gt;&gt; Without seeing it, so yes.\n\n295\n00:15:14.317 --> 00:15:17.925\nBut now Required is set to Yes, so\nI'll go ahead and save that, and\n\n296\n00:15:17.925 --> 00:15:21.995\nit's gonna tell me that I'm\nchanging my integrity rules, right?\n\n297\n00:15:21.995 --> 00:15:25.140\nThat existing data may not be valid for\nnew rules,\n\n298\n00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.900\nthe process may take a long time.\n\n299\n00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.971\nDo you want the existing data\nto be tested with the new rules?\n\n300\n00:15:29.971 --> 00:15:31.370\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and say Yes.\n\n301\n00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:34.690\nSo basically what this is saying is,\nI'm getting ready to\n\n302\n00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:38.600\nnow add a requirement to this column,\nthe fact that it's required.\n\n303\n00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.035\nYou might already have 10,000 rows\nin this table, before you realize,\n\n304\n00:15:43.035 --> 00:15:44.995\nman we should make that required.\n\n305\n00:15:44.995 --> 00:15:46.373\nAre we talking about Required?\n\n306\n00:15:46.373 --> 00:15:46.958\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n307\n00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:48.913\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You should make, and\n\n308\n00:15:48.913 --> 00:15:51.633\nI lot my train of thought completely.\n\n309\n00:15:51.633 --> 00:15:55.606\nWe got 10,000 rows in there, and\nnow you're saying it's required.\n\n310\n00:15:55.606 --> 00:15:59.583\nI'm gonna have to go back,\nthe database is gonna have to go back and\n\n311\n00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:03.780\ncheck every one of those, and\nmake sure they are Not null, right?\n\n312\n00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:04.820\nWhich could take time.\n\n313\n00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.776\nSo that's what it's saying.\n\n314\n00:16:05.776 --> 00:16:10.790\nIt may take a long time, do you want the\nexisting data to be tested with new rules?\n\n315\n00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:16.410\nAnd honestly, if you have a huge data set,\nyou're probably better off saying no.\n\n316\n00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:19.080\nFrom now on, make sure it's required.\n\n317\n00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.860\nBut for all the existing stuff,\n\n318\n00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.700\nI've got an easier way to tell\nif that field is null or not.\n\n319\n00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.770\nSo don't bother going through and\nchecking it, right?\n\n320\n00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:28.300\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's still applying?\n\n321\n00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.770\nCuz when you say no,\nit almost means you're not gonna do this.\n\n322\n00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:32.850\nIt's almost like don't save, but no-\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n323\n00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.780\n&gt;&gt; Keep the restraint from here forward.\n\n324\n00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.870\n&gt;&gt; It's a twisty one, right, yes?\n\n325\n00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:37.912\n&gt;&gt; It's a clarification.\n\n326\n00:16:37.912 --> 00:16:40.613\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Apply it and apply it to existing.\n\n327\n00:16:40.613 --> 00:16:43.740\nNo, apply it, but\ndon't apply it to existing.\n\n328\n00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.591\nCancel, I'm not sure what to choose,\nnever mind, and\n\n329\n00:16:46.591 --> 00:16:48.420\njust stop the process altogether.\n\n330\n00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.870\nAll right, okay, so we'll go ahead and say\nyes because I don't have a lot of data.\n\n331\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:56.300\nAnd now we'll flip over\nto my data sheet view.\n\n332\n00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.500\nAnd let's go down here and\nwe're going to enter in a new record,\n\n333\n00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.240\nand I'll just skip the name,\nwell I hate doing that.\n\n334\n00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.165\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You just can't do it, can you?\n\n335\n00:17:07.165 --> 00:17:12.680\n&gt;&gt; No, let's do Vonne Smith,\n432 Any Ave, Gainesville.\n\n336\n00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:20.000\nThis is when I need Excel to hey, you've\ntyped that value in this column before.\n\n337\n00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:22.945\nWhy don't you just do it again?\n\n338\n00:17:22.945 --> 00:17:24.875\n608, or 698, good enough.\n\n339\n00:17:24.875 --> 00:17:28.509\n213-555-1212.\n&gt;&gt; I like the 813 shoutout.\n\n340\n00:17:28.509 --> 00:17:30.618\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you like that?\n\n341\n00:17:30.618 --> 00:17:31.517\nOld school Tampa.\n\n342\n00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:32.635\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n343\n00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:34.475\n&gt;&gt; All right, and\nwhat else will you require?\n\n344\n00:17:34.475 --> 00:17:38.855\nSo I'm going to leave her email blank and\nI'm gonna tab.\n\n345\n00:17:38.855 --> 00:17:43.025\nIt says nope, you must enter in a value.\n\n346\n00:17:43.025 --> 00:17:46.529\nSo I'll click OK, and I'll put Vonne.\n\n347\n00:17:46.529 --> 00:17:48.480\nDid I put an extra N in there?\n\n348\n00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.140\nAt least there's no Y, right?\n\n349\n00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.497\n&gt;&gt; My name has been misspelled so\nmany different ways my whole life,\n\n350\n00:17:53.497 --> 00:17:57.272\nmispronounced, misspelled, it's-\n&gt;&gt; So you need a simple name like Mike and\n\n351\n00:17:57.272 --> 00:17:59.090\nthen you don't have to worry about that.\n\n352\n00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.121\n&gt;&gt; I don't think Vonne's that complicated.\n\n353\n00:18:01.121 --> 00:18:02.880\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right and so\n\n354\n00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.042\nnow if I tab out of it, you'll see that\nI'm down to the next record which means I\n\n355\n00:18:07.042 --> 00:18:09.030\nmust have been successful.\n\n356\n00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:12.750\nSo, setting it to required\nmeans when you go in and\n\n357\n00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.490\nenter in a new record,\nyou must put something in this field.\n\n358\n00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:19.982\n&gt;&gt; And I could see you combining\nthis with input masks.\n\n359\n00:18:19.982 --> 00:18:22.127\nAnd things like, for\nexample, that phone number,\n\n360\n00:18:22.127 --> 00:18:24.090\nsomebody could type in the letter L.\n\n361\n00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:28.150\nIf you didn't have, no you have to put it\nin as ten digits, all that kind of stuff.\n\n362\n00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.310\nLike for the e-mail address, I know you\nsaid it was a little bit more complicated\n\n363\n00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:33.230\nto like, does it have an @ and\nblah, blah, blah.\n\n364\n00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:37.880\nBut you would say, no it has to be\nalso in this particular format,\n\n365\n00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.190\nnot just you put in blah.\n\n366\n00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.700\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; But we already kind of covered that so\n\n367\n00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.070\nyou would combine those two together.\n\n368\n00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:48.350\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, now we are going to\ntake a little bit of a twist here.\n\n369\n00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:52.040\nSo everybody put on their little thinking\ncaps because I want to show you something\n\n370\n00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.070\nelse that gets a little\nbit confusing to people.\n\n371\n00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.950\nSo, I just entered Vonne's email address.\n\n372\n00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:58.600\nIt was required.\n\n373\n00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.350\nIt forced me to do it.\n\n374\n00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:04.020\nNow I'm gonna go back to this record and\nI'm gonna take her email address out.\n\n375\n00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:07.920\nAnd it let me do it, all right?\n\n376\n00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:14.370\nIt allowed me to leave this field blank\neven though it's a required field.\n\n377\n00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.170\n&gt;&gt; That's a little odd.\n\n378\n00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.260\nBut if you're saying it's required,\nbut I can go back and remove it?\n\n379\n00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:24.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and what this comes\ndown to is a very crazy little\n\n380\n00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.580\nconcept that there's a difference between\nsomething known as a null value and\n\n381\n00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:33.040\nsomething known as a zero-length string.\n\n382\n00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:38.490\nA null value is an unknown, that means\nI don't know if there is data or\n\n383\n00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.540\nis not data, I just don't know, right?\n\n384\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:42.920\n&gt;&gt; But it's still blank.\n\n385\n00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.720\n&gt;&gt; It looks blank to us, right?\n\n386\n00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n387\n00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.810\nif you're entering in a new record and\nyou just tab right past that field,\n\n388\n00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:55.350\nyou're not telling Access whether\nthis is supposed to be blank or\n\n389\n00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.450\nit's blank because I forgot\nto enter in the data.\n\n390\n00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.550\nSo Access doesn't know, right?\n\n391\n00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:03.170\nIt's a null value, it's an unknown value.\n\n392\n00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:06.590\nAnd that's not allowed when\nwe choose required, right?\n\n393\n00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:10.980\nWhen you set something to required,\nnull values are not allowed, but\n\n394\n00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:15.360\nby default,\nzero length strings are allowed.\n\n395\n00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:21.620\nSo when I came in here and deleted all\nthis, there's still a string in there,\n\n396\n00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:25.670\nsome data was there, now I'm just\nsaying that there's no characters.\n\n397\n00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:27.580\nBut it's still a value that I put in.\n\n398\n00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.660\nI told Access there's nothing to put here.\n\n399\n00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:35.070\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's like\n&gt;&gt; It's twisty.\n\n400\n00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.798\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n401\n00:20:35.798 --> 00:20:39.279\nI think that when you say null is unknown,\n\n402\n00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:44.553\nbecause to me I always thought\nnull is blank, null is nothing,\n\n403\n00:20:44.553 --> 00:20:48.880\nbut-\n&gt;&gt; Null could be nothing.\n\n404\n00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.320\n&gt;&gt; Nothing [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It could be 500.\n\n405\n00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.295\nIt could be mike@itpro.tv.\n\n406\n00:20:53.295 --> 00:20:56.030\nNull means you don't know if it's blank or\nnot.\n\n407\n00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:57.740\n&gt;&gt; But since you made that required,\n\n408\n00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.870\nyou're saying you had\nto type something in.\n\n409\n00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:06.000\nBut then you came back and erased it.\n\n410\n00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.820\nSo Access knows that you're purposefully\nleaving it without any information.\n\n411\n00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.600\nSo it's-\n&gt;&gt; It's now Azure link string.\n\n412\n00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not unknown.\n\n413\n00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.900\nI now know that you did this?\n\n414\n00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.318\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n415\n00:21:21.318 --> 00:21:22.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\n\n416\n00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.530\nit's weird to think about it that way\nbecause they look exactly the same, right?\n\n417\n00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:31.680\nWhen it displays it, a null value and\na zero-length string look the same.\n\n418\n00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.240\nBut if you ever try to\ndo an equality thing, or\n\n419\n00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.520\ndo a query, null and zero-length\nstrings do not equal each other.\n\n420\n00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.780\nAll right, it's kinda twisty.\n\n421\n00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.320\nAnd it's beyond what we really\nneed to talk about here.\n\n422\n00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.010\nBut it is something to keep in mind.\n\n423\n00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.630\n&gt;&gt; It's been a hard one for\nme to wrap around.\n\n424\n00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:49.990\nI hear you all talk\nabout this all the time.\n\n425\n00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:54.390\nAnd it's sinking in a little\nbit more every time\n\n426\n00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:56.300\neverybody else says it in a different way.\n\n427\n00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.260\nI'm like, okay.\n\n428\n00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:04.680\nIt's more like how we talk and\nhow we see, versus how the computer and\n\n429\n00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.590\nthe language sees it and it is well.\n\n430\n00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.098\n&gt;&gt; And so we need to be able to\ncontrol this process, right?\n\n431\n00:22:11.098 --> 00:22:16.069\nFor some things you might want that\ncapability where right now email is\n\n432\n00:22:16.069 --> 00:22:20.310\nrequired but I can go back and\nblank it out if I need to.\n\n433\n00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:23.330\nI know that this is not\nthe correct email anymore.\n\n434\n00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:25.435\nI don't know what their new email is, but\n\n435\n00:22:25.435 --> 00:22:29.930\nI don't want anybody using this email in\nthe mean time until I get their new email.\n\n436\n00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:33.910\nSo I can go ahead and\nI can erase it, and hit Enter, and\n\n437\n00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:36.510\nit's now a zero-length string, all right?\n\n438\n00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:38.830\n&gt;&gt; And then you could go back and\nsee, you know what?\n\n439\n00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:42.880\nMaybe the next person that's helping\nhowever that person is went,\n\n440\n00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.360\nI see that your email is blank.\n\n441\n00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.100\nHey, can I go ahead and get your new\nemail address cuz we need to contact you?\n\n442\n00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:48.910\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n443\n00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:49.570\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But there\n\n444\n00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:52.170\nmight be times when you\ndon't want that behavior.\n\n445\n00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:53.860\nWhat if it's a price list?\n\n446\n00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.630\nAll your items and their cost.\n\n447\n00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.880\nAnd let's say the cost of one\nof the items is changing.\n\n448\n00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.870\nWell, I don't want anybody\nto delete the cost, right?\n\n449\n00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:07.020\nLeave the old cost until we\nknow what the new cost is and\n\n450\n00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.840\nthen update it with the new cost.\n\n451\n00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:13.700\nBut during that time, it can't be blank\nbecause I've got other processes, orders,\n\n452\n00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:17.190\nthat are multiplying that cost times five\nto figure out what their total is so\n\n453\n00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:18.350\nwe can charge them.\n\n454\n00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.170\nSo I can't have that being\na zero-length string.\n\n455\n00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:26.467\n&gt;&gt; Okay you just clicked on something,\nbecause at another job, at the university,\n\n456\n00:23:26.467 --> 00:23:31.687\nI can't remember the specific, but\nthere was, like well you can't change this\n\n457\n00:23:31.687 --> 00:23:36.643\nuntil you have the new class registration\nnumber, or something like that.\n\n458\n00:23:36.643 --> 00:23:38.360\nAnd I'm like, well no,\nwhy don't we just go ahead and delete it.\n\n459\n00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.920\nAnd they're like no, you can't do that,\nthe system won't let you.\n\n460\n00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:41.574\nAnd I'm like, why?\n\n461\n00:23:41.574 --> 00:23:43.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm sitting there going well why not?\n\n462\n00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:46.870\nI need to get rid of it, and you have\nto replace it with something and so\n\n463\n00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:48.560\nI was like,\nI bet you that's what they did.\n\n464\n00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.296\n&gt;&gt; This is probably exactly what they did.\n\n465\n00:23:50.296 --> 00:23:55.660\nThey set it to required, like we did, but\nthey added one more constraint to it.\n\n466\n00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.760\nLet's go back over to our\ndesign view here First,\n\n467\n00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.973\nlet me just put some e-mail\naddresses back in here.\n\n468\n00:23:59.973 --> 00:24:04.736\nMike@some.com, and\n\n469\n00:24:04.736 --> 00:24:10.692\nthis is vonne@nonya.com.\n\n470\n00:24:10.692 --> 00:24:13.540\nYeah, I make up a lot of fake e-mails.\n\n471\n00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:17.060\n&gt;&gt;

It's easier just to say\nyou jsut can't do that.\n\n479\n00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.642\n&gt;&gt; This is just the way you have to do it.\n\n480\n00:24:33.642 --> 00:24:34.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n481\n00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.400\nlet's go back over to design view.\n\n482\n00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.570\nAnd we've already got it set to required,\nbut\n\n483\n00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:42.710\nwe saw that even if though it is required,\nafter the fact, I can go back and\n\n484\n00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:45.330\nblank it out and\nset it to a zero link string.\n\n485\n00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:49.661\nWell, right below required is something\ncalled allow zero length, and\n\n486\n00:24:49.661 --> 00:24:53.980\nit's set to yes, which is why I\ncould erase an existing e-mail.\n\n487\n00:24:53.980 --> 00:25:00.420\nIf I don't want that behavior,\nI simply change that one to no, right?\n\n488\n00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:03.050\nSo required, yes, zero length, no.\n\n489\n00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:05.340\nYou're gonna save it.\n\n490\n00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:07.320\nAnd yes to our changes.\n\n491\n00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.740\nWe'll say go back over\nto the data sheet view.\n\n492\n00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:16.006\nAnd so now, if I enter in a new record,\n\n493\n00:25:16.006 --> 00:25:20.129\nall right, so this is Titus.\n\n494\n00:25:20.129 --> 00:25:21.722\nI misspelled his name there.\n\n495\n00:25:21.722 --> 00:25:27.290\n1,2,3 name street.\n\n496\n00:25:28.754 --> 00:25:30.919\nCan't type today.\n\n497\n00:25:30.919 --> 00:25:32.360\n&gt;&gt;
