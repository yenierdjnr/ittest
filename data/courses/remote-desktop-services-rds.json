watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:15.090\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nRemote Desktop Services show.\n\n5\n00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.170\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.540\nIf you're wondering how to start and where\nto begin to build up this network service,\n\n7\n00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.000\nwell then,\nyou are definitely in the right place.\n\n8\n00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.500\nBecause today, we have Mr. Ronnie Wong in\nstudios to introduce us to this concept.\n\n9\n00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.950\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.710\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\n\n11\n00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.300\nhaving me here as we begin to take\na look at remote desktop services.\n\n12\n00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.340\nSo when we start talking about this\nparticular concept, most of the time,\n\n13\n00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.290\nthere's a reason why we need this, right?\n\n14\n00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.440\nWe find out that there's some\nparticular implementation\n\n15\n00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.150\nthat we're told that we need to have.\n\n16\n00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.380\nBut a lot of times if you're brand new to\nthis, and you just turned on this show,\n\n17\n00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.610\nand you go that seems interesting,\nlet's do that,\n\n18\n00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.110\nyou may not know why we're talking\nabout it or why we need it.\n\n19\n00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.638\nSo that's what we wanna begin with.\n\n20\n00:00:57.638 --> 00:01:00.240\nAnd we wanna make sure that we understand\nwhy in the world we're actually\n\n21\n00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.460\ntrying to use this.\n\n22\n00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.650\nAnd then,\nwe're gonna begin with an implementation\n\n23\n00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.700\nthat will allow you to just get started,\nright?\n\n24\n00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.950\nAnd this doesn't necessarily mean it's\ngonna be the best implementation.\n\n25\n00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.895\nIt is going to be something in which we\nget started with, which we call a single\n\n26\n00:01:14.895 --> 00:01:18.434\nserver type of build, but\nwe'll talk about the reason behind that.\n\n27\n00:01:18.434 --> 00:01:20.923\nAnd then we'll also talk about\nhow we get it set up, and\n\n28\n00:01:20.923 --> 00:01:24.220\nthat's what we'll hope to cover\nin this particular episode.\n\n29\n00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.914\nSo, Cherokee, the idea of remote desktop\nservices, we're pretty familiar with it.\n\n30\n00:01:28.914 --> 00:01:32.500\nI've actually got this running in\na couple different companies before.\n\n31\n00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.435\nCherokee, I think you've done the same, so\nlet's talk about the needs that we found\n\n32\n00:01:36.435 --> 00:01:40.130\nout inside of the companies before\nwhen we've done something like this.\n\n33\n00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so Ronnie, I don't know if\nyou knew this, but many moons ago,\n\n34\n00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.700\nI was an on-site repair technician, and\n\n35\n00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.440\nI never really knew what kind\nof job I was walking into.\n\n36\n00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.043\nSometimes I wouldn't get too much\nnotes about the particular client,\n\n37\n00:01:54.043 --> 00:01:56.937\nI'd walk up and\nnot really know who was behind that door.\n\n38\n00:01:56.937 --> 00:02:01.665\nOverall, though, everyone in my experience\nwas pretty cool, humans in general,\n\n39\n00:02:01.665 --> 00:02:04.830\nI found, they were easygoing, right?\n\n40\n00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.170\nBut I approached a door one day, and\n\n41\n00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.010\nit was a woman who had a small business\nand her hard drive actually failed.\n\n42\n00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.450\nSo I would carry around all these parts\nin my trunk, I know it's kind of crazy.\n\n43\n00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.104\nAnd I had to fix her system, and we\nbrought the operating system back up, and\n\n44\n00:02:21.104 --> 00:02:24.108\nshe had a flash drive of\nher QuickBooks backups.\n\n45\n00:02:24.108 --> 00:02:26.890\nAnd we were able to go ahead and\ninstall and bring them back up.\n\n46\n00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.060\nBut she hadn't created her backups,\nbut a few months ago.\n\n47\n00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.867\nSo she lost all the information\nbecause of that hardware failure.\n\n48\n00:02:33.867 --> 00:02:38.078\nNow, for a small business, that may be\nacceptable, not necessarily acceptable,\n\n49\n00:02:38.078 --> 00:02:42.270\nbut she might have not been able to\nafford a more expensive implementation.\n\n50\n00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.730\nOn the business side,\nwe really don't allow for\n\n51\n00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.390\nthose types of problems or we shouldn't.\n\n52\n00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.270\nWe should try to mitigate those by\nimplementing something like RDS.\n\n53\n00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.380\nSo in this show, we'll be looking at how\nto go ahead and set it up and explain\n\n54\n00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.350\nwhy it's useful and just how to configure\nthat and different things here, right?\n\n55\n00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that pretty much helps us\nto summarize a couple of different\n\n56\n00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.350\nthings, right?\n\n57\n00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.250\nOne, there is a need and an implementation\nof things like the loss of data.\n\n58\n00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.700\nThe very fact that people continually\nin a business environment,\n\n59\n00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.620\nwhether you're talking about\njust a regular work group, or\n\n60\n00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.810\nyou're talking about\nan Active Directory network.\n\n61\n00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.370\nPeople will still continue to rely on\ntheir desktop machines as if they're\n\n62\n00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.240\ndedicated machines that can withstand\nany type of disaster that's out there.\n\n63\n00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.430\nAnd the problem with those hard drives\nis that they're relatively cheap and\n\n64\n00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.190\nthey shouldn't be relied on for anything\nin which is gonna be very mission critical\n\n65\n00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.520\nor anything that's a valuable data.\n\n66\n00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.514\nThats why of course inside of a business,\nwe constantly tell them,\n\n67\n00:03:39.514 --> 00:03:41.470\nplease store things in your shared folder.\n\n68\n00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.636\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n69\n00:03:42.636 --> 00:03:46.023\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we can back those things up very\neasily instead of what you're talking\n\n70\n00:03:46.023 --> 00:03:48.110\nabout where you're backing up everything.\n\n71\n00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.910\nAnd then now you have to go and figure\nout how do I get that data off of there,\n\n72\n00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:52.785\ncan I recover it?\n\n73\n00:03:52.785 --> 00:03:57.285\nWell, that's some of the things in which\nyou begin to do, but if you're trying to\n\n74\n00:03:57.285 --> 00:04:01.560\nrepair that and do that machine by\nmachine, it becomes very costly.\n\n75\n00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.320\nSo there comes a point in\nwhich you might try and\n\n76\n00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.780\nlook for another solution in which\nis where I kind of came in at\n\n77\n00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.610\na remote desktop solution is that I\nended up getting for a company here.\n\n78\n00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.690\nThey said here's what\nwe need to implement,\n\n79\n00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.420\nand here's what we want to try and do.\n\n80\n00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.310\nSo what happened is that they started\n\n81\n00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.850\nto come to the end of life of\nwhere their machines were.\n\n82\n00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.180\nSo they normally tried to\nreplace them every three years,\n\n83\n00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.780\nbut in this particular economy at\nthat point in time, they said,\n\n84\n00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.430\nwe can't afford to replace the 75 or\n100 computers.\n\n85\n00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.880\nWhat can we do if we were to try and\ndo it for this much amount of money?\n\n86\n00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.150\nAnd we still need for everybody to\nhave a machine in front of them.\n\n87\n00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.560\nWe still need it to do things,\nlike they don't know anything's happened.\n\n88\n00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.156\nBut those older machines were no longer\nable to run the software that they needed\n\n89\n00:04:51.156 --> 00:04:53.363\nfor their client management system.\n\n90\n00:04:53.363 --> 00:04:55.630\nI was trying to remember what it's called,\nthe CMS.\n\n91\n00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.281\nSome type of client management system that\nthey were having, so they needed more\n\n92\n00:04:59.281 --> 00:05:03.104\npowerful computers, but they didn't have\nbrand new computers that could do that.\n\n93\n00:05:03.104 --> 00:05:06.738\nThey also of course needed to be able\nto control what was being put on those\n\n94\n00:05:06.738 --> 00:05:10.313\ncomputers, there were a lot of malware\ninfections that were going on in\n\n95\n00:05:10.313 --> 00:05:12.000\ntheir systems, and you name it.\n\n96\n00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.800\nThey weren't able to do a lot of that.\n\n97\n00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.290\nThey had to continue\nto fight against that.\n\n98\n00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.470\nSo one of the recommendations\nby the company I work for\n\n99\n00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.760\nsaid let's think about this idea\nof remote desktop services.\n\n100\n00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.990\n&gt;&gt; So, when you mention malware, so\nlet's say that individual's machine was\n\n101\n00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.770\ninfected, and from a business perspective,\nlike we spoke about before,\n\n102\n00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.450\ninstead of finding that root cause,\ncleaning the machine.\n\n103\n00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.330\nIf that individual had stored their\ninformation in the shared folder or\n\n104\n00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.078\nsome other alternative, then you could\njust completely blow out that machine,\n\n105\n00:05:40.078 --> 00:05:44.680\nre-image it, get it back up and running,\nor just swap that machine out for\n\n106\n00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.110\nthat end user, and they would\nstill have access to their files.\n\n107\n00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.680\nQuick, easy solution.\n\n108\n00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.720\n&gt;&gt; Right, quick and easy, but\nit's still costly in terms of time, right?\n\n109\n00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.160\nRegardless of how fast your systems\nare and bringing somebody down\n\n110\n00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.480\nduring a workday to re-image your system,\ngetting them set back up.\n\n111\n00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.361\nIt sounds like something that's easy,\nand it's easier than not doing it.\n\n112\n00:06:04.361 --> 00:06:08.550\nOf course, it's easier than trying to\nfigure it all out, but time is still\n\n113\n00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.570\nthe issue, okay, so what we presented\ninstead was a remote desktop solution.\n\n114\n00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.280\nWhere they could, instead, everybody could\nhave still the same machines that they\n\n115\n00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.950\nwere on, which were older computers, we\nwere extending the life of those machines.\n\n116\n00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.010\nInstead, they would get a desktop\npresented to them by the actual\n\n117\n00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.200\nremote desktop services found inside\nof Windows Server 2008 by that point.\n\n118\n00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.900\nBut we can also do it in Server 2012,\nR2 is what we're gonna be doing here.\n\n119\n00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.650\nSo, all that can actually be extended and\nhelps us out.\n\n120\n00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.950\nSo in this particular situation, you might\nfind out that this is what has to happen,\n\n121\n00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.130\nis that you might have this type\nof solution where you go, look,\n\n122\n00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.120\nhere's what we need, and\nthis is probably the best solution.\n\n123\n00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.150\nOne, it gives them a desktop in which\nwe're gonna be able to control, okay,\n\n124\n00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.510\nwhich is key.\n\n125\n00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:00.320\nThe very fact is, we can control whether\nor not they can install software.\n\n126\n00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.100\nAnd we might say, look, they're not\ninstalling any software at all.\n\n127\n00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.090\nIf there's software installations\nthat we need to have,\n\n128\n00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.860\nthen it's controlled by me or by Cherokee.\n\n129\n00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.890\nAnd I say, Cherokee, yes, this is\nallowed or we say, no, it's not allowed,\n\n130\n00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.530\nwe're not gonna allow that to happen.\n\n131\n00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:19.890\nWe, of course, can also then redirect\ntheir storage to a centralized location,\n\n132\n00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.770\nand the user doesn't really\nhave to know about it.\n\n133\n00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.760\nSo, using even things like group\npolicy that we normally find in\n\n134\n00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.760\nan Active Directory network,\nwe of course then can say look,\n\n135\n00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.570\nhere's where your My Documents\nfolder is gonna be.\n\n136\n00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.790\nIt looks just like that on your desktop,\nthe one that you had before.\n\n137\n00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.310\nAnd you're gonna save\nit in the same place.\n\n138\n00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.290\nSo everything actually ends up working\nthe way that you want it to, okay?\n\n139\n00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.334\nSo in that particular sense,\n\n140\n00:07:42.334 --> 00:07:47.977\nwe can essentially eliminate a lot of the\npitfalls of just having a regular desktop\n\n141\n00:07:47.977 --> 00:07:53.320\nsystem by worrying about things like\npower supply units and stuff like that.\n\n142\n00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.837\nIf those machines are still up and\nrunning,\n\n143\n00:07:54.837 --> 00:07:56.580\nwe don't have to worry\nabout upgrading them.\n\n144\n00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.889\nThey simply log in.\n\n145\n00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:01.339\nThey're opening that remote desktop\nconnection, and they're ready to go, and\n\n146\n00:08:01.339 --> 00:08:03.400\nwe can do stuff like that as well.\n\n147\n00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.030\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, we say RDS for\nRemote Desk, excuse me.\n\n148\n00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:07.920\n&gt;&gt; Desktop Services, yep.\n\n149\n00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.120\n&gt;&gt; Desktop services, I was like okay,\nI forgot for a second.\n\n150\n00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.670\nBut if we kind of compare that to\nanother term you may have heard, VDI,\n\n151\n00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:19.620\nVirtual Desktop Infrastructure, it's a\nlittle confusing because they're similar,\n\n152\n00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.350\nbut not exactly the same, right.\n\n153\n00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:26.120\nIf you hear that term out in the field,\nRDS is exclusive to Microsoft,\n\n154\n00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.200\nso Microsoft's technology, so obviously\nthat's the environment you'll be using and\n\n155\n00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.560\nwe will be using here.\n\n156\n00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.100\nIf you hear the term VDI,\nVDI can be used for other vendors and\n\n157\n00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.090\nVDI is really going to be saying, look,\nwe are not centralizing, sharing out one\n\n158\n00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:44.940\nparticular operating system, we're giving\neach end user a virtual machine that\n\n159\n00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:49.200\nthey're connecting to remotely, whereas\nwith remote desktop services, they're\n\n160\n00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.720\nsharing that operating system, of course,\nlicensing, that's a whole another issue.\n\n161\n00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.910\nOkay, you still have to pay for those\nusers connecting or machines connecting.\n\n162\n00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:03.990\nBut, You're just remoting in\nthose graphics, those commands.\n\n163\n00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.710\nSo you're all remoting into\nthat one operating system.\n\n164\n00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.720\nThere's not a virtual machine for\nevery single end user.\n\n165\n00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:15.605\nSo the underlying component, they're\na little bit different there with RDS and\n\n166\n00:09:15.605 --> 00:09:18.065\nVDI but just kind of look\ninto that if you wanted to.\n\n167\n00:09:18.065 --> 00:09:20.679\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and it is confusing\nbecause language is different but\n\n168\n00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:21.808\nit's vendor specific.\n\n169\n00:09:21.808 --> 00:09:25.979\nRDS normally we say its just Microsoft\nwhereas VDI is usually just about\n\n170\n00:09:25.979 --> 00:09:29.038\neverybody else doing the same\ntype of connection but\n\n171\n00:09:29.038 --> 00:09:33.180\nwe'll see that even inside of RDS\nwe can also do the same thing.\n\n172\n00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.160\nOr we can assign individual\nvirtual machines, and\n\n173\n00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.030\nwe're gonna get into that a little\nbit later on in our show.\n\n174\n00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.190\nBut overall though,\nwe want to begin, right.\n\n175\n00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.900\nSo, let's take from the example\nsomething that we realized.\n\n176\n00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.850\nIs that we are asked, in a scenario\nbasis right, that here's what\n\n177\n00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:52.650\nI want to be able to do but I can't afford\nto spend a lot of money on this solution.\n\n178\n00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:56.130\nBut it's gotta be able to provide\nenough power for my users so\n\n179\n00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.730\nthey can run a piece of software that\nwon't run on their regular desktops.\n\n180\n00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:04.250\nBut I also need to control where I\ndon't allow them to install something\n\n181\n00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:08.470\nonto their own machines that can\ncause anything to kind of go awry.\n\n182\n00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:12.690\nSo I need the control,\nI need that ability to have better power,\n\n183\n00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.040\na better centralized management,\nbe able to lock it down if I choose to.\n\n184\n00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.550\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Redirect where they're saving all\n\n185\n00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.640\nthat stuff.\n\n186\n00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.450\nWell, all that sounds like is,\nyou know, quite a bit to do.\n\n187\n00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.130\nBut, overall though, by using Thumblive,\n\n188\n00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:30.150\nwhat we're gonna see here in just\na moment, we can actually implement this.\n\n189\n00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.370\nNow, the problem that we have is simple.\n\n190\n00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:36.570\nWhen we do so we really need multiple\ncomponents to make this work okay.\n\n191\n00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.680\nSo for example if you wanted\nto do something like that,\n\n192\n00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.890\nlet's say that I wanted to set this up\nwell I need someway so that when people do\n\n193\n00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:48.870\nconnect in that server their gonna get\na remote desktop connection first.\n\n194\n00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:53.860\nSo we know that individuals will need\nthat but then we need to have something,\n\n195\n00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.290\nanother element behind that that\nallows them to connect in and\n\n196\n00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.010\naccess only what we want them to access.\n\n197\n00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.220\nSo we need that element there too.\n\n198\n00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.770\nWe may also need to provide licensing, so\n\n199\n00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.800\nwe may need another element to\nhelp us to provide licensing.\n\n200\n00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.300\nIf they're connecting in from\ninside my network only or\n\n201\n00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.590\nare they're connecting in\nfrom outside my network?\n\n202\n00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.760\nI may also need another\ncomponent like that as well.\n\n203\n00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.870\nSo that requires us to install quite\na bit of different types of software\n\n204\n00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.850\nto make all that happen.\n\n205\n00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:27.634\nWell, Microsoft understood that because\nin previous editions of trying to do\n\n206\n00:11:27.634 --> 00:11:32.059\nstuff like this, like in Server\n2008 R2 and even Server 2008.\n\n207\n00:11:32.059 --> 00:11:34.821\nYou might have actually had to install\nall these multiple roles to get\n\n208\n00:11:34.821 --> 00:11:38.490\neverything working and to get everything\nmoving the way they wanted to.\n\n209\n00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.770\nIn server 2012 they tried to\nmake it a little bit easier\n\n210\n00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:45.430\nby simply saying we're gonna wrap all of\nthat up into remote desktop services,\n\n211\n00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:50.280\nwhat they used to call terminal services\ninstead and make sure that when you do so\n\n212\n00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.280\nit's kind of a simple wizard for us to\nwalk through and to just get started.\n\n213\n00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.670\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nthe way that we are gonna set this up.\n\n214\n00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:03.160\nAnd what we're gonna do is something that\nMicrosoft says look we don't support.\n\n215\n00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:08.638\nAnd I wanna to bring this up let me see\nif I can find that web page here for\n\n216\n00:12:08.638 --> 00:12:15.280\nus to do so which is, Single server,\nlet me see I thought I had it up here.\n\n217\n00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so let me just see Ronnie,\nare you gonna be,\n\n218\n00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.170\nit says single server deployment but\nin all actuality you do have two\n\n219\n00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:26.160\nphysical machines so it's not like you're\nworking off of one particular server.\n\n220\n00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.210\nBut I think I know where\nyou're going here with this.\n\n221\n00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.380\nA lot of admins in the past,\nin order to save money.\n\n222\n00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:36.010\nIf you look at the licensing for like,\nI think it's the standard edition.\n\n223\n00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:37.510\nI could be wrong here.\n\n224\n00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.180\nYou've got your physical and\nthen your two virtual instances.\n\n225\n00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.080\nSo your possi and your vossi.\n\n226\n00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:47.480\nAnd they would take and\ninstall those virtual machines but the way\n\n227\n00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:53.750\nthat they change the licensing with 2012\nand supposedly those two rules, your\n\n228\n00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:58.310\nmachine should be only running those RDS\nservices and not as the domain controller.\n\n229\n00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.750\nAnd that's what you're gonna show us here?\n\n230\n00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.740\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nI'm gonna show you kind of a diagram.\n\n231\n00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.400\nI was hoping to show a link but\nI couldn't find it exactly right away but\n\n232\n00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.630\nI wanted to show you something.\n\n233\n00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:08.770\nWe're gonna be implementing this idea\nof that single-server deployment.\n\n234\n00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:12.200\nThe key here though, is to understand\nthat Microsoft says we don't support it.\n\n235\n00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.245\nAnd that's what I wanted it to get to.\n\n236\n00:13:14.245 --> 00:13:18.470\nNow you're probably saying well, Microsoft\ndoesn't support it, why are you doing it?\n\n237\n00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:21.490\nBecause this may be your\nonly possible solution.\n\n238\n00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.890\nSo if you go out there and there's a link\nthat you're gonna see in our show notes\n\n239\n00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:25.850\nthat we'll bring you right to it,\n\n240\n00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.230\nI just don't want to bring\nup the show notes right now.\n\n241\n00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.030\nThere's a link right in our show notice\nthat will bring you to exactly what they\n\n242\n00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.350\nsay inside of Microsoft.\n\n243\n00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.640\nIt says look,\nwe don't really support this,\n\n244\n00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.170\nwe're not gonna really ever support this.\n\n245\n00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.160\nBut in a pinch, okay,\nthat's what they say.\n\n246\n00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.990\nIf you chose to,\ncould you run this off of one machine,\n\n247\n00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.440\neverything that you wanted\nto off of one machine?\n\n248\n00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.830\nYes, that's what they're saying but\ngood standard best practices say,\n\n249\n00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.760\nyou don't wanna do this, the reason\nwhy is most of us are gonna be doing\n\n250\n00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.120\nthis inside of a Active Directory\nbased type of network and\n\n251\n00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.670\nyou don't want a remote\ndesktop gateway server okay?\n\n252\n00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.005\nMachine that allows for well, machines\nfrom outside to connect them in would also\n\n253\n00:14:05.005 --> 00:14:08.070\nbe a domain controller at the same time,\nthat's kind of silly.\n\n254\n00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:09.720\nSow they're saying look,\nwe don't really support this.\n\n255\n00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.380\nBut in a pinch if we\nwanted to could you do it?\n\n256\n00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:16.280\nYes but they don't even have any\ndocumentation on doing it that way.\n\n257\n00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.060\nSo instead, our single server deployment's\ngonna end up looking like this here on my\n\n258\n00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.240\nscreen, okay.\n\n259\n00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.340\nSo here's a basic set up of\nthe lab that we're gonna be using.\n\n260\n00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:29.340\nI've just separated off the domain\ncontroller environment instead and\n\n261\n00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.370\nthen also where we're\ngonna be doing most of\n\n262\n00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:37.550\nour configuration right here on\nour remote desktop machine, too.\n\n263\n00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:40.670\nBoth of these are running Server 2012 R2.\n\n264\n00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.890\nAnd then I also have a client to\nhelp us to test out everything to\n\n265\n00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.290\nmake sure that everything is actually\nrunning the way that we want to.\n\n266\n00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.240\nBut that's pretty much it when\nyou start to take a look.\n\n267\n00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.308\nSo they're all connected to\nthe same network to make it easy so\n\n268\n00:14:53.308 --> 00:14:55.087\nthat we can have a proof of concept.\n\n269\n00:14:55.087 --> 00:14:59.394\nAnd this is what I would do, okay,\nso in reality when I first did this,\n\n270\n00:14:59.394 --> 00:15:03.337\nthe first time that I implemented\nthis I did exactly this thing,\n\n271\n00:15:03.337 --> 00:15:08.231\nis I brought up a domain controller to\nimplement an Active Directory network and\n\n272\n00:15:08.231 --> 00:15:12.684\nthen I went ahead and just made a second\nserver here, so I knew that I could\n\n273\n00:15:12.684 --> 00:15:16.910\npractice and make sure that RDS was\nworking the way that I want it to.\n\n274\n00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.550\nOkay, that was pretty much it.\n\n275\n00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:22.210\nAnd this is a proof of concept that\nyou want to be able to get past\n\n276\n00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:26.180\nbefore simply going, yeah, just go and\norder me this, this and this machine here.\n\n277\n00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:31.900\nBecause that was part of the deal in that\ncontract was to figure out not only like,\n\n278\n00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.170\nhey, can you get this going and\ncan it work the way that I want it to?\n\n279\n00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:37.870\nThis is actually the environment\nthat I use to figure out and\n\n280\n00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.900\nthen to show the customer,\nlike is this what we really need?\n\n281\n00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:46.150\nSo are you happy if they log in and\nthis is what they're gonna experience?\n\n282\n00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.810\nIs this everything that's happening here?\n\n283\n00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:50.885\nSo you want to make sure you set something\nlike this up before you try it inside of\n\n284\n00:15:50.885 --> 00:15:52.014\na production environment.\n\n285\n00:15:52.014 --> 00:15:53.630\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nthat's what I was going to ask, Ronnie.\n\n286\n00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.641\nSo if we had some box\nAre servers laying around?\n\n287\n00:15:56.641 --> 00:15:58.530\nI mean,\nwho doesn't have servers laying around?\n\n288\n00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:03.320\nThen we could go to Microsoft's site,\ndownload from their, what is it?\n\n289\n00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.950\nThe Tech Eval site.\n\n290\n00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:07.810\nAnd then just run that\ntrial here to make sure\n\n291\n00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:11.146\nthat the solution is gonna work before we-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just specifying something like\n\n292\n00:16:11.146 --> 00:16:14.760\nthat, what you just said there, you don't\nactually even necessarily need a server.\n\n293\n00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.480\nNow I use two different\nphysical machines because\n\n294\n00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.730\nI knew that we'd be\ndoing physical machines.\n\n295\n00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:24.930\nBut Microsoft and\n2012 supports remote desktop environment\n\n296\n00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:28.500\nwhere you're also doing\nthe virtualization support as well.\n\n297\n00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.451\nSo that means that you instead can say,\nhey, I wanna run Hyper V-\n\n298\n00:16:31.451 --> 00:16:32.055\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n299\n00:16:32.055 --> 00:16:33.413\n&gt;&gt; And run my RDS within it.\n\n300\n00:16:33.413 --> 00:16:37.908\nSo you at least have one machine You can\ngo ahead and install Windows server 2012,\n\n301\n00:16:37.908 --> 00:16:40.476\nturn on Hyper-V and\nthen create two BMs inside.\n\n302\n00:16:40.476 --> 00:16:41.881\n&gt;&gt; On those virtual machines, yep.\n\n303\n00:16:41.881 --> 00:16:45.216\n&gt;&gt; Which is it's really a great\nenvironment, and the reason why it's\n\n304\n00:16:45.216 --> 00:16:48.843\nactually great environment as long as\nyou have a host on the outside here,\n\n305\n00:16:48.843 --> 00:16:52.002\nis because of the way that the basic\nlicensing for R12 works for\n\n306\n00:16:52.002 --> 00:16:54.840\nsomething like this in a test environment.\n\n307\n00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.830\nYou need a license, which if you install\nthat for your virtual host machine,\n\n308\n00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.200\nthat's fine, that's great.\n\n309\n00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.520\nBut overall though,\n\n310\n00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.750\nonce you get that, they also normally\ninclude two licenses for virtual machines.\n\n311\n00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:09.360\nSo that's why something that\nreally is a good fit for\n\n312\n00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.420\na lab environment if you\nchose to do something, okay?\n\n313\n00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.840\nBut this is what you want.\n\n314\n00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.050\nYou wanna be able to set this up as\na proof of concept instead of just going,\n\n315\n00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.000\nwell, I implement it,\nI don't know why it's not working.\n\n316\n00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.050\nThat's not really a great place to be.\n\n317\n00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.310\nBut if you already have a domain\ncontroller up and running and\n\n318\n00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:27.280\nyou just wanna try it, you can still do it\nthat way, but just remember that you may\n\n319\n00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.140\nexperience some unusual difficulties\nat times when this is happening.\n\n320\n00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.580\nAll right, so let's go ahead and\nget this thing set up here\n\n321\n00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.940\nas a single server deployment, even\nthough we're actually using two servers.\n\n322\n00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.280\nI know it's ironic-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know,\n\n323\n00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.170\nthe name kinda throws you off there.\n\n324\n00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.760\nBut like Ronnie said,\nit's called a single server deployment,\n\n325\n00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.370\nalthough we're dealing\nwith two servers here.\n\n326\n00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:45.010\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n327\n00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.140\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\nswitch on over and we'll start here and\n\n328\n00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.380\nshow you how quick it is\nto get this up and running.\n\n329\n00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.630\nNow, I'm gonna do something that\nhopefully you might have seen before,\n\n330\n00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:55.010\nyou might not have seen before.\n\n331\n00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:58.230\nBut I am now on my domain controller.\n\n332\n00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.680\nAnd I'm simply going to log in.\n\n333\n00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.030\nI've already been logged in here.\n\n334\n00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.670\nBecause the way that we can configure\nit is that we don't have to go out and\n\n335\n00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:08.150\nfind that server.\n\n336\n00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:12.700\nIf I have multiple 2012 servers, or\nactually any servers that I want to come\n\n337\n00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:18.350\nup here, I instead can actually use\njust this server manager itself.\n\n338\n00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:22.420\nAll I have to do is click on All Servers\nover here on the left hand side and\n\n339\n00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:26.900\nnotice how it shows where I only\nhave one server managed here,\n\n340\n00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.750\nI can simply click on Manage and\nthen Add Server.\n\n341\n00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.310\nWhen I do so, I can select find now.\n\n342\n00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:37.030\nAnd now you'll see both\nof the servers appear.\n\n343\n00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:39.370\nOnce I do that,\nI'm gonna add both of them back in,\n\n344\n00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:42.940\neven though I know the DC01's\nalways over there.\n\n345\n00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.910\nI always forget whether or not it takes\naway something if I don't do that so\n\n346\n00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.470\nI'm just gonna add them both in.\n\n347\n00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:52.390\nAnd now this will give me access to\nthat second server for deployment.\n\n348\n00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:55.190\nSo it's very neat that I don't\nhave to keep switching back and\n\n349\n00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.825\nforth between, cuz this is what you'd\nend up seeing me try to do, right?\n\n350\n00:18:58.825 --> 00:19:02.080\nIs, I'd install it here, and then I'd come\nover to this machine and install it, and\n\n351\n00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.570\nthen flip back over here.\n\n352\n00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.610\nBut by simply doing this where\nI add in all the servers,\n\n353\n00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.664\nI can simply start doing my\ndeployment services here.\n\n354\n00:19:09.664 --> 00:19:13.550\nSo if I click on the Dashboard inside\nof the Server Manager on my domain\n\n355\n00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:17.168\ncontroller, now I can use the big\nlink right here in the middle,\n\n356\n00:19:17.168 --> 00:19:20.920\nI don't always have to do it here,\nbut this is kind of quick for us,\n\n357\n00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:25.074\nand then select Add Roles and Features,\nand it's here in the Add Roles and\n\n358\n00:19:25.074 --> 00:19:27.648\nFeatures that I want to\nfollow this through.\n\n359\n00:19:27.648 --> 00:19:29.340\nI'm gonna click next and\n\n360\n00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:33.300\nnow notice here's the two options\nis this where we get confused.\n\n361\n00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.940\nCan I choose the first one and still\nget remote desktop services installed?\n\n362\n00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.440\nYes, it will bring you to the same menus\n\n363\n00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.460\nthat you seen before where you\ncan check it and do all that.\n\n364\n00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.490\nBut if you're kind of saying, I know I'm\ngoing to be setting this up, I'm going to\n\n365\n00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:51.300\nselect the second option which says remote\ndesktop services installation here.\n\n366\n00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:56.495\nAnd there it is, required for the VDI\nto create the virtual machine-based or\n\n367\n00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:58.920\nsession-based types of desktop deployment.\n\n368\n00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:04.690\nI'm gonna click Next, and\nnow here's the two options, okay?\n\n369\n00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:05.780\nStandard deployment,\n\n370\n00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:09.540\nthat's the one that we're going to\nchoose in a later episode, okay?\n\n371\n00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.900\nAnd the reason why is that\nyou have more granularity and\n\n372\n00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:15.720\ncontrol over where you\nassign the roles to be.\n\n373\n00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.010\nIn the Quick Start,\nbecause we've added in two servers,\n\n374\n00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:20.340\nwe'll get a little bit\nof granularity there.\n\n375\n00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.250\nBut overall though, if it said,\nlook you've only got one machine,\n\n376\n00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.350\nI'll install everything on this one\nmachine and we'll be up and going,\n\n377\n00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.110\nwe're perfectly fine with it.\n\n378\n00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.680\nSo here I'm gonna choose the Quick Start\nbecause it allows you to deploy\n\n379\n00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.320\nRemote Desktop Services on, even though\nthey don't say it they don't like it,\n\n380\n00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.690\none server, okay.\n\n381\n00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.290\nSo they're saying, look,\n\n382\n00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:44.280\nwe don't support it but we recognize\nthe fact that you may try to do this.\n\n383\n00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:50.610\nSo they don't like it, but that's what\ntheir documentation online seems to say.\n\n384\n00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.560\nHere you'll have a couple of options too.\n\n385\n00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:57.420\nHow do you choose to connect in to get\nthings done the way that we want to?\n\n386\n00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.300\nNow this is where it becomes\na little bit tricky.\n\n387\n00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:03.030\nEverybody's always trying to figure\nout which one of these we should do.\n\n388\n00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:07.155\nSo here, it says, hey, configured to allow\nusers to connect to virtual desktops,\n\n389\n00:21:07.155 --> 00:21:10.110\nRemoteApp programs,\nsession-based desktops.\n\n390\n00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.746\nThe key here is to understand\nthe difference between this\n\n391\n00:21:13.746 --> 00:21:17.810\nvirtual desktop and\na session-based desktop as well.\n\n392\n00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:19.420\nAll right, Cherokee.\n\n393\n00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.858\nIf you were to choose,\nwhich one would you normally choose?\n\n394\n00:21:21.858 --> 00:21:22.830\n&gt;&gt; Session-based.\n\n395\n00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:23.840\n&gt;&gt; Okay, why?\n\n396\n00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:28.894\n&gt;&gt; Because of the fact that we spoke about\nearlier, with the VDI being individual\n\n397\n00:21:28.894 --> 00:21:33.643\nvirtual machines, versus just\nconnecting and establishing a session,\n\n398\n00:21:33.643 --> 00:21:39.660\nbecause if you think about that terminal\nlistening, they're listening on port 3389.\n\n399\n00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:44.090\nFor that remote connection and then they\ngo ahead and build up a couple different\n\n400\n00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:49.400\nsessions including one that calls upon the\ngraphics technologies that you can send\n\n401\n00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.720\nthrough that graphical session back and\nforth, if I can talk here.\n\n402\n00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.410\n&gt;&gt; And in a lab environment, when you\ndon't have a lot of resource like I do,\n\n403\n00:21:57.410 --> 00:21:59.020\ncuz I'm running everything\non the laptop here.\n\n404\n00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.660\nIt's probably not gonna be great to\nactually try and bring up a bunch of\n\n405\n00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.120\nvirtual machines in the background without\nme knowing what is gonna happen too.\n\n406\n00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.940\nBut, I'm gonna chose\nthe session-based deployment.\n\n407\n00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.117\nIt says, here it is, it allows you to\nconnect to session collections and\n\n408\n00:22:11.117 --> 00:22:13.660\nthat is something we're going\nto talk about later on.\n\n409\n00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.500\nIs gonna create it for us which is neat.\n\n410\n00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.480\nSo this is kinda like a couple of\nStep Wizard and bam, it's done and\n\n411\n00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.170\nyou're often going which is really nice.\n\n412\n00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:24.730\nBut it doesn't mean that we understand\neverything, and that's why it's gonna get\n\n413\n00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:29.160\na little bit more complicated because, as\nmuch as this is a nice little formula for\n\n414\n00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.180\nus to be able to do, it doesn't do\neverything that we need it to do in a real\n\n415\n00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.050\nworld environment, but at least\nit'll give us the proof of concept.\n\n416\n00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:39.480\nThe Quick Start will\ninstall these three roles.\n\n417\n00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.720\nWe need a Connection Broker,\nthe Connection Broker says,\n\n418\n00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.240\nhey, you're connecting in,\ndo you want a RemoteApp?\n\n419\n00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.690\nDo you wanna connect to\na session-based remote desktop?\n\n420\n00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.570\nHow am I gonna direct you?\n\n421\n00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.950\nThat's what gives us the ability to do.\n\n422\n00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.810\nThe RD Web Access is\nexactly like it sounds.\n\n423\n00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:01.350\nI launch up a web page, and I now I get to\nchoose which one of these that I want to\n\n424\n00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:05.300\ndo and that is what will connect\nus to that Connection Broker.\n\n425\n00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.870\nThe Session Host role and\nthis is important too.\n\n426\n00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:13.010\nThis is where the collection is,\nthis is where we configure\n\n427\n00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:17.620\nall the stuff that we want to allow for\nthat remote user to be able to access.\n\n428\n00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:22.660\nSo, those are the three primary roles\nthat has to be on a machine for\n\n429\n00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.640\nus to run and get this done.\n\n430\n00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.020\nSo, now it's asking,\nwhich of these two servers,\n\n431\n00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:30.430\nRonnie, do you really want it to be on?\n\n432\n00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:33.700\nWell, I don't want it to be on\nthis domain controller, so,\n\n433\n00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.590\nI'm simply gonna remove that one.\n\n434\n00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:37.790\nI am gonna select the RD01.\n\n435\n00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.730\nAnd now, once I do that, it's going\nto begin the installation on RD01\n\n436\n00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:49.230\nof those roles and this is very important.\n\n437\n00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:52.636\nNotice I am still not switched\noff of my domain controller,\n\n438\n00:23:52.636 --> 00:23:57.073\nI'm doing this all through the server\nmanager which allows me to connect in.\n\n439\n00:23:57.073 --> 00:24:00.033\nThe only thing that you have to remember\nhere is notice that it's grayed out here\n\n440\n00:24:00.033 --> 00:24:00.792\ndown at the bottom.\n\n441\n00:24:00.792 --> 00:24:02.090\nLooks a little bit tricky, right?\n\n442\n00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:02.890\nBut it's not.\n\n443\n00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:06.433\nIt's not that we missed anything,\nit's just saying look,\n\n444\n00:24:06.433 --> 00:24:10.957\nrestart if it's actually required here,\nand then the word Deploy appears.\n\n445\n00:24:10.957 --> 00:24:14.384\nSo I'm gonna click on Deploy and\nfrom here, we'll just wait for\n\n446\n00:24:14.384 --> 00:24:18.080\nit to go ahead and install and\ndo the rolls that it needs to.\n\n447\n00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:23.080\nSo this is now reaching out across\nthe network from my DC01, getting those\n\n448\n00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:29.210\ncommands and\nnow running them over on RD01 as well.\n\n449\n00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:33.050\nAnd now, those three roles\nwill actually be installed.\n\n450\n00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:38.720\nOnce they're installed, we're really not\nfar from getting it up and running, okay?\n\n451\n00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.770\nReally, at the very basic,\nonce everything is actually installed, we\n\n452\n00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:47.080\ncan kind of do a very simple test to prove\nthat we're actually connected here and\n\n453\n00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.130\nmake sure that everything is going on.\n\n454\n00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:53.640\nBut that's really about how quick it is\nif you use that quick setup deployment\n\n455\n00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.730\nto make sure that everything is going on.\n\n456\n00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.750\nBut that doesn't mean that everything is\ngonna be done the way that we need to.\n\n457\n00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.370\nAnd that's what we find out, right.\n\n458\n00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:03.190\nIn a real world environment it'd\nbe nice if we could just say done.\n\n459\n00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:05.240\nAnd then you walk away from the customer.\n\n460\n00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.990\nAnd they're perfectly happy with it.\n\n461\n00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:10.056\nIt's always a, but what if I need this?\n\n462\n00:25:10.056 --> 00:25:11.520\nWhat if I want to do this?\n\n463\n00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.100\nWhat if we do that?\n\n464\n00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.995\nWell, that's when you start realizing that\nif you do this in a real environment,\n\n465\n00:25:16.995 --> 00:25:19.817\nright in a production environment,\nyou're going to end up\n\n466\n00:25:19.817 --> 00:25:23.148\nchoosing that standard deployment\ninstead and walk through those and\n\n467\n00:25:23.148 --> 00:25:26.310\nthen you'll actually be able to\nkind of control the way that things\n\n468\n00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:30.430\nare actually gonna be a little bit\nbetter in terms of their installation.\n\n469\n00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:34.410\nSo here we'll just kind of\ndo a couple of things once\n\n470\n00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:37.720\neverything is actually finished here,\nis just to take a moment or two for\n\n471\n00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.850\nus to finish this installation\napart when it does everything.\n\n472\n00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.820\nSo let's make sure that we\nunderstand what we've done so\n\n473\n00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.500\nfar in this single server deployment,\nokay?\n\n474\n00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:51.640\nRemember that, right away, we can install\nthis on a domain controller we choose to,\n\n475\n00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.160\nand Microsoft says, you can do it,\nbut we don't recommend it, and\n\n476\n00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.590\nwe probably won't support it.\n\n477\n00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.030\nSo, don't call us for\nhelp if you trying to do this.\n\n478\n00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.410\nIt's not a good thing.\n\n479\n00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:03.090\nWell, so then just showed you\nwalking through the Wizard and\n\n480\n00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.470\nchoosing those options.\n\n481\n00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:08.160\nGo back make sure you read up on some of\nthose option if you're not sure exactly\n\n482\n00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:12.950\nwhich one but in my lab in Burma I\nchose as session host in Burma instead\n\n483\n00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:17.160\nan a virtual desktop connection\nthat we want here too, okay.\n\n484\n00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.990\nSo what you're actually seeing is it is\nrestarting some of these services here.\n\n485\n00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:25.760\nAnd that's just gonna take a moment\nbefore we actually get through everything\n\n486\n00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.100\nis what we're gonna end up seeing here,\nokay?\n\n487\n00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:33.380\nNow, I want to talk about, since we've\ngot time at this particular point here.\n\n488\n00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.710\nCouple of other things that\nnormally need to be installed\n\n489\n00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:38.260\nonce everything is done, right?\n\n490\n00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:42.910\nSo here we have the remote\ndesktop services role,\n\n491\n00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:46.130\nitself, the session host and\nthe remote apps program.\n\n492\n00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:50.640\nBut you'll also see that later on you need\na what we call a remote desktop gateway.\n\n493\n00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.070\nAs well as a licensing server and\n\n494\n00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:58.010\nif we're going to end up virtualizing\nthis we also need what we call the remote\n\n495\n00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:01.840\ndesktop virtualization role\ninstalled as well okay.\n\n496\n00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.558\nRight, so let's take a look\nat my machine just quickly,\n\n497\n00:27:05.558 --> 00:27:07.733\nand now we'll see it did finish.\n\n498\n00:27:07.733 --> 00:27:11.330\nThe first role, once it actually\ninstalled I had to reboot.\n\n499\n00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:15.470\nThese other two roles while I was taking,\nit finished up in the last ten seconds or\n\n500\n00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:17.870\nso as I was talking.\n\n501\n00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:21.280\nNow, notice here Cherokee,\nright away at the bottom.\n\n502\n00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:26.870\nI get this nice little link that says hey,\nremote desktop.\n\n503\n00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:31.080\nAnd it says this is he connect to\nthe remote desktop Host here and\n\n504\n00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.530\nwe should be ready to go if everything is\ndone and good in the way that we want to.\n\n505\n00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:40.320\nSo let's now go ahead and\nsee what we can do here.\n\n506\n00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:46.030\nSo here I'm going to switch\non over to my test machine.\n\n507\n00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:50.660\nI'm running just Windows PC or\nThin PC it's just as an example cuz I\n\n508\n00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:54.750\nchose not to do anything\nfuller at this point.\n\n509\n00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:59.583\nThen I can open up the Internet Explorer\nhere or just a moment.\n\n510\n00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:06.121\nAnd then try to connect directly in\n\n511\n00:28:11.917 --> 00:28:15.720\nThe key part here is to\nremember the entire URL.\n\n512\n00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:19.240\nSo this is kinda the hard\nthing at the beginning.\n\n513\n00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.210\nRemember that you have to\nadd this in at the end.\n\n514\n00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:24.290\nThere were a couple of times where I\nforgot it when I was testing this out.\n\n515\n00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:25.970\nLike this is not working.\n\n516\n00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.800\nAnd then I was like,\nI forgot this RD web at the end.\n\n517\n00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.710\nOnce that actually worked,\neverything was fine.\n\n518\n00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.230\nSo now let's see as we can connect in.\n\n519\n00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:37.890\nIf we can connect in, then everything is\nworking the way that I said it should be.\n\n520\n00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:39.550\nAnd we should be able to just connect in.\n\n521\n00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:42.720\nNow, if it's not, then that means there's\nother issues that have to be done.\n\n522\n00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.660\nAnd that shows you something, right.\n\n523\n00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.410\nThat even though we walked through\nthe Wizard and everything was successful,\n\n524\n00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:51.730\nokay, it didn't finish everything and\nthat's why we have to go on.\n\n525\n00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:52.410\nOkay?\n\n526\n00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:55.410\nSo here's your first sign\nthat it was successful.\n\n527\n00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:57.190\nWe're giving a certificate,\n\n528\n00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:00.890\nokay, but we don't exactly know where it's\nfrom but I know where it's from because\n\n529\n00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:03.500\nit's the only machine that's connected\nto this network at this point.\n\n530\n00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.399\nI'm going to continue to this website.\n\n531\n00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:12.370\nAnd there it is, we now know at least\none of those roles has actually worked,\n\n532\n00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:17.390\nthe RD web access role is working at\nthis particular point in time and\n\n533\n00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:19.060\nthat we are good with it.\n\n534\n00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:26.187\nThe other thing that I can do as\na domain member is to connect right in\n\n535\n00:29:29.389 --> 00:29:32.251\nAnd then click Sign in if\nI typed in everything, and\n\n536\n00:29:32.251 --> 00:29:35.810\nnow you'll see the default\ninstallation here, okay?\n\n537\n00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:39.664\nSo right at the beginning,\nif I wanted to do this remote desktop,\n\n538\n00:29:39.664 --> 00:29:43.040\nI'm running on an older machine,\nthis Windows Thin PC.\n\n539\n00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:43.920\nIt hasn't been updated.\n\n540\n00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:48.240\nIt's not Is not anything that's\nspectacular it's not super is designed for\n\n541\n00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:53.560\nsuper powerful machine but I am now able\nto get access to certain things, right?\n\n542\n00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.800\nThese particular application now\nthis is the default application here\n\n543\n00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.230\nit doesn't really require much for\nus to do anything.\n\n544\n00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:00.270\nWhen I click on this,\n\n545\n00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:05.385\nnotice it brings me up to\nthe connection here for the remote app.\n\n546\n00:30:05.385 --> 00:30:10.900\nAnd now, I can connect in and use that\napplication if I choose to do that.\n\n547\n00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:14.320\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie, we can customize this and\nadd different applications that maybe\n\n548\n00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:19.220\nin a kind of line of business type of\napplications for my environment here.\n\n549\n00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.060\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that's what you wanna do, right?\n\n550\n00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:24.182\nSo even though that\nquick start helps us It\n\n551\n00:30:24.182 --> 00:30:27.939\ndoes kind of give us at\nleast a default set, okay?\n\n552\n00:30:27.939 --> 00:30:30.783\nBut we wanna be able to modify this,\nwanna build changes, and\n\n553\n00:30:30.783 --> 00:30:34.229\nthere is also other options that we have\nhave in mind that we have to be able to\n\n554\n00:30:34.229 --> 00:30:35.932\npay attention to as well.\n\n555\n00:30:35.932 --> 00:30:39.550\nNotice Cherokee right up\nhere at the top too okay.\n\n556\n00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:43.859\nSame thing weird about the way\nthat this is showing up here.\n\n557\n00:30:43.859 --> 00:30:45.100\nThe certificate error?\n\n558\n00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.705\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the certificate error, okay.\n\n559\n00:30:46.705 --> 00:30:48.030\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which shows us now,\n\n560\n00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:52.330\nits not that it can't be secured but there\nis actually an error on this certificate\n\n561\n00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:54.820\nand that's because its using\na self signed certificate.\n\n562\n00:30:54.820 --> 00:31:01.060\nSo the RD1 if I take a look at it just,\nwell maybe, let's see.\n\n563\n00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.020\nDid I click on the wrong thing?\n\n564\n00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.420\nIt's just taking its sweet time because\nit's running on this Thin PC, but\n\n565\n00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.000\nif I click on it, it actually shows\nthat it's been signed by itself.\n\n566\n00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.810\nSo it's a self-signed certificate.\n\n567\n00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:12.770\nAnd it looks like it's just\nhaving a hard time connecting.\n\n568\n00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:15.920\nSo that's how slow this\nmachine was in the beginning.\n\n569\n00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.780\nSo there it goes.\n\n570\n00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:21.850\nYou can see now where it says, hey,\nit was issued to RD01 by myself.\n\n571\n00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:24.810\nWell that's saying this is.\n\n572\n00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:27.220\nCan you use it inside\nof a regular network?\n\n573\n00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.980\nProbably and you'd probably never\nhave any issues with it at all.\n\n574\n00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.640\nIf I were connecting\nthem from the outside,\n\n575\n00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.100\nthis is probably not something I want.\n\n576\n00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.230\nIt wouldn't be considered secure at all.\n\n577\n00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:40.640\nSo there's a lot more for us to do,\njust getting started is at least the key.\n\n578\n00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.780\nBut notice it really didn't\ntake a lot of extra work.\n\n579\n00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:47.110\nBut now we need to go in and we now\nneed to put in that scenario of where\n\n580\n00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:50.340\nthe customer says,\nhey this is what I really need instead.\n\n581\n00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:53.420\nAnd that way we'll start seeing\nhow we can start modifying\n\n582\n00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.530\njust the connections that we've done so\nfar.\n\n583\n00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:58.535\nBut we need to save that for another\nshow cuz I've ran out of time so far.\n\n584\n00:31:58.535 --> 00:32:01.665\n&gt;&gt; We do have a lot left to configure but\nthank you so much for joining us today.\n\n585\n00:32:01.665 --> 00:32:04.685\nAt least to get it started and\nsetting up our RDS servers.\n\n586\n00:32:04.685 --> 00:32:06.175\nAnd thank you ladies and gentlemen for\n\n587\n00:32:06.175 --> 00:32:09.635\nwatching but stay tuned we have\nmore information headed your way.\n\n588\n00:32:09.635 --> 00:32:11.375\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this episode.\n\n589\n00:32:11.375 --> 00:32:12.296\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n590\n00:32:12.296 --> 00:32:16.037\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at

00:00:08.327\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.327 --> 00:00:11.882\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:14.593\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nRemote Desktop Services series.\n\n6\n00:00:14.593 --> 00:00:17.060\nI'm your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.210\nIn the previous episode,\n\n8\n00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.020\nwe looked at how to install RDS and\nget that initially set up.\n\n9\n00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.360\nBut we do need to go on and\ncontinue with additional configurations.\n\n10\n00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.370\nSo in this show, we're specifically\ngoing to be looking at how to modify and\n\n11\n00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.470\nconfigure our session collections.\n\n12\n00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.950\nWith us today we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong in studios.\n\n13\n00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.344\nThank you for joining us today Ronnie.\n\n14\n00:00:37.344 --> 00:00:38.337\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\n\n15\n00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:42.206\nhaving me back as we continue on taking\na look at more Remote Desktop Services.\n\n16\n00:00:42.206 --> 00:00:47.230\nAnd this one is more of the customization\nthat ends up happening, right?\n\n17\n00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.340\nGetting Remote Desktop Services setup just\nquick and easy, the way that we did it, is\n\n18\n00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.170\nsomething that really it doesn't take much\nfor us to do and we can get it working.\n\n19\n00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.060\nBut even with just that regular\ndefault and it's done, now\n\n20\n00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.830\nwe have to begin to install in those line\nof business applications that people need.\n\n21\n00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.670\nWe have to be able to make\nit work where the customer\n\n22\n00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.760\nneeds it to work in that sense.\n\n23\n00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.522\nSo that's what we want to talk about is\nhow do we make sure that the customers\n\n24\n00:01:15.522 --> 00:01:18.704\nare getting what they really\nare desiring to have on their end.\n\n25\n00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:21.430\nAnd making sure it works\nthe way that they want it to.\n\n26\n00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.060\nWell, that begins of course\nwith the idea here of\n\n27\n00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.570\ntaking a look at what we call the host or\nthe session collections.\n\n28\n00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.360\nI want to say host sessions but session\ncollections, I don't know why, it didn't\n\n29\n00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.380\nsound right in my mind when I said\nthat's what we're gonna take a look at.\n\n30\n00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.470\nWe wanna be able to modify it.\n\n31\n00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.489\nWe already showed you the default where it\nkind of give you like Paint and WordPad,\n\n32\n00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:41.548\nand the calculator.\n\n33\n00:01:41.548 --> 00:01:47.210\nWhich of course are cool tools and\nreally valuable and usable.\n\n34\n00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.470\nI should say they're at least utilitarian,\nright?\n\n35\n00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.520\nThey will work but\n\n36\n00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.960\nthat's not normally what we want to\npublish out there for everybody, okay?\n\n37\n00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.120\nAnd there's a reason for it because on\ntheir machines they're already running\n\n38\n00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.228\ncalculator, and Paint, and probably\nWordPad's already on their machine.\n\n39\n00:02:05.228 --> 00:02:07.039\nSo that's not what they normally need.\n\n40\n00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.879\nAnd so what we normally need\nto do is publish things that\n\n41\n00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.294\nthey really need which might not\nbe installed on their machines.\n\n42\n00:02:13.294 --> 00:02:17.363\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie, we're not gonna be taking\na look at anything App-V or any kind of\n\n43\n00:02:17.363 --> 00:02:21.706\nspecific setup where, like, if you go to\na restaurant like Chili's or something.\n\n44\n00:02:21.706 --> 00:02:25.726\nAnd you have those servers connecting into\none specific application to input your\n\n45\n00:02:25.726 --> 00:02:27.130\nfood and drink orders.\n\n46\n00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.180\nWe're really talking about that one\noperating system and then sharing out\n\n47\n00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.300\nany kind of apps that would be installed\non top of the operating system, right?\n\n48\n00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's pretty much the idea here.\n\n49\n00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.330\nThe very fact is,\n\n50\n00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.710\nremember that applications\nare getting larger and larger.\n\n51\n00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.030\nThey're requiring more and more\nresources to be able to run on machines.\n\n52\n00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.410\nAnd the problem that we have with\nthe desktop world is whether or\n\n53\n00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.620\nnot those desktop machines are keeping up\nwith that ability to run some of these.\n\n54\n00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.800\nSo we might see that and\n\n55\n00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.810\nwe might see that we don't have\nthe functionality that we need to.\n\n56\n00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.840\nAnd this can be very disconcerting for\nall of us as we start to do this.\n\n57\n00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.040\nI think when I first started installing\nsomething like Microsoft Office, okay,\n\n58\n00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.320\nthe key was to get everybody up to\nthe latest edition of Microsoft Office.\n\n59\n00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.950\nAnd you might be wondering, well, why?\n\n60\n00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.230\nBecause at that point, it was 2010 or 11,\nI can't remember exactly what year it was.\n\n61\n00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.392\nBut the office was still running 2007,\nokay?\n\n62\n00:03:20.392 --> 00:03:21.870\nSo there was at least one version.\n\n63\n00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.990\nI said, no,\nwe need to bump up to the latest.\n\n64\n00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.870\nActually it was later than that,\nit was 2013.\n\n65\n00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.100\nI'm trying to remember all the things cuz-\n&gt;&gt; It can get fuzzy.\n\n66\n00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does get fuzzy.\n\n67\n00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.980\nAll that history stuff\nkinda blends together.\n\n68\n00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.930\nBut, I do remember it was around 2007, and\nthey're like, no we want to bump up and\n\n69\n00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.840\ndo everything that we needed to.\n\n70\n00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.470\nBut at that point, when we chose to\ndo that, we found out something.\n\n71\n00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.380\nWe couldn't even run that because\nthere was something missing from\n\n72\n00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.120\ntheir CMS client that would\nconnect them into Outlook.\n\n73\n00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.179\nThat they just couldn't run with the\nlatest edition cuz they didn't have any\n\n74\n00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:53.314\nconnector that would actually\nallow them to do that.\n\n75\n00:03:53.314 --> 00:03:55.627\nSo had to bump it back down to 2010 for\n\n76\n00:03:55.627 --> 00:03:59.070\nthe version of Office\nthat they chose to run.\n\n77\n00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.440\nSo you will run into instances like that\nwhere you go, okay, this is perfect,\n\n78\n00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.630\neverybody's updated.\n\n79\n00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.280\nAnd then you go, but it doesn't connect to\neverything that we need it to connect to.\n\n80\n00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.460\nAnd now you have to modify and\nyou have to change that.\n\n81\n00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.270\nAnd change the way that everything\nis published out there,\n\n82\n00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.730\nand do what we need it to do, okay?\n\n83\n00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.970\nSo at this point, let's take a look\nat what we've already set up.\n\n84\n00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.880\nAnd then we'll move into the idea of\nmodifying this session collection.\n\n85\n00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.520\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n86\n00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.650\nremember that what we did in\nthat previous episode, right?\n\n87\n00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.395\nIs that we did a quickstart\ntype of installation and\n\n88\n00:04:28.395 --> 00:04:30.060\nhere's what our results are gonna be.\n\n89\n00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.630\nSo let's take a look at my machine and\nthat way we will start here.\n\n90\n00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.800\nSo inside of the server manager I'm\nstill on the domain controller, or\n\n91\n00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.140\nat least I think I am.\n\n92\n00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.580\nYep, I'm still on the domain controller,\nthat's the easiest way for\n\n93\n00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.950\nme to figure that out very quickly.\n\n94\n00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.130\nNow I've added in the role down here.\n\n95\n00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.910\nAnd you can see where it says\nRemote Desktop Services.\n\n96\n00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.200\nIf I click once on that role,\nthat will bring me to the Overview.\n\n97\n00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.370\nNow because this is actually the Overview,\nI can see a couple of different ways, or\n\n98\n00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.100\na couple of different\naspects that I wanted to see.\n\n99\n00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.360\nOver on the right-hand side\nit says Deployment Servers.\n\n100\n00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.550\nNow you can see where the servers are all\nrunning on that one remote server, right?\n\n101\n00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.560\nRD01 is running my connection broker.\n\n102\n00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.280\nIt is running the RD session host,\n\n103\n00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.770\nthat's the one we're gonna\nbe really focusing in on.\n\n104\n00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.730\nAnd of course, the RD Web Access.\n\n105\n00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.390\nThe great thing is, we've proven that\nall of these are now working, right?\n\n106\n00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.870\nBy making that simple connection in, we're\nable to show that everything is working.\n\n107\n00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.160\nThis is the one thing I\nreally don't understand here.\n\n108\n00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.070\nCuz it kinda confused me like\nthe first time that I ran this.\n\n109\n00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.110\nSo notice how, this is the way I always\nthink about whether things are active and\n\n110\n00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.740\nconfigured correctly, right?\n\n111\n00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.972\nThey're kind of bright and\nthey're lit up and they're great.\n\n112\n00:05:41.972 --> 00:05:43.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n113\n00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.240\nhere in the Remote Desktop Services,\n\n114\n00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.540\nin their deployment overview,\nit's just the opposite.\n\n115\n00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.520\nIt's the gray ones that\nare actually active.\n\n116\n00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.992\nIt's not the ones that are-\n&gt;&gt; Green?\n\n117\n00:05:53.992 --> 00:05:54.920\nThat is unusual.\n\n118\n00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the way that they tell you\nis, no, you're not looking at the color,\n\n119\n00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.560\nbut look at the icons.\n\n120\n00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.510\nSo look at Remote Web Access.\n\n121\n00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.240\nNotice how it has the world icon saying,\nyou can access this through the web, okay?\n\n122\n00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.760\nNest Remote, Connection Broker,\nlook at that,\n\n123\n00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.960\nit has a nice little connection for\nyou to make.\n\n124\n00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.160\nThe host session, so notice how each\nicon's different, but look at these two.\n\n125\n00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.090\nKind of the big old\ngeneric green plus sign.\n\n126\n00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.280\nBut I hate to say it, the first couple of\ntimes when I was running this through,\n\n127\n00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.170\nit was like, that's kinda weird.\n\n128\n00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.830\nWhy would they choose to\nmake that kinda bright?\n\n129\n00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.255\nIt's to call your attention\nthat these need to configured,\n\n130\n00:06:30.255 --> 00:06:31.980\nis what they're saying.\n\n131\n00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.597\nSo to me, it would be the ones that\nare grayed out that aren't working,\n\n132\n00:06:35.597 --> 00:06:38.300\nthat you would go,\nlet's pay attention to those.\n\n133\n00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.300\nBut, no in their minds\nthis is the way it works.\n\n134\n00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.194\n&gt;&gt; They're calling it what's\nleft to be configured.\n\n135\n00:06:41.194 --> 00:06:42.790\n&gt;&gt; What's left to be configured.\n\n136\n00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.164\nAnd, I don't know why, but\nto me, that's backward.\n\n137\n00:06:46.164 --> 00:06:47.710\nI know the rest of the world\nis probably saying, no,\n\n138\n00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.150\nRonnie you're the one that's backward,\nand that's fine.\n\n139\n00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.820\nAnd I may be the one that's backward.\n\n140\n00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.380\nOkay, now I didn't have to do\nanything to get Paint, or WordPad, or\n\n141\n00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.170\na calculator to show up.\n\n142\n00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:04.046\nWhen we did that quickstart, it created\nthis quick session collection, okay?\n\n143\n00:07:04.046 --> 00:07:07.801\nAnd you can see it right here\nunderneath Rd session host, okay?\n\n144\n00:07:07.801 --> 00:07:11.180\nNow before we get started here,\nlet's talk about these roles just briefly.\n\n145\n00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.140\nSo that we understand what's going on.\n\n146\n00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.360\nAnd we're gonna be configuring these\na little bit later on in another episode.\n\n147\n00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.334\nCuz we're not really connecting outside,\n\n148\n00:07:18.334 --> 00:07:21.650\nwe're just trying to do a proof of\nconcept that we know what needs to work.\n\n149\n00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.295\nAnd then we'll worry\nabout the connections and\n\n150\n00:07:23.295 --> 00:07:25.670\nall the other stuff a little\nbit later here, okay?\n\n151\n00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.480\nSo, of course, RD Web Access,\n\n152\n00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.940\nthis is what gives us that\nwebpage to be able to connect in.\n\n153\n00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.918\nAnd if we go to another machine and\nwe're able to connect to that page where\n\n154\n00:07:36.918 --> 00:07:41.755\nit gives us a login, we know that\nRD Web Access is up and running, okay?\n\n155\n00:07:41.755 --> 00:07:47.456\nThe RD Connection Broker is what gives\nus that ability to say whether or\n\n156\n00:07:47.456 --> 00:07:51.526\nnot we are going to connect\nto a virtualized host.\n\n157\n00:07:51.526 --> 00:07:55.771\nIf I'm running Hyper-V, this is\nthe service that will be turned on and\n\n158\n00:07:55.771 --> 00:07:56.636\nconfigured.\n\n159\n00:07:56.636 --> 00:08:01.517\nNow, even though I'm not running Hyper-V,\nyou'll actually notice that\n\n160\n00:08:01.517 --> 00:08:06.550\nHey you got this unusual icon here which\nis an i and I'm looking for Hyper-V but\n\n161\n00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:11.294\nit's saying I think, you're virutalized\nbut I'm not doing anything.\n\n162\n00:08:11.294 --> 00:08:14.834\nSo it's not giving me any other\nconfiguration operation here but more than\n\n163\n00:08:14.834 --> 00:08:18.712\nlikely even Hyper-V would probably show up\nwith a different icon at this point and\n\n164\n00:08:18.712 --> 00:08:19.910\nthen of course this one.\n\n165\n00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:24.459\nThis is where all of our managed\napplications are going to be,\n\n166\n00:08:24.459 --> 00:08:28.080\nis right here on the RD session host.\n\n167\n00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.490\nThis is the one that we\nwant to reconfigure,\n\n168\n00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.390\nbecause I don't want the default.\n\n169\n00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.960\nSo now, in our scenario where we talked\nabout the need to do something, right?\n\n170\n00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.106\nHow do I change from the default\nto what I need to configure?\n\n171\n00:08:40.106 --> 00:08:43.650\nOkay well, this is where we go to do this.\n\n172\n00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:48.020\nOver here on the left hand side, notice\nthat once you selected the remote desktop\n\n173\n00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:53.500\nservices and we're now on the overview,\nI can click on servers and\n\n174\n00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.700\nthis is where I have the ability\nto see on both machines.\n\n175\n00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.340\nNow currently I'm just showing RD1 If I\nwant to manage both of them or\n\n176\n00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.590\nmultiples of them, so for example in our\n\n177\n00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.380\nchat room we actually have people that\nhave set this up on multiple servers.\n\n178\n00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:12.600\nI want to make sure that I add in\nall of my servers that are running.\n\n179\n00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.600\nSo I can do all the configuration from\none spot if it gives me that ability to.\n\n180\n00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:22.070\nNow notice I added in RDC or DC1 but\nit didn't take it and the reason\n\n181\n00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:27.010\nwhy is that remote desktop services\nis not actually installed on DC1 yet.\n\n182\n00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:31.500\nOkay, so I don't have anything installed\non DC1 and that's why it didn't take it.\n\n183\n00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.500\nNow I'm gonna click on connections and\n\n184\n00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.190\nhere it gives me a summary of\nthe connections right now.\n\n185\n00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.180\nThis is where we have\nto kind of be careful.\n\n186\n00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:46.090\nTraditionally, and\nthe way that Microsoft has set this up,\n\n187\n00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.940\nis that we can either\nhave a session collection\n\n188\n00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:55.220\nthat essentially gives us remote apps or\nit gives us a desktop, okay?\n\n189\n00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.139\nWe can either do remote apps or\na desktop in a single collection.\n\n190\n00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.000\nYou cannot do both in the same connection.\n\n191\n00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.330\nYou can, okay?\n\n192\n00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.110\nBut you're not supposed to okay?\n\n193\n00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.370\nSo it can be done.\n\n194\n00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.360\nYou just don't normally do it.\n\n195\n00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.280\nSo that may be some experiencing that\nyou're trying to get around, it won't\n\n196\n00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.070\nlet me add in what I want to add in\nwhich is that remote desktop connection.\n\n197\n00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.830\nBut it can be done okay?\n\n198\n00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.950\nSo here on this session collection,\n\n199\n00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.990\nwe're just pretty much told\nwhere it's actually going to be.\n\n200\n00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.620\nThe connections that are actually allowed,\nand\n\n201\n00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.300\nnotice that it's actually\nnot connected at this point.\n\n202\n00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:34.950\nIt does show, behind my head here\njust briefly, see if I can zoom in.\n\n203\n00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.490\nIt says that at this particular point,\n\n204\n00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:43.585\nright, at one point it showed this quick\nconnection, quick session collection.\n\n205\n00:10:43.585 --> 00:10:48.573\nWhere it showed that I as user 01,\nwhich I was logged in the previous episode\n\n206\n00:10:48.573 --> 00:10:53.055\nas user one, on that thin client,\nor thin PC, connected into RD1.\n\n207\n00:10:53.055 --> 00:10:55.800\nBut right now,\nit sees that it's disconnected, okay?\n\n208\n00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.460\nSo, the great thing is we can monitor\na little bit of the information that we\n\n209\n00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.670\nwant right there.\n\n210\n00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.990\nBut we wanna modify the session here.\n\n211\n00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:08.610\nWe select the quick session collection.\n\n212\n00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:09.220\nNow, I know it's hard to say.\n\n213\n00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.483\n&gt;&gt; Sally sells seashores it always comes\nto mind when you've got this mouthful.\n\n214\n00:11:12.483 --> 00:11:13.318\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n215\n00:11:13.318 --> 00:11:16.370\nit's a little bit of a bit\nof a hassle there okay?\n\n216\n00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.820\nIs what we have the ability to do.\n\n217\n00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.140\nSo if you create a collection,\n\n218\n00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.505\nyou're saying here's the apps\nthat I want to be published out.\n\n219\n00:11:22.505 --> 00:11:25.080\nOkay, that's what you're\nessentially saying here, okay?\n\n220\n00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:30.670\nCurrently you can see that there's\none particular user group and\n\n221\n00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.820\nthis can be limited as well.\n\n222\n00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:37.330\nSo if I click on those tasks like edit\nproperties notice that I can come in here\n\n223\n00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.580\nif I choose to,\nto say the user group that I want.\n\n224\n00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.830\nSo inside of your active directory if\nyou go look I don't want every domain\n\n225\n00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.680\nuser to be able to access this.\n\n226\n00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.550\nThere's only gonna be a collection and so\n\n227\n00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:54.391\nyou might do something like remote\nusers or travelling sales people.\n\n228\n00:11:54.391 --> 00:11:59.133\nWhatever it might be or this particular\ndepartment if you want them to only\n\n229\n00:11:59.133 --> 00:12:03.195\nuse that session,\nthat session collection, you can do that.\n\n230\n00:12:03.195 --> 00:12:07.695\nAnd that way you can, you select it but\ndomain users we're gonna leave it but\n\n231\n00:12:07.695 --> 00:12:11.020\nanybody that choose to do that,\nyou can do that as well.\n\n232\n00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:16.593\nAlso, you can say how long\neach sessions lasts as well.\n\n233\n00:12:16.593 --> 00:12:19.737\nSo here it says set,\nlet me see if I can zoom in,\n\n234\n00:12:19.737 --> 00:12:24.590\nSet RD, Session Host, server timeout,\nand reconnection settings.\n\n235\n00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.603\nSo when do I want to disconnect a session?\n\n236\n00:12:27.603 --> 00:12:29.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we can time this if we need to.\n\n237\n00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.952\nSo Cherokee's laughing like this is\nsomething fun to do to somebody.\n\n238\n00:12:33.952 --> 00:12:35.548\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I'm sorry Ronnie.\n\n239\n00:12:35.548 --> 00:12:36.670\nYou know how evil I am.\n\n240\n00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:37.430\nI just saw that and\n\n241\n00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.639\nhow annoying would that be, if you set\nthat to one minute intervals there.\n\n242\n00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:42.735\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that would be pretty annoying.\n\n243\n00:12:42.735 --> 00:12:44.349\nYou're right, that would be pretty.\n\n244\n00:12:44.349 --> 00:12:46.715\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm still not sure why she's chuckling\n\n245\n00:12:46.715 --> 00:12:48.352\nat it like she's actually\ntrying to do that or\n\n246\n00:12:48.352 --> 00:12:50.610\nshe's thinking about how\nto do that right now.\n\n247\n00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.170\nOf course action times and then idle.\n\n248\n00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:56.060\nIdle is probably the biggest\none that we worry about, right?\n\n249\n00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.950\nWe don't want people just\nconnecting in all day long.\n\n250\n00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:03.100\nBut we don't wanna just\narbitrarily disconnect them.\n\n251\n00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.593\nBut if their using the machine\nyes let them stay connected but\n\n252\n00:13:06.593 --> 00:13:09.274\ngive them a time out about\nhow long it might be.\n\n253\n00:13:09.274 --> 00:13:12.761\nYou might choose something like that\ninstead yeah that one seemed to\n\n254\n00:13:12.761 --> 00:13:14.596\nmake a little more logical sense and\n\n255\n00:13:14.596 --> 00:13:17.975\ndon't do it like Cherokee laugh at\nit when you go haha watch this.\n\n256\n00:13:17.975 --> 00:13:21.177\nDon't do that kind of thing okay but\njust realize that you have\n\n257\n00:13:21.177 --> 00:13:25.630\na lot of these options here top that are\nopen and available, here's load balancing.\n\n258\n00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.060\nWe haven't set up any load balancing, so\nwe're not so worried about it right now.\n\n259\n00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.150\nWe're gonna do some of that\na little bit later on.\n\n260\n00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.660\nAnd here are the client settings.\n\n261\n00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:37.700\nNow we had a question about this in the\nchat a little bit earlier as well, okay?\n\n262\n00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.040\nNotice these client settings.\n\n263\n00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.933\nThis is for the remote desktop\nconnection that we're doing.\n\n264\n00:13:41.933 --> 00:13:44.960\nYou know what, let me make sure,\nlet me see if I can bring that back up.\n\n265\n00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.501\nHere very quickly.\n\n266\n00:13:47.501 --> 00:13:49.240\nSo that way we can see it.\n\n267\n00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.090\nWell I say quickly.\n\n268\n00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:56.380\nThat's relative within my PC client here.\n\n269\n00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:02.454\nEasier one, itprotvdemo.com/rdeweb\n\n270\n00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:08.340\nSee if everything I\nspelled here is correct.\n\n271\n00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:13.573\nWe should be able to connect in soon,\nor did I bring something down?\n\n272\n00:14:13.573 --> 00:14:15.990\nLet's see,\nit's just taking its sweet time, okay?\n\n273\n00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:19.163\nSo we'll go on with that for a moment,\nand then we'll come back and\n\n274\n00:14:19.163 --> 00:14:21.102\nhopefully show where all this stuff is.\n\n275\n00:14:21.102 --> 00:14:23.780\nSo the way that this is done, right?\n\n276\n00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.390\nIs that when we normally click\non like I did on Wordpad,\n\n277\n00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.380\nwhich I didn't do in the last episode.\n\n278\n00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.670\nSo I probably did that\nduring the break and\n\n279\n00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:33.060\nthat's probably why you're like,\nhe didn't do anything.\n\n280\n00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.250\nHe just kinda showed that it was up and\nrunning.\n\n281\n00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:40.797\nBut this is where we can configure that\nclient setting to enable redirection for\n\n282\n00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:42.800\nthe following things here.\n\n283\n00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.680\nAudio and video playback, drives, right?\n\n284\n00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.180\nIf you wanted to connect\nthem to different drives.\n\n285\n00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:53.290\nThe most important one that I had to\nworry about in true production here\n\n286\n00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.030\nwas really this, the printers, okay?\n\n287\n00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.250\nAnd that is actually clear and\nthat's one of the hard things to do.\n\n288\n00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.292\nSet up printer redirection to where\nthey print to a printer that's near them\n\n289\n00:15:03.292 --> 00:15:04.869\ninstead of printer on the third floor.\n\n290\n00:15:04.869 --> 00:15:05.957\nThat's pretty harsh.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Yeah,\n\n291\n00:15:05.957 --> 00:15:09.014\nwe actually got a comment in chat about a\nparticular scanner that someone was having\n\n292\n00:15:09.014 --> 00:15:09.591\nan issue with.\n\n293\n00:15:09.591 --> 00:15:10.932\nAnd sometimes-\n&gt;&gt; A scanner, yep.\n\n294\n00:15:10.932 --> 00:15:11.787\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n295\n00:15:11.787 --> 00:15:16.622\nsometimes you might just have to put\nit to a full blown desktop [CROSSTALK].\n\n296\n00:15:16.622 --> 00:15:19.693\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and\nthat's usually a good reason for it,\n\n297\n00:15:19.693 --> 00:15:22.680\nbut you can see where all that's done.\n\n298\n00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.997\nAnd then of course this one\nUPD I said U VDS at some point.\n\n299\n00:15:27.997 --> 00:15:29.130\n&gt;&gt; In the previous.\nYes.\n\n300\n00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:34.010\n&gt;&gt; My mind but it's actually\ncalled UPDS or user profile disks.\n\n301\n00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:38.930\nThese user profile disks now if you end up\ncreating those virtual desktops session\n\n302\n00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.700\nthe full desktop sessions.\n\n303\n00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:44.518\nWhat ends up happening now is\nthat if you select this and\n\n304\n00:15:44.518 --> 00:15:48.585\nyou enable this to a shared location,\nby doing this here,\n\n305\n00:15:48.585 --> 00:15:53.409\nand then you type in the URL, or\nthe, yeah, no, not URL, UNC path.\n\n306\n00:15:53.409 --> 00:15:54.743\nI couldn't remember what it was called.\n\n307\n00:15:54.743 --> 00:15:57.379\nYou type in the UNC path here\nto where it's gonna connect.\n\n308\n00:15:57.379 --> 00:16:01.697\nWhen you go ahead and do that And you\nlog off, it creates your virtual profile\n\n309\n00:16:01.697 --> 00:16:05.407\ninside of a VHD file, is what it does and\nthen when you log back on,\n\n310\n00:16:05.407 --> 00:16:08.900\nit knows exactly where to go and\nset that up for you.\n\n311\n00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.060\nSo there's a lot of different things\nthat you can do here to make sure that\n\n312\n00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.010\nthat's happening.\n\n313\n00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.420\nI wanna see if I actually did finally\nconnect back in, there we go.\n\n314\n00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:20.450\nLet me see if I can go\nback to this website.\n\n315\n00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.300\nI think I clicked on it, there we go.\n\n316\n00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:26.820\nSo, it's just making me wait, of course.\n\n317\n00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.160\nI was just hoping to be able to\nshow you exactly what I was wanting\n\n318\n00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.730\nto talk about right there.\n\n319\n00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:35.660\nAll right, from that point, once you get\neverything set up the way that you want\n\n320\n00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:41.740\nto, that is part of the properties of\nmaking sure that everybody has the smooth\n\n321\n00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.810\nand the desired collection\nsettings that they want.\n\n322\n00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:49.280\nNow here's where we wanted get to\nwhich is the remote app programs.\n\n323\n00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.820\nRemote app programs is how we choose to\npublish whatever applications that we want\n\n324\n00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:53.920\nto, okay.\n\n325\n00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.730\nSo let's take for an example that we don't\nreally need these particular programs but\n\n326\n00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.540\nwe need other programs.\n\n327\n00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.370\nSo I'm gonna click on Task and\nUnpublish these.\n\n328\n00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.500\nThe way I do that is I select that,\nI go to Task, I right-click or\n\n329\n00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.030\nI just click on the drop down,\nand that brings me here.\n\n330\n00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:15.330\nAnd I'm simply gonna unpublish these\nparticular apps so they no longer show up.\n\n331\n00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.300\nNow once I do that though,\n\n332\n00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:23.400\nlet's say that I wanted something like\nMicrosoft Office to show up here instead.\n\n333\n00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:28.510\nWell, I don't want just an installation\nof Microsoft Office to show up or\n\n334\n00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:30.840\nan installation file of\nMicrosoft Office to show up.\n\n335\n00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.010\nI want them to be able\nto use Microsoft Office.\n\n336\n00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:39.080\nSo that means now I need to go back over\nto my remote desktop connection here,\n\n337\n00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:39.885\nmy server.\n\n338\n00:17:43.686 --> 00:17:49.830\nLog in, and\nthen I need to install those apps.\n\n339\n00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:55.620\nNow installing Office\ncan take a long time.\n\n340\n00:17:55.620 --> 00:18:01.110\nSo instead, what we're gonna do is we\nare actually going to install in are.\n\n341\n00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:02.360\n&gt;&gt; Some lightweight apps?\n\n342\n00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.190\n&gt;&gt; Some very lightweight apps some\nviewers is what we are going to do.\n\n343\n00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.780\nSo I need to connect into\nmy shared folder system,\n\n344\n00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.606\nwhich I forgot to attach this morning.\n\n345\n00:18:12.606 --> 00:18:15.187\nSo we'll do it right here [SOUND].\n\n346\n00:18:15.187 --> 00:18:19.660\n&gt;&gt; And then the viewers that Ronny's going\nto install, we're gonna be looking at Word\n\n347\n00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.880\nviewer, we've got Excel viewer and\nPower Point viewer.\n\n348\n00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:27.980\n&gt;&gt; And they're just to help us to\nmake sure that we can get access to.\n\n349\n00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:29.560\n&gt;&gt; To share this concept, yep.\n\n350\n00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.370\n&gt;&gt; To show that we are connecting in.\n\n351\n00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:36.850\nRight, at least I think we\nare connecting in, there we go.\n\n352\n00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.780\nLet me get access in and so\nhere is the PowerPoint viewer.\n\n353\n00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:47.480\nAnd I just have a little notification that\npopped up that's not big deal saying,\n\n354\n00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.080\nhey Ronnie, you haven't configured\nlicensing server cuz we're gonna do that\n\n355\n00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:50.978\nlater on in another show.\n\n356\n00:18:50.978 --> 00:18:51.552\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n357\n00:18:51.552 --> 00:18:53.280\nthat's why I'm trying to not do that.\n\n358\n00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.798\nSo I'm going to launch that one up and\nmake sure that this installs.\n\n359\n00:18:59.675 --> 00:19:01.126\nJust as an example.\n\n360\n00:19:02.939 --> 00:19:05.638\nI'm gonna launch the Excel viewer\ncuz I'm getting impatient.\n\n361\n00:19:10.705 --> 00:19:12.102\nAnd they're both running which is great.\n\n362\n00:19:16.059 --> 00:19:18.609\nAnd let's see let's go and\naccept the one for Excel.\n\n363\n00:19:18.609 --> 00:19:21.979\nNow should you actually do\nthis in real life, no, okay.\n\n364\n00:19:21.979 --> 00:19:25.844\nYou should never try to install\ntwo programs at the same time, yes\n\n365\n00:19:25.844 --> 00:19:30.566\nthat's a bad, bad thing for me to do, but\nit will work is what we want to do here.\n\n366\n00:19:30.566 --> 00:19:35.581\nAnd then we'll install one\nmore at the end Right,\n\n367\n00:19:35.581 --> 00:19:37.766\nwhen everything's done,\nwhich is gonna be the Word app.\n\n368\n00:19:37.766 --> 00:19:42.500\nAnd that will give us a basic idea\nof what we normally hope to see.\n\n369\n00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.370\nNow, if you're doing this for\na real production environment and\n\n370\n00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.250\nyou're going hey,\nI really need to make sure this works,\n\n371\n00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.560\nmake sure you install that program, okay?\n\n372\n00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.450\nDon't do what I'm doing, just trying\nto make shortcuts for this, but\n\n373\n00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:57.290\nthis is for the sake of the continuity\nof our show where you're\n\n374\n00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:01.350\nnot sitting here watching us for 20\nminutes trying to install Office products,\n\n375\n00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.170\nis what we're gonna end up seeing here.\n\n376\n00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.219\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\nfrom the client side of things,\n\n377\n00:20:05.219 --> 00:20:08.880\nwould these applications automatically\nappear within my session?\n\n378\n00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.120\nOr would that end user need to log off,\nlog back in?\n\n379\n00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.210\nHow does that work?\n\n380\n00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.890\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\nBelieve it or not, all you have to do is\n\n381\n00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.730\nkinda refresh the web page if you\nneeded to and that should work.\n\n382\n00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.470\nBut you may have to log off.\n\n383\n00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:21.660\nBut right now,\nnothing's gonna actually show up.\n\n384\n00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.800\nOkay so let's see here.\n\n385\n00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.320\nSo, right now,\nit's finally letting me back in.\n\n386\n00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:31.750\nSo, we'll see, right, if I've set this\nup correctly, what should happen now\n\n387\n00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:36.540\nis we shouldn't see Paint,\nCalculator, and Wordpad.\n\n388\n00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:39.120\nWe should instead see only\nthe apps that I publish here.\n\n389\n00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.090\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, here,\n\n390\n00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.650\nIf I select Publish RemoteApps.\n\n391\n00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.770\nLet me zoom back out, just a moment.\n\n392\n00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:49.380\nNow, if I take a look there's a lot of\ndifferent apps that are there, except for\n\n393\n00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.380\nthe one that I wanted.\n\n394\n00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.600\nSo I have to click Add, and\nthen I have to go and search for it.\n\n395\n00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.840\nThe great thing is I've done this a couple\nof times so I know where everything is.\n\n396\n00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.760\nSo I've now added in that Word viewer.\n\n397\n00:21:02.785 --> 00:21:05.450\nIf I go back in I'll select\nMicrosoft Office again.\n\n398\n00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.425\nI'll add in Excel.\n\n399\n00:21:10.815 --> 00:21:14.374\nAnd we'll do one more for\ngood old PowerPoint here.\n\n400\n00:21:14.374 --> 00:21:16.337\nAt least I think, yeah,\nthat's the one that's left.\n\n401\n00:21:18.438 --> 00:21:21.425\nClick Next, and I click Publish.\n\n402\n00:21:23.547 --> 00:21:27.268\nAll right, so hopefully once everything\nactually is published in the way that we\n\n403\n00:21:27.268 --> 00:21:30.440\nwant it to, it should give us\na verification that everything is being\n\n404\n00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.370\ndone, but it does take a moment, right?\n\n405\n00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:36.372\nSo when these apps are published, they\nshould tell us that they are published,\n\n406\n00:21:36.372 --> 00:21:37.877\nwhich means now we are ready.\n\n407\n00:21:40.725 --> 00:21:46.563\nSo if I scroll back over here\nto my client connection,\n\n408\n00:21:46.563 --> 00:21:49.301\nITProTV demo User 01.\n\n409\n00:21:53.419 --> 00:21:55.264\nI don't think I can\ntype my password today.\n\n410\n00:21:59.477 --> 00:22:03.070\nAnd that will log on, and\nwe'll see exactly what we get access to.\n\n411\n00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:06.100\nSo either one of three things\nare gonna happen here Cherokee.\n\n412\n00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.370\nEither it's gonna give me\nthe same default apps,\n\n413\n00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.248\nwhich means I've done it completely wrong.\n\n414\n00:22:10.248 --> 00:22:13.475\nOr it's gonna give me no apps,\nwhich means I've done it completely wrong.\n\n415\n00:22:13.475 --> 00:22:16.268\nOr give me the actual apps that I wanted,\nwhich means I've done it right.\n\n416\n00:22:16.268 --> 00:22:18.228\n&gt;&gt; Lookie there, we've got.\n\n417\n00:22:18.228 --> 00:22:19.017\n&gt;&gt; Look at that.\n\n418\n00:22:19.017 --> 00:22:24.240\n&gt;&gt; Excel, you zoom in there,\nWord viewer, and our Powerpoint viewer.\n\n419\n00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.680\nSo it went one of the ways.\n\n420\n00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it actually did work,\nI know, it's like, surprise!\n\n421\n00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:30.710\nHere it is, right.\n\n422\n00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:34.100\nSo the very fact is, we can do this,\nit actually does work.\n\n423\n00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.130\nAnd what I was trying to\nshow from earlier, and\n\n424\n00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.180\nI don't know why this setting\nisn't taking place, and\n\n425\n00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.750\nit might have to be somewhere else\nwhere I also have to set this.\n\n426\n00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.740\nBut one of the default things that we set\nas far as the connection properties is\n\n427\n00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.900\nthat it should have chosen drives,\nbut this one didn't.\n\n428\n00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.390\nSo that may be something else I\nhave to explore and have to go and\n\n429\n00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:55.780\nresearch a little bit more, a little bit\nfurther to be able to get connected to and\n\n430\n00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.170\nmake sure that everything works, okay?\n\n431\n00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:01.170\nSo when you have something like this,\nit does happen and\n\n432\n00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:02.300\nthis is exactly what we want.\n\n433\n00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.930\nSo what happens now, Cherokee?\n\n434\n00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:07.130\nNow, that we've got everything\nthat we think that we do.\n\n435\n00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:08.760\nAnd now, somebody else comes in and\n\n436\n00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:13.748\nsays but, I still need that remote\ndesktop connection setting.\n\n437\n00:23:13.748 --> 00:23:17.090\nWell, remember what I told you,\nkind of the best practice or the way that\n\n438\n00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:22.250\nMicrosoft does it is look, you can do one,\nyou can do the other but not both.\n\n439\n00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:25.430\nLet me show you right\nhere on the screen again.\n\n440\n00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:28.310\nNow notice it says remote apps and\ndesktops.\n\n441\n00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:31.800\nBut it actually only gives me remote apps,\nright?\n\n442\n00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.630\nSo at this point it's not really working.\n\n443\n00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:38.080\nSo it either does one or the other.\n\n444\n00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.300\nBut the great thing is there's kind\nof a work around that you can do.\n\n445\n00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:45.240\nOnce again, let me put a disclaimer\non this, not supported by Microsoft.\n\n446\n00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.730\nSo in other words,\nif it doesn't work, it doesn't work.\n\n447\n00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:51.150\nAnd they are not going to say,\nthis is how you get it to work Ronnie,\n\n448\n00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:53.320\ndoing something that we\ndon't want you to do.\n\n449\n00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.755\nSo let's go back in and\nwe'll change this up.\n\n450\n00:23:55.755 --> 00:24:02.231\nSo I'm back on to my quick session and\nthen I'm gonna click on Tasks.\n\n451\n00:24:02.231 --> 00:24:06.136\nAnd I'm gonna publish\nanother remote app here.\n\n452\n00:24:06.136 --> 00:24:10.540\nThe great thing is the remote\ndesktop connection is right here.\n\n453\n00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:16.375\nAnd when I click Next,\nnow I can add it in and I can publish it.\n\n454\n00:24:18.851 --> 00:24:20.570\n&gt;&gt; Look at you breaking all the rules.\n\n455\n00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:21.857\nYou were making fun of me earlier.\n\n456\n00:24:21.857 --> 00:24:23.070\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, breaking all the rules.\n\n457\n00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.680\nThat's right, breaking all the rules,\n\n458\n00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.890\nmaking sure that everything kind of comes\nup the way that I want it to instead.\n\n459\n00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:32.360\nSo, we can add that in directly there and\n\n460\n00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:37.590\nnow if it is all published, let's see if\nI can just refresh this desktop here.\n\n461\n00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:38.230\nLet's see what happens.\n\n462\n00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:39.040\nLet's see.\n\n463\n00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:39.940\nLook at that.\n\n464\n00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.660\nJust refreshing the desktop.\n\n465\n00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:42.750\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Added in that remote\n\n466\n00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.500\ndesktop connection.\n\n467\n00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.750\nNow let's verify and see.\n\n468\n00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:53.900\nDid I truly do this or\nam I not doing this at all?\n\n469\n00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:59.790\nSo user 01,\nsimply typing in my credentials there.\n\n470\n00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:04.390\nClick OK, and now we'll see that we\ncan simply do something like this.\n\n471\n00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:10.850\nSo it allows us to be able to have access\neven though we're not supposed to,\n\n472\n00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:15.750\nbut of course it will connect and it just\ntakes a little bit more time doing this.\n\n473\n00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:17.450\nNow there is something\nstrange in the background\n\n474\n00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.730\nI didn't point out cuz it's about to\nchange over and it'll probably do over.\n\n475\n00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.270\nNotice that there's\nanother link over here.\n\n476\n00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:26.370\nI've been trying to ignore on purpose and\nnow there it is, okay?\n\n477\n00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:27.290\nSo that pops up.\n\n478\n00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:29.280\nIt says connect to the remote PC.\n\n479\n00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.420\nI can still do that.\n\n480\n00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:35.510\nI can actually instead of putting in and\npublishing it here, I can switch on over\n\n481\n00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:40.500\nhere and connect to that remote\nPC by using just this web page.\n\n482\n00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:48.110\nBut since I went ahead and brought it up\nthe old standard way here, Let's do this.\n\n483\n00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:49.430\nSo this rd01itprotvdemo.\n\n484\n00:25:54.468 --> 00:25:55.849\nOops.\n\n485\n00:25:55.849 --> 00:25:59.044\nDemo.com.\n\n486\n00:26:04.168 --> 00:26:10.100\nMy password is not super complicated but\nI do apparently have issues typing it in.\n\n487\n00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.820\nSo now we should be able to get connected\nin and have our full desktop session\n\n488\n00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:18.650\nready to go if everything does secure,\neverything that we said it should.\n\n489\n00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:22.510\nSo, we can modify that collection\ntower we need to to make it work\n\n490\n00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:24.700\nthe way that we need to, okay?\n\n491\n00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.150\nMost of the time, right?\n\n492\n00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:29.600\nIf this is all you need,\nit really does begin here, okay?\n\n493\n00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.670\nBut we're not completely down yet\nand everything.\n\n494\n00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:33.730\nAnd hopefully, there it goes.\n\n495\n00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:36.270\nI was gonna say, this is taking\nlonger than I thought it would.\n\n496\n00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:41.350\nBut there it is we are now logged\nin as a remote desktop user.\n\n497\n00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.732\nThere is a limitation though,\nCherokee that I have okay?\n\n498\n00:26:43.732 --> 00:26:48.110\nRemember that little window I said we\nshould ignore, we shouldn't worry about.\n\n499\n00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:51.934\nIt still has the same limitations as it\nwere trying to connect we're in a desktop\n\n500\n00:26:51.934 --> 00:26:53.567\nsession into a server right now.\n\n501\n00:26:53.567 --> 00:26:55.690\nBecause there's no licensing,\n\n502\n00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:59.190\nthe maximum number of connections\nI can have is two, okay?\n\n503\n00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:05.220\nSo if I have a group of employees of 50,\nwell, that's kind of crummy.\n\n504\n00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; At this particular point.\n\n505\n00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.530\nSo there's something else that\nwe definitely need to add in.\n\n506\n00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:12.110\nAnd we still need to take care of.\n\n507\n00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:15.960\nBut at the same time, the other things\nthat we were pointing out earlier.\n\n508\n00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.240\nLet me close out of this.\n\n509\n00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.586\nI'm gonna just simply disconnect here.\n\n510\n00:27:20.723 --> 00:27:23.370\nWe still need to take care of this, okay?\n\n511\n00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:24.330\n&gt;&gt; Our certificate issue?\n\n512\n00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:29.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the very fact is we're still\nnot secure in what we end up doing here.\n\n513\n00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:33.060\nSo this is something that we definitely\nneed to make sure that we take care of.\n\n514\n00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:37.250\nAnd that means we've gotta go into\ninstalling some certificates to\n\n515\n00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:38.445\nmake this work.\n\n516\n00:27:38.445 --> 00:27:42.560\nThat's gonna be better for us in the long\nrun especially we know that we gonna be\n\n517\n00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.870\nusing this and people are gonna be\nconnecting in remotely from the outside.\n\n518\n00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:50.720\nIt adds in how we secure the remote\ndesktop connections as well.\n\n519\n00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.810\nSo that's something else that we\ndefinitely need to see in the single\n\n520\n00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:55.070\nserver environment.\n\n521\n00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:56.690\nAnd once we're done with that,\n\n522\n00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.990\nthen at that point we can start talking\nabout some of these other issues.\n\n523\n00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.640\nAnd we'll bring that all up together.\n\n524\n00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.790\nBut, Cherokee,\nI think I've ran out of time again and\n\n525\n00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:07.490\nthat means that we need to go ahead and\nend this show.\n\n526\n00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:08.780\n&gt;&gt; All right, we'll go ahead and do that.\n\n527\n00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:09.960\nBut thank you so much, Ronnie for\n\n528\n00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:14.370\njoining us today to show us how to\ncustomize those individual sessions and\n\n529\n00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:18.120\nI can't wait to look at how to really\nsecure those connections as well.\n\n530\n00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.890\nAnd thank you, ladies and\ngentlemen, for tuning in.\n\n531\n00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:20.730\nLet's stay tuned.\n\n532\n00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:23.160\nWe have more remote desktop\nservices headed your way.\n\n533\n00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.750\nI'm going to go ahead and sign off\nas your show host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n534\n00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:27.660\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n535\n00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:31.012\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n536\n00:28:31.012 --> 00:28:36.999\n[MUSIC]\n\n537\n00:28:36.999 -->

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.531\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nRemote Desktop Services show.\n\n5\n00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:17.160\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.640\nNow, if you've being following along,\n\n7\n00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.210\nyou know that we've being heading down\nthis RDS journey, this path here.\n\n8\n00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.625\nAnd we're actually at the point where\nwe need to think about security.\n\n9\n00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:28.111\nWith the ominous presence of well,\nbad guys,\n\n10\n00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:31.120\nthis is definitely something\nthat we should consider.\n\n11\n00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.910\nSo in this show, we're gonna be\nlooking at Remote Desktop Services and\n\n12\n00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.170\nhow to secure those connections.\n\n13\n00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.600\nWith us today, we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong in studios.\n\n14\n00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.637\nThank you for joining us, Ronnie.\n\n15\n00:00:40.637 --> 00:00:41.931\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\n\n16\n00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:46.660\nhaving me back as we take a look\nnow at doing that idea of security.\n\n17\n00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.671\nThere's probably many ways that\nyou can think about security.\n\n18\n00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:52.493\nBut because of the way that\nRemote Desktop Services work,\n\n19\n00:00:52.493 --> 00:00:56.783\nyou've got to think a little\nbit beyond just kind of saying,\n\n20\n00:00:56.783 --> 00:01:02.840\nwe'll just limit it to the domain users,\nwe'll just restrict it to these people.\n\n21\n00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.515\nWhat we're also talking about, of course,\n\n22\n00:01:04.515 --> 00:01:06.639\nis ensuring that we are connecting\nto the right machine.\n\n23\n00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:07.855\nAlso, of course,\n\n24\n00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:13.110\nbeing able to secure the communications\nbetween those machines as well.\n\n25\n00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.270\nAnd the best possible way for us to do\nthis, if we're not sure where people\n\n26\n00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.880\nare connecting in from and\nfrom what machines and whether or\n\n27\n00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.040\nnot they've connected before,\nis to implement things like certificates.\n\n28\n00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.764\nAnd that is really what are show at least\nat this point is gonna focus in on,\n\n29\n00:01:28.764 --> 00:01:33.874\nis the idea of making sure that we use\ncertificates not only on the machines, but\n\n30\n00:01:33.874 --> 00:01:39.089\nalso on helping us to secure the Remote\nDesktop Services for those connections.\n\n31\n00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:41.790\nAnd we'll show you of course\nhow to get that done.\n\n32\n00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.400\nNow, up until this point, Cherokee,\nwe've gotten a few things configured.\n\n33\n00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.278\n&gt;&gt; Yes we have.\n&gt;&gt; So far, but\n\n34\n00:01:47.278 --> 00:01:50.352\nwe haven't configured everything that\nwe normally would need to configure.\n\n35\n00:01:50.352 --> 00:01:53.383\nSo we need to make sure that\nwe go through and do that, and\n\n36\n00:01:53.383 --> 00:01:56.180\nwe also need to make sure\nthat we use certificates.\n\n37\n00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.420\nSo let me go ahead and configure kind\nof the other two things first, and\n\n38\n00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.710\nthen we'll come back and\nwhat we'll do is certificates.\n\n39\n00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.080\nCuz, I held off on that.\n\n40\n00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.510\nI didn't mean to, but I did.\n\n41\n00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.580\nSo, let's finish up that idea,\nthe configuration of what we need to do.\n\n42\n00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.260\nSo everything so far in that quickstart.\n\n43\n00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.430\nWe already talked about what we need.\n\n44\n00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.460\nLet's take a look here at\nRemote Desktop Services.\n\n45\n00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.700\nSo, if I click on\nthe Remote Desktop Services and\n\n46\n00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.160\nI go to the overview,\nI'll see the ones that are in gray,\n\n47\n00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.870\nthese are the ones that are marked\nas being ready to operate.\n\n48\n00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.895\nThey are good to go, okay?\n\n49\n00:02:26.895 --> 00:02:27.525\nTo me, again,\n\n50\n00:02:27.525 --> 00:02:32.845\nremember that I mentioned this,\nthis seems so backward intuitive to me.\n\n51\n00:02:32.845 --> 00:02:35.055\nGray normally means it's not functional,\nat least for\n\n52\n00:02:35.055 --> 00:02:37.205\nme when I start seeing applications here.\n\n53\n00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:38.945\nLike, I can't access it,\nI can't do anything.\n\n54\n00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:40.525\nBut that's not the way it is.\n\n55\n00:02:40.525 --> 00:02:43.255\nIt's the green plus signs that tell\nyou that something else needs to\n\n56\n00:02:43.255 --> 00:02:44.440\nbe configured.\n\n57\n00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.740\nIf I want more than one or two, actually,\ntwo connections to happen, okay,\n\n58\n00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.110\nto this server at any one time, I'm going\nto need to add in a licensing server.\n\n59\n00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.655\nSo I'm going to go ahead and\nclick on this green plus sign.\n\n60\n00:02:57.655 --> 00:03:00.139\nAnd when I do so, it's going to say, hey,\n\n61\n00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.710\nwhere do I want the licensing\nserver to be installed?\n\n62\n00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.950\nAnd this is important.\n\n63\n00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.400\nUp until this point,\nwe've installed everything on RD01.\n\n64\n00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.910\nCan I continue to do that if I want to?\n\n65\n00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.740\nAbsolutely, you can.\n\n66\n00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.600\nBut a licensing server is probably one of\nthose roles that you really want to be\n\n67\n00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.830\noff by itself.\n\n68\n00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.010\nJust in case that Remote Desktop\nserver goes down,\n\n69\n00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.480\nyou want the licensing server to be up.\n\n70\n00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.420\nJust, when you bring it up,\npeople can connect in right away.\n\n71\n00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.970\nSo this time instead,\nI'm going to add this on to DC01 and\n\n72\n00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.190\nclick Next here and\nallow it to install the role.\n\n73\n00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.770\nNow, when it does so,\n\n74\n00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.450\nit's gonna install a couple of\nother things here at the same time.\n\n75\n00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.250\nAnd we need this to work,\nis what we need, right?\n\n76\n00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.960\nThe licensing server is important.\n\n77\n00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.383\nAs people connect in,\nthey are gonna get access to a license.\n\n78\n00:03:46.383 --> 00:03:49.950\nAnd now,\nwe actually need to have control of that.\n\n79\n00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.530\nThis is something you'll\nhave to go to Microsoft and\n\n80\n00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.190\nget that Remote Desktop licensing, and\nthe number of licenses that you get and\n\n81\n00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.090\neverything to make sure that it happens.\n\n82\n00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.539\nBut we're not gonna worry about that so\nmuch.\n\n83\n00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:01.980\nWe just need to install the role here.\n\n84\n00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.910\nWe'll talk about configuring those\nlicenses a little bit later.\n\n85\n00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.895\nBut now notice, there it is,\nlicensing server is now installed.\n\n86\n00:04:09.895 --> 00:04:11.850\nWe're fine and we are ready to go.\n\n87\n00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.160\nThe other thing that we need to do is if I\nthink that people are gonna be connecting\n\n88\n00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.019\nin from the outside of my network.\n\n89\n00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.800\nIf they're gonna be connecting in\nfrom the outside of my network,\n\n90\n00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.960\nI need this Remote Desktop gateway.\n\n91\n00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.910\nSo this is where you talk\nto whoever the owner is and\n\n92\n00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.920\nsay, is there a chance that we\nare gonna have remote users?\n\n93\n00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.148\nPeople that are gonna be\nlogging in [CROSSTALK]\n\n94\n00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:34.036\n&gt;&gt; Telecommuting.\n\n95\n00:04:34.036 --> 00:04:37.505\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, telecommuting, logging in\nover the weekend, outside, Salesforce,\n\n96\n00:04:37.505 --> 00:04:38.509\nwhatever it might be.\n\n97\n00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.050\nIf you are, you set up the RD gateway.\n\n98\n00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.704\nI'm simply gonna put this back on RD01.\n\n99\n00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.520\nAnd click Next.\n\n100\n00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.403\nAnd you'll see that it just kind of\ndoes its magic in the background,\n\n101\n00:04:49.403 --> 00:04:51.003\ninstalling the role that it needs to.\n\n102\n00:04:51.003 --> 00:04:54.440\nAnd now, notice it says, here it is.\n\n103\n00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.245\nThis is where we wanted to get to, because\nthis fills in with the certificate.\n\n104\n00:04:57.245 --> 00:04:57.800\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n105\n00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.743\n&gt;&gt; Says, hey, SSL certificates are used\nto encrypt communications between\n\n106\n00:05:02.743 --> 00:05:06.442\nRemote Desktop Services clients and\ngateway servers.\n\n107\n00:05:06.442 --> 00:05:08.632\nThat's how people connect in.\n\n108\n00:05:08.632 --> 00:05:13.110\nThe self-signed certificate must match\nthe fully qualified domain name.\n\n109\n00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.280\nSo it's telling you this\nis what you should do.\n\n110\n00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.230\nSo it's giving you this option right now.\n\n111\n00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.960\nAnd it says, look, if you're going to\ndo a remote gateway, at least have\n\n112\n00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.330\na certificate on it so I know that that\ncertificate name is gonna be this.\n\n113\n00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.790\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie, what are we talking about\nhere, internal, external, does it matter?\n\n114\n00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.270\n&gt;&gt; Well, for this one, this is gonna be\nwhat the clients would get if they connect\n\n115\n00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.770\nin from the external side.\n\n116\n00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.087\nSo right now it doesn't get\na self-signed certificate,\n\n117\n00:05:40.087 --> 00:05:42.415\nthat's still gonna leave that\nred bar in the address bar.\n\n118\n00:05:42.415 --> 00:05:44.017\nBut it will at least give\nthem that certificate.\n\n119\n00:05:44.017 --> 00:05:46.810\nAnd the strange thing is,\nwe already saw it, right?\n\n120\n00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.095\nSo even though we didn't have this\nset up as far as remote gateway,\n\n121\n00:05:50.095 --> 00:05:53.685\nif we were connecting in from\nthe Internet, this is what we're saying.\n\n122\n00:05:53.685 --> 00:05:55.150\nUse that same certificate.\n\n123\n00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.250\nBut we're already using it,\n\n124\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.950\nwe already showed you on the thin PC\nwhere we were actually able to use that.\n\n125\n00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.470\nSo now we're putting it on\nthat gateway server as well.\n\n126\n00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.460\nNow, we're gonna change that in a moment.\n\n127\n00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.120\nOr at least, during the show\nwe're going to change that, okay.\n\n128\n00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.689\nBut self-signed certificates,\nthey can work.\n\n129\n00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:13.508\nLike I said, inside of your network,\nmore than likely,\n\n130\n00:06:13.508 --> 00:06:15.740\na self-signed certificate would work.\n\n131\n00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.900\nI don't recommend it.\n\n132\n00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.021\nI don't think anybody at\nMicrosoft recommends that.\n\n133\n00:06:19.021 --> 00:06:22.630\nBut at the same time, it's not like I\nhaven't done it before, where I say, yeah,\n\n134\n00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.728\njust kinda ignore that.\n\n135\n00:06:23.728 --> 00:06:26.640\nBut it is a certificate there.\n\n136\n00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.020\nBut it's not something that\nwould be best practice, right?\n\n137\n00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.250\nSo here,\nwhat we really want to do of course\n\n138\n00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.930\nis get to that point where we're\nnot using self-signed certificates.\n\n139\n00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.380\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Especially if they're connecting in\n\n140\n00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.940\nfrom the outside.\n\n141\n00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.700\nThat would be terrible for\nus to be able to do.\n\n142\n00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.614\nSo while this is finishing installing\nhere, that's what we wanna do, is we wanna\n\n143\n00:06:45.614 --> 00:06:49.664\ntalk about this idea of using a different\ncertificate than what we're having here.\n\n144\n00:06:49.664 --> 00:06:53.180\nAnd then also do that for\nsome of the other things that we need.\n\n145\n00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.470\nAnd we'll show you where\nto configure that as well.\n\n146\n00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.080\nSo, Cherokee,\nwhen it comes down to certificates,\n\n147\n00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.200\nthere's really three different\ntypes of certificates we can use.\n\n148\n00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.160\nAnd the first one is\nwhat we just looked at.\n\n149\n00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.610\nA self-signed certificate unto itself.\n\n150\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.300\nOkay?\n\n151\n00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.808\nNow, is a self-signed certificate\nreally any worse than,\n\n152\n00:07:09.808 --> 00:07:12.560\nlike, a third-party certificate?\n\n153\n00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.440\nNo, they kind of give you the same thing.\n\n154\n00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.520\nBut the hard part about it is\nthat no one can validate that.\n\n155\n00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.160\nSo anybody can name their\ncertificate whatever they want to.\n\n156\n00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.378\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; And hand that to you.\n\n157\n00:07:22.378 --> 00:07:25.350\nSo that's probably the option\nwe want the least.\n\n158\n00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.309\nBut if I wanted to, though, Cherokee,\n\n159\n00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:30.350\nI could either get that\nthird-party certificate.\n\n160\n00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.030\nThe one that you can go out on\nthe Internet and find one and get that.\n\n161\n00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:38.293\nOr I can use an internal CA, an internal\ncertificate authority and do that too.\n\n162\n00:07:38.293 --> 00:07:41.868\nSo let's talk about the pros and\ncons of that a little bit, Cherokee, here.\n\n163\n00:07:41.868 --> 00:07:46.869\nSo let's talk about the pros here,\nthen, of using an internal CA.\n\n164\n00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:50.660\nWhat do you think some of the pros are for\nusing an internal CA?\n\n165\n00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nI worked at a company where the owner,\n\n166\n00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.872\nit was a high security environment.\n\n167\n00:07:55.872 --> 00:07:58.700\nSo they didn't want to give\nthat trust to a third entity.\n\n168\n00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.424\nThey said, no,\nwe're doing it all in-house.\n\n169\n00:08:00.424 --> 00:08:01.622\nSo that's one.\n\n170\n00:08:01.622 --> 00:08:06.846\nAll right, which saved money in\nthe long run because originally\n\n171\n00:08:06.846 --> 00:08:13.326\nyou're gonna have to pay someone who has\nthat technical skill set to go ahead and\n\n172\n00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:19.160\nset it up, but you're not paying\nan outsider, so, cost, all right.\n\n173\n00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.400\n&gt;&gt; Well and another one that you can think\nabout here especially if it's inside\n\n174\n00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.343\nof an Active Directory network,\nonce you set that up,\n\n175\n00:08:24.343 --> 00:08:29.220\nmachines that get joined to the domain and\nthey kind of auto enroll themselves.\n\n176\n00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.360\nSo it's not like you have to\ngo to every single machine,\n\n177\n00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.040\nI'm gonna start this enrollment process.\n\n178\n00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.510\nSo a lot of times,\nthose machines once you joined them,\n\n179\n00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.340\nthey've got the certificate,\nyou're ready to go.\n\n180\n00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.870\nNo big deal and\nthat sounds like a great idea.\n\n181\n00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.050\nSo, what are the drawbacks?\n\n182\n00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:44.847\nAnd it's cheaper.\n\n183\n00:08:44.847 --> 00:08:46.160\nI can do auto enrollment.\n\n184\n00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.110\nI save money, Cherokee it doesn't\nsound like the winning solution to me.\n\n185\n00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.580\nWhat's the cons?\n\n186\n00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.120\n&gt;&gt; Like you had mentioned\ngetting others to buy in to that\n\n187\n00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.970\nfact that you are who you say you are for\nthat authenticity.\n\n188\n00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.420\nYou might wanna go with a third party\nentity because they've already validated\n\n189\n00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.460\nyour credentials and they've done any kind\nof checksums to make sure that you in fact\n\n190\n00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.500\nare who you say you are.\n\n191\n00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.070\nYou might also wanna think\nabout maybe you don't have\n\n192\n00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:16.420\nthe resources in your environment\nto keep it up and running.\n\n193\n00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:20.720\nAnd so, you do wanna trust the reputation\nof that third party entity.\n\n194\n00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.920\nIt really is a judgement call,\nI think, Ronnie.\n\n195\n00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no doubt.\n\n196\n00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.800\nAs far as internal ones go,\nhere's where the drawbacks go, right?\n\n197\n00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.010\nThe very fact is you've gotta make\nsure that essentially there's a way,\n\n198\n00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.270\nthere's a path on those\nmachines that says, yes,\n\n199\n00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.980\nI point back to the root\ncertificate authority, okay?\n\n200\n00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.110\nAnd that sounds easy enough until you have\n1,000 machines and you have to go and\n\n201\n00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:41.750\nverify all of them, okay?\n\n202\n00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.190\nSo then it becomes a little\nbit more of a hassle.\n\n203\n00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:48.410\nThen also you have to make sure\nthat that means that remote users,\n\n204\n00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.930\nright, on the outside of our network, they\nalso have to have that same certificate on\n\n205\n00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.930\ntheir machines too that say yes,\n\n206\n00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.430\nI accept this as a valid trusted\nthird party certificate.\n\n207\n00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:02.560\nAs a trusted certificate authority,\nexcuse me on their machines as well.\n\n208\n00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:08.240\nSo the distribution of these,\neven though inside of the network, great.\n\n209\n00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.850\nOnce you get outside network,\nnot so great.\n\n210\n00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.340\nIt also means you have to\nhave somebody skilled enough,\n\n211\n00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.090\nproficient enough in understanding\nthe way that certificate authorities work\n\n212\n00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.780\nto make sure the it happens correctly.\n\n213\n00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.215\nSo there's a lot.\n\n214\n00:10:21.215 --> 00:10:24.490\nThere's a lot more to it than\nwhat we just kind of thing\n\n215\n00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.400\nthat may end up happening here.\n\n216\n00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.680\nSo we need to make sure\nthat all that is kind of\n\n217\n00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.610\nthe way that we need that we're\nusing that internal type of CA.\n\n218\n00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:38.490\nRight now in the public route when\nwe start taking that advantage\n\n219\n00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:42.180\nthe great thing is this is accepted by\neverybody, okay out on the Internet.\n\n220\n00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.550\nThird party certificate providers\nis kind of the standard.\n\n221\n00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:49.150\nAnd if you're gonna do anything,\nespecially on a real environment,\n\n222\n00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:53.290\nit is worth the money and the effort to\ngo through and get the certificates that\n\n223\n00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:56.280\nyou need from whatever your\ncertificate provider is gonna be.\n\n224\n00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.920\nNow I chose not to do that for\nour situation here.\n\n225\n00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.300\nI could have, and\n\n226\n00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:05.248\nthere are people out there that if you\nwant to choose to do this as a trial run.\n\n227\n00:11:05.248 --> 00:11:09.908\nYou can go out there and there are some\nthat say, hey, here's a 30 day trial\n\n228\n00:11:09.908 --> 00:11:14.810\ncertificate or here's another trial that\nyou can do and just expect marketing.\n\n229\n00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:16.159\n&gt;&gt; It should give you\nenough time to go ahead and\n\n230\n00:11:16.159 --> 00:11:17.224\ncomplete that testing or the lab.\n\n231\n00:11:17.224 --> 00:11:18.643\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it's worth it,\n\n232\n00:11:18.643 --> 00:11:21.850\nit really is, if you know that\nthis is gonna be set up that way,\n\n233\n00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:26.510\nthat way it can be verified that it can\nwork outside so all that is possible.\n\n234\n00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:30.250\nBut the very fact is, once you're at\nthe end, you've gotta make sure that\n\n235\n00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:34.910\nyou include in to everything that you're\ntelling them, that it includes that.\n\n236\n00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:35.890\nAnd that they have to go out and\n\n237\n00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:39.330\nmake sure they get the right\ncertificate that can be put on there.\n\n238\n00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.900\nNow the weird thing about\nthe use of these certificates,\n\n239\n00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.130\nbecause your environment in RDS can grow,\nright, you can choose to separate all\n\n240\n00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.880\nthose roles out into individual\nservers if you want to.\n\n241\n00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.470\nBut purchasing a certificate for\neach one of those can be a bit hefty.\n\n242\n00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.490\nAnd even if you get a wild\ncard certificate out there,\n\n243\n00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.020\nit can be a bit hefty\nin terms of the price.\n\n244\n00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.030\nSo, today,\nif you want to do something like that,\n\n245\n00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:05.690\nthere are people that have use what\nthey call SAN certificates instead,\n\n246\n00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.280\nones that are designed for,\nof course, for SAN access.\n\n247\n00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.460\nYou can do that, but\nI don't know what the implications are.\n\n248\n00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.400\nBut I've read several blogs that said,\nyeah, do that instead.\n\n249\n00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.380\nSo it's possible, so they are all\nout there for you to be able to do.\n\n250\n00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.100\nSo it's the best practice but\nthis point here.\n\n251\n00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:26.330\nThe only drawback of that third party type\nof certificate is really the cost, okay.\n\n252\n00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.800\nCuz they can be expensive and\nthey don't last forever.\n\n253\n00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.010\nSo if you set this up and\n\n254\n00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:33.770\na year later all of a sudden you\nforget to renew the certificate,\n\n255\n00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:38.690\nit can cause issues very quickly and then\nyou just have to wait for them to do so.\n\n256\n00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:41.730\nSo if you do that, make sure you\nmonitor and you do everything.\n\n257\n00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:43.100\nSo what did we choose to do?\n\n258\n00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.226\nWell here I chose instead\nto do an internal CA.\n\n259\n00:12:46.226 --> 00:12:50.286\nIt's a bit harder to get set up, than\nwhen I'm just trying to setup for lab,\n\n260\n00:12:50.286 --> 00:12:54.344\ncuz I had to bring up a national CA and\nget the enrollments process started and\n\n261\n00:12:54.344 --> 00:12:56.830\nget everything else that we needed here.\n\n262\n00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.720\nSo, I wanna check out a few things and\nmake sure that we're ready to go.\n\n263\n00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.510\nOkay, make sure that it happens.\n\n264\n00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.190\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n265\n00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:04.760\nSo now I've got every single installed and\n\n266\n00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.470\nthere was one last thing,\nof course I've clicked off of it.\n\n267\n00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.800\nThere was one last little tip down\nthere at the bottom that said,\n\n268\n00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:16.270\nhey if you're gonna use licensing here\nmake sure also, or the gateway, excuse me.\n\n269\n00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.370\nMake sure that you add in\nthe certificates that you need.\n\n270\n00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:21.640\nAnd we'll show you where to go and\ndo that in the app, okay?\n\n271\n00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.660\nSo I'm on my domain controller.\n\n272\n00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.680\nLet me go ahead and\nmake sure that everything for\n\n273\n00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.950\nthat certificate authority Is set up.\n\n274\n00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:33.190\nSo here it is, I've got the ADCS,\nright click and\n\n275\n00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.200\nlet me go down to Certificate Authority.\n\n276\n00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:40.670\nAnd here is my certificate authority\nwhere all the certificates are gonna be\n\n277\n00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.170\nissued from.\n\n278\n00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:47.340\nAnd it is one of these certificate\ntemplates that I need to get it set up.\n\n279\n00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:51.120\nWhen somebody trying to access my remote\ndesktop connection from the outside,\n\n280\n00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.890\nI need a web server certificate\nas what I need to be able to do.\n\n281\n00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:58.450\nSo this was taking just a bit of\ntime before everything comes in.\n\n282\n00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.276\nSo there is one for\nthe web server certificate and so\n\n283\n00:14:01.276 --> 00:14:04.246\nhere's a simple template\nthat's gonna be created.\n\n284\n00:14:04.246 --> 00:14:08.757\nBut right now I don't have\nanybody pretty much saying, hey,\n\n285\n00:14:08.757 --> 00:14:12.070\nwe can enroll these certificates.\n\n286\n00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:16.800\nSo it's here that we have to do a little\nbit more configuration tools and\n\n287\n00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.750\nsites and services.\n\n288\n00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.890\nNow this is going a little bit beyond\nscope, but I need to check and verify so\n\n289\n00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.550\nthat's what I'm trying to do here.\n\n290\n00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:26.170\nSo this is not a certificate authority\nshow, that's what I'm trying to say.\n\n291\n00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:31.060\nSo if I go to, let's see here\nunder Active Directory Sites and\n\n292\n00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.350\nServices, I need to find Services node.\n\n293\n00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.900\nAnd then inside of Services here,\n\n294\n00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.720\nlet me see if I can zoom in so\nthat we can see it.\n\n295\n00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.330\nPublic Key Services, and\nthen Certificate Templates.\n\n296\n00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.369\nSo I need to make sure that that\nweb server certificate template\n\n297\n00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.410\ncan be enrolled.\n\n298\n00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:55.630\nSo I double click on it and\n\n299\n00:14:55.630 --> 00:15:00.090\nselect Security, I wanna verify\nan enrollment so there it is.\n\n300\n00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:04.910\nSo I didn't do that would not have been\nable to do anything if I chose that or\n\n301\n00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:05.730\nif I forgot to do that.\n\n302\n00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.285\nSo now that I've got that set up, I'm\ntrying to make sure that I go through in\n\n303\n00:15:11.285 --> 00:15:13.070\nmy mind every thing else that I need to.\n\n304\n00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:18.203\nBut now that that is done,\nit is at this point then that I need\n\n305\n00:15:18.203 --> 00:15:23.860\nto verify that I have a certificate\non my own certificate server.\n\n306\n00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:31.259\nSo it's here on IIS, if I right-click on\nDC01 and Internet Information Services.\n\n307\n00:15:33.373 --> 00:15:38.060\nI want to verify that I have a server\ncertificate set up for my DC01.\n\n308\n00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.650\nSo I select the web server, DC01.\n\n309\n00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:46.240\nAnd then I'll look for\nserver certificates.\n\n310\n00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.580\nAnd you can see right here, because\nthis is actually enrolled itself here.\n\n311\n00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:55.861\nNotice it says that the CA issued\na certificate to what, itself okay,\n\n312\n00:15:55.861 --> 00:16:01.518\nso here it is the CA issued certificate\nto itself, also for the web server.\n\n313\n00:16:01.518 --> 00:16:05.253\nThe CA issued a certificate to DC01.net.\n\n314\n00:16:05.253 --> 00:16:07.990\nSo, that is good and\nthat is set up the way that we want to.\n\n315\n00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.427\nNow that we've got that,\n\n316\n00:16:11.427 --> 00:16:17.304\nthe other thing that needs to happen\nthen is over on the remote desktop 01.\n\n317\n00:16:20.245 --> 00:16:25.820\nThis particular web server also needs\nthat certificate as well, okay?\n\n318\n00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.562\nSo, we need to make sure that\nwe get that one set up too.\n\n319\n00:16:30.478 --> 00:16:35.615\nSo, if I go over here inside of\nthe remote desktop 01, and I select\n\n320\n00:16:35.615 --> 00:16:42.180\nthe IIS because this is the one, this is\nwhere my remote gateway is going to be.\n\n321\n00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.166\nSo, it's on this server that\npeople are gonna connect in.\n\n322\n00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.644\nI need to essentially do the same thing.\n\n323\n00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.680\nNow, you'll notice right here that it has,\nwell, two certificates.\n\n324\n00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:02.630\nBut, notice that their both self signed,\nokay?\n\n325\n00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.170\nSo, it's issued itself a certificate and\n\n326\n00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.400\nthat doesn't really mean\nthe one that we really want.\n\n327\n00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.935\nThis is where I have to come over\nhere to the right hand side,\n\n328\n00:17:11.935 --> 00:17:15.275\ncreate a certificate request,\nat least I hope I clicked on it.\n\n329\n00:17:18.217 --> 00:17:18.810\nMaybe I did.\n\n330\n00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:19.700\nMaybe I didn't.\n\n331\n00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.290\nSo, it's gonna generate for\nme the certificate request and\n\n332\n00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:23.870\nI have to fill it out.\n\n333\n00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:26.720\nUsually, of course, if you do this,\nthis is great because you\n\n334\n00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.910\ndo need to make sure that you fill\nthis out the way that you want to.\n\n335\n00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:35.470\nSo, I'm gonna do RR01 ITProTV demo.com.\n\n336\n00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:39.709\nThe organization is going\nto to itprovetv.demo.\n\n337\n00:17:39.709 --> 00:17:41.970\nAnd the organization unit,\nwe will call it Our Shows.\n\n338\n00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:47.870\nThis point and\nthis is going to be Gainesville, Florida.\n\n339\n00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.260\nAll of this would be important information\nto who ever this certificate authority is.\n\n340\n00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.130\nAnd if you ever do this for\n\n341\n00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.920\nthrid party certificate authority,\nyou still have to fill out their form too.\n\n342\n00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.810\nSo, that's exactly what you're doing.\n\n343\n00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.780\nProviding a cryptographic\nservice provider,\n\n344\n00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.920\nyou can do 1,024 bit if you're\nnot really concerned too much.\n\n345\n00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:13.200\nThe recommendation today, of course,\nwould be 4,096 as a minimum.\n\n346\n00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.120\nI'm gonna go in between cuz we're not\nreally doing this for real at this point.\n\n347\n00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.360\nBut yes, go with whatever\nthe minimum recommendation is or\n\n348\n00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.870\nhigher if you're gonna do that.\n\n349\n00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.470\nAnd then, it's gonna say hey,\nwhere do you want to store this?\n\n350\n00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.730\nWell, I wanna store this right here.\n\n351\n00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.590\nIn this particular PC I'm gonna\nput it in the documents folder.\n\n352\n00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:38.678\nI'm gonna call this one\nRD01 insert request.\n\n353\n00:18:38.678 --> 00:18:43.199\nAll right, let me see, there we go.\n\n354\n00:18:43.199 --> 00:18:44.669\nTrying to zoom out so I can get.\n\n355\n00:18:48.844 --> 00:18:50.659\nClick finish.\n\n356\n00:18:50.659 --> 00:18:51.278\nAll right.\n\n357\n00:18:51.278 --> 00:18:52.230\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; No big deal.\n\n358\n00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.769\nYup, now we have to request\nthe actual certificate here.\n\n359\n00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.100\nSo, the first thing that we need to do,\n\n360\n00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.230\nwe need to go in and\ngrab that certificate request.\n\n361\n00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.111\nI'm gonna copy it.\n\n362\n00:19:06.996 --> 00:19:12.178\nAnd then simply,\nif everything is set up correctly,\n\n363\n00:19:12.178 --> 00:19:17.940\nthrough my own web browser,\nI need to connect into.\n\n364\n00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.253\nThe certificate authority.\n\n365\n00:19:23.638 --> 00:19:25.492\nWhoops, if I can type.\n\n366\n00:19:25.492 --> 00:19:34.660\nITProTV demo.com Click okay.\n\n367\n00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.910\nAnd it may take a moment\nto see the connection,\n\n368\n00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.600\nit does take a little bit of time here.\n\n369\n00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.650\nBut, this is gonna bring me up to\nthat place where I can try and\n\n370\n00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.960\nget a certificate request done.\n\n371\n00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.637\nYeah, it's still spinning.\n\n372\n00:19:52.412 --> 00:19:55.014\nSeems-\n&gt;&gt; Now that's something you can disable\n\n373\n00:19:55.014 --> 00:19:57.270\nwhenever you set that server up.\n\n374\n00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.048\nThe enhanced security\nfeature that they offer.\n\n375\n00:19:59.048 --> 00:20:02.430\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and to tell you the truth,\nI realize I did something wrong here.\n\n376\n00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:06.840\nSo, I gotta go back over here\nto the domain controller.\n\n377\n00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.404\nAnd that's because I setup for HTTPS.\n\n378\n00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.952\nAnd I didn't setup the binding for it so,\n\n379\n00:20:13.952 --> 00:20:17.050\nyou might be wondering,\nshould I have to do this?\n\n380\n00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.040\nNo, if you're using\na third party certificate,\n\n381\n00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.290\nnone of this is actually required.\n\n382\n00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.800\nBut because I'm not,\n\n383\n00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.640\nthis is why you don't wanna do it\nthis way if you don't have the.\n\n384\n00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.660\nSo, now the binding is set.\n\n385\n00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.890\nI can go to SSL and require that.\n\n386\n00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:39.390\nAll right, so let me see if there's\nanything else that I need to do there.\n\n387\n00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:40.020\nAuthentication.\n\n388\n00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:45.533\nGotta turn on some authentication,\neverything is disabled.\n\n389\n00:20:45.533 --> 00:20:47.720\nAll right, so\nyou're starting to see something, right.\n\n390\n00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.440\nThe very fact is like, are you joking me?\n\n391\n00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.400\nNo, I'm not, okay.\n\n392\n00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:56.252\nIf you use an internal CA,\nit takes a bit of time.\n\n393\n00:20:56.252 --> 00:20:57.290\n&gt;&gt; Configuration.\n\n394\n00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:01.200\n&gt;&gt; Yeah especially we can like me I,\nyeah I forgot to set that up.\n\n395\n00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.900\nSo, now jus trying to get set\nup to request that certificate.\n\n396\n00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.188\n&gt;&gt; It is a lot of work you had at time but\n\n397\n00:21:06.188 --> 00:21:08.549\nthat's not something you're\ngonna be doing on a daily basis.\n\n398\n00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:12.972\nYou'll need to configured the client\nsystems more often than you would your\n\n399\n00:21:12.972 --> 00:21:16.853\nactual environment,\nyour CA configuration, hierarchy there.\n\n400\n00:21:16.853 --> 00:21:20.244\nAnd a lot of times people even chose\nto bring them offline ones you get\n\n401\n00:21:20.244 --> 00:21:23.278\nthem set up but,\nlike Ronnie said that's a different show,\n\n402\n00:21:23.278 --> 00:21:25.438\nwe do have a show for\nthat so check that out.\n\n403\n00:21:25.438 --> 00:21:29.156\n&gt;&gt; So hopefully, this certificate\nauthority does come up here we go I'm\n\n404\n00:21:29.156 --> 00:21:32.379\nnow getting look it's hey are you\nsure you want to do this?\n\n405\n00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:40.185\nSo, it's a good sign since it's\nasking me for some credentials.\n\n406\n00:21:40.185 --> 00:21:41.753\nI just need to be able to type now,\n\n407\n00:21:41.753 --> 00:21:45.260\nwhich is usually the hardest thing I\nhave to do on most of these shows.\n\n408\n00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:50.018\nMy typing skills are worse than my\nactual writing skills at times.\n\n409\n00:21:50.018 --> 00:21:51.414\nSo now, once we get connected,\n\n410\n00:21:51.414 --> 00:21:54.140\nyou'll see it brings up this\nnice little request page.\n\n411\n00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:58.120\nAnd since I selected that\nenrollment as well, the great thing\n\n412\n00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.530\nif everything is done correctly, and\nI always have to put that if cuz I never\n\n413\n00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:07.900\nknow if I do it correctly here, is that it\nwill automatically bring me a certificate.\n\n414\n00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:08.460\nSo.\n\n415\n00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.760\nhere it is I'm inside of the Microsoft\nActive Directory certificate server\n\n416\n00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.500\nITPROTVDemoDc01CA.\n\n417\n00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:21.499\nSo, I know I'm connected there,\nI request a certificate.\n\n418\n00:22:21.499 --> 00:22:22.650\nAt least l hope I clicked on it.\n\n419\n00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:28.430\nYeah, the little ball is spinning so\nthat's good and once I do this, right?\n\n420\n00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:32.520\nI have to paste in what I\ncopied to my clipboard, but\n\n421\n00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.580\nI need to be careful here, okay.\n\n422\n00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.490\nRight now,\nthe only thing that is setup for\n\n423\n00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:39.610\nas far as certificate type\nis a user certificate.\n\n424\n00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:43.580\nI could probably use it but overall\nthough I want a web server certificate.\n\n425\n00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.120\nSo, I'm gonna select advance\ncertificate request,\n\n426\n00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.770\nit's strange what they call advanced,\nright?\n\n427\n00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:51.840\nI think that that means\nreally complicated.\n\n428\n00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.460\nWhat they mean is more options.\n\n429\n00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:59.150\nSo instead of using the default option,\nwhat I mean by advanced is more options.\n\n430\n00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:02.850\nSo now it's gonna say, hey, which of\nthe following do I want to submit?\n\n431\n00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:04.540\nI'm going to select the second option.\n\n432\n00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:10.180\nWhich is the using\na base 64 encoded CMC or\n\n433\n00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:14.680\nPKCS number ten file is what\nwe're going to see here.\n\n434\n00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.570\nSo, everything is just kinda\ncommunicating back and forth and\n\n435\n00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.430\nit's here in the save request.\n\n436\n00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:23.850\nI'm going to right click,\npaste my request in.\n\n437\n00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.650\nIn the certificate template I'm\ngonna drop down to Web Cert,\n\n438\n00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.920\nthat's the one that I need you\nto kind of pay attention to.\n\n439\n00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:31.500\nClick Submit.\n\n440\n00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:39.750\nLet it do it's, yes, and notice it\nimmediately returned a certificate.\n\n441\n00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:40.920\nSo without SNA,\n\n442\n00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:45.880\nyou already selected enroll, you're\nan authenticated user as this machine.\n\n443\n00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:46.420\nSure thing.\n\n444\n00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.681\nI'm gonna download both of these.\n\n445\n00:23:48.681 --> 00:23:51.520\nI'm gonna download the certificate\nas well as that certificate chain.\n\n446\n00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:54.970\nLet me save this one.\n\n447\n00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:59.394\n&gt;&gt; Now does it matter that you have\nth DER encoded selected if you chose\n\n448\n00:23:59.394 --> 00:24:00.423\nthe basic C4?\n\n449\n00:24:00.423 --> 00:24:01.086\nNo.\n\n450\n00:24:01.086 --> 00:24:01.831\nIt doesn't.\n\n451\n00:24:01.831 --> 00:24:05.163\nWe just want, you know,\nwhat you might find out, right,\n\n452\n00:24:05.163 --> 00:24:10.030\nis as far as Microsoft, the DER in code\nis probably going to be the one you want.\n\n453\n00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:14.170\nBut as you go through and you go,\nI was looking for this one instead,\n\n454\n00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:18.250\nyou can go back and change this and\nresubmit the request.\n\n455\n00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:19.590\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And get everything back\n\n456\n00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.660\nthe way that you want to.\n\n457\n00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.068\nSo, I'm gonna just say,\nthis is gonna be the cert.\n\n458\n00:24:25.451 --> 00:24:26.660\nSave it in my downloads.\n\n459\n00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:27.750\nI need to remember where I saved it.\n\n460\n00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:29.925\nI've done that before, where I\ncouldn't remember where I saved it.\n\n461\n00:24:29.925 --> 00:24:30.760\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n462\n00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.320\nthen I'm also gonna download\nthis certificate chain.\n\n463\n00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.600\nI need that certificate chain when\nit comes to the remote gateway, and\n\n464\n00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.740\nwe're gonna see that.\n\n465\n00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:43.315\nSo, that's why I want to save this, cuz\nit's gonna require a different It's gonna\n\n466\n00:24:43.315 --> 00:24:48.509\nrequire a .pfx file is what it's gonna\nrequire so this one is gonna be RD01.\n\n467\n00:24:48.509 --> 00:24:51.746\nThis is gonna be .pfx instead.\n\n468\n00:24:55.458 --> 00:24:59.048\nAll right, so\nnow we've got our certificate,\n\n469\n00:24:59.048 --> 00:25:03.287\nwhich now means I need to\ninstall this into, well here.\n\n470\n00:25:04.877 --> 00:25:07.447\nSo I'm going to complete\nthe certificate request.\n\n471\n00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:13.399\nGo and\nfind the certificate I just downloaded.\n\n472\n00:25:16.162 --> 00:25:23.159\nFriendly name, we'll call it RD 01, and\nwe'll let it put it in the personal.\n\n473\n00:25:23.159 --> 00:25:24.595\nThat's fine, it's no biggie.\n\n474\n00:25:28.557 --> 00:25:30.970\nAnd then if everything actually\nworks here, it should accept it.\n\n475\n00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:34.410\nIf not, we'll have to actually figure\nout what the error pops up to be.\n\n476\n00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:37.770\nSometimes you will end up\nseeing where it will error out.\n\n477\n00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:41.960\nAnd on these other ones here,\nI'm going to remove these certificates.\n\n478\n00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.370\nNow, there is something that you\nhave to do with this, okay, and\n\n479\n00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:46.820\nyou've got a couple of options here.\n\n480\n00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:53.330\nBecause it's already using\nthe self science certificate,\n\n481\n00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:54.710\nas far as us connecting in,\n\n482\n00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:58.330\nthat's what we were using before,\nIt's not gonna let go of that, okay.\n\n483\n00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:01.530\nSo, some of the things you\nmight end up doing instead\n\n484\n00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:04.620\nis just restarting the server.\n\n485\n00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:08.130\nAnd that normally says, all right look,\nyou removed the other certificates.\n\n486\n00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:11.030\nHere's the certificate that's left,\nuse this one instead.\n\n487\n00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:12.790\nSo, we know that we can do that.\n\n488\n00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:19.100\nAnd then once that's actually done,\nThat should end up working for us instead.\n\n489\n00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.390\nSo, you definitely need to do that.\n\n490\n00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:23.730\nNormally, the only other thing\nI do in the lab instead,\n\n491\n00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:27.560\nbecause I never know if the restart works,\neven though I swear that it\n\n492\n00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.680\ndoesn't sometimes-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n493\n00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.030\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I reboot the server.\n\n494\n00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:30.710\nOkay?\n\n495\n00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:32.580\nSo, I get a little bit impatient.\n\n496\n00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:35.260\nWhen I reboot everything,\neverything seems to work.\n\n497\n00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:38.670\nAnd then we are all connected together and\nwe're up and going.\n\n498\n00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:39.280\nOkay?\n\n499\n00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:44.970\nSo, once we've got that connected here and\neverything is now\n\n500\n00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:49.620\nwhat should be right we\nnow need to go back and\n\n501\n00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:55.640\nstart to configure the use of\nthe certificates for then the other part.\n\n502\n00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.260\nRight?\n\n503\n00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:00.400\nThe RDS connections and\neverything else that we need.\n\n504\n00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.900\nBut that's gonna take longer than\nthe time that we have left right now in\n\n505\n00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.200\nthis episode.\n\n506\n00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:09.030\nSo Cherokee, it might be better instead\nif we try and start that in a part two-\n\n507\n00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:09.970\n&gt;&gt; Sounds great, Ronnie.\n\n508\n00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:10.570\n&gt;&gt; Instead.\n\n509\n00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:14.310\n&gt;&gt; We don't wanna rush through it, so\nwe'll go ahead and pick right back up so\n\n510\n00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.550\nstay tuned, but we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this show.\n\n511\n00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.119\nRemember, I'm your show host,\nCherokee Boose.\n\n512\n00:27:19.119 --> 00:27:20.250\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n513\n00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:23.706\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n514\n00:27:23.706 --> 00:27:29.786\n[MUSIC]\n\n515\n00:27:29.786 --> 00:27:32.965\n&gt;&gt; Thank

watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.010\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nRemote Desktop Services show.\n\n5\n00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.250\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.470\nIf you've been following along, you'll\nknow that this is actually a part II.\n\n7\n00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.980\nIn the previous episode we\nwere looking at creating and\n\n8\n00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.550\nestablishing a secure connection for\nyour remote desktop server.\n\n9\n00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.850\nIn this episode we will continue to go\nahead and finish the configurations.\n\n10\n00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.430\nWith us today we have\nMr Ronnie Wong in studios.\n\n11\n00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.890\nThank you for joining us today Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.690\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you for\n\n13\n00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.890\nhaving me back cuz we really do\nneed to finish the configuration.\n\n14\n00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.940\n&gt;&gt; If we're gonna have secure\nremote desktop services.\n\n15\n00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.790\nSo a little bit of a reminder, right?\n\n16\n00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.954\nIn our previous episode we went ahead and\nwe showed you how you have to establish\n\n17\n00:00:47.954 --> 00:00:52.520\nthose connections and whether what\nparticular certificate you wanna choose.\n\n18\n00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.940\nWe talked about the very fact that\nthere's three types of certificates.\n\n19\n00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.120\nThe self-signed ones,\n\n20\n00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.980\nwe can use an internal CA and\nof course you can use a third party CA.\n\n21\n00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.590\nAnd recommended best practices.\n\n22\n00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.652\nIf you're gonna be doing this in\na production network, of course,\n\n23\n00:01:05.652 --> 00:01:11.700\nit is always gonna be using the third\nparty CA to issue you certificates, why?\n\n24\n00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.000\nWell, one, it's valid on the Internet,\nthat's probably the biggest thing.\n\n25\n00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.630\nAnd if you're gonna be establishing remote\nconnections outside of your network,\n\n26\n00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.910\nthat's really gonna be helpful, as well.\n\n27\n00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.570\nWe're gonna use of course an internal\nCA which is what we did instead and\n\n28\n00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.250\nI showed that to you for a reason.\n\n29\n00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.100\nOne, it is more of a set up,\nthere is a lot more to do and\n\n30\n00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.080\nit requires a little bit more skill for\nyou to have that done.\n\n31\n00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.308\nBut if you needed to do this in a pinch,\nright?\n\n32\n00:01:36.308 --> 00:01:41.010\nAnd you go, we really don't want\nto afford to try and make or\n\n33\n00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.720\nto try and purchase a certificate\nout there on the internet.\n\n34\n00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.680\nWell, that's kind of a downfall too and so\nyou need to at least know how to do that.\n\n35\n00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.450\nSo, we went ahead previously and\n\n36\n00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.060\nshowed you how you can make sure that\nthose connections are secure in between.\n\n37\n00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.800\nOf course,\nbeing able to make that connection in,\n\n38\n00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.970\nbeing able to get the certificates\nthe way that we need to.\n\n39\n00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.720\nSo now that we've got certificates\non our web servers and\n\n40\n00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.020\nwe are now ready to have a connection\ncome in that's remote and\n\n41\n00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.010\nsecure, we now need to go, of course, go\ninto the remote desktop services and now\n\n42\n00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.850\nuse those certificates to help us out and\nto assign them to where they need to be.\n\n43\n00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.580\nSo that when people do connect that\nthey're actually using the remote\n\n44\n00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.640\ndesktop service,\n\n45\n00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.320\nwhich is depending on the certificate\nthat provide that security for them.\n\n46\n00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.700\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look in my machine.\n\n47\n00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.330\nAnd that's where we'll\nget started as well.\n\n48\n00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.608\nSo here we are.\n\n49\n00:02:28.608 --> 00:02:29.734\nI'm on the RD01,\n\n50\n00:02:29.734 --> 00:02:33.376\nwhich is going to of course be all\nwhere I've installed just about\n\n51\n00:02:33.376 --> 00:02:38.700\nevery remote desktop service role that I\nhad except of course for licensing server.\n\n52\n00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.320\nIf I click on my Server Manager,\nnow over on the left hand side,\n\n53\n00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.000\nI can select Remote Desktop Services.\n\n54\n00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.420\nAnd now it's saying, hey look you've got\nan issue, you've got a problem, Ronnie.\n\n55\n00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.260\nThe very fact is, you've actually\ngot this setup and now it's saying,\n\n56\n00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.030\nThe following servers in this deployment\nare not a part of this server pool.\n\n57\n00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.390\nWell that might be a little bit\ndisconcerting when you have something\n\n58\n00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.960\nlike this.\n\n59\n00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.360\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie when they say server pool,\n\n60\n00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.060\nthey're just talking about a logical way\nto organize the different servers in your\n\n61\n00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.340\nenvironment that are hosting\ndifferent roles?\n\n62\n00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.030\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n63\n00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.680\nThat's pretty much it in terms of\nthe way that Server 2012 and even 2008,\n\n64\n00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.180\nand a lot could do a little bit of this.\n\n65\n00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.880\nThe very fact is they're saying,\n\n66\n00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.450\nI'm noticing something\nthat you have RDS setup.\n\n67\n00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.740\nBut I'm also noticing you're\nmissing a particular server\n\n68\n00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.928\nthat's hosting a role for this.\n\n69\n00:03:24.928 --> 00:03:28.010\nAnd it is saying, I need to see that\ntoo if we're going to really do\n\n70\n00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.370\nthe deployment the way that we want to.\n\n71\n00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.800\nSo the easiest way to get that server back\nin is to click on servers underneath here.\n\n72\n00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.850\nMake sure I'm actually zooming in just\na little bit so that we can see that.\n\n73\n00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.260\nGonna go back and do that again.\n\n74\n00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.752\nServers and then once I select that,\nnotice it is missing the DC01.\n\n75\n00:03:46.752 --> 00:03:50.420\nI click on Manage and then Add servers.\n\n76\n00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.660\nOnce I do that, it's now gonna look\ninside of Active Directory and\n\n77\n00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.900\nclick Find now and\nthere's the servers that are available.\n\n78\n00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.520\nAnd I really only need to add in\nthe server that's missing, if I want to.\n\n79\n00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.870\nSo I just simply add that one in.\n\n80\n00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.870\nI always just add them\nboth in just in case.\n\n81\n00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.070\nI don't know why it makes me feel better,\nbut you only really need to add in one.\n\n82\n00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.660\nBut I always just go\njust in case it forgets.\n\n83\n00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.870\nAnd you'll see here in just a moment\nwhere I'll add both of those in.\n\n84\n00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.330\nSo once both of those are added in, I can\ncome back to Remote Desktop Services.\n\n85\n00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.200\nAnd now you'll see that the overview\nhas pretty much populated itself, but\n\n86\n00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.070\nCherokee I'm noticing something here.\n\n87\n00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.710\nAnd just a moment ago,\nit really did have all of these different\n\n88\n00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.090\ndeployment overview roles here,\nhad the green plus sign very quickly.\n\n89\n00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.170\nAnd that's because we hadn't\nlaunched it out before.\n\n90\n00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.140\nEverything that we did in\nthe configuration remote desktop services,\n\n91\n00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.600\nwe were just doing over on DC1.\n\n92\n00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.060\nAnd this is the first time\nwhere we're connecting in and\n\n93\n00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.750\nit didn't realize everything\nwas already configured.\n\n94\n00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.560\nSo this is where everything\nis now configured in\n\n95\n00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.020\nthe way that it needs to be and\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n96\n00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.620\nNow, even though all these\nroles are turned on and\n\n97\n00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.840\nI can see it through the deployment\nservers over on the right-hand side,\n\n98\n00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.200\nthat every single one of these roles\nhas now been assigned to a server.\n\n99\n00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.470\nAnd the key here, right is to make sure\nthat they're assigned to the ones that you\n\n100\n00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.130\nwant them to be assigned to.\n\n101\n00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.840\nThe only one role that we have hosting\nover on DCO1 is the licensing server.\n\n102\n00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.810\nAnd I made an issue about that in the\nprevious episode when I did this that even\n\n103\n00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.660\nthough we can't install licensing\nserver on our particular 1RD01\n\n104\n00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.840\nif I wanted to to make a full\nsingle server deployment aspect,\n\n105\n00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.500\nthat's something that we really don't\nwant to do if we don't need to.\n\n106\n00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.880\nSo here I just kind of offloaded the role\nto the domain controller at this point.\n\n107\n00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.130\nNow how do we install\nthe certificates into RDS?\n\n108\n00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.260\nI know that we can install it into the web\nserver, we showed you how to do that.\n\n109\n00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.641\nThat seems simple enough.\n\n110\n00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:50.158\nBut as far as certificates go in RDS here\nit doesn't really look like it's actually\n\n111\n00:05:50.158 --> 00:05:51.580\na simple thing to do.\n\n112\n00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.140\nBut it's really quiet simple as long\nas you have the right certificate.\n\n113\n00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.460\nSo sometimes you might be able to find it,\nsometimes you might not.\n\n114\n00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.520\nSo I wanna show you kind of both\nthings that can end up happening.\n\n115\n00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.000\nSo I'm gonna click on Tasks and then\nselect Edit Deployment Properties here.\n\n116\n00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.290\nMake sure we can see that.\n\n117\n00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.980\nEdit Deployment Properties, and\nonce we do so you'll end up noticing that\n\n118\n00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.810\ndeployment properties for\neverything inside of RDS is ready to go.\n\n119\n00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.480\nSo it sees the way that\nI've went ahead and\n\n120\n00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.928\nestablished the RD Gateway,\nright, my remote desktop gateway.\n\n121\n00:06:23.928 --> 00:06:28.098\nIt shows the server that everybody's going\nto be connecting to from the outside.\n\n122\n00:06:28.098 --> 00:06:32.730\nAnd this is how they're going to connect,\nwe also have the licensing server.\n\n123\n00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.980\nNow, this one we're going to kind of\nseparate this off into another show in\n\n124\n00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.600\na little bit here.\n\n125\n00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.470\nSo we're not gonna spend\na lot of time on this one.\n\n126\n00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:46.570\nBut normally we'll end up talking about\nthis idea of picking a per device or\n\n127\n00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:47.930\nper user.\n\n128\n00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.580\nWe're just gonna leave it alone for\nright now so\n\n129\n00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.620\nthat we can spend a little\nbit of time on it.\n\n130\n00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.680\nBut the other one here that's\nautomatically set up right when we\n\n131\n00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.890\nselect the quick start is gonna\nbe the remote desktop web access.\n\n132\n00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.390\nThis is where we went to the other\nserver or to the other machine,\n\n133\n00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:07.340\nwhich was my thin PC, my client 01.\n\n134\n00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.095\nConnecting in using the web browser and\nthe reason why we want this, right,\n\n135\n00:07:12.095 --> 00:07:16.493\nis now that I have a certificate,\nI want that connection to be secure.\n\n136\n00:07:16.493 --> 00:07:21.070\nBefore, when we connected in, we showed\nyou the address bar that was red.\n\n137\n00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:25.170\nAnd I said, yeah, there's a certificate\non it, and yes, you are connecting\n\n138\n00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.870\npossibly securely here, but the very fact\nis we can't verify that the origin of this\n\n139\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.340\ncertificate, so we can't really guarantee\nthat this is a secure type of connection.\n\n140\n00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.690\nSo we wanna change that\nis what we want to do.\n\n141\n00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.330\nWe want that to be changed.\n\n142\n00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.780\nWe want that ability to do so.\n\n143\n00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.760\nAnd that's what we need to do next,\nwhich is where we're gonna be heading.\n\n144\n00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so just to recap.\n\n145\n00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.790\nPreviously when we were receiving that\nwarning, that notification, it's because\n\n146\n00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.580\nwe were using a self-assigned certificate\nbut now, you're gonna be pointing towards\n\n147\n00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.715\na different certificate that has been\ngenerated from your internal CA.\n\n148\n00:07:54.715 --> 00:07:56.631\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nAnd whether it's internal CA or\n\n149\n00:07:56.631 --> 00:08:01.192\nwhether third party, the great thing is\nif they can find that certificate path\n\n150\n00:08:01.192 --> 00:08:04.731\nAll the way back to the root CA,\nit can be considered secure.\n\n151\n00:08:04.731 --> 00:08:09.370\nAnd this is where we mention one of\nthe downfalls, I don't wanna say downfall.\n\n152\n00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.450\nA kind of minor hinderance in terms\nof using an internal CA right.\n\n153\n00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:17.960\nIt means that everybody that connects in,\nso whether it's a traveling sales person\n\n154\n00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:23.490\non my as part of my company I have\nto ensure what that my internal\n\n155\n00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:28.930\nCA's root certificate is established\ninside of its trusted root authority.\n\n156\n00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.560\nNow if that machine's already\nbeen inside of my network and\n\n157\n00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:36.180\nI've already joined it to the domain\nat one point shouldn't be any problems.\n\n158\n00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.660\nBut if this is a brand new\nmachine from the outside and\n\n159\n00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.690\nsomebody's trying to connect in, well,\n\n160\n00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.320\nthey're probably not gonna be able to\nconnect in the way that they want.\n\n161\n00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.950\nAnd even if they do they're not gonna\nget that trusted root certificate.\n\n162\n00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.960\nSo that's something else that\nwe have to take a look at\n\n163\n00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.690\nif we're gonna be doing this.\n\n164\n00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.420\nSo it's simple,\nwe select Certificates at this point.\n\n165\n00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.900\nAnd now when we do so\nnotice that there's really four different\n\n166\n00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.520\nrole services that we now\nhave as unconfigured or\n\n167\n00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.650\nNot Configured I should say,\nokay, so Not Configured here.\n\n168\n00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:12.640\nWell there's three different levels of the\ncurrent certificate level deployment, and\n\n169\n00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.810\nlet me see if I can show you\nthe official documentation.\n\n170\n00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.350\nWhat is a certificate level?\n\n171\n00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.540\nAnd we'll talk about these just briefly so\n\n172\n00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.800\nthat we understand what it\nis that we're doing here.\n\n173\n00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.480\nSo sometimes,\nyou might come to this point and go,\n\n174\n00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.790\nwell, I know it's not configured cuz\nI didn't assign any certificates.\n\n175\n00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:28.940\nBut what about the other ones, right.\n\n176\n00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.600\nSo this one, I'm configured simple.\n\n177\n00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.490\nNobody has assigned any certificates.\n\n178\n00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.440\nSo what is everybody gonna be using,\na self-signed certificate.\n\n179\n00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.700\nPretty much is kinda where we might end\nup being but because it's not configured,\n\n180\n00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.010\nit's not really even using\nthat right now officially.\n\n181\n00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:47.700\nUntrusted, one or more of the certificates\nin your remote desktop service deployment\n\n182\n00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.150\nare self-signed.\n\n183\n00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.900\nSo if you wanted to officially\nuse the self-signed certificate,\n\n184\n00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.130\nnot just because you connected to\nthe web server, and you want RDS to\n\n185\n00:09:56.130 --> 00:10:00.480\npush it out as it's official certificate,\nyou can do this, okay?\n\n186\n00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.450\nNow, notice it says not trusted on\nremote computers, and that's key.\n\n187\n00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.920\nThe term remote computer here means\nanybody outside your network,\n\n188\n00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.760\nyou shouldn't trust this.\n\n189\n00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.270\nServer authentication will not work, so no\nremote desktop connection services here.\n\n190\n00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:19.050\nUsers will be warned before\nconnecting to the untrusted computer.\n\n191\n00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:21.150\nWell, that's a lot of hassle, right?\n\n192\n00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.280\nEverybody now begins to question,\n\n193\n00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.500\nespecially on your user that\nare connecting from the outside.\n\n194\n00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.870\nIs this okay?\n\n195\n00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:32.760\nAnd I don't care how many times they do\nit until they 100% trust that you go,\n\n196\n00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.660\nit's okay you can do this, they're gonna\nask you questions all the time about it.\n\n197\n00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.980\nSo we don't want those questions,\nwe wanna kind of get rid of that idea.\n\n198\n00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:45.840\nAnd that means we have to move to this\nlevel of what we call the trusted.\n\n199\n00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.780\nThe trusted level it says in remote\ndesktop services deployment,\n\n200\n00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:54.190\ncan be either an enterprise certificate or\na public certificate.\n\n201\n00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.300\nWe're gonna use an enterprise certificate,\none, because it was free.\n\n202\n00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.470\nDid it take a lot of setup?\n\n203\n00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.730\nDid it take some time to do so?\n\n204\n00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:04.730\nYes, but if you already have\na certificate authority ready to go and\n\n205\n00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.620\nable to issue out certificates,\nthen you don't have to worry about it.\n\n206\n00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.970\nBut if you don't, and you're setting up\nfor the first time, and let's say that you\n\n207\n00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.090\nare a contractor doing this, it can be\na little bit more of a hassle if you\n\n208\n00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:18.540\ndon't understand the inner workings of\nhow that system ends up working out.\n\n209\n00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.340\nSo what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna make sure then,\n\n210\n00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:25.470\nthat we need to get that particular\nroot certificate on those machines but\n\n211\n00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.010\nthe great thing is remember that it says\nenterprise certificates are trusted on all\n\n212\n00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.220\ncomputers that are joined to the domain.\n\n213\n00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.230\nSo as long as your computers\nare joined to the domain you\n\n214\n00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.690\nreally don't have to worry about it.\n\n215\n00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.970\nIf they're not joined to the domain that's\nwhen you have to do something a little bit\n\n216\n00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:39.480\nmore special.\n\n217\n00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:45.270\nOf course, public certificates are trusted\non all computers on the Internet and\n\n218\n00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.100\nusually by a trusted\nroute authority as well.\n\n219\n00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:52.370\nSo this is also a good thing, it means\nwe don't have to worry about another\n\n220\n00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.460\ninternal service that we've got to set up.\n\n221\n00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.960\nEverything is gonna be good, it's gonna\nwork, it's gonna validate as long as you\n\n222\n00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.300\nhave a connection to the Internet,\nthat machine should be able to find that\n\n223\n00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.330\nconnection and be able to validate\neverything that it needs to.\n\n224\n00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.040\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n&gt;&gt; So that is the one that we wouldn't\n\n225\n00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.190\nnormally want to do, all right?\n\n226\n00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.888\nSo that is where we are headed.\n\n227\n00:12:11.537 --> 00:12:16.067\nSo the good thing is now that we've\nalready set up them where we know that we\n\n228\n00:12:16.067 --> 00:12:20.819\ncan retrieve that web server certificate\nand we've installed it into our web\n\n229\n00:12:20.819 --> 00:12:26.360\nserver, we now need that certificate to\nalso get installed in one of these roles.\n\n230\n00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.780\nNow notice that we have two options here,\nokay?\n\n231\n00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.150\nWe have Create a new certificate.\n\n232\n00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.050\nWell that would be creating\na self-signed certificate.\n\n233\n00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:37.888\nThat's not gonna help us, but in in\na pinch if that's what you need to do,\n\n234\n00:12:37.888 --> 00:12:40.306\nyou can do it and we will work for you or\n\n235\n00:12:40.306 --> 00:12:45.327\nyou can choose Select existing certificate\nand that is the one that we want.\n\n236\n00:12:45.327 --> 00:12:49.433\nNow the problem that we have is gonna\nbe a little bit unusual here cuz this\n\n237\n00:12:49.433 --> 00:12:53.334\nis something that tripped me up\nthe first time I did it, too is that,\n\n238\n00:12:53.334 --> 00:12:55.473\nlet me see if I can find where I put it.\n\n239\n00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.310\nI stored it some place safe here.\n\n240\n00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.510\n&gt;&gt; Your certificate?\n\n241\n00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.160\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so there we go, okay so\n\n242\n00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.890\nthere's a couple of different ways\nthat you can get the certificate.\n\n243\n00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.300\nSo for example, the regular\ncertificate that I downloaded for\n\n244\n00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.980\nthe web server, Is this one, okay?\n\n245\n00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.210\nNow, it doesn't actually tell you much but\nI know that the extension for\n\n246\n00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.920\nthis is normally a .cer.\n\n247\n00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.960\nSo that encoding is something\nthat I put on the web server,\n\n248\n00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:29.550\nit accepted perfectly fine, and\nit's just the security certificate.\n\n249\n00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:36.470\nBut the one that I need though Is one\nthat actually ends in a .pfx, okay?\n\n250\n00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:41.280\nNow this one,\neven though it's saved as a p7b, it can be\n\n251\n00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:47.420\ntranslated into that pfx by\nthe remote desktop services, okay?\n\n252\n00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.400\nSo we need to actually\nfigure out something.\n\n253\n00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.970\nIf I go and look in that folder\n\n254\n00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:56.940\nthrough the remote desktop services\nby clicking on Select a Certificate.\n\n255\n00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.050\nAnd then right here we\nhave a couple of options.\n\n256\n00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.460\nNotice because I chose this second option\n\n257\n00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.130\nI just get to choose the digital\ncertificate, Browse.\n\n258\n00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:08.410\nAnd then if I look in that folder and\n\n259\n00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:12.420\nI don't see those certificates then\nI know that something is wrong.\n\n260\n00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:17.215\nNow you can kind of see that even though\nright here, it says DER Encoded Binary\n\n261\n00:14:17.215 --> 00:14:21.940\nx.509, it is filtered out to be a pfx.\n\n262\n00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.300\nIt says, that's what I'm looking for.\n\n263\n00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.000\nWell that certificate is\nnot going to show up.\n\n264\n00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.110\nSo if I click on the Shared Folder here,\n\n265\n00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.450\ncuz this where I stored I was just\ntrying to show you an example.\n\n266\n00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:35.540\nNotice mine shows up,\nokay, so that's good.\n\n267\n00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:39.020\nIf you can get it but,\nlet's say that you don't have that.\n\n268\n00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.640\nSo how in the world do you\nget it if don't have that?\n\n269\n00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.960\nAnd that is what we want\nto get to right here.\n\n270\n00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.150\nCuz I think this is important\ncuz sometimes you like me,\n\n271\n00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.910\nyou go, it should work, it's not working.\n\n272\n00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.210\nWhat do I need to do?\n\n273\n00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.700\nWell, if you ever have that situation\nwhere it's not like that, but\n\n274\n00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.890\nyou know that the certificate\nis there on the RDS server,\n\n275\n00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:59.310\nyou've already got the web server up and\n\n276\n00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:04.231\nyou've installed that certificate, you\ncan simply go to its management console.\n\n277\n00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:09.774\nFor the certificates here, I'm just\nstarting to type out certificates and\n\n278\n00:15:09.774 --> 00:15:12.899\nnotice where it says Manage\ncomputer certificates.\n\n279\n00:15:15.366 --> 00:15:18.506\nFrom here I'm going to click\ninto that Certificate Manager.\n\n280\n00:15:20.316 --> 00:15:24.253\nAnd then underneath Personal and\nCertificate,\n\n281\n00:15:24.253 --> 00:15:29.220\nnotice this is where it also\ninstalled it right here.\n\n282\n00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:34.320\nSo the one that I want of course is\nthe one that was issued by DC01, and\n\n283\n00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.680\nif I need that pfx one, okay, but I only\nhave the regular one that it installed.\n\n284\n00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.020\n&gt;&gt; I'm trying to think you\nhave to grab the footprint?\n\n285\n00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.759\n&gt;&gt; No, you don't need to do that,\njust right-click, go All Tasks and\n\n286\n00:15:45.759 --> 00:15:46.674\nthen Export it.\n\n287\n00:15:46.674 --> 00:15:48.140\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n288\n00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.130\n&gt;&gt; And once you export it\nhere in Windows Server 2012-\n\n289\n00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.360\n&gt;&gt; It gives you an option to reformat?\n\n290\n00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.488\n&gt;&gt; No, you don't have to reformat,\nbut you can say Yes.\n\n291\n00:15:54.488 --> 00:15:58.989\nYou don't have to export a private key but\nI'm going to just to do this point here.\n\n292\n00:15:58.989 --> 00:16:00.954\nBut now notice what it says.\n\n293\n00:16:00.954 --> 00:16:05.883\nSo it clipped out all the other options\nbut look at the extension here.\n\n294\n00:16:05.883 --> 00:16:08.989\nSo this is where it gives\nme that chance to do this.\n\n295\n00:16:08.989 --> 00:16:13.283\nSo now we can actually include everything\nor you can delete the private key,\n\n296\n00:16:13.283 --> 00:16:14.434\nyou can do all that.\n\n297\n00:16:14.434 --> 00:16:16.736\nI'm just gonna leave it as is for\nright now, okay?\n\n298\n00:16:16.736 --> 00:16:19.375\nSo that's how you can get that.\n\n299\n00:16:19.375 --> 00:16:22.500\nYou just need to make sure you save it\nsomewhere where you'll find it again.\n\n300\n00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.715\nIf you're like me,\nthat's kind of the hard part.\n\n301\n00:16:24.715 --> 00:16:25.544\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is remembering that.\n\n302\n00:16:25.544 --> 00:16:31.568\nSo once that's exported, that's when\nwe can come back into this one and\n\n303\n00:16:31.568 --> 00:16:33.957\nthen add that path in there.\n\n304\n00:16:33.957 --> 00:16:37.601\nNow the good thing is even though we've\ngot several things set up for us,\n\n305\n00:16:37.601 --> 00:16:39.354\nwe don't have everything set up.\n\n306\n00:16:39.354 --> 00:16:42.167\nBut I want to actually do it for\nat least a couple of things here.\n\n307\n00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:45.922\nSo the way that we do this, and we can\nonly install it at one role at a time,\n\n308\n00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:47.585\nis that we select, let's say,\n\n309\n00:16:47.585 --> 00:16:51.790\nthis enable single sign-on for\nserver to server authentication.\n\n310\n00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.500\nI click on select existing certificate.\n\n311\n00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.638\nIn the certification path,\n\n312\n00:16:55.638 --> 00:17:01.615\nI browse to the folder where I have just\nexported that particular certificate.\n\n313\n00:17:01.615 --> 00:17:02.670\n&gt;&gt; Wahoo.\n\n314\n00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.488\n&gt;&gt; So, I'm gonna select it and click open.\n\n315\n00:17:04.488 --> 00:17:10.448\nAnd now, when you save it as that PFX and\nyou also kept the private key,\n\n316\n00:17:10.448 --> 00:17:15.818\nit's gonna require you to add\na password in when you export it.\n\n317\n00:17:15.818 --> 00:17:16.318\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n318\n00:17:19.095 --> 00:17:21.969\n&gt;&gt; Then, I'm gonna allow it to save\nthat in it's trusted root authority.\n\n319\n00:17:21.969 --> 00:17:25.955\nClick OK, and then you have to hit Apply.\n\n320\n00:17:25.955 --> 00:17:29.294\nIt's not one of those where you can\njust go down to the next role and\n\n321\n00:17:29.294 --> 00:17:33.025\nthen do whatever you want to and\njust continue to add it in for every role.\n\n322\n00:17:33.025 --> 00:17:36.090\nAnd you might be wondering,\nwhy are they making you do this?\n\n323\n00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:39.222\nWell, one, if you chose to,\nif you decided to, you\n\n324\n00:17:39.222 --> 00:17:44.014\ncould actually put a different certificate\nname on each one of those services.\n\n325\n00:17:44.014 --> 00:17:48.503\nSo in other words, you could use\nthree different certificates or\n\n326\n00:17:48.503 --> 00:17:52.270\nfour different certificates\nif you wanted to, okay?\n\n327\n00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.470\nAll right, so good thing is,\n\n328\n00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:58.784\nthe first one that we actually\ndid says status is now okay.\n\n329\n00:17:58.784 --> 00:18:01.667\nNotice the level at this\npoint is now Trusted.\n\n330\n00:18:01.667 --> 00:18:06.280\nSo it says look, hey that internal\nCA works for me, we're good.\n\n331\n00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.040\nThe state is successful, okay?\n\n332\n00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:13.031\nNow if this were a real certificate\nthat was really valid somewhere out\n\n333\n00:18:13.031 --> 00:18:17.092\non the Internet, and\nthis can be now for my remote users,\n\n334\n00:18:17.092 --> 00:18:22.945\nlook at the subject name, and you can view\ndetails, of that certificate as well.\n\n335\n00:18:22.945 --> 00:18:26.455\nSo here you can see where-\n&gt;&gt; Thumbprint, I said footprint earlier.\n\n336\n00:18:26.455 --> 00:18:27.759\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's fine.\n\n337\n00:18:27.759 --> 00:18:29.457\nSo here it is.\n\n338\n00:18:29.457 --> 00:18:33.340\nYou can actually see the certificate\ndetails and that is now installed for\n\n339\n00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:34.390\nthat role.\n\n340\n00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:37.470\nSo now,\nthe remote connection broker can now say,\n\n341\n00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.520\nhey, here's the certificate that you're\ngonna be using to establish that.\n\n342\n00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.742\nIf I'm gonna be publishing apps,\nI'm gonna do the same thing.\n\n343\n00:18:43.742 --> 00:18:46.346\nSo I'm just gonna select this one.\n\n344\n00:18:46.346 --> 00:18:49.265\nAnd make sure I issue the password.\n\n345\n00:18:49.265 --> 00:18:49.891\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n346\n00:18:51.639 --> 00:18:54.715\n&gt;&gt; Oops,\nsometimes that zoom locks my mouse in.\n\n347\n00:18:57.661 --> 00:18:58.161\nNope, sometimes.\n\n348\n00:19:05.287 --> 00:19:08.896\n[LAUGH] I'm trying to get my mouse\nunlocked at this point, there we go.\n\n349\n00:19:08.896 --> 00:19:14.430\nSo there's the other one, and we'll\njust go ahead and, I have to apply it.\n\n350\n00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:16.694\nSo I have to always click Apply here.\n\n351\n00:19:16.694 --> 00:19:19.900\nSo now that we have that, and\nthat's all that we're seeing here,\n\n352\n00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.522\nit's that we continue to add in these\nroles and add in those certificates.\n\n353\n00:19:23.522 --> 00:19:28.293\nAt the end when I finish everything, what\nshould change of course is that the level\n\n354\n00:19:28.293 --> 00:19:33.750\nup here should go from not configured to,\nwell, trust it, is what it should happen.\n\n355\n00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.140\nSo that's all that we're doing right here.\n\n356\n00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:38.552\nNow once that's done, we can test\nthis thing out and see what happens.\n\n357\n00:19:38.552 --> 00:19:41.180\nSo let's see if I can get this done.\n\n358\n00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.630\nThere's no real quickness about it.\n\n359\n00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:45.949\nIt just takes its time, but\nmaybe I can be a little bit more efficient\n\n360\n00:19:52.783 --> 00:19:53.283\nAdd doing this.\n\n361\n00:19:57.779 --> 00:20:02.614\nAnd then clicking OK or Apply and\nwe'll see this in a moment here.\n\n362\n00:20:02.614 --> 00:20:06.707\nSo we've got one more role and we want to\nmake sure that what we see here at the end\n\n363\n00:20:06.707 --> 00:20:09.270\nis of course where it turns\nto Trusted as the key.\n\n364\n00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.081\n&gt;&gt; Cool we're half way there.\n\n365\n00:20:10.081 --> 00:20:15.470\n&gt;&gt; Yep, once that's done, if you did go\nand do a standard deployment instead.\n\n366\n00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:17.249\nAt the end,\nthis is where you would go in and\n\n367\n00:20:17.249 --> 00:20:19.134\ncreate your new session collection, okay?\n\n368\n00:20:19.134 --> 00:20:22.214\nAnd that way you can publish your\napps the way that you want to, and\n\n369\n00:20:22.214 --> 00:20:24.852\nit should come across, and\neverything should be good.\n\n370\n00:20:24.852 --> 00:20:30.610\nLet me select this last time here and\nget this one set up and ready to go.\n\n371\n00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.170\nAnd click Apply.\n\n372\n00:20:37.885 --> 00:20:38.764\nOops, I forgot the password.\n\n373\n00:20:38.764 --> 00:20:40.832\nThat's probably why\nit's not gonna do that.\n\n374\n00:20:40.832 --> 00:20:42.624\nSo it's gonna have to error out here for\na moment.\n\n375\n00:20:42.624 --> 00:20:44.475\nSo I forgot to push\nthe password as the key.\n\n376\n00:20:48.721 --> 00:20:50.874\nI'm trying to get fast and\nshouldn't have hurried.\n\n377\n00:20:57.427 --> 00:20:59.778\nSo in just a moment we should\nsee everything change here.\n\n378\n00:20:59.778 --> 00:21:04.976\nAnd now we should have all the details\nup and success and Trusted.\n\n379\n00:21:04.976 --> 00:21:09.770\nAnd now notice that right here at\nthe top it says current deployment level\n\n380\n00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.743\ncertificate now is Trusted.\n\n381\n00:21:11.743 --> 00:21:13.622\nEverything is successful and\n\n382\n00:21:13.622 --> 00:21:16.788\nthat is pretty much all\nthat we really want to see.\n\n383\n00:21:16.788 --> 00:21:17.426\n&gt;&gt; Great.\n\n384\n00:21:17.426 --> 00:21:20.118\n&gt;&gt; So now that everything is done,\n\n385\n00:21:20.118 --> 00:21:26.520\nwe have our quick session collection\nthat everything is ready to go.\n\n386\n00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.664\nRemember before,\nwhen we selected the client and\n\n387\n00:21:28.664 --> 00:21:30.306\nwe saw that red bar on the address bar?\n\n388\n00:21:30.306 --> 00:21:31.490\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n389\n00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.726\n&gt;&gt; In theory, I have to,\nagain, always do my if, right?\n\n390\n00:21:33.726 --> 00:21:35.816\nThat if I have set this\nup correctly now and\n\n391\n00:21:35.816 --> 00:21:38.386\neverything is installed\nthe way that it should be,\n\n392\n00:21:38.386 --> 00:21:42.065\nI should be able to go there and\nthat red bar shouldn't be there anymore.\n\n393\n00:21:42.065 --> 00:21:45.045\nSo unless I've done something wrong,\nwhich is very possible,\n\n394\n00:21:45.045 --> 00:21:48.813\nbecause I always never think about stuff\nlike this, this is what should happen.\n\n395\n00:21:48.813 --> 00:21:52.685\nNow, where might you still get a red bar\neven if you set up everything correctly?\n\n396\n00:21:52.685 --> 00:21:55.091\nIt depends on the host here, okay?\n\n397\n00:21:55.091 --> 00:21:56.220\nIt depends on the client.\n\n398\n00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.904\nNow, the reason why I want\nto mention that, right,\n\n399\n00:21:58.904 --> 00:22:02.321\nis because if that particular\nmachine is not joined to the domain,\n\n400\n00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:06.247\nit's still gonna say, I don't know\nwhere your trusted root authority is.\n\n401\n00:22:06.247 --> 00:22:07.929\nSo how do we do that?\n\n402\n00:22:07.929 --> 00:22:10.850\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at this one, okay?\n\n403\n00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:14.050\nSo on this machine,\nI went ahead and did this earlier.\n\n404\n00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:18.620\nBut the way that we would do that right on\na Windows 7 machine is we'd go to our task\n\n405\n00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:19.238\nmanager.\n\n406\n00:22:19.238 --> 00:22:23.067\nNow I'm on this thin PC which doesn't just\ngive me the command prompt to do this, so\n\n407\n00:22:23.067 --> 00:22:25.217\nthat's why I have to go\nthrough task manager.\n\n408\n00:22:25.217 --> 00:22:32.662\nI can then select new task, here,\nopen up a Microsoft Management Console.\n\n409\n00:22:39.334 --> 00:22:40.389\nMake sure I say yes to that.\n\n410\n00:22:40.389 --> 00:22:46.562\nAnd then select File, Add or\nRemove snap-in certificates.\n\n411\n00:22:46.562 --> 00:22:49.227\nThen do this for the computer account.\n\n412\n00:22:49.227 --> 00:22:53.051\nAnd I'm on the local computer.\n\n413\n00:22:53.051 --> 00:22:58.643\nClick OK, and\nnow I will have that particular\n\n414\n00:22:58.643 --> 00:23:03.654\ncertificate manager for this machine.\n\n415\n00:23:03.654 --> 00:23:07.504\nWhat I want to make sure of\nare a couple of things here, okay?\n\n416\n00:23:07.504 --> 00:23:11.514\nYou'll notice that in the Personal\nthere's nothing, but it's right here.\n\n417\n00:23:11.514 --> 00:23:15.625\nThat we would need to make sure\nthat we would have our root\n\n418\n00:23:15.625 --> 00:23:18.427\ncertificate authority here, okay?\n\n419\n00:23:18.427 --> 00:23:21.960\nIf it's not there,\nyou'll still get the red bar, okay?\n\n420\n00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:26.469\nSo that means you'd have to export the\nroot certificate to actually be placed on\n\n421\n00:23:26.469 --> 00:23:27.493\nthose machines.\n\n422\n00:23:27.493 --> 00:23:30.842\nNow, if you're joining it to a domain,\nit'll be there.\n\n423\n00:23:30.842 --> 00:23:33.140\nIf you're not,\nit means you do have to export it and\n\n424\n00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:36.410\nthen you import it directly in here and\nthen you'll be up and ready to go.\n\n425\n00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:40.634\nSo that's just another hint if you end\nup having issues like that, all right so\n\n426\n00:23:40.634 --> 00:23:41.918\nnow that that's done.\n\n427\n00:23:41.918 --> 00:23:45.593\nLet's check if out and\nsee if I've done anything wrong.\n\n428\n00:23:45.593 --> 00:23:46.245\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n429\n00:23:46.245 --> 00:23:47.919\n&gt;&gt; It is very possible, like I said.\n\n430\n00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:51.331\nSo once we get the web\nbrowser coming up here.\n\n431\n00:23:51.331 --> 00:23:56.147\nAnd also of course remember, that even\nthough this particular machine is not\n\n432\n00:23:56.147 --> 00:24:00.606\nupdated, you should always run your\nlatest browser that's updated.\n\n433\n00:24:00.606 --> 00:24:07.565\nAs well, and then select httpsrd01,\n\n434\n00:24:07.565 --> 00:24:14.122\noops, itprotvdemo.com and rdweb.\n\n435\n00:24:14.122 --> 00:24:16.825\nMake sure we can see that.\n\n436\n00:24:16.825 --> 00:24:21.251\nSo this is that same URL\nthat we saw when we first\n\n437\n00:24:21.251 --> 00:24:25.232\ncreated that quick session collection.\n\n438\n00:24:25.232 --> 00:24:27.340\nRight at the bottom when\neverything was done.\n\n439\n00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:30.100\nThat said, here's how you\nconnect in to do everything.\n\n440\n00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.180\nSo once we have that, press Enter.\n\n441\n00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.990\nAnd now notice,\nlet's take a look here, Cherokee, and\n\n442\n00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:41.860\nsee if this was done\nthe way that it should be.\n\n443\n00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:45.030\nI can visibly see something different,\nCherokee, right up at the top.\n\n444\n00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:45.810\nWhat about you?\n\n445\n00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:48.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't see that notification or\nthat error message and\n\n446\n00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.090\nI see my little lock.\n\n447\n00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, so, we select that\nlittle that little lock, right?\n\n448\n00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.135\nNow, we can see the website\nidentification.\n\n449\n00:24:55.135 --> 00:24:58.420\nWell, let me see if I can select it,\nzoom in a little bit.\n\n450\n00:24:58.420 --> 00:24:59.070\nHere it is.\n\n451\n00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:01.960\nIt says hey, look,\nthe root certificate authority\n\n452\n00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:06.140\nhas actually said that this site\nis the one that we want, okay.\n\n453\n00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:10.134\nSo that shows us that we are,\nat least, on the right track so far.\n\n454\n00:25:10.134 --> 00:25:11.165\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n455\n00:25:11.165 --> 00:25:12.084\n&gt;&gt; Hey Ronnie, we trust you.\n\n456\n00:25:12.084 --> 00:25:13.173\n&gt;&gt; So there you go, there you go.\n\n457\n00:25:13.173 --> 00:25:14.752\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And here it is again.\n\n458\n00:25:14.752 --> 00:25:17.290\nHere's the entire certificate\nthat you can see.\n\n459\n00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:19.280\nThis certificate is intended for\nthe following purpose,\n\n460\n00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.160\nensures the identity of\nthe remote computer.\n\n461\n00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.832\nThat's exactly what we\nwant to help us out here.\n\n462\n00:25:25.832 --> 00:25:34.098\nSo at this point I should be\nable to do itprotvdemo\\user01.\n\n463\n00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.683\nType in my super secret password.\n\n464\n00:25:38.683 --> 00:25:39.970\nIf I typed it in correctly.\n\n465\n00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:44.572\nAnd now notice that now that I've switched\nin, the certificate is still there, so\n\n466\n00:25:44.572 --> 00:25:46.822\nwe know that everything is now working.\n\n467\n00:25:46.822 --> 00:25:50.708\nAnd each one of these\nconnections now also,\n\n468\n00:25:50.708 --> 00:25:54.183\nnotice instead of what we saw earlier.\n\n469\n00:25:54.183 --> 00:25:58.131\nWhich was kind of this kind of big\nyellow and grey box looking thing.\n\n470\n00:25:58.131 --> 00:26:02.317\nAnd that's because all this information up\nat the top was in yellow or in the gray,\n\n471\n00:26:02.317 --> 00:26:03.844\nI can't remember which one.\n\n472\n00:26:03.844 --> 00:26:07.664\nBut it was telling us, Publisher,\nwe don't know who published it.\n\n473\n00:26:07.664 --> 00:26:11.308\nIt says Unknown at the top if you look at\nthe previous episode when we showed you\n\n474\n00:26:11.308 --> 00:26:12.215\nthis connection.\n\n475\n00:26:12.215 --> 00:26:14.989\nNow notice it says,\nyeah I know exactly who this is,\n\n476\n00:26:14.989 --> 00:26:18.786\nI know who that remote server is,\nI can actually identify everything.\n\n477\n00:26:18.786 --> 00:26:21.688\nAnd that's exactly what\nyou're hoping to see.\n\n478\n00:26:21.688 --> 00:26:26.566\nSame thing here, so it's no longer that\nbig kind of gray thing that you saw,\n\n479\n00:26:26.566 --> 00:26:28.730\nand there was a yellow portion.\n\n480\n00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:30.820\nI can't remember which one,\nwhich side it was, but\n\n481\n00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.350\nyou'll actually end up seeing that.\n\n482\n00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:37.864\nSo that gives you the now, the ability to\nunderstand that we have used the actual\n\n483\n00:26:37.864 --> 00:26:43.690\ncertificates to secure our connection\ngoing in and doing everything else.\n\n484\n00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:46.810\nNow once all that's done,\nright, why is that important?\n\n485\n00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:48.750\nThat's what we've gotta\nactually think about.\n\n486\n00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:53.210\nWell, now all of these connections\nare now using what, port 443, okay.\n\n487\n00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:54.821\nSo what does this do for a firewall?\n\n488\n00:26:54.821 --> 00:26:59.697\nIt means I don't have to worry\nabout opening up 3389 anymore.\n\n489\n00:26:59.697 --> 00:27:04.352\nBecause this will now go over\nport 443 using an SSL connection.\n\n490\n00:27:04.352 --> 00:27:06.802\nAnd we're up and we're ready to go.\n\n491\n00:27:06.802 --> 00:27:11.454\nSo on those particular places where\nfirewall issues are of issue we don't\n\n492\n00:27:11.454 --> 00:27:14.990\nreally wanna allow 3389 to come through.\n\n493\n00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:17.095\nYou go, okay.\nHere's another solution for us and\n\n494\n00:27:17.095 --> 00:27:19.280\nnow we'll send everything\nover that instead.\n\n495\n00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.834\nAnd that's actually a great type of way\nthat we're not enlarging any security\n\n496\n00:27:23.834 --> 00:27:26.119\nvulnerabilities there by doing that.\n\n497\n00:27:26.119 --> 00:27:29.457\n&gt;&gt; And we're providing mutual\nauthentication for both parties involved,\n\n498\n00:27:29.457 --> 00:27:30.651\nso a win win for everyone.\n\n499\n00:27:30.651 --> 00:27:32.905\n&gt;&gt; And so this is why you want to do this.\n\n500\n00:27:32.905 --> 00:27:37.803\nNow the easier setup, right,\n[LAUGH] third party certificate.\n\n501\n00:27:37.803 --> 00:27:38.908\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie didn't take that route.\n\n502\n00:27:38.908 --> 00:27:43.046\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, third party certificate,\nnow I'm not saying you can't do this,\n\n503\n00:27:43.046 --> 00:27:44.056\njust like I said.\n\n504\n00:27:44.056 --> 00:27:47.260\nBut it does require you to\nhave a bit of knowledge.\n\n505\n00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:51.311\nOr you have to depend on somebody\nelse to get the thing set up for you.\n\n506\n00:27:51.311 --> 00:27:54.597\nSo, if you're working for a company,\nand they say, yeah, so, of course,\n\n507\n00:27:54.597 --> 00:27:55.538\nCherokee can do this.\n\n508\n00:27:55.538 --> 00:27:59.576\nAnd Cherokee's, okay,\nsure, and that's fine.\n\n509\n00:27:59.576 --> 00:28:01.562\nAnd I'm pretty sure Cherokee can.\n\n510\n00:28:01.562 --> 00:28:04.109\nBut, if you were to ask Ronnie,\nthere are some times when he might go.\n\n511\n00:28:04.109 --> 00:28:08.000\nAll right, we are gonna figure this out,\nbut you have to figure it out.\n\n512\n00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.790\nSo it has to be testable\njust like what we did here.\n\n513\n00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.210\nEverything has to be a working solution.\n\n514\n00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:17.335\nThe other thing you have to realize of\ncourse is make sure you understand the age\n\n515\n00:28:17.335 --> 00:28:19.475\nlimits on of course your certificates.\n\n516\n00:28:19.475 --> 00:28:22.961\nAnd is there a certificate\nrevocation list, all that stuff.\n\n517\n00:28:22.961 --> 00:28:23.691\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n518\n00:28:23.691 --> 00:28:25.758\n&gt;&gt; That again goes back to\nthe certificate authority.\n\n519\n00:28:25.758 --> 00:28:28.267\n&gt;&gt; And that encoding too because\nI know you were talking about it.\n\n520\n00:28:28.267 --> 00:28:28.826\n&gt;&gt; Encoding, yep.\n\n521\n00:28:28.826 --> 00:28:30.171\n&gt;&gt; And\nI've had an issue with that before and\n\n522\n00:28:30.171 --> 00:28:31.565\nI couldn't remember how it was resolved.\n\n523\n00:28:31.565 --> 00:28:34.143\nFor some reason I was thinking it\nwas something to do that thumbprint.\n\n524\n00:28:34.143 --> 00:28:35.562\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; But that might have been another story.\n\n525\n00:28:35.562 --> 00:28:36.642\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Another issue.\n\n526\n00:28:36.642 --> 00:28:37.626\n[LAUGH] But yeah.\n\n527\n00:28:37.626 --> 00:28:42.558\n&gt;&gt; But overall though that's how we get\nto be a complete secured connection.\n\n528\n00:28:42.558 --> 00:28:45.858\nSo we showed you pretty much\nend to end security, right?\n\n529\n00:28:45.858 --> 00:28:50.133\nThe very fact that even on my\nmachines inside of my network,\n\n530\n00:28:50.133 --> 00:28:52.533\nthe ones that do remote desktop.\n\n531\n00:28:52.533 --> 00:28:58.162\nI don't want to request the certificate\nover an unsecured connection.\n\n532\n00:28:58.162 --> 00:29:00.113\nSo that was the first thing that we did.\n\n533\n00:29:00.113 --> 00:29:04.793\nWhich was to get a certificate to\nthe web browser that was running\n\n534\n00:29:04.793 --> 00:29:07.490\nthe certificate authority, okay.\n\n535\n00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:08.860\nThat's the first thing and\n\n536\n00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.870\nthen secondly, now being able\nto connect securely on that.\n\n537\n00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:17.050\nThat requires you to be\nable to configure on INS.\n\n538\n00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:19.950\nSo that's way outside the scope\nof what we're doing here.\n\n539\n00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:20.913\nWe showed you a little bit of it.\n\n540\n00:29:20.913 --> 00:29:25.010\nBut then at that point you have to do\nthe same thing with the remote desktop\n\n541\n00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:26.027\ngateway server.\n\n542\n00:29:26.027 --> 00:29:30.420\nWhich is the one that I'm on or the one\nthat I was on configuring everything.\n\n543\n00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.252\nAnd then you also have to put\nthe certificates in each of those role\n\n544\n00:29:33.252 --> 00:29:34.759\nservices to make sure that works.\n\n545\n00:29:34.759 --> 00:29:38.194\nAnd that the certificate\nformat may be different and\n\n546\n00:29:38.194 --> 00:29:41.482\nthat's why you might not\nfind that certificate.\n\n547\n00:29:41.482 --> 00:29:44.571\nEverything that I've showed you\nessentially is a pitfall that I've\n\n548\n00:29:44.571 --> 00:29:47.242\nran into that I don't want you\nto have to actually run into.\n\n549\n00:29:47.242 --> 00:29:49.016\nAnd that's why I also showed it to you.\n\n550\n00:29:49.016 --> 00:29:50.980\nSo just think about this idea.\n\n551\n00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:54.796\nIf you want to do this the easier method,\na little bit more expensive but\n\n552\n00:29:54.796 --> 00:29:58.114\nprobably worth the time,\nthird party certificates, okay.\n\n553\n00:29:58.114 --> 00:30:00.494\nThe harder method is exactly this one.\n\n554\n00:30:00.494 --> 00:30:03.421\nBut you can learn a lot in terms\nof certificate services and\n\n555\n00:30:03.421 --> 00:30:06.843\nhow to get everything working and\nenrolled the way that you want to.\n\n556\n00:30:06.843 --> 00:30:10.398\nBut at the same time, you actually notice\nthat it did take a bit of time to set up\n\n557\n00:30:10.398 --> 00:30:11.840\nand get everything rolling.\n\n558\n00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.928\nBut now you have a complete secured\nconnection to your remote desktop\n\n559\n00:30:15.928 --> 00:30:16.880\nservices.\n\n560\n00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.970\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie, we do appreciate that\nextra time that you spent to show us\n\n561\n00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:22.160\nthrough that longer process,\nthe more difficult path.\n\n562\n00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.810\nBecause we might get stuck\nin that situation one day.\n\n563\n00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:26.380\nSo thank you so much for that.\n\n564\n00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.250\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for tuning in.\n\n565\n00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:31.671\nBut stay tuned, we have more remote\ndesktop services headed your way.\n\n566\n00:30:31.671 --> 00:30:33.689\nI am going to go ahead and\nsign off as your show host.\n\n567\n00:30:33.689 --> 00:30:34.640\nI'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n568\n00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.535\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.100\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your Remote Desktop Services\nshow, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n4\n00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.800\nIn the previous episode we\nconfigured a secure connection, but\n\n5\n00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.276\nwe still have some configuring left to do.\n\n6\n00:00:22.276 --> 00:00:23.511\nWith us today, we have Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:26.421\nRonnie Wong in studios, thank you for\njoining us today Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:26.421 --> 00:00:29.404\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back\non the Remote Desktop Services show.\n\n9\n00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:33.122\nAnd we do have a little bit more\nthat we need to zoom in on and\n\n10\n00:00:33.122 --> 00:00:34.757\nget configured as well.\n\n11\n00:00:34.757 --> 00:00:38.278\nRemember that in our set up so far,\nCherokee, as we did these kinda,\n\n12\n00:00:38.278 --> 00:00:42.713\nsingle server deployment idea, that we did\nshow you that when you select that option,\n\n13\n00:00:42.713 --> 00:00:45.475\nit automatically sets up\nthose three roles, right.\n\n14\n00:00:45.475 --> 00:00:49.279\nThe gateway, the web access and\nthe session host,\n\n15\n00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:52.390\nthose are configured in the background.\n\n16\n00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.500\nYou and I really don't have to touch them,\n\n17\n00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.770\nexcept to change maybe the publishing app\nand of course the add-in certificates.\n\n18\n00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.270\nAnd we've seen all that before, and\nthat everything is kind of up and going.\n\n19\n00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.420\nBut there are a couple of other roles\nin which I just simply added in, just\n\n20\n00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.080\nto show you that we could, to make sure\nthat they're a part of the deployment.\n\n21\n00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.340\nBut we really didn't do anything\nwith them, I just kind of said,\n\n22\n00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.360\nwe're gonna hit that another show,\nwe're gonna hit that another show.\n\n23\n00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.550\nWell today is that time that we\nare gonna hit that in that other show.\n\n24\n00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.550\nAnd so this is where we are, and\nwe wanna take a look specifically,\n\n25\n00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.770\nthen, at some of the options and\nconfigurations we need to consider\n\n26\n00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.950\nif we're gonna really implement\nRemote Desktop, right.\n\n27\n00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.748\nNot only, of course, for\ninternal users, but for external users.\n\n28\n00:01:36.748 --> 00:01:38.804\nAnd that's what we're gonna focus in on,\n\n29\n00:01:38.804 --> 00:01:42.985\nof course, configuring the Remote Desktop\nGateway, and why that one's important.\n\n30\n00:01:42.985 --> 00:01:44.525\nThe other thing, of course,\n\n31\n00:01:44.525 --> 00:01:48.570\nis the Remote Desktop licensing role\nthat we also need to configure.\n\n32\n00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.300\nCurrently even though everything is\nrunning, and everything is good,\n\n33\n00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.120\nwe saw where the certificate\nissued out perfectly fine.\n\n34\n00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.099\nAnd we're able to make\nthe connection that we need to.\n\n35\n00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:02.950\nThe issue that we have is still simple,\nwithout licensing I have a limitation, and\n\n36\n00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.293\nthat limitation to that one\nserver has two connections.\n\n37\n00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:11.328\nAnd as great as that is, two whole\nconnections is probably not sufficient for\n\n38\n00:02:11.328 --> 00:02:14.380\nany particular business's real need.\n\n39\n00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.240\nFor a user at home probably okay, but\nthat's a lot of infrastructure set up for\n\n40\n00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.720\njust a user at home to have\ntwo additional connections.\n\n41\n00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.890\nIt really would be,\nif you did all that for\n\n42\n00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.940\ntwo connections, well you are a gung-ho\nenthusiast on Windows Server 2012, and\n\n43\n00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.300\nyou're beyond an enthusiast at that point.\n\n44\n00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.750\nBut normally, most of us are doing this so\n\n45\n00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.220\nthat we actually can have the ability\nto provide this type of connection or\n\n46\n00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.970\naccess to the applications in our network\nfor multiple users at the same time.\n\n47\n00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.310\nSo we need to configure\nthe licensing side too,\n\n48\n00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.080\nand that's what we're also gonna\ntake a look at in this episode.\n\n49\n00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.320\nAnd that may take us a few minutes as\nwe've gotta get a couple of connections\n\n50\n00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.160\ndown and do a couple of different\nthings to make that one work.\n\n51\n00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.080\nBut let's start off by talking\nabout this IDM of setting up\n\n52\n00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.040\nthe Remote Desktop Gateway\nis what we want to do.\n\n53\n00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.160\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie ,why is\nthe Remote Desktop Gateway important?\n\n54\n00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.290\nAnd what is the function and its\npurpose relating to this configuration?\n\n55\n00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.990\n&gt;&gt; Well, when it comes down to it,\n\n56\n00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.040\nbecause all the tests that I've been\ndoing right now, we pretty much only\n\n57\n00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.900\nbeen entering in the fully qualified\ndomain name of that server.\n\n58\n00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.420\nWhere the web server resides,\nwhere the remote access server resides.\n\n59\n00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.360\nAnd that's because I know it right then\nand there, and everything is good.\n\n60\n00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.180\nBut if we were to try and connect to\nit from the internet at this point.\n\n61\n00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.510\nWell, it has to maybe go through\nother things that are out there.\n\n62\n00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.190\nAnd the problem that we have is that we\ndon't really wanna put that Remote Desktop\n\n63\n00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.270\nmachine, that we've got\neverything set up on,\n\n64\n00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.410\nright at there at the edge\nof our network yard.\n\n65\n00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.690\nBut there may be a point when we do,\n\n66\n00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.010\nwhen we actually separate\nthat roll out by itself.\n\n67\n00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.035\nAnd we say if you are going to be\nusing Remote Desktop Services,\n\n68\n00:03:59.035 --> 00:04:01.630\nyou're gonna connect through that machine.\n\n69\n00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.830\nAnd that's what that\nRemote Desktop Gateway does for us.\n\n70\n00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:05.560\nIt provides for\n\n71\n00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.220\nus an entry point to be able to get access\nto those network resources that we want\n\n72\n00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.750\npeople to get access to,\neven from outside of our network.\n\n73\n00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.450\nNow you might be wondering\nis that really important?\n\n74\n00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.000\nWell, in today's world,\nit's as important as anything else.\n\n75\n00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.580\nWe don't want the limitation\nanymore of having what we call\n\n76\n00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.100\na bounded type of network.\n\n77\n00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.290\nWhere we can't access our resources when\nwe do, or we need to set up additional\n\n78\n00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.590\nthings so that we can do that,\neven when I'm not out there, or\n\n79\n00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.602\nwhen I'm not directly connected\ninside of my network.\n\n80\n00:04:36.602 --> 00:04:40.220\nSo the Remote Desktop Gateway is,\nfirst and foremost, right,\n\n81\n00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.575\nthe connection point that we need,\nit's our presence out on the Internet for\n\n82\n00:04:44.575 --> 00:04:46.728\nthe Remote Desktop Services, okay.\n\n83\n00:04:46.728 --> 00:04:51.349\nSecondly though, we also need\nit to be a secured connection.\n\n84\n00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:53.915\nAnd the problem that we have, once again,\n\n85\n00:04:53.915 --> 00:04:58.140\nis now there's a couple of options\nthat are also in our way too, okay.\n\n86\n00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.813\nOne of those, of course, is security, the\nidea of security here is very important\n\n87\n00:05:03.813 --> 00:05:09.710\nto everybody on the planet as far as\ngetting the resources that we need to.\n\n88\n00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.410\nIf this Remote Desktop Server and\nservices is behind a firewall,\n\n89\n00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.500\nwell remember what that means, that every\ntime somebody connects in they have to be\n\n90\n00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.620\nable to get through the firewall using,\nwell, a Remote Desktop connection.\n\n91\n00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.390\nAnd when they do something like that,\n\n92\n00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.120\nthat's usually not a port that's\nstandardly turned on by every firewall.\n\n93\n00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.755\nThey're saying, if you want that to\nhappen, you need to make an exception for,\n\n94\n00:05:33.755 --> 00:05:35.980\nwell, RDP to connect in.\n\n95\n00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.560\nAnd as much as you go well, okay, that's\nonly one app, but that's where people\n\n96\n00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.540\nstart having those security policies\nthat say, look we don't want to do this,\n\n97\n00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.280\nwe want to make sure that here's\nthe security that we allowed to com in.\n\n98\n00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.970\nBut we really don't wan to turn\non RDP if we don't need to.\n\n99\n00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.880\nSo, how do we get around something like\nthat if that's gonna be the truth and\n\n100\n00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.240\nthe nature of things?\n\n101\n00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.650\nAnd that's where we added in\ncertificates to help us out too.\n\n102\n00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.080\nThe advantage of using\nthe Remote Desktop Gateway and\n\n103\n00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.590\nproviding that single point of entry is\nthat it really prevents us from even,\n\n104\n00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.670\nnot only having to go across 3389,\nbut we can go across SSL using 4443.\n\n105\n00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.580\nBut secondly,\nwe don't even have to provide\n\n106\n00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.540\nanother way to get around all that\nby using VPNs anymore either.\n\n107\n00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.200\nSo if you have this set up,\neven a VPN connection is not necessary for\n\n108\n00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.660\npeople to get a secure connection in to\nthe services that you want them to have.\n\n109\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.320\nSo that's why setting that one up\nis actually a very important aspect\n\n110\n00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.560\nof everything that we want.\n\n111\n00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.880\nSo there's pretty much that,\nbut those are kind of benefits,\n\n112\n00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.360\nthose are the reasons\nwhy we wanna set it up.\n\n113\n00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.790\nAnd that's the key, all right, so let's\ntake a look at what we've done so far and\n\n114\n00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.090\nthen we'll go into the configuration.\n\n115\n00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.210\nThis is tricky,\nin the sense that it's not exactly where\n\n116\n00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.860\nI expected to find the configuration for\nit, which is unusual.\n\n117\n00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.470\nSo let's take a look at my screen.\n\n118\n00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.480\nI've got Server Manager opened up and\nthroughout the entire series we've\n\n119\n00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.140\npretty much been using the Server Manager\nto help us to configure everything.\n\n120\n00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.296\nSo if I select Remote Desktop Services\nhere, there it is again,\n\n121\n00:07:06.296 --> 00:07:08.519\nI'm getting this notice that says,\n\n122\n00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:13.260\nhey, look there is no Remote Desktop\nConnection Broker in this pool.\n\n123\n00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.125\nHow in the world are you gonna manage\nanything if you don't have that?\n\n124\n00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:20.476\nSo I click on Servers,\nI now select Manage, and add server in,\n\n125\n00:07:20.476 --> 00:07:24.665\nI'm going to allow it to search\nthrough active directory and\n\n126\n00:07:24.665 --> 00:07:27.228\nfind the servers that I wanna add in.\n\n127\n00:07:27.228 --> 00:07:30.810\nAnd I simply add in both, you only\nhave to add in the one that you need.\n\n128\n00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.490\nBut I always feel better about adding\nboth of them in, just in case.\n\n129\n00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.590\nSo that's just a personal thing, don't\nthink well, this is what Ronnie says.\n\n130\n00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.662\nAnd somebody's gonna definitely say, well,\n\n131\n00:07:40.662 --> 00:07:43.180\nRonnie's silly in wanting\nto do that every time.\n\n132\n00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.305\nBut that's the way I am, all right.\n\n133\n00:07:44.305 --> 00:07:46.920\nNow if I click back on it,\nI now have the overview, and\n\n134\n00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.293\nyou'll see here in a moment where\neverything is not populating yet,\n\n135\n00:07:50.293 --> 00:07:53.690\nin a moment everything will populate\nout in the way that we want it to.\n\n136\n00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.990\nAnd this is what happens,\nso in the previous episode,\n\n137\n00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.576\nI simply took that green plus sign,\nI right clicked on it and\n\n138\n00:08:00.576 --> 00:08:04.768\ntold it to go ahead and install or\nto configure that particular role.\n\n139\n00:08:04.768 --> 00:08:06.952\nAnd it did it, but\nwe didn't do anything else with it,\n\n140\n00:08:06.952 --> 00:08:08.957\nthe same thing with\nthe licensing server as well.\n\n141\n00:08:08.957 --> 00:08:12.685\nBut that's all that we did here,\nokay is that we just simply did that and\n\n142\n00:08:12.685 --> 00:08:16.330\nI left it alone and\nI didn't do anything else with it, okay.\n\n143\n00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.390\nSo at this point,\nhow do I know it's actually working and\n\n144\n00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.880\nconfigured and\ndoing everything that I want it to do?\n\n145\n00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:29.310\nYou don't because the reason why is that\nit has some default configuration on it.\n\n146\n00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:34.310\nSo we know it can work in stuff like\nthat., but what if I need to change that?\n\n147\n00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:36.520\nHow do I know what the configurations are?\n\n148\n00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.410\nAnd that's something you have to discover.\n\n149\n00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:42.030\nSo Cherokee, if you were to look\nat something like this, right?\n\n150\n00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.180\nAnd you'll go, all right so\nlet's get to configuring it, okay?\n\n151\n00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.500\nYou would kinda think that hey,\nit's simple right?\n\n152\n00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.645\nHere's a nice little icon.\n\n153\n00:08:49.645 --> 00:08:51.480\n&gt;&gt; Click on the icon that they provided.\n\n154\n00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, click on the icon you provided.\n\n155\n00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.441\nAnd I'm-\n&gt;&gt; Makes sense from a user\n\n156\n00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:55.670\ncentric UI, right?\n\n157\n00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm clicking on it and\nguess what?\n\n158\n00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.280\n&gt;&gt; Nada?\n\n159\n00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.400\n&gt;&gt; Nothing's happening, okay?\n\n160\n00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n161\n00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.330\nmy next thought is,\nright-click on it, all right?\n\n162\n00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.700\nWell, look at that,\nit says I can add one and\n\n163\n00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.260\nI can remove one, but-\n&gt;&gt; Configuring one.\n\n164\n00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.140\n&gt;&gt; Configuring one is not actually there.\n\n165\n00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.720\nSo that doesn't give me\nthe access that I want.\n\n166\n00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.640\nSo where in the world do\nwe go to configure this?\n\n167\n00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.490\nNow if those of you that don't that's\neasy, Ronnie, I've been doing this for\n\n168\n00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.160\nyears, I know exactly where.\n\n169\n00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.430\nRemember not everybody that's watching\nthis show might actually know\n\n170\n00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.120\nwhere to go and configure this.\n\n171\n00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.940\nSo that is our first hunt,\nis where do we go to configure this.\n\n172\n00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.820\nWell, this is where it\nbecomes a little bit stranger\n\n173\n00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:43.020\nin the very fact that you have to go back\nto servers up here on the left hand side.\n\n174\n00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:47.360\nAnd now you have to remember which\nparticular one of these servers\n\n175\n00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.840\nthat role was installed on, okay.\n\n176\n00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:56.060\nSo if I right click on RD01,\nnow you'll notice that\n\n177\n00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:01.670\nthere it is, the RD Gateway Manager is\nwhere that one's actually connected to.\n\n178\n00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.190\nNow there's a couple of\nthings that can happen.\n\n179\n00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.200\nSo for instance,\nif I right-click on this one,\n\n180\n00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.160\nI'm on DC1, at least that's where\nI'm consoled into here is DC01.\n\n181\n00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:18.481\nIf I select RD Gateway Manager [SOUND]\nI failed again Cherokee look at that.\n\n182\n00:10:18.481 --> 00:10:22.120\nServer Manager cannot open the tool.\n\n183\n00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.701\nYeah, there it is,\nI'm kind of toast, I am done.\n\n184\n00:10:25.701 --> 00:10:28.284\nAnd now it says, Ronnie,\nif you wanna do this,\n\n185\n00:10:28.284 --> 00:10:31.710\nyou gotta add in a bunch of\nother stuff to make it work.\n\n186\n00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:32.980\nBoy, that sounds neat.\n\n187\n00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.513\n&gt;&gt; Or can we just switch\nover to the other machine?\n\n188\n00:10:34.513 --> 00:10:35.801\n[INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly what you'll do.\n\n189\n00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:40.450\n[LAUGH] So I'm just trying to show\nyou there are things that you\n\n190\n00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.197\nfeel like You get on a roll, right?\n\n191\n00:10:43.197 --> 00:10:44.374\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; You go man, that was easy,\n\n192\n00:10:44.374 --> 00:10:45.060\nthat was great.\n\n193\n00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:49.070\nAnd now you go all right, let me configure\nthe desktop gateway, how do I find it?\n\n194\n00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.588\nAnd then you find it and\nyou're like [SOUND] I have to do all this?\n\n195\n00:10:52.588 --> 00:10:57.548\nNo, as long as you have access to\nthe other machine you simply switch over,\n\n196\n00:10:57.548 --> 00:11:00.645\nwhich is what I'm going\nto do to this machine.\n\n197\n00:11:03.258 --> 00:11:08.270\nAnd now that we're actually on RD01,\nI can click back on Servers-\n\n198\n00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:10.200\n&gt;&gt; Go to the server pool and try again.\n\n199\n00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.800\n&gt;&gt; And now-\n&gt;&gt; Dust yourself off.\n\n200\n00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.596\n&gt;&gt; That's right, yep.\n\n201\n00:11:12.596 --> 00:11:14.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If I right-click,\n\n202\n00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:18.270\nnotice now I have\nthe RD Gateway Manager and\n\n203\n00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.740\nthis time when I select it\n&gt;&gt; It gives me a whole another view\n\n204\n00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.750\ninstead.\n\n205\n00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:26.040\nAnd that is the view that we want\nwhich is this one right here,\n\n206\n00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.940\nthe RD Gateway Manager, and\nit tells us exactly what its purpose is.\n\n207\n00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:35.210\nThe RD Gateway enables authorized\nremote users to connect to resources on\n\n208\n00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:39.777\nan internal corporate or private network\nfrom any Internet-connected device.\n\n209\n00:11:39.777 --> 00:11:44.820\nSo currently,\nremember that we only really have\n\n210\n00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.740\none client right now,\nthat's just connected into the switch, so\n\n211\n00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:51.070\nit's not really going through the gateway,\nit's just not, okay?\n\n212\n00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.440\nSo, even though I set it up and it's\nthere, it's not really going through it,\n\n213\n00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.880\nit's not connecting,\nto make that work here.\n\n214\n00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.430\nBut, the good thing is, the server\ndoes show up as being gateway ready,\n\n215\n00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.120\nand that's what we want.\n\n216\n00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.030\nFrom here, I can go to the RD01 and\n\n217\n00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:09.870\nnow you have some other options\nunderneath Policies and Monitoring.\n\n218\n00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.100\nBut before we do that,\n\n219\n00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.550\nlet's take a look at some of\nthe details here in the middle, okay?\n\n220\n00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.170\nSo currently you can see\nthe connection status and\n\n221\n00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:22.210\nthat's the key for\nus in terms of at least basic monitoring.\n\n222\n00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:26.350\nLike if people are connecting in\nthrough my Remote Desktop Gateway, or\n\n223\n00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.320\nI'm not sure.\n\n224\n00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:32.010\nI can always come here and look, take\na look at the total number of connections.\n\n225\n00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:33.660\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Number of users connected to\n\n226\n00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:37.110\nthe server, number of resources that\nusers are connected to the server.\n\n227\n00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:39.850\nAll that's a big old fat goose\negg at this point, 0, okay?\n\n228\n00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.090\nNotice that it gives me disability to\ngo a little bit more detailed if I\n\n229\n00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:47.980\nhad an active connection connecting in,\nokay?\n\n230\n00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.631\nSo this one doesn't let me do that.\n\n231\n00:12:49.631 --> 00:12:53.170\nNow, let's see what happen if I\njust try and connect in here.\n\n232\n00:12:53.170 --> 00:13:00.100\nSo here it is, we're back at this page and\nlet's just use the ITProTV Demo.\n\n233\n00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.980\nLet's see if we can get\nsomething to register here.\n\n234\n00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.960\n&gt;&gt; So, you go on the thin PC and\n\n235\n00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.650\nyou're trying to connect it\ninto that particular server?\n\n236\n00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:10.500\n&gt;&gt; Right, so let's see if it hits\nthe RD gateway at this point, so\n\n237\n00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.890\nnow I'm connected and it says.\n\n238\n00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:14.600\nHey you are actually connected,\nso that's a good thing.\n\n239\n00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.030\nSo now if we take this and\nlet's see if I can refresh this thing.\n\n240\n00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.930\n&gt;&gt; It should see your connection.\n\n241\n00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:24.110\n&gt;&gt; If it sees it because\nit may not see it.\n\n242\n00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:28.520\nThe reason why is because\nI'm on the inside network.\n\n243\n00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.488\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha, so\nit didn't have to actually do anything.\n\n244\n00:13:29.488 --> 00:13:32.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\nwhat it's trying to do is monitor what,\n\n245\n00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.330\nthe connection going through the gateway.\n\n246\n00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:38.710\nSo if I had another machine that\nwas not directly connected but\n\n247\n00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.910\nthen went through a router and came in.\n\n248\n00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:42.960\nThis is the machine that should hit, okay?\n\n249\n00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.090\nBut right now I don't\nhave anything like that.\n\n250\n00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:47.970\nSo here you start seeing just\na couple of things, right?\n\n251\n00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:51.060\nThere is an authorization policy,\nI didn't set this one up.\n\n252\n00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.470\nThis is kind of the default\npolicy that we have.\n\n253\n00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:58.140\nResource Authorization Policy, this is\na default that we also have as well, okay?\n\n254\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.920\nNow, from here,\ncouple of other things we can do.\n\n255\n00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.560\nI always like to check out\nthe properties of the server first.\n\n256\n00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.100\nLet me zoom in just a little bit so\nwe can see that.\n\n257\n00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.730\nIf I right click,\nI'm going to select Properties first.\n\n258\n00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.800\nAnd now this is where you can configure\nsome of the properties you need to\n\n259\n00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.700\nactually think about when you start\nsetting up the Remote Desktop gateway.\n\n260\n00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.410\nSo at this particular point right?\n\n261\n00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:26.067\nIt says look Ronnie,\n\n262\n00:14:26.067 --> 00:14:31.695\nyou are saying allow the maximum\nsupported simultaneous connections.\n\n263\n00:14:31.695 --> 00:14:35.293\nAnd the maximum supported\nsimultaneous connections and\n\n264\n00:14:35.293 --> 00:14:37.130\nwe said how many is out right now?\n\n265\n00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.043\nTwo, two, okay, so.\n\n266\n00:14:40.043 --> 00:14:41.519\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, neat,\n\n267\n00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:44.580\n[LAUGH] that is pretty much it.\n\n268\n00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.610\nIsn't that amazing?\n\n269\n00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.670\nWe set up all that stuff,\nwe put all the certificates on,\n\n270\n00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:52.600\nwe did all that for\ntwo connections, isn't that great?\n\n271\n00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.800\nYeah, I know, it really isn't, okay?\n\n272\n00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.680\nBut you can see where you can\nhave a limitation to this.\n\n273\n00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.080\nOr you can even disable any new\nconnections if you want to.\n\n274\n00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:05.590\nSo it gives you this ability to be able\nto monitor and of course to manage.\n\n275\n00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.040\n&gt;&gt; Which can be nice because if\nwe're talking about licencing,\n\n276\n00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.350\nRonnie we might have to make sure\nwe're still in compliance with that.\n\n277\n00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:15.130\n&gt;&gt; That is true which we're going to\nget into in not to long from now.\n\n278\n00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:19.050\nAt least I think so, okay,\nnotice the SSL certificate.\n\n279\n00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.180\nNow we really put that role on actually,\nyeah.\n\n280\n00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.970\nI was trying to think if we did it or\nnot but we already did that.\n\n281\n00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:30.090\nAnd you can see it right here where\nwhen I selected that edit deployment\n\n282\n00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:35.470\ntask in the overview, it said look, here's\nthe actual certificate that's installed.\n\n283\n00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:38.970\nNow, if I wanted to change this and\nmake it its own certificate, notice I can\n\n284\n00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:44.430\nimport in another one or I can create\na self assigned certificate if I want to.\n\n285\n00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:46.130\nSo it even gives you options here.\n\n286\n00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.890\nSo if we're seeing there's already\ncertificate on it I wanna change this,\n\n287\n00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:51.370\nyou can actually change it if you want to.\n\n288\n00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:54.874\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie what would be the advantage\nof mixing up the certificates?\n\n289\n00:15:54.874 --> 00:15:58.186\nIs it just are we worried about one\nof those that one certificate being\n\n290\n00:15:58.186 --> 00:16:01.853\ncompromised and then having access to\nall different separate components.\n\n291\n00:16:01.853 --> 00:16:03.443\nI think more than anything, right,\n\n292\n00:16:03.443 --> 00:16:06.700\nit's about just management of how you\nchoose to separate out those roles.\n\n293\n00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.200\nIf you have different servers and\n\n294\n00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.730\nyou wanna make sure that they're distinct,\nyou do that.\n\n295\n00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:14.380\nBut for me, since all the roles are on one\nit's just easier for me to have one, but\n\n296\n00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.025\nyou can have different ones if\nyou choose to for each role.\n\n297\n00:16:17.025 --> 00:16:21.909\nAnd it's just the way that you like to\nkind of see things, so that's why a lot of\n\n298\n00:16:21.909 --> 00:16:27.460\nthem today, right, a lot of people today,\nare going with wild card certificates.\n\n299\n00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.616\nSo that way it doesn't matter\nwhat they choose to name it.\n\n300\n00:16:29.616 --> 00:16:33.181\nSo for instance here, right,\ninstead of me naming it RD01,\n\n301\n00:16:33.181 --> 00:16:36.629\ncuz I have to follow whatever\nis on that certificate, okay.\n\n302\n00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:42.730\nWhen people connect in, and that's\nwhat I did over on PC 01 here, right.\n\n303\n00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.930\nSo instead of actually having\nto connect in using this,\n\n304\n00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:49.770\nI could go to that remote gateway here and\ngo, I want a different name.\n\n305\n00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:54.010\nLets make it RD Gateway or\nRDS, whatever it might be.\n\n306\n00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.870\nAnd now somebody from the outside\nof the network can say,\n\n307\n00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:00.770\nI need to connect into\nrds.itprotvdemo.com,\n\n308\n00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.660\nand that should get them there too,\nwith the RD web of course at the end.\n\n309\n00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.176\nBut so you can change the name\nof how people can connect and\n\n310\n00:17:07.176 --> 00:17:08.180\naccess if you want to.\n\n311\n00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.870\n&gt;&gt; Even if you had a child domain\nthen you could even specify\n\n312\n00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:13.570\nonly letting that particular\nchild domain and so forth.\n\n313\n00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:15.384\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really does,\nit allows you to do that.\n\n314\n00:17:15.384 --> 00:17:20.193\nNow, the other things of course,\ntransport settings, notice right now,\n\n315\n00:17:20.193 --> 00:17:21.634\nit's kinda strange.\n\n316\n00:17:21.634 --> 00:17:25.416\nThere it is, it's only 443, so\nat this point, it's saying, hey,\n\n317\n00:17:25.416 --> 00:17:27.590\nwhat are you actually allowing in.\n\n318\n00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:32.620\nYou can change that if you want another\ndefault port, so even UDP says 33,\n\n319\n00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.150\n91 by default.\n\n320\n00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:40.530\nThis is the, what they call\na connection authorization policy.\n\n321\n00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:44.612\nNotice that NPS is running\non the local machine.\n\n322\n00:17:44.612 --> 00:17:48.760\nSo if you wanted to set this up where you\nhad a particular centralized NPS server\n\n323\n00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.760\nfor your policy servers here.\n\n324\n00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:56.450\nYou can, of course, change that as well,\nif this is part of a server farm.\n\n325\n00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:01.460\nNow, this is the first time we've used\nthe term as far as our shows go, okay.\n\n326\n00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:04.760\nBut if you had multiple servers\nthat were connecting in and\n\n327\n00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.930\nyou had multiple RD gateways and\nyou wanted them to be registered here.\n\n328\n00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.780\nYou could actually make them\na part of that membership too.\n\n329\n00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:16.080\nAuditing, of course,\nall of this actually being audited, so\n\n330\n00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.090\nit's sending it to a log so\nthat way we can check it out.\n\n331\n00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:23.720\nSSL Bridging is a little bit more unusual,\ninstead of tunneling everything together,\n\n332\n00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.010\nit can instead use bridging.\n\n333\n00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.700\nNow you might be going like,\nwell, what the heck does,\n\n334\n00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.910\nwhy would I choose this over tunneling?\n\n335\n00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:31.520\nWhy would I do that?\n\n336\n00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.020\nIf you're running through a proxy server,\nthat's why you would need this option.\n\n337\n00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.850\nSo if you're using a proxy server,\nyou can use a bridging.\n\n338\n00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.200\nIt then connects you to the proxy,\nand that then becomes a bridge for\n\n339\n00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.240\nus to make the SSL connection.\n\n340\n00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.100\nSo from the outside, they go to\nthe proxy server, and then now that\n\n341\n00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.810\nyou're on the inside, you still need that\nconnection through the proxy server.\n\n342\n00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.580\nThat's what SSL bridging is about.\n\n343\n00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.860\n&gt;&gt; That's just because certain protocols,\nlike telling protocols,\n\n344\n00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:57.870\nand six to four, four to six,\ncertain types of trader and reader.\n\n345\n00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.685\nThey don't do well with that translation.\n\n346\n00:18:59.685 --> 00:19:00.960\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah, and\n\n347\n00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.500\njust the very fact is proxy servers\nplay havoc on certain things.\n\n348\n00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.580\nSo we don't really ever directly\nconnect that server, right.\n\n349\n00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.910\nSo if you're coming in from\nthe outside on a proxy,\n\n350\n00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.910\nyou're not directly connecting to RD01,\nyou're connecting to the proxy.\n\n351\n00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:15.220\n&gt;&gt; Cut out the middle man, yeah.\n\n352\n00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.300\n&gt;&gt; And so here it's saying, okay,\n\n353\n00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.950\nI can figure out the middle man if you'll\ntell me if this is what you wanna do.\n\n354\n00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.470\nOkay, so that's what it will do, and,\n\n355\n00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:26.140\nof course, messaging systems just\nin case everything goes down.\n\n356\n00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:30.340\nSo you have all those options\navailable and even more.\n\n357\n00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:34.170\nNow, we're not gonna get into\nthe configuration of all these, but you,\n\n358\n00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:38.000\nof course, can customize different\npolicies that you can see.\n\n359\n00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:43.910\nResource authorization, and\nof course monitoring if you choose to.\n\n360\n00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:47.020\nSo just take a look and\nunderstand that there's a lot of options\n\n361\n00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:51.130\nthat are available when you start\nsetting up that RD gateway, okay.\n\n362\n00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:55.980\nNow once that's set up, ideally, and\nI don't have the ability to do so\n\n363\n00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.340\nright now, cuz of the limitations\nof my physical machine.\n\n364\n00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.577\nBut you would do the same thing\nthat we've doing all along,\n\n365\n00:20:01.577 --> 00:20:03.119\nwhich is testing every component of it.\n\n366\n00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:05.787\nSo you'd put a machine on\nthe outside of your network,\n\n367\n00:20:05.787 --> 00:20:09.209\nif you have two different wireless\nnetworks such as a guest network and\n\n368\n00:20:09.209 --> 00:20:11.357\na regular production network that you use.\n\n369\n00:20:11.357 --> 00:20:15.474\nWe'll just put a machine\non the guest network, and\n\n370\n00:20:15.474 --> 00:20:18.840\nonce you do that see\nif you can connect in.\n\n371\n00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.170\nSee if it connects through\nthe Remote Desktop Gateway machine, and\n\n372\n00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:25.680\nif it does, then you know you've\nsuccessfully figured it out here.\n\n373\n00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:30.110\nBut overall, though, just kinda realize\nthat it may take a little bit more for you\n\n374\n00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:33.770\nto get it set up, depending on the needs\nthat you have inside of your network.\n\n375\n00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:38.750\nBut this is a big step to making sure that\nsomething like this actually happens, and\n\n376\n00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.440\ndoes what it needs to is right here, okay.\n\n377\n00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:47.040\nSo by setting up this gateway,\nthen everything should be ready now, and\n\n378\n00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.410\nthe only other thing that we would have\nto configure at this point, of course, if\n\n379\n00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:55.220\nyou're going to do this, especially if you\nchanged a certificate name and everything.\n\n380\n00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:59.010\nYou gotta go back into your DNS and\ndo what?\n\n381\n00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.850\nChange some records there,\nright, so set that up and go,\n\n382\n00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:06.440\nhey, here's where it's gonna connect to,\nand this is what's gonna happen as well.\n\n383\n00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.862\nSo just make sure that you\nfollow all that up and do that.\n\n384\n00:21:09.862 --> 00:21:11.340\nOnce again this is not a DNS show, so\n\n385\n00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.790\nwe're not gonna change all those records,\nbut just kinda realize,\n\n386\n00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:17.310\nit does affect other systems if you're\ngonna make something like this happen.\n\n387\n00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.570\nBut at least on the gateway portion,\n\n388\n00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:23.430\nokay, this is something that we'll\ndefinitely take care of here, okay.\n\n389\n00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:26.470\nNow we do need to talk about licensing,\nbut Cherokee,\n\n390\n00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:30.690\nI think I'm running very low on time and\nit wouldn't give it fair value to try and\n\n391\n00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:33.882\ncram everything in licensing in in\nthe next couple of minutes here.\n\n392\n00:21:33.882 --> 00:21:37.110\n&gt;&gt; We could have a whole show on just\nlicensing, it gets a little complicated.\n\n393\n00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:38.670\nBut I don't think we're\ngonna go that deep, but\n\n394\n00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.840\nI think we will cover what you\nneed to know to set this up.\n\n395\n00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.270\nSounds great Ronnie, thank you for\ntaking the time to go ahead and\n\n396\n00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:48.330\nshow us the particulars,\nat least with configuring that Gateway.\n\n397\n00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.280\nBut thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for tuning in.\n\n398\n00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.540\nStay tuned, like Ronnie said, we have more\nto cover, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n399\n00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.210\nsign off for this particular show.\n\n400\n00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.010\nRemember I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n401\n00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:59.020\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n402\n00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.826\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPro TV.\n\n403\n00:22:03.621 --> 00:22:09.006\n[MUSIC]\n\n404\n00:22:09.006 --> 00:22:11.648\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:10.821\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.821 --> 00:00:13.253\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:13.253 --> 00:00:17.510\nWelcome to your Remote Desktop Services\nshow, I'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.830\nIn the previous episode we were looking\nat how to configure our RD Gateway.\n\n7\n00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.830\nIn this show, we'll be focusing more\non setting up a licensing server and\n\n8\n00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.080\nconfiguring that.\n\n9\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.670\nWith us today we have Mr.\nRonnie Wong in studios.\n\n10\n00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.000\nThank you for joining us today Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.690\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\nhaving me back as we continue on to set up\n\n12\n00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.320\nthe remaining portions of what we\nneed to get, everything going.\n\n13\n00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.100\nAnd licensing is one of the more\nimportant components that we have\n\n14\n00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.510\nto make sure that we understand and\nthat we set up.\n\n15\n00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.440\nAnd it's also one of the more confusing\ncomponents that we have to setup and\n\n16\n00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.890\nget going, as well.\n\n17\n00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.500\nAnd the confusion is not how to set it up,\nit's the particular way of setting up is\n\n18\n00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.120\nrelatively easy but the choices that\nyou have can be a little bit confusing.\n\n19\n00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.280\nCherokee and I are gonna talk about\nthat a little bit as well and\n\n20\n00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.830\nthen we'll also of course set it up and\n\n21\n00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.120\nwe'll put in some licensing information\nfor us to show how that's done too.\n\n22\n00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.800\nNow, there will come a point in time\nwhich we won't show you the licensing but\n\n23\n00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.760\noverall, though,\nat least get it started and\n\n24\n00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.790\nshow you that but we'll finish up the\nremaining configuration with this, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.970\nSo, let's make sure that we\nunderstand everything so far.\n\n26\n00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.930\nEverything is now configured and\nready to go if you've been following\n\n27\n00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.680\nthe entire series from\nthe beginning to the end.\n\n28\n00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.320\nWe now have where we can, in the theory,\nconnect in through the remote\n\n29\n00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.130\ngateway should be a secured connection,\nbut our only limitation\n\n30\n00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.120\nthat now that we have left is really\ngoing to be that aspect of licensing.\n\n31\n00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.562\nWithout licensing,\nthere's a couple of things that happen.\n\n32\n00:01:49.562 --> 00:01:50.902\nEven if you turn it on,\n\n33\n00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:55.291\nthe great thing is you get a grace\nperiod at this particular point in time.\n\n34\n00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:58.312\nSo I think for\nit's like 180 days or so, or\n\n35\n00:01:58.312 --> 00:02:02.260\nmaybe 90 days when we take a look at it,\nwe'll see.\n\n36\n00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.980\nIt gives you a little bit of a grace\nperiod on how people can connect in and\n\n37\n00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.480\nyou can work with that.\n\n38\n00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.990\nUntil the point where that time\nperiod runs out, then you have to\n\n39\n00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.050\nprovide licensing and that's where\nit can get a little bit costly or\n\n40\n00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.300\nit can get a little bit confusing\nespecially if you let it run out and\n\n41\n00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.640\nthen you have to see if everything\nconnects in after that point.\n\n42\n00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.490\nSo that's what we wanna make sure\nthat we understand that we are going\n\n43\n00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.100\nto set up and do.\n\n44\n00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.740\nSo when we kind of left off, we finished\nup the configuration of the gateway.\n\n45\n00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.070\nAnd now we need to move to\nthe licensing side of things and\n\n46\n00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.520\nthat is what we are going to do.\n\n47\n00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.200\nSo let's go and take a look here.\n\n48\n00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.560\nI'm going to simply close out on my\nmachine here the RD Gateway Manager.\n\n49\n00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.160\nAnd it's been a little bit of time so\nlet me now go ahead and log back in.\n\n50\n00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.306\nClose out of that, and over on DC01,\n\n51\n00:02:55.306 --> 00:02:59.150\nif I right click you can also now see\n\n52\n00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.310\nwhere there is the Remote Desktop\nLicensing Manager as well.\n\n53\n00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.168\nSo this is where we can figure\nthe last two remaining roles here.\n\n54\n00:03:08.168 --> 00:03:10.750\nAnd it's giving me a little\nwarning again saying hey you can't\n\n55\n00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.650\nopen this tool on this one.\n\n56\n00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.675\nGo to the machine and let's ensure that it\nhas the licensing server running which is\n\n57\n00:03:16.675 --> 00:03:18.300\non my DCO1 as you see right here.\n\n58\n00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.590\nSo now I bring back up the Server Manager\nthis time I select on DC01.\n\n59\n00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.000\nAnd there's a couple of\nthings that you're gonna see,\n\n60\n00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.820\nthis is gonna probably start drawing\nsome attention a little bit.\n\n61\n00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.120\nAnd I wanna zoom in on this,\nto try and show you what I'm doing.\n\n62\n00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.800\nOn a regular network, more than likely,\nyou're gonna be connected in,\n\n63\n00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.040\nand you're gonna have Internet access.\n\n64\n00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.800\nIn my lab environment, I didn't\nchoose to provide Internet access for\n\n65\n00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.460\nbecause there was no reason for\nme to do so.\n\n66\n00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.200\nBut if you need to establish\nyour licensing server,\n\n67\n00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.200\nit means that you have to\nhave an Internet connection\n\n68\n00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.830\nbecause it reaches out to-\n&gt;&gt; Validate.\n\n69\n00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.710\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft to validate everything and\nthat's kind of the key.\n\n70\n00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.580\nSo if you're not sure and you've set it\nand you continue to try and activate your\n\n71\n00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.840\nlicensing server and it's not working,\ncheck your Internet connection.\n\n72\n00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.650\nHere I just simply added in\na second network adapter.\n\n73\n00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.930\nAnd that's why you're seeing a couple\nof IP addresses there instead.\n\n74\n00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.424\nIf I right click on DCO1,\nI can now select the remote desktop or\n\n75\n00:04:20.424 --> 00:04:23.440\nthe RD Licensing Manager.\n\n76\n00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.170\nAnd now we will get the kind of effect\nthat we want, which is right here.\n\n77\n00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.740\nLet me full screen that so\nthat we can zoom in a little bit more.\n\n78\n00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.710\nYou'll notice right away, there's a big\nred x there which always draws the eye.\n\n79\n00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.630\nWe have the navigation pane\nover on the left-hand side.\n\n80\n00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:48.980\nMy select on DC01, you might think that\neverything is nice and ready to go.\n\n81\n00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.110\nBecause what you start seeing here is,\nlook at that, Cherokee.\n\n82\n00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.685\nIt says I have Total Licenses, Unlimited.\n\n83\n00:04:55.685 --> 00:04:59.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Available, Unlimited.\n\n84\n00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.550\nSounds great, I've issued none of them\nat this particular point in time.\n\n85\n00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.250\nSo I think I'm pretty much ready to go and\ndon't have to worry about anything.\n\n86\n00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.850\nExcept for the very fact that it says\nsomething a little bit more unusual which\n\n87\n00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:18.835\nis Windows 2000\nServer Built-in TS Per Device CAL, okay?\n\n88\n00:05:18.835 --> 00:05:22.280\nSo TS is the order term for RDS.\n\n89\n00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.120\n&gt;&gt; Terminal services.\n\n90\n00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.950\n&gt;&gt; Or terminal services, RDS or\nremote desktop services.\n\n91\n00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.440\nAnd that's what we see here, okay?\n\n92\n00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.950\nNow, notice there's a little\nplus sign beside our DC01,\n\n93\n00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.650\nwith a little red x,\nwhich we still haven't investigated yet.\n\n94\n00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.140\nSo, if I click on that, and\nnow you can see, there it is,\n\n95\n00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.500\nit kind of gives us a nice little\nhierarchy of elements that we can see.\n\n96\n00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.560\nBut it doesn't look like it\ncan do anything, Cherokee,\n\n97\n00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.450\nso I'm kind of toast at this\npoint if I don't know what to do.\n\n98\n00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.520\nThat's why we have the show,\n\n99\n00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.610\nis that we wanna make sure that we\nunderstand what it is that we're doing.\n\n100\n00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.981\nThere are a couple of times during the\nentire series where I kinda said, let's\n\n101\n00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:04.622\njust click on this or let's get this right\nnow because this is where we're heading.\n\n102\n00:06:04.622 --> 00:06:05.992\n&gt;&gt; We'll come back and talk about it.\n\n103\n00:06:05.992 --> 00:06:07.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and come back and talk about it.\n\n104\n00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.174\nAnd so this is why.\n\n105\n00:06:09.174 --> 00:06:13.141\nRemember we just turned it off but\nwe haven't configured in licensing.\n\n106\n00:06:13.141 --> 00:06:16.839\nSo right now we if we were to connect\nthrough remote desktop gateway,\n\n107\n00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:18.706\nwe'd be given that grace period.\n\n108\n00:06:18.706 --> 00:06:23.503\nAnd this is why in the corner of my screen\non the lower right hand side you probably\n\n109\n00:06:23.503 --> 00:06:27.550\nsaw a balloon pop up that said\nhey you're not licensed here.\n\n110\n00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.670\nCan you still use this?\n\n111\n00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.470\nYes, as long as you're in\nthe grace period, okay.\n\n112\n00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.190\nBut once you're out of\nthat grace period no more.\n\n113\n00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.990\nSo now we need to set this thing up.\n\n114\n00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.310\nSo on DC01 I am going to\nright click on it and\n\n115\n00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.490\nthen select of course\nProperties here to help us out.\n\n116\n00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.350\nNow this particular property\ndoesn't really help us except it\n\n117\n00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.630\ngives us some information which\nwe need to know about, okay?\n\n118\n00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.308\nSo at this particular point, let's just\ntake a look at it's overall properties.\n\n119\n00:06:57.308 --> 00:06:59.960\nCurrently it says the connection\nmethod because it needs to\n\n120\n00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.170\nreach out to Microsoft to do anything.\n\n121\n00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.240\nNow, it's says automatic connection.\n\n122\n00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.650\nI have the option to either use a web\nbrowser or to use the telephone call.\n\n123\n00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.960\nNow, the telephone call\nis a little it annoying.\n\n124\n00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.490\nIt's kind of robotic,\nyou haven't heard it and\n\n125\n00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.050\nthen you're gonna have to enter\nin license number anyways.\n\n126\n00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.808\nSo it gives you the ability and so\nautomatic connection is probably\n\n127\n00:07:19.808 --> 00:07:22.700\nthe easiest way especially if\nyou have a good connection.\n\n128\n00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.090\nBut notice right down here it says\nlicensing server ID, it is not activated.\n\n129\n00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.310\nAnd that's kind of the first key here.\n\n130\n00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.488\nWe need to activate that server.\n\n131\n00:07:31.488 --> 00:07:33.380\nAs far as required information goes,\n\n132\n00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.990\nthis information we definitely need to\nfill out if we're going to be connecting\n\n133\n00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.110\ninto Microsoft to get the information\nthat we need and to activate this server.\n\n134\n00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.780\nAnd that is because each one\nof these is personalized.\n\n135\n00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:48.496\nNow, I can fill it our right there but the\ngreat thing is they have a kind of walk\n\n136\n00:07:48.496 --> 00:07:52.504\nthrough wizard for us and\nthat is where we are going to set this up.\n\n137\n00:07:52.504 --> 00:07:55.075\nSo if I right click on DC01 instead\nof going down to Properties,\n\n138\n00:07:55.075 --> 00:07:57.350\ncuz that's kind of my\nfavorite thing to do.\n\n139\n00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.873\nWhat we want instead is the second option.\n\n140\n00:07:59.873 --> 00:08:04.033\nThat says review the configuration, or\nnotice that we have Activate Server,\n\n141\n00:08:04.033 --> 00:08:06.930\nthat's probably the right\none that we want.\n\n142\n00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:10.120\nAnd then we have even Advanced\nstuff that we can do here, okay?\n\n143\n00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.549\nSo let's go ahead and setup the,\nlet's see here, Activate Server,\n\n144\n00:08:14.549 --> 00:08:16.510\nlet's try that for right now.\n\n145\n00:08:18.562 --> 00:08:21.440\nAnd we can see that too, all right.\n\n146\n00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.800\nNow let's review the configuration.\n\n147\n00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.220\nI'm kind of not remembering.\n\n148\n00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.100\n&gt;&gt; Indecisive.\n\n149\n00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI was trying to think which one should\n\n150\n00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.280\nI do first, but let's do this one first.\n\n151\n00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.570\nBecause this is where we get explanations\ninstead of just walking through it, okay?\n\n152\n00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.190\nSo on the reviewing the configuration,\ncurrently right now,\n\n153\n00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.290\nyou can notice where it says\nthe License Server Name.\n\n154\n00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:47.420\nAnd, of course, its scope at this\npoint which is the entire domain and\n\n155\n00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.580\nit even tells you where the location\nof that is going to be.\n\n156\n00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.050\nYou can change the scope to\ngo beyond if you want to.\n\n157\n00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:58.080\nBut what we're concerned about is this\nyellow check mark right here, okay?\n\n158\n00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.840\nThis license server or\nnetwork service account is not a member\n\n159\n00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.740\nof the terminal server license\ngroup in Active directory.\n\n160\n00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:10.750\nAnd you might say well,\nin that caught RDS now?\n\n161\n00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.550\nYes, but\nwhy do they still have the old name?\n\n162\n00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.470\nWhat for backward compatibility?\n\n163\n00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:20.340\nYou're gonna find networks out there\nthat still may run a few server,\n\n164\n00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.660\n2008 servers out there.\n\n165\n00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:27.930\nAnd if we're gonna be using group\npolicy with previous terminal services.\n\n166\n00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.400\nWell, they still keep that name in\nthere for stuff like that, too.\n\n167\n00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.890\nSo now notice it says this license\nserver will not be able to issue\n\n168\n00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:39.860\nRDS Per User CALs to users in the domain.\n\n169\n00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:45.530\nYou will not be able to track or report\nusage of RDS Per User CALs on this server.\n\n170\n00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.070\nWell that's what we want.\n\n171\n00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:51.489\nWe want to be able to track that because\nit's all about licensing as we connect in,\n\n172\n00:09:51.489 --> 00:09:52.203\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n173\n00:09:52.203 --> 00:09:57.120\nYep, so, this server is pretty much\ntelling us yeah, I can't do any of that.\n\n174\n00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.700\nSo, Ronnie you turned it on but\nit can't do anything.\n\n175\n00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.420\nWell, that's why we have to set this up.\n\n176\n00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.080\nSo, the first thing we do\nis we add it to the group.\n\n177\n00:10:06.545 --> 00:10:09.150\nNotice that one site\nselect add to the group.\n\n178\n00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.971\nTo add the computer account for this\nlicensing server to the network account\n\n179\n00:10:12.971 --> 00:10:15.547\nfor this,\nyou must have domain admin privileges.\n\n180\n00:10:15.547 --> 00:10:20.280\nI'm logged in as domain admin and\nthen I click OK.\n\n181\n00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.851\nAnd now I told you that everything\nis now good, click OK as well.\n\n182\n00:10:26.737 --> 00:10:31.990\nThe other thing is not\nreading closely enough.\n\n183\n00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:35.488\nIs, if you simply close this out and\nyou forget about this now,\n\n184\n00:10:35.488 --> 00:10:39.220\nwhere it says you must restart\nthe desktop licensing here.\n\n185\n00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.950\nUntil it's restarted the licensing,\nstill we'll not be able to do so.\n\n186\n00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.660\nSo this license server is,\nessentially, still useless,\n\n187\n00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.700\neven though we've now added\nit to the correct group.\n\n188\n00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.660\nSo now, I need to go in and\nrestart that service.\n\n189\n00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:56.830\nNow, unlike everything else that we have,\na lot of these are newer types of menus\n\n190\n00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:00.600\nreally do allow you to go in and\nrestart the service here.\n\n191\n00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.270\nBut on this one, it doesn't.\n\n192\n00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.450\nAnd I don't know what happened\nin this particular setup here.\n\n193\n00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:06.510\nWhere you don't have that.\n\n194\n00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:10.440\nSo I've tried to right click and\nthought I will find something\n\n195\n00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.900\nunderneath Advanced here that says\nrestart service or something.\n\n196\n00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.260\nBut it's not actually listed in here.\n\n197\n00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.404\nSo this is where you have to kinda\nbring up your trusty server skills.\n\n198\n00:11:22.357 --> 00:11:23.636\nAnd typing skills\n\n199\n00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:33.700\nServices.msc.\n\n200\n00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.944\nAnd bring up the old services console.\n\n201\n00:11:35.944 --> 00:11:42.010\nAnd if I scroll down to\nthe Remote Desktop Services here.\n\n202\n00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.010\nLet me zoom in to that particular area.\n\n203\n00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.400\nNotice that we have\nthe Remote Desktop Licensing,\n\n204\n00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.980\nand that is the service that\nsays it needs to be restarted.\n\n205\n00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.940\nSo we're simply gonna\nrestart this service.\n\n206\n00:11:58.760 --> 00:11:59.700\nAnd at that point,\n\n207\n00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:05.660\nwell hopefully everything is now going to\nbe ready to go from this point here, okay?\n\n208\n00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.180\nSo let's set up and\nactivate the server then.\n\n209\n00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.190\nSo now that's actually restarted,\nwe're perfectly fine.\n\n210\n00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:16.660\nIf it doesn't reboot the server, that's\nwhat I would normally suggest that you do.\n\n211\n00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.770\nThat usually fixes everything anyways.\n\n212\n00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:20.870\nSo now we're going to walk\nthrough the wizard here.\n\n213\n00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.861\nClick Next, we're gonna select what it\nshowed us on the properties anyways,\n\n214\n00:12:24.861 --> 00:12:26.743\nwhich is the automatic connection.\n\n215\n00:12:28.409 --> 00:12:32.630\nAnd notice it's now locating\nthe Microsoft clearing house server.\n\n216\n00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:33.850\nSo it's connecting in.\n\n217\n00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:37.140\nIt's saying hey,\nI'm about to establish a licensing server.\n\n218\n00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.264\nSo now we want the name of\nwho's going to be doing this.\n\n219\n00:12:45.267 --> 00:12:46.323\nOops.\n\n220\n00:12:46.323 --> 00:12:49.435\nAm I in the minor outlying island?\n\n221\n00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:50.251\nI don't think I am.\n\n222\n00:12:52.107 --> 00:12:53.355\n&gt;&gt; I'd like to be.\n\n223\n00:12:53.355 --> 00:12:55.908\n&gt;&gt; Yes, of course you-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n224\n00:12:55.908 --> 00:12:56.520\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n225\n00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.276\nwell you're close,\nyou're at the ITProTV studio so\n\n226\n00:12:59.276 --> 00:13:03.640\nthat's as close as you're gonna get\nto Paradise right now, all right.\n\n227\n00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.409\nSo from here you might\ndo something like admin.\n\n228\n00:13:07.409 --> 00:13:09.540\nLet me not do that, letme use my real.\n\n229\n00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.540\n&gt;&gt; Now, this is all important, because\nwe're not just allowing individuals to\n\n230\n00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:17.950\nconnect to our terminal server or\nour remote desktop configuration here.\n\n231\n00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.190\nWe're not sharing out just\none operating system.\n\n232\n00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.010\nWell, number one, that's illegal.\n\n233\n00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Microsoft owns that software, right?\n\n234\n00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.350\nAnd if you do get audited by them,\nthey basically ask for\n\n235\n00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:32.253\nan Excel spreadsheet and you give all\nthe information about who's connecting.\n\n236\n00:13:32.253 --> 00:13:36.915\nUsually, they really don't go into\nlegal action unless you're directly\n\n237\n00:13:36.915 --> 00:13:41.207\ndefying them, and hopefully you have\na legal team to handle that, so\n\n238\n00:13:41.207 --> 00:13:43.812\nyou don't have to do with it yourselves.\n\n239\n00:13:43.812 --> 00:13:46.659\nBut this is important,\nwhat Ronnie is showing here,\n\n240\n00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:49.140\nthat's the point I'm\ntrying to make here so.\n\n241\n00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.009\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's-\n&gt;&gt; It may seem like a lot of extra\n\n242\n00:13:51.009 --> 00:13:53.790\nwork but it's something that\nreally needs to be done.\n\n243\n00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.580\n&gt;&gt; If you're gonna be using this\nin production, definitely, right.\n\n244\n00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.250\nSo I don't really have to set this up.\n\n245\n00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:00.130\nBut overall though,\n\n246\n00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:03.750\nsince we're actually doing this,\nI'm providing the detailed information so\n\n247\n00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:08.060\nthat if they do need to come and do\nan audit that they can if they choose to.\n\n248\n00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.240\nClick Next here.\n\n249\n00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.030\nNotice now it's actually activated.\n\n250\n00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.970\nAnd there's actually a check\nbox here too that says, hey,\n\n251\n00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:19.630\nare you ready to start installing\nlicenses if you choose to?\n\n252\n00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.660\nWell it just depends on whether or\nnot you're ready.\n\n253\n00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.860\nIf you are then you simply select\nStart the licensing wizard.\n\n254\n00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.245\nBut let me just go ahead and\nclick Finish at this point.\n\n255\n00:14:30.245 --> 00:14:35.460\nNotice that the green check mark\nhas now replaced the red x.\n\n256\n00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.810\nIf I right click and\ngo back down to review the configuration,\n\n257\n00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:43.460\nyou wanna verify that these two are here\ninstead of that yellow kind of warning,\n\n258\n00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.180\ntriangle that we had before.\n\n259\n00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.450\nAnd you want to read,\n\n260\n00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:52.145\nI know this is strange, reading is a still\na big part of our society today, so.\n\n261\n00:14:52.145 --> 00:14:54.038\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Notice here it says,\n\n262\n00:14:54.038 --> 00:14:57.627\nnow look this license server\nwill be able to issue and\n\n263\n00:14:57.627 --> 00:15:02.126\nthat's the key term here\nRDS Per User CALs to users in the domain.\n\n264\n00:15:02.126 --> 00:15:06.910\nYou will be able to track and report\nusage of RDS Per User CALs on the server.\n\n265\n00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.890\nTo issue Per User CALs to users in other\ndomain, this license server must be\n\n266\n00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:15.190\na member of the Terminal Server Licensing\ngroups in those domains as well.\n\n267\n00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:21.710\nSo it really does give you the sense\nat least and it recognizes the fact\n\n268\n00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:26.610\nthat now this is a fully functioning\nlicensing server with one problem.\n\n269\n00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.710\nNo licenses is the key.\n\n270\n00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:32.360\nNow if we go back down to Properties here.\n\n271\n00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.540\nNow, you can take a look and\n\n272\n00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:40.440\ndown here in Licensing Server ID,\nit shows us something else too, okay?\n\n273\n00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.320\nSo here's the actual ID key, I don't know\nif I should be showing that to you or\n\n274\n00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.670\nnot, but I just did very quickly.\n\n275\n00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.045\nSo there you go, okay?\n\n276\n00:15:47.045 --> 00:15:50.970\n[LAUGH] So we kind of pulled\nthat up just briefly but I just.\n\n277\n00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:54.664\nSo, cuz it actually looks like\na product key, that's why I'm not sure.\n\n278\n00:15:54.664 --> 00:16:02.193\nBut overall, though, just realize that\nif you do have that You should see that.\n\n279\n00:16:02.193 --> 00:16:06.065\nBut if it says it's not activated,\nsomething went wrong during the activation\n\n280\n00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:08.770\npoint, just need to go\nthrough that process.\n\n281\n00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:12.850\nSo first and foremost, make sure you\nadd it to the group it needs to be.\n\n282\n00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:15.890\nOnce you add it to that group,\nrestart the service.\n\n283\n00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:19.570\nAnd then, go through the activation point,\nthe link there.\n\n284\n00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:25.680\nMake sure it actually activates and\ngives you that particular license ID key.\n\n285\n00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.110\nAnd now, you're ready to add in license\nand that's our next step here, okay?\n\n286\n00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:31.210\nNow everything up in this point,\n\n287\n00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:35.930\nlike we said, it doesn't seem\nlike it's a brain surgery, right?\n\n288\n00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:36.970\nI'm not saying it's not difficult.\n\n289\n00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:37.724\nYou still gotta find everything.\n\n290\n00:16:37.724 --> 00:16:39.600\nYou still gotta remember everything.\n\n291\n00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.619\nBut overall though its not the most\ndifficult thing you've seen that we've\n\n292\n00:16:43.619 --> 00:16:45.150\ndone so far, okay.\n\n293\n00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.896\nSo now we need to install license,\n\n294\n00:16:46.896 --> 00:16:51.067\nthe great thing is we right click on most\nthings, we can find exactly what we need.\n\n295\n00:16:51.067 --> 00:16:56.850\nIn the third bullet point down here,\nyou'll see it says install licenses, okay.\n\n296\n00:16:56.850 --> 00:17:00.390\nSo it's right here,\nwe run through another wizard.\n\n297\n00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:04.130\nNotice it already figures out\nwhat the licensing severs are.\n\n298\n00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:08.120\nAnd I have to remain connected to\nthe network during this entire time.\n\n299\n00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.878\nNow, in a real production\nnetwork that's gonna work, okay?\n\n300\n00:17:09.878 --> 00:17:13.463\nBut if you're just doing this for a test\nbed environment, you may not leave it\n\n301\n00:17:13.463 --> 00:17:17.300\nconnected during the whole time but\nduring this process you have to.\n\n302\n00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.950\nSo make sure that it's connected there.\n\n303\n00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:20.805\nClick Next here.\n\n304\n00:17:20.805 --> 00:17:23.340\nAnd now it went ahead and connect.\n\n305\n00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:26.720\nAnd you have different options\ndepending on your license\n\n306\n00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.810\nagreement that you have with Microsoft.\n\n307\n00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.940\nYou'll choose of course the correct one.\n\n308\n00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:35.210\nWhether it's retail, open licensing,\nselect, enterprise agreement, campus,\n\n309\n00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:39.180\nschools, service provider\nlicense agreement, you name it.\n\n310\n00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.860\nThere are plenty of different ones.\n\n311\n00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.130\nAnd it's gonna tell you, hey.\n\n312\n00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.810\nThere's gonna be a product key that\nyou'll enter in according to this.\n\n313\n00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:50.690\nI'm gonna leave mine at\nthe license pack retail purchase.\n\n314\n00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:51.610\nAnd that tells you something.\n\n315\n00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:55.930\nRetail purchase, Cherokee,\nwhat does retail purchase mean?\n\n316\n00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:56.710\nSpend money right.\n\n317\n00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:58.850\nThat's what it means,\nokay when it comes down to it.\n\n318\n00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.060\nI was hoping that Cherokee\nwould yell spend money.\n\n319\n00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.650\nBut she didn't, she didn't jump in at all.\n\n320\n00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:03.458\nSo there you go.\n\n321\n00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:07.060\nIt means that we're gonna spend money,\nokay, that's what it comes down to.\n\n322\n00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:11.590\nSo you do need to make sure that you\nknow how many users are connecting in\n\n323\n00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.720\nbecause you need to purchase\nthe right amount of licences, right?\n\n324\n00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n325\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.000\nThat's kind of the key because\nif you purchase too few,\n\n326\n00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.670\nwell now you're gonna have issues.\n\n327\n00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:21.481\nToo many and you're kind of\n&gt;&gt; Wasting money.\n\n328\n00:18:21.481 --> 00:18:22.133\n&gt;&gt; Wasting money.\n\n329\n00:18:22.133 --> 00:18:26.440\nSo you need to be able to do what\nyou are thinking about here.\n\n330\n00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.520\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, when you said earlier\nabout COWs and we're not talking about\n\n331\n00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.640\nmoo cows like out in the farm-\n&gt;&gt; Are you sure?\n\n332\n00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.493\nIts possible.\n\n333\n00:18:32.493 --> 00:18:34.237\n[LAUGH] I don't know are we?\n\n334\n00:18:34.237 --> 00:18:34.830\n&gt;&gt; No, No.\n\n335\n00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.980\nCOWs stands for client access license.\n\n336\n00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:43.000\nAnd that of course is where we're going to\nsee right here in the next step I believe.\n\n337\n00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.530\nDepending on the license\ncode that we have,\n\n338\n00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.460\nwe can actually select\na couple of options.\n\n339\n00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:52.850\nAnd the two options that we need\nto discuss at this point is one,\n\n340\n00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:57.080\nwe can either have people\nconnect in per device and\n\n341\n00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.655\nhave a number of licenses for each device.\n\n342\n00:18:59.655 --> 00:19:02.660\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Or one per device, I should say, or\n\n343\n00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.210\nwe can do it per user, okay.\n\n344\n00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:08.973\nSo in this sense, Cherokee and\nI were talking about this before the show.\n\n345\n00:19:08.973 --> 00:19:10.381\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; At some point, and so\n\n346\n00:19:10.381 --> 00:19:12.720\nwe wanna kinda make a presentation,\n\n347\n00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.690\njust a brief presentation\nhere of what we mean by this.\n\n348\n00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:22.330\nSo Cherokee, if we talk about the idea\nof a per device type of count,\n\n349\n00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:26.100\na client access license,\nwhat are we really trying to do?\n\n350\n00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.780\n&gt;&gt; You're really defining access based\nupon one individual machine, one computer\n\n351\n00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:36.140\nversus an individual profile like\nRonnie Wong's Active Directory account.\n\n352\n00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:36.640\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n353\n00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.345\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah.\n\n354\n00:19:37.345 --> 00:19:39.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So when you said that wow,\n\n355\n00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.045\nvery concise, thank you.\n\n356\n00:19:41.045 --> 00:19:43.890\n[LAUGH] So\nwhen we start thinking about this.\n\n357\n00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.390\nLet's take for\nan example that we have 50 computers.\n\n358\n00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:49.310\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well we have 50 computers and\n\n359\n00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.710\neach of them are going to connect in.\n\n360\n00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.950\nWell, that gives us the ability to have,\nwell, just those 50 devices.\n\n361\n00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:57.180\nNow the problem that we have is simple.\n\n362\n00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:01.280\nThat also means that that\nis kind of the limitation.\n\n363\n00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.360\nYou can't go to a 51st computer and\ngo, I'm gonna connect in using RDS.\n\n364\n00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.890\nIt's just not gonna work, okay.\n\n365\n00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.280\nSo that is what we wanna make sure of.\n\n366\n00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.660\nSo with those 50 that we assign and\nthat we connect in with a spy.\n\n367\n00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.470\nThe 51st computer is not going\nto make that connection.\n\n368\n00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:23.310\n&gt;&gt; So what you're saying is if I have\n50 desktop computers, all configured in\n\n369\n00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:29.680\nthe little cubicles, I can't go home on my\nlaptop and then try to remote in via RDS?\n\n370\n00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, as long as the,\nyeah, if that becomes\n\n371\n00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:36.100\nthe 51st computer that you didn't license,\nyou're kind of out of luck.\n\n372\n00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.150\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Okay?\n\n373\n00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.520\nNow the advantage of that.\n\n374\n00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.830\nWhat is the big advantage of that?\n\n375\n00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.565\nCherokee, you were giving\nme an example earlier.\n\n376\n00:20:42.565 --> 00:20:45.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So\nI actually worked in an environment.\n\n377\n00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:49.905\nIt was a manufacturing environment,\nand they had three shifts.\n\n378\n00:20:49.905 --> 00:20:52.419\nThey had the first shift,\nsecond shift and third shit.\n\n379\n00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:56.778\nSo for those individuals, those cubicles,\nthey only use their desktop computers.\n\n380\n00:20:56.778 --> 00:21:01.766\nSo as those employees rotated,\nit would make more sense\n\n381\n00:21:01.766 --> 00:21:06.345\nto only go by per device COW\n&gt;&gt; And that does make sense, right,\n\n382\n00:21:06.345 --> 00:21:09.235\nif you know exactly that\nthose are the only machines\n\n383\n00:21:09.235 --> 00:21:13.760\nyou're ever going to use to connect\nback to your remote desktop service.\n\n384\n00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.020\nThen that is the way to go, okay?\n\n385\n00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.020\nBut in today's world, we've also\nfound out something over time and\n\n386\n00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:25.110\nwhich is we no longer stay connected\nto one machine just about any more.\n\n387\n00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:28.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and someone even in chat earlier,\nthey were asking about mobile devices.\n\n388\n00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.130\nSo I mean, a lot of people have\na mix of different devices that\n\n389\n00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:32.880\nthey're using to connect back into.\n\n390\n00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's amazing, just even\ntalking about in generic terms, right?\n\n391\n00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.010\nThe very fact that we used to think,\nwell, our one machine.\n\n392\n00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:42.280\nThat's the one IP address\nwe have on our network.\n\n393\n00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.230\nOr right now just in front\nof you right now, okay.\n\n394\n00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:49.870\nThere's at least with my phone and\nmy virtual machines and\n\n395\n00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:52.330\nmy laptop are going right now.\n\n396\n00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:58.120\nI'm at least taking up three IP addresses\non my network on three different devices.\n\n397\n00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.870\nSometimes you just don't think about that,\n\n398\n00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:03.020\nthat we've actually expanded\nthe way that we've done networking.\n\n399\n00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:08.010\nSo this per device type of connection is\ngood if you know that that's what you\n\n400\n00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:11.120\nwanna do, you wanna set your limitation\nto whatever you want to set and\n\n401\n00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.540\nthat only those devices are gonna be\nused for that type of connection.\n\n402\n00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.830\nThe other type of COW\nthat you have access to,\n\n403\n00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:20.140\nis what we call a per user COW instead.\n\n404\n00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:25.730\nNow, per user COW, it doesn't matter\nhow many devices they connect to, okay?\n\n405\n00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:28.680\nSo Cherokee could be on her laptop,\n\n406\n00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:32.060\nthen she could actually come\nover to my laptop, okay?\n\n407\n00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:37.770\nShe could go to any number of machines and\nlog in as long as she logs in as Cherokee,\n\n408\n00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:41.340\nthat's her using her per user account.\n\n409\n00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.360\nSo it doesn't matter if\nCherokee logs in three,\n\n410\n00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.410\nfour, five times on different machines.\n\n411\n00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:47.890\nAs long as it's her doing it.\n\n412\n00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.740\nNow she should actually go from\none machine to the next machine to\n\n413\n00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:51.640\nthe next machine.\n\n414\n00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.360\nNot concurrently logging in to five.\n\n415\n00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:56.180\n&gt;&gt; You might have some kind of group\npolicy that'll prohibit you in that way.\n\n416\n00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.620\nBut that's a separate configuration.\n\n417\n00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.851\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but that's the idea, right,\n\n418\n00:22:59.851 --> 00:23:03.830\nis that we're no longer limited\nby that one device anymore.\n\n419\n00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.410\nSo, in the per device,\n\n420\n00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:09.660\nif Cherokee needed to connect back to her\ndesktop on remote desktop services, well,\n\n421\n00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.670\nthat mean she has to go back to\noriginal machine to connect in.\n\n422\n00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:17.270\nWell, if Cherokee is now having to do\nsomething, let's say, on my machine.\n\n423\n00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.150\nIt's like, God, I really need to do this.\n\n424\n00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:23.560\nWhat she can view is the remote desktop\nconnection and connect in using mine and\n\n425\n00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.570\nit should still be as far as she's\nlogged out of the other one.\n\n426\n00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:27.950\nShe should still be able\nto bring it up on mine and\n\n427\n00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:31.150\nthat doesn't take away the 50 years or\nlicensing at that point.\n\n428\n00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:32.530\nSo it's not about concurrency.\n\n429\n00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:34.090\nI know that it's a strange term.\n\n430\n00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.540\nAnd I was known that five times\nthat Cherokee can log in.\n\n431\n00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:37.800\nThey're not talking about that.\n\n432\n00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.800\nIs to very fact is that\nnow Cherokee can do that.\n\n433\n00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.102\nNow you might be wondering\nwhy is that important?\n\n434\n00:23:43.102 --> 00:23:47.630\nWell it's important because that's just\nthe way that networking is done today.\n\n435\n00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.080\nWe don't tend to stay locked\ndown to one only machine.\n\n436\n00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.380\nNot saying you can't lock somebody down\nto it but we don't tend to do that, okay?\n\n437\n00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.534\nSo let's take a look here at\nthis idea of the code, okay?\n\n438\n00:23:58.534 --> 00:24:00.567\nNow, when we take a look\nhere at this code,\n\n439\n00:24:00.567 --> 00:24:04.185\nI'm gonna enter in a couple different\nlicenses, is what I'm going to do But\n\n440\n00:24:04.185 --> 00:24:07.916\nwe're not gonna actually do it on air\nbecause I'm not supposed to reveal those\n\n441\n00:24:07.916 --> 00:24:11.008\nlicenses to you, they're supposed\nto be for my organization.\n\n442\n00:24:11.008 --> 00:24:14.230\n&gt;&gt; Good idea [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So that is what's gonna happen here.\n\n443\n00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:18.280\nSo we are going to hide\nthe entering in of the code\n\n444\n00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.920\nby doing a small brief-\n&gt;&gt; TV time out.\n\n445\n00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.610\n&gt;&gt; Time out, yep.\n\n446\n00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:23.570\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n447\n00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:26.990\nAll right, so I've just added in a couple\nof different licensings in here.\n\n448\n00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.300\nI hid the license as much as possible.\n\n449\n00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.230\nI'm trying not to show everybody,\nit's right here in this first column.\n\n450\n00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.190\nAnd now the rest of these\nare actually showing as pending.\n\n451\n00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:39.010\nAnd you should see two different product\ntypes, is what we end up seeing.\n\n452\n00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.690\nSo from here, I click Next.\n\n453\n00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.460\nAnd now it's gonna install\nthose licenses here.\n\n454\n00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.090\nAnd it's gonna take long cuz\nit's reaching out to Microsoft\n\n455\n00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:52.170\nverifying that those are good and whether\nor not they're successful, and it is here.\n\n456\n00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:55.880\nSo, instead of me just choosing one which\n\n457\n00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:00.640\nwould be overriding Cherokee's love\nof the per device type of licensing.\n\n458\n00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.080\nLook at that Cherokee, I implemented both.\n\n459\n00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.270\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; So that we could do that instead.\n\n460\n00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:09.440\nSo now,\nwe have this ability to do this too.\n\n461\n00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.410\nSo you can implement both, which is\nkind of a nice fashion if you want to.\n\n462\n00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:17.090\nBut just realize that this is what\nneeds to happen once they're done.\n\n463\n00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:20.870\nRequested licensings have been\nsuccessfully installed at this point.\n\n464\n00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:26.360\nI simply now click Finish, and\nnow you can see right, oops,\n\n465\n00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:31.630\nlet me scroll that over and then let\nme zoom in just a little bit more.\n\n466\n00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:37.930\nNow you can see Windows Server 2012, and\nthis one it is per device and per CAL.\n\n467\n00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:39.670\nI have a limit of 50, okay?\n\n468\n00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.299\nSo, that's why I was using number\n50 cuz it made sense to me cuz\n\n469\n00:25:42.299 --> 00:25:44.440\nthat's what my licensings were for.\n\n470\n00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.740\nSo, at this point,\n\n471\n00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:49.680\nthat's what you would end up getting as\npeople connect in, we would set this up.\n\n472\n00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:55.530\nNow, the promise is we can’t use both\nat the same time because it's from here\n\n473\n00:25:55.530 --> 00:26:00.380\nthat we would go back in and set up what\nthat licensing inside of our deployment,\n\n474\n00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.310\nand let me see if I can do that right now.\n\n475\n00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:04.804\nI don't think I have to\nswitch on over to RD01 here.\n\n476\n00:26:09.787 --> 00:26:11.950\nThis is where we go\nback into the overview.\n\n477\n00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:18.790\nSo, now that I'm here, I'm gonna\nclick on Edit Deployment Properties.\n\n478\n00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:22.680\nAnd once I'm in Edit Deployment Properties\nover on the left hand side,\n\n479\n00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.610\nnotice where it says RD Licensing.\n\n480\n00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:29.590\nNow, if I select RD Licensing,\neven though I have licenses for\n\n481\n00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:34.000\nboth at this point, notice it doesn't\nallow me to select both of them.\n\n482\n00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.330\nI can either select one or\nthe other to add in my particular license.\n\n483\n00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:45.560\nSo, now could I go to another one,\nif I had a separate licensing server?\n\n484\n00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.980\nProbably and do that one, but just kinda\nrealize that you have this right here,\n\n485\n00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.510\nso it gives me that ability to\nspecify a licensing server or\n\n486\n00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.290\nto remove one if I need to.\n\n487\n00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.910\nSo I'm gonna select the per user at\nthis point and just click Apply.\n\n488\n00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.240\nAnd once that gets applied,\nwe'll just check it out and\n\n489\n00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.010\nsee if we need to add a certificate.\n\n490\n00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:09.220\nAnd if we do, we do, and if we don't, well\nwe don't worry about it too much here.\n\n491\n00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.660\nBut here, let's see, did that?\n\n492\n00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.375\nI'm trying to think if, I think it's done.\n\n493\n00:27:13.375 --> 00:27:15.660\nOkay, yeah, it allowed me to get there.\n\n494\n00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.910\nBut notice it's not requesting\nanother certificate for us.\n\n495\n00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:22.650\nEverything is still trusted and\nready to go.\n\n496\n00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:26.210\nSo that is how we now take that licencing,\n\n497\n00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:30.380\nwe add in the licences,\nexcuse me, that we need to.\n\n498\n00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:34.870\nWe now enable which one we wanna do\nwhether it's per device or per user.\n\n499\n00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:40.660\nAnd then once that's done, we just go back\nand verify that everything is now working.\n\n500\n00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.000\nNow, how do we verify that?\n\n501\n00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.750\nNow, we go back to servers and\n\n502\n00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:48.684\nthen over on the RD01 where\neverybody is connecting in,\n\n503\n00:27:48.684 --> 00:27:53.640\nif I right click on it,\nthere is this option down here.\n\n504\n00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.544\nNow, it didn't appear up here in\nDC01 where the licensing server is,\n\n505\n00:27:57.544 --> 00:27:59.530\nthis here is the licensing manager.\n\n506\n00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:06.460\nIf I go to RD01, and\nI go to Licensing Diagnoser,\n\n507\n00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:12.205\nyou can now see, did not identify\nany licensing problems, hey.\n\n508\n00:28:12.205 --> 00:28:12.830\n&gt;&gt; Woo-hoo.\n\n509\n00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:13.870\n&gt;&gt; That's a good thing.\n\n510\n00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:14.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n511\n00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:15.856\nSo it didn't identify any.\n\n512\n00:28:15.856 --> 00:28:19.435\nAnd now sees the 50 licenses available for\n\n513\n00:28:19.435 --> 00:28:21.079\nthe clients here and\n\n514\n00:28:21.079 --> 00:28:26.260\nnotice it tells me what mode I\nam choosing to be able to do so.\n\n515\n00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.770\nSo, at this point,\nyou are now ready to go.\n\n516\n00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:31.560\nThe only other option\nthat I can think of that\n\n517\n00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:36.260\nI was actually just thinking of this right\naway here and let me check one more thing.\n\n518\n00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.030\nCan we change it?\n\n519\n00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:38.080\nThat's what I don't know.\n\n520\n00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.800\nLet's go to Edit Task.\n\n521\n00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.720\nThat's what I wanted to see cuz I've\nnever changed it once I've set it up.\n\n522\n00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.290\nSo what do you think, Cherokee?\n\n523\n00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:46.790\nYou think,\ncan we change it if we wanted to?\n\n524\n00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:47.840\nWhat do you think?\n\n525\n00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.460\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\nYeah,\n\n526\n00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.820\nthere's gonna be a migration\nprocess somewhere, right?\n\n527\n00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.140\n&gt;&gt; No, all you have to do is\nselect backup the licensing.\n\n528\n00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.032\nAnd notice it's not grayed out, so I can\nchange it even right here if I wanted to.\n\n529\n00:28:58.032 --> 00:29:01.165\nSo, if you choose to at one point,\nchange it, and\n\n530\n00:29:01.165 --> 00:29:02.489\nthe other-\n&gt;&gt; I thought meant change\n\n531\n00:29:02.489 --> 00:29:03.189\nthe location for this instance.\n\n532\n00:29:03.189 --> 00:29:04.214\n&gt;&gt; Nah,\nI'm not worried about changing location.\n\n533\n00:29:04.214 --> 00:29:05.363\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We can simply do that by\n\n534\n00:29:05.363 --> 00:29:05.872\nadding in a new server.\n\n535\n00:29:05.872 --> 00:29:07.001\nBut overall though,\n\n536\n00:29:07.001 --> 00:29:10.649\nnotice that we can change even license\ntype if we want to if we want to.\n\n537\n00:29:10.649 --> 00:29:15.590\nSo it gives you that ability to do so\nand so it's a great process.\n\n538\n00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:20.500\nBut once all that is set up,\nyou now have a single server deployment.\n\n539\n00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.540\nI know, we did add in that second one.\n\n540\n00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:27.130\nBut we don't normally put everything on\nthe domain controller the way that we did.\n\n541\n00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:32.760\nBut at the same time, now everything is\nregistered and you are now ready to go and\n\n542\n00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:37.690\nready to do some real testing out in the\nreal world, and get everything configured\n\n543\n00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:41.660\nand ready to use remote desktop\nservices with a single server.\n\n544\n00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.918\nAnd that's kinda neat to actually\nget all that setup and ready to go.\n\n545\n00:29:44.918 --> 00:29:47.010\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're compliant now,\nso good to go.\n\n546\n00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:49.970\nThank you so much for taking the time\nto show us how to go ahead and\n\n547\n00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:52.800\nset up our licensing server,\nour licensing manager.\n\n548\n00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.940\nAnd thank you, ladies and gentlemen for\nturning in, but stay tuned,\n\n549\n00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.150\nwe do have more remote desktop\nservices headed your way.\n\n550\n00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:01.190\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this show.\n\n551\n00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:02.500\nRemember I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n552\n00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.953\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n553\n00:30:04.953 --> 00:30:13.187\n[MUSIC]\n\n554\n00:30:13.187

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:12.110\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.020\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nRemote Desktop Services show.\n\n6\n00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.160\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.900\nIn this episode,\nwe will be examining how to deploy\n\n8\n00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.680\na connection broker to\nprovide high availability.\n\n9\n00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.080\nWith us today, in studio,\nwe have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.215\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:27.215 --> 00:00:31.166\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back as\nwe continue on in our series right here\n\n12\n00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.490\nfor remote desktop services.\n\n13\n00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.500\nWhen we first began, Cherokee, you and\n\n14\n00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.010\nI started building just\na single server deployment.\n\n15\n00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.760\nAnd that works in a pinch, right?\n\n16\n00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.650\nIf you don't have a lot of resources,\nif you're a small company, we showed you,\n\n17\n00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.430\nessentially, how to get everything\nset up so it can work and provide for\n\n18\n00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.270\nyou what you need access to.\n\n19\n00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.735\nNow, the problem with a single-server\ndeployment is simple,\n\n20\n00:00:53.735 --> 00:00:56.380\nis that there is a single server.\n\n21\n00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.120\nSo what that normally means then is\nif something happened to that server,\n\n22\n00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.300\nit's not just one role that goes down,\n\n23\n00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.090\nand you can simply replace it,\nit's the entire server.\n\n24\n00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.940\nSo everything in your remote desktop\nservices may go down completely.\n\n25\n00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.420\nAnd that brings everybody offline and\ndoesn't give us what we\n\n26\n00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.080\nneed a lot of times when we actually need\nsomething, like remote desktop services.\n\n27\n00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.940\nSo instead, the way that we\nnormally try to deploy this,\n\n28\n00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.690\nof course, is now gonna be using,\nwell, something else, right?\n\n29\n00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.258\nThe ability to spread out those\nroles just a little bit more.\n\n30\n00:01:28.258 --> 00:01:32.106\nThe ability to have what we call\nload balancing if we need to.\n\n31\n00:01:32.106 --> 00:01:33.411\nThe ability to have fault tolerance.\n\n32\n00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:36.640\nSo if one server fails,\nthe other one picks up again.\n\n33\n00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.113\nSo this is where we come into the realm\nof what we call high availability, or\n\n34\n00:01:41.113 --> 00:01:43.110\nthe idea of clustering.\n\n35\n00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.550\nNow, just when I say that term clustering,\nthe terminology has changed over time.\n\n36\n00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.330\nSo in previous iterations,\nsuch as terminal servers, services back in\n\n37\n00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.310\nServer 2008 and even earlier, the idea\nof clustering was kind of the key.\n\n38\n00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.550\nAnd even though I might have referred\nto clustering before during the show,\n\n39\n00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.970\nwe're really talking about a concept that\nnow in Server 2012, they're saying, well,\n\n40\n00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.250\nit's not really truly clustering anymore.\n\n41\n00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.779\nWe don't tend to use a network\nload-balancer to help us to do a lot.\n\n42\n00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:17.367\nBut today, it really is just about\nconfiguring for high availability.\n\n43\n00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:20.861\nSo they've tried to work it out to where\nit's actually a little bit better for\n\n44\n00:02:20.861 --> 00:02:22.711\nwhat we normally need the services for.\n\n45\n00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:24.082\nAnd in that sense,\n\n46\n00:02:24.082 --> 00:02:30.330\nlet me kind of give you an instance of why\nthis is a better solution than before.\n\n47\n00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.904\nSo in previous iterations of terminal\nservices, or the idea of remote desktop\n\n48\n00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:39.940\nservices, we always had what we called\nan active/passive type of cluster.\n\n49\n00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.690\nAnd this essentially meant that\neverybody really just connected to\n\n50\n00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.810\none of those servers, and the other one\nwould kind of stay in the background.\n\n51\n00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.750\nAnd then if something else happened,\nthen the other server would kick in and\n\n52\n00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.060\ntake over.\n\n53\n00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.600\nAnd even though that provided for\n\n54\n00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.570\nus a little bit of what we needed,\nwhich was the idea of failover,\n\n55\n00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.480\nit really didn’t help to do the idea\nof scalability of what we really need.\n\n56\n00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.750\nWhich is, of course,\nthe ability to handle more and\n\n57\n00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.140\nmore loads as my company\ncontinues to grow.\n\n58\n00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.900\nSo instead, now in Server 2012 with RDS,\n\n59\n00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.430\nwe can actually implement what they\ncall an active/active cluster,\n\n60\n00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.750\nper se, in which both servers\ncan actually handle the load.\n\n61\n00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.470\nSo when we start talking about the idea\nof high availability in this sense,\n\n62\n00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.090\nwe're ensuring for failover and\nfor scalability at the same time.\n\n63\n00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.470\nAnd that is what we really want to\nimplement and get set up and started.\n\n64\n00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.100\nNow, there were a couple ways that I could\nhave started to bring this show to you,\n\n65\n00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.450\nwhich was to try and\n\n66\n00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.170\nreconfigure what we had already set up so\nthat we don't have a lot of work to do.\n\n67\n00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.190\nBut normally, when you begin and\n\n68\n00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.480\nyou start working with a customer,\nthat's where you start off.\n\n69\n00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.630\nSo in the first scenario, essentially,\nwe kind of said here it is, we're a small\n\n70\n00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.740\ncompany, and we just need to get this\ndone and started and see what happens.\n\n71\n00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.290\nBut now, as we go on to,\nlet's say, to another customer and\n\n72\n00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.860\nthey're saying we need this idea,\nwe need the idea of load balancing.\n\n73\n00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.660\nWe need this idea of being able to have\nfailover provided and the scaling that we\n\n74\n00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.850\nneed because we know that our company is\ngonna be growing in the next year or so.\n\n75\n00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.748\nWell, on that single-server deployment\nthat we did earlier when we built that\n\n76\n00:04:21.748 --> 00:04:25.740\nsingle server,\nit really can only be limited so much so.\n\n77\n00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.870\nWe can try and add in a second server and\nkind of get it in, but\n\n78\n00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.870\nif we didn't start off with the planning\nof it, it makes it much more difficult.\n\n79\n00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.400\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nstart at the beginning this time,\n\n80\n00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.840\nand we're gonna choose some different\noptions that gives us more granularity\n\n81\n00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.940\nthan what we need.\n\n82\n00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.200\nSo my lab has changed a little bit where\nI've added in a second RDS server,\n\n83\n00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.330\nis what I've done.\n\n84\n00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.860\nSo now, instead of actually\nworking with one server,\n\n85\n00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.226\nwe're gonna be working\nwith two servers instead.\n\n86\n00:04:51.226 --> 00:04:55.534\nAnd we're gonna start that deployment\nover, and then we'll start configuring for\n\n87\n00:04:55.534 --> 00:04:59.260\nthe high availability,\nespecially on this connection-broker idea.\n\n88\n00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.770\nAnd this is the key\ncomponent inside of RDS for\n\n89\n00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.910\nus and Windows Server 2012 is that we\nneed to start off clustering with that\n\n90\n00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.430\nbecause that's what decides\nwhere things go, right?\n\n91\n00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.899\nThe connection broker's what decides where\nthe client's gonna get shuffled off to,\n\n92\n00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:15.666\nand that's why we wanna start right there.\n\n93\n00:05:15.666 --> 00:05:17.186\nAnd that's the way we're gonna do.\n\n94\n00:05:17.186 --> 00:05:19.799\nAnd then later on we'll bring in,\nactually,\n\n95\n00:05:19.799 --> 00:05:22.890\nbeing able to load balance\nbetween the session hosts.\n\n96\n00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.170\nBut for right now,\nlet's just start off with that.\n\n97\n00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.410\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So here it is.\n\n98\n00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.780\nLet's go back to my screen, and we'll\nbegin with the deployment idea, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:37.180\nSo here on my screen, I am actually on my\ndomain controller right here, on DC01.\n\n100\n00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.270\nAnd we're simply gonna start adding in\neverything that we learned about in\n\n101\n00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.690\nthe previous episodes, but\n\n102\n00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.570\nwe're gonna choose a couple of different\noptions as we go through here, okay?\n\n103\n00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.080\nSo the first thing that I wanna do\nhere now that everything is up,\n\n104\n00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.118\nI need to make sure that the machine\nthat I have of course are domain joined,\n\n105\n00:05:51.118 --> 00:05:55.810\nthey're installed with Windows Server\n2012, and everything is ready to go.\n\n106\n00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.230\nBut we're gonna see that we're gonna have\nto add in a little bit more if we want to\n\n107\n00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.580\ndo this idea of clustering here.\n\n108\n00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.300\nOne, of course, is that we're gonna take\na look here, after we get some things\n\n109\n00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.990\ninstalled, started here, is that we're\ngonna need to install a SQL Server.\n\n110\n00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.375\nNow the great thing is if you\nalready have a SQL Server running,\n\n111\n00:06:13.375 --> 00:06:14.681\nyou don't have to worry about it.\n\n112\n00:06:14.681 --> 00:06:16.913\nAll you have to do is kind of\nchange a few configurations,\n\n113\n00:06:16.913 --> 00:06:19.730\nand we'll show you what\nconfigurations you have to change.\n\n114\n00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.201\nBut if you don't, you have to install\nthat, and you'll have to get it up and\n\n115\n00:06:23.201 --> 00:06:25.767\nrunning and make sure that\nthat connection can be seen.\n\n116\n00:06:25.767 --> 00:06:29.240\nAnd you'll have to deal with a little\nbit of active directory groups too.\n\n117\n00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.785\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie,\nwe didn't install a SQL Server previously.\n\n118\n00:06:31.785 --> 00:06:33.860\nIs that something we're gonna\nbe looking at in a few minutes?\n\n119\n00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:34.418\n&gt;&gt; We are.\n\n120\n00:06:34.418 --> 00:06:36.070\n&gt;&gt; Cool.\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna actually end up taking\n\n121\n00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.490\na look at that, but I'm not gonna do\na full-blown SQL Server installation.\n\n122\n00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.543\nFor our proof of concept,\nI'm just gonna use SQL Express.\n\n123\n00:06:42.543 --> 00:06:45.095\nAnd even though I'm gonna\nsay it should be quicker,\n\n124\n00:06:45.095 --> 00:06:48.404\nthere's no guarantee in\nthe installation process it's quicker.\n\n125\n00:06:48.404 --> 00:06:51.964\nNow, this does change the hardware\nconfiguration a little bit.\n\n126\n00:06:51.964 --> 00:06:54.420\nI'm gonna install it onto\nthis domain controller, but\n\n127\n00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.130\nwe're gonna do it after\na couple of processes here.\n\n128\n00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.630\nBut it does require usually at least\nfour gigs of RAM on your SQL Server.\n\n129\n00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.370\nSo make sure you put it on\na machine with four gigs RAM, or\n\n130\n00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.830\ncheck out whatever\nthe minimum requirements are.\n\n131\n00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.550\nIf you already have a SQL Server up and\nrunning,\n\n132\n00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.860\njust make sure you can connect to that\nSQL Server, and that is gonna be the key.\n\n133\n00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.860\nThen we'll actually see some other\nelements that we have to add\n\n134\n00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.280\ninto the remote desktop services\n\n135\n00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.090\nservers to be able to connect\nback to that SQL Server as well.\n\n136\n00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.990\nBecause in clustering,\nwe need that database.\n\n137\n00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.900\nEven though there's a Windows Internal\nDatabase that can be used with\n\n138\n00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:35.040\na single-server deployment scenario, once\nyou start now having multiple machines\n\n139\n00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.750\ndoing this, now you're gonna actually\nneed something a little bit more robust.\n\n140\n00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.270\nSo I'm just gonna use a SQL Server\nExpress, like I said, to kind of really at\n\n141\n00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.240\nleast show you the implementation\nof it at the beginning here.\n\n142\n00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.274\nSo let's go ahead and start by installing,\nwell, the role that we need.\n\n143\n00:07:51.274 --> 00:07:53.952\nSo once I'm actually\non the server manager,\n\n144\n00:07:53.952 --> 00:07:57.972\nI'm on the dashboard,\nI'm gonna click on Add roles and features.\n\n145\n00:07:57.972 --> 00:07:59.316\nAnd before I do that.\n\n146\n00:07:59.316 --> 00:08:03.165\nI realize I forgot something right away\nCherokee which is I can't manage those\n\n147\n00:08:03.165 --> 00:08:06.162\nservers if they're not actually\npart of my server manager.\n\n148\n00:08:06.162 --> 00:08:08.370\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; So, let me go ahead and make sure.\n\n149\n00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:09.960\nSo, all servers and\n\n150\n00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.280\nnow you can actually see where I've\nadded in already those picker servers.\n\n151\n00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:20.220\nI tried to keep my lab environment fairly\nsimple notice I sequenced my IP addresses.\n\n152\n00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.740\nAnd that's just easy for me to remember.\n\n153\n00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.820\nNow, if you don't wanna do that you can\nmake whatever IP address fit your scheme\n\n154\n00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.620\nand need, but this is just\nsomething simple of us to remember.\n\n155\n00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.470\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie did you add them\nall to the server pool,\n\n156\n00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.310\neven if you're just kind of your\n&gt;&gt; You did previously?\n\n157\n00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:35.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Just hit all.\n\n158\n00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.960\nIt's okay.\nI still find myself, I always hit File,\n\n159\n00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.710\nSave As.\n\n160\n00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.270\nWell, I don't want to say always,\nbut I usually hit that also.\n\n161\n00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.770\nThose little details, right?\n\n162\n00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSo yeah, I still do that.\n\n163\n00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:48.310\nEven though I know that it\nalready originally had DCO1, and\n\n164\n00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.960\nall I had to do was add in RDO1 and\n\n165\n00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.400\nRDO2, I still add them all in because\nit's just something I've always done.\n\n166\n00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.870\n&gt;&gt; It'd probably waste a little\nbit of time but overall, though,\n\n167\n00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.050\nit makes me feel better.\n\n168\n00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.060\nI don't know if it really does anything,\nit probably doesn't.\n\n169\n00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.980\nPeople are probably saying,\nyou're just wasting compute cycles.\n\n170\n00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:05.925\nBut, I'm wasting.\n\n171\n00:09:05.925 --> 00:09:07.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's go ahead and\n\n172\n00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.440\nselect Add Roles.\n\n173\n00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.930\nOnce I select the Add Roles in\nthe Add Roles and Feature Wizard,\n\n174\n00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.400\nthis is where we've already done the\nmajority of this We're simply gonna select\n\n175\n00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.100\nthe second option, where it says add\nremote desktop services installation.\n\n176\n00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.680\nI'm gonna click next, and\nthis is where we're gonna make a change.\n\n177\n00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.120\nIn the previous single server environment\nthat we did, we selected this quick start\n\n178\n00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.690\nwhich said hey, let me go ahead and\njust add these on, and make them all work.\n\n179\n00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.610\nAnd do everything that we need to.\n\n180\n00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.380\nGet some of the configuration going.\n\n181\n00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.710\nThis time though,\nI want to choose a standard deployment.\n\n182\n00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.720\nOkay, that's usually the one that you're\ngonna choose anyways when you do this.\n\n183\n00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.850\nEspecially when you work\nwith multiple servers here.\n\n184\n00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:51.960\nAnd this allows you then to control this\na little bit better than just going, okay.\n\n185\n00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.050\nHere's all the roles that\ncan be installed on one.\n\n186\n00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:58.090\nIf I had multiple clusters I can now\nseparate out the connection broker.\n\n187\n00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:02.020\nFrom the remote gateway, from\nthe session host server, if I had five,\n\n188\n00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:05.930\nsix server I could just distribute\nall that out if I wanted to.\n\n189\n00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.511\nEven installing from right here which is\npretty darn cool I still that's one of\n\n190\n00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:14.260\nthe neatest features about this sort of\nas it came online is that ability too not\n\n191\n00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.910\nhave to change to every single server I\nneeded to go to and install the roles.\n\n192\n00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.520\n&gt;&gt; Now, this is different from the way\nthat we had previously installed.\n\n193\n00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.330\nWe used the Quick Start whenever we\nwere setting it up the first time.\n\n194\n00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.410\n&gt;&gt; Yep, that is absolutely correct.\n\n195\n00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.380\nAnd that one just says,\nlet me make most of the decisions for you.\n\n196\n00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.940\nThis time it's gonna say, Ronnie,\nyou're gonna make the decisions instead.\n\n197\n00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:33.960\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So, here we go,\n\n198\n00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.490\nwe have now this ability, of course,\nto select which environment that we want.\n\n199\n00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:44.660\nAt this point I'm still gonna select the\nsession-based desktop deployment instead.\n\n200\n00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.620\nRemember that if I have a virtual\nmachine-based deployment, this says what's\n\n201\n00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.400\ngonna happen is Cherokee logs in that\nshe's gonna have her own virtual machine.\n\n202\n00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.030\nAnd everything is gonna be saved for\nher, and that's gonna be separate.\n\n203\n00:10:56.030 --> 00:11:00.840\nAs if I log in and I end up having\nanother virtual machine instead.\n\n204\n00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.930\nIn the session-based, all\nthe information is kept separately, but\n\n205\n00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.470\nwe're really launching one virtual\nmachine when it comes out.\n\n206\n00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.390\nAt least that's what it feels\ncuz you're creating a session\n\n207\n00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.340\nis all that you're doing.\n\n208\n00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.730\nSo this one's gonna be a little\nbit more efficient for\n\n209\n00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:14.040\nwhat we want to do at this point.\n\n210\n00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.550\nWe're gonna click next from here and now\nit says look, here's the role services.\n\n211\n00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.770\nThe same thing that we saw on\nthe QuickStart which is great for us.\n\n212\n00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:25.320\nWe need the Connection Broker installed,\nthe desktop web access and\n\n213\n00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.910\nof course even the session desktop or\nthe session host.\n\n214\n00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.790\nSo we're gonna slide next here.\n\n215\n00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.110\nNow, it's gonna ask me which\nparticular server we want.\n\n216\n00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.840\nNow when you start thinking about this,\nall right,\n\n217\n00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.560\nI know I'm gonna be clustering this.\n\n218\n00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.780\nSo, should I add in both of them?\n\n219\n00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.900\nNo, it's gonna actually want\nyou to do it on one first.\n\n220\n00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.450\nSo, I'm simply gonna pick kind\nof exactly what we did before.\n\n221\n00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.590\nI'm gonna use RD1 as\nconfiguring everything for\n\n222\n00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:53.530\nmy high availability at the beginning.\n\n223\n00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.980\nAnd then,\nwe'll use RD2 to add that into our cluster\n\n224\n00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.080\nis what we'll end up seeing here.\n\n225\n00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.910\nSo, I'm gonna select that first one.\n\n226\n00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:03.140\nMake sure that's RD1.\n\n227\n00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:06.760\nAlso on the web access I'm\ngonna do the same thing.\n\n228\n00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.177\nI'm gonna add in RD1 as well.\n\n229\n00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:15.821\nFrom here and notice that there's\nactually a couple of other options that\n\n230\n00:12:15.821 --> 00:12:21.240\nare available,says install the already web\naccess role on the connection server or\n\n231\n00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.853\nthe connection server as well.\n\n232\n00:12:23.853 --> 00:12:26.870\nSo, it give that ability to say look\nif you gonna do this one one,do\n\n233\n00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.640\nyou wanna do it the same way.\n\n234\n00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.420\nSo, we could check and\nmark that if we want to as well and\n\n235\n00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.450\nthat would make sure\nthat that gets installed.\n\n236\n00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:34.070\nDo you have to?\n\n237\n00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:36.990\nNo, you don't have to,\nyou can separate it completely out.\n\n238\n00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:41.680\nAnd I'm RD03, I might choose to install\nthe web access on that one instead.\n\n239\n00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.700\nBut this one, I'll go ahead and\ndo this, too.\n\n240\n00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.080\nAnd the same thing.\n\n241\n00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.670\nI'm just gonna configure it just\nlike we did before everything.\n\n242\n00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:52.980\nEven though it's on one server right\nnow It's fine, we're gonna see how that\n\n243\n00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:57.020\nseparates out when we start and\nmake sure that everything gets configured.\n\n244\n00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.670\nSo, pretty much,\nit's not really a lot different except for\n\n245\n00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:04.390\nI chose if the fact of the standard\ndeployment is what I chose to do.\n\n246\n00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:10.080\nEverything is going onto,\nthe RD01 is what we want.\n\n247\n00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.380\nAnd I'll also need to make\nsure I checkmarked this.\n\n248\n00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:18.130\nIt tells me at least one of these is going\nto need to restart for everything to work.\n\n249\n00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.180\nSo, I simply select deploy.\n\n250\n00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.290\nAnd now, the installation process\nis going to happen on RD01.\n\n251\n00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.500\nNow, this takes just a moment or two.\n\n252\n00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.830\nBut at least at the beginning here.\n\n253\n00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:31.570\nWe start noticing that everything\nis actually where we want it to be.\n\n254\n00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:35.480\nWhich is getting it ready for\nall these services, okay.\n\n255\n00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.970\nNow, once we had that up and\nrunning, it was very easy for\n\n256\n00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.770\nus in previous shows to show where\nwe could connect right away.\n\n257\n00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:44.350\nBut we still have to worry\nabout some security.\n\n258\n00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.470\nWe still have to worry about\ndoing some certificates.\n\n259\n00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:51.010\nThere's still a lot for us to go through,\nbut during the installation process,\n\n260\n00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:52.080\nthis is fairly simple.\n\n261\n00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.560\nNow, because we are setting this up,\n\n262\n00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.440\nthen, for the connection broker\nto be highly available, we now\n\n263\n00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:05.370\nhave to realize that we have to involve\nthat SQL Server in the process, okay?\n\n264\n00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:10.150\nThis is where you do need to install this\nSQL Server in, if you don't have it.\n\n265\n00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:13.580\nNow you can install this on a separate\nmachine and that's recommended or\n\n266\n00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.430\nif you have another one that's\nalready running on your network,\n\n267\n00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:18.920\njust make sure you have it up and going.\n\n268\n00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.200\nWhat's gonna need to happen\nhere with the connection broker\n\n269\n00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.200\nis the connection broker's gonna need to\nget access to the SQL Server engine, so\n\n270\n00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.920\nit can create a database of\nthose connections for us.\n\n271\n00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.430\nSo it's a little bit strange\nin which we're not gonna be\n\n272\n00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.260\nmanually creating the database.\n\n273\n00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:39.120\nBut the connection broker itself, when\nconnections happen, it will go ahead and\n\n274\n00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:45.920\ncreate a database, so that we can get\nthose connections doing what we need to.\n\n275\n00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.390\nSo that is gonna be our next particular\n\n276\n00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:52.410\nConnection that we need to install and\nget done.\n\n277\n00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.370\nBut right now, we just have to wait for\nthis one to finish.\n\n278\n00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:59.550\nNow when we install in this SQL Server,\nespecially with the express,\n\n279\n00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:03.250\nwe need to have a, there's a few\nprerequisites that we need to install.\n\n280\n00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:08.300\nAnd one of them is actually\ngonna be the .NET framework 3.5.\n\n281\n00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.440\nCould I have added it in here?\n\n282\n00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.190\nYes, but at the same time,\n\n283\n00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:13.810\nI wanted to see if this would\nactually go faster without it.\n\n284\n00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.910\nSo, what's gonna happen is\nthis thing's gonna restart,\n\n285\n00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.280\nat least the session host\nserver's gonna restart.\n\n286\n00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.140\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go to vacation?\n\n287\n00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.860\n&gt;&gt; The rest of this should be,\nvery quickly, yup.\n\n288\n00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.350\nI should be finished in just moment here.\n\n289\n00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:28.370\nSo I normally install\nthe .NET Framework next\n\n290\n00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.630\nto make sure everything is ready to go.\n\n291\n00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:34.515\nBecause if not it has to wait till SQL\nServer the SQL Server then has to check\n\n292\n00:15:34.515 --> 00:15:38.962\nand verify that it's there, and it goes\nit's not there, let me install it now and\n\n293\n00:15:38.962 --> 00:15:41.532\n[INAUDIBLE] they are gonna\nask you to download it or\n\n294\n00:15:41.532 --> 00:15:45.447\nit's gonna say where is the source\nof your .net framework source files.\n\n295\n00:15:45.447 --> 00:15:49.731\nSo that's some other things that you\nend up seeing, but overall though,\n\n296\n00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:54.448\nif you install it separately by itself It\nwill help and it will work out just fine.\n\n297\n00:15:54.448 --> 00:15:55.920\nSo there we go, okay.\n\n298\n00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.685\nAnd so, the entire thing is now installed\nand now those roles are configured for\n\n299\n00:16:00.685 --> 00:16:02.331\nRemote Desktop Services.\n\n300\n00:16:02.331 --> 00:16:05.817\nYou can see over in the navigation pane,\nRemote Desktop Services showed up.\n\n301\n00:16:08.002 --> 00:16:12.523\nAnd now I can see on the Overview that,\njust like before, we have all those roles\n\n302\n00:16:12.523 --> 00:16:17.650\nexcept for the Remote Desktop Gateway and\nLicensing server up and ready to go.\n\n303\n00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.802\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n304\n00:16:20.802 --> 00:16:25.370\nget the .NET3.5 added in.\n\n305\n00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:28.520\nSo I'm just launching that add roles and\nfeature wizard.\n\n306\n00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.791\nThis time I'm gonna select the DCO1,\n\n307\n00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:34.374\nwhere I'm gonna be installing\nthe SQL Server database.\n\n308\n00:16:36.548 --> 00:16:40.522\nAnd now I'm not gonna worry about\npicking any additional roles here,\n\n309\n00:16:40.522 --> 00:16:42.570\nbecause what I need is a feature.\n\n310\n00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:46.278\nSo if I select Next, there it is,\nthe .NET Framework 3.5.\n\n311\n00:16:46.278 --> 00:16:49.940\nAnd that's because I've chosen to\ninstall SQL Server Express 2012,\n\n312\n00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.220\nto try and match everything up.\n\n313\n00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.780\nAnd select Restart if needed.\n\n314\n00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:58.147\nThe other thing I need to do right here,\n\n315\n00:16:58.147 --> 00:17:01.332\nyou'll notice something in\nthis yellow bar, right.\n\n316\n00:17:01.332 --> 00:17:04.164\nIt says, do you need to specify\nan alternate source path?\n\n317\n00:17:04.164 --> 00:17:07.071\nOkay, so you might, but\nif you do this, it means,\n\n318\n00:17:07.071 --> 00:17:09.720\nhey it didn't install like .NET framework.\n\n319\n00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:14.080\nSo it's saying where is your source CD\nthat's what it's essentially looking for.\n\n320\n00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.570\nIt's down here at the bottom where\nyou specify an alternate source path.\n\n321\n00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:22.660\n&gt;&gt; We really don't need a CD, we can use\nlike a network share or a shared location.\n\n322\n00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.245\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, absolutely, yup.\n\n323\n00:17:23.245 --> 00:17:23.745\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n324\n00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:28.075\n&gt;&gt; So here, mine's actually on an ISO so\nthat's why I'm-\n\n325\n00:17:28.075 --> 00:17:29.407\n&gt;&gt; Yep, [LAUGH]\n\n326\n00:17:29.407 --> 00:17:29.963\n&gt;&gt; Fancy.\n\n327\n00:17:29.963 --> 00:17:31.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n328\n00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.940\n&gt;&gt; I didn't\n\n329\n00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.070\nhave a network share in my fake network.\n\n330\n00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:37.588\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That I put my source files in.\n\n331\n00:17:37.588 --> 00:17:43.370\nClick OK And once I do that,\nlet me zoom out.\n\n332\n00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.510\nI'm trying to,\nwhy is that getting all wonky on me.\n\n333\n00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:49.000\nClick Install and there you go.\n\n334\n00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.360\nYou'll be able to install this in.\n\n335\n00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.970\nNow you might find out,\nonce we get everything installed on there,\n\n336\n00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:59.220\nthat's when the configuration of\nthe SQL Server has to happen next as well.\n\n337\n00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:04.590\nSo, I wish I could tell you that this\nwas the easiest process in the world.\n\n338\n00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:08.100\nA lot of it is waiting for\nthe installation part to go through.\n\n339\n00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.450\nBut you'll see right here\nthat at least these parts,\n\n340\n00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:16.484\nthis is why when I normally do this,\nI go ahead and install .NET framework\n\n341\n00:18:16.484 --> 00:18:21.150\n3.5 beforehand which, I probably should\nhave done, but I forgot about it.\n\n342\n00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.319\nSo here we are, we're installing it now.\n\n343\n00:18:23.319 --> 00:18:26.628\nNow once this is done we'll start\ninstalling, of course then,\n\n344\n00:18:26.628 --> 00:18:27.950\nthe SQL Server.\n\n345\n00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:31.440\nAnd there's a couple of other things\nthat we'll need to do over on the other\n\n346\n00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.600\nservers too.\n\n347\n00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.760\nThere's going to be a SQL Client that we\nhave to install that will then connect\n\n348\n00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.540\nto the SQL Server that we have,\nand we'll have to do that as well.\n\n349\n00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.484\nAnd that may require .NET\nframework 3.5 as well.\n\n350\n00:18:42.484 --> 00:18:46.190\nBut we'll see that during\nthe installation process if we need to.\n\n351\n00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:49.157\nSo now,\nwe've got the prerequisite installed.\n\n352\n00:18:49.157 --> 00:18:52.240\nAnd if I have a shared folder,\nwhich I do on my desktop.\n\n353\n00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:54.410\nFor RDS.\n\n354\n00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:03.310\nThe one that I downloaded was\nessentially the SQL Express advanced.\n\n355\n00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:06.360\nNow I tried to get everything that I\nneeded cuz I didn't know which one,\n\n356\n00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.750\ncuz there's multiple offerings.\n\n357\n00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.980\nYou can go out to Microsoft and\ndownload one.\n\n358\n00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:10.882\nThe Express one.\n\n359\n00:19:10.882 --> 00:19:11.479\n&gt;&gt; It still worked.\n\n360\n00:19:11.479 --> 00:19:12.622\n&gt;&gt; It still works.\n\n361\n00:19:12.622 --> 00:19:16.555\nJust pick one, but pick the one that\nhas the most features cuz you can\n\n362\n00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:20.760\nalways uncheck the ones you don't need,\nif you don't need that.\n\n363\n00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.355\nBut it's hard to add in features when you\ndon't have it on the install package.\n\n364\n00:19:24.355 --> 00:19:25.238\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So from right\n\n365\n00:19:25.238 --> 00:19:28.750\nhere I'm gonna run the administrator,\nrun as administrator.\n\n366\n00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.720\nAnd you'll see this process here.\n\n367\n00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.711\nWe're gonna get started with the\ninstallation then we're gonna kind of take\n\n368\n00:19:33.711 --> 00:19:36.563\na little brief time out as it installs\nbecause it may take a few minutes to do\n\n369\n00:19:36.563 --> 00:19:37.633\nthe entire installation.\n\n370\n00:19:37.633 --> 00:19:40.504\nAnd there's no use in you just\nwatching that well, like this,\n\n371\n00:19:40.504 --> 00:19:43.910\nbars go across the screen except\nright here at the beginning.\n\n372\n00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:47.310\nSo that's what else will\nactually end up doing.\n\n373\n00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.260\nNow, we're not completely done yet, right?\n\n374\n00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.870\nSo, once we get the instant install done,\nwe also need to go in and\n\n375\n00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.220\nwe'll have to change some DNS records.\n\n376\n00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:59.570\nWe'll also have to change\nthe certificates that we'll need,\n\n377\n00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:02.610\nbecause we're configuring this now for\nhigh availability.\n\n378\n00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:06.090\nSo, we'll see that there's still a lot\nof options available for us, but\n\n379\n00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.790\nthis is apart of that process of\ngetting everything up and running.\n\n380\n00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.890\nSo there it is now.\n\n381\n00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:13.950\nOnce everything is installing\nin the background,\n\n382\n00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.770\nI was trying to see where it was.\n\n383\n00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.220\nIt says please wait,\nit does take a little bit of time.\n\n384\n00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:23.670\nIf you try and run this on a server\nwith 2 gigs of RAM, it will install.\n\n385\n00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:26.800\nI know cause I did it and\nI did it by accident.\n\n386\n00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.200\nI forgot that I actually need\nat least 4 gigs of RAM to work.\n\n387\n00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.350\nIt will install but\nit will take much longer time for\n\n388\n00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.280\nit to actually do any of\nthe installation process.\n\n389\n00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.550\nOnce we get to the installation,\n\n390\n00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:41.070\nI'm gonna select\nthe New Server Stand Alone installation.\n\n391\n00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:45.710\nAnd every single click, I don't know why,\n\n392\n00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:50.060\nbut it just takes that much time to\nkind of build and do what we need to.\n\n393\n00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.090\nWhat I'm really trying to get to is\nthe options that you really need to make\n\n394\n00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:54.620\nsure that are installed here.\n\n395\n00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.220\nNow you will see that there's not really\na lot of options that we need but\n\n396\n00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.040\nthere are some that we need to\nmake sure that we do chose,\n\n397\n00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.430\nif we're gonna do a stand\nalone installation like this.\n\n398\n00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:08.770\nIf you are already have your SQL Server,\n\n399\n00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:11.450\nthen is is just kind of a move point for\nus.\n\n400\n00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.458\nThe only thing we'll need at that point is\nof course the connections strings to get\n\n401\n00:21:14.458 --> 00:21:16.000\nconnected to that server.\n\n402\n00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.090\nFrom inside of the deployment task,\nis what we'll end up seeing there, okay?\n\n403\n00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:24.370\nSo once this things finishes installing,\nwe'll chose those particular roles, and\n\n404\n00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:25.510\nwe'll hit, Install.\n\n405\n00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:29.980\nAnd then we'll kind of shorten up our time\nduration here, in what needs to happen.\n\n406\n00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.740\nSo it's about to happen here.\n\n407\n00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:36.660\nSo you'll see, even with 4 gigs of RAM,\nit was still kind of a little bit\n\n408\n00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.890\nof a set up in terms of the process\nof doing what we need to.\n\n409\n00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:45.160\nNow, as the installation begins, I'm going\nto accept the licensing agreement, and\n\n410\n00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.350\nclick Next.\n\n411\n00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:48.710\nAnd now it's saying hey,\nI want to check for SQL updates.\n\n412\n00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:51.330\nNow, I'm not actually\nconnected to the internet, so\n\n413\n00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.060\nthat's why I'm getting an error here.\n\n414\n00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:57.950\nBut there is an update, it's like a 12.6\nmegabyte update of something, but\n\n415\n00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:59.900\nI'm not so worried about this process.\n\n416\n00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.050\nIf you're connected to the Internet,\nyou'll be perfectly fine.\n\n417\n00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:06.360\nI've isolated my little lab here so\nwe're not connecting to the Internet.\n\n418\n00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:12.380\nThis is where we'll see the setup and\nthe install process that will start.\n\n419\n00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.690\nAnd then it'll give us the options\nof what we want to include and\n\n420\n00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:19.880\nwhat we don't want to include inside of\nour SQL Server installation here, okay.\n\n421\n00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.460\nNow you might think,\nwhy don't we go ahead and\n\n422\n00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:26.930\nstart installing the client connection\nover on the other two servers?\n\n423\n00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:30.740\nWell without this SQL Server being here,\nit doesn't know exactly what to point to.\n\n424\n00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:35.430\nSo we just have to wait for that, so there\nis some sequencing to the events that\n\n425\n00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:40.575\nhappen for high availability to\nit to occur when we start this.\n\n426\n00:22:40.575 --> 00:22:44.687\nAll right, now the strange thing that\nwe'll actually end up doing is once kind\n\n427\n00:22:44.687 --> 00:22:49.000\nof a SQL server is done, we'll have to go\nthrough the rest of the deployment task.\n\n428\n00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.865\nSuch as getting the right certificate\nthat we need, making sure it has\n\n429\n00:22:53.865 --> 00:22:58.930\nthe of what we want to cluster together,\nmaking sure all that's good.\n\n430\n00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.820\nWe also, of course,\nhave to install those in.\n\n431\n00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:05.100\nWe have to get connected to the SQL Server\nfrom the Remote Connection Broker.\n\n432\n00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.810\nYou'll see everything else\nstill has to be done that way.\n\n433\n00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:09.550\nSo there's a lot more\nconfiguration as far as-\n\n434\n00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:10.510\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like it.\n\n435\n00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:13.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's probably gonna be\nmore than a single part show here.\n\n436\n00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.451\nBut overall though,\nonce we get to this, like I said,\n\n437\n00:23:16.451 --> 00:23:19.235\nwe'll take a little bit of\na break to help us out here.\n\n438\n00:23:19.235 --> 00:23:19.966\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n439\n00:23:19.966 --> 00:23:23.371\n&gt;&gt; Now the other thing that\nwe're gonna end up noticing,\n\n440\n00:23:23.371 --> 00:23:28.033\nand I'm kind of laying this out in\na preview as we're waiting on time here,\n\n441\n00:23:28.033 --> 00:23:30.994\nis that to be able to do\nthis high availability,\n\n442\n00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:35.680\nwe can actually implement a high\navailability cluster of one.\n\n443\n00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.474\nWhich is a little bit strange but\nthat's how you begin,\n\n444\n00:23:38.474 --> 00:23:42.279\nis that you start off with a cluster of\none, which is very strange for us, and\n\n445\n00:23:42.279 --> 00:23:45.929\nthen we can add in additional servers and\nthat will end up helping us out.\n\n446\n00:23:45.929 --> 00:23:49.374\nSo you'll notice here's kind of\nthe longest process that we have\n\n447\n00:23:49.374 --> 00:23:53.068\nin place here, which is just getting\nthis installed end up working and\n\n448\n00:23:53.068 --> 00:23:54.772\ngetting it all up and done here.\n\n449\n00:23:54.772 --> 00:23:58.766\nSo it's running and it's checking\nthe process In just a second here,\n\n450\n00:23:58.766 --> 00:23:59.519\nthere we go.\n\n451\n00:23:59.519 --> 00:24:03.340\nThis is the screen I've been waiting for\nall this time.\n\n452\n00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:05.040\nReally that's all you were waiting for?\n\n453\n00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.590\nIt pretty much is.\n\n454\n00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:09.010\nSo let me scroll in here, okay.\n\n455\n00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.257\nThe great thing is we really\ndon't need the majority of this.\n\n456\n00:24:12.257 --> 00:24:16.147\nSo for example, I don't need the\nreplication, I don't need the full text\n\n457\n00:24:16.147 --> 00:24:20.310\nand semantic extractions for the search\ncuz I'm not gonna be doing any of that.\n\n458\n00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.085\nI don't need the Reporting Services,\n\n459\n00:24:22.085 --> 00:24:24.460\nthe only thing I need is\nthe Database Engine up here.\n\n460\n00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:30.140\nI don't need the Documentation Components.\n\n461\n00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.664\nAnd I do need the Management Tools,\nthough, okay?\n\n462\n00:24:33.664 --> 00:24:38.687\nOn this Client Connectivity SDK,\nI really only need a Client Connectivity,\n\n463\n00:24:38.687 --> 00:24:42.393\nbut the very fact is it doesn't\ngive me that as an option,\n\n464\n00:24:42.393 --> 00:24:47.105\nso I'm gonna leave in this SDK even\nthough it's a little bit larger in its\n\n465\n00:24:47.105 --> 00:24:49.984\ninstall of what it's actually going to do.\n\n466\n00:24:49.984 --> 00:24:54.886\nSo here's the bare minimum features if\nyou're doing this for specifically just\n\n467\n00:24:54.886 --> 00:24:59.008\nfor your RDS, you wanna make sure\nthat those features are in there.\n\n468\n00:24:59.008 --> 00:25:02.651\nDepending on what edition that you have,\njust kinda remember,\n\n469\n00:25:02.651 --> 00:25:06.833\nit's the Database Engine,\nit's gonna be the Connectivity Tools here,\n\n470\n00:25:06.833 --> 00:25:08.587\nthe Client Connectivity, and\n\n471\n00:25:08.587 --> 00:25:12.110\nthen the Basic Data Tools is\nwhat you're really looking for.\n\n472\n00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:17.513\nSelect Next, and that will begin\nthe process and the installation.\n\n473\n00:25:17.513 --> 00:25:20.371\nAnd so\nwe'll see here in just a few minutes,\n\n474\n00:25:20.371 --> 00:25:24.334\nat least in terms of what we'll\nbe doing here on the side.\n\n475\n00:25:24.334 --> 00:25:27.038\nThat actually installed fairly quickly,\nso I lied.\n\n476\n00:25:27.038 --> 00:25:29.370\nI thought we were gonna have\nto take a break here, but\n\n477\n00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:31.510\nnotice it actually\ninstalled fairly quickly.\n\n478\n00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:34.100\nSo that means we can move\non without actually having\n\n479\n00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:38.230\nto worry about a little TV time out,\nwhich I thought we were gonna have to do.\n\n480\n00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.230\nNow, this is where it\ngets a little bit tricky.\n\n481\n00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:44.720\nMost people now would just go next\nnext next next and finish, but\n\n482\n00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.380\nbecause of the way that we have to\nset this up, we have to change this.\n\n483\n00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.831\nThis instance name is\nnot going to work for\n\n484\n00:25:50.831 --> 00:25:55.187\nthe way that we need to because of\nthe way that connection broker is set up.\n\n485\n00:25:55.187 --> 00:26:00.242\nIt's not ready for this, so instead\nwe're gonna choose Default instance,\n\n486\n00:26:00.242 --> 00:26:05.154\nand notice where that changes it to\nMS SQL Server instead, or MSSQL, too.\n\n487\n00:26:05.154 --> 00:26:09.250\nSo you can see that's the only change\nthat we're really making there.\n\n488\n00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:13.280\n&gt;&gt; Now, with that default name, is that\nwhat this system is actually looking for,\n\n489\n00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.930\nor can we choose some random name?\n\n490\n00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:17.210\n&gt;&gt; Nope, this is what this\nsystem is really gonna look for.\n\n491\n00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:19.270\nNow, don't get me wrong,\ncan you change that?\n\n492\n00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:23.410\nAs long as you know exactly where the SQL\nServer was installed, if you chose to\n\n493\n00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:26.820\ninstall it in a different location,\nthen yes, you can change that too.\n\n494\n00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:30.096\nBut you'll need to change the root\ninstance directory if you do that.\n\n495\n00:26:30.096 --> 00:26:30.661\n&gt;&gt; To match.\n\n496\n00:26:30.661 --> 00:26:34.666\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, if you didn't and you're just\ntyping that in, or typing in something,\n\n497\n00:26:34.666 --> 00:26:37.685\nthat's not gonna work, and\nremember that's the key there,\n\n498\n00:26:37.685 --> 00:26:41.050\nis making sure that it knows\nexactly what's happening.\n\n499\n00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:42.350\nFrom that point, I'm gonna click Next.\n\n500\n00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:48.530\nAnd now we'll see we may still end up\nhaving to take this little break here\n\n501\n00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:51.900\nas it finishes up the installation\nspace of what we need.\n\n502\n00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:54.057\nThere it goes.\n\n503\n00:26:54.057 --> 00:26:57.580\nLet's see how fast it goes here for\na moment.\n\n504\n00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.046\nNow, if we still need to,\nwe'll wait this out and\n\n505\n00:27:00.046 --> 00:27:02.230\nwe'll see if we get\na little bar come across.\n\n506\n00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:05.500\nIf not, we'll kind of take our break and\nthen bring it back.\n\n507\n00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:07.380\nThere it goes, very quick.\n\n508\n00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.730\nMuch faster than what I thought\nit was gonna be at this point.\n\n509\n00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:15.220\nNotice that we have both\nthe database engine and the browser.\n\n510\n00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.190\nI just now have to go ahead and\ncontinue to click Next.\n\n511\n00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:22.540\nI'm not gonna change anything in\nthis screen because the default\n\n512\n00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:26.750\nmode here is the Windows Authentication,\nthat is what we're gonna need.\n\n513\n00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:30.860\nWe're gonna allow the remote\nconnection brokers, which is\n\n514\n00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:35.380\nthe machine that we're really kind of\nconfiguring for HA here to go ahead and\n\n515\n00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:39.240\nalso be part of being able\nto create a database.\n\n516\n00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.068\nAnd we'll see that at the end\nwhen everything is configured.\n\n517\n00:27:42.068 --> 00:27:46.680\nI'm not gonna worry about error reporting,\nthen sending it to Microsoft, and\n\n518\n00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.350\nnow, the installation process, okay.\n\n519\n00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:53.580\nSo it might be right here that we'll\nkind of have to wait it out and\n\n520\n00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.300\ndo what we need to, okay.\n\n521\n00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.340\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n522\n00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:00.850\nWe'll use the magic of our time-outs here\nto help us to condense a little bit of\n\n523\n00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:04.210\ntime and then we'll see the finish\nof the SQL Server installation.\n\n524\n00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:07.330\nAll right, so there it is.\n\n525\n00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:11.804\nIt just finished up here and, of course,\nI went so fast that I went ahead and\n\n526\n00:28:11.804 --> 00:28:16.470\nclicked Finish, so all that we're seeing\nis the result of the the installation,\n\n527\n00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:17.990\nwhich you don't actually see anymore.\n\n528\n00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.822\n&gt;&gt; Are you sure about that Ronnie?\n\n529\n00:28:18.822 --> 00:28:23.700\n&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure that it did finish up,\nso everything is now done.\n\n530\n00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.795\nAnd let's go ahead and\nfinish up this configuration,\n\n531\n00:28:26.795 --> 00:28:29.833\nlast few minutes that we\nhave left in our show, okay.\n\n532\n00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:30.450\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n533\n00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:34.770\n&gt;&gt; Now, before we go and do the other\nclient install, which it's really fairly\n\n534\n00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:39.010\nseamless, it doesn't take any time at all\non the other two very small installations.\n\n535\n00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:43.600\nThere are a couple of things that we need\nto get set up for on this SQL Server now.\n\n536\n00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:47.770\nTo get it ready for the Remote Desktop\nServices, let's take a look at my screen.\n\n537\n00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:49.790\nI went ahead and\nclicked on the Start button, and\n\n538\n00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.800\nonce we're on the Start button,\nI'm gonna come down here to the bottom,\n\n539\n00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.110\nwhere seven new apps have been installed.\n\n540\n00:28:55.110 --> 00:29:00.080\nScroll over to the right, underneath\nSQL Server 2012, that's the key.\n\n541\n00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:00.800\nSQL Server 2012.\n\n542\n00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.020\nI need to look for\n\n543\n00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.970\nthe SQL Server Configuration Manager,\nit is the one that I need.\n\n544\n00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.810\nAnd in a moment it should launch up.\n\n545\n00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:13.360\nAnd what we're gonna take a look at are\nreally two options that we need to make\n\n546\n00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.770\nsure that are properly configured for\nworking with what we need here, okay.\n\n547\n00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:21.190\nMake sure you notice these numbers,\ncuz that's gonna be key as well.\n\n548\n00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:24.574\nNotice is says native client 11.0,\nand you're gonna say,\n\n549\n00:29:24.574 --> 00:29:26.080\nwhy do I need to know that?\n\n550\n00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.050\nJust write it down,\n\n551\n00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:30.670\nI guarantee you'll understand it once we\nsee what we're gonna be connecting to.\n\n552\n00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:31.480\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n553\n00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.590\nI'm gonna expand that out,\nselect Client Protocols.\n\n554\n00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.920\nI just want to verify that TCP/IP,\n\n555\n00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:41.380\nthe type of network that I am on,\nis enabled, that's key.\n\n556\n00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.510\nIf it's not,\nmake sure you enable it, okay.\n\n557\n00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:48.900\nUsually it's gonna be enabled, but\nalways good to verify and check.\n\n558\n00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:53.440\nSecond thing is up here underneath\nSQL Server Network Configuration,\n\n559\n00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.880\nright above that.\n\n560\n00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.440\nSo we're not gonna worry about kind\nof these other things up here at\n\n561\n00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.720\nthe top just yet.\n\n562\n00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.612\nWe'll show you something\nelse you need to do.\n\n563\n00:30:00.612 --> 00:30:05.259\nBut then I'm gonna expand that out and\nfor Protocols, for MS SQL Server, or\n\n564\n00:30:05.259 --> 00:30:09.340\nMS SQL Server, whatever you wanna call it,\nthat's fine with me.\n\n565\n00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:15.970\nNow notice that there's an issue if I\ntry to connect in across an IP network.\n\n566\n00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:22.602\nNotice this, SQL Server says no, yeah,\nI don't accept connections from TCPIP,\n\n567\n00:30:22.602 --> 00:30:27.167\nwhich means I must right-click and\nenable that as well.\n\n568\n00:30:27.167 --> 00:30:30.908\nIt gives me a nice little warning that\nsays look, you've made changes, and\n\n569\n00:30:30.908 --> 00:30:34.472\nthat's great, but they're not gonna\ntake effect until you go ahead and\n\n570\n00:30:34.472 --> 00:30:35.710\nrestart the SQL Server.\n\n571\n00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:41.650\nSo at this point all I would do is open\nup Services, restart the SQL Server but\n\n572\n00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:45.390\nhere is a neat little option inside\nof the configuration manager.\n\n573\n00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:49.467\nInside the Configuration Manager\nnotice it says SQL Server Services.\n\n574\n00:30:49.467 --> 00:30:53.702\nSo if I select that,\nI can now select the MS SQL Server,\n\n575\n00:30:53.702 --> 00:30:56.657\ncuz that's the one it asked me about.\n\n576\n00:30:56.657 --> 00:30:59.675\nRight-click and\nI can restart that service.\n\n577\n00:30:59.675 --> 00:31:02.431\nSo I don't have to worry about\ngoing all the way to Services and\n\n578\n00:31:02.431 --> 00:31:03.840\nstarting it up again.\n\n579\n00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.440\nI just now go ahead, and\nyou see it's stopping the service,\n\n580\n00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.710\nnow it's starting the service again.\n\n581\n00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:11.500\nSo now those changes that I\nmade are now in effect and\n\n582\n00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.215\nworking along with\neverything that we need.\n\n583\n00:31:14.215 --> 00:31:17.445\nThere's another step that we need to\ndo here on this SQL Server, though.\n\n584\n00:31:17.445 --> 00:31:20.100\nAnd you'll probably have to do this,\neven on a real SQL Server.\n\n585\n00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.153\nMost of the time,\nthat stuff should be checked already, so\n\n586\n00:31:22.153 --> 00:31:23.517\nyou shouldn't have to worry about it.\n\n587\n00:31:23.517 --> 00:31:26.532\nBut if you're doing this specifically for\nRemote Desktop Services,\n\n588\n00:31:26.532 --> 00:31:28.290\nmake sure you do those.\n\n589\n00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:30.010\nHere is the second step.\n\n590\n00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:32.170\nWe're gonna go back to our apps.\n\n591\n00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:37.050\nScroll on over and this time I'm\nlooking for the Management Studio.\n\n592\n00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:43.204\nSo here inside the SQL Server\nManagement Studio, I now need to take\n\n593\n00:31:43.204 --> 00:31:48.687\nthe connection brokers and make them\npart of, well, a group here that I need.\n\n594\n00:31:48.687 --> 00:31:51.953\nSo first thing I'm gonna do\nis connect into the database,\n\n595\n00:31:51.953 --> 00:31:56.367\nthat will give me access of course to\nthe SQL Server that's running on DC01.\n\n596\n00:31:56.367 --> 00:32:00.581\nAnd I need to change the security.\n\n597\n00:32:00.581 --> 00:32:02.210\nNow, what do I mean by that?\n\n598\n00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:05.470\nWell, because it's gonna be the remote\ndesktop connection brokers,\n\n599\n00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:10.560\nright, that are going to need to create\na log in and sign in to the SQL server so\n\n600\n00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.700\nit can connect and create the database it\nneeds to, I need to create a new login.\n\n601\n00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:18.150\nSo I'm gonna rightclick on Logins,\nselect New Login.\n\n602\n00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:23.010\nAnd this is where it's really\nup to you on whether or\n\n603\n00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:24.920\nnot you choose to do it this way.\n\n604\n00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.520\nInside of Active Directory Users and\n\n605\n00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:30.360\nComputers I made a group\ncalled RDS Connection Brokers.\n\n606\n00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.700\nWhy?\nBecause it was simple and\n\n607\n00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.560\nI could remember, okay.\n\n608\n00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.880\nThe other thing that I did\nis I added in both RD01 and\n\n609\n00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.630\nRD02 into that Connection Brokers group.\n\n610\n00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:44.120\nCuz I know that both of them are gonna\nneed to access this SQL Server\n\n611\n00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.650\nwhen they connect.\n\n612\n00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:47.043\nSo I'm gonna click on the Search.\n\n613\n00:32:49.357 --> 00:32:52.520\nAnd then, here's where it gets tricky.\n\n614\n00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.500\nNotice it says User or\nbuilt-in security principals.\n\n615\n00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:00.340\nWell, this is something that I created,\nso it's not actually for users here.\n\n616\n00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:04.954\nI'm gonna click that and then select\nGroups because I created that RDS group.\n\n617\n00:33:04.954 --> 00:33:13.311\nNow I can type in RDS Connection Brokers,\nHere and\n\n618\n00:33:13.311 --> 00:33:17.270\nthen select Check Names, verify that\nit underlines which means it found it.\n\n619\n00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.653\nAnd now,\nwe've added in the Connection Brokers\n\n620\n00:33:22.653 --> 00:33:25.675\ngroup being able to log\ninto that SQL server.\n\n621\n00:33:25.675 --> 00:33:29.006\nWell, what I needed to do when\nI log into the SQL server?\n\n622\n00:33:29.006 --> 00:33:34.325\nThis is where I need to select the Server\nRoles and the first thing it has is,\n\n623\n00:33:34.325 --> 00:33:40.400\nhey I can access it pubicly that's fine,\nbut I need the DBCreator role as well.\n\n624\n00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.810\nMake sure you mark that.\n\n625\n00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:45.320\nYou don't do that, you can have that SQL\nServer connection broker running all day\n\n626\n00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.350\nlong, it's not gonna matter, okay.\n\n627\n00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:51.570\nSo that is something else\nthat needs to be done there.\n\n628\n00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:54.540\nNow there are a couple of other\nthings that we'll run into.\n\n629\n00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:58.010\nEspecially if you don't get it set up but\nwe'll take care of that\n\n630\n00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:01.660\nwhen we set up the second connection\nbroker to get connected in.\n\n631\n00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.290\nWe'll have to come back in here to\nMappings and we'll have to change\n\n632\n00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:07.382\na couple of items too, but we'll worry\nabout that a little bit later on.\n\n633\n00:34:08.545 --> 00:34:10.985\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Ronnie you said there were several\ndifferent things that we needed to\n\n634\n00:34:10.985 --> 00:34:11.555\ncomplete.\n\n635\n00:34:11.555 --> 00:34:14.605\nSo it looks like we're about out\nof time for this particular show.\n\n636\n00:34:14.605 --> 00:34:16.215\nHow about we just go ahead and\n\n637\n00:34:16.215 --> 00:34:21.075\npick back up with a part two to continue\nour configuration for our broker here?\n\n638\n00:34:21.075 --> 00:34:25.930\n&gt;&gt; That should actually be it for\nat least the SQL Server side, right.\n\n639\n00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:29.210\nWe still have to configure the other two\nto make sure that everything is actually\n\n640\n00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:30.060\nready and going and\n\n641\n00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.520\nof course the high availability,\nwhich we haven't gotten to yet.\n\n642\n00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.040\nSo this is a great place to stop.\n\n643\n00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:34.860\n&gt;&gt; Okay, great.\n\n644\n00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.720\nSo thank you so much for joining us today\nand thank you ladies and gentleman for\n\n645\n00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.650\nbeing here as well, but\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n646\n00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:41.540\nsign off for this particular show.\n\n647\n00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:42.920\nRemember, I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n648\n00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:43.640\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n649\n00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:47.350\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IT Pro TV.\n\n650\n00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:53.393\n[MUSIC]\n\n651\n00:34:53.393 --> 00:34:56.561\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTv.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.260\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.418\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.418 --> 00:00:14.670\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nRemote Desktop Services show.\n\n7\n00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.520\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n8\n00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.220\nIf you've been following along,\nyou'll know this is actually a part two.\n\n9\n00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.590\nIn the previous episode, Ronnie had just\nfinished up installing that SQL Server\n\n10\n00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.990\non our broker for a high availability.\n\n11\n00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.610\nWe're gonna go ahead and continue.\n\n12\n00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.410\nThank you so much for\njoining us today, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.620\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me\nback as we continue on the rest of\n\n14\n00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.220\nthe installation here for\na high availability.\n\n15\n00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.430\nAnd you're right, we'd just finished\nthe installation of SQL Server.\n\n16\n00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.330\nWe showed you where you could go in and\nwhere you have to go in and configure it\n\n17\n00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.258\nso that now our remote desktop\nconnection brokers, right, can connect\n\n18\n00:00:47.258 --> 00:00:51.820\ninto that SQL Server and, of course, be\nable to create databases as they need to.\n\n19\n00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.550\nNow, there's still a problem that we have\nto worry about and deal with, and that,\n\n20\n00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.050\nof course,\nis the Windows Firewall, itself.\n\n21\n00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.850\nEven though it allows for\nconnections be open and for\n\n22\n00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.410\nus to do this, but it really doesn't allow\nfor connections to come in too easily.\n\n23\n00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.620\nSo that SQL Server right now\nis essentially protected.\n\n24\n00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.210\nEven if we set up everything else that\nwe need to, that means we still need to\n\n25\n00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.630\nactually open up something in\nthe firewall to help us out.\n\n26\n00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.210\nSo let's go ahead and configure that, and\n\n27\n00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.090\nthen we'll move on through the next\npart of the configuration that we need.\n\n28\n00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.460\nSo the great thing is it's\nrelatively simple to do so.\n\n29\n00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.770\nLet's go ahead and take a look here.\n\n30\n00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:27.720\nOn my machine,\n\n31\n00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.210\nI'm gonna click on the Start button in\nthe lower left-hand corner of the screen.\n\n32\n00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.190\nAnd once we do that,\nwe are going to type in,\n\n33\n00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.370\nI'm just gonna start typing here,\nfirewall.\n\n34\n00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.350\nSelect the Windows Firewall with\nAdvanced Security is what I'm going to do.\n\n35\n00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.070\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie,\nis there a particular port or\n\n36\n00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.650\nwhat type of rule would be setting here?\n\n37\n00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.960\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nwe have two options at this point.\n\n38\n00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.388\nSo it really depends on your-\n&gt;&gt; Prerogative?\n\n39\n00:01:54.388 --> 00:01:54.961\n&gt;&gt; Preference.\n\n40\n00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:57.850\nYeah, it really does,\nIt just depends on what you like to do.\n\n41\n00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.640\nOne, we could have just used the Windows\nFirewall and made an exception for\n\n42\n00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.315\nSQL Server, if we chose to.\n\n43\n00:02:03.315 --> 00:02:03.850\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nSo just\n\n44\n00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.330\nallow that entire thing to come through.\n\n45\n00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.570\nI don't like that, but\npeople will do it, and\n\n46\n00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.300\nthat's perfectly fine and you can do that.\n\n47\n00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.630\nI like doing this where I'm going\nto set an exception just for\n\n48\n00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.550\nthe port that we need, which is port 1433.\n\n49\n00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.060\nThat's the default for\nSQL Server, instead.\n\n50\n00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.020\nNow, I like opening up just one\nport because if you go and say,\n\n51\n00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.410\nlook, here it is, the entire SQL Server\ncan, of course, get access through.\n\n52\n00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.790\nAnd it does it for TCP as well as UDP.\n\n53\n00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.856\nIt gives you every access in.\n\n54\n00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:39.010\nIt's saying SQL Server's open,\nso anytime somebody can\n\n55\n00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.690\nfigure out a vulnerability to exploit,\nwell, that means they'll be able to do so.\n\n56\n00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.240\nI like opening up only\nthe specific ports I need to.\n\n57\n00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.710\nIt doesn't mean that you\nhave to do it that way.\n\n58\n00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.290\nIt doesn't mean that I'm right.\n\n59\n00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.130\nYou may go, there's no harm in that.\n\n60\n00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.422\nPerfectly fine.\n\n61\n00:02:51.422 --> 00:02:53.396\nI have my particular preference,\n\n62\n00:02:53.396 --> 00:02:56.808\nwhich is only open up the minuscule\namount that you need to.\n\n63\n00:02:56.808 --> 00:02:58.130\nAnd that's what we're going to do.\n\n64\n00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.680\nI'm gonna select an inbound rule and\nthen click on New Rule.\n\n65\n00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.050\nWhen I do so,\nI'm gonna select the port number for\n\n66\n00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.600\nwhat we need, click Next and\nthen just do it for TCP here.\n\n67\n00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.770\nThis is port 14.\n\n68\n00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.160\n&gt;&gt; 33?\n33.\n\n69\n00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.789\nClick Next.\n\n70\n00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:17.870\nWe're gonna allow for\nthat connection to happen.\n\n71\n00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.350\nClick Next, I'm gonna do it for\nall the connections.\n\n72\n00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.130\nWe're not gonna be connecting\nin too much on public too often.\n\n73\n00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.920\nBut I'll just call this one SQL Server,\nnice and easy for us to do.\n\n74\n00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.450\nClick Finish, and\nnow the connection's in for\n\n75\n00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.549\nthose remote desktop connection brokers.\n\n76\n00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.162\nOnce we install the client, they should\nbe able to connect and reach over and\n\n77\n00:03:41.162 --> 00:03:42.300\ndo what they need to do.\n\n78\n00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.130\nAll right, so\nthat kind of another piece in the puzzle.\n\n79\n00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.010\nThe installation of the SQL Server,\nitself, making sure,\n\n80\n00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.870\nof course,\nthe roles are installed that we need to.\n\n81\n00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.510\nDoing simple things like this, right.\n\n82\n00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.110\nAny of these can be failing in your\ncomponent when trying to set everything up\n\n83\n00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.580\nthe way that we want.\n\n84\n00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.810\nNow, other things also have\nto kind of occur as well.\n\n85\n00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.820\nWhen we set up the single server\ndeployment, right, we created\n\n86\n00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.130\na certificate for rd1 because that was\nthe only server we were going to use.\n\n87\n00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.691\nSo I simply used the name of that server.\n\n88\n00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:18.138\nBut now that we're setting up for\nhigh availability, in other words,\n\n89\n00:04:18.138 --> 00:04:21.240\nI know I'm going to be using more\nthan one server to connect in and\n\n90\n00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.685\ndo everything that I need to.\n\n91\n00:04:22.685 --> 00:04:25.930\nWell, which one do I want\npeople connecting to?\n\n92\n00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.812\nIf I get just a certificate for rd1, well,\nthat's always gonna send everybody where?\n\n93\n00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:31.632\nTo rd1.\n\n94\n00:04:31.632 --> 00:04:37.270\nIf I get one just for rd2, that's always\ngonna send and collect there for rd2.\n\n95\n00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.430\nSo we need to, of course,\nthen change that up.\n\n96\n00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.000\nBut before we do that, we also want\nto create, of course, a DNS entry.\n\n97\n00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.230\nAnd this is a specific type of DNS entry\nthat we call a round robin DNS entry,\n\n98\n00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.410\ninstead.\n\n99\n00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.920\nSo that is the next thing\nwe are going to set up.\n\n100\n00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.934\nOn my server manager, over on\nthe left-hand side, I'm gonna choose DNS.\n\n101\n00:04:58.934 --> 00:05:05.240\nI'm gonna right-click on the DC01 and\nselect My DNS Manager.\n\n102\n00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.177\nAnd it's inside of the DNS manager\nthat I need to configure this.\n\n103\n00:05:10.177 --> 00:05:10.690\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n104\n00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.882\nRonnie, so just to clarify that term\nthat you said about round robining.\n\n105\n00:05:13.882 --> 00:05:15.750\n&gt;&gt; Hm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So what we're doing is we're gonna be\n\n106\n00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.152\nhaving two different machines, and they're\npointing to one particular name here.\n\n107\n00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:23.133\nSo it looks like from the outside we're\njust connecting to one machine when,\n\n108\n00:05:23.133 --> 00:05:26.730\nin fact, we actually have two physical,\nor virtual, machines.\n\n109\n00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.840\n&gt;&gt; Correct, and\nthat's what the whole goal is, right.\n\n110\n00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.272\nFor high availability we don't really care\nthat somebody wants to connect rd01 or\n\n111\n00:05:34.272 --> 00:05:35.030\nrd02.\n\n112\n00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.887\nWe just want them to connect.\n\n113\n00:05:35.887 --> 00:05:40.000\nSo we're gonna set up another name and\nareas, if you want to, to do this.\n\n114\n00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.063\nNow, the that we do this is that we\ndon't actually set up just records,\n\n115\n00:05:44.063 --> 00:05:45.847\nwe just set up a brand new zone.\n\n116\n00:05:45.847 --> 00:05:49.567\nI'm gonna right-click,\nselect New Zone, click Next.\n\n117\n00:05:49.567 --> 00:05:53.400\nIt's gonna be a primary zone,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n118\n00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.615\nI want it on all my DNS servers right now,\nit's only one, so no real big deal there.\n\n119\n00:05:57.615 --> 00:06:02.930\nIt's here, that I want to set up\nhow I want people to connect in.\n\n120\n00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.637\nSo I'm simply gonna just call\nit rds to make it easy for me,\n\n121\n00:06:06.637 --> 00:06:09.110\nmore then everybody else here.\n\n122\n00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.169\nJust call it rds.\n\n123\n00:06:11.505 --> 00:06:13.110\nOkay, now you can call\nit whatever you want to.\n\n124\n00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.460\nYou can call it Gateway,\n\n125\n00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.530\nyou can call it whatever that you\nwant people to connect in as.\n\n126\n00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.972\nBut I'm just gonna use rds, click Next.\n\n127\n00:06:21.972 --> 00:06:26.000\nAnd now we're gonna allow for\nupdates, perfectly fine.\n\n128\n00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.429\nClick Finish.\n\n129\n00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:31.651\nThis is where we have to create\na couple of records, right.\n\n130\n00:06:31.651 --> 00:06:36.036\nI'm gonna expand out that new\nzone by going inside of it and\n\n131\n00:06:36.036 --> 00:06:37.950\ncreating a new A record.\n\n132\n00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.370\nNow, if I create a new A record and\nI add in a name here,\n\n133\n00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.940\nI want you to notice this second line.\n\n134\n00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.992\nSo let's say I go, I need one for rd01.\n\n135\n00:06:45.992 --> 00:06:50.198\nWell, I really don't want\nit connecting to rd01, so\n\n136\n00:06:50.198 --> 00:06:53.696\ninstead I'm just gonna\nleave that one blank.\n\n137\n00:06:53.696 --> 00:06:55.689\nWell, let me see if I can get out of that.\n\n138\n00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:56.532\nThere we go.\n\n139\n00:06:56.532 --> 00:07:02.138\nAnd then 10.0.46 201.\n\n140\n00:07:02.138 --> 00:07:06.556\nNow, notice the fully\nqualified domain name part.\n\n141\n00:07:06.556 --> 00:07:08.410\nStill available, and I can click Add Host.\n\n142\n00:07:11.417 --> 00:07:16.530\nAnd there we go, I have now\ncreated a new host for that zone.\n\n143\n00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.910\nAnd do the same thing here for,\nwell, my other one,\n\n144\n00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:27.010\nwhich is gonna be 10.0.46.202,\nif I remember the IP addresses okay.\n\n145\n00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.520\n&gt;&gt; That is correct.\n\n146\n00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.560\nClick Add Host, and click OK.\n\n147\n00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.370\nSo both of those should be able to respond\n\n148\n00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.762\nto anybody that's connecting\nin by rds.ITProTVDemo.com.\n\n149\n00:07:38.762 --> 00:07:39.582\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\n\n150\n00:07:39.582 --> 00:07:43.920\nso that's the zones that are actually\nset up for us to be able to do this.\n\n151\n00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.846\nNow, once we've got that,\nwe've pretty much got just about\n\n152\n00:07:48.846 --> 00:07:52.654\neverything that we need, except for\njust a couple of options now.\n\n153\n00:07:52.654 --> 00:07:57.091\nNow, one of the other things that I've\nbeen talking about is that there is a SQL\n\n154\n00:07:57.091 --> 00:07:59.459\nclient connection that needs to be done.\n\n155\n00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:05.153\nSo, I need to go over to the RD01 and\nlet's add that client connection in now.\n\n156\n00:08:07.797 --> 00:08:10.436\nRemember to log on as the administrator.\n\n157\n00:08:16.325 --> 00:08:21.605\nAnd once I do so,\nwe're going to run just a simple MSI file.\n\n158\n00:08:21.605 --> 00:08:25.701\nNow, we'll add in the single client and\nwe won't even worry about it again.\n\n159\n00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:28.796\nWe won't have to configure it or anything\nelse, but it does need to be run now.\n\n160\n00:08:31.184 --> 00:08:35.193\nSo inside of my shared folder,\nI need to look and\n\n161\n00:08:35.193 --> 00:08:39.003\nit is the kind of\nthe miniscule one that says,\n\n162\n00:08:39.003 --> 00:08:43.040\nsqln native client is\nwhat we're looking for.\n\n163\n00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:43.607\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n164\n00:08:43.607 --> 00:08:47.500\n&gt;&gt; That's why it does that and you can\ndownload this right from Microsoft.\n\n165\n00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.796\nSelect install and\n\n166\n00:08:48.796 --> 00:08:53.339\nwe'll see it will kind of run\nan installation file here for us too.\n\n167\n00:08:57.663 --> 00:08:59.968\nSelect Run.\n\n168\n00:08:59.968 --> 00:09:03.853\nNow if it's missing any prerequisites,\nit'll show up during the install.\n\n169\n00:09:03.853 --> 00:09:05.239\nThat's what we'll end up seeing.\n\n170\n00:09:05.239 --> 00:09:06.898\nYou can also see there's\nthat note first thing, hey,\n\n171\n00:09:06.898 --> 00:09:09.149\nRonnie, you haven't licensed anything yet,\ncuz we haven't set it up.\n\n172\n00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:11.520\nClick Next.\n\n173\n00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.770\nAccept the terms.\n\n174\n00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:20.185\nWe don't need the actual SDK for\nthe software development kit,\n\n175\n00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:22.533\nwe just need the client components.\n\n176\n00:09:22.533 --> 00:09:24.766\nClick Install and let it do its thing.\n\n177\n00:09:27.252 --> 00:09:31.047\nNow just because I'm trying\nto save a little bit of time,\n\n178\n00:09:31.047 --> 00:09:36.106\nI'm gonna come over here to the second\none even though I haven't set it up yet\n\n179\n00:09:36.106 --> 00:09:40.137\nand I'm simply gonna add this role in or\nthat client in here,\n\n180\n00:09:40.137 --> 00:09:43.962\ncuz I know we're gonna be using this for\nconfiguration.\n\n181\n00:09:43.962 --> 00:09:49.085\nSo it's here, administrator and\nwe're doing essentially the same\n\n182\n00:09:49.085 --> 00:09:53.776\nexact thing on the other server\nthat we're gonna end up using.\n\n183\n00:09:53.776 --> 00:09:58.354\nNow on this, there is no roles comes,\nactually installed at all, but\n\n184\n00:09:58.354 --> 00:10:00.771\nis only trying to connect to the SQL.\n\n185\n00:10:00.771 --> 00:10:03.068\nSo, I'm not so worried about it.\n\n186\n00:10:03.068 --> 00:10:06.745\nLet me go and\njust get this process started here.\n\n187\n00:10:06.745 --> 00:10:08.348\nSo that way,\nwe won't have to run through it again\n\n188\n00:10:14.678 --> 00:10:19.213\nSo that's finished up on RD01 and\nnow the second process should go ahead and\n\n189\n00:10:19.213 --> 00:10:20.272\nstart, as well.\n\n190\n00:10:24.284 --> 00:10:27.931\nAnd we'll let it finish its preparations\nand doing everything that it needs to.\n\n191\n00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:31.587\nNow, we can go back to configuring for\nhigh availability.\n\n192\n00:10:31.587 --> 00:10:35.881\nSo, this is where it gets\nlittle bit more unusual.\n\n193\n00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:40.038\nSo now that we've got all of\nthe basic components setup,\n\n194\n00:10:40.038 --> 00:10:44.377\nwe can now begin the configuration for\nhigh availability.\n\n195\n00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:47.065\nIf I select remote desktop services,\n\n196\n00:10:47.065 --> 00:10:51.187\nI wanna verify that both of my\nservers are going to be here.\n\n197\n00:10:51.187 --> 00:10:55.311\nNow I don't have the other server for\nright now which is fine,\n\n198\n00:10:55.311 --> 00:10:58.722\nyou only see where it's\nactually RD01 here, but\n\n199\n00:10:58.722 --> 00:11:02.065\nI haven't installed that other roll yet\neither.\n\n200\n00:11:02.065 --> 00:11:06.448\nThis is where we installed\nin the other two rolls here.\n\n201\n00:11:06.448 --> 00:11:12.500\nSo if I add in that licensing server now,\nI'm gonna put that on DCO1,\n\n202\n00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.306\njust like I did previously\nin another show.\n\n203\n00:11:16.306 --> 00:11:18.977\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie,\nyou spoke about the sequencing earlier.\n\n204\n00:11:18.977 --> 00:11:20.826\nIs this something that we\nwanna pay attention to for\n\n205\n00:11:20.826 --> 00:11:22.034\nthis particular step, as well?\n\n206\n00:11:22.034 --> 00:11:25.335\n&gt;&gt; Not really, we could have\ninstalled them all at one time, but\n\n207\n00:11:25.335 --> 00:11:29.098\nI was trying to keep a little bit of\ncontinuity, so that they could go.\n\n208\n00:11:29.098 --> 00:11:33.414\nInstead of you saying like,\nwhy did he choose to wait until then and\n\n209\n00:11:33.414 --> 00:11:36.279\nthen why is he doing\nthis early in this show?\n\n210\n00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:38.296\nI was like let me keep\nthe same continuity here, so\n\n211\n00:11:38.296 --> 00:11:40.421\nyou can install them all at\none time if you wanted to.\n\n212\n00:11:40.421 --> 00:11:41.567\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n213\n00:11:41.567 --> 00:11:44.235\n&gt;&gt; But for the sake of the way\nthat we did this show earlier, so\n\n214\n00:11:44.235 --> 00:11:47.463\nthat we could do a separate show on\nlicensing, that's why I did that.\n\n215\n00:11:47.463 --> 00:11:51.433\nSo I just kind of I'm trying to keep\na little bit of continuity instead of you\n\n216\n00:11:51.433 --> 00:11:54.343\nripping out your hair like no,\nI gotta wait to do this.\n\n217\n00:11:54.343 --> 00:11:56.710\nUntil I say, no, you can do that\nall at one time if you want to.\n\n218\n00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.719\nNow, let me select this one.\n\n219\n00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:05.442\nOn the gateway, I'm also going\nto add that into RD01 as well.\n\n220\n00:12:08.032 --> 00:12:09.753\nSo, we're simply just adding in the roles.\n\n221\n00:12:09.753 --> 00:12:13.140\nNow, this is something we do\nneed to pay attention to here.\n\n222\n00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.156\nIt's asking me for\na self-signed certificate and\n\n223\n00:12:18.156 --> 00:12:20.505\nthat's key for the idea of HA.\n\n224\n00:12:20.505 --> 00:12:23.782\nBefore when we did this,\nI just chose what RD01.\n\n225\n00:12:23.782 --> 00:12:27.956\nWell, now I want to actually\ncreate a certificate for\n\n226\n00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:33.728\nRDS instead ITProTVDemo, that's\nthe name of that zone that we created.\n\n227\n00:12:33.728 --> 00:12:35.120\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That's what we want.\n\n228\n00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.640\nClick Next here and then click Add.\n\n229\n00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.700\nSo now, I'm actually creating\na pretty much just instead\n\n230\n00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:49.664\nthat here's a cell sign certificate that's\ngonna read RDS is what's gonna read.\n\n231\n00:12:49.664 --> 00:12:51.736\n&gt;&gt; Any one of those machines\nif they're responding,\n\n232\n00:12:51.736 --> 00:12:55.470\nthat's how it will be represented, so\nit doesn't matter who's responding.\n\n233\n00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:56.580\n&gt;&gt; Now the problem that we have,\nof course,\n\n234\n00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.940\nwith a self-signed certificate is simple.\n\n235\n00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.393\nIt's not gonna be recognized by anybody,\nso\n\n236\n00:13:01.393 --> 00:13:03.979\nwe'll still need to do\na certificate request.\n\n237\n00:13:03.979 --> 00:13:07.151\nBut at least at this point it's saying,\ngo ahead and make one of these and\n\n238\n00:13:07.151 --> 00:13:08.569\nwe're gonna replace it later.\n\n239\n00:13:08.569 --> 00:13:10.638\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But let's go ahead and\n\n240\n00:13:10.638 --> 00:13:15.466\nfollow this step through as\nthe remote gateway is added in here.\n\n241\n00:13:15.466 --> 00:13:17.480\nNow once we get everything settled up,\n\n242\n00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.506\nwe need to add in those servers into this\nmachine, so that we can manage them and\n\n243\n00:13:21.506 --> 00:13:25.227\nthen we'll get started in on that HA\neven though we're gonna actually at\n\n244\n00:13:25.227 --> 00:13:28.851\nthe beginning here credit and\nunusual thing which is a cluster of one.\n\n245\n00:13:28.851 --> 00:13:32.134\nBut it will actually work and\ndo everything we need and then\n\n246\n00:13:32.134 --> 00:13:36.695\nwe add on a second one for another show,\nperhaps that's what one that seeing it.\n\n247\n00:13:36.695 --> 00:13:37.712\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n248\n00:13:37.712 --> 00:13:38.478\n&gt;&gt; So, here it is.\n\n249\n00:13:38.478 --> 00:13:40.614\nIt's just been finished or let me see.\n\n250\n00:13:45.973 --> 00:13:47.137\nWell, that's weird.\n\n251\n00:13:47.137 --> 00:13:50.548\nI'm trying to see what I've,\nwell, it's just screen artifact.\n\n252\n00:13:50.548 --> 00:13:52.813\nIt kinda gets leftover.\n\n253\n00:13:52.813 --> 00:13:55.436\nSo now it says,\neverything's been configured.\n\n254\n00:13:55.436 --> 00:13:56.647\nThat's cool.\n\n255\n00:13:56.647 --> 00:13:58.075\nThat's what we want.\n\n256\n00:13:58.075 --> 00:14:02.265\nNow at this point,\nonce we've got just about everything done,\n\n257\n00:14:02.265 --> 00:14:06.237\nI need to go to Tasks and\nselect Edit Deployment Properties.\n\n258\n00:14:11.885 --> 00:14:13.764\nI'll add two.\n\n259\n00:14:13.764 --> 00:14:17.686\nNow we're again, just taking\na look at some of the stuff here.\n\n260\n00:14:17.686 --> 00:14:19.923\nThese are things that we\nalready went through, so\n\n261\n00:14:19.923 --> 00:14:23.402\nI'm not gonna go through them all again,\nbut I need to create a certificate.\n\n262\n00:14:23.402 --> 00:14:28.620\nThat's gonna come from my certificate\nauthority instead of that self-signed one.\n\n263\n00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.138\nSo, I still need to do that.\n\n264\n00:14:30.138 --> 00:14:34.683\nBut before we get to that point, let's\ndo this idea of high availability and\n\n265\n00:14:34.683 --> 00:14:35.710\nget this setup.\n\n266\n00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.410\nWe may have to stop and\ndo the certificates anyways, but\n\n267\n00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.320\nthe easiest thing is simple.\n\n268\n00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:44.081\nRD connection broker underneath\nthe deployment overview,\n\n269\n00:14:44.081 --> 00:14:47.332\nwe're gonna select configure\nhigh availability.\n\n270\n00:14:47.332 --> 00:14:52.656\nAnd once I do this, if you hadn't\nconnected not connected, if you have\n\n271\n00:14:52.656 --> 00:14:58.804\nnot installed a SQL Server, notice what\nit says right here at the very beginning.\n\n272\n00:14:58.804 --> 00:15:01.393\nSo, it gives you a list of prerequisites.\n\n273\n00:15:01.393 --> 00:15:02.910\nYou need a SQL Server\nwith write permissions.\n\n274\n00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:04.708\n&gt;&gt; At least with write permissions.\n\n275\n00:15:04.708 --> 00:15:06.909\n&gt;&gt; With write permissions\nat the very least.\n\n276\n00:15:06.909 --> 00:15:09.379\nGood thing is, we actually did\na little bit more than that.\n\n277\n00:15:09.379 --> 00:15:13.212\nWe need the Microsoft SQL Server installed\non all connection connection brokers.\n\n278\n00:15:13.212 --> 00:15:14.477\nWe're kind of in\nthe process on doing that.\n\n279\n00:15:14.477 --> 00:15:15.196\n&gt;&gt; We're getting there.\n\n280\n00:15:15.196 --> 00:15:16.073\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n281\n00:15:16.073 --> 00:15:18.061\n&gt;&gt; And we need static IP addresses\n\n282\n00:15:18.061 --> 00:15:19.286\nassigned to this.\n\n283\n00:15:19.286 --> 00:15:22.508\nWe raided on that too and DNS records.\n\n284\n00:15:22.508 --> 00:15:23.326\nLook at that with the single name.\n\n285\n00:15:23.326 --> 00:15:24.550\n&gt;&gt; Good job, you done that too.\n\n286\n00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.822\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, look at that.\n\n287\n00:15:25.822 --> 00:15:28.545\nSo, we could have started\nright here is what I'm saying.\n\n288\n00:15:28.545 --> 00:15:30.999\nYou're probably saying like,\nwhy did you do all that at the beginning?\n\n289\n00:15:30.999 --> 00:15:35.814\nBecause I didn't want to wait until now\nand go yeah, before we actually start the-\n\n290\n00:15:35.814 --> 00:15:39.290\n&gt;&gt; You didn't want to scare us, I get it.\n\n291\n00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.535\n&gt;&gt; Then this is what you do.\n\n292\n00:15:40.535 --> 00:15:43.731\nSo, the great thing is you already saw\nthat in a previous episode that we've just\n\n293\n00:15:43.731 --> 00:15:44.960\nabout installed everything.\n\n294\n00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.778\nNow the only thing that\nis not mentioning here,\n\n295\n00:15:47.778 --> 00:15:50.109\nwhich is strange is the firewall role.\n\n296\n00:15:50.109 --> 00:15:53.213\nSo it didn't say, open up for,\nallow for the connect.\n\n297\n00:15:53.213 --> 00:15:58.165\nMake sure you have firewall rules that\nallow you to connect to the SQL Server.\n\n298\n00:15:58.165 --> 00:16:01.680\nSo that's kinda the only missing\nelement that they didn't install here,\n\n299\n00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.297\nthat they didn't put right here,\n\n300\n00:16:03.297 --> 00:16:07.120\nwhich would've been a nice reminder at\nsome point because I know something.\n\n301\n00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.013\nThat's what kept me from getting in\nthe first time where I was like,\n\n302\n00:16:11.013 --> 00:16:12.462\n[SOUND] what am I missing?\n\n303\n00:16:12.462 --> 00:16:15.850\nI went through all these rules, and\nI was like, I don't know what I'm missing.\n\n304\n00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.810\nAnd finally I had to look it up and\ngo, look at that.\n\n305\n00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:18.690\nThere it is.\n\n306\n00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.020\nWe need a firewall rule.\n\n307\n00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for sharing.\n\n308\n00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:22.444\nNow they know.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n309\n00:16:22.444 --> 00:16:26.380\nhere's where it gets a little\nbit more unusual, okay?\n\n310\n00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:30.800\nNow for me, I am a terrible\ntypist when it comes down to it.\n\n311\n00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.469\nBut you'll notice that it's asking for\n\n312\n00:16:32.469 --> 00:16:35.598\nthree things if we are gonna\nconfigure high availability.\n\n313\n00:16:35.598 --> 00:16:38.360\nAnd there are still a couple of things\nI can get wrong, whether I copy and\n\n314\n00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.260\npaste it or not.\n\n315\n00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.850\nBut the great thing is it really\nkinda resolves back down to\n\n316\n00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:46.480\nwhere we configured it\ninside the SQL Server.\n\n317\n00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:53.250\nEither on the remote desktop connection\nbroker, on the RD connection broker,\n\n318\n00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:57.960\nit can't see the SQL Server, or\nI pointed it to the wrong SQL Server.\n\n319\n00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.300\nAnd that can happen.\n\n320\n00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.500\nSo the good thing is,\nI'm just gonna copy and paste.\n\n321\n00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:06.100\nThe first thing that it wants is what it\ncalls the Database connection string.\n\n322\n00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:11.190\nNow, if we look over here,\nlet me see if I can show you, over here.\n\n323\n00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:15.130\nLet me do it in the white, that'll make\nit a little bit easier, I say that.\n\n324\n00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.990\nSo this first line is\nwhat it's looking for.\n\n325\n00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:20.440\nIt's saying, what are you using here?\n\n326\n00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.487\nThe SQL server client 11.0.\n\n327\n00:17:21.487 --> 00:17:24.107\nRemember I told you to write that down?\n\n328\n00:17:24.107 --> 00:17:24.809\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n329\n00:17:24.809 --> 00:17:28.400\n&gt;&gt; Cuz if not, you'll go, I don't know,\nI'm running what, SQL Server 2012?\n\n330\n00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.922\nAnd you'll go, let me change that to what?\n\n331\n00:17:30.922 --> 00:17:31.581\nA 12.\n\n332\n00:17:31.581 --> 00:17:33.780\nYou'll go, I'm connecting into where?\n\n333\n00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.850\nWell, make sure you have\nyour name of your server.\n\n334\n00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.970\nSay, hey,\nare we gonna use a trusted connection?\n\n335\n00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.310\nYes, app services, you name it.\n\n336\n00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:44.990\nAnd then you can name the database\nwhatever you want to.\n\n337\n00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.800\nSo this is the one that I chose.\n\n338\n00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.770\nSo I'm simply gonna,\nI think I'm gonna copy this.\n\n339\n00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:53.360\nLet me go on over here into\nmy mark down and copy it.\n\n340\n00:17:57.548 --> 00:18:02.059\nAll right, so that's the first bit,\nthen I'm gonna paste it right in here.\n\n341\n00:18:03.508 --> 00:18:07.980\nAnd then here's the second part,\nthe folder to store the database files.\n\n342\n00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:12.360\nYou can put this anywhere that you want to\nas long as you remember where you put it.\n\n343\n00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.778\nYou don't remember where you put it,\nyou're out of luck.\n\n344\n00:18:15.778 --> 00:18:22.100\nI'm just gonna use the default install\nprogram path for Microsoft SQL Server.\n\n345\n00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.060\nNow if you choose to do it this way,\n\n346\n00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.670\nverify that that is where\nyour SQL Server actually is.\n\n347\n00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:32.580\nSo that's what you're looking for\nas well, okay?\n\n348\n00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.768\nThat has to match up.\n\n349\n00:18:33.768 --> 00:18:37.246\nIf it doesn't,\nyou are going to be in trouble.\n\n350\n00:18:37.246 --> 00:18:40.850\nSo go back in to your folder, verify.\n\n351\n00:18:43.159 --> 00:18:47.060\nSQL Server, and that's what\nyou're looking for, right there.\n\n352\n00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.697\nSo you wanna use the default path\nwhere it's gonna store everything on\n\n353\n00:18:50.697 --> 00:18:52.126\nSQL Express, there it is.\n\n354\n00:18:52.126 --> 00:18:54.141\nIf that number is a 12-\n&gt;&gt; It's not gonna work.\n\n355\n00:18:54.141 --> 00:18:55.480\n&gt;&gt; Make that a 12, yeah.\n\n356\n00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.840\nSo that's [LAUGH] what I'm saying, okay?\n\n357\n00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.279\nIf that number is an 11,\nmake sure that that's actually an 11.\n\n358\n00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.090\nAnd here, of course, is the round\nrobin DNS name that I just created.\n\n359\n00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.689\nSo that's another good thing.\n\n360\n00:19:07.689 --> 00:19:12.990\nRDS.itpro.tvdemo.com.\n\n361\n00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:17.276\nI'm gonna come up with a shorter\nlab name at some point, but\n\n362\n00:19:17.276 --> 00:19:19.177\nthat's a good one for me.\n\n363\n00:19:19.177 --> 00:19:24.057\nI like it because nobody on the Internet\nhas chosen demo to be part of their\n\n364\n00:19:24.057 --> 00:19:25.770\ntrue domain name.\n\n365\n00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:27.185\nSo that's why I chose it.\n\n366\n00:19:27.185 --> 00:19:28.885\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That works.\n\n367\n00:19:28.885 --> 00:19:29.925\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n368\n00:19:29.925 --> 00:19:32.780\n&gt;&gt; You don't wanna anyone to be going to\nplaces we really don't want them to be.\n\n369\n00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.440\n&gt;&gt; That's true, yeah.\n\n370\n00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.820\nIf everything is good, okay,\nthis is what you should see next, okay?\n\n371\n00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.030\nIf everything is good up in this point,\nthat's what you should see.\n\n372\n00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.382\nNormally if it doesn't connect in,\nit tells you.\n\n373\n00:19:44.382 --> 00:19:47.552\nIt's like, go back and\ncheck the path of the database or\n\n374\n00:19:47.552 --> 00:19:51.400\ncheck your permissions on\nconnecting to that database.\n\n375\n00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.750\nUsually those are probably only two\nkind of real obstacles that you have.\n\n376\n00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.740\nEven at this point, can it still fail?\n\n377\n00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:04.660\nYes, so the only way to do to figure\nthis out of course then is configure.\n\n378\n00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.791\nAnd if it does that, it'll tell you\nsomething like connection failed.\n\n379\n00:20:07.791 --> 00:20:12.077\nAnd tell you that the database wasn't able\nto be created, which normally means that,\n\n380\n00:20:12.077 --> 00:20:15.441\nhey, you didn't actually get all\nof the proper permissions here.\n\n381\n00:20:15.441 --> 00:20:19.824\nNow you will run into an issue,\nI shouldn't say you will, Ronnie will\n\n382\n00:20:19.824 --> 00:20:24.227\nprobably run into [LAUGH] an issue\nwhen we add in that second SQL Server.\n\n383\n00:20:24.227 --> 00:20:29.980\nThat second RDS connection broker,\nwhich I can't remember what it's called,\n\n384\n00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.710\ninto the cluster here,\nwhen it tries to connect in.\n\n385\n00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:37.325\nAnd that's because there is\na strange little quirk that happens.\n\n386\n00:20:37.325 --> 00:20:38.426\nAnd we'll have to go in and\n\n387\n00:20:38.426 --> 00:20:41.410\nmodify some of those permissions\nback onto SQL Server again.\n\n388\n00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:42.516\nBut I don't wanna bring that up yet.\n\n389\n00:20:42.516 --> 00:20:46.785\nBut we'll see that one when we get to that\npoint when everything is ready to go.\n\n390\n00:20:46.785 --> 00:20:47.737\nSo there it is.\n\n391\n00:20:47.737 --> 00:20:49.880\nThat is what what we're looking for.\n\n392\n00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:50.458\n&gt;&gt; Succeeded.\n\n393\n00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:51.405\n&gt;&gt; Succeeded.\n\n394\n00:20:51.405 --> 00:20:53.960\n&gt;&gt; Good job.\n&gt;&gt; That is a pretty much\n\n395\n00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:59.320\nthe key at getting everything kind\nof done and started here, okay?\n\n396\n00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.570\nNow, I'm still missing something.\n\n397\n00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:02.770\nI told it,\nat least in that SQL Server, right,\n\n398\n00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.890\nthat this would be a trusted connection.\n\n399\n00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:09.570\nSo now I need to get a certificate\nfrom a certificate authority.\n\n400\n00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.640\nThe great thing is,\nwe've already done this before.\n\n401\n00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.180\nSo this process shouldn't be the most\nchallenging process in the world.\n\n402\n00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.700\nFor anybody else but Ronnie,\nit's gonna be a challenging process.\n\n403\n00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:22.490\nSo let's go ahead and\ndo that, is our next step.\n\n404\n00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.452\nSo on this one, I gotta remember which.\n\n405\n00:21:25.452 --> 00:21:29.880\nOkay, I always forget which server I'm on\ncuz everything looks identical, right?\n\n406\n00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.520\nI need to go over to the RD01, log in.\n\n407\n00:21:36.526 --> 00:21:38.197\nAll right, over on the DCO1,\n\n408\n00:21:38.197 --> 00:21:42.940\nI should still have the certificate\nauthority running and up and ready to go.\n\n409\n00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.750\nNow I need to create a new\ncertificate authority or a request.\n\n410\n00:21:54.624 --> 00:21:59.520\nSo I'm going to go into my IINS and\nopen up the web server.\n\n411\n00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.020\nThe IINS Services Manager.\n\n412\n00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:08.610\nAnd then, we are gonna create\na certificate authority request.\n\n413\n00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:09.110\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n414\n00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.520\n&gt;&gt; I'm not gonna worry about\nshowing that message again.\n\n415\n00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.129\nGo into these server certificates.\n\n416\n00:22:21.418 --> 00:22:26.380\nSo here's the one that we just\ncreated not too long ago right here.\n\n417\n00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.740\nAnd both of these are self-silencer\ntickets, which are not gonna work for me.\n\n418\n00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.980\nSo I'm just gonna remove these\nout of the store for right now.\n\n419\n00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:38.648\nSo even though it actually issued a self\none and then we did this same thing inside\n\n420\n00:22:38.648 --> 00:22:43.330\nof the high availability setting when we\ndid this, remove that from the store.\n\n421\n00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.760\nI'm gonna create a new\ncertificate request.\n\n422\n00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.420\nAt least, I hope I am.\n\n423\n00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.198\nFrom here, we have to fill out the form.\n\n424\n00:22:50.198 --> 00:22:53.870\nAnd once everything's done, we'll submit\nit into the certificate authority, and\n\n425\n00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.560\nwe should get a certificate right back.\n\n426\n00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.664\nThis time,\nI'm going to give it the common name of my\n\n427\n00:23:01.664 --> 00:23:07.822\nround robin zone instead,\nwhich is RDS.ITPROTVdemo.com.\n\n428\n00:23:07.822 --> 00:23:13.085\nWhat was I showing, yeah,\nwe'll call this one Show.\n\n429\n00:23:13.085 --> 00:23:15.284\nOrganization is ITProTV demo.\n\n430\n00:23:15.284 --> 00:23:20.839\nIT Pro TV demo and then shows.\n\n431\n00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.330\nGainesville, Florida cuz\nthat's exactly where we are.\n\n432\n00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:34.581\nSo we're just filling out the information\nthat the certificate's asking us for.\n\n433\n00:23:34.581 --> 00:23:38.630\nI'm gonna change the bit length, I'm just\ngonna choose 2,048 for our lab demo.\n\n434\n00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:45.518\nOf course, you should be thinking about\nwhatever your security policy is.\n\n435\n00:23:45.518 --> 00:23:48.956\nAnd now it's gonna say, hey,\nwhere do you want to save this request?\n\n436\n00:23:48.956 --> 00:23:51.656\nI'm gonna it put back\ninto my shared folder,\n\n437\n00:23:51.656 --> 00:23:56.358\ncuz I know that that is actually on all\nthe machines that I need to get access to.\n\n438\n00:23:56.358 --> 00:23:59.691\nSo here, we'll do this one for\nthe request.\n\n439\n00:23:59.691 --> 00:24:03.339\nWe'll call this one RDS Request, instead.\n\n440\n00:24:07.383 --> 00:24:08.400\nIt's right there.\n\n441\n00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.497\nLet me go ahead and click Open.\n\n442\n00:24:11.497 --> 00:24:16.556\nI'll finish that up and\nwe'll overwrite it.\n\n443\n00:24:16.556 --> 00:24:21.577\nNow once I have that request and\nI minimize that,\n\n444\n00:24:21.577 --> 00:24:24.770\nclose out of, then we do that.\n\n445\n00:24:26.948 --> 00:24:29.610\nNow, I need to connect into\nmy certificate authority.\n\n446\n00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.657\nSo if I've set that up correctly big IF,\n\n447\n00:24:32.657 --> 00:24:37.060\nI just simply connect back\ninto the certificate authority\n\n448\n00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:46.375\nAnd in a moment,\nit should ask me for, of course,\n\n449\n00:24:46.375 --> 00:24:51.146\ncredentials to connect in and\nthen I can do the proper request here.\n\n450\n00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:56.996\nAs long as I am able to.\n\n451\n00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.873\nAnd it should bring me, of course,\n\n452\n00:25:02.873 --> 00:25:06.246\nto their web page which allows\nme to submit that request.\n\n453\n00:25:06.246 --> 00:25:09.504\nOn the request here, hopefully it's\ndoing its work in the background.\n\n454\n00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:15.836\nI need to find that one and select it.\n\n455\n00:25:21.408 --> 00:25:25.684\nLet me add into the trusted\nsites there and there we go.\n\n456\n00:25:25.684 --> 00:25:28.740\nWe are now, of course,\non the certificate authority.\n\n457\n00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:34.251\nWe're going to request a certificate, And\n\n458\n00:25:34.251 --> 00:25:38.183\neverything apparently take a little bit\nof time once you do the request here.\n\n459\n00:25:40.757 --> 00:25:43.460\nSelect the advanced certificate request.\n\n460\n00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:48.993\nSubmit it by using this basic 64 encoded.\n\n461\n00:25:48.993 --> 00:25:50.550\nInformation that I just copied.\n\n462\n00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.353\nPaste it into the request.\n\n463\n00:25:54.353 --> 00:25:56.360\nChange the template down to web server.\n\n464\n00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:59.256\nSubmit the request.\n\n465\n00:26:01.771 --> 00:26:03.890\nNotice it already issued\nme out a certificate.\n\n466\n00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:13.100\nYes, I want to download that\ncertificate and save it.\n\n467\n00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.119\nPut it back into my folder where\nI saved the previous ones before.\n\n468\n00:26:26.954 --> 00:26:29.520\nAnd I'm gonna replace one that I had\nactually issued a little bit earlier.\n\n469\n00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:34.040\nSo now, that's gonna be saved for\nus and that's what we want.\n\n470\n00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:40.073\nSo once we have that certificate, we now\nneed to install that into our server then.\n\n471\n00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:48.649\nInside of IIS, I need to right-click and\nbring up IIS again.\n\n472\n00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:51.131\nIt looks like I brought it\nup a couple of times here.\n\n473\n00:26:51.131 --> 00:26:54.083\nI'll just bring this backup.\n\n474\n00:26:54.083 --> 00:26:58.870\nI'm gonna complete the certificate\nrequest by going back and\n\n475\n00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:03.485\nfinding the location where I\njust saved that certificate.\n\n476\n00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:09.611\nGive it that friendly name of rds,\nwhich is what I want to do and\n\n477\n00:27:09.611 --> 00:27:12.104\nit's gonna store a copy of\nit in the personal folder.\n\n478\n00:27:12.104 --> 00:27:13.640\nThat's gonna be key.\n\n479\n00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.717\nBecause if you remember last time,\n\n480\n00:27:15.717 --> 00:27:19.328\nwe didn't have the properly\nformatted certificate for RDS.\n\n481\n00:27:19.328 --> 00:27:21.207\nSo we're gonna be able to go in there,\nexport it and\n\n482\n00:27:21.207 --> 00:27:22.890\nget the properly formatted\none that we need.\n\n483\n00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:29.530\nClick OK and that should install it\ninto the web server which will now also,\n\n484\n00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:32.750\nof course, allow us to do some of\nthe other things that we need to do.\n\n485\n00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.911\nNow all of this, you go, do we really?\n\n486\n00:27:35.911 --> 00:27:38.754\nYes, you'll need to do all of it\nif you want this to be ready and\n\n487\n00:27:38.754 --> 00:27:40.270\navailable for you.\n\n488\n00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:41.622\nLet's verify.\n\n489\n00:27:41.622 --> 00:27:45.340\nThe rds is right here and there it is.\n\n490\n00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:48.790\nI need to go to sites as people\nconnected to the rd web.\n\n491\n00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:55.270\nOn the default website,\nI want to select bindings.\n\n492\n00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:58.207\nLet me remove this one, cuz sometimes it.\n\n493\n00:27:58.207 --> 00:27:59.359\nI removed the original.\n\n494\n00:27:59.359 --> 00:28:00.967\nLet me add it back in.\n\n495\n00:28:04.157 --> 00:28:05.844\nUse the proper certificate.\n\n496\n00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:14.550\nI want to enable for SSL, require it.\n\n497\n00:28:18.027 --> 00:28:22.801\nOn the authentication, I want us to use,\nwell, Windows Authentication.\n\n498\n00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:30.813\nSo now, the web server is now configured.\n\n499\n00:28:30.813 --> 00:28:36.997\nSo that when you go to RD web, we should\nend up getting a certificate that can now\n\n500\n00:28:36.997 --> 00:28:44.710\nbe validated across all of those different\ndevices that are gonna connect in as well.\n\n501\n00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.649\nNow I've just switched back over to DC01,\nso\n\n502\n00:28:47.649 --> 00:28:52.511\nthat we can now complete some of those\nconfiguration or the deployment tasks.\n\n503\n00:28:52.511 --> 00:28:58.362\nSo I select the Tasks,\ngo back to Edit Deployment Properties.\n\n504\n00:28:58.362 --> 00:29:01.572\nNotice that there is now a high\navailability setting where there\n\n505\n00:29:01.572 --> 00:29:02.470\nwasn't before.\n\n506\n00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:06.176\nSo, you start seeing high\navailability settings.\n\n507\n00:29:06.176 --> 00:29:11.073\nOn the gateway, we're starting to see,\nthere's the server name that\n\n508\n00:29:11.073 --> 00:29:16.090\neverybody's gonna connect to which\nis gonna be rdsitprotvdemo.com.\n\n509\n00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:19.665\nLicensing, we're gonna do Per User for\nright now.\n\n510\n00:29:19.665 --> 00:29:20.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n511\n00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.937\n&gt;&gt; Web access.\n\n512\n00:29:22.937 --> 00:29:27.280\nWe're gonna change that up in a little\nbit here, but let's select certificates.\n\n513\n00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:33.020\nSo this is where we're gonna change up\nsome things, because of that certificate.\n\n514\n00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.780\nSo, this is where we will add it in.\n\n515\n00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:41.337\nSelect an existing certificate and\nthis is where I will have an issue.\n\n516\n00:29:41.337 --> 00:29:45.580\nBecause I did not say that\nproperly formatted certificate,\n\n517\n00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:49.000\nthat's where we'll have\nto do the export here.\n\n518\n00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.255\n&gt;&gt; Just like we saw before.\n\n519\n00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:51.654\n&gt;&gt; Just like we saw before.\n\n520\n00:29:51.654 --> 00:29:54.245\nOops, maybe if I can actually get this.\n\n521\n00:29:58.686 --> 00:30:01.825\nI have to type in exact,\noop, I can't spell anymore.\n\n522\n00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.935\nI need the manage computer certificates.\n\n523\n00:30:10.896 --> 00:30:12.636\nAnd side of the personal here.\n\n524\n00:30:15.406 --> 00:30:17.130\nWait, I'm on the wrong machine.\n\n525\n00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:19.410\nThat's probably why it's\nnot gonna work there.\n\n526\n00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:20.685\nThere we go.\nI need it on this one.\n\n527\n00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:31.982\nSo I have to be on RD01,\n\n528\n00:30:31.982 --> 00:30:34.904\ncuz that's the certificate that I\nneed to install into that role.\n\n529\n00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:39.423\nSo there it is, the one that's issued.\n\n530\n00:30:39.423 --> 00:30:42.728\nI'm gonna right-click All Tasks and\nExport.\n\n531\n00:30:45.044 --> 00:30:46.960\nI'm gonna go ahead\nan export the private key.\n\n532\n00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:53.027\nMake sure that it actually\nis the .pfx that's saved.\n\n533\n00:30:53.027 --> 00:30:54.322\nAssign a password.\n\n534\n00:31:02.124 --> 00:31:03.679\nClick Next.\n\n535\n00:31:05.019 --> 00:31:07.350\nNow it's gonna say, hey,\nwhat do you want to save this as?\n\n536\n00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.190\nWell, I want it to save it as this.\n\n537\n00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:16.538\nSo this rdf, I went ahead and did a score\npfx, so I knew exactly which one.\n\n538\n00:31:16.538 --> 00:31:19.700\nReplace it,\nbecause I already saved it one time.\n\n539\n00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:21.310\nLet's do that.\n\n540\n00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:24.980\nAnd now we have that certificate up and\nready,\n\n541\n00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:30.210\nand available to get configured,\nand up, and going.\n\n542\n00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:33.914\nSwitch back over to DC01 and\nwe'll just start this process and\n\n543\n00:31:33.914 --> 00:31:36.383\nwe're running a little bit short on time,\n\n544\n00:31:36.383 --> 00:31:40.654\nso we'll just at least start a couple\nof them and we'll get the rest of it.\n\n545\n00:31:40.654 --> 00:31:43.070\nSo, I'm gonna just select\nthe web access for right now.\n\n546\n00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:47.237\nClick on Browse.\n\n547\n00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:55.073\nSo that this is just a reminder and\nwe'll finish this up in the next part of\n\n548\n00:31:55.073 --> 00:31:59.732\nour series instead, but let me at\nleast get this one installed here.\n\n549\n00:31:59.732 --> 00:32:02.465\nI don't feel like I ran through everything\nand didn't at least get one of them-\n\n550\n00:32:02.465 --> 00:32:03.119\n&gt;&gt; Well, Ronnie,\n\n551\n00:32:03.119 --> 00:32:04.294\nit is a lot to configure here.\n\n552\n00:32:04.294 --> 00:32:05.909\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; So you're not running through anything,\n\n553\n00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:08.660\nyou're really taking your time and\nI do appreciate that.\n\n554\n00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:10.069\n&gt;&gt; So, here we go.\n\n555\n00:32:10.069 --> 00:32:11.407\nSo, this is what we'll do.\n\n556\n00:32:11.407 --> 00:32:14.827\nWe'll take that process with that new\ncertificate with the round robin name and\n\n557\n00:32:14.827 --> 00:32:18.990\nwe'll install it on all these different\nservices is what we'll end up seeing here.\n\n558\n00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.774\nAnd then once we get that done, we'll\ncontinue set up for the rest of it and\n\n559\n00:32:22.774 --> 00:32:26.090\nthen test out and see what happens,\nbut that's enough for now.\n\n560\n00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:27.933\nIt looks like we're gonna\nhave to do a part three.\n\n561\n00:32:27.933 --> 00:32:28.637\n&gt;&gt; That's all right.\n\n562\n00:32:28.637 --> 00:32:29.291\nThank you so much.\n\n563\n00:32:29.291 --> 00:32:32.014\nLike I said and thank you, ladies and\ngentleman, but stay tuned.\n\n564\n00:32:32.014 --> 00:32:35.672\nBecause in the next episode,\nwe should complete this process.\n\n565\n00:32:35.672 --> 00:32:38.522\nSo, thank you so much for\nthat and stay tuned.\n\n566\n00:32:38.522 --> 00:32:40.587\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for this particular show.\n\n567\n00:32:40.587 --> 00:32:42.210\nRemember, my name is Cherokee Boose.\n\n568\n00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:43.092\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n569\n00:32:43.092 --> 00:32:46.980\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n570\n00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:52.968\n[MUSIC]\n\n571\n00:32:52.968 --> 00:32:56.373\n&gt;&gt;

watching IP Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.356\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your remote\ndesktop services show.\n\n5\n00:00:14.356 --> 00:00:16.045\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:19.920\nIf you've been following along you'll\nknow this is actually a part three.\n\n7\n00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.220\nWe've been configuring to deploy\nour remote broker connection.\n\n8\n00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.215\nDid I say that right here?\n\n9\n00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:26.880\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n10\n00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.540\n&gt;&gt; All right, just checking.\n\n11\n00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.260\nWhat a mouthful.\n\n12\n00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.920\nBut we've actually gotten quite far, but\nwe're not out of the woods quite yet.\n\n13\n00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.140\nSo here we have Ronnie\nwith us today in studios,\n\n14\n00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.240\nto help us continue with this process.\n\n15\n00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.200\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me back as we\ncontinue on taking a look at some of\n\n16\n00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.400\nthe things that I found this pitfall,\nas well as getting everything configured.\n\n17\n00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.280\nWe started over from scratch,\nwe could have tried at some point\n\n18\n00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.570\nto hobble together what we had done at\nthe very beginning of this series, but\n\n19\n00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.845\nby starting over from scratch,\nthis is normally the way to do it.\n\n20\n00:00:55.845 --> 00:00:59.780\nAnd we're actually right here where\nwe are now installing certificates,\n\n21\n00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.730\nor just finished installing certificates.\n\n22\n00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.670\nI know something that I did\nthat was fairly silly, and\n\n23\n00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.070\nyou'll see it at the end of part two,\nis what happened.\n\n24\n00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.710\nLet me show you what happened here,\nI went back and corrected it, but\n\n25\n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.460\nI did want to make sure that you see this.\n\n26\n00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.260\nSo on my screen, when we were installing\ncertificates, I was going a little bit\n\n27\n00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.220\nfast cuz we were at the end of time,\nand I was feeling a little bit rushed.\n\n28\n00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.310\nWhen I finished installing it, I realized\nI had installed the wrong certificate\n\n29\n00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.200\nfrom the other ones when\neverything had happened.\n\n30\n00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.950\nNow, Cherokee, do you know how\nto tell the difference like if\n\n31\n00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.390\nyou know whether you've installed\nthe wrong certificate or not?\n\n32\n00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.069\n&gt;&gt; We were looking at our file extensions,\nI believe.\n\n33\n00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.533\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the file extensions,\nthat will tell you whether or\n\n34\n00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.510\nnot you can install but\nit's right down here.\n\n35\n00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.510\nIt's kind of strange, but you can see,\nlike here where it says CN.\n\n36\n00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.710\nSo when I had finished installing\nthat first one at the end,\n\n37\n00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.878\nI had actually chosen one that said RD01.\n\n38\n00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:54.600\n&gt;&gt; And that would have been\nthe wrong certificate.\n\n39\n00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.420\nIt wouldn't have prevented\nus from doing anything, but\n\n40\n00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.770\nat the same time it would have done that.\n\n41\n00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.120\nSo every time you finish\ninstalling a certificate,\n\n42\n00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.610\nsince it actually only lets\nyou install one at a time,\n\n43\n00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.040\nmake sure down here in the subject\nline it says what you need it to say.\n\n44\n00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.270\nIf it doesn't, that means you have\nto go back and just reinstall it.\n\n45\n00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.830\nSo every single one of these is actually\ninstalled the way we want it to instead.\n\n46\n00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.810\nNow, remember that you can set\nup a different certificate for\n\n47\n00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.460\neach one of these if you choose to,\nwith a different name.\n\n48\n00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.540\nYou can call one RCB,\nyou can call one RDWA, RDG for gateway.\n\n49\n00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.580\nWhatever you want to do, you can do that.\n\n50\n00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.640\nYou can create all those\ndifferent certificates for\n\n51\n00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.900\nsome situation like this\nthat will help you out.\n\n52\n00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.450\nThat's up to you in your\nchoices of doing that.\n\n53\n00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.740\nBut for me, I just left it simple.\n\n54\n00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.490\nEvery certificate essentially is the same\nthing, and that's gonna be easier.\n\n55\n00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.240\nIf you do this remember,\nwith third party certificates,\n\n56\n00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.070\nyou're probably just gonna use wildcard\ncertificate to help you out instead.\n\n57\n00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.820\nSo that's what you wanna do.\n\n58\n00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.240\n&gt;&gt; All right, so,\nonce we have the certificate\n\n59\n00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.860\nassociated with these particular services,\nwhat's gonna be our next step?\n\n60\n00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.940\n&gt;&gt; Now, normally, everything is now ready.\n\n61\n00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.480\nIt's kind of strange as I now scroll and\nsee something.\n\n62\n00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.220\nVisually, this is gonna be strange here,\nCherokee.\n\n63\n00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.860\nNotice where it says\nremote connection broker?\n\n64\n00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.930\n&gt;&gt; I do see that.\n\n65\n00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.420\n&gt;&gt; Notice where it says\nhigh availability mode.\n\n66\n00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.450\nHow many servers did we configure,\nCherokee?\n\n67\n00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.420\n&gt;&gt; Well, we just started with one.\n\n68\n00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.030\n&gt;&gt; With one, but it's already saying\nit's in high availability mode [LAUGH].\n\n69\n00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Maybe it's psychic, Ronnie.\n\n70\n00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.920\n&gt;&gt; I know, it's kinda weird but\nthat's how you do it.\n\n71\n00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.260\nThey're essentially saying go in and\nset up everything on one server.\n\n72\n00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.300\nGo ahead and do that.\n\n73\n00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.830\nOnce everything is setup on one server\nthen all we have to do is add in a second\n\n74\n00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.700\nconnection broker.\n\n75\n00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.510\nAnd it will configure that one for\nhigh availability as well.\n\n76\n00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.400\nNow when we start doing that there is\na little bit more configuration that we\n\n77\n00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.120\nhave to do, but that's what has to to\nbegin to happen if we're gonna do this.\n\n78\n00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.020\nNow before we go on,\nhere's a couple of other caveats that will\n\n79\n00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.730\nstop you from doing this and\nmaking it successful if you don't do this.\n\n80\n00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.650\nFirst, one of the unusual\nthings about setting up for\n\n81\n00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.490\nhigh availability if I'm going\nto be adding in a second server,\n\n82\n00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.440\nis I have to do something unusual inside\nof Active Directory Directory Services.\n\n83\n00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.200\nI shouldn't say unusual.\n\n84\n00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.820\nI have to make sure of something.\n\n85\n00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.660\nI have to confirm something here.\n\n86\n00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.120\nSo I'm just bringing up the Active\nDirectory Users and Computers here.\n\n87\n00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.964\nInside of the built-in container,\n\n88\n00:04:28.964 --> 00:04:33.678\nthere is a particular group in\n\n89\n00:04:33.678 --> 00:04:38.850\nhere called RDS Management.\n\n90\n00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.710\nRDS Management Servers, I know that's\na little bit difficult to see.\n\n91\n00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.760\nSo RDS Management Servers.\n\n92\n00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.890\nThat one is a built in group.\n\n93\n00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.490\nIf I double-click on that and\nI take look at Members.\n\n94\n00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.030\nNotice that I went ahead and\n\n95\n00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.280\nadded in something,\nwhich is the RDS Connection Brokers.\n\n96\n00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.560\nFor us to be able to do\neverything that we need to,\n\n97\n00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.280\nthe Connection Brokers have to be a member\nof this RDS Management Servers group.\n\n98\n00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n99\n00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.550\n&gt;&gt; That's just a requirement\nthat you wanna make sure of.\n\n100\n00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.982\nYou'd hate for something like\nthat to be your only holdup.\n\n101\n00:05:12.982 --> 00:05:15.700\n&gt;&gt; Right [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So I'm just setting it out there for\n\n102\n00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.680\nus to make sure that we're actually\nright there and doing what we need to.\n\n103\n00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.400\nOnce that is done,\nwe now have to go in and\n\n104\n00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.760\nmodify a little bit on side\nour SQL Server as well.\n\n105\n00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.320\nSo make sure you kind of know that one.\n\n106\n00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.770\nNow I'm gonna click on Windows button,\nand I'm gonna look for\n\n107\n00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.307\nmy SQL Server Management Studio and\nallow that to launch.\n\n108\n00:05:39.307 --> 00:05:46.170\nAnd this in here, that we have to actually\nchange just a couple of options overall.\n\n109\n00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:55.560\nSo now that I'm actually inside of\nthe SQL Server Management, I'm going to\n\n110\n00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.184\nexpand out security,\nand expand out logins.\n\n111\n00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.895\nAnd I'm gonna look at that RDS Connection\nbrokers group which is right there.\n\n112\n00:06:06.895 --> 00:06:13.248\nRight-click, and go down to Properties.\n\n113\n00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:17.340\nAnd it's inside to the properties here,\nand the reason I'm telling you this is now\n\n114\n00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.808\nis, this absolutely fails\nif you don't do this.\n\n115\n00:06:19.808 --> 00:06:21.951\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you need to know [CROSSTALK].\n\n116\n00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:23.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you need to know.\n\n117\n00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.460\nGo to User Mapping.\n\n118\n00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:31.782\nAnd it's inside of User Mapping here,\nthat I need to make sure that I\n\n119\n00:06:31.782 --> 00:06:37.930\ncheckmark the database for\nthe remote servers.\n\n120\n00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.800\nSo this is what I'm saying,\nthe RDS connection brokers,\n\n121\n00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.710\nthey are going to be able\nto access this database.\n\n122\n00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.860\nSo that is pretty much\nthe other one that want.\n\n123\n00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.350\nThe other thing is,\nthose servers are now also gonna become\n\n124\n00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.430\nthe database owner of DB01.\n\n125\n00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.740\nSo that is the other thing that I need to\nmake sure that I have selected on there.\n\n126\n00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.410\nOnce I get that done, click OK.\n\n127\n00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.700\nNow, sometimes you might go, I've never\nhad to do that and that works just fine.\n\n128\n00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.230\nThis is something that I've ran\ninto at least a couple of times\n\n129\n00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.770\nwhere I didn't check this and\nwhen I tried to install it,\n\n130\n00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.400\nit absolutely wouldn't work until these\nthings were actually checked there.\n\n131\n00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.700\nSo do just try and\nmake sure that you understand that\n\n132\n00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:33.360\nyou might have some like that that hinders\nyou from getting everything installed.\n\n133\n00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.230\n&gt;&gt; It's always one little thing.\n\n134\n00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.600\n&gt;&gt; And the weirdest thing.\n\n135\n00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.770\nIt's like two check marks\nessentially is what we did.\n\n136\n00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.400\nWe did a check mark up here, and\nwe did a check mark down here.\n\n137\n00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.340\nBut it's a shame that two check marks\nwould hold you up from deploying\n\n138\n00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.530\nyour RDS server in a high availability\ngroup, but it can happen.\n\n139\n00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.674\nSo definitely it's something\nto kind of point out there.\n\n140\n00:07:53.674 --> 00:07:58.621\nAll right, over on the left-hand side,\nI'm going to select RDS for\n\n141\n00:07:58.621 --> 00:08:00.849\nour remote desktop services.\n\n142\n00:08:00.849 --> 00:08:03.480\nAnd underneath our deployment overview.\n\n143\n00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:11.840\nNow we've got to actually set everything\nup for a second connection broker, okay?\n\n144\n00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.065\nSo now that we are ready for\na high availability,\n\n145\n00:08:15.065 --> 00:08:19.930\nif I right click notice the only\noption that is left for me.\n\n146\n00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.174\nOkay so notice that we already\nwent through what, configuring it?\n\n147\n00:08:23.174 --> 00:08:23.880\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n148\n00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.670\n&gt;&gt; So that makes sense, and now it's\nsaying you've got to configure Ronnie,\n\n149\n00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.360\nit looks like at least according\nRDS everything is working.\n\n150\n00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.970\nSo no need to configure\nanything else here.\n\n151\n00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.930\nNow it says add in RD\nconnection broker service.\n\n152\n00:08:39.125 --> 00:08:44.720\nAll right, so here it is,\nadding in a second connection broker.\n\n153\n00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.360\nRight permissions granted to all,\nhey, that looks familiar.\n\n154\n00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.780\nSQL Server Native Client,\n\n155\n00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.130\nactually, we need to check that out, cuz\nI don't know if that actually finished.\n\n156\n00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:57.770\nSo let me scroll on over to RD02,\nand let's see if we can log in.\n\n157\n00:09:01.342 --> 00:09:05.490\nWe had left this running during\na previous episode as it installed.\n\n158\n00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.350\nSee, I hadn't actually\nfinished installing it.\n\n159\n00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:08.920\nThere we go.\n\n160\n00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.300\nSo at least let this finish installing cuz\nthat's part of those requirements that\n\n161\n00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.040\nit's listing there.\n\n162\n00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.170\nI'm just gonna wait because if\nnot I'll forget it again and\n\n163\n00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:21.650\nsee what ends up happening.\n\n164\n00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:23.230\nBut yeah, that's just some of the things.\n\n165\n00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.810\nAnd the great thing is, it helps you\nout in the installation process, right?\n\n166\n00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.410\nSo the native client is\nbeing installed right now.\n\n167\n00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:30.940\nWe've got a static IP address.\n\n168\n00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.750\nMine's 46.202 and\nthen that DNS resource record,\n\n169\n00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:38.620\nwe already selected that,\nwe changed that as well.\n\n170\n00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.180\nAnd those other two requirements.\n\n171\n00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.070\nNow, I don't wanna say requirements but\nthey are things that I\n\n172\n00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:46.580\nknow that has hindered me from\ngetting that second one added in.\n\n173\n00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.640\nI've done this where it's like, all right,\nit says to add in a second one, go over\n\n174\n00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:54.800\nthere and it says, yeah, it can't find\nthe SQL Server, or no it's not allowed to.\n\n175\n00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.210\nOr there's no permissions to access it.\n\n176\n00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.680\nAnd it's strange in the way\nthat it shows up, right?\n\n177\n00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.070\nWhen you follow this wizard through,\n\n178\n00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:07.240\nit shows you that kind of weird\nconnection string, like this.\n\n179\n00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.420\nAnd it actually prints something\nlike this out for you.\n\n180\n00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.950\nAnd you're saying, well,\nall that connection's good, and\n\n181\n00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.420\nyet that second server's\nstill not connecting in.\n\n182\n00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.470\nIt says, yeah okay, but\nit still doesn't connect in.\n\n183\n00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:23.146\nWell it's those two check marks\nthat we did when we went back\n\n184\n00:10:23.146 --> 00:10:26.168\ninto the studio manager\nto get everything done.\n\n185\n00:10:26.168 --> 00:10:32.310\nAll right so from this point,\nlet me verify over on RD02.\n\n186\n00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:34.840\nNow on this server I don't\nhave anything installed on it.\n\n187\n00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.208\nNo RDS, I think RDS is installed but\nthat's about it.\n\n188\n00:10:38.208 --> 00:10:40.889\nBut, just anything else.\n\n189\n00:10:40.889 --> 00:10:44.303\nClick Next here, and\nnow notice it's asking me,\n\n190\n00:10:44.303 --> 00:10:49.120\nwhich of the two servers do I want to\nadd in the connection broker role?\n\n191\n00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:56.177\nSo I'm gonna select RD02, Select\n\n192\n00:10:56.177 --> 00:11:01.113\nthat one, click Next.\n\n193\n00:11:01.113 --> 00:11:03.812\nAnd in just a moment,\nif everything is right,\n\n194\n00:11:03.812 --> 00:11:08.261\nwe should see something, and this is\nwhere it gets to that point of failure.\n\n195\n00:11:08.261 --> 00:11:11.729\nAnd dejection like I experienced\nwhen I started doing this,\n\n196\n00:11:11.729 --> 00:11:14.420\nand it failed in multiple times here.\n\n197\n00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.490\nSo once you get to this point,\nclick add and\n\n198\n00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:18.970\nwe'll know here in just\na moment if everything is done.\n\n199\n00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.090\nSo, it shows like,\nits progress, it's installing,\n\n200\n00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:23.850\nif it fails,\nyou'll see exactly what I'm talking about.\n\n201\n00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.171\nAnd we'll go back through and\nlist all those things that says, look,\n\n202\n00:11:27.171 --> 00:11:31.363\nhere's the configuration and it's all set\nup right, but you still can't connect in.\n\n203\n00:11:31.363 --> 00:11:34.713\nAnd that's when I had to go and\nresearch a little bit more and\n\n204\n00:11:34.713 --> 00:11:39.140\nfound that option that allowed us to\nconnect back in and made everything work.\n\n205\n00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.355\nSo, if it fails this time, I don't really\nknow exactly what the next option is.\n\n206\n00:11:43.355 --> 00:11:44.232\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] More research, right?\n\n207\n00:11:44.232 --> 00:11:46.680\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, except for more research.\n\n208\n00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.010\nSo the good thing is, it's continuing,\nit's not failing really quickly,\n\n209\n00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.370\nand that to me is a good sign.\n\n210\n00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.233\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; From my experience, if it fails,\n\n211\n00:11:54.233 --> 00:11:55.760\nit usually fails immediately.\n\n212\n00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.383\n&gt;&gt; It'll let you know.\nYeah we're trying to but\n\n213\n00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.376\nat this point in the configuration.\n\n214\n00:11:59.376 --> 00:11:59.942\n&gt;&gt; No Bueno.\n\n215\n00:11:59.942 --> 00:12:02.887\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's looks like everything\nis going to be good but\n\n216\n00:12:02.887 --> 00:12:06.483\nI don't know until the very end of\nthe process in what we need to do.\n\n217\n00:12:06.483 --> 00:12:07.900\n&gt;&gt; We're almost there.\n\n218\n00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.788\n&gt;&gt; Now once everything is done that\nmeans we now need to configure\n\n219\n00:12:12.788 --> 00:12:15.328\nthen a new session collection.\n\n220\n00:12:15.328 --> 00:12:19.494\nOkay and get all that done and then we'll\ntest out the connections and see if\n\n221\n00:12:19.494 --> 00:12:24.150\neverything is working the way that we\nwanted to and that is a good sign, okay.\n\n222\n00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.120\nWhere you see the word succeeded,\nif you don't see the word succeeded\n\n223\n00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.370\nthen you know you've gotta\ndo some more research.\n\n224\n00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.500\nThe great thing is there is so\nmany people that love to do this,\n\n225\n00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.210\nthat have implemented it well.\n\n226\n00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:37.950\nEvery problem,\nI don't wanna say every problem,\n\n227\n00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.897\nthe majority of the problems,\n&gt;&gt; They do, they share their [CROSSTALK]\n\n228\n00:12:39.897 --> 00:12:41.733\n&gt;&gt; They share their information so\n\n229\n00:12:41.733 --> 00:12:43.380\nthat you can find it.\n\n230\n00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:47.290\nAnd I really do, I respect everybody\nthat loves implementing this\n\n231\n00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.650\nbecause they really have put out as so\n\n232\n00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:53.730\nmuch material on it that it makes it\nreally good and really easy to find.\n\n233\n00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.540\nAll right, from this point, look,\nit gives me a warning though.\n\n234\n00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.860\nOkay, it says hey, wait a minute.\n\n235\n00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.306\nWell, before you [CROSSTALK]\ndo anything else, yeah.\n\n236\n00:13:02.306 --> 00:13:07.230\nIt wont say particular certificate here,\nso I can go ahead and configure\n\n237\n00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:13.100\na certificate as well to do this, and\nnow, notice it says, it's erroring out.\n\n238\n00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.640\nThere's something that's trusted but\nI'm not sure.\n\n239\n00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:22.537\nLet's go ahead and\nadd in that certificate again on RD-02.\n\n240\n00:13:22.537 --> 00:13:25.720\nAnd it has access to it, so,\nlet me go ahead and do that.\n\n241\n00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:31.277\nSo, now, we have to play and install,\n\n242\n00:13:34.308 --> 00:13:37.705\nIf I typed it in correctly, we'll see.\n\n243\n00:13:39.622 --> 00:13:43.075\nSo here, it's just going through,\nthe reason why,\n\n244\n00:13:43.075 --> 00:13:46.090\nbecause this role wasn't installed.\n\n245\n00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.530\nEven though it saw that the level was\ntrusted, it's airing out because it didn't\n\n246\n00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.940\nactually see the certificates\nthe way that it needed to.\n\n247\n00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.220\nBut we'll see what happens at this point\nonce we get everything configured here,\n\n248\n00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.920\nin just moment.\n\n249\n00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.230\nHopefully it will just change and\n\n250\n00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:04.480\nthe status will be okay instead of error,\nis what we're looking for.\n\n251\n00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.700\nSo notice it did change to success,\nand I've got another error,\n\n252\n00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.970\nlet me go ahead and fix that one.\n\n253\n00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.640\nCuz if I don't fix it,\nI know I'll run into issues.\n\n254\n00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.523\nLooks like the right certificate.\n\n255\n00:14:20.871 --> 00:14:23.490\nClick OK and apply.\n\n256\n00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.663\nThe great thing is,\nat least the other two,\n\n257\n00:14:27.663 --> 00:14:31.374\nthey're still showing as okay,\nso everything is good.\n\n258\n00:14:31.374 --> 00:14:33.610\nAt this point, and\nseeing what we need it to.\n\n259\n00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.515\nNow, we've still got a little\nbit to go here, okay?\n\n260\n00:14:35.515 --> 00:14:39.085\nSo once that's done,\nwe now need to go in and\n\n261\n00:14:39.085 --> 00:14:45.190\nwe've gotta configure the gateway for\nhigh availability as well.\n\n262\n00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:52.253\nNow, that's not the detailed configuration\nthat we've had to do, so far.\n\n263\n00:14:52.253 --> 00:14:57.060\nI'm trying to see if the state of success,\nthat looks good.\n\n264\n00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.610\nLet's go ahead and click Close and\nclick Close again.\n\n265\n00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:06.841\nSo now hopefully all of those\ndeployment things are now done.\n\n266\n00:15:06.841 --> 00:15:08.020\nYep, trusted, okay.\n\n267\n00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.470\nI just wanted to verify cuz I had\nsome that said succeeded, and\n\n268\n00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:12.747\nthen I had the other ones that didn't.\n\n269\n00:15:12.747 --> 00:15:14.708\nIt's just because they weren't\ninstalled right then, but\n\n270\n00:15:14.708 --> 00:15:15.866\nI always need to verify it, for me.\n\n271\n00:15:15.866 --> 00:15:17.148\nThat always helps me out.\n\n272\n00:15:17.148 --> 00:15:18.098\n&gt;&gt; Networks, yeah.\n\n273\n00:15:18.098 --> 00:15:18.931\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n274\n00:15:18.931 --> 00:15:21.910\nAll right, so now let's go ahead and\nconfigure then the gateway, okay.\n\n275\n00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:25.020\nWe now have a connection\nbroker that says look,\n\n276\n00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.960\nregardless of which one it\ncan handle a connection.\n\n277\n00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.770\nRD 01 fails, connection comes in,\nI can handle it.\n\n278\n00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:35.850\nRD 02 fails,\nthe connection RD 01 can handle it.\n\n279\n00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:37.970\nSo we now have that set up.\n\n280\n00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.530\nBut what about the gateway, right?\n\n281\n00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.660\nThe people that are connecting in.\n\n282\n00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.850\nI don't have to configure that as being\nhighly available if I don't want to, but\n\n283\n00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.680\nI can and that's the next step that\nwe want to do as well, all right?\n\n284\n00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.697\nSo from here let me see if\nI can do it from there.\n\n285\n00:15:54.697 --> 00:16:01.900\nAll right let's go back in now and\nselect servers.\n\n286\n00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.866\nSo if I'm on DC 01, let me make sure I am.\n\n287\n00:16:04.866 --> 00:16:10.523\nYep, so on DC 01,\nI'm going to select RD 01 and\n\n288\n00:16:10.523 --> 00:16:13.434\nselect Gateway Manager.\n\n289\n00:16:13.434 --> 00:16:17.350\nOops, I have to actually be on RD 01,\nI forgot.\n\n290\n00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.250\n&gt;&gt; That's right, you did say that.\n\n291\n00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.190\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I did say that at\nsome point in the series.\n\n292\n00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:21.840\n&gt;&gt; You did.\n\n293\n00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.480\n&gt;&gt; But I forgot.\n\n294\n00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.529\nIt's fairly easy for\nme to forget stuff like that.\n\n295\n00:16:28.339 --> 00:16:29.390\nNow there we go.\n\n296\n00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:33.620\nLet me add in the other server,\nso it doesn't get all confused.\n\n297\n00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.520\nOoh, that's weird.\n\n298\n00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.760\nI've never seen that happen.\n\n299\n00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.810\n&gt;&gt; It's gripping them?\n\n300\n00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:40.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n301\n00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:44.470\nIt started to go ahead and add them all.\n\n302\n00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.270\nLet me just add them all together here.\n\n303\n00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.580\nThen we should be able\nto get in there on RD01.\n\n304\n00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:55.704\nIt always trips me, because it\nrefreshes and it kicks me back out.\n\n305\n00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.750\n&gt;&gt; But we're nearing the home stretch.\n\n306\n00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.540\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully we are nearing\nthe home stretch.\n\n307\n00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.780\nIf I can mess up anymore,\nit'd be right here.\n\n308\n00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:04.650\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n309\n00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:11.110\n&gt;&gt; So here inside of the remote desk,\nDesktop Services Gateway Manager I'm\n\n310\n00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:16.190\ngonna expand out the gateway\nservices here, okay.\n\n311\n00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:16.930\nWhat we're looking for\n\n312\n00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:22.100\nis underneath Policies and\nResource Authorization Policies.\n\n313\n00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.920\nWe can use the default policy here But\n\n314\n00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.130\nthe problem is it's only got one\nserver in it, which is RD01.\n\n315\n00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:33.040\nSo we need to go ahead and\ncreate a new group.\n\n316\n00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.740\nSo at this point,\nI'm going to disable this group,\n\n317\n00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.690\neven though it does work,\nI'm just gonna disable it for now.\n\n318\n00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.929\nI'm gonna select manage\nlocal computer groups.\n\n319\n00:17:47.443 --> 00:17:49.560\nAnd then create a group.\n\n320\n00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.572\nAnd this one we'll call RDS Servers,\njust as an example.\n\n321\n00:17:55.503 --> 00:18:00.260\nUnder the Network Resources, it's gonna\nsay, hey, what do you want to group here?\n\n322\n00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:04.649\nI'm just gonna type in\nthe IP addresses of my RDS\n\n323\n00:18:04.649 --> 00:18:10.334\nservers 201 and 202.\n\n324\n00:18:10.334 --> 00:18:14.340\nThe other thing that I'm\ngoing to do is right here.\n\n325\n00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.570\nNow, notice there's a couple\nof weird things here.\n\n326\n00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:22.750\nIt says enter a name for a computer or\n\n327\n00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:27.550\na remote desktop session host server farm.\n\n328\n00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:31.730\nSo, this is the first time\nwe've ran into this term for\n\n329\n00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:38.010\nWindows Server 2012 in rote desktop\nservices which is server farm.\n\n330\n00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:43.940\nThis was a big term inside of\nthe 2008 world when we did this,\n\n331\n00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.440\nbut overall though,\nthey've kind of dropped this.\n\n332\n00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.870\nAnd the goal is still the same,\n\n333\n00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.870\nit's about grouping the server together\ninto a cluster if we needed to.\n\n334\n00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.910\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie,\nwe've already created your ITPro.Demo.\n\n335\n00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:55.820\nwhat was it, the .com.\n\n336\n00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.000\nIs that what they're referencing here,\nor something different?\n\n337\n00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.330\n&gt;&gt; Well, no,\nthey are referencing exactly that.\n\n338\n00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:04.690\nAnd so\nthat's why I also added in just RDS, okay?\n\n339\n00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:05.270\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n340\n00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:09.680\nthis will also give us that ability\nto make that a resource for us.\n\n341\n00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.180\nAs well.\n\n342\n00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:13.410\nAnd now I've just created this group.\n\n343\n00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.370\nNow even though that group\nis gonna look very familiar,\n\n344\n00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:19.850\nthis is what tripped me up\nkinda the first time here.\n\n345\n00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.430\nWe're about to create a policy and\nyou're gonna go, didn't we just do that?\n\n346\n00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.460\nWell, to a point.\n\n347\n00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.440\nWe created that group and\n\n348\n00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.160\nwe're gonna need to add that group in\na new policy that we're gonna create.\n\n349\n00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.430\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; But the policy's gonna look\n\n350\n00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:30.370\nalmost identical.\n\n351\n00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.350\nThat's the strange thing.\n\n352\n00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:35.610\nSo now if I right click on resources, and\n\n353\n00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:40.060\ncreate a new policy, I'm going to\nselect custom, and here it is.\n\n354\n00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.230\nAnd we'll call this one RDS Servers.\n\n355\n00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:49.940\nIn the user group here,\nI'm gonna select add and\n\n356\n00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.439\nwe'll just let,\nlet's just do domain users.\n\n357\n00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.540\nNow of course if you had a limited\ngroup fo people that were doing this,\n\n358\n00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:02.500\nyou wouldn't select domain users,\nyou'd just select whatever.\n\n359\n00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.670\n&gt;&gt; The few that you want to allow?\n\n360\n00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.870\n&gt;&gt; The few that you\nwanted to get in there.\n\n361\n00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:07.330\nMake sure you do that if you choose to.\n\n362\n00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.540\n&gt;&gt; Or whoever, yeah, however many you had.\n\n363\n00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.040\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n364\n00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:15.890\nThen I'm trying to click\non Network Resource.\n\n365\n00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:19.760\nFrom this point, what I want to\ndo is make sure that I select\n\n366\n00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:27.620\nan Active Directory Domain Services Group,\nclick Browse here.\n\n367\n00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.730\nAnd on the browse,\nlet me make sure I Add this-\n\n368\n00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:32.540\n&gt;&gt; Getting the right name.\n\n369\n00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.421\n&gt;&gt; Correctly here, group.\n\n370\n00:20:37.375 --> 00:20:38.603\nLet me see if I can find it.\n\n371\n00:20:42.127 --> 00:20:45.380\nDid I already call RDS?\n\n372\n00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.775\n&gt;&gt; Users,\nwas it the underscore users there?\n\n373\n00:20:47.775 --> 00:20:50.980\n[INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Let's see if the brokers will work,\n\n374\n00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.540\nwe'll do that one.\n\n375\n00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.205\nThere you go, that is the one, I believe.\n\n376\n00:20:58.525 --> 00:21:01.450\n&gt;&gt; Wait, maybe it's this one,\nI forgot the option.\n\n377\n00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:02.290\nNo there, that's the one.\n\n378\n00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:05.500\nI was gonna say maybe I didn't\ndo the Active Directory one.\n\n379\n00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.960\nIt was this one that I just created.\n\n380\n00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.970\nI was looking for the created one, and I'm\nlike why is it giving me Active Directory?\n\n381\n00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:15.180\nBut that's the one that we just created,\nand there it is, the RDS Server.\n\n382\n00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.130\nThat's the one that I was looking for.\n\n383\n00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:18.480\nI was, it's not in the directory.\n\n384\n00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.380\nSo I'm gonna select that one.\n\n385\n00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.600\nAnd notice it populates all\nthe information that I wanted here.\n\n386\n00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.630\nFrom that point, I'm just reviewing.\n\n387\n00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:31.010\nIt's gonna now allow port\n3389 to connect in, or\n\n388\n00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:33.970\nI can say Look I want to allow all\nthese other ports to connect in.\n\n389\n00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:35.093\nI'm not going to do that.\n\n390\n00:21:35.093 --> 00:21:36.422\n&gt;&gt; We already talked about that.\n\n391\n00:21:36.422 --> 00:21:37.910\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nSo we're just going to limit that.\n\n392\n00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:43.310\nAnd you'll see it looks almost identical,\nright, to the default one?\n\n393\n00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:46.970\nExcept that now, here it is,\nit is saying here's the allowed resources.\n\n394\n00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:48.170\nHere's the group that we're choosing, and\n\n395\n00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.460\nwe just chose local instead\nof a windows group.\n\n396\n00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.540\nPorts enabled and that's pretty much it.\n\n397\n00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.140\nAll right.\n\n398\n00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:59.640\nSo, the great thing is, in theory now,\neverything should be working.\n\n399\n00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.330\nMy particular servers for\nthe Gateway should be RD01, RD02.\n\n400\n00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:08.940\nEverything should be up and\nready to go from that point.\n\n401\n00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:13.360\nAnd once that's done,\nwe just simply create a session host.\n\n402\n00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.470\nSo we're going to be testing?\n\n403\n00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:16.840\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and you are about ready to do so.\n\n404\n00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.800\nSo hopefully everything will fill in and\nnow I need to create a session collection.\n\n405\n00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.280\nThat is the term I was looking for.\n\n406\n00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:34.610\nSelect collections here, and apparently\nI'm faster than the actual Server manager.\n\n407\n00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:36.120\n&gt;&gt; Good job.\n\n408\n00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.815\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the first\ntime that's ever happened.\n\n409\n00:22:37.815 --> 00:22:41.061\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna click on task over on\n\n410\n00:22:41.061 --> 00:22:44.891\nthe right-hand side and\ncreate a section collection.\n\n411\n00:22:48.555 --> 00:22:50.280\nSelect Next.\n\n412\n00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:54.160\nThis time we're just gonna say hey, we're\ngonna create a full desktop Connection.\n\n413\n00:22:58.219 --> 00:23:03.310\nNow, in my server pool,\nI only actually created one for right now.\n\n414\n00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:04.590\nSo we'll add that in there.\n\n415\n00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.380\nThat'll work, we'll use domain.\n\n416\n00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.450\nAnd this is where we have\nto be a little bit careful.\n\n417\n00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:14.900\nWe kind of mentioned it, but\nwe didn't mention this a lot,\n\n418\n00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.700\nthe idea of using what we call UPDs,\nor user profile disks.\n\n419\n00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:23.400\nRemember that now in Windows Server 2012,\nit's no longer about just saving your user\n\n420\n00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:28.020\nprofile into different folders at\na remote location, or another location,\n\n421\n00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:34.030\na shared folder But\nnow we actually can do a shared folder.\n\n422\n00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.390\nBut instead it's gonna create a VHD for\n\n423\n00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:39.400\nevery user is what it's\ngoing to do in here, okay?\n\n424\n00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.270\nSo if I do this, this should be DC01 and\n\n425\n00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:48.210\nthen this should be user,\nI gotta remember.\n\n426\n00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:49.138\nIt's ITProTV.\n\n427\n00:23:49.138 --> 00:23:55.890\nITPro.TV -users.\n\n428\n00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:59.059\n&gt;&gt; And because those VHD files\ncan get rather large in size,\n\n429\n00:23:59.059 --> 00:24:02.968\nyou might wanna consider looking at\nthat maximum there for the quota.\n\n430\n00:24:02.968 --> 00:24:06.025\nBecause you don't wanna just be eating\nup more resources then you have.\n\n431\n00:24:06.025 --> 00:24:06.566\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n432\n00:24:06.566 --> 00:24:08.645\nYeah, so 20 gigs is a little bit large.\n\n433\n00:24:08.645 --> 00:24:11.517\nI need to remember what.\n\n434\n00:24:11.517 --> 00:24:18.460\nUserITprotvdemo_userc,\nUserITprotvdemo_userc.\n\n435\n00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.960\nSo instead, I might go 20 gigs for\neverybody's profile, no way,\n\n436\n00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.736\n2 gigs, maybe max.\n\n437\n00:24:23.736 --> 00:24:25.414\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n438\n00:24:25.414 --> 00:24:27.210\n&gt;&gt; That way it won't do that.\n\n439\n00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:29.760\nNow you do have to worry about\nsomething like this, okay?\n\n440\n00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.520\nWhen you create something\nbesides a full desktop, and\n\n441\n00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:37.110\nyou decided to do remote apps and\nsave those things, You gotta be careful.\n\n442\n00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:41.180\nIt's not gonna save it in that same\nVHD it's gonna save it differently.\n\n443\n00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:46.460\nSo if you do something where you're gonna\nadd in apps wherever this location is\n\n444\n00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:50.026\ngonna be if that's gonna be your standard\nlocation, create a different folder.\n\n445\n00:24:50.026 --> 00:24:55.360\nDo one for like IT Pro TV demo users and\nthen do backslash\n\n446\n00:24:55.360 --> 00:25:00.350\nprofiles as a sub folder and\nthen do apps as another folder, you know.\n\n447\n00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.190\nSeriously, don't mess it up,\n\n448\n00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:07.220\nbecause you can only save to one\nlocation depending on that collection.\n\n449\n00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.060\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So the collection can't just go,\n\n450\n00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:12.240\nyeah I'm gonna merge this into Cherokee's\nprofile that she had on the full desktop.\n\n451\n00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.060\nIt's not gonna do that, so\nit's gonna save it differently.\n\n452\n00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:20.260\nIf you try and do what I thought it would\ndo It's going to corrupt it pretty badly.\n\n453\n00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.826\nAll right.\n\n454\n00:25:21.826 --> 00:25:25.770\nClick Next, and now it says yes, so\n\n455\n00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.840\nI've actually created this\nuser profile disk here.\n\n456\n00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.840\nLet it create, and we'll see here if\neverything's added in the way that we\n\n457\n00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:38.250\nwant to, and then now it's time for\nus to do a check if everything is good.\n\n458\n00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.970\nNow if it's bad, it will fail.\n\n459\n00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:46.240\nThat's pretty much the simple tool\nof this as we'll end up seeing here.\n\n460\n00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:50.240\nSo we now have where it added\nin the actual server for\n\n461\n00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:52.430\nthese collection that\nit's gonna pull from.\n\n462\n00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:55.540\nNow everything should be good.\n\n463\n00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:59.340\nI'm gonna switch on over to our thin PC.\n\n464\n00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:00.640\nSo this is just testing.\n\n465\n00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:05.320\nBefore when we did this, we showed earlier\nin the single server deployment Cherokee,\n\n466\n00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:10.510\nwhere when we connected in to RD 01 and\nthe RD web,\n\n467\n00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:14.730\neven when we opened up the RD gateway and\nwe didn't see any connections, okay?\n\n468\n00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:18.630\nThis time though, we should be able\nto connect through the RD gateway,\n\n469\n00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:20.591\nif everything is set up correctly.\n\n470\n00:26:23.034 --> 00:26:28.109\n[SOUND] So now, I should just be\n\n471\n00:26:28.109 --> 00:26:32.986\nable to type in RDS IT PRO TV.\n\n472\n00:26:32.986 --> 00:26:36.034\nOops, thank you.\n\n473\n00:26:36.034 --> 00:26:41.450\nDemo dot com RD-\n&gt;&gt; Moment of truth.\n\n474\n00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:42.880\n&gt;&gt; Web.\n\n475\n00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:43.630\nOr failure.\n\n476\n00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:44.684\nOne of the two.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n477\n00:26:44.684 --> 00:26:46.030\n&gt;&gt; Is what we'll end up seeing here.\n\n478\n00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:53.190\nSo, in a moment, if this connects in,\nwe should see it happen.\n\n479\n00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:55.380\nIf it doesn't, that means a little\nbit more troubleshooting is involved.\n\n480\n00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.420\n&gt;&gt; Because this is what those end users\nwould be doing if they were trying to\n\n481\n00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.170\nconnect remotely.\n\n482\n00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:00.560\nThis is where they would go ahead and\ntype it in and check it out.\n\n483\n00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.560\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n484\n00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.310\nSo I know that I'm experiencing some\nissues with that certificate, okay?\n\n485\n00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.450\nAnd I know that there\nis a reason behind it,\n\n486\n00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:11.070\nand I'll explain what that reason is\nright now, in just a moment here, but\n\n487\n00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:15.050\nlet me connect to this website just\nto see if we're getting through.\n\n488\n00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:15.570\nThat's good.\n\n489\n00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:19.960\nOn the certificate error, let me\ncheck this out and verify something.\n\n490\n00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:24.980\nOkay Now here is the reason why it's\nprobably not connecting through, notice it\n\n491\n00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:31.700\nsays that here it is the rds demo, so we\nknow that is working at this point here.\n\n492\n00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:36.150\nBut something else that I might have\nforgotten to set which is probably going\n\n493\n00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:41.420\nto be inside the path of that\ncertificate I'm assuming.\n\n494\n00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:45.170\nAt least I believe that I'm gonna do that,\nbut let me see if it just connects in for\n\n495\n00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:45.734\nright now.\n\n496\n00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:48.754\nUser 01.\n\n497\n00:27:53.429 --> 00:27:55.307\nLet me see if I can sign in.\n\n498\n00:27:55.307 --> 00:27:59.110\nSo I can sign in here but\nI'm gonna have issues because of that.\n\n499\n00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:01.510\nSo I probably need to go back in and\ntroubleshoot some of the certificates,\n\n500\n00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:05.320\nwhere did I Remember I told you that at\none point I put in the wrong certificate.\n\n501\n00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.690\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; For something.\n\n502\n00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.390\nSo it might be right there.\n\n503\n00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:10.970\nSo there may be a little bit\nmore troubleshooting to be done\n\n504\n00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:11.720\non something like that.\n\n505\n00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.970\nLet's click on the full desktop and\nsee what we end up getting.\n\n506\n00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:19.083\nMaybe, maybe nothing.\n\n507\n00:28:26.011 --> 00:28:27.120\nThere we go.\n\n508\n00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.920\nThis is what we didn't want to see, okay?\n\n509\n00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:32.930\nSo normally, when everything\nis actually set up correctly,\n\n510\n00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.030\nyou should see where\nthe publisher says what?\n\n511\n00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:38.130\nHey, this is exactly who published this.\n\n512\n00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:41.390\nAnd here is the actual right computer.\n\n513\n00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:44.810\nSo we're normally looking for\nthis, but without this bar.\n\n514\n00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:49.230\nWe're also making sure of course then\nthat we need to come back in and\n\n515\n00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:51.880\nbe able to figure this\nportion out as well.\n\n516\n00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.580\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n517\n00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.260\n&gt;&gt; So that means a little bit more\ntroubleshooting needs to be done and\n\n518\n00:28:55.260 --> 00:29:00.360\nwe'll have to go back through and figure\nsomething like that out as well, okay.\n\n519\n00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:04.720\nJust a little bit more but that also gives\nus a little bit of time as we figure out\n\n520\n00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:09.480\nthe trouble shooting hitter to\nalso take a look at in a future\n\n521\n00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:14.500\nepisode of also load balancing\nwith difference session host too.\n\n522\n00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.250\nSo we'll probably combine that\nall together as we continue\n\n523\n00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:18.550\non through the series.\n\n524\n00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:19.410\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like a plan and\n\n525\n00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:23.380\nwe have accomplished quite a bit in\nthe last three episodes here but\n\n526\n00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.900\nstay tuned because we dp have more\nremote desktop services headed your way.\n\n527\n00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:30.020\nI'm gonna go ahead and sign off,\nI was your show host Cherokee Boose\n\n528\n00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:30.910\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong,\n\n529\n00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:34.036\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITPRO

Welcome to your remote\ndesktop service series.\n\n4\n00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:17.800\nI'm your show host Cheryl Boose.\n\n5\n00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.270\nIn this episode we will continue to\nconfigure high availability services.\n\n6\n00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.720\nAnd who better to help us with\nthat than Mr. Ronnie Wong himself.\n\n7\n00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.200\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n8\n00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.340\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back as\nwe are continuing in our series here.\n\n9\n00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.690\nWe have now moved in to that\nrealm of high availability.\n\n10\n00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.810\nWe're in the very last episode or\nlast three episodes I think.\n\n11\n00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.860\nWe should you how to configure high\navailability for the connection broker and\n\n12\n00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.330\nthen we went into of course\nthe session host and started there.\n\n13\n00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.920\nAnd we were testing for the connection and\nwe had a couple of issues here.\n\n14\n00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.680\nNow we did resolve the issue but\nlet's go ahead and take a look and\n\n15\n00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.950\nthat way we'll have a good reminder\nof where we just left off.\n\n16\n00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.740\nSo, last thing that we did is that we\nconnected in from the actual client.\n\n17\n00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.130\n&gt;&gt; So, we were testing from that\nclient's side for connectivity.\n\n18\n00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.020\n&gt;&gt; Right, we were testing from the\nclient's side and instead of what we were\n\n19\n00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.790\ndoing with the single server\ndeployment where we had RD01,\n\n20\n00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.500\nnotice that we're now using\nthat round-robin DNS entry\n\n21\n00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.660\ninstead and that gives us that active,\nactive cluster that we really want.\n\n22\n00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.500\nSo we at least know something,\nthat that is working.\n\n23\n00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.820\nIt is saying hey, here's the server\nyou're going to connect to.\n\n24\n00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.260\nAnd the more that I open up tabs,\nin theory if I could actually do it fast\n\n25\n00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.750\nenough, it should start passing\nit off between the two.\n\n26\n00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.020\nBut I've only got one open.\n\n27\n00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.530\nFrom here we just simply were testing\nout if the connectivity was good.\n\n28\n00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.170\nSo I'm doing the same thing\non this particular episode.\n\n29\n00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.605\nVerifying that we can connect in.\n\n30\n00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:49.447\nIn just a moment unless I mistyped\nsomething we should be able to connect in\n\n31\n00:01:49.447 --> 00:01:53.838\nand get access to the different\napplications that we have on here.\n\n32\n00:01:53.838 --> 00:01:57.280\nNow, the only thing that I made was\njust a simple remote desktop connection,\n\n33\n00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.240\nthat allows us of course to do that\nfull desktop connection as we go in and\n\n34\n00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.280\nI'm beginning to doubt my\nparticular typing abilities.\n\n35\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.670\nBut, I do want you to see something\nif I can make this happen there,\n\n36\n00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.070\nit happened too fast.\n\n37\n00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.620\nNow, if you go back and\nwatch this during the recording,\n\n38\n00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.970\nyou'll notice something in\nthe lower left-hand corner.\n\n39\n00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.130\nI don't wanna try and attempt it\nagain cuz it'll probably change, but\n\n40\n00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.440\nit did show the IP address\nthat we were connecting to.\n\n41\n00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.140\nAnd everything that we were connecting to\nbefore was RD 01, which was 10.0.46.201.\n\n42\n00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.410\nBut if you'll in the recording,\nif you back this back up-\n\n43\n00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.400\n&gt;&gt; It switched to .202?\n\n44\n00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.850\n&gt;&gt; It switched to .202 so\n\n45\n00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.600\nthat way you know that it is\ndoing what it says it's doing.\n\n46\n00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.910\n&gt;&gt; The round robin theory.\n\n47\n00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.270\n&gt;&gt; From right here because we\ncreated that session collection\n\n48\n00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.370\nnow that the host servers\nare now bound that way,\n\n49\n00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.150\nI can now click on this full desktop and\nthis is what we get right here.\n\n50\n00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.840\nWhich, of course, is the server.\n\n51\n00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.830\nRemember that if we don't have the right\ncertificate, this is not gonna work.\n\n52\n00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.820\nSo make sure you check\nyour certificates out.\n\n53\n00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:01.224\nWe click OK, enter in our, Credentials.\n\n54\n00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:08.090\nAnd here, there's a couple of things\ngoing on and I wanted to point this out.\n\n55\n00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.370\nBecause you may go,\nlook, Ronnie's cheating.\n\n56\n00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.470\nHe's just skipping right by this, but\nI want you to notice something here.\n\n57\n00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.200\nIt's saying, look, the revocation check\ncould not be performed on the certificate.\n\n58\n00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.060\nThis is possible of one of two things,\nright?\n\n59\n00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.270\nOne is that I didn't\nactually publish the CRL.\n\n60\n00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.920\n&gt;&gt; The CRL.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n61\n00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.630\nI didn't publish the CRL so\nit's not gonna be able to do that.\n\n62\n00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.910\nAnd that's very possible\nsince I reset up this lab,\n\n63\n00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.510\nit's very possible I\njust didn't publish that.\n\n64\n00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.100\nSo check that out if\nyou're using internal one.\n\n65\n00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.380\nGreat thing is, third party one,\nyou don't every have to worry about that.\n\n66\n00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.840\nThe other though, is that by default,\nespecially on the Windows 10 PC,\n\n67\n00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.270\nthe one that I have,\nit's not designed to check it.\n\n68\n00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.370\nIt's not gonna check a CRL.\n\n69\n00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.510\nSo there is a way you can go in and modify\nthe registry on a regular Windows 7 or\n\n70\n00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.140\nWindows 8 desktop.\n\n71\n00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.730\nBut this doesn't give us\naccess to the registry.\n\n72\n00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.230\nSo I can't go in and modify and tell hey,\nyou've got to make sure you can contact\n\n73\n00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.850\nthe CRL and\nmake sure that all checked up too.\n\n74\n00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.970\nSo, this is one of those two possiblities,\n\n75\n00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.070\non this one,\nis my thin PC that's doing it.\n\n76\n00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.770\nSo I already checked.\n\n77\n00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.690\nThat's how I know that.\n\n78\n00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.830\nFrom that point I just click yes,\nand now we should connect in.\n\n79\n00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.520\nNow when we connect in,\nhere's the key, right?\n\n80\n00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.760\nHow do I know which one it's using?\n\n81\n00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.940\nYou're not going to, okay?\n\n82\n00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.070\nBefore when we were doing this and\nI was just connecting to one server,\n\n83\n00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.200\nlet me see if I zoom out,\nyou would end up taking a look here and\n\n84\n00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.150\nthis is the actual server it kind\nof zoomed in on which is RD01 So,\n\n85\n00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.020\neven though the web portal connected me to\nRD02, now, when I make that full desktop,\n\n86\n00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.320\nit went back to RD01, so,\nI know exactly which server.\n\n87\n00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.250\nNow, if it shows up as RDS, it's saying,\nhey, well, I'm not exactly sure which one\n\n88\n00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.470\nyou're connecting to, but that gives\nyou at least a hint of what's going on.\n\n89\n00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.730\nAll right, so,\nthe good thing is that is operational.\n\n90\n00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.970\nThat is exactly what we need.\n\n91\n00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.640\nBecause that's what\nthe connection broker does, right?\n\n92\n00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.010\nIt allows us to balance that role.\n\n93\n00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.270\nIf one of those servers turns off,\nthe other one can still perform.\n\n94\n00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.370\nBut both of them are really\ndoing the action\n\n95\n00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.640\nof where they're choosing\nto connect us to.\n\n96\n00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.760\nSo we've tested that out fully\nin the way that we want.\n\n97\n00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.000\nNow what about those other role services?\n\n98\n00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.620\nThat's where we want to get to.\n\n99\n00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.150\nI'm going to come back over here to DCO1,\nand let's see if it's logged me out yet.\n\n100\n00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.940\nSometimes I have to check.\n\n101\n00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.560\nSo, here's the session host, and\nover on the right-hand side, notice I can\n\n102\n00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.630\nsee where I have the roles that\nare actually I already configured for H.\n\n103\n00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.310\nA.\n\n104\n00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.550\nThere's the connection broker on RD 01\nhere's the connection broker on RD 02.\n\n105\n00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.700\nNotice that the session host on RD 01 and\nanother session host right here on RD 02.\n\n106\n00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:55.820\nBut on the rest of these out you'll see\nlike gateway there's only one on RD 01.\n\n107\n00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.880\nWeb access, only that one as well and\nthen even the licensing.\n\n108\n00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.110\nThe licensing I'm just gonna leave\nalong and not worry about it so\n\n109\n00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.460\nmuch is what we're gonna do.\n\n110\n00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.340\n&gt;&gt; So obviously, we need to have\nthem on at least two machines to\n\n111\n00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.730\nbe technically high availability and\nwe need to configure those other services.\n\n112\n00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:13.450\n&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.\n\n113\n00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.770\nSo there's a couple of things\nthat can be done at this point.\n\n114\n00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.020\nNow if you set it up the way that we did,\nwhich is essentially just\n\n115\n00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.660\nusing DNS round robining, to give us\nthe active-active cluster that's fine.\n\n116\n00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.960\nBut before this point, right,\nif you're running like Server 2008,\n\n117\n00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.790\nwe didn't have that setup\nto make sure that happened.\n\n118\n00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.720\nWhat we normally did, is we used something\ncalled NLB, the Network Load Balancer.\n\n119\n00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.470\nIt's a software load balancer that\nyou can install inside of Windows And\n\n120\n00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.084\nyou can still do that if you choose to but\nwhen you do so, the drawback,\n\n121\n00:06:45.084 --> 00:06:49.215\nat least according to what Windows\nare saying is that it only gives you that\n\n122\n00:06:49.215 --> 00:06:53.760\nactive-passive cluster okay, so\nthat means it only kicks in,\n\n123\n00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.890\nif the other one fails,\nmachine running that's fine but\n\n124\n00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.132\nit's never gonna do the\n&gt;&gt; Increase that performance.\n\n125\n00:07:01.132 --> 00:07:01.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n126\n00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.440\nYeah, if you wanna increase\nthe performance without doing that then,\n\n127\n00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.790\nyou have to go to a hardware load balancer\nand depending on your organization, right?\n\n128\n00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.140\nYou may go Round Robin DNS, nah,\n\n129\n00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.280\nI'll depend on my-\n&gt;&gt; DNS.\n\n130\n00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll depend on my\nhardware load balancer instead.\n\n131\n00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.550\nSo there are other ways to accomplish what\nwe're talking about but for us we're going\n\n132\n00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.950\nto use the one that is recommended\nby Microsoft to help us do this.\n\n133\n00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.050\nThe great thing is the rest\nof this is relatively simple.\n\n134\n00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.310\nI say relatively simple, there are still a\nfew gotchas that can can get in the way if\n\n135\n00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.970\nyou're not careful so that's what we\nalso want to take a look at here.\n\n136\n00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.380\nSo let's go ahead and\nconfigure then the idea of load balancing.\n\n137\n00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.000\nNot load balancing, we'll talk about\nload balancing here in a moment, too.\n\n138\n00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.280\nBut let's configure this idea\nof high availability for\n\n139\n00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.060\nthe remaining services that we need to.\n\n140\n00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.528\nSo, for instance, let's do the gateway\nbecause that's kind of the big one, right?\n\n141\n00:07:53.528 --> 00:07:57.837\nInstead of having everybody point to one\nmachine, I may want to distribute that,\n\n142\n00:07:57.837 --> 00:07:59.405\nand simply be able to do that.\n\n143\n00:07:59.405 --> 00:08:04.240\nSo the great thing is, it's already\nconfigured at least one gateway.\n\n144\n00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.946\nWhich means up and operating.\n\n145\n00:08:05.946 --> 00:08:10.640\nIf I right click on the icon\nunder the Deployment Overview,\n\n146\n00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.320\nI can now Add a RD Gateway Server.\n\n147\n00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.670\nAnd when I do that, it will now give\nme the option of all of the servers of\n\n148\n00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:20.340\ncourse, inside the server pool.\n\n149\n00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.150\nThat is enabled to do this.\n\n150\n00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:27.010\nNow the great thing is,\nI know that only RD02 has the role that I\n\n151\n00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:31.720\nneed on there which is the RD Gateway, cuz\nI installed it when it actually installed.\n\n152\n00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.610\nSo I simply select that, I click on\nthe right arrow to join that over.\n\n153\n00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.929\nAnd then I click Next.\n\n154\n00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:44.831\nNow, the great thing about the way\nthat Windows Server 2012 does this,\n\n155\n00:08:44.831 --> 00:08:48.964\nis that if I didn't, let's say\nthat I just brought up a brand new\n\n156\n00:08:48.964 --> 00:08:53.425\nWindows Server 2012 R2, and\nI didn't install any roles on it.\n\n157\n00:08:53.425 --> 00:08:56.190\nIt'll go ahead and\ninstall the role on it for us, too.\n\n158\n00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.730\nSo we don't have to go over and\ninstall that first, and then come back.\n\n159\n00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.440\nIt will install it if it\ndoesn't see it as well.\n\n160\n00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.850\nSo I just verify, and look at\nthe actual gateway connection here.\n\n161\n00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:12.774\nIt's rds.itprotvdemo.com.\n\n162\n00:09:12.774 --> 00:09:14.476\nAnd I'll have to come\nback to this in a moment,\n\n163\n00:09:14.476 --> 00:09:17.063\ncuz I wanted to make sure that we\nwere connecting through the gateway.\n\n164\n00:09:17.063 --> 00:09:19.648\nAnd that's something we still\nhaven't actually proven yet.\n\n165\n00:09:19.648 --> 00:09:20.649\nSo are we gonna test that?\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n166\n00:09:20.649 --> 00:09:22.274\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we'll try and\n\n167\n00:09:22.274 --> 00:09:25.180\ntest that out in just a moment as well.\n\n168\n00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:29.210\nSo let's let this install now,\nand get it up and running.\n\n169\n00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.450\nRemember that before,\nwhen we were doing the testing,\n\n170\n00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.620\nwe did connect in to one of\nthose servers which was fine.\n\n171\n00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.572\nBut the very fact is we\nstill don't really know,\n\n172\n00:09:38.572 --> 00:09:41.391\nyou know at all,\nif we're using the gateway.\n\n173\n00:09:41.391 --> 00:09:42.861\nWe have a gateway setup,\n\n174\n00:09:42.861 --> 00:09:47.416\nbut we may not have it setup to where\neverybody connects through the gateway.\n\n175\n00:09:47.416 --> 00:09:51.690\nAnd this is dependent upon your\norganization more than anything else.\n\n176\n00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.130\nNormally, this is the default\nway that it's setup is simple.\n\n177\n00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.400\nIf you're connecting him from\noutside of that network,\n\n178\n00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.820\nthan it says use the gateway.\n\n179\n00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.066\nBut what if you're like me\non my test machine, and\n\n180\n00:10:04.066 --> 00:10:06.406\nyou're inside of that same network.\n\n181\n00:10:06.406 --> 00:10:07.752\nWell, I'm not gonna make.\n\n182\n00:10:07.752 --> 00:10:08.727\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It makes more sense.\n\n183\n00:10:08.727 --> 00:10:10.286\n&gt;&gt; A connection outside and\nthen come back in.\n\n184\n00:10:10.286 --> 00:10:11.814\n&gt;&gt; To generate yeah, less traffic.\n\n185\n00:10:11.814 --> 00:10:13.539\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, to generate less traffic.\n\n186\n00:10:13.539 --> 00:10:16.010\nIt just says let's bypass the gateway.\n\n187\n00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.300\nSo we need to take a look at that\nconfiguration but before we do so,\n\n188\n00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.680\nlet me get this role installed and then\nwe'll take a look at that connection too.\n\n189\n00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.390\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n190\n00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:27.560\nit's just taking of course a sweet time\nin configuring everything that needs.\n\n191\n00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.187\nBut let's, actually we'll do it\nwhile it's trying to do the steps.\n\n192\n00:10:31.187 --> 00:10:31.717\nI'll just pull this up.\n\n193\n00:10:31.717 --> 00:10:32.527\n&gt;&gt; Look at that time management.\n\n194\n00:10:32.527 --> 00:10:33.800\n&gt;&gt; We'll try.\n\n195\n00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.400\nSo here it is.\n\n196\n00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.580\nWe are connecting in, and I'm gonna\ndo the same thing we just did here.\n\n197\n00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.366\nIT Pro, if I can spell it.\n\n198\n00:10:40.366 --> 00:10:41.574\nYou'd think I would be able to spell this,\n\n199\n00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:43.127\nafter how many times I've\ntyped this during the show.\n\n200\n00:10:43.127 --> 00:10:45.862\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you never know.\n\n201\n00:10:45.862 --> 00:10:47.850\nAnd there's something else\nI also wanted to point out.\n\n202\n00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.396\nThere's all these things that's\nfloating around in my head, and\n\n203\n00:10:50.396 --> 00:10:53.349\nwell you were talking about the idea of\nthe way that your mind works as a browser\n\n204\n00:10:53.349 --> 00:10:54.226\nwith multiple tasks.\n\n205\n00:10:54.226 --> 00:10:55.920\n&gt;&gt; Multiple tabs open, yep.\n\n206\n00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.120\n&gt;&gt; Mine is one browser\nwith broken tabs all open,\n\n207\n00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.970\nand I just remember them\nat random points in time.\n\n208\n00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:07.302\nSo, how do I test if this is actually\nconnecting through my gateway.\n\n209\n00:11:07.302 --> 00:11:11.540\nWell, the way that we do that is,\nlet's come back over.\n\n210\n00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.996\nGreat it succeed that's fine.\n\n211\n00:11:13.996 --> 00:11:17.393\nNow, what I would do since I\nhave an active connection,\n\n212\n00:11:17.393 --> 00:11:20.662\nis I could click on servers\naround the left hand side.\n\n213\n00:11:20.662 --> 00:11:23.061\nAnd then let me select RD01,\n\n214\n00:11:23.061 --> 00:11:27.710\ncuz that's the only one that I\nhad available at that point.\n\n215\n00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.760\nAnd go to gateway manager.\n\n216\n00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.957\nI forgot I was in DC01.\n\n217\n00:11:32.957 --> 00:11:33.533\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] It's all right.\n\n218\n00:11:33.533 --> 00:11:34.320\n&gt;&gt; I need to go RD01.\n\n219\n00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:37.497\n&gt;&gt; There you go,\n\n220\n00:11:37.497 --> 00:11:40.610\nall these little things that always jump\nup at you when you're not expecting it.\n\n221\n00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:44.826\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, if we were working in just,\nif we didn't have this GUI to work with,\n\n222\n00:11:44.826 --> 00:11:47.369\nwould a trace route be\napplicable in this sense?\n\n223\n00:11:47.369 --> 00:11:52.092\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you could, if you were on\nthe outside of your network, you could.\n\n224\n00:11:52.092 --> 00:11:56.503\nOn the inside of your network, you're not\ngonna be able to trace a computer that's\n\n225\n00:11:56.503 --> 00:12:01.056\ntrying to connect directly inside, but\nwe're jumping between different routers.\n\n226\n00:12:01.056 --> 00:12:02.139\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Just to see if you're going\n\n227\n00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:02.764\nthrough that gateway.\n\n228\n00:12:02.764 --> 00:12:05.460\n&gt;&gt; Yep, but\nnot when you're both on the same inside.\n\n229\n00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.140\nThe way that we test this\nis out is we go to here,\n\n230\n00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.590\nwe select the actual gateway server and\n\n231\n00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:16.050\nthen you have this nice little graphic\nright here, total number of connections.\n\n232\n00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:19.416\nSo I am connected according to\nmy client I'm connected, but\n\n233\n00:12:19.416 --> 00:12:21.074\nnotice right here Cherokee.\n\n234\n00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:22.098\n&gt;&gt; A zero.\n&gt;&gt; Zero.\n\n235\n00:12:22.098 --> 00:12:25.289\n&gt;&gt; Per se.\n&gt;&gt; Even if I select active connection.\n\n236\n00:12:25.289 --> 00:12:26.310\nYeah.\n\n237\n00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:30.940\nSo there is an issue if I wanted to\ntest and see if my gateway is working.\n\n238\n00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.540\nNow I could simply just put my\ncomputer on to a different network.\n\n239\n00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.570\nI mentioned this in a previous episode,\nthe easiest way as of your network if\n\n240\n00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.130\ninside you go how do I test this,\nwhat the best way for me?\n\n241\n00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.530\nIf you're on a laptop jump onto your\nwireless, if you're in guest network\n\n242\n00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:49.380\nswitch on to guest network try and\nmake that remote desktop connection.\n\n243\n00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.740\nIf you do, then you know that\neverything is good and gone, but for\n\n244\n00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.900\nme I don't have that ability\nsince I'm using virtual machines.\n\n245\n00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:01.310\nBut there are some things I can\nchange that will help me out.\n\n246\n00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:05.690\nThe way that we can do this then,\nis now that I know that I am not possibly\n\n247\n00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:10.290\ndoing it I'm gonna come\nback over to my overview.\n\n248\n00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:14.950\nLet me go back to DC01 to overview, and\n\n249\n00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.100\nthen under the deployment\noverview I'm gonna select task.\n\n250\n00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.450\nAnd then edit deployment properties.\n\n251\n00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.440\nSelect RD Gateway.\n\n252\n00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.550\nAnd here's an option that will\nhelp us to test it out at least.\n\n253\n00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.180\nNow that I'm zoomed in on\nthe RD Gateway options,\n\n254\n00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.250\nhere is the check mark I may\nwant to remove for testing out.\n\n255\n00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:41.175\nBypass the RD Gateway server for\nthe local address.\n\n256\n00:13:41.175 --> 00:13:48.015\nSince mine is on the same network here,\nI'm going to uncheck that.\n\n257\n00:13:48.015 --> 00:13:51.431\nClick Apply, and hopefully it applies.\n\n258\n00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:53.050\nClick OK.\n\n259\n00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:55.765\nNow let's make the same connection again,\nand then we'll come back and\n\n260\n00:13:55.765 --> 00:13:56.505\nsee if it works.\n\n261\n00:13:57.565 --> 00:13:59.565\n&gt;&gt; Ronny, so\nwhat we're doing now is we're testing for\n\n262\n00:13:59.565 --> 00:14:03.055\nthat connectivity to make sure that\nwe are going through that gateway.\n\n263\n00:14:03.055 --> 00:14:06.835\nAnd we're looking to see if we can add\nthat one within our management console.\n\n264\n00:14:06.835 --> 00:14:10.279\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right, the very\nfact is we do need to test this out.\n\n265\n00:14:10.279 --> 00:14:13.955\nNow that that second gateway\nserver has originally been added.\n\n266\n00:14:13.955 --> 00:14:17.627\nNow there's a couple of other things that\nwe need to make sure of, before we go and\n\n267\n00:14:17.627 --> 00:14:18.640\nswitch to that.\n\n268\n00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.610\nLet's go back to my screen here for\njust a moment.\n\n269\n00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:24.770\nSo I'm gonna click on Edit\non the Deployment task,\n\n270\n00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:28.000\nunderneath the deployment Overview.\n\n271\n00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.180\nSelect Edit Deployment Properties.\n\n272\n00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.280\nAnd it's here we've gotta pay\nattention to a few things,\n\n273\n00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.440\nbecause of the way that\nmy configuration is.\n\n274\n00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.390\nNow if yours is different you won't\nhave to worry too much about this, but\n\n275\n00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:42.630\nalways check the certificates here\nthat everything says trusted and okay.\n\n276\n00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:46.180\nIf it doesn't especially\nthe web access and the gateway.\n\n277\n00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.981\nIf you click on web access, this is\nwhere you get a nice little warning.\n\n278\n00:14:49.981 --> 00:14:51.945\nLet me make sure that we can see that.\n\n279\n00:14:51.945 --> 00:14:53.046\nLet me zoom in here.\n\n280\n00:14:53.046 --> 00:14:54.424\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] And\nwe'll see our little error message.\n\n281\n00:14:54.424 --> 00:14:58.295\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a little warning that says,\nhey, both of these are on the same\n\n282\n00:14:58.295 --> 00:15:02.880\nserver., so if you do this, make sure\nthey're using the same certificate.\n\n283\n00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.790\nBecause they're on that same server.\n\n284\n00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:07.800\nIf not, you're gonna get issues\nthat will come about and\n\n285\n00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.600\nyou won't be able to connect.\n\n286\n00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.380\nNow, there's only one other\nthing that I've also seen,\n\n287\n00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.330\nthat's kind of hindered me before, too.\n\n288\n00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:19.030\nBecause we've installed those roles,\non different servers.\n\n289\n00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:22.840\nSo, here on RD1,\nmake sure I can still connect in there.\n\n290\n00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.770\nWe also have what we call\na network policy server.\n\n291\n00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:31.740\nSo this is a network access policy,\nif I right click in network policy server,\n\n292\n00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:35.340\nwell you may have to do this, especially\nif we're gonna use this remote gateway.\n\n293\n00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.020\nNow I'm doing this for\n\n294\n00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.860\nthe sake of testing,\nmaking sure that we are using the gateway.\n\n295\n00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:44.181\nThe only other thing that we\nmay have to do is verify,\n\n296\n00:15:44.181 --> 00:15:49.995\nthat our NPS server here is actually\nregistered in Active Directory.\n\n297\n00:15:49.995 --> 00:15:51.302\nNow if you don't have that,\n\n298\n00:15:51.302 --> 00:15:54.368\nit should be just bright like this\none up here where it says stop it.\n\n299\n00:15:54.368 --> 00:15:57.760\nBut if it's already registered\nit will show up here in gray.\n\n300\n00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.430\nSo make sure that's running on all of your\nservers that are running in that high\n\n301\n00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.420\navailability mode.\n\n302\n00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:07.620\nOnce all that's done, all we have to do\nnow is verify by going to our client.\n\n303\n00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:09.810\n&gt;&gt; Woohoo.\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna switch on over to our client.\n\n304\n00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:11.241\nAnd remember what we're trying to do,\nCherokee,\n\n305\n00:16:11.241 --> 00:16:12.530\nright we're trying to get that one.\n\n306\n00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Is what we're trying to do to make\n\n307\n00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.580\nsure that we're going through the gateway.\n\n308\n00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.560\nIf we don't get the one, then we know\nwe've failed in terms of setting it up.\n\n309\n00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.810\nNow I'm simply gonna\nlaunch the web browser.\n\n310\n00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:26.771\nAnd in a moment,\nwe should connect into our RDS.\n\n311\n00:16:26.771 --> 00:16:29.603\nLet me go ahead and start typing this in.\n\n312\n00:16:29.603 --> 00:16:37.896\nhttps://rds.itprotvdemo.com, and\n\n313\n00:16:37.896 --> 00:16:40.363\nthen rdweb.\n\n314\n00:16:40.363 --> 00:16:42.455\nNotice I connect right away,\nwhich is good,\n\n315\n00:16:42.455 --> 00:16:44.280\ncuz that's exactly what we want to do.\n\n316\n00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.595\nIt looks like so far everything is good.\n\n317\n00:16:47.595 --> 00:16:48.865\nITProTV Demo.\n\n318\n00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.888\nAnd this at least tells us\nthat the web access server is\n\n319\n00:16:53.888 --> 00:16:56.139\nnow acting the way that it needs.\n\n320\n00:16:56.139 --> 00:16:59.816\nAnd if I typed in the password correctly,\nI should now sign in.\n\n321\n00:16:59.816 --> 00:17:01.100\nAnd there is our second step.\n\n322\n00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:05.852\nSo web access is performing, we're\nnoticing that round robin DNS is also on.\n\n323\n00:17:05.852 --> 00:17:08.890\nWe can see that of\ncourse by connecting in.\n\n324\n00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:12.940\nAnd if you're paying attention,\nin the lower left-hand corner, when it was\n\n325\n00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:17.370\nconnecting in, it happened to flash it\nreal fast, you might see the IP address.\n\n326\n00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:20.480\nAnd if you closed out and did it again,\nyou might see another IP address.\n\n327\n00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.642\nThat shows you that\nit's really working and\n\n328\n00:17:22.642 --> 00:17:24.521\nit is doing what it says it needs to do.\n\n329\n00:17:24.521 --> 00:17:29.908\nSo let's see if we can connect to our full\ndesktop where we made that collection.\n\n330\n00:17:29.908 --> 00:17:36.820\nSo I'm getting the connection,\nnow ITProTVdemo\\user01.\n\n331\n00:17:40.483 --> 00:17:42.083\nClick OK.\n\n332\n00:17:42.083 --> 00:17:45.110\nNow we just need to wait and\nverify that it's connecting.\n\n333\n00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:47.930\nNow, the first time it may take\njust a little bit of time before\n\n334\n00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:48.970\neverything connects.\n\n335\n00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.909\nIt says now configuring the remote\nsession, which is a good start,\n\n336\n00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:57.125\nbecause that says I am at least\ncommunicating with the actual gateway and\n\n337\n00:17:57.125 --> 00:17:58.664\neverything's working.\n\n338\n00:17:58.664 --> 00:18:01.185\nNow we of course have\nthis other certificate.\n\n339\n00:18:01.185 --> 00:18:03.724\nRemember that for me,\nI didn't enable that CRL.\n\n340\n00:18:03.724 --> 00:18:08.324\nBut the other thing is that on\nthis particular type of thin PC,\n\n341\n00:18:08.324 --> 00:18:10.280\nit's still not working.\n\n342\n00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.735\nIt doesn't give me access to\nthe registry to allow it to check.\n\n343\n00:18:13.735 --> 00:18:16.317\nSo I'm going to select,\nDo you wanna connect?\n\n344\n00:18:16.317 --> 00:18:18.432\nYes.\n\n345\n00:18:18.432 --> 00:18:20.135\nAnd, that looks actually good.\n\n346\n00:18:20.135 --> 00:18:23.524\nSo you can now see, now,\nnotice something different here, Cherokee.\n\n347\n00:18:23.524 --> 00:18:26.360\nLook at the very top connection bar.\n\n348\n00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.080\nSee if I can zoom in there.\n\n349\n00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.540\n&gt;&gt; The name of the server\nthat we're connecting to?\n\n350\n00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.170\n&gt;&gt; Yep, and now it actually does show-\n&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, it doesn't show\n\n351\n00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.300\nthe individual, it's just that name\nthat you had assigned it for both.\n\n352\n00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it shows that you're actually\nconnecting through something else, right?\n\n353\n00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:43.050\nSo instead of just RD1 or RD2, we are now\nconnecting just to something else.\n\n354\n00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:47.810\nSo it is at least, all signs from\nthe outside, from the user standpoint-\n\n355\n00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:48.550\n&gt;&gt; Appears to be going great.\n\n356\n00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.400\n&gt;&gt; Appears to be going great.\n\n357\n00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.907\nNow, appearances are always deceiving,\nbecause we don't really know.\n\n358\n00:18:53.907 --> 00:18:57.310\nSo the easiest thing for\nus to do is to go and verify.\n\n359\n00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:59.880\nLet me go back to the management\nserver where I was.\n\n360\n00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.527\nSo there were my notes said that\nyou saw right there, no big deal.\n\n361\n00:19:03.527 --> 00:19:06.180\nIt's from here I select Servers.\n\n362\n00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.913\nAnd then I can choose either one,\nI'm gonna choose RD01.\n\n363\n00:19:10.913 --> 00:19:14.540\nActually, I need to be on the other,\nI'm gonna get that same red error.\n\n364\n00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.707\nSo I know it's actually right here,\non RD01 go to, oops,\n\n365\n00:19:18.707 --> 00:19:21.589\nRemote Desktop Services, how's that?\n\n366\n00:19:21.589 --> 00:19:26.750\nServers, and then RD Gateway Manager.\n\n367\n00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.024\nNow, here's the moment of truth Cherokee.\n\n368\n00:19:28.024 --> 00:19:31.496\nWhen I click on the server, we're either\ngoing to get a big old goose egg or\n\n369\n00:19:31.496 --> 00:19:33.120\nwe're gonna get a one, okay.\n\n370\n00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.600\n&gt;&gt; We're number one.\n\n371\n00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.700\n&gt;&gt; And look at that now.\n\n372\n00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.000\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's see what happens.\n\n373\n00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.780\nNotice that says,\ntotal number of connections.\n\n374\n00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.900\nIt now sees that I'm using the gateway.\n\n375\n00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.110\nSo you've now proven at least\nin your test environment if\n\n376\n00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:47.060\nyou're getting this ready, right.\n\n377\n00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.054\nOne, that the remote gateway\nis actually responding,\n\n378\n00:19:50.054 --> 00:19:51.783\nwhich is the way that we want to.\n\n379\n00:19:51.783 --> 00:19:54.807\nThe other thing of course is that\nyou set it up correctly, and\n\n380\n00:19:54.807 --> 00:19:58.390\nnow you've proven that you can\nconnect through that gateway.\n\n381\n00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:59.460\nYou have the one.\n\n382\n00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:03.240\nIf I now click on the link that\nsays Monitor active connections,\n\n383\n00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:08.170\nI can now see in the active connections\nitself, the time it was connected on,\n\n384\n00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:14.060\nthe duration, and a little bit more\ndetails if I select right here.\n\n385\n00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.203\nI can even see the IP\naddress it connected into,\n\n386\n00:20:17.203 --> 00:20:20.983\nthe amount of data that's being sent and\nreceived here.\n\n387\n00:20:20.983 --> 00:20:21.523\nYou name it.\n\n388\n00:20:21.523 --> 00:20:26.064\nAnd the other thing that's really neat is\nyou're now in control of this session.\n\n389\n00:20:26.064 --> 00:20:29.268\nIf I want to, I can right-click on,\nlet me see which one.\n\n390\n00:20:29.268 --> 00:20:31.622\nI don't have to, I don't even\nhave to right-click, but I can.\n\n391\n00:20:31.622 --> 00:20:33.730\nBut I can right-click up here.\n\n392\n00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:37.839\nI can either disconnect the user,\nor even the connection.\n\n393\n00:20:37.839 --> 00:20:40.685\nWe have the same two options over\nhere on the right-hand side.\n\n394\n00:20:40.685 --> 00:20:45.286\nSo, in essence, Cherokee, everything\nthat we've been working towards,\n\n395\n00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:49.913\nif we think about it, as I switch on over\nto the machine and go to the overview.\n\n396\n00:20:49.913 --> 00:20:55.113\nAll of our roles except for one, okay,\nwhich is the licensing server, is now\n\n397\n00:20:55.113 --> 00:21:01.100\nhighly available in the very fact that we\nhave both of these machines tied to it.\n\n398\n00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:04.652\nSo now we have two web access,\ntwo remote gateways,\n\n399\n00:21:04.652 --> 00:21:08.867\ntwo connection broker services,\ntwo session host servers.\n\n400\n00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:13.240\nSo now you can continue to build\nupon that particular structure\n\n401\n00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.310\nto expand out if you need too.\n\n402\n00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:19.230\nAs your organization continues to grow,\nyou don't have to rebuild everything.\n\n403\n00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:23.320\nYou've got everything set in place, now\nyou're just adding in additional servers.\n\n404\n00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:27.040\nAnd from that point, as long as you\ncontinue to remember, hey, let me check\n\n405\n00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.550\nthat certificate every time I do that and\nmake sure it's using the same certificate.\n\n406\n00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:32.950\nYou should be up and going.\n\n407\n00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:37.330\nAnd that's exactly what we wanted to do,\nwas to make sure that somebody had a fully\n\n408\n00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:42.703\nconfigured, available at least cluster of\na sort here ready to go when you need it.\n\n409\n00:21:42.703 --> 00:21:45.541\n&gt;&gt; All right, Ronnie, thank you so\nmuch for guiding us through this journey.\n\n410\n00:21:45.541 --> 00:21:49.898\nIt's been quite a long path here, but\nwe were able to successfully install all\n\n411\n00:21:49.898 --> 00:21:52.869\nthe services needed to\nprovide high availability for\n\n412\n00:21:52.869 --> 00:21:54.797\nthis particular configuration.\n\n413\n00:21:54.797 --> 00:21:56.084\nSo thank you for that.\n\n414\n00:21:56.084 --> 00:21:58.579\nAnd thank you ladies and\ngentlemen for tuning in.\n\n415\n00:21:58.579 --> 00:22:00.225\nThat's about it for\nthis particular episode.\n\n416\n00:22:00.225 --> 00:22:02.836\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nsign off as your host Cherokee Boose.\n\n417\n00:22:02.836 --> 00:22:03.630\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n418\n00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:07.864\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at ITProTV.\n\n419\n00:22:07.864 --> 00:22:13.876\n[MUSIC]\n\n420\n00:22:13.876 --> 00:22:17.289\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
