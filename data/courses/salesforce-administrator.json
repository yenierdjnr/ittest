Great, thanks for having me.\n\n15\n00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:42.735\n&gt;&gt; Great to have you here and yeah, so\nFelicia tell me a little bit more about\n\n16\n00:00:42.735 --> 00:00:45.402\nwhat I can expect if I wanna sign up for\nthis exam?\n\n17\n00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:51.087\n&gt;&gt; Yup, and that's my goal here today is\nto teach everyone how to take the exam and\n\n18\n00:00:51.087 --> 00:00:52.218\npass the exam.\n\n19\n00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.825\n&gt;&gt; Yes, very important.\n\n20\n00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:55.011\n[LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So the who, the what,\n\n21\n00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:55.729\nthe when, the where.\n\n22\n00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:57.357\n[LAUGH] That's the objective for\ntoday, so.\n\n23\n00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:58.919\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, all right,\nso where do we start?\n\n24\n00:00:58.919 --> 00:01:03.050\nI guess the first thing we need to know is\nwho should be looking at taking this exam?\n\n25\n00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.631\n&gt;&gt; Right, and good question.\n\n26\n00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:06.520\nSo anyone who is a current\nSalesforce admin,\n\n27\n00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.070\nany consulting partners,\nanyone who wants to be a system admin.\n\n28\n00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.102\nI would say anyone with a broad\nknowledge of Salesforce.\n\n29\n00:01:14.102 --> 00:01:18.295\nTo start this is kind of your stepping\nstone into the certifications that\n\n30\n00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:19.816\nSalesforce has to offer.\n\n31\n00:01:19.816 --> 00:01:24.590\nSo there are no pre-requisites for\nthis exam itself.\n\n32\n00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.250\nBut if you want an advance\nthe longest administrative track,\n\n33\n00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.830\nthis is the first certification.\n\n34\n00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.976\nAnd the why, the benefits?\n\n35\n00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:36.941\nThere are few benefits aside from\nreceiving a badge that goes with it.\n\n36\n00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:38.659\nIt's a great resume builder, but\n\n37\n00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.277\nit definitely shows your\nknowledge of Salesforce.\n\n38\n00:01:41.277 --> 00:01:46.206\nCuz I will say anyone who has\nalready attempted to take the exam,\n\n39\n00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:47.945\nit is not an easy exam.\n\n40\n00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:49.522\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, and\n\n41\n00:01:49.522 --> 00:01:52.383\nthat's what I wanna kinda help\neveryone here prepare for it.\n\n42\n00:01:52.383 --> 00:01:55.221\nAnd anyone taking it for the first time,\n\n43\n00:01:55.221 --> 00:02:00.244\nI think it's important to know some\nthings to be ready to take the exam.\n\n44\n00:02:00.244 --> 00:02:05.943\nSo where, might be a good example or\ngood question.\n\n45\n00:02:05.943 --> 00:02:07.864\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The where?\n\n46\n00:02:07.864 --> 00:02:10.020\nThere's three different\nways to take the test.\n\n47\n00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.422\nSo one of them being\nan online proctored exam.\n\n48\n00:02:13.422 --> 00:02:15.834\nSo you can certainly take it from home,\nbut\n\n49\n00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:19.392\nthere are definitely some\nrequirements that Salesforce has.\n\n50\n00:02:19.392 --> 00:02:23.606\nSo they use the criterion\ncentennial software, so\n\n51\n00:02:23.606 --> 00:02:28.018\nyou cannot use my laptop,\nit's a built-in camera.\n\n52\n00:02:28.018 --> 00:02:31.730\nYou do need a web stand alone camera.\n\n53\n00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.720\nAnd with that, it needs at least\n12 inches of visibility, so\n\n54\n00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.550\nthey need to be able to see your keyboard,\nyour hands.\n\n55\n00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.838\nMake sure you do not have any\ndocumentation or material, no breaks.\n\n56\n00:02:43.838 --> 00:02:48.594\nIt is viewed, so that's another\nway to go ahead and take it, but\n\n57\n00:02:48.594 --> 00:02:52.486\nthere are some requirements\nto do it in that aspect.\n\n58\n00:02:52.486 --> 00:02:55.447\nAnd then the next one would\nbe of course going on site.\n\n59\n00:02:55.447 --> 00:02:59.712\nSo if you go to the website itself,\nthere's some options and places and\n\n60\n00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:04.280\nlocations nearby to take the test,\nmost of them are schools.\n\n61\n00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.032\nI would suggest to prepare and schedule\nit at least 24 to 72 hours before,\n\n62\n00:03:09.032 --> 00:03:12.410\nif this is something you're\nlooking to do right away.\n\n63\n00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.562\nBut that's another alternative\nthat's where I did it.\n\n64\n00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:19.201\nAnd you'll login to\nthe Salesforce website,\n\n65\n00:03:19.201 --> 00:03:24.809\nweb assessor to get started and\nget yourself prepared to take the test.\n\n66\n00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:28.067\nAnd then another option is\nSalesforce has a lot of events.\n\n67\n00:03:28.067 --> 00:03:32.322\nIf you've already been working in the\nsystem your familiar with Dreamforce or\n\n68\n00:03:32.322 --> 00:03:35.550\nthey have a lot of world tour or\nevents just to be certified.\n\n69\n00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.736\nThey do have some discounts there, but\n\n70\n00:03:37.736 --> 00:03:40.593\nthat's also another way in\nplace to take the test.\n\n71\n00:03:40.593 --> 00:03:45.486\nSo I would encourage to either do online\nproctored or through a school this way,\n\n72\n00:03:45.486 --> 00:03:49.149\nyou can get it done and\nnot have to wait for the annual event.\n\n73\n00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:51.556\nBut if it comes near time,\nI would wait around and\n\n74\n00:03:51.556 --> 00:03:53.508\nthen take advantage of any discounts.\n\n75\n00:03:53.508 --> 00:03:56.880\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we get a few different\nplaces we can look to take the exam.\n\n76\n00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.179\nFelicia, tell me a little bit\nmore about the exam itself.\n\n77\n00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:04.562\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so it is 60 multichoice questions,\nsome multiselect.\n\n78\n00:04:04.562 --> 00:04:07.728\nAnd you have 90 minutes to take the test.\n\n79\n00:04:07.728 --> 00:04:12.194\nYou need at least a 65%\nto pass the test and\n\n80\n00:04:12.194 --> 00:04:16.188\nyou need to maintain it when todo pass.\n\n81\n00:04:16.188 --> 00:04:20.630\nSo I wanna cover in this material,\nwhat some of those questions are.\n\n82\n00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.084\nUnfortunately, there are no exact\nSalesforce questions that you can just\n\n83\n00:04:25.084 --> 00:04:29.548\npull from and use, so there's no live\ncontent on the Salesforce website.\n\n84\n00:04:29.548 --> 00:04:33.016\nBut there are some places that host some\nof these test exam questions to kinda quiz\n\n85\n00:04:33.016 --> 00:04:33.533\nyourself.\n\n86\n00:04:33.533 --> 00:04:36.646\nAnd find out where you're strong\nin some areas and weak in others.\n\n87\n00:04:36.646 --> 00:04:41.317\nBut just fee cost, so registration\nis $200 and then to maintain or\n\n88\n00:04:41.317 --> 00:04:43.150\nretake test is a $100.\n\n89\n00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.591\nThere are discounts again like I mentioned\nduring Salesforce events like Dreamforce.\n\n90\n00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:51.478\nFor anyone who needs to use it\nin any different languages,\n\n91\n00:04:51.478 --> 00:04:54.901\nthey offer it in six\ndifferent languages options.\n\n92\n00:04:54.901 --> 00:04:57.458\n&gt;&gt; Very good, all right,\nthen once we take the exam,\n\n93\n00:04:57.458 --> 00:04:59.126\nlet's say we take it and pass it.\n\n94\n00:04:59.126 --> 00:05:00.991\nIs this a lifetime certification, or\n\n95\n00:05:00.991 --> 00:05:04.210\nis this something that we're gonna\nneed to re-up now and again?\n\n96\n00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.831\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's a great question.\n\n97\n00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:09.758\nSo you do need to maintain your\ncredentials and there are exams,\n\n98\n00:05:09.758 --> 00:05:14.090\nmaintenance exams that you need to take,\nit depends on the license.\n\n99\n00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.786\nFor this specific one or\ncredential that you're gonna be taking,\n\n100\n00:05:17.786 --> 00:05:21.625\nyou need to maintain and take three\nrelease exams on a year annually.\n\n101\n00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:26.213\nSo those exams, Salesforce is three\nreleases dates, they do in Spring,\n\n102\n00:05:26.213 --> 00:05:30.880\nSummer and Winter, and you have a time\nperiod to take those release exams.\n\n103\n00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.669\nIt's not as intensive as the normal\nintern exam, but there about five or\n\n104\n00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.431\nten multiple choice questions on those.\n\n105\n00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:43.606\nYou do need a passing of 30 minutes to\ncomplete and you're permitted 3 attempts.\n\n106\n00:05:43.606 --> 00:05:46.345\nAnd you can take it online,\nit's not proctored.\n\n107\n00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:48.067\nSo there's a little bit leniency there.\n\n108\n00:05:48.067 --> 00:05:48.795\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n109\n00:05:48.795 --> 00:05:51.121\n&gt;&gt; But\nyou do have to continue maintaining it.\n\n110\n00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:56.546\nOtherwise, you could suspend this license,\nyou may have to redo the whole process.\n\n111\n00:05:56.546 --> 00:05:59.311\nSo something you do wanna look out for\nand be aware of.\n\n112\n00:05:59.311 --> 00:06:02.612\n&gt;&gt; Definitely wanna avoid\nretaking the entire exam, right?\n\n113\n00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:03.203\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n114\n00:06:03.203 --> 00:06:04.343\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n115\n00:06:04.343 --> 00:06:05.063\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n116\n00:06:05.063 --> 00:06:09.581\n&gt;&gt; Right, so the exam itself then,\nhow do they break down the topics, or\n\n117\n00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:13.210\nwhat is it that they're looking for\non the exam?\n\n118\n00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.130\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so\nsomething that I teach a lot of people,\n\n119\n00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.252\nI think it's important to know the\nbreakdown and the percentage breakdown.\n\n120\n00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:21.337\nThis way you know Salesforce again is so\nrobust.\n\n121\n00:06:21.337 --> 00:06:26.210\nWhich areas you're strong in and\nwhich areas you're weak in?\n\n122\n00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.961\nAnd which areas to kind of\nsell you more in if it has-\n\n123\n00:06:27.961 --> 00:06:28.733\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n124\n00:06:28.733 --> 00:06:29.436\n&gt;&gt; A heavier weight on percentages.\n\n125\n00:06:29.436 --> 00:06:34.210\nSo I'll go through that outline and\nthis way you know, hey, I'm not so\n\n126\n00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.650\nstrong in this area.\n\n127\n00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.690\nLet me go back into this episode or\nthis content and kinda refresh and\n\n128\n00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:44.310\nsee what don't I know and\nwhat do I feel pretty confident in.\n\n129\n00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.168\nAnother kind of tip that I like\nto suggest when preparing and\n\n130\n00:06:48.168 --> 00:06:52.027\ntrying to take this test is go\nthrough some test scenarios or\n\n131\n00:06:52.027 --> 00:06:56.053\ntest questions and\nareas where you feel pretty confident on.\n\n132\n00:06:56.053 --> 00:07:00.023\nAgain go back to areas where you're\nweak and this is where you know,\n\n133\n00:07:00.023 --> 00:07:04.355\nlet's say if you're in something\nthat 18% standard custom objects.\n\n134\n00:07:04.355 --> 00:07:09.034\nIf you master that you've got 18% down\nthat your pretty, pretty confident on.\n\n135\n00:07:09.034 --> 00:07:11.839\nYou're about 100% sure you're\ngonna get 18% right, and\n\n136\n00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:13.460\nlet's jump to the next one you know.\n\n137\n00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.229\nSecurity access 15%, it's kinda tuck\nof bag, kind of work your way there.\n\n138\n00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:22.146\nSo I would like to go\nthrough a breakdown maybe.\n\n139\n00:07:22.146 --> 00:07:23.001\n&gt;&gt; Sure, that sounds great.\n\n140\n00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:28.082\n&gt;&gt; Great, yep, a very small,\nwe have a 1% WAN as an organization setup.\n\n141\n00:07:28.082 --> 00:07:31.068\nSo that includes\nthe company profile setup,\n\n142\n00:07:31.068 --> 00:07:35.390\nwhether you're setting up the fiscal year,\nthe company hours,\n\n143\n00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.647\ndefault settings,\ncurrency management, that's a 1% WAN.\n\n144\n00:07:39.647 --> 00:07:42.560\nThat's where most of the company\nprofile information is held.\n\n145\n00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.310\nNext after that, you have the user setup.\n\n146\n00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:50.679\nSo as a system admin, this is where\ndeactivating users, creating users.\n\n147\n00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:55.587\nA most common scenario is that you kind\nof do in your every day work to work as\n\n148\n00:07:55.587 --> 00:07:56.703\na system admin.\n\n149\n00:07:56.703 --> 00:08:01.433\nAgain 9%,\nwait on the exam questions itself.\n\n150\n00:08:01.433 --> 00:08:05.626\nSo resolving lock accounts,\nresetting passwords, and\n\n151\n00:08:05.626 --> 00:08:08.517\nall this out covering in our episodes.\n\n152\n00:08:08.517 --> 00:08:12.894\nNext, again smaller presentage,\nglobal settings, so\n\n153\n00:08:12.894 --> 00:08:19.198\nconfiguring page layouts, the UI, user\ninterface look and feel of Salesforce.\n\n154\n00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:22.753\nList views, knowing just some of\nthose basic definitions that you use\n\n155\n00:08:22.753 --> 00:08:24.028\nin your every day setup.\n\n156\n00:08:24.028 --> 00:08:27.712\nBut heavier weights, so security.\n\n157\n00:08:27.712 --> 00:08:31.795\nSecurity is a big part in Salesforce,\nit takes up to 15%\n\n158\n00:08:31.795 --> 00:08:32.515\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n159\n00:08:32.515 --> 00:08:34.298\n&gt;&gt; Of the total weight of the questions.\n\n160\n00:08:34.298 --> 00:08:40.549\nSo you really do wanna know the security\nsetup, not just for the exam itself.\n\n161\n00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:45.189\nBut it's really the base of Salesforce and\nwhat you can do in the system.\n\n162\n00:08:45.189 --> 00:08:49.446\nAnd then next, what you utilize within?\n\n163\n00:08:49.446 --> 00:08:54.216\nSo the core Salesforce, your standard and\ncustom objects, your accounts, contacts,\n\n164\n00:08:54.216 --> 00:08:55.890\nopportunities.\n\n165\n00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.894\nThis plays the largest\nchunk into the exam, 19%.\n\n166\n00:08:59.894 --> 00:09:00.477\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n167\n00:09:00.477 --> 00:09:02.872\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, 18%.\n\n168\n00:09:02.872 --> 00:09:05.721\n[LAUGH] So you wanna make sure\nyou know your standard and\n\n169\n00:09:05.721 --> 00:09:08.008\ncustom objects, you know your security.\n\n170\n00:09:08.008 --> 00:09:11.875\nYou can kind of do the math there,\nyou got that,\n\n171\n00:09:11.875 --> 00:09:18.120\nyou have a pretty good chunk of\npassing with your certification.\n\n172\n00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.490\nAnd then next, you go down to sales and\nmarketing applications.\n\n173\n00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:27.040\nSo within the exam itself,\nyou're covering the sales cloud and\n\n174\n00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.610\nthe marketing cloud, and some of\nthe community cloud aspects into the exam.\n\n175\n00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.844\nSo this is gonna cover any of\nthe set up with the marketing\n\n176\n00:09:35.844 --> 00:09:40.262\napplications opportunities,\nproducts, price books,\n\n177\n00:09:40.262 --> 00:09:46.230\nall those related questions will sit\nwithin this kind of weight of questions.\n\n178\n00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.950\nAnd then the next,\nyou would have service and support.\n\n179\n00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:53.603\nSo case management, case questions,\nsupports related information,\n\n180\n00:09:53.603 --> 00:09:55.061\nthat's 6% weight.\n\n181\n00:09:55.061 --> 00:09:58.557\nAnd then some of the other\nsmaller ones that's so good\n\n182\n00:09:58.557 --> 00:10:01.801\nto know because it can end up, would be-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n183\n00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:04.998\n&gt;&gt; Activity management, chatter,\n\n184\n00:10:04.998 --> 00:10:09.848\ndata management, content and\nfolder management,\n\n185\n00:10:09.848 --> 00:10:13.630\nand desktop and mobile counts for 2%.\n\n186\n00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:18.578\nSomewhere in this larger chunk would be\nworkflow automation which is about 7%.\n\n187\n00:10:18.578 --> 00:10:22.049\nAnd I think that covers that all.\n\n188\n00:10:22.049 --> 00:10:23.577\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n189\n00:10:23.577 --> 00:10:24.915\n&gt;&gt; It could really dissected that.\n\n190\n00:10:24.915 --> 00:10:26.249\n&gt;&gt; Very good, very good,\n\n191\n00:10:26.249 --> 00:10:29.869\nit really does give us a good way\nkind of focus our study, right?\n\n192\n00:10:29.869 --> 00:10:33.080\nWe wanna know it all,\nwe wanna be able to pass the exam.\n\n193\n00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.286\nBut Azure studying it really helps\nto know, how much I should spend or\n\n194\n00:10:37.286 --> 00:10:40.201\nfocus on this versus one\nof those other topics.\n\n195\n00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:43.743\nSo we thank you for that, what about\nany other preparation materials?\n\n196\n00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:48.294\nI know these episodes here at ITPro.TV\nare obviously gonna help me pass the exam.\n\n197\n00:10:48.294 --> 00:10:50.213\nIs there anything else I can\ndo to get ready for this?\n\n198\n00:10:50.213 --> 00:10:54.409\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean I would look at I don't\nhave any specific one to recommend, but\n\n199\n00:10:54.409 --> 00:10:57.504\nI would look online through\nsome small practice exams.\n\n200\n00:10:57.504 --> 00:11:02.275\nAgain the questions, especially\nthe multiselect, they're pretty tricky.\n\n201\n00:11:02.275 --> 00:11:04.518\nAnd I would quiz yourself and\n\n202\n00:11:04.518 --> 00:11:10.070\nfind there's a lot of places to go\nto kinda pull from those exams.\n\n203\n00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.005\nAnd use information that you got wrong\nto kind of go read back and look and\n\n204\n00:11:14.005 --> 00:11:16.707\nsee I thought it was\nsupposed to be this way.\n\n205\n00:11:16.707 --> 00:11:21.663\nBut there's a small error in\nthe way they phrase their questions\n\n206\n00:11:21.663 --> 00:11:23.694\ncan kind of throw you off.\n\n207\n00:11:23.694 --> 00:11:28.555\nAnd I've talked with people who've\nbeen Salesforce admins for five,\n\n208\n00:11:28.555 --> 00:11:33.510\nten years and they took the test,\ndidn't prepare, didn't question.\n\n209\n00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.989\nThey thought they had it in the bag and\nthey failed.\n\n210\n00:11:35.989 --> 00:11:39.982\nI mean Salesforce is so robust,\nit's those small little things,\n\n211\n00:11:39.982 --> 00:11:42.416\nit's the way they phrase the question.\n\n212\n00:11:42.416 --> 00:11:46.790\nIt's the multiselect options that\nyou think you know something.\n\n213\n00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.320\nOr even the updates like I said,\n\n214\n00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.906\nthey did the three releases where those\nanswers change and things change.\n\n215\n00:11:51.906 --> 00:11:56.840\nAnd if you're not up to date or\nyou don't prepare enough,\n\n216\n00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.165\nyou're gonna lose out those points and\n\n217\n00:12:00.165 --> 00:12:04.107\nno one wants to pay to\nhave to take a retake fee.\n\n218\n00:12:04.107 --> 00:12:04.646\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n219\n00:12:04.646 --> 00:12:05.957\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yep, so yes,\n\n220\n00:12:05.957 --> 00:12:07.764\nmy thing would be to go back,\nreflect, look.\n\n221\n00:12:07.764 --> 00:12:10.766\nAnd another thing that I would suggest and\n\n222\n00:12:10.766 --> 00:12:16.786\nwhich I would like to show you on this how\nto navigate within Salesforce Trailhead.\n\n223\n00:12:16.786 --> 00:12:22.640\nAnd then let's go to my screen and I'll\nkinda show you where within Salesforce.\n\n224\n00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.617\nSo if you're logged in already and\nyou go to Setup.\n\n225\n00:12:25.617 --> 00:12:28.690\nIf you're still kinda\nlearning the system and\n\n226\n00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:33.022\nmaybe you don't have as enough\nknowledge as you thought you had,\n\n227\n00:12:33.022 --> 00:12:36.426\nyou can see here right here\nis View Free Tutorials.\n\n228\n00:12:36.426 --> 00:12:39.127\nBut the Trailhead is more interactive.\n\n229\n00:12:39.127 --> 00:12:41.453\nActually I'm sorry, I'm gonna go to Help.\n\n230\n00:12:41.453 --> 00:12:45.779\nAnd for some reason Help is always\nthe page that takes the longest to load.\n\n231\n00:12:45.779 --> 00:12:48.553\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] In salesforce it really is, and\n\n232\n00:12:48.553 --> 00:12:49.491\nas it loads here.\n\n233\n00:12:49.491 --> 00:12:52.646\nYou have a few options which are covered\nlater in the demo as far as helping.\n\n234\n00:12:52.646 --> 00:12:57.894\nBut success community is great now\nthat I see it here, to get answers and\n\n235\n00:12:57.894 --> 00:13:03.857\ntalk to other users and maybe tips, aside\nfrom what I'll kind of give you today.\n\n236\n00:13:03.857 --> 00:13:07.919\n[LAUGH] But right over here to\nTrailhead is where you wanna go, and\n\n237\n00:13:07.919 --> 00:13:11.769\nit's a guided learning path to\ndoing things in Salesforce.\n\n238\n00:13:11.769 --> 00:13:14.818\nSo if you weren't strong\nin work flow automation and\n\n239\n00:13:14.818 --> 00:13:16.911\nyou wanna do some practice things.\n\n240\n00:13:16.911 --> 00:13:21.920\nThey'll have you set up a developer\naccount and that is what I'm in right now.\n\n241\n00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:29.720\nAnd this gives you, it's free full force\nlicense access to do all of these things.\n\n242\n00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.880\nEven data loads, you create accounts and\ncontacts, play around with it.\n\n243\n00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:39.410\nThis is your test org here, and\nTrailhead works together with it.\n\n244\n00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:43.740\nAnd they give you Trailhead badges and\nI know some Salesforce account executives\n\n245\n00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.900\nwho add those badges to\ntheir LinkedIn profile.\n\n246\n00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.980\nSo it's something fun to collect too,\nand they make it interactive.\n\n247\n00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:55.842\nBut it's also a great way to do\nit yourself and figure out, hey,\n\n248\n00:13:55.842 --> 00:13:59.368\nI couldn't do it because\nI missed a step here.\n\n249\n00:13:59.368 --> 00:14:02.774\nSo I would take advantage of\nusing the Trailhead, it's free.\n\n250\n00:14:02.774 --> 00:14:08.066\nGetting a developer addition to do\nthe steps itself is the way you\n\n251\n00:14:08.066 --> 00:14:13.075\nknow what kinda small little\nerror you're making in setup.\n\n252\n00:14:13.075 --> 00:14:15.038\nSo those are my recommendations.\n\n253\n00:14:15.038 --> 00:14:17.410\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.811\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPROTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.050\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n5\n00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.590\nWelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITPROTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.660\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\n\n7\n00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.500\ntoday we're doing our\nSalesforce Certified Administrator.\n\n8\n00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.210\nAnd particularly in this episode,\nwe're gonna be focusing in on\n\n9\n00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.370\norganization set up and\nworking with your company profile.\n\n10\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.050\nAnd here to help us with that is Ms.\nFelicia Duarte.\n\n11\n00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.630\nHow are you doing Felicia?\n\n12\n00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.510\n&gt;&gt; Good.\nHow are you doing?\n\n13\n00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.480\n&gt;&gt; Doing great.\nThanks.\n\n14\n00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.790\n&gt;&gt; Great.\nYep, so today I'd like to cover and\n\n15\n00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.775\nstart out with organization setup and\ncompany profile information Information.\n\n16\n00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:44.345\nSo this is great for\nthose system admins who are getting\n\n17\n00:00:44.345 --> 00:00:48.555\njust started with Salesforce licenses,\ngetting the organization set up.\n\n18\n00:00:48.555 --> 00:00:50.885\nIt's often used if you\nneed to make changes.\n\n19\n00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:51.825\nYou need to know where to go,\n\n20\n00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:55.720\nwhere to navigate and\nto make these org-wide changes.\n\n21\n00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.470\nSo I'm gonna kinda show you where to make\nthose changes, what they're used for.\n\n22\n00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.740\nIt only covers for 1% out of the questions\nfor your Salesforce exam, but\n\n23\n00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.800\nit's still good to know so\nyou don't, every question counts.\n\n24\n00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.253\nSo you don't get those wrong.\n\n25\n00:01:08.253 --> 00:01:08.920\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n26\n00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.850\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nbank a few of them there if we can.\n\n27\n00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I agree.\n\n28\n00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.730\nSo I'm gonna show on my screen\nwhere to navigate to make those\n\n29\n00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:16.930\nchanges to start out.\n\n30\n00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.750\nIt can be a little tricky, especially if\nit's your first time navigating on to\n\n31\n00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.470\nthe subsection, but\nyou have two search bars in Salesforce.\n\n32\n00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.420\nSo if I hit set up, you're gonna wanna\ndo all your searching as admin if\n\n33\n00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.990\nnot already familiar within\nthis quick find search here.\n\n34\n00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.859\nSo I'm just gonna search company profile,\nand it's gonna take\n\n35\n00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:40.830\nme over to this section over here\nwhich is mostly used for admins.\n\n36\n00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.417\nSo I'm gonna come over here, again only\nthose with system admin rights have\n\n37\n00:01:46.417 --> 00:01:52.286\naccess to see this search and setup area,\nwhich is why we're taking this exam.\n\n38\n00:01:52.286 --> 00:01:57.750\n[LAUGH] So we're gonna go ahead and\ngo into the edit feature.\n\n39\n00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.970\nJust so I can show you at this point right\nhere what kinda changes can you make here?\n\n40\n00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.880\nAnd it's pretty much laid out here for\nyou.\n\n41\n00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.600\nSo basic, if you wanna make\nchanges to your organization name.\n\n42\n00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.170\nAny time there's a case that you\nneed to log with Salesforce.\n\n43\n00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.590\nWho's a primary contact?\n\n44\n00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.230\nSo that's right now,\nI'm the user, Felicia Duarte.\n\n45\n00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.780\nThis is a look up and\nit's gonna show who to contact if\n\n46\n00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.760\nthere's any changes that need\nto be made within Salesforce.\n\n47\n00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.710\nSo enter your contact information there,\naddress,\n\n48\n00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.660\nwhat's the address for the company,\nthe organization as a whole?\n\n49\n00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.890\nYou can have this here,\nI'll cover further,\n\n50\n00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.020\nas far as locale settings\ngo to the individual level,\n\n51\n00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.620\nbecause maybe you have the org and\nyour setup in multiple locations.\n\n52\n00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.120\nWhat's the time zone setting there?\n\n53\n00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.810\nHow do I make those preferences?\n\n54\n00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.000\nRight now, I'm strictly talking\nabout the org as a whole.\n\n55\n00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.590\nSo what's the default?\n\n56\n00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.840\nEnglish, for us right now, US.\n\n57\n00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.890\nWe're gonna keep it with English\nas the default language.\n\n58\n00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.350\nI, myself am from Los Angeles, I'm gonna\nkeep it with Pacific Standard time.\n\n59\n00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.220\nBut I will show you options,\nyou have every single option here,\n\n60\n00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.360\nto change any default\nsettings that you need to.\n\n61\n00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.520\nSo, I'm gonna go down\nto currency settings.\n\n62\n00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.908\nNow, you can keep if you\nare using just one currency.\n\n63\n00:03:18.908 --> 00:03:22.367\nSo most companies just use\nthe standard US currency, but\n\n64\n00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:27.260\nmaybe you are using it and you need\nto keep track of multiple currencies.\n\n65\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.470\nThis affects any currency field,\nand throughout the Salesforce org,\n\n66\n00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.290\nso if you need to establish\nmultiple currencies,\n\n67\n00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.680\nyou're gonna need to log\nin a case with Salesforce.\n\n68\n00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.930\nThey're gonna need to enable it for you.\n\n69\n00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.000\nBut, part of those first prompts that they\ngive you to setting that up, is they're\n\n70\n00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.880\ngonna ask you to select the allow\nsupport to activate multiple currencies.\n\n71\n00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.160\nWe'll get into how to log a case, and\n\n72\n00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.610\nwhat information you're gonna\nbe asked to be provided.\n\n73\n00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.131\nBut just know that when you do need to\nenable it for any of your orgs that you're\n\n74\n00:03:59.131 --> 00:04:02.343\nsetting up, you need to make sure\nyou're gonna check this box first.\n\n75\n00:04:02.343 --> 00:04:07.771\nAnd if you highlight over this little i,\nit'll kinda give you more details\n\n76\n00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:12.768\nthere but this is just that first step\nto the process to enabling it and\n\n77\n00:04:12.768 --> 00:04:15.888\nright now we won't see all those options.\n\n78\n00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:20.716\nBut you'll have the options as far as\nwhat currencies, the conversion rates and\n\n79\n00:04:20.716 --> 00:04:24.906\neverything, and all of that's gonna\nbe tied into this section here.\n\n80\n00:04:24.906 --> 00:04:28.464\nSo again we're right up over\ninto the company information.\n\n81\n00:04:28.464 --> 00:04:31.776\nSo again,\nthis is also the place if you wanna check,\n\n82\n00:04:31.776 --> 00:04:36.660\nif you wanna receive any Salesforce\nnewsletters to be sent to you.\n\n83\n00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.260\nYou can see here it's pretty\nstraightforward, log in notifications.\n\n84\n00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.480\nThis is just your place to handle that and\ntake care of it.\n\n85\n00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.750\nBut the company profile Is\nbroken down into five sections.\n\n86\n00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.740\nSo company information,\nat this point right here,\n\n87\n00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.030\nas you're getting started,\nthis is what you have available to edit.\n\n88\n00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.500\nBut I'm gonna take a step back.\n\n89\n00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.900\nI don't need to make changes let's say.\n\n90\n00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.170\nYou can see all this information here,\nbut to your\n\n91\n00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.450\nright you have more availability as far as\nwhat you have access to, to see and do.\n\n92\n00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.160\nSo as a system admin your role is often\n\n93\n00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.450\nto set up users,\nattach licenses to these users.\n\n94\n00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.510\nBut you need to know your license count.\n\n95\n00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.550\nYou need to know your data.\n\n96\n00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.264\nOnce you've maybe set up and\nthen some historical data imports,\n\n97\n00:05:29.264 --> 00:05:31.153\nonce you have a lot going in here,\n\n98\n00:05:31.153 --> 00:05:34.950\nI've worked with a lot of accounts\nthat have reached their limit.\n\n99\n00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.650\nAnd they didn't even\nknow they had a limit.\n\n100\n00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.360\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n101\n00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I mean, this is the spot to go and\n\n102\n00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.770\nkeep track of, maybe initially\nhow much data do I wanna push in?\n\n103\n00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.860\nAre you really looking\nto bring on an org and\n\n104\n00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.330\npush in three years of historical data?\n\n105\n00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.730\nFive years, and\nthen you're reaching that data limit.\n\n106\n00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:57.125\nAnd this will show you that space that you\nhave available as you're bringing in and\n\n107\n00:05:57.125 --> 00:06:00.755\npushing in data or kind of working\nthroughout the years within Salesforce.\n\n108\n00:06:02.065 --> 00:06:07.645\nAnd to that point if you do wanna keep all\nthat information, all that data I'd like\n\n109\n00:06:07.645 --> 00:06:13.455\nto kinda go through what the data consists\nof, what's counted, what's not counted.\n\n110\n00:06:13.455 --> 00:06:19.270\nAnd where to go when you need to\npurchase more data space and file space.\n\n111\n00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.468\nBut we'll get into that in a bit.\n\n112\n00:06:20.468 --> 00:06:24.330\nI just kinda wanna show you here\nwhat are your options at this\n\n113\n00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.690\norganization detail section.\n\n114\n00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.530\nSo API request.\n\n115\n00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.070\nYou have a limitation as far as\nhow many calls you can make.\n\n116\n00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.870\nThis is based off your license type.\n\n117\n00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:42.450\nSo if you have a Professional Edition,\nDeveloper Edition and Enterprise Edition,\n\n118\n00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:48.610\nyou're able to make about 15,000\ncalls per 24-hour period.\n\n119\n00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.580\nYou have a Performance Edition that\ngoes up to 15,000 calls you can\n\n120\n00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:59.370\nmake within that 24-hour period, so it\ndepends on the license type that you have.\n\n121\n00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.090\nI will say there are exceptions at\n\n122\n00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.480\nSalesforce we've had to\nmake [LAUGH] before.\n\n123\n00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.660\nBut you can log a case\nwhere they can enable,\n\n124\n00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.640\nI believe it's up to a week,\nif you need to make additional calls.\n\n125\n00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.040\nLet's say you're pushing\nin historical data,\n\n126\n00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.800\nI'll show you where to log a case and make\nthose changes and requests to Salesforce.\n\n127\n00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.760\n&gt;&gt; So where you might not\nnormally have that many, but\n\n128\n00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.740\nyou get this peak period where\nyou're bringing in all the data.\n\n129\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.540\nYou need a few extras\njust to finish that up?\n\n130\n00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that usually, for\nmost orgs happens early on,\n\n131\n00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.165\nwhen you're pushing in all that historical\ndata or you're doing an update.\n\n132\n00:07:33.165 --> 00:07:38.520\nAnd retail counts, so you need them\nboth up to date data right away.\n\n133\n00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.307\nYou kinda need to make those extra calls,\nespecially if you're\n\n134\n00:07:43.307 --> 00:07:47.750\nusing third-party apps,\nlike Jitterbit to push in data.\n\n135\n00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.707\nThere's only so many you can make at\na time that you need to log a case and\n\n136\n00:07:52.707 --> 00:07:54.658\nenable more temporarily.\n\n137\n00:07:54.658 --> 00:07:56.727\nAnd that's without a cost but\n\n138\n00:07:56.727 --> 00:08:01.126\nyou can also purchase more if\nyou need something more ongoing.\n\n139\n00:08:01.126 --> 00:08:07.160\nSo this is also the place to show you\nrestricted logins, current month.\n\n140\n00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.288\nAnd then your Salesforce org ID.\n\n141\n00:08:09.288 --> 00:08:11.982\nSo any time you're asked,\nwhich you will be asked,\n\n142\n00:08:11.982 --> 00:08:17.332\nany time you're looking to bring on\na new app, they'll ask for your org ID.\n\n143\n00:08:17.332 --> 00:08:20.960\nAny time you're looking to log a case\nthey're gonna ask you for your org ID.\n\n144\n00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:26.640\nThis is the best place to find it here,\nif not the only place in Salesforce.\n\n145\n00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.958\nAnd then what edition are you on?\n\n146\n00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:32.560\nSo right now I'm in a free\ndeveloper edition account.\n\n147\n00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.770\nBut are you in professional?\n\n148\n00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.650\nIs your org in enterprise?\n\n149\n00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.610\nAnd that's something I like to find\nout early on, as I'm setting up and\n\n150\n00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.772\nimplementing because each one has its\nown restrictions on what you can do.\n\n151\n00:08:44.772 --> 00:08:49.613\nSo as a system admin, and you're making\nrecommendations out to your users,\n\n152\n00:08:49.613 --> 00:08:53.858\nyou wanna be able to provide\nthe recommendations within the reach of\n\n153\n00:08:53.858 --> 00:08:54.990\nwhat they can do.\n\n154\n00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.410\nYou don't wanna suggest something that\n\n155\n00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:00.430\nthey can't do because of\nthe limitation of their edition.\n\n156\n00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:05.668\nSo I go here first and if I am taking\n\n157\n00:09:05.668 --> 00:09:11.170\nonboard a new account, a new org,\nstart at your company information.\n\n158\n00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:15.300\nSee how much data space is available,\nsee how much file space is available.\n\n159\n00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.630\nSee the org type that they have,\nand kinda start here.\n\n160\n00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.130\nAnd know the licenses that they have.\n\n161\n00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:25.115\nBecause this is something that they\npurchase from the beginning from their\n\n162\n00:09:25.115 --> 00:09:28.310\nSalesforce account when they decided to,\nif it hasn't changed,\n\n163\n00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.160\nwhen they decided what\nlicenses to go with.\n\n164\n00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:37.610\nSo sometimes some orgs just have,\nmost orgs just have a Salesforce license.\n\n165\n00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.555\nBut maybe some have a force.com license.\n\n166\n00:09:41.555 --> 00:09:45.810\nI'll cover those, but\nright now we're in the developer account.\n\n167\n00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.930\nSo it's not gonna show all\nthe different types of licenses.\n\n168\n00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:52.190\nBut I'll go through some of the most\ncommon ones that I've come across and\n\n169\n00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.320\nthat I've seen.\n\n170\n00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.542\nSo this way, when you're looking at\nthe list of licenses that an org may have,\n\n171\n00:09:57.542 --> 00:09:59.420\nyou know what they do.\n\n172\n00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.700\nSo Salesforce is the most standard.\n\n173\n00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:09.940\nThis is your license which you have\naccess to set up basic CRM functionality,\n\n174\n00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:16.000\nstandard and custom objects, being your\nleads, accounts, contacts, opportunities.\n\n175\n00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.220\nEverything you see up here and more.\n\n176\n00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.070\nThere's more hidden below\nwithin the tabs here.\n\n177\n00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:28.850\nSo that's your standard Salesforce,\nwhich most users will have access to.\n\n178\n00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.340\nBut then you have your\nSalesforce platform.\n\n179\n00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.014\nAnd so your Salesforce,\nit does not need access to the full CRM.\n\n180\n00:10:36.014 --> 00:10:39.864\nSo a Salesforce platform user does\nnot have access to the leads and\n\n181\n00:10:39.864 --> 00:10:40.919\nopportunities.\n\n182\n00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:46.640\nJust has basic access to accounts and\ncontacts and some other objects.\n\n183\n00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.630\nSo there's a difference there as far as\nthe Salesforce and Salesforce platform.\n\n184\n00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:55.950\nSo no access to leads or opportunities,\nbut accounts and contacts.\n\n185\n00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.947\nAnother common one would be\nthe force.com license that you'll see.\n\n186\n00:11:02.947 --> 00:11:06.656\nAnd this is what the platform\nthat Salesforce is built on, so\n\n187\n00:11:06.656 --> 00:11:08.870\nyou can build from yourself there.\n\n188\n00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.830\nSo if you wanna bring in,\nif you have a force.com app license,\n\n189\n00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.970\nthat's only restricted to\nthe apps that you bring in.\n\n190\n00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.222\nYou kinda get the gist as far\nas Salesforce is the standard\n\n191\n00:11:19.222 --> 00:11:19.947\none-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n192\n00:11:19.947 --> 00:11:23.090\n&gt;&gt; That you wanna use out the door.\n\n193\n00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:26.110\nThat gives you all those basic CRM\n\n194\n00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:27.850\nfunctionality that you're looking for\nin a CRM.\n\n195\n00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.890\n&gt;&gt; And\nthen if I needed additional functionality,\n\n196\n00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.300\nI would just have to get\nthose additional licenses.\n\n197\n00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n198\n00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.960\nAnd this right here, great question,\nshows you your license count.\n\n199\n00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:44.170\nSo I can see these are my\nactive licenses right now, and\n\n200\n00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.460\nthis is how much I have available.\n\n201\n00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.810\nSo whether you have ten licenses.\n\n202\n00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:53.280\nThis is kinda a good place to show you\nwhat you can use when adding new users.\n\n203\n00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.507\nSo I've had a lot of clients comment,\nthey try to bring ten licenses and\n\n204\n00:11:57.507 --> 00:12:00.410\nthey're adding users and\nthen they're stuck.\n\n205\n00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:04.190\nAnd they don't know how\nto create more licenses.\n\n206\n00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.483\nAnd then we go here, it always defaults\nback to, hey, you're out of licenses.\n\n207\n00:12:07.483 --> 00:12:10.000\n&gt;&gt; All right, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or there's a user that they don't\n\n208\n00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.020\neven know that hasn't logged in or\nhasn't been with the company.\n\n209\n00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.935\nSo that's a license that\nyou can deactivate and\n\n210\n00:12:16.935 --> 00:12:18.310\nkinda open up a license there.\n\n211\n00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.938\nSo I think a good role of\na system admin is knowing\n\n212\n00:12:22.938 --> 00:12:28.630\nwhat's being used within the system,\nknowing what's remaining.\n\n213\n00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.880\nThis way you can provide\nthe best recommendations when you\n\n214\n00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.310\ndo need to purchase more.\n\n215\n00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.210\nSo everything here is straightforward.\n\n216\n00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:41.860\nYou have your basic user\nlicenses which we went over.\n\n217\n00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.700\nBut there are also different\nsets of licenses which can be\n\n218\n00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.950\npermission set licenses.\n\n219\n00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:51.387\nLater in these episodes we'll\ngo over permission sets and\n\n220\n00:12:51.387 --> 00:12:53.910\nsharing rules and all that [LAUGH].\n\n221\n00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:59.110\nBut you can also have permissions set\nlicenses, which will give you additional\n\n222\n00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:04.370\nfeatures outside the standard\nSalesforce license.\n\n223\n00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.770\nAnd then feature licenses.\n\n224\n00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.374\nSo with that you can have a, so\n\n225\n00:13:08.374 --> 00:13:13.120\nwith Salesforce you can only have one\nuser license, so one Salesforce license.\n\n226\n00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.730\nBut you can also have feature licenses\nwhich kinda build on top of that.\n\n227\n00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:20.230\nSo maybe you also are a marketing user or\n\n228\n00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:24.610\nan offline user or a data.com user.\n\n229\n00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.510\nThese licenses you purchase and\nthey're available and\n\n230\n00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.530\nthey kinda sit on top of your other users.\n\n231\n00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:34.410\nAnd you'll have those options which\nwe'll cover later in the user setup\n\n232\n00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.501\non where to kinda add those in.\n\n233\n00:13:39.039 --> 00:13:42.030\nSo I'm gonna scroll to the top, and\n\n234\n00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:47.130\nthere's two different types of\nways the data is contained.\n\n235\n00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.550\nSo it's either split up between\nthe data space and file space.\n\n236\n00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:55.575\nI click into either one of these, I'm\ngonna be taken to the same page [LAUGH].\n\n237\n00:13:55.575 --> 00:13:59.600\nSo the storage available is\ndata storage and file storage.\n\n238\n00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:06.440\nWith more retail companies we definitely\nsee opportunities being used a lot.\n\n239\n00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:12.252\nBut one thing to note is opportunity line\nitems do not count towards data storage.\n\n240\n00:14:12.252 --> 00:14:16.300\nSo the opportunity itself does count.\n\n241\n00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.420\nAnd then most of the time\nI noticed task counts\n\n242\n00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.200\nare considered part of the data storage.\n\n243\n00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.230\nBut then file storage, so\nthe content within it and\n\n244\n00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:31.038\nthe photos,\nthey kinda fall in their own file storage.\n\n245\n00:14:31.038 --> 00:14:35.490\nSo I see here, you can see the record\ncount, so each individual record and\n\n246\n00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:37.140\nthen the storage and the amount.\n\n247\n00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:42.680\nAnd you can see here what you\nhave available left to use.\n\n248\n00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:43.855\n&gt;&gt; It's a really nice dashboard.\n\n249\n00:14:43.855 --> 00:14:46.700\nMakes it easy to get in there and\nsee exactly what you've got.\n\n250\n00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah it does, and\nit's laid our for you so\n\n251\n00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:55.370\nit's easy to kinda find and know and\nit doesn't make it difficult at all.\n\n252\n00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.020\nAnd with that so you see it's taking\nme over so I'm in storage unit.\n\n253\n00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.375\nSo now I'm in the data management section\nwhich is something we'll cover on a little\n\n254\n00:15:02.375 --> 00:15:03.330\nbit later on.\n\n255\n00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:08.182\nBut I'm just gonna navigate back to\nthe company profile information.\n\n256\n00:15:08.182 --> 00:15:13.432\nSo now you know where to go when\nyou need to know your used data\n\n257\n00:15:13.432 --> 00:15:18.582\nspace storage and file storage and\nwhere all of that sits.\n\n258\n00:15:18.582 --> 00:15:23.920\nBut there are four other places\nthat the company information holds.\n\n259\n00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.968\nSo let's go into fiscal year.\n\n260\n00:15:31.229 --> 00:15:35.907\nSo if you're onboarding or\ngetting a new org setup,\n\n261\n00:15:35.907 --> 00:15:39.000\nyou keep track of the fiscal year.\n\n262\n00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.510\nThis is part of forecasting and reports.\n\n263\n00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:45.370\nSo if you have a standard fiscal year,\nit's pretty straightforward.\n\n264\n00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.010\nYou'd get them set up on\nthe start month of the year.\n\n265\n00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:49.663\nAnd then if it starts at the end or\n\n266\n00:15:49.663 --> 00:15:52.866\nthe beginning of the month that\nthis fiscal year is based off.\n\n267\n00:15:52.866 --> 00:15:55.858\nBut if you do have something\na little bit more complex,\n\n268\n00:15:55.858 --> 00:15:59.642\na little bit more formula-based,\nyou can customize a fiscal year.\n\n269\n00:15:59.642 --> 00:16:01.151\nThere are some implications.\n\n270\n00:16:01.151 --> 00:16:03.624\nIn that you can't revert back.\n\n271\n00:16:03.624 --> 00:16:05.493\nBut if you needed to revert back.\n\n272\n00:16:05.493 --> 00:16:10.382\n[LAUGH] You can revert it back to\nlike a standard custom fiscal year.\n\n273\n00:16:10.382 --> 00:16:14.870\nBut let's use this example\nthat Salesforce gives.\n\n274\n00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:21.180\nMaybe you have a fiscal year that needs\nfour equal quarters in period of 4 to 4.5.\n\n275\n00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.480\nAnd a structure,\nwhich type of formula like.\n\n276\n00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.510\nYou can make those changes here.\n\n277\n00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:29.100\nI'm not gonna hit yes and make it.\n\n278\n00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.520\nBut this is just a place to do that.\n\n279\n00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.814\nAnd you kinda enter the formula\nthat you have set for the business.\n\n280\n00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.309\nAnd I'm gonna go into business hours.\n\n281\n00:16:40.309 --> 00:16:46.900\nSo, Business hours are used for\nsupport system.\n\n282\n00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:53.070\nSo if you have anyone utilizing or\nmanaging cases in Salesforce.\n\n283\n00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.540\nThis is really where it comes into effect.\n\n284\n00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.900\nSo if you enter some business hours.\n\n285\n00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.770\nAnd you're trying to login as a user.\n\n286\n00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:02.935\nYou're not gonna be cut off.\n\n287\n00:17:02.935 --> 00:17:07.130\nThis doesn't have any\nassociation in that sense here.\n\n288\n00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.750\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I will show you how to make\n\n289\n00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:09.270\nthose changes.\n\n290\n00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.840\nThis is where you set the days and\nhours that your support team is available.\n\n291\n00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.550\nSo, again, this is relevant\nto anyone who has case setup.\n\n292\n00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.270\nAnd any support system setup.\n\n293\n00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.590\nSo you can have only one active at a time.\n\n294\n00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:28.570\nBut, this is where you go\nto make these changes here.\n\n295\n00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.599\nAnd then, of course, you have holidays.\n\n296\n00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.180\nThat will be incorporated into this.\n\n297\n00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.250\nAnd this is also useful for\nthe case escalation rules.\n\n298\n00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.370\nSo it knows where to sit them in queues.\n\n299\n00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.760\nIf you do have support\ncases to take care of.\n\n300\n00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.730\nAnd it's not within the business hours.\n\n301\n00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:48.910\nIt will accommodate these hours and\nthen the holiday hours as well.\n\n302\n00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:53.140\nThis is kind of where you wanna\nstart when you're building out.\n\n303\n00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.980\nEspecially for any support orgs.\n\n304\n00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.280\nAnd then language settings,\nso like I said earlier.\n\n305\n00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.360\nThis is going across a whole org.\n\n306\n00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.850\nSo anything highlighted in gray here.\n\n307\n00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:07.880\nMeans it's already being used.\n\n308\n00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.590\nIt's already being displayed.\n\n309\n00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:15.230\nBut if there are more languages you\nwant applicable across the whole org.\n\n310\n00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.380\nYou have these options here.\n\n311\n00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.455\nBut I would, let me see, I'll save here.\n\n312\n00:18:23.392 --> 00:18:25.090\nI kinda leave it, go ahead.\n\n313\n00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:27.060\n&gt;&gt; And so those language\nsettings apply to everybody.\n\n314\n00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.690\nIs there a way to set it per user at all?\n\n315\n00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:30.566\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, great question.\n\n316\n00:18:30.566 --> 00:18:31.632\nYeah.\n\n317\n00:18:31.632 --> 00:18:35.140\nSo this is applicable to everyone.\n\n318\n00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.450\nBut let's say I'm a user\nin another country.\n\n319\n00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.250\nI'm gonna show you how to\nnavigate to your profile.\n\n320\n00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.390\nYour settings as user, individually.\n\n321\n00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:45.920\nSo I'm gonna click up to the top.\n\n322\n00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.321\nAnd I'm gonna go to my settings.\n\n323\n00:18:54.511 --> 00:18:59.510\nSo now you can see I'm at the home\npage of the my settings section.\n\n324\n00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.690\nSo this is personable to me as a user.\n\n325\n00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:05.356\nThese are the changes that I\ncan make that affect my log in.\n\n326\n00:19:05.356 --> 00:19:08.468\nSo personal information.\n\n327\n00:19:08.468 --> 00:19:11.590\nSo as a system admin this is helpful for\nyou.\n\n328\n00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:14.340\nTo kind of show and\nnavigate the user as they come to you.\n\n329\n00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.910\nHey I logged out or I can't log in.\n\n330\n00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:19.880\nOr I'm having issues to do this.\n\n331\n00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.030\nThis is first you wanna show\nthem how to help themselves.\n\n332\n00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:27.790\nBut it's also good to know where\nthat information takes place.\n\n333\n00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:31.470\nAnd what they have capability to\ndo in Salesforce for themselves.\n\n334\n00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:35.969\nSo this will show up in their chatter\nfeed, their basic contact information.\n\n335\n00:19:35.969 --> 00:19:38.660\nSay that I wanted to make\nchanges to my name, my email.\n\n336\n00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.580\nI can do so here.\n\n337\n00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.540\nA system admin can also take care of this.\n\n338\n00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:46.730\nBut this is something that\na user has access to.\n\n339\n00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:47.410\nTo make changes on.\n\n340\n00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.360\nSo work information,\nbasic contact information here.\n\n341\n00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.410\nBut if you wanted to go to language and\ntime zone.\n\n342\n00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:57.370\nLike we were at earlier.\n\n343\n00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.660\nThese are settings that's\njust gonna apply just to me.\n\n344\n00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.910\nSo again,\neverything that we saw in the org wide.\n\n345\n00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.270\nNow this is just individual.\n\n346\n00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:15.890\nAnd referring back to the need for\nneeding to log a case.\n\n347\n00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:19.290\nSometimes, in order for\nsales force to get in there.\n\n348\n00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:20.680\nYou have to give them permission to do so.\n\n349\n00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:26.920\nSo if I'm a system admin or a user that\nhas rights to give a third party access.\n\n350\n00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:32.390\nTo either log a case or enable\ncertain features that Salesforce has.\n\n351\n00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:36.270\nOr even apps to kinda troubleshoot\nany third party apps that you've\n\n352\n00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.350\ninstalled that you need their help on.\n\n353\n00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.650\nThey will say, Hey!\n\n354\n00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.120\nDid you grant me account log in access?\n\n355\n00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.978\nThis is the place to do that so.\n\n356\n00:20:43.978 --> 00:20:47.180\nRight now if I needed their support.\n\n357\n00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:47.910\nThey can't help me.\n\n358\n00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:49.900\nCuz I needed to give them an access.\n\n359\n00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.870\nYou have the choice options here.\n\n360\n00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:56.620\nEven up to a year, months,\nweeks, to give up those access.\n\n361\n00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:01.280\nThen if you have apps, those would\nshow here as they're installed.\n\n362\n00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.060\nAnd then you have the option\nto give them access.\n\n363\n00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.940\nFor same duration that you\nsaw with Salesforce support.\n\n364\n00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:08.930\n&gt;&gt; That's a great setup there.\n\n365\n00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:10.096\nBecause I was thinking to myself.\n\n366\n00:21:10.096 --> 00:21:11.870\nOkay, now if I give them access.\n\n367\n00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:13.310\nNow I got to remember and\n\n368\n00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:15.210\ntake that away in some point\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n369\n00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.187\n&gt;&gt; But take a look right in that\n\n370\n00:21:16.187 --> 00:21:16.787\ndrop down list.\n\n371\n00:21:16.787 --> 00:21:19.170\nAnd say look, I'll give you access for\na day, or a month, or a year.\n\n372\n00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:19.910\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n373\n00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.680\nAnd just as a personal tip too.\n\n374\n00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.230\nSometimes you think something's\ngonna take a day to figure out.\n\n375\n00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:26.810\nAnd then you do one-day access.\n\n376\n00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:28.010\nBut it actually takes a week.\n\n377\n00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.290\nI say give it I say give\nyourself a little bit more time.\n\n378\n00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:35.108\nSo if it's something you think is gonna\ntake a day or two, give them a week.\n\n379\n00:21:35.108 --> 00:21:37.458\nOr if it's something really intensive.\n\n380\n00:21:37.458 --> 00:21:39.080\nI would give them a month.\n\n381\n00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:40.447\nIt's Salesforce support.\n\n382\n00:21:40.447 --> 00:21:41.980\nThey're pretty secure.\n\n383\n00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.395\nThey're not going in there- [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n384\n00:21:43.395 --> 00:21:46.350\nWe should be able to trust them.\n\n385\n00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.780\nNow, if you set that to a month.\n\n386\n00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:50.560\nThen let's say the project only took\na week for them to get it done.\n\n387\n00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.000\nCan I go back in there and\nchange it to no access?\n\n388\n00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:53.850\n&gt;&gt; You can-\n&gt;&gt; Supports up.\n\n389\n00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.260\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you can go in there and\nchange it to no access.\n\n390\n00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.070\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; For the most part,\n\n391\n00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:58.768\nI just leave open but you can do that.\n\n392\n00:21:58.768 --> 00:22:00.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay, very good.\n\n393\n00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:01.520\nAll right.\n\n394\n00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.350\nWell, I tell you what, Felicia.\n\n395\n00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.550\nIt was a great look there at setting\nup that company information.\n\n396\n00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:08.280\nYou know, that organization info,\nthe company profile.\n\n397\n00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.820\nA lot of this is done when\nyou're first setting it up.\n\n398\n00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.900\nBut it's great to know how we can\nget back in there and make changes.\n\n399\n00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.990\nAs my organization grows,\nor make changes to that.\n\n400\n00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:18.300\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n401\n00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.420\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n402\n00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.785\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n403\n00:22:22.785 --> 00:22:23.712\n&gt;&gt; I'm Felicia Duarte.\n\n404\n00:22:23.712 -->

00:00:08.281\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:12.650\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT Pro TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.700\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.950\nI'm you're host Mike Rodrick and\n\n7\n00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.400\ntoday we're doing our Salesforce\ncertified administrator.\n\n8\n00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.820\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be taking\na look, a user setup and security access.\n\n9\n00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.160\nAnd here to help us with\nthat is Miss Felicia Duarte.\n\n10\n00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.500\nWelcome back Felicia.\n\n11\n00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.500\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.760\nSo this portion here covers 9%\nof the Salesforce questions.\n\n13\n00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.372\nSo it's pretty hefty.\n\n14\n00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:42.060\nYou wanna brush up on things you\naren't aware of in this section here.\n\n15\n00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.520\nSo this covers common occurrences of\nthe Salesforce admin will set up so\n\n16\n00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.690\nthat setting up users,\ncreating users, disabling users,\n\n17\n00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.040\nand having make a changes\nto email profiles.\n\n18\n00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.330\nSo it's pretty straightforward and simple,\nbut something that you do work on and\n\n19\n00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.450\nit's a common occurrences that\nhappens as a Salesforce admin.\n\n20\n00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:09.240\nSo I'm gonna start with the basics here\nand show you how to create a user.\n\n21\n00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.740\nSome of the options you have available,\nand just kinda go through some of\n\n22\n00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.220\nthe issues with troubleshooting user,\nmost common issues and scenarios.\n\n23\n00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.590\nSo let's just start here at my homepage,\nand go back to the setup.\n\n24\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.640\nAnd this is where you'll live most\nof the time as a system admin,\n\n25\n00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.330\nin the setup section.\n\n26\n00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.230\nSo as I scroll down, I'm gonna select\nManage Users, and go to Users.\n\n27\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.160\nSo at this user home page here, right now\nwe're looking at the developer org and\n\n28\n00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.010\nso you're only gonna see the one that\nSalesforce give you out the box which is\n\n29\n00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.790\nthe chatter expert user.\n\n30\n00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.750\nThe one that I created which is myself and\n\n31\n00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.210\na couple other users that Salesforce\ngives you to kind of play around with.\n\n32\n00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.160\nBut when you're dealing with\nan organization that has 100 users or\n\n33\n00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.370\neven more than a 120.\n\n34\n00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.556\nWanna be able to split up, and\nsegment the way you see this data and\n\n35\n00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:04.860\nthis information.\n\n36\n00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.608\nSo, right you have here,\nat top is called your list view.\n\n37\n00:02:08.608 --> 00:02:11.720\nRight now we're look in a view of\nall users, but may be we wanna,\n\n38\n00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.610\nsplit it up to active or inactive users or\nby territory and region.\n\n39\n00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.830\nSo, you would just Create a New View for\nthat.\n\n40\n00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.200\nSalesforce off the box will give\nyou the views of Active Users,\n\n41\n00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.490\nAdmin Users, and\nright now the default being All Users.\n\n42\n00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:36.380\nBut if I select Create New View,\nLet's use the task of Inactive Users.\n\n43\n00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.080\nAnd all throughout Salesforce,\nas I select the view name,\n\n44\n00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.870\nif I hit tab it will automatically\nalways create that API name.\n\n45\n00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.070\nJust something to be aware of,\nas you're working through this.\n\n46\n00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.700\nSo maybe I wanna be able to filter\nout by the status of this user.\n\n47\n00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.990\nThese are all your fields\navailable to the user.\n\n48\n00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.820\nSo in a user account,\nyou can create custom fields.\n\n49\n00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.780\nJust like you can any\nstandard Salesforce object.\n\n50\n00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.123\nSo right now we're just going to do\nthe basics status or let's see here,\n\n51\n00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.280\nSo let's use the example\nof State right here.\n\n52\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.660\nI see it right here, so state equals and\n\n53\n00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.460\nmaybe I'm segmenting my users by region or\nterritory.\n\n54\n00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.020\nBut I just wanna give you\nexamples of what you can do,\n\n55\n00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.120\nwhat's in your operators\nare within Salesforce.\n\n56\n00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.049\nSo equal to being the exact,\nthen not equal to and\n\n57\n00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.510\nall of those operator\nvalues that we have here.\n\n58\n00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.800\nSo, I would just to enter the abbreviated\nform or the spelled out form.\n\n59\n00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.290\nYou can kinda catches what\ncriteria you can set here.\n\n60\n00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.870\nAnd what field do you want to display?\n\n61\n00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.730\nWhat information to be\nimportance to see at a glance\n\n62\n00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.310\nwhen you're looking through\nthis different views.\n\n63\n00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.310\nAnd who has visibility to see\nthe view that you created.\n\n64\n00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.530\nIs this something personal just for\n\n65\n00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.150\nyou to kind of quickly navigate as\nyou're working through the org.\n\n66\n00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.120\nOr is this something you want any other\nuser who has access to this area to see.\n\n67\n00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.420\nSo that was just kind of\nan example to show you list views.\n\n68\n00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.240\nAnd you'll see this all\nthroughout Salesforce.\n\n69\n00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.980\nWe'll go more in depth as\ninto the different operators,\n\n70\n00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.400\nbut that's the place to segment\nyour different users here.\n\n71\n00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.580\n&gt;&gt; That's fantastic, and as that list\ngets longer and longer and longer,\n\n72\n00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.470\nand having to filter it down\nevery time I go in there.\n\n73\n00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.560\nThe ability to save those filters, so that\nI can quickly see just what I need to see.\n\n74\n00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.700\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right.\n\n75\n00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.770\nAnd has the system admin easier,\nthe better.\n\n76\n00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.930\nThe quicker way, fastest way to get there,\nyou have to go over here.\n\n77\n00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.350\n[LAUGH] So I'm gonna go into my user.\n\n78\n00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.400\nRight now first to show up you just\nthe fields available, what you can see,\n\n79\n00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.150\nwhat you can make changes to,\nwhat is the user detail page look like.\n\n80\n00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.340\nSo right here we have\nbasic contact information.\n\n81\n00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.270\nWe have my email, user name.\n\n82\n00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.670\nSalesforce requires a nickname.\n\n83\n00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.680\nAnd some of these fields are required.\n\n84\n00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.330\nSo as we went over through in the last\nepisode with OrgY, you also have new user.\n\n85\n00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.250\nSo you have a personal address and\ntitle related here.\n\n86\n00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.780\nThis is where you make those changes for\neach individual user.\n\n87\n00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.750\nSo as we scroll through here, is this user\nhave approval, is it a delegated approval?\n\n88\n00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.350\nDoes it have responsibilities\nto be an improver?\n\n89\n00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.620\nWhat is it's role here, and this is\nwhere most of that information sits.\n\n90\n00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.980\nAnd this is where you would\ngo to make those changes.\n\n91\n00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.050\nBefore I go that, let's go into\nthe creation of creating the new user.\n\n92\n00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.306\nSo I'm going to hit New User,\n\n93\n00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:44.040\nif I'm going to add an individual\nnew user 1% percent of time.\n\n94\n00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.220\nBut if you're up and running and\n\n95\n00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.410\nyou need to add 10 users at a time\nit's faster just to create.\n\n96\n00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.410\nAnd sometimes this is often missed.\n\n97\n00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.090\nAdd multiple users,\nit just makes things easier,\n\n98\n00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.330\nit makes this sort of\ntedious process less tedious.\n\n99\n00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.190\nIf you're gonna assign them all\nthe same profile or license.\n\n100\n00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.610\nSo if I was assigning everyone\na Salesforce license,\n\n101\n00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.490\nyou'll see here that as I select\nlicense itself, it wouldn't say.\n\n102\n00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:17.380\nSelect is gonna now give me the option to\nmulti create many different licenses and\n\n103\n00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.539\nusers, I'm sorry,\nmany different users here.\n\n104\n00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.760\nSo just giving you that option here,\nwhich is nice to have.\n\n105\n00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.972\nSo I'm gonna navigate back here and\njust do one.\n\n106\n00:06:33.558 --> 00:06:37.210\nKinda hopping around here, and\ngo back into the tiles and\n\n107\n00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.620\nfields that you have available for a user.\n\n108\n00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.870\nSo going back to as part\nof different licenses.\n\n109\n00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.420\nIf you had licenses to some\nof those future licenses and\n\n110\n00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.500\nyou wanna add it to user,\nyou'll see in a place a check box here.\n\n111\n00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.450\nSo if you wanna make this a work.com user,\nif that license was available,\n\n112\n00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.950\nyou would go into this section here and\ncheck it.\n\n113\n00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.430\nAnd now they have access once you save it.\n\n114\n00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.590\nSo going through, these are just all\nyour different options that you can make\n\n115\n00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.940\nchanges to, is this a Salesforce one user?\n\n116\n00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.230\nDo you wanna remove that privilege?\n\n117\n00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:14.200\nThis is something often heard if\nyou want to not allowed anyone\n\n118\n00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.860\nto use Salesforce one app, this where\nyou need to go in and make the changes.\n\n119\n00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.170\nAcross the board,\nvia profiles and user itself.\n\n120\n00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:26.080\nSo, you can see this pretty all\nstraightforward make change to the default\n\n121\n00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.968\nlanding page, having access to\nthe force.com quick access menu.\n\n122\n00:07:31.968 --> 00:07:37.410\nSo these here, again this is per user and\nin future episodes,\n\n123\n00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:43.270\nwe're gonna go through grouping\nthese users and profiles as a whole.\n\n124\n00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.400\nLet's tackle back into here as we see\nthe Start of Day, and End of Day,\n\n125\n00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.477\nand Used Data Space and File Space,\nlet's tackle back up into here,\n\n126\n00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:00.283\nSorry, lost my place here.\n\n127\n00:08:00.283 --> 00:08:03.082\n[LAUGH] As far as the business\nhours go for the user.\n\n128\n00:08:03.082 --> 00:08:06.354\nSo this is not start of day and\nend of day,\n\n129\n00:08:06.354 --> 00:08:10.878\nit does not just give them\nrestriction as far as when they\n\n130\n00:08:10.878 --> 00:08:15.616\ncan log in if they were to log\nin during a different period.\n\n131\n00:08:15.616 --> 00:08:18.179\nThat's all related to support hours again,\nso\n\n132\n00:08:18.179 --> 00:08:20.429\nback to what we were discussing earlier.\n\n133\n00:08:20.429 --> 00:08:29.843\nBut let me navigate over to,\nCommon occurences.\n\n134\n00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:33.696\nSo as I'm here, being a system admin,\nit's very straight forward and\n\n135\n00:08:33.696 --> 00:08:34.928\neasy to create a user.\n\n136\n00:08:34.928 --> 00:08:39.770\nSo there are some required fields\nwhen you're creating a new user.\n\n137\n00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:44.320\nAnd as I do so here, you're gonna\nsee those fields highlighted in red.\n\n138\n00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.330\nSo I can have, as long as I have\na last name, I can create a user.\n\n139\n00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.310\nSo I'm going to type through here, but\nas you select the tab, some of these\n\n140\n00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:58.190\nare going to pre-fill for you, like the\nalias, you have to have an email address.\n\n141\n00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.650\nAnd then your username has to be unique.\n\n142\n00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:05.411\nSo I can with my developer org, use my\nwork email in multiple different orgs,\n\n143\n00:09:05.411 --> 00:09:06.375\nthat's okay.\n\n144\n00:09:06.375 --> 00:09:09.835\nBut your username has to be unique.\n\n145\n00:09:09.835 --> 00:09:11.792\nSo keep that in mind too.\n\n146\n00:09:11.792 --> 00:09:15.890\nAnd then as you go through this,\nso if I were just to enter a few,\n\n147\n00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:20.260\nyou see that's a nickname,\nalso gets auto created for you.\n\n148\n00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.185\nSo, everything else here\nthat's not highlighted in red,\n\n149\n00:09:23.185 --> 00:09:26.457\nsure as you know as a system admin,\nit's not a required to field but\n\n150\n00:09:26.457 --> 00:09:29.577\nyou cannot save the record unless\nthose fields are filled out.\n\n151\n00:09:29.577 --> 00:09:34.070\nWith the exception of\nthe Role field right here.\n\n152\n00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.030\nSo for this one right here,\nit's highlighted in red.\n\n153\n00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.150\nBut for the most part,\n\n154\n00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.510\nyou do not have to select a role\nin order to save this record.\n\n155\n00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:45.660\nSo everything else you select\nthe license that you wanna assign.\n\n156\n00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.250\nSo as we went through\nthose different licenses,\n\n157\n00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:49.830\nis it a standard Salesforce license?\n\n158\n00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.500\nIs it a Force.com license?\n\n159\n00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.970\nAny licenses that you have\navailable will show here.\n\n160\n00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:59.390\nSo it's not gonna show a license that\nyou haven't purchased or have access to.\n\n161\n00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:03.740\nAnd then this is also another way if\nyou've used up all those licenses,\n\n162\n00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.230\nthen a Salesforce license\nisn't gonna show.\n\n163\n00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.215\nSo this is also your way to fill out hey,\nI'm out of licenses.\n\n164\n00:10:09.215 --> 00:10:11.492\n[LAUGH] As you're creating the users and\n\n165\n00:10:11.492 --> 00:10:14.327\nsometimes you know system\nadmin will get stuck.\n\n166\n00:10:14.327 --> 00:10:18.280\nSo that's your way of knowing hey,\nI need to purchase more.\n\n167\n00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:23.430\nAnd then profiles which we'll get into,\nevery user has to have one profile.\n\n168\n00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.440\nSo, right now I am a system admin.\n\n169\n00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:31.630\nI have a system admin profile which gives\nme access to read, edit, modify all.\n\n170\n00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:36.140\nSo, if I were to select marketing user,\noffline users, if I had access,\n\n171\n00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.540\nI can make these changes there.\n\n172\n00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.710\nAnd as we scroll through,\n\n173\n00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.100\nthese are some of the changes you\ncan make which we went through.\n\n174\n00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.310\nBut for this example, I don't need\nto add anything if I wanted to add\n\n175\n00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:52.770\nmaybe a call center that we have\nconducted in the phone line there,\n\n176\n00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.166\nthe phone,\nall of that can be set up right here.\n\n177\n00:10:55.166 --> 00:11:02.410\nAnd let's scroll through, once\n\n178\n00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:07.700\nyou create a user, so you have the option\nof giving that user access right away.\n\n179\n00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.690\nFrom an implementation standpoint,\nsometimes we're not ready yet\n\n180\n00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.600\nto give out those passwords.\n\n181\n00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.031\nSometimes we're just getting the user\nsetup because we need to be able to map\n\n182\n00:11:17.031 --> 00:11:19.081\nthem to other things and\nto historical data.\n\n183\n00:11:19.081 --> 00:11:23.412\nBut by default,\nthis part here is checked off.\n\n184\n00:11:23.412 --> 00:11:28.387\nSo if I were to hit save or\nmaybe I'm going through these too fast,\n\n185\n00:11:28.387 --> 00:11:34.020\nthese users would get a notification\nwith a link to log in to Salesforce.\n\n186\n00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.200\n&gt;&gt; So even if you're not ready for it,\n\n187\n00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.012\nthey might be trying to\nlog in to your system?\n\n188\n00:11:37.012 --> 00:11:39.690\n&gt;&gt; Right, so watch out,\nit's at the very end.\n\n189\n00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.288\nI know sometimes you're kind of\nrunning through these in creating it.\n\n190\n00:11:42.288 --> 00:11:45.220\nBut look at out here and\nthen just deselect.\n\n191\n00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.820\nAnd that's great to just get your user set\nup, and not have to generate passwords or\n\n192\n00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.830\ngive them information,\ngive them an access, just yet.\n\n193\n00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.530\n&gt;&gt; Now does that still generate a password\nand just not send it to them or\n\n194\n00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.450\nnow do we have to some how reset or\ncreate a password?\n\n195\n00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.380\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, great question.\n\n196\n00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.210\nSo at the point,\nlet's say you didn't select that and\n\n197\n00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:09.520\nyou saved maybe 10 different users and\nnow you've hit the point where you wanna\n\n198\n00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.820\nassign passwords out,\nit's really a simple task.\n\n199\n00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:18.870\nI'm back at my home page of my users, so\nI would just select the users if not all\n\n200\n00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:26.710\nor one by one maybe these two users here,\nI need to send them a password.\n\n201\n00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.540\nI would just hit Reset Password,\n\n202\n00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.840\nand this also covers the topic\nof resetting password.\n\n203\n00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.920\nSo, once I hit Reset Password,\n\n204\n00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:39.360\nit's gonna send them an email to\nthe email field that we had there.\n\n205\n00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:45.840\nAnd so, that can be used across as your\nusers, or maybe they're trying to log in\n\n206\n00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.300\nand they froze out their accounts,\nthere's only so many attempts that\n\n207\n00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:55.040\nyou can make before having to hit reset\nmy password before they're frozen.\n\n208\n00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.650\nAnd at that point,\nwhen they froze out their accounts,\n\n209\n00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.710\nthey're gonna have to reach out to you,\nand you're the only person,\n\n210\n00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:04.060\nas system admin, that has rights\nto make those changes here.\n\n211\n00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:09.260\nAnd sometimes I suggest as best practice,\nyou wanna have at least maybe two system\n\n212\n00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.690\nadmins even if it's a smaller\nsize employee account.\n\n213\n00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:16.730\nBecause if one thing goes wrong for one\nsystem admin it's pretty tough to kind of\n\n214\n00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:20.170\nhave to get in there without\na system admin having access.\n\n215\n00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.660\nSo that's your place\nto make changes there.\n\n216\n00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.910\nA common issue that comes across besides\n\n217\n00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:32.760\nuser changes would be the changes\nto the email address.\n\n218\n00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.670\nSo what do you do if you need to\nchange an email address at that point?\n\n219\n00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:36.400\nWhere does that go?\n\n220\n00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.530\nWho does that go to?\n\n221\n00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:40.848\nIt's real simple as far as\nchanging the email itself.\n\n222\n00:13:40.848 --> 00:13:45.384\nBut it's good to know that if I\nneeded to change my email, here,\n\n223\n00:13:45.384 --> 00:13:51.264\nit's not gonna show me, if I were to edit\nand change it to a different address here,\n\n224\n00:13:51.264 --> 00:13:55.884\nit's not gonna change the email\naddress yet until it will send out\n\n225\n00:13:55.884 --> 00:14:00.601\nan email to the changed email address,\nuntil you select the link.\n\n226\n00:14:00.601 --> 00:14:03.905\n&gt;&gt; Kinda verifying that that is the actual\nvalid email that you wanna use.\n\n227\n00:14:03.905 --> 00:14:06.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, yes, so until that point\nit's gonna stay as the original.\n\n228\n00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.580\n&gt;&gt; I see, very good.\n\n229\n00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:15.700\nNow what about if we have people\nthat leave the organization.\n\n230\n00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.375\nHow do we deal with those user accounts?\n\n231\n00:14:17.375 --> 00:14:23.640\n&gt;&gt; Great, so it is good to know that you\ncan not ever delete a user for historical\n\n232\n00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.240\npurposes but you can deactivate a user,\nand that is what you would want to do.\n\n233\n00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:33.430\nThere are a few things you do wanna\nkeep into consideration about the user,\n\n234\n00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:39.300\nso if we go into the user itself, you can\nsee whether my role is active or inactive.\n\n235\n00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:46.200\nAnd then you'll have the option to\nchange whether I'm active or inactive.\n\n236\n00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.240\nOnce you do so, that opens up and\nfrees up the license.\n\n237\n00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.450\nAnd then there's a few things to consider.\n\n238\n00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.500\nSo, once deactivated,\n\n239\n00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:00.760\nthe user immediately loses accessibility\nif it was a part of a sharing role.\n\n240\n00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.660\nSo, you wanna keep that in mind as\nyou're deactivating those users.\n\n241\n00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:09.840\nSo, any sharing records\nare lost once you do so.\n\n242\n00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.113\nYou also can be deactivated if you are,\nlet's say for\n\n243\n00:15:13.113 --> 00:15:16.700\na costumer portal,\nif you're the administrator there.\n\n244\n00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.429\nSo, you need to go in and\nmake those changes.\n\n245\n00:15:19.429 --> 00:15:25.330\nSame to email alerts as far as\nwho the user is at that point.\n\n246\n00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.548\nAnd then, you can go in and\ndeactivate a user.\n\n247\n00:15:27.548 --> 00:15:31.772\nSo it's kind of little bit of\ndigging that you have to do before\n\n248\n00:15:31.772 --> 00:15:33.650\ndeactivating some users.\n\n249\n00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:38.010\nAnd they will notify you if they're\nrelated to anything that can\n\n250\n00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:41.410\ncause changes before doing so,\nwithin Salesforce.\n\n251\n00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.275\n&gt;&gt; And another thing I meant to ask you,\nFelicia,\n\n252\n00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:46.390\nwas the when they get sent that email\nit will say we create some new users.\n\n253\n00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:49.820\nThey're gonna get this notification\nwith this password that's generated.\n\n254\n00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.026\nIs there a timeframe when they\nhave to work with that or\n\n255\n00:15:52.026 --> 00:15:54.350\nI'm gonna have email sit in my inbox for\na while.\n\n256\n00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:55.547\nMaybe I'm not ready to\nlog in at Salesforce.\n\n257\n00:15:55.547 --> 00:15:57.669\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you have within 24 hours.\n\n258\n00:15:57.669 --> 00:15:58.299\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n259\n00:15:58.299 --> 00:16:01.074\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so before having to go in\nthere and kinda doing it again.\n\n260\n00:16:01.074 --> 00:16:03.546\nSo that's good to know.\n\n261\n00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:07.547\nAnother thing that I do\nwanna cover is IP login and\n\n262\n00:16:07.547 --> 00:16:12.830\nrestrictions, login access,\nlogin hours, and time frames.\n\n263\n00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.160\nSo there are login hours that\nI've kinda gone through that\n\n264\n00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.950\nwill allow you to only allow users to\n\n265\n00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.500\nbe available to access Salesforce\nwithin a certain amount of time.\n\n266\n00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:28.800\nSo you can set that up, and let's go\nover here to the Login Access Policies.\n\n267\n00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.821\nAnd this falls under Security Controls.\n\n268\n00:16:35.696 --> 00:16:39.689\nSo this part here will just go over\nas far as support information can go,\n\n269\n00:16:39.689 --> 00:16:41.520\nwhere that information sits.\n\n270\n00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:47.720\nBut let me go over into, Network Access.\n\n271\n00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:52.124\nAnd this information here,\nif I wanna keep track of a, first,\n\n272\n00:16:52.124 --> 00:16:53.877\na range of IP addresses.\n\n273\n00:16:53.877 --> 00:16:56.520\nSo maybe within the org that I'm in,\n\n274\n00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:01.340\nI wanna keep track of those range\nof APIs only accessible to login.\n\n275\n00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:04.172\nThis is where you select and\ncreate those ranges here.\n\n276\n00:17:04.172 --> 00:17:09.640\nIf it's just an individual user, you just\nuse the same start and end IP address.\n\n277\n00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.689\nBest practice tip too is,\nit's not required, but\n\n278\n00:17:13.689 --> 00:17:18.115\nadd a description cuz as you're going\nthrough and adding multiple, multiple, and\n\n279\n00:17:18.115 --> 00:17:19.938\nthere's some you want to remove.\n\n280\n00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:25.860\nIt's hard to keep track if you're not able\nto distinguish whose IP belongs to who.\n\n281\n00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:26.733\nBut with that, [CROSSTALK] go ahead.\n\n282\n00:17:26.733 --> 00:17:29.845\n&gt;&gt; As I was gonna say that's a great\nsecurity feature there cuz I know a lot of\n\n283\n00:17:29.845 --> 00:17:31.733\ntimes we'll have company assigned, say,\n\n284\n00:17:31.733 --> 00:17:35.118\nlaptop that has all the appropriate\nsoftware protection, things like that.\n\n285\n00:17:35.118 --> 00:17:38.620\nAnd I want my users to be able to login\nbut not maybe from their home computer,\n\n286\n00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.043\nwhich is not under my control,\n\n287\n00:17:40.043 --> 00:17:43.960\nwhich I don't know what keystroke loggers\nare running on it, and things like that.\n\n288\n00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.501\nSo being able to say you can access it,\nbut only from this IP address,\n\n289\n00:17:47.501 --> 00:17:48.614\nthat's fantastic.\n\n290\n00:17:48.614 --> 00:17:50.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH] yeah, and\nthen so you have control.\n\n291\n00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.160\nSo I'm gonna go back into\nthis Manage Users section.\n\n292\n00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.380\nSo as you saw, sometimes with Salesforce,\n\n293\n00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.380\nthere's a few keywords that I\nremember as far as how to navigate.\n\n294\n00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.840\nSo I'm just typing in user.\n\n295\n00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.850\nAnd it's gonna pull me into the areas that\nI'm looking to to navigate and go to.\n\n296\n00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:09.677\nSo I'm gonna go into\nright now Login History.\n\n297\n00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:16.217\nSo again, for the same reason\nof why you can't delete a user,\n\n298\n00:18:16.217 --> 00:18:19.339\nyou want this information for\naccountability.\n\n299\n00:18:19.339 --> 00:18:24.664\nAs a system admin maybe someone had access\nto make a change to the org as a whole and\n\n300\n00:18:24.664 --> 00:18:27.565\nthat affected something, who made that.\n\n301\n00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:30.438\nYou always have the created by and\nlast modified by.\n\n302\n00:18:30.438 --> 00:18:35.326\nBut this is your audit trail\nbetween kind of what was done\n\n303\n00:18:35.326 --> 00:18:38.870\nsetup wise in Salesforce and who did it.\n\n304\n00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.840\nSo you can use this and\nyou can generate a CSV file.\n\n305\n00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.650\nI'm sorry,\nthis is just on the Login History.\n\n306\n00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:47.660\nAnd have this generate CSV file and\n\n307\n00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:50.517\nbe able to report on it or\npull in as far as logins go.\n\n308\n00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:58.020\nAnd what I was speaking to,\nI got tongue tied, was set up audit trail.\n\n309\n00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:02.740\nSo if I hit setup, this is more or\nless what I was first\n\n310\n00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:07.010\nreferring to as far as who did what,\nwhen did they do it as far as setup goes.\n\n311\n00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:11.410\nSo this can also be pulled\nout into a CSV file as well.\n\n312\n00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:15.305\nSo we have Manage Users, and\nI like to pull this out and\n\n313\n00:19:15.305 --> 00:19:21.119\nbe able to filter out sometimes when\nthings were made, when changes were made.\n\n314\n00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:23.205\nOr I need to go in as a system admin and\n\n315\n00:19:23.205 --> 00:19:28.470\nkind of clean up work that someone else\ndid, where do I start, where do I look?\n\n316\n00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:33.460\nThis audit trail really helps me kind of\nsee what kind of work was done within\n\n317\n00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:40.090\nthe last, I think it gives you up to\n60 days of work, I'm sorry, 6 months.\n\n318\n00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:44.296\nRight now, we're in a developer org so\nit's not gonna give you that many but\n\n319\n00:19:44.296 --> 00:19:47.532\nyou have up to 6 months to be\nable to pull it into a CSV file.\n\n320\n00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:57.665\nSo as I go through this,\nlet's go through, Back into the users,\n\n321\n00:20:01.945 --> 00:20:04.770\nAnd the Identification\nVerification History here.\n\n322\n00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:11.390\nSo this will show you and display any\nverification attempts that were made.\n\n323\n00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:13.290\nIf maybe you're having\nissues with a user and\n\n324\n00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.840\nthere's multiple attempts\nbeing made from different IPs.\n\n325\n00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.630\nIs there something that\nyou need to look into?\n\n326\n00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:21.690\nDo you need to change some of\nthe settings and password settings there?\n\n327\n00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.760\nThis is just kind of the place to see in.\n\n328\n00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.447\nRight now, we don't have any,\nit's a new developer org but\n\n329\n00:20:27.447 --> 00:20:29.514\nit's good to know\nthe verification history.\n\n330\n00:20:29.514 --> 00:20:34.226\nIf they receive the email, what kind\nof issues and troubleshoot is going\n\n331\n00:20:34.226 --> 00:20:38.410\non with getting a user kind of reset and\nlogged into Salesforce.\n\n332\n00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:45.510\nAnd then, one of the last things that I\nwant to go over is the checkout access.\n\n333\n00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:50.086\nSo, as I kind of referred to as\nthe beginning, if you do need to\n\n334\n00:20:50.086 --> 00:20:55.278\npurchase more data, more licenses,\na new feature with Salesforce,\n\n335\n00:20:55.278 --> 00:20:59.683\nyou can always reach out to\nSalesforce Account executive.\n\n336\n00:20:59.683 --> 00:21:03.100\nBut Salesforce also has a checkout option.\n\n337\n00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:08.059\nAnd you'll see it as a check box within\nyour user account and it will say\n\n338\n00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:13.538\ncheckout enabled within those lists of\nsettings that we originally went to.\n\n339\n00:21:13.538 --> 00:21:19.058\nAnd if you scroll to the bottom,\nas a developer org, I will not see it.\n\n340\n00:21:19.058 --> 00:21:22.650\nYou'll see in option at the very\nbottom that will say checkout.\n\n341\n00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:27.729\nNavigating to this link here will take you\nthrough all your accounting information,\n\n342\n00:21:27.729 --> 00:21:30.138\nbilling information with Salesforce.\n\n343\n00:21:30.138 --> 00:21:31.970\nAre you up to date with your billing?\n\n344\n00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:34.225\nWho is your Salesforce account executive?\n\n345\n00:21:34.225 --> 00:21:38.193\nIt'll take over to purchasing\nnew licenses or new add-ons,\n\n346\n00:21:38.193 --> 00:21:43.330\nin case you don't wanna have to go through\nyour Salesforce account executive.\n\n347\n00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:47.248\nYou can just directly purchase and\ncheck out from Salesforce.\n\n348\n00:21:47.248 --> 00:21:48.057\n&gt;&gt; Very convenient, all right.\n\n349\n00:21:48.057 --> 00:21:53.800\nWell, again, another great look\nbeing able to set up our users.\n\n350\n00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.846\nWorking with creating their accounts,\ngiving them the appropriate level of\n\n351\n00:21:57.846 --> 00:22:01.844\naccess, setting their password,\nresetting their password if we need to.\n\n352\n00:22:01.844 --> 00:22:02.693\nWhere we can go and\n\n353\n00:22:02.693 --> 00:22:06.210\neven purchase licenses without having\nto contact Salesforce directly.\n\n354\n00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:07.830\nSo we appreciate that Felicia,\n\n355\n00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.390\nwe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n356\n00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:13.590\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Roderick.\n\n357\n00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:14.710\n&gt;&gt; I'm Felicia Duarte.\n\n358\n00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:15.561\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

00:00:24.120\nAnd particular in this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at a global\n\n9\n00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.580\nuser interface and ways we can make\nchanges to that user interface.\n\n10\n00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.290\nAnd here to show us the way,\nis Miss Felicia Duarte.\n\n11\n00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.360\nWelcome back, Felicia.\n\n12\n00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.790\n&gt;&gt; Yes, hello again.\n\n13\n00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.495\nSo this topic covers small percentage,\n\n14\n00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:41.490\n1% of the overall test but\nit's a good place to know where to go,\n\n15\n00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.860\nwhere to navigate, what changes you\ncan make to the UI of Salesforce\n\n16\n00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.021\nwithout having to go into any code or\nvisual force pages.\n\n17\n00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:53.770\nSo I'm gonna start with the basics here.\n\n18\n00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.610\nThis way, you might learn something new,\nand it might be covered in the test.\n\n19\n00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.538\nYou don't know.\n\n20\n00:00:58.538 --> 00:01:02.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's start with the homepage here.\n\n21\n00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.470\nSo I'm gonna start with\nthese tabs across here,\n\n22\n00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.310\nand we're gonna go through creating\na new app with Salesforce.\n\n23\n00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.745\nSo if you hit the + feature here,\nthis will show you all the available\n\n24\n00:01:13.745 --> 00:01:17.734\nobjects to add to the tabs across\nthe top of the homepage here.\n\n25\n00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:23.149\nSo I can select Customize My Tabs,\nand I can change the order\n\n26\n00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:29.700\nin which this app that we're in\nright now being Sales is displayed.\n\n27\n00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.570\nSo moving from up, down will show\nthings in a left to right view.\n\n28\n00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.280\nSo if I were to move, and I normally\nhave mine situated, I like the Leads,\n\n29\n00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.920\nAccounts, Contacts, Opportunities here.\n\n30\n00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.710\nBut sometimes you'll find\nit kind of mixed around.\n\n31\n00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.800\nBut let's say I don't want\nto enable Solutions, so\n\n32\n00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.350\nI'm just gonna move this here.\n\n33\n00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.390\nAnd right now, without saving, you can see\nthat Solutions was available up here at\n\n34\n00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.460\nthe very top of the Salesforce Sales\napp that we're in.\n\n35\n00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.631\nI can hit Save, and that will be removed.\n\n36\n00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:07.687\nIt does not limit the user from seeing it.\n\n37\n00:02:07.687 --> 00:02:10.999\nThere are other ways that\nthey can navigate to it, so\n\n38\n00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:14.255\nit's not your place to kind of hide or\nrestrict it.\n\n39\n00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:16.245\nIt's just visually,\n\n40\n00:02:16.245 --> 00:02:21.590\nat this point they don't see it,\nwithin this setting here, within this app.\n\n41\n00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.750\nSo, let's say you have an org and\n\n42\n00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.310\nyou have your sales users set up and\nyou have your marketing users set up.\n\n43\n00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.460\nYou want your marketing users to see\nsomething different than your sales\n\n44\n00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.110\nusers or your support users.\n\n45\n00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.630\nSo you may want your sales users\nto really use the core of the CRM,\n\n46\n00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.260\nwhich is your leads, your accounts,\ncontacts, and opportunities.\n\n47\n00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.200\nBut if you see here,\n\n48\n00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.800\nthese are the default settings that\nSalesforce gives you out the box.\n\n49\n00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.340\nSo, let's say I wanna move over,\nand sometimes you'll see,\n\n50\n00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.250\nright now in developer org,\nI'm just gonna see these here.\n\n51\n00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.450\nBut, let's say for marketing you\ncan see the tabs across change.\n\n52\n00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.260\nAnd I now need access to Campaigns,\nnot necessarily important for\n\n53\n00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.190\na sales user to have access to see, but\nit kind of just changes the way things\n\n54\n00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.880\nare laid out visually, because as you saw,\ntoo much can be too much sometimes.\n\n55\n00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.570\nAnd you kinda wanna limit and kinda\nshow them a quick way, especially for\n\n56\n00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.600\nadoption, where to go.\n\n57\n00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.960\nThese are the objects that are relevant\nto how you're working in Salesforce.\n\n58\n00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.690\nIf you had your support, maybe you just\nneed to see Accounts, Contacts and Cases.\n\n59\n00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.010\nIf you know if they're not managing or\n\n60\n00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.160\nlooking at Reports,\nthen let’s remove the option there too.\n\n61\n00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.050\n&gt;&gt; Really allows you to fine tune\nthat user interface to what their\n\n62\n00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.790\nrole is within your organization.\n\n63\n00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.400\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right.\n\n64\n00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.340\nSo, let's go through\nthe steps of creating an app.\n\n65\n00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.320\nI mean how customized you can make that.\n\n66\n00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.010\nRight now, what's sort of classic version\nand what I like to do anytime I get into\n\n67\n00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.530\nan org, I can see right here on my top\nleft, this is the release that we're in.\n\n68\n00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.215\nSo we're in the Winter 2017 release.\n\n69\n00:03:52.215 --> 00:03:55.900\nAnd they do three releases a year,\nas I mentioned.\n\n70\n00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.630\nAnd this will change as it's updated\nwithin Salesforce for every new release.\n\n71\n00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.130\nBut I like to customize that to\nthe logo of the company that I'm in.\n\n72\n00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.967\nSo changing the user interface,\nmaking a little bit more customize,\n\n73\n00:04:07.967 --> 00:04:08.794\nmore personalize.\n\n74\n00:04:08.794 --> 00:04:14.120\nSo, let's go to Set up.\n\n75\n00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.650\nAnd again I'm in my Quick Find Search\nin the Admin area still.\n\n76\n00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.720\nAnd I'm gonna hit App because there are so\nmany things.\n\n77\n00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.640\nMaybe I only remember that this\nis in the App section here.\n\n78\n00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.330\nAnd I'm gonna go through, and it's not so\nmuch more of administrator, but\n\n79\n00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.080\nnow we're gonna be in the Create\nsection of the Apps in a Build.\n\n80\n00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.450\nAll right here, and\nI'm gonna hit Create Apps.\n\n81\n00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:44.130\nSo, once I'm here, you're gonna see a list\nof the apps that we saw up above here.\n\n82\n00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.852\nI'm just gonna create New.\n\n83\n00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:49.265\nCustom App.\n\n84\n00:04:51.597 --> 00:04:54.157\nAnd usually what I like to\ndo is I like to name it,\n\n85\n00:04:54.157 --> 00:04:56.650\nthe name of the org that we're in.\n\n86\n00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.190\nSo, as this is loading, let's say the one\nthat I'm with which is Cloud Creations,\n\n87\n00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.180\nI hit tab its gonna give me my app\nname my API name and hit Next.\n\n88\n00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.527\nAt this point here if you're\nsetting up a new org,\n\n89\n00:05:13.527 --> 00:05:18.139\nfirst you want to download and\nlet me go into a new link and show you\n\n90\n00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:29.808\nYou wanna download Document first,\nso taking a step back,\n\n91\n00:05:29.808 --> 00:05:32.290\nlet's go back and hit + here.\n\n92\n00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.640\nAnd this is gonna show me\nwhere my Documents tab is.\n\n93\n00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:42.280\nSo if I had it living on my desktop\nsomewhere, I'm gonna hit Documents.\n\n94\n00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.240\nAnd it's as simple as downloading or\nuploading a new file.\n\n95\n00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.900\nYou do wanna select.\n\n96\n00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.169\nSo I usually just name it Logo, Company\nlogo, and hit External Available Image.\n\n97\n00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.563\nMy Personal Docs,\njust like you stand and browse.\n\n98\n00:05:58.563 --> 00:06:02.310\nYou upload the file and hit Save.\n\n99\n00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.570\nNow, once you have it saved,\nthen you can go back and insert the image.\n\n100\n00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.740\nSo as I insert an image,\nit's gonna pool us.\n\n101\n00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.110\nAnd it's only gonna look to the files\nthat are uploaded in Salesforce.\n\n102\n00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.201\nThat's why you wanna take that,\n\n103\n00:06:17.201 --> 00:06:20.930\nthat first step and actually make\nsure the logo lives within it.\n\n104\n00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.300\nAnd then it has to be under this file\nsize here, too, is important to know.\n\n105\n00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.910\nSo as I do it, the logo will show up here.\n\n106\n00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.370\nIf I were to hit Save,\nit's gonna replace this image up here.\n\n107\n00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.568\nAnd now you already have what looks like\na more personalized place to go to within\n\n108\n00:06:36.568 --> 00:06:38.451\nyour org there.\n\n109\n00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.071\nNow as I go through the apps,\nI'm gonna navigate back into the apps\n\n110\n00:06:47.813 --> 00:06:52.440\nI have the option of choosing what\nthe logo would look like for that app.\n\n111\n00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.170\nBecause if I went to Sales and\nMarketing the top left image can also\n\n112\n00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.840\nchange along with the app\nthat I'm in as well.\n\n113\n00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.130\nSo all of that can change there.\n\n114\n00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:06.050\nBut if I go back, let's quickly go to New,\nwe're gonna do a custom app and\n\n115\n00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.920\nstaying here, too, you also have\nthe option of doing a console.\n\n116\n00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.090\nSo whether you have a sales console,\nyou can\n\n117\n00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.480\nchange the way things are displayed and\nwhat you have access to there.\n\n118\n00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.913\nAnd we're gonna go back\nthrough these steps.\n\n119\n00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:27.254\nAnd just to show you.\n\n120\n00:07:27.254 --> 00:07:27.901\nI'm just gonna hit Next.\n\n121\n00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:34.170\nAnd I may not have needed to go back,\nbut we went through it.\n\n122\n00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.950\nNow I'm gonna select the tabs, and\nI can do it again after I save, but\n\n123\n00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.460\nif we're here then let's say,\nI just want the basics.\n\n124\n00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.740\nCore of cells for switch all.\n\n125\n00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:48.440\nRepeat over and\nover cuz this is the bulk right here.\n\n126\n00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.370\nThe bread and butter.\n\n127\n00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.706\nThe Leads, Accounts,\nContacts, Opportunities.\n\n128\n00:07:51.706 --> 00:07:55.514\nUsually I put reports but\njust to show you, I'm going to hit Next.\n\n129\n00:07:55.514 --> 00:07:57.158\nAnd now I can say.\n\n130\n00:07:57.158 --> 00:08:00.652\nWho is this visible to, and\nI have a list of all my profiles.\n\n131\n00:08:00.652 --> 00:08:04.140\nI can set this as a profile level and\nI can set the default.\n\n132\n00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.610\nUsually if I'm creating it,\nI want everyone to have access to,\n\n133\n00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.750\nI just select all and I make this the\ndefault for when they log in as their app.\n\n134\n00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:15.210\nSo once I hit Save,\nI still have to change mine.\n\n135\n00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.250\nBecause I'm already logged in,\nI already kinda have it set to default.\n\n136\n00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.270\nBut now, I can select this drop down and\nI can see the app that I created.\n\n137\n00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.612\nIf I change the logo,\nthat will change too.\n\n138\n00:08:25.612 --> 00:08:30.449\nThis is sometimes important to know as\nI'm doing trainings with other users and\n\n139\n00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:32.036\ngetting everyone set up,\n\n140\n00:08:32.036 --> 00:08:36.089\ntheir default, something as small\nas a default wasn't changed.\n\n141\n00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:38.621\nAnd so they're on board and\nwe were talking and doing on sites, and\n\n142\n00:08:38.621 --> 00:08:40.806\nthey're on board, and\nthey're still living in sales.\n\n143\n00:08:40.806 --> 00:08:45.044\nAnd they're confused because it's the one\nlogo alone is throwing everybody off.\n\n144\n00:08:45.044 --> 00:08:52.030\nSo, it's important to note to start off\nthat you wanted them to go to the default\n\n145\n00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:57.000\napp or the app that they should be working\nin, whether its just sales or marketing or\n\n146\n00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.810\nhowever you decide to\nsegment your users there.\n\n147\n00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.364\nSo that's just the lookup the homepage.\n\n148\n00:09:04.364 --> 00:09:08.248\nBut let's go into the configuration\nthat you can do and\n\n149\n00:09:08.248 --> 00:09:13.240\nI'll start with the accounts to\nthe page itself, so the page layout.\n\n150\n00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:18.900\nSo right now as you can see too,\nas I go into every single one of these\n\n151\n00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.780\nobjects in Salesforce, you'll see\nthere's an icon associated next to it.\n\n152\n00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.470\nAnd that's gonna be a quick\nway to navigate and\n\n153\n00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.060\nknow where you're at in Salesforce.\n\n154\n00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:33.698\nSo I know whenever there, I'm in an\nopportunity record, or if I see it to my\n\n155\n00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:39.159\nright, I know that's always gonna\nbe followed by this medallion here,\n\n156\n00:09:39.159 --> 00:09:44.009\nor that a lead record will have\nthis little green icon guy there.\n\n157\n00:09:44.009 --> 00:09:49.290\n[LAUGH] But going back into the layout,\nI'm gonna stay here at my homepage and\n\n158\n00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.950\nI'm gonna navigate into the record itself.\n\n159\n00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:57.880\nSo, with just point and click,\nyou can change the way things are seen\n\n160\n00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.430\non a global standpoint\nif you have that access.\n\n161\n00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:05.231\nStandard users won't have access to\nedit layout because it changes it across\n\n162\n00:10:05.231 --> 00:10:06.466\nthe board for everyone.\n\n163\n00:10:06.466 --> 00:10:10.307\nBased off the little page\nlayout that you're changing,\n\n164\n00:10:10.307 --> 00:10:15.360\nyou could have multiple page layouts\nif you do have an enterprise edition.\n\n165\n00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.270\nSo I'm gonna hit Edit Layout.\n\n166\n00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:25.650\nAnd now the layout contains\nthe fields that I have access to see,\n\n167\n00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:30.900\nthe related list, so\nthese are all the fields, the sections,\n\n168\n00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.800\nthe related list that I'm able to see.\n\n169\n00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.390\nAny buttons that I need to see visually,\nand\n\n170\n00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:43.520\nas you see at the very top,\nright now I'm in the account layout.\n\n171\n00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.570\nI can have multiple, if I had multiple\nrecord types, which I'll get through,\n\n172\n00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.450\nor multiple page layouts assigned for\ndifferent people to see different views.\n\n173\n00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:57.047\nIf I select this, I have a marketing\nlayout and a sales layout and\n\n174\n00:10:57.047 --> 00:10:58.124\na support layout.\n\n175\n00:10:58.124 --> 00:11:03.974\nSo, maybe there's information that\nmarketing users have access to that sales\n\n176\n00:11:03.974 --> 00:11:10.011\nusers don't and such, similar to the app\nas far as who can see what in salesforce.\n\n177\n00:11:10.011 --> 00:11:16.040\nBut layout wise, straightforward,\npoint, click, so I drag and drop.\n\n178\n00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:23.450\nSo I can just either hit the minus and\nits gone off the page or I can remove it.\n\n179\n00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.870\nYou know a question often see too is\n\n180\n00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.348\nwithin these tests is\nwhere can I make changes?\n\n181\n00:11:29.348 --> 00:11:35.050\nIf it's a required field you can't\nremove it off the page layout.\n\n182\n00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.910\nIf it's in an,\nyou know that by the red asterisk here.\n\n183\n00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.739\nSo if I were to remove it, one I can't and\n\n184\n00:11:40.739 --> 00:11:45.160\nit let's you know if they're an error and\nthere's no minus.\n\n185\n00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.270\nAnd these are the only changes\nI can make in settings.\n\n186\n00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:53.240\nIf it was a required field that I decided\nto make this field required, I can go and\n\n187\n00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.360\nselect the wrench and deselect that and\nmake it not required.\n\n188\n00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:02.505\nBut if it's a sales force required field,\nyou're stuck there [LAUGH].\n\n189\n00:12:02.505 --> 00:12:05.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You can't remove it off the page layout\n\n190\n00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.110\nwithout needing a visual force page.\n\n191\n00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.700\n&gt;&gt; It can be really handy though\nthere cuz obviously Salesforce has\n\n192\n00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.580\nthere required fields.\n\n193\n00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.890\nBut an an organization,\nyou might have a customer id or\n\n194\n00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.890\nsomething else that you require,\nand sometimes your,\n\n195\n00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.300\nmaybe users are a little bit lazy and\nnot wanna fill everything out.\n\n196\n00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.897\nBut you can say, look, you can't go\nany further if you don't fill this in.\n\n197\n00:12:23.897 --> 00:12:27.977\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, exactly, and\nyou can come in at this point here,\n\n198\n00:12:27.977 --> 00:12:31.771\nand at the page layout,\nall right, this type is required.\n\n199\n00:12:31.771 --> 00:12:35.918\nAnd so that's where you make it,\nor this is read only.\n\n200\n00:12:35.918 --> 00:12:41.350\nBut to this page layout for whoever sees\nthis layout, you can't make changes here.\n\n201\n00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.910\nYou can see it, but that's about it.\n\n202\n00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:48.310\nAnd so as I go through these,\nyou can also add sections.\n\n203\n00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:52.390\nSo right now, if it's grayed out,\nthey can't see it.\n\n204\n00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:57.060\nAnd I still don't know why off the bat\nsometimes Salesforce makes these sections\n\n205\n00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:01.510\nvisible only in the edit mode, but\nI think they're great sections to have.\n\n206\n00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:06.121\nSo a lot of the times as I'm setting\nup a new org, I will hit the wrench.\n\n207\n00:13:06.121 --> 00:13:10.570\nAnd now, I have the option of,\neither when I'm creating a new one,\n\n208\n00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:15.193\nchanging the name or in this case,\nI want it to show at the detail page.\n\n209\n00:13:15.193 --> 00:13:19.890\nRight now, select it to only show at\nthe edit page, the page we're in.\n\n210\n00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:23.730\nBut I want it to show,\nonce I hit save during edit mode,\n\n211\n00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.400\nthese different sections.\n\n212\n00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.414\nAnd I have the option of the layout so\nusually,\n\n213\n00:13:28.414 --> 00:13:33.071\nif it's an image that were looking\nto collect, you just put 1 column.\n\n214\n00:13:33.071 --> 00:13:36.660\nBut if there's ways,\nif there's a lot of fields on the record,\n\n215\n00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.880\nyou wanna kinda space it out and\nmove things around.\n\n216\n00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.900\nI usually go with the standard 2 column.\n\n217\n00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.200\nAnd then tab key,\nif you're used to entering data, or\n\n218\n00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.460\nyour sales users are entering data,\nand they're used to hitting tab,\n\n219\n00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.130\nin what order do you want it to follow,\nso you can have that control there.\n\n220\n00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:58.394\nSo I'm gonna hit Okay, and now you see\nthe address information is not grayed out,\n\n221\n00:13:58.394 --> 00:14:03.353\nand as I, same thing, I would go down\nfurther for additional information and\n\n222\n00:14:03.353 --> 00:14:05.890\nsuch and kind of break out the section.\n\n223\n00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:11.074\nSo you can see here, if I weren't,\nif I did not select to bring this\n\n224\n00:14:11.074 --> 00:14:16.370\nonto the detail page, it kinda just\nbunches it up into one section.\n\n225\n00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:21.560\nAnd these will go into the different\nchanges you can do as far as making\n\n226\n00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:26.750\nthe sections collapsible and what kind of\ncontrols you have on the user interface.\n\n227\n00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.780\nSo again you saw bringing down, you can\nbring fields up, you can move fields.\n\n228\n00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.474\nAnd these are your options that\nfills first give you out of the box.\n\n229\n00:14:36.474 --> 00:14:38.575\nBut you can also make changes to buttons.\n\n230\n00:14:38.575 --> 00:14:42.325\nSo maybe as you're making changes or\nbuilding things out,\n\n231\n00:14:42.325 --> 00:14:44.725\nthere are buttons that apps give you,\n\n232\n00:14:44.725 --> 00:14:49.550\nthere are buttons that you maybe\ndon't want your users to access to.\n\n233\n00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:53.100\nMaybe you don't want them to\nsee the sharing button or\n\n234\n00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.100\nhave access to change a record type.\n\n235\n00:14:55.100 --> 00:15:00.720\nThis can all be in the same way just\ndrag and drop, or pushed up here,\n\n236\n00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:06.080\nnot needed and they don't have access\nto these buttons at the very top.\n\n237\n00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.655\nNow, there are two places where these\nbuttons lives, they live at the very top\n\n238\n00:15:10.655 --> 00:15:15.960\nand that works across the object itself,\nI'm sorry, the record that wherein.\n\n239\n00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.910\nBut then your record can also\nwhat's called related list.\n\n240\n00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:25.570\nSo at the very bottom you have the options\nof bringing in different related lists so\n\n241\n00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:30.520\nif we are in accounts related list,\nmaybe we have set up assets.\n\n242\n00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:35.052\nIt's set up, and of course contacts,\nyou wanna pull in and\n\n243\n00:15:35.052 --> 00:15:38.128\norders related to these account.\n\n244\n00:15:38.128 --> 00:15:43.550\nI'm just gonna drag those over but\nmaybe it's not important to have partners.\n\n245\n00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.350\nMaybe that's not partly business process.\n\n246\n00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:49.560\nSo I just simply removed it.\n\n247\n00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.940\nBut as you see maybe you wanted them to\nbe able to see a list of some of those\n\n248\n00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.698\nrecords in the relate list.\n\n249\n00:15:55.698 --> 00:15:59.827\nBut you don't want them to have option to\ncreate a new one so, You're gonna hit,\n\n250\n00:15:59.827 --> 00:16:03.620\nlet's say, for cases being the example,\nI'm gonna select the wrench.\n\n251\n00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:10.160\nCommon question being a system admin\nthat I get is I wanna be able to be\n\n252\n00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:16.450\non an account record and see ten\ndifferent data points on my contacts.\n\n253\n00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:19.240\nBut right now,\nSalesforce is only showing me, or\n\n254\n00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:23.960\nin this cases, the basic contact name,\nsubject, priority.\n\n255\n00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.252\nMaybe you created a few custom fields\nthat you wanna be able to see,\n\n256\n00:16:28.252 --> 00:16:30.780\nadd a glance on a page, it's important\n\n257\n00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:35.705\nto bring those over in the Related's List\nsection of the object you're in.\n\n258\n00:16:35.705 --> 00:16:40.661\nSo, accounts being the most used in\nthis sense would be all the contact\n\n259\n00:16:40.661 --> 00:16:46.387\ninformation or opportunity information\nthat you wanna see in the account page.\n\n260\n00:16:46.387 --> 00:16:47.118\nAnd again,\n\n261\n00:16:47.118 --> 00:16:52.026\nsame like the tabs is you're gonna move\nit from what's available to selected.\n\n262\n00:16:52.026 --> 00:16:55.338\nYou do have a limit on ten columns.\n\n263\n00:16:55.338 --> 00:17:01.081\nBut if I don't feel like this one that\nSalesforce gave me by default is needed,\n\n264\n00:17:01.081 --> 00:17:05.257\nI can remove, let's say,\nthe owner, for some reason,\n\n265\n00:17:05.257 --> 00:17:08.578\nbut maybe I wanna know\nthe origin of the case.\n\n266\n00:17:08.578 --> 00:17:12.544\nSo, I'm just gonna remove that and\nbring it over here.\n\n267\n00:17:12.544 --> 00:17:16.900\nAnd then, up down is left to right,\nthe way you view the columns.\n\n268\n00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:21.776\nAnd you can sort the information,\nand by any of the fields, and\n\n269\n00:17:21.776 --> 00:17:23.896\nascsnding or descending.\n\n270\n00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:26.671\nAnd who do you want this to apply too?\n\n271\n00:17:26.671 --> 00:17:33.104\nShould this apply for all of your\naccounts or each individual layouts?\n\n272\n00:17:33.104 --> 00:17:37.630\nThis is why it's sometimes good to\nhave the page layouts broken down.\n\n273\n00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.450\nBut I'm gonna select OK and\nwe're still in edit mode.\n\n274\n00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:45.080\nSo, it hasn't saved any changes\nas we're making these new risk\n\n275\n00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:47.350\nchanges in numerous places.\n\n276\n00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.963\nBut let's go to the Related List,\nthey have buttons of their own.\n\n277\n00:17:50.963 --> 00:17:54.419\nSo, using the one that we were in which,\nor\n\n278\n00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:59.700\nwe can even use Activity History,\nsince we see several buttons.\n\n279\n00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:05.580\nSo, if I select the wrench,\nif I just scroll down further And\n\n280\n00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.770\nhit the +, these are my buttons\nthat are standard from Salesforce.\n\n281\n00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:14.289\nSo, maybe, I don't want my users to\ncreate a new record or in this case,\n\n282\n00:18:14.289 --> 00:18:17.623\nlog a call, or\ndo any of these basic activities, so,\n\n283\n00:18:17.623 --> 00:18:20.901\nyou just remove the option\nto do it on a Related List.\n\n284\n00:18:20.901 --> 00:18:24.363\nSo, I'm gonna hit OK.\n\n285\n00:18:24.363 --> 00:18:28.740\nAnd I made it the proper changes that\nI wanted to make for this account.\n\n286\n00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.375\nAnd then, I can hit Save.\n\n287\n00:18:32.962 --> 00:18:36.720\nAnd you always see this notification and\nthis pop-up, Are you sure?\n\n288\n00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.500\nYes, I'm sure.\n\n289\n00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.354\n&gt;&gt; And one last chance to back out?\n\n290\n00:18:40.354 --> 00:18:41.488\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n291\n00:18:41.488 --> 00:18:41.993\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n292\n00:18:41.993 --> 00:18:43.820\n&gt;&gt; And as you're setting things up,\n\n293\n00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:47.170\nyou're not losing any of the metadata or\nthe data inside of it.\n\n294\n00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:50.143\nIt's just the way\nvisually that you see it.\n\n295\n00:18:50.143 --> 00:18:54.540\nSo, you can go in and\nmake changes to it itself.\n\n296\n00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:57.469\nSo, now, as we scroll down, you saw\na lot of those buttons were removed.\n\n297\n00:18:57.469 --> 00:18:59.444\nIf I scroll down to the layouts,\n\n298\n00:18:59.444 --> 00:19:02.675\nyou can see that the address\ninformation now shows.\n\n299\n00:19:02.675 --> 00:19:07.608\nYou can see some of the sections right now\nbecause we have a feature called enable\n\n300\n00:19:07.608 --> 00:19:08.940\ncollapsion.\n\n301\n00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:13.180\nYou can pull down and\nsee more fields there within the section.\n\n302\n00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:16.440\nAnd then,\nyour way to distinguish the Related List,\n\n303\n00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.780\nthey have their icons right here.\n\n304\n00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:25.040\nAnd now, with Activity, they shouldn't\nbe able to see the buttons that we had.\n\n305\n00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.118\nSo, they were removed.\n\n306\n00:19:26.118 --> 00:19:28.264\nNow, they can't do those\ntype of features for\n\n307\n00:19:28.264 --> 00:19:31.140\nwhoever has access to\nview those layouts there.\n\n308\n00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:36.609\nBut let's scroll up to just to go through,\nif I hit Edit once more,\n\n309\n00:19:41.977 --> 00:19:47.605\nAnd this is the edit of a record, but\nI'm actually looking to go to Edit Layout,\n\n310\n00:19:47.605 --> 00:19:50.621\n[LAUGH] which is [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n311\n00:19:50.621 --> 00:19:52.200\n&gt;&gt; Which is easily missed.\n\n312\n00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.158\nAnd then, there's different views here.\n\n313\n00:19:55.158 --> 00:19:58.766\nSo, if you can see at the very top,\nyou have the mini console view,\n\n314\n00:19:58.766 --> 00:20:00.370\nthe mini page layout.\n\n315\n00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:04.290\nThis will change if you\nwere in a sales console and\n\n316\n00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.700\nyou wanted to change the way\nthat the Related list were,\n\n317\n00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.320\nwhich ones were viewed here that you\nwanted them to have access to see.\n\n318\n00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.890\nYou can change which fields are accessible\njust for the mini view of the console.\n\n319\n00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:16.510\nAnd then, same with the Related list.\n\n320\n00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:21.540\nFor the mini view, which Related list\ndo you want them to have access to see.\n\n321\n00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.980\nAnd then, you have,\nagain, the same options.\n\n322\n00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.595\nSo, that's for console, for\n\n323\n00:20:31.987 --> 00:20:35.578\nSame thing with the mini page layout,\nmini, I'm sorry, mini console here.\n\n324\n00:20:35.578 --> 00:20:40.496\nWell, those are just two additional\noptions that you have as you\n\n325\n00:20:40.496 --> 00:20:44.061\ngo through making changes\nto the page layout.\n\n326\n00:20:44.061 --> 00:20:47.320\nSo, the same thing, these are the only\navailable fields at this time.\n\n327\n00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:51.446\nAs I go through, so, I'm gonna select\n\n328\n00:20:51.446 --> 00:20:57.416\nLayout You can\n\n329\n00:20:57.416 --> 00:21:02.457\nsee that you can make these changes\nacross every object in Salesforce.\n\n330\n00:21:02.457 --> 00:21:05.450\nSo, and that's just the way, again,\nvisually how things are layed out.\n\n331\n00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.620\nSo, every object, right now,\nwe run in accounts.\n\n332\n00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.990\nYou can do it for leads.\n\n333\n00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:14.440\nYou can even do so for your task and\nactivities, and your homepage layouts.\n\n334\n00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:20.429\nSo, this is your default too, but\nyou have access to and make the changes\n\n335\n00:21:20.429 --> 00:21:24.771\nthe way data should be viewed\nvisually to specific groups of users.\n\n336\n00:21:24.771 --> 00:21:29.329\nSo, as I navigate through here, I’m,\ngonna go back into my homepage.\n\n337\n00:21:32.293 --> 00:21:38.380\nOf my leads and\nshow you the feature of list views.\n\n338\n00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:43.908\nSo, Salesforce, again, gives you of list\nviews out the box of all open leads,\n\n339\n00:21:43.908 --> 00:21:48.790\nunread leads to show you that\nyou can make custom views here.\n\n340\n00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:52.676\nToday's leads, and let's use the example,\nI'm gonna do accounts\n\n341\n00:21:52.676 --> 00:21:56.777\nknowing that there's more fields to\nkinda play with and work with here.\n\n342\n00:21:59.321 --> 00:22:03.517\nAnd not until I select Go\nwill I see all of that data.\n\n343\n00:22:03.517 --> 00:22:05.576\nSo, a lot of times,\nyou're in the homepage, and\n\n344\n00:22:05.576 --> 00:22:07.928\nyou think you have the records\nthat you're looking for,\n\n345\n00:22:07.928 --> 00:22:10.543\nbut you gotta remember to hit\nthe Go with the exclamation mark.\n\n346\n00:22:10.543 --> 00:22:11.415\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Go!\n\n347\n00:22:11.415 --> 00:22:16.610\n[LAUGH] To be able to see a list of all\nthe records that you're trying to find.\n\n348\n00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:19.440\nBut I'm gonna create a new view, or\n\n349\n00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:23.560\nI can hit Edit to kind of work\noff what we were already in.\n\n350\n00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.517\nBut this will just start us off\nfrom scratch with new filters.\n\n351\n00:22:26.517 --> 00:22:31.330\nSo, very similar to what you'll see\na few times throughout Salesforce,\n\n352\n00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:32.503\nsame operators.\n\n353\n00:22:32.503 --> 00:22:35.387\nIt's gonna pull in only\nthe fields of the object I'm in.\n\n354\n00:22:35.387 --> 00:22:38.301\nSo, if you're looking at create\ndifferent views, you gotta remember,\n\n355\n00:22:38.301 --> 00:22:41.930\nyou have to create it on every object\nbased off the data you're trying to find.\n\n356\n00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:46.690\nWith the Salesforce Classic,\nit's restricted to just that one object.\n\n357\n00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.930\nSo, there's no going\nacross different objects.\n\n358\n00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:55.296\nFor that, I would suggest reports,\nbut let's do a way to\n\n359\n00:22:55.296 --> 00:23:01.552\nfigure out how to work with this\naccount types is usually used often.\n\n360\n00:23:01.552 --> 00:23:05.110\nSo, sometimes, a field name is\ndifferent than what I'm thinking.\n\n361\n00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.360\nIf I'm ever gonna lose myself,\n\n362\n00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.290\nI go into the record itself and make sure\nthat's the one that I'm looking for.\n\n363\n00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:14.082\nSo, I'm looking to group up\nmy accounts by prospects.\n\n364\n00:23:14.082 --> 00:23:19.343\nSo, let's sort my accounts\ninto prospects here.\n\n365\n00:23:25.377 --> 00:23:29.140\nSo, I went to Create New View,\nAccounts Prospects.\n\n366\n00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:33.595\nI would say find a naming convention and\nuse it across the board.\n\n367\n00:23:33.595 --> 00:23:38.970\nBut some people use ones or\nany other type of wagons.\n\n368\n00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:39.780\nKeep it the same.\n\n369\n00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:43.680\nAnd I'm gonna let this be\naccessible to everyone and then,\n\n370\n00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.180\nfilter by all accounts within Salesforce.\n\n371\n00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:50.537\nAnd we're gonna go with the type\nEquals and if it's a pick list,\n\n372\n00:23:50.537 --> 00:23:55.230\nwhich it was, it will give you\nthe options in this lookup field here.\n\n373\n00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:59.062\nSo, I wanna look at just my prospects,\nand then, I mean,\n\n374\n00:23:59.062 --> 00:24:03.229\nif I wanna do by date range,\nI can or Create a date, just today.\n\n375\n00:24:03.229 --> 00:24:07.910\nThere's so many options that you would\nwork with your org to figure out.\n\n376\n00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.390\nBut available fields you can start\npulling in groups of fields here.\n\n377\n00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:15.170\nIf I just want to pull that I'll select\nshift and move them all to the right.\n\n378\n00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:21.429\nAnd this one maybe this is a personal one\nor I want something available to everyone,\n\n379\n00:24:21.429 --> 00:24:25.831\nI want everyone to see prospects right\nnow, so I'm going to hit view all users,\n\n380\n00:24:25.831 --> 00:24:27.952\nor a group of users, and select Save.\n\n381\n00:24:31.938 --> 00:24:35.288\nSo if we were to have a list, this would\nbe your list of accounts and prospects.\n\n382\n00:24:38.056 --> 00:24:42.660\nNow, that just touches base on list views,\npage layouts.\n\n383\n00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.950\nWe went through creating a tab.\n\n384\n00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:47.280\nBut what are some other areas\nin Salesforce that you can\n\n385\n00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.925\nmake changes to as far as\nthe way you see things visually?\n\n386\n00:24:50.925 --> 00:24:58.970\nAs system admins,\nwe've seen multiple org setup.\n\n387\n00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:02.410\nExisting ones,\nthings that were setup previous to us.\n\n388\n00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:06.700\nAnd sometimes, I've come across a time\n[INAUDIBLE] something setup that's so\n\n389\n00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.805\ndifferent and new.\n\n390\n00:25:07.805 --> 00:25:12.785\nI remember the first time these\ncollapsed sections, there's always small\n\n391\n00:25:12.785 --> 00:25:18.020\nthings that you don't know existing\nSalesforce until you're in the section.\n\n392\n00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:22.131\nSo I'm just gonna take you over there and\nkinda go through some of the key things\n\n393\n00:25:22.131 --> 00:25:26.117\nthat we use to set up just to change the\nway things can be enhanced visually for\n\n394\n00:25:26.117 --> 00:25:26.694\nthe user.\n\n395\n00:25:36.675 --> 00:25:40.707\nSo I'm going to type any user\ninterface and this is customizing,\n\n396\n00:25:40.707 --> 00:25:42.520\npersonalizing things.\n\n397\n00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.140\nSo, actually my very first\none the collapsible sections.\n\n398\n00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.739\nWe also have a quick create, so if you\nwant your org to be able to quickly create\n\n399\n00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:55.290\nareas from the home page,\nyou'll see at the top left.\n\n400\n00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:57.820\nIf you were in the console view, and\n\n401\n00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:02.310\nyou collapse a section to your left,\nthe far left view.\n\n402\n00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:06.150\nYour users aren't gonna be able to see\na call center if you have one set up.\n\n403\n00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.585\nSo, that's just one thing to keep in mind.\n\n404\n00:26:08.585 --> 00:26:13.310\nHover details if you wanna be\nable to hover over record and\n\n405\n00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:15.750\nsee the details that populate there.\n\n406\n00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:20.320\nMaybe you wanna hover over a contact\nrecord without clicking into it.\n\n407\n00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.150\nYou have the option of choosing\nwhat fields show up there.\n\n408\n00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:27.330\nSo it's been useful for\nphone number fields, note fields,\n\n409\n00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:31.180\nyou're hovering over the contact without\nclicking into different records.\n\n410\n00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.920\nSo the less clicks, the better [LAUGH].\n\n411\n00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:39.850\nAnd then some of these are by default\nwith Salesforce but some of them aren't.\n\n412\n00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:43.910\nA common one is enabled enhanced list,\nso I like to use this and\n\n413\n00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:49.610\nkeep this enabled to be able to double\nclick in my list views and make changes.\n\n414\n00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:53.732\nSo navigating back over into the all\naccounts and [INAUDIBLE] goes,\n\n415\n00:26:53.732 --> 00:26:55.950\nis this has the most data right now.\n\n416\n00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:01.460\nIf I wanted to make changes to accounts\n[INAUDIBLE] I can double click from here.\n\n417\n00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:04.764\nAnd I can see, if I wanted to\nsee a 100 records at a time,\n\n418\n00:27:04.764 --> 00:27:07.193\nyou can see where this\ncan be beneficial for\n\n419\n00:27:07.193 --> 00:27:11.266\nthe user to make changes instead of\ngoing into each individual record.\n\n420\n00:27:15.452 --> 00:27:20.360\nAnd enable the Salesforce Classic\n2010 User Interface Theme.\n\n421\n00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:25.800\nSo again, it's right now Salesforce\nLightning is not covered in the exam so\n\n422\n00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.650\neverything that's covered\nis within is with classic.\n\n423\n00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:31.240\nBut you also have the option of making\n\n424\n00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:35.040\nchanges here as far as the Lightning\ncomponents go within Salesforce.\n\n425\n00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:40.530\nAnd then Tab Bar Organizer,\nthings that we've kind of walk through\n\n426\n00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:43.700\nan option too that I\nwill get on to some orgs.\n\n427\n00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:47.699\nAnd I wanna print a list view, but\nthere's no printer option there.\n\n428\n00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.910\nIf you see it get a org and\nyou see one without a printer option, and\n\n429\n00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:56.430\nit's something that can be useful for\nthem which usually is.\n\n430\n00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:59.210\nTo go into this section here and\ntake it off in a user interface.\n\n431\n00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:04.880\nSo this is just your holding tank\nof of making visual changes.\n\n432\n00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.630\nIf something does look a little too\nheavily customized and it's not on this\n\n433\n00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:13.450\nlist it's probably developed through\ncode or a visual force page.\n\n434\n00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:17.440\nBut it's broken down into calendar and\nwhat features can you do with a calendar\n\n435\n00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.580\ncan you drag and drop sections,\ndo you want that enabled,\n\n436\n00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:27.134\nyou have to select it by default its not\nsame thing with hover links or task list.\n\n437\n00:28:27.134 --> 00:28:32.930\nSome orgs really do like to capture\nall data financial services being one,\n\n438\n00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:36.860\ndo you want to collect middle names for\nperson names or suffix.\n\n439\n00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.640\nYou wanna be able to select that first, so\n\n440\n00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:44.090\nyou have that out the box\nSalesforce field.\n\n441\n00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:49.140\nAnd then just some more basic as far\nas set up goes what you have access\n\n442\n00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.440\nto see and the list views.\n\n443\n00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.412\nBut all of that lives in this area here.\n\n444\n00:28:53.412 --> 00:28:57.590\nAnd so anytime you are in a record and\n\n445\n00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.390\nyou wanna make changes, just don't\nforget to hit the save button cuz\n\n446\n00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:05.110\nthere's no auto save in this\nunfortunately this part, in classic.\n\n447\n00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:08.462\nSo I'm going to hit Save.\n\n448\n00:29:08.462 --> 00:29:15.020\nAnd now you know the places to go to\nmake a changes visually in Salesforce.\n\n449\n00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:19.250\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, it's a great look,\nI mean amazing how customizable\n\n450\n00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:23.090\nthe user interface really is, and as part\nof the productivity from my users go,\n\n451\n00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:27.500\nit's great that I can, if there's in sales\nI can show them just what it is, really\n\n452\n00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.640\nrelevant to their job and they don't need\nto see The same thing that marketing sees.\n\n453\n00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.140\nBut for the marketing people,\n\n454\n00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.180\nI want the information that they\nneed to be front and center.\n\n455\n00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:39.500\nAnd as you said, it doesn't limit\nthem from getting the information.\n\n456\n00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.630\nThey're just putting out what they\ntypically need to do their job\n\n457\n00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:43.390\nright in front of them.\n\n458\n00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:46.734\nMake their life easier, they're gonna be\nhappy, productive employees, hopefully.\n\n459\n00:29:46.734 --> 00:29:47.494\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n460\n00:29:47.494 --> 00:29:50.099\nwe did all that without\ntyping a line of code.\n\n461\n00:29:50.099 --> 00:29:51.170\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n[LAUGH]\n\n462\n00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:52.420\n&gt;&gt; That was impressive,\n\n463\n00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:56.930\nbasically just drop and drag, wiziwig\ntype, changing things around, you can do\n\n464\n00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:02.170\nit globally on a per user basis or\non a per group basis, fantastic thought.\n\n465\n00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:03.420\nWe thank you for that Felicia.\n\n466\n00:30:03.420 -->

00:00:06.756\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:08.681\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.681 --> 00:00:10.651\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:15.148\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:16.897\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:16.897 --> 00:00:20.620\nAnd today, we're doing our sales for\ncertified administrator.\n\n9\n00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.250\nAnd in particular in this episode, we're\ngonna be taking a look at security access.\n\n10\n00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.663\nAnd here to help us and\nlend her knowledge is Ms. Felicia Duarte.\n\n11\n00:00:28.663 --> 00:00:29.948\nGood morning, Felicia.\n\n12\n00:00:29.948 --> 00:00:31.264\n&gt;&gt; Good morning, hello everyone.\n\n13\n00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:32.850\nThanks for having me.\n\n14\n00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.901\nSo I'm gonna start today\nwith security access.\n\n15\n00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:42.484\nNow this covers a second largest piece in\nwingout in the exam with about 15% weight.\n\n16\n00:00:42.484 --> 00:00:45.619\nSo this is something you really\nwanna study on, brush up on.\n\n17\n00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:48.740\nI know it can be confusing for some.\n\n18\n00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.711\nSo I'm gonna start of with the diagram\nto kinda help you understand\n\n19\n00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:58.862\nthe hierarchy of Salesforce as far\nas restricting security access,\n\n20\n00:00:58.862 --> 00:01:03.333\nopening up access,\nwhat that looks like, where to start.\n\n21\n00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.594\nSo I'll kinda lead into that and\n\n22\n00:01:05.594 --> 00:01:12.210\nopen up with our drawing that I kinda have\nhere that Salesforces uses as an example.\n\n23\n00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.490\nAnd what we have here is\nthe inverted triangle.\n\n24\n00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.540\nIt's maybe to help you understand\nbetter as far as how to open up access\n\n25\n00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.784\nwithin Salesforce.\n\n26\n00:01:18.784 --> 00:01:23.704\nSo at the very baseline here,\nyou have what we call the OWDs,\n\n27\n00:01:23.704 --> 00:01:26.409\nOrganization-Wide Defaults.\n\n28\n00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.320\nBut before that what really\nholds the record ownership would\n\n29\n00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.059\nbe the record owner.\n\n30\n00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:38.131\nSo that would really sit right here at\nthe very bottom as far as ownership goes.\n\n31\n00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:42.206\nBut then working your way\nup opens up visibility.\n\n32\n00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:47.095\nSo the Organization-Wide Defaults,\nthat really restricts access,\n\n33\n00:01:47.095 --> 00:01:50.766\nthat kinda defines within\nyourself Salesforce org.\n\n34\n00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:56.492\nAre you in a private model,\nare you locked down, are you in a public\n\n35\n00:01:56.492 --> 00:02:03.370\nmodel would be kind of the default\nthat Salesforce gives out of the box.\n\n36\n00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.335\nBut when you wanna start\nrestricting access and\n\n37\n00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:11.384\nyou wanna move away from a public model,\nyou're gonna start with the OWDs here.\n\n38\n00:02:11.384 --> 00:02:15.027\n&gt;&gt; And so this kinda really starts off\nsecure and then we have to open it up for\n\n39\n00:02:15.027 --> 00:02:18.812\npeople to access, rather than start\noff wide open and have to restrict it?\n\n40\n00:02:18.812 --> 00:02:20.361\n&gt;&gt; Well actually the opposite.\n\n41\n00:02:20.361 --> 00:02:23.342\nSo by default it starts out public.\n\n42\n00:02:23.342 --> 00:02:27.640\nSo everyone has access to\neverything at this point.\n\n43\n00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.539\nAnd then you wanna really start and\nlock things down.\n\n44\n00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:33.209\nSo you're gonna put everything in\na public, I'm sorry, in a private model.\n\n45\n00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.275\nAnd I mean if any one user,\nand this is by object.\n\n46\n00:02:38.275 --> 00:02:43.859\nSo for accounts, if any one person needs\nto be placed in this hidden record,\n\n47\n00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:47.523\nif their records need to be hidden for\none person,\n\n48\n00:02:47.523 --> 00:02:52.255\none user, you're gonna wanna\nlock things down to that object.\n\n49\n00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:56.794\nAnd I'll show you in the next slide\nafter I go through each one of these.\n\n50\n00:02:56.794 --> 00:03:00.196\nFor the next piece would be,\nafter you've locked things down,\n\n51\n00:03:00.196 --> 00:03:02.978\nyou're gonna use role\nhierarchy to open things up.\n\n52\n00:03:02.978 --> 00:03:08.319\nNow, once you have role hierarchies opened\nup and people still have the right access,\n\n53\n00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.625\nand you wanna give them and\nopen up visibility there.\n\n54\n00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:17.200\nYou have sharing rules to open up and\ngive sharing rules to groups of users.\n\n55\n00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.880\nAnd then once you want to get more\naccess and you have manual sharing,\n\n56\n00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.440\nwhere the owner of the record can open up\nif they have the accessibility to do so.\n\n57\n00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.349\nThen they can individually share records,\nso that's the manual sharing.\n\n58\n00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.020\nThat sort of Salesforce sharing model\nonto start opening that visibility.\n\n59\n00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.050\nBut let's go over into where they make\nchanges within the Salesforce org, and\n\n60\n00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.716\nkinda walk through some of those points.\n\n61\n00:03:40.716 --> 00:03:45.904\nSo Setup, And as I navigate\n\n62\n00:03:45.904 --> 00:03:52.290\nto setup you can just type in security,\nand you see the list of Security Controls.\n\n63\n00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.440\nWe're gonna go over into\nthe Sharing Settings.\n\n64\n00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.751\nSo let's say I have a sales team and\nI need to,\n\n65\n00:03:59.751 --> 00:04:06.237\nnot everyone can see everyone's\nrecords for leads or my accounts.\n\n66\n00:04:06.237 --> 00:04:10.106\nNow that we're in the sharing\nsettings this shows you and\n\n67\n00:04:10.106 --> 00:04:12.760\nthis is by default Salesforce.\n\n68\n00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.433\nPer object, Leads, Accounts and\nContacts, any Salesforce object.\n\n69\n00:04:17.433 --> 00:04:20.844\nCases, Opportunities,\nthis shows you what the default is.\n\n70\n00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:26.430\nSo right now off the bat everything\nis public, read, write, transfer.\n\n71\n00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.720\nEveryone can see everything right now.\n\n72\n00:04:29.835 --> 00:04:32.861\nThen you have to check at this point\nwhether you wanna grant access using\n\n73\n00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:35.391\nhierarchies, but\nright now everyone can see everything.\n\n74\n00:04:35.391 --> 00:04:38.244\nAnd then you can take\nthis all the way down and\n\n75\n00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:40.571\nyou can see how granular it can get.\n\n76\n00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:45.326\nYou can do this based off even\nthe activities within Salesforce,\n\n77\n00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:49.648\nsome of the other small objects\nlike the Feedback, Goals,\n\n78\n00:04:49.648 --> 00:04:54.070\nMetrics, you can see here what\nyour options are per object.\n\n79\n00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.928\nAnd then you have the settings, which\nwe'll get to in a bit as far as report\n\n80\n00:04:58.928 --> 00:05:01.926\nvisibility, once you do kind\nof lock down those settings.\n\n81\n00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:06.245\nSo if I were to say go in for\nmy accounts in Accounts and Contacts.\n\n82\n00:05:06.245 --> 00:05:11.388\nThis one is Accounts and Contracts,\nthose are tied together.\n\n83\n00:05:11.388 --> 00:05:15.940\nBut these three here,\nI would go into my Edit.\n\n84\n00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.535\nAnd you can see you have three or\nfour different types.\n\n85\n00:05:21.535 --> 00:05:27.420\nSo you can change it from a public right\nnow, which is Public Read Write Transfer.\n\n86\n00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.905\nSo anyone can read it,\nanyone can make changes.\n\n87\n00:05:29.905 --> 00:05:35.130\nAnyone can transfer any of\nthe records at this point.\n\n88\n00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.352\nAnd to be clear, we're making changes\nto the access of the records.\n\n89\n00:05:40.352 --> 00:05:44.258\nSo you have two different ways to make\nchanges within security in Salesforce.\n\n90\n00:05:44.258 --> 00:05:48.376\nIt's what permissions can\nI do within Salesforce and\n\n91\n00:05:48.376 --> 00:05:50.579\nthen what records can I see?\n\n92\n00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:57.162\nSo record as far as seen records\nthis is your Public Read Write.\n\n93\n00:05:57.162 --> 00:06:02.020\nSo do you wanna give access where they\ncan read and write and not just transfer?\n\n94\n00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.483\nOr do you wanna give access where\nthey can only see the records and\n\n95\n00:06:04.483 --> 00:06:05.999\nthey can't make changes to anything.\n\n96\n00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:07.675\nSo as a system admin,\n\n97\n00:06:07.675 --> 00:06:12.995\nyou can make those changes across\nthe board org wide for your users.\n\n98\n00:06:12.995 --> 00:06:18.980\nSo if I wanted to lock things down and\nmake things private.\n\n99\n00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.890\nSalesforce is gonna prompt you.\n\n100\n00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.473\nAre you sure?\n[LAUGH]\n\n101\n00:06:22.473 --> 00:06:23.990\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n102\n00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.532\n&gt;&gt; Do you wanna make things private?\n\n103\n00:06:24.532 --> 00:06:26.675\nAnd it's also letting you know that each\nlead queue must have at least one member.\n\n104\n00:06:26.675 --> 00:06:29.884\nIf you're gonna go ahead and\nmove over into a private sharing model.\n\n105\n00:06:29.884 --> 00:06:31.478\nSo we're gonna select OK.\n\n106\n00:06:31.478 --> 00:06:35.882\nWe wanna make things private here for\nmaybe just my accounts and\n\n107\n00:06:35.882 --> 00:06:39.386\nin this case, contracts or\nmaybe just my orders.\n\n108\n00:06:39.386 --> 00:06:41.878\nBut you can do it project based and\n\n109\n00:06:41.878 --> 00:06:47.450\nif you wanna keep everything public,\nthat's all right too.\n\n110\n00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.788\nAnd then another thing you see\nhere is controlled by parent.\n\n111\n00:06:49.788 --> 00:06:52.562\nSo you could have\nthe hierarchy relationship.\n\n112\n00:06:52.562 --> 00:06:56.594\nYou can have your parent account and\nyour child account, and\n\n113\n00:06:56.594 --> 00:07:01.351\nyou can use that as for any children\nrecords that you have access to see.\n\n114\n00:07:01.351 --> 00:07:05.861\nDo you want that to kinda determine\nwhat access you have into those records.\n\n115\n00:07:05.861 --> 00:07:10.043\nIf you can see the parents,\nthen you can also see the children, so\n\n116\n00:07:10.043 --> 00:07:14.473\nthis is your four different options\nyou have here for these objects.\n\n117\n00:07:14.473 --> 00:07:17.978\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna make it a little easier to\nwork with permissions when you can set it\n\n118\n00:07:17.978 --> 00:07:20.507\nat one level and\nlet that inherit down at the child objects\n\n119\n00:07:20.507 --> 00:07:21.717\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right.\n\n120\n00:07:21.717 --> 00:07:25.735\nSo if we were to hit Save,\nwe are now moving into for\n\n121\n00:07:25.735 --> 00:07:28.142\nthe lead object in this case.\n\n122\n00:07:28.142 --> 00:07:31.212\nAnd it's gonna let you know who did it,\nwho's accountable,\n\n123\n00:07:31.212 --> 00:07:32.580\nit's me as a system admin.\n\n124\n00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.959\nI make things private at this time for\nthose objects here.\n\n125\n00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:43.772\nSo now we've restricted access,\ngoing back into my drawing here.\n\n126\n00:07:43.772 --> 00:07:48.550\nFor leads, we are now in a private mode.\n\n127\n00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:54.330\nBut what if I need to open up\naccess to the records to different\n\n128\n00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.580\nroles within Salesforce?\n\n129\n00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.370\nSo I'm gonna move over and\nshow the role hierarchy.\n\n130\n00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.270\nSo now I need visibility to open up.\n\n131\n00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.298\nEverything is private, but\nI need my, let's use an example,\n\n132\n00:08:05.298 --> 00:08:08.797\nI need my sales managers to\nsee that the sales records.\n\n133\n00:08:08.797 --> 00:08:12.820\nSo we don’t wanna keep things too private.\n\n134\n00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:16.600\nSo to start,\nyou wanna start using hierarchies.\n\n135\n00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.850\nSo we're gonna go to the quick\nfind search, and I type in roles.\n\n136\n00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:29.141\nNow Salesforce gives you this nice\ndiagram to kinda help you understand.\n\n137\n00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:32.231\nAnd I'm gonna zoom in here,\nso everyone can see,\n\n138\n00:08:32.231 --> 00:08:36.420\nto help you understand the role\nhierarchy and how it works.\n\n139\n00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:40.346\nThis right here, where you can click\ninto three different examples,\n\n140\n00:08:40.346 --> 00:08:43.150\nis just based off the org\nthat you're setting up.\n\n141\n00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.264\nAnd what it could look like for\n\n142\n00:08:45.264 --> 00:08:49.670\nthem if they were in a product\nbased industry or company size.\n\n143\n00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.660\nAnd just give you some ideas and\nhow it would work.\n\n144\n00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.340\nI usually like to go with\nthe sales rep example to show you.\n\n145\n00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.460\nSo you have your executive\nstaff at the very top.\n\n146\n00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.884\nAnd to start, this isn't necessarily\neveryone's role within the org itself.\n\n147\n00:09:03.884 --> 00:09:07.780\nSo it's not always a CEO or president.\n\n148\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:12.780\nMaybe you need your marketing user\nto see access into everything,\n\n149\n00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:17.670\ncuz they're setting up campaigns and\nthey need to see all records.\n\n150\n00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.707\nSo they'll sit at the very top,\nin any instance.\n\n151\n00:09:20.707 --> 00:09:25.724\nSo right now in this example,\nwe have CEO, the President, CFO,\n\n152\n00:09:25.724 --> 00:09:31.530\nVP of Sales and they need to see\naccess into everything below them.\n\n153\n00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.890\nSo anyone, the thought is\nanything that goes beneath them,\n\n154\n00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.850\nthey have access to see those records.\n\n155\n00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.860\nYou're west, so\n\n156\n00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:43.600\nyou have your Sales Directors Going\nfrom Western, Eastern, International.\n\n157\n00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.847\nAnd then they can see\ntheir sales reps records.\n\n158\n00:09:46.847 --> 00:09:50.983\nBut the sales reps can't\nsee anything above them and\n\n159\n00:09:50.983 --> 00:09:54.660\nthey can't see anything\nto the side of them.\n\n160\n00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.970\nSo think of it sort of layers up,\nshields up here.\n\n161\n00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.715\nYou cannot see anything\ngoing left to right.\n\n162\n00:10:00.715 --> 00:10:06.180\nYou cannot see anything above you, but\nif you can see everything below you.\n\n163\n00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.689\nThis kind of goes into the example\nof sharing rules here now.\n\n164\n00:10:10.689 --> 00:10:14.299\nSo let's say in the case,\nyour Western sales director and\n\n165\n00:10:14.299 --> 00:10:17.769\nEastern sales director,\nthey can see their sales rep.\n\n166\n00:10:17.769 --> 00:10:21.848\nBut maybe for this org,\nyou want it accessible for\n\n167\n00:10:21.848 --> 00:10:27.510\nyour VP of sales or sales directors\nwho see everyone else's data.\n\n168\n00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:31.352\nOr you want a group demo and you want\ninternational sales director still to be\n\n169\n00:10:31.352 --> 00:10:34.532\nable to see the sales rep records for\nthe Western and Eastern and\n\n170\n00:10:34.532 --> 00:10:38.033\nnot just international or however\nyou decide to set it up for the org.\n\n171\n00:10:38.033 --> 00:10:40.477\nThat's a good kind of set up for\n\n172\n00:10:40.477 --> 00:10:45.842\nto introduce next staff in that\ninverted pyramid of sharing roles.\n\n173\n00:10:45.842 --> 00:10:51.508\nSo the first staff to wanting to do that\nis placing them into their own groups,\n\n174\n00:10:51.508 --> 00:10:56.130\nand sharing roles work best when\nyou're allowing it to group of\n\n175\n00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.675\nusers rather than an individual.\n\n176\n00:10:58.675 --> 00:11:03.735\nSo I would place them into\na public group first and\n\n177\n00:11:03.735 --> 00:11:10.289\nwith the sharing row I would open\nup access to that group users.\n\n178\n00:11:10.289 --> 00:11:17.430\nNow I'm gonna navigate back\ninto my sharing settings.\n\n179\n00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:25.584\nAnd at the same page here, you can\nsee That as I scroll to the bottom,\n\n180\n00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:32.600\nthe same place where we changed those OWD\ndefaults, and go down to the very bottom.\n\n181\n00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.545\nPer object you can have Sharing Rules.\n\n182\n00:11:35.545 --> 00:11:40.063\nSo maybe for\nmy accounts in that example that we had,\n\n183\n00:11:40.063 --> 00:11:44.800\nI wanna open up Sharing Rules for\nthose group of users.\n\n184\n00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.120\nSo you title your Rule and\nthen you can select your Rule type.\n\n185\n00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.770\nIs this based off the record owner?\n\n186\n00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:55.461\nBased off a set of criteria that you\ngive it in order to set up that access?\n\n187\n00:11:55.461 --> 00:12:00.956\nSo you kinda have a lot of controls there\nwhen you have that criteria based setting.\n\n188\n00:12:00.956 --> 00:12:04.138\n&gt;&gt; Cuz then you could pull from any of\nthe fields in those records to determine\n\n189\n00:12:04.138 --> 00:12:05.951\nwhether or not those records are shared?\n\n190\n00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:06.670\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n191\n00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:07.246\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n192\n00:12:07.246 --> 00:12:11.943\n&gt;&gt; Right, and the first step really though\nis if you have that group created already,\n\n193\n00:12:11.943 --> 00:12:14.639\nthen you can just select\nfrom the public group.\n\n194\n00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:16.509\nRight now my only options,\n\n195\n00:12:16.509 --> 00:12:20.588\ncuz it's not setup [COUGH]\nare all in around internal users.\n\n196\n00:12:20.588 --> 00:12:24.129\nSo you would first wanna go in there,\nand set up a group public group.\n\n197\n00:12:24.129 --> 00:12:28.974\nVP of sales make it best practice\nwere you are able to know this\n\n198\n00:12:28.974 --> 00:12:32.783\nway if you have a long\nlist of different groups.\n\n199\n00:12:32.783 --> 00:12:34.442\nYou know which one you go into and\n\n200\n00:12:34.442 --> 00:12:37.157\nit's easily it would\ndetermine at this point here.\n\n201\n00:12:37.157 --> 00:12:40.511\nYou can select the users to share it with.\n\n202\n00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:43.829\nAnd at that point that's records\nto be shared and same thing.\n\n203\n00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:47.088\nHave the group ready to go,\nso you can select just for\n\n204\n00:12:47.088 --> 00:12:49.173\nthis one specific sharing role.\n\n205\n00:12:49.173 --> 00:12:55.770\nAnd then you determine the level of access\nfor that group under what criteria?\n\n206\n00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.999\nWho do you want to share it with and what\nkind of access you want to give to them?\n\n207\n00:12:58.999 --> 00:13:03.921\nYou just wanna give them just read-only\naccess or do you wanna give them the same\n\n208\n00:13:03.921 --> 00:13:07.610\ntype of privileges to read and\nedit, and you see that here.\n\n209\n00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:08.977\n&gt;&gt; So Read Write.\n\n210\n00:13:08.977 --> 00:13:12.049\n&gt;&gt; So it this something that you\nrecommend to your organizations\n\n211\n00:13:12.049 --> 00:13:14.008\nthat the kind of plan out ahead of time.\n\n212\n00:13:14.008 --> 00:13:16.934\nDecide what groups they're going to need,\nwhat access they're going to need,\n\n213\n00:13:16.934 --> 00:13:18.667\nand kind of get all those\ngroups created first?\n\n214\n00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:21.273\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and that's how I suggest.\n\n215\n00:13:21.273 --> 00:13:25.529\nSo if you have things locked down, you're\ngonna start with the role hierarchy first,\n\n216\n00:13:25.529 --> 00:13:28.461\nand it's somewhat of a baseline\nas far as restrictions go.\n\n217\n00:13:28.461 --> 00:13:29.982\nYou wanna keep it at a minimum.\n\n218\n00:13:29.982 --> 00:13:33.767\nAnd then start opening up on\naccess with sharing roles.\n\n219\n00:13:33.767 --> 00:13:39.145\nNow if you start getting real granular,\nyou need to open up or you can access like\n\n220\n00:13:39.145 --> 00:13:44.541\nas mention with a manual sharing to an\nindividual user, you have the option to.\n\n221\n00:13:44.541 --> 00:13:46.856\nIf you are the records owner and\n\n222\n00:13:46.856 --> 00:13:51.380\nyou have the button on the page\nlayout called sharing.\n\n223\n00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.464\nYou have the option to\nshare that record and\n\n224\n00:13:54.464 --> 00:13:57.642\nlet's go into one of\nthe page layouts here.\n\n225\n00:13:57.642 --> 00:14:02.455\nWith an individual user of Salesforce,\nit may not off the bat think we've\n\n226\n00:14:02.455 --> 00:14:06.038\nremoved some buttons in one\nof the previous episodes.\n\n227\n00:14:06.038 --> 00:14:10.466\nBut you can just pull over sharing here.\n\n228\n00:14:10.466 --> 00:14:16.394\nSo I'm just gonna drag and\ndrop this over into our let\n\n229\n00:14:16.394 --> 00:14:21.532\nme zoom out here, so\nI can usually move that.\n\n230\n00:14:21.532 --> 00:14:27.249\nAnd I'm just going to move the sharing\nbutton over to the page layout.\n\n231\n00:14:27.249 --> 00:14:31.869\nAnd again, you have control on the page\nlayout what buttons they have access to.\n\n232\n00:14:31.869 --> 00:14:34.308\nAnd that's another kind of permission set.\n\n233\n00:14:34.308 --> 00:14:36.182\nWhat can I do within Salesforce?\n\n234\n00:14:36.182 --> 00:14:39.868\nAnd I think this one for this is hidden,\nso we don't see it right now,\n\n235\n00:14:39.868 --> 00:14:41.410\nwhich takes further setup.\n\n236\n00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:43.980\nBut if you had access to see it,\nyou would see that sharing button.\n\n237\n00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.862\nYou would select the sharing button and\nyou're prompted to a page to select,\n\n238\n00:14:48.862 --> 00:14:50.450\nshare it with this user.\n\n239\n00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:54.490\nThis kind of leads me to the next point,\n\n240\n00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:59.510\nif you're sharing records and\nyou're opening up access.\n\n241\n00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:03.101\nYou kind of run in to some issues\nwith being in private mode.\n\n242\n00:15:03.101 --> 00:15:06.157\nSo there are some things to be aware of,\n\n243\n00:15:06.157 --> 00:15:12.008\nof when you are setting up in OWD kind\nof setting, more of private setting.\n\n244\n00:15:12.008 --> 00:15:15.940\nAnd someone that to keep in\nmind is duplicate records.\n\n245\n00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:20.071\nSo maybe I have access to set\na records maybe in this example,\n\n246\n00:15:20.071 --> 00:15:21.691\nwe're both sales rep.\n\n247\n00:15:21.691 --> 00:15:23.050\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n248\n00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:24.193\n&gt;&gt; And we may not cover the same\n\n249\n00:15:24.193 --> 00:15:26.545\nterritory, but\nwe maybe reaching out the same person.\n\n250\n00:15:26.545 --> 00:15:30.522\nOr the record may exist and\nbest practice is to search for\n\n251\n00:15:30.522 --> 00:15:33.323\nsomething first before you create it.\n\n252\n00:15:33.323 --> 00:15:36.657\nBut if I can't see it that that account\nexists or that that lead exists,\n\n253\n00:15:36.657 --> 00:15:38.333\nI'm creating a duplicate record.\n\n254\n00:15:38.333 --> 00:15:42.576\nAnd aside from that, you have a collision.\n\n255\n00:15:42.576 --> 00:15:44.657\nSo we're both contacting the same person.\n\n256\n00:15:44.657 --> 00:15:49.677\nSo you do wanna kind of watch out for that\nwhen you are in a private sharing model.\n\n257\n00:15:49.677 --> 00:15:54.672\nBut you need to, in some orgs,\nyou do need to be in that model.\n\n258\n00:15:54.672 --> 00:15:56.162\nSo that's just one thing to look into.\n\n259\n00:15:56.162 --> 00:16:01.160\nThe next part would be troubleshooting it.\n\n260\n00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.065\nSo you may think you have things locked\ndown, but then you'll have a user saying\n\n261\n00:16:05.065 --> 00:16:08.577\nhey, to system management,\nI'm supposed to see this set of records.\n\n262\n00:16:08.577 --> 00:16:11.255\nOr they're not seeing what\nthey should be seeing or\n\n263\n00:16:11.255 --> 00:16:14.879\nmaybe somebody is seeing something\nthat they shouldn't be seeing.\n\n264\n00:16:14.879 --> 00:16:19.583\nSo I always recommend to test\nfirst Salesforce out the back, so\n\n265\n00:16:19.583 --> 00:16:21.642\nlet me go to my screen here.\n\n266\n00:16:21.642 --> 00:16:25.547\n[COUGH] And we're gonna go into Setup.\n\n267\n00:16:25.547 --> 00:16:28.462\nThere's two ways that I\nlike to troubleshoot this.\n\n268\n00:16:28.462 --> 00:16:35.797\nSo you can go into the users and out of\nthe box, you see your list of users here.\n\n269\n00:16:35.797 --> 00:16:40.737\nBut if you log a case with Salesforce,\nyou can enable feature called\n\n270\n00:16:40.737 --> 00:16:45.480\nLogin Activation, and\nthose set it up for you the same day.\n\n271\n00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.070\nAnd what that would do\nis that will give you\n\n272\n00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.250\nanother link right here to\nthe right that will say Login.\n\n273\n00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:55.430\nAnd only for system admins at\nthe user level at this page here,\n\n274\n00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.920\nyou'll be able to login to each user.\n\n275\n00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.492\nAnd I would go in and\n\n276\n00:16:59.492 --> 00:17:04.912\ncheck per role hierarchy base what\neach person has access to see.\n\n277\n00:17:04.912 --> 00:17:10.079\nAnd at this point, you'll be able to kind\nof test and see in the role hierarchy\n\n278\n00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:15.823\nthat they're sitting in, in the sharing\nroles, are they seeing the right records?\n\n279\n00:17:15.823 --> 00:17:20.740\nA second way to troubleshoot\nthis would be the Sharing Roles.\n\n280\n00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:25.487\nSo if they had access into the role,\nthey'll see that share button.\n\n281\n00:17:25.487 --> 00:17:28.316\nAnd then there's another link\nthere that will say why,\n\n282\n00:17:28.316 --> 00:17:30.131\nwhy do I have access to seeing this?\n\n283\n00:17:30.131 --> 00:17:35.061\nSo that'll kind of show you and\ntell you it's based off a hierarchy,\n\n284\n00:17:35.061 --> 00:17:38.721\nit was shared with you\nbecause the manual sharing.\n\n285\n00:17:38.721 --> 00:17:42.580\nAnd it'll give you more details as\nto why you can see that record.\n\n286\n00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:47.561\nThis way you can troubleshoot back and\nsee, okay, I need a lot of things\n\n287\n00:17:47.561 --> 00:17:52.808\ndown further here, or maybe I placed\nthem into the wrong hierarchy group.\n\n288\n00:17:52.808 --> 00:17:56.318\nAnd then you wanna go back in,\ngo to your roles.\n\n289\n00:17:56.318 --> 00:18:03.490\nAnd this is a job that's really helped\nby system admin to have to take care of.\n\n290\n00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:08.580\nAnd I'm going to set up roles and\nI'm back here to the role hierarchy.\n\n291\n00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.133\nAnd we don't have a whole lot of\nusers in the developer accounts,\n\n292\n00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:14.078\nbut you can see how they expand all.\n\n293\n00:18:14.078 --> 00:18:16.402\nI can see the levels here.\n\n294\n00:18:16.402 --> 00:18:21.843\nSo I see at the top level, we have\nthe CEOs and CFOs set at the very top.\n\n295\n00:18:21.843 --> 00:18:25.830\nAnd we see the way it's breaking\ndown in this kind of branching here.\n\n296\n00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.846\nAnd we can at this point, if we had users,\n\n297\n00:18:28.846 --> 00:18:32.490\nwe would be able to say\nwho sits under here.\n\n298\n00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:36.156\nAnd you can make changes to the roles and\nit's real easy to move people around.\n\n299\n00:18:36.156 --> 00:18:40.812\nBut that's a great way to troubleshoot\nany problems that you come across.\n\n300\n00:18:40.812 --> 00:18:44.860\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic, really good look there about\nhow we can go about controlling access or\n\n301\n00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.927\nsecuring access which is you mentioned.\n\n302\n00:18:46.927 --> 00:18:48.803\nOne is a big part of the exam, and two,\n\n303\n00:18:48.803 --> 00:18:51.813\nI would think it's a big part\nof your daily administration.\n\n304\n00:18:51.813 --> 00:18:56.650\nAnd that is to control what access\nyour users have within Salesforce.\n\n305\n00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:57.880\nWe thank you for that Felicia.\n\n306\n00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.379\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n307\n00:18:59.379 --> 00:19:02.739\nSigning out for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Mike

00:00:08.873\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.873 --> 00:00:10.503\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.503 --> 00:00:15.104\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.104 --> 00:00:16.841\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\n\n7\n00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:20.230\ntoday we're doing our\nSalesforce Certified Administrator.\n\n8\n00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.970\nAnd in this episode we're actually\ncontinuing our thought process\n\n9\n00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.450\non security access.\n\n10\n00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.250\nSo part two, if you missed first part make\nsure you go back and check that out and\n\n11\n00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.040\njoin us back here for part two.\n\n12\n00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.030\nAnd here's to help us with all of these,\nis Miss Felicia Duarte.\n\n13\n00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.270\nHow you're doing Felicia?\n\n14\n00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.620\n&gt;&gt; Great thanks.\n\n15\n00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.040\nSo in our last episode we went\nthrough what a user can see.\n\n16\n00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.680\nNow we're gonna go through\nwhat a user can do.\n\n17\n00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.230\nSo we're gonna discuss profiles and\npermission sets.\n\n18\n00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.680\nSo all the accessibility that\na user can do within Salesforce,\n\n19\n00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.700\nwhat controls do they have?\n\n20\n00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.020\nWhat access do they have to make\nchanges within the Salesforce org?\n\n21\n00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.394\nAnd with Salesforce,\nwithin the Salesforce org.\n\n22\n00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:04.038\n[LAUGH] So let's go into profiles.\n\n23\n00:01:07.485 --> 00:01:08.328\nLet me navigate over\n\n24\n00:01:08.328 --> 00:01:18.679\nhere.\n\n25\n00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:22.480\nNow, we have right here\nchoices of 36 profiles.\n\n26\n00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.110\nBut Salesforce, and\nthis goes off the licenses that you have.\n\n27\n00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.540\nWe're in a developer org so\nI have more access.\n\n28\n00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.640\nBut you're really working with about\nfive different profiles to start with.\n\n29\n00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.120\nWe'll go through those options here.\n\n30\n00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.820\nI'm gonna zoom in a little bit so\nwe can see here, and\n\n31\n00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.340\nwe see a list of all our profiles.\n\n32\n00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.790\nNow profiles, typically\nare determined by the job function.\n\n33\n00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.440\nSo you can only as a user,\nyou can have multiple profiles created.\n\n34\n00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.010\nBut you can per user only\nbe assigned one profile.\n\n35\n00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.120\nSo I've been into, as a system admin,\ninto different orgs, and\n\n36\n00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.180\nI've seen hundreds of profiles created.\n\n37\n00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.355\nAnd this is before permission\nsets were built long ago.\n\n38\n00:02:08.355 --> 00:02:12.375\nAnd you will just have the admin just\ncreating profiles and profiles for\n\n39\n00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:17.305\ndifferent users to kind of break down\nthe access for each different user or\n\n40\n00:02:17.305 --> 00:02:21.042\na group of users and it just gets,\nit's too much sometimes.\n\n41\n00:02:21.042 --> 00:02:25.482\nAnd that's why you have permission\nsets to then give permission.\n\n42\n00:02:25.482 --> 00:02:28.132\nBut you wanna keep your profiles at\n\n43\n00:02:28.132 --> 00:02:32.852\na bare minimum as far as what you wanna\ngive them access to do within Salesforce.\n\n44\n00:02:34.032 --> 00:02:38.082\n&gt;&gt; Are we usually making these profiles\nthen kind of based on maybe job role or\n\n45\n00:02:38.082 --> 00:02:40.252\nlevel of access that a group\nof people is gonna need?\n\n46\n00:02:40.252 --> 00:02:41.252\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n47\n00:02:41.252 --> 00:02:45.940\nAnd in the example of your role\nsystem admin, you're system admin,\n\n48\n00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.040\nyou're administrator to\neverything within Salesforce.\n\n49\n00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.030\nBut then you have your out-the-box\nprofile to be a standard user.\n\n50\n00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.010\nAnd that's what most orgs start with.\n\n51\n00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.560\nSo we're gonna scroll all the way\nto the bottom and let me zoom out,\n\n52\n00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.060\ncuz right here it's called Standard User\nand we have Standard Platform Users.\n\n53\n00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.844\nAnd you can see to the right\nthe license that it pertains to.\n\n54\n00:03:10.844 --> 00:03:15.520\nSo we're working with and\ndiscussing just Salesforce licenses.\n\n55\n00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.155\nAnd so\nif we go into Standard User profile here.\n\n56\n00:03:19.641 --> 00:03:23.204\nI would start as you're\nbuilding out your profiles,\n\n57\n00:03:23.204 --> 00:03:26.380\nthink of the questions for\nthis group of users.\n\n58\n00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.100\nWhoever you want to assign this profile\nto, what tabs do I want them to see?\n\n59\n00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.630\nWhat records as far as record\ntypes should they have access to?\n\n60\n00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.020\nThe objects, we had discussed in some\nearlier episodes that at the very top,\n\n61\n00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.150\nas far as tabs go, yeah you can hide\nthem based off the app that you're in.\n\n62\n00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.140\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean\nthat you can't find shortcuts or\n\n63\n00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.440\ndifferent ways to navigate\nto those objects.\n\n64\n00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.630\nSo at this point here, for the profile,\nthat's kind of where you hide things for\n\n65\n00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.140\nwhat they can see in the object itself.\n\n66\n00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.160\nSo if you go down further,\nwhat apps don't I want them to see?\n\n67\n00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.460\nMaybe there are certain apps that you're\ncreating that are just for your sales\n\n68\n00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.140\nusers or just for your marketing users,\nand you don't want them to have access to.\n\n69\n00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.310\nCan utilize it and see, so there may be\nobjects created that are not meant for\n\n70\n00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.880\nthem to have access to even\na custom object like commissions.\n\n71\n00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.390\nMaybe you don't want everyone to have\naccess to seeing this commission records\n\n72\n00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.780\nor object details.\n\n73\n00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.930\nSo, you can restrict it at this page here.\n\n74\n00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.900\nNow this Page Profile,\nonce you get into a profile page,\n\n75\n00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.290\na profile detail page, it's extensive.\n\n76\n00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.450\nThere's a lot of changes\nyou can make here.\n\n77\n00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.810\nBut I'll start out with a very high level,\nwhat those settings are.\n\n78\n00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.290\nAnd you know more or less where to go.\n\n79\n00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.820\nA lot of questions on the exam\nare gonna pertain to profiles.\n\n80\n00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.090\nIt's gonna ask you some tricky\nmultiple selection questions.\n\n81\n00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.800\nAn example of one is what\nshould a system admin\n\n82\n00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.160\ndo when they need to lock down app access?\n\n83\n00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.250\nWhere do they go?\n\n84\n00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.070\nIs it record types?\n\n85\n00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.410\nAnd this is where it starts getting\n\n86\n00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.129\nchallenging if you don't know\nthe difference between profiles and\n\n87\n00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:11.840\nrole hierarchies and\npermission sets and sharing rules.\n\n88\n00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.510\nAll of these are combined in this\ncategory on the exam itself.\n\n89\n00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.550\nSo, in that question,\nwhere do you go when you want to restrict\n\n90\n00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.920\naccess to a third-party\napp that was installed?\n\n91\n00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.400\nYou're not gonna go to the role hierarchy.\n\n92\n00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.040\nThat's just gonna show you\naccess to the records you're in.\n\n93\n00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.710\nYou're gonna go to the profile itself.\n\n94\n00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.900\nAnd that's where you can open\nup the access to those apps and\n\n95\n00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.340\neverything you want them to see and\nhave access to.\n\n96\n00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.900\nSo we'll get down there in the bottom,\n\n97\n00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.090\nbut that's just an example of one of\nthe questions that are asked on the test.\n\n98\n00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.160\nSo here on the profile detail page,\nyou have the license you're in,\n\n99\n00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.620\nbasic name, created by, modified.\n\n100\n00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.020\nBut right now,\nanother point is we're in a standard user.\n\n101\n00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.050\nSo if I were to hit edit at this point,\njust to this standard user\n\n102\n00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.780\nprofile that Salesforce gives you, there\naren't really any changes I can make.\n\n103\n00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.819\nAside from, let me x this out.\n\n104\n00:06:11.754 --> 00:06:16.051\nChanging the defaults on some\nof the custom app settings,\n\n105\n00:06:16.051 --> 00:06:17.810\nthe tab settings here.\n\n106\n00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.960\nSo you can change just at this\npoint from the standard user,\n\n107\n00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.130\nthe default on the tabs itself.\n\n108\n00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.970\nThis is just here.\n\n109\n00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.960\nSo not a whole lot of\ncustomizations into any of these\n\n110\n00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.860\nadministrative permissions here.\n\n111\n00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.920\nYou can't make any changes.\n\n112\n00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.700\nSo what we like to do as we're setting\nthings up, that's about it as far as, and\n\n113\n00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.750\nthen these changes to the password policy.\n\n114\n00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.740\nThose are the only changes you can make.\n\n115\n00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:50.180\nBut a lot of the requests that we need\nto do live within these check boxes and\n\n116\n00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.520\nthese settings here.\n\n117\n00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.770\nWhat I like to do is clone the profile,\nso I am going to go back, or Cancel, and\n\n118\n00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.100\nget back to the page we were on.\n\n119\n00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.200\nAnd, I'm going to hit Clone.\n\n120\n00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.385\nAnd usually,\nlet's say I work with Cloud Creations so\n\n121\n00:07:04.385 --> 00:07:08.030\nI'm gonna use Cloud Creations\nstandard user.\n\n122\n00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.260\nUsually I like to use a company name and\nthen just attach standard user at the end.\n\n123\n00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.990\nThis way I know what\nprofile I'm cloning from.\n\n124\n00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.990\nAnd I'm gonna hit Save.\n\n125\n00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:20.270\nAnd it's just gonna take all those same\nrequirements that a standard user has.\n\n126\n00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:25.230\nAnd now that it's a custom profile,\nand you can see that by the check box,\n\n127\n00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:28.560\nnow you can make changes to\nall those other settings.\n\n128\n00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.480\nYou can add a description too,\nas you start building profiles.\n\n129\n00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.140\nAnd again best practice is you don't wanna\ncreate numerous amounts of profiles,\n\n130\n00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.550\nyou wanna keep it at the minimum\nlevel that you can, and\n\n131\n00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.460\nthen you open it up with permission sets.\n\n132\n00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.790\nSo, custom app settings.\n\n133\n00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.330\nThis is where you can check, for\n\n134\n00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.320\nmy standard user they shouldn't\nhave access to the call center.\n\n135\n00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:57.201\nFor my standard sales user, standard\nmarketing user standard support user.\n\n136\n00:07:57.201 --> 00:08:02.369\nThis is all part of the sales and\nservice cloud that is covered on the exam.\n\n137\n00:08:02.369 --> 00:08:05.413\nSo tab settings,\nsame thing that we saw earlier,\n\n138\n00:08:05.413 --> 00:08:08.830\nis you can change your defaults to hidden,\noff, or on.\n\n139\n00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.560\nAnd you can see that you have\nthe level to change this for\n\n140\n00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.310\nevery object within Salesforce.\n\n141\n00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.080\nAnd then, your administrative permissions.\n\n142\n00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.680\nNow this can get real detailed here.\n\n143\n00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.280\nSometimes, as you can see,\nthere's too many fields on the page.\n\n144\n00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.190\nEven I don't know sometimes\nwhere to navigate, and\n\n145\n00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:33.100\nmy best guess is I control-F, or I find\nit and search for what I'm looking for.\n\n146\n00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:39.050\nAnd maybe it's a Salesforce 1, and\ni'm trying to make changes there too.\n\n147\n00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.410\nSometimes, I just have to\nuse that to find it here.\n\n148\n00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:43.690\nBut just to give you a kind of example,\n\n149\n00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.510\nsome of the changes you can make,\nbecause you can make changes to.\n\n150\n00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:52.200\nCan this user create profiles,\nI'm sorry, create reports or dashboards?\n\n151\n00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:56.430\nDo they have the option\nto manage CRM content?\n\n152\n00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:01.100\nIf you had a knowledge license,\ncan they manage Salesforce knowledge?\n\n153\n00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.950\nHere's an example of\nour security settings.\n\n154\n00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.390\nManage sharing, does this profile and\n\n155\n00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:12.870\neveryone that's assigned this profile,\nwill they have access to managed sharing?\n\n156\n00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:17.610\nAnd again, you can see the dashboard\nfolders, and report folders.\n\n157\n00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.650\nThis little help icon will\ngive you more details,\n\n158\n00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.030\nif you're not sure exactly what it does.\n\n159\n00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:27.750\nBut as a system admin, I think it's\nimportant to go and spend some time, and\n\n160\n00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.230\ngo into each one of these, and\n\n161\n00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:34.470\nknow what level of control you\ncan deal with in a profile.\n\n162\n00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.740\nAnd this way, when you're asked of it,\nor you have to make suggestions, or\n\n163\n00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.630\nif you have to take the exam, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n164\n00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.400\n&gt;&gt; You need to know what\n\n165\n00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.709\nyou can do and where.\n\n166\n00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.560\nSo this lives within here, manage users.\n\n167\n00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.810\nAnd we're just gonna keep going through,\n\n168\n00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.790\nand we're just gonna note some\nones that we change often.\n\n169\n00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.500\nSo billing, business hours.\n\n170\n00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.550\nAnd then some of these, you can see,\nare checked by default.\n\n171\n00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:01.010\nSo you have view help link,\nyou can't make changes on that,\n\n172\n00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:05.540\nbut the Salesforce outbound messaging,\nif that's something that you utilize,\n\n173\n00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:10.210\nby default it's checked,\nthat they can for a standard user.\n\n174\n00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:15.060\nSo, just scrolling down to the bottom, you\nalso have just general user permission.\n\n175\n00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.020\nSo what do they have permission to do?\n\n176\n00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:23.300\nMarketing users, if it was a profile for\na marketing user,\n\n177\n00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.600\nthey have the check boxes to manage leads.\n\n178\n00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.010\nBut we're in a standard user,\nso we're not gonna see that.\n\n179\n00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:33.670\nWe'll go through, there's a few more\nstandard different profile types.\n\n180\n00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:38.590\nLike marketing would have more\naccess to creating leads,\n\n181\n00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.630\nwhereas in sales user, you don't.\n\n182\n00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.370\nMarketing user has\naccess to imports leads.\n\n183\n00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:48.360\nSo there's just a few more\noptions out the door.\n\n184\n00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.540\nBut, you can make it more\ncustomized if you wanna open up\n\n185\n00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:54.690\nthat profile to have more access.\n\n186\n00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:58.012\nSo as I'm going through this,\nyou can see some of the options here.\n\n187\n00:10:58.012 --> 00:11:03.780\nReports is something that's requested\noften, and then mass emails and edit task.\n\n188\n00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:09.030\nBut, another place to go to here for\nis the standard object permissions.\n\n189\n00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:12.090\nSo this is the place\nto go to to open up or\n\n190\n00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.770\nrestrict access to view the object itself.\n\n191\n00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.610\nMaybe you created a custom object.\n\n192\n00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:21.870\nThis is where it would live, here,\nand you can control who has accessed,\n\n193\n00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.700\nbased off the profile, to see it.\n\n194\n00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.290\nSo, it's not individual based.\n\n195\n00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.630\nIt's based off the profile.\n\n196\n00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:33.480\nAnd you can change it, and you have the\noption of it being read only, create only,\n\n197\n00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.000\nread and edit, delete.\n\n198\n00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.970\nAnd if it's view all or modify all,\nyou have those two other options here.\n\n199\n00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.890\nRight now, for a standard user\nyou can see, and this is also\n\n200\n00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:48.100\na question that I have seen often, what\ndoes a standard user have access to do?\n\n201\n00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.510\nAnd it can be real specific.\n\n202\n00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:53.770\nWhat does a standard user have\naccess to do for accounts?\n\n203\n00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.890\nAnd so, it's really good\nto spend some time on here.\n\n204\n00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.000\nMaybe create some flash cards,\nand know an account for\n\n205\n00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.270\na standard user can do read,\ncreate, edit, delete.\n\n206\n00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.880\nAnd some of these questions,\nagain, are multi-select.\n\n207\n00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.700\nSo if you do not select one,\nthe question is wrong.\n\n208\n00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.840\nSo it's marked wrong.\n\n209\n00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.250\nSo you may think you have a good\ngeneral or broad knowledge of security,\n\n210\n00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.740\nbut those questions can be real tricky and\nreal specific.\n\n211\n00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.330\nAnd it gets this granular here,\nas far as those questions go.\n\n212\n00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:30.350\nSo spend some time, go through into\neach object as far as security goes.\n\n213\n00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:34.010\nAnd know, more or less,\nwhat standard users get for, I mean for\n\n214\n00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:35.720\nstandard profiles.\n\n215\n00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:40.560\nSo.\n&gt;&gt; So you can clone the built-in profile.\n\n216\n00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.100\nCan you also clone profiles\nmaybe that you have created?\n\n217\n00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.290\nYeah, definitely and so\nyou can have a whole list.\n\n218\n00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.260\nSo, this is just cloning from\nexisting standard profiles.\n\n219\n00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.509\nSo, we can just even\nstart at the real basics.\n\n220\n00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:56.220\nI always use my quick\nlinks to navigate back.\n\n221\n00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.175\nAnd you can simply even\nclone anything here.\n\n222\n00:12:59.175 --> 00:13:02.140\nYou'll have that clone\nbutton on the homepage.\n\n223\n00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.450\nAnd going back,\nyou have your list views here.\n\n224\n00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.030\nBut you can also select new profile.\n\n225\n00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:10.525\nAnd it's asking you, I'm sorry,\ndid I click clone profile?\n\n226\n00:13:10.525 --> 00:13:11.210\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n227\n00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:13.040\n&gt;&gt; New profile up here.\n\n228\n00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.110\nAnd it looks like it's asking to clone.\n\n229\n00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:17.100\nBut we don't wanna clone.\n\n230\n00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.920\nWe want to start new.\n\n231\n00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.830\nSo you do have to select\n&gt;&gt; Kind of a starting point?\n\n232\n00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.320\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, starting point here.\n\n233\n00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.490\nSo, same steps, and it's gonna take\nyou to the next part right there.\n\n234\n00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.910\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; Seems like that clone option will be\n\n235\n00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:32.780\nreally handy, because the profiles can\nbe so granular with the permissions.\n\n236\n00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.410\nAnd if you've got another group of\npeople that needs very similar access,\n\n237\n00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:38.590\nslight differences,\nI don't have to start from scratch.\n\n238\n00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.630\nI can clone my existing profile,\ntweak it a little bit, rename it,\n\n239\n00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:42.510\nand we're good to go.\n\n240\n00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.340\n&gt;&gt; Right, right.\n\n241\n00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.980\nAnd so some of these,\nas you were saying here,\n\n242\n00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:48.380\nsome of these profiles, going through\nsome of the most common ones,\n\n243\n00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.240\nwe talked about standard user, and\nwe talked about the System admin.\n\n244\n00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.460\nWe talked a little bit about\nthe marketing user, but\n\n245\n00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.980\nsome other ones would be the read only's.\n\n246\n00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:01.204\nSo maybe you have a group of users that\nneed to just be able to see the data and\n\n247\n00:14:01.204 --> 00:14:02.870\nnot make changes.\n\n248\n00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.200\nSo you have the read only.\n\n249\n00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.340\nWe'd only assign them\nthe read only profile here.\n\n250\n00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.850\nAnd you can see that.\n\n251\n00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.660\nAnd to do that,\nyou would go into the user itself.\n\n252\n00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.290\nIf you went into the profile,\ntoo, you saw view all users.\n\n253\n00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.230\nYou can see the group of\nusers that are assigned it.\n\n254\n00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:24.380\nBut usually, I'm going on a per\nuser basis, and I'm looking at,\n\n255\n00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:28.540\nsay chatter expert was a person,\nand I can see to my right.\n\n256\n00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:33.230\nOkay, he has this type of profile, but\nhe really should have this profile.\n\n257\n00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.800\nMaybe there is a promotion, and\nnow he has more access, and\n\n258\n00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.350\nmaybe someone was granted\na promotion to be a system admin.\n\n259\n00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.340\nYou go into the user profile itself.\n\n260\n00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:47.250\nAnd you, if this was changing from\na chatter free to a Salesforce license,\n\n261\n00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:48.950\nthe only way to do that,\n\n262\n00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:52.910\nyour profiles are only given based\noff of the license that you have.\n\n263\n00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.850\nSo I can't change them to\na standard user at this point.\n\n264\n00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.260\nI would have to change his\nlicense to a Salesforce license.\n\n265\n00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.760\nAnd then I can select from my\nlist of licenses available.\n\n266\n00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.740\nSo we have read only.\n\n267\n00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:10.910\nSo now, I want this chatter expert to\nbe read-only on my Salesforce records.\n\n268\n00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:15.470\nOr his privileges, more privileges, and\nnow I bumped him up to a system admin.\n\n269\n00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:18.570\nWe needed to hire another one and\nwe have a second system admin.\n\n270\n00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:19.820\nYou just make those changes here.\n\n271\n00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:24.590\nAnd all the changes within that\nprofile are now, once you hit save,\n\n272\n00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.955\nare now given to this user,\nto anyone assigned this profile.\n\n273\n00:15:31.663 --> 00:15:35.688\nAs I go into the profiles,\nback again, you can see,\n\n274\n00:15:35.688 --> 00:15:38.720\nlet's go back into our standard user.\n\n275\n00:15:41.039 --> 00:15:46.070\nOr let's go into, yes,\ndon't think I saved the other one.\n\n276\n00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.440\nSo we're gonna go back into the standard\nuser, and just show you further down.\n\n277\n00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.933\nSo we went through the tab settings.\n\n278\n00:15:50.933 --> 00:15:56.433\nWe went through the objects and\nanother point to this where a lot of\n\n279\n00:15:56.433 --> 00:16:01.936\nchanges are record-type settings and\nfield-level security.\n\n280\n00:16:01.936 --> 00:16:05.758\nSo, you can also make changes here as\nto what record types that you made.\n\n281\n00:16:05.758 --> 00:16:11.160\nSo Most common scenario maybe have\na B2B side and then a B2C side.\n\n282\n00:16:12.288 --> 00:16:15.290\nAnd as you're creating an account or\nleads,\n\n283\n00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.825\nyou have two different record types.\n\n284\n00:16:17.825 --> 00:16:21.510\nYou can have the record type for\nyour accounts business to business and\n\n285\n00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:24.935\nthen you can have a record type for\nyour B2C side of customers.\n\n286\n00:16:24.935 --> 00:16:29.535\nMaybe we have different sales reps only\nresponsible for those territories,\n\n287\n00:16:29.535 --> 00:16:33.925\nso when you create those\ndifferent record types,\n\n288\n00:16:33.925 --> 00:16:36.670\nthis is just high level view\nof record types in Salesforce.\n\n289\n00:16:37.745 --> 00:16:40.325\nYou can only see certain page layouts,\n\n290\n00:16:40.325 --> 00:16:44.520\ncertain fields that are applicable\nto he record type you're in.\n\n291\n00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:49.416\nSo at this point, if I have a sales user,\nmaybe they don't need to see a sales\n\n292\n00:16:49.416 --> 00:16:53.720\nB2Bs or maybe they don't need to see B2C\nrecord types, or even see the option.\n\n293\n00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.880\nSo at this point, this is where you\nrestrict access to the record type\n\n294\n00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:02.490\nitself which then within\nit holds the page layout.\n\n295\n00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:05.420\nSo that's for that section here.\n\n296\n00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.990\nAnd as we went through all the admin\npermissions that they can do.\n\n297\n00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:13.310\nAnd then a general user permissions\nthat we went kinda through.\n\n298\n00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:19.970\nAnd now you go through at the bottom and\nyou have the options for session settings.\n\n299\n00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.470\nSo for these group of users,\nshould they time out after 15,\n\n300\n00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.000\n32 hours [LAUGH] of inactivity,\nyou can make the changes there.\n\n301\n00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.120\nAnd then password policies,\nhow much do you wanna time to change or\n\n302\n00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.960\nrenew their password.\n\n303\n00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.590\nPassword length, you have some options\nthere, this is all based off the profile.\n\n304\n00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.850\nSo, that can change for\ndifferent types of users.\n\n305\n00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:44.250\nIf you want more, control over that.\n\n306\n00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:47.970\nAnd then, in the profile itself\nis where you can see the changes\n\n307\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:49.900\nto the log in hours.\n\n308\n00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:54.560\nSo you can have your options to\nchange from only be able to access or\n\n309\n00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.770\nbe logged in from eight to five,\nMonday through Friday.\n\n310\n00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:02.640\nIf they're trying to log in on a Saturday,\nthey don't\n\n311\n00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:08.068\nhave access again in this cloud based, so\nthey could access from their computer.\n\n312\n00:18:08.068 --> 00:18:12.770\nIf you wanna even restrict that and have\nthem only able to access their computers\n\n313\n00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:18.890\nfrom the company itself, then you can\nlog in for a group of users by profile.\n\n314\n00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:23.990\nHere in this section where you log\nthose IP ranges at the profile level.\n\n315\n00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:28.970\nAnd then a lot of options as far\nas what apex classes can they see,\n\n316\n00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.030\nwhat Visualforce pages can they see.\n\n317\n00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:35.025\nMaybe there were some custom\ndevelopment that you did,\n\n318\n00:18:35.025 --> 00:18:37.915\nI'm the only one viewable to a profile.\n\n319\n00:18:37.915 --> 00:18:42.022\nThis is where you kind of change\nthose permissions and access there.\n\n320\n00:18:44.123 --> 00:18:51.086\nSo that gives you a good idea as far\nas what you can do with the profiles,\n\n321\n00:18:51.086 --> 00:18:56.294\nwhat changes you can make as\nfar as what a user can do.\n\n322\n00:18:56.294 --> 00:19:02.420\nNow to open up access,\nI suggested keep it at a bare minimum.\n\n323\n00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:06.920\nOkay, what do I do if I need\nto give one user permission or\n\n324\n00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.880\ngive someone a permission set.\n\n325\n00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:15.056\nSo you wanna go over here to manage\nusers and give them a permission set.\n\n326\n00:19:15.056 --> 00:19:21.756\nSo maybe my example, someone fell into\na profile where they were only able to,\n\n327\n00:19:21.756 --> 00:19:27.750\nlet say they can't setup reports, so they\nwere part of a standard profile and report\n\n328\n00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:32.220\nmanagement was not up of the wall to\nthat group of users within that profile.\n\n329\n00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:36.500\nBut maybe there's one person who sits in\nthere that I want them to have permission,\n\n330\n00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.790\nso you create these permission sets and\nwe have one living here,\n\n331\n00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:46.730\nthere aren't any by default it create us\none previously called permission sets.\n\n332\n00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:50.400\nI will make more descriptive but\nyou'll also have a description too.\n\n333\n00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.140\nBecause you can have a long\nlist of permission sets.\n\n334\n00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:57.770\nAnd of course since Salesforce,\nany object page has a list view here.\n\n335\n00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:00.350\nYou're kinda sorting\nthrough some of these.\n\n336\n00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:04.940\nAnd in this permission set right here, it\nwill give you that list and it will show\n\n337\n00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:09.100\nyou the list of options that you can\nmake at the profile level that we saw.\n\n338\n00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.900\nSo all those options and\n\n339\n00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:16.850\nfields that we saw to make at an\nadministrative level you can assign here.\n\n340\n00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.790\nSo I would select who do\nI wanna assign it to?\n\n341\n00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:21.080\nWhat user?\n\n342\n00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:25.620\nWas the permission and\nI can select and search off that list.\n\n343\n00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.070\nAnd in this one right here,\nI just wanna give\n\n344\n00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:32.010\nsomeone permission to create report\nfolders or just create reports.\n\n345\n00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:33.880\nThere's a lot of options there.\n\n346\n00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.770\nIt's gonna ask for\nthe license first, and then name it,\n\n347\n00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:41.640\nand make those changes and\nassign the profile here.\n\n348\n00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.490\nSo if you wanna manage assignments,\n\n349\n00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.270\nit's gonna take you to adding\nthe assignment, itself.\n\n350\n00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:52.050\nSo right now we're still living within\nthat one, who are we gonna assign it to,\n\n351\n00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:53.400\nat this point?\n\n352\n00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.500\nAnd then me, I'm a system admin so\nI may not need it but\n\n353\n00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:02.840\nI can assign it to our example of a\nchatter expert, and assign this one here.\n\n354\n00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.130\nSo If there is an error,\nwhich is a great way to troubleshoot.\n\n355\n00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:07.300\nYou'll see why.\n\n356\n00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:11.400\nSo this one is example cuz we can't\nassign it to a chatter expert.\n\n357\n00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.370\nChatter expert is not\na Salesforce license.\n\n358\n00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.740\nSo they have to have\nthe right license to do so.\n\n359\n00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.900\nAnd most of the time it's\ngonna be a Salesforce license.\n\n360\n00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.540\nAnd then, they'll have access to be\nassigned any type of permission set.\n\n361\n00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.680\nSo this is happening cuz\nwe're in a development org.\n\n362\n00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.030\nBut as long as they\nhave the right license,\n\n363\n00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.402\nyou can assign them\nthe right permission set.\n\n364\n00:21:34.402 --> 00:21:36.389\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic,\n\n365\n00:21:36.389 --> 00:21:40.900\nare we limited to one permission set or\ncan we start combining those?\n\n366\n00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a great question.\n\n367\n00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.810\nSo you can have as many permission sets.\n\n368\n00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:49.171\nI can grant you as many\npermission sets as I need.\n\n369\n00:21:49.171 --> 00:21:50.419\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n370\n00:21:50.419 --> 00:21:51.170\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n371\n00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.405\nWell, Felicia again another great\nlook there at controlling access.\n\n372\n00:21:54.405 --> 00:21:57.385\nSecurity access,\nobviously a very important part\n\n373\n00:21:57.385 --> 00:22:02.665\nin our administration of our org within\nSalesforce, as well as for the exam.\n\n374\n00:22:02.665 --> 00:22:04.215\nMake sure you take Felicia's advice there.\n\n375\n00:22:04.215 --> 00:22:07.877\nStudy up on those, lot of permissions\ninvolved with those profiles right?\n\n376\n00:22:07.877 --> 00:22:09.827\nTake a look at that standard user profile.\n\n377\n00:22:09.827 --> 00:22:12.557\nGet familiar with what level of access\n\n378\n00:22:12.557 --> 00:22:15.877\nyou're gonna be giving somebody when\nyou assign that profile to them.\n\n379\n00:22:15.877 --> 00:22:16.977\nSo we thank you for that Felicia,\n\n380\n00:22:16.977 --> 00:22:19.277\nwe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n381\n00:22:19.277 --> 00:22:22.257\nSigning off for

00:00:08.271\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.271 --> 00:00:12.200\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.942\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.942 --> 00:00:17.099\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.422\nAnd today, we are doing our\nSalesforce Certified Administrator.\n\n8\n00:00:20.422 --> 00:00:24.760\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\nfocusing in on lead management.\n\n9\n00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.148\nAnd here to lend her expertise in\nthe area is Ms. Felicia Duarte.\n\n10\n00:00:28.148 --> 00:00:29.338\nWelcome back, Felicia.\n\n11\n00:00:29.338 --> 00:00:30.032\n&gt;&gt; Great, thanks.\n\n12\n00:00:30.032 --> 00:00:31.106\nHello, everyone.\n\n13\n00:00:31.106 --> 00:00:35.830\nSo in this topic, this episode,\nI'm gonna cover lead management.\n\n14\n00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.240\nThis is covered in the exam,\nthey're gonna ask you questions.\n\n15\n00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.830\nExpect to see questions on lead\nassignment rules, lead queues,\n\n16\n00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.260\nconverting leads, basic functionality of\na lead, what the fields within the leads.\n\n17\n00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.654\nSo I'll start there and I'll start very\nhigh level as far as the lead homepage,\n\n18\n00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:55.696\nsome of the fields within the leads.\n\n19\n00:00:55.696 --> 00:01:00.256\nAnd we'll work our way all the way down\nto web to leads and creating web to lead.\n\n20\n00:01:00.256 --> 00:01:05.789\nSo let's navigate over here from our home\nscreen over unto the lead object itself.\n\n21\n00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.420\nNow there are some common misconceptions\nwithin Salesforce as what is a lead?\n\n22\n00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.030\nSo within the org it can be tricky,\n\n23\n00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.800\nit can be confusing as far\nas what's considered a lead.\n\n24\n00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.850\nA lead with Salesforce is\nan unqualified prospect.\n\n25\n00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.585\nSo you may have your leads or\na prospect sit in your leads and accounts.\n\n26\n00:01:28.585 --> 00:01:31.642\nYou might have an account type prospect,\nbut\n\n27\n00:01:31.642 --> 00:01:35.510\nyour leads are anyone you have yet\nto make a contact with.\n\n28\n00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.844\nThere's still at a qualifying status.\n\n29\n00:01:40.844 --> 00:01:42.694\nOr they went to a trade show and\n\n30\n00:01:42.694 --> 00:01:46.923\nthey collected 100 business cards\nthat you wanna holding tank.\n\n31\n00:01:46.923 --> 00:01:51.547\nAnd that's really what this is,\nreleases your holding tank of prospects,\n\n32\n00:01:51.547 --> 00:01:56.186\npeople you want to do business with,\npeople who wanna do business with you.\n\n33\n00:01:56.186 --> 00:02:00.014\nAnd once you qualified them, we're\ngoing to that we'll convert the lead.\n\n34\n00:02:00.014 --> 00:02:07.280\nSo from my lead page here, right now\nwe see a list of just recent leads.\n\n35\n00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.919\nStaying here at my homepage,\n\n36\n00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.138\nI can look at right now we're\nlooking at recently viewed.\n\n37\n00:02:12.138 --> 00:02:13.916\nBut these are my three options to change.\n\n38\n00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:16.891\nSo what are my leads recently created?\n\n39\n00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:18.599\nAnd as we discuss later on,\n\n40\n00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.446\nthis can be leads that are brought in\nfrom your website, from the web to lead.\n\n41\n00:02:23.446 --> 00:02:27.476\nMaybe they were imported, so you can\nsee list of recently created leads.\n\n42\n00:02:27.476 --> 00:02:31.609\nMaybe there's some leads that haven't\nbeen open into, your sitting in queue,\n\n43\n00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.875\nwhat am I unread leads and\nrecently viewed.\n\n44\n00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:38.697\nJust kind of your quick way to navigate\nthe last records you were working in.\n\n45\n00:02:38.697 --> 00:02:44.081\nSo if we go again to our list views here,\nwe have our choices of all open leads,\n\n46\n00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:49.290\nunread reads, recently viewed leads,\nleads that were created today.\n\n47\n00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.149\nAnd then you can continue to build on, and\n\n48\n00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:53.340\nbuild on and\ncreate these different less views.\n\n49\n00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.349\nSalesforce gives you a custom one and\ncustom two,\n\n50\n00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.576\nby I just create new views from here.\n\n51\n00:02:58.576 --> 00:03:04.071\nI just make descriptive as am naming them,\nso I know for myself or for the user's\n\n52\n00:03:04.071 --> 00:03:08.756\nhow to navigate and get into them if\nI break off the way I view my data.\n\n53\n00:03:08.756 --> 00:03:11.974\nSo once I hit into all\nof them leads right now,\n\n54\n00:03:11.974 --> 00:03:15.635\nI've only gone to an a developer\norg one lead here.\n\n55\n00:03:15.635 --> 00:03:19.694\nSo I'm not seeing the complete\nlist as we say in Salesforce,\n\n56\n00:03:19.694 --> 00:03:23.205\nyou wanna hit the Go with\nexclamation mark, the GO!\n\n57\n00:03:23.205 --> 00:03:26.351\nAnd then you'll see here's\nall your data here.\n\n58\n00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:30.074\nSo in this list view,\nI decided to see just lead status,\n\n59\n00:03:30.074 --> 00:03:34.117\nthat's what's important maybe\nto me as being a sales repm,\n\n60\n00:03:34.117 --> 00:03:37.550\nsome creative dates just\nbasic information here.\n\n61\n00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:43.560\nBut as I click into the lead record\nitself, let's use Kristen as the example.\n\n62\n00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.592\nBelow my chatter feed will see\nthe lead detail, then we'll see,\n\n63\n00:03:48.592 --> 00:03:54.280\nwe can double click here and make changes,\nit'll take us into Edit mode.\n\n64\n00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.612\nAnd for\nevery option Salesforce of to Edit mode.\n\n65\n00:03:56.612 --> 00:04:01.443\nSo you have tthis page here where I can\nstart double-clicking into the records and\n\n66\n00:04:01.443 --> 00:04:09.982\nif I were to update a mobile,\nYou can see the text changed to orange.\n\n67\n00:04:09.982 --> 00:04:13.863\nAs the fields start growing, and\nas you get further down the pages,\n\n68\n00:04:13.863 --> 00:04:17.964\njust know as you're in this Edit mode and\nas your entries are in orange.\n\n69\n00:04:17.964 --> 00:04:21.936\nYou gotta hit Save in order to save\nthe record, or you lose all your changes.\n\n70\n00:04:21.936 --> 00:04:26.569\nYour other option to make changes\nto a record, going back into it,\n\n71\n00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:27.989\nthe record itself.\n\n72\n00:04:27.989 --> 00:04:29.883\nYou can just hit Edit, and\n\n73\n00:04:29.883 --> 00:04:34.114\nit does look a little bit\ndifferent as far as the Edit mode.\n\n74\n00:04:34.114 --> 00:04:38.688\nAnd often I hear from users as we're\ndoing training, hey, the screen you were\n\n75\n00:04:38.688 --> 00:04:42.584\nlast in looks different than the edit\nscreen I was in, same thing.\n\n76\n00:04:42.584 --> 00:04:45.167\nYou can make the same changes,\nit just looks different and\n\n77\n00:04:45.167 --> 00:04:46.740\nthere's two ways to get there.\n\n78\n00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.170\nBut in Edit mode,\nthese are the changes you can make.\n\n79\n00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.260\nFor a lead out the box, and this is\na question I've seen on a test before.\n\n80\n00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.510\nLet me go back to my leads homepage and\ncreate a new lead.\n\n81\n00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.505\nThe required fields, and\nespecially when you're importing,\n\n82\n00:05:02.505 --> 00:05:04.198\nyou have to at least have a last name.\n\n83\n00:05:04.198 --> 00:05:07.346\nSo if you collected or purchased a list,\n\n84\n00:05:07.346 --> 00:05:13.230\nyou need to at least have a company\nname to associate it and a last name.\n\n85\n00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:19.202\nNow if it's people, and if your business\nis maybe financial services and\n\n86\n00:05:19.202 --> 00:05:24.327\nyour business are individuals and\nnot necessarily a company.\n\n87\n00:05:24.327 --> 00:05:27.440\nYou have persons accounts which\nwe will get to in a later topic.\n\n88\n00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.114\nBut sometimes company I named,\nif it's myself, I'm the individual.\n\n89\n00:05:31.114 --> 00:05:35.536\nI just name it Doherty Household,\nand Enter.\n\n90\n00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:38.434\nAnd there's different naming conventions\nthat you can use that works for\n\n91\n00:05:38.434 --> 00:05:40.499\nyour business, but\nthat's just an example of one.\n\n92\n00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:44.550\nAnd then here, the basic contact\ninformation that you can enter here.\n\n93\n00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.890\nSo you have to have last name,\ncompany, and lead status.\n\n94\n00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.283\nSo those are the required fields\nin order to save a lead record.\n\n95\n00:05:51.283 --> 00:05:54.709\nBy default,\nit will say open not contacted.\n\n96\n00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:59.625\nIt's good to know what the values\nare in these picklist fields.\n\n97\n00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:01.202\nSo this way you know what changes to me.\n\n98\n00:06:01.202 --> 00:06:05.748\nBut you have open up contacted,\nworking contacted.\n\n99\n00:06:05.748 --> 00:06:08.585\nAnd then you have close converted and\nclose not converted,\n\n100\n00:06:08.585 --> 00:06:10.465\nonce you have the conversion process.\n\n101\n00:06:10.465 --> 00:06:15.414\nBut you can certainly add to these\nfields as a system admin, where and\n\n102\n00:06:15.414 --> 00:06:18.159\nhow to create the custom fields here.\n\n103\n00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:22.697\nBut that's a real general basic\nfields that you need to know.\n\n104\n00:06:22.697 --> 00:06:27.191\nAnd you'll also be utilizing campaigns\nwhen you are configuring leads and\n\n105\n00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:28.555\ncampaigns together.\n\n106\n00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:32.896\nYou have industries and\nsome of these fields may not be needed.\n\n107\n00:06:32.896 --> 00:06:37.248\nMaybe you don't need to collect this\ninformation at this point in order to\n\n108\n00:06:37.248 --> 00:06:37.888\nqualify.\n\n109\n00:06:37.888 --> 00:06:40.009\nMaybe you have a longer process, and\n\n110\n00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:44.700\nhere are a few questions that you need\nto know before you qualify the lead.\n\n111\n00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.664\nAnd within a lead itself,\nyou can collect certain point of contact.\n\n112\n00:06:48.664 --> 00:06:51.215\nSo maybe wanna create some activities,\n\n113\n00:06:51.215 --> 00:06:56.100\nmaybe there's initial meeting that you\nhave in the qualification process.\n\n114\n00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.960\nAnd all of that were shown\nActivity History and\n\n115\n00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.800\nthere's emails that are continuously\nsent out before they are even converted.\n\n116\n00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.376\nSo let's walk through the process\nof converting a lead.\n\n117\n00:07:08.376 --> 00:07:12.786\nSo let's use Ms.\nKristen as our example in conversion.\n\n118\n00:07:12.786 --> 00:07:17.194\nSo right now, she's working contacted.\n\n119\n00:07:17.194 --> 00:07:18.061\nI can select,\n\n120\n00:07:18.061 --> 00:07:23.350\nthese are my options here within\nthe lead record to undefined duplicates.\n\n121\n00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.344\nIn this example,\nwe made this applicable to share.\n\n122\n00:07:27.344 --> 00:07:29.668\nSo if I wanted to share this record.\n\n123\n00:07:29.668 --> 00:07:33.297\nRight now I hold access,\nI am the lead owner of this record.\n\n124\n00:07:33.297 --> 00:07:37.473\nBut I want to share it with another user,\na group of users here.\n\n125\n00:07:37.473 --> 00:07:42.507\nSo I can do so here by clicking\nthe Share button and adding based of\n\n126\n00:07:42.507 --> 00:07:47.650\npublic groups, roles, roles and\nsubordinates and users here.\n\n127\n00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.635\nSo I don't wanna share this record,\nI just wanna convert.\n\n128\n00:07:52.635 --> 00:07:55.604\nSo if I wanted to clone,\nI can clone or edit.\n\n129\n00:07:55.604 --> 00:07:59.619\nBut I wanna Convert this record and\nat the conversion process, so\n\n130\n00:07:59.619 --> 00:08:02.473\nwhen you're converting, You are creating.\n\n131\n00:08:02.473 --> 00:08:04.389\nYou have the company name and\nyou have the name.\n\n132\n00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:08.070\nSo you are creating an account and\na contact.\n\n133\n00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.700\nThis is if it's not a person's account.\n\n134\n00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.280\nThis is standard Salesforce.\n\n135\n00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.400\nSo I'm not confusing anyone,\n\n136\n00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.140\na person's account is a feature that has\nto be enabled and cannot be taken back.\n\n137\n00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:22.560\nSo we're just talking strictly out of\nthe box CRM, leads accounts contacts.\n\n138\n00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.600\nSo a lead will create\nan account in contact.\n\n139\n00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.930\nRight here, you have the choice,\nhey I think this might, I need to for\n\n140\n00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:34.140\na company name instead\nof Athena Home Products.\n\n141\n00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:39.020\nNow, if this was a lead where the company\nalready existed in that scenario, it would\n\n142\n00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:43.720\nfind that company name and say, hey do\nyou wanna match it to this company name?\n\n143\n00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.790\nOr do you wanna create a new one?\n\n144\n00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:52.670\nIn this one, and we can also search too, I\ndon't see any accounts to associate it to.\n\n145\n00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.880\nAnd this is where you also wanna be,\nmake sure you really know your data and\n\n146\n00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.862\neven on the spelling.\n\n147\n00:08:57.862 --> 00:08:59.618\nMaybe the company name does exist and\n\n148\n00:08:59.618 --> 00:09:03.370\nthere's a small A somewhere in there or\nsomething.\n\n149\n00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:08.842\nYou can search here and I did change\nthis in a previous episode to private.\n\n150\n00:09:08.842 --> 00:09:10.540\n[LAUGH] So I cannot see everything.\n\n151\n00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.650\nBut if I had access to see the rest of the\ndata within Salesforce I can search and\n\n152\n00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.600\nsee a list of all the accounts.\n\n153\n00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.460\nBut right now let's say there\nis no Athena Home Products.\n\n154\n00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.000\nSo I'm going to create a new account.\n\n155\n00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.510\nYou can see that here.\n\n156\n00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:29.160\nAnd maybe as I've had conversations with\nher, I've identified an opportunity.\n\n157\n00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.819\nSo it will automatically\ncreate a conversion\n\n158\n00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:37.157\nby default an account,\ncontact and an opportunity.\n\n159\n00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:43.070\nBut if I decided there is no opportunity\nI just want to create the contact and\n\n160\n00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:46.630\naccount, I'm gonna select to\nnot create a new opportunity.\n\n161\n00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.340\nSo at this point of conversion,\njust creating an account and contact.\n\n162\n00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:54.010\nNow there is some other options\nto when your converting.\n\n163\n00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.720\nNow I know it does,\nit's highlighted in red, and\n\n164\n00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.080\nred in Salesforce means\nthis is a required field.\n\n165\n00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.680\nAt this point it's not required.\n\n166\n00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.990\nIt's only if you're going\nto be entering a task.\n\n167\n00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:07.630\nSo you dont have to create a task and\nI won't to show you.\n\n168\n00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:11.230\nBut if I started entering some subject and\n\n169\n00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.700\nthese are the points\nhere that are required.\n\n170\n00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.650\nBut we're not gonna create a task for\nthis individual and\n\n171\n00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:22.960\nthe reminder part here pertains to\nthe task if you decided to create one.\n\n172\n00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.969\nSo I'm gonna create, and I'm not gonna\ncheck this, cuz we wanna see what is\n\n173\n00:10:26.969 --> 00:10:30.688\nan account contac,t an opportunity,\nlook like once you convert it.\n\n174\n00:10:30.688 --> 00:10:34.230\nSo let's convert.\n\n175\n00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:40.120\nAnd if you want to notify who the owner\nis then notify the owner that\n\n176\n00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.710\nthey have a new account assigned to them\nyou can send an email to the owner here.\n\n177\n00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:48.510\nAnd they will receive an email\nthat they have been assigned and\n\n178\n00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.810\nthat this lead has been converted.\n\n179\n00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.400\nSo now as you see we're in\nour account object here.\n\n180\n00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:59.290\nAnd if we scroll down further in our\nrelated list, we're gonna see contacts.\n\n181\n00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:01.939\nAnd we're gonna see Kristen and\n\n182\n00:11:01.939 --> 00:11:07.150\nwith the opportunity that we created,\nAthena Home Products.\n\n183\n00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:13.434\nNow it's good for a system admin to\nknow that you can do these mappings and\n\n184\n00:11:13.434 --> 00:11:17.362\nwe'll navigate over to\nour lead setup page.\n\n185\n00:11:17.362 --> 00:11:19.924\nBut you can create mappings between,\n\n186\n00:11:19.924 --> 00:11:25.285\nif you were to create custom fields in the\nlead and custom fields in the account or\n\n187\n00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:28.665\ncontact, where that should\nmap to within setup.\n\n188\n00:11:28.665 --> 00:11:32.601\nSo, I'd like, and\nI've had this enabled, and\n\n189\n00:11:32.601 --> 00:11:36.380\npart of my user interface\nis this Force.com.\n\n190\n00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:40.675\nIt's my fast way to go up to the setup\nmenu rather than having to go to setup and\n\n191\n00:11:40.675 --> 00:11:44.480\nkind of find the object and\nother places to go.\n\n192\n00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.660\nSo View Fields would take me\nright into the set-up page.\n\n193\n00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:50.970\nAnd before I go there,\n\n194\n00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.980\nlet's just go through what some\nof the standard fields are.\n\n195\n00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.961\nWe went through what the required fields\nare, which are company name and last name,\n\n196\n00:11:59.961 --> 00:12:04.430\nbut this gives you an idea of what those\nfields are, what the field name is, and\n\n197\n00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:06.410\nwhat the data type is.\n\n198\n00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:11.180\nYou don't have a lot of changes\nyou can make here at this point.\n\n199\n00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:16.770\nBut if it's a picklist, so let's say lead\nsource, and sometimes this is confusing.\n\n200\n00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:21.010\nThis is only to change the description\nof the name here or add Help text.\n\n201\n00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:25.660\nBut if you wanna make changes to\nthe actual values within any of a standard\n\n202\n00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.970\nfield picklist,\nyou wanna click into the field name first.\n\n203\n00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.900\nSo let's say, lead source.\n\n204\n00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.490\nA lot of the times, for\n\n205\n00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:41.070\nclients, the values that Salesforce\ngives is not one that they use.\n\n206\n00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.940\nSo, and there's values that\nyou certainly can add to it.\n\n207\n00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.380\nSo right now we're just in\nthe field Lead Source here.\n\n208\n00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:53.210\nYou can add field dependencies,\nso if there's another pick\n\n209\n00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:56.200\nlist field that you wanna tie together,\nyou can do that here.\n\n210\n00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.700\nSo you wanna create the dependency.\n\n211\n00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.760\nAt this point, there's validation\nrules just to this field.\n\n212\n00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.290\nThis is the place to create\nthose validations, and\n\n213\n00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.380\nthen if you wanna edit the the pick list.\n\n214\n00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.390\nSo let's say we had existing data.\n\n215\n00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.820\nAnd it was web.\n\n216\n00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.910\nAnd I want to edit this here.\n\n217\n00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.990\nI don't know, say website.\n\n218\n00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.500\nActually I think this\nis a value that exists.\n\n219\n00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.907\nAnd you can change and you go in to\nthe specific value, as you can see here,\n\n220\n00:13:28.907 --> 00:13:30.986\nto make default for any pick list.\n\n221\n00:13:30.986 --> 00:13:32.908\nAnd that's for\nany pick list filled within Salesforce.\n\n222\n00:13:32.908 --> 00:13:37.860\nSo I can change and edit so\nit doesn't look like we had a website.\n\n223\n00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.170\nSo I can change and\nedit the name of it, which is fine.\n\n224\n00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:44.360\nBut if you start, let's say,\ndeactivate phone.\n\n225\n00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.609\nYou can even, for center fields,\ndeactivate or delete.\n\n226\n00:13:46.609 --> 00:13:48.440\nLet's deactivate the phone inquiry.\n\n227\n00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:55.830\nIt's gonna place them in an inactive\nfield, but it still exists there.\n\n228\n00:13:55.830 --> 00:14:00.260\nAnd if I wanna reorder, so sometimes I'm\nasked to place things alphabetically,\n\n229\n00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.320\nyou can do so within the reorder.\n\n230\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.070\nAnd then you can move it up and down.\n\n231\n00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:07.659\nAnd then you just select the check box and\n\n232\n00:14:07.659 --> 00:14:10.510\nthen this will automatically\nsort things alphabetically.\n\n233\n00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.350\nYou can also at this point,\nthe second place, to change to default.\n\n234\n00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:19.534\nSo I'm gonna save this here.\n\n235\n00:14:19.534 --> 00:14:22.070\nAnd so this is your holding tank for\n\n236\n00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:27.870\nmaking changes to the individual\nfield itself if it's a pick list.\n\n237\n00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.254\nIf there are, let's go back.\n\n238\n00:14:33.643 --> 00:14:35.684\nI'm gonna go back into lead fields here.\n\n239\n00:14:35.684 --> 00:14:38.349\nAnd I'll always have\nthis sectioned opened up,\n\n240\n00:14:38.349 --> 00:14:40.949\ntake you back to the home\npage of the lead field.\n\n241\n00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:44.369\nNow we can see those\nare standard fields but\n\n242\n00:14:44.369 --> 00:14:48.368\nthe place to create\nthe custom fields lives here.\n\n243\n00:14:48.368 --> 00:14:52.739\nAnd this is also the holding place\nto do map of the lead field so\n\n244\n00:14:52.739 --> 00:14:54.984\nthese are custom fields here.\n\n245\n00:14:54.984 --> 00:14:59.840\nIt's gonna ask me at the point of\nconversion when I'm creating an account\n\n246\n00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.480\nin contact, for primary,\nwhere should this map to?\n\n247\n00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.220\nSo this is gonna show you\nthe API name of the fields.\n\n248\n00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:10.780\nYou know right here, that this is\nthe account, and this is the opportunity.\n\n249\n00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:15.400\nSo at conversion,\nwhere should current generators map to?\n\n250\n00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.110\nI can see here it's\nopportunity current generators.\n\n251\n00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.340\nBut as you're building out your fields for\n\n252\n00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:25.630\na lead that you want to transfer over\nto either an opportunity or account,\n\n253\n00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.678\nyou wanna make sure that you\ncreate it in both places.\n\n254\n00:15:27.678 --> 00:15:33.420\nAnd then at this place here is\nwhere you do those mappings so\n\n255\n00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.860\nyou can associate it once you convert.\n\n256\n00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:39.970\nSo that covers everything\nas far as conversion goes.\n\n257\n00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:44.030\nThe next important piece as far as\nleads go are lead assignment rules.\n\n258\n00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.979\nSo let's go over here.\n\n259\n00:15:51.517 --> 00:15:56.295\nNow you can have lead assignment\nroles identified to the user.\n\n260\n00:15:56.295 --> 00:16:00.801\nYou can have it set to a queue, you can\nhave them sit in a holding tank where the,\n\n261\n00:16:00.801 --> 00:16:02.662\nif you go into the queue itself.\n\n262\n00:16:02.662 --> 00:16:05.301\nLet's go into Standard.\n\n263\n00:16:05.301 --> 00:16:10.170\nSo this is a pre-built one that I\ncreated of a lead assignment role\n\n264\n00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:12.385\nthat will assign the leads and\n\n265\n00:16:12.385 --> 00:16:18.800\nyou can see the order here based off if\nthe country's US, assign it to myself.\n\n266\n00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.530\nIf the country is not equal to the US,\nin my example, I'm the only user,\n\n267\n00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:23.463\nassign it to myself.\n\n268\n00:16:23.463 --> 00:16:25.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But you get the picture there.\n\n269\n00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.570\nSo you can create many assignment roles.\n\n270\n00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:33.038\nAnd you can assign it to\nchoose a group of users.\n\n271\n00:16:33.038 --> 00:16:37.245\nSo especially if you're working with\na site or company, it's e-commerce and\n\n272\n00:16:37.245 --> 00:16:39.145\nyou're generating a lot of leads.\n\n273\n00:16:39.145 --> 00:16:44.180\nAnd you need to queue them into place and\nyou want to create that queue first.\n\n274\n00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.970\nAnd the only way for them to pull, for\n\n275\n00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:51.550\neveryone to kind of pull from this\nlist is to accept the leads itself.\n\n276\n00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:57.360\nSo as I go into queues, if I had one\nbuilt out, you'll see the lead queue.\n\n277\n00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.140\nAnd you have the object of showing\nwhich object am I talking about?\n\n278\n00:17:02.256 --> 00:17:07.494\nSo lead, let's say Leads US,\nand it's gonna type in the API\n\n279\n00:17:07.494 --> 00:17:12.438\nname as I hit Tab and\nthen you can send an email to members.\n\n280\n00:17:12.438 --> 00:17:16.328\nAnd then this is gonna be for\nthe selected object\n\n281\n00:17:16.328 --> 00:17:21.296\nhere Who sits in this queue?\n\n282\n00:17:21.296 --> 00:17:22.680\nIs it per user?\n\n283\n00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.290\nIs it per group profile?\n\n284\n00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.510\nSo you have the groups and roles.\n\n285\n00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:32.240\nBut we're just gonna do myself.\n\n286\n00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.590\nAnd then once you have that saved,\nI am a part of this queue.\n\n287\n00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:39.380\nI can go to this queue and I can see\neverything that sits under this queue.\n\n288\n00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.480\nSo you can kind of see how everything\npieces and rolls up together.\n\n289\n00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:47.020\nAnd then everyone who has access to see\nthat queue, they can go in there and\n\n290\n00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.620\nstart pulling out leads and records.\n\n291\n00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.166\nAnd then they become\nthe owner of that record.\n\n292\n00:17:56.183 --> 00:18:02.788\nSo that covers for lead queue and then let\nme go back into the lead object itself.\n\n293\n00:18:06.666 --> 00:18:09.789\nAnd go into the Web-to-Lead.\n\n294\n00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:14.402\nSo, you can have this built out and\nit's easy to create\n\n295\n00:18:14.402 --> 00:18:20.280\na Web-to-Lead that you place\nthe code within your website.\n\n296\n00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.560\nAnd all of those leads will\ngenerate into Salesforce.\n\n297\n00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.880\nSo if I go over into\ncreate Web-to-lead form,\n\n298\n00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.590\nit's gonna pull from\nthe fields that I give it.\n\n299\n00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:33.359\nReal simple, it takes two minutes,\ncustom fields will show here.\n\n300\n00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.781\nAnd so I just pull [INAUDIBLE] and\nadd them into selected fields,\n\n301\n00:18:38.781 --> 00:18:40.437\ngive me the return URL.\n\n302\n00:18:40.437 --> 00:18:45.696\nAnd then with that, once I hit Generate,\nit will create the code for you and you\n\n303\n00:18:45.696 --> 00:18:51.050\ncan save it in notepad and then hand off\nto your website developer who will then.\n\n304\n00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.340\nOnce that's pushed in, that will all\npush all the leads into Salesforce.\n\n305\n00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.750\nAnd then Salesforce will\nrecognize that leads and\n\n306\n00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:01.452\nsee, does it need to placed in a queue,\nwhere should it go next?\n\n307\n00:19:01.452 --> 00:19:08.020\nAnd one more thing though that I do\nwant to cover is the homepage of a lead.\n\n308\n00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:12.090\nSo, I am in the homepage here,\nwe've gone through what you can see,\n\n309\n00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:16.390\nbut what other things can you do\nwith leads that are important?\n\n310\n00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:20.910\nYou can import your leads at this point,\nmass delete leads, but\n\n311\n00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:24.050\nyou can also transfer leads and\nas a whole.\n\n312\n00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.640\nSo if I go into Mass Transfer Leads,\n\n313\n00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:31.530\nyou can transfer from this\nuser to another user.\n\n314\n00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:36.110\nAnd that's important if someone's leaving\nor you need a mass move data over.\n\n315\n00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:38.200\nEspecially if your leads\nare in a holding tank.\n\n316\n00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.480\nAnd if you've purchased a list\nyou can have, anywhere from\n\n317\n00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:46.250\nthousands of leads sitting and you can't\nlose things individually one by one.\n\n318\n00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.410\nSo this is used often,\nthe Mass Transfer Leads and\n\n319\n00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:53.960\nalso Mass Emailing Leads\nto adding them to campaign.\n\n320\n00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.980\nSo you're still with lead,\nyou're still qualifying them.\n\n321\n00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.667\nSo maybe there's a material\nthat you want to send now and\n\n322\n00:19:59.667 --> 00:20:03.350\nin some of our later episode,\nwe're gonna go through campaigns.\n\n323\n00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:07.700\nBut this is how lead and campaigns and\neverything ties together.\n\n324\n00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.850\nSo if we had an existing campaign,\nyou can search for the campaign name and\n\n325\n00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:18.160\nit'll give you a list and there are no\ncurrently active campaigns right now.\n\n326\n00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.700\nBut you would be able to search it and\nthen add them,\n\n327\n00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.920\nselect a member status and\ntrack in future.\n\n328\n00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.330\nThe ROA that's connected\nfrom this entire process,\n\n329\n00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:33.470\nfrom the lead all the way to\nthe conversion to an actual customer.\n\n330\n00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.940\nSo it's good to keep track\nof this information early on\n\n331\n00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:41.110\nas you're sending out and creating and\nadding them to campaigns.\n\n332\n00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.505\n&gt;&gt; Now is there any limitation\nas far as that Web-to-Lead-\n\n333\n00:20:45.505 --> 00:20:46.170\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n334\n00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.900\n&gt;&gt; Number of leads we can\nstart getting through that?\n\n335\n00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.660\n&gt;&gt; No, that's a great question.\n\n336\n00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.720\nCuz if you go into and\nsomething that I'll do for\n\n337\n00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.970\nmost of my objects is I go into Leads.\n\n338\n00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:01.826\nAnd you can see your\nlimitations too with the lead.\n\n339\n00:21:01.826 --> 00:21:03.209\nLet's see here.\n\n340\n00:21:05.624 --> 00:21:09.060\nLead limits,\nexactly what I was looking for.\n\n341\n00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:15.070\nAnd this will tell you and this is per\nlicense, so some may have more options.\n\n342\n00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:18.724\nFor more usage available and\nsome things can be purchased as add-ons.\n\n343\n00:21:18.724 --> 00:21:21.592\nBut this will show you your place,\nlet me zoom in for\n\n344\n00:21:21.592 --> 00:21:24.080\neveryone to see what your limitations are.\n\n345\n00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:28.040\nSo I used five custom fields,\nI can create 500.\n\n346\n00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:32.923\nAny workflows attached or\nvalidation rules attached to this\n\n347\n00:21:32.923 --> 00:21:36.860\nobject might limit with\nthis license is 500.\n\n348\n00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.150\nSo this gives you a good idea.\n\n349\n00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:44.113\nBut you can generate all the fields\nto answer your question for\n\n350\n00:21:44.113 --> 00:21:47.748\nthe Web-to-Lead in one code is generated.\n\n351\n00:21:47.748 --> 00:21:48.711\nNo limit [LAUGH].\n\n352\n00:21:48.711 --> 00:21:49.652\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n353\n00:21:49.652 --> 00:21:50.774\nAll right, Felicia,\n\n354\n00:21:50.774 --> 00:21:54.692\nagain another great look there at the way\nwe do lead management in Salesforce.\n\n355\n00:21:54.692 --> 00:21:57.360\nLots of the tools there to\n\n356\n00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.220\nlet you manage those leads throughout\ntheir lifetime as we contact them.\n\n357\n00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.880\nAs we start to convert them into\nopportunities, so we thank you for that.\n\n358\n00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.320\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n359\n00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.280\nSigning of for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n360\n00:22:10.280 -->

differences\nbetween them is this Felicia Duarte.\n\n10\n00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.820\nWelcome back Felicia.\n\n11\n00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.120\n&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone so\n\n12\n00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.520\nthis episode accounts for\n9% of the questions on the exam.\n\n13\n00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.840\nSo, this covers everything in Sales Cloud,\naccounts context,\n\n14\n00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.390\nwe'll also break up this episode and\ndiscuss opportunities.\n\n15\n00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.930\nSo, I'm gonna start\nwith what's an account?\n\n16\n00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.620\nWhat considered an account?\n\n17\n00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.420\nWhat is a homepage look like?\n\n18\n00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.550\nWhat's difference between the contact,\ncontact homepages with some\n\n19\n00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.820\nof the functionality there, and\nthen how do you relate the two.\n\n20\n00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.100\nAnd what can you do with the two, what\ncan you do as far as sharing access to\n\n21\n00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.790\ndifferent roles within the accounts\nwhether some of the standard field.\n\n22\n00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.460\nAnd these are some of the questions\nyou're gonna see on the exam.\n\n23\n00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.320\nSo, let's start with the accounts.\n\n24\n00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.870\nSo what is an account?\n\n25\n00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.800\nOff an account and Sales Force\nto be considered an individual,\n\n26\n00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.175\nit can be considered a household and it\ncan be, it's mostly known as the company\n\n27\n00:01:23.175 --> 00:01:27.160\nitself foremost business on this cases and\nthen the contact.\n\n28\n00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.970\nWhere's the contact?\n\n29\n00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.630\nContacts, can be the people within\nthe company in that example.\n\n30\n00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.760\nFor a household, it can be everyone\nthat sits within the household.\n\n31\n00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.140\nIt can be the mother, father, children.\n\n32\n00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.040\nEspecially in financial accounts,\nthat's how we see it used often.\n\n33\n00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.060\nAnd then for\nthose who are individuals, and\n\n34\n00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.990\nyou really don't want any orphan contacts,\nbut when you're looking to report, or\n\n35\n00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.290\nreport on information separate\nfrom the account then the contact.\n\n36\n00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.290\nSometimes you have the individual\nmyself being an example living both in\n\n37\n00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.380\nthe account and contact.\n\n38\n00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.330\nSo those are three examples of used cases\nthat we set up often in Sales force and\n\n39\n00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.580\nthat you may as a system admin.\n\n40\n00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.390\nSo.\n\n41\n00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.590\n&gt;&gt; Do contacts ever exist\nwithout accounts or\n\n42\n00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.170\nthere's always gonna be an account\nassociated with the contacts?\n\n43\n00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.918\n&gt;&gt; There's always gonna be an account\nassociated with the contact.\n\n44\n00:02:14.918 --> 00:02:18.260\nThat's a great question because we'll go\nover through some of the required fields,\n\n45\n00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.800\nthat you will see for\nthe account and for the contact.\n\n46\n00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.690\nAnd these you should know,\nespecially when you're doing data imports\n\n47\n00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.920\nin order to make them successful,\nin order to save a record,\n\n48\n00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.380\nand then these are some questions\nthat are asked on the exam itself.\n\n49\n00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.239\nSo I'm gonna jump into my page here,\nand we're gonna go over to the accounts\n\n50\n00:02:44.058 --> 00:02:45.606\nAnd now another thing too,\n\n51\n00:02:45.606 --> 00:02:49.580\nwhat are some different types\nof accounts that you can see.\n\n52\n00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.130\nIn our earlier episodes\nwe discussed prospects.\n\n53\n00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.820\nSo, accounts certainly can be prospects.\n\n54\n00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.020\nIt's not just accounts, current customers\nof yours, only current customers of yours.\n\n55\n00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.380\nThey're definitely segmented\ninto different ways.\n\n56\n00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.180\nSo this can be same holding ground, for\n\n57\n00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.050\nthe information that you\nstore on competitors.\n\n58\n00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.640\nThis can also be the holding tank\nthat used our information for\n\n59\n00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.880\nthose who are warmer leads.\n\n60\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.930\nAnd you determine being the system admin,\n\n61\n00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.740\nhow personalized do you make this for\nyou org.\n\n62\n00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.150\nSo, I'm gonna stay here\nright here on the home page.\n\n63\n00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.820\nRight now what you have access to do, same\nwith any home page across on the tab right\n\n64\n00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.100\nhere, they're all gonna\nlook somewhat similar.\n\n65\n00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.060\nBut at the very bottom some have\na little bit more customization and\n\n66\n00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.040\nchanges that you can do\non the home page itself.\n\n67\n00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.750\nSo, you have the list views and then you\nhave the same views that you see on most\n\n68\n00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.240\nother objects, recently created,\nmodified, and viewed.\n\n69\n00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.460\nNow, scrolling down bottom more,\n\n70\n00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.690\nthere's three different ways\nto create your accounts.\n\n71\n00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.330\nYou can create it through a data import,\nyou can create it by\n\n72\n00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.410\nhitting the new button, but you can also\ncreate it by doing a Quick Create here.\n\n73\n00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.440\nSo you can see, if you're just generating,\ncreating accounts and\n\n74\n00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.990\nyou're on the go,\nthis is your Quick Create.\n\n75\n00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.010\nWe also have it at the very top,\ncreate new here, but\n\n76\n00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.510\nthis is just a faster way if you're on\nyour home page and you have access.\n\n77\n00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.880\nTo enter information at\nthis point right here.\n\n78\n00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.760\nAnd all you really need is\nthe company name, the account name,\n\n79\n00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.630\nthe household name.\n\n80\n00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.590\nAnd I'll use those words interchangeably.\n\n81\n00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.540\nSo for account two I've set up\na lot org's where we rename it,\n\n82\n00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.480\nwe can rename leads, accounts,\ncontacts, and opportunities.\n\n83\n00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.250\nAnd I wanna quickly show\nyou where to do that.\n\n84\n00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.730\nBecause it is often used.\n\n85\n00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.710\nA nomenclature can change from\nbusiness to business, and\n\n86\n00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.788\nall you select is rename or search.\n\n87\n00:04:45.788 --> 00:04:48.440\nSo I'm gonna search rename,\n\n88\n00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.490\nwhere I'm just gonna enter the first few\nletters and it's gonna take me here.\n\n89\n00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.040\nAnd these are all your standard objects\nin Sales force that can be changed.\n\n90\n00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.590\nSo you have the singular and\npro versions that can change,\n\n91\n00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.334\nand if I were to select Edit.\n\n92\n00:05:04.668 --> 00:05:07.550\nMost often if I'm not\nchanging the name and\n\n93\n00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.435\nthis is the way it would appear at\nthe very top, I'm often asked to change\n\n94\n00:05:12.435 --> 00:05:17.115\none of the fields on the accounts\nwhich is the billing address.\n\n95\n00:05:17.115 --> 00:05:19.265\nSometimes or shipping address.\n\n96\n00:05:19.265 --> 00:05:23.335\nSometimes I'm asked to change from\nbilling to company address or so,\n\n97\n00:05:23.335 --> 00:05:25.667\nI'm just gonna show you what\nthat would look like, and\n\n98\n00:05:25.667 --> 00:05:31.610\nwe're gonna change this field\nhere to company address.\n\n99\n00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.350\nSo, remember you're gonna go to rename,\n\n100\n00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.680\nand you're gonna go into the object that\nyou would like to change, and you're gonna\n\n101\n00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.070\ncome into the section here and simply just\nchange the field or change the object.\n\n102\n00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.990\nIf you're only looking\nto change the object,\n\n103\n00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.460\nif I were to change it from\naccounts to financial accounts.\n\n104\n00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.370\nIt would take in all these\nfields at that point and\n\n105\n00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.110\nchange everything that had the word\naccounts into the new word.\n\n106\n00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.490\nSo you don't have to go in field\nby field to make those changes.\n\n107\n00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.570\nIt'd be a pretty tedious task to do,\n[LAUGH] because there are a lot of fields.\n\n108\n00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.710\nSo but right now, I'm just looking\nto change one field at a time.\n\n109\n00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.040\nSo I skip to that first step, and\n\n110\n00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.180\nI'm showing you at the very bottom,\nthere's nothing else I wanna change.\n\n111\n00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.092\nI wanna change that one field and\nI'm gonna hit Save.\n\n112\n00:06:15.092 --> 00:06:18.360\nSo now we're gonna navigate\nback to the account.\n\n113\n00:06:21.288 --> 00:06:25.251\nAnd as we were initially doing,\nwe're gonna go into the record itself.\n\n114\n00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:32.470\nSo, this affects board-wide, so\nanything that had the address name,\n\n115\n00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.010\nor I'm sorry, that just said address,\nwill now say company address.\n\n116\n00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.580\nOriginally, it said billing address.\n\n117\n00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.236\nSo, that's just showing you how to\nchange the name of some of the standard.\n\n118\n00:06:42.236 --> 00:06:44.080\nFields in Sales force.\n\n119\n00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.240\nThis is an example of an accounts record.\n\n120\n00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.641\nSo you have what's account detail,\n\n121\n00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:54.470\nsome standard Sales force fields\nnon of these has been customized.\n\n122\n00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.580\nAddress information usually\nsits in its own section.\n\n123\n00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.870\nSame with details.\n\n124\n00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.080\nAnd then additional information\nkinda just your holding section for\n\n125\n00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.930\na bunch of other fields\nyou could potentially use.\n\n126\n00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.170\nAnd as always you, every record in sales.\n\n127\n00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.921\nFirst we'll have a created by, and a last\nmodified by and that can be changed.\n\n128\n00:07:11.921 --> 00:07:16.807\nThis is where accountability purposes,\nso let's go ahead and\n\n129\n00:07:16.807 --> 00:07:20.630\ngo into my favorite use\nin navigating here.\n\n130\n00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:25.460\nYou field, and it's gonna take\nme to the object in the set up.\n\n131\n00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.710\nSo, if I need to make any changes\nto any of the standard fields,\n\n132\n00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.760\nyou can do so here.\n\n133\n00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.440\nThis is just to show you some of the\naccount floats that you have access to.\n\n134\n00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.840\nI will say looking at this field here,\nyou have facts.\n\n135\n00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.878\nNow, it's a little dated, some companies\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n136\n00:07:44.878 --> 00:07:46.291\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH], don't use or\n\n137\n00:07:46.291 --> 00:07:50.218\ncollect that information anymore,\nwhat if we navigate and\n\n138\n00:07:50.218 --> 00:07:54.927\nthis is something you may come across for\nsome point I'm sure you have or\n\n139\n00:07:54.927 --> 00:07:59.558\nthe field is existent here, you see\nit exists but your system admin and\n\n140\n00:07:59.558 --> 00:08:04.815\nyou may go into the page layout itself and\nit's on the way out please still don't\n\n141\n00:08:04.815 --> 00:08:09.919\nsee the field This is just an example of\nan account field that is often living,\n\n142\n00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:13.970\nbut not searchable by anyone,\nincluding the system admin.\n\n143\n00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.860\nSo I just navigate to field accessibility.\n\n144\n00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.730\nAnd I'm gonna go into the object,\nright now we're discussing accounts.\n\n145\n00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:29.014\nAnd I'm gonna search by the field,\nAnd this\n\n146\n00:08:29.014 --> 00:08:34.387\nis a way of checking your work anytime\nyou're creating a new field and facts.\n\n147\n00:08:39.312 --> 00:08:43.840\nAnd so in this developer account, it must\nbe editable, so it's gonna be viewable.\n\n148\n00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.725\nBut most often I come across\nwhere that field is hidden.\n\n149\n00:08:46.725 --> 00:08:48.675\nAnd it's sometimes frustrating,\ncuz you see the field and\n\n150\n00:08:48.675 --> 00:08:51.420\nyou don't know where it's at and that's\nprobably the last place you think of to.\n\n151\n00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.860\nSo just remember,\nthere's a place that's field accessible.\n\n152\n00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:59.713\nWhere you can come in and\ncheck what the permission to see is.\n\n153\n00:08:59.713 --> 00:09:05.727\nSo you have the option of it being edible,\nvisible, read-only and if its hidden.\n\n154\n00:09:05.727 --> 00:09:11.410\nIt will say hidden, if it's unchecked as\nvisible, it will say hidden in that list.\n\n155\n00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.230\nSo that's your way of checking\nas you're creating fields\n\n156\n00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.460\nwhere they exist to make those changes and\nmake them visible.\n\n157\n00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.820\nAnd if it was not listed\n\n158\n00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:25.290\nin that account field section where\nwe were at, it does not exist.\n\n159\n00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.170\nSo maybe you created it elsewhere,\nbut this is your holding tank for\n\n160\n00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:30.660\naccount fields here.\n\n161\n00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.680\nWe've discovered in a previous episode\nhow to make changes to picklist values,\n\n162\n00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.480\njust like you do in leads.\n\n163\n00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.840\nSo the same way affects any other objects.\n\n164\n00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.900\nSo accounting contacts,\nI won't cover that.\n\n165\n00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.160\nThese fields, same area you'll\nsee across all the objects,\n\n166\n00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.720\nas far as where the customs fields sit and\nwhere the standard fields sit.\n\n167\n00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.425\nSo let's just go through back into\nthe account, and take a look at,\n\n168\n00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:56.329\nas you're creating a new one,\nwhat are some of those required fields?\n\n169\n00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:07.902\nAnd so I'm gonna use,\nCloud Creations as my example,\n\n170\n00:10:07.902 --> 00:10:10.789\nand if there was a parent account.\n\n171\n00:10:10.789 --> 00:10:15.218\nSo maybe we work for ABC company and\nthere's ABC West, North, East,\n\n172\n00:10:15.218 --> 00:10:17.633\nyou want ABC to be your headquarters.\n\n173\n00:10:17.633 --> 00:10:20.119\nAnd you want to be able\nto see that hierarchy.\n\n174\n00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:24.620\nSo I'm gonna create, first I would\nneed to create my parent account.\n\n175\n00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.320\nSo let's call this Cloud Creations HQ.\n\n176\n00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.310\nAnd I'm gonna create my parent account\nfirst, because this is a look up field.\n\n177\n00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:37.580\nEnter any data I have here, at this point,\nto use, initially save the record.\n\n178\n00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.840\nI don't have to enter anything else,\nI don't need the billing information.\n\n179\n00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.773\nI don't need anything\nbesides the company name.\n\n180\n00:10:44.773 --> 00:10:50.790\nSo, I'm gonna select Save, and\nnow you see everything else is blank.\n\n181\n00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.412\nI have no data, but\nnow I'm gonna create a new, and\n\n182\n00:10:54.412 --> 00:10:59.228\nI'm going to use this,\nCreate New quick access toolbar over here.\n\n183\n00:10:59.228 --> 00:11:01.269\nAnd I'm gonna create Cloud Creations.\n\n184\n00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:10.969\nAnd I wanna create this hierarchy\nrelationship between the parent and\n\n185\n00:11:10.969 --> 00:11:12.100\nchild records.\n\n186\n00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.230\nSo it's a simple look up field, and\n\n187\n00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:17.750\nI can see these are some of my\nrecently viewed accounts here.\n\n188\n00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:23.730\nI can also search,\nif it didn't populate, and do a Cloud.\n\n189\n00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:29.790\nAnd this is our wild asterisk, so\nwe can search across every record.\n\n190\n00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:34.910\nUsing what you have displayed here, and\nyou can also change the way of what\n\n191\n00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.860\ncolumns populate at this\npoint here within your setup.\n\n192\n00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.230\nBut, right now, this is the one we're\nlooking for, Cloud Creations HQ.\n\n193\n00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:46.655\nMaybe I have more details about\nthis one which I can enter.\n\n194\n00:11:46.655 --> 00:11:49.549\nBut, right now,\nwe're just gonna keep it pretty simple and\n\n195\n00:11:49.549 --> 00:11:51.840\nwe're just gonna show\nthe relationship here.\n\n196\n00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.590\nSo I have Cloud Creation South,\n\n197\n00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:59.350\nI want to see the hierarchy between this\nparent account, parent and child record.\n\n198\n00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:04.060\nI simply click View Hierarchy, and,\nif I had more accounts associated,\n\n199\n00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.460\nyou can see the relationship here.\n\n200\n00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:11.141\nSo this is how you create that\nparent child account relationship.\n\n201\n00:12:12.957 --> 00:12:16.748\nSo I'm going to navigate,\nand more clicks than needed.\n\n202\n00:12:16.748 --> 00:12:18.102\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n203\n00:12:18.102 --> 00:12:20.603\n&gt;&gt; And I wanna navigate back here and\n\n204\n00:12:20.603 --> 00:12:23.690\nshow you now how to create a contact.\n\n205\n00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:28.630\nThen let's create those together, so\nmerge those relationships together.\n\n206\n00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.585\nYou can create and\n\n207\n00:12:29.585 --> 00:12:34.246\nI'm gonna go into the contact\nhomepage first and do it from here.\n\n208\n00:12:34.246 --> 00:12:38.150\nJust to show that you don't really\nwant any orphaned contacts or\n\n209\n00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.144\ncontacts without accounts,\nbecause they can easily be missed.\n\n210\n00:12:42.144 --> 00:12:48.190\nSo for a contact,\nthe required fields is just Last Name.\n\n211\n00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:52.670\nYou can, if needed to, you can have\ncontacts that sit without accounts, but\n\n212\n00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:56.760\nthose are easily lost and\nthere's no relationship.\n\n213\n00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.670\nI usually place them in\na bucket of some sort,\n\n214\n00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.350\ncuz there's no place to kind of put them.\n\n215\n00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:05.680\nWith Salesforce,\nyou have person's accounts, and\n\n216\n00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:10.030\nwhat that does is that merges accounts and\ncontacts into one object.\n\n217\n00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:15.910\nAnd once you do that, you cannot disable,\n\n218\n00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.550\nyou can't take it back once\nyou set up person's accounts.\n\n219\n00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:22.277\nAnd it's just,\nthere's a lot of limitations there.\n\n220\n00:13:22.277 --> 00:13:26.323\nBut if you do wanna utilize standard\nSalesforce accounts and contacts,\n\n221\n00:13:26.323 --> 00:13:31.220\njust place them in a bucket if you don't\nhave a company name to hold them under.\n\n222\n00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:37.712\nSo I'm just gonna enter my information,\nAnd really all I need is a last name.\n\n223\n00:13:37.712 --> 00:13:42.168\nI've seen lists before where\nthey don't have the first name.\n\n224\n00:13:42.168 --> 00:13:44.629\nOr, if you're looking at historical data,\n\n225\n00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:48.990\nmaybe the database they were using before\nthose who were entering data in site.\n\n226\n00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.913\nIt was just bad data, and you see first\nand last name in just the first name or\n\n227\n00:13:52.913 --> 00:13:54.483\nrecords without last names.\n\n228\n00:13:54.483 --> 00:13:57.917\nSome tips is we just,\nto push the data in, we'll just put\n\n229\n00:13:57.917 --> 00:14:02.570\nwhatever information we see in the last\nname in order to save the record.\n\n230\n00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:06.870\nSo right here I'm gonna just\nkeep it simple and search for\n\n231\n00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.418\nthe account name to associate it to.\n\n232\n00:14:08.418 --> 00:14:15.694\nSo, Cloud Creations, I belong to\nthe South, and I'm gonna hit Save.\n\n233\n00:14:18.997 --> 00:14:23.743\nSo you can see the hyperlink will take\nme directly into the account record.\n\n234\n00:14:23.743 --> 00:14:25.913\nAnd then you can see the relationships,\nand\n\n235\n00:14:25.913 --> 00:14:29.500\nsee the multiple contacts\nthat you can add from here.\n\n236\n00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.653\nI prefer to go into the record itself and\nadd the contact from this point.\n\n237\n00:14:33.653 --> 00:14:39.658\nSo if I had somebody else I wanted to add,\nI'm gonna add to this one.\n\n238\n00:14:39.658 --> 00:14:46.508\nHe would stay in HQ, but I'm gonna add our\nCEO Justin Davis and I'm gonna hit Save.\n\n239\n00:14:46.508 --> 00:14:50.290\nAnd you can see without having\nthe search for the account itself.\n\n240\n00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:55.773\nI can just Create New from the account\npage in the related list for contacts.\n\n241\n00:14:55.773 --> 00:14:58.520\nSo now we have two contacts here.\n\n242\n00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.540\nIf there were details that were more\nimportant to see at a glance, again,\n\n243\n00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:07.750\nyou go into the page layouts to make\nthose changes on the related list.\n\n244\n00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:11.497\nTo see at a glance what information\nis most important to see.\n\n245\n00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:19.150\nSo that's going to show you how\nto associate accounting contacts.\n\n246\n00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:20.860\nNow lets go back into the homepage,\n\n247\n00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:25.330\nand see what other changes can you\ndo from this option, this page here.\n\n248\n00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.506\nSo aside from pulling reports, you can\ndirectly come into the account page and\n\n249\n00:15:30.506 --> 00:15:32.030\ngenerate activity reports.\n\n250\n00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:36.040\nYou can generate which ones are active,\nwhich ones are not active.\n\n251\n00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:39.690\nContact roles,\nwhich I'll touch base on, but\n\n252\n00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:43.490\nyou can also use this as a place to\nimport accounts and contacts here.\n\n253\n00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.530\nAnd so this will walk you\nthrough the import process,\n\n254\n00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.040\nwhich we'll cover in\none of our later demos.\n\n255\n00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.784\nYou can also,\nthis is used to merge accounts.\n\n256\n00:15:54.784 --> 00:15:57.843\nSo if you're working with\nan account that has trouble,\n\n257\n00:15:57.843 --> 00:16:02.019\nthat they have a lot of duplicated data\nin here, you can search for the name.\n\n258\n00:16:02.019 --> 00:16:07.494\nSo let's see of we have another\nname account in here with Cloud.\n\n259\n00:16:07.494 --> 00:16:09.999\nAnd it's looking right now at\nthe parent and child record.\n\n260\n00:16:09.999 --> 00:16:12.710\nAnd it's asking do you wanna\nmerge these two accounts?\n\n261\n00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.035\nI'm gonna select Next, I really don't\nwant to, it's a parent and child but\n\n262\n00:16:17.035 --> 00:16:18.275\nI will walk you through this.\n\n263\n00:16:18.275 --> 00:16:20.309\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And\n\n264\n00:16:20.309 --> 00:16:23.307\nif I had details on all these fields here,\n\n265\n00:16:23.307 --> 00:16:28.730\nit will show you from left to right,\nwhich information do you wanna merge.\n\n266\n00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:33.769\nAnd it'll prompt you which one's\ngonna be the one that you wanna keep.\n\n267\n00:16:33.769 --> 00:16:39.280\n[LAUGH] And you can select this one or\nthat one and hit Merge.\n\n268\n00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.120\nAnd I'm gonna hit Cancel so\nI don't merge these two records.\n\n269\n00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.580\nBut before you proceed,\nyou're prompted before doing that.\n\n270\n00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.949\nAnd you can kinda walk through\nall of your accounts here and\n\n271\n00:16:47.949 --> 00:16:51.339\ncontinue this process to kind\nof weed out any duplicates.\n\n272\n00:16:51.339 --> 00:16:53.270\n&gt;&gt; Yes, cuz that's a really great feature.\n\n273\n00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.830\nI love that side by side view.\n\n274\n00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:58.770\nCuz I know when you first get everything\nbrought in, maybe had salespeople\n\n275\n00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:01.818\nkeeping their own records and\nthey had duplicate information.\n\n276\n00:17:01.818 --> 00:17:05.012\nPeople they had talked to but slightly\ndifferent information on address or\n\n277\n00:17:05.012 --> 00:17:05.728\ncontact point.\n\n278\n00:17:05.728 --> 00:17:09.659\nGives you that visible\ncut side by side view.\n\n279\n00:17:09.659 --> 00:17:12.953\nI could say, okay, which ones,\nare these actually the same,\n\n280\n00:17:12.953 --> 00:17:14.840\nwhich information do I wanna keep?\n\n281\n00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.928\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, great point, yup, and then\nanother thing that's a great feature with\n\n282\n00:17:18.928 --> 00:17:20.903\nSalesforce is you have the account team.\n\n283\n00:17:20.903 --> 00:17:24.158\nSo I'm gonna just type in accounts.\n\n284\n00:17:24.158 --> 00:17:27.408\nAnd these are all the options\nthat you have again to set up.\n\n285\n00:17:27.408 --> 00:17:32.502\nBut if we go over here to Account Teams,\nthis is different than the team setting\n\n286\n00:17:32.502 --> 00:17:38.000\nthat you would have for opportunities and\nopportunity teams, team selling.\n\n287\n00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.070\nAccount teams, you can associate\ndifferent account members to\n\n288\n00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:47.660\nyour accounts if you need to enable them\naccess, and you have control of that here.\n\n289\n00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:53.000\nSo, the first part or first step to doing\nthis would be to enable account teams.\n\n290\n00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.110\nSo, by default, it's not enabled.\n\n291\n00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:57.980\nIt's a related list that you would\nhave to pull in your accounts, and\n\n292\n00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.270\nthis is great to kind of associate\neveryone's role within this account.\n\n293\n00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:07.300\nMaybe you need to show access to\ndifferent users within your org just\n\n294\n00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.200\nto specific account,\nto an individual account.\n\n295\n00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.310\nThis is just another way of opening up and\n\n296\n00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:18.040\nsharing access to the information\nrelated for different people to see.\n\n297\n00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:22.920\nAnd I'm gonna enabled it first.\n\n298\n00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:25.130\nAnd I'm gonna select\nan Account Teams Enabled.\n\n299\n00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:31.330\nAnd then at this point,\nyou can select which page layout.\n\n300\n00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:35.950\nAnd you can have different layouts\nto show, who is this applicable to?\n\n301\n00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:40.450\nWho should have access to see and\nadd account teams?\n\n302\n00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:46.324\nAnd the who of this of who has the option\nto share this would be the owner itself or\n\n303\n00:18:46.324 --> 00:18:49.177\nanyone who has access to this record.\n\n304\n00:18:49.177 --> 00:18:52.858\nWhether they have access based\non the role hierarchy itself or\n\n305\n00:18:52.858 --> 00:18:56.610\njust access because they're\nthe owner of the record.\n\n306\n00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.460\nThat will determine who sees this.\n\n307\n00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.810\nSo right now I'm just gonna\nadd it to all the layouts.\n\n308\n00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:08.483\nAnd this will add it to the related list,\nyou can do it at this point here.\n\n309\n00:19:08.483 --> 00:19:10.836\nBut if you didn't,\nyou would have to drag it down.\n\n310\n00:19:10.836 --> 00:19:13.824\nAnd now you have the setup for\naccount teams.\n\n311\n00:19:13.824 --> 00:19:18.218\nSo this will show you the team roles,\nif you wanna replace the existing team\n\n312\n00:19:18.218 --> 00:19:21.864\nroles or disable account teams,\nthis is the place to go here.\n\n313\n00:19:21.864 --> 00:19:27.785\nSo let's go back into our Accounts and\ninto a detail page of a record.\n\n314\n00:19:31.825 --> 00:19:35.075\nAnd now you'll see because I checked\nthat box that there's an option to add\n\n315\n00:19:35.075 --> 00:19:35.856\nan account team.\n\n316\n00:19:35.856 --> 00:19:41.819\nI'm the system admin or I was the owner of\nthe record so now I have access to add.\n\n317\n00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:47.478\nNow, to speed up the process,\nwhat you saw, I'm gonna take a step back,\n\n318\n00:19:47.478 --> 00:19:48.452\nare default teams.\n\n319\n00:19:48.452 --> 00:19:52.988\nSo, you can have default teams already\npreset based off maybe a certain set\n\n320\n00:19:52.988 --> 00:19:56.883\nof criteria that will automatically\nadd the person to the team.\n\n321\n00:19:56.883 --> 00:20:01.060\nWhether it's the owner or however you\nwanna set that criteria, this way,\n\n322\n00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:05.183\nyou're not going in each time into\neach individual record to set this up.\n\n323\n00:20:05.183 --> 00:20:07.265\nSo right now, we're gonna hit Add.\n\n324\n00:20:07.265 --> 00:20:11.078\nAnd this will show us, and\nit's a look up to the user.\n\n325\n00:20:11.078 --> 00:20:12.930\nSo right now I'm the only user.\n\n326\n00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:15.400\nBut if I had a list of users,\nI can look up and\n\n327\n00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:20.910\nadd each user and for each user,\nI can determine what type of access.\n\n328\n00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:25.350\nNow, there's a slight difference between\nthe account teams and opportunity teams.\n\n329\n00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:29.320\nThe account team,\nyou have access to open up and\n\n330\n00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:33.630\ngrant access to accounts,\nopportunities and cases.\n\n331\n00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:37.010\nAnd then the opportunity which\nwe'll cover in another episode,\n\n332\n00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.540\nyou're only talking\nstrictly opportunities.\n\n333\n00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:44.721\nSo, if I were to select another user,\ndo I wanna give him read/write access,\n\n334\n00:20:44.721 --> 00:20:47.490\nat this point, it's just read/write.\n\n335\n00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.410\nAnd then what's the role here?\n\n336\n00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:52.650\nAnd you can change the name of\nthe rules that they have or\n\n337\n00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:54.562\nthat work within the business.\n\n338\n00:20:54.562 --> 00:20:57.909\nSo this will show,\nlet's see account manager.\n\n339\n00:20:57.909 --> 00:21:01.238\nNow I'm gonna check to\nsee if I can do myself.\n\n340\n00:21:01.238 --> 00:21:06.470\nI want read/write access to\nany accounts opportunities or\n\n341\n00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:11.360\ncases related to this account that we're\nin, right now for Cloud Creations South.\n\n342\n00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.480\nMy role in this is I'm an account manager.\n\n343\n00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.960\nAnd I can add more if I need to add more.\n\n344\n00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:21.270\nAnd, so, as we scroll to the bottom,\nwe can see and have different team members\n\n345\n00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:27.230\nand see everyone's access and\nrole within this account.\n\n346\n00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:33.040\n&gt;&gt; All right, Felicia, again a great look\nthere at how we can deal with accounts and\n\n347\n00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.300\ncontacts within Salesforce working with\nthe different properties available.\n\n348\n00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:41.175\nAnd how we can start using account teams\nto make sharing of that information\n\n349\n00:21:41.175 --> 00:21:43.260\namongst our team members\na little bit easier.\n\n350\n00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.050\nSo we thank you for that Felicia.\n\n351\n00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.210\nI hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n352\n00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:50.280\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n353\n00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.100\n&gt;&gt; I'm Felicia Duarte.\n\n354\n00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:51.666\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n355\n00:21:51.666 -->

00:00:12.304\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.304 --> 00:00:15.701\n&gt;&gt; Hello welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.701 --> 00:00:17.222\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\n\n6\n00:00:17.222 --> 00:00:20.820\ntoday we're doing our Salesforce\ncertified administrator.\n\n7\n00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.984\nIn this episode we're gonna continue\ntaking a look at standard objects\n\n8\n00:00:23.984 --> 00:00:24.941\nwithin Salesforce.\n\n9\n00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:27.360\nWe're gonna be taking\na look at opportunities.\n\n10\n00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.860\nWhat they are, how we can work with them,\nwhat we can do with them.\n\n11\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.900\nAnd here to help us explain all\nof that is Ms. Felicia Duarte.\n\n12\n00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.770\nHello, Felicia.\n\n13\n00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.220\n&gt;&gt; Hello, thanks for having me.\n\n14\n00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.247\nSo, in this episode today,\nI'm going to cover opportunities.\n\n15\n00:00:40.247 --> 00:00:45.130\nOpportunities still holds weight within\nthe sales cloud questions on the exam.\n\n16\n00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.820\nSo this goes in relation to the accountant\ncontacts that we just went over in\n\n17\n00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.040\nthe last episode.\n\n18\n00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.960\nBut opportunities as a whole has its\nown sort of weight in questions that\n\n19\n00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.470\nare most common that you'll\nsee that I'll go over today.\n\n20\n00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.400\nSo I'm gonna start with\nthe opportunity definition.\n\n21\n00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.660\nWhat is considered\nan opportunity in Salesforce?\n\n22\n00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.100\nThis can be seen or\nused or renamed to deals.\n\n23\n00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.490\nSo what is the potential amount that\nyou see an opportunity that someone has\n\n24\n00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.960\nto do business with you.\n\n25\n00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.280\nAnd we'll kind of start there and navigate\ninto Salesforce on the homepage tab here.\n\n26\n00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.430\nSo this contains the info of\nevery deal that you're tracking.\n\n27\n00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.610\nRight here at the homepage,\nI'm just going to start first and\n\n28\n00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.860\ndive right into an existing\nopportunity record.\n\n29\n00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.320\nLet's go into American Banking Corp.\n\n30\n00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.000\nNow, you'll see here already\n\n31\n00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.280\nan existing opportunity is\ngonna be related to an account.\n\n32\n00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.630\nSo I'm gonna scroll to the Detail\npage of my Opportunity and\n\n33\n00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.120\nI can see this is related to this account.\n\n34\n00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.400\nNow, in Opportunity you can have multiple\nopportunities for any given account.\n\n35\n00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.920\nYour stage will show,\nwhere is this Opportunity?\n\n36\n00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.870\nLiving within my sales pipeline.\n\n37\n00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.910\nIn this example this stage\nis still prospecting.\n\n38\n00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.282\nSalesforce out of the box\ngives you a list of stages,\n\n39\n00:02:04.282 --> 00:02:09.127\nbut they can always be personalized and\ncustomized to your sales process.\n\n40\n00:02:09.127 --> 00:02:13.747\nWhat does your pipeline look like, at what\npoint do you wanna be able to tell how\n\n41\n00:02:13.747 --> 00:02:16.897\nlong they've been sitting\nwithin each sales stage?\n\n42\n00:02:16.897 --> 00:02:20.240\nRight now,\nif I double click into my stage.\n\n43\n00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.527\nI can see my stage and probability.\n\n44\n00:02:24.527 --> 00:02:27.640\nYou see the red required\nfield highlighted here.\n\n45\n00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.031\nSo you know that this is\na required field in order to save\n\n46\n00:02:31.031 --> 00:02:33.553\nany opportunity record in sales force.\n\n47\n00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:37.840\nNow, I will say with these values\nhere that Salesforce gives you.\n\n48\n00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.330\nThey give you prospect, qualification,\nanalysis, the proposal.\n\n49\n00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.738\nSome options that are usually used.\n\n50\n00:02:45.738 --> 00:02:48.500\nBut then we also have closed one and\nclosed last.\n\n51\n00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.020\nYou can see it right here by\nleave it sitting in prospecting.\n\n52\n00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.820\nYou have the probability and so the\nprobability in Salesforce is gonna show\n\n53\n00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.540\nyour potential at closing\nthis opportunity to sale.\n\n54\n00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.860\nIf I move it closer to closed one,\nits gonna be a 100%,\n\n55\n00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.900\nI won the sale, I won the deal.\n\n56\n00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.651\nClose loss of course,\nit's gonna move over to zero.\n\n57\n00:03:09.651 --> 00:03:14.858\nAnd you have control into what\npercentages are tied to each stage.\n\n58\n00:03:14.858 --> 00:03:19.670\nSo as you go in and make changes\nto those values for this field.\n\n59\n00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.288\nYou also have the option to\nselecting the probability of it.\n\n60\n00:03:24.288 --> 00:03:26.680\nSo, needs analysis and move to 20.\n\n61\n00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.876\nAnd you can kind of catch how this is\nworking down the line in the stage fields.\n\n62\n00:03:31.876 --> 00:03:36.293\n&gt;&gt; So you're saying that is customizable\nI could change that that analysis stage.\n\n63\n00:03:36.293 --> 00:03:38.930\nIt might be 60% in my book and not 70%.\n\n64\n00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:39.521\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n65\n00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:40.196\nRight.\n\n66\n00:03:40.196 --> 00:03:40.748\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n67\n00:03:40.748 --> 00:03:41.491\n&gt;&gt; I'll show you here.\n\n68\n00:03:41.491 --> 00:03:42.355\nGo to view fields.\n\n69\n00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:44.910\nSo you know where and\nhow to make those changes.\n\n70\n00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.310\nSo every stage has to have\nthat probability tied to it.\n\n71\n00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.740\nSo that's why you'll see both of\nthose fields as required fields.\n\n72\n00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.498\nSo if I dive into stage here.\n\n73\n00:03:55.461 --> 00:03:59.040\nYou can see your options for\nfield dependencies, validation rules.\n\n74\n00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.600\nBut these are my options.\n\n75\n00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.804\nLet's say, hey,\n\n76\n00:04:01.804 --> 00:04:06.412\nI really don't value the proposition\nfirst in my type of organization.\n\n77\n00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:09.100\nSo I'm gonna deactivate this.\n\n78\n00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.110\nMaybe in the future, I might use it.\n\n79\n00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.196\nBut right now, I'm just going to\ndeactivate it instead of deleting it so.\n\n80\n00:04:18.196 --> 00:04:18.770\nYou sure?\n\n81\n00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.960\nAnd while it's loading right here\nyou can also see the options to\n\n82\n00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.280\nsame place to reorder, replace.\n\n83\n00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.060\nThere's printable views so as I'm\nworking sometimes I find this helpful.\n\n84\n00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.570\nSo this looks like it's\ntied to the record I'm,\n\n85\n00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.440\nto one of the existing\nrecords that I'm in.\n\n86\n00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.530\nSo this is a good way to kind of show you.\n\n87\n00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.500\nIf it's tied to something or\n\n88\n00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.440\nbeing modified by another user you\ncan't deactivate it right now.\n\n89\n00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.407\nSo go and make those changes.\n\n90\n00:04:44.407 --> 00:04:46.167\nSo I'm going to take a step back and\n\n91\n00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:49.404\ncontinue what I was going to show\nyou which is a printable view.\n\n92\n00:04:49.404 --> 00:04:55.300\nSo this is often helpful if I'm moving\norgs from one place to another.\n\n93\n00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.151\nOr if I'm looking to kind of collect\nall of these fields and transfer them.\n\n94\n00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:02.726\nI can simply highlight\nit this way when it's,\n\n95\n00:05:02.726 --> 00:05:05.443\nin this place it's just\na little harder to do so.\n\n96\n00:05:05.443 --> 00:05:09.821\nSo that's my little tip there but\nlet's go ahead and\n\n97\n00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:14.895\ncheck to change over the name of,\nlet's just edit this one,\n\n98\n00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:18.030\nclosed one, to kind of show you.\n\n99\n00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.440\nSo this will show you as you're changing\nthe pick list fields, the type that it is,\n\n100\n00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.538\nso the different types you have is a sale\nopen, is a closed one or closed lost.\n\n101\n00:05:26.538 --> 00:05:30.126\nSo maybe you have a different\nnaming convention for closed one or\n\n102\n00:05:30.126 --> 00:05:33.720\nmaybe it's committed and\nthat's your version of a closed one.\n\n103\n00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.280\nSo you can create a new stage and\nname it as a type being as a one sale.\n\n104\n00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.820\nThis way for your forecasting it\ndoesn't fall into the wrong bucket.\n\n105\n00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.385\nAnd then still have it named committed,\nbeing the example.\n\n106\n00:05:46.385 --> 00:05:50.230\nAnd then the probability for\nclosed one would be 100 but\n\n107\n00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.965\nyou can see here, I can name it 99\nif I want, or you have that option.\n\n108\n00:05:54.965 --> 00:05:58.715\nBut that's tied to every\nsingle stage value.\n\n109\n00:05:58.715 --> 00:06:03.211\nAnd in forecast categories, you're\nopportunities tie closely to forecasting.\n\n110\n00:06:03.211 --> 00:06:08.405\nSo this would be marked as closed,\nbecause you no longer need to forecast it.\n\n111\n00:06:08.405 --> 00:06:13.914\nBut some of your other options could be\nadmitted, pipeline, best case, and commit.\n\n112\n00:06:13.914 --> 00:06:17.230\nSo, I'm gonna go back.\n\n113\n00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:22.024\nWe do wanna keep, most organizations do\nkeep closed won and closed lost, but some\n\n114\n00:06:22.024 --> 00:06:27.035\nof these other ones, I'll usually change,\nand you can see some of the details here.\n\n115\n00:06:27.035 --> 00:06:30.470\nBut let's navigate back\ninto our opportunities.\n\n116\n00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.560\nAnd let's go into the most recent record.\n\n117\n00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.190\nAnd as a hit edit,\nyou will see the required feild.\n\n118\n00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.100\nSo you always have to\nhave an Opportunity Name.\n\n119\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.611\nNow, best practice is usually if\nyou're selling a service or a product,\n\n120\n00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:49.242\nit can usually be that service or product.\n\n121\n00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:53.072\nSo Salesforce right here,\nI think, for this Opportunity and\n\n122\n00:06:53.072 --> 00:06:55.300\nwe may not have products tied to it.\n\n123\n00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.651\nFinancial service companies, so\nmaybe there, in that industry,\n\n124\n00:06:59.651 --> 00:07:03.483\ntheir opportunities can be\nthe on boarding of a new client.\n\n125\n00:07:03.483 --> 00:07:07.960\nSo, maybe they name it the accounts name,\nor the client's name, or the type of deal.\n\n126\n00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.016\nI would say be as descriptive as you can,\nor\n\n127\n00:07:10.016 --> 00:07:12.610\nhave your users be as\ndescriptive as you can.\n\n128\n00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:17.150\nSo this way if you have an account\nwith multiple opportunities.\n\n129\n00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.902\nYou are able to distinguish\nfrom each other.\n\n130\n00:07:19.902 --> 00:07:23.310\nYou always have to have a close date.\n\n131\n00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:29.790\nSo again all these are important for when\nyou're importing data and historical data.\n\n132\n00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.131\nIf they don't align or don't match up.\n\n133\n00:07:32.131 --> 00:07:33.270\nYou have to map it somewhere.\n\n134\n00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.295\nYou have to map something to it.\n\n135\n00:07:36.295 --> 00:07:37.320\nSo close date.\n\n136\n00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.483\nWhen do you expect to close the deal?\n\n137\n00:07:38.483 --> 00:07:41.921\nIf it's a historical data,\nif it's a closed one sale and\n\n138\n00:07:41.921 --> 00:07:45.590\nyou're looking to push it in,\nuse that as your closed date.\n\n139\n00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.640\nBut nothing happens if you\ngo past the closed date.\n\n140\n00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.036\nYou can always change the closed date.\n\n141\n00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:54.474\nThis is just kind of your best guess\nat when you expect to close the deal.\n\n142\n00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:58.497\nSo this one,\nwe expect it to close in March of 31st.\n\n143\n00:07:58.497 --> 00:08:02.032\nThis is the calendar,\nwhich you can select.\n\n144\n00:08:02.032 --> 00:08:05.583\nIf I wanna change it to today's date,\nI can select this here.\n\n145\n00:08:05.583 --> 00:08:09.630\nBut you can see, it's pretty easy to\nchange it and make changes to here.\n\n146\n00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.240\nMaybe I'm no longer in\nthe prospecting stage, and\n\n147\n00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.960\nwe're closer to this deal, and\nI am in proposal price quote.\n\n148\n00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.376\nYou can see the probability\nautomatically ties and changes for you.\n\n149\n00:08:19.376 --> 00:08:21.051\nBut you can't leave that blank.\n\n150\n00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:26.348\nAnd maybe I had more information related.\n\n151\n00:08:26.348 --> 00:08:29.828\nIf it was generators, or\nbasic information you can relate,\n\n152\n00:08:29.828 --> 00:08:34.139\nyou can enter that information here,\ncreate custom fields to collect it.\n\n153\n00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:39.941\nBut for more retail-related industries or\nfor those companies that have services.\n\n154\n00:08:39.941 --> 00:08:44.853\nYou're gonna want to list those as\nproducts and I'll show in another episode\n\n155\n00:08:44.853 --> 00:08:48.570\nthe relationships between products and\nopportunities.\n\n156\n00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:52.760\nBut right now we're just strictly talking\nwhat information is gonna be important to\n\n157\n00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.060\nhold at the opportunity level.\n\n158\n00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:59.930\nA question again I've seen on the test,\nwhat are the required fields?\n\n159\n00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:04.110\nClose date, stage, the opportunity name.\n\n160\n00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:09.130\nSo we're gonna hit\nSave To show the changes.\n\n161\n00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.630\nNow best practice,\n\n162\n00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:15.140\nis I like to go, if I'm creating a new\nopportunity, there are two ways to do it.\n\n163\n00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.336\nSo I can go to the Quick Create\nthat we see in the far left, or\n\n164\n00:09:19.336 --> 00:09:23.379\nI can just go into the opportunity\nrecord and click New.\n\n165\n00:09:23.379 --> 00:09:25.961\nYou want to avoid as\nmany clicks as you can.\n\n166\n00:09:25.961 --> 00:09:27.401\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So again,\n\n167\n00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:30.494\nnavigate to the account first,\nif the account exists.\n\n168\n00:09:30.494 --> 00:09:34.883\nBecause if you're doing it backwards, and\nyou're trying to enter an opportunity\n\n169\n00:09:34.883 --> 00:09:37.843\nwhere the account doesn't exist,\nor maybe it exists.\n\n170\n00:09:37.843 --> 00:09:41.406\nYou're just having to double click or\nenter more places, and\n\n171\n00:09:41.406 --> 00:09:43.539\nit's not adoptable to other users.\n\n172\n00:09:43.539 --> 00:09:49.598\nSo, if I wanted to create an account,\nI can select this lookup.\n\n173\n00:09:49.598 --> 00:09:53.438\nAnd if you have this feature enabled,\nwhich, by default it is.\n\n174\n00:09:53.438 --> 00:09:56.664\nMaybe the account doesn't exist and\nI looked in my lookup field and\n\n175\n00:09:56.664 --> 00:09:57.651\nit can't find one.\n\n176\n00:09:57.651 --> 00:10:01.161\nYou can also, and\nit's often missed, select New.\n\n177\n00:10:01.161 --> 00:10:05.763\nAnd this is kinda of your quick create as\nyou're creating the opportunity to also\n\n178\n00:10:05.763 --> 00:10:06.921\ncreate an account.\n\n179\n00:10:09.577 --> 00:10:11.832\n&gt;&gt; Very nice.\nI mean that saves me from having to go,\n\n180\n00:10:11.832 --> 00:10:12.958\nit doesn't exist yet.\n\n181\n00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:15.216\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now I gotta go all the way back out,\n\n182\n00:10:15.216 --> 00:10:16.265\ncreate the account.\n\n183\n00:10:16.265 --> 00:10:18.793\nAnd then do it all over again,\nthat's really nice.\n\n184\n00:10:18.793 --> 00:10:19.866\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, and so\n\n185\n00:10:19.866 --> 00:10:23.810\nlet me go over into some other cool\nfeatures that Opportunities have.\n\n186\n00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:24.880\nSo Opportunity,\n\n187\n00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.300\nit's gonna hold the details of\nwhat you wanna capture in a deal.\n\n188\n00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.500\nDid you send out samples?\n\n189\n00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.010\nHow many samples did you send?\n\n190\n00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.770\nWhat was their feedback?\n\n191\n00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.050\nHave you sent out a quote?\n\n192\n00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.720\nSo those are just most of\nthe custom fields that we set up.\n\n193\n00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.360\nBut from a system admin standpoint,\n\n194\n00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:49.840\nmaybe you're requested to keep track of\nsome of the partners related to this deal.\n\n195\n00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.420\nOr maybe you even wanna keep\ntrack of some of the competitors.\n\n196\n00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.340\nSalesforce, if I were to select New and\n\n197\n00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.940\nyou wanna make changes here, you're\nlooking right here to a list of accounts.\n\n198\n00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.160\nSo, again, they would have to exist first.\n\n199\n00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.557\nIf they don't then you're just\nentering it here with the New button.\n\n200\n00:11:06.557 --> 00:11:11.310\nBut if you want to collect a list of all\nthe partners associated to a specific\n\n201\n00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.295\nopportunity.\n\n202\n00:11:12.295 --> 00:11:18.333\nYou want to drag that list onto\nthe Opportunity object and define a role.\n\n203\n00:11:18.333 --> 00:11:23.256\nThis is sometimes often missed by other\nsystem admins as to where the changes can\n\n204\n00:11:23.256 --> 00:11:24.146\nbe made here.\n\n205\n00:11:24.146 --> 00:11:29.511\nThis partner section lives, and\nthis is the same with competitors.\n\n206\n00:11:29.511 --> 00:11:31.917\nIf we go to Opportunities,\n\n207\n00:11:31.917 --> 00:11:37.469\nit's not the same place that you\nwould find in the field setup.\n\n208\n00:11:37.469 --> 00:11:42.002\nBut you're actually gonna find it\nin its own optimist section here.\n\n209\n00:11:42.002 --> 00:11:43.965\nSo you're gonna click Competitors.\n\n210\n00:11:43.965 --> 00:11:48.222\nAnd this just one place to make those\nchanges to the picklist of values.\n\n211\n00:11:48.222 --> 00:11:51.581\nSame if we go back over here\ninto the opportunity list,\n\n212\n00:11:51.581 --> 00:11:53.290\nwhere would you find that?\n\n213\n00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.778\nSo long list here, we're looking for\n\n214\n00:11:56.778 --> 00:12:01.154\npartners, and Might be missing it here.\n\n215\n00:12:01.154 --> 00:12:02.113\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n216\n00:12:02.113 --> 00:12:02.973\n&gt;&gt; So this is just\n\n217\n00:12:02.973 --> 00:12:06.919\nkind of your holding tank to make\nchanges to some of those values,\n\n218\n00:12:06.919 --> 00:12:09.227\nsome of those picklist values there.\n\n219\n00:12:09.227 --> 00:12:12.183\nSo it's not living just\nin the field list here.\n\n220\n00:12:12.183 --> 00:12:16.733\nBut as I'm here, I wanna show you another\ncool option which is the sales process and\n\n221\n00:12:16.733 --> 00:12:18.225\nthe big deal alerts.\n\n222\n00:12:18.225 --> 00:12:22.730\nSo your sales processes, and\nI'll let that navigate here.\n\n223\n00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.617\nYou may have different aspects or\nsales processes or\n\n224\n00:12:27.617 --> 00:12:31.180\nstages that are different for\neach sales process.\n\n225\n00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.834\nSo maybe for your B2B side of the company,\n\n226\n00:12:33.834 --> 00:12:38.209\nthey have a different sales process\nthan your B2C side of the things.\n\n227\n00:12:38.209 --> 00:12:41.079\nSo you want to create a sales process.\n\n228\n00:12:41.079 --> 00:12:44.393\nAnd you'll have your record\ntypes first created for\n\n229\n00:12:44.393 --> 00:12:48.620\nthe opportunity to kind of associate\nthese different processes.\n\n230\n00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.990\nBecause maybe you don't want\nthem to follow the same or\n\n231\n00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:55.710\ncollect the same data, so\nyou'll want to create this beforehand.\n\n232\n00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.160\nThis way, you can segment\nthe two different processes or\n\n233\n00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.040\nyou can have multiple, so\nyou're not limited in just two.\n\n234\n00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.009\nAnd then another great feature\nwould be the big deal alert, so\n\n235\n00:13:05.009 --> 00:13:07.537\nthis is useful for any sales managers.\n\n236\n00:13:07.537 --> 00:13:10.449\nYou can select and have a different alert.\n\n237\n00:13:10.449 --> 00:13:14.657\nBased off the threshold amount that\nyou define to be notified when\n\n238\n00:13:14.657 --> 00:13:16.778\nan opportunity amount hits.\n\n239\n00:13:16.778 --> 00:13:21.700\nMaybe it's a million dollars, or\nany amount that you defined here.\n\n240\n00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.440\nAnd this will,\nyou have the alert settings,\n\n241\n00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.690\nnotify you via email that, hey,\nkeep an eye on this deal here.\n\n242\n00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:31.700\nThis is a big deal.\n\n243\n00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.300\nYou have the option of notifying\nthe owner of the opportunity.\n\n244\n00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.017\nYou can select the recipients\nthat receive this notification.\n\n245\n00:13:39.017 --> 00:13:43.542\nAnd so this is just to kind of show you\nsome of the automation that you can do for\n\n246\n00:13:43.542 --> 00:13:45.971\nthe opportunity object in Salesforce.\n\n247\n00:13:49.726 --> 00:13:53.597\nSo this is where you enter the threshold,\nthe amount, and\n\n248\n00:13:53.597 --> 00:13:56.051\nthe probability that's tied to it.\n\n249\n00:13:56.051 --> 00:13:58.622\nAnd then whether these\nsettings are active or not.\n\n250\n00:13:58.622 --> 00:14:02.590\nBut you can see here, all of these fields\nhighlighted in red are required fields.\n\n251\n00:14:05.075 --> 00:14:10.707\nIf I take us back to the homepage, another\nfeature that you'll see are the reports.\n\n252\n00:14:10.707 --> 00:14:12.382\nSo you have the options here.\n\n253\n00:14:12.382 --> 00:14:16.585\nSalesforce gives you out the box\na list of standardized reports.\n\n254\n00:14:16.585 --> 00:14:21.145\nBut this is a great way for\nany sales managers to see,\n\n255\n00:14:21.145 --> 00:14:24.160\nwhat are my stock opportunities?\n\n256\n00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.441\nWhat does my pipeline look like?\n\n257\n00:14:26.441 --> 00:14:28.745\nAnd you can customize that even further.\n\n258\n00:14:28.745 --> 00:14:32.815\nBut if you were just to use out\nthe door Salesforce today you\n\n259\n00:14:32.815 --> 00:14:37.410\ncan go straight into these profiles\nthat are pre-built for you.\n\n260\n00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:39.230\nSo you will see, and I'm sorry,\n\n261\n00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:42.419\nreports that this takes me\ninto my opportunity pipeline.\n\n262\n00:14:42.419 --> 00:14:48.755\nAnd it's looking at the sales stages\nthat are already set up by Salesforce.\n\n263\n00:14:48.755 --> 00:14:51.902\nAnd breaking it up by the user and\nthe amounts.\n\n264\n00:14:51.902 --> 00:14:56.713\nSo you have visibility into the pipeline\nstraight from your Opportunities homepage.\n\n265\n00:14:56.713 --> 00:14:59.920\nIf I navigate back the same thing\nif I wanted to go into stock for\n\n266\n00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.720\nopportunities that have closed.\n\n267\n00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.730\nAnd one more kind of tip\nthat I will suggest for\n\n268\n00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.600\nany admins that are importing data.\n\n269\n00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:16.650\nI've seen and set up a lot for\nhistorical retail clients.\n\n270\n00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.427\nIt doesn't make a good fit.\n\n271\n00:15:18.427 --> 00:15:23.707\nOr they don't understand how\nan opportunity can work for past orders.\n\n272\n00:15:23.707 --> 00:15:28.520\nBut you can place them into Salesforce and\ngive them a stage of closed one.\n\n273\n00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:35.755\nFor any historical accounts that have been\ncompleted or fulfilled in Salesforce.\n\n274\n00:15:35.755 --> 00:15:38.118\nAnd then that's your way of segmenting and\n\n275\n00:15:38.118 --> 00:15:41.803\nbeing able to determine all my\nclosed sales or won opportunities.\n\n276\n00:15:41.803 --> 00:15:44.587\nFrom any of the new ones that\nwe're trying to keep track of.\n\n277\n00:15:44.587 --> 00:15:47.200\nOr include into our pipeline.\n\n278\n00:15:49.696 --> 00:15:51.959\nAnd then lastly we have\nthe quarterly summary here.\n\n279\n00:15:51.959 --> 00:15:55.739\nSo you have more control into that\nreport that you're trying to generate.\n\n280\n00:15:55.739 --> 00:15:58.202\nYou can always go to\nthe reports section but\n\n281\n00:15:58.202 --> 00:16:01.425\nAgain we are trying to avoid\nas many clicks as possible.\n\n282\n00:16:01.425 --> 00:16:04.172\nAnd if you can do it\ndirectly from your homepage,\n\n283\n00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:08.193\nwhy not have those custom links\nhere,that you can continue to add to and\n\n284\n00:16:08.193 --> 00:16:12.842\nrun your report from your,the homepage,\nfrom the page you are already going to.\n\n285\n00:16:12.842 --> 00:16:17.010\nSo this was kind of\na neat feature that you.\n\n286\n00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.165\nOutbox.\n\n287\n00:16:18.165 --> 00:16:21.830\n&gt;&gt; Now Felicia is there a way that we can\ntrack contacts that are associated with\n\n288\n00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.610\nthese opportunities?\n\n289\n00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.490\n&gt;&gt; Yes, great question.\n\n290\n00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:27.900\nLet's go over into the opportunity\nrecord again itself,\n\n291\n00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.910\nso I can show you something that I missed.\n\n292\n00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.100\nContact Roles.\n\n293\n00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.620\nSo Contact Roles is\na great place to associate\n\n294\n00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.170\ncontacts that are related to\nthe account to the opportunity.\n\n295\n00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:44.150\nSo, maybe I have multiple contacts that\nare related to this one given opportunity.\n\n296\n00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:48.644\nAnd that's a great way to show, if you\nhave different sales reps working in along\n\n297\n00:16:48.644 --> 00:16:53.006\nthis one large account, let's use Apple\nas an example, and you have multiple\n\n298\n00:16:53.006 --> 00:16:57.238\nopportunities running, there's always\ngonna be somebody different, or\n\n299\n00:16:57.238 --> 00:17:01.098\nteams of people within that account\nassociated to the opportunity.\n\n300\n00:17:01.098 --> 00:17:06.003\nSo all you do is navigate to the specific\nopportunity where these contacts can\n\n301\n00:17:06.003 --> 00:17:08.410\nbe related and select New.\n\n302\n00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:11.412\nAnd so what I was originally\nlooking to show you were,\n\n303\n00:17:11.412 --> 00:17:13.694\ninstead of partners were the contacts.\n\n304\n00:17:13.694 --> 00:17:16.170\nSo we're gonna set Betty as a primary.\n\n305\n00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.360\nBecause she's what we\nstarted this account with.\n\n306\n00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.730\nAnd then we're gonna select.\n\n307\n00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:27.460\nAnd I don't think we have multiple\ncontacts, but let's use Justin.\n\n308\n00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.650\nHe'll maybe be associated somewhere else.\n\n309\n00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.540\nAnd he is the decision maker.\n\n310\n00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:35.890\nSo, I know, maybe as a sales manager,\ngoing into this opportunity.\n\n311\n00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:40.526\nOkay, I wanna talk to decision\nmaker rather than the influencer.\n\n312\n00:17:40.526 --> 00:17:43.298\nAnd you can see here that\nwithin all these rolls,\n\n313\n00:17:43.298 --> 00:17:46.690\nthese can be changed in the same\narea that I showed earlier.\n\n314\n00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.260\nAnd I can add multiple users here,\nI am just gonna add two to show you.\n\n315\n00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:56.210\nAnd now in this opportunity from\nAmerican Bank, I can scroll down and\n\n316\n00:17:56.210 --> 00:18:00.262\nsee okay, there are different contact\nroles related to this opportunity.\n\n317\n00:18:00.262 --> 00:18:03.019\nI wanna contact the decision maker.\n\n318\n00:18:03.019 --> 00:18:04.442\nThis is his contact information, here.\n\n319\n00:18:04.442 --> 00:18:07.890\nand it's just gonna pull in everything\nthat lives within their contact record.\n\n320\n00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.950\nAgain, to show you,\nyou're gonna go to setup.\n\n321\n00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:14.280\nAnd we're gonna go to the opportunity.\n\n322\n00:18:16.779 --> 00:18:18.290\nAnd, as you can see here,\nit's a long list.\n\n323\n00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.000\nSo this is what I was originally\nlooking for is the contact roles and\n\n324\n00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.400\nopportunities here.\n\n325\n00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:28.000\nAnd this is where you deactivate, edit,\ndelete, or even create new values here.\n\n326\n00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:33.260\nOne last thing that I'd like to\npoint out are the opportunity teams.\n\n327\n00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:39.340\nSimilar to the account teams,\nyou can have different users associated to\n\n328\n00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:43.440\nthis one opportunity that you wanna\nallow access to, for this record.\n\n329\n00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.900\nMaybe someone needs to read,\nor see the data.\n\n330\n00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:50.210\nYou wanna go into, wanna enable it.\n\n331\n00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:55.060\nAnd separate from the account teams\nthat we discussed in our last episode.\n\n332\n00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:59.302\nOpportunity teams is only related\nto just the opportunity itself.\n\n333\n00:18:59.302 --> 00:19:04.150\nSo, not the accounts and\nany other contracts related to it.\n\n334\n00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:09.215\nSo, if we search for opportunity.\n\n335\n00:19:09.215 --> 00:19:12.013\nNow we're gonna go to, let's see.\n\n336\n00:19:19.339 --> 00:19:21.270\nRight here, missed it right underneath.\n\n337\n00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.500\nSo, it's not gonna live\nwithin the opportunities.\n\n338\n00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.598\nAnother sub-section of opportunities.\n\n339\n00:19:25.598 --> 00:19:26.291\nThis happens often.\n\n340\n00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:29.054\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz there's a lot to work in within\n\n341\n00:19:29.054 --> 00:19:30.390\nthe Salesforce system.\n\n342\n00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:32.960\nAnd just like the account teams,\nyou need to enable it.\n\n343\n00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.720\nThat's the first step.\n\n344\n00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.940\nSo I'm gonna enable Team Selling,\nis what it's often referred to.\n\n345\n00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.760\nRight now,\nthese are the four page layouts,\n\n346\n00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.380\nwe're still supposed to create C U.\n\n347\n00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:48.054\nDo you only need it for\nsales users, support users.\n\n348\n00:19:48.054 --> 00:19:51.890\nAnd again, the layouts are tied to\nthe different record types as well.\n\n349\n00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:55.500\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead, and\nlast time we had already added it,\n\n350\n00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.370\nbut I'm not gonna add it this time.\n\n351\n00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:58.765\nJust to show you the drag and drop.\n\n352\n00:19:58.765 --> 00:20:02.839\nAnd Opportunity Teams.\n\n353\n00:20:02.839 --> 00:20:07.097\nSo now as we go into the same record,\nI'm gonna scroll and\n\n354\n00:20:07.097 --> 00:20:09.504\nlook at all of our related list.\n\n355\n00:20:09.504 --> 00:20:13.570\nAnd we actually have this\nhere to add your team role.\n\n356\n00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:14.510\nWhat is a role?\n\n357\n00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.250\nThis is our executive sponsor for\n\n358\n00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:21.250\nthis opportunity,\nthis is a sales manager, sales rep.\n\n359\n00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:25.480\nMe being the record owner, or\nmaybe me having access to this record\n\n360\n00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:29.770\nbecause of a role hierarchy, or somewhere\nwhere I sit along that hierarchy.\n\n361\n00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:35.570\nAgain, anyone with access to this,\ncan go in, if this is enabled,\n\n362\n00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:41.060\nand add a user and\ngive them the read/write access, here.\n\n363\n00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.610\n&gt;&gt; All right, fantastic, Felicia.\n\n364\n00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:45.520\nGreat look there,\nat opportunities within Salesforce.\n\n365\n00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.123\nWhat they are, and\nwhat we can do with those.\n\n366\n00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:49.290\nWe thank you for that.\n\n367\n00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.600\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n368\n00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.710\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV.\n\n369\n00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.590\nI've been your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n370\n00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:55.372\n&gt;&gt; I'm

00:00:06.525\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:08.350\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.365\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.365 --> 00:00:12.895\n&gt;&gt; Hello.\n\n7\n00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:16.258\nWelcome to another exciting\nepisode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.258 --> 00:00:17.676\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\n\n9\n00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:20.578\ntoday we're doing our\nSalesforce Certified Administrator.\n\n10\n00:00:20.578 --> 00:00:24.818\nIn this episode we're actually continuing\nour thought process on opportunities.\n\n11\n00:00:24.818 --> 00:00:29.513\nWe're gonna take a look at the way we can\nassociate opportunities with products and\n\n12\n00:00:29.513 --> 00:00:31.065\nprices, and price books.\n\n13\n00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:33.785\nAnd here to help us with\nthat is Miss Felicia Duarte.\n\n14\n00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:34.900\nWelcome, Felicia.\n\n15\n00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.837\n&gt;&gt; Great, thank you.\n\n16\n00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:39.857\nSo in today's episode I want to carry\non the conversation of opportunities.\n\n17\n00:00:39.857 --> 00:00:44.450\nAnd then associating products to\nopportunities, how do you do that?\n\n18\n00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.470\nWhat do I do if I have tiered pricing for\nmy products?\n\n19\n00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.860\nSo, I'm gonna show you\nthe associations today.\n\n20\n00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.140\nBut to start, I do wanna pick up and\n\n21\n00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.830\nshow you, one more thing in creating an\nopportunity and how to make those private.\n\n22\n00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.743\nSo, you do have the option as you go into\nan opportunity record to have private\n\n23\n00:01:02.743 --> 00:01:03.886\nopportunities.\n\n24\n00:01:03.886 --> 00:01:06.737\nAnd so, that means maybe there's\na list of opportunities.\n\n25\n00:01:06.737 --> 00:01:09.842\nThat maybe by the sharing or\nsecurity defaults,\n\n26\n00:01:09.842 --> 00:01:12.048\nsomeone might have access to you.\n\n27\n00:01:12.048 --> 00:01:15.959\nOr you want to create your own,\nthat necessarily needs to be private.\n\n28\n00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:18.324\nSo if you make that accessible,\n\n29\n00:01:18.324 --> 00:01:23.943\nall you have to simply do is check off\nPrivate within Salesforce [INAUDIBLE].\n\n30\n00:01:23.943 --> 00:01:26.485\nIf you go back over into\nyour home page here,\n\n31\n00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:30.620\nyou can see a list of all of your\nopportunities that are marked Private.\n\n32\n00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.360\nRight now we don't have any but\nthat goes to show you in a list view.\n\n33\n00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.090\nWhat are some of the standard list\nviews that Salesforce gives you?\n\n34\n00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.990\nThese are the ones that\nwe suggest on having.\n\n35\n00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.359\nSo private opportunities, your pipeline.\n\n36\n00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.051\nNew opportunities that were created,\nstock opportunities is also a great one.\n\n37\n00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:57.500\nSo, that's just taking it back there but\nnow let's get into associating products.\n\n38\n00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.263\nSo, in my last episode I said for\nanything that you wanna hold detail in\n\n39\n00:02:02.263 --> 00:02:06.891\nyour opportunity, you leave that\nin the opportunity page layout.\n\n40\n00:02:06.891 --> 00:02:12.227\nBut when you're associating products that\nyou wanna keep track of or report on.\n\n41\n00:02:12.227 --> 00:02:16.315\nYou wanna have them live in its own\nline item, which is considered Products.\n\n42\n00:02:16.315 --> 00:02:18.717\nSo I moved up here, Products.\n\n43\n00:02:18.717 --> 00:02:23.483\nIt was not originally on the layouts\nthat we were using up into the tabs.\n\n44\n00:02:23.483 --> 00:02:28.250\nBecause this is for maybe anyone\nwho's within a retail industry.\n\n45\n00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.730\nI just think of that as being\nthe one I see the most often,\n\n46\n00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.160\nor anyone who provides\nany type of service.\n\n47\n00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.040\nYou may need to navigate quickly to\nyour products or see a list of them.\n\n48\n00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.420\nSo I brought that up here,\nin that instance.\n\n49\n00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.690\nAnd in Price Books as well,\nwhich we'll cover next.\n\n50\n00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.232\nSo let's go into an existing\nopportunity that Salesforce has, so\n\n51\n00:02:47.232 --> 00:02:50.570\nBurlington Textiles\nWeaving Plant Generator.\n\n52\n00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.592\nLong word.\n\n53\n00:02:51.592 --> 00:02:52.328\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n54\n00:02:52.328 --> 00:02:53.436\n&gt;&gt; But right now we can\n\n55\n00:02:53.436 --> 00:02:57.740\nsee within this opportunity I see\nan order number, current generators.\n\n56\n00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.980\nThis here is just a text field.\n\n57\n00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.670\nIf there's a tracking number that I wanna\nrelate specific to this opportunity,\n\n58\n00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.230\nthis can live here, but\nwhat about the details of a record?\n\n59\n00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.270\nWhat about the products within it?\n\n60\n00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.240\nWhat if, and I have some instances\nwhere different products are being\n\n61\n00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.310\nfulfilled at different times within\nthe same opportunity or order.\n\n62\n00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.300\nSo, that information will need\nto live within its own product.\n\n63\n00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.350\nFirst, if I select Add Product.\n\n64\n00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.670\nGreat, so here we have the selection\nto add products to this opportunity.\n\n65\n00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.790\nSo, if I want to select\nthese two products here,\n\n66\n00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.870\nwhat we're looking at is\na list of the products.\n\n67\n00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.380\nWe can see the product code,\n\n68\n00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.580\nthe list price, if there was a description\nor if it belonged to a product family.\n\n69\n00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.080\nThose details would live here.\n\n70\n00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.830\nBut right now I just wanna select\nthese three products here.\n\n71\n00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.730\nAnd they do look similar.\n\n72\n00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.386\nGenWatt Diesel 100 versus\nGenWatt Diesel 10.\n\n73\n00:04:00.386 --> 00:04:04.144\nYou wanna have your products\nseparated if there is\n\n74\n00:04:04.144 --> 00:04:08.896\na different price maybe by the quantity or\nthe amount ordered.\n\n75\n00:04:08.896 --> 00:04:14.104\nSo this is a good example on how\nto start creating the products.\n\n76\n00:04:14.104 --> 00:04:18.280\nAnd this is gonna matter and it's\ngonna look similar to a lot of DBSync,\n\n77\n00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.891\nQuickBooks connections.\n\n78\n00:04:19.891 --> 00:04:24.360\nThat you want your products to ultimately\nmatch if you are gonna do some sort of\n\n79\n00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.240\nintegration with accounting.\n\n80\n00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.215\nSo this is a great example that Salesforce\ngives you on how to set up your products.\n\n81\n00:04:31.215 --> 00:04:36.896\nSo right now we're gonna\nselect these two and\n\n82\n00:04:36.896 --> 00:04:39.895\nI'm go and hit Select.\n\n83\n00:04:39.895 --> 00:04:42.160\n[LAUGH] The very top of my page here.\n\n84\n00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.490\nSo at this point, for this product,\nwhat is the quantity?\n\n85\n00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.570\nSo this is the sales\nprice that you have here.\n\n86\n00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.370\nI'm just gonna select 1, 5, and 5.\n\n87\n00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.240\nAnd those highlighted in red,\nthose are the required fields,\n\n88\n00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.270\nthe fields you have to enter.\n\n89\n00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.200\nIt has to have a sales price.\n\n90\n00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.670\nAnother thing important to know,\n\n91\n00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.350\nyou can't have $0 as your price,\nit has to be an amount greater than 0.\n\n92\n00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.490\nThe date, if you wanted to enter,\nand line description.\n\n93\n00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.050\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and select Save.\n\n94\n00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.850\nThese are just the details at this point\nthat I have right now in this product.\n\n95\n00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:24.529\nAnd each of those are considered\nopportunity product line items.\n\n96\n00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:27.297\nSo these are the products\nyou can see here.\n\n97\n00:05:27.297 --> 00:05:31.050\nThis is the one quantity,\nthis is the sales price for this.\n\n98\n00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.440\nAnd what Salesforce will do is\nit will take that amount and\n\n99\n00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.560\nit will automatically update\nthe Amount field here for you.\n\n100\n00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.641\nSo you can see here within your\nopportunity, this is now locked.\n\n101\n00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:47.837\nOnce you add products to the opportunity\nit's gonna auto calculate that for\n\n102\n00:05:47.837 --> 00:05:49.306\nyou and lock it down.\n\n103\n00:05:49.306 --> 00:05:52.883\nSo, it's taking in the quantity\ntimes the sales price and\n\n104\n00:05:52.883 --> 00:05:55.800\nadding all these products together.\n\n105\n00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.970\nSo, if I wanted to select,\n\n106\n00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.300\nlet's say we have an example of\ncustomers that have tiered pricing.\n\n107\n00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.350\nMaybe you have some customers that fall\nunder your gold, or your bronze, or\n\n108\n00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.250\naggressive versus standard pricing.\n\n109\n00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.820\nYou want to have a list\nof all your products and\n\n110\n00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.780\nbe able to break down those\ndifferent prices per product.\n\n111\n00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.700\nSo you're gonna wanna create a price book.\n\n112\n00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.520\nSo, think of this as\nyour master price list.\n\n113\n00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.610\nRight now,\nSalesforce gives you standard price book.\n\n114\n00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.250\nAnd this is taking in all the products.\n\n115\n00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.100\nRight now we're gonna see a list of all\nthe products that Salesforce created\n\n116\n00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.170\njust for this developer edition.\n\n117\n00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.051\nAnd if I hit Go To List I'm\nin my standard price book and\n\n118\n00:06:38.051 --> 00:06:42.645\nthese are a list of all my products\nwith what that list price is.\n\n119\n00:06:42.645 --> 00:06:46.447\nSo let's say I wanna add,\nand I'm gonna hit back,\n\n120\n00:06:46.447 --> 00:06:49.875\nI wanna add a different price book.\n\n121\n00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:54.380\nSo if we need to make changes to\nthe standard price book, I can do so here.\n\n122\n00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.503\nBut this is the only active\nprice book at this moment.\n\n123\n00:06:57.503 --> 00:07:02.375\nSo let's go back into the Price Book\nhomepage, and select New.\n\n124\n00:07:02.375 --> 00:07:08.007\nSo let's call this one Aggressive.\n\n125\n00:07:08.007 --> 00:07:11.175\nAnd if there was a description\nfeel free to enter a description.\n\n126\n00:07:11.175 --> 00:07:13.671\nOf course, the more details often,\nthe better.\n\n127\n00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:15.776\nAnd I want to get this\nstarted right away so\n\n128\n00:07:15.776 --> 00:07:18.191\nI'm going to make it\nactive at this point here.\n\n129\n00:07:18.191 --> 00:07:22.079\nIs there an existing price book\nthat I want to clone from?\n\n130\n00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:24.420\nSo I can use Standard,\nor standard price book.\n\n131\n00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.898\nThese are the existing price books\nthat we have right now, and hit Save.\n\n132\n00:07:28.898 --> 00:07:31.372\nSo it's going to pull in\nall those details for\n\n133\n00:07:31.372 --> 00:07:34.030\nthis new price book that we've created.\n\n134\n00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.910\nIt's adding all the products already.\n\n135\n00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.440\nThe products have to be active.\n\n136\n00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.113\nAnd in order for this price book to show\nup when you're creating opportunities.\n\n137\n00:07:43.113 --> 00:07:46.722\nThe price book and products within it,\nthey all have to be active.\n\n138\n00:07:46.722 --> 00:07:51.577\nAnd at least one product has to be\nassociated to a price book in order to\n\n139\n00:07:51.577 --> 00:07:52.761\nmake it active.\n\n140\n00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:57.738\nSo if you started backwards and you didn't\nuse or have any products existing first,\n\n141\n00:07:57.738 --> 00:08:00.345\nprice book won't matter at this point yet.\n\n142\n00:08:00.345 --> 00:08:04.950\nSo, within this price book\nyou can make changes here.\n\n143\n00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.050\nBut if you go within the price book\nthat we're in, so we're in Aggressive.\n\n144\n00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.895\nYou see all the products here.\n\n145\n00:08:10.895 --> 00:08:15.017\nYou can certainly add at this point if\nthere were new products that only lived in\n\n146\n00:08:15.017 --> 00:08:16.776\none price book and not the other.\n\n147\n00:08:16.776 --> 00:08:21.670\nBut you can make changes at this\npoint here to the line items.\n\n148\n00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.630\nSo, for this one in this price book.\n\n149\n00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.624\nWe can see here aggressive,\nso we know where we're at.\n\n150\n00:08:26.624 --> 00:08:33.049\nWe can see for which product, what is the\nlist price, what is the standard price?\n\n151\n00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:36.864\nThis is standard prices pulling\nin from that master price book.\n\n152\n00:08:36.864 --> 00:08:40.079\nAnd then the list price is how it\nchanges in the multiple price books that\n\n153\n00:08:40.079 --> 00:08:40.760\nyou can have.\n\n154\n00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.730\nSo this way when you go\nback into an opportunity,\n\n155\n00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.680\nlet's go into one that we do not\nhave products associated to it.\n\n156\n00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:56.675\nYou can say, and you can only select one\nprice book for one given opportunity.\n\n157\n00:08:56.675 --> 00:09:01.847\nSo you can't select different\nprice books for one opportunity.\n\n158\n00:09:01.847 --> 00:09:06.646\nSo you want to select Choose Price Book.\n\n159\n00:09:06.646 --> 00:09:11.718\nAnd this is for an aggressive sale.\n\n160\n00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:18.750\nSo maybe my prices are little more\naggressive than my standard price book.\n\n161\n00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.126\nSo now we can see here\nwhat price book we are in.\n\n162\n00:09:22.126 --> 00:09:26.908\nAnd as we select products, it's only\ngonna pull from that price book here,\n\n163\n00:09:26.908 --> 00:09:30.140\nwith those prices that we edited and\nmade changes.\n\n164\n00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.504\nSo that's going to show you\nthe relationship between tiered pricing,\n\n165\n00:09:34.504 --> 00:09:37.352\nproducts, associating them to price books.\n\n166\n00:09:37.352 --> 00:09:41.976\nAnd then keep in mind, as we go into\nin the future episodes, data import.\n\n167\n00:09:41.976 --> 00:09:47.790\nIt is a three-step import process if\nyou do want to import price books and\n\n168\n00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:48.755\nproducts.\n\n169\n00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:52.568\nWith that example, and\nassociate them to opportunities.\n\n170\n00:09:52.568 --> 00:09:56.172\nSo now when you go into an opportunity and\n\n171\n00:09:56.172 --> 00:10:00.839\nyou wanna generate a report\noff of all the products.\n\n172\n00:10:00.839 --> 00:10:03.629\nYou are able to collect the data and\nhave line items and\n\n173\n00:10:03.629 --> 00:10:06.426\nyou can have custom fields\nlive within the products.\n\n174\n00:10:06.426 --> 00:10:09.063\nYou can have formula fields\nwithin those products.\n\n175\n00:10:09.063 --> 00:10:13.347\nAnd we have seen a lot of custom\ndevelopment using opportunities and\n\n176\n00:10:13.347 --> 00:10:15.912\nopportunity line items with products.\n\n177\n00:10:15.912 --> 00:10:21.475\nRather than just a standard large text\nfield of data within the opportunity.\n\n178\n00:10:21.475 --> 00:10:26.736\nYou can get pretty granular in your\nreporting when you break it up this way.\n\n179\n00:10:26.736 --> 00:10:31.553\nAnd it's a two step process when\nyou do have to add products.\n\n180\n00:10:31.553 --> 00:10:36.600\nBut it's the best way and\nthe right way to report on your products.\n\n181\n00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:38.730\n&gt;&gt; All right, Felicia.\n\n182\n00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:40.060\nFantastic stuff, there.\n\n183\n00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.206\nAnd that's one of the places I think I see\na lot of people struggle with sometimes,\n\n184\n00:10:43.206 --> 00:10:44.295\nor organizations.\n\n185\n00:10:44.295 --> 00:10:47.810\nThey'll have different price points for\ndifferent customers.\n\n186\n00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.000\nBut then nobody seems\nto be on the same page.\n\n187\n00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.400\nSo now, with a different price list,\n\n188\n00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.240\nwe can make sure that everybody\nis on that same page.\n\n189\n00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:54.930\nWhen we say, okay.\n\n190\n00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:56.230\nWe're going to go with an aggressive sale.\n\n191\n00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.040\nWell, what what was our price for that?\n\n192\n00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.219\nWell now we all know.\n\n193\n00:10:59.219 --> 00:11:02.562\nSo fantastic, we appreciate that look\nat opportunities and price books.\n\n194\n00:11:02.562 --> 00:11:05.443\nAnd how we can differentiate different\nprices for different customers.\n\n195\n00:11:05.443 --> 00:11:06.350\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n196\n00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.018\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n197\n00:11:08.018 --> 00:11:11.242\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n198\n00:11:11.242 --> 00:11:12.218\n&gt;&gt; And I'm

Duarte.\n\n10\n00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.780\nWelcome back, Felicia.\n\n11\n00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.310\n&gt;&gt; Great, I'm happy to go\nover the largest chunk that\n\n12\n00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.280\nis covered in the Salesforce\ncertified admin exam.\n\n13\n00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.180\nAnd that is standard and custom objects.\n\n14\n00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.600\nSo this topic will include everything\nfrom the details of the fields,\n\n15\n00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.870\ncreating new fields,\ncreating a custom object.\n\n16\n00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.875\nI'm gonna get into every single one of the\ncustom fields that you can create within\n\n17\n00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:58.470\nSalesforce, because a lot of the questions\npertain to that and what you can do.\n\n18\n00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.070\nThe differences between a master detail\nrelationship and a look up relationship,\n\n19\n00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.290\nhow to change pick list values or\nwhat formula fields and\n\n20\n00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.580\nall those different types of fields\nthat you have when you're creating a new\n\n21\n00:01:11.945 --> 00:01:15.115\nobject or fields within the objects.\n\n22\n00:01:15.115 --> 00:01:19.305\nSo let's get started and then we're gonna\ngo ahead and start with the opportunities\n\n23\n00:01:19.305 --> 00:01:22.765\nand just the definition, I'm sorry just\nthe objects, and just the definition as\n\n24\n00:01:22.765 --> 00:01:26.580\na whole is think of your objects which\nyou'll hear of often as database\n\n25\n00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.270\ntables that can hold some of these records\nor groups of records of information.\n\n26\n00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.670\nSo we're gonna start with the process\nof creating a new custom object.\n\n27\n00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.700\nSo what we've discovered\nin some of our previous\n\n28\n00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.260\nepisodes is everything you see up here.\n\n29\n00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.420\nThose are standard Salesforce objects.\n\n30\n00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.140\nWe have yet\nto create in any episode a new object.\n\n31\n00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.070\nSo let's go ahead and do that.\n\n32\n00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.180\nFrom our set up button.\n\n33\n00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.760\nSo I'm gonna create, and this is\ngoing to live in a different section\n\n34\n00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.450\nthan what we're used to\nnavigating to within Salesforce.\n\n35\n00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.030\nSo I'm just going to select,\nor search for, objects.\n\n36\n00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.810\nAnd now, that option is going to live\nwithin the create section of Salesforce,\n\n37\n00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.650\nand it's going to live within its\nown bucket of custom objects.\n\n38\n00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.300\nSo I'm going to select.\n\n39\n00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.600\nNew custom object.\n\n40\n00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.860\nI'm gonna use the example,\nlet's say that we're in a real estate, and\n\n41\n00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.280\nlet's use utilized properties.\n\n42\n00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.150\nI want to be able to record data,\n\n43\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.730\njust like you would in another database\ntable of property information.\n\n44\n00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.110\nSo what is the label?\n\n45\n00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.310\nWhat should that look\nlike at the very top?\n\n46\n00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.631\nSo I'm gonna create property.\n\n47\n00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:36.770\nWhat is the plural label?\n\n48\n00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:37.390\nProperties.\n\n49\n00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.410\nDoes it start with a vowel sound?\n\n50\n00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.580\nNo, it does not.\n\n51\n00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.950\nAnd if there's a description,\nfeel free to add the description below.\n\n52\n00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.240\nSo, these are the basic details here,\n\n53\n00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.740\nwe have the option of opening up a window\nusing visual force page, if you need to,\n\n54\n00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.900\nif there is more heavy custom\ndevelopment done and right now,\n\n55\n00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.330\nwe're just gonna stick with what\nyou need to know to pass the exam.\n\n56\n00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.020\nSo right now,\nwe've entered a property name.\n\n57\n00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.360\nThis information here is gonna auto fill.\n\n58\n00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.730\nYou have two different\ntypes of date types, so,\n\n59\n00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.450\ndo you need it to be an auto number,\nor a text.\n\n60\n00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.040\nRight now,\n\n61\n00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.770\nif you wanted to give it a property name,\nI'm just gonna keep it as a text field.\n\n62\n00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.940\nOr maybe there are instances like\nfinancial account information is\n\n63\n00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.690\na good example of a object\nthat may need an auto number\n\n64\n00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.960\nrather than a text field to get started.\n\n65\n00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.880\nSo I have the option.\n\n66\n00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.400\nI usually prefer to select most of these\nif it's not a junction object which we'll\n\n67\n00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.960\ngo through, but\nI want to be able to report on this.\n\n68\n00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.340\nI want to be able to keep track of\nactivities done against the report.\n\n69\n00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.410\nSo all of the same features and\n\n70\n00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.310\nfunctionalities that you can\nhave with a standard object.\n\n71\n00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.920\nYou can have with a custom object.\n\n72\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.630\nI want to be able to track field history.\n\n73\n00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.740\nThis might be for\nproperty information in this example.\n\n74\n00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.650\nAnd if we have chatter\nenabled I want to allow\n\n75\n00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.340\naccess in Chatter groups for\nthis custom object.\n\n76\n00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.440\nSo, we're selecting all those features.\n\n77\n00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.180\nAnd then this is some information\nregarding the API access\n\n78\n00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.830\nif this is something that\nyou're integrating and using.\n\n79\n00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.250\nRight now we're just going to go to\nthe other topics here which is deployment.\n\n80\n00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.430\nYes, I want to deploy it and use it now\nand make it available, and then search.\n\n81\n00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.060\nDo you want this, the records and\nthe data, in here to be searchable?\n\n82\n00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.130\nSo I'm gonna select Allow Search and\n\n83\n00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.960\nI want the same functionality\nto Add Notes and Attachments.\n\n84\n00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.560\nIf this is something you would like\nto showcase up here at the very top,\n\n85\n00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.060\nyou want to select Launch New Custom Tab.\n\n86\n00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.630\nOtherwise, you're going back in and\n\n87\n00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.090\ndoing more clicks than you need to if\nyou don't select it and you forget.\n\n88\n00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.860\nSo i'm just gonna select save, and\nwhat this will do is, because I typed off\n\n89\n00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.528\nthat box now it's gonna take me to\nthe option of creating a new tab.\n\n90\n00:04:51.528 --> 00:04:56.940\nSo every new object that\nis displayed up here has to\n\n91\n00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.040\nhave the identifier that\ntab style associated to it.\n\n92\n00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.590\nSo we're going to select tab style.\n\n93\n00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.360\nThis is something you have to choose and\nall these fine icons to go through and\n\n94\n00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.715\nif we're talking properties, I'm going\nto look for maybe a home or the castle.\n\n95\n00:05:14.715 --> 00:05:15.735\nThis one sticks out for me.\n\n96\n00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:19.455\nWhatever's relevant to the information\nyou're looking to collect.\n\n97\n00:05:19.455 --> 00:05:24.205\nAnd this is just again, your quick way for\nyour other users to know where to navigate\n\n98\n00:05:24.205 --> 00:05:29.435\nto when they're in the quick find section\nor going to the last places they visited.\n\n99\n00:05:29.435 --> 00:05:31.705\nSo that's going to showcase here.\n\n100\n00:05:31.705 --> 00:05:34.390\nWe don't have any custom\npages to add to it.\n\n101\n00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.810\nI'm not gonna include a description,\nand I'm gonna select Next.\n\n102\n00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.050\nAnd who do you want this visible to?\n\n103\n00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.290\nRight now the default is on and\nset for all of these profiles here.\n\n104\n00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.760\nIf I wanted to change who\nhas access by the profile,\n\n105\n00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.960\nI can go ahead and\nmake those hidden or visible.\n\n106\n00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.510\nRight now lets make it\ndefault to everyone, so\n\n107\n00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.190\neveryone has access to this object.\n\n108\n00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:07.820\nI'm gonna select Next, and if I wanted to\ninclude it based off apps that I'm in.\n\n109\n00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.280\nSo in one of the earlier videos,\nwe went through whether it was for\n\n110\n00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.560\nsomeone who has a sales app, or\nthe marketing app, or sales app.\n\n111\n00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.230\nShould they all have access to it?\n\n112\n00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.830\nBy default, everything is included as yes.\n\n113\n00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.560\nSo we'll keep it that way right now.\n\n114\n00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.450\nAnd select Save.\n\n115\n00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.630\nSo now this takes us to the custom object.\n\n116\n00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.560\nIt's using the name that we selected for\nproperty.\n\n117\n00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.360\nAnd you can see here it's gonna\ntake the plural version and\n\n118\n00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.350\nplace it up here at\nthe very top of property.\n\n119\n00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.840\nSo now you have a quick way to access and\nnavigate up here, and\n\n120\n00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.510\nit's just gonna give you\nfour standard field.\n\n121\n00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:48.470\nSo, you're gonna have the created by,\nlast modified, the owner of the record,\n\n122\n00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.760\nand then what we selected,\nwhich was property name in a text field.\n\n123\n00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.180\nOtherwise, it would have\nbeen an auto name or number,\n\n124\n00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.780\nand it would have been an auto\ngenerated number here.\n\n125\n00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.922\nBut in this example we don't need one.\n\n126\n00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:10.193\nSo let me think, let's go ahead and create\na new custom field an enter it here.\n\n127\n00:07:10.193 --> 00:07:12.942\nAnd you want this related\nto the property itself.\n\n128\n00:07:12.942 --> 00:07:17.750\nSo maybe it's a property location or\nlet's go and\n\n129\n00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.819\ndefine and\ncreate some of those custom fields here.\n\n130\n00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.000\nSo as I selected new,\n\n131\n00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.630\nyou also noticed that those were\nconsidered a standard fields.\n\n132\n00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.800\nNow we're going to get into custom fields.\n\n133\n00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.310\nSo these are all of your examples\nof the type of fields that you can\n\n134\n00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.170\ncreate within Salesforce.\n\n135\n00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:36.330\nSo if I did need to generate\nsome sort of auto number.\n\n136\n00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.680\nMaybe for invoices or\ninvoicing that's common.\n\n137\n00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.930\nI would select an autonumber and\nit's gonna generate a sequence number.\n\n138\n00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:46.681\nSo let's just use that as an example.\n\n139\n00:07:46.681 --> 00:07:51.447\nBecause I do wanna get into each one\nof these, so you know when or where,\n\n140\n00:07:51.447 --> 00:07:56.706\nwhat they can do and Because they are\nquestions that are common that do come up.\n\n141\n00:07:56.706 --> 00:07:58.400\nSo auto-number gene being one of them.\n\n142\n00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.330\nLet's just name this,\n\n143\n00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:04.330\neven though it doesn't relate\nnecessarily to the property, it could.\n\n144\n00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.970\nBut we're gonna say Invoice Number,\nI'm gonna select tab,\n\n145\n00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.790\nit's gonna generate the API name and\nthen the display format here.\n\n146\n00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.850\nSo for an auto-generated number.\n\n147\n00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.690\nWhat is a format that you wanna keep?\n\n148\n00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:20.580\nIs it i for invoice, or\nthe letter that you select.\n\n149\n00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.580\nAnd I like to use this,\n\n150\n00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:27.880\nit's helpful, if you select what is this\nit will give you the display formats.\n\n151\n00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.420\nSo maybe you wanna keep track of,\n\n152\n00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.540\nI usually like to go\nwith something like this.\n\n153\n00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:37.490\nI just copy that over, and\n\n154\n00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:42.060\npaste it over, and just do the i.\n\n155\n00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.970\nAnd now it's gonna take in this list here.\n\n156\n00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:48.510\nSo this is helpful, you can kind of use\nyour own but this will give you an example\n\n157\n00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:53.490\nof what kind of formatting you can use\nIf you want it with leading zeroes,\n\n158\n00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:59.690\nwithout, no formatting or\nadd this here and substitute.\n\n159\n00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:04.190\nOtherwise it will generate it for\nyou based off what was by default.\n\n160\n00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.160\nAnd the Starting Number maybe I'm\nstarting after a certain number\n\n161\n00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.280\nif I'm pushing in historical information.\n\n162\n00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.100\nMaybe this is my first one and\nI want it to start now.\n\n163\n00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:17.620\nYou can choose to generate an auto\nnumber for records that already exist.\n\n164\n00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.080\nBut we don't need that option right now.\n\n165\n00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.690\nSo I'm not gonna select it.\n\n166\n00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.010\nAnd your description and help text.\n\n167\n00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.150\nSo your help text is what we'll\ndisplay to your end-user.\n\n168\n00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.220\nSo, they're not sure what\nth formula is meant for.\n\n169\n00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.350\nThey will see something similar to this.\n\n170\n00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.010\nWhere they can hover over and\n\n171\n00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:38.890\nyou describe what they need to know to\nenter the right data in that field.\n\n172\n00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:43.370\nSo, if this information is being used\nwhere you need to capture an external ID,\n\n173\n00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.600\nyou select this as being your external ID.\n\n174\n00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:53.130\nThe same way this works, usually an auto\nnumber is generated as being unique.\n\n175\n00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:58.960\nYou can select external ID in any existing\nstandard object in Salesforce as well.\n\n176\n00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.580\nYou can go back into those fields and say,\nhey these fields here are my external IDs.\n\n177\n00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.640\nSo I'm going to select Next.\n\n178\n00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:12.790\nAnd then at this point right here you have\nthe option of the field level security\n\n179\n00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:13.820\nbased on the profile.\n\n180\n00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.430\nAnd you'll see this for\nevery time you create a new field.\n\n181\n00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.320\nSo is this accessible for everyone?\n\n182\n00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.330\nIs it read only?\n\n183\n00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.010\nWhat kind of properties\ndo you want to give them?\n\n184\n00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:27.620\nThese are some partner users,\nwhich for the most part,\n\n185\n00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.540\nif you're not utilizing\npartners you won't see.\n\n186\n00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.020\nBut right now it's visible for\neveryone and\n\n187\n00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:38.980\nI can just select this box at the top\nto then make those changes here.\n\n188\n00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.030\nSo I'm gonna select Next.\n\n189\n00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:46.070\nAnd another point too is that you saw that\nthat was an auto generated number, so\n\n190\n00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.840\nit is automatically gonna be a read only\n\n191\n00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.280\nbecause you can't make\nchanges to that number.\n\n192\n00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.010\nSo the third prompt here is you have\nthe option of adding this field.\n\n193\n00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.110\nSo you can create this field.\n\n194\n00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.480\nBy default it adds it to the layout.\n\n195\n00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.130\nBut you have the option of creating it and\n\n196\n00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.750\nnot making it visible or\non the layout itself.\n\n197\n00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.620\nSo, I'm just gonna hit Save.\n\n198\n00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.550\nBut I can also hit Save and New.\n\n199\n00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.870\nSo, I'm gonna show you Save.\n\n200\n00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:17.100\nAnd Save A New is a great way to\nkind of create fields on the fly.\n\n201\n00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:18.530\nSo for this one you can now see.\n\n202\n00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.760\nNow it's gonna lay in my custom fields and\nrelationships.\n\n203\n00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.760\nSo let's create a new type of field here.\n\n204\n00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.990\nSo we have auto number which we went over,\nand then formulas.\n\n205\n00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.446\nSo maybe there's an age,\n\n206\n00:11:36.252 --> 00:11:40.716\nCommon that we see on the opportunity,\nI mean you can get, let's go ahead and\n\n207\n00:11:40.716 --> 00:11:44.030\ngo with age of the opportunity,\nI'm sorry, property.\n\n208\n00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.230\nAnd you have your different types\nof formulas that you can return, so\n\n209\n00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:55.510\nyou can return a date, a text formula,\npercent, number, currency and check box.\n\n210\n00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.830\nIt's a good idea to know when you're\nnot gonna get a lot questions.\n\n211\n00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.440\nYou'll get more questions as\nfar as the type of formulas.\n\n212\n00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.610\nBut for more advanced questions\nas far as building formulas or\n\n213\n00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:12.290\neven building apex triggers, that's seeing\nmore and some of the other more advanced\n\n214\n00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:16.240\ncertification courses in exams, so\nthis won't be on it, but they will,\n\n215\n00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:21.040\nthere were still gonna be questions as far\nas what types of formulas you have, and\n\n216\n00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:27.260\nnot necessarily how to create the formula,\nbut where to go and what it does.\n\n217\n00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.080\nSo we'll just go into age, and\nI'll show you what that would look like.\n\n218\n00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.630\nI didn't select a formula return type,\nand that is a required field.\n\n219\n00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.160\nSo, using age,\nwe're gonna go with a number.\n\n220\n00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.990\nWhere I wanna be able to see the age.\n\n221\n00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.630\nAnd right now we're in property, but\nlet's use the example of opportunity.\n\n222\n00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:51.920\nSo the age that's most common is from when\nthe record was created til today's date.\n\n223\n00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.500\nSo it's not a currency number, I don't\nneed to collect any decimal places.\n\n224\n00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.430\nSo I'm gonna keep it at 0 and select Next.\n\n225\n00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.570\nNow you have the option here if\nyou know how to write formulas,\n\n226\n00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:05.150\nyou can write it straight from\nhere from the simple formula.\n\n227\n00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:09.830\nI use the advanced formula to help me be\nable to pull from deals within Salesforce.\n\n228\n00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.330\nAnd it's an easy way to kind of build\nout to these real simple formulas.\n\n229\n00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.000\nAnd you use this as an example here.\n\n230\n00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.870\nSo these are som of your function\ncategories you have you can do\n\n231\n00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:23.940\ndate to time, math, text, case types.\n\n232\n00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:29.278\nI mean you can do all these here within\nthe formula field in Salesforce.\n\n233\n00:13:29.278 --> 00:13:33.610\nSo, just to show you the properties\nof building out of formula,\n\n234\n00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.140\nyou can pull from any of the objects,\nright now we're in that property object.\n\n235\n00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:41.470\nSo there's not gonna be much\nto work off in this example.\n\n236\n00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:47.390\nIf I had lookup relationships or master\ndetail relationships to another object.\n\n237\n00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:53.190\nSo if there was a relationship in this\nobject to an account or to an opportunity\n\n238\n00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:59.590\nI can proof from those fields here and\nhave a relationship to owner object.\n\n239\n00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:04.080\nAnd I can pull those tubes here so\nthat I can start building up my formula.\n\n240\n00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.220\nI can't do this before anything\nbecause I was looking for\n\n241\n00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.560\nopportunity but\nthis will pull on date seal.\n\n242\n00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.770\nAnd if you want to start pulling and\n\n243\n00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:16.090\ngenerating numbers you can\ncall me maybe on Tuesday.\n\n244\n00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.460\nMinus that date field to generate\nthe map that you're looking for.\n\n245\n00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:23.270\nSo you can find this over here,\nthis will help you with your map.\n\n246\n00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:26.000\nYou can just enter today and\n\n247\n00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.440\nI'll show you what that apex\nlooks like within Salesforce.\n\n248\n00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.080\nYou do the math.\n\n249\n00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.210\nBut this one's not gonna work.\n\n250\n00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:36.310\nI just wanted to show you the where\nin Salesforce to do those formulas.\n\n251\n00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.820\nAnd then you can check everything here.\n\n252\n00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.380\nBut This one will error out.\n\n253\n00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:44.190\nAnd the description and\nhelp text in the formula field.\n\n254\n00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:47.890\nThat just gives you some good, a good\nidea of what you can do, where to go.\n\n255\n00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.630\nBut let's hop over to\nsome other field types.\n\n256\n00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:53.950\nI want you to make sure that it is in\nthe right format and the right settings.\n\n257\n00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:56.394\nThen you can save the record and\nit is locked.\n\n258\n00:14:59.449 --> 00:15:03.005\nSo let's go back into objects.\n\n259\n00:15:03.005 --> 00:15:06.260\nAnd we're gonna go into the property\nobject which we were building on.\n\n260\n00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.340\nWe're gonna select new.\n\n261\n00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.510\nSo you have two different types of\nrelationships within Salesforce.\n\n262\n00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:16.430\nYou have the look up relationship and\nthe master detail relationship.\n\n263\n00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.470\nAnd the master detail\nrelationship is a strong tie and\n\n264\n00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:22.180\na strong connection between two objects.\n\n265\n00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:25.190\nSo you have to think of with\nstandard objects in Salesforce.\n\n266\n00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.530\nYou have your accounts and opportunities.\n\n267\n00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.880\nSo you're able to see all the data.\n\n268\n00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.456\nAnd you're able to roll up information\nfrom your opportunities Into your\n\n269\n00:15:34.456 --> 00:15:39.564\naccounts, it's a tighter connection\nbetween those two objects in Salesforce.\n\n270\n00:15:39.564 --> 00:15:43.504\nWhereas look up relationship you're able\nto pull information from two different\n\n271\n00:15:43.504 --> 00:15:46.030\nobjects, but\nyou don't have that roll up summary.\n\n272\n00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:51.958\nYou're not able to collect and\npull data below into Into other objects.\n\n273\n00:15:51.958 --> 00:15:57.006\nAnd so, if a Master Detail relationship,\nif I wanted to create a Master Detail\n\n274\n00:15:57.006 --> 00:16:01.907\nrelationship with properties against\nmy accounts, and there's probably\n\n275\n00:16:01.907 --> 00:16:06.750\ndetails in there that I wanna be able\nto collect and roll up into my account.\n\n276\n00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:10.380\nI wanna select my\nMaster Detail relationship.\n\n277\n00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:15.140\nAnd as you're building out here I would\nutilize this and I would generate\n\n278\n00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.743\nsome flash cards on differences\nbetween the both the Master Detail and\n\n279\n00:16:19.743 --> 00:16:21.396\nLookup Relationships.\n\n280\n00:16:21.396 --> 00:16:25.814\nCuz that's probably one of the most common\nquestions I have seen on the exam itself\n\n281\n00:16:25.814 --> 00:16:28.940\nis the differences between the both here.\n\n282\n00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.787\nSo some notes here that it states\nthe relationship is required,\n\n283\n00:16:32.787 --> 00:16:35.566\nso the difference here\non all detail records,\n\n284\n00:16:35.566 --> 00:16:39.360\nwhereas the Lookup Relationship\nyou don't have to have that.\n\n285\n00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.250\nDiscusses again the role up summary field,\n\n286\n00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:46.820\nwhich is something you can do on a Master\nDetail and not on a Lookup Relationship.\n\n287\n00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:51.780\nAnd then the deletion of a record which\nis different between a Lookup and\n\n288\n00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:52.550\na Master Detail.\n\n289\n00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:59.141\nSo when you delete a master record,\nall details related are deleted.\n\n290\n00:16:59.141 --> 00:17:04.139\nSo again, you can see the differences of\nwhen you would need a Master Detail and\n\n291\n00:17:04.139 --> 00:17:05.740\na Lookup Relationship.\n\n292\n00:17:06.956 --> 00:17:11.830\nAnd then going down,\nwe have the other check boxes and\n\n293\n00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:14.710\ncurrency options that you have there.\n\n294\n00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.640\nCurrency if you had\nenabled multi currency you\n\n295\n00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.450\nwould have more options once\nyou go into the Currency field.\n\n296\n00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:21.831\nLet's go through that here.\n\n297\n00:17:26.377 --> 00:17:27.930\nI'm just gonna enter in an amount.\n\n298\n00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:34.493\nAnd because right now we don't have\nmulti currency set up, but for standard\n\n299\n00:17:34.493 --> 00:17:40.270\ncurrency we're in the US, so we're gonna\nuse 16 length and 2 decimal points.\n\n300\n00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:44.902\nIf there was a description we would\nenter it here, you also at this point,\n\n301\n00:17:44.902 --> 00:17:48.413\nI've see questions on the test\nwhere do you go to enter,\n\n302\n00:17:48.413 --> 00:17:52.670\nmake a field required and\nthat's often a multi select question.\n\n303\n00:17:52.670 --> 00:18:00.342\nSo make sure you know that you can\nalso go to the actual field build-up,\n\n304\n00:18:00.342 --> 00:18:05.520\nfield edit page here, and then you\ncan go to the field level security.\n\n305\n00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.480\nAnd then, to make it required that\nthere's places on the page layout itself,\n\n306\n00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.090\nyou can make the field required.\n\n307\n00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:14.890\nSo, sometimes it does seem like a tricky\nquestion, but make sure that those\n\n308\n00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.760\nare the three places where you can\ngo to make any field required.\n\n309\n00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.880\nSo, if I wanted to on this field, I could.\n\n310\n00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.720\nAnd then, if there was a default formula,\nalways for this field I can use it here.\n\n311\n00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:32.090\nSo, whether it's, right now it'd\nhave to be in the mount field, but\n\n312\n00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:33.370\nthat can be shown in a formula.\n\n313\n00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.170\nSo right now we don't\nneed that required and\n\n314\n00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.420\nwe do not need to enter a formula for it.\n\n315\n00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.300\nI'm just gonna select Visible for\neveryone.\n\n316\n00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.490\nAnd because it is not a formula and\n\n317\n00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:50.540\nit's open text, I'm gonna leave it blank\nand it doesn't need to be read-only.\n\n318\n00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.530\nIt can be read and edit.\n\n319\n00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:55.334\nSo we have everything entered here and\nwe can select Next.\n\n320\n00:18:58.777 --> 00:19:00.430\nAnd do we wanna add it to the layout?\n\n321\n00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.637\nYes.\n\n322\n00:19:02.637 --> 00:19:06.855\nSo on the layout as I'm building\nout these reports for that object,\n\n323\n00:19:06.855 --> 00:19:09.380\nI'm gonna go into my new custom object.\n\n324\n00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.920\nI have nothing to really work from or\n\n325\n00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.670\nuse so as you're building out I create\na test record to check to make sure\n\n326\n00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:22.210\nthat what I'm entering is right.\n\n327\n00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:25.870\nSo I entered an amount and I'm checking\nto make sure I put the right field,\n\n328\n00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.560\nit's not gonna take in text for currency.\n\n329\n00:19:31.345 --> 00:19:35.740\nThat is also a great,\nI'm gonna show you some validation rules.\n\n330\n00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:40.022\nSo it's gonna go based off\nthe field that you chose.\n\n331\n00:19:40.022 --> 00:19:41.617\nSo if you chose a currency fields, so\n\n332\n00:19:41.617 --> 00:19:44.090\nit has to be in that decimal\npoint that we defined it in.\n\n333\n00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:49.640\nYou can have other validations set up\nwithin any field or object in Salesforce.\n\n334\n00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.960\nBut right now, we can see that\nthe fields that we've created,\n\n335\n00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.840\nthere's no sections at this\npoint with this new object.\n\n336\n00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.610\nThe fields would just\ncontinue to fall under here.\n\n337\n00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:01.050\nBut, you start building out\nthe new object that you created,\n\n338\n00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:05.050\nand you do that by visually\nchanging the layout or\n\n339\n00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.990\nyou can continue building on\nthe field that you're in.\n\n340\n00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.360\nNow to without a test record,\n\n341\n00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:15.670\nthe only other way to kind of navigate\nback would be to set up, to search for\n\n342\n00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:19.520\nobjects and then to go into that\ncustom object that you built out.\n\n343\n00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:25.080\nBut I always like to have a test record\nto easily navigate back into the object,\n\n344\n00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.010\nand then continue building\nout some of those fields.\n\n345\n00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.790\nSo we're back here,\nI'm gonna select a New.\n\n346\n00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:34.410\nAnd everything else, for\n\n347\n00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:40.210\nthe most part, unless one catches my mind,\nyou have date, date and time.\n\n348\n00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:46.710\nIf you're looking to generate a report,\nlet's say, I'm sorry, generate a formula\n\n349\n00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.945\nusing two dates, you gotta make sure that\nyou make the date/time just a date field.\n\n350\n00:20:50.945 --> 00:20:56.330\nE-mail field has to be, has validation\nto have a standard e-mail field,\n\n351\n00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.392\nso it has to have the @ on it.\n\n352\n00:20:58.392 --> 00:21:03.570\nGeolocation, so a number,\na number will always have a comma in it.\n\n353\n00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:08.530\nIf you're looking to have a number that\nyou do not want to create that for,\n\n354\n00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:12.970\ncreate that field as a text field,\nand then Picklist and Multi-Select.\n\n355\n00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.130\nSo you can have Multi-Select Picklist,\nyou can have Picklist, but\n\n356\n00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:19.101\nyou can also have depended Picklist.\n\n357\n00:21:19.101 --> 00:21:24.621\nSo if you want one value in that Picklist\nto then show you another field that\n\n358\n00:21:24.621 --> 00:21:29.712\nneeds to be generated from it,\nyou create that relationship here.\n\n359\n00:21:29.712 --> 00:21:33.059\nSo in this one we would first\nhave that Picklist created and\n\n360\n00:21:33.059 --> 00:21:36.560\nthen you create the second Picklist and\ndo that dependency.\n\n361\n00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:42.020\nAnd then as I'm going through\nthis you have about five\n\n362\n00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.970\ndifferent text options to have.\n\n363\n00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:48.850\nSo you can have a text,\na small text box combination that's\n\n364\n00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:53.000\nalpha numeric of letters and numbers and\nthen a text area which is smaller.\n\n365\n00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.760\n255 characters, but for those that need\nto collect or hold more information,\n\n366\n00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.460\nyou wanna go with the long text area.\n\n367\n00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.155\nAnd if you needed to collect\nmaybe an image or a picture,\n\n368\n00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:06.073\nyou can have it sit under\nas a rich text area.\n\n369\n00:22:06.073 --> 00:22:08.540\nSo keep that in mind when\nyou're doing data imports.\n\n370\n00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.550\nAnd know the numbers as far\nas your limitation goes for\n\n371\n00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.660\neach one of these that\ncan be asked on the exam.\n\n372\n00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:19.410\nAnd then also know that when\nyou enter in you store images\n\n373\n00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:23.860\nwithin those rich text fields that\ndoes weigh into your data space too.\n\n374\n00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:29.060\nAnd then you also have text encrypted,\nwhich is often used for, and\n\n375\n00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:36.360\nI've seen this in the test too, let's\nsay Social Security and let's put 10.\n\n376\n00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.420\nI believe it's more digits than that but\nyou do want to include the dash in there.\n\n377\n00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:44.801\nThen you have, for this specific encrypted\nfield, you've got the length to add, you\n\n378\n00:22:44.801 --> 00:22:49.610\nhave to enter the API name, description\nand text, whether it's required.\n\n379\n00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:52.921\nAnd then because we decided to\ngo with an encrypted field,\n\n380\n00:22:52.921 --> 00:22:56.010\nshould it follow a Social Security number?\n\n381\n00:22:56.010 --> 00:23:00.334\nIf we choose that, this dependent\nPicklist here will ask which one.\n\n382\n00:23:00.334 --> 00:23:04.413\nAnd then credit card information\nis often used for this, so\n\n383\n00:23:04.413 --> 00:23:08.480\ndo you wanna mask all characters,\nthe last four?\n\n384\n00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.630\nCredit card number, so\n\n385\n00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:13.590\nthese are your options here when you're\ncreating an encrypted field in Salesforce.\n\n386\n00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:20.436\nSo I'm gonna select\nSocial Security Number, and Next, and\n\n387\n00:23:20.436 --> 00:23:24.370\nI may have not selected my Mask Character,\nI'm gonna go with X.\n\n388\n00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:27.836\nAnd this will show you an example\nof what it would look like.\n\n389\n00:23:27.836 --> 00:23:35.820\nAnd you're starting to see\nthe prompts after you save a field.\n\n390\n00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.850\nAnd if I select Save &amp; New this time,\nthen we're taken right back to this page\n\n391\n00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.080\nhere to continue to build and\nadd to fields.\n\n392\n00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:48.710\nAnd then, lastly, you have the URL for new\nwebsites that you wanna add to the record.\n\n393\n00:23:53.205 --> 00:23:56.188\nSo we come back into this text record,\n\n394\n00:23:56.188 --> 00:24:00.870\nyou can see here some of\nthe three fields that we added.\n\n395\n00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:03.490\nYou can kinda start seeing\nthe build out here,\n\n396\n00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.990\nand the validation at each\nof those fields can have.\n\n397\n00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.810\n&gt;&gt; And now Felicia earlier you\nhad mention junction objects,\n\n398\n00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:12.186\ncan you tell me a little\nbit more about this?\n\n399\n00:24:12.186 --> 00:24:14.180\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so for a junction object,\n\n400\n00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:18.560\nyou would be creating another object to\nassociate two other objects to each other.\n\n401\n00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.560\nSo it's kinda gonna be your junction and\nconnection between two different objects.\n\n402\n00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.503\nAnd sometimes that's just\nthe creation of one or\n\n403\n00:24:25.503 --> 00:24:29.290\ntwo fields in order to connect\nthose two objects together.\n\n404\n00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:32.070\n&gt;&gt; You got two objects that maybe\naren't directly related, but\n\n405\n00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:34.070\nwe can tie them together\nwith a third object.\n\n406\n00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.320\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, right.\n\n407\n00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.780\n&gt;&gt; Very good, very good.\n\n408\n00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.740\nAll right Felicia,\ntell you about a great look there.\n\n409\n00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:42.355\nReally showed us what we can do with\nthe standard objects that come with\n\n410\n00:24:42.355 --> 00:24:47.330\nSalesforce, the out of box, and we also\nlooked at making those custom objects and\n\n411\n00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:51.850\njust unbelievably customizable\nwhat we can do with those objects.\n\n412\n00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:52.600\nSo, we thank you for\n\n413\n00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.800\nthat look, we hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching this one.\n\n414\n00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.930\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n415\n00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.294\n&gt;&gt; I'm Felicia Duarte.\n\n416\n00:25:00.294 --> 00:25:01.352\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n417\n00:25:01.352 -->

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.319\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:12.174\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.174 --> 00:00:15.958\n&gt;&gt; Hello welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.362\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and\n\n8\n00:00:17.362 --> 00:00:20.120\ntoday we're doing our Salesforce\ncertified administrator.\n\n9\n00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.870\nAnd in this episode we're\ngonna be looking at.\n\n10\n00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.040\nHow we can create and\nuse campaigns within Salesforce.\n\n11\n00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.810\nAnd here to show us the way\nis Miss Felicia Duarte.\n\n12\n00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.070\nWelcome back Felicia.\n\n13\n00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.660\n&gt;&gt; Great, thanks for having me.\n\n14\n00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.985\nSo on today's episode I'm\ngonna go through campaigns.\n\n15\n00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:42.115\nCampaign in the exam goes in hand in hand,\nand it's part of the sales weight.\n\n16\n00:00:42.115 --> 00:00:47.225\nSo it's gonna part of that 9% that we went\nthrough in one of our previous episodes.\n\n17\n00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:51.662\nSo today's goal in this episode is to\ngo through the campaigns, the setup and\n\n18\n00:00:51.662 --> 00:00:56.170\ncreation of a campaign, generating\ntarget list, adding campaign members,\n\n19\n00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.700\nediting campaign members, making changes\nto some of those standard fields.\n\n20\n00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.540\nCampaigns is a standard object.\n\n21\n00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.090\nAnd, then, what's the ROI reporting on it?\n\n22\n00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.210\nWhat's the influence that my campaign\nhas on my overall opportunities.\n\n23\n00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.050\nSo to start let's go through with the who.\n\n24\n00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.590\nSo who has access to campaigns?\n\n25\n00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.330\nWho can set up campaigns?\n\n26\n00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.390\nNow by default with Salesforce, every\nuser has a read only access to campaigns.\n\n27\n00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.480\nIf you want to give an individual more\naccess to edit the campaign records or\n\n28\n00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.180\nadd members to the campaign records or\nimport.\n\n29\n00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.110\nYou want to make sure that in the user\nthey have selected a marketing user.\n\n30\n00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.150\nOnce that's selected and\nsaved they will have more access\n\n31\n00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.560\nto make changes within the marketing\napp within Salesforce.\n\n32\n00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.710\nSo to start let's move and change apps.\n\n33\n00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.420\nAnd work within the campaign\nobject in SalesForce.\n\n34\n00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.830\nSo we're in the sales app,\nlet's move over into marketing.\n\n35\n00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.007\nAnd as we move over\ninto the marketing app,\n\n36\n00:01:57.007 --> 00:01:59.620\nwe're gonna see that\nthe tabs across here change.\n\n37\n00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.680\nWell let's navigate over into\nour campaign's object, here.\n\n38\n00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.170\nSo, before setup you want to create,\nor before adding any members,\n\n39\n00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.310\nyou wanna figure out what's your strategy,\nwhat is your marketing strategy.\n\n40\n00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.440\nNow you can use campaigns to\ngenerate to new leads, or\n\n41\n00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.680\nyou can use this to build your brand.\n\n42\n00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.880\nReach out, have engagement with some of\nyour existing contacts in Salesforce.\n\n43\n00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.250\nSo to start let's look at\none of the out the box\n\n44\n00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.220\nSalesforce campaigns\ngives you as an example.\n\n45\n00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.850\nSo right now we're looking at a recent\ncampaign, DM campaigns to top customers.\n\n46\n00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.340\nJust staying here at our\nhome page you can see,\n\n47\n00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.200\nyou can directly navigate to a campaign\nROI report, to a revenue report,\n\n48\n00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.830\nor to a member analysis report\ndirectly from your home page here.\n\n49\n00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.250\nBut if we move over into this campaign.\n\n50\n00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.170\nSo at this part right here we\nhave the campaign details.\n\n51\n00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.440\nSo some of these fields, or all of these\nfields, are standard fields of Salesforce.\n\n52\n00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.190\nWhat you want to do is you want\nto have enter a campaign name.\n\n53\n00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.880\nYou want to select if it's active.\n\n54\n00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.310\nAnd then some of these fields here\nthat are centered of Selfforce.\n\n55\n00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.270\nYou want to make changes so\n\n56\n00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.030\nthat it applies to the business\nmodel that you're in.\n\n57\n00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.880\nDoes it fit for you that you attend trade\nshows or that you want to keep track for\n\n58\n00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.210\ncampaigns partners or referral programs.\n\n59\n00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.880\nMake changes, add, edit or\n\n60\n00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.410\nrename some of the values here prior\nto setting up your marketing campaigns.\n\n61\n00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.380\nAnd then what's the status?\n\n62\n00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.260\nIs it something that's been\nyou're in the planning stages,\n\n63\n00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.670\nis it in progress,\nsomething that you aborted or completed.\n\n64\n00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.550\nSo you can have previous\nexisting campaigns pushed in.\n\n65\n00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.920\nAnd then if it's an event,\nwhat's the start date and end date?\n\n66\n00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.450\nAnd then what is the expected\nrevenue you're looking to generate\n\n67\n00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.360\nfrom the specific campaign?\n\n68\n00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.090\nIt's important to also have\nthe budgeted cost and the actual cost.\n\n69\n00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.360\nSo with Salesforce,\nan important report is the ROI report.\n\n70\n00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.600\nSo the actual cost is gonna play a role\n\n71\n00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.170\nin generating what that ROI\npercentage actually is.\n\n72\n00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.570\nSo if you have that number, enter it in.\n\n73\n00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.650\nAnd then some of the other fields but\n\n74\n00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.600\nit's not required would be\nwhat's the expected response?\n\n75\n00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.190\nThe percentage of this marketing campaign.\n\n76\n00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.200\nAnd then how many people\nare you sending it to?\n\n77\n00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.690\nSo all of these fields are standard of\nSalesforce but you can also use them to\n\n78\n00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:25.270\ngenerate our create formulas and build off\nmore specific or fine tuned reporting.\n\n79\n00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.490\nAnd can customize that too.\n\n80\n00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.800\nSo and then does this belong\nto a parent's campaign?\n\n81\n00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.620\nSo similar to accounts, parent and\n\n82\n00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.850\nchild records, you can also have\nthe same with your campaigns.\n\n83\n00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.350\nAnd so if that was related,\nyou would use a lookup feature here and\n\n84\n00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.560\nlookup to an existing campaign\nto set that hierarchy.\n\n85\n00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.760\nSo, I'm gonna go back into the homepage\nof our campaign detail, and\n\n86\n00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.210\nI'm gonna go through managing\nthe members of your campaign.\n\n87\n00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.110\nNow, you can manage the members in\nthree different ways within Salesforce.\n\n88\n00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.010\nSo, you can manage your\nmembers individually.\n\n89\n00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:04.330\nYou can go into a lead record or\na contact record, and\n\n90\n00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.660\njust add into an existing campaign.\n\n91\n00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.130\nSo as long as a campaign is active,\nthis is existing,\n\n92\n00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:15.240\nwe can add those members individually and\nthen into list views or reports.\n\n93\n00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.170\nSo let's go into a lead object.\n\n94\n00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.980\nAnd you can create, you want to\nfirst after you've defined what\n\n95\n00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.730\nyour marketing strategy is the next\nquestion is who is my target list.\n\n96\n00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.380\nWho am I trying to target\nwith this campaign?\n\n97\n00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.390\nAnd you set that criteria in your\nreports or in your list views.\n\n98\n00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.930\nSo maybe there's a geographical\nthat you look at.\n\n99\n00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.700\nOr even an age.\n\n100\n00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.200\nAny field, and that can be a custom field\nthat you create within the lead and\n\n101\n00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.360\ncontact.\n\n102\n00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.150\nYou can build off these lists and reports.\n\n103\n00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.770\nJust like you would the same way\nin any lists view within the lead.\n\n104\n00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.510\nOur contact object.\n\n105\n00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.150\nSo if I were to go back\ninto my lead homepage here.\n\n106\n00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.930\nAnd let's use the example of\nall open leads and hit go.\n\n107\n00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.350\nYou can see the button at the very top\nof this list view page, add to campaign.\n\n108\n00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.360\nSo I need to select\na list of all my leads.\n\n109\n00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.090\nAnd if this was already fit with\nthe criteria I wanted to give it.\n\n110\n00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.000\nSo all CEOs in a fortune five\nhundred company that make\n\n111\n00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.490\nhave the annual revenue of\nover $1 billion as an example.\n\n112\n00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.960\nOnly that set of users will show here.\n\n113\n00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.855\nAnd then you can just select all and\nit's just.\n\n114\n00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:30.635\nEasier to add to a campaign.\n\n115\n00:06:30.635 --> 00:06:33.285\nIf I added this review\nusers to the campaign,\n\n116\n00:06:33.285 --> 00:06:37.197\nonce selected I'm gonna use my look up\nfield and search for an existing campaign.\n\n117\n00:06:37.197 --> 00:06:39.565\nSo we're gonna use this one here, and\n\n118\n00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:43.205\nmy member status will apply to\nall the users that are selected.\n\n119\n00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:47.305\nSo sent for this example, and\nand let's select add to campaign.\n\n120\n00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.830\nSo these are new members.\n\n121\n00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.550\nThese members already existed.\n\n122\n00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.160\nI used this group of members\npreviously to add them to the campaign.\n\n123\n00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.740\nBut if they were new, you would see\nthe amount of new members added.\n\n124\n00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.290\nSo I'm gonna select done.\n\n125\n00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.620\nAnd now if we go into the campaign itself.\n\n126\n00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.820\nLet's go into the recent items,\nnavigate there.\n\n127\n00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.840\nIf I scroll to the bottom,\nwe're gonna see a list of those members,\n\n128\n00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.600\nso it was sent with their\ncontact information and\n\n129\n00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.400\nany of the columns I feel is\nrelevant to see at a glance.\n\n130\n00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.520\nNow you can add from this related list,\n\n131\n00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:26.010\nso this is your related list of campaign\nmembers within the campaign object.\n\n132\n00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.430\nYou have your option\nto manage the members,\n\n133\n00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.410\nmake changes to the members via an import\nfile if you want to add new members, or\n\n134\n00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.540\nif you want to do a mass update.\n\n135\n00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.220\nYou can keep track of their responses.\n\n136\n00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.550\nThe responses to the campaign\ncan come in in different ways.\n\n137\n00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:47.640\nSo maybe some of the responses\nare sent through email.\n\n138\n00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.870\nYou can have that either manually managed,\nor you can have the imports come in and\n\n139\n00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.030\nupdate itself within Salesforce.\n\n140\n00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.490\nSo you have these options to update,\n\n141\n00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.560\nedit, and\nadd new members to the campaign itself.\n\n142\n00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.120\nNow a great feature too that\nSalesforce has is campaign influence.\n\n143\n00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.760\nSo if we navigate over to the setup and\ngo into quick find campaign,\n\n144\n00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.070\nwe see the subsection below\nyou have campaign influence.\n\n145\n00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:18.090\nNow if you just change your settings,\nthe first step would be to enable it.\n\n146\n00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.920\nI've gone in here already and\nalready enabled our campaign influence.\n\n147\n00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.810\nAnd then the next steps would\nbe to select that association.\n\n148\n00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:30.950\nSo what criteria do you wanna give it,\nto societe that it has been related and\n\n149\n00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.570\nit's generated these opportunities?\n\n150\n00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.640\nSo within a given time period,\n\n151\n00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.630\nthat my campaign has been active\nyou set that time period.\n\n152\n00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.330\nWe're using the example of 30 days.\n\n153\n00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:46.350\nAny opportunities that were created or\ngenerated from the criteria that we give\n\n154\n00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:51.950\nit will then display in a related list,\ncalled Campaign Influence.\n\n155\n00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:56.460\nAnd that will show you the influence\nthat that campaign has, for\n\n156\n00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.590\nthose given opportunities, and\nyou can generate a report from it, and\n\n157\n00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:06.370\nyou can see how effective\nis this campaign.\n\n158\n00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.230\nSo, it's a common question\nI've see on test.\n\n159\n00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.660\nWhat's the time frame?\n\n160\n00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.000\nCan I leave this blank?\n\n161\n00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.870\nYou certainly can't leave it blank, but\nif you do enter a number 9,999 is the max\n\n162\n00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:22.670\namount of days that you can enter for\na given influence.\n\n163\n00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.132\nSo if I were to hit Save,\n\n164\n00:09:25.132 --> 00:09:29.027\nthen you would see this pop up as\na related list within your opportunities.\n\n165\n00:09:31.081 --> 00:09:33.401\nSo let's navigate back to the campaign.\n\n166\n00:09:35.314 --> 00:09:36.470\nObject.\n\n167\n00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.795\nAnd so, this right now tells us\nthat we have an active campaign,\n\n168\n00:09:39.795 --> 00:09:43.570\nthis is the total number of leads,\nif there were any converted leads.\n\n169\n00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.760\nThe influence in all your\nresponses will show here.\n\n170\n00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:50.280\nWhat's my total contacts,\nif you pulled them from lead and contacts.\n\n171\n00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.130\nAnd then a total number of opportunities\nthat have been generated during this\n\n172\n00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.620\ngiven time period.\n\n173\n00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.510\nAnother great tool that I had mentioned\npreviously would be the reports\n\n174\n00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.960\nthat come from this.\n\n175\n00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.570\nSo if we go down, you can utilize\nthe standard reports, which are great,\n\n176\n00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:07.260\nand you can go back into\nyour homepages there.\n\n177\n00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.271\nOr you can also build off reports and\nbuild off from those influences.\n\n178\n00:10:11.271 --> 00:10:16.580\nWhat are my leads or\ncontacts associated with given campaigns.\n\n179\n00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:21.630\nYou can generate it that way or\nyou can just go directly into your\n\n180\n00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.110\nhomepage here and\nuse a campaign ROI analysis report.\n\n181\n00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:30.680\nNow from here you can see, automatically\nit's gonna look at your campaign names,\n\n182\n00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.410\nit's gonna pull up a list\nof all of them and\n\n183\n00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:35.160\nit's gonna show you the different\ntypes that you have running.\n\n184\n00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.470\nAnd it's gonna show you\nthe actual cost and\n\n185\n00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.750\nthat's going off the field that we\npreviously saw within the campaign record.\n\n186\n00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.280\nAnd then it's gonna pull off.\n\n187\n00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:49.700\nAnd this is a report formula\ncalled a ROI percentage formula.\n\n188\n00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.297\nAnd what that one is gonna give you,\n\n189\n00:10:52.297 --> 00:10:57.060\nit's gonna give you the total value\nall of your opportunities for\n\n190\n00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:02.963\nthat given campaign and it's gonna go\nahead and take that minus the actual cost.\n\n191\n00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:06.987\nSo that's why the actual cost is important\nto have and then it's gonna divide that\n\n192\n00:11:06.987 --> 00:11:10.450\nagain by the actual cost to\ngive you the percentage number.\n\n193\n00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.080\nSo that's something that you do\nwant to keep in mind when you're\n\n194\n00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.150\ngenerating this report.\n\n195\n00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:18.207\nAnd you can use some of those other\nfields to generate your own custom built\n\n196\n00:11:18.207 --> 00:11:18.870\nformulas.\n\n197\n00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:19.490\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic.\n\n198\n00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:24.190\nI mean, incredibly robust system for\nworking with campaigns but then tying\n\n199\n00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:28.170\neverything together and really showing me,\niss this campaign producing anything?\n\n200\n00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.880\nAre we actually making any new contacts,\nor converting any leads,\n\n201\n00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.220\nor making any money?\n\n202\n00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.870\nIs it worth what we're\nspending on this campaign?\n\n203\n00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:36.640\nSo, fantastic.\n\n204\n00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:39.530\nWe appreciate that in-depth\nlook at what we can\n\n205\n00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.410\ndo with campaigns within Salesforce.\n\n206\n00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.560\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n207\n00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.710\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been

You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.322 --> 00:00:15.590\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPRO.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.480\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.740\nAnd today we're doing our\nSalesforce Certified Administrator.\n\n7\n00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.250\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\nlooking at service and support, and\n\n8\n00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.170\nhow we can work with\ncases within Salesforce.\n\n9\n00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.840\nAnd here, to lend us her\nsupport is Miss Felicia Duarte.\n\n10\n00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.930\nWelcome back, Felicia.\n\n11\n00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.170\n&gt;&gt; Great, thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.750\nSo on this episode today,\nI'm gonna cover cases and solution.\n\n13\n00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.540\nThis accounts for 6% of the exam in\n\n14\n00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.384\nthe support section within\nSalesforce certification exam.\n\n15\n00:00:43.384 --> 00:00:45.540\nSo, let's go through and start with cases.\n\n16\n00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.080\nCase management and sales force,\nso let's define that.\n\n17\n00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.664\nWhat is case management and sales force?\n\n18\n00:00:50.664 --> 00:00:54.690\nIt's tracking any of those\ncustomer complaints, issues.\n\n19\n00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.070\nThink of it as a ticketing system.\n\n20\n00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.455\nJust to manage and\nautomate those processes and\n\n21\n00:01:00.455 --> 00:01:03.900\nresponses quicker within Salesforce.\n\n22\n00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.140\nSo, let's navigate over and\nchange the tab that we're in.\n\n23\n00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.440\nRight now, where in the marketing tab for\none of our previous episodes.\n\n24\n00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.970\nBut, let's move over into the call\ncenter and pull in the case object.\n\n25\n00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.380\nNow, not everyone's gonna have access.\n\n26\n00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.430\nMaybe you just have a support team,\nmanaging some of those tickets or\n\n27\n00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.730\nproblems or\nareas that interact with your customers.\n\n28\n00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.850\nSo, maybe only a specific group of users\nneed to have access to this app here, and\n\n29\n00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.480\nthe objects.\n\n30\n00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.770\nSo, now that I switched\nover to our call center,\n\n31\n00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.880\nwe can see two new objects brought\nover to the top of these tabs here.\n\n32\n00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.060\nWe have cases, And we have solutions,\n\n33\n00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.770\nso let's jump into the case object and\ncase homepage.\n\n34\n00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.730\nYou're gonna see a list of\nsome of your recent cases, and\n\n35\n00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.040\nthen you have a few reports and tools to\nwork off directly from your homepage here.\n\n36\n00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.690\nSo, you can jump into the total\ncases created, who it's created by,\n\n37\n00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.020\nwho the agent or the Salesforce user,\nthat's gonna be used interchangeably.\n\n38\n00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.080\nAnd then, what's the history report?\n\n39\n00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.400\nWhat's the time and some standard\nreports or what's the timing and\n\n40\n00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.760\ncompletion to making this case\nresolved from the start date?\n\n41\n00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.220\nAnd then, some tools you can even\nmass email some of your cases or\n\n42\n00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.230\nmass delete cases.\n\n43\n00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.480\nI'll jump into the mass email cases just\nto show you, you're looking at list of all\n\n44\n00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.400\nmy cases right now and if I select to go,\nyou'll see what cases are available and\n\n45\n00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.990\nthis is by default in the developer\norg it's some of the sample cases.\n\n46\n00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.500\nBut you can select all or\nselect one or two, and\n\n47\n00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.470\nyou can have some templates already\npre-bit built out related to some of this\n\n48\n00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.420\ncase management or support management\nto enhance your customers experience.\n\n49\n00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.540\nAnd proof from any of this account didn't\ntake the next step to the sending out\n\n50\n00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.680\nthat email, out that group of users or\ncontacts of yours.\n\n51\n00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.540\nSo, going back to your case,\nlet's go over here.\n\n52\n00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.560\nAnd go into a case record.\n\n53\n00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.980\nNow, you can see the layout of this\nchange for your support users.\n\n54\n00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.920\nTo your left, you have general\ninformation about the contact itself.\n\n55\n00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.830\nSo, we can see the customer name\nif she pertained to a company, and\n\n56\n00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.120\nthe phone number.\n\n57\n00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.640\nThe related list show to your left here.\n\n58\n00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.500\nSo, we'll touch base in a bit solutions,\nbut\n\n59\n00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.370\nif there were case teams related\nto this case, or emails and\n\n60\n00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.260\nrelated cases, all of that will\npopulate to your left now.\n\n61\n00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.570\nAnd the details show in\nthis details column here.\n\n62\n00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.456\nBy default, I had worked on this record\nalready and navigated to details, but\n\n63\n00:03:34.456 --> 00:03:36.563\nby default you're taken to the feed here.\n\n64\n00:03:36.563 --> 00:03:38.195\nAnd this is related to your chatter feed.\n\n65\n00:03:38.195 --> 00:03:41.280\nSo, if there was anything\nrelated you would see it here.\n\n66\n00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.710\nBut, to pull in the details you wanna make\nsure you grab into the details section.\n\n67\n00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.855\nAnd you can see some of the standard\nfields that sales force gives you.\n\n68\n00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:53.935\nSo, do not create any custom fields,\nthis is what you have to work off.\n\n69\n00:03:53.935 --> 00:03:57.665\nThere are a few ways that\nthese cases can be generated.\n\n70\n00:03:57.665 --> 00:04:00.867\nSo, the cases can be\ngenerated via an email.\n\n71\n00:04:00.867 --> 00:04:04.185\nSo, Salesforce has what's\ncalled the email to case and\n\n72\n00:04:04.185 --> 00:04:09.720\nyou can set up your support email,\nthat you have for a company.\n\n73\n00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.670\nAnd any email sent to that email address\nor support email address that you\n\n74\n00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.040\ndefine in the setup, will then generate\ncases automatically into Salesforce.\n\n75\n00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.050\nSo, if we look back here at our detail\npage, you can see the subject, and\n\n76\n00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.370\nthat's gonna pull it from the email.\n\n77\n00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.514\nAnd in the body of that will\nlive within description.\n\n78\n00:04:28.514 --> 00:04:32.770\nSo, sometimes you may have cases\nwith very little information.\n\n79\n00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.350\nSalesforce is gonna look\nto the email address first,\n\n80\n00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.170\nto associate it to maybe\nany given contact.\n\n81\n00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.170\nSo, if the record exist it's\ngonna create a case for\n\n82\n00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.100\nthe existing contact in Salesforce.\n\n83\n00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.870\nAnd if it does not find a matching email,\n\n84\n00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.300\nyou're gonna create a new contact and\na new case.\n\n85\n00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.000\nNow, you're gonna have very\nlittle information at this point.\n\n86\n00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.002\nSo, you can enter new fields if\nits related to a certain service\n\n87\n00:04:58.002 --> 00:04:59.427\nthat you provide or product.\n\n88\n00:04:59.427 --> 00:05:04.973\nWhen you're trying to troubleshoot\nwhat common areas of issues you have,\n\n89\n00:05:04.973 --> 00:05:06.920\nor how will you handle it?\n\n90\n00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.526\nSo, right now,\nwe're just working off of the case reason.\n\n91\n00:05:09.526 --> 00:05:14.740\nSo, cases aren't always bad things,\nyou can also have positive feedback.\n\n92\n00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.830\nMaybe you wanna keep track in future\nreports what some of my feedback and\n\n93\n00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.194\nnegative feedback, or\n\n94\n00:05:20.194 --> 00:05:24.160\nwhat are some common issues that\nyour org is experiencing as a whole.\n\n95\n00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.779\nSo, this way you can kinda breakdown and\n\n96\n00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:30.890\nfigure out ways how to improve\nyour customer success.\n\n97\n00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.063\nSo, if I double click into here some of\nthese may apply to your business model and\n\n98\n00:05:35.063 --> 00:05:35.820\nsome may not.\n\n99\n00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.612\nSo, I would go in previews and\nmake those changes as a system admin, and\n\n100\n00:05:39.612 --> 00:05:43.780\nmake sure that everything is fine\ntuned to fit your business needs.\n\n101\n00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.210\nSo, do you provide a service that needs\ninstallation is there a breakdown\n\n102\n00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.434\nequipment design.\n\n103\n00:05:49.434 --> 00:05:56.200\nAnything you pretty granular here, you can\nstart associating with the product itself.\n\n104\n00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.850\nAnd this is all directly related\nto just the case details.\n\n105\n00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.690\nOther series of questions\nthat you ask your caller or\n\n106\n00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.310\ncontact that you wanna keep and store\nhere, then create some custom fields.\n\n107\n00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.130\nBut right now,\npretty you just have priority.\n\n108\n00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.090\nSo, the priority's gonna be low,\nmedium, or high.\n\n109\n00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.470\nAnd then,\na standard field is what is the status?\n\n110\n00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.214\nSo, is this case a new case?\n\n111\n00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:22.528\nAre you still working on it?\n\n112\n00:06:22.528 --> 00:06:25.930\nDoes it need to be\nescalated at this point?\n\n113\n00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.990\nWhich we'll get into as far\nas case escalation rules.\n\n114\n00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.830\nAnd then,\naside from the case reason on the type.\n\n115\n00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.205\nSo, if your business is broken\nup into different areas, or\n\n116\n00:06:36.205 --> 00:06:41.064\nmaybe you just have one service, but you\ncould have different scenarios that you're\n\n117\n00:06:41.064 --> 00:06:44.993\ntrying to keep track of,\nutilize the type field within Salesforce.\n\n118\n00:06:44.993 --> 00:06:49.334\nSo as a system admin, it's important to be\nacquainted with these standard fields, so\n\n119\n00:06:49.334 --> 00:06:51.420\nyou know where to make the right changes.\n\n120\n00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.570\nAnd you're not duplicating fields here.\n\n121\n00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.128\nAnd then, if there was product related,\n\n122\n00:06:56.128 --> 00:06:57.872\nyou wanna have product\npotential liability.\n\n123\n00:06:57.872 --> 00:07:03.060\nIf some of these don't pertain,\ndelete and remove these off the field.\n\n124\n00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.210\nBut, you do have to have a created by,\nlast modified by.\n\n125\n00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.110\nAnd if you do need any custom links,\nyou can add them here.\n\n126\n00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.862\nSo at this page, we can see right\nnow that this is a new case.\n\n127\n00:07:12.862 --> 00:07:16.660\nThe priority is low and\nthis is my contact.\n\n128\n00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:22.540\nNow, you wanna enable your support agents,\nor your Salesforce users.\n\n129\n00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:26.590\nTo be able to quickly answer and\nresolve these cases and\n\n130\n00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.610\nyou can set up what's called\nknowledge within Salesforce, and\n\n131\n00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:35.700\nhave these pre-built out solutions\nto help then determine, and\n\n132\n00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.900\nprovide recommendations\nto resolving this case.\n\n133\n00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.700\nSo, I pulled over, we have solutions that\nare built in, related to just this case.\n\n134\n00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:49.720\nSo, in this example, this is an issue\nregarding to maintenance guidelines.\n\n135\n00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.455\nSo, I can go and view suggestions,\nsolutions or I can find solutions.\n\n136\n00:07:54.455 --> 00:07:59.856\nSo, it's gonna look at some certain key\nwords, it kinda recommends some for you,\n\n137\n00:07:59.856 --> 00:08:04.871\nbut if it doesn't find any match,\nyou wanna search within your solutions for\n\n138\n00:08:04.871 --> 00:08:08.135\na potential matches to provide for\nthe customer.\n\n139\n00:08:08.135 --> 00:08:09.520\nNow, I'm wanna take it one step back.\n\n140\n00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.830\nSo, I'm going to find solution for\nyour cases, but\n\n141\n00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:16.350\nbefore doing that you wanna make sure\nyou have solutions pre-built out.\n\n142\n00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.900\nSo, if you go over into\nthe solutions object,\n\n143\n00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:25.740\nthis is where you would create a list just\nlike any record of different solutions.\n\n144\n00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:30.050\nAnd you can tag your solutions,\nso this way they're easy to find,\n\n145\n00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:32.060\nand they're searchable.\n\n146\n00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.220\nSo, right now, let's go into\nlist of all reviewed solutions,\n\n147\n00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.400\nso you can see what this can look like.\n\n148\n00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.260\nUsing this industry that\nwe're in as an example,\n\n149\n00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.730\nwe see that we have GenWatt\ninstallation services.\n\n150\n00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:48.780\nSo, this is a status, this is a solution\ntitle that's gonna look to, and\n\n151\n00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.370\nthis is a solution details here,\nthat you could offer to your customer.\n\n152\n00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.970\nSo, you just pre, and very standard\nfield is either easy to make.\n\n153\n00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.000\nI would provide a new solution and\nthis is something for\n\n154\n00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.650\nyour sales reps again to see and\nhave access to.\n\n155\n00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.160\nMaybe they're searching,\n\n156\n00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:11.120\ninstead of searching around trying to find\nthe answer you have these pre-built out.\n\n157\n00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.792\nAnd then, you can even add them\nto your cases like we saw.\n\n158\n00:09:15.792 --> 00:09:18.900\nSo, as you're searching for\na solution, let's add one here.\n\n159\n00:09:23.115 --> 00:09:24.700\nSo, I'm gonna enter a keyword.\n\n160\n00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:29.680\nAnd this is why you wanna be clear\nas you're creating these solutions,\n\n161\n00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.242\nlet's enter service.\n\n162\n00:09:31.242 --> 00:09:37.120\nThis way you know how to quickly\nfind the right solutions.\n\n163\n00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.360\nAnd this is for the end user.\n\n164\n00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.230\nAnd so it gives us a few options,\n\n165\n00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:46.290\nit tells us this is by typing in\nservice what maybe a possible solution.\n\n166\n00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.960\nLet just go with the first one here,\nit's related to service.\n\n167\n00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.030\nAnd now you're gonna see the tie of\nthe solution to the case detail.\n\n168\n00:09:55.730 --> 00:10:01.330\nNow, you can also straight directly\nfrom Salesforce, you can send emails,\n\n169\n00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.110\nnow within sales you have activities,\nyou can generate emails there.\n\n170\n00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.604\nBut the difference with cases\nis they store the email and\n\n171\n00:10:08.604 --> 00:10:10.694\nthat interaction with with you.\n\n172\n00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:16.020\nEspecially with the email to case and\nthe responses in a separate related list.\n\n173\n00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.910\nAnd in the same list you can also\nsend an email directly to the client.\n\n174\n00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:26.070\nAnd it will generate here and you can\npull in templates and add in files.\n\n175\n00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:31.650\nSo this way, you're keeping track of\nthat engagement towards closing this\n\n176\n00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.630\ncase, all within one record in Salesforce.\n\n177\n00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:39.720\nNow also, with cases, just like\nyou could with account teams, and\n\n178\n00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.680\nteam selling, you can have case teams.\n\n179\n00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.120\nSo, maybe there's multiple people that\nare involved in handling this case.\n\n180\n00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.940\nSo, Update Case Team Members, and\n\n181\n00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:55.378\nprior to that you wanna drag this as\na related list into this object here.\n\n182\n00:10:55.378 --> 00:10:59.366\nSo, you're gonna look to\na list of all your users, and\n\n183\n00:10:59.366 --> 00:11:02.420\nyou have the access to even add contacts.\n\n184\n00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.061\nThat's one of the differences\nbetween the case management and\n\n185\n00:11:06.061 --> 00:11:09.400\nthe case team members as\noppose to the account team.\n\n186\n00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.070\nBecause you can add contacts to this and\nwhat is their role.\n\n187\n00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:17.610\nRight now, we have not selected any\nlet me go into user and select myself.\n\n188\n00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.190\nWe don't have any roles set up, so\n\n189\n00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:24.240\nyou wanna set up what those roles\ncould be, and what their access is.\n\n190\n00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:28.420\nAnd then,\nif you had any pre built out case teams,\n\n191\n00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:33.210\nthen you can also have those groups built\nout and search for those members here, and\n\n192\n00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:37.188\nadd groups of people one at a time\nas opposed to individually.\n\n193\n00:11:37.188 --> 00:11:41.360\nSo, I'm gonna take a step back, and\n\n194\n00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.060\nshow you that sales force\nalso has a related case.\n\n195\n00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.150\nSo, this will show you and\n\n196\n00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:49.000\nit's a related view, cases are related\npertaining to this client.\n\n197\n00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.876\nSo, you know how to quickly access,\nand how you fixed a previous case,\n\n198\n00:11:52.876 --> 00:11:54.891\nhow you might be able to fix this one.\n\n199\n00:11:54.891 --> 00:11:59.849\nSo, this is all about helping the end\nuser, being able to quickly resolve cases\n\n200\n00:11:59.849 --> 00:12:04.440\nbecause that's a common report\ntype needed in support centers.\n\n201\n00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:09.480\nSo, the time to complete cases is\ncrucial and being able to give them\n\n202\n00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:16.420\nall the information they need to do so\nthemselves is what case management is for.\n\n203\n00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:18.590\nAnd to really automate the process too.\n\n204\n00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:22.920\nSo, you have if we go into setup,\nCase Assignment Rules and\n\n205\n00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.800\nCase Escalation Rules.\n\n206\n00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.396\nSo, I'm gonna type into\ncases in my quick find here.\n\n207\n00:12:27.396 --> 00:12:32.144\nAnd we're gonna have Case Assignment Rules\nlocated as a section,\n\n208\n00:12:32.144 --> 00:12:36.891\nand within here, I can determine\nbased off any field in Salesforce\n\n209\n00:12:36.891 --> 00:12:42.760\nthe criteria you give it, who should\nbe the default owner of this case.\n\n210\n00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.730\nSo, right here we have\nstandard as an example.\n\n211\n00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:50.770\nAnd right here, what we're telling this in\nthis role entry here, is anything that,\n\n212\n00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:55.920\nwhere the SLA equals that this is a gold\nor platinum customer, and the account\n\n213\n00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.775\ntype equals a customer, assign this to\nmyself, right now, being the only user.\n\n214\n00:13:00.775 --> 00:13:04.640\nAnd in an org,\nwhere you have multiple support agents\n\n215\n00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.140\nthat may be handling certain\nterritories or certain products or\n\n216\n00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:12.728\nmaybe a platinum customer,\nyou can start assigning it right here.\n\n217\n00:13:12.728 --> 00:13:15.010\nSo, you wanna make sure\nthat the fields exist, so\n\n218\n00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:17.790\nthat you can be able to\nbuild this criteria.\n\n219\n00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:21.214\nAt this point,\nyou can establish how this get's assigned.\n\n220\n00:13:21.214 --> 00:13:25.882\nSo, once you've assigned it,\nyou've created this automated process,\n\n221\n00:13:25.882 --> 00:13:29.954\nthe second piece to go back, so\nthis will probably be in an email,\n\n222\n00:13:29.954 --> 00:13:33.460\nit can be automated, and\nassigned automatically.\n\n223\n00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:36.100\nBut it can also come in\nthrough your webpage.\n\n224\n00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.221\nSo, similar to what we discussed\nin another episode web to lead,\n\n225\n00:13:39.221 --> 00:13:40.826\nyou can also create a web to case.\n\n226\n00:13:40.826 --> 00:13:43.710\nSo, I'm gonna go back into my quick find.\n\n227\n00:13:46.431 --> 00:13:49.938\nAnd show you that you can also\nhave the web to case over here.\n\n228\n00:13:49.938 --> 00:13:57.350\nAnd go through I also wanna\nshow you the email to case.\n\n229\n00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:01.679\nThe same way that you can create the web\nto lead, you can create the web to case.\n\n230\n00:14:01.679 --> 00:14:03.325\nAnd you just, real simple,\n\n231\n00:14:03.325 --> 00:14:07.234\nenter the leads that you want from\nthe left to right to select it, and\n\n232\n00:14:07.234 --> 00:14:11.640\nit will generate the HTML code for\nyour webmaster to place onto the website.\n\n233\n00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.880\nAnd the neat feature about that\nis it will generate those cases\n\n234\n00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.810\nautomatically for you, and\nthen with the assignment rules you set up,\n\n235\n00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:23.710\nyour users will automatically\nbe notified of these cases.\n\n236\n00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:29.860\nAnd then, the next piece would be the\nCase Escalation Rules right under here.\n\n237\n00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.670\nSo, this is an example of\na Case Escalation Rule\n\n238\n00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.430\nwhere if it starts moving up,\nthe priority equals high.\n\n239\n00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.950\nMaybe needs to go to somebody higher up.\n\n240\n00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:43.910\nThe response time isn't soon enough.\n\n241\n00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.340\nYou have certain criteria you can set\nup similar to your assignment rules of\n\n242\n00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:50.480\nwhat happens next?\n\n243\n00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.816\nWho does this get escalated to,\nand what's the criteria set?\n\n244\n00:14:55.816 --> 00:14:58.346\nSo, in this one, the priority equals high,\n\n245\n00:14:58.346 --> 00:15:01.216\nstart moving this up in\nthe escalation rules here.\n\n246\n00:15:01.216 --> 00:15:05.312\nAnd you can see how this can be move\nof an automated process without\n\n247\n00:15:05.312 --> 00:15:09.100\nhaving to talk to individuals,\nand get the approvals.\n\n248\n00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.560\nIt's all sort of done\nautomatically in Salesforce.\n\n249\n00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.010\nSo, I'm gonna go back\ninto our case homepage.\n\n250\n00:15:19.163 --> 00:15:22.310\nAnd we covered the creation of a case.\n\n251\n00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:25.360\nWe covered some of the options\nto resolving the case.\n\n252\n00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.509\nBut where can you generate some of\nthese reports that Salesforce gives you\n\n253\n00:15:28.509 --> 00:15:29.079\nout the box?\n\n254\n00:15:29.079 --> 00:15:31.450\nYou can do so from the homepage.\n\n255\n00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:35.410\nBut if you go in to do\nreports object itself,\n\n256\n00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:41.320\nSalesforce will give you a list of\nfolders with reports living inside.\n\n257\n00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:46.110\nSo, you wanna look for\nthe support report folder,\n\n258\n00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:51.070\nand you can see this is\nwhat Salesforce considers\n\n259\n00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.520\nsome reports that you might need.\n\n260\n00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.780\nSo, is it a history report?\n\n261\n00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:59.420\nLet me see the relationship between my\nsolutions object with my cases object.\n\n262\n00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:04.142\nI wanna see the relationship is that\nthe context rows within my cases, and\n\n263\n00:16:04.142 --> 00:16:09.166\nsince we went over to the events of the\ncases, and the solutions, and how those\n\n264\n00:16:09.166 --> 00:16:13.919\ntwo work together, this is an example\nof how a cases with solution apart.\n\n265\n00:16:13.919 --> 00:16:19.090\nSo, showing you the type and\nthe cases that you have going for a given\n\n266\n00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:25.131\nperiod of time, and if it's breaking\ndown the solution of created together.\n\n267\n00:16:25.131 --> 00:16:29.670\n&gt;&gt; All right Felicia, great look and\ndemonstration of what we can do with cases\n\n268\n00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:33.940\nwithin Salesforce, how we can\nprovide that service and support.\n\n269\n00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:34.950\nSo, we appreciate that.\n\n270\n00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:37.300\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n271\n00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.470\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n272\n00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:41.430\n&gt;&gt; I'm Felicia Duarte.\n\n273\n00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:46.765\n&gt;&gt; And we'll

00:00:08.242\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:12.343\nYou're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.343 --> 00:00:15.090\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.760\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\n\n7\n00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.210\ntoday we're doing our\nSalesforce Certified Administrator.\n\n8\n00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.470\nAnd in this episode we're going to be\nlooking at activities and chatter.\n\n9\n00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.940\nAnd here to chat with us about\nchatter is Ms. Felicia Duarte.\n\n10\n00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.960\nWelcome back, Felicia.\n\n11\n00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.830\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.770\nSo on this episode today, I'm going\nto talk to activities and chatter.\n\n13\n00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.900\nNow we've covered,\n\n14\n00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.080\nin our other episodes, most of the larger\npieces that are part of the exam.\n\n15\n00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.534\nActivities account for\n3% of the test questions and\n\n16\n00:00:43.534 --> 00:00:45.870\nchatter accounts for a small 1%.\n\n17\n00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.355\nBut again they all add up, so\nit's good to know everything and\n\n18\n00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:52.360\nit's good to know the areas you might not\nknow so much, where you're weaker in, so\n\n19\n00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.700\nat least you get those questions right.\n\n20\n00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.130\nEvery question and\nright answer counts on this exam.\n\n21\n00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.950\nSo let's start with activities.\n\n22\n00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.410\nWhat is an activity?\n\n23\n00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.030\nAn activity holds two things.\n\n24\n00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.100\nYou can have your events.\n\n25\n00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.110\nAnd then you can have your task.\n\n26\n00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.360\nNow the difference\nbetween the two is events\n\n27\n00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.580\nwill always have a start time and\nan end time.\n\n28\n00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.940\nThink of your events as conferences,\n\n29\n00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.880\nmeetings, anything with a start date and\nend date.\n\n30\n00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.600\nAnd then your task, which we'll get in to,\ncan be anything from logging a call\n\n31\n00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.195\nto maybe a follow-up\ntask that you need to do.\n\n32\n00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:30.450\nFollow-up with an email,\nmake a phone call.\n\n33\n00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.570\nSo what we'll go through some of those.\n\n34\n00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.600\nSo let's navigate through\nwithin Salesforce and\n\n35\n00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.530\nget over into the activities\nfrom your home page.\n\n36\n00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.590\nSo right now we're\nlooking at the home page.\n\n37\n00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.300\nYou can see a list of your calendar\nwhich will hold your events,\n\n38\n00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.020\nyour tasks, and items to approve.\n\n39\n00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.810\nSo let's start with meetings.\n\n40\n00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.470\nSo aside from the activities of tasks and\nevents,\n\n41\n00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.910\nyou can schedule meetings and\nrequest meetings.\n\n42\n00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.792\nNow meetings can be sent out,\n\n43\n00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:04.086\nmeeting requests within Salesforce\ncan be sent out to your leads and\n\n44\n00:02:04.086 --> 00:02:08.251\ncontacts within Salesforce,\nas well as your Salesforce users.\n\n45\n00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:14.643\nSo if we hit, from your home page,\nnew meeting request and select here.\n\n46\n00:02:16.098 --> 00:02:19.640\nThis is a pretty neat feature\nthat Salesforce has out the box.\n\n47\n00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.179\nYou can add invitees and\nyou can select from here, search for\n\n48\n00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:27.120\nexisting users, leads and contacts.\n\n49\n00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.278\nAs long as they already\nexist within Salesforce.\n\n50\n00:02:30.278 --> 00:02:31.790\nSo once you select the users,\n\n51\n00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.302\nyou can enter a subject line because\nyou'll be sending it via an email.\n\n52\n00:02:36.302 --> 00:02:40.490\nA where, if you have a place,\nyou can leave it as TBD.\n\n53\n00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.280\nAnd then, propose meeting time.\n\n54\n00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.460\nSo I like this feature of Salesforce.\n\n55\n00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.200\nYou can let Salesforce look within your\ncalendar to suggest meeting times or\n\n56\n00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.390\nyou can pick five times slots.\n\n57\n00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.277\nSo let's just select a few.\n\n58\n00:02:55.437 --> 00:03:01.010\nOn these dates here and if I selected too\nmany, I'm gonna hit okay, the max is five.\n\n59\n00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.890\nAnd then set the duration.\n\n60\n00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.200\nSo is it for one hour, two hours, you\ncan go all the way up to eight hours and\n\n61\n00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.940\nit will block out on that time frame for\nyou within your Salesforce calendar.\n\n62\n00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.940\nAnd we're gonna suggest these times and\nhit next.\n\n63\n00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.290\nI'm gonna select See\na sample meeting request so\n\n64\n00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.720\nyou can see what that would look like.\n\n65\n00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.689\nLater on, I'll talk to adding and\nmaking this enable to add your logo here.\n\n66\n00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.645\nBut once you do,\nyou can see the five time slots or\n\n67\n00:03:28.645 --> 00:03:30.967\nin this case six time slots selected.\n\n68\n00:03:30.967 --> 00:03:32.781\nAnd this is what the email\nwould look like.\n\n69\n00:03:32.781 --> 00:03:35.647\nThey'd get an email with\nthe meeting request.\n\n70\n00:03:35.647 --> 00:03:37.063\nFrom who.\n\n71\n00:03:37.063 --> 00:03:39.351\nWhat the subject is that you selected.\n\n72\n00:03:39.351 --> 00:03:43.038\nThe who, the when,\nthe duration, and where.\n\n73\n00:03:43.038 --> 00:03:45.291\nAnd then, your user or your lead or\n\n74\n00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:51.095\nyour contact has the option of selecting\nthe time frame that works best with them.\n\n75\n00:03:51.095 --> 00:03:53.985\nAnd then that will block out to\nyour calendar within Salesforce.\n\n76\n00:03:53.985 --> 00:03:57.115\nIt's a really neat feature,\nmake sure you know it.\n\n77\n00:03:57.115 --> 00:03:58.975\nTest it, try it out yourself.\n\n78\n00:03:59.975 --> 00:04:03.285\nAgain, I suggest always testing\nthings out all the way through so\n\n79\n00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:05.425\nyou fully understand the concept.\n\n80\n00:04:05.425 --> 00:04:08.950\nSo when you see a question,\nyou know how to answer it on the exam.\n\n81\n00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.210\nAnd then once I select Next,\nwe went through this, sorry,\n\n82\n00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.010\nwe went through this piece of\nthe adding of the to and the from.\n\n83\n00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.270\nThis is just gonna show you\nwhat that would look like.\n\n84\n00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:18.950\nSo you got the subject and the where.\n\n85\n00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.910\nAnd then if you need to make any\nprevious changes, you can go ahead and\n\n86\n00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.250\ndo so or add an additional message.\n\n87\n00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.150\nBut once that's all said and\ndone, this is showing up.\n\n88\n00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.520\nThese are required fields,\nbecause I didn't select any invitee or\n\n89\n00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.080\nsubject at that time.\n\n90\n00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.470\nAnd then send it out.\n\n91\n00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.570\nSo it's a really neat\nfeature that you have.\n\n92\n00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.770\nFrom your home page,\nlet's take a look into your calendar.\n\n93\n00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.980\nSo right now we're looking at calendar,\nwe're looking at a single user view.\n\n94\n00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.470\nIf I select this,\nyou can have a multi-user view.\n\n95\n00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.266\nAnd you can see everyone within\nthe Salesforce org That you have access to\n\n96\n00:04:52.266 --> 00:04:53.922\nseeing their calendar.\n\n97\n00:04:53.922 --> 00:04:56.188\nSo you can see that right now,\nI'm looking at a one day view.\n\n98\n00:04:56.188 --> 00:05:00.715\nSo hour by hour, but also have the option\nof seeing it as a weekly view, or\n\n99\n00:05:00.715 --> 00:05:02.140\nas a monthly view.\n\n100\n00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.006\nYou can see how this changes here.\n\n101\n00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:06.565\nThere's a few different view\nsettings that you can see so\n\n102\n00:05:06.565 --> 00:05:08.278\nif you want to see it by week and month.\n\n103\n00:05:08.278 --> 00:05:12.970\nBut you can also see it within\nthese values that you choose.\n\n104\n00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.510\nIf you're working with an org or\nsetting up an org,\n\n105\n00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.250\nyou have over a 100 employees, I'm sure\nyou don't associate with all of them.\n\n106\n00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.630\nI would break it up into different\nviews that matters to you.\n\n107\n00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.000\nAnd you can see the views differently.\n\n108\n00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.610\nFrom here it's more of a task item view.\n\n109\n00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.710\nAnd this will show all your tasks and\nevents associated with these users here.\n\n110\n00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.930\nNot just calendar view, but\nbroken down that can be list view here.\n\n111\n00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.450\nSo, a pretty neat feature.\n\n112\n00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.450\nAnd then always notice here in the list\nview you have that option enabled to\n\n113\n00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.940\nprint everything out,\nand this printable view.\n\n114\n00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.010\nThere's this question\nI've seen on Salesforce,\n\n115\n00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.200\ncan you print out Activity List Views?\n\n116\n00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.260\nCan you print out events?\n\n117\n00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.510\nAnd the answer is yes.\n\n118\n00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.060\nAnd you can do that from this page here.\n\n119\n00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.030\nWe're not exporting out.\n\n120\n00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.480\nSometimes the question is real specific.\n\n121\n00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.470\nWe're just printing it out\nfrom this list view page here.\n\n122\n00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.559\nSo, I'm gonna navigate back to my home.\n\n123\n00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:10.610\nAnd we're looking right now.\n\n124\n00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:11.750\nAgain, we're in a developer org.\n\n125\n00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.610\nBut if I were to come into my home page,\nand\n\n126\n00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:20.020\nI had tasks assigned to me, I can see from\nthis page here a list of all my tasks.\n\n127\n00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.980\nRight now, all open.\n\n128\n00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.882\nThere's no any, there's not any\nopened tasks assigned to me.\n\n129\n00:06:24.882 --> 00:06:28.560\nBut Salesforce gives you these\noptions here, so you can see.\n\n130\n00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.720\nAnd let me zoom in.\n\n131\n00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.648\nThis is smaller, but\nyou can see Open, Overdue.\n\n132\n00:06:36.647 --> 00:06:40.880\nToday, Today and Overdue, Tomorrow,\nNext 7 days, these are your filters here.\n\n133\n00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.430\nWe can't make changes to\nthat on the home page but\n\n134\n00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.220\nthis is what Salesforce gives you.\n\n135\n00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.980\nNow if the task were overdue.\n\n136\n00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.430\nSee if we have any here.\n\n137\n00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.620\nI'm just gonna select.\n\n138\n00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.630\nI don't think we have any.\n\n139\n00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.970\nBut those will be highlighted with red,\nand so\n\n140\n00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.080\nyou're able to distinguish,\nlook these are the tasks that are overdue,\n\n141\n00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.420\nthey're gonna be at the top,\nyou need to complete these.\n\n142\n00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.577\nAnd from here,\nwe're gonna create some tasks.\n\n143\n00:07:05.577 --> 00:07:08.135\nAnd this way you can see what that\nwould look like in your home page.\n\n144\n00:07:08.135 --> 00:07:12.510\nAnd you can the different places to\ncomplete those tasks from within\n\n145\n00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.437\nSalesforce.\n\n146\n00:07:13.437 --> 00:07:17.844\nSo within every standard and\ncustom object in Salesforce,\n\n147\n00:07:17.844 --> 00:07:20.758\nyou can add the activity related list.\n\n148\n00:07:20.758 --> 00:07:24.085\nNow let's go in to\nan existing account record.\n\n149\n00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.710\nThis seems to be the popular\nrecord of these episodes.\n\n150\n00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.320\nSo, I'm gonna scroll all\nthe way to the bottom.\n\n151\n00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.780\nAnd this applies to every\nobject in Salesforce.\n\n152\n00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.420\nIf you want your users being system\nadmin to have access to see it.\n\n153\n00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.393\nAgain, you can limit their access\nto the buttons that are available.\n\n154\n00:07:42.393 --> 00:07:46.612\nSo, maybe you just want them\nto see open activities and\n\n155\n00:07:46.612 --> 00:07:52.128\nnot necessarily create, you have\nthe option to configure it that way.\n\n156\n00:07:52.128 --> 00:07:54.903\nBut if we wanted to For this account.\n\n157\n00:07:54.903 --> 00:07:59.519\nMaybe it's been a while since\nthe last contact date, so\n\n158\n00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:03.440\nmaybe want to set up a follow-up contact.\n\n159\n00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.520\nLet's use the example as I made\na phone call out to this account.\n\n160\n00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.623\nSo open activities will show any\nactivities that need to be completed,\n\n161\n00:08:12.623 --> 00:08:16.460\nthey have yet to be completed,\nthey're still open.\n\n162\n00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.600\nActivity History will show\nyou any activities that have\n\n163\n00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.290\nalready been completed.\n\n164\n00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:26.420\nSo in the case of logging a call, and I'm\ngonna scroll up to the edit layouts and\n\n165\n00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.070\nmake sure that I have all my buttons\napplied so we're not missing anything.\n\n166\n00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:34.090\nSo I'm gonna scroll down,\nI'm in page setup.\n\n167\n00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.263\nAnd I'm gonna go to my activity history.\n\n168\n00:08:37.263 --> 00:08:41.527\nAnd I'm hitting the wrench and\nthen when I scroll down to buttons, and\n\n169\n00:08:41.527 --> 00:08:44.540\nI'm missing my Log a Call and Mail Merge.\n\n170\n00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.170\nBy default,\nthat's on then the previous episode\n\n171\n00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.190\nI wanted to show you how to remove it but\nnow we wanna bring it back.\n\n172\n00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:54.050\nSo I'm just gonna hit Save and you can\nsee how quick, that takes in two minutes.\n\n173\n00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:58.910\nSo, once this is saving, we're gonna\nbe taken back to the account record.\n\n174\n00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.640\nAnd let's work with Open Activities and\nActivity History.\n\n175\n00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.930\nNow if I wanna log a call or\nhave the sales users log calls,\n\n176\n00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:12.230\na common question as a system admin\nthat we see is, I wanna keep track of\n\n177\n00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:17.430\nmeetings that my end users go to,\nI wanna keep track of on site meetings,\n\n178\n00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:22.210\nI wanna keep track of how many calls\nthey're making, maybe call centers.\n\n179\n00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.210\nIf you have a call center\napp that sets up to this,\n\n180\n00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:29.040\nthere's always gonna be times your\nactivity history open activities.\n\n181\n00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.930\nA call made is something\nthat's been completed.\n\n182\n00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.787\nSo you need to log a call.\n\n183\n00:09:33.787 --> 00:09:36.813\nI'm gonna say I logged\na call to this account.\n\n184\n00:09:36.813 --> 00:09:41.430\nSo, as I select log a call it's already\nnet identified the subject as call.\n\n185\n00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:46.038\nYou can see here if I select these and\nthese are all, you are able to change and\n\n186\n00:09:46.038 --> 00:09:50.895\nedit these, so whether it was an email,\na letter that was sent or a quote.\n\n187\n00:09:50.895 --> 00:09:55.637\nOr other, these actions here\nare able be completed and renamed.\n\n188\n00:09:55.637 --> 00:09:58.595\nSo, right now I logged a call.\n\n189\n00:09:58.595 --> 00:10:03.040\nIf it was to a specific contact\nwithin the account that we're in.\n\n190\n00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.610\nI can look up and see if we have\nany contacts associated to this.\n\n191\n00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:12.410\nAnd it's just gonna look right now\nto all contacts within Salesforce.\n\n192\n00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.470\nAs an admin you can configure\nthis a little bit more deeply and\n\n193\n00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.690\ncreate some criteria based filters.\n\n194\n00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:23.410\nOn this look up field you search for\njust contacts living on the account but\n\n195\n00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:26.220\nthat takes further set\nup in customization.\n\n196\n00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.360\nSo, right now we're just gonna\nutilize Betty as the example and\n\n197\n00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.420\nwhat is this related to?\n\n198\n00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:37.220\nWe created this within the accounts\nthat's gonna select off the account and\n\n199\n00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.495\nthe account names.\n\n200\n00:10:38.495 --> 00:10:40.860\nSo, I don't need to make any changes here.\n\n201\n00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.000\nAnd then if there were any case comment.\n\n202\n00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.010\nSo in this example I'm gonna say\ncall logged sent to voicemail.\n\n203\n00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.895\nSo being the great sales rep\nthat I am in this example.\n\n204\n00:10:54.895 --> 00:10:56.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I need to follow up because I\n\n205\n00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.100\nlogged a call.\n\n206\n00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.870\nLeft a voicemail, no one answered.\n\n207\n00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:06.290\nSo at that same page of an activity\nhistory for logging a call, you can also\n\n208\n00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:11.850\nset a reoccurring, or\nset up of a second open activity.\n\n209\n00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.050\nSo my next subject would\nbe follow up with a phone\n\n210\n00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:20.830\ncall, Or however you wanna word it.\n\n211\n00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.930\nAnd let's give her one week.\n\n212\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.310\nSo now its priority is normal.\n\n213\n00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.190\nThe status is not normal.\n\n214\n00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.360\nI'm just setting up the subject and\nthe due date.\n\n215\n00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.800\nI'm creating an open activity.\n\n216\n00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.900\nIf I want a reminder, so\n\n217\n00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.740\na reminder will only pop up when\nyou're logged into Salesforce.\n\n218\n00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.640\nThis is another question\nI've seen on the exam.\n\n219\n00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.580\nReminders will not pop up anywhere else.\n\n220\n00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.080\nA reminder is not the same as an email.\n\n221\n00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:50.543\nAs a user is logged in, there will,\nif there are any tasks with reminders,\n\n222\n00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:54.732\nthat have gone past that reminder date or\nis at that time.\n\n223\n00:11:54.732 --> 00:11:57.380\nYou'll see a list of all your reminders.\n\n224\n00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.670\nAnd you can set the alarm.\n\n225\n00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.910\nAnd there's some configuration\nyou can do there which I'll show.\n\n226\n00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:05.550\nBut right now, I'm gonna set the reminder.\n\n227\n00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:10.420\nAnd to see if I can show you,\nwe're gonna go ahead and set it for today.\n\n228\n00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.924\nSo If, I think this is maybe on,\nso I'm gonna select today,\n\n229\n00:12:14.924 --> 00:12:17.100\nit's easy to pull the date.\n\n230\n00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.395\nMight be on Pacific Time.\n\n231\n00:12:18.395 --> 00:12:24.957\nSo let's go to, Or\n\n232\n00:12:24.957 --> 00:12:30.584\nlet's go to the next hour and see as we're\nworking through this what this looks like.\n\n233\n00:12:30.584 --> 00:12:33.892\n11 o'clock AM since I build my user,\nI might be on East side but\n\n234\n00:12:33.892 --> 00:12:38.320\nmy user is on different time zone, so\nthat's a good example to show that.\n\n235\n00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:44.366\nSo I'm gonna hit Save And\nnow we should all have\n\n236\n00:12:44.366 --> 00:12:50.440\none open activity and one record in\nthe activity history for this one account.\n\n237\n00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:56.040\nSo this is the call that was completed and\nthis is the open activity here.\n\n238\n00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.460\nNow there's two places to\ncomplete this activity.\n\n239\n00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.000\nSo let's say I made the phone\ncall earlier, that's fine too.\n\n240\n00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.030\nRight now,\nthis is showing who it's assigned to.\n\n241\n00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.680\nSo this is not a point,\nI assigned it to myself.\n\n242\n00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.790\nYou can be if you have\nthe right permissions\n\n243\n00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.800\nassign activities to other people.\n\n244\n00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.880\nSo just because I am creating,\nit doesn't mean,\n\n245\n00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:21.698\nit's necessarily assigned just to me,\nI can assign a lot of these tasks out.\n\n246\n00:13:21.698 --> 00:13:24.420\nSo, I'm gonna go from here,\nI can select Close and\n\n247\n00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.190\nI'll just close the activity itself.\n\n248\n00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:31.404\nOr I can open up the activity and\nchange the status, and\n\n249\n00:13:31.404 --> 00:13:35.533\nyou can configure the values\nthat you want here...\n\n250\n00:13:35.533 --> 00:13:37.490\nSo it's a few more clicks\nto do it that way.\n\n251\n00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:41.942\nI prefer to just mark it as closed, but\nmaybe you need to kinda mark it through\n\n252\n00:13:41.942 --> 00:13:45.504\na different process,\nmaybe it's a different type of task.\n\n253\n00:13:45.504 --> 00:13:49.970\nWhich brings me to my next point,\nof you can have task record types.\n\n254\n00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:54.070\nSo when you're bringing in custom fields\nif there's certain different types of\n\n255\n00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.860\ntasks you like to breakdown into different\ncategories, you can do so as well.\n\n256\n00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.110\nSo right now we don't have that set up but\n\n257\n00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.970\nmaybe you wanna move through\nin progress completed.\n\n258\n00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.650\nAnd this is great for project management.\n\n259\n00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:11.445\nFor any sales manager who wants\nto report or generate a report.\n\n260\n00:14:11.445 --> 00:14:16.791\nBased off all open tasks within, in\nprogress stage or they're not started and\n\n261\n00:14:16.791 --> 00:14:21.287\nyou can break that down or\nsummarize that down, the user itself.\n\n262\n00:14:21.287 --> 00:14:24.165\nHow many tasks does somebody have that's\non the weighted on somebody else.\n\n263\n00:14:24.165 --> 00:14:29.045\nSo this is a great project management\ntool or report to pull up.\n\n264\n00:14:29.045 --> 00:14:31.885\nThere's no automation at this point.\n\n265\n00:14:31.885 --> 00:14:36.342\nI could close it from this point and\nsave and create a new task, or save and\n\n266\n00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:37.595\ncreate a new event.\n\n267\n00:14:39.477 --> 00:14:41.940\nBut, I can also go back to my homepage.\n\n268\n00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.960\nAnd if we're heavily utilizing tasks.\n\n269\n00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.100\nI'm just gonna click All Open.\n\n270\n00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.160\nYou may have a list of them here.\n\n271\n00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.628\nAnd you can just mark through\nfrom your homepage complete.\n\n272\n00:14:51.628 --> 00:14:55.681\nAnd kind do those tasks that\nare related to different records and\n\n273\n00:14:55.681 --> 00:14:58.240\ncontacts and opportunities.\n\n274\n00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.230\nSo again all of these can\nhave different relationships.\n\n275\n00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:03.570\nSo I know at this point here,\nam I hover enabled?\n\n276\n00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.918\nI can hover over here and\nsee more details.\n\n277\n00:15:06.918 --> 00:15:09.150\nOr I might not have hover enabled but\n\n278\n00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:14.380\nthe checkbox you have set up in\nthe UI to have hover enabled.\n\n279\n00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:18.010\nAnd I can just put basic contact\ninformation like phone numbers.\n\n280\n00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:22.470\nSo I can work through my task\nlists at my homepage here.\n\n281\n00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:26.978\nSo that's kind of just a high level\nreview of the task activities and\n\n282\n00:15:26.978 --> 00:15:31.500\nevents activities which are tasks and\nevents, but let's go into.\n\n283\n00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.994\nSo I'm going through\nthe call details here.\n\n284\n00:15:35.994 --> 00:15:41.238\nI'm gonna go back into the account and\ncreate one, not in open activity history,\n\n285\n00:15:41.238 --> 00:15:46.810\nbut from a new task in the open activities\nsection, so you can see reoccurring.\n\n286\n00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:50.683\nSo Let's do follow up.\n\n287\n00:15:50.683 --> 00:15:53.531\nSo, maybe you need to follow up\nwith this specific account, and\n\n288\n00:15:53.531 --> 00:15:55.131\nI'm just sticking with accounts.\n\n289\n00:15:55.131 --> 00:15:59.099\nBut you can make more suggestions to\nyour org, as far as opportunities, and\n\n290\n00:15:59.099 --> 00:16:02.633\nthere's a lot of different ways to\nutilize this, and but this one,\n\n291\n00:16:02.633 --> 00:16:04.960\nlet's set up a reoccurrence.\n\n292\n00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.735\nSo I can set up a follow-up\nbased off of weekly, monthly,\n\n293\n00:16:08.735 --> 00:16:13.509\nmaybe I need to check in with this\nclient on a yearly basis, how often, and\n\n294\n00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:16.689\nthen you have to have a start date and\nan end date.\n\n295\n00:16:16.689 --> 00:16:20.515\nSo I have a lot of clients that want to\ncheck in with their clients maybe two\n\n296\n00:16:20.515 --> 00:16:21.370\ntimes a year.\n\n297\n00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:22.650\nYou can set that up.\n\n298\n00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.077\nHere and you'll get a task reminder.\n\n299\n00:16:24.077 --> 00:16:28.876\nIt's not completing the task for you,\nit's just reminding you as you're\n\n300\n00:16:28.876 --> 00:16:33.524\nworking from your home page this is\na list of tasks that are due this week or\n\n301\n00:16:33.524 --> 00:16:36.746\nit's overdue or\nsomething you need to complete.\n\n302\n00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:40.800\nAll right and then something I missed at\nthe very top to show the assigned to.\n\n303\n00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.300\nSo this is the point at\nwhich I'm creating the task.\n\n304\n00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:48.140\nI'm gonna remove my name and I'm gonna\nsearch with my lookup field here for\n\n305\n00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.890\nlist of users to assign this to.\n\n306\n00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.949\nSo, it will always keep the create\na date created by as myself but\n\n307\n00:16:53.949 --> 00:16:56.660\nit's showing you who am I assigning it to.\n\n308\n00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:00.680\nSo, it will not if I assign it to\nsomeone else, it will not show up on my\n\n309\n00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.779\nhomepage under open activities or task\nto do, it will show up under that users.\n\n310\n00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.535\nSo the next topic that\nI would like to cover,\n\n311\n00:17:11.535 --> 00:17:14.474\na smaller piece which\nis the Chatter feature.\n\n312\n00:17:14.474 --> 00:17:20.910\n1% but it's still good to know a lot of\norgs choose to use it or not to use it.\n\n313\n00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:24.090\nBut think of Chatter as\nyour internal communication\n\n314\n00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.630\nto each other within Salesforce.\n\n315\n00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:32.010\nI think it's a great object to\nuse to share information and\n\n316\n00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.970\nto add more engagement within your\nrecords and within Salesforce.\n\n317\n00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:38.923\nSo, let's just go through what Chatter\ndoes and what some of the features are.\n\n318\n00:17:38.923 --> 00:17:43.030\nCuz you may learn something new if you\nhaven't set it up for an org before.\n\n319\n00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.799\nAnd I think within the exam,\n\n320\n00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:49.535\nit's important to know all the features\nthat exist within Chatter itself.\n\n321\n00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:51.971\nSo being on my home screen too,\n\n322\n00:17:51.971 --> 00:17:57.610\nyou'll notice the show feed at\nthe very top across all your objects.\n\n323\n00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:59.200\nNow you can have chatter.\n\n324\n00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.920\nBy default it is enabled but you can\nhave that removed or you can expand it.\n\n325\n00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.200\nAnd right now we're looking\nat a list of my feed.\n\n326\n00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.670\nYou see my picture there because I added\npersonal information to my profile\n\n327\n00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:18.200\nwhich again it's similar to social\nmedia where you can at someone.\n\n328\n00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:24.360\nAdd a user and we'll see this across\nthe board and post files here.\n\n329\n00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.970\nCreate a new event from here.\n\n330\n00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.090\nSome of your other features.\n\n331\n00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:33.860\nLog a call and all of this within\nthe record itself in Salesforce so\n\n332\n00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.930\nright now this is my feed across\neverything in Salesforce.\n\n333\n00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.160\nNow if I go to the setup\n\n334\n00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:44.470\nmaybe there's not a feed internal\nobject that's important for you to see.\n\n335\n00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:53.390\nI'm going to go over to chatter setting\nand show you where you can enable it.\n\n336\n00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:55.250\nYou can enable whether\ngroups are involved.\n\n337\n00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:01.650\nYou can add a few more things,\napproval posts, adding the icons.\n\n338\n00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:04.510\nInvitations, all this is made here.\n\n339\n00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:09.572\nBut for\nthe feed tracking you're gonna come here.\n\n340\n00:19:09.572 --> 00:19:14.172\nAnd this is where you can identify what\ninformation is important to track as\n\n341\n00:19:14.172 --> 00:19:18.640\nfar as field changes within that\ntracking page on your home page here.\n\n342\n00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.131\nSo I've had requests where\nit's not important to track\n\n343\n00:19:23.131 --> 00:19:26.101\nthe owner as it is to track the stage.\n\n344\n00:19:26.101 --> 00:19:31.057\nAnd this is per object here, and this\nwill show you off the bat, as you go in,\n\n345\n00:19:31.057 --> 00:19:33.090\nwhat am I tracking currently?\n\n346\n00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:38.300\nI've had clients ask me to troubleshoot\nfor them, I'm coming on to my homepage and\n\n347\n00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:42.390\nI'm seeing information that's tracked for\nthis object and why am I seeing this.\n\n348\n00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:46.746\nAnd sometimes they're already frustrated\ncuz if you have it expanded it's gonna\n\n349\n00:19:46.746 --> 00:19:48.019\ntake up your full page.\n\n350\n00:19:48.019 --> 00:19:53.113\nSo, you'd navigate to feed tracking and\nyou go into the object and you can see,\n\n351\n00:19:53.113 --> 00:19:58.603\naha, case we're looking at two fields\npriority, maybe it's not important to see.\n\n352\n00:19:58.603 --> 00:20:01.290\nSo, that's where you navigate for there.\n\n353\n00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:07.770\nBut, let's get into the profile, and\nwhat you can see, what you can do.\n\n354\n00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:11.845\nSo, you can have, again, this is your\nfeed base, which we went over, but\n\n355\n00:20:11.845 --> 00:20:14.972\nyou can have an overview, and\nyou can have this per user.\n\n356\n00:20:14.972 --> 00:20:19.070\nSo again, like I mentioned,\nyour similar to like a social media.\n\n357\n00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:20.980\nYou have your contact information,\n\n358\n00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:24.330\nyou can make any other changes\nthat you want to add here.\n\n359\n00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:31.130\nWhat's your contribution to any of\nthese chat-like features that we have.\n\n360\n00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:32.695\nWhat do you know about, what's,\n\n361\n00:20:32.695 --> 00:20:37.980\nbasic contact information about yourself\nthat you wanna share with other users.\n\n362\n00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.270\nI've seen it used in\na lot of creative ways.\n\n363\n00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:44.129\nAnd as a partner of Salesforce,\nwe have a partner.\n\n364\n00:20:44.129 --> 00:20:51.010\nWe have a place where we can go to to open\ndifferent folders and files and groups.\n\n365\n00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.880\nSo maybe you can have groups created.\n\n366\n00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.596\nAnd as you see to the top right,\nright now it created a group for\n\n367\n00:20:56.596 --> 00:20:59.682\nall cloud C when I created\nmy user name and profile.\n\n368\n00:20:59.682 --> 00:21:01.508\nBut I can add groups here and\n\n369\n00:21:01.508 --> 00:21:06.530\nI can add groups as a system admin from\nmy sales users and marketing users.\n\n370\n00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.860\nAnd I can place appropriate people\nhere and what the great thing is,\n\n371\n00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.310\nis we can all share files.\n\n372\n00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:15.780\nAnd those are documents, and\nthey don't have to be related\n\n373\n00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.960\nspecifically to a record,\nthey can just live within that group.\n\n374\n00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.130\nMaybe it's PowerPoint presentations or\nmarketing material that you don't want,\n\n375\n00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:27.580\nand it's a private group that\nyou don't want any other\n\n376\n00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.260\nmember not a part of that group to see.\n\n377\n00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.724\nSo right now we're looking\nin the example all cloud c.\n\n378\n00:21:32.724 --> 00:21:36.753\nSo this is pulling from the company name\nbut here are some of the settings you can\n\n379\n00:21:36.753 --> 00:21:39.460\nmake in configurations\nwithin the group settings.\n\n380\n00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.420\nSo the name, the description and\nthe access level.\n\n381\n00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:51.041\nSo is this a public group Is it\na private group, so in that example it's\n\n382\n00:21:51.041 --> 00:21:56.495\nlocked in a sales group, and\nmarketing group, and support group.\n\n383\n00:21:56.495 --> 00:21:58.510\nAnd so these are your options here.\n\n384\n00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:02.611\nSo I'm gonna, if you want this open\nyou can read some more later, but\n\n385\n00:22:02.611 --> 00:22:07.303\nyou can see how it could be useful to kind\nof place members in different groups.\n\n386\n00:22:07.303 --> 00:22:13.260\nAnd you can invite people and add members\nand share records if it's accessible.\n\n387\n00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.230\nAnd see the engagement, create reports.\n\n388\n00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:20.870\nYou can email from here and add more info\nbut it's a great way to engage with other\n\n389\n00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:25.661\nusers in Salesforce and share information\nto help each other be more productive.\n\n390\n00:22:25.661 --> 00:22:31.220\nSo one other point too is as I'm\ngetting through this is so posting.\n\n391\n00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:35.170\nSo we utilize it as\na product management tool\n\n392\n00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:37.580\nas we're going through\na custom object name project.\n\n393\n00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.040\nSo if you're going through\nyour opportunities\n\n394\n00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:45.500\nlet's use the example as a sales manager\nI'm back at this opportunity here.\n\n395\n00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.460\nAnd we have chatter enabled.\n\n396\n00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:52.710\nI can at to the owner of the record or\nat any user, and simply say.\n\n397\n00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.038\nI think only myself will show.\n\n398\n00:22:55.038 --> 00:22:56.810\nSo similar to social media.\n\n399\n00:22:58.985 --> 00:23:03.415\nWhere are we on closing this deal,\nor if it was a case,\n\n400\n00:23:03.415 --> 00:23:07.264\nwhat's the case status, what's an update?\n\n401\n00:23:07.264 --> 00:23:10.945\nAnd anyone who has access to see\nthe record can pull down the feed and\n\n402\n00:23:10.945 --> 00:23:13.848\nsee the communication\nbetween everyone else here.\n\n403\n00:23:13.848 --> 00:23:18.260\nSo, attach a file if you think\nthat's gonna be helpful.\n\n404\n00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.520\nSo it's a pretty productive tool.\n\n405\n00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.320\nAnd you can create polls and add topics.\n\n406\n00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:29.230\nSo if the add topics relating to closing\ndeals or solutions, I can add topics here.\n\n407\n00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:35.098\nAnd let's say, open opportunities.\n\n408\n00:23:38.392 --> 00:23:41.685\nAnd now you can see there's\na topic I wanted to add\n\n409\n00:23:41.685 --> 00:23:45.630\nto it called Open Opportunity,\nsimilar to tags.\n\n410\n00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:50.180\nAnd now when I click this one that\nI created you can see the topics\n\n411\n00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:54.550\nwithin Chatter and\nthe feed related to that topic.\n\n412\n00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:59.137\n&gt;&gt; All right Felicia,\ngreat look there at some of the,\n\n413\n00:23:59.137 --> 00:24:02.049\nalmost like the social\ncapabilities of sales force,\n\n414\n00:24:02.049 --> 00:24:05.949\nyou have the ability to work with\nevents different acts of activities.\n\n415\n00:24:05.949 --> 00:24:08.518\nYou got events, and\ntask that we can work with.\n\n416\n00:24:08.518 --> 00:24:12.817\nAnd in the whole chatter,\nwhere we can really collaborate with our\n\n417\n00:24:12.817 --> 00:24:16.610\nco-workers as well as customers,\nSalesForce.\n\n418\n00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:17.782\nSo we appreciate that, great look there.\n\n419\n00:24:17.782 --> 00:24:21.110\nI hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n420\n00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:22.440\nSigning off for ITPro.TV.\n\n421\n00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.011\nI've been your host, Mick Rodrick.\n\n422\n00:24:24.011 --> 00:24:25.342\n&gt;&gt; I'm

00:00:06.405\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:08.277\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.277 --> 00:00:12.376\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:12.376 --> 00:00:16.049\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.513\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\n\n8\n00:00:17.513 --> 00:00:20.509\ntoday we're doing our\nSalesforce Certified Administrator.\n\n9\n00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.897\nAnd in this episode, we're going to be\ntaking a look at data management and\n\n10\n00:00:24.897 --> 00:00:25.813\ndata loaders.\n\n11\n00:00:25.813 --> 00:00:29.964\nAnd here to load us up with all kinds of\nuseful information is Miss Felicia Duarte.\n\n12\n00:00:29.964 --> 00:00:31.108\nWelcome back, Felicia.\n\n13\n00:00:31.108 --> 00:00:32.266\n&gt;&gt; Great, thank you.\n\n14\n00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:35.749\nSo in this episode,\nI want to cover data loaders and\n\n15\n00:00:35.749 --> 00:00:38.700\ndata management within Salesforce.\n\n16\n00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.750\nSo this holds 9% weight\nwithin the exam itself.\n\n17\n00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.142\nSo I would make sure to do a test import,\nmake sure you're completely aware.\n\n18\n00:00:46.142 --> 00:00:50.538\nTroubleshoot some issues on what you can\ndo within Salesforce regarding your data.\n\n19\n00:00:50.538 --> 00:00:54.910\nRegarding existing data,\nimporting new data, upserting,\n\n20\n00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.870\nupdating data within Salesforce,\ncleaning out data.\n\n21\n00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.170\nSo those are some of the goals and\ntopics of this episode today.\n\n22\n00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.265\nAnd we're gonna start with your homepage.\n\n23\n00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:06.515\nSo I'm gonna navigate over here.\n\n24\n00:01:06.515 --> 00:01:11.268\nAnd how to import records in\ndifferent places within Salesforce?\n\n25\n00:01:11.268 --> 00:01:14.011\nSo as you saw in some of\nthe previous episodes.\n\n26\n00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:16.881\nEvery time you go into an object,\nstandard object,\n\n27\n00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:19.330\nor even a custom object within Salesforce.\n\n28\n00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.990\nYou have options to run reports,\nrecent accounts, but\n\n29\n00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.220\nyou'll see a section here called Tools.\n\n30\n00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.300\nNow in this section here,\nthey vary by a standard object to object.\n\n31\n00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.530\nBut for the main ones like accounts,\nand contacts, and\n\n32\n00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.018\nleads, you're gonna see\nthe options to run imports.\n\n33\n00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:40.094\nNow we're in the Account object here so\n[INAUDIBLE] option to run Import for\n\n34\n00:01:40.094 --> 00:01:41.746\nboth accounts and contacts.\n\n35\n00:01:41.746 --> 00:01:47.898\nNow you can certainly run your imports and\nadd records from here.\n\n36\n00:01:47.898 --> 00:01:51.280\nAnd so we're gonna start here just\nto show you one way to do so.\n\n37\n00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:58.070\nSo the very first step, as an admin I'm\nsure you've run in to this issue before.\n\n38\n00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.318\nYou're gonna want a clean house.\n\n39\n00:02:00.318 --> 00:02:02.178\nSo make sure your data is clean.\n\n40\n00:02:02.178 --> 00:02:04.528\nBecause you don't wanna\npush in dirty data.\n\n41\n00:02:04.528 --> 00:02:08.517\nYou wanna check to make sure you\ndon't have any duplicate data.\n\n42\n00:02:08.517 --> 00:02:11.327\nIf you're just gonna push in from scratch\n\n43\n00:02:11.327 --> 00:02:14.507\nthat's probably the best way when\nyou're working with a new org.\n\n44\n00:02:14.507 --> 00:02:16.461\nCheck the spreadsheet first.\n\n45\n00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:21.170\nNow, I'm gonna go through and troubleshoot\nthrough some common scenarios that I\n\n46\n00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.480\nsee often as I'm doing import records.\n\n47\n00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.380\nBut this data import wizard that\nSalesforce gives you out of the boxes\n\n48\n00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.160\nis great.\n\n49\n00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.060\nIt's easy to do.\n\n50\n00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.350\nIt's easy to understand.\n\n51\n00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.280\nIf you're not working\nwith large sets of data,\n\n52\n00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.380\nbecause you can only do\n50,000 records at a time.\n\n53\n00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.274\nIf we're going over 100,000 and 50,000,\n\n54\n00:02:40.274 --> 00:02:44.080\nyou're gonna wanna break that up if\nyou're still gonna utilize this way.\n\n55\n00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.220\nBut there are other\nalternatives to importing data.\n\n56\n00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.785\nSo let's launch the wizard and\ngo through the steps.\n\n57\n00:02:50.785 --> 00:02:54.332\nSo we can see here,\nPrepare your data for import.\n\n58\n00:02:54.332 --> 00:02:57.125\nSo if we're gonna import object by object,\n\n59\n00:02:57.125 --> 00:03:00.077\nyou can't import multiple\nobjects at a time.\n\n60\n00:03:00.077 --> 00:03:04.900\nSo if you're gonna import contacts,\nyou wanna import the accounts first.\n\n61\n00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.784\nBecause you're gonna wanna pull out\nthe account's Salesforce ID in order to\n\n62\n00:03:09.784 --> 00:03:13.220\nassociate the contact with that account.\n\n63\n00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.832\nSo we're gonna start with\nsomething real simple like leads.\n\n64\n00:03:15.832 --> 00:03:19.248\nLeads is probably one of the easiest\nthings to import because there's no\n\n65\n00:03:19.248 --> 00:03:19.978\nassociation.\n\n66\n00:03:19.978 --> 00:03:26.232\nThere's no separate objects or\ndatabase tables to associate it to.\n\n67\n00:03:26.232 --> 00:03:28.433\nSo prepare your data.\n\n68\n00:03:28.433 --> 00:03:30.654\nLook at what the required\nfields are first.\n\n69\n00:03:30.654 --> 00:03:32.830\nBecause that's one step.\n\n70\n00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.380\nThe data, the import file will not\npass if there are certain validations.\n\n71\n00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.919\nOr if there are required fields that\nare not included in your CSV columns.\n\n72\n00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.082\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\nlaunch the wizard here.\n\n73\n00:03:48.082 --> 00:03:53.335\nAnd if you need help importing,\nrecheck this video, watch some videos.\n\n74\n00:03:53.335 --> 00:03:55.252\nGet a developer account,\n\n75\n00:03:55.252 --> 00:04:00.754\ntest out some records yourself before\nyou do a final push into production.\n\n76\n00:04:00.754 --> 00:04:05.010\nOr we'll create a sandbox environment,\nyour testing environment,\n\n77\n00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.967\nto play with the testing there.\n\n78\n00:04:06.967 --> 00:04:11.930\nIf you have existing data and\nyour org is already being used.\n\n79\n00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.589\nSo, let's launch the wizard, and\n\n80\n00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:19.115\nyou can see here they give you\nsome positive encouragement.\n\n81\n00:04:19.115 --> 00:04:19.855\nLet's do this.\n\n82\n00:04:19.855 --> 00:04:22.346\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And you have the choice.\n\n83\n00:04:22.346 --> 00:04:23.490\nIt kinda walks you through.\n\n84\n00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.890\nIt's nice,\ncuz it walks you through these prompts.\n\n85\n00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.950\nSo, what's the object\nyou wanna start with?\n\n86\n00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.849\nKeeps it real simple, Leads.\n\n87\n00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.193\nWhat do you wanna do?\n\n88\n00:04:31.193 --> 00:04:34.090\nYou give it a second,\nI wanna add new records,\n\n89\n00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.850\nor I wanna make update\nto existing records.\n\n90\n00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.240\nLet's stick here.\n\n91\n00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.040\nIf you wanna update existing records,\nyou wanna pull out and\n\n92\n00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.420\nuse what Salesforce calls\nour Salesforce unique ID.\n\n93\n00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.801\nEvery record in Salesforce\nhas a Salesforce ID.\n\n94\n00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:54.265\nAnd I believe it's a 15,\nand I would check on that,\n\n95\n00:04:54.265 --> 00:04:59.539\nit's a 15 digit number that\nyou want to use, alphanumeric.\n\n96\n00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.500\nThat's unique to the record to\ngo back in and make changes to.\n\n97\n00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.840\nSo right now, we're just gonna keep\nit simple and do Add New Records, but\n\n98\n00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.580\nyou can do both.\n\n99\n00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.896\nWhat we consider an upsert.\n\n100\n00:05:08.896 --> 00:05:13.066\nSo add new records and\nupdate existing records.\n\n101\n00:05:13.066 --> 00:05:16.669\nSo these are your three options\nhere using this wizard.\n\n102\n00:05:17.977 --> 00:05:23.593\nNow, with other areas to import you\ncan also do mass deletes or changes.\n\n103\n00:05:23.593 --> 00:05:25.655\nBut within this wizard here,\n\n104\n00:05:25.655 --> 00:05:30.858\nif you're only looking to do those\nthree options, you can do so from here.\n\n105\n00:05:30.858 --> 00:05:34.037\nSo if we're going to match records and\nadd new records,\n\n106\n00:05:34.037 --> 00:05:37.070\nare you matching with a name or email?\n\n107\n00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.239\nDo you need to assign new\nleads to this source?\n\n108\n00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.301\nSo these are your source options here.\n\n109\n00:05:42.301 --> 00:05:43.971\nSo it's going to be based off\nthe fields that you have.\n\n110\n00:05:43.971 --> 00:05:45.832\nWe're gonna keep it at none, and\n\n111\n00:05:45.832 --> 00:05:49.497\n[INAUDIBLE] assigned all leads\nusing any of the assignment rules.\n\n112\n00:05:49.497 --> 00:05:52.981\nSo it's gonna look to the assignment\nrules, but we're gonna select None, and\n\n113\n00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:54.530\nkeep it real simple.\n\n114\n00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.700\nAnd then drag your CSV files here.\n\n115\n00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.041\nSo I'm gonna go into This file, and\n\n116\n00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:04.510\nI have it already ready, and\nbefore I do that, let's open it up.\n\n117\n00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.242\nSo, we're gonna map, and\nI'm gonna take it a step back,\n\n118\n00:06:09.242 --> 00:06:11.353\ncuz I have this for\naccounts and not leads.\n\n119\n00:06:11.353 --> 00:06:13.700\n[LAUGH] So, I'm gonna take it a step back.\n\n120\n00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.971\nAnd you certainly wanna\ndouble check your work.\n\n121\n00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:21.210\n[LAUGH] So, this is a good example, that\nyou're importing into the right object.\n\n122\n00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.450\nOtherwise you're going back.\n\n123\n00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.580\nAnd you're gonna get a,\nI would've done it this way.\n\n124\n00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.660\nI'm gonna not find a mapping.\n\n125\n00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.090\nI'm gonna get an error.\n\n126\n00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.000\nAnd that will kind of alert me that,\nhey you're mapping to the wrong objects.\n\n127\n00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.820\nSo I like that I can go back and from the\nsame page select Accounts and Contacts.\n\n128\n00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.160\nAnd then we're gonna do Add New Records,\nand it's gonna follow the same prompts.\n\n129\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.780\nHow do you wanna match your contact?\n\n130\n00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.780\nBy name.\n\n131\n00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.362\nMatch account?\n\n132\n00:06:46.362 --> 00:06:48.856\nBy name and site, or select None.\n\n133\n00:06:48.856 --> 00:06:51.430\nAnd do we wanna trigger any workflows?\n\n134\n00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:57.446\nWe don't have any active workflows\nat the time, or processes.\n\n135\n00:06:57.446 --> 00:07:01.090\nAnd we don't need to assign all contacts\nto any campaigns at this point.\n\n136\n00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.610\nWe simply just want to add accounts.\n\n137\n00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.537\nSo we'll do the same thing and drag but\n\n138\n00:07:06.537 --> 00:07:11.768\nlets take a look at this file and\nlet's go into, I'm gonna copy this\n\n139\n00:07:16.322 --> 00:07:23.430\nAnd I'm going to try to navigate back\ninto the account object to show you.\n\n140\n00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:28.265\nSo this is a second tab and just to show\nyou the mapping and how everything looks.\n\n141\n00:07:28.265 --> 00:07:32.348\nSo we need to have an account name,\nwhich we do.\n\n142\n00:07:32.348 --> 00:07:34.185\nAnd I pulled in some of the fields here.\n\n143\n00:07:34.185 --> 00:07:36.390\nSo account number, it's a number field.\n\n144\n00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.880\nMake sure that the field types map.\n\n145\n00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.834\nIf it's a currency,\n\n146\n00:07:38.834 --> 00:07:42.071\nit has to be a currency amount with\nthe decimal points that you selected.\n\n147\n00:07:42.071 --> 00:07:46.720\nIf it's a pick list value,\nit has to be spelled accurately,\n\n148\n00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.017\nthe value that exists and\nis active within Salesforce.\n\n149\n00:07:51.017 --> 00:07:52.559\nSo, we're talking one record.\n\n150\n00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:53.568\nThis is gonna be simple.\n\n151\n00:07:53.568 --> 00:07:56.821\nBut when you're working with\nthousands of records at a time,\n\n152\n00:07:56.821 --> 00:07:59.272\nyou can't go in individually and\ncheck that.\n\n153\n00:07:59.272 --> 00:08:03.670\nSo, I would just do Sort Filters,\nreally know your Excel.\n\n154\n00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:08.801\nHow to make changes, how to check and\nmake sure that those values are separated.\n\n155\n00:08:08.801 --> 00:08:13.447\nAnd if you find a value within your\nspreadsheet that doesn't exist as a value\n\n156\n00:08:13.447 --> 00:08:14.475\nin Salesforce.\n\n157\n00:08:14.475 --> 00:08:18.985\nYou want to go in and either delete and\nchange that value before importing.\n\n158\n00:08:18.985 --> 00:08:23.960\nOr you want to go back into Salesforce and\nadd that value to that field.\n\n159\n00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:29.340\nAnother common issue that we\ncome across is when you're\n\n160\n00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.900\npulling in or bringing in data from\nanother database is the streets.\n\n161\n00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.960\nSo sometimes it's all in one field so\nyou need to break that down.\n\n162\n00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.550\nSalesforce has it broken down into\nthe street, city, zip, country.\n\n163\n00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:44.629\nSo you wanna make sure that is split up,\n\n164\n00:08:44.629 --> 00:08:48.605\nif it's not you wanna utilize Excel\nto split them into different columns.\n\n165\n00:08:48.605 --> 00:08:52.746\nAnd then, again, number of fields,\nmake sure they're in the right category.\n\n166\n00:08:52.746 --> 00:08:56.372\nWebsite's pretty simple and\nthen everything else.\n\n167\n00:08:56.372 --> 00:08:59.230\nI don't necessarily need\nto have every column here.\n\n168\n00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:02.693\nI can just import the data\nthat I wanna import.\n\n169\n00:09:02.693 --> 00:09:06.542\nSo I can do three different imports at\ndifferent times just to update the type or\n\n170\n00:09:06.542 --> 00:09:07.722\nfields individually.\n\n171\n00:09:07.722 --> 00:09:10.867\nAnd doesn't have to be all\nthe fields as a whole.\n\n172\n00:09:10.867 --> 00:09:13.440\nSo right now we're just\ngonna do the accounts.\n\n173\n00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:19.729\nEverything looks good, so I'm going\nto go back and drop that over Here.\n\n174\n00:09:31.011 --> 00:09:35.132\nSo the check box is green,\nit is an accurate CSV file, so\n\n175\n00:09:35.132 --> 00:09:38.140\nmake sure to save as a CSV file.\n\n176\n00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.181\nAnd we're just gonna follow\nthe prompts and hit Next.\n\n177\n00:09:43.695 --> 00:09:49.658\nSo if the column names are named in\nthe exact same format as the field's name,\n\n178\n00:09:49.658 --> 00:09:51.970\nit's gonna find you a match.\n\n179\n00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.420\nSo it always makes it easier to have\nthe columns ready to go and named.\n\n180\n00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.530\nBut if not, that's fine.\n\n181\n00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:03.265\nIf I wanted to map the account\nname to another field.\n\n182\n00:10:03.265 --> 00:10:06.399\nOr [LAUGH] I start making custom fields\nand they're a little bit different,\n\n183\n00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:07.204\nthat's okay too.\n\n184\n00:10:07.204 --> 00:10:09.726\nYou can select the unmapped.\n\n185\n00:10:09.726 --> 00:10:11.858\nGo into the runs and select Map.\n\n186\n00:10:11.858 --> 00:10:15.375\nAnd you can make changes and then let it\nknow which one you want to map it to.\n\n187\n00:10:15.375 --> 00:10:19.251\nSo we're looking at Revenue,\nit says Revenue in my column,\n\n188\n00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:22.524\nbut that needs to actually\nbill to annual revenue.\n\n189\n00:10:22.524 --> 00:10:23.992\nWhich is this one here.\n\n190\n00:10:23.992 --> 00:10:26.649\nSo you can kind of see how easy\nit is to make those changes.\n\n191\n00:10:26.649 --> 00:10:29.980\nReal simple,\notherwise if it was to just push it in,\n\n192\n00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.342\nit would be an unsuccessful import.\n\n193\n00:10:32.342 --> 00:10:40.780\nAnd then Billing Zip, so it's\nBilling Zip Postal Code, and map it there.\n\n194\n00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:41.540\nAnd then it looks good.\n\n195\n00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.530\nEverything looks good.\n\n196\n00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:43.420\nEverything's mapped.\n\n197\n00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.090\nThis will show you right here\nwhat's the Salesforce object.\n\n198\n00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.490\nWhat's the header in my CSV file?\n\n199\n00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.150\nAnd then what's this going to look\nlike once it actually pushes over?\n\n200\n00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.823\nSo I'm gonna select Next.\n\n201\n00:10:55.823 --> 00:10:57.857\nWe're at our last step here.\n\n202\n00:10:57.857 --> 00:11:01.020\nAnd now this is reviewing everything.\n\n203\n00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.650\nHey, you're looking to map 11 fields,\nzero of them are unmapped.\n\n204\n00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.127\nIf we're talking more data, more columns.\n\n205\n00:11:08.127 --> 00:11:10.290\nAnd we're gonna start the import.\n\n206\n00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.748\nSo, this is letting you know\nthat import has started.\n\n207\n00:11:13.748 --> 00:11:17.905\nAnd it's gonna take you over to the bulk\ndata load job within Salesforce.\n\n208\n00:11:17.905 --> 00:11:21.948\nWhere you have details to\nthe operation you're trying to do,\n\n209\n00:11:21.948 --> 00:11:23.900\nto the start date, end time.\n\n210\n00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.467\nAll of these details here.\n\n211\n00:11:26.467 --> 00:11:30.516\nThe operation is we're looking\nto insert a new record.\n\n212\n00:11:30.516 --> 00:11:32.460\nSo we can review the results.\n\n213\n00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:37.594\nAnd you'll be prompted and you'll\nreceive an email once it's successful.\n\n214\n00:11:37.594 --> 00:11:41.756\nAnd if I scroll down,\nwhat's the records process?\n\n215\n00:11:41.756 --> 00:11:42.807\nWhat's the fail count?\n\n216\n00:11:42.807 --> 00:11:49.745\nWhat's the retry count on this specific\nload and let's view the result.\n\n217\n00:11:49.745 --> 00:11:53.685\nAnd you can generate, you can pull that\nup but let's go ahead and check and see.\n\n218\n00:11:53.685 --> 00:11:55.285\nDid that record get created?\n\n219\n00:11:55.285 --> 00:11:57.002\nSo I'm gonna go back, just so\n\n220\n00:11:57.002 --> 00:12:00.730\nyou can see the list of monitoring\nthese bulk data loading jobs.\n\n221\n00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.166\nAnd this was an attempt I did earlier,\njust to make sure.\n\n222\n00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:08.363\nAnd we're gonna see the records so\nfar that processed.\n\n223\n00:12:08.363 --> 00:12:10.827\nSo we're gonna look into Accounts.\n\n224\n00:12:10.827 --> 00:12:14.030\nWhen we're talking one record,\nit's gonna be pretty quick but\n\n225\n00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:17.065\nwhen you're talking a group of records,\ngive it some time.\n\n226\n00:12:17.065 --> 00:12:21.709\nSo, let's go hit Go.\n\n227\n00:12:21.709 --> 00:12:23.841\nAnd I'm gonna use this up here.\n\n228\n00:12:23.841 --> 00:12:24.831\nIt's helpful.\n\n229\n00:12:24.831 --> 00:12:28.782\nAnd we see here the test\naccount that we created.\n\n230\n00:12:28.782 --> 00:12:31.289\nAnd how the fields were pushed in.\n\n231\n00:12:31.289 --> 00:12:34.037\nAnd to make sure this was the right one,\n\n232\n00:12:34.037 --> 00:12:37.632\nI'm gonna look at my created date,\nor created by.\n\n233\n00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:41.042\nAnd this will show the accountability,\nwho created this record and at what time.\n\n234\n00:12:41.042 --> 00:12:44.958\nSo when you're working with different\ndata loaders and pushing in information.\n\n235\n00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.365\nThis field here and last modified field,\n\n236\n00:12:47.365 --> 00:12:51.026\nthese two dates are gonna be\nthe most useful to check your data.\n\n237\n00:12:51.026 --> 00:12:56.280\nOr go back in and make changes\nto incorrect uploads or upserts.\n\n238\n00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:01.816\nIt's just kind of a way to troubleshoot\nany issues that you can come across.\n\n239\n00:13:01.816 --> 00:13:03.559\nSo again we're in Pacific Standard Time.\n\n240\n00:13:03.559 --> 00:13:06.896\nSo this was the import,\nthis is the changes that were made here.\n\n241\n00:13:06.896 --> 00:13:13.422\nAnd you can see how easy it was to\nimport a record using the data loader.\n\n242\n00:13:13.422 --> 00:13:15.840\nSo let's go back into the home page.\n\n243\n00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.418\nSo now you've seen how to upload data.\n\n244\n00:13:18.418 --> 00:13:24.570\nAnd you can see from here you can also\nat this point mass delete accounts.\n\n245\n00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.895\nAnd these are existing\naccounts within Salesforce and\n\n246\n00:13:27.895 --> 00:13:31.952\nyou can merge these accounts and\ntransfer accounts at this point.\n\n247\n00:13:31.952 --> 00:13:32.632\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n248\n00:13:32.632 --> 00:13:36.560\npretty cool wizard that allows us to get\nthat data into the system and Salesforce.\n\n249\n00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.250\nWhat about trying to get that\ndata back out if we need it?\n\n250\n00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:40.441\n&gt;&gt; Great question!\n\n251\n00:13:40.441 --> 00:13:42.882\nSo let's go back into the data management.\n\n252\n00:13:42.882 --> 00:13:46.446\nSo we're going to go to set up,\nour quick find.\n\n253\n00:13:46.446 --> 00:13:50.175\nAnd let's go to the data management\nsection within Salesforce so\n\n254\n00:13:50.175 --> 00:13:52.560\nI'm gonna navigate over to Data Export.\n\n255\n00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.510\nNow this is a great feature\nthat Salesforce has\n\n256\n00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.170\nbecause you can have\nscheduled exports ran.\n\n257\n00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.269\nAnd this is something\nthat you may wanna do or\n\n258\n00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:03.234\nsomething I would suggest to\nhave running in the background.\n\n259\n00:14:03.234 --> 00:14:04.729\nBut there are a few\nthings to keep in mind.\n\n260\n00:14:04.729 --> 00:14:09.659\nSo if I do not have a current export\nalready scheduled within this 48\n\n261\n00:14:09.659 --> 00:14:13.160\nhour time period we can do an export now.\n\n262\n00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.220\nSo I'm looking and saying, okay,\nyou don't have one already scheduled.\n\n263\n00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.210\nSo, what's the file type\nI'm looking to pull here?\n\n264\n00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.093\nI'm sorry, what's the encoding?\n\n265\n00:14:22.093 --> 00:14:26.440\nThis will do a full back up of your\nSalesforce work at this point.\n\n266\n00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.044\nSo, if you are looking to capture images,\ndocuments,\n\n267\n00:14:30.044 --> 00:14:32.280\nfiles, make sure to select this.\n\n268\n00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:38.703\nAnd this field here to include the files\nand CRM content and the content versions.\n\n269\n00:14:38.703 --> 00:14:42.616\nIf you're looking for everything,\nmake sure everything is selected.\n\n270\n00:14:42.616 --> 00:14:43.526\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n271\n00:14:43.526 --> 00:14:45.017\n&gt;&gt; But if you wanna keep it more,\n\n272\n00:14:45.017 --> 00:14:48.486\njust hey, I wanna do an export of\nmy accounts and contacts right now.\n\n273\n00:14:48.486 --> 00:14:52.931\nThen you have the option of which data\ndo you want to collect, or export out.\n\n274\n00:14:52.931 --> 00:14:57.732\nSo by default include all data,\nbecause this is mostly being used as\n\n275\n00:14:57.732 --> 00:15:01.370\na backup of your data,\ninclude all data selected.\n\n276\n00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.991\nBut let me see here.\n\n277\n00:15:04.991 --> 00:15:07.451\nSo I think by default it's just\nletting you include all data.\n\n278\n00:15:07.451 --> 00:15:11.840\n[LAUGH] So let's go ahead,\nthese are your options here.\n\n279\n00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.596\nOkay, here we go.\n\n280\n00:15:12.596 --> 00:15:15.639\nI was looking to see why\n[LAUGH] it would let me select.\n\n281\n00:15:15.639 --> 00:15:19.032\nSo you don't have to deselect\nit before selecting as we found.\n\n282\n00:15:19.032 --> 00:15:21.835\nSo you can just select\nat this point topics.\n\n283\n00:15:21.835 --> 00:15:24.289\nI mean it gets real granular,\ntopics, these are activities.\n\n284\n00:15:24.289 --> 00:15:28.596\nBut most of the time it could just\nbe contacts, accounts, orders, or\n\n285\n00:15:28.596 --> 00:15:32.380\nopportunities, or\nhey I just wanna do an export of my leads.\n\n286\n00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:33.787\nSo that's the place to do that.\n\n287\n00:15:33.787 --> 00:15:35.747\nI'm not gonna start the export,\n\n288\n00:15:35.747 --> 00:15:38.976\nbecause I wanna show you how\nto run scheduled exports.\n\n289\n00:15:38.976 --> 00:15:43.380\nSo you can select the second button\nfrom this page of scheduling an export.\n\n290\n00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:48.410\nNow, this can be ran same features,\nyou can do the include all data or\n\n291\n00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:51.900\njust do an export on certain objects.\n\n292\n00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.270\nBut you select the start date and\nan end date of this frequency,\n\n293\n00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:59.920\nand you can select once every month,\ntwice every month.\n\n294\n00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.754\nYou have these filter criteria here.\n\n295\n00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:05.271\nIs it on the first Sunday of every month,\n\n296\n00:16:05.271 --> 00:16:08.764\nhow often do you wanna have\nthis running in the backend?\n\n297\n00:16:08.764 --> 00:16:11.413\nAnd then again it depends how much\ndata you have living in here and\n\n298\n00:16:11.413 --> 00:16:13.490\nhow long that's gonna take to pull and\ngenerate.\n\n299\n00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.940\nSo, keep that in mind.\n\n300\n00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.440\nI've worked with some orgs and\noccurences that\n\n301\n00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.475\nI've gone through where they are looking\nto move away into different orgs.\n\n302\n00:16:22.475 --> 00:16:25.530\nThey're looking to go from maybe\na professional edition of Salesforce into\n\n303\n00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:26.630\nan enterprise edition.\n\n304\n00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.267\nAnd that's a completely new org.\n\n305\n00:16:28.267 --> 00:16:32.986\nSo we need to collect all the data from\ntheir Salesforce Professional edition.\n\n306\n00:16:32.986 --> 00:16:38.346\nExport that out and push into\nan enterprise Salesforce [INAUDIBLE].\n\n307\n00:16:38.346 --> 00:16:40.741\nAnd make sure everything maps and aligns.\n\n308\n00:16:40.741 --> 00:16:44.409\nNow in that scenario if they have\nthese exports already running and\n\n309\n00:16:44.409 --> 00:16:46.860\nwe're looking to do it today.\n\n310\n00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:51.280\nYou, one, either need to log a case\nwith Salesforce and have them do it.\n\n311\n00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.688\nOtherwise, we have to stop this export and\nwait for\n\n312\n00:16:54.688 --> 00:16:59.377\nthat to complete before we can run and\ngenerate the Export Now option.\n\n313\n00:16:59.377 --> 00:17:02.865\nAnd in that case, you need to\nmake sure everything's selected.\n\n314\n00:17:02.865 --> 00:17:07.380\nIf you're looking at pushing all content\nand data into a completely new org.\n\n315\n00:17:08.952 --> 00:17:09.650\n&gt;&gt; All right Felicia,\n\n316\n00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:13.030\nagain, another great look there at some of\nthe things we can do inside Salesforce.\n\n317\n00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:16.200\nHere we were looking at how we\ncan get data into Salesforce, so\n\n318\n00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.990\ndifferent import and loader methods.\n\n319\n00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.977\nWe also looked at how we can get data out.\n\n320\n00:17:19.977 --> 00:17:23.523\nIf we need to maybe work with\nthat data in another application.\n\n321\n00:17:23.523 --> 00:17:26.523\nOr simply to make sure we've got\na good backup of that data or\n\n322\n00:17:26.523 --> 00:17:28.850\nif we're moving from one org to another.\n\n323\n00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:29.760\nSo we thank you for that.\n\n324\n00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.270\nGreat demonstrations there.\n\n325\n00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.910\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n326\n00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:35.140\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV.\n\n327\n00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.230\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n328\n00:17:37.230 -->

00:00:08.863\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:10.719\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.256\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:17.018\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\n\n7\n00:00:17.018 --> 00:00:21.600\nand today we're doing our\nSalesforce Certified Administrator.\n\n8\n00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.347\nIn this episode, we're gonna take\na look at how we can use reports and\n\n9\n00:00:25.347 --> 00:00:27.168\ndashboards to analyze our data.\n\n10\n00:00:27.168 --> 00:00:30.240\nAnd here to help us with\nthat is Miss Felicia Duarte.\n\n11\n00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.180\nWelcome back Felicia.\n\n12\n00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.380\n&gt;&gt; Great, thank you.\n\n13\n00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.160\nSo, in this episode we're\ngonna cover reports.\n\n14\n00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.185\nLet's start out with\nthe report properties.\n\n15\n00:00:38.185 --> 00:00:40.505\nWhat are the different types of reports?\n\n16\n00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:44.925\nWe're also gonna cover dashboards, how\nto link reports and dashboards together.\n\n17\n00:00:44.925 --> 00:00:48.945\nWhat type of data and reports can I\nrun that are standard from Salesforce?\n\n18\n00:00:48.945 --> 00:00:51.866\nAnd what are some custom report\ntypes that I can create?\n\n19\n00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:57.454\nSo to start, I'm gonna hop right\nin into the reports object and\n\n20\n00:00:57.454 --> 00:01:00.203\nstart with creating a report.\n\n21\n00:01:00.203 --> 00:01:02.480\nSo we're gonna navigate over here.\n\n22\n00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.230\nAnd to start,\nwe're at the report home page.\n\n23\n00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.230\nSo this object looks different than any\nother object that you see in Salesforce.\n\n24\n00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.290\nSo to your left, you have your folders.\n\n25\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.600\nNow, when you create a report,\nwhich you'll see,\n\n26\n00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.700\nyou have to select from which object\nam I creating this report from.\n\n27\n00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.600\nIs it my account and contacts,\nmy leads, my opportunities?\n\n28\n00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.170\nOr if it's a custom object,\nyou wanna do a custom report type.\n\n29\n00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.765\nBut, as you're building an object,\n\n30\n00:01:28.765 --> 00:01:32.816\nit'll add it's own other folder,\nwhich we'll get into.\n\n31\n00:01:32.816 --> 00:01:36.226\nJust coming out straight from Salesforce,\nyou can see that it breaks it up and\n\n32\n00:01:36.226 --> 00:01:38.100\ngives you a lot of great useful reports.\n\n33\n00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.874\nSo it gives you from opportunity reports.\n\n34\n00:01:39.874 --> 00:01:43.573\nIt'll automatically create\na closed opportunities,\n\n35\n00:01:43.573 --> 00:01:47.610\ncontact role reports,\nforecasting, your pipeline.\n\n36\n00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.861\nSo being acquainted with what\nSalesforce gives you is great.\n\n37\n00:01:50.861 --> 00:01:54.820\nAs admin, to start at the box so\nyou're not duplicating your work.\n\n38\n00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.110\nOr, even greater,\nuse what they give you as a baseline, and\n\n39\n00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.200\nthen make customizations from there.\n\n40\n00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.742\nClone the report, save as the report,\nrather than building from scratch.\n\n41\n00:02:04.742 --> 00:02:09.251\nAnd this is also the same\nplace where dashboards live.\n\n42\n00:02:09.251 --> 00:02:13.756\nAnd the creation, or the place to create a\ndashboard, is all held in the same place.\n\n43\n00:02:13.756 --> 00:02:18.302\nSo new reports and new dashboards,\nyou see these buttons at the very top,\n\n44\n00:02:18.302 --> 00:02:19.855\nthis is your place to go.\n\n45\n00:02:19.855 --> 00:02:25.930\nBut you can segment your folders\ninto different folder names.\n\n46\n00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.320\nRight now, we're gonna go ahead and name,\n\n47\n00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.690\nI like to always create\na new report folder.\n\n48\n00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.030\nThis way I have the ones that\nare customized to my order that I'm in, so\n\n49\n00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.390\nusing the company name, and you can\nuse and title this however you want.\n\n50\n00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.990\nUse Cloud Creations, hit tab,\nit will give me my API name, and hit Save.\n\n51\n00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.485\nSo now I see it's gonna\nbe placed right here.\n\n52\n00:02:47.485 --> 00:02:50.695\nBut for\nreport folders that are important for\n\n53\n00:02:50.695 --> 00:02:54.012\nme to get into I can store\nmany reports in here.\n\n54\n00:02:54.012 --> 00:02:58.530\nI'm gonna pin this to the top and\nI can also share this.\n\n55\n00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.600\nSo I can unpin it.\n\n56\n00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.182\nI can share it.\n\n57\n00:03:00.182 --> 00:03:01.002\nI can edit it.\n\n58\n00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:01.977\nI'm gonna select share.\n\n59\n00:03:01.977 --> 00:03:04.420\nAnd you can see who do\nyou wanna share it with?\n\n60\n00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.980\nWhat access to you wanna give them?\n\n61\n00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.608\nIs it a user,\nis it based off a certain group of roles?\n\n62\n00:03:09.608 --> 00:03:12.470\nYou have a few options here.\n\n63\n00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.428\nAnd is it a public group?\n\n64\n00:03:13.428 --> 00:03:17.020\nSo that's for the folder itself.\n\n65\n00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.970\nAnd then you can see the ones\nthat Salesforce gives you.\n\n66\n00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.390\nSo you have Unfiled Public Reports\nthat everyone has access to seeing.\n\n67\n00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.390\nThen you have my Personal Custom Reports\nthat are only I can see these reports, and\n\n68\n00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.630\nsame with dashboards.\n\n69\n00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.932\nAnd we'll get into that in a minute.\n\n70\n00:03:30.932 --> 00:03:36.640\nBut you have them broken down by objects,\nand then the report itself.\n\n71\n00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.130\nSo let's start with a real general\nreport for an accounting contact,\n\n72\n00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.270\nsince we're here.\n\n73\n00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.840\nSo let's go over into Active Accounts.\n\n74\n00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.480\nWhat are my current accounts?\n\n75\n00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.810\nAnd you can see how\nthe descriptive is helpful.\n\n76\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.440\nYou can see what folder it's placed on.\n\n77\n00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.050\nYou can see if there's\na schedule running on it.\n\n78\n00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.725\nAnd you can sort in who the created by is.\n\n79\n00:03:55.725 --> 00:03:58.026\nSo I'm gonna select into active accounts,\n\n80\n00:03:58.026 --> 00:04:01.130\nand now we're gonna be\nin our report builder.\n\n81\n00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.730\nSo from here, a lot of this,\nit's drag and drop, point, click.\n\n82\n00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.472\nSo, to our left,\nyou have a list of all your fields.\n\n83\n00:04:08.472 --> 00:04:10.496\nSo we selected the object as a count.\n\n84\n00:04:10.496 --> 00:04:14.920\nYou're only gonna see a count\nfield at this point here.\n\n85\n00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.655\nSo if I scroll down, you can see how\nthey've broken down all of the standard\n\n86\n00:04:20.655 --> 00:04:25.455\nand custom fields which populate here if\nyou created any custom fields before.\n\n87\n00:04:25.455 --> 00:04:28.885\nAnd then, broken down into\nthe sections by the phone type, or\n\n88\n00:04:28.885 --> 00:04:32.265\ncustom info will live at the very end,\nup here.\n\n89\n00:04:32.265 --> 00:04:36.430\nSo with this example,\nwe can just see the account owner,\n\n90\n00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.930\naccount name, billing type, rating.\n\n91\n00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.204\nRight here in this preview we're\nonly looking at a tabular format.\n\n92\n00:04:43.204 --> 00:04:48.250\nNow this is a great introduction\nto different report types.\n\n93\n00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.100\nSo what are the different\nreport types you can have or\n\n94\n00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.660\nbuild on the Salesforce environment?\n\n95\n00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.395\nYou can have tabular, summary,\na matrix report, and a joined report.\n\n96\n00:04:59.395 --> 00:05:02.909\nA tabular is just gonna show\nyou record details going down.\n\n97\n00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:08.780\nYou can't yet summarize from it and\nyou can't generate a chart from it.\n\n98\n00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.777\nSo you can only generate that\nonce you're at the summary level.\n\n99\n00:05:12.777 --> 00:05:16.387\nSo in a summary format,\nyou can start adding charts and\n\n100\n00:05:16.387 --> 00:05:18.800\nyou can summarize your data.\n\n101\n00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.060\nYou can group your data.\n\n102\n00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.271\nIt's probably the most used.\n\n103\n00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:27.560\nAnd then you have to summarize both up and\ndown and left to right.\n\n104\n00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.000\nYou can also summarize with a matrix\nreport, and pull in more data, here.\n\n105\n00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.660\nAnd bring in formula fields,\nat this point.\n\n106\n00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.830\nAnd then you have a joined report\nwhere you can pull in, right here,\n\n107\n00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.420\ndifferent data side by side.\n\n108\n00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.440\nAnd group out those different\nblocks into your joint reports.\n\n109\n00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.470\nSo, a lot of options you have available.\n\n110\n00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.930\nWe're gonna go ahead, out of the box,\nby default, you start with tabular.\n\n111\n00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.610\nLet's go through and let's start sorting\nout my data by a pick list, by type.\n\n112\n00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.070\nSo, I'm gonna change in order to do that.\n\n113\n00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.780\nRight now,\nI can only pull in fields to the side.\n\n114\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.068\nSo, if I wanted to bring over rating.\n\n115\n00:06:04.068 --> 00:06:08.681\nAnd you can see, I'm just gonna\ndrag it over into the area or\n\n116\n00:06:08.681 --> 00:06:11.462\nthe column that I want it to go into.\n\n117\n00:06:11.462 --> 00:06:17.801\nAnd anything I see fit,\nthat might be helpful to have.\n\n118\n00:06:17.801 --> 00:06:22.454\nAnd maybe it's not important for me to\nhave, at this point, the billing state.\n\n119\n00:06:22.454 --> 00:06:25.078\nThere are no requirements\nat this point here.\n\n120\n00:06:25.078 --> 00:06:27.600\nIt's just, what information do\nI need to see at this point?\n\n121\n00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.092\nThere's not a whole lot of data.\n\n122\n00:06:31.092 --> 00:06:35.250\nSo we've looked at what's across here\nto your left, what's at the bottom.\n\n123\n00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.160\nIt's also important to note the filters,\nwhere you're at.\n\n124\n00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.130\nWhat data are you looking at right now?\n\n125\n00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.200\nSo right now we're just in a preview mode.\n\n126\n00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.055\nIf we're talking thousands of records,\n\n127\n00:06:44.055 --> 00:06:46.205\nyou're not gonna have\nall of that populate.\n\n128\n00:06:46.205 --> 00:06:48.655\nA good amount of records will show here,\n\n129\n00:06:48.655 --> 00:06:51.135\nso you can make sure you're\npulling in the right data.\n\n130\n00:06:51.135 --> 00:06:54.185\nBut right now, only one record is pulling.\n\n131\n00:06:54.185 --> 00:06:57.131\nSo let's look at all accounts.\n\n132\n00:06:57.131 --> 00:07:00.970\nAnd right now, it's looking at\nall accounts, or it was looking\n\n133\n00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.963\nat my accounts with the last activity from\nthis date till now because this is blank.\n\n134\n00:07:05.963 --> 00:07:09.245\nBut let's just start with create a date.\n\n135\n00:07:09.245 --> 00:07:14.287\nAnd I'm gonna hit All Time, so we can\nsee more active data and accurate data.\n\n136\n00:07:14.287 --> 00:07:17.244\nSo, right now this is telling me,\nthese are my filters so\n\n137\n00:07:17.244 --> 00:07:19.350\nI have the option to look at my accounts.\n\n138\n00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:24.105\nI'm system admin, so\nI have more options here to see what\n\n139\n00:07:24.105 --> 00:07:28.080\naccess I can have or\ncreate for other end users.\n\n140\n00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:33.031\nSo is it also gonna be a team accounts,\nif that was set up, my accounts,\n\n141\n00:07:33.031 --> 00:07:36.014\nand then my account teams and my accounts.\n\n142\n00:07:36.014 --> 00:07:40.760\nThese are your five different\noptions that you have here.\n\n143\n00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.480\nSo, right now,\nI'm just selecting all accounts.\n\n144\n00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.922\nAnd per tabular, I can't degroup\nanything at this point, yet.\n\n145\n00:07:46.922 --> 00:07:50.674\nSo, I wanna be able to summarize,\nand let's see if we have,\n\n146\n00:07:50.674 --> 00:07:54.148\nwe can do that with an opportunity and\norder summarize.\n\n147\n00:07:54.148 --> 00:07:57.730\nYou want a currency field to\nbe able to pull a number, but\n\n148\n00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.399\nlet's change it over into a summary, And\n\n149\n00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:05.200\nI want to be able to summarize by my\ndifferent types of accounts, so all I'm\n\n150\n00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.261\ngonna do is I'm gonna take that field and\nmove it over here into this grouping.\n\n151\n00:08:10.261 --> 00:08:14.830\nSo it's gonna take it and\ngroup it by the customer types.\n\n152\n00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.569\nNow you can throw in another\ngrouping if you wanted, but\n\n153\n00:08:17.569 --> 00:08:20.845\nyou can start seeing the build-out\ngenerating a report.\n\n154\n00:08:20.845 --> 00:08:24.361\nNow if you want to add a chart,\nI'm gonna select Add a chart.\n\n155\n00:08:24.361 --> 00:08:28.130\nSo I have the option of showing these\ndifferent types of charts they want.\n\n156\n00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:32.590\nSo if I want a horizontal or\na vertical bar or\n\n157\n00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:37.075\nin an opportunity I want a funnel or\na pipeline for a pipeline report.\n\n158\n00:08:37.075 --> 00:08:38.495\nThese are your different options here.\n\n159\n00:08:38.495 --> 00:08:39.455\nBut in that type,\n\n160\n00:08:40.685 --> 00:08:45.665\nmaybe I just wanna see what's the largest\nlist in my different account types here.\n\n161\n00:08:45.665 --> 00:08:51.440\nAnd sometimes when the value in\nthat pic list is too large or\n\n162\n00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.068\nif there's records without\nthat value they'll sit here.\n\n163\n00:08:54.068 --> 00:08:57.260\nSo you may wanna start thinking of\nwhat's gonna be the best way to see and\n\n164\n00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.240\nvisualize this data here.\n\n165\n00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.510\nSo it's just for visual purposes.\n\n166\n00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.320\nRight now we're looking at the y-axis,\nthe record count.\n\n167\n00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.180\nIf there were more values or\n\n168\n00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:11.270\nmore groupings you can be more\nspecific and add additional groupings.\n\n169\n00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.830\nAnd you can plot additional values\nif there was more to work with,\n\n170\n00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:18.120\nbut right now we just pulled a few field.\n\n171\n00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.320\nAnd then you go into your formatting and\n\n172\n00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.640\nthis is where you change more of\nthe textile and the font size and\n\n173\n00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.400\nwhere things should be positioned\nwithin the chart itself.\n\n174\n00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:33.280\nSo legend position, you want to\nshow the values and enable hover.\n\n175\n00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:37.933\nWhat's your position of the chart, is it\nabove the report or below the report,\n\n176\n00:09:37.933 --> 00:09:40.094\nis it extra large or small or medium?\n\n177\n00:09:40.094 --> 00:09:44.927\nSo these are some of your options that you\nhave here, just to kind of stylize and\n\n178\n00:09:44.927 --> 00:09:47.208\nvisualize how this is going to look.\n\n179\n00:09:47.208 --> 00:09:49.635\nLet me zoom out so you can hit OK.\n\n180\n00:09:51.754 --> 00:09:55.310\nAnd so at this point we're\nstill just setting things up.\n\n181\n00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:59.840\nWe've selected our filters, we see\nthe fields that we have to choose from.\n\n182\n00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.368\nIf you working with an object\nthat has over a hundred fields,\n\n183\n00:10:03.368 --> 00:10:06.360\nyou can quick find by the field name or\n\n184\n00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:12.900\nyou can also search by different\nfolders in different types of fields.\n\n185\n00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.627\nAnd once I Select All,\nyou can see I can also bring in\n\n186\n00:10:16.627 --> 00:10:20.635\nthe formulas into my fields and\ncreate bucket fields.\n\n187\n00:10:22.643 --> 00:10:25.598\nSo, for this one I'm just gonna\ngo ahead and run the report.\n\n188\n00:10:28.396 --> 00:10:32.093\nSo, now all of my data that\nfits this criteria that\n\n189\n00:10:32.093 --> 00:10:36.250\nI gave will now fall under and\nbe broken down in this way.\n\n190\n00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:42.625\nSo you can see the report chart and\nthen you can see all the data beneath it.\n\n191\n00:10:42.625 --> 00:10:47.489\nAnd so if I wanted to capture more data\nthen I would just pull in all the columns\n\n192\n00:10:47.489 --> 00:10:49.240\nthat were relevent to see.\n\n193\n00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.330\nSo we're seeing it in the order that we\nwere creating it in and building it out.\n\n194\n00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.600\nAnd if there was a summary amount,\n\n195\n00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.820\nyou would see that at the very\nbottom here, in a summary report.\n\n196\n00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:04.581\nAnd then you can drill down even further\nby some of these fields that you have\n\n197\n00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:05.723\navailable here.\n\n198\n00:11:05.723 --> 00:11:09.047\nSo it's a great visual representation,\nbut there's also\n\n199\n00:11:09.047 --> 00:11:13.379\na lot of other great features you can do\nonce you build and create this report.\n\n200\n00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:17.130\nSo you can Run Report Now.\n\n201\n00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.110\nSo this is we'll just\ncall it our all accounts.\n\n202\n00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:22.600\nIt's running the report now.\n\n203\n00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.617\nOr you can Schedule Future Runs,\nwhich is a a great feature that have,\n\n204\n00:11:26.617 --> 00:11:29.014\nlet's call it the Accounts List Report.\n\n205\n00:11:29.014 --> 00:11:31.629\nAnd we're gonna save and\ncontinue to schedule.\n\n206\n00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:36.629\nSo your reports can be ran on\na weekly basis, monthly basis,\n\n207\n00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:41.150\nyou determine that, and\nyou say who sees this report.\n\n208\n00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:45.481\nSo maybe there's a sales report that\nyou create that schedules and runs and\n\n209\n00:11:45.481 --> 00:11:48.917\nsends to all your sales users and\nsales managers at the end of\n\n210\n00:11:48.917 --> 00:11:53.020\nevery month who are at the beginning\nof and start of the week.\n\n211\n00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.763\nYou set that criteria,\n\n212\n00:11:54.763 --> 00:11:59.130\neveryone will get an email if\nyou select to me and to others.\n\n213\n00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:02.760\nAnd you can select it off the groups or\nthe users themselves.\n\n214\n00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.604\nSo as I select, if you had more users\nyou'll be able to send an email\n\n215\n00:12:07.604 --> 00:12:12.203\ncould've add and remove and\nselect who has access to see this.\n\n216\n00:12:12.203 --> 00:12:15.649\nSo I'm gonna go back into\nthe report itself, and\n\n217\n00:12:15.649 --> 00:12:18.600\nkeep in mind too, I have yet to save this.\n\n218\n00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.401\nSo if I were to navigate away from this,\nit has not been saved.\n\n219\n00:12:22.401 --> 00:12:28.620\nIt is only moved over from\nthe Report Builder over to this page here.\n\n220\n00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.460\nSo you have to save it first.\n\n221\n00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:35.620\nIn this case, I'm gonna Save As and\nI'm gonna name it Accounts.\n\n222\n00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:41.470\nBecause remember we were editing from\nan existing report that Salesforce had.\n\n223\n00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:45.153\nSo, what report folder\nyou want it to sit in.\n\n224\n00:12:45.153 --> 00:12:48.978\nWe've already started and\nwe created the report folder so\n\n225\n00:12:48.978 --> 00:12:51.717\nI'm gonna place it in my org folder here.\n\n226\n00:12:51.717 --> 00:12:54.233\nAnd I'm gonna save and\nreturn to the report.\n\n227\n00:12:54.233 --> 00:12:59.759\nSo we have this custom built\nexample of a summary-type report.\n\n228\n00:12:59.759 --> 00:13:04.867\nIf we go back into my list of reports,\nyou'll see pinned at the very\n\n229\n00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:09.627\ntop is this folder here, and\nthe report that we just created.\n\n230\n00:13:09.627 --> 00:13:13.843\nSo next I wanna get into\ncustom report types.\n\n231\n00:13:13.843 --> 00:13:18.548\nSo we created this and edited this from\nan existing pre-built out report, but\n\n232\n00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:21.413\nwhat about when we're\nstarting from scratch?\n\n233\n00:13:21.413 --> 00:13:23.585\nSo I'm gonna select New Report.\n\n234\n00:13:25.881 --> 00:13:29.540\nAnd let's do Opportunities,\ncuz we'll get a summary there.\n\n235\n00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:37.540\nHit Create, and right now these are just\ngoing to give me these fields here.\n\n236\n00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.670\nLet's say it's not important\nto have my next step, and\n\n237\n00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:47.630\nI just want to show you a summary\nof the switch at first.\n\n238\n00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.378\nSo by default it will say a tabular.\n\n239\n00:13:49.378 --> 00:13:53.357\nI'm gonna hit Summary, and\nnow you want to select this button here,\n\n240\n00:13:53.357 --> 00:13:54.944\nand summarize this field.\n\n241\n00:13:54.944 --> 00:13:59.198\nSo, you have the option of\ngrouping it from here, or\n\n242\n00:13:59.198 --> 00:14:05.292\nwe can select to move the amount,\nchange it right here, the amount field,\n\n243\n00:14:05.292 --> 00:14:11.116\nand you can move it over there, or\nif you want to remove it, let's see.\n\n244\n00:14:15.853 --> 00:14:18.273\nRemove the group.\n\n245\n00:14:18.273 --> 00:14:22.839\nCuz I want to summarize it, not group it,\nI want to group it by the type, so\n\n246\n00:14:22.839 --> 00:14:24.848\nI'm gonna drag that over here.\n\n247\n00:14:24.848 --> 00:14:27.475\nAnd then find my amount field.\n\n248\n00:14:32.745 --> 00:14:36.324\nAnd if I lost it and I search for it.\n\n249\n00:14:36.324 --> 00:14:39.954\nAnd I'm just gonna take that and\ndrop it right where I need it, and\n\n250\n00:14:39.954 --> 00:14:41.490\nI'm gonna select this.\n\n251\n00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:45.287\nAnd I then I have the option to bucket\nthis field or summarize this field.\n\n252\n00:14:45.287 --> 00:14:49.141\nGroup the field is what we saw,\nyou had the options to summarize it,\n\n253\n00:14:49.141 --> 00:14:53.780\nget the average, the maximum, or\nthe minimum number, and hit Apply.\n\n254\n00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:57.562\nAnd now when we run this report,\nthis is looking at all opportunities.\n\n255\n00:14:57.562 --> 00:14:58.808\nThis is the criteria.\n\n256\n00:15:01.796 --> 00:15:05.522\nYou'll be able to see the breakdown and\nby each type for\n\n257\n00:15:05.522 --> 00:15:08.688\nexisting customers this\nis your number here.\n\n258\n00:15:08.688 --> 00:15:12.626\nSo it's really easy to kinda build\nout these reports and run them, but\n\n259\n00:15:12.626 --> 00:15:15.690\nfrom this page here,\nwhat other options you have?\n\n260\n00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:19.512\nSo you can email the report,\nyou can hide the details.\n\n261\n00:15:19.512 --> 00:15:23.217\nYou can make further customizations, but\nyou can also have it printed out and\n\n262\n00:15:23.217 --> 00:15:23.791\nexport it.\n\n263\n00:15:23.791 --> 00:15:27.667\nSo if I select a printable view it's\ngonna pull it up in this file and\n\n264\n00:15:27.667 --> 00:15:30.990\nyou're able to print off of it and\nthen same with export,\n\n265\n00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:34.339\nyou can have your files exported\ninto Excel or a CSV file.\n\n266\n00:15:34.339 --> 00:15:36.280\nSo that's a question I often see.\n\n267\n00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.600\nWhat can you do with the report?\n\n268\n00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.690\nCan you print it out?\n\n269\n00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:40.650\nCan you export it?\n\n270\n00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.330\nWhat are the file types you can export as?\n\n271\n00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.929\nSo those are your options there for\nreporting.\n\n272\n00:15:46.929 --> 00:15:52.077\nNow Dashboards, a dashboard is,\nlet's get into one first,\n\n273\n00:15:52.077 --> 00:15:57.324\nto show you is a live representation\nof your up to 20 reports,\n\n274\n00:15:57.324 --> 00:16:05.378\nso when we select New Dashboard I'm\ngonna select, Show Me Later.\n\n275\n00:16:05.378 --> 00:16:08.940\nSo you can pull in up to\n20 reports onto this field.\n\n276\n00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:11.680\nAnd there's a drag and drop interface too.\n\n277\n00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.580\nSo we're gonna select, Data Sources.\n\n278\n00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:19.650\nCuz we don't have component, cuz we don't\nhave a source to drag a component onto.\n\n279\n00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:21.250\nSo I'm gonna select my data source.\n\n280\n00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.680\nAnd I'm gonna select, Reports.\n\n281\n00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.790\nAnd I'm looking for the file and\nthis is the one we just created.\n\n282\n00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.019\nSo I'm gonna drag and drop that over here.\n\n283\n00:16:30.019 --> 00:16:33.842\nNow, when you start moving over 10s, 15,\n\n284\n00:16:33.842 --> 00:16:40.000\n20 reports into this in order for\nit to save, it has to have a component.\n\n285\n00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.680\nNow if we've already pre-built these out,\n\n286\n00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.220\nwe've already added a chart to\nthe report like we did previously.\n\n287\n00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.330\nIt's kind of tedious to do it again and\ndo all the set up.\n\n288\n00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:53.350\nSo if you select the wrench, rather than\nhaving to redo it at the report level,\n\n289\n00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:56.030\njust select Use Chart as\nDefined in the Source Report,\n\n290\n00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.550\nand it's gonna pull it from the report,\nitself.\n\n291\n00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.450\nAnd this is what we created.\n\n292\n00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:03.220\nSo when you're looking at\na dashboard of 20 different reports,\n\n293\n00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.520\nyou wanna have a title.\n\n294\n00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.630\nYou can have a header.\n\n295\n00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:11.855\nAnd so\nlet's just name this active accounts.\n\n296\n00:17:11.855 --> 00:17:16.015\nAnd so you can play with what Salesforce\ngives you here, what's the source.\n\n297\n00:17:16.015 --> 00:17:18.355\nAnd then, the dashboard properties.\n\n298\n00:17:18.355 --> 00:17:22.485\nSo you can have what's called\na dynamic dashboard and Salesforce.\n\n299\n00:17:22.485 --> 00:17:24.281\nAnd this is something\nI do see on the quiz.\n\n300\n00:17:24.281 --> 00:17:26.365\nWhat does a dynamic dashboard do?\n\n301\n00:17:26.365 --> 00:17:31.290\nThat can make it tailored to, right now\nwe're looking at active accounts for\n\n302\n00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:35.152\neveryone but when you want a user\nto be logged in as herself and\n\n303\n00:17:35.152 --> 00:17:40.459\nonly see information that's relevant to\nthem whether they're active accounts,\n\n304\n00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:45.510\nwhat is that user's active\nopportunities or closed opportunities?\n\n305\n00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.350\nNow for the org as a whole, but\n\n306\n00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.460\nas an individual, you wanna create\nwhat's called the Dynamic Dashboard.\n\n307\n00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.928\nSo your dashboard has to have a title.\n\n308\n00:17:56.328 --> 00:18:00.216\nAnd in my personal dashboard,\nand went over the settings here,\n\n309\n00:18:00.216 --> 00:18:02.430\ncomponent settings.\n\n310\n00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:06.380\nSo, we're gonna hit OK, and\nnow we have this saved.\n\n311\n00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:10.200\nWe have the dashboard properties saved,\nthe components in here, the fields.\n\n312\n00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.740\nAnd who are we viewing this dashboard as?\n\n313\n00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.280\nRight now myself.\n\n314\n00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.150\nSo if we wanted to make this dynamic,\ngo to the far right and\n\n315\n00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:21.100\nselect Run As Locked In Users.\n\n316\n00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:26.070\nIf you want to give them the authorization\nto change the running user, you can.\n\n317\n00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.730\nBut, if not, just select OK.\n\n318\n00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:33.539\nAnd then the details and the reports that\nshow up here that you've already built\n\n319\n00:18:33.539 --> 00:18:35.635\nwill run based off the login user.\n\n320\n00:18:37.797 --> 00:18:41.048\nSo to navigate back to your homepage,\nwe went through reports,\n\n321\n00:18:41.048 --> 00:18:44.483\nwhat you can do with the report,\nwhat you can do with the dashboard,\n\n322\n00:18:44.483 --> 00:18:47.250\nhow to build off those visual charts.\n\n323\n00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:51.180\nAnother topic I want to go into is,\nwe've gone through folder management.\n\n324\n00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:55.040\nBut some other types of content you\ncan have within Salesforce course.\n\n325\n00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.160\nSo this covers for\na small percentage within the,\n\n326\n00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:04.740\nso we're going to surf for\ncontent within the exam itself.\n\n327\n00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.430\nSo within Salesforce you have\nwhats called content deliveries.\n\n328\n00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:11.200\nSo you can have a file\nstored within Salesforce.\n\n329\n00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.210\nYou know PDF files stored as\nattachments within records, but\n\n330\n00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.220\nthey need to be\nMicrosoft Word PowerPoints, but\n\n331\n00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.640\nthey need to be stored in a certain\nformat as you're sending out emails.\n\n332\n00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.750\nSo this is something that you can\nenable for content deliveries.\n\n333\n00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:27.890\nWhether you want password protection.\n\n334\n00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.750\nIf it's something that\nshould be optional or\n\n335\n00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.880\nif there should be a default setting here.\n\n336\n00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.580\nSo these are just changes that you\ncan make as you're sending out, and\n\n337\n00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.830\nyou're sending out more secure\ninformation via the web.\n\n338\n00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.510\nSo, that's content deliveries, and\n\n339\n00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:45.570\nthen another piece that I want\nto go over would be tags.\n\n340\n00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:51.200\nSo, within Salesforce or orgs that\nare moving away from other system.\n\n341\n00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.140\nI see a lot of requests for,\nhey I have tags within my other system and\n\n342\n00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.410\nwhat does that look like in Salesforce or\nyou know,\n\n343\n00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:01.780\nI run my whole entire business off tags,\nwhat do I do now?\n\n344\n00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.930\nSo as an alternative you\ncreate those fields and\n\n345\n00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:09.680\nyou start generating these reports\nto kind of work with those tags.\n\n346\n00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:14.660\nSo if it was, the tag was sent\nsample from the other database\n\n347\n00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.431\nyou can see a list of all accounts that\nyou sent the sample to but instead,\n\n348\n00:20:18.431 --> 00:20:23.080\nin Salesforce you would have\nan opportunity with maybe a check box\n\n349\n00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.640\nsent that said sample, and a report\nthat you create that generates a list of\n\n350\n00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.500\nall accounts you've sent samples\nto in a given time period.\n\n351\n00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.470\nThat's jut an example of how you're\nmoving away from one system to the next,\n\n352\n00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:40.500\nfrom tags related to custom\nfields in a report instead.\n\n353\n00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:45.430\nBut if you do still wanna enable tags you\ncan, but sometimes I've seen orgs where\n\n354\n00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:50.970\nthey just have one too many where it's\nprobably better to utilize a custom field.\n\n355\n00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:55.490\nSo this is something you have to enable,\nso I'm gonna go over to Tag Settings.\n\n356\n00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:02.780\nAnd I wanna give it a sec and\nI enable personal tags.\n\n357\n00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.820\nAnd you see here you have the option of\nwhere you want it enable personal tag,\n\n358\n00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.568\nit is reports, documents,\nnotes, dashboards,\n\n359\n00:21:09.568 --> 00:21:14.480\nwhat layouts and these are available.\n\n360\n00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:18.530\nI'm just gonna pull it all in and we\ncreated a property custom object earlier\n\n361\n00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.080\nso all your custom objects\nhave that same option.\n\n362\n00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.900\nAnd I'm gonna hit Save.\n\n363\n00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.040\nAnd now we can go into accounts.\n\n364\n00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.710\nAnd you'll be able to have\nthe option as you bring it through,\n\n365\n00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.210\nadding different tags here, users.\n\n366\n00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:38.860\nI'm sorry, to the records itself.\n\n367\n00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.540\nAnd being able to kind of\nsort through those tags here.\n\n368\n00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:45.050\nSo at the very top,\nright above your feed, and this is for\n\n369\n00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.850\nany record you can add a tag.\n\n370\n00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.750\nProspect, Save.\n\n371\n00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:53.260\nAnd you can do the comma.\n\n372\n00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.360\nNow you'll see it's saved under here.\n\n373\n00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:01.360\nSeparate from a list view, you can go\nin and remove the records from those\n\n374\n00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:07.520\ncertain tags, and so that's to show you\nhow to enable tags within Salesforce.\n\n375\n00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.930\n&gt;&gt; All right Felicia, again another great\nlook at what we can do with Salesforce.\n\n376\n00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:14.930\nIn this case really taking a look at\nhow we can use the analytics built into\n\n377\n00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:19.010\nSalesforce to really work with and\nmanipulate and view our data.\n\n378\n00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:22.710\nAnd wow, how about creating those reports,\nno formulas to create.\n\n379\n00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.380\nI mean you can if you want, right?\n\n380\n00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.860\nBut you can also do drag and drop and\nit calculates everything for you.\n\n381\n00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.170\nGrouping summaries, fantastic stuff.\n\n382\n00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:33.850\nSo we hope everybody out there\nappreciated this one and enjoyed it.\n\n383\n00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:37.360\nFor now signing off for IT Pro TV I've\nbeen your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n384\n00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:38.340\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Felicia Doherty.\n\n385\n00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.189\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n386\n00:22:40.189 --> 00:22:46.215\n[MUSIC]\n\n387\n00:22:46.215 --> 00:22:51.799\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.864 --> 00:00:15.380\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.360\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.180\nToday we're doing our\nSalesforce Certified Administrator.\n\n7\n00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.230\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\ntaking a look at how we can do workflow\n\n8\n00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.120\nautomation.\n\n9\n00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.930\nAnd here to help us with that,\nis Miss Felicia Duarte.\n\n10\n00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.114\nWelcome back, Felicia.\n\n11\n00:00:29.114 --> 00:00:30.282\n&gt;&gt; Great, thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:30.282 --> 00:00:34.030\nSo, I'm gonna cover one of my\nfavorite topics, workflow automation.\n\n13\n00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.450\nSo, this accounts for 9% of questions\nwithin the sales force exam.\n\n14\n00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.030\nSo, what is the workflow,\nwhat can I do, what's covered.\n\n15\n00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.450\nEveryone's aware that there's a new\nprocess called the process builder.\n\n16\n00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.540\nAs of today,\nthat's not included in the exam itself so\n\n17\n00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.880\nwe're just gonna cover\nworkflow automation.\n\n18\n00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.795\nWhat kind of workflow do, what are some\nkind of workflows, what are the criterias?\n\n19\n00:00:57.795 --> 00:01:02.015\nAnd go through a demo of\ncreating one ourselves.\n\n20\n00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:05.234\nSo, I'm gonna jump in and\ngive some examples of different types and\n\n21\n00:01:05.234 --> 00:01:08.095\nwhat you can do with the workflow\nfrom the setup options.\n\n22\n00:01:08.095 --> 00:01:14.535\nSo, for one a workflow you can do\nyou can create, do a field update.\n\n23\n00:01:14.535 --> 00:01:18.020\nSo, let me log into the workflow\nitself I'm going to workflow rules.\n\n24\n00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.130\nAnd another goal that I like to mention,\nis we'll also go through approvals.\n\n25\n00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.460\nSo, we're gonna discuss workflows and\napprovals.\n\n26\n00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.240\nSo, what can a workflow do?\n\n27\n00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.400\nYou can create a task,\nupdate a field, send an email, or\n\n28\n00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.180\nsend an outbound message based off\nthe criteria that you give it.\n\n29\n00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.250\nSo, this is one of the neat features\nthat Salesforce has in making\n\n30\n00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.420\nmost of your business process, automated.\n\n31\n00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.060\nAnd you can make it as automated\nas you want with workflow rules,\n\n32\n00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.000\nbased off this criteria\nwithout jumping into code.\n\n33\n00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.720\nSo with clicks not code.\n\n34\n00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.086\nSo, we're gonna go through and\n\n35\n00:01:51.086 --> 00:01:54.131\nhere's some examples that Salesforce\ngives you from the homepage.\n\n36\n00:01:54.131 --> 00:01:57.690\nYou can opt out not to see it again,\nwhat's you get comfortable.\n\n37\n00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.100\nBut, if you're still kind of learning\nit this is great to have as a start.\n\n38\n00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.850\nSo, I'm gonna hit continue.\n\n39\n00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.860\nAnd now, right now, this will show\na list of all your workflow rules.\n\n40\n00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.010\nI've had to set up for\norg 75 workflow rules before.\n\n41\n00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.290\nSo, you really want to make\nsure you're descriptive.\n\n42\n00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.660\nI can't express enough how descriptive\nyou are with your workflow rules.\n\n43\n00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.040\nBecause as you're trying to go through and\n\n44\n00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.070\ntroubleshoot workflow rules\nthat aren't working or that.\n\n45\n00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.980\nAre inactive or you need to see what we're\ncloser encountering against each other,\n\n46\n00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.110\nyou wanna be able to define with\nits description what it is doing,\n\n47\n00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.320\nwhat's the criteria.\n\n48\n00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.950\nSo right here, Salesforce will not\ngive you any workflows out the back,\n\n49\n00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.900\nout the blocks, so\nto automate this process more,\n\n50\n00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.400\nyou wanna go into the workflow section.\n\n51\n00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.480\nNow, I created this one as an example,\njust to show you but it is inactive.\n\n52\n00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.140\nSo, when you go to create a new rule.\n\n53\n00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.990\nWe'll use that one as an example\nwalk through it together.\n\n54\n00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.930\nYou have to select the object\nfrom what you're working from.\n\n55\n00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.820\nSo, we'll use opportunities as an example.\n\n56\n00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.730\nSome common ones are maybe I wanna\nreach out to my contacts, or\n\n57\n00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.920\nsend them a birthday email\nevery time it's their birthday.\n\n58\n00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.505\nYou first need to make\nsure that field exists.\n\n59\n00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:13.580\nYou need to make sure\nit's in the right format.\n\n60\n00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.780\nSo, opportunities a common one they\nsee is changing the opportunity name.\n\n61\n00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.360\nSo, if there is a certain default\ncriteria that you want your\n\n62\n00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.690\nopportunity to look like.\n\n63\n00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.100\nMaybe it's the opportunity\nplus an auto number or\n\n64\n00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.910\nplus something that, a product field.\n\n65\n00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.450\nYou kinda set that, set that up for\nyour clients and make things automated.\n\n66\n00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.520\nAnd you can also place\nyour contacts in certain\n\n67\n00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.800\nbuckets if they are orphan contacts.\n\n68\n00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.990\nLike an individual account record.\n\n69\n00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.020\nBut we're gonna start,\nwe have to give it a rule name.\n\n70\n00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.160\nSo, what is this rule name?\n\n71\n00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.580\nUsing one of my examples,\nI'm going to go with opportunity name.\n\n72\n00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.530\nWhen an opportunity is created.\n\n73\n00:03:56.062 --> 00:04:01.542\nUpdate, The opportunity name.\n\n74\n00:04:03.873 --> 00:04:06.480\nSo, evaluation criteria.\n\n75\n00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.740\nWhen do you want this\nrule to be evaluated?\n\n76\n00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.680\nIs it only at the point that\nthis record is created?\n\n77\n00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.334\nBecause if you select created it will only\nevaluate it at that point that the records\n\n78\n00:04:17.334 --> 00:04:23.012\nhave been created, whether its through an\nimport or a manual creation of a record.\n\n79\n00:04:23.012 --> 00:04:27.461\nBut if and so when we look at it again if\nit's edited, but if you wanna look at it\n\n80\n00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:32.185\nevery single time it's edited, you'll\nselect a middle one, and with this one,\n\n81\n00:04:32.185 --> 00:04:35.960\nyou can add time dependent\nworkflow actions with this option.\n\n82\n00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.780\nBut, if you wanna to be only evaluated\nevery time it meets the criteria,\n\n83\n00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.410\nthen you select the last one.\n\n84\n00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.570\nRight now, we're gonna go with this\none that every time it's edited,\n\n85\n00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.690\nI want the recorded to be evaluated.\n\n86\n00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.430\nIn this example,\nusually I go with this one, but\n\n87\n00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.320\nin this example its only gonna look at\nit when the opportunity is created.\n\n88\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.690\nSo, this maybe the better fit here.\n\n89\n00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.909\nBut test out your workflows, I can't\nstress this enough if you're working with\n\n90\n00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:06.045\nan existing environment,\nwork in a sandbox environment.\n\n91\n00:05:06.045 --> 00:05:10.523\nBecause when you're doing email\nalerts with existing data,\n\n92\n00:05:10.523 --> 00:05:15.531\nyou're affecting your users and\nyou're affecting your contacts.\n\n93\n00:05:15.531 --> 00:05:17.935\nAnd you don't wanna work\nin a live environment.\n\n94\n00:05:17.935 --> 00:05:19.685\nSo, what's your criteria?\n\n95\n00:05:19.685 --> 00:05:23.105\nSo, is this run this rule if\nthe following criteria is met or\n\n96\n00:05:23.105 --> 00:05:25.455\nif it's a formula to\nevaluate it to be true?\n\n97\n00:05:25.455 --> 00:05:29.070\nSo, right now, let's just with\nthe created date, keep it real simple.\n\n98\n00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.370\nSo, created date,\nI'm gonna use greater than or equal to,\n\n99\n00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.910\nand just use a real\nsimple formula of today.\n\n100\n00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.560\nAnd you can do date ranges,\n\n101\n00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.740\nyou can go based off any field\nyou have in sales force.\n\n102\n00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.740\nSo, I'm gonna hit save and next, And\nanother thing I didn't touch base on,\n\n103\n00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.750\nI'm gonna take a step back as I saw\nas I was saving, is the filter logic.\n\n104\n00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.480\nSo, if you added more criteria\nonto the filter logic and\n\n105\n00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.082\nyou needed to have in this example.\n\n106\n00:06:00.082 --> 00:06:05.249\nI wanna do in a filter based off, the\namount that's greater than a million and\n\n107\n00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:10.178\nthe close date is equal to next 45 days\nand the owner role starts with VP,\n\n108\n00:06:10.178 --> 00:06:12.104\nthen you can select, is it.\n\n109\n00:06:12.104 --> 00:06:15.586\nIt has to be the amount greater\nthan with that 1 million and\n\n110\n00:06:15.586 --> 00:06:19.020\nthe close it has to be\nover the next 45 days.\n\n111\n00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.710\nOr is it the third option,\nas long as the owner is a VP.\n\n112\n00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.217\nSo, you have the options of\nsetting that logic here, and\n\n113\n00:06:27.217 --> 00:06:29.130\nfollowing this example here.\n\n114\n00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.522\nThe 1 and 2 or 3 and kind of pick\nthat up if you have more criteria.\n\n115\n00:06:32.522 --> 00:06:36.983\nSo, save and next, and\nthen we have, I think,\n\n116\n00:06:36.983 --> 00:06:42.910\nbecause I hit the back button,\nit didn't save anything I did.\n\n117\n00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.978\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, let's start over here, and\n\n118\n00:06:45.978 --> 00:06:48.888\ndo opportunity name, gonna keep it fast.\n\n119\n00:06:48.888 --> 00:06:50.980\nAnd, my description.\n\n120\n00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.764\nOkay.\n\n121\n00:07:13.067 --> 00:07:15.070\nSo, you have to have\nat least one criteria.\n\n122\n00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.320\nAnd I've already created this.\n\n123\n00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.508\nThe rule name has to be unique.\n\n124\n00:07:20.508 --> 00:07:22.290\nSo, I'm just gonna add a two there.\n\n125\n00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:29.000\nAnd then, may have spelled opportunity\nwrong, but we'll carry on there.\n\n126\n00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.640\nAnd then, what is the action?\n\n127\n00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.270\nSo, what I'm saying here is,\n\n128\n00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.308\nonce this opportunity is created right\nnow I'm saying greater than today.\n\n129\n00:07:36.308 --> 00:07:38.970\nSo, today or great than this date,\nwhat do you want it to do?\n\n130\n00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.800\nAnd you can have several\nactions tied to it.\n\n131\n00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.100\nSo, you can have it update a field.\n\n132\n00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.640\nYou can have it generate a task.\n\n133\n00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.640\nYou can have it to all sorta things and\n\n134\n00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.550\nyou can have it based off it time\ndependent workflow action here.\n\n135\n00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.240\nSo, for\nthis example I want to do a field update,\n\n136\n00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.306\nso I wanna update the opportunity name.\n\n137\n00:07:58.306 --> 00:08:02.574\nSo, I'm gonna call this\none UpdateOpportunityName.\n\n138\n00:08:02.574 --> 00:08:06.436\nBecause these sit in different sections\nas far as what the criteria is, and\n\n139\n00:08:06.436 --> 00:08:11.050\nthen what the action is, you wanna be\ndescriptive as you can at this point too.\n\n140\n00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.790\nSo, what is the field to update,\nand we're gonna look for\n\n141\n00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.240\nthe standard field because\nit is a standard field.\n\n142\n00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.240\nAnd we're looking for name here,\nopportunity name to be specific,\n\n143\n00:08:22.884 --> 00:08:27.680\nAnd we wanna use the formula to set\nthe new value, so what is the formula?\n\n144\n00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:33.100\nIf you know how to write code well, or\nhow to write this you can enter it here,\n\n145\n00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:38.450\nbut I use the formula editor and\nI'm wanna search for the field,\n\n146\n00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:43.310\nand I wanna go into the opportunity,\nand I'm going to look for.\n\n147\n00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.310\nSo, I wanna change it to the account name.\n\n148\n00:08:48.058 --> 00:08:55.200\nAnd I wanna do, I created previous,\nprior to this an auto number.\n\n149\n00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.370\nSo, this way each opportunity\nname is unique, and\n\n150\n00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:03.010\nthe auto number generated\nare created is a unique number, so\n\n151\n00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:07.430\nI'm gonna enter this because\nI want a space there.\n\n152\n00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:10.517\nAnd I'm gonna search for\n\n153\n00:09:10.517 --> 00:09:16.250\nthe auto number that I\ncreated on the account.\n\n154\n00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:20.080\nSo, I may have just called it\n\n155\n00:09:29.724 --> 00:09:31.451\nRight here,\nI created it on the opportunity.\n\n156\n00:09:31.451 --> 00:09:32.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So,\n\n157\n00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.090\nI'm pulling in from the opportunity and\nhere's the auto number.\n\n158\n00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:35.992\nI'm gonna insert it.\n\n159\n00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:40.660\nI wanna check it to make sure it's right,\nand\n\n160\n00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.900\neverything looks good,\nthe formula is correct.\n\n161\n00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.500\nIt's pulling in the right value that\nit needs to, I'm gonna hit save.\n\n162\n00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.060\nSo, now we're on the last step,\nso we've done it.\n\n163\n00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.780\nThis is showing you the rule,\nthe evaluation criteria.\n\n164\n00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.630\nIs this whenever\nan opportunity is created and\n\n165\n00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:01.040\nit's greater than or equal to today,\nthis is the rule below that will trigger.\n\n166\n00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.564\nDo I need to add a task?\n\n167\n00:10:02.564 --> 00:10:04.210\nIt can run a new task.\n\n168\n00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.590\nAnd from here, just like a task in\nSalesforce, whatever the required\n\n169\n00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:14.040\nfields are, is also gonna be the required\nfields that you need to run the action.\n\n170\n00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.680\nSo, who am I sending this automated\ntask to, you can do the lookup,\n\n171\n00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.050\nand you can select the user.\n\n172\n00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.158\nBut keep in mind,\nthis is an active workflow.\n\n173\n00:10:22.158 --> 00:10:24.500\nSo, it's gonna run across the board for\n\n174\n00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.680\nevery single record that\nmeets this criteria.\n\n175\n00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.670\nSo, you can just do the Rogue,\nthe owner of the record.\n\n176\n00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:37.170\nAnd you can select whoever the account\nowner or whoever the opportunity owner is.\n\n177\n00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.480\nWe're looking at two\ndifferent objects here.\n\n178\n00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.150\nRight now, in this example\nI'll use opportunity owner.\n\n179\n00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.900\nThis way it's dependent on who\nthe owner is of the record and\n\n180\n00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.680\nnot just one specific\nperson across the board.\n\n181\n00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.934\nSo, and what would you always\nlike that subject to say or task?\n\n182\n00:10:53.934 --> 00:10:58.030\nSo, send an email, what's the status\nthat it should be, what's the due date.\n\n183\n00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:02.450\nThis is gonna go off the rule trigger\ndate or the opportunity close date.\n\n184\n00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.860\nBut, we can look at the role\ntrigger date plus three days.\n\n185\n00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.700\nAnd if there's any comments\nyou wanna add to it,\n\n186\n00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.788\nyou can add that here and then we're\ngonna hit save, and you can see for\n\n187\n00:11:11.788 --> 00:11:14.922\nthis one workflow,\nyou have two different actions.\n\n188\n00:11:14.922 --> 00:11:17.883\nIt's gonna send a task,\nit's gonna do a field update,\n\n189\n00:11:17.883 --> 00:11:20.970\nif you wanted to send an email,\nyou can do that as well, and\n\n190\n00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:24.210\nthis is just automating your\nentire business process.\n\n191\n00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:28.150\nI mean, you can do this for\nmany different things.\n\n192\n00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:32.230\nAnd I'll show you email templates,\nwhere I have those mail mergers stored,\n\n193\n00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:36.070\nso all this stuff is just generating and\nbeing ran automatically without you having\n\n194\n00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:39.440\nto do, or your users having to do,\nany of the work.\n\n195\n00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:45.760\nIt just takes more customization\nby as the system admin to set up.\n\n196\n00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.460\nIt's important to know where\nto go to make these changes.\n\n197\n00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.370\nDone, we can see that here, final.\n\n198\n00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.080\nOne small thing,\ndon't forget to activate it.\n\n199\n00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.540\nI've gone through and set up work for\n\n200\n00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.630\nroles before, and\ntry to figure out why it's not working and\n\n201\n00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.720\nit's just hit the activate button after\nyou've selected done, one more step.\n\n202\n00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.604\nIt's activated, it's working,\nbut you wanna test it, so\n\n203\n00:12:07.604 --> 00:12:10.889\nevery time you create a work flow rule,\ntest, test,\n\n204\n00:12:10.889 --> 00:12:15.782\ntest and let's just start with creating\na new one but I'm gonna generate it from\n\n205\n00:12:15.782 --> 00:12:20.456\nthe account, because if I'm generating\nan opportunity without an account\n\n206\n00:12:20.456 --> 00:12:25.014\nname we're not gonna pull in the merge\nfield that we have in that formula.\n\n207\n00:12:25.014 --> 00:12:29.450\nSo, I'm gonna select and\ncreate an opportunity from the account\n\n208\n00:12:31.944 --> 00:12:37.138\nAnd I'm just gonna name it Testing 123,\nbecause as we save,\n\n209\n00:12:37.138 --> 00:12:43.020\nand not until the record is saved,\nwill the workflow be active and work.\n\n210\n00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.510\nSo, that's another common\nquestion I've seen on the exam.\n\n211\n00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:49.190\nSo, at what point does\na workflow trigger and start?\n\n212\n00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:52.920\nIt's not into the point\nthat the record is saved.\n\n213\n00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.120\nAt that point,\nthen it evaluates the criteria.\n\n214\n00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:00.690\nI've been asked before, hey the\nopportunity name's soon be changing, or\n\n215\n00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:04.510\nsaving, up dating mid,\nas you're filling it out and editing.\n\n216\n00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.800\nAnd it doesn't work that way,\nyou have to save the record.\n\n217\n00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:13.815\nTo do something like that you need\ntriggers, apex triggers, and class and\n\n218\n00:13:13.815 --> 00:13:17.565\ncode, and a visual first page in order\nto do more of that heavy customization.\n\n219\n00:13:17.565 --> 00:13:18.505\nBut right now,\n\n220\n00:13:18.505 --> 00:13:23.485\nI think this is great for anyone\nwith an enterprise licence or above.\n\n221\n00:13:23.485 --> 00:13:26.125\nSo, enter some of your\nrequired fields here.\n\n222\n00:13:26.125 --> 00:13:28.325\nLet's say this is in\na qualification process,\n\n223\n00:13:28.325 --> 00:13:32.660\nand as long as my required field\nfilled out, I can see the record.\n\n224\n00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:39.290\nAnd this should evaluate the rule, and\nbecause we have feed tracking set up,\n\n225\n00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:43.166\nyou can see and\nhold your users accountable.\n\n226\n00:13:43.166 --> 00:13:46.855\nSo, I change the opportunity name and\nthis is a workflow updating and\n\n227\n00:13:46.855 --> 00:13:50.240\nkinda evaluating for us and\nconfirming for us that it did work.\n\n228\n00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.866\nSo, It's pulling in the account name and\nthe auto number of the opportunity,\n\n229\n00:13:54.866 --> 00:13:56.840\nplus the opportunity name here.\n\n230\n00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.660\nAnd then, you can see the task that was\ncreated with this opportunity of sending\n\n231\n00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:07.629\nemail open activity, and it's assigning to\nthe owner which is myself at this point.\n\n232\n00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.880\nSo, that's just an example of\nwhat a wor flow rules can do,\n\n233\n00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.883\nwhat some of the automation\nprocess looks like,\n\n234\n00:14:15.883 --> 00:14:19.780\nbut let's go over to approval\nprocess in Salesforce.\n\n235\n00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.220\nSo, wor flow rules and approval processes,\n\n236\n00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.520\nthese all falls into the same\ncategory when you're taking the test.\n\n237\n00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:31.130\nSo, we're gonna go into approvals and\nit falls under the same section.\n\n238\n00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:34.310\nSo, you can set up here and\n\n239\n00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:38.970\nas a system admin, manage and\nkeep track of your approval process.\n\n240\n00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.650\nSo, in order for\na record to continue to be editable,\n\n241\n00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:46.620\nyou can lock a record based\noff disapproval status.\n\n242\n00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:51.388\nSo, in order to move maybe an opportunity\nfrom one stage to the next, or\n\n243\n00:14:51.388 --> 00:14:55.044\nto confirm an amount, and\nyou have to get it approved,\n\n244\n00:14:55.044 --> 00:14:59.670\nyou need to set up this approval\nprocess so that the record is locked.\n\n245\n00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.903\nAnd that the approver approves\nthe record change in order for\n\n246\n00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:07.830\nit to be unlocked and\nable to make changes again.\n\n247\n00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.140\nSo, let's just go through\ncreate new approval process.\n\n248\n00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.210\nAnd I like the jump start wizard.\n\n249\n00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:20.160\nBecause it makes it easier at this point\nhere you just specify the criteria.\n\n250\n00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.680\nSo, what's the criteria to make\nsomething locked in order to be\n\n251\n00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.870\nneeding approval,\nin order to be edited again.\n\n252\n00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.710\nSo, its locked and it needs approval.\n\n253\n00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:35.218\nYou set that criteria,\nyou can use both criteria are met or\n\n254\n00:15:35.218 --> 00:15:39.820\nset up a formula in order for\nthis to meet the criteria here.\n\n255\n00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:44.600\nYou create the name so\nmaybe its an opportunity.\n\n256\n00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:50.720\nAmount and you can have the email.\n\n257\n00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:53.530\nAnd all of this is looking to\nour communication templates.\n\n258\n00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.280\nSo right now,\nthis is what Salesforce gives you,\n\n259\n00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:02.270\nbut you should have some\npre-built out templates within.\n\n260\n00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:05.140\nSo, we're just gonna\npick any random one here.\n\n261\n00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.610\nAnd then, you set your criteria.\n\n262\n00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.260\nAt this point here you\nselect the approver.\n\n263\n00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.530\nSo, if you have approval rights,\n\n264\n00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:20.090\nyou'll be selected as approver or you can\nautomatically assign who the approver is.\n\n265\n00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.220\nOr you can give it some\nkind of hierarchy level\n\n266\n00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.270\nbased off this hierarchy\nlevel you have set here.\n\n267\n00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:30.070\nSo, you can leave it up to\nthe user to choose it manually.\n\n268\n00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.380\nBut, those are your three options there.\n\n269\n00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:37.835\nAnd what it would look like for you being\nthe approver is you would go into your\n\n270\n00:16:37.835 --> 00:16:43.350\nhomepage, and at the very bottom we've\ngone through task in your calendars.\n\n271\n00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:46.170\nBut you'll see items to approve.\n\n272\n00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:50.980\nSo, if you were request to be\nan approver on a record to unlock it and\n\n273\n00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:56.620\ngive approval, you would see a list of\nthose records here and you manage all.\n\n274\n00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:02.400\nAnd so this will show you the list of\nthe records that need to be approved, and\n\n275\n00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:08.290\nthen you can assign it to someone else or\napprove and reject it.\n\n276\n00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:14.384\nYou can follow that process there with\nworkloads and approval processes.\n\n277\n00:17:14.384 --> 00:17:17.190\n&gt;&gt; That leads us to another thing you\nmentioned earlier, email templates.\n\n278\n00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.340\nCould you give us a peek at those?\n\n279\n00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:19.970\n&gt;&gt; Great question.\n\n280\n00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.940\nYes, so let's go back over to and\nnavigate to the communication templates.\n\n281\n00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.120\nSo, this is what you would use.\n\n282\n00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.755\nIt lives in its own section called\ncommunication templates, and\n\n283\n00:17:29.755 --> 00:17:32.930\nthis is what you would use\nanytime you would send an email.\n\n284\n00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.373\nSo, we went through,\nlet's go to email templates here, and\n\n285\n00:17:36.373 --> 00:17:38.370\nthis is what Salesforce gives you.\n\n286\n00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.630\nSo, we saw this in the last few minutes.\n\n287\n00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.182\nSo, you have support emails,\nmarketing emails, sale emails.\n\n288\n00:17:44.182 --> 00:17:49.096\nBut, if you wanna create a new template,\nyou have the options of\n\n289\n00:17:49.096 --> 00:17:54.465\nusing a text template, HTML, custom or\neven customize it further and\n\n290\n00:17:54.465 --> 00:17:58.385\nuse Visualforce to create\nthese email templates.\n\n291\n00:17:58.385 --> 00:18:02.881\nSo, I'm gonna select text, and\nI can do mail merge on here.\n\n292\n00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:04.685\nSo, I can select the field types,\n\n293\n00:18:04.685 --> 00:18:07.557\nI can pull into fields from\nhere in the body of my email.\n\n294\n00:18:07.557 --> 00:18:13.457\nAnd I would rename it, I can make these\npublic or I can make them private.\n\n295\n00:18:13.457 --> 00:18:17.720\nAnd I can select this one, once I select\navailable for you, it's pretty much you're\n\n296\n00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.390\nactive saying that this is something\nyou can use on future workflows.\n\n297\n00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.590\nSo, you have to give it a template name.\n\n298\n00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.620\nYou have to give it a subject,\nand then the body.\n\n299\n00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:31.684\nSo, in the body you can select hey,\nand merge field from contact name.\n\n300\n00:18:31.684 --> 00:18:34.110\nYou gonna get the gist there.\n\n301\n00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:38.650\nAnd it's great to use for follow up\nof cases, when a cases generated and\n\n302\n00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:43.350\nyou wanna send that contact notification\nthat you received their case.\n\n303\n00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:48.630\nThat's this that's just examples of ways\ntemplates can be used to be automated,\n\n304\n00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.340\nso you want to store them here.\n\n305\n00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:54.230\nThey will live as email templates and\nthat's what Salesforce uses when it looks\n\n306\n00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:57.550\nto hey,\nwhat email template do you wanna use?\n\n307\n00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:02.522\nBecause you need the email template\nto exist first, in order to even\n\n308\n00:19:02.522 --> 00:19:07.774\ncreate an actionable item of sending\nout an email, as a workflow task.\n\n309\n00:19:07.774 --> 00:19:10.790\nSo, that's great point to bring up,\nmake sure the template exists.\n\n310\n00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.730\n&gt;&gt; All right, Felicia, I'll tell you\ntowards the beginning of this when you had\n\n311\n00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.840\nsaid how this is one of\nyour favorite sections.\n\n312\n00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can see why and\n\n313\n00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.480\nI think I'm gonna join you on that.\n\n314\n00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.570\nAny time we can start to automate things.\n\n315\n00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.550\nIt's one, gonna make our lives easier.\n\n316\n00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.350\nAnd two, make things consistent\nlike the whole renaming,\n\n317\n00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:30.320\nmaking sure of that there are always names\nwith that same format, and we so love it.\n\n318\n00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.800\nAnd we appreciate those\ngreat demonstration there.\n\n319\n00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.240\nHope everybody enjoyed watching this one.\n\n320\n00:19:35.240 -->

ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.140\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\n\n7\n00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.750\nand today we're doing our\nSalesforce Certified Administrator.\n\n8\n00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.360\nIn this episode we're gonna be\nlooking at mobile, and app exchange.\n\n9\n00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.980\nAnd here to help us with that is Ms.\nFelicia Duarte.\n\n10\n00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.970\nWelcome back, Felicia.\n\n11\n00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.250\n&gt;&gt; Great, thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.010\nSo today, I'm gonna cover in this episode,\n\n13\n00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.340\nthe Salesforce1 Mobile and\nthe app exchange.\n\n14\n00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.160\nEach of these has its own\nsection within the exam itself.\n\n15\n00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.957\nSo 2% for the Salesforce1 and then 2% for\n\n16\n00:00:42.957 --> 00:00:46.960\nthe app exchange as far as\nthe weighing on the exam itself.\n\n17\n00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.510\nSo let's dive in into the Salesforce One.\n\n18\n00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.640\nSo I'm gonna go through\nsome of the setup features,\n\n19\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.860\nand then show you what it looks like for\nmobile using the Salesforce1.\n\n20\n00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.920\nSo I'm gonna go into setup Just to show\nyou what kind of changes you can make.\n\n21\n00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.120\nFirst you want to make\nsure that within the user,\n\n22\n00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.490\nthat they have access to\nusing the Salesforce1.\n\n23\n00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.870\nSo you want to first start there,\n\n24\n00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.750\nmake sure that every user\nhas access to even login.\n\n25\n00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.690\nAnd then they would want to make sure.\n\n26\n00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.200\nInstall the app into their phone,\nso that's the second step.\n\n27\n00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.670\nAnd then comes the customization.\n\n28\n00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.900\nSo you can set the branding.\n\n29\n00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.930\nJust color, layout,\n\n30\n00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.460\nthat's as far as customizations,\njust basic level, that you need to know.\n\n31\n00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.450\nThe brand color,\nthe loading page color and the logo.\n\n32\n00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.790\nNow you can do further and\nheavier customizations but\n\n33\n00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.910\nthat's not included on the test as\nfar as if you wanna start adding\n\n34\n00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.850\nvisual force pages for portal users.\n\n35\n00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.830\nThat would require more\nconfiguration there.\n\n36\n00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.080\nBut right now know that you\ncan do the brand color,\n\n37\n00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.200\nthe loading page color and\nthe logo itself.\n\n38\n00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.380\nAnd then let's go over into Settings.\n\n39\n00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.490\nAnd so as you saw,\n\n40\n00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.060\nI typed in Salesforce, is gonna\nfall under the Salesforce1 section.\n\n41\n00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.290\nWithin a mobile administration.\n\n42\n00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.930\nSo we navigate up here\nto Salesforce1 Settings.\n\n43\n00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.692\nYou can see some of the settings\nthat you have here.\n\n44\n00:02:07.692 --> 00:02:11.870\nSo whether you want to enable\nit first when you come here.\n\n45\n00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.000\nBy default, it's checked all ready.\n\n46\n00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.330\nAnd then you have the device access\nsettings, so by default it is checked\n\n47\n00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.830\nthat Salesforce1 will important contacts\nfrom the mobile device contact list.\n\n48\n00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.670\nAnd then those are really\nyour two options there.\n\n49\n00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.395\nThere's not a whole lot of customizations,\nbut you can kinda change what the look and\n\n50\n00:02:31.395 --> 00:02:34.635\nfeel is for the mobile user and\nwhat that experience is like.\n\n51\n00:02:34.635 --> 00:02:37.475\nAnd this is, again, your Salesforce user.\n\n52\n00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:41.915\nPortal is a whole other topic, but right\nnow we're strictly talking about how to\n\n53\n00:02:41.915 --> 00:02:44.065\nnavigate with the objects\nyou've created and\n\n54\n00:02:44.065 --> 00:02:49.075\nbuilt out from maybe your reps\non the go or out on the field.\n\n55\n00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:50.815\nSo it's just an easier way to navigate.\n\n56\n00:02:50.815 --> 00:02:55.750\nAnd then we have, hide this over here.\n\n57\n00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.340\nWe'll have a way to show\nyou what it looks like.\n\n58\n00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.320\nSo what I like to use is Google Chrome.\n\n59\n00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.820\nGoogle Chrome has apps\nthat you can install.\n\n60\n00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.370\nOne of them that I installed\nis the Salesforce1 simulator.\n\n61\n00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.520\nSo that's just a way of\ntesting your work so\n\n62\n00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.820\nyou can see what it looks like for\nyour end user.\n\n63\n00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.250\nSo it was an app that I installed,\nI would search Salesforce.\n\n64\n00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.500\nAnd then you'll see this one right here,\nwhich is a Salesforce1 simulator.\n\n65\n00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.967\nAnd I have already checked\ninto it the first for\n\n66\n00:03:23.967 --> 00:03:29.895\nit is every time you log in whether\nits from a new IP address or\n\n67\n00:03:29.895 --> 00:03:31.545\nif it's going to be from\nyour mobile versions.\n\n68\n00:03:31.545 --> 00:03:36.455\nOr if you're having your users\nset up on the mobile versions,\n\n69\n00:03:36.455 --> 00:03:39.655\nit's not recognizing where\nyou're logging in from so\n\n70\n00:03:39.655 --> 00:03:42.595\nyou're going to have to\ngenerate an access code.\n\n71\n00:03:42.595 --> 00:03:45.755\nSo an access code will be\nemailed to the user and\n\n72\n00:03:45.755 --> 00:03:47.880\nit's going to look to the user email.\n\n73\n00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.930\nAnd send that code,\nwhich is only valid for 24 hours.\n\n74\n00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.430\nSo, myself, I logged in.\n\n75\n00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.650\nIt didn't recognize me.\n\n76\n00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.710\nSo I sent over an email and\nI had already entered my access code.\n\n77\n00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:05.230\nSo now that I've entered it I have\naccess into the Salesforce1 mobile app.\n\n78\n00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.130\nIf your user tries to log in,\nthey install the app onto their phone and\n\n79\n00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.600\nit is not selected that they have\naccess as a Salesforce1 user\n\n80\n00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.280\nthey will not be able to\nget to pass that point.\n\n81\n00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.920\nThe log in permission, they don't\nhave the right permissions to log in.\n\n82\n00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.480\nSo another alternative is they can go into\nthe salesforce.com website itself and\n\n83\n00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.410\nuse the log in, but they have more of a\ndesktop version feel through their phone.\n\n84\n00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.390\nAnd so, this is just a faster experience,\nand the UI of it is great.\n\n85\n00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.180\nSo everything, you see your objects\nare now, see, sitting to your left.\n\n86\n00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.300\nSo we have your chatter feed up here,\nand as I sit the hamburger menu,\n\n87\n00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.240\nyou have your dashboards and tasks at\nthe top, but it's also gonna show you what\n\n88\n00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.690\nare some of your recent items or\nobjects that you've been into.\n\n89\n00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.330\nSo your accounts.\n\n90\n00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.890\nIt's gonna show you a list\nof recent accounts.\n\n91\n00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.880\nAnd it's showing you in\na different setting, and\n\n92\n00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.410\nit's using more the Salesforce Lightning\n\n93\n00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.810\nfeatures that you'll start to take note\nof as we're moving away from Classic.\n\n94\n00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.730\nSo your files, you can see your files, you\ncan see Dashboards, Reports, all the same\n\n95\n00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:16.880\nobjects and custom objects that you've\nbuilt you can see in your Salesforce1 app.\n\n96\n00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.140\nSo I'm gonna click through here.\n\n97\n00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.510\nAnd if you wanted to change to\nthe full site, you can do so.\n\n98\n00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.780\nI have some users who prefer it.\n\n99\n00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.180\nBut once you start getting used to the\nSalesforce1 mobile app and where things\n\n100\n00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:35.020\nare I know, adoption wise, this difficult\nmoving from one system to the next but\n\n101\n00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.390\nit takes getting used to and it makes,\nand it takes making it set up so\n\n102\n00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.120\nit's easier for, and training for\nthe users to know where to navigate here.\n\n103\n00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.910\nSo, from here you can\nsearch your accounts.\n\n104\n00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.420\nSo as I'm typing in it's\ngonna make some suggestions.\n\n105\n00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.120\nSo I was searching for Cloud Creations and\nit showed me both a parent and child\n\n106\n00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.320\naccount, so I'm gonna hit headquarters,\nand now this is what a record looks like.\n\n107\n00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.150\nSo what you have at the bottom\nare your global options, here.\n\n108\n00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.090\nYou're on a phone, you can make a call\ndirectly from the record itself.\n\n109\n00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.195\nAnd you can log task here.\n\n110\n00:06:11.195 --> 00:06:13.932\nNew events, post.\n\n111\n00:06:13.932 --> 00:06:19.360\nAnd then, if you scroll down with your\nfinger when you're on your mobile device.\n\n112\n00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.940\nYou can see a list of more\nof your fields there.\n\n113\n00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.880\nIn order to navigate to your related list,\nit takes more clicks.\n\n114\n00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.560\nBut once you adjust to where\nthings are laid out and\n\n115\n00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.110\nhow because you are limited\nwith a mobile device.\n\n116\n00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.900\nIt gets easier and\nit's easy to use and quick to use.\n\n117\n00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.530\nSo, you can sign in and start making\nsocial media accounts on here.\n\n118\n00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.560\nSo you're able to see the feed if you\nhad that enable for your accounts.\n\n119\n00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.420\nAnd see their Twitter feeds, their most\nup to date information for any accounts.\n\n120\n00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.690\nAnd then relay the list populate here.\n\n121\n00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.860\nSo, if you had any contacts or\n\n122\n00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.130\nopportunities I have one opportunity\nassociated I can click into it.\n\n123\n00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.730\nAnd I can see these details here.\n\n124\n00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:07.589\nOnce I'm clicked into it, so\nnow I'm in the opportunity object.\n\n125\n00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:15.150\nI'm sorry, opportunity related list\nof the account I was in, this is\n\n126\n00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:20.250\nwhere you go when you're out on the field\nand you want to create a new opportunity.\n\n127\n00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.230\nMaybe for\nthe account that you're visiting.\n\n128\n00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.640\nMaybe you see there is a potential order.\n\n129\n00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:30.230\nSo you create this information and\nall the work flow rules that we've created\n\n130\n00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.720\nwill run and generate any time you save\nthe record whether it's from a mobile\n\n131\n00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.610\ndevice or from your desktop we\ncreated from this account here.\n\n132\n00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.480\nAnd same thing like you would\nany of your other fields,\n\n133\n00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.328\nyou have these options\nhere to make changes.\n\n134\n00:07:44.328 --> 00:07:53.410\nAnd then [INAUDIBLE] Opportunity 2,\nand hit Save.\n\n135\n00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.010\nAnd so same everything else applies.\n\n136\n00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.030\nSo whether there's validation rules that\nyou've created on any of the objects, or\n\n137\n00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.780\nthere's required fields right\nhere which is closed date.\n\n138\n00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:10.280\nIt is not going to pull up the menu\nlike we did in desktop version.\n\n139\n00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:16.067\nBut I'm just going to, I was going for\nyear 1999 over there [LAUGH].\n\n140\n00:08:16.067 --> 00:08:17.183\nWe're in 2000.\n\n141\n00:08:17.183 --> 00:08:19.966\nNot any better, but [LAUGH].\n\n142\n00:08:19.966 --> 00:08:20.918\nLet me go over here.\n\n143\n00:08:20.918 --> 00:08:26.053\nAnd it's a great way to show you that\nthis has to be a date in the future.\n\n144\n00:08:26.053 --> 00:08:31.300\nSo 2019,\nit's a very long sales process here.\n\n145\n00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.050\nAnd we're gonna go and\n\n146\n00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:37.130\nwe have to have a stage so\nwe're just prospecting at this point.\n\n147\n00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:41.970\nAnd I'm going to select save and\nopportunity two was created.\n\n148\n00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:48.460\nSo now we're back here into our\nopportunity that was created and\n\n149\n00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.960\nagain we had a work flow\nthat was triggered.\n\n150\n00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.860\nSo now it change the name\nof the opportunity.\n\n151\n00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.670\nAnd that will, again that work flow role\nthat we applied in one of our previous\n\n152\n00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:03.300\nepisodes works across on all records\nby the criteria that you give it.\n\n153\n00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.090\nSo, that's the way it looks\nwithin Salesforce, and\n\n154\n00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.368\nif I hit Show More,\nyou have more options here.\n\n155\n00:09:09.368 --> 00:09:14.460\nSo it poll and questions are related\nto charter, so if you wanna link\n\n156\n00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:19.460\nany of that or add links or attach notes\nhere, same things like you could do with\n\n157\n00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.610\ndesktop version, it's just is displayed\nIt differently, laid out differently.\n\n158\n00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.460\nYou can from this page change the owner.\n\n159\n00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:30.080\nAnd so you can be on the go as a sales\nusers and do a lot of those customizations\n\n160\n00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.270\nfrom your phone, from your iPads, and\nany mobile device that is not desktop.\n\n161\n00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:39.300\nAnd then if you needed to log a call,\n\n162\n00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.690\nagain you saw those in not the edit\nfield but the actual layout here.\n\n163\n00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:47.970\nI'm not on an actual mobile device.\n\n164\n00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.620\nI cannot place a call,\nbut you can log calls and\n\n165\n00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.900\nas you're using your device you can\nsign in from there and log those calls.\n\n166\n00:09:54.900 --> 00:10:00.400\nSo that's just to show\nyou the Salesforce1 app.\n\n167\n00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.540\nThe next thing I'd like to go\nthrough is the app exchange.\n\n168\n00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.350\nSo this counts for 2% and\nI'm gonna close this out.\n\n169\n00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:15.970\nAnd the app exchange is just a web\ndirectory of apps that we're creating\n\n170\n00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:21.510\non the force.com platform by other\ndevelopers, other partners of Salesforce,\n\n171\n00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:25.300\nand there is a lot of great apps out\nthere, and there are a couple version,\n\n172\n00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.710\ntwo different ways to have those\napps installed into Salesforce.\n\n173\n00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:33.641\nSo, as I go over to,\nI'm gonna go to set up.\n\n174\n00:10:33.641 --> 00:10:38.810\nAt the very bottom I'm gonna search\nin my quick client actually for\n\n175\n00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:44.555\nthe app and is always at the very end,\nit's an app exchange marketplace.\n\n176\n00:10:47.205 --> 00:10:50.595\nAnd now this is gonna take you,\nand this is just a great place\n\n177\n00:10:50.595 --> 00:10:54.135\ndepending on the industry or\ntools you looking to have available,\n\n178\n00:10:54.135 --> 00:10:58.535\nto search for different apps that you\ncan add on and install into Salesforce.\n\n179\n00:10:58.535 --> 00:11:02.885\nAnd there's a lot of great apps out there,\nfor project management, for accounting,\n\n180\n00:11:02.885 --> 00:11:07.690\nfor anything pretty much\nis already built out of it.\n\n181\n00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:12.220\nIf, say if there's gaps within what sales\nforce can't do, a lot of these developers\n\n182\n00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:17.170\nand third party partners of sales force\ncreated these apps to be installed in it.\n\n183\n00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:20.330\nAnd triggers can be installed\nin these work flows.\n\n184\n00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:26.500\nLotus automation whether it's paid or\nfree can be installed into\n\n185\n00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:31.510\neither your production environment which\nis life or I would suggest your Sandbox\n\n186\n00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:36.780\nenvironment first to test to see how\ndoes it work with my existing data.\n\n187\n00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.750\nWhat changes can I make to any app.\n\n188\n00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.400\nSome are managed, so for\n\n189\n00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:47.400\nmanaged apps you can't make changes\nto the code that they installed.\n\n190\n00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.850\nAnd for some apps that aren't managed you\ncan work with the code that they have in\n\n191\n00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.900\nthere to do even further customizations,\nwhich is great.\n\n192\n00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.530\nSo you had the options right here\nat the app exchange marketplace.\n\n193\n00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.450\nYou can search for apps.\n\n194\n00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.420\nYou can search based off topics.\n\n195\n00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.110\nBut there are suggestions that are given.\n\n196\n00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.530\nKong is a popular app, Docusign.\n\n197\n00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:12.300\nAnd then it's grouped by popularity,\nnew ones but then paid versus free.\n\n198\n00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:16.520\nSo, let's do a free app.\n\n199\n00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.980\nAnd Salesforce gives you some,\nyou can tell by the Salesforce Labs.\n\n200\n00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.700\nSo, Salesforce CRN Dashboards.\n\n201\n00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.020\nAnd I'm in a developer edition, for\n\n202\n00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:29.540\nthose free ones,\nyou can still definitely install those in.\n\n203\n00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.551\nSo if you're working and\nsetting up with another org,\n\n204\n00:12:33.551 --> 00:12:36.660\nand you wanna test out how this app works,\nyou wanna\n\n205\n00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:42.200\nsee does it do the functionality before I\nrecommend it that it say here the details.\n\n206\n00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.870\nI usually always have my developer account\nand I install plenty of different apps\n\n207\n00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:51.520\nthere just to test it out and\nsee how does it work with test data.\n\n208\n00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.080\nSo when you go into the app, itself,\n\n209\n00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:59.560\nyou can see the overview of it,\nthe details, and the reviews.\n\n210\n00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.060\nSo overview, high level overview,\nsometimes there's videos,\n\n211\n00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.390\nsometimes there's\npictures related with it.\n\n212\n00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:08.350\nRight here, for this one,\nthis is saying, hey, it's a free app.\n\n213\n00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.850\nThis is a company that's\nmaking this app available,\n\n214\n00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:16.500\nand then there's some minimum requirements\nthat you need, so your edition.\n\n215\n00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.570\nIs Professional Edition,\nEnterprise Edition,\n\n216\n00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.600\nwhat edition do I have to have for\nthis to work?\n\n217\n00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.673\nSo you'll find that\ninformation in the details.\n\n218\n00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.918\nNow once this loads, you can see to your\nright the requirements that you need to\n\n219\n00:13:29.918 --> 00:13:34.155\nhave, we're in the right, we're in\ndeveloper right now so we're good.\n\n220\n00:13:34.155 --> 00:13:37.925\nAnd if there's any other requirements\nin order to install this\n\n221\n00:13:37.925 --> 00:13:38.645\nyou'll see that there.\n\n222\n00:13:38.645 --> 00:13:41.427\nAnd then Reviews,\nI would always look at the stars.\n\n223\n00:13:41.427 --> 00:13:43.327\nWhat's the reviews before\nI install something in?\n\n224\n00:13:43.327 --> 00:13:49.047\nWhat are some common issues that other\nSalesforce users are having with this app?\n\n225\n00:13:49.047 --> 00:13:50.687\nBefore I install,\njust to give you a good idea.\n\n226\n00:13:50.687 --> 00:13:52.267\nAnd it's real simple.\n\n227\n00:13:52.267 --> 00:13:54.917\nYou're just gonna select Get It Now.\n\n228\n00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:57.857\nSalesforce makes everything,\nif you haven't noticed, pretty intuitive.\n\n229\n00:13:57.857 --> 00:14:00.507\nSo, you have this option right here.\n\n230\n00:14:00.507 --> 00:14:01.467\nSo, where do you wanna do it?\n\n231\n00:14:01.467 --> 00:14:05.030\nDo you wanna,\nright now it's not capturing,\n\n232\n00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:07.560\nif you can see at the top right my login.\n\n233\n00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.800\nFor some reason I'm locked out,\nso I have a login,\n\n234\n00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.370\nsomeway to log into the app exchange.\n\n235\n00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:20.370\nAnd then it should either recognize me\nbecause I'm in one of these tabs or it may\n\n236\n00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:24.650\nask me to log in again with Salesforce,\nso we'll give it a minute there.\n\n237\n00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:30.550\nAnd now I can see if I select this,\nit sees my developer account,\n\n238\n00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.450\nand any other information\nthat I had stored there.\n\n239\n00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:35.110\nI'm logged in, so\nnow it's gonna prompt me to\n\n240\n00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:39.020\ninstall this in either the production\nenvironment or Sandbox environment.\n\n241\n00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:42.600\nRight now we're just gonna do\nproduction because as a developer, or\n\n242\n00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.580\nif you don't have access to Sandbox.\n\n243\n00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.230\nThat is very much your Sandbox there.\n\n244\n00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:50.980\nAnd I have read and agreed,\nthis is telling you what\n\n245\n00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:55.880\nthe package installing is,\nwhether it's free or paid, does it expire,\n\n246\n00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.460\nto who, who's installing it's, and\nwe're going to confirm and install.\n\n247\n00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:07.330\nSo once this is installing,\nusually this one is a pretty fast install.\n\n248\n00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:12.070\nSome of the larger ones that include\nmore on their package, it takes longer.\n\n249\n00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:15.770\nAnd then, you do have the option\nof who can I install this to.\n\n250\n00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:20.090\nThis is the question I see when it comes\nto what options ou have available,\n\n251\n00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.940\ncan you you choose to\nhave it installed for\n\n252\n00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:26.060\nall users for\nspecific profiles or admins only?\n\n253\n00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.360\nSo this is usually a multiselect so\n\n254\n00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:33.560\nmake sure that you are able to\nselect that it is an admin users and\n\n255\n00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:39.280\nthen profiles as your options\nto open up access to an app.\n\n256\n00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.500\nSo what if existing\ncomponents names conflict?\n\n257\n00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.380\nYou have the option of\nchoosing don't install or\n\n258\n00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:47.500\nrename conflicting components and package.\n\n259\n00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.008\nSo I'm not sure if this one exists or\nnot but\n\n260\n00:15:50.008 --> 00:15:53.290\nif I've already downloaded\nit I'm gonna hit install.\n\n261\n00:15:56.124 --> 00:16:01.050\nAnd as this is installing I'm gonna\nshow you where to go to see your install\n\n262\n00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:01.863\npackages.\n\n263\n00:16:01.863 --> 00:16:07.840\nSo I'm gonna click right back\ninto the set up, and in my quick\n\n264\n00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:13.620\nfind search I'm gonna type installed and\nthis will populate under build.\n\n265\n00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:14.597\nSo installed packages.\n\n266\n00:16:16.915 --> 00:16:20.270\nAnd right now it's still installing so\nwe're not gonna see it there.\n\n267\n00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.470\nIt doesn't look like I have\nany installed packages, but\n\n268\n00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.400\nonce I do, let's check in and see.\n\n269\n00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:31.330\nOnce I do it will live there and\nthen you can see the, what type of?\n\n270\n00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:32.180\nWhat type of information?\n\n271\n00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.110\nWhat type of data do it give you?\n\n272\n00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:34.050\nDid it give you any triggers?\n\n273\n00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:36.380\nDoes it give you any new reports?\n\n274\n00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.800\nThis one, if we look back,\nwe selected serum dashboards.\n\n275\n00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.950\nWhat we can expect to see are some\nnewly created dashboards.\n\n276\n00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:45.310\nI can expect some folders.\n\n277\n00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.660\nIt's placed in this category here.\n\n278\n00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:49.894\nSo let's go to the details.\n\n279\n00:16:52.228 --> 00:16:55.620\nAnd sometimes there's documentation\nlinks that are attached with it.\n\n280\n00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.440\nFor most of these building companies,\nthey do provide documentation, so\n\n281\n00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:04.110\nyou know where to go,\nwho to contact, provide support,\n\n282\n00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:08.210\na lot of these companies, especially the\npaid versions provide support when you do\n\n283\n00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:12.610\nneed to go out to them and\nneed further configuration.\n\n284\n00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:16.540\nBecause the apps, itself,\nrequire system admins.\n\n285\n00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:20.890\nEven further configuration than anything\nwe've shown you with sales force.\n\n286\n00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.110\nBut when it comes to the test, itself.\n\n287\n00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:25.590\nIt will not ask about any specific app.\n\n288\n00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:29.656\nIt's mostly related to when you\ninstall it, who has permission,\n\n289\n00:17:29.656 --> 00:17:32.630\nwhen you install it,\nwhere can you install it.\n\n290\n00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:37.370\nSo just having knowledge\nof these basics that we\n\n291\n00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:39.900\nreviewed here will be sufficient to\nanswering any of those questions.\n\n292\n00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.510\n&gt;&gt; All right, fantastic there Felicia,\n\n293\n00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:47.460\nnow a good look at how we can extend\nthe functionality really of Salesforce.\n\n294\n00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.250\nWe've got our mobile platforms\nthat we can work with.\n\n295\n00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.350\nWe can install the Salesforce app and\n\n296\n00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.610\nreally get access to everything\nwe had in the desktop platform.\n\n297\n00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:57.620\nAnd there's apps by third parties and\n\n298\n00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:01.590\neven Salesforce that can fill in some\nof those gaps as Felicia was saying.\n\n299\n00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.480\nWhere maybe that functionality's\nnot included in the base product.\n\n300\n00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.210\nBut somebody else has created something\nto fill in that gap, that need,\n\n301\n00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:10.830\ncuz probably if one company needs\nit there's other organizations\n\n302\n00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:11.760\nthat would love that as well.\n\n303\n00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.540\nSo great look there at how we\ncould extend that functionality.\n\n304\n00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.890\nHope everybody enjoyed watching this one.\n\n305\n00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.180\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n306\n00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.140\n&gt;&gt; I'm Felicia
