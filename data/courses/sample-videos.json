TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.680\nI'm your host Daniel Arin,\nand here with me,\n\n4\n00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.130\na man who knows a lot\nabout Windows Server.\n\n5\n00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.150\nThat man is Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.330\nHow's it going to day Mike?\n\n7\n00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.350\n>> It's going great Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.840\nI'm excited to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.375\nIn this episode, we're gonna look at\ninstalling Windows Server 2012 R2.\n\n10\n00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:30.790\nNow when we install a server there's\na couple of different ways we\n\n11\n00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:31.430\ncould install it.\n\n12\n00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.780\nIn this first episode we're\ngonna look at installing it,\n\n13\n00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.390\nwhat I would like to call normally.\n\n14\n00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.140\n>> Right, just the de facto.\n\n15\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.010\n>> Yeah, right?\n\n16\n00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.050\nWhen you install a server, or you install\nany operating system you expect to\n\n17\n00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.260\nfinish it, reboot that machine and\nyou come up and you login and\n\n18\n00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.240\nyou've got a desktop and\nall of that good stuff, right and\n\n19\n00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.550\nwe can interact with our keyboard and\nour mouse and that kind of thing.\n\n20\n00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.370\nAnd we can definitely do that with server,\nit's not the only option.\n\n21\n00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.060\nWe're going to cover some of the other\noptions in some later episodes.\n\n22\n00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.110\nIn this one, we're going to install\nit again, what I call normally.\n\n23\n00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.580\nWhat Microsoft's going to call\nis a full or standard install.\n\n24\n00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.150\nThat means we're going to install server,\nand when we're done,\n\n25\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.660\nwe're going to have a desktop.\n\n26\n00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.400\nWe're going to have a GUI.\n\n27\n00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.470\nWe're going to have all those\nadministrative tools that we need so\n\n28\n00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.790\nto work with our server.\n\n29\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.400\nAnd I think that's what most people\nare probably used to or accustomed to.\n\n30\n00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.620\nBut before we install it, we need to\ntalk about what our requirements are.\n\n31\n00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.150\nWe need to know what it\nis that I need to have\n\n32\n00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.400\nto make sure that I can successfully\ninstall server 2012 R2.\n\n33\n00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.400\n>> I've got a 386 Mike.\n\n34\n00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.360\nThat's plenty of horsepower, right?\n\n35\n00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.021\n>> Sure, should be perfect, right.\n\n36\n00:01:38.021 --> 00:01:40.705\n[LAUGH] You could use that if\nyou don't want it to work.\n\n37\n00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:42.640\n[LAUGH]\n>> He was hoping.\n\n38\n00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.730\n>> Yeah, you know.\n\n39\n00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.230\nYou'd be surprised, you're close actually.\n\n40\n00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.280\nIt doesn't take a lot.\n\n41\n00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.200\nBut it is going to take\na little bit more than a 386.\n\n42\n00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.230\nFor the processor, you're going to need\n\n43\n00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.340\nat least a 1.4 gigahertz 64 bit processor.\n\n44\n00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.270\nFor memory, now get this one Daniel,\n512 megabytes of RAM.\n\n45\n00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.380\n>> Wow.\nThat's not a lot.\n\n46\n00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.040\n>> It's not much.\n\n47\n00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.820\n>> That's, that's pretty cheap nowadays.\n\n48\n00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.530\n>> It really is.\n\n49\n00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.230\nI mean you can't buy a box\nwith less than that.\n\n50\n00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.500\nAnd for your disc space, you're going to\nneed 32 gigabytes of free disk space.\n\n51\n00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.480\n>> Also not a lot.\n\n52\n00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.352\n>> Easy breezy right.\n\n53\n00:02:17.352 --> 00:02:18.336\n>> [CROSSTALK] I mean it\nwill work out pretty easily.\n\n54\n00:02:18.336 --> 00:02:19.335\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n55\n00:02:19.335 --> 00:02:21.580\nHere's the catch though.\n\n56\n00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.100\nThose are what we call\nthe minimum system requirements.\n\n57\n00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.058\nWhat that means is you can install Server\n2012 R2 with a 1.4 gigahertz processor.\n\n58\n00:02:30.058 --> 00:02:36.300\nA 32 gigabyte drive or freespace,\n32 gigabytes and 512 megabytes of RAM.\n\n59\n00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.100\nNow the question is, are you gonna be\nhappy with the performance of that server\n\n60\n00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.160\nwhen you're done installing it?\n\n61\n00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.752\nWhat do you think, Daniel?\n\n62\n00:02:41.752 --> 00:02:43.713\n>> It'll probably run like a sick dog.\n\n63\n00:02:43.713 --> 00:02:46.465\n[LAUGH] Not very well or far.\n\n64\n00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:47.672\n>> Exactly.\n\n65\n00:02:47.672 --> 00:02:51.515\nIt's gonna just chug along and the other\nthing you've got to keep in mind,\n\n66\n00:02:51.515 --> 00:02:54.370\nthat's just for\nthe operating system itself.\n\n67\n00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.060\nSo if I wanna add roles, and I wanna\nadd DNS or DHCP or Active Directory and\n\n68\n00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.000\nthings like that, I've gotta go look\nat what the requirements are for\n\n69\n00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.730\nthose roles cuz they're gonna require,\nlike DNS is memory intensive.\n\n70\n00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.670\nIt has to load of up all of those zones.\n\n71\n00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.260\nSo depending on what\nroles we're installing\n\n72\n00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.160\nI've gotta add to those requirements.\n\n73\n00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.770\nRight?\n\n74\n00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.940\nSo yes, you could install Server 2012\nR2 with a 1.4 gigahertz processor,\n\n75\n00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.570\n512 megs of RAM,\n32 gigabytes of free disk space.\n\n76\n00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.440\nBut in the end,\nyou're never gonna do that.\n\n77\n00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.000\nRight?\nBecause you're\n\n78\n00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.190\nnot just going to install a server and\nlet it sit there and run.\n\n79\n00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.400\nRight.\nBut for the exam you gotta know what those\n\n80\n00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.010\nminimum requirements are so\nthat's why we're informing you.\n\n81\n00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.090\nBut in the real world, Danny,\nyou're not gonna install a server,\n\n82\n00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.650\nprocessor wise, the biggest,\n\n83\n00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.200\nbaddest processor you got, as many\nprocessors as you can put in there, right?\n\n84\n00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.990\nIt's gonna make it run better.\n\n85\n00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.410\nMemory wise, I don't think I've ever run\na server with less than two gigs of RAM.\n\n86\n00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.760\nIn a virtualized environment, and\nlooking at some of our install options,\n\n87\n00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.475\nmaybe a little bit less, but\nI would say two gigs minimum, real world.\n\n88\n00:03:55.475 --> 00:03:56.908\n[SOUND]\n>> It's a must have.\n\n89\n00:03:56.908 --> 00:04:01.000\nI've run plenty of virtual servers,\nand physical servers.\n\n90\n00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.350\nTwo gigs is, in my opinion,\nthe bare minimum.\n\n91\n00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.670\nOtherwise, like we said,\nit's gonna run like a sick dog.\n\n92\n00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.420\nIt's just not gonna give you even just\na standard experience when you think,\n\n93\n00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.580\nthe mouse moves.\n\n94\n00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you double click on something and\n\n95\n00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.230\nit opens up in some sort of timely manner.\n\n96\n00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.120\nOr you're not running\noff to the bathroom and\n\n97\n00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.500\ngetting a cup of coffee,\nand doing all that.\n\n98\n00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.790\nYou come back, you're still waiting for\nthe hourglass to spin.\n\n99\n00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.430\nNow, we want some performance.\n\n100\n00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.380\nServers usually require\na little bit performance.\n\n101\n00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.550\nLike Mike said, you can put this\non a minimal amount of hardware,\n\n102\n00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.820\nand they give you that.\n\n103\n00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.530\nAnd that's for like worst case scenario.\n\n104\n00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.540\nThis is all you have laying around,\nold stuff sitting in a closet somewhere.\n\n105\n00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.740\nBut if you have the means,\nwe're going to go ahead and tell you.\n\n106\n00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.700\nGo ahead and\ngrab some more hard drive space,\n\n107\n00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.640\ngo ahead and grab some more CPU power,\na little more RAM.\n\n108\n00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.610\nYou'll probably have an easier time\nmaking this thing do what it is.\n\n109\n00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.225\nYou'd like it to do right Mike.\n\n110\n00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:53.620\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n111\n00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.940\nSo give it as much resources\nas you've got available\n\n112\n00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.570\nto make that performance acceptable.\n\n113\n00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.220\nAll right so\nwe've got our minimum requirements down.\n\n114\n00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.740\nThe next thing we've got to do is just\ngo ahead and install Server 2012 R2 and\n\n115\n00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.820\nlike I said we can install server\na couple of different ways.\n\n116\n00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.240\nAnd I'll show you when we\ngo through our demo here.\n\n117\n00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.160\nSo let me go ahead and fire up my machine.\n\n118\n00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.320\nAnd I've got a virtual machine here and\nit's already got the ISO loaded up so\n\n119\n00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.880\nyour Server 2012 R2 disc\nis in the CD-ROM drive.\n\n120\n00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.790\nAnd while that's loading up I'm\ngonna go run grab a key for\n\n121\n00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.890\nthis and I can throw this link\nout there for you guys later.\n\n122\n00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.270\nThese are some KMS keys\nprovided by Microsoft.\n\n123\n00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.330\nThey're not valid keys,\nthey won't actually activate,\n\n124\n00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.070\nthey'll allow to get through that\ninstall for labs and things like that.\n\n125\n00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.030\nThey're designed really for KMS setups\nwhen you're setting up a licensing server\n\n126\n00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.040\nbut you need to get the image installed\nfirst before it can reach out and\n\n127\n00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.630\ntalk to your licensing server.\n\n128\n00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.120\nThat's what those keys are for.\n\n129\n00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.570\nSo I'm gonna grab one of those real quick.\n\n130\n00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.250\nAnd now back over to the virtual machine.\n\n131\n00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.810\nSo, again, I've put that disk in and\n\n132\n00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.540\nof course the server\n2012 R2 disk is bootable.\n\n133\n00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.710\nSo the server is booting up.\n\n134\n00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.530\nThere's nothing on the hard drive.\n\n135\n00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.170\nSo I didn't have to hit, like,\nthe any key to boot to the CD Rom.\n\n136\n00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.070\nIt's gonna straight to it.\n\n137\n00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.040\nBecause it sees that there's\nnothing on the hard drive there.\n\n138\n00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.160\n>> I would assume this would\nalso work with USB drives and\n\n139\n00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.860\njust putting the ISO on that, and\npop that in set it to boot from USB.\n\n140\n00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.230\nYou'll probably get the same effect.\n\n141\n00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.880\n>> Exactly.\n\n142\n00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.210\nThe only thing you might have to do is\nmake sure in the BIOS of that machine,\n\n143\n00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.370\nthat it's allowed to boot to the USB.\n\n144\n00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.325\nSometimes you've gotta go in and\nturn that feature on.\n\n145\n00:06:29.325 --> 00:06:31.180\n>> Awesome.\n>> All right, so there we go, so\n\n146\n00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.340\nthis is the screen that's gonna pop up,\nand\n\n147\n00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.940\ninstalling Server 2012 R2\nis extremely easy really.\n\n148\n00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.770\nIt's going to walk me through the process.\n\n149\n00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.443\nThe first thing it asks me is what\nlanguage I want to use, what my time and\n\n150\n00:06:42.443 --> 00:06:45.506\ncurrency format's going to be and\nwhat my keyboard or input\n\n151\n00:06:45.506 --> 00:06:49.637\nmethod is going to be and there are drop\ndown lists and you can pick from several.\n\n152\n00:06:49.637 --> 00:06:54.430\nWell, except for this particular disk,\nI think, is only US or EN-US.\n\n153\n00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.120\nSo I don't get to see\nall the other languages.\n\n154\n00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.230\nWhich is great for\nme because that's my native language.\n\n155\n00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.040\nThat's what I speak, so.\n\n156\n00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.590\n>> You don't like it in Africana?\n\n157\n00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.010\n>> You know,\nI don't speak Chinese very well so\n\n158\n00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.300\nI'm not gonna have a very\ngood time installing it.\n\n159\n00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.160\n>> There is that.\n\n160\n00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.340\n>> [LAUGH] So\nI'll go ahead and click Next.\n\n161\n00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.590\nAnd then, Install Now.\n\n162\n00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.910\nI don't know.\nSo far, what do you think Daniel?\n\n163\n00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.180\n>> You know what, since Windows 7 really,\n\n164\n00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.810\nI've thought Microsoft has done\na really good job with their installer.\n\n165\n00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.290\nIt used to be a little bit more difficult,\n\n166\n00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.810\nespecially back if you come from Windows\n3.1 and Windows 95 and Windows 98.\n\n167\n00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.120\nYou had to use boot discs and\nall this other stuff,\n\n168\n00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.180\nto do formatting of disc utilities and\nstuff like that.\n\n169\n00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.350\nThese graphical interfaces for\ninstallation make our lives\n\n170\n00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.590\na whole lot easier, and\nquickly too, it doesn't take long.\n\n171\n00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.620\nI think I successfully splint\nup either a Windows 7 or\n\n172\n00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.344\nWindows 8.1 in under ten minutes.\n\n173\n00:07:43.344 --> 00:07:46.550\n>> Yeah.\n>> Under ten minutes from start to finish.\n\n174\n00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.410\nBlank disk to working the operating\nsystem in under ten minutes.\n\n175\n00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.911\nThat's really good, so\n\n176\n00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:56.130\nI expect some performance somewhere\nalong those lines with servers.\n\n177\n00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.250\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n178\n00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.819\nCuz remember, we're not extracting\nall those files out anymore,\n\n179\n00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:02.480\ndecompressing them over the hard drive,\nthings like that.\n\n180\n00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.955\nWe're basically applying an image, right?\n\n181\n00:08:03.955 --> 00:08:09.540\nThere's a WHM file on that disc, on that\nDVD, and that's really all you're doing.\n\n182\n00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.620\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and paste that key\nin there, hopefully that'll paste in.\n\n183\n00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.510\nVery good.\n\n184\n00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.510\nSo there's my product key.\n\n185\n00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:16.482\nI'll click Next.\n\n186\n00:08:19.421 --> 00:08:25.030\nAnd then I get to choose which edition\nbasically, or version I want to install.\n\n187\n00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.190\nNow depending on the disk you have,\nyou might see different options.\n\n188\n00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:32.655\nThe key that I just put in was for\n2012 R2 Standard.\n\n189\n00:08:32.655 --> 00:08:36.690\nSo notice the only thing that\nshows up is 2012 R2 Standard.\n\n190\n00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:40.300\nWith the right disk though it\nincludes all the different editions.\n\n191\n00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.226\nSo if I had got the data center key and\nput that in there, when I got to this\n\n192\n00:08:44.226 --> 00:08:48.437\nscreen it would have given me the option\nto choose Data center if I wanted to.\n\n193\n00:08:48.437 --> 00:08:50.120\nAnd then you can see I've got two options.\n\n194\n00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.870\nI've got server core, and\nI've got server with a GUI.\n\n195\n00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:56.560\nNotice that the default\nis actually server core.\n\n196\n00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.910\nThis is what Microsoft wants us to use.\n\n197\n00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.720\nAnd I'm going to do another episode where\nwe cover installing server core, and\n\n198\n00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.340\nseeing how to configure that.\n\n199\n00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.290\nFor right now,\nwe're going to go server with a GUI.\n\n200\n00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.151\nAnd I'll click Next.\n\n201\n00:09:11.657 --> 00:09:14.346\nAnd then of course I'm gonna\nhave to agree to the EULA or\n\n202\n00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:15.929\nI'm not gonna get any further.\n\n203\n00:09:15.929 --> 00:09:18.959\n>> That's one of my favorite\ntypes of things that happen.\n\n204\n00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:23.018\nI'll get a user that'll call me up and say\noh I've got this thing on my screen and\n\n205\n00:09:23.018 --> 00:09:24.360\nI don't know what to do.\n\n206\n00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.580\nAnd there's only one option,\nlike Mike has right here, do I accept it?\n\n207\n00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.330\nIf I don't I can't go any further.\n\n208\n00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.250\nSo if you see these types of things,\nthere's only one option.\n\n209\n00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.529\nThat's your option.\n\n210\n00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:35.737\n[LAUGH]\n>> Notice my uncheck at the next\n\n211\n00:09:35.737 --> 00:09:36.810\nbutton-\n>> Just goes\n\n212\n00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:37.760\naway\n>> Yeah.\n\n213\n00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.190\nSo you're pretty much\nforced to choose that.\n\n214\n00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.778\nI'll click Next.\n\n215\n00:09:40.778 --> 00:09:44.030\nAnd then I have to tell it\nwhere I want to install it.\n\n216\n00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.201\nNow it could be doing an upgrade.\n\n217\n00:09:45.201 --> 00:09:48.301\nMaybe this computer already has\nan operating system on it and\n\n218\n00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:50.745\nI'm trying to upgrade to server 2012 R2.\n\n219\n00:09:50.745 --> 00:09:52.980\nAgain that will be another\nepisode we'll deal with that.\n\n220\n00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.060\nFor this one I'm just going to use\ncustom install because I don't have\n\n221\n00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.160\nanything to upgrade.\n\n222\n00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.320\nSo I couldn't choose that upgrade option.\n\n223\n00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.970\nAnd then it's gonna scan and\nshow me what hard drives I have available.\n\n224\n00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.011\nI see I have one drive that's\n60 gigabytes in size, so\n\n225\n00:10:06.011 --> 00:10:09.067\nthat meets my minimum\nrequirements of 32 gigabytes.\n\n226\n00:10:09.067 --> 00:10:12.379\nI could go ahead and\ncreate a partition here if I wanted to,\n\n227\n00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:14.284\nif I had a 500 gigabyte drive.\n\n228\n00:10:14.284 --> 00:10:19.510\nAnd I wanted to go ahead and create a 64\ngigabyte partition to install the OS in.\n\n229\n00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.220\nAnd use the other space for\nsomething else later.\n\n230\n00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.080\nI could do that, I could click new.\n\n231\n00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.800\nIt would launch my little wizard, and\n\n232\n00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.180\nI could create a partition\nof a certain size.\n\n233\n00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.480\nIf you just leave it on\nthis unallocated space,\n\n234\n00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.090\nit's gonna claim the entire drive and\nuse all of that space.\n\n235\n00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.710\nWhich is fine with me.\n\n236\n00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:36.440\nI'll click Next.\n\n237\n00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.190\nAnd then that's pretty much it.\n\n238\n00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.210\nAt this point,\nit starts doing the install.\n\n239\n00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:47.920\nYou can see it's copying the files and\nit's getting ready for installation.\n\n240\n00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.670\nNow this might take I don't\nknow like you say, 10,\n\n241\n00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.020\n15 minute really depends on the speed.\n\n242\n00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.510\nLike doing it from CD-ROM as one\nof your slower methods or DVD.\n\n243\n00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.570\nLike Daniel said you had it on USB,\nmuch faster copy process and\n\n244\n00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.740\nthis can go a little bit quicker.\n\n245\n00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.000\nIn my case it'll probably take\nit a good 10, 15 minutes.\n\n246\n00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.402\nBut, we don't have to wait, Daniel.\n\n247\n00:11:08.402 --> 00:11:08.925\n>> No we don't.\n\n248\n00:11:08.925 --> 00:11:12.687\nThe magic of television, or\nthe fact that we use virtual machines,\n\n249\n00:11:12.687 --> 00:11:14.080\nmakes this a lot easier.\n\n250\n00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.110\nWe can actually start an installation on\none and move to the other where that's\n\n251\n00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.030\nalready at this point, or at least past\nthe point where we have to wait for it.\n\n252\n00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.020\nAnd do the whole, we're gonna put\na raw turkey into the oven and\n\n253\n00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.120\npull a baked turkey on out.\n\n254\n00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.370\nAnd that's the way we're gonna do that.\n\n255\n00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.670\nSo we won't make you wait\nthrough that whole process.\n\n256\n00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:34.965\nEven though I love to say, I spent\nabout roughly half my life waiting for\n\n257\n00:11:34.965 --> 00:11:36.408\na computer to compute.\n\n258\n00:11:36.408 --> 00:11:37.523\nTo just do something.\n\n259\n00:11:37.523 --> 00:11:40.801\nAll right sit down wait for\nyou to spin your little wheel or\n\n260\n00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:43.885\nyour little hourglass and\nthen get back into action.\n\n261\n00:11:43.885 --> 00:11:47.725\nBut fortunately we're not gonna bury you\nguys through that, we'll just go ahead and\n\n262\n00:11:47.725 --> 00:11:48.646\nmove on through it.\n\n263\n00:11:48.646 --> 00:11:49.284\n>> Exactly.\n\n264\n00:11:49.284 --> 00:11:51.870\nSo right now I again,\nI'm switching over to virtual machines.\n\n265\n00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:56.110\nI've got one that's already made\nit past that whole copy process.\n\n266\n00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.920\nAnd there you can see it.\n\n267\n00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.580\nLet me change one more thing on this guy.\n\n268\n00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:05.330\nI wanna go into my Settings and make sure\nhe is connected to the correct network, so\n\n269\n00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.660\nthat the rest of our lab will work.\n\n270\n00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.460\nSo let me change that over to a custom.\n\n271\n00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.410\nAgain, this isn't something you would do,\nthis is just something I'm doing for\n\n272\n00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:14.580\nthe virtual environment.\n\n273\n00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.330\nSo this is the screen you would come to,\nafter that whole copy and install process\n\n274\n00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.510\nthat we saw, that little wizard that was\njust giving me that spinning Cheerio.\n\n275\n00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.120\nOnce that finishes,\nyou would come to this screen.\n\n276\n00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:29.210\nHere it's asking me for a password, so\nI'm gonna set the administrator password.\n\n277\n00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:30.660\nSo, this would be the local admin,\n\n278\n00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.770\nand it helps if you give it\nfocus before you start typing.\n\n279\n00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:38.100\nThis is gonna be the local\nadmin password on this server.\n\n280\n00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.164\n>> Now that's a really good\npoint that you tell them,\n\n281\n00:12:40.164 --> 00:12:41.610\nthis is your local admin password.\n\n282\n00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.900\nSo you definitely wanna use some\nstrong security when it comes to\n\n283\n00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.200\nthis particular user, because well,\nthey've got the keys to the kingdom.\n\n284\n00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.170\nYou don't wanna just,\noh I'll put password one on that thing and\n\n285\n00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.410\nI'll change it later.\n\n286\n00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.994\nIf you've been around\nthe block at any given time,\n\n287\n00:12:55.994 --> 00:12:58.889\nyou'll know that that change\nit later tends to be never.\n\n288\n00:12:58.889 --> 00:13:02.990\n[LAUGH] Or\nafter a compromise has occurred.\n\n289\n00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:06.530\nAnd you're in your boss' office and he's\nscreaming at you and you can smell what he\n\n290\n00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:10.990\nhad for breakfast because he's in your\nface going, why did you let this happen.\n\n291\n00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.270\nChange that password.\n\n292\n00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.450\nUse something strong,\nlong passwords way to go.\n\n293\n00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:19.210\nWe always suggest passphrases that are\neasy to remember, they've got plenty of\n\n294\n00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:23.420\nlength to them and complexity is there\nas well, so they tend to cover that nut.\n\n295\n00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.580\n>> Exactly, and as you say,\nace the local admin password.\n\n296\n00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:29.387\nOnce we join this guy to the domain,\nwe rarely use that account and it's just\n\n297\n00:13:29.387 --> 00:13:32.330\nsitting there and it's going to be-\n>> Probably disabled, even.\n\n298\n00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.100\n>> Yes, hopefully we'll disable it,\nif not,\n\n299\n00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.030\nmake sure it's got a good strong password.\n\n300\n00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:39.179\nAll right, so I'll go ahead and log into\nthis guy using that same password, and\n\n301\n00:13:39.179 --> 00:13:41.067\nof course I used a very long,\nstrong password.\n\n302\n00:13:41.067 --> 00:13:41.852\n>> Oh yes.\n\n303\n00:13:41.852 --> 00:13:42.802\n>> Yeah.\n\n304\n00:13:42.802 --> 00:13:45.790\n[LAUGH] For\na lab environment we're okay, right.\n\n305\n00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.630\nI could've used password.\n\n306\n00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.000\nAll right, so here we are.\n\n307\n00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.220\nWe've finished installing and\nwe're logging in for the first time.\n\n308\n00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.730\nSo at the end of the install process,\nyou set that local admin password, and\n\n309\n00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.140\nthen it brings you to the logon screen and\nyou log on.\n\n310\n00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.210\nAnd this is it, our initial log on.\n\n311\n00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.740\nNow, the first thing that's going to\nhappen when you log on to this server,\n\n312\n00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.490\nserver manager's going to open up.\n\n313\n00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:09.440\nAnd server manager is a fantastic tool.\n\n314\n00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.930\nIt allows me to administer this server,\nand so much more.\n\n315\n00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:17.150\nWe've got a whole episode that we're going\nto dedicate to using server manager.\n\n316\n00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:23.290\nBut for now we'll just go ahead and\ndo what we call our post installation\n\n317\n00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.930\nconfiguration, cuz right\nnow it's a default install.\n\n318\n00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.230\nRight?\nAll we did was put the disk in there,\n\n319\n00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:31.380\nrun through the installation wizard,\nlet it do its thing,\n\n320\n00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.040\nset the admin password and log on.\n\n321\n00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.780\nSo once you get logged on the first time,\n\n322\n00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.680\nthat's when we do what we call our\npost installation configuration.\n\n323\n00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.380\nAnd the easiest way to do\nthat with a server with a GUI\n\n324\n00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.960\nis right here in server manager over\nhere in my navigation tree on the left.\n\n325\n00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.350\nI can click local server.\n\n326\n00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:52.160\nAnd this is going to bring me to a little\nscreen that shows me most of the settings\n\n327\n00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.110\nthat I need to configure for a server.\n\n328\n00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.722\nLike you can see things\nlike computer name,\n\n329\n00:14:57.722 --> 00:15:02.170\nthe fact that it's part of a workgroup,\ninformation about the firewall,\n\n330\n00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:04.731\nNIC teaming, my IP address information.\n\n331\n00:15:04.731 --> 00:15:08.754\nI can even scroll over I can see\ninformation about my Windows updates,\n\n332\n00:15:08.754 --> 00:15:12.451\nwhether or not I want to join\nthe customer improvement program.\n\n333\n00:15:12.451 --> 00:15:13.066\n>> Oh, I do.\n\n334\n00:15:13.066 --> 00:15:14.950\n>> Oh yeah, absolutely.\n\n335\n00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:17.397\nTime zone settings, all of that.\n\n336\n00:15:17.397 --> 00:15:19.627\nSo these are extremely convenient.\n\n337\n00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:24.016\nNow if you're used to working with older\nservers like 2003, Windows 2000 Serve or\n\n338\n00:15:24.016 --> 00:15:25.700\nsomething like that.\n\n339\n00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.690\nYou're used to going to\nlike system properties.\n\n340\n00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:29.250\nAnd you can still do that, right.\n\n341\n00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:33.510\nI can still do my Windows Key Pause Break\nshortcut and pull up system properties and\n\n342\n00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.360\nchange my computer name there.\n\n343\n00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.610\nI can go right-click on my\nclock down in my taskbar and\n\n344\n00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.300\nI can change my timezone and\nthings like that there.\n\n345\n00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.850\nSo those haven't gone away.\n\n346\n00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.550\nThis is like a one stop shop for\nall those settings.\n\n347\n00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:46.740\nRight here in this little window.\n\n348\n00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.550\nThat's what makes it so convenient.\n\n349\n00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.630\nSo the first thing I'm gong to do Daniel\nis change the name of the computer because\n\n350\n00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.870\nI don't like those names\nthat Microsoft generates.\n\n351\n00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.340\n>> But they're so\neasy to remember it's simple.\n\n352\n00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.739\n>> They're very descriptive right.\n\n353\n00:15:58.739 --> 00:15:59.705\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n354\n00:15:59.705 --> 00:16:04.421\nlet's change this to something\nlike svr01 And I'll click OK.\n\n355\n00:16:04.421 --> 00:16:09.240\nAnd any time you change the name of a\ncomputer, it is gonna require a reboot for\n\n356\n00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.210\nthose changes to go into effect.\n\n357\n00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.230\nNow I'll go ahead and\nreboot it, and let it reboot.\n\n358\n00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:17.230\nSome people, Daniel, like to go\nthrough all, they say restart later,\n\n359\n00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:20.760\ngo through some of their other\nsettings and then reboot it.\n\n360\n00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.670\n>> Yeah, I'm a restart later guy.\n\n361\n00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:26.220\nAnd also I did wanna\nbacktrack a little bit toward\n\n362\n00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.690\nthe actual naming of the server itself.\n\n363\n00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:33.430\nBe descriptive, right, make sure that\nyou have a naming convention in place.\n\n364\n00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.080\nEspecially if you're in a domain\nenvironment it makes things much\n\n365\n00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.710\nsimpler for you as administrators.\n\n366\n00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:42.000\nThis probably isn't in the exam,\nbut it's definitely helpful for\n\n367\n00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.020\nyou out there that's actually out there\nworking on Windows 2012 Server, or\n\n368\n00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.070\nany server for that matter.\n\n369\n00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:51.287\nMake those names something that\nyou understand what the role\n\n370\n00:16:51.287 --> 00:16:52.863\nof this server is for.\n\n371\n00:16:52.863 --> 00:16:57.163\nDon used to tell the story\nabout someone who named all\n\n372\n00:16:57.163 --> 00:17:02.440\nhis servers after Simpsons characters,\nHomer and Marge.\n\n373\n00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.040\nThe problem is, what happens\nwhen you try to log onto Homer?\n\n374\n00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.160\nWhat does Homer do?\n\n375\n00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.600\nI have no idea.\n\n376\n00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.080\nI don't know what Marge is meant for.\n\n377\n00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:12.500\nAnd so you if hire in new people or\nsomeone leaves or gets fired or\n\n378\n00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.460\nsomething like that.\n\n379\n00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.590\nSomeone comes in, they're gonna have\nto try to learn what each one of these\n\n380\n00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:20.970\nservers do cuz their names sure as heck\nisn't telling them anything about it.\n\n381\n00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.880\nSo be descriptive when\nyou name these servers.\n\n382\n00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:28.830\nWhen I worked at an insurance company,\nwe were the Florida branch.\n\n383\n00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:32.455\nWe covered the whole state of Florida so\nwe started everything with FL,\n\n384\n00:17:32.455 --> 00:17:35.860\nthat designated us out from everyone\nelse in the other states so\n\n385\n00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:40.160\nwe knew, okay, those are our servers,\nFL file serve 01 right?\n\n386\n00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.250\nThat way I can have file serve 02,\nfile serve 03, it's a file server.\n\n387\n00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:48.700\nWe know exactly what it's for, what state\nit's in, and how many of them there are.\n\n388\n00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.310\nEasy simple naming convention that\nwill save you a lot of time and\n\n389\n00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:53.460\nheadache down the road.\n\n390\n00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.448\nSo put some thought into\nwhen you name those servers.\n\n391\n00:17:56.448 --> 00:17:59.000\n>> Oh, absolutely, a very good suggestion.\n\n392\n00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.980\nAll right, so I'm gonna go back, and\nI've rebooted after the name change.\n\n393\n00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.120\nI'm coming back over here to local server,\nand\n\n394\n00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.070\nthen I can see the new name on my machine.\n\n395\n00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:10.085\nNext thing I'm gonna do is I'm\ngoing to change the time zone.\n\n396\n00:18:10.085 --> 00:18:12.980\nSo I'm gonna click on\nmy time zone over here.\n\n397\n00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.040\nAnd I'm going to change that.\n\n398\n00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.810\nWe're here in Florida, so that's going\nto be Eastern, or GMT minus 5, or\n\n399\n00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.470\nI'm sorry, UTC now, right?\n\n400\n00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.280\nIt's not GMT anymore.\n\n401\n00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:25.480\nAnd I'll change that and the time does not\nlook correct either, so we'll go ahead and\n\n402\n00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.500\nchange the time as well.\n\n403\n00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:32.331\nIt should be somewhere around, what is it?\n\n404\n00:18:32.331 --> 00:18:35.164\n>> We are at almost 2 o'clock, 1:59.\n\n405\n00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:41.310\n>> Let's change that,\n59 there, something like that.\n\n406\n00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:42.110\nClose enough.\n\n407\n00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:45.430\nWe'll click OK, and we'll click OK.\n\n408\n00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.910\nNow you'll notice that Server Manager, it\ndoesn't look like I changed my time zone.\n\n409\n00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:52.490\nI just went in there and changed it,\nit still says UTC-08:00.\n\n410\n00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:56.060\nThis will update every few minutes,\nI think it's five by default.\n\n411\n00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:00.073\nIf you want, you can go ahead and click\nthis refresh icon up at the top to make\n\n412\n00:19:00.073 --> 00:19:02.497\nsure your changes have been configured,\nand\n\n413\n00:19:02.497 --> 00:19:05.074\nthere I can see UTC-05:00 at this point.\n\n414\n00:19:05.074 --> 00:19:08.790\nAll right, so I've got my name and\nmy time zone set.\n\n415\n00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:12.070\nThe next thing I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna set my IP address.\n\n416\n00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.630\nRemember, with your servers,\n\n417\n00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:17.090\nmore than likely you're gonna\nhave a static IP address.\n\n418\n00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:19.380\nSo I'm gonna come in here and change that.\n\n419\n00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.090\nPull up the properties\nof my ethernet adapter.\n\n420\n00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.745\nYou guys have seen this in Network+,\nso nothing fancy here.\n\n421\n00:19:24.745 --> 00:19:29.680\n10, my network is a 1.1 network and\nwe'll go 201 for my first server.\n\n422\n00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:36.947\nGood old class C subnet mask and\nthis the important part right here, DNS.\n\n423\n00:19:36.947 --> 00:19:38.460\nAnd this is why I do this.\n\n424\n00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.563\nI'm doing this kind of in a certain order.\n\n425\n00:19:40.563 --> 00:19:44.130\nIt doesn't really matter if you change\nthe name versus the time zone first.\n\n426\n00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:45.440\nOne of the things you do have to do,\n\n427\n00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.405\nthough, is configure DNS before\nyou can join your domain.\n\n428\n00:19:49.405 --> 00:19:53.750\nCuz in order for this server to join\nthe domain, it has to be able to find\n\n429\n00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:58.660\nthe domain controller so that it can\ncreate that account in Active Directory,\n\n430\n00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.330\nverify that I have permissions to join the\nserver to the domain, things like that.\n\n431\n00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:06.180\nSo you need the DNS server from your\nnetwork that can resolve the name of\n\n432\n00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.480\nthe domain controller.\n\n433\n00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.466\nI see this a lot, Daniel, where\npeople will be setting up servers and\n\n434\n00:20:10.466 --> 00:20:13.711\nthey might've gotten an IP address\nfrom DHCP, and it's using a public DNS\n\n435\n00:20:13.711 --> 00:20:16.957\nserver or something like that,\nwhich would give you Internet access, and\n\n436\n00:20:16.957 --> 00:20:19.053\nyou might think\neverything's working great.\n\n437\n00:20:19.053 --> 00:20:20.476\nThen you go to join the domain and\n\n438\n00:20:20.476 --> 00:20:23.220\nit says cannot contact\nthe domain controller, fail.\n\n439\n00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.040\nBecause you've got the wrong DNS server.\n\n440\n00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.952\nSo we'll change that over to mine's,\n10.1.1.200.\n\n441\n00:20:29.952 --> 00:20:34.350\nAnd I'll click OK and\nOK to apply those changes.\n\n442\n00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.400\nAnd at this point,\nI can refresh Server Manager.\n\n443\n00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.950\nI should be good to go.\n\n444\n00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:45.612\nWhat I like to do is just open\nup a quick command prompt here,\n\n445\n00:20:45.612 --> 00:20:49.142\nif my server will play along with me.\n\n446\n00:20:49.142 --> 00:20:54.823\nAnd I wanna try to ping the domain\ncontroller, dc01.lab.net.\n\n447\n00:20:54.823 --> 00:20:58.650\nAnd it is good to use the fully\nqualified domain name.\n\n448\n00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:00.040\nIf you use just dc01,\n\n449\n00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.340\nlike in my case the NetBIOS name\non my domain controller is dc01.\n\n450\n00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.630\nAnd if I use that, in fact,\nI might be able to show you.\n\n451\n00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:09.457\nLet's see here, ping dc01.\n\n452\n00:21:09.457 --> 00:21:12.382\nYou see how it comes back\nwith that IPv6 address?\n\n453\n00:21:12.382 --> 00:21:16.170\nThat's a good indicator that it's\nnot using DNS to resolve the name.\n\n454\n00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:19.080\nIt's using that link local\nmulticast name resolution.\n\n455\n00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:22.560\nThe problem is that domain join\nwizard isn't gonna use that.\n\n456\n00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.240\nIt's gonna be using DNS,\nand so I'm not really\n\n457\n00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:29.520\ntesting whether my DNS is functioning\nproperly if I just ping the NetBIOS name.\n\n458\n00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.870\nSo ping the fully qualified domain name.\n\n459\n00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.750\nThat way you know you can\nreach that domain controller.\n\n460\n00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:35.940\nNow that I can reach\nthe domain controller,\n\n461\n00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.450\nDaniel, it's time to join the domain.\n\n462\n00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:42.230\nSo let's do it, we're gonna click up\nhere where it says Workgroup, and\n\n463\n00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:44.282\nI'll scroll back over so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n464\n00:21:44.282 --> 00:21:47.766\nClick Workgroup, I'll click Change, and\n\n465\n00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:52.668\nI'll go down here to domain and\nI'm going to put in lab.net.\n\n466\n00:21:52.668 --> 00:21:54.460\nAnd of course,\nit's gonna prompt me for credentials.\n\n467\n00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.020\nRemember, I'm logged on as a local admin.\n\n468\n00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.630\nThis guy's not part of the domain yet,\n\n469\n00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:01.590\nand the local admin has\nno rights on the domain.\n\n470\n00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:05.420\nIn order to join a computer to the domain,\nyou have to have a couple things.\n\n471\n00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.970\nYou have to have local admin rights, which\nI'm logged on as the local administrator,\n\n472\n00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.130\nso I've got that.\n\n473\n00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.860\nBut you also have to have\npermissions in Active Directory.\n\n474\n00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:17.780\nIf there's not an account already created\nfor the server, if it's not pre-staged,\n\n475\n00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.870\nthat means it gonna be creating an object\nin Active Directory when I do this.\n\n476\n00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:24.620\nThat means the account I'm using\nhas to have permissions to\n\n477\n00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.640\ncreate objects in Active Directory.\n\n478\n00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.590\nSo I'm gonna use good\nold lab\\administrator.\n\n479\n00:22:32.007 --> 00:22:33.690\nAnd the appropriate password.\n\n480\n00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:38.500\nAnd if all goes well, my account has the\nappropriate credentials and it can find\n\n481\n00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:44.260\nthe domain controller for lab.net, we'll\nget the welcome to the lab.net domain.\n\n482\n00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.334\nAnd we can click OK.\n\n483\n00:22:45.334 --> 00:22:46.230\n>> That's what you hope to get [LAUGH].\n\n484\n00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:47.840\n>> That's what we hope to get.\n\n485\n00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.530\nOK and Close.\n\n486\n00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:53.720\nAnd of course it's gonna require\na reboot for that change to take effect.\n\n487\n00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.023\nSo we'll let it reboot.\n\n488\n00:22:55.023 --> 00:22:58.125\nAnd then when it comes back up we should\nbe able to log on to the domain at\n\n489\n00:22:58.125 --> 00:22:58.725\nthis point.\n\n490\n00:22:58.725 --> 00:23:00.550\n>> Yeah, that's the bread and butter.\n\n491\n00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:04.570\nUsually if this isn't the first\nserver in your domain then obviously\n\n492\n00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.560\nit's probably going to be the first\ndomain controller at that point.\n\n493\n00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.480\nBut if it's not the first server and\nyou need it to join the domain so\n\n494\n00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.110\nit can have access to all the different\nresources that's on the domain,\n\n495\n00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:18.840\nuse your Active Directory logon,\nall the user accounts that you have there.\n\n496\n00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.930\nAnd then at that point,\nyou can set the roles up after that,\n\n497\n00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:25.410\nstart making the server do what it is\nyou're actually building it to do.\n\n498\n00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.960\nAnd again, we haven't really been\nworking at this for very long and\n\n499\n00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.360\nwe've even been explaining\nit step by step.\n\n500\n00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.900\nSo you can see it doesn't\nreally take that much time.\n\n501\n00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:37.770\nBack in the day, I remember installing\nWindows 2000, Windows 2003 servers,\n\n502\n00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:41.790\nthis was a good hour project easily,\nthat okay, well,\n\n503\n00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.680\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ninstall a server on something.\n\n504\n00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:48.190\nThat's gonna take me a little bit of time,\nand I'll be back in a little while.\n\n505\n00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:50.220\nNow the boss says go install a server,\n\n506\n00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.850\nyou're like, I guess that's ten minutes\nout of my day, 15 minutes out of the day.\n\n507\n00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:55.140\nIt's not really that hard anymore.\n\n508\n00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.347\n>> Depending on if they\nknow what they're doing.\n\n509\n00:23:56.347 --> 00:23:57.402\nOtherwise you might be\nable to stretch it out.\n\n510\n00:23:57.402 --> 00:23:57.902\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> That's right.\n\n511\n00:23:57.902 --> 00:23:59.262\n>> Go hide somewhere,\n\n512\n00:23:59.262 --> 00:24:03.303\n[LAUGH] play a little game on your phone.\n>> Oh, boss, this is It's killing me!\n\n513\n00:24:03.303 --> 00:24:04.516\n[LAUGH]\n\n514\n00:24:04.516 --> 00:24:05.915\n>> It's a lot of work.\n\n515\n00:24:05.915 --> 00:24:06.614\nAll right, so\n\n516\n00:24:06.614 --> 00:24:09.715\nhere I am back on this machine.\nIt has finished the reboot after joining\n\n517\n00:24:09.715 --> 00:24:10.340\nthe domain.\n\n518\n00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.240\nBut you'll notice what it says up here.\n\n519\n00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.150\nIt says SVR01/Administrator.\n\n520\n00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:18.930\nI could log on, but I'd be logging\non with a local admin account again.\n\n521\n00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:19.430\nRight.\n\n522\n00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:23.500\nSo I wanna try to log on to the domain\nwhich means I'm gonna do a switch user,\n\n523\n00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:32.765\nand then other user, and I'm gonna\nhave to specify lab\\administrator.\n\n524\n00:24:32.765 --> 00:24:33.935\nInteresting little tidbit here.\n\n525\n00:24:33.935 --> 00:24:36.255\nYou notice it says sign on to lab.\n\n526\n00:24:36.255 --> 00:24:36.775\nRight?\n\n527\n00:24:36.775 --> 00:24:38.635\nWhich is the name of my domain.\n\n528\n00:24:38.635 --> 00:24:41.175\nIf you leave off,\nif you don't specify the domain up here.\n\n529\n00:24:41.175 --> 00:24:45.550\nIf you just type administrator,\nnotice it switches to the local context.\n\n530\n00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:48.390\nIt assumes you want\nthe local admin account.\n\n531\n00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:51.500\nSo when you're logging onto\na members server, or a client for\n\n532\n00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.980\nthat matter, and you want to use\nthat built in administrator account,\n\n533\n00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.730\nyou do have to specify the name of\nthe domain out in front of there,\n\n534\n00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:03.410\noh that's the pre windows 2000 right,\nyou still could use the Oh, gosh.\n\n535\n00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.020\n>> Administrator at lab.\n\n536\n00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:06.705\n>> Yeah, I'm trying to think\nwhat the heck that name is.\n\n537\n00:25:06.705 --> 00:25:07.341\n>> Dot net or whatever.\n\n538\n00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:08.990\n>> It'll pop here in a second.\n\n539\n00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:10.360\nAnd then I'll have to use my password.\n\n540\n00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.710\nYou use a principal name.\n\n541\n00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:17.825\nI Almost forgot that one,\nbut administrator@lab.net.\n\n542\n00:25:17.825 --> 00:25:20.095\nYes, you are correct Daniel.\n\n543\n00:25:20.095 --> 00:25:21.085\nAll right and there we go.\n\n544\n00:25:21.085 --> 00:25:23.725\nSo now I can,\nnow I'm part of the domain, right.\n\n545\n00:25:23.725 --> 00:25:26.585\nI've logged on with a domain admin account\n\n546\n00:25:26.585 --> 00:25:30.010\nwhich means we've proved to ourselves\nthat this guy is part of the domain.\n\n547\n00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.730\n>> Right, and now things like,\ngroup policy is gonna set in.\n\n548\n00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:36.380\nSo whatever Mike has logged in as,\nobviously this is an administrative user,\n\n549\n00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:39.820\nhe's logging into a server,\nthat's what needs to be going on.\n\n550\n00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.580\nOther regular users shouldn't\nbe logging in that way.\n\n551\n00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:45.280\nBut he's gonna get that group policy,\nhe's going to say okay,\n\n552\n00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.520\nhere's the rights that you have, here's\nwhat you can do and what you can't do.\n\n553\n00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.950\nHere's how we set things up default.\n\n554\n00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:54.519\nThat's going to be nice for him because it\ngives him a standardized set of guidelines\n\n555\n00:25:54.519 --> 00:25:57.460\nwhich he can count on,\nno matter where he logs in.\n\n556\n00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.620\nYou'd be surprised at how\nmany people don't realize,\n\n557\n00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.570\nbecause they only work with\none computer everyday.\n\n558\n00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:03.820\nThat they don't realize that\ndomain is their friend.\n\n559\n00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.830\nThat their domain credentials\nare their friend.\n\n560\n00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:10.730\nThey could go to another workstation, sit\ndown, sign on with their credentials, and\n\n561\n00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:13.360\nget something that's very familiar,\nand sign on.\n\n562\n00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:16.680\nRight, that's always the pleasure of that,\nso very good stuff.\n\n563\n00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.360\n>> Very good, alright,\nthere we go I'm back on our machine,\n\n564\n00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.980\nI opened up server manager and\nwent back to local server one more time\n\n565\n00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.310\njust to prove to you guys that we\nare indeed part of the domain, and\n\n566\n00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:29.300\nas Daniel said that's it, now we're ready\nto do whatever we want with the server.\n\n567\n00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.060\nAdd roles, whatever functionality we need.\n\n568\n00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:35.760\nAnd we'll cover that in\nanother episode I think.\n\n569\n00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.630\n>> Put all you Sailor Moon\nvideos on there.\n\n570\n00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.145\nYou know, he loves the anime.\n\n571\n00:26:39.145 --> 00:26:39.755\n[LAUGH]\n>> Sh.\n\n572\n00:26:39.755 --> 00:26:40.420\n>> Alright, Michael\n\n573\n00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:40.920\nhas the-\n>> Sh.\n\n574\n00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.920\nIt's under the hat.\n\n575\n00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.000\n>> [LAUGH] That's\n\n576\n00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.738\nbasically covered the installation for\n\n577\n00:26:45.738 --> 00:26:48.705\nthe standard user experience, right?\n>> Yeah.\n\n578\n00:26:48.705 --> 00:26:49.915\nPretty straightforward process.\n\n579\n00:26:49.915 --> 00:26:51.830\nThe wizard walks you right through it and\n\n580\n00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:54.600\nthen that server manager with\nthat local server option\n\n581\n00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.920\nmakes your post installation\nconfiguration a breeze.\n\n582\n00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:57.580\n>> Awesome.\n\n583\n00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.730\nWell that about does it for this episode.\n\n584\n00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:02.480\nHopefully you guys have learned\na lot from it and go out there and\n\n585\n00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.490\nget you some server 2012 installed.\n\n586\n00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:07.060\nThat being said,\nit is time to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n587\n00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.150\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n588\n00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:09.930\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n589\n00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:11.104\n>> And

00:00:08.226\n[CROSSTALK]\n[SOUND]\n\n4\n00:00:08.226 --> 00:00:12.388\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.388 --> 00:00:14.436\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings, everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:14.436 --> 00:00:16.795\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:19.808\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n8\n00:00:19.808 --> 00:00:22.410\nwe are back with more of\nour Intro to Docker series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.640\nAnd of course, joining us in the studio is\nthe person that knows all things Docker,\n\n10\n00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.220\nour good friend, Mr Justin Dennison.\n\n11\n00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.480\nJustin, my man, how goes it today?\n\n12\n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.260\n&gt;&gt; It goes well, Daniel.\n\n13\n00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.020\nHow are you today?\n\n14\n00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.240\n&gt;&gt; Can't complain, thanks for asking.\n\n15\n00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.790\n&gt;&gt; I feel like you're overselling\nthat all things Docker stuff.\n\n16\n00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:37.895\n&gt;&gt; Just go with it, man.\n\n17\n00:00:37.895 --> 00:00:41.194\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Mainly because it is very complex, but\n\n18\n00:00:41.194 --> 00:00:43.734\nwe have been wading our\nway through Docker.\n\n19\n00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:47.740\nAnd we actually have a great amount\nof tools in our repertoire thus far.\n\n20\n00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.380\nWe're actually to a point to where\nwe can run containers, build images.\n\n21\n00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.814\nBut now how do I actually use\nthat technology that I've been\n\n22\n00:00:54.814 --> 00:00:57.293\nworking with to bundle up an application?\n\n23\n00:00:57.293 --> 00:01:02.150\nNow there's a couple of things you should\nknow before we start down that road.\n\n24\n00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.350\nI have chosen Node.js as our runtime,\n\n25\n00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.260\nnot because of any other\nreason than I had to pick one.\n\n26\n00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.030\nAnd well, it will work the same on Python,\nRuby, Go, Java, any JVM language.\n\n27\n00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.440\nThe setup's gonna be a little\nbit different but abstractly,\n\n28\n00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.780\nthe same process is gonna occur.\n\n29\n00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.730\nIn addition to, well, this is for\na deployment type mindset.\n\n30\n00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.705\nIt is not for an active development cycle.\n\n31\n00:01:27.705 --> 00:01:29.395\nIf you're a developer there,\n\n32\n00:01:29.395 --> 00:01:33.170\nI would actually mount the application\nsource code into the volume.\n\n33\n00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.343\nAnd then set up a different\ncontainer that would be the runtime.\n\n34\n00:01:36.343 --> 00:01:40.530\nThis is going to be all bundled up,\nsend this off to Docker hub and\n\n35\n00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.840\nthen run this through continuous\nintegration to run my test.\n\n36\n00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.130\nAlso do an inspection for\nsecurity flaws and the such.\n\n37\n00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.060\nSo those are important things to keep\nin your mind before we get started.\n\n38\n00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.310\nBut I think there's no better time\nthan now than let's take a look at\n\n39\n00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.540\nhow things are gonna play out.\n\n40\n00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.930\nLet's take a look at my screen here.\n\n41\n00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.560\nAnd so I'm on my desktop.\n\n42\n00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.990\nAnd if I ls here,\nI got this random folder.\n\n43\n00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.114\nBut I also have nodeapp version 1,\n2 and 3.\n\n44\n00:02:05.114 --> 00:02:10.270\nNow if I was actually on a development\ncycle, I would not keep multiple copies.\n\n45\n00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.717\nI would use some version control\nsystem like Git or Mercurial.\n\n46\n00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:17.383\nBut to keep things transparent and\na little easier to follow,\n\n47\n00:02:17.383 --> 00:02:21.770\nI've kept different copies of\nthe application in its different states.\n\n48\n00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.490\nIn addition to, we're gonna assume\nthat these are all finally done.\n\n49\n00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.360\nNow what does that mean?\n\n50\n00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.620\nThat means that you can bundle them up and\ndeploy them.\n\n51\n00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.358\nAnd we're going to work\nthrough these one by one.\n\n52\n00:02:35.358 --> 00:02:37.810\nYou gotta definitely finish\nout the folder name there.\n\n53\n00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:38.620\n&gt;&gt; It does help.\n\n54\n00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.630\n&gt;&gt; It does help.\n\n55\n00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.480\nAnd notice that all I\nhave in here is index.js.\n\n56\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.980\nWell, you don't have to\nknow anything about Node.\n\n57\n00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.570\nAll the source code will be\navailable to you in the show notes.\n\n58\n00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.261\nBut there will be a liittle bit\nof programming here and there.\n\n59\n00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:57.616\nYou don't have to know how to do it\nother than this little tiny segments.\n\n60\n00:02:57.616 --> 00:03:00.463\nMost of it will be pre-done for you.\n\n61\n00:03:00.463 --> 00:03:06.223\nAnd well, the whole goal is to focus on\nbundling this up into a Docker image so\n\n62\n00:03:06.223 --> 00:03:11.458\nwe can ship that off to Docker Hub and\nthen deploy that as a container.\n\n63\n00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:13.600\nWe're gonna start very simply though.\n\n64\n00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.820\nSo let's take a look at index.js.\n\n65\n00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.350\nAnd all it's going to say is\nconsole.log('Running on NodeJS!.');.\n\n66\n00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.360\nOkay, well what does that mean?\n\n67\n00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.990\nI don't know anything about Node.\n\n68\n00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.646\nWell, if I just run this on my computer,\nI have Node installed on my computer.\n\n69\n00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:32.392\nIt just prints it out running on Node.js.\n\n70\n00:03:32.392 --> 00:03:35.957\nWell, that's great, but\nif you can install it on your computer,\n\n71\n00:03:35.957 --> 00:03:38.959\nwhy would we ever even care\nabout building a container?\n\n72\n00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.786\nWell, the fact being is every time I\nwanted to deploy this application,\n\n73\n00:03:44.786 --> 00:03:49.030\nI would need to make sure that I provision\nsome Linux server, either a VM or\n\n74\n00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.848\nan EC2 instance, or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n75\n00:03:51.848 --> 00:03:55.764\nDo all the setup and\nmake sure Node's installed, and\n\n76\n00:03:55.764 --> 00:03:58.470\nthen actually set up to run, right?\n\n77\n00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.530\nI have to expose it on port 80 in order\nto make it available on the Internet.\n\n78\n00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.860\nAnd it's just a lot of work.\n\n79\n00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.700\nAnd this manual maintenance, this set up,\n\n80\n00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.100\nthis tendency kind of\naggregation is a nightmare.\n\n81\n00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.310\nAs someone who has actually\ndone that from time to time,\n\n82\n00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.510\nsetting up Apache servers and\nstuff, it is not fun time.\n\n83\n00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.550\nSo I like the Docker ecosystem\nbecause it makes this easy.\n\n84\n00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.350\nYou do it one time and you're done.\n\n85\n00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.956\nNow what we need to do is build\na Dockerfile that takes this and\n\n86\n00:04:24.956 --> 00:04:26.732\nputs it kind of all together.\n\n87\n00:04:26.732 --> 00:04:29.099\nWe're gonna start simply and\nmake sure that it runs and\n\n88\n00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:30.660\nlook through a few commands.\n\n89\n00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.840\nBut I think there's no better time than\nnow to start building up that Dockerfile.\n\n90\n00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.090\nSo you can use any text editor you want.\n\n91\n00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.432\nI'm using Vim, or VI is available to you.\n\n92\n00:04:42.432 --> 00:04:45.142\nNano or Adam or any of those,\nbut this is just so\n\n93\n00:04:45.142 --> 00:04:48.840\nyou don't get a little motion\nsick as I swipe between screens.\n\n94\n00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.790\nAnd it slows me down a little bit and\nkeeps me honest.\n\n95\n00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.260\nSo what am I gonna do?\n\n96\n00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.430\nWell, I know from my experience\nthat I know a great deal.\n\n97\n00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.070\nWell, when I say a great deal,\nI know a fair amount\n\n98\n00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.280\nabout Debian-based Linux distributions,\nthat well,\n\n99\n00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.950\nI can provision a great deal of servers\nand I can get Node running fairly quickly.\n\n100\n00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.040\nI will forewarn you, on Docker Hub, there\nis a Node.js platform already available.\n\n101\n00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.662\nI can say from Node.js, and\n\n102\n00:05:18.662 --> 00:05:23.800\nit will pull a Docker image that already\nhas Node installed and everything.\n\n103\n00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.881\nI'm gonna go through this to show you,\nwell, what if I'm not running or\n\n104\n00:05:26.881 --> 00:05:29.473\nsomething that it already has\nthat available to me, right?\n\n105\n00:05:29.473 --> 00:05:33.408\nMaybe it's some weird JVM language\nthat keeps cropping up and\n\n106\n00:05:33.408 --> 00:05:35.764\nI'm building this application in.\n\n107\n00:05:35.764 --> 00:05:37.453\nI need to know how to do this.\n\n108\n00:05:37.453 --> 00:05:39.870\nSo we're starting from a base Linux.\n\n109\n00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.660\nAnd then we're gonna build up our runtimes\nso our application will be there.\n\n110\n00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.550\nAll right, so starting with Ubuntu,\n\n111\n00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.880\nthat's my base image,\nI'm going to issue a few run commands.\n\n112\n00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.940\nAnd the first one is apt get update -y.\n\n113\n00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.070\nMake sure you put that -y in\nthere because if you don't,\n\n114\n00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.230\nit's gonna say, are you sure?\n\n115\n00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.311\nAnd then your build's gonna fail.\n\n116\n00:05:59.311 --> 00:06:04.031\nAnd then I'm going to\nrun apt get install if I\n\n117\n00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:08.505\ncan spell apt get appropriately, curl.\n\n118\n00:06:08.505 --> 00:06:10.843\nAlso gonna issue a -y.\n\n119\n00:06:10.843 --> 00:06:14.239\nOkay, well-\n&gt;&gt; Kind of a silent install thing you got\n\n120\n00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:14.852\ngoing on.\n\n121\n00:06:14.852 --> 00:06:16.434\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n122\n00:06:16.434 --> 00:06:21.311\n&gt;&gt; Typically if you're doing anything with\naptitude, you're definitely gonna have\n\n123\n00:06:21.311 --> 00:06:26.185\na -y or a -f or something, where there's\nno prompts that require you to interact,\n\n124\n00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:28.580\nbecause the Docker build will fail.\n\n125\n00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.070\nAnd we've seen that in previous episodes.\n\n126\n00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.400\nBut this is a reminder,\n\n127\n00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.280\ncuz this was a point of frustration when\nI first started playing around with this.\n\n128\n00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.950\nNow with that said, notice that I'm\nkeeping these on separate lines.\n\n129\n00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.473\nWhen I'm done, I would probably move\nthis all into a single run command, or\n\n130\n00:06:44.473 --> 00:06:46.888\nat least start pushing these together.\n\n131\n00:06:46.888 --> 00:06:50.190\nBut I'm utilizing\nthe cache as separate runs.\n\n132\n00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.958\nThat way,\nif I need to change this line, well,\n\n133\n00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.606\nthen that's the only\nline that has to rerun.\n\n134\n00:06:55.606 --> 00:06:59.230\nWell, and anything after that\nbecause the cache has changed.\n\n135\n00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.910\nAll right, so now that I have curl, well,\nI'm gonna type some things here and\n\n136\n00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:04.950\nthen we're gonna talk\nabout what they're doing.\n\n137\n00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.103\nSo I'm gonna run\n\n138\n00:07:09.103 --> 00:07:13.728\ncurl -sl, https://\n\n139\n00:07:13.728 --> 00:07:21.665\ndeb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x.\n\n140\n00:07:21.665 --> 00:07:23.720\nAnd then I'm gonna pipe that to bash.\n\n141\n00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:30.589\nAnd finally, well, finally for\nnow, finally for now,\n\n142\n00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:38.350\nwe are going to say, apt-get install\nnodejs and add a -y to that as well.\n\n143\n00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.670\nAll right, we're gonna test this.\n\n144\n00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.210\nI'm not gonna move any further with\nactually building an application for\n\n145\n00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.900\nnow because we wanna make\nsure that this builds.\n\n146\n00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.888\nAnd this is a great way to\nthink about Docker images.\n\n147\n00:07:47.888 --> 00:07:52.960\nIf your runtime doesn't exist, let's say\nthat Node didn't exist on Docker Hub,\n\n148\n00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.027\nwell, I could build this image,\nsave it to my Docker Hub account.\n\n149\n00:07:57.027 --> 00:08:00.972\nAnd then use it as the base image,\nfor another Docker file.\n\n150\n00:08:00.972 --> 00:08:06.359\nAnd I can then inherit this setup that I'm\ncreating for the respective [CROSSTALK].\n\n151\n00:08:06.359 --> 00:08:09.087\n&gt;&gt; So no reinventing the wheel once\nyou've got the, just like you like it,\n\n152\n00:08:09.087 --> 00:08:10.352\nyou bake that cookie perfectly.\n\n153\n00:08:10.352 --> 00:08:13.237\nYou can redo the recipe over and\nover again with just a copy and\n\n154\n00:08:13.237 --> 00:08:14.266\npaste kind of thing.\n\n155\n00:08:14.266 --> 00:08:17.159\n&gt;&gt; Right, and\nactually it even gets simpler than that.\n\n156\n00:08:17.159 --> 00:08:21.950\nThis FROM command here,\nbecomes instead of FROM ubuntu,\n\n157\n00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.905\nit becomes in this case, justindevpro/\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n158\n00:08:25.905 --> 00:08:27.940\n&gt;&gt; Node, so they're not gonna\nuse that as a base image.\n\n159\n00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.260\nSo we're gonna see that.\n\n160\n00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.399\nOne final thought here.\n\n161\n00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:34.974\nIn recent versions, apt-get,\nyou can actually shorten that to apt for\n\n162\n00:08:34.974 --> 00:08:36.474\nthe Aptitude manager,\n\n163\n00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:41.661\nyou will get some weird errors about not\nbeing TTY compliant and all these things.\n\n164\n00:08:41.661 --> 00:08:45.598\nSo I tend to use with apt-get, even though\nwhen I'm messing around in Linux I make\n\n165\n00:08:45.598 --> 00:08:49.095\nsure that I command to apt,\njust because I don't like typing apt-get.\n\n166\n00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:52.047\nBut in Dockerfiles you\nget little warnings about\n\n167\n00:08:52.047 --> 00:08:54.786\nnot having appropriate outputs sometimes.\n\n168\n00:08:54.786 --> 00:08:55.878\nSo leave it there.\n\n169\n00:08:55.878 --> 00:08:58.037\nSo let's go ahead and save this.\n\n170\n00:08:58.037 --> 00:09:02.596\nI did not mean to get out of it, though.\n\n171\n00:09:02.596 --> 00:09:04.776\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I did saved it.\n\n172\n00:09:04.776 --> 00:09:05.418\n&gt;&gt; Old habits, right?\n\n173\n00:09:05.418 --> 00:09:05.983\n&gt;&gt; Old habits.\n\n174\n00:09:05.983 --> 00:09:09.330\nBut this one command\nhere was kind of weird.\n\n175\n00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.229\nLike where would I,\nhow would I know this, right?\n\n176\n00:09:12.229 --> 00:09:15.541\nHow do I know to type this,\nJustin, you just made that up.\n\n177\n00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:16.403\nNo, I didn't.\n\n178\n00:09:16.403 --> 00:09:20.361\nI had to look this up because this is\nwhere my node run time comes from.\n\n179\n00:09:20.361 --> 00:09:22.954\nAnd I was working on Ubuntu.\n\n180\n00:09:22.954 --> 00:09:25.909\nSo let's go take a look\nwhere did that come from.\n\n181\n00:09:25.909 --> 00:09:31.683\nAnd let's go to Google and\ntype, node.js ubuntu.\n\n182\n00:09:31.683 --> 00:09:35.709\nNow this could of easily been Fedora,\nor Red Hat or Cent.\n\n183\n00:09:35.709 --> 00:09:39.518\nAnd Installing Node js\nvia package manager.\n\n184\n00:09:39.518 --> 00:09:45.030\nAnd here is the list of all\nthese distributions here.\n\n185\n00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.367\nArch, Debian based,\nEnterprise Linux, Fedora.\n\n186\n00:09:48.367 --> 00:09:51.743\nSome of these I don't know, and even\nWindows, yeah, which is kind of weird,\n\n187\n00:09:51.743 --> 00:09:54.249\ncuz I don't think of Windows\nas having package managers,\n\n188\n00:09:54.249 --> 00:09:56.213\nbut it does have a couple\nof third party ones.\n\n189\n00:09:56.213 --> 00:09:57.373\n&gt;&gt; Better late than never, right?\n\n190\n00:09:57.373 --> 00:09:58.451\n&gt;&gt; That is exactly right.\n\n191\n00:09:58.451 --> 00:10:01.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna stay with the Debian.\n\n192\n00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:06.366\nAnd notice, here's that command,\nkinda, kinda.\n\n193\n00:10:06.366 --> 00:10:10.514\nHere's that command here that\nI've put into my Dockerfile.\n\n194\n00:10:10.514 --> 00:10:12.937\nAnd what this does is it grab a setup.\n\n195\n00:10:12.937 --> 00:10:18.272\nIt adds a key, it adds it to your\nlist of repositories for apt-get.\n\n196\n00:10:18.272 --> 00:10:22.630\nAnd then I have the ability to\napt-get install In your Dockerfile,\n\n197\n00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.928\nyou could use the package manager.\n\n198\n00:10:24.928 --> 00:10:29.975\nYou could also use wget or\ncURL to download the binary, and\n\n199\n00:10:29.975 --> 00:10:34.816\nthen you use your package manager,\nwhether BEM or DNF or\n\n200\n00:10:34.816 --> 00:10:40.074\napt or whatever to install from\nthat Debian package, okay?\n\n201\n00:10:40.074 --> 00:10:43.413\nAnd I think misspoke there,\nthey're a little bit different,\n\n202\n00:10:43.413 --> 00:10:47.828\nnot quite the package manager there but\nlike a, your Debian packaging resources.\n\n203\n00:10:47.828 --> 00:10:53.108\nI don't recommend that because if you\ngo to rebuild this, like let's say that\n\n204\n00:10:53.108 --> 00:10:58.080\nnode has an update, this update will\nstay current with node version six.\n\n205\n00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.318\nOtherwise I'm gonna have to change\nthe URL for the actual binary, so\n\n206\n00:11:02.318 --> 00:11:06.423\nI tend to use package managers in\nmy Docker build files where I can.\n\n207\n00:11:06.423 --> 00:11:11.485\nSo if we notice here though, Daniel,\ndo you see anything that's a little\n\n208\n00:11:11.485 --> 00:11:15.991\nodd from this command that's\nhighlighted to this command here?\n\n209\n00:11:15.991 --> 00:11:19.745\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nyou're definitely missing that sudo -E.\n\n210\n00:11:19.745 --> 00:11:21.573\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sudo -E's not there.\n\n211\n00:11:21.573 --> 00:11:23.823\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So, and then a sudo here, and\n\n212\n00:11:23.823 --> 00:11:25.051\njust as a reminder,\n\n213\n00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:29.551\nwhen you're doing a Docker build you\nalready have elevated privileges.\n\n214\n00:11:29.551 --> 00:11:32.369\nSo if you go to look, right?\n\n215\n00:11:32.369 --> 00:11:36.439\nI needed to add this node source\nto the Debian package manager.\n\n216\n00:11:36.439 --> 00:11:39.389\nAnd then I have to get\nsudo apt-get installed.\n\n217\n00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:43.161\nOkay, well, if you type sudo,\nyour Docker build will fail.\n\n218\n00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:45.463\nSo keep that in mind, be very careful.\n\n219\n00:11:45.463 --> 00:11:49.590\nYou're already elevated at what\nyou can do inside of a Dockerfile.\n\n220\n00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:52.705\nDon't need sudo,\njust run it and let it rip.\n\n221\n00:11:52.705 --> 00:11:55.632\n&gt;&gt; Think Node Js with Pink and\na little addendum there on their website,\n\n222\n00:11:55.632 --> 00:11:59.231\nletting you know if you're doing this in\nDocker, forget that whole sudo business.\n\n223\n00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:01.684\n&gt;&gt; Well, maybe they just make\nan assumption that, well,\n\n224\n00:12:01.684 --> 00:12:05.188\nif you're doing anything in Docker,\nyou don't need the sudo business at all.\n\n225\n00:12:05.188 --> 00:12:06.696\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And that's for\n\n226\n00:12:06.696 --> 00:12:08.267\nthe most part-\n&gt;&gt; It's also an implied thing.\n\n227\n00:12:08.267 --> 00:12:08.862\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so.\nSo\n\n228\n00:12:08.862 --> 00:12:13.770\nI'm going to actually run an appropriate\ncommand and my Dockerfile's done.\n\n229\n00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.128\nWe're gonna test this before we\nstart building our application.\n\n230\n00:12:16.128 --> 00:12:20.451\nWell, because I wanna make sure that\nthe actual run time is built up.\n\n231\n00:12:20.451 --> 00:12:25.387\nSo docker build -t, and\nusing our naming convention,\n\n232\n00:12:25.387 --> 00:12:28.124\nthis is my Docker Hub profile.\n\n233\n00:12:28.124 --> 00:12:33.505\nAnd /, I wanna call this node base,\nbecause then I would be able to do,\n\n234\n00:12:33.505 --> 00:12:39.812\nfrom justindevpro/node:base, and\nthen build another Docker image from that.\n\n235\n00:12:39.812 --> 00:12:42.997\nThat's very handy, and\nI'm gonna build from here.\n\n236\n00:12:42.997 --> 00:12:47.153\nSo, running the build context and\nrunning apt-get update.\n\n237\n00:12:47.153 --> 00:12:50.283\nNow sadly,\nI've done a little bit of research, and\n\n238\n00:12:50.283 --> 00:12:54.696\nI've said this in a previous episode but\njust as a reminder apt-get is for\n\n239\n00:12:54.696 --> 00:12:57.698\nsome reason painfully slow\non the initial build.\n\n240\n00:12:57.698 --> 00:13:02.792\nThat's why you should utilize\nthe caching system for your Dockerfiles.\n\n241\n00:13:02.792 --> 00:13:06.649\nSo it will take a little while,\nand this is not nearly as fast.\n\n242\n00:13:06.649 --> 00:13:08.248\nI mean it's still pretty fast, but\n\n243\n00:13:08.248 --> 00:13:11.515\nit's not nearly as fast as it would\nbe if you're in a base Linux install.\n\n244\n00:13:11.515 --> 00:13:16.674\nAnd I think that's getting a little better\nfrom previous iterations that I've seen,\n\n245\n00:13:16.674 --> 00:13:20.150\nbut now because I'm running cURL and\nthis is up and going-\n\n246\n00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.277\n&gt;&gt; It's updating, it's gonna take a bit.\n\n247\n00:13:22.277 --> 00:13:23.446\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n248\n00:13:23.446 --> 00:13:27.016\nSo we're utilizing those\nindividual run commands to\n\n249\n00:13:27.016 --> 00:13:29.563\nminimize this on subsequent builds.\n\n250\n00:13:29.563 --> 00:13:32.727\nSo running apt-get installed in Node.js,\nand\n\n251\n00:13:32.727 --> 00:13:35.435\nwe just have to give\nit little bit of time.\n\n252\n00:13:35.435 --> 00:13:37.830\nNow, why we're giving it some time.\n\n253\n00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.428\nWell, I-\n&gt;&gt; You gave it enough time.\n\n254\n00:13:39.428 --> 00:13:40.321\n&gt;&gt; I gave it enough time.\n\n255\n00:13:40.321 --> 00:13:43.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But before we do, just as a reminder,\n\n256\n00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.863\nthis application is going to run and\nquit as soon as we actually build it up.\n\n257\n00:13:47.863 --> 00:13:52.130\nAnd because I've used these\nindividual run commands,\n\n258\n00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:55.306\nI don't have to worry about that taking so\n\n259\n00:13:55.306 --> 00:14:00.042\nmuch time to rebuild because I\nhave these individual layers.\n\n260\n00:14:00.042 --> 00:14:03.840\nSo now that I have my base image,\nI know that it works.\n\n261\n00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:08.382\nOkay, let's actually put\nthis into our Dockerfile.\n\n262\n00:14:08.382 --> 00:14:12.899\nSo if I hop back into my\nDockerfile right after I apt-get\n\n263\n00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:16.657\ninstall Node.js, well, what do I wanna do?\n\n264\n00:14:16.657 --> 00:14:19.064\nI have that index.js file.\n\n265\n00:14:19.064 --> 00:14:22.324\nThat's actually what I want to run,\nall right?\n\n266\n00:14:22.324 --> 00:14:27.727\nSo I'm gonna stay here and\nwell, there's a couple of ways.\n\n267\n00:14:27.727 --> 00:14:28.755\nAnd I'm gonna show you one and\n\n268\n00:14:28.755 --> 00:14:31.524\nthen we're gonna look at the documentation\nto see what the recommendation is.\n\n269\n00:14:31.524 --> 00:14:40.104\nI'm going to add index.js to\na folder inside of my image, right?\n\n270\n00:14:40.104 --> 00:14:46.110\nThen this will be evident in\nthe container, called /app/index.js.\n\n271\n00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:51.060\nNow do use file extensions here, because\nindex.js, if I just left this at /app,\n\n272\n00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:55.514\nit would actually take that file and\nrename it as a folder or it would try to,\n\n273\n00:14:55.514 --> 00:14:57.518\nand then you get some weirdness.\n\n274\n00:14:57.518 --> 00:14:59.713\nNot that I've done that before-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n275\n00:14:59.713 --> 00:15:01.740\n&gt;&gt; But definitely, I'd be aware of-\n\n276\n00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:02.309\n&gt;&gt; The word on the street is.\n\n277\n00:15:02.309 --> 00:15:03.739\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I've heard.\n\n278\n00:15:03.739 --> 00:15:10.690\nSo I'm gonna add index.js to the image\nat /app/index.js, all right.\n\n279\n00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:15.537\nAnd then I'm gonna do one other thing,\nand we're gonna come back to this add\n\n280\n00:15:15.537 --> 00:15:19.192\ncommand cuz there's a,\nit could be a little iffy there.\n\n281\n00:15:19.192 --> 00:15:22.341\nI'm gonna set the working\ndirectory to /app,\n\n282\n00:15:22.341 --> 00:15:27.234\nand that means where is your container\ngoing to start based on this image?\n\n283\n00:15:27.234 --> 00:15:31.232\nSo if I were to Docker\nrun-IT this container,\n\n284\n00:15:31.232 --> 00:15:35.853\nthis would actually put me\nin this folder by default.\n\n285\n00:15:35.853 --> 00:15:40.360\nSo I can set where the container starts\nby default by using this WORXDIR.\n\n286\n00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.854\nNow we haven't seen this previously, but\n\n287\n00:15:41.854 --> 00:15:43.980\nthis is important as you're\nbuilding these applications.\n\n288\n00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.465\nAnd then finally we need,\nwe'll how is this going to start?\n\n289\n00:15:47.465 --> 00:15:49.550\nHow are we gonna start this up?\n\n290\n00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:52.273\nAnd we're just gonna go with the command,\nbecause maybe this wants to be,\n\n291\n00:15:52.273 --> 00:15:55.101\nthen we want this to be over-runnable,\nor overridable, over-runnable.\n\n292\n00:15:55.101 --> 00:15:58.000\nOverridable, and\n\n293\n00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.623\nwe're gonna say node, Index.js.\n\n294\n00:16:03.623 --> 00:16:06.697\nAll right, now I'm gonna come back and\n\n295\n00:16:06.697 --> 00:16:10.870\nmess this up a little bit,\nhopefully this works.\n\n296\n00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.810\nWe're assuming this works and\nafter it does,\n\n297\n00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:16.300\nwe're gonna mess it up a little bit and\nsee how things play out.\n\n298\n00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.980\nSo I'm gonna run that Docker build again.\n\n299\n00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:23.570\nBut instead of saying base as my image,\nI'm going to say,\n\n300\n00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:30.542\nnodeapp, actually I'm gonna call\nthis nodeapp:1.0, all right.\n\n301\n00:16:30.542 --> 00:16:34.275\nSo I'm calling this\njustindevpro/nodeapp:1.0 and I'm still\n\n302\n00:16:34.275 --> 00:16:38.392\nbuilding from the same directory,\nI'm just tagging this image a little bit\n\n303\n00:16:38.392 --> 00:16:43.380\ndifferently, just so I can, I know that\nit's different than that node base image.\n\n304\n00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.457\nSo I rerun, that was fast.\n\n305\n00:16:45.457 --> 00:16:46.450\n&gt;&gt; Super fast.\n\n306\n00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:47.345\n&gt;&gt; Super fast.\n\n307\n00:16:47.345 --> 00:16:48.690\n&gt;&gt; Because I don't have to re-update.\n\n308\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:50.580\nAll those other\nintermediate containers and\n\n309\n00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:54.930\nimages already existed from\nthe previous build of node base.\n\n310\n00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.960\nSo now all I had to do was\nre-run from this add command.\n\n311\n00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.630\nThe moment of truth though, does it run?\n\n312\n00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:05.489\nWell, let's find out,\ncuz I'm not infallible,\n\n313\n00:17:05.489 --> 00:17:07.928\nit may have went horribly awry.\n\n314\n00:17:07.928 --> 00:17:12.299\nSo I'm gonna node run justindevpro and\n\n315\n00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:16.406\nthat was nodeapp:1.0 and boom,\n\n316\n00:17:16.406 --> 00:17:23.810\nI have now bundled up an index.js\nfile into a docker container.\n\n317\n00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:27.090\nWell, it's actually part of an image but\nI ran a container and\n\n318\n00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:31.650\nit printed out just like it\nwould on my laptop previously.\n\n319\n00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:35.237\nWell, that's great cuz I didn't have to,\nif I'm putting this on a brand new server,\n\n320\n00:17:35.237 --> 00:17:37.710\nI don't have to worry about\ninstalling node on the server.\n\n321\n00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:40.710\nI just have to make sure that\nthe image is set up to run and\n\n322\n00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:42.350\nthen that docker is installed in server.\n\n323\n00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:46.397\nAnd it's getting so\nubiquitous that docker is,\n\n324\n00:17:46.397 --> 00:17:50.948\nit's almost a one click\ninstall in a lot of instances.\n\n325\n00:17:50.948 --> 00:17:56.142\nBut, as a matter of experimentation,\nI wonder what happens if I just,\n\n326\n00:17:56.142 --> 00:18:00.918\nyou know what, I'm not even gonna,\nI'm just gonna take it out.\n\n327\n00:18:00.918 --> 00:18:02.230\nYeah, just take it out.\n\n328\n00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:09.786\nSo, let's see here and I'm gonna\nrerun 1.0 and it's still pretty fast.\n\n329\n00:18:09.786 --> 00:18:11.225\n&gt;&gt; So it's successfully built.\n\n330\n00:18:11.225 --> 00:18:16.300\n&gt;&gt; It says successfully built,\nhm, but does it successfully run,\n\n331\n00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.116\nthose are two different things\nthat we have to be careful about.\n\n332\n00:18:19.116 --> 00:18:24.785\nSo docker run justindevpro\n\n333\n00:18:24.785 --> 00:18:30.220\nnodeapp:1.0 and.\n\n334\n00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:30.900\n&gt;&gt; You broked it.\n\n335\n00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.360\n&gt;&gt; I broked it.\n\n336\n00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:37.330\nIt does give me standard error,\nin this case standard out,\n\n337\n00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.651\nfor Cannot find module '/index.js'.\n\n338\n00:18:40.651 --> 00:18:41.957\nWhy is that?\n\n339\n00:18:41.957 --> 00:18:46.517\nWell, if I go and\nlook in my Docker file I added\n\n340\n00:18:46.517 --> 00:18:50.600\nindex.js to a folder in the container.\n\n341\n00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:55.585\nI did not anyway indicate that I should\nbe looking in that folder to try to run\n\n342\n00:18:55.585 --> 00:18:56.940\nthat application.\n\n343\n00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:03.150\nAnd with a lot of web apps and\nthings of that nature, it's really handy\n\n344\n00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:06.990\nto assume that your app is running\nfrom the folder that contains it.\n\n345\n00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:10.610\nJust for logistics purposes, and\nyou don't always have to worry about\n\n346\n00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.180\ncreating absolute or\nat least relative paths.\n\n347\n00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:18.000\nSo that's where that WORKDIR comes in.\n\n348\n00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.580\nI am setting the working directory for\nthis application.\n\n349\n00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:26.180\nAnd now if we go back and run,\nthat should be, well, don't run, but\n\n350\n00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.650\ngo back and build,\nthat's important, gotta rebuild.\n\n351\n00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:33.800\nIf we go back and build, and then I run,\nnotice it's back to working.\n\n352\n00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.050\n&gt;&gt; So if you take that work there,\nthat working dir or\n\n353\n00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:41.040\nwhatever it was out of there, it's going\nto fall back to some sort of default\n\n354\n00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.980\nwhich is the actual directory that\nyou're in at that moment in time.\n\n355\n00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:44.600\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and\n\n356\n00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.870\nif I'm not mistaken in Ubuntu, it is\nthe root directory is where it defaults.\n\n357\n00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.920\nSo this will all be top level and\nthen you'll be adding things to\n\n358\n00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.490\nthe root directory, but\nnow this is a sub-directory.\n\n359\n00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:00.510\nOne thing to keep in mind though,\nthis application, or excuse me,\n\n360\n00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:04.180\nthis image is now kind of\ncoupled to the application.\n\n361\n00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:07.910\nThis is not how I would go about\nthis if I was using this image for\n\n362\n00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:09.200\ndevelopment environment.\n\n363\n00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.950\nThis is how I would put this\ntogether as an application to\n\n364\n00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:15.170\nsend off to Docker HUB that has\nsome kind of build process or\n\n365\n00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:18.810\ndeployment process that would\nautomatically deploy changes.\n\n366\n00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:19.740\nNow before we move on,\n\n367\n00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:24.020\nthere's a couple of others things that\nI wanna change there before we move on.\n\n368\n00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.070\nBecause when I say application,\nall it's doing is printing to the screen.\n\n369\n00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.890\nI want to talk about that add command.\n\n370\n00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:34.980\nLet's hop over into, well,\nlet's say dockerfile reference.\n\n371\n00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:38.040\nAnd this will be your friend,\nI recommend keeping up on this.\n\n372\n00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:42.160\nThey've gotten pretty good about keeping\nthis up to date as the version changes.\n\n373\n00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.335\nAnd if we look here notice we're on 17.03.\n\n374\n00:20:45.335 --> 00:20:49.570\nThat's the version that's installed on\nmy computer so make sure those match.\n\n375\n00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.420\nIf you don't,\nthey have a drop down of older versions.\n\n376\n00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.010\nBut I'm gonna zoom out\njust a little bit and\n\n377\n00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:58.840\nif I look over here notice\nthere's this ADD command.\n\n378\n00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:05.950\nSo ADD has two forms,\nmultiple source and then,\n\n379\n00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:13.440\nso excuse me source and destination,\nand then the list type form.\n\n380\n00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.120\nAnd okay, well, that's good.\n\n381\n00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.829\nAnd then if we scroll down\nwe'll come back, Copy.\n\n382\n00:21:19.829 --> 00:21:25.836\nWell Copy kinda looks like the same thing,\ncopy from source to destination.\n\n383\n00:21:25.836 --> 00:21:30.194\nIt even gives you very similar examples,\nthat's weird.\n\n384\n00:21:30.194 --> 00:21:35.052\nSo why would I,\nwhat difference would I use?\n\n385\n00:21:35.052 --> 00:21:39.634\nHere's the standard difference,\nADD allows you to point to URLs and\n\n386\n00:21:39.634 --> 00:21:44.100\nother things that it will try\nto download and put in there.\n\n387\n00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.540\nCopy is for directories and files.\n\n388\n00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:51.031\nThat is the recommendation.\n\n389\n00:21:51.031 --> 00:21:54.800\nIf I can find it here, let's go down and,\n\n390\n00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.870\nno, no, wait a minute,\nI'm on the wrong page.\n\n391\n00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:04.925\nSo Docker file ad versus copy and\nif we look docker file add versus copy but\n\n392\n00:22:04.925 --> 00:22:11.100\nwhat we really want is best practices for\nwriting docker files.\n\n393\n00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:15.390\nI don't know why that escaped me\nat that very moment so if I add or\n\n394\n00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:19.728\ncopy there is a recommendation\nof when to use which one.\n\n395\n00:22:19.728 --> 00:22:24.650\nAlthough add and copy are functionally\nsimilar, copy is preferred.\n\n396\n00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:28.830\nSo if you've been using old docker,\nthis is not always the case, and\n\n397\n00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:31.110\nyou will see docker files\nin the wild that use add.\n\n398\n00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:34.990\nI just used it, it works,\nit works as I anticipated.\n\n399\n00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:39.850\nHowever based on the docker file\nbest practices, copy is preferred,\n\n400\n00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:43.140\nthat's because it's more\ntransparent than add.\n\n401\n00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:46.970\nCopy only supports basic copying from\nyour local computer into the image,\n\n402\n00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:51.530\nadd will actually,\nif its a Tar file it will expand it.\n\n403\n00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:55.830\nIt will actually untar it, well that maybe\nunexpected because maybe you expected it\n\n404\n00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:59.160\nto be a Tar file,\nthat your using in your application.\n\n405\n00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.640\nIt will also look for,\nlike I said, URLs and\n\n406\n00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:09.140\ntry to bring in the associated resource\nfrom a web-based URL and put it in there.\n\n407\n00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.740\nThat may be handy but it's not\ntransparent about what it's doing.\n\n408\n00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:16.490\nI would be, I have this tar file or\nthis zip file and\n\n409\n00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:21.360\nif it's untarred I may be in trouble\nas far as my application's going.\n\n410\n00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:26.800\nSo with that said, we should probably\nchange our Docker file really quickly.\n\n411\n00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.680\nAnd then let's actually\nbuild a true replication.\n\n412\n00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:35.919\nSo, Looking into those resources,\n\n413\n00:23:35.919 --> 00:23:40.417\nI'm going to change ADD to COPY and\nit should still work.\n\n414\n00:23:40.417 --> 00:23:44.116\nWe're using the documentation, but let's\nsee if we run into one of those gotchas.\n\n415\n00:23:44.116 --> 00:23:49.492\nDocker build and I'm gonna write\n\n416\n00:23:49.492 --> 00:23:56.600\nover nodeapp: 1.0, and it looks fine.\n\n417\n00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.114\nAnd then, if we rerun.\n\n418\n00:23:58.114 --> 00:24:04.710\nEverything works the same so\nI recommend using copy as well.\n\n419\n00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:09.881\nPeriodically I'll get in some old\nbad habits, or I'll be using another\n\n420\n00:24:09.881 --> 00:24:15.720\nDockerfile for a reference but\nyou should really use copy, not add.\n\n421\n00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.234\nNow Daniel,\nthere's some other things that go on it,\n\n422\n00:24:18.234 --> 00:24:21.890\ndo you think we have time to actually\nbuild this full scale application?\n\n423\n00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:24.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\ncuz I know how good Justin is.\n\n424\n00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.410\nHe can make that happen in the six\nminutes that we have left on the clock,\n\n425\n00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:28.960\nso fire away my good man.\n\n426\n00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.649\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, let's-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n427\n00:24:30.649 --> 00:24:31.588\n&gt;&gt; Let's find out,\n\n428\n00:24:31.588 --> 00:24:35.154\nso I'm gonna hop over into nodeappv1,\nand all I'm gonna do is make\n\n429\n00:24:35.154 --> 00:24:38.906\na copy because that Dockerfile is gonna\nbe very similar to what we have so\n\n430\n00:24:38.906 --> 00:24:40.850\nwe can see that difference.\n\n431\n00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:44.176\nSo I'm gonna say nodeappv1/dockerfile and\n\n432\n00:24:44.176 --> 00:24:50.590\nwhere am I going to copy that to,\nwell nodeoppv2, that kinda makes sense.\n\n433\n00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:55.952\nAnd if I hop into nodeoppv2 with\nappropriate naming, there we go.\n\n434\n00:24:55.952 --> 00:25:01.342\nAnd I ls, you'll notice\nthere's this extra file here,\n\n435\n00:25:01.342 --> 00:25:04.673\nand index.js, and the Dockerfile.\n\n436\n00:25:04.673 --> 00:25:09.368\nOkay well let's take a look\nat not the Dockerfile,\n\n437\n00:25:09.368 --> 00:25:14.389\nbut the Node index.js and\nwell, this is a full blown,\n\n438\n00:25:14.389 --> 00:25:19.520\nwell full blown,\nit is in a web based application server\n\n439\n00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:24.420\nusing Express which is\npart of the Node runtime.\n\n440\n00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:29.240\nNow this is very standard,\nit's not even the most up to date version\n\n441\n00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:33.520\nthat Node can handle as far as\nthe JavaScript version, but it works and\n\n442\n00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.800\njust to show you let's take\na look at what this is doing.\n\n443\n00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.820\nSo I have to npm install,\nthat's important, and you should, every\n\n444\n00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:46.080\ntime you're making these applications\nwork like this you should be thinking\n\n445\n00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.457\nwhat are the steps I need to take, because\nthose have to be in your Dockerfile cuz\n\n446\n00:25:49.457 --> 00:25:53.488\nDocker's not gonna make any assumption\nabout how to make this application work.\n\n447\n00:25:53.488 --> 00:25:58.658\nSo node index.js, I'm now on port 8080,\nlet's take a look.\n\n448\n00:25:59.809 --> 00:26:03.923\nAnd 8080, and all it says is welcome,\nall right, so\n\n449\n00:26:03.923 --> 00:26:09.180\nthat's what it does, but it is a start\non how to build this application.\n\n450\n00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:12.690\nSo let's kill it.\n\n451\n00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:15.320\nAnd well, what is this other file?\n\n452\n00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:19.373\nNotice that node_modules is there,\nthose are just dependencies,\n\n453\n00:26:19.373 --> 00:26:21.340\nwe don't have to worry about it.\n\n454\n00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:27.220\nThe same would be for Python, for\nGo, actually Go builds a binary,\n\n455\n00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:32.140\nfor Java, anything that has to be pulled\nin, well, you have similar steps.\n\n456\n00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.420\nBut what's this package.json?\n\n457\n00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.170\nAnd this is what the Node runtime uses for\nsaid dependencies.\n\n458\n00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:43.490\nSo this file is kind of, along with\nother things, kind of like a list of\n\n459\n00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:46.720\nthings that I need in my application for\nmy application to run.\n\n460\n00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.630\nThis is probably something good to\ninclude in this Dockerfile, right?\n\n461\n00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:55.940\nIf I bring that list of dependencies\nthrough, then that Dockerfile can actually\n\n462\n00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:00.500\nbuild them and become part of the Docker\nimage that I'm trying to release.\n\n463\n00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.560\nSo those are two things,\nagain not necessarily about Node,\n\n464\n00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:07.900\nthis is something that you should be aware\nof for whatever programming language or\n\n465\n00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:13.190\nwhatever runtime you're using,\nwhat pieces do I need to make happen?\n\n466\n00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:17.150\nSo let's go ahead and\nsay Dockerfile, all right.\n\n467\n00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:20.312\nWell, I copied index.js, right,\n\n468\n00:27:20.312 --> 00:27:25.412\nI just told you you needed\nthat package.json file, okay,\n\n469\n00:27:25.412 --> 00:27:30.314\nso let's add a COPY package.json,\nand put that in app.\n\n470\n00:27:32.629 --> 00:27:38.366\nApp.package.json, and package.json is\nkind of a default feature of Node,\n\n471\n00:27:38.366 --> 00:27:40.601\nit knows to look for that file.\n\n472\n00:27:40.601 --> 00:27:46.763\nAnd now that I've copied those,\nbefore I can do this nodeindex.js,\n\n473\n00:27:46.763 --> 00:27:53.145\nyou'll remember it gave me an error\nuntil I ran that npm install, okay.\n\n474\n00:27:53.145 --> 00:27:56.778\nWell this is one of those\nkind of application specific,\n\n475\n00:27:56.778 --> 00:28:01.950\nyou'll have to figure out what\nis needed for your application.\n\n476\n00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.310\nSo I'm gonna npm install but\nnotice I'm inside the directory, so\n\n477\n00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:09.440\nI skipped over that after I copied cuz\nI need to be inside that directory\n\n478\n00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.489\ncuz this install command is looking for\nthis package.json file.\n\n479\n00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:19.020\nWe will in future episodes look at other\nlanguages, just so it's not very specific.\n\n480\n00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:22.824\nSo if now I run, or excuse me, build.\n\n481\n00:28:24.653 --> 00:28:29.024\nJustindevpro/nodeapp and this is 2.0, so\n\n482\n00:28:29.024 --> 00:28:32.416\nI'm tagging those appropriately.\n\n483\n00:28:32.416 --> 00:28:34.186\nAnd then it's building, it's building.\n\n484\n00:28:34.186 --> 00:28:39.918\nAnd then this npm install is very much\nlike a package management system for,\n\n485\n00:28:39.918 --> 00:28:44.320\nwell, just for\nNode instead of the actual Linux runtime.\n\n486\n00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.293\nIt says it's built,\nlet's see what happens.\n\n487\n00:28:47.293 --> 00:28:53.619\nSo docker run dash, well we wanna\nmake sure we bind the ports so\n\n488\n00:28:53.619 --> 00:28:58.863\nwe can check to see if\nthe application's running.\n\n489\n00:28:58.863 --> 00:29:03.299\nAnd justindevpro/nodeapp:2.0 and\n\n490\n00:29:03.299 --> 00:29:06.849\nnow listening on port 8080.\n\n491\n00:29:09.018 --> 00:29:15.124\nHere we go, the moment of truth,\nand if I come back there we go,\n\n492\n00:29:15.124 --> 00:29:18.828\nit says that I've made a get request.\n\n493\n00:29:18.828 --> 00:29:23.279\nI refresh, it looks like everything's\nworking exactly the same,\n\n494\n00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:25.787\nit doesn't seem any different to me.\n\n495\n00:29:25.787 --> 00:29:29.736\nBut now I don't have to worry about do\nI have a node installed on my server,\n\n496\n00:29:29.736 --> 00:29:31.646\nI can just run this as a container and\n\n497\n00:29:31.646 --> 00:29:36.230\nas long as I do a little bit of the setup\nwith the ports I should be good to go.\n\n498\n00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:37.633\nSo let's go ahead and kill this.\n\n499\n00:29:40.491 --> 00:29:42.500\nNo, Daniel, we're in trouble.\n\n500\n00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:43.375\n&gt;&gt; You broke it again?\n\n501\n00:29:43.375 --> 00:29:45.131\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I broke it again, and Daniel,\n\n502\n00:29:45.131 --> 00:29:48.506\nI don't know if we have time to\nsolve this problem on this episode.\n\n503\n00:29:48.506 --> 00:29:52.236\n&gt;&gt; Well, that's a nice little cliffhanger\nto leave our lovely viewing audience with.\n\n504\n00:29:52.236 --> 00:29:56.036\nSo you'll have to come back, we'll roll\nthis into a part two and see we have it\n\n505\n00:29:56.036 --> 00:30:00.260\nworking but we can't make it stop working,\nwhich is an interesting problem to have.\n\n506\n00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:04.220\nSo I look forward to seeing what\nthe resolution to that conflict is.\n\n507\n00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:06.700\nJustin, thanks for\ngetting us this far, very cool stuff.\n\n508\n00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.330\nAnd we do thank you for watching,\nbut it's time to sign off.\n\n509\n00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:11.440\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n510\n00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.850\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Justin Dennison.\n\n511\n00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.154\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next

00:00:38,796\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,796 --> 00:00:41,587\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Shawn Orian.\n\n5\n00:00:41,587 --> 00:00:42,712\nHow ya doing Shawn?\n\n6\n00:00:42,712 --> 00:00:43,837\n>> Not too bad how are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:43,837 --> 00:00:44,379\n>> Fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:45,046\nFantastic.\n\n9\n00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:48,245\nGlad to be here and\nsuper excited to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:53,074\nWe are starting up episode number\ntwo in our CEH episodes and to,\n\n11\n00:00:53,074 --> 00:00:56,671\ntoday, we're gonna be\ngoing over cryptography.\n\n12\n00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,490\nSo a lot of things we're gonna talk about,\ncryptography, cryptography obviously\n\n13\n00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,171\na very important part of you know,\nkeeping our information confidential.\n\n14\n00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:08,623\nMaking sure that unauthorized people are\nnot gaining access to that information.\n\n15\n00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:11,421\nSo where do we wanna\nstart with cryptography?\n\n16\n00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:14,929\n>> Well, to start with cryptography, it's\nprobably important to kind of at least,\n\n17\n00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:17,046\nyou know,\nset the stage on what cryptography is.\n\n18\n00:01:17,046 --> 00:01:20,675\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So let, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n19\n00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:25,348\nCryptography is really just one portion\nof knowledge that deals with how to\n\n20\n00:01:25,348 --> 00:01:30,393\nprotect information as well as how to\nverify the integrity of information,\n\n21\n00:01:30,393 --> 00:01:34,421\nso it's, it's dealing with you know,\nthose two things.\n\n22\n00:01:34,421 --> 00:01:39,203\nMost people are familiar with the\nscrambling and unscrambling of data, which\n\n23\n00:01:39,203 --> 00:01:44,212\nis the, the encryption decryption part,\nbut there's much more to it than that.\n\n24\n00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:49,410\nSo we kinda gotta explore,\nyou know, what that means to us.\n\n25\n00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:54,115\nI always like to emphasize when I talk\nabout cryptography, we are gonna be using\n\n26\n00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:59,312\ntechnology in here to illustrate to\nillustrate what, how cryptography works\n\n27\n00:01:59,312 --> 00:02:04,046\nand how to apply it, but cryptography is\nbeen around for ages and ages and ages.\n\n28\n00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:08,385\nSo we're gonna kind of take a look at some\nof those historic ones not just to give\n\n29\n00:02:08,385 --> 00:02:12,167\nyou a trip down memory lane, [LAUGH] but\nalso because some of the older ones\n\n30\n00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:15,701\nare simple enough to illustrate\nthe points of cryptography but\n\n31\n00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:19,174\nthey not only do they illustrate\nthe points of cryptography,\n\n32\n00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:21,421\nthey also give us a nice\nsimple way to do it.\n\n33\n00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:24,060\nYou know, you don't have to get\nsome big complex thing where we're\n\n34\n00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,772\nin a lab coat and\nsketching on a white board or\n\n35\n00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:26,379\nsomething-\n>> Yeah.\n\n36\n00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,047\n>> We don't want to do that.\n\n37\n00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,830\n>> Right, exactly.\nWe wanna explain cryptography, but\n\n38\n00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,400\nwe don't wanna require you to have an,\nan engineering or\n\n39\n00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,254\nmathematical degree in order\nto understand the explanation.\n\n40\n00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,917\nSo we can use some of those simple\nalgorithms or even go back further before\n\n41\n00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:41,805\nit was even mathematical to explain the\nconcepts, because it, it still applies,\n\n42\n00:02:41,805 --> 00:02:44,913\nit's just that it's gotten more\nadvanced with our technology and\n\n43\n00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:46,546\nthe power that we have available.\n\n44\n00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:49,254\nWe can do a lot more than just\nrotate 13 letters, right?\n\n45\n00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:50,546\n[LAUGH]\n>> E, exactly.\n\n46\n00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,621\nWe, we've got a lot of\nthings on the table,\n\n47\n00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:56,322\nlot of things on the menu that we can use\nto actually encrypt and decrypt stuff,\n\n48\n00:02:56,322 --> 00:02:58,754\nso we're,\nwe're gonna take a look at all of that.\n\n49\n00:02:58,754 --> 00:02:59,504\n>> Good, good.\n\n50\n00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:00,004\nI'm excited.\n\n51\n00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:01,379\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n52\n00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,379\nSo you know, first of all, you know,\nwhy do we, why even have cryptography?\n\n53\n00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:05,337\nWhat, what's the whole point?\n\n54\n00:03:05,337 --> 00:03:06,379\nWhy do I need it?\n\n55\n00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:10,055\n>> Well, there's plenty of reasons\nwe could pull out on why you wanna\n\n56\n00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:13,446\nuse cryptography, but, you know,\nprobably the biggest reason is,\n\n57\n00:03:13,446 --> 00:03:17,254\nit's a, it's a good way of protecting\nthe confidentiality of information.\n\n58\n00:03:17,254 --> 00:03:22,129\nYou know, one of the, one of the key or\ncore things that we have in security.\n\n59\n00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:27,138\nYou know, if you wanna keep pry, you know,\nprying or curious eyes out of you know,\n\n60\n00:03:27,138 --> 00:03:30,715\nlooking at your business this\nis a great way to do it.\n\n61\n00:03:30,715 --> 00:03:35,710\nAs such, it's used in many of the areas\nthat we will be talking about, you know,\n\n62\n00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,587\nin the, in and around this whole course.\n\n63\n00:03:38,587 --> 00:03:41,213\n>> Yeah, we've mentioned that\nfirst episode, the, the CIA triad.\n\n64\n00:03:41,213 --> 00:03:43,137\nRight?\nConfidentiality, integrity and\n\n65\n00:03:43,137 --> 00:03:46,296\navailability, that first leg\nbeing that confidentiality.\n\n66\n00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:47,671\n>> Boom.\nRight there.\n\n67\n00:03:47,671 --> 00:03:51,837\nThat's a, that's a very, very important\narea where it play, where it plays a role.\n\n68\n00:03:51,837 --> 00:03:55,027\nYou know, so, and all and then you\nhave and so, you have a lot of, a,\n\n69\n00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:55,962\na, need to do that.\n\n70\n00:03:55,962 --> 00:03:56,712\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n71\n00:03:56,712 --> 00:04:01,153\n>> In fact, some of the tax we'll see\nlater on in this, in this course,\n\n72\n00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:03,833\nyou will see things like sniffing and\n\n73\n00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:08,026\nsession hijacking just to name,\njust to name a couple.\n\n74\n00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:11,504\nThose can be defeated by using\nthings such as cryptography.\n\n75\n00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:12,004\n>> All right.\n>> Yes.\n\n76\n00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:13,194\n>> And, and, and, you know,\n\n77\n00:04:13,194 --> 00:04:15,377\nas our technologies progress and,\nand, you know,\n\n78\n00:04:15,377 --> 00:04:17,087\nit use to be the secret to Coca-Cola.\n\n79\n00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:17,786\nRight?\nIt's kept\n\n80\n00:04:17,786 --> 00:04:21,491\nin a safe somewhere in some building and,\nand only if you knew that combination or\n\n81\n00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:25,379\ncould break that safe could you get in,\nbut now our data's stored electronically.\n\n82\n00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:27,705\nIt's, it's on these systems,\nit's on these networks and\n\n83\n00:04:27,705 --> 00:04:29,087\nall of our networks are connected.\n\n84\n00:04:29,087 --> 00:04:32,228\nAnd so with the right equipment and\nthe right skill set, you know,\n\n85\n00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:35,594\npeople can find their way in and\nthat cryptography's getting us that,\n\n86\n00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:37,129\nthat another layer of defense.\n\n87\n00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:40,127\nWe always talk about layers of defense and\nsecurity and,\n\n88\n00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:43,129\nand I think cryptology is just a,\nanother layer to that.\n\n89\n00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:44,129\n>> Absolutely.\n\n90\n00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:48,463\nIn fact, you could go as far to say,\nin a number of cases if we didn't have\n\n91\n00:04:48,463 --> 00:04:53,250\nthe technology do, to do en, encryption,\ndecryption and even hashing.\n\n92\n00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,007\nA lot of the technologies that\nwe have nowadays just wouldn't\n\n93\n00:04:57,007 --> 00:04:58,462\nexist in the same form.\n\n94\n00:04:58,462 --> 00:04:58,962\n>> Yeah, e-commerce.\n\n95\n00:04:58,962 --> 00:05:01,953\nI mean, I'm not gonna put my credit card\nnumber on some website if you can't tell\n\n96\n00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:04,462\nme that that information's gonna\nbe encrypted as it travels across\n\n97\n00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:05,046\nthe internet.\n\n98\n00:05:05,046 --> 00:05:07,017\nRight?\nSo, it just wouldn't exist,\n\n99\n00:05:07,017 --> 00:05:07,962\nonline banking.\n\n100\n00:05:07,962 --> 00:05:10,254\n>> Yeah, or at least it wouldn't\nexist in its, in its current form.\n\n101\n00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:10,837\n>> Yeah.\n\n102\n00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:13,337\n>> They would have had to find something,\nsome other way to do it.\n\n103\n00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:14,791\n>> All right.\n>> Which is you know,\n\n104\n00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,087\nwe don't really have\na great alternative to it.\n\n105\n00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:19,732\n>> Right. [LAUGH] >> You know,\ncryptography does the job so well and\n\n106\n00:05:19,732 --> 00:05:23,421\nit's been so versatile that we don't\nreally need to find another way to do it.\n\n107\n00:05:23,421 --> 00:05:26,264\n>> Right.\n>> So that's you know, kind of gives a,\n\n108\n00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:28,587\nat least one reason why it's used.\n\n109\n00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:31,629\nAnother reason why it's used\nis the integrity aspect.\n\n110\n00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:34,729\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Which is, really, solely the domain of,\n\n111\n00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:35,629\nof hashing.\n\n112\n00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:38,148\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, hashing is used to verify,\n\n113\n00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:43,060\nto verify that, you know, whether or\nnot information has stayed the same or\n\n114\n00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,837\nit has been modified and\nwe're gonna see just how that works.\n\n115\n00:05:46,837 --> 00:05:50,202\nYou know, I've got some demos lined\nup here for you to show you that and\n\n116\n00:05:50,202 --> 00:05:52,350\nreally kinda get your eyeballs on it.\n\n117\n00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:57,306\nThe thing you wanna remember is that,\nwhy encryption and decryption are used\n\n118\n00:05:57,306 --> 00:06:02,046\nto protect confidentiality of information,\nhashing doesn't do that.\n\n119\n00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:05,421\nHashing does just integrity,\nyour information is still readable.\n\n120\n00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:08,911\n>> That's one of the things I think that\nif people really struggle with sometimes,\n\n121\n00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:12,558\nbecause we talk about hashing along with\nall the other encryption methodology and,\n\n122\n00:06:12,558 --> 00:06:14,171\nand it really does encrypt the data.\n\n123\n00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:15,395\nRight?\nYour data goes in,\n\n124\n00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:18,795\nit runs through this mathematical\nprocess and the output is a, a hash and\n\n125\n00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,379\nwe'll talk more about hashing.\n\n126\n00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,398\nBut you get your hash value or\nas, as a result, but\n\n127\n00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:26,041\nthe original data is still there and\nreadable.\n\n128\n00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,421\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n129\n00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:30,411\n>> So, it's not giving you anything for\nconfidentiality, but\n\n130\n00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:33,879\nchange one little character in there and,\nand I can tell immediately.\n\n131\n00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,046\n>> Exactly.\n\n132\n00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:37,961\nSo that's, that's,\nthat's the value of that and, and, and\n\n133\n00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:39,379\nwe're gonna see all this-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n134\n00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:42,815\n>> To kind of make sure that we really,\nyou know, again,\n\n135\n00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:47,921\nget our eyeballs out to see exactly what\nthat means to use one over the other.\n\n136\n00:06:47,921 --> 00:06:52,688\nNow there's two additional things that,\nthat that cryptography aids us in doing\n\n137\n00:06:52,688 --> 00:06:57,667\nand that is doing authentication just\nabout every authentication mechanism you\n\n138\n00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,837\nuse out there in some way, shape or\nform, employs cryptography.\n\n139\n00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:02,880\nNot all of them.\n\n140\n00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,171\nNot all of them, but a lot of them do.\n\n141\n00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:09,810\nAnd so that's an important thing and we're\ngonna see that when we start talking about\n\n142\n00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,629\ndigital signatures or you know,\nfor a, as one case of that.\n\n143\n00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:17,078\nAnd then we also have something\nthat's very important to us,\n\n144\n00:07:17,078 --> 00:07:20,691\ncryptography plays a role in\nwhat they call non-repudiation.\n\n145\n00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:25,689\nNon-repudiation is important, because it\nallows us to say to definitively say,\n\n146\n00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:27,254\nwho carried out an action.\n\n147\n00:07:27,254 --> 00:07:31,962\nAnd now most of us are familiar with\nthat in terms of digital signatures.\n\n148\n00:07:31,962 --> 00:07:36,764\nIf you digitally sign something it\nmeans that once you digitally sign it,\n\n149\n00:07:36,764 --> 00:07:41,587\nwe know by virtue of it being your digital\nsignature it came, it came from you.\n\n150\n00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:45,174\nYou know, so, if you say, well,\nI didn't send that, either you're lying or\n\n151\n00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:48,671\nsomeone got a hold of your signature and\nthen we've got a problem either way.\n\n152\n00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:49,254\n>> Absolutely.\n\n153\n00:07:49,254 --> 00:07:50,758\n>> You know, so that's, that, that,\n\n154\n00:07:50,758 --> 00:07:54,004\nthose are some of the important things to\nremember about what cryptography does.\n\n155\n00:07:54,004 --> 00:07:57,813\nCryptography doesn't just do one thing,\nit can do a multitude of things.\n\n156\n00:07:57,813 --> 00:08:01,214\n>> So we see that it gives us that, that\nconfidentiality that we're looking for.\n\n157\n00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,316\nIt gives us the integrity that we need.\n\n158\n00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,431\nAnd allow those to give us the non\nrepudiation, the tying of the originator\n\n159\n00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:11,300\nwith that data, and it gives us\nthe ability to, what was the last one?\n\n160\n00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,830\n>> Authenticate.\n\n161\n00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,640\n>> Authentication,\n\n162\n00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,940\nbig part of authentication is\ngonna be the cryptography as well.\n\n163\n00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,060\nSo, lots of uses for cryptography, and\n\n164\n00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,490\nas you said at the beginning of\nthe episode, it's not like this is new.\n\n165\n00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,670\nIt's been around,\nI think some of the books I've read say,\n\n166\n00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,080\nit's been around since man had secrets.\n\n167\n00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,190\nYou know, maybe even before the written\nword, and things like that.\n\n168\n00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:35,250\nSo, it's nothing new, it's just changed\nin the way we've implemented it\n\n169\n00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,496\nover the years, so,\nit's been around for awhile.\n\n170\n00:08:37,496 --> 00:08:43,325\n>> Yeah, there's actually been cases made\nsaying that since man started rendering\n\n171\n00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:49,420\nideas, even in cave paintings, that there\nwas a need for some form of cryptography.\n\n172\n00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,078\nTo write something that only, your group\nunderstand or your clan understood, and\n\n173\n00:08:54,078 --> 00:08:58,150\nif we go back far enough you'll say\nwhere the best hunting grounds were.\n\n174\n00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,680\nYou wanted your people to have\nthe advantage, not the other guy.\n\n175\n00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,985\n>> Right, all of a sudden somebody\nelse getting that information and\n\n176\n00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:03,899\ntaking all the good game.\n\n177\n00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,477\nAnd I think in your book you talk about\nthe, the Egyptians and the hieroglyphs and\n\n178\n00:09:07,477 --> 00:09:09,912\nhow you can almost look at\nthat as a form of encryption.\n\n179\n00:09:09,912 --> 00:09:13,001\nBecause if you're part of the royalty or\nthe upper echelon,\n\n180\n00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:17,001\nyou weren't taught to read those and\nthen you couldn't understand it, and so\n\n181\n00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:21,260\nonly if somebody would decipher or read it\nto you, would you get that information.\n\n182\n00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,410\nSo that is a form of cryptography,\ncuz we're keeping,\n\n183\n00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,800\nit's that confidentiality, right?\n\n184\n00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,990\nIf you can't decipher it, you can't\nread it, you don't have the information.\n\n185\n00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,530\n>> Exactly.\n\n186\n00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,910\n>> So, been around for a long time.\n\n187\n00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,743\n>> Long, long time.\n\n188\n00:09:32,743 --> 00:09:38,620\n>> [LAUGH] All right so\nwe've talked about why we need it.\n\n189\n00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,790\nWe've got the confidentiality, integrity,\nauthentication, non-repudiation.\n\n190\n00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,990\nWe know it's been around for\nas long as we can remember,\n\n191\n00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,030\nall the way back to the Egyptians and\nprior to that.\n\n192\n00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,140\nAnd so it's important that we understand\nthe different methods of cyber-hackers.\n\n193\n00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,525\nThere are several different ways we can\ngo about applying cryptography, right?\n\n194\n00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:03,470\n>> Yeah,\nthere's plenty of ways that you can do it.\n\n195\n00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:08,060\nTo kind of look at some of, to kind of\nmix it in with the historic uses and\n\n196\n00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,460\nthe applications that it had\nkinda shows you how it's evolved.\n\n197\n00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,940\nSo in the earliest stuff we have that\nwe still see in use today is stuff like\n\n198\n00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,480\nthe Caesar cipher, which is a simple\nsubstitution cipher, and we are going to,\n\n199\n00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,680\nyou know, I'm going to demo that for you,\nso just hold on if you haven't seen that.\n\n200\n00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,030\nI'm gonna give you a look at that one, so\n\n201\n00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:33,560\nthat one was used by Julius Caesar,\nthat's where it got its name.\n\n202\n00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,065\nWho also makes an interesting salad,\ntoo, just in case you're wondering.\n\n203\n00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:38,819\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, but what Julius Caesar did, and\n\n204\n00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:43,191\nI'll just use the English language\nas an example of this because we\n\n205\n00:10:43,191 --> 00:10:48,162\ndon't know-\n>> [LAUGH] Latin's a little rusty.\n\n206\n00:10:48,162 --> 00:10:49,440\n[LAUGH]\n>> You guy's know it, right?\n\n207\n00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,376\nCome on.\nSo, but\n\n208\n00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:54,057\nwhat happened is when\nJulius Caesar used this,\n\n209\n00:10:54,057 --> 00:10:59,672\nhe just shifted his letters and\nhis messages threee spaces to the right,\n\n210\n00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:05,029\nand when someone got it they need to\nshift it three spaces to the left.\n\n211\n00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:09,043\nAnd that's how he sent messages to\nhis commanders in the field and so,\n\n212\n00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:13,860\nwe have an example there again of trying,\nof keeping information confidential.\n\n213\n00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,860\nYou wouldn't want someone\nelse to have that.\n\n214\n00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,910\n>> So he knew there was a chance that\nthat messenger could be intercepted,\n\n215\n00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,340\nI mean his battle and things like that,\nbut if they got that message.\n\n216\n00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,470\nit just looks like gobbledygook.\n\n217\n00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,040\nThey have no idea what it\nsays because they would know\n\n218\n00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,600\nto shift it back three letters.\n\n219\n00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,355\n>> Exactly, and there's just a lot of\nthings that are reason why it worked well.\n\n220\n00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:33,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n221\n00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,470\n>> And they still use that to,\nthey definitely still use that today.\n\n222\n00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:43,395\nAnd you mentioned shifting 13 spaces.\n\n223\n00:11:43,395 --> 00:11:44,070\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Rot 13.\n\n224\n00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,070\n>> The Rot 13 yeah.\n\n225\n00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,700\n>> That's the substitution cipher, and\n\n226\n00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,795\nthat's in the same family\nas the Caesar cipher.\n\n227\n00:11:49,795 --> 00:11:50,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n228\n00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,840\nthat was used a lot on, early BBSes.\n\n229\n00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,920\nI don't know if you know that or not.\n\n230\n00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,496\n>> Oh, oh, yeah.\nYep.\n\n231\n00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:57,172\n>> They used it on early BBSes, and for\n\n232\n00:11:57,172 --> 00:12:01,290\nthose of you too young to know\nwhat a BBS is, look it up.\n\n233\n00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Before we had HTML, guys.\n\n234\n00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,285\n>> Yeah.\nGet off my lawn.\n\n235\n00:12:04,285 --> 00:12:09,450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, if you're, but, in the early days,\n\n236\n00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:14,560\nwhen they put stuff on BBSes,\nthere was one of the, if people posted,\n\n237\n00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,580\none of the big places they used, it was,\npeople posted like, dirty jokes and stuff.\n\n238\n00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,450\nThey put, they encrypt it using ROT 13,\nsaying they shifted every letter\n\n239\n00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,340\nthrough 13 spaces to the right, and\nthey figured okay, if you saw it and\n\n240\n00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:32,200\nsaw it was like that, and\nyou knew what the way to decode it,\n\n241\n00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,783\nand they figured if you decoded it,\nyou knew what you were getting into.\n\n242\n00:12:35,783 --> 00:12:36,740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, so\n\n243\n00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,771\nthat was one of the uses of it,\nnot the most glamorous use, I'll admit,\n\n244\n00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:46,160\nbut it was kind of an interesting\nlittle piece of trivia there.\n\n245\n00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,850\n>> Yeah, but it does,\n\n246\n00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,100\nwith the cryptography is really in\nevery aspect of what we do nowadays.\n\n247\n00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,740\nLike you were saying, so many different\nplaces we see it, and so many things that\n\n248\n00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,854\nwe just wouldn't have or wouldn't be the\nsame if we didn't have this technology.\n\n249\n00:13:00,854 --> 00:13:07,015\nIt's evolved tremendously,\nit's a fascinating thing to look at,\n\n250\n00:13:07,015 --> 00:13:12,115\nfrom the early days, like Caesar cipher,\nto the Civil War, to Beignet Cypher\n\n251\n00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,700\nto World War II, with the Enigma machine-\n>> The Enigma, yeah.\n\n252\n00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,905\n>> That the Germans used.\n\n253\n00:13:18,905 --> 00:13:20,570\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I mean, they're just, Germans and\n\n254\n00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,730\nJapanese, as a matter of fact.\n\n255\n00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,575\nAnd to today's environment.\n\n256\n00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:25,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We have,\n\n257\n00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,690\nyou know, a lot of really cool things\nthat we're doing in cryptography.\n\n258\n00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,490\nAnd then they're even talking next\ngeneration with cryptography, which is\n\n259\n00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:37,250\nquantum Cryptography, which is where\nthey're doing, they use quantum physics,\n\n260\n00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,820\nand something called quantum entanglement,\n>> Looking at the Q-bit, and\n\n261\n00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,860\nthe phase of the rotation of these things,\nor something.\n\n262\n00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,400\n>> Yeah, they're looking at subatomic\nparticles, and how they're linked,\n\n263\n00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,180\nI could explain it to you, but\nit's just not cool to do that, you know?\n\n264\n00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,260\nSo. [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH] I started\nreading one of those white papers, and\n\n265\n00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,000\nI think part of my brain had an aneurysm,\njust, boom!\n\n266\n00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,920\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's very cool,\n\n267\n00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,445\ninteresting stuff, but it's not something\nthat you need to know, don't worry.\n\n268\n00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:04,055\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that would be really messed up.\n\n269\n00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:05,830\n>> [LAUGH] That would, that would.\n\n270\n00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,410\nAll right so\nyou know we know cryptography,\n\n271\n00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:11,010\nkind of what it is and\nsome of the historical uses for it, so\n\n272\n00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,500\nlet's start breaking down some of\nthe different types of cryptography.\n\n273\n00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,360\n>> Okay.\n\n274\n00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:15,950\nThis is great.\n\n275\n00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,700\nWhen you look at different\ntypes of cryptography,\n\n276\n00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,190\nthere's two major types that we need\nto talk about right off the bat.\n\n277\n00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:26,660\nAnd that's symmetric cryptography and\nasymmetric cryptography.\n\n278\n00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:33,825\nThose deal specifically with\nencrypting and decrypting information,\n\n279\n00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:40,055\nor what we call plain text to cipher text,\nand cipher text back to plain text.\n\n280\n00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:45,035\nPlain text is anything that hasn't gone\nthrough the meat grinder of encryption and\n\n281\n00:14:45,035 --> 00:14:50,015\ncipher, or plain text is what comes out,\nis what goes in,\n\n282\n00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,140\ncipher text is what comes out, you know.\n\n283\n00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,440\nSo that's what the two is and\nyou will see those terms used a lot.\n\n284\n00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,470\n>> Yeah,\nthose are really good terms to know.\n\n285\n00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,660\nSo again, just to reiterate that,\nyour plain text is human readable, right?\n\n286\n00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,820\nThat's the information\nthat I want to protect.\n\n287\n00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,520\nAnd in its current state,\nanybody can read it.\n\n288\n00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,250\nIf I run it through some encryption\nalgorithm, the output of that is gonna be\n\n289\n00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,230\nmy cipher text or my encoded text,\nwhich is not human readable.\n\n290\n00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,990\nAnd without the proper key or\ndekeying, or decrypting information,\n\n291\n00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,110\nyou're not going to be able to get\nthat original message back out.\n\n292\n00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,600\nSo plain text human readable, cipher text,\n\n293\n00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,610\nyou need some more information to\nbe able to access that information.\n\n294\n00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,160\n>> Exactly.\n\n295\n00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,720\nSo symmetric, and\nasymmetric are the two encryption and\n\n296\n00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,560\ndecryption types that convert plain\ntext into cipher text and back.\n\n297\n00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,980\nThen we have something called hashing.\n\n298\n00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,020\nAnd hashing is, as I mentioned before,\nhashing is another type of doing.\n\n299\n00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,600\nof applying the principles\nof cryptography.\n\n300\n00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,870\nExcept it deals in a different area.\n\n301\n00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,320\nYou know, so\nthose are your three main types.\n\n302\n00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,151\nUnderneath that,\nwe have things like substitution ciphers,\n\n303\n00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:02,693\ntransposition ciphers, and\nthen they even go through and\n\n304\n00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:06,998\nsometimes classify them as classic\nciphers and modern ciphers.\n\n305\n00:16:06,998 --> 00:16:11,741\nThe classic ciphers would be stuff\nlike your, it would be stuff like your\n\n306\n00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:18,139\nsymmetric Systems and modern ones would\nbe stuff like your asymmetrical ones too.\n\n307\n00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:20,322\nYou know, so, and\nthen we also have block and\n\n308\n00:16:20,322 --> 00:16:24,120\nstream which is how it deals with stuff\nunderneath the hood for the algorithm.\n\n309\n00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,070\nAll right, so let, let's start then\nwith some symmetric cryptography and\n\n310\n00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,300\nthe terms symmetric to me, and\nthe first thing that I think of Symmetric,\n\n311\n00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,460\nI think back to like biology, you know,\nand the same on both sides, or being able\n\n312\n00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:42,140\nto fold something in half, I have an exact\ncopy of it so, when we talk about\n\n313\n00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,900\ncryptography, and symmetric cryptography,\nwe're really talking about that key right.\n\n314\n00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,600\n>> Yes.\n\n315\n00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,580\nI, it's the,\nthe key is an important thing.\n\n316\n00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,430\nLet, let's, so let's talk about that.\n\n317\n00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,390\nFor the first let's,\n\n318\n00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,790\nlet's really discuss what a key-\n>> Okay, very good.\n\n319\n00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,370\n>> Actually is.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n320\n00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,410\n>> It's probably important to\n[LAUGH] to get, to get through.\n\n321\n00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,510\nSo you know, bef, let's,\nlet's back up a bit.\n\n322\n00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,485\nAnd kinda, and say so we know what\nplain text and cypher text is.\n\n323\n00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:06,280\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n324\n00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,240\n>> We got an algorithm\n>> 'Kay, an algorithm is a formula\n\n325\n00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,960\nthat describes, you know,\nhow encryption is, is gonna take place.\n\n326\n00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,250\nYou know, what the process is for\n\n327\n00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:21,040\ntransforming it from one format\nto another, and back if need be.\n\n328\n00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,160\nSo, that's,\nthat's the significance of that,\n\n329\n00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,170\nand there's a lot of ways you\ncan instruct an algorithm.\n\n330\n00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,100\n>> Hm.\n>> And algorithms,\n\n331\n00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,160\ninterestingly enough, are, probably aren't\nas complex as you think they might be.\n\n332\n00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,970\nYou know, people expect to see, you know,\nsome guy with some wild hair and\n\n333\n00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,850\na lab coat scribbling on a board,\nand it just doesn't work that way.\n\n334\n00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,120\n>> Right.\n>> You know, having a whole wall full of,\n\n335\n00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,060\nyou know, nu, numbers and\nblah, blah, blah back there.\n\n336\n00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,740\nThat's not efficient to use in a computer-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n337\n00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,940\n>> No matter how good your computer is,\n\n338\n00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,330\nit's just not that efficient.\n\n339\n00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,580\nSo we, you, you know, your,\nyour algorithms could be very, very,\n\n340\n00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,150\nvery short and insignificant.\n\n341\n00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,710\nYou could look at them and go, that's it?\n\n342\n00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,130\n>> That's what-\n>> You know, that's what baffling me?\n\n343\n00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,290\n>> That's what's protecting my data,\nreally?\n\n344\n00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:56,910\n>> Yeah.\n\n345\n00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,120\nYeah, it's, it's, it can be really,\n\n346\n00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,710\nreally, so, like really simple but\nthey are can be tremendously effective.\n\n347\n00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,170\n>> Right.\n>> You know, so the, so there's that.\n\n348\n00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,260\nAnd they got some really smart\npeople working on this stuff.\n\n349\n00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:07,875\nSo.\n\n350\n00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,550\n>> [LAUGH] But, but there's only so\nmany algorithms out there, right?\n\n351\n00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,150\n>> That, that, that we can use,\nand, and it, it's like.\n\n352\n00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,260\nThere's this, one of the things, you know,\n\n353\n00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,100\nwhen we're first getting into crypt,\ncryptography you find that, you know,\n\n354\n00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,850\nthere's, there's, there's several of them,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n355\n00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,250\nThere's a lot of algorithms out there,\nbut when it comes down to it, if,\n\n356\n00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,830\nif we're using the same algorithm,\nthe same formula To encrypt my data.\n\n357\n00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,680\nIf I know the formula you're using,\nor the algorithm that, you're,\n\n358\n00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,025\nyou're using, why can't I just\nreverse it and get your data back out?\n\n359\n00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:36,050\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n360\n00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:39,300\nThat, and, and that's the, that's\nthe thing is that you can understand how\n\n361\n00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,240\nan algorithm wor, algorithm works,\nin fact, there's something in cryptography\n\n362\n00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,230\ncalled Kerckhoffs' Principle-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n363\n00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,360\n>> Which says that you\ncan publish an algorithm\n\n364\n00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,310\n>> And scrutinize the whole thing, and\n\n365\n00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,150\nthat's a good idea.\n\n366\n00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,265\nIt's kind of like the same\nconcept as open source.\n\n367\n00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,550\n>> Um-hm.\n>> You know that it's a lot you\n\n368\n00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,130\ncan scrutinize if you want.\n\n369\n00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,310\nThe reality is,\nthese algorithms that're, that you can,\n\n370\n00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:03,632\nyou can look at, most of probably\naren't gonna get it you know.\n\n371\n00:19:03,632 --> 00:19:06,670\n[LAUGH] The reality is, you know,\nI can sit there and go, yeah,\n\n372\n00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,790\nI can see some stuff happening.\n\n373\n00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,230\nI don't know what's going on.\n\n374\n00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,130\nI just know it works.\n\n375\n00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,450\nThere's people a lot smarter\nthan me that can do that.\n\n376\n00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,540\nBut, I can look at the algorithm.\n\n377\n00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,550\nThe other thing that's,\nthat we have to keep in mind.\n\n378\n00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,000\nWhen we're talking about something\ncalled Kerckhoffs's principle,\n\n379\n00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,700\nwe can look at the algorithm, but\nwe can't we keep the key secret.\n\n380\n00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,910\nThe key is the important thing.\n\n381\n00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,030\nAn algorithm defines How many potential\ndoes a lot of things, one of the things it\n\n382\n00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,775\ndefines is the key space, saying how\nmany potential keys you can have.\n\n383\n00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:34,400\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n384\n00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,390\n>> And that could be huge,\nit's mind numbingly huge.\n\n385\n00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,530\nYou know, the human, the human\nbrain really only grasps numbers,\n\n386\n00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:46,350\naccurately grasps numbers up to about\n100 or 150, after that it's just,\n\n387\n00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,960\nit's just, it's blah, it's a,\nit's a bunch of stuff.\n\n388\n00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,920\nIf you talk about something like\nthe caesar cyphers applied to\n\n389\n00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,656\nthe English language,\nyou're talking twenty-seven possible keys.\n\n390\n00:19:56,656 --> 00:19:59,710\nCuz you've got 26 letters in\nthe alphabet so one through 26 and\n\n391\n00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,510\nthen you add zero cause you don't\nhave to do anything at all,\n\n392\n00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,210\nyou could leave it how you see it\nYou know so, 27 possible keys.\n\n393\n00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,290\nThat's not a big key space.\n\n394\n00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,700\nNow if you look at something like A-yes\n\n395\n00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,270\nthe common example just to\nkinda help us visualise it.\n\n396\n00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:19,170\nIs to say if you dug a trench from,\nlike Sacramento to Los Angeles, which\n\n397\n00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:23,710\nis about 450 miles, if you dug a trench\nthat long and made it a mile wide and\n\n398\n00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,130\na mile deep, and filled it full of ping\npong balls, and during this process,\n\n399\n00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,800\nyou took one ping pong ball, painted it\nred, and chucked it in there, you know,\n\n400\n00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:37,660\njust at random and said, that represents\nthe correct key to undo a lock,\n\n401\n00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,910\nyou know how long would it take you to\nfind or do a key spacers to find it?\n\n402\n00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,180\nStatistically, it could be\nthe first thing you find.\n\n403\n00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,570\n>> Right.\n>> So, statistically,\n\n404\n00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,680\nit could be the very last one you pull\nout of that trench after everything's all\n\n405\n00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,890\nsaid and done.\n\n406\n00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,900\nBut either way, you're gonna have to pack\na lunch, because it's gonna take a while.\n\n407\n00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,140\n>> Yes.\n>> You're probably gonna have to clear out\n\n408\n00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,350\nsome aspect of that tren, or some amount\nof that trench before you find it.\n\n409\n00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,200\nNow, if you were, were relying\non being able to get that key,\n\n410\n00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,490\nto get that information,\nbecause it was very important to you,\n\n411\n00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,260\nIt's probably not gonna be valuable\nto you by the time you find it.\n\n412\n00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,180\nYou know, case and point is, is the,\nis the enigma machine from World War II.\n\n413\n00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,740\nIt was able to be broken by the Allies,\n\n414\n00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,030\ncuz they found defects in the system and\nhad inside knowledge of it.\n\n415\n00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,170\nIf they use traditional brute force\nmethods, they found that, there's\n\n416\n00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:27,410\nmessages that the, on the, on one of the\nnego machines that had five reels in it.\n\n417\n00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:32,060\nThey were actually able to break it in\nabout 2004 using brute force techniques.\n\n418\n00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,460\n>> Huh.\n>> That was the piece of information you\n\n419\n00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,430\nwere relying on to win the war.\n\n420\n00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,976\nYou've got a problem.\n\n421\n00:21:35,976 --> 00:21:37,086\n>> [LAUGH] A little too late, isn't it?\n\n422\n00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:38,490\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's a little late.\n\n423\n00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,340\nYou know, we're not saying we're not\nsaying that algorithms are unbreakable.\n\n424\n00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,730\nWe're just saying it's gonna be\nit's gonna be tough to break.\n\n425\n00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:49,220\n>> And then so the larger\nthe key space on that algorithm,\n\n426\n00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,070\nthe more difficult it should be to,\nto break or the, potentially the longer.\n\n427\n00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,100\nLike you said, though, nothing to say\nthey get it on the first try, but\n\n428\n00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,100\nwe've got more possibilities Hopefully\nthe longer it's gonna take them to,\n\n429\n00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,090\nto crack or break that encryption.\n\n430\n00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,520\n>> Yep, exactly that's\nthe important thing to remember.\n\n431\n00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,120\nNow, once you know about that key when we\ncompare and contrast the two the two types\n\n432\n00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,330\nof crypto, of encryption technologies,\nit really is like you said the key.\n\n433\n00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,580\nYou know, you see something,\nyou hear about symmetric.\n\n434\n00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,000\nWhen you talk about\nsymmetric cryptography,\n\n435\n00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,510\nthe key that you use to encrypt is\nthe same key you use to decrypt.\n\n436\n00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:28,030\nIf we use the Caesar cypher for that,\nit's it's a great example because if\n\n437\n00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,810\nwe use three spaces to the right,\nwe do three spaces to the left.\n\n438\n00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:34,470\nIt's the exact same key,\nasymmetric isn't like that.\n\n439\n00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,860\nAsymmetric is kind of an odd ball.\n\n440\n00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,730\nAsymmetric relies on what's\nknown as a key pair.\n\n441\n00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,040\nSo, if you use one key\nto encrypt you have to\n\n442\n00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,270\nuse the other key in the pair to decrypt.\n\n443\n00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,200\nYou can use either one to do\neither operation, but whatever\n\n444\n00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,150\none you use to initiate the operation,\nyou can only reverse it with the other.\n\n445\n00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,120\n>> The other half of the key pair?\n\n446\n00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,000\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n447\n00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,190\n>> So, they're mathematically related.\n\n448\n00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,550\nThey're generated as a pair.\n\n449\n00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,370\nAnd one of the cool things\nabout these asymmetric keys is\n\n450\n00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,960\nif you have one of the keys, they'll\nsay it's mathematically impractical\n\n451\n00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,430\nthat you could determine\nwhat the other key was.\n\n452\n00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,940\nThey won't say it's impossibly but\nmathematically impractical.\n\n453\n00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,600\nAnd one of the things, and\nI don't know if this works for you.\n\n454\n00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:20,521\nOne of the ways I like\nto think of keys and\n\n455\n00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:25,084\nsometimes I'll teach\n\n456\n00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:29,405\nwith my students is,\n\n457\n00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:37,583\nif we're all using the same algorithm.\n\n458\n00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:45,339\ndoing, say, 13 If we're all So\n\n459\n00:23:45,339 --> 00:23:49,864\nI'm not rotating 13,\n\n460\n00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:54,174\nI'm actually rotating\n\n461\n00:23:54,174 --> 00:23:59,470\nwhat is that, 18 right?\n\n462\n00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,630\nBut your key might be minus ten.\n\n463\n00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,066\nSo you're actually only rotating three.\n\n464\n00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:06,593\nInstead of 13, right?\n\n465\n00:24:06,593 --> 00:24:08,959\nSo that way we can use\nthe same algorithms, but\n\n466\n00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:12,915\nif you don't know what my key is,\nyou really don't know what I used, right?\n\n467\n00:24:12,915 --> 00:24:15,957\nYou know I'm using rod 13, but\nyou didn't know it was a plus five.\n\n468\n00:24:15,957 --> 00:24:17,234\nOr a minus four.\n\n469\n00:24:17,234 --> 00:24:19,824\nSo I like to think of the key as a way to,\nto mod,\n\n470\n00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:24,310\nto tweak the algorithm a little bit\nto make it unique for your situation.\n\n471\n00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:27,690\nNow because you know like AES I mean\nits using all these systems and if,\n\n472\n00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:31,570\nif there wasn't a key to make it\ndifferent each time we did the encryption\n\n473\n00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,210\nthen it could get you encryption back out.\n\n474\n00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:34,810\n>> Exactly.\n>> So, that,\n\n475\n00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:38,640\nthat key is what makes it unique and\nwhat makes that encryption work.\n\n476\n00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,700\n>> Yeah it's exactly.\n\n477\n00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,100\nIt can be a very tricky process,\nbut it, it, it doesn't have to be.\n\n478\n00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,470\nSee look, the good thing about\nhere is it's one of those things\n\n479\n00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,160\nthat there's not math required for.\n\n480\n00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,185\n>> Right.\n>> We, we promise, it's not gonna hurt.\n\n481\n00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:50,749\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah,\n\n482\n00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:52,190\nthat was a simplistic explanation.\n\n483\n00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:58,230\nNow in real life land, keys are anywhere\nfrom 56 bits and 4,096 bits, right?\n\n484\n00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,050\nAnd try to predict what 4,096 ones and\nzeros, you know,\n\n485\n00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,260\nI'm sticking into that equation.\n\n486\n00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,290\n>> Yeah, it's, it's.\n\n487\n00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,773\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's gonna be very tough and\n\n488\n00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:06,310\nvery complex.\n\n489\n00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,844\n>> Yeah.\n\n490\n00:25:06,844 --> 00:25:09,614\nSo with symmetric then,\nback to, back to us,\n\n491\n00:25:09,614 --> 00:25:12,490\nkinda I got us derailed\nthere a little bit.\n\n492\n00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,965\nSo with our symmetric\nwe've got one key and\n\n493\n00:25:14,965 --> 00:25:19,295\nthat key is used with that algorithm\nto generate my ciphertext.\n\n494\n00:25:19,295 --> 00:25:22,135\nAnd then the key is used\nagain on the other end\n\n495\n00:25:22,135 --> 00:25:24,910\nto turn that ciphertext\nback into plain text.\n\n496\n00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,595\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n497\n00:25:25,595 --> 00:25:26,155\n>> So I like it.\n\n498\n00:25:26,155 --> 00:25:28,395\nI mean, that sounds simple, sounds easy.\n\n499\n00:25:28,395 --> 00:25:29,549\nIt's perfect, right, you know?\n\n500\n00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:30,868\n[SOUND] Just use that.\n\n501\n00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:35,315\n>> And, and, and if you look at\na symmetric cryptographic system.\n\n502\n00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:40,830\nEssentially every cryptographic system\nuntil the modern era was, was symmetric.\n\n503\n00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,490\nWa, was symmetric every system\nthat was used to encrypt data.\n\n504\n00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,760\nBecause it was just, it was just simple.\n\n505\n00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,354\n>> It was simple.\n>> It wasn't until about the 60s or\n\n506\n00:25:49,354 --> 00:25:53,637\n70s that asymmetric you know,\ncryptography came online.\n\n507\n00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:56,970\nBecause we now had the math and\nthe computers to be able to do it.\n\n508\n00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,720\n>> Right.\nYeah, there's a\n\n509\n00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,390\n>> Computers being the key thing to that.\n\n510\n00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,960\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely cuz this symmetric,\n\n511\n00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,920\nI always considered symmetric\nalgorithm as being lightweight.\n\n512\n00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,760\nNot a lot of processing\npower required to do them.\n\n513\n00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,530\nAnd but, you know,\n\n514\n00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:12,470\nback in the 60s, 70s, 80s,\nour systems weren't all that powerful.\n\n515\n00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,345\nSo that was really kinda limiting,\nin, in what we could do with that.\n\n516\n00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:16,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n517\n00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:20,500\n>> But, but symmetric encryption being\nlightweight, being relatively quick to do\n\n518\n00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,600\nthe encryption, you know, it's very good\nat doing bulk amounts of encryption.\n\n519\n00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,910\nIt does have some drawbacks,\nthough, doesn't it?\n\n520\n00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:29,750\n>> Yes, asymmetric does have,\ndoes have some draw, or, or or if you're.\n\n521\n00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,420\nWell, if you're talking\nsymmetric that has drawbacks,\n\n522\n00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,120\nyeah there are some drawbacks to it.\n\n523\n00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,865\nAnd I, and I'll really get into\nto those some more, in a bit.\n\n524\n00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:39,700\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n525\n00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,650\n>> And that's something that you\nneed to know, by the way, is symet,\n\n526\n00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:46,610\nas you need to be able to for the exam\nis you need to be able to compare and\n\n527\n00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:49,590\ncontrast what symmetric and\nasymmetric are.\n\n528\n00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,990\nSo we're gonna cover each one\nof those in more depth here.\n\n529\n00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:57,056\nBut really look for, you know,\nwhy symmetric is a good idea and\n\n530\n00:26:57,056 --> 00:26:59,226\nnot a good idea as the case may be.\n\n531\n00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:01,537\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And why asymmetric is good and\n\n532\n00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,450\nnot good as the case may be.\n\n533\n00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,530\nBecause they both have their areas\nthat they're really good at.\n\n534\n00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:09,055\nAnd they both have there areas\nthat they are really poor at.\n\n535\n00:27:09,055 --> 00:27:10,950\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you have to know,\n\n536\n00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,360\nyou definitely have to know that.\n\n537\n00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,920\nAnd you know it's symmetric for example,\nit excels on large volumes of data.\n\n538\n00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,830\nAnd if you think about it,\n\n539\n00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:26,715\nit's only doing simple simple\nyou know manipulations of data.\n\n540\n00:27:26,715 --> 00:27:31,940\nAsymmetric on the other hand it just\ntanks on large volumes of data it just,\n\n541\n00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,930\nit just you know,\ngoes downhill really quickly.\n\n542\n00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:38,850\nSo they, you can see that\nthere's one's good at one, and\n\n543\n00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,650\none's good at anot, and\none isn't so good at it.\n\n544\n00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:46,160\nSo we have to take those and, and have to\ntake those things into, into account or\n\n545\n00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,455\nwe're doing one over the other.\n\n546\n00:27:48,455 --> 00:27:49,930\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n547\n00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:54,260\nYeah, so we,\nwe get our symmetric being single key.\n\n548\n00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,550\nThe same key is used for the encryption\nis also used for the decryption.\n\n549\n00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,280\nAnd then we, with asymmetric then,\n\n550\n00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,030\nasymmetric meaning not\nthe same on both sides.\n\n551\n00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,505\nAnd I think you've already mentioned,\nwe've got two keys, right?\n\n552\n00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:07,105\nAnd, and as you said,\n\n553\n00:28:07,105 --> 00:28:11,965\ndoesn't matter which key, both keys\ncan be used to do the encryption.\n\n554\n00:28:11,965 --> 00:28:13,605\nWhichever key you use for the encryption,\n\n555\n00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:17,205\nthe other half of the key pair then\nhas to be used for the decryption.\n\n556\n00:28:17,205 --> 00:28:17,715\n>> Exactly.\n\n557\n00:28:19,117 --> 00:28:20,265\n>> All right,\nwell I tell you what ladies and\n\n558\n00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,115\ngentlemen, that is looking at the clock,\nthat's a really good place for\n\n559\n00:28:23,115 --> 00:28:24,390\nus to take our break.\n\n560\n00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,160\nSo we're going to stop here,\n\n561\n00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,390\nwhen we come back we're going to\ndive further into cryptography.\n\n562\n00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,620\nAnd take a closer look at some of\nthe key difference between symmetric and\n\n563\n00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,960\nasymmetric and what their weaknesses\nare and what their strengths are.\n\n564\n00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,340\nSo we know when to use or\nwhen not to use a particular algorithm.\n\n565\n00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,570\nAnd then we'll get into some hashing and\nsome more cryptography coming up.\n\n566\n00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,188\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n567\n00:28:44,188 --> 00:28:50,948\n[MUSIC]\n\n568\n00:28:50,948 --> 00:28:52,740\nAll right welcome back ladies and\n\n569\n00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,380\ngentlemen, we're continuing on with\nour discussion on cryptography.\n\n570\n00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,140\nSo we left off Shawn talking about\nsome of the differences between\n\n571\n00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,250\nsymmetric encryption and\nasymmetric encryption.\n\n572\n00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,720\nSo where do you want to go next?\n\n573\n00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,730\n>> Well, let's, let's kinda,\nlet's flesh out the topics a bit more.\n\n574\n00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,574\n>> Okay.\n>> I think that's what we need to do.\n\n575\n00:29:09,574 --> 00:29:12,376\nSo let's talk about things\nthat are symmetric.\n\n576\n00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:17,482\nAnd then, I am going to do some demos of,\nsome demos to show you just kinda what\n\n577\n00:29:17,482 --> 00:29:22,615\nthey look like, and maybe help you get\nyour head, around the whole process.\n\n578\n00:29:22,615 --> 00:29:27,500\nCuz I think that really, really helps on a\nconceptual, to understand these concepts.\n\n579\n00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,800\nTo take that conceptual\nto a practical standing.\n\n580\n00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,492\n>> Okay.\n>> So symmetric as we said in the, in,\n\n581\n00:29:33,492 --> 00:29:35,501\nin the previous discussion,\n\n582\n00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:39,891\nis a, is a form of encryption that uses\nthe same key to encrypt and decrypt.\n\n583\n00:29:39,891 --> 00:29:46,460\nYou just choose the key that's,\nthat's allowable by the algorithm's rules.\n\n584\n00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,720\n>> And once you have that you\nuse it to perform the process.\n\n585\n00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:55,680\nNow once you once, once you have that,\nyou go ahead and do your whole thing.\n\n586\n00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,550\nNow you've got if they encrypted or\ndecrypted as the case may be.\n\n587\n00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,230\nBut there are some problems there.\n\n588\n00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,010\nThe, the, that system is very simple.\n\n589\n00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,235\nVery, very simple,\nwhich sounds like a great thing.\n\n590\n00:30:06,235 --> 00:30:07,830\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It is a great thing, but\n\n591\n00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,170\ndepends on how you look at it, okay?\n\n592\n00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,800\nThe great things about\nsymmetric are that it\n\n593\n00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,280\nworks very fast on large volumes of data.\n\n594\n00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,805\nSo that's a big plus.\n\n595\n00:30:16,805 --> 00:30:17,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n596\n00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:23,140\n>> But then you have you know,\nsome issues such as key distribution.\n\n597\n00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,820\n>> Mm.\n\n598\n00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,660\n>> Key distribution is a, is a big,\nbig, big problem with symmetric.\n\n599\n00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,730\nWhat you have to do Is you have to,\n\n600\n00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,770\nif you encrypt something with a,\nwith an a, with a symmetric algorithm and\n\n601\n00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:41,040\nyou distribute that, you need to figure\nout a way to get the key to someone.\n\n602\n00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,980\nBecause you're telling them hey here's the\nencrypted chunk of data, the cipher text,\n\n603\n00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,230\nand here's the algorithm I used to do\nthat, cuz they have to know what you used.\n\n604\n00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,720\nBut then you gotta tell\nthem what the specific\n\n605\n00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,569\nkey is that they're gonna\nuse to reverse your process.\n\n606\n00:30:55,569 --> 00:30:59,290\n>> So if somebody stole my\ndata during that distribution,\n\n607\n00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,700\nthen I gotta transmit\nthe key somehow to them.\n\n608\n00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,250\nAnd if somebody stole the key, since it's\nthe same key, so decrypted is encrypted,\n\n609\n00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,840\nthat means they could\ndecrypt my data as well.\n\n610\n00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,140\n>> Exactly.\n\n611\n00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,670\nAnd, and on another level, think about it.\n\n612\n00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:16,790\nIf someone gave you a key, if I\nenrolled you in a symmetric system and\n\n613\n00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:20,050\nissued you a key, and\nsomeone intercepted that.\n\n614\n00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,860\nNot only could they decrypt your data,\n\n615\n00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:27,470\nif I issued that key to you, they could\nalso encrypt data and look like you to me.\n\n616\n00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:31,720\nSo we don't have a way of doing,\nnon-repediation.\n\n617\n00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,720\n>> It becomes an issue.\n\n618\n00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,860\n>> Yeah, it's a big, big issue, so\n\n619\n00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,270\nwe have to have a key management\nsolution to make this work.\n\n620\n00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:43,030\nSo, it means that,\nif this case is symmetric,\n\n621\n00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:47,400\nI have to transport the encrypted\ndata with the algorithm to you.\n\n622\n00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,930\nAnd then,\nI need to find what they call and\n\n623\n00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:52,610\nout of band distribution\nmechanism to get that key to you.\n\n624\n00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:56,250\nAnd all that means is that\nif I email the data to you,\n\n625\n00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,880\nI call you on the phone and, and\nrecite the key that way over to you.\n\n626\n00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,209\nSo, the-\n>> Cuz the,\n\n627\n00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:05,006\nthe logic there is that if they were able\nto intercept the email to get the data.\n\n628\n00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,956\nAnd I try to send the keys\nin that same channel,\n\n629\n00:32:06,956 --> 00:32:09,458\nthen they're most likely gonna\nintercept the key as well.\n\n630\n00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:11,638\n>> Yes.\n>> But if I send the data via email, but\n\n631\n00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:15,646\nthen I call you on the phone to give you\nthe key Hoping that maybe they don't have\n\n632\n00:32:15,646 --> 00:32:18,229\naccess to both of those\ncommunication channels.\n\n633\n00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:21,980\n>> Yes, they'd have to compromise both or\nhave access to both, and that,\n\n634\n00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,710\nthat makes it a lot\nsafer to do it that way.\n\n635\n00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,246\nBut, you can imagine the problems\nthat would cause them.\n\n636\n00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:28,135\n>> Not very convenient, is it?\n\n637\n00:32:28,135 --> 00:32:29,385\n>> No, not at all.\n\n638\n00:32:29,385 --> 00:32:33,285\nAnd definitely not at all, You'd have\nto figure out a way to, if I mean,\n\n639\n00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:37,435\nif it was just you and me distributing\nthe key, no, not, not a tremendous thing.\n\n640\n00:32:37,435 --> 00:32:41,075\nBut if I included you, me, plus everyone\nin this office that needs to have their\n\n641\n00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:44,865\nown unique key, then I have to not\nonly create those unique keys and\n\n642\n00:32:44,865 --> 00:32:46,505\nthen distribute those\nkeys to everyone else,\n\n643\n00:32:46,505 --> 00:32:48,800\nbecause I need to be\nable to crypt your stuff.\n\n644\n00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,720\nSo I need to have that identical key and\nthen it's now scout's honor if someone\n\n645\n00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,630\ndoesn't use some else's key to,\nto impersonate them.\n\n646\n00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:59,900\nIt's just a big problem, which is what\nthe, one of the big issues we have with,\n\n647\n00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,450\nwith symmetric systems.\n\n648\n00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:05,330\nSo there, there,\nwe gotta find a way to solve that.\n\n649\n00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:10,000\nUnfortunately symmetric doesn't have\na way to solve it in it, in of itself.\n\n650\n00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,660\nYou need to find another way outside of,\nof symmetric to solve that issue.\n\n651\n00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,510\nAnd we have yet to talk about that.\n\n652\n00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,370\nBut we will talk about what that is.\n\n653\n00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,520\nWe'll leave for another lesson.\n\n654\n00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:28,160\nSo, what I think, you know, kind of\nhelps here is to take a look at what,\n\n655\n00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,780\nat what a symmetric cipher looks like.\n\n656\n00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:36,530\nAnd what I'm gonna use here is,\nI have on my computer I have a website.\n\n657\n00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,360\nThat I'm going to use to demo this.\n\n658\n00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,860\nThis website is called, the, it's,\nyou can Google this, this is,\n\n659\n00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:49,740\nyou Google the name Simon Singh,\nS-I-N-G-H, and the words Black Chamber,\n\n660\n00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:55,418\nand it, he'll, he has this page that\nshows different encryption technologies.\n\n661\n00:33:55,418 --> 00:33:55,982\nAnd he,\n\n662\n00:33:55,982 --> 00:34:00,305\nit, it's all done in basic JavaScript To\nillustrate how these things work.\n\n663\n00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:04,240\n>> Nice.\n>> So what I've seen here is I am seeing,\n\n664\n00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,040\non, on the screen I'm seeing\nan example of the Caesar cipher.\n\n665\n00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,510\nNow to really, truly be the Caesar cipher,\nwe have to use a key shift of three.\n\n666\n00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,390\nYou can see the default up here is 18,\nso that just isn't gonna work.\n\n667\n00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:18,930\nWe want to do this, we really,\ntruly want to do the Caesar cipher.\n\n668\n00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:21,750\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna do this offset, and\n\n669\n00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,050\nremember another word for offset is, key.\n\n670\n00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,070\n>> Key, okay.\n>> So, we're going to go ahead and\n\n671\n00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,420\nwe're going to put that in there and\n\n672\n00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,795\nI'm going to click down here and you can\nsee the, the letters actually updated.\n\n673\n00:34:31,795 --> 00:34:32,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n674\n00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:33,066\n>> I can have my plain text alphabet.\n\n675\n00:34:33,066 --> 00:34:34,041\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> D becomes an E.\n\n676\n00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:37,241\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n677\n00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:42,580\nYou now have your, your, your formula for\nmoving between, you know, two.\n\n678\n00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,960\nYou can, you very quickly saw you\ndidn't even have to explain it right.\n\n679\n00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,048\n>> Huh yeah.\n>> You know,\n\n680\n00:34:46,048 --> 00:34:50,521\nit's just went 3CA goes to D and, and,\nyou know, and so on and so forth.\n\n681\n00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:53,080\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So if we want to see that in use\n\n682\n00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:57,510\nall we have to do is go over\nhere to our plain text section.\n\n683\n00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,330\nAnd I could type in something like,\nhello world.\n\n684\n00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,515\nJust to keep it simple.\n\n685\n00:35:01,515 --> 00:35:03,270\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, type in hello world and\n\n686\n00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:06,280\nthey give you a nice button here\nthat says in cipher plaintext.\n\n687\n00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,070\nI click on that.\n\n688\n00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:10,625\nAnd you can see, it comes up with\nsomething down at the bottom.\n\n689\n00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:11,710\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n690\n00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:16,150\n>> It comes up with, instead of hello\nworld, it comes up with K-H-O-O-R.\n\n691\n00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:19,320\nAnd then Z-R-U, O-G.\n\n692\n00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,085\nSo, unrecognizable as far as, you know,\n\n693\n00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:23,260\ndefinitely doesn't say\n\"Hello world\" Anymore.\n\n694\n00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,160\n>> Doesn't say it anymore.\n\n695\n00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,700\n>> But, I do notice that it, you know,\nthe same number of letters in the output,\n\n696\n00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,100\nsame space in there between the words\n>> Yes.\n\n697\n00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,910\nYes.\nYou,\n\n698\n00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,690\nthat's, that's definitely\na good point to bring up.\n\n699\n00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,770\nThis also kinda, builds into\nsomething that was talked about, I,\n\n700\n00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,390\nI talked about it a little earlier,\nwas a stream cipher, if you recall?\n\n701\n00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:42,940\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n702\n00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,760\n>> A stream cipher,\nwhich this definitely is.\n\n703\n00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,379\n>> Mm.\nA stream cipher operates on a bit by bit\n\n704\n00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:53,191\nlevel and one of the drawbacks of it is is\nthat it operates on a bit by bit level,\n\n705\n00:35:53,191 --> 00:35:56,817\nwhat goes in is gonna be the same\nsize on the other side and so\n\n706\n00:35:56,817 --> 00:36:02,147\nwhat we're seeing here is that you may not\nknow what that message is underneath that,\n\n707\n00:36:02,147 --> 00:36:05,213\nbut you do know how long\nthe message actually is.\n\n708\n00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:07,216\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So that's already got you to,\n\n709\n00:36:07,216 --> 00:36:11,470\nthat's already got you some, you know,\ndone some of the leg work for you.\n\n710\n00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:14,520\n>> If you were trying to break this, then\nyou, you got a piece of the puzzle there.\n\n711\n00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,470\n>> Yeah, and\nyou can also start to see some, the,\n\n712\n00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:21,570\nthe beginnings of something I'm gonna,\nthat I'm gonna expand upon more\n\n713\n00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:26,752\nlater on in, in, in this, in,\nin, this section on cryptography.\n\n714\n00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:30,259\nIf you notice in here and you look at,\nwhen you look at Hello World, and\n\n715\n00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:34,266\nyou look at the cipher text, you know,\nnotice that you see that you see how,\n\n716\n00:36:34,266 --> 00:36:36,130\nthe letters, the letters down there.\n\n717\n00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:38,000\nLook at how often some\nof the letters appear.\n\n718\n00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,540\n>> Right.\n>> When your looking at the cipher text..\n\n719\n00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,485\n>> I see that there's a particular letter\nthat shows, if I didn't have the plain\n\n720\n00:36:42,485 --> 00:36:46,090\ntext, I could see just from the cipher\ntext, something is in there three times.\n\n721\n00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,151\n>> Yes.\n>> All right.\n\n722\n00:36:47,151 --> 00:36:51,014\n>> So, yeah, if you know, if you know\nthat that's, that's the Caesar cipher,\n\n723\n00:36:51,014 --> 00:36:54,763\nyou can look at that and say well I don't\nknow what that letter is exactly, but\n\n724\n00:36:54,763 --> 00:36:56,685\nyeah I know it's in there three times.\n\n725\n00:36:56,685 --> 00:36:57,324\n>> Right.\n\n726\n00:36:57,324 --> 00:37:01,932\n>> And the thing is that there is a such\nthing as an attack on cryptography\n\n727\n00:37:01,932 --> 00:37:07,320\ncalled frequency analysis and\nevery language is, is vulnerable to this.\n\n728\n00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,620\nIs if you look at this, if you look\nat a language, you can tell how\n\n729\n00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,540\noften certain words, phrases, and\ncharacters appear in each language, and\n\n730\n00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:18,440\nthey actually have that for really,\njust about every language out there.\n\n731\n00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,390\nThe English language,\nif you look at it, you know,\n\n732\n00:37:20,390 -->

think of,\nwhat was that Jeopardy.\n\n735\n00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:27,904\nYou know, they give you the R,\nS, T, L and E.\n\n736\n00:37:27,904 --> 00:37:28,774\n>> Wheel of

choose those same letters.\n\n743\n00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:37,760\nYou're always like, why aren't they\nchoosing those different letters.\n\n744\n00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,860\nCuz, you know, if you picked\nthe letter x or q, you're an idiot.\n\n745\n00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,795\nThose don't appear all that often.\n\n746\n00:37:42,795 --> 00:37:43,630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You

we've, we've, this, this,\n\n749\n00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:53,490\nthis is the this is the Caesar cipher and\nyou know,\n\n750\n00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:56,430\nwhat that, what that specifically\ndoes you know, for us.\n\n751\n00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,950\nYou can see very quickly it's\na simple substitution cipher.\n\n752\n00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,800\nThis goes to this.\n\n753\n00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,420\nNow, I want, I, wa, it's a s, symmetric\ncipher, but it's also substitution.\n\n754\n00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,205\nSubstitute something for something else.\n\n755\n00:38:07,205 -->

you can use,\n\n758\n00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,180\nthere's also something out\nhere called the Pigpen cipher.\n\n759\n00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:22,620\nThe pigpen cipher is, is, is a great\nexample of another great example of a,\n\n760\n00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,060\nof a, symmetr, or a, sorry,\na substitution cipher.\n\n761\n00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,970\nNow you substitute characters.\n\n762\n00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:30,500\nSo I go to my, our internet tools.\n\n763\n00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,770\n>> A little slow, a little bit.\n\n764\n00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,400\n>>

--> 00:38:51,969\nlooks like it's a little slow today.\nSo.\n\n780\n00:38:51,969 --> 00:38:52,980\n>> Locked up. All right. >> All right.\n\n781\n00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,010\n>> So you know, I haven't heard of the,\nthe pigpen cipher, so\n\n782\n00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:57,320\nit's another substitution

of seen the pigpen cipher,\n\n785\n00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,895\njust may not have called it that.\n\n786\n00:39:05,895 --> 00:39:07,599\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> It's also called the Freemason

something that we see on the\nback of cereal boxes and stuff like that.\n\n792\n00:39:21,045 --> 00:39:22,880\n>> Huh.\n>> It's a little puzzle for kids.\n\n793\n00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,440\nBut what they'll do is they'll write,\nyou know?\n\n794\n00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,970\nFor example, you know, if you kind of\nhave a vision, you've got a tic-tac-toe.\n\n795\n00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,400\nThe little, little symbol and\nthen you have A, B, C, D.\n\n796\n00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,290\nYou know, A, B, C, and then D, E, F going\nright through there, once you do that,\n\n797\n00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,694\nyou write, you write that a couple times.\n\n798\n00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:41,475\nOne has just, one has the letters in it,\nthen the next nine letters are done\n\n799\n00:39:41,475 --> 00:39:44,210\nin the same thing, but\nthey put dots in each one with the letter.\n\n800\n00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,805\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you know it's this one and\n\n801\n00:39:45,805 --> 00:39:46,410\nnot this one.\n\n802\n00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,165\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n803\n00:39:47,165 --> 00:39:50,245\n>> And they do, and what they do is\nthey write the

corner.\n\n806\n00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,100\nDon't right the letter A,\njust the write that corner of the symbol.\n\n807\n00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,486\nSo you'd have, you know, that popping up.\n\n808\n00:40:00,486 --> 00:40:02,148\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> And then you just do that for\n\n809\n00:40:02,148 --> 00:40:03,049\nevery letter.\n\n810\n00:40:03,049 --> 00:40:04,124\n>> I see what you're saying.\n\n811\n00:40:04,124 --> 00:40:06,517\n>> So you're substituting, and\nnow it's come up on my screen here,\n\n812\n00:40:06,517 --> 00:40:08,994\nI think you can get a better look at it,\nwhat I'm talking about here,\n\n813\n00:40:08,994 --> 00:40:11,069\nif you see up top,\nthat's what I'm trying to describe.\n\n814\n00:40:11,069 --> 00:40:12,497\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n815\n00:40:12,497 -->

dot in the corner.\n\n817\n00:40:19,345 --> 00:40:19,983\n>> Exactly.\n\n818\n00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:21,340\n>> Okay.\n\n819\n00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,840\n>> And so it's, it's, it's simple.\n\n820\n00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,470\nYou just, your plain text is just what,\nyou, you write it out, and then\n\n821\n00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:33,070\nyou just substitute that by, that shape of\nthat box in there, and send it somebody.\n\n822\n00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:36,589\nThis is probably something, like I said,\nthis is probably something that you've\n\n823\n00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:39,420\nseen in kid's puzzle books, and\ncereal boxes, stuff like that.\n\n824\n00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,036\n>> Yeah, like the menu places, the place\nmats at some restaurants where you can\n\n825\n00:40:42,036 --> 00:40:43,900\ncolor and draw,\nyou've got stuff like that on there.\n\n826\n00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,200\n>> Yeah.\nIt's a simple thing.\n\n827\n00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,027\nThat was actually at one point\nconsidered to be, in the middle ages,\n\n828\n00:40:48,027 --> 00:40:50,006\nconsidered to be a good\ncryptographic system.\n\n829\n00:40:50,006 -->

another form\nof substitution cipher looks like.\n\n846\n00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,713\nSo, just so you kind of know,\nit is symmetric, you know, but it's, but\n\n847\n00:41:29,713 --> 00:41:32,730\nit's something we call\nin substitution cipher.\n\n848\n00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:37,320\nSo, really, kind of great example,\nyou know of the two.\n\n849\n00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:42,820\nNow something else I wanna kinda,\ndemonstrate here is I kinda want to show\n\n850\n00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:46,730\nyou how we, you know, how we come up with\nan algorithm, how that actually looks.\n\n851\n00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:49,912\nAnd what I'm gonna do is since we've\nbeen spending some time talking about,\n\n852\n00:41:49,912 --> 00:41:55,060\nthe Caesar, cipher, what I want to do is,\nI want to use that as my,\n\n853\n00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,100\nas my example, and show you what\nan algorithm, show you how things relate.\n\n854\n00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,590\nYou know, so what I'm gonna do is,\nI am gonna bring up my,\n\n855\n00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:06,620\nwhite board here, and, on my white board,\nI am going to, you know,\n\n856\n00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:12,160\nshow you, you know, and show you\nwhat an algorithm would look like.\n\n857\n00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,950\nSo we already know,\nyou know what the Caesar cipher does it-.\n\n858\n00:42:14,950 -->

go the other way,\nI mean,\n\n900\n00:43:54,895 --> 00:43:59,759\nyou can probably rationalize\nthis it's C minus K, equals X.\n\n901\n00:43:59,759 --> 00:44:01,150\n>> Right.\n\n902\n00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:04,950\nSo if we, if we remember our algebra and\nwe start solving for C or whatever.\n\n903\n00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:07,200\n>> I just screwed it up,\nI did Y over here and\n\n904\n00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,710\nC over here\n>> It's all good,\n\n905\n00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:11,380\nit's all good I think we\nsee what you're saying.\n\n906\n00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,940\nSo yeah, if you reverse it obviously if\nyou take your cipher text and you take out\n\n907\n00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,440\nyour offset then you're left with your\nplain text or the original letter.\n\n908\n00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,990\n>> Exactly.\n>> I like it.\n\n909\n00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,800\nAnd, and, and see that should help you\nvisualize what an algorithm, you know,\n\n910\n00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,960\nlooks like.\n\n911\n00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,090\nIt's very, it's very, very simple when\nyou think about it in those terms.\n\n912\n00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,870\nWhat I would,\nwhat I would encourage you to do,\n\n913\n00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:37,160\nif you're still kind of a little fuzzy on\non encry, on encryption decryption and\n\n914\n00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,538\nalgorithms and all that remember this,\nremember the Caesar cipher.\n\n915\n00:44:41,538 --> 00:44:45,400\nThe Caesar cipher you know,\nillustrates a lot of the things, that,\n\n916\n00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,730\nyou know, it illustrates a lot of things\nthat we, that, that we have in, in,\n\n917\n00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:52,550\nin the encryption field,\nin symmetric at least.\n\n918\n00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:56,100\nYou can see that right there and\nbe like okay, now I get it.\n\n919\n00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,860\nAll the stuff you have here\napplies to all symmetric ciphers.\n\n920\n00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,724\n>> Nice.\n\n921\n00:44:59,724 --> 00:45:00,967\nI like it.\n\n922\n00:45:00,967 --> 00:45:02,429\nI like it.\n\n923\n00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:03,986\nAnd you are definitely an artist.\n\n924\n00:45:03,986 --> 00:45:04,589\n>> I know.\n\n925\n00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:07,543\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> If your, if your encryption knowledge\n\n926\n00:45:07,543 --> 00:45:12,535\nis as fuzzy as my drawing, then,\nyou need to, you need to stop right now.\n\n927\n00:45:12,535 --> 00:45:15,763\n>> [LAUGH] I love it.\n\n928\n00:45:15,763 --> 00:45:18,475\nI love it.\nSo, yeah, symmetrics, I guess we want to\n\n929\n00:45:18,475 --> 00:45:22,740\nrehash symmetrics, the big thing is\nit's the same key on both sides.\n\n930\n00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,920\nRight, the one key that whatever key\nyou use with the algorithm to do\n\n931\n00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,400\nthe encryption the other, the other half\nto decrypt it has to use that same key.\n\n932\n00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,340\nAnd it's definitely got its strong suits\nand still has its uses out there today.\n\n933\n00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,930\nIt's very fast, it's very light weight,\nit doesn't take a lot of processing power.\n\n934\n00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:41,370\nSo, it's really good doing\nthe bulk amounts of data.\n\n935\n00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,530\nIf you got to encrypt\na lot of information,\n\n936\n00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:47,510\nsymmetric algorithms are pretty quick,\ndoesn't take a lot of processing power.\n\n937\n00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:51,370\nThe downsides that we've discussed is\ngoing to be the key distribution part.\n\n938\n00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:56,150\nBecause if I'm going to use the same key\nto decrypt the information, then wherever\n\n939\n00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:00,200\nI distribute that encrypted information,\nI also have to distribute the key so\n\n940\n00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,280\nthat they can decrypt and\nget that orignal information back out.\n\n941\n00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,770\nAnd if there's a bad guy intercepting\nthat data, then there very well could be,\n\n942\n00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:08,770\nhe could be intercepting that key as well.\n\n943\n00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:12,600\nWhich means my,\nmy confidentiality has become compromised.\n\n944\n00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,080\nSo we, we've gotta, we're gonna end up,\nand Sean has said earlier,\n\n945\n00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,870\nhe's indicated that there\nare things that we can do\n\n946\n00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:21,230\nalong with symmetric encryption\nalgorithms to help improve that.\n\n947\n00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:24,710\nAnd try to take care of that\ndownside of that problem, that,\n\n948\n00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:29,520\nthat weakness that that\nsymmetric encryption has.\n\n949\n00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,580\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n950\n00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,440\nAnd something else that really\nneeds to fit into this whole\n\n951\n00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,345\nprocess is when we're talking about\nsymmetric, we need to talk algorithms.\n\n952\n00:46:37,345 --> 00:46:38,070\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, the,\n\n953\n00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:40,350\nwe definitely need to talk algorithms.\n\n954\n00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:43,320\nAlgorithms that we have for symmetric.\n\n955\n00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,705\n>> Mm.\n>> Some of the big guys.\n\n956\n00:46:44,705 --> 00:46:47,640\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Aes, advanced encryption standard.\n\n957\n00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,400\nAlso known as

having.\n\n963\n00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:55,970\n>> It got rebranded as Aes.\n\n964\n00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:58,385\n>> Yep.\n>> So they're really the same thing.\n\n965\n00:46:58,385 --> 00:46:59,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n966\n00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,410\n>> Then we have DES.\n\n967\n00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:02,215\nThe you know, data encryption standard.\n\n968\n00:47:02,215 -->

know,\n\n973\n00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:15,695\non, on, on that list that you will see.\n\n974\n00:47:15,695 --> 00:47:16,270\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n975\n00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:19,376\n>> Now one of those DES,

so.\n\n981\n00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:27,960\nYou know, you, so you've got AES and\n\n982\n00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,480\ntriple DES are very\ncommonly seen nowadays.\n\n983\n00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,010\n>> So in the exam they could ask us,\nwhat's an example of?\n\n984\n00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,570\nOr here's a list of encryption algorithms.\n\n985\n00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:37,290\nWhich ones of these are symmetric?\n\n986\n00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:38,330\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n987\n00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:42,600\nAnd, and I, I would be prepared for\nthe exam, be prepared for\n\n988\n00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,470\nthem to ask questions on,\nyou know, which one of this,\n\n989\n00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:51,690\nwhich one of the ones on this list are are\nsymmetric, or which ones are asymmetric.\n\n990\n00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:52,530\nYou know, which one of these\n\n991\n00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:54,030\nones is not like the other-\n>> Right.\n\n992\n00:47:54,030 -->

00:48:01,725\nsymmetric, asymmetric, and hashing.\n\n995\n00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:05,375\n>> Mm-hm\n>> So what I would tell you for homework.\n\n996\n00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,840\n>> Mm-hm [LAUGH]\n>> If I was gonna put it that way, for\n\n997\n00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,500\nhomework is, you should probably\nmake a flashcard with that.\n\n998\n00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,852\nThat's the way I always\nrecommend studying.\n\n999\n00:48:11,852 --> 00:48:14,170\n>> Yeah.\n>> Make a flashcard and put the different,\n\n1000\n00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:18,118\nand put you know symmetric,\nasymmetric, and hashing on there.\n\n1001\n00:48:18,118 --> 00:48:22,541\nList out the algorithms and memorize those\nalgorithms No key lengths, you know,\n\n1002\n00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:25,359\nwhen you talk about key\nlengths keys can be you know,\n\n1003\n00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,880\n56 bit like you said\nall the way up to 496.\n\n1004\n00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:32,360\nNow you're not going to get 496 bit\nones on the EC-Council Exam, but\n\n1005\n00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,000\nyou will see those in the real world.\n\n1006\n00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,160\nKey length does impact how strong that,\nthat key will actually be.\n\n1007\n00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,820\nI guess it's one factor.\n\n1008\n00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,660\n>> And the algorithm is what determines\nwhat possible key lengths I can use.\n\n1009\n00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:50,170\nSo it's important that we know that we\nlook at AES, that we know whether or\n\n1010\n00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:52,990\nnot it's a symmetric or asymmetric, and\n\n1011\n00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:55,890\nwhat possible key lengths they\ncan use with that algorithm.\n\n1012\n00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:57,520\n>> Yes.\nAll those things are hard coded into\n\n1013\n00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:02,130\nthe algorithm and defined,\nexactly what you can and cannot use.\n\n1014\n00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:04,610\nThere are rules, and that's really\nwhat you can look at an algorithm, is,\n\n1015\n00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:09,600\nit imposes rules on you know what can and\ncan not be done.\n\n1016\n00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,700\nYou know, so\nit's just your choice to use what out of\n\n1017\n00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:18,620\nthat key space as they call it and\nuse that for your encryption process.\n\n1018\n00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,979\nAnd, and I would like to if I can,\nI always like to say,\n\n1019\n00:49:21,979 --> 00:49:26,086\na good way to think about an algorithm and\na key in all those things.\n\n1020\n00:49:26,086 --> 00:49:30,470\nAnd, and, and roll in Kerckhoffs's\nprinciple and all into it,\n\n1021\n00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:36,420\nis think of an algorithm kind of like a,\na, padlock or a combination lock.\n\n1022\n00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,900\nYou can, you open those things up and\n\n1023\n00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,740\nyou can look at the blueprints for\nthem all day long.\n\n1024\n00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:47,230\nBut that doesn't mean that if you've got\none model lock, and I've got that same\n\n1025\n00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:51,040\nmodel lock, even if you dissected yours\nand looked at the bru, blueprints for\n\n1026\n00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,220\nit, you know all the different ways the\ntumblers and all that can move in there.\n\n1027\n00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,432\nBut that doesn't tell you what\nthe tumbler combination is for mine.\n\n1028\n00:49:58,432 --> 00:50:00,210\n>> Mm-hm.\nCuz that's unique to your lock.\n\n1029\n00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:01,470\n>> That, that's unique.\n\n1030\n00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:05,180\nYou might be able to stumble upon\nit by fiddling with the things,\n\n1031\n00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:07,808\nand get some measure of luck doing it.\n\n1032\n00:50:07,808 --> 00:50:11,948\nYou know, but you can't tell, you can\ntell the different combinations they\n\n1033\n00:50:11,948 --> 00:50:14,568\ncan go into and\npositions this thing can go into.\n\n1034\n00:50:14,568 --> 00:50:16,087\nBut you can't tell what it is for\n\n1035\n00:50:16,087 --> 00:50:18,463\nmy specific lock without\na lot of trial and error.\n\n1036\n00:50:18,463 --> 00:50:20,832\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n1037\n00:50:20,832 --> 00:50:24,690\nAll right well I tell you what it is\ncoming up on the end of this segment.\n\n1038\n00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:27,640\nWe've pretty much covered\nsymmetric I think pretty well.\n\n1039\n00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,090\nIf there's anything else you\nwant to add on, on that.\n\n1040\n00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:31,440\nOr, we good with that?\n\n1041\n00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,370\n>> I, I, think we're, I think we're good.\n\n1042\n00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:36,650\n>> Okay, all right well then why don't\nwe stop here and we'll go ahead and,\n\n1043\n00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:38,350\nand, and, and wrap this up.\n\n1044\n00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:42,960\nAnd then Mon or our next episode\nwe'll come back with a part two and\n\n1045\n00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,380\nthen we'll continue on with some\nasymmetric cryptography, get into hashing.\n\n1046\n00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,770\nIt's hard to look at the public-key\nof a structure and things like that.\n\n1047\n00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,874\nWe'll continue on with\nour cryptography topic.\n\n1048\n00:50:52,874 --> 00:50:53,640\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1049\n00:50:53,640 -->

00:00:08.285\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.285 --> 00:00:12.004\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.004 --> 00:00:15.922\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to your\nCisco Cybersecurity Fundamentals Series.\n\n6\n00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:19.060\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.190\nIn this episodes, we're gonna be\ndescribing basic network addressing.\n\n8\n00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.660\nSo with us today,\nwe have Ronnie Wong in studios.\n\n9\n00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.140\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.720\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me here as\nwe continue on taking a look at more of\n\n11\n00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.680\nthe basic networking concepts we really\nhave to have under our belt as we start to\n\n12\n00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.480\nmove forward in the realm of cyber ops\n&gt;&gt; Sir Ronnie, I know understanding\n\n13\n00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.560\nwork addressing that usually something you\nget right of the back when you're inner\n\n14\n00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.520\ninto ITs so how, where we going to start\nand how deeper we going to go with this.\n\n15\n00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.480\n&gt;&gt; Well we're not going to go incredibly\ndeep but we need to start up with\n\n16\n00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.110\nunderstanding what it has to be there for\ndevices to communicate.\n\n17\n00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.112\nNot only on the same IP network but\neven between different IP networks.\n\n18\n00:01:00.112 --> 00:01:03.556\nSo, the goal behind what we're\ntaking look at today of course is,\n\n19\n00:01:03.556 --> 00:01:06.769\nunderstanding the basic addressing\nneeds that have to go on.\n\n20\n00:01:06.769 --> 00:01:10.956\nAs well as understanding what has\nto happen within a single sub net.\n\n21\n00:01:10.956 --> 00:01:14.800\nAnd then of course across multiple sub\nnets if we are gonna start the idea of\n\n22\n00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.797\ncommunications.\n\n23\n00:01:15.797 --> 00:01:19.550\nSo that is pretty much the key\nof what we're going to be doing.\n\n24\n00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.300\nSo we're really going to do some\nfundamentals in terms of saying,\n\n25\n00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.820\nare these devices naturally going to\nbe able to communicate with each other?\n\n26\n00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.024\nIf not,\nwhat else do we need to have happen and\n\n27\n00:01:29.024 --> 00:01:32.923\nmake sure that it gets there when we start\nassigning them to different devices.\n\n28\n00:01:32.923 --> 00:01:34.570\nSo that's what we are taking a look at-\n&gt;&gt; Perfect.\n\n29\n00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.484\n&gt;&gt; And where it begins.\n\n30\n00:01:35.484 --> 00:01:40.183\nOkay, so let's talk about the idea\nhere of IP addresses within a subnet.\n\n31\n00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:43.852\nNow, this is not something I\ntypically like to do too much of, but\n\n32\n00:01:43.852 --> 00:01:45.607\nit's something we need to do.\n\n33\n00:01:45.607 --> 00:01:48.753\nWhich is we're just going to work with a\nsheet of paper right now, and essentially\n\n34\n00:01:48.753 --> 00:01:51.930\nkind of take some notes and make sure\nthat we understand what's going on.\n\n35\n00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.447\nLet's take a look at my machine and that\nwill help us out right at the beginning\n\n36\n00:01:56.447 --> 00:02:00.773\nwhen we start to take a look at the idea\nof basic IP network addressing too.\n\n37\n00:02:00.773 --> 00:02:06.825\nSo, when we start talking about within a\nsubnet, I guess that’s pretty much the key\n\n38\n00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:12.642\nis to make sure that we understand this\nidea of what we mean by the subnet, right?\n\n39\n00:02:12.642 --> 00:02:17.280\nRemember that an IP address has\ntwo portions of the IP address.\n\n40\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.000\nThere is going to be a network portion,\nalso known as network ID.\n\n41\n00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.600\nAnd then, of course, there's going to be\nwhat other people consider a node portion\n\n42\n00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.710\nof the address, or a host ID as well.\n\n43\n00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.820\nOkay, so within a subnet,\nthe key here is that every device\n\n44\n00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:43.500\nhas the same network ID, okay?\n\n45\n00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.560\nSo within a subnet,\nfour communications happen.\n\n46\n00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.405\nEvery single device in that subnet\nshares a same common portion of what\n\n47\n00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:53.055\nwe call the network ID.\n\n48\n00:02:53.055 --> 00:02:56.932\n&gt;&gt; Like you were explaining to us\nthe other day about every house on that\n\n49\n00:02:56.932 --> 00:03:00.267\nparticular street shares\nthe street address that's part\n\n50\n00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:02.510\nof their actual full address.\n\n51\n00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.480\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so for example, right?\n\n52\n00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.030\nIf we were to take the idea of two\ncomputers being on the same network.\n\n53\n00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.352\nWe'll just use probably the most common\none that we generally end up seeing here.\n\n54\n00:03:12.352 --> 00:03:16.233\nWhich is gonna be let's say 192.168.1.\n\n55\n00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:21.611\nAnd I'll just start with 1.,\nlet me do 100 for right now and\n\n56\n00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:26.930\nwe'll give it a subnet\nmask of 255.255.255.0.\n\n57\n00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.032\nOn that particular network,\nthe subnet mask, if you remember,\n\n58\n00:03:31.032 --> 00:03:36.327\nshows us essentially which portion of that\n32 bit address is going to be the network\n\n59\n00:03:36.327 --> 00:03:40.898\nportion, which is going to be the first\nthree octets is what we'll see.\n\n60\n00:03:40.898 --> 00:03:46.184\nAnd then, another machine on\nthat same network 192.168.1,\n\n61\n00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:49.190\nand then I could go 110 if I wanted to.\n\n62\n00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.630\nSo, both of those machines,\nif we were to assign IP addresses to them,\n\n63\n00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.520\nthey would share, well,\nthe same network portion.\n\n64\n00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.920\nSo, that is the key for communications to\nbegin to happen within that same network.\n\n65\n00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.480\nNow, the other part of that key\nis at because they have to be\n\n66\n00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.108\nable to communicate,\nthey cannot share the actual host ID.\n\n67\n00:04:15.108 --> 00:04:20.480\nSo, every device within the same,\n\n68\n00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.709\nI can't spell same.\n\n69\n00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:26.170\nSame Network, okay.\n\n70\n00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.680\nHas to have a unique.\n\n71\n00:04:31.662 --> 00:04:33.075\nHost ID.\n\n72\n00:04:36.202 --> 00:04:40.021\nSo would be for\nus here on this one as an example,\n\n73\n00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:45.092\nthis is where we would find\nthe unique portion of this address.\n\n74\n00:04:45.092 --> 00:04:46.086\nLet me just copy and paste it.\n\n75\n00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:48.285\nThat way you don't have\nto watch me type here.\n\n76\n00:04:48.285 --> 00:04:50.101\nWell, maybe.\n\n77\n00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:54.011\n&gt;&gt; Now, Ronnie, looking at these\nexamples that you've given,\n\n78\n00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:58.806\nit's easy to go ahead and identify because\nwe're looking at a Class C address\n\n79\n00:04:58.806 --> 00:05:03.660\nwhich is historically one of\nthose classic addressing spaces.\n\n80\n00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.828\nHowever, guys, just remember that\nIt's not always that fourth octet\n\n81\n00:05:07.828 --> 00:05:11.166\nthat's gonna be signifying\nthat host portion of the ID.\n\n82\n00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:15.749\nIf you are using any kind of class\nlist and inter-domain routing, or\n\n83\n00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:17.810\nany kind of subnetting there.\n\n84\n00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.810\nIf you modify that subnet mask, remember,\n\n85\n00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.520\nyou'd have to go ahead and really\nlook at it from a binary perspective\n\n86\n00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.200\nto see the difference between that host\nportion and the network portion there.\n\n87\n00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.320\nYeah that's actually a good point for\nus to make, but\n\n88\n00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.490\nas a straight up example right\nnow we'll remember this, right?\n\n89\n00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.850\nWhat we're talking here is taking\na look at the subnet mask.\n\n90\n00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.780\nIf you'll remember that all of those that\nhave all binary ones which is what the 255\n\n91\n00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.150\nrepresents in each subnet,\nin each octet excuse me.\n\n92\n00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.880\nWell, the ones that begin and\nend with all zeros,\n\n93\n00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.570\nthat's gonna be our host ID portion.\n\n94\n00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.664\nSo, in this particular network here,\n\n95\n00:05:54.664 --> 00:06:00.305\nI just need to make sure that the fourth\noctet is the only one that I need.\n\n96\n00:06:00.305 --> 00:06:05.097\nNow, Cherokee is right in this sense,\nis that not everyone is going to be this\n\n97\n00:06:05.097 --> 00:06:09.893\neasy, where you'll always see where it\nends exactly along those octet lines\n\n98\n00:06:09.893 --> 00:06:14.686\nthat you normally see where the first\n24 bits of a 32 bit address is gonna be\n\n99\n00:06:14.686 --> 00:06:19.430\nthe network and then the last 8\nbits is gonna be the host instead.\n\n100\n00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.660\nThere are times where you will see\na single block of addresses like this one\n\n101\n00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.410\nhere, which is actually the 192.168.1.0\nnetwork where that can be sub divided,\n\n102\n00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:36.370\nor the idea of just division into\nmultiple, but smaller networks.\n\n103\n00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.759\nAnd that is a technical term that we use\nof course, that we call subnetting, right?\n\n104\n00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:42.915\nSo, if you've learned Vision,\n\n105\n00:06:42.915 --> 00:06:47.920\njust like we have all throughout our\ntime that we spent in elementary school,\n\n106\n00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.850\nor primary school at some point well\nit's the same thing but done in binary.\n\n107\n00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:56.559\nThat's essentially what subnetting\nis doing, but because you and\n\n108\n00:06:56.559 --> 00:07:00.201\nI did not learn how to probably work\nwith binary numbers as a child,\n\n109\n00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:04.180\nit becomes much more difficult\nas we're learning about it now.\n\n110\n00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.661\nBut, it does follow rules,\nit does follow a pattern.\n\n111\n00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:12.069\nAnd in networking, it's really\nessential that we understand, and\n\n112\n00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:16.629\ninside of a Cisco CCNA, and\nactually all throughout your CCNA, CCNP,\n\n113\n00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:22.118\nsubnetting and the ability to understand\nwhat devices belong together on a network.\n\n114\n00:07:22.118 --> 00:07:26.969\nAnd what devices do not belong together,\nare going to be very important for\n\n115\n00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:29.900\nanything that you face as a challenge.\n\n116\n00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:35.270\nBecause, we do tend to see a lot\nmore subnets in the realm of Cisco\n\n117\n00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.910\nin terms of odd subnets.\n\n118\n00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.930\nNot like the one that I showed here,\nbut different ones.\n\n119\n00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.740\nAnd you have to be able to\nidentify those machines\n\n120\n00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.030\nwhether they're on the same network.\n\n121\n00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.180\nOr whether they're not on\nthe same network as well, okay?\n\n122\n00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.457\nSo, let's go and talk about some of\nthe characteristics in within a subnet.\n\n123\n00:07:51.457 --> 00:07:55.763\nSo, another thing that we also have\nhere is that every single network.\n\n124\n00:07:57.905 --> 00:08:05.024\nEvery network has 2 Special addresses,\nokay?\n\n125\n00:08:05.024 --> 00:08:07.780\nAnd we have to make sure\nthat we remember this.\n\n126\n00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:13.380\nAgain, basic networking, but\na good reminder for us, okay?\n\n127\n00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.870\nSo of course, when we start talking about\nthat idea of what every single one has,\n\n128\n00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.990\nthere of course is what we call\nthe Network Address itself.\n\n129\n00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.221\nNow, there is an irony here, right?\n\n130\n00:08:24.221 --> 00:08:26.662\nWe've already talked about a Network ID,\nand\n\n131\n00:08:26.662 --> 00:08:29.235\nthat's also what you'll\nhear it described as.\n\n132\n00:08:29.235 --> 00:08:35.720\nSo this is kinda the general portion\nof that, which is the Network ID here.\n\n133\n00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.726\nSo that is kinda the biggest\ngrouping that we have.\n\n134\n00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:43.450\nA subnet or a network is essentially\na group of IP addresses.\n\n135\n00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.696\nAnd this one is actually\na little bit easy, I say easy,\n\n136\n00:08:46.696 --> 00:08:49.742\nif you know binary,\na little bit easy to identify.\n\n137\n00:08:49.742 --> 00:08:53.010\nBut the way that you actually\nidentify the network address here is,\n\n138\n00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:57.390\nyou can't depend on seeing the numbers,\njust like what Cherokee was saying.\n\n139\n00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:02.173\nSo for instance, that may actually\nbe part of the same network that we\n\n140\n00:09:02.173 --> 00:09:06.637\nwere talking about, or\nit may actually not be, for all we know.\n\n141\n00:09:06.637 --> 00:09:09.710\nAnd so\nthat's why the subnet mask is important.\n\n142\n00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:13.349\nThe Network Address, the easiest\nway to identify this, if you can,\n\n143\n00:09:13.349 --> 00:09:14.993\nis to take a look at the binary.\n\n144\n00:09:14.993 --> 00:09:22.233\nAnd when you talk about the idea\nof the Network Address or\n\n145\n00:09:22.233 --> 00:09:27.471\nthe Network ID itself, this is where all\n\n146\n00:09:27.471 --> 00:09:32.880\nthe Host ID bits are binary zeros, okay?\n\n147\n00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:38.843\nSo if you take a look at that portion of\nthe address and you were to turn 192.168.1\n\n148\n00:09:38.843 --> 00:09:44.980\ninto binary, well, you would get it\nones and zeros, combination of those.\n\n149\n00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.880\nThe Host ID portion of that 32-bit address\n\n150\n00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.420\nwould actually be a contiguous string\nof all zeros, with no interruptions, or\n\n151\n00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.280\nnothing inserted in\nbetween in terms of ones.\n\n152\n00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.260\nSo that is actually very key for us,\n\n153\n00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:04.960\nbecause that's the beginning of where\na network actually can be divided.\n\n154\n00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:10.101\nThe other address that's also in every\nsingle network is gonna be what we\n\n155\n00:10:10.101 --> 00:10:16.260\ncall the Broadcast ID, Okay, or\nthe broadcast address, either one.\n\n156\n00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:23.747\nAll right, Cherokee, so\n\n157\n00:10:23.747 --> 00:10:29.000\nlet's hope this idea of describing\nthis works for us in this way.\n\n158\n00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.107\nSo if I were to say, hey,\nthe network address,\n\n159\n00:10:33.107 --> 00:10:38.052\nall binary zeros, okay,\nis what we have in the host bit.\n\n160\n00:10:38.052 --> 00:10:41.725\nThe Broadcast Address, then, even\nthough all the Network ID is the same,\n\n161\n00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:46.190\nwhat do you think all the host bits\nwould be, all the Host ID bits would be?\n\n162\n00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.880\n&gt;&gt; All ones?\n\n163\n00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.090\n&gt;&gt; All ones, exactly.\n\n164\n00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:51.919\nSo see, just even if you go,\nI've never taken a look at that binary,\n\n165\n00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:53.319\nI don't know what it is.\n\n166\n00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:57.236\nBut in contrast, right,\nthen you know that hey,\n\n167\n00:10:57.236 --> 00:11:00.723\nall the Host ID bits-\n&gt;&gt; Ronnie, I had a 50/50 shot there.\n\n168\n00:11:00.723 --> 00:11:02.011\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; I mean, we've got zeros or\n\n169\n00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:02.929\nwe've got ones, so.\n\n170\n00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:04.312\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n171\n00:11:04.312 --> 00:11:06.899\nWell, you got it right,\nthat's all that matters, right?\n\n172\n00:11:06.899 --> 00:11:10.750\nAre all ones, and\nthat is very important as well.\n\n173\n00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:15.380\nBecause these are two addresses\nthat cannot be assigned to any\n\n174\n00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.970\nother device on our network, okay?\n\n175\n00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.100\nYou cannot assign\nthe Network ID to my computer.\n\n176\n00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.820\nI can't assign a Broadcast ID\nto Cherokee's computer and\n\n177\n00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.520\nexpect them to work.\n\n178\n00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.430\nOne represents, of course,\nthat entire network that I'm on.\n\n179\n00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:36.010\nThe other one represents a Broadcast ID,\nwhich is a special address that we use\n\n180\n00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:40.050\nfor, again, the idea of\nbroadcasting traffic across, well,\n\n181\n00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.670\neverybody else inside that same network.\n\n182\n00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:46.280\nSo these are two special\naddresses that you'll also find.\n\n183\n00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.048\nSo that means that if you, Cherokee,\n\n184\n00:11:49.048 --> 00:11:54.768\nwere to come across a machine that wasn't\nable to communicate on the network.\n\n185\n00:11:54.768 --> 00:11:59.797\nAnd I said, I manually assigned\nevery single address, Cherokee.\n\n186\n00:11:59.797 --> 00:12:03.290\nI know that I did them all right.\n\n187\n00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:04.600\nAnd then you came across one, well,\n\n188\n00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.639\nyou would actually maybe have\nto be able to eliminate it.\n\n189\n00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:08.940\n&gt;&gt; I'd have to bring you the bad news.\n\n190\n00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.664\nYeah, say, Ronnie, I think, yeah.\n\n191\n00:12:10.664 --> 00:12:14.287\nAnd it's kind of interesting, because it's\nalways going to be in the same location\n\n192\n00:12:14.287 --> 00:12:15.880\nwithin that address space, right?\n\n193\n00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.941\nSo we look at that first address,\nthose available within that IP range, and\n\n194\n00:12:19.941 --> 00:12:22.169\nthat's going to be the Network Address.\n\n195\n00:12:22.169 --> 00:12:25.010\nAnd then the broadcast\nshould be the last address.\n\n196\n00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.080\nSo only the usable or\n\n197\n00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.670\nsignable IP addresses are gonna fall\nin between these two IP addresses.\n\n198\n00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.220\n&gt;&gt; And that's a great way to\nactually think about that idea,\n\n199\n00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:39.560\nis that in between that, then, we can\nactually kind of do one other thing here.\n\n200\n00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.776\nSo the very first assignable address,\n\n201\n00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.539\nIf I can spell assignable,\nI think that's right.\n\n202\n00:12:49.539 --> 00:12:53.269\nThat looks weird, but\nI think that's right, assignable address.\n\n203\n00:12:54.490 --> 00:13:00.403\nThis is where all the Host bits,\n\n204\n00:13:00.403 --> 00:13:05.878\nID bits, are zeros except for\n\n205\n00:13:05.878 --> 00:13:08.506\nthe last one.\n\n206\n00:13:11.975 --> 00:13:17.781\nAnd that's a one, Is a one.\n\n207\n00:13:17.781 --> 00:13:22.556\nSo if you were to have, let's say, for\nexample, eight binary bits, okay, and\n\n208\n00:13:22.556 --> 00:13:23.835\nthey were all zeros.\n\n209\n00:13:23.835 --> 00:13:27.000\nAnd then your Host ID, you would know\nthat that would be your Network ID.\n\n210\n00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.110\n&gt;&gt; So as far as terminology goes, Ronnie,\n\n211\n00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:33.860\nI've heard a couple different things\nsuch as the least significant bit there.\n\n212\n00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.320\nOr even the delta,\nyou might see it in some textbooks.\n\n213\n00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.495\n&gt;&gt; Very nice, yes!\n\n214\n00:13:38.495 --> 00:13:40.966\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Some very technical understanding there\n\n215\n00:13:40.966 --> 00:13:43.066\nin terms of binary math, very good.\n\n216\n00:13:43.066 --> 00:13:46.441\nSo the other thing that you have here,\nright, is that if you have all\n\n217\n00:13:46.441 --> 00:13:50.610\neight zeros, you know that that's your\nHost ID or your Network ID, right?\n\n218\n00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.170\nBut if everything is zero, so\nyou have seven zeros in a row.\n\n219\n00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:57.484\nAnd the least significant, the one\nthat's at the end, is a binary one,\n\n220\n00:13:57.484 --> 00:14:01.185\nthat's gonna be your very first\nassignable address as well.\n\n221\n00:14:01.185 --> 00:14:04.888\nSo that also means, then,\nthat we have this chance and\n\n222\n00:14:04.888 --> 00:14:09.092\nthis opportunity about the last\nassignable address as well.\n\n223\n00:14:09.092 --> 00:14:13.579\nAnd this is where all the HostID,\n\n224\n00:14:13.579 --> 00:14:18.320\noops, I gotta stop doing all that\ntyping and talking at the same time.\n\n225\n00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.810\nIt's not helping me out here.\n\n226\n00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:25.269\nAll of the Host bits are,\nwell, ones this time, oops,\n\n227\n00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:30.043\nones, [LAUGH] except\nthe least significant one.\n\n228\n00:14:36.294 --> 00:14:40.080\nFor the last, that is a zero.\n\n229\n00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:44.650\nAll right, so it's kind of neat.\n\n230\n00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:49.206\nAnd what we're saying is that then, on\nthis particular network, right, that means\n\n231\n00:14:49.206 --> 00:14:53.656\nthat if the first assignable address on\nthe host bit portion, eight bits, right?\n\n232\n00:14:53.656 --> 00:14:57.750\nSeven zeros and then a one,\nthat's your first assignable address.\n\n233\n00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:02.440\nThe very last one is when\nyou actually go to all ones.\n\n234\n00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.680\nAnd then the eighth and\nthe last one is all zeros, okay, or\n\n235\n00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.200\nis one zero, excuse me.\n\n236\n00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.138\nNow, you might be wondering,\nhow in the world does that work out?\n\n237\n00:15:11.138 --> 00:15:12.690\nWhy am I not seeing this?\n\n238\n00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:16.446\nWell, let's just take for an example,\nand I'll try and type it out here.\n\n239\n00:15:16.446 --> 00:15:21.890\nAnd this is just the host ID portion for\nus, so that we can see it, okay?\n\n240\n00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:26.960\nSo we just take a look at the last ID,\nwell, one, two, three, four.\n\n241\n00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.820\nWe're not gonna do all of this, but\nthis way you can kind of see it.\n\n242\n00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.610\nI wish they would line up nice and\npretty for us,\n\n243\n00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:35.880\nbut apparently they're not going to.\n\n244\n00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.783\nAll right, so this is what you'll\nactually begin to see as we start to take\n\n245\n00:15:41.783 --> 00:15:43.953\na look here, as just an example.\n\n246\n00:15:46.387 --> 00:15:50.064\nSo you can see as it continues on,\nright, so there's the binary portion.\n\n247\n00:15:50.064 --> 00:15:58.160\nSo the very last one that I can assign\nbefore I get to all ones here, right?\n\n248\n00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.169\nSo at some point, we have,\nwe'll just put a dot, dot, dot in between.\n\n249\n00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:04.323\nThen would be all [INAUDIBLE]\neverything but that.\n\n250\n00:16:04.323 --> 00:16:09.240\nSo that's where we get that idea of\nwhat the last assignable one is.\n\n251\n00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.710\nThe problem that you're gonna have\nis that they're not always gonna be\n\n252\n00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.740\nalways exactly these, right?\n\n253\n00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.558\nYou might find out in some of them,\n\n254\n00:16:16.558 --> 00:16:20.133\nyou only have four bits left, or\nthree bits left or seven bits left or\n\n255\n00:16:20.133 --> 00:16:24.480\nwhatever it might be and that is when\nwe get into the realm of subnetting.\n\n256\n00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.240\nNow if you're uncomfortable with\nsubnetting, you need to make sure you go\n\n257\n00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:33.030\nback and review the CCENT series,\nas well as the CCNA routing series too.\n\n258\n00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.805\nYou might even wanna hit up the network\nplus series inside the library.\n\n259\n00:16:35.805 --> 00:16:37.860\n&gt;&gt; I think net plus covers that as well,\nyeah.\n\n260\n00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because all of those\nare really gonna help you on the exam.\n\n261\n00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.150\nThey're not gonna say,\ncan you tell me everything.\n\n262\n00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.071\nBut it might be very easily on the exam,\nwhere you'll get one or\n\n263\n00:16:47.071 --> 00:16:48.294\ntwo questions like this.\n\n264\n00:16:48.294 --> 00:16:49.440\n&gt;&gt; Worked in there.\n\n265\n00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, where it's worked in, and\nit's very important because it means\n\n266\n00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:57.190\nyou know exactly how\nthe binary addressing works.\n\n267\n00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:58.480\nIf you can't figure that out,\n\n268\n00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.340\nyou need to be able to very quickly\nwhen it comes down to Cisco exams.\n\n269\n00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.486\nThat's pretty much the key.\n\n270\n00:17:03.486 --> 00:17:04.350\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's the key word.\n\n271\n00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:08.270\nIf you're not dealing with working\nat the binary math every single day,\n\n272\n00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.150\nit's kind of like a skill and\nyou can get a little rusty at it.\n\n273\n00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.780\nI'm guilty.\n\n274\n00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:16.050\nSo if you were to ask me right now,\nI might have to or\n\n275\n00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.050\na calculator, that little notepad.\n\n276\n00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:22.340\nBut unfortunately when you're doing in\nthe matter of minutes within the exam,\n\n277\n00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:23.930\nevery little precious moment counts.\n\n278\n00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:27.750\nAnd so that's why just repetition and\npracticing really come in handy here.\n\n279\n00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:32.170\n&gt;&gt; And there is nothing else that I\ncan tell you that's really gonna be\n\n280\n00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:36.830\nas helpful as understanding whatever\nquestions that you choose to get.\n\n281\n00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.980\nFor example, if you end up using\nthe transcender exams and stuff like that.\n\n282\n00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.420\nOr whatever it might be,\nwhatever practice exams that you want.\n\n283\n00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.490\nIt doesn't matter what time\nlimit that they give you for\n\n284\n00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:48.890\nthe exam, your goal is fairly simple,\n\n285\n00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:53.970\nespecially when it comes down to things\nlike this, is a minute per question.\n\n286\n00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.850\nSo even if you get it right and it takes\nyou ten minutes and you count it wrong.\n\n287\n00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:00.870\nEven in your own head you just\ncounted wrong [INAUDIBLE] and\n\n288\n00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.820\nas long as you're actually in\nthat minute or less category,\n\n289\n00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:08.730\nthat is when you know that you're\nreally ready for your Cisco exams.\n\n290\n00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.520\nAnd I'm not trying to scare you,\n\n291\n00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.610\nI'm just trying to tell you the reality\nof this because exams are expensive.\n\n292\n00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:17.540\nAnd I want you to be able\nto succeed like crazy.\n\n293\n00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.483\n&gt;&gt; Be successful, yeah.\n\n294\n00:18:18.483 --> 00:18:20.480\n&gt;&gt; And\nif you think about this particular exam,\n\n295\n00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.230\nit can be between 55 to 60 questions.\n\n296\n00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.390\nYou can get at least three of this,\n\n297\n00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:29.547\nvery quickly here like this is within the\nsame network or is this a broadcast idea.\n\n298\n00:18:29.547 --> 00:18:32.610\n&gt;&gt; Why is the device not\ncommunicating with the other device?\n\n299\n00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:33.190\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n300\n00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:36.930\nIt might be very quick where\nyou can lose points very much,\n\n301\n00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:40.750\nso by you not knowing some\nof the simple binary math.\n\n302\n00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.780\nSo here's just kind of the basic idea.\n\n303\n00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.200\nSo within a single subnet then or\n\n304\n00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.840\nwithin a single network, all the devices\nthat are on that same IP network,\n\n305\n00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:53.850\nlike what we talked about, all of\nthe network IDs are exactly the same.\n\n306\n00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:57.730\nDevices should be able to communicate\nwithout any trouble at all,\n\n307\n00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.500\nas long as of course they\nare connected together somehow.\n\n308\n00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.700\nUsing a switch, using a hub, or\n\n309\n00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.394\nwhatever it might be,\nthat they're all directly connected.\n\n310\n00:19:05.394 --> 00:19:10.200\nBut, Cherokee, that's not the only type\nof connection that we tend to use, right?\n\n311\n00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.010\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; The idea of us just communicating with\n\n312\n00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:15.630\neach other is great, but there's times\nwhen we have to communicate with\n\n313\n00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.490\npeople that are outside\nof our network as well.\n\n314\n00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.181\nAnd we need to talk about-\n&gt;&gt; Most of the time, yeah,\n\n315\n00:19:20.181 --> 00:19:21.780\ncompanies have that option.\n\n316\n00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.029\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we need to talk about that.\n\n317\n00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:24.662\nWe need to talk about well,\n\n318\n00:19:24.662 --> 00:19:30.060\nnow that we understand that there has to\nbe communication within a network, okay?\n\n319\n00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.880\nWhat about between networks and\nwhat happens there, too, okay?\n\n320\n00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.100\nSo that is also where we want to\nstart to move and start to realized.\n\n321\n00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.890\nIf now there is another network\nthat I have to deal with,\n\n322\n00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:46.125\nhow is it that my computer knows\nexactly how to send that data\n\n323\n00:19:46.125 --> 00:19:50.510\nonto a network that it might not\nhave ever connected to before?\n\n324\n00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.900\nAnd that is another key\naspect of IP addressing.\n\n325\n00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.940\nSo, what do you think?\n\n326\n00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.880\n&gt;&gt; Well, we kind of spoke about\n[INAUDIBLE] and binary ending.\n\n327\n00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:07.983\nSo, this is where that subnet mask act as\nalmost like a translator for that router.\n\n328\n00:20:07.983 --> 00:20:12.299\nSo it can identify that belongs\nto the local area network or\n\n329\n00:20:12.299 --> 00:20:16.050\nneeds to send the data to another network.\n\n330\n00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no doubt and\nthat's actually very good for us.\n\n331\n00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.520\nIs now we actually have to say hey,\n\n332\n00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:25.610\nbetween subnets, okay,\nwhat do we need to have between subnets?\n\n333\n00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:29.210\nWe've already described when we start\nworking with different networking devices.\n\n334\n00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:33.510\nThat router pretty much seems to be\nthe device that we need to have.\n\n335\n00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.400\nBut what is really so\nimportant about the router.\n\n336\n00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.310\nSo, now I've got all my devices\nconnected to a switch, Cherokee.\n\n337\n00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.750\nI now bring this router and\nI go all right,\n\n338\n00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.060\nI've got a router on my network now.\n\n339\n00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:44.700\nBig deal.\n\n340\n00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.950\nIt doesn't seem to actually work that way,\nwhere we just plug it in and\n\n341\n00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:48.940\nit just work, right?\n\n342\n00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.720\nThere may be some configuration, there may\nbe some concepts that we have to make sure\n\n343\n00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.850\nthat we understand and\nwe get on there too.\n\n344\n00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:58.050\nSo when it comes down to us\ncommunicating between subnets here,\n\n345\n00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.400\nokay, there's two possibilities, okay?\n\n346\n00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.350\nAnd this is when we start talking\nabout the idea of what, routing, okay?\n\n347\n00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:08.010\nWhen we actually start to send\ndata between networks then,\n\n348\n00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:12.540\nwe have to route the data from\nmy network over to your network.\n\n349\n00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:16.520\nWhen you start doing stuff like that,\nthere's two possibilities then, okay?\n\n350\n00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.620\nAnd the reason why I'm\nfocusing on just those,\n\n351\n00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:24.330\nright, is because we're talking about IP\naddressing and that's actually key, okay?\n\n352\n00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:30.590\nOne is what we call a default route, okay?\n\n353\n00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:33.660\nAnd of course, the other one is\njust a straight up well, route.\n\n354\n00:21:36.951 --> 00:21:43.755\nAnd routing tables, okay, and\nthis can be statically assigned or\n\n355\n00:21:43.755 --> 00:21:48.870\nstatically programmed or\nDynamically learned.\n\n356\n00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.276\nIf I can spell it.\n\n357\n00:21:53.276 --> 00:22:00.610\nAll right, so let's talk about this\nidea of the default route first, okay.\n\n358\n00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.790\nEvery single device on your network.\n\n359\n00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.370\nAs long as it communicates only with\nother devices inside your network,\n\n360\n00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:11.470\nyou don't ever have to worry about\nhow to get outside of the network.\n\n361\n00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.080\nBut the time that you do,\n\n362\n00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.210\nthat is when it's really important\nthat you understand this concept.\n\n363\n00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:17.560\nThe easiest way for me to show that,\n\n364\n00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.940\nlet me see if I can bring\nup my network adapter here.\n\n365\n00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:23.090\nOops, that's probably not the easiest way.\n\n366\n00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:26.430\nThere we go.\nNetwork preferences,\n\n367\n00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:27.620\nI couldn't remember what\nit was called here.\n\n368\n00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.299\nSo let's take a look at\nsomething like this.\n\n369\n00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.250\nAnd I'll zoom in for a moment, okay.\n\n370\n00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:36.910\nSo here in the realm and\n\n371\n00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:42.160\nI'm running on the MacBook, you'll\nsee different names for this, right.\n\n372\n00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.590\nSo in the Windows world,\nwe call this what?\n\n373\n00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:46.360\nThis says Router.\n\n374\n00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.510\nWhat would we call this, Cherokee?\n\n375\n00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:48.280\n&gt;&gt; Default Gateway.\n\n376\n00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.200\n&gt;&gt; We call it Default Gateway.\n\n377\n00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:53.260\nHere on this MacBook,\nthey call it router, okay?\n\n378\n00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:57.010\nInside of Cisco world you may hear\nthe term default gateway, but\n\n379\n00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.700\nyou may hear the term\ndefault router as well.\n\n380\n00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.050\nAll those mean the exact same thing.\n\n381\n00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:05.610\nSo at this particular point\nwhen we start seeing this,\n\n382\n00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.620\nremember that we also talked\nabout addressing in itself.\n\n383\n00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:13.770\nEvery address has not only of course an IP\naddress, but it also has its Subnet Mask.\n\n384\n00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:19.290\nFor us to be able to well, use names,\nwe also need name servers.\n\n385\n00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:20.790\nHere is a couple of them.\n\n386\n00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:23.659\nThat's being kind of great out there, but\n&gt;&gt; Google?\n\n387\n00:23:23.659 --> 00:23:25.280\n&gt;&gt; Nor assigned.\n\n388\n00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.610\nBut notice this router id.\n\n389\n00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:29.910\nSo what is that router id about?\n\n390\n00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.150\nThat tells that my machine right now.\n\n391\n00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:40.180\nThat if it's not sending data to anything\nin the 10, because of the 255s here.\n\n392\n00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.837\n&gt;&gt; On that network.\n&gt;&gt; Yep, 46 network and\n\n393\n00:23:41.837 --> 00:23:46.600\nnotice the host portion here is\nall zeros on the subnet mask.\n\n394\n00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:51.589\nWhich means this last octet is all zeros\nor actually anything that it can be, okay?\n\n395\n00:23:51.589 --> 00:23:55.950\nSo that means that on this network,\nthat's fine.\n\n396\n00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.220\n&gt;&gt; But you gotta see this guy first.\n\n397\n00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.137\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n398\n00:23:58.137 --> 00:23:59.851\n&gt;&gt; If you want to send data out of this\n\n399\n00:23:59.851 --> 00:24:04.091\nnetwork, Think about this as being the key\nto the doorway out of your own network.\n\n400\n00:24:04.091 --> 00:24:04.710\n&gt;&gt; Good analogy.\n\n401\n00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:05.846\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty much key, right.\n\n402\n00:24:05.846 --> 00:24:06.531\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n403\n00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:10.565\n&gt;&gt; So if you do not know, where am I\nsupposed to send this data to, if it's on\n\n404\n00:24:10.565 --> 00:24:15.330\n47.0, well it actually looks around and\nif it doesn't have this router it goes,\n\n405\n00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:18.392\nI don't have a clue where to\nsend that information to.\n\n406\n00:24:18.392 --> 00:24:19.913\n&gt;&gt; I say the troll on the bridge.\n\n407\n00:24:19.913 --> 00:24:23.797\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and even when you do\nthat it doesn't go anywhere, but\n\n408\n00:24:23.797 --> 00:24:28.596\nhere it will be able to send it out and\nthen your router will take a look in that\n\n409\n00:24:28.596 --> 00:24:33.854\nrouting table to either find that you\nstatically routed the information saying,\n\n410\n00:24:33.854 --> 00:24:41.030\nhey if this is going to the 0.47 network,\nokay 10.0.47, sending out this interface.\n\n411\n00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:46.350\nIf this network is going to any place else\nsend it out to this interface as well, so\n\n412\n00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:50.220\nall of this is very possible but\nthat router ID is important.\n\n413\n00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:56.240\nNow I always, when I'm doing labs I\nassign .1, people assign, you can use\n\n414\n00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.890\nwhatever number that you want to, as long\nas it's not assigned to any other device.\n\n415\n00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:04.780\n&gt;&gt; Sure, in a business environment,\nit's very common practice for\n\n416\n00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.070\npeople to kind of pick something and\nstick with it, like a common theme, so\n\n417\n00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.951\nthat you're not confusing your co-workers.\n\n418\n00:25:09.951 --> 00:25:14.960\n&gt;&gt; Right, and you'll also see once again,\nwhen you get into the realm of subnetting,\n\n419\n00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:21.060\nokay it will not always be a .1, I only\ndo it as the first address inside to that\n\n420\n00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:26.820\nsubnet, so you might find out that your\nvery first number might be some like 49 or\n\n421\n00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:30.810\na nine or something like that,\nyou might end up seeing that as well.\n\n422\n00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:34.330\nSo all that's actually very important\nwhen we start to take a look\n\n423\n00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:36.860\nat some the information that we see there,\nokay?\n\n424\n00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:41.860\nSo being able to route between networks,\nthis is what we also have to\n\n425\n00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:46.990\nmake sure that we have on hand to\nunderstand what has to go on, okay?\n\n426\n00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:50.980\nSo as just kind of a simple idea and\n\n427\n00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:54.230\nconcept here in terms\nof inside of a network,\n\n428\n00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.842\nwe've already talked about that and\nyou do need to be very proficient,\n\n429\n00:25:57.842 --> 00:26:02.890\nokay at being able to identify\na several things here.\n\n430\n00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:06.144\nAnd we're gonna come back after we,\ncuz I'm running out of time here,\n\n431\n00:26:06.144 --> 00:26:07.338\nwe're gonna come back and\n\n432\n00:26:07.338 --> 00:26:10.999\nwe're gonna do a little bit of a quiz\nis what we're gonna end up doing.\n\n433\n00:26:10.999 --> 00:26:12.070\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; But for us,\n\n434\n00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:16.118\nwe want to make sure that we understand\nat least these things we talked about,\n\n435\n00:26:16.118 --> 00:26:19.358\nthat every single network right,\nis gonna have a network ID,\n\n436\n00:26:19.358 --> 00:26:21.131\nit's gonna have a broadcast ID.\n\n437\n00:26:21.131 --> 00:26:25.109\nWe need to know what the assignable\naddresses are, we need to understand that\n\n438\n00:26:25.109 --> 00:26:29.147\nby default they can communicate with each\nother and then if you are going to move\n\n439\n00:26:29.147 --> 00:26:33.270\nthat data off of your network,\nthere's not already a direct route.\n\n440\n00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.530\nYou're gonna also need a default router or\n\n441\n00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:39.710\na default gateway to help you out\nto make sure every node has it and\n\n442\n00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:44.570\nthat's also key, it can can't just be\nassigned at the router, okay that's it.\n\n443\n00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:48.149\nEvery single device that needs to\ncommunicate outside of the node,\n\n444\n00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:52.228\nwill have to have it configured on your\nmachine or on those machines just like I\n\n445\n00:26:52.228 --> 00:26:55.643\nhave it on mine and this is where\nthe importance of DHCP comes in.\n\n446\n00:26:55.643 --> 00:26:57.650\n&gt;&gt; Was gonna say,\nwe just spoke about that the other day.\n\n447\n00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:02.550\n&gt;&gt; Yep, so with the idea of DHCP,\nit really helps because it means I don't\n\n448\n00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:06.110\nhave to worry about making sure\nthat SSI on every machine, the DHCP\n\n449\n00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:09.865\nserver can take care of it as long as\nI understand those fundamentals there.\n\n450\n00:27:09.865 --> 00:27:15.120\nSo that's a good little review for what\nwe have, but we're gonna actually test\n\n451\n00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:20.630\nout our own knowledge on just a quick quiz\nthat will also have in just a little bit\n\n452\n00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:25.805\nof time, but for this particular episode\nthough, I've pretty much run out of time.\n\n453\n00:27:25.805 --> 00:27:28.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Ronnie, well thank you for\ngoing ahead and introducing us to\n\n454\n00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:32.710\nthe basics here, you got me shaking in\nmy boots, I don't know what's headed or\n\n455\n00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:37.310\nin store for the next episode, but stay\ntuned so you guys can find out as well.\n\n456\n00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.670\nI think we are out of time for\nthis particular show so\n\n457\n00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:43.670\nlet's go ahead and sign off, remember,\nI'm your show host Cherokee Boose.\n\n458\n00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:44.650\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n459\n00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:47.873\n&gt;&gt; See you next time, here at ITProTV.\n\n460\n00:27:47.873 --> 00:27:54.135\n[MUSIC]\n\n461\n00:27:54.135 --> 00:27:57.014\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for

00:00:10.316\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:15.230\n&gt;&gt; Hello, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.950\nI'm your host Mike Roderick, and\ntoday we're doing penetration testing.\n\n6\n00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.560\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at a very common attack\n\n7\n00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.920\nvector that we see out there in the wild.\n\n8\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.420\nAnd a really fun one to kinda work with.\n\n9\n00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.390\nBut a tricky one, is SQL Injection.\n\n10\n00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.610\nAnd here to make the mysterious\nless mysterious is Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.020\nDaniel Lowry, welcome back Daniel.\n\n12\n00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.350\n&gt;&gt; Hey Mike, how's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.720\nYes, we are moving into the realm of\nSQL Injection ladies and gentlemen.\n\n14\n00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.560\nGlad to be back in the studio with you\nguys cuz we're continuing on with our\n\n15\n00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.470\npenetration testing series.\n\n16\n00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.130\nAnd if, I say this a lot,\nif you've ever set some security and\n\n17\n00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.520\nhopefully if you're here\nwatching this you probably have.\n\n18\n00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.510\nMight have done something security plushes\nor along those lines, learned about some\n\n19\n00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.430\nsecurity and that's what sparked you\ninto wanting to watch this series.\n\n20\n00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.250\nAnd if you've done that,\nif you've initiated a bit into security,\n\n21\n00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.480\nyou've heard about SQL Injection.\n\n22\n00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.000\nBecause, like Mike said,\nit's a very common attack factor.\n\n23\n00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.580\nBut it also is a little weird, okay?\n\n24\n00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.840\nAnd when I say weird what I mean is,\nbasically,\n\n25\n00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.952\nyou're taking the bowl of spaghetti and\nyou're throwing it against the wall.\n\n26\n00:01:19.952 --> 00:01:23.150\nAnd going, something stuck there,\nokay great,\n\n27\n00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.358\nlet's try that, let's continue\ndown that line of reasoning.\n\n28\n00:01:26.358 --> 00:01:31.850\nIt's an art more than a science really,\nat least initially.\n\n29\n00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.220\nAnd once you get past that,\nthe fact that a SQL\n\n30\n00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.530\ninjection is possible then it starts\nbecoming more of science than an art.\n\n31\n00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.420\nSo, initially trying to find\nsites that are SQL injectionable,\n\n32\n00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.220\nthat's a good way to say it.\n\n33\n00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.810\nVulnerable to sequel problems, then you\n\n34\n00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.510\ncan get in to using your knowledge\nto sequel to exploit the machine.\n\n35\n00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.190\nSo, let's start here.\n\n36\n00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.230\nLet's talk about what exactly is a sequel\ninjection, set the stage really quickly.\n\n37\n00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.680\nSequel injection is basically\ntrying to find a web app or\n\n38\n00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.060\na website that basically\nis running SQL queries.\n\n39\n00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.170\nIt allows you to input and\nthat input becomes part of the SQL query.\n\n40\n00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.880\nAnd then it queries the database,\nand the database returns results and\n\n41\n00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.560\nit gets formatted appropriately and\nbecomes the output to a website.\n\n42\n00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.480\nThat's it, soup to nuts, start to finish.\n\n43\n00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.180\nThe problem comes in when,\nas always, unsanitized input,\n\n44\n00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.230\nthey're not checking what\nkind of input is going in.\n\n45\n00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.952\nIf you don't do that, well then I can\nsay well don't put that in there,\n\n46\n00:02:37.952 --> 00:02:42.910\nput this in there and it okay,\nthis isn't proper area for me to look for\n\n47\n00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.590\nsomething that I'm going to add\nto a SQL query, so I'll take it.\n\n48\n00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.100\nSo if you're not checking there,\nthat can definitely cause you problems.\n\n49\n00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.920\nOf course what does that do?\n\n50\n00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.360\nIt allows us to issue arbitrary\nSQL commands to our website there.\n\n51\n00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.010\n&gt;&gt; So really it's not a problem\nwith the SQL server in this case.\n\n52\n00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.850\nI mean the SQL server's doing what it's\nsupposed to do, processing commands,\n\n53\n00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.590\nthe problem is why did\nthat website let me,\n\n54\n00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.230\na visitor,\nissue a command in the first place.\n\n55\n00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.360\n&gt;&gt; Right, nail in the head.\n\n56\n00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.560\nMike's exactly right.\n\n57\n00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.380\nThe SQL server has no issue,\n\n58\n00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.740\nit's the front end to that server\nthat is causing the problem.\n\n59\n00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.860\nIt's allowing you, as a non-admin,\nto input SQL data or commands.\n\n60\n00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.410\nAll right, so\nthat was what the problem was.\n\n61\n00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.760\nWhere can you do this?\n\n62\n00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.370\nYou can do this in\na couple of ways any time,\n\n63\n00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.540\nif you have may be like an input box.\n\n64\n00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.580\nUsually we see this in form of a user and\n\n65\n00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.795\na password fields,\nsomething of that nature.\n\n66\n00:03:40.795 --> 00:03:44.450\nMaybe if you're asked,\nit has like a drop down menu and\n\n67\n00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.590\nhas a few different options available for\nyou.\n\n68\n00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.820\nThose could be part of a SQL statement,\nso when you choose your language or\n\n69\n00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.550\nsomething of that effect, it actually\nputs language equals da da da da\n\n70\n00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.620\ninside of that SQL statement and\nqueries accordingly, okay.\n\n71\n00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.840\nSo you can see it there.\n\n72\n00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.010\nYou can see it in just anywhere there's an\ninput field or input to the site itself.\n\n73\n00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.086\nOr it's just straight in to the URL,\nwhich we will actually use quite a bit.\n\n74\n00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:17.129\nWe're gonna start with very simplistic\nSQL injection so that we can get and\n\n75\n00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:22.348\nidea what its look like, how it reacts,\nwhat happens and move on from there.\n\n76\n00:04:22.348 --> 00:04:26.716\nActually, I have three SQL\nservers running right now and\n\n77\n00:04:26.716 --> 00:04:29.997\nthey all three have\ntheir own web front in.\n\n78\n00:04:29.997 --> 00:04:32.285\nI grab these guys from vonehub.com.\n\n79\n00:04:32.285 --> 00:04:36.075\nDon't forget to go on there and grab\nthese so that you can follow along and\n\n80\n00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:37.420\nplay with us.\n\n81\n00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.771\nThey will be the kioptrix,\nit's a weird one,\n\n82\n00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:48.357\nthe K-I-O-P-T-R-I-X machines and\nI got, 1.1, 1.2 and\n\n83\n00:04:48.357 --> 00:04:53.394\n1.3, which are oddly named\nwhen you fire them up.\n\n84\n00:04:53.394 --> 00:04:55.991\nKioptrix two, three and four.\n\n85\n00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:57.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So yeah.\n\n86\n00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.440\nIt can definitely twirl your\nhead around a little bit,\n\n87\n00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.430\nit was fun going, hold on what's going\non again, keeping things straight.\n\n88\n00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.430\nI also made in my Linux machine,\nI went into the Etsy host file.\n\n89\n00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.540\nAnd I'm gonna show you that really\nquickly cuz it's a good thing to do.\n\n90\n00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.920\nIt helps so\nyou don't have to work with ip addresses.\n\n91\n00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.380\nIf you go up in,\nyou should do something like cat or\n\n92\n00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.044\nif you wanna open it nano/etsy/hosts.\n\n93\n00:05:25.044 --> 00:05:30.610\nJust made some entries there just\nlike that you put the ip address.\n\n94\n00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.060\nAnd then a space and\nwhatever you wanna call it.\n\n95\n00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.380\nI just call it a kioptrix-3,\nkey kioptirx-1, and kioptrix-4, so\n\n96\n00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.310\nI can easily just use those names\ninstead typing on an IP address.\n\n97\n00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.980\n&gt;&gt; Very smart.\n\n98\n00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so do that, it'll help you out,\nAlt Ctrl x over there.\n\n99\n00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.990\nWhat else do I want you guys to know about\nthese boxes, I think that's about it.\n\n100\n00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.280\nJust get them in your environment, fire\nthem up, download them from vulnhub, and\n\n101\n00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.530\nthey will help us with this you can\nfollow along and do what we're gonna do.\n\n102\n00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.410\nSo let's start with kioptrix,\nlooks like number one here.\n\n103\n00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.700\nSo what we're gonna do is I'm\ngonna open up my browser.\n\n104\n00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:10.140\nAnd of course we've done all our\ntypical scanning and enumeration right.\n\n105\n00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.530\nWe've run nmap -a -t4.\n\n106\n00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:18.190\nAll ports we found that is running a web\nsite and also maybe that they're SQL.\n\n107\n00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.600\nMaybe we've run nitko against it.\n\n108\n00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.930\nNikto, I always say it nitko, it's nikto.\n\n109\n00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.312\nI'm dyslexic so help me out here.\n\n110\n00:06:26.312 --> 00:06:28.910\n[LAUGH] Run that scan,\nlook for vulnerabilities.\n\n111\n00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.560\nWell I saw some SQL entries on that, so\nthere we go, I know sequel is running.\n\n112\n00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.110\nSo let me fire that guy up here.\n\n113\n00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:42.625\nJust to browse the http:// and\nthen it was, h, yeah.\n\n114\n00:06:42.625 --> 00:06:47.410\nKioptrix-.com, like that.\n\n115\n00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.762\nAnd there you go, it's a simple page, cuz\nwe're gonna do something very simple and\n\n116\n00:06:51.762 --> 00:06:53.630\nwe have to input fields.\n\n117\n00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.530\nOne's a username, one's a password.\n\n118\n00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.040\nAnd this is where I talk about\nthat whole scatter gun approach,\n\n119\n00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.780\nthe throwing the spaghetti on the wall.\n\n120\n00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.260\nIs I'm just gonna try some SQL and\nsee what happens, all right,\n\n121\n00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.880\ncuz that's a lot what we do, right.\n\n122\n00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.640\nJust to see if it works.\n\n123\n00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:13.050\nYou can check out, look for\nSQL injection cheat sheets.\n\n124\n00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.610\nJust do a Google search for that.\n\n125\n00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.760\nI think pentestmonkey has some on there.\n\n126\n00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.140\nHe's got a good list of that.\n\n127\n00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.740\nExploit DB also has a good one.\n\n128\n00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.020\nI'll put the links to\nthat in the show notes so\n\n129\n00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.670\nyou can peruse those cheat sheets.\n\n130\n00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.480\nI'm sure they're not\nthe only game in town.\n\n131\n00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.600\nFind ones that you like.\n\n132\n00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.170\nMaybe there's some that are more thorough,\nsome that are less thorough.\n\n133\n00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:35.440\nMaybe there are, you find a site that has\nthem and they make more sense to you.\n\n134\n00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.260\nIt just depends on teaching methods and\nstyles.\n\n135\n00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.180\nSo I'll find you a cheat\nsheet that can very helpful.\n\n136\n00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:45.050\nAnd you can just start throwing these\nthings at your input and see if they work.\n\n137\n00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.140\nAnd that's it,\nthat whole scattergun approach.\n\n138\n00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.109\nIf I go to the username portion here and\n\n139\n00:07:51.109 --> 00:07:54.836\nI just say, blah user, like that.\n\n140\n00:07:54.836 --> 00:07:56.379\nActually, I don't even need\nthat to be honest with you.\n\n141\n00:07:56.379 --> 00:08:01.107\nI'm just gonna add the single quote,\nSpace.\n\n142\n00:08:01.107 --> 00:08:07.080\nOr, 1 = 1, and then a hash, like that.\n\n143\n00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.650\nI hit Return, and look what it does.\n\n144\n00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.880\nIt allows me access into this\nbasic administrative console.\n\n145\n00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.520\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n146\n00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.420\nSo, Mike you know a bit about SQL here.\n\n147\n00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.190\nIt's interesting to know what's\ngoing on in the background.\n\n148\n00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:27.656\n&gt;&gt; It really is cuz I'm sure you're\ngonna show how we work through this,\n\n149\n00:08:27.656 --> 00:08:31.593\nwe're really trying to figure out what\nSQL statement they're using in the back\n\n150\n00:08:31.593 --> 00:08:34.470\nof this code as we're putting that,\nI think in this case,\n\n151\n00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:37.500\na little single apostrophe or\none equals one.\n\n152\n00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.040\nAnd we know with an or statement,\neither side has to ring true, right?\n\n153\n00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.630\nWe don't know username, or we might or\nmight not, or one equals one.\n\n154\n00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.420\nWell does one equal one?\n\n155\n00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.010\n&gt;&gt; Usually.\n\n156\n00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.470\n&gt;&gt; Usually in most math systems right?\n\n157\n00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:55.590\nSo even thought the username part didn't\nring true, the second part did and\n\n158\n00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.980\ntherefore it allowed me to continue on or\nif we could start to evaluate that SQL\n\n159\n00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.310\nstatement behind there and\nsee what we can do.\n\n160\n00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah what's interesting about\nthis as well is you get this cool\n\n161\n00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.380\nwelcome to the basic administrative web\nconsole ping machine on the network.\n\n162\n00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:11.890\nSo it's running ping.\n\n163\n00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:16.282\nSo if I say, you know,\ngive it it's own loop back address\n\n164\n00:09:16.282 --> 00:09:22.020\n127.0.0.1, like that, hit enter,\nit's trying to connect.\n\n165\n00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.540\nAnd cool, I get ping output.\n\n166\n00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.190\nSo what is it doing?\n\n167\n00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.410\nIt's running ping.\n\n168\n00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:30.910\nRemember we did a show and\nwe talked about command injection, right?\n\n169\n00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.610\nWell, if it's just doing ping in Linux,\n\n170\n00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:36.730\nI can use a semicolon and\nadd commands to it.\n\n171\n00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:43.870\nSo if I come back and I just do semicolon,\ncaps, FC slash password.\n\n172\n00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.030\nLet's see what happens.\n\n173\n00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.070\nHey look, there's the FC password file.\n\n174\n00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.775\n&gt;&gt; That was too darn easy.\n\n175\n00:09:50.775 --> 00:09:51.933\n&gt;&gt; That's a little too easy for us, right?\n\n176\n00:09:51.933 --> 00:09:54.160\nThat's fun stuff.\n\n177\n00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.050\nAnd there's some users,\nwe've got Harold, we've got John.\n\n178\n00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.820\nLot of cool stuff going on there.\n\n179\n00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:04.220\nInteresting things, there was great\ninroad into exploiting this machine.\n\n180\n00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.420\nVery cool stuff.\n\n181\n00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.140\nBut that was pretty simple.\n\n182\n00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.260\nLet's take a look at another one here.\n\n183\n00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.270\nLet me close these down.\n\n184\n00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.030\nIt's a very similar attack.\n\n185\n00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:19.900\nI'm gonna go to keoptricks4.com.\n\n186\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.460\nAnd again, very similar.\n\n187\n00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.760\nWe have a log in screen.\n\n188\n00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.720\nUsername and password.\n\n189\n00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.991\nI wonder if our little\nattack will work here?\n\n190\n00:10:27.991 --> 00:10:29.512\nWell we'll try it again, same kinda thing.\n\n191\n00:10:29.512 --> 00:10:34.029\nSingle quote, OR 1=1 # and\n\n192\n00:10:34.029 --> 00:10:41.420\njust put whatever in the password and\nhit login.\n\n193\n00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.940\nWrong username or password, okay.\n\n194\n00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.320\nWell maybe if I leave\nthe password part out.\n\n195\n00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:53.130\nIf I say single quote or one equals\none hash just leave the password out.\n\n196\n00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:59.410\nNow, so obviously the user\nname portion is looking for\n\n197\n00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.500\na certain string of data, right.\n\n198\n00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.850\nSo that's why that's not working,\nbecause I'm not able to or it's.\n\n199\n00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.020\nI'm not able to say this, or\n\n200\n00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.270\nthis, it's just saying,\nthis is what it should look like.\n\n201\n00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.800\nThis does not look like that.\n\n202\n00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.270\nSo that's bad, that's wrong.\n\n203\n00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.840\nAnd of course the password field\nwas either blank or wrong so\n\n204\n00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.450\nI'm getting that wrong.\n\n205\n00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:20.610\nBut what if I reverse the process, right?\n\n206\n00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.440\nWhat if I do that?\n\n207\n00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.170\n&gt;&gt; I really like it.\n\n208\n00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:23.950\n&gt;&gt; I do too.\n\n209\n00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:28.620\nNow with this obviously that\npassword area is looking for\n\n210\n00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.020\na specific, like an actual user again.\n\n211\n00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.840\nSo I would need to enumerate\nsome user accounts.\n\n212\n00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.391\nLet's give that a shot actually,\nI think that this would be\n\n213\n00:11:38.391 --> 00:11:43.035\na cool place to use DIR,\nDirBuster or GoBuster, whatever,\n\n214\n00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:48.880\nany one of those cool busters that\nbasically brute forces web directories.\n\n215\n00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:54.836\nRight, so let's do that because I found\nsome interesting stuff when I did that,\n\n216\n00:11:54.836 --> 00:11:56.610\nenumerating this box.\n\n217\n00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:02.669\nSo if I did did derb and\nI say http:// and I say kiorptix-4.com,\n\n218\n00:12:02.669 --> 00:12:09.564\nand then I say, I'm gonna use the big\nword file that they have, it basically,\n\n219\n00:12:09.564 --> 00:12:16.910\nit has a dictionary of words that it tries\nto use as common directory names, right?\n\n220\n00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:21.495\nSo I'm gonna use the big\nword file which is\n\n221\n00:12:21.495 --> 00:12:25.951\nlocated in user/share/wordlists and\n\n222\n00:12:25.951 --> 00:12:29.881\nI think it's big.tx big .txt,\n\n223\n00:12:29.881 --> 00:12:34.346\nno it's dirb/big.txt, there we go.\n\n224\n00:12:34.346 --> 00:12:38.987\nIt's generating the world list,\nit's gonna run through this thing,\n\n225\n00:12:38.987 --> 00:12:42.200\nI can't remember how long this takes.\n\n226\n00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.590\nCouldn't resolve host, what did I do?\n\n227\n00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:47.560\nI spelled keyoptics wrong,\nthat would be a problem.\n\n228\n00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.050\nIt is a twisty little,\nI don't know how to name this thing.\n\n229\n00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.372\nLet's keep up, tricks, let's try that.\n\n230\n00:12:54.372 --> 00:12:57.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Generating the word list.\n\n231\n00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.570\nAnd, hopefully it doesn't\ntake too very long.\n\n232\n00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.270\nThere we go.\nYou can see it kind of cranking through\n\n233\n00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.500\nall the words.\n\n234\n00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.510\nTrying to find, it found CGI Bin.\n\n235\n00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:09.700\nIt's found, here is a directory log out.\n\n236\n00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.430\nHere is another one, member.\n\n237\n00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.540\nOkay, that was pretty quick and\nit found five different directories.\n\n238\n00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:22.620\nAnd if I look through them I found one\ncalled John and one called Robert.\n\n239\n00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.610\nThose seem more like actual people,\n\n240\n00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.965\nlike I don't know why someone\nwould just name a directory John.\n\n241\n00:13:27.965 --> 00:13:30.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't know why someone would name\n\n242\n00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:34.260\na directory Robert other than they\nare users and they are their folders.\n\n243\n00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.390\n&gt;&gt; Definitely a good chance right?\n\n244\n00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:39.300\n&gt;&gt; Right, so definitely a good chance\nthat this might be two good users.\n\n245\n00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.100\nSo we'll try them.\n\n246\n00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:40.600\nLet's do that.\n\n247\n00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.330\nWe'll go here, we'll go back to try again.\n\n248\n00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:50.870\nAnd this time we will say John and then\nwhen we come down to the password area,\n\n249\n00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:56.230\nwe'll do our single quotation space or\n\n250\n00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:00.280\nspace one equals one space.\n\n251\n00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:06.140\nAnd your hash, hit return and\nnow I get my numbers\n\n252\n00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:10.350\ncontrol panel and it shows me the username\nand what his password actually is.\n\n253\n00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.010\nSo I have bypassed the law again.\n\n254\n00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:17.140\nSo my password field was not\nbeing sanitized very well even\n\n255\n00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.370\nthough they did with the username.\n\n256\n00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.350\nGod knows why they didn't\ndo it with the passwords.\n\n257\n00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.980\nBut they didn't and\nnow you can see how this works.\n\n258\n00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:27.550\nSo, giving you a good idea of getting\ninitiated into signal injection.\n\n259\n00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:31.320\n&gt;&gt; It might sound silly but you will\nfind that kind of thing out in the wild\n\n260\n00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.030\nwhere for some reason they just didn't\nget around to doing the other field or\n\n261\n00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.710\nthey mistakenly thought they were and\n\n262\n00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:42.740\nthey were not doing checks on\nthose inputs and it slips through.\n\n263\n00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:43.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it happens.\n\n264\n00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.390\nGuys are out there coding\ntrying to bang away.\n\n265\n00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.530\nHe's got somebody over their shoulder\ngoing, when's that gonna get done?\n\n266\n00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:49.790\nWe need that by tonight.\n\n267\n00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.410\nIs that gonna be done,\nis that gonna be done?\n\n268\n00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:52.780\nSo they're hurrying, they're rushing.\n\n269\n00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.310\nYou gotta remember we're all humans.\n\n270\n00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:59.750\nWe make mistakes and these things\nhappen but as the penetration tester,\n\n271\n00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:04.370\nwhereas the bad actor that's out there in\nthe wild, are looking for those mistakes.\n\n272\n00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.140\nOne's looking for those mistakes to\nrectify them, the other one's looking for\n\n273\n00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.860\nthem to exploit them.\n\n274\n00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.420\nSo there it is.\n\n275\n00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:16.210\nAnd again our caveat for the day is\ndon't perform these attacks on machines\n\n276\n00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:21.480\nthat you do not have authorization for\nor that you own explicitly.\n\n277\n00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.250\nSo there we go,\ndon't do bad things to people.\n\n278\n00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.920\nIt's not nice, you don't wanna end up in\na hotel with a guy with a stick going,\n\n279\n00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:31.015\nI'm gonna hit you in the head with this\nif you don't lay down to your sleep.\n\n280\n00:15:31.015 --> 00:15:33.010\n[LAUGH] If you don't go to\nsleep I will put you to sleep.\n\n281\n00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.300\nSo there we go, that was pretty\nstraightforward, pretty simple.\n\n282\n00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:43.240\nAnd usually when you see a SQL\ninjection type of talk or\n\n283\n00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.760\nteaching, that's about as\nfar as you usually get.\n\n284\n00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.500\nBut that's not the end of the game.\n\n285\n00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.200\nWe went down a little bit deeper.\n\n286\n00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.050\nLet's talk error based enumeration.\n\n287\n00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:54.470\nWhat is error based enumeration?\n\n288\n00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.672\nIt doesn't happen often, but\nsometimes you do something,\n\n289\n00:15:57.672 --> 00:16:01.186\nyou type something into input, or\nyou do something and it's not,\n\n290\n00:16:01.186 --> 00:16:04.671\nOr doesn't work correctly, and\nthe SQL Server throws an error.\n\n291\n00:16:04.671 --> 00:16:08.430\nAnd that error comes out on the website,\nright?\n\n292\n00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:13.150\nSo, you tried to type something in,\nit says, error, your syntax is wrong.\n\n293\n00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.130\nThis happens sometimes, not a lot,\n\n294\n00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.890\nbecause it's a bad idea to\nallows those things to happen.\n\n295\n00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.930\n&gt;&gt; But again, it's another one of\nthose things where it's another step.\n\n296\n00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:24.430\nAnd when you're in a rush, when you're\nin a hurry, you might not think about,\n\n297\n00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.240\nhey, do I need to capture these errors?\n\n298\n00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.979\nCuz most sites nowadays have\ngotten better about it, right?\n\n299\n00:16:29.979 --> 00:16:32.178\nAnd you get that little\nfriendly splash screen,\n\n300\n00:16:32.178 --> 00:16:35.630\noops sorry couldn't find\nthe page you were looking for.\n\n301\n00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:39.200\nBut now and again,\nyou still see the actual error come up.\n\n302\n00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.430\nAnd, as Daniel said,\nthere can be a lot of good information.\n\n303\n00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.710\nOr if we're the company\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n304\n00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.560\n&gt;&gt; Really sensitive information that is\n\n305\n00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.070\ngetting exposed to unauthorized viewers.\n\n306\n00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:50.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n307\n00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:52.575\nSo, if you do run across,\n\n308\n00:16:52.575 --> 00:16:56.190\nif you're ping testing,\nyou wanna try error based enumeration.\n\n309\n00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:00.630\nLook for\nerrors occurring from the website.\n\n310\n00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:04.920\nAnd if there's SQL, you see SQL,\nwell, now you know, well, I'm,\n\n311\n00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.990\nmaybe I can use that information to\nsuccessfully craft a SQL injection attack.\n\n312\n00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:14.330\nCuz it's giving you outputs that can\nlend you to realize these things.\n\n313\n00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:18.150\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes it'll even show you\nthe query that's being executed,\n\n314\n00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:21.430\nwhich is exactly what I need to\ncomplete a command or SQL injection.\n\n315\n00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:25.920\n&gt;&gt; Right, so let's take a look at what\na vulnerable server might look like.\n\n316\n00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.260\nI'm going to go to key objects three.\n\n317\n00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.080\nI know we're bouncing all over the place.\n\n318\n00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.690\nDaniel, one, three, or\nfour and what's going on here.\n\n319\n00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.800\nI know, it's a little twisty,\nbut you guys will get it.\n\n320\n00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.070\nAll right, so here's key objects three.\n\n321\n00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:44.510\nAnd we've got a blog,\nwe've got a login area.\n\n322\n00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.320\nDoing our enumeration, perusing.\n\n323\n00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.260\nRemember, when you're pen testing,\nthere is no link you don't follow, right?\n\n324\n00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.760\nThere is no path,\nno stone you wanna leave unturned.\n\n325\n00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.980\nYou follow everything.\n\n326\n00:17:54.980 --> 00:18:00.380\nAnd it did take me quite a while to\nfind an area, cuz I'm looking for\n\n327\n00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:06.080\nSQL injection, and\nall the stuff seem to be SQL problems.\n\n328\n00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:10.130\nThere were other things that caught my\neye, but I'm looking specifically for SQL.\n\n329\n00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:11.065\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm like,\n\n330\n00:18:11.065 --> 00:18:14.390\nthis thing does not seem to\nhave any real SQL difficulties,\n\n331\n00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.595\nat least not from manual enumeration.\n\n332\n00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:17.865\nI could have done something else,\n\n333\n00:18:17.865 --> 00:18:20.575\nrun a vulnerability scanner against it,\nmaybe that would find it for me.\n\n334\n00:18:20.575 --> 00:18:24.245\nBut I'm trying to do it\nthe old fashioned way, right?\n\n335\n00:18:24.245 --> 00:18:24.825\nThe hard way.\n\n336\n00:18:24.825 --> 00:18:29.983\nSo I'm moving around through here, and\nwe get this cut to the chase, see it now.\n\n337\n00:18:29.983 --> 00:18:31.985\nThey're talking about their\nnew revamped website.\n\n338\n00:18:31.985 --> 00:18:34.827\nI click on that, and it takes me\nto do this really cool website,\n\n339\n00:18:34.827 --> 00:18:36.500\nif that's what you wanna call them.\n\n340\n00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.510\nGive us a little more,\nI guess this is as low as that goes.\n\n341\n00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.620\nWe got these goats,\n\n342\n00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:44.080\nthis handsome young devil right\nhere all decked out to the nines.\n\n343\n00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.580\nPictures all over the place.\n\n344\n00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:53.220\nSee over here, our URL is on the gallery,\nso I'm just gonna click on a picture.\n\n345\n00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.400\nOf course, I get this guy here.\n\n346\n00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.580\nLet's see here, why [INAUDIBLE].\n\n347\n00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:03.610\nI see why, because the web link\nitself is a little messed up.\n\n348\n00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:05.460\nSo I can look at,\nthere we go, show you guys.\n\n349\n00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.950\nNotice I'm hovering over the picture and\nit's saying keyoptics3.com.\n\n350\n00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.820\nYou know what I'm gonna do to fix that?\n\n351\n00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.370\nI'm gonna edit that file,\nthat etsy host file.\n\n352\n00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:21.120\nReally quickly, nano,\ncuz it wants kioptrix3, not kioptrix-3.\n\n353\n00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.362\nForgive me, kind sir.\n\n354\n00:19:22.362 --> 00:19:22.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; /etc.\n\n355\n00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:28.170\nI was just trying to stay consistent\nwith my naming conventions here, but\n\n356\n00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.440\nthey will have none of it.\n\n357\n00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.950\nGo in here, change that.\n\n358\n00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:37.380\nThere we go, and then Ctrl+O,\nCtrl+X to save that.\n\n359\n00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.780\nNow let's try going to that.\n\n360\n00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.420\nThere we go,\nnow things are working correctly.\n\n361\n00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:47.140\nSo I was clicking through here and\nI'm looking at, I tried this ratings area.\n\n362\n00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.280\nI thought, maybe that ratings,\n\n363\n00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.290\ncuz it's got some cool stuff\nin the URL down here below.\n\n364\n00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.310\nIf you guys can see that,\nshowing you all the URL stuff.\n\n365\n00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:59.300\nThis is what was kinda catching my eye,\nthis vote.phpid=3.\n\n366\n00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.570\nSomething like that,\n\n367\n00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.430\nthat's definitely what you wanna look for,\nthings of that nature.\n\n368\n00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.600\nSo I'm gonna click back in, and\nwe'll zoom back out really quickly.\n\n369\n00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.910\nWhere was it that I went?\n\n370\n00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:12.800\nI think I, let me go back.\n\n371\n00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.640\nI got into one area, this gallery area.\n\n372\n00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.760\nHere we go.\n\n373\n00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.070\nI was looking through here and\nI noticed the sorting options right here.\n\n374\n00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:25.444\nClicked on that, and\nI just clicked on Photo ID.\n\n375\n00:20:25.444 --> 00:20:29.781\nAnd then when I did that,\nI noticed up here,\n\n376\n00:20:29.781 --> 00:20:34.530\nI got PHP id equals one and sort photo id.\n\n377\n00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:35.630\nThat was what caught my eye,\n\n378\n00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:40.850\nthat was what,\nthat photo id equals something, right?\n\n379\n00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:45.170\nI thought good spot,\nmaybe a SQL injection could be an issue.\n\n380\n00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.660\nJust a test, right?\n\n381\n00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.360\nThere's no input box here, right?\n\n382\n00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.078\nBut there is something going\non there with that id=1.\n\n383\n00:20:52.078 --> 00:20:54.500\nSo I'm just gonna erase that out.\n\n384\n00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.560\nAnd I'm just gonna add a semicolon, right?\n\n385\n00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.770\nBecause remember,\nsemicolons are used in transact-SQL.\n\n386\n00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:01.666\nSo let's see.\n\n387\n00:21:01.666 --> 00:21:04.240\nI just hit Return, and I get an error.\n\n388\n00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.099\nI was like [SOUND] finally,\nI found a good spot!\n\n389\n00:21:07.099 --> 00:21:11.709\nYou have an error in your SQL syntax, so\nwe're getting errors from the machine.\n\n390\n00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.060\nCorresponds to your SQL server, and\n\n391\n00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.020\nit tells you where the error\nis in here and all that.\n\n392\n00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:18.700\nThat's good for me.\n\n393\n00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:23.770\nNow I know,\nlet's try hitting it with some actual SQL.\n\n394\n00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.290\nSo I'm gonna take that out.\n\n395\n00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:29.580\nNow I'm gonna try using an order.\n\n396\n00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.210\nNow, if I didn't get an error,\nthat doesn't mean I'm out of the game.\n\n397\n00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:35.090\nIt just means I gotta try\na different technique, right?\n\n398\n00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:37.950\nAnd then, if that technique doesn't work,\nthen I'm out of the game, right?\n\n399\n00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:41.720\nThen SQL injection's not gonna\nbe my platform of attack.\n\n400\n00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.550\nWe would try blind SQL injection,\nwhich we're gonna get to.\n\n401\n00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:48.670\nSo if that didn't work, I will show you\nhow to continue testing, all right?\n\n402\n00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.750\nBut for here, we do, we get errors.\n\n403\n00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:53.790\nSo I can get responses\nfrom the SQL Server.\n\n404\n00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:59.672\nI'm gonna try order by, and\nthen I'll just say 1--, like that.\n\n405\n00:21:59.672 --> 00:22:03.310\nThat dash is basically like\neverything after this is a comment.\n\n406\n00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.570\nSo hit Return, and\nyou guys know SQL, right?\n\n407\n00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:07.160\nYou guys are SQLs.\n\n408\n00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.060\nYou'll notice that I got no errors.\n\n409\n00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:14.830\nThat means what, Mike?\n\n410\n00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.820\n&gt;&gt; That means they liked it, it worked.\n\n411\n00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.208\n&gt;&gt; That's right, exactly.\n\n412\n00:22:18.208 --> 00:22:21.380\nIf it doesn't get an error, that means\nmy SQL statement went through and\n\n413\n00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.380\nit was fine with it,\nit didn't have a problem.\n\n414\n00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.130\n&gt;&gt; And I think you did what you did\nthe dash dash, right, on that one?\n\n415\n00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:26.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, which is,\n\n416\n00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.470\nif you guys know your SQL, as Daniel was\nsaying, comments out everything else.\n\n417\n00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:34.630\nSo you're just saying, hey, here,\nrun this, and then ignore anything else\n\n418\n00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.900\nthe website might be adding,\njust ignore it completely.\n\n419\n00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.840\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n420\n00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.910\nSo, now that we know that we can do that,\nwhat I wanna do is I wanna find out\n\n421\n00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:45.520\nwhere's a good spot for me to actually\nreach into the SQL database and\n\n422\n00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.210\npull data out of there so\nthat I can see them?\n\n423\n00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:53.660\nI wanna know where are these tables and\ncolumns occurring in the website?\n\n424\n00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:58.530\nSo we can continue to use our SQL\ninjection to figure those things out.\n\n425\n00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.180\nNow, what we'll do is\nwe'll do that by using our\n\n426\n00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.340\nUNION ALL SELECT statement, right?\n\n427\n00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:06.740\nSo, UNION ALL, and then SELECT.\n\n428\n00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.100\nNow, we do have to find out exactly\nhow many columns there are.\n\n429\n00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.740\nWe can't have the wrong amount, we have\nto use the exact amount of columns there.\n\n430\n00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.320\nSo we have to do a little bit of testing.\n\n431\n00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.640\nLet me show you how to do that.\n\n432\n00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.480\nGo back into my URL here.\n\n433\n00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:23.510\nTake my order by out and\ndo union all select.\n\n434\n00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.400\nLike that.\nAnd then say one.\n\n435\n00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:27.900\nHit return.\n\n436\n00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.590\nHere, I get the you select statement\nhave different number of columns and\n\n437\n00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:33.860\ncould not select the category.\n\n438\n00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:38.190\nSo, the error is actually telling me I\ndidn't use the right number of columns.\n\n439\n00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:39.480\nI need to continue, okay?\n\n440\n00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.060\nI'm gonna continue doing that, too.\n\n441\n00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.920\nSo I just comma two, no spaces.\n\n442\n00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.460\nTry that.\n\n443\n00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.693\nStill getting an error.\n\n444\n00:23:47.693 --> 00:23:53.040\nBecause I've done this,\nI will got to 6 and hit Return.\n\n445\n00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.661\nNow you see that things are working.\n\n446\n00:23:54.661 --> 00:24:00.348\nI know that there's 6 because when\nI go to 7 I get an error, right?\n\n447\n00:24:00.348 --> 00:24:03.050\nSo if I'm getting an error,\nit's the wrong amount of columns.\n\n448\n00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:05.610\nWhen I hit the right amount of columns,\nI get the website.\n\n449\n00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:12.010\nNot only do I get the website but\nif I go to 6, right 6, there it is.\n\n450\n00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:15.030\nYou'll notice that, instead of\nthe information that was there before,\n\n451\n00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:18.350\nwe get this 2 and 3, right here.\n\n452\n00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.340\nI know this says 3, but that's\nan actual number of photos over here.\n\n453\n00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:25.139\nWhat this is doing is it is showing me\nwhere column 2 and column 3 actually are.\n\n454\n00:24:25.139 --> 00:24:28.040\nIt's displaying that information.\n\n455\n00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.300\nSo now I know where I can output my info.\n\n456\n00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.730\nVery, very cool stuff, right?\n\n457\n00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:34.810\nSo, what can I do with that?\n\n458\n00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:39.190\nBasically, I say in column 2,\nI add some more SQL, right?\n\n459\n00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:40.534\nI can add some more SQL in column 3.\n\n460\n00:24:40.534 --> 00:24:44.850\nSo let's take a look at\nwhat that looks like.\n\n461\n00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.071\nLet me make sure I follow my notes here.\n\n462\n00:24:47.071 --> 00:24:48.993\nHate when the notes cut off on a page.\n\n463\n00:24:48.993 --> 00:24:49.980\nIt's always fun.\n\n464\n00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.690\nSo we've gotten through that.\n\n465\n00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:54.590\nWhat are we gonna do next?\n\n466\n00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:56.260\nLet's try the version.\n\n467\n00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.160\nWhat version of SQL are we using?\n\n468\n00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:05.140\nSo I can go into my URL and say,\nin column 2, just erase the 2, @@version.\n\n469\n00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:06.660\nLike that.\n\n470\n00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:13.158\nHit Enter, and\nyou'll notice it says 5.0.51a-3Ubuntu5.4.\n\n471\n00:25:13.158 --> 00:25:13.875\nSo pretty cool.\n\n472\n00:25:13.875 --> 00:25:18.588\nI could have put that version in 3, and\nit would have gone in the 3 column.\n\n473\n00:25:18.588 --> 00:25:20.725\nSo, starting to get enumeration, right?\n\n474\n00:25:20.725 --> 00:25:23.319\nWe're still really enumerating the box.\n\n475\n00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.100\nLet's see here.\n\n476\n00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.020\nMoving on down the pipe.\n\n477\n00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.650\nLet's see who we're running as.\n\n478\n00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:32.569\nWho's the user?\n\n479\n00:25:32.569 --> 00:25:34.470\nLet's try that.\n\n480\n00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.581\nUser, I think it's like that, is it?\n\n481\n00:25:37.581 --> 00:25:38.098\nIs that correct?\n\n482\n00:25:38.098 --> 00:25:38.982\nYeah, there we go.\n\n483\n00:25:38.982 --> 00:25:39.718\nRoot at local.\n\n484\n00:25:39.718 --> 00:25:40.568\nWell, so that's interesting.\n\n485\n00:25:40.568 --> 00:25:44.247\nIt's always a nice thing to know, so\nI'm issuing these statements as root.\n\n486\n00:25:44.247 --> 00:25:46.339\nAt least that's what it says I'm doing.\n\n487\n00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.530\nThat's a good sign.\n\n488\n00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:50.810\nNow we need the table enumerate.\n\n489\n00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:56.180\nWe need to find out what tables\nare available to us in this database.\n\n490\n00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:01.103\nSo what I can do, is I can come in\nhere and I can say, what is it?\n\n491\n00:26:01.103 --> 00:26:02.345\nIt is table name, right?\n\n492\n00:26:02.345 --> 00:26:06.260\nTable_name, like so and\n\n493\n00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:12.590\nthen go to the end of that column\nenumeration area and just say from.\n\n494\n00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.841\nYeah, from information,\n\n495\n00:26:17.841 --> 00:26:23.452\nI cannot spell mation_schema.tables.\n\n496\n00:26:23.452 --> 00:26:26.300\nLike that, you start looking through here.\n\n497\n00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.970\nYou start to see it's giving\nme every one of the tables\n\n498\n00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.780\nthat is available in that database.\n\n499\n00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.770\nSo we've got columns that's a good one.\n\n500\n00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:36.230\nI definitely want to enumerate that.\n\n501\n00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:41.480\nAll these different things going on here.\n\n502\n00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:47.930\nProfiling, a lot of tables,\nmore tables, table privileges.\n\n503\n00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:50.910\nSo I think that, there's a user table,\nthat's interesting.\n\n504\n00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.210\nThis one's actually really tricky.\n\n505\n00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:54.850\nThe person that set this up was devious.\n\n506\n00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:56.517\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because they got me, and\n\n507\n00:26:56.517 --> 00:26:57.310\nthey got me good.\n\n508\n00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:59.470\nAnd I'll show you where\nin just a second here.\n\n509\n00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:00.550\nLet's crank forward.\n\n510\n00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:02.990\nNow that we know that table's up,\nlet's do columns.\n\n511\n00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:04.070\nSee the column names.\n\n512\n00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.703\nColumns, Daniel.\n\n513\n00:27:07.703 --> 00:27:10.988\nColumn name dot columns.\n\n514\n00:27:15.112 --> 00:27:16.302\nLike so.\n\n515\n00:27:16.302 --> 00:27:21.184\nAnd actually, yeah, and\nI'll say what table because I'll show\n\n516\n00:27:21.184 --> 00:27:25.378\nyou something really funny here,\nlet's just do that.\n\n517\n00:27:25.378 --> 00:27:30.300\nHere's the columns, and\nas I was going through here,\n\n518\n00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.836\nI got down to the bottom, where was it?\n\n519\n00:27:33.836 --> 00:27:34.733\nWas it in this one or in tables?\n\n520\n00:27:34.733 --> 00:27:36.940\nThis is a lot of data.\n\n521\n00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.220\nBut as I got to the bottom,\nthere were, was it user?\n\n522\n00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.590\nYeah, so I had user.\n\n523\n00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:45.608\nI thought that's for user.\n\n524\n00:27:45.608 --> 00:27:49.840\nAnd then there was another one that was,\nI think password.\n\n525\n00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.820\n&gt;&gt; Pass maybe?\n\n526\n00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.352\n&gt;&gt; Right, let me see, I'm almost there.\n\n527\n00:27:52.352 --> 00:27:53.948\nOoh, I thought I passed it a little bit.\n\n528\n00:27:53.948 --> 00:27:58.823\nOffset, PACKED, PAGE, PAGE, PARAMETER,\n\n529\n00:27:58.823 --> 00:28:02.450\nso it must have been in the tables.\n\n530\n00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:04.220\nSo, there it is.\n\n531\n00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.457\nPassword, so I saw user and\npasswords and I thought great,\n\n532\n00:28:06.457 --> 00:28:08.120\nthat's the ones I wanna enumerate.\n\n533\n00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:08.909\nAnd man, did they get me.\n\n534\n00:28:08.909 --> 00:28:09.467\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n535\n00:28:09.467 --> 00:28:11.830\n&gt;&gt; Cuz nothing was coming out.\n\n536\n00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:15.275\nThere was no data coming in it because\nthere's no stinking data in them.\n\n537\n00:28:15.275 --> 00:28:19.531\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's another one called dev\n\n538\n00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:22.685\naccounts up here some ways.\n\n539\n00:28:22.685 --> 00:28:24.700\nThere's a lot of stuff in here.\n\n540\n00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.438\nAnyway, there's one called dev accounts,\ntrust me, it's there.\n\n541\n00:28:27.438 --> 00:28:32.010\nAnd then when I went back through it I\nsaid, well what's this dev accounts one?\n\n542\n00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:33.660\nAnd lo and behold,\nwe found some information.\n\n543\n00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.330\nSo let me show you that, how to do that.\n\n544\n00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:40.400\nIf I come in here,\nI wanna read that column info.\n\n545\n00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.880\nSo it is username and password.\n\n546\n00:28:45.397 --> 00:28:47.860\nSo those exist, so\nI'm gonna use column 2 for username.\n\n547\n00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:53.083\nUsername, and\nthen I'm gonna take 3 out and\n\n548\n00:28:53.083 --> 00:29:00.236\ncall it password cuz those were\ngood columns and good tables.\n\n549\n00:29:00.236 --> 00:29:04.491\nAnd I will say from the table\n\n550\n00:29:04.491 --> 00:29:09.118\ndev_accounts, like that.\n\n551\n00:29:09.118 --> 00:29:12.815\nAnd then once I did that,\nwe now see I've got a username,\n\n552\n00:29:12.815 --> 00:29:17.330\nI've got an encrypted password,\nthat's a hashed password.\n\n553\n00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:20.880\nBut there's two usernames and\npasswords that came out in those fields.\n\n554\n00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.048\nI can now copy and paste those, which is\nexactly what I did, if I come here and\n\n555\n00:29:25.048 --> 00:29:25.578\ndo an ls.\n\n556\n00:29:25.578 --> 00:29:30.165\nI got this creds.txt cat creds and\nI just copied them and\n\n557\n00:29:30.165 --> 00:29:35.350\nI shoved them through my password\ncracker and it was md5 hash.\n\n558\n00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:39.800\nThere's online md5 decreptors and\nwe were off to the races.\n\n559\n00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.170\nAnd I got those passwords.\n\n560\n00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:48.432\nFrom there, if I do a little endmap,\n\n561\n00:29:48.432 --> 00:29:53.079\nmap of kioptrics3.com,\n\n562\n00:29:53.079 --> 00:29:56.720\nI see the ssh is open.\n\n563\n00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.989\nAnd I can try to login with ssh or\n\n564\n00:30:00.989 --> 00:30:06.550\nwe will use that because it uses\nStar Wars, and I like that.\n\n565\n00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:08.498\n&gt;&gt; I knew you would.\n\n566\n00:30:08.498 --> 00:30:14.544\n&gt;&gt; I cannot spell, at kioptrics3.com.\n\n567\n00:30:14.544 --> 00:30:19.694\nThere is his password which is Star Wars\nwhich is all typed on one hand,\n\n568\n00:30:19.694 --> 00:30:20.853\noddly enough.\n\n569\n00:30:20.853 --> 00:30:23.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You don't use your right hand at all.\n\n570\n00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:23.930\nAnd I'm logged in.\n\n571\n00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:30.100\nAnd now I'm set up for a springboard into,\nwe looked at privilege escalation.\n\n572\n00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.110\nNot a root user.\n\n573\n00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:32.450\nI didn't try to pseudo anything,\n\n574\n00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:37.920\nbut I assume you'll have\nto in some way from here.\n\n575\n00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.810\nTo continue on to root,\nbut I was able to log in.\n\n576\n00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:43.620\nI've got Shell access.\n\n577\n00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:47.460\nI can continue my exploitation from\nthere all using what we learned\n\n578\n00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.560\nfrom enumeration through SQL.\n\n579\n00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.410\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is amazing stuff, Dan.\n\n580\n00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:54.004\nAnd we appreciate those\ngreat demonstrations,\n\n581\n00:30:54.004 --> 00:30:58.560\nreally shows you that with a little bit of\nknowledge of your Transact-SQL language,\n\n582\n00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.863\nas a pentester, you can take advantage of\nthe fact that they're not scrubbing or\n\n583\n00:31:02.863 --> 00:31:04.213\nvalidating that input.\n\n584\n00:31:04.213 --> 00:31:08.190\nAllowing those commands to be processed\nby the SQL server in the back end.\n\n585\n00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:12.893\nAnd that's never gonna be a good thing\nwhen you can let random public people fire\n\n586\n00:31:12.893 --> 00:31:16.020\nSQL [LAUGH] commands\nagainst your SQL server.\n\n587\n00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.214\nWhen I say SQL, understand I'm not saying\nSQL as in the Microsoft product, right?\n\n588\n00:31:19.214 --> 00:31:23.402\nWe're talking about Transact-SQL\nas a language and SQL,\n\n589\n00:31:23.402 --> 00:31:25.750\nStructure Query Language.\n\n590\n00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:30.011\nAnd just SQL database engines,\nof which Microsoft SQL is one, but\n\n591\n00:31:30.011 --> 00:31:34.653\nthere's also MySQL, and there's\nseveral other free and open source,\n\n592\n00:31:34.653 --> 00:31:39.319\nthat all use that same common language,\nthat Transact-SQL or T-SQL.\n\n593\n00:31:39.319 --> 00:31:44.008\nSo learning that is a big part of being a\ngood pentester, especially if you're gonna\n\n594\n00:31:44.008 --> 00:31:47.520\nwork with command line or\ncommand injection or SQL injection.\n\n595\n00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:51.010\nSo, Daniel, I know we got some\nmore SQL injection to do.\n\n596\n00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:53.994\nBut unfortunately, we are out of time for\nthis particular episode.\n\n597\n00:31:53.994 --> 00:31:55.730\nSo we're

welcome\nto another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.910\nI'm your host Daniel Lowry, and\nhere with me today is the ubiquitous,\n\n5\n00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.040\nthe man that knows everything about A+,\nRonnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.960\nHow's it going today Ronnie?\n\n7\n00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.200\n>> It is going well today, it's another\ngreat day to be here in the studio,\n\n8\n00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.960\ntaking a look at some A+ content,\nmaking sure that we understand some of\n\n9\n00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.960\nthe different hardware components that\nwe're gonna run into as A+ technicians.\n\n10\n00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.120\nSo today we're gonna\nspecifically look at RAM.\n\n11\n00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.607\n>> Ooo, Random Access Memory, right?\n\n12\n00:00:39.607 --> 00:00:40.107\n>> Random Access Memory.\n\n13\n00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.360\n>> I might know a thing or two.\n\n14\n00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.250\n>> Yes, very good Daniel.\n\n15\n00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.920\nRAM, we're gonna take a look at memory in\ngeneral, but really focusing in on RAM,\n\n16\n00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.290\nthe random access memory.\n\n17\n00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.680\nWhen we start working with computers,\nright.\n\n18\n00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.940\nIf you're new to the IT field and\nyou're just getting your feet wet and\n\n19\n00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.300\nyou never opened a computer before.\n\n20\n00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.550\nUsually one of the easiest things that\nyou'll end up replacing inside of\n\n21\n00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.330\nthe computer system is gonna be\nwhat we call the memory modules.\n\n22\n00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.000\nSo you'll hear the term memory modules,\nyou hear people call it sticks of RAM,\n\n23\n00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.230\nmodules of RAM, or just RAM,\nwhatever you might hear.\n\n24\n00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.750\nYou'll hear those terminologies, and\nwe're all talking about the same thing.\n\n25\n00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.420\nSo when a computer system starts up,\nright,\n\n26\n00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.240\nwhen you actually boot up a computer.\n\n27\n00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.510\nWhat's gonna end up happening is that\nyou're not really working off of the files\n\n28\n00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.250\nthat are stored on the hard drive,\nyou're normally working off of\n\n29\n00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.560\ninformation that's stored while\nin a temporary memory access.\n\n30\n00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.730\nIn other words, it's brought up into what\nwe call RAM, the Random Access Memory, and\n\n31\n00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.260\nso when you're interacting\nwith your computer,\n\n32\n00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.220\nyou're really interacting inside\nof RAM is what you're doing.\n\n33\n00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.890\nAnd I say, memory location that allows\nall the stuff to be displayed and\n\n34\n00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.680\nyou can interact with it.\n\n35\n00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.570\nAnd then later on when you do\nsomething like save a file,\n\n36\n00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.270\nit's gonna take what's in RAM and\nthen write it to the hard drive.\n\n37\n00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.970\nSo let's make sure we have\nan understanding of what memory actually\n\n38\n00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.080\nallows us to be able to do.\n\n39\n00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.190\nSo I went ahead and\nmade a diagram, hopefully,\n\n40\n00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.890\nto help us set this in\nstone a little bit better.\n\n41\n00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.050\nSo, what is memory?\n\n42\n00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.340\nWell, on your computer systems,\n\n43\n00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.150\nyou can run it at two different\ntypes of memory here.\n\n44\n00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.390\nThe first one is that random access\nmemory that Daniel telling us about and\n\n45\n00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.410\nthis is a dynamic work area for\nthe processor.\n\n46\n00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.110\nThat's the easiest way to think about it.\n\n47\n00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.110\nSo if you're not fairly familiar with it,\nthink about you actually saying, hey,\n\n48\n00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.880\nwe're going to a meeting and I need to\nmake sure that I can write notes as I need\n\n49\n00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.180\nto, and you're going to brings\nsomething like a scratch pad, right?\n\n50\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.480\nAnd that pad of paper as you write notes\ndown, as you do something like that,\n\n51\n00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.230\nlater on you're going to\ngo back to your desk and\n\n52\n00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.240\nactually put it down on something\na little bit more formal at that point.\n\n53\n00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.510\nBut think about it as scratch paper, as\nyou hear stuff you need to right it down,\n\n54\n00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.700\nmake sure you remember it a little bit\nlater, because you may actually now take\n\n55\n00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.880\nthat little piece of information\nthat you wrote down.\n\n56\n00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.670\nAnd now all of a sudden you're actually\nwriting something you know maybe\n\n57\n00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.160\na programming code.\n\n58\n00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.690\nMaybe it's a actually remembering, oh\nhere's a process I need to put into place,\n\n59\n00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.590\nor oh yeah, I need to write out this\nnote because I need to be sure I\n\n60\n00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.160\ncall this person and\nget that stuff ordered, whatever might be.\n\n61\n00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.670\nWell RAM essentially works like that for\nyour computing system.\n\n62\n00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.290\nAs applications are actually now\nloaded into RAM at the same time and\n\n63\n00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.320\nnow it's asking you to\nproduce some information.\n\n64\n00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.010\nWell you still have to\nwrite that stuff somewhere.\n\n65\n00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.580\nAnd we're going to actually\nput it in something that we\n\n66\n00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.250\ncall random access memory.\n\n67\n00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.530\nNow, the way that the RAM works, right?\n\n68\n00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.940\nIs that it is what we call volatile.\n\n69\n00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.930\nAnd what that means in terms of volatility\nis what I have here on this next slide.\n\n70\n00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.400\nInformation that you put into RAM,\nthat the computer puts into RAM\n\n71\n00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.900\nis gonna be there as long as\nelectricity is supplied to the system.\n\n72\n00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.440\nSo if you unplug the computer,\nif the power goes out,\n\n73\n00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.180\na lot of times what you actually\nhave stored in RAM just disappears.\n\n74\n00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.250\nNow Daniel I remember the earliest time\nthat this ever happened to me and I cried.\n\n75\n00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.940\nI literally cried.\n\n76\n00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.630\nI was in grade school, let's say 8th\ngrade or somewhere around there, and\n\n77\n00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.660\nI had a paper that I was typing and\nit was the first time I had actually used\n\n78\n00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.410\na computer instead of a typewriter for\ntyping a paper, for creating a paper.\n\n79\n00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.990\nWord Processor, and\nI didn't know anything about save.\n\n80\n00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.510\nAnd so there I was,\nI was typing this gigantic paper.\n\n81\n00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.040\nI say gigantic like four pages.\n\n82\n00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.500\nWasn't anything really\ngigantic to the eight grader.\n\n83\n00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.260\n>> To the eight grader it\nwas like a dissertation.\n\n84\n00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.827\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's like an encyclopedia, but\n\n85\n00:04:08.827 --> 00:04:11.188\nyou know it was a four page paper or\nsomething and\n\n86\n00:04:11.188 --> 00:04:14.450\nall of a sudden the power went out and\nmy friend said.\n\n87\n00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.310\nDid you save?\n\n88\n00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.130\nI was like, what does that mean?\n\n89\n00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.020\nAnd he says,\n\n90\n00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.910\nwell, what happens is that all the stuff\nthat you're writing, is no longer there.\n\n91\n00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.540\nI said, what do you mean,\nI typed it all in.\n\n92\n00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.750\nIt's there.\n\n93\n00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.650\nHe said, no,\n\n94\n00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.410\nhe said, when the power went out, if you\ndidn't save it to the disc, it's gone.\n\n95\n00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.480\nSo I had to actually spend\nthat entire night again,\n\n96\n00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.760\nrewriting that little four page paper.\n\n97\n00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.720\nAnd that's the first time I\nactually understood something.\n\n98\n00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.500\nThat what's actually in RAM isn't\nthere if the power goes out.\n\n99\n00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.030\nSame thing still happens on most of\nthe systems that we run today,is\n\n100\n00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.910\nif there's no electricity, it's out.\n\n101\n00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.830\nSo that's why I call it\na dynamic work area for\n\n102\n00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.940\nyour processor to do some of\nthings that it has to do.\n\n103\n00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.540\n>> Yeah, Ronnie, I've always heard\nit as called temporary storage.\n\n104\n00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.180\nRight?\nThey want to emphasize the fact that it is\n\n105\n00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.010\nnot a permanent place to put your files or\nanything that it reads into it.\n\n106\n00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.310\nIt's just there as a quick place holder so\n\n107\n00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.870\nthat you can quickly access stuff\nthat you've already accessed.\n\n108\n00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.890\nIt loads it into RAM and\ngives you the ability to access it,\n\n109\n00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.355\nthere's no moving parts in RAM.\n\n110\n00:05:12.355 --> 00:05:15.895\nIt's all at the digital level,\nso you don't have to,\n\n111\n00:05:15.895 --> 00:05:18.055\nyou move a like on your hard drive and\nthings like that.\n\n112\n00:05:18.055 --> 00:05:18.985\nIt's very quick, actually.\n\n113\n00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:19.935\nThat's why they do it this way.\n\n114\n00:05:19.935 --> 00:05:22.785\n>> Yeah, no, there's no doubt about\nit that on your computer system,\n\n115\n00:05:22.785 --> 00:05:26.705\nif you need to access something very\nquickly, it's easier to access it in RAM.\n\n116\n00:05:26.705 --> 00:05:28.565\nCuz if it's stored on your hard drive,\nthat means it has to go and\n\n117\n00:05:28.565 --> 00:05:31.000\nretrieve it off of your hard drive,\nfind where it is.\n\n118\n00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.020\nAnd then pull it back in if I\nhad to do that for every time.\n\n119\n00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.160\nWe probably should not be faster literally\nbringing our typewriter back out and\n\n120\n00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.300\nactually typing information because\nthat's what would have to happen.\n\n121\n00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.250\nBut the other type of memory that we have\non our computer system is also one that\n\n122\n00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.990\nwe call rom.\n\n123\n00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.230\nWhich stands for read only memory.\n\n124\n00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.990\nNow, if RAM is like a scratch pad right.\n\n125\n00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.430\nROM is actually instructions\nthat are burned into the chip so\n\n126\n00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.940\ninstead think about it as somebody\nprinting stuff out for you and saying\n\n127\n00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.080\nhere's the information that you need,\nand that information is not changing.\n\n128\n00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.250\nIt doesn't matter what you do, you can\nwrite little scratch notes on the side of\n\n129\n00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.610\nit, but overall the printing\nis actually what matters.\n\n130\n00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.960\nSo when your computer system first starts\nup it actually depends on, well ROM.\n\n131\n00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.930\nAnd in today's world you also\nhere the term firmware as well.\n\n132\n00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.020\nBut it's read only memory.\n\n133\n00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.930\nThat means at the factory\nthey burned in instructions\n\n134\n00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.470\nthat the computer systems needs to\nhave on hand when it first boots up.\n\n135\n00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.180\nAnd so it's on the chip itself.\n\n136\n00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.700\nThe best thing about something like\nROM is it doesn't require electricity\n\n137\n00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.200\nto keep the information on.\n\n138\n00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.760\nSo you turn the computer off,\nthose instructions are still there.\n\n139\n00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.530\nYou turn it back on,\nthose instructions are still there.\n\n140\n00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.630\nAnd our computer system uses\na combination of these things.\n\n141\n00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.570\nWe're starting to see more and more,\nespecially on these new systems.\n\n142\n00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.390\nNot only do we have it on\nthings like the motherboard,\n\n143\n00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.685\nbut we'll start seeing that\non like video adapter cards.\n\n144\n00:06:44.685 --> 00:06:48.285\nThey also have their own ROM, and even\nalso sometimes even on network adapters,\n\n145\n00:06:48.285 --> 00:06:52.285\nthey also have some information on them,\nand they're all stored in chips is what\n\n146\n00:06:52.285 --> 00:06:56.195\nthis type of memory's actually going\nto do for us and have available.\n\n147\n00:06:56.195 --> 00:06:59.455\nSo this is the way that we normally\ninteract with the computer,\n\n148\n00:06:59.455 --> 00:07:03.910\nis directly with the idea of RAM,\nand ROM here.\n\n149\n00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.520\nAnd usually for us, it's actually\nthe idea of RAM more than anything else.\n\n150\n00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.640\nSo on every computer system, then, there's\ngoing to be a limited amount of memory.\n\n151\n00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.200\nAnd that limitation is actually done\nby a couple of different things.\n\n152\n00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.470\nOne, it's really cost more\nthan anything else, right.\n\n153\n00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.100\nI can sit there and\n\n154\n00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.830\nsay Daniel, I want a computer that I\nwant to put 128 gigs of RAM into it.\n\n155\n00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.241\nWell, Daniel might say, okay,\nit's gonna cost you about $10,000.\n\n156\n00:07:28.241 --> 00:07:30.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now, I don't know what it would cost me\n\n157\n00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.250\nbut let's say it gonna cost a lot more\nthan what I'm willing to pay for it.\n\n158\n00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.220\nSo there's a limitation to that.\n\n159\n00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.160\nAnd then there's a physical limitation.\n\n160\n00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.380\nOn our motherboards,\nthere's only a limited amount of space.\n\n161\n00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.023\nAnd so that limited amount of space,\nthat means they only have,\n\n162\n00:07:45.023 --> 00:07:49.610\nthey put a limited amount of connectors on\nthe board to allow us to actually be able\n\n163\n00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.331\nto put additional RAM chips on them or\nRAM modules on them as well.\n\n164\n00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:57.634\nAnd also you have to be careful here too,\nas a technician, you have to understand\n\n165\n00:07:57.634 --> 00:08:02.086\nthat not all memory is fully compatible,\nso you can't just go all right, Daniel.\n\n166\n00:08:02.086 --> 00:08:03.530\nI want every old computer that you have.\n\n167\n00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:08.410\nI brought my brand new computer, I just\nneed to steal some RAM off that computer.\n\n168\n00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:09.640\nIt's just not gonna fit.\n\n169\n00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.130\nSo you have to be a little bit careful,\nand\n\n170\n00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.750\nthat's what an A+ technician\nalso has to be able to do.\n\n171\n00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.930\nWe're gonna see differentiations and\n\n172\n00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:20.220\nthings like what we call the different\ntypes of modules that we'll run into.\n\n173\n00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:24.285\nSo you'll hear the term DIMM, which\nstands for Dual Inline Memory Module.\n\n174\n00:08:24.285 --> 00:08:25.940\nWe'll actually showing\nthe example of that.\n\n175\n00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.135\nAn older term,\nI've actually added it in just for\n\n176\n00:08:28.135 --> 00:08:32.680\ncompletion's sake, cuz it's no longer\nreally called out on the exam any more,\n\n177\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.320\nbut things like RIMMs, which stand for\nRambus In-line Memory Modules.\n\n178\n00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.220\nAnd you also have of course a different\nnumber of pins on these types of modules.\n\n179\n00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.230\nDIMMs are by far the most\npopular ones that we see.\n\n180\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:47.600\nYou'll also see that on those memory\nmodule types not only do you have those\n\n181\n00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.110\nthings that are actually on their\nown little circuit board, but\n\n182\n00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.820\ndifferent types of chips\nthat are on them as well.\n\n183\n00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.722\nThere's things that we call DRAM,\nwhich stands for dynamic RAM.\n\n184\n00:08:55.722 --> 00:08:59.272\nAnd there's SDRAM which also stands for\nsynchronous dynamic RAM, there's so many\n\n185\n00:08:59.272 --> 00:09:03.250\ndifferent other ones that are out there\nand we'll talk about SO-DIMMs as well.\n\n186\n00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.200\nAnd then there's speed that\ncan actually be adjusted and\n\n187\n00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.840\nthen there are other things\nthat we call parity, and\n\n188\n00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.810\nwe'll kind of take a look at that\na little bit further on down the line.\n\n189\n00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:13.490\nBut you name it, in other words you\nactually have to make sure that if you're\n\n190\n00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.230\ngonna purchase RAM for\nsomeone's computer build,\n\n191\n00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.600\nright, that you do get\nthe right memory module type.\n\n192\n00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.470\nThat you actually are making sure it\nactually is compatible with the system\n\n193\n00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.450\nboard itself.\n\n194\n00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.490\nIf not, you're gonna have spent a lot of\nmoney, or a little bit of money at least\n\n195\n00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:30.200\nin today's day and age, and\nyou're not gonna use it on that board.\n\n196\n00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.780\nAnd it's just gonna sit\nthere in your shop.\n\n197\n00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.430\n>> Yeah, kind of a waste of\ntime to buy the wrong RAM.\n\n198\n00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:38.260\nIt's easy enough to just either consult\nthe documentation for your system.\n\n199\n00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.480\nSee what type of RAM it takes, so\nthat you can perform the correct upgrade.\n\n200\n00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.050\nOr, go to a lot of different websites that\n\n201\n00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.630\nwill allow you to put in what model\nof computer that you have, and\n\n202\n00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.860\nit will tell you this is the type of\nRAM that you need for that system.\n\n203\n00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.430\nA lot of people that sell RAM,\n\n204\n00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.070\nthey have those kind of databases\nusually set up on their websites.\n\n205\n00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:59.510\nMaking our job, it's not that hard,\n\n206\n00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:03.182\nwhere you're typically not looking at\na stick of RAM and counting pins out.\n\n207\n00:10:03.182 --> 00:10:05.047\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And going, okay, well,\n\n208\n00:10:05.047 --> 00:10:07.960\nobviously this is the SO-DIMM [INAUDIBLE].\n\n209\n00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.100\nNo, no, no.\n\n210\n00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.510\nYou just look up the type\nof system that you have and\n\n211\n00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:13.950\nit should come back with\nthe type of RAM you need.\n\n212\n00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.480\nAnd RAM is getting cheaper,\nso that's good too.\n\n213\n00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.510\n>> Yeah, there is no doubt\nthat in today's world and\n\n214\n00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:24.320\nwhat we have today you're gonna see is so\nmuch easier to get the information that\n\n215\n00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.160\nyou need to purchase the right RAM for\nwhatever system that you're building, or\n\n216\n00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.230\nwhatever system you're having\nto upgrade with additional RAM.\n\n217\n00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:36.050\nBut at the A+ level, they expect you to at\nleast know some of the differentiations,\n\n218\n00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.960\neven without actually going, okay,\n\n219\n00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.270\nI just need to type this into some finder\nthat will find me the right piece of RAM.\n\n220\n00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.901\nBut let's go ahead and talk about\nsome of those different ones, and\n\n221\n00:10:43.901 --> 00:10:45.530\nthen we'll show you some of them as well.\n\n222\n00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:49.490\nSo on my diagram here,\nI went ahead and drew out some,\n\n223\n00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.960\ndiagrammed it to try and\nemphasize the differences.\n\n224\n00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.290\nSo when we're actually starting to take a\nlook then at purchasing RAM, we do need to\n\n225\n00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:02.160\nmatch it up to our motherboard, is what\nwe actually need to match it up to.\n\n226\n00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.590\nThe way that it's gonna work, and if you\ntake a look over on the right-hand side,\n\n227\n00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.560\nyou don't see the one at the bottom there,\nbut\n\n228\n00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.540\nyou actually can see the rest of these.\n\n229\n00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:13.475\nLet me see if I can scroll over a little\nbit here so that we can see them.\n\n230\n00:11:13.475 --> 00:11:18.185\nYou actually notice that they all\nlook almost identical, okay, but\n\n231\n00:11:18.185 --> 00:11:23.265\nwhere they differ is in notches that are\nactually on where the pins normally are.\n\n232\n00:11:23.265 --> 00:11:26.545\nSo you'll see, like this top one,\nyou actually see a couple of notches here.\n\n233\n00:11:26.545 --> 00:11:31.075\nOn these other ones the notches\nare actually somewhere along the bottom\n\n234\n00:11:31.075 --> 00:11:34.920\nline here is where you actually see that\nthey're actually in different places.\n\n235\n00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.520\nAnd the reason why that's important\nis because on the motherboard itself,\n\n236\n00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.230\nyou'll see the same thing in those slots.\n\n237\n00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.360\nThose slots will actually have\ndifferent notches in them\n\n238\n00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.920\nthat will then not allow you to actually\nput the wrong memory module in.\n\n239\n00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.630\nAnd the other thing it doesn't allow you\nto do is actually put it in backwards.\n\n240\n00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.520\nIn other words, you can't just flip\nit over and actually make it fit.\n\n241\n00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.740\nBecause of the way that they\nspace these things out,\n\n242\n00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.850\nit actually makes it very difficult.\n\n243\n00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.570\nNow, I'm not gonna say\nthat it can't be done,\n\n244\n00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.640\nbecause I think Daniel actually has had\nsomething like that, where he's actually\n\n245\n00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.580\nseen somebody force something like\nthis in there and break something.\n\n246\n00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.190\n>> Yeah.\nI went to a very well known\n\n247\n00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:13.310\ntechnical college that\nshall remain nameless.\n\n248\n00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:16.210\nAnd one of the guys in our class,\nhe was bound and\n\n249\n00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:20.706\ndetermined to make that, he knew it fit,\ncuz obviously it came out of the system.\n\n250\n00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:24.740\nHe just now had to put it back in, and\nhe was beating on that thing and pounding,\n\n251\n00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.580\nand he pushed it and forced it in.\n\n252\n00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.080\nWell, he had it in backwards,\n\n253\n00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.840\nand when he fired that system up,\nwell, he fired that system up.\n\n254\n00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.930\nIt was literal smoke and smells,\n\n255\n00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.505\nand we were unplugging about as fast as we\ncould so we didn't set the place on fire.\n\n256\n00:12:37.505 --> 00:12:38.880\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n257\n00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.990\nSo when we take a look let's make sure we\nnotice some of the differences here too.\n\n258\n00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.640\nSo what we're taking a look at especially\nis the idea of the terminology\n\n259\n00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.780\nwhen we start taking a look at it.\n\n260\n00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.860\nThe type of RAM that most systems\nuse today is what we call SDRAM.\n\n261\n00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.481\nSometimes you'll hear\npeople call it S-DRAM, but\n\n262\n00:12:55.481 --> 00:12:57.860\nS-D-RAM is technically what it's called.\n\n263\n00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:01.570\nAnd that stands for\nSynchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory.\n\n264\n00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:03.673\n>> What the heck does that mean?\n\n265\n00:13:03.673 --> 00:13:04.730\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, what is that about?\n\n266\n00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.900\nWell, when we take a look\nat the original RAM,\n\n267\n00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.450\nthe original RAM you could\nonly access it so fast.\n\n268\n00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.880\nSo, in other words, on the memory module\nitself, it said this is the fasted speed\n\n269\n00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.960\nthat you can access it and\nthat's pretty much all that matters.\n\n270\n00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.920\nBut as systems started\nactually becoming faster and\n\n271\n00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.660\nfaster, that meant that the bottle\nneck of getting access to the RAM and\n\n272\n00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.500\nbeing able to make it move faster, well,\nthe problem is that the RAM chip itself,\n\n273\n00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.720\nor the RAM module itself,\nwas now the problem.\n\n274\n00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.340\nSo, what they started doing,\nwas called Synchronous RAM instead.\n\n275\n00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.980\nAnd that meant that the RAM itself,\n\n276\n00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:40.290\ncould actually key itself and\nme itself based off the system bus.\n\n277\n00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:44.370\nSo if you had a faster system bus,\nit could actually operate\n\n278\n00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:48.530\nat that faster system bus if it needed to,\nthe clock speed of what it needed to do.\n\n279\n00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:53.470\nSo it's synchronized to the motherboard\nis what we mean by SRAM or SDRAM for\n\n280\n00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.340\nsynchronous dynamic RAM.\n\n281\n00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.080\nAnd the dynamic part just\ntells you it's volatile memory\n\n282\n00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.050\nversus the ROM which would\nbe non-volatile instead.\n\n283\n00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.500\nSo the earliest ones that\nyou might encounter, and\n\n284\n00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.870\nI doubt you will encounter any of these\ntoday, are the early 168 pin RAMs and\n\n285\n00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.340\nyou actually see that they\nare in three separate sections.\n\n286\n00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.686\nNow I did the best that I could\nwhen I found them to try and\n\n287\n00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:15.710\nline up these notches as closely as\nI could to the pictures that we had.\n\n288\n00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:19.340\nAnd you'll see that they're actually\nput in certain places here.\n\n289\n00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.830\nAnd again, all you have to do is make\nsure that if you see one with two\n\n290\n00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.280\nnotches in there, you're not gonna\nfit any of these other ones in there.\n\n291\n00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.140\nNow from that point, right,\nthe synchronous dynamic RAM and\n\n292\n00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.180\nthe way that it worked is kind of simple.\n\n293\n00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.790\nWhen you send data in, right?\n\n294\n00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.950\nIt actually works on what\nwe call different cycles,\n\n295\n00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:37.870\nclock cycles is what it works on.\n\n296\n00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:40.848\nSo when you're accessing a piece of\ninformation, or you're putting stuff in\n\n297\n00:14:40.848 --> 00:14:45.200\nthe RAM, well, normally on the SDRAM you\nactually put one piece of information in,\n\n298\n00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.520\na zero or one, whatever you want\nto call it, on one clock cycle.\n\n299\n00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.150\nSo you actually have a single cycle,\nthat means one piece of information.\n\n300\n00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:57.720\nThe problem that we have then is that\nNATs started actually becoming slow.\n\n301\n00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.630\nSo what they started realizing is that\na lot of times even though motherboards\n\n302\n00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:04.790\nare not actually improving their clock\ncycles, they can do more of it, and\n\n303\n00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:07.080\nthey introduced what they called DDR.\n\n304\n00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:11.510\nDDR stands for double data rate,\nsynchronous dynamic RAM.\n\n305\n00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:14.770\nGo figure, that's a mouthful\nwhen you start seeing that.\n\n306\n00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.780\nAnd that is when they started realizing\nsomething, that they can actually send,\n\n307\n00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:22.340\nwell, two pieces of information\nper clock cycle instead.\n\n308\n00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.210\nNotice we're not actually speeding up the\nmachine, but we're actually saying look,\n\n309\n00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:29.970\nwell we can actually add in more\ninformation on those clock cycles instead,\n\n310\n00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:34.400\nso at the top and at the bottom of that\nclock cycle we can add in even more.\n\n311\n00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.370\nAnd this is where it becomes different,\nright?\n\n312\n00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.640\nAnd we actually see that over\nhere on the right-hand side.\n\n313\n00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.440\nThese are fairly similar, but\n\n314\n00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.820\nnotice right here the notch is\nactually a little bit different.\n\n315\n00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.400\nAnd inside of the motherboards they're\ngonna look fairly the same, but\n\n316\n00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.830\nyou actually will see\na slight difference here too.\n\n317\n00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.920\nAnd then as time started getting faster,\nor\n\n318\n00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.437\ncomputers started getting faster,\nthen DDR2.\n\n319\n00:15:57.437 --> 00:16:02.408\nThese are two actually double DDR, which\nmeant instead of two pieces of information\n\n320\n00:16:02.408 --> 00:16:04.588\nper clock cycle Then it went to four.\n\n321\n00:16:04.588 --> 00:16:07.166\nAnd then DDR3 would be eight pieces.\n\n322\n00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:09.160\nSo it actually works\nin the line of binary.\n\n323\n00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.360\nTwo to the third power,\ntwo to the second power.\n\n324\n00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.046\nAnd two, to itself or to the first power.\n\n325\n00:16:14.046 --> 00:16:17.980\nSo you actually were able to send more\ninformation at any one point in time\n\n326\n00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.800\nwhich doesn't actually increase the linear\nspeed but allows you to actually have more\n\n327\n00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:25.250\ninformation ready to be\nprocessed at any one time.\n\n328\n00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:28.960\nSo notice that these other ones\nup here are 240 pins as well.\n\n329\n00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.546\nAnd we actually see that these actually\ndo have a different, a notch as well,\n\n330\n00:16:32.546 --> 00:16:35.632\nand so it doesn't matter,\nyou turn it one way or turn it the other,\n\n331\n00:16:35.632 --> 00:16:39.120\nthey're still not gonna fit and\nthey're designed to do that.\n\n332\n00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.620\nSo the good thing is,\nthat means only one thing in reality and\n\n333\n00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.770\npracticality, if it fits in the slot,\nit's probably gonna work.\n\n334\n00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.380\nIf it doesn't fit in the slot,\nit's not gonna work.\n\n335\n00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.920\nUnless you jam it in and\nit's still gonna fry.\n\n336\n00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Like what Daniel's situation was.\n\n337\n00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:56.100\nBut seeing that you're probably like okay\nthat's enough but let's go ahead and\n\n338\n00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.130\ntake a look at some RAM\nmodules in reality.\n\n339\n00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:02.760\nWe've actually got a few demos here so\nthat we can show you this as well.\n\n340\n00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.870\nWe brought up our different RAM modules\nthat we can take a look at to try and\n\n341\n00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:09.800\nmake sure that we understand\nwhat we're seeing here too.\n\n342\n00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:13.490\nOver on the right hand side, we actually\nhave two different RAM modules.\n\n343\n00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:17.400\nThese are probably the most current ones\nalong with this one at the bottom as well.\n\n344\n00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.820\nThese over here on the left hand\nside that you'll see on the screen\n\n345\n00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:25.245\nare more of what we call legacy\ntypes of RAM modules as well.\n\n346\n00:17:25.245 --> 00:17:27.365\nSo usually in the realm of RAM, right,\n\n347\n00:17:27.365 --> 00:17:32.825\nwhen we see a stick of RAM like this,\nthe chips on its own circuit board,\n\n348\n00:17:32.825 --> 00:17:36.730\nthis is what we call a memory module,\nis what we end up calling it.\n\n349\n00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.950\nAnd most of the memory modules\nthat we're gonna work with today,\n\n350\n00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.700\nare what we call DIMMs.\n\n351\n00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:41.960\nDual inline memory module.\n\n352\n00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.850\nNow, if you're not sure what that means,\nlet me show you a comparison.\n\n353\n00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:49.850\nOver here on this left hand side is what\nwe call a single inline memory module.\n\n354\n00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.723\nAnd the easiest way to see this is,\nDaniel go and hold this,\n\n355\n00:17:52.723 --> 00:17:55.480\nhold it up vertically a little bit,\nthere you go.\n\n356\n00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.260\nWhen you see this, you actually\nsee a couple of things, right?\n\n357\n00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.590\nOne, you actually see\nRAM chips on this side.\n\n358\n00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:02.465\nBut notice on the backside,\nthere's nothing.\n\n359\n00:18:02.465 --> 00:18:05.120\nIt's just an empty circuit board instead.\n\n360\n00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.410\nAnd so those were on the earlier\ncomputers that we had.\n\n361\n00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:10.670\nActually, there's an older\nDIMM right there, too.\n\n362\n00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:15.100\nBut on the newer ones, though,\nyou'll actually notice that on both sides,\n\n363\n00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.500\nyou'll see chips on this side you'll\nnotice there's eight on this side,\n\n364\n00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.110\nand eight on this side as well.\n\n365\n00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:24.022\nSo you'll actually be able to see\nthose differences when you talk about\n\n366\n00:18:24.022 --> 00:18:26.060\nthe difference between a SIMM and a DIMM.\n\n367\n00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.950\nHopefully you'll never have to\nwork with SIMMs too often but\n\n368\n00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.640\nevery once in a while you\nwill run across them.\n\n369\n00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.890\nSo if you do run across something\nlike that you'll still see that.\n\n370\n00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.770\nNotice that we do see some\nof the notches here too.\n\n371\n00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:40.440\nAn older one that we also\nsee is right here as well.\n\n372\n00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.930\nYou can actually see the difference\neven in the chip sizes.\n\n373\n00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.930\nSo this one's actually off of an older\ncomputer and you can see how big these\n\n374\n00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:50.640\nwere in comparison to the ones\nthat you see up here too.\n\n375\n00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.690\nNow this is an older DIMM module, and\nyou can actually still see the 16 pins\n\n376\n00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:58.150\non each side, or\non both sides if you add them up.\n\n377\n00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.090\nSo what is the big\ndifference between these?\n\n378\n00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:04.810\nWell, this one right here\nis an older DDR module.\n\n379\n00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:09.260\nAnd a lot of times what you actually\ncan look for is right here on this tag.\n\n380\n00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:10.870\nAnd you can't really see that.\n\n381\n00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:14.220\nBut, it actually does tell you\nsome of the specifications for it.\n\n382\n00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.100\nSo, you might've actually heard\nthe way that the RAM's normally\n\n383\n00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.950\ngoing to be described on packaging.\n\n384\n00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:25.455\nYou might hear like a PC number, and\nthat one right here is actually a PC3200.\n\n385\n00:19:25.455 --> 00:19:29.106\nAnd all you have to do is do what I did,\nwhich is you Google it, and\n\n386\n00:19:29.106 --> 00:19:32.295\nyou find out PC3200, that's a DDR module.\n\n387\n00:19:32.295 --> 00:19:33.555\nThat's what you see.\n\n388\n00:19:33.555 --> 00:19:37.785\nAll these other ones here are 4200s,\nand that one's a 6400.\n\n389\n00:19:37.785 --> 00:19:43.435\nThis is actually a higher number, and\nthese are actually DVR2 modules instead.\n\n390\n00:19:43.435 --> 00:19:46.005\nSo if we were to kind of take these and\nstack them up,\n\n391\n00:19:46.005 --> 00:19:48.660\nI don't know if we can see that or\nnot very easily.\n\n392\n00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.660\nYou'll notice that the slot\nactually did line directly up.\n\n393\n00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.880\nAnd that's how I know\nthey're actually a DDR2.\n\n394\n00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.771\nOne of them will actually have\nmore pins than the other one and\n\n395\n00:19:58.771 --> 00:20:02.910\na lot of times too,\nif it's actually just a regular 184 pin.\n\n396\n00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.824\nAnd when we talk about the pin numbers,\n\n397\n00:20:04.824 --> 00:20:07.682\nwe look at these little gold\nstripes that we see down here.\n\n398\n00:20:07.682 --> 00:20:08.980\nOriginal SIMM,\n\n399\n00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:14.048\neven though it has traces on this side\nit goes to none of the modules up here.\n\n400\n00:20:14.048 --> 00:20:16.700\nOn these DIMMs, these actually\nallow it to access one side,\n\n401\n00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.390\nand allow it to also access\nthe other one as well.\n\n402\n00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:24.450\nNow, so this module right here is\nprobably the one that you will not see\n\n403\n00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.110\ntoo often in most computers.\n\n404\n00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:29.070\nBut these are still\nprobably viable out there.\n\n405\n00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.720\nThe SIMM not so much anymore,\nbut this one is still viable.\n\n406\n00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.380\nNow, ones on faster systems\nsuch as gaming computers,\n\n407\n00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.660\nlet me get that out of the glare here a\nlittle bit, you'll normally also see this.\n\n408\n00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.530\nDaniel what is this red thing right here?\n\n409\n00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.900\nI see a memory module but\nwhat's that red thing for?\n\n410\n00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.940\n>> Yeah the red thing\nis to dissipate heat.\n\n411\n00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:51.060\nObviously a memory module has a bunch\nof little switches inside of them that\n\n412\n00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:51.740\nturn off and on,\n\n413\n00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.540\nif you look down at the at the microscopic\nlevel you'd see that happening.\n\n414\n00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.530\nWell, movement generates heat and\n\n415\n00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:01.480\nwhen you've got as many switches\ninside of a chip as these do,\n\n416\n00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.670\nthese generate a lot of heat so\nthey need to dissipate that heat out.\n\n417\n00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:07.390\nThat's a pretty hard core\npiece of RAM right there.\n\n418\n00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.450\nSo it needed its own heat sink\nwhich is basically what it is,\n\n419\n00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:14.890\njust a piece of aluminum that attaches,\nmakes contact to those chips so\n\n420\n00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:18.690\nthat it can radiate the heat out to that\nand let that aluminum dissipate the heat.\n\n421\n00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.587\nCuz aluminum does a really\ngood job of dissipating heat.\n\n422\n00:21:21.587 --> 00:21:22.457\nSo that's what it is.\n\n423\n00:21:22.457 --> 00:21:26.640\n>> Yeah, it's kind of interesting that now\nwhat we're starting to see is that the RAM\n\n424\n00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.273\nmodules themselves,\nthey're actually getting so\n\n425\n00:21:29.273 --> 00:21:31.980\nbig in terms of the capacity\nthat they have.\n\n426\n00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.750\nAnd, also, that we're sending so\nmuch information to them,\n\n427\n00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.520\nthat they're generating enough heat, where\nthey essentially have their own heat sink,\n\n428\n00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.540\non the actual individual\nmemory models themselves.\n\n429\n00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:45.030\nNotice that these things don't have it,\nand they're depending on the case cooling\n\n430\n00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.990\nto actually provide\nthe cooling that they need.\n\n431\n00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.920\nThis is saying we need a little bit more\nhelp because of how fast we're actually\n\n432\n00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.250\nsending information.\n\n433\n00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:55.020\nThis last one down here is an example\nof what we call a SO-DIMM,\n\n434\n00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.940\nsmall outline dual in-line memory module.\n\n435\n00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:04.130\nNow this is actually exactly half of\nthe size of one of these modules up here.\n\n436\n00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:09.240\nSo that's exactly what a SO-DIMM\nmeasures in the actual measurement.\n\n437\n00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.629\nNormally what we tend to see, these\nsystems are on smaller motherboard form\n\n438\n00:22:13.629 --> 00:22:15.970\nfactors, like the ITX and the Mini ITX.\n\n439\n00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.230\nWe also tend to see them\ninside of laptops as well.\n\n440\n00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:22.560\nSo when you do see something like that,\nthat's what you'll also end up seeing.\n\n441\n00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.830\nBut most recently, like even on my laptop,\nwe're starting to see something a little\n\n442\n00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.510\nbit newer too,\nwhich is you can't replace anything.\n\n443\n00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:31.650\nThey're now soldering them\nback onto the motherboard.\n\n444\n00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:32.870\nAnd it's actually very difficult to\n\n445\n00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:34.630\nupgrade some of these\ndifferent modules as well.\n\n446\n00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.460\nBut, being able to understand\nthat you will see differences.\n\n447\n00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.800\nThe key here, right,\nis that you're actually replacing it for\n\n448\n00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.820\na system of some sort.\n\n449\n00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:46.300\nRegardless of which one it is,\nmake sure you get the right one for\n\n450\n00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.770\nyour computer system.\n\n451\n00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.180\n>> And what that normally means for\n\n452\n00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:53.020\nus, if I'm adding an additional RAM\nis that I want to make sure that it's\n\n453\n00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:56.950\nactually the same size of RAM on all\nthe additional sticks that I have.\n\n454\n00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:00.680\nOr if I'm actually replacing it with more\nRAM, make sure I get the same modules for\n\n455\n00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.060\nall of those as well.\n\n456\n00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.330\nCuz that's actually going to be important.\n\n457\n00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:08.950\nCan you mix and match if you have a 512\nmegabyte stick and a gigabyte stick?\n\n458\n00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.530\nSure, you can do that.\n\n459\n00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:12.800\nBut we're gonna actually take a look\nat something probably in just\n\n460\n00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.510\nanother segment here.\n\n461\n00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:16.390\nLooks like we're gonna end up\ndoing a part two on this thing.\n\n462\n00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.490\nWe're gonna actually end up taking\na look that you can do it, but\n\n463\n00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:22.850\nthere's other features that actually\nmake the RAM perform better, and\n\n464\n00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:26.390\nmake it actually perform so well,\nthat you wanna take advantage of those.\n\n465\n00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:31.630\nAnd those require of course, duplicate or\nidentical types of memory modules, too.\n\n466\n00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:35.058\nSo we'll end up seeing that\nwhen we start to take a look.\n\n467\n00:23:35.058 --> 00:23:38.120\nSo, when we start doing something like\nthat, when we actually start picking out\n\n468\n00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:42.740\nRAM, you actually have to pick those\ncapacities that you need, okay.\n\n469\n00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:48.318\nAnd also, you actually, it has to be\nable to work with that motherboard.\n\n470\n00:23:48.318 --> 00:23:52.743\nSome motherboards you'll see where it\nactually says limited to, let's say, 32\n\n471\n00:23:52.743 --> 00:23:56.753\ngigs of RAM of 16 gigs of RAM or whatever\nit might be and you go I don't care.\n\n472\n00:23:56.753 --> 00:23:58.168\nI'm gonna put 64 gigs in there.\n\n473\n00:23:58.168 --> 00:23:59.840\nWell, that motherboard's limited.\n\n474\n00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.162\nYou have to be very careful with that too.\n\n475\n00:24:02.162 --> 00:24:05.599\nRemember that sometimes when you actually\ndo end up purchasing a motherboard,\n\n476\n00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:09.086\nwhat's gonna end up happening, if you\ndon't just go out and buy whatever RAM you\n\n477\n00:24:09.086 --> 00:24:12.900\nwant to, you have to make sure that you\nget the right one for that motherboard.\n\n478\n00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.890\nAs I put up here,\nsome motherboards are incredibly picky.\n\n479\n00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:20.170\nYou may find out that the way\nthat use that motherboard,\n\n480\n00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:25.000\nsome of them may not want you to actually\nuse well, different size memory models.\n\n481\n00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.780\nAnd, you'll take a look at the\ndocumentation that says, you can do it but\n\n482\n00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.935\nwe don't recommend you\nactually being out and do it.\n\n483\n00:24:29.935 --> 00:24:33.035\nYou actually end up seeing that some of\nthem may require you to install them in\n\n484\n00:24:33.035 --> 00:24:35.845\npairs instead of working\nwith a single one as well.\n\n485\n00:24:35.845 --> 00:24:38.303\nYou may also actually take advantages\nof things that we'll call dual and\n\n486\n00:24:38.303 --> 00:24:39.295\ntriple channel.\n\n487\n00:24:39.295 --> 00:24:40.965\nWe'll take a look at\nthat in another episode.\n\n488\n00:24:40.965 --> 00:24:45.490\nThen, note where the maximum amount\nof memory actually is going to be.\n\n489\n00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:47.485\nNow, most systems will kinda\ngive you a little bit of leeway.\n\n490\n00:24:47.485 --> 00:24:50.710\nIn other words they'll say,\nhere's the maximum that's supported.\n\n491\n00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:54.620\nBut you might actually find out that you\ncan install more and additional memory and\n\n492\n00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.780\nit may recognize it but\nthat's not always a guarantee.\n\n493\n00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.070\nSo don't try and\n\n494\n00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:04.810\ngo beyond the maximum if you're using this\nin a mission critical type of system.\n\n495\n00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:05.700\nA server of sorts.\n\n496\n00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.020\nIf you're doing that on your home system,\ngo ahead.\n\n497\n00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:11.350\nIf you have the extra money,\nblow it out and see what happens there.\n\n498\n00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:12.920\nYou'll probably be fine.\n\n499\n00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.560\nBut, when you start\nseeing stuff like that,\n\n500\n00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.680\nthat's what you have to pay attention to.\n\n501\n00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.410\nSo we also wanna show you an example\n\n502\n00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:23.110\nof what we're talking about\nhere on a real board instead.\n\n503\n00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:27.390\nAs we switch back over to our motherboard,\nwe've got a motherboard set up.\n\n504\n00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:30.140\nAnd you actually notice these\ndifferent RAM modules that are all, or\n\n505\n00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.400\nthese RAM slots on this\nmotherboard that are also setup.\n\n506\n00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:37.370\nNow, remember that we actually did have\nsome of the different RAM modules that we\n\n507\n00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:39.080\ncould put in there, but\n\n508\n00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.290\nall of these are actually not going\nto fit exactly the way they want to.\n\n509\n00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:46.980\nAnd you'll see that they can rock back and\nforth and so these are not what you want.\n\n510\n00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.460\nYou need to make sure that when you\ntake a look at your motherboard\n\n511\n00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.490\nthat you get the right type of RAM.\n\n512\n00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:54.440\nThis one, I know,\nis specifically for that DDR3.\n\n513\n00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.850\nAnd what we have to take a look at is\nthe way we actually put them in, and\n\n514\n00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:59.940\nmake sure that we can get them seated in.\n\n515\n00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:04.460\nThis particular motherboard itself\nis actually a little bit unusual and\n\n516\n00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:09.600\nthat it has one black slot and these\nthree blue slots that are right here.\n\n517\n00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.770\nIf you are installing this for\n\n518\n00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.470\nthe first time,\nyou need to pay attention to these slots.\n\n519\n00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.370\nSometimes you'll see\nthat they're color-coded.\n\n520\n00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:16.900\nSometimes you see that they aren't.\n\n521\n00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:20.880\nBut pay attention what they're asking you\nto do when you do something like this.\n\n522\n00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.350\nIf you only have one memory module,\n\n523\n00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:26.290\nit may actually be important that you\nknow exactly which one to put it in.\n\n524\n00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:30.120\nAnd you'll notice a lot of time that\nthese slots are gonna be numbered.\n\n525\n00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.010\nUsually zero through whatever or\n\n526\n00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:35.100\none through whatever it's gonna be and\nthat one's normally gonna tell you,\n\n527\n00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.340\nhere's the first one that they\nwould like you to put something in.\n\n528\n00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:42.380\nIf they expect pairs, a lot of times,\nyou'll actually see that they may\n\n529\n00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.140\ncolor code them to where two of them\nwill be blue, two of them will be black,\n\n530\n00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.200\nor whatever color it might to be.\n\n531\n00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.030\nBut on this one,\n\n532\n00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:51.570\nthis particular motherboard, supports\nsomething that we call a triple channel.\n\n533\n00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:55.540\nWe'll take a look at that,\nlike I said, in another episode too.\n\n534\n00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.200\nBut right away,\nwhen you see a board like this,\n\n535\n00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.220\nyou go and\nfind the product specifications.\n\n536\n00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.290\nAnd on this one Daniel,\n\n537\n00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:04.030\nif you were to actually take that memory\nmodule right here, that we have on\n\n538\n00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:07.540\nthe screen, and we were to put it in,\nthe thing that we have to look out for\n\n539\n00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:11.010\nDaniel is right there, that notch,\nmake sure we line that up right?\n\n540\n00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:14.840\n>> Yeah, you want to make sure you get\nthe notch lined up correctly, again it can\n\n541\n00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.430\nlook like it's going in the right way,\nand if you're pushing it, it does take\n\n542\n00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:21.910\na little bit of juice to push these\nguys down and seat them in correctly.\n\n543\n00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:22.710\nDon't get me wrong,\n\n544\n00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.260\nit takes a little bit of power,\ndon't be afraid to put some umph on it.\n\n545\n00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:30.410\nBut, if you're not getting somewhere,\nor if one side's clicking in, the other\n\n546\n00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:33.670\nside's not clicking in, that's a good\nindication that you have it in backwards.\n\n547\n00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:37.260\nJust try flipping it around,\nmaybe verify, look where that notch is.\n\n548\n00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.070\nMake sure that it's lined up with\nthe notch that's actually in the slot.\n\n549\n00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:43.880\nAnd if everything looks good,\nthen go ahead and put some stank on it.\n\n550\n00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.240\nGo ahead and shove her on down in the\nboard, and it should click on both sides.\n\n551\n00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:52.640\nThose little tabs will pull in and help\nkeep it seated and not let it rock out.\n\n552\n00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.550\n>> So, what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna install this one.\n\n553\n00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:57.410\nIf you do see a board like this\nwhere you actually only have one,\n\n554\n00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:59.720\nwell that represents\na single channel memory.\n\n555\n00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.070\nIf that is the only module that I have,\n\n556\n00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.000\nit's the one that I'm probably gonna\nend up putting it in right here.\n\n557\n00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.250\nIs this one.\nAnd,\n\n558\n00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:08.990\nwe'll make sure that it actually lines up.\n\n559\n00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:11.590\nAnd, you'll actually notice\nthat you have these two tabs.\n\n560\n00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:15.660\nAnd usually all you have to do is put\na little force down on one side and\n\n561\n00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:19.530\nthen on the other and that snaps it\nright in there and locks it in place.\n\n562\n00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:22.120\nIf you needed to remove one,\nyou just simply go ahead and\n\n563\n00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.770\npull on one side and\nget your finger ont he other side.\n\n564\n00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:29.020\nAnd that normally allows it\nto eject it a little bit.\n\n565\n00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.650\nAnd it comes right out.\n\n566\n00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:34.910\nSo being able to understand where to put\nthe memory modules when you see this.\n\n567\n00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:38.360\nNow, you know that you're gonna\nbe using multiple memory modules,\n\n568\n00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:40.950\nyou might actually go ahead and see,\nlike on this one, they recommend if you're\n\n569\n00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:44.350\nusing multiple, make sure you start\nwith the first blue slot instead.\n\n570\n00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:47.010\nYou got a single one,\nstart with this black one instead.\n\n571\n00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:51.080\nSo, there are gonna be differentiations\ndepending on your configuration.\n\n572\n00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.340\nPay attention to that, get the product\nguide for the mother board itself,\n\n573\n00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.960\nmake sure you understand what's going on\nif you're replacing these things too.\n\n574\n00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.540\nSo there's a lot of material to actually\nlearn just about a little bit of RAM here.\n\n575\n00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.030\n>> Yeah,\nyou took the words right out of my mouth.\n\n576\n00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:06.870\nSo much information about RAM we're going\nto need to do a part two on this so\n\n577\n00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:09.020\nhopefully you'll check\nthat episode out as well.\n\n578\n00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:11.670\nBut as for this one,\nlooks like we're wrapping it up.\n\n579\n00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:13.430\n>> So signing off for ITProTV.\n\n580\n00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:14.750\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n581\n00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:17.050\n>> And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n582\n00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:18.180\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n583\n00:29:18.180 -->

00:00:08.385\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.385 --> 00:00:12.183\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.183 --> 00:00:14.118\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n6\n00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:16.641\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:18.844\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\n\n8\n00:00:18.844 --> 00:00:22.977\nin today's episode we're coming\nback with more on our CSAA series.\n\n9\n00:00:22.977 --> 00:00:26.277\nAnd of course, joining us in the studio,\nour mentor in that endeavor,\n\n10\n00:00:26.277 --> 00:00:27.890\nour good friend, Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n11\n00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.839\nDon, welcome back sir.\n\n12\n00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:30.420\nSo glad to have you, how's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.370\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing just well, Daniel.\n\n14\n00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.490\nReady to dive right back into\nthe world of AWS, and like you said,\n\n15\n00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.290\njumping right back into that Certified\nSolutions Architect Associate exam.\n\n16\n00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.388\nAnd we're gonna kick this one off\ntalking about networking because well,\n\n17\n00:00:42.388 --> 00:00:45.001\nwhen you got a cloud service,\nhow you get to it?\n\n18\n00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:46.267\nYou got to use a network, so\n\n19\n00:00:46.267 --> 00:00:49.861\nit's kind of a one component you have to\nhave when you deploy a cloud service.\n\n20\n00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:53.349\nAnd fortunately we've got a lot of\nfunctionality there from Amazon.\n\n21\n00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:57.338\nBut as I've said before, with great\nfunctionality comes great documentation or\n\n22\n00:00:57.338 --> 00:00:58.739\nsomething, I don't know.\n\n23\n00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.018\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's a lot of work,\n\n24\n00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:01.129\nit's a lot of step to figure out.\n\n25\n00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.068\nA lot of different moving parts,\nthey go together to form that network.\n\n26\n00:01:04.068 --> 00:01:06.025\nSo we're going to take a look at\nthat right here in this episode.\n\n27\n00:01:06.025 --> 00:01:10.640\nAnd kind of figure out what we need to\nknow to get a virtual private cloud or\n\n28\n00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.300\na VPC, configured.\n\n29\n00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.275\n&gt;&gt; Well Don,\nwhere do we start when it comes to VPCs?\n\n30\n00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:15.299\nWhat are some of the basics?\n\n31\n00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.656\n&gt;&gt; All right, lets start off with\nwhat the heck a VPC is, right?\n\n32\n00:01:17.656 --> 00:01:19.480\nSo a virtual private cloud.\n\n33\n00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.768\nWhen we go with Amazon Web Services,\nthey're a cloud provider, right?\n\n34\n00:01:23.768 --> 00:01:27.710\nWe're buying platforms that are deployed\ninside of a cloud environment.\n\n35\n00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.583\nAnd I've said before a cloud is\nreally just a marketing term,\n\n36\n00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:33.577\nit means that it's computers,\nthere you go, that's a cloud.\n\n37\n00:01:33.577 --> 00:01:36.692\nSo what makes it\na virtually private cloud?\n\n38\n00:01:36.692 --> 00:01:41.685\nWell by default, when you deploy\nan EC2 instance or an S3 bucket or\n\n39\n00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:47.045\nsomething like that, then you throw\nit in to the AWS environment.\n\n40\n00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:50.187\nIt's expecting you to be sharing\nresources with the Internet.\n\n41\n00:01:50.187 --> 00:01:52.585\nSo you can open up ports\nin the security group.\n\n42\n00:01:52.585 --> 00:01:55.455\nYou can create an S3 bucket and\nset everyone permissions on it.\n\n43\n00:01:55.455 --> 00:01:59.435\nAnd now the whole world has access,\nmaybe that's what you want.\n\n44\n00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:02.117\nYou're setting up a web server,\nyou want the world to get to your website,\n\n45\n00:02:02.117 --> 00:02:02.806\nthat makes sense.\n\n46\n00:02:02.806 --> 00:02:04.800\nAnd for a lot of people,\nthat's the way to go.\n\n47\n00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.630\nBut what if I have resources I\nwanna stick up in the cloud but\n\n48\n00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.010\nI don't want the world to get to them?\n\n49\n00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.313\nMaybe I have a database server that I want\nmy web front ends to be able to access.\n\n50\n00:02:15.313 --> 00:02:18.337\nI don't want the world to be able to\naccess, just the web front ends or\n\n51\n00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:20.021\nmaybe it's not even about the world.\n\n52\n00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:23.894\nMaybe I just have my own database servers\nor file servers and I wanna put them in\n\n53\n00:02:23.894 --> 00:02:27.189\nthe cloud for me to use, for\nmy company or me, personally to use.\n\n54\n00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:28.890\nAnd I don't want the world to get at them.\n\n55\n00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.360\nWell the public nature of a cloud service\ndoes not kinda play well with that.\n\n56\n00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.875\nAnd so where's a virtual,\nprivate cloud or a VPC comes in.\n\n57\n00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:41.558\nIs that your able to kind of\ndivide up this public cloud and\n\n58\n00:02:41.558 --> 00:02:44.105\ncreate little private portions of it.\n\n59\n00:02:44.105 --> 00:02:47.078\nPrivate portions that only\nyou have access to and or,\n\n60\n00:02:47.078 --> 00:02:51.190\nI should phrase that differently,\nthat you control, who has access to.\n\n61\n00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.400\nBy default, it will only be you, but\n\n62\n00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.850\nyou can always open that up to\ngive other people access too.\n\n63\n00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.190\n&gt;&gt; Don, this sounds a lot like VLANs\ninstead of a traditional network.\n\n64\n00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's similar to VLANs,\nexcept when we configure a VLAN,\n\n65\n00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.170\nwhat do we have to do?\n\n66\n00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.330\nWe have to log into a switch we have\nto assign ports to different vlans and\n\n67\n00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.670\nkind of isolate things out.\n\n68\n00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.625\nWell with a VPC, when you're in Amazon,\ndo you see switches?\n\n69\n00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:14.730\nDo you even know what\nvendor the switches are?\n\n70\n00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.165\nNo, we don't see them, we don't touch\nthem, we're completely isolated from them.\n\n71\n00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:24.540\nSo what we have instead of a vlan\nis a virtual private cloud, a VPC.\n\n72\n00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.816\nAnd we can get in there and configure it.\n\n73\n00:03:25.816 --> 00:03:28.289\nAnd it's made up of a number\nof different components, but\n\n74\n00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:30.673\nits all built very similar to\nwhat we'd see with a VLAN.\n\n75\n00:03:30.673 --> 00:03:34.976\nAnd I've got a little diagram here that\nkinda demonstrates that when you build\n\n76\n00:03:34.976 --> 00:03:35.505\nup a VPC.\n\n77\n00:03:35.505 --> 00:03:40.100\nIt's made up of several different pieces\nand we're gonna talk about each of these\n\n78\n00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.400\npieces as we go, but\nthe most important piece is a subnet.\n\n79\n00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.205\nWhen you create a virtual private cloud\nyou will pick a primary network for it.\n\n80\n00:03:48.205 --> 00:03:52.621\nSo in this diagram for\nexample it's 10.0.0.0/16, all right?\n\n81\n00:03:52.621 --> 00:03:58.146\nThat's a class b network\nthat has 65,534 usable IPs.\n\n82\n00:03:58.146 --> 00:04:00.420\nYes, I memorized that\nnumber before the show.\n\n83\n00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.132\nSo it gives us a ton of IP addresses,\na ton of hosts or EC2 instances or\n\n84\n00:04:04.132 --> 00:04:08.486\nload balancer, or whatever it is that we\nwant to have available on that network.\n\n85\n00:04:08.486 --> 00:04:11.500\n65,000, that's a lot, right?\n\n86\n00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.340\nBut we don't want to put all of\nour eggs in one basket do we?\n\n87\n00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.720\nSo what we do is we take that subnet and\nthen we divide it up, and\n\n88\n00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.388\nwe spread that out across\navailabilities zone.\n\n89\n00:04:21.388 --> 00:04:24.078\nSo see, I've got availability zone a,\navailability zone B, and\n\n90\n00:04:24.078 --> 00:04:26.430\nwe've got these smaller\nnetworks inside of it.\n\n91\n00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.778\nThat's us breaking the network apart.\n\n92\n00:04:28.778 --> 00:04:35.317\nNotice that I've got 10.0.0.0 again here,\nbut it's a /24, instead of a /16.\n\n93\n00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:41.855\n/16 is 65,000 IPs, /24,\n254 usable IPs, much, much smaller.\n\n94\n00:04:41.855 --> 00:04:47.519\nAnd then 10.0.1.0/24,\nanother 254 usable IPs.\n\n95\n00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:52.298\nSo right there is basically 500\nout of the 65,000 IPs I have.\n\n96\n00:04:52.298 --> 00:04:56.345\nBut I'm spreading them across availability\nzones, that way I get redundancy,\n\n97\n00:04:56.345 --> 00:04:58.677\nthat way I get load balancing,\nreliability.\n\n98\n00:04:58.677 --> 00:05:03.750\nI get all those big benefits,\nmeanwhile it's still a private cloud.\n\n99\n00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.487\nI can put my instances in there and\nthey can communicate and\n\n100\n00:05:07.487 --> 00:05:12.650\ntalk and I can control exactly who has\naccess to them, based on the system.\n\n101\n00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.281\nSo when I go to set up a VPC,\n\n102\n00:05:14.281 --> 00:05:19.054\none of the first decisions I've to make\nis the subnet that I'm going to use.\n\n103\n00:05:19.054 --> 00:05:22.137\nAnd it can be as big as a /16 like this,\nright?\n\n104\n00:05:22.137 --> 00:05:24.479\nYou can't go bigger you\ncan't go to a /15 or 14.\n\n105\n00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:29.017\nRemember networks get bigger\nthe smaller their subnet identifiers.\n\n106\n00:05:29.017 --> 00:05:34.638\nSo this is the biggest I can go,\nthe smallest I can go is a /28.\n\n107\n00:05:34.638 --> 00:05:37.787\nIf you do a /28,\nyou get 14 usable IP addresses, so\n\n108\n00:05:37.787 --> 00:05:40.230\nthat's the smallest you can go.\n\n109\n00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.323\nBut you'll notice,\nthese are all private IPs anyway, right?\n\n110\n00:05:43.323 --> 00:05:49.170\nSo 10.0.0, that's an RFC 1918 private\nIP address, it's not Internet routable.\n\n111\n00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.259\nSo if it's not internet routable anyway,\nyou might as well use bigger spaces to\n\n112\n00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:57.056\ngive you the growing room to be able\nto stretch out and fill all your space.\n\n113\n00:05:57.056 --> 00:05:58.868\nSo that's what they're doing\nhere in the example and\n\n114\n00:05:58.868 --> 00:06:02.010\nthat's kind of what we'll normally see\nwhen we're designing in the real world.\n\n115\n00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.637\nBetter to go big on these than to go\nsmall and run out of IPs later on.\n\n116\n00:06:05.637 --> 00:06:10.480\nIt's actually very difficult to change\nthe IPs cuz it's not really very doable.\n\n117\n00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.012\nYou end up having to reissue a lot\nof things, reconfigure machines,\n\n118\n00:06:13.012 --> 00:06:14.430\nit becomes a nightmare.\n\n119\n00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.130\nBetter to leave growing\nroom in the beginning.\n\n120\n00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.450\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, that being said, if we were\ndisconnecting them ultimately we do want\n\n121\n00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.250\nthese smaller networks to be able to talk\nto each other how do we make that happen?\n\n122\n00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.840\n&gt;&gt; In my diagram,\n\n123\n00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.230\nyou'll notice this thing sitting over\nhere to the side, the main routing table.\n\n124\n00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.227\nWhen you configure a VPC, there's a couple\nof different things that happen, right?\n\n125\n00:06:33.227 --> 00:06:36.770\nAnd I guess let me clarify this for those\nof you who are doing it in the real world.\n\n126\n00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.593\nWhen you set up an AWS account,\nyou will have one VPC.\n\n127\n00:06:41.593 --> 00:06:42.770\nWell shoot, there's an exception.\n\n128\n00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.601\nThere is a time where you might not.\n\n129\n00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:46.050\nLet's go for the history here, okay?\n\n130\n00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.600\nVPCs weren't always around.\n\n131\n00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.020\nWhen I got started with EC2 and just\nAWS in general, VPCs didn't exist yet.\n\n132\n00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.250\nYou just had the public cloud\nthat was a part of AWS.\n\n133\n00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.619\nAnd so when we spun up our machines,\nthey were all on this public cloud and\n\n134\n00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:03.065\nthat was all that you could do.\n\n135\n00:07:03.065 --> 00:07:10.230\nWell VPCs were introduced in 2012,\n2013 when they finally went mainstream.\n\n136\n00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.148\nAnd ever since then\neverybody now has VPCs.\n\n137\n00:07:13.148 --> 00:07:15.711\nIn fact,\nif you set up a new account today,\n\n138\n00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:19.571\nreally if you've set up an account\nsince December of 2013.\n\n139\n00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:23.315\nSo 2014, and more recent,\nyou only have support of VPC,\n\n140\n00:07:23.315 --> 00:07:25.880\nyou can't even do it the old way.\n\n141\n00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.796\nBut it's older accounts like mine where\nI still have the EC2 plastic model,\n\n142\n00:07:29.796 --> 00:07:32.099\nwhere I can deploy\nan instance not into a VPC.\n\n143\n00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:37.030\nBut just into the regular EC2-Classic\nCloud, and you really don't wanna do that.\n\n144\n00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.995\nThat's just there because some people\nstill have systems that are tied to it.\n\n145\n00:07:39.995 --> 00:07:42.801\nBut it's been years at this point,\nit's 2017.\n\n146\n00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:46.018\nSo for four years now,\nevery new account only has access to VPCs,\n\n147\n00:07:46.018 --> 00:07:47.725\nthat's what we want, all right?\n\n148\n00:07:47.725 --> 00:07:48.966\nSo there's one variation.\n\n149\n00:07:48.966 --> 00:07:53.329\nMost accounts will only have support for\nVPCs and not ES2-Classic.\n\n150\n00:07:53.329 --> 00:07:57.838\nThe second variation is, when you deploy\na new account, one VPC is created for\n\n151\n00:07:57.838 --> 00:07:59.730\nyou automatically.\n\n152\n00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:01.884\nAnd that's your default VPC.\n\n153\n00:08:01.884 --> 00:08:05.138\nAnd every machine you stick in\nthere is gonna have some certain\n\n154\n00:08:05.138 --> 00:08:06.850\ncharacteristics to it.\n\n155\n00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.100\nThe default VPC actually behaves\nvery much like EC2 classic,\n\n156\n00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.840\nthat's why we don't need it anymore.\n\n157\n00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.160\nThat it has a routing table by default,\nand it has an Internet gateway,\n\n158\n00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.500\nso you can get out and\nbrowse the Internet.\n\n159\n00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.510\nYou can do all that stuff\nin the default VPC.\n\n160\n00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.260\nBut when you create your own VPC,\nif you add a new one,\n\n161\n00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.690\nyou have to provide a subnet, but\nyou don't have to provide a router or\n\n162\n00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.260\na way to get out the Internet,\nor anything like that.\n\n163\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.110\nSo it's missing a lot of pieces,\nand you add in what you want.\n\n164\n00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.830\nIt sounds bad, but it's a good thing.\n\n165\n00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.160\nIt gives you the control.\n\n166\n00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.910\nYou can say,\nI need this VPC to be truly isolated,\n\n167\n00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:41.760\nI don't want it to get to the Internet.\n\n168\n00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.090\nOr, yeah, I want this one to get to\nthe Internet so let me add the router in.\n\n169\n00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.910\nSo this main routing table,\nwhen you create a VPC,\n\n170\n00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.590\nif it's your default one\nit's already got one.\n\n171\n00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.250\nIf you create a custom VPC you'll have\nto make it and the main routing table is\n\n172\n00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.370\nthe one that's gonna be used by all of\nthe subnets that are inside of your VPC.\n\n173\n00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.080\nAnd that'll let them\nroute between each other.\n\n174\n00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.530\nIf I want one of my subnets to\ntalk to one of my other subnets,\n\n175\n00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.190\nthen gotta go through a router to do it.\n\n176\n00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:07.780\nAnd so, it's a virtual router.\n\n177\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.120\nThat virtual router is highly\navailable and horizontally scalable,\n\n178\n00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.580\nwhich means Amazon manages it.\n\n179\n00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.800\nI don't have to touch it,\nI don't have to know about it.\n\n180\n00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.234\nI just go into the web UI or use the\ncommand line utilities and add the routes.\n\n181\n00:09:20.234 --> 00:09:24.855\nSo here they're got a single routing\nhere saying 10.0.0.0/16 is local, and\n\n182\n00:09:24.855 --> 00:09:29.220\nthat's going to allow each of these\nsubnets over here to talk to each other.\n\n183\n00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.790\nJust by passing right through the router\ncuz those are local network networks and\n\n184\n00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.820\nthey can communicate.\n\n185\n00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:38.154\nHaving that router is important if you\nneed communication between the subnets.\n\n186\n00:09:38.154 --> 00:09:41.731\nNow, we don't always need that\ncommunication so you might choose to leave\n\n187\n00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:44.708\nit off but it's easy enough to\nget that set up and put in there.\n\n188\n00:09:44.708 --> 00:09:48.641\nNow once we have the routing table in\nplace, any time we add new subnets into\n\n189\n00:09:48.641 --> 00:09:52.590\nthe VPC they'll take advantage of that or\nyou can add more routing tables.\n\n190\n00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:56.937\nYou can have additional routing tables,\nso might have specific needs for\n\n191\n00:09:56.937 --> 00:09:58.277\nspecific instances.\n\n192\n00:09:58.277 --> 00:10:02.168\nNow, one thing the router doesn't do\nby default is it doesn't connect you\n\n193\n00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:03.750\nto the Internet.\n\n194\n00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.090\nIf you look at this one the main routing\ntable is saying 10.0.0.0/16 is local,\n\n195\n00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.290\nthere's no connection to the Internet.\n\n196\n00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.440\nIf you want to connect to the internet\nalso, you need to set up an IGW,\n\n197\n00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.310\nan Internet gateway.\n\n198\n00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.975\nAn Internet gateway is really just\nan extension of that router that then\n\n199\n00:10:19.975 --> 00:10:21.441\nconnects to the internet and\n\n200\n00:10:21.441 --> 00:10:24.390\nallows you to pass right on\nthrough that to the internet.\n\n201\n00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.124\nThe Internet gateway can function\nin a few different ways but\n\n202\n00:10:27.124 --> 00:10:30.662\nnormally it's just an extension of the\nrouter and you can add a default route to\n\n203\n00:10:30.662 --> 00:10:33.462\nyour main routing table that\npoints to the internet gateway.\n\n204\n00:10:33.462 --> 00:10:36.020\nIf you don't want your VPC connected to\nthe Internet, you just don't add an IGW.\n\n205\n00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.870\nSo it's kind of up to you\nhow you wanna do that.\n\n206\n00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:42.710\nAnd when you create a VPC,\nyou'll see a lot of this in the wizard.\n\n207\n00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:50.010\nSo if I go into EC2, and pull up my\nVPC's in here, actually, hang on.\n\n208\n00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.890\nI get kinda stuck in the old ways\nsometimes The VPCs because it all used to\n\n209\n00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.860\nbe part of EC2 classic.I kind\nof have a habit of going there.\n\n210\n00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.100\nBut VPCs are now their own separate entity\nso if I come down here to network and\n\n211\n00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.030\ndelivery I find my VPCs.\n\n212\n00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:06.358\nAnd if i go to create a new VPC you will\nfind where it asks me a lot of this stuff.\n\n213\n00:11:06.358 --> 00:11:10.837\nSo if I start a VPC wizard and\nwalk through it, it's gonna ask me,\n\n214\n00:11:10.837 --> 00:11:13.390\ndo I want a single public subnet?\n\n215\n00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.396\nDo I want a public and private subnet?\n\n216\n00:11:16.396 --> 00:11:19.260\nDo I want with them with\nhardware VPN access?\n\n217\n00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.560\nI'm picking and\nchoosing the types of network that I want.\n\n218\n00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.710\nAnd as we walk through the wizard, it's\ngoing to ask me about whether I want to\n\n219\n00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.220\nhave an internet gateway, and\nwhether I want those services?\n\n220\n00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.690\nSo, it's nice to have that control where\nyou completely pick exactly what it is\n\n221\n00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.570\nthat you want them to have access to.\n\n222\n00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.000\n&gt;&gt; Now Don, you were just\nmentioning different services.\n\n223\n00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.870\nWe're talking networking here and,\ntypically, yeah,\n\n224\n00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:44.940\nwe like to segment our networks\ndown to little private networks,\n\n225\n00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.970\nand then having the ability to\nroute between them is also nice.\n\n226\n00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:49.210\nInternet gateway, that's nice.\n\n227\n00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:53.055\nAre there other services that\nare available through the VPC?\n\n228\n00:11:53.055 --> 00:11:55.029\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n229\n00:11:55.029 --> 00:11:58.439\nThe routing instance,\nthe Internet gateway, it provides NAT,\n\n230\n00:11:58.439 --> 00:12:00.115\nNetwork Access Translation.\n\n231\n00:12:00.115 --> 00:12:00.905\nAnd NAT's kinda important,\n\n232\n00:12:00.905 --> 00:12:03.125\nwe're gonna talk a little bit\nmore about it later in this show.\n\n233\n00:12:03.125 --> 00:12:06.055\nBut you've gotta be able to translate\nfrom private to public IPs.\n\n234\n00:12:06.055 --> 00:12:09.655\nAll of your instances have privates\nIPs that are not Internet-routable.\n\n235\n00:12:09.655 --> 00:12:11.855\nSo when they pass through a NAT router,\n\n236\n00:12:11.855 --> 00:12:15.950\nit changes them to a public IP that is\nInternet-routable, assuming we want that.\n\n237\n00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.560\nYou might not want that.\n\n238\n00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.990\nThere's other services like DHCP,\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol.\n\n239\n00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.310\nHow do we get these private\nIPs in the first place?\n\n240\n00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:27.060\nWell, when you spin up a new instance,\nwhen I launch a new Linux AMI or\n\n241\n00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:30.990\nwhatever, when it comes up it gets an IP.\n\n242\n00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.950\nFrom AWS, from a DHCP service\nthat's running in the Cloud and\n\n243\n00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:35.740\nwe can configure that.\n\n244\n00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.630\nIt's much like a local DHCP server.\n\n245\n00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.330\nThe IP rangers were picked as part of\nthe VPC so that's already set up for us.\n\n246\n00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.712\nWe can just specify some other things\nlike what DNS servers they get or\n\n247\n00:12:45.712 --> 00:12:47.419\nwhat gateway they're gonna use.\n\n248\n00:12:47.419 --> 00:12:51.130\nIf you have Wins or NetBios,\nyou need to set node types.\n\n249\n00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:52.290\nYou can still do those.\n\n250\n00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:55.150\nIt's limited its not like a full\nblown DHCP server where you have\n\n251\n00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.265\ntons of options.\n\n252\n00:12:56.265 --> 00:13:00.520\nIt's really just designed to be enough\nto get your instances able to talk to\n\n253\n00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.130\neach other in the event that\nyou have more than one subnet.\n\n254\n00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:07.570\n&gt;&gt; Now we love our DHCP right it makes our\nlives very very easy and very very nice.\n\n255\n00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.480\nBut, there are times when we\nneed to do static IP's as well.\n\n256\n00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.700\nI'm assuming if we can do the http\nwe can also set static IPs.\n\n257\n00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.040\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and there's actually two\ndifferent ways to assigns static IPs and\n\n258\n00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.230\nit gets a little confusing.\n\n259\n00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:23.820\nI cover one of those ways back in the,\nback in the EC2 episodes right.\n\n260\n00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.700\nBut, let me get back to him by panel and\nI'm gonna jump over to EC2 for\n\n261\n00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:32.930\na second and in EC2 when I have an\ninstance That instance is gonna spin up,\n\n262\n00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.350\nI'll just launch one real quick.\n\n263\n00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.571\nIt's gonna spin up and\nit's gonna grab an IP from somewhere.\n\n264\n00:13:37.571 --> 00:13:40.090\nWell, where is it gonna grab it from?\n\n265\n00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.173\nIt's gonna grab it from\nthe vpc that it's a part of.\n\n266\n00:13:42.173 --> 00:13:47.094\nEvery time you launch an instance,\nthe instance has to ba a part of VPC and\n\n267\n00:13:47.094 --> 00:13:49.595\nit's going to become a part of one and\n\n268\n00:13:49.595 --> 00:13:55.870\nyou'll see here this instance has chosen\nvpc-df3dbaba, rolls right off the tongue.\n\n269\n00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.450\nThat's my default VPC,\nthat's why it's got a name like that.\n\n270\n00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.890\nWhen you create your own,\nyou can assign a name of your choosing.\n\n271\n00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.490\nNow, when I got to launch that,\nit's gonna fire up and\n\n272\n00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.110\nit's gonna get a dynamic IP address.\n\n273\n00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.280\nIf I want it to have a static IP address,\n\n274\n00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.680\none where it's always got it,\nthen I need to do an elastic IP.\n\n275\n00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.690\nAnd elastic IPs are available\nright over here in the EC2 panel.\n\n276\n00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:22.700\nAnd I can allocate an elastic IP,\nwhich would be a static IP that I keep.\n\n277\n00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.290\nAnd I can then go and\nassign it to the system.\n\n278\n00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:31.060\nNow, notice the elastic IP here is\na public IP address, not a private one.\n\n279\n00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.760\nIf it's a private address like a 10.0 or\nwhatever,\n\n280\n00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:39.050\nwell elastic IPs don't do that, elastic\nIPs are designed to be the public ones,\n\n281\n00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:41.310\nthe one the world sees when the access it.\n\n282\n00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:43.702\nSo there is another type that we can do.\n\n283\n00:14:43.702 --> 00:14:46.243\nLet me go back out to, or\nactually do we get it in here,\n\n284\n00:14:46.243 --> 00:14:49.240\nI can't remember if we see it in here or\nnot, I don't think so.\n\n285\n00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:54.430\nBut instead of doing an elastic IP, we\ndo an elastic network interface, an ENI.\n\n286\n00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:58.960\nAn elastic network interface has\nprivate IPs and we can attach\n\n287\n00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.960\nthat network interface to an instance,\nand it'll have a particular private IP.\n\n288\n00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:08.640\nNow, our public IP, this elastic IP that I\njust issued, we can take that elastic IP,\n\n289\n00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:14.400\nand we can associate it with an instance,\nwhich is what I did back in the EC2 show.\n\n290\n00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.030\nOr I can associated it\nwith a network interface,\n\n291\n00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.530\nan elastic network interface, an ENI.\n\n292\n00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:25.810\nAn ENI can have a public and\nprivate IP associated with it.\n\n293\n00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:30.200\nThe public IP comes from the elastic IP\nand the private IP comes from the ENI.\n\n294\n00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.800\nSo if I just want a static private IP,\n\n295\n00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.150\nI used an elastic network interface,\nand that's it.\n\n296\n00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:40.760\nIf I just want a static public IP,\nI use a elastic IP, and that's it.\n\n297\n00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.820\nBut if I want both, I create\nan elastic IP, I create an ENI, and\n\n298\n00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.530\nI associate the two together, all right?\n\n299\n00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:48.755\nI'm gonna associate this with an ENI.\n\n300\n00:15:48.755 --> 00:15:52.607\nWell, I don't have an ENI, actually I\nguess I have a couple laying around here.\n\n301\n00:15:52.607 --> 00:15:55.364\nThese are ones that were created as\npart of my machines that came up, so\n\n302\n00:15:55.364 --> 00:15:56.875\nI can go ahead and just associate one.\n\n303\n00:15:56.875 --> 00:15:58.973\nAnd then we can assign a private IP to it.\n\n304\n00:15:58.973 --> 00:16:04.529\nSo I'm using the 172.16 range, instead\nof the 10.range like in that slide So\n\n305\n00:16:04.529 --> 00:16:07.801\nwhen I do that it's going\nto attach the public IP and\n\n306\n00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:10.410\nthis private IP both to this interface.\n\n307\n00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:15.270\nNow, I'm attaching to a interface,\nnot to an instance.\n\n308\n00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.010\nWhy would I want to do that?\n\n309\n00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:21.110\nWell, if I ever have an instance\nthat I'm having a problem with\n\n310\n00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:24.030\nI can move the EMI to a new instance.\n\n311\n00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:26.040\nIts a great way to do upgrades, right?\n\n312\n00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.686\nI might have a instances up this running\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 and\n\n313\n00:16:31.686 --> 00:16:35.642\nI wanna upgrade to\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3.\n\n314\n00:16:35.642 --> 00:16:38.490\nAll right, well that's a big upgrade,\nits not what I'm gonna do in place.\n\n315\n00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.900\nSo I can bring up a second instance,\ncompletely configured,\n\n316\n00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.710\nget it working exactly\nthe way that I want it.\n\n317\n00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:49.300\nOnce its done I just moved the ENI over to\nthe new instance, and now the public IP\n\n318\n00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.430\nand the private IP both come over to the\nnew instance, and I'm done, I'm upgraded.\n\n319\n00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:54.700\nUnless things go wrong.\n\n320\n00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.130\nIf things really go bad, I just move the\nENI right back again, and I move it back\n\n321\n00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.090\nover to the old instance, now we're all\nback on the old instance, and off we go.\n\n322\n00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:04.830\nRight, so that's the kind of advantage\nof being able to things like this,\n\n323\n00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:07.335\nis that we can attach it, and\nnow we get that mobility.\n\n324\n00:17:07.335 --> 00:17:09.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Unless you get an error.\n\n325\n00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.430\n&gt;&gt; Now the permission just\nchanged to that resource.\n\n326\n00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:15.470\nI picked a ENI just blindly at random,\nit's probably one that's attached\n\n327\n00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:18.610\nto an Internet gateway,\nwhich you're not allowed to mess with.\n\n328\n00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:20.780\nThat's also why it's kind of\nimportant to name your instances so\n\n329\n00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.910\nthat you can easily spot them.\n\n330\n00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:27.530\nBut, I was doing this from the EC2 panel\nIf I jump back out to the VPC panel,\n\n331\n00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:32.420\nyou'll see a lot of those same options\nin there when I go into my VPC's and\n\n332\n00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.270\nI take a look at what's available\nover here on the left side you'll see\n\n333\n00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:38.140\nwhere I've got my elastic IP's right here.\n\n334\n00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.340\nWe also see our NAT options and\nout internet gateways,\n\n335\n00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:44.870\nour routing tables, it's all\nmanaged right here from one place.\n\n336\n00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:48.940\nAnd we go and create an elastic IP it\nwill show up right here there it is and\n\n337\n00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.450\nI can see if it's tied to an instance or\ninterface and work from there.\n\n338\n00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:53.460\n&gt;&gt; Dan is there a way for\n\n339\n00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:58.160\nus to right you were talking about adding\nyou know the IPs to an interface and\n\n340\n00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:02.720\nI'm thinking what if we had multiple VPCs\nis there a way to connect them together?\n\n341\n00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.920\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n342\n00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:08.730\nAnd a part of it is just making sure you\ngot your IP structure correct, right?\n\n343\n00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:12.590\nBut then beyond that,\nif they're your VPCs, if you control them,\n\n344\n00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:16.950\nyou can just set up the main routing\ntable and now they talk, right?\n\n345\n00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.680\nOoh, nice little caveat here,\nprobably not what you're asking about.\n\n346\n00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.080\nBut something I want to throw out.\n\n347\n00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.750\nThe default VPC.\n\n348\n00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:26.740\nIf you have a default VPC in place and\nyou deploy five instances,\n\n349\n00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.180\nthe five instances can\nall talk to each other.\n\n350\n00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:33.450\nBut if you create a custom VPC,\nwhen you create that and\n\n351\n00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.370\nyou throw five instances in there,\nthey cannot talk to each other.\n\n352\n00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:38.670\nThe default security group blocks them.\n\n353\n00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.680\nSo we're gonna talk more about\nsecurity groups in a minute.\n\n354\n00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.690\nBut I just wanna throw that out there,\n\n355\n00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.900\nthat your instances may not be\nable to talk in your custom VPCs.\n\n356\n00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.340\nThe other thing though is, what if I want\nmy VPC to talk to another service or\n\n357\n00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.740\nto another VPC all together, right?\n\n358\n00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.660\nWhen we create these they're virtual\nprivate clouds, they're isolated,\n\n359\n00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.690\nthey're separated, right.\n\n360\n00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:58.500\nWe don't want them talking to other\npeople, but if I have a need for\n\n361\n00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.940\nthat I can do it, all right.\n\n362\n00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.180\nAnd there's two main ways to do it,\nthere's peering and there's VPNs.\n\n363\n00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.700\nAnd with peering, well actually hang on.\n\n364\n00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.370\nThere's a couple of\ndifferent ways to do this.\n\n365\n00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.950\nLet's talk about end points and peering.\n\n366\n00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:11.770\nI'm gonna save VPNs for a minute.\n\n367\n00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:12.640\nThat's a big topic.\n\n368\n00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.590\nSo we'll talk about end points and\npeering.\n\n369\n00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:22.460\nWith end points, an end point is a way to\nconnect your VPC to another AWS service.\n\n370\n00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:26.460\nThere may be a service that I have\non AWS that I want my instances or\n\n371\n00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.880\nVPC to contact but\nnot be able to contact the internet.\n\n372\n00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.000\nNormally if I have something\nlike EC2 instance and\n\n373\n00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.290\nit wants to access Amazon S3, technically\nits crossing the internet to do it.\n\n374\n00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:40.890\nGranted that entire internet exists\nall within Amazon's infrastructure but\n\n375\n00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:41.860\ni am still crossing the internet.\n\n376\n00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:46.430\nAnd if I don't have internet\naccess I can't reach S3.\n\n377\n00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:51.390\nWell, you can define an end point and\nan end point says, here's my VPC,\n\n378\n00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:54.440\nit's private, it's not allowed to\nget to the internet, or maybe it is.\n\n379\n00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.250\nI'm going to create an end point so\n\n380\n00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.760\nthat other Amazon servers\nnow have access to that.\n\n381\n00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.960\nCurrently the only end\npoint supported is S3.\n\n382\n00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.730\nThat's why I use S3 as an example.\n\n383\n00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:06.630\nAmazon is going to add more in the future,\nbut for now you just have S3.\n\n384\n00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.990\nSo if there's an S3 bucket that\nI want a VPC to access but\n\n385\n00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.840\nthe VPC doesn't have internet access,\nI can create an endpoint for that.\n\n386\n00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:14.640\nAll right?\n\n387\n00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.570\nIf the VPC does have internet access,\nthere's not really a benefit for creating\n\n388\n00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:20.640\nan endpoint because they can just access\nit through the regular public IPs and\n\n389\n00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.220\nthat's that, right?\n\n390\n00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.110\nSo it's really only useful\nif you have a truly private\n\n391\n00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:25.699\nVPC that doesn't have internet access.\n\n392\n00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.790\nPeering is another similar type scenario.\n\n393\n00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:35.320\nWhat if I have a VPC and I've configured\nall of these servers and instances and\n\n394\n00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.590\nall these crazy things in there and\nyour company has a VPC.\n\n395\n00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:42.220\nYou've got a number of resources and\nthings in there and\n\n396\n00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.740\nI want my company to be able\nto talk to your company.\n\n397\n00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.300\nBut I don't want to go through\nthe Internet for this.\n\n398\n00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.280\nI don't want my VPC to have\nInternet connectivity, but\n\n399\n00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.640\nI do want to talk to your VPC, all right.\n\n400\n00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.340\nWell, here's where we can use VP Install,\nI'll talk about later.\n\n401\n00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:56.950\nOr peering.\n\n402\n00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:01.730\nPeering is where you connect\nyour VPC to someone else's VPC.\n\n403\n00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:04.300\nAnd that allows them to\ncommunicate together,\n\n404\n00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.760\nand they can exchange information.\n\n405\n00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.900\nNow this is not intended to be used to\nconnect your VPC to some of your other.\n\n406\n00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.380\nSo if I have five VPCs that's great,\nyou can do that.\n\n407\n00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:17.290\nBut if I have my VPCs where\nthey talk to each other\n\n408\n00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.500\nthen I really didn't need a VPC there,\ndid I?\n\n409\n00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:24.900\nI probably could have achieved\nthe same goal by using network ACLs or\n\n410\n00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:30.080\nsecurity groups and had it all on one VPC\ninstead of having multiple ones, but.\n\n411\n00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:35.620\nIf I want my VPC to talk to somebody\nelse's separate amazon account, will\n\n412\n00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.430\nthat's not really possible without going\nthrough the internet until we had peering.\n\n413\n00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.120\nWith peering you both\nset it up on each side,\n\n414\n00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.780\nit takes both sides to get it set up.\n\n415\n00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.890\nYour VPC will be able to\ntalk to VPC that's out there\n\n416\n00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.300\neven if it doesn't have internet access.\n\n417\n00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.190\nThat's another solution\nthat's available to us.\n\n418\n00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:53.280\n&gt;&gt; Are there any limitations\nto using the peering option?\n\n419\n00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.550\nThere’s limitations with everything.\n\n420\n00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:56.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The main challenge with\n\n421\n00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:00.160\nthe peering option is just that\nyou gotta get both sides involved.\n\n422\n00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.880\nBoth sides have to team up and\nget that set together.\n\n423\n00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:08.230\nIt does have some limitations that\nare done purposely to make it more secure.\n\n424\n00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.870\nSo, for example they're non-transitive.\n\n425\n00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.480\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n426\n00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.560\nLet’s say that.\n\n427\n00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.880\nI have a VPC, right?\n\n428\n00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:21.180\nThat's gonna be VPC A, and Daniel has\nVPC B, and you as the viewer have VPC C.\n\n429\n00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:25.870\nWell, you guys want to talk to my VPC so\nI let Daniel talk to my VPC,\n\n430\n00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:30.290\nbetween B and A, and\nI let you talk to my VPC, between C and A.\n\n431\n00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:33.080\nWell, does that mean that\nDaniel can now talk to you?\n\n432\n00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.110\nNo.\nSo, they're nontransitive.\n\n433\n00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.620\nIt doesn't allow one person to pass\nthrough the other and that's for\n\n434\n00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:39.770\nsecurity purposes.\n\n435\n00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:43.140\nIf you wanna talk to Daniel's VPC,\nyou two will have to get together and\n\n436\n00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.110\nwork that out.\n\n437\n00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:47.060\nSo, on a positive side, it's more secure.\n\n438\n00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:51.170\nOn a negative side, the VPCs involved the\nmore complex it gets cuz you're having to\n\n439\n00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:55.010\nset it up more and more times for\neach kinda trusted VPC,\n\n440\n00:22:55.010 --> 00:23:00.090\nas a result VPC peering like this is\nalmost always hard spoke, whether there\n\n441\n00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:04.590\nis one center VPC that other people want\naccess to, is not like a fool master, it\n\n442\n00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:08.605\njust becomes too much to manage, and it's\nusually indicate our bad network design.\n\n443\n00:23:08.605 --> 00:23:11.270\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, it's usually some other way we\n\n444\n00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:15.410\ncould configure things that would have,\nhave better met the needs of them all.\n\n445\n00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.190\n&gt;&gt; All right, well now lets talk security.\n\n446\n00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.400\nWe've been kinda like hitting\naround that bush so let's go there.\n\n447\n00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.860\nHow do we add security to our VPCs?\n\n448\n00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.890\n&gt;&gt; You know on the security side\nthere is actually quite a bit.\n\n449\n00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:28.840\nWe've got security groups\nthat act like firewalls,\n\n450\n00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.730\nnetwork access controls\nthat act like firewalls.\n\n451\n00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:32.820\nWe've got VPNs that act like firewalls.\n\n452\n00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.870\nSo again a number of different\nthings to get to and\n\n453\n00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:38.530\nI know I'm kinda short on time on this\none so why don't we do this, why don't\n\n454\n00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:42.220\nwe break this one up into a part two, and\nwe'll tackle security at a separate time.\n\n455\n00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:44.100\nBecause I wanna make sure,\nI don't wanna rush through it,\n\n456\n00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.381\ncuz it's probably the most important part.\n\n457\n00:23:46.381 --> 00:23:47.949\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; When you have a VPC,\n\n458\n00:23:47.949 --> 00:23:50.710\nit's all about isolating that traffic,\nright?\n\n459\n00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:53.370\nAnd if we configure security wrong,\nall the sudden it's not isolated.\n\n460\n00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:55.780\nAnd you might as well\nnot have a VPC at all.\n\n461\n00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.700\nSo, we need to sound the other\noptions that are available.\n\n462\n00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.840\nThere's a couple of neat ones that are\nthere and we'll tackle that in part two.\n\n463\n00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.560\n&gt;&gt; That's sounds good.\n\n464\n00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.667\nWe'll spare you the doing the micromachine\nman impression for this episode.\n\n465\n00:24:05.667 --> 00:24:06.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].\n\n466\n00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:07.350\nLet you do that part too.\n\n467\n00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.210\nDon, thanks so much for\ngetting us thus far.\n\n468\n00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:12.330\nWe hope that you will continue\nwith us in our part two.\n\n469\n00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:14.330\nAs for this episode,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n470\n00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:17.070\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n471\n00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.790\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n472\n00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.748\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n473\n00:24:19.748 -->

another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.051\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:20.051 --> 00:00:24.000\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\nMicrosoft Azure virtual machines.\n\n6\n00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.795\nAnd helping us out today in the studio,\njoining us, is none other than Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:28.710\nDon Pezet.\n\n8\n00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.780\nHow's it going today, Don?\n\n9\n00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.820\n>> It is going great Daniel.\n\n10\n00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.260\nThanks for having me on the show.\n\n11\n00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.765\nAnd for our first episode,\nour inaugural episode for Azure VMs,\n\n12\n00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:41.125\nwhat I wanna do is I wanna\nstart off kind of slow, right.\n\n13\n00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:42.935\nI'm just building up the suspension,\nright?\n\n14\n00:00:42.935 --> 00:00:45.815\nI want to start off with some\nbasics about Windows Azure.\n\n15\n00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:49.475\nI know that a lot of you guys\nwho might be watching this show,\n\n16\n00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:51.975\nhave exposure with Azure,\nthat you've already used it, but\n\n17\n00:00:51.975 --> 00:00:53.875\nsome of you might not,\nmight not have touched it at all.\n\n18\n00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:57.084\nAnd so, I just want to cover some\nbasics as far as what Azure is,\n\n19\n00:00:57.084 --> 00:01:01.204\nwhy we'd want to use it, why we even wanna\ndeploy this stuff in the first place and\n\n20\n00:01:01.204 --> 00:01:02.490\nwhat scenarios.\n\n21\n00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.490\nAnd then some of the considerations\nwe have with using it,\n\n22\n00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.080\nmost importantly being cost.\n\n23\n00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.950\nI wanna talk about how much\nmoney this is gonna cost you,\n\n24\n00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.050\nbecause to a lot of people getting\nstarted with Azure, that's a big concern.\n\n25\n00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.780\nThey just don't know how expensive this is\ngonna be, so I wanna take some time and\n\n26\n00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.985\ntalk about that.\n\n27\n00:01:16.985 --> 00:01:19.650\nNow if you've already been out\nthere working with Azure and\n\n28\n00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.510\nyou're just here to learn about the\nvirtual machines, you're not gonna hurt\n\n29\n00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.470\nmy feelings if you hit the fast forward\nbutton and jump to episode two.\n\n30\n00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.950\nBut, for right now,\nthe basics are kind of important.\n\n31\n00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.820\nWe need to make sure we understand how\nAzure works, to make sure it's a right fit\n\n32\n00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.606\nfor us because it's not necessarily\na right fit for everybody.\n\n33\n00:01:33.606 --> 00:01:35.138\n>> Speaking of basics, Don,\n\n34\n00:01:35.138 --> 00:01:39.610\nit really does come down to the type of\nscenarios that you might be dealing with.\n\n35\n00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.730\nAnd that's why you'd want to jump\nin to a cloud type provider.\n\n36\n00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.720\nSo I guess a good place to start with,\n\n37\n00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.312\nwhat are some of those types of scenarios\nthat would lend us to go that way?\n\n38\n00:01:49.312 --> 00:01:52.960\n>> All right, well let me give you an\nexample that I know that there have been\n\n39\n00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.300\nseveral white papers on this but,\nlet's say you work for an university.\n\n40\n00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.710\nAnd at the university, the College of\nMedicine comes to you and says, hey,\n\n41\n00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.080\nwe want to sequence the DNA genome for\nbats.\n\n42\n00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.820\nOr like I said it wouldn't\nbe College of Medicine,\n\n43\n00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.130\nit would be like Veterinary Science.\n\n44\n00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.060\nI don't know.\n>> It's a very important topic.\n\n45\n00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.990\n>> Well, bats, I guess, I don't know.\n\n46\n00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.020\nSo they want to sequence the human genome,\nright.\n\n47\n00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.900\nAnd they need thousands of hours of\ncompute cycles to do that, right?\n\n48\n00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.990\nNormally, you'd have a mainframe churning\nalong, cranking through this data,\n\n49\n00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.580\ndoing a lot of work.\n\n50\n00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.360\nAnd so they come to you and\n\n51\n00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.660\nthey say, look, we need x amount of\ncomputing power to get this done.\n\n52\n00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.190\nWell, when you look at it,\nyou could say, all right.\n\n53\n00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.070\nWell, I'm gonna go out and\nbuy 500 servers, and\n\n54\n00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.840\nwe're gonna build up a massive cluster,\nand we're gonna let them use it.\n\n55\n00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.080\nAnd you can do that, right?\n\n56\n00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.990\nIt's the way it's been done in the past.\n\n57\n00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.900\nBut, the problem here is what happens when\nthey're done sequencing the human genome?\n\n58\n00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.380\nThey're done, they finished, right.\n\n59\n00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.050\nThey put out the medical papers,\nget the fame and the glory,\n\n60\n00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.680\nand when all that dies down,\nyou're left with 500 servers.\n\n61\n00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.415\n>> Garage sale.\n\n62\n00:02:56.415 --> 00:02:58.006\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, well we joke about it,\n\n63\n00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:01.157\nbut I mean that's basically what happens,\nis you end up selling these things for\n\n64\n00:03:01.157 --> 00:03:02.100\npennies on the dollar.\n\n65\n00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.310\nYou lose a lot of money on that hardware,\nall right.\n\n66\n00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.820\nBut you did get the work done.\n\n67\n00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.250\nAlso, what if you said, hey,\n\n68\n00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.380\nif I have 500 of these servers,\nI can get the job done in a month.\n\n69\n00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.330\nBut if I had 2,000 servers,\nI can get it done in 1 week.\n\n70\n00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.990\nWould I rather get it done in one week?\n\n71\n00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.910\nWell, that would be nice.\n\n72\n00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.440\nBut now I've got to buy 2,000 servers,\nand not just 500.\n\n73\n00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.160\nIt's not realistic, right.\n\n74\n00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.960\nThose scenarios are scenarios that\nare always a challenge when we're talking\n\n75\n00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.830\nabout physical equipment.\n\n76\n00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.540\nYou're going out and\nbuying physical servers and\n\n77\n00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.090\nimplementing them yourself, right.\n\n78\n00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.020\nAnd that's not even taking into account\nthings like supporting all those systems.\n\n79\n00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.200\nBut with Windows Azure,\nyou pay as you go, right.\n\n80\n00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.159\nAnd I've got to stop calling it Windows\nAzure, I think that's the second time in\n\n81\n00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:43.220\nthe show and I'm rolling two minutes in,\nit's actually called Microsoft Azure.\n\n82\n00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.780\nIt was called Windows Azure\nin the beginning, but\n\n83\n00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.730\nit does a lot more than just Windows now,\nand so they called it Microsoft Azure.\n\n84\n00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.730\nAnd with Microsoft Azure, you pay for\nthe resources you need, so\n\n85\n00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.490\nif you need 500 servers for\n1 month, you can get that.\n\n86\n00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.340\nAnd at the end of one month,\nyou just shut them all down and\n\n87\n00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.860\nnow you're not paying for them anymore.\n\n88\n00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.180\nAnd so you paid for them when you\nhad them and that's it, you stop.\n\n89\n00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.620\nSo, it's way more economical.\n\n90\n00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.300\nAnd then in that scenario I gave you were,\nhey,\n\n91\n00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.720\nif it took me 4 weeks with 500 servers,\nwhat about 1 week with 2,000 servers?\n\n92\n00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.689\nWell, in Microsoft Azure,\n\n93\n00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:24.199\n1 week with 2,000 servers costs\nthe same as 4 weeks with 500 servers.\n\n94\n00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:25.568\nCosts the same.\n\n95\n00:04:25.568 --> 00:04:28.053\nYou pay for what you use, and\nyou're using the same amount,\n\n96\n00:04:28.053 --> 00:04:29.830\njust over a different time frame, right?\n\n97\n00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.320\nAnd so you pay the same,\nyou can get your work done faster.\n\n98\n00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.180\nThose are types, that are scenarios where\nMicrosoft Azure really comes in handy,\n\n99\n00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.190\nreally, any cloud service.\n\n100\n00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.660\nBut Microsoft makes it kind of painless\nbecause it's all built around Windows and\n\n101\n00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.310\nLinux, but it's done the Microsoft way and\nmost businesses and\n\n102\n00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.330\norganizations are Microsoft environments.\n\n103\n00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.850\nSo it's kind of easy, it's friendly,\nthe snap in from one model and\n\n104\n00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:52.920\nsnap in to the other.\n\n105\n00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.490\nYou move out of your physical premise\ntype model to the cloud model and\n\n106\n00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.560\nit's pretty painless.\n\n107\n00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.410\n>> So, kind of a not only pay as you go,\nbut even pay as you grow or\n\n108\n00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.490\nshrink depending on what your\nneeds are for the system.\n\n109\n00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.270\nSo, that's obviously a huge benefit.\n\n110\n00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.440\nIf I don't need those services,\nshut them off, right.\n\n111\n00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.980\nAnd if I need more, turn them on.\n\n112\n00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.710\n>> And I need more, right?\n\n113\n00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.340\nLet's hit on that.\n\n114\n00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.060\nThis is the day and age of the startup.\n\n115\n00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.600\nSo let's say you have an idea.\n\n116\n00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.230\nYou come up with a plan for\na new web service, right.\n\n117\n00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.563\nThink of Twitter, Facebook, MySpace.\n\n118\n00:05:24.563 --> 00:05:26.118\n[CROSSTALK] I almost said MySpace.\n\n119\n00:05:26.118 --> 00:05:28.439\n[LAUGH] You know Twitter,\nFacebook, Instagram.\n\n120\n00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:29.590\n>> Friendster.\n\n121\n00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.480\n>> Friendster.\n\n122\n00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.390\nSomething like that, or\neven Napster for that matter.\n\n123\n00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.580\nYou come up with an idea for a service.\n\n124\n00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.980\nAnd so you and a buddy, you sit down, you\nwrite the software, you're programming,\n\n125\n00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.850\nyou bring it upon a server,\nyou bring it online and people see it.\n\n126\n00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.960\nAnd you got 5 people on the server,\nand 10 people on the server, and\n\n127\n00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.130\n50 people on the server and\nit's running okay and then it goes viral.\n\n128\n00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.909\nSomebody post a YouTube video and\nall of sudden, it's out there, and\n\n129\n00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:55.869\nyou go from 50 users to 50,000 users,\nright?\n\n130\n00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:57.262\nWhat's gonna happen to your server?\n\n131\n00:05:57.262 --> 00:05:58.520\nIt's gonna get overloaded.\n\n132\n00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.860\nPeople get page not found, or\ncan't access server, or session time down.\n\n133\n00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.730\nIt doesn't work, it's like a denial of\nservice attack in a really bad way.\n\n134\n00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.660\nYou're not being attacked, you're losing\ncustomers, right, you're losing exposure.\n\n135\n00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.540\nSo with Azure, we have a neat advantage,\nwe don't have over physical servers.\n\n136\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.520\nWith physical servers,\nif I have five web servers and\n\n137\n00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.330\nthey start getting overloaded,\nI need to buy another one.\n\n138\n00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.260\nAnd so I call up Dell, or HP, IBM, Lenovo,\n\n139\n00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.440\nwhoever it is I'm buying servers from and\nI say, I need to order three more servers.\n\n140\n00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.110\nAnd so they send me a quote,\nI get the quote approved, we send it off,\n\n141\n00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.120\nthey ship them to me, I get the OS\nset up maybe within two weeks.\n\n142\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.800\nIf I'm lucky,\nI can get those servers up and running.\n\n143\n00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.880\nMaybe I already have\nHyper-V in my environment.\n\n144\n00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.640\nAnd so I can just spit out more virtual\nmachines, but I gotta go and do it and\n\n145\n00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.960\nconfigure those machines and\nget them up, right?\n\n146\n00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.430\nWell, it takes time to react.\n\n147\n00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.380\nBut with Azure, we can actually set\nit up to what's called autoscaling.\n\n148\n00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.040\nSo that when my server's at 50 users,\nit's just running off of 1 server.\n\n149\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.220\nBut when 100, 1,000, 2,000 users start\nto pop up, it starts cloning my system,\n\n150\n00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.140\nand we end up with 50 servers,\nand then 200 servers, and\n\n151\n00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.240\nthen 500 servers to support\nthe load that we're going under.\n\n152\n00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.920\nAnd then when things slow down,\nI can start to trim those servers back off\n\n153\n00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.630\nagain, so I'm only running\nthe amount of servers that I need.\n\n154\n00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.270\nAnd when I start trimming those servers\noff, it's not like I got these unused\n\n155\n00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.410\nassets sitting there costing\nme money day after day, right?\n\n156\n00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.820\nCuz if I power off a physical server,\nI've already paid for it.\n\n157\n00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.810\nDoesn't matter if it's powered on or\npowered off, I'm just saving electricity.\n\n158\n00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.410\nBut with a VM, when you power it off,\nyou stop paying for it and\n\n159\n00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:27.630\nyou save money, right?\n\n160\n00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.580\nAnd so, that's something that\nis just a huge advantage\n\n161\n00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.880\nby using a cloud service\nlike Microsoft Azure.\n\n162\n00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.480\n>> Now, one of the things I\nthink of when it comes to,\n\n163\n00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.920\nespecially Microsoft operating systems.\n\n164\n00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.753\nRight, you have to have a license for\neach one of your seats or per user, or\n\n165\n00:07:40.753 --> 00:07:44.080\nhowever you have licensing set up for\nthe software that you're using.\n\n166\n00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.560\nHow does that work inside of Azure?\n\n167\n00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.770\nDo I just?\n\n168\n00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.850\nI need another Windows server and I spin\nthat up and it's aptly, I don't have to,\n\n169\n00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.880\ndo I have to worry about\nlicensing in that sense?\n\n170\n00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.958\n>> You do and you don't, right.\n\n171\n00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:57.749\nSo I know this is gonna be\nthe non-committal answer of the day.\n\n172\n00:07:57.749 --> 00:08:02.727\nSo one of the cool things is that when\nyou spin up a virtual machine in Azure.\n\n173\n00:08:02.727 --> 00:08:05.316\nYou tell it what operating system\nit's gonna have and then that's it.\n\n174\n00:08:05.316 --> 00:08:06.543\nYou don't worry about the licensing.\n\n175\n00:08:06.543 --> 00:08:10.300\nSo, from one aspect,\nlicensing is no longer an issue.\n\n176\n00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.600\nBut, you do still have to be\naware of it because it's not\n\n177\n00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.620\nthat you aren't paying for\n\n178\n00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.785\nthe license, it's just that it's factored\ninto the cost of the virtual machine.\n\n179\n00:08:18.785 --> 00:08:19.760\nRight?\n\n180\n00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.610\nWhen you bring up a virtual machine\nin Azure, you pay per minute, right?\n\n181\n00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.530\nThat's kind of a cool thing.\n\n182\n00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:29.440\nIf you think about it, if I want to buy\na physical server I have to pay for\n\n183\n00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.430\nit all up front.\n\n184\n00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.570\n100% of it, right?\n\n185\n00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.180\nIf it's a $5,000 server,\nI've got to pay $5,000 on day one or\n\n186\n00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.260\nthey don't ship me the server.\n\n187\n00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.440\nBut with Azure, I could need\na $5,000 server for five minutes.\n\n188\n00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.770\nThen I could spin it up and\nI could just pay for the five minutes.\n\n189\n00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.180\nAnd when it's done I shut it down and\nthat's it.\n\n190\n00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.710\nI only pay for five minutes of usage,\nand that's it.\n\n191\n00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:52.530\nWell, that five minutes has\na per minute fee that we pay.\n\n192\n00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:56.340\nAnd the cost of the operating system\nis factored in to that, right?\n\n193\n00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.830\nSo, for the most part we don't\nhave to worry about licensing,\n\n194\n00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.770\nwe're already paying for it.\n\n195\n00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:03.770\nWe're just paying for it per minute\nas opposed to a perpetual license\n\n196\n00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.300\nwhich is what happens when\nyou buy physical equipment.\n\n197\n00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.260\nThe one time that that really doesn't\napply is when we start getting into some\n\n198\n00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.940\nof the advanced servers, right.\n\n199\n00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.920\nI've got pulled up on my computer here\nthe Virtual Machine's licensing FAQ.\n\n200\n00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.500\nAnd Microsoft breaks down a few\nof the scenarios where you might\n\n201\n00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.830\nactually have to worry about licensing.\n\n202\n00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.230\nSo, as I break this,\n\n203\n00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.791\nkind of scroll down through this,\nif I can scroll down through this.\n\n204\n00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:29.900\nYou'll see can I move\na Windows Server 2012 license and\n\n205\n00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.700\nimage between Hyper-V and Azure.\n\n206\n00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.260\nMaybe I've already got a server\nin my environment, and\n\n207\n00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.190\nI want to move it up to Azure.\n\n208\n00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:40.090\nAnd, if we expand that out, you'll see\nhere, Windows Server License's are not\n\n209\n00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.020\neligible for License Mobility\nthrough Software Assurance.\n\n210\n00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.850\nIn other words,\nyou can't move your own license up.\n\n211\n00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.300\nAnd that's because there's already\na license up there, right?\n\n212\n00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.500\nThere's already one in place.\n\n213\n00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.950\nYou don't need to bring one along.\n\n214\n00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.310\nYou have to build you're own image.\n\n215\n00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.790\nThere is a way to do it, but\nit's not the recommended way.\n\n216\n00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.360\nYou'll see other kind of\nthings in here like does\n\n217\n00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.460\na customer need Windows Server CALS to\nconnect to a Window's server image, right?\n\n218\n00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.062\nWhen you buy Window's Server it\nnormally comes with either five or\n\n219\n00:10:06.062 --> 00:10:10.090\nten client access licenses, and for every\nclient that connects they need a CAL.\n\n220\n00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.350\nAnd you've gotta have the right amount.\n\n221\n00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.250\nWell, when you bring up\nan Azure virtual machine,\n\n222\n00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.270\nyou don't have to worry about those CALs,\nright?\n\n223\n00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.230\nCALs are not required.\n\n224\n00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.450\nIt's kinda covered by it.\n\n225\n00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.590\nSo that's a license that you\nabsolutely don't have to worry about.\n\n226\n00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.550\nIt's already rolled in.\n\n227\n00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.195\nThe other thing is, when you start\nbringing up things like Windows Server\n\n228\n00:10:25.195 --> 00:10:28.850\n2012, in Azure it almost always\nbrings up data center edition.\n\n229\n00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:31.620\nWhich means it's got full connectivity,\nthe full feature set,\n\n230\n00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.310\nunlimited connections, and it's really\npowerful because what you're paying for\n\n231\n00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:36.910\nis basically to rent the hardware.\n\n232\n00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.280\nMicrosoft Azure, at the end of the day,\nis a platform as a service.\n\n233\n00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.710\nThey provide the infrastructure,\nwhich is all the hardware underneath,\n\n234\n00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.480\nthe networking, the hard drive,\nthe CPUs, the servers,\n\n235\n00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.690\nall that good stuff,\nas well as the redundancy,\n\n236\n00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.820\nthe battery backups, the power,\nalternate power supplies, and so on.\n\n237\n00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:58.240\nAnd they provide the operating system that\nMicrosoft Windows has already put there.\n\n238\n00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.520\nBut it's up to you to kind of support\nthat, and you install your own software.\n\n239\n00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.540\nWell, exceptions to that are Microsoft\nsoftware like SQL server and BizTalk.\n\n240\n00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:10.010\nAnd when you want those, you can choose to\nhave those already rolled into the virtual\n\n241\n00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.830\nmachine when it spins it up and\nyou pay a larger per minute cost on that.\n\n242\n00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.700\nSo you are still paying for the license.\n\n243\n00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.050\nYou do still have to pay\nattention to that cost.\n\n244\n00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:23.690\nThe only difference, though, is with SQL,\nBizTalk and a few of the other products,\n\n245\n00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.690\nyou can actually bring your\nown license if you want.\n\n246\n00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.780\nAnd if you do that, then you're just\npaying the price for the base server,\n\n247\n00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.680\nnot the additional software that's on it.\n\n248\n00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.850\nSo, that's one scenario we might\nneed to worry about that license.\n\n249\n00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:35.870\n>> All right, Don.\n\n250\n00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.120\nSo we're speaking about pricing.\n\n251\n00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.520\nWe're kinda different\nour toe into that water.\n\n252\n00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.370\nYou've mentioned that\nwe've pay buy minute.\n\n253\n00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:42.920\nAnd so, we start a server.\n\n254\n00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.670\nHow ever many minutes we use that server,\nis there any hidden fees or\n\n255\n00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.840\nways that I might have to worry\nabout they're gonna get me and\n\n256\n00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.780\nhamstring me with some extra charges?\n\n257\n00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.750\nHow do I know that what I'm getting\nis actually worth the money?\n\n258\n00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.490\n>> So, the cool part here is\nyou do pay for what you use.\n\n259\n00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.930\nAnd it's extremely low risk, and\nit is not like you have a contract, right?\n\n260\n00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.180\nYou mention hidden fees.\n\n261\n00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.270\nI instantly think cell phones.\n\n262\n00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.690\nAnd with cell phones you sign\na one-year contract, and\n\n263\n00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.720\nif you cancel early you gotta pay\na termination fee and all of that.\n\n264\n00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.180\nWith Azure, you just, you sign up.\n\n265\n00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.170\nYou do have to attach a credit\ncard to your account because\n\n266\n00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.350\nthat's what it's going to bill.\n\n267\n00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:19.450\nAnd when your done, you just turn off all\nyour VMs, delete all your storage, and\n\n268\n00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.170\nnow you've got a zero\ndollar bill every month.\n\n269\n00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.880\nAnd that's that, right?\n\n270\n00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.630\nSo, it really is kinda risk-free\nif you want to get in their,\n\n271\n00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:28.310\ndip your toes in and\ntry it, see how it goes.\n\n272\n00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.450\nIt's pretty low risk, right?\n\n273\n00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.400\nBut, the big challenge we have,\nand this is where,\n\n274\n00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.420\nwhen you're interacting with your CIO,\nyour IT manager, whoever,\n\n275\n00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:42.220\nthe biggest risk as they see it\nare the uncertainties of cost, right?\n\n276\n00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.130\nHow do I know how much\nit's gonna to cost me?\n\n277\n00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:48.235\nSure, when I buy a physical server,\nit might cost $8,000 and\n\n278\n00:12:48.235 --> 00:12:51.270\nI've gotta pay $8,000 on day one, right?\n\n279\n00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:56.360\nBut now I know for the life that I\nhave that server, it was 8,000 bucks.\n\n280\n00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:01.150\nAnd we can, what do they call that when\nthey take the cost of a server and\n\n281\n00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.280\nthey spread it out over time,\nit's like an accounting term they do.\n\n282\n00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.060\n>> Oh, yes.\n\n283\n00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.660\n>> They like depreciate or\nwhatever the, and-\n\n284\n00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.670\n>> Oh, that's a good question.\n\n285\n00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.550\n>> I know, this is where we start\ngetting into accounting stuff.\n\n286\n00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:12.864\nThere's all sorts of stuff.\n\n287\n00:13:12.864 --> 00:13:16.020\nThere's CapEx, or capital expenses and\nall that crazy mess.\n\n288\n00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:20.550\nBut they know what that amount is cuz they\npaid $8,000 on day one and that's it.\n\n289\n00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:24.730\nBut when you spin up a virtual machine,\nwell, the longer it runs,\n\n290\n00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.500\nthe more it cost you cuz you're paying for\na minute, right?\n\n291\n00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.010\nAnd how long are you gonna run it?\n\n292\n00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:29.991\nAre you gonna run it for six months?\n\n293\n00:13:29.991 --> 00:13:30.775\nAre you gonna run it for year?\n\n294\n00:13:30.775 --> 00:13:32.420\nAre you gonna run it for\na year and a half?\n\n295\n00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.950\n>> How much is that gonna cost me?\n\n296\n00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.630\nAnd then, if we dial it up, maybe one\nday it starts running low on memory, so\n\n297\n00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.020\nwe add some more memory to it.\n\n298\n00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.450\nNow we're paying more, right?\n\n299\n00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:43.900\nThe cost of that system becomes\na lot more able to fluctuate.\n\n300\n00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.460\nAnd managers, CIOs, accountants,\nthey don't like that.\n\n301\n00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:48.420\nThey like certainty.\n\n302\n00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.050\nAnd some of them would\nprefer to go ahead and\n\n303\n00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.780\npay more just to not\nhave that uncertainty.\n\n304\n00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:56.730\n>> So, with Microsoft they are very, very\ntransparent about the costs, and they try\n\n305\n00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.390\nand make it as easy as possible for you to\nevaluate what this is going to cost and\n\n306\n00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.850\nwhat it's going to look like if you decide\nto go with a cloud solution like this.\n\n307\n00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.800\nSo, let's talk a little\nbit about that pricing.\n\n308\n00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.330\nI've got pulled up right here\nthe virtual machine's pricing page.\n\n309\n00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.070\nAnd, I've said it more than once,\n\n310\n00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:15.850\nthat you pay per minute when\nyou run these virtual machines.\n\n311\n00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.950\nSo, when we come into the virtual\nmachine pricing page and\n\n312\n00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:22.160\nscroll down a bit,\nit starts to list the servers.\n\n313\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.140\nAnd then, to make the numbers\na little more understandable,\n\n314\n00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.105\nthey list them as per hour.\n\n315\n00:14:27.105 --> 00:14:28.870\nOkay?\nBut it's actually billing per minute.\n\n316\n00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:29.530\nThat's important.\n\n317\n00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.690\nBecause, what if I run the server for\n15 minutes?\n\n318\n00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.170\n>> I don't have to pay for the whole hour.\n\n319\n00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:35.482\nI just pay for the 15 minutes.\n\n320\n00:14:35.482 --> 00:14:36.170\nAll right?\n\n321\n00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.710\nSo, understand they list it here as per\nhour just to make the numbers a little\n\n322\n00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:40.565\nmore reasonable.\n\n323\n00:14:40.565 --> 00:14:44.370\nCuz the numbers are already really small,\nand that's where it gets kinda confusing.\n\n324\n00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:48.590\nSo, for example,\nif I want a single core system, right?\n\n325\n00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:53.342\nA server with just one CPU,\nand 750 megsof RAM, or\n\n326\n00:14:53.342 --> 00:14:57.530\n7.5 gigs, and a 20 gig hard drive.\n\n327\n00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.940\nThat's a pretty low end system, right?\n\n328\n00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.430\nI mean the real basics.\n\n329\n00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:08.050\nIf I wanted that, it would cost me\napproximately 1.8 cents per hour.\n\n330\n00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:10.300\nSo, less than $0.02 an hour to run that.\n\n331\n00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:10.830\nOkay?\n\n332\n00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:15.406\nIf we do that per minute, I'd have to\ntake $0.018 and divide that by 60, and\n\n333\n00:15:15.406 --> 00:15:19.130\nyou'd up with this super fractional number\nthat doesn't even add up to 1 penny.\n\n334\n00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.040\nAnd so,\nthat's why Microsoft puts this as hours.\n\n335\n00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.930\nIt just makes it easier to understand.\n\n336\n00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.599\nBut if I told you a server was gonna cost\nyou $0.02 an hour, what do you think?\n\n337\n00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.050\nThat's next to nothing, right?\n\n338\n00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:30.915\nI mean, that's really, really inexpensive.\n\n339\n00:15:30.915 --> 00:15:33.311\n$0.02 an hour is $0.48 a day.\n\n340\n00:15:33.311 --> 00:15:35.890\nSo, less than $0.50 a day.\n\n341\n00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:39.725\nSay a 30 day month, and you might have,\nwhat is that, 15 bucks a month?\n\n342\n00:15:39.725 --> 00:15:44.100\nYou run it over 12 months, you're talking\nabout $160, $170, something like that.\n\n343\n00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:48.370\nSo, that's how much you're talking\nper year if you run that server.\n\n344\n00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.827\n>> That's hardly anything.\n\n345\n00:15:49.827 --> 00:15:55.889\nSo, maybe you need a server that is\ngoing to act as a simple router,\n\n346\n00:15:55.889 --> 00:16:00.993\nor is gonna act as some kind\nof system that runs reports.\n\n347\n00:16:00.993 --> 00:16:02.356\nYou don't need a lot of\nperformance out of it.\n\n348\n00:16:02.356 --> 00:16:03.909\nYou just need a server to do this job.\n\n349\n00:16:03.909 --> 00:16:07.025\nYou can whip up one of these\nreally low end jobs and\n\n350\n00:16:07.025 --> 00:16:09.650\nit can knock it out extremely cheap.\n\n351\n00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.370\nIt can even get cheaper in some cases.\n\n352\n00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.040\nI'll show you in a minute.\n\n353\n00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.790\nBut, odds are we need more.\n\n354\n00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:19.918\nOdds are, we need 1.75 gigs or\n3.5 gigs of RAM.\n\n355\n00:16:19.918 --> 00:16:20.778\nWe need more memory.\n\n356\n00:16:20.778 --> 00:16:21.858\nWe need more hard drive space.\n\n357\n00:16:21.858 --> 00:16:23.830\nWe need more CPUs.\n\n358\n00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.920\nAnd so based on your needs,\n\n359\n00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.490\nyou can pick a higher tier virtual\nmachine and the cost starts to go up.\n\n360\n00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.210\nSo a pretty typical server for me is.\n\n361\n00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.030\nLet's see if I can find one.\n\n362\n00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:39.590\nI'll have to go into the special\ntiers to see a typical server for me.\n\n363\n00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:44.130\nBut here, something like this,\ntwo CPU's and seven gigs of RAM.\n\n364\n00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.900\nAll right, two CPUs, seven gigs of RAM,\nthis is pretty common for me,\n\n365\n00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.740\nthis is one of Microsoft's higher\nperformance servers here, and\n\n366\n00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.660\nit's gonna cost me 28 cents per hour.\n\n367\n00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.410\nSo if I were to spin that up,\n\n368\n00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:58.770\n28 cents per hour, yeah it's gonna\ncost me $200 to $300 a month.\n\n369\n00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:03.040\nBut, if I work that out over the course of\nthe year, it ends up being $3000 a year.\n\n370\n00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.030\nIf a server like that would\nnormally cost me $8,000,\n\n371\n00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:09.240\nthen in three years we\nbasically break even.\n\n372\n00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.850\nWell, in three years I'm gonna\nreplace the server anyway.\n\n373\n00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:13.670\nAnd so here, I don't have to\nworry about replacing the server.\n\n374\n00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.720\nIt's being replaced on\nthe back end all the time.\n\n375\n00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.450\nI don't even notice.\n\n376\n00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.280\nMicrosoft does that, we don't even see it.\n\n377\n00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.100\nBut we pay for what we use.\n\n378\n00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.950\nSo if I need 500 servers, just for\n\n379\n00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:27.450\na month I could spin these up and\nonly pay it for that month.\n\n380\n00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:31.170\nAnd yeah, it might cost me $300 per server\nfor that month, but at the end of the day,\n\n381\n00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:34.200\nI shut them down and\nI don't need them any more.\n\n382\n00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:39.020\nIf I buy an $8000 server and then I turn\naround and sell it on E-bay a month later,\n\n383\n00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:42.230\nI'm gonna lose a lot more than $300.\n\n384\n00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:44.090\nRight, those servers depreciate so fast.\n\n385\n00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:48.090\nYou're lucky to get 75% of their value out\nof them if you sell them one month later.\n\n386\n00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.540\nBut here, I can just burn 300 bucks.\n\n387\n00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.080\nAnd now I got it, I used it, and\n\n388\n00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.230\nI actually end up spending less\nthan if I used physical servers.\n\n389\n00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.670\nThat's the real advantage of Azure.\n\n390\n00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.000\n>> No real depreciation\nin any kind of value.\n\n391\n00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.130\nIt's I'm paying for this,\nI get that no matter what.\n\n392\n00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:03.190\nIt's always the latest and\n\n393\n00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.240\ngreatest kind of hardware because\nMicrosoft is taking care of that.\n\n394\n00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.050\n>> I don't have to worry about it.\n\n395\n00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:08.750\n>> Yeah, it's not like a house.\n\n396\n00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:09.420\nWith a house,\n\n397\n00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.780\nyou wanna buy a house you put the money\nin the house you gain equity.\n\n398\n00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:14.790\nYou don't really get equity in servers,\ncuz after five years you throw them in\n\n399\n00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.290\nthe trash,\nthey're not really relevant anymore.\n\n400\n00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:21.160\nSo we're not so much worried about having\na physical ownership of an item, and\n\n401\n00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.100\nwith this there's a lot of other\nbenefits that we'll talk about later,\n\n402\n00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.380\nthat makes it a worth while.\n\n403\n00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.540\nJust be aware that you have\nto choose the resources.\n\n404\n00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:32.520\nIf you need 16 CPUs and\n112 gigs of RAM, you can have it.\n\n405\n00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.240\nRight?\n\n406\n00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.340\nBut, you're gonna pay for\nit, $2.11 an hour over here.\n\n407\n00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.300\nAnd these prices are right now as\nof the taping of this episode.\n\n408\n00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.620\nThey go down all the time.\n\n409\n00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.370\nThe pricing changes so\nbe sure to to check that.\n\n410\n00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.950\nDon't build your budget\naround this episode.\n\n411\n00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:48.000\nMake sure you use Microsoft's website\nto find the latest information.\n\n412\n00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.860\nThe cool other thing is you can actually\nchange the specs of the machine\n\n413\n00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.040\nwhenever you want.\n\n414\n00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:57.560\nSo I might originally provision it\nas one core and 0.75 gigs of RAM and\n\n415\n00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.600\nthen a month later bump it up to\ntwo cores and 3.5 gigs of RAM.\n\n416\n00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.500\nAnd a month after that bump\nit back down to one core.\n\n417\n00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:08.710\nYou can go back and forth like that as\nyou need it to take care of peak time.\n\n418\n00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:14.370\nMaybe you're a retail outlet and\nso during the Christmas holidays\n\n419\n00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.130\nyou know you're gonna sell more and so\nyou ramp up the hardware on your system.\n\n420\n00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:21.700\nAnd then after the holidays are over\nyou bring it back down, and\n\n421\n00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.140\nyou start saving money again.\n\n422\n00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.710\nYou can do that with Azure,\nyou can't do that with a physical server.\n\n423\n00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.939\nYou can't say, I'm gonna stick 16\nextra gigs of RAM in there now and\n\n424\n00:19:28.939 --> 00:19:30.750\nI'll just pull that RAM out later on.\n\n425\n00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.460\nIt doesn't quite work that way, right.\n\n426\n00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.860\nSo that's an advantage.\n\n427\n00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.500\nAnother thing to be aware of\nis remember how I mentioned\n\n428\n00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.890\nthe Windows operating system\nlicense is built into this?\n\n429\n00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:45.510\nIf I scroll up here see how I've got\nWindows and Linux and SQL, BizTalk,\n\n430\n00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.860\nSharePoint, Oracle?\n\n431\n00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.730\nThese are other licensed products\nwith the exception of Linux.\n\n432\n00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:50.720\nLinux is free.\n\n433\n00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.010\nSo if I switch to Linux,\nmy pricing can go down.\n\n434\n00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:56.010\nRight?\nLet's take that expensive server.\n\n435\n00:19:56.010 --> 00:20:02.880\nUnder Windows if I do a, let's take,\nwho do I wanna pick here?\n\n436\n00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.610\nLet's go with A4.\n\n437\n00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:08.140\nAn A4 server with Windows,\n8 CPUs, 14 gigs of RAM,\n\n438\n00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:13.210\n240 gigs of hard drive space,\nand it's 61.6 cents per hour.\n\n439\n00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:16.920\nSo, we'll just say 62 cents an hour.\n\n440\n00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:21.809\nIf I switch that to Linux and\nI go back down to that same server,\n\n441\n00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.740\nnow it's 37 or 38 cents a minute,\nI mean an hour, sorry.\n\n442\n00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.390\nIt just got really expensive.\n\n443\n00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:29.350\n38 cents an hour.\n\n444\n00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:32.810\nI just dropped 25 cents an hour.\n\n445\n00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:34.498\nThat adds up over time, right?\n\n446\n00:20:34.498 --> 00:20:38.450\nThat 25 cents that I just saved that was\nthe Windows operating system license I was\n\n447\n00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:39.710\ntelling you about, right.\n\n448\n00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:42.290\nWhen I go to Linux, it's a free\noperating system in order to pay that.\n\n449\n00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:44.120\nSo when I said you don't have\nto worry about the license,\n\n450\n00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.010\nyou don't have to worry about\nit cuz you are paying for it.\n\n451\n00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.108\nSo [LAUGH] it's already paid for.\n\n452\n00:20:48.108 --> 00:20:51.540\nThere's other things that can influence\nthe virtual machines that you pick in that\n\n453\n00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:57.150\nprice, right so for example notice\nI'm in this Central US region Right?\n\n454\n00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:00.880\nMicrosoft has many data centers\nlocated around the world.\n\n455\n00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.360\nAnd servers can be more or less expensive\ndepending on where the data center is.\n\n456\n00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:05.980\nRight?\n\n457\n00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.520\nThe central US,\nif I remember right, is in Iowa.\n\n458\n00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.950\nAnd the servers are pretty reasonable.\n\n459\n00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:13.060\nRight?\nLet me go back to Windows here.\n\n460\n00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.360\nSo I'm going to do a Windows\nmachine in the Central US and\n\n461\n00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:21.580\nif I take that A4 server,\nwe'll call it 62 cents an hour, right.\n\n462\n00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.900\nIf I switch to a different data center,\nlike if I go to US East 2, so\n\n463\n00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.360\nI'm going to jump over to that.\n\n464\n00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.460\nThat's one of the newer data centers,\nit's got some impressive hardware in it.\n\n465\n00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.318\nIf I switch over to US East 2 and\nI go look at that same server.\n\n466\n00:21:33.318 --> 00:21:35.640\nNow it's 59.2 cents an hour, right?\n\n467\n00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.670\nIt's actually cheaper, and\nit's a nicer data center.\n\n468\n00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.410\nI'd like to pick this one anyway.\n\n469\n00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:42.970\nIt just got a few cents cheaper\nbecause of that data center.\n\n470\n00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:47.150\nWell, if I go somewhere international,\nright, maybe I'll jump all the way to,\n\n471\n00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.760\nyou do have to be careful.\n\n472\n00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.120\nSome things aren't\nsupported in some regions.\n\n473\n00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.350\nLet's go East Asia.\n\n474\n00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:55.910\nThat should be pretty expensive.\n\n475\n00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:59.380\nActually, Southeast Asia will probably be\nthe most expensive but I'll go East Asia.\n\n476\n00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.730\nSo if I pick East Asia,\nI'm gonna look for that A4 server and\n\n477\n00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:05.760\nnow I'm at, well, 70 cents an hour, right.\n\n478\n00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:10.440\nSo, depending on where you place the\nserver that's gonna impact your pricing.\n\n479\n00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.620\nNow, why would I choose different placing,\n\n480\n00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:14.770\nwhy wouldn't I just go\nwith the cheapest one?\n\n481\n00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:17.470\nWell, you've gotta think\nabout your customers, right?\n\n482\n00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.150\nA lot of time it benefits\nto have your server as\n\n483\n00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.130\nclose to the customer as possible.\n\n484\n00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:24.990\nSo if I have a lot of customers in China,\nI probably wanna go with\n\n485\n00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:27.700\nthat East Asian data center even\nthough it's more expensive.\n\n486\n00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:32.250\nIf I have more customers in California,\nthat East Asia server is actually not\n\n487\n00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:37.090\nthat far away But I could save some\nmoney by sticking it in US West.\n\n488\n00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:38.520\nAnd then it's gonna be\ncloser to those people and\n\n489\n00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.820\nit's gonna cost me less money\nkeeping them geographically close.\n\n490\n00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.320\nThat's something really hard\nto do with physical servers.\n\n491\n00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.360\nIf you buy a physical server and you want\nit geographically close to your customer,\n\n492\n00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:46.995\nwhat do you have to do?\n\n493\n00:22:46.995 --> 00:22:48.420\nCo-location.\n\n494\n00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.790\nYou gotta call around and find somebody\nyou trust that has a data center.\n\n495\n00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:52.799\nIt can be challenging.\n\n496\n00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:57.758\nThere's also some special regions,\nlike these U.S.\n\n497\n00:22:57.758 --> 00:23:01.520\ngovernment Iowa, U.S. government Virginia,\nwhich we're not allowed to use.\n\n498\n00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.850\nThose are the ones that are certified just\nfor the United States government, and so\n\n499\n00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:08.800\nif you're a government agency,\nyou can go in and you can use those, and\n\n500\n00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.639\nthe pricing will be, it's actually\na little higher if I remember right.\n\n501\n00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.670\nLet's go look at U.S.\nGovernment Iowa here.\n\n502\n00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:16.450\nOh.\n\n503\n00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:17.750\nIt's not even gonna show me.\n\n504\n00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:19.020\nSee, you'll find that.\n\n505\n00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.630\nSo I gotta contact my Microsoft rep.\n\n506\n00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.440\n>> That's our tax dollars hard at work,\nDon.\n\n507\n00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.430\n>> Yep.\nThat's right.\n\n508\n00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.110\nSo this whole page is dynamic.\n\n509\n00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:27.500\nIt's updating based on\nwhat I'm choosing here.\n\n510\n00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.520\nSo when I choose a different region,\nthat long pause, it's not that my\n\n511\n00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:35.060\ninternet connection stinks, it's that it's\nkind of recalculating the whole page.\n\n512\n00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:39.120\nSo, if I go Southeast Asia,\nit's going to pause or recalculate.\n\n513\n00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.260\nThe pricing page is\nactually really useful.\n\n514\n00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.862\n>> Is there anyway for us to figure out\nexactly what our pricing is going to be\n\n515\n00:23:45.862 --> 00:23:48.057\nbefore we hit that buy now button?\n\n516\n00:23:48.057 --> 00:23:51.387\n>> So yes and no, if this is an all brand\nnew product that you're going to be\n\n517\n00:23:51.387 --> 00:23:54.717\nrolling out and you don't know how\nmany servers you're going to need,\n\n518\n00:23:54.717 --> 00:23:57.068\nthen you don't know how\nmuch it's going to cost.\n\n519\n00:23:57.068 --> 00:23:59.779\nI mean, you just,\nhave to have data, right?\n\n520\n00:23:59.779 --> 00:24:02.745\nBut let's say that it's\nnot an all new project.\n\n521\n00:24:02.745 --> 00:24:06.470\nLet's say you've already got a data\ncenter, you've got 200 servers.\n\n522\n00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:10.400\nAnd you're thinking about moving your\nwhole data center up into the cloud.\n\n523\n00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.700\nThere is a way you can find out\nhow much that's gonna cost.\n\n524\n00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.450\nMicrosoft has this cool thing,\n\n525\n00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.010\nthis guy right here,\nthe Microsoft Pricing Calculator.\n\n526\n00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:21.920\nAnd with the Pricing Calculator,\nyou can jump in here, and you can type in\n\n527\n00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.600\nwhat you're gonna be using, and once you\ntell it that, it'll estimate the cost.\n\n528\n00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.840\nSo if I go in here to Compute, and I tell\nit that I want to do Virtual Machines,\n\n529\n00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.840\nI can come in here and\nstart to add in what I'm gonna do.\n\n530\n00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.843\nI'm gonna do some over in,\nwe'll do East US, and\n\n531\n00:24:36.843 --> 00:24:39.497\nI'll tell them that they're Windows VMs.\n\n532\n00:24:39.497 --> 00:24:42.018\nI'm gonna go with the standard tier,\nI'll talk about the basic and\n\n533\n00:24:42.018 --> 00:24:43.931\nstandard tier later, but\nI'll go standard tier.\n\n534\n00:24:43.931 --> 00:24:46.900\nWe'll do, maybe not A0s,\nthose kind of stink.\n\n535\n00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.480\nLet's go with A4 that\nI've been talking about.\n\n536\n00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:55.460\nAnd maybe I need 200 of these servers, and\nfor the hours that I'm going to need them.\n\n537\n00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.830\nThat's kind of a tricky one there.\n\n538\n00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:01.020\nSo for the hours that I'm gonna need them,\nI might wanna come in and\n\n539\n00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:05.580\nspecify that I need 200 servers for\n24 hours a day.\n\n540\n00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:09.190\nAnd if it's 24 hours a day, that would be,\nI should have picked something easier.\n\n541\n00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:12.253\nWe'll say we had 100 servers.\n\n542\n00:25:12.253 --> 00:25:17.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we needed them 24 hours a day.\n\n543\n00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.611\nNow, well that's not right.\n\n544\n00:25:20.611 --> 00:25:25.495\nSorry, for my hours here, I need to put\nin, it's the amount of hours, well,\n\n545\n00:25:25.495 --> 00:25:30.689\nlike here it's tell me 100 servers that\nare A4's would cost me $72 an hour.\n\n546\n00:25:30.689 --> 00:25:32.430\nIt's just kind of listing\nit per month here.\n\n547\n00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:35.494\nSo basically, I need to say like\n24 hours a day times 31 days,\n\n548\n00:25:35.494 --> 00:25:37.074\nwhich I don't know what that is.\n\n549\n00:25:37.074 --> 00:25:38.235\nDo you know what that is?\n\n550\n00:25:38.235 --> 00:25:41.195\n>> 24 times 31 [CROSSTALK]\nI'm not good at math.\n\n551\n00:25:41.195 --> 00:25:42.808\n[LAUGH]\n>> So 24 times 31,\n\n552\n00:25:42.808 --> 00:25:46.152\noh that was the default when\nI deleted that like a moron.\n\n553\n00:25:46.152 --> 00:25:47.115\nThere we go.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n554\n00:25:47.115 --> 00:25:48.749\n>> So if I have 100 of these servers,\n\n555\n00:25:48.749 --> 00:25:50.771\nit's gonna cost me $53,000 a month.\n\n556\n00:25:50.771 --> 00:25:56.097\nNow that sounds really expensive,\nbut if you've got 100 servers,\n\n557\n00:25:56.097 --> 00:26:02.590\nif they each cost $8,000,\nthat's $800,000, 50,000 a month.\n\n558\n00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.831\nYou divide that up,\nit kind of breaks even after two years.\n\n559\n00:26:04.831 --> 00:26:08.100\nIt all kind of boils down to that.\n\n560\n00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:10.850\nBut you can specify and kind of get\nan idea of what that's gonna to cost.\n\n561\n00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:14.954\nNow this tool's not terribly advanced\nlike I can't specify a bunch of different\n\n562\n00:26:14.954 --> 00:26:15.870\ninstance sizes.\n\n563\n00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:20.838\nSo Microsoft has another tool that, let's\nsee, do I have it open here somewhere?\n\n564\n00:26:20.838 --> 00:26:22.550\nI don't, but I have it downloaded.\n\n565\n00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:27.435\nMicrosoft pool tool out there called,\nI've got it floating here somewhere, here,\n\n566\n00:26:27.435 --> 00:26:30.810\nthe Microsoft Azure Cost Estimator.\n\n567\n00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:32.989\nYou can go to Microsoft site and\ndownload it, it's free,\n\n568\n00:26:32.989 --> 00:26:34.064\nyou load it on your machine.\n\n569\n00:26:34.064 --> 00:26:36.655\nAnd what it will do,\nis it will scan your network.\n\n570\n00:26:36.655 --> 00:26:38.722\nIt'll scan the servers on your network.\n\n571\n00:26:38.722 --> 00:26:42.827\nAnd it will catalog them, how much memory\nthey have, how many cores they have,\n\n572\n00:26:42.827 --> 00:26:44.747\nhow much hard drive space they have.\n\n573\n00:26:44.747 --> 00:26:48.243\nAnd then it will use the exact data\nfrom your actual data center to\n\n574\n00:26:48.243 --> 00:26:52.010\ngenerate a pricing sheet and\ntell you exactly how much it would cost.\n\n575\n00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:56.340\nBecause I might have some servers with\ntwo cores and some with eight cores.\n\n576\n00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.610\nI might have some servers with\n20 gigs of hard drive space,\n\n577\n00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:01.480\nI might have some servers with 20\nterabytes of hard drive space.\n\n578\n00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.810\nMight have some with 2 gigs of RAM and\nsome with 24 gigs of RAM.\n\n579\n00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:08.021\nSo it's going to figure that out and\ngive me the exact pricing,\n\n580\n00:27:08.021 --> 00:27:11.717\nand while I'm thinking about memory,\nI meant to mention something back\n\n581\n00:27:11.717 --> 00:27:14.640\nhere on one of these pages that I was on,\nwhat page was it?\n\n582\n00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.465\nThis one.\n\n583\n00:27:15.465 --> 00:27:20.584\nThese weird memory sizes,\nyou guys might have noticed like 3.5 gigs.\n\n584\n00:27:20.584 --> 00:27:22.348\nWhy doesn't it say 4 gigs?\n\n585\n00:27:22.348 --> 00:27:25.227\nOr 1.75, why doesn't it say 2 gigs?\n\n586\n00:27:25.227 --> 00:27:27.504\n7 gigs, why not 8 gigs of RAM?\n\n587\n00:27:27.504 --> 00:27:32.348\nWhat happened to the nice normal\nmemory sizes that we're used to, 1,\n\n588\n00:27:32.348 --> 00:27:34.863\n2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and so on?\n\n589\n00:27:34.863 --> 00:27:40.984\nWell, what Microsoft's doing is they're\nactually deducting the memory required for\n\n590\n00:27:40.984 --> 00:27:42.340\nthe base OS.\n\n591\n00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.300\nThey don't wanna falsely\nadvertise to you that hey,\n\n592\n00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.150\nyou get 8 gigs of RAM when the host\nOS is eating a gig of that RAM.\n\n593\n00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:51.100\nAnd so\nyou actually only get 7 gigs usable.\n\n594\n00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:54.536\nSo that's what they're showing here is\nwhat's the usable memory available for\n\n595\n00:27:54.536 --> 00:27:55.153\nyour system.\n\n596\n00:27:55.153 --> 00:27:58.860\nThe minimum system requirements for\nWindows Server is 1 gig of RAM, and\n\n597\n00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.819\nthat's why this starts at 0.75.\n\n598\n00:28:00.819 --> 00:28:02.375\nAnd that's the lowest they can go.\n\n599\n00:28:02.375 --> 00:28:05.155\nThey can't go any lower cuz it\nwon't be enough for Windows to run.\n\n600\n00:28:05.155 --> 00:28:08.230\nFor Linux, you could go lower,\nbut I don't think Microsoft does.\n\n601\n00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.310\nBut after that,\nthat's why these numbers are offset.\n\n602\n00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:11.990\nIt's the base operating\nsystem meeting those.\n\n603\n00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.730\n>> Well, thanks for\nbeing transparent there, Microsoft.\n\n604\n00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:14.640\n>> Eh, they're trying.\n\n605\n00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.567\n>> We appreciate the honesty.\n\n606\n00:28:15.567 --> 00:28:16.990\n[LAUGH]\n>> Don,\n\n607\n00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:20.870\nis there any other considerations that\nwe need to take in as a factor before we\n\n608\n00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:23.610\ndive into Azure as\na virtual machine solution?\n\n609\n00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:27.010\n>> Yeah, if you're talking to your CIO,\nyour CTO,\n\n610\n00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:30.460\nwhoever it is,\nit's easy to fixate on these costs.\n\n611\n00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.660\nAnd then you do what I did a moment ago,\nand you say well,\n\n612\n00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:37.290\nif a server costs me $8,000 but\nI'm paying $72 a month,\n\n613\n00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:41.570\nat some point, there has to be\na break-even price or whatever.\n\n614\n00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.760\nIt's really easy to fall into\nthat habit of comparing this\n\n615\n00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.650\nper hour price to what\nthe actual server would cost.\n\n616\n00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:51.110\nBut understand that when you buy a server,\nyou're not just buying a server.\n\n617\n00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:52.580\nThere's more to it.\n\n618\n00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.960\nThere's the electricity\nto keep it running.\n\n619\n00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.580\nThere's the battery backups to keep\nit up during the power failure.\n\n620\n00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.190\nThere's the network bandwidth.\n\n621\n00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:02.578\nThere's redundant network connections,\n\n622\n00:29:02.578 --> 00:29:05.680\nredundant fiber connections\nto a storage area network.\n\n623\n00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:08.500\nIf it has virtualization,\nthere's the host OS and the guest OS.\n\n624\n00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:13.258\nThere's just the maintenance,\nthe software licensing, there's all\n\n625\n00:29:13.258 --> 00:29:18.350\nsorts of other things that go along with\nthe cost of owning a physical server.\n\n626\n00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:22.100\nEven with the physical server, when you\npay that, let's say it's $8,000 and\n\n627\n00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:25.360\nyou buy it on day one, well,\nthe next year rolls around, and\n\n628\n00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.520\nyou gotta re-up the warranty, or\nmaybe you get a three year warranty and\n\n629\n00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.140\nyou need to go to four or five years.\n\n630\n00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.800\nThose are all unsaid costs.\n\n631\n00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.350\nCosts that aren't in the base\nprice of that server.\n\n632\n00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:38.620\nThose unsaid costs are a part of this.\n\n633\n00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:41.440\nMicrosoft already has battery\nbackups on all these servers.\n\n634\n00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:45.060\nThey already have redundant generators\nto keep them on in a power failure.\n\n635\n00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.690\nThey've already gotten more\nthan one Internet connection.\n\n636\n00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:52.120\nIf a hard drive fails, it's not you, it's\na Microsoft tech who runs over there and\n\n637\n00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.080\npops that drive out and puts in a new one.\n\n638\n00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.590\nIt's a Microsoft tech that sees\nthere's a problem with your server and\n\n639\n00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:59.610\nmoves your virtual\nmachine to another host.\n\n640\n00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:03.390\nSo you're getting employees,\nyou're getting hardware, you're getting\n\n641\n00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:08.960\nmaintenance, monitoring, all these other\nthings for that small hourly price.\n\n642\n00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.670\nAnd when you look at it that way,\nthe Azure cloud is so\n\n643\n00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:18.250\nmuch less expensive than owning physical\nservers that it's hard not to do it.\n\n644\n00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:21.450\nIn fact, there's really only a few\nscenarios I can think of where you\n\n645\n00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:22.670\nwouldn't want to go to a cloud.\n\n646\n00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.970\nOne example, data privacy.\n\n647\n00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:27.886\nIf you have a regulation, a law,\n\n648\n00:30:27.886 --> 00:30:31.379\nsomething that says your data\nhas to be completely private,\n\n649\n00:30:31.379 --> 00:30:36.187\nyou might not trust the Azure cloud, you\nmight not trust the Microsoft employees.\n\n650\n00:30:36.187 --> 00:30:39.278\nNow they are certified in a number\nof different regulatory and\n\n651\n00:30:39.278 --> 00:30:42.670\ncompliance standards, so\nthey've got most of it covered.\n\n652\n00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:45.050\nBut there's still some environments\nwhere you just can't use this, so\n\n653\n00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:46.540\nthat might be one scenario.\n\n654\n00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:50.080\nAnother scenario might be that\nyou need specialized hardware.\n\n655\n00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.880\nDaniel and I, we used to work together at\nan insurance company years and years back.\n\n656\n00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.250\nAnd at that company,\n\n657\n00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:58.190\nwe had a fax server which,\ndo you remember the fax server, Dan?\n\n658\n00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:59.850\n>> Oh, I remember the fax server.\n\n659\n00:30:59.850 --> 00:31:01.477\n>> It was a ray of sunshine, wasn't it?\n\n660\n00:31:01.477 --> 00:31:02.150\n>> It completely was.\n\n661\n00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:04.348\n[LAUGH]\n>> The thing about the fax server is\n\n662\n00:31:04.348 --> 00:31:08.012\nit had this special modem board in\nit that had, is it 8 or 16 ports,\n\n663\n00:31:08.012 --> 00:31:11.697\nsomething crazy on there, so\nthat we could receive all these faxes.\n\n664\n00:31:11.697 --> 00:31:13.650\nWell, I can't virtualize that system.\n\n665\n00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:15.970\nI need that fax board,\nI can't put that in Azure.\n\n666\n00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:18.770\nI'm gonna have to have a physical server\nfor that, there's no way around it.\n\n667\n00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:23.355\nSo there are scenarios where Azure doesn't\nwork, but pricing isn't one of them.\n\n668\n00:31:23.355 --> 00:31:27.781\nAzure always ends up being cheaper than\nyour physical server unless you do really\n\n669\n00:31:27.781 --> 00:31:32.153\nlike white box, build your own,\noff the shelf, non-name brand type server.\n\n670\n00:31:32.153 --> 00:31:34.925\nBut then you have a higher\nmean time between failure, and\n\n671\n00:31:34.925 --> 00:31:38.300\nyou end up losing all that savings\non the support side on the back end.\n\n672\n00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:41.825\nWe've all done it, we've all kind\nof worked in that environment, and\n\n673\n00:31:41.825 --> 00:31:44.486\nit's nice having Microsoft\nworry about that for us.\n\n674\n00:31:44.486 --> 00:31:48.000\n>> Yeah, when you buy a server,\nit's not just buying a box.\n\n675\n00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.740\nIt's a lot of things\nthat go along with that.\n\n676\n00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:54.670\nYou gotta pay a guy like me or Don here or\nmaybe yourself, to make sure it's running,\n\n677\n00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:55.670\nit's doing everything.\n\n678\n00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:58.280\nWhen we go into the cloud,\nthat all gets pushed off.\n\n679\n00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:02.032\nWe get to be freed up to do more important\nthings, developing infrastructure,\n\n680\n00:32:02.032 --> 00:32:03.320\nworking support tickets,\n\n681\n00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:06.970\nthings that are much more important\nthan swapping out hard drives and stuff.\n\n682\n00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:07.620\nSo Don,\n\n683\n00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:11.130\nis there anything else we need to cover\nin this show before we close it down?\n\n684\n00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:12.350\n>> That's it for the basics.\n\n685\n00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:16.140\nWe're gonna move on to talking about\nactually creating the VMs, and\n\n686\n00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.850\nI know I showed some information up here\nthat I didn't explain in great detail.\n\n687\n00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:21.670\nWe're gonna see that in\nthe upcoming episodes.\n\n688\n00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:23.220\nSo we got a lot more to go into.\n\n689\n00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:25.690\nBut I just wanted to make sure I started\noff with the basics of Azure for\n\n690\n00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:28.430\nthose of you that haven't used it or\naren't familiar with it.\n\n691\n00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:30.207\nIt really is a great system,\nyou'll enjoy it.\n\n692\n00:32:30.207 --> 00:32:31.213\nIt's pretty easy to use and\n\n693\n00:32:31.213 --> 00:32:34.294\ndefinitely something you'll wanna take\nadvantage of out there in the real world.\n\n694\n00:32:34.294 --> 00:32:35.900\n>> That's right, excellent stuff, Don.\n\n695\n00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.090\nThanks for joining us today.\n\n696\n00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:39.710\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n697\n00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:40.938\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n698\n00:32:40.938 --> 00:32:41.693\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n699\n00:32:41.693 --> 00:32:42.597\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n700\n00:32:42.597 --> 00:32:47.783\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:07.107\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:08.842\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.897\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:11.897 --> 00:00:13.215\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone.\n\n7\n00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:16.500\nAnd welcome to another\ngreat episode of ITPRO.TV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.580\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n9\n00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.159\nAnd in today's episode, well we\nare kicking off our CHFI version 9 series.\n\n10\n00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:25.840\nAnd joining us in the studio,\nthe man, the myth, the legend.\n\n11\n00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.550\nYou know him as Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.590\nAdam, welcome back sir.\n\n13\n00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.450\nHow's it going?\n\n14\n00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.160\n&gt;&gt; Good, good.\nThank you.\n\n15\n00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.480\nVersion 9,\nbecause it's better than version 8.\n\n16\n00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.580\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; That's what we're going with.\n\n17\n00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.560\n&gt;&gt; Now with more versioning.\n\n18\n00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.050\n&gt;&gt; Now with more versioning,\nthan we have with version 8.\n\n19\n00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.150\nSo glad to be back.\n\n20\n00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.910\nGlad to be spending time\nwith you as always.\n\n21\n00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.530\nWe're gonna start talking about CHFI.\n\n22\n00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.540\nVery exciting area of knowledge and\ncontent.\n\n23\n00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.630\nHopefully you'll find it to be so,\nComputer Hacking Forensics Investigation.\n\n24\n00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.458\nGenerically computer forensics, you hear\nit often referred to as digital forensics.\n\n25\n00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:56.890\nWhat we're gonna be spending time\non talking about working with and\n\n26\n00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.760\nthinking through,\nis the logic of how we do\n\n27\n00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.440\ninvestigations on computer related crimes,\ncrimes that involve computers.\n\n28\n00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.117\nHacking incidence for instance,\npeople that who have used computers to\n\n29\n00:01:08.117 --> 00:01:10.658\nachieve some nefarious,\nand whatever it may be.\n\n30\n00:01:10.658 --> 00:01:14.462\nAnd the methodological procedures and\ntechniques that help us to identify,\n\n31\n00:01:14.462 --> 00:01:18.793\ngather, preserve, extract, interpret,\ndocument and ultimately examine evidence\n\n32\n00:01:18.793 --> 00:01:22.948\nfrom multiple perspectives is really what\ncomputer forensics will be all about, or\n\n33\n00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:24.460\nwhat we will focus on.\n\n34\n00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.020\nAnd most importantly in ways\nthat are legally admissible.\n\n35\n00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.390\nIt's not just enough to say hey,\n\n36\n00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.930\nby the way we wanna go out,\nwe wanna gather evidence.\n\n37\n00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.850\nCuz we could certainly do that.\n\n38\n00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.380\nBut if we do it in a way that is not\nperceived in a court of law according\n\n39\n00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.390\nto the rules of evidence to be legitimate,\nand therefore allowable, admissible.\n\n40\n00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.960\nIt's the term that we will use.\n\n41\n00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.080\nThen whatever we have done,\nthe activities will engaged in and\n\n42\n00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.180\nthe fruits of that labor will enforce\nshould be read or null and void.\n\n43\n00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.162\nWe will not in other words,\nhave access to the information.\n\n44\n00:01:52.162 --> 00:01:56.735\nWe'll not be able to leverage in use that\ninformation in order to further prosecute\n\n45\n00:01:56.735 --> 00:02:00.584\nor to pursue any leads that come from\nthat, or to pursue a case in a court\n\n46\n00:02:00.584 --> 00:02:04.833\nof law, and potentially bring somebody\nbefore the court seeking justice for\n\n47\n00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:07.040\nwrongs they may have committed.\n\n48\n00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.920\nAnd you see this on TV, you see this in\nmovies all the time, as part of a story\n\n49\n00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.380\nline where somebody does somethings,\nthere is then an investigation.\n\n50\n00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.910\nAnd if a rule, whatever the rule may be,\n\n51\n00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.420\nwhatever the story line is,\nperhaps it's not followed correctly.\n\n52\n00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.630\nMaybe the law enforcement, people legal\nagents were acting on behalf of them.\n\n53\n00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.760\nWhatever the case was,\ndid not get a search warrant, or\n\n54\n00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.680\ndid get a search warrant, but\nexceeded the scope, the boundary,\n\n55\n00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.240\nand the coverage of the search warrant.\n\n56\n00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.960\nOr maybe because of extenuating\ncircumstances, they went ahead and\n\n57\n00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.560\nengaged in certain activities.\n\n58\n00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.860\nAnd then had to validate before\na judge that those activities and\n\n59\n00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.780\nthe things they did were warranted.\n\n60\n00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.870\nWere allowed because of extenuating or\nwhat we call exigent circumstances.\n\n61\n00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.140\nAll these variations.\n\n62\n00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.138\n&gt;&gt; Adam,\nI've watched plenty of gritty cop dramas.\n\n63\n00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:55.200\nAnd I'll know,is all you have to do\nis say I heard someone yell for help.\n\n64\n00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.135\nAnd then you can go and\ndo whatever you want.\n\n65\n00:02:56.135 --> 00:02:58.227\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well you can do that,\n\n66\n00:02:58.227 --> 00:02:59.150\nthat is very true.\n\n67\n00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.890\nBut doing whatever you want,\nall kidding aside, we're joking, but\n\n68\n00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.900\nraises a really interesting\npoint under the thought process,\n\n69\n00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.760\naround the thought process\nas we interpret this.\n\n70\n00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.050\nThe idea is that yes,\nwhat we just described,\n\n71\n00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.190\nwhat we call exigent circumstance, right?\n\n72\n00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.890\nSituational things that are happening\nthat normally we would say,\n\n73\n00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.020\nhey you are not allowed to go\nbreak open that door, right?\n\n74\n00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.135\nBut somebody yelling, help,\nI'm being held hostage, help,\n\n75\n00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:25.740\nsomeone's got a gun to my head,\nwhatever they yell.\n\n76\n00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.264\nOr you believe as a law enforcement\nofficer that somebody is about\n\n77\n00:03:30.264 --> 00:03:33.060\nto either have bodily harm done to them or\n\n78\n00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.601\nsomething someone will be harmed\nirreparably if you don't act.\n\n79\n00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:39.081\nYou have a little room,\n\n80\n00:03:39.081 --> 00:03:43.500\nright, under the interpretation\nin law to be able to take action.\n\n81\n00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.050\nBut that doesn't mean\nthat you can do anything.\n\n82\n00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.438\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It means that you are allowed to do\n\n83\n00:03:46.438 --> 00:03:47.320\ncertain things.\n\n84\n00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.810\nYou are allowed to go in and investigate.\n\n85\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.910\nYou are allowed to try to\nsafe guard that life, right?\n\n86\n00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.550\nWe can stop somebody from\ntrying to shoot somebody\n\n87\n00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.990\nby shooting them if there's\na clear threat, present danger.\n\n88\n00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.702\nBut that doesn't mean we can then go and\nbroadly search, and do anything we wanna\n\n89\n00:04:02.702 --> 00:04:06.738\ndo within that scene until we have\nestablished certain parameters.\n\n90\n00:04:06.738 --> 00:04:09.192\nUntil we understand better\nwhat has happened, and\n\n91\n00:04:09.192 --> 00:04:13.359\nuntil depending on the circumstances, we\nmay have received additional permission in\n\n92\n00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.841\nthe form of writing, typically\na search warrant, from an authorized,\n\n93\n00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:20.435\nin this case probably a court of law\njudge, has issued a warrant that says,\n\n94\n00:04:20.435 --> 00:04:22.410\nyes you're allowed to go search.\n\n95\n00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.570\nNow if it's a crime scene we happen on\nafter the fact, very different, right?\n\n96\n00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.090\nWe walk in, and there are unfortunately\nbodies, perhaps laying on the ground.\n\n97\n00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.460\nSomebody's been harmed,\nthere's clear evidence of a crime.\n\n98\n00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.150\nWe at that point may be able to operate\ndifferently, we're able to investigate,\n\n99\n00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.780\nwe're able to go look in the pockets of\nthe person that may have been harmed that\n\n100\n00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.630\nwas attacked, because now they're part of\nwhat happened, part of the crime scene.\n\n101\n00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.090\nSo it does depend on circumstances,\nas you rightly point out.\n\n102\n00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.790\nAnd it depends on what we are being\nasked to do in the circumstances,\n\n103\n00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.930\nor then surround the circumstances\nthat we find ourselves to be involved.\n\n104\n00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.920\nI'll have a lot more to say about\nthat in coming discussions.\n\n105\n00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.956\nBut the objectives of\ncomputer forensics overall,\n\n106\n00:05:02.956 --> 00:05:05.721\nthinking through the logic\nof what we wanna do.\n\n107\n00:05:05.721 --> 00:05:08.400\nI'm gonna actually put a list up here.\n\n108\n00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.690\nIf you just bear with me for\none second, there we go.\n\n109\n00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.170\nIf we can go full screen,\njust so you can see this.\n\n110\n00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.210\nThat way we don't cut\noff there on the margin.\n\n111\n00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.100\nAnd a lot of this stuff we'll talk\nabout in these beginning episodes is\n\n112\n00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.180\ngonna involve me throwing\nup a list of things.\n\n113\n00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.350\nEspecially as we get into the rules\nof evidence, and talk through them.\n\n114\n00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:24.810\nBecause there's just a lot of verbage,\n\n115\n00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.650\nand a lot of detail that you\nwanna make sure you're aware of.\n\n116\n00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.240\nAll of this is in the show notes,\nobviously encourage\n\n117\n00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.870\nyou as we always do to take a look and\nuse those as a guide to help you prepare.\n\n118\n00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.340\nNot only to apply this\nknowledge in the real world,\n\n119\n00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.690\nbut those of you that may be looking\nto go on and perhaps study for and\n\n120\n00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.220\ntake one or more exams in this case to see\nat your final exam, you would wanna use\n\n121\n00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.470\nthis information to help you to prepare,\nso objectives of computer forensic.\n\n122\n00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.800\nNot an exhaustive list, but\ncertainly a major point list if you will.\n\n123\n00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.580\nThings that are very likely to be\nconsidered main objectives are on this\n\n124\n00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.310\nlist, and identifying, gathering, and\n\n125\n00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.810\npreserving evidence of a cyber\ncrime in this case, right?\n\n126\n00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.180\nWould be at the top of the list.\n\n127\n00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.340\nTracking and prosecuting perpetrators\nthat may have executed this crime in\n\n128\n00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.060\nwhatever court of law has jurisdiction,\nwherever the crime was committed we\n\n129\n00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.370\nwould seek to then gain\naccess to the court there and\n\n130\n00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.270\nprosecute a case if appropriate,\nif we have evidence, if we are allowed to.\n\n131\n00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.410\nIn that jurisdiction,\nwe'll talk more about jurisdiction and\n\n132\n00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.960\nthe ability to be able to deal with the\nspecific interpretation of law by country\n\n133\n00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.610\nin upcoming conversations as well.\n\n134\n00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.570\nBut remember, law generically\n\n135\n00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.030\nis the same everywhere we go in\nthe sense that almost without exception,\n\n136\n00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:42.090\nevery country will have a set of laws that\naddresses things like what is a crime?\n\n137\n00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.330\nHow was it committed?\n\n138\n00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.150\nUnder what circumstances do we or don't\nwe have the right to seek redress and\n\n139\n00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.800\nto prosecute a court or\nrather prosecute a crime that occurred?\n\n140\n00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.590\nBut every country will interpret\ntheir laws differently,\n\n141\n00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.140\nwill apply them differently, and\nwill draft them differently.\n\n142\n00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.180\nAnd as a broad statement, not every\ncountry will be different because many\n\n143\n00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.650\ncountries come from the perspective or\n\n144\n00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.430\nshare the perspective of a common\nfoundation for their legal systems,\n\n145\n00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.890\nwhether it's common law under the English\nsystem or whatever the case may be.\n\n146\n00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.950\nAnd as a result,\nthere's a lot of similarity there.\n\n147\n00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.290\nBut there are unique differences and\nsubtle differences that we need to be\n\n148\n00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:22.410\naware of as forensics experts,\nas investigators, as representatives of\n\n149\n00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.880\na process that allows us to gather\ninformation and allows us to do so\n\n150\n00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.550\non a forensically sound and appropriate\nway following the rules of evidence.\n\n151\n00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.990\nWhatever they may be\nbased on the locality and\n\n152\n00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.970\nthe legal jurisdictions enforced there.\n\n153\n00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.470\nAnd following and establishing\na chain of custody of evidence for\n\n154\n00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.580\nan important term that we'll come\nback to time and again here.\n\n155\n00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.820\nWe have to follow the rules in other\nwords and play the game correctly.\n\n156\n00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.468\nTo then seek the end game that\nwe're looking for, and hopefully,\n\n157\n00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:49.520\nif everything goes well.\n\n158\n00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.879\nAnd we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat somebody legitimately seems to have\n\n159\n00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:55.510\nengaged in these activities.\n\n160\n00:07:55.510 --> 00:08:00.300\nBring them before the court and\nallow a jury or a judge depending on the.\n\n161\n00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.990\nCourt that we are in and the kind of legal\nsystem we are involved with to render\n\n162\n00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.730\na ruling as to whether they\nare innocent or guilty.\n\n163\n00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.990\nAnd if innocent,\nallow them to go on their way.\n\n164\n00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.910\nIf guilty, allow for some sort of\npunishment, whatever may be allowed and\n\n165\n00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.650\napplicable under the law to be assigned,\nwhether it's a criminal case or\n\n166\n00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:17.860\na civil case.\n\n167\n00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.330\nAgain, depending on the kind of law and\nlegal system we're in\n\n168\n00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.620\ncriminal case would involve traditionally\njail time, if found guilty.\n\n169\n00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.910\nWhereas a civil case would traditionally\ninvolve some sort of financial penalty,\n\n170\n00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:29.865\nif you are found guilty.\n\n171\n00:08:29.865 --> 00:08:32.570\nAnd there may be some other\nthings that go on with that, but\n\n172\n00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.835\nthose are the main thought processes\naround criminal versus civil cases.\n\n173\n00:08:36.835 --> 00:08:39.745\nSo we have to think about\nthese things as we think about\n\n174\n00:08:39.745 --> 00:08:41.785\nthe objectives of computer forensics.\n\n175\n00:08:41.785 --> 00:08:45.117\nWe also have to look at the fact\nthat we may interpret document and\n\n176\n00:08:45.117 --> 00:08:47.830\npresent evidence and\nhave to do so, as I mentioned,\n\n177\n00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.432\nin an admissible way that would allow for\nprosecution to take place.\n\n178\n00:08:51.432 --> 00:08:55.986\nAgain, if appropriate, if the evidence\nwarrants that, supports it, and\n\n179\n00:08:55.986 --> 00:09:00.538\nleads to the decision in our minds and\nour ability to present that in a court of\n\n180\n00:09:00.538 --> 00:09:04.237\nlaw and a court of our peers that\nthere seems to be wrongdoing,\n\n181\n00:09:04.237 --> 00:09:08.022\nseems to be malfeasance that\nwe want to pursue in some way.\n\n182\n00:09:08.022 --> 00:09:13.172\nSo if we walk into a crime scene,\nfind evidence overwhelmingly of some\n\n183\n00:09:13.172 --> 00:09:18.083\nsort of crime taking place and\none or more people's involvement.\n\n184\n00:09:18.083 --> 00:09:21.939\nIf we handled it correctly should be\nable to then present that evidence after\n\n185\n00:09:21.939 --> 00:09:25.027\nan exhaustive methodological\napproach that's supplied.\n\n186\n00:09:25.027 --> 00:09:28.561\nAnd we'll go through what the steps are,\nthe rules of forensic investigation, and\n\n187\n00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:31.710\nthe way in which we apply that\nmethodology here in a couple of minutes.\n\n188\n00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.766\nBut assuming we do that, we should\nthen have the opportunity to present\n\n189\n00:09:35.766 --> 00:09:38.943\nthat information in front of a court,\nand proceed, and\n\n190\n00:09:38.943 --> 00:09:42.478\nbe a part of that investigation,\nculminating in that trial.\n\n191\n00:09:42.478 --> 00:09:47.271\nAnd allow the prosecution and the defense\nto present their versions of that story,\n\n192\n00:09:47.271 --> 00:09:49.132\nrefute or accept our evidence.\n\n193\n00:09:49.132 --> 00:09:50.807\nAnd then, depending on what happens,\n\n194\n00:09:50.807 --> 00:09:53.610\nseeing whether that person\nis found innocent or guilty.\n\n195\n00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.780\nAnd that is the process at a high level,\nand that's what should happen.\n\n196\n00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:01.084\nThe idea is, and this very important\nthought process will be started out,\n\n197\n00:10:01.084 --> 00:10:04.380\nbegin our conversations through\nthe logic of what CHFI?\n\n198\n00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.603\nWhat hacking forensic investigation means?\n\n199\n00:10:06.603 --> 00:10:10.125\nUltimately what cyber crime is and\nhow digitally, how we go through digital\n\n200\n00:10:10.125 --> 00:10:13.870\nforensics and computer forensics to\nunderstand how we are supposed to operate,\n\n201\n00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.000\ngather evidence, to present it.\n\n202\n00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.340\nOne of the overarching and underlying\nassumptions we must make at all times\n\n203\n00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:24.110\nas investigators is that everything\nwe do will be under scrutiny.\n\n204\n00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:28.185\nEverything we do can potentially be used\nin the court of law to present evidence,\n\n205\n00:10:28.185 --> 00:10:30.205\nshould there be a compelling\nreason to do so.\n\n206\n00:10:30.205 --> 00:10:33.355\nWe always have to operate under\nthe assumption that that will be the case.\n\n207\n00:10:33.355 --> 00:10:35.445\nMeaning, we must always\nfollow the rules of evidence,\n\n208\n00:10:35.445 --> 00:10:39.305\nwe must always act appropriately, follow\nour code of ethic, whatever that is.\n\n209\n00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:41.335\nFollow the standards of our occupation,\n\n210\n00:10:41.335 --> 00:10:44.285\nour industry and\nthe appropriate rules that govern that.\n\n211\n00:10:44.285 --> 00:10:47.189\nWe'll talk about where some of those\nthings may come from here as we go.\n\n212\n00:10:47.189 --> 00:10:51.389\nAnd making sure that we understand\nhow to always, without exception,\n\n213\n00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:55.171\noperate in a way that creates\nauditability, verifiability and\n\n214\n00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:57.002\nvalidity in everything we do.\n\n215\n00:10:57.002 --> 00:11:01.001\nSo that any action we take can be\nquestioned, cross referenced and validated\n\n216\n00:11:01.001 --> 00:11:05.015\nto be and the assumption will be,\nthat it can be proven to be legitimate.\n\n217\n00:11:05.015 --> 00:11:07.905\nAnd if we do that, we are then\nhandling evidence, gathering it,\n\n218\n00:11:07.905 --> 00:11:12.105\nanalyzing it, maintaining it through\na chain of custody in the appropriate way.\n\n219\n00:11:12.105 --> 00:11:15.295\nIf we act in a way that calls\nour activities into question.\n\n220\n00:11:15.295 --> 00:11:18.467\nIf we don't follow the rules of evidence,\nif we're not appropriately\n\n221\n00:11:18.467 --> 00:11:22.217\nacting in ways that would allow us\nto demonstrate that we've done so,\n\n222\n00:11:22.217 --> 00:11:26.607\nwe are not following the rules of\nour industry, of our profession.\n\n223\n00:11:26.607 --> 00:11:29.297\nWe are violating those rules,\nand we are not acting\n\n224\n00:11:29.297 --> 00:11:33.287\nin accordance with the rules of evidence\nand the forensic handling of data.\n\n225\n00:11:33.287 --> 00:11:34.767\nAnd we are not doing ourselves,\n\n226\n00:11:34.767 --> 00:11:37.457\ndoing anybody involved with\nthe investigation any good.\n\n227\n00:11:37.457 --> 00:11:40.880\nWe're actually creating a situation\nwhere evidence that is found,\n\n228\n00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.760\nit's gonna be thrown out.\n\n229\n00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.260\nIt's not gonna be admissible and\n\n230\n00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.270\nwe're actually doing harm\nas opposed to doing good.\n\n231\n00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.750\nAnd that is not what we want\nto do at any point in time.\n\n232\n00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:49.820\nSo just understand the logic of that.\n\n233\n00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:54.622\nEstimating potential impact of a malicious\nactivity and what that outcome may be.\n\n234\n00:11:54.622 --> 00:11:56.352\nAnd try to help investigators and\n\n235\n00:11:56.352 --> 00:12:00.365\npeople involved to understand the impact\nof the crime, is part of what we do or\n\n236\n00:12:00.365 --> 00:12:03.110\npotentially part of\nthe responsibilities we have.\n\n237\n00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.630\nWanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n238\n00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:08.380\nFinding vulnerabilities and security\nloopholes that may help attackers to\n\n239\n00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.460\nexecute on there, nefarious,\nor bad, or evil activities.\n\n240\n00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.968\nAlways good to think about that.\n\n241\n00:12:13.968 --> 00:12:17.130\nAnd a lot of times\nthe computer forensic thought\n\n242\n00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.644\nprocess is a little bit broader than\nperhaps we understand it to be.\n\n243\n00:12:21.644 --> 00:12:23.433\nAnd I talk to a lot of people about this,\n\n244\n00:12:23.433 --> 00:12:26.320\na lot of people that are engaged\nin forensic activity.\n\n245\n00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.360\nBut people are looking to get in to this\nindustry, looking to do this particular\n\n246\n00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.340\nset of things, or engage in these\nactivities, don't always understand that\n\n247\n00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:38.520\nit's not just about what happens after\nthe fact and investigation of that.\n\n248\n00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.470\nBut it's also the proactive\napproach to understanding and\n\n249\n00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.850\nidentifying vulnerabilities,\nwe would call weaknesses vulnerabilities.\n\n250\n00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.410\nThese terms are synonymous.\n\n251\n00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.849\nAnd that we have a proactive role to play,\nnot just a reactive role.\n\n252\n00:12:49.849 --> 00:12:54.518\nInstead of response, it is\na traditionally reactive environmental,\n\n253\n00:12:54.518 --> 00:12:56.634\nset of activities we engage in.\n\n254\n00:12:56.634 --> 00:13:00.876\nAnd computer forensics is going to fall\nunder the overarching thought process\n\n255\n00:13:00.876 --> 00:13:02.170\nof incident response.\n\n256\n00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:06.660\nThat's the massive container that we\nslip computer forensics up underneath.\n\n257\n00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.264\nAnd we engaged in those activities as\npart of incident response traditionally,\n\n258\n00:13:10.264 --> 00:13:11.940\na subset of them in other words.\n\n259\n00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:16.190\nSo people tend to think of us as being\nthose people that show up after the fact,\n\n260\n00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:20.220\nput up the hey caution crime\nscene tape and go do our thing.\n\n261\n00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.390\nAnd we never are there until something\nthat happens in other words.\n\n262\n00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:28.066\nThat is very true traditionally and\nthat is 99% of what we do.\n\n263\n00:13:28.066 --> 00:13:30.783\nBut there is this element of\nbeing able to be risk averse and\n\n264\n00:13:30.783 --> 00:13:33.675\nbe able to understand that we\ncan identify vulnerabilities.\n\n265\n00:13:33.675 --> 00:13:36.943\nManage risk in such a way\nthat we can offer guidance,\n\n266\n00:13:36.943 --> 00:13:41.034\nthat because of lessons learned\nthrough reactive activities and\n\n267\n00:13:41.034 --> 00:13:45.493\nengagement around the incident response,\nif we take that logically,\n\n268\n00:13:45.493 --> 00:13:49.270\nroll that forward, and\npresent that to the organization.\n\n269\n00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.580\nWe may be able to offer proactive\nguidance about what to do to\n\n270\n00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.870\nprevent this from either recurring or\nhappening in a different way,\n\n271\n00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.720\na variance,\nwhatever it may be going forward.\n\n272\n00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.840\nAnd we often misrepresent that or\n\n273\n00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.440\njust don't really make that clear as\npart of what computer forensics can do.\n\n274\n00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.450\nJust want to call that out to you,\nvery important.\n\n275\n00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.280\nUnderstanding techniques,\nmethodologies of the attackers.\n\n276\n00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.690\nAgain, relaying that knowledge\nforward becomes very important.\n\n277\n00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.850\nThings like honeypots and\nhoneynets, for instance,\n\n278\n00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:19.070\nwould be a good example of a tangible\nway that incident response and\n\n279\n00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:23.870\ncomputer forensics can be used to\nlearn from things that are going on.\n\n280\n00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:27.615\nAnd then pay that forward to create\na different response pattern,\n\n281\n00:14:27.615 --> 00:14:31.275\na different capability, and\ntherefore, different security stance.\n\n282\n00:14:31.275 --> 00:14:33.825\nModifying the enterprise\nsecurity architecture\n\n283\n00:14:33.825 --> 00:14:36.555\nwould be the outcome of this if\nit was done the correct way.\n\n284\n00:14:36.555 --> 00:14:42.717\nAnd allowing us as a result to decide that\nwe will make changes because of that.\n\n285\n00:14:42.717 --> 00:14:46.941\nPotentially cut off an avenue of ingress,\nan avenue for attack to come in.\n\n286\n00:14:46.941 --> 00:14:50.395\nAnd this is also sometimes\ncommonly referred to as ASR,\n\n287\n00:14:50.395 --> 00:14:54.740\nAttack Surface Reduction or ASLR,\nAttack Surface Level Reduction.\n\n288\n00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:58.746\nWhere we're trying to reduce the footprint\nof the vulnerabilities in systems and\n\n289\n00:14:58.746 --> 00:15:02.360\ntherefore, reduce the number of\nattack vectors that may be available.\n\n290\n00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.610\nThat a bad actor or\nthreat actor may be able to take on.\n\n291\n00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.420\nSo these are some thoughts about things\nthat objectives of computer forensics may\n\n292\n00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.130\nallow us to engage around.\n\n293\n00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.600\nRecover deletion or recover deleted files,\n\n294\n00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.110\ndeleted information, hidden files\nthings like steghide graphically.\n\n295\n00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:19.010\nModified files for instance.\n\n296\n00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.895\nTemporary data in caches and registers.\n\n297\n00:15:21.895 --> 00:15:26.308\nAll that kind of stuff that we call\nvolatile data in terms of the kind of data\n\n298\n00:15:26.308 --> 00:15:28.980\nthat we look at would be earmarked for\nthat.\n\n299\n00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.607\nAlso performing incidence responses,\n\n300\n00:15:30.607 --> 00:15:33.680\nI mentioned would be one of those key\ncriteria's that we focused on as well.\n\n301\n00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.980\nThere are different types of data\nthat we examine and look at.\n\n302\n00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.538\nThere is nonvolatile data and\n\n303\n00:15:38.538 --> 00:15:42.510\nvolatile data when we think about\nthe types of data that we examine.\n\n304\n00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:47.090\nYou may also see a third type sometimes\nreferenced remnant or residual data.\n\n305\n00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:51.538\nThat is a category, but\nyou could say it's traditionally part of,\n\n306\n00:15:51.538 --> 00:15:53.732\npotentially the volatile data.\n\n307\n00:15:53.732 --> 00:15:56.924\nBecause oftentimes that's data that\nis left in places where it may\n\n308\n00:15:56.924 --> 00:15:58.924\nnot be there where we shut the system off.\n\n309\n00:15:58.924 --> 00:16:03.554\nYou also see it in the static data or\nthe data that is nonvolatile, because\n\n310\n00:16:03.554 --> 00:16:08.404\nAgain if we erase a hard drive in theory,\nformatting it to block access to data\n\n311\n00:16:08.404 --> 00:16:13.060\nthere may still be remnant or residual\ndata that is left on the hard drive.\n\n312\n00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.590\nAnd that is something that will be static,\nit would be there if\n\n313\n00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:19.260\nyou power on power off cycles but we have\nto have special tools to go find it.\n\n314\n00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.310\nWhether its the DD Tool in Linux which\nwould allow us to create a drive image and\n\n315\n00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:24.390\nthen look for that.\n\n316\n00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.940\nWhether it is some sort of drive\nimaging tool that we use in Windows,\n\n317\n00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.710\nor any combination of those things,\nwouldn't really matter.\n\n318\n00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:34.220\nBut creating a bit-by-bit drive\nimage would allow us to then\n\n319\n00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.800\nexamine the sectors of the drive,\nlooking for remnant data and finding it.\n\n320\n00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.136\nSo there's multiple types of data that we\nmay work with and want to be aware of.\n\n321\n00:16:41.136 --> 00:16:45.275\nAnd volatile data, while it is\nequally important or as important as\n\n322\n00:16:45.275 --> 00:16:49.996\nnon-volatile data, equally important and\nas important as residual data,\n\n323\n00:16:49.996 --> 00:16:54.011\nit is the most perishable,\nthe most fragile, of the data types.\n\n324\n00:16:54.011 --> 00:16:58.840\nCuz if we power down the system or in\nanyway modify the configuration of certain\n\n325\n00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.497\nareas of the system,\nwe may erase of irreparably damage and\n\n326\n00:17:02.497 --> 00:17:06.550\nremove that volatile data and\nthat can be a bit of a concern for us.\n\n327\n00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:07.780\nSo one example,\n\n328\n00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:12.040\nif you give me one second just to get\nto a command prompt and bring this up.\n\n329\n00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.410\nIf you wanna take a look here real\nquick we're in a Windows 10 machine.\n\n330\n00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:16.960\nJust to give you a quick example\nof what I'm talking about,\n\n331\n00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.630\nwe've talked about volatile and\nperishable data.\n\n332\n00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:21.790\nThere is lots of different data\nthat we could look at, for\n\n333\n00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.730\ninstance we may look at netstat and\n\n334\n00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:29.880\nthe netstat tool, network statistics has\na bunch of switches associated with it.\n\n335\n00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:35.955\nIf we use the netstat -a switch we will\nsee the state of open port connections for\n\n336\n00:17:35.955 --> 00:17:38.414\nboth TCP and UDP on the adapter.\n\n337\n00:17:38.414 --> 00:17:42.159\nWhatever adapter or adapters, if I have\nmore than one I would specify the adapter\n\n338\n00:17:42.159 --> 00:17:46.240\nin question, are available, and the\ninbound connections and the state of them.\n\n339\n00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.870\nNow this data is volatile,\nit's perishable.\n\n340\n00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:53.060\nIf I power off the system this data goes\naway and I would not be able to see it.\n\n341\n00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.670\nThis would be stuff that\nas a forensic investigator,\n\n342\n00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.870\nI would have to gather from the system.\n\n343\n00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:02.300\nWhether its Windows based,\nan Apple based system, Linux unit based.\n\n344\n00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:06.630\nThis is a protocol stack,\na networking stack tool and function.\n\n345\n00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:11.300\nThis is going to approximately work\nthe same way regardless of OS that we use.\n\n346\n00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.720\nAnd the network statistics information\nshould be gathered as part of\n\n347\n00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.130\nthe gathering of volatile data,\nregardless of the system that we're on.\n\n348\n00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:19.420\nSo wanna think about that.\n\n349\n00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:24.710\nFor instance, we may look at NBT stat.\n\n350\n00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:29.290\nAnother tool that will\nallow us to see information\n\n351\n00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:33.370\nin the name resolution cache of the\nsystem, in this case a Windows machine.\n\n352\n00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.890\nThis one would be specific\nto a Windows machine.\n\n353\n00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:39.510\nWe don't use net BIOS traditionally on\nother systems, so we would see it there.\n\n354\n00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:44.440\nBut those two entries,\nSVR 12 right here and VM host right here,\n\n355\n00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:49.530\nand the IP addresses associated with them,\nthat is information that is going to be,\n\n356\n00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:50.500\nagain, volatile.\n\n357\n00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.010\nIt'll be there for a period of time.\n\n358\n00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:55.910\nYou could see life for seconds there\nbetween the right-hand column, the TTL,\n\n359\n00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:56.870\ntill we tick down to 0,\n\n360\n00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.300\nwhere that information is removed\nfrom the cache by the system.\n\n361\n00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:04.270\nDepending on when I interrogate this\nsystem, as I come across it during\n\n362\n00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:08.200\nthe commission of an investigation, I may\nor may not find anything in that cache.\n\n363\n00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.930\nBut if I found something, I would have\nto capture it and understand what it is.\n\n364\n00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:16.190\nBecause that will eventually, within\nfive to six minutes, maybe ten minutes,\n\n365\n00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:17.720\ndepending on what it is.\n\n366\n00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.250\nJust under ten minutes now,\nthat would disappear.\n\n367\n00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.910\nIf I didn't do anything with it,\ndidn't use it within ten minutes,\n\n368\n00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.890\nthat information would essentially\njust evaporate, it would be gone.\n\n369\n00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:28.700\nWe would have to be aware of that and\nknow that as well, right?\n\n370\n00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.840\nSo there's different\nways we can look at this.\n\n371\n00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.850\nWe could look at IP\nconfiguration information.\n\n372\n00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:38.846\nWhich is static on a machine and\nthat's gonna be there regardless.\n\n373\n00:19:38.846 --> 00:19:41.440\nAnd we can use IP config\nto see basic information,\n\n374\n00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.780\nwe can use the all switch to extend\nthat and see more information.\n\n375\n00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:51.360\nBut if, instead, we want to take a look at\nwhat is in the DNS resolver cache, again,\n\n376\n00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.380\nwe would get information that is volatile,\nthat will be there for a period of time.\n\n377\n00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.060\nBut that would be removed if\nI powered-down the system or\n\n378\n00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.810\nif I flushed the cache, or\nany combination of those things.\n\n379\n00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.400\nSo we'd want to capture that information.\n\n380\n00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:07.830\nThese are 3 or 4 different examples of\ninformation that would be considered to be\n\n381\n00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:12.130\nvolatile, that would be considered to be\ninformation that would have to be captured\n\n382\n00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:16.840\nduring the current present state of\nthe system to be acceptable, usable, and\n\n383\n00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.990\nreferencable during an investigation.\n\n384\n00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:24.204\nIf I look at something like\nthe routing table and I did a, whoops.\n\n385\n00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:32.310\nI did the route command and\nI did something like route print, right?\n\n386\n00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:36.340\nAnd I went in and\nI looked at the routing table.\n\n387\n00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.530\nI would see, for the most part,\n\n388\n00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:40.970\nstatic information that is in\nthe routing table on the local machine.\n\n389\n00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:45.510\nAnd I wouldn't necessarily, both for\nIPv6 and IPv4, wouldn't necessarily\n\n390\n00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:49.570\nhave to worry about capturing that with\nthe machine powered on, although we'd\n\n391\n00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:53.500\nprobably want a record of it, just to have\nit, because this information is static.\n\n392\n00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.320\nIt's probably not gonna change\nwhen I power off the machine and\n\n393\n00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.380\npower it back on, because those are static\nentries that are not gonna go away.\n\n394\n00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:03.800\nSo it depends on the nature of\nthe data that I'm looking at.\n\n395\n00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.300\nBut a forensic investigator would have\nto have all of this running around in\n\n396\n00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:07.870\ntheir head and\n\n397\n00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.790\nhave the knowledge of where we find\nthis data, the knowledge of the tools.\n\n398\n00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:15.150\nAnd all I did was use three or four\ndifferent commands that were available\n\n399\n00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:18.310\nto anybody who knows about networking and\nhow networking and\n\n400\n00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.710\nthe tools associated with it in\nan operating system would function.\n\n401\n00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.100\nYou may not be familiar with those tools,\nand if you're not, definitely encourage\n\n402\n00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.290\nyou to look at the help file in any one\nof the tools we just demonstrated and\n\n403\n00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:29.450\nread up a little bit about them.\n\n404\n00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.080\nAnd make sure you are familiar with them.\n\n405\n00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.850\nMaybe go back and\nlook at some of the network plus content\n\n406\n00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:38.410\nthat we have in the ITProTV library where\nwould examine these tools in more depth.\n\n407\n00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.460\nAnd I'm sure there's going to be\na lot of great content out there.\n\n408\n00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.900\nAny of the Cisco content as well.\n\n409\n00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.680\nProbably the entry level CCNA\ncontent would go through\n\n410\n00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.390\na lot of these tools in great detail.\n\n411\n00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:50.380\nSo there's a lot of places you could\nfigure out how to latch onto and\n\n412\n00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.350\nget some additional depth on\nthe information we're just\n\n413\n00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:55.980\nreally throwing out here as an example for\nyou.\n\n414\n00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.740\nBut regardless of where you find out\nabout it, regardless of what you do or\n\n415\n00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.590\ndon't know, and how you educate yourself,\nbecause that is important.\n\n416\n00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:03.770\nBut regardless,\n\n417\n00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:08.310\nthe forensic investigator would have to\nbring to bear knowledge of these tools and\n\n418\n00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:12.700\nknowledge of the volatility, and the the\norder of volatilities, we've talked about\n\n419\n00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.650\nof data to be able to manage and interact\nwith this data in a meaningful way.\n\n420\n00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:19.230\nNow, could we just simply\ndo what I just did here.\n\n421\n00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.280\nAnd let's just take this one step further.\n\n422\n00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.470\nJust go down here to a command\nprompt where we can see everything.\n\n423\n00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.420\nLet me just clear this screen out here for\none second,\n\n424\n00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.190\nmake it a little bit easier for\nus to work with.\n\n425\n00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.040\nAnd let's say that we did.\n\n426\n00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.830\nLet me just bring this up one more time.\n\n427\n00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.430\nLet's go back through\nour commands right here.\n\n428\n00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:38.640\nAnd let's do our ipconfig\ndisplay DNS one more time.\n\n429\n00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.780\nLet's say that I wanna capture\nthat information volatile\n\n430\n00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:45.330\ninformation in the resolver cache,\nthe DNS resolver cache.\n\n431\n00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.456\nI wanna capture that,\nnow there're several ways to do this.\n\n432\n00:22:48.456 --> 00:22:51.250\nI could, cuz it's so large,\nit's scrolling through,\n\n433\n00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.790\nI couldn't just screen capture it,\ncuz there's too much data there.\n\n434\n00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.270\nI could output that to\na file of some kind, right?\n\n435\n00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.270\nSo I could do something like this.\n\n436\n00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.500\nPipe, or cat, or out that to a file.\n\n437\n00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:11.345\nSo maybe I could do something like And\n\n438\n00:23:11.345 --> 00:23:17.590\nthen dnscache.txt, right?\n\n439\n00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:20.970\nAnd I don't have a directory\ncalled catch me, so I'm just gonna\n\n440\n00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:25.920\ngo create one really quickly, so just bear\nwith me here once second while I do that.\n\n441\n00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.690\nWhere is this PC?\n\n442\n00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:32.439\nAnd, so if I go in here,\n\n443\n00:23:32.439 --> 00:23:37.128\nand I want to just go in and do.\n\n444\n00:23:37.128 --> 00:23:39.073\nI'm gonna call that Catch me, right?\n\n445\n00:23:42.015 --> 00:23:45.202\nAll right, so\nif I did something like that, and\n\n446\n00:23:45.202 --> 00:23:50.020\nI do that, I would be able to\ncatch that data literally, right?\n\n447\n00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:54.207\nIn the Catch me folder and I have it\nright there, you can see dnscache.txt and\n\n448\n00:23:54.207 --> 00:23:56.601\nyou could open that up and\nI got everything.\n\n449\n00:23:56.601 --> 00:24:00.697\nSo that's, in theory, all you need to\ndo but here is the problem with that,\n\n450\n00:24:00.697 --> 00:24:04.857\nI just modified the hard drive, the C\ndrive specifically by adding a file to it\n\n451\n00:24:04.857 --> 00:24:07.293\nwhile I was trying to\ncapture volatile data.\n\n452\n00:24:07.293 --> 00:24:10.702\nNow from a forensic standpoint,\na rule of evidence standpoint, and\n\n453\n00:24:10.702 --> 00:24:13.527\na forensic investigation and\nmethodology standpoint,\n\n454\n00:24:13.527 --> 00:24:16.250\nI just made the biggest\nmistake I could possibly make.\n\n455\n00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.797\nI might as well stop at this point,\nthrow down the mic, we should go home.\n\n456\n00:24:19.797 --> 00:24:20.630\nLet's go grab lunch because we're done.\n\n457\n00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.500\nAnd that's it, because I screwed up.\n\n458\n00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.870\nI screwed up big time.\n\n459\n00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:28.910\nAnd what I did was I modified\nthe integrity of the hard drive and\n\n460\n00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.840\nthe state of the hard drive,\nby adding this file to it,\n\n461\n00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.760\nwhile I'm supposed to be investigating it.\n\n462\n00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.985\nAnd the number one rule is,\n\n463\n00:24:34.985 --> 00:24:38.092\nyou don't modify the hard drive\nwhen you're trying to gather data.\n\n464\n00:24:38.092 --> 00:24:40.640\nAnd what I would have to\ndo is gather that data.\n\n465\n00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.480\nBut instead of outputting it to\nthe C drive, I'd have to output it\n\n466\n00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.090\nto an external drive that uses\nsomething called a right blocker.\n\n467\n00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:51.290\nA tool that would prevent write back,\nprevent the adding, modifying, or\n\n468\n00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:55.190\nin any way, changing add, remove,\nmodify, delete, anything.\n\n469\n00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:57.970\nAny kind of information\non the source drive.\n\n470\n00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:01.190\nSo I'd have to take this\ninformation off to a thumb drive,\n\n471\n00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:02.950\nsomething like that whatever it would be.\n\n472\n00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:07.586\nAnd they'd have to do that in what\nwe'd say is a forensically sound way\n\n473\n00:25:07.586 --> 00:25:11.451\nin order to capture this\ninformation have it be accurate.\n\n474\n00:25:11.451 --> 00:25:15.742\nMake sure we have integrity associated\nwith it in that it would be acceptable but\n\n475\n00:25:15.742 --> 00:25:19.590\nto validate that I did it in a way\nthat doesn't modify the source.\n\n476\n00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:22.590\nBecause then I call into question\nthe validity of all the other data,\n\n477\n00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:26.410\nall the other evidence that I find on\nthat hard drive while I'm examining it.\n\n478\n00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:30.390\nNone of it, in other words, would be\nthen admissible potentially as evidence.\n\n479\n00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:33.770\nSo I violate the rule by\nwriting it to the local drive.\n\n480\n00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:37.460\nI have to make sure I put it\noff the system in such a way\n\n481\n00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:42.430\nthat I don't allow it to actually interact\nwith or in any way modify, right?\n\n482\n00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:43.690\nWhat I'm doing locally.\n\n483\n00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:48.330\nAnd so write blockers are one of the tools\nthat are in the investigative tool kit.\n\n484\n00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:53.610\nA piece of hardware that will allow us to\nexfiltrate to, exit data out of the system\n\n485\n00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:58.580\nin a one way path without infiltrating,\nwithout putting data back into the system.\n\n486\n00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:02.500\nWriting files to the hard drive\nmodifies the hard drive registers,\n\n487\n00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.670\nmodifies the information about\nwhen files were accessed,\n\n488\n00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:09.940\nwhen they were created, moves bits of data\naround on the hard drive platter itself.\n\n489\n00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.160\nWe'll talk about all this\nstuff on upcoming episodes.\n\n490\n00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.280\nAnd modifies the file map overall.\n\n491\n00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.930\nAnd as a result, could potentially\noverwrite volatile data that's remnant\n\n492\n00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.400\ndata that's sitting on the hard\ndrive that may have been evidence.\n\n493\n00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.893\nI may have just overwritten a file that\nI was actually looking to investigate in\n\n494\n00:26:22.893 --> 00:26:23.475\nthe first place.\n\n495\n00:26:23.475 --> 00:26:24.740\n&gt;&gt; That would be bad.\n\n496\n00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.258\n&gt;&gt; That would not be good.\n\n497\n00:26:26.258 --> 00:26:27.720\nWe could say that would be bad.\n\n498\n00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.840\nThat would be accurate.\n\n499\n00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:33.630\nRight, so just a quick demonstration for\nyou as to all the things\n\n500\n00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:36.510\nthat have been churning around in\nyour head while you start to do this.\n\n501\n00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:39.082\nYou gotta be juggling all\nthese balls in the air,\n\n502\n00:26:39.082 --> 00:26:42.722\nkeeping track of where evidence is,\nfiguring out how to capture it so\n\n503\n00:26:42.722 --> 00:26:46.800\nthat it doesn't disappear, but\ndoing so in a forensically sound way.\n\n504\n00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.500\nThis is tough work, this is not easy.\n\n505\n00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.350\nPeople thing, they see this on TV,\nit's cool, it's sexy.\n\n506\n00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:55.495\nI'm gonna wear the cool shades, drive\na cool car, carry a gun and shoot people.\n\n507\n00:26:55.495 --> 00:26:57.146\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't work that way, at least,\n\n508\n00:26:57.146 --> 00:26:59.631\nyou're not supposed to,\nanyway, it's not good, right?\n\n509\n00:26:59.631 --> 00:27:01.040\nNow, it doesn't work that way, right?\n\n510\n00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.670\nThis is incredible exciting and\ninteresting work, but\n\n511\n00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.140\nit's also very intensive.\n\n512\n00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.450\nYou gotta really be able to keep a lot\nof things straight in your head.\n\n513\n00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:12.820\nYou gotta understand methodology,\nyou have to be detail-oriented.\n\n514\n00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.730\nAnd you have to be that kind\nof person that is patient and\n\n515\n00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:17.290\nwiling to follow the rules.\n\n516\n00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:20.620\nIf that's not you, not that I'm saying\nthat you shouldn't stick around.\n\n517\n00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.730\nShouldn't engage through these lessons,\nor that shouldn't spend time with us.\n\n518\n00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:26.970\nLove to have you go through this\nmaterial with us, but understand.\n\n519\n00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:31.082\nIf you struggle with the ability to work\ninside a box and be constrained by rules,\n\n520\n00:27:31.082 --> 00:27:34.080\nand are that kind of person that\njust does not like structure?\n\n521\n00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.025\nThis may not be a career path for you.\n\n522\n00:27:36.025 --> 00:27:37.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This may not be the best choice for\n\n523\n00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:40.800\nyou, you're probably\nwell-suited to be a hacker.\n\n524\n00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.430\nYou may not be well-suited to\nbe an investigator, right?\n\n525\n00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:47.810\nSo you may wanna think about defensive,\noffensive security things like that, but\n\n526\n00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:48.920\nmaybe investigative and\n\n527\n00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:53.060\nincident response security perspectives\nmay not be the perfect solution for you.\n\n528\n00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.430\nThat doesn't mean you\ncan't learn to do it.\n\n529\n00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:57.000\nIt just means that you may not\nhave the temperament, right?\n\n530\n00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.450\nThe personality that will let you do this\nprofessionally, to be happy doing it.\n\n531\n00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:01.950\nThat's all I'm suggesting to you.\n\n532\n00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:03.430\nSo just keep that in\nmind as we get started.\n\n533\n00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:04.920\nLots more to come certainly.\n\n534\n00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.710\nLots of things we have\nto be talking about.\n\n535\n00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:10.240\nA lot of stuff involved with just\nour overview conversation about\n\n536\n00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.040\nthe traditional state of\nforensics in the world today.\n\n537\n00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.630\nWe're gonna continue those\nconversations in upcoming episodes, but\n\n538\n00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.210\nbefore we do that,\nDaniel has to say something to you.\n\n539\n00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:21.270\n&gt;&gt; Yes I do, I have to say looks like\nwe're gonna have to go into Part 2,\n\n540\n00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.800\nbecause we are well out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n541\n00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.480\n&gt;&gt; We are not.\nWe have like a minute left.\n\n542\n00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.146\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n543\n00:28:26.146 --> 00:28:27.106\n&gt;&gt; You make it sound like I rambled.\n\n544\n00:28:27.106 --> 00:28:29.317\n&gt;&gt; Adam's like I can get six bullet points\ndone in that whole minute, don't time me.\n\n545\n00:28:29.317 --> 00:28:31.876\n&gt;&gt; I could teach like another five\nminutes of stuff in a minute.\n\n546\n00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:34.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] He probably could ladies and\ngentlemen, he's that good.\n\n547\n00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:35.920\nBut Adam, you're right.\n\n548\n00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.549\nI like how you talked\nabout the temperaments\n\n549\n00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.720\nof what it takes to be\nforensics investigator.\n\n550\n00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.900\nIt is about going down a checklist.\n\n551\n00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.710\nDo not get ahead of yourself.\n\n552\n00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.381\nDo not skirt outside of the rules.\n\n553\n00:28:47.381 --> 00:28:51.937\nBecause as soon as you do, you might now\nhave just completely blown up the entire\n\n554\n00:28:51.937 --> 00:28:56.365\ninvestigative process and now maybe\nthat evidence is no longer admissible.\n\n555\n00:28:56.365 --> 00:28:59.585\nAnd you're the guy that made that happen\nor you're the girl that made that happen,\n\n556\n00:28:59.585 --> 00:29:01.230\nso it's all about sticking to the rules.\n\n557\n00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:04.620\nIf that's not your mindset\neither get that way or\n\n558\n00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.991\nmaybe penetration testing is for\nyou, right?\n\n559\n00:29:06.991 --> 00:29:09.760\n[LAUGH] And look at that kind of stuff.\n\n560\n00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:13.320\nOther than that, Adam, you're right, we\nhave plenty more to talk about in upcoming\n\n561\n00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:18.270\nepisodes, but like I said, this episode,\nthe well has run dry for time, that is.\n\n562\n00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:21.590\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nITProTV, I've been your host,\n\n563\n00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:22.550\nDaniel Lowery.\n\n564\n00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:23.123\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n565\n00:29:23.123 --> 00:29:25.535\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n566\n00:29:25.535 --> 00:29:31.191\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n567\n00:29:31.191 --> 00:29:34.639\nThank you for watching IT Pro TV.\n\n",

on\n\n3\n00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:12.593\nITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.593 --> 00:00:15.346\nNow if you haven't heard of FirePower,\nit's a pretty exciting product,\n\n5\n00:00:15.346 --> 00:00:16.494\none that we're jazzed about.\n\n6\n00:00:16.494 --> 00:00:20.332\nAnd I know I'm especially excited because\nwe have a special guest in the studio\n\n7\n00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:21.620\nto help us with this show.\n\n8\n00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:28.165\nWe've got consultant, author, all around\nknowledgeable Cisco guy Mr. Todd Lanlier.\n\n9\n00:00:28.165 --> 00:00:33.070\nHe's celebrating the release of his new\nbook on Cisco Sourcefire/Firepower with\n\n10\n00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.111\nAdvanced Firesight Management.\n\n11\n00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:38.308\nIt's quite the mouthful, but\nit is quite a good read.\n\n12\n00:00:38.308 --> 00:00:40.269\nWe've got Todd Lanlier here in the studio,\nI know I'm excited.\n\n13\n00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:41.825\nTodd thank you for being with us.\n\n14\n00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:43.868\n>> Fantastic, great to be here.\n\n15\n00:00:43.868 --> 00:00:47.888\nWe have the most exciting product that\nCisco's released in years, right.\n\n16\n00:00:47.888 --> 00:00:51.278\nSo Cisco bought SourceFire\na couple years ago.\n\n17\n00:00:51.278 --> 00:00:54.901\nAnd lots of money,\nthey invest lots of money.\n\n18\n00:00:54.901 --> 00:01:01.671\nAnd we're gonna see this product in pretty\nmuch their whole range from routers.\n\n19\n00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:03.528\nWe certainly,\nthey have them on their ASA's now.\n\n20\n00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:05.664\nAnd that's where I work mostly with them.\n\n21\n00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:06.825\nBut they also have the appliances.\n\n22\n00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:09.798\nBut we're gonna see this, they're gonna\npretty much push this out on all parts.\n\n23\n00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:12.746\nBecause this is such\na phenomenal security product.\n\n24\n00:01:12.746 --> 00:01:16.322\n[COUGH] I wanna say right now\nthat I get excited about it.\n\n25\n00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:18.500\nI wanna make sure you understand\nI don't work for Cisco.\n\n26\n00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.260\nI don't speak for Cisco.\n\n27\n00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.453\nAnd they are not paying me.\n\n28\n00:01:20.453 --> 00:01:21.196\nBoy, I wish they were.\n\n29\n00:01:21.196 --> 00:01:23.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] But they are not.\n\n30\n00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.580\nSo I get excited about it.\n\n31\n00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.410\nI do a lot of consulting.\n\n32\n00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.210\nI do a lot of training with it.\n\n33\n00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.404\nI've got other consulting jobs.\n\n34\n00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:32.340\nBut on the security front, this is the\nmost exciting product I've seen in years.\n\n35\n00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.832\nAnd it works phenomenally.\n\n36\n00:01:33.832 --> 00:01:35.737\nReally what it is, it's snort, right.\n\n37\n00:01:35.737 --> 00:01:39.875\nSo we've got the power of snort\nwith the intuitive gooey on top.\n\n38\n00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:41.315\nWhy don't we go ahead and\ntake a look at that.\n\n39\n00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:44.287\nAnd I'll show you some of the power\nof what we're going to go\n\n40\n00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:45.721\nthrough in our series here.\n\n41\n00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:49.638\nSo nonetheless, here we are looking at\nsomething called FireSIGHT management\n\n42\n00:01:49.638 --> 00:01:52.215\ncenter, or\nalso referred to as the defense center.\n\n43\n00:01:52.215 --> 00:01:54.258\nAnd I refer to it a lot\nas on old school guy.\n\n44\n00:01:54.258 --> 00:01:58.761\nBut the fact is, is we're looking at here\nand this isn't really a great screen.\n\n45\n00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:00.810\nYou don't really wanna\nsee this screen at work.\n\n46\n00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.240\nBecause this is a lot\nof attacks occurring.\n\n47\n00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.330\nSo this is a demo, and\nbasically it's saying.\n\n48\n00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.100\nHey, we're attacking this constantly.\n\n49\n00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.330\nThose red lines are my attacks,\nlose my data.\n\n50\n00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.330\nIt more looked like, let me show you\na real network that I'm working on here.\n\n51\n00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.772\nIt more looked like something like this.\n\n52\n00:02:15.772 --> 00:02:20.088\nAttacks, we don't have very many and\nare ideas are something like this.\n\n53\n00:02:20.088 --> 00:02:22.439\nIn this case here because\nwe're doing a demo.\n\n54\n00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:23.531\nWe want to see a lot of attacks.\n\n55\n00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:26.180\nSo we can play with it and\nsee what's going on.\n\n56\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.990\nIn this case here,\nI'm gonna come down here.\n\n57\n00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.900\nAnd I say, look I'm seeing malware.\n\n58\n00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.669\nAnd do you think malware\nis important today, Don?\n\n59\n00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.548\n>> I don't think so, Tom,\nI mean I'm on a Mac, right.\n\n60\n00:02:35.548 --> 00:02:36.593\nSo I don't have malware problems, do I?\n\n61\n00:02:36.593 --> 00:02:38.520\n>> No, I don't think so.\n\n62\n00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.075\nBut I did see you put in\nyour credit card earlier.\n\n63\n00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:41.353\nSo you can get your files back.\n\n64\n00:02:41.353 --> 00:02:46.312\n>> Absolutely, it said I was encrypted,\nI didn't want that, right?\n\n65\n00:02:46.312 --> 00:02:47.636\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, but\n\n66\n00:02:47.636 --> 00:02:50.790\ndon't you think you\nshould've called the FBI?\n\n67\n00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.473\n>> Our taxpayer dollars do go to them\nto help us out of situations like that.\n\n68\n00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:57.585\nAre you hinting at the fact\nthat they don't do that?\n\n69\n00:02:57.585 --> 00:02:59.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well I don't know.\n\n70\n00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.313\nI saw something on the news the other day,\nand I was like.\n\n71\n00:03:03.313 --> 00:03:05.730\nWell, I find this fascinating.\n\n72\n00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.800\nSo let's go ahead and take a look at\nwhat the FBI thinks about malware.\n\n73\n00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.420\nAnd what comes in malware?\n\n74\n00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.621\nSomething called ransomware.\n\n75\n00:03:12.621 --> 00:03:14.455\nThis is just a piece of it, isn't it?\n\n76\n00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:16.972\nAnd in this ransomware,\nwhat is the FBI saying here?\n\n77\n00:03:16.972 --> 00:03:19.549\nThe FBI says,\nwell if you read through the article.\n\n78\n00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.477\nThey say,\nwell if everyone just pays the ransom.\n\n79\n00:03:21.477 --> 00:03:24.710\nThe prices are coming down because so\nmany people are paying it.\n\n80\n00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.400\nAnd it's easier than trying to pay,\nit's less expensive than sending it out to\n\n81\n00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.600\na repair shop to try to\nget your files back.\n\n82\n00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.080\nSo he just paid his $89.95 and\nhe got his files unlocked.\n\n83\n00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.049\nWe're sitting here, so\nis malware important?\n\n84\n00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:37.699\nSure it is.\n\n85\n00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:40.207\nBecause if this happened\nto you in your corporation.\n\n86\n00:03:40.207 --> 00:03:43.055\nThey could be charging hundreds\nof thousands of dollars.\n\n87\n00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:44.290\n>> And just think about,\n\n88\n00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.010\nit was just a few months ago that\nSony Pictures got involved in this.\n\n89\n00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.750\nWhere all of their\nmachines got locked down.\n\n90\n00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.556\nThe whole company, the motion picture side\nof it was basically out of business for\n\n91\n00:03:54.556 --> 00:03:56.836\nweeks before they managed\nto recover from that.\n\n92\n00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.414\nImagine that happening to your company,\nand\n\n93\n00:03:58.414 --> 00:04:00.458\nthe amount of money you would\nlose by having that offline.\n\n94\n00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:02.368\n>> Yeah.\n>> Wouldn't it be nice if we could stop\n\n95\n00:04:02.368 --> 00:04:03.685\nthat before it even happened?\n\n96\n00:04:03.685 --> 00:04:08.653\n>> And that's just a feature of this,\nand it's the best product for\n\n97\n00:04:08.653 --> 00:04:10.379\nmalware in the world.\n\n98\n00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.049\nSo viruses and\ntrojans certainly might be a problem.\n\n99\n00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.370\nBut they're nothing compared\nto what malware can give us.\n\n100\n00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.490\nAnd malware comes in very small packages.\n\n101\n00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.080\nAnd, so, I mean, they can be on apps.\n\n102\n00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.820\nThey're very, very small.\n\n103\n00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.403\nI've seen some really small ones\nthat I was looking at the other day.\n\n104\n00:04:22.403 --> 00:04:25.979\nBut nonetheless, so we can come here and\nwe can see malware.\n\n105\n00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.335\nLet me go right to a screen\nthat shows some malware.\n\n106\n00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:32.124\nWhere did I put it?\nRight here.\n\n107\n00:04:32.124 --> 00:04:33.447\nAnd this is showing on this demo.\n\n108\n00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:36.466\n[LAUGH] And, again, if your work looks\nlike this you guys got a problem.\n\n109\n00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:41.920\nBut nonetheless, I can come in here and\nsay here's my malware.\n\n110\n00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.670\nAnd again we're determining the file\ndisposition through this product\n\n111\n00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.580\nby sending something called an AMP cloud,\n\n112\n00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.230\nAdvanced Malware Protection\ncloud at CISCO.\n\n113\n00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.152\nAnd they basically gave us a file\ndisposition and they came back and\n\n114\n00:04:52.152 --> 00:04:52.731\nsaid, hey.\n\n115\n00:04:52.731 --> 00:04:53.939\nThis is bad, right.\n\n116\n00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:57.120\nAnd they're telling us this file\ncame back with a high fret score.\n\n117\n00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.153\nSo go ahead and click on this,\nand now when we see this file and\n\n118\n00:05:00.153 --> 00:05:03.319\nwhat this product will give us\nis what's called a trajectory.\n\n119\n00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.431\nIn other words when it got into\nyour network, where did it go?\n\n120\n00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:07.894\nSo I mean,\nthis is just one of the features.\n\n121\n00:05:07.894 --> 00:05:12.453\nI'm just scratching the surface on what\nwe're gonna cover in our episodes.\n\n122\n00:05:12.453 --> 00:05:16.842\nAnd this is gonna show me where it's gone,\nwho it talked to.\n\n123\n00:05:16.842 --> 00:05:22.670\nAnd the things it gives me is I'm\nnot gonna go through that right now.\n\n124\n00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.025\nBut I'll do this in the episodes.\n\n125\n00:05:24.025 --> 00:05:27.313\nAnd the fact is,\nwe'll look at the thread score and\n\n126\n00:05:27.313 --> 00:05:31.321\nthe report on it that came from\nwhat's called Talos sandbox.\n\n127\n00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:33.390\nNonetheless, I can also download the file,\nright.\n\n128\n00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.423\nSo we can use it in our own sandbox and\nso on, and stuff like that.\n\n129\n00:05:36.423 --> 00:05:38.813\nBut let's go back here to\ngive more of a big picture.\n\n130\n00:05:38.813 --> 00:05:42.400\nBut the idea was this,\nmalware's a serious issue.\n\n131\n00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.100\nThis is a very serious product.\n\n132\n00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.430\nAnd can other companies do a lot of this?\n\n133\n00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.680\nThe other companies can.\n\n134\n00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.304\nAnd, again, I'm not gonna pick on other\ncompanies like, you got Palo Alto and\n\n135\n00:05:53.304 --> 00:05:56.766\nMcAfee and a lot of people use\nthese in their fine products.\n\n136\n00:05:56.766 --> 00:05:59.807\nThat's not what makes\nthis one sing above them.\n\n137\n00:05:59.807 --> 00:06:03.462\nWhat makes them, this product sing\nabove your other products and\n\n138\n00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:06.461\nI'll pick on Palo Alto in this case,\npoor Palo Alto.\n\n139\n00:06:06.461 --> 00:06:08.643\nBecause I go out to a lot\nof companies that are like.\n\n140\n00:06:08.643 --> 00:06:10.153\nWhy should I buy this over Palo Alto?\n\n141\n00:06:10.153 --> 00:06:12.340\nCuz that's what about we're about to buy.\n\n142\n00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.134\nAnd I'll show them why, because you've\ngot like at least nine administrative\n\n143\n00:06:16.134 --> 00:06:19.543\ninterfaces with Palo Alto doing\nthe same thing that we're doing here.\n\n144\n00:06:19.543 --> 00:06:20.913\nAnd it can't do it quite as well.\n\n145\n00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:24.117\nNot only that, you don't have\nany correlation between events.\n\n146\n00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:26.253\nSo now we have this single interface.\n\n147\n00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:31.447\nThis phenomenal, intuitive GUI that\ncan help us use our Snort rules to\n\n148\n00:06:31.447 --> 00:06:38.540\nour advantage, stop malware, do URL\nfiltering, and create lots more security.\n\n149\n00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.220\nAll on one screen,\nwith correlation between events.\n\n150\n00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.940\nYou got SEM reporting.\n\n151\n00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.588\nThat's a pretty big deal.\n\n152\n00:06:43.588 --> 00:06:47.359\nSo we've got all this stuff that can\noccur with this one piece of management.\n\n153\n00:06:47.359 --> 00:06:50.687\nAnd so again,\nif you're looking at other products say.\n\n154\n00:06:50.687 --> 00:06:53.592\nHey, I wanna see one administrative\ninterface for all of these.\n\n155\n00:06:53.592 --> 00:06:55.079\nI don't want this siloed approach.\n\n156\n00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:59.365\nWhere I have, appliance, appliance,\nappliance, appliance, VPN con triggers,\n\n157\n00:06:59.365 --> 00:07:00.923\nrouter switches and all this.\n\n158\n00:07:00.923 --> 00:07:02.964\nIn this case we've got our ASA.\n\n159\n00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:05.053\nYou, you can have an appliance as well.\n\n160\n00:07:05.053 --> 00:07:10.394\nBut the ASA is a phenomenal\nproduct to run this on.\n\n161\n00:07:10.394 --> 00:07:14.088\nWhat it does is it gives us our routing,\nswitching, VPN, and\n\n162\n00:07:14.088 --> 00:07:17.780\nall that other stuff that we\nall know that an ASA does.\n\n163\n00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.146\nBut now we have the power, or\nwhat we call FirePOWER, right.\n\n164\n00:07:21.146 --> 00:07:24.503\nSo FirePOWER, the term is very\nimportant to understand here, Don.\n\n165\n00:07:24.503 --> 00:07:26.406\nBecause, it's used a couple\nof different ways.\n\n166\n00:07:26.406 --> 00:07:30.798\nThis was created by Sourcefire before\nCisco bought them and FirePOWER came up.\n\n167\n00:07:30.798 --> 00:07:34.714\nAnd it really defines the power\nof the next generation IPS,\n\n168\n00:07:34.714 --> 00:07:36.602\nnext generation firewall.\n\n169\n00:07:36.602 --> 00:07:38.878\n>> And it just sounds cool\nas a marketing term, right?\n\n170\n00:07:38.878 --> 00:07:39.481\n>> It does.\n\n171\n00:07:39.481 --> 00:07:41.896\nAnd so, I don't show it here.\n\n172\n00:07:41.896 --> 00:07:46.411\nBut what the FirePOWER,\nwhere the power is all capitalized.\n\n173\n00:07:46.411 --> 00:07:47.386\nI think you're gonna see that going away.\n\n174\n00:07:47.386 --> 00:07:48.756\nSo now that Cisco's got it.\n\n175\n00:07:48.756 --> 00:07:51.341\nWhen you run an ASA with this product\n\n176\n00:07:51.341 --> 00:07:55.927\non it the actual term they call\nit is FirePOWER module, right?\n\n177\n00:07:55.927 --> 00:07:56.937\nIs that the case?\nI don't know.\n\n178\n00:07:56.937 --> 00:07:58.586\nI guess.\n\n179\n00:07:58.586 --> 00:08:01.267\nIt's really hard for\nme to define all these terms.\n\n180\n00:08:01.267 --> 00:08:02.217\nThey seem to change a lot.\n\n181\n00:08:02.217 --> 00:08:03.890\nAs I was writing the book,\nI just kinda gave up.\n\n182\n00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.474\nAnd says, I'm gonna call the FireSIGHT\nManagement Center, the Defense Center and\n\n183\n00:08:07.474 --> 00:08:08.644\njust kind of stick with it.\n\n184\n00:08:08.644 --> 00:08:11.569\nBut there's also another\nterm called FireSIGHT.\n\n185\n00:08:11.569 --> 00:08:13.706\nThis is a very powerful technology.\n\n186\n00:08:13.706 --> 00:08:16.906\nSo we see things like FirePOWER,\nFireSIGHT and\n\n187\n00:08:16.906 --> 00:08:22.349\nthey had a technological definition and\nnow they're kind of a lot of marketing.\n\n188\n00:08:22.349 --> 00:08:23.902\nSo, you actually probably saw,\n\n189\n00:08:23.902 --> 00:08:26.738\nit said FirePOWER with FireSIGHT\nadministration, right?\n\n190\n00:08:26.738 --> 00:08:27.736\nWhat does that mean?\n\n191\n00:08:27.736 --> 00:08:32.093\nThe FirePOWER again is our power\nof the next generation IPS.\n\n192\n00:08:32.093 --> 00:08:37.661\nAnd the FireSIGHT is actually a passive\ntechnology that scans our networks and\n\n193\n00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:42.228\ngathers information about user's hosts and\nin applications.\n\n194\n00:08:42.228 --> 00:08:43.900\nIt's a very powerful tool.\n\n195\n00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.316\nI love FireSIGHT.\n\n196\n00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:47.731\nAnd so we will go in that in\ndepth into these series, right?\n\n197\n00:08:47.731 --> 00:08:50.448\nInto FireSIGHT and\ninto how FirePOWER works and all that.\n\n198\n00:08:50.448 --> 00:08:51.771\nLet's take a little bit more.\n\n199\n00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:53.722\nWe won't spend a lot more\ntime in taking your time.\n\n200\n00:08:53.722 --> 00:08:57.112\nBut I want you guys to understand how\ngreat this product actually is, and\n\n201\n00:08:57.112 --> 00:08:58.846\nwhat it can do for your corporation.\n\n202\n00:08:58.846 --> 00:09:00.332\nAnd now there's yet another term.\n\n203\n00:09:00.332 --> 00:09:03.180\nSo we've got, well Sourcefire, right?\n\n204\n00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.883\nAnd that term is pretty much going away.\n\n205\n00:09:04.883 --> 00:09:06.601\nWe see it still a lot.\n\n206\n00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:08.923\nBut it's gonna be just Cisco, right?\n\n207\n00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:10.997\nAnd then we've got FirePOWER.\n\n208\n00:09:10.997 --> 00:09:13.895\nAnd that's the power again,\nas I mentioned of the next generation IPS,\n\n209\n00:09:13.895 --> 00:09:15.045\nnext generation firewall.\n\n210\n00:09:15.045 --> 00:09:17.390\nIt runs on our managed devices and\nour defense.\n\n211\n00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.630\nRemember our managed devices\nare in ASA with FirePOWER.\n\n212\n00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.603\nThey're already an appliance\nthat's running this.\n\n213\n00:09:23.603 --> 00:09:27.169\nAnd then we get all our vents and\ncorrelation back at the defense center,\n\n214\n00:09:27.169 --> 00:09:28.759\nFireSIGHT management center.\n\n215\n00:09:28.759 --> 00:09:29.897\nThe newbie I showed you.\n\n216\n00:09:29.897 --> 00:09:31.963\nThere's another term called FireSIGHT.\n\n217\n00:09:31.963 --> 00:09:36.564\nAnd, what this is, is a passive\ntechnology that runs in the background.\n\n218\n00:09:36.564 --> 00:09:39.760\nGathering information on host users and\napplications.\n\n219\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.320\nAnd it connects to our eld app.\n\n220\n00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:45.260\nAnd so now we can, so basically we can\nput a name and a user to an IP address or\n\n221\n00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:45.830\nsomething like that.\n\n222\n00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.990\nVery cool, powerful technology and\n\n223\n00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:52.990\nwe'll spend a lot of time on that\nwhen we go through the episodes.\n\n224\n00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.300\nLet me say there's yet\nanother term, right?\n\n225\n00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.570\nFireAMP and who knows where\nthese terms are gonna end up.\n\n226\n00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.760\nBut the fact is FireAMP\nadvanced mail protection.\n\n227\n00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.440\nThere's two types.\n\n228\n00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.220\nThere's a network based and a host based.\n\n229\n00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.760\nAnd we'll talk about that\nduring the episodes as well.\n\n230\n00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.480\nMalware is a big piece of this.\n\n231\n00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.040\nRight.\nAnd it is a separate license.\n\n232\n00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:10.950\nRight.\nEverything's separate.\n\n233\n00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.297\nCisco figured out this.\n\n234\n00:10:12.297 --> 00:10:15.791\nHey, we're not gonna just buy this product\nand give you this license forever.\n\n235\n00:10:15.791 --> 00:10:17.556\nWe want you to pay for\nus every year, right.\n\n236\n00:10:17.556 --> 00:10:18.720\nOr ever three years.\n\n237\n00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.420\nSo now let's just go back and take a look\nat the power of the correlating events.\n\n238\n00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.897\nAnd putting everything together\nin one nice intuitive GUI, right.\n\n239\n00:10:26.897 --> 00:10:28.506\nI'm gonna come down here.\n\n240\n00:10:28.506 --> 00:10:30.805\nThese are our top 15 attacked hosts.\n\n241\n00:10:30.805 --> 00:10:32.500\nSo we can get right there.\n\n242\n00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.250\nAnd I can go here and, let's say that i\nsee this host and I know it's a problem.\n\n243\n00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.610\nI can blacklist it from here.\n\n244\n00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.690\nI can just right click,\nblacklist, boom, done, right?\n\n245\n00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.400\nStuff like that adds things to,\nwhat's called security intelligence.\n\n246\n00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.500\nI have my whitelist, I have my blacklist.\n\n247\n00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:50.530\nAnd I basically can add and take things\nout of there and make my network safer.\n\n248\n00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.170\nSo it'd help me stop a zero-day attack.\n\n249\n00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.430\nNow, speaking of zero-day attacks.\n\n250\n00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.050\nThis is called an indication\nof compromise.\n\n251\n00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.528\nThis was the first known\nproduct a couple years ago.\n\n252\n00:10:59.528 --> 00:11:02.593\nWhere an attack occurred\nzero day attack occurred.\n\n253\n00:11:02.593 --> 00:11:06.320\nAnd these indication of compromise\ntold me something had changed on host.\n\n254\n00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.507\nSo we kind of bench marked these hosts and\nunderstand what's going and\n\n255\n00:11:09.507 --> 00:11:11.030\nFireSIGHT is paying attention.\n\n256\n00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.330\nAnd then all of a sudden\nsomething changes.\n\n257\n00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.180\nAnd we're seeing this pop, pop, pop, pop,\npop of these indications of comprise.\n\n258\n00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.706\nIt kinda looked something like this,\nwhich is pretty scary.\n\n259\n00:11:18.706 --> 00:11:23.447\nAnd the fact is, then we were able to just\ngo over there and blacklist the source and\n\n260\n00:11:23.447 --> 00:11:25.043\nstop that zero day attack.\n\n261\n00:11:25.043 --> 00:11:28.061\nIt was the first recorded stop\nof a zero day attack right away.\n\n262\n00:11:28.061 --> 00:11:29.153\nAnd I'm sure it's happening more now.\n\n263\n00:11:29.153 --> 00:11:30.825\nBut it was very kind of cool.\n\n264\n00:11:30.825 --> 00:11:34.721\nAnyways, so nonetheless, we can look at\nmalware and I can drill down in here.\n\n265\n00:11:34.721 --> 00:11:37.136\nNotice I can drill down\nto analysis on here.\n\n266\n00:11:37.136 --> 00:11:40.433\nI can go look at it and\nfind out the host and information.\n\n267\n00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:42.638\n>> All right, now Tom.\nThat's all some pretty impressive stuff.\n\n268\n00:11:42.638 --> 00:11:44.990\nAnd I know we talked before\nthe show a little bit.\n\n269\n00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.736\nWhen something's impressive and complex.\n\n270\n00:11:46.736 --> 00:11:49.267\nIt's not normally designed for\nsmall environments.\n\n271\n00:11:49.267 --> 00:11:52.420\nAnd so who's really the target\naudience for the product?\n\n272\n00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.990\nAnd who's the target audience for\nthis show, right?\n\n273\n00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.640\nWhat kind of person, and what kind\nof company would be deploying this?\n\n274\n00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.298\n>> Yeah, and that's a great question.\n\n275\n00:11:58.298 --> 00:12:02.299\nAnd this is what Cisco was able to take,\nthat SourceFire was not able to do.\n\n276\n00:12:02.299 --> 00:12:08.036\nAnd put this on even down to their SoHo\nproducts like the smallest ASA of 55O6X.\n\n277\n00:12:08.036 --> 00:12:13.125\nThat's the lowest model you can get,\nwhich is a really relatively inexpensive.\n\n278\n00:12:13.125 --> 00:12:17.213\nBut again, that would be real Soho,\nsmall office, home office,\n\n279\n00:12:17.213 --> 00:12:19.554\nmaybe a dozen users with this on here.\n\n280\n00:12:19.554 --> 00:12:21.877\nYou gotta remember this is going\nto add overhead to your network.\n\n281\n00:12:21.877 --> 00:12:26.855\nBut we can go all the way up through\nthe 5585 and get some serious power.\n\n282\n00:12:26.855 --> 00:12:28.713\nAnd if you need more throughput,\nand more power.\n\n283\n00:12:28.713 --> 00:12:34.070\nNow we can go from Soho all the way to the\nmost advanced data centers in the world.\n\n284\n00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:34.710\n>> Excellent.\n\n285\n00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.670\nSo, if you find yourself\nin that environment,\n\n286\n00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.650\nyou're working for a company,\nsmall, medium, large business.\n\n287\n00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.120\nSmall business you could\npull it off with the 5506's.\n\n288\n00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.140\nThat's really branch office kind\nof side where we'd see that.\n\n289\n00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.153\n>> Yeah, maybe at 5512 or 5515 or 25 or\n\n290\n00:12:48.153 --> 00:12:51.955\nsomething like that,\nagain I was just Make it an analogy.\n\n291\n00:12:51.955 --> 00:12:53.929\nThat, hey you can go all the way down.\n\n292\n00:12:53.929 --> 00:12:57.610\nAnd it is gonna be running on routers,\nor our routers we mentioned.\n\n293\n00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.880\n>> And it goes all the way up too.\n\n294\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.440\nThey've got the dedicated appliance.\n\n295\n00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.220\nI can't remember the model number for it.\n\n296\n00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.030\n>> Those are the 3D models.\n\n297\n00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:07.522\nYeah, so just add an extra\ncouple of zeros to your PO.\n\n298\n00:13:07.522 --> 00:13:09.659\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you can have that too.\n\n299\n00:13:09.659 --> 00:13:11.254\n>> So\nit can handle very powerful networks and\n\n300\n00:13:11.254 --> 00:13:13.965\ngive you a level of security you\ncouldn't necessarily achieve before.\n\n301\n00:13:13.965 --> 00:13:16.891\nNow if that sounds exciting to you,\nit should.\n\n302\n00:13:16.891 --> 00:13:17.633\nIt's really cool stuff.\n\n303\n00:13:17.633 --> 00:13:18.790\n>> Very cool stuff.\n\n304\n00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.250\n>> And you're in the right place.\n\n305\n00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.776\nSo stay tuned.\nWe've got FirePOWER\n\n306\n00:13:21.776 --> 00:13:25.117\nepisodes coming up where we get a chance\nto see all of this in action and\n\n307\n00:13:25.117 --> 00:13:27.024\nhow you can use it in your environment.\n\n308\n00:13:27.024 --> 00:13:28.232\nIf it doesn't sound right for you.\n\n309\n00:13:28.232 --> 00:13:30.810\nNo big deal there, we've got plenty of\nother content in the course library.\n\n310\n00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.434\nBe sure to check that out.\n\n311\n00:13:32.434 --> 00:13:36.081\nBut if you're looking for FirePOWER,\nstay tuned, it's coming up next.\n\n312\n00:13:36.081 -->

You hypothesize.\n\n57\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.380\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH] How do I\n\n58\n00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.190\nget to make capital letters?\n\n59\n00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.260\nYou hold the Shift key.\n\n60\n00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.470\nSo capital, hold the Shift+A, B, C.\n\n61\n00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.760\nAnd of course is this caps lock key,\nthat caps lock will lock\n\n62\n00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.880\non the keys to be in capital letters, and\nthen of course you also have numeric keys.\n\n63\n00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.700\nYou have alpha numeric keys,\nanything than A, a number.\n\n64\n00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.960\nSo if I wanted to type in one,\ntwo, three, I could type that in.\n\n65\n00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.030\nHit the space bar.\n\n66\n00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.380\nHold my shift key.\n\n67\n00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.110\nThen it goes into your other special\ncharacters like the exclamation,\n\n68\n00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.430\nthe at sign, the pound sign,\nthe dollar sign.\n\n69\n00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.870\nI guess that's also a number sign or\nnowadays, what is it?\n\n70\n00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:28.930\nIt's a hashtag.\n\n71\n00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.570\nYeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n72\n00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.220\n&gt;&gt; We always call it the, yeah,\n\n73\n00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.200\nthe hash sign.\n\n74\n00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.340\nThat's what we always call it.\n\n75\n00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, hash hash, hash tag.\n\n76\n00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.930\nSo I've always called it the pound sign.\n\n77\n00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the pound sign as well,\ncuz on a phone, back when Well,\n\n78\n00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.670\nI guess you used normal style\ntelephones that had one, two, three.\n\n79\n00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.790\nThat was know as the pound, so it would\nsay dial pound 732 or whatever, and\n\n80\n00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.510\nyou would get special\nthings on your phone.\n\n81\n00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.990\n&gt;&gt; Yes you could do.\n\n82\n00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.730\n&gt;&gt; Remember?\n&gt;&gt; Yes!\n\n83\n00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.520\nWhere you could get your voicemail.\n\n84\n00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.030\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n85\n00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.790\nyou could do like the three-way calling.\n\n86\n00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:58.355\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n87\n00:03:58.355 --> 00:04:00.280\n&gt;&gt; Three-way calling in middle school.\n\n88\n00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.130\nThat was, that was.\n\n89\n00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.480\n&gt;&gt; Changed your life, didn't it?\n\n90\n00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sometimes in a bad way.\n\n91\n00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.610\nMost of the time, it's in a bad way.\n\n92\n00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.233\nIt was, [SOUND] we were\nhorrible to each other, so.\n\n93\n00:04:08.233 --> 00:04:10.452\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Get off the phone, mom.\n\n94\n00:04:10.452 --> 00:04:14.130\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yeah, that's why\n\n95\n00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.380\nI remember pound 70 and pound 68 or\nsomething like that to get all those.\n\n96\n00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.080\nAlright, so I'm glad we're having\nthis psychology right here.\n\n97\n00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.620\nI'm having a little session to remind\nmyself of why, I call it the pound sign.\n\n98\n00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.340\nSo, we have all these different\ncharacters that are on our keyboard.\n\n99\n00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.510\nAnd all the pipe sign,\nyou know the double pipes,this one?\n\n100\n00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.455\n&gt;&gt; The logical or.\n\n101\n00:04:34.455 --> 00:04:36.370\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n102\n00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.410\n&gt;&gt; The logical or's and\n\n103\n00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.480\nthe double ampersands for and.\n\n104\n00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.560\n&gt;&gt; Logical ands, yep.\n\n105\n00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.132\n&gt;&gt; We're starting to digress\ninto multiple languages.\n\n106\n00:04:43.132 --> 00:04:44.640\n&gt;&gt; Yes, [LAUGH] this is geekdom.\n\n107\n00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.510\nHardcore geekdom.\n\n108\n00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.810\n&gt;&gt; I did say we were gonna talk about some\nlanguages, and so now we're getting into\n\n109\n00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.884\nprogramming and coding languages\nthat we need to come back to Word.\n\n110\n00:04:52.884 --> 00:04:54.592\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's talk about this.\n\n111\n00:04:54.592 --> 00:04:56.320\nSo How do I get down to the next line?\n\n112\n00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.010\nLike I said, you hit the Enter key.\n\n113\n00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.070\nSo I've made a paragraph.\n\n114\n00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.900\nI could type some letters into here,\nand pretend I can type, and\n\n115\n00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.590\nif I hit the Tab key.\n\n116\n00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.550\nNow, the Tab key, Daniel, let me ask you,\nwhat happens when you hit the Tab key?\n\n117\n00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.710\n&gt;&gt; If I'm remembering correctly, the Tab\nkey does a specific amount of white spaces\n\n118\n00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.070\nTo the right, and\nI think it's four by default.\n\n119\n00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.520\nOr eight.\nIs it eight or four?\n\n120\n00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.970\n&gt;&gt; Well as soon-\n&gt;&gt; I can't remember.\n\n121\n00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.750\n&gt;&gt; As you say it, I'm like, kind of,\nbut what threw me off was the spaces,\n\n122\n00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.720\nbut this is why I asked this-\n&gt;&gt; Blank characters.\n\n123\n00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes, because a lot of people,\nwhen I ask them, tab, what does it do?\n\n124\n00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.980\nThey're like, it takes you in five spaces.\n\n125\n00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.270\nThat's how I was always taught.\n\n126\n00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.080\nIt takes you in five spaces.\n\n127\n00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.500\nSo if I type some more letters, and\nI hit the tab key, that's five spaces.\n\n128\n00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.920\nType a few more letters, that's, wait\na second, so every time I'm hitting tab,\n\n129\n00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.830\nwhy am I getting different\namounts of space?\n\n130\n00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.430\nI thought you said it was five spaces?\n\n131\n00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.970\nSo that's where it's one of those like,\nI think it's, and\n\n132\n00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:57.840\nmaybe this is the day\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n133\n00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.180\n&gt;&gt; Of the old typewriters.\n\n134\n00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.581\nIs that it was hard coded, to where it\nmoved the carriage over five spaces\n\n135\n00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:07.160\n&gt;&gt; X amount of spaces, regardless if there\n\n136\n00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.852\nwas something in it already or not\n&gt;&gt; Correct\n\n137\n00:06:08.852 --> 00:06:09.544\n&gt;&gt; There you go\n\n138\n00:06:09.544 --> 00:06:11.950\n&gt;&gt; Well, when you get into computers, and\n\n139\n00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:17.350\nwe start getting to hear what a tab does,\nit takes you to the next\n\n140\n00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.430\ndefault tab stop on the ruler\nwhich is Every half inch.\n\n141\n00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.010\nTalked about seeing the ruler up here.\n\n142\n00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.120\nI know that there's tabs in here,\nokay, I know cuz I typed them in.\n\n143\n00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.440\nBut that's a tab,\nthat's a tab, that's a tab.\n\n144\n00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.520\nYou get a tab, you get a tab.\n\n145\n00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.230\nEverybody has tabs in here,\nbut it all corresponds to that\n\n146\n00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.540\nruler that's on the top here.\n\n147\n00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.070\nSo you could almost see\nthere's A one here,\n\n148\n00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.440\nand you're not gonna really\nknow exactly what I'm doing.\n\n149\n00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.290\nThere's another half here,\nthere's another, whoops,\n\n150\n00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.200\nI'm actually making tab stops.\n\n151\n00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.680\nSo there's that half, so every half mark\non the ruler is where the tab stops.\n\n152\n00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.260\nNow, this line of text right here,\nnotice that it went over.\n\n153\n00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:01.780\nWhat was that?\n\n154\n00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.470\nThree.\n\n155\n00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.280\nIt went past the three and a half,\nso the next stop is at four.\n\n156\n00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.590\nSo, it's not five spaces,\nit's every half inch on the ruler, and\n\n157\n00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.180\nthat's why I think that\n&gt;&gt; And that's specific to Word, correct?\n\n158\n00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.240\nBecause if I was using some text editor\n\n159\n00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.610\nin a terminal environment,\nthat might be different, right?\n\n160\n00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.430\nSo, where as Word has said, okay,\nwe're looking at document typing.\n\n161\n00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.240\nLet's set a standard and we'll use that.\n\n162\n00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you're exactly correct,\nbecause tabs do something different in\n\n163\n00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.710\nother programs so, yes, and\nif you talk to coders about\n\n164\n00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.950\nthe difference between tabs and spaces\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHS] Yeah.\n\n165\n00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.300\nThere is whole episodes online.\n\n166\n00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.180\nOne of my favorite shows that talks about\nit is hilarious, but again I'm digressing.\n\n167\n00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.140\nBut yes, tabs versus spaces.\n\n168\n00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.711\nCoders, that's like, you know,\nbad territory to start debating there.\n\n169\n00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:55.847\nBut in Word, like you're saying,\nit is every half inch on the ruler mark.\n\n170\n00:07:55.847 --> 00:08:01.874\nAnd if I hit enter again after the n\nI'm typing in There's something else.\n\n171\n00:08:01.874 --> 00:08:06.740\nWhen I type Enter, that's a hard return,\nit is making an actual paragraph.\n\n172\n00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.770\nThere is also something known as a soft\nreturn, or also known as a line break.\n\n173\n00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.990\nI'm just typing in blah-be-blahs,\n\n174\n00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:19.775\nI'm not going to not do the Enter key,\nI'm doing Shift+Enter.\n\n175\n00:08:19.775 --> 00:08:24.410\nShift+Enter takes me to the next line,\nbut it doesn't break the paragraph,\n\n176\n00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.590\nand I'll have some more text.\n\n177\n00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.000\nI'm gonna hit Enter, and\nthere's my difference.\n\n178\n00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.723\nNow, if I'm looking at this right here,\nI have no clue as, is this five spaces, or\n\n179\n00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:39.857\ndid somebody hit the Space, Space, Space,\nSpace, Space, and how many people do that?\n\n180\n00:08:39.857 --> 00:08:42.556\nI got to move over, Space, Space,\nSpace, then you got to move over.\n\n181\n00:08:42.556 --> 00:08:44.450\nNo, use tabs, use tabs!\n\n182\n00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.300\nWatch my episode on tabs, I love them.\n\n183\n00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:51.500\nSo, I don't know if these are spaces, or\ntabs, or a line break, or a hard return.\n\n184\n00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.640\nWhat's going on in here?\n\n185\n00:08:53.830 --> 00:09:00.100\nThis wonderful button here,\nthis show/hide character button.\n\n186\n00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.550\nI always have this on,\nalways, because I do so\n\n187\n00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.980\nmuch typesetting that I need\nto know what's going on here.\n\n188\n00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:11.730\nAs soon as you turn this on, it's going to\nshow you everyplace that there is a space.\n\n189\n00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.320\nIndicated by a dot, where there is a tab.\n\n190\n00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.630\nIndicated by an arrow,\nwhere there is a line break.\n\n191\n00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:23.130\nSee that that is not the same\nAs the enter mark on\n\n192\n00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.630\nthe paragraph, that is a paragraph,\nthat is a line break.\n\n193\n00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:31.300\nSo if I'm trying to format this with tabs,\nand\n\n194\n00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.570\nthere are just a bunch of spaces, I'm\nnot going to be able to do anything with\n\n195\n00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:36.540\nmy tabs because there's\nno character in there.\n\n196\n00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.050\nThere.\n\n197\n00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.290\nSo having this on is gonna show\nyou all of those different things.\n\n198\n00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.910\nIf I had a page break,\nyou see it, if you have sections,\n\n199\n00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:49.470\nif you have all those different things\nthat you don't see, it's there.\n\n200\n00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:54.830\nIt's just different commands\nthat Is that you are telling\n\n201\n00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:59.770\nWord how to organize all of\nthe information on your page.\n\n202\n00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:07.610\nSo that's very important to understand\nthat button, and why you need to have it.\n\n203\n00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.680\nThis also starts to get into\nthe wonderful world of.\n\n204\n00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.520\nANSI characters.\n\n205\n00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.180\nAnd yes,\n\n206\n00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.100\nhe's laughing over here cuz I said\nwe're gonna get into our geek session.\n\n207\n00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.960\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nget into this right now.\n\n208\n00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.710\n&gt;&gt; Not antsy like they\nare trying to dance around and\n\n209\n00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.870\nthey just can't sit in their seats still,\nright?\n\n210\n00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.393\n&gt;&gt; Antsy pants, antsy pants, yeah.\n\n211\n00:10:26.393 --> 00:10:27.941\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; ANSI, right?\n\n212\n00:10:27.941 --> 00:10:32.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's actually AS, whoops,\nthere's ANSI and there's ASCII.\n\n213\n00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.190\n&gt;&gt; And ASCII, right.\n\n214\n00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.230\n&gt;&gt; So let me, yes, you are correct, ANSI.\n\n215\n00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Which.\n\n216\n00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.890\nI don't remember what that stands for\nbut [LAUGH] there is the ASCI so\n\n217\n00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.780\nI said ANSI and ASCI so they're usually\nkinda together because what we're talking\n\n218\n00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.700\nabout here is we're talking\nabout character sets okay.\n\n219\n00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.730\nThink about I just said alphanumerical\ncharacters when we're talking\n\n220\n00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.300\nabout that we're talking about a's.\n\n221\n00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.950\nAnd numbers and maybe sometimes,\nthose special characters but\n\n222\n00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.810\nwhat about the copyright symbol,\nor the trademark symbol?\n\n223\n00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:06.730\nThere are different characters that we\nhave that you could ahead and print.\n\n224\n00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:11.330\nTake that a little bit further,\nwhat about different languages?\n\n225\n00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.560\nLike, we're talking about English where we\nhave a specific character set well what if\n\n226\n00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.270\nwe're talking about Greek or Russian, or\n\n227\n00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:23.310\nyou're talking about a Middle Eastern\nlanguage that has different characters, or\n\n228\n00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.890\nwe talked about, I think it's in\nGerman where you have the umlaut.\n\n229\n00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:26.640\n&gt;&gt; The umlaut, yeah.\n\n230\n00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.630\n&gt;&gt; I love that word, the umlaut.\n\n231\n00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.660\nThose are the two little\ndots on top of your O.\n\n232\n00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.540\n&gt;&gt; Or the grave or accents.\n\n233\n00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:37.840\n&gt;&gt; yes, yes, the tilde on the N's\nin Spanish and all that good stuff.\n\n234\n00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.370\nHow do you do that?\n\n235\n00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:40.630\n&gt;&gt; I will show you.\n\n236\n00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.290\nWell if you are typing in\na different language then that's\n\n237\n00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:48.460\nwhere you do have to talk about\nsetting your languages in Word.\n\n238\n00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.210\nSo if you are typing a little like...\n\n239\n00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.990\nMaybe I need one letter\nwith the accent on it.\n\n240\n00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.190\nThe e with the accent on or\nthe n with the tilde.\n\n241\n00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:59.030\nBut I'm not using it all time Then\nthose are things that you can do to\n\n242\n00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.120\ninsert special characters.\n\n243\n00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.990\nAnd I actually have a link in\nthe show notes to where if you\n\n244\n00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.320\nare using specific characters\nthat do have accent marks.\n\n245\n00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.040\nThere's keyboard shortcuts to go ahead and\nmap to that so.\n\n246\n00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.480\nBut back over to this whole\nidea about a character set.\n\n247\n00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:21.550\nAnd let me switch over to Wikipedia\nbecause I have an article about ASCII,\n\n248\n00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.504\nthe American Standard Code for\nInformation Interchange.\n\n249\n00:12:24.504 --> 00:12:25.544\n&gt;&gt; Say that three times.\n\n250\n00:12:25.544 --> 00:12:27.360\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I know.\n\n251\n00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:32.510\nIt is a character and coding standard\nthat is designated by someone and\n\n252\n00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.430\nit represents text in computers.\n\n253\n00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.601\nDid you like how I just\nskipped on over that?\n\n254\n00:12:36.601 --> 00:12:39.681\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, blah blah blah blah blah,\ncharacter stuff.\n\n255\n00:12:39.681 --> 00:12:43.050\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Represents text in computers,\ntelecommunications equipment, and\n\n256\n00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:43.570\nother devices.\n\n257\n00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:45.760\nAll right.\n\n258\n00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.940\nSo when we talk about our computers,\nwe have input devices and\n\n259\n00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:54.330\noutput devices, because Daniel what are\nwe, when we're working with computers and\n\n260\n00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.830\nall this information,\nit really boils down to what?\n\n261\n00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.340\nWhat's the base?\n\n262\n00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.600\n&gt;&gt; The base is us being able\nto interact with the computer\n\n263\n00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.410\nitself\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n264\n00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.460\nit being able to interact with us back.\n\n265\n00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:05.550\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So we need to be able to\n\n266\n00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.620\ninput information.\n\n267\n00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.850\nIt needs to be able to output readable\ninformation for us as humans.\n\n268\n00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.850\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and\nit's all about electrical signals.\n\n269\n00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:12.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n270\n00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:15.770\n&gt;&gt; And those electrical\nsignals are represented in?\n\n271\n00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:17.120\n&gt;&gt; Binary.\n\n272\n00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.720\nYes.\n\n273\n00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.740\nAnd there are ones and zeroes.\n\n274\n00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.310\n&gt;&gt; Ones and zeroes.\n\n275\n00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:21.540\n&gt;&gt; Everything is ones and zeroes.\n\n276\n00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:26.320\nThe whole, talk about the matrix, where\nyou see all the letters, right, yeah.\n\n277\n00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.540\nI mean, that's modern type stuff,\n\n278\n00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.540\nbut it really does boil down to it's on or\nit's off.\n\n279\n00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:37.560\nSo when I am clicking the letter A on my\nkeyboard, the keyboard is an input device,\n\n280\n00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.090\nit is inputting information\ninto the computer.\n\n281\n00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:46.320\nMy screen is outputting that information,\nso when I click the letter A, there's\n\n282\n00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:52.890\nsome type of electrical signal that that\nis saying, A's being pushed, display A.\n\n283\n00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.120\nWhat about the b or the c or the d?\n\n284\n00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:02.270\nIt's all code, it's all this mapped code\nthat is represented in these machines.\n\n285\n00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.220\nBecause we're actually\ntalking about machines here,\n\n286\n00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.320\nright, that have [INAUDIBLE] And\nall that wonderful sub.\n\n287\n00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.840\nAnd back in the day,\nwe didn't have all this fancy computers,\n\n288\n00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.960\nI never was around for the punch cards.\n\n289\n00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.150\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; People tell me about-\n\n290\n00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.260\n&gt;&gt; So, I worked at a company where they\n\n291\n00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:23.560\nhad done that for many years and\nobviously they're modern now.\n\n292\n00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.860\nBut they still have a lot of\ntheir old equipment around and\n\n293\n00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.820\nthey had punch card operating machines.\n\n294\n00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.000\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Like sitting in a room.\n\n295\n00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.190\nWith cards and everything, yeah they had\nreal tapes from old main frame stuff,\n\n296\n00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.514\nit was really cool,\nit was like a museum in a lot of ways.\n\n297\n00:14:36.514 --> 00:14:37.620\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n298\n00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.350\n&gt;&gt; Of course we had a server room with\nall modern server virtualization and\n\n299\n00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.190\nwhat not but\nthat stuff is still hanging around.\n\n300\n00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:45.730\nSo you just grab one and\nplay with it, it's a lot of fun.\n\n301\n00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and if you read this article,\nI'm not gonna read this for\n\n302\n00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.530\nyou and again I don't wanna go to\nfar down the rabbit hole, right?\n\n303\n00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.370\nBecause it can get Really...\n\n304\n00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.240\n&gt;&gt; Heady?\n&gt;&gt; Yes, very heady, very quickly.\n\n305\n00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.780\nSo trying to stay up on\nthe surface up here.\n\n306\n00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.740\nYou had to have, I'm talking about\nthose non-printing characters,\n\n307\n00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.200\nto kind of bring it on back\nto where I had started.\n\n308\n00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.910\nThe, when am I doing a line return or\na soft return versus a carriage return?\n\n309\n00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:16.290\nI think i've used that terminology\nin other episodes where I am saying\n\n310\n00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:18.420\nenter is a carriage return.\n\n311\n00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.160\nThink about back to even like\nthe old typewriters, right.\n\n312\n00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.480\nWhen you, it got to the end you had to\ntell the carriage to actually return and\n\n313\n00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.270\nmove down a line.\n\n314\n00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:28.310\nIt had to be.\n\n315\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:32.080\n&gt;&gt; It was called a carriage,\nhence the terminology carriage return.\n\n316\n00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:36.345\nJust basically bringing all the stuff over\nfrom old style teletype and texts, yeah.\n\n317\n00:15:36.345 --> 00:15:39.500\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah.\nAnd so they're talking about that ask,\n\n318\n00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.060\nI keep saying antsy Well, I did say ASCII.\n\n319\n00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:42.890\n&gt;&gt; You did say ASCII.\n\n320\n00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.223\n&gt;&gt; I get them kinda confused, but\n\n321\n00:15:45.223 --> 00:15:51.163\nthere's ASCII,and when it was first\nstarted it was a 7-bit character set.\n\n322\n00:15:51.163 --> 00:15:55.015\nThere's 128 characters\nthat were available, and\n\n323\n00:15:55.015 --> 00:16:00.375\nit's talking about how the first 32\ncodes Where for control characters,\n\n324\n00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:04.645\nfor those that were not\nrepresented in printable language,\n\n325\n00:16:04.645 --> 00:16:09.810\nit's those things like, did you move\nover five spaces or did you tab?\n\n326\n00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:12.300\nDid you enter,\ndid you do a carriage return?\n\n327\n00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.510\nAre we just line feeding?\n\n328\n00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:17.470\nAre we just gonna keep on moving down or\ndo we need to move things around?\n\n329\n00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:22.940\nSo these non printed characters, it comes\ndown from the base of everything that we\n\n330\n00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:27.460\ntalk about in, or talk meaning like\nwe input text into our devices,\n\n331\n00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:31.250\nit's all based off of\nthis ASCII character set.\n\n332\n00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.960\nAnd it started out with just,\nall right, some as and some bs and\n\n333\n00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.000\nsome numbers, and all of these different\nthings to make our machines do things.\n\n334\n00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.840\nLike backspace and so on and so forth.\n\n335\n00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.880\nAnd there's something down in here,\n\n336\n00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:49.280\nI'm trying to just point out things that\nmight actually represent things to us now.\n\n337\n00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.330\nAnd remember I talked about there's like\na code, look at where I said, binary.\n\n338\n00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.040\nThere is an actual binary.\n\n339\n00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.550\nSee that I talked about line feeds and\nthese backspace, the shift.\n\n340\n00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.970\nIf I keep on moving down, these are all\nthe characters that you have, where it's\n\n341\n00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:07.890\nmoving around our device, either physical\nmachinery or in this case our computer.\n\n342\n00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:13.470\nSo where is that cursor going to and\nall those different 1's and 0's?\n\n343\n00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.490\nThis one right here.\n\n344\n00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:20.650\nCodes 20 for representation, and\nthe code for the space characters.\n\n345\n00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:25.700\nDanny, have you ever gotten a file name\nfrom somebody, and in the title there's\n\n346\n00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:30.220\nlike character character, %20, something,\nsomething %20, have you ever seen that?\n\n347\n00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:34.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the machine going, I need\nto put something here as a place, so\n\n348\n00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.920\nit can't be blank.\n\n349\n00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.160\nSo it just throws up it's character\nrepresentation from this.\n\n350\n00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:44.485\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's going back to its\nsource language of a space is 20-\n\n351\n00:17:44.485 --> 00:17:45.470\n&gt;&gt; It'd be like a hex value.\n\n352\n00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:50.692\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz we're taking about\nthese encoding character sets,\n\n353\n00:17:50.692 --> 00:17:54.248\nencoding languages,\njust think of them as language.\n\n354\n00:17:54.248 --> 00:17:56.223\nLike we're just speaking in English,\nor Spanish, or French.\n\n355\n00:17:56.223 --> 00:18:00.987\nAnd so, it's saying, well, I don't know\nwhat this is cuz it's speaking in French,\n\n356\n00:18:00.987 --> 00:18:04.190\nbut I'm sending it to somebody in English.\n\n357\n00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:08.177\nBut I know that a space is 20, so\nI'm gonna throw a 20 sign in there.\n\n358\n00:18:08.177 --> 00:18:09.776\n&gt;&gt; Interestingly enough,\n\n359\n00:18:09.776 --> 00:18:14.042\nthis is how hackers actually get\naround sanitation of your input.\n\n360\n00:18:14.042 --> 00:18:17.600\nSo you can create a Word document,\nyou can put a web link in there, correct?\n\n361\n00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.070\nAnd you can click on that link and\nit'll take you somewhere.\n\n362\n00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:24.809\nBut if your website or\nyour web security is looking for\n\n363\n00:18:24.809 --> 00:18:28.508\ncertain things like a .com of some sort.\n\n364\n00:18:28.508 --> 00:18:32.816\nI can actually put it in using their hex\nvalues and it might not be checking for\n\n365\n00:18:32.816 --> 00:18:35.320\nthat and\nstill take you to a malicious area.\n\n366\n00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:39.408\nSo it's really important for\nus to be able to look at these things and\n\n367\n00:18:39.408 --> 00:18:44.230\nsee why is %20 showing up instead of\nsomething, like the normal character?\n\n368\n00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:48.885\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember how you could mask\nemail addresses you'd have from spammers,\n\n369\n00:18:48.885 --> 00:18:51.080\nfrom spambots and stop spamming you.\n\n370\n00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.377\nThis was like a while ago,\nback when I was teaching this.\n\n371\n00:18:53.377 --> 00:18:56.928\nAnd you could type in each letter\nin their hex value or their binary,\n\n372\n00:18:56.928 --> 00:19:01.360\ncuz binary is hex and hex is binary,\nall these kind of different translations.\n\n373\n00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:07.772\nTo where it shows, it is outputting on our\ndevice that it looks like Vonne@Smith.com.\n\n374\n00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:10.883\n&gt;&gt; It's really a pain in\nthe keister to try to do [LAUGH].\n\n375\n00:19:10.883 --> 00:19:12.676\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, it's-\n&gt;&gt; But it is doable.\n\n376\n00:19:12.676 --> 00:19:16.338\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I mean we take for\ngranted, we just type.\n\n377\n00:19:16.338 --> 00:19:19.591\nBut all of this stuff is going\non in the background, and\n\n378\n00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:24.355\nall of our things that we're typing in is\nbased off of this base ASCII language.\n\n379\n00:19:24.355 --> 00:19:26.605\nAnd so here's all the printable codes.\n\n380\n00:19:26.605 --> 00:19:28.971\nThere's the binary,\nthere's the code for the letter A.\n\n381\n00:19:28.971 --> 00:19:31.616\n&gt;&gt; 41, I know that one very well.\n\n382\n00:19:31.616 --> 00:19:33.398\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; For writing exploit code, yeah.\n\n383\n00:19:33.398 --> 00:19:34.796\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I use it a lot.\n\n384\n00:19:34.796 --> 00:19:36.455\n&gt;&gt; What are you exploiting?\n\n385\n00:19:36.455 --> 00:19:38.205\nI know you do a lot of-\n&gt;&gt; Many things, yes.\n\n386\n00:19:38.205 --> 00:19:41.070\n&gt;&gt; I know you do a lot of stuff\nwith security and pen testing.\n\n387\n00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:45.131\nSo penetration testing of security\nnetworks and all that kind of fun.\n\n388\n00:19:45.131 --> 00:19:48.067\nI just sounded like really\nsmart right there, didn't I?\n\n389\n00:19:48.067 --> 00:19:51.170\n[LAUGH] So you get in the zone\nthat techie heady stuff.\n\n390\n00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:55.593\nBut just getting back to everything is\ncoded and there are character sets and\n\n391\n00:19:55.593 --> 00:19:56.630\nthese letters and\n\n392\n00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:00.795\nthese numbers that really mean\nsomething in the back to your computer.\n\n393\n00:20:00.795 --> 00:20:06.632\nIt was talking also about right here in\n1963, that it was determined that this\n\n394\n00:20:06.632 --> 00:20:12.234\nwas going to be the language that all\ncomputers or machines were gonna talk in.\n\n395\n00:20:12.234 --> 00:20:15.390\nAgain, I don't want to\ngo too deep into this.\n\n396\n00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:17.425\nBut it's just one of those, I love the-\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n397\n00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:20.442\nit's nice to know where it came from and\nthe evolution of it so\n\n398\n00:20:20.442 --> 00:20:23.650\nthat you can understand it better\nwhen you're working with it.\n\n399\n00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:27.050\nOtherwise it's just a bunch of stuff and\nyou're like, why does this thing do this?\n\n400\n00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:27.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n401\n00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:32.032\n&gt;&gt; And how a little bit of the back story\ncan help out with that which can help you\n\n402\n00:20:32.032 --> 00:20:36.441\nunderstand why it's doing certain things\nand maybe overcome some obstacles.\n\n403\n00:20:36.441 --> 00:20:38.860\n&gt;&gt; Why the %20 comes up in\nsome of your file names.\n\n404\n00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.728\nEspecially when a lot of times\nit goes from like Mac to PC.\n\n405\n00:20:41.728 --> 00:20:43.205\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I get that a lot so,\n\n406\n00:20:43.205 --> 00:20:46.070\nthe 7-bit encoding and the 128.\n\n407\n00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.946\nThis is where you hear\nthese numbers a lot.\n\n408\n00:20:49.946 --> 00:20:56.530\nIf you're in a computer talk enough, you\nhear 128, you hear 256, you hear 65,536.\n\n409\n00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:02.075\nBecause these are all 2 to the certain\npower, we're talking about exponents.\n\n410\n00:21:02.075 --> 00:21:04.650\nI noticed, we're getting into math,\nit starts getting scary.\n\n411\n00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:06.019\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just started sweating.\n\n412\n00:21:06.019 --> 00:21:08.692\nJust started sweating, help me.\n\n413\n00:21:08.692 --> 00:21:10.018\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n414\n00:21:10.018 --> 00:21:14.978\nSo 2 to the 8th is, and I had to write\nthis down to make sure I was doing it,\n\n415\n00:21:14.978 --> 00:21:17.380\nso to the 8th in binary is a 128.\n\n416\n00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:18.550\n2 to the 16th is 65,536.\n\n417\n00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.100\n2 to the 24 is-\n&gt;&gt; 4 point, no its not, yeah.\n\n418\n00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.325\n&gt;&gt; One million, wait, 16 million,\n777 thousand, a lot of numbers [LAUGH].\n\n419\n00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:26.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and to 32 it's 4.3 billion.\n\n420\n00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nI have it written down right there.\n\n421\n00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, see we work in computers.\n\n422\n00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:33.135\nWe hear these numbers quite often.\n\n423\n00:21:33.135 --> 00:21:34.782\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the other thing,\n\n424\n00:21:34.782 --> 00:21:38.096\nif you go into gaming, remember like\nback where we had 8-bit gaming systems,\n\n425\n00:21:38.096 --> 00:21:41.220\nwhere just it had those little squares\nlike Super Mario and all that stuff.\n\n426\n00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.615\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And then you went to 16-bit.\n\n427\n00:21:42.615 --> 00:21:46.933\n&gt;&gt; And you were like that means\nit can hold more information,\n\n428\n00:21:46.933 --> 00:21:50.350\ntherefore render a higher quality graphic.\n\n429\n00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.770\nHence the reason this looks so\n\n430\n00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.440\ngood compared to what our previous\ngame systems looked like.\n\n431\n00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.889\nThere you go,\nnow you understand the bit technology.\n\n432\n00:21:56.889 --> 00:22:00.426\n&gt;&gt; And then you get into 32-bit operating\nsystems, 64-bit operating systems,\n\n433\n00:22:00.426 --> 00:22:03.180\nbecause now it's not just like,\nwhat is your operating system?\n\n434\n00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.892\nIt's like, I'm Windows 10 64-bit,\nI'm Windows 8 32-bit,\n\n435\n00:22:07.892 --> 00:22:12.420\nbecause think about the bigger the number,\nthe more stuff it can hold.\n\n436\n00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.000\nTranslate this into your televisions,\nright?\n\n437\n00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.650\nAll of these, hey,\nit can display 50 million colors and\n\n438\n00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:21.183\nthe colors are so rich, it's because,\n\n439\n00:22:21.183 --> 00:22:25.600\nit's just the byte information that\nis allowed in these devices now.\n\n440\n00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.689\nWe keep getting smaller but yet\n\n441\n00:22:27.689 --> 00:22:31.395\nwe keep getting bigger in\nwhat we can display and show.\n\n442\n00:22:31.395 --> 00:22:33.960\nAnd so\nall of this is on that base of binary.\n\n443\n00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:38.568\nIt's 1's and 0's, either on or off,\nand then how much this stuff can do.\n\n444\n00:22:38.568 --> 00:22:43.105\n&gt;&gt; At the end of the day, that's just\na processor going, here is a binary value.\n\n445\n00:22:43.105 --> 00:22:45.716\nLet me calculate that and turn\nthe correct switches, and there you go.\n\n446\n00:22:45.716 --> 00:22:47.884\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and-\n&gt;&gt; And it just does it really fast.\n\n447\n00:22:47.884 --> 00:22:48.384\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n448\n00:22:48.384 --> 00:22:50.424\n&gt;&gt; And they're like, you can't see them,\n\n449\n00:22:50.424 --> 00:22:52.351\nwith all these chips and everything.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n450\n00:22:52.351 --> 00:22:52.997\n&gt;&gt; But again,\n\n451\n00:22:52.997 --> 00:22:56.245\nit all comes back to this and\nit's talking about letters.\n\n452\n00:22:56.245 --> 00:22:59.122\nIf we come back down in this page,\nwhere we have the 8-bit length.\n\n453\n00:22:59.122 --> 00:23:00.836\nThink about, like I said,\n\n454\n00:23:00.836 --> 00:23:05.620\nwhat about different languages that\ndon't have just As and Bs and Cs and Ds?\n\n455\n00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.530\nWe need different characters.\n\n456\n00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:09.765\nYou start getting into your\nEastern languages, and\n\n457\n00:23:09.765 --> 00:23:12.423\nyou have your double-byte congee fonts.\n\n458\n00:23:12.423 --> 00:23:15.923\nAnd you have things that are in\nactual graphical representations but\n\n459\n00:23:15.923 --> 00:23:17.500\nthey're still letters.\n\n460\n00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.290\nSo how could we display on this?\n\n461\n00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:23.397\nAnd this is where ASCII started and\nthen you had to go a little bit further.\n\n462\n00:23:23.397 --> 00:23:29.170\nAnd then you start getting into things\nlike Unicode, and this character set.\n\n463\n00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:33.750\nAnd you can see, UTF 8 UTF 16, UTF 32.\n\n464\n00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:38.110\nHow much support will this\ncharacter set allow you to have?\n\n465\n00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:45.240\nAnd so you can see that this is where it\nstarted, ASCII is the base of Unicode.\n\n466\n00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.613\nUnicode is what we now\nreally kind of work with and\n\n467\n00:23:48.613 --> 00:23:52.003\nwhen you start getting\ninto how different code.\n\n468\n00:23:52.003 --> 00:23:54.821\nI know with languages,\nlike computer languages,\n\n469\n00:23:54.821 --> 00:23:58.633\nyou start formatting webpages and\nhow databases talk to each other.\n\n470\n00:23:58.633 --> 00:24:04.421\nAnd how you have to designate\nWhat character set you're using?\n\n471\n00:24:04.421 --> 00:24:07.544\nIt's like the ISO something 49.\n\n472\n00:24:07.544 --> 00:24:11.149\nIt's like the standard Latin,\nokay, we're in a Latin language,\n\n473\n00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:14.570\nmeaning that we can have\nthese Latin characters.\n\n474\n00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.430\nWe're not in Chinese or\n\n475\n00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:20.880\nKorean or a different type of language\nthat we need a different character set.\n\n476\n00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.729\nSo you just have to designate\nthat this is what we're using.\n\n477\n00:24:23.729 --> 00:24:28.143\nAnd just to throw over that other\nweb page that's talking about with\n\n478\n00:24:28.143 --> 00:24:30.552\nthe Universal Coded Character Set.\n\n479\n00:24:30.552 --> 00:24:38.158\nAnd it starts getting into the lines\nwhere it has 128 groups of 256 planes.\n\n480\n00:24:38.158 --> 00:24:39.479\nLook at those numbers again.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there they are.\n\n481\n00:24:39.479 --> 00:24:41.383\n&gt;&gt; 128 and 256, right?\n\n482\n00:24:41.383 --> 00:24:43.300\nThey're all based on two.\n\n483\n00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:45.780\nAnd that gets to where you have so\n\n484\n00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:49.790\nmany characters that can be\nallowed in a character set.\n\n485\n00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:54.840\nSo small little techie,\ngeeky history lesson about how\n\n486\n00:24:54.840 --> 00:25:00.070\nwe're even getting to, in Word,\nbeing able to type these letters.\n\n487\n00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:03.955\nAnd what these non-printed characters,\nand then,\n\n488\n00:25:03.955 --> 00:25:09.649\ncoming back full circle, what about if\nI do need to insert a copyright symbol,\n\n489\n00:25:09.649 --> 00:25:13.388\nor I need to insert the n\nwith the tilde on it, the ñ?\n\n490\n00:25:13.388 --> 00:25:18.133\nI need to get a different character\nbesides the ones that I can actually\n\n491\n00:25:18.133 --> 00:25:20.960\nclick on the keyboard on my input device.\n\n492\n00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.220\nIt's there, I just can't type it.\n\n493\n00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:28.135\nYou go into your Insert menu,\nand you come over to your Symbol.\n\n494\n00:25:28.135 --> 00:25:31.940\nAnd in the Symbol,\nyou have some basic characters.\n\n495\n00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.650\nYou come into more symbols.\n\n496\n00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:40.170\nAnd if you read that whole Wikipedia\narticle and really get into the geeky\n\n497\n00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:45.830\nstuff, the different subsets of where\nthe Greek Extended, the Latin Extended.\n\n498\n00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:50.220\nAll of those base off of the that ASCII,\nbut then you got to make it a little bit\n\n499\n00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.760\nbigger to support all those\ndifferent characters.\n\n500\n00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.310\nAnd there's a lot of different categories.\n\n501\n00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:59.502\nBut if I start scrolling down\nthrough here, and you can see, okay,\n\n502\n00:25:59.502 --> 00:26:02.526\nlike what we would consider in\nEnglish our regular characters,\n\n503\n00:26:02.526 --> 00:26:05.607\nthen you get into your character\nwith the umlauts and the tildes.\n\n504\n00:26:05.607 --> 00:26:06.228\n&gt;&gt; Umlaut? [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n505\n00:26:06.228 --> 00:26:07.004\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Umlaut!\n\n506\n00:26:07.004 --> 00:26:11.120\n[LAUGH] So you get into these characters,\nand you keep on scrolling down.\n\n507\n00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.826\nAnd you get into, I don't know what\nthose are, but they're something.\n\n508\n00:26:13.826 --> 00:26:14.532\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Some script [CROSSTALK].\n\n509\n00:26:14.532 --> 00:26:15.510\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n510\n00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:16.639\nThen you get into,\n\n511\n00:26:16.639 --> 00:26:20.680\nlike these looks a little bit\nmore like the Cyrillic languages.\n\n512\n00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:24.466\nSo you get into languages that look\nmore like either Russian or Greek.\n\n513\n00:26:24.466 --> 00:26:26.950\n&gt;&gt; That looks like Hebrew right there,\nor something.\n\n514\n00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so\nyou get into these languages, and\n\n515\n00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.640\nthen you get into some of your\nMiddle Eastern languages.\n\n516\n00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.248\nSo these are all, and\nyou can see that subset changing.\n\n517\n00:26:35.248 --> 00:26:38.465\nAnd I can feel myself talking faster,\ncuz I'm getting really excited.\n\n518\n00:26:38.465 --> 00:26:41.903\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Calm down, Windmill, calm down.\n\n519\n00:26:41.903 --> 00:26:42.566\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\n\n520\n00:26:42.566 --> 00:26:45.882\nnow cuz I really just wanted\nthe copyright symbol.\n\n521\n00:26:45.882 --> 00:26:46.640\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Where is it?\n\n522\n00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:51.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So it is in one of the most\nrecently used, cuz I was using this.\n\n523\n00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.289\nAnd it's a very common symbol\nthat you might want to.\n\n524\n00:26:54.289 --> 00:26:58.629\nI'm gonna single-click on it, because\nthese character codes we talked about that\n\n525\n00:26:58.629 --> 00:27:00.717\nit did have a character, Unicode.\n\n526\n00:27:00.717 --> 00:27:01.410\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n527\n00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:02.170\n&gt;&gt; We were just talking about that.\n\n528\n00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:03.754\n&gt;&gt; Yes, what a coincidence.\n\n529\n00:27:03.754 --> 00:27:04.802\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n530\n00:27:04.802 --> 00:27:08.234\n[LAUGH] Round and round, come full circle.\n\n531\n00:27:08.234 --> 00:27:09.430\nAll good, circular.\n\n532\n00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.980\nAnd you can see that\nthere is a shortcut here.\n\n533\n00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:16.655\nIf I wanted to type it in,\nI could hold my Alt key,\n\n534\n00:27:16.655 --> 00:27:21.348\nthen type in 0169,\nI don't think you even have to let go.\n\n535\n00:27:21.348 --> 00:27:25.490\nYou just tell it to go into Alt, type\nin the code, and it types it right in.\n\n536\n00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:30.004\nSo if you memorize some of these codes,\nso if you're always using the ñ,\n\n537\n00:27:30.004 --> 00:27:33.261\nyou can find the code, and\nthen be able to map it out.\n\n538\n00:27:33.261 --> 00:27:37.638\nOr find that website that goes ahead and\nlists those out for you and\n\n539\n00:27:37.638 --> 00:27:41.172\nyou can make it put in\nthese different symbols.\n\n540\n00:27:41.172 --> 00:27:43.940\nI double-clicked on it and\nnoticed that it did insert it.\n\n541\n00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:47.880\nThat's one thing, if it's here and\nyou just click Insert, you're like,\n\n542\n00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.330\nit's not doing anything, and\nthen you close and you're like, well, now,\n\n543\n00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:51.566\nI have a bunch of those.\n\n544\n00:27:51.566 --> 00:27:56.321\n[LAUGH] One other one that you might see,\njust to kinda end,\n\n545\n00:27:56.321 --> 00:27:59.120\nI've talked about the %20 for the space.\n\n546\n00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.290\nThere's also something known\nas a non-breaking space.\n\n547\n00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:04.450\nIf I hit the space bar, space, space,\n\n548\n00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:08.960\nspace, space, you can see little dots\nwhere it's just indicating a space.\n\n549\n00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.280\nLet's see if I can remember the shortcut,\nyep, there it is.\n\n550\n00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.912\nAnd let me zoom in so you can see-\n&gt;&gt; Share with the whole class, Vonne.\n\n551\n00:28:15.912 --> 00:28:18.790\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Have you ever seen those, Daniel?\n\n552\n00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:21.404\nWell, I don't know how many times-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've never seen this now.\n\n553\n00:28:21.404 --> 00:28:26.340\n&gt;&gt; Okay, because I always\nhave my show hide characters.\n\n554\n00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:31.150\nI work in a Macintosh and\na PC environment.\n\n555\n00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:34.180\nI work with lots of files from\nlots of different peoples.\n\n556\n00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:38.880\nI see this all the time,\nespecially in tables, and\n\n557\n00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.860\nwhere they've copied it from some website.\n\n558\n00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:46.507\nIt's usually from websites, because\na lot of times when you're talking about\n\n559\n00:28:46.507 --> 00:28:49.428\ncoding for web pages,\nyou can only hit one space.\n\n560\n00:28:49.428 --> 00:28:51.948\nIt will only render, but let me back up.\n\n561\n00:28:51.948 --> 00:28:53.604\nYou can hit the space bar\nas many times as you want.\n\n562\n00:28:53.604 --> 00:28:57.857\nBut in HTML coding, it will only render\non the screen as one single space,\n\n563\n00:28:57.857 --> 00:29:00.930\neven if you have 15 of them in your code.\n\n564\n00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:04.640\nBut to force the space over, talking\nabout these non-printing characters,\n\n565\n00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.237\nyou have to do what's known\nas a non-printing space.\n\n566\n00:29:07.237 --> 00:29:12.940\nA non-breaking space is\nShift+ Ctrl+Space bar, and you see this.\n\n567\n00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:17.380\nSo I've gotten documents from people,\nespecially since I do a lot of designing,\n\n568\n00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.790\nlike, here, here's all our information.\n\n569\n00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:20.691\nNow make it pretty into a nice flier or\nwhatever.\n\n570\n00:29:20.691 --> 00:29:24.988\nI go ahead and get the text, and\nI see all of this cuz they've copied it.\n\n571\n00:29:24.988 --> 00:29:27.272\nAnd so I have to come in here and\nsay, nope,\n\n572\n00:29:27.272 --> 00:29:29.435\nget the non-breaking spaces out of it.\n\n573\n00:29:29.435 --> 00:29:34.681\nI don't want that, because it's not going\nto render, or do what I want it to do.\n\n574\n00:29:34.681 --> 00:29:37.060\nSo I have to pull it all out.\n\n575\n00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:41.700\nBut if I didn't know that there was a\nbutton in Word that would even allow me to\n\n576\n00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:45.750\nsee that, you're like,\nit just will not stop moving over.\n\n577\n00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.390\nWhy does it keep moving over?\n\n578\n00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:49.240\nYou probably have those in there.\n\n579\n00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.240\nOr you might have a line break,\nor a tab, or a section,\n\n580\n00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.830\nor all those different things.\n\n581\n00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:56.420\nIt is like,\nto me it's like the Holy Grail.\n\n582\n00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:56.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n583\n00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:57.994\n&gt;&gt; Why is Word doing this?\n\n584\n00:29:57.994 --> 00:29:59.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n585\n00:29:59.060 --> 00:29:59.968\n&gt;&gt; That's why.\n\n586\n00:29:59.968 --> 00:30:04.594\nThere's a whole world of special\ncharacters and non-printing characters\n\n587\n00:30:04.594 --> 00:30:09.506\nthat is telling your document what to do\nall based on our ASCII, and our Unicode,\n\n588\n00:30:09.506 --> 00:30:12.280\nand so, keep that button in your mind.\n\n589\n00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.490\nAlways turn it on.\n\n590\n00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:15.760\nLove that button, and it will love you.\n\n591\n00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.905\n&gt;&gt; Now I understand why in the world these\nfunky backwards ps have been showing up.\n\n592\n00:30:19.905 --> 00:30:21.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I used to get calls\n\n593\n00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:22.760\nabout this all the time.\n\n594\n00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.720\nWhy is this weird backwards p showing up?\n\n595\n00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.950\nThey were turning this on.\n\n596\n00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:27.240\nSo and now we know.\n\n597\n00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.599\nIt's actually a useful function, and\n\n598\n00:30:28.599 --> 00:30:30.959\nnot just there to irritate people\nthat don't know what it is [LAUGH].\n\n599\n00:30:30.959 --> 00:30:32.655\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly [LAUGH].\n\n600\n00:30:32.655 --> 00:30:34.190\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff, though, Vonne.\n\n601\n00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:37.600\nYou did a great job of showing us why\nthe characters that we use are there,\n\n602\n00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:42.630\nhow they're displayed, how characters that\naren't displayed are actually still there,\n\n603\n00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.720\nand why they are there and\nwhere they come from.\n\n604\n00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.010\nAnd a little bit of back story,\n\n605\n00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:48.470\nwhich was a lot of fun to go\ndown memory lane as well.\n\n606\n00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:49.442\nWe do thank you for that.\n\n607\n00:30:49.442 --> 00:30:52.050\nBut Vonne, it looks like we\nare out of time for this episode.\n\n608\n00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:53.740\nWe do thank you all for watching as well.\n\n609\n00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.760\nSigning off for Office Pro TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n610\n00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.420\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n611\n00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.088\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n612\n00:30:59.088 --> 00:31:04.099\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:14.460\nYou're watching the Microsoft Word\n2016 advance show.\n\n4\n00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.150\nI'm you're host Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.590\nAnd today, we're going to be diving\ninto well, actually images here, right?\n\n6\n00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.640\nAdding in, doing some basic imaging,\n\n7\n00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.420\nas well as some advanced imaging, and here\nto help us out is going to be, of course,\n\n8\n00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.480\nour office pro superstar herself,\nMiss Vonne Smith.\n\n9\n00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.780\nVonne, welcome back to

images.\n\n13\n00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.735\nOne of my favorite subjects.\n\n14\n00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:41.910\nIt's probably next to topography and Word\nand Excel and PowerPoint and Photoshop.\n\n15\n00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.780\nSo its there in the gamut.\n\n16\n00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.580\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of kicking down\nthe line here a little bit.\n\n17\n00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.820\nBut no, images are very important for\nour docs, aren't they?\n\n18\n00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.335\n&gt;&gt; Yes, they are.\n\n19\n00:00:50.335 --> 00:00:53.595\nSo this is ways that we can\nenhance our word files.\n\n20\n00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:56.175\nNow sometimes yo might not need pictures.\n\n21\n00:00:56.175 --> 00:01:00.035\nBut a lot of times it helps\npaint a picture, tell a story.\n\n22\n00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:01.695\nYou know, talking about bunnies?\n\n23\n00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:03.665\nWhy don't you throw a picture\nof a bunny in there, right?\n\n24\n00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:06.955\nIf you have a thing about cats,\nthrow a picture about cats.\n\n25\n00:01:06.955 --> 00:01:09.415\nSo guess what all our images\nare going to be about?\n\n26\n00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:11.195\n&gt;&gt; Bunnies and cats, I'm assuming.\n\n27\n00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:12.155\n&gt;&gt; You are correct.\n\n28\n00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:13.065\n&gt;&gt; Well I am a genius.\n\n29\n00:01:13.065 --> 00:01:14.340\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So-\n\n30\n00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.860\n&gt;&gt; You are extremely genius, Ronnie.\n\n31\n00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.925\n&gt;&gt; I do know the obvious.\n\n32\n00:01:17.925 --> 00:01:19.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can do that.\n\n33\n00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.760\nAll right, so Vonne,\nwe start taking a look in,\n\n34\n00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.750\nat the pictures in the basic course, we\nprobably went over some basic of imaging.\n\n35\n00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.070\nWhat are we taking a look at here?\n\n36\n00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.760\n&gt;&gt; Actually in the words essential,\nwe didn't do anything within there.\n\n37\n00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.760\n&gt;&gt; Mostly I'm lying to you.\n\n38\n00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We were there at the end and\nso.\n\n39\n00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that’s right.\n\n40\n00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.970\n&gt;&gt; And at the beginning of this is but yes\nwe're going to start at the beginning and\n\n41\n00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.560\ntalk about images.\n\n42\n00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.540\nAnd this particular episode we're just\ngoing to learn like the file types and\n\n43\n00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.170\nwhat is that resolution, PPI, because\nthese are things that, what I love to talk\n\n44\n00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.160\nabout and two, it’s just kind of that\nbase knowledge to have in the background.\n\n45\n00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.650\nWhile you're not necessarily going\nto become a graphic artist or\n\n46\n00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.530\na graphic designer from just this one\nepisode and in word as a product,\n\n47\n00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.700\nits a word processing program,\n\n48\n00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.000\nit's not a graphics manipulation\ntype product, its not Photoshop.\n\n49\n00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.930\nSo, it can't do all those things that\nthose other products can do, but\n\n50\n00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.420\nit actually can do a lot of it.\n\n51\n00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.260\nBut having,\n\n52\n00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.160\nat least, a base knowledge of what's\nthe difference between a JPEG and a GIF?\n\n53\n00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.810\nThat can really help you just\nfind those little things,\n\n54\n00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.880\nis like,\nthat's why that thing is doing that.\n\n55\n00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.730\nWhy do I have a white background?\n\n56\n00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.870\nOkay, now that always\nleads to the question of,\n\n57\n00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.880\nwell then how can I change it?\n\n58\n00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.200\nWell, there are some things\nthat we can do in Word, but\n\n59\n00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.110\nit would require you going on to\na different type of product that would be\n\n60\n00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.240\nable to do those types of things,\nlike Photoshop or even Paint.\n\n61\n00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.540\n&gt;&gt; Paint?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm actually going to\n\n62\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.060\nshow you a little thing to do-\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n63\n00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.760\n&gt;&gt; in Paint today.\n\n64\n00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.091\nGood old Paint in the operating system.\n\n65\n00:02:44.091 --> 00:02:44.706\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n66\n00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:47.838\nI have a PowerPoint presentation\nthat I have ready on my computer, so\n\n67\n00:02:47.838 --> 00:02:50.070\nlet's go ahead and get into this.\n\n68\n00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.005\nNow I don't really necessarily\nneed to run the slide show,\n\n69\n00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.820\nbecause I've got most of\nthe information on here.\n\n70\n00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.150\nAnd so I took this actually\nfrom my PowerPoint show,\n\n71\n00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.258\nmodified it a little bit to just\nkind of cover all the basics.\n\n72\n00:03:01.258 --> 00:03:07.290\nSo file yypes, we talk about file, I love\nto talk about file types but we kind of,\n\n73\n00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.620\nI don't want to say take it for granted\nbut its just like, there is a picture,\n\n74\n00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.850\ntake a picture with my camera or phone and\nthen I have it and then I send it to\n\n75\n00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.960\npeople, and I share it and I get pictures,\nand you think a picture's a picture.\n\n76\n00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.660\nKind of, but we've always been\ntalking about languages right?\n\n77\n00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.810\nWord talks in Word, Excel talks in Excel,\nfile types and whether it's ,docx or .doc.\n\n78\n00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.240\nWhat does that mean?\n\n79\n00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.440\nImages are the same way,\n\n80\n00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.800\nand when you're talking about pictures,\nyou're talking about raster information.\n\n81\n00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.550\nAll of photographs are made up of pixels.\n\n82\n00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.590\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So pixels that are in some sort of\n\n83\n00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.280\ngrid formation that goes ahead and\nmakes all of the colors and\n\n84\n00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.202\nthe things that we see on our screen.\n\n85\n00:03:50.202 --> 00:03:54.100\nWell of the different types that we have,\nJPEG\n\n86\n00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.660\nprobably would be the most common file\ntype that most people are familiar with,\n\n87\n00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.800\nbecause it's the most common for\njust regular photographs.\n\n88\n00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.150\nBecause it's that pixel\ninformation that's in there and\n\n89\n00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.030\nit has a lot of color support in\nthat particular file format and\n\n90\n00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.800\nthe other thing that I don't have on this\nslide, is that it uses compression to\n\n91\n00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.970\nstore the file, so it doesn't take\nas much room on our computer.\n\n92\n00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.730\nThat's the other thing we will talk\nabout as long with file types talk about\n\n93\n00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.220\nresolution and overall document\ndimensions or image dimensions.\n\n94\n00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.240\nThat makes a huge deal.\n\n95\n00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.300\nSo, our photos, and our pictures that we\ntake with our cameras, normally takes them\n\n96\n00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.750\nat a higher resolution, to be able to\ntransport it, and do whatever you want.\n\n97\n00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.370\nBut, I'm starting to get\na little bit ahead of myself.\n\n98\n00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.160\nBut, it's because I'm starting\nto blend them together.\n\n99\n00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.010\nSo, let's just stick with file types.\n\n100\n00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.990\nBut, JPEGs, that's the one you're going\nto be probably, most familiar with.\n\n101\n00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.650\nDo you know what jpg stands for, Ronnie?\n\n102\n00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.240\n&gt;&gt; I used to know, but\nI cannot tell you right now [LAUGH].\n\n103\n00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.150\n&gt;&gt; It is the joint\nphotographic experts group.\n\n104\n00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.870\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n105\n00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.300\n&gt;&gt; And while we see JPG, you actually\nhave the four letter extension as well,\n\n106\n00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.750\nwhich is JPEG, and it was just\na group of people that went ahead and\n\n107\n00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.650\ncreated this particular file format,\naround 1987 is what I saw on\n\n108\n00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.870\nWikipedia there, and it was a group that\nwent, and it talks about ISO standards.\n\n109\n00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.960\nThings that you know about\nin like the tech world and\n\n110\n00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.530\nstuff, so\nthat's where it kind of came around.\n\n111\n00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.510\nAnd then there is another file\nformat called the gif file format.\n\n112\n00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.150\nDo you know what that stands for?\n\n113\n00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.270\n&gt;&gt; Graphics image format?\n\n114\n00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, pretty much, yeah, yeah.\n\n115\n00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.220\nGraphics image format.\n\n116\n00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.040\nSo that's the one that we had and\nit was created by a man named\n\n117\n00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.020\nSteve Willhite back in 1987,\nand also under CompuServe,\n\n118\n00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.230\nso just to let you know\na little bit of history.\n\n119\n00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.090\nAnd the GIF file format is where\nit only has so much color support.\n\n120\n00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.480\nIt's a small area, I believe it has 256\namount of colors that can be stored\n\n121\n00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.330\nin a .gif, versus I think 65,536 of .jpg\nand I actually think it's a lot more.\n\n122\n00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:08.760\nI think that's the next binary increment,\ntwo to the power of sixteen or whatever.\n\n123\n00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.390\nBut .gifs have a smaller color support,\nbut\n\n124\n00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:14.610\nit also supports transparency,\nas you can see, jpgs don't.\n\n125\n00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.700\nThis is one that was\nalways that ha moment for\n\n126\n00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.090\npeople, like like\nthe white box that you get.\n\n127\n00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.590\nAnd actually here I have it on\nthe next slide, this, where\n\n128\n00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.280\nsometimes you might get a photograph,\nor what you think is a photograph.\n\n129\n00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.468\nWell I guess, because it is, it's pixels.\n\n130\n00:06:30.468 --> 00:06:33.810\nIn a .gif,\nyou don't see anything around it,\n\n131\n00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.760\nit's got transparency, as opposed\nto a .jpg that gets the white box,\n\n132\n00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.630\nand that's what, yeah, I know what that\nwhite box thing is because that particular\n\n133\n00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.010\nfile format can't support transparency,\nbut GIF can.\n\n134\n00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.140\nSo that's was where I was like that's\nthe nice kind of differences between it.\n\n135\n00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.000\nNow, [LAUGH] just for\nanother little history lesson.\n\n136\n00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.780\nI pronounce it GIF.\n\n137\n00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.540\nDo you pronounce it GIF?\n\n138\n00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.800\n&gt;&gt; Probably, I pronounce it GIF as well.\n\n139\n00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.740\nWell, it's funny when the creator of this\nfile format was awarded the Webby and\n\n140\n00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.090\nI can't remember what year it was.\n\n141\n00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.970\nAnd he went up to accept the award\nof a Lifetime Achievement Award and\n\n142\n00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.930\nhe put in a tiny, in a GIF-\n&gt;&gt; JIF.\n\n143\n00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.930\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nIt's not pronounced gif,\n\n144\n00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.210\nit's jif, like with a j.\n\n145\n00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.700\nAnd it was something in\nreferences to peanut butter,\n\n146\n00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.402\nlike choosy moms choose Jif like\nchoosy computer people choose JIFs.\n\n147\n00:07:28.402 --> 00:07:29.044\n&gt;&gt; JIFs.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n148\n00:07:29.044 --> 00:07:31.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Now that's from Wikipedia.\n\n149\n00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.340\nThat's where I read it, but\nI had always heard about it.\n\n150\n00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.055\nAnd it was this big\ncontroversy on the Internet.\n\n151\n00:07:38.055 --> 00:07:39.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which one is it?\n\n152\n00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.920\nAnd so the creator of the file\nformat said, no, it's this.\n\n153\n00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.300\nSo I thought that was fun.\n\n154\n00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.700\nSome other file formats that came along.\n\n155\n00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.270\nWe have the ping or the png.\n\n156\n00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.545\nThat's portable network graphic.\n\n157\n00:07:52.545 --> 00:07:53.556\nMm-hm.\n\n158\n00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:57.181\nNow this is the one where it's kind\nof like the best of both worlds.\n\n159\n00:07:57.181 --> 00:08:00.441\nIt acts like a jpeg with that\nlarge color support, but\n\n160\n00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:04.652\nit also acts like a GIF where it goes\nahead and has that transparency.\n\n161\n00:08:04.652 --> 00:08:09.440\nAnd even more than the GIF,\nit supports multi-level transparency.\n\n162\n00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.010\nAnd has an 8-bit transparency\nrather than a 1-bit transparency.\n\n163\n00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.459\nIt's like what is what?\n\n164\n00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:15.650\nWell, you're talking about bits now.\n\n165\n00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:19.180\n1-bit transparency,\nit's either transparent or it's not.\n\n166\n00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.892\nThere's no variance in between.\n\n167\n00:08:20.892 --> 00:08:25.250\nWith an 8-bit transparency you could\nhave varying levels of transparency.\n\n168\n00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.010\nBack on this you see\nthat this PNG right here,\n\n169\n00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.620\nit has a drop shadow and transparency.\n\n170\n00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.020\nYou couldn't have that with a GIF.\n\n171\n00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.681\nIt's either on or off.\n\n172\n00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:37.329\nSo it's either white or\nback or really it's on or off.\n\n173\n00:08:37.329 --> 00:08:38.310\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n174\n00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:41.260\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat's what happened with the PNG file or\n\n175\n00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.821\nthe PNG is I just kind of took that out.\n\n176\n00:08:43.821 --> 00:08:47.786\nThat actually was created,\nmy Wikipedia said,\n\n177\n00:08:47.786 --> 00:08:52.330\nit's not my, the Wikipedia,\nsaid around 1996 and\n\n178\n00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:57.370\nit lists multiple authors as\nthe creators of the file format.\n\n179\n00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.300\nSo it wasn't just one particular person or\none company that did it.\n\n180\n00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.696\nAnd that's the one you see a lot when\nyou're working with Office products,\n\n181\n00:09:05.696 --> 00:09:08.784\nif you go to,\nwhen we insert images of online images,\n\n182\n00:09:08.784 --> 00:09:11.269\na lot of them are in\nthat .png file format.\n\n183\n00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:13.976\nSo you're seeing that\na little bit more often,\n\n184\n00:09:13.976 --> 00:09:17.836\nat least I have through all these\nyears of working with computers and\n\n185\n00:09:17.836 --> 00:09:21.376\nworking in computer graphics,\nthe .png has come a long way.\n\n186\n00:09:21.376 --> 00:09:23.180\nThen you have the .tiff file format.\n\n187\n00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.320\nWell, that is tagged image file format.\n\n188\n00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.564\nAnd when you type it in\nto your Google search,\n\n189\n00:09:28.564 --> 00:09:31.232\nit also is\nthe Toronto International Film Festival.\n\n190\n00:09:31.232 --> 00:09:34.220\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.\n\n191\n00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:38.257\nNow this file format was created in around\n\n192\n00:09:38.257 --> 00:09:43.840\n1986 by the company called Aldus,\nwhich is actually now Adobe.\n\n193\n00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.150\nAdobe bought that company.\n\n194\n00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.360\nSo, and\nit is very much embedded into print type,\n\n195\n00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.440\nlike printing on a piece of paper.\n\n196\n00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.450\nBecause it has no compression in a tiff,\nand\n\n197\n00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:59.400\nactually the type of compression that it\nwould have if it has it is an LZW which is\n\n198\n00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.700\na lossless compression as opposed\nto a lossy compression in the JPEG.\n\n199\n00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.601\nIf it says that's a little too high,\njust go, sounds great.\n\n200\n00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:07.572\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n201\n00:10:07.572 --> 00:10:09.420\n&gt;&gt; But it's the way that where your\n\n202\n00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.930\nimages will print properly and\nit doesn't lose any information.\n\n203\n00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.380\nIt's also a way to try to get out,\n\n204\n00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:20.570\nI was reading about to try to make all\nthe scanners and all those print devices\n\n205\n00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:24.380\ntalking that same file format in\nthe sense to go ahead and get it all.\n\n206\n00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:29.960\nSo, tag image file format is where\nyou get that particular file format.\n\n207\n00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.630\nSo it comes from print.\n\n208\n00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.931\nLike I said right in here, and the one\nbehind my head, that's a .TIFF too.\n\n209\n00:10:34.931 --> 00:10:39.656\nYou can see that these are the different\ntypes of file formats that you might\n\n210\n00:10:39.656 --> 00:10:43.130\nencounter from time to time\nwhen working with images.\n\n211\n00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:47.720\nAll right, image size is another\none I could talk forever about, but\n\n212\n00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.100\nkeeping it short right in here,\nresolution.\n\n213\n00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.330\nNow, Ronnie, I know we've had this\ndiscussion before, and you know about.\n\n214\n00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.490\nBut when you hear the word resolution,\nin general terms,\n\n215\n00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.330\nwhat do you normally\njust equate that with?\n\n216\n00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.420\n&gt;&gt; I equate that with the viewable area.\n\n217\n00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.740\n&gt;&gt; Okay, what about qualitied?\n\n218\n00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.860\nIs that another word that\nmaybe comes into mind?\n\n219\n00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.930\n&gt;&gt; It does, the higher the resolution,\nthe better quality.\n\n220\n00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:12.369\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, especially with nowadays,\nall of our HDTVs and\n\n221\n00:11:12.369 --> 00:11:14.462\nif you have a higher resolution,\n\n222\n00:11:14.462 --> 00:11:19.653\nthat's what I always equate it to cuz they\nreally talk about this in televisions.\n\n223\n00:11:19.653 --> 00:11:23.110\nAnd when you're buying those types\nof devices and everything is bigger.\n\n224\n00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.515\nSo yes, the bigger the better.\n\n225\n00:11:24.515 --> 00:11:30.152\nAnd that is normally true if we're\ntalking about those particular devices or\n\n226\n00:11:30.152 --> 00:11:32.140\nhigher quality.\n\n227\n00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.550\nBut when we're talking about images,\n\n228\n00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:38.870\nspecifically, resolution is not\nalways the quality and clarity.\n\n229\n00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.790\nIt technically means pixels per inch.\n\n230\n00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:46.972\nHow many pixels per inch are in a file?\n\n231\n00:11:46.972 --> 00:11:49.662\nThe other thing to think about,\nthough, if we talk about inches,\n\n232\n00:11:49.662 --> 00:11:51.236\nwe're usually talking about paper.\n\n233\n00:11:51.236 --> 00:11:53.835\n&gt;&gt; Paper.\n&gt;&gt; We're not talking about screens\n\n234\n00:11:53.835 --> 00:11:54.890\nnecessarily.\n\n235\n00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.532\nSo that's where you get this\nwhole differentiation of how\n\n236\n00:11:59.532 --> 00:12:01.528\nmuch resolution I need.\n\n237\n00:12:01.528 --> 00:12:04.151\nAnd, have you ever encountered\nsomething like this over here on\n\n238\n00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:05.410\nthe right-hand side?\n\n239\n00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.740\nWhere you've taken a picture, you've\nmade it bigger and it does this, Ronnie?\n\n240\n00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.089\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I do that on purpose\nwith my images on Facebook.\n\n241\n00:12:12.089 --> 00:12:16.463\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well, this is where you\nhad a file that a lot of times people\n\n242\n00:12:16.463 --> 00:12:20.439\nthink is a lower resolution,\nwhich is, it could be true.\n\n243\n00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:22.768\nBut let me kind of throw\na wrench in there.\n\n244\n00:12:22.768 --> 00:12:25.200\nIt's not always about resolution, okay.\n\n245\n00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.620\nIt's really more about\nthe pixel dimensions.\n\n246\n00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.450\nAnd that's why I have\nresolution pixel dimensions.\n\n247\n00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.861\nWhile they work together,\nbecause how many,\n\n248\n00:12:33.861 --> 00:12:37.888\nif I have a file that is\n600 pixels by 400 pixels.\n\n249\n00:12:37.888 --> 00:12:42.930\nBecause photographs are in pixels,\nthat's what they live in.\n\n250\n00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:50.776\nBut the resolution, I could have a 600 by\n400 image that is a 300 ppi or a 72 ppi.\n\n251\n00:12:50.776 --> 00:12:54.028\nBut they're still 600 by 400 pixels.\n\n252\n00:12:54.028 --> 00:12:57.076\nThe amount of pixels hasn't changed.\n\n253\n00:12:57.076 --> 00:13:00.964\nIt really just depends on what\ndevice that I'm going to be making\n\n254\n00:13:00.964 --> 00:13:02.680\nthat go to if you wanna say.\n\n255\n00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.022\nWhere is it's final space?\n\n256\n00:13:05.022 --> 00:13:07.940\nAnd this is something like in\nprint that's really important.\n\n257\n00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.471\nAnd when I talk about print in this way,\nI'm talking about commercial printing,\n\n258\n00:13:11.471 --> 00:13:14.900\nlike you're sending this off to a print\nprovider that's gonna be printing this\n\n259\n00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:15.735\ninformation out.\n\n260\n00:13:15.735 --> 00:13:20.930\nSo they usually tell you,\nnot always, but 300ppi.\n\n261\n00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:24.920\nSo that's kind of the industry\nstandard for commercial printing.\n\n262\n00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.050\nAll of your graphics need to be\nin that particular resolution.\n\n263\n00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:34.835\nSo that way, and if you think about it, if\nthere's more pixels in a square inch, for\n\n264\n00:13:34.835 --> 00:13:40.395\nyou to be able to have a larger image on a\npiece of paper to be 5 inches by 4 inches.\n\n265\n00:13:40.395 --> 00:13:45.936\nYou're gonna need to have a lot more total\npixels to be able to get it to that size.\n\n266\n00:13:45.936 --> 00:13:49.258\nAnd so that's where all of\nyour cameras and phones,\n\n267\n00:13:49.258 --> 00:13:52.460\nit takes it at a much\nhigher pixel dimension.\n\n268\n00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.090\nSo that way,\nwhen you make the resolution bigger,\n\n269\n00:13:55.090 --> 00:14:00.600\nthen the overall document size in its\nprinted format would get smaller.\n\n270\n00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.710\nThe total number of pixels stay the same,\n\n271\n00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.720\nit's just that everything\njust kind of squashes down.\n\n272\n00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.820\nSo that's where you get the whole\nidea of having resolution.\n\n273\n00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.920\nAnd this is where somebody, or\nif you've got a picture and\n\n274\n00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.760\nyou try to make it bigger, and\nyou're like, that didn't work.\n\n275\n00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:18.693\nAnd a lot of people would ask like hey,\ndo you have a higher resolution graphic?\n\n276\n00:14:18.693 --> 00:14:21.758\nIt also really is do you have\na file that has more pixels?\n\n277\n00:14:21.758 --> 00:14:22.319\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n278\n00:14:22.319 --> 00:14:23.480\n&gt;&gt; Has more pixels.\n\n279\n00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.560\nAnd the idea with our computers,\n\n280\n00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.100\nnot all the programs are good\nat making more pixels.\n\n281\n00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.953\nSo it just kinda guesses, and so\n\n282\n00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:34.946\nthat's why sometimes you will have\nthese photographs that you get.\n\n283\n00:14:34.946 --> 00:14:37.610\nYou don't know what the size is, but\nyou're like, okay, I'll throw it in.\n\n284\n00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.313\nYou make it bigger and\nit just starts to not look so good.\n\n285\n00:14:40.313 --> 00:14:41.960\nCuz it just didn't have\nenough to start with.\n\n286\n00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:47.109\nSo it's better to go smaller and\nremove information than it is to try to\n\n287\n00:14:47.109 --> 00:14:52.279\nbe smaller and go bigger and\ncreate information that doesn't exist.\n\n288\n00:14:52.279 --> 00:14:57.871\nSo that's just image size 101-\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n289\n00:14:57.871 --> 00:15:02.078\n&gt;&gt; That all graphic designers and anybody\nthat works in computer graphics, it's like\n\n290\n00:15:02.078 --> 00:15:06.000\nthe be all and end all that you have to\nknow about when you start working with it.\n\n291\n00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.480\nNow, you're in Word, right,\nso you're not going to be\n\n292\n00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.140\nthat deep into graphic design, but\nagain just having that base knowledge.\n\n293\n00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.220\nAnd when we get into things\nthat your computer can do,\n\n294\n00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.960\nor actually I should say Word can do,\nwhen it talks about compressing images.\n\n295\n00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.050\nThese numbers are gonna come up again,\nand so\n\n296\n00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:25.110\nnow you're like,\nI understand what that means.\n\n297\n00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:30.270\nCuz think about it, if I have\na Word file that has 50 images that\n\n298\n00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:33.570\nare 5,000 pixels wide or whatever.\n\n299\n00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.768\nAnd then that's gonna make the overall\ndocument size a lot bigger.\n\n300\n00:15:36.768 --> 00:15:39.700\nSo it's really all about usable space.\n\n301\n00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.140\nAnd I don't really want a 50-meg Word file\n\n302\n00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:48.230\nnecessarily with all of those images if I\ncan start controlling some of that size.\n\n303\n00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:49.381\nSo, throwing that in.\n\n304\n00:15:49.381 --> 00:15:54.336\nNow, back here in our PowerPoint\npresentation, just a few things that we'll\n\n305\n00:15:54.336 --> 00:15:58.539\nbe getting into are what our computer\nprograms can do such as Word or\n\n306\n00:15:58.539 --> 00:16:00.432\nreally Office, I would say.\n\n307\n00:16:00.432 --> 00:16:06.433\nPowerPoint, Excel Where they can\ndo things like put on styles.\n\n308\n00:16:06.433 --> 00:16:09.400\nI can make my pictures\nlook really cute in here.\n\n309\n00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.706\nI can do some color corrections.\n\n310\n00:16:10.706 --> 00:16:13.380\nI can do transparency and\nartistic effects.\n\n311\n00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:17.000\nThere's also the wonderful format\npicture task pane that we can do\n\n312\n00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000\na few more things.\n\n313\n00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.970\nAnd just a couple more examples\nwe'll be getting into cropping.\n\n314\n00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:22.590\nRemoving the background,\n\n315\n00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:24.380\nwhich can be good and-\n&gt;&gt; Challenging.\n\n316\n00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really cool.\n\n317\n00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.470\nIt doesn't always work perfectly,\nbut we'll see that.\n\n318\n00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.780\nAnd then, change picture,\nreset picture and compress picture.\n\n319\n00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.200\nThese are all the things\nthat you're gonna be seeing\n\n320\n00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.858\non the picture format contextual tab,\nwhen we put images into Word.\n\n321\n00:16:37.858 --> 00:16:42.170\nAnd so, that will be in the next episode,\nif you're watching in succession.\n\n322\n00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.440\nWhere we'll format our images.\n\n323\n00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.510\nNow, Pictures.\n\n324\n00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:49.160\nKinda going on that resolution\nof what to identify.\n\n325\n00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:54.700\nWhen I look at these photographs in my\nfile explorer, I just opened up my folder.\n\n326\n00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.030\nAnd I go to my large icons, or\nmaybe like extra large, so you, guys,\n\n327\n00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.260\ncan see it a little bit better.\n\n328\n00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.790\nLike that photograph, this one,\nand then, this one, now\n\n329\n00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:06.220\nthat actually looks a little bit smaller,\nbut those look about the same, don't they?\n\n330\n00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.280\nI mean in the file explorer, let's say.\n\n331\n00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.523\nBut they're not,\nthey're way different in their file size.\n\n332\n00:17:13.523 --> 00:17:18.480\nSo, when you're in your file explorer,\nI don't always like to go to the details.\n\n333\n00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.600\nAnd this is where you can start\nseeing things like, well,\n\n334\n00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.310\nthere's my GIF, there's my JPEG,\nthere's my TIFF, and there's my PNG.\n\n335\n00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.800\nThese are the different types.\n\n336\n00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.950\nAnd other thing that I like to\ndo when I'm in a details view,\n\n337\n00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.950\nis always to turn on the file extensions.\n\n338\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:34.622\nYes, I can see the type column, but\n\n339\n00:17:34.622 --> 00:17:39.170\nI like to see the file\nextension in my files.\n\n340\n00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:43.024\nI wanna know which one is this,\nbecause I have flower, flower, flower,\n\n341\n00:17:43.024 --> 00:17:43.904\nflower shadow.\n\n342\n00:17:43.904 --> 00:17:46.469\nThree photographs that are names the same,\nbut they're not the same,\n\n343\n00:17:46.469 --> 00:17:48.690\nbecause they're in different file formats.\n\n344\n00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:52.640\nAnd that was like if I go back to those\nicons, they all kind of look the same,\n\n345\n00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.450\nbut they really aren't.\n\n346\n00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:58.240\nAnd a GIF, because that's just windows\ntrying to show you transparency.\n\n347\n00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.470\nKind of back over the details.\n\n348\n00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.980\nYou can see the size,\n\n349\n00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:07.070\nthat's like the amount of the information\nthat it is holding, and so, you could\n\n350\n00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:11.570\nsee that this particular file right here,\nthat's about what I got two mega bytes?\n\n351\n00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:17.100\nCuz we have two, yeah, 2,000 kilobytes,\nthe other thing that I like to do,\n\n352\n00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:21.580\nsince I need to know what those dimensions\nare, is throwing in another column, and\n\n353\n00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.040\nthere's this button right here\nwhere it says, add columns.\n\n354\n00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.060\nYou could also right click up\nin any of the column's headings\n\n355\n00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.040\nto get to the dimensions.\n\n356\n00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:34.111\nI want to see, cuz remember I said,\nthe pixel dimensions, those are important.\n\n357\n00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:38.710\nSo, I can tell right here with our bish,\nthat's what we name him.\n\n358\n00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:40.872\nWell, his name is Bishop, but\nwe call him Bish-Bish a lot.\n\n359\n00:18:40.872 --> 00:18:45.608\nSo, Bishop, I have it as 480 by 640,\n\n360\n00:18:45.608 --> 00:18:49.200\n240 by 320, 60 by 80.\n\n361\n00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.930\nThat was why you get this picture.\n\n362\n00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.540\nHere's this cute little picture I put\ninto a document trying to make it bigger.\n\n363\n00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.780\nIt's, that's not gonna work.\n\n364\n00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.900\nBut if I had a photograph like this one.\n\n365\n00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.177\nLook at that,\n3,000 pixels by 4,000 pixels.\n\n366\n00:19:02.177 --> 00:19:04.460\nThat's a lot of room to work with.\n\n367\n00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.910\nSo, if I needed to have a nice high\nquality graphic, as Gloria said,\n\n368\n00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.560\ngo on the cover of my word document.\n\n369\n00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.620\nLike the first page,\nlike a big old picture of Fuego.\n\n370\n00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.130\nIt'd be good to go ahead and\nhave a photograph in this size.\n\n371\n00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:19.490\nIf this is the file size that I was sent.\n\n372\n00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.766\nLike somebody gave me this file, and\nthis is what I need to put on the cover,\n\n373\n00:19:22.766 --> 00:19:23.339\nreally big.\n\n374\n00:19:23.339 --> 00:19:26.320\nI'm going to make it really big and\nit's not going to look good.\n\n375\n00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:31.140\nSo, making sure you have that\nfoundational understanding of,\n\n376\n00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.290\npixel dimensions, file types.\n\n377\n00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:36.119\nWhether it has transparency,\nor not transparency.\n\n378\n00:19:36.119 --> 00:19:37.630\nWhat am I working with?\n\n379\n00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:41.904\nAnd can I do what I want\nto do with these graphics?\n\n380\n00:19:41.904 --> 00:19:46.540\nNow, a lot of times you get big pictures,\nand that starts taking a lot of space up.\n\n381\n00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:51.760\nSo, let me come back over to our icons,\njust so, I can see what they look like.\n\n382\n00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.190\nSo, I have this picture right\nhere of Fuego in a tree.\n\n383\n00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:54.840\nI'm just going to open it.\n\n384\n00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.650\nIt's going to open up in a photo,\nso you can see it.\n\n385\n00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:00.466\nHe's just such a regal-looking\nmountain lion, isn't he?, [LAUGH].\n\n386\n00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:01.487\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n387\n00:20:01.487 --> 00:20:06.086\n&gt;&gt; So, this is a picture, but it's really,\nreally big, and if I hover over it,\n\n388\n00:20:06.086 --> 00:20:10.070\nthat's that 2000, by 3000,\nand more types of stuff.\n\n389\n00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:11.753\nWell, I wanna make this smaller,\n\n390\n00:20:11.753 --> 00:20:13.633\nbecause it's just kind of,-\n&gt;&gt; Big.\n\n391\n00:20:13.633 --> 00:20:14.815\n&gt;&gt; It's just too big.\n\n392\n00:20:14.815 --> 00:20:19.354\nReally easy way to do this, is if you,\nI like to right-click on this, and\n\n393\n00:20:19.354 --> 00:20:20.609\nopen it with Paint.\n\n394\n00:20:20.609 --> 00:20:24.399\nNow, you can always go to Paint,\nopen the file, because a very easy way,\n\n395\n00:20:24.399 --> 00:20:29.520\nit's like whoa, I don't even know what's\ngoing on here, because it's so big.\n\n396\n00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.208\nYou can use the resize button\nto make files smaller.\n\n397\n00:20:33.208 --> 00:20:38.440\nBecause it might be easier to work\nwith files that are 1200 pixels,\n\n398\n00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.330\nor maybe 800 pixels wide.\n\n399\n00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:44.290\nAnd that way,\nyou have a big resolution one, and, well,\n\n400\n00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:48.850\nbig pixel dimension ones, and one that is\nsmaller, because you don't want to have so\n\n401\n00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:53.710\nmuch room being taken\nup by that file size.\n\n402\n00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:58.320\nWithin your Word document, or Excel,\nor PowerPoint, and so on and so forth.\n\n403\n00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.252\nSo, on the Home you can go to Resize,\nand I usually just do percentages,\n\n404\n00:21:02.252 --> 00:21:03.290\ncuz it's easier.\n\n405\n00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:08.290\nLet's make that 25%, and notice it does\nboth, cuz it keeps the aspect ratio.\n\n406\n00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:12.911\nYou click OK, and then,\ndown here on the status bar, now,\n\n407\n00:21:12.911 --> 00:21:15.830\nthat's 600 by 800-ish pixels.\n\n408\n00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.658\nThat's a lot easier to work with,\n\n409\n00:21:17.658 --> 00:21:22.420\nthat's gonna make it a lot smaller when\nI start working with this photograph.\n\n410\n00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.560\nNow, this is where that File Save and\nFile Save As is gonna be really important.\n\n411\n00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.530\nI always say, keep a copy of the big one.\n\n412\n00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:33.380\nThat one that you can always go\nback to and do things off of it.\n\n413\n00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:38.420\nSo, I would do a File Save As, also has\nthose different file formats that we now\n\n414\n00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.360\nknow a little bit more about,\nwhich should make some good stuff.\n\n415\n00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.870\nPaint actually does a lot of other things,\nand you can try to like remove\n\n416\n00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:49.410\nthe background, and then, saving it in one\nof these file formats would be important\n\n417\n00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:52.590\nto understand, don't save it as a JPEG,\ncuz it's gonna make a white background.\n\n418\n00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.260\nIt's just the way it is.\n\n419\n00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:58.155\nI will save this is a JPEG and\nI'll name this Fuego.\n\n420\n00:21:58.155 --> 00:22:03.018\nLet's go ahead and\nuse the right letters Fuego smaller.\n\n421\n00:22:03.018 --> 00:22:08.492\nAnd now, I have a Fuego smaller coming\nin to here, if I go onto this details.\n\n422\n00:22:08.492 --> 00:22:14.490\nSo, Fuego smaller way different file\nsize that the one that we started with.\n\n423\n00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:16.620\nSo, very easy to do.\n\n424\n00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:21.240\nIn Paint to just resize those larger\ngraphics to make it a little easier.\n\n425\n00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:26.580\nAll right, so now, that we have a very\nbasic understanding of file types and\n\n426\n00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:30.330\nimage size, let's go ahead and\nhow do I put this into Word?\n\n427\n00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.690\nHow do I get an image in my Word document?\n\n428\n00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:34.916\nLet's start up Word.\n\n429\n00:22:34.916 --> 00:22:38.744\nWe're just going to start with a blank\ndocument, because this is the last part of\n\n430\n00:22:38.744 --> 00:22:42.741\nthis episode that let's get the pictures\nin there, and then, in the next episode,\n\n431\n00:22:42.741 --> 00:22:46.284\nwe'll talk about what we can do with it,\nhow we can make it look different,\n\n432\n00:22:46.284 --> 00:22:48.490\nhow we can move it around\nwithin my document.\n\n433\n00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:51.280\nSo, we'll insert, then we'll format next.\n\n434\n00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.714\nBasic document is fine.\n\n435\n00:22:53.714 --> 00:22:55.830\nAnd you have my show high characters.\n\n436\n00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.860\nCuz one thing to consider, just right now.\n\n437\n00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.416\nWe'll explore this more.\n\n438\n00:22:59.416 --> 00:23:03.853\nAn image is just like any type of\ncontent that you put into Word,\n\n439\n00:23:03.853 --> 00:23:06.635\nwhich is normally [LAUGH] well, words.\n\n440\n00:23:06.635 --> 00:23:11.700\n&gt;&gt; It's like characters, they're in\nparagraphs, so putting images in\n\n441\n00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.840\nyour paragraphs, and treating the as\nparagraphs is going to be very important.\n\n442\n00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.979\nI want an image between this paragraph and\nthis paragraph,\n\n443\n00:23:18.979 --> 00:23:21.677\nput it enter,\nmake another paragraph, and then,\n\n444\n00:23:21.677 --> 00:23:25.786\nput that picture in, and then, we can\nhave some different options in there.\n\n445\n00:23:25.786 --> 00:23:28.700\nDoesn't mean you always have to,\nbut I'll explore that.\n\n446\n00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.770\nAnyways, throwing that in,\npicture, cursor, go to insert,\n\n447\n00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:37.070\nand you have the option of doing\na picture that’s on your computer, so\n\n448\n00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:38.530\nfrom a file that you have.\n\n449\n00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:40.770\nOnline pictures,\n\n450\n00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:44.360\nthis is a cool one of where,\nthis used to be like what insert clip art.\n\n451\n00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.530\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Back in the day, and then,\n\n452\n00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:48.800\nit went out online, and\nstarted finding all kinds of photographs.\n\n453\n00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.697\nWell, now they just say find it online.\n\n454\n00:23:50.697 --> 00:23:53.891\nAnd it brings up all sorts\nof image searches from Bing.\n\n455\n00:23:53.891 --> 00:23:57.827\nAnd then, it does talk about\ncreative common licenses, so\n\n456\n00:23:57.827 --> 00:24:02.642\nbeing a little aware of do you have\nthe authority to use that photograph.\n\n457\n00:24:02.642 --> 00:24:04.972\nThat's something you should\njust be somewhat aware of.\n\n458\n00:24:04.972 --> 00:24:08.850\nThey have a lot of documentation on there\nfor you to go ahead and explore that.\n\n459\n00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:13.240\nAnd then the other one I'm going to cover\nis screenshot, because I love this one.\n\n460\n00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.580\nI do a lot of files with I'm doing\nstep by step instructions and\n\n461\n00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.710\nsaying click on this button.\n\n462\n00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:22.740\nSo taking a screenshot right from\nwithin your Office products,\n\n463\n00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.959\nit's one of my favorite features.\n\n464\n00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.570\nWe'll start from insert pictures, now\nthat we know what type of fields we have.\n\n465\n00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.560\nI'm gonna come over here to my\npictures folder that's on my desktop.\n\n466\n00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:38.262\nAnd I will pick,\nlet's go with little bish and\n\n467\n00:24:38.262 --> 00:24:43.822\nwe'll take Mr. Bishop,\nsay insert, photo goes in.\n\n468\n00:24:43.822 --> 00:24:45.450\nAnd there it now.\n\n469\n00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.660\nRonnie, actually my\ncomputer updated yesterday.\n\n470\n00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.360\nI think we saw it, like it's like hey,\nI need updates, right?\n\n471\n00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.970\nWell, it went ahead and\nupdated Office, too.\n\n472\n00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.940\nAnd one of the new Office things that they\nhad, I don't know if you noticed it right\n\n473\n00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.250\nacross the bottom is that it\nwas showing alternate text.\n\n474\n00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:02.670\nAnd that's just a new feature.\n\n475\n00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:04.312\nThat's the first one I've seen so far.\n\n476\n00:25:04.312 --> 00:25:06.721\n[LAUGH] I know there's probably\nsome more hidden in here, too.\n\n477\n00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:12.750\nVery quickly what alternate text is for\naccessibility for\n\n478\n00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:16.760\npeople that are non-sighted\nwhere you can't see the graphic.\n\n479\n00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.610\nBut if you have things like reading\nyour screen, like screen readers,\n\n480\n00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:26.220\nit will read whatever alternate text\nyou have added to that image to say.\n\n481\n00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:31.730\nCute orange and white cat with\nreindeer antlers at Christmas time.\n\n482\n00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:35.590\nThat would give an accurate description\nof what this file looks like.\n\n483\n00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.910\nSo just to know, I'll show you where\nyou can add alternate text later.\n\n484\n00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:42.100\nAnd that's how I go ahead and\nput in my picture.\n\n485\n00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.320\nClicking my cursor off to\nthe right of it I'm gonna hit\n\n486\n00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.840\nEnter just to make another paragraph.\n\n487\n00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.810\nAnother way I could insert\npicture would be online images.\n\n488\n00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:53.480\nWhat am I gonna search for?\n\n489\n00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.150\nGuess what, Ronnie?\n\n490\n00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:55.680\n&gt;&gt; Bunnies.\n\n491\n00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.816\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna search for a bunny.\n\n492\n00:25:56.816 --> 00:26:00.810\n[LAUGH] And then I have all sorts\nof adorable little bunnies.\n\n493\n00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:04.149\nAnd we can see I have our Creative Commons\nlicense that is showing only, and\n\n494\n00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:05.590\nthat's a nice thing to do.\n\n495\n00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:07.765\nI will click the picture that I want.\n\n496\n00:26:07.765 --> 00:26:09.430\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I insert it.\n\n497\n00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:13.315\nCuz, I mean, how can you,\nthat's adorable, right?\n\n498\n00:26:13.315 --> 00:26:15.120\n[LAUGH] Look, I'm just too tired.\n\n499\n00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.890\nOkay, so there's our bunny.\n\n500\n00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:19.240\nAnd, I'm already starting to\ndo things like resize it.\n\n501\n00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.020\nI went to the corner and resized it.\n\n502\n00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:21.560\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n503\n00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.540\nSorry, I'm jumping ahead.\n\n504\n00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:27.750\nSo the other way that I can get\nmy image in there screenshots.\n\n505\n00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:32.210\nNow I can do a screenshot if I drop\nthis down actually if I hover over it.\n\n506\n00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:34.303\nIt should,\nI thought it would actually give me\n\n507\n00:26:34.303 --> 00:26:36.410\ndifferent,\n&gt;&gt; Options.\n\n508\n00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:39.360\n&gt;&gt; Options and it usually shows you\nthe open Windows that you have like\n\n509\n00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.350\na different application and\nI have PowerPoint.\n\n510\n00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:47.595\nLets go ahead and like throw,\nwhat is this, Inter X World?\n\n511\n00:26:47.595 --> 00:26:48.560\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Explorer Edge.\n\n512\n00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.700\n&gt;&gt; Yes, that's what it is.\n\n513\n00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:54.290\nAll right, I'm just going to type in\nbird for it to bring something up here.\n\n514\n00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:59.410\nSo I should be able to come back to\nWord and, wait, do I just need to hover?\n\n515\n00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:01.960\nHm, all right.\n\n516\n00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.800\nWell, normally I will say and\nmaybe I'm having a little bit of issues.\n\n517\n00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.850\nMaybe it's the virtual machine.\n\n518\n00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:10.740\nNormally, it will actually show you\nthe different windows that you have opened\n\n519\n00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:11.610\non your computer.\n\n520\n00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.200\nThat's okay.\n\n521\n00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.670\nFor now,\nwe're gonna go with Screen Clipping.\n\n522\n00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:20.968\nBecause that way you can say, I wanna get\nthis particular part of the document or\n\n523\n00:27:20.968 --> 00:27:24.190\nwhat's up on your screen and added in.\n\n524\n00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:25.540\nLet's just go ahead and\ndo it and I'll show you.\n\n525\n00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.840\nNotice what was the last thing that I did?\n\n526\n00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:34.310\nI went to the, wow,\nwhy am I having such a problem with edge?\n\n527\n00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:36.930\nMy browser that's what this thing is.\n\n528\n00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:39.290\nThis is a browser I'm\ngoing to the Internet.\n\n529\n00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:43.020\nAnd I had that and that was the last\nthing I had opened or on top\n\n530\n00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:47.570\nif you wanna say as my window, my active\nwindow before I brought Word back up.\n\n531\n00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:51.363\nSo if I was trying to get a screen\nclipping out of PowerPoint click on\n\n532\n00:27:51.363 --> 00:27:54.094\nPowerPoint, get that\nopen then bring up Word.\n\n533\n00:27:54.094 --> 00:27:58.640\nSo that way it's like\nthe next thing behind Word.\n\n534\n00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.770\nSo that is something\nthat you need to know.\n\n535\n00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:02.600\nAnd this is like,\nI don't want this, right?\n\n536\n00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.830\nHit the Escape key.\n\n537\n00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:08.080\nIf you hit the Escape key, then it's not\ngoing to be taking a screen clipping.\n\n538\n00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.200\nI come back into Word,\nand then, there we go.\n\n539\n00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.840\nAnd so nothing has happened right now.\n\n540\n00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.495\nI didn't actually get anything.\n\n541\n00:28:15.495 --> 00:28:21.370\nCould maybe I need a PowerPoint up before\nI wanted to get the screen clipping.\n\n542\n00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:28.330\nLet's go back over to Word, cursor where I\nwanna put the picture, go to Screenshot.\n\n543\n00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:29.660\nSee there it is.\n\n544\n00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.930\nAll right,\nnow that was like I was why is it not,\n\n545\n00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.330\nit's supposed to happen every time.\n\n546\n00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.850\nI think I'm having some display or\nsome graphics\n\n547\n00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:42.000\nissue within the virtual machine\nthat I'm teaching this product from.\n\n548\n00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000\nDon't worry about it, its okay.\n\n549\n00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.510\nI go ahead and click Screen Clipping,\nit dims down the space.\n\n550\n00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:53.282\nAnd now I have a cross here to where I\nam going to say this is the space that I\n\n551\n00:28:53.282 --> 00:28:54.170\nwant to get.\n\n552\n00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:58.400\nBecause maybe I wanted to show somebody\nabout the Quick Access toolbar up here.\n\n553\n00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.290\nAnd then I had a collapse ribbon.\n\n554\n00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:03.690\nIf I click hold and drag, let go.\n\n555\n00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:09.350\nAs soon as I let go, that becomes\nthe screen clipping that I want to access.\n\n556\n00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:10.820\nAnd look at that.\n\n557\n00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.320\nI guess Word has decided like,\n\n558\n00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.950\nnope, you're not supposed\nto be doing this right now.\n\n559\n00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.940\nBut it is nice-\n&gt;&gt; Auto recovered though.\n\n560\n00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.480\n&gt;&gt; Auto recovery is\na beautiful thing [LAUGH].\n\n561\n00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.340\nSo [SOUND] at least we know that\nauto recovery is working smoothly.\n\n562\n00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.330\nAnd then that's where we go.\n\n563\n00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.530\nBut that's how you do screen\nclippings which will be really cool.\n\n564\n00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.620\nI know you're giving me the, hey, we're\ngetting towards the end there Ronnie.\n\n565\n00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:34.580\nBut I have one last thing\nI want to show you.\n\n566\n00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:35.380\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n567\n00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:40.750\n&gt;&gt; It kind of goes along with that screen\nclipping within your Office product.\n\n568\n00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:45.350\nBut it's actually a tool outside,\nit's in Windows.\n\n569\n00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.870\nI love this tool, Ronnie.\n\n570\n00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:47.920\nThe Snipping Tool.\n\n571\n00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:48.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n572\n00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.060\n&gt;&gt; Now, the Snipping Tool is pretty great.\n\n573\n00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.430\nI'm just going into the search and\ntyping in Snipping Tool.\n\n574\n00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:59.410\nIt, well, takes snippings of your\ncomputer [LAUGH] who wherever you want.\n\n575\n00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:04.650\nSo if I was trying to, I'm gonna go ahead\nand minimize Word, minimize PowerPoint.\n\n576\n00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:08.300\nBecause maybe I'd like to\ntake a screenshot here.\n\n577\n00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:13.600\nI can come over to my Snipping Tool, get\nwhat I want on the screen up, ready to go.\n\n578\n00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.970\nAnd then click the New button.\n\n579\n00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:17.840\nI will say there's this delay because\na lot times I'm trying to show drop\n\n580\n00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.270\ndown menus, and\nI have to like really quickly go for it.\n\n581\n00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:24.680\nThis is a newer thing, so if I have it\ndelay like two seconds, I can get to\n\n582\n00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.919\nactivating the drop down to show\nthe option that I want people to click.\n\n583\n00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.020\nIt's really like changed my\nworld [LAUGH] just to know.\n\n584\n00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:35.520\nI was like, my God, that's amazing.\n\n585\n00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:41.070\nLet's go into New,\nit dims down my screen, I get my cursor.\n\n586\n00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:45.652\nI say let's go ahead and\nmake this my snipping, let go,\n\n587\n00:30:45.652 --> 00:30:48.590\nputs it into the snipping program.\n\n588\n00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.390\nThat is like,\nwell that's just really the same thing,\n\n589\n00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:53.810\nas the insert the screen\nclipping that you went into Word.\n\n590\n00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:55.440\nWhy am I making this extra step?\n\n591\n00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.160\nIf I just wanted to go\nright into my document?\n\n592\n00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.570\nThe thing is that in the Snipping Tool,\n\n593\n00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:03.005\nyou have some really simple\nways to mark up an image.\n\n594\n00:31:03.005 --> 00:31:06.525\nSo a lot of times,\nI'm trying to draw attention to,\n\n595\n00:31:06.525 --> 00:31:11.009\nthis is the choice that you want\nto choose, like I wanna circle it.\n\n596\n00:31:11.009 --> 00:31:15.320\nWell if I do it here in the Snipping Tool,\nI can mark it up because I have the pen.\n\n597\n00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:21.680\nAnd I can say like this one right here and\nI can do little arrows.\n\n598\n00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.850\nAnd I can say hi there's a smiley face.\n\n599\n00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.130\nAnd I can change to different colors.\n\n600\n00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:30.570\nI can do the highlighters cuz maybe\nI want to highlight the word bird.\n\n601\n00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.930\nSo I can mark up, very simple\nmarkups within this photograph,\n\n602\n00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.650\nyeah, this photograph.\n\n603\n00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:39.040\nI don't even have to save it on\nmy computer if I don't want to.\n\n604\n00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.330\nNow you could and save it as a file.\n\n605\n00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:48.535\nIf you just copy, edit, copy or Ctrl + C,\ncome over to Word Come back over here.\n\n606\n00:31:48.535 --> 00:31:50.340\nLet's hit Enter,\nI'll just hit Enter twice.\n\n607\n00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:51.410\nAnd then just paste, Ctrl+V.\n\n608\n00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:54.230\nThen you got the picture right in there.\n\n609\n00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:56.760\nSo it's the screen clipping but\n\n610\n00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:01.360\ngoing outside of it instead of\nstaying inside of the Word.\n\n611\n00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:06.850\nYou go and you can do stuff like this and\nthe mark up is part of the picture.\n\n612\n00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:10.370\nI would always go back and\nI'd try to make circles and put it on top,\n\n613\n00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:12.070\ncuz we're gonna add shapes\nto all these documents.\n\n614\n00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.880\nBut then if you move things around,\nthen the shape doesn't stay with it.\n\n615\n00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.220\nI tried grouping, but this is just so\n\n616\n00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.370\nmuch easier if I just wanna\ndo a quick little markup.\n\n617\n00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:21.700\nSo copying and\npasting from your Snipping Tool\n\n618\n00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:26.200\nto bring out part of the different things\non your screen is super, super handy.\n\n619\n00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:31.230\nSo those are the three ways\nthat I can get photographs or\n\n620\n00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:34.620\nimages into my Word document.\n\n621\n00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.060\nSo, that will be the end of this episode.\n\n622\n00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.990\nAnd we'll move on to formatting\nour pictures in the next one,\n\n623\n00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:42.840\nso check that one out.\n\n624\n00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.460\n&gt;&gt; All right Vonne,\nwell that sounds great.\n\n625\n00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.490\nThank you again for\n\n626\n00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:50.480\nat least helping us get the mechanics\ndown of how we can get images into Word.\n\n627\n00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.900\nAlso, we took a brief look at some of\nthe history behind some of the formats\n\n628\n00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:54.840\nas well.\n\n629\n00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.110\nAnd then, of course, we just talked\nabout what was the nature of cats and\n\n630\n00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:00.240\nbunnies here, I mean,\nwho would have known.\n\n631\n00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.480\nBut that is a great place for\nus to go ahead and end this episode then.\n\n632\n00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.650\nFor OfficeProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n633\n00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:07.650\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Vonne Smith.\n\n634\n00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:12.596\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Microsoft

ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.670\nYou're watching the MCSA for\nWindows Server 2012 R2,\n\n7\n00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.100\nspecifically for exam 70-410.\n\n8\n00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.130\nNow, today we're diving into, well,\nconfiguring file and share access, and\n\n9\n00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.240\nhere to help us out, as we continue on\nthrough, is gonna be Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.340\nCherokee, welcome to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.810\n&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me,\nRonnie, back just as promised,\n\n12\n00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.680\nI know we talked about a lot\nof different things so far.\n\n13\n00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.370\nBut we really need to hone in on a couple\nadditional shared configurations here and\n\n14\n00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.120\nsome of the features that\nMicrosoft has given us.\n\n15\n00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.780\nSo the first thing I wanna talk about\nis something called Offline Files.\n\n16\n00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.370\nAnd if we take a look at my screen\nI have a really great drawing here\n\n17\n00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.260\nto demonstrate a generic\nidea of this concept.\n\n18\n00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.465\nSo, on the left hand side,\nwe have a house.\n\n19\n00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:04.050\n[LAUGH] With the man in a house.\n\n20\n00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.140\nSo if you think about working in a\nbusiness environment and then going home,\n\n21\n00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.630\na lot users wanna, a lot of employees may,\nnot necessarily want to but\n\n22\n00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.870\nthey maybe required to complete\ncertain tasks during off hours.\n\n23\n00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.438\nOr perhaps they're traveling, there are a\nlot of different reasons why someone would\n\n24\n00:01:24.438 --> 00:01:30.220\nwanna access information outside\nof that corporate entity.\n\n25\n00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.880\nSo on the right hand side over here,\nwe have our corporation.\n\n26\n00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.614\nNow, Offline Files is a technology\nthat Microsoft came up\n\n27\n00:01:38.614 --> 00:01:41.037\nwith to enable users to do so.\n\n28\n00:01:41.037 --> 00:01:45.781\nSo let's say inside this building\nI have my file server here, and\n\n29\n00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:51.313\nthat's where this user syncs all of his\ninformation up and stores it there.\n\n30\n00:01:51.313 --> 00:01:55.828\nBut when he goes home, maybe there's\nan Excel spreadsheet and a PowerPoint\n\n31\n00:01:55.828 --> 00:02:00.498\npresentation that he wants to work on\nduring the evening, well that's fine.\n\n32\n00:02:00.498 --> 00:02:06.875\nWith offline folders, Offline Files,\nexcuse me, I'm able to select folders and,\n\n33\n00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:10.750\nor files to be able to be\nworked with at a later date.\n\n34\n00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.350\nSo meaning, if I lose\nthe connectivity there, excuse me,\n\n35\n00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.990\nI have to have a VPN or\ndirect connection to sync.\n\n36\n00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.550\nBut I'm still able to access that file,\n\n37\n00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.500\nif I do lose that direct connection or\nVPN connection there.\n\n38\n00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.630\nThat, those two,\n\n39\n00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.091\nyou have to maintain a connection here\nwith Offline Files in order to sync.\n\n40\n00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:39.190\nNow, this concept has been around for\na while.\n\n41\n00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.040\nWe're talking Windows 2000, and\nbecause this is a server and\n\n42\n00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.200\nclient side functionality.\n\n43\n00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.490\nSo that would pair up all the way back\nto XP, Ronnie, so with that being said,\n\n44\n00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.880\nit is listed in the objectives for\nyour 74-10.\n\n45\n00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.276\nIt might not be the number one choice for\norganizations in today's environments.\n\n46\n00:03:02.276 --> 00:03:09.675\nBut you may be faced with a situation\nwhere something more expensive,\n\n47\n00:03:09.675 --> 00:03:16.205\nlike a rich collaboration solution, such\nas SharePoint, is not within your budget.\n\n48\n00:03:16.205 --> 00:03:20.315\nSo, just note that there\nare options like this,\n\n49\n00:03:20.315 --> 00:03:24.580\nOffline Files,\nthat don't require an expensive budget and\n\n50\n00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.468\nit's just piggy backing off of\nthe hardware that you already have.\n\n51\n00:03:28.468 --> 00:03:33.700\nSo, okay, Offline Files,\naka client side caching,\n\n52\n00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.340\nthe reason it's nicknamed that is because,\nthink about it, if we're puling that file\n\n53\n00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.590\ndown onto our client system it's being\ncached there until it can sync back up.\n\n54\n00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.143\nSo let's take a look at the different\nshares that we've created in\n\n55\n00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:48.617\nprevious episodes.\n\n56\n00:03:48.617 --> 00:03:52.275\nIf you did not have a share\nalready that you wanted to manage,\n\n57\n00:03:52.275 --> 00:03:56.024\nthen you would need to create one\nin order to use this feature.\n\n58\n00:03:56.024 --> 00:04:00.230\nSo I have an abundance here,\nlet's just select one and roll with it.\n\n59\n00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.895\nIf I right click on top of that share and\nselect properties,\n\n60\n00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:06.840\nthis is gonna bring up my properties tab.\n\n61\n00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.450\nBut let me zoom in here and\n\n62\n00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.880\nnote that we need to switch over off\nthe General tab unto the Sharing tab.\n\n63\n00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.745\nFrom here if we select Advanced Sharing,\n\n64\n00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:21.590\nthis'll bring us to where we need to\nbe to, I can zoom out a little bit.\n\n65\n00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.000\nNow we've seen this screen before,\nif we hit Caching now,\n\n66\n00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.521\nthis is actually where\nwe want to enable that.\n\n67\n00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:35.788\nNow, I have a couple options here,\nthe first one is where Only the files and\n\n68\n00:04:35.788 --> 00:04:40.281\nprograms that users specify\nare available offline.\n\n69\n00:04:40.281 --> 00:04:44.061\nFor me, this is my favorite,\nsimply because,\n\n70\n00:04:44.061 --> 00:04:48.321\nthe users,\nthey know what they want to be working on.\n\n71\n00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:53.226\nAnd it's not wasting any kind\nof network bandwidth as well\n\n72\n00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:56.700\nas storage on their local machines.\n\n73\n00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.491\nBeing excessive and pulling things\ndown that we don't really need.\n\n74\n00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:01.452\nSo that's why that's my favorite.\n\n75\n00:05:01.452 --> 00:05:04.631\nIf I can speak, but\nEnabled BranchCache still,\n\n76\n00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:08.583\nthat's grayed out because we do\nnot have our FRSM enabled and\n\n77\n00:05:08.583 --> 00:05:13.020\nthat will be in 70-412 you'll\ntake a look at BranchCaching.\n\n78\n00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.020\nNow, if I wanted to explicitly\nprevent any kind of files from\n\n79\n00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.660\nbeing cached down then this is\nthe option that I would select here.\n\n80\n00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.270\nSo that No files or programs from\nthe shared folder are available offline.\n\n81\n00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:33.200\nSo if I wanted to comply\nwith my security policy,\n\n82\n00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.940\nthen this may be a feature that\nyou'd wanna make sure is enabled.\n\n83\n00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.330\nAnd then lastly, my option here is for\nAll files and programs\n\n84\n00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.870\nthat users open from the shared folder\nare automatically available offline.\n\n85\n00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.730\nYou really need to select this,\nwell, with caution or\n\n86\n00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.880\nyou can live of the edge,\nthat's totally up to you.\n\n87\n00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.620\nI would like to use caution when selecting\nthis option because if there are a lot of\n\n88\n00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.890\nfiles that are dynamically being modified,\nmeaning changes happening quite often.\n\n89\n00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.680\nThere's gonna be a lot\nof syncs occurring and\n\n90\n00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.298\nthat could affect system and\nnetwork performance.\n\n91\n00:06:09.298 --> 00:06:13.340\nSo, that's why this first option is\nmy favor, we'll leave it at that.\n\n92\n00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.460\n&gt;&gt; Now, Cherokee before you click on\nthe OK there, when does that optimize for\n\n93\n00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.520\nperformance actually not get greyed out,\nis it when we just put a check there?\n\n94\n00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n95\n00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.120\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n96\n00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.580\njust want to make sure sometimes you\nactually see like earlier, right, so\n\n97\n00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.340\nthe one that Cherokee chose there\nenabled the branch cache, right.\n\n98\n00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.180\n&gt;&gt; Click and nothing happening.\n\n99\n00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, nothing's happening,\nbut the idea,\n\n100\n00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.210\nthe optimized performance,\nit looks the same.\n\n101\n00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.200\nBut then when she selects that one, that\none also gives her that option to do so.\n\n102\n00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.940\nNow these options are gonna be very\nimportant when you get into the exam.\n\n103\n00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.160\nBecause you do need to be able to pick and\n\n104\n00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.230\nunderstand what is\nthe difference between them.\n\n105\n00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:54.090\nWhether or not that user is just needing\naccess to a few files or does the user\n\n106\n00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.650\njust need access to that complete folder,\nand that is a major difference.\n\n107\n00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.490\nAnd Cherokee gave you some of\nthe parameters behind that.\n\n108\n00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.450\nWhat if the user has a smaller device\n\n109\n00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.740\nthat really doesn't have\nthat much storage space?\n\n110\n00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.720\nWell, that might be the consideration and\n\n111\n00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.620\nthe factor that says, well I need to\nchoose this first one over the other one.\n\n112\n00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.030\nOr what if the user says,\nI don't know which files I'm gonna need.\n\n113\n00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.530\nBut I do know I need\naccess to this folder.\n\n114\n00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.010\nWell, you also have to take\nthat into consideration.\n\n115\n00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.600\nSo don't make this choice lightly and\ndon't breeze over these options lightly.\n\n116\n00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.006\nMake sure you give it the due\nconsideration that it's gonna need cuz\n\n117\n00:07:28.006 --> 00:07:30.529\nyou're likely see this as\na scenario on the exam.\n\n118\n00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:34.125\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and you know what Ronnie,\nyou bring out a good point that really\n\n119\n00:07:34.125 --> 00:07:37.367\nunderstanding these selections\nthat I have available to me.\n\n120\n00:07:37.367 --> 00:07:42.220\nIn the past there were\nadditional selections when\n\n121\n00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.922\nit came to our syncing capabilities.\n\n122\n00:07:45.922 --> 00:07:50.188\nSo with the advent of Server 2012 and\n2012 R2,\n\n123\n00:07:50.188 --> 00:07:54.924\nwe have a Sync Center which\nactually automates this process.\n\n124\n00:07:54.924 --> 00:07:59.529\nIt was kind of a pain previously, I can't\nremember exactly how many options you had.\n\n125\n00:07:59.529 --> 00:08:03.484\nBut they were when a user logs on.\n\n126\n00:08:03.484 --> 00:08:07.930\nWhen the system is locked\nwould initiate that sync.\n\n127\n00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:11.289\nAnd those were the parameters to\ngo ahead and initiate the sync.\n\n128\n00:08:11.289 --> 00:08:13.955\nAnd it was kind of a pain\nbecause if you wanted that,\n\n129\n00:08:13.955 --> 00:08:15.825\nthere was no way to force that sync.\n\n130\n00:08:15.825 --> 00:08:20.683\nOr anything to make sure that your\nwork was on a continual basis being\n\n131\n00:08:20.683 --> 00:08:22.313\nupdated frequently.\n\n132\n00:08:22.313 --> 00:08:25.119\nYou would have to lock your screen and\nthen unlock it or whatever.\n\n133\n00:08:25.119 --> 00:08:29.920\nBut, like I said, this technology\nhas been around for a long time.\n\n134\n00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.770\nOver the years,\n\n135\n00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.480\nMicrosoft has been improving on\nit because people like this idea.\n\n136\n00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.130\nThey like this concept of\nbeing able to work from home.\n\n137\n00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.560\nI mean, employers love it,\nif you think about it.\n\n138\n00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.220\nSo it's not really gonna\nbe going away anytime soon.\n\n139\n00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.740\nAs a matter of fact,\nwe'll also discuss newer,\n\n140\n00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.630\nmore advanced technologies\nto really replace this.\n\n141\n00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:55.170\nI'll talk about some of the issues that\nwe may have in a few moments here.\n\n142\n00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.410\nBut for now, I'm just gonna hit OK\nto complete, and it's really simple.\n\n143\n00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:04.440\nSo this is all I need to do\nto set this particular share.\n\n144\n00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.900\nSo this is my server side configuration.\n\n145\n00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.584\nI'll just hit Close here.\n\n146\n00:09:09.584 --> 00:09:13.139\nThere's a little bit of manual\nconfiguration that we need to set up on\n\n147\n00:09:13.139 --> 00:09:14.073\nthe client side.\n\n148\n00:09:14.073 --> 00:09:17.240\nSo just give me a second and\npull that machine up.\n\n149\n00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:22.510\nI think I have a Windows 7 client\nthat we can configure here.\n\n150\n00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.630\nAnd it's not powered on.\n\n151\n00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:31.547\nSo this may just take one second here to\ngo ahead and power our Windows 7 client.\n\n152\n00:09:31.547 --> 00:09:35.567\nThat'll give me time to discuss\na few things as to why it's\n\n153\n00:09:35.567 --> 00:09:37.380\nnot as popular nowadays.\n\n154\n00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:42.337\nSo number one, the pro would be, like I\nexplained to you, it's cost effective.\n\n155\n00:09:42.337 --> 00:09:45.730\nMeaning I don't have to purchase\nanything additional to implement this.\n\n156\n00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:52.497\nBut due to the nature, so we have\nbidirectional syncing happening here.\n\n157\n00:09:52.497 --> 00:09:59.274\nSo sometimes there may be\nconflicts with the actual files.\n\n158\n00:09:59.274 --> 00:10:01.946\nAnd the users will have to determine,\n\n159\n00:10:01.946 --> 00:10:07.580\nsync center would prompt them which\nversion is going to be correct for you.\n\n160\n00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.936\nNow here's a thing, that would just\ncreate some anxiety from the end users.\n\n161\n00:10:11.936 --> 00:10:15.772\nBecause, let's face it, if you think\nyou've been working on this project for\n\n162\n00:10:15.772 --> 00:10:16.414\na few hours.\n\n163\n00:10:16.414 --> 00:10:19.094\nAnd then you try to open it and\nthen you get all these errors,\n\n164\n00:10:19.094 --> 00:10:20.979\nit could cause some anxiety in a network.\n\n165\n00:10:20.979 --> 00:10:25.132\nSo a lot of trouble tickets and\nadmins just didn't like dealing with.\n\n166\n00:10:25.132 --> 00:10:30.045\nSo that's one of the main reasons in\nthe way that that cache was stored wasn't\n\n167\n00:10:30.045 --> 00:10:31.416\neasily accessible.\n\n168\n00:10:31.416 --> 00:10:35.281\nYou couldn't modify it or access it\nto see what version had been there.\n\n169\n00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:39.117\nSo work folders, and we'll be\ntalking about work folders as well.\n\n170\n00:10:39.117 --> 00:10:44.090\nBut work folders was a newer option\nthat Microsoft developed to really\n\n171\n00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.780\nkind of phase this out.\n\n172\n00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:50.790\nBut I think my machine is up here,\nlet's test it out.\n\n173\n00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.250\nYeah, we're good to go here, so\n\n174\n00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.659\nlet's go ahead and\nconfigure that on the client side.\n\n175\n00:10:54.659 --> 00:10:57.044\nOkay great, so my Windows 7 machine is up.\n\n176\n00:10:57.044 --> 00:11:01.773\nSo what I need to do is create a map\nto drive to one of those previous,\n\n177\n00:11:01.773 --> 00:11:03.980\nwell really any kind of share.\n\n178\n00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.420\nSo I already had some listed there, we\nhad some listed that we'd created before.\n\n179\n00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:12.700\nThis is the machine that I wanna\nconnect to, it's PLABDMO1.\n\n180\n00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.960\nAnd the syntax there,\nyou would just do the \\\\ and\n\n181\n00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.220\ntype that UNC path for\nwherever that share was located.\n\n182\n00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.670\nSo again, Network Discovery\nwould need to be enabled for\n\n183\n00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.150\nthat communication to transpire\nto be able to get this access.\n\n184\n00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.290\nOnce this window is displayed,\n\n185\n00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.620\nI can see all those shares\nthat we've created before.\n\n186\n00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.147\nNow if I right-click on share 5,\nbecause that's the folder or\n\n187\n00:11:37.147 --> 00:11:40.400\nthe share that we've\njust enabling caching on.\n\n188\n00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.320\nI can right-click and then just map\na network drive to this location.\n\n189\n00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.832\nYou can use a different\nletter here if you want to.\n\n190\n00:11:48.832 --> 00:11:56.294\nMaybe we'll select, let's see,\nF for 5 because we're super fancy.\n\n191\n00:11:56.294 --> 00:11:59.372\nDifferent options to reconnect at log in,\njust basic Map network drive.\n\n192\n00:11:59.372 --> 00:12:02.929\nThat's all you need here to set this up,\nand we'll hit Finish.\n\n193\n00:12:02.929 --> 00:12:06.208\nNow, there's not anything\nin this folder currently.\n\n194\n00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:08.473\nLet's add a couple of things so\n\n195\n00:12:08.473 --> 00:12:12.580\nthat I can just show you how\ngranular it really could be.\n\n196\n00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:19.830\nSo let's say this is Document1 and let's\ncreate a new document here, Document2.\n\n197\n00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:25.411\nBecause I have the ability to not only\nshare the entire or to cache the entire\n\n198\n00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:30.473\nshare, but I can select different\nfiles if that's all I wanted to.\n\n199\n00:12:30.473 --> 00:12:34.612\nJust to, like we had talked about before,\nto save on bandwidth and so forth.\n\n200\n00:12:34.612 --> 00:12:40.975\nAll right, all I need to do at\nthis point is right-click and\n\n201\n00:12:40.975 --> 00:12:45.314\nthen select Always available offline.\n\n202\n00:12:45.314 --> 00:12:46.968\nLet me zoom in so\nyou guys can really see this.\n\n203\n00:12:46.968 --> 00:12:52.028\nBecause this is one of those important\nthings that came with Server 2012 and\n\n204\n00:12:52.028 --> 00:12:54.155\nit is available in 2012 R2.\n\n205\n00:12:54.155 --> 00:12:56.715\nIt came with Server 2012, but\n\n206\n00:12:56.715 --> 00:13:02.203\nthis is the more simplified way of\nmanaging, so you can just select this.\n\n207\n00:13:02.203 --> 00:13:07.101\nAnd what's happening now is a sync,\nall right, so we have our initial sync.\n\n208\n00:13:07.101 --> 00:13:11.973\nAnd let me see if I can pull that\nup fast enough, which down here in\n\n209\n00:13:11.973 --> 00:13:17.310\nthe bottom right-hand corner,\nif we can do full screen for a second.\n\n210\n00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.070\nYou can see that there's a little,\nlet me zoom in.\n\n211\n00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.454\nThere's that little icon happening.\n\n212\n00:13:21.454 --> 00:13:27.215\nThis is our synchronization and that's a\nshortcut to bring up our Sync Center here.\n\n213\n00:13:27.215 --> 00:13:32.090\nSo if I go ahead and click on that and\nzoom out, you can see the progress, right.\n\n214\n00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:36.292\nSo this just notes that our\nprogress has been completed.\n\n215\n00:13:36.292 --> 00:13:40.852\nNow, we had just kinda touched\non the fact that sometimes\n\n216\n00:13:40.852 --> 00:13:44.565\nconflicts do occur with\nthis configuration.\n\n217\n00:13:44.565 --> 00:13:49.450\nSo this would also be the location in your\nSync Center to verify to make sure that\n\n218\n00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:52.220\nany conflicts hadn't occurred.\n\n219\n00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:58.510\nAnd you can view that right over here on\nthe left-hand side, View sync conflicts.\n\n220\n00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:01.950\nCurrently there are no conflicts,\nthat's a plus.\n\n221\n00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.970\nBut there are also other\n\n222\n00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.510\ntypes of information associated with\nyour syncs that you may wanna check out.\n\n223\n00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:12.080\nSo this is just going to list\na history of the sync results,\n\n224\n00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.430\nif there was an unsuccessful sync.\n\n225\n00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.191\nAnd if we'll look at this,\n\n226\n00:14:16.191 --> 00:14:21.255\nit looks like our sync was completed just\na few moments ago and it was good to go.\n\n227\n00:14:24.782 --> 00:14:30.190\nNow, this one's kind of interesting,\nit's setting up new sync partnerships.\n\n228\n00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:34.906\nSo Microsoft, being a forward-thinking\ncompany, they said, you know what?\n\n229\n00:14:34.906 --> 00:14:38.892\nPeople are bringing in their devices.\n\n230\n00:14:38.892 --> 00:14:43.860\nWe need some kind of way to\nsupport the consumerization\n\n231\n00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:48.530\nof all these mobile devices\nin our environment.\n\n232\n00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:51.260\nSo setting up a new sync share partnership\n\n233\n00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.430\nwould enable you to\nutilize mobile devices.\n\n234\n00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:59.510\nHowever, like I said, here in 2017, there\n\n235\n00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:06.310\nare more advanced options to really work\nwith mobile devices, such as work folders.\n\n236\n00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:10.040\nAnd then also other collaboration\ntools like OneDrive and\n\n237\n00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.480\nall sorts of really cool things.\n\n238\n00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.860\nSo just know that this is kind\nof like the beginning there.\n\n239\n00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.790\nYou could also manage your\noffline folders here as well.\n\n240\n00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.790\nBut pretty simple to set up from\nthe client side, I mean, and\n\n241\n00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:29.110\nyou're giving them the ability\nto really select what folders.\n\n242\n00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:32.500\nLet me just back out of here and\nthen open this back up.\n\n243\n00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.690\nI wanna see something, okay,\nthat's what I wanted to show you.\n\n244\n00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.964\nYou can see that this little symbol here,\nthat sync symbol,\n\n245\n00:15:39.964 --> 00:15:44.416\nis referencing that this document is\nthe document that's being synched.\n\n246\n00:15:44.416 --> 00:15:50.638\nHowever, Document 2 is not, so that's\njust something to be aware of there.\n\n247\n00:15:50.638 --> 00:15:57.350\nNow Working with offline files.\n\n248\n00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:01.610\nYou have the ability to really\nmanage them through group policies.\n\n249\n00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.550\nSo I'd just wanna show\nyou a couple of things\n\n250\n00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.880\nthat you could do to work with\ngroup policy with offline force.\n\n251\n00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:13.662\nSo what I'm gonna do is just go ahead and\ntype in gpedit, and\n\n252\n00:16:13.662 --> 00:16:16.626\nshow you a couple of those .msc, and\n\n253\n00:16:16.626 --> 00:16:20.754\npull up our\nGroup Policy Management Console here.\n\n254\n00:16:23.084 --> 00:16:25.838\nOkay, so\nI have to drill down a little bit.\n\n255\n00:16:25.838 --> 00:16:30.710\nThis is gonna be underneath computer\nconfiguration over on my left hand side\n\n256\n00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:32.640\nand it's already expanded out.\n\n257\n00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.620\nUnderneath computer configuration, you'll\nneed to drill down to administrative\n\n258\n00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.300\ntemplates and we'll just expand that out.\n\n259\n00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.590\nI don't know if you can see that, but I'll\ngive you the path as well in the notes.\n\n260\n00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.470\nAnd then we have Network.\n\n261\n00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.500\nExpand out Network, and\n\n262\n00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.200\nunderneath Network,\nyou'll find the folder Offline files.\n\n263\n00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.690\nThis is where there are plenty\nof different policies that\n\n264\n00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.050\nyou can configure here.\n\n265\n00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:04.150\nSo a couple that I wanted to show you\nhere, exclude files from being cached.\n\n266\n00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:08.490\nSo let's take a look at that and\nlet's zoom in a little bit.\n\n267\n00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:15.420\nJust playing around, sorry I'm trying to\nfind a good spot for us to look at this.\n\n268\n00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.170\nCurrently we can see that\nthis is not configured.\n\n269\n00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:20.730\nNow I'm not saying you have\nto configure all of these.\n\n270\n00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.670\nBut it would just be nice for\n\n271\n00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:27.570\nyou to know that the options do exist here\nwithin group policy, with our editor.\n\n272\n00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:34.420\nSo the idea behind excluding\nfiles from being cached\n\n273\n00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:39.110\nwould be certain types of files, like\nour If you think about file extensions.\n\n274\n00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.540\nAnd if you think about databases,\nand the way databases work,\n\n275\n00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:47.110\nthey are really designed\nto work as a unit, a whole.\n\n276\n00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:53.020\nSo these individual .mdb file\nextensions and different\n\n277\n00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:58.170\nkinds of database file extensions, may be\nsomething that you would want to consider.\n\n278\n00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:02.300\nBecause those files really\nwere not designed to be worked\n\n279\n00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:06.140\noutside of that database environment and\nbrought down to that local machine and\n\n280\n00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.610\nthen being cache and synced back up.\n\n281\n00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:12.040\nSo just kinda calling those out there.\n\n282\n00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:15.240\nJust playing around in here and\n\n283\n00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.020\nlooking at the different types\nof settings that we have.\n\n284\n00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:22.610\nBut a couple of others let's see.\n\n285\n00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.210\nConfigure slow link mode.\n\n286\n00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.770\nThat's another thing that I\nwanted to mention as well.\n\n287\n00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.620\nSo let's find that, if I can see here.\n\n288\n00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:33.100\nConfigure slow link mode.\n\n289\n00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.200\nAnd of course, there it is.\n\n290\n00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.770\nNot in alphabetical order.\n\n291\n00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.420\nSlow link mode is the option\n\n292\n00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:47.360\nto have the system be able to detect,\nand I cannot remember the default.\n\n293\n00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:52.150\nLet's see if we can find that in here,\nNext Setting.\n\n294\n00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.680\nOkay, actually there's zero in here for\nthat default.\n\n295\n00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.230\nYou can specify your bits per second for\n\n296\n00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:05.240\nthe actual speed to say\nWhat do you feel is slow?\n\n297\n00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:09.040\nAnd then the operating system, let me zoom\nin so you guys can see that right here for\n\n298\n00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.120\nyour options.\n\n299\n00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:16.820\nSo once the connection drops beneath this\nthreshold that you're studying here,\n\n300\n00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:22.060\nit will go ahead and\nenable this feature or disable it so\n\n301\n00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:26.470\nyou're not trying to transmit\nduring a slow link moment in time.\n\n302\n00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:32.029\nThere are a lot of different ways\nyou can configure this, but I think\n\n303\n00:19:32.029 --> 00:19:38.860\nit's more important to spend a majority\nof time really configuring work folders.\n\n304\n00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.410\nBecause like I said,\nit's important to understand and\n\n305\n00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:44.180\nknow how offline files will work.\n\n306\n00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.880\nBecause you may enter\na solution where offline files\n\n307\n00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.400\nis the viable solution for you.\n\n308\n00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.280\nBut work folders is probably\ngonna be more common.\n\n309\n00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.360\nSomething that you may entire so I just\nkinda wanted to throw that out there.\n\n310\n00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.140\nAnd if we're looking at the pros and\n\n311\n00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.600\ncons like why one or\nthe other I've also included the link for\n\n312\n00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.590\nyou so maybe if you just wanted to peruse\nthat and do a little more reading on,\n\n313\n00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:12.790\nwhy would I want to use offline\nfiles versus work folders?\n\n314\n00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:15.410\nWork folders, yeah,\nit's a little more involved.\n\n315\n00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:16.950\nWe have to set that up.\n\n316\n00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:18.810\nMaybe this is the option for you.\n\n317\n00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:23.850\nBut I've already noted some of those\nthings, like some of those conflicts.\n\n318\n00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:28.070\nAnd you might have a little bit more\nmanagement as far as troubleshooting,\n\n319\n00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:29.770\ndealing with those end user complaints.\n\n320\n00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.410\nBut it's just completely up to you.\n\n321\n00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:34.450\nAnd how you wanna go ahead and\nset that up.\n\n322\n00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:40.970\nIf you wanna take advantage of more\nadvanced security features and integrate\n\n323\n00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:45.730\nwith Active Directory federated services,\nthen work folders is the way to go.\n\n324\n00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:49.760\nBut you do have some limited\noptions here with offline files.\n\n325\n00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.992\nAnd I think that's about it Ronnie.\n\n326\n00:20:50.992 --> 00:20:54.710\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee well, thank\nyou again for helping us out here and\n\n327\n00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:58.700\ntaking a look especially\nthis idea of offline files.\n\n328\n00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.800\nIt is a good utility to think\nabout especially in those areas\n\n329\n00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.540\nwhere you may not be able to remain\nconnected for your VPN connection or\n\n330\n00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.490\nyou have a link which is\nnot gonna be sufficient.\n\n331\n00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:14.170\nEspecially if we have a lot of files\nthat do need synchronization as well.\n\n332\n00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.340\nSo the idea of actually being\nable to configure this,\n\n333\n00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:20.440\nand and getting it setup, and seeing an\nexample of it, is a good thing for us, and\n\n334\n00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.810\nthere's a lot more for\nus to take a look at as well.\n\n335\n00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:26.050\nAll right, Cherokee,\nany last minute words here?\n\n336\n00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:29.520\n&gt;&gt; You know Ronnie, I did have one last\nminute thought here, I always do, right?\n\n337\n00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.150\nThere were a couple other features\nthat Microsoft does allow for,\n\n338\n00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:38.300\nthat to work offline files Supports.\n\n339\n00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.110\nOne is going to be transparent caching and\n\n340\n00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:46.200\nthen the other is going to be branch\ncache, which those are more advanced.\n\n341\n00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.490\nBut I just want you to know\nlike with transparent cache,\n\n342\n00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:52.980\nlike you had just mentioned\nhaving that VPN or\n\n343\n00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:57.253\ndirect connection to perform\nthat sync is required for\n\n344\n00:21:57.253 --> 00:22:01.840\nour offline files.\n\n345\n00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.460\nThat type of connection\nis not required for\n\n346\n00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:09.300\nwork folders and\nas long as that server is up and\n\n347\n00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.520\nI'm able to communicate then that's\na good to go with offline files.\n\n348\n00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.050\nI just wanted to mention those two\nothers because sometimes you'll\n\n349\n00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:18.180\nhear the term on transparent caching.\n\n350\n00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:23.240\nJust know transparent caching\nworks with the offline files to\n\n351\n00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:28.310\nbring a copy there locally for a period\nof time, but it is not 100% reliable.\n\n352\n00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.520\nIt's not a replacement file for\n\n353\n00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.170\noffline files, because if that server,\nif they do lose connectivity,\n\n354\n00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:37.338\nthen transparent caching is not\ngoing to continue to function.\n\n355\n00:22:37.338 --> 00:22:44.570\nSo offline files is a solution for that\noffline work, just like the name implies.\n\n356\n00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:47.602\nOkay, no more, I promise.\n\n357\n00:22:47.602 --> 00:22:50.050\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee well, that's\na great place for us to end this up,\n\n358\n00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:51.070\nso then.\n\n359\n00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.670\nSigning off for\nITProTV I'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n360\n00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:55.623\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n361\n00:22:55.623 --> 00:23:00.935\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned

00:00:11.869\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:13.783\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.783 --> 00:00:16.662\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.662 --> 00:00:18.207\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\n\n7\n00:00:18.207 --> 00:00:21.096\nin today's episode we are moving\non with more in our A+ series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.096 --> 00:00:24.592\nHaving a good time doing that and\njoining us back in the studio yet\n\n9\n00:00:24.592 --> 00:00:27.853\nagain lending his self to us so\nthat we might learn from him.\n\n10\n00:00:27.853 --> 00:00:29.360\nOur good friend Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n11\n00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.690\nWes, glad to have you again man.\n\n12\n00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.270\nHow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; Man it's going great.\n\n13\n00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.060\nGonna be continuing on in\nControl Panel utilities.\n\n14\n00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.779\nI gotta say that right because we've\nbeen joking around off camera.\n\n15\n00:00:37.779 --> 00:00:39.208\nI've been saying utilitities,\n\n16\n00:00:39.208 --> 00:00:41.923\nyou watch I'm gonna end up throwing\nthat here in this episode.\n\n17\n00:00:41.923 --> 00:00:43.251\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I trust you will.\n\n18\n00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:43.803\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n19\n00:00:43.803 --> 00:00:46.235\nWe'll make our own contributions\nto the English language.\n\n20\n00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:47.218\nMerriam-Webster eat your heart out.\n\n21\n00:00:47.218 --> 00:00:48.350\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n22\n00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.629\nSo speaking of utilities,\nlet's go ahead and let's continue on.\n\n23\n00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.432\nIn the first part, well, we really only\ntalked about [LAUGH] one utility, and\n\n24\n00:00:55.432 --> 00:00:58.960\nit's kind of important because it\ncomes down to web browsing, right?\n\n25\n00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.190\nWe talked about the Internet Explorer\noptions, Internet options as they\n\n26\n00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.800\ncall them, but they're directly\nrelated to Internet Explorer.\n\n27\n00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.220\nNow we're gonna move on and some of the\nnext things that we're gonna talk about is\n\n28\n00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.680\nwell some of the display settings.\n\n29\n00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.482\nAnd for the most part these\nreally haven't changed.\n\n30\n00:01:12.482 --> 00:01:15.879\nWe're gonna kinda walk you through\nthe different operating systems, just so\n\n31\n00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:17.071\nyou can see the interface.\n\n32\n00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:21.372\nAgain the interface is important cuz\nkeep in mind In some of the questions,\n\n33\n00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:24.991\nthey might have an exhibit that\nlet's you look at something and\n\n34\n00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:27.660\nmaybe a portion of it might be clickable.\n\n35\n00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.680\nBut you might not get that benefit, right.\n\n36\n00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.690\nBecause if I can see an exhibit right,\nI can kinda deduce what's going on here.\n\n37\n00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.600\nBut if I only have a text based answer,\nyou better just deuce that you know\n\n38\n00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.310\nexactly how to get there before you\never get into the exam booth and\n\n39\n00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.080\nthat is important.\n\n40\n00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.503\n&gt;&gt; And you know what you might\nthink that that's crazy, right?\n\n41\n00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:46.435\nWhy would they do that, they're just\ntrying to make things difficult and\n\n42\n00:01:46.435 --> 00:01:49.462\nI would have probably been in that exact\nsame camp up until I actually started\n\n43\n00:01:49.462 --> 00:01:50.870\nworking in the field.\n\n44\n00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.840\nAnd sometimes like,\n\n45\n00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.290\nwell a lot of times we have remote\ndesktop type of software, right?\n\n46\n00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.140\nVNC, things of that nature.\n\n47\n00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.340\nYou log in, you do the thing and\nyou're done.\n\n48\n00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.120\nBut sometimes that doesn't work and\nyou have to walk them through it step and\n\n49\n00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.830\nyou have to go okay in the top right hand\ncorner there should be a button that says\n\n50\n00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.050\ncategories or classic view category view,\nclassic view click that where's that?\n\n51\n00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.120\nOkay it's gonna be underneath the red X.\n\n52\n00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.360\nYou're gonna have to really be able to\npaint them a picture and walk them through\n\n53\n00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.320\nit if you can't actually log in or be\nthere physically to do the work your self.\n\n54\n00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.860\nSo don't think that this is outside of the\nscope of something that you would do as\n\n55\n00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.070\nan A+ technician.\n\n56\n00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.590\nYou're almost guaranteed to\nactually have to do this.\n\n57\n00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.974\n&gt;&gt; Flying like Stevie Wonder\nwith a drivers license, right?\n\n58\n00:02:32.974 --> 00:02:33.685\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n59\n00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:34.614\nIt's frustrating, and it's hard.\n\n60\n00:02:34.614 --> 00:02:35.310\n&gt;&gt; You have to know.\n\n61\n00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.942\nExactly.\n\n62\n00:02:35.942 --> 00:02:36.646\n&gt;&gt; But you have to do it.\n\n63\n00:02:36.646 --> 00:02:39.455\n&gt;&gt; And if you think about it,\nyeah, it's frustrating on you but\n\n64\n00:02:39.455 --> 00:02:41.298\nit's also frustrating on the end user.\n\n65\n00:02:41.298 --> 00:02:43.088\nBecause the end user wants to help and\n\n66\n00:02:43.088 --> 00:02:46.168\nif they feel helpless then it\njust elevates the whole problem.\n\n67\n00:02:46.168 --> 00:02:46.695\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n68\n00:02:46.695 --> 00:02:47.504\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n69\n00:02:47.504 --> 00:02:48.004\n&gt;&gt; A lot.\n\n70\n00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:48.588\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't help that's for sure.\n\n71\n00:02:48.588 --> 00:02:49.088\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n72\n00:02:49.088 --> 00:02:49.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n73\n00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.751\n&gt;&gt; I know again that's one of the good\n\n74\n00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:52.538\nthings about having you here on this one.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n75\n00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:55.086\n&gt;&gt; Cuz Dan's worked in help desk for\n\n76\n00:02:55.086 --> 00:02:56.761\nmany years now.\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n77\n00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:58.540\n&gt;&gt; So keep in mind that we're gonna show\n\n78\n00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.560\nyou the different interfaces.\n\n79\n00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.850\nLet's go ahead and I'll tell you\nwhat we'll dive right in here, and\n\n80\n00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.350\nwe're gonna dive into Windows Vista first,\nright.\n\n81\n00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.210\nAnd we're gonna go to appearance and\npersonalization.\n\n82\n00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.740\nWe're already in,\nif you will, the Start menu.\n\n83\n00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.010\nWe've gone, or excuse me, we've gone to\nStart, we've gone to Control Panel and\n\n84\n00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.860\nin our personalization, you see that\nwe do get some of the options here.\n\n85\n00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.750\nNow, I want you to see that,\nhonestly, when we look here,\n\n86\n00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.220\nI don't see a lot of the things that\nI'm supposed to be seeing, right?\n\n87\n00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.380\nIt's a little bit different,\n\n88\n00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.390\nbecause if you go to Control Panel in\nWindows 7 and you go to Appearance and\n\n89\n00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.130\nPersonalization, notice that I\nget this display option, right?\n\n90\n00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.360\nWell, that's kinda interesting, because\nwell I don't see it from appearance and\n\n91\n00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.260\npersonalization right here.\n\n92\n00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.420\nSo that is one of the things,\n\n93\n00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.670\none of the reasons we want you to be\naware of display settings, right?\n\n94\n00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.090\nNotice that it isn't here.\n\n95\n00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.380\nIt is a little bit different.\n\n96\n00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.310\nYou're gonna look at personalization and\n\n97\n00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.510\nyou're gonna get these\ndisplay settings down here.\n\n98\n00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.881\nNotice it is different, right?\n\n99\n00:03:56.881 --> 00:04:00.200\nSo, that again, is one of the things\nthat you do have to keep in mind.\n\n100\n00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.040\nAnd let me go ahead and\njust kind of recap that.\n\n101\n00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.220\nIf we back out to Appearance and\nPersonalization and\n\n102\n00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.740\nwe go back to Control Panel Home,\njust keep in mind.\n\n103\n00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.780\nStill the same location as far as\nAppearance and Personalization, but\n\n104\n00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.640\nagain, notice that we don't\nget that display option.\n\n105\n00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.280\nAnd we have to go to Personalization, and\n\n106\n00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.700\nthen your display settings\nare down here at the bottom.\n\n107\n00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.540\nAnd this is the display settings\ninside of Vista, right?\n\n108\n00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.194\nSo It is a little bit different where in\nWindows 7, if we go to Control Panel &gt;\n\n109\n00:04:27.194 --> 00:04:31.360\nAppearance and Personalization,\nnotice right there at the top.\n\n110\n00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.580\nWe have display.\n\n111\n00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.340\nAnd the same thing goes with Windows 8 and\n8.1, really.\n\n112\n00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.120\nWe go to Control Panel, we go to\nAppearance and Personalization, and yes,\n\n113\n00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.200\nI know wash, rinse, repeat,\nrepetitive nature here.\n\n114\n00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.020\nBut we also have\nthe Display Settings right here.\n\n115\n00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.410\nNow, what can we do inside\nof the Display Settings?\n\n116\n00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.530\nWell, obviously we can modify aspects and\nproperties of the display.\n\n117\n00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.680\nBut I also want you to know that we\ncan do things like, for instance,\n\n118\n00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.820\nwe can enlarge parts of the screen\nwith what's known as the magnifier.\n\n119\n00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.020\nNow the magnifier tool is also in\nthe Ease of Access Center, but\n\n120\n00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.620\nwe can also change things like\nthe text size and the scaling.\n\n121\n00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.761\nThis is where in fact, I think, Dan, you\nhad mentioned this in an earlier episode,\n\n122\n00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:15.438\nwhere we're talking about\ntroubleshooting in the hardware section.\n\n123\n00:05:15.438 --> 00:05:19.090\nWe talked troubleshooting monitors and\nwhy the resolution might be off.\n\n124\n00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.408\nSome times when you adjust\nthese scaling sizes and\n\n125\n00:05:22.408 --> 00:05:27.010\nthe text sizes applications that\nopen up wont be displayed right.\n\n126\n00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.770\nYou're gonna wonder,\nwhat the heck is going on?\n\n127\n00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.160\nThen you realize that in your zoom\noptions, you aren't zoomed but yet\n\n128\n00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.030\nit's still off center.\n\n129\n00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.850\nSo keep that in mind that\nthat can happen here.\n\n130\n00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.080\nYou can also do things like\nadjusting your resolution.\n\n131\n00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.830\nColor depth, we can change and\ncalibrate our color.\n\n132\n00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.150\nWe can also adjust things like\nthe Clear Type text, all right.\n\n133\n00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.760\nNow you also have the ability if you want,\nyou can for instance,\n\n134\n00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.060\nif you go to Adjust Resolution,\n\n135\n00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.290\nyou also have the advanced settings\nhere that you can control.\n\n136\n00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.930\nAnd advanced settings right, when we get\ninto advance settings, this is where you\n\n137\n00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.693\nsee more of the properties of\nthe monitor itself for instance.\n\n138\n00:06:02.693 --> 00:06:05.700\nYou look at the adapter,\nwe can look at the adapter properties.\n\n139\n00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.780\nSame thing that we could see\ninside of device manager.\n\n140\n00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.680\nBut one of the things I want you to know\nis that even though this really isn't\n\n141\n00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.750\ntoo much for us today, you can also\nmodify, not only things like color depth,\n\n142\n00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.800\nbut you can modify things\nlike your refresh rate.\n\n143\n00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.130\nNow, this used to be a thing you would\nhave to know in the earlier A+ days,\n\n144\n00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.350\nin some of the earlier\nexams that I used to teach,\n\n145\n00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.460\nyou used to have to know a little\nbit more about the refresh rate.\n\n146\n00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.030\nWe already talked about that being\na characteristic of your monitors.\n\n147\n00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:37.110\nRemember, refresh rate Is how\noften the screen repaints itself.\n\n148\n00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.276\nAnd anything lower than 60 hertz,\nwhat ends up happening is your eye,\n\n149\n00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:44.964\nyour optical nerve,\nit senses that it isn't a static picture,\n\n150\n00:06:44.964 --> 00:06:47.240\nthat it's actually being repainted.\n\n151\n00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.050\nAnd it can pick up on that and\nit can really give you headaches.\n\n152\n00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.320\nOne of the great things for today,\nthis was more with your CRT monitors,\n\n153\n00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.710\nI want you ladies and\ngentleman to see something out here.\n\n154\n00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.950\nIt really isn't something that\nyou can change too much, right.\n\n155\n00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.670\nNotice that this says hey what's\nthe native settings for this monitor.\n\n156\n00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.590\nIn this case a laptop that I'm on.\n\n157\n00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.630\nAnd I don't have the ability\nto change anything.\n\n158\n00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.067\nSo that's really going to be more specific\nto the monitor that you're sitting in\n\n159\n00:07:11.067 --> 00:07:15.700\nfront of, but you really don't have any\nreason to change it below 60 Hertz anymore\n\n160\n00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.859\neven though you might be able to set them,\nyou might not.\n\n161\n00:07:18.859 --> 00:07:22.351\nAll right, so that is a little bit about,\nin Control Panel if you will,\n\n162\n00:07:22.351 --> 00:07:25.760\nthat's a little bit about some\nof your display settings.\n\n163\n00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.760\nNow the other thing that we also have the\nability to do is, we have User Accounts,\n\n164\n00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.430\nall right now, this depends on\nwhat Control Panel you're in.\n\n165\n00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.710\nSo for instance, if we're in Windows 7,\nyou'll notice that it says,\n\n166\n00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.520\nUser Accounts and Family Safety,\nthat's important.\n\n167\n00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.380\nAgain, I am picking semantics, because\nagain, they might ask you to troubleshoot\n\n168\n00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.980\na Windows 7 machine, and if they say\non the exam, Start &gt; Control Panel &gt;\n\n169\n00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.340\nUser Accounts, that isn't the right\nanswer for Windows 7, right?\n\n170\n00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.394\nThat's the right answer for Windows 8.1.\n\n171\n00:07:55.394 --> 00:07:58.518\nNow, semantics aside,\nif we get in here in User Accounts,\n\n172\n00:07:58.518 --> 00:08:02.279\nkeep in mind, this is obviously where\nwe can manage our user accounts.\n\n173\n00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:06.439\nNow, we also showed you in a previous\nepisode about computer management and\n\n174\n00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:09.169\nthe fact that inside of\ncomputer management, and\n\n175\n00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:11.710\nI kinda wanna just recall\nthis to the top here.\n\n176\n00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:14.640\nIf I get to computer management because\n\n177\n00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.270\ntwo different locations to\nmanage your user accounts.\n\n178\n00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.000\nAnd one is local users and groups,\nthe other one in here is user accounts.\n\n179\n00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.160\nHowever I do want you to keep in\nmind that with user accounts here,\n\n180\n00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:30.230\nunderstand that the one thing\nyou can't do in user accounts is\n\n181\n00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.420\nmake any modifications,\ncreating or modifying groups.\n\n182\n00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.080\nThat has to be in computer management.\n\n183\n00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.790\nIt could be something that\nyou either get right or\n\n184\n00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:42.090\nget wrong on the exam based on whether\nyou are aware of it, so I would be.\n\n185\n00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.470\nNow, when we get into user accounts\n\n186\n00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:48.580\nwe have the ability to do a couple\nof different things, right?\n\n187\n00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.370\nYou can change your own account.\n\n188\n00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.530\nIf you're managing other accounts you\nhave to be an administrative user.\n\n189\n00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.960\nRemember you're making potential\nchanges to the core functionality of\n\n190\n00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.750\nthe operating system, so this does require\n\n191\n00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:04.290\nyou to be an administrator in order\nto manage these other accounts.\n\n192\n00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:09.090\nNow noticed that I can add accounts here\nright in an earlier episode we created\n\n193\n00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.740\nDan an account here too.\n\n194\n00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.030\nAnd if I wanted to I could see things\nlike the properties of his account and\n\n195\n00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.270\ngroup membership.\n\n196\n00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.840\nNoticed that I told you that you\ncan't really modify groups here\n\n197\n00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.170\none exception to the rule,\nand again big exampler.\n\n198\n00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.190\nI can move him from a standard\nuser to an administrator.\n\n199\n00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.510\nLet's say when I first created this\naccount, I already know Dan knows\n\n200\n00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.160\nthe insides and outs of this computer and\nI know this truthfully, right.\n\n201\n00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.570\nI say, well I made him a standard users,\n\n202\n00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.520\nthat was my fault here,\nI need him to be an administrator.\n\n203\n00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:44.840\nNow I get the ability if I want to\nbasically make him an administrator.\n\n204\n00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.951\nNow he's part of the administrator account\nand you do have the ability to make\n\n205\n00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:55.467\nmodifications here to some of the basic\nusers that you find, in Windows 8.1.\n\n206\n00:09:55.467 --> 00:09:58.850\nNow, moving back over the user accounts\nand family safety in Windows 7.\n\n207\n00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:03.650\nYou 'll see that if we choose, user\naccount as well, we can also manage other\n\n208\n00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:08.380\naccount here too and I could let's say for\ninstance let's create a new user here.\n\n209\n00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:14.170\nAnd all created new started user,\nwhat you call this 202.\n\n210\n00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.170\nWe will create the account and\n\n211\n00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:20.550\nthen maybe I want to do some\nbasic management all right?\n\n212\n00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.470\nNotice that one of the things that I\ncan do is change the account type here.\n\n213\n00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:28.450\nBut there is a big difference\nin Windows 7 all right?\n\n214\n00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:33.480\nWindows 7 I told you does not give\nthe ability to modify the user in groups,\n\n215\n00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.550\nif you will, it's only in Windows\n8.1 that they gave you a way that\n\n216\n00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:43.600\nyou can do this outside of local users and\ngroups so, do keep that in mind.\n\n217\n00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.110\nWindows 8.1, yeah I have the ability,\nI can modify it.\n\n218\n00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:52.100\nUp until Windows 8.1, Windows Vista, and\nWindows 7, it's either a standard user or\n\n219\n00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.700\nit is an administrative user account.\n\n220\n00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.425\nAll right, so that being said,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n221\n00:10:57.425 --> 00:10:59.302\nlet's move on to some of\nthe other things that you can do.\n\n222\n00:10:59.302 --> 00:11:01.983\nNow, there's a couple different\nways that you can do this next\n\n223\n00:11:01.983 --> 00:11:04.050\nfunctionality that we're gonna talk about.\n\n224\n00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.469\nAnd we'll show you a couple\nof the different interfaces.\n\n225\n00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:12.740\nInside of your control panel\nif we go start, control panel.\n\n226\n00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.380\nAnd then we go to where is\nthat going to be located.\n\n227\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.610\nBelieve it is in system and security.\n\n228\n00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.750\nAnd you know what it is not in system and\nsecurity.\n\n229\n00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.390\nWhere did that end up?\n\n230\n00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.100\n&gt;&gt; Appearance and Personalization.\n\n231\n00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n232\n00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:32.530\nAnd there's another example of a classic\nexample of why I usually switch\n\n233\n00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:33.670\nto the non category view.\n\n234\n00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n235\n00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.010\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nwe have Folder Options here and\n\n236\n00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.680\nI'm gonna show you another way that I\nam so used to getting into this that\n\n237\n00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.320\nI don't even bother with the Control Panel\nbut we have to really show [LAUGH]\n\n238\n00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.605\nyou the exam objectives and, well,\nyou can see airball right there on camera.\n\n239\n00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:48.600\n[LAUGH] If i go to folder options right?\n\n240\n00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:53.630\nI get the ability obviously modifies some\nof the ways that windows explorer/file\n\n241\n00:11:53.630 --> 00:12:01.180\nexplorer depending on which operating\nsystem you're in, will be viewed.\n\n242\n00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.350\nNow I also want you to understand that\nthere is couple of different ways\n\n243\n00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.140\nthat you can get to this as well.\n\n244\n00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.800\nIf I open Windows Explorer\nfrom the task bar, all right?\n\n245\n00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:14.870\nAnd then I go up to Organize,\nand I scroll down to Folder and\n\n246\n00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.820\nsearch options, I want you to know that\nit brings up the same exact menu, right?\n\n247\n00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.040\nSo, Folder options again,\nfrom Windows Explorer.\n\n248\n00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.820\nI can get to it, Organize Folder and\n\n249\n00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.760\nsearch options and we'll look at\nthese tabs here coming up here.\n\n250\n00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.370\nJust give me a moment.\n\n251\n00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.720\nIf I do this inside\n\n252\n00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:39.890\nWindows 8 and 8.1, again remember\nit's gonna be File Explorer.\n\n253\n00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:42.560\nIt's the new thing that they call it\n\n254\n00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:47.590\ntoday versus what the called it in\nWindows 7 go ahead and close this down.\n\n255\n00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:50.490\nNow you might see something\nhere that's missing.\n\n256\n00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:54.010\nNotice that I don't have that organize\nbutton here in file explorer?\n\n257\n00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:58.520\nThat's because in file explorer, they\ndecided to go with the ribbon view that is\n\n258\n00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.770\nreally, really close to a lot\nof the other Microsoft products.\n\n259\n00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:07.720\nFor instance your Office Suite,\nnotice that I have the options over here.\n\n260\n00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:14.610\nAnd if I choose options I can choose\nchange folder and search options.\n\n261\n00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:16.220\nNow this is important all right.\n\n262\n00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.630\nSo you can see that.\n\n263\n00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.030\nI can show libraries.\n\n264\n00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.460\nI can turn libraries off.\n\n265\n00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.240\nAgain a single-click to open\ndifferent items and stuff.\n\n266\n00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.320\nThe same thing with double-click.\n\n267\n00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.710\nBut I will tell you that you\nalso have this view tab.\n\n268\n00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.070\nView tab is very important and\n\n269\n00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.890\nhere are some things that I definitely\nwant you to be aware of for the exam.\n\n270\n00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:39.030\nAll right I can modify what you can see,\nand what you can't see,\n\n271\n00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.890\ncertain aspects of Windows explorer and\nfile explorer.\n\n272\n00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:45.730\nNow the great thing is the view tab here\nis pretty much the same across the board\n\n273\n00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.120\nhere so that you're aware of that.\n\n274\n00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.600\nNotice this one right here,\nshow hidden files, folders, and drives.\n\n275\n00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.830\nNow for the average end user you really\ndon't have to do too much to this, and\n\n276\n00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:57.890\na lot of times they don't.\n\n277\n00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:02.330\nBut you as a technician, you might need to\nsee different hidden folders and files.\n\n278\n00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:03.960\nLet me show you what I mean.\n\n279\n00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:07.040\nLet me go ahead and I'm gonna close\nthis down, and what I'm gonna do\n\n280\n00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.580\nis I'll open file explorer one more time,\nand we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\n\n281\n00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.310\ndive down into local disk c and what\nwe're gonna look at is the user profile.\n\n282\n00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:19.450\nAnd I'm gonna go to local users, or\nexcuse me I'm sorry, local disk c, I'm\n\n283\n00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:24.610\ngonna go to users and remember these are\nwhere all your user profiles are stored.\n\n284\n00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.350\nAnd I'm gonna get into, in this case,\n\n285\n00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:30.930\nadmin, which is one of the user\nprofiles on this machine.\n\n286\n00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.940\nNow, notice something, and I want you to\npay attention right here around Contacts.\n\n287\n00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:39.550\nNotice that all of these folders, they're\nvery, very dark, but there is times when\n\n288\n00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.450\nyou wanna clear temp files out and\nyou wanna do it manually yourself.\n\n289\n00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.200\nWell where do you do that?\n\n290\n00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.170\nAccording to the default view,\n\n291\n00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:51.310\nyou can't see this hidden folder\nthat;s here that's called AppData.\n\n292\n00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:55.690\nSo what I would have to do, and\nagain this is specific to Windows 8.1.\n\n293\n00:14:55.690 --> 00:15:02.550\nI go to Folder Options and I could Change\nfolder in Search options on the ribbon.\n\n294\n00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:08.777\nAnd I could choose view, and notice\nthat I choose show hidden folders and\n\n295\n00:15:08.777 --> 00:15:14.812\nfiles right, And I could click this,\nand then apply it or say OK to it.\n\n296\n00:15:14.812 --> 00:15:16.883\nIf you say OK it closes\nthe dialog box down.\n\n297\n00:15:16.883 --> 00:15:19.664\nIf you click apply,\nit still does that same thing but\n\n298\n00:15:19.664 --> 00:15:21.800\nleaves the dialogue box open.\n\n299\n00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.430\nAnd if I go back up here,\nI can see app data right.\n\n300\n00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:28.720\nNow, I can drill down into app data,\nlocal, and then I can see all the various\n\n301\n00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.520\ntemp files here and I can potentially\nclear them out if I want to.\n\n302\n00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:38.310\nAlright, now if, In Windows 7 if we do\nthis it isn't really too much different.\n\n303\n00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.170\nThe only difference is here is,\n\n304\n00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.900\nthat we have the organized button\nover in Windows Explorers.\n\n305\n00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.610\nSame thing with Vista, as well.\n\n306\n00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.610\nI have folder and search options.\n\n307\n00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:49.548\nI have the view tab.\n\n308\n00:15:49.548 --> 00:15:53.860\nNotice by default show hidden files and\nfolders isn't selected,\n\n309\n00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:58.788\nselect the radio button choose apply and\nthen I could do the same thing I could\n\n310\n00:15:58.788 --> 00:16:02.680\ncome in here to computer,\nlocal disk C, users.\n\n311\n00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.237\nAdmin.\n\n312\n00:16:03.237 --> 00:16:07.240\nSure enough, there is that hidden file or\nhidden folder app data.\n\n313\n00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.330\nGo into local and then temp as well.\n\n314\n00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.010\nBut one of the things\nthat the ribbon bar does.\n\n315\n00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:18.320\nIn Windows 8.1, I kinda like is\nthe fact that when you choose view,\n\n316\n00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.650\nI want you to notice something right here.\n\n317\n00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:24.220\nAll right if I choose options,\noops let me get back to view.\n\n318\n00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.393\nI don't need to change the options,\n\n319\n00:16:26.393 --> 00:16:29.486\nnotice hidden items right\nhere right on the ribbon?\n\n320\n00:16:29.486 --> 00:16:33.425\nI can do that right here without\nopening up folder options.\n\n321\n00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:35.950\nAnd that's kinda cool to have that.\n\n322\n00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:42.320\nNow the other one that I also want you\nto know is hiding file extensions.\n\n323\n00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.690\nNotice it says file name and\nextensions right here on the ribbon.\n\n324\n00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.790\nSo I could do this in 8.1\nright from the ribbon.\n\n325\n00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:52.572\nBut I also want you to know as a control\npanel utility that if I choose again our\n\n326\n00:16:52.572 --> 00:16:56.832\nfolder options dialog box that I can\ndo this from that same View tab,\n\n327\n00:16:56.832 --> 00:16:58.138\nI can go to View tab.\n\n328\n00:16:58.138 --> 00:17:00.698\nAnd if I scroll down just a little bit,\n\n329\n00:17:00.698 --> 00:17:05.590\nyou'll see that we have hide\nextensions for known file types, right?\n\n330\n00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:07.050\nAnd I could uncheck this.\n\n331\n00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:09.080\nIt would be the same thing\nin Windows 7 and Vista.\n\n332\n00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.120\nAnd I could choose apply.\n\n333\n00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:16.170\nAnd now when I come back, now I see,\nwhat are the different file extensions?\n\n334\n00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.990\nAnd that might be important for\nyou on the exam.\n\n335\n00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:22.350\nSo that's some of the things\nthat you can do there.\n\n336\n00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:25.290\nYou also have things like your\ngeneral options and here,\n\n337\n00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.500\nI'll switch back to Windows 7 here,\n\n338\n00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:32.810\nkinda all over the place just to show you\nthe different kind of views that you have.\n\n339\n00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.870\nWe got our general options\nwhere you could do again,\n\n340\n00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:36.680\nsingle click versus double click.\n\n341\n00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.510\nAgain, do you wanna see all folders and\nwhat that would\n\n342\n00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:44.130\ndo is that would modify the hierarchical\nview here on the other side.\n\n343\n00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:48.360\nSearch functionality again, how to search\nand different options that you can do.\n\n344\n00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.005\nNon index locations and what to search.\n\n345\n00:17:51.005 --> 00:17:52.920\nSo we can also modify those.\n\n346\n00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.080\nNow, if you have somebody that goes in\nhere and they make all different kinds of\n\n347\n00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:01.080\nclicks and you wanna restore the defaults,\nyou can just click this button right here.\n\n348\n00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.380\nYou can choose, apply.\n\n349\n00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:06.622\nAnd then you'll notice if we go back\nto the View tab, keep in mind that,\n\n350\n00:18:06.622 --> 00:18:12.058\nit'll reset essentially a lot of the\nsettings that could get messed up in here.\n\n351\n00:18:12.058 --> 00:18:14.330\nAll right, so that's a little\nbit about your folder options,\n\n352\n00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:17.660\nwe do have some other things that we\nwanna look at in the control panel.\n\n353\n00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:21.366\nI'm gonna go ahead and switch over here,\nwe're gonna kinda stay in Windows 8.1 for\n\n354\n00:18:21.366 --> 00:18:24.158\na little bit because we've been\ndealing with Window 7 as well and\n\n355\n00:18:24.158 --> 00:18:26.270\nwe want to kind of give\nyou options essentially.\n\n356\n00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.240\nMaybe not folder options.\n\n357\n00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.860\nWe just gave you that but\nadditional options right?\n\n358\n00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.612\nSo I'll go to control panel.\n\n359\n00:18:31.612 --> 00:18:34.753\nNow what we're going to be doing is\nwe're going to be looking at system.\n\n360\n00:18:34.753 --> 00:18:36.610\nNow system is important.\n\n361\n00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:40.190\nWe've kind of looked at it in other\nways where we've right clicked on\n\n362\n00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.030\nthe Windows Charm here.\n\n363\n00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.248\nAnd we've chose system here\nfrom this menu as well.\n\n364\n00:18:45.248 --> 00:18:49.677\nYou could also I guess I will show\nyou Windows 7 cuz you can also get to\n\n365\n00:18:49.677 --> 00:18:51.869\nhere choosing the start button.\n\n366\n00:18:51.869 --> 00:18:56.710\nRight clicking right clicking let's\ntry to right click there Wes.\n\n367\n00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:00.190\nWe can right click and\nwe can also choose properties.\n\n368\n00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:01.760\nAnd it's gonna get us\nto the same location.\n\n369\n00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.530\nNotice it's Control Panel,\nSystem and Security, and System.\n\n370\n00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.800\nSo, I just wanted to show you a few\ndifferent ways that you can get to it.\n\n371\n00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.070\nSo looking at System,\none of the things that I'm really,\n\n372\n00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:16.120\nreally, worried about here on\nthe exam are, Performance Settings\n\n373\n00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.770\nas well as remote settings and\nthen things like system protection.\n\n374\n00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.475\nAnd the great thing is you have these\ndifferent task links that allow you to\n\n375\n00:19:24.475 --> 00:19:25.744\nget to these locations.\n\n376\n00:19:25.744 --> 00:19:28.047\nRight so for instance,\nif I choose remote settings.\n\n377\n00:19:28.047 --> 00:19:30.470\nThis just brings up\nyour system properties.\n\n378\n00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:33.219\nAnd It really just starts you out\non different tabbed locations.\n\n379\n00:19:33.219 --> 00:19:35.470\nNotice this is remote but guess what?\n\n380\n00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.690\nNotice there's system\nprotection right next to it.\n\n381\n00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:40.979\nWell you could probably only imagine where\nthis hyperlink's gonna take you right?\n\n382\n00:19:40.979 --> 00:19:44.096\nSystem protection takes you\nto system protection tab.\n\n383\n00:19:44.096 --> 00:19:48.014\nAll right and then finally\nadvanced system settings right?\n\n384\n00:19:48.014 --> 00:19:50.490\nIt takes you to the advanced option right?\n\n385\n00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:54.675\nSo system protection, this is where we\ncould turn on system protection as well as\n\n386\n00:19:54.675 --> 00:19:58.429\nmanipulate and utilize the system\nrestore functionality that we talked\n\n387\n00:19:58.429 --> 00:20:00.844\nabout pretty extensively\nin other episodes.\n\n388\n00:20:00.844 --> 00:20:02.850\nSo we're not gonna go\ninto it too much here.\n\n389\n00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:06.760\nBasically restoring your configuration of\nyou operating system to an earlier point\n\n390\n00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.240\nin time through something know as\na restore point, remote, right.\n\n391\n00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.480\nThis is where we can\nturn on remote desktop,\n\n392\n00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.720\nunderstand remote desktop allows me\nto connect back this machine and\n\n393\n00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.840\ncontrol the desktop as though I was,\nsitting locally, logged into the machine.\n\n394\n00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.184\nVery good in those situations like Dan\nwas saying, where maybe you do have that\n\n395\n00:20:25.184 --> 00:20:28.032\noption, where you don't have to\nwalk a user through everything.\n\n396\n00:20:28.032 --> 00:20:31.434\nYou can actually connect to their machine,\ntake control over the desktop, and\n\n397\n00:20:31.434 --> 00:20:35.360\nyou can make the modifications and\nthen disconnect, and they can log back in.\n\n398\n00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.540\nHowever, there might be certain scenarios\nwhere you want to actually show them.\n\n399\n00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.900\nMaybe you've tried to go\nthrough the step by steps.\n\n400\n00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.940\nAnd somebody just doesn't really\nknow where to click around.\n\n401\n00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:50.900\nWell Remote Assistance, which is on\nby default unlike Remote Desktop,\n\n402\n00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:56.520\ndisabled by default, zam alert, allows\nsomebody to connect to this machine.\n\n403\n00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.860\nAnd actually view at the same\ntime what's going on.\n\n404\n00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.140\nSo that's important.\n\n405\n00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.170\nWe can share control over the desktop.\n\n406\n00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:08.310\nAnd Dan essentially could if he wanted to,\nhe could see what they're seeing.\n\n407\n00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.960\nThey could see what he's seeing and\n\n408\n00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.755\nessentially they could share the control\nof the desktop in which it would allow Dan\n\n409\n00:21:13.755 --> 00:21:17.960\nto walk through the process of whatever it\nmight be that he needs to fix or myself.\n\n410\n00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.930\nAnd then the end user can also\nsee it as well, all right?\n\n411\n00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:24.930\nOne of the next things I wanna talk about\nis on that advanced tab that we have\n\n412\n00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:25.780\nback here.\n\n413\n00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.080\nNotice there is the performance option.\n\n414\n00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.680\nPerformance option is important\nbecause this is where\n\n415\n00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.960\nyou can set different visual effects,\nif you will.\n\n416\n00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.980\nAgain, keep in mind it depends\non what your CPU utilization is.\n\n417\n00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:41.550\nIf you are adjusting for best performance\nit's gonna strip some of these down and\n\n418\n00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:44.640\ntry to save you processing power.\n\n419\n00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.589\nAdjust for best appearance means that\nyou have the resources within your\n\n420\n00:21:48.589 --> 00:21:52.871\nmachines to give you the best graphical\nuser interface experience possible.\n\n421\n00:21:52.871 --> 00:21:55.916\nAdvanced, this is where you do,\nyou could see processor scheduling.\n\n422\n00:21:55.916 --> 00:21:59.210\nI think, processor scheduling is a little\nbit beyond the scope of this exam but\n\n423\n00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:00.630\npage file, right?\n\n424\n00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:01.880\nWe talk about virtual memory.\n\n425\n00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.254\nKeep in mind that virtual memory,\nessentially,\n\n426\n00:22:04.254 --> 00:22:07.770\nis a way that you have something known\nas a VMM, a Virtual Memory Manager.\n\n427\n00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:11.891\nAnd what the Virtual Memory Manager\ndoes is it allows you to take data\n\n428\n00:22:11.891 --> 00:22:15.363\nthat isn't currently being\nused in your physical RAM and\n\n429\n00:22:15.363 --> 00:22:18.640\nthen basically page it or\nwrite it to the hard drive.\n\n430\n00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.792\nAnd the Virtual Memory Manager\ncould swap information in and\n\n431\n00:22:21.792 --> 00:22:24.569\nout of the hard drive and\nRAM and this is really good for\n\n432\n00:22:24.569 --> 00:22:28.867\nsystems that in the earlier days had\nlimited amounts of physical memory, right?\n\n433\n00:22:28.867 --> 00:22:32.305\nAgain, remember memory,\nit is a temporary workbench.\n\n434\n00:22:32.305 --> 00:22:34.995\nThe more of it I have, the more I\ncan be working with it one time.\n\n435\n00:22:34.995 --> 00:22:37.105\nHowever, as it starts to get full,\n\n436\n00:22:37.105 --> 00:22:40.635\napplications might call on a location\nin memory and don't have it.\n\n437\n00:22:40.635 --> 00:22:44.355\nThe virtual memory manager could then\ntake that information out of RAM\n\n438\n00:22:44.355 --> 00:22:46.760\nthat isn't currently being utilized.\n\n439\n00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:52.360\nAnd page it right to the hard drive and\nthen allow an application to continue\n\n440\n00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:57.220\nto consume memory and be able to work\nrather than the application freezing,\n\n441\n00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.980\nhanging up or\nnot being able to work at all.\n\n442\n00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.580\nAnd it's transparent to the application.\n\n443\n00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.350\nThat's why they call it a page or\na swap file cuz it's swapping data in and\n\n444\n00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:05.280\noff the hard drive.\n\n445\n00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:11.030\nNow Microsoft recommends that whatever\nyour physical RAM is, so let's say 2 gigs,\n\n446\n00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:16.180\nthat your paging file be set to 1.5 times\nwhatever the physical RAM is installed.\n\n447\n00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.975\nSo if you have 2 gigs of RAM,\nwell, guess what?\n\n448\n00:23:18.975 --> 00:23:21.366\n1 times 2, right, is 2.\n\n449\n00:23:21.366 --> 00:23:22.870\nAnd then another 1.5,\n\n450\n00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:26.810\nessentially what you're gonna\nhave is 3 gig, a 3 gig page file.\n\n451\n00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:31.560\nHowever, a lot of times it's better\nto just let Windows Manage this and\n\n452\n00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:32.670\nthis is where we can do that.\n\n453\n00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:35.680\nAutomatically manage the page file for\nall drives.\n\n454\n00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.760\nIf we didn't want to do this,\n\n455\n00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.940\nwe could always do a manual configuration\nhere on each individual drive.\n\n456\n00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.820\nBut we're not gonna do that right now.\n\n457\n00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.280\nBecause the and\n\n458\n00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.650\nI'm not even though it looks like I made\nchanges I didn't make changes to it.\n\n459\n00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.590\nSo keep in mind that if you\ndo make changes to that\n\n460\n00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:53.540\nit requires a restart to\nthe operating system.\n\n461\n00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:57.495\nOne of the things that they do talk about\nis sometimes you can optimize performance\n\n462\n00:23:57.495 --> 00:24:01.009\nbecause remember your hard drive is\nconstantly doing reads and writes.\n\n463\n00:24:01.009 --> 00:24:04.881\nOr your operating system is constantly\ndoing reads and writes with a paging file.\n\n464\n00:24:04.881 --> 00:24:07.622\nWell if you take that paging file and\nyou move it to a separate drive.\n\n465\n00:24:07.622 --> 00:24:10.322\nThen the operating system and\nall the applications that\n\n466\n00:24:10.322 --> 00:24:14.770\nare using the existing hard drive don't\nhave contention with the paging file.\n\n467\n00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:17.240\nSo that's called page file optimization.\n\n468\n00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.630\nAgain with systems today having so\n\n469\n00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:24.220\nmuch memory in them it's not that we\ndon't necessarily use the paging files.\n\n470\n00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.890\nCertain applications are still\ngeared to look for it,\n\n471\n00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:32.360\nhowever it's not really much of an issue\ntoday as it was in earlier days.\n\n472\n00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:37.900\nAll right, a couple of the last things\nI kind of want to round off here,\n\n473\n00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.810\nthey talk about control panel utilities.\n\n474\n00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:44.290\nI do want to mention, just briefly, in\nthe control panel if you go to System and\n\n475\n00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:45.080\nSecurity.\n\n476\n00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.630\nSystem and Maintenance if you're\ninside of Windows Vista, System and\n\n477\n00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:52.220\nSecurity in Windows 7 and\nWindows 8.1 is the Windows firewall.\n\n478\n00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:55.880\nWe've kind of already talked about\nthe Windows firewall in other episodes,\n\n479\n00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.350\nwhere we talked about the features.\n\n480\n00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:00.560\nWe really did talk about this a lot, but\n\n481\n00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.550\nI do wanna mention it as\na control panel utility.\n\n482\n00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:06.920\nKeep in mind,\nthat it is what allows you to, or\n\n483\n00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:12.830\nan application to communicate inbound\nform the network to your system.\n\n484\n00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:14.480\nBy default, as a recap,\n\n485\n00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.825\nremember that the Windows firewall blocks\nall traffic coming into your system.\n\n486\n00:25:18.825 --> 00:25:22.970\nUnless you allow that application to\ncommunicate through the firewall,\n\n487\n00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.330\nit's called creating an exception.\n\n488\n00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:29.320\nBy default,\nall outbound traffic is allowed, and\n\n489\n00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.580\nagain, you can see some of\nthe things that you can do here.\n\n490\n00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:36.620\nChanging the intrusive nature of\nthe notification settings, I don't like\n\n491\n00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.280\nto do this, I like to be aware when\nthings are attacking my computer.\n\n492\n00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.870\nBecause if I turn off the notifications,\n\n493\n00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.110\nI don't really know that\nsomething's happening.\n\n494\n00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:46.530\nAnd then this isn't really recommended,\nbut you could turn off or\n\n495\n00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:50.426\non the firewall, or turn it on or\noff, we'll try better English.\n\n496\n00:25:50.426 --> 00:25:53.108\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If things get hosed up a little\n\n497\n00:25:53.108 --> 00:25:57.350\nbit too much you can always restore\nthem to the original defaults.\n\n498\n00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:01.530\nAnd then if you're a little bit more tech\nsavvy you can always use the Windows\n\n499\n00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:04.050\nfirewall with advanced settings.\n\n500\n00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:08.580\nAll right, last thing on the list that\nwe wanna talk about, just briefly,\n\n501\n00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:13.660\nis what are known as Power Options or\nPower Plans as they're called today.\n\n502\n00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:15.870\nLet's go ahead and\ngo to System and Security, and\n\n503\n00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:18.650\nyou will see Power Options here.\n\n504\n00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.680\nNow, if we get into Power Options,\n\n505\n00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:25.190\nI want you to keep in mind that there\nare a few different plans here.\n\n506\n00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:27.820\nThere are three different plans,\nnow, you might say, well Wes,\n\n507\n00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.530\nI only see two of them on the screen.\n\n508\n00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:33.550\nWell, that's because if I choose\nthis little drop-down arrow,\n\n509\n00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.310\nyou'll see that there is another\none in here, High performance.\n\n510\n00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:39.360\nBut, by default, they kinda hide it,\nespecially if you're on a laptop.\n\n511\n00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.350\nLet's talk about these\ndifferent power plans.\n\n512\n00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:45.080\nIn the earlier days, and\neven in command prompt today,\n\n513\n00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.710\nthey're still called power schemes.\n\n514\n00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:55.060\nIn fact, there is a command prompt command\n\n515\n00:26:55.060 --> 00:27:00.090\nthat I want you to be aware of that's\nassociated with power options.\n\n516\n00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:04.070\nAnd it's called powercfg.exe, and\n\n517\n00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:07.670\nthis allows you the ability to\nmodify this from command prompt.\n\n518\n00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:12.070\nI don't really think they're gonna get\ntoo much in-depth because there is a lot\n\n519\n00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.780\nof stuff that you have to be aware of.\n\n520\n00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.560\nAnd let me see if I can remember\nit real quick, powercfg\n\n521\n00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:24.329\nI think it's list, yeah, and you can see\nthings you have to know GUIDs, right?\n\n522\n00:27:24.329 --> 00:27:26.930\nYou could see the power\nplans inside of here, and\n\n523\n00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:29.560\nI can see with the asterisk symbol, kind\nof like what we talked about with disk\n\n524\n00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.280\nmanagement, that this is the one\nthat's currently selected.\n\n525\n00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.610\nSo I just bring that up there as a little\ntidbit in case they ask you on the exam.\n\n526\n00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:41.940\nNow going back to power plans,\nagain this defines how power is treated or\n\n527\n00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.510\nhow you're operating system\nwill treat the hardware.\n\n528\n00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:51.345\nIf you're on battery power versus if\nyou are plugged into the AC outlets or\n\n529\n00:27:51.345 --> 00:27:53.795\nthe power adapter, if you will.\n\n530\n00:27:53.795 --> 00:27:57.375\nYou can do things like\nrequiring a password on wakeup,\n\n531\n00:27:57.375 --> 00:27:59.905\nyou can choose what the power\nbutton does on the machine,\n\n532\n00:27:59.905 --> 00:28:03.072\nyou can see I can even create\npower plans if I want.\n\n533\n00:28:03.072 --> 00:28:06.802\nWhen it comes to these three different\npower plans, balanced is one that,\n\n534\n00:28:06.802 --> 00:28:09.832\nlike you can see, and you guys can\nprobably pause it and sit there and\n\n535\n00:28:09.832 --> 00:28:11.182\nread or read along with me.\n\n536\n00:28:11.182 --> 00:28:16.032\nNotice it says automatically balances\nperformance with energy consumption\n\n537\n00:28:16.032 --> 00:28:18.032\non capable hardware.\n\n538\n00:28:18.032 --> 00:28:18.867\nWhat the heck does that mean?\n\n539\n00:28:18.867 --> 00:28:24.870\n[LAUGH] All right, what it means is\nthat if you need CPU power, it's\n\n540\n00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:28.650\ngonna ramp up the CPU, it's gonna give\nyou the processing power that you need.\n\n541\n00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:32.570\nWhen you're not using CPU intensive\napplications, it throttles it,\n\n542\n00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:34.040\nit slows it down, all right?\n\n543\n00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.170\nThat's why they call it balanced,\n\n544\n00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.080\nif you need the processing power,\nyou're gonna get it.\n\n545\n00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.780\nIf you're not utilizing hardware and\n\n546\n00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:43.180\nCPU utilization,\nyou're gonna reduce the voltage or\n\n547\n00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:47.650\nit will reduce the voltage to the system\ntrying to prolong the battery life.\n\n548\n00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:49.200\nPower saver, notice it says,\n\n549\n00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.640\nsaves energy by reducing your\ncomputer's performance where possible.\n\n550\n00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.610\nWhat does this mean?\n\n551\n00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:57.470\nWell this means it's gonna throttle\nthe CPU whether you need the power or not.\n\n552\n00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:00.680\nSo be careful on this one, because it does\nreduce your performance just like it says.\n\n553\n00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.860\nIt means that we're gonna throttle the CPU\nand it doesn't matter if you launch\n\n554\n00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.170\nan application that requires\nthat processing power.\n\n555\n00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:12.365\nThat's why they say it could\naffect affect performance, right?\n\n556\n00:29:12.365 --> 00:29:15.265\nHigh performance says we don't\ncare about conserving anything,\n\n557\n00:29:15.265 --> 00:29:18.425\nwe're gonna run it wide open right\nuntil your battery just fails.\n\n558\n00:29:18.425 --> 00:29:24.405\nNot fails, but [LAUGH] runs out of juice,\nso do keep that in mind.\n\n559\n00:29:24.405 --> 00:29:28.305\nLast thing I wanna mention here is\nthat there are a couple different low\n\n560\n00:29:28.305 --> 00:29:30.285\npower modes that you have to be aware of.\n\n561\n00:29:30.285 --> 00:29:33.520\nThere is what is known as sleep or\nsuspend,\n\n562\n00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:36.270\nI've heard it called quite\na few different things, right?\n\n563\n00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:42.270\nSleep, suspend, standby if you will, and\nit's just different classifications and\n\n564\n00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:46.510\nas it's gone through the Windows versions\nit's called something different, right?\n\n565\n00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:50.020\nWe'll call it sleep,\nthe other one is hibernate, okay?\n\n566\n00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.820\nSo what is the difference\nbetween these two?\n\n567\n00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:57.720\nWell, sleep, what it does is it shuts down\nall power, goes into a low powered mode\n\n568\n00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:02.990\nby shutting down all of your devices,\nwith the exception of RAM.\n\n569\n00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:07.290\nIt keeps an electrical current still\nrefreshing the information that's inside\n\n570\n00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:11.550\nof your random access memory,\nmeaning it's retaining your data.\n\n571\n00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:15.030\nHere's the problem, while that's good and\nit does conserve your battery life, it\n\n572\n00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:20.452\nmeans if that battery finally loses power,\nyou lose power to your RAM, guess what?\n\n573\n00:30:20.452 --> 00:30:22.820\nYou can also lose your data, so\nyou've got to be careful, right?\n\n574\n00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.120\nIt does prolong the battery life, but\n\n575\n00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.620\nyou do have a potential\nto lose your information.\n\n576\n00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.480\nHibernate, what's difference between that?\n\n577\n00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.180\nWell hibernate does something\na little bit different,\n\n578\n00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.830\nit powers everything\ndown including your RAM.\n\n579\n00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:39.950\nBut not before it takes\nthe entire contents of RAM and\n\n580\n00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:41.020\nwrites it to the hard drive.\n\n581\n00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.280\nThat's called a hiberfil.sys file,\n\n582\n00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:48.160\nby the way, so\njust in case they ask you on the exam.\n\n583\n00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:54.450\nI remembered it as the hibernation file,\nhiber, H-I-B-E-R-F-I-L.S-Y-S, right?\n\n584\n00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:57.360\nIt's basically all\nthe contents of your RAM, and\n\n585\n00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.330\nwhat's interesting is when your computer\ngoes through a normal boot process.\n\n586\n00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:04.050\nThe Windows boot manager says, before it\neven looks at the kernel file that's on\n\n587\n00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:07.910\nthe hard drive, it says wait,\ndo I find the hyperfill.sys file?\n\n588\n00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:09.140\nOkay, I see there's something there,\n\n589\n00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:11.460\nthat means there's hibernation\nstate data in there.\n\n590\n00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:14.490\nIn fact, I'm not even gonna mess\nwith a normal kernel file and\n\n591\n00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:15.540\ndo a normal bootstrap.\n\n592\n00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:19.830\nI'll just pull that file and dump it back\ninto RAM, and then you resume from there.\n\n593\n00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:23.770\nSo the benefit is you get\nthe power saving that you need\n\n594\n00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:27.610\nto prolong your battery life, but at\nthe same time, you don't lose your data.\n\n595\n00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:30.440\nSo, why would you use one over the other?\n\n596\n00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.480\nWell, it really just comes down to how\nfast do you wanna resume from a low\n\n597\n00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.200\npowered state, all right?\n\n598\n00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:39.980\nYou don't go to the full boot process that\nyou would in a hibernation state, but\n\n599\n00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:43.600\nfastest resume is coming\nback from the sleep mode.\n\n600\n00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:49.210\nNow Windows and most of the operating\nsystems have some kind of hybrid method.\n\n601\n00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:54.890\nThey actually have, what is it, fast\nreboot or fast standby, I believe it is.\n\n602\n00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:59.418\nIt's a hybrid and what this actually\ndoes is it does the same thing with\n\n603\n00:31:59.418 --> 00:32:03.870\na hyberfil.sys file, but\nit also does it in a sleep mode.\n\n604\n00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:07.010\nSo what it does is it goes into sleep and\nit keeps your RAM refreshed,\n\n605\n00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:10.270\nbut right before it did that it\nwrote everything to the hard drive.\n\n606\n00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:13.880\nSo you kind of get the best of both,\nif you lose power,\n\n607\n00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.740\nyou still have the hiberfil file,\nso that's actually kind of cool.\n\n608\n00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:19.640\nI think it's called fast standby\nis what it's called, but\n\n609\n00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.180\nit's not something that's\njust unique to Windows.\n\n610\n00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:23.610\nLinux has been doing this for awhile,\n\n611\n00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:26.570\nI think Windows just\nrecently jumped on board.\n\n612\n00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:29.510\nIt's why we have ultra fast\nreboot times today and\n\n613\n00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:33.930\nit's sometimes coupled with solid state.\n\n614\n00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:40.520\nYour systems basically will reboot or\nresume so fast today.\n\n615\n00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.790\nSo those are a few of the things to\nkeep in mind when it comes to your\n\n616\n00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:44.640\npower options.\n\n617\n00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.930\nBe aware of the different types,\n\n618\n00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:48.200\nalso be aware of some of\nthe files that we've said and\n\n619\n00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.800\nall the different paths when it comes to\ngetting to these control panel utilities.\n\n620\n00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.240\nBecause I can tell you,\nthe one way you like to get to them\n\n621\n00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.680\nprobably won't be the way\nthey ask you on the exam, and\n\n622\n00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:02.550\nit can save you not only a lot of time and\neffort in your help desk experience.\n\n623\n00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:06.250\nBut it also can help you to pass that exam\nby getting some of these easy softball\n\n624\n00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:10.330\npitch questions right just by knowing the\ndifferent paths to get to these utilities.\n\n625\n00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:12.890\n&gt;&gt; All right, Wes, a lot of great\nutilities found inside of the control\n\n626\n00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.790\npanel in a Windows operating system.\n\n627\n00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:18.400\nSo as he's been alluding to get familiar\nwith them, get comfortable with working\n\n628\n00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:22.350\nwith them, and find those multiple\nways in which you can access them.\n\n629\n00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:25.840\nBecause like he said, you never know\nwhich one they're gonna throw at you and\n\n630\n00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.410\nit's usually the one\nthat's you're weakest.\n\n631\n00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:31.350\nI don't know how they know, but they know,\nthey're smart people over at COMPTIA.\n\n632\n00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:33.130\nAll right Wes, thanks for\njoining us today, and\n\n633\n00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:34.660\nwe do thank our audience for watching.\n\n634\n00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.300\nBut, looks like it is that time ladies and\ngents for us to sign off.\n\n635\n00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.900\nFor ITPRO.TV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n636\n00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:41.670\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n637\n00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:43.891\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n638\n00:33:43.891 --> 00:33:49.690\n[MUSIC]\n\n639\n00:33:49.690 -->

00:00:08.426\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.426 --> 00:00:11.506\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:11.506 --> 00:00:13.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone, and\n\n6\n00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.531\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:17.824\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n8\n00:00:17.824 --> 00:00:22.633\nAnd in today's episode we are still\ncontinuing our Kali Linux series it's been\n\n9\n00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:24.160\na lot of fun so far.\n\n10\n00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.631\nAnd joining us back in the studios to\nhave even more fun, our good friend, Mr.\n\n11\n00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:28.327\nMike Rodrick.\n\n12\n00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:30.480\nMike, glad to have you yet again,\nsir, and how's it going today?\n\n13\n00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.073\n&gt;&gt; It's going great,\nDaniel, excited to be here.\n\n14\n00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:33.542\nAnd we are gonna have a little bit of fun.\n\n15\n00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:37.110\nWe're gonna try to take some of\nthe concepts that we learned so far in our\n\n16\n00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.260\npast episodes and put it in use, and\nsee if we can't do some exploits, right?\n\n17\n00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.960\nSound like fun?\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n18\n00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.510\nsounds like a good time in my book.\n\n19\n00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.900\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, where do we start?\n\n20\n00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.550\nSo far again, in our previous episodes,\nwe've played with the few different tools.\n\n21\n00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.543\nWe've looked at like Netcat, we looked\nat Wireshark and we've looked at In-Map.\n\n22\n00:00:55.543 --> 00:00:59.275\nAnd you might think, you can't get\ntoo far with just those tools.\n\n23\n00:00:59.275 --> 00:01:02.650\nAnd most of the time,\nyou would probably be correct.\n\n24\n00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.620\nI mean, it's usually not\ngonna be quite that easy but\n\n25\n00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.110\nwe never wanna rule out anything.\n\n26\n00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.310\nWhen we're doing penetration testing,\nwhen we're doing security,\n\n27\n00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.450\nsecurity professional for organization.\n\n28\n00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.050\nWe wanna poke it everything,\n\n29\n00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.810\nwe want to test everything, leave no\ncorners unturned or no stones unturned.\n\n30\n00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.580\nTo see what we got cuz that's what the bad\nguys are gonna do, they're not going\n\n31\n00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.570\nto let me just skip that one,\nthere's no way they left that open, right?\n\n32\n00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.428\nNow the machine we're using\nis intentionally vulnerable,\n\n33\n00:01:32.428 --> 00:01:33.724\nit's Metasploitable 2.\n\n34\n00:01:33.724 --> 00:01:38.149\nIt's something you all can go out and\ndownload, and run in a virtual\n\n35\n00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.651\nenvironment to give you something\nto test your tool usage against and\n\n36\n00:01:42.651 --> 00:01:45.150\nyour skills as a penetration tester.\n\n37\n00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.280\nSo I will give you that this\nis intentionally vulnerable.\n\n38\n00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.510\nSome of these that you see you\nprobably won't see in the wild.\n\n39\n00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.570\nThere's always a chance but\nit's also more about the concepts that\n\n40\n00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.170\nwe're using versus the actual\nattack that we're doing.\n\n41\n00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.610\nAnd I'll explain that kinda as I go.\n\n42\n00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.210\nAll right, so in our previous episode\nwe used Nmap to gather information.\n\n43\n00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.910\nWe did our initial reconnaissance,\nif you will, of the network, right?\n\n44\n00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.140\nWe did a ping sweep, and we found\nall the live hosts on the network.\n\n45\n00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.323\nOnce we found all of our live hosts,\nwe turned around and\n\n46\n00:02:19.323 --> 00:02:22.320\nused Nmap again to do a port\nscan on those live hosts.\n\n47\n00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.890\nThat gives us our default scan to see\nwhat's out there, what those machines are.\n\n48\n00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.998\nAnd then we can turn around and do deeper\nscans on the machines we're focusing in on\n\n49\n00:02:32.998 --> 00:02:37.974\nas we're doing our penetration test or\nusing Kali as a security professional.\n\n50\n00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:41.924\nWe picked that 10.10.103, which again is\nmetasploitable got a lot of open ports and\n\n51\n00:02:41.924 --> 00:02:43.880\nI know there's some vulnerabilities there.\n\n52\n00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.440\nSo what we would do is we\nwould just start looking.\n\n53\n00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.310\nWell we'd look at our,\nwhat do we got the A scan there.\n\n54\n00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.699\nLets do that,\nlets take a look at this nmapAscan,\n\n55\n00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.295\nwhich we ran in our previous episode.\n\n56\n00:02:57.295 --> 00:03:01.994\nI'll blow that up a wee bit, and\nthis is the detailed scan, right,\n\n57\n00:03:01.994 --> 00:03:04.969\nof that host, 10.10.1.103.\n\n58\n00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.710\nAnd honestly, what you start doing is,\nyou start going in and\n\n59\n00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.565\nlooking at what's going on, all right?\n\n60\n00:03:09.565 --> 00:03:13.306\nOn 21, vsftpd, yeah, that's promising,\n\n61\n00:03:13.306 --> 00:03:16.850\nmost of these are actually-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Ver promising [LAUGH]\n\n62\n00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.091\n&gt;&gt; I was trying to make this exciting but\n\n63\n00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:23.138\nmost of these are really promising but,\nlet's take a look at one,\n\n64\n00:03:23.138 --> 00:03:26.480\nthe one that pops out to me\nfirst is this one right here.\n\n65\n00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.818\nThis is an oldy but a goody and\n\n66\n00:03:28.818 --> 00:03:34.285\nwe always want to try the simple\nbefore we try the complex, right?\n\n67\n00:03:34.285 --> 00:03:36.230\n&gt;&gt; Why put the cart before the horse.\n\n68\n00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.240\nWhy try to do the most difficult\nthing in your toolkit.\n\n69\n00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.755\nCool as it may be,\nwhy try to go that route first.\n\n70\n00:03:41.755 --> 00:03:44.165\nPersonally, had to do with\nsomething a whole lot easier.\n\n71\n00:03:44.165 --> 00:03:47.125\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right,\nthey always go with the easy stuff first.\n\n72\n00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:49.010\nYou might not get what you want but\nyou might and\n\n73\n00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.727\nthen you can stop right there and\nyou don't have to go any further.\n\n74\n00:03:51.727 --> 00:03:52.617\n&gt;&gt; It's all about time saving.\n\n75\n00:03:52.617 --> 00:03:53.980\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Because if you're doing this as\n\n76\n00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.045\na job, right?\n\n77\n00:03:55.045 --> 00:03:57.615\nI wanna root this box and\nI wanna get to the next box.\n\n78\n00:03:57.615 --> 00:03:59.658\nI wanna build my report,\nI've got to turn that in and\n\n79\n00:03:59.658 --> 00:04:01.339\nyou've got time constraints around you.\n\n80\n00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:03.045\nYou're gonna sleep sometime, right?\n\n81\n00:04:03.045 --> 00:04:05.980\nMaybe you have a family,\nthis is a job eventually.\n\n82\n00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.200\nSo you wanna be able to speed\nthings up as much as possible.\n\n83\n00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.720\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so lets take a look what\nI would do, is if I wasn't familiar\n\n84\n00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.560\nwith that already from other exercises and\ntest that we've done.\n\n85\n00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.398\nI'll break up my browser, right?\n\n86\n00:04:20.398 --> 00:04:22.740\nI'll say, okay, what the heck is this?\n\n87\n00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.807\nLooks interesting, so we're gonna say,\nlog in 513 was that port number there.\n\n88\n00:04:29.807 --> 00:04:30.792\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 513.\n\n89\n00:04:30.792 --> 00:04:35.817\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, if just add a little\nport 513, make sure we get,\n\n90\n00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:40.950\nokay, so I see a lot of results that\nhave to do with our rlogin, right?\n\n91\n00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:48.700\nI see rlogin, rlogin, what is a port scan,\nblah,blah, blah, there's a login protocol.\n\n92\n00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.433\nSo it sounds like it's rlogin, right?\n\n93\n00:04:51.433 --> 00:04:53.050\nSo let's take a look, here's a good one.\n\n94\n00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.450\nPenetration test labs,\nWikipedia, that's open source,\n\n95\n00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.240\nI don't have to worry about anybody,\n[LAUGH] on our shows.\n\n96\n00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.949\nI have to be careful about what\nI show because I don't wanna use\n\n97\n00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:03.784\nanybody's information commercially.\n\n98\n00:05:03.784 --> 00:05:07.920\nSo I'm gonna go with rlogin In\nthe real world I'd dive into forums.\n\n99\n00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.340\nI would dive into blogs and I would\ndo research on what the heck this is.\n\n100\n00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.295\nHere I can see rlogin is\na software utility for\n\n101\n00:05:15.295 --> 00:05:19.000\nUnix-like operating systems distributed\nas part of the, yada, yada, yada.\n\n102\n00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.383\nWe keep on reading-\n&gt;&gt; Security,\n\n103\n00:05:22.383 --> 00:05:23.097\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n104\n00:05:23.097 --> 00:05:27.840\nit says rlogin has several\nserious security issues.\n\n105\n00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.131\nAll information is unencrypted, all right,\n\n106\n00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:33.554\nthat's a bad that that means they\ncan sit there and monitor traffic.\n\n107\n00:05:33.554 --> 00:05:35.342\nAnd see if anybody's using that port and\n\n108\n00:05:35.342 --> 00:05:38.630\nif they've got that port open they're\nprobably using it for something.\n\n109\n00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.728\nSo I'm gonna set up some monitoring and\njust let it go to town and\n\n110\n00:05:41.728 --> 00:05:44.721\nhope I catch somebody submitting\ncredentials, all right?\n\n111\n00:05:44.721 --> 00:05:48.169\nEasy to misuse allowing\nlogins without passwords.\n\n112\n00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.060\nInteresting and\nI'll save you the nitty gritty details.\n\n113\n00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.120\nYou would do your normal research and\nyou would find out that our login based,\n\n114\n00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.030\nall the security is done on\nthe client side of things.\n\n115\n00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.145\nTelling the service who it is and\nwhether or not it's authorized?\n\n116\n00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:05.555\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which, yeah.\n\n117\n00:06:05.555 --> 00:06:08.157\n&gt;&gt; Several serious security\nproblems with our login, Michael.\n\n118\n00:06:08.157 --> 00:06:09.983\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, back in the day we could trust\n\n119\n00:06:09.983 --> 00:06:12.933\neverybody and\neverything that might have been fine, but-\n\n120\n00:06:12.933 --> 00:06:14.271\n&gt;&gt; With all 12 people that run\n\n121\n00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:16.062\nthe Internet back in the day, right?\n\n122\n00:06:16.062 --> 00:06:16.923\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n123\n00:06:16.923 --> 00:06:19.527\nwhen it was just our\nfanity our do whatever...\n\n124\n00:06:19.527 --> 00:06:23.194\nYeah, that might have worked,\njust by not gonna work anymore.\n\n125\n00:06:23.194 --> 00:06:25.660\nWe cannot trust who is\nmaking that connection.\n\n126\n00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.650\nTo be honest, tell us who they are.\n\n127\n00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.590\nThey can fake the information and\nmake that connections.\n\n128\n00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.710\nSo the next I might do is\nI might try to look up or\n\n129\n00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:42.430\nlog in if I can type and\ntalk at the same time.\n\n130\n00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.463\nI might do an rlogin vulnerability,\n\n131\n00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.490\nAll right, to see what I can find and\nagain, probably gonna find some.\n\n132\n00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.470\nNormally, what I try to do is go back to\none of the exploit databases like CVE or\n\n133\n00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.140\nExploit DB or something like that,\nget some additional information.\n\n134\n00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.390\nThat's gonna be really key when you\nstart getting into the more complex\n\n135\n00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.720\nexploits that we wanna take advantage of.\n\n136\n00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.720\nOur login however is\nreally straight forward.\n\n137\n00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.340\nIt allows you to authenticate\nwithout a password, let's try it,\n\n138\n00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.468\nlet's see if we can hit rlogin.\n\n139\n00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:21.340\nSo I'm gonna come back\nover here to my prompt,\n\n140\n00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.820\nwe'll clear that screen up a little bit.\n\n141\n00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.850\nAnd I'm just gonna type in our login.\n\n142\n00:07:26.932 --> 00:07:27.910\nJust to see what we get.\n\n143\n00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.720\nAnd what I see is that Kali Linux\ndoes not have an rlogin client.\n\n144\n00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.090\nYou'll see that I get usage ssh,\nokay, that's not good.\n\n145\n00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:39.930\nSo we would go out,\n\n146\n00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.470\nwe would Google rlogin and\ntry to figure what package I can get in.\n\n147\n00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.696\nAnd I can go out of the repository,\n\n148\n00:07:46.696 --> 00:07:51.821\napt-get install and\nfind rlog on client, all right?\n\n149\n00:07:51.821 --> 00:07:54.890\nBut what's going on with this,\n\n150\n00:07:54.890 --> 00:08:00.810\nthe Shoot I've lost my train of thought,\nlet me roll it back.\n\n151\n00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.300\nSo yes we would go out there and we would\nsee that r login was actually part of\n\n152\n00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.550\na package that we need to install\nit's not in here by default.\n\n153\n00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.690\nAnd what Kali is doing is saying hey\nwe didn't put r login on there because.\n\n154\n00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.520\n&gt;&gt; Because it's bad.\n\n155\n00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.570\n&gt;&gt; It is very bad and you should use SSH,\n\n156\n00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.610\nthis is why SSH actually comes up\n&gt;&gt; When you type in our login but\n\n157\n00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.110\nthat's not what we wanna use,\nwe wanna use r login.\n\n158\n00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:26.230\nSo let's try it we're gonna do an apt-get\n\n159\n00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.840\ninstall and it is actually an rsh-client.\n\n160\n00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:35.280\nAll right then we'll go ahead and\nrun that and let that install again.\n\n161\n00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.580\nA little bit of research on\nthe web trying to figure out why\n\n162\n00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.170\nr login doesn't come up\nwhen I type it in my prompt\n\n163\n00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:45.080\nwill key you into the fact that it's part\nof a package that you need to install.\n\n164\n00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.660\nInstall it and\nyou should have that command available.\n\n165\n00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:51.721\n&gt;&gt; That's one thing I like about when we\ndo these tech skills kinda shows is that\n\n166\n00:08:51.721 --> 00:08:53.255\nit really is like real life.\n\n167\n00:08:53.255 --> 00:08:55.865\nIn real life you're gonna in\nreal life go search the web and\n\n168\n00:08:55.865 --> 00:08:59.343\nfind interesting information about this\nif you were trying to exploit this.\n\n169\n00:08:59.343 --> 00:09:00.836\nNot like a certification\nwhere they're like,\n\n170\n00:09:00.836 --> 00:09:03.440\nwell you have to know the least\nadministrative effort and blah blah blah.\n\n171\n00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.650\nYou know in real life\nland I Google something,\n\n172\n00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.730\nin real life land I'm reading\na forum in real life land,\n\n173\n00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:12.190\nI'm reading a man page cuz I don't\nknow everything about everything.\n\n174\n00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.310\nAnd even if I could do that,\nI'm not gonna remember everything.\n\n175\n00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.070\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n176\n00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.080\n&gt;&gt; This is real life.\n\n177\n00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.680\n&gt;&gt; Preparation is where you\nspend most of your time.\n\n178\n00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.290\nIt's not as glamorous as they make\nit out to be sometimes, right?\n\n179\n00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.080\n&gt;&gt; No, it's a lot of work.\n\n180\n00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.790\n&gt;&gt; It is a lot of work.\n\n181\n00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:25.520\nAll right, so\n\n182\n00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.256\nnow that I've got that installed, let's\nsee what happens when I type in r login.\n\n183\n00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.990\nThere we go I got my users r log in,\n\n184\n00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:38.700\ngot a few optional things,\nuser, user, port, host.\n\n185\n00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.020\nSounds pretty straightforward\nlet's see what happens,\n\n186\n00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:45.660\nr login-l\n&gt;&gt; Leguine?\n\n187\n00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.980\n&gt;&gt; And l for user and what's that?\n\n188\n00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.150\n&gt;&gt; It says R Leguine.\n\n189\n00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.630\n&gt;&gt; Does it thank you [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Always\n\n190\n00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.030\nnice to have two sets of\neyes on the screen isn't it?\n\n191\n00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:56.770\n&gt;&gt; It really does.\n\n192\n00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.676\n&gt;&gt; Our login to shell,\nheck let's try root,\n\n193\n00:09:59.676 --> 00:10:03.713\nright I know they've got a root\naccount on a Linux machine,\n\n194\n00:10:03.713 --> 00:10:08.343\n10.10.1.1.103, and\nthen we'll see what happens.\n\n195\n00:10:08.343 --> 00:10:09.165\n&gt;&gt; It's thinking about it.\n\n196\n00:10:09.165 --> 00:10:12.560\n&gt;&gt; It's thinking, it's reaching out\n&gt;&gt; Saying hello are you there?\n\n197\n00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.750\n&gt;&gt; Are you really root?\n\n198\n00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.220\n&gt;&gt; Maybe you are can you log in?\n\n199\n00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.450\n&gt;&gt; You say you are.\n\n200\n00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.805\n&gt;&gt; Badda bing if you take\na look at my prompt root.\n\n201\n00:10:19.805 --> 00:10:20.702\n&gt;&gt; It has changed.\n\n202\n00:10:20.702 --> 00:10:25.740\n&gt;&gt; At Metasploitable, this is the login\nthe message of the day on that\n\n203\n00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.310\nMetasploitable, that\nUbuntu system over there.\n\n204\n00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.890\nIf I do host name we could\nsee it's Metasploitable,\n\n205\n00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.510\nif I do who am I, we see it's root.\n\n206\n00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:41.420\nIf I do an ID I can see I'm root again\njust verifying all right where am I,\n\n207\n00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.980\nwho am I, what rights do I have?\n\n208\n00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.391\n&gt;&gt; That shadow right.\n\n209\n00:10:44.391 --> 00:10:45.051\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I was gonna say so\n\n210\n00:10:45.051 --> 00:10:46.977\nat this point what's the first\nthing we're gonna do Daniel?\n\n211\n00:10:46.977 --> 00:10:51.547\n[LAUGH] It's shadow and\nthere is a nice file of\n\n212\n00:10:51.547 --> 00:10:55.878\npasswords that we can now start to crack.\n\n213\n00:10:55.878 --> 00:11:00.840\nSo at this point,\nwe'll do whatever we want.\n\n214\n00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.790\nWe are root, so\nit's limitless what you can do.\n\n215\n00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.200\nSo I don't think there's any\npoint of going on any further.\n\n216\n00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.540\nRoot is typically the end of the line.\n\n217\n00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And now you're like,\n\n218\n00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.880\nokay, I'm at the top I'll\njust start taking files,\n\n219\n00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:17.890\ncracking passwords offline, doing whatever\nI want to this machine, I own it.\n\n220\n00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.830\nMost likely creating a backdoor\naccount that I can add to the root\n\n221\n00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.782\nto pseudo group it or something and keep\ngoing from there, hopefully unnoticed.\n\n222\n00:11:24.782 --> 00:11:27.475\nAll right, easy enough for\n\n223\n00:11:27.475 --> 00:11:32.070\nr login that one was almost too\neasy like I said, everybody knows\n\n224\n00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:36.280\nabout that most likely you're not gonna\nfind that on any systems out there.\n\n225\n00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.400\nBut hey if you do a port scan and\n\n226\n00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.571\nyou see 513 open and it says log on\nquestion mark next to it get excited.\n\n227\n00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:43.390\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Because\n\n228\n00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.548\nnow you pretty much know\nyou own that machine.\n\n229\n00:11:45.548 --> 00:11:49.370\nAll right so let's pull up our scan\nwe did in a previous episode and\n\n230\n00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.960\nsee what else we can find on this machine.\n\n231\n00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.120\nLet me just verify I'm\nin the right place here.\n\n232\n00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:02.310\nWe're going to cat that nmap scan and\nwe'll take a look at what we've got.\n\n233\n00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:06.900\nAnother one that piques my interest.\n\n234\n00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.980\n&gt;&gt; They all pique your interest.\n\n235\n00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.328\n&gt;&gt; They do, they all pique my interest.\n\n236\n00:12:09.328 --> 00:12:12.760\nWhat you're gonna do as a penetration\ntester or a security professional\n\n237\n00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.020\nis look up each one and go, let me go\ntake a look at what this is by 9.4.2.\n\n238\n00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.210\nLet's take a look at this one,\nsee what this is.\n\n239\n00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:23.970\nAnd see which one, as we said earlier,\n\n240\n00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.720\nmight be the easiest way in cuz\nthat's really what we're looking for.\n\n241\n00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.960\nAnd after doing a little bit of research,\n\n242\n00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:35.404\nthis one will probably stick\nout at you vsftpd 2.3.4.\n\n243\n00:12:35.404 --> 00:12:42.176\nSo ftp on port 21 and in particular,\nit says vsftpd 2.3.4.\n\n244\n00:12:42.176 --> 00:12:44.370\nI don't know anything about that.\n\n245\n00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:44.870\nOkay, great.\n\n246\n00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.020\nWhat is that?\n\n247\n00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:46.810\nLet's find out.\n\n248\n00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.570\nLet's take that information.\n\n249\n00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.514\n&gt;&gt; We'll even n map says\nright there is saying,\n\n250\n00:12:50.514 --> 00:12:52.210\nwell there's some anonymous logins.\n\n251\n00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:56.300\nSo you could at least log in into\nthe server, you know that much about it.\n\n252\n00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.510\nAnonymously, you don't need a valid\nusername and password just username,\n\n253\n00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.470\nanonymous password,\nanonymous and you're in and\n\n254\n00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.140\nthen you can start at\nleast touching the system.\n\n255\n00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah maybe escalating your credentials,\ntrying to figure out where to go next.\n\n256\n00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:12.070\nLet's see if we can find\nanything juicy about this.\n\n257\n00:13:14.466 --> 00:13:16.290\nWell, wow how about that?\n\n258\n00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:17.397\n&gt;&gt; How about that?\n\n259\n00:13:17.397 --> 00:13:23.540\n&gt;&gt; First one in the list: VSFTPD version\n2.3.4 back door command execution.\n\n260\n00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.140\nI like that.\n\n261\n00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.770\n&gt;&gt; That seems promising, Micheal.\n\n262\n00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:26.300\n&gt;&gt; Yes it does.\n\n263\n00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:30.490\nA back door being a way to go\naround the front door, right?\n\n264\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.650\nAvoid the normal authentication and\nsee what we can get.\n\n265\n00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:35.710\nSome way to get into that system, there.\n\n266\n00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.710\nAll right now, while I'm not going to sit\nhere and do the research on screen or\n\n267\n00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:42.723\nanything like that, what you'll\nfind out is that back in the day,\n\n268\n00:13:42.723 --> 00:13:46.325\nvsfpd they had their\nsource code compromised.\n\n269\n00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:49.470\nSomebody got onto the place\nwhere they were, the repository,\n\n270\n00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.640\nwhere the were making\nthis code available and\n\n271\n00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:56.070\nthey inserted some malware as a back\ndoor a little bit of code in there.\n\n272\n00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.580\nAnd I think it lasts like three or\nfour days or\n\n273\n00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:01.450\nsomething like that before somebody\ndiscovered it and they removed it.\n\n274\n00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:06.300\nIt's a long story about did they do it and\nyou know, and\n\n275\n00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.059\nwe won't go into the details there but\nthe point is.\n\n276\n00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.060\nThis is your basic strategy, right?\n\n277\n00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.270\nYou're looking at that service, that\nversion information and now we're gonna go\n\n278\n00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:19.970\nand see what we can find out about that\nparticular version, this one sounds good.\n\n279\n00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:25.160\nAnd what it turns out to be is if\nyou put a smiley face, a colon,\n\n280\n00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.870\nif you actually look at the code you can\nsee the hex values that it's looking for.\n\n281\n00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.780\nAnd if you decode the hex values and\nit turns out to be a smiley face.\n\n282\n00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:36.770\nSo if you put a username,\nfollowed with no spaces.\n\n283\n00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:42.660\nYour username, colon,\nclose parenthesis make the smiley face and\n\n284\n00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.400\nthen it doesn't matter\nwhat password you type in.\n\n285\n00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:50.172\nIt would actually spawn a shell\non port 6,200 just waiting for\n\n286\n00:14:50.172 --> 00:14:55.070\nyou to connec and giving you system\naccess and so, let's try it.\n\n287\n00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.602\nLet's see if we can\ntake advantage of that.\n\n288\n00:14:56.602 --> 00:15:01.470\nAll right so I'm gonna up our shell on\nmy attack machine on our Kali box, and\n\n289\n00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.515\nI'm gonna telnet over\nthe port 10.10.1.103.21.\n\n290\n00:15:04.515 --> 00:15:10.208\nAnd it's gonna ask me to authenticate,\n\n291\n00:15:10.208 --> 00:15:15.590\nso I'm gonna put user, and then you can\nput anything you want any username,\n\n292\n00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:20.760\nput something and then colon close\nparenthesis, make your smiley face.\n\n293\n00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.590\nAnd then it's gonna\nspecify the password so\n\n294\n00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:29.490\nwe'll type in pass and then anything you\nwant asdf 1234 whatever the case may be.\n\n295\n00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:33.020\nAnd when you hit enter after the pass\nyou'll see that it just hangs there for\n\n296\n00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.150\na second or\nit doesn't look like it's doing anything.\n\n297\n00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.736\nDon't touch it,\nleave it right where it is.\n\n298\n00:15:37.736 --> 00:15:42.519\nOpen up a new shell because the\nvulnerability says once you log in with\n\n299\n00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:47.714\na smiley face semicolon in the username\nfield at the end of username field,\n\n300\n00:15:47.714 --> 00:15:52.332\nif you actually look at the code for\nthe malware that got injected,\n\n301\n00:15:52.332 --> 00:15:56.949\nthere's a line that says if you find\nthese two characters at the end\n\n302\n00:15:56.949 --> 00:16:00.284\nof the username Spawn\na shell on port 6200.\n\n303\n00:16:00.284 --> 00:16:01.700\nThis is the back door.\n\n304\n00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.790\nSo, we've hopefully spawned the shell\nby triggering it with the colon,\n\n305\n00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.188\nclose parenthesis.\n\n306\n00:16:08.188 --> 00:16:09.436\nSo, let's see if it connects.\n\n307\n00:16:09.436 --> 00:16:14.892\nAnd see 10.10.1.103 6200 is\nthe port it's supposed to spawn on,\n\n308\n00:16:14.892 --> 00:16:19.720\nand I hit enter, and it doesn't\nlook like anything is happening.\n\n309\n00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.820\nBut that's the way it is\nwith some reverse shells,\n\n310\n00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:26.560\nsometimes in shells they don't seem that\nresponsive, but if I type in host name,\n\n311\n00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.740\nyou'll see I am connected to\nMetasploitable on port 6200,\n\n312\n00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:37.200\nand if I do an ID, I am root, right,\nwhich is always a good thing.\n\n313\n00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.587\nAll right, so now that I am root on\nMetasploitable, what could we do?\n\n314\n00:16:40.587 --> 00:16:44.607\nWell, I tell you one thing I would like to\ndo is get a hold of their password file,\n\n315\n00:16:44.607 --> 00:16:47.967\nright, their shadow file,\nbecause I can take that back offline,\n\n316\n00:16:47.967 --> 00:16:52.167\ntry to crack passwords, see what other\naccounts I can compromise, maybe services\n\n317\n00:16:52.167 --> 00:16:56.010\nthat might be using the same password\non other machines, things like that.\n\n318\n00:16:56.010 --> 00:17:00.860\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz the administrators of this\nmachine might just not roll out the update\n\n319\n00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:05.030\nfor this yet, and they and then they\ndo an update, and this entry is gone.\n\n320\n00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so you need other ways to get in.\n\n321\n00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:11.340\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, so what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna try to use Netcat to set up\n\n322\n00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:16.210\na little one-page web server and host\ntheir own shadow file on their machine for\n\n323\n00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.530\nthem, or for us, I guess I should say.\n\n324\n00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:22.917\nSo that's gonna be, while true; do nc, and\n\n325\n00:17:22.917 --> 00:17:27.997\nwe're gonna setup a listener on port 9999,\nand\n\n326\n00:17:27.997 --> 00:17:33.654\nyou could pick whatever port\nthat wasn't in use, -q1,\n\n327\n00:17:33.654 --> 00:17:39.785\nwhich is supposed to limit how\nmany people can connect to this.\n\n328\n00:17:39.785 --> 00:17:41.235\nDoesn't seem to work all that well.\n\n329\n00:17:41.235 --> 00:17:45.123\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And then I'm gonna host the file,\n\n330\n00:17:45.123 --> 00:17:51.872\n/etc/shadow, which we know on a Linux\nsystem is where all passwords are stored.\n\n331\n00:17:51.872 --> 00:17:55.610\nAnd then I'll put ;,\nspace, done, hit Enter.\n\n332\n00:17:55.610 --> 00:18:01.400\nSo now I should have a web server running\non port 9999, hosting their shadow file.\n\n333\n00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.150\nSo I'm gonna grab another shell,\nso I wanna leave my terminal,\n\n334\n00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.090\nmy FTP connection, open, right?\n\n335\n00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:13.324\nLeaving this one open, open up another\nshell, and now I'm going to connect.\n\n336\n00:18:13.324 --> 00:18:18.770\nI'm just gonna use nc 10.10.1.103.\n\n337\n00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:24.110\nAnd we use port 9999, then hit Enter,\nand boom, there's their shadow file.\n\n338\n00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.510\nThey're serving up their\nown shadow file for me.\n\n339\n00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.170\nWell, I guess I did it for them.\n\n340\n00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:29.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n341\n00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.590\n&gt;&gt; Now, that's great,\n\n342\n00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:31.530\ndoesn't do me a lot of good.\n\n343\n00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:35.921\nLet's do that one more time,\nand pipe that out to shadow.\n\n344\n00:18:38.996 --> 00:18:43.570\nNow if we take a look,\nthere is a new file called shadow.\n\n345\n00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:49.360\nIf I cat shadow,\nif I could spell shadow, there it is.\n\n346\n00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.240\nSo now I've got there shadow file, I can\ntake this to my password crackers, and\n\n347\n00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.560\nI can go to town.\n\n348\n00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.696\nNow all because, remember,\nall we did, we started with Nmap,\n\n349\n00:18:57.696 --> 00:19:01.560\nwe found a port that was running\na service, we googled that service,\n\n350\n00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.760\nwe found that it had a known\nvulnerability, we did our research,\n\n351\n00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.390\nhow to take advantage of\nthe vulnerability, and we did it.\n\n352\n00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:08.560\nWe're in.\n\n353\n00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.550\n&gt;&gt; Very cool stuff, Mike.\n\n354\n00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:12.560\nThis is a very simplistic example of it,\nbut\n\n355\n00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.890\na very good example when it comes to\nthe methodology that you're going to use\n\n356\n00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.177\nwhen it comes to trying some sort of\nsecurity testing, penetration testing.\n\n357\n00:19:20.177 --> 00:19:23.940\nFollowing that procedure, scanning,\nfinding the host, looking at the host,\n\n358\n00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.660\nwhat is available inside that host,\nlook, there's a known vulnerability for\n\n359\n00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:31.530\nthat host, researching that and\nthen moving into exploitation, and\n\n360\n00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.960\nfrom there, elevating privileges or\nwhat else you needed to do.\n\n361\n00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.870\nVery good stuff.\n\n362\n00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:39.910\nMike, anything else that we need to\nknow when it comes to using what you've\n\n363\n00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:40.970\ntaught us so far?\n\n364\n00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.318\n&gt;&gt; No, I think just maybe reiterating\nwhat you were saying there,\n\n365\n00:19:44.318 --> 00:19:47.232\nand what I want to make sure\nwe're taking advantage of,\n\n366\n00:19:47.232 --> 00:19:50.332\ncuz I know some of you sitting out there,\nthinking, well,\n\n367\n00:19:50.332 --> 00:19:55.045\nnobody out there is running VSFTPD 2.3.4,\nso what good does this really do us?\n\n368\n00:19:55.045 --> 00:19:58.685\nAnd that's not where, I'm not here to\nteach you how to take advantage of that\n\n369\n00:19:58.685 --> 00:20:00.397\nparticular vulnerability.\n\n370\n00:20:00.397 --> 00:20:04.087\nIt's that, as you said, the methodology\nthat we're learning, we're scanning\n\n371\n00:20:04.087 --> 00:20:08.917\nsystems where we don't know anything about\nthem, we're researching that service, and\n\n372\n00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:13.467\nif VSFTP wasn't there, or if it was some\nservice, or a patched version of it,\n\n373\n00:20:13.467 --> 00:20:16.107\nthen I would've moved on to the next\nservice, and I would've googled that.\n\n374\n00:20:16.107 --> 00:20:20.830\nSo, it's really about enumeration,\nfinding, researching, and\n\n375\n00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.170\nthen trying to exploit.\n\n376\n00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:23.060\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n377\n00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.080\nAll right, Mike, cool,\nvery cool stuff, right?\n\n378\n00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.460\nWe did get to see a box get rooted,\nwhich is always a fun, good time.\n\n379\n00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:33.720\nIt feels good inside to do a who am I and\nit says, who you, you are root.\n\n380\n00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.370\nYes, it does feel good for the soul.\n\n381\n00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:38.870\nSo we do thank you for showing us how\nwe use the methods of what you've been\n\n382\n00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:43.066\nshowing us to actually move through\nfrom discovery to exploitation.\n\n383\n00:20:43.066 --> 00:20:47.900\nSo use that, assimilate that, understand\nthat that's how this works, and you have\n\n384\n00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:52.290\nto be patient and as we always have been\nsaying, enumerate as much as possible.\n\n385\n00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.500\nIt's gonna help you In exploitation.\n\n386\n00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.500\nAll right, Mike, it look likes\nwe're out of time for this episode.\n\n387\n00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.890\nWe do thank you for dropping by, we thank\nour good audience out there for watching.\n\n388\n00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:00.750\nHope you've enjoyed it.\n\n389\n00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.890\nSigning off for ITPro TV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n390\n00:21:03.890 -->

00:00:10.248\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.248 --> 00:00:14.008\n&gt;&gt; Hello, and thank you for\nchoosing ITPro.TV,\n\n5\n00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:17.360\nhelping you learn wherever you go.\n\n6\n00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.680\nI'm your host Zack Memos as we continue on\nwith becoming a Linux Server Administrator\n\n7\n00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.240\ngreat series and today we're gonna be\nlooking at configuring system logging.\n\n8\n00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.029\nAwesome stuff and Don Pezet is gonna\nbe bringing us all the information we\n\n9\n00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.776\nneed because he knows what to do.\n\n10\n00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:35.132\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well,\n\n11\n00:00:35.132 --> 00:00:37.160\nhopefully I know what to do.\n\n12\n00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.180\nI know what to do in large\npart thanks to logging, right.\n\n13\n00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.580\nLogging is kind of a critical\nsystem on our servers.\n\n14\n00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.440\nIt's critical on workstations too but\non servers even more so.\n\n15\n00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.988\nBecause nobody is sitting\nat a server 24 hours a day.\n\n16\n00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:52.530\nI'm sitting in front of\nmy laptop right now.\n\n17\n00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.430\nIf I get an error on my laptop,\nI'll see it.\n\n18\n00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.008\nBut a server, it's in a rack in another\nroom, maybe even in another country.\n\n19\n00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:00.310\nI'm not going to see the errors\npop up on the screen.\n\n20\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.120\nSo we rely upon logs every single day\nto be able to find out what's going on.\n\n21\n00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.060\nIf a failure occurred what caused it,\nhow do we troubleshoot?\n\n22\n00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.980\nHow do we just monitor\nthe health of a server?\n\n23\n00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.390\nAll of that is tied to logging.\n\n24\n00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.399\nAnd when you start spinning servers\nup in an enterprise environment,\n\n25\n00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.746\nthere is some logging that's\nconfigured by default.\n\n26\n00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:23.611\nBut there's a lot of logging that we need\nto get in and configure ourselves, and\n\n27\n00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:27.250\nget set up, and get kind of working\nthe way that we want it to work.\n\n28\n00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.660\nIn order to make sure we've got\nthe information when we need it,\n\n29\n00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.010\nbecause there's nothing worse then\nall of a sudden having a failure and\n\n30\n00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.220\nrealizing you didn't\nhave logging turned on.\n\n31\n00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.500\nAnd so you're like, I really could use\nsome logs, I could turn them on now.\n\n32\n00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.713\nBut it's not gonna help you,\nbecause now it's after the failure.\n\n33\n00:01:41.713 --> 00:01:45.060\nSo logging is one of those things that\nwe need to get set up before we need it,\n\n34\n00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.030\nnot after we need it.\n\n35\n00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.877\nAnd that's what we're gonna see\nright here in this episode.\n\n36\n00:01:48.877 --> 00:01:51.490\n&gt;&gt; Well Don, don't we already\nhave logging on the server?\n\n37\n00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.880\nIsn't it automatic?\n\n38\n00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.168\n&gt;&gt; Well, to an extent, yes.\n\n39\n00:01:55.168 --> 00:02:00.170\nAlmost every Linux distribution\nout there has logging enabled, and\n\n40\n00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.510\nhas it configured in a way that's\nsuitable for most people right?\n\n41\n00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.480\nAnd I say almost every, and that's because\nthere's a lot of distributions out there\n\n42\n00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.430\nthat are specialized, right?\n\n43\n00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.560\nLike the live CD distributions where\nthey're expecting you to boot off a CD and\n\n44\n00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.620\nrun Linux right from the CD.\n\n45\n00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.090\nWell, if you're doing that,\ncan it write logs to the CD?\n\n46\n00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.260\nNo, it's a write once media.\n\n47\n00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.270\nSo it can write logs to memory, but\nwhen it reboots, all the logs are gone.\n\n48\n00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.100\nAnd so, those systems\nare a little bit special, right.\n\n49\n00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.420\nWell, we're not gonna\nuse those on a server.\n\n50\n00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.590\nWell, not typically, but maybe you will.\n\n51\n00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.430\nBut for most of us we're gonna\nhave more traditional servers.\n\n52\n00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.860\nAnd on a traditional system\nyou'll find that logging is\n\n53\n00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.980\nactually enabled by default.\n\n54\n00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.670\nSome that we've already\nused in this series right?\n\n55\n00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.155\nFor example when you boot up you\nuse the d message system, right?\n\n56\n00:02:42.155 --> 00:02:46.220\nYou'll see a lot of text scrolling\nacross your screen when you boot up.\n\n57\n00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.730\nAnd that log, or it is logged and stored\nand we can view that log using dmsg.\n\n58\n00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.270\nSo if I run dmsg I get a huge amount of\ninformation flowing across my screen.\n\n59\n00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.463\nThese are all the boot messages\nthat were related to hardware.\n\n60\n00:02:58.463 --> 00:03:01.896\nSo If I'm troubleshooting a server trying\nto figure out why a piece of hardware\n\n61\n00:03:01.896 --> 00:03:04.260\nwasn't detected or something didn't work.\n\n62\n00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.572\nI can run right through here, and\nlook and try and find it and see.\n\n63\n00:03:07.572 --> 00:03:11.641\nIt did detect the hardware but\nit didn't initialize the driver or so on.\n\n64\n00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:14.945\nAll of that information is gonna\nspread right there inside dmessage.\n\n65\n00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:18.577\nNow Dmessage is a command\nthat's displaying you a log and\n\n66\n00:03:18.577 --> 00:03:23.190\nwhat we'll find is that most logs\nare tucked away in the same place.\n\n67\n00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.020\nYou have a folder which is /var/log.\n\n68\n00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.384\nAnd the majority of your systems are gonna\nbe logging to here now I'm logged in as\n\n69\n00:03:31.384 --> 00:03:35.424\na regular user right now and a regular\nuser will have access to some logs and\n\n70\n00:03:35.424 --> 00:03:37.005\nnot access to others right?\n\n71\n00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:40.258\nSo some of these logs are protected\nespecially when we get into things like\n\n72\n00:03:40.258 --> 00:03:42.410\nthe audit logs that SE Linux uses right?\n\n73\n00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.890\nSo as you poke around on these logs\nyou may need to elevate privileges.\n\n74\n00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.000\nFor d message for those boot logs all\nit's doing is displaying this text file\n\n75\n00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.940\nright here d message right?\n\n76\n00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.430\nBut notice there's another one,\nD message.old.\n\n77\n00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.731\nEvery time you reboot the current\nboot log is put in d message and\n\n78\n00:03:58.731 --> 00:04:02.153\nthe previous boot log is\nput into d message.old.\n\n79\n00:04:02.153 --> 00:04:06.810\nSo maybe I successfully booted last\ntime and I failed to boot this time.\n\n80\n00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.390\nI can compare the two and\nsee what's different right, so\n\n81\n00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.750\nthat makes things really useful.\n\n82\n00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.520\nThey're just text files stored right here.\n\n83\n00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.750\nAnd the dmesg command is not\nmuch different than doing\n\n84\n00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.510\nsomething like saying less,\nor cat, or more,\n\n85\n00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.405\n/var/log/dmesg and going in and\nlooking that data right?\n\n86\n00:04:25.405 --> 00:04:27.881\nSo it's really basically the same thing.\n\n87\n00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:30.100\nAnd you can pull that information and\nsee it.\n\n88\n00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.980\nDon't really have to configure much.\n\n89\n00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.840\nSystem log is the same way.\n\n90\n00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.840\nEvery Unix system that has been deployed\nsince the 1970s is come with syslog.\n\n91\n00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.940\nSyslog is just short for system log.\n\n92\n00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.060\nAnd so all of the errors and\nother activity informational messages that\n\n93\n00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.350\nare being generated by my system are being\ncaught by syslog and written to a file.\n\n94\n00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.680\nNow on some distros,\nit's stored as /var/log/syslog.\n\n95\n00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.954\nBut in the Red Hat world or CentOS or\nFedora, It's /var/log/messages.\n\n96\n00:05:02.954 --> 00:05:06.010\nThat's where the syslog is\nstoring its information.\n\n97\n00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.467\nIf I take a look at that, I'll use less.\n\n98\n00:05:09.467 --> 00:05:16.460\nAnd I'll do /var/log/messages and\nI get permission denied right?\n\n99\n00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.330\nThis is a protected one.\n\n100\n00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.760\nYou need to be an administrator to use it,\nso\n\n101\n00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.850\nI'm gonna use the sudo command\nto get elevated privileges.\n\n102\n00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.880\nAnd then that way I'll be able to open\nthat file up, and go in and look.\n\n103\n00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.570\nAnd the reason is there might be\ninformation in here that somebody could\n\n104\n00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.510\nuse to potentially exploit the system.\n\n105\n00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.260\nSo this needs to be protected.\n\n106\n00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.040\nBut the main reason it's protected Is that\n\n107\n00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.660\nyou don't want regular users to be\nable to potentially modify this right.\n\n108\n00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.930\nWhat's a hacker gonna do if\nthey break into your system?\n\n109\n00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.150\nA hacker's first job is figuring\nout how to purge the logs.\n\n110\n00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.964\nIf they can purge the logs,\nthen they can cover their tracks.\n\n111\n00:05:49.964 --> 00:05:51.021\nAnd then they can do whatever they want.\n\n112\n00:05:51.021 --> 00:05:52.036\nThey don't even have to be careful.\n\n113\n00:05:52.036 --> 00:05:54.611\nThey can do whatever they want and\nuse a hammer.\n\n114\n00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:57.030\nAnd when they're done, they just clear\nthe logs and you don't even know it.\n\n115\n00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.780\nBut if they can't clear the logs,\nthey've gotta be really careful,\n\n116\n00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.520\nthey've gotta hide all their actions, and\nmake sure they're not able to be caught.\n\n117\n00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.900\nSo this is one of their primary targets,\nand that's why it's protected.\n\n118\n00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.730\nBut I can come in here,\nand I've got the logs,\n\n119\n00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.850\nall the information's right there,\njust ready for\n\n120\n00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.780\nme to peruse through and take a look at\nit, and figure out what I need to do.\n\n121\n00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.750\nSo it's all right there inside of syslog.\n\n122\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.085\n&gt;&gt; So these are already running, right?\n\n123\n00:06:19.085 --> 00:06:22.500\nIs there any configuration or\nmaintenance that we need to do?\n\n124\n00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.620\n&gt;&gt; Well, if I'm happy with that.\n\n125\n00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.878\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Then, no.\n\n126\n00:06:25.878 --> 00:06:26.935\nI could stop right there.\n\n127\n00:06:26.935 --> 00:06:27.579\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n\n128\n00:06:27.579 --> 00:06:29.267\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This could be the shortest\n\n129\n00:06:29.267 --> 00:06:29.809\nepisode ever, right?\n\n130\n00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:30.607\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n131\n00:06:30.607 --> 00:06:34.568\n&gt;&gt; But the reality is, there's things that\nwe are going to want to configure, right?\n\n132\n00:06:34.568 --> 00:06:38.984\nWith sys logs for example, the log\nmessages are gonna grow as more and\n\n133\n00:06:38.984 --> 00:06:42.640\nmore data gets written to the logs,\nthe logs will grow and\n\n134\n00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.550\neventually they get too\nbig to handle right.\n\n135\n00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.280\nTo open up the file in memory or\nwhatever, it's just too much.\n\n136\n00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.080\nThen so we'll typically want to\nset up what's called log rotation.\n\n137\n00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.400\nSome systems do this automatically,\nsome don't.\n\n138\n00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.770\nSo it's a good idea to double check your\ndistro and make sure that it is using it.\n\n139\n00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.930\nLog rotation just says at a set interval,\nI will take the log file and\n\n140\n00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.110\nI will split it off into a separate file,\nright.\n\n141\n00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.870\nSo, for example I might do\nthis daily where on Tuesday\n\n142\n00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.110\nthe system will take all the log messages\nfrom Monday and put them in a Monday file.\n\n143\n00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.446\nAnd then on Wednesday, it will take\nall the log messages from Tuesday and\n\n144\n00:07:16.446 --> 00:07:17.710\nput them in a Tuesday file.\n\n145\n00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:18.810\nAnd that way they're separated out.\n\n146\n00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.910\nAnd you get smaller files that\nare easier to deal with and\n\n147\n00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.410\nyou can purge the other things.\n\n148\n00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.380\nIf you don't know if your system is\nusing log rotation, you can look for\n\n149\n00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.580\nthe config file.\n\n150\n00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.900\nThis one is stored inside of ETC.\n\n151\n00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:35.530\nSo if I go into /etc and\njust take a look in there,\n\n152\n00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:39.210\nthe file that manages the configuration\nis called log rotate.\n\n153\n00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.513\nAnd so If I can remember my alphabet and\nfind the L's, there it is.\n\n154\n00:07:42.513 --> 00:07:45.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Log rotate dot com right?\n\n155\n00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.127\nSo that's the configuration file for\nlog rotation, and we can go in there and\n\n156\n00:07:48.127 --> 00:07:49.413\ntell it how we want to log rotate.\n\n157\n00:07:49.413 --> 00:07:53.160\nThere's also a folder called log rotate\ndot D, and you can put individual\n\n158\n00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.436\nfiles in there to dictate special\ncircumstances for rotating.\n\n159\n00:07:56.436 --> 00:07:59.066\nFor most people,\nthis file right here is the one we want.\n\n160\n00:07:59.066 --> 00:08:00.665\nSo, I'm going to edit that real quick.\n\n161\n00:08:00.665 --> 00:08:06.270\nLet me elevate to do that and so,\nwe're going to pull up that file.\n\n162\n00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.170\nYou'll see here where it's setting,\nwhen do we rotate?\n\n163\n00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.560\nMine's rotating weekly.\n\n164\n00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.730\nI might want to rotate daily to\nmake those log files more, so\n\n165\n00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.500\nI can change this from weekly to daily.\n\n166\n00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:20.370\nAnd then, I'm going to keep\nfour weeks worth of backlogs.\n\n167\n00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.032\nEach week,\nit'll splinter out the previous week.\n\n168\n00:08:23.032 --> 00:08:28.001\nAnd on the fifth week,\nit'll delete the oldest week to make room,\n\n169\n00:08:28.001 --> 00:08:31.296\nso it's never saving more than four weeks.\n\n170\n00:08:31.296 --> 00:08:34.642\nThat's the way that it's\nrotating right there.\n\n171\n00:08:34.642 --> 00:08:37.682\nNow I could change that behavior, there's\na lot of ways that you can tweak this.\n\n172\n00:08:37.682 --> 00:08:40.265\nAnd you'll see there's a ton\nof options in here for\n\n173\n00:08:40.265 --> 00:08:43.161\nmanipulating what happens,\nthe permissions and so on.\n\n174\n00:08:43.161 --> 00:08:45.927\nBut for most of us these first two options\nare the ones we're gonna care about.\n\n175\n00:08:45.927 --> 00:08:51.864\nSo I might want to set it to daily, and\nthen set it so that the rotate is 31.\n\n176\n00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:55.639\nSo I'm gonna do daily and\nkeep the last 31 days, I can set that up.\n\n177\n00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:58.686\nWe're setting the limit,\nand as things get older,\n\n178\n00:08:58.686 --> 00:09:01.050\nthey get overwritten by the newer data.\n\n179\n00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.220\nSo now, I don't have to worry\nabout my hard drive filling up.\n\n180\n00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.700\nSo the logs are gonna be a contained size.\n\n181\n00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.070\nAnd I also don't have to worry about\nthe files being too big to open,\n\n182\n00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:11.550\nI'll be able to open them and\nmanage them a little easier.\n\n183\n00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.556\nOn a negative side, I'm losing old data.\n\n184\n00:09:14.556 --> 00:09:17.050\nHere I'm keeping four weeks worth of logs.\n\n185\n00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.880\nLet's say a hacker gets in the system, and\n\n186\n00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.150\nit's like an APT,\nan advanced persistent threat.\n\n187\n00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.620\nAnd they've been in the system for\nsix months getting at data.\n\n188\n00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.400\nAnd so\nthe data forensics guys come to me and\n\n189\n00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.780\nsay Don,\nwe need the last six months worth of logs.\n\n190\n00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:36.605\nAnd I say you know I actually just saved\nfour weeks, so here's the four weeks,\n\n191\n00:09:36.605 --> 00:09:38.024\ngood luck and have at it.\n\n192\n00:09:38.024 --> 00:09:40.886\nSo, you need to make sure that whatever\ninterval you set up here matches\n\n193\n00:09:40.886 --> 00:09:42.610\nup with your company's security policy.\n\n194\n00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.420\nIf you need to retain logs for\na certain period of time,\n\n195\n00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.420\nyou need to mirror that here.\n\n196\n00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.832\nLog rotation is an important thing,\n\n197\n00:09:47.832 --> 00:09:49.889\ncuz you don't want your logs\ngrowing out of control.\n\n198\n00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:54.180\nWe've got to find a happy medium,\nbetween being secure and functioning.\n\n199\n00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.150\n[LAUGH] And so,\nthat's what log rotation is all about.\n\n200\n00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.567\n&gt;&gt; But, what if I don't want to delete\nthe logs and I want to keep them forever,\n\n201\n00:10:00.567 --> 00:10:01.410\nbecause I love them?\n\n202\n00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.447\n&gt;&gt; All right well, and\nyou know we say it jokingly, but\n\n203\n00:10:04.447 --> 00:10:06.669\nthere are some people that love that.\n\n204\n00:10:06.669 --> 00:10:10.761\nIn the EU they have certain privacy rules,\nand even here in the US where you have\n\n205\n00:10:10.761 --> 00:10:15.340\nmedical or a lot of hospitals, that are\nrequired to maintain data for ten years.\n\n206\n00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.002\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And we might want to go way\n\n207\n00:10:17.002 --> 00:10:20.715\nlonger then four weeks,\nwell you can, I could adjust this.\n\n208\n00:10:20.715 --> 00:10:23.285\nBut the problem here is,\nI might be worried about disk space.\n\n209\n00:10:23.285 --> 00:10:27.150\nThat as those logs grow, logs are pretty\nsmall, but when you fill up walls of text,\n\n210\n00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:28.377\neventually they do grow.\n\n211\n00:10:28.377 --> 00:10:32.964\nAnd on my servers, I might have the\nsmallest amount of storage possible to be\n\n212\n00:10:32.964 --> 00:10:34.872\nable to keep costs down.\n\n213\n00:10:34.872 --> 00:10:38.142\nIn that scenario, we need to make\nsure we can keep logs longer, or\n\n214\n00:10:38.142 --> 00:10:39.702\nwe need another technology.\n\n215\n00:10:39.702 --> 00:10:42.590\nThe other thing is, what if a hacker\nbreaks into this, and flushes the logs?\n\n216\n00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:45.902\nWell, now I've lost them, it doesn't\nmatter how long I was retaining them.\n\n217\n00:10:45.902 --> 00:10:48.418\nIf they're all right there on the server,\nand a hacker breaks into this server,\n\n218\n00:10:48.418 --> 00:10:49.690\nI've lost the logs.\n\n219\n00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:54.450\nSo another solution,\nis to use something called rsyslog,\n\n220\n00:10:54.450 --> 00:11:00.390\nrsyslog is well, just like syslog,\nexcept remote system log.\n\n221\n00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:04.660\nAnd what it says is instead of keeping\nthe logs right here on this server,\n\n222\n00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.100\nwe're gonna take them and\nship them to another server somewhere.\n\n223\n00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.510\nYou can set up a centralized\nsyslog server, and\n\n224\n00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.950\nnow you might have a 1,000\nservers on your network.\n\n225\n00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:17.650\nAnd they're all sending their\nlogs to this one remote location,\n\n226\n00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.180\nthere's two benefits to that.\n\n227\n00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:23.080\nBenefit number one,\nis you have one place to look for logs.\n\n228\n00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.715\nWhen there's an advanced persistent\nthreat, and they request the logs for\n\n229\n00:11:26.715 --> 00:11:28.774\nsix months, you can go to this one server.\n\n230\n00:11:28.774 --> 00:11:31.309\nYou can pull all the logs for\nsix months, get that data, and\n\n231\n00:11:31.309 --> 00:11:33.915\nhand it over to the forensics guys,\nand now they've got it.\n\n232\n00:11:33.915 --> 00:11:34.945\nYou went one place.\n\n233\n00:11:34.945 --> 00:11:38.228\nThe other thing is,\nif a hacker breaks into a to a server and\n\n234\n00:11:38.228 --> 00:11:42.386\npurges the logs, who cares,\nyou've already got a copy somewhere else.\n\n235\n00:11:42.386 --> 00:11:45.222\nYou've got that copy stored somewhere\nelse, the server loses its logs,\n\n236\n00:11:45.222 --> 00:11:46.622\nyou've already got them.\n\n237\n00:11:46.622 --> 00:11:49.618\nSo, two big protections there,\nrsyslog is really handy for that.\n\n238\n00:11:49.618 --> 00:11:53.236\nAnd so, if we want to configure that, that\none is a little bit harder to configure,\n\n239\n00:11:53.236 --> 00:11:55.221\nbut It's right here inside of this, /etc.\n\n240\n00:11:55.221 --> 00:11:59.148\nYou're going to look for\na file called rsyslog, and\n\n241\n00:11:59.148 --> 00:12:05.280\nwe'll find it right here in the Rs,\nrsyslog.conf, that file right there.\n\n242\n00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.251\nSo I'm gonna edit that one, and when\nwe're in that file, you'll see a lot of\n\n243\n00:12:10.251 --> 00:12:15.148\ninformation in here, that pertains to\nlike what ports it's going to use and\n\n244\n00:12:15.148 --> 00:12:18.120\nthe transport protocol and all of that.\n\n245\n00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.560\nBut at the end of the day,\nif I really wanna make use of this,\n\n246\n00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.240\nthere's just a couple of\nthings that we need to adjust.\n\n247\n00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.365\nRight here at the very beginning, there's\nthis provide UDP syslog reception, and\n\n248\n00:12:27.365 --> 00:12:29.790\nprovide TCP syslog reception.\n\n249\n00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:33.310\nI need to pick which\none we're going to use.\n\n250\n00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:37.610\nMost syslog servers use UDP,\nwhich is the user datagram protocol.\n\n251\n00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:41.450\nThe problem with UDP is that\nit's a best effort protocol.\n\n252\n00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:45.890\nSo when you generate a log message, you'll\nthrow it at this rsyslog server, and\n\n253\n00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.610\nif it makes it great,\nif it doesn't you skip over it.\n\n254\n00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:52.680\nAnd so with UDP, you might actually\nskip some messages and not realize it,\n\n255\n00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.890\nif the network wasn't stable at the time.\n\n256\n00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.120\nMost of us have a pretty stable\nnetwork and that's not a problem, but\n\n257\n00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.300\nif you're worried about that\nyou'll wanna use TCP instead.\n\n258\n00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:04.560\nIf a frame or a packet doesn't\nmake it to the other side,\n\n259\n00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.980\nit can request a retransmit, and\nyou'll retransmit it and get it over.\n\n260\n00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.470\nSo you need to make that decision, and\n\n261\n00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:13.070\nall you have to do is un-comment the lines\nhere for which one you want to use.\n\n262\n00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.920\nSo if I'm gonna use UDP,\ncuz my network is stable, shoot,\n\n263\n00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.620\nI forgot to elevate my privileges\nwhen I edited the file.\n\n264\n00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.756\nSo it's telling me it's read only,\nbut that's fine.\n\n265\n00:13:21.756 --> 00:13:25.070\nLet me just get out of this and\ngo back into it so\n\n266\n00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:28.219\nit doesn't get too mad at me, there we go.\n\n267\n00:13:28.219 --> 00:13:31.169\nAnd so I can come in here and I can just\ntake these and if I want to use UPD,\n\n268\n00:13:31.169 --> 00:13:33.970\nI can just get rid of the little\nhash marks before it.\n\n269\n00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.950\nAnd then there we go,\nnow I'm configured to use GDP.\n\n270\n00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.440\nSo that's one thing that I'm\ngonna need to configure.\n\n271\n00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.410\nThen, the other thing I need to do,\n\n272\n00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:45.040\nis I need to tell it where I\nwant to send the messages.\n\n273\n00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.110\nAnd as far as sending the messages out,\nyou put a little entry in here that tells\n\n274\n00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:52.350\nit where to go, and if I scroll down\nwe can see if there's messages already.\n\n275\n00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.903\nSee how there's things\nin here like mail.*.\n\n276\n00:13:54.903 --> 00:13:59.305\nSo any log that's generated that\npertains to the mail service,\n\n277\n00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:04.710\nis being sent to /vars/log.maillog,\nso that's where that is being sent.\n\n278\n00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:08.830\nSo as I continue to look down, these\nare all my different log messages and\n\n279\n00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.130\ndifferent places to forward them to.\n\n280\n00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:17.030\nAnd down here at the very end, I can add\nan entry to forward to a remote host,\n\n281\n00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:22.910\nand see how they're showing in the example\nthere, *.* ,that means every log.\n\n282\n00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.613\nYou can pick and choose, maybe I\njust want logs from the web server.\n\n283\n00:14:25.613 --> 00:14:28.553\nYou can do that, or just some certain\nseverity levels, you can do that.\n\n284\n00:14:28.553 --> 00:14:32.808\nBut what I want is to get everything, I\nwanna take every log message generated on\n\n285\n00:14:32.808 --> 00:14:35.950\nthis server, and\nI'm gonna send it to a remote host.\n\n286\n00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:41.000\nAnd so, you just do a double add sign\nfollowed by the IP address of that server.\n\n287\n00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.574\nSo maybe I've got a server at 172.16.0.99,\nthat's where I'm going to send it to.\n\n288\n00:14:46.574 --> 00:14:50.066\nAnd then I need to tell it the port\nnumber, 541 is the default port number,\n\n289\n00:14:50.066 --> 00:14:53.480\nyou still have to type it in though,\neven if you're using the default.\n\n290\n00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.100\nIf I change the port number up above,\nI can specify it here.\n\n291\n00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:00.620\nBut now, every time a log message\nis generated here on this server,\n\n292\n00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.110\nit's gonna send a copy of it to this IP.\n\n293\n00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:08.260\nAnd I would go to that server,\nyou know whoever is gonna be hosting this.\n\n294\n00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.860\nAnd on them we would need to configure,\n\n295\n00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.595\nfor them to be able to\nreceive these messages.\n\n296\n00:15:11.595 --> 00:15:13.390\nSo now, we've got it centrally aggregated.\n\n297\n00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:15.850\nSo if you're managing a large server farm,\n\n298\n00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:18.370\nyou should already have\na centralized sys log server.\n\n299\n00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.557\nWe're just forwarding to it, and\nthat's really what rsys log is all about,\n\n300\n00:15:21.557 --> 00:15:23.434\ngetting that information moved right over.\n\n301\n00:15:23.434 --> 00:15:27.784\nAnd all I have to do is restart the log\nservice and that'll take effect.\n\n302\n00:15:27.784 --> 00:15:31.250\nSo if I get out of this file and\n\n303\n00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:37.031\nthen just do a quick\nsystemctl enable rsyslog,\n\n304\n00:15:37.031 --> 00:15:40.580\nand then start rsyslog.\n\n305\n00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.329\nOkay now I said restart,\nwhich I shouldn't have said that,\n\n306\n00:15:44.329 --> 00:15:48.830\nbecause you're running syslog already and\nsyslog is logging locally.\n\n307\n00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:52.848\nI was turning on rsyslog which I wasn't\nrunning yet, so I just needed to start it.\n\n308\n00:15:52.848 --> 00:15:55.924\nIf I was already running syslog, then yes,\nI would have needed to restart it.\n\n309\n00:15:55.924 --> 00:15:56.951\nIt's the same basic command.\n\n310\n00:15:56.951 --> 00:16:01.707\nJust sudo systemctl restart rsyslog,\nand that'll restart it.\n\n311\n00:16:01.707 --> 00:16:06.267\nBut do note that syslog and\nrsyslog are two different services,\n\n312\n00:16:06.267 --> 00:16:10.500\nright, you can run just\nsyslog without rsyslog.\n\n313\n00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.834\nBut you actually can't\nrsyslog without just syslog.\n\n314\n00:16:13.834 --> 00:16:15.500\nBecause syslog is just\ndoing the local logging,\n\n315\n00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.260\nand if you don't have local logging, then\nrsyslog doesn't have anything to send.\n\n316\n00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.040\nSo you usually use the two together,\nand that's exactly what I'm doing here.\n\n317\n00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.870\nSyslog was already turned on by default,\nI've added rsyslog onto it, and\n\n318\n00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.548\nnow I've got a great solution.\n\n319\n00:16:27.548 --> 00:16:30.967\nBecause [COUGH] even if I'm\nrotating my logs to just four days,\n\n320\n00:16:30.967 --> 00:16:34.280\nI'm keeping only four\ndays with the logs here.\n\n321\n00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.310\nWhen I use rsyslog, and\n\n322\n00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:39.140\nI send it to another server, my log rotate\ndoesn't apply to that other server.\n\n323\n00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.670\nIt can hold them as long as they want.\n\n324\n00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.114\nSo going back to Zach's question,\nwe can hold them forever,\n\n325\n00:16:43.114 --> 00:16:45.093\nit really just comes down\nthe storage over there.\n\n326\n00:16:45.093 --> 00:16:48.207\nBut that's basically rsyslog,\nand once we get that in place,\n\n327\n00:16:48.207 --> 00:16:50.281\nnow syslog is working the way that I want.\n\n328\n00:16:50.281 --> 00:16:53.154\nAnd I've got my local logging kind of\nconfigured the way that I need it.\n\n329\n00:16:53.154 --> 00:16:54.428\n&gt;&gt; But wait, there's more questions.\n\n330\n00:16:54.428 --> 00:16:57.504\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, all the logs we've talked about,\n\n331\n00:16:57.504 --> 00:17:00.971\nall the different types we've already\ntalked about, are they standard for\n\n332\n00:17:00.971 --> 00:17:02.440\nevery system?\n\n333\n00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.517\n&gt;&gt; For the most part, yes.\n\n334\n00:17:03.517 --> 00:17:06.590\nRight, syslog has been around a long,\nlong time, right?\n\n335\n00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:10.180\nIt was developed in the late 1970s,\nthe early versions of Unix.\n\n336\n00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.900\nThis is what they use for logging, and\nit stuck around over 30 years, right?\n\n337\n00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:18.040\nAnd it serves its job,\nalmost 40 years, to do what it does,\n\n338\n00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.760\nit does a great job at it, right?\n\n339\n00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.916\nBut there are some limitations,\nwhich we've largely been talking about,\n\n340\n00:17:22.916 --> 00:17:24.206\nlike the ability to export it.\n\n341\n00:17:24.206 --> 00:17:26.762\nAnd the fact that the logs\nare all stored as a text file, so\n\n342\n00:17:26.762 --> 00:17:30.240\nthey're susceptible to being modified,\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n343\n00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.470\nSyslog has its weak points, but by and\n\n344\n00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:37.630\nlarge, every Linux distribution\nthat I've ever touched has syslog.\n\n345\n00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:39.540\nIt might be modified, for example,\n\n346\n00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.990\nwhere it just writes to memory\ninstead of writing to disk.\n\n347\n00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.800\nBut, at the end of the day,\nthey've all got syslog.\n\n348\n00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.986\nAnd so I can say that right now, right?\n\n349\n00:17:46.986 --> 00:17:51.200\nSo if you're watching this right now: yes,\nyou can count on syslog being there.\n\n350\n00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.260\nBut it's not gonna be like that for\nmuch longer, right?\n\n351\n00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.014\nIn fact, the replacement for\nsyslog is already out there and\n\n352\n00:17:57.014 --> 00:17:58.639\nalready deployed on most systems.\n\n353\n00:17:58.639 --> 00:18:03.256\nSo on most systems you're actually\nrunning two different logging systems,\n\n354\n00:18:03.256 --> 00:18:06.400\nsyslog, and\na new one called journald, right?\n\n355\n00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.880\nJournald, or the journaling daemon,\nis part of systemd.\n\n356\n00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.628\nIt is the native logging system that's\npart of systemd, and it's impressive,\n\n357\n00:18:13.628 --> 00:18:14.572\nit's really good.\n\n358\n00:18:14.572 --> 00:18:17.576\nJournald fixes a lot of\nthe problems with syslog,\n\n359\n00:18:17.576 --> 00:18:22.180\nthings like instead of using a text file,\nit uses binary files, right?\n\n360\n00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.848\nBinary files that can't be modified,\nso now if an attacker gets in,\n\n361\n00:18:24.848 --> 00:18:28.180\nthey can destroy the log, but they can't\nmodify it, they can't change it, right?\n\n362\n00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.580\nSo it's much more protected, and\nit gives you much better information.\n\n363\n00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.690\nYou get a lot more detailed data inside\nof it than you do out of syslog,\n\n364\n00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:37.060\nso journald is really good.\n\n365\n00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.860\nBut that's a pretty big change,\nto have this\n\n366\n00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.880\ncore logging system that's been around for\nforever and all of a sudden change it.\n\n367\n00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.650\nSo most distros have been\npretty slow to accept that.\n\n368\n00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:51.310\nUbuntu, Red Hat, Fedora,\nthey all run journald, right now.\n\n369\n00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:55.490\nAnd it should already be installed,\nand turned on by default, right?\n\n370\n00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.840\nBut, it's not the primary logging system,\n\n371\n00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.130\nsyslog is still the primary\nlogging system.\n\n372\n00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:02.580\nOn my computer, and\n\n373\n00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.342\non this server that we've spun up here\nin this show, it is using syslog.\n\n374\n00:19:06.342 --> 00:19:08.230\nBut journald is there, right?\n\n375\n00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:12.300\nLet me show you, so\nI was showing you /var/log,\n\n376\n00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:16.730\nand inside of there,\nthis messages folder, okay?\n\n377\n00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:21.012\nSo that's the folder where, or sorry,\nfile [LAUGH] where syslog is writing to.\n\n378\n00:19:21.012 --> 00:19:27.580\nJournald is turned on, is gathering logs,\nbut it's only writing them to memory.\n\n379\n00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.460\nOkay, so I don't see a journald\nfolder in here or a file,\n\n380\n00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.580\nit will actually be a folder\nif it gets created.\n\n381\n00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:37.050\nBut I don't see that, and\nthat's because journald is running, but\n\n382\n00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.120\nits not persistent,\nit's just logging to memory.\n\n383\n00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.140\nSo every time you reboot what\nhappens to your journald logs?\n\n384\n00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.330\nThey go away right?\n\n385\n00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:48.463\nBut they are there, and\nyou can see them with journalctl, okay?\n\n386\n00:19:48.463 --> 00:19:52.770\nLet me sudo that,\njournalctl will bring up that log.\n\n387\n00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:57.070\nAnd I can just run it, and\nyou can scroll through and see it.\n\n388\n00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:00.790\nAnd for the most part,\nit looks just like the syslog data.\n\n389\n00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:04.150\nExcept for all these extra stuff\nhere at the beginning, right?\n\n390\n00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:06.220\nInstead of the little timestamp\nthat we normally see here,\n\n391\n00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.230\nI'm seeing a longer more\ndetailed timestamp.\n\n392\n00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:13.590\nAnd the localhost and domain name\nof that system, or host name and\n\n393\n00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.950\ndomain name of the system.\n\n394\n00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:18.160\nThat when syslog was originally written,\nrsyslog didn't exist,\n\n395\n00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.477\ndo they didn't nest this data in here.\n\n396\n00:20:19.477 --> 00:20:23.310\nBut with journald, they know that we\ncan be shipping logs different places.\n\n397\n00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:26.600\nSo they nest in the name of the system\nthat generated the log message\n\n398\n00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.680\nto help you with filtering\nthat identification.\n\n399\n00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.365\nBut otherwise, everything that's\nbeing sent to syslog is being\n\n400\n00:20:32.365 --> 00:20:35.205\nsent to journald as well,\nso I'm getting duplicates.\n\n401\n00:20:35.205 --> 00:20:39.905\nBut then journald has additional\ndata that syslog doesn't.\n\n402\n00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:43.245\nSo more detailed information about some\nof the modern services that are hooked\n\n403\n00:20:43.245 --> 00:20:44.875\ninto systemd.\n\n404\n00:20:44.875 --> 00:20:49.775\nNow every developer out there right\nnow is still supporting syslog.\n\n405\n00:20:49.775 --> 00:20:53.891\nOver time though, you're gonna start\nseeing services where they say nope,\n\n406\n00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:55.995\nall our log messages go to systemd now.\n\n407\n00:20:55.995 --> 00:20:58.650\nThey go to journald, and not to syslog.\n\n408\n00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.560\nAnd what's more than likely gonna happen\nis the systems are just cut right\n\n409\n00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.100\nover at that point.\n\n410\n00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.562\nAnd say we're just gonna eliminate\nsyslog and get it out of there.\n\n411\n00:21:04.562 --> 00:21:06.790\nBut, it'll be a slow process,\nit'll take a couple of years, but\n\n412\n00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.214\nthat's what's gonna happen.\n\n413\n00:21:08.214 --> 00:21:12.210\nNow, journalctl,\nbecause its data is in a binary format,\n\n414\n00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.460\nI can't just cat its files or\nuse less or whatever.\n\n415\n00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.660\nI've gotta do things through\nthe journalctl command, and\n\n416\n00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.710\nthat's what's making sure I have\npermissions to access the logs,\n\n417\n00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.380\nthat I'm allowed to get in there and\ndo it.\n\n418\n00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.790\nThere's a group created by\ndefault in Red Hat called adm,\n\n419\n00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:29.010\nand if you're in the adm group you\nhave permission to use journalctl.\n\n420\n00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.460\nOtherwise I wouldn't be\nable to run that command.\n\n421\n00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:36.540\nYou can do things like journalctl -f,\nwhich follows the file, and\n\n422\n00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:40.440\nnow it's showing me the ten most\nrecent lines, and it's following it.\n\n423\n00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.400\nSo as I start to do things,\nthat I adjust the system or\n\n424\n00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.230\nwhatever, it'll update here on the screen.\n\n425\n00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:50.910\nSo for example, if I were to fire\nopen another terminal and try and\n\n426\n00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:55.880\nssh into the system, maybe I try and log\nin as root, right, which is not allowed.\n\n427\n00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.210\nAnd so I come in and I try and\n\n428\n00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:00.386\nlogin, and I fail,\nin the background see how it, whoops.\n\n429\n00:22:00.386 --> 00:22:05.280\n[LAUGH] See how it just updated to\nreflect that I'm not allowed to log in,\n\n430\n00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.390\ncuz the root user is blocked via ssh,\nright?\n\n431\n00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:09.270\nSo I see that and\n\n432\n00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:12.210\nI can watch it, just like I could\nwatch a regular log file, right?\n\n433\n00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:16.218\nI might do something like,\ntail /var/log/messages,\n\n434\n00:22:16.218 --> 00:22:18.109\nactually let me sudo that.\n\n435\n00:22:18.109 --> 00:22:21.000\nAnd so\nnow I'm watching the end of that file.\n\n436\n00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.260\nOops, sorry, I need tail -f to follow,\nthere we go.\n\n437\n00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.380\nAnd now I'm watching the end of it, right?\n\n438\n00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:30.210\nBut notice, I didn't get any messages\nhere about that failed login attempt.\n\n439\n00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:34.340\nRight, journald did, syslog didn't, right?\n\n440\n00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.990\nSyslog is gathering data like it always\nhas, but it's just not as detailed\n\n441\n00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:41.070\nof information, so\njournald is definitely the better choice.\n\n442\n00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.320\nThe main problem you're gonna\nbump into with journald though,\n\n443\n00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.460\nis that it's not persistent,\nthat if I reboot, I lose all the logs.\n\n444\n00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.050\nThe logs inside of journald\nonly go back to boot time.\n\n445\n00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:53.700\nIf you wanna make the logs persistent,\nyou're gonna need to configure that right?\n\n446\n00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:59.510\nAnd I'm not sure of all the politics\nbehind it, but basically each distro,\n\n447\n00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:02.520\nDebian, Red Hat, they've all kind\nof reached the same conclusion,\n\n448\n00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.090\nthat they don't want people\nto have two sets of logs.\n\n449\n00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:08.130\nAnd so if they have to pick one set,\nthey're picking syslog right now.\n\n450\n00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:10.480\nAnd so that's why persistence\nis turned off by default.\n\n451\n00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.730\nIt's super easy to turn it on though, but\n\n452\n00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.030\ndo be aware that you'll be\nmanaging two sets of logs.\n\n453\n00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:17.810\nNow I like to act under\nthe assumption that people are smart,\n\n454\n00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:19.100\nnot that people are dumb.\n\n455\n00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.090\nAnd so if you've got two sets of logs,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n456\n00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.635\nI need to watch my storage and maintain\nand do log rotation and purge out logs and\n\n457\n00:23:25.635 --> 00:23:28.876\nthings so I don't run a hard drive\nspace as we generate those messages.\n\n458\n00:23:28.876 --> 00:23:33.150\nSo I'm gonna turn on persistence here,\nand it's actually really easy to do.\n\n459\n00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.940\nWe need to edit the configuration file for\njournald, and\n\n460\n00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:41.385\nit is inside of\n/etc/systemd/journald.conf, right?\n\n461\n00:23:42.475 --> 00:23:44.354\nThat's the configuration file for\njournald.\n\n462\n00:23:44.354 --> 00:23:48.366\nAnd if you crack that open and look in\nhere, notice this little entry right here,\n\n463\n00:23:48.366 --> 00:23:51.325\nit's commented out, but\nit says Storage=auto, right?\n\n464\n00:23:51.325 --> 00:23:54.198\nThat means that it's going to\nautomatically figure out what\n\n465\n00:23:54.198 --> 00:23:54.991\nstorage to use.\n\n466\n00:23:54.991 --> 00:23:58.876\nNow, if I leave it that way, which is\nthe default, it's just gonna use memory,\n\n467\n00:23:58.876 --> 00:24:00.608\nit's not gonna use storage at all.\n\n468\n00:24:00.608 --> 00:24:04.276\nUnless, it finds a journal folder, right?\n\n469\n00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:07.106\nIf there was a folder in /var/log/journal,\n\n470\n00:24:07.106 --> 00:24:11.576\nif that folder existed then it would\nuse it and it would become persistent.\n\n471\n00:24:11.576 --> 00:24:17.245\nSo you'll find a lot of instructions out\nthere on the Internet, where people say,\n\n472\n00:24:17.245 --> 00:24:22.307\nyeah, if you wanna be persistent\njust do a sudu mkdir/va/log/journal.\n\n473\n00:24:22.307 --> 00:24:25.306\nAnd then when you restart the journal\nD service, it'll start logging.\n\n474\n00:24:25.306 --> 00:24:29.150\nAnd that's true, that does work except\nyou have the potential of messing\n\n475\n00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:30.520\nup permissions, right?\n\n476\n00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.241\nThe permissions on that\nfolder can be set wrong.\n\n477\n00:24:32.241 --> 00:24:36.784\nSo what I recommend is not doing it\nthat way but instead coming in here and\n\n478\n00:24:36.784 --> 00:24:41.876\nin this configuration file you can just\nsay storage=persistent, all right?\n\n479\n00:24:41.876 --> 00:24:47.170\nSo I'm tell it I want it to\nsave the logs to disk, okay?\n\n480\n00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:51.952\nNow, by telling it that, it knows I want\nto save to disk and if I look inside\n\n481\n00:24:51.952 --> 00:24:56.830\nof /bar/log, I do not have a journal\nfolder, I haven't made it, okay?\n\n482\n00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:02.611\nBut, if I do a systemctl, restart,\n\n483\n00:25:02.611 --> 00:25:07.279\nsystemd-jounald, right?\n\n484\n00:25:07.279 --> 00:25:09.229\nI can restart that service.\n\n485\n00:25:09.229 --> 00:25:12.462\nAnd I'm sudo-ing this, I'm actually in\na root session right now anyways, so\n\n486\n00:25:12.462 --> 00:25:13.415\nit wouldn't matter.\n\n487\n00:25:13.415 --> 00:25:15.239\nBut there we go, so I'm gonna restart it.\n\n488\n00:25:15.239 --> 00:25:17.187\nWhen I restart it,\nit's gonna see the configuration file and\n\n489\n00:25:17.187 --> 00:25:18.961\nit's gonna say,\nI'm supposed to be persistent.\n\n490\n00:25:18.961 --> 00:25:20.921\nAnd it's gonna see the folder as missing,\nand\n\n491\n00:25:20.921 --> 00:25:22.638\nit's gonna put the folder there for me.\n\n492\n00:25:22.638 --> 00:25:25.770\nAnd it'll have the right permissions and\nit'll be configured the right way.\n\n493\n00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:27.218\nSo this is the easiest\nway to avoid mistakes.\n\n494\n00:25:27.218 --> 00:25:28.761\nThis is the way I recommend you do it.\n\n495\n00:25:28.761 --> 00:25:33.120\nAnd by doing that,\nnow I've got a folder called journal.\n\n496\n00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.816\nAnd that's where the data's being written.\n\n497\n00:25:34.816 --> 00:25:37.555\nAnd if I reboot,\nI don't lose all my journald anymore,\n\n498\n00:25:37.555 --> 00:25:38.968\nnow it's being preserved.\n\n499\n00:25:38.968 --> 00:25:41.588\nIf I go into that folder,\nwhich is why I'm logged in as root.\n\n500\n00:25:41.588 --> 00:25:43.619\nNormally I wouldn't even be\nable to go into this folder.\n\n501\n00:25:43.619 --> 00:25:46.907\nBut if I go in there I\ncan see a binary file.\n\n502\n00:25:46.907 --> 00:25:51.217\nAnd if I try and look at that file, right?\n\n503\n00:25:51.217 --> 00:25:54.392\nIt's gonna tell me oops,\nsorry, that it is a directory,\n\n504\n00:25:54.392 --> 00:25:56.529\nthat's what it's gonna tell me first.\n\n505\n00:25:56.529 --> 00:25:58.756\nAnd then when I get in there,\nthere's the file.\n\n506\n00:25:58.756 --> 00:26:03.026\nAnd if I try and\npull that it's a binary file.\n\n507\n00:26:03.026 --> 00:26:05.031\nSo I just see junk, right?\n\n508\n00:26:05.031 --> 00:26:09.540\nI can't actually read that file but\nthere is, system.journal.\n\n509\n00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:12.595\nThat's it, log in to the disk,\nand put in that data in there and\n\n510\n00:26:12.595 --> 00:26:14.048\nstoring in a secured format.\n\n511\n00:26:14.048 --> 00:26:16.751\nIt's actually a binary\nthat's encrypted as well.\n\n512\n00:26:16.751 --> 00:26:19.830\nSo I can't mess with it, right?\n\n513\n00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:23.564\nSo we're safe, the data is stored there,\nI can go in and\n\n514\n00:26:23.564 --> 00:26:27.065\npull data out of journal ctl\ntill the cows come home.\n\n515\n00:26:27.065 --> 00:26:27.876\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n516\n00:26:27.876 --> 00:26:29.157\nI can troubleshoot find my information.\n\n517\n00:26:29.157 --> 00:26:32.850\nSo if you wanna start using journal\nctl today, it's a good idea.\n\n518\n00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:35.986\nYou know journald and\njournal ctl just make it persistent and\n\n519\n00:26:35.986 --> 00:26:38.087\nthat could be your go to logging source.\n\n520\n00:26:38.087 --> 00:26:44.500\nAnd then in time sys log will go away,\nbut not every system has journald.\n\n521\n00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.879\nThere are still some systems that\nare clinging on to the old sys v inits or\n\n522\n00:26:47.879 --> 00:26:50.482\nupstart inits and\nthose are gonna be issuing sys logs.\n\n523\n00:26:50.482 --> 00:26:53.917\nSo if you learn sys log,\nyou'll have that everywhere, right?\n\n524\n00:26:53.917 --> 00:26:58.878\nIf you learn journald, you'll have it most\nplaces and you're prepared for tomorrow.\n\n525\n00:26:58.878 --> 00:27:00.845\nThe best solution is\nreally to learn both and\n\n526\n00:27:00.845 --> 00:27:03.779\nmake sure you've got them configured and\nset up the way you want.\n\n527\n00:27:03.779 --> 00:27:05.337\nThat persistence is really important.\n\n528\n00:27:05.337 --> 00:27:08.444\nIf you forget to configure it and\nthen you have a problem,\n\n529\n00:27:08.444 --> 00:27:10.988\nyou can't look back\nbeyond your last reboot.\n\n530\n00:27:10.988 --> 00:27:13.063\nAnd it's too late at that point,\nthose logs are gone.\n\n531\n00:27:13.063 --> 00:27:16.282\nWe need to make sure we turn\nthis on ahead of time so\n\n532\n00:27:16.282 --> 00:27:19.828\nwe've got those log messages there and\nready for us.\n\n533\n00:27:19.828 --> 00:27:21.242\nAll right, let me just, before we wrap up,\n\n534\n00:27:21.242 --> 00:27:22.941\nI'm getting the signal\nwe're running out of time.\n\n535\n00:27:22.941 --> 00:27:24.978\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But just a couple of journal ctl\n\n536\n00:27:24.978 --> 00:27:26.850\ncommands that are handy for us.\n\n537\n00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:28.195\nI showed you journalctl,\n\n538\n00:27:28.195 --> 00:27:31.324\nlet me get out of this folder\ncuz it's like really long path.\n\n539\n00:27:31.324 --> 00:27:33.742\nI showed you journalctl -f, which says,\n\n540\n00:27:33.742 --> 00:27:36.508\nshow me the last ten lines and\nfollow it, right?\n\n541\n00:27:36.508 --> 00:27:38.137\nSo that's one way we can do it.\n\n542\n00:27:38.137 --> 00:27:41.467\nBut you can also do journalctl -n and\n\n543\n00:27:41.467 --> 00:27:45.990\nyou can tell it to show me\na certain number of line.\n\n544\n00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:48.832\nSo I can say like show\nme the first ten lines.\n\n545\n00:27:48.832 --> 00:27:52.532\nAnd so here I'm getting lines 1\nthrough 11 or whatever, or actually,\n\n546\n00:27:52.532 --> 00:27:55.823\nthis is our last ten lines,\nI'm sorry, I need to get that right.\n\n547\n00:27:55.823 --> 00:27:58.395\nSo you can kinda modify what\nit is that you're outputting.\n\n548\n00:27:58.395 --> 00:28:00.836\nIf you just run it by yourself,\nyou see the whole thing.\n\n549\n00:28:00.836 --> 00:28:04.031\nAnd that beyond CVS what I normally\ndo cuz I'll pipe that in the grep and\n\n550\n00:28:04.031 --> 00:28:05.668\nthen I look for something, right?\n\n551\n00:28:05.668 --> 00:28:08.753\nMaybe I'm troubleshooting HTPD and\nso I'll grep for that.\n\n552\n00:28:08.753 --> 00:28:11.183\nAnd then I get those entries back and\nI can look at them and\n\n553\n00:28:11.183 --> 00:28:13.379\nI can see that information and\nget it out of there.\n\n554\n00:28:13.379 --> 00:28:16.956\nSo you can certainly pipe and then use\nthe utilities that you're used to.\n\n555\n00:28:16.956 --> 00:28:20.109\nAt that point, it's really no different\nthan how you work with syslog.\n\n556\n00:28:20.109 --> 00:28:22.352\nHere, it's just a different\ncommand that we're using.\n\n557\n00:28:22.352 --> 00:28:25.465\nSome of the other things you can\ndo is you can filter by priority.\n\n558\n00:28:25.465 --> 00:28:27.360\nLike maybe I just wanna see errors.\n\n559\n00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.104\nWell, I used to have\nthis problem in syslog,\n\n560\n00:28:30.104 --> 00:28:34.295\nwhere I would say like cat\n/var/log/messages and I would pipe that\n\n561\n00:28:34.295 --> 00:28:38.525\ninto grep and I would do a case\ninsensitive search for the word error.\n\n562\n00:28:38.525 --> 00:28:41.756\nCuz maybe the e is capitalized,\nmaybe the whole word is capitalized,\n\n563\n00:28:41.756 --> 00:28:44.848\nI don't know, and I could go in and\nI could look for those, right?\n\n564\n00:28:44.848 --> 00:28:49.027\nOr sometimes maybe just said err,\nthere's some more.\n\n565\n00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:51.211\nI would have missed that just looking for\nthe word error, right?\n\n566\n00:28:51.211 --> 00:28:54.131\nWell actually, these are interrupts,\nso that doesn't even really count.\n\n567\n00:28:54.131 --> 00:28:56.700\nSo that's a challenge\nthat we had with syslog.\n\n568\n00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:02.596\nBut with journald,\nwe can actually say, journalctl -p.\n\n569\n00:29:02.596 --> 00:29:05.196\nAnd I can look for\nthe priorities, and I can say,\n\n570\n00:29:05.196 --> 00:29:08.071\nshow me everything that has\nan err priority, right?\n\n571\n00:29:08.071 --> 00:29:11.161\nThat's an error, I'm not getting all\nthose interrupts, they're there,\n\n572\n00:29:11.161 --> 00:29:12.119\nI'm not getting them.\n\n573\n00:29:12.119 --> 00:29:15.645\nI'm just seeing the ones that have\nactually been flagged as some\n\n574\n00:29:15.645 --> 00:29:16.769\nkind of error here.\n\n575\n00:29:16.769 --> 00:29:19.391\nAnd I can look at what that is and\ntry and figure out what they are.\n\n576\n00:29:19.391 --> 00:29:23.237\nLooks like I've got some kind of storage\nissue on which is odd on a virtual machine\n\n577\n00:29:23.237 --> 00:29:24.210\nbut anyhow I see it.\n\n578\n00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:30.820\nSo that's a technique and you can also\nfilter by date and time if you want to,\n\n579\n00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:36.300\nso I could say journalctl --since= and\nspecify a date.\n\n580\n00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.447\nSo maybe I wanna see all\nthe log entries for January.\n\n581\n00:29:39.447 --> 00:29:44.394\nSo I could say since 2017-01-01,\n\n582\n00:29:44.394 --> 00:29:47.785\n00:00:00 like that.\n\n583\n00:29:47.785 --> 00:29:50.529\nSo show me everything since that date, and\n\n584\n00:29:50.529 --> 00:29:54.046\nI could say --until,\nwe're gonna go even further.\n\n585\n00:29:54.046 --> 00:30:01.272\nAnd in here I can say,\nuntil = '2017-02-01'\n\n586\n00:30:01.272 --> 00:30:05.770\n00:00:00, all right?\n\n587\n00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:09.248\nAnd by doing that I'm saying show me\neverything that occurred between January\n\n588\n00:30:09.248 --> 00:30:10.415\n1st and January 31st.\n\n589\n00:30:10.415 --> 00:30:13.138\nOr if you're like me and you can't\nremember if it has 31 days, right?\n\n590\n00:30:13.138 --> 00:30:15.418\nThen it's really all the way\nup until February 1st.\n\n591\n00:30:15.418 --> 00:30:19.922\nSo by doing that now I'll just get those\nlog messages which it looks like I don't\n\n592\n00:30:19.922 --> 00:30:23.974\nhave any, which makes sense cuz I just\nspun up this server two days ago.\n\n593\n00:30:23.974 --> 00:30:25.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] So anyhow we can filter that\n\n594\n00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:27.430\nway through journalctl very powerful.\n\n595\n00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:29.261\nIt is the way of the future,\nit's the way we wanna learn it.\n\n596\n00:30:29.261 --> 00:30:32.579\nAnd that's what you're gonna be\nusing now and in the future, but\n\n597\n00:30:32.579 --> 00:30:33.798\nsyslog is everywhere.\n\n598\n00:30:33.798 --> 00:30:37.509\nGoing back to Zach's original question\nof is it gonna be the same everywhere?\n\n599\n00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:40.196\nIf you want the same everywhere,\nsyslog is what you need to get used to.\n\n600\n00:30:40.196 --> 00:30:43.131\nAnd I do recommend that you learn both,\nat least of the time being.\n\n601\n00:30:43.131 --> 00:30:45.482\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic information, as always, Don.\n\n602\n00:30:45.482 --> 00:30:48.759\nAnd like he's saying,\nbe prepared for the future, so\n\n603\n00:30:48.759 --> 00:30:51.618\nconfiguring system logging,\nany last words?\n\n604\n00:30:51.618 --> 00:30:53.747\n&gt;&gt; The main thing,\nconfig your log rotation, right?\n\n605\n00:30:53.747 --> 00:30:56.748\nDon't assume the defaults are going to\nbe friendly for your security policy,\n\n606\n00:30:56.748 --> 00:30:57.842\ndefinitely check that out.\n\n607\n00:30:57.842 --> 00:31:00.830\nI encourage you to set up\na centralized logging server.\n\n608\n00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:03.610\nIf you don't have one already, it's\na great place to have a second server.\n\n609\n00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:05.929\nAnd you can even provide more\nthan one server if you want.\n\n610\n00:31:05.929 --> 00:31:09.053\nYou might have a remote logging server\nthat's right there in your headquarters\n\n611\n00:31:09.053 --> 00:31:10.788\nand another that's at disaster recovery.\n\n612\n00:31:10.788 --> 00:31:13.919\nSo now you've got two different\ncopies of those logs being sent out.\n\n613\n00:31:13.919 --> 00:31:15.720\nYou can do that, right?\n\n614\n00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.500\nAnd then after that,\nthese are just text files, right?\n\n615\n00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.590\nIn sys log they could be compressed,\nthey become very, very small.\n\n616\n00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:23.991\nSo I know a lot of people use\nscripts to automate that process,\n\n617\n00:31:23.991 --> 00:31:25.310\ncompressing logs down.\n\n618\n00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:27.100\nWith journal ctl,\nthey're encrypted binary, so\n\n619\n00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.109\nthey don't really compress all that well,\nso we don't have to worry about it there.\n\n620\n00:31:30.109 --> 00:31:32.970\nBut definitely pay attention to\nyour maintenance schedule on those,\n\n621\n00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.974\ndouble check it and probably the most\nimportant thing that I can tell you,\n\n622\n00:31:35.974 --> 00:31:37.398\nmonitor your logs, look at them.\n\n623\n00:31:37.398 --> 00:31:39.044\nA lot of people do log in,\nthey never look at them,\n\n624\n00:31:39.044 --> 00:31:41.021\nthere's not a whole lot of point\nhaving them at that point.\n\n625\n00:31:41.021 --> 00:31:44.121\nSo, make sure you look at your logs, they\ngot a lot of great information in there\n\n626\n00:31:44.121 --> 00:31:45.899\nand they can help you\nsolve a lot of problems.\n\n627\n00:31:45.899 --> 00:31:49.440\n&gt;&gt; Awesome advice,\nbecoming a Linux server administrator.\n\n628\n00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.760\nThere's a lot of video\ncontent in this series,\n\n629\n00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:55.472\nmake sure you watch every single video,\nyou're gonna be very glad you did.\n\n630\n00:31:55.472 --> 00:31:57.381\nAnd thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n631\n00:31:57.381 --> 00:32:00.916\nRemember, a good IT pro\nis always learning.\n\n632\n00:32:00.916 --> 00:32:01.528\nI'm Zach Memos.\n\n633\n00:32:01.528 --> 00:32:02.379\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n634\n00:32:02.379 --> 00:32:04.122\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you
