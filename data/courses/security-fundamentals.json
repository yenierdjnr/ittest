ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,960\nI'm your host, Don Pezet, and\nI've got our resident security expert,\n\n4\n00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,470\nMike Roderick, here with me.\n\n5\n00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,990\nAnd we're about to embark upon a journey,\na journey of IT security or\n\n6\n00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,690\ninformation security and\nall of the things that a regular,\n\n7\n00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,860\naverage, run-of-the-mill employee needs\nto be familiar with if you're going to\n\n8\n00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,520\nbe using computers and\nmore importantly using the Internet.\n\n9\n00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,600\nThere's a lot of pitfalls and things that\nwe need to watch out for out there, and\n\n10\n00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,590\nthe information security\numbrella is a big one.\n\n11\n00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,880\nIt covers a lot of different topics.\n\n12\n00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,040\nSo that's what we're gonna be tackling as\nwe go through this series, each episode,\n\n13\n00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,790\ngrabbing different areas of\nwhat we need to be aware of.\n\n14\n00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,270\nAnd boy, there's a lot we need to\nbe aware of, isn't there, Mike?\n\n15\n00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,620\n>> There really is, Don.\n\n16\n00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,830\nAnd before we dive into all\nthose different things,\n\n17\n00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,580\nI think one of the things we want\nto make sure we have is a good\n\n18\n00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,820\nfoundational knowledge\nabout information security.\n\n19\n00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,630\nWe talk about security and\nthe need for it, but what do we mean?\n\n20\n00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,650\nWhat do we mean by that\nfoundational security?\n\n21\n00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,590\nThere are several different\nmodels out there that we can use,\n\n22\n00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:17,400\nand one of the most common ones\nis known as the CIA triad.\n\n23\n00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,260\nNow when I talk about that,\n\n24\n00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,380\nI'm not referring to\nthe Central Intelligence Agency\n\n25\n00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,380\nthat we find here in the US or\nanything like that.\n\n26\n00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,530\nThe CIA triad is a very accepted\nsecurity model that allows us to\n\n27\n00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,490\nkind of test or verify that our\nsecurity methods and policies\n\n28\n00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,970\nthat we put in place in an organization\nare doing what they're supposed to do,\n\n29\n00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,530\nand they're indeed keeping\nour information safe.\n\n30\n00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,020\nThey call it the CIA triad.\n\n31\n00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,430\nIt's got three main points,\nhence the name triad.\n\n32\n00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,660\nAnd the C stands for confidentiality,\n\n33\n00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,470\nthe I is going to be integrity,\nand the A is for availability.\n\n34\n00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:59,800\nAll three of those are very key components\nwhen it comes to information security.\n\n35\n00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,470\n>> And it's important that we at least\nhave a basic grasp of what each of those\n\n36\n00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,560\nthree ideas are,\n\n37\n00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,080\nbecause information security more than\nlikely expands beyond what you think of.\n\n38\n00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,900\nWhen people think of information security,\nthey think of stuff we do on computers,\n\n39\n00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,120\nright, anti-virus, firewalls.\n\n40\n00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,250\nBut it expands even beyond that to things\nlike locked doors and insurance policies\n\n41\n00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,100\nand things you wouldn't even normally\nassociate with computers, but are equally\n\n42\n00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,810\nimportant to maintaining a functioning,\nsafe and secure IT environment.\n\n43\n00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,270\nSo Mike, let's break each one of these\ndown and give everybody kind of an idea of\n\n44\n00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,040\nwhat they mean, what they do,\nwhy they're important.\n\n45\n00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,446\nAnd let's start off with confidentiality.\n\n46\n00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,755\n>> All right, it's a good place to start.\n\n47\n00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:38,570\nIt's one of the more easy ones,\nI think, for people to understand.\n\n48\n00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,990\nThey might have dealt with\nthis in one way or the other.\n\n49\n00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:46,420\nConfidentiality, as you're probably aware,\njust means making sure that the data or\n\n50\n00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,950\nwhatever it is we're trying to\nprotect remains confidential.\n\n51\n00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,200\nIn other words,\nonly the authorized people or\n\n52\n00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:00,395\nentities have access to that information,\nwhether that's data or access to\n\n53\n00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:05,155\nthe server closet or something like that,\nkeeping that information confidential.\n\n54\n00:03:05,155 --> 00:03:08,435\n>> And that's pretty challenging\nbecause in the early days of computing,\n\n55\n00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:09,425\nnetworks were small.\n\n56\n00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:11,265\nYou only had a couple of computers.\n\n57\n00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:14,155\nThey were private inside\nindividual businesses, and\n\n58\n00:03:14,155 --> 00:03:17,095\nyou didn't have to worry about somebody\nintercepting your data as it moved between\n\n59\n00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:19,615\nmachines that were right\nthere in the same room.\n\n60\n00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:22,060\nAnd so as we grew and\nthe Internet developed,\n\n61\n00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,850\na lot of those technologies were not\nprepared to hide or secure your data.\n\n62\n00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,310\nAnd so\ntechnologies we use every day like email,\n\n63\n00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,630\nemail is sent across\nthe Internet in plain text.\n\n64\n00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,010\nAnybody could intercept that and\nread your email.\n\n65\n00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,430\nIt is not a secure\ncommunication mechanism.\n\n66\n00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,360\nSo we've had to take additional\nsteps to secure our data,\n\n67\n00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,210\nto protect it, and\nthat's what confidentiality is all about.\n\n68\n00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,680\nIf I send an email to Mike, I want to\nmake sure that only Mike can read that.\n\n69\n00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,160\nI don't want just anybody to be\nable to grab that and read it.\n\n70\n00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,350\nOr if it's my mortgage documents,\nmy banking, tax records,\n\n71\n00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,100\nwhatever, I want to make sure that\nI can keep that data private.\n\n72\n00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,200\nAnd that's what\nconfidentiality is all about.\n\n73\n00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,910\n>> Exactly.\nThere's several different things we can\n\n74\n00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,560\nuse to provide that confidentiality.\n\n75\n00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,060\nOne of the big ones is\ngoing to be encryption.\n\n76\n00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,590\nEncryption allows me to take something.\n\n77\n00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,540\nWe use these fancy terms.\n\n78\n00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,110\nWe take something called plain\ntext which is human readable and\n\n79\n00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,790\nconvert it into something\nwe call cipher text.\n\n80\n00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,460\nWhich means in order to read it I'm gonna\nneed the appropriate key to decrypt and\n\n81\n00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,370\nretrieve that plain text back out.\n\n82\n00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,260\nAnd it's one of the most common ways\nto provide that confidentiality.\n\n83\n00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,900\nBecause if you don't have access to the\nkey then you're not gonna be able to get\n\n84\n00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,430\naccess to that data.\n\n85\n00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,050\nI can show you a real quick\nexample here of some encryption.\n\n86\n00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,240\nWhat I've got on my screen here\nis just a spreadsheet, and\n\n87\n00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,980\nI've made a basic cipher algorithm.\n\n88\n00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,840\nThis is,\nif you're familiar with encryption,\n\n89\n00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,340\nthis is what's known as a Caesar cipher.\n\n90\n00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,720\nIt's just a shift in characters.\n\n91\n00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,180\nAcross the top, I have our English\nalphabet, my letters here.\n\n92\n00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,670\nOn the next row you can see it's the same\nalphabet but everything is shifted over,\n\n93\n00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,050\nin this case by three characters, and\n\n94\n00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,510\nthen at the end it wraps\nback around after the Z.\n\n95\n00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,650\nWe go back to the A, B and C.\n\n96\n00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,350\nAnd all I'm going to do\nto do the encryption\n\n97\n00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,250\nis to find the letter I'm looking for\nacross that top row.\n\n98\n00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,150\nLet's say I want to encrypt the letter K.\n\n99\n00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,850\nWell, the letter K simply becomes an N,\nall right?\n\n100\n00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,970\nSo if we take an example here, I've got my\nplain text, my human readable hello world.\n\n101\n00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,400\nMy cipher text then,\nthe first letter would be an h.\n\n102\n00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,960\nAnd if I look at the h, that becomes a k.\n\n103\n00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,460\nSo you can see the first letter\nof my cipher text is a k.\n\n104\n00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,722\nThe next letter was an e,\nwhich becomes an h, so there's my h, and\n\n105\n00:05:37,722 --> 00:05:42,800\non down the road proceeding letter\nby letter through that plain text.\n\n106\n00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,250\nSo now this is known as my cipher text.\n\n107\n00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,990\nThis is my encrypted form.\n\n108\n00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,930\nAnd if you didn't know,\nif I was to erase this.\n\n109\n00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,560\nYou didn't know what\nthe original text was and\n\n110\n00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,570\nif you didn't know what algorithm,\nwhat method I use to encrypt that data or\n\n111\n00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,440\nthe key I used, more specifically, then\nyou would not be able to read that data.\n\n112\n00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,630\nIf you know the key, though,\n\n113\n00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,850\nif you know I shifted three characters\nto the right, all you would have to do\n\n114\n00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,810\nthen to decrypt it would be to shift\nthree characters back to the left.\n\n115\n00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,380\nSo you would just do the opposite.\n\n116\n00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,490\nA k then would go back to an h,\nand on down the row.\n\n117\n00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,230\nAnd you can get\nthe original text back out.\n\n118\n00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,800\nBut if you don't know the key,\nyou're not gonna get access or\n\n119\n00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,320\nyou're not gonna get that data.\n\n120\n00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,240\n>> Yeah, now what Mike just showed\nyou guys is a very simple cipher,\n\n121\n00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,730\none we could do in our head.\n\n122\n00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,790\nThe ciphers that your computer\nuses are far more advanced.\n\n123\n00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:39,140\nUsing hundreds or even thousands of bits\nof encryption security to be able to give\n\n124\n00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:44,490\nyou cipher text that is near impossible\nto reverse unless you've got that key.\n\n125\n00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,770\nSo every time you browse to a website and\nit goes to a secure connection,\n\n126\n00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,000\nthat little lock appears.\n\n127\n00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,340\nOr every time you fire up\nyour company VPN connection.\n\n128\n00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,420\nAny time you do that kind of stuff,\nyou're doing really strong encryption\n\n129\n00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,480\non the back-end that would be very,\nvery difficult for somebody to break in.\n\n130\n00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,095\nAnd that means any data you transmit\nover that connection is confidential.\n\n131\n00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:10,410\nOnly you and the person you're\nconnecting to will be able to read and\n\n132\n00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,040\nunderstand that data\nbecause you have that key.\n\n133\n00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,080\nEverybody else just sees garbled gibberish\non the network and your data is safe.\n\n134\n00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,150\nSo inside of the information\nsecurity world,\n\n135\n00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,370\nconfidentiality is one of the things\nthat we've got to provide.\n\n136\n00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,303\nEverything that we do in terms of\ninformation security should contribute to\n\n137\n00:07:29,303 --> 00:07:33,090\nat least one of the three little\ncontents of the CIA triad.\n\n138\n00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,432\nVPNs, SSL,\nthey all contribute to confidentiality.\n\n139\n00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:39,460\n>> And encryption's not the only way\nthat we provide confidentiality.\n\n140\n00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,410\nIn fact, just using your user ID and\npassword, right?\n\n141\n00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,700\nWhen you log onto your system at work,\nyou've got your My Documents and\n\n142\n00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,340\nthose other folders that\nonly you have access to.\n\n143\n00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,810\nOnce you log on, you get access to those.\n\n144\n00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,861\nI don't have access to those, for example.\n\n145\n00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:55,431\nYour coworkers can't get into\nyour My Documents folder.\n\n146\n00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:57,261\nSo that ID, that username and\n\n147\n00:07:57,261 --> 00:08:00,931\npassword is providing a layer\nOf confidentiality as well.\n\n148\n00:08:00,931 --> 00:08:03,281\nAccess control is Donner\ndoing the same thing.\n\n149\n00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:07,820\nWe go to a resource and\nsay an NTFS partition.\n\n150\n00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,120\nWe can control who has read and\nwho has right, who has full control and\n\n151\n00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,260\nthings like that.\n\n152\n00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,990\nThat is again, giving us another\nlevel of confidentiality.\n\n153\n00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,230\nRemember confidentiality doesn't\nnecessarily mean you don't get access to\n\n154\n00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,260\nthe data at all.\n\n155\n00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,770\nBut I can control what level\nof access you have too.\n\n156\n00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,430\nSo that's another part of confidentiality\nand we talk about security.\n\n157\n00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,730\nWe're always gonna talk about layers of\ndefense having more than one layer so\n\n158\n00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,162\nwe can start combining\nthese methods as well.\n\n159\n00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:36,812\nYou're gonna have to have\na password to log on to my system.\n\n160\n00:08:36,812 --> 00:08:39,798\nYou're gonna have to have\npermissions to access that file, and\n\n161\n00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:42,510\nyou're gonna need the key\nto decrypt that file.\n\n162\n00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,780\nSo we can add all three\nof those layers for\n\n163\n00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,570\nexample, to provide that confidentiality\nfor that particular document.\n\n164\n00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,570\n>> And don't forget the low tech\nsolutions that factor into this.\n\n165\n00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,090\nIf I want to keep my computer safe,\n\n166\n00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,220\nit might be as simple as locking\nthe door to my office, right?\n\n167\n00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,230\nNow, somebody can't physically get\nin the room where my computer is and\n\n168\n00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,720\nmy data stays private or\n\n169\n00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,190\nwhen I'm throwing papers away that I\nprinted I run them through a shredder.\n\n170\n00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,360\nThat shredder is part of what's providing\nconfidentiality, nobody is gonna be able\n\n171\n00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,920\nto read these documents cause I've\ndestroyed them at this point.\n\n172\n00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,890\nSo confidentiality is a big area, and\n\n173\n00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,850\nin information security we're\nsecuring the information.\n\n174\n00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,130\nWe're not securing technology.\n\n175\n00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,740\nWe're not securing just our computer.\n\n176\n00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,460\nIt's the information in all of its forms,\nand that's why it's such a big topic.\n\n177\n00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,690\n>> Exactly.\n\n178\n00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,770\nAll right, and if we move on into our\ntriad then we got confidentiality.\n\n179\n00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,730\nThat's our first leg of our triad.\n\n180\n00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,910\nThe next leg is gonna be\nsomething known as integrity.\n\n181\n00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,170\nAnd really if we wanna define\nintegrity in a simple way,\n\n182\n00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,100\nit just means to make sure that the data,\n\n183\n00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,690\nthe information is not modified\neither maliciously or accidentally.\n\n184\n00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,940\nIt doesn't have to be\nan intentional attack.\n\n185\n00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,900\nAll right, we could have data\ncorruption and things like that.\n\n186\n00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,050\nSo integrity is all about making\nsure that the data is not modified,\n\n187\n00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,605\nthat it remains as it was intended.\n\n188\n00:09:54,605 --> 00:09:58,650\n>> Yeah, if you're using\na network like the Internet,\n\n189\n00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,940\nyou're passing across routers\nthat you don't control,\n\n190\n00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,460\nthat you don't necessarily even know\nthe companies that are involved in.\n\n191\n00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,780\nSo you may pass across 10,\n15 different routers, that means 10 or\n\n192\n00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,780\n15 different Internet service providers.\n\n193\n00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,370\nAnybody along that journey\ncould intercept your traffic.\n\n194\n00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,830\nWell it's bad enough they intercept it and\nread it, but\n\n195\n00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,740\nif they want to go really bad.\n\n196\n00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,020\nThey can modify that traffic and\nthen send it along and\n\n197\n00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,140\nit looks like it came from you but it's\nbeen modified beyond your original intent.\n\n198\n00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,180\nThat means the integrity has\nbeen broken for your data.\n\n199\n00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,320\nWe need ways to validate that integrity to\nensure that our information hasn't been\n\n200\n00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,000\ntampered with.\n\n201\n00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,150\nAnd there's a number of technologies\nout there that can do it.\n\n202\n00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,830\nSo Mike, you've got an example\nof like an integrity violation.\n\n203\n00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,640\n>> I do, exactly.\n\n204\n00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,220\nI've got a simple little drawing I drew\nup here in this is a great example.\n\n205\n00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,590\nThis is what can happen out\nthere in the real world.\n\n206\n00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:50,420\nI've got a situation where Alice wants\nto send a check say over to Adam.\n\n207\n00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,230\nSo initially she writes this check and\nit says, pay to Adam the amount of $100.\n\n208\n00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,970\nBut somewhere during\nthe transmission of that information\n\n209\n00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,960\nwe can see there was\nan unauthorized modification.\n\n210\n00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,160\nAnd when that check is to the other end,\nall of a sudden it says\n\n211\n00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,370\nnot Adam getting a $100, but\nit says Don is retrieving a 100,000.\n\n212\n00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,840\nWait, did you change that on?\n\n213\n00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,488\n>> I love this example.\n\n214\n00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:12,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's my favorite example in\n\n215\n00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,610\nthe whole show.\n\n216\n00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:18,335\n>> Somehow, Don became the recipient\nof that $100,000 check there but\n\n217\n00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:21,842\nthat's a great example of\nwhere integrity was not kept.\n\n218\n00:11:21,842 --> 00:11:22,920\n>> Right.\n\n219\n00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,650\n>> We lost our integrity\non that information.\n\n220\n00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,554\n>> So one great way that we can ensure\nthat integrity is through the use of\n\n221\n00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,270\nsomething called a digital signature.\n\n222\n00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:34,945\nAnd a digital signature is where we run\nlike a little mathematical algorithm\n\n223\n00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:38,590\nagainst the data and\nit creates a certain number.\n\n224\n00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,660\nAnd when somebody receives the data\nthat we're sending they can run the same\n\n225\n00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,460\nalgorithm and they should get the same\nnumber, the same response that we got.\n\n226\n00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,070\nIf they match,\nthe data wasn't tampered with.\n\n227\n00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,440\nBut if the data was tampered with,\n\n228\n00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,600\nwhen they run the algorithm\nthey'll get a different response.\n\n229\n00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,470\nThey won't match and that lets them\nknow the data has been tampered with.\n\n230\n00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,630\nNow, that sounds like a lot of work.\n\n231\n00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,572\nIt is a lot of work if-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n232\n00:11:58,572 --> 00:11:59,630\n>> We were to do it ourselves.\n\n233\n00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,600\nBut your computer can do this near\ninstantly in the background, and so\n\n234\n00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,190\nwe see it in use in a lot\nof different systems\n\n235\n00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,050\nto make sure that our data\ndoesn't get tampered with.\n\n236\n00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,220\n>> Exactly.\nI can give you guys\n\n237\n00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,440\nan example of that as well.\n\n238\n00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,090\nIf we wanna flip over here to my\nscreen again, this is a simple online\n\n239\n00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:17,520\nhashing calculator, and it's got\nthe ability to drop files in here.\n\n240\n00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,678\nI'm just gonna do a simple string,\nand I'll put in something like hello,\n\n241\n00:12:21,678 --> 00:12:22,675\nif I could spell.\n\n242\n00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:23,820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hello, world.\n\n243\n00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,560\nEverybody's favorite first\nprogramming string there.\n\n244\n00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,910\nAnd I can see then below,\n\n245\n00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:34,930\nit has generated this zone as\na hash value or a message digest.\n\n246\n00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,570\nAnd if I take that same information,\nI'm gonna cut it you see it's gone.\n\n247\n00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:42,190\nAnd if I paste it back in there, I know it\nprobably difficult for us to see at this\n\n248\n00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,330\npoint, but if I copied those numbers out\nyou could see they're exactly the same.\n\n249\n00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:50,950\nBecause I'm putting the same input,\nI'm always gonna get the same output.\n\n250\n00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,370\nIf I change a single character in there.\n\n251\n00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,460\nNotice that it immediately changed\nthat hash value down there.\n\n252\n00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:02,530\nIf I take that back out, it changes\nback to the original hash value.\n\n253\n00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,800\nThat's the way these\ndigital signatures work.\n\n254\n00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,050\nIf anything changes,\nthat value is gonna change and\n\n255\n00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,320\nthat's a way that I can\ndetect that change.\n\n256\n00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,770\nAnd this isn't just about\neverything we do, right?\n\n257\n00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,580\nWhen we send the packets\nacross the network,\n\n258\n00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:19,480\nTCPIP as a check sum in there that uses\nthis system to make sure that the packet\n\n259\n00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,020\nat the other end is the same\nas the packet that was sent.\n\n260\n00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,300\nWhen you boot up your system,\n\n261\n00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,960\nit checks your system files to make\nsure that they haven't been modified.\n\n262\n00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,620\nWell it just keeps a little table.\n\n263\n00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,070\nIt's taken all your system files,\nand it's hashed them.\n\n264\n00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:36,070\nAnd it has those recorded and\nwhen it starts up it hashes them again and\n\n265\n00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,020\ncompares them.\n\n266\n00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,770\nIf they're still the same, if those values\nmatch, then I know those system files.\n\n267\n00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,410\nI don't have to go bit by\nbit by bit looking at it.\n\n268\n00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,860\nAll I have to do is\ncompare the signatures.\n\n269\n00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,730\nIf they match,\nthen that file is still the same.\n\n270\n00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,860\n>> Another way that we can provide\nthis integrity is through encryption.\n\n271\n00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,770\nNow, I know we just mentioned\nencryption in the confidentiality.\n\n272\n00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,240\nWe're gonna mention it here too?\n\n273\n00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,790\nWell if you think about it,\nif you've encrypted your data and\n\n274\n00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,834\nthe attacker can't even\nread it in the first place,\n\n275\n00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:06,040\nhw can they modify something\nthey can't even read?\n\n276\n00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,110\nSo that one kind of kills two\nbirds with one stone, right?\n\n277\n00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,000\nIt knocks them both out.\n\n278\n00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,610\n>> It really does.\n\n279\n00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,630\nIf we flip back over to,\n\n280\n00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,370\nwhere'd I have that on my spreadsheet\nhere I can see that ciphertext, right?\n\n281\n00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,820\nAnd let's say, I wanted to modify it.\n\n282\n00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,690\nWell I don't know the key to decrypt it.\n\n283\n00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,030\nSo I might be able to change it.\n\n284\n00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,630\nI could come in here and change one\nof these letters to something else.\n\n285\n00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:29,390\nGreat, I changed it but when they decrypt\nit, is it gonna make any sense or\n\n286\n00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,940\nis going to be obvious that\nit's been changed, right?\n\n287\n00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,680\nSo encryption does provide both.\n\n288\n00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,500\nIt actually gives you that confidentiality\nas well as integrity, all right.\n\n289\n00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,380\nNot foolproof integrity, but\nit definitely helps with that.\n\n290\n00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,280\n>> And that's really,\n\n291\n00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,740\nthe best solutions address more than\none area inside of the CIA triad.\n\n292\n00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,540\nSo that's how you kind of identify those.\n\n293\n00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,700\nAnd it's why encryption is so commonplace.\n\n294\n00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,080\n>> Exactly, so integrity again, making\nsure that that data is not modified either\n\n295\n00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,270\nintentionally, maliciously or\naccidentally, however we choose to use it.\n\n296\n00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,780\nAnd then the last leg of our little\ntriad here is the availability.\n\n297\n00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,172\nAnd it's funny, Don, when you first\ntalk about this people are like wait,\n\n298\n00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:10,220\nI thought we were talking about security.\n\n299\n00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,780\nHow does availability fit into security?\n\n300\n00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,610\nWell we've gotta make sure\nthe information is available.\n\n301\n00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,360\nI can have it bulletproof secure, right?\n\n302\n00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,620\nI could take that server that has\nall those databases on there.\n\n303\n00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,530\nI could take it offline.\n\n304\n00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:26,140\nI could dump it in a box or\nin a bucket and pour concrete in there.\n\n305\n00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,110\nNobody's gonna get access to that data.\n\n306\n00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,620\nIt's not gonna do me any good though,\nright?\n\n307\n00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,720\nEven the legitimate people, the people\nthat are supposed to have access\n\n308\n00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,630\nto the information are not\ngonna get it either.\n\n309\n00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,980\nSo availability has to be\na part of our security.\n\n310\n00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,490\nIf the information is available to\nwho is supposed to be available to,\n\n311\n00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,272\nit doesn't do me any good.\n\n312\n00:15:45,272 --> 00:15:49,500\n>> Yeah, now availability of the three\ntopics that we covered for the CIA triad.\n\n313\n00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,495\nAvailability is probably the biggest and\nit's also one of the most misunderstood,\n\n314\n00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,589\nbecause it's easy to think about\ncomputers and technology, but\n\n315\n00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,360\nthere's a lot of low tech\ninvolved in availability also.\n\n316\n00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,640\nAt a minimum,\nwe do need to think about our computers.\n\n317\n00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,501\nFor example, let's say on my laptop\nI've got a spreadsheet with data on it\n\n318\n00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:08,661\nthat's really important to me, right?\n\n319\n00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:12,010\nI need to make sure I've got that data.\n\n320\n00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,000\nWell, if a hacker were to break into\nmy computer and erase my hard drive,\n\n321\n00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,891\nI'd lose that data.\n\n322\n00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,671\nThat would be a big deal, right?\n\n323\n00:16:17,671 --> 00:16:19,091\nThat would really be a problem.\n\n324\n00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:21,441\nSo how do I create availability there?\n\n325\n00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:22,871\nWell, there's several options.\n\n326\n00:16:22,871 --> 00:16:25,601\nWe could prevent the hacker from getting\ninto the computer in the first place.\n\n327\n00:16:25,601 --> 00:16:27,431\nSo there's technologies for that.\n\n328\n00:16:27,431 --> 00:16:31,026\nWe can put firewalls and\nanti-virus software, things like that,\n\n329\n00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:34,050\nto help protect us from that intrusion.\n\n330\n00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,000\nOr, we could just back up my hard drive.\n\n331\n00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,035\nIf I've got a backup copy of my hard\ndrive and somebody erases my drive,\n\n332\n00:16:40,035 --> 00:16:40,801\nwell, big deal.\n\n333\n00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:43,546\nI'll just go to my backup,\nI got another copy of it right here, and\n\n334\n00:16:43,546 --> 00:16:44,241\nmy data is safe.\n\n335\n00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:47,581\nMy data is still available even\nthough my hard drive failed.\n\n336\n00:16:47,581 --> 00:16:52,095\nOr somebody broke in and stole my laptop\nor whatever, I still have my data.\n\n337\n00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:57,345\n>> Another way we provide availability\nis backing up those keys.\n\n338\n00:16:57,345 --> 00:17:01,605\nWe talked about encryption, and I can use\nthat to provide confidentiality as well as\n\n339\n00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:05,806\nintegrity, and that I needed that key to\nbe able to get that information backed up.\n\n340\n00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:08,025\nWhat if I lose that key?\n\n341\n00:17:08,025 --> 00:17:09,880\nThat key is no longer available.\n\n342\n00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,860\nSo he's doing something like key escrow or\nmaking sure that we've got a backup\n\n343\n00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,810\ncopy of those keys is also\nproviding a level of availability.\n\n344\n00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,420\n>> Now, when we talk about information\nsecurity, I know, me, in my mind,\n\n345\n00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,821\nthe first thing I think of is\ndefending from the hackers.\n\n346\n00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:26,195\nRight?\nWe gotta keep the bad guys out of\n\n347\n00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:26,721\nour network.\n\n348\n00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:31,011\nBut you're also defending from other\nthings like the forces of nature.\n\n349\n00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:31,611\nRight.\n\n350\n00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:35,551\nHurricanes, thunderstorms,\ntsunami, tidal wave, whatever.\n\n351\n00:17:35,551 --> 00:17:38,886\nAll of these are different things that\ncould come in and affect our network.\n\n352\n00:17:38,886 --> 00:17:41,136\nRight.\nTake this studio, for example.\n\n353\n00:17:41,136 --> 00:17:42,736\nSo here we are recording this show.\n\n354\n00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:47,632\nIf a hurricane came through, or a flood,\nor an earthquake and destroyed the studio,\n\n355\n00:17:47,632 --> 00:17:49,940\nwe couldn't film our show, right?\n\n356\n00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,931\nWhich means our data is no\nlonger available to the viewers.\n\n357\n00:17:52,931 --> 00:17:56,402\nSo, information security is\ngonna have to have plans for\n\n358\n00:17:56,402 --> 00:17:59,250\nwhat to do if there's an earthquake.\n\n359\n00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,030\nNow, that doesn't sound like\nan IT guy kind of thing, is it?\n\n360\n00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,030\nBut it really is, because we've got\nto make sure that our information,\n\n361\n00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:07,900\nwhat's stored in our computers,\n\n362\n00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,100\nis available even in a natural disaster or\nphysical disaster of some sort.\n\n363\n00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,208\n>> Exactly.\nAnd this is where we talk about things\n\n364\n00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:18,371\nlike disaster recovery sites or\nkeeping a copy of those backups offline.\n\n365\n00:18:18,371 --> 00:18:22,461\nAnd I got a little drawing here that I\nwhipped up real quick to show you that\n\n366\n00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:24,960\nconcept of a disaster recovery site.\n\n367\n00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,550\nI've got my corporate network down here\nin the bottom left of this drawing, and\n\n368\n00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,941\nthis is where our file servers are,\nall of our data, and things like that.\n\n369\n00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:35,521\nThat's what we access throughout\nthe business day in a normal situation.\n\n370\n00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:36,627\nBut as Don said,\n\n371\n00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:42,090\nwe've got natural disasters that can\noccur oOr human disasters as well.\n\n372\n00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:46,497\nHurricane comes through, earthquake,\nfires, bombs, what have you.\n\n373\n00:18:46,497 --> 00:18:51,134\nSomething happens to that corporate\nnetwork, well, we can still survive,\n\n374\n00:18:51,134 --> 00:18:55,699\nbecause we have made duplicates of our\ninformation over here in our disaster\n\n375\n00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:57,210\nrecovery site.\n\n376\n00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,290\nNow, we're not going to get\ninto the nuts and bolts of how.\n\n377\n00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,601\nThere's several ways I could\nprovide that redundancy.\n\n378\n00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:05,525\nBut having that other site,\nif my corporate network disappears,\n\n379\n00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:09,680\nwell, we can now connect\nto that data recovery site.\n\n380\n00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,701\nAnd that's a way that we can\nprovide that availability.\n\n381\n00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:16,089\nAnother method you might see on\nan individual server example,\n\n382\n00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,501\nlike a web server or a file server.\n\n383\n00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:21,031\nI've got to make sure that\nthat information is available.\n\n384\n00:19:21,031 --> 00:19:23,871\nIf my web server goes down,\npeople can't come buy my product.\n\n385\n00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,120\nMy company doesn't make any money.\n\n386\n00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,878\nOr if that file server goes down,\nmy employees can't get access to\n\n387\n00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:31,440\nthe information to find the customers\nthat they need to call or\n\n388\n00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,541\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n389\n00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:36,919\nSo here's an example of server cluster,\nwhere we've taken multiple\n\n390\n00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,011\nphysical servers back here and\nwe've clustered them together.\n\n391\n00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:42,640\nIn other words, basically,\n\n392\n00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,881\nwhat we're doing is creating what appears\nto the network as a single server.\n\n393\n00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:49,041\nSo when this end user or the customer or\n\n394\n00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,214\nwhatever connects to the file server or\nthe web server,\n\n395\n00:19:52,214 --> 00:19:56,621\nthey're not really connecting directly\nto one of these physical machines.\n\n396\n00:19:56,621 --> 00:20:01,041\nThey're connecting to here, and then\nusing some different methods that we have\n\n397\n00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:05,331\navailable, like clustering with Windows\nand things like that, that request\n\n398\n00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:10,002\ncould be sent to any one of these four\nphysical machines in the background.\n\n399\n00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:13,981\nNow, if one of these machines happens\nto go offline or disappear, it's okay.\n\n400\n00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:17,992\nWe can still access that website because\nthe requests can just be sent to one of\n\n401\n00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:19,361\nthe remaining machines.\n\n402\n00:20:19,361 --> 00:20:23,480\nSo this is another way we can\nprovide that availability.\n\n403\n00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,970\n>> Now also, our hardware vendors and\nour software vendors,\n\n404\n00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,491\nthey want to help us provide availability.\n\n405\n00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:35,092\nSo there's new attacks, new attack vectors\nthat hackers can use to break into our\n\n406\n00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:37,101\nsystems that come out all the time.\n\n407\n00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:39,621\nEvery single day,\nthere's new attacks that are discovered.\n\n408\n00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:44,508\nSo vendors like Microsoft and\nApple, Dell, Lenovo, you name it,\n\n409\n00:20:44,508 --> 00:20:49,226\nany IT company out there,\nare continually pushing out patches,\n\n410\n00:20:49,226 --> 00:20:54,320\nhot fixes, and updates to keep\nour systems running smoothly.\n\n411\n00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,190\nI know there's been some really high\nvisibility SSL attacks over the last few\n\n412\n00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,970\nmonths, and each time the web browser\nvendors and the operating system\n\n413\n00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,140\nvendors have been quick to push out\nupdates to your machines to protect you.\n\n414\n00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,961\nThat's nice because we don't\nhave to figure it out, right?\n\n415\n00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:11,990\nThe vendor takes care, of course.\n\n416\n00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,251\nBut it is our responsibility to\nperform those updates, right?\n\n417\n00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:18,943\nYou, as the viewer, you may have had that\none at one point where your computer says,\n\n418\n00:21:18,943 --> 00:21:20,295\nhey, updates are available.\n\n419\n00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:22,995\nAnd you say, I'll do it later,\nor cancel, or whatever.\n\n420\n00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:25,925\nWell, you're putting your availability\nat risk when you do that.\n\n421\n00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:29,795\nYou're are susceptible to whatever that\nexploit is until you do the update.\n\n422\n00:21:29,795 --> 00:21:31,593\nSo the sooner we do those updates,\n\n423\n00:21:31,593 --> 00:21:35,500\nthe more we guarantee that our systems\nwill be available and operational.\n\n424\n00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,561\nWe minimize that threat.\n\n425\n00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:37,361\n>> Exactly.\n\n426\n00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:41,274\nThat's one of the things that a lot of\npeople forget about is doing that general\n\n427\n00:21:41,274 --> 00:21:45,722\nmaintenance, doing those updates really is\nhelping us with our information security,\n\n428\n00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,641\nand it's a big part of that CIA triad.\n\n429\n00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:51,734\nAnd then we talked, we also mentioned,\nI think, before the show, we talked about\n\n430\n00:21:51,734 --> 00:21:55,726\nphysical security, Don, putting fences\naround buildings, having cameras.\n\n431\n00:21:55,726 --> 00:21:59,831\nThis is helping keep my\ninfrastructure safe as well and\n\n432\n00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:02,426\nprovide a level of availability.\n\n433\n00:22:02,426 --> 00:22:03,896\n>> You know, you mention fences.\n\n434\n00:22:03,896 --> 00:22:06,862\nThere was a story I heard a few\nyears back about a data center,\n\n435\n00:22:06,862 --> 00:22:07,976\nI was out in Colorado.\n\n436\n00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:10,436\nIt was state of the art data center,\nright?\n\n437\n00:22:10,436 --> 00:22:11,256\nMultimillion dollar.\n\n438\n00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:16,121\nThey had server racks, cooling systems,\nredundant power, redundant network.\n\n439\n00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:21,091\nThey had all sorts of just great stuff in\nthis facility to be completely redundant.\n\n440\n00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:24,401\nIf power went out, they didn't have\none set of external generators.\n\n441\n00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:26,121\nThey had four external sets of generators.\n\n442\n00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:28,890\nI mean,\nthey just had tons of infrastructure.\n\n443\n00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,000\nIt was as redundant as you could want it.\n\n444\n00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,751\nWell, somebody performed\na denial service attack.\n\n445\n00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:37,205\nNow a denial of service, that just means\nthey somehow stop your service from being\n\n446\n00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:39,621\navailable to the customers\nthrough any means possible.\n\n447\n00:22:39,621 --> 00:22:42,241\nAnd it's easy to think of\nthose movies where people do,\n\n448\n00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:44,601\nthey hack in using all\nsorts of coding craziness.\n\n449\n00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:47,220\nBut the way they did it?\n\n450\n00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,768\nThey went to the outside of the building\nto the air conditioning units, and\n\n451\n00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:53,020\nthey stuck sticks,\nlittle wooden dowel rods,\n\n452\n00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,990\ndown in the fans of the air conditioning\nunits to stop them from spinning.\n\n453\n00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:00,320\nAnd the temperature increased inside of\nthe building cuz it didn't have a way to\n\n454\n00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,920\npush heat out, and\nthe servers went into thermal shutdown.\n\n455\n00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,671\nSo, they didn't even\nhave get in the building.\n\n456\n00:23:05,671 --> 00:23:07,541\nThey didn't even have to\nknow how to hack anything.\n\n457\n00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:09,780\nThey just stuck sticks in\nthe air conditioning units.\n\n458\n00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,151\n>> It could have been\na ten-year-old doing this.\n\n459\n00:23:11,151 --> 00:23:13,621\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, and the way you prevent that?\n\n460\n00:23:13,621 --> 00:23:14,511\nYou put up a fence.\n\n461\n00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:17,131\nA fence with some razor wire or whatever.\n\n462\n00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:18,541\nNow people can't get to the AC units.\n\n463\n00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:22,060\nIt's easy to overlook physical security.\n\n464\n00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,000\nIt's not, you know,\n\n465\n00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,731\nyou don't have to have a PhD in\nComputer Science to put up a fence.\n\n466\n00:23:25,731 --> 00:23:27,991\nSo that kind of stuff is easy overlook.\n\n467\n00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:32,351\nAnd a guard that patrols a building,\nthat helps with availability.\n\n468\n00:23:32,351 --> 00:23:34,569\nRight.\nWe deter somebody trying to break in when\n\n469\n00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:36,821\nthey see somebody\npatrolling that building.\n\n470\n00:23:36,821 --> 00:23:40,741\nThese are all steps that fall\nunder information security.\n\n471\n00:23:40,741 --> 00:23:45,500\nSo don't pigeon-hole your mind into\nthinking just of computers when it\n\n472\n00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,691\ncomes to information security.\n\n473\n00:23:47,691 --> 00:23:50,601\nIt's not all about firewalls,\nand VPNs, and antivirus.\n\n474\n00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:55,216\nIt's also about more mundane\nthings like insurance policies,\n\n475\n00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:59,151\nsecurity guards, locked doors,\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n476\n00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:02,631\n>> And it's not just the security,\nthe IT people that are responsible for\n\n477\n00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:03,391\nthis, right?\n\n478\n00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:06,641\nIt's you, it's I,\nit's everybody that uses that network.\n\n479\n00:24:06,641 --> 00:24:10,581\nI've gotta make sure that I'm locking my\nscreen when I walk away from my computer.\n\n480\n00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:14,486\nI've gotta make sure that I'm not\npropping that backdoor open so\n\n481\n00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:17,621\nthat anybody could walk through and\nnot have a code.\n\n482\n00:24:17,621 --> 00:24:21,141\nSo we've got to make sure that we\nunderstand that everybody's responsible.\n\n483\n00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:23,631\nAnd that's really what\nCIA triad is all about.\n\n484\n00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:30,380\nIt's a general outline telling us what\nit means to keep our information secure.\n\n485\n00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:35,070\n>> Well, Mike, I think we've done a pretty\ngood job of running down the three\n\n486\n00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,706\nmain areas of information security.\n\n487\n00:24:36,706 --> 00:24:40,692\nSo that just to recap, we did\nconfidentiality, which is making sure that\n\n488\n00:24:40,692 --> 00:24:44,895\nour data was only visible by people\nwe intended to be visible to.\n\n489\n00:24:44,895 --> 00:24:48,856\nWe did integrity to make sure that our\ndata wasn't modified after we sent it.\n\n490\n00:24:48,856 --> 00:24:52,245\nSo, if somebody gets it,\nit is the way we intended it to be.\n\n491\n00:24:52,245 --> 00:24:53,381\nAnd then, we did availability.\n\n492\n00:24:53,381 --> 00:24:57,317\nMaking sure that our information is\navailable to the people who want to use it\n\n493\n00:24:57,317 --> 00:24:58,621\nwhen they want to use it.\n\n494\n00:24:58,621 --> 00:25:02,175\nThose are the three main things that\nwe need to provide with any kind of\n\n495\n00:25:02,175 --> 00:25:05,621\ninformation security environment,\nand they're all critical.\n\n496\n00:25:05,621 --> 00:25:07,601\nYou can't just have one and\nignore the others.\n\n497\n00:25:07,601 --> 00:25:09,021\nYou've really got to work on all three.\n\n498\n00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:09,871\n>> Exactly.\n\n499\n00:25:09,871 --> 00:25:11,703\nThink about a tripod.\nIf you've got two legs on a tripod,\n\n500\n00:25:11,703 --> 00:25:13,161\nit's not gonna stand up too well.\n\n501\n00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:14,950\n[LAUGH] Gotta have all three legs there.\n\n502\n00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,911\n>> We could have two, and like,\nlean against the wall or something.\n\n503\n00:25:17,911 --> 00:25:19,401\n[LAUGH]\n>> A couple bookshelves on one side.\n\n504\n00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:20,981\n>> All right.\n\n505\n00:25:20,981 --> 00:25:24,351\nWell, ladies and gentlemen, I think it's a\ngood spot for us to wrap up this episode.\n\n506\n00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:26,801\nI hope you guys enjoyed it,\nand be sure to stay tuned.\n\n507\n00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:28,461\nRight.\nThis is the first episode.\n\n508\n00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:30,241\nWe've got a whole series ahead of us.\n\n509\n00:25:30,241 --> 00:25:33,346\nWe're going to dive into all sorts\nof different technologies and\n\n510\n00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:36,291\ncomponents that make up a good\ninformation security policy.\n\n511\n00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:38,350\nSo, stay tuned for that.\n\n512\n00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,381\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pizet.\n\n513\n00:25:40,381 --> 00:25:41,431\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n514\n00:25:41,431 --> 00:25:46,950\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n",

your host, Don Pezet.\n\n4\n00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,670\nBack again with Mr Mike Roderick.\n\n5\n00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,400\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,430\n>> It's going fantastic,\n\n7\n00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,080\nDon, because we've got another episode of\nour security fundamentals coming your way,\n\n8\n00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,360\nand in this episode, we're going to\nbe talking about authentication.\n\n9\n00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,800\nVery important part of security.\n\n10\n00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,860\nI think most people kind of familiar\nwith the concept of authentication, but\n\n11\n00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,550\nit's one of those ones where there's a lot\nof misconceptions as well when it comes to\n\n12\n00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,280\nauthentication.\n\n13\n00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,340\nSo let's dive into it.\n\n14\n00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,940\nLet's break it down and explain to\nyou all the different methods and\n\n15\n00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,010\nways that we can provide it an occasion.\n\n16\n00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,080\nBut before we go there, Don,\nwe wanna define authentication, right?\n\n17\n00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,330\nCuz it's one of those terms,\nwe hear all the time, but\n\n18\n00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,080\na lot of people misunderstand\nwhat it actually means.\n\n19\n00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,420\nAnd authentication,\nwhat it boils down to is\n\n20\n00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,885\nbeing able to prove the identity\nof someone or something.\n\n21\n00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:02,585\nIt really doesn't have to be a person.\n\n22\n00:01:02,585 --> 00:01:05,435\nA computer can authenticate as well.\n\n23\n00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:06,835\nWe can authenticate software, so\n\n24\n00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:09,085\nthere's different ways we go\nabout this authentication.\n\n25\n00:01:09,085 --> 00:01:13,325\nWe most commonly think about it\nas us sitting at our computer or\n\n26\n00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:15,555\nat our device and logging in.\n\n27\n00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:17,100\nBut there are others.\n\n28\n00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,210\nAnd what I see a lot of times\nis people will misunderstand\n\n29\n00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,440\nthe difference between\nan authentication and authorization.\n\n30\n00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,800\nThey'll try to use those\nterms interchangeably, and\n\n31\n00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,020\nit's really important that we\nunderstand the difference.\n\n32\n00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,720\nBecause if we're calling tech support of\nif we're calling somebody to try to get\n\n33\n00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,590\nhelp, and we're telling him it's\nan authentication issue but\n\n34\n00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,460\nit's actually an authorization issue,\nthat changes the troubleshooting method.\n\n35\n00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,170\nIt changes how they're going to\ngo about fixing that problem.\n\n36\n00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,980\nSo remember authentication\nis proving your identity,\n\n37\n00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,970\nor verifying the identity of someone or\nsomething.\n\n38\n00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:50,190\nAuthorization is determining whether or\nnot that person or\n\n39\n00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,760\nthing has permissions to access\nwhatever it is we're protecting.\n\n40\n00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,490\nSo I cannot authorize somebody\n\n41\n00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,630\nunless they've gone through\nwith an occasion first.\n\n42\n00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:04,800\nIn other words, I can't tell you if you\nhave read permission over this document\n\n43\n00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,130\nif I don't know who you are.\n\n44\n00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,230\nSo successful authentication\nhas to occur first.\n\n45\n00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,870\nAuthorization occurs after that.\n\n46\n00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,100\nRemember authentication is\nverifying your identity.\n\n47\n00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,650\nAnd Don, there's several things we\ncan base authentication on, right?\n\n48\n00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,890\n>> Yeah,\nthere is a whole just sordid array.\n\n49\n00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,770\nAnd it ranges from technical matters\nof authentication to non-technical.\n\n50\n00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,130\nIf you think about\nauthentication its basest level,\n\n51\n00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,660\nbe something like the locks on your house,\nright?\n\n52\n00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,060\nSo if you have a lock on your front door.\n\n53\n00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,710\nIf you have the key you can unlock it,\nand you can get in.\n\n54\n00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,570\nYou just authenticated.\n\n55\n00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,480\nYou said, I'm supposed to be\nhere because I have the key.\n\n56\n00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,040\nBut that's not a very good form\nof authentication is it, right?\n\n57\n00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,070\nBecause if I leave\nthe key on the ground and\n\n58\n00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,580\nsomebody finds it they can\nnow be authenticated, right?\n\n59\n00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,600\nAnd, are they supposed\nto be there in my house?\n\n60\n00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,410\nNo, they just happened to get the key.\n\n61\n00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,700\nSo basic authentication\nisn't very flexible, but\n\n62\n00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,380\nin computers we can get really advanced.\n\n63\n00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,340\nNow, the most common type of\nauthentication that we have out there is\n\n64\n00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,570\nthe username and\npassword combination, right?\n\n65\n00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:12,360\n>> Yeah, and we talk about authentication,\nthere's really three main factors\n\n66\n00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,610\nwe can base authentication off of,\nit's something you know or\n\n67\n00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:20,470\nsomething you have or something you are.\n\n68\n00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,660\nSo those are the big three\nsecurity factors that we\n\n69\n00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,480\ncan use in the authentication method.\n\n70\n00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,870\nAnd what Don's referred to, username and\n\n71\n00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,350\npassword, that's based on\nsomething you know, right?\n\n72\n00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,750\nYou know the password that's\nassociated with your account.\n\n73\n00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,270\nSo if you can type it in,\n\n74\n00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:39,810\nthat's the computer's way of verifying\nthat you are the owner of that account.\n\n75\n00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,280\nI don't know your password.\n\n76\n00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,890\nI can't log in as you.\n\n77\n00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,800\nSo, and that's a very common method\nbecause it's very easy to implement.\n\n78\n00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,720\nAnd it's built into most of our\noperating systems and our devices.\n\n79\n00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,370\nSo there's not extra hardware to manage or\nmaintain or anything like that.\n\n80\n00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,030\nSo it's very simple.\n\n81\n00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,670\nIt's easy.\n\n82\n00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,070\nIt's also one of the weaker forms\nof authentication because it's so\n\n83\n00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,880\neasy to people share their\npassword with other people.\n\n84\n00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,330\nThey write them down.\n\n85\n00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,530\nHackers try to guess your password or\nbreak your password, so\n\n86\n00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,560\nit is not the strongest method.\n\n87\n00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,380\nIn fact, after I say all that, you might\nthink, Well, why the heck do we use it?\n\n88\n00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,670\nIt's, again, because it's so\neasy to implement.\n\n89\n00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,910\nIt's already built in to\nmost of the stuff we have.\n\n90\n00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,460\nAll right, let me show you a quick example\nof authentication using user ID and\n\n91\n00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:22,990\npassword.\n\n92\n00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,130\nHere I've got a Windows device pulled up,\nand it's actually on my lock screen.\n\n93\n00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,640\nI'm gonna just type in my password.\n\n94\n00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,390\nIf I type it in incorrectly,\nI will get something like this.\n\n95\n00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,100\nSo I am not authenticated successful.\n\n96\n00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,520\n>> And that was planned, right?\nThat was part of the lab.\n\n97\n00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,100\n>> [LAUGH] I'll show you\nwhat it looked like there.\n\n98\n00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,356\nIf I type in the password correctly,\nI guess I should have told you that first.\n\n99\n00:04:45,356 --> 00:04:47,750\nWe can say that I'm able to\nget back into my desktop.\n\n100\n00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,310\nSo that's one of the ways that we\ncan authentic, verify your identity.\n\n101\n00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:53,010\nIf you don't know the password,\n\n102\n00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,220\nyou're not going to be able to\nhopefully get on to that system.\n\n103\n00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,690\n>> Now that that type of authentication,\n\n104\n00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,860\nthat's not much different than the example\nI gave of using the key to a house, right?\n\n105\n00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,850\nWith the key to the house,\nyou unlock it with that key,\n\n106\n00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,470\nanybody could get that key from you and\nget in.\n\n107\n00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,420\nI could get Mike's password, and\nif I log in as Mike, with his password,\n\n108\n00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,830\nthen it's gonna think that I'm him.\n\n109\n00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,460\nIt has no way of knowing\nthat I'm not Mike.\n\n110\n00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,310\nI just happen to be somebody\nwho knows the password.\n\n111\n00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:20,820\n>> Exactly, and that is one of the big\nvulnerabilities of that method.\n\n112\n00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,460\nIt's just, again, so easy to implement\nthat it's still very commonly used.\n\n113\n00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,120\nSo back to something you know,\nwe got that that username and password.\n\n114\n00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,430\nIt could be a PIN that you had to punch\nin, like on a door here, our building,\n\n115\n00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,330\nwe have entry way doors have\na little keypad on the side of them.\n\n116\n00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,980\nAnd if I come up to that door, the door's\nlocked, it's got a magnetic lock on it.\n\n117\n00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,900\nI can punch in the appropriate PIN,\nand I can get that door to open.\n\n118\n00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,050\nAlso something you're probably\nfamiliar with, secret questions.\n\n119\n00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,900\nYou see this a lot on websites now.\n\n120\n00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,290\nAll right, where you have to go in,\nand you have to verify your identity.\n\n121\n00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:59,170\nAnd they're gonna ask you the name of your\nfirst pet or your mother's maiden name or\n\n122\n00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,330\nsomething like that.\n\n123\n00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,010\nAgain, that's something that\nhopefully only you know, and\n\n124\n00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,400\nthey can verify your identity that way.\n\n125\n00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,520\nSo first category of authentication\nis based on something you know.\n\n126\n00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,380\nSecond category is going to be\nbased on something you have, and\n\n127\n00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,800\nthis is a system that\nwe're seeing more and\n\n128\n00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,850\nmore of, because the cost is\ncoming down on the equipment.\n\n129\n00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:27,260\nThis is things like key fobs or\nsmart cards and some of these are gonna\n\n130\n00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,200\ncross boundaries and we'll explain\nwhat I mean here in just a little bit.\n\n131\n00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,710\nBut something that's in your possession\nis what we're talking about with this\n\n132\n00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,210\ncategory.\n\n133\n00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,450\nAnd Don,\nI think you've got an example of a token\n\n134\n00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,680\nwhich is an example of something you have.\n\n135\n00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,830\n>> Yeah, actually I got two examples of\ntokens cuz I use these personally, right?\n\n136\n00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,800\nNow, for my own accounts whenever you have\na presence on the Internet, like if you\n\n137\n00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,800\nhave a Facebook page or Twitter or\nwhatever, people can discover you.\n\n138\n00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,250\nIt's kind of the whole\npurpose of social media.\n\n139\n00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,870\nWell, if they can discover you they\ncan attempt to log in as your account.\n\n140\n00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,155\nIf I know your email, email address,\nor if I know Mike's email address,\n\n141\n00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:04,455\nI can just try to log in as him, so if I\ncould get his password, I could get in.\n\n142\n00:07:04,455 --> 00:07:09,205\nBut it would be even harder to get in if\nyou combined it with something you have.\n\n143\n00:07:09,205 --> 00:07:10,555\nSo let me show you an example.\n\n144\n00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,765\nI've got with me right here,\nthis is a hardware token.\n\n145\n00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:16,905\nAnd this little guy right here,\nI put it on my key chain.\n\n146\n00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:21,820\nAnd whenever I go to a computer to log in,\nI don't just put in my password.\n\n147\n00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,410\nI also plug this in.\n\n148\n00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,090\nIt plugs right into the USB\nport on my computer.\n\n149\n00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,500\nHere, let me just kind of bring my\ncomputer around so you guys can see it.\n\n150\n00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,860\nI basically just take this and\nI pop it right in the USB port.\n\n151\n00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,110\nAnd you might've seen the little\nblue light flicker a bit.\n\n152\n00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,970\nWhen I go to log in, I just tap this and\nthe blue light lights up, and\n\n153\n00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,190\nit's sending my authentication\ncredentials right here from this token.\n\n154\n00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,698\nSo if somebody wants to log in as me,\nwell, I can tell them my password, and\n\n155\n00:07:47,698 --> 00:07:51,649\nthey still wouldn't be able to get\nin unless they had this token.\n\n156\n00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:55,642\nNow, this is a physical token, something\nthat I actually have to have that I bought\n\n157\n00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,165\nspecifically for\nthe purposes of authentication.\n\n158\n00:07:58,165 --> 00:07:59,865\nBut it doesn't have to be like that.\n\n159\n00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:02,360\nIt could be something that you use For\nother things.\n\n160\n00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,110\nSo for example I've got my cell phone,\nand I use a little program on here.\n\n161\n00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,010\nLet me just pull it up here real quick.\n\n162\n00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,450\nA little program called\nthe Google Authenticator, and\n\n163\n00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,300\nwhat it does is it displays\ncodes on my screen.\n\n164\n00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,130\nSo 700753, that's my code right now.\n\n165\n00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,890\nAnd you might notice this little kind\nof pie over here that's getting smaller\n\n166\n00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:23,890\nand smaller.\n\n167\n00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,120\nEvery 30 seconds that code changes.\n\n168\n00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,050\nAnd if I go to log in on a system,\nI can provide my username and\n\n169\n00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,640\nthen it's gonna ask for my code and I have\nto put in whatever code is on my phone.\n\n170\n00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640\nAnd see, it's about to change right now.\n\n171\n00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,610\nAnd there it goes, it just changed.\n\n172\n00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,850\nAnd so in this scenario I've got\na physical token right here.\n\n173\n00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:45,930\nYou've got to have my phone in\norder to log in as me, right?\n\n174\n00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,970\nSomething you have makes\nit a lot more difficult for\n\n175\n00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,000\nsomebody to pretend that they're you.\n\n176\n00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,590\n>> It is, and so\nthis is becoming more and more common.\n\n177\n00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,150\nWe're gonna come back to that concept\nof multi-factor authentication,\n\n178\n00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,740\nkind of combining some of\nthose methods together.\n\n179\n00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,490\nBut something you have, has its ups and\nits downsides, right, Don?\n\n180\n00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,630\nI mean, something you have makes\nit a little more difficult.\n\n181\n00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,970\nThey can't guess, as Don was saying,\nthey can't just guess my password.\n\n182\n00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,770\nIf they find it written down or something\nlike that, I would have to have Don's\n\n183\n00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:17,000\nphone or that little UbiKey to be able\nto access or authenticate as Don.\n\n184\n00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,020\nThe downside is that some businesses\nfind though, is that well,\n\n185\n00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,970\nlet's say we issue everybody one of those.\n\n186\n00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,240\nAnd then Don comes to work and\nhe's left his at home, right?\n\n187\n00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,070\nNow how does he go about getting in?\n\n188\n00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,270\nThe military has gone to\na common access card system.\n\n189\n00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,340\nAnd again it's one of those things\nwhere now I've got to have something in\n\n190\n00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,630\nplace just in case they forget\ntheir their physical device,\n\n191\n00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,140\nthe thing that they\nhave to have with them.\n\n192\n00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,040\nSo, there's a little bit of\na downside to that, but when\n\n193\n00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,180\nwe start combining these we can get into\nsome really strong authentication methods.\n\n194\n00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,550\nSo something you have,\nlike Don showed you, that little key that\n\n195\n00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:54,250\nyou can plug inside a computer or the\nphone with an application running on it.\n\n196\n00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,460\nThird big category,\n\n197\n00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:00,010\nwhen it comes to authentication, is going\nto be something you are, all right?\n\n198\n00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:04,240\nAnd this is the new and\ngrowing authentication method.\n\n199\n00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,890\nThis is basically biometrics, right?\n\n200\n00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,540\nWe're talking about trying to\nauthenticate you based on who you are,\n\n201\n00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,170\nand there's several different\nmethods that we can use.\n\n202\n00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,880\nYou've seen them in movies,\nsome of them seem a little bit futuristic.\n\n203\n00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,470\nIt's Star Trek coming to life.\n\n204\n00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,840\nBut fingerprint scanners\nare gonna be one of them.\n\n205\n00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,102\nRetina scanners,\niris scanners, voice print,\n\n206\n00:10:25,102 --> 00:10:26,520\nI mean, the list just goes on and on.\n\n207\n00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,080\nAnd they're all looking at\nbased on on who you are.\n\n208\n00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,200\nSo let's talk about each\none of those a little bit.\n\n209\n00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,030\n>> Sure.\n>> Fingerprint scanners,\n\n210\n00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,950\npretty straightforward.\n\n211\n00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,320\nWe're talking about\nscanning your fingerprint.\n\n212\n00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,720\nDifferent types of devices,\n\n213\n00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,580\nin fact I think I have an image\nof one here that we can pull up.\n\n214\n00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,745\nAnd this is just a timeclock where\na business can come in and go,\n\n215\n00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,077\nthis is their timeclock.\n\n216\n00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:48,471\nAnd when you come in, we run one here.\n\n217\n00:10:48,471 --> 00:10:52,566\nAnd when we come into work, we stick our\nfinger in this little receptacle here, and\n\n218\n00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:55,350\nit takes a picture of\nthe underside of my finger.\n\n219\n00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,640\nNow, when we when we\nfirst set up the clock,\n\n220\n00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,990\nwe had to enroll everybody, which meant\nI have all my employees come through,\n\n221\n00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,190\nstick their finger in there,\ntake a picture.\n\n222\n00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,900\nIn fact,\ntake several pictures of their fingers.\n\n223\n00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,970\nThose get stored in a little database.\n\n224\n00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,380\nAnd now when those employees come\ninto work or when they leave for\n\n225\n00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,230\nlunch, they place their finger on\nthe scanner, it scans it and it looks for\n\n226\n00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,050\na match, and knows who it is.\n\n227\n00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,750\nAnd it can record the time that\nthey came in or that they left.\n\n228\n00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,840\nAnd that's going to be something that's\nvery difficult to fake right now,\n\n229\n00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,150\nbecause it's based on who you are.\n\n230\n00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,280\nSo unless somebody is gonna,\nI'm not gonna borrow Don's finger so\n\n231\n00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,550\nI can log in as him,\nor anything like that.\n\n232\n00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,530\nAnd we can use these for\naccessing to the computer system as well.\n\n233\n00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,640\nAnd we've got,\nthis is an example of a timeclock, but\n\n234\n00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,480\nyou can have devices that are plugged\nin via USB to your computer.\n\n235\n00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,020\nYou iPhone users out there,\n\n236\n00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,570\nyou've got the fingerprint scanner\nbuilt into your Home button now.\n\n237\n00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,910\nSo the technology is getting less and\nless expensive to implement.\n\n238\n00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,220\nSo it is becoming a lot more common.\n\n239\n00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,090\n>> Yeah, and you mentioned the iPhone.\n\n240\n00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,540\nThat really was one of the things\nthat made this technology so popular.\n\n241\n00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,780\nUp until that point, you saw expensive\ntimeclock type systems for companies.\n\n242\n00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,068\nYou saw laptops where they'd have a\nfingerprint scanner built into the laptop,\n\n243\n00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:08,817\nbut I mean you couldn't really add one on.\n\n244\n00:12:08,817 --> 00:12:11,125\nSo they were somewhat\nof a fringe technology.\n\n245\n00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:14,530\nBut companies like Apple and Samsung,\nthey include them in their phones, and\n\n246\n00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,280\nit's it's another one that I use myself.\n\n247\n00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,800\nSo, this is my phone.\n\n248\n00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,269\nAnd it used to be that if I\nwas getting a phone call and\n\n249\n00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:25,327\nhad to turn on the phone,\nI had to punch in a four digit code.\n\n250\n00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,743\nAnd a lot of people didn't\nlike to put in a PIN number,\n\n251\n00:12:27,743 --> 00:12:31,690\nbecause they knew how long it would delay\nthem answering the phone or whatever.\n\n252\n00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,220\nAnd so people wouldn't do it.\n\n253\n00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,870\nThey'd leave their phones unsecured.\n\n254\n00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,840\nBut now with companies like Samsung and\nApple putting fingerprint scanners on,\n\n255\n00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,920\nif I want to answer the phone,\nI just hit my little home button and\n\n256\n00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,170\nhold my finger there and\nit unlocks and that's it.\n\n257\n00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:49,800\nNow it actually scanned my fingerprint,\nsaw that I was me and unlocked the phone.\n\n258\n00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,190\nIf somebody else tried to do it,\nwell it's not gonna unlock is it?\n\n259\n00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:57,067\nIt's just gonna see that and say, you\nknow you're not who you say you are, and\n\n260\n00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,190\nthat's it, it doesn't let him in.\n\n261\n00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,765\nSo that's part of who I am right?\n\n262\n00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:02,625\nSomething I am.\n\n263\n00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:05,055\n>> And that's simple, right,\nI don't have to remember a password.\n\n264\n00:13:05,055 --> 00:13:08,535\nI don't have to worry about making\na 20-character password and\n\n265\n00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:10,605\nchanging it every 30 days or\nanything like that.\n\n266\n00:13:10,605 --> 00:13:13,225\nI've got my fingers with\nme most of the time.\n\n267\n00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,460\nSo I just have to reach in there and\nscan my finger.\n\n268\n00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,150\nNow like the iPhone,\nI think, Samsung as well.\n\n269\n00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,130\nYou can now tie that into your purchase\nsystem, where all I have to do is,\n\n270\n00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,250\ninstead of typing in a PIN,\nI just hold my finger there, and\n\n271\n00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,070\nit'll approve the purchase from\nthe store or something like that.\n\n272\n00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,180\nSo making it very, very easy and\n\n273\n00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,870\nstill more secure than\nmost of the other methods.\n\n274\n00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:35,900\nIt's not like I can share my\nfingerprint with somebody.\n\n275\n00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,650\nSure, we've seen the spy movies where\nsomebody takes a glass you were\n\n276\n00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,700\ndrinking from and gets a copy of your\nfingerprint or something like that.\n\n277\n00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,990\nBut in the end most of those\nare a little far-fetched.\n\n278\n00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,052\nA lot of these fingerprint scanners\nare getting better and better.\n\n279\n00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:52,637\nI'm not saying they can't be done but\nthey're getting better at checking for\n\n280\n00:13:52,637 --> 00:13:55,045\nthings like heat to make\nsure it's a living finger.\n\n281\n00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:58,641\nOr even looking for motion cuz they can\nsee the blood in the capillaries and\n\n282\n00:13:58,641 --> 00:13:59,570\nthings like that.\n\n283\n00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:03,370\nSo they're getting better and more secure,\nand fingerprints aren't the only one.\n\n284\n00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,520\nThere's other methods we can use\nwhen it comes to biometrics.\n\n285\n00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,480\nI mentioned retina scanners.\n\n286\n00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,290\nWe're talking about a camera\nthat's going to look at your eye,\n\n287\n00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,250\nand it can pick up the blood vessel\npattern on the backside of your eyeball.\n\n288\n00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,410\nThat's your retina back there,\n\n289\n00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,060\nand supposedly it's just\nas unique as a fingerprint.\n\n290\n00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,850\nThat's one method.\n\n291\n00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,770\nThat would mean we'd have\nto have cameras there, so\n\n292\n00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:26,090\nyou can see the increased cost\nin mounting cameras everywhere.\n\n293\n00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:30,200\nBut you'll see these in a lot of\nreally high security entranceways and\n\n294\n00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,510\nnot so common as a authentication method\nto a computer or a desktop or a phone.\n\n295\n00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,175\nBut in entryways to secure,\nfacilities can use retina.\n\n296\n00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:42,125\nThere's also iris and voice print,\nsome really cool ones, Don,\n\n297\n00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,925\nthat they're coming out with now.\n\n298\n00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:47,205\nThese capillaries, where they're\nlooking at the blood vessel patterns\n\n299\n00:14:47,205 --> 00:14:49,005\nunderneath your skin in your hand.\n\n300\n00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:51,100\nAgain, the really cool\nthing about biometrics,\n\n301\n00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,600\nI don't have to remember anything.\n\n302\n00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,820\nIt's who I am.\n\n303\n00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,760\nAnd it's going to be very difficult for\nsomebody to break that authentication\n\n304\n00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,640\nwithout borrowing parts of my body or\nsomething like that, so a lot more secure.\n\n305\n00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,720\nIt's just the equipment.\n\n306\n00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,250\nThe cost is slowly getting in\nreach of most of our businesses.\n\n307\n00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,280\nAll right, so we got three big factors,\nwe're talking about authentication.\n\n308\n00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,568\nWe've got the something you know,\nsomething you have, and\n\n309\n00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:17,581\nthen something you are, all right?\n\n310\n00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:22,040\nNow, each one of those on its own\nhas its strengths and weaknesses.\n\n311\n00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,840\nBut what we're seeing nowadays is we're\nstarting to combine these methods,\n\n312\n00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,550\nuse more than one.\n\n313\n00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,500\nAnd this is a concept known as\nmultifactor authentication, right?\n\n314\n00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,270\nAnd that's all, it's as simple as that.\n\n315\n00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,720\nWe're gonna use more\nthan one of those factors\n\n316\n00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,480\nwhen it comes to\nauthenticating who you are.\n\n317\n00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,490\nAs simple as, I mentioned smart cards or\nthe common access cards in the military.\n\n318\n00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,100\nThat's actually, it is a token,\nor it's a physical thing.\n\n319\n00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,843\nSo it is based on something you have, but\n\n320\n00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:53,120\nwhen you put that CAC in the reader,\nyou swipe your smart card,\n\n321\n00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,415\nyou typically have to have a password or\na PIN that goes with it.\n\n322\n00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,850\nThat's something you know.\n\n323\n00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,185\nSo now I'm talking about two\nfactors of authentication, right?\n\n324\n00:16:01,185 --> 00:16:03,320\nI've got the card, something I have.\n\n325\n00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,360\nThe PIN is something I know.\n\n326\n00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,750\nSo if I leave my card laying somewhere,\nsomebody could pick that up.\n\n327\n00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,520\nThey've got my card.\n\n328\n00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,700\nBut that's only half the battle.\n\n329\n00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,940\nThey don't know my PIN.\n\n330\n00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,650\nIf I was silly and wrote my PIN down\nsomewhere, or somebody guessed my PIN,\n\n331\n00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:21,190\nthey don't have the card, so they're\nnot gonna be able to authenticate me.\n\n332\n00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:26,030\nSo combining more than one method is what\nwe talk about multi-factor authentication.\n\n333\n00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:28,240\n>> And now be careful,\nthere is a misconception out there.\n\n334\n00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,170\nA lot of people will look at user name and\npassword and\n\n335\n00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,790\nthink of that as multi-factor,\nand it really isn't.\n\n336\n00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,700\nNow you might say well,\nwait a minute, Don.\n\n337\n00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,580\nIt's two things I have to know.\n\n338\n00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,240\nI have to know my username, and\nI have to know my password.\n\n339\n00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,070\nBut the problem here is\nthere's an assumption that\n\n340\n00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,020\nyour password is private and secret,\nand you're the only one that knows it.\n\n341\n00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,430\nAnd there's an assumption\nthat your username is public,\n\n342\n00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,660\nthat people do know your username.\n\n343\n00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,560\nFor example,\nif I'm browsing on a file system, and\n\n344\n00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,380\nI come across some files that\nare assigned Mike's account,\n\n345\n00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,660\nit'll actually say that right in there\nthat it's assigned to M Roderick.\n\n346\n00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,910\nOr if I walk up to his computer,\n\n347\n00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,150\nyou actually noticed it in his example\nearlier, it already said Mike on it.\n\n348\n00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,720\nIt already had the username.\n\n349\n00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,260\nSo username is not a secure piece of\ninformation, and it's not something even\n\n350\n00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,300\nworth keeping secret because there's so\nmany ways to gain access to it.\n\n351\n00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,390\nSo a password is just one thing.\n\n352\n00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,440\n>> Yeah, and typically when we\ntalk about multi-factoring,\n\n353\n00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,160\neach one of those was a factor, right?\n\n354\n00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,340\nSomething you know,\nsomething you have, something you are.\n\n355\n00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,540\nSo even if I had an authentication\nsystem that used a PIN and\n\n356\n00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,730\na password or something crazy like that,\nthat wouldn't be considered multi-factor\n\n357\n00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,310\nbecause you're still only\nusing one factor right?\n\n358\n00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,360\nSomething you know.\n\n359\n00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,960\nSo it needs to pull one from each one or\nnot one from each, we can do two factor,\n\n360\n00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,160\nwe can do three factor.\n\n361\n00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,040\nBut they really do need to\ncome from different factors,\n\n362\n00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,920\nthat's the whole key to the security.\n\n363\n00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,320\nIf I'm using a card and a fob,\nboth of those are something I have.\n\n364\n00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,520\nIf I leave my key chain and my wallet\nlaying there somebody now has my card and\n\n365\n00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,010\nmy fob, right?\n\n366\n00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,080\nBasing it on something I know and\nsomething I have,\n\n367\n00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,050\nnow hopefully they won't get both parts.\n\n368\n00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,200\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n369\n00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,910\nYou see multi factor needs to be the two\ndifferent methods of authentication,\n\n370\n00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,420\nas far as those categories go.\n\n371\n00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,550\n>> And then Don, I thought you\nhad an example of, oh, actually,\n\n372\n00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,790\nwe already showed you, didn't we?\n\n373\n00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,630\nWe took a peek at that.\n\n374\n00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,510\n>> Well, I showed the token.\n\n375\n00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,375\nI didn't actually use it.\n\n376\n00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,950\nSo let me give you guys an example\nof what this looks like in action.\n\n377\n00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,490\nI use this in my Google account.\n\n378\n00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,100\nMy Google account is very important to me.\n\n379\n00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,780\nIt's where a lot of my data is, so\nkeeping it secure is important.\n\n380\n00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,550\nSo I actually use a combination\nof these methods,\n\n381\n00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,460\nbecause I never know\nwhat I'm going to forget.\n\n382\n00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,080\nSo here's the Google login page.\n\n383\n00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,620\nNow I'm using Chrome's incognito window\nto make sure I'm not logged in anyway.\n\n384\n00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,870\nAnd if I wanna come in here and log in,\nI'll log in with one of my accounts.\n\n385\n00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,600\nAnd notice what my browser did there,\nsee how it remembered my password?\n\n386\n00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,140\nWell it's kind of funny cuz mine always\nremembers the wrong password, or\n\n387\n00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,530\nremember some old password of mine.\n\n388\n00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:52,000\nBut even if it remembered the right\npassword, if that was all I had and\n\n389\n00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,200\nI left my computer unlocked,\nsomebody could come up and\n\n390\n00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,330\nlog into me because they just had\naccess to my password, right?\n\n391\n00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,620\nSo browsers remembering things,\nthat's that's a problem.\n\n392\n00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,230\nFortunately for me, that's the wrong\npassword anyway, so I'll go ahead and\n\n393\n00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:06,630\npunch in the right one, and\nwhen I go to sign in, that's not enough.\n\n394\n00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,930\nNow I get my two step verification.\n\n395\n00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,380\nIt's saying, you need something else!\n\n396\n00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,420\nInsert your security key.\n\n397\n00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,300\nGoogle knows that I also\nhave a security key.\n\n398\n00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,760\nI set it up with them.\n\n399\n00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,170\nSo I need to provide this,\nbut if I lose this,\n\n400\n00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,260\nif I don't have it, I'm got some recourse.\n\n401\n00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,000\nDown here,\nI can use a verification code instead.\n\n402\n00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,720\nWell, remember when I showed my\nphone earlier in the series, and\n\n403\n00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,490\nI had the phone, the numbers\nwere changing every 30 seconds?\n\n404\n00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,370\nThat's the code, I can punch that in.\n\n405\n00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,140\nOr it could even send you like\na text message with a code.\n\n406\n00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,810\nSo you've gotta have that phone.\n\n407\n00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,147\nHere it was waiting too long.\n\n408\n00:19:38,147 --> 00:19:39,300\nI was jabbering too much.\n\n409\n00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,360\nI'm gonna hit retry.\n\n410\n00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,820\nI'm gonna put in my little USB token,\nand I'm gonna push that button on there.\n\n411\n00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,260\nAnd it's sending an authentication stream\nto Google Chrome, and now I'm logged in.\n\n412\n00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,380\nNow it knows that it's me,\nbecause I provided my password and\n\n413\n00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,390\nmy physical token.\n\n414\n00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,290\nI had the two pieces.\n\n415\n00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,560\nI could take my token out now.\n\n416\n00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,510\nThat's done.\n\n417\n00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,630\nBecause now I've authenticated,\nand I'm in the system.\n\n418\n00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,710\nBut if I go and log out, so\nI'll just go and sign out of that.\n\n419\n00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,040\nNow I'm logged out, and if somebody\ncomes back here and tries to log in.\n\n420\n00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,690\nMaybe they're running a key logger on my\nsystem, and it recorded my keystrokes, or\n\n421\n00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,110\nthey had a camera pointed down at the\ncomputer and saw what keys I pushed for\n\n422\n00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,220\nmy password.\n\n423\n00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,870\nAnd so,\nthey've got my password now, right?\n\n424\n00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:23,910\nWell, they've only got one of my factors,\nand\n\n425\n00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,380\nnow they need the other\nfactor to be able to get in.\n\n426\n00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,090\nAnd when they go to sign in\nthey'll have to provide that.\n\n427\n00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,830\n>> Yeah, that's fantastic.\n\n428\n00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:36,050\nAnd that's given us a much more\nsecure authentication method.\n\n429\n00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,640\nAs Don just showed you, without that fob,\neven if I stole his laptop, and\n\n430\n00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,380\nhe left himself logged in, I'm not getting\naccess to his Google account because\n\n431\n00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,680\nI don't have that key to\ngenerate the proper code.\n\n432\n00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,940\n>> Yeah, and this time I'm telling it,\nI'm gonna go and\n\n433\n00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,330\nuse a verification code instead.\n\n434\n00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,670\nAnd so on my phone I'm going to\nfire up my Google authenticator app\n\n435\n00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,140\nto get whatever the current code is.\n\n436\n00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,090\nAnd I've only got a few\nseconds to type this.\n\n437\n00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,310\nI should probably just wait for\nthe next code.\n\n438\n00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,510\nBut I'll punch in that current code right\nthere, and then I'll go in and verify it.\n\n439\n00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,600\nI can remember the computer for 30 days.\n\n440\n00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,120\nI'm not going to do that.\n\n441\n00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,900\nIf this is my computer,\n\n442\n00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,330\nI know I'm gonna have it with me,\nI might want to say remember for 30 days.\n\n443\n00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:14,450\nBut if it's a public one,\nI can just punch that in and here we go.\n\n444\n00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:17,220\nRight, I'm logged in now\nusing the code from my phone.\n\n445\n00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,520\nSo I've got a few different options, and\n\n446\n00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,050\nthe reason I do that is maybe I don't\nhave one available to me one day.\n\n447\n00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,600\nThis little token,\nI keep this on my key chain, right?\n\n448\n00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,410\nMy key chain has my car keys, and so I'm\nnot going anywhere without my car keys.\n\n449\n00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:33,170\nSo I pretty much always\nhave this token with me.\n\n450\n00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,930\nBut I also almost always\nhave my cell phone with me.\n\n451\n00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:40,900\nSo I know as long as I've got one of these\nI can get in there and do what I need.\n\n452\n00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,110\nIf I lose one, I still have the other.\n\n453\n00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,890\nThat's kind of my backup.\n\n454\n00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,240\nBut whenever I log in,\nit's always multi-factor.\n\n455\n00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,480\nIt's always my password plus one\nof these two devices right here.\n\n456\n00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,620\n>> Exactly, and that gives us that much\nmore secure authentication method.\n\n457\n00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,460\nAnd in the end, I think, Don, we're gonna\nsee a lot more of these in the corporate\n\n458\n00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,550\nenvironment, because most\npeople have smartphones.\n\n459\n00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,240\nSo we've got that capability.\n\n460\n00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,910\nThose little keys are getting much less\nexpensive to manufacture which means\n\n461\n00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,090\nbusinesses can afford to buy them for\nall their employees.\n\n462\n00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:17,030\nSo it's becoming more common, and it's so\nmuch more secure than just a straight\n\n463\n00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:21,150\nup password, because you and I both know,\nwe hate to change our password.\n\n464\n00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,650\nWe don't come up with strong\npasswords all the time.\n\n465\n00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,060\nWe reuse our passwords for\ndifferent accounts,\n\n466\n00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:31,200\nand all of those are very,\nthey're big weaknesses in that system.\n\n467\n00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,370\nBy using this multi-factor\nauthentication method,\n\n468\n00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:37,050\nit really does improve the authentication\nstrength of your systems.\n\n469\n00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:37,630\nYeah.\n\n470\n00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:42,050\n>> Now, don't use these as a crutch\nto abandon good password practices.\n\n471\n00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,180\nWe're gonna have an episode coming\nup covering password policies and\n\n472\n00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,360\nthe way to choose a strong password.\n\n473\n00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,980\nJust because you have an authentication\ntoken doesn't mean you should just use\n\n474\n00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,480\na password of password123, right?\n\n475\n00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,820\nBecause the weaker that is,\nif somebody does get your token,\n\n476\n00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,070\nthey could potentially\nguess your password.\n\n477\n00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:02,290\nAnother thing is, there was an article\na few months ago about a writer for\n\n478\n00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,900\na newspaper up in the Northeast US, and\n\n479\n00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,240\nhe had just enabled dual factor\nauthentication for Twitter.\n\n480\n00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,033\nSo he had where he would log in with his\npassword, and whenever he logged in,\n\n481\n00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:15,649\nit would send a message to his cell phone,\na text message with a code, and\n\n482\n00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:17,519\nhe would punch in that code to log in.\n\n483\n00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:18,450\nSo again, you had to have two things.\n\n484\n00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:21,620\nYou had to have his cell phone, and\nyou had to have his password to get in.\n\n485\n00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,840\nAnd he was a little cocky about it.\n\n486\n00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,910\nHe published this article in the paper,\nand he said I am so\n\n487\n00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:29,910\nconfident in the security of this system,\nthat I'll post my password right here.\n\n488\n00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,190\nAnd that's what he did, in this article,\nright there in the newspaper,\n\n489\n00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,350\nhe put his password.\n\n490\n00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:37,320\nBecause he knew nobody could log in\nunless they had his cell phone also.\n\n491\n00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,500\nWell, you know what?\n\n492\n00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,970\nPeople tried, lots of people tried.\n\n493\n00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:45,590\nAnd as a result, he was getting thousands\nof text messages on his phone per hour.\n\n494\n00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,050\nHe couldn't use his phone.\n\n495\n00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,470\nAnd so it pretty much did a,\nwhat they call, a denial of service.\n\n496\n00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:55,420\nAnd so he did a follow up article later\non saying, while on one hand nobody did\n\n497\n00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,282\nget into his Twitter account,\nthat was a really dumb thing to do.\n\n498\n00:23:59,282 --> 00:24:01,300\n[LAUGH] Then he wouldn't\ndo it that way again.\n\n499\n00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,080\nSo just be aware that\nnothing is fool proof.\n\n500\n00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,580\nYou still need to be guarded\nabout your information.\n\n501\n00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,500\nAnd when you're dealing\nwith something you have,\n\n502\n00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,220\nmake sure you don't lose it,\nit's important.\n\n503\n00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,025\n>> It really is.\n\n504\n00:24:12,025 --> 00:24:15,070\n[LAUGH] That's kind of a funny story.\n\n505\n00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,490\nSo again,\nwhen we when we boil down authentication,\n\n506\n00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,660\nverifying the identity of someone or\nsomething.\n\n507\n00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,070\nGot several different methods that we\ncan base these authentication on or\n\n508\n00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,370\nbase the authentication on,\nseveral different factors.\n\n509\n00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:31,970\nYou've got something you have,\nsomething you know, and something you are.\n\n510\n00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,460\nWe can use those individually,\nlike something you know or\n\n511\n00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,260\nusing a password that we're\nused to using all the time.\n\n512\n00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,690\nWe can do something you have\nlike a key fob or a smart card.\n\n513\n00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:45,310\nWe can do something you are,\nfinger prints, retina, voice prints,\n\n514\n00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,490\nthings like that.\n\n515\n00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,600\nAll individual factors, or\nwe could do multi-factor.\n\n516\n00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,710\nWe can do two factor.\n\n517\n00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,000\nWe can do three factor, or\nas many factors as we need.\n\n518\n00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,798\nWe can do multifactor authentication.\n\n519\n00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,240\nOkay, so it just means we're gonna\ncombine more than one method\n\n520\n00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,050\nto increase the strength of\nthe authentication method we're using.\n\n521\n00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,680\nAll right, well Mike, I think that's a\npretty good wrap up of the different ways\n\n522\n00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,820\nauthentic it out there.\n\n523\n00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,480\nKeep in mind there's new ones coming\nout all the time, so stay on top of it.\n\n524\n00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,750\nBut just follow proper practices,\ntake precautions,\n\n525\n00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,420\nmake sure you keep your data safe, and\nit will definitely come in handy, so.\n\n526\n00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,351\nAll right well that's about it for\nthis episode so signing off for ITProTV,\n\n527\n00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:21,220\nI'm Don Pezet.\n\n528\n00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,100\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n529\n00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,600\n>> And we will see you next time.\n\n530\n00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,860\n[SOUND]\n\n",

another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,920\nI'll be your host Daniel Lowrie, and\nhere with me today Is Mike Roderick.\n\n5\n00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,720\nHow you doing, Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,510\n>> I'm doing fantastic, Dan,\nand how you doing today?\n\n7\n00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,710\n>> Oh man, I can't complain.\n\n8\n00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,100\nI really am gonna enjoy the show, I think.\n\n9\n00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,490\nIt's about security,\nspecifically password policies, right?\n\n10\n00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,780\nWe need to have passwords.\n\n11\n00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,470\nIt's something that's basically\npart of our life anymore.\n\n12\n00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,060\n>> It really is.\n\n13\n00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,940\nI mean, everything we do seems requires\na password, and a lot of people\n\n14\n00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,950\ndon't have a good understanding\nof what makes a good password,\n\n15\n00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,330\nwhat makes a strong password,\nwe've heard that term, right?\n\n16\n00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,560\nYou need to use a strong password.\n\n17\n00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,470\nDoes that mean I have the word\nstrong somewhere in my password?\n\n18\n00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,360\nThis is what a lot of people don't\nunderstand, and as you guys out there,\n\n19\n00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,060\nsome of you are IT geeks like us,\nyou're going like yeah, whatever.\n\n20\n00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,130\nBut honestly people don't understand that,\nmy parents and\n\n21\n00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,900\npeople that don't use computers\nevery day as a part of their living,\n\n22\n00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,860\nor something like that,\nmight not have an understanding.\n\n23\n00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,380\nAnd it's a very important\npart of security.\n\n24\n00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,190\nIt really is, our first line\nof defense is that password.\n\n25\n00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,830\nAnd so I think I would like to start\noff talking with is just why do we have\n\n26\n00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:12,600\npasswords?\n\n27\n00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,230\nAnd the first reason, how many of you\nout there at home, raise your hand.\n\n28\n00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,160\nIf you guys are watching live,\njump in that chat room.\n\n29\n00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,300\nIf you're watching a recording,\nthink about this.\n\n30\n00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,900\nDanny, you can answer,\n\n31\n00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,470\nhow many of you have a computer at\nhome that the family uses, right?\n\n32\n00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,620\nThat family machine that sits in the den\nor the study or something like that.\n\n33\n00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,910\nAnd there is no password on there, right?\n\n34\n00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,240\nEverybody just walks up to it,\nit's always on.\n\n35\n00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,270\nAnybody can use it or what have you.\n\n36\n00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,565\n>> Oh yeah, we totally have that, we call\nit the the living room laptop, right?\n\n37\n00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:41,500\n[LAUGH]\n>> The living room laptop, there you go.\n\n38\n00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,970\nThis is a very common thing, and\n\n39\n00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,090\nin a home environment,\nit's not that big of a deal, right?\n\n40\n00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:50,320\nIt's convenient, I don't have anything\nthat I need to keep secret maybe from\n\n41\n00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,790\nthe other people in my family,\nor things like that, but\n\n42\n00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,680\nin a corporate environment\nthat's not gonna fly.\n\n43\n00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,630\nWithout an account,\n\n44\n00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,840\nif everybody doesn't have their own\naccount, I have no accountability.\n\n45\n00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,100\nAnd so I need everybody to have their\nown account that they use, and that way,\n\n46\n00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,430\nI can control what resources they\naccess and what they can't access.\n\n47\n00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:13,110\nIf you don't have your own account,\nthen I can't say you can access this or\n\n48\n00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,900\nyou can't access that.\n\n49\n00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,740\nAnd along with that account\nthen comes that password.\n\n50\n00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,190\nWe need some way,\nhow do I verify who it is?\n\n51\n00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,360\nMake sure that hey, are you the person\nthat's supposed to use this account.\n\n52\n00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,250\nBecause if I can log on as you,\n\n53\n00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,370\nthen everything that I do is\ngoing to be tracked back to you.\n\n54\n00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,950\n>> Yeah.\n>> I can access whatever you can\n\n55\n00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,790\naccess, right?\n\n56\n00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,520\nI get whatever permissions you have,\nI would then have,\n\n57\n00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,260\ncuz the computer has no way of knowing.\n\n58\n00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,640\nSo the password's a very\nimportant part of security.\n\n59\n00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,460\nNow when it comes to making\na strong password, I think that's,\n\n60\n00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,280\nthe first thing we've gotta understand\nis what makes a good strong password?\n\n61\n00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,500\nAnd there's lots of,\nnow you've probably seen news articles or\n\n62\n00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,140\nread articles in the paper and things like\nthis about what makes a strong password.\n\n63\n00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,240\nAnd we're gonna kind of boil it down for\nyou here.\n\n64\n00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,447\n>> I make my password go to the gym.\n\n65\n00:02:58,447 --> 00:02:59,988\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Make it strong.\n\n66\n00:02:59,988 --> 00:03:03,935\n>> My password can bench 350 [NOISE].\n\n67\n00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:07,430\nBut no, a strong password, a password\nis just a series of characters, right?\n\n68\n00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,980\nIt's made up of letters or\nnumbers or special characters.\n\n69\n00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,000\nIn fact,\nthat's a point I'm gonna come back to.\n\n70\n00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,210\nBut it is just a string of characters.\n\n71\n00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,910\nAnd there's a few different things\nwe can do to improve the strength\n\n72\n00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,630\nof our password.\n\n73\n00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,490\nA couple of big ones are gonna\nbe length and complexity.\n\n74\n00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,950\nAnd let's start with length.\n\n75\n00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,090\nYeah that's a pretty easy one I think for\neverybody to understand.\n\n76\n00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:33,030\nThe longer the password is the stronger\nthat password is going to be.\n\n77\n00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,600\nAnd the reason that is, is because these\npassword cracking utilities, the people\n\n78\n00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,180\nthat are trying to get your password,\nthey don't know what your password is.\n\n79\n00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:46,100\nSo the more characters that you have,\nthe more possibilities there are, right?\n\n80\n00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,220\nIf you only have a two character password,\n\n81\n00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,895\nhow many possibilities\ncan you come up with?\n\n82\n00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:52,078\nAA, AB, AC, right?\n\n83\n00:03:52,078 --> 00:03:54,370\nIf we have a ten character password,\n\n84\n00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:00,370\na whole lot more possibilities Which means\nthe bad guy has a lot more guessing to do.\n\n85\n00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,960\nRight?\nHe'll have more possibilities there.\n\n86\n00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,380\nAnd that ties right into\nwhat we call complexity.\n\n87\n00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,900\nComplexity is how complex is the password.\n\n88\n00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,260\nIn other words,\nwhat is the password made up of?\n\n89\n00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,650\nWhen we look at passwords,\n\n90\n00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,420\nthere's really four character sets\nthat we can use in a password.\n\n91\n00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:22,752\nThere's upper case letters, lowercase\nletters, numbers and special characters.\n\n92\n00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:26,015\nAnd if we pull up my screen for a second\nhere, I got a little chart broken out.\n\n93\n00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,060\nI think it'll help us visualize this.\n\n94\n00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,970\nThere are 26 in the English language, for\nexample, there's 26 uppercase letters.\n\n95\n00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,200\nThere's 26 lowercase letters.\n\n96\n00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,470\nThere's ten numbers,and there's\nabout 32 or so special characters,\n\n97\n00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:44,310\ngiving us a total of 94\npossibilities per character.\n\n98\n00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,880\nAnd I've got a little formula over here,\nand don't worry,\n\n99\n00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,700\nthere's no quiz at the end, but\n\n100\n00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,230\nit's a little formula that those of you\nthat are in IT might be familiar with,\n\n101\n00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,200\nhow we determine how many\nhosts I can have on a subnet.\n\n102\n00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,350\nYou take the number of bits to the\nexponent of the number of possibilities to\n\n103\n00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,554\nthe exponent of the number of bits.\n\n104\n00:05:00,554 --> 00:05:03,100\nWe're gonna do something\nvery similar here.\n\n105\n00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,700\nLet's say that I made a password\nof just uppercase letters, right?\n\n106\n00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,470\nSo the only thing in my password\nis uppercase letters, and\n\n107\n00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,320\nlet's say it's eight characters long,\nall right?\n\n108\n00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,580\nWell that means that I'm gonna\nhave something like this.\n\n109\n00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,280\nWe're gonna say eight possibilities,\nthere's eight characters, so\n\n110\n00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,280\nmy password is eight characters long.\n\n111\n00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,930\nAnd I wanna do to the exponent,\nor to the power of, 26,\n\n112\n00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,910\ncuz that's how many possibilities\nthere are per character.\n\n113\n00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,400\nSo I hit Enter here and\nlet Excel do its thing.\n\n114\n00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,710\nAnd let's format that a little bit better,\nso we can kind of see this number.\n\n115\n00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,602\nSo I'm gonna change that.\n\n116\n00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,320\nWe're gonna get rid of that\nscientific notation there.\n\n117\n00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,590\nWe'll drop up all our decimals and\nwe can see, and\n\n118\n00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:47,650\nactually let's add a separator in there\nas well, so we can make that a little bit\n\n119\n00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,330\neasier to read, and you can see that's\nquite a few possibilities right?\n\n120\n00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:52,990\n>> That's gonna take a while [LAUGH].\n\n121\n00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,120\n>> I mean, if we calculate that\nout that's what, thousands,\n\n122\n00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,620\nmillions, billions, trillions,\nand gavalgu-gazillions, right?\n\n123\n00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,670\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n124\n00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,210\n>> That's where it seems like a lot,\nright?\n\n125\n00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,150\n>> Yeah.\n\n126\n00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,350\n>> Here's the problem.\n\n127\n00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,440\nAn average desktop computer,\nthe one that you've got sitting at,\n\n128\n00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,130\nyou're sitting at right now, can do\nabout 100 million guesses per second.\n\n129\n00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,260\nPer second, and\nthat's just your standard desktop.\n\n130\n00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,130\nIf you throw in some hacker that's got a\nGPU, a couple graphic processor units that\n\n131\n00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,900\nare really good at crunching numbers,\nthey're gonna drop that, or\n\n132\n00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,970\nthey're gonna increase the number of\nguesses per second by a large amount.\n\n133\n00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,400\nIf you tie in a supercomputer,\nlet's say somebody had a bunch\n\n134\n00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,390\nof computers tied together or something\nlike that, they would drop that number,\n\n135\n00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,900\nor they would increase those number of\nguesses per second up into the billions.\n\n136\n00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,470\nSo you can see a number like this.\n\n137\n00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,320\nReally, all of a sudden it's not that big.\n\n138\n00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,190\nI mean it would not take that long for\na computer to go through that.\n\n139\n00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:55,124\nSo let's compare, what if I now\nincluded upper case and lower case?\n\n140\n00:06:56,135 --> 00:06:59,405\nNow there's 52 possibilities\nper character, right?\n\n141\n00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:01,235\nSo I'm gonna use the same length.\n\n142\n00:07:01,235 --> 00:07:05,395\nWe're gonna say that my password is 8\ncharacters long, but this time there\n\n143\n00:07:07,145 --> 00:07:10,230\nare 52 possibilities per character.\n\n144\n00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,600\nAnd we can see what a jump that made.\n\n145\n00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,510\nSo just by adding another set\nof characters to my password,\n\n146\n00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,510\nI have made my password much,\nmuch stronger.\n\n147\n00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,750\n>> And Mike,\nyou're just talking about per character.\n\n148\n00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,810\nThis isn't like your password which maybe\nsix characters or eight characters,\n\n149\n00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,130\nten characters, whatever.\n\n150\n00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,290\nThis is per character, that's how long\nit will take or that's how many guesses\n\n151\n00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,600\nthe computer would have to make before\nit actually guessed that character.\n\n152\n00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,620\n>> Exactly.\n\n153\n00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,600\nAnd now if we wanna do,\nlet's say in a Microsoft world.\n\n154\n00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,850\nIf you work in an office we're using\nWindows computers and servers, they'll\n\n155\n00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:51,190\nhave an option that says, the IT guys will\nset some option called require complexity.\n\n156\n00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,130\nWhich means you've gotta use three of\nthe four character sets in your password.\n\n157\n00:07:55,130 --> 00:08:00,126\nSo some combination of upper case,\nlower case, and numbers, or lower case and\n\n158\n00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:03,720\nnumbers and special characters,\nand things like that.\n\n159\n00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,010\nSo, and let's just say we get crazy.\n\n160\n00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,210\nLet's say we use all four character\nsets in our password, right?\n\n161\n00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,230\nWell, let's see what happens.\n\n162\n00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,300\nEight character password.\n\n163\n00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,480\nOops.\n\n164\n00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,150\nAnd we're gonna take that\nto the 94th power, and\n\n165\n00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:22,200\nI'm gonna have to make my\ncell a little bit wider.\n\n166\n00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,990\nCuz you guys,\nif I can even fit on one screen.\n\n167\n00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:31,460\nWe can see the number of possibilities\nthere has increased by a few fold.\n\n168\n00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,760\n>> Yeah, just a couple here and there.\n\n169\n00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,499\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n>> Now,\n\n170\n00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:37,686\nthe probably the person at home is sitting\nthere going okay, well that seems like\n\n171\n00:08:37,686 --> 00:08:42,181\nexcessive, right, to have all that but it\ngoes back to that being accountable right,\n\n172\n00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:45,261\nthe accountability factor is,\nI tell people all the time,\n\n173\n00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:49,446\nyou need to have a strong password because\nif someone gets a hold of your account,\n\n174\n00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,190\nand they do something malicious,\nit's under you.\n\n175\n00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,700\nYou would have to prove\nthat it wasn't you.\n\n176\n00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,200\nSo just using a strong\npassword at that case,\n\n177\n00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,640\nit helps alleviate that as a probability,\nright?\n\n178\n00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,760\nSo it just keeps you out of being that low\nhanging fruit, and someone just going oh,\n\n179\n00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,380\nthat password is easy to crack.\n\n180\n00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,500\nNow I'm in as them, and\nI'm draining bank accounts or whatever.\n\n181\n00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,850\n>> Let's try, let's see if Excel can\nhelp us out here on this spreadsheet.\n\n182\n00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,570\nWhat I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna take this\nnumber, and I'm gonna come down here and\n\n183\n00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:24,040\nI'm gonna say, let's do a formula,\nwe'll take that number, if it'll let me.\n\n184\n00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,250\nIt doesn't like it.\n\n185\n00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,361\nBut if we try to divide\nthat by 100 million.\n\n186\n00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:35,560\nRight?\nThat's how many seconds it would take if\n\n187\n00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:44,110\nwe take that and divide that by,\nwhat, 60 seconds in a minute there.\n\n188\n00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,520\nYou can see we're down to, and\nI gotta copy that formatting down there.\n\n189\n00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,860\nWe can get rid of that\nscientific notation.\n\n190\n00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,470\nYeah, you can see where it's starting to\ndrop it down if I start dividing that out.\n\n191\n00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,690\nAnd so really, that's a good strong\npassword but it's not bulletproof.\n\n192\n00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,680\nI mean if I have enough time,\nand that's the thing.\n\n193\n00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,750\nIf the bad guy has enough time,\nhe will crack your passport, or\n\n194\n00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,850\nthat person will crack your password.\n\n195\n00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,370\nIt's just do they have enough time?\n\n196\n00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,930\nSo a couple things we can do there for\n\n197\n00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,350\nfor making a strong password is\nmaking sure it's long enough.\n\n198\n00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,720\nEight is really what most companies\nwill consider minimum length.\n\n199\n00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,460\n10 is probably better 12, 15, if you're\ndealing with sensitive information.\n\n200\n00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:30,670\nIf your account has administrative rights,\nor if you have access to sensitive\n\n201\n00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:36,040\ninformation, you should probably be\nusing a ten plus character password.\n\n202\n00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,510\nAnd it needs to be complex.\n\n203\n00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,370\nIt needs to have all those\ndifferent character sets\n\n204\n00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,500\nbecause we want all those possibilities.\n\n205\n00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,960\nMake it take that much longer for somebody\nto go through one of these utilities, and\n\n206\n00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,280\nfire off all these guesses, and\ntry to crack that password.\n\n207\n00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,470\nSo length and complexity.\n\n208\n00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,420\n>> Yeah.\n>> Now, I've got it.\n\n209\n00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,310\n>> I was gonna say.\n\n210\n00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,360\nThat's why we have password\npolicies of after 35 or 45 days,\n\n211\n00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,060\nwhatever the case is,\nyou have to change your password.\n\n212\n00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,750\n>> Exactly, and\nthat's what people have to understand.\n\n213\n00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,480\nA password doesn't have to be bulletproof,\nthere are no uncrackable passwords.\n\n214\n00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,690\nWith enough power and enough time,\nall passwords are crackable because\n\n215\n00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:14,630\nthey're just some combination of letter\nand number and special character.\n\n216\n00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,670\nSo I can guess every possible combination.\n\n217\n00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,110\nNow that might take me 100,000 years,\nright?\n\n218\n00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,140\nIf I don't have enough processing power or\nI can up the processing power and\n\n219\n00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,750\nshrink that time frame down.\n\n220\n00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,830\nSo all passwords are crackable.\n\n221\n00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,690\nBut they don't have to be bulletproof.\n\n222\n00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,640\nThey just need to pass your policy.\n\n223\n00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,502\nWhat if your company says,\nwe change our password every 30 days,\n\n224\n00:11:34,502 --> 00:11:38,656\nthen your password needs to take\nlonger than 30 days to break, right?\n\n225\n00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,457\nThat way, if the bad guy does break\nyour password by the time he gets it,\n\n226\n00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:44,120\nlet's say it takes six months\nto break your password.\n\n227\n00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,340\nBy the time he figures out your password,\nit's not your password anymore.\n\n228\n00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,410\nYou're using a new password.\n\n229\n00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,900\nYou've already changed it, right?\n\n230\n00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,710\n>> Yeah, what do they say?\n\n231\n00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,720\nI don't have to run faster than the bear.\n\n232\n00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,052\nI just have to run faster than you.\n\n233\n00:11:54,052 --> 00:11:55,070\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n234\n00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,520\nJust gotta beat the slowest one.\n\n235\n00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,530\n>> Exactly.\n\n236\n00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,040\n>> Exactly.\n\n237\n00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,480\nSo that's why we change those passwords,\nso\n\n238\n00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,690\nwe're not giving the bad guys\nforever to crack our password.\n\n239\n00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,320\nOtherwise, we'd have to use 30\ncharacter passwords, you know, or\n\n240\n00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,120\nsomething crazy like that.\n\n241\n00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,660\nAll right, so I really want to make\nsure using a good strong password,\n\n242\n00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,690\nwhich means making it long and\nmaking a complex.\n\n243\n00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,610\nYou've gotta change your password.\n\n244\n00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,240\nAnd as you said,\ncompanies put these policies in place.\n\n245\n00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,400\nThey're typically enforced by your system,\nby something called a group policy object,\n\n246\n00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,590\nbut you don't really have a choice.\n\n247\n00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:32,430\nYou have to create it so long or\nyou have to change it every so often.\n\n248\n00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,240\nAnd that's because, as users,\nwe look for the easy way out.\n\n249\n00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,730\nI mean, if I don't have to change\nmy password, I don't want to.\n\n250\n00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,680\nHow many passwords do you\nhave to remember, Dan?\n\n251\n00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,492\n>> It's three.\n\n252\n00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:41,200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It's three.\n\n253\n00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,620\nI have a weak password for\nsigning up for dumb stuff.\n\n254\n00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,460\nA semi-strong password for stuff that\nI would mind to keep secure, and\n\n255\n00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,920\nthen a very strong password for\nthings like my bank account.\n\n256\n00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,480\n>> Yes.\n\n257\n00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,940\nYep.\nAnd that's a good point there is,\n\n258\n00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,830\none of the things you'll read\nwhen you're going out there.\n\n259\n00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:01,520\nIf you do any research on this, they'll\ntalk about best practices for passwords,\n\n260\n00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,970\nand they say, don't reuse your password.\n\n261\n00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,150\nUse different passwords for\ndifferent locations.\n\n262\n00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,300\nI know a lot of people though that use\nyour strategy, that will say, all right,\n\n263\n00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,020\nI've got one password that I use for\nall those silly newsgroups.\n\n264\n00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,750\nI don't care if somebody hacks\ninto that or what have you.\n\n265\n00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:19,000\nI got a different password to use for\nmy medium security type stuff, and\n\n266\n00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,840\nthen I've got a really long\ncomplex password that I use for\n\n267\n00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,340\nmaybe my online banking,\nstuff that I really need to protect.\n\n268\n00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,970\nAnd I don't think there's\nanything wrong with that.\n\n269\n00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,790\nA lot of the security geeks out there\nmight be sending me e-mails after this or\n\n270\n00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,980\njumping in my forums, going,\n\n271\n00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,100\nhow dare you recommend that they use\nthe same password in more than one place?\n\n272\n00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,550\nWell, in the end,\n\n273\n00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:42,580\nwe can end up hurting security by\nmaking too many requirements like that.\n\n274\n00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,290\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n275\n00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,340\n>> I mean, if I tell you you've got\nto have a different password for\n\n276\n00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,480\nevery single thing,\nwhat are you gonna do, Dan?\n\n277\n00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,060\n>> I'm gonna write them down probably and\nput them on my keyboard, and\n\n278\n00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,830\nanybody with a pair of eyes is gonna\nlook at them and see what they are\n\n279\n00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,390\n>> Exactly, so we end up reducing security\n\n280\n00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,400\nby making these kind of real\nstringent rules like that.\n\n281\n00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,030\nSo I'm gonna be the one that tells\nyou it's okay to reuse some of those\n\n282\n00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,600\npasswords, as long as they're\nkind of the same category.\n\n283\n00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,440\nI'm not gonna use the password that\nI use on my bank account at that\n\n284\n00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,770\nforum on that newsgroup, because I don't\nknow what their security's like, right?\n\n285\n00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,960\nThey're just a newsgroup.\n\n286\n00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,410\nIt's something I join on the web.\n\n287\n00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,900\nThey probably have really poor,\nI'm not saying they all do, but\n\n288\n00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,020\nthey might have really poor security.\n\n289\n00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,840\nSomebody could capture that information,\nand now not only do they have the password\n\n290\n00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,440\nto my newsgroup but I've got the password\nto my bank account, and that I don't want.\n\n291\n00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,360\nSo there's some common sense\nwe gotta throw in there.\n\n292\n00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,210\nYou can reuse passwords if you\nthink about the security that those\n\n293\n00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,630\nare providing there.\n\n294\n00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,670\nAnd I'm also one of the guys\nthat'll tell you can write it down\n\n295\n00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,660\nif you do it properly, right?\n\n296\n00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:50,290\nI mean, you don't write it down and post\nit on its Post-it note on your monitor,\n\n297\n00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,630\nor tape it under your keyboard, or put\nit in your desk, or something like that.\n\n298\n00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,360\nThere's ways you can go\nabout writing it down.\n\n299\n00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,130\nIn fact,\nI can show you a couple examples here.\n\n300\n00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,680\nI've got a spreadsheet here,\nand you get, okay,\n\n301\n00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,570\nthese are three, and my work account,\nmy email account, and\n\n302\n00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,080\nmy bill pay account, and\nI just wrote some generic passwords here.\n\n303\n00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,290\nIf I'm going to write these down,\nwhat I might do is reorder these, right?\n\n304\n00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:20,130\nThis is the password for work, but\nI might put it down here, right?\n\n305\n00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:28,530\nAnd then up here,\nI put the password For bill pay.\n\n306\n00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:31,160\nSo I'm dealing when somebody\nsteals this piece of paper,\n\n307\n00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,810\nthey're going to think work\nis this password right here.\n\n308\n00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,160\nThey don't know that work is\nactually the one down here.\n\n309\n00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,490\nThe other thing I might do is throw\nsome random characters in here.\n\n310\n00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,200\nAnd I put a few in front of it.\n\n311\n00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,300\nI put a few behind it.\n\n312\n00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,390\nAnd now I'm the only one that knows\nthat only those middle characters.\n\n313\n00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,030\nMaybe I put four in front and\nfour in the back.\n\n314\n00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,320\nI'm the only one to nose\ndrop those first four and\n\n315\n00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,040\ntrailing four characters off there.\n\n316\n00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,900\nSo even if you do get this piece of paper,\nyou're not going to know.\n\n317\n00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,800\nYou can't read my password up there,\nright?\n\n318\n00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,550\n>> Now, I mean, this is simple.\n\n319\n00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,582\nObviously you think, so\n\n320\n00:16:03,582 --> 00:16:06,345\nthat we can understand the concept\nof what Mike's talking about.\n\n321\n00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:10,215\nWe're not saying use password one, or\ntry to put asdf on the front of it.\n\n322\n00:16:10,215 --> 00:16:11,375\nNot what we're saying it all.\n\n323\n00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,786\nBut what he is saying is,\nwhatever your password is,\n\n324\n00:16:13,786 --> 00:16:17,376\nadd some extra something that looks like\nit actually may go with that password,\n\n325\n00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,110\nand it's gonna throw off the hounds.\n\n326\n00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,280\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n327\n00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,838\nAnd that way, and the other thing is,\n\n328\n00:16:21,838 --> 00:16:24,145\nmake sure you keep track of\nthat piece of paper, right?\n\n329\n00:16:24,145 --> 00:16:25,685\nAgain, don't tape it to your monitor.\n\n330\n00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,600\nDon't stick it in your desk drawer.\n\n331\n00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,041\nHow many, for the gentleman,\n\n332\n00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:32,560\nhow many people can get in your\nwallet without you knowing about it?\n\n333\n00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,030\nHow many people, ladies, can get into your\npurse without you knowing about it, right?\n\n334\n00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:40,380\nThere are places I could keep this,\nand I could help keep that secure.\n\n335\n00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,210\nAnother option, Daniel would be programs.\n\n336\n00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,180\nThese password vaults that\nwe're seeing more and more of.\n\n337\n00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,442\nDo you use any of those?\n\n338\n00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:51,405\n>> Oh yeah, around here in the studios,\nLastPass is very favorable with us.\n\n339\n00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:52,325\nIt does a really good job.\n\n340\n00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:54,789\nYou just put all your passwords in there,\nand when you go to a site,\n\n341\n00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:55,940\nit fills in that information.\n\n342\n00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,600\nI don't have to remember anything.\n\n343\n00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,630\nSo it's really nice.\n\n344\n00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,490\n>> Exactly.\n\n345\n00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,910\nAnd that way you've got\none master password.\n\n346\n00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:04,644\nThese are programs, for\nthose of you that are not familiar,\n\n347\n00:17:04,644 --> 00:17:07,820\nthese are programs that keep track\nof your passwords for you, right?\n\n348\n00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,870\nThey're basically like writing\nthem down inside this program, and\n\n349\n00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:16,530\nthen you have one master password\nto access that password vault.\n\n350\n00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,675\nAnd so you can make that one really,\nreally long and strong, right?\n\n351\n00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:21,290\nCuz it's the only one\nyou have to remember.\n\n352\n00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,575\nThat's a 15 character password.\n\n353\n00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:27,229\nAnd once I log into that, then when\nI go to these different web sites,\n\n354\n00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:31,072\nit can autofill my password, or\nI can have it copy and pasted in there, or\n\n355\n00:17:31,072 --> 00:17:31,900\nwhat have you.\n\n356\n00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,600\nAnd so that's another way that\nwe can have multiple passwords,\n\n357\n00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,120\nby using different passwords\nat different locations,\n\n358\n00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,600\nstill make it easy to remember that if,\nwell cuz I really don't have to remember.\n\n359\n00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,750\nIn fact LastPass will\ngenerate passwords for\n\n360\n00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,820\nyou and\nI'm sure most of the programs will.\n\n361\n00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,930\nIt's a little unnerving, I don't know if\nyou use that option, because you have\n\n362\n00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:56,940\na master password to get in, and then you\ncan have LastPass generate passwords for\n\n363\n00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,580\nyour different websites,\nyour banking and things like that.\n\n364\n00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,580\nAnd it'll generate crazy long strong\npasswords, random characters.\n\n365\n00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,330\nBut if I ever forget that master password,\nI don't know my password for\n\n366\n00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,310\nmy bank account now, right?\n\n367\n00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,710\n>> Or if I'm on like my smart phone,\nI don't have LastPass installed on that.\n\n368\n00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,645\nI'm like, I don't remember what that was.\n\n369\n00:18:14,645 --> 00:18:16,020\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n370\n00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,130\nAnd so you do wanna be careful\nof those password vaults.\n\n371\n00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:22,715\nThey can get you in trouble\nif you rely on them too much.\n\n372\n00:18:22,715 --> 00:18:26,150\nSo, and there's other things, as far\nas coming up with a strong password.\n\n373\n00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,065\nThis is another one\nthat I get asked a lot.\n\n374\n00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,760\nHow do I come up with a strong password?\n\n375\n00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:36,380\nIt really needs to be eight characters\nplus and some of the rules, some of\n\n376\n00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,630\nthe best practices are gonna be one, never\nuse a word found in the dictionary, right?\n\n377\n00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,980\nBecause there are utilities out\nthere that these people will use\n\n378\n00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,650\nthat will go through every\nword in the dictionary.\n\n379\n00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,480\nSo if your password is one of those words,\nthen you're gonna get,\n\n380\n00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,140\nit's gonna crack it in\na matter of seconds.\n\n381\n00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,280\nSo we don't wanna use anything\nthat's found in the dictionary.\n\n382\n00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,460\nWe don't wanna use anything\nthat's personally identifiable.\n\n383\n00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,590\nOur name, our kids' names,\nour anniversaries, and\n\n384\n00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,840\nthings like that, because it's\nreal easy to get that information.\n\n385\n00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,670\nI can find it on websites.\n\n386\n00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,282\nI can just come talk to you and\nstart talking about my dog and\n\n387\n00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:12,640\nyou tell me about your dog and all of\nthe sudden I've got your dog's name and\n\n388\n00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,545\nyour kids' birthdays and all this,\nso that can make it easier.\n\n389\n00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:18,087\nSo one of the things I\nlike to show people,\n\n390\n00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:20,420\nis I like to take a phrase of some kind.\n\n391\n00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,078\nAnd if we can pull up my screen for\na second,\n\n392\n00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,230\nI'll show you what I'm talking about here.\n\n393\n00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,430\nI might do something like,\nthese are not the droids you\n\n394\n00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:33,750\nare looking for.\n\n395\n00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,150\nAnd hopefully I didn't make any typos.\n\n396\n00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,420\n>> Looks good\n>> I did misspell droids there though.\n\n397\n00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,330\nDrids?\n\n398\n00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:38,950\n>> Driods.\n\n399\n00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,480\n[LAUGH]\n>> There we go.\n\n400\n00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,242\nSo there's a simple little saying, and\nwhat I might do if I'm trying to come up\n\n401\n00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:47,495\nwith a password, I might take\nthe first letter of each one of those.\n\n402\n00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:55,050\nSo I'd say something like, these are not\nthe droids you are looking for, right?\n\n403\n00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:58,071\nSo right there, I've got a one,\ntwo, three, four, five, six,\n\n404\n00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,090\nseven, eight, a nine character password.\n\n405\n00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,660\nAnd then a little simple substitution,\nlet me throw a capital letter in there.\n\n406\n00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,740\nOops, and it's not liking that.\n\n407\n00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,190\nMaybe I throw a capital letter in there,\nall right?\n\n408\n00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:10,915\n>> Maybe two.\n\n409\n00:20:10,915 --> 00:20:13,640\n[LAUGH]\n>> And then maybe I take that L and\n\n410\n00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,120\nturn it into a 1, for example.\n\n411\n00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,915\nAnd I take that A, and make it an @.\n\n412\n00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,470\nAnd now I've got a link evidently.\n\n413\n00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,355\nLet's clear that formatting so\nyou guys can see that.\n\n414\n00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:32,970\n[SOUND] Where am I at?\n\n415\n00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:33,620\nLink isn't that.\n\n416\n00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,960\nAnyway, hopefully you can see that.\n\n417\n00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,340\nDon't know why it turned it into a link.\n\n418\n00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:43,155\nBut there are really simple easy way\nto make this completely random, right?\n\n419\n00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:46,970\nT-A-N-T-D-Y-A-L-F makes no sense.\n\n420\n00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:47,950\nIt's not a word.\n\n421\n00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,554\nNot gonna be found in the dictionary,\nyet easy for\n\n422\n00:20:50,554 --> 00:20:53,530\nme to remember because it's\none of my favorite sayings.\n\n423\n00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:56,200\nThese are not the droids\nyou are looking for, right?\n\n424\n00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,270\nSo take your favorite song,\ntake a lyric from your favorite song, take\n\n425\n00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:05,240\na quote from your favorite poem or novel\nor something like that, and take the first\n\n426\n00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,020\nletter from each word and then substitute\na couple special characters in there.\n\n427\n00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,610\nAnd bada bing, you got a completely\nrandom looking password\n\n428\n00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:17,765\nthat's gonna be extremely difficult to\ncrack and yet easy for you to remember.\n\n429\n00:21:17,765 --> 00:21:22,581\n>> I've actually, will just use these\nare not the droids you're looking for,\n\n430\n00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,000\ncuz it's super long.\n\n431\n00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,255\nI don't need any special characters.\n\n432\n00:21:25,255 --> 00:21:28,335\nThe length of it gives me enough\ncomplexity that I don't have to add\n\n433\n00:21:28,335 --> 00:21:30,315\nanything, I just make it all one big word.\n\n434\n00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:31,950\nIt's not found in the dictionary, right?\n\n435\n00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,200\nBecause it doesn't see it as one word,\nso I can use something like that.\n\n436\n00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,840\nIt's easy to type, if you know how to\ntouch type at all, and anybody that\n\n437\n00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,940\nworks with a computer on a daily basis,\nyou tend to get pretty quick at that.\n\n438\n00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,530\nYou can crank that password\nout really easily.\n\n439\n00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:46,240\n>> Absolutely,\nI mean that would be a very long password.\n\n440\n00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,360\nThen that'd be more of\nwhat we call a passphrase,\n\n441\n00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,840\nbut I mean it's the same thing.\n\n442\n00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,230\nYou'll hear those terms password,\npassphrase.\n\n443\n00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:56,410\nPassphrase just means there\nare several words strung together, so\n\n444\n00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,560\nit's really the same thing.\n\n445\n00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,830\nAnd in fact, let's take a peek,\nlet's show you guys.\n\n446\n00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:06,730\nI'll throw up a couple of websites here,\nand let's take that one that I just did.\n\n447\n00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:10,850\nAll right, so that one I ended up with,\nthe password length ended up being what?\n\n448\n00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,030\nNine, one, two, three, four,\nfive, six, seven, eight, nine.\n\n449\n00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:21,370\nAll right, and I had a capital letter,\nso I included a decimal, a digit.\n\n450\n00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,050\nI had a lowercase in there,\nI had uppercase in there, and\n\n451\n00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,570\nI had special characters in there.\n\n452\n00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,525\nSo if we take a peek at that,\nlet's see what we got.\n\n453\n00:22:31,525 --> 00:22:32,525\nOne hour.\n\n454\n00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:33,125\nYeah.\n\n455\n00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,225\nThat one's not the hottest.\n\n456\n00:22:34,225 --> 00:22:34,735\nOh, you know what?\n\n457\n00:22:34,735 --> 00:22:36,745\nI didn't put in my other\nspecial characters.\n\n458\n00:22:37,825 --> 00:22:39,825\nThat's my fault.\n\n459\n00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,210\nThere we go.\nI know it's a little bit better than that.\n\n460\n00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,780\nTry that one more time.\n\n461\n00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,950\nWebsite's giving me\na little bit of a fit here.\n\n462\n00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,850\nWe'll try this guy out.\n\n463\n00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,870\nThere we go.\nNow we've got 94 possibilities.\n\n464\n00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,750\nAnd still one day, so\neven that is not a great password.\n\n465\n00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,340\n>> That's right.\n\n466\n00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,050\nThe length.\n\n467\n00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:57,960\n>> Too short.\n\n468\n00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,550\nYeah, it's a good example.\n\n469\n00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,470\nAnother one you might try\nis this site here, and\n\n470\n00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,760\nI'll throw these links in the show notes.\n\n471\n00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,870\nThis is where you can just type it in,\nand that's kind of cool.\n\n472\n00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:13,255\nSo if we did that entire passphrase,\nthese are not the droids.\n\n473\n00:23:13,255 --> 00:23:16,310\nAnd you can see as I,\nI mean I'm not even finished typing.\n\n474\n00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:20,725\n157 billion years, all right?\n\n475\n00:23:20,725 --> 00:23:21,965\nAnd that's a desktop PC, right?\n\n476\n00:23:21,965 --> 00:23:26,706\nThat's assuming they're not using anything\nfancy, a special hardware device dedicated\n\n477\n00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:30,905\nto cracking passwords or something like\nthat, but that's gonna be a long time.\n\n478\n00:23:30,905 --> 00:23:33,485\nShould surpass my password policy, right?\n\n479\n00:23:33,485 --> 00:23:36,940\n>> You haven't even gotten to the end\nof it [CROSSTALK] as a phrase.\n\n480\n00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,520\n>> All right.\n\n481\n00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,760\nSo, really good.\n\n482\n00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,330\nYou can find these web sites out there.\n\n483\n00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:44,427\nYou can do a quick Google search for\nhow strong is my password and\n\n484\n00:23:44,427 --> 00:23:48,292\nyou'll find sites like this\nthat can test your password and\n\n485\n00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:50,470\nlet you know how strong they are.\n\n486\n00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,720\nSo Dan, let's see here, so\nwe talked about multiple passwords.\n\n487\n00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,660\nGood to use multiple passwords.\n\n488\n00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:00,500\nI like your idea of using the different\nkind of categories of passwords there.\n\n489\n00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,340\nSome reusability.\n\n490\n00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,670\nWe talked about the length and\nthe complexity.\n\n491\n00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:08,510\nThose are the two big things that\nare gonna give you that strong password.\n\n492\n00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,970\nI think we also talked about\nchanging it every so often, right?\n\n493\n00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:15,330\nWe have to follow our company's policy,\nand we change it for a reason.\n\n494\n00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,260\nAnd adding a one to the end of\nit is not the way to go, right?\n\n495\n00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,450\nThat does not mean, that's not really\nchanging your password all that much,\n\n496\n00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,640\nit's not gonna be considered secure.\n\n497\n00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,770\nSo don't just append a number to\nthe last password you've used.\n\n498\n00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,880\nA couple other things I want to leave you\nguys with, as far as best practices go.\n\n499\n00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,805\nNow that we know how to make a good strong\npassword, we've gotta keep it safe, right?\n\n500\n00:24:40,805 --> 00:24:43,410\nCuz no matter how strong that password is,\n\n501\n00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,880\nif you're not careful with it,\nit's not gonna do you any good.\n\n502\n00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,130\nWhat I mean is you can't\nshare your password-\n\n503\n00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,605\n>> So no publishing it on my website.\n\n504\n00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:52,790\n[LAUGH]\n>> No publishing on the website.\n\n505\n00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,730\nPeople will try to make a web page says,\noh if I forget my password\n\n506\n00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,830\nI can go to this web page and\nI can look up my password there.\n\n507\n00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,330\nDon't do that, right?\n\n508\n00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:03,590\nYour buddy calls you up and says, hey I\nneed to, maybe you're out for the day and\n\n509\n00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,430\nhe's like I need to get on your\ncomputer and grab that file.\n\n510\n00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,240\nCan I log in as you?\n\n511\n00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,610\nWhat your password?\n\n512\n00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,780\nNo, no.\n\n513\n00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,500\nCuz now that he's got your password\nanything he does is coming back to you.\n\n514\n00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,840\nYou might have permissions\nthat he doesn't have.\n\n515\n00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,820\nNow he's logged on as you, and\n\n516\n00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,680\nhe's gonna be able to access things\nthat he shouldn't be able to access.\n\n517\n00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,060\nSo never ever share your password, and\n\n518\n00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:26,255\nthat includes people that you\nmight think it's okay, right?\n\n519\n00:25:26,255 --> 00:25:30,355\nWhen customer service calls you up,\nyou get a phone call, you get an email\n\n520\n00:25:30,355 --> 00:25:35,295\nfrom somebody saying hey, we need to\nverify your password, no, do not do it.\n\n521\n00:25:35,295 --> 00:25:39,025\nEven your own IT staff should never\never ask you for your password.\n\n522\n00:25:39,025 --> 00:25:43,415\nBecause your IT staff, they can reset your\npassword, they can change it to whatever\n\n523\n00:25:43,415 --> 00:25:46,595\nthey want and they can access your\naccount if they really needed to.\n\n524\n00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:49,910\nSo it's probably a scam,\nit's probably somebody\n\n525\n00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:53,970\npretending to be your IT staff saying,\nhey, we're updating a database.\n\n526\n00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:57,570\nI want to make sure you still have access\nto it after we finish the upgrade, so\n\n527\n00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,250\nI need to get your password from you.\n\n528\n00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,790\nOh, sure, here it is.\n\n529\n00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,630\nDon't do it.\n\n530\n00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:06,010\nIf you get an email from your bank that\nsays, we need to change your password or\n\n531\n00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:10,790\nwe need to verify your password, don't do\nit, your bank doesn't need your password.\n\n532\n00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,210\nThey can reset your account,\n\n533\n00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,870\nand then you can change the password\nto whatever it is you want it to be.\n\n534\n00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,270\nSo no matter who it is,\ndon't share your password.\n\n535\n00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,832\nDon't leave your computer\nlogged on is another one.\n\n536\n00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:25,814\nIf I log in and\nthen walk away from my computer,\n\n537\n00:26:25,814 --> 00:26:30,250\nthen if somebody else walks up to it,\nthey don't need my password.\n\n538\n00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:33,630\nNo matter how strong my password is,\nI've already typed it in for you.\n\n539\n00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,560\nThank you me, right?\n\n540\n00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,210\nAnd now you can access\nwhatever it is you want.\n\n541\n00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,950\nSo it's very important\nto get into the habit of\n\n542\n00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,110\nlocking the computer before you walk away.\n\n543\n00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,177\nOn Windows machines this it's\na simple Windows Key + L,\n\n544\n00:26:46,177 --> 00:26:49,350\nit's all you have to do,\nas you stand up you can just tap that.\n\n545\n00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,496\nOn Mac, I think Mac has a combo?\n\n546\n00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,260\nOr do they?\nI'm sure they do.\n\n547\n00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,352\n>> I have no idea, I just shut the lid and\nit automatically locks.\n\n548\n00:26:53,352 --> 00:26:57,296\n>> [LAUGH] So\nfigure out what it is on the Apple OS, and\n\n549\n00:26:57,296 --> 00:27:00,930\nlock the computer before you walk away.\n\n550\n00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:04,350\nOtherwise there's really no point\nin having a password, all right?\n\n551\n00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:08,990\nAnd if you ever think your password\nis compromised, change it, right?\n\n552\n00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,520\nI mean there's no sense\nin taking a chance.\n\n553\n00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,630\nIf you think somebody saw you typing\nin your password, change it real quick.\n\n554\n00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,830\nNow if you made a mistake and\n\n555\n00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:23,430\nyou sent your password via email\nto somebody, change it real quick.\n\n556\n00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,590\nIt's better to be safe than sorry.\n\n557\n00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:29,640\n>> Yeah, this is definitely an area\nwhere I would say paranoia pays, right?\n\n558\n00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,460\nAnytime that you think,\neven you have the inkling that, hey maybe,\n\n559\n00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:39,470\nI'm seeing some funny activity from my\nYahoo account, or something like that.\n\n560\n00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,310\nJust change the password.\n\n561\n00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,120\nTakes two minutes to do it.\n\n562\n00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,270\nThey tend to hammer you about that anyway.\n\n563\n00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,790\nA lot of websites do anymore.\n\n564\n00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,810\nHey, it's been a while since\nyou changed your password.\n\n565\n00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:50,400\nWhy don't you go ahead and do that now and\ngive you that opportunity.\n\n566\n00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,870\nI mean, all you did was log in, and\n\n567\n00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:57,020\nthey jump you right to that page because\nthey understand how necessary it is to,\n\n568\n00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,260\nat random, change your password,\nkeep that complexity.\n\n569\n00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,600\nAnd then like Mike was saying before about\nsharing your password being a no-no.\n\n570\n00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,484\nWorking in IT as administrators\nwe see it all the time.\n\n571\n00:28:07,484 --> 00:28:12,830\nAnd if you're just an end user, and you're\nthinking, man, this isn't a big deal.\n\n572\n00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,890\nI work with Sue, and\nshe's a nice person, right?\n\n573\n00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:19,025\nWell maybe Sue gets angry at\nthe company one day, right?\n\n574\n00:28:19,025 --> 00:28:23,945\nMaybe Sue is awesome today, and tomorrow\nshe's mad and she decides to do something,\n\n575\n00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:25,405\nand you guys share a password.\n\n576\n00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:28,405\nWell now it's either you or Sue that\ndid it, and Sue's not gonna go oh,\n\n577\n00:28:28,405 --> 00:28:30,065\nit was me, it was me.\n\n578\n00:28:30,065 --> 00:28:33,245\nShe's gonna mm, I'm not,\nhere it's this guy over here, right?\n\n579\n00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:35,261\nSo that's something you'd want to avoid.\n\n580\n00:28:35,261 --> 00:28:40,090\nIt just makes it easy to keep you out of\ntrouble to not share those passwords.\n\n581\n00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:43,200\nMake sure that everything you\ndo was legitimately done by you.\n\n582\n00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:43,820\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n583\n00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:49,270\nAll right, well Dan I think we've covered\npasswords pretty thoroughly there.\n\n584\n00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,340\n>> Awesome.\nHopefully our users out there got a lot\n\n585\n00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,460\nout of this and understand the importance\nof that password security.\n\n586\n00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,000\nYeah, can it be a pain\nin the old backside?\n\n587\n00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,380\nIt sure can, but it's our best and\n\n588\n00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,150\nfirst line of defense against\nanything that might happen.\n\n589\n00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:05,180\nSo it's good for us to understand\nthese things, why we do it and\n\n590\n00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,920\nhow we should be doing it properly.\n\n591\n00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,930\nAll right, Mike.\n\n592\n00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:10,930\nThat being said, I guess we've come\nto the end of another great episode.\n\n593\n00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,320\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n594\n00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,690\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n595\n00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,640\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n596\n00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,915\n>> And we'll see you next

another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,800\nI'm you're host Daniel Lowry.\n\n5\n00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,550\nHere with me today is Mike Rogers.\n\n6\n00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,310\nHow you doing today, Mike?\n\n7\n00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,840\n>> I'm doing fantastic, Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,850\nWe got another great\nepisode coming your way and\n\n9\n00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,200\nthis is our Security Fundamentals series.\n\n10\n00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,920\nAnd in this episode we're going\nto be talking about viruses.\n\n11\n00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,460\nTalking about what a virus is,\nhow we can detect that we have one,\n\n12\n00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,370\nwhich is pretty darn easy, typically.\n\n13\n00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,300\nAnd how what we might do,\nways we can get rid of that,\n\n14\n00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,150\nand protect ourselves from these viruses.\n\n15\n00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,830\nSo Daniel, I think the first thing we\nneed to do, we'll need to explain,\n\n16\n00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,700\nmake sure everybody is\naware of what a virus is.\n\n17\n00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,480\nBecause it's one of those terms that I'm\nsure you've heard hundreds of times,\n\n18\n00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,030\ndozens of times, what have you.\n\n19\n00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:54,820\nNews articles, TV, paper or whatever\nthe case may be, friends, around the shop.\n\n20\n00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,360\nOh my gosh, I got infected,\ngot a virus, right.\n\n21\n00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,840\nAnd it's a term that,\nit's really misused a lot.\n\n22\n00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,420\nAll right, when we talk about a virus,\na virus is this is a category of malware.\n\n23\n00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,890\nMalware is really the big umbrella or\nencompassing term for\n\n24\n00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,920\nsoftware that does malicious things.\n\n25\n00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,420\nMalware actually comes from\nthe combination of malicious software and\n\n26\n00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,042\nwe shorten them, squish them together,\nand we get malware.\n\n27\n00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:26,960\nVirus is just one category of malware and\nreally a virus is categorized by or\n\n28\n00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,730\nwhat makes it a virus is\nthe way that it spreads, right?\n\n29\n00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:36,280\nA virus is a piece of malware that\nis going to attach itself to a file.\n\n30\n00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,170\nAnd now this could be any type of file,\ntypically some type of executable\n\n31\n00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,570\nsomething that you've got to run,\nthat you get a hold of this file.\n\n32\n00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:50,000\nYou download something from the Internet\nor a friend sends you something right and\n\n33\n00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,870\nyou double click on it thinking\nit's gonna run some program or\n\n34\n00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,260\ninstall something on your machine and\nit is, but it's not what you thought.\n\n35\n00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,350\nAnd then what happens is, is that virus\nonce you've run that infected program,\n\n36\n00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,710\nthat virus is now sitting up in memory on\nyour computer, and everything else that\n\n37\n00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:10,380\nyou open up, it can try to attach to and\nthings that you don't realize.\n\n38\n00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:15,110\nAnd then you share those files with\nyour friends and then they run them and\n\n39\n00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,610\nthey get infected as well.\n\n40\n00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,720\nSo the thing about a virus is that it\nattaches to files, that's how it spreads.\n\n41\n00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,160\nAnd it really does need our help,\nit can't spread on its own.\n\n42\n00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,070\nAnd Daniel, I know you've obviously\nprobably dealt with cleaning up viruses,\n\n43\n00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,700\ndealing with infected machines.\n\n44\n00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,980\nThey can be pretty nasty, right?\n\n45\n00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,590\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n46\n00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,570\nThey get pretty dirty.\n\n47\n00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,700\nThey will definitely do some stuff.\n\n48\n00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,460\nOne of the worst things they can do\nis start deleting all your files.\n\n49\n00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,200\nThis is probably the worst thing\nyou would want that to happen,\n\n50\n00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,220\nbecause now, all my stuff is gone.\n\n51\n00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,160\nHopefully we do things like backups and\nwe talked on other shows the importance\n\n52\n00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,370\nof backups against the net and\nwe checked that out because\n\n53\n00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,520\nit's situations like this that make\nthose backups completely necessary.\n\n54\n00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,460\nThat is why we do these things and\n\n55\n00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,860\nvirus propagation is something\nthat happens all the time.\n\n56\n00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,930\nI've worked in a corporate\nenvironments and\n\n57\n00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,440\nin those environments I\nget a phone call probably,\n\n58\n00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,840\nthere was a certain time I got probably\ntwo, three times a day, a day.\n\n59\n00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,263\nThis was the probably, 40% of my workload\nwas handling people that had become\n\n60\n00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:15,550\ninfected with some type of malware.\n\n61\n00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,920\nSometimes that was a virus, and\nwhen those viruses hit, and\n\n62\n00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,550\nthey realized the damage that they've\nactually done, their people are crying.\n\n63\n00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,850\nThey're like, oh no!\n\n64\n00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:24,380\nWhat's going on?\n\n65\n00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,690\nAnd I'm like, well,\n\n66\n00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,390\nobviously we need to do a better job of\ninforming our users on what we need, how\n\n67\n00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,880\nwe can avoid those viruses from actually\ngetting our systems in the first place.\n\n68\n00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,760\n>> Exactly.\nSo viruses can be very bad,\n\n69\n00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,660\nthey can do things from just sucking\nup resources like making the process or\n\n70\n00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,140\nthe brain of your computer\nextremely busy which means\n\n71\n00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,250\nI won't be able to do anything else.\n\n72\n00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,440\nI try to click on something and\nit just sits there and\n\n73\n00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,580\nI get that spinning cheerio\njust staring at me, waiting.\n\n74\n00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,830\nOr it takes up all of my memory,\nor it starts copying files and\n\n75\n00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,890\nit just eats up all my free disk\nspace with a bunch of junk.\n\n76\n00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,135\nSeveral different things, like you said,\n\n77\n00:04:00,135 --> 00:04:04,330\nit could access personal information on\nyour machine and start sending that out.\n\n78\n00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,443\nOr I think one of the worst ones,\n\n79\n00:04:06,443 --> 00:04:09,900\nas you said starting deleting\nfiles off my machine.\n\n80\n00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,150\nAnd in that case, unless I've got a good\nbackup I've lost that information.\n\n81\n00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,460\n>> Yeah.\nEven if it doesn't delete it,\n\n82\n00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,750\nit can even just corrupt the data, right?\n\n83\n00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,450\nJust make it completely unreadable, and\nat that point it might as well be deleted,\n\n84\n00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,460\nbecause it's unusable at that point.\n\n85\n00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,710\nSo you might be seeing your files as\nthere, and you double-click on it.\n\n86\n00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,930\nThis would be one of the symptoms\nyou might come across.\n\n87\n00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,910\nYou could double-click on it, you're like\nwhy is this Word document I'm opening?\n\n88\n00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,620\nWhere's my Excel spreadsheet?\n\n89\n00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,740\nWhy isn't this happening?\n\n90\n00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,360\nAnd you're not getting the results\nthat you typically would get.\n\n91\n00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,310\nWell, that's an indication that\nsomething may be going wrong.\n\n92\n00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:46,880\nNow, it could just be the program itself\nor the file is corrupted because for\n\n93\n00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,770\nwhatever strange reason.\n\n94\n00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,320\nYou might not be infected.\n\n95\n00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,000\nBut that is a difficult symptom\nof having a virus infection.\n\n96\n00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,040\nSo if you start seeing all of your files\naren't opening the way they should.\n\n97\n00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,780\nAll of your resources are being taken up.\n\n98\n00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,800\nAll the time things are slowing down,\n\n99\n00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800\nthings aren't working normally\nlike you normally see.\n\n100\n00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,560\nThat's the real indication.\n\n101\n00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,300\n>> Exactly.\n\n102\n00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,380\nNow what do we do about it?\n\n103\n00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,582\nHow do we keep ourselves safe?\n\n104\n00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:14,980\nI'm gonna show you an example of what\na virus can do to a machine here in just\n\n105\n00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,210\na second, but before we go there I want\nto talk about how we keep ourselves safe\n\n106\n00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,350\nfrom these viruses and\nother types of malware.\n\n107\n00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:25,040\nAnd we've got another episode where we\ntalk about the other kinds of malwares.\n\n108\n00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,060\nSo if you aren't familiar with worms and\ntrojans and adware and spyware and\n\n109\n00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,780\nthings like that,\nmake sure you go check that one out.\n\n110\n00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,430\nBut for viruses,\nwe've got what we call antivirus software.\n\n111\n00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,230\nPretty straightforward, right.\n\n112\n00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,220\nI don't want viruses, so\nI'm going to get antivirus.\n\n113\n00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,740\nRight?\nThat's going to protect me,\n\n114\n00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,600\nhopefully from the viruses.\n\n115\n00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,540\nNow there's several different choices\nwhen it comes to antivirus software.\n\n116\n00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,500\nThere's free programs out\nthere that you can get.\n\n117\n00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,840\nThere's pay programs that you can get,\n\n118\n00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,440\ntypically done on a subscription basis\nlike a per month or a per year type thing.\n\n119\n00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,510\nThere's some that are built\ninto our operating systems.\n\n120\n00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:05,230\nLike Windows, ever since, let's see,\nWindows 7, we've got our Windows Defender,\n\n121\n00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,310\nwhich takes care of viruses or\n\n122\n00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,220\nmaybe it was Windows 8 when that\nswitched over to doing viruses.\n\n123\n00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,510\nBut Windows Defender now,\n\n124\n00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,520\nwhich is built into my operating system,\ncan take care of viruses.\n\n125\n00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,130\nI think Mac, I don't know if you guys\nhave anything that's built into it.\n\n126\n00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,270\nYou know, I don't think so.\n\n127\n00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,800\n>> I've never been down the Mac\nroad that much as far as antivirus.\n\n128\n00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,490\nI'm sure that probably\nmost of the corporate\n\n129\n00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,930\ntype of antiviruses would have something\nfor that, or maybe anything you pay for\n\n130\n00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,370\noff the shelf, they probably\nhave a Mac suite there as well.\n\n131\n00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,330\nSo whatever you're running, there's\nprobably an antivirus system for that.\n\n132\n00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,290\n>> Exactly.\nNow, which one do you get?\n\n133\n00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,672\nWhich one do you want?\n\n134\n00:06:42,672 --> 00:06:43,430\nWhat [INAUDIBLE] buy free.\n\n135\n00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,910\nSome of them are pay.\n\n136\n00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,330\nIs the pay better than the free?\n\n137\n00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,630\nWell, you know it really\ncomes down to this.\n\n138\n00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,870\nWhat you want is an antivirus\nsoftware that doesn't suck up\n\n139\n00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,690\na lot of resources, first of all.\n\n140\n00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:58,620\nIf I install that antivirus software and\nit makes my machine slow and then\n\n141\n00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,860\nthat's not gonna be very good because now\nI've got to deal with this slow machine.\n\n142\n00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,070\nYeah, it might be keeping me safe but\nit's really making it hard to do my job.\n\n143\n00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,690\nSo I want one that's relatively light,\ndoesn't take a lot of resources in\n\n144\n00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,050\nthe background and the other big thing\nis that it does its updates, right.\n\n145\n00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,070\nI've got to make sure that it's being kept\nup to date because a lot of the software\n\n146\n00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,420\nthe anti-virus software\nworks in different ways but\n\n147\n00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,240\na lot of them are what we\ncall definition based.\n\n148\n00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,810\nAnd that means that these anti-virus\nmanufactures they are vendors,\n\n149\n00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,510\nwhen they find an infected\nmachine they analyze it.\n\n150\n00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,190\nThey look at what that virus was doing,\nthey analyze that virus and\n\n151\n00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,720\nthey create a definition.\n\n152\n00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,480\nAnd then what happens is our anti-virus\nsoftware periodically goes out to that\n\n153\n00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,840\nvendor and\ndownloads those new definitions.\n\n154\n00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,280\nCuz new viruses are being\ndetected every day,\n\n155\n00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,430\nand they're putting out\nnew definitions every day.\n\n156\n00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,263\nSo I've gotta make sure that my\nanti-virus software is being up to date.\n\n157\n00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:52,267\nIf I buy some software, and\nit updates once a month,\n\n158\n00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:54,468\nthat's really pretty much useless.\n\n159\n00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:56,515\nBecause, like I said,\nthey're coming out every day.\n\n160\n00:07:56,515 --> 00:08:00,858\nSo you want anti-virus software that's\nBeing maintained, it's being kept up to\n\n161\n00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:05,610\ndate, and doesn't take a lot of resources,\nand finds most of the viruses.\n\n162\n00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,330\nIf they're doing updates every day, but\n\n163\n00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,840\nthey're not updating\nall their definitions.\n\n164\n00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,180\nMaybe they're just a slacker company,\nthen that's not what I want either.\n\n165\n00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,420\nSo pay versus free.\n\n166\n00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,260\nThat's really,\n\n167\n00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,500\nif I can find a free one that does all\nof that, I'm perfectly fine with that.\n\n168\n00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,380\nWindows Defender, for example,\nis a really good in antivirus software.\n\n169\n00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,360\nIt's built into your Windows operating\nsystem, the current version, and\n\n170\n00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,210\nit does a great job, and it gets\nits updates through Windows Update.\n\n171\n00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,360\nSo, it's kept up to date constantly.\n\n172\n00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,380\nI've run some older versions of Symantec\nthat were good, but they choked my system.\n\n173\n00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,870\nWhen it was doing a scan in the\nbackground, you'd start your system up for\n\n174\n00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,780\nthe day, and\nit would start the day doing a scan, and\n\n175\n00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,970\nit made it really hard\nto use that machine.\n\n176\n00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,566\n>> Yeah, I've used the corporate\nversions of Symantec antivirus, and\n\n177\n00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:53,370\nthey do a really good job of finding\nviruses, they're very intensive.\n\n178\n00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:53,870\n>> .\n\n179\n00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,700\nIt's a good product, as far as that goes.\n\n180\n00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,890\nBut like what Mike said.\n\n181\n00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,190\nIn this case the cure is\nworse than the disease right?\n\n182\n00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,470\nIt's doing all these things,\n\n183\n00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,035\nmaking your computer slow,\nbecause it's looking for viruses.\n\n184\n00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:10,835\nI remember a specific version of it,\nif you locked your computer, and\n\n185\n00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:13,145\nthen when you came back you log back in.\n\n186\n00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:15,375\nWell it would kick off\na full scan if you did that.\n\n187\n00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,705\nAnd that's counterproductive.\n\n188\n00:09:17,705 --> 00:09:19,015\nIt's not how you wanna work.\n\n189\n00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:20,535\nSo you do need to do some testing.\n\n190\n00:09:20,535 --> 00:09:22,385\nFind the right one.\n\n191\n00:09:22,385 --> 00:09:23,525\nThere are great free ones.\n\n192\n00:09:23,525 --> 00:09:24,605\nWe said there are free.\n\n193\n00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:28,525\nPay ones are obviously, they're gonna\nhave really good features as well, but\n\n194\n00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:30,700\nthat doesn't mean they're\nthe best option for you.\n\n195\n00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,890\nThe one that does a very good\njob of staying up to date.\n\n196\n00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,220\nOne does a very good job of not,\nyou never know it's there.\n\n197\n00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,460\nThat's kind of what you want.\n\n198\n00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,210\nYou never you never want to know\nthe antivirus system is there,\n\n199\n00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,240\nunless an infection happens right.\n\n200\n00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,330\nSo one that's going to\nbe resource intensive,\n\n201\n00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,670\nbasically doing the exact same thing\nyour virus is doing, just not so\n\n202\n00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,240\nmaliciously, is probably a product\nyou're gonna wanna steer clear from.\n\n203\n00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,650\nYou're gonna go with something that's\ngonna be a little less resource intensive,\n\n204\n00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,220\ngive you a little more fine tune control.\n\n205\n00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,310\nAnd if that means paying a little bit\nof money, well Its insurance well paid.\n\n206\n00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,370\nIt's really an insurance policy to say,\n\n207\n00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,320\nI would like to keep my data in\nthe state that that it's in.\n\n208\n00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,660\nUncorrupted, undeleted undefiled,\nlet's let's do that, and\n\n209\n00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,120\nit's really a minute cost.\n\n210\n00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,700\n>> Yeah, and\na lot of those pay versions,or those pay\n\n211\n00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,880\nprograms like Kaspersky,\n>> or Semantic,\n\n212\n00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,970\nit now runs Norton or McAfee, a lot of\nthose paids do more than just antivirus.\n\n213\n00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,830\nThey might include a firewall,\nPC optimization, like\n\n214\n00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,860\nspeed optimization type utilities, and\nclean up programs and things like that.\n\n215\n00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,740\nA lot of times,\nthat's where that money comes in.\n\n216\n00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,220\nAnd then you pay that monthly fee,\nor yearly fee, and\n\n217\n00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,770\nthat keeps your software up to date.\n\n218\n00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:44,240\nFor free ones, I like AVG,\nis one I've used before.\n\n219\n00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,460\nAvast is another one I've used before,\nand there's more out there than that.\n\n220\n00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,040\nAll right so, let's take a look at a virus\nhere, what I've got on my machine,\n\n221\n00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,620\nI got a little machine here.\n\n222\n00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,310\nAnd I attempted to write a virus.\n\n223\n00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,550\nNow, I'm not the best virus writer.\n\n224\n00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,030\nIt's not something I do all the time.\n\n225\n00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,560\nBut I got a little one on this machine,\nand\n\n226\n00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,540\nI'm going to attempt to\ninfect this machine.\n\n227\n00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:11,480\nI've turned off all of my antivirus\nsoftware that is on this virtual machine.\n\n228\n00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,380\nSo here it is over here,\n\n229\n00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,250\nand I've, if I was really doing,\nif this was a bad guy, all right?\n\n230\n00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,440\nThis wouldn't look so obvious.\n\n231\n00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,930\nYou guys might not click on\nthat program right there,\n\n232\n00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,650\nbecause it's got some funky gear\nlittle icon, and it says .bat.\n\n233\n00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,810\nSo with the proper user education\n,you might not even click on that.\n\n234\n00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,480\nBut the bad guy's gonna change that icon,\nmake it look like Tetris, right?\n\n235\n00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,250\nLittle color blocks, or something like\nthat, and he's gonna hide that extension.\n\n236\n00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,250\nThere's ways we can trick that, depending\non if you're even showing file extensions,\n\n237\n00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,950\nwe can fake that as well.\n\n238\n00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,850\nFor this one,\nI'm just trying to keep it simple, and\n\n239\n00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,930\nI'm gonna run it with Admin access.\n\n240\n00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:50,890\nWhich again would be part of the virus\nitself, if this was written by somebody\n\n241\n00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:53,910\nthat had had the time to\nactually create a big, bad virus.\n\n242\n00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,550\n>> Now Mike, I think this goes\nright back to what we were talking\n\n243\n00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,580\nat the very beginning about,\nhow did this propagate, right?\n\n244\n00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,570\nWhy does Mike even have\ntetris.bat on his system?\n\n245\n00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:06,070\nWell, like he said, maybe a friend sends,\nhey check out this game.\n\n246\n00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,365\nOr, like you said,\na friend sends these things out, right?\n\n247\n00:12:09,365 --> 00:12:10,370\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\nPeople can can\n\n248\n00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,890\nmake fake emails very easily.\n\n249\n00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,700\nIt's not a difficult task.\n\n250\n00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,595\nSo they craft out an email, and there's\na lot of people with friends named Joe, or\n\n251\n00:12:18,595 --> 00:12:20,095\nfriends named Sue, or whatever.\n\n252\n00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,985\nAnd they say hey Sue,\ncheck out this this cool game.\n\n253\n00:12:22,985 --> 00:12:25,035\nI've been playing it all day,\nit's so addictive.\n\n254\n00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,325\nAnd you go, cool.\n\n255\n00:12:26,325 --> 00:12:28,700\nYou download it, you see the attachment.\n\n256\n00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,260\nYou don't even think twice about it,\nbecause you trust that\n\n257\n00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,550\nit's really Sue sending you this this\nfile, and it's gonna be fun for you.\n\n258\n00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,110\nThat's the bait and switch, right?\n\n259\n00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,510\nAnd now Mike has this file on his system.\n\n260\n00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,220\nHe just wants to play a little Tetris.\n\n261\n00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,360\nAnd so now he double-clicks.\n\n262\n00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,760\n>> Here I go.\nI'm gonna go and play Tetris, and sure!\n\n263\n00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,720\nHere it goes, and there's also ways they\ncan hide these windows from popping up,\n\n264\n00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,670\nso you don't even see this.\n\n265\n00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,310\nThere's ways to make a game\nof Tetris pop up, and\n\n266\n00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,000\nthis stuff happens in the background.\n\n267\n00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,260\nAgain, I don't like a lot of time,\nI just want to make something for\n\n268\n00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,810\nthis little demo here, so\nthat we can actually see in those sites,\n\n269\n00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,190\nyou're talking about way you get infected.\n\n270\n00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,130\nEmail's a great one.\n\n271\n00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:08,850\nI send you, from a friend, that that\nemail with a link to download this, or\n\n272\n00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,120\na lot of people love to do searches for\nfree games.\n\n273\n00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,250\nAnd you'll find some web site, there's\nhundreds of games that are free, and\n\n274\n00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,020\nsome of them will be like wow,\nI can't believe this is free.\n\n275\n00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,330\nYeah, it's not free.\n\n276\n00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,300\nIt's not the actual game.\n\n277\n00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,185\n>> Well, you're gonna pay for it.\n\n278\n00:13:20,185 --> 00:13:21,820\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, I forgot to show you guys.\n\n279\n00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,930\nNow you probably noticed before I ran\nthis, I had five documents in here.\n\n280\n00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,770\nI had three Excel spreadsheets,\nand I had two Word docs.\n\n281\n00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,100\nMy Word documents are gone now.\n\n282\n00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,080\nAll right, so it deleted that virus.\n\n283\n00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,870\nI'm now infected, and it deleted all\nWord documents, it actually scanned\n\n284\n00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:43,420\nmy entire hard drive and looked for\nany Word document and deleted it.\n\n285\n00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,105\nAnd then scanned my entire drive again,\nand look for any Excel files, and\n\n286\n00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:49,505\nit didn't delete them.\n\n287\n00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:50,915\nIt infected them.\n\n288\n00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:53,795\nNow, again, I didn't do the best\njob of writing this, so\n\n289\n00:13:53,795 --> 00:13:57,635\nit's kind of obvious the icon\nchanged on these little files.\n\n290\n00:13:57,635 --> 00:14:00,763\nAnd now it says Windows batch file,\ninstead of spreadsheet.\n\n291\n00:14:00,763 --> 00:14:04,585\nBut somebody thst was better at\nwriting a virus could fix all of that.\n\n292\n00:14:04,585 --> 00:14:06,175\nSo now this machine's infected.\n\n293\n00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:07,690\nBad news.\n\n294\n00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,730\nBut remember,\nviruses need our help to spread.\n\n295\n00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,960\nThey can't spread on their own.\n\n296\n00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,020\nSo what I'm gonna do,\n\n297\n00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,940\nis show you what would typically\nhappen in a corporate environment.\n\n298\n00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,750\nI don't know that that's infected, right?\n\n299\n00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,930\nThe guy from the first computer,\n\n300\n00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,220\nhe doesn't know his\nspreadsheets are now infected.\n\n301\n00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,760\nSo, this guy over here is gonna say hey,\nI need a copy of that spreadsheet.\n\n302\n00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,510\nSure, connect to my machine and\ngo ahead and\n\n303\n00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,120\ngrab yourself a copy of that spreadsheet.\n\n304\n00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,100\nAll right, so now that one machine has\nthose infected Excel spreadsheets on\n\n305\n00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,590\nthere, and what's gonna happen?\n\n306\n00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,680\nThis is the way it happens\nin a corporate environment,\n\n307\n00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,320\nremember viruses can't spread on\ntheir own, they need help from us.\n\n308\n00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,350\nSo now I'm on a different machine, and\n\n309\n00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,800\nI'm going to connect to that\nout of the infected machine.\n\n310\n00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,860\nAnd I'm calling my buddy, hey I need\na copy of that spreadsheet that you carry.\n\n311\n00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,360\nDon't you have that payroll spreadsheet.\n\n312\n00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,150\nHe says, yeah I've got it shared out\nunder corp docs, just go ahead and\n\n313\n00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,460\ngrab yourself a copy.\n\n314\n00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,910\nSo I connect over to his machine.\n\n315\n00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,520\nI say oh,\nthere's that payroll spreadsheet.\n\n316\n00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,270\nI'm going to grab a copy and\nput it over here on my desktop.\n\n317\n00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,020\nI don't know that the files infected,\nright?\n\n318\n00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,700\nNow, again.\n\n319\n00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,570\nI didn't, I'm not the best virus writer.\n\n320\n00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:14,970\nSo I'm gonna have to change\nthe extension on this file, manually.\n\n321\n00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,110\nIn the real world,\nyou would not have to do this.\n\n322\n00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,370\nYou would be infected.\n\n323\n00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,024\nIf you had to do this,\nyou would get infected, right?\n\n324\n00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:22,100\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n>> That would be nice.\n\n325\n00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,880\n>> You probably wouldn't even see\nthe file extensions at this point.\n\n326\n00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,700\nVirus writers are very\ncrafty group of people.\n\n327\n00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,300\nThey know all the little tricks, and\n\n328\n00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,010\nall the little little ways to\nget around you from detecting\n\n329\n00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,400\nthat what they've actually sent you,\nis something that you don't really want.\n\n330\n00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,900\nThey're very crafty people.\n\n331\n00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,380\n>> Exactly, so there it is.\n\n332\n00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,860\nI went and grabbed that spreadsheet from\nmy buddy, not knowing it's infected.\n\n333\n00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,828\nAnd you'll see that on my computer,\nI have three Word docs, and\n\n334\n00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:53,524\nI'm gonna open up this spreadsheet\nthat I got from my buddy.\n\n335\n00:15:53,524 --> 00:15:56,744\nAnd again, a well written virus\nwould hide all of this stuff.\n\n336\n00:15:56,744 --> 00:15:57,876\nI wouldn't see all this going on.\n\n337\n00:15:57,876 --> 00:16:02,483\nBut if you watch my folder over here,\nIn a second this virus is doing its thing.\n\n338\n00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:05,494\nIt's running in the background and\n\n339\n00:16:05,494 --> 00:16:11,590\nit's going to should actually,\nin this case, delete my files.\n\n340\n00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,410\nSo we'll give it just\na second to run here.\n\n341\n00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,260\nRight now what is, this particular\nvirus that I wrote is looking for\n\n342\n00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,000\nall spreadsheets that it can infect them.\n\n343\n00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,650\nSo that's how it's gonna help\npropagate itself, right?\n\n344\n00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,540\nIt's looking for all my spreadsheets so\nthey can infect them.\n\n345\n00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,340\nSo if I send a spreadsheet to somebody\nelse, they can now get infected, right?\n\n346\n00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,770\nThat's how it propagates,\nis it attaches to certain files, and\n\n347\n00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:35,910\nthen we share those files out, and\npretty soon, it's like the whole, and\n\n348\n00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,240\nshe told two friends, and they told\ntwo friends, and so on and so on.\n\n349\n00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,390\nAnd pretty soon everyone\nin the office is infected.\n\n350\n00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:47,960\nAnd there you go, all of my Word\ndocs have disappeared, all right?\n\n351\n00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,490\nSo I am infected.\n\n352\n00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,470\nAnd then really easy.\n\n353\n00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:56,960\nI mean, as far as how I got infected,\nI got a file from my buddy, right?\n\n354\n00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,730\nI assumed it was safe, I double\nclicked on it and bam, I'm infected.\n\n355\n00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:04,080\nHe probably didn't even know the file\nthat he sent me was infected.\n\n356\n00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,850\n>> Yeah, and you might think well,\nbig deal right?\n\n357\n00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:09,610\nYou deleted some some Word documents,\nnot a really big whoop.\n\n358\n00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,210\nWell, what if you were a student and\nthose were your dissertations for\n\n359\n00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,350\nyour Master's Degree?\n\n360\n00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:14,900\nRight?\n\n361\n00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,120\nThat would be a big deal to you.\n\n362\n00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,230\nThat would be huge.\n\n363\n00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,210\nMaybe you work for a company.\n\n364\n00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:23,310\nAnd those are contracts that\nyou had saved on your computer.\n\n365\n00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,290\nThat would be a big deal.\n\n366\n00:17:25,418 --> 00:17:27,430\nData, even in the most mundane,\n\n367\n00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:31,600\nseemingly mundane form,\ncan become a very large deal.\n\n368\n00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,110\nAnd something as simple as the virus that\nMike wrote can cause a lot of damage.\n\n369\n00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,060\nSo this is why we need to\nemploy these antivirus systems,\n\n370\n00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,530\nkeep us safe from even what we would\nthink of off the top of our heads\n\n371\n00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,120\nas being not such a big deal, but\nreally might be that big deal.\n\n372\n00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,430\nSo we need some antivirus,\nMike, what do we do?\n\n373\n00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,545\n>> All right, so\nnow that we've got an infected machine,\n\n374\n00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:53,900\nlet's look at how we can clean it.\n\n375\n00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,490\nSo, we're gonna take\na look at my machine here.\n\n376\n00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:59,900\nAnd what we've done, a little TV magic so\nthat we don't have to wait for the scan.\n\n377\n00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,500\nBecause a scan,\nwhat you would do normally, is you would\n\n378\n00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,490\nfire up your antivirus software and\nyou would let it scan your system.\n\n379\n00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:10,470\nAnd it can take a long time depending\non how big your hard drives are and\n\n380\n00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,420\nwhat type of scan you do.\n\n381\n00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,810\nIt could take 30 minutes or\nlonger to scan that thing.\n\n382\n00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,750\nWe don't want you guys to sit here and\nwait, so I've already run a scan.\n\n383\n00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,540\nOn this machine,\nI've got Windows Defender.\n\n384\n00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,620\nNow Windows Defender is that built in\nantivirus software that comes from\n\n385\n00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,710\nMicrosoft and I've run a scan.\n\n386\n00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,080\nAnd I can see that it is found.\n\n387\n00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,750\nNow it tells me my status is protected.\n\n388\n00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,830\nThat's because I've turned it back on and\n\n389\n00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,070\nit's now doing what we\ncall real time protection.\n\n390\n00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:41,360\nSo if I download something now,\nit's gonna to scan it as I download it.\n\n391\n00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,980\nAnd if it sees something malicious\nin there, it's gonna warn me.\n\n392\n00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,240\nWhich, if I had had that before I\ndownloaded that game of Tetris from\n\n393\n00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,810\nDaniel, I might not have gotten\ninfected in the first place.\n\n394\n00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,980\nBut we turn it off so\nwe could show you guys.\n\n395\n00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,730\nSo, now I've come in, I've run the scan,\nand what I do is I go to my history and\n\n396\n00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,720\nI can see quarantined items.\n\n397\n00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,640\nSo what my antivirus has\ndone is it said hey,\n\n398\n00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,530\nwe found something that\nmatches a definition.\n\n399\n00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:09,680\nWe are pretty sure this is a bad file,\nthat this file is infected.\n\n400\n00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,621\nAnd it's got it listed here,\nit's a virus tool Win32 etc., etc.\n\n401\n00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:15,240\nAnd it quarantines it.\n\n402\n00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,760\nIt says I'm gonna take it and I'm gonna\nput it where nobody can get to it.\n\n403\n00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,080\nAnd it can't get to anything else and\nI'm gonna keep it safe.\n\n404\n00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,850\nNow some of these antivirus, I could tell\nit to just go ahead and delete it without\n\n405\n00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,810\nquarantining it, but it might have been\nan important file that got infected.\n\n406\n00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,970\nSomething that I didn't have a backup of,\n\n407\n00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,560\nsomething that I can't\nrecreate really easy.\n\n408\n00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,360\nSo I could try to clean the file.\n\n409\n00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,980\nTry to remove the infection from the file\nwhich usually doesn't work out too well.\n\n410\n00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,400\nI don't know if you've ever had much\nluck cleaning individual files or.\n\n411\n00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,040\n>> You can do it, it takes a while and\nsometimes you'll get like you cannot\n\n412\n00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,750\ndelete this file because It\nis protected by the system.\n\n413\n00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,470\nAnd then you've gotta do some\nadministrative stuff to unlock\n\n414\n00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,550\nthe file and take ownership file,\nthings of that nature.\n\n415\n00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,600\nIt's a lot of tech voodoo\nthat gets involved\n\n416\n00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,480\nwith actually getting those files deleted.\n\n417\n00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,490\nIt's a whole lot easier if the system\nitself can do that job for me.\n\n418\n00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,180\nYou just run with appropriate privileges\nand you should be good to go.\n\n419\n00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,730\n>> Exactly.\nSo\n\n420\n00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,348\nwhat I'm gonna do here is after my scan,\nit tells me it found these items.\n\n421\n00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:18,850\nI'm just gonna come over here and\ncheck what I want to get rid of and\n\n422\n00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,600\nclick Remove.\n\n423\n00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,030\nOr I could just click Remove all,\nand that's going to clean the items.\n\n424\n00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,840\nThat's going to permanently delete\nthe infected files from my system.\n\n425\n00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,070\nAnd at this point, I'm good to go.\n\n426\n00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:33,050\nI'm back up in business and\nall the infection is gone.\n\n427\n00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,930\nI should be okay at this point.\n\n428\n00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,400\nNow while I'm in here I wanna\nshow you a couple of settings.\n\n429\n00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,370\nDifferent antivirus software is\ngonna be slightly different, but\n\n430\n00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,740\nmost of them have a lot\nof the same settings.\n\n431\n00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,310\nA couple things you want to look for\nin your antivirus software settings,\n\n432\n00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:49,920\nreal time protection, again they\nmight call it something else but\n\n433\n00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,890\nit's gonna be something similar to that.\n\n434\n00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,420\nIs that's what's gonna keep me safe,\nright?\n\n435\n00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,760\nInstead of waiting until\nl'm getting infected, and\n\n436\n00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,670\nthen do something after the fact.\n\n437\n00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,600\nThis is gonna try to keep me from\ngetting infected in the first place.\n\n438\n00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,340\nIt'll scan files that I download\nfrom unknown or untrusted sites, and\n\n439\n00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,590\nlet me know if it sees something bad.\n\n440\n00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:12,400\nYou can also exclude certain file types,\nand/or files in locations.\n\n441\n00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,659\nMost people are not gonna have a use for\nthis.\n\n442\n00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,070\nIf you're a programmer though,\n\n443\n00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:21,160\nyou might be writing code that\ntriggers your antivirus, and\n\n444\n00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,450\nyou wanna make sure your antivirus\ndoesn't pick it up and try to remove it.\n\n445\n00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,510\nSo maybe you've got a folder that you say,\nlook, anything in here, don't scan.\n\n446\n00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,950\nMost of us really don't need that option.\n\n447\n00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:36,140\nSecurity guys, I play with a lot of tools\nthat are considered viruses or malware.\n\n448\n00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,960\nAnd so I've got a folder,\nI don't know about you, Dan,\n\n449\n00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,200\nI've got a folder that I keep where it's\nnot allowed to touch it just in case.\n\n450\n00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,910\n>> And you'd actually be surprised,\nthere is a lot of legitimate third party\n\n451\n00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,750\nsoftware that's out there that\nwill get flagged as a virus.\n\n452\n00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,520\nJust because they're not a huge company,\n\n453\n00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,160\nmaybe they make a very\nspecific type of software.\n\n454\n00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,940\nI remember there was, some of our users\nwere employing a time clock software and\n\n455\n00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,550\nit was getting flagged as a virus and\nit wasn't.\n\n456\n00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:03,690\nIt was totally legitimate software, and\nwe had to make an exclusion for that so\n\n457\n00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,830\nthat it would work correctly.\n\n458\n00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,820\n>> I probably did something\nin the background that looked\n\n459\n00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,910\nlike what a virus would do.\n\n460\n00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,810\nIt's probably looking in the registry for\nsomething, or scanning something, and\n\n461\n00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,710\nyour antivirus said,\noh my God, that's a virus.\n\n462\n00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,470\nBecause sometimes some of them, remember\nI said they can work different ways?\n\n463\n00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,850\nA lot of them are definition-based, where\nit has to be a match to a definition.\n\n464\n00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,970\nSome of them do what we call\nheuristics and behavior.\n\n465\n00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,390\nAnd so if they see any of this\nweird activity they can say oh,\n\n466\n00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,440\nthat might be a virus and\nthey can try to grab it.\n\n467\n00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,580\nSo you might have to make some\nexclusions for something like that.\n\n468\n00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,510\nAll right now, what I'm gonna do is\nswitch over and show you another one.\n\n469\n00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,350\nThis was that second\nmachine that I infected.\n\n470\n00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,500\nOn this one I'm running Avast.\n\n471\n00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,500\nWhich is one of those\nfree antivirus softwares.\n\n472\n00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,460\nAgain, for TV magic,\nI've already run the scan,\n\n473\n00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,960\nlet it do its thing, and\nyou see it says we found some issues.\n\n474\n00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,610\nWe have found viruses on your PC.\n\n475\n00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,930\nSo I'm gonna click Resolve All.\n\n476\n00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,950\nAnd it tells me that if found some issues.\n\n477\n00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,940\nThis one doesn't give me as much details.\n\n478\n00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,310\nThere are some statistics, but it's not\nshowing me what you think it would.\n\n479\n00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:11,670\nI don't know where the quarantine is in\nthis particular program, but that's okay.\n\n480\n00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,110\nI'm just gonna click Resolve All.\n\n481\n00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,230\n>> And you've got to remember,\nthis is an end user type antivirus system.\n\n482\n00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:22,000\nIt's free for one thing so putting in all\nthe hours of coding that would go behind\n\n483\n00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,700\nhaving those statistical\nboxes in the dialogs and\n\n484\n00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,580\nshow you all that stuff would take\ntime and effort on their part.\n\n485\n00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:32,430\nSo to keep it simple and make it easy for\nyou to be able to download, use, and\n\n486\n00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:37,210\nrun, they just have a very\nsimplified UI or user interface.\n\n487\n00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:40,752\nVery nice but Avast,\nwe like it a lot around ITProTV studios.\n\n488\n00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,380\nIt is one of the better free options\nthat you have available to you.\n\n489\n00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,120\n>> It really is.\n\n490\n00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,550\nSo you can see all threats\nhave been removed.\n\n491\n00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:50,859\nI'll click Next, and\nit tells me that I am good to go.\n\n492\n00:23:50,859 --> 00:23:54,414\nNow if I want to take a look at some of\nthe settings, show you that it's again,\n\n493\n00:23:54,414 --> 00:23:56,129\nsimilar to what you saw in defender.\n\n494\n00:23:56,129 --> 00:23:58,667\nI've got my active protection up here.\n\n495\n00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:00,479\nI've got my file system shield.\n\n496\n00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:02,635\nAvast actually has some\nreally cool options.\n\n497\n00:24:02,635 --> 00:24:06,390\nMail Shield, so\nlike attachments and emails.\n\n498\n00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:09,310\nWeb Shield's when I'm\nsurfing the Internet and\n\n499\n00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,370\nI'm trying to download\nsomething from there.\n\n500\n00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:14,790\nI've got my update options,\nmake sure my definitions are current.\n\n501\n00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,450\nWhatever tools that it comes with,\n\n502\n00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,700\nsome of these are gonna\ncome with the free version.\n\n503\n00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,970\nSome of them might require you\nto go to the paid version,\n\n504\n00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:27,260\nif you want that level of\nsupport there from Avast.\n\n505\n00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,760\nBut all in all, mostly the same thing,\nsame thing you're looking for.\n\n506\n00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,710\nMaking sure that realtime\nprotection is on and\n\n507\n00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,140\nmaking sure that it's updating\nautomatically in the background.\n\n508\n00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,720\nSo that as new definitions come out,\n\n509\n00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,640\nwe can we can keep our\nantivirus software up to date.\n\n510\n00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,220\n>> Yeah.\n>> So that's a couple of the different\n\n511\n00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,960\nantivirus programs, Windows Defender,\nAvast as we said in the beginning.\n\n512\n00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,940\nThere's several others for\nfree ones, there's like AVG, Pay,\n\n513\n00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:57,960\nyou get that Norton by Semantic,\nyou've Kaspersky.\n\n514\n00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,920\nThere's lots of them out there, just have\nto find the one that's right for you.\n\n515\n00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,550\nOr, if it's a corporate environment,\n\n516\n00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,730\nthey might have already\nmade the decision for you.\n\n517\n00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,100\nAnd they're telling you what\nantivirus software to run.\n\n518\n00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,590\n>> Yeah, one thing I would say about\nthe corporate environment is that,\n\n519\n00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,450\nI understand because I've worked there.\n\n520\n00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:17,770\nI've been the guy that, the phone rang and\nthe frustrated user was telling me,\n\n521\n00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,840\nthis thing is making my life\na living nightmare, right?\n\n522\n00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,810\nWe totally get that, and\n\n523\n00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:25,980\nthat's why we do our best to make sure\nthat these things run efficiently and\n\n524\n00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,650\nquietly, that you never even know they're\nthere unless there's an actual problem.\n\n525\n00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,560\nThat being said,\nwe do have to update it from time to time.\n\n526\n00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:38,180\nSo be aware that when your computer\nmight be running a full scan, but\n\n527\n00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,250\nthat might be because somebody in the tech\ndepartment maybe sees something that's\n\n528\n00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,295\na little off kilter, and they're\ngetting an alert that you don't get.\n\n529\n00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:46,810\nRight?\nSo you've got to remember that.\n\n530\n00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:50,260\nThey might be running a full scan on your\nsystem, and it can slow things down.\n\n531\n00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:50,900\nIt's not a big deal.\n\n532\n00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,910\nThey'll probably even contact you and say.\n\n533\n00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,440\nWe've seen some weird things.\n\n534\n00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,740\nWe just wanna let you know your\ncomputer might run slowly for\n\n535\n00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,190\na little while while we run a full scan.\n\n536\n00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,180\nNormally though,\n\n537\n00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,880\nwe try to run full scans at night\nwhen you're not even there, right?\n\n538\n00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,680\nAnd the best practice is we're gonna\nupdate your virus definitions and\n\n539\n00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,470\nheuristic definitions\nprobably twice a day.\n\n540\n00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,720\nBecause like Mike said,\nnew stuff is out all the time.\n\n541\n00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,275\nAnd then we're gonna just run that\nreal-time protection all the time.\n\n542\n00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,750\nWhich should keep those resources low.\n\n543\n00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,400\nAnd then once a week run\na full intensive scan.\n\n544\n00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,500\nSo, hopefully you're not\ninconvenienced too much.\n\n545\n00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,910\nBut bear with your IT staff, we understand\nit can be an inconvenience from time\n\n546\n00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:33,180\nto time, but now you know the importance\nof why they're running those scans.\n\n547\n00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,580\n>> Exactly.\n>> All right Mike,\n\n548\n00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,570\nhave we covered all the bases,\nI think, today?\n\n549\n00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,590\n>> You know we have, I think I'll just\nleave you guys with some parting words.\n\n550\n00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,360\nThe main thing I want you to remember\nfrom this is Antivirus is important.\n\n551\n00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,380\nYou've got to make sure you're running\ngood antivirus, make sure it's doing that\n\n552\n00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,110\nreal time protection and\nmake sure it's staying up to date.\n\n553\n00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:53,070\nAnd a combination of being\nsmart about what you're doing.\n\n554\n00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,730\nYou know,\nnot downloading stuff from unknown sites,\n\n555\n00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:59,070\nnot accepting attachments that\ndon't come from somebody you know.\n\n556\n00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,850\nAnd running good antivirus software and\nkeeping it up to date, and\n\n557\n00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,620\nyou can keep your computer safe.\n\n558\n00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,860\nYou don't have to be one of those\nstatistics that we see about on the news.\n\n559\n00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,720\n>> That's right.\n\n560\n00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,510\nAll right, well that being said,\nlooks like we've wrapped up another show.\n\n561\n00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,115\nHopefully you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n562\n00:27:12,115 --> 00:27:15,375\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n563\n00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:16,225\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n564\n00:27:16,225 --> 00:27:19,290\n>> And we'll see you

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,380\nI'll be your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,090\nHere with me today is my good friend and\ncolleague, Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:19,860\nHow you doing today, Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,450\n>> I am doing fantastic, primarily because\nwe've got another exciting episode of\n\n7\n00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,005\nsecurity fundamentals coming your way\n>> This one we're\n\n8\n00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:28,395\ngonna be talking about malware.\n\n9\n00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:31,937\nAnd malware's one of those terms\nthat we've probably heard, but\n\n10\n00:00:31,937 --> 00:00:35,226\nit's a little bit confusing\nbecause it's such a broad term,\n\n11\n00:00:35,226 --> 00:00:37,517\nit really doesn't have a specific thing.\n\n12\n00:00:37,517 --> 00:00:42,393\nSo when we talk about malware, first of\nall, it comes from combining two words,\n\n13\n00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:44,250\nmalicious, software.\n\n14\n00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,450\nShorten them up, plug them together,\nand we get malware.\n\n15\n00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,680\nBut that's pretty vague, right?\n\n16\n00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,190\nI mean, that can cover a lot of things.\n\n17\n00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,670\n>> Yeah, not not very descriptive,\nis it, Mike?\n\n18\n00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,390\nYou think malware, okay,\nI get it, malicious software.\n\n19\n00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,220\nStuff that's going to kind of do bad\nthings to my computer if I have it\n\n20\n00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,020\ninstalled, and it's not a hardware\nobviously, it's software.\n\n21\n00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,180\nIt's a program of some sort that\nresides on my actual system,\n\n22\n00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,390\ndoing all these bad things.\n\n23\n00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,340\nWell, we don't really like those,\nthough, do we Mike?\n\n24\n00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,650\n>> No, typically not.\n\n25\n00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,730\nSo what we want to do for you is find some\nof those terms that fall under malware.\n\n26\n00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,480\nYou've heard them, you've seen them in\nnews articles and things like that.\n\n27\n00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,880\nWe're gonna talk about each one of them,\nand\n\n28\n00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,570\njust give you a little bit of\na breakdown of what it is and\n\n29\n00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,360\nmaybe a little bit of\nhow it gets spread and\n\n30\n00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,850\nwhat I can do to protect myself against\nthese different forms of malware.\n\n31\n00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:32,960\nAnd let's start, Daniel, with one that's\nreally not, I don't know a good way to say\n\n32\n00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,895\nit, it falls in malware but\nit's not really doing anything.\n\n33\n00:01:36,895 --> 00:01:37,884\nWell, it is doing something malicious.\n\n34\n00:01:37,884 --> 00:01:38,513\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n35\n00:01:38,513 --> 00:01:39,850\n>> It's really hard to define.\n\n36\n00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,230\nWhat we're talking about\nis a Trojan horse.\n\n37\n00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,280\nNow most of you have heard the story\nof the Greeks and the Trojans and so\n\n38\n00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,060\nwe don't have to go back into all of that,\nbut\n\n39\n00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,360\nthe bad guys want to get this malicious\nsoftware on your computer somehow.\n\n40\n00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,680\nThey need to get you to help them, or\n\n41\n00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,270\nthey need to figure out a way\nto infect your machine.\n\n42\n00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,430\nOne of the ways they're gonna do that is\nby using what we call a Trojan horse,\n\n43\n00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,410\nwhich is basically wrapped around\nthe malicious software, and\n\n44\n00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,450\nit masquerades as something that you want.\n\n45\n00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:13,770\nLike it might be a game of Tetris,\nor it might be\n\n46\n00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,610\nan e-greeting card, or something like\nthat, something that you think you want.\n\n47\n00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,370\nAnd so you download it and you go to\ninstall it, and it might actually work.\n\n48\n00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,830\nThat game of Tetris might pop up and\nyou can play Tetris.\n\n49\n00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,120\nBut what you don't realize\nis in the background,\n\n50\n00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,150\nthe belly of that horse has opened up and\nit's delivered that malicious payload.\n\n51\n00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,890\nAnd now you've got something\non your machine that's\n\n52\n00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,820\ndoing something you don't want it to do.\n\n53\n00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,900\nDaniel, I think you've got a really\ngood example of one of these types of\n\n54\n00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,600\nTrojan horses.\n\n55\n00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,370\n>> So yeah, Mike,\nI do have a really good example.\n\n56\n00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,220\nThere are plenty of Trojan horses\nout there, and like Mike said,\n\n57\n00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,850\nthis is a delivery system for getting\nother types of malware onto your system.\n\n58\n00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,440\nSo, it is a little weird,\nit's a little ambiguous in terms, but\n\n59\n00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,700\nI think showing it will definitely help\nsolidify it in your mind a little more.\n\n60\n00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,350\nSo let's go ahead and\ngo to my computer, we'll get that up.\n\n61\n00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,740\nAnd you'll see I've got\nlittle alien head right here.\n\n62\n00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,270\nThis is a program called The Beast, right?\n\n63\n00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,850\nIt even sounds ominous, right, The Beast.\n\n64\n00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,290\nAnd what it does is it creates\na Trojan horse for you so\n\n65\n00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,870\nthat I can give that out, I can\nactually create a Trojan horse program\n\n66\n00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,700\nwith malicious software built into it so\nthat I can give that out to other people.\n\n67\n00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,783\nSo if I run it,\nI just click on my little icon here,\n\n68\n00:03:21,783 --> 00:03:24,379\nyou'll notice there's nothing flashy or\nspecial about it.\n\n69\n00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:27,410\nAnd anybody can download this,\nit is kind of fun.\n\n70\n00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,898\nThis is older kind of stuff,\n\n71\n00:03:28,898 --> 00:03:32,507\nthe newer Trojan horses are going\nto be a little more sophisticated.\n\n72\n00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:36,760\nBut this'll still work, this'll still give\nyou a lot of different fun stuff to do.\n\n73\n00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,620\nWe used to play pranks on each other\nin college using software like this.\n\n74\n00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,420\nBut the basics are still the same,\nyou can actually build a Trojan with this.\n\n75\n00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,140\nAll right, so you'll see that it's just\nasking me, I got a lot of options here.\n\n76\n00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,050\nOne of them that asks\nme to build a server.\n\n77\n00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,200\nSo that's if I want to\nactually create the package.\n\n78\n00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,880\nNow, I don't wanna get into\nthe whole technical how we actually\n\n79\n00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,750\ncreate a package.\n\n80\n00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,270\nIf you wanna play with this software\nthat's fine, it's relatively harmless.\n\n81\n00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,080\nMost antivirus systems will catch it and\nprobably delete it for you.\n\n82\n00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,940\nSo even if you can get it installed,\nyou got that going for you.\n\n83\n00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,470\nBut it's asking me for a host, right?\n\n84\n00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,050\nAnd that host is the person I actually\nwant to infect with this thing.\n\n85\n00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,500\nSo once I get them up and running,\n\n86\n00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,860\nI've actually built that package,\nI should be able to connect that.\n\n87\n00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,100\nNow what I've done is I've\ncreated a package and\n\n88\n00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,940\nI've put it in my documents here,\nin a little shared folder.\n\n89\n00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,550\nLet's see here, I think it's in my C\ndrive under, oop no, it's under my user.\n\n90\n00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:34,060\nSo I've got users and\nI've got my documents and\n\n91\n00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,300\nthere's a shared doc right here.\n\n92\n00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,730\nAnd it's called Leaked_Katy_Perry_Album.\n\n93\n00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,330\nNow this is a very common way\n\n94\n00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,820\nin which malicious software gets\nonto other people's systems, right?\n\n95\n00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,240\nThis really isn't a leaked\nKaty Perry album, I-\n\n96\n00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,900\n>> What?!\n\n97\n00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,127\n>> Yes I know, it's-\n>> What, wait.\n\n98\n00:04:49,127 --> 00:04:49,964\n>> Very disappointing.\n\n99\n00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:52,280\n>> I've gotta have it,\nI've got to have it right now.\n\n100\n00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,180\nI'm gonna click on it,\nI'm gonna download it.\n\n101\n00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:54,890\n>> Yep, and\n\n102\n00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:59,900\nit's reactions like that, that help\npropagate these types of problems, right?\n\n103\n00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,220\nSo what I do is I just named\nit Leaked_Katy_Perry_Album and\n\n104\n00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,550\nI'll attach it to an email,\nI'll stick it in a shared folder.\n\n105\n00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,190\nI'll put it on a thumb drive and\npass that around even.\n\n106\n00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,840\nI mean, even the old sneakernet\ncan still be a problem.\n\n107\n00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,510\nSo you definitely gotta watch out for\nwhat you're downloading.\n\n108\n00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,990\nYou gotta trust the source.\n\n109\n00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,130\nBut even then,\nit's still good to verify, right?\n\n110\n00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:18,903\nTrust but verify.\n\n111\n00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:21,820\n>> There we go.\n>> But I put this in a shared folder.\n\n112\n00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,580\nIf I go over to my other computers,\n\n113\n00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,710\nto my victim computer,\nyou'll notice he's downloaded that file.\n\n114\n00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,100\nHe's like man, I dig Katy Perry.\n\n115\n00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,445\nHer albums are awesome,\nI'm gonna listen to that now.\n\n116\n00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:36,572\nSo he double-clicks on that thing,\nand hm, well that's strange.\n\n117\n00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:37,127\nIt just disappeared.\n\n118\n00:05:37,127 --> 00:05:38,750\n>> Wait, where's my Katy Perry album?\n\n119\n00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,430\n>> Man, must've been corrupted,\nit must've been whatever.\n\n120\n00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,300\nNo big deal,\nI guess I'll go over on about my day.\n\n121\n00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,800\nThink nothing of it, right?\n\n122\n00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,770\nBack on my host computer.\n\n123\n00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,970\nWell now,\nif I open up The Beast over here, and\n\n124\n00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:57,190\nI put in the correct IP address or\nhost name of the computer,\n\n125\n00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,499\nand I hit Connect, or Go Beast.\n\n126\n00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,780\nYou'll see down here it says Connected.\n\n127\n00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,696\nI'm actually connected to\nmy victim's machine, and\n\n128\n00:06:07,696 --> 00:06:10,040\nnow I can start having a lot of good time.\n\n129\n00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,490\nThis is moving us into the next\ntype of malicious software,\n\n130\n00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,570\nwhich is called a backdoor,\nright, there's plenty of them.\n\n131\n00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,240\nThe Beast kind of does all things for you.\n\n132\n00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,740\nThis Trojan, the Trojan wrapper for\nyou that goes around the program, gives me\n\n133\n00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,790\nthat looks like a Katy Perry audio file\nkind of icon and all that, hides it from\n\n134\n00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:33,430\nthe from the victim, but also has the\nbackdoor software built into that as well.\n\n135\n00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,680\nSo not only do I get a Trojan, but I also\nget the backdoor software using The Beast.\n\n136\n00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,300\nSo now I can come over here and I can\ndo things like look at the files, and\n\n137\n00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,420\nI can say,\nlet me find my drives, oh, look.\n\n138\n00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:48,130\nAnd we know this is not my actual system\nbecause if I drill down the Users,\n\n139\n00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,760\nthis is the user I'm actually logged\nin as myself in the other, victim PC.\n\n140\n00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,430\nThere's the desktop right there.\n\n141\n00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,250\nIf I look at the desktop or,\nand maybe some other folders,\n\n142\n00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,150\nI'll see their files, right?\n\n143\n00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:04,790\nI can then, as you can see,\ndownload files, upload files.\n\n144\n00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,240\nThat can be very important, right?\n\n145\n00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,480\nIf I have sensitive information,\n\n146\n00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,430\nwell I now have access to that\nsensitive information on that computer.\n\n147\n00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,010\nNow this thing, you didn't see it because\nI didn't show you the creation of it.\n\n148\n00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,820\nBut in that I put a little,\n\n149\n00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,190\nit said to email me when\nthe software has been installed.\n\n150\n00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,650\nSo I get an email that says,\nit's on this computer.\n\n151\n00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,200\nThat's how I know what host name or\nwhat IP address that it's installed on.\n\n152\n00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,520\nIt actually emails that information\nto me and my hacker account or\n\n153\n00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,080\nwhatever you want to call it, right?\n\n154\n00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,500\nSo I now know that I can get in there.\n\n155\n00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,400\nI've got all the stuff going on.\n\n156\n00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,958\nOne of my favorites though is,\nyou can have a lot of fun, like I said,\n\n157\n00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,490\nwe kinda used this for a prank.\n\n158\n00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,380\nWe've got this fun stuff here.\n\n159\n00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,373\nYou can hide the mouse, lock the CD\nplayer, make him go to a different URL if\n\n160\n00:07:45,373 --> 00:07:48,880\nthey get their web browser open,\na lot of fun stuff.\n\n161\n00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,260\nOne I like is this chat, it's kinda fun.\n\n162\n00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:56,167\nOpen this up, if I hit Open Chat,\nand I say you've been hacked.\n\n163\n00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,590\n>> All your bass are belong to us.\n\n164\n00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:01,810\n>> Yeah, [LAUGH] and I hit send.\n\n165\n00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,430\nIf I go back over to my victim PC, well,\nyou'll notice they have a chat room open\n\n166\n00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:09,300\nnow, letting them know that I\nhave actually owned their system.\n\n167\n00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,600\nNow, obviously, if if I'm having a good\ntime, that would be the last thing I'd do,\n\n168\n00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,570\nis say, hey,\nI've actually hacked your system.\n\n169\n00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,083\nBut you see the connection, you see\nthe actual control, tons of control.\n\n170\n00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:23,826\nIf we go back over here and I close\nthis chat, you'll see tons of different\n\n171\n00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:28,210\ncontrol mechanisms,\nespecially when it comes to Windows.\n\n172\n00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:32,710\nI can hide all the all the windows\nthat are open, I can shut it down,\n\n173\n00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,490\nI can reboot it, I can log the user off.\n\n174\n00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,530\nWhat else do we have in here,\nwhat's in the Managers?\n\n175\n00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,960\nI can look at the processes and\n\n176\n00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,550\nservices that are running,\ncopy stuff to the clipboard.\n\n177\n00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,060\nThere's another one down here,\nit says passwords.\n\n178\n00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,640\nSo I have saved passwords that\nare in Internet Explorer,\n\n179\n00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,700\nthe kind of things that you say, always\nremember me on this site kind of thing,\n\n180\n00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,420\nit will actually pull\nthose passwords across.\n\n181\n00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,510\nI can even, if I go to miscellaneous,\nI have things like a key logger.\n\n182\n00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,350\nEvery keystroke that they make on\nthe keyboard, it's actually going to make\n\n183\n00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,120\na log of that, and I can see it,\nI can see everything that they've done.\n\n184\n00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,800\nSo hopefully at this point you're\nstarting to see why a Trojan horse and\n\n185\n00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,130\na backdoor could be\na very dangerous thing.\n\n186\n00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,006\n>> It makes for\na really bad day, doesn't it?\n\n187\n00:09:15,006 --> 00:09:16,390\nAnd is a great example, Daniel.\n\n188\n00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,310\nSo that Trojan horse was\nthat delivery mechanism that\n\n189\n00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,200\nwas allowed in to get that\nbackdoor program on that machine.\n\n190\n00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,760\nAnd if we're gonna define a backdoor, it's\na way to bypass the normal authentication.\n\n191\n00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,730\nNow that's what the bad\nguys are trying to do.\n\n192\n00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,652\nInstead of me trying to break your\npassword, guess your password,\n\n193\n00:09:31,652 --> 00:09:35,795\nget into Into your machine, how about I\njust get your machine to call me, right?\n\n194\n00:09:35,795 --> 00:09:37,135\nBecause that's going to be allowed.\n\n195\n00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:39,905\nYour machine isn't going to think\ntwice about calling out, right?\n\n196\n00:09:39,905 --> 00:09:43,915\nThe firewall at your company's office\nisn't gonna stop that outbound traffic,\n\n197\n00:09:43,915 --> 00:09:45,465\nit's something that you're requesting.\n\n198\n00:09:45,465 --> 00:09:48,760\nSo there's a good chance that that's\njust going to fly right through there.\n\n199\n00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,480\nAnd you saw the the level, once you had,\n\n200\n00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,770\nthat was system level access that he\nhad there, administrative access.\n\n201\n00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,240\nHe can browse the entire hard drive,\n\n202\n00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,630\nhe could do whatever he wanted\nto the machine at that point.\n\n203\n00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,380\nIt was no longer your machine,\nit's now Daniel's machine.\n\n204\n00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,290\nAnd that's why it's so important to\nunderstand what you're clicking on, to\n\n205\n00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:10,590\nmake sure that you trust the source when\nyou download something from the Internet.\n\n206\n00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,110\nWhen you get those emails from, friends,\nmake sure that it's legitimate,\n\n207\n00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,640\ndon't just start clicking on links.\n\n208\n00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,280\nIf you don't trust it,\nit's better to be safe than to be sorry.\n\n209\n00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,580\nOtherwise, we're going to\nhave a really bad day.\n\n210\n00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,560\nCorporate information gets leaked out.\n\n211\n00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,690\nProprietary information gets leaked out.\n\n212\n00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,920\nThe rest of the network gets attacked, and\nit's just not going to be a good thing.\n\n213\n00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,615\n>> Yeah, now, as you saw with this type of\nsoftware and there's other ones out there,\n\n214\n00:10:33,615 --> 00:10:38,445\nmore famous ones, things like SubSeven,\nthat was a very famous one for a while.\n\n215\n00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:42,835\nAnother one called BO2K,\nwhich is stands for something else.\n\n216\n00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:47,412\nI'm not going to say it, it's a little\nnot nice, but it's the same kind of idea,\n\n217\n00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:49,922\nvery powerful piece of software,\nthey were very famous.\n\n218\n00:10:49,922 --> 00:10:52,632\nAnd they're still used these days\nby administrators because, well,\n\n219\n00:10:52,632 --> 00:10:54,012\nthey give you system control.\n\n220\n00:10:54,012 --> 00:10:57,040\nIt's very helpful for a system\nadministrator to install these things on\n\n221\n00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,582\na system and say, well,\nI need to take that kind of control.\n\n222\n00:10:59,582 --> 00:11:04,292\nNow, because of the being reclimated\nby bad guys and using the software for\n\n223\n00:11:04,292 --> 00:11:08,034\nmalicious reasons,\nthe operating systems themselves and\n\n224\n00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:12,671\nthird party security suites have built\nin this type of control with better\n\n225\n00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:17,370\nsecurity features, so\nthat only the administrators can use them.\n\n226\n00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,060\nBut, this still runs around, and\nit's still around to this day.\n\n227\n00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,910\nSo, don't think that we're\nout of the weeds with that.\n\n228\n00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,940\nNow, that being said,\nthis is personally controlled.\n\n229\n00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,600\nI actually logged in, I did something\nwith it, and I'm controlling it.\n\n230\n00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,442\nBut nowadays, that's not really how\nit works anymore, too much anyway.\n\n231\n00:11:35,442 --> 00:11:37,697\nWe move into things like\nviruses at this point.\n\n232\n00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,920\n>> Yeah, and viruses are something\nthat I know we've all heard about.\n\n233\n00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,590\nWe've seen them in the news and\nthings like that.\n\n234\n00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:48,090\nViruses are bits of malware that\nare going to attach to files.\n\n235\n00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,830\nAnd that's really how we classify a virus\nis that it attaches itself to something,\n\n236\n00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,600\na file, an image or something like that,\nand that's how it spreads.\n\n237\n00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,090\nIt can't spread on its own.\n\n238\n00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,750\nSo you download an infected file, and\nonce you've downloaded that file and\n\n239\n00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,670\nopen that file,\nthat infection is now on your computer.\n\n240\n00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:10,530\nAnd all of the other files that you open\nare then gonna become infected as well.\n\n241\n00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,650\nAnd you don't realize it.\n\n242\n00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:15,020\nAnd then you send those files out\nto your coworkers, your colleagues,\n\n243\n00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,310\nyour friends, and\nnow their machine is infected.\n\n244\n00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,630\nAnd so all the files that\nthey open up become infected.\n\n245\n00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,870\nAnd they share files unknowingly,\ninfected files, with their coworkers and\n\n246\n00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,600\ncolleagues, and\nthis is how they're gonna spread.\n\n247\n00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,610\nSo viruses kinda need our help to spread.\n\n248\n00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,440\nThey're a little more\ndifficult to get rid of.\n\n249\n00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,480\nIf you've ever done any work\ntrying to remove viruses, because\n\n250\n00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,500\nthey attach to those files, sometimes it's\nhard to tell what files are infected.\n\n251\n00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,920\nSo we have to make sure we\nclean all of them, otherwise,\n\n252\n00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,360\nwe can reinfect ourself very easily.\n\n253\n00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,180\nAnd if we compare viruses to worms,\n\n254\n00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,740\na worm is another type of malware\nthat I'm sure you've heard of.\n\n255\n00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,870\nThe difference between a virus and\n\n256\n00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,020\na worm is the fact that\nworms don't need our help.\n\n257\n00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:03,050\nWorms are a standalone little piece of\nmalware, they don't attach to anything.\n\n258\n00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,300\nAnd you download a worm or\n\n259\n00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,200\nyour machine gets a worm,\nit can replicate all on its own.\n\n260\n00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,980\nIt's gonna go through your contact list\nand email itself to all your contacts.\n\n261\n00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,800\nAnd then once it gets to their\nmachines it's going to email itself to\n\n262\n00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,300\nall of their contacts and so on and so on.\n\n263\n00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,430\nAnd these things can\nspread extremely fast.\n\n264\n00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:24,300\nThings like Code Red and\nMyDoom and SQL Slammer was another\n\n265\n00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,440\none that it's mind boggling, Daniel,\nhow fast these guys can move around.\n\n266\n00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,780\n>> Yeah and\nthe MyDoom worm was extremely devastating.\n\n267\n00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:37,803\nIt caused $38 billion in damage and clean\nup from all having to hire people to clean\n\n268\n00:13:37,803 --> 00:13:43,090\nup machines, buying new machines, the data\nthat was lost, all that kind of stuff.\n\n269\n00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:47,300\nIt costs money, and\nit caused $38 billion in damages.\n\n270\n00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:52,790\nIt is the most prolific and devastating\nInternet worm ever to hit the market.\n\n271\n00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,275\nActually, I've got a screenshot of how it\npropagated to kinda show you what these\n\n272\n00:13:57,275 --> 00:13:58,321\nthings look like.\n\n273\n00:13:58,321 --> 00:14:01,100\nYou'll notice,\nthis is just a regular old email.\n\n274\n00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,060\nRight, it's just in Outlook message\nthat says, could not be delivered.\n\n275\n00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,780\nYou open that up.\n\n276\n00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,630\nYou think, okay, it says we have received\nreports that your account was used\n\n277\n00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,620\nto send a huge amount of spam messages.\n\n278\n00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,810\nYou're like, oh, really?\n\n279\n00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,680\nThat's a bad thing.\n\n280\n00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,570\nWhat do I gotta do?\n\n281\n00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,480\nPlease follow the instructions\nattached in the text file.\n\n282\n00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,930\nWell, what did we see\nwith the Trojan horse?\n\n283\n00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,470\nNow you see how the Trojan\nhorse comes back into play.\n\n284\n00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,740\nIt's got an attachment right here.\n\n285\n00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,730\nWell I download the attachment,\nthe Trojan horse software has\n\n286\n00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:30,020\nwrapped up that Internet worm into\nsomething that looks inconspicuous,\n\n287\n00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,150\nthat looks like something\neven maybe you want.\n\n288\n00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,530\nAnd that's how it gets propagated,\njust by that.\n\n289\n00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:38,640\nI think that this is a legitimate email,\nand I click on that, I download that, and\n\n290\n00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,290\nthen I'm infected, and\noff it goes to the races.\n\n291\n00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,170\n>> Exactly, and I think if I can pull\nthis up, let's see if it's gonna play for\n\n292\n00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,600\nyou guys.\n\n293\n00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,490\nIt doesn't look like the motion is\nworking there, but this is an example of,\n\n294\n00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:53,220\nI want to say this was after\nabout an hour of Code Red.\n\n295\n00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,890\nAnd you can see the spread on this thing,\nit's just mind boggling.\n\n296\n00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,960\nAnd it generates so much network traffic\n\n297\n00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,440\nthat it ends up doing a denial of\nservice on your network as well.\n\n298\n00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,290\nSo once a machine on your network gets\nhit with one of these worms like this,\n\n299\n00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,310\nit's replicating so fast,\nspreading to other machines so fast, and\n\n300\n00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,890\nthen they're replicating.\n\n301\n00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,810\nThat pretty much shuts\nthe network down and\n\n302\n00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,610\nmakes it very difficult\nto get any work done.\n\n303\n00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,510\nAnd you said,\n\n304\n00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:23,701\nI mean the amount of money that this cost\nbusinesses in downtime around the globe.\n\n305\n00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:27,813\nI mean, just about everywhere there's\ncomputer systems you can see has a big fat\n\n306\n00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:28,550\nred dot on it.\n\n307\n00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,570\nIt is amazing.\n\n308\n00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:34,720\n>> Yeah, well that being said, obviously\nthis one of most devastating attacks.\n\n309\n00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,320\nWe also have something that's probably\na little more common anymore,\n\n310\n00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,670\nthese days anyway.\n\n311\n00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,360\nAnd it is not as devastating but\nit is surely more annoying, and\n\n312\n00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,030\nthat is spyware, right?\n\n313\n00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:48,217\nAnd these are stupid little programs that\nget installed onto your computer through\n\n314\n00:15:48,217 --> 00:15:49,420\ndrive-by downloads.\n\n315\n00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,405\nOr you download a piece of\nsoftware that is legitimate, and\n\n316\n00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:55,760\nthis thing will kind of piggyback\nitself onto that installation.\n\n317\n00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,259\nIf you're not really careful when you're\ninstalling software from third party\n\n318\n00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:02,050\nsources, these things can tend\nto attach themselves to those.\n\n319\n00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,850\nSo you gotta do that custom install, make\nsure nothing else is trying to install.\n\n320\n00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:09,130\nBut all it starts doing is\nactually watching how you browse,\n\n321\n00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,270\nsee what you're looking at.\n\n322\n00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,445\nAnd then, they can, will advertise to you.\n\n323\n00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:15,890\nThey can send you spam e-mail,\n\n324\n00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:19,355\nthey can change what the ads\nshow up in your browser.\n\n325\n00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:21,745\nVery, very annoying kind\nof software in my opinion.\n\n326\n00:16:21,745 --> 00:16:22,586\n>> Absolutely.\n\n327\n00:16:22,586 --> 00:16:25,795\nSpyware, adware, it really is frustrating.\n\n328\n00:16:25,795 --> 00:16:28,705\nYou know, spyware, just like the name\nimplies, and as Daniel was saying,\n\n329\n00:16:28,705 --> 00:16:30,355\nit's spying on your habits.\n\n330\n00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:33,235\nIt could be tracking your browsing\nhistory, where you're surfing to, and\n\n331\n00:16:33,235 --> 00:16:34,195\nthings like that.\n\n332\n00:16:34,195 --> 00:16:34,945\nIt could be worse.\n\n333\n00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:37,840\nIt could be like Keystroke\nloggers that are capturing\n\n334\n00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,110\neverything that you're\ntyping on that computer.\n\n335\n00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,360\nIn fact,\nthe example that Daniel showed earlier,\n\n336\n00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,810\nwith that Trojan horse in that back door,\nhad a Keystroke logger built into it.\n\n337\n00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:53,110\nThere's also a special just software\nthat all it does is keystroke logging.\n\n338\n00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,720\nThere's hardware devices that people can\nplug into the back of your computer and\n\n339\n00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,500\nit sits in between.\n\n340\n00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,210\nBasically, they unplug your keyboard,\nplug this little device in where your\n\n341\n00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:05,020\nkeyboard would normally plug in, and then\nunplug the keyboard back in that device.\n\n342\n00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,340\nTeeny tiny little thing.\n\n343\n00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,542\nWhen's the last time you saw\nthe back of your work computer?\n\n344\n00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:11,965\nDid you ever get down on your desk and\nlook back there?\n\n345\n00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:13,695\nYou might not even know it's there.\n\n346\n00:17:13,695 --> 00:17:16,525\nAnd those things can e-mail\nthe results to somebody or\n\n347\n00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:18,915\nFTP them out or\nthey can come pick them up.\n\n348\n00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:20,315\nI got an example of one here.\n\n349\n00:17:20,315 --> 00:17:23,605\nI just pull up my screen, and\nI'm going to pretend, I don't have e-mail\n\n350\n00:17:23,605 --> 00:17:26,885\ninstalled on this machine, but\nI was going pretend I'm typing an email.\n\n351\n00:17:26,885 --> 00:17:29,685\nI'll just put in the account number.\n\n352\n00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:37,570\nBlah blah blah was some random number like\nthat, and I don't think anything of it.\n\n353\n00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,430\nAnd what happens is, let's cancel that.\n\n354\n00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,770\nJust a minute.\n\n355\n00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,370\nMinimize that for a second.\n\n356\n00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,650\nThe bad guy comes back later on and\npulls up his software, or, like I said,\n\n357\n00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:52,310\nit's talking to him remotely, or\nit's FTPing something back to him.\n\n358\n00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,510\nAnd here it is.\n\n359\n00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,340\nSo I can go in here take a look\nat this notepad file, and\n\n360\n00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,210\nthere's all of those\nkeystrokes that I just typed.\n\n361\n00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,100\nEverything including spaces.\n\n362\n00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,270\nIf I was to hit a backspace,\nbecause maybe I made a typo on there,\n\n363\n00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,350\nit would show the backspace and\nthe correction.\n\n364\n00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,710\nIt's capturing everything.\n\n365\n00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:13,360\nNow, think about you logging into your\nbank account from your computer or\n\n366\n00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,600\nlogging on to work.\n\n367\n00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,720\nIt's these kind of things.\n\n368\n00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,300\nAnything that you do on that system.\n\n369\n00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,090\nThese things can capture,\nso bad day there.\n\n370\n00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:26,730\nYou know, and then add where you\nare saying, is just annoying.\n\n371\n00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,510\nIt just and it does have its purpose.\n\n372\n00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:34,030\nYou know, we see web sites and we see\nthem, like I go shop at Office Max and\n\n373\n00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,910\nI look for a bookcase and\nthen I go to another website, and\n\n374\n00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,440\nI see a banner ad for book cases.\n\n375\n00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,010\nThat's the idea behind it, but\nit's gotten malicious too,\n\n376\n00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,120\nwhere I've gone to people's machines, and\nthey're getting pop-up advertisements.\n\n377\n00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,650\nThey don't even have\nthe browser window open.\n\n378\n00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,730\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's that bad.\n\n379\n00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,000\nThey can't get anything done on their\nmachine because these windows keep\n\n380\n00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,480\npopping up, and that's when it\ngets to the malicious point.\n\n381\n00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,890\n>> Yeah, and I've dealt with this\nstuff a lot in my career, and\n\n382\n00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,580\nthey can slow a computer down to a crawl.\n\n383\n00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,780\nIt's very annoying, and even though you\ncan uninstall it, it can take a while\n\n384\n00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,090\nbecause it's eating up all the resources,\nmaking everything run slowly.\n\n385\n00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,820\nIt's a very annoying piece of software.\n\n386\n00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,120\nI do want to show you what it kind\nof looks like to know that you might\n\n387\n00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,850\nhave this on your computer.\n\n388\n00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,660\nSo here's just some Google images here.\n\n389\n00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,660\nYou'll start seeing these are the type of\npop-ups, it's just pop-up, pop-up, pop-up.\n\n390\n00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,650\nIt's all over the front\nof your your desktop.\n\n391\n00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,530\nNow, we do have countermeasures built in.\n\n392\n00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,230\nA lot of the operating systems nowadays,\nand browsers that you use,\n\n393\n00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,780\nhave built in pop-up blockers to\neliminate a lot of this problem.\n\n394\n00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,130\nBut that doesn't mean you still\ncan't get infected with it and\n\n395\n00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,850\nit's still not gonna try to\neat up a bunch of resources.\n\n396\n00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,700\nThat being said you can also, let me\ntake it, let me close this real quick.\n\n397\n00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,210\nAnd we'll notice that\nup here they also have,\n\n398\n00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,280\nlet's look this up, adware, toolbars.\n\n399\n00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,500\nThis is probably the most common\nway in which we see this today, and\n\n400\n00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,790\nyou'll see these are some crazy looking\ntoolbars, but I've seen stuff like this.\n\n401\n00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,670\nAnd with every one of those\ntoolbars that are running,\n\n402\n00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,890\nthey're all trying to do something.\n\n403\n00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,130\n>> Wait a second.\nWait a second.\n\n404\n00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,880\nThat's my stepmother's desktop.\n\n405\n00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,820\n>> Oh, yep, we found her.\n\n406\n00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,210\n>> That's her browser window.\n\n407\n00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,220\nThere's this much browser space,\nand there's this many toolbars.\n\n408\n00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,240\n>> Yeah, so they'll show up that way.\n\n409\n00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:15,830\nVery annoying.\n\n410\n00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,310\nIf you start seeing toolbars\nthat you didn't install.\n\n411\n00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,610\nYou think, oh, there's a change there.\n\n412\n00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,160\nYou didn't make any changes\nyourself purposefully.\n\n413\n00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,850\nWell that's when you know\nyou've got a problem, right?\n\n414\n00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:31,880\nThat, you know something has happened that\nyou did not authoritatively say, okay,\n\n415\n00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,160\nI'm gonna allow that.\n\n416\n00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,440\nSo that's when you know that's\nprobably adware, maybe spyware.\n\n417\n00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,450\nAs well, and\nyou got to look out for that stuff.\n\n418\n00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,540\nIt can be annoying.\n\n419\n00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,470\nOr if it's spyware, it could be\nstealing information, passwords,\n\n420\n00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,060\ncredit card numbers, stuff like that.\n\n421\n00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,350\nSo, definitely bad stuff.\n\n422\n00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,320\nWant to get it gone.\n\n423\n00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,500\n>> Absolutely, and another class of\n\n424\n00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,370\nmalware that we have to deal with that\nwe've seen a lot of lately is ransomware.\n\n425\n00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:58,200\nNow, ransomware is a kind of\nsoftware that's going to come in and\n\n426\n00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,470\nrestrict your computer.\n\n427\n00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:02,030\nIt might lock up your browser window.\n\n428\n00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,310\nIt might lock up certain files.\n\n429\n00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:09,440\nAnd it's going to demand some form of\npayment to regain access to your system or\n\n430\n00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,690\nto those files, and I can show you,\n\n431\n00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,030\nreally one that that everybody\nprobably heard of in the news, but\n\n432\n00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:19,953\nI'll show you a quick picture,\nwas this the Crypto-locker, all right?\n\n433\n00:21:19,953 --> 00:21:21,960\nSo Crypto-locker was one.\n\n434\n00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,500\nAnd I can see from the screenshot,\nyour important files,\n\n435\n00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,420\nencryption produced on this computer,\nblah blah, blah, etc.\n\n436\n00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:32,100\nHere's a complete list of all your files\nand they're giving me a timer down here,\n\n437\n00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,880\nand what do they reckon,\nthey want $300 U.S. or\n\n438\n00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,040\n300 Euros to gain access to\nmy system again, all right?\n\n439\n00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,140\nNow, we want to make sure we understand.\n\n440\n00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,930\nDon't pay these guys, right?\n\n441\n00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:49,618\nNo matter how desperate you are to get\nthat information back, don't pay them.\n\n442\n00:21:49,618 --> 00:21:54,550\nThere's a 99% chance that you're, or\nmaybe 99.9% chance that they're not\n\n443\n00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,130\ngoing to give you the access to your\nfiles again, whether you pay them or not.\n\n444\n00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,250\nWhy would they?\n\n445\n00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,250\nThey might say, hey, pay me again.\n\n446\n00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,190\nOh, you did?\n\n447\n00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,640\nPay me one more time.\n\n448\n00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,330\nOr just never talk to you again.\n\n449\n00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,560\nI mean, they've got your money.\n\n450\n00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,890\nWhat do they care?\n\n451\n00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,700\nSo you get one of these.\n\n452\n00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,710\nDon't go down to the store and get a money\norder, and sent it off to these people.\n\n453\n00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,840\nGosh forbid, don't put your credit card\nnumbers in there or anything like that.\n\n454\n00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,310\nYou're basically gonna have to\ngo back to a backup most likely.\n\n455\n00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,690\nHopefully you've got a good backup of\nyour data so you can get back into it.\n\n456\n00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,780\n>> Yeah.\nThe encryption that they use on\n\n457\n00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,240\nthese types of ransomware\nsoftware is military grade.\n\n458\n00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,990\nIt is not going to get cracked.\n\n459\n00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,780\nYour files, unfortunately,\nare gone at that point.\n\n460\n00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,160\nAnd you might be saying,\nwell, what can I do?\n\n461\n00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,440\nWell, the best thing you can do is verify\nthat any time you download something from\n\n462\n00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,950\na third party, that is legitimate,\nrun anti-virus, run anti-malware software.\n\n463\n00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,050\nIf you're in a company, you probably have\nan anti-virus suite on your computer.\n\n464\n00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:55,260\nSo make sure that you scan that file, make\nsure that it is scanning that file and\n\n465\n00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,800\nthat should help keep you out of\nthe weeds when it comes to these things.\n\n466\n00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,010\nCuz ransomware he is the baddest\nboy on the block these days.\n\n467\n00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,920\nPeople are losing files left and right.\n\n468\n00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,760\nI've got phone calls, e-mails.\n\n469\n00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,090\nHey I know you know about computers,\n\n470\n00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,790\nI've been hit with this crypto\nlocker thing what can I do?\n\n471\n00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,980\nI said I hope you' got a good back up\nbecause that's about all you can do.\n\n472\n00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,120\nSo, be really careful when it\ncomes to that if you get that guy.\n\n473\n00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,140\nIt's a bad day for everyone.\n\n474\n00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,050\nHopefully you have a good\nbackup at that point.\n\n475\n00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,000\n>> Exactly.\n\n476\n00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,180\nCuz that's really all you can do.\n\n477\n00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:24,830\n>> Yeah.\n\n478\n00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:29,070\n>> Another category that's very similar\nto Ransomware in the way it looks and\n\n479\n00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,810\nbehaves is Scareware, right?\n\n480\n00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:36,200\nScareware's gonna be one of those bits of\nmalware that pops up on your system, and\n\n481\n00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,860\nit tries to scare you\ninto paying them money.\n\n482\n00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,120\nRansomware holds something hostage\ntrying to get you to pay money.\n\n483\n00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,750\nScareware tries to scare\nyou into paying money.\n\n484\n00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,510\nGreat example was that good old Win\n7 antivirus that we had to deal with\n\n485\n00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,220\na while ago.\n\n486\n00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,220\nAnd in fact, I've had people in my\nfamily fall victim to these things.\n\n487\n00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,772\nWindow pops up on your computer and\nsays, oh my gosh,\n\n488\n00:23:56,772 --> 00:23:59,170\nyou've got 5,000 viruses on your machine.\n\n489\n00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,760\nBut don't worry,\nwe've got the product that can help you.\n\n490\n00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,730\nClick here, buy our software and\nwe'll clean it up for you, no problem.\n\n491\n00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:10,490\nAnd so you buy the software and\nnothing happens.\n\n492\n00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:15,025\nProblem is you didn't have any viruses on\nyour machine, it was a fake AV, right?\n\n493\n00:24:15,025 --> 00:24:18,105\nAnd it was just trying to\nget you to spend that money.\n\n494\n00:24:18,105 --> 00:24:20,295\nAnd if you gave them your credit card,\n\n495\n00:24:20,295 --> 00:24:22,795\ngosh knows what they're doing\nwith your credit card now, right?\n\n496\n00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,475\n>> Oh man, and if you look at Mike's\nscreen shot that he's got up,\n\n497\n00:24:25,475 --> 00:24:27,785\nlook at how legitimate that\nsoftware looks, right?\n\n498\n00:24:27,785 --> 00:24:31,015\nIt looks like it was made by Microsoft.\n\n499\n00:24:31,015 --> 00:24:35,045\nAll the color schemes are right, the fonts\nare right, the buttons are right.\n\n500\n00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:39,850\nEverything about it screams I'm legitimate\nright, and that's how they get you.\n\n501\n00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:42,740\nBecause it does look like\nsoftware that you might\n\n502\n00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,380\nactually have installed on your computer.\n\n503\n00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:47,940\nI know from time to time something\nwill bark at me on my computer, and\n\n504\n00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,660\nit's a legitimate program I just\ndidn't even know existed, and\n\n505\n00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,210\nI did something to make it complain.\n\n506\n00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,800\nAnd then it shows its head, and I go,\noh, I didn't even know that was there,\n\n507\n00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,790\nand it's cool.\n\n508\n00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,240\nThis is how they get you\nwith this type of thing.\n\n509\n00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,730\nSo it looks legitimate, tries to make\nyou think hey, I'm Microsoft approved.\n\n510\n00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,040\nI'm even made by Microsoft.\n\n511\n00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,700\nI might be made by Symantec.\n\n512\n00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,940\nI might be made by\nanother security company.\n\n513\n00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,240\nThey do everything they can to\nmake it look very legitimate, so\n\n514\n00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,360\nthat they can fool you into clicking\nOK apparently I need this software.\n\n515\n00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,950\nNo, no you don't, especially if\nyou're in a corporate environment.\n\n516\n00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:25,140\nI almost guarantee you guys have a\nantivirus solution that you're paying for,\n\n517\n00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,760\nprobably very good money, and\n\n518\n00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,460\nthat your boys in IT are maintaining and\nwatching out for.\n\n519\n00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,380\nSo if something goes wrong they're gonna\nget an email, and they're gonna call you.\n\n520\n00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,120\nThey're gonna say, hey,\nis something going on with your computer?\n\n521\n00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,045\nTrust me, I know,\nI was that guy for a while.\n\n522\n00:25:38,045 --> 00:25:40,098\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that's how it works, and\n\n523\n00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:44,200\nI know when you get a fake AV cuz I get\nan alert and then I'm gonna call you.\n\n524\n00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,310\nI'm like,\nare you getting some weird stuff?\n\n525\n00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,620\nAnd you say, yeah, I am.\n\n526\n00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,600\nDid you click on that?\n\n527\n00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,050\nAnd hopefully you say no, I didn't,\nbecause I didn't know what it was.\n\n528\n00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,670\nThat's the right answer, any time you\ndon't know, just don't click on it.\n\n529\n00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,310\n>> That's the thing as an end-user it's\na good idea to know what you're running.\n\n530\n00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:03,415\nYou should be familiar with what antivirus\nproducts and malware products or\n\n531\n00:26:03,415 --> 00:26:07,550\nanti-malware products they have at your\ncompany so that you can recognize them.\n\n532\n00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:11,410\nBut if you have any doubt just ask\nsomebody, ask somebody that does know.\n\n533\n00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,770\nCall up tech support.\n\n534\n00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,210\nMost companies have a maybe\na web page they can go to or\n\n535\n00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,060\na number you can call to\nsee before you click on it.\n\n536\n00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:22,050\nHey I got this thing that says I've got\nviruses and it wants me to buy this.\n\n537\n00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:25,290\nYou should if you think your company\nis probably not going to expect you\n\n538\n00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,360\nto buy antivirus software in first place,\nright?\n\n539\n00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,180\nIt's a company-provided computer.\n\n540\n00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,086\nSo just check, you know,\nit's better to be safe than sorry.\n\n541\n00:26:32,086 --> 00:26:34,370\nNow Daniel, I wanted to go back for\none second.\n\n542\n00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,640\nWe've talked about all these\ndifferent classes of malware.\n\n543\n00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,490\nLet's take a look at a couple of\nthe programs that we might use to\n\n544\n00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,012\nremove some of this malware.\n\n545\n00:26:43,012 --> 00:26:46,490\nAll right, so what I've got on my screen\nnow is a program called Malwarebytes, and\n\n546\n00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:49,240\nthey've got a free version as\nwell as a pay version and Daniel,\n\n547\n00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,320\nit's probably one of my favorites.\n\n548\n00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,700\nIt's one that I keep on a thumb drive just\nin case somebody needs me to help them\n\n549\n00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,490\nclean their machine,\nand their machine is so\n\n550\n00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:00,340\nhosed that I can't get out to the Internet\nand download it or something like that.\n\n551\n00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,100\nIt does a fantastic job.\n\n552\n00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,040\nNow the scan can take 30 minutes\ndepending on the computer.\n\n553\n00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,640\nIt could take a little while.\n\n554\n00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,640\nSo what I've done is I went ahead and\n\n555\n00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,400\nstarted the scan earlier,\nand I've paused it here.\n\n556\n00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,620\nI'm not gonna let it do the whole scan.\n\n557\n00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,950\nI wanna show you what happened.\n\n558\n00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,760\nSo I can see here, Detected Objects 5.\n\n559\n00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,112\nSo what I'm going to click on\nis this View Identified Threats.\n\n560\n00:27:19,112 --> 00:27:23,228\nI come in here, and these are the things\nthat it found on my system.\n\n561\n00:27:23,228 --> 00:27:28,660\nI say no, one of them is that actual\nkeystroke monitor that I was running,\n\n562\n00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,340\nso I'll click OK to that.\n\n563\n00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,690\nAnd I don't know if it'll\nlet me clear it out,\n\n564\n00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,710\nbecause I didn't actually finish the scan.\n\n565\n00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:38,782\nWhat I should be able to do is come in\nhere and take a look at my Quarantine and\n\n566\n00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:43,020\nit's not gonna show up yet,\nbecause I haven't finished the scan.\n\n567\n00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,450\nOnce that scan finishes, those items\nwould show up here in Quarantine.\n\n568\n00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:49,270\nSo what it's doing is it's grabbing\nthose things and saying hey,\n\n569\n00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,830\nthese match some definition,\nthis is bad stuff.\n\n570\n00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:55,220\nI'm gonna grab it, and I'm not gonna\nlet anything, I'm not gonna let it do\n\n571\n00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,620\nanything, kinda putting it inside\na little bubble, if you will.\n\n572\n00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:03,220\nAnd then what I do is I come in here and I\nsee what it is, I look in the Quarantine.\n\n573\n00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,670\nAnd assuming I want to get rid of\neverything, I choose delete all.\n\n574\n00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,670\nIf it got something that it,\nthat wasn't malware but for\n\n575\n00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:13,350\nsome reason it grabbed,\nI could choose restore to put that back.\n\n576\n00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:17,780\nBut, I'll tell you, I've never had\nany troubles with Malwarebytes\n\n577\n00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,780\nfinding anything or\ntrying to grab legitimate files.\n\n578\n00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,970\n>> Yeah, I've used it heavily and\nextensively throughout my career.\n\n579\n00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:28,530\nIt is hands down one of the, it's a must\nhave in any technician's tool kit.\n\n580\n00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,240\nAnd it's so easy to use.\n\n581\n00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,250\nAnybody can use it's very, very simple,\na wonderful and very intuitive interface.\n\n582\n00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,088\nSo if you want to run it\non your home machine,\n\n583\n00:28:37,088 --> 00:28:38,598\nit shouldn't be much of a problem.\n\n584\n00:28:38,598 --> 00:28:42,492\nYou can get these things from like\ndownload.com or CNET, different places,\n\n585\n00:28:42,492 --> 00:28:46,563\nstraight from their website even if you\nwant, but I think their official portal is\n\n586\n00:28:46,563 --> 00:28:49,910\nfrom download.com, but very,\nvery handy piece of software.\n\n587\n00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,890\nIt's a good thing just to run even if\nyou don't think something's wrong.\n\n588\n00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:56,510\nRun that guy once a month, you know,\njust to check your machine out,\n\n589\n00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:59,610\nbecause it does a really good\njob of rooting out the bad guys.\n\n590\n00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,240\n>> It really does.\n\n591\n00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,800\nThe free version is reactive, where you\nhave to do your scans every so often.\n\n592\n00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,178\nYou can schedule them to run every so\noften.\n\n593\n00:29:08,178 --> 00:29:10,870\nThe pay version will give\nyou proactive protection,\n\n594\n00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,560\nwhere as you download things\nit can look at them and\n\n595\n00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,740\ntry to catch them before it infects your\nmachine, which is always a good thing.\n\n596\n00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,759\n>> Yeah.\n>> So Malwarebytes,\n\n597\n00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:21,045\ngo out there to malware,\nI think it's malwarebytes.org.\n\n598\n00:29:21,045 --> 00:29:22,810\nThey've got a great web site.\n\n599\n00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:24,710\nGet their product and use it.\n\n600\n00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:28,960\nLike I said, I recommend it to all my\nfriends, my family, my mother uses it.\n\n601\n00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,850\nIt's a really good program and\nit keeps us safe.\n\n602\n00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:36,140\nAs you guys saw throughout this episode,\nlots of different types of malware,\n\n603\n00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,580\nlots of ways for\nthe bad guys to get it on your machine.\n\n604\n00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,950\nWe can't stress it enough.\n\n605\n00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,750\nYou've got to try to keep yourself safe.\n\n606\n00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,090\nThat means using good practices,\n\n607\n00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:49,695\nnot clicking on things from people that\nyou don't trust, and running programs like\n\n608\n00:29:49,695 --> 00:29:53,510\nMalwarebytes to scan my machine to make\nsure there's nothing that slipped by.\n\n609\n00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,470\n>> That's right.\n\n610\n00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,230\nAll right,\nMike I think we've gone through the gamut,\n\n611\n00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,410\nas it were of different types of malware.\n\n612\n00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,430\nThere's a lot of it out there but\n\n613\n00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:05,760\nhopefully after this episode you're\na little bit demystified by it by now.\n\n614\n00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,330\nIt's very, very easy for\n\n615\n00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,645\nyou to see what is bad because it\ndoes things that you don't like.\n\n616\n00:30:10,645 --> 00:30:12,985\nThat being said,\nit's time to sign off from ITProTV.\n\n617\n00:30:12,985 --> 00:30:15,005\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n618\n00:30:15,005 --> 00:30:15,775\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n619\n00:30:15,775 --> 00:30:17,880\n>> And we'll

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,920\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\ntoday with me is Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,740\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,660\n>> I'm doing fantastic,\n\n7\n00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,080\nDon, we're getting ready to do another\nepisode of our security fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,730\nAnd in this episode we're gonna talk about\nsomething known as social engineering.\n\n9\n00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,555\nIt's one of these terms that you've\nprobably heard about in the news or\n\n10\n00:00:29,555 --> 00:00:33,842\nread about in some articles about these\nsecurity breaches that have occurred.\n\n11\n00:00:33,842 --> 00:00:36,012\nAnd we're gonna take a look\nat what it actually mean,\n\n12\n00:00:36,012 --> 00:00:38,990\nwhat are they talking about,\nthis social engineering?\n\n13\n00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:39,660\n>> Yeah, it is.\n\n14\n00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,790\nIt is a security buzzword,\nyou hear about it a lot, and\n\n15\n00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,494\nit's one of those terms that doesn't\nmean just one specific type of attack.\n\n16\n00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:49,120\nIt's actually a number of different\nmethods that we can use or\n\n17\n00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,520\ntrying to to pull off\na social engineering attack.\n\n18\n00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,680\nBut they all share a common element and\nthe common element is the target.\n\n19\n00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,580\nThe target is a person.\n\n20\n00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,140\nWe as human beings are often the weakest\nlink in a security structure, right Mike?\n\n21\n00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:02,990\n>> We really are.\n\n22\n00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:06,140\nThis is one of the attacks that that\ndoesn't even have to take advantage of\n\n23\n00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,970\nthe technology.\n\n24\n00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,912\nAs Don said,\nit's taking advantage of human nature.\n\n25\n00:01:09,912 --> 00:01:13,175\nWhen we talk about social engineering,\nwe're not attacking the system,\n\n26\n00:01:13,175 --> 00:01:15,705\nwe're attacking the person\nbehind the system.\n\n27\n00:01:15,705 --> 00:01:20,255\nAnd it's really very simple to do,\nyou see this done a lot,\n\n28\n00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:23,780\nand it's a relatively\neasy attack to carry off.\n\n29\n00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,820\nAnd it's because of the way humans are,\nthe way we behave.\n\n30\n00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:33,050\nHumans have this desire to be liked,\nthey want their friends to like them.\n\n31\n00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,030\nThey want to be recognized\namong their peers.\n\n32\n00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,210\nThey want to make sure they\nshow respect for authority.\n\n33\n00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,990\nSomebody in authority comes and\n\n34\n00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,360\nask you a question you typically\nrespond in the appropriate way.\n\n35\n00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,490\nYou're like, oh, this is my boss or\nthis is somebody that demands respect.\n\n36\n00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,880\nI'm gonna respond to them in that way.\n\n37\n00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,100\nOr just to prove knowledge.\n\n38\n00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,620\nA lot of times it's taking\nadvantage of people that\n\n39\n00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,990\nwant to show off how much they know.\n\n40\n00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,450\nSo we're talking about attacking\nthe system with social engineering.\n\n41\n00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,130\nWe're really focusing on the human aspect.\n\n42\n00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,460\nAnd that's one of the things that makes\nit so difficult for as network admins to\n\n43\n00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,460\nprotect against is because it's not\nsomething I could just apply a patch to.\n\n44\n00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,902\nI can't download Human 2.0 and\nrun that and\n\n45\n00:02:13,902 --> 00:02:16,760\nprotect myself against social engineering.\n\n46\n00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,464\nWell, social engineering in a nutshell, as\nDon said, it's kind of an umbrella term.\n\n47\n00:02:19,464 --> 00:02:21,792\nIt covers a lot of different\navenues of attack, but\n\n48\n00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,850\nthey all have that one thing in common.\n\n49\n00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,470\nWe're attacking the human\ninstead of the system.\n\n50\n00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,360\n>> And we're gonna talk a little\nmore about it later, but\n\n51\n00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,360\nthe only solution to social engineering\nis awareness, right, is making sure that\n\n52\n00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,150\nour end users recognize that a social\nengineering attack is happening.\n\n53\n00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,122\nAnd that's basically what we're\ngonna do here in this episode.\n\n54\n00:02:42,122 --> 00:02:45,955\nWe're gonna show you guys examples of the\ndifferent styles of a social engineering\n\n55\n00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:49,841\nattack, the way it can occur, so that you\ncan recognize that when that's happening\n\n56\n00:02:49,841 --> 00:02:53,123\nand you can say, wait a minute,\nI don't need to answer that question or\n\n57\n00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:55,298\nthis is not the way this\nis supposed to happen.\n\n58\n00:02:55,298 --> 00:02:58,120\nI'm not gonna divulge my\npassword to these people\n\n59\n00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,610\nbecause you've recognized what's going on.\n\n60\n00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,480\nSo that it all comes down to awareness.\n\n61\n00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,620\n>> Exactly.\n\n62\n00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,480\nSo one of the first sign of a social\nengineering we want to talk about like I\n\n63\n00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,020\nsaid there are several different kinds.\n\n64\n00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,310\nThe first one is pretexting and\nthis is a very common one.\n\n65\n00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,430\nPretexting really means\nmaking up a fake scenario or\n\n66\n00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,460\nan elaborate story or lie to try\nto get information out of people.\n\n67\n00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,730\nAn example might be,\nlet's say I call somebody up,\n\n68\n00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,412\nmaybe they work at the front desk or\nthey're some employee at a company.\n\n69\n00:03:27,412 --> 00:03:29,840\nI'm gonna call him up and\nI'm going to do some name dropping.\n\n70\n00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,950\nI could have gotten these names maybe\noff of a web site or maybe in response\n\n71\n00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,700\nto an e-mail and I get the names of some\nof your I.T. people at your company.\n\n72\n00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,670\nAnd then I'm gonna call this company up,\ncall any employee from that company,\n\n73\n00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:43,710\nand I'm gonna say, hey look,\nthis is Bob in IT, and\n\n74\n00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,780\nwe're going through an upgrade\non their database application.\n\n75\n00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,330\nAnd I need to make sure that when\nwe reset it on Monday morning,\n\n76\n00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,020\nyou still have access to it.\n\n77\n00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,150\nSo I need to get your password from you.\n\n78\n00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,380\nAnd a lot, you'd be surprised how many\nemployees will actually fork over their\n\n79\n00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,860\npassword because they think it's\nsomething that they need to do, right?\n\n80\n00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,890\nThey don't want to be the only one on\nMonday morning that can't access that\n\n81\n00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,740\ndatabase.\n\n82\n00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,890\nIt's Bob from I.T.\n\n83\n00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:11,080\nI know I've seen that name on letterhead\nor on some e-mails or things like that.\n\n84\n00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,570\nSo I'm pretty sure this\nis the guy from IT.\n\n85\n00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,490\nWhy would anybody else call me about that?\n\n86\n00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,560\nSo they just fork it right over.\n\n87\n00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,943\nThey share that information.\n\n88\n00:04:16,943 --> 00:04:18,850\nBut it wasn't Bob from IT, right?\n\n89\n00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,570\nIt was me.\n\n90\n00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,970\nI just called up and\npretended to be somebody else.\n\n91\n00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,600\nIf you guys probably heard\nof some named Kevin Mitnick,\n\n92\n00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,960\nthis is one of the famous hackers.\n\n93\n00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,090\nHe's one of the first hackers that\nwas really prosecuted by the F.B.I.\n\n94\n00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,060\nand he's done a lot of different attacks.\n\n95\n00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,500\nAnd I watched a really interesting\ninterview with him after he got released\n\n96\n00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,900\nfrom prison and the guy asked him,\nwhat attack were you most proud of?\n\n97\n00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,840\nAnd being politically correct, he says,\n\n98\n00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,860\nwell I'm not really proud\nof any of my attacks.\n\n99\n00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,090\nBut the one that surprised me\nthe most was when he called up,\n\n100\n00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,590\nI believe it was Nokia at the time,\nhe called them up and\n\n101\n00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,880\nwas able to get the source code for\na new phone they were working on.\n\n102\n00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,350\nAll by just calling them up on the phone,\ndropping the right names,\n\n103\n00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,740\ntalking the right talk.\n\n104\n00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,700\nand was able to get them to\nsend that information to him.\n\n105\n00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,710\n>> Another great example of pretexting\nis what's called a 419 scam.\n\n106\n00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,820\n419 scams have been around a long time, a\nlot of people think of them as emails, but\n\n107\n00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,260\nthey actually started back in\nthe day as mailed letters.\n\n108\n00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,280\nYou'd get a letter and\nit would have a big story in there.\n\n109\n00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,000\nSomebody, usually an attorney,\nwas contacting you, and they represent\n\n110\n00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,860\nAfrican royalty or an ambassador or\nsomebody like that, and basically\n\n111\n00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,330\nthey're telling you a story and I've got\na great example right here on my computer.\n\n112\n00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,550\nSo this is a photocopy of a letter and\nbasically it's just sending a message\n\n113\n00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,575\nto you and letting you know this person\nsaying they're in the United Kingdom,\n\n114\n00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:45,460\nthey visited South Africa, and\nsomething happened, right?\n\n115\n00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:50,990\nThere's a person, this person,\nMutassim Billah Gadhafi, who has died.\n\n116\n00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,380\nAnd their money is tied up in an estate,\nand they wanna transfer it out,\n\n117\n00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,040\nbut they don't want to pay a bunch\nof taxes or something like that,\n\n118\n00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,000\nin this case it's 32 million pounds.\n\n119\n00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,280\nAnd what they say is, if you let me\ntransfer the 32 million pounds to you,\n\n120\n00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,370\nthen you can transfer it\nback to another account for\n\n121\n00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,620\nme, and keep a million pounds for\nyourself, right?\n\n122\n00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,280\nKeep some of the money yourself, and\nyou make money, I get the money out.\n\n123\n00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,030\nAnd see here, it's saying they don't want\nit to be forfeited to the government\n\n124\n00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,860\ntreasury, please respond immediately,\nblah blah blah.\n\n125\n00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,870\nAnd here they're saying\nyou can get 35% of that,\n\n126\n00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,830\nwell that's actually\nseveral million pounds.\n\n127\n00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,070\nAnd so if you look at that you think man,\nthat's a great deal and\n\n128\n00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,300\nall I have to do is transfer some money,\nwhat's the risk?\n\n129\n00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,920\nThey're gonna give me 35 million and\nI just give back 30 million pounds.\n\n130\n00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,240\nWell there's two risks here,\n\n131\n00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,190\nrisk number one is you've gotta\ngive them your bank account.\n\n132\n00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:44,590\nSo you're giving them personally\nidentifiable information, data about you.\n\n133\n00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,710\nSecondly, if they transfer you 35 million,\nthey send you a check,\n\n134\n00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,800\nthat's check's gonna bounce.\n\n135\n00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,700\nBut if you turn around and you write\na check back to them for any small amount,\n\n136\n00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,400\nthen that may clear, and\nnow they get that money.\n\n137\n00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,570\nSo this is an outright scam.\n\n138\n00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,830\nBut they have this elaborate story behind,\n\n139\n00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,070\nthat pretexting,\nthat makes people want to believe.\n\n140\n00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,710\n>> Absolutely.\n\n141\n00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,020\nYou get so wrapped up in the story\nthat you forget to think about what\n\n142\n00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,030\nare the odds of this actually being true?\n\n143\n00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,330\nLike holy crap, here's a chance for\nme to get a chunk of money for\n\n144\n00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,290\nreally basically doing nothing, and\n\n145\n00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:21,060\nyou'd be surprised how many people\nactually fall for this nowadays.\n\n146\n00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,860\nIt is amazing.\n\n147\n00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,330\nSo pretexting really all\nabout that elaborate lie,\n\n148\n00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:29,510\nthat big story, wrapping up this thing and\nthis elaborate scam.\n\n149\n00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,390\nAnd then taking advantage of human nature.\n\n150\n00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,410\nAnother type of social engineering that\nwe want to talk about is phishing.\n\n151\n00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,945\nThis is one that I'm sure I'm sure\nyou've seen in the news recently,\n\n152\n00:07:40,945 --> 00:07:42,235\nread some articles about.\n\n153\n00:07:42,235 --> 00:07:43,800\nIt's a very common one.\n\n154\n00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,145\nIt typically occurs via e-mail but\nit could be via IM,\n\n155\n00:07:47,145 --> 00:07:51,245\ninstant messaging, as well as a couple\nof the different methods we could use.\n\n156\n00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:53,525\nBut it's all about sending you an e-mail.\n\n157\n00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:55,245\nLet's say you get an e-mail,\nfrom say, PayPal.\n\n158\n00:07:55,245 --> 00:07:58,465\nAnd it says hey,\nyour PayPal account requires attention.\n\n159\n00:07:58,465 --> 00:08:01,865\nWe need you to log in in\norder to fix your account.\n\n160\n00:08:01,865 --> 00:08:05,543\nAnd they give you a handy link right\nthere in the email to click on, and\n\n161\n00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:08,525\nyou click on that link and\na browser window opens up, and\n\n162\n00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:11,320\nsure enough there's my\nPay Pal log on screen.\n\n163\n00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,396\nSo I type in my username and password,\nand I click enter, and nothing happens.\n\n164\n00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:17,856\nAnd I wonder what do most people\ngonna do when that happens?\n\n165\n00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:21,105\nIf I type in my user name and password and\nnothing happens, what do I do?\n\n166\n00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:21,828\n>> Put it in again.\n[LAUGH]\n\n167\n00:08:21,828 --> 00:08:24,635\n>> [LAUGH] Absolutely, something must have\n\n168\n00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:27,685\nbeen wrong, maybe I typed it in wrong,\nmaybe I didn't actually click Enter.\n\n169\n00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:29,945\nSo I'm gonna type it in again,\nand click Enter one more time,\n\n170\n00:08:29,945 --> 00:08:31,850\nand it still doesn't work.\n\n171\n00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,270\nAnd the reason it's not working and\n\n172\n00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,770\nthe reason it's never gonna work,\nthat's not actually PayPal's site.\n\n173\n00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,920\nWhat you just did is gave some\nbad guy your username and\n\n174\n00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,990\npassword to your PayPal account.\n\n175\n00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,080\nThis is a very common thing.\n\n176\n00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,670\nWhat happens, that link is not actually\npointing to PayPal servers, and\n\n177\n00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,040\nthey can make it very difficult.\n\n178\n00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,490\nThey try to hide it within that link.\n\n179\n00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,804\nIt looks like it goes to PayPal, and\nI click on it and a web page opens up, and\n\n180\n00:08:55,804 --> 00:08:57,480\nit looks just like PayPal.\n\n181\n00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,230\nThat's what phishing is all about.\n\n182\n00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,040\nThey're gonna host on their web\nserver something that looks very\n\n183\n00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,500\nsimilar to PayPal, waiting for you to come\nthere, type in username and password, and\n\n184\n00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,490\nthere you're gonna click on that and\ngive them your information.\n\n185\n00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,230\n>> Yeah, and this is an extremely\ncommon type of attack.\n\n186\n00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,700\nI would be shocked if there were any\nof you viewers out there right now that\n\n187\n00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,590\nhaven't gotten at least one of\nthese phishing e-mails over time.\n\n188\n00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:23,340\nA lot of times our spam filter catches\nthem, but they're really prevalent.\n\n189\n00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,520\nCornell University,\nthey do a really cool thing,\n\n190\n00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,170\nthey have what's called their fishbowl\nwhere they post any phishing emails that\n\n191\n00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,820\nspread through the university as a way to\ninform their students and staff about it.\n\n192\n00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,375\nSo I've got their page pulled up where\nthey have a just a ton of examples,\n\n193\n00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:40,338\nsome from just a few days ago, but they go\nback years with all these different ones\n\n194\n00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:44,648\nthat have passed, they go all the way back\nto 2010, and if you look at some of these,\n\n195\n00:09:44,648 --> 00:09:46,460\nthey're fairly simple e-mails.\n\n196\n00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:52,070\nI'll just take this latest one, the\nsubject line, school mailbox validation,\n\n197\n00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,720\nand if you open the email, it says it has\nbeen our pleasure to provide you with\n\n198\n00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,240\na campus login and\ne-mail account in the past.\n\n199\n00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,250\nPlease be advised that effective May 30th,\n2015,\n\n200\n00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,240\nwe will be deleting accounts who\naccount has not been validated yet.\n\n201\n00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,450\nPlease validate.\n\n202\n00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,640\nClick this link.\n\n203\n00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,120\nPlease make arrangements to\nmove valued e-mail messages to\n\n204\n00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,940\nanother e-mail account before the above\ndate, as all messages will be deleted\n\n205\n00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,620\nalong with the accounts at\nthe time if you no longer need it.\n\n206\n00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,910\nThank you for your attention.\n\n207\n00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,540\nLook at the threat there.\n\n208\n00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,400\nYou need to validate your email by this\ndate, or we delete all your email.\n\n209\n00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,660\nUsers see that, and they panic.\n\n210\n00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,770\nI don't wanna lose all my email.\n\n211\n00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,270\nI better go validate.\n\n212\n00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,070\n>> Absolutely, that's the first thing,\nthey're gonna click on that link, and\n\n213\n00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,635\nthey're gonna try to\nupdate that information.\n\n214\n00:10:33,635 --> 00:10:35,467\nCuz, God forbid,\nthey lose all their e-mails.\n\n215\n00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:37,880\n>> Yeah.\n>> This is what phishing is all about, and\n\n216\n00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,830\nwhat we have to understand is that,\nour bank accounts, or PayPal, or\n\n217\n00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,880\nschool like this, they're never gonna\nask us for this kind of information.\n\n218\n00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,560\nIf you don't trust the e-mail,\nif you suspect that\n\n219\n00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,400\nthere could be something wrong with\nthat link, don't click on it, right?\n\n220\n00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,260\nAll you have to do is if I get a link like\nthat from Bank of America that says hey,\n\n221\n00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:00,470\nmy account is needs to be updated, click\non this link to update your information.\n\n222\n00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,310\nAll I'm going to do simply\nminimize my e-mail.\n\n223\n00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:08,892\nOpen up a separate browser, navigate\nmyself to Bank of America and log in.\n\n224\n00:11:08,892 --> 00:11:10,880\nThere's gonna be a message\nthere waiting for me, right,\n\n225\n00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,520\ntelling me that there's information\nthat needs to be updated, or\n\n226\n00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,600\nmaybe there's not because\nit was a complete scam.\n\n227\n00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,310\n>> I've seen some really advanced ones,\ntoo, ones where you click on the link to\n\n228\n00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:23,470\nvalidate and it says put in your email\naddress and password, and you punch that\n\n229\n00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:27,270\nin, and when you hit that button, instead\nof nothing happening, it'll take you to\n\n230\n00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,280\nanother screen, and it'll say we need\nto verify your private question.\n\n231\n00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,990\nAnd they'll list like three or\nfour questions, mother's maiden name,\n\n232\n00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,800\nfirst pet name, and whatever you put in\nthere they're just storing it because they\n\n233\n00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,870\nknow now they've got even more if they\nwanna reset your passwords or whatever.\n\n234\n00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,890\nThis stuff, it gets out,\nand it's a real weakness.\n\n235\n00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,160\nSo when you open up an email,\n\n236\n00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,950\nwe need to be able to verify that it is\nfrom who it says it is, and unfortunately\n\n237\n00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,540\nwith email there's no official\ngenerally accepted way to do that.\n\n238\n00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,630\nThere's digital email signatures and\n\n239\n00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,240\nother technologies, but\nnot everyone supports those.\n\n240\n00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,080\nSo oftentimes, you can't trust that\nan email comes from who says it is, and\n\n241\n00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,280\nyou do exactly what Mike said.\n\n242\n00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,070\nGo right to that person's website so\n\n243\n00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,270\nyou know how you got there,\nnot following a link in the email.\n\n244\n00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:15,090\n>> Exactly, most of these organizations\nknow, they know about these scams, right?\n\n245\n00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,720\nThey're not gonna, Bank of America's\nnever gonna send me an email\n\n246\n00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,760\nthat says click on this link, and\nhave it take me to my account.\n\n247\n00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,100\nThey're not gonna do that because\nthey know about these scams.\n\n248\n00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,240\nSo, don't trust in them.\n\n249\n00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,020\nIf you don't trust them,\nsimply don't click on the links.\n\n250\n00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,950\nThat's how you avoid that.\n\n251\n00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:34,530\nAnother type of social engineering that\nwe see often is something called baiting.\n\n252\n00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,270\nBaiting is another very easy one to do.\n\n253\n00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,020\nAnd it's taking advantage\nagain of human nature.\n\n254\n00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,370\nIt's our curiosity this\ntime that they're after.\n\n255\n00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,980\nBaiting simply means I'm gonna\ntake some kind of physical media.\n\n256\n00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,350\nA common one nowadays\nas a USB thumb drive,\n\n257\n00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,380\nit used to be more on CDs and\nDVDs and things like that.\n\n258\n00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,870\nBut you're gonna put, the bad guys,\n\n259\n00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,020\nwhat they do they're gonna load\nthose things with malware.\n\n260\n00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,020\nThings that'll infect your computer as\nsoon as you plug it into that DVD drive,\n\n261\n00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,010\nit auto plays, and\n\n262\n00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,130\nit runs that boot sector, and\nit's gonna infect your computer.\n\n263\n00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,700\nSame thing with these USB drives and\n\n264\n00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,370\nthese thumb drives, what they do is\nthey throw them out the parking lot.\n\n265\n00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,770\nThey drop them in the lobby.\n\n266\n00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,010\nThey walk through the building, and they\njust kinda drop it in the lobby there.\n\n267\n00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,180\nAnd maybe it's a thumb drive that\nhas a company logo on there, or\n\n268\n00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,060\nmaybe it's a DVD that somebody's written\non the top there, payroll information, or\n\n269\n00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,660\nsomething like that, and when somebody\npicks that up what are they gonna do?\n\n270\n00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,520\nThey're gonna go and\nput it in their computer, right?\n\n271\n00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,170\nAnd now all of a sudden\nthey're gonna be infected,\n\n272\n00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,590\nthat computer is now calling home, and\nthe bad guy has access to your network.\n\n273\n00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:41,310\nI've read about some studies done, where\nthey've done at a financial institution.\n\n274\n00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:45,370\nThey took like 20 thumb drives, and they\nscattered in various areas, the lobby,\n\n275\n00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,028\nthe parking lot, the bathrooms.\n\n276\n00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:52,360\nAnd I wanna say it was about\n17 of the 20 thumb drives got\n\n277\n00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,520\nplugged into the work network, all right.\n\n278\n00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,796\nAs if people finding a thumb drive that\nthey have no idea where it came from or\n\n279\n00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,500\nwhat's on it, and they're just like,\nhm, let's see, and\n\n280\n00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,380\nplugging it in their computer.\n\n281\n00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,030\n>> Yeah, that's preying on\npeople's curiosity, right?\n\n282\n00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,708\nPeople are curious,\nthey wanna know what's on that drive.\n\n283\n00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:10,320\nThey just wanna take a look and\nplug it in, and they're vulnerable.\n\n284\n00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,120\nThe next one we're going to talk about is\ntailgating, and whereas baiting kind of\n\n285\n00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,162\npreyed on your curiosity, tailgating preys\non you being nice to people, right Mike?\n\n286\n00:14:20,162 --> 00:14:22,970\n>> It absolutely does, and\nthis is another very common one,\n\n287\n00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,140\na very easy one to pull off.\n\n288\n00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,080\nA lot of organizations now, you know\nwe're taking security more seriously, and\n\n289\n00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,350\nwill use different entry\nway security devices.\n\n290\n00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,151\nLike a key fobs that we use here.\n\n291\n00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:37,970\nWhere I've got a little RFID that I can\nhold up to the keypad next to the door,\n\n292\n00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,880\nand that's gonna unlock the door, or\n\n293\n00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,750\nmaybe there's a code you have to punch\nin there to get inside that door.\n\n294\n00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:47,525\nSo as a bad guy I,\nI can't get in, or can I?\n\n295\n00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:51,365\nAll I have to do is wait for\nsomebody else to open that door for\n\n296\n00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:54,165\nme and then slip on in right behind them.\n\n297\n00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:56,605\nSometimes they might not notice,\nI might be able to slip in, and\n\n298\n00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,295\nthey're not even paying attention.\n\n299\n00:14:58,295 --> 00:15:01,055\nOther times I might have to\nget a little more creative.\n\n300\n00:15:01,055 --> 00:15:02,355\nOne of the ways I might do this,\n\n301\n00:15:02,355 --> 00:15:05,895\nI might wait until I see some\npeople coming back from lunch.\n\n302\n00:15:05,895 --> 00:15:09,490\nI've got a group of people getting out of\ntheir car, getting ready to come back up.\n\n303\n00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,120\nWell before they get up to\nthat front door, I'm gonna\n\n304\n00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,660\nwalk up to that front door, and maybe\nI've got a stack of boxes in my hand, and\n\n305\n00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,500\nI act like I'm trying to reach into my\npocket and pull my card out without\n\n306\n00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,420\ndropping this stack of boxes, and Don,\nwhat are those people going to do for me?\n\n307\n00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,760\n>> Say here, let me get the door for you.\n\n308\n00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,300\nAnd they open and hold the door, and they\njust let you walk right in front of them.\n\n309\n00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,540\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n310\n00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,552\nThis is what we do, so\nthat tailgating in it.\n\n311\n00:15:31,552 --> 00:15:34,112\nAnd again, it's taking advantage\nof human nature right?\n\n312\n00:15:34,112 --> 00:15:38,190\nWe wanna be nice, we see somebody in need,\nthey're having trouble with the door,\n\n313\n00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,270\nI'm going to go ahead and\nopen the door for him.\n\n314\n00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,480\nHow can that be a bad thing?\n\n315\n00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,300\nBut now that that person's inside\nthe building, they've bypassed your,\n\n316\n00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,070\none of your layers of physical security,\nand you're not watching them.\n\n317\n00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,729\nYou let them in, and\nnow you're running off to your office or\n\n318\n00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:54,250\nhitting the bathroom or\nwhatever, what are they doing?\n\n319\n00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,197\nThey're sneaking into a conference room\nwhere they can try to plug into one of\n\n320\n00:15:58,197 --> 00:16:00,330\nthe ports in the wall, or who knows what.\n\n321\n00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,700\nSo that's tailgating, taking advantage\nof people trying to be nice.\n\n322\n00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,190\n>> Another one that's out\nthere is shoulder surfing.\n\n323\n00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,540\nAnd shoulder surfing is one\nthat is really responsible for\n\n324\n00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,640\na lot of people getting into computers.\n\n325\n00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,340\nWhen you use your computer, people could\nbe standing right behind you, looking and\n\n326\n00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,070\nseeing that screen.\n\n327\n00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,280\nOr just walking by, or\n\n328\n00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,580\nmaybe you're not even at your desk,\nthey're just kind of looking at it.\n\n329\n00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,120\nBut shoulder surfing is that act\nof somebody just looking over and\n\n330\n00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,070\nseeing what you're doing.\n\n331\n00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,800\nSeeing you type that password in, or\nwhatever it is that you are working on.\n\n332\n00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,250\nAnd they get that information,\nstanding right there in plain sight.\n\n333\n00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,570\n>> Absolutely, if somebody's standing\nbehind you watching you type,\n\n334\n00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,400\nthey're gonna see what you're typing.\n\n335\n00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,560\nThey don't need to break your password,\nyou just gave it to them.\n\n336\n00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,630\nAnd you see this, and not only on your\ncomputers, but I see it nowadays.\n\n337\n00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,120\nAnd everywhere we go,\nwe like to use our debit cards and\n\n338\n00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,970\nour credit cards to pay for things.\n\n339\n00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,280\nThe same thing's happening on those little\nreaders that you have to punch in your\n\n340\n00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,020\nPIN number for, or your PIN for.\n\n341\n00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,240\nSome of them nowadays have the little\nshield that goes over them\n\n342\n00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,330\nto give you a little protection.\n\n343\n00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,710\nI've been in some places where\nthere's no shielding on it at all, and\n\n344\n00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,360\nthe cashier's just staring at the keypad.\n\n345\n00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,600\nAnd I know he's not trying to get my\nnumber, he's waiting for me to finish so\n\n346\n00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,450\nyou can hit his little\nbutton on the register.\n\n347\n00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,890\nBut I just stare right back at him, and\neventually, they'll get the hint, and\n\n348\n00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,080\nthey'll look away.\n\n349\n00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:21,970\nBut you got people behind you, and they're\non their phone, right, or are they?\n\n350\n00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,960\nTaking pictures, shooting a video,\nwatching you punch that in.\n\n351\n00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,600\nAnd on your computer system at work,\nsame thing.\n\n352\n00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,100\nSomebody could be acting like\nthey're talking on the phone,\n\n353\n00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,930\nand they're actually recording what\nyou're doing, or simply just watching.\n\n354\n00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,480\nToday's computers, Don,\nthe whole big thing is oh,\n\n355\n00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,260\nit's got this great field of vision,\nyou can see that screen from any angle.\n\n356\n00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,020\nThat's not really the best thing, is it?\n\n357\n00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,660\n>> No, if you're sitting on an airplane\nand you're working on your laptop and\n\n358\n00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,980\nyou have a passenger on your left, and\n\n359\n00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,510\na passenger on your right,\nthey can both see your computer screen.\n\n360\n00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,702\nAnd it's-\n>> I've watched some good movies that way.\n\n361\n00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:52,860\n>> [LAUGH] You can go I'm\nnot gonna pay that $5.\n\n362\n00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,400\nSo it's a problem, enough problem,\n\n363\n00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,680\nthat they actually sell privacy screen\nguards you can put on your monitor.\n\n364\n00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,000\nThese are little polarized filters.\n\n365\n00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,560\nI've got one pulled up\nhere on Amazon's website.\n\n366\n00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,630\nAnd [COUGH] it's just a film\nthat you stick on your monitor.\n\n367\n00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,940\nAnd if you're looking straight on at\nyour computer, you see like normal,\n\n368\n00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,430\nthere's no difference, but if you're\nlooking at an angle it's polarized,\n\n369\n00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,890\nit's got these little,\nwhat are they called?\n\n370\n00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,190\n>> Like a honey comb or a-\n>> Yeah, it's a little bevel or\n\n371\n00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,360\nsomething like that,\nit's inside of the material.\n\n372\n00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,460\nSo when you, a louver,\nthat's what it's actually called,\n\n373\n00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,880\nthey're these little blades, almost.\n\n374\n00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,300\nAnd when you look at it from an angle,\n\n375\n00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,290\nyou're seeing the sides of those louvers\nand this will make it looks gold.\n\n376\n00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,350\nI've had one before that\nmade it just black.\n\n377\n00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,840\nSo somebody sitting beside you, it would\nlook like your computer was turned off.\n\n378\n00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,390\nBut if you're looking dead on you can see\nit just fine, from an angle you can't.\n\n379\n00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:47,500\nThis takes away that amazing field of\nvision that they charge extra for on TVs,\n\n380\n00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,840\nwe don't necessarily want that\non our laptops and desktops.\n\n381\n00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,500\nNow, somebody could still stand\ndirectly behind me and see, so\n\n382\n00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,030\nthis isn't foolproof.\n\n383\n00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,720\nYou need to be aware of\npeople around you and\n\n384\n00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,130\nnot be doing sensitive activities while\nyou're in an area that's not controlled.\n\n385\n00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,930\n>> Yeah, I mean don't be scared\nto say something to somebody,\n\n386\n00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:08,350\nif somebody is standing\nright over your computer.\n\n387\n00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,350\nEven if it's the IT guy at work and\n\n388\n00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,330\nhe's come up there to help\nyou fix your computer.\n\n389\n00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,800\nSo he says hey, can you go ahead and\nlog into the system real quick, and\n\n390\n00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,760\nI'll take a look at what the problem is.\n\n391\n00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,180\nDon't type your password in,\nI mean ask him to turn away.\n\n392\n00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,900\nSay hey, look give me a second and I'll\nlog in, or say do you mind turning away?\n\n393\n00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,650\nThere's nothing wrong with that,\ndon't be embarrassed, don't be scared.\n\n394\n00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,880\nYou're protecting, in fact,\nhe should respect you for that.\n\n395\n00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,220\nThat IT person should say dang,\n\n396\n00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,660\nthis person is actually\npaying attention to security.\n\n397\n00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,580\nAnd they know about some of these\ndifferent types of attacks, and\n\n398\n00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,350\nthey should not have\na problem looking away.\n\n399\n00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,000\n>> Now, our last one,\nour last one is the dirtiest one and\n\n400\n00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,230\nI don't mean like sneaky or rude or\nwhatever, I mean it's actually filthy.\n\n401\n00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,930\nIt's a, it's dumpster diving.\n\n402\n00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,030\n>> I was going to pull up\nan image of the guy kind of,\n\n403\n00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,580\nin a dumpster with his little\nlegs sticking out or something,\n\n404\n00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,930\nbut dumpster diving is a very\ncommon one and you'd be surprised\n\n405\n00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:01,350\nhow much information the bad guys\ncan gain by doing dumpster diving.\n\n406\n00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,520\nAnd dumpster diving, it's actually,\nthat's an accurate description,\n\n407\n00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,510\ntheir people are going into\nthe trash receptacles.\n\n408\n00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,350\nIn different countries, I think they\ncall it skips or skippers over there in\n\n409\n00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:15,390\nEngland, there's different names for\nit in different places.\n\n410\n00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,920\nBut we throw a lot of stuff away,\nand a lot of times,\n\n411\n00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,660\nwe're not real conscientious\nabout what we're throwing away.\n\n412\n00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,420\nSecurity documents that say top\nsecret across the top of it.\n\n413\n00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,110\nThat have important information on there.\n\n414\n00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:31,860\nWe think about that, we put it in that\nspecial trash can or we shred it.\n\n415\n00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,300\nA lot of times what we see\nthough is Post-it notes.\n\n416\n00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,060\nWhere you've taken\na message on the phone and\n\n417\n00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,210\nyou write somebody's account number down.\n\n418\n00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,640\nOr something that you've got\nto get into later on, and\n\n419\n00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,000\nyou stick it on your computer.\n\n420\n00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,780\nAnd then a few minutes\nlater you get to it,\n\n421\n00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,230\nyou take that Post-it note and\nyou throw it away.\n\n422\n00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:50,530\nOr what about the big one I like is the\nblotter, the pound of desk pad calendars,\n\n423\n00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,590\nright, that sit on your desk,\nyou just tear that month off and\n\n424\n00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,800\nyou throw in the trash.\n\n425\n00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,010\nThink about all the notes you've\nwritten on that over the month, or\n\n426\n00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:01,370\nhas all those ones you roll over at\nthe end of the years always a good time\n\n427\n00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,620\nbecause they're swapping\nout their counters, right?\n\n428\n00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,860\nThey're getting a new calendar for\nthe new year.\n\n429\n00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,940\nOr those little ones that flip\nover page by page, same thing.\n\n430\n00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,500\nThey're just dumping the old one in\nthe garbage and then putting a new one in\n\n431\n00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,370\nplace, and the bad guy just has to go\nout there and get it out of the garbage.\n\n432\n00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,590\nYou can get passwords,\nyou can get all kinds of things.\n\n433\n00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,240\nNot the nicest thing to do, I suppose.\n\n434\n00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,140\nIt can get a little dirty.\n\n435\n00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,760\nIf there's a restaurant sharing\nthe same dumpster as the organization\n\n436\n00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,800\ntrying to attack.\n\n437\n00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:32,860\nBut very common, I've heard stories\nwhere big time companies have paid,\n\n438\n00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,440\ngotten person a job at a different company\nas a janitor just for that very fact.\n\n439\n00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,985\nThey want that janitor if they\ntold him what offices to get, and\n\n440\n00:21:40,985 --> 00:21:45,805\nwhen he empties those trash cans in those\noffices, he keeps the certain ones, right?\n\n441\n00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,535\nJust another example of that dumpster\ndiving is going through the trash,\n\n442\n00:21:49,535 --> 00:21:53,000\ngetting information because people don't\nthink about what they're throwing away.\n\n443\n00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,610\n>> Yeah, and\nlook let's kick it up a notch, Mike.\n\n444\n00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:57,600\nWhat about when companies have old\ncomputers they don't need anymore or\n\n445\n00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,820\nold servers they decommissioned and\nthey throw those away.\n\n446\n00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,090\nIf you just throw them in the regular\ntrash, somebody could get that computer\n\n447\n00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,130\nout of the trash and\nwho knows what data's inside.\n\n448\n00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,280\nIt's a data trove,\n\n449\n00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,950\nyou know tons of information that's\non there that they can get at.\n\n450\n00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:09,700\nDefinitely a problem.\n\n451\n00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,780\nBe sensitive to the information\nyou throw away.\n\n452\n00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,650\n>> And those are really just\na few of the difference.\n\n453\n00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,920\nThere are some other types\nof social engineering.\n\n454\n00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,450\nThose are the main ones that\nyou're going to run into.\n\n455\n00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,270\nNow, the problem I think we mentioned\nat the beginning of the show.\n\n456\n00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,530\nThe problem with social engineering\nis there's no patch for it.\n\n457\n00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,240\nThere's no upgrade I can do.\n\n458\n00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,500\nThe best way to protect our networks\nagainst social engineering is education.\n\n459\n00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,940\nThe best way to protect yourself against\nsocial engineering is educating yourself,\n\n460\n00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,000\nunderstanding the different types\nof social engineering attacks,\n\n461\n00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,470\nbeing aware of that can help you\nprevent or to avoid those types of.\n\n462\n00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,600\n>> Absolutely, so you'll find\na lot of companies where they have\n\n463\n00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,730\nemployee education programs where they\nput you through some basic training or\n\n464\n00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:55,170\nepisodes like the one you're watching\nright now, that just enlighten you,\n\n465\n00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,805\nthey give you an idea of what\nyou need to look out for.\n\n466\n00:22:57,805 --> 00:23:00,240\n>> The Cornell website\nwas a great example.\n\n467\n00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,170\nHere's an organization that's every time\nthey have a social engineering at one\n\n468\n00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:08,540\nof those phishing scams come through their\nsystem, somebody turns it into the I.T.\n\n469\n00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,210\nand they've saved them and\nthey've made a website out of it.\n\n470\n00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:16,130\nAnd so now if you ever get a suspicious\nemail, you go look at that list and\n\n471\n00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:19,060\nyou see if yours,\nif there's an example of yours on there,\n\n472\n00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,670\njust kind of familiarize yourself with the\ndifferent avenues of social engineering.\n\n473\n00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:27,230\n>> So be aware that, if you're\nwatching this just for you personally,\n\n474\n00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:31,180\nyou've seen examples of what's out there,\nyou know what to look for, be aware and\n\n475\n00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:36,250\nalways be aware, trust but\nverify is what Reagan used to say.\n\n476\n00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,120\nSo keep that in mind if you're watching\nthis for your IT department or\n\n477\n00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,380\nyour organization, create a list, create\nexamples, send them to your end users and\n\n478\n00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,970\nlet them know, inform them,\n\n479\n00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,328\ntrain them and they'll be able\nto protect themselves better.\n\n480\n00:23:47,328 --> 00:23:49,250\n>> Exactly.\n\n481\n00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,110\n>> All right, well,\nMike I think that about wraps it up.\n\n482\n00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,870\nYou have anything else you want to add in?\n\n483\n00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,230\n>> I think so, just you know, be aware,\nbe vigilant is the one thing you can do.\n\n484\n00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,420\n>> All right, well ladies and gentleman,\n\n485\n00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,580\nwe hope you guys enjoy\nthe episode as much as we did.\n\n486\n00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,320\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n487\n00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,060\n>> I'm Mike

your host, Don Pezet, back with Mr.\nMike Rodrick, how's it going, Mike?\n\n4\n00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,850\n>> It is going great, Don.\n\n5\n00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,970\nWe've got another episode of our security\nfundamentals coming your way, and\n\n6\n00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,830\nin this one, We're gonna talk\nabout why encryption matters.\n\n7\n00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,130\nNow you guys out there have\nprobably heard the term encryption,\n\n8\n00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,000\nyou're familiar with the fact\nthat I got this information and\n\n9\n00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,480\neverybody says, oh,\nyou've gotta encrypt it to keep it safe.\n\n10\n00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,110\nWhat the heck are they talking about?\n\n11\n00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,700\nWhy do we wanna encrypt it?\n\n12\n00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,900\nAnd let's start Don, with just talking\nwhat the heck encryption is, right?\n\n13\n00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,610\nAnd encryption, means I'm going to\ntake what is known as plain text,\n\n14\n00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,360\nsomething that is human readable.\n\n15\n00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,030\nAnd turn it into ciphertext, something\nthat I'm not gonna be able to read without\n\n16\n00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:00,490\nknowing how to decrypt, or\nget that original information back out.\n\n17\n00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,450\nNow, I can show you a real simple\nexample of an encryption algorithm\n\n18\n00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,660\nhere on my computer.\n\n19\n00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,620\nWhat I've got up here is the Caesar\ncipher and this has been around,\n\n20\n00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,640\nwell since the days of Julius Caesar.\n\n21\n00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,630\nHe was one of the guys that was known for\n\n22\n00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,180\nusing this particular method, and\nit's a very simple shift algorithm.\n\n23\n00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:21,570\nAll we're doing is, as you can see on this\ntop row, I've got my English alphabet, and\n\n24\n00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,480\non the second row I've shifted everything\nover three spaces in this case, all right.\n\n25\n00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,290\nSo what I'm going to do,\n\n26\n00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,250\nwhen you go to encrypt something\nyou just take one letter at a time.\n\n27\n00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:36,440\nAnd if my plaintext, my human readable,\nis the word cryptography.\n\n28\n00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,836\nAnd if I want to use the Caesar\ncipher to encrypt that,\n\n29\n00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:40,711\nthen we're gonna go one letter at a time.\n\n30\n00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:44,310\nA C is actually gonna become an F.\n\n31\n00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,750\nAnd then the second letter is an R,\n\n32\n00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:51,270\nthat would become a U, on down the row\nuntil we run out of letters there.\n\n33\n00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,180\nSo down here,\n\n34\n00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,720\nthis is known as my ciphertext,\nthat's what you aren't able to read.\n\n35\n00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,270\nIf you don't know what algorithm I used,\nthen you're going to look at this and\n\n36\n00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,050\nnot be able to get that\noriginal information back out.\n\n37\n00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,940\nNow that's a very simple algorithm.\n\n38\n00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,430\nLike I said,\nit was back before the days of computers,\n\n39\n00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:13,070\nbut they used that as a way to show\nyou what encryption was all about.\n\n40\n00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,750\nThe stuff we use nowadays are very\ncomplex mathematical formulas\n\n41\n00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,640\ndeveloped by the brainiacs out\nthere at MIT and places like that.\n\n42\n00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,630\nBut in the end,\nthey're doing the same thing.\n\n43\n00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,280\nThey're taking something that's human\nreadable, and they're generating\n\n44\n00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,210\nciphertext, something that I cannot read\nwithout the proper decryption information.\n\n45\n00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,160\n>> And if you remember from\none of our earlier episodes,\n\n46\n00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,460\nwe talked about how in the IT security\nworld we're really trying to provide three\n\n47\n00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,180\nthings, confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n48\n00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,110\nThis one is a great example\nof confidentiality.\n\n49\n00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,810\nIf somebody intercepts that ciphertext\nthat Mike showed us a second ago,\n\n50\n00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,040\nthey don't know what that means, if they\ndon't have the key, they can't read it.\n\n51\n00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,860\nAnybody who needs to read it,\nI just give them the key.\n\n52\n00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,370\nI say, hey, just do the alphabet shift\nover four letters and you'll get it, and\n\n53\n00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,300\nnow they know, they can read it.\n\n54\n00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,560\nSo now when we send our data,\n\n55\n00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,640\nwe're ensuring that only\nthe people we want to get it can.\n\n56\n00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,520\nNow that ciphertext that\nMike did right there,\n\n57\n00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,100\nthat whole cipher in general\nwas a really easy one, right?\n\n58\n00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,995\nThat's why it's what, hundreds,\nthousands of years old.\n\n59\n00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The modern ones,\n\n60\n00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,480\nI mean the ciphertext is so crazy complex.\n\n61\n00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,670\nAnd it doesn't encrypt letter by letter,\n\n62\n00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,490\nit takes them in blocks now and really\ndoes some impressive stuff with them.\n\n63\n00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,590\nAnd it can make it where it would take\ncomputers millions of years of working\n\n64\n00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,560\nto try and break the encryption\nalgorithms that are in place today.\n\n65\n00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,120\nIt's really impressive\nhow that's advanced.\n\n66\n00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,920\n>> It really is.\n\n67\n00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,850\nAnd so,\nencryption is used all over the place.\n\n68\n00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,250\nSo now that we know what encryption is,\n\n69\n00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,260\nlet's talk about places where\nwe actually see it in use.\n\n70\n00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,240\nAnd you might not realize it,\nbut if you ever go online and\n\n71\n00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:51,420\ndo your online banking or anything\nlike that, you're using encryption.\n\n72\n00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,090\nYou're sending your information out there\nacross the World Wide Web to your bank,\n\n73\n00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:55,950\nfor example.\n\n74\n00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,285\nYou don't want the bad\nguys to intercept that, so\n\n75\n00:03:58,285 --> 00:03:59,865\nthey're going to make\nsure that's encrypted.\n\n76\n00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,985\nThis is a technology known as,\nwell it could be a couple of things.\n\n77\n00:04:02,985 --> 00:04:05,675\nSSL, or Secure Socket Layer,\n\n78\n00:04:05,675 --> 00:04:11,175\nis one method of securing communications\nbetween you and let's say a web server.\n\n79\n00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:14,955\nAnother one that we can use,\nthe newer version, kind of\n\n80\n00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:20,350\nthe evolved version of SSL, is TLS,\nor Transport Layer Security.\n\n81\n00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,650\nBoth of them are really\ntrying to do the same thing.\n\n82\n00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,430\nThere encrypting that data, right?\n\n83\n00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,190\nBecause I don't want somebody\nintercepting the information that I'm\n\n84\n00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,350\ntransmitting between my bank like\nmy username and my password.\n\n85\n00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,923\nWhen you go to log onto a website, right,\nyou go to your browser and you go to like\n\n86\n00:04:36,923 --> 00:04:40,440\nthat when you log into ITProTV, you'll\nsee that green bar up across the top, and\n\n87\n00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,120\nyou'll see that the URL starts\nwith the letters HTTPS, right?\n\n88\n00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,670\nThat's a Secure Socket Layer,\nan SSL connection, and it's showing you\n\n89\n00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:54,860\nthat any information that you send across\nthis connection is going to be encrypted.\n\n90\n00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,460\nSo if the bad guys out there\nintercept that information,\n\n91\n00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,880\nit's going to be unreadable.\n\n92\n00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,550\nThey're not going to be able to determine\nwhat information you're sending back\n\n93\n00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,610\nand forth.\n\n94\n00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,740\nSo we see it in web site\nsecurity very commonly.\n\n95\n00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,650\nAnother place I always see this is VPNs or\nvirtual Virtual Private Networks.\n\n96\n00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,630\nNowadays, it's very common to have\nworkers that are not located at the main\n\n97\n00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,510\noffice, right?\n\n98\n00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,730\nThey could be out at a branch office or\nthey could be traveling sales people,\n\n99\n00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:25,530\nthey could work in remote locations,\nthey could work from home.\n\n100\n00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,480\nBut they need access to the corporate\ndata to do their job, they need to be\n\n101\n00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,070\nable to connect to those files servers\nthat are back at the corporate office.\n\n102\n00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,570\nWell, I don't want that information\nbeing transmitted across the Internet\n\n103\n00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,580\nwhere just anybody can\ntry to intercept that.\n\n104\n00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,670\nSo VPNs are what we call\na Virtual Private Network, and\n\n105\n00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,190\nthey can be configured to do\nencryption to encrypt that traffic.\n\n106\n00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,750\nSo even though it's being sent across\nthe public infrastructure like\n\n107\n00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,010\nthe World Wide Web or the Internet,\nit's not accessible to them.\n\n108\n00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,690\nThey can capture the packets,\nsure, but they can't read it,\n\n109\n00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,330\nbecause they don't have the information\nneeded to decrypt that data.\n\n110\n00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:01,090\n>> You know, Mike, a lot of our\nviewers might not have ever used VPNs.\n\n111\n00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,210\nSSLs, I mean everybody uses that.\n\n112\n00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,630\nIf you've gone to a web page and\nyou see that lock appear, you've used it.\n\n113\n00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,340\nAutomatics in the background.\n\n114\n00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,680\nVPN is not so much.\n\n115\n00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,190\nSo I've actually made a few little\ndiagrams to show you guys to kind of\n\n116\n00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,530\nexplain the process of how VPN works.\n\n117\n00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,000\nOne of the big challenges we have is\nwhen we're browsing the Internet,\n\n118\n00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,290\nwe're accessing a resource\nover the Internet.\n\n119\n00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:24,150\nYou cross a lot of equipment you pass\nthrough a lot of servers between you and\n\n120\n00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,430\na destination.\n\n121\n00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,900\nSo, for example, if I,\nlet me just do a quick trace route here.\n\n122\n00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,400\nIf I browse to a website\nlike slashdot.org,\n\n123\n00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,480\nthat's a website that I like to go to.\n\n124\n00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,780\nAnd I'll trace that out, and\nit's gonna give me a list here\n\n125\n00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,940\nof all of the systems I pass through\nbetween here and that website.\n\n126\n00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,530\nSo when I browse out to\nthe slashdot website,\n\n127\n00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,470\nI'm actually passing through\n16 different systems.\n\n128\n00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,730\nNow, the very first one, that's our\nfirewall right here in the building,\n\n129\n00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,910\nthat's equipment we own, right?\n\n130\n00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,850\nThe very last one, that slashdot.org,\n\n131\n00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,970\nthat's the website that\nI'm trying to get to.\n\n132\n00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,430\nBut the 14 that are in between it,\nnumber 2 through number 15,\n\n133\n00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,940\nall those guys, I don't know who they are.\n\n134\n00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,290\nWell, I know who some of them are, right?\n\n135\n00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,420\nHere at the very beginning that's GRU.\n\n136\n00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,370\nGRU is the Gainesville Regional Utilities,\n\n137\n00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,760\nit's who we get our Internet through,\nright?\n\n138\n00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,530\nSo that's our Internet service provider.\n\n139\n00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,930\nWell right here, after step five,\nthey hand off to somebody else.\n\n140\n00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,300\nAnd then it jumps over to NTT, and\nthen NTT hands it off to Savvis.\n\n141\n00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,760\nAnd then Savvis hands it off to\nwhoever this is, just an IP.\n\n142\n00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,650\nAnd then that makes it over to slashdot.\n\n143\n00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,340\nI'm passing through a lot of equipment,\na lot of networks, and\n\n144\n00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,120\nI don't know a single\nemployee at those places.\n\n145\n00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,950\nI don't even know what companies\nthey are in a lot of cases,\n\n146\n00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,900\nI can't trust those networks.\n\n147\n00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,160\nSo if we're on our laptop and\nwe're at home, and\n\n148\n00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,290\nwe're browsing across\nthe Internet in our home office,\n\n149\n00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,770\nour headquarters that\nattach the Internet also.\n\n150\n00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:52,057\nI could browse and access that resource,\nwe're both attached to the Internet.\n\n151\n00:07:52,057 --> 00:07:56,529\nBut since we don't trust the network,\nif we're sending that data unsecure, or\n\n152\n00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:00,802\nanybody who's on the network is gonna\nbe able to see that, intercept it, and\n\n153\n00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:02,211\nhave access to the data.\n\n154\n00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:06,575\nSo what a VPN tunnel does is, it sets\nup encryption between, for example,\n\n155\n00:08:06,575 --> 00:08:10,249\nyour laptop and the firewall\nthat's at your headquarters, or\n\n156\n00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:12,830\nwherever your destination is, right?\n\n157\n00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,691\nIt doesn't have to be headquarters,\nit could be like my house.\n\n158\n00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:17,828\nI have a firewall of my house, so\nI can VPN in and access stuff at home.\n\n159\n00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:21,590\nSo you're gonna go across\nthe Internet to that, and\n\n160\n00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,690\nthat tunnel is just between you and\nthe firewall.\n\n161\n00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,550\nYou encrypt your data, you send your data\ninside of that tunnel to the firewall, and\n\n162\n00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,230\nthen the firewall decrypts it.\n\n163\n00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:35,980\nIt's the other end of that tunnel, it has\nthe key, so it decrypts that data, and\n\n164\n00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,660\nit throws it onto your\ncorporate network unencrypted.\n\n165\n00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,500\nSo now your servers and\nother resources at your headquarters,\n\n166\n00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,470\nthey function just like normal and don't\neven notice that the data was encrypted.\n\n167\n00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:50,460\nIt was just encrypted out here on\nthe not so safe network on the Internet.\n\n168\n00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,790\nVPN tunnels are a great way to implement\nencryption to protect your data but\n\n169\n00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,150\nthey are a little more manual,\nthese you're aware of, right.\n\n170\n00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,310\nYou gotta launch your VPN connection and\nso on.\n\n171\n00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,143\nIt's not transparent like SSL is.\n\n172\n00:09:01,143 --> 00:09:03,080\n>> Exactly but it's fantastic.\n\n173\n00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,445\nWithout encryption,\nmy company probably wouldn't let me\n\n174\n00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:10,515\naccess those file servers or those\nresources from home, because I would be\n\n175\n00:09:10,515 --> 00:09:13,555\ntransmitting that information\nacross that public infrastructure.\n\n176\n00:09:13,555 --> 00:09:18,155\nThey're not gonna pay the money to bury\na line between the corporate office and\n\n177\n00:09:18,155 --> 00:09:19,095\nmy house.\n\n178\n00:09:19,095 --> 00:09:21,975\nThat would be another way I could\nguarantee that nobody would be able to\n\n179\n00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:23,460\naccess that information.\n\n180\n00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,324\nThese VPN, these virtual private networks,\nthese tunneling protocols,\n\n181\n00:09:28,324 --> 00:09:33,265\nallow me to take advantage of this\nexisting free to use public infrastructure\n\n182\n00:09:33,265 --> 00:09:35,787\nand still keep my information secure.\n\n183\n00:09:35,787 --> 00:09:39,383\nJust like SSL, without SSL,\nif I didn't have the ability to encrypt\n\n184\n00:09:39,383 --> 00:09:43,475\nthe information that I'm transmitting\nbetween me and say, Bank of America,\n\n185\n00:09:43,475 --> 00:09:46,091\nthen I'm not gonna do my banking online,\nright?\n\n186\n00:09:46,091 --> 00:09:50,557\nI'd have to go down to the facility and\ndo my banking there because of encryption,\n\n187\n00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:53,810\nbecause of SSL, because of TLS,\nI can keep that data safe.\n\n188\n00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,760\nI can take advantage of that public\ninfrastructure and I don't have to worry\n\n189\n00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,900\nabout the bad guys trying to intercept and\nread my private information.\n\n190\n00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,450\nSo a couple of really good uses for\nencryption.\n\n191\n00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,270\nProtecting that traffic\nas it travels back and\n\n192\n00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,180\nforth when web servers with\nthings like SSL or TLS.\n\n193\n00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,510\nAnd creating VPN connections between the\ncorporate office and a branch office, or\n\n194\n00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,040\nbetween a home and a work.\n\n195\n00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,630\nOr, for Don, from here back to his house,\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n196\n00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,380\nSo really good uses for\nencryption and that's not all, right?\n\n197\n00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,870\nThat's not the only place we\nsee encryption being used.\n\n198\n00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,640\n>> Yeah, another place is email.\n\n199\n00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,120\nWhen you write an email,\na lot of people don't realize this,\n\n200\n00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,820\nbut almost all email, all email for\n\n201\n00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,800\nthe entire world transfers from server\nto server using a protocol called SMTP.\n\n202\n00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,220\nThe simple mail transport protocol.\n\n203\n00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,100\nAnd SMTP was developed at a time\nwhen networks were safer, right?\n\n204\n00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,854\nWhere networks were smaller.\n\n205\n00:10:43,854 --> 00:10:45,241\n>> The world was a happier, safer place.\n\n206\n00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:46,600\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n207\n00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,960\nWell, it's not like that anymore,\nnow it's the Wild West out there.\n\n208\n00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:55,930\nAnd so we can't trust protocols like SMTP,\ncuz they send the email in plain text.\n\n209\n00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,730\nAnybody on the network could\nintercept that traffic and\n\n210\n00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,690\nnow they can read your email.\n\n211\n00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,500\nThat would be bad, right?\n\n212\n00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,660\nYour email's probably safe on the server.\n\n213\n00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,880\nIt's probably safe on your desktop.\n\n214\n00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,120\nBut in transit, it's at risk.\n\n215\n00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,130\nSo we might want to encrypt our email.\n\n216\n00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:12,030\nAnd there's solutions\nout there like OpenGPG,\n\n217\n00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,210\nwhere you can encrypt your\nemail before you send it.\n\n218\n00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:18,370\nAnd that way if somebody intercepts it,\nwell they can't read it, it's encrypted.\n\n219\n00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,680\nAnd there's third party services like,\nI've got the web page for\n\n220\n00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,930\nMailvelope pulled up.\n\n221\n00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,660\nMailvelope is a service, I like it.\n\n222\n00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,590\nIt's a little plugin you can\ninstall it in your web browser,\n\n223\n00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,260\nlike inside of Chrome or Firefox.\n\n224\n00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,950\nAnd when you're writing\nan email in Gmail or Yahoo, or\n\n225\n00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,950\nany of the various ones, Outlook.com,\nwhen you're writing that email,\n\n226\n00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,620\nyou can hit this little plugin, it'll\ntake your text, and it'll encrypt it.\n\n227\n00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,930\nAnd then when you send it,\nyour text is encrypted.\n\n228\n00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,320\nAnd at the other end, if the person has\nyour key, or you'd encrypt it with their\n\n229\n00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,320\nkey, really, they would then decrypt\nthat data, and they could view it.\n\n230\n00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,180\nNow the email's safe on your desktop,\nin transit, sitting there on a server,\n\n231\n00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,790\nand it's not decrypted until that\nperson opens it up and accesses it.\n\n232\n00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,580\nServices like these OpenPGP,\nOpenGPG, Encryption, and\n\n233\n00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,650\nMailvelope, these services,\nthey are really easy to use.\n\n234\n00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,110\nThey're just not there by default.\n\n235\n00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,510\nSo if you don't look for\nit, you don't have it.\n\n236\n00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,480\nIt's not like on a website where\nit automatically kicks in.\n\n237\n00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,560\nHere you have to actively\nset out to do it.\n\n238\n00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,680\n>> But very important,\n\n239\n00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,690\ncuz we know sometimes we put information\nin an email that's sensitive, right?\n\n240\n00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:27,550\nIf we're sending things back and forth to\nco-workers, sometimes people don't realize\n\n241\n00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,550\nthat if you're not running\nthat mail server in house,\n\n242\n00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,270\nmaybe if your company uses a third party,\n\n243\n00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:36,400\nyour mail might be bouncing out from\nthe corporate network and then back in.\n\n244\n00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,190\nOr if you're sending email to a business\npartner or something like that,\n\n245\n00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,590\ncould be sensitive information in there.\n\n246\n00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:46,620\nAnd it's not protected unless you take\nthat extra step to encrypt it using\n\n247\n00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,900\none of those protocols, or maybe if you're\nrunning Outlook you can do the S/MIME,\n\n248\n00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:56,775\nor something like that to protect it\nas it's traveling across the network.\n\n249\n00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:59,820\n>> Now, we're talking about data\ntraveling across the network.\n\n250\n00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,060\nIn the security world,\nthey call this data in motion, right?\n\n251\n00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,815\nData is moving from one place to another.\n\n252\n00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:07,395\nAnd that's usually the hardest to secure.\n\n253\n00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:09,925\nBut data at its source, or\n\n254\n00:13:09,925 --> 00:13:15,035\ndata once it reaches the destination,\nis well, it's data at rest.\n\n255\n00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:17,185\nData in motion, data at rest.\n\n256\n00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:20,045\nData at rest has reached wherever\nit's gonna reach, it's sitting there,\n\n257\n00:13:20,045 --> 00:13:23,685\nit's sitting on a hard drive or\nwhatever, that data's at risk too.\n\n258\n00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:28,950\nAnd if I've got a file sitting here on my\nhard drive and I leave my laptop in a cab,\n\n259\n00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,795\nthe next person the cab could grab\nmy laptop and now they got my data.\n\n260\n00:13:31,795 --> 00:13:33,760\nThat's data at rest,\nthey didn't intercept it on the network.\n\n261\n00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,545\nYou don't have to be a crazy hacker,\nif it's, if you just steal a laptop,\n\n262\n00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:37,770\nyou got it, right?\n\n263\n00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,120\nSo we need ways to secure that data and\n\n264\n00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,350\nyou can do encryption right there within\nyour own machine also, it's very common.\n\n265\n00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,400\n>> Yeah, a lot of our operating\nsystems have ways built into them,\n\n266\n00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,840\nwe can go out and get third party\nsoftware to do this as well.\n\n267\n00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,360\nIn Windows, for example,\n\n268\n00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,810\nusing the file system they've got\ntheir encrypting file system or EFS,\n\n269\n00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,580\nand it allows me, as Don said,\nto protect that data while it's at rest.\n\n270\n00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,320\nThis is another layer of security.\n\n271\n00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,180\nNow there's other things\nthat are in place.\n\n272\n00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,950\nI can control access to files\nusing permissions, right?\n\n273\n00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,750\nI can give you read or write or\nI can deny you permissions.\n\n274\n00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,920\nBut when we talk about security we always\ntalk about layers of security, and\n\n275\n00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,950\nthis is just another layer on top of that.\n\n276\n00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,670\nAdding that layer of encryption\nkeeps that data safe.\n\n277\n00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:29,290\nWe've got things like BitLocker in Windows\nthat can encrypt the entire hard drive.\n\n278\n00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,658\nIf you encrypt individual files,\nthat's good,\n\n279\n00:14:32,658 --> 00:14:34,630\nbut you can also encrypt that entire hard,\nso\n\n280\n00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:40,040\nif somebody steals that drive, everything\non that drive is gonna be encrypted.\n\n281\n00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,820\nAnd there's other programs you\ncan use like TrueCrypt was one,\n\n282\n00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,670\nPGP has a file encryption method as well.\n\n283\n00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,780\n>> Yeah, you get solutions like what used\nto be TrueCrypt is now VeraCrypt, right?\n\n284\n00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,870\nAnd you can encrypt your whole\nhard drive and it's super easy.\n\n285\n00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,660\nLike on my Mac,\nI use it to encrypt everything,\n\n286\n00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,390\nmy whole hard drive cuz, again, if I lose\nmy device I don't wanna have to go and\n\n287\n00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,900\nscramble to find that stuff.\n\n288\n00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,130\nSo those kind of things,\nwe just have to know to turn them on, and\n\n289\n00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,960\nit is important and\nthen your data is safe.\n\n290\n00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,740\nAnd that's extending beyond PCs too,\n\n291\n00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,480\nyou're starting to see cell phones\nthat have whole device encryption.\n\n292\n00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,030\nI know Android and iOS both support that\nBlackBerry support it so that it really\n\n293\n00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,155\ndoesn't matter if you're one of the five\nBlackBerry users you can do it too.\n\n294\n00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:24,814\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n295\n00:15:24,814 --> 00:15:27,057\neverybody out there got\nthat ability to use it and\n\n296\n00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:30,668\nthat's just something that either,\nusually the vendors have to turn it on for\n\n297\n00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:33,811\nyou before people use it because\nmost people don't think about it.\n\n298\n00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:36,563\nMost people don't know to go and\nenable that.\n\n299\n00:15:36,563 --> 00:15:37,608\n>> Exactly.\n\n300\n00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:40,260\nSo Don,\nI think you've got a little demo for us.\n\n301\n00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,858\nWe're gonna step back and maybe do a look\nat sending data across the network and\n\n302\n00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:46,539\nwhat it looks like, right?\n\n303\n00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:50,083\nWe've been talking about how when\nyou send it, it's plain text and\n\n304\n00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:54,390\nit's human readable unless you take the\nextra step to encrypt that information.\n\n305\n00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,694\nOnce you do that,\nthey can intercept it still.\n\n306\n00:15:56,694 --> 00:15:59,104\nIt doesn't prevent them from\ngaining access to the data.\n\n307\n00:15:59,104 --> 00:16:01,363\nBut once they get it,\nit's gonna be encrypted,\n\n308\n00:16:01,363 --> 00:16:03,137\nthey're not gonna be able to read it.\n\n309\n00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:06,120\n>> Yeah,\nwe talk about somebody could intercept it.\n\n310\n00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,730\nWell, what do we mean by that,\nhow do they intercept it?\n\n311\n00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,855\nSo I wanna show you guys an example\nof using a non-secure protocol, and\n\n312\n00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:17,095\nwhat that looks like on the network versus\nusing a secure protocol, all right?\n\n313\n00:16:17,095 --> 00:16:19,715\nSo what I'm gonna do here is,\nI'm on a Windows 8 machine, but\n\n314\n00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:22,115\nI'm gonna remote into a Linux server.\n\n315\n00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:25,615\nI need to remote into this Linux\nserver and access a file, all right?\n\n316\n00:16:25,615 --> 00:16:29,485\nSo I'm gonna do that using\na protocol that's not secure,\n\n317\n00:16:29,485 --> 00:16:31,600\nI gonna use an old protocol called Telnet.\n\n318\n00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,050\nAnd Telnet was one of those protocols,\nlike SMTP, that was written back in\n\n319\n00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:39,770\nthe day when networks were safer,\nand so it doesn't do encryption.\n\n320\n00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,600\nNow at the same time I'm gonna\nfire up this handy little program,\n\n321\n00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,510\nthis program is called Wireshark.\n\n322\n00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:49,760\nAnd what Wireshark does is it lets\nme record traffic on the network, so\n\n323\n00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,400\nit watches the traffic for information and\nit records it right here into this system.\n\n324\n00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,960\nSo I'm gonna start recording and, well,\n\n325\n00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,330\nas soon as I authorize it to record,\nI'll just punch that in, there we go.\n\n326\n00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,150\nAnd now Wireshark is up and\n\n327\n00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,950\nrunning, and recording network\ncommunications, all right?\n\n328\n00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,550\nNow what I'm gonna do next is,\n\n329\n00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,660\nI'm gonna fire up a non-secure\nconnection to this Linux box.\n\n330\n00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,370\nAnd I'm going to log in as dpezet and\nI'm gonna punch in my password.\n\n331\n00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,420\nNow, I'm gonna tell you guys my password.\n\n332\n00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,910\nMy password is password one, two, three.\n\n333\n00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,670\nAll right, but\n\n334\n00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,170\nif you were watching over my shoulder\nyou wouldn't have seen that, right?\n\n335\n00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,860\nI typed my password and you didn't\nsee anything appear there, right?\n\n336\n00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,330\nJust nothing, nothing there but I assure\nyou, I typed password one, two, three.\n\n337\n00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:37,150\nI'm in the server now and\nI can pull up a directory listing, and\n\n338\n00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:42,540\nmaybe I get into my documents folder and\nI pull up a listing there.\n\n339\n00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,045\nAnd then I wanna read that\npayroll.text file, and\n\n340\n00:17:46,045 --> 00:17:50,505\nso I'm going to do a more payroll.txt.\n\n341\n00:17:50,505 --> 00:17:56,735\nOops, it's a little case sensitive, so\nI'll punch that in and there we go.\n\n342\n00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:01,285\nI can see this file, it's confidential, I\ncan see that John Smith makes $14 an hour.\n\n343\n00:18:01,285 --> 00:18:03,655\nI can see that Sarah Thompson\nmakes $18 an hour.\n\n344\n00:18:03,655 --> 00:18:06,270\nAnd good old Steve Buscemi,\nhe only makes $9 an hour.\n\n345\n00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,980\nSo I can see this is kinda\npayroll right there.\n\n346\n00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,190\nI'm getting the information and\nthen I get out.\n\n347\n00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,510\nOkay?\n>> But it's safe, right?\n\n348\n00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,240\nIt was secured on the server up there.\n\n349\n00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,840\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n350\n00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,700\n>> It's secured on your machine so\nwho could have seen that data?\n\n351\n00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,260\n>> All right.\nIf an attacker could have gotten\n\n352\n00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,420\nin between me and the server, if they\ncould have positioned themselves in\n\n353\n00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,000\nthe network somewhere\nto be in between me and\n\n354\n00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,180\nthe server They could have intercepted\nthe traffic using a tool like Wireshark.\n\n355\n00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,210\nAnd what Wireshark does is it\ncaptures that data and it records it.\n\n356\n00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,520\nAnd I can see the raw packets down here if\nI start looking at like some of the Telnet\n\n357\n00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,800\ntraffic that it caught.\n\n358\n00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,920\nI can see the raw packets,\n\n359\n00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,881\nnow if you look at the raw data What\ndoes that mean to you right there Mike?\n\n360\n00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:46,681\n>> That doesn't mean too\nmuch to me at this point.\n\n361\n00:18:46,681 --> 00:18:48,500\n>> It just looks like gibberish right?\n\n362\n00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,490\n>> Well, we don't understand it, but\nthe computer does and what's happening\n\n363\n00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:57,020\nis the data has been broken up and\nspread across multiple packets and\n\n364\n00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,030\nI can just tell Wireshark to\nput that back together for me.\n\n365\n00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,190\nAnd so I'm gonna go in here and\ntell it to follow the TCP stream, and\n\n366\n00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,800\nit's gonna reassemble.\n\n367\n00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,500\nAnd now all of a sudden things start\nto look a lot more clear don't they?\n\n368\n00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,560\nAnd I can see here is a logon\nscreen that I got, Linux Mint 17.1,\n\n369\n00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,140\nit asked for a username.\n\n370\n00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,060\nAnything in red is\ninformation that I typed,\n\n371\n00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,920\nanything in blue is information\nthe server displayed.\n\n372\n00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,580\nSo see how my name dpezet, how it's all\ndoubled up there because I would type\n\n373\n00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,410\na letter and it would echo the letter\non my screen that's why I see it twice.\n\n374\n00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:32,360\nBut when I type my password that\ndidn't show up on the screen did it?\n\n375\n00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,535\nBut I typed it and there it is in\nplain text password123 somebody\n\n376\n00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:39,835\nwatching the network now has\nmy username and my password.\n\n377\n00:19:41,085 --> 00:19:45,425\nWorse than that though, they then\nwent on to monitor everything else.\n\n378\n00:19:45,425 --> 00:19:48,365\nThey can see where I pull up a directory\nlisting, they can see the directories and\n\n379\n00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:49,815\nfiles that I had.\n\n380\n00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:53,135\nAnd then after that they can see where\nI went into the documents folder.\n\n381\n00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:57,335\nI have my typo where I spelled payroll\nwrong, and then I've got my more payroll.\n\n382\n00:19:57,335 --> 00:20:00,970\nAnd then right after that, they've got\nthe output of that file right there,\n\n383\n00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,850\nthe payroll information\nall sent in plain text.\n\n384\n00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,900\n>> That's not good.\n\n385\n00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,980\n>> That's the danger of using\nan unencrypted protocol.\n\n386\n00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:14,140\nLet's do the same thing, but\nthis time I'm going to switch and\n\n387\n00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,430\nI'm gonna use a different protocol.\n\n388\n00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,730\nLet me start this recorder again.\n\n389\n00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,680\nOkay, so I'm gonna start that\nrecording network traffic again.\n\n390\n00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:28,790\nAnd then I'm gonna jump back over here and\nthis time I'm gonna use SSH.\n\n391\n00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:34,840\nSSH is the secure shell,\nit does the same thing that Telnet does.\n\n392\n00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:40,070\nThe difference is when you connect\nwith SSH it uses encryption.\n\n393\n00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:44,510\nSo I just connected and I got into my\nshell and I can pull up a directory, and\n\n394\n00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,770\nI can go into the documents folder,\nand I can do more.\n\n395\n00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,860\nHere I'll even do the typos again, more\npayroll.txt and it finds that it's wrong\n\n396\n00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,310\nand then I can capitalize that p,\nwhich is my problem there.\n\n397\n00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,080\nAnd now I can see the file and\nthen I can get out, all right?\n\n398\n00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,320\nI just did everything\nthat I did with Telnet.\n\n399\n00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,530\n>> Didn't look any different to me.\n\n400\n00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,090\n>> Nope, the only difference is\nI used SSH instead of Telnet,\n\n401\n00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,650\nand SSH uses encryption.\n\n402\n00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,220\nAnd back here in Wireshark,\n\n403\n00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,130\nI see that traffic,\nI see that SSH traffic right there, right?\n\n404\n00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,730\nAnd if I click on it, I see junk down here\njust like before, but if I reassemble\n\n405\n00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,890\nthis stream, I'll tell Wireshark\nto put it all back together again.\n\n406\n00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,130\nWhen I tell it to follow that stream.\n\n407\n00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,890\nWell, right here at\nthe beginning I see some words.\n\n408\n00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,330\nDiffie–Hellman, right, those are words.\n\n409\n00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,160\nI see open SSH.\n\n410\n00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,800\nSo it looks like there's some\nplain text action going on.\n\n411\n00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,740\nBut right after this block, what do I see?\n\n412\n00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,780\nGibberish and garbage.\n\n413\n00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,040\nWell, I thought this thing\njust reassembled it for me.\n\n414\n00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,750\nWell, it did, but\nit reassembled all the encrypted junk.\n\n415\n00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,750\nAll right, it's encrypted.\n\n416\n00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,930\nThis is ciphertext.\n\n417\n00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,930\nThere's nothing I can do about it, right.\n\n418\n00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,400\nHere's all this information,\nit's spread out here, it's junk.\n\n419\n00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:01,290\nAs an attacker,\nthis is meaningless to me, all right.\n\n420\n00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:05,370\nThis giant block up here at the beginning,\nthis is my client,\n\n421\n00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,240\nremember anything in red\nis what I'm sending.\n\n422\n00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,710\nSo this is my client,\n\n423\n00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:13,690\nright here, telling the server what\ntypes of encryption I support.\n\n424\n00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,200\nAnd I'm saying to the server,\nhey, I support all this stuff.\n\n425\n00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,430\nDo you support any of these?\n\n426\n00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,190\nIf so, well, let's use encryption.\n\n427\n00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,725\nAnd then the server responds saying,\n\n428\n00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:25,500\n[LAUGH] yeah, I support those,\nand about twice as many more.\n\n429\n00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,710\nThen the server, [LAUGH] I'm actually\nremoted into one of Daniel's servers and\n\n430\n00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,450\nit's just through the roof with\nall the stuff that it supports.\n\n431\n00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,410\nSo there's a ton of different\nencryption standards there.\n\n432\n00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,330\nAnd between the two they'll\npick the strongest.\n\n433\n00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,830\nAnd then off they go.\n\n434\n00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,890\nEverything after that is encrypted, right.\n\n435\n00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:43,310\nThey agreed on what standard to use,\nand now it's encrypted.\n\n436\n00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:48,210\nNow my data is safe from an attacker\nsitting in-between me and the server.\n\n437\n00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:48,870\n>> Nice, I like that.\n\n438\n00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:52,880\nSo they're negotiating what encryption\nalgorithm they're gonna be using,\n\n439\n00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,890\nwhat method they're gonna use,\nwhat language or\n\n440\n00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:58,580\nset of rules they're gonna\nuse to secure that traffic.\n\n441\n00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,290\nBoth ends do have to support whatever\nit is that we're using, right?\n\n442\n00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,600\nIt'd be like two people speaking\ndifferent languages, difficult for\n\n443\n00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,880\nthem to communicate.\n\n444\n00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,150\nSo that's why they do\nthe negotiation Process.\n\n445\n00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,690\nHey, I support this, do you?\n\n446\n00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,500\nNo, I support this, do you?\n\n447\n00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,070\nNo, do you support this?\n\n448\n00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,280\nYes.\nOh, let's use that one.\n\n449\n00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,130\nAnd they're gonna negotiate the strongest\none that they both understand.\n\n450\n00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,480\nSo let's start at the top basically, and\n\n451\n00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,180\nwork their way down till they\nfind one that they both agree on.\n\n452\n00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,680\nAnd then they can encrypt\nthat traffic back and forth.\n\n453\n00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,290\nAnd even if you're running\nsomething like Wireshark,\n\n454\n00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,730\nsomebody's intercepting that traffic,\nThey're not gonna be able to read it.\n\n455\n00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,780\nVery good stuff.\n\n456\n00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,910\n>> Yup, now for us as an end user, when\nit's automatic encryption like with SSL,\n\n457\n00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:40,570\nor even SSH here,\nI didn't tell it what protocol to use.\n\n458\n00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,793\nThe nice part about these is\nthey negotiate it for us.\n\n459\n00:23:43,793 --> 00:23:48,502\nBut just to give you guys a little more\ninformation, all of these different\n\n460\n00:23:48,502 --> 00:23:53,212\nencryption algorithms that are in\nthe list, and we'll just use Daniel's\n\n461\n00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:57,844\nserver here as the example, I mean that\nis a big big list of stuff here Curve\n\n462\n00:23:57,844 --> 00:24:03,920\n25519-sha256 all the way up to none,\nI guess is kinda down here at the end.\n\n463\n00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,230\nAll these different ones.\n\n464\n00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,210\nThese are all different strengths too.\n\n465\n00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,440\nSome of these are weak,\nsome of these are strong, right?\n\n466\n00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,350\nIf we start looking at some of\nthem that are like AES-256, that's\n\n467\n00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:19,460\na pretty strong encryption algorithm and\nwe'd love the use one like that.\n\n468\n00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,092\nBut then when you start getting all\nthe way down here to like none.\n\n469\n00:24:22,092 --> 00:24:25,170\nWell, [LAUGH] obviously none,\nthat's not good, we don't want that.\n\n470\n00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:28,050\nSo we're not typically gonna\nuse that if we can avoid it.\n\n471\n00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:32,090\nSo hopefully they negotiate\na strong line and off they go.\n\n472\n00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,230\nYou don't always have equal\nsupport though, right.\n\n473\n00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:37,770\nNotice how my client,\nI'm using a software client called PuTTY.\n\n474\n00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:42,020\nAnd PuTTY, it only has support for,\nI mean what is that, maybe 20 or\n\n475\n00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,460\n25 different ones.\n\n476\n00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,920\nBut Daniel's server must be updated or\nnewer or just more secure than mine.\n\n477\n00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,230\nIt looks like he's worth\nabout fifty different types.\n\n478\n00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,470\nThere's a lot that are out there and for\n\n479\n00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,930\nthe most part he's,\nDaniel's over there celebrating.\n\n480\n00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:55,933\nHe's got me beat.\n\n481\n00:24:55,933 --> 00:24:56,740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For\n\n482\n00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,710\nthe most part, we just want to\nchoose the strongest one we can.\n\n483\n00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:04,090\nNew encryption algorithms\ndo come out fairly often.\n\n484\n00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,700\nIt's one of those things where\n\n485\n00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,250\nan encryption algorithm created\none day might be great that day.\n\n486\n00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,880\nBut 20 years from now,\ncomputers will advance so much that\n\n487\n00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,180\nthat encryption is no longer valuable, and\nwe see that with things like DES, right?\n\n488\n00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,400\nWhich I'm sure is in\nthe list here somewhere.\n\n489\n00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,990\nDES, which is an old encryption\nstandard developed in the 70s by IBM,\n\n490\n00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,710\nit was very very popular for\na long time, and back in the 70s and\n\n491\n00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:31,020\n80s it was more than enough,\nvery secure, right?\n\n492\n00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,300\nBut today you can break those pretty easy.\n\n493\n00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,450\nA modern computer,\nlike with an Intel Xeon processor or\n\n494\n00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,410\nwhatever can knock that out in seconds,\nright?\n\n495\n00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,540\nSo that technology didn't hold up to\nthe test of time and none of them do.\n\n496\n00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,340\nNone of the encryption algorithms\nwill be in use 50 years from now,\n\n497\n00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,620\ncuz computers will be so\nmuch further ahead.\n\n498\n00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:53,070\nSo that's why they have to keep creating\nnew ones, stronger ones, right?\n\n499\n00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:57,678\nIt used to be that a 1,024-bit\nkey was considered really secure.\n\n500\n00:25:57,678 --> 00:26:01,450\nNow a 4,096-bit key is\nconsidered secure and\n\n501\n00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:04,930\nit just gets bigger and bigger and bigger\nas processors and computers advance.\n\n502\n00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,350\nSo, definitely something to keep in mind.\n\n503\n00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:10,530\nThis is a moving target, right,\nit's changing technology.\n\n504\n00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,190\n>> And that's why they do\nthat negotiation rather than\n\n505\n00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,470\npick one that we're always gonna use.\n\n506\n00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,310\nBy using that negotiation process,\nwe can add more on the server and\n\n507\n00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,670\nwe can add more on the application end.\n\n508\n00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,940\nAnd they'll always use the strongest\none that they both support.\n\n509\n00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,750\nSo it gives us that flexibility to\nstay up with the latest algorithms.\n\n510\n00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,580\nThe algorithm again, that's that\nmathematical formula that's actually doing\n\n511\n00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:37,080\nthe computation, taking that plain\ntext and outputting that ciphertext.\n\n512\n00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,150\nThat's that mathematical formula there,\nand as you said,\n\n513\n00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:44,440\nthere's a lot of them available,\nsome of them stronger than others.\n\n514\n00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,300\n>> Yeah, and we are seeing a battle with\nthis right now, which is Google Chrome.\n\n515\n00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,660\nGoogle Chrome.\n\n516\n00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,750\nThe guys at Google have started really\ntaking a hard stance on encryption and\n\n517\n00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:00,190\nsaying, if you go to a website and\nyou negotiate SSL with that website and\n\n518\n00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:05,510\nthey choose a protocol that's too low,\nthen we won't use it.\n\n519\n00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,360\nThey just won't let you use SSL,\nand they'll warn you and\n\n520\n00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,800\nsay the site's not secure.\n\n521\n00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,820\nSo some websites might be using some of\nthose weaker encryption standards and\n\n522\n00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,425\nIt's kind of up to you,\nyour software developers,\n\n523\n00:27:16,425 --> 00:27:18,390\nyour server support technicians.\n\n524\n00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,160\nThey all kind of have to agree to say I'm\ngoing to stop supporting those low level\n\n525\n00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,330\nencryption, right?\n\n526\n00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,940\nThat was a part of some of the bigger\nexploits that have come out last year.\n\n527\n00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,360\nSo it does change,\nyou have to stay on top of it.\n\n528\n00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,300\n>> It does and you might wonder,\n\n529\n00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,090\nwell why don't they just take\nsome of those weaker ones out?\n\n530\n00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,290\nWhy even leave them in the list and\nallow them to be negotiated for?\n\n531\n00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,850\nAnd that's because while the longer key,\n\n532\n00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:41,420\nthe stronger the algorithm is true, that\nalso means the more processing power that\n\n533\n00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:45,470\nit takes to perform those mathematical\nalgorithms to take that plain text,\n\n534\n00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,500\nturn into ciphertext, and\nconvert it back into plain text.\n\n535\n00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,745\nSo you might have an older system\nthat just doesn't have the horsepower\n\n536\n00:27:51,745 --> 00:27:56,145\nto actually perform the calculations\nif we use a 4,096-bit key.\n\n537\n00:27:56,145 --> 00:28:00,185\nI'd love to use that on everything, but\nthat's going to slow some things down.\n\n538\n00:28:00,185 --> 00:28:04,345\nMy little wireless access point couldn't\nhandle it, it would choke the system.\n\n539\n00:28:04,345 --> 00:28:07,450\nSo in that case I've got to\nchoose one that's strong, but\n\n540\n00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,657\nnot quite as strong as that 4,096-bit key.\n\n541\n00:28:10,657 --> 00:28:12,960\n>> Yeah.\nAnd you know who's to blame, Mike?\n\n542\n00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,055\nThe United States.\n\n543\n00:28:14,055 --> 00:28:17,460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A lot of it is our fault,\n\n544\n00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,040\nwhere the United States government\nhad rules for a long time that said\n\n545\n00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,170\nif you wrote software that used encryption\nor made hardware that used encryption,\n\n546\n00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:30,013\nyou couldn't sell it to other countries\nunless you limited it to, is it 40 bits?\n\n547\n00:28:30,013 --> 00:28:30,840\nI think it was 40 or 48.\n\n548\n00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,010\nIt was 40 bits.\n\n549\n00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,580\nSo for years,\neven though we had stronger encryption,\n\n550\n00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,780\nwe'd only export this 40 bits stuff, and\nso that kind of became the standard.\n\n551\n00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,200\nIf you wanted your equipment\nto work all over the world,\n\n552\n00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,040\nyou cap it at 40 bit, which was weak.\n\n553\n00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,790\nAnd at the time, they said they did that\nbecause they didn't want foreign powers or\n\n554\n00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,440\nwhatever to have better\nencryption than us.\n\n555\n00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,200\nAnd now we know it's that, well,\nthey wanted to be able to view everything.\n\n556\n00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So apparently that worked.\n\n557\n00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:00,920\nSo we are seeing a lot of\npeople correct for that and\n\n558\n00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,410\nget better about it and encryption\nstandards are being developed independent\n\n559\n00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,500\nof the United States now\nwhich is a good thing.\n\n560\n00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,930\nReally independent of any government\nwould be a great idea, so.\n\n561\n00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:13,330\nAll right, but hopefully,\nthrough our examples and our stories here,\n\n562\n00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:17,780\nyou guys have had a chance to\nlearn why encryption is important.\n\n563\n00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,970\nIt's not just a cool thing, it's not just\nneat to see that little lock up there.\n\n564\n00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,150\nIt actually serves a purpose.\n\n565\n00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:27,320\nIt's really incredibly beneficial,\nespecially when using networks like\n\n566\n00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,480\nthe Internet or the free wireless at\nStarbucks or whatever it is that you're\n\n567\n00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,492\nusing, if you're on a network you don't\ntrust, you need to encrypt your data.\n\n568\n00:29:35,492 --> 00:29:37,620\n>> This is that confidentiality,\n\n569\n00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,300\na big part of what we're trying\nto do when we implement security.\n\n570\n00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:44,220\n>> All right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, this is a good spot for\n\n571\n00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,880\nus to wrap up this episode.\n\n572\n00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,420\nWe hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n573\n00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:47,940\nStay tuned,\n\n574\n00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,720\nwe've got more security fundamentals\nepisodes coming up down the road.\n\n575\n00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,120\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n576\n00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120\n>> And I'm Mike

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14,276 --> 00:00:15,962\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:15,962 --> 00:00:17,380\nBack again with Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,138\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n7\n00:00:18,138 --> 00:00:19,940\n>> It's going fantastic,\nDon, really excited.\n\n8\n00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,172\nWe've got another episode of our\nsecurity fundamentals coming your way.\n\n9\n00:00:23,172 --> 00:00:27,300\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\ntalking about full drive encryption.\n\n10\n00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,157\nWhere instead of encrypting\nan individual file or folder,\n\n11\n00:00:30,157 --> 00:00:33,100\nwe're going to encrypt\nthe entire hard drive.\n\n12\n00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:39,110\n>> Now, Mike, help me out here, why would\nI want to encrypt my entire hard drive?\n\n13\n00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,586\nMy computer,\nI've got a password on it, right.\n\n14\n00:00:41,586 --> 00:00:42,362\nIt's secure.\n\n15\n00:00:42,362 --> 00:00:45,113\nWhen I walk away from my desk,\nI make sure I lock the screen,\n\n16\n00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:46,832\nso nobody's going to get at my data.\n\n17\n00:00:46,832 --> 00:00:49,925\nIsn't encrypting the whole\ndisk a little like overkill?\n\n18\n00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,134\n>> You might think that, and\nthose are some good practices, right?\n\n19\n00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:55,705\nWalk away from you computer,\nlock that screen, you're using a good,\n\n20\n00:00:55,705 --> 00:00:56,666\nstrong password.\n\n21\n00:00:56,666 --> 00:01:00,143\nThe problem is, what if somebody\nsteals the computer, right?\n\n22\n00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,487\nOn our mobile devices,\non these laptops, easy to leave those\n\n23\n00:01:03,487 --> 00:01:08,330\nthings laying around somewhere, easy for\nsomebody just to walk by and pick it up.\n\n24\n00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,301\nAnd sure, they can't get into your\ncomputer because you get that\n\n25\n00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:12,390\ngood strong password.\n\n26\n00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,632\nI've got it nice and long, and\nthey aren't going to be able to get that.\n\n27\n00:01:15,632 --> 00:01:18,256\nWhat if they just take the hard\ndrive out of your computer, right?\n\n28\n00:01:18,256 --> 00:01:19,216\nThis is not difficult.\n\n29\n00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:20,634\nWe can pop that laptop open.\n\n30\n00:01:20,634 --> 00:01:22,321\nI can take that hard drive out.\n\n31\n00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:24,314\nI can throw it in my own computer.\n\n32\n00:01:24,314 --> 00:01:26,181\nI know the password to my computer.\n\n33\n00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:28,357\nNow, I've got access to all of your data.\n\n34\n00:01:28,357 --> 00:01:32,431\nSo, this is why we want to look at\nencrypting the entire hard drive,\n\n35\n00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:35,366\nbecause somebody could\nsteal the drive itself.\n\n36\n00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:38,180\nSo, it's really gonna help us\nprotect against that theft.\n\n37\n00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,280\nAnother thing that can help us\nprotect with is drive disposal.\n\n38\n00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,676\nWhen you throw those hard drives away,\nand we try to sanitize them,\n\n39\n00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:47,655\nwe try to remove all the data from them.\n\n40\n00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:50,535\nBut we've seen there's some\nreally good recovery tools\n\n41\n00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:54,441\nout there that allow people to pull back\ndata that was deleted a long time ago.\n\n42\n00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:57,449\nThis is another layer of defense\nagainst something like that as well.\n\n43\n00:01:57,449 --> 00:01:59,533\nBecause if that drive's encrypted,\n\n44\n00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:03,580\nthey can't simply put it in another\ncomputer and try to remove that data.\n\n45\n00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,071\n>> Yeah, and this has become increasingly\nimportant as people buy laptops instead of\n\n46\n00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:10,000\ndesktops these days, right?\n\n47\n00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,680\nAnd Mike, you and me both,\nwe use laptops as our primary computers.\n\n48\n00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,790\nIf I have a desktop at home, it's not like\nI'm gonna leave my desktop on a cab or\n\n49\n00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,488\nlose my desktop at the airport.\n\n50\n00:02:19,488 --> 00:02:21,260\nBut a laptop, that happens.\n\n51\n00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,127\nBut somebody could break into my house and\nget that computer.\n\n52\n00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:26,751\nSo, encrypting the whole\ndisk is important really,\n\n53\n00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:29,449\nregardless of whether your\ncomputer is mobile or not.\n\n54\n00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,752\nPeople can get at that system.\n\n55\n00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:31,786\n>> Absolutely.\n\n56\n00:02:31,786 --> 00:02:35,668\nAnd from the IT perspective,\nwe're encrypting that entire hard drive.\n\n57\n00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:39,831\nWe can encrypt most operating system\nsupport file encryption where we can go in\n\n58\n00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:42,302\nand I can say, ooh,\nthis is a sensitive file.\n\n59\n00:02:42,302 --> 00:02:45,435\nIt's got passwords in there, it's got\npersonal identifiable information,\n\n60\n00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:47,410\ncredit card information,\nsomething like that.\n\n61\n00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:48,789\nWe can encrypt that file.\n\n62\n00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:53,323\nOr we can even encrypt an entire\nfolder of files if we choose to do so.\n\n63\n00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:56,597\nBut that means that I have\nto decide what's important,\n\n64\n00:02:56,597 --> 00:03:00,160\nwhat needs to be protected,\nwhat doesn't need to be.\n\n65\n00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,569\nIf we encrypt the entire hard drive,\neverything is protected, right?\n\n66\n00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:05,136\nThere is no deciding.\n\n67\n00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:06,663\nThere's no mistakes being made.\n\n68\n00:03:06,663 --> 00:03:10,450\nWe're going to encrypt it all,\neven temporary files that get created when\n\n69\n00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,260\nyou're working with your data,\nswap files, and things like that.\n\n70\n00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,834\nIt's all protected,\nbecause the entire drive is protected.\n\n71\n00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:22,613\n>> One of the things that I really like is\nthey've made this is painless as possible.\n\n72\n00:03:22,613 --> 00:03:24,479\nA lot of people here, oh,\nI gotta encrypt things.\n\n73\n00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,693\nThis is gonna be hard, right?\n\n74\n00:03:25,693 --> 00:03:27,583\nI got to do all sorts of\nstuff to get it working.\n\n75\n00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,607\nYou really don't.\n\n76\n00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:30,652\nMost operating systems, like Windows and\n\n77\n00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:35,050\nMac OS, have simple wizards you walk\nthrough that enable encrypting the drive.\n\n78\n00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,317\nAnd from then on, when you turn your\ncomputer on, you provide your password\n\n79\n00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:41,499\njust like normal, you log in,\nyou don't even realize it's encrypted.\n\n80\n00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:44,621\nMy laptop has been encrypted\nsince the day that I got it,\n\n81\n00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:49,019\nand I don't do anything differently than\nI would if my drive was unencrypted.\n\n82\n00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,835\nSo I get that level of protection\nwithout having to take any extra action.\n\n83\n00:03:52,835 --> 00:03:53,555\n>> Exactly.\nAnd\n\n84\n00:03:53,555 --> 00:03:58,552\nthey have really made it really easy for\nus to keep that data safe.\n\n85\n00:03:58,552 --> 00:04:02,712\nAnd basically, what's happening,\nthat entire drive is gonna get encrypted.\n\n86\n00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:06,961\nAnd as you said, it's a simple wizard that\nwe go through, and then, from then on,\n\n87\n00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:10,730\nwhen you boot that computer up,\nit's gonna decrypt that information and\n\n88\n00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,980\nit's going to pass it.\n\n89\n00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,064\nLike, let's say I double-click on a file,\nit's gonna decrypt that file,\n\n90\n00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:17,016\nthrow it out into memory\nwhere I can work with it.\n\n91\n00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:18,213\nI open it up with Word.\n\n92\n00:04:18,213 --> 00:04:20,139\nIt's all transparent to the end user.\n\n93\n00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:21,174\nThat's the thing.\n\n94\n00:04:21,174 --> 00:04:23,172\nWe don't have to do anything different.\n\n95\n00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:24,675\nI double-click on the file.\n\n96\n00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:26,510\nIt opens up just like normal.\n\n97\n00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,825\nI just type in data, I make changes to it.\n\n98\n00:04:28,825 --> 00:04:29,752\nI save it.\n\n99\n00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:33,290\nIt goes back to the hard drive and\nit gets encrypted all over again.\n\n100\n00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,080\nSo to the end user, to us,\nit makes no difference.\n\n101\n00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,346\nBut to the bad guy, if he tries to steal\nthat drive, it makes a big difference.\n\n102\n00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:43,204\nHe's not gonna be able to get access,\nwell, we shouldn't say not able to, but\n\n103\n00:04:43,204 --> 00:04:46,497\nit's gonna be very impractical that\nhe gets data off of that drive.\n\n104\n00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:47,958\n>> Yeah.\nWhat happens is that they turn,\n\n105\n00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:51,128\nlet's say it's a laptop, they steal\nmy laptop, and if they power it on,\n\n106\n00:04:51,128 --> 00:04:52,625\nthey'll get to the logon screen.\n\n107\n00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,593\nAnd, if they know my log on,\nthen they can log in.\n\n108\n00:04:54,593 --> 00:04:56,010\nThe encryption doesn't help them, right?\n\n109\n00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,143\n[LAUGH] So,\nyou do have to have basic security.\n\n110\n00:04:58,143 --> 00:05:01,519\nBut, if they don't know my password and\nthey rip this hard drive out and\n\n111\n00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,007\nthey stick it in their computer,\nit's encrypted.\n\n112\n00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:05,000\nThey can't get in.\n\n113\n00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,650\nYou have to provide a valid\npassword at that login screen,\n\n114\n00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,310\notherwise it doesn't decrypt,\ndoesn't know to do that.\n\n115\n00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,125\nSo that's a key component.\n\n116\n00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:15,295\nAnd because it's so simple,\nthere's really no reason not to do it.\n\n117\n00:05:15,295 --> 00:05:19,750\nOn modern computers, you should be\ndoing full disk encryption, all right?\n\n118\n00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,511\n>> And a lot of these will support\ndifferent methods for decrypting.\n\n119\n00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:26,255\nIn a corporate environment,\nit might be set up to auto unlock.\n\n120\n00:05:26,255 --> 00:05:28,404\nIf your organization uses smart cards,\n\n121\n00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:32,584\nit might be that you have to swipe your\nsmart card in order to unlock that drive.\n\n122\n00:05:32,584 --> 00:05:36,202\nSo, they've got different ways they\ncan provide that mechanism, but again,\n\n123\n00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,310\nit's really very simple, very easy.\n\n124\n00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,018\nOnce it's turned on, and\nturning it on is easy.\n\n125\n00:05:40,018 --> 00:05:42,394\nMost operating systems, as you said,\nhave something built in.\n\n126\n00:05:42,394 --> 00:05:45,584\nIn Windows,\nwe've got something called BitLocker.\n\n127\n00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:46,767\nThat's very easy to do.\n\n128\n00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:48,349\nIn fact, I can show you right now.\n\n129\n00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,055\nI've got a Windows 8.1 machine pulled up.\n\n130\n00:05:51,055 --> 00:05:52,742\nAnd I want to turn on BitLocker.\n\n131\n00:05:52,742 --> 00:05:56,543\nSo I've opened up my Control Panel, and\nI'm navigating my way into System and\n\n132\n00:05:56,543 --> 00:05:57,125\nSecurity.\n\n133\n00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:01,162\nIn fact, you can simply type in\nBitLocker up there in the search and\n\n134\n00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:02,470\nfind it very easily.\n\n135\n00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,564\nCome to this screen and\n\n136\n00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:06,510\nI can see the different drives\nI have available in my system.\n\n137\n00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,910\nNow, I want to protect my data drive.\n\n138\n00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,332\nThat's where I keep a lot of\nmy sensitive information.\n\n139\n00:06:11,332 --> 00:06:16,408\nSo, all I have to do is come over here and\nclick Turn On BitLocker.\n\n140\n00:06:16,408 --> 00:06:18,532\nIt's going to launch a little wizard, and\n\n141\n00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:21,549\nit's going to first ask me how\ndo I want to unlock this drive.\n\n142\n00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:24,110\nIn this case, I'm going to use a password.\n\n143\n00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,229\nI don't have a smart card, but in\na corporate environment where you've got\n\n144\n00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:29,732\nsmart card readers,\nmaybe you will want to use that option.\n\n145\n00:06:29,732 --> 00:06:33,380\nSo I'm just gonna provide\nthe password that I\n\n146\n00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,416\nwant to use twice to make\nsure I type it in the same.\n\n147\n00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:41,151\nAnd then,\nI'll continue on with our wizard.\n\n148\n00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,005\nAnd then, it's gonna give me\na couple of options here.\n\n149\n00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:46,538\nBecause it's gonna create\nwhat's called a Recovery Key.\n\n150\n00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:49,786\nOne thing we've got to keep in mind\nwhen we do full drive encryption,\n\n151\n00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:53,485\nthere's always the possibility that I'm\nunable to get back into that drive.\n\n152\n00:06:53,485 --> 00:06:56,323\nFor example, here, I'm setting a password.\n\n153\n00:06:56,323 --> 00:06:58,030\nWhat if I forget that password?\n\n154\n00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,890\nHow do I get back into that drive?\n\n155\n00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,682\nOr if I have to move this\ndrive to a different machine,\n\n156\n00:07:03,682 --> 00:07:07,665\nhow am I going to be able to get back in\nthat drive if I've lost that password?\n\n157\n00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:09,998\nSo I'm just gonna quickly\nsave this to a file.\n\n158\n00:07:09,998 --> 00:07:14,131\nYou get several different options,\nyou can print it out,\n\n159\n00:07:14,131 --> 00:07:16,249\nyou can send it to a USB drive.\n\n160\n00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:18,053\nIn a corporate environment,\n\n161\n00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:21,594\nI might even store that recovery\nkey in Active Directory.\n\n162\n00:07:21,594 --> 00:07:22,284\nSo I'll go ahead.\n\n163\n00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:25,182\n>> Be really careful with that though,\nbecause if somebody gets ahold of your\n\n164\n00:07:25,182 --> 00:07:27,219\nrecovery key,\nthey can decrypt your data, right?\n\n165\n00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:29,064\nThat's like the key to your house.\n\n166\n00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:30,303\nYou don't just leave it laying around.\n\n167\n00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,519\nMake sure you put it somewhere safe.\n\n168\n00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,318\n>> Absolutely.\n\n169\n00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,918\nAnd also not a good idea to keep it on\nthe same computer that you're enabling\n\n170\n00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:35,465\nBitLocker on.\n\n171\n00:07:35,465 --> 00:07:37,309\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Which I'm doing here.\n\n172\n00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:38,629\nNot a real good example, but\n\n173\n00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:41,662\nyou would want to make sure you\nhad it external from this machine.\n\n174\n00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:44,130\nAll right.\nSo I've taking care of my recovery key.\n\n175\n00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,350\nI'll click Next.\n\n176\n00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,485\nAnd it asks me am I ready to encrypt\nthis drive, and I'll go ahead and\n\n177\n00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:49,697\nclick Start Encrypting.\n\n178\n00:07:49,697 --> 00:07:51,403\nNow this particular drive is empty.\n\n179\n00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:54,165\nI've attached another drive to this\nmachine and we're encrypting it.\n\n180\n00:07:54,165 --> 00:07:57,853\nKeep in mind in the real world, if you're\ndoing this on a machine that you've\n\n181\n00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:01,541\nalready been using for some time, if\nyou've got a large amount of data on that\n\n182\n00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:05,090\ndrive, it could take a little while\nto do that encryption process.\n\n183\n00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,250\nWindows and most of the other ones will\nallow you to continue using the machine\n\n184\n00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,140\nwhile it's doing that encryption.\n\n185\n00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,320\nBut using it while it's doing that\nwill slow that process down as well.\n\n186\n00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,069\nSo it's something that\nyou've got to keep in mind.\n\n187\n00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:18,680\nYou don't want to do this when you're\nin the middle of a busy work day or\n\n188\n00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,537\nsomething like that.\n\n189\n00:08:19,537 --> 00:08:22,991\nAnd that's it, I can see that\nthe encryption of the E drive is complete.\n\n190\n00:08:22,991 --> 00:08:27,520\nSo if I look at my little icon, I can\nsee a lock, but it's currently unlocked.\n\n191\n00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,760\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm going\nto reboot this machine real quick.\n\n192\n00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,625\n>> So while he's rebooting his computer,\nlet me talk briefly about some of\n\n193\n00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:40,071\nthe other whole disk or full disk\nencryption products that are out there.\n\n194\n00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:43,664\nBitLocker is from Microsoft,\nyou certainly can use that.\n\n195\n00:08:43,664 --> 00:08:46,165\nThere are certain cases where\npeople don't like BitLocker, or\n\n196\n00:08:46,165 --> 00:08:47,237\nthey prefer other things.\n\n197\n00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:49,168\nThere's other vendors that are out there.\n\n198\n00:08:49,168 --> 00:08:52,674\nFor example, there's software\nlike VeraCrypt, which is an open\n\n199\n00:08:52,674 --> 00:08:56,948\nsource solution that's free, it supports\nWindows, Mac, and Linux, right?\n\n200\n00:08:56,948 --> 00:08:59,776\nSo, wide distribution there.\n\n201\n00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:03,010\nBitLocker is Microsoft only,\nso it's just in Windows.\n\n202\n00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,505\nIf you use Apple devices like Mac OS,\nyou've got FileVault is one, and\n\n203\n00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:09,256\nwe'll show FileVault here on\nthe show in a few minutes.\n\n204\n00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:11,200\nGive you chance to kind of see that one.\n\n205\n00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,078\nThere's a few other ones, right, Mike?\n\n206\n00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:12,922\n>> There are.\n\n207\n00:09:12,922 --> 00:09:16,723\nAnd it really just depends on what OS you\nhave, it kind of makes the decision of\n\n208\n00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,185\nwhat product you want to use, and\nwhether you want to pay for it or not.\n\n209\n00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:20,693\nAll right.\nSo,\n\n210\n00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:24,280\nthis system is finished rebooting, so\nlet's take a peek at what happened here.\n\n211\n00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,579\nSo if I open up File Explorer,\nI come back in,\n\n212\n00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:28,951\nbecause this machine's\nnot part of a domain.\n\n213\n00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:32,022\nIt's not a corporate machine.\n\n214\n00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:33,344\nIt's not part of a domain.\n\n215\n00:09:33,344 --> 00:09:34,762\nI don't have that auto unlock.\n\n216\n00:09:34,762 --> 00:09:38,464\nAnd also, this is a virtual machine which\nmakes a few changes in what hardware I\n\n217\n00:09:38,464 --> 00:09:39,318\nhave available.\n\n218\n00:09:39,318 --> 00:09:42,690\nBut anyway, come in here and\nI can see that in Windows Explorer,\n\n219\n00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,073\nmy lock icon has changed.\n\n220\n00:09:44,073 --> 00:09:47,446\nNow the little lock is closed,\nand the icon is gold.\n\n221\n00:09:47,446 --> 00:09:50,712\nAnd if I go to access this drive,\nit's not gonna let me,\n\n222\n00:09:50,712 --> 00:09:53,086\nit's gonna prompt me for the password.\n\n223\n00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:56,776\nSo this is where that password that I\nset when I first turned on BitLocker,\n\n224\n00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:57,738\nI need to provide.\n\n225\n00:09:57,738 --> 00:10:00,380\nSo as long as I've got that password,\nI can type that in.\n\n226\n00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,546\nAnd I hit Unlock.\n\n227\n00:10:03,546 --> 00:10:04,515\nAnd then, give it a second.\n\n228\n00:10:04,515 --> 00:10:08,312\nIt's gotta verify that password, and\nit's gotta actually do the decryption.\n\n229\n00:10:08,312 --> 00:10:11,161\nNow, all of the sudden, my lock is silver.\n\n230\n00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:14,551\nThe little lock is open, and\nI can double click on that drive, and\n\n231\n00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:15,917\nI can access it just fine.\n\n232\n00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:18,732\nI can save new files to it,\nwhatever I need to do.\n\n233\n00:10:18,732 --> 00:10:23,020\nSo that's what we meant earlier by the\nfact that it's really transparent to you.\n\n234\n00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,190\nAll you have to do is have the appropriate\npassword to decrypt that drive.\n\n235\n00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,861\n>> Yeah.\nAnd Mike,\n\n236\n00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,580\nyou encrypted a second\ndrive on your system.\n\n237\n00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,754\nIf he had encrypted the system drive,\nthe C drive, then it uses the password for\n\n238\n00:10:34,754 --> 00:10:36,264\nyour user account, right?\n\n239\n00:10:36,264 --> 00:10:39,130\nThat's what unlocks it, and so you\ndon't even see a second password field.\n\n240\n00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,041\nYou just log right in and that's that.\n\n241\n00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,018\nIt's pretty cool stuff.\n\n242\n00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:43,518\n>> Exactly.\n>> All right.\n\n243\n00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,371\nSo, that's about it for\n\n244\n00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:45,107\nBitLocker, right?\n\n245\n00:10:45,107 --> 00:10:45,692\n>> That is.\n\n246\n00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:46,583\nRight.\n>> All right.\n\n247\n00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:47,927\nSo, I've got a Mac here that\n\n248\n00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:50,850\njust has the base Yosemite\noperating system installed on it.\n\n249\n00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,432\nAnd the drivers are not encrypted or\n\n250\n00:10:52,432 --> 00:10:54,370\nanything like that.\nI want to turn it on, and\n\n251\n00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,860\nit's super simple, right?\nWe just go into our System Preferences,\n\n252\n00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,810\nand inside of here,\nwe've got Security and Privacy.\n\n253\n00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,094\nAnd inside of there,\nwe've got good old FileVault.\n\n254\n00:11:05,094 --> 00:11:05,988\nAnd I can click on FileVault.\n\n255\n00:11:05,988 --> 00:11:06,695\nAnd right now,\n\n256\n00:11:06,695 --> 00:11:10,100\nit's telling me that FileVault is\nturned off from my hard drive.\n\n257\n00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,092\nI can click the lock to\nunlock this setting page.\n\n258\n00:11:13,092 --> 00:11:17,020\nAnd once that is done,\nI'll have the option to turn on FileVault.\n\n259\n00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,100\nSimple as this.\n\n260\n00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,732\nWhen we go to turn it on, it's just gonna\nlet me know that it's going to encrypt\n\n261\n00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:25,415\nthe drive, and\nI need to have a recovery key.\n\n262\n00:11:25,415 --> 00:11:28,621\nJust like Mike saw with BitLocker,\nI create a recovery key here,\n\n263\n00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,267\nin case I forget my own password.\n\n264\n00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:32,357\nThis is how I'll be able to recover for\nthat.\n\n265\n00:11:32,357 --> 00:11:33,456\nSo I'll just hit Continue.\n\n266\n00:11:33,456 --> 00:11:37,118\nThere's my recovery key, and I can\nwrite that down on a piece of paper or\n\n267\n00:11:37,118 --> 00:11:39,023\nstore it wherever I need to store it.\n\n268\n00:11:39,023 --> 00:11:42,239\nBut I need to keep that safe\ncuz if somebody gets that key,\n\n269\n00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:43,715\nthey can decrypt my data.\n\n270\n00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,976\nAfter that, we move forward,\nand it's ready to go.\n\n271\n00:11:46,976 --> 00:11:50,388\nIt's going to restart this machine as\nit goes in and encrypts the drive.\n\n272\n00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:55,081\nNow, Mike didn't have to restart his,\nhe did that to show you the drive locking.\n\n273\n00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:58,190\nHe didn't have to restart cuz he didn't\nencrypt his operating system drive.\n\n274\n00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:02,120\nI am doing my operating system drive,\nthat's why it's got to restart for that.\n\n275\n00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,205\nBut when it restarts, this drive\nwill start the encryption process.\n\n276\n00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:08,250\nAnd it'll encrypt in the background.\n\n277\n00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,486\nAnd if I wait long enough,\nit'll take a good 10 or\n\n278\n00:12:10,486 --> 00:12:12,930\n15 minutes on this system cuz\nI have a lot of data on it.\n\n279\n00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,926\nWhen it's done encrypting, I'll be able\nlog in, access the system securely,\n\n280\n00:12:17,926 --> 00:12:22,562\nand I don't really see anything different\non my part as a regular end user.\n\n281\n00:12:22,562 --> 00:12:26,245\nI log in like normal, I work with\nthe system, and I'm in business.\n\n282\n00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,465\nSo, BitLocker, not hard to turn on.\n\n283\n00:12:29,465 --> 00:12:31,167\nFileVault, not hard to turn on.\n\n284\n00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:35,711\nWith each of these systems, they make\nit super easy because they know if they\n\n285\n00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,540\nmake it hard,\nend users won't do it, right?\n\n286\n00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,476\n>> [LAUGH] That's the thing is\nyou really see how easy it is.\n\n287\n00:12:42,476 --> 00:12:46,090\nIt sounds crazy, oh my gosh,\nI'm going to encrypt something.\n\n288\n00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,477\nWe start thinking about mathematical\nformulas, and keys, and things like this.\n\n289\n00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,355\nIt's just a matter of knowing where to go.\n\n290\n00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:55,071\nGoing through your system applets there,\nfind the option to turn it on, and\n\n291\n00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:56,185\nthen doing just that.\n\n292\n00:12:56,185 --> 00:13:00,153\nAnd the biggest thing you've gotta do is\nset a good strong password on it, and\n\n293\n00:13:00,153 --> 00:13:02,728\nthen make sure you keep\nthat recovery key secure.\n\n294\n00:13:02,728 --> 00:13:07,192\nCuz as Don said earlier, if I can get your\ncomputer, If I can get your hard drive,\n\n295\n00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:10,752\nand I can get that recovery key,\nthen I can decrypt it just fine.\n\n296\n00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:12,829\nSo that's gonna give me\naccess to the info, so\n\n297\n00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:15,080\nwe've gotta make sure\nwe're keeping that safe.\n\n298\n00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,680\nSo lots of different\nproducts we can choose,\n\n299\n00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,065\ndepending on the OS that you're\nrunning on your machine.\n\n300\n00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,702\nA few different options in there as far\nas how you want to go about unlocking\n\n301\n00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:23,357\nthat drive.\n\n302\n00:13:23,357 --> 00:13:25,616\nBut in the end, transparent to you.\n\n303\n00:13:25,616 --> 00:13:30,189\nOnce you get it turned on, you really\ndon't have much to do, and you're keeping\n\n304\n00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:34,920\nyour computer safe against the possibility\nof somebody stealing that hard drive.\n\n305\n00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,588\n>> All right.\nSo, the moral of the story is, if you can,\n\n306\n00:13:37,588 --> 00:13:40,135\nyou should encrypt\nthe drive of your system.\n\n307\n00:13:40,135 --> 00:13:42,449\nIt's easy to do,\nthere's no reason not to do it.\n\n308\n00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:45,420\nGet that system encrypted and\nget your system protected.\n\n309\n00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,582\nNow, you've protected yourself from\nthe physical theft of your device,\n\n310\n00:13:48,582 --> 00:13:49,849\nyour laptop, your desktop.\n\n311\n00:13:49,849 --> 00:13:52,280\nIf somebody rips out the hard drives,\nit's no big deal.\n\n312\n00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,713\nIf somebody steals your laptop,\n\n313\n00:13:53,713 --> 00:13:56,024\nyou can rest assured knowing\nyour data is still safe.\n\n314\n00:13:56,024 --> 00:13:59,210\nAnd that's something you can't\nsay if the drive is unencrypted.\n\n315\n00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,681\nPeople can get that data, and\nif you've got financial data,\n\n316\n00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:07,179\nmedical records on there, that can be\na big, at a minimum a PR debacle, right?\n\n317\n00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:07,702\n>> Absolutely.\n\n318\n00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:09,692\n>> But, really,\nyou're putting your customers and\n\n319\n00:14:09,692 --> 00:14:10,997\nclients at risk when you do that.\n\n320\n00:14:10,997 --> 00:14:12,840\n>> I can tell from a legal standpoint,\n\n321\n00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,466\nif you've gone through the trouble\nof doing this type of encryption,\n\n322\n00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:21,130\nthat can really help, even if somebody\ndoes somehow get access the information.\n\n323\n00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,280\nIf you can show that you have\ndone your due diligence and\n\n324\n00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,830\nyou've done that encryption, that can\nreduce the fines and things like that that\n\n325\n00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:31,328\nyou might face if some of that information\ngets leaked out to the public.\n\n326\n00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,425\n>> Yup, absolutely.\n\n327\n00:14:32,425 --> 00:14:34,105\nAll right.\nWell, Mike, I think we've covered whole\n\n328\n00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:35,976\ndisk encryption as much as we're\ngoing to be able to today.\n\n329\n00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:36,780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n330\n00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,559\nyou have anything else\nto throw in on that?\n\n331\n00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:39,880\n>> No, I think we're good.\n\n332\n00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,577\n>> All right.\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n333\n00:14:41,577 --> 00:14:44,348\nI hope you guys enjoyed the episode\nas much as we did filming it.\n\n334\n00:14:44,348 --> 00:14:47,698\nStay tuned, we've got more security\nfundamental episodes coming up.\n\n335\n00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:51,420\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n336\n00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,232\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n337\n00:14:52,232 --> 00:14:53,554\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n338\n00:14:53,554 -->

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,430\nI'm your host, Don Pezet,\nback with Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,410\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,420\n>> Oh, it's going well, Don.\n\n7\n00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,327\nI'm getting ready to do another exciting\nepisode of our security fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:22,327 --> 00:00:26,302\nAnd today we're gonna be talking\nabout Secure Sockets Layer,\n\n9\n00:00:26,302 --> 00:00:30,410\none of those things that we use\nprobably just about every day.\n\n10\n00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,520\nWe might not really\nunderstand what's going on or\n\n11\n00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,030\neven realize that we're using it, but\nwe use it all the time, don't we?\n\n12\n00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,820\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n13\n00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,780\nAnd if you've used the Internet for\na long time.\n\n14\n00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,650\nLike, I first started using\nthe Internet in about 1993,\n\n15\n00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,340\nand back then we didn't have a lot of the\nsecure technologies that we have today.\n\n16\n00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,600\nAnd so if you went to a Web site and you\npaid for something with your credit card,\n\n17\n00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,600\nright, or you sent personal information.\n\n18\n00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,370\nIt was normally just sent in plain\ntext right across the Internet.\n\n19\n00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,540\nAnd people realized pretty quickly that\nthat's not a great idea and that we need\n\n20\n00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,700\nways to do a few different things, right,\nand SSL is one of those technologies.\n\n21\n00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,470\nIt does a lot of different things\nto make sure that our connections\n\n22\n00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,690\nare nice and secure.\n\n23\n00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,280\n>> It really does.\n\n24\n00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,860\nSecure Socket Layer, what that's going\nto do is it's going to encrypt or\n\n25\n00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,190\nallow us to encrypt that traffic\nas we send it across the network.\n\n26\n00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,379\nSo as Don was saying,\nwhen you're doing your online banking,\n\n27\n00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:24,589\nyou're connecting to your bank.\n\n28\n00:01:24,589 --> 00:01:28,123\nOr if you're going out to Amazon or\nBest Buy online and you want to purchase\n\n29\n00:01:28,123 --> 00:01:31,800\nsomething, you want to put your\ncredit card information over there.\n\n30\n00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,410\nWe're gonna SSL, it's gonna help us\nmake sure that that information can't\n\n31\n00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,030\nbe intercepted by the bad\nguys that are out there.\n\n32\n00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,460\nWhat it ends up doing is allows us to make\na secure connection, typically between\n\n33\n00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,570\na client and a server, like in the example\nof a web server, could be a mail server.\n\n34\n00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:51,140\nMaybe your Outlook client has got a secure\nconnection back to the mail server.\n\n35\n00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,930\nIt's even used in some\nof our VPN technologies.\n\n36\n00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,280\nWhen you VPN back into\nwork from that hotel or\n\n37\n00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,250\nfrom Starbucks you can use one of\nthe newer protocols that travels over SSL.\n\n38\n00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,645\nSo like you say,\nit is used in a lot of places, and for\n\n39\n00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:07,485\nthe most part it's transparent.\n\n40\n00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:09,365\nWhen it's working correctly,\n\n41\n00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:14,167\nwe will show you guys how we can tell when\nwe have a secure connection established,\n\n42\n00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:17,510\nbut we really don't have\nto do anything on our end.\n\n43\n00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,196\nIt's the other end, the web server,\n\n44\n00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:21,470\nthe mail server that really\ndoes most of the setup.\n\n45\n00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,674\nAnd then our browsers,\nwhatever application we're using\n\n46\n00:02:24,674 --> 00:02:29,070\nthat supports SSL takes care of\neverything for us in the background.\n\n47\n00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,820\n>> Now, Mike,\nyou mentioned encryption, and\n\n48\n00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,910\nthat's obviously a big\npart of what SSL does.\n\n49\n00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,950\nIt's probably the most important part,\nto be honest with you.\n\n50\n00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,590\nBut it does some other things,\n\n51\n00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,820\nlike we can use it to validate\nidentities which is pretty important.\n\n52\n00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,560\nEspecially when you're\ngoing to a Web site and\n\n53\n00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,270\nyou're about to send personal information,\n\n54\n00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,470\nyou want to make sure that Web site\nis the site you think it is, right?\n\n55\n00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,810\n>> Absolutely, I don't want to\nhave an encrypted connection\n\n56\n00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,500\nto the bad guys' version of Bank\nof America's web server, right?\n\n57\n00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,410\nSo not only do I want to protect my data\nas it's traveling across the network,\n\n58\n00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,100\nI want to ensure that I'm connecting to\nthe server I'm thinking I'm connecting to,\n\n59\n00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,040\nand SSL takes care of that.\n\n60\n00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,360\nIt uses something called certificates,\nwhich are basically electronic documents\n\n61\n00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,060\nthat get issued to these\ndifferent servers.\n\n62\n00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,790\nThere's several companies out\nthere that you can go and\n\n63\n00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,530\nyou can purchase a certificate prompt,\nand again it's an electronic document.\n\n64\n00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,510\nSo if I want to run a website and\n\n65\n00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,870\nI want to allow people to connect\nto that Web site securely.\n\n66\n00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,657\nI go to someplace like Fox or Verisign or\nEquifax or GTE, and I buy a certificate.\n\n67\n00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:33,253\nAnd I'm going to have to prove to them\nwho I am before they issue me that\n\n68\n00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:34,770\ncertificate, right?\n\n69\n00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,576\nAnd then once I've installed it on my\nserver, when you go to my web server and\n\n70\n00:03:38,576 --> 00:03:42,515\nwant to buy my product, your computer's\ngoing to request that certificate.\n\n71\n00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:45,157\nAnd it's going to look\nat that certificate and\n\n72\n00:03:45,157 --> 00:03:48,010\nmake sure that the information\non there is valid.\n\n73\n00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,040\nThere are several things that it's\nactually going to look at and\n\n74\n00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,100\nwe'll show you here an example.\n\n75\n00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,742\nIn fact,\nI can pull one right up right now.\n\n76\n00:03:53,742 --> 00:03:58,850\nWe can take a look at my screen here,\nthis is our logon page here at ITProTV.\n\n77\n00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,030\nAnd I can see that I've\ngot this nice green bar.\n\n78\n00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,920\nI'm using Internet Explorer,\nI've got a nice green bar across the top.\n\n79\n00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,770\nYou'll notice that the URL\nbegins with HTTPS, right?\n\n80\n00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,800\nThat S gives me that secure connection.\n\n81\n00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,150\nThe green is telling me that I've\ngot a successful, secure connection.\n\n82\n00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,330\nThere's actually a couple of different\ntypes of secure connections we can make.\n\n83\n00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,818\nYou've got your extended verification,\n\n84\n00:04:21,818 --> 00:04:24,660\ndifferent browsers display\nit different ways.\n\n85\n00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,770\nInternet Explorer is going to\nshow you a green address bar for\n\n86\n00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,560\nthe extended verification.\n\n87\n00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,240\nIf it's just a normal verification,\n\n88\n00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,100\nthen it's just gonna have that lock\nup there without the green bar.\n\n89\n00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,670\n>> And you mentioned verification,\nwhat they're doing there is,\n\n90\n00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:42,380\nif I want to go and buy a certificate,\nright, I could go to DigiCert's web page.\n\n91\n00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,850\nAnd I could tell them\nthe URL I wanted to secure and\n\n92\n00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,620\nall they do is they ask me to verify\nthat I actually have that domain.\n\n93\n00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,310\nAnd the way they do it is, if I try and\nbuy a certificate for itpro.tv,\n\n94\n00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,440\nthey send an email to admin@itpro.tv.\n\n95\n00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,150\nAnd if we get that email in reply to it,\n\n96\n00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,970\nthen they know that we must\nhave control of that domain.\n\n97\n00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,750\nAnd if we don't get that email then\nwe must not control the domain and\n\n98\n00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,320\nthey won't issue it.\n\n99\n00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,040\nThat's the normal verification.\n\n100\n00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,100\nBut email,\n\n101\n00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,760\nthat's only so much as far as verifying\nwhether somebody truly owns a domain.\n\n102\n00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,260\nSo extended verification goes further.\n\n103\n00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,760\nThey'll ask for\nthings like your bank documents\n\n104\n00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,020\nto show that you have a bank\naccount under your company name.\n\n105\n00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,680\nOr they'll ask for other documentation\nlike your letters of incorporation,\n\n106\n00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,060\nyour business registration, so that you\ncan prove that you are that business.\n\n107\n00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,500\nAnd so when you see a site that\nhas the full green bar up there,\n\n108\n00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,680\nthat lets you know they did the EV,\nextended validation.\n\n109\n00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,110\nAnd you know that's the actual\ncompany at that point.\n\n110\n00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,070\nIf you just see the lock icon and\n\n111\n00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,210\nnot the green bar,\nthat means they did the basic validation.\n\n112\n00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,550\nAnd honestly it is good enough for\nmost things.\n\n113\n00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,820\nBut if it's a bank, if it's medical\nrecords, you want to know that it's\n\n114\n00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,175\nabsolutely the company that you think\nit is, and that's where EV comes in.\n\n115\n00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:58,410\n>> Exactly, because there's always a\npossibility somebody intercepts an email,\n\n116\n00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,700\nforges emails and things like that, so\nwe really do have to worry about that.\n\n117\n00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,440\nSo if we go back over\nhere to my screen again,\n\n118\n00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,330\nwe'll see that at ITProTV\nwe've got a certificate.\n\n119\n00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,180\nAnd I clicked on the little lock\nhere in Internet Explorer, and\n\n120\n00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,010\nthat pulls up some basic information.\n\n121\n00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,170\nI can see website identification.\n\n122\n00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:17,050\nDigicert has identified this site\nas Edutainment Live, Gainesville,\n\n123\n00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,800\nFlorida, etc., etc.\n\n124\n00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,720\nIf I click on View Certificate,\nnow I can see the actual certificate.\n\n125\n00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,040\nAnd, again, the things we're looking for,\nthings that are going to make sure\n\n126\n00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,860\nthe certificate is valid,\na few things it'll look at.\n\n127\n00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,300\nFirst of all, who it's issued to.\n\n128\n00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,373\nIn this line it says, issued to ITProTV.\n\n129\n00:06:35,373 --> 00:06:40,781\nAnd if I look up at my URL, that indeed\nis where I'm going to, ITPro.tv.\n\n130\n00:06:40,781 --> 00:06:45,448\nIf those names don't match, if that\ncertificate is issued to a different name,\n\n131\n00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:46,970\nthat can cause a problem.\n\n132\n00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,690\nThat will cause a certificate\nto be recognized as invalid and\n\n133\n00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,310\nit will pop up some warnings, which\nwe're going to show you in a little bit.\n\n134\n00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,300\nSo that name has to match.\n\n135\n00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,030\nAlso, we can see who it's issued by.\n\n136\n00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,542\nThis one was issued by\na company called DigiCert.\n\n137\n00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:06,596\nIt's important that we trust the people\nthat are issuing these certificates.\n\n138\n00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:09,979\nDigiCert is a company out there that\nyou can go to their website and\n\n139\n00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:13,746\nyou can buy a certificate from, and\nthere's several of them out there.\n\n140\n00:07:13,746 --> 00:07:16,955\nIn fact, I'll pull up the list for you.\n\n141\n00:07:16,955 --> 00:07:18,835\nIn a second I'll show up a list and\n\n142\n00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:22,490\nshow you some of the ones that\nmy browser knows to trust.\n\n143\n00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,770\nBut we wanna make sure it's coming\nfrom a trusted party, right?\n\n144\n00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,920\nBecause what's to stop me, I could\nsetup my own certificate authority.\n\n145\n00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,260\nThat's a server that can\ngenerate these certificates.\n\n146\n00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,780\nAnd I could issue myself a certificate,\nrun a Web site,\n\n147\n00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,360\nassign that certificate to the Web site.\n\n148\n00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,850\nYou come to it,\nyour computer is going to say,\n\n149\n00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,200\nhey web server, give me your certificate.\n\n150\n00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,385\nIt does, it hands it over and\nIt says issued by Mike CA.\n\n151\n00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:49,508\nWell your computer shouldn't\ntrust Mike CA, right?\n\n152\n00:07:49,508 --> 00:07:52,612\nSo you've got to make sure that these\ncertificates are coming from a trusted\n\n153\n00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:53,687\ncertificate authority.\n\n154\n00:07:53,687 --> 00:07:56,463\nAnd they also have to be valid,\nthey're not good forever.\n\n155\n00:07:56,463 --> 00:07:59,532\nDepending on how much you spend and\nthe type of certificate that you're\n\n156\n00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:02,000\npurchasing they'll have\ndifferent validity periods.\n\n157\n00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,165\nAnd we can see here,\nthis one is good until January 5th, 2016.\n\n158\n00:08:06,165 --> 00:08:10,150\nIt's another thing that could cause\nmy browser to pop up a warning.\n\n159\n00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,180\nSo any one of those can cause a problem or\ncan give me a warning.\n\n160\n00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,500\nIf the name doesn't match, the certificate\ndoesn't match the URL I'm navigating to.\n\n161\n00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:23,875\nIf the issuing party is not somebody that\nI trust or if the certificate is expired.\n\n162\n00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:27,210\nAnd sometimes it usually, you know,\nit indicates that there's a problem.\n\n163\n00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,900\nNot always a bad thing, right?\n\n164\n00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,680\nThere are times when a certificate is\nused to a certain name and unless,\n\n165\n00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,340\nsay we change the name of that server, or\n\n166\n00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,980\nif I connect to that machine via\nIP address instead of by name.\n\n167\n00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,860\nWell that IP address is not listed\nmaybe on the certificate, and\n\n168\n00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,670\nI can generate a problem.\n\n169\n00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,070\nAlthough today a lot of the certificates\nthey can use wildcards,\n\n170\n00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,060\nthey can also have multiple names in\nthere that it would be valid for.\n\n171\n00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,960\n>> And we do have to be a little\nbit careful when you go to a web\n\n172\n00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,300\nsite that fails one of these checks.\n\n173\n00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,310\nAnd your web browser does all three\nchecks every time it hits a secure page.\n\n174\n00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,260\nIf any one of those,\nfail it gives an error message.\n\n175\n00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,010\nAnd a lot of the browsers give you\nthe option to continue past the error.\n\n176\n00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:10,910\nAnd, if you do that,\n\n177\n00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,760\nyou will actually encrypt your\nsession using that certificate.\n\n178\n00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,620\nYou actually do get encryption but the\nwhole purpose of those errors is they're\n\n179\n00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,420\ntrying to let you know that\nit might be compromised.\n\n180\n00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,610\nYou gave example, Mike,\nof it might be from MikeCA.\n\n181\n00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,050\nWe don't trust MikeCA,\nwho the heck is that?\n\n182\n00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,750\nIf it's expired.\n\n183\n00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,220\nWell, the problem with\nthe expiration date is not so\n\n184\n00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,540\nmuch the certificate itself but\nencryption.\n\n185\n00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,250\nThe way encryption works is your data\nis encrypted with the private key, and\n\n186\n00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,790\nthat key is really, really hard to guess.\n\n187\n00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:44,600\nWell, the longer somebody has to guess the\nhigher their odds are guessing correctly.\n\n188\n00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,780\nSo if that key is ten years old,\n\n189\n00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,970\nthat means attackers have\nhad ten years to work on it.\n\n190\n00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,930\nAnd they've probably figured it out,\nright.\n\n191\n00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:54,510\nBut most people just get certificates\nthat are valid for one year.\n\n192\n00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,630\nAnd every year they get a new certificate.\n\n193\n00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,050\nWhich changes that key and makes it\nnear impossible for anybody to guess.\n\n194\n00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,890\nYou can always get lucky, right?\n\n195\n00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,400\nBut the odds are really\nstacked against them.\n\n196\n00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,590\nThe upper limit would probably be three\nyears when you browse around on the web.\n\n197\n00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,890\nYou can buy certificates that will last\nlonger, it's just not the greatest idea.\n\n198\n00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,210\n>> Exactly.\n\n199\n00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,580\nAll right, so let's take a look here.\n\n200\n00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,180\nI'm going to show you next,\nI'm going to use Internet Explorer.\n\n201\n00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,100\nI'm going to pull up my options and\n\n202\n00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,540\nI'm going to head on over to my content\ntab and then click on certificates.\n\n203\n00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,220\nAnd in here, I've got a list of trusted\nroot certification authorities.\n\n204\n00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,490\nThese are all those third parties out\nthere that you can go or that companies\n\n205\n00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:39,410\ncan go to and purchase certificates, and\nmy computer already knows to trust these.\n\n206\n00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,770\nThese are companies that have\nbeen in business for a while.\n\n207\n00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,170\nMicrosoft has included\nthem in their settings and\n\n208\n00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,620\nthe other browsers do the same thing.\n\n209\n00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,000\nFirefox, Chrome,\nMozilla all those do the same thing.\n\n210\n00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,180\nThey've got a list of people\nthat they already trust.\n\n211\n00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,990\nSo if I go to a web site and\n\n212\n00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,110\nthey've purchased their certificate from\none of these vendors then my computer is\n\n213\n00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,560\ngoing to trust the certificate assuming\neverything else is still correct, right?\n\n214\n00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,620\nThat the name matches the URL\nthat I'm connecting to and\n\n215\n00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,150\nthe certificate is still valid.\n\n216\n00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,400\n>> And you mention who it is that\npicking those certificates and\n\n217\n00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,430\nit does vary based on the browser, right?\n\n218\n00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,540\nIt's a company that you trust,\nhopefully like Microsoft or\n\n219\n00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,210\nGoogle and they decide,\nsome of the CAs that are out there.\n\n220\n00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:22,350\nThat means there can be differences\nbetween browsers, actually some well\n\n221\n00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,780\ndocumented ones, where Google doesn't\ntrust a company but Apple does.\n\n222\n00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,670\nAnd so if you go to a certain website\nwith Google Chrome, it throws an error.\n\n223\n00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,780\nYou go with Apple Safari and it's fine.\n\n224\n00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,200\nRight, so that does happen sometimes but\nyou have control over.\n\n225\n00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,270\nMike, your list right there,\nyou could actually add more root CAs or\n\n226\n00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,710\ntake some out if you wanted to, right?\n\n227\n00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,050\n>> Absolutely.\nI'm gonna pull those back up there, and\n\n228\n00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,700\nget back to my content, my certificates.\n\n229\n00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,350\nWe can definitely import.\n\n230\n00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,710\nLike, if you've seen this sometimes,\nDon, in smaller organizations.\n\n231\n00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,440\nThey want to set up like\na secure mail server so\n\n232\n00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,840\nthat people can check their mail\nfrom outside of the organization.\n\n233\n00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,430\nSo they set up their own\ncertificate authority,\n\n234\n00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,860\nbecause they don't have the resources\nmaybe to go purchase a certificate.\n\n235\n00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,800\nSo they set up their own, and they issue\nthat certificate to their mail server.\n\n236\n00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,240\nAnd then what they do is,\nthey tell all of their employees,\n\n237\n00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,060\nlook you're going to get a warning\nwhen you connect to this server.\n\n238\n00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,210\nAnd it's going to give you the option\nto continue as well as install\n\n239\n00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,790\nthe root certificate.\n\n240\n00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,730\nAnd you can choose to trust it.\n\n241\n00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,780\nYou've gotta be really careful\nwith that option though.\n\n242\n00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,050\nIf my company tells me hey,\n\n243\n00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:28,820\nthis is our certificate,\nit's safe to trust it, maybe that's okay.\n\n244\n00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,330\nBut if I'm going to just\nsome random website and\n\n245\n00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,570\nI get that error,\nI don't wanna trust that certificate.\n\n246\n00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:38,210\nBecause if I do, if I import that\ncertificate into my trusted roots,\n\n247\n00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:41,880\nthat means I now trust every\ncertificate that they issue.\n\n248\n00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,620\nAnd that can open up me\nup to a lot of issues.\n\n249\n00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,125\n>> Yeah, absolutely and it's happened,\nit's unfortunate where one of those root\n\n250\n00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,980\nTAs gets compromised and people\nstarted to fix that shouldn't happen.\n\n251\n00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,830\nWhen that happens, your vendor, Microsoft\nor Google or Apple, whoever should revoke\n\n252\n00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:02,210\nthat certificate that root TA so you\ndon't trust those malicious certificates.\n\n253\n00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,480\n>> In fact, there used to be one, Don.\n\n254\n00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,535\nIt's gone now, I guess it's been\na little too long they removed it, but.\n\n255\n00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:11,510\nHere back in my Internet options,\nI can see an Untrusted Publishers tab.\n\n256\n00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,095\nAnd there used to be one that was\nlisted in there, I think it's been so\n\n257\n00:13:14,095 --> 00:13:15,950\nlong now that they don't worry about it.\n\n258\n00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,050\nBut that's exactly what would happen.\n\n259\n00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,929\nIf one of those CAs gets compromised,\none of those certificate authorities gets\n\n260\n00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:24,749\ncompromised, we can add them or it can be\nadded through maybe Windows Updates or\n\n261\n00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:27,160\nsomething like that to\nmy untrusted publishers.\n\n262\n00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,498\nAnd now my computer will no longer\ntrust any certificates issued by\n\n263\n00:13:31,498 --> 00:13:34,670\nthat particular certificate authority.\n\n264\n00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,510\nNow I know we had DigiNotar a couple\nyears ago which was I think they were\n\n265\n00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,870\nout of the Netherlands.\n\n266\n00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,590\nMore recently we had CNNIC,\nwhich was out of China.\n\n267\n00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,020\nThat was the one that Google revoked but\nApple didn't.\n\n268\n00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,710\nSo, it happens, they usually work to\nfix whatever their problem was and\n\n269\n00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,550\nget reinstated pretty quickly.\n\n270\n00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,705\nSo you'd expect that list to be empty, but\n\n271\n00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:56,195\nunfortunately in this world all\nsorts of things can happen.\n\n272\n00:13:56,195 --> 00:13:57,425\n>> They do.\nAll right, so\n\n273\n00:13:57,425 --> 00:14:00,605\nnow let's take a look at what it\nlooks like when I go to a site that's\n\n274\n00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:01,695\nnot secure.\n\n275\n00:14:01,695 --> 00:14:04,335\nSo if we flip back over to my screen here,\nwe saw ITProTV.\n\n276\n00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:05,908\nIt's in HTTPS, and\n\n277\n00:14:05,908 --> 00:14:11,375\nwe've got that nice green bar giving\nus that extended verification.\n\n278\n00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:16,190\nI flip over to another page here,\nI've just navigated to a site,\n\n279\n00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,130\nhtpps://dell.com.\n\n280\n00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,410\nNow, this is not,\nobviously Dell's a trusted vendor, and\n\n281\n00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,670\nthis particular site,\nI'm not using the right URL.\n\n282\n00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,680\nAnd I'm doing that intentionally here.\n\n283\n00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,920\nBut what I can see is, I've got\na big fat red or white x over here.\n\n284\n00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,310\nThere's a problem with this\nwebsite's security certificate.\n\n285\n00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,410\nAnd it's given me a couple\nbits of information.\n\n286\n00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:41,320\nThe security certificate presented by\nthis website was not issued by a trusted\n\n287\n00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,250\ncertificate authority.\n\n288\n00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,780\nSo the certificate came from somebody\nthat's not in my list, right.\n\n289\n00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,750\nMy computer looked at it, it got\nthe certificate, connected to Dell, said,\n\n290\n00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,310\nhey, give me your certificate.\n\n291\n00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,420\nDell presented it, and\nit saw who it was signed by.\n\n292\n00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,410\nIt looked in that list of trusted\ncertificate authorities, and\n\n293\n00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,330\nthey weren't in there.\n\n294\n00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:04,210\nSo it's telling me, hey, I don't know\nif you can trust the certificate.\n\n295\n00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,380\nAlso says that, it tells me that it might\nbe an attempt to fool me, all right.\n\n296\n00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:13,030\nBut it does give me the option to continue\nto the website (not recommended).\n\n297\n00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,410\nIn the real world,\n\n298\n00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:18,260\nyou get something like this, that you\nshouldn't go to the website, right.\n\n299\n00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,090\nIf you do go to the website,\n\n300\n00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,060\ndefinitely don't put any personally\nidentifiable information there.\n\n301\n00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,080\nDon't be trying to log on,\ndon't put any credit card numbers in there\n\n302\n00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,225\nI have gone to some sites, Don,\nwhere I I knew the certificate was, and\n\n303\n00:15:30,225 --> 00:15:33,005\nyou get the big warning,\nI continue anyway, just because I was\n\n304\n00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:36,585\nlooking at a couple of things and wasn't\nplanning on submitting any information.\n\n305\n00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:40,125\nIf I do continue,\nwe get to see another type of error.\n\n306\n00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,799\nIf I go ahead and continue this website.\n\n307\n00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:46,036\nThis is another common one that we'll run\ninto, where you get to a screen like this,\n\n308\n00:15:46,036 --> 00:15:48,781\nand depending on your browser,\nyou might get a pop up or\n\n309\n00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,414\nyou might get a little warning.\n\n310\n00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:55,014\nDown across the bottom here it says\nonly secure content is displayed.\n\n311\n00:15:55,014 --> 00:15:59,591\nOther browsers might say things like some\nof the content is insecure or there's\n\n312\n00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:03,840\na mix of secure and insecure content and\ngive you the option to display it.\n\n313\n00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,600\nSo, and what Internet Explorer is doing,\nis it's saying, all right,\n\n314\n00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,460\nsome of this content is not secure.\n\n315\n00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,243\nA lot of times it's scripts or\nimages where the UR, and\n\n316\n00:16:12,243 --> 00:16:16,009\nthis has to do with the coders, so\nit's not anything we have to deal with.\n\n317\n00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:19,051\nBut in the background, the HTML code for\n\n318\n00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:25,440\nthe web page might be pointing to a normal\nHTTP link to pull an image or a graphic.\n\n319\n00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,180\nAnd so it's telling me, hey, look, this\nis supposed to be a secure connection.\n\n320\n00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,800\nI'm gonna show you all the secure stuff.\n\n321\n00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,750\nIf it's insecure I'm just gonna hide it.\n\n322\n00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,930\nI can choose to show all content,\nwhere it goes ahead and\n\n323\n00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,700\ndisplays both the secure and\nthe non-secure.\n\n324\n00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,790\nIt is something though that you've got to\nworry about cuz there could be something\n\n325\n00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,560\non that page that's malicious or\ncould grab some of your information.\n\n326\n00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,810\n>> Yeah the fear there is\nyou go to some web page,\n\n327\n00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:53,860\nmaybe it's like a shopping cart or\nsomething and it shows as SSL.\n\n328\n00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,960\nYou got the little green bar at top,\nit looks like it's secure.\n\n329\n00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,950\nBut in it maybe they embed the order form,\nand the order form's not secure.\n\n330\n00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,440\nYou think it's secure, but this actual\nlittle field on the page isn't,\n\n331\n00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,770\nand you're transmitting\ndata in plain text.\n\n332\n00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,330\nIt creates the illusion of security\nwithout actually providing security, so\n\n333\n00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,550\nthat's why the browsers detect that and\nthey warn you.\n\n334\n00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:20,480\nAnd on Firefox, on Internet Explorer,\nyou can just continue right on.\n\n335\n00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,380\nGoogle took the hard line recently and\nin Chrome they won't let you do it.\n\n336\n00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,110\nThey won't let you view\nthat non-secure content.\n\n337\n00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:29,050\nYou just see the secure stuff and\nyou actually have to go dig way deep in\n\n338\n00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,850\nthe browser options to enable it to\neven be able to get beyond that.\n\n339\n00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,310\nSo most vendors have\ngotten better about that.\n\n340\n00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,055\nIn this case,\n\n341\n00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:39,790\nwe'll defend Dell a little bit because\nthey are a massive corporation, the reason\n\n342\n00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:44,250\nthis is all going on is, there is no\nsensitive information on their home page.\n\n343\n00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,310\nAnd so\nthere's no need to secure the home page.\n\n344\n00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:51,040\nIf you go to it without https,\nyou see their home page just fine.\n\n345\n00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,410\nBut the moment you click Sign In to go to\nsomething secure, then you flip over to\n\n346\n00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,060\ndifferent servers that are secure, and\nyou don't have certificate errors, right?\n\n347\n00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,110\nYou are protected once you get there, and\n\n348\n00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,980\nso that's why we see this kind of\nerror on a company as big as Dell.\n\n349\n00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,520\nAnd it's just because we're\nmanipulating that a little bit.\n\n350\n00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,210\n>> Exactly, we're gonna kinda show\nyou some of the things that happen\n\n351\n00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,390\nwhen it goes wrong.\n\n352\n00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,950\nSo as Don said, as soon as I click\nLogin I come to the login screen, and\n\n353\n00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,430\nI can see I've got my\nlittle lock icon up there.\n\n354\n00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,740\nIf I click on it I can view\nthe certificate and everything's valid.\n\n355\n00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,205\nIt's issued by Dell,\nit's issued by Digisearch, who I trust,\n\n356\n00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,724\nas well as being valid, so.\n\n357\n00:18:27,724 --> 00:18:29,822\n>> Yeah, and\nthere's why you got your original errors.\n\n358\n00:18:29,822 --> 00:18:33,303\nSee how that certificate\nis issued to www.dell.com?\n\n359\n00:18:33,303 --> 00:18:38,803\nBut when Mike first fired it up\nhe just went to https://dell.com.\n\n360\n00:18:38,803 --> 00:18:40,143\nHe left the www off.\n\n361\n00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:42,223\nThe names didn't match, right?\n\n362\n00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:43,842\nThat's what threw that original error,\n\n363\n00:18:43,842 --> 00:18:45,563\neven before he moved\nthrough into the site.\n\n364\n00:18:45,563 --> 00:18:48,963\n>> Exactly, exactly, all right, so\nI'll show you another one here.\n\n365\n00:18:48,963 --> 00:18:53,050\nIf I flip over to,\nI've got Mozilla Firefox installed.\n\n366\n00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:56,890\nI went to the same page and\nas Don said I left out the WWW so\n\n367\n00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,540\nthe names wouldn't match,\nand I get that same warning.\n\n368\n00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,590\nA little different format,\n\n369\n00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,540\na little different layout,\nbut in the end, same things.\n\n370\n00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,260\nIt's telling me that, hey,\n\n371\n00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,010\nsomething is wrong,\ncan't confirm the connection is secure.\n\n372\n00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,750\nI can click on technical details and\nI'll see the same info.\n\n373\n00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:17,770\nThere's an invalid security certificate\nassigned to that, the issuer is unknown.\n\n374\n00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,620\nI can click on, I understand the risks.\n\n375\n00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,420\nThey won't let me continue to the site.\n\n376\n00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,950\nThere might be an option,\nI'm not a big Firefox user,\n\n377\n00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,020\nbut there might be an option\nsomewhere where I can allow that.\n\n378\n00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,050\nWhat they want me to do\nis add an exception, and\n\n379\n00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,720\nthat's the one I was telling you guys\nwe've got to be really careful with.\n\n380\n00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,050\nBecause if I add an exception,\nit'll start accepting these.\n\n381\n00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,970\nWhoever did issue the certificate,\n\n382\n00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,310\nit could end up adding\nthem to a trusted root.\n\n383\n00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,845\nHopefully Firefox will just add this one,\nand\n\n384\n00:19:43,845 --> 00:19:47,175\nit would a be a little more specific than\nthat, but I really want to be careful.\n\n385\n00:19:48,915 --> 00:19:50,265\nUnless I know for\n\n386\n00:19:50,265 --> 00:19:54,405\nsure that I can trust them,\nI want to avoid doing those exceptions.\n\n387\n00:19:54,405 --> 00:19:57,540\n>> Right, because what could\nhave happened is an attacker\n\n388\n00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:02,090\ncould have found some way to redirect your\ntraffic from Dell's website in this case,\n\n389\n00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,690\nto one of their own servers.\n\n390\n00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,110\nAnd if you just say, you know what,\ngo ahead and trust that, it's Dell.\n\n391\n00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:10,910\nWell, you're actually accessing a copy of\nDell's website on this attacker server.\n\n392\n00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,350\nAnd now any information you type in,\nthey're gathering.\n\n393\n00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,430\nSo you think you're placing an order with\nDell, you type in your credit card, and\n\n394\n00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,470\nyou're just sending that to the attacker.\n\n395\n00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:24,020\nThat's identity theft for computers, so\nit's not like a human victim necessarily,\n\n396\n00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,880\nbut basically,\nthey can masquerade as that server.\n\n397\n00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,972\nSo, SSL really doing two things for us.\n\n398\n00:20:30,972 --> 00:20:35,640\nOne, verifying that identity,\nmaking sure we know who that server is,\n\n399\n00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,540\nthat it actually is\nthe server we think it is.\n\n400\n00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,230\nAnd two, encrypting our data in transit.\n\n401\n00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:43,315\nSo, if somebody intercepts that they won't\nbe able to read it to see what's going on.\n\n402\n00:20:43,315 --> 00:20:49,610\n>> Exactly, and SSL really is, without it,\nE-commerce as we know it wouldn't exist.\n\n403\n00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,800\nWe wouldn't be able to go\nshopping at all these places.\n\n404\n00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,070\nI wouldn't be able to do my online\nbanking and things like that.\n\n405\n00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,140\nSo SSL has really made all\nof that stuff possible.\n\n406\n00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:03,648\nI will show you one more thing if I\ngo to and just to clear up Dell here.\n\n407\n00:21:03,648 --> 00:21:07,136\nwww.dell.com.\n\n408\n00:21:09,136 --> 00:21:11,516\nAnd here I can see just\na different browser.\n\n409\n00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:16,040\nAnd, actually let me leave out their S,\nsorry.\n\n410\n00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,820\nGet to their site and\nthen head on over to their login page.\n\n411\n00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,170\nAnd there's their\nofficial site with a www.\n\n412\n00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:29,080\nAnd I just wanted to show you\nhow Firefox does it for you.\n\n413\n00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,300\nYou all see the green bar?\n\n414\n00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,330\nI do have a little\nexclamation point over here.\n\n415\n00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:35,025\nIt does not supply identity information,\nthat's interesting.\n\n416\n00:21:35,025 --> 00:21:38,150\n>> Uh-oh, did we just out Dell?\n\n417\n00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,056\nAre they doing\nan unencrypted sign-in page?\n\n418\n00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:42,030\n>> Yeah, yeah, we did,\ncouldn't supply ownership information.\n\n419\n00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:46,080\nSo maybe Firefox is looking for\na little more information than what that\n\n420\n00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,560\ncertificate is providing, but everything\nelse is still good, as far as the name.\n\n421\n00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,510\n>> Oh, actually, this one is vulnerable.\n\n422\n00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:55,270\nThere's actually some well known SSL\nattacks that are out there right now where\n\n423\n00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:59,470\nsome sites are allowing weaker encryption,\nand it looks like Dell is one of those.\n\n424\n00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,150\nSee at the bottom there,\ntechnical details, broken encryption, and\n\n425\n00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,970\nit's laying out all these\ndifferent protocols.\n\n426\n00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:08,190\nWell it means that Dell, you actually\ncan have an encrypted session with them.\n\n427\n00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,850\nBut they're supporting\nsome weaker protocols also\n\n428\n00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,190\nwhich have been compromised, and\nso sites need to mop that up.\n\n429\n00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,950\nSomeone needs to tell them\nthey need to get on that.\n\n430\n00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,565\n>> They really do.\nI'm sorry for calling you guys out on that\n\n431\n00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:22,630\nbut see, it says either they're not\nencrypted or it's not strong enough.\n\n432\n00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,160\nAnd since I had the HTTPS I'm gonna\nassume that it is being encrypted, but\n\n433\n00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,910\nit's using an older algorithm that\nthere are some vulnerabilities to.\n\n434\n00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,900\nAnd they need to update their\ncertificate and their protocols there.\n\n435\n00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,410\n>> You know, we should also mention\nthe revocation list, just briefly.\n\n436\n00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,520\nWhen you use a certificate like this\nit's actually made up of two pieces.\n\n437\n00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,980\nThere's a private key and a public key.\n\n438\n00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,310\nThe public key is what's being given to\nus that allows us to encrypt data and\n\n439\n00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,750\nsend it to the server, but\n\n440\n00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:52,250\nthe server has this private key,\nand it is super, super sensitive.\n\n441\n00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,390\nIf somebody gets ahold\nof that private key,\n\n442\n00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,360\nthey can decrypt everything that we send.\n\n443\n00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,900\nThey can masquerade as that server.\n\n444\n00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,790\nThat's a real problem.\n\n445\n00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:02,250\nSo hopefully companies like Dell or\n\n446\n00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,610\neven us at ITProTV,\nwe keep our private key private.\n\n447\n00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:09,150\nWe keep it secured, we make sure it\ndoesn't get out, but it's possible that\n\n448\n00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:13,180\na hacker could break into a system and\ncompromise that private key.\n\n449\n00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,250\nThey could get ahold of it,\nso what happens then?\n\n450\n00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,600\n>> At this point we've got to contact\nwho we got that certificate from and\n\n451\n00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,680\nlet them know that that private\nkey has been compromised.\n\n452\n00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,730\nAnd what they're going to do is they're\ngoing to add that certificate they issued\n\n453\n00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,155\nto us, they're going to add it to a list,\nand as Don said,\n\n454\n00:23:28,155 --> 00:23:31,155\nthat list is known as a revocation list.\n\n455\n00:23:31,155 --> 00:23:35,005\nEvery time your computer gets presented\na certificate, when you connect to Dell or\n\n456\n00:23:35,005 --> 00:23:38,135\nBank of America or whomever,\nit does those checks, right.\n\n457\n00:23:38,135 --> 00:23:42,601\nIt checks to make sure the name matches\nthe URL, that it was issued by somebody\n\n458\n00:23:42,601 --> 00:23:45,846\nthat we trust,\nthat the certificate hasn't expired.\n\n459\n00:23:45,846 --> 00:23:49,907\nIt also has to check and see whether or\nnot that certificate has been revoked.\n\n460\n00:23:49,907 --> 00:23:53,317\nAnd, so, if ours had been revoked\nwe would contact our CO or\n\n461\n00:23:53,317 --> 00:23:55,307\nwhoever issue that certificate.\n\n462\n00:23:55,307 --> 00:23:58,548\nThey would add our certificate to\nthe revoked certificates list.\n\n463\n00:23:58,548 --> 00:24:01,093\nAnd then if you tried to\nconnect to our site, or\n\n464\n00:24:01,093 --> 00:24:03,641\na bad guy that was impersonating our site,\nand\n\n465\n00:24:03,641 --> 00:24:08,278\nthey try to present you our certificate,\nyour computer is going to check with them,\n\n466\n00:24:08,278 --> 00:24:13,890\nDigiCert or whomever, it's gonna say, wait\na second, that certificate's been revoked.\n\n467\n00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,710\nAnd it's again going to do the same thing,\n\n468\n00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,320\npop up that warning and\ntell you not to connect to the site.\n\n469\n00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,130\nIt's kind of like, an easy example would\nbe a driver's license here in the US.\n\n470\n00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:28,410\nWhen we have a driver's license issued\nto us by, say, the State of Florida.\n\n471\n00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,410\nIf I don't pay my tickets or\nI get in trouble,\n\n472\n00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,730\nI can have that license suspended.\n\n473\n00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:36,110\nBut they don't come to my house and\ncut up the driver's license, right?\n\n474\n00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,690\nI still have it in my hand, and\n\n475\n00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:41,440\nI could still present it to a police\nofficer if I got pulled over.\n\n476\n00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,710\nHow does he know my driver's\nlicense has been suspended?\n\n477\n00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,591\nBecause the state of\nFlorida keeps a database.\n\n478\n00:24:46,591 --> 00:24:49,207\nAnd when they suspend my license,\nthey add it to the database and\n\n479\n00:24:49,207 --> 00:24:50,460\nhe checks the database.\n\n480\n00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,510\nHe comes up to my car says,\ngive me your license and registration.\n\n481\n00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,510\nI hand it to him.\n\n482\n00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,800\nHe pulls it up in his computer to\nmake sure it's not on that list.\n\n483\n00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,540\nIt's the same thing that's\nhappening with certificates.\n\n484\n00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,930\nWhen you connect to Bank of America,\nit's saying, hey,\n\n485\n00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:04,790\nhere's my certificate and\nit says it's Bank of America.\n\n486\n00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,930\nIt's issued by Digicert, so I trust it.\n\n487\n00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:09,560\nIt's still valid, it has an expired yet.\n\n488\n00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,950\nBut what if it had been revoked.\n\n489\n00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,640\nSo my computer has to\ncheck that list as well\n\n490\n00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,180\nto make sure that that certificate\nhas not been added to that list.\n\n491\n00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,380\n>> And that's all part of what's\nhappening in the background.\n\n492\n00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,600\nEvery time your web browser\ngoes to a secure page,\n\n493\n00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,450\nall of that happens in the background,\nright?\n\n494\n00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:29,280\nIt checks the domain name you browse to,\nwho issued the certificate,\n\n495\n00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,150\nwhen the certificate expires,\nchecks the revocation list.\n\n496\n00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,570\nThat's a lot of stuff.\n\n497\n00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,580\nAll invisible to you, the end user.\n\n498\n00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,110\nRight.\n\n499\n00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,990\nSo all we need to remember as an end\nuser is to look for that lock.\n\n500\n00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,670\nLook for, at least,\nthe little lock up there.\n\n501\n00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,230\nYou want to always get the green bar but\n\n502\n00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,010\nthe green bar lets you know you\ncan extra trust that site, right?\n\n503\n00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:50,670\nIt's got the extended validation,\nso that's good for us.\n\n504\n00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:54,050\nThe regular lock that was enough in\nmost cases to show that encryption.\n\n505\n00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:58,830\nBut be aware of the errors you can spot\nand know that your connection is at risk,\n\n506\n00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,250\nand that you don't want to continue\npassing information across.\n\n507\n00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,675\n>> Yeah, and\nat that point your data could be viewed.\n\n508\n00:26:02,675 --> 00:26:04,275\nBy somebody that you don't want to see.\n\n509\n00:26:05,795 --> 00:26:07,205\n>> Absolutely.\n\n510\n00:26:07,205 --> 00:26:09,885\nOh, Mike I think there's\na pretty good overview of SSL,\n\n511\n00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:11,715\nyou have anything else\nyou are mentioning there?\n\n512\n00:26:11,715 --> 00:26:14,225\n>> I can't think of anything\nelse other than thanking SSL for\n\n513\n00:26:14,225 --> 00:26:17,017\nallowing my online banking so\nI don't have the mail my bills anymore.\n\n514\n00:26:17,017 --> 00:26:19,470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And nobody likes writing checks.\n\n515\n00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,590\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n516\n00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,720\nI hope you guys enjoyed the

episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,120\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\nback again with Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,840\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n6\n00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,760\n>> Fantastic, Don.\n\n7\n00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,430\nExcited for another episode\nof our Security Fundamentals.\n\n8\n00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,060\nAnd today we're gonna be talking\nabout our reconnaissance attacks.\n\n9\n00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,140\nAnd reconnaissance attacks,\n\n10\n00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,530\nthese are kinds of attacks where the bad\nguys are doing reconnaissance, right?\n\n11\n00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:36,460\nThey're going to be doing things like\nscanning your system or scanning a machine\n\n12\n00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,460\nlooking for vulnerabilities, looking for\nways that they can attack or\n\n13\n00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,660\ninfect or do some other malicious\nactivity on your machine.\n\n14\n00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,400\nAnd, Don, this is a type of attack\nthat occurs all the time, right?\n\n15\n00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,360\n>> Yeah, if you were to take a computer\nand plug it directly into the Internet,\n\n16\n00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,800\nlike you take a cable modem or DSL and\nplug it right in the back of the computer\n\n17\n00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,420\nand run like a traffic monitor,\nyou'll see that your computer gets scanned\n\n18\n00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,570\nnot just like once a day or\nonce an hour, even once a minute.\n\n19\n00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:13,020\nYour computer's getting scanned thousands\nupon thousands of times per hour just all\n\n20\n00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,050\nthroughout the day and that's because this\nis really the first stage of an attack.\n\n21\n00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,290\nWhen somebody's going to break into a\nnetwork, they don't just jump right in and\n\n22\n00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,380\nstart breaking in.\n\n23\n00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,670\nThey do reconnaissance,\nthey learn about the network.\n\n24\n00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,340\nAnd there's automated tools that\nare running that are constantly scanning\n\n25\n00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,440\nthe Internet and\nthat puts your systems at risk.\n\n26\n00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,260\nThat's why it's important to understand\nwhat this type of attack is and\n\n27\n00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,510\nwhat we can do to prevent it.\n\n28\n00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,090\n>> Exactly, so when we talk about scanning\nyour system, what do we mean by that?\n\n29\n00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,180\nWell, we look at the way a computer works\nand the way it sends and receives data.\n\n30\n00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,370\nIt creates what we call a socket.\n\n31\n00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,860\nAnd your computer has 65 thousand plus\n\n32\n00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,620\nports that it can use to\nestablish these sockets.\n\n33\n00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,571\nSo you can think about it,\nit's just different connection points.\n\n34\n00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,410\nYour computer can have all these\ndifferent connections going on for\n\n35\n00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,970\ndifferent protocols and\ndifferent services.\n\n36\n00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:04,000\nThere are some of these ports that are\nassigned particular protocols or services.\n\n37\n00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,910\nSome of them are dynamic and\ncan be used by anything.\n\n38\n00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,760\nBut for us, what it means is,\nthe bad guy's scanning all those ports.\n\n39\n00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,370\nAnd from the information that he gathers,\nlooking at those and\n\n40\n00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,990\ndetermining whether or not the port\nis open, meaning that it's listening,\n\n41\n00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,940\nthat it's waiting for\nanother machine machine to connect to and\n\n42\n00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,880\nif somebody tries to connect to that\nparticular port number, it'll allow it.\n\n43\n00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,760\nOr whether that port is closed,\nmeaning that that machine, your machine is\n\n44\n00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,410\nnot going to accept any connections\non that particular port number.\n\n45\n00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,910\nRemember, I said there's\n65,535 of these guys.\n\n46\n00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,000\nSo we run things like firewalls.\n\n47\n00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,680\nWe talked about that in another episode.\n\n48\n00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,410\nIf you've missed it, go check it out.\n\n49\n00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,760\nAnd our firewalls typically\nblock all these ports, and\n\n50\n00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,850\nthen we can pick and choose which\nones we allow, which ones we open up.\n\n51\n00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,550\nBut to run certain services,\n\n52\n00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,080\nto run certain applications,\nwe've got to open some of these.\n\n53\n00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,485\nAnd what the bad guy does is he scans,\nlooks for which ones are open and\n\n54\n00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:03,385\nfrom that information he can\nstart to determine things like\n\n55\n00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:07,725\nwhat applications you're running, what\nservices might be running on your machine,\n\n56\n00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:10,685\nmaybe even what operating\nsystem you're running.\n\n57\n00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:14,390\nSo there's a lot of information they\ncan gain from running these scans.\n\n58\n00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,220\n>> Yeah, and it's one of those things\nwhere it's like the double edged sword of\n\n59\n00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,900\nhow powerful a computer is.\n\n60\n00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,880\nIf we were to put it in human terms,\n\n61\n00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,010\nif I want to exchange information\nwith Mike, I just talk.\n\n62\n00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:25,790\nHe's standing right next to me.\n\n63\n00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,437\nHe's gonna hear me, right?\n\n64\n00:03:26,437 --> 00:03:27,525\nSo hey, Mike, how you doing?\n\n65\n00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:28,218\n>> Unless I ignore him.\n\n66\n00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:31,507\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Well, it'd be kind of like a firewall,\n\n67\n00:03:31,507 --> 00:03:32,303\nright, reject it.\n\n68\n00:03:32,303 --> 00:03:34,277\nSo you just have a conversation, but\n\n69\n00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:38,620\nimagine if there were five people\nhere all talking to Mike at once.\n\n70\n00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,359\nIt just all blends together,\nand he can't properly answer,\n\n71\n00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:43,220\nthere's too much going on at once.\n\n72\n00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,070\nWell, computers are great multitaskers.\n\n73\n00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,345\nThey can do any number of things at once.\n\n74\n00:03:48,345 --> 00:03:50,535\nAnd so all they do is, they say, okay,\n\n75\n00:03:50,535 --> 00:03:52,625\nI've got five people\ntalking to me at once.\n\n76\n00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,695\nI'm gonna assign each one a number, right.\n\n77\n00:03:54,695 --> 00:03:57,525\nAnd I'm gonna assign each one\nto these different ports.\n\n78\n00:03:57,525 --> 00:04:00,165\nAnd when they talk to me, they'll have\nthese port numbers associated, and\n\n79\n00:04:00,165 --> 00:04:04,075\nthat's how I can tell them apart and I can\nrespond to them and keep it all straight.\n\n80\n00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:08,565\nBut attackers can take advantage of that\nby recognizing what are called well-known\n\n81\n00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:09,085\nport numbers.\n\n82\n00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:12,710\nNow, Mike, you mentioned,\nthere's 65,000 ports.\n\n83\n00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,310\nI know a lot of those are randomly\nchosen at conversation time,\n\n84\n00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,750\nbut not all of them are, right?\n\n85\n00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,500\n>> Exactly,\na lot of them are what we know, or\n\n86\n00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,660\nactually the first 1,024\nare known as our well-known ports.\n\n87\n00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,300\nAnd these are ports that\nhave been registered for\n\n88\n00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,000\nparticular services that are important\nthat all these machines use.\n\n89\n00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,040\nThese vendors can get a port assigned\nto them by the IA, NA or ICANN.\n\n90\n00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,700\nFor example, web traffic,\n\n91\n00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,810\nall web traffic by default is\ngonna flow across port number 80.\n\n92\n00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,290\nSo if I scan a machine, and I see that\nport 80 is open and listening and\n\n93\n00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,410\nwaiting for connections, there's a really\ngood chance that that machine is a web\n\n94\n00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:50,180\nserver that is providing web services.\n\n95\n00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,930\nAnd you think, well, okay, big deal.\n\n96\n00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,130\nWhat is that going to do for the bad guy?\n\n97\n00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,000\nWell, now I know it's a web server and\nI can start to look at\n\n98\n00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,310\ndifferent types of attacks that\nfocus on those web server services.\n\n99\n00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,670\nI know what you might be vulnerable to.\n\n100\n00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,950\nIf I scan your machine and\nI see that port 3389 is open, for example,\n\n101\n00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:13,310\nthat's a port number that's been assigned\nto Remote Desktop in a Microsoft world.\n\n102\n00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,590\nSo that tells me a couple things.\n\n103\n00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,150\nOne, that you're accepting\nRemote Desktop requests and\n\n104\n00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,070\nyou're probably running\na Microsoft operating system.\n\n105\n00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,240\nSo these are the kind of the things\nthat the bad guys are doing.\n\n106\n00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,352\nThey're scanning machines, looking at\nthese and trying to figure out what they\n\n107\n00:05:27,352 --> 00:05:31,414\ncan do, what types of attacks are going\nto be successful against your machine.\n\n108\n00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,604\n>> Yeah, if they just try to start\ndoing attacks right off the bat,\n\n109\n00:05:34,604 --> 00:05:37,571\nthey might be throwing Windows\nattacks on a Linux machine.\n\n110\n00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,135\nAnd they're not going to work,\nit's a waste of time.\n\n111\n00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:42,485\nThey wanna be efficient with their time,\nthey want to compromise as much as they\n\n112\n00:05:42,485 --> 00:05:44,750\ncan, so\nthey're gonna be a lot more focused.\n\n113\n00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,710\nAnd the other thing is a lot of people\nwill run services and not realize it.\n\n114\n00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,360\nMaybe you just installed some random\nsoftware on your computer that brought up\n\n115\n00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,290\na web server, and now you're listening\non port 80, but you never realize that.\n\n116\n00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,140\nAnd an attacker scans the network,\nthey see this web server that you\n\n117\n00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,740\ndon't necessarily even remember you have,\nand they start to exploit it.\n\n118\n00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,740\nThese are the risks that we have when\nwe install third party software on\n\n119\n00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,310\nour machines.\n\n120\n00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,670\nWe really need to know\nwhat that software does.\n\n121\n00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,670\nSo there's ways that we can\nsafeguard against that,\n\n122\n00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:16,160\nthat we can close off these ports and one\nof the best ways is a firewall like you\n\n123\n00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,710\ntalk about in the other episode,\nright Mike?\n\n124\n00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,550\n>> Exactly, and if you enable a firewall,\nnow that's gonna close all those ports and\n\n125\n00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,800\nthen just open up the ones you're using.\n\n126\n00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,930\nNow those ports are still open.\n\n127\n00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,525\nIf you are running a web server,\nyou have to open up port 80.\n\n128\n00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:30,605\nThat port's still going to\naccept connections, but\n\n129\n00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:33,865\nat least all 65,000 of\nthose ports aren't open.\n\n130\n00:06:33,865 --> 00:06:36,765\nSo you're making it a little\nmore difficult for the bad guy.\n\n131\n00:06:36,765 --> 00:06:37,705\nIt's also a good idea.\n\n132\n00:06:37,705 --> 00:06:41,025\nI'm going to show you in a minute here\na tool that you can use that the bad guys\n\n133\n00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:45,030\nuse, but as sysadmins or\njust as an end user, you can use as well\n\n134\n00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,680\nto scan your own machines on your\nnetwork and find out what's listening.\n\n135\n00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,810\nCuz as Don said, you might have installed\nsomething that opened up a couple of\n\n136\n00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,350\nports, and you didn't know it.\n\n137\n00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,710\nAnd those aren't necessary and you want to\nclose them, but If you didn't know they\n\n138\n00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,820\nwere open, then you wouldn't know\nto go to look and close them.\n\n139\n00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,220\nSo by running these tools,\nwe can find out what ports are open.\n\n140\n00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,860\nWe can see what the bad guys are seeing\nand maybe we can do something about it.\n\n141\n00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,510\nWe go into our firewall and\n\n142\n00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,400\nwe decide to remove that exception\nthat one of those programs made.\n\n143\n00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,690\nOr we decide that we don't\nuse Remote Desktop, so\n\n144\n00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,050\nwe're going to block that particular port.\n\n145\n00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,000\nSo by scanning your machine with one of\nthese tools, you can see what the bad guys\n\n146\n00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,610\nare seeing and maybe do something\nabout it before they find it, right?\n\n147\n00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,480\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and\n\n148\n00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,560\nthese tools, like we talk about the tools\nattackers use, they're not hard to use.\n\n149\n00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,100\nMost of them are pretty easy to use.\n\n150\n00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,580\nAnybody with a few minutes of time\non Google can find these tools,\n\n151\n00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,880\nfind how to use them, and\nstart to scan a network.\n\n152\n00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,050\nNow what you do after\nthat's kind of up to you,\n\n153\n00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,880\nbut network scans are, they're a force for\nevil and they're a force for good.\n\n154\n00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,720\nWe can use them to scan our own network\nto locate systems that might be weak.\n\n155\n00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,391\nSo, having a basic knowledge of\nthese tools is pretty handy.\n\n156\n00:07:51,391 --> 00:07:54,822\nFor our fundamental show we don't\nnecessarily sweat that too much but\n\n157\n00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:56,751\nit is great to be able to jump in and see.\n\n158\n00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:58,211\nExactly how one of these works.\n\n159\n00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,351\nWhat the attacker is going to have.\n\n160\n00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:00,951\n>> Exactly.\n\n161\n00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:02,970\nSo let's take a look at my screen here.\n\n162\n00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,820\nAnd what I've got is\na program called Nmap.\n\n163\n00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,800\nAnd it's a very common scanning utility.\n\n164\n00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,870\nIt's one of the most popular ones.\n\n165\n00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:15,500\nAnd this particular one is Zenmap\nwhich is their Windows GUI version.\n\n166\n00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,130\nNormally this type of tool is gonna be run\nfrom that black and white command prompt.\n\n167\n00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,010\nFor the show I wanted to kind\nof show you a little more, so\n\n168\n00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,780\nI've got the GUI version\nwhere I can click on things.\n\n169\n00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,060\nAnd we could just see\nthe results in a pretty format.\n\n170\n00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,230\nNow I've already run a scan against my\nown machine from a virtual machine.\n\n171\n00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,320\nBecause the scan, if I do,\n\n172\n00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,450\nand you can, there's different\ntypes of scans you can do.\n\n173\n00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,960\nDo I want to scan all 65,535 ports?\n\n174\n00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,020\nMaybe I do.\n\n175\n00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,250\nBut if I've got a particular\nattack in mind, or\n\n176\n00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,120\nif I'm just trying to scan my system,\nmaybe I just want to scan the most\n\n177\n00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,810\ncommon ports, just to see what services\nare running so you can limit it.\n\n178\n00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,470\nI went ahead and ran what they call\nan intense scan on my machine here,\n\n179\n00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,160\nwhich doesn't try to be stealthy at all.\n\n180\n00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,070\nIf I was a bad guy, they might slow\nthese attacks down or these scans down.\n\n181\n00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,640\nBut this still took quite\na few minutes to run.\n\n182\n00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,240\nSo I got that run ahead of time, and\nwe're just now looking at the results.\n\n183\n00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,080\nAll I did with this tool, though,\nthe icon here on my desktop,\n\n184\n00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,990\nI installed it a little bit ago.\n\n185\n00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,930\nAnd once I open it up,\n\n186\n00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,320\nI typed in the IP address of\nthe machine that I wanted to scan.\n\n187\n00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,690\nYou can use the IP address or\nyou can use the name of the computer,\n\n188\n00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,040\ndepending on how your network is set up.\n\n189\n00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,660\nAnd then over here, I've got\nthe types of scans that I can run.\n\n190\n00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,340\nAnd I clicked Scan.\n\n191\n00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,470\nAnd like I said,\nit took a few minutes to run.\n\n192\n00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,430\nAnd here's my results.\n\n193\n00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:38,750\nAs I scroll down here, I start seeing\nthings like discovered open ports.\n\n194\n00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,360\nSo these are port numbers that my\nmachine is currently listening on.\n\n195\n00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,200\nSo for example, 135, which I wanna say it\nNetBIOS of TCP IP if I remember correctly.\n\n196\n00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,760\nThere's a bunch of the dynamic\nports in there, but\n\n197\n00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,010\nI've got quite a few ports opened up here.\n\n198\n00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,020\nAnd as we scroll down below this,\n\n199\n00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:04,050\neven more than the open ports it also\ntried to do some OS detection, right?\n\n200\n00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,260\nWhich means it's trying to figure out\nwhat operating system I'm running.\n\n201\n00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,437\nNow as I click through these other tabs,\nhere's an actual screen shot again,\n\n202\n00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:16,102\nthose are the ports that I have opened up,\nso there's that 139 which is my Net BIOS.\n\n203\n00:10:16,102 --> 00:10:18,900\nI can go over here to host details, and\n\n204\n00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,180\nI can see that it's tried to guess\nwhat operating system I have.\n\n205\n00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:27,490\nThis one says 2008 R2,\nwhich this is really running Windows 8.1.\n\n206\n00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,580\nBut it's the same base kernel there,\nso it's going to.\n\n207\n00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,520\nSometimes it's difficult for\nit to detect the exact operating system.\n\n208\n00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,340\nWhat it's doing is it's\nlooking at the responses.\n\n209\n00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,580\nDifferent operating systems respond\ndifferently if the port is closed.\n\n210\n00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,490\nAnd so when it does the scan it\nlooks at those responses and\n\n211\n00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,570\nit tries to make a best guess.\n\n212\n00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,680\nAnd in this case, at least I can\nsee that it's running Windows.\n\n213\n00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,980\nIn fact, if I look at the detailed\nreport back over here, I can scroll\n\n214\n00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,610\ndown just a little bit, and you'll see\nthe OS, it's detecting it as 2008 R2, or\n\n215\n00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:07,580\nWindows 7, or Windows 8, or Windows CPE,\nor Server, blah, blah, blah, etc., etc.\n\n216\n00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,270\nSo like I said, it's come close\nto figuring out what it wants.\n\n217\n00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,920\nAnd as a bad guy, that's a good step,\nbecause as Don said,\n\n218\n00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,830\nthere's gonna be things that I\ncan do against a Windows machine\n\n219\n00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,660\nthat I couldn't do against\na Linux machine or a Mac machine.\n\n220\n00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,910\nRight?\nSo now the bad guy has an idea of that.\n\n221\n00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,555\nIn the end, There's not a lot I\ncan do about that particular part.\n\n222\n00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:31,875\nBut it is useful to see\nwhat ports are open and\n\n223\n00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:33,770\nto see what services\nare running on this machine.\n\n224\n00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,265\nBecause maybe I see something on there,\nlike Don said earlier,\n\n225\n00:11:36,265 --> 00:11:38,165\nmaybe I see a web service running.\n\n226\n00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,675\nAnd I go, I'm not running\na web server on this machine.\n\n227\n00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:43,465\nAnd then I can go try to figure\nout why that port is open and\n\n228\n00:11:43,465 --> 00:11:45,195\nI can do something about it.\n\n229\n00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:49,330\n>> Yeah, one real vulnerable one that I've\nseen over the years is where people have\n\n230\n00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,260\nnetwork attached printers or\nnetwork attached storage right?\n\n231\n00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,990\nThose little NAS hard drive boxes.\n\n232\n00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,990\nAnd those will typically run\na web server of some sort.\n\n233\n00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,820\nAnd it's usually an open\nsource web server like Apache.\n\n234\n00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,250\nAnd because it's hardware, the\nmanufacturer put a particular version of\n\n235\n00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,950\nthat software on there and\nit hasn't been updated since, right?\n\n236\n00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,830\nIf I ask you the viewer to think about it,\nif you've got a printer near you.\n\n237\n00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,070\nWhen's the last time you updated\nthe firmware on your printer?\n\n238\n00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,590\n>> Never?\n\n239\n00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,770\n>> Most people would say never.\n\n240\n00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,550\nIn fact some printers, they do\nupdated drivers for the desktop but\n\n241\n00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,070\nthey never release firmware for\nthe printer.\n\n242\n00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,790\nSame thing goes for\nthat network attached storage.\n\n243\n00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,500\nA lot of times they don't\npush out firmware or\n\n244\n00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,380\nif they do you just\ndon't find out about it.\n\n245\n00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,880\nSo what happens is over time\nvulnerabilities are detected in that\n\n246\n00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,390\nsoftware.\n\n247\n00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,860\nThat version of Linux or\nweb browser running on it.\n\n248\n00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,190\nThat makes it easy to fingerprint\nwhat system that is and\n\n249\n00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,400\nmakes it easy to have\ncertain exploits available.\n\n250\n00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,920\nSo when they scan the network,\nthey can see that that\n\n251\n00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,410\nbox is not only running Linux, but\na very particular version of Linux.\n\n252\n00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:52,710\nAnd that keys them into\nattacks that are available.\n\n253\n00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:56,382\nOr one of my favorites is let's\nsay I scan a machine, and\n\n254\n00:12:56,382 --> 00:13:00,855\nI scan a machine and\nI see that it's running Linux Kernel 3.12.\n\n255\n00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:02,068\nAll right?\nAnd I say, okay,\n\n256\n00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:04,350\nI know they're running Linux Kernel 3.12.\n\n257\n00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:09,690\nLet me go find Linux Kernel 3.13 and\nlook at the release notes.\n\n258\n00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,320\nIn the release notes for the next version\nit'll list all the things they fixed.\n\n259\n00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,960\nThat's all stuff I know is broken in 3.12.\n\n260\n00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,005\nAnd now they've practically given me the\nexploits to use to get into that system.\n\n261\n00:13:20,005 --> 00:13:23,240\nThen it's as simple as going and reading\nthe release notes that are out there.\n\n262\n00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,430\nSame thing goes for firmware.\n\n263\n00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,250\nIf you scan somebody's router or\nprinter or whatever and\n\n264\n00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,180\nyou see they're at\na certain firmware version,\n\n265\n00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,380\nyou just gotta pull the release notes for\nthe next one and there's your exploit.\n\n266\n00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,730\nOr maybe you don't even bother with that.\n\n267\n00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,930\nYou just look at the MAC address.\n\n268\n00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:41,300\nNow Mike, did your Nmap Scan\nshow where a MAC address,\n\n269\n00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,620\na Media Access Control address for\na computer.\n\n270\n00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,320\nIt's made up of a 48-bit\nhexadecimal number.\n\n271\n00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,510\nAnd it's basically, what is it,\nlike 12 letters and numbers all combined?\n\n272\n00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,970\n>> Separated by colons, typically, yep.\n\n273\n00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,560\n>> The first six are what's called an OID,\nand\n\n274\n00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,140\nthey identify who\nmanufactured that equipment.\n\n275\n00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,250\nAnd so Nmap will translate that.\n\n276\n00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,250\nYeah, Mike's did it.\n\n277\n00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,390\nSo you can see where his\nfirst six are there, and\n\n278\n00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:09,260\nthen it translated that to\nGood Way Industries or something.\n\n279\n00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,420\nSo I can go and\n\n280\n00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,730\nsay, all right, who is this Good Way\ncompany that makes network adapters?\n\n281\n00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,560\nAnd then we can start to figure\nout who made that network adapter.\n\n282\n00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,160\nAnd then once I know that,\nnow I can say, all right,\n\n283\n00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,020\nwell, let me just go check the latest\nrelease notes for any firmware for it.\n\n284\n00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,740\nAnd I'm going to bank on the fact that\nMike hasn't updated and let me try and\n\n285\n00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,603\nexploit these things.\n\n286\n00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:30,780\nAnd maybe they fail and\nI just move on to the next person, or\n\n287\n00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,650\nmaybe they succeed and I'm in.\n\n288\n00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:36,300\nThat's the way an attacker can figure\nout what way to get in your system and\n\n289\n00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,830\nthat's why they call this reconnaissance.\n\n290\n00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,711\nMike's not actually breaking into\nthat computer, he's just scanning,\n\n291\n00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:42,840\nhe's looking at it.\n\n292\n00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,430\nRight?\n\n293\n00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,910\nAnd if you're at that computer,\nyou don't even notice that happens.\n\n294\n00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:50,620\nThis is all done without really setting\nup any red flags in your computer.\n\n295\n00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,490\nThat's what makes this stuff so\nchallenging.\n\n296\n00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,570\n>> It is, yeah.\n\n297\n00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,480\nAnd I'll show you another example here.\n\n298\n00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,730\nIf I, I'm gonna go to my\nmachine that I was scanning.\n\n299\n00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,590\nI'm gonna turn on my Remote Desktop.\n\n300\n00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,180\nI'm gonna come in here and\nallow remote desktop, click OK, and\n\n301\n00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,050\nif I flip back over to\nthe VM I'm gonna run a new scan.\n\n302\n00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,500\nNow this time I'm going to\ndo a little quick scan.\n\n303\n00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,700\nWe don't need all the OS\ndetection at this point.\n\n304\n00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,550\nI'll run a quick scan,\nshouldn't take too long.\n\n305\n00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,640\nAnd let's see if we've got\na difference in the results.\n\n306\n00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:27,140\nAnd immediately I can see I have a new\nport open that was not open before,\n\n307\n00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,190\nright there.\n\n308\n00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:33,540\nThat is my Remote Desktop,\nlisted as ms-wbt-server.\n\n309\n00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,570\nBut that's the port number that\nRemote Desktop connects on by default.\n\n310\n00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,362\nSo those are the kind of\nthings that I can try to find.\n\n311\n00:15:39,362 --> 00:15:43,318\nIf I see something that's open\nlike this and I wasn't using it,\n\n312\n00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:47,584\nnow I can go back to my firewall and\ngo, okay, let's get rid of that.\n\n313\n00:15:47,584 --> 00:15:50,844\nI'm not using Remote Desktop, so maybe I\nwant to come back over to this machine.\n\n314\n00:15:50,844 --> 00:15:55,724\nOpen up my firewall and\nfigure out why that port's open.\n\n315\n00:15:55,724 --> 00:16:00,700\nAll right, so I can take a look\nat what is going on here.\n\n316\n00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,680\nAnd I can see, I should be able to,\n\n317\n00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,860\nthat remote desktop sure\nenough has been enabled.\n\n318\n00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,395\nI come in here and I change my settings,\n\n319\n00:16:07,395 --> 00:16:10,860\nand maybe I just do away\nwith Remote Desktop.\n\n320\n00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,816\nAnd I click Okay and I could have done\nthat through the other options or\n\n321\n00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:15,390\nI could have just turned\nRemote Desktop off,\n\n322\n00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,040\nbut I wanted to show you what it\nlooks like in the firewall there.\n\n323\n00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,050\n>> And the way you're showing it, Remote\nDesktop is still technically enabled and\n\n324\n00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,780\nrunning, we're just\nblocking in on the network.\n\n325\n00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,680\n>> Exactly.\n\n326\n00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,405\nSo now if I flip back over here and\nI run that scan again, and\n\n327\n00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:33,501\nwe'll do another little quick scan.\n\n328\n00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:34,760\n>> And it should turn up this time.\n\n329\n00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,444\nWell, it will turn up\nthe other ports right?\n\n330\n00:16:36,444 --> 00:16:37,050\n>> Yep.\n>> And\n\n331\n00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,249\nthen 3389 should be left off that list.\n\n332\n00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,702\n>> 33 89 is left off.\n\n333\n00:16:40,702 --> 00:16:43,848\nAnd if you remember from the other\nepisode, when we were talking about\n\n334\n00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:47,810\nfirewalls, remember, I can do that on\na per profile basis on a Windows machine.\n\n335\n00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:52,020\nMaybe I want to allow Remote Desktop when\nI'm connected to my work network because\n\n336\n00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,650\nthat's what the help desk uses to fix\nmy computer when I'm having problems.\n\n337\n00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,895\nBut when I'm out at Starbucks, I I don't\nwant anybody trying to remote into my\n\n338\n00:16:58,895 --> 00:17:01,695\nmachine, so\nI wanna block that on that public network.\n\n339\n00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,875\nRemember, we have those\ntwo columns of checkmarks.\n\n340\n00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,934\nSo, maybe it's been turned on and\nI go in there and I go oh,\n\n341\n00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:09,375\nI don't want to turn it\non the public network.\n\n342\n00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:13,315\nI can uncheck it just public and\nleave it turned on on the private network.\n\n343\n00:17:13,315 --> 00:17:15,365\nSo, we can control when\nthose ports are open.\n\n344\n00:17:15,365 --> 00:17:19,025\nAnd that's one of the things we can\ndo using these same tools the bad\n\n345\n00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:22,060\nguys are doing with their\nreconnaissance scans.\n\n346\n00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,310\n>> Now, Mike, up until this point,\n\n347\n00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,350\nyou've been showing us\na targeted reconnaissance scan.\n\n348\n00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,110\nYou've been focused on this one host.\n\n349\n00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,650\nSo, an attacker is looking\nat this machine and saying,\n\n350\n00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,785\nhow am I gonna get into this machine?\n\n351\n00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:36,955\nBut when an attacker first comes to a new\nnetwork, they've never touched that\n\n352\n00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,345\nnetwork before, they might not\nknow a single host on the network.\n\n353\n00:17:39,345 --> 00:17:42,685\nThey usually start a little more general,\nwith something like a ping sweep, right?\n\n354\n00:17:42,685 --> 00:17:43,395\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n355\n00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,510\nThey're gonna come in and try to find out.\n\n356\n00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,410\nFirst they have to figure out what\nyour IP address range is typically on\n\n357\n00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,390\nyour network.\n\n358\n00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,060\nAnd then once they've got that they'll\nscan the entire network looking for\n\n359\n00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,200\nlive hosts.\n\n360\n00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,010\nI happen to know the IP address of\nthe machine I was scanning there for\n\n361\n00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:57,970\nthis demo.\n\n362\n00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,620\nBut as a bad guy,\nI might not know your IP address.\n\n363\n00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:06,690\nAnd if you've got a typical, even a small\nsubnet with a normal class C subnet,\n\n364\n00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,400\nyou have 254 possible hosts on there.\n\n365\n00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,780\nI don't want to waste my time\nscanning a bunch of IP addresses that\n\n366\n00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,870\ndon't actually have\na host attached to them.\n\n367\n00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:19,180\nSo, they can do these pings sweeps, and\njust see what IP addresses even respond.\n\n368\n00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,480\nAnd then they can fine tune\ntheir scan from there.\n\n369\n00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,580\n>> Mike,\ncan you show us a quick ping sweep.\n\n370\n00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,150\nMaybe we'll just do a quick\nscan of the ITProTV network.\n\n371\n00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,510\n>> All right,\nlet's see if we can change this.\n\n372\n00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,180\n>> What Mike's gonna do is he's gonna\nchange us from being focused at\n\n373\n00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,840\na single host to being\nfocused at the network.\n\n374\n00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,325\nI know Mike mentioned,\nwe gotta figure out what the IP range is.\n\n375\n00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:43,240\nWell, most networks run DHCP,\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol.\n\n376\n00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,730\nAnd that means when you\nplug your computer in,\n\n377\n00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,040\nyou automatically get\nan address from the network.\n\n378\n00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,040\nThe network's already telling\nyou what address you have.\n\n379\n00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,960\nBut even if you don't, you could\nfire up a utility like Wireshark or\n\n380\n00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,640\nany kind of network sniffer and\njust look at the packets on the network.\n\n381\n00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,040\nYou'll see the IP range right there.\n\n382\n00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,550\nSo that's a trivial thing for\n\n383\n00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,400\nsomebody to find out if they're\nplugged into the network.\n\n384\n00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,540\nAnd then after that, you can come in and\ndo a ping scan like he's doing.\n\n385\n00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:11,590\nAnd it's gonna start from the beginning of\nthat network and just scan all the way up.\n\n386\n00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,070\nAnd, Mike,\nI think it makes you put a /24 in there.\n\n387\n00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,310\n>> It is gonna make me put that on there.\n\n388\n00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:20,665\n>> And that's just the subnet notation\nthat tells it to scan from .1 all the way\n\n389\n00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:22,200\nthrough .254.\n\n390\n00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,870\nAnd so it's gonna run through and scan.\n\n391\n00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,930\nHe's now sending out pings.\n\n392\n00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,662\nNow, in the network that he\nspecified there's 254 usable IPs.\n\n393\n00:19:29,662 --> 00:19:35,240\nSo, he's gonna send out 254 pings and\nwait to get responses back.\n\n394\n00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,310\nAnd you can see it right\nthere on the screen.\n\n395\n00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:41,090\nIt's popping up there and showing you\nall these machines that are out there.\n\n396\n00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,610\nThese are now targets.\n\n397\n00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,380\nMike can say, look,\n\n398\n00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,730\nthese are computers that are on\nthe network that I could focus on.\n\n399\n00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,690\nIf I want to attack these guys, I could.\n\n400\n00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,380\nHe doesn't necessarily know what they are,\nhe just knows they responded.\n\n401\n00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,450\nAnd I guess maybe you know a little bit,\n\n402\n00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,918\nbecause the MAC addresses are translated,\nright?\n\n403\n00:19:54,918 --> 00:19:57,570\n>> I was gonna say, even from just doing\nthat ping sweep, as you were saying\n\n404\n00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,080\nearlier about the MAC address,\n>> I can see some are unknown.\n\n405\n00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,490\nI see some Intel.\n\n406\n00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,270\nI definitely see some Apple going on.\n\n407\n00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,080\nI've got a Roku machine on our network.\n\n408\n00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,790\nSo, I'm getting a little bit of\ninformation just from doing a ping sweep.\n\n409\n00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,070\nThere's a couple of Black Magics.\n\n410\n00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,050\nThat's our cameras here.\n\n411\n00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,080\nSo, we're seeing all kinds of things.\n\n412\n00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,470\nAnd then I can take one of those addresses\nand I can focus on that and do a scan and\n\n413\n00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,780\nsee what kind of results I'm gonna get.\n\n414\n00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:25,169\nSo, a lot of information can be\ngained using this simple tool.\n\n415\n00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:29,195\nBut for a bad guy,\nthat's a great start to an attack.\n\n416\n00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:31,185\nSo, we have to remember,\n\n417\n00:20:31,185 --> 00:20:33,685\none it's important to see\nwhat the bad guys are saying.\n\n418\n00:20:33,685 --> 00:20:36,775\nWe want to make sure that we're looking\nat our network the way they would so\n\n419\n00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:40,892\nthat we can see what they're seeing and\nthen we can do something about it.\n\n420\n00:20:40,892 --> 00:20:43,832\nAnd try to find it before the bad guys do.\n\n421\n00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:46,052\n>> Yeah.\nSo, it's\n\n422\n00:20:46,052 --> 00:20:47,602\nnot a difficult thing to pull off.\n\n423\n00:20:47,602 --> 00:20:52,400\nIt is where an attacker starts, and\nit's kind of easy to thwart, right?\n\n424\n00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,340\nWays that we can prevent\nthis from happening.\n\n425\n00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,210\nFirewalls, right?\n\n426\n00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,900\nMike showed that, you cut off pretty easy.\n\n427\n00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,500\nPreventing people from being able\nto plug into your network, right?\n\n428\n00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,060\nKeeping them off of your physical or\nwireless networks, that's another way.\n\n429\n00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,425\nAnd other things like\nintrusion detection devices or\n\n430\n00:21:09,425 --> 00:21:11,495\nIDS intrusion detection systems.\n\n431\n00:21:11,495 --> 00:21:15,810\nThey are devices that you can plug in that\nwatch for people doing scans like these.\n\n432\n00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,740\nAnd if they see a scan, they can shut the\nport off that person's plugged into, or\n\n433\n00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,170\nthey can block him on the network to\nstop responses from going to him.\n\n434\n00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,910\nIt protects your system.\n\n435\n00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,700\nThose intrusion detection systems are\npretty sweet, but pretty expensive too.\n\n436\n00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,550\nSo you only see them in medium and\nlarge businesses.\n\n437\n00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:34,120\nFor home, small office, you're not\ngonna see that kind of functionality.\n\n438\n00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,220\nSo, it's up to us to make sure that one,\n\n439\n00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,320\nwe have our software firewalls\nconfigured on our workstations.\n\n440\n00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,560\nAnd two,\nwe don't install third party software\n\n441\n00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,170\nwithout at least a basic understanding\nof what all it's gonna do on our system.\n\n442\n00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,510\nWhat ports that it might open and so on.\n\n443\n00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,320\nAnd if you're curious\nabout your own system.\n\n444\n00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:58,030\nIf I'm looking at my computer and I say,\nboy, what ports am I listening on?\n\n445\n00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,050\nWhat is open on my system?\n\n446\n00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,010\nWell, there's a couple of tools\nthat are available for that.\n\n447\n00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,830\nI think it's, what,\nNetStat-N is a good one.\n\n448\n00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:10,140\nThat are command line utilities\nyou can run that will show you\n\n449\n00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,020\nthe ports that are open on your system,\nbut those tools are a little hard to use.\n\n450\n00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,020\nThe firewall table that Mike went to,\nthat's the easiest way.\n\n451\n00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,370\nYou can see what's allowed right there,\nand you just check to turn them off and\n\n452\n00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,440\nit's knocked out.\n\n453\n00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,920\n>> And we probably should throw in\na little bit of a disclaimer here, Don,\n\n454\n00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,730\nat this point.\n\n455\n00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,770\nWe're talking about using\nthese scanning tools.\n\n456\n00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,560\nAnd one thing you wanna keep in mind,\nif you're on your corporate network,\n\n457\n00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,350\nyou want to make sure it's\nokay to run one of these\n\n458\n00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,340\ntools, cuz you could\ndo a couple of things.\n\n459\n00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,040\nOne, you could set off your own\ncompany's intrusion detection systems.\n\n460\n00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,080\nIf they're running them,\nthey're gonna trace it back to you.\n\n461\n00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,947\nThe thing about these scans is that they\ncan make a little noise if you're not\n\n462\n00:22:47,947 --> 00:22:48,860\ncareful with it.\n\n463\n00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,875\nIn other words,\nthey're sending out a lot of packets.\n\n464\n00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:55,140\nIf you scan all 65,535 ports on a machine.\n\n465\n00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,390\nI mean it does it in a matter\nof a couple of minutes.\n\n466\n00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,020\nThat's a lot of traffic\nhitting that network.\n\n467\n00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,840\nIf you're doing that ping sweep,\nthese intrusion detection systems can see\n\n468\n00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,530\nevery IP address getting\npinged one at a time.\n\n469\n00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,400\nThey can detect that kind of behavior.\n\n470\n00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,790\nThey know it's typically\nsomething malicious.\n\n471\n00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,910\nAnd it will set off an alert,\nand you can get in trouble.\n\n472\n00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:17,000\nIt's most likely in your acceptable use\n\n473\n00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,680\npolicy at work that you're not\nallowed to run tools like these.\n\n474\n00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:25,330\nA lot of your ISPs will also have clauses\nin their EULAs that you've signed and\n\n475\n00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:30,510\nnever read, those things, that say\nyou're not allowed to do ping sweeps.\n\n476\n00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,370\nTechnically, at this point, the law,\n\n477\n00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:37,330\nthere's really nothing illegal about\nit because you're not breaking in.\n\n478\n00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:41,230\nIt's like walking down\na row of a strip mall and\n\n479\n00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,270\npulling out all the front doors\nto see if they're open or not.\n\n480\n00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,880\nWell you're not actually breaking in,\nright?\n\n481\n00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,360\nSo there's really nothing illegal.\n\n482\n00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,800\nBut what were you gonna do if\nyou found an open door, right?\n\n483\n00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,740\nYou were probably gonna go in.\n\n484\n00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,290\nThey can't arrest you on intent and\nwe can't get you on those ping sweeps,\n\n485\n00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:59,290\nbut if your EULA says you're not\nsupposed to be doing them, so\n\n486\n00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,980\nyou could end of getting\na nasty gram From your ISP.\n\n487\n00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,570\nHey look, we see you running ping sweeps.\n\n488\n00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:07,090\nIf you don't cease and\ndesist we're gonna cut off your service.\n\n489\n00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:09,140\nSo, keep that in mind.\n\n490\n00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:13,260\nOn your home network, a little test\nnetwork or something, that's fine.\n\n491\n00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,500\nIf you don't, do it at work unless\nyou get the appropriate permissions.\n\n492\n00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,070\n>> Yeah.\n\n493\n00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,440\nAnd I've heard about people doing that.\n\n494\n00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,340\nThey say oh, I wanna try this myself.\n\n495\n00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,010\nLet me go and scan Facebook, or\nscan Google or whatever, and you do it.\n\n496\n00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:27,390\nYour scan might work and\nyour ISP then shuts off your service.\n\n497\n00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,720\nSo that is kind of where that goes.\n\n498\n00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,130\nYeah, you do have to scan responsibly.\n\n499\n00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,240\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n500\n00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,930\nKeep it in a little sandbox environment or\n\n501\n00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,060\nin your home is a great place to\nplay with these kind of tools.\n\n502\n00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,749\n>> All right.\nWell, Mike,\n\n503\n00:24:37,749 --> 00:24:39,685\nI think is a pretty good rundown\nof reconnaissance tools.\n\n504\n00:24:39,685 --> 00:24:43,395\nWe've seen what they are and how\nthe reconnaissance attack is pulled off.\n\n505\n00:24:43,395 --> 00:24:44,345\nIt is a real danger.\n\n506\n00:24:44,345 --> 00:24:46,183\nIt is the first sign of an attack.\n\n507\n00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:48,092\nIt's that first stage\nan attacker goes through.\n\n508\n00:24:48,092 --> 00:24:50,785\nSo, definitely something we wanna\nwatch out for and protect from.\n\n509\n00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,120\nWe didn't really tackle it.\n\n510\n00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,850\nWe cover it more in the social\nengineering show about how\n\n511\n00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,520\nthat's kind of part of reconnaissance too.\n\n512\n00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,130\nSo, there's other things that tie into it.\n\n513\n00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,940\nBut this is a pretty good overview,\nI think.\n\n514\n00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,580\nHave anything else to tack on there?\n\n515\n00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,230\n>> I don't think so,\n\n516\n00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:07,450\nother than knowing what's running on your\nown system is a big part of security.\n\n517\n00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:12,360\nYou can help protect your network, protect\nyour own system if you just look and\n\n518\n00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,955\nsee what's going on and\nnot just assume everything is\n\n519\n00:25:14,955 --> 00:25:18,280\nokay until the bad guy finds it for\nyou and takes advantage of it.\n\n520\n00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,910\n>> All right, well ladies gentlemen\nthis is a pretty good spot for\n\n521\n00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:22,700\nus to wrap it up.\n\n522\n00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,420\nI hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n523\n00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,600\nSigning off for ITProTV I'm

another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:16,900\nI'll be your host, Daniel Lowrey.\n\n5\n00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,200\nHere with me today is none\nother than Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,101\nHow you doing today, Mike?\n\n7\n00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:21,451\n>> I'm doing fantastic, Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:25,930\nWe've got another great show coming your\nway in our Security Fundamentals series.\n\n9\n00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,990\nAnd in this one we're gonna\nbe talking about Firewalls.\n\n10\n00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:35,080\nNow a firewall is simply a way that I can\nprotect my network and/or my computers.\n\n11\n00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,650\nWe'll talk about where\nwe place these firewalls\n\n12\n00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,150\nfrom traffic that I don't want, right?\n\n13\n00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,920\nWhen we look at a way a computer\ncommunicates it sends data out across\n\n14\n00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,530\na network and that data and\n\n15\n00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,360\nthen there's data that comes\nback to my computer as well.\n\n16\n00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,050\nAnd a firewall is a way that I can\nblock certain types of traffic.\n\n17\n00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,980\nMaybe I don't want, for example, remote\ndesktop traffic coming into my computer,\n\n18\n00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,295\nwell, my firewall Firewall will allow me\nto block that type of traffic, right?\n\n19\n00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:05,115\nThere's a lot of bad guys out there that\nare using different protocols to connect\n\n20\n00:01:05,115 --> 00:01:06,615\nor attempt to connect to your computer.\n\n21\n00:01:06,615 --> 00:01:09,575\nAnd that firewall really is our\nfirst line of defense, right?\n\n22\n00:01:09,575 --> 00:01:11,715\n>> Yeah, it really acts like\na gatekeeper if you would.\n\n23\n00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:15,460\nIt's kind of the bouncer at your\nlocal club or something like that.\n\n24\n00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,080\nHe's got the list, and who's on the list,\nif you're on the list,\n\n25\n00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,410\nwell, you're not getting in.\n\n26\n00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,650\nThat's basically what he's doing.\n\n27\n00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,590\nHe's checking all the traffic that might\nwant to come through there to make sure\n\n28\n00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,675\nthat it's actually traffic that\nyou want or need or whatever, and\n\n29\n00:01:27,675 --> 00:01:32,105\nit's not just some person out there, or\nmaybe one of these malicious guys Mike was\n\n30\n00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:37,645\ntalking about, that's attempting to gain\naccess maliciously without authorization.\n\n31\n00:01:37,645 --> 00:01:42,885\nSo that firewall is really\na very important part of our day\n\n32\n00:01:42,885 --> 00:01:47,100\nto day computing systems, because without\nit we'd have all sorts of compromises.\n\n33\n00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,970\n>> Absolutely, and we want to look at\nthe technical side just for a second.\n\n34\n00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,250\nThere are really 65,535 ports or\n\n35\n00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,961\nentryways into your system, right?\n\n36\n00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:01,550\nThat's 65,000 ports plus.\n\n37\n00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,060\n>> That's a lot.\n\n38\n00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,720\n>> Yes, that's a lot and\nthat's what that firewall's gonna do.\n\n39\n00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,430\nThat firewall's gonna say, you know what?\n\n40\n00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,300\nI'm gonna close them all.\n\n41\n00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,573\nI'm gonna shut them all down,\nand then we're gonna pick and\n\n42\n00:02:10,573 --> 00:02:12,316\nchoose which ones we want open.\n\n43\n00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:16,738\nNow we don't really have to understand\nwhat all 65,000 ports are for, and\n\n44\n00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:18,631\nbecause of our firewall, right?\n\n45\n00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:19,996\nHe goes and shut them down.\n\n46\n00:02:19,996 --> 00:02:23,780\nThe only ones we really have to understand\nare the ones that we want to allow\n\n47\n00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,000\nthrough.\n\n48\n00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,660\nFor example, like web traffic.\n\n49\n00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,440\nIf I'm running a web server,\n\n50\n00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,290\nthen the port number that's associated\nwith web traffic is Port 80.\n\n51\n00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,860\nSo if I'm a business and I'm running\na firewall at the edge of our corporate\n\n52\n00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,130\nnetwork and I want people from the outside\nto be able to come into my network,\n\n53\n00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:45,120\nconnect to my web server, and buy my\nproduct, then I need to open up Port 80.\n\n54\n00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,330\nTo let that traffic through, right?\n\n55\n00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:52,010\nNow we can have firewall sitting at\nthe network edge and we almost always do.\n\n56\n00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,350\nWe can also run firewalls on\nthe individual host as well.\n\n57\n00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,240\nGiving us another layer of security.\n\n58\n00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,900\nAll right?\n\n59\n00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,120\nNow, at the enterprise level,\nwell, let me back up.\n\n60\n00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,920\nWe've got hardware based firewalls and\nwe also have software based firewalls.\n\n61\n00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,860\nA hardware based firewall is a device, a\nphysical thing that I can go and purchase.\n\n62\n00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,040\nAnd say if I'm an IT person, I put this\nin my rack in my server closet and\n\n63\n00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,700\nI route all that traffic through there,\nright?\n\n64\n00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,510\nThese are things like Cisco or\nJuniper or even pfSense.\n\n65\n00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,890\nIn fact I can show you a quick screenshot\nhere, or a little image of pfSense.\n\n66\n00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,820\nI'm on their website, and I can go in down\nhere and I can click on their products.\n\n67\n00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,840\nAnd I can see they've got\nthe option to either buy.\n\n68\n00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,205\nNow things like Cisco and Jupiter,\nthose guys are proprietary, right?\n\n69\n00:03:41,205 --> 00:03:45,550\nYou've gotta pay good money to buy those\ndevices, you've got to buy licenses for\n\n70\n00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,620\neach person typically that's gonna\nconnect through that firewall.\n\n71\n00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,550\nSo if I'm an enterprise, that's okay.\n\n72\n00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:55,260\nIf I'm a small business or\nmaybe a so-ho, a home office or\n\n73\n00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,930\nsomething like that if I don't\nwant to spend that much money.\n\n74\n00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,710\nSome of these other solutions\nlike PFSense, for example,\n\n75\n00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:05,020\nyou can buy a hardware device from\nthem with their firewall loaded on it.\n\n76\n00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,050\nYou can even download their firewall\nsoftware and build your own device.\n\n77\n00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,540\nMaybe you've got an old computer all\nyou need to basically and Intel Atom or\n\n78\n00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,780\nabout processor and\nyou could build your own firewall.\n\n79\n00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,560\n>> Yeah that's really cool.\n\n80\n00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,810\nThat you can just reclamate maybe some\nold equipment save yourself a little\n\n81\n00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,910\nbit of coin.\n\n82\n00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,480\nAnd that you can take this software\nfirewall, install it on a piece of\n\n83\n00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,480\nold hardware, and then you've kind of\ngot the best of both worlds, right?\n\n84\n00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,120\nAnd you can even run their software\nfirewall on your own desktop if\n\n85\n00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,565\nyou want it as well.\n\n86\n00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,520\nThe pfSence we do endorse\nthem a lot around here\n\n87\n00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,080\njust because of the ease of use and\nit does a really good job.\n\n88\n00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,880\nBut for us as an end user for\n\n89\n00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,610\na home user something like that\nthat might be a little too much.\n\n90\n00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,780\nSo we need we want take a look at\nsome other solutions as well in fact.\n\n91\n00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,790\nMost of you are probably running\na firewall and you don't even know it.\n\n92\n00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,790\nEither it's built into your operating\nsystem, or if you're at home and you've\n\n93\n00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,440\ngot one of those little wireless access\npoints which almost everybody has, right.\n\n94\n00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,110\nYou got that cable connection coming in or\nthat Internet connection coming in\n\n95\n00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,020\nit hits a modem and then it splits off and\nyour little wireless access point.\n\n96\n00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,450\nWell built into most of\nthose devices is a firewall,\n\n97\n00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,380\nthat allows me to control again that\ntraffic that's coming into my network.\n\n98\n00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,310\nBecause my home is connected\nto the Internet and\n\n99\n00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,300\nthink of all the bad people out there.\n\n100\n00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,600\nI don't want them connecting to my devices\non my internal network at my house.\n\n101\n00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,210\nSo I wanna show you a quick example here\nbecause when you look at these devices,\n\n102\n00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,330\nlike those wireless access points,\nsome of them don't call it a firewall.\n\n103\n00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,220\nRight, Daniel?\n\n104\n00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,750\nLike, when we look here, this is\na little Cisco wireless access point.\n\n105\n00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,600\nAnd if I look at my tabs I don't\nsee firewall anywhere on here.\n\n106\n00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,050\nBut if I go to application in gaming,\nthis is where I\n\n107\n00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,900\ncan see these are basically my firewall\nsettings for this particular device.\n\n108\n00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,130\nNow each one, a D-link,\nor anything like that,\n\n109\n00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,410\nthese are gonna be slightly different so\nyou have to look at your instructions for\n\n110\n00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,340\nthat particular device or\ngo out there and search on the Internet.\n\n111\n00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:05,360\nBut here if I want to allow a port through\nmy wireless access point I can come\n\n112\n00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,080\nover here and I can give it a name\nmaybe I call it something like R.D.P.\n\n113\n00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,710\nfor remote desktop or something like that.\n\n114\n00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,740\nAnd then I can choose the port.\n\n115\n00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,720\nIn our example 3389 is my\nremote desktop port number, and\n\n116\n00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,670\nI can go from 3389 to 3389.\n\n117\n00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,590\nI can choose both UDP and TCP,\n\n118\n00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:30,480\nand I can tell the IP address\nthat I want to port that on too.\n\n119\n00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,600\nAnd I'm just making something up.\n\n120\n00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,490\nThis is just a little simulation.\n\n121\n00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,435\nAnd I'll enable that rule.\n\n122\n00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,370\nMotor IP of the,\nI guess that was the IP address.\n\n123\n00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,330\n>> Yeah, the broadcast address.\n\n124\n00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,190\n>> We'll say 33 there.\n\n125\n00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,890\n>> Yeah, you do need to actually give\nthe host that you're looking for.\n\n126\n00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,340\nWe're just doing a testing thing so\nit's not that big of a deal.\n\n127\n00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,130\nBut if you were at home,\n\n128\n00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,390\nyou would actually put the IP\naddress of the computer that\n\n129\n00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,240\nyou would want to connect with and\nthat's what would go there.\n\n130\n00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,920\n>> Exactly, I click save my changes, and\nI click continue and now I've got, and\n\n131\n00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,270\nagain, this is a simulation, so\n\n132\n00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,090\nit doesn't look like it's actually\nsaving my changes or anything.\n\n133\n00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:09,000\nBut that's how I would\nenable an exception.\n\n134\n00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,650\nSo if I needed to allow\na particular protocol through,\n\n135\n00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,660\nthen I would just find my configuration\npage for my wireless access point.\n\n136\n00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,140\nSo this would be data or\ntraffic that's coming from the outside,\n\n137\n00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,400\nfrom the Internet.\n\n138\n00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,590\nComing back into my home network.\n\n139\n00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,400\nSo if I want to sit at work and\n\n140\n00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,300\nI want to be able to remote\ninto my computer at home.\n\n141\n00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,820\nWell that firewall's gonna be blocking\nthe ports associated with that remote\n\n142\n00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,910\ndesktop protocol.\n\n143\n00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,500\nMaybe you've gone out and\nbought something like PC anywhere or\n\n144\n00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,790\none of those programs they'll let you\nknow what ports you need to enable.\n\n145\n00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,870\nYou don't have to go out, and\nyou have to know all these.\n\n146\n00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,960\nThat program, they should tell you\nwhat ports you need to enable.\n\n147\n00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,240\nYou come into your configuration\npage you enable that port.\n\n148\n00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,140\nYou forward it onto a particular IP\naddress on your network that you wanna\n\n149\n00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,800\nconnect to, and\nbada bing you're good to go.\n\n150\n00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,443\n>> Yeah, that's one of the best\nthings about any third party or\n\n151\n00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:57,951\nproprietary software.\n\n152\n00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,891\nThey do need you to enable a port.\n\n153\n00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:02,534\nThey usually inform you of that\nin the actual documentation.\n\n154\n00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:07,256\nThey'll say you need to open up port 3204,\nsomething to that effect.\n\n155\n00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:10,951\nThey'll let you know what that is so\nyou're not going, oh, I'm not a computer\n\n156\n00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:14,060\nguy and I don't know everything\nthere is to know about computers.\n\n157\n00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,110\nWell, that's okay,\n\n158\n00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:19,165\nthey should have a very good step by step\non what port it is you need to open up.\n\n159\n00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:23,635\nAnd just having some basic knowledge of\nthe type of firewall that they're using,\n\n160\n00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:28,470\nwhether it'll be Windows or something like\nyour router like Mike is showing you here.\n\n161\n00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,420\nShould be pretty straightforward.\n\n162\n00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,290\n>> Exactly.\n\n163\n00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,740\nAnd so that would be an example\nof a hardware based firewall at\n\n164\n00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,670\nthe consumer level.\n\n165\n00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:39,930\nSo we've got those enterprise level\nfirewalls like Cisco and Juniper, and\n\n166\n00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,124\nthen you got your consumer level firewalls\nthat are typically built into those\n\n167\n00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:46,890\nmulti-purpose devices like\nyour wireless access points or\n\n168\n00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,990\npossibly even the modem that you're using,\ndepending on what you're doing.\n\n169\n00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,070\nAnd those are designed to\nprotect my entire network,\n\n170\n00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,390\nwhatever network I'm setting up.\n\n171\n00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,850\nWhether I'm talking about my work network\nor if I'm talking about a home network or\n\n172\n00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,200\na small office.\n\n173\n00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,300\nBut we also have firewalls that\nrun on the individual hosts, and\n\n174\n00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,530\nthose firewalls protect\njust that one machine.\n\n175\n00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:10,480\nSo if I have five machines, I would need\nto run that firewall on each one of those.\n\n176\n00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,370\nNow it might seem redundant.\n\n177\n00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,310\nYou might think, well why?\n\n178\n00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,000\nWhy would I need a firewall\non my individual host\n\n179\n00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,050\nif I've already got a firewall\nat the edge of my network?\n\n180\n00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,060\nThat's protecting me from the outside,\nfrom the bad guys.\n\n181\n00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,060\nAnd the answer is you could\nI guess Daniel, right?\n\n182\n00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,540\nYou could run without\na firewall on your hosts.\n\n183\n00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,040\n>> Yeah you could definitely do that,\n\n184\n00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,270\nbut it tends to be when you have\nlike a network where you're actually\n\n185\n00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,410\nmaybe even doing some business from it or\nyour home network.\n\n186\n00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,900\nMaybe you want to block stuff\ngoing to these three computers but\n\n187\n00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,830\nthis computer doesn't need that blocked,\nor these three computers, it\n\n188\n00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:46,860\ndoesn't matter if it's blocked or not cuz\nthey're not using it, but this one does.\n\n189\n00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,640\nSo you have to open that up.\n\n190\n00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,520\nNow, the easiest thing to do is\njust have that port open and\n\n191\n00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,990\nany computer that wanted to use it at at\nthe edge, maybe in your wireless router or\n\n192\n00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,140\nsomething like that.\n\n193\n00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,500\nYou could open it up there and\n\n194\n00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,870\nthen block it on the other three\ncomputers and open it for the other one.\n\n195\n00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,840\nThat makes it a little bit easier,\n\n196\n00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,440\njust depends on your\nphilosophy I guess of design.\n\n197\n00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,080\n>> Yeah.\n>> In the way you're\n\n198\n00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,860\nsetting up your network.\n\n199\n00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,580\nWhatever's easiest for\nyou to be honest with you.\n\n200\n00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,800\nBut that might be one of the reasons\nthat you would go that way.\n\n201\n00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,390\n>> Exactly and\n\n202\n00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,830\nanytime we talk about security,\nwe always talk about layers of defense.\n\n203\n00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,593\nAnd if I've just got that one firewall at\nthe edge of my network that's my line of\n\n204\n00:10:23,593 --> 00:10:25,740\ndefense but\nthat's my only line of defense.\n\n205\n00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,600\nSo somebody makes it through there,\n\n206\n00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,410\nnow they got free range over all\nthe computers on my network.\n\n207\n00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,730\nWhereas if I've got layers of\nfirewalls on each computer\n\n208\n00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,050\nthat can help it acts as a second layer\nthey get through the first layer,\n\n209\n00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,080\nthey've still got to make it\nthrough that second layer.\n\n210\n00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,270\nOr what if they compromise one\nof the machines on my network?\n\n211\n00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,770\nNow they're inside my network and\n\n212\n00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,600\ncan they spread out to other\ncomputers on my network, right?\n\n213\n00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,640\nIf they infect one machine does\nthat virus spread to the others?\n\n214\n00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,440\nI don't have firewalls on\nthose individual machines,\n\n215\n00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,840\nthe answer is most likely yes, all right?\n\n216\n00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,490\nBecause you've got nothing\nleft to protect it.\n\n217\n00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,260\nThe data's not going out and\nthen coming back in.\n\n218\n00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,950\nIt's already inside, so it's just gonna\nbounce from one machine to another.\n\n219\n00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,430\nAnd we have many solutions when\nwe talk about host base or\n\n220\n00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,250\neach individual computer firewalls.\n\n221\n00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,400\nBut with most of these\nare gonna be software based and\n\n222\n00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,670\nsome examples I can pull up.\n\n223\n00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,570\nThere are some free ones out there,\nthere's some pay ones out there.\n\n224\n00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:21,640\nIf you've bought one of those suites like\nMcAfee or Norton or somebody like that,\n\n225\n00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,015\nit very well could have a firewall as well\nas some other products like anti-virus and\n\n226\n00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:29,000\nanti-spyware and add wear and\nthings like that.\n\n227\n00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,930\nOr like here Zone Alarm,\nthis is the one I've used before.\n\n228\n00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,345\nThey've got a free version where\nit's just a firewall no extra bells,\n\n229\n00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:37,780\nno whistles but it's free right.\n\n230\n00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,170\nSo I can download that and\nI can install that on my machine.\n\n231\n00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,090\nOr I could use what's built\ninto my operating system.\n\n232\n00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,720\nMost of our OSs nowadays have\na firewall built into them.\n\n233\n00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,680\nWindows 8, Windows 8.1, for example,\nhas a really good firewall built into it.\n\n234\n00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,510\nAnd all you have to do is know where to\nfind it so that you can go configure that.\n\n235\n00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,330\nAnd I'll pull up a virtual machine here.\n\n236\n00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,930\nActually, I think I'll\nstart on my own machine.\n\n237\n00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,740\nSo what I'm gonna do,\nI'm on a Windows 8.1 box and\n\n238\n00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,980\nI've gone into my control panel and\nthen system in security.\n\n239\n00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,860\nI'm going to click on Windows Firewall.\n\n240\n00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,040\nAnd this brings me to my firewall.\n\n241\n00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,960\nNow, the way Windows handles firewalls,\n\n242\n00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,700\nit kind of divides your networks up into\nthese categories because it allows me\n\n243\n00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,900\nto configure settings differently based on\nthe type of network that I'm connected to.\n\n244\n00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,930\nSo with my laptop, it's mobile.\n\n245\n00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,100\nSo I can connect to my network at work.\n\n246\n00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,900\nI take it home and\nI connect to my home network.\n\n247\n00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,600\nI go out to Starbucks and\npick up some coffee,\n\n248\n00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,510\nI can connect to the network there.\n\n249\n00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,480\nWell, I wanna apply different settings\nbased on those networks, right?\n\n250\n00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,990\nIf I'm at home, I want to allow, say,\nRemote Desktop, because I use that\n\n251\n00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,320\nto connect from my living room\nmachine over into my office machine or\n\n252\n00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,630\nsomething like that.\n\n253\n00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,540\nWhen I'm at Starbucks,\n\n254\n00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:00,090\nhowever, I don't need anybody using\nRemote Desktop to connect to my machine.\n\n255\n00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,968\nSo maybe I want to block that, and so\nWindows gives us what they call profiles.\n\n256\n00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:07,570\nAnd you can see I've got my private\nnetworks, which covers like my work\n\n257\n00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:13,130\nnetwork and my home network and they\nalso have my guest or public networks.\n\n258\n00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,360\nAnd so\nI can choose where to make my exceptions.\n\n259\n00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,740\nAnd exceptions are what we call\nthe holes in the firewall.\n\n260\n00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,890\nSo if I wanna allow something through,\n\n261\n00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,450\nI'm gonna make an exception to\nallow that type of traffic through.\n\n262\n00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:29,770\nNow in Windows with our basic firewall\nsettings, I've got a easy link here.\n\n263\n00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,990\nAllow an app or\na feature through the Windows firewall.\n\n264\n00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,690\nAll I have to do is click on that, and\nit opens up this little dialog box and\n\n265\n00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,889\nI'm gonna tell it I wanna\nchange some of these settings.\n\n266\n00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,970\nAnd what I see here is all\nthe different programs\n\n267\n00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:45,470\nthat I've got installed on my computer.\n\n268\n00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,570\nAnd so\nif I wanna allow one of these through,\n\n269\n00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:52,505\nlet's say we wanna allow,\nwhat's a good one to try here?\n\n270\n00:13:52,505 --> 00:13:53,830\nLooks like all the good\nones are already enabled.\n\n271\n00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:57,605\n>> Remote Shutdown.\n\n272\n00:13:57,605 --> 00:14:00,370\n>> Remote Shutdown, let's do that,\ncuz I know Daniel's gonna reach out and.\n\n273\n00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,135\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or let's do Windows Remote Management.\n\n274\n00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:06,535\nSo anyway, either way you find the program\nthat you wanna allow through there and\n\n275\n00:14:06,535 --> 00:14:08,350\nyou simply put a check mark there.\n\n276\n00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,880\nTo allow that program.\n\n277\n00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,690\nAnd out here to the right, I've got\nmy private and I've got my public.\n\n278\n00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,700\nSo you can see it enabled it on private.\n\n279\n00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,070\nI could also choose to\nenable it on public.\n\n280\n00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,590\nI could uncheck my private seconds, or\n\n281\n00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,800\nI can do both, right,\ndepending on what I want to do.\n\n282\n00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,730\nFor remote management,\n\n283\n00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,430\nthis is what my help desk uses to\nconnect to my computer when I'm at work.\n\n284\n00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,530\nSo I want them to be able to reach out and\nfix my machine when I've got a problem.\n\n285\n00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,650\nSo I'm gonna enable on\nthe private network.\n\n286\n00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:38,410\nI don't want anybody at the hotel or\nStarbucks trying to reach out and\n\n287\n00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:43,280\nremotely manage my machine, so I'm not\ngonna check that on that public profile.\n\n288\n00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,740\nI click, and that's it.\n\n289\n00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,370\nI click OK.\n\n290\n00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:50,540\nAnd now that added an exception for\nthat particular program.\n\n291\n00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,790\n>> Now Mike, this really shows how\na firewall could really be a double edged\n\n292\n00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,600\nsword, right?\n\n293\n00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,910\nIf it's not being used properly.\n\n294\n00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,270\nYou don't have at least some basic\nunderstanding of how they work,\n\n295\n00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,360\nyou could be blocking something.\n\n296\n00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,210\nLike Mike said, if he's got a help\ndesk call and someone's like,\n\n297\n00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,380\nI need your help to look at this computer.\n\n298\n00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,550\nHe tries to use that Windows Manager\nRemote Management session and\n\n299\n00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,420\nit's not happening, right?\n\n300\n00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,410\nAnd he's trying to get in,\nnothing's going on.\n\n301\n00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,950\nHe's like, well, I can ping your machine,\nI can do this, I can do that, but\n\n302\n00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,310\nI can't actually make a connection.\n\n303\n00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,240\nAnd you're trying to figure\nout what might the problem be.\n\n304\n00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,520\nWell it could be the firewall's\nactually blocking that connection.\n\n305\n00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,470\nSo we have to go into that firewall\nsetting, make sure that check mark\n\n306\n00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,730\nwas there and then apply it and\nthen Mike would be able to\n\n307\n00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,020\nactually remote into that system and see\nwhat's going on and start helping them.\n\n308\n00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,470\nSo it is definitely something that has\na practical application, because, well,\n\n309\n00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,640\nif you're running Windows, if you're\nrunning a Mac OS, a lot of them have\n\n310\n00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,050\na firewall that's already installed that's\nalready running to at least some degree.\n\n311\n00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,400\nYou may need to go in there and make\nsome setting changes from time to time,\n\n312\n00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,760\njust for those types of various reasons.\n\n313\n00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,513\n>> Exactly.\nAlways wanna check those default\n\n314\n00:15:55,513 --> 00:15:56,334\nconfigurations.\n\n315\n00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:58,135\nYou wanna make sure it's turned on.\n\n316\n00:15:58,135 --> 00:15:59,747\nI know like in Windows for example,\n\n317\n00:15:59,747 --> 00:16:02,122\nwe'll get a little flag\ndown in our system tracing.\n\n318\n00:16:02,122 --> 00:16:03,703\nHey, you've got some issues.\n\n319\n00:16:03,703 --> 00:16:06,423\nYou click on it,\nit's gonna take you over your firewall so\n\n320\n00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:09,730\nyou need to turn on your firewall\nto keep yourself protected.\n\n321\n00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,820\nWe had a good question out there\nin the chat room too I think.\n\n322\n00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,310\nFabian asked, are the OS firewalls enough?\n\n323\n00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,460\nWhy would I need a third party firewall?\n\n324\n00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,610\nWell, back in the day, if we go way\nback to like, XP for example, for\n\n325\n00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,150\nWindows, there was no OS firewall, right?\n\n326\n00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:26,059\nSo you had to go get a third party\nutility in order to have a firewall,\n\n327\n00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:27,580\na host-based firewall.\n\n328\n00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,996\nBut that's changed, so\nover the years now it's all incorporated,\n\n329\n00:16:31,996 --> 00:16:34,775\nI know Mac OS X has\na firewall built into it.\n\n330\n00:16:34,775 --> 00:16:36,830\nSo now they're built in and\n\n331\n00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,340\nthe answer is really,\nyou don't need to go out and buy one.\n\n332\n00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,700\nI love the Windows firewall, they've\nadded a lot of functionality to it,\n\n333\n00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,340\nit has all the features that you're\ngonna see in most of your paid versions.\n\n334\n00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,833\nSo I don't have a need for it but,\nmaybe I bought one of those suites, right,\n\n335\n00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,570\ncuz I still need antivirus, anti-malware.\n\n336\n00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:59,390\nMaybe I bought a suite, or maybe my\ncompany has a license for this product and\n\n337\n00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,490\nthey're letting me install it on my\nlaptop that I use when I travel back and\n\n338\n00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,096\nforth from work or what have you,\nand maybe they want to use that.\n\n339\n00:17:07,096 --> 00:17:09,640\nSo the answer to that question is,\nyou don't,\n\n340\n00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,080\nyou don't really need a third party,\nunless it's got some feature or\n\n341\n00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,950\nsome benefit that you're not getting\nfrom the one that's built into your OS.\n\n342\n00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:20,400\nBut I know and I think you've\nused the one on the Mac OS X.\n\n343\n00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,515\nPretty good firewall?\n\n344\n00:17:21,515 --> 00:17:23,852\n>> Yeah, yeah they're great,\nI've done Linux as well,\n\n345\n00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:25,950\nthe iptables is the name\nof the firewall on there.\n\n346\n00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:29,769\nThey all work fantastic, you just need to\nkinda get in there, learn a little bit\n\n347\n00:17:29,769 --> 00:17:33,770\nabout them, see how they operate, so that\nyou can effectively actually use them.\n\n348\n00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,300\nNow, the great thing is, especially with\nthe Windows firewall and the Mac firewall,\n\n349\n00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,440\nout of the gate they do a lot\nof good stuff for you already.\n\n350\n00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,700\nAnd that's why they already tell you,\nthey say,\n\n351\n00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,420\nthis is enabled by default, we have\na lot of great defaults already enabled.\n\n352\n00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,240\nAnd then you kinda have to go in there and\ncustomize it from time to time,\n\n353\n00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,850\ndepending on some software\nthat you may be installing or\n\n354\n00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,620\nprotocols you're trying to run so\nyou can make some connections.\n\n355\n00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,650\nAnd that's when you'd have\nto make some changes.\n\n356\n00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,970\nOther than that, right out of the box\nthese things do a really good job,\n\n357\n00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,490\nso you do want them to be enabled.\n\n358\n00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:07,720\nAnd only when you find a problem that's\nstopping you from doing something\n\n359\n00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,000\ndo you really need to get in there and\nmake a change.\n\n360\n00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,750\nOr you said, you know what,\nI want to learn about firewalls.\n\n361\n00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,480\nI wanna get in there and\nunderstand them a little bit better.\n\n362\n00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,490\nAnd you get some knowledge underneath\nyour belt, and then get in there and\n\n363\n00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,950\nyou can start making\nsome customizable tweaks.\n\n364\n00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,160\nOn the enterprise level,\nit's a different story.\n\n365\n00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,408\nI mean, the third party firewalls, the\nactual appliances are a necessity, right,\n\n366\n00:18:27,408 --> 00:18:29,830\nbecause of the many\ndifferent types of traffic.\n\n367\n00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:35,780\nAnd they're just so much far and\nabove and in terms of the abilities\n\n368\n00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,590\nthat they can do versus the software\nfirewalls that are on your desktop.\n\n369\n00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:42,710\nNot that you still don't use those and\nthey're great and they're fine to have.\n\n370\n00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:47,048\nBut if you're inside of an enterprise\nlevel place you could probably turn those\n\n371\n00:18:47,048 --> 00:18:50,997\noff because those enterprise level\nfirewalls are doing a bang-up job,\n\n372\n00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:51,660\nI'm sure.\n\n373\n00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,550\n>> Exactly, yeah, and David out there\nin the chat brings up a good point too.\n\n374\n00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,640\nThe Windows firewall, for example, when\nit first started out, it was very basic.\n\n375\n00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,700\nIt would allow you to make\nan exception based on a program, and\n\n376\n00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,430\nit was just for\ninbound traffic coming into your machine.\n\n377\n00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,880\nNow they've got,\nwhat I showed you was the simple console,\n\n378\n00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,245\nI could take you to the advanced\nsettings on the firewall.\n\n379\n00:19:13,245 --> 00:19:16,365\nAnd there we've got inbound rules and\noutbound rules and\n\n380\n00:19:16,365 --> 00:19:19,095\nyou can do it by IP address and\nthings like that, so\n\n381\n00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:22,965\nthat these OS firewalls really\nhave grown in their capabilities.\n\n382\n00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:24,177\nBut again, it's a personal thing.\n\n383\n00:19:24,177 --> 00:19:27,660\nSo if, like I said, if you've already\npurchased one or if you get one of those\n\n384\n00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,960\nsuites, the suites are nice because\neverything kinda works together, right?\n\n385\n00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,540\nThey're designed by the same company,\nso the firewall and the antivirus and\n\n386\n00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,440\nthe anti spyware all ties in nicely.\n\n387\n00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,220\nIt probably gives you very nice\nreports and things like that.\n\n388\n00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,450\nSo maybe that's your preference.\n\n389\n00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,550\nOr maybe if you don't have one that\nthe company bought you or you haven't\n\n390\n00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:48,630\nalready bought one, just make sure you\nturn on that one in your operating system.\n\n391\n00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,580\nAnd I can show you one more\nthing I want to show everybody.\n\n392\n00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,820\nWe talk about these firewalls,\nI'll show you one in action.\n\n393\n00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,500\nWhat I've got here is I've got\na couple virtual machines.\n\n394\n00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,290\nAnd on this second virtual machine,\n\n395\n00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:04,630\nwhoops, that is not what\nI wanted to click on.\n\n396\n00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:08,600\nWe'll see that I have Remote Desktop\nturned off, all right.\n\n397\n00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,090\nSo if I go back over to\nmy first virtual machine,\n\n398\n00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,120\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nrun what's called a port scanner.\n\n399\n00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,120\nNow we'll have other episodes where\nwe break these port scanners down and\n\n400\n00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,900\ntalk a little bit about what they do.\n\n401\n00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,460\nBut in general, it's gonna reach\nout to that other machine, and\n\n402\n00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,460\nit's gonna knock on each\none of those ports.\n\n403\n00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,010\nAnd it's gonna let me know which ones\nare open and which ones are closed.\n\n404\n00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,630\nWell, in this case I'm just going\nto show which ones are open, right.\n\n405\n00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,190\nSo that's what they mean by a port scan.\n\n406\n00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,910\nAnd the bad guys are gonna use these\nto try to figure out what ports\n\n407\n00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,610\nyou have open, as well as potentially\nwhat operating system you're running.\n\n408\n00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:43,460\nBut again, we'll cover most\nof that in another episode.\n\n409\n00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,716\nSo here I am on Client 01,\n\n410\n00:20:44,716 --> 00:20:48,900\nI'm gonna reach out I'm gonna scan that\nother machine that I've got running.\n\n411\n00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,650\nAnd I'm just doing a quick scan so\nthat it will take too long, so\n\n412\n00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,030\nwe don't have to sit here and watch it.\n\n413\n00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:58,720\nI can do a really in-depth scan,\nit'll go through all 65,000 ports, but\n\n414\n00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,160\nit takes a little while for TV time.\n\n415\n00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:07,290\nAll right, so the results of this, if you\nguys can see that, there is no port 3389.\n\n416\n00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:11,649\nI happen to know port 3389 is the port for\nRemote Desktop, and\n\n417\n00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:15,340\nit's not listed here as\none of my open ports.\n\n418\n00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,980\nSo if I flip back over to that\nsecond virtual machine, and\n\n419\n00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:26,375\nI go into my Remote Settings, and\nI'm gonna choose to enable Remote Desktop.\n\n420\n00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:29,495\nNow I'll click OK to apply that change.\n\n421\n00:21:29,495 --> 00:21:34,285\nThen I'm gonna go back over to the first\nmachine, and I'm gonna run my scan again.\n\n422\n00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,680\nShould just take a second\nto get my results.\n\n423\n00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,900\nAnd I don't know if, I know it's a little\nbit small on that screen up there, but\n\n424\n00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:49,260\nright here I can see that port\n3389 is now listed as open.\n\n425\n00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,870\nSo that's a great example of\nopening up a port in a firewall.\n\n426\n00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,780\nNow, I didn't do it specifically, right?\n\n427\n00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,980\nI went into my operating system and\nsaid I want to allow Remote Desktop.\n\n428\n00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,330\nAnd what it did in the background\nwas make that exception.\n\n429\n00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,870\nI could have done it\nmanually if I wanted to.\n\n430\n00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,270\nI could come back over here and\n\n431\n00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:08,840\nwe could go take a look at my\nfirewall settings real quick.\n\n432\n00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,240\nIf I still have that guy open.\n\n433\n00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,100\nIt would have been the best thing to do,\nbut I'll find my firewall.\n\n434\n00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,780\nAnd I go into my Windows firewall.\n\n435\n00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,270\nAnd I'll take a look at my,\nonce it opens here, allow an app or\n\n436\n00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,750\nfeature through Windows firewall.\n\n437\n00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,804\nAnd if I scroll down through here,\n\n438\n00:22:31,804 --> 00:22:37,270\nwe'll see that Remote Desktop was\nenabled for that private network.\n\n439\n00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,770\nAgain, I could've done it manually.\n\n440\n00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:42,520\nI could've come in here to my firewall\nsettings and made that change here.\n\n441\n00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,650\nI did it through a little\nGUI in my System Properties.\n\n442\n00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:48,950\nBut what it was doing in the background\nwas reaching out and opening up that port.\n\n443\n00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,710\nAnd now Remote Desktop traffic will\nbe allowed through that firewall.\n\n444\n00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:57,020\nIf I turn that back off, then that Remote\nDesktop traffic is going to be blocked.\n\n445\n00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:01,081\nAlso notice that when I did it through the\nGUI, it chose to enable it on the private\n\n446\n00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:03,490\nnetwork, but\nnot the public network, right?\n\n447\n00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:07,661\nSo if there was a reason that I needed\nto enable Remote Desktop on the public\n\n448\n00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:12,120\nnetwork, I'd actually have to come in\nhere and check that check mark as well.\n\n449\n00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,686\n>> Yeah, you just got to remember\nwhen it comes to opening ports and\n\n450\n00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:20,444\nallowing traffic to go through these ports\nand making that access available, is that\n\n451\n00:23:20,444 --> 00:23:25,090\nthat's another available place that a bad\nguy could try to get into your computer.\n\n452\n00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,160\nSo you got to be really careful,\nyou do need to weigh them as a pro and\n\n453\n00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,410\ncon kind of thing.\n\n454\n00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,410\nDo I need this?\n\n455\n00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,160\nIf you don't need something running,\n\n456\n00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,615\nthen there's really no purpose\nof having that firewall open, or\n\n457\n00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:38,935\neven that the service is turned on or\nthat the software is installed.\n\n458\n00:23:38,935 --> 00:23:41,705\nSo if it's a third party software and\nyou're no longer using it,\n\n459\n00:23:41,705 --> 00:23:44,965\none of the best things you can do\nsecurity-wise is just uninstall it.\n\n460\n00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:48,555\nBecause then any firewall changes that\nyou've made on that, it doesn't matter\n\n461\n00:23:48,555 --> 00:23:52,952\nanymore because there's nothing there and\nthen you can go in there and shut that.\n\n462\n00:23:52,952 --> 00:23:56,950\nIf you did make an exception for that\nport, you can just remove that exception,\n\n463\n00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,920\nand everything's closed back down and\n\n464\n00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,992\nthat's one less way that a bad guy could\nprobably try to compromise your system.\n\n465\n00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:06,072\n>> Exactly, so\nin the end firewalls are devices or\n\n466\n00:24:06,072 --> 00:24:10,307\nsoftware that can help control\nthat traffic that's coming in and\n\n467\n00:24:10,307 --> 00:24:14,350\nout of your network, or in and\nout of a particular host.\n\n468\n00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,140\nNow on the hardware level on\nthe enterprise side we've got things like\n\n469\n00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:22,220\nCisco and Juniper and PFSense,\nor I can go buy a device and\n\n470\n00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,920\nI can protect my entire network.\n\n471\n00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,260\nOn the software side of things,\n\n472\n00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,890\nmore the host level,\nwe've got things like ZoneAlarm.\n\n473\n00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,540\nWe've got the built into\nthe operating system,\n\n474\n00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,332\nWindows has their Windows firewall,\n\n475\n00:24:33,332 --> 00:24:38,750\nOS X has their firewall built in there,\nand we can enable those on the host level.\n\n476\n00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,450\nAnd again, we're just making exceptions,\nallowing different types of traffic to\n\n477\n00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:46,040\ncome in, blocking types of traffic\nthat I don't want to block.\n\n478\n00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,030\nAnd if you don't understand the ports and\nthings like that, that's okay.\n\n479\n00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,850\nMost of your documentation for your\nsoftware is gonna tell you what ports you\n\n480\n00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:59,760\nneed to allow, or what ports that program\nneeds to use in order to work properly.\n\n481\n00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,640\nYou can go in there and\nmake that adjustment.\n\n482\n00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,360\n>> Excellent stuff wise words from Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n483\n00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,380\nHeed them, follow them in your daily life.\n\n484\n00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,450\nThey will help you out, keep you safe.\n\n485\n00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,960\nThat being said, Mike,\nhave we covered the bases here?\n\n486\n00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,030\nI think we've done a good general overview\nof what firewalls do and how they work.\n\n487\n00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,580\n>> I think so.\n\n488\n00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,470\nThe most important thing is,\nmake sure you're using it.\n\n489\n00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:20,370\nDon't turn it off, don't have somebody\ntell you, oh, just turn it off,\n\n490\n00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,000\nthat way everything will work.\n\n491\n00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,748\nYeah, everything will work as well as all\nthose bad guys that are trying to get in\n\n492\n00:25:24,748 --> 00:25:25,332\nthere, right.\n\n493\n00:25:25,332 --> 00:25:25,992\n>> That's right.\n\n494\n00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:29,470\n>> So that's the cop-out, you don't\njust turn it off to make something work.\n\n495\n00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,560\nDo your research,\n\n496\n00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,460\nfind out what port number that particular\napplication is using, make your exception.\n\n497\n00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,400\nAnd if it's on a profile basis like on\na Windows machine, make sure you're making\n\n498\n00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,240\nthe exception only on the network that\nthat application should be working on.\n\n499\n00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,020\n>> All right.\n\n500\n00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,850\nWell, that being said, I guess we've come\nto the end of another great episode.\n\n501\n00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,040\nI hope you've enjoyed it.\n\n502\n00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,330\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n503\n00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,230\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n504\n00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,415\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n505\n00:25:52,415 --> 00:25:58,170\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:14,800\nWelcome back to another action\npacked episode ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,920\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n6\n00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,380\nBack again, with Mr Mike Roderick.\n\n7\n00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,150\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n8\n00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,660\n>> It is going fantastic, Don.\n\n9\n00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,770\nI'm excited to be back.\n\n10\n00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,850\nWe've got another episode of our\nsecurity fundamentals coming your way.\n\n11\n00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,286\nAnd in this episode,\nwe're gonna talk all about updates.\n\n12\n00:00:28,286 --> 00:00:29,984\nWoohoo, exciting updates.\n\n13\n00:00:29,984 --> 00:00:31,995\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know it doesn't sound all\n\n14\n00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:36,490\nthat exciting, but in the end, it's\na very important part of security, and\n\n15\n00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,384\nit's a really easy thing to do as\nlong as we know what we're doing.\n\n16\n00:00:40,384 --> 00:00:42,670\nSo that's what we're\ngoing to discuss today.\n\n17\n00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,080\n>> So Mike, updates, that's the thing that\nthe vendors put into really annoy the heck\n\n18\n00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,890\nout of you when you wanna\nshut your PC down, right?\n\n19\n00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,630\nLike I'm trying to shut down,\nand it's doing 77 updates.\n\n20\n00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,540\n>> Please do not shut down your computer.\n\n21\n00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,300\nMake sure you're plugged\ninto a battery source.\n\n22\n00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,230\nThat's exactly what it is, Don.\n\n23\n00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:01,405\nAnd it's one of those things, what do\nyou say, the necessary evil, right.\n\n24\n00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:03,295\nAnd it involves everything.\n\n25\n00:01:03,295 --> 00:01:06,990\nIt's from our operating systems,\nthemselves, that has to be updated,\n\n26\n00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,672\napplications that were running\non the operating system.\n\n27\n00:01:09,672 --> 00:01:13,340\nWe're gonna talk about devices,\nthey need to be updated.\n\n28\n00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,600\nSo let's back up just a little bit.\n\n29\n00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,140\nWhen we talked about an update, what we're\ntalking about is you've bought a product.\n\n30\n00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,530\nYou've got a computer that's\nrunning say Windows 8.1, or\n\n31\n00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,160\nApple's latest operating system, or\na phone that's running a certain iOS.\n\n32\n00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,720\nWell, after these products come out, and\n\n33\n00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,950\nthey're used for a little bit,\nvulnerabilities are found.\n\n34\n00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,720\nPossibly a security vulnerability, or\nit could be a bug, or something that's not\n\n35\n00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,830\nworking quite right in that application or\nthat operating system.\n\n36\n00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,980\nAnd what the vendor's are gonna turn\naround and do is instead of making you buy\n\n37\n00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,990\na new product or deal with that\nvulnerability or leave you susceptible\n\n38\n00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,160\nto some type of an attack,\nthey're gonna put out a fix for it.\n\n39\n00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,770\nThey're gonna try to fix the problem or\npatch or close up that security hole.\n\n40\n00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,210\nAnd that's what we're talking\nabout when we talk about updates.\n\n41\n00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:01,750\nIt's our ability to get to download\nfrom somebody, not necessarily download,\n\n42\n00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,140\nbut obtain an update to fix a problem, or\n\n43\n00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,720\nto patch a hole, or\npossibly even to add functionality.\n\n44\n00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,190\nThey can have these updates that improve\nthe functionality of your device as well.\n\n45\n00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,680\nNow when we talk about updates,\nthere's different categories of updates.\n\n46\n00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,850\nAnd I don't know how important it is,\nbut when we go through updates,\n\n47\n00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,130\nwe can typically choose.\n\n48\n00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,360\nAnd that's why I wanna make sure\nwe understand what they are.\n\n49\n00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,090\nBecause some of them we might not want.\n\n50\n00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,830\nBut when we look at our updates in\ngeneral, like for an operating system.\n\n51\n00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,645\nThey're gonna break these updates\ndown in these different categories.\n\n52\n00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:35,445\nAnd they've got their patches,\n\n53\n00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:40,385\nhot fixes, security packs are probably\nthe big three I can think of, Don.\n\n54\n00:02:40,385 --> 00:02:41,435\nThose are the main ones.\n\n55\n00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:45,145\nAnd typically what we're talking\nabout is when we talk about a patch,\n\n56\n00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:49,480\nthat's a real quick fix to\nsome type of problem, right.\n\n57\n00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,410\nYou've bought a product or you've got\nthis new operating system installed, and\n\n58\n00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:53,950\nthere's a problem.\n\n59\n00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,550\nSomething is not working, something they\nmissed in development and testing and\n\n60\n00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,790\nthey wanna quickly get it fixed.\n\n61\n00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,210\nThey don't want you to have to wait\naround or deal with this buggy software.\n\n62\n00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:06,190\nSo they'll throw out a quick patch,\nand it fixes the problem, typically.\n\n63\n00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,720\nAnd then the thing about a patch\nis it's not security related,\n\n64\n00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,410\nit's fixing some kind like functionality.\n\n65\n00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,430\nAnd as a result they're\nnot really required.\n\n66\n00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,390\nIf it was some function that\ndidn't bother you, for example,\n\n67\n00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,960\nmaybe I'm running Microsoft Windows,\nand there's a bug in Microsoft Paint,\n\n68\n00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,560\ntheir little drawing utility,\nbut I don't use Microsoft Paint.\n\n69\n00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,080\nThen I don't care about that patch.\n\n70\n00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,715\nAnd if I don't deploy it,\nis there any harm in that, Mike?\n\n71\n00:03:27,715 --> 00:03:28,490\n>.\n>> Absolutely not.\n\n72\n00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,200\nIf you're not gonna use that product,\n\n73\n00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,960\nthere's really no point in\ngetting that patch, right.\n\n74\n00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,010\nSo it's just one less thing you've\ngotta download and install.\n\n75\n00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,560\nSo we've got our patches,\nthen we've got our hotfixes.\n\n76\n00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,580\nNow these are the ones that\nare typically security related.\n\n77\n00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,370\nThat means they found some vulnerability.\n\n78\n00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,410\nA lot of these big companies actually\npay people to test their software.\n\n79\n00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,000\nLike Microsoft,\nhas companies that do nothing but look for\n\n80\n00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,820\nvulnerabilities in that operating system,\noutside companies.\n\n81\n00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,890\nAnd then when they find one they\ncan report back to Microsoft,\n\n82\n00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,770\nMicrosoft can develop a hotfix.\n\n83\n00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,780\nAnd they call it a hotfix, it used to\ncome from those done back in the day,\n\n84\n00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,100\nit actually stemmed from the term\nof updating a live system,\n\n85\n00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,450\nsomething that was in production,\nthey called it a hotfix.\n\n86\n00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,270\nBut now we really, when we're talking\nabout security related updates, we call\n\n87\n00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,310\nthem hotfixes, cuz they're typically\nthings I wanna get right then and there,\n\n88\n00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,520\nas soon as it's available.\n\n89\n00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,460\nIf you think about it,\nthis is a known vulnerability, that means\n\n90\n00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,230\nsomebody already found this vulnerability,\nand they could take advantage of it.\n\n91\n00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:30,020\nThey could write some code, or take some\naction, to try to penetrate your system,\n\n92\n00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,530\nor take advantage of that vulnerability.\n\n93\n00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,000\nSo you wanna patch up against it.\n\n94\n00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,940\nYou wanna get that hot\nfix as soon as possible.\n\n95\n00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,900\n>> Yeah, and unlike a patch, where\nyou could say, I'm gonna ignore that,\n\n96\n00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,782\nor I'm busy now, let me wait until\nthis weekend, and I'll apply that.\n\n97\n00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:46,530\nWith a hot fix, you want that as\nsoon as possible, because the longer\n\n98\n00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,990\nyou run without applying that hotfix,\nthe more at risk you are.\n\n99\n00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,610\nSo a lot of companies will force these\nhotfix updates out on their machines.\n\n100\n00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,790\nIf you work for a large organization\nthat probably happens for you.\n\n101\n00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,090\nBut for you at home,\nit's up to you to manage that.\n\n102\n00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,230\nAnd a lot of people delays these.\n\n103\n00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,620\nThey put them.\nThey say I don't wanna mess\n\n104\n00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,490\nwith the updates.\n\n105\n00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,870\nAnd then leave them so vulnerable.\n\n106\n00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,040\n>> Absolutely.\nIt's like going, if you say,\n\n107\n00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,455\noh I don't wanna get this vaccine.\n\n108\n00:05:09,455 --> 00:05:11,260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's a disease out there\n\n109\n00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,850\nthat you could catch at any time.\n\n110\n00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,150\nI'll go get that vaccine someday.\n\n111\n00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,460\nWell before you know it, it's too late,\nand you've caught it, right?\n\n112\n00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,590\nAnd it was all your own fault\nbecause you could have gone and\n\n113\n00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,970\ngot the vaccine at any time.\n\n114\n00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,490\nIt's the same thing with these security\npatches or these hotfixes, right?\n\n115\n00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,930\nWhy wait, why put it off,\nget it is soon as you've got it.\n\n116\n00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,730\nThat way as soon as it's available,\nthat way you're not susceptible.\n\n117\n00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,240\nAnd then the third category I\nwanna talk about is service packs.\n\n118\n00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,905\nAnd over time, we're gonna get a lot\nof these patches that come out,\n\n119\n00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:42,675\na lot of these different hotfixes that\ncome out, and it begins to get tedious.\n\n120\n00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:47,095\nAnd if you get a brand new machine,\nlet's say Windows 8.1.\n\n121\n00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:50,905\nIf you right now took a machine,\ninstalled Windows 8.1 on it, well,\n\n122\n00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:53,785\nthat's a default install off of the DVD.\n\n123\n00:05:53,785 --> 00:05:56,385\nAs soon as you connect that to the\nInternet, it's going to go out and check\n\n124\n00:05:56,385 --> 00:06:00,200\nfor Windows Updates, and you're gonna\nhave over 90 something updates to do,\n\n125\n00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,860\nbecause there's all these updated been\ncoming out since Windows 8.1 was released.\n\n126\n00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,850\nSo what these companies will do,\nlike Microsoft,\n\n127\n00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,850\nis they'll create these roll ups they're\ngoing to call them service packs.\n\n128\n00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:16,800\nThis is when we're gonna take all those\nhotfixes and all those patches that\n\n129\n00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,950\nhave come out over the last period of\ntime and combine them into one, right.\n\n130\n00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,910\nThat way I've got one big\nthing to download, and\n\n131\n00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,790\nit's gonna be bigger, obviously.\n\n132\n00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,690\nIt's gonna contain all those patches and\nall those hot fixes, but\n\n133\n00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,230\nit's one download that it has to get and\ninstall.\n\n134\n00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,960\nAnd the other cool thing about service\npacks is, sometimes they can actually add\n\n135\n00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,750\nnew features, new functionality, to\nyour operating system or to your device.\n\n136\n00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:43,840\nI remember,\nthe one that always pops into my head was\n\n137\n00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,950\nXP Service Pack 3 was one\nthat brought in IPv6 support.\n\n138\n00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,910\nBecause when XP was first written,\nthere was no IP version 6.\n\n139\n00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,760\nAnd this is an addressing scheme, and\n\n140\n00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,260\nit's not important if you understand\nwhat that is at this point.\n\n141\n00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,070\nBut the original version\nof XP didn't support this.\n\n142\n00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,020\nAs time went by and this new addressing\nscheme came out, in the later operating\n\n143\n00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,130\nsystems, Windows Vista at the time,\nsupported it, Windows XP didn't.\n\n144\n00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,020\nWell if I was still running XP,\nI wanted that functionality.\n\n145\n00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,940\nI could get that Service Pack 3,\nand I could add that functionality.\n\n146\n00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,850\nAnd I even think that Windows Firewall\nwas another example of when\n\n147\n00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,510\none of the Service Packs is\nactually what introduced that.\n\n148\n00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,640\nIt wasn't available in\nthe original operating system.\n\n149\n00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,320\n>> Yeah, that was in XP Service Pack 2.\n\n150\n00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,430\nAnd Microsoft has kind\nof moved away from that.\n\n151\n00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:31,260\nThey used to always put in new\nfeatures with these service packs.\n\n152\n00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,660\nNow they've kind of scaled that back and\nsaid from now on the service packs,\n\n153\n00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,230\nthey're just gonna have hot fixes and\nupdates but not new functionality.\n\n154\n00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,127\nAnd the new functionality they\nput in these R2 editions.\n\n155\n00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:46,110\nYou'll see or hear things sometimes like\nwell, Windows 8 was a great example.\n\n156\n00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,910\nWe had Windows 8, then you had 8.1,\nthen you had Windows 8.1 with update.\n\n157\n00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,332\nIt was this crazy name.\n\n158\n00:07:51,332 --> 00:07:54,910\nAnd that with update, that was them adding\nnew features to Windows 8 that you didn't\n\n159\n00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,664\nhave in it prior.\n\n160\n00:07:55,664 --> 00:07:57,732\nSo sometimes you get weird terminology.\n\n161\n00:07:57,732 --> 00:07:59,098\nSometimes you miss that.\n\n162\n00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:02,404\nOther vendors are a little more\nstrict about it like Apple.\n\n163\n00:08:02,404 --> 00:08:04,789\nWhen you get a new update\nthat adds functionality,\n\n164\n00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:07,280\nit's typically an all new version number.\n\n165\n00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,767\nAnd so that changes things,\nlike when you go from 10.9 Mavericks to\n\n166\n00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:15,320\n10.10 Yosemite,\nthat's when they added new functionality.\n\n167\n00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,130\nBut when you go from 10.10 to 10.10.1,\nthey just add fixes, not functionality.\n\n168\n00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,760\nSo you see that different vendors\nhandle it different ways.\n\n169\n00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,130\nSo you might have to look for\nchanges or variations in terminology.\n\n170\n00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,990\n>> Yeah, it is, with those updates,\nlike the ones that add functionality,\n\n171\n00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,990\none of the big problems we have\nis they can introduce new issues.\n\n172\n00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,750\nRight, because this is\nan untested feature,\n\n173\n00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,590\nwell, tested but\nit hasn't been out in the wild.\n\n174\n00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,410\nSo we go and we get this Service Pack,\nand it adds new functionality, and all of\n\n175\n00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:45,780\na sudden, that new functionality requires\nan update or a fix or something like that.\n\n176\n00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,070\nAnd then our operating systems and\n\n177\n00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,780\napplications aren't the only thing\nthat's gonna require updates.\n\n178\n00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,720\nWe have hardware devices that\nare going to need updates.\n\n179\n00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,380\nWhen we talk about things\nyou put in your computer or\n\n180\n00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:01,020\nthings you plug into your computer\nlike that printer, or a sound card, or\n\n181\n00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,170\na video card, or something like that.\n\n182\n00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,850\nThese peripherals that we add on to our to\nour systems, we need drivers for those.\n\n183\n00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:12,560\nDrivers are bits of software that\nallow my computer to communicate and\n\n184\n00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,120\nuse that piece of hardware\nthat I'm adding on.\n\n185\n00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,920\nAnd same thing, those drivers themselves\nare gonna need updates, right.\n\n186\n00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,390\nThey might have had\na security vulnerability\n\n187\n00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,410\nin that graphics card driver that allowed\nsome kind of buffer overflow attack.\n\n188\n00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:32,240\nSo I need to go and get a later version of\nthe driver to prevent that, or a patch for\n\n189\n00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,030\nthat driver, usually typically put\nout as an update to the driver or\n\n190\n00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:39,180\na new version number to\nfix that vulnerability.\n\n191\n00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,090\nCertain hardware like routers and\n\n192\n00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:46,480\nthings like that have what we call\nfirmware where it's not a driver,\n\n193\n00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,770\nit's really more of a permanent software\nrunning off of a chip inside that device.\n\n194\n00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,730\nThat needs updates now and again.\n\n195\n00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,171\nThere could be vulnerabilities in that.\n\n196\n00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:59,430\nThere could be new options\nthey want to enable in that.\n\n197\n00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,096\nYou look at some of those Linksys routers,\n\n198\n00:10:01,096 --> 00:10:06,050\nyou can go get custom firmware that allows\nyou to do things with that router that\n\n199\n00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:11,010\nit that it wasn't able to do with that\nstock firmware that came from the vendor.\n\n200\n00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,470\nSo these are other things that we\ntypically need to update, right.\n\n201\n00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,930\n>> I find these are the ones\nthat are the most overlooked.\n\n202\n00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,640\nRight, because a lot of our\noperating systems these days will\n\n203\n00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,560\nautomatically do updates for us, but\nthey won't update your hardware drivers.\n\n204\n00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,496\nAnd maybe not on the security front but\nmore so on the functionality,\n\n205\n00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:31,001\nI'll hear people say like, man, my video\ncard's not working the way it should.\n\n206\n00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:33,441\nOr I can never print to that printer,\nit makes me so angry.\n\n207\n00:10:33,441 --> 00:10:36,870\nAnd then you go to the vendor's website,\nmaybe it's a printer, right.\n\n208\n00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,620\nSo if I have an HP printer,\nI go to HP's website, and sure enough,\n\n209\n00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,935\nthey've got 20 different updates that\nhave been released for that printer.\n\n210\n00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:46,205\nAnd if you install the newest one,\nit solves all the problems.\n\n211\n00:10:46,205 --> 00:10:47,155\nBut people overlook that.\n\n212\n00:10:47,155 --> 00:10:47,895\nThey don't think about it.\n\n213\n00:10:47,895 --> 00:10:51,125\nThey think about the software they use,\nnot necessarily the underlying hardware.\n\n214\n00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:55,040\nYou see that in laptops too, where all the\nhardware is integrated into the laptops.\n\n215\n00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,450\nDell, they put out tons\nof laptop driver updates.\n\n216\n00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,900\nSo it is one that's easy to overlook, but\n\n217\n00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,930\njust as important as\nthe operating systems.\n\n218\n00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,230\n>> Absolutely,\neven the IT guys can miss this one.\n\n219\n00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:09,330\nThey go and they'll re-image a system,\nand if their image itself is older,\n\n220\n00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,500\nyou might have gone through and\ndone some driver updates.\n\n221\n00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,780\nAnd then they have to reimage your machine\nfor some reason and all of a sudden,\n\n222\n00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,840\nyour video card is back to that\nsame old problem you had, or\n\n223\n00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,800\nthat printer is no longer working.\n\n224\n00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,050\nCuz once they wiped it and put that new\nimage of that operating system on there,\n\n225\n00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,720\nyou've got to go get all\nthose drivers again.\n\n226\n00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,910\nIf you have to have a rollback in time,\nif you're using checkpoints or\n\n227\n00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,038\nSystem Restore on a Windows machine, and\n\n228\n00:11:33,038 --> 00:11:37,270\nthen I go too far back in time,\nI can go back to before I did that update.\n\n229\n00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,020\nNow I have to go get those drivers again.\n\n230\n00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,570\nSo lots of different updates,\n\n231\n00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:44,330\ndifferent categories of updates\nthat we've got to deal with.\n\n232\n00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,410\nLet's talk a little bit about how\nwe go about getting these updates.\n\n233\n00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,802\nAnd the first one, Don, we're talking\nabout just manually going and\n\n234\n00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:54,170\nupdating your device or\nyour operating system.\n\n235\n00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,640\nMost of our vendors, they maintain\na website, and I can go to that website.\n\n236\n00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,000\nAnd I can find my product, and\nI can see if there's anything available.\n\n237\n00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,500\nIn fact,\nwe want to throw up my screen here.\n\n238\n00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,960\nI can give you a peek at that.\n\n239\n00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:11,451\nFor example, if I go to Dell, right,\nhere I've gone to Dell's web page.\n\n240\n00:12:11,451 --> 00:12:15,508\nAnd I've logged in, cuz I've got a few\nsystems that I already logged or\n\n241\n00:12:15,508 --> 00:12:17,790\nconfigured in the web page here.\n\n242\n00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,210\nSo I can pick one of these products.\n\n243\n00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,530\nHere's my little XPS laptop that I've got.\n\n244\n00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,391\nAnd again, it's gonna bring me to\nanother page, slowly but surely.\n\n245\n00:12:28,391 --> 00:12:31,951\nAnd I have a link here for\nDrivers & downloads.\n\n246\n00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,240\nSo I can take a look at that.\n\n247\n00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,780\nAnd again,\neventually it's gonna show me a list.\n\n248\n00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,730\nAnd I can come down here, and I've got\nsome different options I can go through.\n\n249\n00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,910\nBut I can see that there's an update for\nmy audio driver.\n\n250\n00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:51,211\nSo I can go ahead and choose to download\nthat file and install that file.\n\n251\n00:12:51,211 --> 00:12:53,820\nSo this would be a very manual method.\n\n252\n00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,690\nThey also have the option on\nhere to scan your system.\n\n253\n00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,900\nSome of these websites now will\ninstall a little agent on your system.\n\n254\n00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,031\nAnd it can detect,\n\n255\n00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:04,860\nI might not know exactly what\nsound card I've got in the system.\n\n256\n00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,085\nMaybe I bought it used, maybe it\nwas issued to me by my company, and\n\n257\n00:13:08,085 --> 00:13:10,750\nI didn't get to pick and\nchoose the different pieces.\n\n258\n00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:16,490\nSo there are autodetect capabilities\nin some of these as well, all right.\n\n259\n00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,690\nIf I flip over to this other tab,\nthis is where I've gone to Linksys.\n\n260\n00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,600\nAnd here I could do a firmware upgrade on,\nsay, my router at the house.\n\n261\n00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,530\nSo I can come in here and\nI can View Product List.\n\n262\n00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,470\nAnd I could find the product\nthat I'm looking for.\n\n263\n00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,130\nWell, we'll just take this wireless-N\nrouter here for an example.\n\n264\n00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,210\nAnd then it's gonna take me over to,\nhopefully there we go,\n\n265\n00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:41,950\na little screen where I can see downloads,\nand I can choose to download software.\n\n266\n00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,680\nAnd then if there's any new firmware for\nthis device, it'll be listed here.\n\n267\n00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,170\nSo if I take a look, in fact\nthere's a a few different versions.\n\n268\n00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,880\nSo I might need to look on\nthe bottom of my device and\n\n269\n00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,310\nsee if there's a version number.\n\n270\n00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,209\nLike here when they built these routers,\nthey had version 1, version 2, and\n\n271\n00:13:57,209 --> 00:13:58,091\nversion 2.1.\n\n272\n00:13:58,091 --> 00:14:01,686\nYou want to be really careful if\nyou're doing a firmware upgrade,\n\n273\n00:14:01,686 --> 00:14:05,080\nbecause this is stuff that's\non the chip on that device.\n\n274\n00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,070\nAnd you can end up doing what\nthey call bricking the device,\n\n275\n00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:12,970\nright, you're actually going to write to\nthat chip and then reboot that system.\n\n276\n00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:13,900\nAnd if you goof that up,\n\n277\n00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,530\nif you pick the wrong one, you can\nend up making that device unusable.\n\n278\n00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:21,060\nSo you do want to be careful when\nyou're doing these firmware upgrades.\n\n279\n00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,540\nBut very important, they can actually\nprovide additional functionality and\n\n280\n00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,280\nfix problems in those devices as well.\n\n281\n00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,950\n>> So what Mike's been showing here so\nfar is a manual update.\n\n282\n00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,031\nRight, he's manually going to\nthese websites and checking.\n\n283\n00:14:35,031 --> 00:14:38,562\nAnd that's somewhat unfortunate because\nthere might be updates out for your\n\n284\n00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:42,431\nrouter, for your printer, for your video\ncard, and you don't even know about it.\n\n285\n00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,490\nYou have to go and find out.\n\n286\n00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,528\nSo any time they give you an agent\nto automatically do the update,\n\n287\n00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:48,130\nthat helps out a lot.\n\n288\n00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,808\nNow, in our operating systems, so\nif you're running Windows or Mac OS or\n\n289\n00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:57,711\nLinux, those guys get so many updates\nthat all the major vendors have given us\n\n290\n00:14:57,711 --> 00:14:59,691\na way to do automatic updates.\n\n291\n00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,891\nSo that we can set it and\njust kind of not have to worry about.\n\n292\n00:15:02,891 --> 00:15:05,411\nAgain, your system will\nautomatically update on its own.\n\n293\n00:15:05,411 --> 00:15:06,431\nAnd the cool part is,\n\n294\n00:15:06,431 --> 00:15:10,460\nthey'll typically do it at night\nwhen you're not using the computer.\n\n295\n00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,720\nSo then your computer stays up to date,\nwithout really inconveniencing you and\n\n296\n00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,940\ndisrupting your normal workflows and\nso on.\n\n297\n00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,840\nI made a joke at\nthe beginning of the episode.\n\n298\n00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,495\nIt seems like it's always\ndisrupting me for whatever reason.\n\n299\n00:15:21,495 --> 00:15:22,611\n>> Java.\n>> I'm in a hurry,\n\n300\n00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:24,620\nI'm trying to shut my computer down.\n\n301\n00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,630\nIt's like 77 updates applying,\nwell, wonderful.\n\n302\n00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:32,010\nSo that does happen, but\nthe trade-off is not doing the updates.\n\n303\n00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,490\nAnd then you're leaving\nyourself vulnerable.\n\n304\n00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,610\nSo Mike, you want to show\nthem some automatic updates?\n\n305\n00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,840\n>> Absolutely,\nI'm gonna pull up my Windows box here.\n\n306\n00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,830\nAnd what I'm going to do,\nswitch over to my Start screen.\n\n307\n00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,465\nAnd this is Windows 8.1, so\n\n308\n00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:46,520\nit's gonna be slightly different\nin different versions of your OS.\n\n309\n00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,668\nYou'll have to to find out\nwhere the settings are.\n\n310\n00:15:48,668 --> 00:15:54,613\nIn Windows 8.1, I'm gonna click\non Settings > Change PC settings.\n\n311\n00:15:54,613 --> 00:15:59,086\nAnd at the very bottom of this list\nover here I've got Update and Recovery,\n\n312\n00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:00,223\nso I click on that.\n\n313\n00:16:00,223 --> 00:16:01,503\nAnd there's my Windows Update.\n\n314\n00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,703\nNow, I could,\nmine is set to automatically scan.\n\n315\n00:16:04,703 --> 00:16:08,522\nEvery night at 3:00 in the morning my\nsystem reaches out to Microsoft to find\n\n316\n00:16:08,522 --> 00:16:10,175\nout if there's any new updates for\n\n317\n00:16:10,175 --> 00:16:13,065\nthis particular version\nof the operating system.\n\n318\n00:16:13,065 --> 00:16:17,395\nAnd I can see that it says, there aren't\nany updates that download automatically.\n\n319\n00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:18,525\nI could click Check now.\n\n320\n00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:20,725\nI could go ahead and say,\nyou know what, I don't trust it or\n\n321\n00:16:20,725 --> 00:16:24,385\nI just wanna see and I could go ahead and\nclick Check now and it would go out there.\n\n322\n00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:27,705\nI'm not gonna do that, it would take\na little too long for our show.\n\n323\n00:16:27,705 --> 00:16:31,850\nBut I am gonna click View details because\nI know that I'm setting my machine\n\n324\n00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,540\nto only get the critical\nupdates automatically.\n\n325\n00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,950\nAll of the optional updates, Microsoft\nclassifies their updates as either\n\n326\n00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,450\ncritical, the security related ones,\nor optional.\n\n327\n00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:46,065\nOptionals, might be things like\nmy touchpad or my touch screen or\n\n328\n00:16:46,065 --> 00:16:49,975\nsomething like that where if I use\nthe touch pad it could be very important\n\n329\n00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,215\nto me, if I don't use the touch pad,\nnot so important.\n\n330\n00:16:52,215 --> 00:16:55,705\nSo they're saying that it's optional, you\nreally don't have to worry about it and\n\n331\n00:16:55,705 --> 00:17:00,592\nin fact I can see here that I I have\none optional update for Silverlight.\n\n332\n00:17:00,592 --> 00:17:02,882\nYay, cuz everybody, Don likes Silverlight.\n\n333\n00:17:02,882 --> 00:17:03,723\n>> Oh, it's so important.\n\n334\n00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:04,550\n>> [LAUGH] It is.\n\n335\n00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,962\nSo I'm gonna go, just to show you guys,\nI'll kill my machine and\n\n336\n00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:09,162\ninstall Silverlight here.\n\n337\n00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,730\nSo I'm gonna select that update and\nclick Install.\n\n338\n00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,150\nWe don't have to wait for it,\nI'll accept my EULA here.\n\n339\n00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,810\nAnd now it's gonna download and\nupdate my machine.\n\n340\n00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:24,140\nNow, the one thing I do wanna show you\nhere is choose how updates get installed.\n\n341\n00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,620\nAnd this is where I've set it to\nInstall updates automatically.\n\n342\n00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,310\nAnd if I hit my drop down list I can\nsee I've got some other options.\n\n343\n00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:36,340\nI can come in here and choose, hey,\ndownload them, but don't install them.\n\n344\n00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,360\nI'll let you know when I'm\nready to install them.\n\n345\n00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,140\nOr I could say, hey, go check and see if\nthey're there, but don't download them or\n\n346\n00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,000\ninstall them.\n\n347\n00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,230\nI'll decide when to download them,\nI'll decide when to install them.\n\n348\n00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,660\nOr I could tell it to never check and\n\n349\n00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,800\nobviously that is a not\nrecommended option.\n\n350\n00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,990\nAnd that's because it goes back to\nwhat we were talking about earlier.\n\n351\n00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,900\nYou might think, Oh, I don't want to\ndo it automatically, it's in my way,\n\n352\n00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,235\nit's very inconvenient, but\nthe problem is, we forget, right.\n\n353\n00:18:01,235 --> 00:18:03,775\nAnd then we go weeks without\ngetting our updates, and\n\n354\n00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:08,565\nthere's security related updates are\navailable that we should have and there's\n\n355\n00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:12,927\nno reason, the only reason we don't\nhave them is cuz we forgot to go check.\n\n356\n00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:16,417\nI can also see it gave me the recommended\nupdates the same way I received important\n\n357\n00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:19,147\nupdates, which I could've\nsworn I unchecked, because I\n\n358\n00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:22,747\ndon't want their recommended updates\nthe way I get the important updates.\n\n359\n00:18:22,747 --> 00:18:25,988\nAnd then Microsoft has other\nproducts I can obtain updates for,\n\n360\n00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:27,528\nthrough their same systems.\n\n361\n00:18:27,528 --> 00:18:30,618\nSo instead of having to go to two\ndifferent places, I can get updates for\n\n362\n00:18:30,618 --> 00:18:35,928\nOffice and Internet Explorer, as well\nas the operating system through here.\n\n363\n00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:39,478\nSo that's how I can set that up and\nonce I've set it up, and that's it.\n\n364\n00:18:39,478 --> 00:18:40,028\nI really don't know.\n\n365\n00:18:40,028 --> 00:18:44,038\nIf I choose the option install and\ndownload automatically, I'm done.\n\n366\n00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:47,148\nEvery night at 3 o'clock,\nit goes out, it downloads them and\n\n367\n00:18:47,148 --> 00:18:50,760\nit schedules the install, usually picks\nan inopportune time to do it, but\n\n368\n00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,610\nthat's just one of the evils\nof the whole system.\n\n369\n00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,730\nSo that's an example on a Windows machine,\nand then Don,\n\n370\n00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,990\nyou've got an example on\na Mac operating system?\n\n371\n00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,550\n>> Sure.\n\n372\n00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,280\nYou know, in Mac OS,\nthe newer versions of Mac OS,\n\n373\n00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,180\nthey just use the Apple App Store\nto do their updates.\n\n374\n00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,600\nSo here I am in\nthe Apple App Store on my system.\n\n375\n00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,890\nAnd you'll see, right up here at the top,\nit's already checking for me,\n\n376\n00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:10,980\nit's got Updates 1.\n\n377\n00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,190\nI can see there's an update for something.\n\n378\n00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,030\nNow, the cool thing\nabout the App Store is,\n\n379\n00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:20,000\nit'll do updates to the operating system,\nso Mac OS, as well as any apps,\n\n380\n00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,230\nwhether they're Apple or not, as long as\nthey were installed through the App Store.\n\n381\n00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,150\nSo I don't have any updates available for\nmy Mac itself.\n\n382\n00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,130\nYou see down here,\nthese are all updates for\n\n383\n00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,730\nmy Mac itself that were all\ninstalled in the last 30 days.\n\n384\n00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,500\nSafari, Remote Desktop Client,\nYosemite, right?\n\n385\n00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,210\nThose are big updates that came through,\nit's already applied those.\n\n386\n00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,570\nBut I've got an update right now for\nthe Microsoft Remote Desktop client that I\n\n387\n00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:45,590\ninstalled from the App Store and so\nit's gonna see that and apply that update.\n\n388\n00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,100\nNow, we can do it manually,\nlike I'm doing right here.\n\n389\n00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,960\nYou come to the App Store,\nyou hit Update All, it's gonna do it or\n\n390\n00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,670\nwe can do it automatically and\nthat's how mine is normally set,\n\n391\n00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,180\nthat these'll just come in and\nautomatically update.\n\n392\n00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,730\nIf I go into my System Preferences and\nI go into my App Store settings,\n\n393\n00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,860\nyou'll see the option right here,\nAutomatically check for\n\n394\n00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,410\nupdates and Install app updates,\nInstall OS X updates, right.\n\n395\n00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:11,370\nWe kind of pick and choose those\noptions based on what we want and\n\n396\n00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:15,170\nif we choose to be automatic, then this\nscreen here will automatically go and\n\n397\n00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,660\ndo updates, and now we're up to date.\n\n398\n00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,670\nRight?\nI've got that nice little\n\n399\n00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,450\nMicrosoft Remote Desktop installed.\n\n400\n00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,990\nIt's done, I'm up to date,\nthe system is free and clear.\n\n401\n00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,020\nWith Apple systems, it's really important\nyou do these updates, because on an Apple\n\n402\n00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,600\nsystem, we don't normally install\nantivirus or anti-malware software, right,\n\n403\n00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,940\nbecause there's no viruses for Mac,\nwhich is not a true statement.\n\n404\n00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,020\nBut there are viruses for Mac, and\n\n405\n00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,340\nthere is malware for Mac but\nApple is really proactive about it.\n\n406\n00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,290\nThey push out updates to protect it,\nso you don't have to worry about it.\n\n407\n00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,090\nThat's why we don't need anti virus or\n\n408\n00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:50,240\nanti malware on these systems,\nas long as we do our updates, right?\n\n409\n00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,900\nIf I don't do my updates,\nthen how can Apple protect me?\n\n410\n00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,050\nAnd if Apple's not protecting me,\n\n411\n00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,950\nthen I'm vulnerable to get those\ninfections just like any other system.\n\n412\n00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:02,160\nSo there is a bit of a myth out there\nabout how Macs you don't need antivirus,\n\n413\n00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,150\nyou don't need anti-malware,\nand you don't worry about them.\n\n414\n00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,340\nBut you do need to worry about that,\n\n415\n00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,970\nyou at least need to enable your auto\nupdates to let Apple do their job and\n\n416\n00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,510\nhelp to make sure it's not\nsomething you have to worry about.\n\n417\n00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,000\nAutomatic updates are important.\n\n418\n00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,460\nSame thing under Linux systems,\n\n419\n00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,220\nlike if you're running Debian or\nUbuntu systems which are pretty common.\n\n420\n00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,360\nThey have, it's called Aptitude,\n\n421\n00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,540\na little software update manager they run,\nsent to us.\n\n422\n00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,230\nRed Hat, they all have them too and\nthey just run in the background.\n\n423\n00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,720\nThey automatically do the updates.\n\n424\n00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,320\nThere is very, very little\nreason to turn that off, right?\n\n425\n00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,770\nYou might have some software, that gets\naffected by an update and stops working,\n\n426\n00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:41,840\nso you might wanna do a little bit of\ntesting before you roll an update out, but\n\n427\n00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,700\ntypically there's no reason\nto not apply an update.\n\n428\n00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,810\n>> Yeah.\nDon't be fooled in the whole your system\n\n429\n00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,730\nis gonna run so\nmuch better if you stop the updates.\n\n430\n00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:53,040\nPeople will tell you if you turn that off\nit'll be much better on your computer,\n\n431\n00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,889\ncuz it's, it's going out and checking\nall the time [INAUDIBLE] and it's not.\n\n432\n00:21:56,889 --> 00:22:00,660\nNow different applications on your system\nmight be checking at different times,\n\n433\n00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,210\nbut it's not like Microsoft for\nexample those windows updates,\n\n434\n00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,532\nit's not taking every hour,\nit's once a night.\n\n435\n00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,270\nYou know.\n\n436\n00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,230\nJava is a little bit over the top.\n\n437\n00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,510\nIt seems to always have\nan update available, and\n\n438\n00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:15,210\nyou can turn the automatic updates off,\nand somehow it gets turned back on and\n\n439\n00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,250\nit tells you, hey,\nthere's an update available.\n\n440\n00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,920\nOr it wants to check for updates,\nbut don't be fooled in that,\n\n441\n00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,900\ndon't turn those off,\nadjust your settings.\n\n442\n00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,130\nRight?\nIf you don't want the optional updates,\n\n443\n00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,050\nif you wanna avoid some of those,\nfine, turn those off, but\n\n444\n00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:30,100\nlet it automatically get those\nsecurity related updates.\n\n445\n00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,300\nAnd in some situations you might\nnot be able to turn it off.\n\n446\n00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,400\nIf you go and look at those settings\nthat we're showing you here,\n\n447\n00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,150\nlike in a corporate environment.\n\n448\n00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:41,380\nYour system might not be going out\nto say Microsoft to get the updates.\n\n449\n00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:46,640\nCompanies now will run their own local\nupdate server and it works the same way.\n\n450\n00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,890\nYour computer's still gonna go out,\nin a Microsoft world for example,\n\n451\n00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:53,140\nyour computer's still gonna go out in the\nmiddle of the night and check for updates.\n\n452\n00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,230\nBut instead of going out to Microsoft\nit's actually going to go to a server run\n\n453\n00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,190\nby your IT department there in house or\nsomewhere on your corporate network.\n\n454\n00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,260\nAnd the reason they do this is because,\n\n455\n00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,980\nas Don was saying, sometimes\nthese updates can cause problems.\n\n456\n00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,254\nIn our home systems, it's usually not that\nbig of a deal, but when I've got 500,\n\n457\n00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:15,910\na thousand or a hundred thousand clients\nto support, if I have enough data comes\n\n458\n00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:20,120\nout that clashes with one of our custom\npieces of software, and all of a sudden\n\n459\n00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,410\nI've got 5,000 machines that are unusable\nand I've gotta fix it, that's a big deal.\n\n460\n00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:27,400\nSo I don't want them going\nout directly to Microsoft and\n\n461\n00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,140\ngetting every update available.\n\n462\n00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,220\nAs in a company,\nI wanna be able to test those updates so\n\n463\n00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,470\nthat I can make sure they're\nnot gonna cause a problem,\n\n464\n00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,070\non a small subgroup of computers, and then\nonce I'm sure they're not going to cause\n\n465\n00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:41,110\na problem then I can deploy them\nout to the rest of the network.\n\n466\n00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,830\nSo if you're on your system and\nyou look at your update settings and\n\n467\n00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:47,870\nit won't let you change them, if it says\nno control by the system administrator or\n\n468\n00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,145\nsomething like that.\n\n469\n00:23:49,145 --> 00:23:49,665\nDon't panic.\n\n470\n00:23:49,665 --> 00:23:54,235\nThat probably means your company is\nusing an in-house update server so\n\n471\n00:23:54,235 --> 00:23:57,645\nthat it'll give them a little more\ncontrol over that update process\n\n472\n00:23:59,265 --> 00:24:00,795\n>> And that's an important thing,\n\n473\n00:24:00,795 --> 00:24:05,205\nbecause there are times where\nupdates do conflict with software,\n\n474\n00:24:05,205 --> 00:24:07,000\nwhere you've got to do some testing.\n\n475\n00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,730\nBut, I mean you've really\ngot to have a team.\n\n476\n00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,720\nYou have to have staff that's dedicated\nthat to make sure the updates do go out,\n\n477\n00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,780\nyou definitely don't\nwant to miss an update.\n\n478\n00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,980\n>> Exactly.\n\n479\n00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,660\nSo, Don, I think that kind of covers\nour updates from top to bottom.\n\n480\n00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,430\nIs there anything else we need to?\n\n481\n00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,160\n>> No, that's it.\nYou know,\n\n482\n00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,450\nthe moral of the story is,\nupdate and update often, right.\n\n483\n00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,010\nMake sure you do those,\nit is really important.\n\n484\n00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,860\nDon't push them off, a lot of people do,\nand it's a big mistake.\n\n485\n00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,550\nSo definitely do that.\n\n486\n00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,240\nAnd if you're having problems on your\ncomputer, one of the first troubleshooting\n\n487\n00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,780\nsteps you should take is to apply\nwhatever updates are available.\n\n488\n00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,580\nSo your network's not working right?\n\n489\n00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,260\nGo see if there's an update for\nyour network card driver.\n\n490\n00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,960\nSee if there's an update for your router.\n\n491\n00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,800\nAnd a lot of times those'll fix your\nproblems and save you a tech support\n\n492\n00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,000\ncall or an expensive visit from\na tech to your home or wherever.\n\n493\n00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,940\n>> So absolutely.\n\n494\n00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,950\n>> Definitely make sure you do that.\n\n495\n00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,890\nAll right so this episode we got a chance\nto talk about updates, what they are,\n\n496\n00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,030\nseeing how they apply,\nand all that good stuff,\n\n497\n00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,110\nreally important information to have.\n\n498\n00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,990\nWe hope you guys enjoyed the episode.\n\n499\n00:25:01,990 -->

to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,385\nI'll be your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:16,385 --> 00:00:18,475\nAnd here with me today is my\ngood friend Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:19,385\nHow are you doing today, Mike?\n\n7\n00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:20,735\n>> I'm doing fantastic, Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:21,655\nGlad to be here.\n\n9\n00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:25,610\nWe got another exciting episode of our\nsecurity fundamentals coming your way.\n\n10\n00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,600\nIn this episode,\nwe're gonna be talking about backup.\n\n11\n00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,330\nSo we're not talking about\nputting your car in reverse here,\n\n12\n00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,500\nwe're talking about keeping\nyour data safe, right?\n\n13\n00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,130\nMaking sure that we have a good\nbackup of all those files,\n\n14\n00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,540\nall those important things\non our computer, right?\n\n15\n00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,990\nNow at a corporate level,\nin the enterprise level,\n\n16\n00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,640\nwe've got IT people that are taking care\nof our file servers and things like that.\n\n17\n00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,500\nAnd usually at a workplace, we're told to\nstore all of our important information\n\n18\n00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,020\nup there on those files servers.\n\n19\n00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,730\nThat way, if anything ever happens,\nwe know they're taking care of it.\n\n20\n00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,360\nThey're getting a good backup.\n\n21\n00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,410\nBut there's still some stuff on my\nPC that I might want to keep safe,\n\n22\n00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,850\nespecially if I'm using\nmy own computer at work,\n\n23\n00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:07,660\nif we're doing the old\nBring Your Own Device type thing.\n\n24\n00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,500\nOr if I travel with that work network,\n\n25\n00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,780\nit's disconnected from\nthe corporate network.\n\n26\n00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,850\nAnd I'm out there making sales and\nthings like that.\n\n27\n00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,260\nAnd there's things that are on my computer\nthat aren't being sent up to that file\n\n28\n00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,260\nserver and they're not being backed up.\n\n29\n00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,630\nSo I need to try to keep those safe.\n\n30\n00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,610\nAnd the first I guess\nwe need talk about is,\n\n31\n00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,180\nwhy we need a backup in the first place?\n\n32\n00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,620\nAnd there's all kinds of things that\ncan go wrong with our data, right?\n\n33\n00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,599\n>> Oh yes, this is the tried and true.\n\n34\n00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:36,548\nSomeone will call the help desk,\nI've worked on helpdesk stuff before and\n\n35\n00:01:36,548 --> 00:01:40,360\nthey say, I'm missing a file or\nI accidentally deleted the file.\n\n36\n00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,080\nWhat are we going to do?\n\n37\n00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,280\nWell I say oh, well that's not a problem.\n\n38\n00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,350\nLet's get it from the backup.\n\n39\n00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,949\nWhere do you backup your files to?\n\n40\n00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:50,186\nWell and you're like,\nnow you understand the purpose of why\n\n41\n00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:57,517\nwe strongly emphasize why it's such a good\nidea to actually back up your files.\n\n42\n00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:02,957\nThere's plenty of ways for it to be done,\nit's just that you have to actually do it.\n\n43\n00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:06,357\nIf you don't take advantage of it,\nwhen that critical time comes,\n\n44\n00:02:06,357 --> 00:02:10,280\nnot if, but when that critical time comes,\n\n45\n00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,280\nif you don't have it, well you're kinda\nup a river without a paddle, right?\n\n46\n00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,610\nIt's just how it's gonna\nwork at that point in time.\n\n47\n00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,620\n>> It's Murphy's Law.\n\n48\n00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,110\nIt's gonna happen when you really\ndon't need it to happen, right?\n\n49\n00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,810\nYou could do like Daniel said,\nyou might accidentally delete a file.\n\n50\n00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,250\nMaybe make some changes to a file and\nyou wipe out half of it and you save it.\n\n51\n00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,050\nAnd you go back to that\noriginal version of that file.\n\n52\n00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,190\nYou could have a hard drive fail,\nyou could have an operating system crash,\n\n53\n00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,190\nyou could get malware on your computer and\nyour I.T. department might just come by\n\n54\n00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,580\nand say, you know what,\nwe're just gonna reimage your machine.\n\n55\n00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,140\nAnd so this slap a new installation\nof your operating system on there.\n\n56\n00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,320\nThey're go, there you go,\nback to work for you.\n\n57\n00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,800\nWhere is all my stuff?\n\n58\n00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,219\nDidn't you back it up?\n\n59\n00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:51,470\nNo.\n\n60\n00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,730\nAnd now it's gone.\n\n61\n00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,440\nSo we need to make sure\nthat we're doing backups.\n\n62\n00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,830\nWe have to think about the data that\nwe're storing on our computers.\n\n63\n00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,840\nAnd whether or not it's being\nprotected because things go wrong,\n\n64\n00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,580\ncomputers fail, hardware fails,\nwe get viruses,\n\n65\n00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,470\nwe get bad guys that hack in and\nsteal things, or corrupt things.\n\n66\n00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,500\nSo that's the whole idea\nbehind backing things up is\n\n67\n00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,450\nmaking another copy of a it, right?\n\n68\n00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,650\nHaving another copy somewhere else,\n\n69\n00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:22,000\nso that if something happens to the\noriginal, I have a way to replace that.\n\n70\n00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,900\nNow how often you know, or\n\n71\n00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,710\nhow many changes we lose would depend on\nhow often you're taking those backups?\n\n72\n00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,820\nIn this show we're not really\ngonna dive into the nitty gritty\n\n73\n00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,970\ntechnical details of the back up,\nI'll give you a little background,\n\n74\n00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,170\nwhen we do backups we can do\ndifferent types of backups.\n\n75\n00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,480\nThere's what we call a full backup,\nwhich backs up everything.\n\n76\n00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,060\nThose are gonna take\na little longer to run.\n\n77\n00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,230\nThey're also gonna require\nthe most storage space.\n\n78\n00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:51,120\nAnd then we can do what we\ncall incremental backups.\n\n79\n00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,330\nThat only back up changes\nsince the last backup.\n\n80\n00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,260\nThere's incremental, there's differential.\n\n81\n00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,110\nThey work slightly differently, but\n\n82\n00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:04,400\nthey're basically up the changes since the\nlast full backup or the last incremental.\n\n83\n00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,000\nLike I say,\nwe're not gonna get into the details.\n\n84\n00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,860\nThe point is those differentials and\nincrementals, don't take as long,\n\n85\n00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,330\nbecause they don't have to back up\nthe things that haven't changed, right?\n\n86\n00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,730\nSo they're a little bit\nquicker to perform.\n\n87\n00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,400\nBut then when it comes time to restore,\nI'm going to need that full backup and\n\n88\n00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,480\none of those differentials or\nall of those incrementals.\n\n89\n00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,340\nBut anyway, like I said that's really,\n\n90\n00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,540\nwe'll talk about that in little later,\nin another episode.\n\n91\n00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,160\nFor now, we just want to understand that\nbacking up is making a copy of that data.\n\n92\n00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,240\nWhen we look at where we back things up\nto, we've got a lot of different choices.\n\n93\n00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,680\nOn my PC for example, I've only\ngot a single hard drive in there.\n\n94\n00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,690\nIf you've got a machine that\nhas more than one hard drive,\n\n95\n00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:51,230\nyou could back up data from one\ndrive onto that other drive.\n\n96\n00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:56,950\nBut you wanna make sure you understand if\nyou've got two physical disks in there or\n\n97\n00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,110\nif it's one disk divided\nup into two letters.\n\n98\n00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,370\nSometimes when you go to Windows Explorer\nand you'll see C colon and\n\n99\n00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,660\nyou'll see D colon, and you might assume\nthat that's two separate hard drives.\n\n100\n00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,150\nMight not be the case, right?\n\n101\n00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,290\n>> Yeah, it's not always the case.\n\n102\n00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,690\nYou really need to check\nthat removable storage area,\n\n103\n00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,580\nor storage area under\nthe My Computer section, or\n\n104\n00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,430\ncomputer section of your\nMicrosoft operating system.\n\n105\n00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,390\nThat's gonna let you\nknow whether you have, or\n\n106\n00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,570\nwhether it's seeing more than\none type of storage media.\n\n107\n00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,810\nNow you don't wanna get confused and see\nthat D drive, it's probably a CD-ROM or\n\n108\n00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,240\nDVD drive.\n\n109\n00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,030\nUsually the case, not always,\nbut if you go there,\n\n110\n00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,720\nyou check that computer properties area,\nyou're gonna see what's what and\n\n111\n00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,130\nhave that removable storage\nsection to make sure there\n\n112\n00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,550\nis an actual other drive letter\nthat's seeing some space.\n\n113\n00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,270\nBecause what this really boils down to,\nis having multiple points of failure.\n\n114\n00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,020\nYou don't ever really want to\nhave a single point of failure.\n\n115\n00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,730\nBecause, well,\nit's kind of self-explanatory.\n\n116\n00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,480\nIf I have one device and\nit fails, well, then I'm done.\n\n117\n00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,160\nI'm toast.\n\n118\n00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,480\nEverything's gone.\n\n119\n00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,460\nIf I have two devices that have\nthe same information on them.\n\n120\n00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,910\nWell, one can die and\nI'm still in the game.\n\n121\n00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,640\nI'm not completely done.\n\n122\n00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,990\nAll I have to do is replace\nthe one that died and\n\n123\n00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,750\nthen use my backup software or whatever\nit is I did to take that information.\n\n124\n00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,480\nMaybe I'm just copying the files from from\none hard drive to the other manually.\n\n125\n00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,480\nThat is a valid form of backup.\n\n126\n00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,250\nIt's a long and drawn out process, but\nyou can do it, and it is legitimate, and\n\n127\n00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,720\nyou will be backing that up.\n\n128\n00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,870\nAnd whatever case or\n\n129\n00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,870\nhow you're doing it, make sure that you\nhave that multiple point of failure, so\n\n130\n00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,680\nthat you don't get caught out in the weeds\nlike that when something bad goes wrong.\n\n131\n00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,430\n>> Exactly.\nNow, most of these programs won't let you\n\n132\n00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,760\nback up data to the same drive, and if you\nthink about it, it would be kind of silly.\n\n133\n00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,980\nIf I'm going to back up my data,\nthat's on my, say,\n\n134\n00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:54,610\nC drive, and I'm going to store\nthat backup on my C drive.\n\n135\n00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:59,920\nWell if I lose the C drive, I've lost\nmy data and I've lost my backup, right?\n\n136\n00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,940\nSo that's what I'm saying.\n\n137\n00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,850\nYou got to have more than one drive and\nmake sure that they're not on the same,\n\n138\n00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,270\nbut most of them won't let you do that.\n\n139\n00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,148\nAnother good option as you said, you can\nback up to some type of removable media.\n\n140\n00:07:10,148 --> 00:07:13,770\nDVDs or CD-roms if they're writable.\n\n141\n00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,910\nOnly downside of those guys is that\ncapacity is not that great and\n\n142\n00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,030\nthe speed is not going to be that great.\n\n143\n00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,320\nBut if you're on your home PC and you just\nwant to make sure you've got a good backup\n\n144\n00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,820\nof all your photos, well maybe you just\nlike Daniel says, copy them over that DVD\n\n145\n00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,410\nand then you throw the DVD in a case and\nyou throw it in your bookshelf somewhere.\n\n146\n00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,580\nNow that's a valid back up, that's\nwhat we call an unstructured back up.\n\n147\n00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,380\nYou're just backing up random information,\nnot random, but\n\n148\n00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,800\nyou're choosing what you want to back up,\nyou're putting on the DVD.\n\n149\n00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,200\nWhen you have to restore, you have to go\nfind that DVD and you can copy it back.\n\n150\n00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,963\nAnother good option for\na desktop at work or\n\n151\n00:07:47,963 --> 00:07:53,052\nat a home computer would be those portable\ndrives that we have now, these USB.\n\n152\n00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:56,810\nBased hard drives, but\nevery computer has USB nowadays.\n\n153\n00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:02,030\nMost of them are up to that USB 3.0\nwhich is gonna give us very good speeds.\n\n154\n00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,160\nThe drives have incredible capacities\non them, they're not that expensive.\n\n155\n00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,430\nSo I can back up my entire machine to\none of these portable hard drives here.\n\n156\n00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,020\nI don't know if I can get\nit up into the screen.\n\n157\n00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,750\nThere you go, you can see this is one.\n\n158\n00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,520\nThis is a little Western Digital\nportable hard drive.\n\n159\n00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,820\nIt plugs in via USB into my computer, and\n\n160\n00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:25,970\nI can use that to back my system up, or\nto back up individual files as well.\n\n161\n00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,760\nAnd that's something that I can unplug.\n\n162\n00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,480\nI could take to another\nmachine if I needed to, or\n\n163\n00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,860\nI can set it up on a shelf somewhere.\n\n164\n00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,180\nIn my case, at home,\n\n165\n00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,430\nI've got one that's plugged into my\nhome computer that remains plugged in.\n\n166\n00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:41,340\nAnd in the background, it's constantly\nbacking up files over that drive.\n\n167\n00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,980\nNow, if that computer ever fails, I'll\nhave to do is fix my computer, plug this\n\n168\n00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,900\nUSB drive back into that new computer, and\nI can restore my data back onto there.\n\n169\n00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,020\nSo you got a few different\noptions that you can use, and\n\n170\n00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,760\nreally what we're looking for\nwhen we choose the media\n\n171\n00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,040\nthat we wanna do our backups to, whether\nwe're doing a backup with a program which\n\n172\n00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,010\nwe're going to talk about a minute, or\njust like Daniel said, copying files over.\n\n173\n00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,550\nIt's all about speed and capacity,\nhow long is it going to take me?\n\n174\n00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,420\nI know Daniel, you're a photographer, if\nyou had to copy all of your files over to\n\n175\n00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,420\na CD-ROM or DVD, one,\nhow many do you think it would take and\n\n176\n00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,410\nhow long do you think it would take,\nright?\n\n177\n00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:21,930\n>> That would be a very long and arduous\nprocess, and a lot of people are the same\n\n178\n00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,105\nway like even though I'm a photographer,\nmost people do take pictures and\n\n179\n00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:30,265\nstore them on their home computer or\nlaptop, desktop whatever the case may be.\n\n180\n00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:32,195\nThey may be even storing\nit on their work computer.\n\n181\n00:09:32,195 --> 00:09:35,855\nLike Mike said, sometimes you're doing\na bring your own device kind of deal and\n\n182\n00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:41,355\nyou're shilling that in and out of work,\nand using it as your main system.\n\n183\n00:09:41,355 --> 00:09:43,780\nWell if I wanna keep that stuff and\n\n184\n00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,310\nI don't want the tech guys to come\naround go today, we're upgrading and\n\n185\n00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,220\nwe're gonna blow your computer away,\nand I haven't backed that stuff up.\n\n186\n00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,580\nMy wife would kill me if all\nthe baby pictures were gone because\n\n187\n00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,050\nI didn't back the stuff up.\n\n188\n00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,310\nI wanna be as redundant as possible.\n\n189\n00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,800\nThings like what Mike\nwas showing you here.\n\n190\n00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,880\nThat terabyte drive,\nit's probably a terabyte.\n\n191\n00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,700\nThat's a lot of storage.\n\n192\n00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,730\nA terabyte for a home user.\n\n193\n00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,650\nEven for a desktop business user, someone,\nan end user, a secretary, whatever.\n\n194\n00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,920\nThat is a lot of storage for you,\nand they're like 50, 60 bucks.\n\n195\n00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,540\nThey're very cheap.\n\n196\n00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,990\nThat's US dollars, obviously, but\nvery cheap, very inexpensive, but fast.\n\n197\n00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,860\nA lot of space, and\nthat's what we're looking for.\n\n198\n00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,720\nI can back everything up on that.\n\n199\n00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,830\nI would probably want to\nschedule those jobs and\n\n200\n00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,370\nnot to go at it willy nilly\nbecause you'll never get to it.\n\n201\n00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,240\nThat's a poor backup plan.\n\n202\n00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is to say, you know,\n\n203\n00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,745\nnext, the fifth of never.\n\n204\n00:10:37,745 --> 00:10:39,470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna get in there and\n\n205\n00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,350\nback of those files.\n\n206\n00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:42,605\nBecause that's exactly\nwhen that'll happen.\n\n207\n00:10:42,605 --> 00:10:45,845\nYou do need to have some\nreally regimented schedule.\n\n208\n00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:46,415\n>> Exactly.\n\n209\n00:10:46,415 --> 00:10:46,945\nYou really do.\n\n210\n00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:50,105\nYou want to try to have something that's\nautomated, because if you try to do it on\n\n211\n00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:53,805\nyour own, like sometimes if I'm getting\nready to do something to my computer,\n\n212\n00:10:53,805 --> 00:10:56,220\nI might quickly copy some stuff off.\n\n213\n00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,380\nI kinda give me that\nunstructured back up there.\n\n214\n00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,880\nBut I definitely have, in the background\nnormally, something running every night.\n\n215\n00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,570\nOr every so\noften that's gonna take those back ups.\n\n216\n00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,050\nIn fact, what I'm gonna show\nyou here in just a second.\n\n217\n00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,800\nYou know when we talk about doing these\nback ups and how we go about doing them.\n\n218\n00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,520\nYou know, we can do what we call\na full system image, right?\n\n219\n00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,230\nWhere we take, I mentioned that full\nback up, that backs up everything.\n\n220\n00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,690\nAnd that's really good if my hard\ndrive fails, and I've got to replace\n\n221\n00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:27,870\nthe operating system, and\nthe applications, and all of that stuff.\n\n222\n00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,600\nNow I can, because I've got that\nfull backup, that system image.\n\n223\n00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,800\nAnd this is typically what the IT\nguys are doing with those servers and\n\n224\n00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,710\nthings like that.\n\n225\n00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,180\nThey're doing system images.\n\n226\n00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,562\nWhen they deploy out new computers,\nthey pop an image down on there.\n\n227\n00:11:41,562 --> 00:11:46,700\nFor us at the desktops level for\ncorporate workers, for\n\n228\n00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,040\nyour home people,\nyou might do a system image.\n\n229\n00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,460\nBut most likely you're more concerned with\nyour files themselves, your My Documents,\n\n230\n00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,340\nyour pictures, your music.\n\n231\n00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,650\nAnd there's lots of programs\nthat we can go out and\n\n232\n00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,650\nget, that would allow us to do this.\n\n233\n00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:04,950\nAs well as some that are built\ninto my operating system itself.\n\n234\n00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,920\nFor example,\nI'm gonna show you guys Windows here, so\n\n235\n00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,450\nwe can pull this up real quick.\n\n236\n00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,550\nWindows has changed recently, they used\nto have something called Windows backup,\n\n237\n00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,420\nwhich was a feature that you could turn\non, and it allowed you to do those\n\n238\n00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,300\nbackups, like that the full backup and\nthe differentials and the incrementals.\n\n239\n00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,900\nWell, Windows kind of changed gears with\nthis, because they said, you know what,\n\n240\n00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,030\nas an end user,\nI really don't need all of that.\n\n241\n00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,970\nI mean,\nwe're gonna simplify it a little bit.\n\n242\n00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,350\nThe IT guys can still do those kind\nof backups on their servers and\n\n243\n00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,230\nthings like that.\n\n244\n00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,170\nFrom the client perspective,\nwe're gonna simplify it and\n\n245\n00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,650\nthey have now have something\ncalled File history.\n\n246\n00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:47,540\nAnd what file history is, is a backup\nutility that you can turn on in Windows,\n\n247\n00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,140\nand you point it to some\nother storage location,\n\n248\n00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,250\nlike that little USB hard\ndrive that I just showed you.\n\n249\n00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,070\nIn fact, here I can, I'm gonna switch\nback over to this other screen.\n\n250\n00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:58,730\nIf I can find it.\n\n251\n00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,840\nMaybe that's the one.\n\n252\n00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,050\nAnyway, I can see that I turned\non file history this morning.\n\n253\n00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,050\nI want to make sure I\ncan show you guys this.\n\n254\n00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,340\nPlugged in my drive and I went into\nmy settings and I turned it on,\n\n255\n00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,920\nand I told it where I\nwanted to store that.\n\n256\n00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,930\nI looked at my computer, it looked\nat what drives I had available, and\n\n257\n00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,840\nit actually saw this one and\nrecommended that I use that one.\n\n258\n00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,600\nBecause this computer only\nhas a single drive in it, and\n\n259\n00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,590\nwhen that drive was unplugged, it wasn't\ngonna let me turn on File History.\n\n260\n00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,620\nAnd so there's no point in\nkeeping a copy of those files\n\n261\n00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,640\non the same drive, all right?\n\n262\n00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,710\nSo once I turned it on, what it does is\nit looks at My Library, where most people\n\n263\n00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:40,590\nstore their My Documents,\ntheir Pictures folder, their Music folder.\n\n264\n00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:45,380\nAnd it starts creating copies of those\nfiles and it takes it a step further,\n\n265\n00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,490\nit's really pretty cool.\n\n266\n00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,440\nWhat it's gonna do is it, not only\ndoes it make a copy of those files,\n\n267\n00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,200\nas I change files, it'll make copies of\nthem right before I make these changes.\n\n268\n00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,300\nSo it actually keeps a file history,\nhence the name file history.\n\n269\n00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,000\nAnd so if I want to go back to\na previous version of a file,\n\n270\n00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,670\nall I have to do is browse in here and\nfind that previous version.\n\n271\n00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,850\nAnd I'm gonna try to show you one thing,\nI'll flip back over to my Start screen.\n\n272\n00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,580\nAnd I'm just gonna type in file history,\nall right?\n\n273\n00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,999\nAnd I'm gonna pull up my file histories.\n\n274\n00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,910\nThere we go.\n\n275\n00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:27,160\nAnd I wanna show you the settings but\nanyway it's turned on.\n\n276\n00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,900\nI could turn it off.\n\n277\n00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,340\nI'm gonna click on my\nadvanced settings here and\n\n278\n00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,720\nsee if I can,\nthere's the screen I'm looking for.\n\n279\n00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,630\nSo once you turn it on, it's got some\ndefault settings and it's gonna, again,\n\n280\n00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,630\nlook at my library cuz that's where\nmost people store their stuff, and\n\n281\n00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,060\nit's gonna start making a copy\nof those files onto that drive.\n\n282\n00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:49,310\nAnd now, once it finishes making\nthat initial copy, from now on,\n\n283\n00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,560\nsave copies of files every hour.\n\n284\n00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,370\nSo every hour,\n\n285\n00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,280\nit's gonna look at my documents and\nit's going to see if they've changed.\n\n286\n00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,170\nif they've modified or\n\n287\n00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,310\nif they've been changed,\nit's going to make a copy of those guys.\n\n288\n00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:05,090\nI can also tell it how much space\nis available to store those, right?\n\n289\n00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:09,060\nBecause the more space I give it,\nthe more copies it can keep.\n\n290\n00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,860\nDoes it have just the last one or\ntwo versions of every file?\n\n291\n00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,990\nOr does it have the last\nten versions of every file?\n\n292\n00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,110\nWell it depends,\nit's on a first in first out basis,\n\n293\n00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,280\nso as new stuff gets copied,\nas I make changes to these documents,\n\n294\n00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,180\nit has to make room, so\nit gets rid of the older stuff.\n\n295\n00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,310\nSo the more space I give it,\nthe more versions it can keep.\n\n296\n00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,190\nAnd then it also tell me down here,\n\n297\n00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,390\nkeep saved versions as long\nas there's enough space.\n\n298\n00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,720\nHow long do I want to\nkeep those files for?\n\n299\n00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,490\nThe default is forever,\nbut I can change all this.\n\n300\n00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:44,750\nI can change how often it's gonna do\nthose backups, right, of those files.\n\n301\n00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,070\nIf I've got important documents, and\nI'm making a lot of changes to them.\n\n302\n00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,311\nMaybe I want to take more snapshots,\nor take a backup of these more often.\n\n303\n00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:54,015\nBecause at this point,\n\n304\n00:15:54,015 --> 00:15:59,724\nwith every hour I could lose up to 59\nminutes of work on a particular document,\n\n305\n00:15:59,724 --> 00:16:04,430\ncuz it took the last picture, or\nbackup, up to 59 minutes ago.\n\n306\n00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,280\nSo, anything I've done since then,\n\n307\n00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,420\nif I have to roll back to that point, I've\nlost all the work up until that point.\n\n308\n00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,290\nSo maybe I wanna change that,\nmaybe I wanna dedicate more space so\n\n309\n00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,580\nthat it can keep more\nversions of those files.\n\n310\n00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,892\nAnd maybe I don't want\nto keep them forever.\n\n311\n00:16:18,892 --> 00:16:23,270\nMaybe if it hasn't been changed in\na while, I can just purge it out of there.\n\n312\n00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,131\nSo that's Windows and\nthat's what they've changed.\n\n313\n00:16:27,131 --> 00:16:29,590\nLike I said,\nthey used to have Windows backup.\n\n314\n00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,880\nNow, in your client operating system it's\nall about what's called file history.\n\n315\n00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,670\nYou just point it to an external location\nor somewhere on your network that it can\n\n316\n00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:42,190\nstore a copy of these files and I can go\nback and restore them any time I need to.\n\n317\n00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:45,420\nNow once I've got these backups, I want\nto show you what it looks like here.\n\n318\n00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:47,910\nHopefully, there we go.\n\n319\n00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,140\nIn the event I need to restore something,\nI can browse back through here.\n\n320\n00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:58,010\nNow it hasn't taken a whole lot because\nI only enabled this a few hours ago and\n\n321\n00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,430\nit said to do it every hour.\n\n322\n00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,880\nSo I don't have a lot of versions,\n\n323\n00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,720\nbut you can see I can thumb\nthrough my different versions.\n\n324\n00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,210\nThis one was taken at 10 o'clock.\n\n325\n00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,370\nAnd then I disconnected the drive,\nso it probably didn't do one.\n\n326\n00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,560\nLet's see here, there's one at 8 o’clock.\n\n327\n00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,750\nI'm missing my 9 o’clock cuz I had\ndisconnected the drive temporarily.\n\n328\n00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,570\nBut you can see I can\nbrowse through here and\n\n329\n00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:21,730\nI can say look there's that file\nthat I accidentally deleted.\n\n330\n00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,300\nI need to get that back.\n\n331\n00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,810\nSo, I found the particular date and\ntime that has that file from\n\n332\n00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:30,450\nbefore I deleted it, and\nall I have to do is click on Restore.\n\n333\n00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,040\nAnd I can tell it,\ndo I want to put it back in the original?\n\n334\n00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,400\nIn most cases,\nthe original is not going to exist, right?\n\n335\n00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,550\nI'm just showing you a demo here.\n\n336\n00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,230\nSo, I'm just gonna tell it to\nreplace the file in the destination.\n\n337\n00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,600\nAnd there it goes,\nthat file is now back where it belongs.\n\n338\n00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,280\nAnd that's Microsoft's File History.\n\n339\n00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,230\nBut Microsoft's not the only one\nthat has products like this, right?\n\n340\n00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:59,940\nIf you look at the OS 10,\nthey have their Time Machine.\n\n341\n00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,880\nAnd it basically does the same thing.\n\n342\n00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,450\nIt's taking images of these files,\nbackups of these files,\n\n343\n00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,670\nand then it's gonna allow you to go\nback to those previous versions.\n\n344\n00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,116\nDaniel, I think you got Time Machine\n\n345\n00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:11,130\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I do.\n\n346\n00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,560\nI am running MAC OS so I can show\nyou guys the Time Machine stuff.\n\n347\n00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,151\nThere's my Mac desktop.\n\n348\n00:18:16,151 --> 00:18:19,901\nNow, I'm basically following the same\nkind of procedure the Mike was and\n\n349\n00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:22,940\nwhat we're trying to show\nus really how easy this is.\n\n350\n00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,618\nI've done just like Mike, I've got,\nI don't know if I can get it\n\n351\n00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:28,444\nin the shot here, but I just got one\nof these little terabyte drives,\n\n352\n00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:31,760\n50, 60 bucks or wherever Best Buy,\nAmazon something like that.\n\n353\n00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,070\nPlugged it into USB 3 nothing to it.\n\n354\n00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,040\nThe computer sees that it's connected.\n\n355\n00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,280\nAll I have to do is go\ninto my MacBook here.\n\n356\n00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,870\nI got the little Apple thing that's so\npretty, right?\n\n357\n00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,670\nAnd I have System Preferences,\ninside the System Preferences,\n\n358\n00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,230\nthere's this area right here\nthat says Time Machine.\n\n359\n00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:52,060\nAnd if I click on that, well,\nyou see how easy this really is.\n\n360\n00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,070\nIt's basically a big button\nthat says on or off.\n\n361\n00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,210\nWould you like us to do Time Machine, or\nwould you not like us to do Time Machine?\n\n362\n00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,480\nWell, yes sir thank you,\nI will have some Time Machine goodness.\n\n363\n00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,420\nAnd all I have to do is turn it on,\nwhich I have.\n\n364\n00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,331\nI actually do use Time Machine,\nthis is my personal laptop.\n\n365\n00:19:08,331 --> 00:19:11,161\nSo, I have that turned on,\nI don't want to lose my files.\n\n366\n00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:12,660\nSo, I have it turned on.\n\n367\n00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,990\nI can go here to select the disk\nwhich you see I've already done.\n\n368\n00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,759\nI have that 1 TB machine, but\nall I would have to do is go in here and\n\n369\n00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,341\nhit Select and choose the actual\ndevice from the drop-down.\n\n370\n00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:25,880\nI'm gonna cancel this because\nI've already done that.\n\n371\n00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,220\nAnd now it shows you how it works.\n\n372\n00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,740\nI can go into the Options to get\na little more fine tuned if I want to.\n\n373\n00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,910\nMaybe I want to exclude some\nthings from Time Machine.\n\n374\n00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,760\nBacking those up, I don't care about them.\n\n375\n00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,380\nSomething that effect, maybe.\n\n376\n00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,740\nWhatever case may be.\n\n377\n00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,890\nI can exclude them and\nit gives me that option.\n\n378\n00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:46,875\nOr I can say back up\nwhile on battery power.\n\n379\n00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:50,220\nBackup can use a little power\nbecause it's run the disks.\n\n380\n00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,640\nBoth of them,\nespecially that USB attached one,\n\n381\n00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,460\nit's going to take up some power as well.\n\n382\n00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,300\nSo sometimes it's not the best option,\nespecially if you're low on battery\n\n383\n00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,420\npower and all of a sudden it\nstarts checking a backup and\n\n384\n00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,030\nyou're like, oh no, don't do that.\n\n385\n00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:04,022\nSo you might need to gauge whether or\nnot you need that enabled.\n\n386\n00:20:04,022 --> 00:20:07,670\nBut other than that the defaults\non this are fantastic.\n\n387\n00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:11,000\nI'm gonna click Cancel here and\nbecause I've already got it running,\n\n388\n00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,160\nbecause like I said,\nall I had do was hit On.\n\n389\n00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,310\nI'll close this.\n\n390\n00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,560\nYou'll notice that this right\nover here says Time Machine.\n\n391\n00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,080\nNow that is the drive.\n\n392\n00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,840\nWhen I plug the drive in, it allocates\nthis as the actual Time Machine drive and\n\n393\n00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,620\nshows up as Time Machine.\n\n394\n00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,864\nSo if I double-click\non that It'll open up,\n\n395\n00:20:28,864 --> 00:20:31,950\nit'll show me there is my\nbackup folder right there.\n\n396\n00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:36,800\nAll I have to do is push through it, and\nI can see all the different histories.\n\n397\n00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,240\nNow, I can also get there another\nway just by going to the finder and\n\n398\n00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,710\ntyping in Time Machine and hitting Enter.\n\n399\n00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,841\nAnd it kinda gives me a little different\naspect in the way I can get into.\n\n400\n00:20:47,841 --> 00:20:52,070\nYou can see gives me a history\nbar to the right-hand side.\n\n401\n00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,070\nI can go back as far as I need, or\n\n402\n00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,120\nat least as far as it\nhas on the drive itself.\n\n403\n00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,270\nPick the file that I need to reclamate,\nget that file back, and\n\n404\n00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,240\nthen hit Restore right here.\n\n405\n00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,100\nNothing to it.\n\n406\n00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,200\nVery simple.\n\n407\n00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,330\nNow, I also have Linux.\n\n408\n00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,950\nWe don't wanna leave you\nLinux guys out in the weeds.\n\n409\n00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,340\nWe also have that option.\n\n410\n00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,960\nI'm gonna click Cancel here.\n\n411\n00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,686\nLet me move over to my Linux machine.\n\n412\n00:21:12,686 --> 00:21:14,760\nAnd all I have to do was go in here,\n\n413\n00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,430\nmost Linux distributions have some sort\nof backup utility built in nowadays,\n\n414\n00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:22,810\nespecially if you're in\na desktop environment.\n\n415\n00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:27,150\nSo this is Mint Linux and\nif I just type in backup, backup.\n\n416\n00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,960\nYou see we have a backup tool built in.\n\n417\n00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,670\nAgain, the concept, it's the same.\n\n418\n00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:37,830\nThe concept does not change from Windows\nto Mac to Linux, it is identical.\n\n419\n00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:41,440\nYou attach your drive,\nyou go to your backup software and\n\n420\n00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,420\nyou tell it what you want to do.\n\n421\n00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,670\nThis is asking me for\nmy administrator password.\n\n422\n00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,020\nAnd that way anybody that's not\nan admin can't get to those backup\n\n423\n00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,570\nfiles if they're logged\ninto your computer.\n\n424\n00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,810\nLinux is meant to be a bit\nmore of a multi-user system.\n\n425\n00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,450\nSo, that's why that's happening.\n\n426\n00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:57,790\nSo then I have backup files, right?\n\n427\n00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,490\nI just click that and\nit will make a backup of it.\n\n428\n00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,440\nYou see how very easy this is.\n\n429\n00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,150\nI can either back up the entire drive or\n\n430\n00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,080\nI can back up specific\nsoftware on the drive.\n\n431\n00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,610\nRight, and then if I need to restore?\n\n432\n00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:09,620\nWell, click Restore.\n\n433\n00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,900\nAnd it's gonna give me those options.\n\n434\n00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,730\nWe're gonna walk through it.\n\n435\n00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,810\nIt's gonna look very similar\nto what we've already seen.\n\n436\n00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,380\nBut basically,\nany operating systems you're running,\n\n437\n00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,292\nyou have some sort of backup utility.\n\n438\n00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:21,590\nAs you can see, it's very simple to use.\n\n439\n00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,520\nNo reason that we're not using this.\n\n440\n00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,300\n>> Absolutely.\n\n441\n00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,360\nAnd we've got a great question\nout there in chat room.\n\n442\n00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,975\nRick's asking, do any of these\nbackup methods encrypt the backup?\n\n443\n00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:31,675\nI can tell you that Windows does not.\n\n444\n00:22:31,675 --> 00:22:36,205\nI'm not sure about OS 10 or\nLinux, most likely not, though.\n\n445\n00:22:36,205 --> 00:22:38,940\nNow some of the third party software\nI'm gonna talk about in a minute\n\n446\n00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,380\nmight give you that option.\n\n447\n00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,036\nBut like with Windows, for example,\n\n448\n00:22:42,036 --> 00:22:44,674\nwhat you would want to do is\nyou'd want to enable Bitlocker or\n\n449\n00:22:44,674 --> 00:22:48,110\nsome other encryption method on that\ndrive that you're doing that backup to.\n\n450\n00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,060\nCuz the backup itself is\nnot gonna be encrypted.\n\n451\n00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,100\nSo, that's a very good\nquestion because what if\n\n452\n00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,280\nI leave that drive laying somewhere and\nsomebody picks it up?\n\n453\n00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,000\nNow there's a chance that they can\nbrowse through my file history and\n\n454\n00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,350\ntry to get access to some of those files.\n\n455\n00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,430\nA very good question and no,\n\n456\n00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:07,880\nyou'd have to either, if you're using a\nthird party software make sure that they,\n\n457\n00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,340\nsee if there's an option in\nthere to allow encryption.\n\n458\n00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,610\nIf you're using one of these built in ones\nmost likely you're gonna be using your\n\n459\n00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:14,560\nfull disk encryption.\n\n460\n00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,680\nIf you're not familiar\nwith full disk encryption,\n\n461\n00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,490\nmake sure you check out that episode that\nwe talked about full disk encryption.\n\n462\n00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,691\n>> An easy method to do that\nthough would just be using PGP.\n\n463\n00:23:24,691 --> 00:23:26,900\nIt's a free software.\n\n464\n00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,080\nYou just create your backup file,\nand then use PGP to encrypt that.\n\n465\n00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,340\nYou can store it wherever you want,\nand it is top level encryption.\n\n466\n00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,640\nNot likely to be cracked anytime soon,\nso you should be safe with that.\n\n467\n00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,860\n>> Exactly.\nAll right, so\n\n468\n00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,490\nwe've showed you guys a bunch of\na backup utilities that are built\n\n469\n00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,350\ninto the OS, right?\n\n470\n00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:46,910\nBuilt into Windows,\nbuilt into Mac, built into Linux.\n\n471\n00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:51,770\nThere's also third party software\nyou can go out and buy like Acronis,\n\n472\n00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,120\nor I'm trying to think of others.\n\n473\n00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,144\n>> Well, there's Ghost.\n>> Norton Ghost\n\n474\n00:23:55,144 --> 00:23:58,160\ngoes has a backup utility built into that.\n\n475\n00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,391\nSo, you can go out and buy some software.\n\n476\n00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:04,202\nWith that type of software, You can\ndo those IT style backups, typically.\n\n477\n00:24:04,202 --> 00:24:07,293\nRight, because those are things\nthat are usually running on your\n\n478\n00:24:07,293 --> 00:24:11,030\ncomputer doing that file history every\ntime you make a change to a file.\n\n479\n00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,640\nThose guys you would probably schedule\nto run in the middle of the night, and\n\n480\n00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,730\nthey would take a full system image or\ndo one of those differential or\n\n481\n00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,150\nincremental backups.\n\n482\n00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,260\nSo if you need something\na little more full featured,\n\n483\n00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,880\nif you wanna back up that entire\nhard drive, the operating system,\n\n484\n00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,330\nthe applications,\nyou would need something like that.\n\n485\n00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:32,070\nBecause the file history, like on Windows\nand that Time Machine on a Mac OS X,\n\n486\n00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:36,040\nthat's not backing up your applications,\nand your operating system, right?\n\n487\n00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,890\nThat's just backing up the files that\nare important to you, and that's okay.\n\n488\n00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:43,890\nFor most end users, if my operating\nsystem dies, I'm just gonna reinstall it,\n\n489\n00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,250\nand reinstall the applications.\n\n490\n00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,390\nThe main thing is,\nI still have my kids' pictures for\n\n491\n00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,830\nmy grandma, and things like that.\n\n492\n00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,570\nI've gotta make sure I have that.\n\n493\n00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,610\nI'm not too worried about\nthe actual operating system.\n\n494\n00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,770\nBut like I said, there are out there.\n\n495\n00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:59,820\nYou can do a Google search over a backup\nand you can find things like Norton Ghost\n\n496\n00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,800\nor Acronis True Image, or\nwe've used Altiris around here.\n\n497\n00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,940\nParagon is another one that has\na good drive backup software.\n\n498\n00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,613\nAnd we would be remiss if we didn't\nmention the whole new thing, right,\n\n499\n00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:15,251\nthe big buzzword's the cloud.\n\n500\n00:25:15,251 --> 00:25:16,910\nWe got to bring that in here as well.\n\n501\n00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:17,591\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n502\n00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:21,560\nWe live in a modern day and age and\nwe have cloud services available to us.\n\n503\n00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,720\nIf you haven't checked those out,\nwe also have a couple of episodes on cloud\n\n504\n00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,780\nservices, so very good stuff that will\nhelp you understand that a little better.\n\n505\n00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,660\nBut basically,\nI'm shoving my files up to somebody else,\n\n506\n00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,542\nletting them use their storage, use that.\n\n507\n00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:40,000\nAnd I just pay for the service,\nvery easy, very nice.\n\n508\n00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,610\n>> Absolutely.\n\n509\n00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,670\nRick had mentioned another\ngood point in there.\n\n510\n00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,490\nHe's talking about offsite.\n\n511\n00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,390\nOne of the things we do have\nto think about, more so\n\n512\n00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,240\nin the corporate environment\nthan the home environment, but\n\n513\n00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,240\nit's still something you\nmight wanna think about.\n\n514\n00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,110\nIf you've backed up your computer to this\nlittle portable drive and the computer and\n\n515\n00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,560\nthat drive are sitting\nin your office at home.\n\n516\n00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,063\nAnd somebody comes in and\nsteals your computer and that drive,\n\n517\n00:26:01,063 --> 00:26:04,051\nyou've lost your computer and\nyour back up, right?\n\n518\n00:26:04,051 --> 00:26:07,291\nOr if your, God forbid, your house\nburns down or something like that,\n\n519\n00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:08,751\nyou have some type of disaster.\n\n520\n00:26:08,751 --> 00:26:12,797\nWe might want to consider having\nan offsite storage for the home user,\n\n521\n00:26:12,797 --> 00:26:17,270\nthe end user that might not be as easy\nuntil now, until the cloud, all right?\n\n522\n00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:20,270\nCuz now, as Daniel said, I can just\nsend this stuff up to the cloud.\n\n523\n00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:23,520\nWe attach little balloons to our data and\nthey float away up.\n\n524\n00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,152\nThat's not the cloud.\n\n525\n00:26:24,152 --> 00:26:24,882\n>> [LAUGH] Not that type of cloud.\n\n526\n00:26:24,882 --> 00:26:27,893\n>> No, okay, yeah,\nthere's several different services.\n\n527\n00:26:27,893 --> 00:26:30,670\nAnd if we wanna pull up my screen,\nI've got one for example here.\n\n528\n00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,050\nThis is Carbonite.\n\n529\n00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,890\nIt's a very popular one.\n\n530\n00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,900\nYou can go through here take a look\nat some of their pricing plans.\n\n531\n00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,771\nBut you basically try to find how\nmuch space you're going to need.\n\n532\n00:26:40,771 --> 00:26:42,540\nLike here's personal plans.\n\n533\n00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,760\nSo I can click on Learn more.\n\n534\n00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,310\nWell, they got 30% off right now,\nso they got a good deal going.\n\n535\n00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:52,171\nAnd they'll talk about how it works and\ngive you all this information.\n\n536\n00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:56,131\nBut as Daniel said, you typically run\na little client on your computer.\n\n537\n00:26:56,131 --> 00:27:00,084\nAnd instead of storing those backups on\nthat little USB hard drive like I've got\n\n538\n00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:03,640\nhere, it's gonna send them out to\ntheir servers and store it up there.\n\n539\n00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,440\nAnd they'll give you so much space, and\n\n540\n00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,000\nagain, as you use that space up,\nfirst in first out.\n\n541\n00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,110\nBut now if something\nhappens to my house or\n\n542\n00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:16,420\nmy computer at home, I still have my\nbackup up there in the cloud, right?\n\n543\n00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,610\nAnd I can basically get to it from\nanywhere I've got Internet access.\n\n544\n00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:23,110\nAnd Carbonite's not the only one.\n\n545\n00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:26,530\nThere's IDrive, is another popular\none that I've seen people use, and\n\n546\n00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,600\nthey've got some pretty good prices.\n\n547\n00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:34,090\nHeck, your ISP most likely gives you some\nstorage space that you could use for\n\n548\n00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:36,440\nbacking up photos and\nvideos and things like that.\n\n549\n00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,330\nSo lots of different options\nwhen it comes to the cloud.\n\n550\n00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,190\n>> Yeah, speaking of those photos,\n\n551\n00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:46,750\nFlickr gives you a free terabyte\nof storage to upload photos to.\n\n552\n00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,950\nSo that's a lot for\na little, no money actually.\n\n553\n00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:51,860\nThat's a really good deal.\n\n554\n00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,247\nSo many ways in which we should be and\ncan be doing this so\n\n555\n00:27:55,247 --> 00:27:58,501\ndefinitely something we\nshould take advantage of.\n\n556\n00:27:58,501 --> 00:28:00,370\n>> And there's one thing I\nthink I failed to mention too.\n\n557\n00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:06,580\nI was talking about that software\nlike Acronis and Norton Ghost and\n\n558\n00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,090\nthings like that.\n\n559\n00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,330\nThose are paid, there are some\nfree ones you can get as well.\n\n560\n00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,670\nThere's some open source ones.\n\n561\n00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,910\nI think one of them was Syncthing.\n\n562\n00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,160\nThat was one I found from\na company called Source Force so\n\n563\n00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,100\ndon't think you have to pay for it.\n\n564\n00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:22,190\nAlthough you get a lot more features\ntypically with those paid versions, and\n\n565\n00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,100\nthey're really not that expensive.\n\n566\n00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,580\nSo, lots of options when it\ncomes to backing up your data.\n\n567\n00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,490\nThe most important thing is\nthat you do back up your data,\n\n568\n00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,660\nthat you figure out what's best for you.\n\n569\n00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,630\nDo I want to use what's built\ninto my operating system and\n\n570\n00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,360\njust do my file history?\n\n571\n00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,210\nBecause that's gonna keep track of my\ndocuments and pictures and music and\n\n572\n00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,420\nthings like that.\n\n573\n00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,430\nThen, I'm good to go.\n\n574\n00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,300\nI just need to know where in my\noperating system to turn it on.\n\n575\n00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,390\nI've gotta give it a location of\nwhere to store that information.\n\n576\n00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,990\nOr do I want more of an IT style backup?\n\n577\n00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:55,160\nDo I wanna go out and buy a Paragon Drive\nbackup where I can do a full system image.\n\n578\n00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,640\nThat way, if my hard drive fails, I can\nget my computer right back the way it was,\n\n579\n00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,270\nincluding the operating system or\nthe applications.\n\n580\n00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,590\nOr do I not wanna fool with it all?\n\n581\n00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,260\nMaybe I wanna pay a monthly or\nyearly subscription and\n\n582\n00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,690\njust back my stuff up to the cloud and\nsend it up there.\n\n583\n00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,026\nThat way,\nthey've got redundant hardware, right.\n\n584\n00:29:11,026 --> 00:29:13,270\nIf their server fails,\nthey've got multiple copies.\n\n585\n00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,060\nWe don't have to worry about that.\n\n586\n00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,241\nSo, I just send it up there,\nand I know it's safe.\n\n587\n00:29:17,241 --> 00:29:19,190\nAnd I can get to it from any machine.\n\n588\n00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,815\nSo the biggest thing though is to\nunderstand why you need to do a backup,\n\n589\n00:29:23,815 --> 00:29:25,535\nbecause I need to keep my data safe.\n\n590\n00:29:25,535 --> 00:29:28,385\nThere's all kinds of things\nthat can happen to it, and\n\n591\n00:29:28,385 --> 00:29:32,885\nwhere I can go to turn it on in my OS, or\ndo I need to go out and buy something.\n\n592\n00:29:32,885 --> 00:29:34,910\nOr do I wanna use one of\nthese new cloud services?\n\n593\n00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,346\n>> Yeah, well that's awesome stuff.\n\n594\n00:29:37,346 --> 00:29:40,626\nHopefully you guys have learned a lot\nabout why we should be backing stuff up\n\n595\n00:29:40,626 --> 00:29:41,887\nand how we can be backing up.\n\n596\n00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:44,780\nSuper easy, so\ndefinitely take advantage of that.\n\n597\n00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:48,600\nThat being said, I think we've wrapped\nit up nicely with a little bow for you.\n\n598\n00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,630\nCome to the end of another great episode.\n\n599\n00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:54,000\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n600\n00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,880\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n601\n00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,909\n>> And we'll see

another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,730\nI'll be your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,310\nAnd here with me today is\nnone other than Mike Rodrick.\n\n6\n00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,310\nHow are you doing today Mike?\n\n7\n00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,820\n>> I'm doing fantastic, Daniel.\n\n8\n00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,685\nLike you said,\n\n9\n00:00:22,685 --> 00:00:27,430\nwe've got another great episode of\nsecurity fundamentals coming your way.\n\n10\n00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,490\nAnd this one, we're gonna be\ntalking about hardware redundancy.\n\n11\n00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,790\nNow, we're gonna be looking at this\nfrom the end user's perspective.\n\n12\n00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,310\nFrom the IT side of things,\n\n13\n00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:40,670\nyou know hardware redundancy usually means\nhaving multiple pieces of equipment.\n\n14\n00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,860\nLike if that switch fails I've got\nan extra switch to put back in its place.\n\n15\n00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,820\nI don't have to wait to order one or\n\n16\n00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,160\nhaving redundant power supplies on\nour servers and things like that.\n\n17\n00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,520\nMultiple paths, multiple routers,\njust redundancy so\n\n18\n00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,580\nthat if something fails,\nI've got a replacement for it, right?\n\n19\n00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,270\nThat's called fault tolerance.\n\n20\n00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,760\nAnd I wanna be able to survive\nsmall predictable failures.\n\n21\n00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,540\nFrom an end user's perspective, though,\n\n22\n00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,895\nit really takes on a little bit\ndifferent perspective, I guess.\n\n23\n00:01:10,895 --> 00:01:12,145\nCuz we don't have the same.\n\n24\n00:01:12,145 --> 00:01:12,945\nWe're not gonna go out and\n\n25\n00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:16,785\nhave a second computer sitting there\nwaiting in case the first one fails.\n\n26\n00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:21,835\nI can't put two, typically, I can't\nput two power supplies in my laptop.\n\n27\n00:01:21,835 --> 00:01:22,705\nAnd things like that.\n\n28\n00:01:22,705 --> 00:01:26,525\nSo, when we talk about hardware\nredundancy from the end user perspective,\n\n29\n00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:31,170\nwe're really talking about is, well,\nwe're gonna talk about power and disks.\n\n30\n00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,970\nThose are the two big things I think\nthat as an end user we can provide\n\n31\n00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,040\nthat redundancy form.\n\n32\n00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,530\nNow what we'll start with, power.\n\n33\n00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,340\nAnd as I said I can't really squeeze\nanother power supply into my laptop.\n\n34\n00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,540\nIf you've got a tower\ncomputer at your desk or\n\n35\n00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,810\nat home, you might be able to shoehorn\nanother power supply in there.\n\n36\n00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,190\nBut they're really not meant for\nthat right?\n\n37\n00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,670\nSo how do we provide redundant power?\n\n38\n00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,040\nAnd why would I need it?\n\n39\n00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,000\nWell, because we have power failures,\nright?\n\n40\n00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,990\nEspecially here in Florida.\n\n41\n00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,560\nIn fact, yesterday, for example, we had\na major thunderstorm roll through, and\n\n42\n00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,670\nthe power flickered.\n\n43\n00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,680\nIt didn't stay off for long, but\n\n44\n00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,850\nit was long enough to reboot everybody's\nmachines and a couple of the servers here.\n\n45\n00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,790\nAnd the problem is if I'm in the middle of\na document that I've been working on and\n\n46\n00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,330\nhaven't been doing my Ctrl+S or\nmy Save every so\n\n47\n00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,630\noften, I could have lost\na whole lot of work.\n\n48\n00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:24,665\nSo what we can do is we can provide\npower for a brief period of time\n\n49\n00:02:24,665 --> 00:02:29,325\nto allow us to continue to work\nthrough those small outages.\n\n50\n00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:31,585\nOr even just through some brown edges.\n\n51\n00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:34,285\nLike some sags or some spikes.\n\n52\n00:02:34,285 --> 00:02:38,815\nAnd we do that via something called\nan uninterruptible power supply.\n\n53\n00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:42,655\nThese are small devices that\nwe will plug into the wall and\n\n54\n00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:45,528\nthen we can plug the other\nend into our computer.\n\n55\n00:02:45,528 --> 00:02:49,260\nAnd what will happen is it'll monitor\nthe power on our computer and\n\n56\n00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,290\nif it detects a sag or\na spike it can filter that out.\n\n57\n00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:59,085\nIf the power goes out, I've got enough\npower on this UPS to run my system for\n\n58\n00:02:59,085 --> 00:03:02,665\na little while longer, so\nthat I can save everything and\n\n59\n00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:05,040\ngo through a proper shutdown.\n\n60\n00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,500\nOtherwise if you have a power failure,\n\n61\n00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,724\nit's like unplugging the computer\nfrom the wall, right?\n\n62\n00:03:08,724 --> 00:03:12,460\nEverything that you're in the middle of\nthat you haven't saved is gonna be gone.\n\n63\n00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:17,100\n>> Now Mike, you say that it supplies\npower, but how the heck does it do that?\n\n64\n00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,140\nAs you said, it's plugged into the wall.\n\n65\n00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,460\nAnd then, it's plugged in the computer,\nand in between there, what's it doing?\n\n66\n00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,080\nI've got my computer plugged into that.\n\n67\n00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,250\nHow is it providing that power?\n\n68\n00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,420\n>> That's a good question.\n\n69\n00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,715\nAnd what it is, it's got some batteries\nin there that are going to charge up,\n\n70\n00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:33,835\njust like you would your laptop battery.\n\n71\n00:03:33,835 --> 00:03:38,245\nSo when you plug a device into the wall,\nthe electricity is coming into the device,\n\n72\n00:03:38,245 --> 00:03:39,625\nit's doing two things.\n\n73\n00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:43,415\nOn that device is a plug\nto plug your computer into.\n\n74\n00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:48,070\nAnd so there's power coming from the wall\nthrough the device into your computer.\n\n75\n00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,940\nIt's also being routed to\nthe batteries to charge those.\n\n76\n00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,360\nAnd it's got this circuitry inside that as\nsoon as it detects that the power is no\n\n77\n00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,640\nlonger coming from the wall, it switches\nyour computer to the batteries.\n\n78\n00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,450\nAnd it does it within a few milliseconds.\n\n79\n00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,740\nI think 30 milliseconds,\ndepending on how much you wannna spend.\n\n80\n00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,850\nAnd that's quick enough to where\nthe computer really won't notice\n\n81\n00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,380\nthat power failure.\n\n82\n00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,220\nAnd it allows me to continue\nto run that machine.\n\n83\n00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,860\nNow you do have to have it\nplugged into the device.\n\n84\n00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,630\nIf I have external devices like\na printer and things like that.\n\n85\n00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,510\nIf they're not plugged into UPS\nthey're not going to have any\n\n86\n00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,810\npower when the power goes out, all right?\n\n87\n00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,270\nSo everything that you need\nis gonna be plugged into that\n\n88\n00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,160\nuninterruptible power supply.\n\n89\n00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,140\nBut I don't want to give\nyou the wrong impression.\n\n90\n00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,850\nYou don't plug everything on\nyour desk into this device.\n\n91\n00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,900\nAnd when the power goes out you continue\nto work, and you continue to play your\n\n92\n00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,270\nvideo game or your YouTube videos or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n93\n00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,340\nThat's not what this is for.\n\n94\n00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,870\nWe're not talking about\na full blown generator that's\n\n95\n00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,900\nkicking out unlimited amounts of power.\n\n96\n00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,070\nThere's a battery in there.\n\n97\n00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,720\nIt only store so much energy.\n\n98\n00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,440\nAnd once that power from the wall stops,\n\n99\n00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,960\neverything is being fed\noff of those batteries.\n\n100\n00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,090\nAnd they're gonna drain pretty quickly,\n\n101\n00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,330\ndepending on what what you're\nrunning in that machine.\n\n102\n00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,270\n>> Yeah, typically, I've worked a lot\nwith these small units that would go to\n\n103\n00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,230\na desktop or a laptop environment.\n\n104\n00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:12,370\nAnd typically, depending on what\nyou have actually connected to it,\n\n105\n00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,620\nthe load will last for about,\nanywhere between 10, maybe 15 minutes.\n\n106\n00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,100\nIf it's just a laptop, if it's just a\ncomputer, you might get more out of there.\n\n107\n00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,160\n20, 25, maybe even 30 minutes out of that.\n\n108\n00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,890\nBut, then most people have a docking\nstation, and speakers, and a printer, and\n\n109\n00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,150\na bunch of other peripherals that\nthey're also plugging into that.\n\n110\n00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,710\nPeople don't even realize\nthat that's what that was.\n\n111\n00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,570\nThey thought oh, there's a power strip.\n\n112\n00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,070\nRight, well that power strip is about\nlike a loaf of bread, it's good size.\n\n113\n00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,880\nAnd if you try to pick it up,\nit's pretty hefty.\n\n114\n00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,510\nIt actually has a motorcycle battery\ninside of it, it's a good sized battery.\n\n115\n00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,900\nBut like Mike said,\nit's not gonna last forever,\n\n116\n00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:53,280\nit's not gonna give you\na unending supply of power.\n\n117\n00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,340\nBut it will give you enough to be able to,\nyou see the power is out,\n\n118\n00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,556\nyou think maybe okay, I'll give it\na few seconds, see if it comes back.on.\n\n119\n00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:05,570\nIt doesn't, I can start saving my work,\npowering down my devices properly so\n\n120\n00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,730\nthat there's no errors being made,\nthere's no data being corrupted or lost.\n\n121\n00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,830\nAnd that's what we're looking for.\n\n122\n00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,680\nThat's the whole purpose of these things,\n\n123\n00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,620\nis to keep you out of trouble when\na power spike, surge, brownout,\n\n124\n00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,030\nblackout, whatever the case is happening,\nkeeps you out of that trouble.\n\n125\n00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,780\n>> Exactly, and we're not gonna,\nnow there's different types\n\n126\n00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,000\nof UPSs that we're not gonna break down\nfor you in this particular episode.\n\n127\n00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,170\nSome of them are active,\nsome of them are passive.\n\n128\n00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,700\nAnd just in simple terms if it's a passive\nwhat's happening is your computer,\n\n129\n00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,440\nthat power is coming through\nthe UPS from the wall, and\n\n130\n00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,390\nthen going into the computer directly.\n\n131\n00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,900\nAnd then if the power fails\nit switches to batteries.\n\n132\n00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,080\nThe active ones are a little\nmore proactive, hence the name.\n\n133\n00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,020\nAnd your computer's always being\nfed from the batteries, and\n\n134\n00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,180\nthen the batteries are constantly\nbeing recharged from the wall.\n\n135\n00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,850\nAdvantage of something like that,\nis I get good, clean power.\n\n136\n00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,960\nOne thing we might not realize is that\npower that's coming out of your wall.\n\n137\n00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,480\nIf you ever take a volt meter and\n\n138\n00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,420\ntest your wall outlets, you'll see\nthat it doesn't sit there at 120.\n\n139\n00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,280\nIt doesn't stay right there,\n\n140\n00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,790\nyou have constant little sags and\nsurges that are going on.\n\n141\n00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,450\nTypically not enough to hurt anything, but\n\n142\n00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:13,210\ncomputers are very\nsensitive to that stuff.\n\n143\n00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:17,500\nSo an active UPS actually provides a nice,\nclean, stable power.\n\n144\n00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,410\nBut you're gonna pay a lot more for that.\n\n145\n00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,890\nAnd as Dan was saying,\nwe just wanna hook up our basic stuff.\n\n146\n00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:24,680\nI'm not gonna hook up.\n\n147\n00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,170\nI think David in the chat room says,\ndon't hook up your laser printer to it.\n\n148\n00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:33,800\nAbsolutely, if the power fails what I need\nto do is what we call a graceful shutdown.\n\n149\n00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,297\nInstead of the power failing and my\ncomputer's going [SOUND] and flatlining,\n\n150\n00:07:38,297 --> 00:07:41,410\nI wanna be able to save my Word document,\nclose Word,\n\n151\n00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,510\ngo down to my little Start button,\nand power off the system normally.\n\n152\n00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,849\nIt shuts down and I've got enough\npower in the batteries to allow that.\n\n153\n00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:50,249\nSo I need my computer,\n\n154\n00:07:50,249 --> 00:07:54,693\nany external drives that are necessary\nwould need to be hooked up to it.\n\n155\n00:07:54,693 --> 00:07:58,426\nAnd my monitor is another thing cuz I'm\ngoing to be able to see what I'm doing.\n\n156\n00:07:58,426 --> 00:08:00,005\nWhen I try to shut that down.\n\n157\n00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:04,878\nBut my DVD burner, my external\nDVD burners, my speaker system,\n\n158\n00:08:04,878 --> 00:08:07,190\nmy desk lamp, all that stuff.\n\n159\n00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,010\nWe don't plug that stuff in to that UPS.\n\n160\n00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,820\nSo, one of the things you've gotta do.\n\n161\n00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,290\nIf you're gonna go out and buy a UPS for\nyour desktop at work or for\n\n162\n00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,040\nyour one in your.\n\n163\n00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,110\nSoho at home, you need to figure\nout how much power do I need?\n\n164\n00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:25,440\nBecause these can range in cost from\na few $100 to way more than that,\n\n165\n00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,770\ndepending on what you need to run and\nhow long you need it to run for.\n\n166\n00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:34,790\nSo what I've got here on my screen,\nAPC, is a big company, well known for\n\n167\n00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:38,470\ntheir UPS's, and they've got a great\nlittle calculator that you can use.\n\n168\n00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,570\nSo I'm going to come over here where\nit says, home, home office, and\n\n169\n00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,319\nsmall business and click on that link.\n\n170\n00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:46,636\nAnd I've got two ways I can try\nto determine what UPS I need.\n\n171\n00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:49,890\nI can either do it by load or by device.\n\n172\n00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,950\nAnd if I know, I could go through all\nmy products and I could think about it.\n\n173\n00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:58,340\nOkay, how much does my CD-ROM drive burn,\nuse power-wise?\n\n174\n00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,010\nHow much does my monitor use power-wise?\n\n175\n00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,610\nAnd all that stuff and try to add it up,\nand I could figure it out that way.\n\n176\n00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,080\nMost of us however,\nprobably not gonna wanna do that or\n\n177\n00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,860\ndon't know those numbers, so we also\nhave the option to do it by device.\n\n178\n00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,090\nAnd if I click on Configure by Device,\nIt's gonna bring me to the next screen,\n\n179\n00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,970\nmy little UPS Selector.\n\n180\n00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,680\nAnd I can see this,\nExtra Power for future expansion.\n\n181\n00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,160\nIn other words,\ndo I want to future-proof this?\n\n182\n00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,300\nDo I wanna buy a UPS that'll handle\nwhat I've got right now, but\n\n183\n00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,365\nthen if I add a couple of other, let's say\nyou add more cards inside your computer.\n\n184\n00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:35,005\nLike, you open your computer up and\nyou add a couple of expansion cards like\n\n185\n00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:39,535\na better video card or a sound card or\na second network adapter.\n\n186\n00:09:39,535 --> 00:09:41,595\nAll of that takes power, right.\n\n187\n00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:45,195\nSo if I want to future-proof myself I can,\nI can say, give me an extra 25%,\n\n188\n00:09:45,195 --> 00:09:50,660\nthat way if I add another card in I don't\nhave to buy another UPS cuz now the one\n\n189\n00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:56,070\nthat I have is not going to cover it, and\nthen desired runtime during power failure.\n\n190\n00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,810\nYou see it defaults to five minutes,\nand I've got my drop down list and\n\n191\n00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:04,920\nI'll try a couple of them to show you\nsome of the different price points here,\n\n192\n00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,050\nbut five minutes, and I'm running\non North American 120 volt, and\n\n193\n00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,000\nI need to power my PC workstation.\n\n194\n00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,520\nAnd then it asks me what type\nof work station I've got.\n\n195\n00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,970\nYou see I've got a few different choices.\n\n196\n00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,250\nI'll leave it on a mini tower here.\n\n197\n00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,020\nI could use from desktop and\na couple of the the iMac's listed there.\n\n198\n00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:28,250\nThe monitor type,\nI have a 22 inch LCD, all right?\n\n199\n00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,060\nProcessor type,\nthis can make a big difference.\n\n200\n00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,610\nThose faster processors use\na lot more electricity.\n\n201\n00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,280\nSo I wanna make sure I\nchoose the proper one.\n\n202\n00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,540\nMaybe I'll go down here and\nfind myself an i5 of some kind.\n\n203\n00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:51,010\nHow many populated PCI slots do I have,\nthose expansion slots inside my computer?\n\n204\n00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,840\nZero to two, you see I've got\na couple different options.\n\n205\n00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,870\nI'll leave it on zero to two.\n\n206\n00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,410\nThat's about average.\n\n207\n00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,670\nInternal hard drives.\n\n208\n00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,070\nMaybe I've got a second hard\ndrive in that computer.\n\n209\n00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,640\nTotal external drives.\n\n210\n00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,130\nDo I want to you know power\nthose external drives?\n\n211\n00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,730\nI mean, I've got one that I'm doing my\nfile history to it I wanna make sure that\n\n212\n00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,560\nmaintains power.\n\n213\n00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,100\nHard drive type.\n\n214\n00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,540\nWell, do you have solid state?\n\n215\n00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,960\nAre they serial attached?\n\n216\n00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,990\nAre they IDE?\n\n217\n00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,070\nThat'll also make a difference.\n\n218\n00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:20,320\nI'll leave it on that high RPM hard drive.\n\n219\n00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,430\nNice mechanical drive.\n\n220\n00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,420\nMy site uses 120.\n\n221\n00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,630\nAnd then my plug type, they actually have\na cool little graphic that you can use\n\n222\n00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,850\nbecause I don't know my plug type but I\ncan click on the picture for my plug type.\n\n223\n00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:36,500\n[LAUGH] All right, so I've picked that and\nI just want one, I think I'll leave it at\n\n224\n00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,670\nthat and I'll click add to summary and\nit's telling me that I'm going to need\n\n225\n00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:47,610\nabout a 190 watts of power to maintain\neverything that I just told it, right?\n\n226\n00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,850\nSo let me go back up here in\nthe little save and continue, and\n\n227\n00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,780\nwe'll see what APC comes up with.\n\n228\n00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,610\nIt's whirring and grinding and\n\n229\n00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,860\ndoing all that math in the background so\nthat I don't have to do it.\n\n230\n00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,930\nAnd there we go,\nit gives me a few different options.\n\n231\n00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:08,250\nI can see one for best price,\nbest value, and best performance.\n\n232\n00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,370\nAnd you can see the difference in\nthe prices, best price is only $70 bucks.\n\n233\n00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,080\nBest performance is $170 bucks.\n\n234\n00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,250\nAnd keep in mind I said I only need\nto run for about five minutes.\n\n235\n00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,910\nThat's going to give me enough\ntime to save all my work and\n\n236\n00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,300\nshut down my computer, all right?\n\n237\n00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,850\nAnd if we compare these guys,\nlet's compare that best performance and\n\n238\n00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,809\nmy best value, heck,\nwe'll compare all three of them.\n\n239\n00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,230\nTake a look at what\nthe big differences are.\n\n240\n00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,150\nWhy is one of them $6, $70 bucks and\none of them $180 bucks?\n\n241\n00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:43,060\nAll right, and\nas we look at our details down here.\n\n242\n00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,860\nAnd you can see that this is my most\nexpensive ones over here on the right.\n\n243\n00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,540\nYou can see,\nit's kicking out a lot more watts, right?\n\n244\n00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,570\n600 watts versus only 390, versus 330.\n\n245\n00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,545\nAlso, it's gonna make a difference\non some of your inputs.\n\n246\n00:12:56,545 --> 00:12:58,380\nThose look all about the same.\n\n247\n00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,430\nBatteries are about the same.\n\n248\n00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,530\nCommunication and management,\nthis can differ as well.\n\n249\n00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,490\nDaniel, we were talking about that.\n\n250\n00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,020\nSoftware PowerChute,\n\n251\n00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:13,000\nthat APC has some software you can install\nthat allows you to monitor UPS cuz\n\n252\n00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,640\nthose batteries eventually might\nneed to be replaced, right.\n\n253\n00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,320\nThey won't hold a charge,\njust like the battery in your laptop.\n\n254\n00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,120\nThey're gonna lose their\nability to hold that charge\n\n255\n00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,130\nwhich means I won't have as\nmuch power when they're needed.\n\n256\n00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,640\nSo I want to make sure\nthe batteries are maintained and\n\n257\n00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,940\nthat UPS PowerChute software\nwill allow me to do that.\n\n258\n00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,686\n>> Yeah, I think an average battery lasts\nabout two to four years depending on how\n\n259\n00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:38,547\nmuch work you've made it do and how often\nit's been discharged and recharged and\n\n260\n00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:40,451\nthose kind of things all play a factor.\n\n261\n00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:44,237\nSo, definitely having\nthe ability to monitor your UPS.\n\n262\n00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:47,540\nAnd that PowerChute software, I've worked\nwith that quite extensively actually.\n\n263\n00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,990\nYou can do a lot with it.\n\n264\n00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,780\nIt's very nice,\nset up alerts things like that.\n\n265\n00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,640\nAnd even the device itself\nwill make an audible,\n\n266\n00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,450\nvery annoying noise [LAUGH] when\nit starts to lose a charge.\n\n267\n00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,600\nAny time that the battery is\nnot charged it will sense that\n\n268\n00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,610\nit has a little voltage meter inside\nof it to try to make sure that\n\n269\n00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,090\neverything is kept to a certain degree.\n\n270\n00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,060\nIt goes below that, it starts the beep.\n\n271\n00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,400\nIt starts, beep, beep, beep, beep.\n\n272\n00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,480\nAnd I had plenty of people call my office\nand say I've got this thing behind my desk\n\n273\n00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,130\nand it's beeping and I'm like, yes\napparently your power supply is old and\n\n274\n00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,980\nit's time to have that replaced and\nit's beeping to let us know that.\n\n275\n00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:27,660\nSo it's nice, even if you don't have the\nsoftware installed at least you'll know.\n\n276\n00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,490\nIf maybe the battery's being discharged,\nright?\n\n277\n00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:35,330\nIt's even lead to help people realize\nthat their wall outlet stopped working.\n\n278\n00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:40,100\nMaybe a wire got cut, something like that\nhappened, and their UPS started to beep,\n\n279\n00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,430\nand we checked everything out and\nwe realized,\n\n280\n00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:46,120\nthere doesn't seem to be\nanything wrong with the UPS.\n\n281\n00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,270\nYou might want to have an electrician\ncome in and check that outlet,\n\n282\n00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,380\ncuz we would switch to a different and\neverything would work.\n\n283\n00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,000\nSo that let them know we did, there was\na cut, we put something in the wall and\n\n284\n00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000\nwe didn't realize when we had cut\nthe wire and there was no actual power so\n\n285\n00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,680\nit's doing a lot of monitoring for us that\nwe might not even realize that it can do.\n\n286\n00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,240\n>> Absolutely, and\nyou can see here this more expensive one,\n\n287\n00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,520\nwell, all three of them looks like it\nhas the 10Base-T or the Ethernet plug.\n\n288\n00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,530\nCuz that's another one of the things you\nthink about as far as surges go, and\n\n289\n00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,520\nspikes.\n\n290\n00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,420\nWe always think about that power line,\nright?\n\n291\n00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,550\nBut what if you've got a data\ncable connected to your computer,\n\n292\n00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:26,120\nif you've got a coaxial cable,\nan Ethernet cable.\n\n293\n00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,020\nThose surges can travel\ndown those as well, and\n\n294\n00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,560\nthese particular devices have plugs for\nthat.\n\n295\n00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,210\nSo that cable that comes from your wall\nthat gives you the Internet access,\n\n296\n00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,330\nit actually goes into the UPS,\n\n297\n00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,410\nand then a second cable out\nof the UPS to your computer.\n\n298\n00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,810\nSo, now if there's any\nsurges that go across that,\n\n299\n00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:43,040\nit can protect you from that as well.\n\n300\n00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,290\nNow just out of curiosity, Daniel,\nlet's go back up here and let's change.\n\n301\n00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,070\nLet's go back to our UPS selectors, so\n\n302\n00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,570\nthat was five minutes,\nthe really nice one was a $180 bucks.\n\n303\n00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,720\nLet's change our runtime.\n\n304\n00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,774\nI want to change this up to,\nlet's say I want to run 30 minutes.\n\n305\n00:15:58,774 --> 00:16:02,358\n>> You've got to remember,\nthat what Mike had set first was.\n\n306\n00:16:02,358 --> 00:16:04,875\nAt the least five minutes of runtime.\n\n307\n00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:08,556\nNow we're changing that and we're saying\nyou know what, I need to get a little more\n\n308\n00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:12,286\nperformance out of this, I need to have at\nleast 30 minutes, I need to have at least\n\n309\n00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:15,990\n25, and it's whatever the case may be,\nand that's what we're changing here.\n\n310\n00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:18,486\nSo it's not that it works\nup to five minutes,\n\n311\n00:16:18,486 --> 00:16:20,665\nit is at least giving you five minutes.\n\n312\n00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:24,193\nAnd you may get more, like we said before,\ndepending on what you have plugged in,\n\n313\n00:16:24,193 --> 00:16:25,692\nhow much charge is on the battery.\n\n314\n00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:27,955\n>> So I'm gonna jump up to 30 minutes,\n\n315\n00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:30,585\nI had to go back through that wizard-\n>> The wizard?\n\n316\n00:16:30,585 --> 00:16:33,465\n>> Again, yeah, and you can see they also\ngive you the options for other devices.\n\n317\n00:16:33,465 --> 00:16:37,150\nLike if you want to hook up your\nwireless access point to one of these.\n\n318\n00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:41,080\nMaybe you buy a second one that goes\nin your closet where your modem is and\n\n319\n00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,691\nyour wireless access point is, so\nit wouldn't need as much power maybe.\n\n320\n00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:48,750\nAgain, 30 minutes on a PC workstation and\nI'll just leave all the same\n\n321\n00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,375\nchoices we did last time so\nwe can compare apples to apples.\n\n322\n00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:56,460\nSo 24 inch monitor, I did an Intel i5M or\n\n323\n00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:02,269\nan i5-500, where'd I go there, 500.\n\n324\n00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:08,110\nWe did two internal drives and\nI did one external drive, high RPM.\n\n325\n00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,233\nWe'll pick our plug there.\n\n326\n00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:14,498\nThat doesn't have anything to do with how\nmuch power or anything, that's just so\n\n327\n00:17:14,498 --> 00:17:16,650\nthey build you the right machine, right?\n\n328\n00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,840\nAnd we'll click Add Summary.\n\n329\n00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,180\nI'll click Save and Continue.\n\n330\n00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,826\nSo now I'm up to 190 watts.\n\n331\n00:17:22,826 --> 00:17:24,243\nActually, I'm sorry, that was the same.\n\n332\n00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,498\nBut now I'm up to 30 minutes\non my runtime required.\n\n333\n00:17:31,722 --> 00:17:33,730\nWe wait for\nit to do its magic in the background.\n\n334\n00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,870\nAnd now my best price is more than the\nbest performance was on the five minutes.\n\n335\n00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:48,700\nAnd you see my best performance is up\nto almost $600 US for that device.\n\n336\n00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,700\nSo again, if this is not something\nthat you buy typically so\n\n337\n00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,720\nthat I can continue to work through\na power failure where they've cut the line\n\n338\n00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,895\nit's gonna be three hours before\nthey get the power back on, or\n\n339\n00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:02,230\nhurricane's come through and\ntaken out power.\n\n340\n00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,410\nThat's not what these are for,\n\n341\n00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:07,670\nthat's generators that you have to run\nto provide you that kind of power.\n\n342\n00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,693\nThese things are giving you the ability\nto shut that thing down gracefully.\n\n343\n00:18:10,693 --> 00:18:13,800\nAnd if you need more than five minutes,\nyou're gonna pay for it,\n\n344\n00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,940\nthe price starts going up tremendously.\n\n345\n00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,830\n>> Yeah, and\nMike hit the nail on the head.\n\n346\n00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,479\nIf you really need more power than that\nand you're like, I cannot go offline,\n\n347\n00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:23,490\ngenerators are gonna\nbe the way you can go.\n\n348\n00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:27,280\nEven with a small business like a SOHO,\nnot a big deal.\n\n349\n00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,170\nYou can go to Home Depot or\nLowe's if you're in America.\n\n350\n00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,440\nI don't know if they have those in other,\n\n351\n00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,710\nany hardware store should\nhave generators for sale.\n\n352\n00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,770\nFill the thing full of gas,\n\n353\n00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,720\nit's gonna give you a few\nhours of uninterrupted power.\n\n354\n00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,890\nSo if you need that,\nyou can go that route.\n\n355\n00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,220\nThese are just so\n\n356\n00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,030\nthat you can actually gracefully shut\nyour machine down, save your work.\n\n357\n00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,040\nThat's the kind of thing we're\ntalking about when it comes to a UPS.\n\n358\n00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,770\nNot that they don't get pretty expensive,\nI've seen big dogs.\n\n359\n00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:56,450\nI've seen battery banks of\nthousands of 12-volt batteries, and\n\n360\n00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:02,200\nthen diesel generators with enough diesel\nfuel to power a building for a month.\n\n361\n00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,241\nPlenty of power there, but\nprobably not what you're gonna go for.\n\n362\n00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:07,310\n[LAUGH]\n>> No, no, typically enough for\n\n363\n00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,421\nyour home or small office or\nsomething like that.\n\n364\n00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:10,138\n>> Unless you're Bill Gates.\n\n365\n00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:11,311\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n366\n00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:14,310\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nthat's redundancy power-wise.\n\n367\n00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,092\nAgain, we're not talking about\nredundant power supplies.\n\n368\n00:19:16,092 --> 00:19:20,835\nJust giving us enough power to last\nthrough a sag or something like that so\n\n369\n00:19:20,835 --> 00:19:23,135\nthat my computer doesn't shut down,\nI don't lose anything.\n\n370\n00:19:23,135 --> 00:19:24,975\nOr if it's a complete power failure,\n\n371\n00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:29,785\nI've got enough time to do that graceful\nshutdown so I don't lose any of my work.\n\n372\n00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:33,545\nAnother common item that we're gonna\nprovide redundancy for in a home or\n\n373\n00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:36,850\nsmall office would be our disks, right?\n\n374\n00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,700\nNow in a corporate environment\nin our server closet\n\n375\n00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,010\nwe've got massive storage area networks.\n\n376\n00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,486\nWe've got these SAN devices that have\nbanks of hard drives in there and we're\n\n377\n00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:50,670\nrunning RAID 10 or something like that\nwhere I've got really good redundancy.\n\n378\n00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,880\nIf a drive fails we pop that drive out,\nwe throw another one in.\n\n379\n00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,790\nThere is very little downtime,\nit just has to rebuild, we're good to go.\n\n380\n00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:02,040\nBut for my desktop, I don't have\na full blown SAN sitting there,\n\n381\n00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,250\nI can't put ten more hard\ndrives into my little laptop.\n\n382\n00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,360\nSo how do I provide redundancy for that?\n\n383\n00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,617\nAnd one of the easiest ways to do it\nis something known as network-attached\n\n384\n00:20:13,617 --> 00:20:14,290\nstorage.\n\n385\n00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:19,560\nAnd all it is is a box, typically,\nthat has a few hard drives in there,\n\n386\n00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,810\nand it's connected to your network\njust like any other device.\n\n387\n00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:27,347\nAnd then you can store your data on that\ndevice, and that device is running some\n\n388\n00:20:27,347 --> 00:20:30,741\ntype of software that's gonna\nprovide that redundancy.\n\n389\n00:20:30,741 --> 00:20:33,438\nSo that if one of those drives fails,\n\n390\n00:20:33,438 --> 00:20:37,973\nI can still replace that drive and\nmaintain access to my data.\n\n391\n00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:42,292\n>> Yeah, I love these types of devices\nbecause it's basically like having a nice\n\n392\n00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:44,200\nlittle file server at your house.\n\n393\n00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,980\nAnd all you do is you plug it\nin the wall and give it power.\n\n394\n00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,800\nYou plug into the network, and\n\n395\n00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,190\nit shows up like any other\ndevice on your home network.\n\n396\n00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,585\nIt just looks like another computer.\n\n397\n00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,870\nYou have a nice drive there and\nyou map that down to your computer.\n\n398\n00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,430\nStart shoving files up to it and\nyou're good to go.\n\n399\n00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,570\nVery simple.\n\n400\n00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,330\n>> Yeah, and\nit's got a lot of benefits to it.\n\n401\n00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:06,910\nNot only is it giving me redundancy for my\ndata, because it's attached to the network\n\n402\n00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:10,500\nthat means I can get to that storage from\nany one of the machines on my network.\n\n403\n00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,707\nSo if you're like me and\nyou've got a desktop in your office,\n\n404\n00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:17,841\nyou've got a laptop that you use out in\nthe living room, you've got your Roku or\n\n405\n00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:19,528\nsomething hooked up to your TV.\n\n406\n00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,870\nI can connect all those, they can all\nsee that network-attached storage.\n\n407\n00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:28,050\nAnd I can pull data so you can basically\nshare that data across those devices and\n\n408\n00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:28,709\nyou're getting the redundancy.\n\n409\n00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,700\nWe've talked about it, there's another\nepisode where we talked about backups,\n\n410\n00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,990\nand this doesn't replace the need for\nbackups, but\n\n411\n00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:39,730\nit can make it where I don't need\nto rely on the backups as much.\n\n412\n00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,960\nI still wanna do a backup, cuz corrupt\ndata or deleted data is still corrupt or\n\n413\n00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,730\ndeleted, right,\nwhether I've got redundancy or not.\n\n414\n00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:51,160\nBut now if I have disk failure, I can pull\none of those disks out and replace it.\n\n415\n00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,250\nThere's a bunch of different ways\nyou can go about setting up a NAS.\n\n416\n00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,580\nYou can go buy these things out there,\n\n417\n00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,060\nyou can create your own\nwith the right software.\n\n418\n00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,980\nI'll show you a couple examples.\n\n419\n00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:06,350\nBuffalo is one that we used here\na couple of times at our work and\n\n420\n00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,390\nyou can see they've got\na couple of options.\n\n421\n00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,900\nIt's really, what you spend on\nthese is gonna be based on how much\n\n422\n00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:18,070\nstorage space they give you and what type\nof network adapters are built into them.\n\n423\n00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:23,780\nIf they've got multiple network adapters,\nor if you want gigabit versus 100MB,\n\n424\n00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,310\nor if you wanted to go fiber, some of\nthem will offer you a fiber module.\n\n425\n00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:31,390\nThose can affect the cost, as well as\nthe number of drives that are in there and\n\n426\n00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,150\nthe total amount of storage space.\n\n427\n00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,360\nLike here they've got a couple.\n\n428\n00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,090\nThey've got their LinkStation 400, which\nhas, it's one to two diskless enclosure.\n\n429\n00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,850\nSo that means if I buy this,\nit's just the box,\n\n430\n00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,670\nthere is no hard drives in there, I'm\ngoing to have to fill the hard drives up.\n\n431\n00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:51,970\nSomething to keep in mind when you go buy\nthem, I had people say, I bought this NAS,\n\n432\n00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,960\nI only spent a couple hundred bucks on it.\n\n433\n00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,680\nLike, really?\n\n434\n00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,710\nThat's a good price.\n\n435\n00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,620\nThey get it in, and\nit's just the box and the software.\n\n436\n00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,740\nThere's no hard drives in there.\n\n437\n00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,460\nThey have to go and then buy\nthe hard drives to put in there, and\n\n438\n00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,870\nnow they're right up to the same price\nas if they hadn't bought the thing.\n\n439\n00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,670\nBut Buffalo makes a few of them.\n\n440\n00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,600\nAnother one is Drobo.\n\n441\n00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,670\nThis is a really popular one.\n\n442\n00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,990\nThey've got some really nice features.\n\n443\n00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,510\nAgain, you can choose different sizes,\ndifferent capabilities.\n\n444\n00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:23,100\nBut what these guys do is, internally they\nrun software that's very similar to RAID.\n\n445\n00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,640\nThe redundant array of inexpensive disk,\n\n446\n00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:31,100\nwhich is just a way that I can take that\ndata and spread it across multiple drives.\n\n447\n00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,890\nThat way if any one drive fails,\nI don't lose all my data.\n\n448\n00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,530\nAll I have to do is pull that drive out,\nreplace the drive.\n\n449\n00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:41,470\nIt can figure out from what's\nleft on the other drives,\n\n450\n00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:44,320\nit can figure out what's missing,\nand it can put it back.\n\n451\n00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,120\nIt's really impressive stuff, but\nit's all behind the scenes to us.\n\n452\n00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,210\nAll we do is we buy one of these devices,\nwe fill it with hard drives,\n\n453\n00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,540\nwe plug it into our network, and\nwe start storing data on there.\n\n454\n00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,525\nAnd they make life really nice.\n\n455\n00:23:56,525 --> 00:24:00,440\n>> Yeah, that's the really important\nfeature here that we're talking about.\n\n456\n00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,350\nWith these types of devices\nthey're basically plug and play.\n\n457\n00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,980\nYou just plug them in, you turn them on,\nand they start to work.\n\n458\n00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,792\nYou don't have to know everything about\nRAID and which RAID version should you be,\n\n459\n00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:13,059\nRAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 10,\nall the other RAIDs there are,\n\n460\n00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:14,800\nit's not a big deal for you.\n\n461\n00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,680\nAll you need to know is,\nplug it, in turn it on.\n\n462\n00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:23,220\nI see it in my list of attached devices\nand I can start uploading files.\n\n463\n00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:28,050\nI install some software that allows me to\nsee it, makes things really, really easy.\n\n464\n00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,828\nSo having one of these at home or\nin a small business,\n\n465\n00:24:30,828 --> 00:24:33,427\nthese are these are perfect for\nsmall business.\n\n466\n00:24:33,427 --> 00:24:38,125\nBecause I've got probably three or\nfour end users, maybe five to ten for\n\n467\n00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:40,050\nthe small business.\n\n468\n00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,910\nAnd they all have a nice,\nlarge disk that's being,\n\n469\n00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,817\nit actually has some redundancy to it.\n\n470\n00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:49,960\nIt's not a single point of failure\neven though it's a single device.\n\n471\n00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,130\nIt's got those multiple disks\nin there providing that service,\n\n472\n00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:56,980\nallowing you to have that redundancy,\nand they upload their files to it.\n\n473\n00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,950\nThey come back to work, or hey, so and\n\n474\n00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,560\nso, check out the file I've\nbeen working on, right?\n\n475\n00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,560\nThey open the file up,\nthere it is for them as well.\n\n476\n00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,491\nNot a big deal.\n\n477\n00:25:05,491 --> 00:25:07,440\nVery, very helpful, very simple to use.\n\n478\n00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,470\n>> Absolutely.\n\n479\n00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:12,410\nAnd if you wanna go the open source route,\nif you don't wanna spend as much money on\n\n480\n00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,150\none of these,\nthere's options out there as well.\n\n481\n00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,980\nI know David in our chat\nroom had mentioned FreeNAS,\n\n482\n00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,335\nthis is an open source software.\n\n483\n00:25:19,335 --> 00:25:22,650\nNow, you're gonna have to build your\nown device, but a lot of you might have\n\n484\n00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,880\na case laying around from\na computer that's no good anymore,\n\n485\n00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,885\nit's a little older or slower.\n\n486\n00:25:27,885 --> 00:25:30,830\nMaybe you wanna take that case and\nthrow a few hard drives in there and\n\n487\n00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,180\nmake your own NAS, right?\n\n488\n00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:36,308\nYou can download this software that'll\nallow you to do almost all the same things\n\n489\n00:25:36,308 --> 00:25:39,587\nthat those Drobos and\nthose Buffalo TeraStations would do, and\n\n490\n00:25:39,587 --> 00:25:40,997\ndo it on the cheap, right.\n\n491\n00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:45,267\nSo it's not your only solution,\nyou can do the less, I won't say free,\n\n492\n00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:46,880\nthe less expensive route.\n\n493\n00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,090\nCuz you have to have the case,\nyou still have to have the drives.\n\n494\n00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,660\nBut you can obtain the software and\n\n495\n00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,098\nyou can set up your own\nnetwork-attached stores.\n\n496\n00:25:54,098 --> 00:25:56,450\nSo lots of different options for\nyou out there.\n\n497\n00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,030\n>> So, Mike,\nI think that we've basically covered all\n\n498\n00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,620\nthe foundational knowledge that you would\nneed to know about redundant power,\n\n499\n00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,120\nredundant hardware, especially when\nit comes to those disks and storage.\n\n500\n00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,850\nVery helpful stuff.\n\n501\n00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:11,120\nThat being said, I guess we've\nwrapped up another great episode.\n\n502\n00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,880\nTime to sign off for ITProTV.\n\n503\n00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,940\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n504\n00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,850\n>> And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n505\n00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,700\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n506\n00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,420\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:13,900\nWelcome to another great\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,640\nI'll be your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n6\n00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,590\nHere with me today is Mike Rogers.\n\n7\n00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,430\nHow you doing today, Mike?\n\n8\n00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,920\n>> I'm doing fantastic, Daniel.\n\n9\n00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,240\nWe are getting ready to do another\nepisode of our Security Fundamentals.\n\n10\n00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,240\nAnd in this one we're gonna be\ntalking about physical security.\n\n11\n00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,950\nIt's one of those parts of security\nthat sometimes gets overlooked.\n\n12\n00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,240\nWe like to focus on\nthe electronic solutions and\n\n13\n00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,020\nthings I can do to my computer and things\nlike that, but when it comes down to it,\n\n14\n00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,810\nphysical security is a very important\npart of our overall security package.\n\n15\n00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,102\n>> Yeah, I guess there's something to be\nsaid about locking the old door behind\n\n16\n00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:45,860\nyou [LAUGH].\n\n17\n00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,220\n>> Microsoft, a long time ago, put out\nthese ten immutable laws of security.\n\n18\n00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,895\nAnd one of my favorite ones in there\nwas if I can touch your computer,\n\n19\n00:00:53,895 --> 00:00:56,099\nit's no longer your computer, right?\n\n20\n00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:58,967\nAnd that's basically because\nthere's too many things,\n\n21\n00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:02,827\nI'm not saying I'm a genius or anything,\nbut there's too many things I can do\n\n22\n00:01:02,827 --> 00:01:05,890\nif I can get access,\nphysical access to the machine, right?\n\n23\n00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,733\nI can take another operating system\nthat I have on a thumb drive, and\n\n24\n00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:13,690\nI can try to boot your computer\nto that other operating system.\n\n25\n00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:17,650\nOr I can just steal your computer and take\nit home with me and try something there.\n\n26\n00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:23,040\nOr steal the hard drive out\nof that laptop, for example.\n\n27\n00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,020\nSo physical security,\nif I can get access to that keyboard,\n\n28\n00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,330\nthat's a big part of it, and\nwe've got to make sure that we're.\n\n29\n00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,270\nAnd that's not the only part of physical\nsecurity, that's just one aspect of it.\n\n30\n00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,370\nPhysical security does encompass a lot of\ndifferent things, but it is, like I said,\n\n31\n00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,060\none of those things that sometimes\ngets a little bit overlooked.\n\n32\n00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,600\n>> Yeah.\n\n33\n00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,020\nI worked in enterprise\ncomputing solutions or\n\n34\n00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,980\nwhatever you want to call it a lot, and\nI used to tell people, they'd call and\n\n35\n00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,260\nsay, I've locked myself out of a computer\nand of course they're off the network.\n\n36\n00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,210\nI said, well, if you bring it in I\ncan break into it and then we can get\n\n37\n00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,830\nyou back going, but other than that\nit's gonna be a hard thing to do.\n\n38\n00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,680\nThey could bring me that computer,\n\n39\n00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,590\nI could, nine times out of ten\nI can get into that thing.\n\n40\n00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,600\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n41\n00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,170\nAll right, so\nwhen we talk about physical security,\n\n42\n00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,220\nfirst off, what is it,\nwhat does it involve?\n\n43\n00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,659\nWhat are we trying to do\nwith physical security?\n\n44\n00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:12,120\nAnd there's a couple of concepts here.\n\n45\n00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,780\nOne, just preventing unauthorized access,\n\n46\n00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,830\nwhether that's to the facilities or\nto an equipment room,\n\n47\n00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:24,050\nlike a server closet or something like\nthat, just gaining access to a facility.\n\n48\n00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,470\nThat's a physical intrusion.\n\n49\n00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,740\nSo that's part of our physical security,\n\n50\n00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,190\nis making sure that only authorized\npeople are allowed in the facilities.\n\n51\n00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,110\nAnd then again another layer of\nphysical security inside, or\n\n52\n00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,180\nmaybe my server closet, for example,\nhas another layer of security.\n\n53\n00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,300\nOr maybe you check out a laptop from your\ncompany that you use during the day, and\n\n54\n00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,640\nat the end of the day\nyou turn those back in.\n\n55\n00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,720\nAnd they go into a locked room,\nwhere if somebody can't just go and\n\n56\n00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,070\ngrab one of those laptops.\n\n57\n00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,740\nAnd another big aspect of it is trying\nto prevent damage to our resources,\n\n58\n00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,040\nas well as our personnel.\n\n59\n00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,600\nWe think about, some type of attack,\nlike a terrorist attack, or\n\n60\n00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,240\nsome crazy gunman, or something like that.\n\n61\n00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,800\nPhysical security can\nprevent that kind of thing.\n\n62\n00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,540\nAnd we see it in the news all\nthe time now with barriers.\n\n63\n00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,440\nAnd we'll talk about some of the different\nmethods we can use, but remember,\n\n64\n00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,290\nit's not just the resources, it's also\nprotecting our personnel as well.\n\n65\n00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,430\n>> Yeah, it's funny you say damage, right?\n\n66\n00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,380\nThat is something I think is\na lot of times overlooked.\n\n67\n00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,190\nThe fact that it's really easy to\ndamage some of the sensitive equipment.\n\n68\n00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,270\nThat's why we have server\nracks with cages around them.\n\n69\n00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,980\nThey've got doors with locks themselves.\n\n70\n00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,670\nThey're inside of another\nroom that's locked itself.\n\n71\n00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,830\nBecause what if I'm in there and I'm a\nlittle haphazard with a cup of coffee and\n\n72\n00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,740\nI slip, and I trip over, and\nthe coffee goes into the servers.\n\n73\n00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,000\nLast time I checked, coffee and\nservers don't mix very well.\n\n74\n00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,150\nThat whole electrical wet thing,\nnot a big fan of that [LAUGH].\n\n75\n00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,270\n>> Right, no, no.\nI don't\n\n76\n00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,670\nknow if you guys caught the other episode\nDon, I forget what episode it was, but\n\n77\n00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,890\nDon was telling an interesting\nstory about a data warehouse.\n\n78\n00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,220\nWhere they had done all of this\nsecurity on this data warehouse.\n\n79\n00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,030\nIt was top of the line, everything.\n\n80\n00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,480\nAnd some people actually ended up\ndoing a denial of service on them\n\n81\n00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,310\nby walking up to the building outside\nthe building, and took sticks, and\n\n82\n00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,630\nshoved them down into\nthe air conditioners.\n\n83\n00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,410\nBecause all their AC compressors were\nlined up outside of the building,\n\n84\n00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,450\nthey shoved sticks down in there,\nwhich stopped the fan from spinning.\n\n85\n00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,270\nAnd the temperatures rose through\nthe roof inside this warehouse and\n\n86\n00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,170\nall their servers go into\nthermal shutdown, right?\n\n87\n00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:26,755\n>> That's insane.\n\n88\n00:04:26,755 --> 00:04:28,210\n[LAUGH]\n>> They have fences now.\n\n89\n00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,820\nThey now have fences around their compound\nto prevent that type of physical access.\n\n90\n00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,270\nBut it's a great example of where,\nthis is a top of the line company,\n\n91\n00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,420\nmillions of dollars put\ninto this data warehouse.\n\n92\n00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,800\nAnd yet, they were still left\nout the physical security part.\n\n93\n00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,180\n>> Very, very interesting, right?\n\n94\n00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,300\nYou've got all this technology behind us,\nand\n\n95\n00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:53,000\nit's a stick ultimately that\nbrings servers to a grinding halt.\n\n96\n00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,240\nAnd it just takes a little\nbit of chicken wire or\n\n97\n00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,110\nwhatever, some chain link fence\nto keep people from doing that.\n\n98\n00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,640\n>> A little razor wire and\nyou're good to go.\n\n99\n00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,600\nSo physical security again is really\ntrying to prevent that unauthorized access\n\n100\n00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,810\nas well as preventing damage to\nour resources and our personnel.\n\n101\n00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,590\nNow when we look at these,\n\n102\n00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,510\nwe're gonna talk about something called\nsecure controls, the things that we put in\n\n103\n00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:18,240\nplace to provide this physical\nsecurity are known as controls.\n\n104\n00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,720\nAnd we can classify these\ncontrols in different ways.\n\n105\n00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,120\nOne of the ways I wanna classify\nthem is whether they're,\n\n106\n00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,250\nit really has to do with when they\ntake place in the event, if you will.\n\n107\n00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:34,130\nThey can either be preventive,\nwhich is gonna be before the event occurs.\n\n108\n00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:38,870\nThey can be a detective, which means\nthey're gonna do something during\n\n109\n00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,430\nthe event, or they can be corrective,\n\n110\n00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,420\nwhich means they're gonna be\ndoing something after the event.\n\n111\n00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,039\nAnd we can use any combination of, and\nwe really should, and most places will.\n\n112\n00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,095\nAnd some of the types of controls that we\ntalk about can actually go across those\n\n113\n00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:56,700\nboundaries, so they're not set in stone,\nblack and white.\n\n114\n00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,130\nIt's just a way to discuss\nthem a little bit easier.\n\n115\n00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,644\nSo when you're laying out security\npolicies and things like that, or if\n\n116\n00:06:03,644 --> 00:06:07,734\nyou're reading a security policy, this is\nhow we can classify this to make it easier\n\n117\n00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:12,082\nto discuss, whether they're preventative,\ncorrective, or detective, all right?\n\n118\n00:06:12,082 --> 00:06:16,687\nSo and then we can also categorize\nthem as how they're working,\n\n119\n00:06:16,687 --> 00:06:21,610\nlike physical, versus procedural,\nversus technical.\n\n120\n00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,080\nSo let's go through a few of them,\nand talk about how we would\n\n121\n00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,630\ngo about classifying, and it'll give\nyou some examples of a couple of these.\n\n122\n00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,910\nMost of them you're gonna be relatively\nfamiliar with because they're not,\n\n123\n00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,500\nit's a little different than some\nof the other things we talk about.\n\n124\n00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,690\nThese aren't specifically\ncomputer related, right?\n\n125\n00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:42,150\nWe're not getting into intrusion detection\nsystems, intrusion prevention systems.\n\n126\n00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,510\nIn fact, the first one I have\non my list is a fence, right?\n\n127\n00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,190\nI'm not going to pull\nup an image of a fence.\n\n128\n00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,200\nI think we probably all have a good\nidea of what a fence is, right?\n\n129\n00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,060\nBut that's a physical control\nthat I can put in place, and\n\n130\n00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,010\nthat would fall under\nthe preventive controls, right?\n\n131\n00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:04,030\nBecause that fence is gonna prevent them\nfrom gaining access to your facility.\n\n132\n00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,000\nSo a fence,\na door would be another example.\n\n133\n00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,970\nWe can throw a door with a lock on there.\n\n134\n00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,970\nThat's gonna prevent somebody\nfrom accessing that system.\n\n135\n00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,570\nAnd really, the door, they'll say\nthe door's that physical control, but\n\n136\n00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,208\nreally it's the keypad next to it, right?\n\n137\n00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,236\nOr the lock set that you put on there or\n\n138\n00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:27,060\nwhatever that's giving you\nthat preventative control.\n\n139\n00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,765\nA fire suppression system would be\nanother type of physical control.\n\n140\n00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:35,355\nThis is something I'm gonna install,\nI've got the pipes or\n\n141\n00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,075\nwhatever method we're\nusing to deliver this.\n\n142\n00:07:38,075 --> 00:07:42,155\nThat would be an example of\na corrective type control, right?\n\n143\n00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:45,970\nThe fire suppression system kicks in,\nafter the fire's started.\n\n144\n00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,420\nSo it's gonna correct the problem.\n\n145\n00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,237\nSo hopefully now you're starting to see\nthe difference there between preventative,\n\n146\n00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:54,125\nlike a door, prevents me from\ngetting access in the first place.\n\n147\n00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:57,303\nA fire suppression system is\ngonna correct the problem.\n\n148\n00:07:57,303 --> 00:08:02,036\nAnd really a fire suppression system could\nfall under Detective as well because it\n\n149\n00:08:02,036 --> 00:08:05,960\ndoes have to detect the fire first,\nI suppose, before it kicks in.\n\n150\n00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,830\n>> And\nwe gotta be careful when you do the fire\n\n151\n00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:13,650\nprevention systems obviously because\nyou don't want to use water, right?\n\n152\n00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,640\nBasically, the fire didn't do the damage,\nthe water's going to,\n\n153\n00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:22,410\nthat's why we have specific types of\nfire extinguishing systems that are for\n\n154\n00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,740\ntechnology based things,\nelectrical based systems.\n\n155\n00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,050\nSo probably wanna make sure\nyou implement one of those.\n\n156\n00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:27,880\n>> Absolutely.\n\n157\n00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,610\nYou don't wanna spread the water\nall over our computers.\n\n158\n00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,600\nIt's gonna be just as bad as Daniel's\ncoffee in that server closet.\n\n159\n00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,420\nSome other type of physical\ncontrol we might see in place,\n\n160\n00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:42,100\nsome that we might actually have used as\nan end user, would be like computer locks.\n\n161\n00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,770\nThis is something that we've really gotta\ndeal with especially if you travel.\n\n162\n00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,590\nYou take your computer with you.\n\n163\n00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,950\nYou're at this business\nmeeting all day long.\n\n164\n00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,700\nYou go back to the hotel, you drop your\nstuff off and you want to run down and\n\n165\n00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,580\ngrab a bite to eat or\ngo catch a movie or something like that.\n\n166\n00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,540\nWhat do you do with your laptop?\n\n167\n00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,590\nTypically, I don't know about you guys,\nthe hotels I stay in,\n\n168\n00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,390\nthey give you this little\ntiny safe about yea big.\n\n169\n00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:08,350\nAnd even my teeny tiny XPS Dell 12 inch\nwhatever is not gonna fit in that safe.\n\n170\n00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,205\nSo how do I secure that because I know\n\n171\n00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:13,915\nthat I don't have good security\nas far as the doors go, right?\n\n172\n00:09:13,915 --> 00:09:16,605\nThere's maids, there's cleaning crews,\nthere's management.\n\n173\n00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:18,275\nAny number of people can get in there.\n\n174\n00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:21,755\nI've been assigned a key to\na room where I've walked in and\n\n175\n00:09:21,755 --> 00:09:25,515\npunched my key in there, opened the door,\nand there's somebody watching TV.\n\n176\n00:09:25,515 --> 00:09:29,185\nBecause the person at the front desk\nhas misassigned the keys, right?\n\n177\n00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:33,110\nSo do I really wanna leave my\nlaptop laying on the bed there?\n\n178\n00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,000\nWhere you walk intentionally and get that.\n\n179\n00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,850\nSo a way I can control that would be, and\n\n180\n00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,460\nI got one on my screen if\nyou've never seen one here.\n\n181\n00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,790\nThis is what we call\na Kensington cable lock, right?\n\n182\n00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,730\nAnd most laptops will have a little\nplace where these will plug in,\n\n183\n00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,630\nthis one happens to be a combination.\n\n184\n00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,780\nThose are going to be key-based and\nthere's other brands as well.\n\n185\n00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,020\nThis is a pretty standard one, though.\n\n186\n00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,140\nAnd what's gonna happen is that's\ngonna loop around something and\n\n187\n00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,650\nthen lock to the side of that computer.\n\n188\n00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,570\nThere's a little port on the side\nof that computer, it has a bar, and\n\n189\n00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,550\nthis thing's gonna snap around it.\n\n190\n00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,240\nAnd that way ,if they try\nto steal your laptop,\n\n191\n00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,550\nthey're not gonna be able to get it.\n\n192\n00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,260\nNow, probably goes without saying,\nbut just to make sure,\n\n193\n00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,990\nyou don't wrap the other end of\nthat cable around a chair or\n\n194\n00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:21,470\na desk leg because I could easily pick\nup the chair and slide the thing off.\n\n195\n00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,160\nYou need to find something\nthat's firmly attached.\n\n196\n00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,330\nIn most hotels, that's not too difficult.\n\n197\n00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,830\nThe bed frame or\nthe TV is typically bolted in\n\n198\n00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:34,090\nbecause they're trying to provide\nphysical security on their device there.\n\n199\n00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,220\nSo we can take advantage of that.\n\n200\n00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,910\nFind something that's securely\nmounted that's not going to be easy\n\n201\n00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,090\nto slip the cable off of if you're\ngonna use one of those cable locks.\n\n202\n00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:46,780\nAnd that would be another\npreventative type control.\n\n203\n00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,790\nAnother system we see, and I see these all\n\n204\n00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:54,410\nthe time in the credit unions here\nin town, is gonna be man traps.\n\n205\n00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:57,250\nAnd now that we're gonna implement\none of these probably in our house.\n\n206\n00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,870\nBut just good to understand\nthis terminology and\n\n207\n00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,638\nyou might see it in your office space.\n\n208\n00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:05,800\nA man trap is another\ntype of physical security\n\n209\n00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,200\nwhere I can control that access,\nall right?\n\n210\n00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,170\nWe talk physical security,\n\n211\n00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,450\nwe're trying to prevent unauthorized\naccess to our building.\n\n212\n00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,100\nWell, if I've got a single door, and\n\n213\n00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,630\nsay it's got a keypad\nthat's associated with it.\n\n214\n00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,020\nSomebody can potentially get that\npin that's associated with that.\n\n215\n00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:25,000\nWatch somebody from afar with\nbinoculars as they punch the number in.\n\n216\n00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,330\nPossibly do some kind\nof tailgating attack.\n\n217\n00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,450\nAnd if you're unfamiliar\nwith that terminology,\n\n218\n00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,570\ncheck out our security\nfundamentals on brain cramp.\n\n219\n00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,840\nTheir social engineering, sorry.\n\n220\n00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,530\nWe'll talk about what\nthat means to tailgate.\n\n221\n00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:43,040\nBut in man trap as you see here,\nis it typically a double set of doors.\n\n222\n00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,990\nAnd what happens is when\nthat first door opens,\n\n223\n00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,540\nthat second door will not open\nuntil that first door closes.\n\n224\n00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,790\nAnd then depending on the security level,\nthey can have it set up in different ways.\n\n225\n00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,260\nLike in my credit union for\nexample, you open the front door,\n\n226\n00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,070\nyou walk in and once you walk in,\nthat door closes behind you.\n\n227\n00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,880\nThere's a metal detector in there\nthat you have to walk through.\n\n228\n00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,520\nAnd then the second door doesn't\nopen until somebody inside\n\n229\n00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,700\nactually pushes a button and\nreleases that door.\n\n230\n00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,250\nAnd that's gonna let me out.\n\n231\n00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,340\nAnd if they suspect anything,\nif I've got my hat pulled down low and\n\n232\n00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,160\nmy sunglasses on, and a big bulge for\nmy AK47 on the side here,\n\n233\n00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,180\nthey're not going to buzz me in,\nright, hopefully.\n\n234\n00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,900\nThey're not gonna open that second door.\n\n235\n00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,480\nI'm stuck inside this man trap\nuntil the authorities arrive.\n\n236\n00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,670\nI can't go anywhere.\n\n237\n00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,380\n>> Yeah, we see these a lot\nwhere there's anything valuable,\n\n238\n00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,760\njewelry stores tend to implement this\ntype of technology a lot, cuz well,\n\n239\n00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,820\nthey have some extremely valuable\nproduct behind those desks.\n\n240\n00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,850\nSo it's easy enough for\n\n241\n00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,680\nthem to just implement something\nlike that let's you in.\n\n242\n00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,030\nThey kinda give you the once over,\n\n243\n00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,560\nmaybe a metal detector,\nlike Mike was talking about.\n\n244\n00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,620\nAnd then, when they feel like everything's\nfine, then they'll let you in.\n\n245\n00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:57,070\nIt's just that one extra step before\nyou get to where are all the money is,\n\n246\n00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:57,618\nand all the good stuff.\n\n247\n00:12:57,618 --> 00:12:58,990\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Absolutely right.\n\n248\n00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,720\nYeah, and they can range from very simple,\n\n249\n00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,510\nlike the one at my bank has a simple\nmetal detector, and a visual look at you.\n\n250\n00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,090\nThey can be set up with communications,\n\n251\n00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,530\nthey might have somebody\nthat's in a different location\n\n252\n00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:13,250\nthat's monitoring a camera to decide\nwhether or not to let you in.\n\n253\n00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:18,140\nSeen some really high tech ones that\nactually have scales built into the floor,\n\n254\n00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,780\nand they will track you as\nyou enter the facility.\n\n255\n00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,280\nIt actually weighs you.\n\n256\n00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,640\nAnd as you come back out,\nit weighs you again.\n\n257\n00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,410\nAnd it compares.\n\n258\n00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,640\nAnd if there's a big difference there,\nthey know you might try to slip\n\n259\n00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,620\nsomething out, or\nmaybe you've slipped something it, right?\n\n260\n00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,570\nSo they can go from very simple to very\n\n261\n00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,990\nextreme depending on\nthe environment it's in.\n\n262\n00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,710\nOther things, physical controls,\ncameras are a big one, right?\n\n263\n00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,710\nThis is actually one that falls\nunder two of our categories.\n\n264\n00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,750\nThe first thing you think of with\ncameras is detective, right?\n\n265\n00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,670\nIt's gonna see what's going on,\nyou're gonna see the attack.\n\n266\n00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:56,080\nOr whatever it is we're detecting,\nand it definitely is a detective.\n\n267\n00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,360\nBut it actually can also be preventative.\n\n268\n00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,700\nAs Danny was talking about earlier,\nmaking a joke,\n\n269\n00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,150\nhe was like, I want to stab you, Mike.\n\n270\n00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,370\nBut then he looks around, and\nthere's cameras everywhere.\n\n271\n00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:11,930\nAnd he realizes that if he does stab me,\nthat he's going to be on film and\n\n272\n00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,410\nwill know who stabbed Mike.\n\n273\n00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,480\nThank goodness for me.\n\n274\n00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,350\nSo, there's an example of where control\ncan kinda fall under two different\n\n275\n00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,070\ncategories.\n\n276\n00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:23,565\n>> It's funny about the cameras is, you\ncan buy fake security cameras nowadays,\n\n277\n00:14:23,565 --> 00:14:24,150\nright?.\n\n278\n00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,320\nAnd just put them up around your home or\naround your business, they don't even do\n\n279\n00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,420\nanything, they just maybe have an LED\nin them with a wire that goes through\n\n280\n00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,710\nsome plaster and people think,\noh there's a CCTV camera around here.\n\n281\n00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,920\nI'm I'll just go try to do\nsomething to somebody else\n\n282\n00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,700\nbecause they think that there's cameras.\n\n283\n00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,590\nThat's why Mike says this is preventative.\n\n284\n00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:45,160\nPeople see those cameras and they think,\nI'm not getting on TV, I'm not gonna have\n\n285\n00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,520\nmy face plastered all over the 11 o'clock\nnews, cuz I tried to do a smash and grab.\n\n286\n00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,460\nAnd those, and\n\n287\n00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:54,810\neven fake ones that don't do anything were\nable to prevent that kind of activity.\n\n288\n00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,790\n>> A little battery in there with\na flashing LED and that's all it takes.\n\n289\n00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,930\nOh, why would the bad guy?\n\n290\n00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,550\nI got two houses here or\nI got two office buildings.\n\n291\n00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,330\nWhich one I'm gonna go to,\nthe one with the camera,\n\n292\n00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,470\nthe one without the camera, right?\n\n293\n00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,816\nI know most thieves are not intelligent,\nbut\n\n294\n00:15:07,816 --> 00:15:09,276\nI think most of them can figure that out,\nright?\n\n295\n00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:10,456\n>> Basic logic at that point.\n\n296\n00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:12,196\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n297\n00:15:12,196 --> 00:15:16,480\nAlarms would be another type of\nphysical control I can put in place.\n\n298\n00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,390\nThese would fall under my detective,\nright?\n\n299\n00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,100\nThey would detect the attack and\nthen the alarm would sound.\n\n300\n00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,760\nGuards would be another example of\nphysical security that actually falls\n\n301\n00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,320\nunder all three.\n\n302\n00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,690\nThey could be preventive because\nI'm less likely to attack someplace\n\n303\n00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,190\nwhere I see guards\npatrolling the facility.\n\n304\n00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:39,590\nThey're detective, guards have eyes and\nears so they could see or hear an attack.\n\n305\n00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,250\nAnd they're also corrective\nbecause in the event of attack,\n\n306\n00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,680\nan alarm goes off,\nthe guards can respond to that alarm and\n\n307\n00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,160\nthey can take measures to\ncorrect the situation.\n\n308\n00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,758\nSo they would actually fall\nunder all three of those.\n\n309\n00:15:51,758 --> 00:15:55,474\n>> They might even be the best form\nof physical security, because they\n\n310\n00:15:55,474 --> 00:15:59,711\nhave a human mind that they're able to\ndiscern things that a machine can't,\n\n311\n00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:04,290\nbecause machine just taking in information\nor sounding alarm, doing something.\n\n312\n00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:08,077\nIt doesn't have any A cognitive abilities,\nwhere that guard does.\n\n313\n00:16:08,077 --> 00:16:11,948\nThe guard can say well, this is a false\nalarm, and call off the dogs, and\n\n314\n00:16:11,948 --> 00:16:12,820\nall that.\n\n315\n00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,780\nOr the alarm should be going off right\nnow, and it's not, and then respond.\n\n316\n00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,630\nSo they could definitely\nbe one of your best forms.\n\n317\n00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,510\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n318\n00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:25,380\nAll right, and then we move on into\nmore of a procedural controls.\n\n319\n00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,650\nAnd procedural controls\nare going to fall under like,\n\n320\n00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,540\nincident response teams, right?\n\n321\n00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,110\nThis is where we have a procedure in\nplace, where if there isn't an event, of\n\n322\n00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,870\nsome security related event, then I have\na team in place that knows what to do.\n\n323\n00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,670\nThey're my first responders.\n\n324\n00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,130\nThey go in and secure the scene, and\n\n325\n00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,440\nsecure the evidence, or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n326\n00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,070\nThis is gonna be a corrective\ntype of a control, right?\n\n327\n00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,640\nThe incidence already occurred, so\n\n328\n00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,600\nthese guys are the ones that come in and\nfix the problem.\n\n329\n00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,680\nAnother one is security training, right?\n\n330\n00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,990\nThis is one that again,\na lot of people might not think about, but\n\n331\n00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,670\nthis is a preventative method.\n\n332\n00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:04,650\nIf I can teach my end users, how to keep\ntheir information, and their equipment in\n\n333\n00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,240\nthe facility secure, then I'm less\nlikely to have a breach, right?\n\n334\n00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,170\nIf I explain to somebody,\nhey, if you come in,\n\n335\n00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,760\nyou've punched in your keypad number\nthere, you've come into my facility,\n\n336\n00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,980\nor at your workplace, and now you realize\nyou forgot your briefcase out in the car.\n\n337\n00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,930\nSo you go ,and you prop that back door\nopen, while you run back to the car,\n\n338\n00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:28,370\nbecause you don't wanna have to enter your\nnumber in again, or something like that.\n\n339\n00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,800\nThat's obviously a huge security breach.\n\n340\n00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,180\nI had somebody tell me, but\nI had the door in view at all times.\n\n341\n00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:39,440\nThere's, nobody was able to slip in,\nin that time that I was out there.\n\n342\n00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,100\nI'm thinking to myself, now wait a second.\n\n343\n00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,560\nYou parked out there.\n\n344\n00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,520\nThe door's here,\nIf you propped it open and\n\n345\n00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,190\nthen walked out to your car, how did you\nhave your eye on that door the whole time?\n\n346\n00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,220\nUnless you walked to your car backwards,\nor\n\n347\n00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,610\nhad a mirror over your shoulder, you did\nnot have that door in view at all times.\n\n348\n00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,050\nBut they'll tell you things like that.\n\n349\n00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,885\n>> Their spider sense was tingling,\nI guess.\n\n350\n00:17:59,885 --> 00:18:05,010\n>> [LAUGH] So, by doing security training,\nby having meetings, lunch and learns.\n\n351\n00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,340\nIt's things like this,\nwhere I bring everybody together and\n\n352\n00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:12,430\ntalk about basic things that can\nhelp prevent security breaches.\n\n353\n00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,420\n>> Yeah.\nI've actually been\n\n354\n00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:17,350\na part of doing web based training, where\nwe gave you the information via a webpage.\n\n355\n00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,350\nAll you had to do was login,\nwatch the content training.\n\n356\n00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,310\nI don't think it took more than\na half an hour out of a busy day,\n\n357\n00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,405\nit sometimes can be a nice respite, right?\n\n358\n00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,090\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n>> Watch the security training,\n\n359\n00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,290\nlearn a thing or two, what you can do.\n\n360\n00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:34,400\nTo take some personal responsibility,\nto guard against a breach of any kind,\n\n361\n00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,040\nso it can be that way.\n\n362\n00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,570\nThen they take a little test, and so we\nknew they actually watched the video, and\n\n363\n00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,790\nthey learned something.\n\n364\n00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,920\nAnd they were able to\nanswer questions about it.\n\n365\n00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,960\nAnd then we knew, okay, this has given you\nsome of that basic understanding of what\n\n366\n00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,295\nyou can do as a user.\n\n367\n00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:52,480\nCuz security falls on all of us,\nnot just the IT guys, and the VPs, and\n\n368\n00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,760\nthings like that.\n\n369\n00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,160\nEverybody that walks through\nthe door of your company,\n\n370\n00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,240\nhas a part to play in the security,\nespecially the physical security.\n\n371\n00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,130\n>> Absolutely,\nyou can't stress that enough,\n\n372\n00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,000\nit's not just the security people\n>> It's you and\n\n373\n00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,320\nme that use the equipment,\nthat use the facilities.\n\n374\n00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,360\nI mean, they can put all the security\nprocedures they want in place, but\n\n375\n00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,730\nif I prop that back door open, leave my\nlaptop unattended somewhere, fail to lock\n\n376\n00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:22,370\nsomething, fail to log off my computer,\nthere's nothing they can do about that.\n\n377\n00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,820\nI've just blown a big old hole\nin my company's security policy.\n\n378\n00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,860\nAll right,\nwe talked about physical controls.\n\n379\n00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,400\nWe've gone over a couple procedural\ncontrols, technical controls.\n\n380\n00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,000\nThese are the ones that usually don't get\noverlooked, because as these IT guys,\n\n381\n00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,470\nthe geeks, you know, this is the fun part,\nthis is where we lock the system down, and\n\n382\n00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,590\ntry to prevent the bad\nguys from gaining access.\n\n383\n00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,270\nThis is gonna include things\nlike access control lists,\n\n384\n00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,780\nor fire walls, or auditing, right?\n\n385\n00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,085\nIf we take a look at say,\naccess control lists, this would be,\n\n386\n00:19:53,085 --> 00:19:55,895\nthis one's gonna fall\nunder my preventative.\n\n387\n00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,105\nBecause if you're not on the list,\n\n388\n00:19:58,105 --> 00:20:00,635\nthen you're not going to gain\naccess to that resource.\n\n389\n00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,565\nLogging on, user ID and\n\n390\n00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:07,765\npassword be another preventative type,\ntechnical control.\n\n391\n00:20:07,765 --> 00:20:11,285\nCuz if you don't have a password,\nyou can't log onto the system and\n\n392\n00:20:11,285 --> 00:20:13,615\ngain access, right?\n\n393\n00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:14,935\nFirewalls are another one.\n\n394\n00:20:14,935 --> 00:20:19,370\nIf you have firewalls or those things\nthat either run on an individual host, or\n\n395\n00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:23,670\nthey sit at the edge of my network or of\na subnet, and they control what types of\n\n396\n00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:28,930\ntraffic is allowed, to come in or go out\nof that particular portion of the network.\n\n397\n00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,520\nThis is another preventative type control,\n\n398\n00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,080\nbecause I can prevent certain\ntypes of traffic from coming in.\n\n399\n00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,090\nMaybe I don't want any traffic from\na particular subnet reaching this area.\n\n400\n00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,970\nOr from the public, or\n\n401\n00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:44,990\nfrom an IP range that I know that\nhas done attacks on us before.\n\n402\n00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,310\nSo there's many different ways.\n\n403\n00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:49,340\nAnd on your hosts, on your Windows box,\nor your Apple that you're sitting at,\n\n404\n00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,910\nyour most likely running a firewall.\n\n405\n00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:56,250\nAnd if you want to prevent people from\nusing Remote Desktop, or some other remote\n\n406\n00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,800\ncontrol protocol, you can block that\nprotocol at the firewall, right?\n\n407\n00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,840\nSo as another preventative type control.\n\n408\n00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,100\n>> Yeah, one of the cool things\nabout firewalls is that,\n\n409\n00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,890\nnot only do they block traffic coming up,\nbut\n\n410\n00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,570\nthey actually look at the traffic,\nto make sure that it's legitimate.\n\n411\n00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:14,410\nIt also falls under that detection\nthat Mike was about earlier.\n\n412\n00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:18,120\nIt will see and detect,\nwhether this is legitimate traffic,\n\n413\n00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,150\nso anybody's trying to\nskeeb into the backdoor.\n\n414\n00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:26,610\nThey're trying to ride the wave, as it\nwere, to get through maybe an open port.\n\n415\n00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,220\nAnd maybe that port is allowed,\n\n416\n00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,130\nmaybe even from a specific entity\nthat's outside of your company.\n\n417\n00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,080\nBut they might try to piggyback onto that,\nto get into your your business.\n\n418\n00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,910\nWell that firewall's actually gonna\nlook at that data, verify its validity,\n\n419\n00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,350\nbefore it actually allows it to come in.\n\n420\n00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,160\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n421\n00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,880\nSo really you can classify\na firewall then as preventative,\n\n422\n00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,680\nbecause I can choose what types\nof traffic is going in or out.\n\n423\n00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,010\nIt can be detective,\nbecause it can log events and\n\n424\n00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,160\nrecord what's been going in and out.\n\n425\n00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,100\nAnd it can be corrective.\n\n426\n00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,540\nIt can choose to close a port, or\n\n427\n00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:01,190\ndrop a protocol, based on what\nit's seeing in those packets.\n\n428\n00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,590\nSo very good, Dan.\n\n429\n00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,860\nAnother one I wanna talk about, you know,\nauditing would fall right in there as\n\n430\n00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,120\nwell, which is kinda what\nthe firewalls are doing.\n\n431\n00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,140\nIn fact, if you wanna back it up for just\na second, I'll show you guys a firewall.\n\n432\n00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,600\nI've got my Windows 8.1\nbox pulled up here.\n\n433\n00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,200\nAnd I've gone into my control panel,\nI've gone into my firewall.\n\n434\n00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,280\nAnd I can see I've got, you know,\ndifferent profiles that I can apply,\n\n435\n00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:25,270\nprofiles in a Windows-based system,\nallowing me to have groups of settings.\n\n436\n00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,220\nI have different security\nrequirements on my home network,\n\n437\n00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,610\nversus my corporate network,\n\n438\n00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:35,340\nmy work network, versus that network I\nconnect to at Starbucks or the hotel.\n\n439\n00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,710\nAnd Windows allows me to\ncreate what we call profiles.\n\n440\n00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,430\nSo, that I don't have to manually\nconfigure these settings every time.\n\n441\n00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:45,080\nBut basically, I can come in her,e and\nI can turn the firewall on or off.\n\n442\n00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,060\nI can go into some of my, actually,\n\n443\n00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:52,630\nI can say allow an app or\nfeature through the Windows firewall.\n\n444\n00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,980\nAnd I come in here, and I can pick and\nchoose which programs I want to allow, or\n\n445\n00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,100\nnot allow to go through that firewall.\n\n446\n00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,390\nAnd you can see, I've got private, which\nwould cover my home and my work networks.\n\n447\n00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,310\nAnd then I've got a public,\nwhich should be like Starbucks, or\n\n448\n00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,870\nMcDonald's, or the hotel,\nor what have you.\n\n449\n00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:12,370\nI come in here, and\nI can choose to allow or not to allow.\n\n450\n00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,410\nSo, this is a good idea to\ncome in here and check these,\n\n451\n00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,940\ncuz some of these rules can get turned on.\n\n452\n00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,330\nLike, I've never specifically allowed\nMSN Money, or anything like this.\n\n453\n00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,190\nIt was just probably the way\nit came set up from Windows.\n\n454\n00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,720\nAnd I might want to check those now and\nagain,\n\n455\n00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,600\njust to see what's being allowed\nto go through that firewall.\n\n456\n00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,650\n>> Yeah.\nOr if you install some new software,\n\n457\n00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,400\nand you got to get that thing as\nbeing blocked by the firewall.\n\n458\n00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,970\nThat's where you'd go to look that guy up.\n\n459\n00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,290\nYou'd say, oh, there it is.\n\n460\n00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,150\nAnd make sure you just hit that allow for\nwhatever profile it is you're using.\n\n461\n00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,430\n>> Yeah, Internet Hearts is not\nthe same without Internet access,\n\n462\n00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,292\nyou know what I mean?\n\n463\n00:23:43,292 --> 00:23:44,210\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n464\n00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:44,924\n>> All right, so\n\n465\n00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:49,028\nwe've got our technical controls, and then\nthe last type of control I want to talk\n\n466\n00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:52,485\nabout is actually compliance controls\n>> Not the most exciting,\n\n467\n00:23:52,485 --> 00:23:56,481\nthese are gonna fall under things like,\nsecurity policies, or\n\n468\n00:23:56,481 --> 00:24:00,412\nindustry regulations,\ncould be governmental regulations.\n\n469\n00:24:00,412 --> 00:24:03,248\nNow we've talked about security policies,\n\n470\n00:24:03,248 --> 00:24:06,311\nmost organizations All\norganizations should.\n\n471\n00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:09,530\nMost do have a security policy in place.\n\n472\n00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,550\nAnd this is gonna be,\n\n473\n00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,380\nit's gonna define what's allowed,\nwhat's not allowed on the network.\n\n474\n00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,490\nWhat I can use these devices for.\n\n475\n00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,720\nWho's allowed to use them and\nthings like that.\n\n476\n00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,900\nSo your company has gone through and\nthey've listed out a set of rules.\n\n477\n00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,760\nWell, this is a type of control\nthat I'm putting in place, right?\n\n478\n00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,020\nBecause when you get hired by\nthe organization, you typically had to\n\n479\n00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,920\nsit through that very boring, dry meeting\nwhere you're learning about the company,\n\n480\n00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,790\nand you're signing all this paperwork.\n\n481\n00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:39,090\nAnd you're signing these policies,\nbecause they're gonna say you've read and\n\n482\n00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,500\nunderstood our security policy.\n\n483\n00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,280\nSo, when you use their email system\nto send out invitations for your\n\n484\n00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,390\nkid's birthday party, and they come back\nand they say, unh-unh, that's not allowed.\n\n485\n00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,720\nYou can't say, I didn't know\nbecause you've already signed it.\n\n486\n00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,100\nIt's in that policy that you've\nsigned that you read it.\n\n487\n00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,000\nSo companies will have\nsecurity policies in place.\n\n488\n00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,980\nThere's industry regulations\nthat we have to deal with.\n\n489\n00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:05,500\nIf your organization Is in health care,\nor financial industry, or\n\n490\n00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,290\nsomething like that.\n\n491\n00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,150\nThere's things like HIPPA for\nmy health care industry.\n\n492\n00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:13,610\nThere's the Sarbanes-Oxley for\nmy financial industries.\n\n493\n00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,480\nThese are regulations that\nhave been in place to, again,\n\n494\n00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,560\nprovide that security over\nour information, our data,\n\n495\n00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,460\nto make sure we don't have unauthorized\naccess to those resources, right?\n\n496\n00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,680\nBut these aren't set by your organization,\nthese are set by,\n\n497\n00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,390\nthe industries got together and said hey\nthis is the way we need to do things.\n\n498\n00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:34,690\nOr it could be a governmental regulation\nwhere the government stepped in and\n\n499\n00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,670\nsaid hey you're a power plant, then you've\ngot to do this and this and this and\n\n500\n00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:41,850\nthis, to make sure people can't come in,\naccess that plant.\n\n501\n00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,550\n>> Yeah it is kind of funny how a lot of\n\n502\n00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:48,980\na private industry can affect\nthe entirety of the country.\n\n503\n00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,890\nWe have power grids here in United States.\n\n504\n00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:55,080\nWe've seen that kind of problem before\nwhere there was an issue with, well I\n\n505\n00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,820\nthink was a few years ago, there was one\nof the power plants in the mid-north,\n\n506\n00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,660\nand it went out and, basically, the top\n\n507\n00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,580\nquarter of the United States was without\npower until that grid came back on.\n\n508\n00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,890\nIt was really hard.\n\n509\n00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,180\nPeople in New York, they lost power.\n\n510\n00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,900\nPeople in Chicago, they lost power.\n\n511\n00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,850\nAll these people were without power\nbecause they didn't do something that they\n\n512\n00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,830\nwere supposed to do, and that's why\nthey have these type of regulations.\n\n513\n00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:22,000\nTo make sure you are following\nsafe procedure because\n\n514\n00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,430\nyou don't just affect you, right?\n\n515\n00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:27,380\nIt doesn't just affect your profits\nbecause you were horrible and\n\n516\n00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,840\ndidn't follow the right procedure and\neverybody lost power.\n\n517\n00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,160\nIt affects everyone if our government\nsystems are on this type of power.\n\n518\n00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,120\nIf we don't have backup against\nthis type of power loss,\n\n519\n00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,270\nwe would be in a lot of trouble.\n\n520\n00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,260\nSo you've gotta watch out for\nthese things.\n\n521\n00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,270\nAnd if you're in those kind of businesses,\n\n522\n00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,520\nyou're gonna run up\ninto these stuff a lot.\n\n523\n00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,190\nEspecially the HIPAA kind,\nthey don't play around with that.\n\n524\n00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,440\n>> They do not.\nAll right, so\n\n525\n00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,760\nagain to break physical\nsecurity down again,\n\n526\n00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,040\nwe wanna just make sure we understand\nphysical security is not just a fence.\n\n527\n00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:02,890\nBut physical security is designed to\nprevent access to your facilities and\n\n528\n00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:07,840\nto your resources, and prevent damage\nto my facilities, my resources,\n\n529\n00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,470\nand us being a resource as well.\n\n530\n00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,920\nAnd I've got different types of\ncontrols that we can put in place.\n\n531\n00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,730\nWe can categorize those controls\nas either being preventative,\n\n532\n00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,860\ntrying to prevent the event\nin the first place.\n\n533\n00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,240\nThey can be detective.\n\n534\n00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,800\nThey can detect the event\nas it's occurring.\n\n535\n00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,250\nOr they can be corrective.\n\n536\n00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,530\nThey can try to fix something\nafter the event has occurred.\n\n537\n00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:32,210\nAnd as we saw, they can also fall into\nmore than one of those categories, right?\n\n538\n00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:37,760\nCameras for example, can be preventative\nas well as detective, right?\n\n539\n00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,640\n>> Always better to be proactive\ninstead of reactive if you can\n\n540\n00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,060\npossibly get away with that.\n\n541\n00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,800\n>> Exactly, and then we gave you a whole\nlist of examples of different types of\n\n542\n00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,680\nphysical security controls, and\nwhat categories they fell under so.\n\n543\n00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,502\nThen Daniel, I think there's a real good\nlook at what physical security involves.\n\n544\n00:27:56,502 --> 00:27:59,528\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And it's an important part of security\n\n545\n00:27:59,528 --> 00:28:03,412\nthat we cannot underestimate or\ntake for granted.\n\n546\n00:28:03,412 --> 00:28:07,582\nAnd we've got to realize that you and\nI, the every day end-user,\n\n547\n00:28:07,582 --> 00:28:09,380\nare a big part of it, right?\n\n548\n00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,890\nWe're not talking to the IT guys and\ngals, and things like that.\n\n549\n00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,790\nTalking about everybody is a part of it.\n\n550\n00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,920\nPhysical security is one of those things\nwhere we've all gotta pitch in and help.\n\n551\n00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,680\n>> Yep.\nWell said, Mike.\n\n552\n00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,500\nWell said.\n\n553\n00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,920\nHopefully you guys learned\na lot watching this video.\n\n554\n00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,260\nWe sure hope you did.\n\n555\n00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,460\nWe sure had a lot of fun times making it.\n\n556\n00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:29,060\nThat being said, we have come to\nthe end of another great episode, and\n\n557\n00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,130\nit is time to sign off.\n\n558\n00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,240\nI've been you're host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n559\n00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,020\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n560\n00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,912\n>> And we'll

gonna be your host, Mike Rodrick,\nand with me today is Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n4\n00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,030\nHow you doing, Don?\n\n5\n00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,260\n>> I'm doing great Mike.\n\n6\n00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,306\nIn this episode we're gonna move\ninto a commonly misunderstood topic,\n\n7\n00:00:23,306 --> 00:00:24,841\nwhich is risk assessment.\n\n8\n00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:29,470\nAnd really when you're talking about IT\nsecurity and really just a fundamental\n\n9\n00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,073\npractice in security,\nrisk assessment is a big part of that.\n\n10\n00:00:33,073 --> 00:00:36,337\nSo we're going to spend some time\ntalking about how risk collection works,\n\n11\n00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:38,540\nhow you analyze risk and\ndetermine your solution.\n\n12\n00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,300\nWhat you're gonna do about\nthe risks that you find.\n\n13\n00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,600\nSo it's pretty good stuff.\n\n14\n00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,150\n>> Yeah because we really got to\nunderstand what it is we're dealing\n\n15\n00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,730\nwith right.\n\n16\n00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,659\nIf we want to protect our systems,\n\n17\n00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:49,993\nwe've got to understand what\nthreats face those systems.\n\n18\n00:00:49,993 --> 00:00:52,992\nAnd we're got to decide how much we're\nwilling to spend to protect those kind of\n\n19\n00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,860\nthings, and that's really what\nrisk management is all about.\n\n20\n00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,980\n>> Yeah, it really is, and\nI say it's misunderstood.\n\n21\n00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,180\nRisk is just a really big field.\n\n22\n00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,440\nThere's so\nmuch stuff that falls under risk.\n\n23\n00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,230\nMost of the universities\nhere in the United States,\n\n24\n00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,680\nyou can actually get a master's\ndegree in risk management.\n\n25\n00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,238\nIt's that big of a topic,\nso there's a lot to it.\n\n26\n00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:16,955\nAs a IT security person, or just\nsomebody who uses computers in general,\n\n27\n00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:20,011\nyou know that your data's\nat risk all the time.\n\n28\n00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:22,983\nAnd that means that there's outside forces\nthat might be trying to gain access to\n\n29\n00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:23,780\nyour systems.\n\n30\n00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,620\nThere's accidents that you could make\nthat expose data even if people weren't\n\n31\n00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,432\nlooking for it.\n\n32\n00:01:28,432 --> 00:01:32,252\nAnd then there's just random occurrences\nthat can happen, things like\n\n33\n00:01:32,252 --> 00:01:37,080\nnatural disasters, earthquakes,\nhurricanes, floods, stuff of that nature.\n\n34\n00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,440\nThose are all things that could\noccur that could impact the security\n\n35\n00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,880\nof your environment.\n\n36\n00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,310\nAnd so we've gotta have a good\nunderstanding of what's out there so\n\n37\n00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,530\nwe can determine a plan.\n\n38\n00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,560\nThat's part of what information\nsecurity is all about, is not so\n\n39\n00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,420\nmuch reacting to what's going on,\nbut being proactive and\n\n40\n00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:02,270\nhaving plans in place to stop or be able\nto handle issues when they do occur.\n\n41\n00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,860\nAnd that all starts with risk analysis.\n\n42\n00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:10,145\nNow with risk analysis, we basically look\nat what's out there in the environment,\n\n43\n00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:13,385\nand we try and figure out what\nour risks are, right, Mike?\n\n44\n00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:16,915\n>> Exactly, so things like hurricanes,\nfor example, here in Florida,\n\n45\n00:02:16,915 --> 00:02:18,345\nthat could be a very big risk.\n\n46\n00:02:18,345 --> 00:02:21,925\nIf I live up in northern Canada,\nmaybe not so much of a risk.\n\n47\n00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:23,085\nIs that we're talking about here?\n\n48\n00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:24,725\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n49\n00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:26,485\nEverybody has different risks.\n\n50\n00:02:26,485 --> 00:02:29,610\nI can't give you guys a list, like,\nhere you go, these are your risks.\n\n51\n00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,780\nThere's some that we all have in common,\nright?\n\n52\n00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,140\nIf your company is connected to\nthe Internet, you've got a common risk,\n\n53\n00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,820\nthe same risk we have here at ITProTV.\n\n54\n00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,180\nThat outside people,\n\n55\n00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,990\nunauthorized personnel, could break\ninto your network and access your data.\n\n56\n00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,730\nBut even that common risk is different.\n\n57\n00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:51,120\nHere at ITProTV, if somebody were to break\ninto our network they'd get our episodes.\n\n58\n00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,330\nWe don't have any customer\ndata here in the building,\n\n59\n00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,980\nwe don't have any financial data.\n\n60\n00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,850\nWe all might have credit cards in our own\nwallets, but not on our computer systems.\n\n61\n00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:04,534\nSo the risk for us is there but\nwhat's called the impact, right.\n\n62\n00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:06,892\nThe impact is how damaging\nthat risk could be.\n\n63\n00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:08,930\nThe impact for us is very minimal.\n\n64\n00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,160\nBut if you're a hospital or\na financial institution like a bank and\n\n65\n00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,830\nsomebody breaks into your network and gets\nthose records, well, that's a big deal.\n\n66\n00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,800\nYou've got to disclose that, you've got to\nlet your people know, your customers know,\n\n67\n00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,040\nthat their data was compromised,\nand it's a huge PR debacle.\n\n68\n00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,740\nSo when we take a look at a risk, it's not\njust identifying that the risk exists,\n\n69\n00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,500\nbut figuring out\nthe characteristics of that risk.\n\n70\n00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,040\nAnd in the risk world,\nthere's two words we have to remember, and\n\n71\n00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,090\nit's probability and impact.\n\n72\n00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,790\nEvery risk has a probability, right?\n\n73\n00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,410\nWhat are the odds of that risk occurring?\n\n74\n00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,600\nAnd then there's the impact.\n\n75\n00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,020\nIf that risk does occur,\nwhat impact does it have on our company?\n\n76\n00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,130\nAnd so, that's what your security\nprofessionals are doing at your company,\n\n77\n00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,100\nis they're building up what\nare called risk responses that say,\n\n78\n00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,350\nif this risk occurs here's\nwhat we're going to do.\n\n79\n00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,230\nAnd they're categorizing those and\nranking them and doing all of this work.\n\n80\n00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,170\nAnd so in this episode I want to give\nyou guys kind of a preview of what\n\n81\n00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:05,990\nthat's like.\n\n82\n00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,207\nI don't want to go through the whole\nbureaucratic paperwork side of things.\n\n83\n00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,673\nI just want to show you what's going\nthrough the minds of the security\n\n84\n00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:14,227\npersonnel at your company, so\n\n85\n00:04:14,227 --> 00:04:17,296\nthat you have a better idea of\nwhy it is they have these plans.\n\n86\n00:04:17,296 --> 00:04:20,304\nAnd what is you're supposed to\ndo when something does go wrong,\n\n87\n00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:24,160\nwhich we'll talk more about in\nour business resumption episode.\n\n88\n00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,950\nBut for right now, let's look at just\nsome of these little characteristics.\n\n89\n00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,640\nSo Mike, if you work for an IT company,\n\n90\n00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,400\nwhat are some common risks\nthat you'd have to plan for?\n\n91\n00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,210\n>> The first thing I think about\nis like power outages, right?\n\n92\n00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,880\nBecause everything I do,\nmy network relies on power.\n\n93\n00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,700\nAll my routers, my switches,\nmy end systems, and things like that.\n\n94\n00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,810\n>> All right, so what I'm going to\ndo is I'm going to start writing\n\n95\n00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,670\nsome of these down.\n\n96\n00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,110\nWhen somebody's doing risk analysis, they\nbuild a document called a risk register,\n\n97\n00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,260\nand I've got an example of\na risk register right here.\n\n98\n00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,680\nIn the first stages of risk analysis,\nyou just sit around and\n\n99\n00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,490\nyou talk about what's out there.\n\n100\n00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,560\nWhat are the possibilities?\n\n101\n00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,260\nSo my first risk, the one that Mike\njust mentioned, was power failure, okay?\n\n102\n00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,480\nSo I'm just gonna kinda catalog\nthat power failure, all right, or\n\n103\n00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,840\nsome other risk that we have.\n\n104\n00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,981\nI mentioned natural disaster, right, we'll\ndo a hurricane, which I think I can spell.\n\n105\n00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:13,581\nIs it two Rs?\n\n106\n00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:16,002\nYeah, I guess so, so\nwe'll do the hurricane.\n\n107\n00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:16,562\nWhat are some other ones?\n\n108\n00:05:16,562 --> 00:05:18,241\n>> Some fire maybe.\n\n109\n00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:19,601\n>> Fire.\n\n110\n00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:20,320\n>> Let's see, what else?\n\n111\n00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,190\nWe got flood damage.\n\n112\n00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,070\nThat might go along with hurricane though,\nor something.\n\n113\n00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,650\n>> Yeah, and let's throw some\ntechnical ones in here, right?\n\n114\n00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,370\nLet's pump a few other things out.\n\n115\n00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,440\nSo we've got like,\npower failure, hurricane.\n\n116\n00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,901\nWe'll throw in hardware failure, right?\n\n117\n00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:39,345\nYou might have a hard drive or\npower supply die, a motherboard might die.\n\n118\n00:05:39,345 --> 00:05:43,344\n>> ISP failure.\n>> We might have an intrusion.\n\n119\n00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,190\nYeah we might have an ISP failure.\n\n120\n00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,640\nRight, so you wanna make a list.\n\n121\n00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,680\nAnd I've got enough room here for\nfive, so I'll stop at five.\n\n122\n00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,050\nBut it could be that you've got 100,\nthat you've got 1,000, right?\n\n123\n00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,990\nYour risk register could be very,\nvery big but for\n\n124\n00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,070\nthe sake of simplicity I'll\nkeep this one kind of small.\n\n125\n00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,080\nBut yeah, absolutely,\nyou could have break-ins and theft,\n\n126\n00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,570\nyou could have simple things like\nemployee calls in sick, right?\n\n127\n00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,630\nTake this show for example.\n\n128\n00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,130\nSo, Mike and I, we're here,\nwe're on the show.\n\n129\n00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,700\nIf Mike were to call in sick today,\nwhat would happen to the show?\n\n130\n00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,490\nIt would derail it.\n\n131\n00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,390\nI need some kind of plan in place.\n\n132\n00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,950\nWho's going to come in and\nstand in for Mike.\n\n133\n00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:21,550\nWho has as good hair as Mike, that could\ncome over here and be on the show.\n\n134\n00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,481\nSo, it's hard to line\nsomebody up like that.\n\n135\n00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:25,822\n>> [LAUGH] Thanks Don, I appreciate that.\n\n136\n00:06:25,822 --> 00:06:29,740\n>> So, these are the things that we have\nto plan for when we do risk analysis.\n\n137\n00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,290\nNow, it can even be things that\nare a little more outlandish.\n\n138\n00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,808\nI'm gonna add here, for risk five.\n\n139\n00:06:33,808 --> 00:06:37,470\nMeteor impact, right?\n\n140\n00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,540\nMeteor impact, that's a big deal.\n\n141\n00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,910\n>> There's definitely a possibility,\nand if that did occur,\n\n142\n00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,880\nI can imagine that would\ndo a lot of damage.\n\n143\n00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,400\n>> And with each of these risks\nwe're trying to think of two\n\n144\n00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,850\ncharacteristics of each one,\nthe probability and the impact.\n\n145\n00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,170\nProbability is how likely\nit's going to occur and\n\n146\n00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,360\nthe impact is how much damage it'll do.\n\n147\n00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,880\nNow damage is typically measured in money.\n\n148\n00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,910\nSo in terms of dollar signs,\nhow much money is this gonna cost you?\n\n149\n00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,180\nFor us here at ITProTV,\n\n150\n00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,200\nwe don't have any of our streaming servers\nright here in the building with us.\n\n151\n00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,660\nSo when you're watching this episode,\n\n152\n00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,200\nyou're actually not talking\nto our building at all.\n\n153\n00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,890\nSo if our building were to lose power,\nthe website would still be up,\n\n154\n00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,140\nyou could access the video on demand,\nthings like that, but other things,\n\n155\n00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,148\nlike our live feed might be down.\n\n156\n00:07:22,148 --> 00:07:24,780\nYou might not be able watch us live,\nbut you'd be able to watch us recorded.\n\n157\n00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,880\nSo there's a small impact created there,\nbut it's not that big.\n\n158\n00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,700\nMost of our customers won't be impacted,\nit's really not a big deal.\n\n159\n00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,430\nSo we take something like power failure\nfor us, the impact might only be a 1.\n\n160\n00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,120\nAnd I'm doing this on a scale of 1 to 5.\n\n161\n00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,160\nYou can use whatever scale you want.\n\n162\n00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,070\nI find a scale of 1 to 5 is\nthe easiest to get good answers.\n\n163\n00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,320\nThe bigger your scale,\n\n164\n00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,000\nthe more difficult it is to like\nactually assign a number to something.\n\n165\n00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,198\nSo I'm just saying, on a scale of 1 to 5,\na power failure for\n\n166\n00:07:52,198 --> 00:07:53,620\nus would be an impact of 1.\n\n167\n00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,493\nOther things though, like a hurricane.\n\n168\n00:07:57,493 --> 00:07:59,605\nA hurricane here in Florida is a big deal.\n\n169\n00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:00,778\nIt can cause power outages.\n\n170\n00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:02,015\nIt can cause floods.\n\n171\n00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,850\nIt can shut down roads.\n\n172\n00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:08,640\nThere was one year where I know that my\nmy house was out of power for six days.\n\n173\n00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,890\nAnd that's happened.\n\n174\n00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,040\nAnybody who's lived in Florida\na long time knows that's a reality.\n\n175\n00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,750\nThat's a big impact.\n\n176\n00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,940\nBut again, our our servers aren't here.\n\n177\n00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,490\nOur customers, they'd start to notice\nlike hey, the live feed's been down for\n\n178\n00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,430\nmultiple days now, that kind of stuff.\n\n179\n00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,740\nSo I might have to worry about that.\n\n180\n00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,140\nSo it is a bit bigger of an impact,\nI'm gonna move that up to a three for\n\n181\n00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,000\nthat one, all right.\n\n182\n00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,340\nWhat about hardware\nfailure in the equipment?\n\n183\n00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,890\nSo Mike, if the hard drive fails in\nyour laptop, how would that impact us?\n\n184\n00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,760\n>> We've got other laptops I can grab or\nsomething like that,\n\n185\n00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,040\nwe can always find something\nto use on the show.\n\n186\n00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,000\n>> Yeah,\nthat's that's a pretty low impact.\n\n187\n00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,650\nNow, it might cause us to be a little\nlate starting or something so\n\n188\n00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,720\nI might give that an impact rating of two.\n\n189\n00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,380\nRight, but it's just some kind\nof a minor inconvenience.\n\n190\n00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,460\nAn intrusion if somebody\nhacked into our network.\n\n191\n00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,340\nNow for us, because we don't have any\npersonally identifiable information,\n\n192\n00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,950\nactually I'm trying to think of what\nthey would get they broke in our studio.\n\n193\n00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,280\nNow, if they broke into\nour database servers, so\n\n194\n00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,110\nthat's a different story, those are in\na much more secure data center.\n\n195\n00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,870\nBut let's use that secure\ndata center as an example, so\n\n196\n00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,360\nif somebody managed to get into there,\nwhat could they get?\n\n197\n00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,450\nWell, we don't store credit card data so\nthere's none of that.\n\n198\n00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,650\nBut they can get names and\nemail addresses.\n\n199\n00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,710\nThat's a pretty big deal, right?\n\n200\n00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,650\nAnd nobody wants their name and\n\n201\n00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,350\nemail address distributed out\neven if that's all it is.\n\n202\n00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,035\nSo I might bump that up\nto an impact of four.\n\n203\n00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:32,805\nThat'd be a pretty heavy impact.\n\n204\n00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:37,135\nIf somebody managed to get that customer\ndata, that would be bad for the customers.\n\n205\n00:09:37,135 --> 00:09:38,425\nThey don't want that\ndata to get out there.\n\n206\n00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:40,765\nThat would be bad for us PR-wise, right?\n\n207\n00:09:40,765 --> 00:09:43,525\nAs far as public relations,\npeople would say, wow, these\n\n208\n00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:46,275\nguys are going to teach us about security\nand they can't even secure their own data?\n\n209\n00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:48,055\nThat would be pretty bad, right?\n\n210\n00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:51,525\nNow, meteor impact.\n\n211\n00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:56,900\nIf a meteor came down and\nhit this building, what would happen?\n\n212\n00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,470\n>> I would think that there'd\nbe a pretty large impact, right?\n\n213\n00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,187\nMost of us would no longer\nbe here able to shoot shows.\n\n214\n00:10:01,187 --> 00:10:02,960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All of our equipment's gone,\n\n215\n00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,240\ncameras, computers, personnel.\n\n216\n00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,280\nEverything's gone.\n\n217\n00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,580\n>> That's pretty big, right?\n\n218\n00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,090\nIn fact, of all of these, that's\nprobably the highest impact I've seen.\n\n219\n00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,490\nI'm gonna give that\nthe maximum rating of five,\n\n220\n00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,720\nI'm just gonna bump that\nall the way up to five.\n\n221\n00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,290\nNow, if I were to look at just impact,\nand I was a security officer, and\n\n222\n00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,090\nI was charged with coming up with plans.\n\n223\n00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,580\nI would look at this and say wow.\n\n224\n00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,555\nMeteor impact has an impact of five.\n\n225\n00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:26,175\nI need a plan for that.\n\n226\n00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,815\n>> That's where I'm going to spend\nall my money and all my time,\n\n227\n00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:30,925\ntrying to protect against meteor attacks.\n\n228\n00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:33,025\n>> But that would be really wasteful.\n\n229\n00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:37,375\nIt would be wasteful because the odds\nof that occurring are so low.\n\n230\n00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:41,665\nWhat are the odds of a meteor\nhitting this building or\n\n231\n00:10:41,665 --> 00:10:43,975\njust not burning up in atmosphere?\n\n232\n00:10:43,975 --> 00:10:48,215\nIt's so rare that a meteor actually\nhits the surface of the earth anywhere,\n\n233\n00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:50,020\nbetter yet this building.\n\n234\n00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,120\nSo statistically the odds are so\nlow that the probability for\n\n235\n00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,910\nthat really needs to be a one.\n\n236\n00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,896\n>> Like a 0.5 there?\n\n237\n00:10:57,896 --> 00:10:59,550\n[LAUGH]\n>> You really could lower it as low as you\n\n238\n00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,900\nwant, I'm doing a scale of one to five.\n\n239\n00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,140\nSo one would be the lowest,\nI'll leave it at one.\n\n240\n00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,250\nIf you start doing zeros, you have to be\ncareful cuz when you do the math on these,\n\n241\n00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,200\nyou can get like divide by zeros and\nstuff.\n\n242\n00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,660\nBut anyhow, on a scale of one to five,\nthat's definitely a one.\n\n243\n00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,840\nBut other things, like power failure.\n\n244\n00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,630\nWhat are the odds, on a scale of one\nto five, Mike, here in Gainesville,\n\n245\n00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,690\nwe have pretty decent power.\n\n246\n00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,650\nWhat what are the odds\nof power failing here?\n\n247\n00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,870\n>> I'm going to say there\nthey're relatively high.\n\n248\n00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,480\nI mean, within a month we're\ngoing to have one or two.\n\n249\n00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,420\nI know it's storm season coming up.\n\n250\n00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,230\nSo we've, in fact I think we had one\nthe other day where we had a power,\n\n251\n00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,070\na temporary failure.\n\n252\n00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,480\n>> Yeah, you get one of those little like\nbrown outs is enough to reboot equipment\n\n253\n00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,650\nand take the stream offline and\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n254\n00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,000\nSo we've got to have plans for\nthat in place.\n\n255\n00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,790\nThat's a pretty high likelihood.\n\n256\n00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,840\nI'm gonna go ahead and\ngive it a probability of three,\n\n257\n00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,570\nbecause it is really more like\na once a month type of thing.\n\n258\n00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,500\nIt's not a not an every\nsingle day type thing.\n\n259\n00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,300\nHurricane, right?\n\n260\n00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,630\n>> We get a lot of hurricanes in Florida,\n\n261\n00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,180\nbut not all of them\nreally hit us directly.\n\n262\n00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,200\nSo, maybe not quite so high?\n\n263\n00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,250\n>> Yeah, I'm gonna leave it at two.\n\n264\n00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,341\nNow, if you were to watch the Weather\nChannel, this would be a six, right?\n\n265\n00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:04,788\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're gonna be all killed by\n\n266\n00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:05,575\nhurricanes tomorrow.\n\n267\n00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:08,790\nThere's gonna be 20 hurricanes tomorrow\naccording, to the Weather Channel.\n\n268\n00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,720\nBut in real life, hurricanes really\naren't all that common in Florida.\n\n269\n00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,190\nWe're lucky to get one a year.\n\n270\n00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,685\nI shouldn't say lucky.\n\n271\n00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:15,185\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anyhow.\n\n272\n00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:16,660\nSo I'll put that one at a two.\n\n273\n00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,550\nIt can be a big impact, but\nit's just not that common an occurrence.\n\n274\n00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,110\nHardware failure.\n\n275\n00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,590\nAll right.\n\n276\n00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,880\nWith the amount of equipment\nthat we have here,\n\n277\n00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,080\nhow often do we see hardware failures.\n\n278\n00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,900\nPretty often, yeah, some of them.\n\n279\n00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,260\nLike on the servers, I know Mike, you\nhaven't had to fuss with some of those.\n\n280\n00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,150\nBut we've had a lot of\nhard drive failures there.\n\n281\n00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,750\nOn our laptops, maybe not so much.\n\n282\n00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,150\nBut yeah,\nwe've had some decent hardware failures.\n\n283\n00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,610\nI'm just gonna leave that\none of the three, though.\n\n284\n00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,400\nIt's not that common.\n\n285\n00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,330\nIntrusion.\n\n286\n00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,510\nLike I've got actual\nstatistics on this one.\n\n287\n00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,320\n>> Okay.\n>> I can tell you that our website is\n\n288\n00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,700\nattacked over a thousand\ntimes every single day.\n\n289\n00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,580\nSo we are constantly under attack and\nI don't think we're special.\n\n290\n00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,630\nI don't think we're being singled out.\n\n291\n00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,030\nI think that's pretty average for\n\n292\n00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:02,190\ncompanies that have web sites on\nthe Internet is that you get attacked.\n\n293\n00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,760\nAnd so that is a really,\nreally common thing.\n\n294\n00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,210\nThe probability for that,\nthat's really a five.\n\n295\n00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:12,290\nI mean, the odds of somebody trying to\nbreak into your network, it's a guarantee.\n\n296\n00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,140\nSomebody, they may not be specifically\ntargeting you right now, but\n\n297\n00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,670\nthey've got automated scans that\nare sweeping the Internet, looking for\n\n298\n00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,000\nsystems to compromise.\n\n299\n00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,440\nIt's basically a guarantee that you're\ngetting scanned right at this very moment.\n\n300\n00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,370\n>> And so with this number,\n\n301\n00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,850\nthen we're not really thinking about\nwhether they're successful or not,\n\n302\n00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,090\nit's just the attempts that are going on.\n\n303\n00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:29,765\n>> Right.\n\n304\n00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:32,380\nAnd, when you come up with\nthese risk ratings you're\n\n305\n00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,980\nthinking of this in terms of,\nif I do absolutely nothing to protect it.\n\n306\n00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,176\nRight?\nIf I do absolutely nothing to change this\n\n307\n00:13:41,176 --> 00:13:43,870\nthen, what's the probability\nof it occurring?\n\n308\n00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,900\nRight?\nSo if I were to take a computer and\n\n309\n00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,380\nplug it into the Internet with no\nfirewall, no antivirus, no anything like\n\n310\n00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,070\nthat, just plug it right in what\nare the odds of an intrusion happening?\n\n311\n00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:53,800\n>> A five.\n\n312\n00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,750\n>> It's a guarantee?\n\n313\n00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,030\n>> Yeah.\n>> And you will be compromised.\n\n314\n00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:00,770\nSo, we've got to take some kind\nof steps to protect from that.\n\n315\n00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,100\nNow, all we've done.\n\n316\n00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,990\nJust talking, Mike and I, kinda batting\nout numbers on a scale of one to five,\n\n317\n00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,050\nwe've done what's called\nquantifying our risk.\n\n318\n00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:13,150\nThis is quantitative risk analysis and\nwe're just assigning numbers to the risk.\n\n319\n00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,690\nAnd what the numbers do.\n\n320\n00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,060\nIf they give us a common point,\n\n321\n00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:21,130\nlike how do you compare a power\nfailure to a network intrusion?\n\n322\n00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,610\nIt's two completely different things.\n\n323\n00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,230\nIt's hard to compare those.\n\n324\n00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,960\nBut now that I've assigned probability and\n\n325\n00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,880\nimpact numbers to them, they have\nthe same type of characteristics.\n\n326\n00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,580\nI can compare them now.\n\n327\n00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:36,960\nAnd the way a risk analysis works is\nyou take that probability of impact and\n\n328\n00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,750\nyou can do it either way,\nyou can multiply the numbers together or\n\n329\n00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,410\nyou can do the average of the numbers.\n\n330\n00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,220\nI like to do the averages because\nit's a little more meaningful to me.\n\n331\n00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,900\nAnd when you do the average of the numbers\nyou end up with a risk rating.\n\n332\n00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,280\nHow significant is that risk?\n\n333\n00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,340\nAnd this risk rating is really important,\n\n334\n00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,700\nbecause you might a risk\nlike meteor impact.\n\n335\n00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,100\nIt's going to impact a five.\n\n336\n00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,670\nIt would devastate my company\nif this was hit by a meteor.\n\n337\n00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,660\nAll right?\n\n338\n00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,620\nBut that probability,\n\n339\n00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,650\nit's so unlikely to happen that it\ndrags the risk rating down to a three.\n\n340\n00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:12,130\nIt brings that down to a level of three,\nso it's much less likely to occur.\n\n341\n00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:17,870\nI don't need to focus on that as much as I\nwould something like a network intrusion.\n\n342\n00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:22,130\nA network intrusion, because it's a\nprobability of five and an impact of four,\n\n343\n00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,110\nthat get's a 4.5,\nthat's a really high rating.\n\n344\n00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:29,410\nI need to worry about that,\nI need to have plans in place for that.\n\n345\n00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,450\nAll right, and that's what this comes\ninto play with, these risk ratings.\n\n346\n00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,050\nThat's the qualitative\nanalysis side of this thing.\n\n347\n00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,730\nWe've qualified all of our risks.\n\n348\n00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,570\nNow we can compare them together and\nfigure out which ones we need to plan for.\n\n349\n00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,430\nSome, we don't need to plan for as much.\n\n350\n00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,350\nOthers, we do and we see that right here.\n\n351\n00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,830\n>> So, that kind of gives\nus an order of importance,\n\n352\n00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:53,010\nthen, in and dealing with these different\nrisks and how we should process them.\n\n353\n00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,130\n>> That's exactly what it is.\n\n354\n00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,324\nAnd what a risk manager will\nnormally do is take this and\n\n355\n00:15:56,324 --> 00:15:57,715\nthen plot it out on a little chart.\n\n356\n00:15:57,715 --> 00:16:00,616\nSo what what I've been showing\nyou here is a risk register.\n\n357\n00:16:00,616 --> 00:16:03,880\nI'm registering or\nlisting all of my risks.\n\n358\n00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,805\nAnd then they'll build a risk matrix,\nthis guy right here.\n\n359\n00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:13,110\nAnd what a risk matrix does is it lays\nout all the risks on a little chart.\n\n360\n00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,490\nJust kind of plotting them out.\n\n361\n00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,500\nAnd see how I have meteor impact way\nup here, hurricane, hardware failure,\n\n362\n00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,150\npower failure, intrusion, and\nthen we just kind of draw a line.\n\n363\n00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,740\nAnd we say, anything that crosses\nthat line, we need to plan for.\n\n364\n00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,580\nAnything below the line, we don't.\n\n365\n00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,290\nSo, power failure is below this line.\n\n366\n00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,230\nIt's below the line, so I might say, hey I\nknow power failures happen once a month,\n\n367\n00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,270\nbut I don't really need to spend\na lot of effort working on that.\n\n368\n00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,340\nBut intrusions, way over here,\n\n369\n00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,210\nway past the line,\nthat's something I do need to worry about.\n\n370\n00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,310\nI need to plan for that, all right?\n\n371\n00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:48,500\nNow, meteor impact, because of its\naverage, it kind of ended up above that\n\n372\n00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,060\nline, too, which really,\nI should probably move my line a bit.\n\n373\n00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:57,000\nBut the way this is kinda laid out, we can\nget an idea of which of the risks that we\n\n374\n00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,120\nreally need to plan for\nand work around, right?\n\n375\n00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,950\nSo once we have this data,\nnow we start looking for solutions.\n\n376\n00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,922\nAnd there's four different approaches\nwe can take these risks once we've\n\n377\n00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:13,781\nfound them, and determined which\nones we're going to handle, right?\n\n378\n00:17:13,781 --> 00:17:15,800\nCompanies, they have to\nfigure what they're gonna do.\n\n379\n00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,220\nSo if I know I need to deal with\nthis intrusion detection, right?\n\n380\n00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,320\nI'm worried about that,\nI don't wanna lose my customer data.\n\n381\n00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,400\nWhat do I do?\nThere's four things, okay.\n\n382\n00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,230\nLet me just run over them,\nwe'll talk about each one.\n\n383\n00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,910\nWe can mitigate the risk.\n\n384\n00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,610\nWe could transfer the risk.\n\n385\n00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:36,080\nWe can avoid the risk or\nwe can accept the risk.\n\n386\n00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,770\nEach one has a different strategy for\nhandling the risk, right.\n\n387\n00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,280\nLet's start with mitigate.\n\n388\n00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,940\nMitigating the risk means I want to\nreduce the odds of it occurring.\n\n389\n00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,340\nOkay, so,\nif I'm talking about a network intrusion,\n\n390\n00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,780\nhow can I reduce the odds\nof that occurring?\n\n391\n00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,270\n>> We can use better firewalls,\n\n392\n00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,400\nwe can use better authentication methods,\nand things like that.\n\n393\n00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,138\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n394\n00:17:57,138 --> 00:17:59,237\nAnti-virus, firewalls,\n\n395\n00:17:59,237 --> 00:18:03,750\nanti-malware, intrusion detection systems,\nkey card access,\n\n396\n00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,950\nall the security controls that we talked\nabout in the other episodes of the series.\n\n397\n00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,260\nThose are all things\nthat help to mitigate,\n\n398\n00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,990\nto reduce the odds of that risk occurring.\n\n399\n00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:16,645\nWe're taking some kind of active action.\n\n400\n00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:18,770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're taking some kind of actions,\n\n401\n00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,870\nsome proactive means to make sure the risk\ndoesn't happen in the first place.\n\n402\n00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,650\nNow, the risk might still happen.\n\n403\n00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,750\nNo matter how much\neffort you put in there,\n\n404\n00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,340\nsomebody out there might\njust be smarter than you.\n\n405\n00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,890\nAnd they get in.\n\n406\n00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,150\nAnd now you've got to do a risk response,\nright?\n\n407\n00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,270\nYou've gotta react and\nit takes some action.\n\n408\n00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,900\nBut mitigating is trying to prevent the\nrisk from happening in the first place.\n\n409\n00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,190\n>> So really we're reducing that\npossibility is what we're ending up doing.\n\n410\n00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,340\n>> That's exactly it,\nyou reduce the probability and\n\n411\n00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,400\nthat changes that risk's characteristics.\n\n412\n00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:51,090\nYou can also do the next one,\nwhich is risk avoidance.\n\n413\n00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,320\nWhere we say, okay, if I'm worried\nabout a hacker on the Internet getting\n\n414\n00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,810\ninto my system,\nI just won't plug into the Internet.\n\n415\n00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:00,330\nIf I'm not plugged into the Internet\nthey can't get in that way,\n\n416\n00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,460\nI just avoided the risk.\n\n417\n00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,770\nI didn't reduce the probability,\nI eliminated the probability,\n\n418\n00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,195\nit's not going to happen, right?\n\n419\n00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:11,590\nAnd when it's something like a,\nI use an example of an outdoor wedding.\n\n420\n00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,230\nI'm gonna have an outdoor wedding,\nwell it might rain, that's a risk.\n\n421\n00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,811\nAll right, well forget that, I'll have\nan indoor wedding, we just avoided it.\n\n422\n00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:22,171\n>> But if your heart was set on\nhaving that outdoor wedding,\n\n423\n00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:24,912\nwhich I wouldn't\nnecessarily care about it.\n\n424\n00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:27,951\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But if your heart was set on Internet\n\n425\n00:19:27,951 --> 00:19:31,138\nservice, I wanna host a website,\nthen is saying I'm gonna,\n\n426\n00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:35,420\nthat you're gonna disconnect from\nthe Internet, is that even a possibility?\n\n427\n00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,000\n>> It's not really gonna work\nout too well for you is it?\n\n428\n00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,990\n>> It isn't.\n\n429\n00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,810\nSo, risk avoidance doesn't always work,\nright?\n\n430\n00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,790\nIt's just not always possible.\n\n431\n00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:46,798\nSo, while it's great, it's 100% guaranteed\nthat risk is not going to occur,\n\n432\n00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:48,161\nit's not always an option.\n\n433\n00:19:49,761 --> 00:19:52,840\nRisk transference is another one.\n\n434\n00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,020\nTransference is you say, okay, look,\nI don't know to handle this risk.\n\n435\n00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,800\nI know it's there,\nI just don't have the means or whatever.\n\n436\n00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,010\nSo instead, I'm gonna transfer\nthe risk to somebody else.\n\n437\n00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,180\nInstead of me dealing with it, I'm gonna\nget them to deal with it, all right?\n\n438\n00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,070\nNow I know that sounds like,\nwho would let you do that?\n\n439\n00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,310\nWell, it's these people\ncalled insurance companies.\n\n440\n00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,090\n>> Yeah, there's people out\nthere that do that for us.\n\n441\n00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,051\nThat's their whole job,\nis to take that risk from us.\n\n442\n00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:18,635\n>> And while it sounds risky for\nthem to do that,\n\n443\n00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,770\nboy do they make some money, right.\n\n444\n00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:21,710\nYes they do.\n\n445\n00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,073\nInsurance companies make tons of money\nbecause they look at the odds and\n\n446\n00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:27,640\nthey say, okay, I'm going to insure you.\n\n447\n00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,515\nIf hackers break into your system,\nI'm gonna give you a $5 million bond,\n\n448\n00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:35,800\nand if they break in,\nI'll give you $5 million.\n\n449\n00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,930\nAnd you can use that to wage a PR campaign\nto get your company back in a better\n\n450\n00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:43,190\nlights and beef up your security\nto do all this stuff if it occurs.\n\n451\n00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,920\nIf it doesn't occur,\n\n452\n00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:49,080\nthough, you're paying that insurance\npolicy month after month after month, and\n\n453\n00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,410\nwhen it doesn't occur, insurance companies\nare just sticking that in their pocket.\n\n454\n00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,750\nAd that's money they made.\n\n455\n00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,200\nThey make that money because\nthey're assuming the risk from you.\n\n456\n00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,430\nRight, that's the trade-off.\n\n457\n00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,780\nWe do this with car insurance and\nmedical insurance.\n\n458\n00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,780\nYou're saying, I don't know if I'm\ngoing to get hurt anytime soon.\n\n459\n00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,650\nWell, they're like, I haven't had to go to\nthe doctor in probably three years now, so\n\n460\n00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:11,340\nfor the last three years I've been\npaying for medical insurance.\n\n461\n00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,540\nNever used it, not a single time.\n\n462\n00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,510\nThe insurance company puts\nthat in their pockets, right.\n\n463\n00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:19,600\nBut somewhere out there is\nsomebody who got sick, and\n\n464\n00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,760\nthey were in the hospital for weeks.\n\n465\n00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,850\nAnd they racked up more medical bills\nthan the interest they'd paid in\n\n466\n00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,060\ntheir entire life.\n\n467\n00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:30,140\nAnd so the insurance company lost money\non them, but they made money on me.\n\n468\n00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,430\nAnd that's how insurance companies work.\n\n469\n00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,350\nSo that's why we're\nable to transfer risks.\n\n470\n00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,560\nAnd risk transference is almost\nalways in the form of insurance.\n\n471\n00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,660\nBut it could also be in the form\nof contracting, we do that, right?\n\n472\n00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,170\nOur website could get hacked into.\n\n473\n00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,610\nThat's a real problem, right?\n\n474\n00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,840\nWell, if Mike and\nI had had time to sit down and\n\n475\n00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,840\njust be IT security guys, we'd be\nable to secure the site pretty well.\n\n476\n00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,300\nBut the reality is we don't have time for\nthat, right?\n\n477\n00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,740\nWe're here on the show and so\n\n478\n00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,500\nsomebody could be breaking in\nright now and we're distracted.\n\n479\n00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,230\nSo instead, we contract that out\nto a company called Security.\n\n480\n00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,875\nAnd they manage the security\nof our web site.\n\n481\n00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:09,385\nThey filter all the access and\nmake sure that we don't get broken into.\n\n482\n00:22:09,385 --> 00:22:11,915\nWe've transferred that risk over to them,\nall right?\n\n483\n00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,835\nAnd if a compromise were to occur,\nthey take care of it.\n\n484\n00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:16,705\nThey do the risk response, they handle it.\n\n485\n00:22:16,705 --> 00:22:18,015\nWe've transferred it over to them.\n\n486\n00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:19,165\nWe pay them money, right?\n\n487\n00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:20,930\nSo, just like an insurance company,\n\n488\n00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,030\nwe pay them,\nthey'll handle the event when it occurs.\n\n489\n00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:28,120\nSo that's an important part\nof dealing with a risk.\n\n490\n00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,885\n>> And then there's one more\nwe've got to deal with.\n\n491\n00:22:29,885 --> 00:22:31,640\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's my favorite one\n\n492\n00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,840\nwhich is acceptance.\n\n493\n00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,915\n>> I like this one too, it's pretty easy.\n\n494\n00:22:33,915 --> 00:22:35,580\n[LAUGH]\n>> We've reached acceptance.\n\n495\n00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,620\nRisk acceptance is where you do nothing,\nyou just say whatever yeah,\n\n496\n00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,280\nthat might happen.\n\n497\n00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,430\nI'm okay with that.\n\n498\n00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,640\n>> Don, that doesn't sound\nlike a very good choice.\n\n499\n00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,780\nIs that ever actually one we use?\n\n500\n00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,445\n>> We use it here.\n\n501\n00:22:46,445 --> 00:22:50,550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We do not have meteor impact insurance.\n\n502\n00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,510\nI can tell you that right now.\n\n503\n00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:55,110\nOur insurance policy for\nthe company, for the building,\n\n504\n00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,325\nit all reads that it\nexcludes force majeure.\n\n505\n00:22:58,325 --> 00:23:02,090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Acts of God or even acts of war,\n\n506\n00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,990\nthings like that get kind of left out.\n\n507\n00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:09,260\nBut with meteor impact it's so\nunlikely that it's going to occur.\n\n508\n00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,910\nI mean, it's really about the same odds of\na tyrannosaurus attacking the building.\n\n509\n00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,270\nIt's almost the same.\n\n510\n00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:19,820\nSo, because it's so unlikely,\nyou don't bother planning for it.\n\n511\n00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:25,030\nAny money you put forth to your meteor\ndefense plan or whatever, it's a waste.\n\n512\n00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,020\n>> We could go out and try to find\ninsurance against meteors, and pay\n\n513\n00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,140\na pretty penny for that, or start building\nsome shield around the building, right?\n\n514\n00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,950\nWe could take from this.\n\n515\n00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:35,550\n>> We could buy a shuttle and\nget Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck, and\n\n516\n00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,680\nmaybe even Steve Buscemi, and get this up.\n\n517\n00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,630\nIt'd cost a lot of money and\nwe'd never use it.\n\n518\n00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:41,658\nThey'd sit around bored all\nday telling funny stories.\n\n519\n00:23:41,658 --> 00:23:44,720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that's the kind of thing\n\n520\n00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,150\nis you have to recognize when a risk is\nnot worth planning for and there are some.\n\n521\n00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,202\nNow there are times where\ncompanies do risk acceptance when\n\n522\n00:23:52,202 --> 00:23:53,492\nit's a real risk right?\n\n523\n00:23:53,492 --> 00:23:58,380\nAnd these are the horror stories that\nwe hear of like when a car manufacturer\n\n524\n00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,173\nfinds a flaw in a seat belt.\n\n525\n00:24:00,173 --> 00:24:03,871\nAnd they determine that the recall would\ncost more than just settling the lawsuits\n\n526\n00:24:03,871 --> 00:24:06,605\nthat happen because of the flaws,\nso they accept the risk and\n\n527\n00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:09,850\nthey let it ride and they just\npay out on those lawsuits, right?\n\n528\n00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,020\nThat's really negative.\n\n529\n00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,090\nThat's not what good people do, right?\n\n530\n00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,370\nBut there are mathematics involved, right?\n\n531\n00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:21,170\nWe have to look at the financial\nimpact versus the cost of insuring.\n\n532\n00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:26,700\nAnd just a general rule of thumb but\nmost people use is 15 to 20%.\n\n533\n00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,390\nWhen you have an impact that's going\nto cost you x amount of dollars,\n\n534\n00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:37,020\nyou should spend 15 to 20% of\nthat value to prevent that loss.\n\n535\n00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:41,270\nSo if I'm worried about power outages and\nI know that a power outage is gonna impact\n\n536\n00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:46,160\nmy company, and it might cost us say\n$2,000 per hour that we're down.\n\n537\n00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,060\nThen I might look at that and say well,\n\n538\n00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,960\n15 to 20% of that is\nabout 200 bucks per hour.\n\n539\n00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,860\nSo I'm going to go ahead or\nis it 400 bucks per hour?\n\n540\n00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,120\n>> Eh, the math has got to be close.\n\n541\n00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,030\n>> No, 200 bucks,\nI was right in the first place, so\n\n542\n00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:01,490\nI might spend $200 to protect for\nthat power outage.\n\n543\n00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:05,240\nAnd $200, that will get you a UPS for your\ncritical system in your router maybe, and\n\n544\n00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,540\nthat's enough to keep you up\nduring that power outage.\n\n545\n00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,580\nIt's definitely based on money.\n\n546\n00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,210\nIf you're a company like Amazon.\n\n547\n00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,770\nI read once in one of their quarterly\nearnings reports where they were talking\n\n548\n00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,950\nabout their earnings.\n\n549\n00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,590\nAnd how they have over $2\nmillion in sales per hour.\n\n550\n00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,560\n>> Wow.\n\n551\n00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,140\n>> So if their website were to go down,\nthose are sales they wouldn't be getting.\n\n552\n00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,140\nThat's a big deal.\n\n553\n00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,810\nSo they're going to spend hundreds\nof thousands probably millions,\n\n554\n00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,900\nreally, in preventing\nthat type of failure.\n\n555\n00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,210\nSo that's all part of risk analysis and\n\n556\n00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36,980\nI know, if you ever talk to\nsomebody who does risk analysis,\n\n557\n00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,090\nthey talk about how it's boring, it's\na lot of paperwork and stuff like that.\n\n558\n00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:43,500\nBut it is really important work,\nright, cuz there's so much risk.\n\n559\n00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,750\n>> Yeah, if you don't know where to spend\nyour resources, you can end up taking\n\n560\n00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,650\nyour company's money and spending\nall of your time in your effort and\n\n561\n00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:52,163\nyour money trying to protect\nagainst things like meteors.\n\n562\n00:25:52,163 --> 00:25:56,066\nAnd if I didn't have that matrix, if I\ndidn't have a way to visualize which one\n\n563\n00:25:56,066 --> 00:25:59,793\nwas gonna have that bigger overall impact,\nI could be spending my money and\n\n564\n00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:01,560\nwasting my time.\n\n565\n00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,790\n>> Absolutely.\n\n566\n00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,310\nAll right, well Mike.\n\n567\n00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,290\nI think that's a pretty good\nrundown of risk analysis.\n\n568\n00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,840\nJust for that for the average person,\n\n569\n00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,010\nagain if you are a risk analyst,\nobviously there is a ton more to it.\n\n570\n00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:11,750\nIt's a whole art.\n\n571\n00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,380\nThere's a lot information out there.\n\n572\n00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,530\nBut I think having a basic\nunderstanding of risk and\n\n573\n00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,500\nhow we handle that is important for\nevery employee.\n\n574\n00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,780\n>> Absolutely, all right.\n\n575\n00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,460\nWell, we appreciate you guys tuning in.\n\n576\n00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,831\nWe hope you enjoyed watching as\nmuch as we did shooting this.\n\n577\n00:26:23,831 --> 00:26:25,952\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n578\n00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:33,920\n>> And I'm Don Pezet.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,010\nI'm your host, Mike Broderick.\n\n5\n00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,600\nAnd with me today is Mr. Don Pizet.\n\n6\n00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,690\nHow you doing, Don?\n\n7\n00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,060\n>> I'm doing great, Mike.\n\n8\n00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,380\nWe're coming back to you with another\nepisode of Security Fundamentals.\n\n9\n00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,163\nAnd in this video we're going to be\ntalking about business resumption and\n\n10\n00:00:26,163 --> 00:00:27,110\nrecovery.\n\n11\n00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,460\nThese are important concepts that really\nevery company should have a plan for,\n\n12\n00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,460\nshould have some documents in place.\n\n13\n00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,890\nAnd what we wanna do is cover what\nthey are, what these concepts are, and\n\n14\n00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,610\nhow they impact you,\nthe average employee in a company.\n\n15\n00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,230\nAnd really what, well why would\nwe even care about these things?\n\n16\n00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,230\n>> So with business resumption recovery,\n\n17\n00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,020\nit kinda makes me assume that\nsomething bad has happened.\n\n18\n00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,690\nSomething has gone wrong, and\nwe're trying to get back.\n\n19\n00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,750\n>> Absolutely, yeah.\n\n20\n00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,860\nAnd you know you'll hear a couple\nof terms that refer to this,\n\n21\n00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,380\nand they do get a little confusing.\n\n22\n00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,500\nYou'll hear some people talk\nabout disaster recovery,\n\n23\n00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,810\nand you hear people talk about business\nresumption, or business recovery.\n\n24\n00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,690\nNow these terms, they're pretty similar.\n\n25\n00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,980\nA lot of people use them interchangeably,\nbut\n\n26\n00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,710\nthey do actually mean different things.\n\n27\n00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,930\nRight.\nSo disaster recovery,\n\n28\n00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,300\nlike the name implies,\nthere's been a disaster.\n\n29\n00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,830\nSomething really bad has happened, and\n\n30\n00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:24,230\nthat something bad is is typically an\nentire data center winks out of existence.\n\n31\n00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,790\nOr you know a fire, hurricane, explosion.\n\n32\n00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,740\nMaybe it's the Internet connection fails,\nand\n\n33\n00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,900\nit's completely severed from the Internet.\n\n34\n00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,320\nSomething of that nature that makes that\nwhole data center just not available.\n\n35\n00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,880\nThat's a disaster, right?\n\n36\n00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,990\nVersus business resumption where\nwe're really just talking about\n\n37\n00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,620\nany little thing that\nmight interrupt service.\n\n38\n00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,680\nSo maybe a hard drive fails in a server,\nand the server stops responding.\n\n39\n00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,420\nYour other servers are still up,\nyour network is up.\n\n40\n00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,440\nIt's just this one point of impact, right?\n\n41\n00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,290\nThis one point of failure that's happened.\n\n42\n00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,670\nThat's where we need business resumption.\n\n43\n00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,550\nNow, business resumption can\nencompass disaster recovery.\n\n44\n00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,970\nThey can be grouped together, and\nthat's what a lot of companies do.\n\n45\n00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,980\nBecause what normally happens\nis business resumption\n\n46\n00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,330\nis a plan that your company has that says,\nwhen a failure happens or\n\n47\n00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,530\nwhen something happens that impacts my\ncompany doing business, here's the bare\n\n48\n00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,790\nminimum I need to do to get my\ncompany back to doing business again.\n\n49\n00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,840\nWe won't be,\nlike let's say we measured health in 100%.\n\n50\n00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,214\nSo when our company was completely\nhealthy, it was at 100% capacity.\n\n51\n00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:30,260\nAnd then I have a failure,\nand I drop to 0%.\n\n52\n00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,960\nI'm at no capacity.\n\n53\n00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,700\nWell, business resumption gets us just\nenough to be at acceptable levels.\n\n54\n00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,460\nSo maybe we're 50, 60% of what we\nused to be, but at least we're up and\n\n55\n00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,770\ndoing business again.\n\n56\n00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,930\nRight?\n\n57\n00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:42,580\nBut we're not 100%.\n\n58\n00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,630\nAnd with disaster recovery that's\ngetting us the rest of that way.\n\n59\n00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,000\nGetting us all the way back up to 100%,\n\n60\n00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,730\nso we're back to the way that we\nused to be before the disaster.\n\n61\n00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,510\nRight?\n\n62\n00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,320\nSo as an example, I used to work for\na bank, and at the bank,\n\n63\n00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,130\nif we had an outage,\nlike if our primary data center went down,\n\n64\n00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:04,340\nall the branch offices, they'd lose their\nconnectivity back to our banking system.\n\n65\n00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,110\nSo if a customer walked up to that teller\nand said, hey, I'd like to withdraw $100.\n\n66\n00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,060\nThe teller would say oh,\nI'm sorry my computer system's down.\n\n67\n00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,130\nAnd the customer would look at them and\nsay well, I need my money.\n\n68\n00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,855\nI've gotta have my money.\n\n69\n00:03:15,855 --> 00:03:18,247\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Sometimes they get irate,\n\n70\n00:03:18,247 --> 00:03:19,320\nright?\n\n71\n00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,410\nThey expect that access to their funds.\n\n72\n00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,670\nAnd there's a lot of\nother things that we did.\n\n73\n00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,910\nWe had email servers and\na website and so on.\n\n74\n00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,820\nBut if our email went down,\nif our website went down,\n\n75\n00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,800\nour customers didn't\nreally care about that.\n\n76\n00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,260\nThey wanted their money,\nthat's just what a bank is all about.\n\n77\n00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,510\nSo we had a business resumption\nplan that said look, if\n\n78\n00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,310\nyou lose connectivity to the primary data\ncenter, then here's how you handle this.\n\n79\n00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,370\nYou can give customers up to a $1,000 and\n\n80\n00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,960\njust do it on paper instead\nof on the computer.\n\n81\n00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,760\nAnd then, once the computer systems are\nback up, we can go to log those entries.\n\n82\n00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,660\nAnd if they withdrew more than a thousand\ndollars, and we'll treat as a line of\n\n83\n00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,710\ncredit you know if they drew\nmore out than they actually had.\n\n84\n00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,790\nWe'll treat it as a line of credit,\nand we'll collect that way.\n\n85\n00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,030\nBut if they had it within their account,\nthen we just remove that and\n\n86\n00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,310\nthat's the end of it.\n\n87\n00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,970\nWe were able to limp by and\n\n88\n00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,620\ndo business until we were able to\nactually recover from the failure.\n\n89\n00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,300\nThat's what business\nresumption is all about.\n\n90\n00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,640\nIt's basically a plan B.\n\n91\n00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,310\nPlan A is things are working great\nthe way they're supposed to.\n\n92\n00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,140\nPlan B is what do we do when plan\nA is not working out so well.\n\n93\n00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,528\n>> And it's really important this\nis done ahead of time, right?\n\n94\n00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:28,638\nWe don't wanna wait until the disaster or\nthe small failure has occurred, and\n\n95\n00:04:28,638 --> 00:04:30,953\ntry to figure out what\nit is we're gonna do.\n\n96\n00:04:30,953 --> 00:04:32,140\n>> Yeah.\n\n97\n00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,660\nWhen you're under pressure,\nwhen an event is occurring.\n\n98\n00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,680\nYou've got customers\nthat are lining up here.\n\n99\n00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,890\nYour public relations team is going crazy.\n\n100\n00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,690\nYour site's down.\n\n101\n00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,720\nThat's not the moment you wanna\nbe coming up with solutions.\n\n102\n00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,610\nWhen you're under that kind of pressure.\n\n103\n00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,320\nYou'd rather do it ahead of time when\nyou get your team together, and you\n\n104\n00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,530\nhave a conversation like, hey Mike, what\nare some of the different options we have\n\n105\n00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,070\nif we need to get this web server back up,\nand you know that that's a good one,\n\n106\n00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,790\nbut let's call those guys and see if\nwe get some better information on that.\n\n107\n00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,460\nYou can do that if we have time,\nwhen you can plan for it, right.\n\n108\n00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,410\nThat's why you want to\ndo this ahead of time.\n\n109\n00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,500\nAnd that's why most\ncompanies will draft up\n\n110\n00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,880\nwhat's called a Business Resumption Plan,\nor a BRP document.\n\n111\n00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,760\nNow if you're an IT employee, or\nif you're an IT Security Officer,\n\n112\n00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,070\nthen the odds are, you are involved\nin the crafting of that BRP.\n\n113\n00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,060\nIf you're not in the IT department,\nyou may still have been involved.\n\n114\n00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,800\nYour department that you're in,\nlet's say you're an insurance company, and\n\n115\n00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,620\nyou're in the underwriting department.\n\n116\n00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,230\nThen the senior employees in\nthe underwriting department\n\n117\n00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,780\nwould have participated in the BRP,\n\n118\n00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,230\ncuz they have to say here's the systems\nwe need to do our jobs, right?\n\n119\n00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,690\nI worked for\nan insurance company back in the day, and\n\n120\n00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,700\nI still to this moment don't understand\nhow underwriters do what they do.\n\n121\n00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,420\nRight?\n\n122\n00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,510\nBut I understand they need their\ncomputers, they need their data, and\n\n123\n00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,280\nsomehow they make a decision as to whether\nsomebody should be insured or not.\n\n124\n00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,220\nWell, they can tell me, well, Don,\nyou don't need to know how we do it,\n\n125\n00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,840\nbut here's the systems that we need\nto make sure we can do our job.\n\n126\n00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,290\nAnd then I know, in the BRP,\nthese are the systems they need.\n\n127\n00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,860\nRight?\nThey don't actually need email to\n\n128\n00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,430\ndo their job.\n\n129\n00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,400\nThey don't need internet\naccess to do their job.\n\n130\n00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,890\nBut they do need the statistical\nanalysis software.\n\n131\n00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,910\nThey do need to be able\nto run credit reports.\n\n132\n00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,080\nSo how can I provide that in a failure?\n\n133\n00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,670\nAnd that's what we put in our BRP.\n\n134\n00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:22,920\nHow do we provide those critical systems\nto keep those employees working?\n\n135\n00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,060\n>> So then as an end user I might help\ncreate this document by providing\n\n136\n00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,380\nthe information they need to make\nthe proper plan and decisions.\n\n137\n00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,180\nI should also be familiar with the plan,\n\n138\n00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,480\nbecause I might have a role to play in\nthe process of resuming our business.\n\n139\n00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,430\n>> Yeah.\n\n140\n00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,360\nEven if you weren't involved\nin creating the plan, even if\n\n141\n00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,700\nyou were just hired on to the company,\nand it's your first day at work, right?\n\n142\n00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,270\nYou still need to be\nfamiliar with the BRP,\n\n143\n00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,400\nbecause if a failure\nhappens what do you do?\n\n144\n00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,000\nAnd you might just have one thing to do,\nlisten to your boss.\n\n145\n00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,590\nIt might be as simple as that.\n\n146\n00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,190\nBut sometimes it's very detailed.\n\n147\n00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,300\nSo for example,\nat the bank we have where if our if our\n\n148\n00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,400\nprimary data center was destroyed,\nwhere do the employees go?\n\n149\n00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,130\nBecause we had over thousand employees\nthat were right there in the headquarters.\n\n150\n00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,020\nWhere do they go if\nthe building's destroyed?\n\n151\n00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,580\nWell, the surviving employees.\n\n152\n00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,070\nThe others don't really worry about it.\n\n153\n00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,970\nBut the ones that survive,\nthey know where to go.\n\n154\n00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,510\nIn the BRP, it said employees from these\ndepartments will go to branch number 17,\n\n155\n00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,500\nand employees in these other departments\nwill go to branch number 21.\n\n156\n00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,020\nAnd so they had branches assigned that\nthey would go to that would be set up for\n\n157\n00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,230\nthem to do their job.\n\n158\n00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,670\nIf they went to a different branch,\nit wouldn't be set up for\n\n159\n00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:31,410\nthem to do their job.\n\n160\n00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,160\nOr if they stayed home, and they didn't\nknow, then then they were in the dark.\n\n161\n00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,410\nSo every single employee had instructions\nin that BRP, not specifically.\n\n162\n00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,760\nIt didn't say, Mike Roderick,\nyou need to do this.\n\n163\n00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,180\nIt's all built around roles,\nyour have a job role.\n\n164\n00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,298\nSo if Mike is an IT Security Officer, he's\ngonna have several roles throughout that\n\n165\n00:07:51,298 --> 00:07:53,852\nBRP where it'll say\nIT Security Officer does this.\n\n166\n00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:55,608\nIT Security Officer does that.\n\n167\n00:07:55,608 --> 00:08:01,151\nOr bank tellers from, you know, they\nhandle this department, go to branch 17.\n\n168\n00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:04,690\nAnd it's based on roles, so that as you\nadd new employees or employees leave\n\n169\n00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:09,440\nthe company, that you don't have to go and\nupdate the BRP every time that happens.\n\n170\n00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,140\n>> Yeah, true, and\nthen it's a point of contact.\n\n171\n00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,960\nThere's gonna be another thing\nthat's gonna be listed in there,\n\n172\n00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,790\nwho I'm supposed to talk to in\nthe event of a business failure.\n\n173\n00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:22,780\n>> Yeah, it's it's kind of like\nthe old phone tree system, right,\n\n174\n00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,260\nwhere if something happened,\nlike a gossip tree.\n\n175\n00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,290\nWhere if something happened in a town,\none person would call two people.\n\n176\n00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,610\nAnd those two people would\neach call two people.\n\n177\n00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,150\nAnd those people would reach out and\ncall two people each.\n\n178\n00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,650\nAnd it branches out and spreads and\ncommunicates to everybody.\n\n179\n00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,610\nWell, in your BRP, you'll have\na communication plan like that because\n\n180\n00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,120\nyour normal means of\ncommunications may not work.\n\n181\n00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,320\nIf your email server is down and\n\n182\n00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,850\nthat's your primary way of notifying all\nemployees, you got to have an alternative.\n\n183\n00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,080\nAnd to have one person call every\nsingle employee, that's not realistic.\n\n184\n00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,581\nSo you set up a phone tree.\n\n185\n00:08:56,581 --> 00:09:01,241\nAnd Mike knows when a disaster\noccurs he needs to call me and Tim.\n\n186\n00:09:01,241 --> 00:09:04,341\nAnd then Tim and\nI know that when a disaster happens,\n\n187\n00:09:04,341 --> 00:09:08,440\nI need to call Vivian and Peter and\nTim needs to call Denise and Angie.\n\n188\n00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,560\nThey each know who to call.\n\n189\n00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,270\nAnd then it starts to\nbranch out from there,\n\n190\n00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,160\nand we get that notification even though\nour normal communication means is down.\n\n191\n00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,700\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n192\n00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,230\nSo it really does give us a plan of\naction, what to do so that in the time of\n\n193\n00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:26,890\ncrisis or during the event, we don't have\nto stop and think, we can just follow it.\n\n194\n00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,640\nAnd these should be practiced,\nwe should probably put test these out.\n\n195\n00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,690\n>> Oh yeah, yeah.\n\n196\n00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,600\nWhen you draft a BRP,\n\n197\n00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,780\nthere's two main things you've got to\nremember, it's kinda like having a pet.\n\n198\n00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,140\nYou can't just buy it and\nstick it in a corner and\n\n199\n00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,570\nforget about it, it's gonna die.\n\n200\n00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,670\nIn the case of a BRP it doesn't die,\nit just becomes useless.\n\n201\n00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,080\nThere's two things that kill BRPs.\n\n202\n00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,110\nOne is that they don't get tested.\n\n203\n00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,860\nYou need to test that BRP,\notherwise it's worthless.\n\n204\n00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,040\nIf a failure happens and\nyou go to this untested BRP and\n\n205\n00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,470\nsomething doesn't work, then you\njust throw that plan in the trash,\n\n206\n00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,500\nbecause now you've got to\ncome up with an all new plan.\n\n207\n00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,740\nSo it needs to be tested.\n\n208\n00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,140\nThe other thing is,\nit needs to be updated, right.\n\n209\n00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,430\nSystems change,\nmaybe you drafted this massive BRP,\n\n210\n00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:14,700\nyou spent thousands of employee hours\ndrafting an amazing BRP in 2010, right?\n\n211\n00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,630\nAnd then in 2011,\nmaybe a new version of your your\n\n212\n00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,570\nLinux distros came out or\na new version of Windows came out and\n\n213\n00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,080\nyou started migrating machines\nover to this new version.\n\n214\n00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,420\nOr just an application you use,\nan update came out and\n\n215\n00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,600\nnow the instructions you drafted in\nthe BRP no longer match the software.\n\n216\n00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,800\nWhen a disaster occurs,\n\n217\n00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,560\nthe instructions no longer work, and\nyou might as well not have a BRP, right?\n\n218\n00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,430\nSo, we need to update it.\n\n219\n00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,950\nWhenever there's a signficant change\nto our network infrastructure,\n\n220\n00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,480\nto our company, to the way we do business,\nthe BRP has to get updated.\n\n221\n00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,390\nAnd testing is how we spot areas where we\nmissed that, and we go through a test.\n\n222\n00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,250\nWe're, like, oh, shoot,\nthese don't match up.\n\n223\n00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,490\nI ran into that during a BRP\ntest where we had an SSL VPN.\n\n224\n00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,600\nAnd the software had\ndone a firmware update.\n\n225\n00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,310\nAnd the user panels,\nthe user interface, had changed.\n\n226\n00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,980\nWell, in our BRP we had\ngraphical instructions.\n\n227\n00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,130\nSo if you're an employee\nat the home office and\n\n228\n00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,340\na disaster occurs, work from home.\n\n229\n00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,800\nHere's how you connect to the SSL VPN.\n\n230\n00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,830\nAnd it had the instructions, go to this\nweb page, log in with your credentials,\n\n231\n00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,190\nyou'll build a connection.\n\n232\n00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,710\nThe pictures didn't match, and so\n\n233\n00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,870\nwe had employees that would try\nto follow these instructions.\n\n234\n00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,870\nThey would think they were\non the wrong website.\n\n235\n00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,190\nOkay, I went to this,\nit doesn't look like what's in the BRP.\n\n236\n00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,880\nI didn't feel safe doing it.\n\n237\n00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,180\nWell, thank goodness they felt that way,\nfirst off.\n\n238\n00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,010\nThat's good security practice.\n\n239\n00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,580\nBut secondly, it highlighted\nthat we failed to update the BRP\n\n240\n00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,590\nto reflect changes in our network\ninfrastructure, and so we updated that.\n\n241\n00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:43,642\nWe updated it during a test,\nnot during a critical moment and\n\n242\n00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:46,190\nthat that was a big deal, that helps.\n\n243\n00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,230\n>> So,\nit really is a living document then?\n\n244\n00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,980\nYou have to manage and maintain this\ndocument on a regular interval?\n\n245\n00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,380\n>> Yes, absolutely and\nat least every six months.\n\n246\n00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,910\nMaybe more frequently, depending on how\ncritical your outage is allowed to last.\n\n247\n00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,560\nIn the banking industry,\na lot of banks are insured by the FDIC or\n\n248\n00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,510\nat least here in the United States.\n\n249\n00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,070\nAnd the FDIC will allow\nthem 72 hours of downtime.\n\n250\n00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,780\n>> Wow.\n\n251\n00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:15,000\n>> If you have downtime greater than\n72 hours, they take you over, and\n\n252\n00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,230\nthat's not something you want.\n\n253\n00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:21,040\nSo if you can only have\nthree days of downtime and\n\n254\n00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,330\nyour BRP is bad,\nyou put your whole bank at risk.\n\n255\n00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,000\nAnd so they'll test as often as necessary\nto make sure that doesn't happen.\n\n256\n00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,850\nSo your industry might not\nbe as stringent as that.\n\n257\n00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,810\nYou might not have that critical\nrequirement and so you might test\n\n258\n00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,980\nless often, once a year or whatever,\nbut it is important to review it.\n\n259\n00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,450\n>> So regular tests and then spot tests if\nany time a major change in our network or\n\n260\n00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,160\nsomething like that.\n\n261\n00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,450\nWe go back and review it just to\nmake sure everything's working.\n\n262\n00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,380\nPersonnel changes, numbers change,\nthat phone tree for example.\n\n263\n00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,820\nThat's gotta be kept up to date.\n\n264\n00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,840\n>> Absolutely, yeah, and\nwe keep talking about this document.\n\n265\n00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,990\nLet's take a look at one.\n\n266\n00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,840\nThere's a website out there on the\ninternet called www.SearchSMBStorage.com,\n\n267\n00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,960\nand they've put out this\ngreat BRP template.\n\n268\n00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,750\nAnd what it's designed for is, if you're\nin a small business or a medium business\n\n269\n00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,040\nand you're like, man, where do I even get\nstarted on creating one of these policies?\n\n270\n00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,990\nThe policies can be big.\n\n271\n00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,030\nThey usually are,\nthey have a lot of steps in them.\n\n272\n00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:17,520\nThis policy is empty, and\nit's 28 pages long, right?\n\n273\n00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,026\nSo when you fill it out,\nlike the BRP at the bank we had,\n\n274\n00:13:21,026 --> 00:13:24,781\nI mean, it was a massive stack,\nit was hundreds of pages.\n\n275\n00:13:24,781 --> 00:13:27,711\nBecause it had step by step\ninstructions for a lot of things,\n\n276\n00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:30,060\nhow to get your company back in business.\n\n277\n00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,070\nAnd it needed to be detailed like\nthat because it's really morbid,\n\n278\n00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,890\nbut what happens if your\nentire IT staff is wiped out?\n\n279\n00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,200\nAnother IT company's gotta come in and\npick back up and get running.\n\n280\n00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,070\nSo, they need detailed instructions.\n\n281\n00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,170\nAnd so what Search SMB Storage is,\nthey said, let's create a template\n\n282\n00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,330\nthat shows people the type of stuff that\nmight be in a business continuity or\n\n283\n00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,120\nbusiness resumption plan, right?\n\n284\n00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,710\nBusiness continuity, that just means\ncontinuing to do business in spite of\n\n285\n00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:02,450\nfailure, and\nit's a document that's gonna list out\n\n286\n00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,348\nall the various things that we need\nto do to keep that business running.\n\n287\n00:14:05,348 --> 00:14:08,410\nSo let's kinda page through some of\nthe different stuff that we've got here.\n\n288\n00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,370\nThe very first thing are the emergency\nnotification contacts.\n\n289\n00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,990\nThis means if a disaster or any kind\nof business continuity issue occurs,\n\n290\n00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,510\nthese people should be\ncontacted immediately.\n\n291\n00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,830\nHere's their home address, their phone\nnumber, their cell phone number.\n\n292\n00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,700\nContact these people right now.\n\n293\n00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,290\nSo any employee in the company,\n\n294\n00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,250\nif something happens,\nthis is the response team.\n\n295\n00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:34,735\n>> Because as an employee, I might not be\nthe one that makes the decision to say,\n\n296\n00:14:34,735 --> 00:14:38,190\nthis is a disaster, or\nis this the time to kick in that plan.\n\n297\n00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,750\nRight, I don't know these things,\nsomebody else makes those decisions.\n\n298\n00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:47,240\nSo if I detect something, I see water on\nthe floor, I smell smoke, what have you.\n\n299\n00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,650\nWe've got to go through the steps, but\n\n300\n00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,100\nI might not be the one that\nactually starts the process.\n\n301\n00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,980\nI let them make that decision.\n\n302\n00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,240\n>> Yes, yep, this is the team, and\n\n303\n00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,940\nit could be one person\nif it's a small company.\n\n304\n00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,940\nBut it's normally a team of people.\n\n305\n00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,560\nAnd a certain amount of them,\npreferably all of them, but\n\n306\n00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,660\nleast a certain amount of them need to\nbe notified so that you start moving\n\n307\n00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,980\nforward on whether we actually need\nto initiate business recovery.\n\n308\n00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,544\nCuz you don't wanna failover to a whole\nother data center when it turns out that\n\n309\n00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,791\nsomebody just like, the network\ncable can unplugged on their laptop.\n\n310\n00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,272\nAnd they thought the whole\nInternet was down, true story.\n\n311\n00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:18,932\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n312\n00:15:18,932 --> 00:15:20,780\n>> So you don't want to do stuff like\n\n313\n00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,433\nthat, you got to be careful.\n\n314\n00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:24,840\nSo that's why we have something like this.\n\n315\n00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,070\nThe next page in here is\na revision control page,\n\n316\n00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,910\nand I'll tell you this\npage is way too small.\n\n317\n00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,610\nAs you edit the document, you need to\nlet people know that edits occurred.\n\n318\n00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,570\nWhat you don't want to do is\nhave a disaster occur and\n\n319\n00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,940\nsomebody starts following instructions\nfrom an old version of the BRP.\n\n320\n00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,230\nSo every time we edit the BRP, we need\nto give it a version number, right?\n\n321\n00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,172\nAnd that way people know like,\nhey I've got BRP 1.5, and\n\n322\n00:15:51,172 --> 00:15:53,580\nthen Mike says well I got BRP 1.6.\n\n323\n00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,270\nI need to take my 1.5 and\nthrow it in the trash, just immediately.\n\n324\n00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,710\nAnd say, all right, let's go with Mike's.\n\n325\n00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,772\nHe's got the good stuff, right?\n\n326\n00:15:58,772 --> 00:16:01,417\nSo you wanna make sure you've got\nversion numbering so you can track that.\n\n327\n00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:04,794\nAnd here they're tracking what changes\nwere made, who made them and so on.\n\n328\n00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:08,442\nYou kinda lay that out in your document.\n\n329\n00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:11,955\nAfter that, is kind of just\nthe introduction into the BRP.\n\n330\n00:16:11,955 --> 00:16:17,160\nNow this is, it's somewhat fluff material\nif you're an employee of the company.\n\n331\n00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,875\nBut it's not designed for you.\n\n332\n00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:22,035\nIt's designed for\nsomebody new to the company, or\n\n333\n00:16:22,035 --> 00:16:24,425\noutside contractors that\nare filling in the slack.\n\n334\n00:16:24,425 --> 00:16:27,745\nSo they need to know what this\ndocument is all about, right?\n\n335\n00:16:27,745 --> 00:16:29,225\nWhy am I reading this document?\n\n336\n00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:32,155\nWhat scope is it, and\nwhat are my objectives?\n\n337\n00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:36,285\nIf they're a contractor that's trying\nto raise this company from the dead,\n\n338\n00:16:36,285 --> 00:16:37,075\nhere's their objectives.\n\n339\n00:16:37,075 --> 00:16:38,855\nHere's what they're trying to achieve,\nright?\n\n340\n00:16:38,855 --> 00:16:42,810\nI'm looking to basically get\nthis company back up and going.\n\n341\n00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,050\nNow with any document like this,\nwe don't always have all the facts, and so\n\n342\n00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,240\nthere's certain assumptions right here.\n\n343\n00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,040\nAnd notice this first assumption,\n\n344\n00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,970\nkey people will be available\nfollowing a disaster, all right?\n\n345\n00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,385\nWhat if the key people aren't available?\n\n346\n00:16:55,385 --> 00:16:59,820\nWhat if the entire executive\nteam is wiped out somehow?\n\n347\n00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,830\nWell, this BRP's gonna have some holes\nin it, it's not gonna be complete.\n\n348\n00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,471\nThat's that warning sign we give\nto somebody reading this so\n\n349\n00:17:06,471 --> 00:17:08,179\nif they're dealing with a situation,\n\n350\n00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:10,886\nthey now know this BRP might\nnot be feature complete, right.\n\n351\n00:17:10,886 --> 00:17:14,260\nThat's the stuff that we need to\nlist here so they understand it.\n\n352\n00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,430\nAnd then probably the most important\nthing, what counts as a disaster?\n\n353\n00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,560\nDifferent people have different\ndefinitions of what counts as a disaster.\n\n354\n00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,597\nSo when do we initiate this plan?\n\n355\n00:17:24,597 --> 00:17:26,157\nWhen there's a disaster.\n\n356\n00:17:26,157 --> 00:17:29,658\nAnd here, they're saying it could be\na loss of utility service, power or water,\n\n357\n00:17:29,658 --> 00:17:33,010\nconnectivity as far as Internet access,\ncatastrophic events like weather,\n\n358\n00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,910\nnatural disaster, vandalism.\n\n359\n00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,845\nAnd vandalism, that could be like\nsomebody defaces your web site, right,\n\n360\n00:17:38,845 --> 00:17:40,125\nnot just spray paint on a wall.\n\n361\n00:17:41,385 --> 00:17:45,805\nAny kind of interruption of service, this\nis going to identify vulnerabilities and\n\n362\n00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:50,015\ngive us measures to prevent any\nkind of extended service outages.\n\n363\n00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:52,282\nNow you know when to invoke the BRP.\n\n364\n00:17:52,282 --> 00:17:54,555\nAnd it's right here in black and\nwhite, right.\n\n365\n00:17:54,555 --> 00:17:55,465\nIt's very simple.\n\n366\n00:17:55,465 --> 00:18:00,765\nThere's no indecision like, well,\ndoes this count as an incident or not?\n\n367\n00:18:00,765 --> 00:18:02,510\nWell, does it fall in these categories?\n\n368\n00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,033\nNo, all right.\nThen let's not bother the BRP\n\n369\n00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:05,420\nteam with this.\n\n370\n00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:10,040\nSo that's kind of the idea here.\n\n371\n00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,180\nThen if you have recovery teams,\n\n372\n00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,340\nyour company might have certain\npersonnel that is a response team.\n\n373\n00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,998\nWho is going to do that instant response,\nand there's different teams.\n\n374\n00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:24,350\nBecause if it's a fire in the building,\ndo you need to contact the helpdesk of IT?\n\n375\n00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,230\nNo.\n>> Probably not.\n\n376\n00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,530\n>> Yeah, they're usually not the people\nyou wanna go to for putting out fires.\n\n377\n00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:33,587\nBut you do wanna go to your building\nservices, or your superintendent,\n\n378\n00:18:33,587 --> 00:18:37,123\nor whoever it is, your infrastructure or\nfacilities people.\n\n379\n00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:38,963\nThey're the ones they can initiate that.\n\n380\n00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:41,825\nSo, we might have different teams for\ndifferent things.\n\n381\n00:18:41,825 --> 00:18:45,115\nThere's IT technical services, but then\nthere's the emergency management team or\n\n382\n00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:46,925\nthe disaster recovery team.\n\n383\n00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:50,575\nEach team has different purposes, and so\nthey then identify what those team member\n\n384\n00:18:50,575 --> 00:18:55,470\nresponsibilities are, what role it is\nthey're going to be playing, all right?\n\n385\n00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:00,770\nWhen to invoke the plan, and\nthen how we declare that disaster.\n\n386\n00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,120\nSo if a disaster's happened,\nwe need to declare it.\n\n387\n00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,860\nAnd that's where some authoritative\nfigure in the company says, all right,\n\n388\n00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,510\nladies and gentlemen, this is a disaster.\n\n389\n00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:14,900\nThe BRP needs to kick in, or the DRP,\nwhatever it is that we're labeling it as.\n\n390\n00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,650\nWe need to kick it in and\ntake the actions.\n\n391\n00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,130\nAnd that cues everyone in the company\nto grab this document and\n\n392\n00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,900\nstart following their instructions.\n\n393\n00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,210\nAnd you may not have the full book,\nthe full set of instructions.\n\n394\n00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,500\nYou might just have what's pertinent to\nyour job role, but it's time to do that.\n\n395\n00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,700\nAnd you start following\nthose instructions.\n\n396\n00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,700\nNow, the instructions typically start here\nwith notification, who to notify, right?\n\n397\n00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,130\nBut they may have a block in there for\nexternal communications.\n\n398\n00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,936\nIf you're a private company, you might\nnot need external communications, but\n\n399\n00:19:40,936 --> 00:19:43,200\nusually you do at least have\nsomething to your customers.\n\n400\n00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,560\nHow do you let your customers know that\nyou're experiencing a disaster, right?\n\n401\n00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,500\nWe had this happen, not too long ago,\n\n402\n00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,510\nit was I think about two years\nago where our web site went down.\n\n403\n00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:56,187\nAnd it was important to communicate to\nthe customers because in this day and age,\n\n404\n00:19:56,187 --> 00:19:59,558\nif your web site goes down, people\nautomatically assume you got hacked.\n\n405\n00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:00,679\nLike, oh, they got hacked!\n\n406\n00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:01,609\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And for\n\n407\n00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:05,239\nus, it went down because our service\nprovider had a data center outage because\n\n408\n00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:07,720\napparently, they don't know\nhow to work a network.\n\n409\n00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,331\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Our data center at that time.\n\n410\n00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:11,285\nWe obviously use a different provider now.\n\n411\n00:20:11,285 --> 00:20:13,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we had to communicate that out, and\n\n412\n00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,030\nso we have Twitter feeds and\nthings like that.\n\n413\n00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,346\nAnd we were able to push that message out\nsaying well, our data center provider has\n\n414\n00:20:19,346 --> 00:20:21,670\nan outage because they don't\nunderstand how BGP works.\n\n415\n00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,300\nAnd so we'll be back up shortly.\n\n416\n00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,010\nSo you want to communicate that out,\nkeep your customers in the know.\n\n417\n00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,270\nYour internal employees, your investors\nif you're publicly traded, right,\n\n418\n00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,240\nthey need to know what's going on too.\n\n419\n00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,310\nAnd that's why most companies like Google\nand Amazon, right, okay let's do Google.\n\n420\n00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,710\nIf I do a search for\ngoogle service status,\n\n421\n00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,590\nthese guys,\nthey maintain a status dashboard.\n\n422\n00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,930\nAnd so you can log in and see the status\nof all of their different services.\n\n423\n00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,042\nAnd notice back here, just a few days ago,\n\n424\n00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:52,970\nlooks like Google Calendar\nhad a service issue.\n\n425\n00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,230\nAnd I can pull it up and see, sure enough,\nthey were tracking the issue.\n\n426\n00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,400\nAnd here they were communicating, here's\nwhat's happening, we're working on it,\n\n427\n00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,500\nthere's not a good time frame.\n\n428\n00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,490\nAnd then right here at the end,\nyep, it's back up in business.\n\n429\n00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,135\nWe can see that.\n\n430\n00:21:03,135 --> 00:21:06,300\nSo as a customer if I can't get into\nGoogle Calendar, now I know why.\n\n431\n00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,060\nI know it's not just me,\nand I understand why.\n\n432\n00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,320\nThat's important to communicate.\n\n433\n00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,765\n>> And this can prevent panic from\nthe investors or other CEOs that\n\n434\n00:21:13,765 --> 00:21:17,541\nmight not be at the facility at\nthe time going, hey what's going on?\n\n435\n00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:21,121\nAnd them trying to trigger some\nkind of disaster recovery thing,\n\n436\n00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:23,710\ncuz they know, hey it's not a disaster.\n\n437\n00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,860\n>> Yeah, and\nwhat are people going to assume?\n\n438\n00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,610\n>> The worst.\n\n439\n00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,940\n>> They always assume the worst.\n\n440\n00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,260\nThey assume you got hacked,\ntheir data compromised or whatever.\n\n441\n00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,960\nAnd that can be a public\nrelations debacle even though\n\n442\n00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,650\nthe problem actually turned out to be\nsomething simple or nonconsequential.\n\n443\n00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,420\nWe need to communicate that.\n\n444\n00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,760\nAll right, after that is when we get into\nthe real nitty gritty of a plan, right.\n\n445\n00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,020\nSo you'll see this one start switching\nover to our data backup policy.\n\n446\n00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,080\nSo, oops,\nI'm just gonna start typing here.\n\n447\n00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,410\nSo, what backups we should be doing of our\nsystems, how long we retain the tapes,\n\n448\n00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:58,190\nhow we do our system image tapes,\nhow we do offsite storage of those tapes.\n\n449\n00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,260\nThese are a lot more procedural things,\nand\n\n450\n00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,350\nif you're not in the IT department,\nyou're not doing the backups, they are.\n\n451\n00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,550\nBut to them these little\nblocks are very important,\n\n452\n00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,460\nthese are preventative measures, right.\n\n453\n00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,070\nWhere do we store those backups in\nthe workplace, in the remote location?\n\n454\n00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,520\nWhere's that data going?\n\n455\n00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,980\nAnd then, what's the procedure we follow\nin the event of a natural disaster?\n\n456\n00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,260\nHere it is step by step.\n\n457\n00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,400\nA natural disaster just occurred,\nwhat do I do?\n\n458\n00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,950\nWell, step 1, notify EMT and\nDRT of pending event, all right?\n\n459\n00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,430\nStep 2, and\nthen we start going through step by step.\n\n460\n00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,036\nNo need to panic.\n\n461\n00:22:27,036 --> 00:22:27,916\nNo need to freak out.\n\n462\n00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:30,740\nNo need to formulate a plan\nwhile you're under pressure.\n\n463\n00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,350\nHere it is, step by step,\n\n464\n00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,950\nwhat I need to go through to get\nmy company back in business.\n\n465\n00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,240\n>> And as an end user,\nthat's got to be a great stress relief,\n\n466\n00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,805\nhaving something like that in front of me,\nbecause I don't know what I'm supposed to.\n\n467\n00:22:42,805 --> 00:22:44,030\nOh, wait, here's my steps.\n\n468\n00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,920\nI know exactly what I'm supposed to do.\n\n469\n00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,110\nI don't have to think about it.\n\n470\n00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,000\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n471\n00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,340\nI've got it right here in black and white.\n\n472\n00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,727\n>> Yep, I like this one here,\nin the event of a fire.\n\n473\n00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:54,175\nRight, what I do is there's a fire?\n\n474\n00:22:54,175 --> 00:22:57,195\nAnd this applies to every\nemployee in the entire company.\n\n475\n00:22:57,195 --> 00:22:59,076\nRight, this is why\nthe BRP is important for\n\n476\n00:22:59,076 --> 00:23:02,119\nus to understand regardless of our\nrank and position in the company.\n\n477\n00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,670\nIn the event of a fire,\nstep 1, dial 9-1-1.\n\n478\n00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,550\nDon't call the help desk.\n\n479\n00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,180\nDon't go looking for your manager.\n\n480\n00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,710\nDon't duck under your desk or\nduck and roll.\n\n481\n00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,344\n>> Stop, drop, and roll.\n\n482\n00:23:12,344 --> 00:23:14,340\n>> [LAUGH] Don't do any of that.\n\n483\n00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,820\nCall 9-1-1, because we're not firemen.\n\n484\n00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,670\nWell, unless you work at the firehouse,\nI suppose.\n\n485\n00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,042\nSo, but dial 9-1-1, right.\n\n486\n00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:25,130\nStep 2, immediately notify all\npersonnel in the facility.\n\n487\n00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,445\nAgain, don't mess with management.\n\n488\n00:23:26,445 --> 00:23:28,525\nJust let people know there's a fire.\n\n489\n00:23:28,525 --> 00:23:29,655\nGet the heck out!\n\n490\n00:23:29,655 --> 00:23:30,575\n>> Get out of the building.\n\n491\n00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,905\n[LAUGH]\n>> Like pork chop sandwiches.\n\n492\n00:23:32,905 --> 00:23:34,585\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n493\n00:23:34,585 --> 00:23:36,265\n>> All right, so again, get out.\n\n494\n00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:39,880\nAnd then after that,\nalert emergency personnel.\n\n495\n00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,700\nNow, we start following to\nour regular practices, right.\n\n496\n00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,120\nLet those teams know.\n\n497\n00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,840\nBecause those teams,\nthey might not be at your facility.\n\n498\n00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,230\nYou might be at a branch office\nthat's burning down to the ground.\n\n499\n00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,920\nAnd now, after you get your employees\nsafe, then call the headquarters,\n\n500\n00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,330\nlet them know, and\nthat team starts rolling.\n\n501\n00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,245\nCuz they're gonna need to\ncall the insurance company,\n\n502\n00:23:58,245 --> 00:23:59,313\nget some adjusters out there.\n\n503\n00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,819\nThey're gonna need to provide alternate\nwork spaces for the employees.\n\n504\n00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:03,795\nThey're gonna need to do things, but\n\n505\n00:24:03,795 --> 00:24:07,270\nthe immediate danger is just getting\npeople out of that building.\n\n506\n00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,316\nSo that's kind of what you see.\n\n507\n00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:09,888\nAnd then right down here,\n\n508\n00:24:09,888 --> 00:24:14,070\nall personnel will meet at their\nassigned outside location.\n\n509\n00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:18,180\nUnder no circumstances may any personnel\nleave without the consent of supervision.\n\n510\n00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,530\nThat means we need to\nverify that people got out.\n\n511\n00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,670\nKeep a roll call so we can tell if\nanybody's still in the building, right?\n\n512\n00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,260\nHow do we know?\n\n513\n00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,160\n>> So if I slip off to Burger King to\ngo grab a sandwich while everybody\n\n514\n00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,000\nelse is piling out there,\nyou might think I'm still in the building.\n\n515\n00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,440\nAnd send people in there, and\nrisk their lives trying to rescue me.\n\n516\n00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,181\nAnd I'm over here having french fries.\n\n517\n00:24:36,181 --> 00:24:37,381\n>> Yep, yep.\n\n518\n00:24:37,381 --> 00:24:38,201\nOr onion rings, right?\n\n519\n00:24:38,201 --> 00:24:38,942\nWe got options.\n>> Or onion rings.\n\n520\n00:24:38,942 --> 00:24:40,440\n>> [LAUGH] So yeah.\n\n521\n00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,540\nBut, yeah, it is a real risk.\n\n522\n00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:46,730\nWe've got other things here like, their\nBRP is, it's an example, it's a template,\n\n523\n00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:47,500\nsomething you can use.\n\n524\n00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,000\nBut there's actually a good chunk\nof stuff here that's truly usable.\n\n525\n00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,500\nLike, their next one here is,\nif it's a network outage.\n\n526\n00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,260\nNow, a network outage,\nthat's if our ISP were to fail.\n\n527\n00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,940\nThat's a lot different than a fire.\n\n528\n00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,408\nYour life is not likely in danger if\nyour Internet connection goes down.\n\n529\n00:25:01,408 --> 00:25:04,380\nAlthough you kind of wonder when\nsome people lose their Facebook.\n\n530\n00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,750\nBut here's the steps.\n\n531\n00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,770\nWhat do you do?\n\n532\n00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,230\nNotify senior management.\n\n533\n00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,500\nNotify the other team as the EMT.\n\n534\n00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:15,310\nIf the outage would be greater than one\nhour, route calls via alternate services.\n\n535\n00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,790\nSo if my outage is gonna be\ngreater than an hour, let's go and\n\n536\n00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,250\nfail over towards our\ndisaster recovery site.\n\n537\n00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,980\nBut if it's less than an hour,\nlet's just let it be down and fix it.\n\n538\n00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,330\nAnd why would somebody do that?\n\n539\n00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:28,560\nWhy would somebody not fail\nover to DR side if they could?\n\n540\n00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,710\nCuz it's a lot of work to fail back again,\nright?\n\n541\n00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,760\nMoving over to a DR side is one thing, but\n\n542\n00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,800\nthen moving from the DR\nsite back to production?\n\n543\n00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,030\nThat's a whole other thing.\n\n544\n00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,780\nSo if you can avoid that process,\nyou should, right?\n\n545\n00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,250\nAnd here they're saying we've\ngot one hour that's acceptable.\n\n546\n00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,790\nThat might not be the same for you.\n\n547\n00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:49,420\nOne hour, if you work for\nthe 911 dispatch,\n\n548\n00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,620\nyou can't have an hour of downtime on 911,\nthat's crazy.\n\n549\n00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,140\nYou can't have seconds, so\nyou fail over immediately, right?\n\n550\n00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,223\nYou don't wait an hour.\n\n551\n00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:58,730\nBut for this company, it's okay.\n\n552\n00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,750\nSo each company has different needs.\n\n553\n00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,370\nIn the event of flood or water damage.\n\n554\n00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,850\nAnd what else do we have here?\n\n555\n00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,120\nOkay, so after that,\nwe start getting into our other things,\n\n556\n00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,570\nlike our alert verification and\ndeclaration phase, right?\n\n557\n00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,140\nHere's our plan.\n\n558\n00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,150\nAnd we'd start to put in our\nchecklists for what to do.\n\n559\n00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:16,530\n>> We had a really good\nquestion in the chat room and\n\n560\n00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,500\nI think we kinda just answered that.\n\n561\n00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,050\nRick was asking should recovery\nfrom a cyber attack be\n\n562\n00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,130\ndifferent from a physical disaster?\n\n563\n00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,550\nAnd there are gonna be some differences.\n\n564\n00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,730\nAnd as we see in this plan, they\nthought about each one of those, right?\n\n565\n00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,280\nThey planned out what a flood is,\nwhat a fire does.\n\n566\n00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,830\nThey're both disasters, but\nwe're gonna react differently.\n\n567\n00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,510\nSo I think in the end that's\nwhat the plan is gonna define.\n\n568\n00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,610\n>> Yeah,\nbecause let's just use an example, right?\n\n569\n00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:40,010\nSo if my headquarters burns down and\n\n570\n00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:44,334\nI've got a disaster recovery site that's a\nclone of my production data center, I can\n\n571\n00:26:44,334 --> 00:26:48,540\nfail over to that clone data center and\nbe up and running in a moment's notice.\n\n572\n00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,680\nBut if somebody hacks into\nmy production network and\n\n573\n00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,010\ngains access to my database and\nshuts down my websites.\n\n574\n00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:58,430\nAnd I fail over to my disaster recovery\nsite that's a clone of my production,\n\n575\n00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,650\nwhat's gonna happen?\n\n576\n00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,420\nIt's just as vulnerable as production was.\n\n577\n00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,600\nWhatever they used to get in,\nthey can use over there too.\n\n578\n00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,510\nSo, that disaster recovery site is\nno longer a viable alternative.\n\n579\n00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,870\nI need to find out how they got in and\n\n580\n00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:15,420\nclose that means of attack off and\nthen maybe I fail over the DR, whatever.\n\n581\n00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,980\nBut just failing over to DR there\nis not gonna make a big difference.\n\n582\n00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,516\nSo it is different responses for each.\n\n583\n00:27:19,516 --> 00:27:21,790\nThey each have separate\nsections inside of that plan.\n\n584\n00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:27,600\nAll right, and the rest of this document\nis really made up of those plans and\n\n585\n00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,270\nchecklists.\n\n586\n00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:31,020\nAnd so you'll see things like this here,\ntasks to be completed.\n\n587\n00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,190\nIt's important do it\nin a checklist format.\n\n588\n00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:38,170\nBecause when the disaster occurs,\nsomebody's gonna take this checklist.\n\n589\n00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,200\nAnd they'll go line by line,\nmarking them off.\n\n590\n00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,530\nTick, tick, tick, right?\n\n591\n00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,720\nMaking sure it's complete.\n\n592\n00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,500\nThat you get to all\nthose different values.\n\n593\n00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,200\nThat all the different things are taken\ncare of to ensure that you're\n\n594\n00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,940\nproperly restored and back in business.\n\n595\n00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,120\nIf you miss a step,\nsomething might not work when you try and\n\n596\n00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,420\nbring the system back up and\nthe system doesn't come up.\n\n597\n00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,170\nAnd now you haven't resumed business.\n\n598\n00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,410\nYou're dealing with trying to\nfigure out which step you missed.\n\n599\n00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,658\nSo, it's important have\nchecklists like these.\n\n600\n00:28:00,658 --> 00:28:04,055\nSo, that's a great example.\n\n601\n00:28:04,055 --> 00:28:06,825\nIf you're ever board,\ncheck out searchesmbstorage.com.\n\n602\n00:28:06,825 --> 00:28:09,415\nThey've got this template,\nyou can Google for it easily.\n\n603\n00:28:09,415 --> 00:28:12,385\nIt's like first response when you\nsearch for disaster recovery template.\n\n604\n00:28:12,385 --> 00:28:14,725\nBut it's a great one, and\nit really helps you so\n\n605\n00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:16,512\nyou're not having to start from scratch.\n\n606\n00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,262\nBut you can.\n\n607\n00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:20,532\nPlenty of people will start from\nscratch crafting their own policy.\n\n608\n00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,742\nThe more thorough you are the better.\n\n609\n00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:26,202\nBut the more thorough you are, the harder\nit is to maintain and keep up to date.\n\n610\n00:28:26,202 --> 00:28:28,762\nJust remember you do need to\nmaintain it and keep it up to date.\n\n611\n00:28:28,762 --> 00:28:30,012\nThings change.\n\n612\n00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:33,430\nAnd any time a change happens in your\nnetwork the disaster recovery, or BRP,\n\n613\n00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:37,900\nthe Business Resumption Plan,\nthose need to be updated to reflect that.\n\n614\n00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,720\n>> That's a lot of great information Don.\n\n615\n00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,540\nAnything else we wanna throw in\nour Business Recovery Plans?\n\n616\n00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,780\n>> I think that's about it.\n\n617\n00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,380\nI just, I really did wanna\nstress how every single employee\n\n618\n00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,910\nis involved in business resumption.\n\n619\n00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,550\nYou've got at least some role in there\neven if it's just following instructions.\n\n620\n00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,070\nSo be aware of your plan.\n\n621\n00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:58,020\nIf you've never heard of this before,\nask your manager about it and\n\n622\n00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,190\nsee what's going on.\n\n623\n00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,670\nAnd your manager might say,\noh, I've got it.\n\n624\n00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:03,270\nI'll take care of it\nwhen a disaster occurs.\n\n625\n00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,840\nBut what if they're not available?\n\n626\n00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,340\nRight?\n\n627\n00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,900\nSo, you need to have some kind of plan for\nthat.\n\n628\n00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:08,750\nAnd it's all in there.\n\n629\n00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,490\nEverybody plays a part.\n\n630\n00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,340\n>> Okay, good.\n\n631\n00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,890\nAll right, well I hoped you enjoyed\nthe episode as much as we have\n\n632\n00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:14,700\nshooting the episode.\n\n633\n00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,430\nI wanna thank you guys for watching.\n\n634\n00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,060\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike

host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Don Pezet.\n\n4\n00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,550\nHow you doing, Don?\n\n5\n00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,180\n>> I am doing great, Mike.\n\n6\n00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,930\nIn this episode, we're going to\nbe tackling, well, paperwork.\n\n7\n00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,720\nThere's not really a great way\nto put it other than paperwork.\n\n8\n00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,880\nWe're gonna take a look at some of\nthe written policies that surround the IT\n\n9\n00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,540\nworld.\n\n10\n00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,000\nAnd While you an employee may not be\nresponsible for writing these, or\n\n11\n00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,030\neven reading, in some cases.\n\n12\n00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,140\nWe do need to be familiar with the\ndifferent types of documents that are out\n\n13\n00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,050\nthere, and what their uses are.\n\n14\n00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,486\nBecause some of them\nare actually pretty important.\n\n15\n00:00:43,486 --> 00:00:44,545\n>> There's a lot of them, and\n\n16\n00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:48,515\nmost likely we had to sign a few of them,\nwhen we got hired by this company.\n\n17\n00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,205\nAnd say we read them, right?\n\n18\n00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:55,015\n>> And then Mike says this company\nlike well here absolutely, but\n\n19\n00:00:55,015 --> 00:00:57,460\nany company is like this these days.\n\n20\n00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,060\nThat there's certain\nlegal liabilities that\n\n21\n00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,890\nare incurred just through using your\ncomputer from being in a company.\n\n22\n00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,150\nAnd so there's documents they put out\nthat define what your rights are,\n\n23\n00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,480\nwhat the company's rights are, and so on.\n\n24\n00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,990\nAnd what your expected behavior is to be.\n\n25\n00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,600\nNow most of the time we don't\ncare about these, right?\n\n26\n00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,330\nEvery time I install software,\n\n27\n00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,852\nthere's a screen that pops up\nwith a huge legal document.\n\n28\n00:01:20,852 --> 00:01:23,802\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm like Next, just Agree, whatever,\n\n29\n00:01:23,802 --> 00:01:24,580\nmove past it.\n\n30\n00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,560\nBut that document serves a purpose.\n\n31\n00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,900\nAnd so when you don't understand\nwhat that purpose is, and whether or\n\n32\n00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,390\nnot we choose to read\nit's a different story.\n\n33\n00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,300\nBut it does exist for a reason,\nit is an important reason.\n\n34\n00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,520\nAnd we're gonna continue to see more and\nmore of these as times goes on.\n\n35\n00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,071\nDue to the, you know, the heavy litigation\nthat our culture has developed these days.\n\n36\n00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:45,439\n>> Because really what it comes out in\na lot of these are kind of CYA type\n\n37\n00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,352\nthings, right?\n\n38\n00:01:46,352 --> 00:01:52,300\n>> Yeah, and you know,\nthat's code for cover your butt.\n\n39\n00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,940\nWe got to protect ourselves,\nthe company has to protect themselves.\n\n40\n00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,170\nIt's all part of that.\n\n41\n00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,770\nSo all of these different legal\ndocuments that we see fall under this\n\n42\n00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,510\none umbrella term of a security policy.\n\n43\n00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,560\nThat your companies\nhave security policies,\n\n44\n00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,620\nyour IT Department has\nIT security policies.\n\n45\n00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,010\nAnd what they are is simply a definition.\n\n46\n00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,320\nThat says if employees\nbehave in this manner, and\n\n47\n00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,550\nif the company behaves in this manner.\n\n48\n00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,250\nThen we'll all be nice, safe, secure, and\n\n49\n00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,070\neverybody'll be able to work in peace and\nharmony.\n\n50\n00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,330\nAnd if anybody deviates from the\nprescribed behavior of those documents,\n\n51\n00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,280\nthen we're gonna have a problem.\n\n52\n00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,290\nAnd that problem might\n\n53\n00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,120\nbe that an employee's behavior\nleads to their termination.\n\n54\n00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,060\nThey get fired, or it might be that\none employee offends another employee,\n\n55\n00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,490\nand now there's a lawsuit.\n\n56\n00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,130\nIt could be that data gets lost and\nnow you gotta rebuild that.\n\n57\n00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,630\nIt could be that customer data\ngets exposed to the Internet,\n\n58\n00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,950\nwhen it shouldn't have been.\n\n59\n00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,930\nThat's what these policies all define.\n\n60\n00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,470\nIs the normal behavior that\nwould lead to those events not\n\n61\n00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,840\nhappening in the first place.\n\n62\n00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,500\nSo, the really, really useful.\n\n63\n00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,580\n>> A lot of times we tend to think\nof them as oh, this is the company\n\n64\n00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,160\ntrying to protect themselves against\nlitigation, or whatever the case may be.\n\n65\n00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,700\nBut.\n\n66\n00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,800\nA lot of times it's to protect us as well,\nthe employees.\n\n67\n00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,280\nFrom some type of litigation\nthat might have occurred.\n\n68\n00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,540\nSo they are good.\n\n69\n00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,590\nThey have a good purpose.\n\n70\n00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,360\n>> Yeah.\n\n71\n00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,140\nNow this security policies, they're\nwhat are called top level documents.\n\n72\n00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,720\nAnd top level document means many\npeople might have written it.\n\n73\n00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,060\nBut at the end of the day,\n\n74\n00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,750\nit's the head of your company\nthat signs off on them, right?\n\n75\n00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,410\nYour CEO, your President,\n\n76\n00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,330\nwhoever that person is that's\nrunning your organization.\n\n77\n00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,530\nThey're the authority behind the document.\n\n78\n00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,540\nAnd they're basically dictating,\nthis is the behavior I want to see.\n\n79\n00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,460\nIf you deviate from that behavior,\nyou're outside the company norms and\n\n80\n00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,250\nthat may lead to termination or\nother penalties, whatever.\n\n81\n00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,340\nBut this is what I expect, right?\n\n82\n00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,640\nSo at the top a little document,\ndown inside of it,\n\n83\n00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,490\nwe're going to be expressing\nall sorts of things.\n\n84\n00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,410\nWhat the purpose of that document is,\nwhat it does, what we expect people to do.\n\n85\n00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,200\nAll sorts of other little pieces of\nthat puzzle that kind of fall together\n\n86\n00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,160\ninto making one of these.\n\n87\n00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,460\n>> You know, we're going to, what their\npurpose is and who it applies to.\n\n88\n00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:04,070\nYeah, and that's the real tough because\nyou might have a 50 page document,\n\n89\n00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:07,430\nbut only a small portion of it\napplies to a particular employee.\n\n90\n00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,420\nAnd it's written in legalese, so\nif you're an attorney you can read it.\n\n91\n00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,160\nBut if you're not or\nmaybe if you know a little Latin.\n\n92\n00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,880\nBut if you don't,\n\n93\n00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,950\nif you're your average run of\nthe mill employee, you can't read it.\n\n94\n00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,358\nIt doesn't make sense, and so\n\n95\n00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,751\nthose policies have to be\nwritten more than one way.\n\n96\n00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:22,361\nSo there'll be a summary like\na generalization at the beginning.\n\n97\n00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:28,573\nAnd then the real fine print that kind\nof comes afterwards that really details\n\n98\n00:04:28,573 --> 00:04:34,490\nthings to a level that is,\nthey call it being unquestionable, right?\n\n99\n00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,370\nThat you can't Interpret\nmore than one way.\n\n100\n00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,490\nLike, it's very well defined.\n\n101\n00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,840\nThis is what it means.\n\n102\n00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,900\nAnd that's why it requires so much text.\n\n103\n00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,160\n>> And this top level document,\nthis security policy,\n\n104\n00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,000\nreally does start to tie\neverything together.\n\n105\n00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,610\nBecause you could have it where individual\ndepartments have their own sets of\n\n106\n00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,910\nrules and regulations,\nor something like that.\n\n107\n00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:58,550\nAnd you might get fooled into thinking\nthat if I follow my department's\n\n108\n00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,260\npolicies here, then I'm doing\nwhat's right for the company.\n\n109\n00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,470\nBut it doesn't, it could be something that\nworks out great for your department but\n\n110\n00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,050\nnot for the rest.\n\n111\n00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,280\nSo this kinda ties it all together.\n\n112\n00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,760\nIt makes sure that all those individual\npolicies that we're going to talk about.\n\n113\n00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,130\nreally have the company in mind when\nit comes to the good of the company.\n\n114\n00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,030\n>> Yeah, all right, I find the best\nway to really learn about these things\n\n115\n00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,810\nis to see some actual documents, right?\n\n116\n00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,830\nSo let's start, what I've got pulled\nup on my screen here is the information\n\n117\n00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,510\nsecurity policy for\nthe University of Oxford.\n\n118\n00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,060\nThey post it right online.\n\n119\n00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,460\nNow, You might say to yourself,\nwhy would they publish that policy online?\n\n120\n00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,590\nWell they expect not just their staff,\nbut their employees.\n\n121\n00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,690\nThere's, well, employees and\nstaff are the same.\n\n122\n00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,100\nTheir students, right?\n\n123\n00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,900\nPeople that are on campus.\n\n124\n00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,820\nEven visitors to the campus,\nto follow basic security policies.\n\n125\n00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,790\nAnd so, when we look at this this,\nthis is a obligation for\n\n126\n00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,890\nanyone who goes over to Oxford and\nuses their computer systems.\n\n127\n00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,090\nAnd it starts out fairly high level.\n\n128\n00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:57,900\nIt introduces when this was drafted,\nwho approved it.\n\n129\n00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,390\nWho was involved in that\ncreation of this document and\n\n130\n00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,000\nthen it breaks it down from there.\n\n131\n00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,350\nThere's that purpose,\nlike I mentioned earlier.\n\n132\n00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,760\nMy aims and commitments, responsibilities,\nand then it lays it all out.\n\n133\n00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,410\nSo what does this document do?\n\n134\n00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,730\nIt says it gives us a framework for\n\n135\n00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:16,140\nthe management of information\nsecurity through the University.\n\n136\n00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,320\nAll those with access to the university\ninformation systems including staff,\n\n137\n00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,950\nstudent, visitors, and\ncontractors, this applies to them.\n\n138\n00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,230\nStaff, students, visitors, right,\nthat's why this is public.\n\n139\n00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,500\nThat's why it's on the website,\nbecause this really applies to everybody.\n\n140\n00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,420\nAnd then after that it lays out\na prescribed level of of commitments,\n\n141\n00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,650\nresponsibilities, that anybody\nusing a computer system has.\n\n142\n00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,970\nAnd what you need to do.\n\n143\n00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,740\nIdentifies the risks, and\nwhat they're doing to protect from that.\n\n144\n00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,730\nSo they're really laying\nthis out in plain text.\n\n145\n00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,330\nYou can't confuse it, right?\n\n146\n00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,500\nThis is it.\n\n147\n00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,380\nI need to be perform these actions.\n\n148\n00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,010\nAnd you'll see that right here\nunder the responsibilities.\n\n149\n00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,800\nIf you're on the council,\nyou have ultimate responsibility for\n\n150\n00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,930\ninformation security.\n\n151\n00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,900\nIn other words, if things go wrong,\nit's your fault.\n\n152\n00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,830\nThat's the person to blame.\n\n153\n00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,390\nThat's the person who has ultimate\nresponsibility at the end of the day.\n\n154\n00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,110\nBut if you're not on the council,\nwhere do you fall in the mix?\n\n155\n00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,170\nWell, they lay it out.\n\n156\n00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:14,290\nIf you're the head of a department,\nwell you need to perform certain actions.\n\n157\n00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,110\nSpecific roles and\n\n158\n00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,790\nresponsibilities within the department\nshould be clearly identified.\n\n159\n00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,950\nYou might have a security policy just for\nyour department.\n\n160\n00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,340\nBecause different departments\nmight have different needs.\n\n161\n00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:30,700\nIf you're in the, say you're in\nthe liberal arts, and maybe you're\n\n162\n00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:36,990\nin the department where\nyou study paintings.\n\n163\n00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,900\nWell, paintings that\nwere done 200 years ago,\n\n164\n00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,740\nit's not like that's copyright material or\nanything.\n\n165\n00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,970\nYou're not dealing with sensitive data.\n\n166\n00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,840\nIt's public works at this point.\n\n167\n00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,405\nSo you might not have as\ngreat information security,\n\n168\n00:07:47,405 --> 00:07:50,260\nas the college that's responsible for\nmedical training.\n\n169\n00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,963\nWhere you're learning with medical\nrecords of actual patient data,\n\n170\n00:07:52,963 --> 00:07:54,070\nthat needs to be protected.\n\n171\n00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,670\nSo different departments might\nhave their own security policy.\n\n172\n00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,300\nAnd then we just have users and\nexternal parties, right?\n\n173\n00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,406\nUsers will be made aware of their\nown individual responsibilities for\n\n174\n00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:08,080\ncomplying with the university department\npolicies on information security.\n\n175\n00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,194\nNow it's not actually telling me\nwhat the users need to do here,\n\n176\n00:08:11,194 --> 00:08:13,455\nit's just saying that\nthey will be notified.\n\n177\n00:08:13,455 --> 00:08:15,190\nHow will they be notified?\n\n178\n00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,070\nWell, one security policy\nisn't normally enough.\n\n179\n00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,610\nThere's normally supporting documents\nthat go along with it and that's some of\n\n180\n00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,150\nthe things that we're going to see in\nthe rest of the show are all those other\n\n181\n00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:28,540\ndocuments that go along with it and an end\nuser doesn't normally see this big policy\n\n182\n00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,325\nbecause the parts that pertain to them\nare split off into separate documents.\n\n183\n00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:35,965\n>> A lot of times then and towards the end\nof these documents there will be links or\n\n184\n00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:38,465\nreferences to all those other policies.\n\n185\n00:08:38,465 --> 00:08:42,757\nSo that if I need to look at the specific\none for my department, or if I wanna look\n\n186\n00:08:42,757 --> 00:08:46,935\nat document security or something like\nthat, I can find that information.\n\n187\n00:08:46,935 --> 00:08:50,689\nSo this, again, is that top level\ndocument that ties it all together.\n\n188\n00:08:50,689 --> 00:08:52,921\n>> Now, you'll see,\nas you continue reading through it,\n\n189\n00:08:52,921 --> 00:08:55,180\nlike in this document here\nwe get to personal data.\n\n190\n00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,720\nWhat counts as personal data?\n\n191\n00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,480\nHow do we handle it?\n\n192\n00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,780\nHere's personal data must be\nhandled in a certain way.\n\n193\n00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,120\nHere's the requirements.\n\n194\n00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,507\nAnd then it's got these little footnote\nlinks that take you to their data\n\n195\n00:09:04,507 --> 00:09:08,074\nprotection plan that was defined and\nthose are what Mike was talking about.\n\n196\n00:09:08,074 --> 00:09:09,755\nHere, the little footnotes are inline but\n\n197\n00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:12,148\nthey might be all the way at\nthe bottom of the document, too.\n\n198\n00:09:12,148 --> 00:09:16,933\nIf I continue scrolling through you'll\nsee cryptographic controls, backups,\n\n199\n00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:21,715\nhard copies, enforcement, all of this\nstuff laid out, here's our contacts for\n\n200\n00:09:21,715 --> 00:09:23,300\nfurther information.\n\n201\n00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,710\nOther relevant university policies so\n\n202\n00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:30,380\nwe've got computer disposal,\ndata protection, more data protection.\n\n203\n00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,760\nWe've got freedom of information and\nfor document submittals there.\n\n204\n00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,440\nHandling of illegal material,\nprivacy policies,\n\n205\n00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,250\nrecords management policies,\nthese are all supplemental policies.\n\n206\n00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,740\nAnd these are the ones that normally\nreally get into the nitty gritty details.\n\n207\n00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,240\nSo if I go to computer disposal,\nwe can follow into that one.\n\n208\n00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,060\nAnd here it's gonna give me,\nhow do I dispose of it, right?\n\n209\n00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,610\nHere's how I can make arrangements for\n\n210\n00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,670\nspecific types of hazardous waste\ndisposal and how I delete that data.\n\n211\n00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,840\nWhat's considered acceptable.\n\n212\n00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,700\nHere's the help desk I can reach out to.\n\n213\n00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,670\nIt's all laid out right\nhere In that policy.\n\n214\n00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,180\nThis is a security policy and\nthey tend to be the largest\n\n215\n00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,140\nof the documents that we're\ngoing to talk about today.\n\n216\n00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,650\n>> All right, so we've got our security\npolicy that a gives us an overarching\n\n217\n00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,520\ndocument and then what's next?\n\n218\n00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,325\nWe got like one I always see\nis that acceptable use policy.\n\n219\n00:10:20,325 --> 00:10:24,455\n>> Yeah, the acceptable use policy is\nthe one that to an end user is probably\n\n220\n00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:26,159\nthe most important, right?\n\n221\n00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,746\nIf I were to go to to my work and\nsit down and\n\n222\n00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:31,730\nthey give me a computer\nwith Internet access.\n\n223\n00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800\nI can use that computer for work.\n\n224\n00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,160\nWell, what am I allowed to do,\nand what am I not allowed to do?\n\n225\n00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,611\nIf it's my lunch break and\nI wanna go on eBay and buy something,\n\n226\n00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:45,019\nam I allowed to do that?\n\n227\n00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,400\nIt's my lunch break, I'm not on the clock.\n\n228\n00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,364\nIf I wanna browse eBay, am I allowed\nto use a company computer to do that?\n\n229\n00:10:50,364 --> 00:10:51,686\nI don't know, can I?\n\n230\n00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:53,840\n>> I don't know.\n>> Maybe, maybe not, right?\n\n231\n00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,020\nThe acceptable use policy will say that,\n\n232\n00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,480\nit'll say during your lunch break you're\nallowed to go to websites or whatever.\n\n233\n00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,910\nIt defines what is acceptable use\nof the equipment for that company.\n\n234\n00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,910\nSo the AUP, or acceptable use policy,\nis pretty important for us as end users.\n\n235\n00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,350\nBecause it's also gonna define\nwhen we get in trouble.\n\n236\n00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,530\nWhat if you're doing something\nyou're not allowed to do?\n\n237\n00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,920\nWhat if I'm browsing pornography\non the work computer,\n\n238\n00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,040\nwhich you'd think people would not do.\n\n239\n00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,410\nBut I tell you, as somebody who's run the\nWeb filters for companies of pretty large\n\n240\n00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,320\nsizes, I can tell you,\npeople browse pornography from work.\n\n241\n00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,830\nIt blows your mind.\n\n242\n00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,900\nAnd if it's in the acceptable use policy,\nit's right there.\n\n243\n00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,260\nYou tell people.\n\n244\n00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,140\nAnd, you know, the story I always have,\nis I work for an insurance company.\n\n245\n00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,480\nWe had a gentleman in the accounting\ndepartment who was browsing pornography.\n\n246\n00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,700\nAnd we had a Web filter.\n\n247\n00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,120\nWe kept logs of of where people went, but\nwe didn't really monitor the traffic.\n\n248\n00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,940\nAnd that person's manager came to us\nin the IT department one day and said,\n\n249\n00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,570\nlook I've got this employee.\n\n250\n00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,130\nThey're really not working very hard,\nthey're not,\n\n251\n00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,020\nI think they're just browsing\nthe Internet all day.\n\n252\n00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,350\nDo you have their Weblogs?\n\n253\n00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,260\nAnd as their manager they were allowed to\nrequest that, so we provided the logs.\n\n254\n00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,245\nAnd sure enough you can just\nsee just porn, porn, porn.\n\n255\n00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:05,040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well,\n\n256\n00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,810\nin the acceptable use policy it specified\nthat you could be terminated for that.\n\n257\n00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,580\nSo it was in the company's rights to just\n\n258\n00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,220\nterminate that employee and\nthat be the end of it.\n\n259\n00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,620\nBut they gave him a second chance and\nthey said look, you can't do this,\n\n260\n00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,750\nit's in the acceptable use policy.\n\n261\n00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,680\nYou signed this when you were\nhired that said you're not\n\n262\n00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,640\ngonna use the computer this way,\nand you did it.\n\n263\n00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:29,250\nSo stop, don't do it, and we had\nthe Weblogs, they were all right there.\n\n264\n00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:33,340\nWell, that employee thought\nthat we faked the logs\n\n265\n00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,994\nthat we couldn't actually watch what he\nwas doing, and he continued to do it.\n\n266\n00:12:36,994 --> 00:12:37,829\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n267\n00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:40,873\nI was like well, we don't fabricate\nthe stuff, it's right here, and\n\n268\n00:12:40,873 --> 00:12:43,500\nso that they ultimately got terminated.\n\n269\n00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,260\nIt was well-defined right there.\n\n270\n00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,920\nNow, it helps you, the employee,\ncuz you know what you're allowed to do and\n\n271\n00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,290\nwhat you're not allowed to do.\n\n272\n00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,830\nIt helps the company because now\nthey can terminate an employee for\n\n273\n00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,520\nviolating those policies.\n\n274\n00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,956\nAnd not have to worry about a lawsuit\nsaying wrongful termination,\n\n275\n00:12:57,956 --> 00:12:59,076\nyou shouldn't have fired me.\n\n276\n00:12:59,076 --> 00:13:03,528\nWell you sign this AUP and\nthen you violated in my story,\n\n277\n00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:08,763\nwe gave you a second chance even and\nso that's pretty cut and dry.\n\n278\n00:13:08,763 --> 00:13:12,601\n>> One of the things you find with those\nacceptable use policies is a good portion\n\n279\n00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:15,920\nof the policy is not what's allowed,\nit's what's not allowed.\n\n280\n00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,850\nSo you almost want to call\nthe unacceptable use policy.\n\n281\n00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,457\n>> Yeah.\n\n282\n00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:23,237\nSo I've got an acceptable use policy\npull up here from Keuka College and\n\n283\n00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:27,401\nthey've got one layout and this one's\npretty detailed and it is easy to read.\n\n284\n00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:30,675\nThey actually wrote this one in English\ninstead of lawyer speak and acceptable use\n\n285\n00:13:30,675 --> 00:13:33,617\npolicy, that's important because your\nend users do need to read this and\n\n286\n00:13:33,617 --> 00:13:35,437\nthey typically sign it when they're hired.\n\n287\n00:13:35,437 --> 00:13:40,390\nAnd they go through and they specify\nwhat counts as company equipment.\n\n288\n00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,660\nInternet, Intranet,\nExtranet related systems.\n\n289\n00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:48,160\nWhat is defined as a system that\nyou should be allowed to use?\n\n290\n00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,700\nAnd then down here,\nthey start to specify general use.\n\n291\n00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,910\nThe use of Keuka's resources\nis a privilege, not a right.\n\n292\n00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,220\nIn other words,\nyou're not guaranteed computer access.\n\n293\n00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,840\nYou're not guaranteed access to that.\n\n294\n00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,540\nYou may get that privilege but\nit's not a right.\n\n295\n00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,530\nYou're not guaranteed it.\n\n296\n00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,390\nAnd then it says you're responsible for\n\n297\n00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,420\nexercising good judgment regarding\nthe reasonableness of personal use.\n\n298\n00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,050\nIf it's your lunch break and\nyou're browsing eBay,\n\n299\n00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,360\nthat's personal use, you're not doing\nsomething to help the company, and\n\n300\n00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,925\nyou're supposed to use your good judgment,\n\n301\n00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:24,040\nthat's a little bit vague there because\ndifferent people have different judgment.\n\n302\n00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,680\nBut it's kind of setting the grounds for\nthis.\n\n303\n00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,790\nAnd then as you move forward,\n\n304\n00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,860\nyou'll see where it starts to\nlay things out a little more.\n\n305\n00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,640\nYou are responsible for\nkeeping your password secure.\n\n306\n00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,000\nDon't put your password\non a post-it note and\n\n307\n00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,200\nstick it on the computer,\nthat's a violation of the policy.\n\n308\n00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,120\nAll PC laptops should be secured\nif you're going to walk away for\n\n309\n00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,900\nmore than ten minutes,\nthey should be locked.\n\n310\n00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,160\nYour data should be encrypted.\n\n311\n00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,310\nAnd it just keeps laying that\nout to make sure that people\n\n312\n00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,450\nunderstand what they're supposed to do and\nwhat they're not supposed to do.\n\n313\n00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,170\nThey also bring in,\nyou shouldn't conduct any\n\n314\n00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:58,980\ncontact covered in the non-discrimination\nand harassment policies.\n\n315\n00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,433\nSo if you send racially insensitive\nemails or offensive emails that violates\n\n316\n00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:08,470\nthis policy and here's that unacceptable\nuse, it's gonna lay it out.\n\n317\n00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,025\nUnder no circumstances are you\nallowed to do anything\n\n318\n00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:14,635\nthat's considered illegal by law.\n\n319\n00:15:14,635 --> 00:15:19,625\nSo downloading movies by BitTorrent or\nbrowsing the dark Web or\n\n320\n00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:24,145\nwhatever, that's illegal and so you'd be\nin violation of the acceptable use policy.\n\n321\n00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:29,595\nAnd then they've got other activities laid\nout here, trafficking pirated software,\n\n322\n00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:36,060\ncopyrighted material, exporting software,\ntaking company software out.\n\n323\n00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,770\nThey've got pornography,\nchild pornography, hate communications,\n\n324\n00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,640\ndiscriminatory harassment,\nall of these things.\n\n325\n00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,289\nIf you're caught doing\nthese on a company machine,\n\n326\n00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:47,224\nyou're in violation of this policy.\n\n327\n00:15:47,224 --> 00:15:51,090\n>> And as an end user I can't say I didn't\nknow, because this is something that I\n\n328\n00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,905\nhad to sign most likely when\nI got hired by this company.\n\n329\n00:15:53,905 --> 00:15:54,545\n>> Yeah.\n\n330\n00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:57,605\nAnd the part I like best about theirs\nis that enforcement is so small.\n\n331\n00:15:57,605 --> 00:16:00,225\nSome of them have really\nbig enforcement policies.\n\n332\n00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:04,093\nThis one really simple, if you're found\nto violate this you may be subject to\n\n333\n00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:07,710\ndisciplinary action up to and\nincluding terminations in employment.\n\n334\n00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:11,480\nIn other words, we're not going to lay out\nfive steps or a warning series of strikes\n\n335\n00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,340\nor whatever on your first violation\nwe can terminate you, right.\n\n336\n00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,820\nThat's important because if you\nhave somebody who's doing something\n\n337\n00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,930\nlike child pornography.\n\n338\n00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,140\nWell, first off you need to\ncontact the police immediately.\n\n339\n00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,650\nRight, that needs to be step one, and\nstep two, you need to fire them, right.\n\n340\n00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,200\nI mean, that's a given.\n\n341\n00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,120\nSo this is what sets the grounds for\nthat, and\n\n342\n00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,070\nthey can't say it was\nwrongful termination.\n\n343\n00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:31,630\nNo, you violated this.\n\n344\n00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,610\n>> You didn't give me my warning.\n\n345\n00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,030\nYou didn't give me a second chance.\n\n346\n00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,920\nI know it says right here up to and\n\n347\n00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,910\nincluding termination\non the first offense.\n\n348\n00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,080\n>> Yeah.\n\n349\n00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,390\nAll right, now, where things start\nto get a little bit muddied is,\n\n350\n00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,640\nwhat if the person is not your employee?\n\n351\n00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,480\nWhat if they don't work for you?\n\n352\n00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,080\nOr, what if they don't actually\neven set foot in your campus,\n\n353\n00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,380\nthey're accessing your services remotely.\n\n354\n00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,345\nLike, well, University.\n\n355\n00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,825\nThey're a long way away from here.\n\n356\n00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:57,955\nSo, I went to their web site to\npull up this acceptable use policy.\n\n357\n00:16:57,955 --> 00:17:00,885\nSo, their services that they provide.\n\n358\n00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:03,422\nThat are online, or remote, or whatever.\n\n359\n00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:04,312\nI'm on my own computer,\n\n360\n00:17:04,312 --> 00:17:07,412\nI can do whatever I want to my computer\nwhen I'm accessing their services.\n\n361\n00:17:07,412 --> 00:17:11,332\nAnd so for that, the acceptable\nuse policy doesn't really apply.\n\n362\n00:17:11,332 --> 00:17:14,342\nThey don't have any\ncontrols over my computer,\n\n363\n00:17:14,342 --> 00:17:16,372\nI can do whatever I want to my computer.\n\n364\n00:17:16,372 --> 00:17:19,272\nSo you may see a similar\ndocument to this laid out\n\n365\n00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,970\nwith what's called a terms of service.\n\n366\n00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:22,580\nRight.\n\n367\n00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,920\nI'm going to bring up Gooogle's here.\n\n368\n00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,770\nGoogle I think most of us are familiar\nwith that little company named Google.\n\n369\n00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:34,270\nThey have tons of services available and\nthey're all online services, right?\n\n370\n00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:40,000\nSo nobody sits at Google headquarters and\naccesses this stuff, they all access it\n\n371\n00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,210\nvia, you know, the the web or whatever and\nso they have a terms of service that says,\n\n372\n00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:48,400\nif you're going to use our online services\n,yes you're on your own computer and\n\n373\n00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,470\nyes ,you're on your own\ninternet connection you are,\n\n374\n00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:55,120\nyour own person with rights, but here's\nwhat we expect you to do while you're\n\n375\n00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,070\nusing our services ,if you are using\nG-Mail or Blogger or YouTube or whatever.\n\n376\n00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,600\nHere's the terms of services.\n\n377\n00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,020\nAnd we're going to lay out\nour commitment to you.\n\n378\n00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,290\nSo what Google is promising you, and\n\n379\n00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:11,010\nthen what you need to do if you\nwant to keep using Google services.\n\n380\n00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:11,640\nRight?\n\n381\n00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,460\nVery similar to an acceptable use policy.\n\n382\n00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:14,960\nRight?\n\n383\n00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,330\nAnd just right off the bat here.\n\n384\n00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,315\nDon't misuse our services.\n\n385\n00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:19,230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Period.\n\n386\n00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,480\nRight?\nProbably the shortest sentence of this\n\n387\n00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,125\nwhole document.\n\n388\n00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Easy to understand though, right?\n\n389\n00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,540\nDon't interfere with the services,\ndon't access them in a method\n\n390\n00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,240\nother than what was originally\nprovided in the instructions.\n\n391\n00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,900\nWe have a certain way we expect\nyou to use our services.\n\n392\n00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,830\nStay within that, all right?\n\n393\n00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,160\nAnd then just lay out,\nhere's your Google account and\n\n394\n00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,550\nwhat you need to do to maintain that.\n\n395\n00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,620\nPrivacy, copyright protection,\nyour content,\n\n396\n00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,680\nanything upload into G-Mail\nright all your e-mails up there.\n\n397\n00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,240\nWhat can you expect of that, right.\n\n398\n00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,270\nWhat are you allowed to have and\nwhat's Google allowed to access,\n\n399\n00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:54,400\nit's all right here in the terms and\nservices, right.\n\n400\n00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,345\nBy using their services you're\nagreeing to follow this.\n\n401\n00:18:58,345 --> 00:18:59,855\nHence, the terms of service\nis pretty important.\n\n402\n00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:04,075\nIt's just like an AUP, except it's for\nservices that you typically access\n\n403\n00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:07,995\nremotely that aren't,\nyou are in control of your own equipment.\n\n404\n00:19:07,995 --> 00:19:10,125\nIt's not from that company.\n\n405\n00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:10,845\n>> Yeah.\nAnother big\n\n406\n00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:13,255\npart of these is a lot of times\nthat disclaimer that comes up.\n\n407\n00:19:13,255 --> 00:19:17,110\nIn fact, sometimes the terms of\nservice is just a disclaimer.\n\n408\n00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,430\nNow where if you buy a piece of software,\nor you use somebody's service like that,\n\n409\n00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,500\nand then you perform\nsome illegal activities\n\n410\n00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,100\nthat make sure that entity\ncan't be held responsible.\n\n411\n00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,460\n>> Now that, I'm kind of glad\nyou mentioned software there.\n\n412\n00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,160\nIf you buy software, I think we've all\ninstalled it, you install software and\n\n413\n00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,210\nyou get this huge legal\nagreement at the beginning.\n\n414\n00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,300\nThe thing about software is we\naren't always the ones who buy it.\n\n415\n00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,480\nSo for example,\non my computer I have Microsoft Office.\n\n416\n00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,730\nWell, I didn't buy it, I didn't buy\nMicrosoft Office, my company did.\n\n417\n00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:50,010\nSo technically they bought the software,\n\n418\n00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,570\nthey're the ones who entered into\na legal agreement with Microsoft.\n\n419\n00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,600\nWhen they bought that software,\nbut I'm the one who uses it.\n\n420\n00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,020\nI didn't enter into an agreement\nwith Microsoft about that, right?\n\n421\n00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,630\nThat's not me.\n\n422\n00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,670\nWell, there's still acceptable use or\n\n423\n00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,700\nterms of service that\nkinda come into play.\n\n424\n00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,225\nAnd so, for that,\nthey created another document.\n\n425\n00:20:08,225 --> 00:20:10,100\n[LAUGH] This guy right here.\n\n426\n00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,640\nWhich, actually, let me kinda rearrange\nthis on my screen, 'cuz this one's.\n\n427\n00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,980\nThis was pretty close to fine print here.\n\n428\n00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:19,455\nAll right so this guy this is an end\nuser license agreement this is from\n\n429\n00:20:19,455 --> 00:20:23,585\ntypography.com is another company\nthat is a web based service and\n\n430\n00:20:23,585 --> 00:20:28,000\ntypography.com, you go to the website\nyou can use it you all sorts of stuff.\n\n431\n00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,550\nThey make it where if you're an end user,\nif you're gonna use their site,\n\n432\n00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:37,870\nthen here's what you commit to, right,\nhere's your end user license agreement.\n\n433\n00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,100\nAnd this is setting aside two things,\nright.\n\n434\n00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,188\nOne, how you're allowed to use the system.\n\n435\n00:20:42,188 --> 00:20:48,630\nAnd two,\nthe kind of protections that they get.\n\n436\n00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,470\nIf you're using their site and something\nhappens and your computer explodes,\n\n437\n00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,030\nthat's not their fault.\n\n438\n00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,190\nThey're not gonna be covering that,\nthat's your problem.\n\n439\n00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,850\nRight.\n\n440\n00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,320\nOr if you save data on their site and\nthey lose it.\n\n441\n00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,110\nWell that's not their fault they're not\nguaranteeing that they'll save your\n\n442\n00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,000\ndata, right?\n\n443\n00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,100\nThere's a liability when you provide a\nservice online there's a liability there.\n\n444\n00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,290\nThe liability is like I use Gmail for\nsome of my personal email and\n\n445\n00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,920\nif Gmail goes off line I can't\nget to my personal email.\n\n446\n00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,220\nSo maybe I sue Google.\n\n447\n00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,790\nI'm like, hey, you guys didn't work\nhard enough to keep my email online.\n\n448\n00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:22,370\nNever mind the fact that I'm getting\nit for free, but maybe I sue anyway.\n\n449\n00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:27,230\nSo they might have some kind of, what do\nyou call it, indemnity or anti indemnity\n\n450\n00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:32,570\nclause or whatever, where they come in and\nthey say, we're not a liable for that.\n\n451\n00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,040\nYeah, we're giving you a service free and\n\n452\n00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,070\nif it goes off line,\nwell that's what happens.\n\n453\n00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:40,820\nAnd we'll make our best effort to keep the\nsystem online, but at the end of the day,\n\n454\n00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,370\nyou're not paying us so\nwe're not gonna give you a guarantee.\n\n455\n00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,970\nNow you can pay Google.\n\n456\n00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,940\nYou can sign up for Google apps for\nwork, or Google apps for business.\n\n457\n00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,630\nAnd with those guys you do get a service\nlevel that says we will be online, and\n\n458\n00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,150\nthey do take responsibility for that.\n\n459\n00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,470\nWith a free service, you just have\nan end user license agreement.\n\n460\n00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:03,010\nIt says what's expected of you and\nwhat they're not held responsible for.\n\n461\n00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,360\nSo, it's all basically, and\nif we kinda browse through here, this And\n\n462\n00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,540\nhis license agreements are almost\nalways written legally.\n\n463\n00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,550\nSo the whole first part\nyours is definition, right?\n\n464\n00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,500\nWhat counts as a document?\n\n465\n00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,450\nWhat counts as embedded software files?\n\n466\n00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,090\nWhat is H&Co Properties?\n\n467\n00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,550\nWhat are image files?\n\n468\n00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,020\nIt away that out,\nbecause when I say image file,\n\n469\n00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,610\nwe may have different perceptions\nof what counts as that.\n\n470\n00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,460\nI might say, it's not an image,\nthat's actually a video or, you know,\n\n471\n00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,370\nyou get some kind of argument there.\n\n472\n00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,480\nSo you just lay it out.\n\n473\n00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,040\nHere's what counts as an image, here's\nwhat counts as licensed software, and\n\n474\n00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,260\nthen after that for the whole\nrest of the document, here we go.\n\n475\n00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,530\nYou see I'm about a third way through this\ndocument, I just got past the definitions.\n\n476\n00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:44,230\nNow they start to lay out all\nright who's allowed to install,\n\n477\n00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,100\nI mean I'm allowed to\ninstall on one computer.\n\n478\n00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,680\nRight.\n\n479\n00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:53,400\nOne or more computers specify that I'm\nin my applicable order summary, right?\n\n480\n00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,970\nWhat does that mean?\n\n481\n00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,860\nWell when I order there was an order\nsummary to specify how many computers I\n\n482\n00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,590\ncould install on.\n\n483\n00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,070\nSo I had to stay within that limit.\n\n484\n00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,370\nIf I acced it I'm violating my\nend user license agreement right.\n\n485\n00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,450\nYou get a certain amount of installs but\n\n486\n00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,540\nI'm allowed to maintain a backup copy,\nright?\n\n487\n00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,550\nSo I could have a backup copy\nof the software stored somewhere\n\n488\n00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,620\neven though I've already hit my limit\nof computers that I can install on.\n\n489\n00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,270\nWe get an iOS device.\n\n490\n00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:20,670\nIt's just laying out that commitment,\nwhat you get when you use their software.\n\n491\n00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,770\nIt's just extremely boring.\n\n492\n00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:26,170\nThey're hard to read because\nof the definitions, but\n\n493\n00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,130\nit is kind of an agreement that you're\nmaking when you run that software\n\n494\n00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,390\nthat says here's what we're going to do.\n\n495\n00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,720\nNow I'll tell you guys there's\na little known fact about end user\n\n496\n00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,820\nlicense agreements.\n\n497\n00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,570\nTo date,\n\n498\n00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:41,080\nI am unaware of a single case where\nthey've actually been upheld in court,\n\n499\n00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,576\nso they're not really legally binding but\nthey do count as due diligence.\n\n500\n00:23:45,576 --> 00:23:49,761\nSo the software manufactors just by\nhaving these, they're basically saying,\n\n501\n00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,924\nwe express to the end user what to expect.\n\n502\n00:23:51,924 --> 00:23:56,484\nAnd so when something went wrong, they\nmight sue us, and the court might say,\n\n503\n00:23:56,484 --> 00:23:58,224\nyeah, and utilize the EULA.\n\n504\n00:23:58,224 --> 00:24:00,144\nIt doesn't excuse you from a lawsuit.\n\n505\n00:24:00,144 --> 00:24:04,010\nBut you did warn them, so you win.\n\n506\n00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,100\nYou're not gonna be liable.\n\n507\n00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,390\nAnd then that's how most of\nthe cases have been is they go in\n\n508\n00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,800\nthe benefit of the software manufacturer,\ncuz they did their due diligence.\n\n509\n00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,990\nThey warned you.\n\n510\n00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,240\nBut it's not that this was\na legally binding document.\n\n511\n00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,290\nIt's just them expressing that\nthere were limits to the software.\n\n512\n00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,475\n>> Yeah, hard to make it legally binding,\n\n513\n00:24:19,475 --> 00:24:20,960\ncuz you don't know who's\nclicking that button.\n\n514\n00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,720\nYou don't know if they're a minor for\nexample, or something like that, or\n\n515\n00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,560\nthe legitimate owner of that software.\n\n516\n00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,180\n>> So many people share computers.\n\n517\n00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,879\nMaybe I installed the software and I\nagreed, and then Mike's using my computer,\n\n518\n00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:32,820\nand that software deletes his documents.\n\n519\n00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,430\nWell, he didn't do that agreement, right?\n\n520\n00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,980\nHe wasn't a party to that agreement.\n\n521\n00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,230\nSo where's that fault at?\n\n522\n00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,300\nThat's why they get kinda\nwishy-washy in court.\n\n523\n00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,810\nBut boy are these things common.\n\n524\n00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:45,245\nAny software you install's gonna\nhave a EULA attached to it.\n\n525\n00:24:45,245 --> 00:24:46,470\n>> Absolutely.\n\n526\n00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:50,420\nAnd then another one you mentioned,\nDon, just a minute ago, is that SLA or\n\n527\n00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,890\nthat Service Level Agreement.\n\n528\n00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,310\nA little bit different there, right?\n\n529\n00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,010\n>> Yeah, when you pay for a service.\n\n530\n00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:00,172\nLike your internet service, or power,\nor cable television, or whatever.\n\n531\n00:25:00,172 --> 00:25:01,890\nOften times they'll give you\na service level agreement.\n\n532\n00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:05,890\nThey'll say we guarantee your cable\ntelevision will work 99% of the time.\n\n533\n00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,890\nAnd so if you have a failure, well,\n\n534\n00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:14,845\nif it falls within that one percent of\navailability that they specified, or\n\n535\n00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:17,315\nlack of availability, that's okay,\nthat's in the contract.\n\n536\n00:25:18,515 --> 00:25:21,035\nBut if it exceeds that 1%\nthen what happens, right?\n\n537\n00:25:22,325 --> 00:25:25,005\nMaybe they credit your account,\nyou get a discount.\n\n538\n00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:27,055\nMaybe they increase your bandwidth or\n\n539\n00:25:27,055 --> 00:25:29,455\nwhatever, there's some kind of\npenalty that's associated with it.\n\n540\n00:25:29,455 --> 00:25:32,145\nSo the SLA's are like targets\nthat they have to hit.\n\n541\n00:25:32,145 --> 00:25:34,540\nFree services rarely have SLA's.\n\n542\n00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,540\nBut paid services almost always do.\n\n543\n00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,850\nAnd if they don't, they should.\n\n544\n00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,650\nRight?\nFind a different provider.\n\n545\n00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,900\nSo if you're paying for\nit you should get certain guarantees.\n\n546\n00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,000\nAnd they might not be the greatest\nguarantees in the world.\n\n547\n00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,810\nSLAs, they normally have what\nare called the nines-of-availability.\n\n548\n00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:56,240\nAnd let me, there's a Wikipedia article\nwhere they do all the math for us here,\n\n549\n00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,940\nso we'll use that.\n\n550\n00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,790\nI don't normally like\nto reference Wikipedia.\n\n551\n00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,773\nBut when somebody comes in and says hey,\n\n552\n00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:06,210\nI'm gonna give you five\nnines-of-availability.\n\n553\n00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,990\nWell, actually let's go back\nto my example which is 99%.\n\n554\n00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:11,476\nIf somebody says 99% availability,\nthat sounds like a lot.\n\n555\n00:26:11,476 --> 00:26:12,828\n>> It does.\n>> That sounds like that system's always\n\n556\n00:26:12,828 --> 00:26:13,380\ngonna be available.\n\n557\n00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,560\n>> That's fantastic.\n\n558\n00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,525\n>> It's really not that good.\n\n559\n00:26:15,525 --> 00:26:17,620\n99% of availability,\n\n560\n00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:23,340\nif you work that out over an entire\nyear is 3.65 days of down time.\n\n561\n00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,216\nRight?\nSo imagine if your cable television had\n\n562\n00:26:26,216 --> 00:26:28,690\na 99% up time and\nthen it went down for three and\n\n563\n00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:32,400\na half days, would you be frustrated not\nwatching TV for three and a half days?\n\n564\n00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,020\n>> Absolutely.\n\n565\n00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,330\n>> Or if your power went out for\nthree and a half days.\n\n566\n00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,380\nYour internet connectivity went out for\nthree and a half days, that's a lot.\n\n567\n00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,970\nSo 99% of the time,\nit's actually pretty easy to achieve.\n\n568\n00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,570\nHarder yet, though, are like five nines.\n\n569\n00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,960\nAnd when people say\nthey're highly available,\n\n570\n00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,280\na lot of times they're talking\nabout that five nines.\n\n571\n00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,580\nWith 99.999% uptime,\nyou can be down 5.26 minutes per year.\n\n572\n00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,520\nThat's much smaller, right?\n\n573\n00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,250\nAnd that's kinda the target people hit.\n\n574\n00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:01,060\nSo when you get an SLA, this is what\ntheir normally talking about is\n\n575\n00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,450\nhow many nines of availability\nare they going to promise you,\n\n576\n00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,508\nand if they don't meet it, what happens,\nwhat do they do to compensate?\n\n577\n00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:11,470\n>> These SLAs, a lot of times,\nare between say I purchase a service from\n\n578\n00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,270\na provider they can also be used\nin-house between departments as well.\n\n579\n00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,310\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and this is a great\nexample right here from the University of\n\n580\n00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:22,810\nTexas at Austin where they put\nout SLA's to their own employees.\n\n581\n00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:27,190\nAnd they say basically,\nwhen you call Tier 1 tech support,\n\n582\n00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:31,140\nthey want your call to be answered by\na live person 70% of the time, right?\n\n583\n00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,640\nIf there's so\n\n584\n00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,860\nmany calls going to tech support that\nmost of them are going to voicemail.\n\n585\n00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,810\nIf more than 30% of the voicemail,\nthey violate their SLA.\n\n586\n00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,410\nAnd that means they need\nto hire more help desk,\n\n587\n00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,210\nget more people in there\nanswering the phone.\n\n588\n00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:47,880\nSo they wanna make sure that 70% of\nthe calls are answered by a person.\n\n589\n00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,670\nAnd then when somebody calls,\nthey wanna ensure that 60%,\n\n590\n00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:56,770\nmore than half of their calls,\nare resolved in that first phone call.\n\n591\n00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:59,480\nHave you ever had a support call where\nat the end they say, all right, well,\n\n592\n00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,883\nwe're gonna have to call you back, right?\n\n593\n00:28:00,883 --> 00:28:02,361\nThat's bad, I hate it when that happens.\n\n594\n00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:04,940\nThat means they're not\ngonna fix my problem.\n\n595\n00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:09,130\nBut if you get somebody who's trained,\nwho knows the environment,\n\n596\n00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,240\nwho can help you and\nsolve it all within the first call,\n\n597\n00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,410\nthat's a good experience, and they're\nlooking to do that 60% of the time.\n\n598\n00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:17,890\nThat's a commitment they're making\nto their own employees right?\n\n599\n00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,880\nPeople inside of that organization.\n\n600\n00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,450\nSo you'll see people\npublish stuff like this.\n\n601\n00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,630\nThis is internal,\n\n602\n00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,930\nit could be an external agreement you have\nwith your Internet provider or whoever.\n\n603\n00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,930\nThese service level agreements\nare just a great way to measure that.\n\n604\n00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:34,130\nIt's another type of procedure, or policy\ndocument, that you'll see in your company.\n\n605\n00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,060\n>> Yeah, it seems like that EULA\nis really protecting the company\n\n606\n00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,160\nthat's providing that service or software.\n\n607\n00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,490\nAnd the SLA is kind of protecting the\nconsumer of that service or that software.\n\n608\n00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:47,240\n>> Yeah, and you'll see them combine\ntoo where you have all of these, right?\n\n609\n00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,030\nYou might have security policy, terms\nof service, end user license agreement,\n\n610\n00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,850\nacceptable use policy, SLAs.\n\n611\n00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:58,380\nYou have all of these available for\na single solution, it gets kind of crazy.\n\n612\n00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,980\nBut it's necessary, right,\n\n613\n00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,680\nto ensure that you get the level\nof service that you want.\n\n614\n00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,210\nThat they're protected legally,\nthat everybody maintains their rights.\n\n615\n00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,520\nAnd everybody understands what\ntheir responsibilities are within\n\n616\n00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,410\nthat environment.\n\n617\n00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,260\n>> That's fantastic.\n\n618\n00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,420\nAnd really cleared up a lot of questions\nwe have about all these different legal\n\n619\n00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,740\ndocuments that keep popping up when I\nbuy software, when I purchase a service.\n\n620\n00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,320\nAnd now we should have a better idea\nof what those documents are for,\n\n621\n00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,590\nwhy we have to go through the pain\nof reading some of those documents.\n\n622\n00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:30,750\nWhy we always have to click I Accept when\nwe buy software and things like that.\n\n623\n00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,330\nSo anything else we wanna throw\nin here before we wrap it up?\n\n624\n00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,390\n>> That's pretty much it.\n\n625\n00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:35,900\nJust remember,\n\n626\n00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,430\nas boring as these documents are,\neverybody plays a part in them, right?\n\n627\n00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:43,090\nAnd even if you just got hired on\nas a mail clerk for a company,\n\n628\n00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,510\nthese security policies and\nthings, they pertain to you, too.\n\n629\n00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,880\nYou need to participate in that and\n\n630\n00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,321\nunderstand what your role\nis within that policy.\n\n631\n00:29:52,321 --> 00:29:53,650\n>> Very good.\n\n632\n00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:57,240\nAll right well we hope you guys enjoyed\nwatching the episode as much as we had\n\n633\n00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,570\nfilming the episode.\n\n634\n00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:01,148\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n635\n00:30:01,148 --> 00:30:02,118\nAnd I'm Don Pezet.\n\n636\n00:30:02,118 --> 00:30:03,633\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n637\n00:30:03,633 -->
