ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,960\nI'm your host, Don Pezet, and\nI've got our resident security expert,\n\n4\n00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,470\nMike Roderick, here with me.\n\n5\n00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,990\nAnd we're about to embark upon a journey,\na journey of IT security or\n\n6\n00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,690\ninformation security and\nall of the things that a regular,\n\n7\n00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,860\naverage, run-of-the-mill employee needs\nto be familiar with if you're going to\n\n8\n00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,520\nbe using computers and\nmore importantly using the Internet.\n\n9\n00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,600\nThere's a lot of pitfalls and things that\nwe need to watch out for out there, and\n\n10\n00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,590\nthe information security\numbrella is a big one.\n\n11\n00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,880\nIt covers a lot of different topics.\n\n12\n00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,040\nSo that's what we're gonna be tackling as\nwe go through this series, each episode,\n\n13\n00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,790\ngrabbing different areas of\nwhat we need to be aware of.\n\n14\n00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,270\nAnd boy, there's a lot we need to\nbe aware of, isn't there, Mike?\n\n15\n00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,620\n>> There really is, Don.\n\n16\n00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,830\nAnd before we dive into all\nthose different things,\n\n17\n00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,580\nI think one of the things we want\nto make sure we have is a good\n\n18\n00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,820\nfoundational knowledge\nabout information security.\n\n19\n00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,630\nWe talk about security and\nthe need for it, but what do we mean?\n\n20\n00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,650\nWhat do we mean by that\nfoundational security?\n\n21\n00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,590\nThere are several different\nmodels out there that we can use,\n\n22\n00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:17,400\nand one of the most common ones\nis known as the CIA triad.\n\n23\n00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,260\nNow when I talk about that,\n\n24\n00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,380\nI'm not referring to\nthe Central Intelligence Agency\n\n25\n00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,380\nthat we find here in the US or\nanything like that.\n\n26\n00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,530\nThe CIA triad is a very accepted\nsecurity model that allows us to\n\n27\n00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,490\nkind of test or verify that our\nsecurity methods and policies\n\n28\n00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,970\nthat we put in place in an organization\nare doing what they're supposed to do,\n\n29\n00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,530\nand they're indeed keeping\nour information safe.\n\n30\n00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,020\nThey call it the CIA triad.\n\n31\n00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,430\nIt's got three main points,\nhence the name triad.\n\n32\n00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,660\nAnd the C stands for confidentiality,\n\n33\n00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,470\nthe I is going to be integrity,\nand the A is for availability.\n\n34\n00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:59,800\nAll three of those are very key components\nwhen it comes to information security.\n\n35\n00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,470\n>> And it's important that we at least\nhave a basic grasp of what each of those\n\n36\n00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,560\nthree ideas are,\n\n37\n00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,080\nbecause information security more than\nlikely expands beyond what you think of.\n\n38\n00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,900\nWhen people think of information security,\nthey think of stuff we do on computers,\n\n39\n00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,120\nright, anti-virus, firewalls.\n\n40\n00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,250\nBut it expands even beyond that to things\nlike locked doors and insurance policies\n\n41\n00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,100\nand things you wouldn't even normally\nassociate with computers, but are equally\n\n42\n00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,810\nimportant to maintaining a functioning,\nsafe and secure IT environment.\n\n43\n00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,270\nSo Mike, let's break each one of these\ndown and give everybody kind of an idea of\n\n44\n00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,040\nwhat they mean, what they do,\nwhy they're important.\n\n45\n00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,446\nAnd let's start off with confidentiality.\n\n46\n00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,755\n>> All right, it's a good place to start.\n\n47\n00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:38,570\nIt's one of the more easy ones,\nI think, for people to understand.\n\n48\n00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,990\nThey might have dealt with\nthis in one way or the other.\n\n49\n00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:46,420\nConfidentiality, as you're probably aware,\njust means making sure that the data or\n\n50\n00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:50,950\nwhatever it is we're trying to\nprotect remains confidential.\n\n51\n00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,200\nIn other words,\nonly the authorized people or\n\n52\n00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:00,395\nentities have access to that information,\nwhether that's data or access to\n\n53\n00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:05,155\nthe server closet or something like that,\nkeeping that information confidential.\n\n54\n00:03:05,155 --> 00:03:08,435\n>> And that's pretty challenging\nbecause in the early days of computing,\n\n55\n00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:09,425\nnetworks were small.\n\n56\n00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:11,265\nYou only had a couple of computers.\n\n57\n00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:14,155\nThey were private inside\nindividual businesses, and\n\n58\n00:03:14,155 --> 00:03:17,095\nyou didn't have to worry about somebody\nintercepting your data as it moved between\n\n59\n00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:19,615\nmachines that were right\nthere in the same room.\n\n60\n00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:22,060\nAnd so as we grew and\nthe Internet developed,\n\n61\n00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,850\na lot of those technologies were not\nprepared to hide or secure your data.\n\n62\n00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,310\nAnd so\ntechnologies we use every day like email,\n\n63\n00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,630\nemail is sent across\nthe Internet in plain text.\n\n64\n00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,010\nAnybody could intercept that and\nread your email.\n\n65\n00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:38,430\nIt is not a secure\ncommunication mechanism.\n\n66\n00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,360\nSo we've had to take additional\nsteps to secure our data,\n\n67\n00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,210\nto protect it, and\nthat's what confidentiality is all about.\n\n68\n00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,680\nIf I send an email to Mike, I want to\nmake sure that only Mike can read that.\n\n69\n00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,160\nI don't want just anybody to be\nable to grab that and read it.\n\n70\n00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,350\nOr if it's my mortgage documents,\nmy banking, tax records,\n\n71\n00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,100\nwhatever, I want to make sure that\nI can keep that data private.\n\n72\n00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,200\nAnd that's what\nconfidentiality is all about.\n\n73\n00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,910\n>> Exactly.\nThere's several different things we can\n\n74\n00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,560\nuse to provide that confidentiality.\n\n75\n00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,060\nOne of the big ones is\ngoing to be encryption.\n\n76\n00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,590\nEncryption allows me to take something.\n\n77\n00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,540\nWe use these fancy terms.\n\n78\n00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,110\nWe take something called plain\ntext which is human readable and\n\n79\n00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,790\nconvert it into something\nwe call cipher text.\n\n80\n00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,460\nWhich means in order to read it I'm gonna\nneed the appropriate key to decrypt and\n\n81\n00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,370\nretrieve that plain text back out.\n\n82\n00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,260\nAnd it's one of the most common ways\nto provide that confidentiality.\n\n83\n00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,900\nBecause if you don't have access to the\nkey then you're not gonna be able to get\n\n84\n00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,430\naccess to that data.\n\n85\n00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,050\nI can show you a real quick\nexample here of some encryption.\n\n86\n00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,240\nWhat I've got on my screen here\nis just a spreadsheet, and\n\n87\n00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,980\nI've made a basic cipher algorithm.\n\n88\n00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,840\nThis is,\nif you're familiar with encryption,\n\n89\n00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,340\nthis is what's known as a Caesar cipher.\n\n90\n00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,720\nIt's just a shift in characters.\n\n91\n00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,180\nAcross the top, I have our English\nalphabet, my letters here.\n\n92\n00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,670\nOn the next row you can see it's the same\nalphabet but everything is shifted over,\n\n93\n00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,050\nin this case by three characters, and\n\n94\n00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,510\nthen at the end it wraps\nback around after the Z.\n\n95\n00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,650\nWe go back to the A, B and C.\n\n96\n00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,350\nAnd all I'm going to do\nto do the encryption\n\n97\n00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,250\nis to find the letter I'm looking for\nacross that top row.\n\n98\n00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,150\nLet's say I want to encrypt the letter K.\n\n99\n00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,850\nWell, the letter K simply becomes an N,\nall right?\n\n100\n00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,970\nSo if we take an example here, I've got my\nplain text, my human readable hello world.\n\n101\n00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,400\nMy cipher text then,\nthe first letter would be an h.\n\n102\n00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,960\nAnd if I look at the h, that becomes a k.\n\n103\n00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,460\nSo you can see the first letter\nof my cipher text is a k.\n\n104\n00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,722\nThe next letter was an e,\nwhich becomes an h, so there's my h, and\n\n105\n00:05:37,722 --> 00:05:42,800\non down the road proceeding letter\nby letter through that plain text.\n\n106\n00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,250\nSo now this is known as my cipher text.\n\n107\n00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,990\nThis is my encrypted form.\n\n108\n00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,930\nAnd if you didn't know,\nif I was to erase this.\n\n109\n00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,560\nYou didn't know what\nthe original text was and\n\n110\n00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,570\nif you didn't know what algorithm,\nwhat method I use to encrypt that data or\n\n111\n00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,440\nthe key I used, more specifically, then\nyou would not be able to read that data.\n\n112\n00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,630\nIf you know the key, though,\n\n113\n00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,850\nif you know I shifted three characters\nto the right, all you would have to do\n\n114\n00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,810\nthen to decrypt it would be to shift\nthree characters back to the left.\n\n115\n00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,380\nSo you would just do the opposite.\n\n116\n00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,490\nA k then would go back to an h,\nand on down the row.\n\n117\n00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,230\nAnd you can get\nthe original text back out.\n\n118\n00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,800\nBut if you don't know the key,\nyou're not gonna get access or\n\n119\n00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,320\nyou're not gonna get that data.\n\n120\n00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,240\n>> Yeah, now what Mike just showed\nyou guys is a very simple cipher,\n\n121\n00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,730\none we could do in our head.\n\n122\n00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,790\nThe ciphers that your computer\nuses are far more advanced.\n\n123\n00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:39,140\nUsing hundreds or even thousands of bits\nof encryption security to be able to give\n\n124\n00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:44,490\nyou cipher text that is near impossible\nto reverse unless you've got that key.\n\n125\n00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,770\nSo every time you browse to a website and\nit goes to a secure connection,\n\n126\n00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,000\nthat little lock appears.\n\n127\n00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,340\nOr every time you fire up\nyour company VPN connection.\n\n128\n00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,420\nAny time you do that kind of stuff,\nyou're doing really strong encryption\n\n129\n00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,480\non the back-end that would be very,\nvery difficult for somebody to break in.\n\n130\n00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,095\nAnd that means any data you transmit\nover that connection is confidential.\n\n131\n00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:10,410\nOnly you and the person you're\nconnecting to will be able to read and\n\n132\n00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,040\nunderstand that data\nbecause you have that key.\n\n133\n00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,080\nEverybody else just sees garbled gibberish\non the network and your data is safe.\n\n134\n00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,150\nSo inside of the information\nsecurity world,\n\n135\n00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,370\nconfidentiality is one of the things\nthat we've got to provide.\n\n136\n00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,303\nEverything that we do in terms of\ninformation security should contribute to\n\n137\n00:07:29,303 --> 00:07:33,090\nat least one of the three little\ncontents of the CIA triad.\n\n138\n00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:36,432\nVPNs, SSL,\nthey all contribute to confidentiality.\n\n139\n00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:39,460\n>> And encryption's not the only way\nthat we provide confidentiality.\n\n140\n00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,410\nIn fact, just using your user ID and\npassword, right?\n\n141\n00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,700\nWhen you log onto your system at work,\nyou've got your My Documents and\n\n142\n00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,340\nthose other folders that\nonly you have access to.\n\n143\n00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,810\nOnce you log on, you get access to those.\n\n144\n00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,861\nI don't have access to those, for example.\n\n145\n00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:55,431\nYour coworkers can't get into\nyour My Documents folder.\n\n146\n00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:57,261\nSo that ID, that username and\n\n147\n00:07:57,261 --> 00:08:00,931\npassword is providing a layer\nOf confidentiality as well.\n\n148\n00:08:00,931 --> 00:08:03,281\nAccess control is Donner\ndoing the same thing.\n\n149\n00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:07,820\nWe go to a resource and\nsay an NTFS partition.\n\n150\n00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,120\nWe can control who has read and\nwho has right, who has full control and\n\n151\n00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,260\nthings like that.\n\n152\n00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,990\nThat is again, giving us another\nlevel of confidentiality.\n\n153\n00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,230\nRemember confidentiality doesn't\nnecessarily mean you don't get access to\n\n154\n00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,260\nthe data at all.\n\n155\n00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,770\nBut I can control what level\nof access you have too.\n\n156\n00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,430\nSo that's another part of confidentiality\nand we talk about security.\n\n157\n00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,730\nWe're always gonna talk about layers of\ndefense having more than one layer so\n\n158\n00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,162\nwe can start combining\nthese methods as well.\n\n159\n00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:36,812\nYou're gonna have to have\na password to log on to my system.\n\n160\n00:08:36,812 --> 00:08:39,798\nYou're gonna have to have\npermissions to access that file, and\n\n161\n00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:42,510\nyou're gonna need the key\nto decrypt that file.\n\n162\n00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,780\nSo we can add all three\nof those layers for\n\n163\n00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,570\nexample, to provide that confidentiality\nfor that particular document.\n\n164\n00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,570\n>> And don't forget the low tech\nsolutions that factor into this.\n\n165\n00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,090\nIf I want to keep my computer safe,\n\n166\n00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,220\nit might be as simple as locking\nthe door to my office, right?\n\n167\n00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,230\nNow, somebody can't physically get\nin the room where my computer is and\n\n168\n00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,720\nmy data stays private or\n\n169\n00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,190\nwhen I'm throwing papers away that I\nprinted I run them through a shredder.\n\n170\n00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,360\nThat shredder is part of what's providing\nconfidentiality, nobody is gonna be able\n\n171\n00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,920\nto read these documents cause I've\ndestroyed them at this point.\n\n172\n00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,890\nSo confidentiality is a big area, and\n\n173\n00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,850\nin information security we're\nsecuring the information.\n\n174\n00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,130\nWe're not securing technology.\n\n175\n00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,740\nWe're not securing just our computer.\n\n176\n00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,460\nIt's the information in all of its forms,\nand that's why it's such a big topic.\n\n177\n00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,690\n>> Exactly.\n\n178\n00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,770\nAll right, and if we move on into our\ntriad then we got confidentiality.\n\n179\n00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,730\nThat's our first leg of our triad.\n\n180\n00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,910\nThe next leg is gonna be\nsomething known as integrity.\n\n181\n00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,170\nAnd really if we wanna define\nintegrity in a simple way,\n\n182\n00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,100\nit just means to make sure that the data,\n\n183\n00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,690\nthe information is not modified\neither maliciously or accidentally.\n\n184\n00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,940\nIt doesn't have to be\nan intentional attack.\n\n185\n00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,900\nAll right, we could have data\ncorruption and things like that.\n\n186\n00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,050\nSo integrity is all about making\nsure that the data is not modified,\n\n187\n00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,605\nthat it remains as it was intended.\n\n188\n00:09:54,605 --> 00:09:58,650\n>> Yeah, if you're using\na network like the Internet,\n\n189\n00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,940\nyou're passing across routers\nthat you don't control,\n\n190\n00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,460\nthat you don't necessarily even know\nthe companies that are involved in.\n\n191\n00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,780\nSo you may pass across 10,\n15 different routers, that means 10 or\n\n192\n00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,780\n15 different Internet service providers.\n\n193\n00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,370\nAnybody along that journey\ncould intercept your traffic.\n\n194\n00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,830\nWell it's bad enough they intercept it and\nread it, but\n\n195\n00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,740\nif they want to go really bad.\n\n196\n00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,020\nThey can modify that traffic and\nthen send it along and\n\n197\n00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,140\nit looks like it came from you but it's\nbeen modified beyond your original intent.\n\n198\n00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,180\nThat means the integrity has\nbeen broken for your data.\n\n199\n00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,320\nWe need ways to validate that integrity to\nensure that our information hasn't been\n\n200\n00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,000\ntampered with.\n\n201\n00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,150\nAnd there's a number of technologies\nout there that can do it.\n\n202\n00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,830\nSo Mike, you've got an example\nof like an integrity violation.\n\n203\n00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,640\n>> I do, exactly.\n\n204\n00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,220\nI've got a simple little drawing I drew\nup here in this is a great example.\n\n205\n00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,590\nThis is what can happen out\nthere in the real world.\n\n206\n00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:50,420\nI've got a situation where Alice wants\nto send a check say over to Adam.\n\n207\n00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,230\nSo initially she writes this check and\nit says, pay to Adam the amount of $100.\n\n208\n00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,970\nBut somewhere during\nthe transmission of that information\n\n209\n00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,960\nwe can see there was\nan unauthorized modification.\n\n210\n00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,160\nAnd when that check is to the other end,\nall of a sudden it says\n\n211\n00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,370\nnot Adam getting a $100, but\nit says Don is retrieving a 100,000.\n\n212\n00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,840\nWait, did you change that on?\n\n213\n00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,488\n>> I love this example.\n\n214\n00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:12,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's my favorite example in\n\n215\n00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,610\nthe whole show.\n\n216\n00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:18,335\n>> Somehow, Don became the recipient\nof that $100,000 check there but\n\n217\n00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:21,842\nthat's a great example of\nwhere integrity was not kept.\n\n218\n00:11:21,842 --> 00:11:22,920\n>> Right.\n\n219\n00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,650\n>> We lost our integrity\non that information.\n\n220\n00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,554\n>> So one great way that we can ensure\nthat integrity is through the use of\n\n221\n00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,270\nsomething called a digital signature.\n\n222\n00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:34,945\nAnd a digital signature is where we run\nlike a little mathematical algorithm\n\n223\n00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:38,590\nagainst the data and\nit creates a certain number.\n\n224\n00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,660\nAnd when somebody receives the data\nthat we're sending they can run the same\n\n225\n00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,460\nalgorithm and they should get the same\nnumber, the same response that we got.\n\n226\n00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,070\nIf they match,\nthe data wasn't tampered with.\n\n227\n00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,440\nBut if the data was tampered with,\n\n228\n00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,600\nwhen they run the algorithm\nthey'll get a different response.\n\n229\n00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,470\nThey won't match and that lets them\nknow the data has been tampered with.\n\n230\n00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,630\nNow, that sounds like a lot of work.\n\n231\n00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,572\nIt is a lot of work if-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n232\n00:11:58,572 --> 00:11:59,630\n>> We were to do it ourselves.\n\n233\n00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,600\nBut your computer can do this near\ninstantly in the background, and so\n\n234\n00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,190\nwe see it in use in a lot\nof different systems\n\n235\n00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,050\nto make sure that our data\ndoesn't get tampered with.\n\n236\n00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,220\n>> Exactly.\nI can give you guys\n\n237\n00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,440\nan example of that as well.\n\n238\n00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,090\nIf we wanna flip over here to my\nscreen again, this is a simple online\n\n239\n00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:17,520\nhashing calculator, and it's got\nthe ability to drop files in here.\n\n240\n00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,678\nI'm just gonna do a simple string,\nand I'll put in something like hello,\n\n241\n00:12:21,678 --> 00:12:22,675\nif I could spell.\n\n242\n00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:23,820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hello, world.\n\n243\n00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,560\nEverybody's favorite first\nprogramming string there.\n\n244\n00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,910\nAnd I can see then below,\n\n245\n00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:34,930\nit has generated this zone as\na hash value or a message digest.\n\n246\n00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,570\nAnd if I take that same information,\nI'm gonna cut it you see it's gone.\n\n247\n00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:42,190\nAnd if I paste it back in there, I know it\nprobably difficult for us to see at this\n\n248\n00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,330\npoint, but if I copied those numbers out\nyou could see they're exactly the same.\n\n249\n00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:50,950\nBecause I'm putting the same input,\nI'm always gonna get the same output.\n\n250\n00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,370\nIf I change a single character in there.\n\n251\n00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,460\nNotice that it immediately changed\nthat hash value down there.\n\n252\n00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:02,530\nIf I take that back out, it changes\nback to the original hash value.\n\n253\n00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,800\nThat's the way these\ndigital signatures work.\n\n254\n00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,050\nIf anything changes,\nthat value is gonna change and\n\n255\n00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,320\nthat's a way that I can\ndetect that change.\n\n256\n00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,770\nAnd this isn't just about\neverything we do, right?\n\n257\n00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,580\nWhen we send the packets\nacross the network,\n\n258\n00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:19,480\nTCPIP as a check sum in there that uses\nthis system to make sure that the packet\n\n259\n00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,020\nat the other end is the same\nas the packet that was sent.\n\n260\n00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,300\nWhen you boot up your system,\n\n261\n00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,960\nit checks your system files to make\nsure that they haven't been modified.\n\n262\n00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,620\nWell it just keeps a little table.\n\n263\n00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,070\nIt's taken all your system files,\nand it's hashed them.\n\n264\n00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:36,070\nAnd it has those recorded and\nwhen it starts up it hashes them again and\n\n265\n00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,020\ncompares them.\n\n266\n00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,770\nIf they're still the same, if those values\nmatch, then I know those system files.\n\n267\n00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,410\nI don't have to go bit by\nbit by bit looking at it.\n\n268\n00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,860\nAll I have to do is\ncompare the signatures.\n\n269\n00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,730\nIf they match,\nthen that file is still the same.\n\n270\n00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,860\n>> Another way that we can provide\nthis integrity is through encryption.\n\n271\n00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,770\nNow, I know we just mentioned\nencryption in the confidentiality.\n\n272\n00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,240\nWe're gonna mention it here too?\n\n273\n00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,790\nWell if you think about it,\nif you've encrypted your data and\n\n274\n00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,834\nthe attacker can't even\nread it in the first place,\n\n275\n00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:06,040\nhw can they modify something\nthey can't even read?\n\n276\n00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,110\nSo that one kind of kills two\nbirds with one stone, right?\n\n277\n00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,000\nIt knocks them both out.\n\n278\n00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,610\n>> It really does.\n\n279\n00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,630\nIf we flip back over to,\n\n280\n00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,370\nwhere'd I have that on my spreadsheet\nhere I can see that ciphertext, right?\n\n281\n00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,820\nAnd let's say, I wanted to modify it.\n\n282\n00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,690\nWell I don't know the key to decrypt it.\n\n283\n00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,030\nSo I might be able to change it.\n\n284\n00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,630\nI could come in here and change one\nof these letters to something else.\n\n285\n00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:29,390\nGreat, I changed it but when they decrypt\nit, is it gonna make any sense or\n\n286\n00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,940\nis going to be obvious that\nit's been changed, right?\n\n287\n00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,680\nSo encryption does provide both.\n\n288\n00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,500\nIt actually gives you that confidentiality\nas well as integrity, all right.\n\n289\n00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,380\nNot foolproof integrity, but\nit definitely helps with that.\n\n290\n00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,280\n>> And that's really,\n\n291\n00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,740\nthe best solutions address more than\none area inside of the CIA triad.\n\n292\n00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,540\nSo that's how you kind of identify those.\n\n293\n00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,700\nAnd it's why encryption is so commonplace.\n\n294\n00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,080\n>> Exactly, so integrity again, making\nsure that that data is not modified either\n\n295\n00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,270\nintentionally, maliciously or\naccidentally, however we choose to use it.\n\n296\n00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,780\nAnd then the last leg of our little\ntriad here is the availability.\n\n297\n00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,172\nAnd it's funny, Don, when you first\ntalk about this people are like wait,\n\n298\n00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:10,220\nI thought we were talking about security.\n\n299\n00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,780\nHow does availability fit into security?\n\n300\n00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,610\nWell we've gotta make sure\nthe information is available.\n\n301\n00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,360\nI can have it bulletproof secure, right?\n\n302\n00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,620\nI could take that server that has\nall those databases on there.\n\n303\n00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,530\nI could take it offline.\n\n304\n00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:26,140\nI could dump it in a box or\nin a bucket and pour concrete in there.\n\n305\n00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,110\nNobody's gonna get access to that data.\n\n306\n00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,620\nIt's not gonna do me any good though,\nright?\n\n307\n00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,720\nEven the legitimate people, the people\nthat are supposed to have access\n\n308\n00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,630\nto the information are not\ngonna get it either.\n\n309\n00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,980\nSo availability has to be\na part of our security.\n\n310\n00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,490\nIf the information is available to\nwho is supposed to be available to,\n\n311\n00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,272\nit doesn't do me any good.\n\n312\n00:15:45,272 --> 00:15:49,500\n>> Yeah, now availability of the three\ntopics that we covered for the CIA triad.\n\n313\n00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,495\nAvailability is probably the biggest and\nit's also one of the most misunderstood,\n\n314\n00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,589\nbecause it's easy to think about\ncomputers and technology, but\n\n315\n00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,360\nthere's a lot of low tech\ninvolved in availability also.\n\n316\n00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,640\nAt a minimum,\nwe do need to think about our computers.\n\n317\n00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,501\nFor example, let's say on my laptop\nI've got a spreadsheet with data on it\n\n318\n00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:08,661\nthat's really important to me, right?\n\n319\n00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:12,010\nI need to make sure I've got that data.\n\n320\n00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,000\nWell, if a hacker were to break into\nmy computer and erase my hard drive,\n\n321\n00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,891\nI'd lose that data.\n\n322\n00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,671\nThat would be a big deal, right?\n\n323\n00:16:17,671 --> 00:16:19,091\nThat would really be a problem.\n\n324\n00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:21,441\nSo how do I create availability there?\n\n325\n00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:22,871\nWell, there's several options.\n\n326\n00:16:22,871 --> 00:16:25,601\nWe could prevent the hacker from getting\ninto the computer in the first place.\n\n327\n00:16:25,601 --> 00:16:27,431\nSo there's technologies for that.\n\n328\n00:16:27,431 --> 00:16:31,026\nWe can put firewalls and\nanti-virus software, things like that,\n\n329\n00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:34,050\nto help protect us from that intrusion.\n\n330\n00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,000\nOr, we could just back up my hard drive.\n\n331\n00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,035\nIf I've got a backup copy of my hard\ndrive and somebody erases my drive,\n\n332\n00:16:40,035 --> 00:16:40,801\nwell, big deal.\n\n333\n00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:43,546\nI'll just go to my backup,\nI got another copy of it right here, and\n\n334\n00:16:43,546 --> 00:16:44,241\nmy data is safe.\n\n335\n00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:47,581\nMy data is still available even\nthough my hard drive failed.\n\n336\n00:16:47,581 --> 00:16:52,095\nOr somebody broke in and stole my laptop\nor whatever, I still have my data.\n\n337\n00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:57,345\n>> Another way we provide availability\nis backing up those keys.\n\n338\n00:16:57,345 --> 00:17:01,605\nWe talked about encryption, and I can use\nthat to provide confidentiality as well as\n\n339\n00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:05,806\nintegrity, and that I needed that key to\nbe able to get that information backed up.\n\n340\n00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:08,025\nWhat if I lose that key?\n\n341\n00:17:08,025 --> 00:17:09,880\nThat key is no longer available.\n\n342\n00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,860\nSo he's doing something like key escrow or\nmaking sure that we've got a backup\n\n343\n00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,810\ncopy of those keys is also\nproviding a level of availability.\n\n344\n00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,420\n>> Now, when we talk about information\nsecurity, I know, me, in my mind,\n\n345\n00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,821\nthe first thing I think of is\ndefending from the hackers.\n\n346\n00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:26,195\nRight?\nWe gotta keep the bad guys out of\n\n347\n00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:26,721\nour network.\n\n348\n00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:31,011\nBut you're also defending from other\nthings like the forces of nature.\n\n349\n00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:31,611\nRight.\n\n350\n00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:35,551\nHurricanes, thunderstorms,\ntsunami, tidal wave, whatever.\n\n351\n00:17:35,551 --> 00:17:38,886\nAll of these are different things that\ncould come in and affect our network.\n\n352\n00:17:38,886 --> 00:17:41,136\nRight.\nTake this studio, for example.\n\n353\n00:17:41,136 --> 00:17:42,736\nSo here we are recording this show.\n\n354\n00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:47,632\nIf a hurricane came through, or a flood,\nor an earthquake and destroyed the studio,\n\n355\n00:17:47,632 --> 00:17:49,940\nwe couldn't film our show, right?\n\n356\n00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,931\nWhich means our data is no\nlonger available to the viewers.\n\n357\n00:17:52,931 --> 00:17:56,402\nSo, information security is\ngonna have to have plans for\n\n358\n00:17:56,402 --> 00:17:59,250\nwhat to do if there's an earthquake.\n\n359\n00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,030\nNow, that doesn't sound like\nan IT guy kind of thing, is it?\n\n360\n00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,030\nBut it really is, because we've got\nto make sure that our information,\n\n361\n00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:07,900\nwhat's stored in our computers,\n\n362\n00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,100\nis available even in a natural disaster or\nphysical disaster of some sort.\n\n363\n00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,208\n>> Exactly.\nAnd this is where we talk about things\n\n364\n00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:18,371\nlike disaster recovery sites or\nkeeping a copy of those backups offline.\n\n365\n00:18:18,371 --> 00:18:22,461\nAnd I got a little drawing here that I\nwhipped up real quick to show you that\n\n366\n00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:24,960\nconcept of a disaster recovery site.\n\n367\n00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,550\nI've got my corporate network down here\nin the bottom left of this drawing, and\n\n368\n00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,941\nthis is where our file servers are,\nall of our data, and things like that.\n\n369\n00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:35,521\nThat's what we access throughout\nthe business day in a normal situation.\n\n370\n00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:36,627\nBut as Don said,\n\n371\n00:18:36,627 --> 00:18:42,090\nwe've got natural disasters that can\noccur oOr human disasters as well.\n\n372\n00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:46,497\nHurricane comes through, earthquake,\nfires, bombs, what have you.\n\n373\n00:18:46,497 --> 00:18:51,134\nSomething happens to that corporate\nnetwork, well, we can still survive,\n\n374\n00:18:51,134 --> 00:18:55,699\nbecause we have made duplicates of our\ninformation over here in our disaster\n\n375\n00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:57,210\nrecovery site.\n\n376\n00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,290\nNow, we're not going to get\ninto the nuts and bolts of how.\n\n377\n00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,601\nThere's several ways I could\nprovide that redundancy.\n\n378\n00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:05,525\nBut having that other site,\nif my corporate network disappears,\n\n379\n00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:09,680\nwell, we can now connect\nto that data recovery site.\n\n380\n00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,701\nAnd that's a way that we can\nprovide that availability.\n\n381\n00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:16,089\nAnother method you might see on\nan individual server example,\n\n382\n00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,501\nlike a web server or a file server.\n\n383\n00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:21,031\nI've got to make sure that\nthat information is available.\n\n384\n00:19:21,031 --> 00:19:23,871\nIf my web server goes down,\npeople can't come buy my product.\n\n385\n00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,120\nMy company doesn't make any money.\n\n386\n00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,878\nOr if that file server goes down,\nmy employees can't get access to\n\n387\n00:19:28,878 --> 00:19:31,440\nthe information to find the customers\nthat they need to call or\n\n388\n00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,541\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n389\n00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:36,919\nSo here's an example of server cluster,\nwhere we've taken multiple\n\n390\n00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,011\nphysical servers back here and\nwe've clustered them together.\n\n391\n00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:42,640\nIn other words, basically,\n\n392\n00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,881\nwhat we're doing is creating what appears\nto the network as a single server.\n\n393\n00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:49,041\nSo when this end user or the customer or\n\n394\n00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:52,214\nwhatever connects to the file server or\nthe web server,\n\n395\n00:19:52,214 --> 00:19:56,621\nthey're not really connecting directly\nto one of these physical machines.\n\n396\n00:19:56,621 --> 00:20:01,041\nThey're connecting to here, and then\nusing some different methods that we have\n\n397\n00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:05,331\navailable, like clustering with Windows\nand things like that, that request\n\n398\n00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:10,002\ncould be sent to any one of these four\nphysical machines in the background.\n\n399\n00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:13,981\nNow, if one of these machines happens\nto go offline or disappear, it's okay.\n\n400\n00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:17,992\nWe can still access that website because\nthe requests can just be sent to one of\n\n401\n00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:19,361\nthe remaining machines.\n\n402\n00:20:19,361 --> 00:20:23,480\nSo this is another way we can\nprovide that availability.\n\n403\n00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,970\n>> Now also, our hardware vendors and\nour software vendors,\n\n404\n00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,491\nthey want to help us provide availability.\n\n405\n00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:35,092\nSo there's new attacks, new attack vectors\nthat hackers can use to break into our\n\n406\n00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:37,101\nsystems that come out all the time.\n\n407\n00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:39,621\nEvery single day,\nthere's new attacks that are discovered.\n\n408\n00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:44,508\nSo vendors like Microsoft and\nApple, Dell, Lenovo, you name it,\n\n409\n00:20:44,508 --> 00:20:49,226\nany IT company out there,\nare continually pushing out patches,\n\n410\n00:20:49,226 --> 00:20:54,320\nhot fixes, and updates to keep\nour systems running smoothly.\n\n411\n00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,190\nI know there's been some really high\nvisibility SSL attacks over the last few\n\n412\n00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,970\nmonths, and each time the web browser\nvendors and the operating system\n\n413\n00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,140\nvendors have been quick to push out\nupdates to your machines to protect you.\n\n414\n00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,961\nThat's nice because we don't\nhave to figure it out, right?\n\n415\n00:21:09,961 --> 00:21:11,990\nThe vendor takes care, of course.\n\n416\n00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,251\nBut it is our responsibility to\nperform those updates, right?\n\n417\n00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:18,943\nYou, as the viewer, you may have had that\none at one point where your computer says,\n\n418\n00:21:18,943 --> 00:21:20,295\nhey, updates are available.\n\n419\n00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:22,995\nAnd you say, I'll do it later,\nor cancel, or whatever.\n\n420\n00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:25,925\nWell, you're putting your availability\nat risk when you do that.\n\n421\n00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:29,795\nYou're are susceptible to whatever that\nexploit is until you do the update.\n\n422\n00:21:29,795 --> 00:21:31,593\nSo the sooner we do those updates,\n\n423\n00:21:31,593 --> 00:21:35,500\nthe more we guarantee that our systems\nwill be available and operational.\n\n424\n00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,561\nWe minimize that threat.\n\n425\n00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:37,361\n>> Exactly.\n\n426\n00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:41,274\nThat's one of the things that a lot of\npeople forget about is doing that general\n\n427\n00:21:41,274 --> 00:21:45,722\nmaintenance, doing those updates really is\nhelping us with our information security,\n\n428\n00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:47,641\nand it's a big part of that CIA triad.\n\n429\n00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:51,734\nAnd then we talked, we also mentioned,\nI think, before the show, we talked about\n\n430\n00:21:51,734 --> 00:21:55,726\nphysical security, Don, putting fences\naround buildings, having cameras.\n\n431\n00:21:55,726 --> 00:21:59,831\nThis is helping keep my\ninfrastructure safe as well and\n\n432\n00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:02,426\nprovide a level of availability.\n\n433\n00:22:02,426 --> 00:22:03,896\n>> You know, you mention fences.\n\n434\n00:22:03,896 --> 00:22:06,862\nThere was a story I heard a few\nyears back about a data center,\n\n435\n00:22:06,862 --> 00:22:07,976\nI was out in Colorado.\n\n436\n00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:10,436\nIt was state of the art data center,\nright?\n\n437\n00:22:10,436 --> 00:22:11,256\nMultimillion dollar.\n\n438\n00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:16,121\nThey had server racks, cooling systems,\nredundant power, redundant network.\n\n439\n00:22:16,121 --> 00:22:21,091\nThey had all sorts of just great stuff in\nthis facility to be completely redundant.\n\n440\n00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:24,401\nIf power went out, they didn't have\none set of external generators.\n\n441\n00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:26,121\nThey had four external sets of generators.\n\n442\n00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:28,890\nI mean,\nthey just had tons of infrastructure.\n\n443\n00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,000\nIt was as redundant as you could want it.\n\n444\n00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,751\nWell, somebody performed\na denial service attack.\n\n445\n00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:37,205\nNow a denial of service, that just means\nthey somehow stop your service from being\n\n446\n00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:39,621\navailable to the customers\nthrough any means possible.\n\n447\n00:22:39,621 --> 00:22:42,241\nAnd it's easy to think of\nthose movies where people do,\n\n448\n00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:44,601\nthey hack in using all\nsorts of coding craziness.\n\n449\n00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:47,220\nBut the way they did it?\n\n450\n00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,768\nThey went to the outside of the building\nto the air conditioning units, and\n\n451\n00:22:50,768 --> 00:22:53,020\nthey stuck sticks,\nlittle wooden dowel rods,\n\n452\n00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,990\ndown in the fans of the air conditioning\nunits to stop them from spinning.\n\n453\n00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:00,320\nAnd the temperature increased inside of\nthe building cuz it didn't have a way to\n\n454\n00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,920\npush heat out, and\nthe servers went into thermal shutdown.\n\n455\n00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,671\nSo, they didn't even\nhave get in the building.\n\n456\n00:23:05,671 --> 00:23:07,541\nThey didn't even have to\nknow how to hack anything.\n\n457\n00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:09,780\nThey just stuck sticks in\nthe air conditioning units.\n\n458\n00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,151\n>> It could have been\na ten-year-old doing this.\n\n459\n00:23:11,151 --> 00:23:13,621\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, and the way you prevent that?\n\n460\n00:23:13,621 --> 00:23:14,511\nYou put up a fence.\n\n461\n00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:17,131\nA fence with some razor wire or whatever.\n\n462\n00:23:17,131 --> 00:23:18,541\nNow people can't get to the AC units.\n\n463\n00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:22,060\nIt's easy to overlook physical security.\n\n464\n00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,000\nIt's not, you know,\n\n465\n00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,731\nyou don't have to have a PhD in\nComputer Science to put up a fence.\n\n466\n00:23:25,731 --> 00:23:27,991\nSo that kind of stuff is easy overlook.\n\n467\n00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:32,351\nAnd a guard that patrols a building,\nthat helps with availability.\n\n468\n00:23:32,351 --> 00:23:34,569\nRight.\nWe deter somebody trying to break in when\n\n469\n00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:36,821\nthey see somebody\npatrolling that building.\n\n470\n00:23:36,821 --> 00:23:40,741\nThese are all steps that fall\nunder information security.\n\n471\n00:23:40,741 --> 00:23:45,500\nSo don't pigeon-hole your mind into\nthinking just of computers when it\n\n472\n00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,691\ncomes to information security.\n\n473\n00:23:47,691 --> 00:23:50,601\nIt's not all about firewalls,\nand VPNs, and antivirus.\n\n474\n00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:55,216\nIt's also about more mundane\nthings like insurance policies,\n\n475\n00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:59,151\nsecurity guards, locked doors,\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n476\n00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:02,631\n>> And it's not just the security,\nthe IT people that are responsible for\n\n477\n00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:03,391\nthis, right?\n\n478\n00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:06,641\nIt's you, it's I,\nit's everybody that uses that network.\n\n479\n00:24:06,641 --> 00:24:10,581\nI've gotta make sure that I'm locking my\nscreen when I walk away from my computer.\n\n480\n00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:14,486\nI've gotta make sure that I'm not\npropping that backdoor open so\n\n481\n00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:17,621\nthat anybody could walk through and\nnot have a code.\n\n482\n00:24:17,621 --> 00:24:21,141\nSo we've got to make sure that we\nunderstand that everybody's responsible.\n\n483\n00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:23,631\nAnd that's really what\nCIA triad is all about.\n\n484\n00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:30,380\nIt's a general outline telling us what\nit means to keep our information secure.\n\n485\n00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:35,070\n>> Well, Mike, I think we've done a pretty\ngood job of running down the three\n\n486\n00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,706\nmain areas of information security.\n\n487\n00:24:36,706 --> 00:24:40,692\nSo that just to recap, we did\nconfidentiality, which is making sure that\n\n488\n00:24:40,692 --> 00:24:44,895\nour data was only visible by people\nwe intended to be visible to.\n\n489\n00:24:44,895 --> 00:24:48,856\nWe did integrity to make sure that our\ndata wasn't modified after we sent it.\n\n490\n00:24:48,856 --> 00:24:52,245\nSo, if somebody gets it,\nit is the way we intended it to be.\n\n491\n00:24:52,245 --> 00:24:53,381\nAnd then, we did availability.\n\n492\n00:24:53,381 --> 00:24:57,317\nMaking sure that our information is\navailable to the people who want to use it\n\n493\n00:24:57,317 --> 00:24:58,621\nwhen they want to use it.\n\n494\n00:24:58,621 --> 00:25:02,175\nThose are the three main things that\nwe need to provide with any kind of\n\n495\n00:25:02,175 --> 00:25:05,621\ninformation security environment,\nand they're all critical.\n\n496\n00:25:05,621 --> 00:25:07,601\nYou can't just have one and\nignore the others.\n\n497\n00:25:07,601 --> 00:25:09,021\nYou've really got to work on all three.\n\n498\n00:25:09,021 --> 00:25:09,871\n>> Exactly.\n\n499\n00:25:09,871 --> 00:25:11,703\nThink about a tripod.\nIf you've got two legs on a tripod,\n\n500\n00:25:11,703 --> 00:25:13,161\nit's not gonna stand up too well.\n\n501\n00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:14,950\n[LAUGH] Gotta have all three legs there.\n\n502\n00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,911\n>> We could have two, and like,\nlean against the wall or something.\n\n503\n00:25:17,911 --> 00:25:19,401\n[LAUGH]\n>> A couple bookshelves on one side.\n\n504\n00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:20,981\n>> All right.\n\n505\n00:25:20,981 --> 00:25:24,351\nWell, ladies and gentlemen, I think it's a\ngood spot for us to wrap up this episode.\n\n506\n00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:26,801\nI hope you guys enjoyed it,\nand be sure to stay tuned.\n\n507\n00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:28,461\nRight.\nThis is the first episode.\n\n508\n00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:30,241\nWe've got a whole series ahead of us.\n\n509\n00:25:30,241 --> 00:25:33,346\nWe're going to dive into all sorts\nof different technologies and\n\n510\n00:25:33,346 --> 00:25:36,291\ncomponents that make up a good\ninformation security policy.\n\n511\n00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:38,350\nSo, stay tuned for that.\n\n512\n00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,381\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pizet.\n\n513\n00:25:40,381 --> 00:25:41,431\n>> And I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n514\n00:25:41,431 --> 00:25:46,950\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n",
