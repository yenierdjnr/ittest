00:00:04.636\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:04.636 --> 00:00:07.998\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:07.998 --> 00:00:10.912\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPRO TV.\n\n6\n00:00:10.912 --> 00:00:13.286\n&gt;&gt; All right, greetings everyone and\n\n7\n00:00:13.286 --> 00:00:16.386\nwelcome to another great\nepisode of ITPRO TV.\n\n8\n00:00:16.386 --> 00:00:21.870\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and for\nthis episode we're having our inaugural\n\n9\n00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.880\nepisode of our Security Tech Skill course.\n\n10\n00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.720\nAnd we've been working hard to bring this\nto you because we know this is something\n\n11\n00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.120\nyou guys are really interested in,\nas am I and the person joining me.\n\n12\n00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.830\nOur good friend Mr. Mike Rodrick.\n\n13\n00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.010\nMike, how's it going man?\n\n14\n00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.330\n&gt;&gt; It's going great Daniel,\nglad to be here.\n\n15\n00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.480\nExcited as well, because it is fun stuff.\n\n16\n00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.110\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; You know it is exciting kind of stuff.\n\n17\n00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.980\nBut it's also important stuff.\n\n18\n00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.170\nIt's stuff that hopefully\nyou'll be able to use.\n\n19\n00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.770\nIf you're getting into security,\nif your job has come to you and\n\n20\n00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.320\nsay we need you to be kind of that guy and\ngal and\n\n21\n00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.010\nhelp protect our network then there's some\nbasic skills that you're going to need.\n\n22\n00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.620\nAnd that's really what we\nwant to cover in this series.\n\n23\n00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.770\nSome of the skills you should just have,\nthe basics.\n\n24\n00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.700\nWe're not talking about going out and\nwriting scripts and\n\n25\n00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.180\nthings like that just yet.\n\n26\n00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.630\nWe have courses for that,\nand that is fun as well.\n\n27\n00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.030\nBut here we want to get your feet\nwet in the world of security and\n\n28\n00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.410\nteach you some of\nthe skills that you need.\n\n29\n00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.460\nIn this inaugural episode,\n\n30\n00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.410\nwe're going to learn how to do\nsomething known as host discovery.\n\n31\n00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.550\nAnd what we really mean by that is\nwe need to go out to our network and\n\n32\n00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.735\nwe need to find out what's there.\n\n33\n00:01:27.735 --> 00:01:33.350\nAnd there's several reasons that we would\nwant to know what's on our network.\n\n34\n00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.219\nWe need to know what host we have,\nwhat clients we have on the network,\n\n35\n00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.536\nwhat servers,\nwhat access points were there.\n\n36\n00:01:41.536 --> 00:01:45.628\nAnd we need to make sure not only you're\ngonna know what should be there but\n\n37\n00:01:45.628 --> 00:01:49.380\nwe are also looking for\nthings that maybe shouldn't be there.\n\n38\n00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.955\nAll right, that strange machine\non the network, that's got and\n\n39\n00:01:52.955 --> 00:01:55.620\nIP address that's outside\nof your DHCP scope.\n\n40\n00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.080\nMay be it's in the right subnet but it's\nnot in your scope of dynamic addresses.\n\n41\n00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.720\nAnd so, what is it?\n\n42\n00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.710\nWhere did it come from?\n\n43\n00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.030\n&gt;&gt; So, Mike you are not talking about\nus walking around room to room,\n\n44\n00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.540\ntable to table with a pen and\na pad of paper going, yes, that is ours.\n\n45\n00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.170\nYes that printer is ours.\n\n46\n00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.810\nOkay who brought in the access plane.\n\n47\n00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.380\nNot that that's not a viable solution.\n\n48\n00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it is.\n\n49\n00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.570\n&gt;&gt; It can be right but we're talking\nabout using a tool to find these things.\n\n50\n00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.430\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and I like that.\n\n51\n00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.790\nI mean there is something to be said for\ndoing a physical look,\n\n52\n00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.660\nit's something that you're\ngonna have to do periodically.\n\n53\n00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.860\nWhen you're doing your wireless networks\nand you're looking for dead spots or\n\n54\n00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.120\nrogue access points, you'll probably\nwill do a little walking around then.\n\n55\n00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.150\nMaybe with your little cart,\nyour laptop and go rolling around,\n\n56\n00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.760\nwhatever you gotta do.\n\n57\n00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.830\nBut yes, here we're gonna be talking about\nkind of using the network to go out and\n\n58\n00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.940\nsee what's out there.\n\n59\n00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.822\nAnd we're gonna be using\na tool known as Nmap.\n\n60\n00:02:48.822 --> 00:02:55.400\nNow Nmap is a fantastic program, been\naround for a long time, and it does a lot.\n\n61\n00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.340\nIt's a port scanner, but\nit can also do host discovery.\n\n62\n00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.990\nIt can look at services and\nit can do OS Detection-\n\n63\n00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.938\n&gt;&gt; Makes julienne fries.\n\n64\n00:03:04.938 --> 00:03:05.456\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n65\n00:03:05.456 --> 00:03:08.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you get it set up right, and\n\n66\n00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.275\nyou gotta really tweak that config file\nto get those julienne fries just right.\n\n67\n00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:15.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Doing host discovery is very simple,\n\n68\n00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.690\nand Nmap itself is a very powerful tool,\nbut it's relatively easy to work with.\n\n69\n00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.830\nIt's got its own scripting language,\nit is extremely powerful.\n\n70\n00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.530\nBut like I said here we just want\nto kind of start off easy and\n\n71\n00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.520\nwe're going to take a look at\njust doing some host discovery.\n\n72\n00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.840\nThe other thing I like\nabout host discovery, one,\n\n73\n00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.940\nI need to know what\ndevices are on my network.\n\n74\n00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.530\nI need to see if there's any\ndevices that don't belong.\n\n75\n00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.610\nAnd the other thing I'll need to do at\nsome point is start doing port scans.\n\n76\n00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.890\nWhen we talk about hardening servers,\n\n77\n00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.540\nhardening nodes of any kind,\none of the big things we talk about is\n\n78\n00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.680\neliminating services\nthat aren't necessary.\n\n79\n00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.620\nWhich means I'm gonna be doing port scans.\n\n80\n00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.000\nWe're gonna scan those machines and\n\n81\n00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.610\nsee what ports are opening, what\nservices are in their listening state.\n\n82\n00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.700\nWhich Nmap will do as well.\n\n83\n00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.550\nBut before we can do that,\nwe need find the hosts so\n\n84\n00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.490\nthat's where we're gonna start is\nfinding those hosts out there.\n\n85\n00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.760\nAnd then we can worry about\nthe other stuff later.\n\n86\n00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.290\n&gt;&gt; So I just yell at my computer now and\nI say, okay computer.\n\n87\n00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.697\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Nmap my network finds these things for\n\n88\n00:04:12.697 --> 00:04:13.496\nme right?\n\n89\n00:04:13.496 --> 00:04:17.120\n&gt;&gt; That's coming to a theater soon but\n[LAUGH] not yet right.\n\n90\n00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.560\nMaybe if we take that echo and\nwe hook it up to the thing.\n\n91\n00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.750\n&gt;&gt; Yeah see we can make it happen.\n\n92\n00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.740\nWe have the technology.\n\n93\n00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.560\n&gt;&gt; We could do it all right so\nthere's a new project for you guys and\n\n94\n00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.650\ngirls out there.\n\n95\n00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.950\n&gt;&gt; Is a good echo to work with\nNmap to work with the scanning.\n\n96\n00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.240\nAll right but anyways now what we're gonna\ndo rather than holler we're gonna type.\n\n97\n00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.340\nSo let's take a look at my screen here\nI've got a install of Kali Linux.\n\n98\n00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.560\nOne of my favorite distros just because\nit has a lot of the tools loaded up in\n\n99\n00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.980\nthere already.\n\n100\n00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.590\nBut it's definitely you can run\nnmap on any flavor of Linux\n\n101\n00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.160\n&gt;&gt; Just have to go out to nmap.org.\n\n102\n00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.150\nGet your source files, compile it,\nor do your app get, or\n\n103\n00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.640\nI don't know, whatever you need to do for\nyour Linux distro.\n\n104\n00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.770\nIt also runs on Windows.\n\n105\n00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.080\nWe'll take a look at the Windows port,\n\n106\n00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.875\nwhich is one of those\nnot as common things.\n\n107\n00:04:58.875 --> 00:05:01.360\nWere it'll run on Linux and\nit'll run on Windows, and\n\n108\n00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.050\nit does a pretty good job on Windows.\n\n109\n00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.660\nA lot of times the Windows port\nof a Linux tool is Subpar.\n\n110\n00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.270\nBut not so with Nmap.\n\n111\n00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.550\nWe even get a gooey with Windows.\n\n112\n00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.502\nAnd some of you out\nthere might be like yes,\n\n113\n00:05:14.502 --> 00:05:16.520\nI'll just fast forward\nuntil I get to that.\n\n114\n00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.790\n&gt;&gt; Where's the graphical\nversion of that thing man?\n\n115\n00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.360\n&gt;&gt; All right, so I'm sorry.\n\n116\n00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.490\nTaylor's got my screen pulled up and\nI just keep talking.\n\n117\n00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.190\nLet's do some stuff here.\n\n118\n00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.140\nSo anyway Nmap,\nI'm just gonna type Nmap and hit enter.\n\n119\n00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.780\nYou can do an dash h or an dash dash\nhelp and you can get this same file.\n\n120\n00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.970\nLet's take a look at it here.\n\n121\n00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.430\nScroll back up to the top and\n\n122\n00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:41.340\nyou can see some relatively extensive help\navailable right here from the command.\n\n123\n00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.760\nYou can always go out to nmap.org.\n\n124\n00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.270\nWe'll take a peek at their\nwebsite in a minute, and\n\n125\n00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.360\nthey've got their documentation out there,\nand it's very extensive.\n\n126\n00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.700\nBut we're going to be focusing\nin on host discovery here.\n\n127\n00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.660\nAnd we'll be doing a ping scan,\nwhich is gonna disable my port scan.\n\n128\n00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.240\nBecause at this point I don't wanna\nspend time scanning ports yet,\n\n129\n00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.190\nbecause I don't know\nwhat hosts are out there.\n\n130\n00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.820\nA port scan, depending on how\nwe set it up, scans ports and\n\n131\n00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.080\nit could scan all 65,535 of those guys.\n\n132\n00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.330\nLooking for services that are opening, and\n\n133\n00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:22.290\nwhat I don't wanna do let's say\nwhat's your average number class\n\n134\n00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.940\nC maybe even a class B if we're\ntrying to use the classful system?\n\n135\n00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.020\n254 hosts.\n\n136\n00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.520\nWe get to a class B.\n\n137\n00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.249\nWhat is that, Daniel?\n\n138\n00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:32.780\n16,777,000, something like that?\n\n139\n00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.640\n&gt;&gt; That's a lot.\n\n140\n00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.700\nYeah, that's a lot.\n\n141\n00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.188\n&gt;&gt; And doing a port scan on\n65,000 ports on 16 million hosts,\n\n142\n00:06:40.188 --> 00:06:43.230\nthat's not going to be a good thing.\n\n143\n00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.080\nSo we definitely want to\nfirst get live IP addresses.\n\n144\n00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.080\nBecause even in a class C,\n\n145\n00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.870\nwhat are the odds that you are using\nall of those IP addresses.\n\n146\n00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.723\nIt is doubtful that all 254 IP\naddresses are up and listening,\n\n147\n00:06:55.723 --> 00:06:56.992\nbeing used by a host.\n\n148\n00:06:56.992 --> 00:07:00.854\nBecause then you have no room left and\nyou are going to need a bigger subnet.\n\n149\n00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:04.139\nSo the first thing I would love to do\nis just get a list of live hosts that I\n\n150\n00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:05.785\ncan then take on to do my port scan.\n\n151\n00:07:05.785 --> 00:07:13.480\nSo the SN, that's switch SN\nis going to do my ping scan.\n\n152\n00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.990\nNow Daniel do you remember\nthe old command for that?\n\n153\n00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.021\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I think it was S capital P.\n\n154\n00:07:17.021 --> 00:07:19.865\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; The dash S,\n\n155\n00:07:19.865 --> 00:07:24.180\ncapital P is no longer\ndoing the ping scan.\n\n156\n00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.080\n&gt;&gt; It still works I think.\n\n157\n00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.710\nI think you can still actually use it.\n\n158\n00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.100\nSo if you'd played around with Nmap\nbefore and you're used to that,\n\n159\n00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.410\nit'll probably still work.\n\n160\n00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.100\nJust start getting used to the SN\nbecause that will eventually go away.\n\n161\n00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.970\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n162\n00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.930\nMy guess is I don't know for\nsure that Capital P,\n\n163\n00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.370\nit'll start doing\nsomething else within Nmap.\n\n164\n00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:41.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, could be.\n\n165\n00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.620\n&gt;&gt; Start running low on letters, and so.\n\n166\n00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.503\n&gt;&gt; Boy, that'd be confusing if you were\nsuper locked into SP as your ping scan,\n\n167\n00:07:47.503 --> 00:07:49.070\nand then they change it on you.\n\n168\n00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.725\nWhat are you doing?\n\n169\n00:07:49.725 --> 00:07:54.173\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, so update your\nscripts to reflect that new command.\n\n170\n00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:56.246\nSo that's the one we're gonna be doing.\n\n171\n00:07:56.246 --> 00:07:58.955\nSo let me clear out my screen here.\n\n172\n00:07:58.955 --> 00:08:03.133\nSo it's gonna be an end map and actually\nyou know what I'm gonna do for us Daniel,\n\n173\n00:08:03.133 --> 00:08:07.437\nI'm gonna connect to a different network\nreal quick that has a little more activity\n\n174\n00:08:07.437 --> 00:08:08.220\ngoing on.\n\n175\n00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.390\nI already got it switched over.\n\n176\n00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:10.430\nWe are good to go there.\n\n177\n00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:11.960\n&gt;&gt; You're being all prepared for show.\n\n178\n00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:17.143\n&gt;&gt; I know.\nLet's double check our Sometimes\n\n179\n00:08:17.143 --> 00:08:18.460\nonce in a while.\n\n180\n00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:23.380\nNow you'll notice that I'm actually\non a class b if you will right?\n\n181\n00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.310\nIt's a 25525500.\n\n182\n00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.730\nI'm not going to scan all of those hosts.\n\n183\n00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:34.810\nIt would just take even just doing\na discovery would take a long time so\n\n184\n00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:38.400\nwe're gonna trim it up a little bit,\nbut my command is going to be nmap.\n\n185\n00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.120\nSo that's the name of the tool\nthat we're gonna use and\n\n186\n00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.960\nI want to do a -sn,\nwhich is gonna be my ping sweep.\n\n187\n00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.710\nAll right.\n\n188\n00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.105\nAnd you can see in my notes I\ndid the old school there -s.\n\n189\n00:08:50.105 --> 00:08:51.000\nWe'll change that up.\n\n190\n00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.145\nWe'll make the modern command here and\nthen the network address I want to scan\n\n191\n00:08:55.145 --> 00:09:01.778\n10.0.14.0/24.\n\n192\n00:09:01.778 --> 00:09:04.950\nWe'll just do\n&gt;&gt; 16.\n\n193\n00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:05.730\n&gt;&gt; What's that?\n\n194\n00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.077\n&gt;&gt; Your netmask is 16.\n\n195\n00:09:07.077 --> 00:09:08.041\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n196\n00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:09.760\nthat does bring up a very good point.\n\n197\n00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.310\nYou don't have to use the net mask\nthat you happen to be on, right.\n\n198\n00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.115\nAs Daniel pointed out,\nI'm on a 255.255.0.0 network but\n\n199\n00:09:16.115 --> 00:09:17.455\nI don't want to scan all of that.\n\n200\n00:09:17.455 --> 00:09:20.440\n&gt;&gt; Right, change it up a little bit.\n\n201\n00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.052\n&gt;&gt; Maybe I've got [CROSSTALK], yeah,\n\n202\n00:09:22.052 --> 00:09:24.530\nmaybe I've got to break it up\nto make it take less time.\n\n203\n00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:29.151\nI've only got time to do a certain amount\nright now or maybe I just wanna scan my\n\n204\n00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:34.060\nserver backbone, maybe that's what I\npicked here as a small portion of it.\n\n205\n00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.820\nI know all the servers have an IP\naddress 10.0.14 something and so\n\n206\n00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.760\nI can cheat, if you will, by just\nsaying hey keep 10.0.14 the same right,\n\n207\n00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.810\nthat's what you're doing\nwith that next mask.\n\n208\n00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.230\nJust scan this particular network.\n\n209\n00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.340\nSo now I’m only down to\n254 possible hosts there,\n\n210\n00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.450\nso it should be a lot quicker, all right?\n\n211\n00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:56.660\nAnd I’ll go ahead and hit Enter and\nwe’ll let this guy run for\n\n212\n00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.300\na minute and there you can see,\n256 IP addresses.\n\n213\n00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.360\nRemember, there’s 254 possible hosts,\nbut there are 256\n\n214\n00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:09.190\ntotal IP addresses if you\ninclude the 0 and the 255.\n\n215\n00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.640\nScan 55 hosts took 2.3 seconds.\n\n216\n00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.290\nAs we go through these results,\n\n217\n00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:18.270\nI know they're not real easy to\nread because it's very packed.\n\n218\n00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.790\nI'm going to show you a way we\ncan break this up in a minute but\n\n219\n00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:23.870\nwe'll go back up to the top here.\n\n220\n00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.650\nThere was my initial command.\n\n221\n00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.252\nIt says starting nmap and\nthen I can see the first one.\n\n222\n00:10:31.252 --> 00:10:34.800\nNmap scan for report 0.14.11.\n\n223\n00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:42.340\nHost is up and it gives me the MAC address\nand it tells me it thinks it's an Apple.\n\n224\n00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.410\n&gt;&gt; It's probably a good guess,\nsince we run a lot of Macs here.\n\n225\n00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.631\n&gt;&gt; We do run a lot of Macs here but\nit's kinda cool that it's giving me\n\n226\n00:10:47.631 --> 00:10:50.574\na little bit of a guess there,\neven just doing a ping sweep.\n\n227\n00:10:50.574 --> 00:10:53.648\nNow in this case,\nit's not doing a lot of interrogation.\n\n228\n00:10:53.648 --> 00:10:54.544\nAll right.\n\n229\n00:10:54.544 --> 00:11:00.200\nI'll talk about doing an OS fingerprinting\nhere when we get into our port scanning.\n\n230\n00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.800\nWhat it's doing right here\nis it's looking at that,\n\n231\n00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.680\nand gosh this would be a West question\nbecause that actually has a name.\n\n232\n00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.920\nThe MAC address, the first six\ndigits are the organizational ID.\n\n233\n00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the organizational OUI or\nunit identifier or something like that?\n\n234\n00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.040\n&gt;&gt; Yes, something like that.\n\n235\n00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:19.960\nWe should watch his show.\n\n236\n00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.600\n&gt;&gt; Westnotes.\n\n237\n00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.660\nHe actually said it today, after.\n\n238\n00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.613\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But that first part,\n\n239\n00:11:24.613 --> 00:11:26.980\nthat's a block that gets assigned\nto a particular vendor, right?\n\n240\n00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:31.580\nAnd they can use the last six digits for\ntheir different devices or what have you.\n\n241\n00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.330\n&gt;&gt; Organizational unique identifier.\n\n242\n00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.820\n&gt;&gt; OUI.\n&gt;&gt; That's it, how my brain works.\n\n243\n00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.920\n&gt;&gt; You rock.\nAnd that's really what it's doing here.\n\n244\n00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.130\nIt knows that hey,\nthis has been assigned to Apple and\n\n245\n00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.390\nI think I've frozen up my machine.\n\n246\n00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.880\nThere it goes.\n\n247\n00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.010\nThis one evidently belongs\nto Hewlett Packard.\n\n248\n00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.910\nSo that's really all it's looking at.\n\n249\n00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:55.700\nIt's just a guess and\nif something was being spoofed or forged,\n\n250\n00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.830\nit would fake this out.\n\n251\n00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:00.020\nSo don't take that-\n&gt;&gt; As the gospel of Paul [LAUGH].\n\n252\n00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.080\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you know, look okay,\nthat's interesting,\n\n253\n00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.060\nit probably is an apple if all I have\nare legitimate devices on my network but\n\n254\n00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.450\nagain, don't take it for being truthful.\n\n255\n00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:13.830\nAnd you can see it's gone down through but\nI guess the point here that I would like\n\n256\n00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:20.170\nto make is the fact that I\nonly have 55 hosts up, right?\n\n257\n00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:23.040\nOut of 256, so I do my math real quick.\n\n258\n00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.680\nThat's 201.\n\n259\n00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.070\nRight, that aren't being used.\n\n260\n00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:26.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n261\n00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:31.960\n&gt;&gt; So now, if I was doing a port scan, and\nI was scanning all 65,000 some odd ports,\n\n262\n00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:37.900\nI'd be scanning 201 IP addresses\nthat weren't even there, right.\n\n263\n00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.600\nSo a complete waste of time.\n\n264\n00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the good news is that\npeople at Nmap, they know this.\n\n265\n00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.570\nThis kind of thing happens and\nthe default setting of nmap is to,\n\n266\n00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:52.290\nif it replies to a ping's response, then\nyes it's alive and go ahead and scan it.\n\n267\n00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:56.550\nIf it doesn't, then move on to the next\nguy but it still has to check and\n\n268\n00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:57.190\nsee if it's still alive.\n\n269\n00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:58.940\nIf you've already done this work,\n\n270\n00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:03.290\nyou save the scanning portion of your\nproceedings a lot of time and effort.\n\n271\n00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:04.340\n&gt;&gt; Exactly right, Daniel.\n\n272\n00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.960\nIt does do a basically a phase process.\n\n273\n00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.940\nEnd map does a discovery phase and\nthen a scanning phase and\n\n274\n00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:12.500\nwe will definitely get into\nthat when we get into scanning\n\n275\n00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.740\ncuz there are times when I\ndon't want it to do that.\n\n276\n00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:19.000\nI wanna scan because we do have to worry\nabout what if something was blocking.\n\n277\n00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.390\nLike if it's not responding to pings,\nis it going to reply to this?\n\n278\n00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.290\nRight.\nWhat if there's a firewall between me and\n\n279\n00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.770\nthe destination that's blocking\nthat particular type of traffic?\n\n280\n00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:33.330\nOr there's a firewall in the host\nthat's blocking the ping package,\n\n281\n00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.400\nwhich a lot of hosts do, right?\n\n282\n00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.050\nA lot of Windows by default will\nstart blocking those pings.\n\n283\n00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.920\nSo when it does this ping sweep,\nwhat it's really doing.\n\n284\n00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.180\nIs it's doing an ICMP ping and\n\n285\n00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:49.870\nit's also sending a TCPIP packet to\nport 80 by default which you can change.\n\n286\n00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:53.690\nSo it's doing two discovery methods there,\nsending an ICMP and\n\n287\n00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:57.890\nit's doing a TCP send request and\nif it's a send,\n\n288\n00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:02.940\nno it's an acknowledgment, it's either\na send or an ak packet that it sends.\n\n289\n00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.910\nAnd it sends it to port 80 by default,\nwhich you can change as well and\n\n290\n00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:11.680\nwhat it's saying is hey if it\nsends me back a reset or close,\n\n291\n00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.940\nwell it's not running a web server but hey\nI know it's up because it responded to me.\n\n292\n00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.510\nIf it sends back an open,\n\n293\n00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.310\nI've got a web server running then\nhey I know it's up and running.\n\n294\n00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.700\nIf it doesn't send anything back,\nthen it's probably not a live host.\n\n295\n00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:30.350\nSo it does do a double check there for\nthese live hosts, all right?\n\n296\n00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:32.100\nNow, the next thing I wanna show you here,\nand\n\n297\n00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:35.990\nthis will kinda help prepare us for\nour scanning phases, and\n\n298\n00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:38.880\nthis is good information but it's just\nsitting here on my screen, right?\n\n299\n00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.540\nIt output it to my screen and\nit's not all that useful to me here.\n\n300\n00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.910\nSo we need to know the output command for\nn map and\n\n301\n00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:52.760\nthat is going to be a -O and then there's\nseveral different formats we can use.\n\n302\n00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.550\nLet's pop that open real quick and\nI'll show you,\n\n303\n00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:01.130\ncuz we can do a few different formats and\nI'll bump that up one.\n\n304\n00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.010\nGet back right here is my output.\n\n305\n00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:09.150\nAll right, so\nwe can do the on which is normal output,\n\n306\n00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:12.110\nlooks just like this nmap output\nyou're seeing on my screen.\n\n307\n00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:14.980\nWe can do an ox which is gonna be XML.\n\n308\n00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:20.280\nWe can do a script kiddie, although I'm\nhaving trouble getting that one actually\n\n309\n00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.730\nshow any results but\nits not like it would be used.\n\n310\n00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.410\nNot that I would find it useful I guess,\nsomebody might out there.\n\n311\n00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.020\nI thought it would be cool,\nand it didn't work or\n\n312\n00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:33.150\ndash G, which is gripable, all right?\n\n313\n00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.560\nOr you can do an o dash a which is all.\n\n314\n00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.150\nIt does the three major formats at once.\n\n315\n00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:40.932\nIt would skip the script kiddie.\n\n316\n00:15:40.932 --> 00:15:42.769\nIt would do normal XML.\n\n317\n00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:47.693\nYou just give it a filename and\nit would do it in all three formats.\n\n318\n00:15:47.693 --> 00:15:52.718\nAll right, so let's close that\nwindow because that's confusing.\n\n319\n00:15:52.718 --> 00:15:57.432\nSo I'm going to to an O and I'm going to\ndo a G Right, because I like the gripable\n\n320\n00:15:57.432 --> 00:16:01.750\nbe format cuz now I can manipulate\nthat data a little bit easier.\n\n321\n00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.317\nSo I'm gonna do an -oG, and\n\n322\n00:16:03.317 --> 00:16:08.440\nI'm just gonna dump it in my current\nhome directory for simplicity's sake.\n\n323\n00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:13.234\nAnd I'm gonna say this is a nmapPingSweep,\n\n324\n00:16:13.234 --> 00:16:16.999\nand we'll go ahead and hit enter.\n\n325\n00:16:16.999 --> 00:16:21.440\nWe'll let it run one more time should take\nit about three seconds and there we go.\n\n326\n00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.780\nSo now we take a look at my directory\nthere I've got my nmapPingSweep.\n\n327\n00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:31.460\nAnd if I cat nmapPingSweep,\nI spell that right?\n\n328\n00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.250\nOne more character for my tab auto there.\n\n329\n00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.460\nAnd there is the output.\n\n330\n00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:41.400\nSo you can see same information all 55\nhosts that it found are gonna be there.\n\n331\n00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:46.430\nBut now it's on one line and I've got\nsome delimiters in here which are gonna\n\n332\n00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:51.590\nhelp me break this up into what I want,\nall right?\n\n333\n00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:58.640\nAnd the idea here is that when I do a port\nscan, I want to just scan the live hosts.\n\n334\n00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.140\nSo as Daniel said,\nby default that's what it does.\n\n335\n00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.860\nBut there might be times when you've got,\n\n336\n00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.770\njust a certain subset of your machines\nthat you want to do a port scan on.\n\n337\n00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:11.350\nLike all ten of my web servers or my three\nSQL servers, or something like that.\n\n338\n00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:15.340\nAnd a cool thing about nmap is you\ncan use lists as the source for\n\n339\n00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:17.900\nyour IPs rather than\nspecifying in the command.\n\n340\n00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.956\nLike, I want to scan that particular\nnetwork like we just did.\n\n341\n00:17:20.956 --> 00:17:22.906\nI can actually do a list, and\n\n342\n00:17:22.906 --> 00:17:28.100\nI can have it read the list and\npull the IP addresses from the list.\n\n343\n00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:30.382\nSo if we add new web servers,\nI can just add them to my list.\n\n344\n00:17:30.382 --> 00:17:34.200\nAnd then next time I run a scan, it\nwill scan those new two servers as well.\n\n345\n00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.640\nSo let me show you a quick\nway to do that here.\n\n346\n00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.850\nI'm gonna pull back that same command,\nwe're gonna run nmap.\n\n347\n00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:43.430\nActually, you know what,\nI'll just cat that.\n\n348\n00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:46.010\nLet me get back out of there.\n\n349\n00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.250\nHere's what we'll do,\nlet me clear my screen.\n\n350\n00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.850\nGet rid of caps lock, cuz that helps.\n\n351\n00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.670\nAnd I'm going to do,\nI'm gonna pull that file up.\n\n352\n00:17:54.670 --> 00:18:02.435\nI'm gonna cat that file and I'm gonna pipe\nthat out into a grep command, all right?\n\n353\n00:18:02.435 --> 00:18:06.780\nNow we saw that the, I wanna see if\nI can show you this at the same time.\n\n354\n00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.753\nI'm gonna do this.\n\n355\n00:18:10.848 --> 00:18:12.390\nAll right, so there's my file.\n\n356\n00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:20.144\nAnd over here in this other window\nwe're gonna write our command.\n\n357\n00:18:20.144 --> 00:18:24.660\nAll right, we'll do it this way.\n\n358\n00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:30.556\nSo we're gonna CAT my nmapPingSweep.\n\n359\n00:18:30.556 --> 00:18:33.981\nAnd I'm gonna pipe that\nout into my grep command,\n\n360\n00:18:33.981 --> 00:18:39.500\nand grep lets me break up that text or\ngrab certain portions of that file.\n\n361\n00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:46.461\nAnd we're gonna use the cut parameter and\nwe're gonna grep for up.\n\n362\n00:18:46.461 --> 00:18:49.220\nSo in this case I probably don't need it.\n\n363\n00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.340\nLet's see what it did,\nI believe maybe up at the top.\n\n364\n00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:55.420\nThere are two lines up at the top here\nthat is basically showing the command\n\n365\n00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.490\nthat I issued.\n\n366\n00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:00.780\nAnd those two don't have IP addresses on\nthem, and I don't want those two lines.\n\n367\n00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.093\nSo by grepping for the word up,\nI guarantee that I'm only gonna get\n\n368\n00:19:04.093 --> 00:19:07.160\nthese lines down here that\nhave live hosts on them.\n\n369\n00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.220\nSo we grep for the word up, and\nthen I'm gonna use the cut command.\n\n370\n00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:15.438\nAnd my delimiter, so\na switch D is actually gonna be a space.\n\n371\n00:19:15.438 --> 00:19:18.290\nSo I got a quote space quote there.\n\n372\n00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.560\nAnd then we're going to pick\n\n373\n00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.860\nfield number two because\nwhen we look at my results,\n\n374\n00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:33.520\nthere's the first field,\nthere's my first delimiter.\n\n375\n00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.530\nThere's my second field,\nthat's the one I want.\n\n376\n00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:41.550\nAnd you can do multiple fields, you can\ndo f2 comma 3 comma 4, or f2 comma 7.\n\n377\n00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.910\nWhatever columns you needed there,\nI'm just gonna do field two.\n\n378\n00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:50.706\nAnd then I'm gonna send that output to,\n\n379\n00:19:50.706 --> 00:19:54.630\nlet's call it liveHosts.\n\n380\n00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.393\nAll right, and I'll go ahead and run that.\n\n381\n00:19:57.393 --> 00:20:03.457\nAnd now if we cat liveHosts, we'll see\nthat I have a file that is nothing but\n\n382\n00:20:03.457 --> 00:20:06.160\nlive IP addresses on my network.\n\n383\n00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.880\n&gt;&gt; It's a beautiful list of nothing but\nIPs, Mike.\n\n384\n00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.953\nThe important part here that you should\ntake away is it's neat to be able to\n\n385\n00:20:12.953 --> 00:20:13.544\nuse cut and\n\n386\n00:20:13.544 --> 00:20:17.894\nthings like that to make the output a\nlittle more easily digested by your eyes.\n\n387\n00:20:17.894 --> 00:20:20.080\nYou're a person, right,\nthat does work for us.\n\n388\n00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.049\nBut now we really have something\nthat we could probably go on and\n\n389\n00:20:23.049 --> 00:20:24.625\nuse in sorta scripting fashion.\n\n390\n00:20:24.625 --> 00:20:28.209\nThis is a great set up point for\nus to have this file at the ready, and\n\n391\n00:20:28.209 --> 00:20:30.070\nuse it later on down the line.\n\n392\n00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.240\nSo very cool technique.\n\n393\n00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly,\nthat'll come in handy really soon.\n\n394\n00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:38.360\nAll right, next thing I wanna do, I wanna\ntake a look at the Windows side of things.\n\n395\n00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.379\nBecause as a network admin,\nyou might be sitting a windows box and\n\n396\n00:20:42.379 --> 00:20:44.728\nyou don't have access, well you do.\n\n397\n00:20:44.728 --> 00:20:47.250\n[LAUGH] But maybe you can't for\nsome reason, right.\n\n398\n00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:51.581\nWhat l will recommend is that\nyou go get Virtual Box or\n\n399\n00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:55.526\nsome other freebie\nvirtualization software.\n\n400\n00:20:55.526 --> 00:20:58.394\nAnd then download and\nset up a VM that running analytics,\n\n401\n00:20:58.394 --> 00:21:00.186\nif you wanna get into the security,\n\n402\n00:21:00.186 --> 00:21:03.740\nreally where most of the tools are gonna\nbe on the Linux side of things.\n\n403\n00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:09.540\nOr run it off of a live disk or\na USB or something like that.\n\n404\n00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:14.100\nBut let's take a look at Windows so we\ncan see that we can do it there as well.\n\n405\n00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.620\nSo again, went out to nmap.org.\n\n406\n00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.160\nI never showed you their website.\n\n407\n00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:26.520\nLet's pull that up real quick as well,\nnmap.org is the name of that site.\n\n408\n00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.110\nAnd I'm not gonna spend any time here,\nbut they've got great documentation.\n\n409\n00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.800\nThe links are right over\nhere down the side.\n\n410\n00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.690\nThey also have their download link.\n\n411\n00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:36.058\nAnd if we take a look there,\n\n412\n00:21:36.058 --> 00:21:39.785\nwe can see that they have source code\ndistribution if you want it that way.\n\n413\n00:21:39.785 --> 00:21:43.662\nYou've got your Windows binaries,\nyou've got an actual executable, right?\n\n414\n00:21:43.662 --> 00:21:46.450\nSo you don't have to know to compile and\nput things together.\n\n415\n00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:48.141\nYou can just run that if you want.\n\n416\n00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:52.890\nThey've got that all zipped up for\nyou there are well as their Linux, Mac.\n\n417\n00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:56.640\nAnd even runs on a few other\noperating systems as well.\n\n418\n00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.070\nSo go check out in map.org if\nnothing else to get nmap and\n\n419\n00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.940\nthen look at the documentation.\n\n420\n00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.460\nAll right, so\nback over to Windows, I set nmap.\n\n421\n00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:09.518\nI've installed nmap on here, but there\nis a, and if I go to a command prompt,\n\n422\n00:22:09.518 --> 00:22:10.652\nlet me do that first.\n\n423\n00:22:10.652 --> 00:22:13.360\nPull up command prompt and I type in nmap.\n\n424\n00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.190\nWe'll see that same set\nof help right there.\n\n425\n00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:17.705\n&gt;&gt; Feeling good,\nthis is very familiar to me.\n\n426\n00:22:17.705 --> 00:22:20.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes, right, it's like it works,\n\n427\n00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.740\nand it's exactly the same.\n\n428\n00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:27.399\nThere is no hey, on Windows, it's a dash\ns blah blah blah instead of a dash sn.\n\n429\n00:22:27.399 --> 00:22:32.655\nIt's exactly the same, there are no\ndifferences as far as functionality goes,\n\n430\n00:22:32.655 --> 00:22:35.770\nswitches, or\nanything like that, all right?\n\n431\n00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:39.711\nBut I want to show you Zenmap, all right?\n\n432\n00:22:39.711 --> 00:22:45.140\nZenmap Is the GUI front-end for nmap.\n\n433\n00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.026\n&gt;&gt; Get it away.\n\n434\n00:22:46.026 --> 00:22:47.286\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know, and\n\n435\n00:22:47.286 --> 00:22:51.563\na lot of you security guys\nare guys out there going, my gosh,\n\n436\n00:22:51.563 --> 00:22:54.330\nis he actually using a GUI, and yes I am.\n\n437\n00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:58.154\nAnd I'll be honest with you,\nit's a lot faster from the command line,\n\n438\n00:22:58.154 --> 00:23:00.590\nespecially once you get\nyour commands down.\n\n439\n00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:02.290\nIt's a lot easier to do.\n\n440\n00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:07.680\nBut if you're new to doing this kind of\nthing, this is a great place to start.\n\n441\n00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.690\nOne because it's a GUI.\n\n442\n00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:12.430\nSo we're familiar with that,\nwe're comfortable with a graphical user\n\n443\n00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:15.180\ninterface where I can click on things and\ntype in fields.\n\n444\n00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.920\nSo we can get rid of the learning\ncurve about the command line.\n\n445\n00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.040\nAt least at first,\nyou're gonna have to get there eventually.\n\n446\n00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.890\nBut two, the other reason I love this\n\n447\n00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:27.450\nis because you can see the command\nthat it's going to execute.\n\n448\n00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.350\nSo as you fill in your information and\n\n449\n00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:33.320\nmake your choices, you can actually start\nto learn some of your nmap commands.\n\n450\n00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.300\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Mike, it's a little tiny though,\n\n451\n00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.460\ndo you think you can make that a little\nbigger for our viewing audience out there?\n\n452\n00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.846\n&gt;&gt; Let's see if I can work my magic cuz\nI can't see it either to be honest.\n\n453\n00:23:42.846 --> 00:23:43.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's really small.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n454\n00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:46.001\nwe'll zoom in up here and\nhow's that, a little better?\n\n455\n00:23:46.001 --> 00:23:49.527\nAll right, so good old Zenmap\nwants to know what my target is.\n\n456\n00:23:49.527 --> 00:23:52.402\nAll right, so let's pick a target.\n\n457\n00:23:52.402 --> 00:23:55.940\nI've got another host\nwe're gonna hit here.\n\n458\n00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:00.486\nActually we get to do that same network,\nit didn't take that long.\n\n459\n00:24:00.486 --> 00:24:02.948\nLet's do 10.0.14.\n\n460\n00:24:02.948 --> 00:24:04.811\nIn fact, there she is in my list.\n\n461\n00:24:04.811 --> 00:24:10.879\nAnd my tab autofill didn't like that.\n\n462\n00:24:10.879 --> 00:24:14.073\nLet's add a 0/24, good old GUIs.\n\n463\n00:24:14.073 --> 00:24:15.277\nGotta click, gotta use that mouse.\n\n464\n00:24:15.277 --> 00:24:16.144\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like\n\n465\n00:24:16.144 --> 00:24:16.728\nthey're forcing you to.\n\n466\n00:24:16.728 --> 00:24:17.788\n&gt;&gt; Like get off of that keyboard, boy!\n\n467\n00:24:17.788 --> 00:24:22.600\n&gt;&gt; But do you see what's\nhappening underneath, right here?\n\n468\n00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.730\nThat's the command that\nit's going to execute.\n\n469\n00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:30.545\nSo if I change this, 15.,\nnotice how it's changing here, as well?\n\n470\n00:24:30.545 --> 00:24:32.926\nSo this will help you learn.\n\n471\n00:24:32.926 --> 00:24:39.770\nYou can come in here and do, okay, I know\nwhat I want, /24, and it adds this 4.\n\n472\n00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.946\nIt builds that command for you.\n\n473\n00:24:41.946 --> 00:24:43.727\nNow it's got a couple of other\nthings in there by default.\n\n474\n00:24:43.727 --> 00:24:47.010\nIt's got a -T4, that's for timing.\n\n475\n00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:48.242\nThat'll make it go faster.\n\n476\n00:24:48.242 --> 00:24:49.935\nIt's not as stealthy, but\n\n477\n00:24:49.935 --> 00:24:54.420\nit won't pause as long between\npackets that it's sending out.\n\n478\n00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:55.285\nThe -A, and\n\n479\n00:24:55.285 --> 00:25:00.019\nwe'll talk all about this again when\nwe get into actual port scanning.\n\n480\n00:25:00.019 --> 00:25:01.226\n-A includes versioning and OS detection.\n\n481\n00:25:01.226 --> 00:25:03.177\n-v for verbose.\n\n482\n00:25:03.177 --> 00:25:08.404\nI'm gonna take those out,\nbecause I don't want them at this point.\n\n483\n00:25:08.404 --> 00:25:12.193\nI just wanna show you\nsimple host discovery.\n\n484\n00:25:12.193 --> 00:25:12.816\nLet me back out.\n\n485\n00:25:12.816 --> 00:25:17.497\nThere are some profiles over here that\nI can choose from, all right, and\n\n486\n00:25:17.497 --> 00:25:20.270\nthese are just pre-built commands.\n\n487\n00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:21.865\nSo maybe I'm again, learning.\n\n488\n00:25:21.865 --> 00:25:24.840\nI know I wanna do a ping scan, so\nI am just gonna grab that one.\n\n489\n00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.163\nAnd let's see what it did.\n\n490\n00:25:27.163 --> 00:25:33.019\nNotice it added the -sn just\nlike we did in Linux, right?\n\n491\n00:25:33.019 --> 00:25:40.110\nSo if I zoom back out, and I go ahead and\nclick Scan, it should start that scan.\n\n492\n00:25:43.435 --> 00:25:44.270\nWhere is my window?\n\n493\n00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:44.820\nThere we go.\n\n494\n00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:45.586\nDid I say scan?\n\n495\n00:25:45.586 --> 00:25:46.321\nThere we go.\n\n496\n00:25:46.321 --> 00:25:50.776\nIt needed to be clicked twice,\nyou know how these GUIs are.\n\n497\n00:25:50.776 --> 00:25:54.708\n[LAUGH] All right, so it's starting Nmap\nand I'll zoom in as it's rolling here.\n\n498\n00:25:54.708 --> 00:25:58.900\nAnd same type of results,\nnmap scan, Host is up.\n\n499\n00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.400\nSo that's all it's doing is\nit's showing me my live host.\n\n500\n00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.960\nThat is pretty.\n\n501\n00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.676\nI've got this nice area over here.\n\n502\n00:26:04.676 --> 00:26:06.990\nLet me see if I can make\nthat a little bit wider.\n\n503\n00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:10.062\n&gt;&gt; I just like how the output area\nis very similar to what we see in\n\n504\n00:26:10.062 --> 00:26:11.398\na terminal environment.\n\n505\n00:26:11.398 --> 00:26:12.626\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; Keeps that level\n\n506\n00:26:12.626 --> 00:26:13.952\nof comfortability for us.\n\n507\n00:26:13.952 --> 00:26:17.680\n&gt;&gt; It does, and\nit has some neat things in here.\n\n508\n00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.875\nOnce we start doing actual port scans,\nwe'll see a nice list of ports.\n\n509\n00:26:22.875 --> 00:26:27.110\nLook, as I click on these individual\nhosts, it could show me the information.\n\n510\n00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:34.199\nIt'll actually print out or\ncreate a topology, which is crazy, crazy.\n\n511\n00:26:34.199 --> 00:26:35.279\nIt's tricky to get.\n\n512\n00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:38.023\nMy zoom level is way up here.\n\n513\n00:26:38.023 --> 00:26:39.552\nWhere is my zoom?\n\n514\n00:26:39.552 --> 00:26:45.852\nYeah, we're not gonna\nmess with that right now.\n\n515\n00:26:45.852 --> 00:26:47.674\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Before I do, there's my controls and\n\n516\n00:26:47.674 --> 00:26:48.332\nthere's my zoom.\n\n517\n00:26:48.332 --> 00:26:52.712\nYeah, you can start zooming in and\ncan start creating topologies.\n\n518\n00:26:52.712 --> 00:26:55.240\nIt's gonna be a pretty boring\ntopology here because they're all\n\n519\n00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.120\non the same subnet, so\nit just looks silly.\n\n520\n00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:02.296\nBut in a network that you are unfamiliar\nwith or you've got a heavily routed\n\n521\n00:27:02.296 --> 00:27:05.892\nnetwork, that topology generator\nis pretty cool, all right?\n\n522\n00:27:05.892 --> 00:27:09.303\nSo there's a lot of other information,\nbut since we only did a ping sweep,\n\n523\n00:27:09.303 --> 00:27:11.480\nwe're not getting any\nof the information yet.\n\n524\n00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.830\nIt's just saying, hey,\nthey're up or they're not up.\n\n525\n00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:16.160\nAnd it's only showing me\nthe ones that are up.\n\n526\n00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.380\nSo there you have Nmap.\n\n527\n00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.410\nWe've got it in all of\nour different platforms.\n\n528\n00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:23.510\nWe saw it on Linux, running it in\nCali from the command line there.\n\n529\n00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:28.710\nWe saw it on Windows,\nusing both ZenMap, the GUI.\n\n530\n00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:32.740\nWe saw that the command line was going to\nbe no different on Windows either, but\n\n531\n00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.910\nusing Nmap to do host discovery.\n\n532\n00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:37.120\nFind out what the heck is\nout there on your network.\n\n533\n00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.887\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\nOld venerable Nmap comes to\n\n534\n00:27:38.887 --> 00:27:39.980\nthe rescue yet again.\n\n535\n00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:41.880\nIt is something that's tried and true.\n\n536\n00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:46.320\nAnd you will encounter and\nuse it as a security professional up here\n\n537\n00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.110\ntrying to implement more\nsecurity in your environment.\n\n538\n00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.130\nSo just dig in your heels.\n\n539\n00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:54.548\nThe man page is your friend\nwhen it comes to Nmap.\n\n540\n00:27:54.548 --> 00:27:57.700\nA lot of great documentation out there for\nit as well.\n\n541\n00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.889\nThat being said, Mike, it looks like\nwe are out of time for this episode.\n\n542\n00:28:00.889 --> 00:28:02.279\nBut perfectly timed, though,\n\n543\n00:28:02.279 --> 00:28:04.860\nbecause you were done showing\nus how to do host discovery.\n\n544\n00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.176\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We try, we try.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, so\n\n545\n00:28:06.176 --> 00:28:10.221\neverybody run out there, grab your copy of\nNmap, start scanning your networks, and\n\n546\n00:28:10.221 --> 00:28:13.120\nfind hosts on them so\nthat you can start mapping it out.\n\n547\n00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.304\nVery cool stuff, thanks for\njoining us today.\n\n548\n00:28:15.304 --> 00:28:16.186\nBut we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n549\n00:28:16.186 --> 00:28:18.470\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n550\n00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:19.414\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n551\n00:28:19.414 --> 00:28:20.649\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n552\n00:28:20.649 --> 00:28:27.657\n[MUSIC]\n\n553\n00:28:27.657 --> 00:28:29.675\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",
