ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.330\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.150\nWith me today is the famous Sean Oriyano.\n\n6\n00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.090\nAnd in this episode Sean\nwe're going to be covering\n\n7\n00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.970\nKali which is something we've got some\nother episodes on but this is Kali 2.0.\n\n8\n00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.400\nSome big changes and\n\n9\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.320\na lot of stuff that we really need\nto take a look at, right Sean?\n\n10\n00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.020\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n11\n00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.252\nYou know, as Mike said,\nwe have talked about Kali\n\n12\n00:00:35.252 --> 00:00:40.220\nbefore and it's been around for a while.\n\n13\n00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.900\nAnd so\nit wasn't actually all that long ago,\n\n14\n00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.050\na couple months ago we just got\nfinished talking about 1.0.\n\n15\n00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.145\nSo what we're doing now of course,\nwe're talking about 2.0.\n\n16\n00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:56.660\n2.0 was released the middle of August,\nAugust eleventh to be specific.\n\n17\n00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.300\nAnd some of you may have gotten\nahold of it at that point in time.\n\n18\n00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.170\nThat's actually a good feat if you did,\nbecause it was, the offensive security\n\n19\n00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.820\nsite was really beaten up that day\nbecause it was such a big deal.\n\n20\n00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.990\nThis was actually debuted at DEF CON.\n\n21\n00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.500\nSo, that's why they held off and\nheld off and held off.\n\n22\n00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.115\nYou saw some before the official\nannouncement at DEF CON, or\n\n23\n00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:28.726\nofficial debut at DEF CON, you saw\nsome images getting bounced around and\n\n24\n00:01:28.726 --> 00:01:33.820\nstuff like that but the real official\none came out right at DEF CON.\n\n25\n00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.260\nThey did some training there and then the\nrest of the world started seeing it and\n\n26\n00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.180\nit's still pretty new to most people.\n\n27\n00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.500\nI mean we're barely talking a month that\nthe thing has been out, so there's a lot\n\n28\n00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.630\nof people out there still learning it and\ngetting used to this whole new version.\n\n29\n00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.010\nWhich it really is, when you look at it,\nis a whole new version.\n\n30\n00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.920\nEven though you may not think\nthat it's anything more than just\n\n31\n00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.840\nan upgrade to the existing one, which is\ntrue, it is an upgrade, but there's so\n\n32\n00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.190\nmuch more to that that we're\ntrying to introduce here.\n\n33\n00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.190\nSo enough that we're gonna spend some\nserious time talking about what makes it\n\n34\n00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.280\ndifferent, some things you can do with it,\nand just kind of\n\n35\n00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.990\nget you familiarized with the differences\nin this product over the previous one.\n\n36\n00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.010\nNow, that doesn't mean,\neven though there's some new stuff, or\n\n37\n00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.460\na good number of new things in Kali 2.0,\nit doesn't mean that you\n\n38\n00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.280\ncan't go back to what we had in\nthe library already for 1.0.\n\n39\n00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.900\nAnd use a lot of that knowledge, cuz\na lot of those tools have carried over.\n\n40\n00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.940\nBut there are some new tools as well, and\n\n41\n00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.940\nwe'll focus on those\nwhenever that comes up.\n\n42\n00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.290\nSo that's really kind of what\nwe're looking at here, and\n\n43\n00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.250\nthat's why we're doing this exploration.\n\n44\n00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.980\nSo let's just kinda talk about the first\nthing, about some of the major things\n\n45\n00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.240\nyou're gonna notice with\nKali when you get into it.\n\n46\n00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.845\nThey did change the pronunciation of it,\nyou speak Kali now, it's Kali.\n\n47\n00:03:02.845 --> 00:03:06.940\n[LAUGH] Just tell her that we\nboth pronounce it different,\n\n48\n00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.370\nand there's not going to be a compromise.\n\n49\n00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.450\n>> We're going to stick to our guns,\nyou know.\n\n50\n00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.378\n>> You just choose the one\nthat's appropriate.\n\n51\n00:03:15.378 --> 00:03:20.217\n[LAUGH]\nAnyway,\n\n52\n00:03:20.217 --> 00:03:23.720\nso, the major differences we\nhave between version one and\n\n53\n00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.620\ntwo, probably the biggest thing people\nare gonna notice is the interface.\n\n54\n00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.960\nInterface is definitely different,\nand I'll show you that in a bit.\n\n55\n00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.770\nBut the interface is different.\n\n56\n00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.130\nIt's not as, well it's a lot\ncleaner is a better way to put it.\n\n57\n00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.265\nIt's a lot cleaner, it's organized\na bit differently over the 1.0 version.\n\n58\n00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:50.505\n1.0 version if you get down to it, in fact\nif you go from Backtrack over to Kali 1.0,\n\n59\n00:03:50.505 --> 00:03:55.790\nto 2.0, you'll notice that the tools went\nmore from just being an afterthought\n\n60\n00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.900\nto all of a sudden being part of the menu,\nto having their own menu in there.\n\n61\n00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.550\nAnd if you remember, when we did 1.0,\nwe went to the menu and\n\n62\n00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.770\nwe had to go all the way down\nto the normal tools in Linux and\n\n63\n00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.570\nthere was a cascading menu that came\nout for the penetration testing stuff.\n\n64\n00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.270\nAnd that opened up into\nseveral different levels.\n\n65\n00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.470\nIt's easy to get lost.\n\n66\n00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.380\nWhen you get down to it.\n\n67\n00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.830\nI mean, there were several times in the\ndemos here, that even though I knew where\n\n68\n00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.310\nthings were in Kali 1.0,\nI would go through and find it,\n\n69\n00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.780\nand I'd still have the menus that go and\npopping in or snapping back or whatever.\n\n70\n00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.560\nSo what they've done is they fixed the\ninterface, or made it a little cleaner, so\n\n71\n00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.180\nit's much more purpose built.\n\n72\n00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.420\nThis really truly is a penetration\ntesting tool when we go to 2.0.\n\n73\n00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.950\nSo that's a great thing.\n\n74\n00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.520\n>> Nice.\n\n75\n00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.970\n>> So, interface is a lot cleaner,\nthe tools that you would use,\n\n76\n00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.750\na lot of them are right\nthere on the surface.\n\n77\n00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.270\nThere's quick access menus in here, so and\n\n78\n00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.320\nthen there are a lot of other\nlittle details in there.\n\n79\n00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.920\nSo, that's the biggest thing that you\nare going to notice when you come into it.\n\n80\n00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.216\nOkay, but just having a new\ninterface that's nothing really.\n\n81\n00:05:03.216 --> 00:05:07.620\nIt is a GNOME based interface by\nthe way for those of you keeping score.\n\n82\n00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.150\nIt is using the interface called GNOME.\n\n83\n00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.720\nGNOME has been around for a while,\nas one of the major Linux interfaces.\n\n84\n00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.020\nSo it's using GNOME, but it's been really,\nreally prettied up and cleaned up.\n\n85\n00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.220\nBut it looks quite nice.\n\n86\n00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.525\nYou know, so that's a big thing.\n\n87\n00:05:22.695 --> 00:05:25.805\nAs far as other changes\nthat have been done,\n\n88\n00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:30.705\nthis is fully supporting\nDebian on the back end.\n\n89\n00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:37.675\nSo, we were using it,\nwhich is a major distro of Linux.\n\n90\n00:05:37.675 --> 00:05:40.755\nThey're using Debian on the back end so\n\n91\n00:05:40.755 --> 00:05:45.230\nthat means that they're really unleashing,\nunlocking the power of one of the full\n\n92\n00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.220\ndistros instead of going after something\nlike Ubuntu or something like that.\n\n93\n00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.720\nThey just bypassed it and\nwent right to what's behind Ubuntu and\n\n94\n00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.430\na lot of the other major ones.\n\n95\n00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.360\nYou know, there's some Some\nbenefits there too by the way,\n\n96\n00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.993\nsince Debian is a major distro of Linux.\n\n97\n00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:04.691\nYou've got a situation where there's\na lot of tools out there that\n\n98\n00:06:04.691 --> 00:06:08.256\nare supported in that, so\nit means that you can add on a lot of your\n\n99\n00:06:08.256 --> 00:06:11.467\nown own tools to Kali to\nenhance its functionality.\n\n100\n00:06:11.467 --> 00:06:14.242\nAnd you're gonna wanna do that,\nyou're definitely gonna wanna do that.\n\n101\n00:06:14.242 --> 00:06:18.167\nAnd I'm gonna show you\nnot only how to add tools\n\n102\n00:06:18.167 --> 00:06:23.160\ninto Kali your own, but I'm also going to\nshow you along the way how to make your\n\n103\n00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.780\nown custom image that\nincorporates those tools.\n\n104\n00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.280\nSo you're not stuck with just using\nwhat offensive security provides,\n\n105\n00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.740\nI'm also going to show you, hey,\ntake a base installation of KOE and\n\n106\n00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.470\ninstall your own tools\ninto it from where ever.\n\n107\n00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.700\nAnd then make your own ISO file out of it\nwhich is a really neat ability to have.\n\n108\n00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.850\nSo those are some cool things.\n\n109\n00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.190\nAnd then just one other\nthing to mention here.\n\n110\n00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.080\nJust remember we're just\ndoing the intro here.\n\n111\n00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.420\nThis isn't what it's limited to.\n\n112\n00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.950\nPlatform support.\n\n113\n00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.710\nPlatform support is much more broad,\nI would say,\n\n114\n00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.960\nwith 2.0 than it was\nwith the previous one.\n\n115\n00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.555\n2.0 supports a wider range of hardware\n\n116\n00:07:07.735 --> 00:07:13.925\nthan we had available or officially\nsupported for 1.0, which is really neat.\n\n117\n00:07:13.925 --> 00:07:15.905\nYou can install it in anything from, well,\n\n118\n00:07:15.905 --> 00:07:20.865\nyou could already do Kali 1.0 on\nthe Raspberry Pi, but you can do 2 on\n\n119\n00:07:20.865 --> 00:07:26.065\nthe Raspberry Pi plus a bunch of other\ndevices if you so choose to do that.\n\n120\n00:07:26.065 --> 00:07:30.060\nIn fact, I saw somebody which\nyou'll find out later on.\n\n121\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.870\nI can't really find any logic\nbehind doing it just because,\n\n122\n00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.200\nother than just saying that you did it,\nwhich sometimes is enough, right?\n\n123\n00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.950\n>> Right. [LAUGH] >> But\nsomebody installed Kali like we have here.\n\n124\n00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:47.757\nThey installed Kali right\non to their smart phone.\n\n125\n00:07:47.757 --> 00:07:51.426\nUnfortunately, no one told them that we\nalready have a version of Kali designed\n\n126\n00:07:51.426 --> 00:07:52.302\nfor smart phones so\n\n127\n00:07:52.302 --> 00:07:55.556\nthey didn't have to spend a week in\ntheir mom's basement doing that.\n\n128\n00:07:55.556 --> 00:07:59.143\n[LAUGH] So oops, sorry.\n\n129\n00:07:59.143 --> 00:08:02.634\nBut let me just give you a quick\nlook at the interface so\n\n130\n00:08:02.634 --> 00:08:06.400\nyou kind of see what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n131\n00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.770\nIs what I have brought up on my screen for\n\n132\n00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.410\nyou is I have Kali and\nI have it running in virtual machine.\n\n133\n00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.390\nSo, just so you know.\n\n134\n00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.190\nSo it's running right\nhere in virtual machine.\n\n135\n00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.190\nYou can see it is a different interface.\n\n136\n00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:25.210\nIt's recognizable to things\nyou've seen in the past.\n\n137\n00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:31.610\nThis isn't really far removed\nfrom what we had in Kali 1.0.\n\n138\n00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.400\nBut it is indeed different.\n\n139\n00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.660\nYou know, you can see it's a lot cleaner.\n\n140\n00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.350\nWe got the quick access\nmenus across the top.\n\n141\n00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.330\nYou know, the pull downs.\n\n142\n00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.120\nYou can see, we've got our other icons.\n\n143\n00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.280\nI'm gonna show you the icons\nin the upper right.\n\n144\n00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.100\nThere's actually some neat\nthings roaming around up there.\n\n145\n00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.610\nBut first of all,\n\n146\n00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.160\nlet me show you about the first part\nof it with the applications menu.\n\n147\n00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.490\nWhen you click on the applications menu,\n\n148\n00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:04.280\nyou'll notice right away that this is\na big deal when you get down to it.\n\n149\n00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.480\nI mean, you look at it,\nit's got this menu that just pops open.\n\n150\n00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.490\nI mean take a look it's got everything\norganized a lot more nicely for you.\n\n151\n00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:16.160\nYou can just instead of just having to go\nthrough menu after menu after menu and\n\n152\n00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.120\nkeep going down to say I\nwanted to do PEN testing.\n\n153\n00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.640\nThen I do information gathering,\nthen I wanna open up this,\n\n154\n00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.420\nthen I wanna open up another sub-menu.\n\n155\n00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.200\nYou don't have to do that.\n\n156\n00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.780\nAnd, that was something that I\nfound kinda irritating before.\n\n157\n00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.740\nIt was just, can we get on with it?\n\n158\n00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.930\nYou know, do I have to keep fishing and\ndigging around?\n\n159\n00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.060\nI felt like I was getting a shovel and\n\n160\n00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.891\njust having to keep digging a hole to\nChina in some cases, to get this stuff.\n\n161\n00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:40.206\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I wanna get right to what I need to do,\n\n162\n00:09:40.206 --> 00:09:42.520\nyou know,\ncuz I've got a thought process going.\n\n163\n00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.410\nWhatever.\n\n164\n00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.880\nSo what you can do here is\njust open the Applications.\n\n165\n00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.250\nAnd it's got everything laid out there for\nyou, okay.\n\n166\n00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.990\nWhat I do want you to keep in\nmind when you're looking at this,\n\n167\n00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:57.670\nthough, is the fact that not\neverything that's available\n\n168\n00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.840\nin Kali is something that's\ngonna show up on a menu.\n\n169\n00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.280\nKali has a substantial, there's\nseveral hundred tools in this product.\n\n170\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.250\nThere's some tools that are strictly\navailable only at the command line.\n\n171\n00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.540\nAnd you're gonna have to open\nup a terminal window and\n\n172\n00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.150\nactually type the name for the tool.\n\n173\n00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.190\nOkay?\nWe haven't got there yet, but\n\n174\n00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:17.790\nI'm just making you aware of that.\n\n175\n00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:22.270\nDon't think that oh,\nthis is the extent of what you've got.\n\n176\n00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.050\nNo, it just means that they put some\nof the more commonly used tools,\n\n177\n00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.970\nthey made them accessible to the menus for\nyou.\n\n178\n00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:32.660\nAnd some of these tools that you'll\nsee on here available on these menus\n\n179\n00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.160\nin fact themselves\nare console based tools.\n\n180\n00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.180\nThey do not have a GUI, they're\njust acting as a quick shortcut for\n\n181\n00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.450\nyou to click on and open the thing up.\n\n182\n00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:48.240\nSo, in that case I think that\nto me is a big, big benefit.\n\n183\n00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.160\nAnd you're gonna notice that there are\nsome new things as I scroll through it,\n\n184\n00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:56.340\nbut we'll talk about\nthose once we get there.\n\n185\n00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.310\nWe'll be talking about some of\nthose things as we go through.\n\n186\n00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:00.850\nWon't be going through\nevery tool in there.\n\n187\n00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.860\nLike I said, this isn't the time for that,\n\n188\n00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:08.470\ncuz a lot of those tools are still\ncarryovers from previous versions.\n\n189\n00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:13.230\nBut there are some new ones\nthat are interesting and\n\n190\n00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:14.460\nones I wanna bring to your attention.\n\n191\n00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.050\nAnd you're gonna have to augment what\nwe're doing here with some of your own\n\n192\n00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:18.734\nexploration.\n\n193\n00:11:18.734 --> 00:11:21.336\n[LAUGH] And trying out.\n\n194\n00:11:21.336 --> 00:11:25.040\nBut that's all well and good for that.\n\n195\n00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.800\nI will tell you something here that's kind\nof interesting about this metasploit.\n\n196\n00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.770\nWe did a whole series of classes,\nyou know, Mike and I on metasploit.\n\n197\n00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:38.100\nMetasploit, you know, you can see that\nit has this little shield you know,\n\n198\n00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.475\nicon however saying\nthe Metasploit framework.\n\n199\n00:11:41.475 --> 00:11:45.845\nThat's just the basic Metasploit product.\n\n200\n00:11:45.845 --> 00:11:48.375\nIf you wanna upgrade for\nanything for there, you wanna go\n\n201\n00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:52.205\nto the higher end versions then you'll\nhave to actually download them.\n\n202\n00:11:52.205 --> 00:11:56.110\nThe versions that were available in\nprevious versions, they just said,\n\n203\n00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.250\nwe're not including that anymore.\n\n204\n00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.520\nWe'll just give you the basic stuff,\n\n205\n00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.210\nif you wanna go up above that,\nyou're gonna have to go and download it.\n\n206\n00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:02.060\nGo to Rapid7.\n\n207\n00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.020\nThey'll still give it to you, but\n\n208\n00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.860\nyou're gonna have to go\nthere to go get it yourself.\n\n209\n00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:11.360\nAnyway, so I just pointed out there,\n\n210\n00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.040\nyou'll notice I pointed out\nsomething on this left-hand side.\n\n211\n00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.230\nThis is your quick launch deal over here.\n\n212\n00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.170\nYou'll notice that it already has some\nstuff that I have not changed since\n\n213\n00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.860\ninstallation at all, by the way.\n\n214\n00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:26.500\nThis installation is just stock, so\n\n215\n00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:31.650\nwhat I've got is, I have just some of\nmy more commonly used tools over there.\n\n216\n00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.550\nAnd I can add to that whenever I want.\n\n217\n00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.930\nIn fact, I went in and added my terminal\nwindow in there, or terminal window.\n\n218\n00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:40.635\nYou know, as one of the viewers in\nhere says, who uses the GUI anyway?\n\n219\n00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, well, you know,\n\n220\n00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:43.180\nwe do use the GUI.\n\n221\n00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.390\nI know he's joking around about it.\n\n222\n00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.930\nBut we go back and\nforth between using the GUI and\n\n223\n00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.510\nterminal applications all\nthe time in doing this.\n\n224\n00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:54.410\nYou know so I just decided well I\nwas going that over on to the left\n\n225\n00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.917\nhand side to make it easy for me.\n\n226\n00:12:56.917 --> 00:13:01.824\nYou also have down at the bottom in\nthe interface you can click on it and\n\n227\n00:13:01.824 --> 00:13:07.338\nyou can get this nice category view of\nyour applications too if you so choose.\n\n228\n00:13:07.338 --> 00:13:10.162\nI really like it, the silky smooth,\n\n229\n00:13:10.162 --> 00:13:15.184\nkind of really clean way they've\ndone the interface of this one.\n\n230\n00:13:15.184 --> 00:13:20.011\nI could very easily do that right\nthere all day, the way things come up.\n\n231\n00:13:20.011 --> 00:13:25.360\n[LAUGH] So you've got those ways\nof accessing your applications.\n\n232\n00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.550\nBut then,\nyou look over here in the upper right.\n\n233\n00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:31.549\nSome stuff you'll recognize.\n\n234\n00:13:31.549 --> 00:13:36.550\nYou can see your volume button, and your\npower button, and all that good stuff.\n\n235\n00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.000\nBut one of the things I think is\nreally cool just to point out,\n\n236\n00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.910\nis you have this little\ncamera icon up there.\n\n237\n00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.290\nThat camera icon, if you click on it.\n\n238\n00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:47.920\nIt actually allows you to go ahead and\n\n239\n00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.610\nfilm the audio and\nvideo of what's going on on screen.\n\n240\n00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:57.090\nI mean think about this, instead of having\nto download screen capture software and\n\n241\n00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:01.100\nto show something that's happening,\nif you're working with a client or you're\n\n242\n00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:05.460\nusing this as a forensics tool because\nyou can use it as a forensics tool.\n\n243\n00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.320\nThey have this built right in there and\n\n244\n00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.290\nas part of product you can say\nokay I want to show this process\n\n245\n00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:14.260\nclick hit start recording, and\nit will just go through your process.\n\n246\n00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.777\nAnd it will just keep saving that out and\nyou're ready to go.\n\n247\n00:14:16.777 --> 00:14:17.900\n>> Wow.\n\n248\n00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.216\n>> Yeah,\nI think that's an incredibly nice feature.\n\n249\n00:14:20.216 --> 00:14:21.714\n>> That's impressive yeah.\n\n250\n00:14:21.714 --> 00:14:26.550\n>> So it's really helping you\nout on that side of things.\n\n251\n00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:30.900\nSome of the stuff that might be\na little confusing, initially,\n\n252\n00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:35.230\nto you is when you hit this\ndown arrow either to log off or\n\n253\n00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.790\ndo your adjustments in here,\nthe system settings are down here.\n\n254\n00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:44.370\nThat's one of the ones that if\nyou noticed here [LAUGH] in our\n\n255\n00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:49.640\nsetup in here, it was like hold on, yeah\nstill getting used to it being over there.\n\n256\n00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.360\nBut, so there's our system settings,\nso if you do get into this and\n\n257\n00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.940\nyou change your screen resolution or\npointing devices or\n\n258\n00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.980\nanything like that,\nthen that's where that is.\n\n259\n00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:59.690\nYou know, so\n\n260\n00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:03.570\nthey have moved some stuff around in\nthere, which can be a little frustrating.\n\n261\n00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.627\nSo Just in case.\n\n262\n00:15:05.627 --> 00:15:07.034\n>> The joys of a new interface.\n\n263\n00:15:07.034 --> 00:15:09.334\nUsually, the benefits far\noutweigh some of those,\n\n264\n00:15:09.334 --> 00:15:11.016\nyou just gotta redefine a few things.\n\n265\n00:15:11.016 --> 00:15:14.332\n>> Yeah, I found, it's absolutely true,\n\n266\n00:15:14.332 --> 00:15:18.690\nI found out that even though\nthis Interface look to be,\n\n267\n00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.886\nwhen you get into it it's like,\nthey changed it.\n\n268\n00:15:22.886 --> 00:15:27.873\nYou weren't getting something like\nthe interface between an XP to Vista,\n\n269\n00:15:27.873 --> 00:15:30.337\nor a 7 to 8, or anything like that.\n\n270\n00:15:30.337 --> 00:15:32.364\nAnd I hear there's a new\nversion of Windows too, but\n\n271\n00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:33.756\nI don't know what version that is.\n\n272\n00:15:33.756 --> 00:15:38.904\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not like that, but\n\n273\n00:15:38.904 --> 00:15:44.890\nit's sort of a huge shift where\nsomething was radically different.\n\n274\n00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.230\nYou can get around this pretty easily.\n\n275\n00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.629\nIt was something that was like\nwell where is this, where is this?\n\n276\n00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:53.039\nSettings honestly was probably\none of the ones that I was like\n\n277\n00:15:53.039 --> 00:15:56.212\nthere was a little icon here for\nthat, where did they put it?\n\n278\n00:15:56.212 --> 00:15:58.276\nAnd it was like oh,\nthey stuck it over here.\n\n279\n00:15:58.276 --> 00:15:59.496\nOkay.\n\n280\n00:15:59.496 --> 00:16:00.728\nThat's it.\n\n281\n00:16:00.728 --> 00:16:02.790\nThat was really the big thing.\n\n282\n00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.060\nThe other cool things to mention with\nCayley is that you can use this interface,\n\n283\n00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.840\nyou can use other interfaces, too.\n\n284\n00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.940\nThere are other interfaces\nthat are lighter weight.\n\n285\n00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:17.230\nYou can use KTE which is another one,\nwhich looks more like the Windows type\n\n286\n00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.490\nfeel, kind of like\nthe start menu type deal.\n\n287\n00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.500\nIf you like that, they've got that.\n\n288\n00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.300\nThen there's other ones that\nare even more lightweight than that,\n\n289\n00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.620\nif you want to go ahead and\nuse that type of deal.\n\n290\n00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.810\nSo you've got the option to mix and\nmatch your interfaces to\n\n291\n00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:36.930\nwhat you feel is going to be\nthe best benefit for you.\n\n292\n00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:37.430\n>> Nice.\n>> Yeah.\n\n293\n00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.640\nSomething I do want to point out though,\n\n294\n00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.418\nthis come at a price, obviously, right?\n\n295\n00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:46.660\n[LAUGH] You are gonna pay for\nit some way or the other.\n\n296\n00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:52.400\nThe system requirements are just\na little bit more with 2.0.\n\n297\n00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.490\nThat's if you use it stock out of the box,\nand have it look like this here.\n\n298\n00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.310\nIf you're going to tweak it and\nuse a different interface,\n\n299\n00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:02.940\nthat will actually lower\nthe system requirements a bit.\n\n300\n00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.540\nSo you can really squeeze that down.\n\n301\n00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.240\nSo other than that,\nthe system requirements, at least for\n\n302\n00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.760\nwhat we're talking about right now,\nare gonna be mostly the same.\n\n303\n00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:19.170\nSo you don't expect to have this huge,\nyou know, titanic shift\n\n304\n00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:23.360\nbetween one versus the other.\n\n305\n00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:27.250\nBut there are some differences, there\nare some improved hardware support for\n\n306\n00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:31.330\nsome of the devices which is great,\nimproved support for\n\n307\n00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.780\ndifferent platforms which is great.\n\n308\n00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.130\nSo there are some benefits but overall.\n\n309\n00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:43.290\nYou've got the system requirements for\nthe stuff that we would generally use.\n\n310\n00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.620\nThey're a little different,\nbut they're not like oh,\n\n311\n00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:46.960\nyou better go get some new hardware.\n\n312\n00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.990\nYou can get some older\nhardware to still run this.\n\n313\n00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:53.160\nI could probably pick up a computer that',\nyou know, 5, 6 years old and\n\n314\n00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.970\nstill run this with very\nlittle adjustment to it.\n\n315\n00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:57.940\nWhich is cool, you know.\n\n316\n00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:02.228\nIn fact I typically encourage people\nto get in to pen testing, you know,\n\n317\n00:18:02.228 --> 00:18:04.000\ndon't get the newest stuff.\n\n318\n00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.050\nThat makes your job way too easy starting.\n\n319\n00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:09.310\nIt sounds like I'm being a jerk about it,\nyou know.\n\n320\n00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:14.700\nIt's like, no, if you use the old stuff,\nnow we can get that stuff cheaper.\n\n321\n00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.110\nYou can run just about a lot of\nthese tools on it just fine.\n\n322\n00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.900\nAnd you'll learn how to,\nyour mind will expand in ways you\n\n323\n00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.840\nhadn't expected when you don't\nhave the newer options available.\n\n324\n00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.760\n[LAUGH] When you've gotta figure\nout how to make something\n\n325\n00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.955\nwork with older technology, but\nthat's something for another time.\n\n326\n00:18:35.955 --> 00:18:40.950\n[LAUGH] We've already come\npretty far as you can see right?\n\n327\n00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:45.760\nThere is quite a bit of differences\nhere but wait, there's more.\n\n328\n00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.280\n>> There's more absolutely.\n\n329\n00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.940\nSo then we get different\nversions I guess.-\n\n330\n00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.350\n>> Yes, there are different versions.\n\n331\n00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.470\nThere's a different model\nessentially between the two of them.\n\n332\n00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.860\nThere's this full version, which is\nwhat you're seeing on screen here.\n\n333\n00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.260\nThis full version has all\nthe graphical benefits.\n\n334\n00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.550\nYou can see everything's all nice and\nsilky smooth when I hit it does the whole\n\n335\n00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:10.280\ndealing cards and\neverything for you type deal.\n\n336\n00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:15.590\nBut there's also a lite version,\nwhich basically does\n\n337\n00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:20.000\naway with all this graphical eye candy\nbs if you want to look at it that way.\n\n338\n00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.920\nIt just says hey I'll get right down\nto business it cuts down on all that\n\n339\n00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.380\ngraphical over head.\n\n340\n00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:29.660\nAnd you've got just right clicks and stuff\nlike that to bring up shortcut menus and\n\n341\n00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.820\nthings like that.\n\n342\n00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.733\nThey designed those for\nsome of those older platforms, or\n\n343\n00:19:33.733 --> 00:19:36.894\nplatforms that just don't have\nthat extra [SOUND] behind them.\n\n344\n00:19:36.894 --> 00:19:44.000\nOr in some cases, who knows, someone\nmay have a modern piece of hardware and\n\n345\n00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.885\ndecide, yeah it's a modern\npiece of hardware, but\n\n346\n00:19:48.885 --> 00:19:53.326\nI don't wanna waste all\nthis horsepower on just\n\n347\n00:19:53.326 --> 00:19:58.395\nmaking something do these\nfancy graphic effects.\n\n348\n00:19:58.395 --> 00:20:02.695\nI want that being pushed over towards\nhow the actual work's being done.\n\n349\n00:20:02.695 --> 00:20:04.375\nSo they did create the lite version too.\n\n350\n00:20:04.375 --> 00:20:09.345\nThe lite version, if you notice it, I\nbelieve it's about a third of the size of\n\n351\n00:20:09.345 --> 00:20:13.225\na download that the main Kali is.\n\n352\n00:20:13.225 --> 00:20:15.740\nKali itself is about three gigs.\n\n353\n00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.490\nI think the other one's like .821 gigs.\n\n354\n00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.400\nSo, you can see there's\na substantial size difference.\n\n355\n00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.470\nMainly because they have stripped out a\nlot of the stuff that makes it, you know,\n\n356\n00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.570\nall nice and pretty and\nmaybe a few other things here and there.\n\n357\n00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:33.600\nBut it's still the same product.\n\n358\n00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.910\nYou can still do the same\npen testing stuff with it,\n\n359\n00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.230\nwhich is what we're looking for.\n\n360\n00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:43.050\nSo you choose if you wanna have\nthe strip down, no bones about it,\n\n361\n00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.650\njust shut your face and\nget down to work one, or\n\n362\n00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.970\nyou wanna have something that\nlooks more pretty here, up to you.\n\n363\n00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.270\n>> And then they've changed\nthe update model as well?\n\n364\n00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:55.060\n>> Yeah, this is, this update model,\n\n365\n00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:59.900\nI think this is probably the biggest\nbenefit you have with this, really.\n\n366\n00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.460\nI mean this all well and\ngood seeing an interface,\n\n367\n00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:07.080\nthis is is absolutely all well and good,\nbut once I've shown you the interface and\n\n368\n00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.790\nhow it looks we'll explore that more.\n\n369\n00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:12.010\nWe can even get rid of that for\nright now, we're done with that.\n\n370\n00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:15.620\nLet's talk about this other\nlittle piece that's going to be.\n\n371\n00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.500\nThat's gonna be a big interest to you.\n\n372\n00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.500\nWhen you look at the update model in Kali,\n\n373\n00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.500\nwhat they've done is in the past, you with\nKali or any of the versions of Linux,\n\n374\n00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.090\nyou would just go through and say,\nwell, I want to apply updates.\n\n375\n00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:33.290\nAnd it would download, you know, updates.\n\n376\n00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:36.240\nBut if there were major updates,\nyou might have actually had to\n\n377\n00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:41.140\ndownload some major stuff, or\nyou may have just had to grab it again.\n\n378\n00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.200\nThere were cases where you had to do that.\n\n379\n00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.150\nWell, what they've done with this one\nis they changed that model a bit.\n\n380\n00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:52.190\nNo longer do you have to\nredownload a bunch of stuff or\n\n381\n00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.470\ngrab individual tools and\nput them in there.\n\n382\n00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:58.560\nWhat they've done is they've gone with\nwhat they call this rolling update model.\n\n383\n00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:03.420\nThis rolling update model allows them\nto slip stream stuff into the product\n\n384\n00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:08.060\na lot quicker so they can just say\nhey we've made a change to something.\n\n385\n00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.180\nWe can just send it right on down\nto you and it improves the product.\n\n386\n00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.730\nThat sounds great,\nyou know it sounds like well, it's great.\n\n387\n00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:18.950\nBut isn't that what, you know,\nWindows and Microsoft has been doing.\n\n388\n00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.785\nNo you're completely wrong,\nget out of my class.\n\n389\n00:22:20.785 --> 00:22:22.690\n[LAUGHS] It's completely different.\n\n390\n00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.010\nNo, it is.\n\n391\n00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:26.340\nIf you just look at a dot level, yeah,\n\n392\n00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.390\nit's what other vendors have been going,\nwith their stuff.\n\n393\n00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:33.180\nBeing able to slip stream stuff\nin if you look at it that way.\n\n394\n00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.030\nBut there's something\nelse that goes with that.\n\n395\n00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:39.830\nIs offensive security\nthe people that make Kali.\n\n396\n00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:45.200\nThey can actually slip stream\nin new tools in there and\n\n397\n00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.820\nupdates tool much, much quicker\nthan you ever could do before.\n\n398\n00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.720\nSo you don't have to go search for\nupdates for individual tools.\n\n399\n00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.890\nThey can just start shooting\nthose things in there.\n\n400\n00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:56.600\nIf they want to put a new tool in there\nfor you, they can just shoot it right on\n\n401\n00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.390\ndown the line to you and\nit will show up on your product, you know.\n\n402\n00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:03.870\nSo it means that you\ncan keep this product.\n\n403\n00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.400\nUp to date much, much quicker and much,\n\n404\n00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.320\nmuch more effectively than\nyou ever could before.\n\n405\n00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:13.780\nBefore you were gonna get notices of\nupdates and have to go through and do,\n\n406\n00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.300\nthe whole jazz that way.\n\n407\n00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:22.900\nNo, this way, you have the shift from\none to two, which did a big shift.\n\n408\n00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.140\nBut if they wanna add in more tools,\nand make bigger changes to it,\n\n409\n00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.880\nit's not like their going to have to\ngo from two to three just for that.\n\n410\n00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.570\nI mean they will go from two to three at\nsome point, who knows when that will be,\n\n411\n00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.330\nbut they'll go from two\nto three at some point.\n\n412\n00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:38.810\nThe benefit that they've done is,\n\n413\n00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:42.590\ntwo is that it's not such a major thing\nfor them to have to do it just for\n\n414\n00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.940\nthe fact we want to included a bunch of\nnew stuff and change a bunch of things.\n\n415\n00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:49.270\nThey can do a lot of that buy\njust slipping these updates in.\n\n416\n00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:51.210\nMuch more rapidly and\n\n417\n00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:54.220\nmuch more effectively than they\never could with the prior version.\n\n418\n00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:59.720\nSo it means you can effectively have a new\nversion, an updated version all the time.\n\n419\n00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.260\nAnd it will check for those things.\n\n420\n00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.600\nI believe it checks, I wanna say, I think\nit's, don't quote me on it, but I think\n\n421\n00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:09.160\nit's like four times a day it will check\nfor updates on it, just automatically.\n\n422\n00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.730\nAnd so you should be ready to go, and\nthere's even buttons in there where,\n\n423\n00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.440\nif you're really paranoid you\ncan click and say do a check for\n\n424\n00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.540\nupdates and it will check for you.\n\n425\n00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.980\nAnd I've noticed they have\nalready put some, you know,\n\n426\n00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.870\nupdates and stuff like that.\n\n427\n00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:25.610\nNot security updates, but\njust updates saying, oh well\n\n428\n00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:29.390\nwe're gonna add in something here or tweak\nthis, or include something else here.\n\n429\n00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:34.000\nYou know, so that's a big, big thing.\n\n430\n00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.140\nSo really, really cool and\n\n431\n00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:40.660\nexciting things that you have with\nthe improvements in the interface,\n\n432\n00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.590\nwith the improvements in the tools,\njust being easier to get around.\n\n433\n00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.950\nThe broader hardware support and\n\n434\n00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:50.620\njust a bunch of other things we have yet\nto get into.\n\n435\n00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:58.120\nIt really makes Kali worth it to jump\nover to, Jump from one over into 2 now.\n\n436\n00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.920\nLike we said, you can use just about\neverything you learned in 1 in 2,\n\n437\n00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.970\nbut we're going to build on top of that,\nso\n\n438\n00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:11.630\nwe're not going to spend the same\nlength of time on 2 that we did on 1.\n\n439\n00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:14.870\nWe are going to introduce you to\nsome new stuff here along the way.\n\n440\n00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.530\nGet you familiar with things so\n\n441\n00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:20.290\nkinda get some excitement to get some\nadditional exploring on your own.\n\n442\n00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:21.850\n>> Very good.\nAll right well Sean, I'll tell you what.\n\n443\n00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:22.550\nA great episode.\n\n444\n00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:25.310\nA lot of good information out as we move\n\n445\n00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.750\nfrom previous versions\nof Kali to Kali 2.0.\n\n446\n00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.390\nA brand new interface.\n\n447\n00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:34.000\nProbably easier to navigate around,\npretty update model.\n\n448\n00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000\nAll kinds of good stuff.\n\n449\n00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.910\nLooking forward to the rest of the show\nas we cover some of those new features.\n\n450\n00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:41.040\nBut for now, we are out of time.\n\n451\n00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:44.040\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n452\n00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.100\n>> And I am Sean Oriyano.\n\n453\n00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.140\n>> And we'll see you tomorrow.\n\n",
