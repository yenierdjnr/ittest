ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.330\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.150\nWith me today is the famous Sean Oriyano.\n\n6\n00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.090\nAnd in this episode Sean\nwe're going to be covering\n\n7\n00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.970\nKali which is something we've got some\nother episodes on but this is Kali 2.0.\n\n8\n00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.400\nSome big changes and\n\n9\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.320\na lot of stuff that we really need\nto take a look at, right Sean?\n\n10\n00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.020\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n11\n00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.252\nYou know, as Mike said,\nwe have talked about Kali\n\n12\n00:00:35.252 --> 00:00:40.220\nbefore and it's been around for a while.\n\n13\n00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.900\nAnd so\nit wasn't actually all that long ago,\n\n14\n00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.050\na couple months ago we just got\nfinished talking about 1.0.\n\n15\n00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.145\nSo what we're doing now of course,\nwe're talking about 2.0.\n\n16\n00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:56.660\n2.0 was released the middle of August,\nAugust eleventh to be specific.\n\n17\n00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.300\nAnd some of you may have gotten\nahold of it at that point in time.\n\n18\n00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.170\nThat's actually a good feat if you did,\nbecause it was, the offensive security\n\n19\n00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.820\nsite was really beaten up that day\nbecause it was such a big deal.\n\n20\n00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.990\nThis was actually debuted at DEF CON.\n\n21\n00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.500\nSo, that's why they held off and\nheld off and held off.\n\n22\n00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.115\nYou saw some before the official\nannouncement at DEF CON, or\n\n23\n00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:28.726\nofficial debut at DEF CON, you saw\nsome images getting bounced around and\n\n24\n00:01:28.726 --> 00:01:33.820\nstuff like that but the real official\none came out right at DEF CON.\n\n25\n00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.260\nThey did some training there and then the\nrest of the world started seeing it and\n\n26\n00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.180\nit's still pretty new to most people.\n\n27\n00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.500\nI mean we're barely talking a month that\nthe thing has been out, so there's a lot\n\n28\n00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.630\nof people out there still learning it and\ngetting used to this whole new version.\n\n29\n00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.010\nWhich it really is, when you look at it,\nis a whole new version.\n\n30\n00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.920\nEven though you may not think\nthat it's anything more than just\n\n31\n00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.840\nan upgrade to the existing one, which is\ntrue, it is an upgrade, but there's so\n\n32\n00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.190\nmuch more to that that we're\ntrying to introduce here.\n\n33\n00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.190\nSo enough that we're gonna spend some\nserious time talking about what makes it\n\n34\n00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.280\ndifferent, some things you can do with it,\nand just kind of\n\n35\n00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.990\nget you familiarized with the differences\nin this product over the previous one.\n\n36\n00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.010\nNow, that doesn't mean,\neven though there's some new stuff, or\n\n37\n00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.460\na good number of new things in Kali 2.0,\nit doesn't mean that you\n\n38\n00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.280\ncan't go back to what we had in\nthe library already for 1.0.\n\n39\n00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.900\nAnd use a lot of that knowledge, cuz\na lot of those tools have carried over.\n\n40\n00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.940\nBut there are some new tools as well, and\n\n41\n00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.940\nwe'll focus on those\nwhenever that comes up.\n\n42\n00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.290\nSo that's really kind of what\nwe're looking at here, and\n\n43\n00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.250\nthat's why we're doing this exploration.\n\n44\n00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.980\nSo let's just kinda talk about the first\nthing, about some of the major things\n\n45\n00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.240\nyou're gonna notice with\nKali when you get into it.\n\n46\n00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.845\nThey did change the pronunciation of it,\nyou speak Kali now, it's Kali.\n\n47\n00:03:02.845 --> 00:03:06.940\n[LAUGH] Just tell her that we\nboth pronounce it different,\n\n48\n00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.370\nand there's not going to be a compromise.\n\n49\n00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.450\n>> We're going to stick to our guns,\nyou know.\n\n50\n00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.378\n>> You just choose the one\nthat's appropriate.\n\n51\n00:03:15.378 --> 00:03:20.217\n[LAUGH]\nAnyway,\n\n52\n00:03:20.217 --> 00:03:23.720\nso, the major differences we\nhave between version one and\n\n53\n00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.620\ntwo, probably the biggest thing people\nare gonna notice is the interface.\n\n54\n00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.960\nInterface is definitely different,\nand I'll show you that in a bit.\n\n55\n00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.770\nBut the interface is different.\n\n56\n00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.130\nIt's not as, well it's a lot\ncleaner is a better way to put it.\n\n57\n00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.265\nIt's a lot cleaner, it's organized\na bit differently over the 1.0 version.\n\n58\n00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:50.505\n1.0 version if you get down to it, in fact\nif you go from Backtrack over to Kali 1.0,\n\n59\n00:03:50.505 --> 00:03:55.790\nto 2.0, you'll notice that the tools went\nmore from just being an afterthought\n\n60\n00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.900\nto all of a sudden being part of the menu,\nto having their own menu in there.\n\n61\n00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.550\nAnd if you remember, when we did 1.0,\nwe went to the menu and\n\n62\n00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.770\nwe had to go all the way down\nto the normal tools in Linux and\n\n63\n00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.570\nthere was a cascading menu that came\nout for the penetration testing stuff.\n\n64\n00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.270\nAnd that opened up into\nseveral different levels.\n\n65\n00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.470\nIt's easy to get lost.\n\n66\n00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.380\nWhen you get down to it.\n\n67\n00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.830\nI mean, there were several times in the\ndemos here, that even though I knew where\n\n68\n00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.310\nthings were in Kali 1.0,\nI would go through and find it,\n\n69\n00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.780\nand I'd still have the menus that go and\npopping in or snapping back or whatever.\n\n70\n00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.560\nSo what they've done is they fixed the\ninterface, or made it a little cleaner, so\n\n71\n00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.180\nit's much more purpose built.\n\n72\n00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.420\nThis really truly is a penetration\ntesting tool when we go to 2.0.\n\n73\n00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.950\nSo that's a great thing.\n\n74\n00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.520\n>> Nice.\n\n75\n00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.970\n>> So, interface is a lot cleaner,\nthe tools that you would use,\n\n76\n00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.750\na lot of them are right\nthere on the surface.\n\n77\n00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.270\nThere's quick access menus in here, so and\n\n78\n00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.320\nthen there are a lot of other\nlittle details in there.\n\n79\n00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.920\nSo, that's the biggest thing that you\nare going to notice when you come into it.\n\n80\n00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.216\nOkay, but just having a new\ninterface that's nothing really.\n\n81\n00:05:03.216 --> 00:05:07.620\nIt is a GNOME based interface by\nthe way for those of you keeping score.\n\n82\n00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.150\nIt is using the interface called GNOME.\n\n83\n00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.720\nGNOME has been around for a while,\nas one of the major Linux interfaces.\n\n84\n00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.020\nSo it's using GNOME, but it's been really,\nreally prettied up and cleaned up.\n\n85\n00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.220\nBut it looks quite nice.\n\n86\n00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.525\nYou know, so that's a big thing.\n\n87\n00:05:22.695 --> 00:05:25.805\nAs far as other changes\nthat have been done,\n\n88\n00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:30.705\nthis is fully supporting\nDebian on the back end.\n\n89\n00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:37.675\nSo, we were using it,\nwhich is a major distro of Linux.\n\n90\n00:05:37.675 --> 00:05:40.755\nThey're using Debian on the back end so\n\n91\n00:05:40.755 --> 00:05:45.230\nthat means that they're really unleashing,\nunlocking the power of one of the full\n\n92\n00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.220\ndistros instead of going after something\nlike Ubuntu or something like that.\n\n93\n00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.720\nThey just bypassed it and\nwent right to what's behind Ubuntu and\n\n94\n00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.430\na lot of the other major ones.\n\n95\n00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.360\nYou know, there's some Some\nbenefits there too by the way,\n\n96\n00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.993\nsince Debian is a major distro of Linux.\n\n97\n00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:04.691\nYou've got a situation where there's\na lot of tools out there that\n\n98\n00:06:04.691 --> 00:06:08.256\nare supported in that, so\nit means that you can add on a lot of your\n\n99\n00:06:08.256 --> 00:06:11.467\nown own tools to Kali to\nenhance its functionality.\n\n100\n00:06:11.467 --> 00:06:14.242\nAnd you're gonna wanna do that,\nyou're definitely gonna wanna do that.\n\n101\n00:06:14.242 --> 00:06:18.167\nAnd I'm gonna show you\nnot only how to add tools\n\n102\n00:06:18.167 --> 00:06:23.160\ninto Kali your own, but I'm also going to\nshow you along the way how to make your\n\n103\n00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.780\nown custom image that\nincorporates those tools.\n\n104\n00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.280\nSo you're not stuck with just using\nwhat offensive security provides,\n\n105\n00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.740\nI'm also going to show you, hey,\ntake a base installation of KOE and\n\n106\n00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.470\ninstall your own tools\ninto it from where ever.\n\n107\n00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.700\nAnd then make your own ISO file out of it\nwhich is a really neat ability to have.\n\n108\n00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.850\nSo those are some cool things.\n\n109\n00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.190\nAnd then just one other\nthing to mention here.\n\n110\n00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.080\nJust remember we're just\ndoing the intro here.\n\n111\n00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.420\nThis isn't what it's limited to.\n\n112\n00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.950\nPlatform support.\n\n113\n00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.710\nPlatform support is much more broad,\nI would say,\n\n114\n00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.960\nwith 2.0 than it was\nwith the previous one.\n\n115\n00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.555\n2.0 supports a wider range of hardware\n\n116\n00:07:07.735 --> 00:07:13.925\nthan we had available or officially\nsupported for 1.0, which is really neat.\n\n117\n00:07:13.925 --> 00:07:15.905\nYou can install it in anything from, well,\n\n118\n00:07:15.905 --> 00:07:20.865\nyou could already do Kali 1.0 on\nthe Raspberry Pi, but you can do 2 on\n\n119\n00:07:20.865 --> 00:07:26.065\nthe Raspberry Pi plus a bunch of other\ndevices if you so choose to do that.\n\n120\n00:07:26.065 --> 00:07:30.060\nIn fact, I saw somebody which\nyou'll find out later on.\n\n121\n00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.870\nI can't really find any logic\nbehind doing it just because,\n\n122\n00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.200\nother than just saying that you did it,\nwhich sometimes is enough, right?\n\n123\n00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.950\n>> Right. [LAUGH] >> But\nsomebody installed Kali like we have here.\n\n124\n00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:47.757\nThey installed Kali right\non to their smart phone.\n\n125\n00:07:47.757 --> 00:07:51.426\nUnfortunately, no one told them that we\nalready have a version of Kali designed\n\n126\n00:07:51.426 --> 00:07:52.302\nfor smart phones so\n\n127\n00:07:52.302 --> 00:07:55.556\nthey didn't have to spend a week in\ntheir mom's basement doing that.\n\n128\n00:07:55.556 --> 00:07:59.143\n[LAUGH] So oops, sorry.\n\n129\n00:07:59.143 --> 00:08:02.634\nBut let me just give you a quick\nlook at the interface so\n\n130\n00:08:02.634 --> 00:08:06.400\nyou kind of see what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n131\n00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.770\nIs what I have brought up on my screen for\n\n132\n00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:13.410\nyou is I have Kali and\nI have it running in virtual machine.\n\n133\n00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.390\nSo, just so you know.\n\n134\n00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.190\nSo it's running right\nhere in virtual machine.\n\n135\n00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.190\nYou can see it is a different interface.\n\n136\n00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:25.210\nIt's recognizable to things\nyou've seen in the past.\n\n137\n00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:31.610\nThis isn't really far removed\nfrom what we had in Kali 1.0.\n\n138\n00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.400\nBut it is indeed different.\n\n139\n00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.660\nYou know, you can see it's a lot cleaner.\n\n140\n00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.350\nWe got the quick access\nmenus across the top.\n\n141\n00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.330\nYou know, the pull downs.\n\n142\n00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.120\nYou can see, we've got our other icons.\n\n143\n00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.280\nI'm gonna show you the icons\nin the upper right.\n\n144\n00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.100\nThere's actually some neat\nthings roaming around up there.\n\n145\n00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.610\nBut first of all,\n\n146\n00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.160\nlet me show you about the first part\nof it with the applications menu.\n\n147\n00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.490\nWhen you click on the applications menu,\n\n148\n00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:04.280\nyou'll notice right away that this is\na big deal when you get down to it.\n\n149\n00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.480\nI mean, you look at it,\nit's got this menu that just pops open.\n\n150\n00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.490\nI mean take a look it's got everything\norganized a lot more nicely for you.\n\n151\n00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:16.160\nYou can just instead of just having to go\nthrough menu after menu after menu and\n\n152\n00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.120\nkeep going down to say I\nwanted to do PEN testing.\n\n153\n00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.640\nThen I do information gathering,\nthen I wanna open up this,\n\n154\n00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.420\nthen I wanna open up another sub-menu.\n\n155\n00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.200\nYou don't have to do that.\n\n156\n00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.780\nAnd, that was something that I\nfound kinda irritating before.\n\n157\n00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.740\nIt was just, can we get on with it?\n\n158\n00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.930\nYou know, do I have to keep fishing and\ndigging around?\n\n159\n00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.060\nI felt like I was getting a shovel and\n\n160\n00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.891\njust having to keep digging a hole to\nChina in some cases, to get this stuff.\n\n161\n00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:40.206\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I wanna get right to what I need to do,\n\n162\n00:09:40.206 --> 00:09:42.520\nyou know,\ncuz I've got a thought process going.\n\n163\n00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.410\nWhatever.\n\n164\n00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.880\nSo what you can do here is\njust open the Applications.\n\n165\n00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.250\nAnd it's got everything laid out there for\nyou, okay.\n\n166\n00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.990\nWhat I do want you to keep in\nmind when you're looking at this,\n\n167\n00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:57.670\nthough, is the fact that not\neverything that's available\n\n168\n00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.840\nin Kali is something that's\ngonna show up on a menu.\n\n169\n00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.280\nKali has a substantial, there's\nseveral hundred tools in this product.\n\n170\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.250\nThere's some tools that are strictly\navailable only at the command line.\n\n171\n00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.540\nAnd you're gonna have to open\nup a terminal window and\n\n172\n00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.150\nactually type the name for the tool.\n\n173\n00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.190\nOkay?\nWe haven't got there yet, but\n\n174\n00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:17.790\nI'm just making you aware of that.\n\n175\n00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:22.270\nDon't think that oh,\nthis is the extent of what you've got.\n\n176\n00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.050\nNo, it just means that they put some\nof the more commonly used tools,\n\n177\n00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.970\nthey made them accessible to the menus for\nyou.\n\n178\n00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:32.660\nAnd some of these tools that you'll\nsee on here available on these menus\n\n179\n00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.160\nin fact themselves\nare console based tools.\n\n180\n00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.180\nThey do not have a GUI, they're\njust acting as a quick shortcut for\n\n181\n00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.450\nyou to click on and open the thing up.\n\n182\n00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:48.240\nSo, in that case I think that\nto me is a big, big benefit.\n\n183\n00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.160\nAnd you're gonna notice that there are\nsome new things as I scroll through it,\n\n184\n00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:56.340\nbut we'll talk about\nthose once we get there.\n\n185\n00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.310\nWe'll be talking about some of\nthose things as we go through.\n\n186\n00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:00.850\nWon't be going through\nevery tool in there.\n\n187\n00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:02.860\nLike I said, this isn't the time for that,\n\n188\n00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:08.470\ncuz a lot of those tools are still\ncarryovers from previous versions.\n\n189\n00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:13.230\nBut there are some new ones\nthat are interesting and\n\n190\n00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:14.460\nones I wanna bring to your attention.\n\n191\n00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.050\nAnd you're gonna have to augment what\nwe're doing here with some of your own\n\n192\n00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:18.734\nexploration.\n\n193\n00:11:18.734 --> 00:11:21.336\n[LAUGH] And trying out.\n\n194\n00:11:21.336 --> 00:11:25.040\nBut that's all well and good for that.\n\n195\n00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.800\nI will tell you something here that's kind\nof interesting about this metasploit.\n\n196\n00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.770\nWe did a whole series of classes,\nyou know, Mike and I on metasploit.\n\n197\n00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:38.100\nMetasploit, you know, you can see that\nit has this little shield you know,\n\n198\n00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.475\nicon however saying\nthe Metasploit framework.\n\n199\n00:11:41.475 --> 00:11:45.845\nThat's just the basic Metasploit product.\n\n200\n00:11:45.845 --> 00:11:48.375\nIf you wanna upgrade for\nanything for there, you wanna go\n\n201\n00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:52.205\nto the higher end versions then you'll\nhave to actually download them.\n\n202\n00:11:52.205 --> 00:11:56.110\nThe versions that were available in\nprevious versions, they just said,\n\n203\n00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.250\nwe're not including that anymore.\n\n204\n00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.520\nWe'll just give you the basic stuff,\n\n205\n00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.210\nif you wanna go up above that,\nyou're gonna have to go and download it.\n\n206\n00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:02.060\nGo to Rapid7.\n\n207\n00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.020\nThey'll still give it to you, but\n\n208\n00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.860\nyou're gonna have to go\nthere to go get it yourself.\n\n209\n00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:11.360\nAnyway, so I just pointed out there,\n\n210\n00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.040\nyou'll notice I pointed out\nsomething on this left-hand side.\n\n211\n00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.230\nThis is your quick launch deal over here.\n\n212\n00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.170\nYou'll notice that it already has some\nstuff that I have not changed since\n\n213\n00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.860\ninstallation at all, by the way.\n\n214\n00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:26.500\nThis installation is just stock, so\n\n215\n00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:31.650\nwhat I've got is, I have just some of\nmy more commonly used tools over there.\n\n216\n00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.550\nAnd I can add to that whenever I want.\n\n217\n00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.930\nIn fact, I went in and added my terminal\nwindow in there, or terminal window.\n\n218\n00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:40.635\nYou know, as one of the viewers in\nhere says, who uses the GUI anyway?\n\n219\n00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:42.330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, well, you know,\n\n220\n00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:43.180\nwe do use the GUI.\n\n221\n00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.390\nI know he's joking around about it.\n\n222\n00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.930\nBut we go back and\nforth between using the GUI and\n\n223\n00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.510\nterminal applications all\nthe time in doing this.\n\n224\n00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:54.410\nYou know so I just decided well I\nwas going that over on to the left\n\n225\n00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.917\nhand side to make it easy for me.\n\n226\n00:12:56.917 --> 00:13:01.824\nYou also have down at the bottom in\nthe interface you can click on it and\n\n227\n00:13:01.824 --> 00:13:07.338\nyou can get this nice category view of\nyour applications too if you so choose.\n\n228\n00:13:07.338 --> 00:13:10.162\nI really like it, the silky smooth,\n\n229\n00:13:10.162 --> 00:13:15.184\nkind of really clean way they've\ndone the interface of this one.\n\n230\n00:13:15.184 --> 00:13:20.011\nI could very easily do that right\nthere all day, the way things come up.\n\n231\n00:13:20.011 --> 00:13:25.360\n[LAUGH] So you've got those ways\nof accessing your applications.\n\n232\n00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.550\nBut then,\nyou look over here in the upper right.\n\n233\n00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:31.549\nSome stuff you'll recognize.\n\n234\n00:13:31.549 --> 00:13:36.550\nYou can see your volume button, and your\npower button, and all that good stuff.\n\n235\n00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.000\nBut one of the things I think is\nreally cool just to point out,\n\n236\n00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.910\nis you have this little\ncamera icon up there.\n\n237\n00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.290\nThat camera icon, if you click on it.\n\n238\n00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:47.920\nIt actually allows you to go ahead and\n\n239\n00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.610\nfilm the audio and\nvideo of what's going on on screen.\n\n240\n00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:57.090\nI mean think about this, instead of having\nto download screen capture software and\n\n241\n00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:01.100\nto show something that's happening,\nif you're working with a client or you're\n\n242\n00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:05.460\nusing this as a forensics tool because\nyou can use it as a forensics tool.\n\n243\n00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.320\nThey have this built right in there and\n\n244\n00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.290\nas part of product you can say\nokay I want to show this process\n\n245\n00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:14.260\nclick hit start recording, and\nit will just go through your process.\n\n246\n00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.777\nAnd it will just keep saving that out and\nyou're ready to go.\n\n247\n00:14:16.777 --> 00:14:17.900\n>> Wow.\n\n248\n00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.216\n>> Yeah,\nI think that's an incredibly nice feature.\n\n249\n00:14:20.216 --> 00:14:21.714\n>> That's impressive yeah.\n\n250\n00:14:21.714 --> 00:14:26.550\n>> So it's really helping you\nout on that side of things.\n\n251\n00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:30.900\nSome of the stuff that might be\na little confusing, initially,\n\n252\n00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:35.230\nto you is when you hit this\ndown arrow either to log off or\n\n253\n00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.790\ndo your adjustments in here,\nthe system settings are down here.\n\n254\n00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:44.370\nThat's one of the ones that if\nyou noticed here [LAUGH] in our\n\n255\n00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:49.640\nsetup in here, it was like hold on, yeah\nstill getting used to it being over there.\n\n256\n00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.360\nBut, so there's our system settings,\nso if you do get into this and\n\n257\n00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.940\nyou change your screen resolution or\npointing devices or\n\n258\n00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:58.980\nanything like that,\nthen that's where that is.\n\n259\n00:14:58.980 --> 00:14:59.690\nYou know, so\n\n260\n00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:03.570\nthey have moved some stuff around in\nthere, which can be a little frustrating.\n\n261\n00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.627\nSo Just in case.\n\n262\n00:15:05.627 --> 00:15:07.034\n>> The joys of a new interface.\n\n263\n00:15:07.034 --> 00:15:09.334\nUsually, the benefits far\noutweigh some of those,\n\n264\n00:15:09.334 --> 00:15:11.016\nyou just gotta redefine a few things.\n\n265\n00:15:11.016 --> 00:15:14.332\n>> Yeah, I found, it's absolutely true,\n\n266\n00:15:14.332 --> 00:15:18.690\nI found out that even though\nthis Interface look to be,\n\n267\n00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.886\nwhen you get into it it's like,\nthey changed it.\n\n268\n00:15:22.886 --> 00:15:27.873\nYou weren't getting something like\nthe interface between an XP to Vista,\n\n269\n00:15:27.873 --> 00:15:30.337\nor a 7 to 8, or anything like that.\n\n270\n00:15:30.337 --> 00:15:32.364\nAnd I hear there's a new\nversion of Windows too, but\n\n271\n00:15:32.364 --> 00:15:33.756\nI don't know what version that is.\n\n272\n00:15:33.756 --> 00:15:38.904\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not like that, but\n\n273\n00:15:38.904 --> 00:15:44.890\nit's sort of a huge shift where\nsomething was radically different.\n\n274\n00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.230\nYou can get around this pretty easily.\n\n275\n00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.629\nIt was something that was like\nwell where is this, where is this?\n\n276\n00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:53.039\nSettings honestly was probably\none of the ones that I was like\n\n277\n00:15:53.039 --> 00:15:56.212\nthere was a little icon here for\nthat, where did they put it?\n\n278\n00:15:56.212 --> 00:15:58.276\nAnd it was like oh,\nthey stuck it over here.\n\n279\n00:15:58.276 --> 00:15:59.496\nOkay.\n\n280\n00:15:59.496 --> 00:16:00.728\nThat's it.\n\n281\n00:16:00.728 --> 00:16:02.790\nThat was really the big thing.\n\n282\n00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.060\nThe other cool things to mention with\nCayley is that you can use this interface,\n\n283\n00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.840\nyou can use other interfaces, too.\n\n284\n00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.940\nThere are other interfaces\nthat are lighter weight.\n\n285\n00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:17.230\nYou can use KTE which is another one,\nwhich looks more like the Windows type\n\n286\n00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.490\nfeel, kind of like\nthe start menu type deal.\n\n287\n00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.500\nIf you like that, they've got that.\n\n288\n00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.300\nThen there's other ones that\nare even more lightweight than that,\n\n289\n00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.620\nif you want to go ahead and\nuse that type of deal.\n\n290\n00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.810\nSo you've got the option to mix and\nmatch your interfaces to\n\n291\n00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:36.930\nwhat you feel is going to be\nthe best benefit for you.\n\n292\n00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:37.430\n>> Nice.\n>> Yeah.\n\n293\n00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.640\nSomething I do want to point out though,\n\n294\n00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.418\nthis come at a price, obviously, right?\n\n295\n00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:46.660\n[LAUGH] You are gonna pay for\nit some way or the other.\n\n296\n00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:52.400\nThe system requirements are just\na little bit more with 2.0.\n\n297\n00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.490\nThat's if you use it stock out of the box,\nand have it look like this here.\n\n298\n00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.310\nIf you're going to tweak it and\nuse a different interface,\n\n299\n00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:02.940\nthat will actually lower\nthe system requirements a bit.\n\n300\n00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.540\nSo you can really squeeze that down.\n\n301\n00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.240\nSo other than that,\nthe system requirements, at least for\n\n302\n00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.760\nwhat we're talking about right now,\nare gonna be mostly the same.\n\n303\n00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:19.170\nSo you don't expect to have this huge,\nyou know, titanic shift\n\n304\n00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:23.360\nbetween one versus the other.\n\n305\n00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:27.250\nBut there are some differences, there\nare some improved hardware support for\n\n306\n00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:31.330\nsome of the devices which is great,\nimproved support for\n\n307\n00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.780\ndifferent platforms which is great.\n\n308\n00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.130\nSo there are some benefits but overall.\n\n309\n00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:43.290\nYou've got the system requirements for\nthe stuff that we would generally use.\n\n310\n00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.620\nThey're a little different,\nbut they're not like oh,\n\n311\n00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:46.960\nyou better go get some new hardware.\n\n312\n00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.990\nYou can get some older\nhardware to still run this.\n\n313\n00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:53.160\nI could probably pick up a computer that',\nyou know, 5, 6 years old and\n\n314\n00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.970\nstill run this with very\nlittle adjustment to it.\n\n315\n00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:57.940\nWhich is cool, you know.\n\n316\n00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:02.228\nIn fact I typically encourage people\nto get in to pen testing, you know,\n\n317\n00:18:02.228 --> 00:18:04.000\ndon't get the newest stuff.\n\n318\n00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.050\nThat makes your job way too easy starting.\n\n319\n00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:09.310\nIt sounds like I'm being a jerk about it,\nyou know.\n\n320\n00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:14.700\nIt's like, no, if you use the old stuff,\nnow we can get that stuff cheaper.\n\n321\n00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.110\nYou can run just about a lot of\nthese tools on it just fine.\n\n322\n00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.900\nAnd you'll learn how to,\nyour mind will expand in ways you\n\n323\n00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.840\nhadn't expected when you don't\nhave the newer options available.\n\n324\n00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.760\n[LAUGH] When you've gotta figure\nout how to make something\n\n325\n00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.955\nwork with older technology, but\nthat's something for another time.\n\n326\n00:18:35.955 --> 00:18:40.950\n[LAUGH] We've already come\npretty far as you can see right?\n\n327\n00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:45.760\nThere is quite a bit of differences\nhere but wait, there's more.\n\n328\n00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.280\n>> There's more absolutely.\n\n329\n00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.940\nSo then we get different\nversions I guess.-\n\n330\n00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.350\n>> Yes, there are different versions.\n\n331\n00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.470\nThere's a different model\nessentially between the two of them.\n\n332\n00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.860\nThere's this full version, which is\nwhat you're seeing on screen here.\n\n333\n00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.260\nThis full version has all\nthe graphical benefits.\n\n334\n00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.550\nYou can see everything's all nice and\nsilky smooth when I hit it does the whole\n\n335\n00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:10.280\ndealing cards and\neverything for you type deal.\n\n336\n00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:15.590\nBut there's also a lite version,\nwhich basically does\n\n337\n00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:20.000\naway with all this graphical eye candy\nbs if you want to look at it that way.\n\n338\n00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.920\nIt just says hey I'll get right down\nto business it cuts down on all that\n\n339\n00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.380\ngraphical over head.\n\n340\n00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:29.660\nAnd you've got just right clicks and stuff\nlike that to bring up shortcut menus and\n\n341\n00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.820\nthings like that.\n\n342\n00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.733\nThey designed those for\nsome of those older platforms, or\n\n343\n00:19:33.733 --> 00:19:36.894\nplatforms that just don't have\nthat extra [SOUND] behind them.\n\n344\n00:19:36.894 --> 00:19:44.000\nOr in some cases, who knows, someone\nmay have a modern piece of hardware and\n\n345\n00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.885\ndecide, yeah it's a modern\npiece of hardware, but\n\n346\n00:19:48.885 --> 00:19:53.326\nI don't wanna waste all\nthis horsepower on just\n\n347\n00:19:53.326 --> 00:19:58.395\nmaking something do these\nfancy graphic effects.\n\n348\n00:19:58.395 --> 00:20:02.695\nI want that being pushed over towards\nhow the actual work's being done.\n\n349\n00:20:02.695 --> 00:20:04.375\nSo they did create the lite version too.\n\n350\n00:20:04.375 --> 00:20:09.345\nThe lite version, if you notice it, I\nbelieve it's about a third of the size of\n\n351\n00:20:09.345 --> 00:20:13.225\na download that the main Kali is.\n\n352\n00:20:13.225 --> 00:20:15.740\nKali itself is about three gigs.\n\n353\n00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.490\nI think the other one's like .821 gigs.\n\n354\n00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.400\nSo, you can see there's\na substantial size difference.\n\n355\n00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.470\nMainly because they have stripped out a\nlot of the stuff that makes it, you know,\n\n356\n00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.570\nall nice and pretty and\nmaybe a few other things here and there.\n\n357\n00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:33.600\nBut it's still the same product.\n\n358\n00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.910\nYou can still do the same\npen testing stuff with it,\n\n359\n00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.230\nwhich is what we're looking for.\n\n360\n00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:43.050\nSo you choose if you wanna have\nthe strip down, no bones about it,\n\n361\n00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.650\njust shut your face and\nget down to work one, or\n\n362\n00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.970\nyou wanna have something that\nlooks more pretty here, up to you.\n\n363\n00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.270\n>> And then they've changed\nthe update model as well?\n\n364\n00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:55.060\n>> Yeah, this is, this update model,\n\n365\n00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:59.900\nI think this is probably the biggest\nbenefit you have with this, really.\n\n366\n00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.460\nI mean this all well and\ngood seeing an interface,\n\n367\n00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:07.080\nthis is is absolutely all well and good,\nbut once I've shown you the interface and\n\n368\n00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.790\nhow it looks we'll explore that more.\n\n369\n00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:12.010\nWe can even get rid of that for\nright now, we're done with that.\n\n370\n00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:15.620\nLet's talk about this other\nlittle piece that's going to be.\n\n371\n00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.500\nThat's gonna be a big interest to you.\n\n372\n00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.500\nWhen you look at the update model in Kali,\n\n373\n00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.500\nwhat they've done is in the past, you with\nKali or any of the versions of Linux,\n\n374\n00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.090\nyou would just go through and say,\nwell, I want to apply updates.\n\n375\n00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:33.290\nAnd it would download, you know, updates.\n\n376\n00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:36.240\nBut if there were major updates,\nyou might have actually had to\n\n377\n00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:41.140\ndownload some major stuff, or\nyou may have just had to grab it again.\n\n378\n00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.200\nThere were cases where you had to do that.\n\n379\n00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.150\nWell, what they've done with this one\nis they changed that model a bit.\n\n380\n00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:52.190\nNo longer do you have to\nredownload a bunch of stuff or\n\n381\n00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.470\ngrab individual tools and\nput them in there.\n\n382\n00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:58.560\nWhat they've done is they've gone with\nwhat they call this rolling update model.\n\n383\n00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:03.420\nThis rolling update model allows them\nto slip stream stuff into the product\n\n384\n00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:08.060\na lot quicker so they can just say\nhey we've made a change to something.\n\n385\n00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.180\nWe can just send it right on down\nto you and it improves the product.\n\n386\n00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:14.730\nThat sounds great,\nyou know it sounds like well, it's great.\n\n387\n00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:18.950\nBut isn't that what, you know,\nWindows and Microsoft has been doing.\n\n388\n00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.785\nNo you're completely wrong,\nget out of my class.\n\n389\n00:22:20.785 --> 00:22:22.690\n[LAUGHS] It's completely different.\n\n390\n00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.010\nNo, it is.\n\n391\n00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:26.340\nIf you just look at a dot level, yeah,\n\n392\n00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.390\nit's what other vendors have been going,\nwith their stuff.\n\n393\n00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:33.180\nBeing able to slip stream stuff\nin if you look at it that way.\n\n394\n00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.030\nBut there's something\nelse that goes with that.\n\n395\n00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:39.830\nIs offensive security\nthe people that make Kali.\n\n396\n00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:45.200\nThey can actually slip stream\nin new tools in there and\n\n397\n00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.820\nupdates tool much, much quicker\nthan you ever could do before.\n\n398\n00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.720\nSo you don't have to go search for\nupdates for individual tools.\n\n399\n00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.890\nThey can just start shooting\nthose things in there.\n\n400\n00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:56.600\nIf they want to put a new tool in there\nfor you, they can just shoot it right on\n\n401\n00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.390\ndown the line to you and\nit will show up on your product, you know.\n\n402\n00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:03.870\nSo it means that you\ncan keep this product.\n\n403\n00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.400\nUp to date much, much quicker and much,\n\n404\n00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.320\nmuch more effectively than\nyou ever could before.\n\n405\n00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:13.780\nBefore you were gonna get notices of\nupdates and have to go through and do,\n\n406\n00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.300\nthe whole jazz that way.\n\n407\n00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:22.900\nNo, this way, you have the shift from\none to two, which did a big shift.\n\n408\n00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.140\nBut if they wanna add in more tools,\nand make bigger changes to it,\n\n409\n00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.880\nit's not like their going to have to\ngo from two to three just for that.\n\n410\n00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.570\nI mean they will go from two to three at\nsome point, who knows when that will be,\n\n411\n00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.330\nbut they'll go from two\nto three at some point.\n\n412\n00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:38.810\nThe benefit that they've done is,\n\n413\n00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:42.590\ntwo is that it's not such a major thing\nfor them to have to do it just for\n\n414\n00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.940\nthe fact we want to included a bunch of\nnew stuff and change a bunch of things.\n\n415\n00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:49.270\nThey can do a lot of that buy\njust slipping these updates in.\n\n416\n00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:51.210\nMuch more rapidly and\n\n417\n00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:54.220\nmuch more effectively than they\never could with the prior version.\n\n418\n00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:59.720\nSo it means you can effectively have a new\nversion, an updated version all the time.\n\n419\n00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.260\nAnd it will check for those things.\n\n420\n00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.600\nI believe it checks, I wanna say, I think\nit's, don't quote me on it, but I think\n\n421\n00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:09.160\nit's like four times a day it will check\nfor updates on it, just automatically.\n\n422\n00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.730\nAnd so you should be ready to go, and\nthere's even buttons in there where,\n\n423\n00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.440\nif you're really paranoid you\ncan click and say do a check for\n\n424\n00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.540\nupdates and it will check for you.\n\n425\n00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.980\nAnd I've noticed they have\nalready put some, you know,\n\n426\n00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:22.870\nupdates and stuff like that.\n\n427\n00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:25.610\nNot security updates, but\njust updates saying, oh well\n\n428\n00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:29.390\nwe're gonna add in something here or tweak\nthis, or include something else here.\n\n429\n00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:34.000\nYou know, so that's a big, big thing.\n\n430\n00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.140\nSo really, really cool and\n\n431\n00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:40.660\nexciting things that you have with\nthe improvements in the interface,\n\n432\n00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:44.590\nwith the improvements in the tools,\njust being easier to get around.\n\n433\n00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.950\nThe broader hardware support and\n\n434\n00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:50.620\njust a bunch of other things we have yet\nto get into.\n\n435\n00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:58.120\nIt really makes Kali worth it to jump\nover to, Jump from one over into 2 now.\n\n436\n00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.920\nLike we said, you can use just about\neverything you learned in 1 in 2,\n\n437\n00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.970\nbut we're going to build on top of that,\nso\n\n438\n00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:11.630\nwe're not going to spend the same\nlength of time on 2 that we did on 1.\n\n439\n00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:14.870\nWe are going to introduce you to\nsome new stuff here along the way.\n\n440\n00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.530\nGet you familiar with things so\n\n441\n00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:20.290\nkinda get some excitement to get some\nadditional exploring on your own.\n\n442\n00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:21.850\n>> Very good.\nAll right well Sean, I'll tell you what.\n\n443\n00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:22.550\nA great episode.\n\n444\n00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:25.310\nA lot of good information out as we move\n\n445\n00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:28.750\nfrom previous versions\nof Kali to Kali 2.0.\n\n446\n00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.390\nA brand new interface.\n\n447\n00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:34.000\nProbably easier to navigate around,\npretty update model.\n\n448\n00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000\nAll kinds of good stuff.\n\n449\n00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.910\nLooking forward to the rest of the show\nas we cover some of those new features.\n\n450\n00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:41.040\nBut for now, we are out of time.\n\n451\n00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:44.040\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n452\n00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.100\n>> And I am Sean Oriyano.\n\n453\n00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.140\n>> And we'll see you tomorrow.\n\n",

00:00:14.190\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.230\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.673\nAnd Sean in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:17.673 --> 00:00:21.358\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\nsomething called Kali NetHunter.\n\n7\n00:00:21.358 --> 00:00:24.415\nAnd this is similar to what we've\nalready been looking at, but\n\n8\n00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:26.110\nit's slightly different.\n\n9\n00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.120\nSo what are the differences here, Sean?\n\n10\n00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.460\n>> Well, it's one of those things that\nit's the same, but it's different.\n\n11\n00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.930\nIt sounds like double speak,\nand it is, but it isn't.\n\n12\n00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.850\nThat's the best way to see it,\nit sounds like double speak, well it is,\n\n13\n00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.430\nbut it isn't.\n\n14\n00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.188\nStop doing that.\n\n15\n00:00:46.188 --> 00:00:52.260\n>> [LAUGH] Can you use double\nspeak to explain double speak?\n\n16\n00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.560\nThat shouldn't be allowed.\n\n17\n00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.355\n>> Well, apparently you can.\n\n18\n00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.010\n[LAUGH]\n>> Evidently.\n\n19\n00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.660\n>> We're doing the impossible\nhere at IT Pro TV.\n\n20\n00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.490\n>> So what the heck is NetHunter?\n\n21\n00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.550\nI got to the Kali Web page,\nI see I can download Kali.\n\n22\n00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.090\nBut then I've got Kali NetHunter.\n\n23\n00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.960\nDifferent option.\n\n24\n00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.880\nWhy would I want that one?\n\n25\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.580\nWhat is it?\n\n26\n00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.630\n>> Yeah, they're both basically,\nwhen we say the same, they both provide\n\n27\n00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.940\nthe same amount of functionality, the same\ntypes of functionality in a broad sense.\n\n28\n00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.820\nSo, they're both siblings, cousins,\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n29\n00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.250\nYou know the same type of thing.\n\n30\n00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.640\nThey are both used for pen testing.\n\n31\n00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.520\nThey have a lot of the same tools,\nsame between both of them.\n\n32\n00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.200\nNot all of them, do not expect the same\nstuff you see in Kali to jump ship and\n\n33\n00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.000\ngo right over to NetHunter,\nbut they are very close, and\n\n34\n00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.140\njust because it is not in NetHunter\ndoes not mean you either cannot\n\n35\n00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.510\nput that tool in NetHunter, or\nyou can find an equivalent.\n\n36\n00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:58.190\nYou know, so it's the same in a lot of\nsenses, but it's not the same in others.\n\n37\n00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.510\nNow, NetHunter is designed for mobile\ndevices and it's designed for mobile\n\n38\n00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.100\ndevices running In Android, so you're\nnot going to find anything, at least\n\n39\n00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.020\nnot right now or at least not supported\nthat's going to run anything like iOS.\n\n40\n00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.520\nThey designed it specifically for\n\n41\n00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.960\nthe Android platform, because basically\nAndroid has got that Linux base.\n\n42\n00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.090\nIt's open and it's easy to develop for,\nso they were able to go ahead and\n\n43\n00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.710\njust port it over there fairly easily.\n\n44\n00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:31.730\nAnd because they did that we've got all\nthis power in a very small form factor.\n\n45\n00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.840\nA potentially small form factor.\n\n46\n00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.420\nI've got my Nexus 5 device sitting here.\n\n47\n00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.184\nMy Nexus 5 device,\nthis does have Kali NetHunter on it and\n\n48\n00:02:43.184 --> 00:02:46.110\nthat means it's got a lot of power.\n\n49\n00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.380\nI've taken Kali NetHunter,\n\n50\n00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.655\ninstalled it on here, this is running\nthis latest version of Android.\n\n51\n00:02:52.655 --> 00:02:56.975\nNot 6, but 5, 6 is unreleased so\njust in case,\n\n52\n00:02:56.975 --> 00:03:02.055\nbut it's running a 5 series of Android,\nand then it's got\n\n53\n00:03:02.055 --> 00:03:07.050\nNetHunter installed on top of it, and then\nI've done some modifications on to it,\n\n54\n00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.323\nto kind of give it's own little upgrade\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n55\n00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:12.230\n>> And work out to make it all stronger.\n\n56\n00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.180\nSo there's a lot of power\nsitting here in this device\n\n57\n00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.640\nwith the purpose of doing pen testing.\n\n58\n00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.230\nSo that's just a really neat thing.\n\n59\n00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.730\nAnd really think about this for\n\n60\n00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.860\na second is that I have gone from having\nto need something like my notebook,\n\n61\n00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.040\nyou know like I have got sitting\nhere right now in front of me,\n\n62\n00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.070\nwhere I would have had to take this\nnotebook or you know to do the job before,\n\n63\n00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.930\nyou know I have gone from\nnotebook to you know this guy.\n\n64\n00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.430\nYou know so\nit makes a tremendous amount of benefit.\n\n65\n00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.720\nI like the fact the fact that with very\nlittle effort I got this thing and\n\n66\n00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.860\nI can just go through and slide it into\nmy pocket, it doesn't draw attention or\n\n67\n00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.830\nanything else, I can let it run.\n\n68\n00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.500\nIt just makes my life easier,\nmakes it easier for\n\n69\n00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.250\nme to blend in, than it would be for me to\npull out a notebook and start typing away.\n\n70\n00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.470\nSo there's a lot of benefits in this, and\n\n71\n00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.470\nthat's the great thing about NetHunter,\nreally.\n\n72\n00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.550\n>> And that was a Nexus 5,\n\n73\n00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.310\nwhich is definitely not the latest\nNexus that's out there.\n\n74\n00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.380\nSo that's kind of nice.\n\n75\n00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.668\nI can go back to older hardware.\n\n76\n00:04:17.668 --> 00:04:21.419\nI know Ben in our chatroom there\nmentioned Nexus 5, 6 7 9, 10.\n\n77\n00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.360\nSo there's a lot of different platforms\nthat support or that we could put this on.\n\n78\n00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.890\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n79\n00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:35.720\nSo it really opens up the options for you.\n\n80\n00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.470\nSo, kinda gotta really like that.\n\n81\n00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.390\nIn fact, as far as support goes,\nwhat I've done to help you out here,\n\n82\n00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.540\non my screen,\nthis is on the Offensive Security site.\n\n83\n00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.208\nThese are the devices as of right\nnow that NetHunter goes on,\n\n84\n00:04:53.208 --> 00:05:00.096\nso you've got Nexus 4 and 5, so\nif you really want to go back to Nexus 4,\n\n85\n00:05:00.096 --> 00:05:06.230\nI can't remember what age that is,\nI want to say a 5 is 2013.\n\n86\n00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.580\nSo, a form of 4's going to\nbe a little older than that,\n\n87\n00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.590\nand then you've got the Nexus 7,\nvery easy to get your hands on those.\n\n88\n00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.230\nI've got three of those, and\ntwo of them I got for together,\n\n89\n00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.220\nbrand new, for about 120 bucks for\nboth of them in one shot.\n\n90\n00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.660\nEasy to get your hands on and\ndo this stuff with.\n\n91\n00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.610\nSo you can build a pen testing\nplatform pretty quickly with that.\n\n92\n00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.430\nThere's the Nexus 10, the Nexus 6,\nif you want another mobile phone.\n\n93\n00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.994\nThere's the 9 if you want a nice\nkeyboard and all that, and\n\n94\n00:05:45.994 --> 00:05:51.505\nthen there's even the one plus one phones,\ntold you I'd mess that up.\n\n95\n00:05:51.505 --> 00:05:52.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I want to say one plus,\n\n96\n00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.830\nand one plus one, whatever.\n\n97\n00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.824\nI was going to say one plus one,\nbut no that sounds stupid,\n\n98\n00:05:57.824 --> 00:06:00.040\nwho would call their\ndevice a one plus one?\n\n99\n00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.825\nWell apparently, we've got Ben knows and\nKali knows, and I'm an idiot.\n\n100\n00:06:04.825 --> 00:06:09.680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it gives you some pretty\n\n101\n00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.690\ncool options, and\nyou can see here it's available in 2.0.\n\n102\n00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.540\nSo the code base and everything matches\nwhat we have on the desktop side.\n\n103\n00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.660\nAnd you can see what we have down here\nat the bottom on the download page,\n\n104\n00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:26.840\nyou can see it even has, you know\nthose old names like KitKat, Lollipop,\n\n105\n00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.470\nand those ones,\nthose are versions 4 and 5 of Android.\n\n106\n00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.070\nThat's what that refers to.\n\n107\n00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.750\nOkay.\n\n108\n00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.530\nNow don't worry, this is kind\nof to give you the overview of\n\n109\n00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.860\nwhat you can do with Kali,\nor Kali NetHunter rather.\n\n110\n00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.580\nOne of the things we've got planned for\nthis week, and not to ruin the surprise,\n\n111\n00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.110\nis I'm going to show you how to build one\nof these devices on a Nexus 7 tablet.\n\n112\n00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.380\nSo if you do want to see how to do that,\njust stay tuned.\n\n113\n00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.054\nSo we're gonna grab a Nexus 7 tablet, and\n\n114\n00:06:59.054 --> 00:07:04.769\nwe're gonna take that Nexus 7 tablet,\nand we're gonna wipe it,\n\n115\n00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:09.270\nand set it up here in\nreal-time with NetHunter.\n\n116\n00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.640\nSo if you guys want to start grabbing\nyour old NetHunter device, or\n\n117\n00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.420\ngrab a Nexus 7 device and\n\n118\n00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:22.360\nbe prepared to do that along with us,\nhey, you got that coming up,\n\n119\n00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.755\nand I think we're scheduled to do that on\nWednesday, so you've got a couple of days.\n\n120\n00:07:26.755 --> 00:07:29.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Overnight shipping is what I'm talking\n\n121\n00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:29.860\nabout people.\n\n122\n00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:30.663\n>> There you go.\n\n123\n00:07:30.663 --> 00:07:32.269\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n124\n00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:35.710\nthat should be exciting probably for\na lot of you.\n\n125\n00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:40.480\nAnd I would encourage you, I would\ndefinitely encourage you to do stuff, to\n\n126\n00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:46.520\nuse, to err try using Kali or\nuse an android device to do pen testing.\n\n127\n00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.372\nIt's a whole new experience.\n\n128\n00:07:48.372 --> 00:07:53.904\nAnd I know some people have\nactually downloaded tools like,\n\n129\n00:07:53.904 --> 00:07:57.374\nthere's one like IP Tools and Fing and\n\n130\n00:07:57.374 --> 00:08:01.712\nstuff like that on the On\nthe Google Play store,\n\n131\n00:08:01.712 --> 00:08:06.052\nwe're way outside that\nwith Kali NetHunter and\n\n132\n00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:11.934\nthe device that I've got on me,\nI've got way even beyond that.\n\n133\n00:08:11.934 --> 00:08:15.334\nI've got a lot of black market stuff and\nthings like that, that I've tested and\n\n134\n00:08:15.334 --> 00:08:15.960\nput on there.\n\n135\n00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.999\nI'm at the point now, because it's so\nopen, I'm doing Android programming,\n\n136\n00:08:20.999 --> 00:08:25.683\nI've developed my own stuff on top of\nit because it opens up so many things.\n\n137\n00:08:25.683 --> 00:08:26.390\nSo, kind of neat stuff.\n\n138\n00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.215\nGuess I shouldn't have told people\nI'm developing my own stuff.\n\n139\n00:08:29.215 --> 00:08:30.640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Gonna have a weapon now.\n\n140\n00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.895\nI'm gonna get stopped at the airport.\n\n141\n00:08:31.895 --> 00:08:34.660\n>> [LAUGH] Ben asked a question\nout there in the chat room.\n\n142\n00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.410\nHe asked,\ndo you find it any more difficult\n\n143\n00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.760\nnot having a full sized\nkeyboard working with that?\n\n144\n00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:45.890\n>> [LAUGH] That's such a great question.\n\n145\n00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:51.800\nIt all depends on how comfortable\nyou are with a touch screen.\n\n146\n00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:58.490\nFor me, for someone grabbing my\ncellphone and opening this thing up.\n\n147\n00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:04.771\nI'm okay by going through and typing on\nthese small little keyboards that come up.\n\n148\n00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:09.464\nI'm getting better at it, but if you're\nsomething that's been cursed with fat\n\n149\n00:09:09.464 --> 00:09:14.381\nfingers or something like that, that's\nnot meant to be derogatory, so calm down.\n\n150\n00:09:14.381 --> 00:09:17.456\n>> I can see where the GUI might be pretty\neasy but some of those command line\n\n151\n00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:20.136\nutilities where you really gotta\ntype commands in and stuff.\n\n152\n00:09:20.136 --> 00:09:24.907\n>> That could be, the keyboard will\nstill remain the same size, but\n\n153\n00:09:24.907 --> 00:09:28.051\nthe command lines might be a little small.\n\n154\n00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:30.870\nBut fortunately, you can adjust\nthe text on a lot of these things.\n\n155\n00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.800\nNow, if you're trying to do it\non a device like this, yeah,\n\n156\n00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.340\nit's gonna be like whoa,\nwhat's going on there?\n\n157\n00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.780\nIf you're on something like a tablet,\nyou have more screen real estate so\n\n158\n00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.510\nit becomes a little bit easier.\n\n159\n00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:50.840\nSo I guess the thing in here is,\nis it tough doing it?\n\n160\n00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.530\nYes and no.\n\n161\n00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:55.029\nIf you're pretty good at texting on\na keyboard and going through and\n\n162\n00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.080\ndoing stuff that way,\nthen hey, if you can do that,\n\n163\n00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:05.640\nyour kung fu type stuff on that\nkeyboard back and forth, go for it!\n\n164\n00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.500\nYou're probably just fine.\n\n165\n00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.190\nIf you're not, then you may want\nto consider getting a larger\n\n166\n00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.190\ndevice like a tablet that\nhas more screen real estate,\n\n167\n00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.879\nthus bigger buttons on there\nmakes it easier for you.\n\n168\n00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.716\nAnd then I saw on here it says\nget a Bluetooth keyboard but\n\n169\n00:10:21.716 --> 00:10:25.313\nthen like it was noted on here,\nyou're back to having a laptop.\n\n170\n00:10:25.313 --> 00:10:28.706\nI had that option with my Nexus\ntablets of getting a keyboard and\n\n171\n00:10:28.706 --> 00:10:33.266\nI was this close to getting one, and I'm\nlike, no, that just defeats the purpose.\n\n172\n00:10:33.266 --> 00:10:37.691\nIf I want a keyboard on something, then\nyeah, I'll just carry this around with me.\n\n173\n00:10:37.691 --> 00:10:41.805\nI didn't want to do that, so I got used\nto doing it with this type of stuff.\n\n174\n00:10:41.805 --> 00:10:45.240\nSo, you'll figure out a way to adapt for\nit.\n\n175\n00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.919\nIt's not going to be the same experience.\n\n176\n00:10:46.919 --> 00:10:48.591\nI'll tell you that right away.\n\n177\n00:10:48.591 --> 00:10:52.068\n>> All right, and then tool wise,\nI think you mentioned not all of the tools\n\n178\n00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:55.950\nare available in NetHunter that we\nsee in the full install of Kali.\n\n179\n00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.140\n>> Yeah, it's not everything's\ngoing to be over there.\n\n180\n00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:03.840\nThere's going to be a lot of things\nthat do come over, but not all of them.\n\n181\n00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.530\nDon't expect things like\nvulnerability scanners to come over.\n\n182\n00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.210\nSo things like OpenVas and Nexus,\nthose aren't going to come over.\n\n183\n00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.630\nEven though, you go in\nthe Google Play store, it says heck,\n\n184\n00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:18.880\nyou could install Nexus\non your Android platform.\n\n185\n00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.460\nThat's basically a line\nof crap cuz what that is,\n\n186\n00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.840\nwhat they're doing is they're saying,\nhey, we're installing the Nexus client.\n\n187\n00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.330\nYou still have to have APC or something in\nsome place else that you're terminaling\n\n188\n00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.840\ninto and connecting to to run\nthe vulnerability scan over there.\n\n189\n00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.080\nTo me, that runs counter to what\nI'm trying to accomplish here.\n\n190\n00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.840\nI want something that's\ncompletely self-contained and\n\n191\n00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.280\ndoesn't arouse any suspicion.\n\n192\n00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.970\nAnd I may be some place where I\nneed to be completely off the grid,\n\n193\n00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.480\nthat when I did this thing,\nwhen I built this thing the way it is,\n\n194\n00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:52.720\nI wanted to limit as much as I\ncould any external connections.\n\n195\n00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.890\nI wanted to be able to keep this\nthing up to date and then boom.\n\n196\n00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:56.630\nGot it.\n\n197\n00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.870\nSo tools.\n\n198\n00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:03.440\nJust because it's Android,\nthere's so many tools out there.\n\n199\n00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:10.077\nThe question is is just, how far are you\nwilling to take this, would be the thing.\n\n200\n00:12:10.077 --> 00:12:11.771\nYou can take this pretty far.\n\n201\n00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:16.750\nAnd the reason why I'm kind of saying how\nwilling are you is that first of all,\n\n202\n00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.902\nyou've got to invest your time.\n\n203\n00:12:18.902 --> 00:12:22.425\nI do this for a living, so I'm willing\nto do the research and checks and\n\n204\n00:12:22.425 --> 00:12:23.400\neverything on it.\n\n205\n00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.756\nBut the other thing I kind of have on\nthis, when I'm doing something like this,\n\n206\n00:12:27.756 --> 00:12:32.258\nis that a lot of those tools, you're not\ngonna find them on the Google Play Store.\n\n207\n00:12:32.258 --> 00:12:35.182\nSo if you're someone that's saying,\nhey, I want to do hacking,\n\n208\n00:12:35.182 --> 00:12:39.050\nlet me go into Google play and\ntype in hacking and see what comes up.\n\n209\n00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.280\nThis probably isn't the device for you.\n\n210\n00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.568\nWhat you're going to need to do is\nyou're going to need to go out and\n\n211\n00:12:44.568 --> 00:12:48.583\nGoogle and search for APKs and stuff,\nwhich APK is a little installation thing.\n\n212\n00:12:48.583 --> 00:12:52.226\nAnd the APKs that are not on the Google\nPlay Store, if you try to install them,\n\n213\n00:12:52.226 --> 00:12:55.984\nit's going to freak out and it'll say\nwhoa, this came from an unknown source,\n\n214\n00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:58.197\nI don't know who this is and\neverything else.\n\n215\n00:12:58.197 --> 00:13:01.307\nYou're just gonna have\nto take a deep breath,\n\n216\n00:13:01.307 --> 00:13:06.690\nturn off the safety features, and\ninstall it and see what happens.\n\n217\n00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:07.670\nThat's what took me so\n\n218\n00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:11.900\nlong to get these devices set up is\nI had to do a lot of testing on them.\n\n219\n00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.720\nThat's why I've got this device,\nwhich I use every day for my calls.\n\n220\n00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:20.180\nAnd then I have another one that I do my\ntesting on, to make sure that that one,\n\n221\n00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.090\nany tools that I have in there that\nare not beaming anything out that\n\n222\n00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:25.120\nI don't want or anything like that.\n\n223\n00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.930\nSo, it does take a little a more work, but\n\n224\n00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.070\nthere already is a pretty\nrobust set of tools built in.\n\n225\n00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.680\nSo that's the good thing.\n\n226\n00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.210\n>> And then,\nas far as system requirements go,\n\n227\n00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.760\nthere are some limitations\nwe got to deal with?\n\n228\n00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.399\n>> Yeah, there are some\nlimitations to this to be sure.\n\n229\n00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:47.973\nIn fact, I see in the discussion group\nyou've got Ben sitting over there and\n\n230\n00:13:47.973 --> 00:13:52.431\nhe's talking about something\ncalled the Nokia N9000.\n\n231\n00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:54.509\nThat is an older device.\n\n232\n00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:57.880\nI forget how old that thing is.\n\n233\n00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:04.780\nBut the Nokia, not N9000,\nN900 that is a, the reason why\n\n234\n00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.550\nyou want to look at something like this\nand let me see if I can bring it up here.\n\n235\n00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.310\nUsually you are going to have\nto look on Ebay or something.\n\n236\n00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:15.270\nYeah, I found, I believe this is\nthe N900 right here I have on my screen.\n\n237\n00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:21.720\nThis is the, and where this fits into\nthe whole hardware limitations is that\n\n238\n00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.955\nsomething like this,\nthis has NFC, bluetooth and\n\n239\n00:14:25.955 --> 00:14:29.210\nwi-fi in it in addition to\nthe normal cell phone functions.\n\n240\n00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:34.300\nThat's great, and you might,\njust going into this you're like,\n\n241\n00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.570\nhey it's got bluetooth and wi-fi,\nyou want to be able to do that.\n\n242\n00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.920\nAll the fun games that go with\ncracking and hacking into wi-fi and\n\n243\n00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.950\nmessing with Bluetooth ain't gonna\nhappen with this because what you\n\n244\n00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:52.630\nhave to do is you have to get what they\ncall an OTG cable, a USB on the go cable.\n\n245\n00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:57.395\nIt plugs into your micro USB port and\nthen gives you a full-blown USB port.\n\n246\n00:14:57.395 --> 00:15:02.335\nAnd what you'll do is you plug in\nan external Bluetooth adapter or\n\n247\n00:15:02.335 --> 00:15:07.375\nan external wi-fi adapter that has\nthe ability to do promiscuous mode,\n\n248\n00:15:07.375 --> 00:15:09.289\nor in the case of Bluetooth, monitor mode.\n\n249\n00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:17.150\nThere's pretty much with some exceptions\nvery few cell phones that have the ability\n\n250\n00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:23.280\nto do promiscuous mode with wi-fi,\nand I haven't really seen any that can\n\n251\n00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.840\ndo any of the Bluetooth stuff other than\njust do the pairings and associations.\n\n252\n00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.250\nHence, you gotta use an external adaptor.\n\n253\n00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:34.593\nThe Nokia N900 is an exception because it\nbreaks at least one of those limitations.\n\n254\n00:15:34.593 --> 00:15:39.428\nThe limitation on this one, or that it\nbreaks is that it can do promiscuous mode\n\n255\n00:15:39.428 --> 00:15:41.787\nwith its WiFi adaptor, internally.\n\n256\n00:15:41.787 --> 00:15:46.026\nSo you don't have to do that, but\nyou would still need to have something for\n\n257\n00:15:46.026 --> 00:15:48.870\nBluetooth if you want to\nstart messing with that.\n\n258\n00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:52.882\nSo these ones you should be able to\nget if you do wanna go ahead and\n\n259\n00:15:52.882 --> 00:15:56.455\nget one of these things,\nthey're not that expensive.\n\n260\n00:15:56.455 --> 00:16:00.790\nThere's one, it's 129 bucks on eBay.\n\n261\n00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:06.240\nThese things are not brand new, so you're\npretty much gonna be picking these things\n\n262\n00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:12.200\nup used for the most part, but\nif you want it, there you go.\n\n263\n00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.600\nNow, yeah, there's talk,\n\n264\n00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.870\nthere's been some murmurs about\nputting Kali NetHunter on this one.\n\n265\n00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.093\nYou can get the Pwnie Express,\nthe Pwn Phone stuff,\n\n266\n00:16:21.093 --> 00:16:24.220\nyou can get it to put\non there already today.\n\n267\n00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:28.450\nAnd we'll talk about that another day,\ntoo, so that's not off the hook either,\n\n268\n00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.500\nwe're just talking about Kali right now.\n\n269\n00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.360\nSo, there are some hardware limitations,\nand typically the hardware limitations\n\n270\n00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:39.370\nare gonna be with the wi-fi and\nwith the bluetooth side of things.\n\n271\n00:16:41.192 --> 00:16:44.350\n>> All right Sean, and\nthen you're gonna give us a peak at Kali.\n\n272\n00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.160\nOr I should say Net Hunter,\nright, not Kali.\n\n273\n00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.210\n>> It's very, very, very close.\n\n274\n00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:54.340\nReally the best way to do it,\nbecause we're gonna show for\n\n275\n00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:58.620\nright now, is to kinda give you\na quick peek at what you can expect.\n\n276\n00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.080\nAnd because we have such\na wide range of devices,\n\n277\n00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.700\nwhat I want to do is\ngive you kinda of a quick\n\n278\n00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:09.420\nlook at what you can expect when\nyou look into the Kali interface.\n\n279\n00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.320\nIn fact, first of all, if you look on my\nscreen here with the different devices,\n\n280\n00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:19.660\nyou can see that Kali's got a pretty\nclean interface as far as that goes.\n\n281\n00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.610\nIt's got the typical Android interface,\neverything on there.\n\n282\n00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:28.568\nWhat it boils down to,\nwhen you turn on Kali and NetHunter,\n\n283\n00:17:28.568 --> 00:17:33.477\nyou're gonna see something like this,\nand then it's up to you after that\n\n284\n00:17:33.477 --> 00:17:37.456\nto start loading your applications\non there if you want it.\n\n285\n00:17:37.456 --> 00:17:42.274\nSo you're just gonna be presented\nwith something very basic, like this.\n\n286\n00:17:42.274 --> 00:17:46.260\nThe reason why I'm not showing it\nlive on here is because we're gonna\n\n287\n00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.471\nbe doing something with Kali anyway.\n\n288\n00:17:48.471 --> 00:17:50.386\nSo you're really gonna\nget hands-on with it.\n\n289\n00:17:50.386 --> 00:17:55.331\nBut what you have here, this is\npretty much the standard interface.\n\n290\n00:17:55.331 --> 00:17:58.283\nIf you open it up on one\nof these Nexus devices,\n\n291\n00:17:58.283 --> 00:18:01.552\nyou'll get the exact same\ninterface you see here.\n\n292\n00:18:01.552 --> 00:18:03.712\nIt's all touchscreen.\n\n293\n00:18:03.712 --> 00:18:06.853\nAnyone that's running an Android device\nright now should look at that and go,\n\n294\n00:18:06.853 --> 00:18:08.620\nI know how to get around that no problem.\n\n295\n00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:13.370\nI see that little row of dots there in the\nmiddle on the right-hand side, click that,\n\n296\n00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:15.660\nthat shows me the main application page.\n\n297\n00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.300\nSo simple like that.\n\n298\n00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.340\nI think even if I unlock device in here.\n\n299\n00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:26.660\nSo what I'm gonna show here\nis this is my device and\n\n300\n00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.000\nwe'll give you a closer look at it.\n\n301\n00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.130\nThis is just to give you a quick overview\ncuz we are gonna be working more closely\n\n302\n00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.000\nwith Kali NetHunter.\n\n303\n00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.522\nSo don't sit there and\nsay, I can't see that.\n\n304\n00:18:34.522 --> 00:18:37.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Get some glasses, eat some carrots.\n\n305\n00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.620\nAll right, so you can see it looks\nlike a typical Android device.\n\n306\n00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.390\nI can hit the little dots at the bottom.\n\n307\n00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:47.000\nAnd I have you know trays, or\nI have pages and pages of applications.\n\n308\n00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.400\nAnd, yes, most of these are used for\npen testing and security work and\n\n309\n00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.500\nstuff like that.\n\n310\n00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.225\nSecurity work.\n\n311\n00:18:52.225 --> 00:18:54.417\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I call it stalking.\n\n312\n00:18:54.417 --> 00:18:56.630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, but yeah you've got pages and\n\n313\n00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:00.600\npages of this stuff in here that\nI've just gone ahead and installed.\n\n314\n00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.640\nIt works and acts just like\na regular Android device, and\n\n315\n00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.940\nthat's the really neat thing in there.\n\n316\n00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.480\nYes, there are some things that when\nyou click on them they're gonna open up\n\n317\n00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.105\na terminal.\n\n318\n00:19:10.105 --> 00:19:13.690\nAnd in which case you're gonna get that\nlittle terminal interface that you have\n\n319\n00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:18.490\nto go through, and start typing stuff in.\n\n320\n00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:23.570\nAnd that's where we're gonna wanna start\nadjusting your text on your screen.\n\n321\n00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:26.740\nBut it's a familiar experience,\nit's easy to navigate.\n\n322\n00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.790\nYou know that's probably\nthe biggest thing.\n\n323\n00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.298\nBut the NetHunter interface, the really\ncool thing about it is, is that,\n\n324\n00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:36.090\nlike I said,\nif you've used an Android device,\n\n325\n00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:40.090\nthere's really not much to learn\nthere as far as getting around.\n\n326\n00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:42.940\nThe things you have to learn\nare how do those tools work?\n\n327\n00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.900\nAnd all the tools are well documented.\n\n328\n00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.670\nMost of the tools you're gonna see that\nare in Kali, are gonna be the same ones\n\n329\n00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:53.920\nthat you've seen not in Kali NetHunter,\nthe ones you've seen in Kali already.\n\n330\n00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.330\nIt just may be doing little\nthings here and there.\n\n331\n00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:02.238\nSome of the stuff, you do have to have\nyour actual adapters plugged in for\n\n332\n00:20:02.238 --> 00:20:04.210\nthem to work properly,\nbecause they will sit there and\n\n333\n00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.810\nfreak out if the adapters aren't there.\n\n334\n00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:09.160\nIt will try to sweep all the interfaces\nfor your system and going, hey,\n\n335\n00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.770\nthere's no adapter here,\nI can't do anything.\n\n336\n00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:12.720\nWhoa, we're done, what's going on?\n\n337\n00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.440\nBut if you have those plugged in,\nit should work just fine.\n\n338\n00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.620\n>> Nice.\nIt kinda does change the game a little\n\n339\n00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.310\nbit, though, with the power that you can\nget on one of these mobile devices now.\n\n340\n00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:26.370\nAnd running something like Kali NetHunter,\nI think Roberto in the chat\n\n341\n00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:31.350\nroom mentioned, who had a guy in his\nserver closet, a tech, charging his phone.\n\n342\n00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.275\nAre you sure that's what he's doing,\nright?\n\n343\n00:20:33.275 --> 00:20:34.716\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now you've really gotta be careful and\n\n344\n00:20:34.716 --> 00:20:35.930\ndouble check things.\n\n345\n00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:40.420\n>> Yeah, you can't be asleep at\nthe wheel with this type of thing.\n\n346\n00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.930\nWith these types of devices,\nyou think of something like this,\n\n347\n00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:48.590\nI've modified this enough that I\ncan even plug this thing in and\n\n348\n00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:52.120\nboot any computer I want off\nof it that boots off USB.\n\n349\n00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.350\nIt will show up like just\na regular flash drive.\n\n350\n00:20:54.350 --> 00:21:00.160\nAnd it's got multiple distros of Linux\nalready built on or stored on it.\n\n351\n00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:07.600\nSo I've got a customized distro of\nOphcrack, the password cracker.\n\n352\n00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.249\nSo all I gotta do is go to your\nWindows box, get my Micro-USB cable,\n\n353\n00:21:11.249 --> 00:21:15.610\nwhich I gotta have for me for\ncharging anyway, just like I said.\n\n354\n00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:20.430\nPlug it in, pop it in, and\njust let the computer be booted off that.\n\n355\n00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:24.670\nLoad that ISO file, and\nlet the games begin, you can do that.\n\n356\n00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:30.270\nI can load full-blown Kali off of this and\nrun it as a live distro.\n\n357\n00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:34.670\nI can run a boot to, heck if I want to,\nthe possibilities there.\n\n358\n00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:37.200\nI can run a copy of Windows,\n\n359\n00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.344\nI could create a bootable copy of\nWindows as an ISO and load it on there.\n\n360\n00:21:40.344 --> 00:21:41.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I would never torture my\n\n361\n00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:46.020\ndevice like that, but\nyou could definitely do that.\n\n362\n00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:51.630\nSo, it leads to some extremely\ninteresting capabilities\n\n363\n00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:56.100\nthat you're gonna get with NetHunter.\n\n364\n00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.960\nAs far as putting it on devices,\nthat's something\n\n365\n00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:05.660\nthat we have coming up in a later episode,\nso\n\n366\n00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:09.559\nif you've never done that you're\ngonna see what that looks like.\n\n367\n00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:16.050\nOne of the big things that you're\ngonna have is it's not the same as\n\n368\n00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:18.020\njust loading stock Kali.\n\n369\n00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:18.960\nLoading stock Kali,\n\n370\n00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:23.400\nwhen you get down to it,\nyou can just pop a flash drive, right?.\n\n371\n00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.390\nBoot off this, and\ninstall it off that, and you're done.\n\n372\n00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:31.740\nBut you can't do that the same\nway with an Android device.\n\n373\n00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:35.080\nThere's things that have to happen,\nwhich we're gonna talk about.\n\n374\n00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.180\nNo matter what Android device you have,\nthere's things that have to be done.\n\n375\n00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:42.560\nAnd if they're not done, the installation\nwill fail, and it will tick you off, and\n\n376\n00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.180\neverything else until you\nknow what you did wrong.\n\n377\n00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.090\nFortunately, we're here to\nhelp you with that, and\n\n378\n00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:52.570\nyou'll see how to do it, and there's also\na lot of documentation on that, too.\n\n379\n00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:56.717\nBut I'll tell you, if you don't\ninstall stuff on Android correctly,\n\n380\n00:22:56.717 --> 00:22:59.910\nyou can end up with a lot of frustration,\nlot of tears.\n\n381\n00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:00.549\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n382\n00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:04.690\nin some cases even a permanently\nbricked device, which you don't want.\n\n383\n00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:09.360\nSo we're gonna avoid that by\nshowing you how it's done.\n\n384\n00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.950\n>> So you guys thought Sean was\nhairless because of a personal choice,\n\n385\n00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:16.790\nit's because he's done all\nthe research installing this stuff for\n\n386\n00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.672\nus, and now we can just learn from him.\n\n387\n00:23:18.672 --> 00:23:19.460\n[LAUGH].\n\n388\n00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:20.724\n>> I'm a Shaolin monk on the weekends.\n\n389\n00:23:20.724 --> 00:23:21.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n390\n00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:23.241\n>> All right, well, Sean,\n\n391\n00:23:23.241 --> 00:23:25.290\na lot of great stuff there.\n\n392\n00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:30.110\nLooking forward to seeing both Kali and\nKali NetHunter live in action,\n\n393\n00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:32.880\nwhich we've got coming up, so\nmake sure you guys stay tuned.\n\n394\n00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.590\nBut for this episode, we are out of time.\n\n395\n00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:38.540\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n396\n00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:39.433\n>> And I'm Sean

00:00:17.000\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.380\nAnd in this episode, Sean, we're gonna\nbe taking a look at installing Kali.\n\n5\n00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.180\nWe've talked about the new\nversion of Kali that's out, 2.0,\n\n6\n00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.580\ntalked a little bit about Kali NetHunter.\n\n7\n00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.660\nNow we wanna go back, focus on Kali 2.0,\nand take a look at the different ways we\n\n8\n00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.960\ncan install it, and\nactually do an installation for you.\n\n9\n00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.640\nSo Sean, show us how we do it.\n\n10\n00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.200\n>> All right, so what we're gonna do\nhere is we're gonna install Kali 2.0.\n\n11\n00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.079\nAnd we're gonna be installing\ninto a virtual environment,\n\n12\n00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.061\nthis virtual environment being VMware.\n\n13\n00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:53.520\nBut you can choose your weapon of choice,\nwhatever that might be for virtualization.\n\n14\n00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.520\nSo the idea here is to get\nit into that environment.\n\n15\n00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.190\nNow, just for the record, this is mainly\nto show you what the installation\n\n16\n00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.970\nprocess looks like, and\nalso discuss some of the issues.\n\n17\n00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.023\nIf you really, truly want a virtual\nimage and run it that way,\n\n18\n00:01:08.023 --> 00:01:10.571\nthere's even an easier way\nto get a virtual image.\n\n19\n00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:14.790\nAnd that's just to download a virtual\nimage from the offensive security site for\n\n20\n00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.710\nKali and you're ready to go.\n\n21\n00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.890\nBut we're gonna use this as more of\na demo of how to do the installation,\n\n22\n00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.570\nrather than we're gonna focus on\nsomething as, hey we're specifically\n\n23\n00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.520\ncreating a virtual image for the purpose\nof creating a virtual image for later.\n\n24\n00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.710\nSo, the way things are gonna work is I\nhave already downloaded the ISO file for\n\n25\n00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.920\nus of Kali 2.0.\n\n26\n00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.280\nI downloaded it before we got\nstarted today to make sure I had\n\n27\n00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.740\nthe freshest of the fresh.\n\n28\n00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.759\nSo I've got that.\n\n29\n00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.720\nAnd what I've done here on my computer is\nI have set it up so I have VMware running.\n\n30\n00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.120\nSo you can see I have VMware and\n\n31\n00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.370\nI'm going through the process of\ncreating a new virtual machine.\n\n32\n00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.310\nWhen I create a new virtual machine,\n\n33\n00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.380\nwhat's gonna happen is I'm\ngonna choose my Kali ISO file.\n\n34\n00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.049\nClick Next,\nit asks me what operating system it is.\n\n35\n00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.937\nAnd you could choose Ubuntu but\nyou can also choose a version of\n\n36\n00:02:14.937 --> 00:02:19.355\nDebian if you want cuz this\nis a Debian-based product,\n\n37\n00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:23.210\nas we were talking about\nin our initial segment.\n\n38\n00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.537\nSo you could say Debian 7,\n64-bit if you want.\n\n39\n00:02:29.537 --> 00:02:34.058\nAnd then just name it,\nI'll name mine Kali2.0,\n\n40\n00:02:34.058 --> 00:02:39.730\nsince I already have a virtual\nmachine over there called Kali 2.\n\n41\n00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.020\nI'll just keep that Kali2.0\nto make it easy, click Next.\n\n42\n00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.750\nHere's some things that\nyou wanna think about.\n\n43\n00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.733\nI like to, when I install this,\n\n44\n00:02:49.733 --> 00:02:53.778\nI like to make sure that I'm keeping\neverything in a single file.\n\n45\n00:02:53.778 --> 00:02:56.460\nVMware will break into\nmultiple files by default.\n\n46\n00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.496\nAlso, just keep it in a single file and\nI typically will give\n\n47\n00:03:01.496 --> 00:03:06.654\nit 40 gigs of size cuz I just\nthink that works better for me.\n\n48\n00:03:06.654 --> 00:03:10.732\nI'm already planning ahead that I know\nI'm gonna install some other stuff and\n\n49\n00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:12.909\nthings like that in there so, 40 gigs.\n\n50\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.400\nAny customization of hardware?\n\n51\n00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.990\nYes, you should actually do this if you\nwant to get the most bang for your buck.\n\n52\n00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.605\nAnd what I wanna do for memory is, for\n\n53\n00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:30.449\nmemory you can run it on 512,\nyou can run it on 1024.\n\n54\n00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:35.256\nI am typically gonna be running this thing\non 2048 just to make sure everything's all\n\n55\n00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:38.090\nnice and safe, and\ndoing the way it's supposed to.\n\n56\n00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.420\nRemember, the memory requirements\nare higher for this.\n\n57\n00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.960\nI believe, if I remember off the top of\nmy head, the minimum requirements for\n\n58\n00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.190\nKali 2.0 would be 768,\nI believe is what they estimate it as.\n\n59\n00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.700\nNo, I'm not running it at 768,\njust put it that way.\n\n60\n00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.930\nSo [LAUGH] but you could do that.\n\n61\n00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.200\nI guess it's good to know that\nyou could do that if you want.\n\n62\n00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.920\nSo I'll just go ahead and say that looks\npretty good, and I will click Finish.\n\n63\n00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.388\nAnd you can see I have my\nvirtual machine ready to go.\n\n64\n00:04:12.388 --> 00:04:14.970\nSo, it's gonna power it on so\n\n65\n00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.330\nthis would look the same as it\nwould on a physical machine.\n\n66\n00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:25.000\nSo, what it brings up in here is it\nasks me how I want to install this.\n\n67\n00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.240\nNow, I can do it live,\n\n68\n00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.880\nwhich would be meaning I'm just gonna run\nit from the ISO file and not install it.\n\n69\n00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.230\nYou can run over USB or\nyou can do the installation.\n\n70\n00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.960\nI'm gonna do the installation option.\n\n71\n00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.760\nDepending on how you feel about things,\nyou can do the installation as\n\n72\n00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.060\nthe first install option there,\nthat is a text-based install.\n\n73\n00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.060\nSo if you really wanna do\na text-based install, go for it.\n\n74\n00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.520\nThat's the one I'm gonna choose.\n\n75\n00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.370\nIf you feel that you want to\nput on your training wheels and\n\n76\n00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.000\nget back in your highchair,\nyou can use a graphical install.\n\n77\n00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.939\nNot that I'm biased or picking on anybody.\n\n78\n00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:04.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It's all up to you.\n\n79\n00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.350\nI personally, in all seriousness,\nI like the first install,\n\n80\n00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.708\nthe text-based install just because,\ndepending on the system you're working on,\n\n81\n00:05:13.708 --> 00:05:17.368\nsometimes the graphical install,\nbecause of the extra overhead and\n\n82\n00:05:17.368 --> 00:05:20.839\nthe fact it's trying to use your mouse and\nstuff like that during it,\n\n83\n00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.620\nit may not recognize your drivers and\nstuff like that.\n\n84\n00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.560\nSo the graphical install will still\ndisplay, but if you're expecting\n\n85\n00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.920\nto be able to click on stuff and type it\nin, you may not be able to do that anyway.\n\n86\n00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.870\nI know the text-based install's gonna\nwork so, and it's easy enough to follow.\n\n87\n00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.350\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead and\nI've got my install chosen.\n\n88\n00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.100\nHit Enter on that so\nit's gonna load that up.\n\n89\n00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.720\nNow, it goes through its whole deal\nof loading the basic Bootstrap stuff.\n\n90\n00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.695\nAnd so it's coming up, and it says okay,\njust the typical stuff, what language?\n\n91\n00:05:55.695 --> 00:06:00.115\nWell, English,\ncuz that's the only language I know.\n\n92\n00:06:00.115 --> 00:06:05.237\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So then I'm gonna use, it's gonna be\n\n93\n00:06:05.237 --> 00:06:11.457\nUS for location, American English,\ncuz we speak American.\n\n94\n00:06:11.457 --> 00:06:15.312\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I'm being topical,\n\n95\n00:06:15.312 --> 00:06:17.482\nI'm picking on people on the news.\n\n96\n00:06:17.482 --> 00:06:22.213\nSo you can see in here it's loading\nin some stuff in the background to\n\n97\n00:06:22.213 --> 00:06:26.700\nhelp it with the setup, read packages,\nset up the file system.\n\n98\n00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.470\nThat's what's actually happening here.\n\n99\n00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.450\nSo, you'll notice it's\npretty straightforward so\n\n100\n00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.385\nfar, and that's a good thing.\n\n101\n00:06:36.385 --> 00:06:41.520\nThat really a good thing that it's pretty\nstraightforward and simple for us so far.\n\n102\n00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.560\nBut there are some potential\ngotcha's in there.\n\n103\n00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:51.320\nI will, the host name,\nI'll leave it as Kali for right now.\n\n104\n00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.320\nYou could put in whatever you want,\nso I'll do that.\n\n105\n00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.620\nDomain name,\nI'm not gonna put a domain name in.\n\n106\n00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.460\nSo password,\nit's gonna ask you to set a root password.\n\n107\n00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:09.910\nYou can choose to set that now or\nyou can choose to set it once you get in.\n\n108\n00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:14.600\nI can just go ahead in here and\nI'll say my password.\n\n109\n00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.590\nI'll just set a standard password.\n\n110\n00:07:20.761 --> 00:07:23.408\nAnd to make sure I got it, asks me again.\n\n111\n00:07:26.067 --> 00:07:28.220\nSo, still going pretty good.\n\n112\n00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.522\nTime zone, no I refuse to recognize I'm\non the East Coast, so I'm doing Pacific.\n\n113\n00:07:33.522 --> 00:07:37.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] But anyway, so there you are,\n\n114\n00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.360\nso the install continues.\n\n115\n00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.270\nOkay, these are things that you're\ngonna want to pay attention to,\n\n116\n00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.930\nis how it's gonna use\nthe actual disk in here.\n\n117\n00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.975\nI tell it to go ahead and\nuse the entire disk.\n\n118\n00:07:51.975 --> 00:07:56.224\nAnd if you have, this is the only\nthing on here in this virtual system,\n\n119\n00:07:56.224 --> 00:07:59.466\nit's the only thing in this\nvirtual environment, So\n\n120\n00:07:59.466 --> 00:08:05.000\nit will use the entire disk however it\nsees fit, it picks up the disk, great.\n\n121\n00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.060\nAnd so I'm just gonna accept the defaults\nand say, leave them all in one partition.\n\n122\n00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.640\nThrow all the stuff in one thing,\nkeep it simple.\n\n123\n00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.260\nAnd I know some people will\nargue with me and say,\n\n124\n00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.350\nwell I like to partition up my drive and\ndo all this good stuff with it.\n\n125\n00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.440\nFine, I don't care.\n\n126\n00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.740\nDo whatever you want.\n\n127\n00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.542\nYou're free to be wrong.\n\n128\n00:08:25.542 --> 00:08:30.461\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In all seriousness you can choose it\n\n129\n00:08:30.461 --> 00:08:32.965\nto setup however you want.\n\n130\n00:08:32.965 --> 00:08:36.155\nI've had that argument of\nshould I use the default,\n\n131\n00:08:36.155 --> 00:08:40.915\nput everything in one partition, or\nshould I split it up across partitions?\n\n132\n00:08:42.045 --> 00:08:43.195\nYes.\n\n133\n00:08:43.195 --> 00:08:44.855\nThat's the answer.\nYes.\n\n134\n00:08:44.855 --> 00:08:48.645\nWhatever you feel suits you and\nmakes it work better for you.\n\n135\n00:08:48.645 --> 00:08:49.885\nDo that.\n\n136\n00:08:49.885 --> 00:08:53.740\nI'm not, and, I just prefer to\nkeep it at the defaults for\n\n137\n00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.860\nthe installation wherever possible because\nit's easy to determine what I did.\n\n138\n00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.370\nAnd as far as I'm concerned for\n\n139\n00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.610\nwhat I'm doing there's no reason to\nchange all sorts of things, you know.\n\n140\n00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:07.370\nSo you make your own decision for\nwhat's appropriate.\n\n141\n00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:11.940\nSo once you've decided that this setup's\nthe way you want, just say finish and\n\n142\n00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.879\nwrite the changes.\n\n143\n00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.900\nAnd notice it will confirm if you wanna\nwrite the changes for virtual environment\n\n144\n00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.240\nthat's blank, I don't care I'm just\ngonna say yeah go ahead and write them.\n\n145\n00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.270\nIf this was a physical machine\nthat you're doing this,\n\n146\n00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.630\nyou'd better make sure that\nthis is 100% correct and\n\n147\n00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:34.630\nhow you want it because if you write\nthese changes to it and you're like oops.\n\n148\n00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.380\nWell you're probably gonna be watching\nthat forensics course that Mike and\n\n149\n00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.746\nI did quite a few times to get all\nthe stuff back that she just blew away.\n\n150\n00:09:41.746 --> 00:09:43.829\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n151\n00:09:43.829 --> 00:09:44.990\n>> So, anyway.\n\n152\n00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:48.690\nAnd if you do that, let us know, because\nwe're gonna charge you to watch it.\n\n153\n00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.244\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, anyway.\n\n154\n00:09:51.244 --> 00:09:53.548\nSo we have, write the changes to the disk.\n\n155\n00:09:53.548 --> 00:09:54.650\nYes, of course.\n\n156\n00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.250\nIt goes ahead and does that.\n\n157\n00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:01.810\nYou can see it's actually\nfairly simple install, but\n\n158\n00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.350\nthere are some things that\ncan possibly come up.\n\n159\n00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.130\nWhy it's doing this.\n\n160\n00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:10.240\nOne of the things that has been reported\nwhen people have gone from one to two\n\n161\n00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.980\nis they've had various errors come up.\n\n162\n00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.585\nAlways if you start getting errors in\ninstallation of after you've installed\n\n163\n00:10:17.585 --> 00:10:19.878\nKali 2.0 and\ncertain things aren't working or\n\n164\n00:10:19.878 --> 00:10:22.132\ncertain options aren't\nappearing in Windows.\n\n165\n00:10:22.132 --> 00:10:26.890\nMaybe you should Google what those\nerrors are cuz a lot of them have been,\n\n166\n00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:32.100\nthat I've seen so far, haven't been\nfrom an error in Kali specifically.\n\n167\n00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:36.610\nIt's been from someone taking one and\nupgrading to two.\n\n168\n00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:39.595\nAnd they carried some of\nthose artifacts over.\n\n169\n00:10:39.595 --> 00:10:40.520\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n170\n00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.960\n>> And it just caused problems.\n\n171\n00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.430\nSo the fix was to just\ncompletely blow the stuff away.\n\n172\n00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:50.640\nAnd start from completely clean\nfrom scratch, which I mean come on.\n\n173\n00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.870\nIsn't they'd even say at\nthe Windows world, don't upgrade.\n\n174\n00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.750\nYou go there, blow the stuff.\n\n175\n00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.730\nWe'll back it up, blow it away.\n\n176\n00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:56.810\nAnd we'll put a new version on.\n\n177\n00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:57.930\n>> Always a better option.\n\n178\n00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.230\nBut is there an upgrade path,\n\n179\n00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:03.230\nif I had 1.0 installed on here I could\nupgrade instead of doing a clean?\n\n180\n00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:04.670\n>> Yeah, you can do it.\n\n181\n00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:08.170\nAnd that's documented, but\nI don't know if I would really do it.\n\n182\n00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.390\nYou can see, I'm not even really\ntalking about it in here cuz I'll leave\n\n183\n00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.310\nthat up to you.\n\n184\n00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:14.870\nIf that's a path you want to take,\ngo ahead and do it.\n\n185\n00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.880\nI've seen that it's really not worth it.\n\n186\n00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:22.110\nYou're just asking for\nproblems if you do it that way.\n\n187\n00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:28.100\nI've always myself I've always copied\nall my data off and just blasted it and\n\n188\n00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.720\nput the new stuff in and then copied\nback or reinstalled as appropriate.\n\n189\n00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.510\nBut be very,\nvery careful if you install it over,\n\n190\n00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.320\nif you're trying to preserve your\nprevious settings and try, and\n\n191\n00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:45.000\nyou bring two over one and\nyou start getting these weird errors.\n\n192\n00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.560\nSome of these errors you\ncan diagnose them for\n\n193\n00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:52.020\na while before you find out that oops,\nthat is an upgrade problem.\n\n194\n00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.940\nI have seen people have problems for\nexample with their wireless.\n\n195\n00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.600\nWhere they had there wireless\nwasn't working correctly.\n\n196\n00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.890\nThey were trying to turn it on and\nthey couldn't do anything.\n\n197\n00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.960\nAnd they were checking drivers and\na whole bunch of other stuff and\n\n198\n00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.260\nit just wasn't working.\n\n199\n00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.860\nOnly to find out that yeah that was\none stuff conflicting with two and\n\n200\n00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.160\nthere was some configuration\nfiles fighting between the two.\n\n201\n00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.740\nIt didn't know which one to read.\n\n202\n00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:20.901\nAnd it can be incredibly irritating if you\never have to go through that scenario.\n\n203\n00:12:20.901 --> 00:12:22.887\n>> So avoid the upgrade if you can.\n\n204\n00:12:22.887 --> 00:12:23.745\n>> Yeah.\n\n205\n00:12:23.745 --> 00:12:27.453\n>> And honestly when you install Kali\ntypically you're not storing a lot of\n\n206\n00:12:27.453 --> 00:12:28.679\nstuff on that machine.\n\n207\n00:12:28.679 --> 00:12:32.045\nProbably better to do just a clean\ninstall like we talked about.\n\n208\n00:12:32.045 --> 00:12:34.124\nYeah, that's kind of my policy.\n\n209\n00:12:34.124 --> 00:12:39.623\nNow one of the things that we'll do, and\nthis is where the stuff we have coming\n\n210\n00:12:39.623 --> 00:12:44.781\nlater on with this kind of fits in\nthe mix, is what about those people that\n\n211\n00:12:44.781 --> 00:12:49.797\nhave gone through and spent the time\nto customize their environment.\n\n212\n00:12:49.797 --> 00:12:52.706\nAnd they're like, well I don't want to\nblow this stuff away, it took me so\n\n213\n00:12:52.706 --> 00:12:54.197\nlong to customize that environment.\n\n214\n00:12:54.197 --> 00:12:58.406\nWell if that's the case and you customized\nyour environment with your own special\n\n215\n00:12:58.406 --> 00:13:02.382\ntools and what have you, you've\ncustomized the wall paper, I don't know.\n\n216\n00:13:02.382 --> 00:13:08.000\nYou've done all the above and\nyou want to preserve that environment.\n\n217\n00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.080\nIf that's the case you've got an option.\n\n218\n00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:15.110\nWhat you can do is you can\njust set up the environment.\n\n219\n00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.170\nYou have to do some planning.\n\n220\n00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:22.360\nBut make a brand new install, set up\nthe environment the way you want it,\n\n221\n00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.560\nwith all the whatevers in it.\n\n222\n00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.920\nAnd then you can actually create\nyour own custom ISO of Kali.\n\n223\n00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.740\nSo you can take all your tools and\nall your configuration settings,\n\n224\n00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.450\nshove them inside the Kali and\n\n225\n00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.960\nthen make your own version of that and\nthen you've got your own ISO.\n\n226\n00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.400\nSo you could just blow the thing away left\nand right, and as long as you copied your\n\n227\n00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.730\ndata off, you could reinstall\nthat ISO with all your tools and\n\n228\n00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.820\nyou're right back to where you go.\n\n229\n00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:51.360\nGiven you that ability to do that, you can\nactually do it with NetHunter as well.\n\n230\n00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.380\nWhich I think is another pretty awesome\nthing, so if you go through with\n\n231\n00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.725\nNetHunter and you build your own\ncustom environment with all the tools.\n\n232\n00:13:58.725 --> 00:14:01.735\nThat you like, and\nyou're really happy with it, fine!\n\n233\n00:14:01.735 --> 00:14:04.095\nJust make a note of all the tools\nyou have that you've tested and\n\n234\n00:14:04.095 --> 00:14:08.185\nyou like, then build a custom environment\nwith all that stuff on there and\n\n235\n00:14:08.185 --> 00:14:11.665\nthen build a custom\nKali NetHunter image and save it.\n\n236\n00:14:11.665 --> 00:14:13.925\nYou can just load that thing over and\nover again and\n\n237\n00:14:13.925 --> 00:14:17.910\nbe right back to where you are, which\nis ideally where you'd wanna be anyway,\n\n238\n00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:22.530\nbecause if I do pen testing with\nthe Kali environment, well, any system.\n\n239\n00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:26.976\nBut if we just focus on Kali,\ndo pen testing with a Kali environment,\n\n240\n00:14:26.976 --> 00:14:32.357\nafter I'm done pen testing against that\nclient, for the best amount of security.\n\n241\n00:14:32.357 --> 00:14:33.645\nI'm just gonna go and\n\n242\n00:14:33.645 --> 00:14:38.265\nblow that system away and\nthen reinstall my environment on there.\n\n243\n00:14:38.265 --> 00:14:39.355\nI've been known to do that.\n\n244\n00:14:39.355 --> 00:14:41.715\nOnce I start scanning stuff and\n\n245\n00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:45.810\ndoing whatever on my reconnaissance and\nprobes against it.\n\n246\n00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:50.550\nJust to make sure that I don't mix and\nmatch stuff between one client and\n\n247\n00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:55.660\nanother, or\nnothing gets carried from one to wherever,\n\n248\n00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:59.620\nI will just go through and wipe the drive,\nand then reinstall the stuff on there.\n\n249\n00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:03.020\nAnd that way I have\ncompletely clean system.\n\n250\n00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:03.830\nIf it's ever asked,\n\n251\n00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:09.030\nlike, did you clean that system, or this\ndoesn't look like our stuff, are you sure.\n\n252\n00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.380\nYeah I wiped that system every time.\n\n253\n00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.860\n>> Yeah I would almost think that\nit's a must, you don't want to\n\n254\n00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:18.650\ngenerate a report for a new client and\nhave some history from the other\n\n255\n00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:22.880\nclient on there you've got India, or none\ndisclosure sign and all that anyway so.\n\n256\n00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.460\nProbably a very important step is to purge\neverything and, heck if I can create my\n\n257\n00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:31.390\nown ISO with my own customized way I\nwant it, the layout that's perfect.\n\n258\n00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:33.794\n>> Yeah it's not exactly\n100% easy to create one.\n\n259\n00:15:33.794 --> 00:15:35.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, you know, we're gonna,\n\n260\n00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.200\nwe're gonna walk you through that.\n\n261\n00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.602\nIt's not, it's not 100% easy but\nit's not extremely difficult either.\n\n262\n00:15:41.602 --> 00:15:44.977\nYou'll find, for those who've had\nto script and installation or\n\n263\n00:15:44.977 --> 00:15:46.489\ncreate an image for Windows.\n\n264\n00:15:46.489 --> 00:15:49.932\nYou'll find that if you ignore Windows and\nMicrosoft and\n\n265\n00:15:49.932 --> 00:15:54.378\njust focus on the process, meaning\nif you ignore Windows and Microsoft,\n\n266\n00:15:54.378 --> 00:15:58.846\nyou're not looking at That specific\nvender, that specific situation.\n\n267\n00:15:58.846 --> 00:16:02.224\nIf you just say, okay, well,\ntake those labels off of it and\n\n268\n00:16:02.224 --> 00:16:03.831\njust look at how I do things?\n\n269\n00:16:03.831 --> 00:16:07.296\nThe names may be different, but we have,\n\n270\n00:16:07.296 --> 00:16:12.247\nlike in Linux,\nwe have something called a precede filing.\n\n271\n00:16:12.247 --> 00:16:14.769\nWell, precede, what's that?\nWell, that's the answer file we use in\n\n272\n00:16:14.769 --> 00:16:19.606\nWindows, so they're just using the same\nstuff you're already familiar with, so\n\n273\n00:16:19.606 --> 00:16:23.753\nyou could actually pull those skills and\ncapabilities right on over and\n\n274\n00:16:23.753 --> 00:16:25.390\nbuild your own custom ISO.\n\n275\n00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.640\nWe're going to walk you through that,\n\n276\n00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:32.600\njust to make sure you're familiar with\nit and can do it if you so choose.\n\n277\n00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:39.560\nAnyway, see that clever\nmisdirection there we did so\n\n278\n00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:43.295\nyou'd have to watch the install?\n\n279\n00:16:43.295 --> 00:16:44.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anyway, so\n\n280\n00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.590\nwhat I have here is the install,\neverything's gotten copied over,\n\n281\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:51.940\nit's saying do you want to use\nthe network mirror with it.\n\n282\n00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.200\nThe network mirror,\nthe reason it's asking about this,\n\n283\n00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.590\nis saying if you have internet\naccess when you're doing this,\n\n284\n00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:02.810\nif using the network mirror, it's going\nto say, well you downloaded this,\n\n285\n00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:07.380\nthere may very well be some newer\nstuff that wasn't in that image.\n\n286\n00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.300\nYou know,\nbecause we don't post those ISOs everyday.\n\n287\n00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.360\nEven though I took the liberty of\n\n288\n00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.840\ndownloading the newest ISO this morning,\nthere is nothing saying that ISO had not\n\n289\n00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.510\nbeen sitting up there in that state for\na month.\n\n290\n00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:23.660\nYou know so in any case they are saying do\nyou want to connect to the mirror to see,\n\n291\n00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:27.140\nhey what is the difference between\nwhat you have and what is available?\n\n292\n00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.930\nYeah sure, why not if you network access,\nlet's it do it.\n\n293\n00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:34.050\nIf you a proxy, pop it in.\n\n294\n00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:36.250\nIt'll go ahead and do a quick scan.\n\n295\n00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.140\nYou can see it's actually\nretrieving some stuff.\n\n296\n00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:44.500\nIt says it found some stuff up there that\nit may think that are things that I need.\n\n297\n00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:48.230\nSo, that's kind of a cool thing, so\nI'm getting an up to date install.\n\n298\n00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:53.250\nIf you, and I have had this happen when\nI've done an installation like this,\n\n299\n00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.490\nI've done an installation of Kali and it\nsays do you want to use a network mirror?\n\n300\n00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:58.810\nAnd you're like yeah, sure.\n\n301\n00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:00.140\nIt says do you want to use reoccuring?\n\n302\n00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.090\nSure.\n\n303\n00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.900\nWell it won't connect to it,\nit keeps failing.\n\n304\n00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:08.110\nIf that's the case, just go ahead and\nsay no I don't want to connect to it,\n\n305\n00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:11.810\nproceed with the install, and then do it\nafter you've configured your wireless or\n\n306\n00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.340\nwhatever was the problem,\nif you figure out what that is.\n\n307\n00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.410\nYou can go back and\nresolve that problem, and\n\n308\n00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:19.880\nthen do the updates to make sure\nyou're getting the latest stuff.\n\n309\n00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.790\nSo you're not up the creek,\nit's just there's a benefit\n\n310\n00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:26.260\nif you do it here because you can\ntake care of it all in one shot,\n\n311\n00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:31.505\nit just means you have an extra\npost-installation task to potentially do.\n\n312\n00:18:32.655 --> 00:18:34.755\n>> Sometimes it can be tricky\nif you're doing it in a VM,\n\n313\n00:18:34.755 --> 00:18:37.835\ntrying to get that VM internet access\nbefore you've got it installed\n\n314\n00:18:37.835 --> 00:18:40.400\nand configured and things like that, so\n>> Because that's typically what\n\n315\n00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.210\nthe problem is, right?\n\n316\n00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:45.564\nIf I can't get Internet access to whatever\nit is I'm installing it on, it's not gonna\n\n317\n00:18:45.564 --> 00:18:49.501\nbe able to reach out to that mirror and\nsee if there's any updated setup files or\n\n318\n00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:53.106\nanything like that that weren't\nincluded in iSO that it can download.\n\n319\n00:18:53.106 --> 00:18:56.120\nBut as you say we can always\ndo some of that post, right?\n\n320\n00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.820\n>> Yeah, and that's the good thing.\n\n321\n00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.790\nOkay?\nNow, this is an important part right here.\n\n322\n00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:05.590\nIt says, do you want to install\nthe boot loader for it?\n\n323\n00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:09.870\nOkay, this is where doing your research\nand paying attention is going to be handy.\n\n324\n00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:14.474\nIf you tell it don't install the boot\nloader, I hope you've got a subscription\n\n325\n00:19:14.474 --> 00:19:18.845\nto ITPro, because you're gonna be\nwatching us again on how to install it.\n\n326\n00:19:18.845 --> 00:19:19.578\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And,\n\n327\n00:19:19.578 --> 00:19:24.130\nyou're gonna pause on the place where I\nsay, you need to install the boot loader.\n\n328\n00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.940\nBecause, without the boot loader,\nthe system just ain't gonna boot.\n\n329\n00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.050\nThe only reason you wouldn't install\na boot loader is if you already had one,\n\n330\n00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.630\nyou wanted to make a modification\nto that manually or whatever.\n\n331\n00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:34.690\nThen you could do that.\n\n332\n00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.240\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> This way, I'm gonna say, it says,\n\n333\n00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.738\ninstall the GRUB boot loader to MBR?\n\n334\n00:19:38.738 --> 00:19:40.720\nYeah, go ahead and do that.\n\n335\n00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.680\nIt's like where's it gonna install it?\n\n336\n00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:48.280\nI only have one drive in here, so\nI'm gonna install it to that drive.\n\n337\n00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.080\nIt's gonna install that boot loader,\nit should only take a moment or two.\n\n338\n00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:56.339\nAnd so, it just kinda goes through and\ncleans up after itself and\n\n339\n00:19:56.339 --> 00:19:57.670\ndoes all that stuff.\n\n340\n00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:01.340\nAnd we should be, after it's done with\nthis, it should be ready to just kind of\n\n341\n00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:08.610\ngo ahead and reboot and be back to\npresenting us with the Kali interface.\n\n342\n00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:12.540\nSo it does take a little time,\ndoing this, but.\n\n343\n00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:18.040\nSo it says hey, it finished it,\nso go ahead and continue.\n\n344\n00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.561\nSo it's going though, doing its job.\n\n345\n00:20:22.561 --> 00:20:27.210\nSo we're gonna have a nice\nnew Kali system to play with.\n\n346\n00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:28.981\nSo, gotta love it.\n\n347\n00:20:28.981 --> 00:20:33.539\nNow, if you did a live install, a live\ninstall is just gonna run it off a flash\n\n348\n00:20:33.539 --> 00:20:38.384\ndevice, and so you won't go through all\nthis, but do remember, if you run a live\n\n349\n00:20:38.384 --> 00:20:43.115\ninstall, it is loading stuff off all of\nthis, so there's going to be a delay.\n\n350\n00:20:43.115 --> 00:20:47.245\nWhen you click on menus and stuff like\nthat you'll see like, click, and then.\n\n351\n00:20:47.245 --> 00:20:49.490\nOkay, it's going to happen eventually,\nright?\n\n352\n00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:55.630\nIt'll remind you of Windows 10.\n\n353\n00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:01.800\nIn all seriousness, it's has to go over,\nbut off the flash drive,\n\n354\n00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:07.460\nthere's going to be a delay, but it's\na good way to test it out, but that's it.\n\n355\n00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:11.290\nThere is a forensics mode,\nwhich we're going to talk about.\n\n356\n00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:15.960\nThere's a forensics mode in here that\ndoes load from a flash device or\n\n357\n00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.460\nsomething like that, and it has to\nbecause it makes the drive on the system,\n\n358\n00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.830\nthe host drive read-only, so\nit won't make changes to it, so\n\n359\n00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.240\nyou can do forensic analysis,\nwhich is what we want.\n\n360\n00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.030\nThe performance isn't the issue there,\nit's getting it right and\n\n361\n00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:30.430\nlegally permissible.\n\n362\n00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:35.500\nThat is the issue, so I don't care about\ndoing it with the flash drive like that.\n\n363\n00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:41.150\nAt this point,\nonce everything's kind of squared away and\n\n364\n00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:47.670\nall that, we will have our Kali install,\nand you can just go ahead.\n\n365\n00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:53.510\nSo mine's just rebooting right here,\nand going right in.\n\n366\n00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:59.186\nSo it's doing its loading,\nlet's see if we were successful.\n\n367\n00:21:59.186 --> 00:22:02.150\n>> [LAUGH] Drumroll, please.\n\n368\n00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:05.480\n[LAUGH]\n>> I shouldn't say if we're successful.\n\n369\n00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.460\nIf we're not successful,\nyou guys will never know.\n\n370\n00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.638\nWe'll edit that out, so.\n\n371\n00:22:10.638 --> 00:22:11.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n372\n00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.900\n>> So username is going to be root,\n\n373\n00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.400\nsorry I go through, it's going to be root.\n\n374\n00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:22.370\nHit enter and\nI'll type my password in, and\n\n375\n00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:25.405\njust do a sign in and it gets me to,\n\n376\n00:22:25.405 --> 00:22:30.465\nit should get me after a quick kind\nof initial setup of the desktop,\n\n377\n00:22:30.465 --> 00:22:34.055\nI should have my Kali desktop,\nwhich is indeed what I have.\n\n378\n00:22:34.055 --> 00:22:37.497\nSo I now have a Kali system\nthat's ready to go ahead.\n\n379\n00:22:37.497 --> 00:22:41.067\nAt that point you would go start\ndoing your post-installation tasks,\n\n380\n00:22:41.067 --> 00:22:43.677\nwhatever that might be\nyou would take that on.\n\n381\n00:22:43.677 --> 00:22:49.127\nBut right now you can see I've\ngot a nice clean Kali desktop,\n\n382\n00:22:49.127 --> 00:22:51.168\nand it's ready to rock and roll.\n\n383\n00:22:51.168 --> 00:22:52.148\n>> Fantastic, Sean.\n\n384\n00:22:52.148 --> 00:22:53.358\nWell, there you go ladies and gentlemen.\n\n385\n00:22:53.358 --> 00:22:56.898\nWe just walked you through\nthe entire process of installing\n\n386\n00:22:56.898 --> 00:22:58.948\nKali Linux in a virtual machine.\n\n387\n00:22:58.948 --> 00:23:00.608\nAnd the installation process, Sean,\n\n388\n00:23:00.608 --> 00:23:03.650\ncorrect me if I'm wrong,\nwouldn't be any different if I was\n\n389\n00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:07.880\nputting this on a physical machine versus\na virtual machine, other than some things\n\n390\n00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:11.130\nI've got to do to the virtual to make it\nhave network access, but the wizards and\n\n391\n00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:13.542\neverything else are going to\nbe exactly the same right?\n\n392\n00:23:13.542 --> 00:23:15.990\n>> Yeah,\nthey're going to be exactly the same, so\n\n393\n00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:20.580\nno matter which virtualization software\nyou go, which hardware you go,\n\n394\n00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:24.990\nit's going to look the same, so that's the\ncool thing about it is that all the stuff\n\n395\n00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:27.990\nI just showed you is going to\ngo right across the board.\n\n396\n00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.120\nThe thing I would tell you\nto keep in mind, though,\n\n397\n00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:35.250\nis remember that little lecture I\nwas giving there, saying If you're,\n\n398\n00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.970\nif Kali one is involved at any point,\nyou have that living on that system,\n\n399\n00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:42.110\nbe careful if you're installing\ntwo on that same system,\n\n400\n00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:45.220\nbecause there are a series of\nknown hiccups and glitches and\n\n401\n00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:49.720\nstuff that doesn't even look like it has\nanything to do with the other versions\n\n402\n00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:54.820\nbeing somewhere, existing somewhere,\nthat can caused you to freak out.\n\n403\n00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:58.460\nLike I say, can you imagine, you had Kali\none on that system and installing two on\n\n404\n00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.500\nthere, and all of the sudden,\nyou're getting wireless problems, and\n\n405\n00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.580\nyou're like, you're trying to resolve all\nthese wireless issues and they won't go\n\n406\n00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.390\naway, no matter what you do only to find\nout it had nothing to do with wireless.\n\n407\n00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:12.620\nIt was something else that was doing\nit that you didn't even think of.\n\n408\n00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.250\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n409\n00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:16.300\nDo your research.\n\n410\n00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:22.040\nDon't sit here and think I'm the IT guy,\nI know everything and I'm the god of this.\n\n411\n00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:22.990\nNo.\nHey,\n\n412\n00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:24.700\ndo your research if you\ndo something on there.\n\n413\n00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:29.250\nPersonally, I don't have a reason\nto keep a Kali one system anymore.\n\n414\n00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:31.420\nOnce my data's out of it, it's gone.\n\n415\n00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.350\nI'm nooking it and\nI'm putting my new stuff on.\n\n416\n00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:36.150\n>> Clean install is always the way to go.\n\n417\n00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:37.250\nAlright.\nWell, ladies and gentleman,\n\n418\n00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:38.600\nwe're out of time for this episode.\n\n419\n00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:39.730\nHope you enjoyed watching.\n\n420\n00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.210\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n421\n00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:43.102\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n422\n00:24:43.102 --> 00:24:44.123\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n423\n00:24:44.123 --> 00:24:45.220\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.360\nI'm your host Mike Roderick,\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.890\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\ntaking a look at Kali Linux and\n\n5\n00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.370\nspecifically post installation tasks.\n\n6\n00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.090\nOnce we get it installed,\nwhat do we do next.\n\n7\n00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.460\nBefore we start diving in and\n\n8\n00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.960\nplaying with all the cool tools, there\nare some things, Sean that we can do to\n\n9\n00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.310\nkind of customize it to fit whatever\nwe're gonna be using it for.\n\n10\n00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.840\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n11\n00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.180\nWhat we're gonna be doing now\nis that we've got a blank slate,\n\n12\n00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.800\nwhich is Kali Linux, so\n\n13\n00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.740\nwhat we wanna do is we wanna start molding\nthat to what it is that we wanna do.\n\n14\n00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.700\nCuz presumably,\n\n15\n00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.450\nyou're gonna find a lot of tools that\nare in Kali that are quite useful.\n\n16\n00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.230\nI mean, that's the idea,\n\n17\n00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.190\nit is pretty packed with stuff that's very\nhandy to have and very useful to have.\n\n18\n00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.630\nThe next step comes in is that,\n\n19\n00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.530\nwell what can we do to start\ntweaking that a bit more.\n\n20\n00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.880\nAnd there's actually quite a bit.\n\n21\n00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.420\nWhen I get into my desktop,\nlike I have up on screen here.\n\n22\n00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.650\nI get into my desktop.\n\n23\n00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.210\nI've got that blank slate.\n\n24\n00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.340\nThe question is, what's next?\n\n25\n00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.460\nWell, what's next is,\nthere's a number of things.\n\n26\n00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.910\nFirst of all, one of the things\nthat would come into play.\n\n27\n00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.670\nI don't happen to have it here, and\ninstalled in this virtual environment.\n\n28\n00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.770\nBut if you install a physical environment,\none of the things I try to get squared\n\n29\n00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.390\naway is make sure that all your\nhardware and everything is working.\n\n30\n00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.260\nIt's possible when you go through and\n\n31\n00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.820\nyou do this, that you may have\na piece of hardware here and\n\n32\n00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.050\nthere that just decides it's not\ngonna play ball, it's not gonna work.\n\n33\n00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.285\nAnd if that's the case,\nfirst of all you can check in your system\n\n34\n00:01:53.285 --> 00:01:58.305\nsettings for your hardware to see\nif there's any proprietary drivers.\n\n35\n00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:03.932\nOne of the things about Kali Linux,\nis if there's a proprietary driver,\n\n36\n00:02:03.932 --> 00:02:08.215\na closed sourced driver's\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n37\n00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:12.150\nIf it detects a closed service driver for\nsomething that you're using\n\n38\n00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.686\non your system, it will recognize the fact\nthat you have that piece of hardware,\n\n39\n00:02:16.686 --> 00:02:19.400\nit needs that driver or it won't load it.\n\n40\n00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.080\nSo what you'll have to do, is just\nspecifically go in and activate it.\n\n41\n00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.940\nAnd once you activate it,\nit may ask you to reboot the system.\n\n42\n00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.980\nAnd lo and behold,\nthat piece of hardware works.\n\n43\n00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.310\nMost of the time, I can say that you're\nprobably not gonna run into that.\n\n44\n00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.880\nIt's not nearly as\ncommon as it used to be.\n\n45\n00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.156\nHowever, if you do have\nsomething like any sort of,\n\n46\n00:02:38.156 --> 00:02:41.290\nmore off the beaten path hardware,\nolder stuff.\n\n47\n00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.160\nOne of the one's I've seen is\nthose Nvidia graphics cards.\n\n48\n00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.315\nThat family of graphics cards seems\nto have some issues in being detected\n\n49\n00:02:52.315 --> 00:02:53.003\nwith Kali.\n\n50\n00:02:53.003 --> 00:02:57.378\nIf that's the case, you may actually\nhave to activate the driver, or\n\n51\n00:02:57.378 --> 00:03:01.621\nyou may need to download the driver\nfrom Nvidia and load it in there.\n\n52\n00:03:01.621 --> 00:03:05.521\nAnd Nvidia's good about supporting\ntheir stuff in Linux, so\n\n53\n00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:10.771\nthat's the good thing is that even though,\nyou may not initially have it running,\n\n54\n00:03:10.771 --> 00:03:14.450\nthen you can get it running,\nwhich is always a good thing.\n\n55\n00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.150\nAn extra step, but not anything that we\nhaven't had to deal with for years and\n\n56\n00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.565\nyears and years at this point.\n\n57\n00:03:20.565 --> 00:03:21.888\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But if it's there and\n\n58\n00:03:21.888 --> 00:03:26.343\njust not activating for you, but\nrecognizing that there's a need for it,\n\n59\n00:03:26.343 --> 00:03:29.825\nit's a just a matter of right clicking and\nactivating it.\n\n60\n00:03:29.825 --> 00:03:33.599\nLike I said I don't have that situation\nhere, because it's inside a very simple\n\n61\n00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.889\nvirtualized environment, so\nthere's nothing like that existing.\n\n62\n00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.990\nBut do look for that,\nif you have anything that's not working.\n\n63\n00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.010\nCheck to make sure that aside from\nthe fact that maybe some systems\n\n64\n00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.710\nhave an on and off switch,\nlike my system here has an on and\n\n65\n00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.440\noff switches for wireless and\nblue tooth and stuff like that.\n\n66\n00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.340\nProvided that you don't have\none of those switches set,\n\n67\n00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.720\ncheck to make sure that the driver\nhas been loaded but not activated, or\n\n68\n00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.180\nyou just have to go to\nsomeplace else to do it.\n\n69\n00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.540\nHopefully it's one of those things, and\n\n70\n00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.320\nnot something else that's\nkinda crazy weird.\n\n71\n00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.680\nI've had that happen.\n\n72\n00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.510\nOkay, so once you've got that squared\naway, and got that taken care of,\n\n73\n00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.790\nother stuff you might wanna start looking\nat is doing stuff to manage your users.\n\n74\n00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.340\nManaging your users\nshould be fairly simple,\n\n75\n00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.130\nfirst of all,\nyou can create new user accounts.\n\n76\n00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.890\nYou've got options to\ncreate new user accounts.\n\n77\n00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.440\nYou can do user add.\n\n78\n00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.990\nAnd then type in the name\nof a user in here, so\n\n79\n00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.080\ndo user add and type in the name and\nit's gonna add a user at that name.\n\n80\n00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.680\nIf I want to change the password,\nyou can just do passwd and it asks, okay\n\n81\n00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.635\nwhat do you want to change the password\nto, and I can change the password.\n\n82\n00:04:51.635 --> 00:04:54.613\n[NOISE] To what I want.\n\n83\n00:04:54.613 --> 00:04:55.366\nUpdated it.\n\n84\n00:04:55.366 --> 00:04:57.680\n>> Nice.\n>> So you can do that right there.\n\n85\n00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.880\nYou don't have to do it there.\n\n86\n00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.052\nIf you're kinda someone that decides\nthat this isn't the way you wanna do it,\n\n87\n00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:05.265\nbecause you know what, you're like\nscrew it, I'm using the GUI, right.\n\n88\n00:05:05.265 --> 00:05:08.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You do have the ability\n\n89\n00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.220\nto go under system settings.\n\n90\n00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.780\nRemember that's over here,\non this side right here.\n\n91\n00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.245\nWe can click on the little, it's supposed\nto be a wrench and a screwdriver.\n\n92\n00:05:20.245 --> 00:05:21.627\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Screwdriver,\n\n93\n00:05:21.627 --> 00:05:23.773\nthe one you use to turn screws,\nnot drinky drinky.\n\n94\n00:05:23.773 --> 00:05:27.152\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, you've got that and once you open\n\n95\n00:05:27.152 --> 00:05:32.817\nthis up, you can go to Users, and you can\nsee that it's got some accounts in there.\n\n96\n00:05:32.817 --> 00:05:35.880\nNotice the root one isn't listed.\n\n97\n00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.440\nThat's already there.\n\n98\n00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.708\nI'm using that one right now.\n\n99\n00:05:39.708 --> 00:05:48.438\nBut there's a couple other user\naccounts that I can use if I wanted to.\n\n100\n00:05:48.438 --> 00:05:52.369\nSo there you have a-\n>> Those would be standard users\n\n101\n00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:53.095\nat this point?\n\n102\n00:05:53.095 --> 00:05:57.715\n>> Those would be standard users, yeah,\nand they tell you right on there,\n\n103\n00:05:57.715 --> 00:06:03.945\nyou can see it says account type standard,\nso you've got it right there, ready to go.\n\n104\n00:06:03.945 --> 00:06:05.555\n>> We had questions earlier,\n\n105\n00:06:05.555 --> 00:06:07.800\nusers concerned about logging\non as root all the time.\n\n106\n00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.394\nSo now you can make\na standard account there, and\n\n107\n00:06:10.394 --> 00:06:12.173\nnot worry about running as root.\n\n108\n00:06:12.173 --> 00:06:16.860\n>> Yeah,\nif that's a big deal to you to not\n\n109\n00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.555\nrun as root,\n>> Then yeah create another user account,\n\n110\n00:06:20.555 --> 00:06:22.369\nyou already saw a couple ways to do that.\n\n111\n00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:26.512\nJust go ahead create a new user account,\nand go ahead and\n\n112\n00:06:26.512 --> 00:06:30.760\nstart using that instead,\nif that works better for you.\n\n113\n00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.232\nSo, that's always a great thing and\nyou could see depending on the usage,\n\n114\n00:06:34.232 --> 00:06:37.756\nthe history, the accounts you can even\nview that stuff in there if you want,\n\n115\n00:06:37.756 --> 00:06:39.894\nyou got a little history button and\nall that.\n\n116\n00:06:39.894 --> 00:06:40.547\n>> Nice.\n>> So\n\n117\n00:06:40.547 --> 00:06:46.160\npretty cool to have the ability\nto do that a couple of ways.\n\n118\n00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.650\nSo if you want to write a script, or\nif you want to do it this way, you can.\n\n119\n00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.040\nSo there's that.\n\n120\n00:06:54.040 --> 00:07:01.480\nI would tell you for passwords,\npeople will go out and\n\n121\n00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.500\ntype password and want to change their\npassword for their current account,\n\n122\n00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.520\nyou can say if you type password just\nlike this, you can actually say,\n\n123\n00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.270\nwell I want to change the password for\nmy current account.\n\n124\n00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.790\nAnd type it in and\nchange it to whatever you want it to be.\n\n125\n00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.670\nIf you want to change it for\na specific account,\n\n126\n00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.070\njust tell it which account\nyou wanna change it for.\n\n127\n00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:26.870\n>> Nice.\n>> And so, there is that deal.\n\n128\n00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.400\nSo I'll just go ahead and type in my\nnew account, or my new password for\n\n129\n00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.180\nmy current account.\n\n130\n00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.520\nAnd boom, update successfully.\n\n131\n00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.640\nI'm happy.\n\n132\n00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.200\nAnd we are ready to go.\n\n133\n00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.449\nThey tell you, most places that document\nstuff on Kali will tell you the first\n\n134\n00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:47.715\nthing you should do when go in, is change\nyour password for the root account.\n\n135\n00:07:47.715 --> 00:07:52.236\nHowever the way I kind of look at this is,\nis that If you notice\n\n136\n00:07:52.236 --> 00:07:57.090\nduring the installation you set\nthe password for this anyway.\n\n137\n00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.980\nYou set the password for the root account,\nso do you have to change it again?\n\n138\n00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.980\nIf you want, you're really paranoid and\ndon't trust yourself,\n\n139\n00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:02.880\nchange it again, whatever.\n\n140\n00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.810\n>> During the installation I told like\nseven people what my password was, so\n\n141\n00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.330\nyou know, I better change that.\n\n142\n00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.140\n>> Yeah I had to change my account,\nI'm gonna change my account but.\n\n143\n00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.460\nFirst, I've got a list of people\nI've got to take care of so\n\n144\n00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.880\nyou don't see the [LAUGH].\n\n145\n00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:24.350\nBut I would tell you, though,\nif you have a, if you're using an image or\n\n146\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.740\nsomething that's been made by someone\nelse then absolutely you shouldn't be,\n\n147\n00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.660\nyou should log in with that account and\nthen change the password for\n\n148\n00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.010\nit if you're making an image for it.\n\n149\n00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.200\nThat's just the common sense side of it.\n\n150\n00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.780\nSo be aware of that.\n\n151\n00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.200\nSo we've already got a couple things down.\n\n152\n00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.435\nWe've made sure we've got our\nproprietary drivers down,\n\n153\n00:08:43.435 --> 00:08:45.902\nwe've made sure our accounts been updated.\n\n154\n00:08:45.902 --> 00:08:49.680\nYou know, so\nwe're doing pretty good so far there.\n\n155\n00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.810\nBut there are other things you can do.\n\n156\n00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.210\nYou can obviously do some of\nthe things that people like doing.\n\n157\n00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.550\nI'll just kind of minimize this for\nright now.\n\n158\n00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.935\nYou know, you can go ahead and\nyou can start, you know.\n\n159\n00:08:59.935 --> 00:09:02.390\nCustomizing your desktop and\nstuff like that if you want,\n\n160\n00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.140\nI mean there's all sorts of things,\nI mean we have our\n\n161\n00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:10.200\nsystem settings that allows us to\nchange all our good stuff over here.\n\n162\n00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.810\nYour printers and\nall that typical operating system stuff,\n\n163\n00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.190\nI'm not even gonna worry\nabout going through all that.\n\n164\n00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:20.580\nTo that type of stuff here because it's\nprobably not real necessary to do that\n\n165\n00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.090\nas far as what we're doing.\n\n166\n00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:24.530\nSo you can do that.\n\n167\n00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.740\nThe thing I would tell you though\nis when you're doing this,\n\n168\n00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.330\nwhen you are going through installing and\n\n169\n00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.530\nconfiguring this system is something we're\ngoing to talk about on another episode.\n\n170\n00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:40.180\nIs if you're going to be\ncreating an image of this system.\n\n171\n00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.440\nThen you're going to want to\nreally carefully think about\n\n172\n00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.050\nhow you want that system to look when you\ndeploy the ISO file to other systems.\n\n173\n00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.560\nYou're gonna want to start thinking of\nwhat you want as a standardized background\n\n174\n00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.630\nand what type of things you want.\n\n175\n00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.520\nDo you need to load any drivers in\nthere before you create the image or\n\n176\n00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.090\nmake them available,\nthose types of things.\n\n177\n00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.790\nRight now I'm just talking\nat a desktop level.\n\n178\n00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.780\nBut, setting up for me, but if it wasn't\njust for me, if it was something I\n\n179\n00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.390\nwas going to use on other systems and\nbe deployed as a universal image.\n\n180\n00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.596\nMaybe I got a pen testing team or\nsomething.\n\n181\n00:10:12.596 --> 00:10:16.684\nThen I'm just going to go ahead and set it\nup for everyone right across the board.\n\n182\n00:10:16.684 --> 00:10:17.386\nOkay.\n\n183\n00:10:17.386 --> 00:10:21.286\nAs far as packages go,\nthat would be the next thing is tools and\n\n184\n00:10:21.286 --> 00:10:24.120\nsoftware you want to get installed.\n\n185\n00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.140\nOne of the things I wanted to make\nsure that you are aware of is\n\n186\n00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:37.250\nyou know you've got Metasploit over here,\nMetasploit of course we went ahead and.\n\n187\n00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.190\nDid a whole series of shows on Metasploit.\n\n188\n00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.570\nSo I'm starting up here for the first\ntime and it's doing this whole thing.\n\n189\n00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.150\nRemember, this is just basic Metasploit.\n\n190\n00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.880\nIf you wanna go and\ninstall the other levels of Metasploit,\n\n191\n00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.670\nyou are going to need to go\nto Rapid 7 site and go for\n\n192\n00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:58.530\nthe whole kind of go through there.\n\n193\n00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:05.930\nThis does have Armitage on it, in fact you\ncan see Armitage's little icon it's got\n\n194\n00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:11.870\nthat picture of an anime style woman\nover there so you can just go ahead and\n\n195\n00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:16.540\nget it to start up and\nit will go ahead and take care of the job.\n\n196\n00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.262\nIt should take care of,\n\n197\n00:11:17.262 --> 00:11:20.440\nconnecting to the database and\ninstalling everything for you.\n\n198\n00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.510\nAnd you should be ready to go.\n\n199\n00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.015\nSo it does have those tools so\n\n200\n00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:28.240\nMetasploit's there it just may not\nbe the version that you're used to.\n\n201\n00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.370\nSo if you need to have\na more robust version or\n\n202\n00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:36.680\nyou have the pro version with all the\nbells and whistles, that's not here, so\n\n203\n00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.860\nyou'll need to go install separately.\n\n204\n00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:44.287\nSo just kind of an FYI some people\ndo kind of get caught on that.\n\n205\n00:11:44.287 --> 00:11:45.879\nAs far as that goes,\n\n206\n00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:51.597\nif you wanna install stuff like\nRapid Seven's Vulnerability Scanner,\n\n207\n00:11:51.597 --> 00:11:57.406\nbecause they have their own too, or\nNexpose, if you wanna install that,\n\n208\n00:11:57.406 --> 00:12:01.640\nthen you're gonna have to go ahead and\ninstall that.\n\n209\n00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.040\nThat doesn't come here either.\n\n210\n00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:10.170\nOnly vulnerability scanner it has actually\nis open vase or a full blown one.\n\n211\n00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:14.380\nRemember, open vase was mentioned\nin our ethical hacking classes and\n\n212\n00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.130\nour forensic class.\n\n213\n00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:20.030\nIt's the cousin of Nexus.\n\n214\n00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:25.850\nSo if you really want Nexus,\nyou'll have to grab that.\n\n215\n00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:30.580\nBut those may be some tools that you need\nto go ahead and install and download.\n\n216\n00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.529\nAs far as installing these tools.\n\n217\n00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.710\nOther things, and\ngetting it ready for use.\n\n218\n00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:44.400\nI would go over here to my desktop,\nI clicked on the little dot icon, or\n\n219\n00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.410\nthe little tic tac toe icon type icon,\nor six by six dot icon over here.\n\n220\n00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:54.610\nAnd that brought up, just show you when\nyou click on it, it brings up this.\n\n221\n00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:57.910\nI am gonna click on the second\nlittle dot here, and\n\n222\n00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:01.360\nyou can see it's got the package and\nthe package updater.\n\n223\n00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.390\nThat should also be one of\nthe first things that you do.\n\n224\n00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.120\nSo, make a point.\n\n225\n00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.210\nYou click on packages,\nit will tell you, hey,\n\n226\n00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:13.450\nyou're running as a privileged user,\nwhich in this case I am.\n\n227\n00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:14.810\nIt goes ahead.\n\n228\n00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:23.190\nThe package manager allows you to install\nstuff right out of the KLEE repositories.\n\n229\n00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.480\nThese are ones that they've\njust made available.\n\n230\n00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.040\nThere are other repositories\nin addition to what's here.\n\n231\n00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.620\nAt another time, we'll talk about that.\n\n232\n00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:37.600\nBut you can add additional ones\nwith other tools as you see fit.\n\n233\n00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.650\nThe other thing to do in here\nis in addition to like I said,\n\n234\n00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:46.630\ndo the updates is right next to it\nis the package updates you can click\n\n235\n00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:50.080\non that and\nit will also go do a quick scan.\n\n236\n00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.230\nYou can see what I have going on here.\n\n237\n00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.170\nI clicked on this package updater and\nit went through and said hey,\n\n238\n00:13:56.170 --> 00:14:00.920\nthese things are something that\nhave had updates done to them.\n\n239\n00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.360\nAnd it says there's 16 updates available.\n\n240\n00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.600\nOkay, well I got 16 updates available.\n\n241\n00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.250\nIf I wanted to, which I'm not going\nto do here, live, but go ahead and\n\n242\n00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.080\nclick install.\n\n243\n00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.970\nIt's going to go ahead and\nreboot the thing.\n\n244\n00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:18.840\nAnd if it has to, it will reboot the thing\nand I'll have the latest updates.\n\n245\n00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.710\nSo that's something else\nthat you're gonna wanna do.\n\n246\n00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:26.360\nGoing back to something that was\nmentioned just a bit ago, though.\n\n247\n00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.470\nThose proprietary drivers?\n\n248\n00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:32.890\nThose proprietary drivers, if you get to\na situation where you have a proprietary\n\n249\n00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:38.640\ndriver in there or have a piece of\nhardware that it's not recognizing,\n\n250\n00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.150\nand you don't see a proprietary driver,\nI guess is a better way to put it.\n\n251\n00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.740\nThen you might want to go ahead and\ndo an update.\n\n252\n00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.890\nCuz it might actually, when it does\nthe update it might say, oh yeah,\n\n253\n00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:52.510\nby the way I do have something that wasn't\npart of that specific installation.\n\n254\n00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.970\nBut I do have something that's out,\nthat's been out there.\n\n255\n00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:01.130\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and install that or\nmake that available to you if you want it,\n\n256\n00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.230\nand then you just gotta go ahead and\ndownload it.\n\n257\n00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.270\nInstall it, activate it, and you're done.\n\n258\n00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.070\n>> Yeah.\n>> So that may\n\n259\n00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.410\ntake care of that little problem for\nyou, too.\n\n260\n00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:11.960\nIf that doesn't do it, then you just may\nhave to go the old fashioned way and\n\n261\n00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.700\ngo download a drive someplace else and\nthen install it,\n\n262\n00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.790\nwhich is usually fairly easy anyway.\n\n263\n00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:21.310\nSo it's not like it's a big,\nscary thing to have to deal with.\n\n264\n00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.260\n>> So really, and we have to do this\nwith most of our operating systems,\n\n265\n00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.490\nso no surprise that the Kali you\ngotta go through the same thing.\n\n266\n00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:31.240\nEven if that ISO was compiled a month ago,\n\n267\n00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.800\nthings have changed since that ISO was\ncompiled and available for download.\n\n268\n00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.550\nSo you just installed it today,\n\n269\n00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:39.890\nthat doesn't mean you've got\neverything up to date to today, right?\n\n270\n00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.290\nYou've got to go out there and\nget your drivers,\n\n271\n00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:46.270\nmake sure all your hardware's working,\nand you've got to update Kali itself and\n\n272\n00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:47.410\nall the packages that come with it.\n\n273\n00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:49.883\nWhich they obviously make very easy,\nyou just go in in there,\n\n274\n00:15:49.883 --> 00:15:52.324\nclick on those buttons,\nreaches out, find those updates.\n\n275\n00:15:52.324 --> 00:15:54.884\nBut that really, like you said,\nshould be the first thing you do.\n\n276\n00:15:54.884 --> 00:15:57.636\nBecause you don't want to bang your head\ntrying to figure out why something's\n\n277\n00:15:57.636 --> 00:15:58.145\nnot working.\n\n278\n00:15:58.145 --> 00:16:01.059\nWhen there was an update waiting and\nall you had to do was get that update and\n\n279\n00:16:01.059 --> 00:16:02.147\neverything would be fine.\n\n280\n00:16:02.147 --> 00:16:03.650\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n281\n00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:08.050\nSo I would definitely recommend checking\nsome of this stuff just from the get go to\n\n282\n00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.900\nmake sure you keep\nyourself out of trouble.\n\n283\n00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.550\nSomething else to look at here,\nby the way, that I've got up on my screen,\n\n284\n00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:20.430\nis some other things that if\nyou might be using these tools,\n\n285\n00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:24.720\nit's not absolutely critical but I might\nconsider a post installation task if I\n\n286\n00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.698\nknow I'm going to be using these tools.\n\n287\n00:16:26.698 --> 00:16:30.030\nStuff like under this\nvulnerability analysis,\n\n288\n00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:34.025\nI have OpenVZ, you can see how\nthe three things there for it.\n\n289\n00:16:34.025 --> 00:16:38.630\nOpenVZ when I click on it,\nit has some initial set-up it has to do.\n\n290\n00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:41.750\nAnd what that does is it's downloading\nupdates and stuff like that for\n\n291\n00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:42.670\nits database.\n\n292\n00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.270\nSo, while this isn't something that's\na deal-breaker as far as post-installation\n\n293\n00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.580\ngoes, it's something that\nthis could take a while.\n\n294\n00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:53.260\nSo if you're going to be using this and\nyou know you're gonna be going at a client\n\n295\n00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:57.205\nsite or something, then you might\nwanna go ahead and download this.\n\n296\n00:16:57.205 --> 00:17:00.020\nCuz this can, initially, can take a while.\n\n297\n00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.950\nI mean you can see on here,\nI just clicked on it.\n\n298\n00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:06.540\nI'm on a hardwire connection here and\nthat could take some time.\n\n299\n00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:10.960\nYou can see it here,\nit's rebuilding indexes of vulnerabilities\n\n300\n00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.380\nit's got on file and seeing okay,\nwhat do I have and what is out there\n\n301\n00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:20.480\non the update servers and I need to\ndownload to reconcile these databases.\n\n302\n00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.430\n>> Probably wouldn't look too good on\nyour initial bill to your customer,\n\n303\n00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.900\nspent the first two hours\nupdating my own software.\n\n304\n00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.460\nYeah, not gonna fly, huh.\n\n305\n00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.010\n>> Well if you creatively\nword it you can bill for it.\n\n306\n00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:32.720\nYou know, so [LAUGH].\n\n307\n00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.990\nI was customizing stuff for\nyour environment.\n\n308\n00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:37.000\n>> There we go.\n\n309\n00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.067\n>> Oh, really?\nOh, yeah.\n\n310\n00:17:38.067 --> 00:17:38.940\nTotally.\n\n311\n00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.277\nDo I look like a scam artist to you?\n\n312\n00:17:42.277 --> 00:17:46.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Things like this you might check\n\n313\n00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:47.750\nthe tools.\n\n314\n00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.460\nNot just install the tools that you want.\n\n315\n00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.110\nLike, I talked about Metasploit.\n\n316\n00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:56.230\nIf you need an expose, if you need Nessus,\nif you wanna go through that, we went\n\n317\n00:17:56.230 --> 00:18:01.310\nto that website and in our ethical hacking\ncourse to set tools at the work site.\n\n318\n00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:02.340\nIf you want to go through that,\n\n319\n00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.645\ninstall some of those things in there too,\nthen go for it.\n\n320\n00:18:05.645 --> 00:18:09.265\nGet what you need in there, make sure\nthey're updated and ready to use and\n\n321\n00:18:09.265 --> 00:18:09.885\nready to go.\n\n322\n00:18:09.885 --> 00:18:14.225\nThat's where I am kind of gonna\nstart concentrating my time.\n\n323\n00:18:14.225 --> 00:18:17.055\nSo most of the tools that you'll find,\nstuff like NMAP and\n\n324\n00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:20.550\nstuff like that, new versions\nthat come out periodically but\n\n325\n00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.830\nthey usually don't need any major\nupdates or anything done to them.\n\n326\n00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:29.430\nIt's stuff like you see\nhere with OpenVZ that\n\n327\n00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:34.440\nhas that database of vulnerabilities\nthat needs to be updated.\n\n328\n00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.510\nIt's things like that that you're\ngonna wanna keep an eye on and\n\n329\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:41.660\nnot get caught flat-footed and\ntry and do a vulnerability scan.\n\n330\n00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:46.410\nAll of a sudden, this thing's sitting here\ntaking an hour to do its initial update.\n\n331\n00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:50.770\nSomeone, aside from the billing thing, all\nkidding aside, you do that on a site with\n\n332\n00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:54.080\na client, if you're out there,\nwhat you're not ready to do your stuff?\n\n333\n00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.920\nShouldn't you be ready?\n\n334\n00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.820\n>> So you'd say it's probably a good\nidea maybe just to go through and\n\n335\n00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.400\nat least open up all the tools\nyou plan on using and\n\n336\n00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.220\njust make sure they're functioning.\n\n337\n00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:06.030\nKind of the same thing we do when we\ndeploy an image out of Windows and\n\n338\n00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:06.720\nthings like that, right?\n\n339\n00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.230\nWe want to make sure everything is\nfunctioning before we hand it to\n\n340\n00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.880\nthe end user.\n\n341\n00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.590\nIn this case we're the end user, but\n\n342\n00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.780\nwe don't want to run into\nit at the client site.\n\n343\n00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.620\nSo fire everything up,\ntest everything, make your shortcuts,\n\n344\n00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:20.170\ncustomize that interface\nto suit your workflow.\n\n345\n00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:22.410\nYou know,\nthe tools that you use most often,\n\n346\n00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.380\nthrow them out there on the desktop or\nwhatever it is.\n\n347\n00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.580\nJust get it ready for that first job.\n\n348\n00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.380\n>> Yeah.\nIt's completely reasonable\n\n349\n00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.470\nto have to do those sorts of things.\n\n350\n00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.170\nTo do that initial check on things.\n\n351\n00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:38.100\nI looked through the stuff that we\nhave sitting out here on screen.\n\n352\n00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.350\nYou can see that when I go\nthrough information gathering you\n\n353\n00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:43.410\ncan see stuff like Maltego.\n\n354\n00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:45.160\nMaltego has a database.\n\n355\n00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.760\nWe showed Maltego in our ethical\nhacking and forensic stuff.\n\n356\n00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:49.910\nThat's one that has to updated.\n\n357\n00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:52.060\nThere's database in there that's updated.\n\n358\n00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.050\nIf you're gonna use that,\nthen you should do that.\n\n359\n00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:58.870\nNikto uses the Google hacking database,\n\n360\n00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:02.910\nit's not there by default,\nyou have to download and install that.\n\n361\n00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.380\nSo you can keep going through.\n\n362\n00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.900\nYou see the web application analysis, it's\nalso got stuff that needs to be updated.\n\n363\n00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:11.690\nDatabase, password list, if you're\ngoing to be using password cracking,\n\n364\n00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:15.020\nmost of these things will\nneed a password list.\n\n365\n00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:19.969\nSo you either will have to download those\ndictionary files if you're gonna use them,\n\n366\n00:20:19.969 --> 00:20:22.181\nor you're gonna have to create them.\n\n367\n00:20:22.181 --> 00:20:25.255\nBecause you do not,\nespecially with some of these things,\n\n368\n00:20:25.255 --> 00:20:28.490\nyou do not want to have to sit on site and\ngenerate this stuff.\n\n369\n00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:32.560\nOr have to, even if you're not on-site,\njust sitting at home be like click.\n\n370\n00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.078\nBecause those password lists,\nif you have to wait to go,\n\n371\n00:20:35.078 --> 00:20:37.446\nif you're the initial\nit can take some time.\n\n372\n00:20:37.446 --> 00:20:40.540\nAnd I shouldn't even have to\ntell you about rainbow tables.\n\n373\n00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.206\nYou know, you do that,\nit's like, no, you're done.\n\n374\n00:20:43.206 --> 00:20:45.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Fortunately you can buy rainbow tables,\n\n375\n00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:48.970\nbut then again you still have to wait for\nthose to get there.\n\n376\n00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:54.690\nBut I would go through this list\nin addition to installing whatever\n\n377\n00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:59.780\ntools you think you're gonna need or\npart of your favorite toolkit.\n\n378\n00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.560\nMake sure that you've\ngot these all updated,\n\n379\n00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.510\nanything that needs a database update.\n\n380\n00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:06.040\nGo ahead and use it.\n\n381\n00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.990\nYou know I kind of agree with you Mike\nsaying, you know, it's maybe not a bad\n\n382\n00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:15.900\nidea to go through these tools and\ncheck to make sure they're updated.\n\n383\n00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.190\nMyself, I'd probably be a little\nmore limited than that.\n\n384\n00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:22.410\nI know which ones I'm more\nthan likely gonna be using and\n\n385\n00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:25.070\nI'd go to those ones first and\nmake sure they're updated.\n\n386\n00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:29.180\nBut if you're not sure or if it's your\nfirst time going through this and\n\n387\n00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:33.420\ngoing through Kali 2.0,\nthen it's entirely reasonable for\n\n388\n00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:38.100\nyou to have to click through everything\nto see if it needs to be updated.\n\n389\n00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.080\nSome stuff you can pretty much tell that\nit's not going to need to be updated I\n\n390\n00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.230\nmean NMap, stuff like that\nprobably not going to be updated.\n\n391\n00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:48.430\nBut other stuff, if you're not sure,\nclick it to see if it needs an update.\n\n392\n00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:54.883\nCuz the updates are gonna get caught\nthrough the updates that Kali itself has.\n\n393\n00:21:54.883 --> 00:21:59.271\nOr it's something that you're gonna click\nand it has to download the database, which\n\n394\n00:21:59.271 --> 00:22:03.239\nisn't an actual update, it's something\nthat the vendor makes available and\n\n395\n00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:05.520\nwhen you run their tool it brings it down.\n\n396\n00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.830\nSo, not an update,\njust something that makes their tool run.\n\n397\n00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:14.760\nSo, absolutely positively be aware of\nwhat your particular situation is.\n\n398\n00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.803\nOnce you've gone through this listing,\ngot all your tools, and\n\n399\n00:22:18.803 --> 00:22:22.051\neverything's setup,\nyou should be in good shape.\n\n400\n00:22:22.051 --> 00:22:27.203\nNow, one of the questions I did see,\nI kind of glanced over here and\n\n401\n00:22:27.203 --> 00:22:32.770\nsaw on this discussion group,\nis IceWeasel the default browser?\n\n402\n00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:33.575\nYeah, it is.\n\n403\n00:22:33.575 --> 00:22:35.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know how else to phrase that.\n\n404\n00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:37.400\nIt is the default browser.\n\n405\n00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.700\nI don't have a problem with it myself,\nusing it.\n\n406\n00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.600\nI think it's actually\nperfectly fine as a browser.\n\n407\n00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.690\nSome people don't like it.\n\n408\n00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:50.750\nIf that's you, go ahead,\ninstall Firefox or\n\n409\n00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:53.450\nwhatever you feel is\nthe one that you want.\n\n410\n00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:56.240\nMy personal feeling is,\non systems that I have,\n\n411\n00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.380\nI typically have three\nbrowsers installed anyway.\n\n412\n00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.240\nIt's probably not a bad idea to.\n\n413\n00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.620\n>> Can I get Microsoft Edge for Kali 2.0?\n\n414\n00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:07.835\n>> You probably could make it work.\n\n415\n00:23:07.835 --> 00:23:13.745\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] No, no, let's not.\n\n416\n00:23:13.745 --> 00:23:16.195\n>> Yeah, if you want to, you try it.\n\n417\n00:23:16.195 --> 00:23:19.105\nSo there's somebody out\nthere that's done it.\n\n418\n00:23:19.105 --> 00:23:22.575\nI know you can run pretty\nmuch any version of IE\n\n419\n00:23:22.575 --> 00:23:26.196\nyou want on Linux all simultaneously,\nif you want.\n\n420\n00:23:26.196 --> 00:23:29.045\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I did it to one of my friends\n\n421\n00:23:29.045 --> 00:23:29.650\nat one point.\n\n422\n00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:32.895\nIt's like, can you run IE, which I\nthought was already kind of a question.\n\n423\n00:23:32.895 --> 00:23:36.341\nIt's like, you need to stop smoking\nwhatever it is your smoking,\n\n424\n00:23:36.341 --> 00:23:38.937\nthat's not a question that someone asks,\nokay?\n\n425\n00:23:38.937 --> 00:23:42.640\nSo he's saying, oh, Linux can run,\nyeah but I can run IE.\n\n426\n00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.413\nI'm like, well so can I, it's not Linux.\n\n427\n00:23:45.413 --> 00:23:47.940\nAnd I said, yeah I can run it over here,\nwhich version do you want?\n\n428\n00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:52.260\nAnd I open them all up at once,\nlike four or five versions all at once.\n\n429\n00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.105\nWhich one do you want to run?\n\n430\n00:23:53.105 --> 00:23:53.901\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or\n\n431\n00:23:53.901 --> 00:23:57.110\nwhy don't you just run them all at once,\nit's freedom of choice, man, right?\n\n432\n00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.539\n[LAUGH]\n>> There you go, there you go.\n\n433\n00:23:59.539 --> 00:24:01.402\nAll right, well Sean,\na lot of great information there.\n\n434\n00:24:01.402 --> 00:24:04.900\nA lot of things you got to think about\nonce you've got that installation done.\n\n435\n00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.410\nWe're not quite finished, right?\n\n436\n00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:09.040\nWe've go to get our\ninstallation ready to use, and\n\n437\n00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.015\nthat means getting the updates just\nlike you would any operating system.\n\n438\n00:24:12.015 --> 00:24:16.305\nYou finish installing Kali, you've\ngotta go out there, get any updates for\n\n439\n00:24:16.305 --> 00:24:20.295\nthe operating system, updates for\nthe packages that are already included.\n\n440\n00:24:20.295 --> 00:24:23.415\nYou might be downloading new packages and\ninstalling those, and\n\n441\n00:24:23.415 --> 00:24:25.375\nthen getting updates for those packages.\n\n442\n00:24:25.375 --> 00:24:29.145\nGotta test all your hardware and make\nsure that everything's working properly,\n\n443\n00:24:29.145 --> 00:24:31.285\nmake sure it recognized it.\n\n444\n00:24:31.285 --> 00:24:34.820\nYou might have to get drivers, just like\nin any other operating systems they've\n\n445\n00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:39.050\ngot their like Windows has Driver.cab,\nI don't think it's the same in Linux but\n\n446\n00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.780\nyou know they've got a pool of drivers for\nmost hardware but\n\n447\n00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:46.380\nif you've got some one off hardware or\nspecialized hardware that you have to use,\n\n448\n00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:50.290\nyou might have to go get a driver and\ndownload that and install it.\n\n449\n00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.280\nCustomize you interface,\n\n450\n00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.920\ncreate additional accounts if you need\nthem, get all that done ahead of time.\n\n451\n00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.560\nAnd then as Sean pointed out.\n\n452\n00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.980\nSome of those tools,\neven though you go through the updates,\n\n453\n00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:04.110\nit's the tool itself is updated, but\nthe tool relies on a database and\n\n454\n00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:07.130\nthat database is either not there or\nneeds to be updated.\n\n455\n00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:09.180\nSo we might have to reach out and\nget those.\n\n456\n00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:13.720\nAnd, these are thing you don't want to run\ninto when you walk onto that job site.\n\n457\n00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.970\nWe really wanna have this\nstuff done ahead of time.\n\n458\n00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:18.770\nSo we look professional and we can\nbe more efficient and do our job and\n\n459\n00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:22.660\nnot be sweating bullets going, oh my gosh,\nI gotta update this real quick,\n\n460\n00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.730\nI hope they don't notice,\nthat kinda thing.\n\n461\n00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:26.880\nSo, a lot of things to do,\ncan't just install it and\n\n462\n00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.020\nget to work, gotta get some things done.\n\n463\n00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:32.570\nAnything else Sean we need to toss into\nthis episode before we wrap it up?\n\n464\n00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:37.280\n>> You know, you did bring up one thing\nI think would be kind of an interesting\n\n465\n00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:41.150\nthing also to do in there, is\n>> Is customize the interface.\n\n466\n00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:44.242\nOne of the things we mentioned in a prior\n\n467\n00:25:44.242 --> 00:25:48.310\nepisode is that Kali 2 is\nusing known by default.\n\n468\n00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:52.220\nYou're not in any way, shape,\nor form handcuffed to that.\n\n469\n00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:55.330\nThat you're stuck using YoNom.\n\n470\n00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:56.920\nSome people like using KDE.\n\n471\n00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.458\nSome people like using some of the other\ninterfaces that are even more lightweight\n\n472\n00:26:00.458 --> 00:26:01.990\nand trimmed down than that.\n\n473\n00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:06.280\nIf that's the case, that's another post\ninstallation task you can add onto this.\n\n474\n00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:11.440\nI just chose not to do that at this\npoint in time, but if that was the case,\n\n475\n00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:15.850\nthen yeah, you'd wanna start thinking\nabout what interface you change it to.\n\n476\n00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:17.100\nI'm gonna tell you, though,\n\n477\n00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:21.610\nthose interfaces, each of those\ninterfaces does do things differently.\n\n478\n00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:24.650\nThey do things a little differently.\n\n479\n00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:28.910\nThey have their own little quirks and\nbenefits and all that.\n\n480\n00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:32.335\nPlease, if you're gonna use any one of\nthem, make make sure that you've at least\n\n481\n00:26:32.335 --> 00:26:35.385\ntried it, you've tried it out a few\ntimes [LAUGH] and lived with it for\n\n482\n00:26:35.385 --> 00:26:37.425\na bit before you're kind of like,\noh I'm just gonna go for\n\n483\n00:26:37.425 --> 00:26:40.345\nthat because that sounds really cool,\nit makes it really fast and all that.\n\n484\n00:26:40.345 --> 00:26:41.635\nI've seen people do that and I'm like,\n\n485\n00:26:41.635 --> 00:26:45.390\nwell I'm just gonna use the really\nlightweight interface because it makes\n\n486\n00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:49.880\neverything faster because there's\nvery little overhead graphically.\n\n487\n00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.740\nYeah, but it also kinda sucks to use\nunless you're really an expert and\n\n488\n00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:59.000\nknow every option, or have a very good\nexpectation of when you right click or do\n\n489\n00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.610\nsomething what should be on that shortcut\nmenu because there's nothing there.\n\n490\n00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:08.285\n>> You know so\notherwise it's kind of, some of these\n\n491\n00:27:08.285 --> 00:27:14.220\nmenus are almost to the point where it's\nif you know how to install the interface,\n\n492\n00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.400\nyou probably know how to use\nthe product so I'm not helping you.\n\n493\n00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.290\n[LAUGH] That's kind of the way it is.\n\n494\n00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:21.290\nSo up to you if you want to do that.\n\n495\n00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:22.710\nNothing wrong with that.\n\n496\n00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.800\nBut make sure that that is\nreally the way you wanna work\n\n497\n00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.470\nbefore you just switch over to one.\n\n498\n00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:31.450\nSo, try 'em out, see what you think,\nand then customize that as appropriate.\n\n499\n00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:34.210\n>> And if you can't figure it out,\n1-800-Shawn-Royano\n\n500\n00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:35.655\n>> No, don't be calling me, no.\n\n501\n00:27:35.655 --> 00:27:40.341\n[LAUGH] All right, well, ladies and\ngentlemen, another great episode here,\n\n502\n00:27:40.341 --> 00:27:44.040\nlearning about Post-Installation Tasks\nwith Kali 2.0.\n\n503\n00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.940\nBut for now, signing off for\nITProTV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n504\n00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:47.960\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n505\n00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.646\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n506\n00:27:49.646 --> 00:27:54.579\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.816\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:21.339\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at creating a image for\n\n5\n00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.364\nKali we can use to install, but\nwe're gonna tweak a little bit.\n\n6\n00:00:25.364 --> 00:00:28.255\nInstead of doing a default\ninstall of Kali,\n\n7\n00:00:28.255 --> 00:00:31.781\nSean's gonna show us how\nwe can customize the image.\n\n8\n00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:35.616\nAnd Sean, when you say customize are we\ntalking like loading additional tools and\n\n9\n00:00:35.616 --> 00:00:37.794\nstuff like that other\nthan the default tools.\n\n10\n00:00:37.794 --> 00:00:41.769\n>> Yes indeed,\nyou can do that to your heart's content.\n\n11\n00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.142\nIn fact,\nyou can do a whole heck of a lot more.\n\n12\n00:00:44.142 --> 00:00:47.868\nIt all depends on how much time and\neffort you're willing to put into this.\n\n13\n00:00:47.868 --> 00:00:51.147\nIt does take some time, so it's not\nsomething that just happens over night.\n\n14\n00:00:51.147 --> 00:00:56.171\nIt's something that does take you\ninvesting some time and effort to really\n\n15\n00:00:56.171 --> 00:01:00.891\nget it and do expect along the way to\nget little hiccups here and there.\n\n16\n00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:03.990\nI encountered those myself, but\nthey're all easily solvable,\n\n17\n00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.484\nespecially if you've got good knowledge\nof the Linux operating system,\n\n18\n00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:09.871\nyou pretty much can resolve\nsome of those errors.\n\n19\n00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:14.322\nI just noticed that the instructions that\nare out there along the way sometimes they\n\n20\n00:01:14.322 --> 00:01:15.539\nleave something out.\n\n21\n00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.463\nOr in some cases, usually this is the\ncase, is it's not that we leave something\n\n22\n00:01:19.463 --> 00:01:23.176\nout, it's the fact that you patched\nyour system and installed software.\n\n23\n00:01:23.176 --> 00:01:26.945\nRemember those old Windows days where\nyou had oh, this isn't the right DLL or\n\n24\n00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:28.347\nthis isn't the right this?\n\n25\n00:01:28.347 --> 00:01:30.479\nThat's more likely what's causing it, but\n\n26\n00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.962\nthe good news is those\nare easily fixable problems.\n\n27\n00:01:32.962 --> 00:01:38.285\nSo you can get around it,\nno problem what so ever.\n\n28\n00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:39.145\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n29\n00:01:39.145 --> 00:01:42.925\nSo, it might be something that\nwe use Kali as it is for awhile,\n\n30\n00:01:42.925 --> 00:01:47.435\nfind there are certain things that we\nwould like to always be there and then\n\n31\n00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:52.495\nthat's kind of how we progress, decide\nthat we would like to make a custom image.\n\n32\n00:01:52.495 --> 00:01:56.984\n>> Yeah, that's kind of the way I see\nthis is that you can use the default Kali\n\n33\n00:01:56.984 --> 00:02:01.257\nas a stock one and then just install\nthe stuff that you want off of it, or\n\n34\n00:02:01.257 --> 00:02:02.144\nwant into it.\n\n35\n00:02:02.144 --> 00:02:06.661\nOr you can build a custom image that has\nthe tools you want already in there and\n\n36\n00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:07.656\nthat's great.\n\n37\n00:02:07.656 --> 00:02:09.890\nBecause if you need to\ndeploy another laptop or\n\n38\n00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.285\nanother penetration testing device,\nyou could do it quite rapidly.\n\n39\n00:02:13.285 --> 00:02:17.721\nYou can also wipe a device quite\nrapidly using just the ISO file,\n\n40\n00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:19.702\nyou mount it and it's gone.\n\n41\n00:02:19.702 --> 00:02:23.708\nThink of it in the same context as\nyou would as creating a custom image\n\n42\n00:02:23.708 --> 00:02:25.099\nof Windows-\n>> Yeah.\n\n43\n00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.290\n>> That you put all your stuff you want\nin there and you can script it and\n\n44\n00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.955\nget it to install and yes,\nyou can script the Kali install.\n\n45\n00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:38.569\nAs a matter of fact,\nyou can really script it to a high degree.\n\n46\n00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.736\nYou can actually have scripts run at\ndifferent points of the installation\n\n47\n00:02:41.736 --> 00:02:44.970\nprocess, something that's really not\npossible the same way in Windows.\n\n48\n00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.302\nCuz Windows, you get the stuff for\nthe answer file and\n\n49\n00:02:48.302 --> 00:02:51.428\nthen you may have something happen here or\nthere.\n\n50\n00:02:51.428 --> 00:02:55.416\nYou can get in Kali since they\nexpose a rich set of APIs,\n\n51\n00:02:55.416 --> 00:03:00.987\nyou can have things deploy or things\nhappen all over the place, if you want.\n\n52\n00:03:00.987 --> 00:03:04.658\nYou could have one script running\nwith the installation happening,\n\n53\n00:03:04.658 --> 00:03:08.388\none happens when it boots up,\nanother one that triggers off of that and\n\n54\n00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:11.057\ncustomized utility and\nyou can do all this stuff.\n\n55\n00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:13.045\nJust how much effort you wanna put in,\n\n56\n00:03:13.045 --> 00:03:15.668\nthere's a rich set of tools\nhere that you can use.\n\n57\n00:03:15.668 --> 00:03:19.897\nWe're only gonna get the tip of that\niceberg, but that's enough to get you on\n\n58\n00:03:19.897 --> 00:03:22.908\nyour way towards building\nyour own custom Kali image.\n\n59\n00:03:22.908 --> 00:03:23.581\n>> Nice.\n\n60\n00:03:23.581 --> 00:03:27.117\nSo, anything in particular that\nyou like to do to yours or\n\n61\n00:03:27.117 --> 00:03:28.749\nthat we should show them?\n\n62\n00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:33.409\n>> Well, what I like to do is think about\nstuff that we said earlier this week when\n\n63\n00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:34.854\nwe were talking about.\n\n64\n00:03:34.854 --> 00:03:39.087\nIn fact, that Metasploit,\nthe updated version of it,\n\n65\n00:03:39.087 --> 00:03:42.248\nthe more powerful version isn't there.\n\n66\n00:03:42.248 --> 00:03:44.932\nIf you wanna have things\nlike an expose in there,\n\n67\n00:03:44.932 --> 00:03:48.148\nif you want to have Nessus in there,\nthose types of tools.\n\n68\n00:03:48.148 --> 00:03:51.487\nThere's tools that I use,\nthere's tools that you use and\n\n69\n00:03:51.487 --> 00:03:55.306\npen testing that you will either\ndownload from the repositories or\n\n70\n00:03:55.306 --> 00:03:58.188\ngo out to that companies website and\ndownload it.\n\n71\n00:03:58.188 --> 00:04:03.063\nIf that's the case, you could actually\ntake those packages download.\n\n72\n00:04:03.063 --> 00:04:05.958\nIn this case, it's a deb file,\na Debian file.\n\n73\n00:04:05.958 --> 00:04:10.132\nYou can download that,\nput it in this special folder,\n\n74\n00:04:10.132 --> 00:04:15.502\nwhich is a packages folder right\nunder the live directory structure.\n\n75\n00:04:15.502 --> 00:04:17.833\nAnd what happens is when\nyou run Live Build,\n\n76\n00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:20.668\nwhich is the tool used to\nactually build the ISO file,\n\n77\n00:04:20.668 --> 00:04:24.771\nit will actually grab those packages as\npart of the process and install them.\n\n78\n00:04:24.771 --> 00:04:29.771\nSo all of a sudden, you're customizing\nthis thing pretty rapidly.\n\n79\n00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:32.363\nYou've just got to remember when\nyou build that custom image.\n\n80\n00:04:32.363 --> 00:04:33.376\nGrab it, drop it in there.\n\n81\n00:04:33.376 --> 00:04:37.090\nGrab it, drop it in there and\nrock and roll.\n\n82\n00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.930\n>> I love your analogy, cuz I'm a Windows\nguy and that makes perfect sense to me.\n\n83\n00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.589\nWhen I deploy an image, then I know\nthat I'm gonna have to go back and\n\n84\n00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:46.914\ninstall Office on everybody's machine.\n\n85\n00:04:46.914 --> 00:04:49.936\nI know that I'm gonna have to go back and\ninstall a reader,\n\n86\n00:04:49.936 --> 00:04:51.984\na PDF reader on everybody's machine.\n\n87\n00:04:51.984 --> 00:04:55.869\nSo I make an image and\nI put those programs on that image.\n\n88\n00:04:55.869 --> 00:04:58.585\nNow when I deploy it,\nI don't have to do anything afterwards.\n\n89\n00:04:58.585 --> 00:05:02.816\nThe image has already got Office and\nthe PDF reader, whatever it is.\n\n90\n00:05:02.816 --> 00:05:04.538\nSo, I like that analogy.\n\n91\n00:05:04.538 --> 00:05:09.072\nCan you remove things as well or\nis it just mostly adding?\n\n92\n00:05:09.072 --> 00:05:12.481\n>> You can remove things,\nit's really up to you.\n\n93\n00:05:12.481 --> 00:05:17.286\nLike I said, you've got a rich set of\noptions here that you can use to really\n\n94\n00:05:17.286 --> 00:05:18.830\ncustomize that image.\n\n95\n00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.275\nIt's just a question of just how much\nyou want to customize that image?\n\n96\n00:05:21.275 --> 00:05:22.751\nHow much effort you want to put in?\n\n97\n00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:26.493\nYou want to change the wallpaper and stuff\nlike that, you want to take that dragon\n\n98\n00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:29.427\nout and put a real picture of\nthe Goddess Kali on there go for it.\n\n99\n00:05:29.427 --> 00:05:30.233\nYou can do it.\n\n100\n00:05:30.233 --> 00:05:30.889\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n101\n00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:37.009\nit's a pretty much nothing I would say,\nis out of reach.\n\n102\n00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.566\nIt's just a question of\ndo you really wanna put\n\n103\n00:05:39.566 --> 00:05:41.610\nthe effort in to really get it there?\n\n104\n00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.696\nSo what we do typically when we look\nat the Live Build process is the best\n\n105\n00:05:46.696 --> 00:05:52.323\nthing to do is to look at the process\nperiod without doing any customization.\n\n106\n00:05:52.323 --> 00:05:56.961\nAnd then once you've seen that, it's just\na matter of going to the next step and\n\n107\n00:05:56.961 --> 00:06:02.085\nsaying, okay, now I'm comfortable with how\nit does, cuz you do probably the toughest\n\n108\n00:06:02.085 --> 00:06:06.471\npart is setting up the whole Live Build\nstructure that does take some time.\n\n109\n00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:11.495\nDo expect there to be little kind of\nglitches that you've got to deal with,\n\n110\n00:06:11.495 --> 00:06:15.581\nyou've got to untie knots and\nstuff like that in some cases.\n\n111\n00:06:15.581 --> 00:06:16.214\nOn mine,\n\n112\n00:06:16.214 --> 00:06:21.536\nI found some libraries that had been\nupdated by another software application.\n\n113\n00:06:21.536 --> 00:06:23.641\nSo I had to grab another one and\n\n114\n00:06:23.641 --> 00:06:28.539\nput it back in place to make sure it\nworked, but it was simple things.\n\n115\n00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:32.228\nBut once you get that Live Build process\nworking, the rest of it's quite simple,\n\n116\n00:06:32.228 --> 00:06:35.344\nit's just get the packages you want\nto customize, drop it in there.\n\n117\n00:06:35.344 --> 00:06:38.517\nWanna change the wallpaper,\nokay, go to a certain folder and\n\n118\n00:06:38.517 --> 00:06:41.888\ndrop that in there and you just\nstart going right on down the list.\n\n119\n00:06:41.888 --> 00:06:42.753\n>> Fantastic.\n\n120\n00:06:42.753 --> 00:06:44.187\nWell, let's take a peek.\n\n121\n00:06:44.187 --> 00:06:47.762\n>> So what I've done to kind\nof get the ball rolling and\n\n122\n00:06:47.762 --> 00:06:53.005\nmake it more acceptable for us recording\nthis instead of having this huge,\n\n123\n00:06:53.005 --> 00:06:57.269\nhuge episode, because it does\ntake some time to set this up.\n\n124\n00:06:57.269 --> 00:07:01.625\nWhen you initially set this up,\nyou do expect for\n\n125\n00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:05.355\nit to have to download some extra things.\n\n126\n00:07:05.355 --> 00:07:08.397\nOn top of downloading stuff,\nexpecting that to compile things.\n\n127\n00:07:08.397 --> 00:07:09.593\nI thought I had to do that.\n\n128\n00:07:09.593 --> 00:07:14.403\nI found one of the libraries I had,\nthat there was actually a problem with it,\n\n129\n00:07:14.403 --> 00:07:16.112\nthe one that I was getting.\n\n130\n00:07:16.112 --> 00:07:18.818\nSo I had to go out and\ngrab the code and compile it,\n\n131\n00:07:18.818 --> 00:07:23.044\nwhich really wasn't that big of a deal,\nbut it was one more thing I had to do.\n\n132\n00:07:23.044 --> 00:07:27.274\nSo you may not have to do that, but\ndo be prepared to do some of these things.\n\n133\n00:07:27.274 --> 00:07:31.861\nNow once you run it, it's downloads these\nthings, puts it in place and says, okay,\n\n134\n00:07:31.861 --> 00:07:33.533\nnow I'm ready to do whatever.\n\n135\n00:07:33.533 --> 00:07:37.696\nNow the way you're gonna go through and\ndo this, there's actually a couple of\n\n136\n00:07:37.696 --> 00:07:42.256\ndifferent ways of looking at this process,\nit depends on how detailed you wanna get.\n\n137\n00:07:42.256 --> 00:07:46.476\nSomething that I would tell you right away\nis that there's two different sets of\n\n138\n00:07:46.476 --> 00:07:47.620\ninstructions here.\n\n139\n00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.499\nThere's a both on the docs.kali.org site.\n\n140\n00:07:50.499 --> 00:07:56.637\nSo how you much wanna get into this,\nreally kinda depends on you.\n\n141\n00:07:56.637 --> 00:08:02.262\nThis is the simple let's\nget a move on process.\n\n142\n00:08:02.262 --> 00:08:07.526\nYou just download this App, it actually\ndownload this stuff for live-build.\n\n143\n00:08:07.526 --> 00:08:11.200\nLive-build is the thing\nthat's making this happen.\n\n144\n00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.710\nLive-build is what's responsible for\n\n145\n00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.840\ngrabbing all those things and,\nput them together into a coherent package.\n\n146\n00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.330\nIt's not there by default,\nso you've gotta grab it.\n\n147\n00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.220\nIt does take some time to download.\n\n148\n00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.080\nI've already done that for us, so\nwe don't have to wait for that to happen.\n\n149\n00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.075\nThe other things you have, this is just\na nother component to the process,\n\n150\n00:08:27.075 --> 00:08:31.170\nbringing some more stuff down from\nlive bill process to support it.\n\n151\n00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:36.350\nOkay, wow once you do that, and\nyou've run all this, you'll actually\n\n152\n00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:41.625\nexpand stuff out and untar it, which is\nbasically unzipping for you Windows folks.\n\n153\n00:08:41.625 --> 00:08:43.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I do what I can.\n\n154\n00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:50.490\nSo what you have here is wherever\nyou unzip this or untard it,\n\n155\n00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:56.130\nyou'll get a folder called\nlive-build-config, which will go in there,\n\n156\n00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.070\nis you'll just run your build.sh, and\n\n157\n00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:04.940\nthat will go ahead and start the process\nof, well you have to put all of this in.\n\n158\n00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.890\nYou have to tell it you're building what\ndistribution, SANA, I want to say sauna,\n\n159\n00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:14.165\nbut I know it's not the way you pronounce\nit, I just have a feeling it isn't.\n\n160\n00:09:14.165 --> 00:09:16.225\nThat's the build name for\n\n161\n00:09:16.225 --> 00:09:20.135\nKali underneath the hood, so\nthat's what that's referring to.\n\n162\n00:09:20.135 --> 00:09:23.365\nYou don't need to put the verbose switch\nin unless you wanna see everything\n\n163\n00:09:23.365 --> 00:09:23.965\nas it goes by.\n\n164\n00:09:23.965 --> 00:09:26.285\nWho knows, maybe the first time,\nyou do wanna see that.\n\n165\n00:09:26.285 --> 00:09:28.985\nIt's not a big deal for\nme to see that anymore.\n\n166\n00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:31.515\nOnce you run that build.sh,\n\n167\n00:09:31.515 --> 00:09:37.660\nyou can walk away from the system and\ncome back later on when it's done.\n\n168\n00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:42.091\nWhat will happen is once this process is\ndone you will find underneath this live\n\n169\n00:09:42.091 --> 00:09:49.020\nbuild-configfolder, you'll find\na folder in there called builds.\n\n170\n00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:53.010\nYou'll have an ISO file in there, and\nall you have to do at that point is just\n\n171\n00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.940\ncopy it to a flash drive or wherever you\nwant and use it like any other ISO file.\n\n172\n00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.830\nYour done.\n\n173\n00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.020\nThe process takes care of it.\n\n174\n00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.040\nIt brings all that stuff together.\n\n175\n00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.640\nThe question is, what are you\ngonna do between those two points.\n\n176\n00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.640\nIt's actually quite cool.\n\n177\n00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.140\nWhat I've got here,\njust to kinda show you,\n\n178\n00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:18.250\nsince I've done the process leading up\nto that for you, what I am gonna do is,\n\n179\n00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:23.870\nI am gonna kinda show you a little bit of\nthe process, basically the end part of\n\n180\n00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:29.950\nthe process where we actually start\nsaying let's go ahead and run this.\n\n181\n00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:34.330\nJust to give you some ideas,\nand here this is what I've got,\n\n182\n00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:39.640\nhere is my live build config folder,\nif I got ahead and\n\n183\n00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:44.850\nI listed out, you can see by default it's\ngot a few things and they're not much.\n\n184\n00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:50.810\nWhat shows up in there is gonna depend\non what part of the process you're in.\n\n185\n00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:56.010\nAnd the reason why I say that, is because\nwhen you go through this build process,\n\n186\n00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:59.420\nif you just completed the build process\nthere may be additional folders in there.\n\n187\n00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.900\nWhat happens is, when you're building it,\n\n188\n00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.870\nlive build says oh you wanna build\na distribution based off Sauna?\n\n189\n00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:06.430\nOkay, fine.\n\n190\n00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:10.360\nI'm going to go out and grab all those\nfiles and put them here on this system.\n\n191\n00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.500\nAnd then I'm gonna grab any\ncustomizations that you want I'm gonna put\n\n192\n00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:15.570\nthose in there.\n\n193\n00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.290\nAnd I'm gonna compile them all\ntogether and take this and\n\n194\n00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.720\nshove it in this folder and then you\ncan come pick it up when you want.\n\n195\n00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.180\nSo that could be a lot more\nstuff showing up there.\n\n196\n00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.760\nYou could see a lot of extra files,\nand stuff like that.\n\n197\n00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.360\nI took the liberty, just to make\nthings simple, I went through and\n\n198\n00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:36.240\nran the live build command, and\nthe live-build does have a clean option.\n\n199\n00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.850\nYou can literally just go out here and\ngo live build and do clean.\n\n200\n00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.400\nAnd it will go through and clean up\neverything within that live build folder.\n\n201\n00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.270\nI'm putting that out there because that's\nsomething that you're gonna wanna remember\n\n202\n00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:51.220\nto do after you've done\na live build previously.\n\n203\n00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.250\nBecause if you're gonna do another one,\nyou want all the old garbage gone\n\n204\n00:11:55.250 --> 00:12:00.380\njust in case there isn't any sort of\ncrossovers or messes between the two.\n\n205\n00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:06.390\nSo I've already done that, that live\nbuild clean, and so we're good to go.\n\n206\n00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:10.890\nWe have a very kind of nice and\ntrim and thin folder sitting there.\n\n207\n00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.470\nSo, that's great.\n\n208\n00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:16.880\nNow once you get to the point where you\nwanna actually building something, to run\n\n209\n00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:21.710\nlive build all you gotta do is LB and then\nbuild and you should be able to hit Enter.\n\n210\n00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.470\nAnd it's gonna say, okay,\nwell let's get the process going.\n\n211\n00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:28.130\nAnd you're gonna see a lot\nof stuff just kinda go by.\n\n212\n00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:33.160\nIf you went through and\nthis is the first time you've run it,\n\n213\n00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.170\nwhich this is kind of acting like\nthe first time we have here.\n\n214\n00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:39.730\nYou may have some errors you need to\ndiagnose, sometimes you'll see in here.\n\n215\n00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.840\nThis is why it's not a bad idea to turn\non the verbose options when you're\n\n216\n00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.720\ndoing this the first time because when you\nlook through it you may actually see some\n\n217\n00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.140\nerrors pop up.\n\n218\n00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.410\nAnd then at the end you\nsee the process fail.\n\n219\n00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.210\nWell, what you can do is you can scroll\nup through that list and say okay,\n\n220\n00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.180\nwhat was it missing?\n\n221\n00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.080\nOh, these are the actual\nlibraries it's missing.\n\n222\n00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.970\nI can go get those and\nyou can bring those in.\n\n223\n00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.210\nAnd so, once you got that,\ngot all those things resolved and\n\n224\n00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:07.140\nthen run live build again,\nthen you should have a point where hey,\n\n225\n00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.600\neverything is all ready and completed.\n\n226\n00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.120\nSo that's right there what you're seeing,\n\n227\n00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.710\nthat's the actual live build\nprocess going through.\n\n228\n00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:20.130\nAnd that does take some time depending\non the system and the resources and\n\n229\n00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.470\nall that available.\n\n230\n00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:25.430\nBut while that's doing its thing, and\nwe'll say at this point all you have to do\n\n231\n00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.260\nis just pick up the ISO file at\nthe end like I was telling, is you\n\n232\n00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.240\njust go into the build folder, there's\nmy ISO file, grab it, copy it, done.\n\n233\n00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.430\nIt's all you need to do.\n\n234\n00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.920\nSo let's talk about\nthe idea of customizing.\n\n235\n00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:44.430\nSo if you need to customize this,\nthis is again on the Kali doc site.\n\n236\n00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:45.971\nThe awesomeness of live build.\n\n237\n00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:46.720\n>> [LAUGH] I love it.\n\n238\n00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.350\n>> So\nyou know it's good when they say that.\n\n239\n00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.550\nSo we got the awesomeness of live build.\n\n240\n00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.350\nWhat we have here is they're\n\n241\n00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:58.170\nshowing you just an idea here\nof how you customize this.\n\n242\n00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:03.500\nWhat this is doing here is this person\njust added in, hey we want to install some\n\n243\n00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.910\nother stuff so they created this file and\nthey told it, these are the things they\n\n244\n00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:13.080\nwant to have installed, open SSH server,\nand some sound tools and some other stuff.\n\n245\n00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.380\nThey just went through and\nRan that script, and\n\n246\n00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.090\nit's gonna tell when they create this\nscript, what's gonna happen is is that\n\n247\n00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:23.680\nit's gonna go ahead and\nstart installing these during the process.\n\n248\n00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:30.270\nSo these aren't here by default,\nthe packages are are not here by default.\n\n249\n00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:35.150\nThey just created a script, they dump\nit into a folder in there and the live\n\n250\n00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:38.330\nbuild process, when it sees that script\nwill go, oh hey there's another one,\n\n251\n00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.560\nand grab it and it will start running\nthat and downloading those tools too.\n\n252\n00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.080\nIt's actually quite neat\nto be able to do that.\n\n253\n00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.740\nAnd you can go even further,\n\n254\n00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:51.850\nthey're showing here on their site that\nif you really wanted to go to town.\n\n255\n00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.470\nYou wanna change the wallpaper.\n\n256\n00:14:54.470 --> 00:15:00.080\nThere's changing the whole process,\nchange the wallpaper, if you want.\n\n257\n00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.800\nIf you don't like that dragon image,\nyou can do that.\n\n258\n00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.230\nYou wanna install other packages,\n\n259\n00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:10.330\nthis is the one that I'd say you're\nreally interested in right here.\n\n260\n00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:14.300\nThey're using as an example.\n\n261\n00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:20.170\nAll you have to do is underneath the live\nbuild folder, so you saw the live\n\n262\n00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.430\nbuild folder with all the scripts there,\nthe build scripts and everything in there?\n\n263\n00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:27.620\nAll you have to do is make a directory,\ncall config for\n\n264\n00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:32.100\npackages and then just dump\nyour deviant files in there.\n\n265\n00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.080\nOnce you've done that,\n\n266\n00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.910\nall those things will get installed\nduring the live build process.\n\n267\n00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.990\nSo, that's pretty cool.\n\n268\n00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:42.060\nOnce you've done that and you're happy,\nall you've gotta do is run live build and\n\n269\n00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.680\nlet the thing rock and roll.\n\n270\n00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.930\nAnd it will just go ahead and\ncrank out the image.\n\n271\n00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:50.720\nLike I said, expect the image to take\nsome period of time to build, but\n\n272\n00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.140\nyou may have to do some\ntroubleshooting the first time or so.\n\n273\n00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:58.380\nAfter that, it should be able\nto just cruise right on through.\n\n274\n00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.831\nAnd to give you some ideas of some of the\nthings they've done, they ran a script,\n\n275\n00:16:02.831 --> 00:16:05.580\nthey were showing you\na little script in there with\n\n276\n00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.470\ntools they have Look at some\nother things you can do.\n\n277\n00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:09.776\nThis right here.\n\n278\n00:16:09.776 --> 00:16:14.500\nHey you want to change Kali so\nit is not using the gnome interface.\n\n279\n00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.800\nYou know those pull downs and\nstuff that we have.\n\n280\n00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:21.150\nYou could actually tell it to use KDE\nwhich is a more Windows like interface.\n\n281\n00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:25.040\nAll you have to do is\njust tell it build SH.\n\n282\n00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.500\nTell it you want to take\nthe the Kali distribution,\n\n283\n00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.870\nthe Sauna distribution, tell it you\nwant to run the variant KDE, so\n\n284\n00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.250\nyou want to switch it over to\na KDE environment, and that's it!\n\n285\n00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.191\nThat's all you need to do.\n\n286\n00:16:36.191 --> 00:16:42.220\nThe [INAUDIBLE] of course just tells\nus what's going on during the process.\n\n287\n00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.400\nSo you could actually just change the\ninterface if you don't like the interface,\n\n288\n00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.700\nchange it.\n\n289\n00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.843\nSo it's a pretty powerful tool to have.\n\n290\n00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:54.222\nSo what you're gonna have to do to\nmake the whole thing work, though,\n\n291\n00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:56.056\nis you're gonna have to go through and\n\n292\n00:16:56.056 --> 00:16:59.300\ndo that initial thing of\ndownloading the live build files.\n\n293\n00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.090\nAnd bringing those onto the system and\nthen compiling those and\n\n294\n00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:07.090\ngetting those to work and\nthen debugging it if any errors pop up.\n\n295\n00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:09.270\nLike I said they probably will but\n\n296\n00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.880\nwhen those errors pop up they're\nusually easily resolvable.\n\n297\n00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.980\nIf you see a library or\nsomething, a library or\n\n298\n00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:20.020\nsomething comes up and says, well,\nthis isn't the right version.\n\n299\n00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:20.920\nI had that happen.\n\n300\n00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.810\nI had that when I was doing this,\nthis morning doing the set up for it.\n\n301\n00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.500\nIt said, oh, this library isn't present.\n\n302\n00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.730\nWell, I looked at it,\nthat library was present.\n\n303\n00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:32.600\nWhat happened was the library it wanted\nwas a customized version for Kali so\n\n304\n00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.570\nnow I had to go out and\ngrab the one for and drop it in there.\n\n305\n00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.790\nThen all of a sudden it was happy.\n\n306\n00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:42.610\nYou know so you kind of got to be\nprepared to look at some of these,\n\n307\n00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:43.990\nlook at some of these things.\n\n308\n00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:48.120\nIf you're missing, missing libraries\none of the easiest things to do,\n\n309\n00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.490\nto try is you should be able\nto write the command line.\n\n310\n00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:56.230\nUse the command at-get and\nthen space, install and then space,\n\n311\n00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:57.860\nthe name of the library.\n\n312\n00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.620\nAnd what that will you do is if you're\nmissing it and Kali actually has it and\n\n313\n00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.190\nit is repository someplace it\nwill bring the stuff down and\n\n314\n00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.150\nput it onto the system and go from there.\n\n315\n00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:10.810\n>> Are the packages pretty easily to find,\n\n316\n00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:12.450\nlike the Nexus packages and\nthings like that?\n\n317\n00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:17.550\nDo we have to get them from Kali or\ncan we get them from anywhere?\n\n318\n00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.680\n>> No, you won't get them from Kali.\n\n319\n00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:24.860\nIf it's something that's in Kali by\ndefault then you would go through and\n\n320\n00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.320\njust create that script and\nsay grab these ones and it would know.\n\n321\n00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.690\nOh yeah.\nI have to run the at-get\n\n322\n00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:30.440\ncommand, to do that.\n\n323\n00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.370\nBecause it knows, by the fact that those\nare present and in the correct order,\n\n324\n00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.190\nthis is where it's gonna get it from.\n\n325\n00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:41.550\nIf it's something that isn't part of Kali,\nlike Nexus wouldn't be there.\n\n326\n00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:46.770\nWell then what you'd have to do is go\nto a site, download the Debian file and\n\n327\n00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:51.110\nput it in the folder we talked about\nhere and then it would pick it up.\n\n328\n00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.000\n>> So the vendor that makes the product\nyou're trying to add to your custom image,\n\n329\n00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.140\nthey would supply the dev file.\n\n330\n00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.580\n>> Yeah think of it\nthe same way you would for\n\n331\n00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.880\nWindows, if you wanna install\nlike Wireshark into Windows.\n\n332\n00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.080\nIt's not there by default.\n\n333\n00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.230\nSo, what do you do, you go to their site.\n\n334\n00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.170\nClick on it.\nDownload it.\n\n335\n00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:04.900\nIt's executable.\n\n336\n00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:06.120\nSame process.\n\n337\n00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:06.680\n>> Very good.\n\n338\n00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.630\nVery good.\n\n339\n00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:09.590\n>> All right Sean,\nwell that is great information.\n\n340\n00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:13.310\nNow, we can take our Kali imaging and\ncustomize it our heart's content.\n\n341\n00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:14.000\nWe can add things.\n\n342\n00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:14.800\nWe can move things.\n\n343\n00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.140\nWe can change default environment.\n\n344\n00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.200\nWe can change the interface.\n\n345\n00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.480\nI mean, you name.\n\n346\n00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.510\nIf we spend the time, we can change it.\n\n347\n00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.610\nAnd that's just gonna make\nit more efficient, right.\n\n348\n00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.760\nIf I can get rid of\nthe things I don't need,\n\n349\n00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.370\nadd the things that I do need, that just\nmakes it a better operating in the end.\n\n350\n00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.220\nOr more useful to me, right?\n\n351\n00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.430\n>> It absolutely does.\n\n352\n00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:40.770\nHaving the power to take a tool that's\nreally, in essence, a one-size-fits-all.\n\n353\n00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:44.730\nAnd I'm not trying to talk\nbad about Kali or anything.\n\n354\n00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:46.900\nI'm just saying it's\na one-size-fits-all tool.\n\n355\n00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.920\nWhat you see is what you get.\n\n356\n00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.830\nYou download this tool.\n\n357\n00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:55.050\nI download that tool, Mike downloads that\ntool, we're all getting the same thing.\n\n358\n00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:56.710\nBut why not customize it?\n\n359\n00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.540\nWhy not make it more to your liking?\n\n360\n00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:03.930\nAnd I wouldn't recommend that you just\nall of a sudden download Kali and say,\n\n361\n00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:04.650\nyou know what?\n\n362\n00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:08.530\nI'm gonna live build stuff because I\ndon't like the default environment.\n\n363\n00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:09.710\nWhat don't you like about it?\n\n364\n00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.960\nGet utilities, try things out,\nsee what you customize.\n\n365\n00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.250\nOnce you've got the environment\nthat you feel comfortable with and\n\n366\n00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.130\nyou like, then use Live Build to say,\n\n367\n00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:24.050\nyeah okay I want to recreate that\nenvironment and make my own ISO out of it.\n\n368\n00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.940\nAnd once you have your own ISO then\nyou can just drop it on systems.\n\n369\n00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.250\nWherever you want.\n\n370\n00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:31.280\nAnd heck, if you really want to do it,\nyou can fully script it out, so\n\n371\n00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.910\nall you gotta do is drop\nit in your CD drive or\n\n372\n00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:38.470\nplug it into your flash drive, boot off\nof it, hit enter and just walk away.\n\n373\n00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:42.190\nWhen you come back, you'll have\nKali with your user accounts and\n\n374\n00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:45.590\neverything else created and\nready to go and to be used.\n\n375\n00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:49.610\n>> All right ladies and gentlemen\nanother fantastic episode with Kali 2.0.\n\n376\n00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:50.930\nThat's gonna do it for this

00:00:15.314\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:19.935\nI'm your host Don Pezet, back again\nwith another episode of ITProTV and\n\n5\n00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:22.372\nready to jump into Kali Linux 2.0.\n\n6\n00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:24.700\nSean, what's on the table for us today?\n\n7\n00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.530\n>> Well, what we're gonna be looking\nat today, is we're gonna be looking at\n\n8\n00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.370\nanother mode of Kali that we really\nhaven't seen before in the other shows.\n\n9\n00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.886\nSo that's kind of exciting, really, so\nfeel free to get excited about that.\n\n10\n00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:40.151\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What we're looking at is we're gonna be\n\n11\n00:00:40.151 --> 00:00:42.108\nlooking at forensics mode and\n\n12\n00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:46.820\nseeing what that offers to us over\nthe normal modes that Kali offers us.\n\n13\n00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.940\nCuz we've talked about live mode,\n\n14\n00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.790\nthe persistence with running it off USB,\nwe've done all that.\n\n15\n00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.250\nWell, let's see what forensics\nmode will do for us.\n\n16\n00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.640\nAnd what we wanna do is we wanna\nstart that off by, first of all,\n\n17\n00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.300\nwhy are you gonna use forensics mode.\n\n18\n00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.280\nForensics mode, well, I guess\nthe name kind of says itself, right?\n\n19\n00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.955\n[LAUGH] You're looking for evidence.\n\n20\n00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:14.485\nSo, forensics mode is the special\nmode of Kali Linux that\n\n21\n00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:19.705\nallows you to analyze a system and\ncollect evidence.\n\n22\n00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:22.995\nTo do it in a very structured and\n\n23\n00:01:22.995 --> 00:01:26.710\nstandardized way that will\nstand up under scrutiny.\n\n24\n00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.303\nSo that means that we've got things\nthat can do memory forensics,\n\n25\n00:01:30.303 --> 00:01:34.729\nthings that can recover files, things that\ncan hash files, things that can do all\n\n26\n00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.390\nsorts of neat stuff in addition to helping\nus generate reports and stuff like that.\n\n27\n00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.760\nSo there's some really,\nreally neat stuff here.\n\n28\n00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.490\nBut the first thing we've gotta look at,\n\n29\n00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.880\nis once we know why we use it,\nis we gotta figure out how to get into it.\n\n30\n00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.420\nBecause it's not a matter of just\nstarting it up and saying, oh,\n\n31\n00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.680\nwe're in forensics mode.\n\n32\n00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.100\nNo, no,\nyou gotta do a little more than that.\n\n33\n00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.910\nSo, what I have here on my screen is,\nI have brought up inside of VMware.\n\n34\n00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.324\nTypically you're not going to do\nthis inside a virtual machine.\n\n35\n00:02:06.324 --> 00:02:10.422\nYou're gonna run this off a flash drive,\nto be quite honest.\n\n36\n00:02:10.422 --> 00:02:13.647\nBut just to make it easy to demo here and\nall that is,\n\n37\n00:02:13.647 --> 00:02:16.366\nwe're doing it inside a virtual machine.\n\n38\n00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:19.309\nSo what I have here is I have,\n\n39\n00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:24.841\nwhen I just loaded in my ISO file,\nbooted up off of it.\n\n40\n00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:28.788\nAnd I have forensics mode sitting\nthere highlighted and ready to go.\n\n41\n00:02:28.788 --> 00:02:31.064\nSo you just choose it off the list.\n\n42\n00:02:31.064 --> 00:02:32.483\nNotice it does say live,\n\n43\n00:02:32.483 --> 00:02:37.225\nso it's telling us right away that\nit's loading this right into memory.\n\n44\n00:02:37.225 --> 00:02:40.455\nSo it's not installing\nanything to the system.\n\n45\n00:02:40.455 --> 00:02:44.975\nAnd do remember that [LAUGH] you don't\nwanna touch the system, that's the thing.\n\n46\n00:02:44.975 --> 00:02:46.615\nPresumably if you're doing this,\n\n47\n00:02:46.615 --> 00:02:49.303\nyou've got a system that you\nneed to do investigation on.\n\n48\n00:02:49.303 --> 00:02:54.326\nIt's powered off and\nyou're just gonna go in,\n\n49\n00:02:54.326 --> 00:02:57.221\nload this in through a USB.\n\n50\n00:02:57.221 --> 00:03:01.944\nOr you're going to put a CD\nin the drive or a DVD,\n\n51\n00:03:01.944 --> 00:03:05.382\nwhat have you, and boot off of it.\n\n52\n00:03:05.382 --> 00:03:08.482\nAnd, so that's what we're doing,\nthat's what we're kind of emulating here.\n\n53\n00:03:08.482 --> 00:03:12.431\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead,\nI've highlighted it,\n\n54\n00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:14.600\nit starts the load process.\n\n55\n00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.197\nAnd it'll take a moment or two cuz it\nhas to get all that good stuff and\n\n56\n00:03:19.197 --> 00:03:20.579\nput it into memory.\n\n57\n00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.120\nAnd so\nwe can expect it to take a moment or two.\n\n58\n00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.050\n>> Now Sean,\nlet me ask a question real quick.\n\n59\n00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.685\nIf I had booted in a normal mode,\n\n60\n00:03:27.685 --> 00:03:30.787\nwould I still have access to\nthe same tools in forensic mode?\n\n61\n00:03:30.787 --> 00:03:33.320\nOr are there tools that are just\navailable in forensic mode?\n\n62\n00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.760\n>> That's actually a great question.\n\n63\n00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.180\nYou would have access to\nthe tools in forensics mode.\n\n64\n00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.510\nAnd you could use them\nunder certain situations.\n\n65\n00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.410\nIt's just that you really better be\ncareful, because if you're just doing\n\n66\n00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.550\nreports and stuff like that,\nthen it's probably not a big deal.\n\n67\n00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.490\nBut if you are really relying on the fact\nthat you need to collect forensically\n\n68\n00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.100\nsound evidence, I wouldn't be doing\nit from a normal installation.\n\n69\n00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.110\nUnless you happen to, for example,\n\n70\n00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.950\nbe setting up an external drive\nwith a write blocker in it.\n\n71\n00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.840\nOr you're doing something where you've\ngot a secondary drive installed on\n\n72\n00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.850\nthe system and\nyou've slaved it out as a secondary or\n\n73\n00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.040\nwhatever and blocked it that way,\nthat would be valid.\n\n74\n00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.493\nBut you really wanna make sure that\nyou're doing [LAUGH] the right way.\n\n75\n00:04:17.493 --> 00:04:18.203\n>> So forensic mode,\n\n76\n00:04:18.203 --> 00:04:21.395\nit's gonna help guarantee that we don't\nmodify any of the underlying data.\n\n77\n00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:24.140\nSo it maintains it intact for\nevidence purposes, right?\n\n78\n00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.060\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and\nthat's the name of the game.\n\n79\n00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.150\nIs because if you collect this wrong or\ndo any tweaks to it,\n\n80\n00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.850\nanything gets put out of place,\nyour case is starting to go down\n\n81\n00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.750\nthe toilet pretty quickly,\nto be blunt about the whole thing.\n\n82\n00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.810\nSo you don't want that to happen, you want\neverything to be all nice and safe and\n\n83\n00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.820\nsound and stand up to scrutiny.\n\n84\n00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.203\nSo you can see what I\nhave now on screen is,\n\n85\n00:04:46.203 --> 00:04:49.608\nyou have this Kali mode, forensic mode.\n\n86\n00:04:49.608 --> 00:04:54.430\nAnd it really looks like anything\nelse that we've done so far.\n\n87\n00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.020\nWe've looked at the Kali interface and\nall that, we've seen that.\n\n88\n00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.020\nWell, what's actually happening here\nis that it is loaded on the memory.\n\n89\n00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.860\nIf I had booted a physical\nsystem off of this,\n\n90\n00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.820\nwhat has happened is it's loaded\nthis into memory and it's left\n\n91\n00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.830\nthe actual hard drive and anything\nattached to that system as read-only.\n\n92\n00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.230\nIt will not let you tamper with it.\n\n93\n00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.650\nUnless you really jump through a lot of\nhoops and really try to mess with it,\n\n94\n00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.430\nit'll say, man you must really\nwanna monkey with evidence.\n\n95\n00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.510\nGo for it, man.\n\n96\n00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.640\nIt'll let you do it.\n\n97\n00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.360\nBut you should really\nleave it the way it is.\n\n98\n00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.630\nThey've put several safeguards in\nplace to keep you from doing that.\n\n99\n00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.680\nAnd in fact, if this was\na system that was turned off and\n\n100\n00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.990\nyou're booting off of this, you should\nhave already put a write blocker and\n\n101\n00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.250\nstuff like that in place anyway.\n\n102\n00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.832\nSo just in case you do make a mistake and\n\n103\n00:05:44.832 --> 00:05:47.917\ntry to get around that\nstuff inadvertently.\n\n104\n00:05:47.917 --> 00:05:51.618\nThat write blocker, that physical device\nis going to intercept any of that anyways.\n\n105\n00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:55.225\nSo you've got another layer of protection\nthere, which is always a good thing.\n\n106\n00:05:55.225 --> 00:05:58.215\n>> So we had the comment in the chat\nroom asking whether this was read-only.\n\n107\n00:05:58.215 --> 00:06:02.010\nSo basically in software it's made\nit read-only under the hood, but\n\n108\n00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.290\nsoftware can be overwritten, right?\n\n109\n00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.900\nSo the write blocker\nreally is the way to go.\n\n110\n00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.048\n>> Yeah, absolutely, if you don't have\na choice between either one, or if you had\n\n111\n00:06:10.048 --> 00:06:14.988\na choice, I should say, between one or\nthe other, then use a write blocker.\n\n112\n00:06:14.988 --> 00:06:18.514\nBecause you have to make a commitment\nto actually plug that thing in and\n\n113\n00:06:18.514 --> 00:06:22.370\nit's really gonna block that,\nthat's what it's designed to do.\n\n114\n00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.120\nBut if you really, really, really wanna\nget around the software, yeah, you can.\n\n115\n00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.660\nAnd you know that there's gonna be\nsomeone that's either, hopefully,\n\n116\n00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.410\nif they're someone that's\nforensically trained,\n\n117\n00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.900\nisn't gonna make that really effort\nto just beat on it and get around it.\n\n118\n00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.225\nIt's gonna be a mistake\nthat someone makes.\n\n119\n00:06:40.225 --> 00:06:44.017\nBut heck, let's just get rid\nof that mistake factor and\n\n120\n00:06:44.017 --> 00:06:49.370\nhave that write blocker there in addition\nto this so we are all safe and sound.\n\n121\n00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.702\nSo you could see I've got Kali here\nloaded and it looks completely\n\n122\n00:06:53.702 --> 00:06:58.133\nlike a normal installation of Kali,\nI can see everything on here.\n\n123\n00:06:58.133 --> 00:07:03.259\nBut if I go to my Forensics mode,\nor my Forensics menu rather,\n\n124\n00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:07.860\nyou can see it has a whole\nhost of forensic tools.\n\n125\n00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.560\nPretty much all of these we talked\nabout in some way, shape or\n\n126\n00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.750\nform in the forensics course that we did,\nso\n\n127\n00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.810\nyou've already seen some\nof these as it were.\n\n128\n00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:23.100\nBut stuff that's interesting to note,\nthey have stuff like Autopsy in here.\n\n129\n00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:28.210\nI like pointing that one out\ncuz Autopsy is a utility used\n\n130\n00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:33.100\nto help us look at what's on the drive and\nhelp us generate reports.\n\n131\n00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.240\nIt can do that in\na forensically sound manner.\n\n132\n00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.410\nThis is just one thing we can do.\n\n133\n00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.261\nNotice if I go to this web address, and\n\n134\n00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:46.360\nlet me see if I can just do a quick\ncopy and paste here for you.\n\n135\n00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.248\nOpen up Iceweasel, it's one of\nmy favorite names for a browser.\n\n136\n00:07:49.248 --> 00:07:50.885\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's Iceweasel.\n\n137\n00:07:50.885 --> 00:07:54.091\n[LAUGH]\n>> The things we get over GPL arguments\n\n138\n00:07:54.091 --> 00:07:55.609\nand stuff like that.\n\n139\n00:07:55.609 --> 00:08:00.636\n>> [LAUGH] It sounds like it should be\nthe name of a beer or something like that.\n\n140\n00:08:00.636 --> 00:08:04.471\n>> [LAUGH] So this is\n\n141\n00:08:04.471 --> 00:08:10.081\nthe autopsy tool kit.\n\n142\n00:08:10.081 --> 00:08:12.810\nIt's something that you can actually\nget on Window's too by the way.\n\n143\n00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.770\nSo don't forget that if you're\ndoing an investigation.\n\n144\n00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.100\nAnd you can see in here that you can just,\nyou know, populate it.\n\n145\n00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.050\nAnd it's designed to keep track\nof all that evidence for you, and\n\n146\n00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.810\nkeep it in a standardized format,\nwhich is great.\n\n147\n00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.990\nYou really need a tool like this when\nyou're doing a forensic investigation.\n\n148\n00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:32.080\nSo, we've got the reporting tools.\n\n149\n00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.440\nBut then, what else do we have when\nwe go through just to kind of give\n\n150\n00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.120\nit to you in passing here,\nlook at some of these other things.\n\n151\n00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.440\nWe've got tools like this DFF tool.\n\n152\n00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:49.680\nSome of these tools are designed to\nactually help you browse the drive,\n\n153\n00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.440\nto look for strings, and\nstuff like enough evidence.\n\n154\n00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.610\nI have a virtual hard drive\nback there with nothing on it,\n\n155\n00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.400\nit does take a while to load this.\n\n156\n00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.900\nRemember, this is a live installation so\nit's got to pull everything off of that\n\n157\n00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.760\nCD or flashdrive, or in this case,\nthat iso file and unload it.\n\n158\n00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.180\nSo do expect to take some time to do this.\n\n159\n00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.160\nBut this is a tool that can help you\nsearch for stuff on those drives.\n\n160\n00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.470\nAnd think about a situation like this,\nis that\n\n161\n00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:22.380\nif I had loaded this live onto a system\nthat I collected from a crime scene.\n\n162\n00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:27.970\nWhat I can do is I can turn this on or\nboot off this flash drive.\n\n163\n00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.680\nYou don't have that right\nblocker plugged in again.\n\n164\n00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:35.070\nNow I just use this and tell it,\nlook on this physical drive.\n\n165\n00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.940\nAnd I'm gonna type some strings in to\nsee if I can find any deleted stuff or\n\n166\n00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.170\nanything missing.\n\n167\n00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:44.170\nAnd see if that's something that's\nrelevant to my investigation.\n\n168\n00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:48.620\nAnd this tool will even allow you to hash\nit and say yeah, the version you found\n\n169\n00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.320\nto make sure that you can show people\nin court that the version you found\n\n170\n00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.790\nis the same version you are presenting in\ncourt, they can hash that for you too.\n\n171\n00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:01.680\nSo you're talking some reasonably\npowerful forensic tools.\n\n172\n00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.320\nThe thing you'll notice on here for\nforensics mode is,\n\n173\n00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.470\nthere are some tools clustered\nunder the forensics menu.\n\n174\n00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.660\nBut you could really use almost\nanything that Kali has available to it,\n\n175\n00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.630\nto also help you, to help you\ndo your forensic investigation.\n\n176\n00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.370\nYou know one of the things\nthat I think about is, for\n\n177\n00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:25.010\nexample Using the Metasploit framework.\n\n178\n00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.880\nThe Metasploit framework, you could\nvery well use that to go through and\n\n179\n00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.380\ndo software analysis to see if someone\ntried to slip some malware in on you or\n\n180\n00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.430\nsomething.\n\n181\n00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.670\nWe have tools that can reverse engineering\n\n182\n00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.280\nyou can use those in\naddition to Metasploit.\n\n183\n00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:46.030\nAnd those things aren't specifically\ngrouped under our forensics tab,\n\n184\n00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:46.840\nas you see.\n\n185\n00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.710\nSo we've got a bunch of things in there.\n\n186\n00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.550\nYou'll also notice there's\na lot of hashing tools in here.\n\n187\n00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:56.230\nSpecifically, we got this MD5 one used for\nhashing files.\n\n188\n00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:01.180\nRemember one of the key things we talked\nabout when we talked about forensics was,\n\n189\n00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:05.000\nit's not being able to,\njust collecting stuff.\n\n190\n00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.580\nOne of the big big big issues that people\ntend to screw up, or have issues with when\n\n191\n00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.990\nthey get into forensics is, well heck\nI know how to collect this stuff.\n\n192\n00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.060\nI know how to collect Files.\n\n193\n00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.930\nI've been doing that for\nyears, no problem.\n\n194\n00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.270\nYou know, I'm a forensics guy, and\nThe Who playing in the background,\n\n195\n00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:21.360\nlike they're awesome.\n\n196\n00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.970\nWell, the thing is is that, yeah, sure,\n\n197\n00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.450\nyou've collected files that\nhave been deleted before.\n\n198\n00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:31.040\nBut there is a difference between\ncollecting a file that's been deleted,\n\n199\n00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.860\nand making sure it's the same version\nthat someone monkeyed with, and\n\n200\n00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.700\nthat you're presenting in court.\n\n201\n00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.210\nA court's not concerned with, heck,\n\n202\n00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:42.380\nthat file that was deleted, you think it's\nthe right one, prove it's the right one.\n\n203\n00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.860\nSame thing with log files too.\n\n204\n00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.810\nYou can use this to collect log files.\n\n205\n00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.030\nYou could browse a file system,\n\n206\n00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:51.870\ncollect log files off a system, hash them,\nand then those go into evidence.\n\n207\n00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.960\nWhen you go to court and present\nthat log file they're gonna say, oh,\n\n208\n00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.210\nwell that's hearsay evidence because\nyou didn't witness it, the computer\n\n209\n00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.780\nwitnessed it, and put a line item in a\nfile telling you that that's what it was.\n\n210\n00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.460\nWell, you can say, well wait a minute.\n\n211\n00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:08.020\nI have a hash that says\nthis is more than heresay.\n\n212\n00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.770\nThis is actual legitimate\nevidence from the scene.\n\n213\n00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:11.880\nWell, that's different.\n\n214\n00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.150\nThat's best and direct evidence.\n\n215\n00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:19.140\nNow you've entered a new realm\nof trustworthiness of that data.\n\n216\n00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.800\nSo you can really do\nquite a bit with this.\n\n217\n00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.700\nSo the big thing to take away from\nforensics mode is that when you look at\n\n218\n00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:32.930\nit, it's not just a matter of well, heck,\nI just got this small amount of tools.\n\n219\n00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:37.500\nYou've got all the tools accessed in Kali\nand you can load additional ones in there.\n\n220\n00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.830\nIt's also the big important thing is,\nit doesn't\n\n221\n00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:45.500\nlet you access that drive unless you\nreally really start monkeying with things.\n\n222\n00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.990\n>> Sean, it boots up, it sets the local\nhard drive in the system, and\n\n223\n00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:51.890\nbasically is read only, so\nwe can't tamper with that.\n\n224\n00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.980\nIt runs its reports, but\nwe need to save those reports, right?\n\n225\n00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.420\nSo what do you recommend?\n\n226\n00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.599\nJust like a USB key for that?\n\n227\n00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.140\n>> That's kind of up to you.\n\n228\n00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.200\nI would have some sort of storage media.\n\n229\n00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.580\nThat's kind of your choice.\n\n230\n00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.990\nThe big important thing with prepping\nany sort of storage media, is yeah,\n\n231\n00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.410\na flash drive would totally valid to do.\n\n232\n00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.590\nIf you want to store it on a flash drive,\ngo for it.\n\n233\n00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.370\nYou want to store it on\nan external hard drive, go for it.\n\n234\n00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:20.710\nBut one of the things that is\nabsolutely essential when you do this,\n\n235\n00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:26.170\nis that if I have my flash drive, so\nI 've got a flash drive plugged in here,\n\n236\n00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:30.800\nand this flash drive happens to be the one\nI'm collecting evidence on, that's great.\n\n237\n00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.210\nThat's acceptable in court.\n\n238\n00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:38.530\nExcept if, when you wiped this from your,\nI reuse this, right?\n\n239\n00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.570\nI'm in the business of doing\nforensic investigation.\n\n240\n00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.980\nI reuse this for different cases.\n\n241\n00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.050\nLet's just say you didn't\nwipe this correctly and\n\n242\n00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.290\nthere's some remnants left over.\n\n243\n00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:49.010\nThat's gonna mess with your case.\n\n244\n00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:50.820\nYou know,\nthat's definitely gonna mess with it.\n\n245\n00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.475\nThey're gonna say you can't\neven wipe a drive correctly.\n\n246\n00:13:53.475 --> 00:13:55.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Why should I trust anything else?\n\n247\n00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.760\nAnd even if they don't really\njust drop it on you like that,\n\n248\n00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.840\nthe other question that comes into\nthe whole thing is, what's what?\n\n249\n00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.920\nWhat's from the previous case,\nor cases, I don't know, and\n\n250\n00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.530\nthe case that you're presenting me?\n\n251\n00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:11.490\nI don't really have it.\n\n252\n00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.440\nNow it may not be something that's as\nbig of an issue on a flash device, but\n\n253\n00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.460\nyou can bet if you have\na traditional drive,\n\n254\n00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.420\nthat's much easier for\nthose remnants get left behind.\n\n255\n00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:24.370\nIf you're not wiping those things\ncorrectly, you've got a big problem.\n\n256\n00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:28.610\nThat's one of the reasons why we talk\nabout, anything like this with tools.\n\n257\n00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.290\nI'll tell people,\nas far as doing forensics.\n\n258\n00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:36.130\nThe forensics process itself is actually,\nthere may be forensic techs that\n\n259\n00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:40.600\ndon't like hearing this, for the most\npart I tend to think it's pretty easy.\n\n260\n00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.450\nThe difficult part comes in when you\nhave to follow those procedures.\n\n261\n00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:50.540\nWhen we did our forensics\ncourse here the first several.\n\n262\n00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.510\nI think all the first day, as a matter of\nfact, was all covering legal procedures,\n\n263\n00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.240\nand things like that.\n\n264\n00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.980\nBecause there's specific guidelines on how\nyou can collect and store everything and\n\n265\n00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:02.780\nthings you gotta do.\n\n266\n00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:07.220\nOne of the things that was covered during\nthat course was, when you're done with\n\n267\n00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:12.270\nthe investigation, and you no longer\nhave to maintain that chain of custody,\n\n268\n00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:15.540\nyou're gonna wipe those drives and\ntag them to show they've been wiped.\n\n269\n00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.860\nSo when you put them\nback in your jump kit or\n\n270\n00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.740\nwhatever, to go out in the field\nto investigate a case,\n\n271\n00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:27.200\nyou don't reach back to your case and\npull out a drive and plug it in.\n\n272\n00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.960\nThat's got remnants of something\nleft behind cause that's gonna\n\n273\n00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.830\nmake you look like an idiot, and\nit mucks a bunch of other things.\n\n274\n00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:38.490\nSo, just keep that in mind when\nyou're doing things like this,\n\n275\n00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:43.125\nbut also you can like I said,\nyou can add to this stuff in here too.\n\n276\n00:15:43.125 --> 00:15:46.215\nSomething I would do is when you're\nadding your forensics toolkit,\n\n277\n00:15:46.215 --> 00:15:47.745\nthis is gonna be part of it.\n\n278\n00:15:47.745 --> 00:15:50.045\nYou might very well to prevent\nthese kind of problems,\n\n279\n00:15:50.045 --> 00:15:52.485\nyou might add in stuff like\na checklist and stuff like that.\n\n280\n00:15:52.485 --> 00:15:57.492\nI'm very big on that you know, when I'm\nlogging this type of stuff I'm like okay,\n\n281\n00:15:57.492 --> 00:16:01.951\nI've got a number on it or some sort\nof tag on it.- Yeah, that was wiped.\n\n282\n00:16:01.951 --> 00:16:03.443\nI'm logging everything.\n\n283\n00:16:03.443 --> 00:16:09.580\nThat's what's gonna kill most people,\nso just be prepared for that.\n\n284\n00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:14.395\nSo just FYI, some other things that you\ncan do with this just in case it does come\n\n285\n00:16:14.395 --> 00:16:19.215\nup is you do have the ability to\ndo memory forensics with this.\n\n286\n00:16:19.215 --> 00:16:22.515\nLet me see if my,\nthere's my digital forensics framework.\n\n287\n00:16:22.515 --> 00:16:26.165\nYou do have the ability to do\nmemory forensics with this.\n\n288\n00:16:26.165 --> 00:16:33.540\nSo you can potentially run some\nof the tools on a live system.\n\n289\n00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:38.240\nSo if you have a system that you can\naccess across the network or cable in on\n\n290\n00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:43.540\na crossover, with a crossover cable, you\ncan dump stuff out of memory with this.\n\n291\n00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.400\nThat's entirely possible.\n\n292\n00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.260\nBut some things I just kinda\nwanna point out, this is the DFF.\n\n293\n00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.350\nThis is the one where if I want to,\nI can say, okay, open a device and\n\n294\n00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:55.080\nchoose a drive.\n\n295\n00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.510\nWell I don't have another\ndrive connected to this.\n\n296\n00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:04.050\nBut I just have that simple,\njust went over my head.\n\n297\n00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:06.610\nVirtual drive connected\nto it that's blank.\n\n298\n00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:08.780\nI can easily go through here and\njust start searching,\n\n299\n00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.060\nputting in searches for files.\n\n300\n00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.850\nSo if there's stuff deleted on there,\nsomeone tried to pull a fast one on me and\n\n301\n00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:14.010\ndeleted stuff.\n\n302\n00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:16.790\nI can just start searching for\ndifferent file types and strings, and\n\n303\n00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:19.150\nlet it go search the file system,\nand see if it finds it.\n\n304\n00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:23.910\nIt'll actually check if the strings within\nfiles have been deleted, as well as,\n\n305\n00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.900\nother things to say, hey, someone tried to\nclear this off the drive, I've got it now.\n\n306\n00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.510\n>> And that's one of those\nwhere the larger the driver,\n\n307\n00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.200\nthe longer that it's gonna take.\n\n308\n00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.120\nI've seen those take a long time to.\n\n309\n00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.790\n>> Oh yeah, absolutely.\n\n310\n00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:39.310\nDon't expect this to go quickly.\n\n311\n00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:43.460\nPatience is definitely a virtue in this.\n\n312\n00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:49.320\nThis and ethical hacking period, you have\nto be patient If you try to force it,\n\n313\n00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.368\nin unethical hacking,\nyou're gonna get caught.\n\n314\n00:17:52.368 --> 00:17:55.710\nHere, you could destroy\nevidence in which case,\n\n315\n00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.410\neverything kind of goes down\nthe tubes at that point.\n\n316\n00:17:58.410 --> 00:17:59.460\nPeople have done that.\n\n317\n00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.530\nThat's, when Mike and\n\n318\n00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.307\nI were going the course in there,\nI can pick on him cuz he's not here.\n\n319\n00:18:06.307 --> 00:18:09.160\n[LAUGH]\nWhen Mike and I were,\n\n320\n00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:13.200\nwe had a sample crime scene, out here, set\nup when we were trying to show how to go\n\n321\n00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.550\nin and investigate a crime scene\nthat had been cordoned off.\n\n322\n00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:22.160\nIt's resisting the urge just to jump in.\n\n323\n00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.160\nMike, perfectly demonstrated one of the\nthings that people would do is go in and\n\n324\n00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.100\ngo, oh look, there's something right here.\n\n325\n00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:32.140\nIt's like, you don't do that until\neveryone's taken pictures from\n\n326\n00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.110\nall the angles and videoed it,\nand then we're gonna go in and\n\n327\n00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:39.120\nstart putting those things in bags and\nlabeling where they were and all that.\n\n328\n00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.069\nThere's a very, very big process here.\n\n329\n00:18:41.069 --> 00:18:42.970\nSo yeah, you're gonna wanna be patient.\n\n330\n00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:47.362\nAnd yeah, it can take a long time.\n\n331\n00:18:47.362 --> 00:18:52.930\nProbably not for\nsomeone that's really in a hurry to do.\n\n332\n00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:56.995\nSo a really nice, exciting mode here\nthat you could use to supplement or\n\n333\n00:18:56.995 --> 00:18:58.573\nmake part of your tool kit.\n\n334\n00:19:01.485 --> 00:19:02.310\nSo there you go.\n\n335\n00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.870\nThere's some basics with forensics mode,\n\n336\n00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.650\njust kind of because we already\ntalked about a bunch of these tools.\n\n337\n00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:13.330\nJust kinda show you how to get into it and\nthe significance of it.\n\n338\n00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.400\nI guess I'll throw in\none other thing in here,\n\n339\n00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.190\njust kinda go to talk about the last\nlittle bit of forensics mode.\n\n340\n00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:24.225\nThis would be one of the things\nthat I would probably consider\n\n341\n00:19:24.225 --> 00:19:27.755\nif I was really gonna\ndo this by the numbers.\n\n342\n00:19:27.755 --> 00:19:32.235\nI wouldn't just go ahead and load this\non a flash drive like this and say,\n\n343\n00:19:32.235 --> 00:19:36.785\nokay good here we go, here's Kali with\neverything with my forensics mode on it.\n\n344\n00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:42.350\nThe reason why I say I have a problem with\nthat, with doing something like that,\n\n345\n00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:47.310\nis because I would\nprefer just to avoid any\n\n346\n00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:53.070\nquestions of tampering or\nalterations or anything like that.\n\n347\n00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:58.400\nI want to have my kilan for forensics.\n\n348\n00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.790\nI wanna have it on its own drive.\n\n349\n00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:03.590\nI wanna see if I can get that\ndrive flagged is read only, if\n\n350\n00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:08.950\nit's feasible to do that with the tools I\nuse and say that's dedicated just to that.\n\n351\n00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:13.340\nSo in the event that I I do have to\ngo to court, or if any way shape or\n\n352\n00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:17.680\nform comes into question that this may\nnot be something that's up to snuff,\n\n353\n00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.840\nthen I wanna make sure I say okay,\nthat's the one thing I use this for.\n\n354\n00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.970\nThat was sent specifically to use this.\n\n355\n00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:27.240\nYes, I do pen testing as well with Kali.\n\n356\n00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.160\nBut, why this one can do that\n\n357\n00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.130\nI have another flash drive that\nI use specifically for that.\n\n358\n00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:38.810\nThis one goes in the box, or is wiped and\nKali is put specifically on it, just for\n\n359\n00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:41.890\nthat, each and every time,\nand that's all it's used for.\n\n360\n00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.670\nThe drive is wiped,\nnew stuff is put on it,\n\n361\n00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.520\nit's flagged as read-only and that's it.\n\n362\n00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:50.290\nIt goes in its nice little case and\ngoes to sleep until I need it again.\n\n363\n00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.520\nThat's the smart way to do this.\n\n364\n00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.812\nJust because you can use\nsomething combined for everything,\n\n365\n00:20:55.812 --> 00:20:59.620\nisn't always the best case and\nthe best thing to do in every situation.\n\n366\n00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.080\nI just don't want people questioning me,\nthat's the thing.\n\n367\n00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.120\nI do not wanna have to sit there\non the witness stand or whatever,\n\n368\n00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:10.140\nbeing the the expert or whatever there,\nhaving to get grilled by someone going.\n\n369\n00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.180\nWell, it could have been tampered.\n\n370\n00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.040\nWell, it wasn't.\n\n371\n00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.600\nBut it could have been.\n\n372\n00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.070\nAnd you just want to,\nyou know, no it couldn't have.\n\n373\n00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:19.570\nYou don't want to have\nthat called into question.\n\n374\n00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.825\nYou wanna have Have it so\nthis is all this does.\n\n375\n00:21:21.825 --> 00:21:23.775\nYeah, I did do pen testing on that job,\ntoo,\n\n376\n00:21:23.775 --> 00:21:28.835\nwhen I stumbled across this crime scene,\nand I switched that stuff out for this.\n\n377\n00:21:28.835 --> 00:21:32.505\n>> Now, I know we all love to use\nthe USB keys cuz they boot fast and\n\n378\n00:21:32.505 --> 00:21:34.105\nthey're cheap now.\n\n379\n00:21:34.105 --> 00:21:37.985\nBut a DVD would be suitable also\ncuz we've run into that, that helps\n\n380\n00:21:37.985 --> 00:21:42.600\na little bit cuz you use a DVD-R,\nyou write it once and you go from there.\n\n381\n00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.130\nBut for saving the logs,\nI know I mentioned that earlier and said,\n\n382\n00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:47.915\nwell we'll save that to a usb key, and you\nmentioned that it might not be writeable.\n\n383\n00:21:47.915 --> 00:21:50.230\nCan we burn DVD's from\ninside a Kali Linux?\n\n384\n00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:53.070\n>> Yeah, you can add stuff in there and\ndo that.\n\n385\n00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:58.260\nThe thing I have with that,\nand we have to remember,\n\n386\n00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:03.860\nis think about, you work with hardware and\nsoftware just like I do.\n\n387\n00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:08.960\nThink about it, when you, the thing\nyou have, if you have to plug a DVD\n\n388\n00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:14.130\ninto a system, let's say you\nneed to write something out and\n\n389\n00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:20.060\nyou have to plug equipment in to do that,\na flash drive or what have you.\n\n390\n00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.460\nThink about the fact that plugging that\nin does make a change to the system,\n\n391\n00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:28.250\nso we wanna be very,\nvery careful with that.\n\n392\n00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:31.970\nThat's probably the big plus we have\nwith the flash drive is a flash drive,\n\n393\n00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:34.740\nwe're booting off of it,\nwe can collect it and put it on there.\n\n394\n00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.820\nIf we try to plug anything else in and\n\n395\n00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:40.090\nwe could potentially be altering\nsettings on the system.\n\n396\n00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:44.555\nAnd while that's not a bad thing, it just\nIt just means it's something that if you\n\n397\n00:22:44.555 --> 00:22:49.475\ndo bring in like an external DVD drive or\nyou do plug in another flash drive.\n\n398\n00:22:49.475 --> 00:22:52.155\nIt's something that you better be able to\nlook at and say yeah, there's a serial\n\n399\n00:22:52.155 --> 00:22:55.805\nnumber on here or know what the device\nID and all that is on there.\n\n400\n00:22:55.805 --> 00:22:59.385\nSo if it shows up anywhere on that\nsystem in any other of your other logs,\n\n401\n00:22:59.385 --> 00:23:01.375\nyou can specifically account for it.\n\n402\n00:23:01.375 --> 00:23:04.330\nThey say well what's this number here or\nwhy is this here.\n\n403\n00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:07.560\nIt's like oh well that's my device and\nthis is a picture of the device and\n\n404\n00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.100\nthis is the device in a bag right here.\n\n405\n00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.400\nSo that's my stuff, it's preserved.\n\n406\n00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.650\nYou're free to check it out and\n\n407\n00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:17.350\ndo whatever you want to make\nyou feel comfortable with it.\n\n408\n00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:20.640\nThat's the type of things\nyou gotta worry about.\n\n409\n00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:25.240\nI also think about,\nI tend to prefer having a DVD\n\n410\n00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:30.070\nto do this off of because I can have\na DVD and can make it read only.\n\n411\n00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:33.550\nAnd this, people are still always\nconcerned that you can write to it.\n\n412\n00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:34.940\nDVD, I flag it as read only.\n\n413\n00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.860\nIt's done.\nThat's it, it's closed.\n\n414\n00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:41.490\nSo that sounds great, but\nthen I think about how\n\n415\n00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:44.790\nmany machines still nowadays have those\noptical drives starting to go away.\n\n416\n00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:48.480\nAnd so now the next thing is that I have\nto bring that stuff and plug one of those\n\n417\n00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:53.320\ndrives in, and now I've altered the scene\nsomeway that I have to account for.\n\n418\n00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.520\nSo gotta take the good with the bad.\n\n419\n00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.800\n>> Ben in the chat room\nhad a question about,\n\n420\n00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.610\nwhat if I've got a machine\nthat we've preimaged.\n\n421\n00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:06.280\nSo he suggested like if he's\nused Encase or the FDK.\n\n422\n00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.060\nTo go ahead and pre-image it,\ncould you use that?\n\n423\n00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:13.030\nI guess it would be kinda hard to use\nthe forensics mode with that, right?\n\n424\n00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:16.080\nYou'd have to maybe mount both to\na virtual machine, or something.\n\n425\n00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.500\n>> If you, yeah, you could do it that way.\n\n426\n00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.450\nIf you had an image of a system, and\nthere's someway you can mount it and\n\n427\n00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.360\nbrowse it, cuz you obviously\ncan do it with some images.\n\n428\n00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:28.180\nThen, yeah, you'd have to- you could\nmatch it in a virtual machine and\n\n429\n00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.130\nsomehow flag it as read only in there,\nand then go through and\n\n430\n00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:32.830\ndo your analysis right through Kali.\n\n431\n00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:34.970\nSo yeah, you could do that.\n\n432\n00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:40.400\nAgain, it's something that if you think\nyou're ever gonna have to do that or\n\n433\n00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.870\nyou do run into that\nsituation I would probably\n\n434\n00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:47.400\nleave it until I'm absolutely sure\non the best way to handle it.\n\n435\n00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.980\nLeave that machine in the state it's\nin and then do a couple quick tests and\n\n436\n00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:54.750\nresearch to figure out the best way\nto go through and leave that so\n\n437\n00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:56.280\nit's not tampered with.\n\n438\n00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.010\nAnd then what you're gonna do is you're\ngoing to remember we're not going to\n\n439\n00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:01.380\nanalyze that image.\n\n440\n00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.550\nI don't care if you've got\nan image of a system and\n\n441\n00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:05.820\nyou're gonna analyze that image.\n\n442\n00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:09.090\nYou're gonna wanna make an image of that.\n\n443\n00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:13.860\nNow if that image was of a system that\nwas a live system some place, and you\n\n444\n00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:17.700\nimaged that, and now you're analyzing it\nwith Kali, then that's a different matter.\n\n445\n00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.300\nYou would mount it in\nthe same virtual system.\n\n446\n00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.060\nIt all depends on where\nthe source of the image is.\n\n447\n00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:26.150\nSometimes they have an image\nof a system which itself\n\n448\n00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:30.250\nwas where the actual crime is concealed\nin which case you'd make a copy of that.\n\n449\n00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:31.780\nIf it was a physical system and\n\n450\n00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:36.420\nyou image that,\nbasically you image that system twice and\n\n451\n00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:40.590\nthen that system get's tagged and\nbagged and put into evidence some place.\n\n452\n00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:43.990\nAnd then you can do all your work\non your images from that point.\n\n453\n00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:45.440\nHow you do your work on em?\n\n454\n00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.520\nIt could be as simple as,\nyou know, Don was saying.\n\n455\n00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.090\nYou mount them somehow,\nin a virtual machine.\n\n456\n00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:53.920\nIf it's on an optical drive,\nyou pop the optical drive in and and\n\n457\n00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.540\nanalyze the image that way.\n\n458\n00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.400\nSo you have options at that point.\n\n459\n00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.270\nJust please remember, do not tamper\nwith the original, that's a big mistake,\n\n460\n00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:02.970\nis that, oh just go mess with it.\n\n461\n00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:04.100\nNo no.\n\n462\n00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:05.840\nRed flag all over the place on that one.\n\n463\n00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.810\nDon't ever do that.\n\n464\n00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:08.860\n>> Awesome.\n\n465\n00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:09.640\nWell Shawn.\n\n466\n00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.160\nWe covered a lot of stuff in this episode,\nright.\n\n467\n00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.140\nYou showed us how to get into\nforensics mode first and\n\n468\n00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.220\nkind of when we would use it.\n\n469\n00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:17.430\nWe got a chance to see some of the tools\nthat were available in forensics mode.\n\n470\n00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:21.650\nAnd then we got the very important warning\nof insuring that, even though forensic\n\n471\n00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:25.080\nmode is gonna put us in software read\nonly mode, there's still that risk.\n\n472\n00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.980\nAnd so it's always better to have a\nhardware write blocker in there in place,\n\n473\n00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.020\nso keep that in mind.\n\n474\n00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.180\nBut do you have anything else you\nwanna throw in, or is that about it?\n\n475\n00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:35.800\n>> I just wanted to emphasize one\nlast little point is that the purpose\n\n476\n00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.035\nof this was to show you how to\nget into forensics mode and\n\n477\n00:26:38.035 --> 00:26:41.210\nthe benefits of using it\nover just regular Kali mode.\n\n478\n00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:44.100\nIf you're interested in going through\nthe whole forensic process and\n\n479\n00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.510\nwe have the digital forensic investigator\ncourse here in the ITPro library\n\n480\n00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:51.470\nwhere you really do that in style and\n\n481\n00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:55.940\neverything I guess is the way to put it,\n[LAUGH] we cover it in depth.\n\n482\n00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.880\nDoing a forensics overview is\nabout as much as we can do here\n\n483\n00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.020\nbecause I don't want you\nto look at the process and\n\n484\n00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:05.730\nsay from just a simple half hour oh,\nokay, I know how to do it.\n\n485\n00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:08.645\nNo, no, no, go look at other stuff first,\nand then [LAUGH].\n\n486\n00:27:08.645 --> 00:27:11.010\nSo that's what the purpose of this was.\n\n487\n00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:12.202\n>> Excellent, excellent.\n\n488\n00:27:12.202 --> 00:27:15.050\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen\nout there in TV land, that is our show!\n\n489\n00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:16.380\nI hope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n490\n00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.560\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Don Pezet.\n\n491\n00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.980\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n492\n00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.604\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n493\n00:27:21.604 --> 00:27:22.104\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.060\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.100\nAnd Sean in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.320\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\none of our favorite tools, Nmap.\n\n6\n00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.740\nBut we're gonna be stepping it up a notch.\n\n7\n00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.290\nWe're gonna take Nmap to the extreme.\n\n8\n00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.930\nRight Sean?\n\n9\n00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:29.820\n>> Yeah, so.\n\n10\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.100\nWe're gonna be doing something\nentirely different with Nmap now.\n\n11\n00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.470\nOr, entirely different but the same.\n\n12\n00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.557\nI guess is the way to do it.\n\n13\n00:00:35.557 --> 00:00:37.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because I don't want to make it easy\n\n14\n00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.540\nfor you to understand.\n\n15\n00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.920\n>> Begin with that double speed.\n\n16\n00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.650\n>> So, hey.\n\n17\n00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.590\n[LAUGH] We're professionals here.\n\n18\n00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.640\nAt this point it's probably safe to say\n\n19\n00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.530\nmost people watching this\nknow what Nmap actually is.\n\n20\n00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.210\nIt's just a port scanner.\n\n21\n00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.472\nIt helps do network reconnaissance and\nall that good stuff.\n\n22\n00:00:56.472 --> 00:01:00.290\nWell, we don't need to go\nover that ground again.\n\n23\n00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.040\nSo when you hear that we're looking\nat Nmap again, yeah we are.\n\n24\n00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.600\nAnd Nmap is involved in this discussion\nbut we're changing the nature of the beast\n\n25\n00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.820\na bit and saying okay, we're gonna involve\nNmap in the discussion but we're gonna\n\n26\n00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.320\nyou know, kick it up several notches\npast beyond what we've already done.\n\n27\n00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.340\nIn fact, all the stuff that we've done in\nthe past, you can actually use with what\n\n28\n00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.700\nI'm gonna show you today in\nthe demos we have set up here.\n\n29\n00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.960\nSo what we're doing is,\n\n30\n00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.260\nwe're moving over something called DNmaps-\n>> Bam.\n\n31\n00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.744\n>> Nmap with a D in front of it, yeah bam.\n\n32\n00:01:32.744 --> 00:01:34.347\n[LAUGH]\n>> Those should kick it up a notch.\n\n33\n00:01:34.347 --> 00:01:37.040\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, there you go.\n\n34\n00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.660\nWhat's happening here is,\nthe software dnmap is used\n\n35\n00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.260\nto leverage the regular Nmap tool but\ninstead of just using a single\n\n36\n00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.090\ninstance of Nmap, now we're opening up and\ndistributing across multiple systems.\n\n37\n00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.730\nSo what we're doing is Nmap on all these\ndifferent systems out here is gonna be\n\n38\n00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.670\nfired up and gonna be centrally\ncontrolled, so now instead of just one\n\n39\n00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.200\nsystem doing a scan it's gonna be multiple\nsystems doing a scan on our behalf.\n\n40\n00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.290\nAnd you can imagine the speed and\nperformance with it also.\n\n41\n00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.560\nThere's a potential for abuse here,\nwhich we'll get to, [LAUGH] cuz come on,\n\n42\n00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.060\nwe gotta talk about that.\n\n43\n00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.510\nSo, but it's got a lot of benefits.\n\n44\n00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.420\nIt not only, like I said,\nnot only does it make the scans faster,\n\n45\n00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.150\nit adds more flexibility to you.\n\n46\n00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.200\nIt gives you the ability\nto run just you know,\n\n47\n00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.130\nall these different variations of scans.\n\n48\n00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.640\nSo all the stuff we talked about in the\npast, like running special NSE scripts,\n\n49\n00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.130\nthe Nmap Scripting Engine.\n\n50\n00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.480\nRunning those things for\npassword cracking and stuff like that.\n\n51\n00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.230\nWe can use those, we can use all\nthe other switches that we've had before.\n\n52\n00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.340\nAnd we can just keep going and\ngoing and going and scaling this up.\n\n53\n00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.230\nSo, tremendous, you know, power here that\n\n54\n00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.360\nyou've got at your fingertips\nby using DNmap to run Nmap.\n\n55\n00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.880\nSo DNmap is its own program, or\n\n56\n00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.099\nit's just special commands\nwe're using with existing Nmap?\n\n57\n00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.204\nIt's actually really it's own program, but\n\n58\n00:03:08.204 --> 00:03:13.762\nit's feeding commands into Nmap,\nso at the end of the day, DNmap,\n\n59\n00:03:13.762 --> 00:03:19.046\nyes is its own program, but\ndoes not work without Nmap present.\n\n60\n00:03:19.046 --> 00:03:23.551\nSo what you will be doing is is that\nyou'll have Nmap installed on all\n\n61\n00:03:23.551 --> 00:03:28.293\nyour client systems and then you'll\nhave the DNmap client as well, and\n\n62\n00:03:28.293 --> 00:03:31.970\nthen the DNmap server\ninstalled someplace else.\n\n63\n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.310\nSo you have to have those components.\n\n64\n00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.110\nAnd what will happen is that you'll\ngo into the DNmap server first and\n\n65\n00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.930\nyou'll configure that and\nget that ready to go and you'll tell it\n\n66\n00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.600\nwhat it's going to be doing as part of\nyour command and control type system.\n\n67\n00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.860\nAnd then your client systems what you'll\ndo there is you'll start up the DNmap\n\n68\n00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.870\nclient and you'll tell it,\n\"Hey where is the DNmap server?\" And\n\n69\n00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.790\nit will go and connect to that server and\nstart pulling down the commands and\n\n70\n00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.600\nthen spoon feeding those over\ninto the actual Nmap client.\n\n71\n00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.666\nSo Nmap on it's own can't\nreally do what DNmap's doing.\n\n72\n00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:10.900\nDNmap has to be there and\n\n73\n00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.770\nthen Nmap has to be there because DNmap\nwon't do the scans for you either.\n\n74\n00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.200\nDNmap is just acting as the client server.\n\n75\n00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.800\nIt acts as one place where I'm storing\nthe commands and doing all the control and\n\n76\n00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.220\ngenerating the reports.\n\n77\n00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.020\nAnd then it has something else that's\nactually gonna pull the commands down from\n\n78\n00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.390\nthere and feed it over to Nmap and\n\n79\n00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.580\nthen report those back as it\ngoes through the process.\n\n80\n00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.120\n>> So it's really like your normal,\n\n81\n00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.650\nlike we think of with any\ntype of distributed attack.\n\n82\n00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.276\nEven though this technically isn't an\nattack, where I've got that field general\n\n83\n00:04:38.276 --> 00:04:41.227\nwhich is your DNmap server that\nwe're gonna send the commands to and\n\n84\n00:04:41.227 --> 00:04:44.030\nthen he's gonna distribute\nit out to all the bots.\n\n85\n00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.650\nIn this case they're actual\nNmap clients that are running.\n\n86\n00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.580\n>> Yeah.\nThat's a good way to look at it.\n\n87\n00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.680\nAs a matter of fact, you [LAUGH]\ncan use it if you really wanted to.\n\n88\n00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.570\nThat's why you gotta be careful with this.\n\n89\n00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.140\nIs you know,\nwhat you're saying is, you know,\n\n90\n00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.770\nyou're going to task multiple systems with\ngoing out and scanning various targets.\n\n91\n00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.160\nIf that's the case, the potential for\nyou to abuse this by scaling it up and\n\n92\n00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.610\nrunning various attacks,\n\n93\n00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.150\nyou could do a create your own\ndistributed denial service with this.\n\n94\n00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.100\nYou know, so you really wanna be careful\nwith it, but that also is something to be\n\n95\n00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.680\naware of is that if you think you're gonna\nget cute and use this to do something\n\n96\n00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.230\nlike that, be aware that it's easily\ntraceable back with something like this.\n\n97\n00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.370\nThis isn't designed to be stealthy.\n\n98\n00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.830\n>> Stealth mode.\n\n99\n00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:30.580\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's\n\n100\n00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.570\nnot really designed to hide itself.\n\n101\n00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:39.320\nSo you can adjust the scans in Nmap to\nbe more stealthy, but still someone\n\n102\n00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.760\ncould track it back with some degree of\neffort, but they could track it back.\n\n103\n00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.710\nBu we're counting on the fact that if\nyou're going to run a distributed analysis\n\n104\n00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.780\nservice as a pen tester, you've got other\ntools that are better suited for that,\n\n105\n00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.710\nwhich there are plenty tools\nthat are better suited for this.\n\n106\n00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.936\nThis one, the main concern is is that\nsince you could emulate what a true\n\n107\n00:06:02.936 --> 00:06:07.100\ndistribute denial of service,\nyou're gonna wanna be very careful.\n\n108\n00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.660\nBecause if you use this the wrong way and\nreally kinda throttle it up,\n\n109\n00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.992\nyou could beat the living\nheck out of a system.\n\n110\n00:06:12.992 --> 00:06:14.976\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And just take it down to its knees and\n\n111\n00:06:14.976 --> 00:06:15.782\nshut it down.\n\n112\n00:06:15.782 --> 00:06:18.670\nSo remember that when you're doing this.\n\n113\n00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.210\n>> So it's really that, again,\n\n114\n00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.820\nit's not meant to be a denial\nof service attack thing.\n\n115\n00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.330\nIt could be used that way.\n\n116\n00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.220\nSo then the advantage of using DNmap\n\n117\n00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.670\nis being able scan maybe a larger number\nof machines in a shorter amount of time.\n\n118\n00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.330\nBecause I can do the same\nthing using Nmap, but\n\n119\n00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.770\nif I'm scanning hundreds of\nmachines that could take some time.\n\n120\n00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.220\nBut if I get 10, 20, 50 machines doing\nthis scan I could scan the same amount\n\n121\n00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.580\nof machines in a much\nshorter period of time.\n\n122\n00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.090\n>> Yes.\n\n123\n00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.600\nAnd, and in fact you hit really\nthe nail on the head of why\n\n124\n00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.800\nyou would want to use something like,\nlike DNmap.\n\n125\n00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.930\nOne of the problems with Nmap,\n\n126\n00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.590\nNmap is a very powerful,\nvery flexible tool for us.\n\n127\n00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.170\nWe've seen that over and over again.\n\n128\n00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.610\nEvery time we've seen Nmap\nup to this point we've\n\n129\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.620\ndone something additional with it.\n\n130\n00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.000\nWe started out way back in the ethical\nhacking course with using it\n\n131\n00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.040\njust as a port scanner which most people\nhave come to know and love it as.\n\n132\n00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.820\nBut it wasn't too long after that, in\nfact, the last time we looked at Kali and\n\n133\n00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.350\nwere monkeying around stuff that time,\nwe showed how you can run this\n\n134\n00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.810\nscripting engine and start feeding\npassword cracking, and looking for\n\n135\n00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.810\nspecific vulnerabilities on systems to\nuse as a crude vulnerability scanner.\n\n136\n00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.690\nAs well as other things, so\nwe really stepped it up.\n\n137\n00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.931\nBut Nmap does have some drawbacks.\n\n138\n00:07:39.931 --> 00:07:44.954\nLike I said, Mike, you hit the nail\non the head there is that if you're\n\n139\n00:07:44.954 --> 00:07:49.978\nscanning large amounts of hosts and\ngoing across all these subnets and\n\n140\n00:07:49.978 --> 00:07:54.066\nall that, you could really\nsuffer from some slow downs or\n\n141\n00:07:54.066 --> 00:07:59.347\nperformance problems here Even though\nNMap is fast, if you start feeding\n\n142\n00:07:59.347 --> 00:08:04.570\nall these hosts it doesn't perform\nas fast as some other scanners will.\n\n143\n00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:05.830\nThere are other scanners out there.\n\n144\n00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.900\nOne of the ones they mention, there's\nanother one that someone made called ZMap,\n\n145\n00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.830\nwhich does the same type\nof stuff that NMap does.\n\n146\n00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:18.770\nBut what the person did is they wrote it\nin such a way that it doesn't keep track,\n\n147\n00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:22.370\ndoesn't really do the stateful\ntype scanning that NMap does.\n\n148\n00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.490\nNMap's big draw back is that,\nif you scan a large number of hosts,\n\n149\n00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:30.030\nit's actually keeping track of all\nthose connections as it goes back and\n\n150\n00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.080\nforth, in some way shape or form.\n\n151\n00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.810\nIf it has to keep track of a lot of\nthose things, it results in a slow down.\n\n152\n00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:38.980\nYou know, there's more overhead.\n\n153\n00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.470\nZMap and\nthings like that do simple ping sweeps.\n\n154\n00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.930\nWe talked about Angry IP back\nin the ethical hacking class.\n\n155\n00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.520\nThey don't suffer from that because\nthey do not keep track of those things.\n\n156\n00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:55.240\nSo what's happening here is instead\nof just ditching NMap, we can speed\n\n157\n00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.900\nup the scans for breaking them up and\nhanding them off to multiple NMap clients.\n\n158\n00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.890\nAnd now we can scan those large range of\naddresses, in a much more efficient and\n\n159\n00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.500\neffective manner, so\nthat would be the big,\n\n160\n00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.590\nbig benefit with something like this\nis that many hands make for light work.\n\n161\n00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.090\nYou distribute across multiple NMap\nsystems and it just keeps going and\n\n162\n00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.540\ngoing and going and going and going.\n\n163\n00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:17.120\n>> Fantastic.\n\n164\n00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.600\nAll right, well let's take a look at it.\n\n165\n00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.590\nI'm dying to see it.\n\n166\n00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:24.470\n>> Yeah, let's go in and take a look\nat what DNmap actually looks like.\n\n167\n00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.360\nYou know.\nI'm not gonna worry too much in\n\n168\n00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.690\nthis demo about showing you NMap.\n\n169\n00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:34.420\nLike I said, they'll be some NMap commands\nhere, but I'm not gonna worry about\n\n170\n00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.720\nactually going through the whole thing\nwith NMap and all the various commands.\n\n171\n00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.483\nIf you wanna go through that I'll let\nyou go back to the ethical hacking or\n\n172\n00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:48.109\nprior Kali discussion and Kali 1.0.\n\n173\n00:09:48.109 --> 00:09:54.890\nWell, to start the actual DNmap stuff,\nit's actually on our list here.\n\n174\n00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:58.690\nIf we go through and we look for it, you\ncan see right here, information gather,\n\n175\n00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:02.290\nand it's got the DNclient and\nDNmap Server.\n\n176\n00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.485\nOkay?\nDo not start NMap as part of this.\n\n177\n00:10:05.485 --> 00:10:08.160\nNMap is its own thing.\n\n178\n00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.300\nLet DNmap take care of that.\n\n179\n00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.840\nIf you need to do anything with NMap at\nthis point, it's because you are trying to\n\n180\n00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.690\ncheck to see if you got the right scan or\ncheck a couple switches.\n\n181\n00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.710\nThat's about where I can\nsee you doing things.\n\n182\n00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:25.240\nBut after you've got an idea what\nscan you wanna run, you're good.\n\n183\n00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.360\nWhat you're gonna be doing is,\nyou've gotta do some set up for this.\n\n184\n00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.500\nThis is a command line tool.\n\n185\n00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:34.160\nWhat you have to decide is what's\ngonna be the DNMap client,\n\n186\n00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.410\nwhich one's gonna be the DNMap server?\n\n187\n00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:41.210\nSo I, to make it easy here for\nus, and easy to follow.\n\n188\n00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.110\nI have two virtual systems.\n\n189\n00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.920\nI have Kali 2 and Kali 2A.\n\n190\n00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.237\nApparently was really creative today.\n\n191\n00:10:47.237 --> 00:10:48.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n192\n00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.730\nthat's what you come up\nwith before breakfast.\n\n193\n00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.510\nKali 2, which is this current system,\n\n194\n00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.770\nis going to be my server, and\nKali 2A is going to be my client.\n\n195\n00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:06.520\nOkay so, what I'm gonna start off\nwith is I am going to set stuff up on\n\n196\n00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:11.490\nthis server system and the way I do that\nis here's the DNmap server, you just start\n\n197\n00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:16.710\nthat up and it launches this terminal on\nhere saying what do you want me to do?\n\n198\n00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:21.520\nWell, I look on here and\nit's telling me the options.\n\n199\n00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.420\nJust to give you some idea of some\nthings that have to take place,\n\n200\n00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:30.470\nyou can see you're going to run DNmap\nserver, and you just type in that command.\n\n201\n00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:34.100\nRemember DNmap_server,\ndon't type in DNmap,\n\n202\n00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.700\ncuz that's gonna cause\nall sorts of errors.\n\n203\n00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:41.960\nBut things that we have to define, you can\nsee that it's got, you have to know your\n\n204\n00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.665\nport, and you've gotta know the IP,\nyou've gotta know the port first of all.\n\n205\n00:11:46.665 --> 00:11:49.260\nThat you're gonna be listening on for\nrequests,\n\n206\n00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.520\ncuz a server is gonna have requests\ncome in from the client, so\n\n207\n00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.800\nwhat you wanna take note of first of\nall is what port you're gonna put in.\n\n208\n00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.980\nIt's up to you,\nyou can put whatever port in you want.\n\n209\n00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.230\nJust make sure that if you've\ngot a firewall in the way,\n\n210\n00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:04.760\nyou're passing that traffic, so\nyou could choose whatever port you want.\n\n211\n00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.810\nAlso make a note of your IP address.\n\n212\n00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.840\nYou won't put your IP address\nin here cause this guy isn't\n\n213\n00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.140\ncalling out for anybody.\n\n214\n00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.900\nYou know, you're coming here,\nI'm not calling out.\n\n215\n00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.620\nI don't need to where to go or\nanything else.\n\n216\n00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.725\nI'll to you where to go if you ask,\nyou know?\n\n217\n00:12:16.725 --> 00:12:19.020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But what you're gonna do is,\n\n218\n00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:24.890\nyou have set a port, but there's also\nsomething else you gotta set too.\n\n219\n00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:30.680\nThat is the actual, when you look here\nyou see this minus f switch right here.\n\n220\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.560\nThe NMap commands file.\n\n221\n00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.400\nThat's really one of the big\nimportant things here.\n\n222\n00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.420\nIf you don't create that,\nit's a simple text file.\n\n223\n00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:43.000\nIf you don't create that,\nthis process fails.\n\n224\n00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.930\nSo you pretty much tell from it saying\nminus F equals NMap commands files,\n\n225\n00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:52.260\nyou pretty much guess what it does but\nlet's see what's actually in there.\n\n226\n00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:57.200\nTo make things simple for us I have taken\nthe liberty of already setting one up,\n\n227\n00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.310\nand this is my NMap.txt.\n\n228\n00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.770\nIt's just a simple text file.\n\n229\n00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:01.940\nThat's all it is.\n\n230\n00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.490\nThere's no significance\nto it being named NMap.\n\n231\n00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.760\nI just named it that,\nbecause it made sense.\n\n232\n00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.819\nAnd it's easy to track,\nand all that good stuff.\n\n233\n00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.210\nIf I open up this text file and\ntake a look at what it has,\n\n234\n00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.760\nit's just got NMap commands in there.\n\n235\n00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.020\nThat's all it's got, okay?\n\n236\n00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.680\nSo what you will do is the NMap\ncommands that you want to run,\n\n237\n00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.100\njust like you'd go to\nthe normal commandline in NMap,\n\n238\n00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.930\nyou'll just pop these thing in\nhere line after line after line,\n\n239\n00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:33.010\nwhatever switches you want as long as\nNMap understand it, you can do it.\n\n240\n00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.960\nYou can actually put your scripting\nin a command center too if you want.\n\n241\n00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:39.260\nSo if you want to do those vulnerability\nscans and look for passwords and\n\n242\n00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.590\nstuff like that and all,\ngo ahead put them in here,\n\n243\n00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:46.540\nas long as those things are something\nthe NMap clients have present or\n\n244\n00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.000\nNMap has built in by\ndefault it's gonna use it.\n\n245\n00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.940\n>> So, it's really basically instead\nof going to the NMap interface on\n\n246\n00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.950\neach individual machine, we're just\nputting those commands in a text file.\n\n247\n00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:02.210\nWe're gonna distribute the commands\nto multiple instances of NMap\n\n248\n00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.030\nusing this DNmap server.\n\n249\n00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.020\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n250\n00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.140\n>> Perfect, so whatever I can type\nin from NMap, I can type in here.\n\n251\n00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.590\n>> Exactly that's all you gotta remember.\n\n252\n00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.020\nAnd that's great because there's,\nand there's really,\n\n253\n00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.590\nyou saw there's a small number of\ncommands for the DNmap server.\n\n254\n00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:18.100\nThat's it.\n\n255\n00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.970\nThere's no other fancy commands or\n\n256\n00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.390\nreally any hidden commands\nin there you gotta use.\n\n257\n00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:23.890\nThat's it.\n>> And you might have some custom\n\n258\n00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:25.980\nscan that you've taken\nthe time to develop or\n\n259\n00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.860\nsome script that you\nuse with NMap already.\n\n260\n00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.590\nAnd developed it over time, perfected it.\n\n261\n00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:33.370\nAnd instead of having to start over,\nI can just grab that and\n\n262\n00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.810\nbring it in here,\nnow distribute it out to many MF clients.\n\n263\n00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:37.380\n>> Exactly.\n\n264\n00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:37.980\n>> Nice.\n\n265\n00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:43.620\n>> Do remember though,\nyou brought up the idea of doing a script.\n\n266\n00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.760\nThere are some scripts built in to NMap.\n\n267\n00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:51.950\nThere was a whole bunch of them as we\nsaw in one of our previous episodes.\n\n268\n00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.530\nThere's a whole bunch of them in there.\n\n269\n00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:58.130\nIf you do create something custom develop,\nthis won't distribute the script out.\n\n270\n00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:00.520\nYou'll have to make sure that\nscript is copied to those systems.\n\n271\n00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.090\nWhat you've got there.\n\n272\n00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:02.262\n>> It's gonna look locally to run.\n\n273\n00:15:02.262 --> 00:15:04.893\nYou can tell it what script to run, but\nit's look locally to find the script, so\n\n274\n00:15:04.893 --> 00:15:06.555\nyou gotta make sure\nthat's already out there.\n\n275\n00:15:06.555 --> 00:15:07.545\n>> Exactly.\n\n276\n00:15:07.545 --> 00:15:11.225\nTo be honest, I haven't tried to see if\nI could do some sort of file share or\n\n277\n00:15:11.225 --> 00:15:12.145\nsomething to do that.\n\n278\n00:15:12.145 --> 00:15:16.405\nI assume if you can put the UNC path or\nwhatever in there it should work.\n\n279\n00:15:16.405 --> 00:15:18.280\nI have not tried that.\n\n280\n00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.260\nYou know, I haven't had any need\nto try it because NMap in and\n\n281\n00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:25.770\nof itself has a lot of\nthe power I need already.\n\n282\n00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.520\nSo I'm just not even gonna try it.\n\n283\n00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.060\nBut you feel free.\n\n284\n00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:33.090\nIf you do one, you know,\nhey let us know if you do worry,\n\n285\n00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:34.640\nI'd use it with the file share.\n\n286\n00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.400\nBut in any case, I've got this thing.\n\n287\n00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.845\nOnce you've typed in what you want,\njust go ahead and save it,\n\n288\n00:15:40.845 --> 00:15:42.995\nand you can go on and on and on with this.\n\n289\n00:15:42.995 --> 00:15:45.515\nJust remember, plain, simple text.\n\n290\n00:15:45.515 --> 00:15:47.453\nKeep it simple.\n\n291\n00:15:47.453 --> 00:15:50.158\nAnd so just use the .txt,\nthat's what it's looking for.\n\n292\n00:15:50.158 --> 00:15:51.737\nAny sort of funny business in there.\n\n293\n00:15:51.737 --> 00:15:54.094\n>> The rich text format, in other words,\nor anything crazy like that.\n\n294\n00:15:54.094 --> 00:15:55.382\n>> Yeah, yeah, don't get cute.\n\n295\n00:15:55.382 --> 00:15:57.909\n[LAUGH] We don't need emoticons or\n\n296\n00:15:57.909 --> 00:16:00.710\nanything like that in our\n>> File it.\n\n297\n00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.840\nYeah, you're welcome to try but\n\n298\n00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:07.030\ndon't expect anything to happen\nexcept Nmap to [NOISE] whatever.\n\n299\n00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:10.130\n>> So we got our script ready to roll,\nwhat's next?\n\n300\n00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:15.580\nOnce you've got that text file with\nthe commands that you wanna run\n\n301\n00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:20.460\nReady to go and remember, it doesn't exist\nby default, you have to create that.\n\n302\n00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:28.070\nIf you type in Dnmap_server and you put\nin a filename it ain't gonna do squat.\n\n303\n00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:32.100\nIt's just gonna,\nif there's no filename there and\n\n304\n00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.370\nyou put one in it's not gonna create it.\n\n305\n00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.340\n>> It'll just come back and\nsay I can't do anything.\n\n306\n00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.700\nI have no idea.\n\n307\n00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.600\nSo what you'll have to do is you'll\nhave to create that ahead of time.\n\n308\n00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.540\nSo preparation.\n\n309\n00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.600\nGet your commands ready and start\n>> put them in there.\n\n310\n00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.880\nYou know, the thing I really about\nthe fact that you've got that text file on\n\n311\n00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.630\nthere to be quite honest is, barring any\ncustom scripts or anything you've used,\n\n312\n00:16:55.630 --> 00:17:00.520\nwhat I really like about that is, is that\ntext file, if you're If you have like you\n\n313\n00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.810\nsaid, custom scans and all that,\nyou could put that on a flash drive and\n\n314\n00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:05.820\njust carry it with you\nfrom job to job to job.\n\n315\n00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:10.360\nPop it in, do some change to\nthe sub-nets in there which is easy or\n\n316\n00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.050\nIP addresses or if you're just\nscanning single IP addresses.\n\n317\n00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.386\nDrop them in there,\nsave it, and scan it again.\n\n318\n00:17:15.386 --> 00:17:17.850\nYou don't have to,\nto keep retyping in the whole scan,\n\n319\n00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:19.660\nyou just have to change\na small portion of it.\n\n320\n00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:23.210\nI mean,\ntremendous benefit just right there.\n\n321\n00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:27.890\nNow, once you have that done,\nwhat I've done for\n\n322\n00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:32.790\nus here is, you can see that I've got,\nat the bottom of my command window there,\n\n323\n00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:37.020\nI brought the command I'm gonna\nuse to fire up this dnmap server\n\n324\n00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:40.995\npay close attention to the syntax there.\n\n325\n00:17:40.995 --> 00:17:45.200\nDnmap_server, so\nwe've already been there, done that, so\n\n326\n00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.930\nwe know that's what the command is\nto start the server end of that up.\n\n327\n00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:55.260\nThe dash P, like we said up top, that is\ntelling it the port it's listening to.\n\n328\n00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.850\nI chose 1234 because\nit's easy to remember.\n\n329\n00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:59.238\nIt's the combination of my luggage.\n\n330\n00:17:59.238 --> 00:18:04.004\n[CROSSTALK] But then you've got\n\n331\n00:18:04.004 --> 00:18:08.586\nthe ports its listening to and\n\n332\n00:18:08.586 --> 00:18:15.010\nthe -f saying here's the endmap.txt.\n\n333\n00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:18.280\nOnce you've done that you just\ngo ahead and you hit enter.\n\n334\n00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.530\nNow, It's sitting there\nsaying it's listening.\n\n335\n00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:24.400\nIt's telling you it's just waiting for\nsomeone to connect.\n\n336\n00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.100\nThat's what you're seeing,\namount of online clients.\n\n337\n00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.850\nWell there's zero because I\nhaven't started up a client yet\n\n338\n00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:32.050\nso it's of course gonna be zero.\n\n339\n00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:33.640\nSo it's just gonna keep sitting there and\nsitting there and\n\n340\n00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.850\nsitting there and waiting.\n\n341\n00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.450\nOkay, so at this point.\n\n342\n00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:38.930\nThe DNmap server.\n\n343\n00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:39.790\nThat's done.\n\n344\n00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:40.810\nThat's set up.\n\n345\n00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:41.410\nIt's complete.\n\n346\n00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:46.910\nThere's nothing else really\nto do at this point in time.\n\n347\n00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:51.800\nNow, what I'm going to do is go over my\nKLEE 2A system and I will go ahead and\n\n348\n00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.690\nI'll start this up.\n\n349\n00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.180\nI'm gonna have to ask everyone not\nto look at the screen for a sec,\n\n350\n00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.506\nI'm gonna type my password in.\n\n351\n00:18:56.506 --> 00:18:59.650\n>> [LAUGH] So I'll go ahead and\n\n352\n00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:04.290\nthere's my DNmap client, so\nI just went up the menu and\n\n353\n00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:09.270\nchose DNmap client and so,\nnote the command, dnmap_client.\n\n354\n00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:13.720\nAgain, do not type in dnmap,\nit won't do anything.\n\n355\n00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.270\nAbsolutely do not type in nmap, nmap's\njust gonna cause you a lot of frustration\n\n356\n00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:21.850\nbecause while it's a great scanner It\ndoesn't know anything about DNmap,\n\n357\n00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:22.840\nit won't do anything.\n\n358\n00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.370\nIt'll just say well what do you want me to\ndo, what are you getting ticked off about,\n\n359\n00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:27.590\nyou want me to scan, I'll scan.\n\n360\n00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:31.664\nSo what I have here is\nlike a CDNmap client,\n\n361\n00:19:31.664 --> 00:19:35.390\nthe -s is telling it where\nthe server actually is.\n\n362\n00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:41.600\nThis is the IP address of the server, so\nI went ahead and noted that ahead of time.\n\n363\n00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.150\nAnd then a dash P tone at the port\non that server to connect to.\n\n364\n00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:51.670\nOnce I've done that, all I gotta do is hit\nEnter, and it's gonna start going through.\n\n365\n00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:55.150\nAnd you can see it's starting to\nactually download commands and run them.\n\n366\n00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:59.220\nThat's what I'm seeing here you know,\nso it' saying okay I've got this.\n\n367\n00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:04.690\nNow, I just put some scans in there\nthat aren't necessarily gonna be\n\n368\n00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:08.000\nvalid on this network because I don't want\nto kill anybody's machine on this network.\n\n369\n00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.105\nYou know Tim's bigger than me so\nI don't want to like tick him off.\n\n370\n00:20:11.105 --> 00:20:13.180\n>> [LAUGH] You know, so.\n\n371\n00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:17.510\nYeah, but it's gonna go through and\nit's doing its scan.\n\n372\n00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.090\nBut you kinda get the idea\nas far as that goes.\n\n373\n00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.860\nAny scan you can put into that\nNmap file or run in Nmap.\n\n374\n00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.010\nYou put in as long as it's\na valid scan in that context,\n\n375\n00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:30.585\nyou've got a valid subnet in,\nit will work the same way.\n\n376\n00:20:30.585 --> 00:20:31.890\nIt always has.\n\n377\n00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:36.795\nNow, if we go back to the Kali 2 system,\nso we know we have only\n\n378\n00:20:36.795 --> 00:20:41.660\n1 client at this point, I don't need to\nstart up multiple clients in this case,\n\n379\n00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.930\ncuz you've already seen how it works.\n\n380\n00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:47.250\nAll they have to do now is run\nthat exact same command I just did\n\n381\n00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.820\nRun it on as many clients as I want.\n\n382\n00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:54.160\nIf I have other KLEE systems out there, as\nlong as they can talk to this server, all\n\n383\n00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.630\nyou gotta do is run the exact same command\nI just did, tell it the IP address and\n\n384\n00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:02.590\nport, it'll pull down the n map file and\nstart having at so\n\n385\n00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:06.400\nnow I switched back because\nI'm done on that client side.\n\n386\n00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.300\nI fired the command.\n\n387\n00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.620\nNmap is there in the background running,\ndoing it scans and all that.\n\n388\n00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:17.030\nWhat I've seen here is you can see that on\nthis side of things, on the actual server,\n\n389\n00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:24.360\nso if I go back up through this you know,\nthere it is it was sitting there.\n\n390\n00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.710\nRemember you went through and\nhit enter and it was like,\n\n391\n00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:30.790\nclient's connected to zero, you keep\nseeing that again and again and again.\n\n392\n00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:34.530\nThen what happens is\napparently somewhere right in\n\n393\n00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:36.978\nhere we got attacked by Anonymous.\n\n394\n00:21:36.978 --> 00:21:41.490\n[LAUGH] But in any case,\nyou know we've got,\n\n395\n00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:48.740\nan IP address connected up to it, which\nis my other DNmap system the client side.\n\n396\n00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:52.770\nClient's connected, so you can see\nthe flag change from zero to one, and\n\n397\n00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:58.840\nnow after that you can see that that\nsystem is processing commands and\n\n398\n00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:01.700\nit fed the end map command out.\n\n399\n00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.040\nAnd it's kickin it back,\nsayin hey, I processed it.\n\n400\n00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:04.740\nBoom, here you go.\n\n401\n00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:09.160\nIt's just gonna keep goin right on\nthrough, and that's what you see.\n\n402\n00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:13.160\nIt's goin right on through that list,\nand boom.\n\n403\n00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.320\nAfter it got to that last bit of that\nthat last bit of scanning, like I said,\n\n404\n00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.450\nit went through this so quickly in\nthis case because not only did I not\n\n405\n00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:25.550\nwant to go through and throttle some\nsystem on this network here at ITPro,\n\n406\n00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:30.490\nI also didn't want it to be sitting here\nwatching a whole end map scan complete,\n\n407\n00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:32.010\nyou know multiple scans complete.\n\n408\n00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:32.730\nWe've seen that.\n\n409\n00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:33.360\nWe've done that.\n\n410\n00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.470\nWe don't need to see a whole scan go\nthrough and go, hey look, it did all that.\n\n411\n00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:41.250\nSo, what we've got here is,\nthe scan's actually completed.\n\n412\n00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:44.630\nIf I go over to my files again,\n\n413\n00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:49.395\nyou can see that it's actually\ngenerated some login information.\n\n414\n00:22:49.395 --> 00:22:51.395\nFormation and stuff like that in here.\n\n415\n00:22:51.395 --> 00:22:56.645\nAnd actually it only was able to\nfind this one valid range in here.\n\n416\n00:22:57.905 --> 00:23:02.605\nBut I could have actually gone through and\ntold it as part of this saying,\n\n417\n00:23:02.605 --> 00:23:06.675\nI didn't tell it to do it so\nit didn't generate a big log file.\n\n418\n00:23:06.675 --> 00:23:09.935\nBut I can tell it as it's\nfeeding those commands back,\n\n419\n00:23:09.935 --> 00:23:13.170\nyou'll notice that the DNmap server.\n\n420\n00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:19.240\nLet me start up another window here\njust so you can see this option.\n\n421\n00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:23.870\nIf I do dnmap server again,\n\n422\n00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:27.150\nyou can see that I can actually\ntell it to start logging stuff and\n\n423\n00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:32.240\ntell it the verbosity level,\ntell it how much I want it to\n\n424\n00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:37.450\nwant to actually grab and\nlog during that scanning process.\n\n425\n00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:41.198\nI just chose not to introduce that\noverhead but I can tell it to go ahead and\n\n426\n00:23:41.198 --> 00:23:41.699\ndo this.\n\n427\n00:23:41.699 --> 00:23:43.324\nNow let me point something else.\n\n428\n00:23:43.324 --> 00:23:46.923\nI didn't do this here, but just in case,\nwhen you're doing these scans.\n\n429\n00:23:46.923 --> 00:23:51.852\nYou're concerned about someone dropping\nin Wire Shark or having an IDS or\n\n430\n00:23:51.852 --> 00:23:57.560\nsomething running and that you're going\nto pick up that scan as it goes through.\n\n431\n00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:03.300\nNotice right down here there's\nanother interesting option right here,\n\n432\n00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.440\ngoing to run a TLS connection.\n\n433\n00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.700\nYeah, so if you've got the ability, this\nPEN file provides all the credentials and\n\n434\n00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.850\nencryption data used or\nrequired to set that up.\n\n435\n00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:16.730\nIf you want to, you could actually even\nencrypt, so when it sends the commands out\n\n436\n00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:21.160\nto the clients, or the clients pull them\ndown and it's sending information back.\n\n437\n00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.708\nI can encrypt all that so\nno one can sniff it or anything too.\n\n438\n00:24:23.708 --> 00:24:29.722\nSo, if you want to give it an extra\nlittle bump up in security during that,\n\n439\n00:24:29.722 --> 00:24:32.632\nto be maybe a little more stealthy or\n\n440\n00:24:32.632 --> 00:24:37.208\nmaybe to avoid detection,\nthat's indeed on the menu.\n\n441\n00:24:37.208 --> 00:24:41.154\nSomething else to kind of note here,\nI didn't require it here, but\n\n442\n00:24:41.154 --> 00:24:44.893\nif you do this on a live network and\nyou're doing your scanning,\n\n443\n00:24:44.893 --> 00:24:49.811\nstart finding out that you're letting the\nDN map server sit there, and your clients\n\n444\n00:24:49.811 --> 00:24:54.870\nare connecting and maybe you're getting\ndropped connections and the server saying,\n\n445\n00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:59.560\noh well I can't this guy just connected or\nwhatever, it's failed.\n\n446\n00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.880\nThere is the ability in there,\nthere's an option,\n\n447\n00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:06.960\nthis dash T option that I've highlighted,\nyou can actually adjust the time out,\n\n448\n00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:10.010\nso if you have a network congestion\nthat happens during this and\n\n449\n00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:13.880\ndo expect it to happen if you're\nrunning enough of these commands,\n\n450\n00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.470\nyou can set the time out so\nit's a little longer, so it doesn't so\n\n451\n00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:21.530\nthe connections when they are feeding\nstuff back and forth they don't start,\n\n452\n00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:26.305\nyou know severing the links and\nyou're like what's going on?\n\n453\n00:25:26.305 --> 00:25:28.195\nWell, you got a lot of network congestion.\n\n454\n00:25:28.195 --> 00:25:31.475\nIt's taking long to actually get\na complete confirmed connection.\n\n455\n00:25:31.475 --> 00:25:34.335\nWell, I'll just give you a little\nmore time to come back and\n\n456\n00:25:34.335 --> 00:25:35.795\nthen everyone's happy.\n\n457\n00:25:35.795 --> 00:25:41.445\nBut you can see overall, even though I\nonly had a server and a client here, you\n\n458\n00:25:41.445 --> 00:25:46.940\ncan see that just with those two systems\nI've already got the server set up.\n\n459\n00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:50.690\nI can set up as many clients really\nas I want at this point, and\n\n460\n00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:52.850\nyou can see the tremendous\namount of power,\n\n461\n00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:57.450\neven though I had four lines of commands,\nI could've kept going on and put 100, 200,\n\n462\n00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:01.410\n300 commands in there, and let it go and\njust walked away and let it do its thing.\n\n463\n00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:05.050\nAnd it kept scanning, and scanning,\nand scanning, and logging all that and\n\n464\n00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:06.750\ngoing right on through.\n\n465\n00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:11.450\nSo there are some really\ngreat things to do here, and\n\n466\n00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:15.260\njust the fact that you don't have to\ninvest much time to set it up at all.\n\n467\n00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:19.090\nProbably the thing that's going to cause\nyou the biggest amount of time here\n\n468\n00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:23.150\nis setting up that text file, and\nthat text file, if you plan it right,\n\n469\n00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.950\nyou only really got to do that once.\n\n470\n00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.130\nAfter you set it up,\nyou're just modifying it.\n\n471\n00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:31.060\n>> Yeah,\nthat seems like the big advantage, really.\n\n472\n00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:34.330\nIt's not like you're distributing\nthe text file out to the clients,\n\n473\n00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:38.250\nthey're just calling home and getting\nthe file and running those commands,\n\n474\n00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:43.160\nso you do that from one machine, you walk\nover to another area, you grab another\n\n475\n00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.690\nmachine, you run the client, you tell\nit to connect, it pulls down that file.\n\n476\n00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:50.170\nSo it's just saving you all\nthe time of running the individual\n\n477\n00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:52.550\nN map commands on each\nclient that you go to.\n\n478\n00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:53.420\nIt's just saying,\n\n479\n00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:57.290\nhey, go get this list, pull it down,\nrun those commands, basically.\n\n480\n00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:58.270\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n481\n00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:05.910\nIt's really, really simple as far as\nit goes, I mean as far as tools go.\n\n482\n00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.342\nN maps is doing the heavy lifting here.\n\n483\n00:27:08.342 --> 00:27:12.630\nDN map is just spoon feeding\nthe commands back and forth, and\n\n484\n00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:18.780\nthere's really not much there to\ndo as far as that is concerned.\n\n485\n00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:22.070\nYou're still really doing\nall the stuff in N map,\n\n486\n00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.740\ninstead of just typing\nup the command line,\n\n487\n00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:27.970\nnow you're typing into a text file and so\nyou're still in the Nmap frame of mind.\n\n488\n00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:32.190\nOnce you've got that, hey, listen on this\nport, use what's in this text file, and\n\n489\n00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:33.930\nthen start pointing stuff to it.\n\n490\n00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:39.010\nA word of caution though, when you're\nusing this is both systems I was using\n\n491\n00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:45.040\nhere on mine are both Kali 2.0 systems,\nthey're both the full installations.\n\n492\n00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:49.790\nOne of the things that was mentioned\nin a previous episode is that there is\n\n493\n00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:55.110\na full version of Kali, which I'm using,\nthere's also is a lite version of Kali.\n\n494\n00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:59.526\nThe full version's like\n3.1 gigs to download, and\n\n495\n00:27:59.526 --> 00:28:02.317\nthe lite version was 0.8 gigs.\n\n496\n00:28:02.317 --> 00:28:05.540\nSo, you're losing something there,\nsomebody's been put on a major diet there.\n\n497\n00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.220\nSo, what are you losing?\n\n498\n00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:12.350\nWell, the interface is different, like we\nsaid, it's a little easier on resources.\n\n499\n00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:16.870\nBut, there's also some tools that\nare stripped and one of them is dnmap.\n\n500\n00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:22.500\nYou can put dnmap over there because\nthere's nothing barring it from\n\n501\n00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:27.360\nbeing installed there, it just means that\nif you run one of these lite versions and\n\n502\n00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.200\nyou're like, where the heck did it go,\nthis should work, Kali 2 0.\n\n503\n00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.960\nI was watching ITPro and\nthey said it was here, I watched it.\n\n504\n00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.340\nYes, but\nit's not installed on the lite version.\n\n505\n00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.610\nIf you've got a full version, hey rock and\n\n506\n00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:42.320\nroll man no extra work needed other\nthan what we showed you here.\n\n507\n00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.508\nIf you're using the lite version,\n\n508\n00:28:43.508 --> 00:28:48.220\nyou've got to install that first, and\nthen do the stuff that we showed you.\n\n509\n00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:48.830\n>> Very good.\nAll right.\n\n510\n00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:52.160\nWell Sean, another great episode,\na lot of info there.\n\n511\n00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:57.630\nReally cool tool, DN map let's you\ndistribute those end map commands out or\n\n512\n00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:01.210\nreally call home and\nretrieve those end map commands so\n\n513\n00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:04.160\nthat we don't have to write those\ncommands on every single machined.\n\n514\n00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.350\nFantastic.\n\n515\n00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.810\nAnything else we want to toss\nin before we wrap this one up?\n\n516\n00:29:09.495 --> 00:29:12.985\nAll I can is I hope that was\nan interesting one to a lot of you,\n\n517\n00:29:12.985 --> 00:29:13.955\nto a lot of people.\n\n518\n00:29:13.955 --> 00:29:18.905\nI hope it's opening your eyes to something\nelse you can do that involves Nmap.\n\n519\n00:29:18.905 --> 00:29:23.395\nNmap's in so many things we've seen,\neither directly or\n\n520\n00:29:23.395 --> 00:29:26.505\nindirectly, this is just\nanother way of using that.\n\n521\n00:29:26.505 --> 00:29:31.470\nNmap reminds me kind of,\nin a way reminds me of like turkey a bit.\n\n522\n00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:34.370\nBecause you go to like Subway or\nsomething, there's turkey in that.\n\n523\n00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:35.070\nIt's not ham.\n\n524\n00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:35.690\nIt's turkey.\n\n525\n00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:38.350\nIt's like turkey of the IT world.\n\n526\n00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:42.270\nIt's just me.\n>> [LAUGH] I think Sean's ready for lunch.\n\n527\n00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:43.680\n>> Yeah.\n>> All right ladies and\n\n528\n00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.000\ngentlemen, we hope you\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n529\n00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.300\nSigning off for ITProTV I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n530\n00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.120\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n531\n00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.324\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n532\n00:29:50.324 -->

00:00:14.900\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.120\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.610\nAnd this episode, Sean, we're going to\nbe taking a look at password cracking.\n\n6\n00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.200\nI know we've got a lot of viewers out\nthere that might want to see how something\n\n7\n00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.840\nlike this is done and Sean's gonna\nwalk us through the process of\n\n8\n00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.570\ngetting things ready to crack passwords.\n\n9\n00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.500\nSo Sean, where do we start?\n\n10\n00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.240\n>> Well we've got a path\nto kind of go down and\n\n11\n00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.930\nto set up doing this whole\nprocess of password cracking.\n\n12\n00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.500\nIt's something that yeah we've talked\nabout in other shows before and\n\n13\n00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.770\nwe've said that's possible to do it.\n\n14\n00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.670\nSo now what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna talk about how it's done, and\n\n15\n00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.580\nshow you the process of getting\na ray to do the password crack,\n\n16\n00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.989\ngathering targets, building a word list.\n\n17\n00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.150\nAnd just getting to the point where\nall you gotta do is hit Enter and\n\n18\n00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.980\nlet the thing rock and roll at that point.\n\n19\n00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:07.870\n>> Thankfully for us,\n\n20\n00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.356\nSean is not gonna hit Enter so\nmy passwords are safe I think.\n\n21\n00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:15.249\n[LAUGH] I hope, I'm going to be watching\nhis finger over that Enter button.\n\n22\n00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:16.057\n>> It's like stop!\n\n23\n00:01:16.057 --> 00:01:18.774\n[SOUND] Don't touch it.\n\n24\n00:01:18.774 --> 00:01:21.970\n>> So I guess the first thing that we've\ngotta do is we've gotta pick our targets.\n\n25\n00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.385\nWe've gotta figure out who\nwe're gonna attack and\n\n26\n00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:27.855\nSean you had a great way to build\na list pretty quickly and easily right?\n\n27\n00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:31.920\n>> Yeah, you've got a list of options\nas far as how to build to targets okay?\n\n28\n00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.450\nSo, the choice is really yours.\n\n29\n00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.910\nBut one of the easiest ways is\nsomething that we've used time and\n\n30\n00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.120\ntime again which is to use Nmap.\n\n31\n00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.700\nNmap you can use it to do a quick\nsweep of a subnet or you can use it to\n\n32\n00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.800\nfeed in a file to it and say here's some\nsubnets I want you to take a look at.\n\n33\n00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.430\nSweep it.\n\n34\n00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.500\nDump it out to a file and then you can\nuse that file as your target list.\n\n35\n00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.210\nEasy way to that is you kind of want\nto do it quickly, easily, and get\n\n36\n00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.870\nthat information dumped is I've brought\nup a command line here on my screen.\n\n37\n00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.140\nWhich is just, I'm running Nmap,\nI'm running Nmap and\n\n38\n00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.360\nnote the switch in there, it's -s,\n\n39\n00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.780\nand then P, and\nthen I put in an IP subnet.\n\n40\n00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.440\nAnd then put in my little\ngreater than symbol,\n\n41\n00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.210\nand told it pipe it out to a text file.\n\n42\n00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.290\nAnd all that's gonna do at that point,\nonce I go ahead and say, okay, that's my\n\n43\n00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.920\ncommand I wanna run, hit Enter, it's gonna\ngo ahead and do what Nmap always does, and\n\n44\n00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.660\nit does really well,\nis to sweep that range of IP addresses.\n\n45\n00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.140\nIf you use something like a dat file,\n\n46\n00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.890\nwhich is in this case, for nmap,\nis just a simple text file,\n\n47\n00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.370\nyou can actually create a dat file\nthat has a list of subnets in it.\n\n48\n00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.560\nAnd then just feed that right into\nNmap and it'll do the same thing.\n\n49\n00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.190\nAnd what it'll do is it will\ngenerate just a simple text file\n\n50\n00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.270\nlike we're doing here that has\na list of hosts inside of it.\n\n51\n00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.510\nAnd you've seen that list before\nget output to the screen.\n\n52\n00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.570\nIt's doing the same thing here.\n\n53\n00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.020\nIt's gonna take some time,\nsweep that range of hosts, and\n\n54\n00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.520\nthen we'll have that host.txt.\n\n55\n00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.430\nI'm scanning just in my\nlocal VMware subnet in here,\n\n56\n00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.410\nso it's nothing really\nall that exciting and\n\n57\n00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.510\nI think you get the idea what an IP Subnet\nand range of IP addresses look like.\n\n58\n00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.380\nBut what I want you to note off\nof this one is we're taking that,\n\n59\n00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.010\nwe're using Nmap to generate that\ntarget list because it's much\n\n60\n00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.910\neasier to do it this way than it would\nbe to just pipe them in individually.\n\n61\n00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.590\nNow if you had an individual target you\nwanted to do a password crack against,\n\n62\n00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.960\nthen you don't need to do this.\n\n63\n00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.150\nYou can take the NMap step,\npush it aside and say, well,\n\n64\n00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.580\nI'm not targeting the whole range of them,\nhere I am deciding that I do want to\n\n65\n00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.490\ntarget a whole range of hosts for my\npassword attack so I'm building that list.\n\n66\n00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.680\nKeep in mind though, do plan your stuff\nout carefully here, very carefully\n\n67\n00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.810\nbecause the implication here is when I do\nNmap and I'm building this list of hosts,\n\n68\n00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.930\nlet's say that suddenly it had 30,\n40, 50 hosts on it.\n\n69\n00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.840\nYou're gonna run a password crack\nagainst all of them doing it?\n\n70\n00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.120\nYeah, you better really think that\nstrategy through there because that's\n\n71\n00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.020\ngonna generate a lot of noise and\nyou could get caught relatively easily,\n\n72\n00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.170\nespecially if there is an IDS or\nsomething running.\n\n73\n00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.350\nSo really think about if this\nis the best strategy to do that.\n\n74\n00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.870\nYou might run NMAP just to\nsee which hosts are there and\n\n75\n00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.610\nthen maybe do a little extra stuff with\nit to see what services are running and\n\n76\n00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.380\nthen use that for one of your later\nphases we are going to talk about.\n\n77\n00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.960\nBut think about if it's just,\nyou wanna go just right across and\n\n78\n00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.230\nsay hey these hosts are up.\n\n79\n00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.520\nI'm sweeping all these, I'm gonna sweep\nall these hosts and target all of them.\n\n80\n00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.940\nProbably not the best and\nsmartest idea to do, but you could do it.\n\n81\n00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.470\n>> Not to mention extremely\ntime consuming, I would assume.\n\n82\n00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.120\n>> Yeah, it could be very, very time\nconsuming to do that, especially if you're\n\n83\n00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.610\nrunning a brute force attack or something,\nthat would be a very good point.\n\n84\n00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.130\nA brute force attack against\none system can take a while.\n\n85\n00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.460\nAgainst multiple systems, I mean, you're\nreally jacking that time up, you know,\n\n86\n00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.630\npretty high, so really think about this,\nyour strategy here, and plan it out.\n\n87\n00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.240\nIt sounds kinda cool and sexy from\na certain way to just, oh, well heck.\n\n88\n00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.490\nSweep a whole range of them and\npassword crack them all.\n\n89\n00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.420\nYou know, to hell with getting caught.\n\n90\n00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.590\nIt's not the goal here.\n\n91\n00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.010\nSo we wanna be very,\nvery careful about how we do things.\n\n92\n00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.490\nWhen I put out that text file.\n\n93\n00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.000\nI'm gonna get a text\nfile right out of NMAP.\n\n94\n00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.840\nI've got this thing\nhighlighted right here.\n\n95\n00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.900\nI'll just get a simple text file and\nyou can see that\n\n96\n00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.439\nit actually finished obviously right when\nas soon as I looked away [LAUGH] and\n\n97\n00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:12.887\nnot looking as it finishes.\n\n98\n00:06:12.887 --> 00:06:16.879\n[LAUGH] I've got that text file here\nwith a list of IP addresses in it.\n\n99\n00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:21.863\nYou know, so,\nonce I've got that what I will\n\n100\n00:06:21.863 --> 00:06:26.977\ndo is take NMap out of\nthe picture the next thing\n\n101\n00:06:26.977 --> 00:06:31.890\nto do is to move on to\ncreating a word list.\n\n102\n00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:32.440\nOkay?\n\n103\n00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.790\nNow this is your option.\n\n104\n00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.800\nI'm going to use a brute\nforce attack here, but\n\n105\n00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.050\nyou don't have to use\na brute force attack.\n\n106\n00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.980\nYou can use other things as well, but\n\n107\n00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.450\nwe're just going to focus\non the brute force one.\n\n108\n00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:51.350\nAnd so the way I would do, set up my\nword list so I've got the host list.\n\n109\n00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.580\nSo I've got step where\nI've got my target list.\n\n110\n00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.610\nNext thing I've got is,\nI want to do my actual word list.\n\n111\n00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:59.840\nAnd the way to do that for\n\n112\n00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:06.240\nbrute forcing is I can do this actual\nprogram on here called Crunch.\n\n113\n00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.590\nCrunch is actually\na really easy tool to use.\n\n114\n00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.200\nWhat you can do is do crunch.\n\n115\n00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.900\nAnd what you're going to do is that\nis going to tell you, you know,\n\n116\n00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.860\nwhat the range in\npasswords are going to be.\n\n117\n00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:24.280\nDon't get cute with this, and\nthe reason why I'm saying and\n\n118\n00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.630\nmean by that is, when you go through and\ntype into this minute max, don't say oh,\n\n119\n00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:33.250\nwell I want to have everything\nbetween eight and sixteen characters.\n\n120\n00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.650\nYou type that in and\nhit Enter, guess what?\n\n121\n00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.100\nIt's going to take awhile.\n\n122\n00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:42.290\nYou better go and raise your kids\nfrom the age of three to five,\n\n123\n00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:45.170\nand come back, and we'll be done.\n\n124\n00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.065\n>> Something we would probably want to\ndo ahead of time if we do need to use\n\n125\n00:07:49.065 --> 00:07:50.623\npassword links that long.\n\n126\n00:07:50.623 --> 00:07:54.329\nAlso I would think this is where our\nreconnaissance phase information,\n\n127\n00:07:54.329 --> 00:07:57.620\nif we go back to the hacking lifecycle or\nthe pen test lifecycle.\n\n128\n00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:02.200\nMaybe having an idea of what their\npassword policy is, so that I know what\n\n129\n00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.870\ntheir length is, whether complexity\nis enabled, and things like that.\n\n130\n00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.220\nThat might help in this phase.\n\n131\n00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.680\n>> Yeah, Mike's got an interesting point,\ngot a very interesting,\n\n132\n00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.270\nexcellent point there,\nis that one of the prior phases two paths\n\n133\n00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.840\nare cracking if you're following the\ntemplate or blueprint for ethical hacking.\n\n134\n00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.595\nOne of those is to do a scanning.\n\n135\n00:08:23.595 --> 00:08:28.862\nPart of its enumeration, you're trying\nto extract what services are running and\n\n136\n00:08:28.862 --> 00:08:31.393\non top of that, enumerations is okay.\n\n137\n00:08:31.393 --> 00:08:36.869\nLet's pull banners out of it and we could\nsee maybe, for some of those banners,\n\n138\n00:08:36.869 --> 00:08:41.283\nthey might be able to tell us what\nthe password policy there is and\n\n139\n00:08:41.283 --> 00:08:44.010\nthat may not be too difficult to grasp.\n\n140\n00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:47.240\nBut if somebody is doing\nwhat we saw in our\n\n141\n00:08:48.815 --> 00:08:54.095\na little bit of in the episode\nwe did on Responder.\n\n142\n00:08:54.095 --> 00:08:56.945\nNet BIOS is running in a lot of places.\n\n143\n00:08:56.945 --> 00:09:01.615\nNet bias may be your\npoint of entry to go in,\n\n144\n00:09:01.615 --> 00:09:06.220\nand pull those policy settings off of it,\nand say I can narrow it down a bit more.\n\n145\n00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.537\nYou can also use some common sense in\nhere if you really think about it.\n\n146\n00:09:09.537 --> 00:09:12.900\nDo you wanna do a two character\npassword in practice?\n\n147\n00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.280\nProbably not.\n\n148\n00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.295\nAnyone's doing a two character\npassword they deserve to get hacked.\n\n149\n00:09:17.295 --> 00:09:20.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We have that disclaimer ready, right?\n\n150\n00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.950\n>> I think so.\n\n151\n00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.710\n>> [LAUGH] So to keep it simple,\nthe min and max,\n\n152\n00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.790\ntwo characters to four characters.\n\n153\n00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.990\nAnd then what you would do with this one\nis you would just pipe that out to a file.\n\n154\n00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.890\nAnd you can name the file\nwhatever you want.\n\n155\n00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:38.190\nIf you're gonna call it passwords.txt,\nhey, more power to you.\n\n156\n00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.140\nCall it whatever you want.\n\n157\n00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.350\nJust remember what\nthe name of that file is.\n\n158\n00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.960\nSo, I'm just gonna go ahead and\nit tells me hey,\n\n159\n00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.990\nit's gonna generate something\nthat's two megabytes in size.\n\n160\n00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:50.720\nThat didn't take long at all,\nbut then again,\n\n161\n00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.120\nthose passwords aren't that complex.\n\n162\n00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.955\nJust in case you're curious.\n\n163\n00:09:54.955 --> 00:09:59.130\n>> 475,000 lines it looks like it did.\n\n164\n00:09:59.130 --> 00:09:59.630\n>> Yeah.\n>> Nice.\n\n165\n00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.200\n>> Yeah not that many it did that\n\n166\n00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.250\npretty quickly.\n\n167\n00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.800\nJust in case you wanna get an idea\nof what I was talking about,\n\n168\n00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.280\nif you did 8 to 16 characters.\n\n169\n00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:15.120\nI'll cancel this, but if you look at\nit look at the size of that, petabytes.\n\n170\n00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.950\n>> Yeah.\n>> How often do you see that.\n\n171\n00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.380\nThat's why I'm saying do\nnot get cute with this and\n\n172\n00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.330\njust say, oh,\nI'm going to create this this way.\n\n173\n00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:31.320\nYou'll be waiting a heck of a while\nI mean terabytes and petabytes.\n\n174\n00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.229\nFirst of all you're gonna have to go\nthrough and buy a lot more hard drives.\n\n175\n00:10:34.229 --> 00:10:37.633\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or you need to revisit our course\n\n176\n00:10:37.633 --> 00:10:41.069\nfrom last week, the cloud,\nbecause that's what you're gonna need.\n\n177\n00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:47.092\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So once you've got that list built,\n\n178\n00:10:47.092 --> 00:10:55.150\njust to kind of show you what got\nbuilt off of that, here's my pass.txt.\n\n179\n00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.610\nThat's from a previous one that I set up.\n\n180\n00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:02.910\nThis is the passwords.txt that I just ran.\n\n181\n00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:08.430\nIt should just open right up,\nthere you go.\n\n182\n00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.720\nIt's actually a pretty decently sized,\nit's still loading it.\n\n183\n00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.340\nIt's a text file, it's still loading it.\n\n184\n00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.664\n>> I was gonna say that's 475,000 lines.\n\n185\n00:11:14.664 --> 00:11:16.885\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can see the little bar,\n\n186\n00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:21.511\nyour icon bar went away for\na second and Kali's going [SOUND].\n\n187\n00:11:21.511 --> 00:11:26.300\n>> Remember this was actually than 475,000\nlines, because remember I had that second\n\n188\n00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.040\ncommand and I said that, it actually\nover wrote that one with this one.\n\n189\n00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.080\nThat's why it's still loading.\n\n190\n00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.640\nLook at the size of the file!\n\n191\n00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.620\nI can't even cancel it right now!\n\n192\n00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.100\nBut it's a pretty decent size file.\n\n193\n00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.920\nI think this one, and\nI canceled it pretty quick.\n\n194\n00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.379\nI think it was actually\ncoming down to 136MB or\n\n195\n00:11:45.379 --> 00:11:48.982\nsomething like that, yeah 136MB.\n\n196\n00:11:48.982 --> 00:11:51.158\nI only read it for like a second.\n\n197\n00:11:51.158 --> 00:11:58.760\nSo, this pass.txt it's,\nthis one has a bigger or\n\n198\n00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:04.610\nlonger list of passwords\ninto what I created earlier.\n\n199\n00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:09.910\nBut still,\nit's not a small file by any means.\n\n200\n00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.960\nIt's a pretty decent sized file.\n\n201\n00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.500\nSo, in any case,\nwe've got that part of it done,\n\n202\n00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.100\nso we've got a word list being built.\n\n203\n00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.600\nKeep in mind, you don't have to build\na word list if you don't want to.\n\n204\n00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.910\nThere's plenty of\ndictionary files out there.\n\n205\n00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.100\nSo if you want to go out there and\ngrab a dictionary file and\n\n206\n00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.110\nnot do this, you definitely can do that.\n\n207\n00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:35.510\nIf you want to generate one on your own\nof passwords you think are most likely,\n\n208\n00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:40.920\nthen you can easily just type those\neggs into your own text file.\n\n209\n00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.120\nType them in and go ahead.\n\n210\n00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.960\nOkay, so you got options there.\n\n211\n00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.210\nSo once you got that done,\nthen you got, so\n\n212\n00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:56.420\nwe got our hosts file,\nwe got a list of hosts, we got a list\n\n213\n00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.490\nof actual passwords for\nour brute force attack.\n\n214\n00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:05.010\nSo we'll just go ahead and\nwe've got those things done, so\n\n215\n00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:07.770\nwe're just gonna keep\nmoving the process along.\n\n216\n00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:12.820\nWhat I want to do here before I\nactually show the password cracker,\n\n217\n00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:17.200\nis I want to talk for\na few moments about Medusa,\n\n218\n00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.000\nwhich is the password cracker\nthat I'm going to use.\n\n219\n00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.850\nIt's a command line password cracker,\n\n220\n00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:30.180\nit does the stuff that the big boys do,\na lot of the stuff that the big boys do.\n\n221\n00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:34.280\nWhat's really neat about it is it\ndoes a whole range of attacks and\n\n222\n00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.530\nyou can actually tell it what\nmodules you want to run.\n\n223\n00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:41.610\nThose modules are kind of like the same\ntype of concept we use in Metasploit and\n\n224\n00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:46.740\nstuff like that, where it loads in\nmodules that take advantage specific\n\n225\n00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.690\nvulnerabilities on the system,\nthe exploits get loaded inside of that.\n\n226\n00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.240\nThat's what this will do.\n\n227\n00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:59.180\nSo, what I'm gonna do is I will\njust kind of give you a peek at it.\n\n228\n00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:04.050\nYou can access the Medusa\npassword cracker right through\n\n229\n00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.200\nthe application menu inside of Kali Linux.\n\n230\n00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:13.140\nAnd by the way, I want to show\nthe password cracking process here.\n\n231\n00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.040\nIf it just did one form\nfrom beginning to end.\n\n232\n00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.257\nMedusa is not something\nthat's new to Kali and\n\n233\n00:14:19.257 --> 00:14:22.640\nLinux 2.0, it's something that\nhas been around for a while.\n\n234\n00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.150\nBut I kinda wanted to show you.\n\n235\n00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.030\nWe're talking about moving\nfrom end to end, and how to\n\n236\n00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:31.920\ngo through the password cracking process\nto show you what that looks like, and\n\n237\n00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.770\njust put everything together with several\nthings that we've been talking about.\n\n238\n00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:39.480\nKeep in mind some of the stuff\nwe talked about in our episodes\n\n239\n00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.890\nthat we've done so far.\n\n240\n00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.450\nWe talked about DN Map.\n\n241\n00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.200\nGuess what?\n\n242\n00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.660\nThat can build a pretty good\nlist of targets for you too.\n\n243\n00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.470\nSo you could work that in there.\n\n244\n00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.970\nAnd we've got other things that\nyou could work into here too.\n\n245\n00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:58.240\nSo, really think about what options you\nmight have going for you at this point.\n\n246\n00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:02.370\nSo, to run Medusa,\nif you're at the terminal already,\n\n247\n00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:04.440\nyou could just type in Medusa.\n\n248\n00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:08.530\nAnd when we talk about the capabilities\nof this password cracker,\n\n249\n00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:13.770\nwe'll talk about it, and look at\nthe options that are available in this.\n\n250\n00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:16.150\nAnd so\nyou can kinda see the power of it, and\n\n251\n00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:21.960\nthen what I'm gonna do is I will\nshow you how it's actually used.\n\n252\n00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.840\nSo these are the options on it.\n\n253\n00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.575\nIf you take a look,\nI'm gonna shortcut things here.\n\n254\n00:15:28.575 --> 00:15:33.005\nHere, I know I generated that host's file,\nbut to keep things simple for\n\n255\n00:15:33.005 --> 00:15:37.006\nwhat we're doing, I'm just going\nto use a single IP address, but\n\n256\n00:15:37.006 --> 00:15:41.794\nwith that in mind if you did want to use\nthat host file that I generated with nMap,\n\n257\n00:15:41.794 --> 00:15:44.956\nvery, very easy to do,\nyou just type in the medusa.\n\n258\n00:15:44.956 --> 00:15:47.868\nAnd then what you do is\nyou just do this -H, and\n\n259\n00:15:47.868 --> 00:15:52.501\nthen you just pop in the name of your\nhost file, so that host.txt I created\n\n260\n00:15:52.501 --> 00:15:56.649\nwith nmap you just would pop that\nin there and you're ready to go.\n\n261\n00:15:56.649 --> 00:15:57.427\nOkay?\n\n262\n00:15:57.427 --> 00:16:02.081\nThe other things you have if you have\nMultiple user names you want to check.\n\n263\n00:16:02.081 --> 00:16:03.637\n'Kay, think about it.\n\n264\n00:16:03.637 --> 00:16:08.495\nIf you went through and did an Nmap scan\nin your earlier ethical hacking phase and\n\n265\n00:16:08.495 --> 00:16:11.542\nyou went through and\nfingerprinted those hosts,\n\n266\n00:16:11.542 --> 00:16:14.620\nyou know what operating systems are there.\n\n267\n00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:18.110\nAnd you could assume that on\na lot of operating systems what\n\n268\n00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.430\nuser accounts are there.\n\n269\n00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:22.280\nIf you've got Windows host,\nyou know there's administrator and\n\n270\n00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.740\nthere's guest on every last one of those.\n\n271\n00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.685\nSo if you want to test those,\nespecially the administrator account,\n\n272\n00:16:28.685 --> 00:16:33.615\nyou could just type in the name\nof the administrator account.\n\n273\n00:16:33.615 --> 00:16:35.661\nYou could very easily say that dash,\n\n274\n00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:40.625\nlittle case u and put in the name of\nthe administrator account specifically.\n\n275\n00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:46.620\nBut if you know corporate policy or\nyou know the names of other user accounts,\n\n276\n00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:50.760\nyou could just use the capital U option\nand put all those usernames on a separate\n\n277\n00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.570\nline inside their own text file and\nhave it test each one of those.\n\n278\n00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.870\nSo that gives you another\nlevel of flexibility.\n\n279\n00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:01.050\nYou can really see that\nif you get creative and\n\n280\n00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.970\nreally think things through and plan it,\nYou can test a lot of stuff and\n\n281\n00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:10.730\nbreak a lot of stuff this way if you\nwant but again don't get crazy with it.\n\n282\n00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:14.030\nDon't do like people do in Vegas like hey\nthere's a buffet let's have everything.\n\n283\n00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.495\nNo, don't do that.\n\n284\n00:17:16.495 --> 00:17:20.429\nDo be very very careful\nwhat you're using and\n\n285\n00:17:20.429 --> 00:17:25.614\nreally kind of measure what\nyour attack is gonna look like.\n\n286\n00:17:25.614 --> 00:17:31.373\n'Kay, so as I go through this, you can\nsee we have plenty of other options.\n\n287\n00:17:31.373 --> 00:17:35.986\nBut some of the ones I kinda want\nto talk about is that we do have\n\n288\n00:17:35.986 --> 00:17:39.152\ndifferent modules, and those modules,\n\n289\n00:17:39.152 --> 00:17:43.690\nthey can go against really\na number of different services.\n\n290\n00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:45.884\nAnd I'm gonna give you\na list of modules so\n\n291\n00:17:45.884 --> 00:17:49.960\nyou can see the breadth of what this\nhas the ability to work against.\n\n292\n00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:55.360\nAnd then you also have\nthe ability right kind of\n\n293\n00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:00.330\ndown here, all these blocks,\nthat allows you to customize your scan.\n\n294\n00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.180\nSo remember what we're saying,\nthat you probably wouldn't wanna go and\n\n295\n00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.620\nsweep a whole range of stuff with\npassword cracking techniques.\n\n296\n00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:11.150\nBut if you did have like four or\nfive you want test maybe, and\n\n297\n00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:14.180\nyou still wanna maintain\na degree of stealthiness.\n\n298\n00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:19.380\nWell what you can do is you can actually\ntake these options and tell the system\n\n299\n00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:24.530\ndivide up the threads this way,\nslow down the scans a bit, do\n\n300\n00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:29.710\nwhatever to tweak it a bit more to be more\nevasive so your IDSs won't pick it up.\n\n301\n00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:33.970\nIt's better to stay on the, more on the\nconservative side than really jack this\n\n302\n00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:35.700\nthing up because you're impatient.\n\n303\n00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.218\nTake your time as we've always said,\npatience is a virtue.\n\n304\n00:18:39.218 --> 00:18:43.230\nPatience, grasshopper.\n\n305\n00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:48.550\nSo let's just take a quick look at\none of these things right here,\n\n306\n00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.460\nthis dash lowercase d,\n\n307\n00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:57.025\nthat's one that I just wanna direct your\nattention to for just a second, okay.\n\n308\n00:18:57.025 --> 00:19:02.425\nI did that lowercase d in here.\n\n309\n00:19:02.425 --> 00:19:06.155\nTake a look at what it's revealing to us.\n\n310\n00:19:07.785 --> 00:19:11.880\nThat list you've got up on screen,\nthose are all the modules, right there,\n\n311\n00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.980\nthat come with Medusa.\n\n312\n00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:13.810\nEach and\n\n313\n00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:18.600\nevery one of those is a service that you\ncan target specifically with Medusa.\n\n314\n00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.246\nSo you're just not gonna say hey,\ngo out there and\n\n315\n00:19:21.246 --> 00:19:23.517\njust beat on every little thing out there.\n\n316\n00:19:23.517 --> 00:19:26.919\nYou have to tell it specifically\nwhat it's looking for.\n\n317\n00:19:26.919 --> 00:19:29.500\nOkay, so you would go in here and tell it.\n\n318\n00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.600\nWell what do you want to break?\n\n319\n00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.760\nI mean, look at the options.\n\n320\n00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.172\nYou've got Telnet, VNC, Web forms.\n\n321\n00:19:35.172 --> 00:19:40.027\nYou've got SQL stuff in there,\nMySQL, specifically FTP.\n\n322\n00:19:40.027 --> 00:19:41.540\nYou know, you can do that.\n\n323\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.990\nIf someone decides to get cute and run one\nof those services as appropriate on a port\n\n324\n00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:48.840\nthat's non-standard,\nthere's a switch in there.\n\n325\n00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.250\nYou can use a dash P and\ntell it hey, FTP's not on port 21.\n\n326\n00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.380\nIt's on port 70 because this\nperson decided to put it there.\n\n327\n00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.860\nWhatever, you scanned it.\n\n328\n00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:57.639\nYou pulled a banner.\n\n329\n00:19:57.639 --> 00:20:00.958\nYou found out it is port 70 minus p.\n\n330\n00:20:00.958 --> 00:20:01.737\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n331\n00:20:01.737 --> 00:20:06.820\n>> Pop it over onto port 70 and\nnow redirect your target over that.\n\n332\n00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.130\nNothing's any different\nexcept the port number.\n\n333\n00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:12.890\n>> Nice.\n>> So you've just adapted and overcome,\n\n334\n00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:14.470\nas they say.\n\n335\n00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:18.760\nSo you just have to tell it\nwhat module you want it to run.\n\n336\n00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:23.764\nThe way you tell it which module,\nlet me close that and look\n\n337\n00:20:23.764 --> 00:20:30.321\nat a couple of examples of our last couple\nsteps here is I have Medusa up here.\n\n338\n00:20:30.321 --> 00:20:32.028\nYou can see -h.\n\n339\n00:20:32.028 --> 00:20:35.975\nIt's a lowercase h so\nit's given an IP address.\n\n340\n00:20:35.975 --> 00:20:37.785\nIf I did the uppercase H,\n\n341\n00:20:37.785 --> 00:20:41.979\ninstead I would've replaced an IP\naddress with that host.txt.\n\n342\n00:20:41.979 --> 00:20:42.857\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n343\n00:20:42.857 --> 00:20:46.357\n>> To keep it nice and understandable\nright here, I just stuck that in there but\n\n344\n00:20:46.357 --> 00:20:50.407\nyou could easily do that host.txt,\nno problem, okay?\n\n345\n00:20:50.407 --> 00:20:54.450\nThe dash u or lower case u,\ngive it the name of an account, so\n\n346\n00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:59.230\nit's going on that machine,\nit's going after the admin account, okay.\n\n347\n00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:02.710\nAnd if I did uppercase U then I\nwould have something in there a text\n\n348\n00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:07.700\nfile that had a list of user names in\nthere, so you can see dash P uppercase P,\n\n349\n00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.080\nwhat does it have, well.\n\n350\n00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.930\nIt's going to go after this.\n\n351\n00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.450\nThose are the passwords.\n\n352\n00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:14.400\nThat's the text file that\ngenerated the passwords.\n\n353\n00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.250\nAnd then that uppercase M,\nit's going to use the FTP module.\n\n354\n00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:23.510\nSo it's going to go to that system and\ntarget the FTP service.\n\n355\n00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:27.629\nAnd if you want to change it a bit,\nthere's doing the same thing, but\n\n356\n00:21:27.629 --> 00:21:32.387\nI changed the module switch at the end,\nwell, the IP address is different, but\n\n357\n00:21:32.387 --> 00:21:35.317\nI changed the module switch\nat the end with SNMP.\n\n358\n00:21:35.317 --> 00:21:40.319\nSo now it's doing the exact same type\nof thing, but it's switched its focus\n\n359\n00:21:40.319 --> 00:21:45.185\nover to the SNMP service and it's going\nto try to beat on that to open it up.\n\n360\n00:21:45.185 --> 00:21:45.860\n>> Nice.\n\n361\n00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:51.140\n>> So, all you literally have to do\nat this point is just hit Enter.\n\n362\n00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:55.293\nI was waiting for Mike to come over\nhere and, don't you do it, you know?\n\n363\n00:21:55.293 --> 00:21:56.941\n>> [LAUGH] Uncle, uncle, I call uncle.\n\n364\n00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:58.600\n>> So I tap out.\n\n365\n00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:04.250\nSo that's all you literally have to\ndo at this point is this right here.\n\n366\n00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:10.470\nAs long as there's a live machine back\nthere, which we'll assume that there is.\n\n367\n00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:13.940\nThere's a live machine because we did,\nwe'll say that we went through our Nmap\n\n368\n00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.110\nfile and\nfound that that IP address was live.\n\n369\n00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:17.880\nSo we just picked one off the list and\n\n370\n00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.420\ndropped it in there,\nall you gotta do now is hit Enter.\n\n371\n00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:27.130\nAnd hey, wait for the fireworks and\nsee if you actually get in.\n\n372\n00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:28.140\n>> That's fantastic, Sean.\n\n373\n00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:32.480\nI mean, a really good look at\nthe process and the thought process\n\n374\n00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.410\nas well as the actually physical\nprocess that we need to go through\n\n375\n00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:39.701\nif we're going to try to do some password\ntracking, hopefully as a pen tester.\n\n376\n00:22:39.701 --> 00:22:42.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or as an ethical hacker.\n\n377\n00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.192\nBut easy enough I mean,\nthese are tools that we've seen.\n\n378\n00:22:45.192 --> 00:22:48.110\nWe've gone over,\nwe've probably used before.\n\n379\n00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:51.980\nAll we did was take Nmap and you can use\nany other tool that could do a port scan\n\n380\n00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.210\nand generate a list of live hosts.\n\n381\n00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.430\nAnd we pumped that out to a text file.\n\n382\n00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.770\nThen he used, what did you use, Crunch or?\n\n383\n00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:00.450\n>> I used Crunch.\n\n384\n00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:02.930\n>> Crunch to generate that word list.\n\n385\n00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.900\nAnd there's other programs you could\nuse but Crunch is right there.\n\n386\n00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.951\nIt was right in Kali 2.0, right?\n\n387\n00:23:07.951 --> 00:23:11.010\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Tell it how many characters you want in\n\n388\n00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:11.540\nyour password.\n\n389\n00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.460\nIf you've done your research and\nyou've found their password policy\n\n390\n00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.940\nthen you know about how many characters or\nat least a minimum number of characters\n\n391\n00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.450\nthat should be in there so\nyou can generate that word list.\n\n392\n00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.260\nAnd then you just plug it all together\nat the end with a tool like Medusa,\n\n393\n00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:28.530\nwhere you just tell it okay, here's\nthe list of live hosts that I wanna do.\n\n394\n00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:30.970\nOr you could limit it\nto a single IP address.\n\n395\n00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.910\nHere's the user name I wanna try to find,\nor\n\n396\n00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:36.000\nhere's a list of user names that\nI wanna feed into this tool.\n\n397\n00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.740\nHere's a list of passwords\nthat I want you to try to use.\n\n398\n00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:44.868\nIt really is just down to do I\nhave enough time to wait and\n\n399\n00:23:44.868 --> 00:23:47.833\nsee if I can crack some\nof those passwords?\n\n400\n00:23:47.833 --> 00:23:50.372\n[LAUGH]\n>> Don't make me do it.\n\n401\n00:23:50.372 --> 00:23:52.600\n>> So, I mean, really cool stuff there.\n\n402\n00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.510\nYou get to see the process from beginning\nto end, and the only thing we didn't see\n\n403\n00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:59.730\nwas maybe the actual waiting around for\nthe password to add it.\n\n404\n00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:00.960\nMy passwords are so\n\n405\n00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:06.280\nlong that we don't have enough time or\ntape to record that process.\n\n406\n00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.740\nSo Sean's not gonna do\nthat part right there.\n\n407\n00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.990\nSo great information, Sean.\n\n408\n00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:14.540\nAny parting thoughts for\nus on password cracking?\n\n409\n00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:19.250\n>> What I wanna add on kinda\nto the tail end of this is\n\n410\n00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:23.750\njust to draw your attention back\nto something that was talked about\n\n411\n00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:28.180\nduring ethical hacking process\nwhen we went through that for\n\n412\n00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:32.120\nthe CEH and\nkind of flushed things out there.\n\n413\n00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.890\nWas the fact that when we looked at this,\nlooked at all the tools,\n\n414\n00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:42.070\nI said remember, these tools and\nthese steps, they aren't isolated steps.\n\n415\n00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:46.280\nWhat we did here is we actually\nnot only used multiple tools, but\n\n416\n00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.490\nwe went across multiple steps.\n\n417\n00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:52.720\nWe even talked about some things\nthat weren't directly shown here.\n\n418\n00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.440\nFor example,\n\n419\n00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.770\nyou were talking about how to find out\nthe lengths of password and policy.\n\n420\n00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:00.769\nWe could do that through enumeration and\nscanning.\n\n421\n00:25:00.769 --> 00:25:04.230\nWe took our scanning through Nmap.\n\n422\n00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:09.821\nWe did our password cracking with Medusa,\nwe went through and\n\n423\n00:25:09.821 --> 00:25:13.909\nwe used an enumeration\nprocess to scanning,\n\n424\n00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:18.440\nto pull out and\nsee which modules we wanna target.\n\n425\n00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.062\nAnd we just mixed in some\ncommon sense about or\n\n426\n00:25:21.062 --> 00:25:25.756\nwe would mix in some common sense about\nlengths of passwords and stuff like that,\n\n427\n00:25:25.756 --> 00:25:28.190\nand then just said hey, let's go for it.\n\n428\n00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:30.409\n>> All right, ladies and\ngentlemen, another great episode!\n\n429\n00:25:30.409 --> 00:25:31.800\nAnd hope you enjoyed watching!\n\n430\n00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.320\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n431\n00:25:34.320 -->

00:00:16.530\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.870\nAnd Sean in this episode,\nwe're gonna be taking a look at Open Vuze,\n\n5\n00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.640\nwhich is a vulnerability scanning utility,\nright?\n\n6\n00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.850\n>> Yes indeed it is.\n\n7\n00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.590\nIt's one of the, it falls squarely in\nthat class of vulnerability scanners.\n\n8\n00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.810\nAnd so we've seen vulnerability\nscanners before and\n\n9\n00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.790\nInteresting that they take\nmany different forms.\n\n10\n00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.070\nIn the past we've seen Nessus,\nwe've seen Nexpose,\n\n11\n00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.340\nbut those are just pure\nvulnerability scanners.\n\n12\n00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.160\nThat's all they're designed to do.\n\n13\n00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.200\nBut we also have ones like Core Impact,\nand Canvas, and stuff like that.\n\n14\n00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.020\nThen we have web vulnerability scanners\nand application vulnerability scanners.\n\n15\n00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.540\nAnd you keep going on and\non and on like this.\n\n16\n00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.350\nWell, open vas fits really\nsquarely in that first\n\n17\n00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.330\npart of it where Nexus and\nNexpose kind of reside.\n\n18\n00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.020\nIn fact,\nif you haven't picked this up in the past.\n\n19\n00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.810\nAnd they want, when we talked about it,\nwhen we mentioned Open Vuze you know,\n\n20\n00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.330\nwe're finally gonna take a look at it.\n\n21\n00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.470\nNesus is, the cousin of Open Vuze.\n\n22\n00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.920\nYou know what happened is when\nthe originally designed Nessus you know,\n\n23\n00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.040\nit was one, it was one product\nat some point they said,\n\n24\n00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.040\nwell Nessus we're gonna wanna\nmake a fee based version of it.\n\n25\n00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.490\nThat includes additional features and\nall that stuff.\n\n26\n00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.520\nIt was actually they were wanting\nto include these features as well.\n\n27\n00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.760\nWe are going to have to start charging for\nit because there is so\n\n28\n00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.620\nmuch involved in producing this.\n\n29\n00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.920\nBut then the rest of the team said well,\n\n30\n00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.140\nthere that we're gonna create Open Vuze,\nkeep it free.\n\n31\n00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.100\nSo what happened is that it\nwent two different directions.\n\n32\n00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.670\nSo you have this fork where you\nhave these things that are cousins,\n\n33\n00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.110\nand they have the same common ancestry,\nbut It kind of ends there.\n\n34\n00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.960\nWhen you look at the two,\nyeah, they grew up as one.\n\n35\n00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.420\nAnd then, you know,\nthere's two separate products, now.\n\n36\n00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.670\nDon't expect them to look the same.\n\n37\n00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.738\nNessus is a lot more polished.\n\n38\n00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:22.042\nYou get that benefit when you're paying\nthat amount of money for a year.\n\n39\n00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:25.174\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For maintenance and stuff like that.\n\n40\n00:02:25.174 --> 00:02:28.450\nOpen Vuze doesn't\nnecessarily look as pretty,\n\n41\n00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.990\nbut it's not one of those things that oh,\nit doesn't look pretty and\n\n42\n00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.160\nI'm not gonna use it, actually is\nquite powerful in it's own right.\n\n43\n00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.560\nSo, I kinda wanna go through and\nmake sure you're aware of that.\n\n44\n00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.750\nIf you wanna use an SS after this,\nyes there is still is a community edition,\n\n45\n00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.210\nit's still perfectly valid to use that.\n\n46\n00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.260\nHey, if that's kind of your cup of tea,\nyou want to use an expose, which, there\n\n47\n00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.300\nare some benefits that an expose has over\nother vulnerability scanners, because,\n\n48\n00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.970\nbeing a Rapid 7, and Meta Split is a Rapid\n7 product, you get the integration between\n\n49\n00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.650\nthe two, which is something we\ndon't really get in other areas.\n\n50\n00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.680\nSo, that's one of the benefits it has so\nthere's that.\n\n51\n00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.230\nBut if you wanna just use OpenVAS,\nOpenVAS is right in Kali Linux 2.0.\n\n52\n00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.550\nIt's not a new vulnerability\nscanner by any means.\n\n53\n00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.530\nBut it's something that they\njust really put in here, and\n\n54\n00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.060\nmade it easier to configure, which was one\nof the things we're going to go through.\n\n55\n00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.520\nYou have to go through configuring it and\nhow to use it.\n\n56\n00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.460\nAnd then, once you've got that,\nit does kind of tend to look\n\n57\n00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.170\nlike some of the other vulnerability\nscanners as far as what it does.\n\n58\n00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.640\nThe buttons may be different places and\nstuff like that.\n\n59\n00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.700\nBut probably,\nthe thing that's gonna be the bear for\n\n60\n00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.700\nyou is actually configuring it.\n\n61\n00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.330\nSo I'm gonna configure it for you.\n\n62\n00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.721\nI have run some scans, so we don't have to\nsit there and be like, oh, when's this,\n\n63\n00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:43.237\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n64\n00:03:43.237 --> 00:03:43.869\n>> Gonna be done?\n\n65\n00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:45.822\nThis is a seven hour episode,\nwhat the heck.\n\n66\n00:03:45.822 --> 00:03:51.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So I've got some scans in here.\n\n67\n00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.290\nWe'll take a look at those\nactual scans to see, you know,\n\n68\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.380\nwhat they look like and\nall that good stuff.\n\n69\n00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.220\nWhat a real scan looks like\nagainst a real system.\n\n70\n00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.670\nYou can see,\nyou can get the deal what Openvas is.\n\n71\n00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.910\nHopefully, it's something that you'll\nlike and continue to use afterwards,\n\n72\n00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.080\nor at least something that you use with\nyour other vulnerability scanners.\n\n73\n00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.960\n>> And you've mentioned several times,\nSean, that it's always good to have more\n\n74\n00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.220\nthan one tool that can do the same thing,\nfor the reasons of maybe one,\n\n75\n00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.570\ndoesn't work in this scenario so\nyou've got another one to fall back to.\n\n76\n00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.580\nOr a company wants to give\nyou two different reports.\n\n77\n00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.990\nAnd sometimes even with\nvulnerability scanners and\n\n78\n00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.790\nother things,\nyou could get different results.\n\n79\n00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.790\nAnd we can learn a lot from\nthe combination of those results.\n\n80\n00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.530\n>> Yeah, I'm a big, big advocate,\nas Mike said about that, is\n\n81\n00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.120\nthat I always like to have more than one\nin the tool in any area available to me.\n\n82\n00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.930\nI like at least to have three to five in\nany one area, to give me that flexibility,\n\n83\n00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.350\nthat versatility, just in case one decides\nto have a bad day, take the day off, or\n\n84\n00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.890\nit's just not gonna cut it for\nme in that situation.\n\n85\n00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.070\nOr if I just need to do a sanity\ncheck to make sure that\n\n86\n00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.000\nwhat's being spit out of one,\nis actually what's really happening.\n\n87\n00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.720\nYou will run into situations where\nwhat comes out of one just is,\n\n88\n00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.620\nthat doesn't sound right or look right.\n\n89\n00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.720\nLet me double check.\n\n90\n00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:20.530\nI've told clients in the past as far as\nthat goes, and the running multiple tools.\n\n91\n00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.140\nI've told clients in the past,\nwell maybe things have taken a little bit\n\n92\n00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.939\nlonger when I have that luxury\nof taking a little bit longer.\n\n93\n00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:33.320\nI'm making sure I double and triple\ncheck everything, which I do anyway.\n\n94\n00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.920\nBut I will give them both reports,\nand if they look and go hey,\n\n95\n00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.140\nyou gave us two reports for this stuff,\n\n96\n00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.090\nand you've given us two copies of a scan\nor something, it's like, why's that?\n\n97\n00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.210\nWell, it's just because I wanna make sure\nit's tested under different conditions,\n\n98\n00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.100\nand make sure that,\njust for everyone's benefit,\n\n99\n00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.800\nthat everything kinda lines\nup the way it's supposed to.\n\n100\n00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.740\n>> Trust but verify.\n\n101\n00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.955\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n102\n00:05:57.955 --> 00:05:59.245\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> My favorite saying.\n\n103\n00:05:59.245 --> 00:05:59.940\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well,\n\n104\n00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.790\nlet's take a look at this OpenVAS and\nsee what kinda fun we can have.\n\n105\n00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:03.380\n>> Okay, yeah.\n\n106\n00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.990\nSo OpenVAS, so\nwe know it's a vulnerability scanner.\n\n107\n00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.180\nAnd so,\n\n108\n00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.120\nit has some things in common with the\nother vulnerability scanners we've seen.\n\n109\n00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:20.370\nIf I were to borrow something like Nessus\nor Nexpose, cuz we've seen both of those.\n\n110\n00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.260\nIf we look at those two,\nwhat do we have to do when we set it up?\n\n111\n00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.330\nHad to set up a user account,\nyou had to update the thing,\n\n112\n00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.495\nyou had to register them both.\n\n113\n00:06:28.495 --> 00:06:31.510\nOpenVas, you don't have to register and\nactivate i,\n\n114\n00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.740\nbut you do have to do some of the set up.\n\n115\n00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.750\nAnd this is probably, if anything,\nis gonna really, kinda,\n\n116\n00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.460\nI shouldn't say stump a lot of people.\n\n117\n00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.020\nIt's not that bad.\n\n118\n00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.970\nIt's something that, if you're used to the\nother, sexier looking ones, you're used\n\n119\n00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.360\nto just being able to push a button and\nopen up a GUI and type stuff in, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.320\nLittle more than that, but\nheck, we don't need that.\n\n121\n00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.810\nWe're advanced people now.\n\n122\n00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.265\nWe've We don't need no stinking GUIs.\n\n123\n00:06:58.265 --> 00:07:00.509\n>> [LAUGH] We learn from the best.\n\n124\n00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:01.320\n>> [LAUGH] Well I\n\n125\n00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.157\ndon't know why I'm here [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n126\n00:07:03.157 --> 00:07:05.460\n>> Well in any case, so\n\n127\n00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.890\nwhat I have here is this,\nI'm gonna go into the application menu.\n\n128\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.540\nAnd there's my vulnerability analysis,\none of my favorites, my second category.\n\n129\n00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.970\nYou'll see that we have the three\nentries for OpenVas right now.\n\n130\n00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:25.510\nOkay, now what we have got to do is, when\n\n131\n00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:30.300\nyou start up OpenVas you're going to\nhave to do a setup for the thing.\n\n132\n00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:36.770\nWell, guess what, they got a button\nthere that says, OpenVas initial setup.\n\n133\n00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.770\nGee, I wonder what that's meant for.\n\n134\n00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.215\n>> Probably the last step, right?\n\n135\n00:07:40.215 --> 00:07:42.860\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\nthat's the last thing you're gonna do.\n\n136\n00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.940\nSo what we'll do is we will go ahead and\nstart that up, and\n\n137\n00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.433\nwhat it will do is I have\nalready run this for you.\n\n138\n00:07:50.433 --> 00:07:54.846\nSo it's very quickly going through,\nyou know, going through the whole deal.\n\n139\n00:07:54.846 --> 00:07:59.310\nBut what will happen is that the first\ntime you run this Go out for lunch, or\n\n140\n00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.982\ndinner, or whatever,\ncuz it's gonna take a little while,\n\n141\n00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:07.650\nbecause what it's doing is the same\nthing that Nessus and Nexpose does.\n\n142\n00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:12.580\nIt's actually downloading\nthe latest databases, and\n\n143\n00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.100\nknown vulnerabilities, and\nshoving it into the product.\n\n144\n00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.350\nAnd then you can see on here,\nit's even updated indices, and caches in\n\n145\n00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:24.300\nthe database, and clearing that stuff out,\nthe old stuff, and putting new stuff in.\n\n146\n00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.940\nAnd it's, like I said, it is gonna take\nsome time the first time you do it.\n\n147\n00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.370\nI-\n>> Yeah, you can really see on your\n\n148\n00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.980\noutput there, it's skipping most\nof those cuz you already ran it.\n\n149\n00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.440\nIt's saying hey, you've got\nthe latest version of these files.\n\n150\n00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.280\nBut if you're just setting this up,\nyou've just installed Kali and\n\n151\n00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.730\nyou're just running this for the first\ntime, it's gonna have a lot of work to do.\n\n152\n00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:45.370\n>> Yeah, it will, and\ndepending on how out of date you are,\n\n153\n00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.290\nor just a number of factors.\n\n154\n00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:55.340\nMore than likely how far a date you are,\nthis could take some serious time.\n\n155\n00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:02.186\nThe first time I ran this,\nit took about 20, 30 minutes to do.\n\n156\n00:09:02.186 --> 00:09:06.421\nAnd so it was interesting,\nto say the least, that it took that.\n\n157\n00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:11.504\nBut remember what I said when we we did\nthe initial set up of Kali, as I said,\n\n158\n00:09:11.504 --> 00:09:16.590\nthat you want to do is go through these\ntools, and check to see that they're\n\n159\n00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:21.150\nup to date and that you have\nthe databases and all that downloaded.\n\n160\n00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.640\nThis would be one case where you do that.\n\n161\n00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.260\nBut it shouldn't be something\nthat's unfamiliar to you\n\n162\n00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.820\nbased on the fact that you're\nusing Nessus and Nexpose.\n\n163\n00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:33.320\nNessus, once you activate it,\nyou could be talking to 10, 15 minutes or\n\n164\n00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.230\nmore as it goes through and\ndownloads the stuff and gets ready.\n\n165\n00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.550\nAfter that it's just going through and\ndoing this.\n\n166\n00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:47.599\nI did this update of it yesterday evening\nand so it downloaded all that stuff.\n\n167\n00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.680\nWe're not even full day past that yet,\n\n168\n00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.350\nand you can see it did\ntake some time to do it.\n\n169\n00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.720\nJust tells you, their vulnerabilities\ncome out all the time.\n\n170\n00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.970\nSo always make it a point of making\nsure this database is up to date.\n\n171\n00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.405\nSo, it's done, it's updated,\nall the caches, and all that stuff.\n\n172\n00:10:05.405 --> 00:10:08.260\nSo heck, that's great, so\nwe're ready to move on.\n\n173\n00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.110\nOnce we've done the initial setup we're\nready to move on to the next step.\n\n174\n00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:15.322\nThe next step in here,\n\n175\n00:10:15.322 --> 00:10:20.510\nlet me close this just to make sure we're\nall being nice and fair about this.\n\n176\n00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.830\nIt is a service that runs in the\nbackground, and what you'll have to do is\n\n177\n00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:30.950\nyou'll have to run the appropriately\ntitle OpenVAS start.\n\n178\n00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.310\nThat's going to go ahead and\n\n179\n00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:37.120\nstart the services in the background\nto make this thing run.\n\n180\n00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.926\nIts OpenVAS's version\nof a Avengers Assemble.\n\n181\n00:10:39.926 --> 00:10:44.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just in case, I know pop culture,\n\n182\n00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.730\ndon't mess with me.\n\n183\n00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.690\nIt started up, okay.\n\n184\n00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:55.450\nNow, here's the part where it's gonna\nmess people up on this is that they're\n\n185\n00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:56.550\nright there on the menu, right.\n\n186\n00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:02.030\nSays applications,\nvulnerability, OpenVAS start.\n\n187\n00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.150\nWhat happened?\n\n188\n00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.170\nWhat do I do now?\n\n189\n00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:08.220\nIt said starting OpenVAS services,\nand now, what?\n\n190\n00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.640\nWhat am I gonna do now?\n\n191\n00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.570\nWell, you gotta start the thing up.\n\n192\n00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:14.970\nThat's not the way you do it.\n\n193\n00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.610\nThat starts the background service.\n\n194\n00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:20.910\nThat does not get you to the point\nwhere you're gonna get a GUI up to use.\n\n195\n00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.610\nYou sit here and\nwait as long as you want and\n\n196\n00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.850\nit ain't coming up,\nyou still have something you gotta do.\n\n197\n00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.100\nWhat you're gonna have to do is,\nyou can start up your browser,\n\n198\n00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.450\nwhatever browser that you want.\n\n199\n00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.360\nAnd, what you'll do is,\nif you started up the actual service like\n\n200\n00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.790\nyou're supposed to,\nyou click Open Buzz, Start.\n\n201\n00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:43.980\nYou'll get this actual GUI coming up.\n\n202\n00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.440\nNow, I'll go ahead an hit Refresh and\nhere,\n\n203\n00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.150\nyou can see okay, it logged me out,\ncuz it says session expired.\n\n204\n00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:56.920\nThe way you're gonna get to this page,\njust to make sure we're all nice and\n\n205\n00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.867\nclear and cool on this,\nis you're gonna type in https:// and\n\n206\n00:12:01.867 --> 00:12:06.629\nthen the IP address of your system,\nyou can type in what I did,\n\n207\n00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:08.857\nthe 127, the loop back.\n\n208\n00:12:08.857 --> 00:12:14.078\nAnd, just remember, you can type in the IP\naddress or the host name in the system,\n\n209\n00:12:14.078 --> 00:12:19.475\nand then colon, it's always gonna be that\n9392, and it will bring up this GUI.\n\n210\n00:12:19.475 --> 00:12:26.865\nNow, once you bring up this log on page,\nso we'll type in the username,\n\n211\n00:12:26.865 --> 00:12:33.060\nyou type in your password, and\nit should just go up and say, boom.\n\n212\n00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.530\nIt comes in right to this.\n\n213\n00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:39.840\nLet me tell you what, I kind of pulled\na little bit of a fast one here on you.\n\n214\n00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.090\nLet me kind of show you there's something\n\n215\n00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.360\nthat is going to cause a little bit of\nfrustration there if you're not careful.\n\n216\n00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:52.120\nOkay, you have a user account set\nup in there, an Admin account,\n\n217\n00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.620\nI set up one called Shawn for me.\n\n218\n00:12:54.620 --> 00:13:00.188\nWell, you can, if you need to set up\na user account, there's a command called\n\n219\n00:13:00.188 --> 00:13:05.410\nOpenVAS md and if you hit it,\nit doesn't do anything like this, right.\n\n220\n00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:09.760\nWhat you gotta do is, well let me\njust kind of do the help on it.\n\n221\n00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:14.580\nThere's actually a command in\nhere where you can do OpenVAS and\n\n222\n00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.730\ndo new user, and\njust give the name of a user account.\n\n223\n00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.500\nSo I went ahead, and\nlet me just type it out for\n\n224\n00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:28.340\nyou, I did OpenVAS md and\n\n225\n00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.300\nI typed in the name of a user, so\n\n226\n00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:37.800\nyou see the user right there, and then\njust type in the name of your account.\n\n227\n00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.990\nI won't run that cuz I already have\n[LAUGH] an account already created\n\n228\n00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:41.870\nlike that.\n\n229\n00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:46.280\nBut once you do that, it's going to say,\nokay I created user, but\n\n230\n00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:51.640\nit's also going to spit out\na long string of numbers.\n\n231\n00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.800\nAnd you can choose to\nreset the password here or\n\n232\n00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.600\nyou could choose to just copy and\npaste that password.\n\n233\n00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.180\nYou can type in a user name and\n\n234\n00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.990\ncopy that long string of characters\ninto that password field and hit log in.\n\n235\n00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:04.170\nIt will log in.\n\n236\n00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:10.190\nI recommend that you choose to reset that\npassword as soon as you get a chance,\n\n237\n00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:13.090\nwhether you do it through here or\ncopy and paste that and\n\n238\n00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.220\nput it in, change that password.\n\n239\n00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.350\nBecause that password is like this long,\nit's alphanumeric, it looks like a hash.\n\n240\n00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:23.160\nSo unless you're really good,\nyou're some savant or something,\n\n241\n00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.850\nI'd really recommend you change\nthat as quickly as possible.\n\n242\n00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:32.680\nThe way you do that once you log in is you\ngot all your management tools up here.\n\n243\n00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.790\nHere's your administration stuff.\n\n244\n00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:41.770\nYou could actually go administration users\nand you could see the two accounts I have.\n\n245\n00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:46.990\nYou could just click on that and\nthen there's a little wrench icon there.\n\n246\n00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:52.570\nClick on the user name, click on the\nwrench, and then just do, click on it and\n\n247\n00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.000\nit'll say, okay what do you\nwant to set for the password?\n\n248\n00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.960\nObviously I'm not going to\nchange the password here.\n\n249\n00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.240\nI've already done that I'm in.\n\n250\n00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:03.030\nI don't need to [LAUGH] any reason for\nme to do that, but I really\n\n251\n00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:07.630\nstrongly recommend you change to something\nthat's more reasonable for it if you do.\n\n252\n00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:08.390\nOr who knows?\n\n253\n00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.670\nMaybe you're just like no,\nI'm not changing it.\n\n254\n00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.200\nI'm leaving it with that long character.\n\n255\n00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.710\nI wanna be different.\n\n256\n00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.970\n>> And then you have to make a new account\nevery time you need to get in there.\n\n257\n00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.395\n>> Yeah, do it that way,\nthat's a good approach.\n\n258\n00:15:18.395 --> 00:15:24.210\n[LAUGH] But, so, I have logged into this.\n\n259\n00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:29.840\nYou can see they call, they've got this\ngreen boned deal up here that's set up.\n\n260\n00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.432\nIt's actually the name of the company and\nall that sets this thing up.\n\n261\n00:15:34.432 --> 00:15:39.740\nI've got four scans down here that I've\ndropped IP addresses in ahead of time.\n\n262\n00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:44.537\nSo it says, okay, I've run these scans,\nthis one was stopped\n\n263\n00:15:44.537 --> 00:15:49.620\nbefore we started up here, so\nI can go ahead and keep that running.\n\n264\n00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.306\nBut what I have is when you click on it,\nso\n\n265\n00:15:52.306 --> 00:15:55.392\nthere's my actual number\nof scans I've run.\n\n266\n00:15:55.392 --> 00:15:59.423\nYou can see that this one is an orange,\nit's actually going ahead and running.\n\n267\n00:15:59.423 --> 00:16:04.450\nThat 98 is Mike's system over here,\nso it may take some time to do that.\n\n268\n00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.360\nWe don't need to wait for that.\n\n269\n00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.990\nIf it's done before\nwe're done talking here.\n\n270\n00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.197\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll take a quick glance.\n\n271\n00:16:12.197 --> 00:16:15.847\nWe've got some other scans here\nset up just for this purpose, so\n\n272\n00:16:15.847 --> 00:16:18.120\nwe don't have to wait for it.\n\n273\n00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.040\nNow you can just go into this and\nif you click on this,\n\n274\n00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.790\ngo to the main page for this.\n\n275\n00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:31.320\nIn with this are, actually go to your scan\nmanagement, I have these scans in here.\n\n276\n00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.490\nI can type my own end,\n\n277\n00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:38.450\nI got these existing ones in here if\nI click on this scan for example.\n\n278\n00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:43.190\nIt says okay, it ran it, it's given\nme the high level information on it,\n\n279\n00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.090\nwhich is great.\n\n280\n00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.550\nIt's done,\nfound a system on the other side of it.\n\n281\n00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:49.760\nOkay so we've got that information.\n\n282\n00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.146\nIf you want to take a look at\nwhat actually happened there,\n\n283\n00:16:52.146 --> 00:16:53.420\nit does have this reports tab.\n\n284\n00:16:55.095 --> 00:16:58.595\nAnd there's the scans that have been run.\n\n285\n00:16:58.595 --> 00:17:03.135\nAnd you can just click on any one\nof these and open up that scan.\n\n286\n00:17:03.135 --> 00:17:05.175\nWell this one,\nthere was nothing valid behind it.\n\n287\n00:17:05.175 --> 00:17:07.957\nI think I've got one in in here.\n\n288\n00:17:07.957 --> 00:17:10.703\nI was really playing around a lot\napparently before we started.\n\n289\n00:17:10.703 --> 00:17:13.574\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay,\n\n290\n00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:15.217\nI've got some stuff that has results here.\n\n291\n00:17:15.217 --> 00:17:17.137\nI can see that it's got\nwhen I go down the column,\n\n292\n00:17:17.137 --> 00:17:19.587\nthese have some numbers\nother than zero in here.\n\n293\n00:17:19.587 --> 00:17:23.267\nTells me that it found something\nback there, so that's good, so\n\n294\n00:17:23.267 --> 00:17:28.350\nI will click on that and it's telling\nme the stuff that it actually ran.\n\n295\n00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:30.200\nHere's the problems that it found, and\n\n296\n00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:35.420\nyou can actually click on these things,\nand see, hey, this is what we found.\n\n297\n00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.900\nWell all I scanned here, just for\n\n298\n00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:40.790\nthe record, it says it's a Linux kernel,\nand all that.\n\n299\n00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.710\nHey yeah, it is a Linux kernel.\n\n300\n00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.920\nIt's the other Kali system I was\nshowing from our previous episode,\n\n301\n00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.270\nI just left it open and running.\n\n302\n00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:54.180\nSo that's actually 100%\ncorrect that it did that.\n\n303\n00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:59.260\nNow if you want to change\nthe nature of a scan,\n\n304\n00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.730\nyou can do a quick scan but\ntype in the IP address.\n\n305\n00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.510\nBut you can also go in here and\n\n306\n00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:08.240\nthey have these task wizards, which\nare just like anything else in Windows.\n\n307\n00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.560\nThe quick start one would\nbe just type it in.\n\n308\n00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.960\nThe IP address you want,\nno frills, nothing.\n\n309\n00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.600\nYou just type it in and boom.\n\n310\n00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.160\nIt's gonna go ahead and run.\n\n311\n00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:22.543\nIf that is not gonna work for you which\nI totally understand if it doesn't,\n\n312\n00:18:22.543 --> 00:18:25.630\nyou've got that magic wand icon up there.\n\n313\n00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:28.020\nYou can do the advanced task wizard.\n\n314\n00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.730\nAnd you can do just like you do in Nessus.\n\n315\n00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.910\nYou can schedule it for in the future.\n\n316\n00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:36.020\nYou can tell it what type of\nstuff you want to have it do.\n\n317\n00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.320\nGive it additional credentials.\n\n318\n00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.670\nSo it can do additional and\nmore in depth scanning with that.\n\n319\n00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:45.290\nSo it's doing a lot of stuff we would\nexpect a vulnerability scanner to do.\n\n320\n00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:49.352\nAnd just also for the record here,\none of the things that Nessus and\n\n321\n00:18:49.352 --> 00:18:54.405\nother vulnerability scanners can do,\nis they can scan ranges of IPs.\n\n322\n00:18:54.405 --> 00:18:57.455\nBut a lot of them put limits on that.\n\n323\n00:18:57.455 --> 00:19:01.455\nThis one, you can put a range of IPs in\nthere and it has an upper limit on it.\n\n324\n00:19:01.455 --> 00:19:03.185\nI forget what it is off\nthe top of my head, but\n\n325\n00:19:03.185 --> 00:19:06.215\nit's higher than it is for\nNessus and Nexpose.\n\n326\n00:19:06.215 --> 00:19:11.700\nSo if you want to be able to not have to\nbreak up your scan to chunks, and you\n\n327\n00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:17.170\nshouldn't be actually using Nexpose, or\nNessus with limitations to do that anyway.\n\n328\n00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.170\nThose are the free educational ones so\nyou're not suppose to use it for\n\n329\n00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.440\ncommercial stuff.\n\n330\n00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.210\nSo if you're doing tests or something and\n\n331\n00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:28.540\nlet's say theoretically you're using\nthose, which I'm not saying you should.\n\n332\n00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:32.110\nYou'd have to get the commercial\nversion and pay that.\n\n333\n00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:36.398\nI think Nessus is something like\n$5,000 a year for maintenance and\n\n334\n00:19:36.398 --> 00:19:39.220\nall that on end support for\nthe commercial one.\n\n335\n00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:41.960\nThis one, it's free.\n\n336\n00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:46.000\nAnd you can type that in and scan that\n\n337\n00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.750\nexact same range without that limitation\non it and it's ready for commercial use.\n\n338\n00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:51.630\n>> Nice.\n>> So\n\n339\n00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.410\nthat's a benefit of using\nthis one over the other ones.\n\n340\n00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:58.990\nIt may not necessarily be as pretty, but\nit does do the same things, and does break\n\n341\n00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:04.450\nthrough some of those limitations that\nyou'd have to pay more dollars for.\n\n342\n00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:08.080\nI'm not saying that this\nis better than Nessus.\n\n343\n00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:13.271\nNessus has its own advantages\nover what OpenVAS has.\n\n344\n00:20:13.271 --> 00:20:18.070\nBut OpenVAS can give you some of those\nthings that you'd have to really kinda\n\n345\n00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:21.270\nfork over the cash to make that happen.\n\n346\n00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:26.390\nSo gotta love that.\n\n347\n00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:29.760\nSo you can tag on notes to your scans.\n\n348\n00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.550\nYou can do all sorts of\ninteresting stuff with it.\n\n349\n00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.070\nYou can do asset management through here.\n\n350\n00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.860\nIt's got plugs into different databases.\n\n351\n00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:39.790\nI really like this.\n\n352\n00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:44.022\nThis is something that Nessus has but\ndoesn't necessarily do the same way.\n\n353\n00:20:44.022 --> 00:20:48.212\nIs that it actually tells\nyou about different types of\n\n354\n00:20:48.212 --> 00:20:51.200\nvulnerabilities that are out there.\n\n355\n00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.840\nYou can search on vulnerabilities.\n\n356\n00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.280\nSo Nessus you can do it.\n\n357\n00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:01.190\nBut Nessus is a little more\nhoops to jump through.\n\n358\n00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:04.710\nAnd I think for most people it's kind of\nlimited what Nessus and Nexpose will do.\n\n359\n00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:08.520\nYou have to go to Google or use one of\nthe other tools to search a database.\n\n360\n00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.730\nThis one, it downloads those databases,\nbut you could also say well,\n\n361\n00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:16.480\nlet me search through those and see\nthe types of things associated with that.\n\n362\n00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:20.450\nI really like that, that it can\ndo the vulnerability scan for us,\n\n363\n00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:25.400\nwhich we just saw in those ones I ran for\nyou ahead of time.\n\n364\n00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.830\nBut I can also search\nthrough this database.\n\n365\n00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:31.150\nI've got an application in there or\napplication or operating system.\n\n366\n00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:33.620\nAnd I can type some\ncharacteristics with it in there.\n\n367\n00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.080\nAnd it will tell me,\nhey this is what I found.\n\n368\n00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:40.280\nAnd you click on it and it will give\nyou information on that and tell you.\n\n369\n00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.630\nYou can see in here how severe\nthis actual problem is.\n\n370\n00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:46.600\nAnd just go right on through.\n\n371\n00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.600\nYou kinda gotta really like that.\n\n372\n00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.770\nLike I said, I really like the fact\nthat it's all integrated right in there.\n\n373\n00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:52.530\n>> Absolutely.\n\n374\n00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.610\nIf I can take that report and see those\nvulnerabilities and then come right over\n\n375\n00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:58.760\nhere and actually get a break down\nof what those vulnerabilities are.\n\n376\n00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.670\nAnd that's gonna help me with my risk\nmanagement, trying to determine is\n\n377\n00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:06.390\nthis something I need to worry about, or\nis this something I can just forget about.\n\n378\n00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.200\nIt's very nice.\n\n379\n00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:13.200\n>> Yeah it's pretty nice which is why\nwe're giving you this look at it because\n\n380\n00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:19.100\nit's one of these things that, it's one\nof these tools that you hear about.\n\n381\n00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:23.295\nBut once people see that it takes all\nthese extra hoops to jump through,\n\n382\n00:22:23.295 --> 00:22:27.120\nthey're are kind of like well, Nessus\nis over there or Nexpose is over there.\n\n383\n00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.659\nThere is any one number of ones that got a\nnice pretty sexy GUI that I can go in and\n\n384\n00:22:30.659 --> 00:22:31.405\ndo stuff with.\n\n385\n00:22:31.405 --> 00:22:33.070\nThey're like I'll just use those.\n\n386\n00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.680\nI don't got time to really mess with this.\n\n387\n00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.390\nI want you to know that not only does\nKali 2.0 put this right in there, and\n\n388\n00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:44.260\nmake it easier to do some of these things,\nthe updates and stuff like that process,\n\n389\n00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.550\nyou had to do in the past with this.\n\n390\n00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:49.145\nThey weren't gonna put something\nright there on a menu saying saying\n\n391\n00:22:49.145 --> 00:22:52.145\nyou can click on it and it would run\nthe commands for you automatically.\n\n392\n00:22:52.145 --> 00:22:55.635\nYou had to go through and remember\nthose or write your own script for it.\n\n393\n00:22:55.635 --> 00:22:58.905\nSo they've made it easier to\nget into it with Kali 2.0,\n\n394\n00:22:58.905 --> 00:23:02.955\nwhich you gotta really love that\nfact that it keeps it in there,\n\n395\n00:23:02.955 --> 00:23:05.945\nthat it's more than capable\nof doing these things.\n\n396\n00:23:05.945 --> 00:23:08.785\nYou just gotta be willing to put\na little extra elbow grease in than\n\n397\n00:23:08.785 --> 00:23:11.825\nyou may have to do with Nessus.\n\n398\n00:23:11.825 --> 00:23:16.070\nAnd the fact that it's free, and\n\n399\n00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:19.190\nyou don't have those limitations\nthat Nessus puts on you.\n\n400\n00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:21.840\nOr Tenable puts in with Nessus or\nanybody else.\n\n401\n00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.910\nI kind of really like that, myself.\n\n402\n00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:26.030\nI really really like that.\n\n403\n00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:27.730\nIt's just a great thing.\n\n404\n00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:31.366\n>> Yeah, free is one of my\nfavorite features of any program.\n\n405\n00:23:31.366 --> 00:23:32.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n406\n00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.460\nWell, Sean, that's fantastic.\n\n407\n00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:41.080\nGreat look at OpenVAS, a vulnerability\nscanner that's built right in to Kali 2.0.\n\n408\n00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.190\nRelatively easy now that we've\nseen a professional do it.\n\n409\n00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:46.560\nRelatively easy to get it going,\nget it up and running, and\n\n410\n00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.350\nstart doing those vulnerability scans.\n\n411\n00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.896\nAnd as Sean's said, it's got the power.\n\n412\n00:23:50.896 --> 00:23:55.463\nIn fact, in some respects, a little more\npower than the community edition of some\n\n413\n00:23:55.463 --> 00:23:58.718\nof those other programs, so\nWhat's not to love about it?\n\n414\n00:23:58.718 --> 00:24:02.458\nYou've got it at your fingertips time to\nget out there and start playing with it,\n\n415\n00:24:02.458 --> 00:24:04.790\nget use to it, and put it in your toolkit.\n\n416\n00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:08.020\nSo Shawn anything else we want to talk\nabout before we wrap this one up?\n\n417\n00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.844\n>> Yeah, let me just put a little,\n\n418\n00:24:09.844 --> 00:24:13.560\nmake sure there's a period to end\nthat sentance or a footnote, or\n\n419\n00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.200\nwhatever you want to call it\n>> You know I said it and\n\n420\n00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:21.650\nMike just reiterated it to\nmake it really really clear,\n\n421\n00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:26.050\nyou can use the Nessus in Nexpose and\nother community additions or\n\n422\n00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:30.310\nthose which they call the free editions, a\nlot of people call them the free editions.\n\n423\n00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:34.100\nThose are not meant for\ncommercial use in a lot of cases.\n\n424\n00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.750\nSo if you go and use those things,\n\n425\n00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:41.180\nyou're actually violating the license\nagreement that they give you.\n\n426\n00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:47.230\nSo if you're using Nessus and\nNexpose to follow along with like\n\n427\n00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:52.040\nthe ethical hacking stuff we've done here,\nthe forensics, or to compare against this,\n\n428\n00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.990\nthat's fine, to do research and\nyour own education on that.\n\n429\n00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:56.870\nThat's what they're meant for.\n\n430\n00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:59.790\nBut you cannot use this\npart of a pen test.\n\n431\n00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:04.790\nIf you're caught doing that,\nit's not impossible that they could say,\n\n432\n00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:09.160\nyeah, guess what, open up your checkbook\nand write us this amount of money.\n\n433\n00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.470\nAnd you're kind of stuck because they\ncan take you to court or something for\n\n434\n00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:12.630\nthat at that point.\n\n435\n00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:17.810\nSo do remember that there, those ones,\neven while you might say no, I\n\n436\n00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:22.400\ndon't want to use open vas because there's\nstill too many things I've got to do.\n\n437\n00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.350\nWhatever, I can understand it, you still\nmay not want to do that much work.\n\n438\n00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:30.780\nBut do remember, you got a choice,\nto stay compliant with\n\n439\n00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:35.580\nlicensing which that's how they\nkeep good software out there.\n\n440\n00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:41.690\nYou can stay compliant with licensing, or\nyou can use something this is free and\n\n441\n00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:44.760\nuse it for your commercial stuff and\nstill be obeying your license and\n\n442\n00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:49.490\nhave with a few exceptions here and\nthere you could still be\n\n443\n00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:54.340\nwell within the range of the power\nyou need that those other guys have.\n\n444\n00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:55.250\n>> Very good.\n\n445\n00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:59.260\nExactly, licensing you\ncannot get away from that.\n\n446\n00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:03.970\n>> The thing I would add to that\nis it's very easy to violate that\n\n447\n00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:05.860\ntype of things, you know.\n\n448\n00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.150\nI've had it when, I didn't even think\nabout it when I've been, you know,\n\n449\n00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:13.120\nteaching classes and stuff like that, I'll\njust grab some piece of virtualization\n\n450\n00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.030\nsoftware, you know, for example.\n\n451\n00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:18.290\nAnd I'm just like using it, it's like,\noh wait a minute, that's saying,\n\n452\n00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:19.520\nI gotta pay for that.\n\n453\n00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:24.530\nBecause it's no longer me just sitting\nin my office at home messing around and\n\n454\n00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.330\nplaying with stuff and doing research.\n\n455\n00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:31.850\nI'm actually teaching a class so\nif I want to do things and be ethical\n\n456\n00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:37.490\nabout the whole thing, I have to cough\nup the money to pay the licensing fee.\n\n457\n00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:38.890\nIt's just the way it works.\n\n458\n00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:42.362\nSo it's very easy so pay attention.\n\n459\n00:26:42.362 --> 00:26:45.415\n>> All right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nwe hope you enjoyed watching this episode.\n\n460\n00:26:45.415 --> 00:26:47.015\nI know we had a great time filming it.\n\n461\n00:26:47.015 --> 00:26:49.365\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n462\n00:26:49.365 -->

and\n\n3\n00:00:14.871 --> 00:00:16.800\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.590\nAnd Sean, in this episode, we're gonna be\ntaking a look at vulnerability scanners.\n\n5\n00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.788\nAnd in particular, we're gonna be looking\nat a couple of web vulnerability scanners\n\n6\n00:00:24.788 --> 00:00:26.372\nthat you have picked out for us.\n\n7\n00:00:26.372 --> 00:00:27.210\nRight?\n\n8\n00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.270\n>> Yes, that's the goal here.\n\n9\n00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.700\nIs that we are taking a look at\nvulnerability scanners of different\n\n10\n00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.860\ntypes here.\n\n11\n00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.880\nI chose Skipfish and\n\n12\n00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.650\nVega because they are ones that\nare more obvious to you in Kali 2.0.\n\n13\n00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.090\nAnd they kind of enhance the existing\ncapabilities that we already have.\n\n14\n00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.010\nSo what we want to do is see why use\nthese ones, what advantages they have.\n\n15\n00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.010\nAnd so these two,\none of them is a command line.\n\n16\n00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.091\nThe other one is gonna be using a GUI.\n\n17\n00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:01.365\nSo it's just kind of to show you,\nand compare and contrast the two.\n\n18\n00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:04.970\nOkay, so, they're both really neat.\n\n19\n00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.790\nThey're very simple.\n\n20\n00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.870\nThey both have their pros and cons, so\n\n21\n00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.240\nwhat we'll do is see what\none offers over the other.\n\n22\n00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.337\nYou can still do other application\nscanning through things like your Nessus,\n\n23\n00:01:18.337 --> 00:01:21.700\nyour Expose, the stuff we\nmentioned in the previous episode,\n\n24\n00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.340\nwith OpenVAS you have that available too.\n\n25\n00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.430\nSo you've still got quite\na few things open to you.\n\n26\n00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.230\nThis is just gonna enhance\nyour existing capability.\n\n27\n00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.250\nSo I think you'll like these things, and\n\n28\n00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.750\nyou'll find them to be something that is a\ngood enhancement to what you already have.\n\n29\n00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.690\nSo what we'll do is,\nto kinda get the ball rolling here,\n\n30\n00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.610\nthe first one we will take a look\nat is gonna be one called Vega.\n\n31\n00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.835\nVega, I've already kind of\nstarted it up for us and\n\n32\n00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:55.146\nI'm letting it kind of do\nits little scanning deal.\n\n33\n00:01:55.146 --> 00:02:00.773\nI've got my own website scan here.\n\n34\n00:02:00.773 --> 00:02:07.725\nAnd so it's gone through and I have\na small demo website that it's scanning.\n\n35\n00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:08.905\nSo it's found some stuff.\n\n36\n00:02:08.905 --> 00:02:12.485\nI also ran a quick, kinda just sweep\nagainst, like a search engine would,\n\n37\n00:02:12.485 --> 00:02:19.590\nagainst USA Today just to show what\nit looks like on two different sites.\n\n38\n00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.430\nAnd so, this stuff, like I said,\nthis stuff is doing kind of what a search\n\n39\n00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.460\nwould do, but it's putting a little\nmore attention on telling you,\n\n40\n00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.760\nhey, types of issues added that it\nfinds that could be a concern to you.\n\n41\n00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.520\n>> So like most of our vulnerability\nscanners, it's got a database,\n\n42\n00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.050\nI'm assuming, of the vulnerabilities and\nit's kinda comparing results against that.\n\n43\n00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.804\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n44\n00:02:38.804 --> 00:02:39.710\n>> NIce.\n\n45\n00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.810\n>> So it can build a pretty\nsubstantial piece of information,\n\n46\n00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.560\na picture on what it finds.\n\n47\n00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.380\nSo I find this to be\na very very handy tool.\n\n48\n00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.650\nIf you're a web application developer,\nor if you've just got a regular website,\n\n49\n00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.930\nwhatever, it can help you find a lot\nof those things that may not be as\n\n50\n00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.450\nobvious to you and\nstuff that you want to take care of.\n\n51\n00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.265\nSo the two websites that I have, I've got\nmy Oriyano.com site, and I've run already.\n\n52\n00:03:06.265 --> 00:03:08.565\nIt's completed, since it's a small site.\n\n53\n00:03:08.565 --> 00:03:15.605\nAnd it's given me an overall report on it,\nsaying, hey, I found some issues here.\n\n54\n00:03:15.605 --> 00:03:19.625\nSo when I go over here is,\nI can just click on that scan, and\n\n55\n00:03:19.625 --> 00:03:23.400\nit says here's a medium issue and\nit says well found an issue, though,\n\n56\n00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.140\nI think something found\na local file system one.\n\n57\n00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.600\nWell, I can look at and see if that's\nreally an issue, and kinda review it, and\n\n58\n00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.360\nthen go look at the source code.\n\n59\n00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.270\nIt's gonna tell me what page and\nlocation it found that in, if possible.\n\n60\n00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.900\nSo, it's finding one here it thinks\nit's actually might be a concern.\n\n61\n00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.659\nSo I can take a look at that to see\nif that's something that needs to\n\n62\n00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:44.660\nbe addressed.\n\n63\n00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.630\nAnd that's good.\n\n64\n00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.370\nIt could be something that you've missed.\n\n65\n00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.160\nIt could be something that's completely\nbenign, no problem whatsoever,\n\n66\n00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.755\nbut it's something that at least I've\ngot information right here telling me,\n\n67\n00:03:56.755 --> 00:04:01.245\nhey this is what I found, and I can decide\nwhat type of action I want to take.\n\n68\n00:04:01.245 --> 00:04:05.665\n>> Yeah a lot better than, at least you\nfound it and you can make the decision\n\n69\n00:04:05.665 --> 00:04:08.880\nrather than the bad guy finding it and\ntaking advantage of it for you.\n\n70\n00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.545\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n71\n00:04:09.545 --> 00:04:12.705\nyou don't want the bad guys\neating your lunch on this at all.\n\n72\n00:04:12.705 --> 00:04:18.970\nSo right now you've got a really\ngood idea looking at this.\n\n73\n00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.010\nAnd this would be just one that\nyou'd just have in your arsenal,\n\n74\n00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.870\nyou do have other vulnerability scanners\nas well that you would want to use, and\n\n75\n00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.310\nsee if they are actually, you know,\ngonna give you different information.\n\n76\n00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.140\nAnd remember, they will give you\ndifferent information sometimes.\n\n77\n00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.270\nJust because one gives you what looks like\na complete picture, doesn't mean that\n\n78\n00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:43.020\nyour, oh great I could just kind of\nclean my hands and say I'm done with it.\n\n79\n00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.260\nRun another one, it may actually\ngive you a different viewpoint, and\n\n80\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.330\nsay well wait a minute,\nhow come that one didn't say it?\n\n81\n00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.490\nWell that one didn't say it because maybe\nthat was overlooked by the developer.\n\n82\n00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.340\nThe same reason you're\nusing something like this,\n\n83\n00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.380\nthe developer could have\nmissed something too.\n\n84\n00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.570\nIn which case you've caught it now.\n\n85\n00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.760\n>> It's a lot like the old spyware we used\nto use where they rely on a database.\n\n86\n00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.920\nAnd I'm sure the different vulnerability\nscanners don't use the same database.\n\n87\n00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.990\nSo if somebody's added a new entry to\none database one company has, the other\n\n88\n00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.410\ncompany might be behind in adding new\ndefinitions or new vulnerabilities.\n\n89\n00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.399\nSo, definitely important to run more than\none to make sure you get the full picture.\n\n90\n00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:21.443\n>> Yeah,\nyou make a really good point on that is,\n\n91\n00:05:21.443 --> 00:05:25.760\nthat the databases don't\nnecessarily have to be the same.\n\n92\n00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.710\nThey do pull information from\na lot of common sources, but\n\n93\n00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.550\nthey also do put their own things into it.\n\n94\n00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.132\nSo, you'll see some of these vulnerability\ndatabases that you could search yourself\n\n95\n00:05:36.132 --> 00:05:37.500\non your own.\n\n96\n00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.730\nThey will sometimes,\nyou go out there and pull the stuff,\n\n97\n00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.770\nthose databases, and\nstick them into their product.\n\n98\n00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.680\nAnd by scanning through multiple databases\nthey can get you a clearer picture.\n\n99\n00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.150\nBut they can also have these other\nthings that they've built on their own.\n\n100\n00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.360\nAnd which case, that knowledge base isn't\nthe same between different vendors.\n\n101\n00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.310\nSo you're going to want to make\nsure that you try different ones.\n\n102\n00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.419\nSo there could be some commonalities.\n\n103\n00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.375\nBut not 100%.\n\n104\n00:06:03.375 --> 00:06:06.640\nDon't expect that.\nIt's always good to do that sanity check\n\n105\n00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.710\nand as we always say here,\ntrust but verify.\n\n106\n00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:16.102\nMake sure that you're actually getting\nthat clear picture that you want.\n\n107\n00:06:16.102 --> 00:06:18.083\n>> Very good.\n>> So I look at this here,\n\n108\n00:06:18.083 --> 00:06:23.190\nI've got a view,\nI've got my website mapped out here.\n\n109\n00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.380\nAnd like I said, it's giving me\nthat picture of things down here.\n\n110\n00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.160\nHere I even have an info one.\n\n111\n00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.140\nI can take a look at that to see,\nwell it says there's something,\n\n112\n00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.600\nit thinks there's a newsfeed there.\n\n113\n00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.100\nI could take a look to see if this is\na problem, and it's saying alrighty this\n\n114\n00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.620\nisn't probably a problem anyway\nbecause it says it's an RSS feed or\n\n115\n00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.890\ndid you mean to have this here or not?\n\n116\n00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.450\nSo you could decide if that's\nsomething that's of interest to you.\n\n117\n00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:54.560\nBut that's just a look at one\nwebsite being scanned with this.\n\n118\n00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.020\nI have scanned something\na little more complicated, or\n\n119\n00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.820\na lot more complicated,\nwhich is actually still going on.\n\n120\n00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.276\nThis one, just FYI, I've actually\nmanipulated these results a bit, too, so\n\n121\n00:07:07.276 --> 00:07:10.549\ndon't go looking, oh,\nUSA Today's got all this stuff.\n\n122\n00:07:10.549 --> 00:07:12.620\nNo, no, no.\nI played with it a bit to make it\n\n123\n00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.540\na little more interesting for\n\n124\n00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.920\nus to show you just the kind of breadth\nof things that could be in there.\n\n125\n00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.040\nAnyway, so what I have,\nas you can see in this one,\n\n126\n00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.510\nwith the results that I've gotten\nfrom here and like I said,\n\n127\n00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:31.970\nI've kinda tweaked them a bit to make it\nmore interesting, to show more stuff.\n\n128\n00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.812\nYou take a look at this one,\nit says it found 202 high errors in here,\n\n129\n00:07:36.812 --> 00:07:39.086\nso that's a little concerning.\n\n130\n00:07:39.086 --> 00:07:43.084\nYou know. [LAUGH] >> That's when I go to\nmy damn team and say, are you working?\n\n131\n00:07:43.084 --> 00:07:46.400\n[LAUGH]\n>> All vacations are cancelled as of now.\n\n132\n00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.192\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I look at this and\n\n133\n00:07:49.192 --> 00:07:53.304\nI could start doing the same thing,\npicking through it.\n\n134\n00:07:53.304 --> 00:07:57.576\nAnd you can see it's really it's\nflagging these things, telling you hey,\n\n135\n00:07:57.576 --> 00:08:01.511\nthis is This is what I found as being\na problem, and it gives you the full\n\n136\n00:08:01.511 --> 00:08:05.912\ndescription in it, and it even, like I\nsaid, it weights them, it tells you,\n\n137\n00:08:05.912 --> 00:08:10.515\nthis is a pretty serious one, this is\na very high level problem that it's found.\n\n138\n00:08:10.515 --> 00:08:14.060\n>> That's a great feature, when you look\nat it, it looks like I think it has 600\n\n139\n00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.410\nsome odd overall vulnerabilities so\nfar, the scan isn't finished.\n\n140\n00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.360\nThat's a lot.\nThat's an overwhelming number.\n\n141\n00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.940\nIt's like, where do we even start?\n\n142\n00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.480\nBecause it's categorized and\nI know I can start at those highs.\n\n143\n00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.140\nThose are the ones I've really gotta look\nat now, and I can kinda work my way down.\n\n144\n00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.170\n>> Yeah,\nthat would be exactly what you'd wanna do\n\n145\n00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:36.510\nis to see if any of these things\nare of any concern to you.\n\n146\n00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:40.190\nIf there's something that you\ncan just kind of just say okay,\n\n147\n00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.580\nthere's no big deal here or whatever.\n\n148\n00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.650\nJust because it says it's\na high level problem and\n\n149\n00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.750\na nasty problem doesn't mean that you\nshould sit here and freak out and\n\n150\n00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:54.810\nsay well, hey, wait a minute,\nI've got something nasty going on here.\n\n151\n00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:59.190\n>> You might have mitigated those risks in\nother ways in this vulnerability detector\n\n152\n00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.040\ndoesn't see that.\n\n153\n00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.680\nSo it sees it as a vulnerability, and\nyou're like okay, well I've already taken\n\n154\n00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.070\ncare of that somewhere else, so\nI don't have to worry about it.\n\n155\n00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.680\n>> And remember, everybody's risk\nprofile is a little different.\n\n156\n00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.820\nSo what's true for one company isn't\ngoing to be true for another one.\n\n157\n00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.660\nThis one's just saying it doesn't know\nwhat your company is, what your deal is,\n\n158\n00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.090\nit's just saying, I found problems.\n\n159\n00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:25.200\nAnd with these problems I found, it's\nup for you to take a look at and decide\n\n160\n00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:31.420\nis this something of concern or is this\nsomething that you just want to let go?\n\n161\n00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.750\nSo I just go ahead and\nbrowse through these things.\n\n162\n00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.680\nAnd it's actually interesting\nwhen you go through it,\n\n163\n00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.310\nthe types of stuff that\nit really finds in here.\n\n164\n00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.950\nI found some of these\nthings I've gone through.\n\n165\n00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.100\nLook at this.\n\n166\n00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.460\nCredit card data detected.\n\n167\n00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:55.900\nAlright I'm going to be off screen for\na minute here testing these out.\n\n168\n00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:01.470\n[LAUGH] But you know it's saying here I\nmean take a look down here, by the way,\n\n169\n00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.070\nthis is why you've gotta double check\nthings I mean if you saw that and\n\n170\n00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:08.380\nsays woah, credit card numbers detected\nand you're like flipping out in here.\n\n171\n00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.552\nTake a look at what\nit's saying right here.\n\n172\n00:10:11.552 --> 00:10:15.610\nIt's saying if you can't read that,\nit's saying Vega has detected\n\n173\n00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:19.270\na string of digits that have similar\ncharacteristics to credit card numbers.\n\n174\n00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:23.640\nIt's saying you should review it to\nsee if that's actually the case.\n\n175\n00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.980\n>> It might be the same number\nof digits as a Visa card and\n\n176\n00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.930\nit doesn't know the difference, or\nit finds three digits dash two digits\n\n177\n00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.770\ndash four digits and\nthat matches our Social Security format.\n\n178\n00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:34.950\nHere in the US.\n\n179\n00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.275\nAnd it doesn't know if it's a social\nsecurity number or not, right?\n\n180\n00:10:37.275 --> 00:10:38.070\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n181\n00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.240\nYeah.\nIt doesn't know that it's just telling you\n\n182\n00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:46.530\nthat hey, I think that this could,\nthat this right here is suspect.\n\n183\n00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:50.520\nTake a look at it and see what you think\nit is, and you make the determination.\n\n184\n00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.110\nIt's not going to make\nthe determination for you.\n\n185\n00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.840\nJust going to say,\nthis is a serious issue, but exists.\n\n186\n00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.550\nWhich it is, if it does exist.\n\n187\n00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:01.840\nSo it's something that I should\nreally take a good look at to see if\n\n188\n00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.110\nthere is any problem there.\n\n189\n00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:09.750\nAnd it's the same thing\nwhen you go down this list,\n\n190\n00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:13.630\nand we close that\nSocial Security number detected.\n\n191\n00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:17.540\nIt's got some things in there, and indeed\nwhen you look at it, there are some things\n\n192\n00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:22.040\nthere you can see do resemble\nsocial security numbers explicitly.\n\n193\n00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:27.690\nI mean, all these, when you look at them,\nare the same number of digits, but\n\n194\n00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.650\nyou've got two in there at least that even\nhave the dash is all in the right place.\n\n195\n00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:36.770\nSo it's saying I've got some stuff\nin here that definitely fits that,\n\n196\n00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:41.870\ndefinitely matches the fingerprint that I\nknow that social security numbers have,\n\n197\n00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:45.090\nso you better look to see if this\nis something that's a concern.\n\n198\n00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:49.930\nAnd, I would, I know the location of this,\nby this scanner notes the location.\n\n199\n00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:56.600\nSo I can go and click on this,\nclick on that link, or go to that link,\n\n200\n00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:01.750\nif provided, and\nsee what it's actually squawking about.\n\n201\n00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:05.580\nThat may not be an actual social security\nnumber, that could be something else.\n\n202\n00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.380\nIt could be a resource ID,\nit could be something.\n\n203\n00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.550\nIt could actually be there actually are\nsequences of social security numbers that\n\n204\n00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.610\nare used specifically for testing.\n\n205\n00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:19.540\nAnd so, you could find those ones\nonline all over the place if you\n\n206\n00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.560\nknow what you're looking for,\nthey're in a lot of places.\n\n207\n00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.100\nAnd they use them for application testing,\nthey use them for advertisements and\n\n208\n00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.430\nstuff like that.\n\n209\n00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:32.260\nSo it's just like what's that number\nthey have, it's an area code they\n\n210\n00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:37.128\nhave in all the movies or something.\n\n211\n00:12:37.128 --> 00:12:37.923\n>> Yeah.\n\n212\n00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:42.400\n>> [LAUGH] It used to not go to anything,\nso\n\n213\n00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.840\nit's calling you out saying yeah,\nthere's a concern here.\n\n214\n00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.720\nSame thing.\n\n215\n00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.370\nYou keep going down the slowest,\njust take a look.\n\n216\n00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:55.650\nThis is one of the few scanners I\nsee out here that actually does\n\n217\n00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:59.830\ngo to extra lengths to flag that\nhave found something of that nature.\n\n218\n00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.820\nSocial security information,\ncredit card information.\n\n219\n00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.940\nOther ones will find them, but\nthis one just really comes out and\n\n220\n00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.311\njust take a look at this.\n\n221\n00:13:07.311 --> 00:13:08.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It's really quick.\n\n222\n00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.670\nIt's really obvious about doing this.\n\n223\n00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.750\nAnd then you can see other things.\n\n224\n00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.670\nIt's finds source code disclosures,\n\n225\n00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:20.160\nI've found 187 of these things that\ncould be possible source code.\n\n226\n00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.280\nSo maybe you wanna look to see if that's\nsomething that's a concern to you,\n\n227\n00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:28.040\ncuz a source code could lead to\nthings like sequel injections.\n\n228\n00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.460\nIt could lead to be that people\nare manipulating your site or\n\n229\n00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.090\ndoing anything nasty to it.\n\n230\n00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:36.680\nSo that's something to, again,\nthat you would want to really kind of\n\n231\n00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.780\nlook through and see if there's any\nconcern here, and I keep going on and\n\n232\n00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.630\non and on I won't keep going on and\non and on through here.\n\n233\n00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.050\nI was kinda scanning through this myself.\n\n234\n00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:54.135\nAnd you can see, I don't need keep you\nhere and go through 919 possible problems.\n\n235\n00:13:54.135 --> 00:13:55.720\n>> [LAUGH] And counting.\n\n236\n00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.320\n>> Yeah, it's still going.\n\n237\n00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.560\n>> But now, this is something\nthat we would look at, and\n\n238\n00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.500\nwe would do our risk management deal with\nthis, and probably run the scan again.\n\n239\n00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.930\nTo see how we did, if we remove those.\n\n240\n00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.270\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n241\n00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:13.650\nYou take another glance at to see\nif there's a problem with this.\n\n242\n00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:17.410\nStill, first of all, see if it's\nsomething that needs to be addressed.\n\n243\n00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:21.290\nJust because it exists, doesn't mean it\nneeds to be addressed through action.\n\n244\n00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:26.490\nThe only thing you need to do is, hey is\nthis a problem, I took a quick look at it.\n\n245\n00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:30.920\nIt's not Social Security numbers,\netc., where there is risk there.\n\n246\n00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.190\nYeah, the format of it but\nthey're all ones that are invalid.\n\n247\n00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:39.457\n>> Turns out that's the way our\npacking slip numbers look, and so\n\n248\n00:14:39.457 --> 00:14:44.320\nwe don't [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, so it's for whatever reason.\n\n249\n00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.660\nYeah, they match the format, but the\nSocial Security numbers are either done\n\n250\n00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:54.460\nfor testing, or there's something else\nthat just happens to be in that format.\n\n251\n00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.790\nBut better safe than sorry.\n\n252\n00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.740\nIt's telling you this is\nsomething that I flagged.\n\n253\n00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:03.320\nYou wanna go take a look, but you don't\nnecessarily need to take actions.\n\n254\n00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.810\nThat would be probably one of\nthe nastiest things that people do or\n\n255\n00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:12.230\nmost time-consuming things people do\nwhen looking at doing website and\n\n256\n00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:16.320\nstuff like that and tweaking them, is that\nthey look at them and say, well I need to\n\n257\n00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.850\ntake direct action against this,\nbecause this is definitely a problem here.\n\n258\n00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:26.770\nIt's like, whoa, just because it\nsays there's a problem, doesn't\n\n259\n00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.610\nmean that you should just immediately\njust march off like a robot and fix it.\n\n260\n00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:34.560\nIt's a case of you've gotta stir some\nintelligence under that picture and say,\n\n261\n00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.730\noh, well wait a minute.\n\n262\n00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:40.460\nI need to take a little some\nextra steps here and say no.\n\n263\n00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.690\nThis isn't really a problem for me.\n\n264\n00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.230\nThat's what Vega is going to do for you.\n\n265\n00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:48.890\nShe's going to find them,\n\n266\n00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.660\nyou're going to take a look to see if\nthere's actually a real problem there.\n\n267\n00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.330\nAnd you can save these\nresults if you need to.\n\n268\n00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:55.970\n>> Well that's a great.\n\n269\n00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:58.558\nIt's a nice GUI web vulnerability scanner,\nbut\n\n270\n00:15:58.558 --> 00:16:02.673\nI know you said you've got a command line\nscanner for us to take a look at as well\n\n271\n00:16:02.673 --> 00:16:04.656\n>> Yes, there is a command line scanner.\n\n272\n00:16:04.656 --> 00:16:10.466\nThe command line scanner that\nwe have is one called Skipfish.\n\n273\n00:16:10.466 --> 00:16:15.986\nSkipfish, you can access right through\nthe menus and it brings up this command\n\n274\n00:16:15.986 --> 00:16:21.015\nline and the command line will,\nyou've got plenty of options with it.\n\n275\n00:16:21.015 --> 00:16:24.780\nYou can give it credentials, so\nit can dig in deeper into folders and\n\n276\n00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.507\nstuff like that if it needs to.\n\n277\n00:16:26.507 --> 00:16:32.145\nIf you wanna take a look at that,\nit can do rudimentary password cracking.\n\n278\n00:16:32.145 --> 00:16:36.266\nIt can do just a lot of little things, it\ncan intercept cookies and store those for\n\n279\n00:16:36.266 --> 00:16:37.666\nyou, it can deny cookies.\n\n280\n00:16:37.666 --> 00:16:40.330\nI mean, you can just so\nmany different tweaks to it.\n\n281\n00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.151\nI even see things in here\nwhen you look through it,\n\n282\n00:16:43.151 --> 00:16:46.576\nI can draw your attention to stuff like,\nit can do buzzing and\n\n283\n00:16:46.576 --> 00:16:50.631\nthings like that to test different\nrange of inputs to see what those do.\n\n284\n00:16:50.631 --> 00:16:53.904\nBut again, to save time for us so\n\n285\n00:16:53.904 --> 00:16:59.243\nwe're not sitting here\nwhile it's doing the scan,\n\n286\n00:16:59.243 --> 00:17:03.020\nI have run a couple scans for us here.\n\n287\n00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.715\nActually, I've run a scan here for us and\n\n288\n00:17:06.715 --> 00:17:11.253\nwhat the cool thing about\nthis is just to kind to give\n\n289\n00:17:11.253 --> 00:17:15.918\nyou a kind of a look here is\nwhen you run the scan word.\n\n290\n00:17:15.918 --> 00:17:21.160\nI had my command line right here.\n\n291\n00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.760\nI ran the command,\nit's chewing right on through.\n\n292\n00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.787\nTake a look, it's just, yeah.\n\n293\n00:17:24.787 --> 00:17:26.663\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n294\n00:17:26.663 --> 00:17:29.829\n>> But where's my command line.\n\n295\n00:17:29.829 --> 00:17:35.193\nAll the quick command line also run here,\nbecause that scan\n\n296\n00:17:35.193 --> 00:17:40.234\nis still running is you can\njust go ahead and like I said,\n\n297\n00:17:40.234 --> 00:17:45.169\nyou run skipfish and\nwhat I can do is I can do skipfish and\n\n298\n00:17:45.169 --> 00:17:49.673\ndo -o and then what I do is the -o says,\noutput for\n\n299\n00:17:49.673 --> 00:17:53.570\nthe report and\nwhat I will do is the output.\n\n300\n00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:58.333\nI just put a folder name in there.\n\n301\n00:17:58.333 --> 00:18:00.637\nSo, it's gonna dump it in a folder and\n\n302\n00:18:00.637 --> 00:18:04.410\nthen I will put the name\nof a target in after that.\n\n303\n00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:05.826\nAnd once I do that, hit Enter.\n\n304\n00:18:05.826 --> 00:18:09.249\nIt's gonna go through and\ndo the same type of scan that Vega did and\n\n305\n00:18:09.249 --> 00:18:13.230\nit will do that scan and it will dump\nall the results into that folder.\n\n306\n00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:18.342\nOnce I get all the stuff into that folder,\nthen if I had run the thing I could\n\n307\n00:18:18.342 --> 00:18:23.456\ngo over here and you could see since I\nran that command within this folder to\n\n308\n00:18:23.456 --> 00:18:29.585\nactually create a subfolder underneath it\nand so I've got a 909 and a 101 folder.\n\n309\n00:18:29.585 --> 00:18:34.100\nIf I open that up, it's telling me,\nhey, there's an index right there.\n\n310\n00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:37.202\nWhen you're done completing the scan,\nit says, open up the index file for\n\n311\n00:18:37.202 --> 00:18:37.802\nyour report.\n\n312\n00:18:37.802 --> 00:18:43.196\nAnd so I open it up and what will happen\nis it will actually launch the browser and\n\n313\n00:18:43.196 --> 00:18:48.440\nI can open that up and it will tell me\ndetails that are found about the scan.\n\n314\n00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:52.993\nNot as pretty, not as clean as maybe some\nof the other vulnerability scanners you've\n\n315\n00:18:52.993 --> 00:18:56.931\nseen, but it does what it's supposed\nto and gives you a good report on it.\n\n316\n00:18:56.931 --> 00:19:01.817\nThis is one for a WordPress site\nthat I set out for testing,\n\n317\n00:19:01.817 --> 00:19:04.524\nbut I've also got another one.\n\n318\n00:19:05.795 --> 00:19:08.295\nYeah, my test website's called\nChief Oriyano, deal with it.\n\n319\n00:19:08.295 --> 00:19:09.141\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n320\n00:19:09.141 --> 00:19:14.035\nthis scan's still completing, this is\nthe one you see running in the background.\n\n321\n00:19:14.035 --> 00:19:18.860\nIt's still kinda going ahead running and\nI just left that one\n\n322\n00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:23.430\ngoing while we were talking\nhere about Vega and\n\n323\n00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:27.540\nall that, just to kind of show you\nwhat the scanning process looks like.\n\n324\n00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:32.087\nThat Chief Oriyano one I had and\nI opened up my browser is just a very\n\n325\n00:19:32.087 --> 00:19:36.487\nsimple scan that you can click through and\nlook at the results.\n\n326\n00:19:36.487 --> 00:19:40.836\nThis is what the actual scan will\nlook like as it's going through and\n\n327\n00:19:40.836 --> 00:19:42.220\ndoing it's job.\n\n328\n00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:47.011\nYou can see no GUI, none of those\nprogress bars or anything moving across.\n\n329\n00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:49.560\nIt's just telling you, hey,\nthis is what I'm doing.\n\n330\n00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.414\nIt's looking,\nit's telling you where it is.\n\n331\n00:19:52.414 --> 00:19:57.350\nWhere on the website it is problems it\nfound and it just keeps going through.\n\n332\n00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:02.107\nYou really don't even have to look at\nthis, you can just sit there and just tap,\n\n333\n00:20:02.107 --> 00:20:03.320\ntap, tap, Enter.\n\n334\n00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.300\nGo get lunch or whatever,\nlet it do its job.\n\n335\n00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.283\nWhen it comes back,\njust go into that folder,\n\n336\n00:20:10.283 --> 00:20:14.640\nopen that index file and start browsing\naway and see what it finds and\n\n337\n00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:19.320\nit will give you pretty clear descriptions\nof things just like Vega did.\n\n338\n00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:24.096\nThe one that I happen to\nchoose here by scanning\n\n339\n00:20:24.096 --> 00:20:28.631\nthis website, my own website, open it up.\n\n340\n00:20:28.631 --> 00:20:32.987\nIt just tells me when I click on it,\nit gives me samples of code and\n\n341\n00:20:32.987 --> 00:20:36.620\nthings that it actually\nfound as being problems.\n\n342\n00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:41.489\nThis one didn't find any serious\nproblems with this website, so\n\n343\n00:20:41.489 --> 00:20:46.635\nas you can see, there's nothing\nflagged in here as being a problem.\n\n344\n00:20:46.635 --> 00:20:48.359\nThat's because I'm a professional dude,\ncome on.\n\n345\n00:20:48.359 --> 00:20:52.176\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don't expect any less of you at\n\n346\n00:20:52.176 --> 00:20:53.297\nchieforiyano.com.\n\n347\n00:20:53.297 --> 00:20:58.111\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So but you can see it go,\n\n348\n00:20:58.111 --> 00:21:02.215\nit gives you data about this one.\n\n349\n00:21:02.215 --> 00:21:04.834\nIt doesn't really have much to talk about.\n\n350\n00:21:04.834 --> 00:21:09.688\nThe other one when it completes will\nactually go through and puke out a bunch\n\n351\n00:21:09.688 --> 00:21:15.627\nof stuff to that folder and bang and start\ngoing through and browsing that HTML file.\n\n352\n00:21:15.627 --> 00:21:20.203\nWhat I like about this one is the fact\nthat it does generate that HTML file\n\n353\n00:21:20.203 --> 00:21:24.781\nreally quickly and easily and you can\nclick through it in any browser and\n\n354\n00:21:24.781 --> 00:21:28.849\nthen that's a very easy thing for\nyou to just put into a report.\n\n355\n00:21:28.849 --> 00:21:31.917\nYou're making that pin testing report,\noh, hey, here you go.\n\n356\n00:21:31.917 --> 00:21:35.445\nJust slip that right in as one of the\nattachments to my pin testing report and\n\n357\n00:21:35.445 --> 00:21:39.200\nI'm done, you're definitely going to\nhave to do a little more analysis of it.\n\n358\n00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.132\nBut the point of the matter\nis you have that report.\n\n359\n00:21:42.132 --> 00:21:45.295\nIf someone wants a report\nthat they can click through,\n\n360\n00:21:45.295 --> 00:21:49.696\nit's a report that they can click through,\nreally quickly and easily, but\n\n361\n00:21:49.696 --> 00:21:54.110\nit gives you the same type of information\nalbeit in a different format.\n\n362\n00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:58.938\nIt gives you the same type of\ninformation something like Vega would or\n\n363\n00:21:58.938 --> 00:22:02.611\nany of the other web\nvulnerability scanners would.\n\n364\n00:22:02.611 --> 00:22:08.236\nI just happen to find I like Skipfish,\nbecause it's so simplistic.\n\n365\n00:22:08.236 --> 00:22:14.823\nI mean, all you need to do is just\nlet the thing just go ahead and\n\n366\n00:22:14.823 --> 00:22:20.220\nrun and I'm just [SOUND] go ahead and\ndo whatever.\n\n367\n00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:24.351\nI could actually open up another Skipfish\nsession against something else and\n\n368\n00:22:24.351 --> 00:22:26.163\nlet that go ahead and run.\n\n369\n00:22:26.163 --> 00:22:28.820\n>> Command line,\nit's scriptable, I'm sure.\n\n370\n00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:30.932\n>> Yeah, you could script it, absolutely.\n\n371\n00:22:30.932 --> 00:22:35.255\nSo that's such a just neat thing to\nbe able to have and since it's so\n\n372\n00:22:35.255 --> 00:22:40.140\nlightweight, anything that's got that\nGUI is gonna have more overhead.\n\n373\n00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:44.077\nThis one's so lightweight and\ncan do its job very quickly.\n\n374\n00:22:44.077 --> 00:22:48.590\nAnd the guy, actually that does this\nupdates the database all the time.\n\n375\n00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:51.225\nSo, it's a command line tool\nthat he updates the database and\n\n376\n00:22:51.225 --> 00:22:52.702\nhe actually has an email address.\n\n377\n00:22:52.702 --> 00:22:55.437\nYou can contact him,\nif you have problems with it and or\n\n378\n00:22:55.437 --> 00:22:58.040\nit's not picking up something or whatever.\n\n379\n00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:02.789\nAnd he'll respond back to you and you,\noh, well, let me incorporate that or\n\n380\n00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:05.286\nlet me tweak this or have you tried this?\n\n381\n00:23:05.286 --> 00:23:07.430\nSo he's right.\n\n382\n00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.095\nThe developer, this is right there.\n\n383\n00:23:09.095 --> 00:23:09.797\n>> Fantastic.\n\n384\n00:23:09.797 --> 00:23:11.939\n>> Yeah, so really, really great tool.\n\n385\n00:23:11.939 --> 00:23:15.901\nSo that just kind of,\nthese aren't the only two, but\n\n386\n00:23:15.901 --> 00:23:19.952\nwe're showing you Vega,\nall the GUI side of things and\n\n387\n00:23:19.952 --> 00:23:26.070\nthen Skipfish using a command line, so\nyou can choose which way you want to go.\n\n388\n00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:29.740\nThey both will get you there, it's just\na question of which one's your preference?\n\n389\n00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:30.960\n>> Very good, Sean.\n\n390\n00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.450\nWell, a lot of great information on\na couple of the web vulnerability scanners\n\n391\n00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:40.429\nthat we've got available in our arsenal\nunder Kali 2.0, we got Skipfish and Vega.\n\n392\n00:23:40.429 --> 00:23:43.820\nBut looking at the clock, it's about\ntime for us to wrap this one up.\n\n393\n00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.210\nAny parting thoughts for us, Sean?\n\n394\n00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:50.092\n>> Not really, I think you got a good\nlook at the reports and the way this\n\n395\n00:23:50.092 --> 00:23:54.270\nthings work and it's up to you to go\nthrough and try it out now, I guess.\n\n396\n00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:57.657\n>> Get out there and play and\nremember, when you have permission.\n\n397\n00:23:57.657 --> 00:24:01.302\nWell, ladies and gentlemen, we hope you\nenjoyed watching this one signing off for\n\n398\n00:24:01.302 --> 00:24:02.670\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n399\n00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:03.779\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n400\n00:24:03.779 --> 00:24:04.931\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n401\n00:24:04.931 -->

00:00:15.047\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:18.861\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\nback again with Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:18.861 --> 00:00:22.350\nWe're diving right back into\nthe world of Kali Linux 2.0.\n\n6\n00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.800\nAnd, well, in particular, we've got\nthe Zed Proxy lined up for today.\n\n7\n00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.400\nRight, Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.083\n>> Yup, that's what we've got.\n\n9\n00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:33.560\nI love the name of it, Zed Attack Proxy,\nor they sometimes call it ZAP.\n\n10\n00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.917\nBut, you know, what it is,\nit's actually a web vulnerability scanner,\n\n11\n00:00:37.917 --> 00:00:40.840\nor a web application scanner specifically.\n\n12\n00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.940\nBut we can use it to point at websites and\nit'll crawl the websites\n\n13\n00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.680\nto see if it finds vulnerabilities for us\nand give us information on what it finds.\n\n14\n00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:58.420\nAnd it gives us time to kind of put our\nskills to use or to call our developer or\n\n15\n00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.130\ndecide what the best course of action\nis based on the problems that it finds.\n\n16\n00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.050\nSo it's a pretty nice tool to have\nconsidering that web applications,\n\n17\n00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.990\nthey can be some of the toughest things\nand most complex things you may run into.\n\n18\n00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.950\n>> But we're really fortunate because\nmost web developers out there,\n\n19\n00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.541\nthey think security first, right?\n\n20\n00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:17.888\nI mean security's baked into\neverything they develop.\n\n21\n00:01:17.888 --> 00:01:20.926\n>> Oh absolutely.\n\n22\n00:01:20.926 --> 00:01:25.408\n>> [LAUGH] SImple things like field\nvalidation, or even limiting,\n\n23\n00:01:25.408 --> 00:01:29.690\nall sorts of, the SQL injection attacks\nyou hear, they almost all tie back to\n\n24\n00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.600\nthese web application vulnerabilities so\nit is really big problem right?\n\n25\n00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.610\n>> Yeah absolutely,\nit can turn into a huge problem for you.\n\n26\n00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.930\nThis is something that we've seen for\nyears,\n\n27\n00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.440\nwe still see going on,\nthere's just been so many of them.\n\n28\n00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.679\nWe've had vulnerabilities and\nattacks recently against what,\n\n29\n00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.186\nOffice of Personnel Management had one.\n\n30\n00:01:50.186 --> 00:01:54.460\nIn fact I had read one just a few days\nago that they were talking about over\n\n31\n00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.620\na four year period that,\ndid you see the one in USA Today?\n\n32\n00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.830\n>> Yeah it was like Department of\nTransportation or somebody like that.\n\n33\n00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.620\n>> Department of Energy, yeah.\n\n34\n00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.360\n>> Oh, Department of Energy.\n\n35\n00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.987\nYeah, that was it.\n\n36\n00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:06.470\n>> About 1,200 attacks over a 4 year\nperiod, 160 of them are successful.\n\n37\n00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.280\nSo, well that's good, right?\n\n38\n00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.905\nStatistically, it's not that high.\n\n39\n00:02:10.905 --> 00:02:11.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n40\n00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.821\nthe list just keeps going on and on.\n\n41\n00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:17.610\nI mean, you wanna reach back,\nthere's people like Target and Sony and\n\n42\n00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.750\nkeep going on and on and on.\n\n43\n00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.770\nSo obviously, this is a prime target.\n\n44\n00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.970\nYou consider the fact that a web server\nand web application, for the attackers,\n\n45\n00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.090\nis probably one of the first places that\nthey're gonna make contact with you.\n\n46\n00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.420\nIt's gonna be the place that's gonna serve\nas a good entry point to go further in.\n\n47\n00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.600\nTo either pull information off the site,\nto bust in through\n\n48\n00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.120\nthings like SQL injections down the road,\ncross site scripting could be a problem.\n\n49\n00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.700\nThere's a number of exploits,\n\n50\n00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.760\nso having tools like\nthe Zed Attack Proxy is very handy.\n\n51\n00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:00.560\nNow, just to kind of put it in context,\nthere is another tool that we've seen\n\n52\n00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.010\nin the past that kinda sorta fits in\nthe same category as Zed Attack Proxy.\n\n53\n00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.130\nIt's something called Burp Suite.\n\n54\n00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.270\nWhat Burp Suite does is something that\nacts as a proxy between your actual\n\n55\n00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.000\nbrowser and\nwhatever resource you're trying to access.\n\n56\n00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.560\nSo it filters all your requests back and\nforth through Burp Suite and\n\n57\n00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.006\nit can actually intercept those requests\nand tell you hey, this is what I found.\n\n58\n00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:29.295\nAnd you could choose to alter that\nrequest or send it out unaltered or\n\n59\n00:03:29.295 --> 00:03:30.852\ndrop it to see how things react,\n\n60\n00:03:30.852 --> 00:03:34.620\nwhich is kinda cool to be able to see\nthose headers as they move back and forth.\n\n61\n00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.850\nAs an application developer,\ntremendous value there.\n\n62\n00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.500\nNow, the cool thing about is that\nit's not the only one that does it.\n\n63\n00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.050\nAnd one of the benefits of the Burp Suite,\nhowever,\n\n64\n00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.028\nis that it runs pretty much cross\nplatform, because it's written in Java.\n\n65\n00:03:50.028 --> 00:03:54.955\nThe Zed Attack Proxy, you can get it for\nWindows, and you can get it for Linux.\n\n66\n00:03:54.955 --> 00:03:58.935\nObviously it's running Kali,\nwe're running it in Linux.\n\n67\n00:03:58.935 --> 00:04:04.015\nSo we're gonna use it to kind\nof take a look at a site or two.\n\n68\n00:04:04.015 --> 00:04:06.065\nAnything that I'm doing here that doesn't,\n\n69\n00:04:06.065 --> 00:04:08.115\nthat were not actually\npenetrating into a site.\n\n70\n00:04:08.115 --> 00:04:10.765\nJust keep that in mind, it looks like it.\n\n71\n00:04:10.765 --> 00:04:11.949\nAs far as you guys know,\n\n72\n00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.923\nI'm not penetrating anyone's\nsite without permission.\n\n73\n00:04:14.923 --> 00:04:15.747\nThey'll pick it up in a second.\n\n74\n00:04:15.747 --> 00:04:18.437\n>> As far as you guys know, I like that.\n\n75\n00:04:18.437 --> 00:04:19.020\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n76\n00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.082\n>> This is not really happening, trust us.\n\n77\n00:04:21.082 --> 00:04:24.150\n>> [LAUGH] If you're watching,\nthis is a recording.\n\n78\n00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.885\nWe edited out that part\nwhere I have permission.\n\n79\n00:04:27.885 --> 00:04:29.880\n[LAUGH] We'll edit it in post.\n\n80\n00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.620\nBut in any case,\nwhat I have up here onscreen is,\n\n81\n00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.550\nI do have this Zed Attack Proxy.\n\n82\n00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.460\nNotice that it's got\nthe acronym OWASP up there.\n\n83\n00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.600\nWait, what did you say it was?\n\n84\n00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.030\n>> Actually,\nI just looked this one up Sean, so\n\n85\n00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.410\nI can cheat a little bit, it's the Open\nWeb Application Security Project, OWASP.\n\n86\n00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.060\n>> They have other tools and\nother guides that they put out.\n\n87\n00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.210\nOne of the ones that I think about\nis something called a Paros proxy.\n\n88\n00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.910\nParos proxy has actually been around for\nages.\n\n89\n00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.420\nIt's been phased out.\n\n90\n00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.760\nYou will still see that mentioned in some\n\n91\n00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.450\ncircles where you can to do web\napplication checks and all that.\n\n92\n00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.710\nIt's something if you wanna\nuse you could use but\n\n93\n00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.150\nI advise against it because they\nbasically replaced that with this.\n\n94\n00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.180\nAnd so just so you know the kind of\nthe relationship between those ones is\n\n95\n00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.820\nParos proxy has kinda metamorphosized and\nevolved and became the Zed Attack Proxy.\n\n96\n00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.085\nIt grew up and got a cooler name.\n\n97\n00:05:34.085 --> 00:05:38.271\n[LAUGH]\n>> Sean for my own benefit,\n\n98\n00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:41.720\nI always have a hard time with the Kali\nmenus cuz there's so many tools.\n\n99\n00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.500\nWhich menu is this one nested under?\n\n100\n00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.050\n>> Oh great question.\n\n101\n00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.770\nThis is the thing,\nif you're going through this,\n\n102\n00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.890\nthis is what I really like about Kali in\nhere is that this one is right under,\n\n103\n00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.560\nthis version of Kali,\nWeb Application Analysis.\n\n104\n00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.610\nYou wanna do web applications scan,\nit's right in Web Application Analysis.\n\n105\n00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.720\nYou can see OWASP and ZAP right there.\n\n106\n00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.350\nSo they've really organized\nit pretty well in here.\n\n107\n00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.098\nIt's one of those things in intro where\nwe were talking about the difference in\n\n108\n00:06:12.098 --> 00:06:16.270\nthe interface,\nthis is a prime example of it.\n\n109\n00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.570\nRight here is how useful this would be.\n\n110\n00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.090\nDon brings up the question\nsaying yeah to show just exactly\n\n111\n00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.060\nwhere this is on the menu,\nbut you could also,\n\n112\n00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.110\nif that question hadn't been asked,\nit's a great question, but\n\n113\n00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.160\nif the question hadn't been asked and\ninstead of what's that tool again?\n\n114\n00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.810\nHe's looking at a website,\nyou probably could open it up and\n\n115\n00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.380\nfind it in a few clicks anyway.\n\n116\n00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.530\nSo that's a big plus, so\n\n117\n00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.580\nthat just shows right there just\nhow easy it is to find things.\n\n118\n00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:52.060\nBut, keep in mind, something I\nwas saying in the intro as well,\n\n119\n00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.240\nnot every tool that is in Kali is\ngonna be on one of these menus.\n\n120\n00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.950\nSo, that's the other thing.\n\n121\n00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.945\nNotice it does say Favorites up top, it's\nbasically, by implication, telling you\n\n122\n00:07:02.945 --> 00:07:07.007\nthey're not all there, these are just the\nones they think you're gonna use the most.\n\n123\n00:07:07.007 --> 00:07:10.025\nSo, great thing to remember.\n\n124\n00:07:10.025 --> 00:07:13.183\nSo it starts.\n\n125\n00:07:13.183 --> 00:07:14.650\nLet's go ahead and start up.\n\n126\n00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.860\nWhen you start this up the first time,\nI already started up for us so we're not\n\n127\n00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.880\nsitting here, kind of just like, hey,\nwhat are you guys doing for dinner later?\n\n128\n00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.245\nI went ahead and started it up for you.\n\n129\n00:07:24.245 --> 00:07:25.835\nSo you can,\n\n130\n00:07:25.835 --> 00:07:29.975\nwhen you start it up the first time, it\nmay very well ask you to do updates to it.\n\n131\n00:07:29.975 --> 00:07:31.485\nThat's possible.\n\n132\n00:07:31.485 --> 00:07:35.105\nThat's one of the things that we\ntalked about in a previous episode,\n\n133\n00:07:35.105 --> 00:07:40.810\nis if you know you're gonna be using\ncertain tools as part of your toolkit,\n\n134\n00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.030\nthen you probably want to go ahead and\nget used to starting these\n\n135\n00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.810\nthings when you first load Kali to\nget used to getting them updates and\n\n136\n00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.160\nget the latest versions and\neverything in there, okay?\n\n137\n00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.365\nSo I've already done that for\nus, we're ready to go.\n\n138\n00:07:53.365 --> 00:07:57.404\nSo the quick way to kinda go through and\n\n139\n00:07:57.404 --> 00:08:03.853\nlook at the way the ZAP Proxy\nworks Is gonna ask URL to attack.\n\n140\n00:08:03.853 --> 00:08:05.860\nSo you're gonna pop that right in there.\n\n141\n00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:11.200\nNow the way you do it is,\nI've typed in my own website.\n\n142\n00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.990\nAnd my own website,\n\n143\n00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:17.530\nthere's nothing really all that\ninteresting as far as web applications go.\n\n144\n00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.030\nAs far as me it's got lots\nof interesting stuff.\n\n145\n00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.190\nIt's got pictures of me doing\n\n146\n00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:22.490\nstuff like this and-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n147\n00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:23.390\n>> And hanging out\n\n148\n00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:24.410\nwith the President, stuff like that.\n\n149\n00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.310\nThere's a lot of people looking right now.\n\n150\n00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:30.500\nBut anyway, so\nonce you type in the URL you wanna do,\n\n151\n00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:36.920\nyou just click Attack and it's gonna\ngo ahead and start doing its deal.\n\n152\n00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.950\nAnd what you see there at the bottom is\nyou see that it's actually taking steps.\n\n153\n00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.080\nIt's running through and\nsweeping that site for me and\n\n154\n00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.320\nseeing, could it find it,\nsize of the site response time.\n\n155\n00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.050\nIt's giving me all that information so\nright on through.\n\n156\n00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.050\n>> Is this invasive?\n\n157\n00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.020\nThis isn't like just a passive scan.\n\n158\n00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:02.130\nThis is actively going in and\ntrying to perform some of these exploits?\n\n159\n00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.170\n>> It's looking to see what\nit can find at this level.\n\n160\n00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.950\nIt's looking to see what\nit can find on the surface.\n\n161\n00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:10.510\nThis wouldn't be really any different\nthan, that far removed from having\n\n162\n00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:16.230\nsomething like a Google going through\ntheir spiders and looking at a site.\n\n163\n00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.080\nIt's not that far removed from it.\n\n164\n00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.490\nExcept this has an emphasis on looking for\n\n165\n00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.150\ncertain problems that it can fingerprint,\nand say, I know what that is.\n\n166\n00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.090\n>> Okay.\nSo it hasn't actually used them,\n\n167\n00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:31.290\nit's just finding them, and then from\nthere we can use that information.\n\n168\n00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.690\n>> Yeah, and\nthat's a great question because\n\n169\n00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.860\nif I was joking around\nat the beginning and\n\n170\n00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.220\nsaying we have permission to do\nthis as far as you guys know.\n\n171\n00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:45.710\nThe reality is is that\ndoing something like this,\n\n172\n00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:50.100\nit probably would be more of\na courtesy to ask permission, but\n\n173\n00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.790\nI'm not doing anything that\nconstitutes an attack at this point.\n\n174\n00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:59.310\nI'm just going through and\nkind of just rattling doorknobs, and\n\n175\n00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.450\nthat's not really to consider\nto be any sort of attack.\n\n176\n00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:08.520\nIf I use the stuff, then that would be a\nlittle bit more on the bad side of things.\n\n177\n00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.870\nSo what I have, you know, going\nthrough here, let me see if I can take\n\n178\n00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:18.790\na look at some of this, is the alerts it\nhad, things it found or problem it found.\n\n179\n00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:19.980\nIt found four alerts.\n\n180\n00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.330\nSo if I look through things it found,\nit says it found a header.\n\n181\n00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.060\nSome header information missing.\n\n182\n00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:31.760\nSo if I scroll down, over here it\ntells me, here's what it found.\n\n183\n00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.950\nAnd I can, as a developer,\nbrowse this and say, okay,\n\n184\n00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.330\nwhat is the nature of that\nspecific big problem.\n\n185\n00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.520\nAnd I could use that to\nmake my determination.\n\n186\n00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:48.610\nIs this something that's worthwhile for\nme to fix or can I just leave it as it is?\n\n187\n00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:53.480\nNotice it puts a solution here for\nyou, and\n\n188\n00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.780\ntells you hey, this is what I found\nas being a potential fix for it.\n\n189\n00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:01.591\nAnd then it's got reference information\nwhich I think is really neat whenever they\n\n190\n00:11:01.591 --> 00:11:04.368\ndo that saying hey,\nhere's the information, here's some\n\n191\n00:11:04.368 --> 00:11:07.973\nMicrosoft information and here's some\nstuff from OWASP themselves saying.\n\n192\n00:11:07.973 --> 00:11:09.925\nThis is what we are saying about it so\n\n193\n00:11:09.925 --> 00:11:13.160\nyou are not just relying on\nthe vender at that point.\n\n194\n00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.700\nSo some really good stuff that you can\nsink your teeth into as a developer in\n\n195\n00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.290\nsaying hey,\ni've got something here that I can use.\n\n196\n00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.930\nHowever, when you are doing this,\nkeep in mind, if you're using the scanner,\n\n197\n00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:29.770\nthe one thing you wanna avoid\nis kinda that, I joke around and\n\n198\n00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.400\ncall it that Chicken Little syndrome.\n\n199\n00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.080\nOh, the sky is falling.\n\n200\n00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.960\nNo it's not.\n\n201\n00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.360\nIt depends on what you\ndo in your assessment.\n\n202\n00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.590\nAnd what you think is worth fixing and\n\n203\n00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:45.410\nwhat is something that's\njust not a big problem.\n\n204\n00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.620\nYou just look at here, and\nyou can see that we have,\n\n205\n00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:53.160\nit tells me some other problems or\nsome areas of concern things it found.\n\n206\n00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.800\nNothing on here that I'm seeing by\nthe color coding or anything tells me that\n\n207\n00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:02.370\nthere's really anything that it\nconsiders as being a big, big problem.\n\n208\n00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:06.659\nIt's saying here's some stuff\nthat I suggest you be aware of\n\n209\n00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.320\nand you choose what you\nwant to do from there.\n\n210\n00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.960\nIf it's something that it thinks\nis a little more aggressive, or\n\n211\n00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.470\nsomething that could be really\nexploited and cause you a lot of harm.\n\n212\n00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.420\nIt's gonna bring up different color flags.\n\n213\n00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.380\nIt will literally throw\nthe red flag up and\n\n214\n00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:26.920\nsay here's what I found\nas being a big problem.\n\n215\n00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.870\nSo that's really,\nreally neat on that level.\n\n216\n00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.190\nSomething else to also note on this, too.\n\n217\n00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:38.220\nThis also has the ability that you can,\nI don't have Firefox installed\n\n218\n00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:42.740\non here because I'm just using\na standard KALI installation.\n\n219\n00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.820\nYou can easily, if you have Firefox,\njust hit this plugin hack and\n\n220\n00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:51.110\nit will integrate with Firefox and\nshow you the way Firefox renders it.\n\n221\n00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:54.890\nAnd give you information more\non the browser side, too, so\n\n222\n00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:59.690\nit can give you a lot of really\nneat pictures at what's going on.\n\n223\n00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:05.910\nThis picture of my website on here,\nit's not all that interesting as far as\n\n224\n00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:09.870\nstuff goes and I just don't want to start\ngoing sweeping random sites out there.\n\n225\n00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:10.920\nI could have done that and\n\n226\n00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:16.300\nlike I said it's not really something that\nwould be illegal or causing a problem.\n\n227\n00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.990\nBut just as a courtesy I'm\nnot going out and doing that.\n\n228\n00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.930\nYou know so you can but\nyou can do quite a bit with this and\n\n229\n00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.640\nyou can even use this pretty\nmuch like Burp Suite.\n\n230\n00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.770\nIf you see up here the request and\nresponse type issue.\n\n231\n00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:33.910\nIf you remember when we did Burp Suite and\nthe ethical hacking course and\n\n232\n00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:38.680\nin the forensics course, Burps Suite\nacted as that proxy, as we were saying,\n\n233\n00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.620\nbetween the browser and\nthe resource and back and forth.\n\n234\n00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.120\nThis is actually doing the same thing.\n\n235\n00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.130\nIt's acting as that proxy back and forth.\n\n236\n00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:51.640\nSo here it went out and it says it's made,\nit's seen a request from my side.\n\n237\n00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.390\nSo it's saying go to this website and.\n\n238\n00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.334\nIt has agent information and all that.\n\n239\n00:13:56.334 --> 00:13:59.037\nAnd then you see the response back saying,\nhey you know it's,\n\n240\n00:13:59.037 --> 00:14:00.860\nhere's the information about it.\n\n241\n00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:05.830\nAnd here's the actual HTML code,\nyou know, right on down the line,\n\n242\n00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:09.870\nyou know, so you can really,\nif you want to get into it.\n\n243\n00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.505\nYou can really start, you know,\nseeing what's happening back and\n\n244\n00:14:13.505 --> 00:14:16.140\nforth between two applications,\nand track it.\n\n245\n00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.260\nSome of these things will actually\nlet you modify this stuff too, so\n\n246\n00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.440\nif you want to take a tweak as it's going\nback and forth, you can intercept it and\n\n247\n00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.620\nhold the conversation right there,\nand make a tweak, and send it out.\n\n248\n00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.650\nAnd see how it responds.\n\n249\n00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.460\nIt's kind of interesting\nto do some of that stuff,\n\n250\n00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.560\nif you're really into web\napplication development.\n\n251\n00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.350\nBut for\nright now we're not going to worry about,\n\n252\n00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:38.190\nI would just get some weird results or\nsomething like that.\n\n253\n00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:41.170\nBut that's just to kind of show you\n\n254\n00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:46.160\nthat this can do the stuff\nthat the Burp Suite does.\n\n255\n00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.808\nBut it also has some other stuff I think\nis actually easier than in a lot of cases.\n\n256\n00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:53.780\nIt has reporting tools.\n\n257\n00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.700\nWe don't really need to demo those here,\nbut\n\n258\n00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:01.260\nyou can see that you can scan a website\nand it could actually say, export all this\n\n259\n00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:06.380\nstuff out to a text file, you could\nuse that as part of the pen task.\n\n260\n00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.400\nYou've got ready made,\nI wont say evidence,\n\n261\n00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:15.340\nbut ready made data and documentation\nthat you can just saved someplace,\n\n262\n00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.050\nand say hey I looked at\nyour web application.\n\n263\n00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.260\nThis is what I found off my scan.\n\n264\n00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.590\nAnd this is what I recommend you do.\n\n265\n00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.500\nIt'll give that to you.\n\n266\n00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.290\nSo you can use that and\nincorporate into your report somehow.\n\n267\n00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.490\nThat's pretty nice to have.\n\n268\n00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:33.570\nSo it's got a bunch of imaging stuff\nthere and then as far as other\n\n269\n00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:39.060\ntools I don't have a web application\nto test that at this point in here.\n\n270\n00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:43.040\nBut I also want to point this out that\nthis is something that we mentioned in\n\n271\n00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:48.760\nthe Ethical Hacking Course, it also has\nan application fuzzer, too, built in.\n\n272\n00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.270\nAnd if you don't remember what fuzzing it,\n\n273\n00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:53.550\nnow's a good time to\ngo look at the course.\n\n274\n00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:54.225\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n275\n00:15:54.225 --> 00:15:59.129\n[LAUGH] If you don't remember what\nfuzzing is, fuzzing is where you can try\n\n276\n00:15:59.129 --> 00:16:03.889\na range of values Against an input\non an application, an input source.\n\n277\n00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:08.216\nAnd that range of values and different\ncombinations can watch to see how\n\n278\n00:16:08.216 --> 00:16:11.751\nthe application responds to\nthose different values, and\n\n279\n00:16:11.751 --> 00:16:17.280\nmaybe see if the application will crash or\nspill information that it shouldn't be.\n\n280\n00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.450\nThat's what fuzzing will do for you.\n\n281\n00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.450\nSo this thing can actually do\nit against a web application for\n\n282\n00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.720\nyou right directly in the context of this.\n\n283\n00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:30.210\nCan't do that here against a live\napplication just because anything that\n\n284\n00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.840\nwould give me anything interesting\nwould be a live site, and\n\n285\n00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.748\nI don't have permission to do\nit against any of those ones.\n\n286\n00:16:34.748 --> 00:16:35.920\nBut-\n>> But\n\n287\n00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.100\nthen this is basically the process people\nwho go through to find buffer overflows or\n\n288\n00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.040\nserver attacks that they could engage.\n\n289\n00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.390\nThrough a web interface, right?\n\n290\n00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.280\nThey don't even need to have\nshell access to assist them,\n\n291\n00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.690\nif they can find a way to crash it by\nexploit it by some web application.\n\n292\n00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:49.950\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n293\n00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:50.990\nThat's what they would do.\n\n294\n00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.850\nThey would use something like this\nto see how the system response.\n\n295\n00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:58.220\nWell if I throw in this combination of\ncharacters, or at this url, or whatever.\n\n296\n00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:02.370\nIt doesn't like that and so,\nI can use this to go in further.\n\n297\n00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:07.410\nSo heck, your fuzzing might reveal\na lack of input validation.\n\n298\n00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.520\nYou try a range of values,\nand it accepts them all, and\n\n299\n00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.400\nyou're trying some really exotic things.\n\n300\n00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.430\nIf you're putting in your name, and you're\nputting in dollar signs, stuff like that,\n\n301\n00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.720\nand it's accepting it, there's pretty\nmuch no input validation, there or\n\n302\n00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.920\nany appreciable input validation.\n\n303\n00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.880\nSo let the games begin.\n\n304\n00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:29.120\nLet's try the next step of\npenetration of which there are tools.\n\n305\n00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.100\nIf you find out that the system\nhas a database in the back end\n\n306\n00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.450\nby doing something like this, and\nyou do fuzzing, and you find out\n\n307\n00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:44.120\nwhen you do fuzzing it's accepting a\npretty wide and generous range of values.\n\n308\n00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:49.590\nWe've got tools right here in Kali,\nour database assessment tools.\n\n309\n00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.780\nWhere we can now try to run\na SQL injection against that.\n\n310\n00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:58.060\nThat would be the very next step to\nsee where we're gonna go from there.\n\n311\n00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:01.690\nSo this is one of things\nI really like about Kali.\n\n312\n00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:05.870\nI mean, heck, even the way they\nhave these menus arranged here or\n\n313\n00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:07.980\nare these favorites arranged\nin here 1 through 13?\n\n314\n00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:11.220\nThey pretty much got our\none through really ten,\n\n315\n00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.581\nthey pretty much have them set up in a way\nthat follow kinda the attack process.\n\n316\n00:18:15.581 --> 00:18:19.026\n[LAUGH] They've really arranged it so\noh, click, done with that.\n\n317\n00:18:19.026 --> 00:18:20.790\nOkay let's go to number four.\n\n318\n00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:24.440\nClick [LAUGH] and\njust start monkeying around.\n\n319\n00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.100\n>> Yeah, and\nthe web application stuff is so important.\n\n320\n00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.260\nI know I made the joke, and\nI don't normally do the security shows.\n\n321\n00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.310\nI'm standing in for Mike.\n\n322\n00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:33.760\nI normally do the server, and\nrouter, and switch shows.\n\n323\n00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.160\nAnd in those shows we always stress how\nimportant it is to keep our servers up\n\n324\n00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.100\nto date,\nkeep our operating systems up to date,\n\n325\n00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.650\nkeep our applications up to date,\nbut, web applications.\n\n326\n00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:45.450\nA lot of companies develop\ntheir web apps in house,\n\n327\n00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:49.260\nand developers don't code\nthinking security first.\n\n328\n00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.760\nOr you run other solutions like WordPress,\nright?\n\n329\n00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.750\nWordPress is one of the largest\nweb allocations in the world,\n\n330\n00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.940\nit's used all over the place, and\nexploits come out for it all the time, and\n\n331\n00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:01.270\nthey patch it, but\nmaybe we're not updating that system.\n\n332\n00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.440\nAnd so, being able to check for\nthese tests, look for what's out there.\n\n333\n00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.220\nA lot of stuff is just sitting there\nin the open if you look for it, but\n\n334\n00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.070\na lot of people don't bother to look for\nit, right.\n\n335\n00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:14.330\nRemember the developers they're almost\nalways driven for features first,\n\n336\n00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:15.940\nsecurity second.\n\n337\n00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.760\nAnd that's a problem,\nit really should be the other way around.\n\n338\n00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.930\nThat's why you see so\nmany sites getting broken into,\n\n339\n00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.570\nand that's why tools like\nthis are able to work so\n\n340\n00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:26.830\nwell, cuz they have a well established\nbase of things to search for.\n\n341\n00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:31.100\n>> Yeah, absolutely,\nthey're taking those knowledge bases and\n\n342\n00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.960\nbeing able to check for it quite rapidly.\n\n343\n00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.272\nThat's a huge thing and just to kind of,\n\n344\n00:19:36.272 --> 00:19:40.624\nnot to sound like we're selling something\nhere, you know that saying, but\n\n345\n00:19:40.624 --> 00:19:44.490\nwait there's more, right\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n346\n00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:45.940\n>> Let me just kind of point out\n\n347\n00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.550\none other thing that\ncould be used in this.\n\n348\n00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:55.080\nThis is where Burp Suite and OWASP\nkinda tend to go their different ways.\n\n349\n00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:59.260\nOne of the things I really like about\nthis, is there's this button right here in\n\n350\n00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:03.830\nOWASP where you can click on it and\ntake a look at what it has.\n\n351\n00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:08.820\nThese are all additional modules,\nthat they aren't loaded right now, but\n\n352\n00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.620\nI can just check a box and\nsay let's check of that.\n\n353\n00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.300\nThis adds an additional capabilities.\n\n354\n00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.750\nThere's stuff in here that you can check\nfor that we talked about in ethical\n\n355\n00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:24.100\nhacking, look at this one,\nthis forced browsing.\n\n356\n00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:31.300\nWhat that will refer to is that's where\nyou can see well, can you browse out\n\n357\n00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:36.710\nof the web server folder, and\non to the actual, onto the actual system.\n\n358\n00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:40.320\nI like to think of\na website as kind of being\n\n359\n00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.140\na file shut access by the http protocol.\n\n360\n00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.310\nIt's kinda crude but it works.\n\n361\n00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.826\nSo if you think of that and\nyou're browsing outside of the share,\n\n362\n00:20:47.826 --> 00:20:50.314\nthey call it a directory traversal,\nthat's what this will do.\n\n363\n00:20:50.314 --> 00:20:52.930\nIt will check to see if you're\nvulnerable directory traversal.\n\n364\n00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.830\nSo if someone hasn't done\nthe permissions or something right, or\n\n365\n00:20:55.830 --> 00:21:00.800\njust has left certain options on\nthe site configured the wrong way,\n\n366\n00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.620\nthis will actually check to see hey,\nguess what I just found.\n\n367\n00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.080\nI brute forced some stuff and\nit's a different string, and\n\n368\n00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:11.610\nI can hop right on out of that folder, and\nstart looking at the file system on that,\n\n369\n00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.870\non that web server so\nI've gotten out of that folder.\n\n370\n00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:16.780\nI'm looking at the host system,\n\n371\n00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.760\nrather than just a server\nlike I'm supposed to be.\n\n372\n00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.405\nAnd you know, that's just going in,\nthe tip of the iceberg.\n\n373\n00:21:23.405 --> 00:21:25.675\nYou can really keep going and\ngoing and going.\n\n374\n00:21:25.675 --> 00:21:27.285\nI mean,\nI like the fact it's got stuff in here.\n\n375\n00:21:27.285 --> 00:21:29.565\nIf you're really into\ndevelopment it's got stuff.\n\n376\n00:21:29.565 --> 00:21:35.990\nWe're even looking for ajax holes and\nright on down the line.\n\n377\n00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.110\nSo it's pretty powerful.\n\n378\n00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:43.050\nAnd I would even add in on top\nof this that there's people\n\n379\n00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:47.840\nthat have written their own plug-ins\nthat you can add on top of this.\n\n380\n00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:52.670\nI mean that's what this marketplace\nis for, this marketplace.\n\n381\n00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:55.538\nI mean yeah there's a lot of beta and\nother stuff like that in there.\n\n382\n00:21:55.538 --> 00:21:57.790\nThere's third-party ones out there.\n\n383\n00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.270\nYou can click and add these things on.\n\n384\n00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.120\nThese are things that people have\nfound out in the wild on their own.\n\n385\n00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.760\nI'll move that, so\nthat little alert isn't there.\n\n386\n00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.590\nThese are things that people have\nfound out in the wild, and says, hey,\n\n387\n00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.600\nthere's not a scanner for that.\n\n388\n00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.300\nSo they specifically wrote something for\nthat.\n\n389\n00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:18.740\nAnd, had it vetted and threw it in there,\nand now you can try that yourself and see.\n\n390\n00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.040\nAre you vulnerable to it?\n\n391\n00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.510\nSome of the stuff might\notherwise be difficult for\n\n392\n00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.840\nyou to find vulnerabilities on.\n\n393\n00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:28.570\nI think the stuff in here,\nthey've got stuff for checking Ruby and\n\n394\n00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:32.270\nPython in there, mean, Python, okay.\n\n395\n00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:35.330\nWe've got people that know that,\nthat's pretty.\n\n396\n00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:39.030\nIt's got some legs behind it,\nbeen around it for awhile.\n\n397\n00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:43.930\nRuby might be a little trickier to get\nsomeone that really kind of knows that.\n\n398\n00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.270\nSo you have that,\nyou even have stuff in here.\n\n399\n00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:52.270\nIf you notice, there's one here for\nSQL injections that can help you look for\n\n400\n00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:54.300\nissues revolving around that.\n\n401\n00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:59.100\nSo, you can even extend the capabilities\nof this to suggest looking for\n\n402\n00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.990\nbasic things on, if I can call it that,\nbasic things in a web application.\n\n403\n00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:08.940\nYou add this add-ons and extend it out\neven beyond just the core things that,\n\n404\n00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.150\neven something like Burp Suite,\nor whatever, or even ZAP does.\n\n405\n00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:14.920\nYou can extend it out and\nlook for a whole bunch of things.\n\n406\n00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.450\nAnd you really gotta like that,\n\n407\n00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:22.150\nbecause some of the other vulnerability\nscanners will not go this far for you.\n\n408\n00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.070\nI want to say Nessus and\nOpenVas you look at those two,\n\n409\n00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:29.840\nand nexpose is another one,\nthat you can add in plugins to it.\n\n410\n00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:33.210\nBut those plug ins usually come from\nthe vendor, or you got to go through and\n\n411\n00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:35.370\ncreate them and add them yourself.\n\n412\n00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:37.270\nThis one's got a pretty robust community.\n\n413\n00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:38.210\nIt's open source.\n\n414\n00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:41.410\nThey're not trying to make money or\nanything off of it.\n\n415\n00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:43.650\nPeople write the things and\nadd them in and\n\n416\n00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:49.260\nnow you've got an extensible very\ndiverse and checked out framework.\n\n417\n00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.719\n>> Now Sean, it says marketplace.\n\n418\n00:23:50.719 --> 00:23:52.982\nAre they all free add-ons,\nor are some of them pay?\n\n419\n00:23:52.982 --> 00:23:57.696\n>> As far as I know, everything in here,\nthese are all pretty much Free.\n\n420\n00:23:57.696 --> 00:24:03.070\nI don't think anything here's flagged as\nbeing that you actually have to pay for.\n\n421\n00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:03.980\nBut who knows?\n\n422\n00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:07.800\nThat could actually change if\nyou look at the more info.\n\n423\n00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.728\n>> I thought it said marketplace, but\nI didn't see any buy buttons or anything.\n\n424\n00:24:11.728 --> 00:24:13.470\nSo [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n425\n00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:13.970\n>> Yeah.\n\n426\n00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:20.610\nit looks like this one we hit the more\ninfo, it doesn't have anything on it that\n\n427\n00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:26.990\nsays I didn't see any dollar signs or any\npurchase or anything like that in there.\n\n428\n00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:29.528\n>> Maybe that's future functionality\nthey haven't released yet.\n\n429\n00:24:29.528 --> 00:24:31.730\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, they're going to charge it for\n\n430\n00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:33.459\nyou in the future so just look for that.\n\n431\n00:24:33.459 --> 00:24:38.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, but in any case, you can see.\n\n432\n00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:43.950\nThat you have something in\nhere that you can really\n\n433\n00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:46.570\nleverage a lot of power with this.\n\n434\n00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:49.240\nAnd so you really gotta love that.\n\n435\n00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:54.140\nThe fact that this can look at stuff other\nthan just what the other vulnerability\n\n436\n00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.690\nscanners look at is just\nimmensely powerful to you.\n\n437\n00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:03.210\nAnd even if you know you\nknow how to look at web\n\n438\n00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:07.350\napplications and you're a web developer,\nthis is only going to help you out.\n\n439\n00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:09.100\nIt's always good to have\na second set of eyeballs,\n\n440\n00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.700\neven if those eyeballs\nare a collection of bits and bytes.\n\n441\n00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.130\n>> Yep, absolutely.\n\n442\n00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:16.660\nAll right well Sean,\n\n443\n00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:21.780\ndo we got a pretty good look here\nat the zaproxy or zed attack proxy.\n\n444\n00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:24.430\nWe saw how to get into things and\nhow to use it,\n\n445\n00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:27.170\nhow to grab some information there to\nsee what's going on with out site.\n\n446\n00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:28.920\nAnd we got to see a little\nbit about the extensions and\n\n447\n00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.110\nadd ons that it's got inside of it.\n\n448\n00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:34.750\nIt's a pretty good run down of the tool,\ndo you have anything else you wanna ad?\n\n449\n00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.290\n>> Not anything specifically to add,\nbut just to mention.\n\n450\n00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:39.140\nI noticed that we got, in the chat room,\n\n451\n00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:42.210\nsomeone saying all the add-ins\nwere either beta or alpha.\n\n452\n00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:44.390\nWell, actually,\nthe top three in there are released.\n\n453\n00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:47.570\nBut I know what you're saying about\nthem being either beta or alpha.\n\n454\n00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:51.820\nBut, heck, I just think of how\ninfamous Google was for a long time.\n\n455\n00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:55.160\nIsn't Gmail technically still in beta,\nthey just erased it?\n\n456\n00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.025\nYeah, it's been released, so.\n\n457\n00:25:58.025 --> 00:26:02.520\n>> At the time we're filming this,\nKALI 2.0's not very old, right?\n\n458\n00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.760\nIt's only been out for a month or two?\n\n459\n00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.930\n>> Just about a month.\n\n460\n00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:09.340\nIt came out August 11th.\n\n461\n00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.598\n>> So, the plugin authors\nare probably still updating and\n\n462\n00:26:11.598 --> 00:26:14.442\ntrying to square things away there,\nso a number of things can change.\n\n463\n00:26:14.442 --> 00:26:17.330\nIn the security world, I think everything\nis alway beta anyway, so [LAUGH].\n\n464\n00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:19.034\n>> Yeah, pretty much.\n\n465\n00:26:19.034 --> 00:26:23.111\nI wouldn't necessarily\nlook at it's alpha or\n\n466\n00:26:23.111 --> 00:26:27.290\nits beta as being necessarily a bad thing.\n\n467\n00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.210\nIt's just you've been\ntold that's alpha and\n\n468\n00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:34.240\nbeta just double check things\nwhich you should be doing anyway.\n\n469\n00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.030\nSo that's kind of the way I look at it.\n\n470\n00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.930\n>> Yep and\nI'm sure there's some great paid tools out\n\n471\n00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:43.265\nthere that cost tens of thousands\nof dollars which are out of beta.\n\n472\n00:26:43.265 --> 00:26:44.970\n[LAUGH] But we pick our battles.\n\n473\n00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:45.590\nAll right.\nWell,\n\n474\n00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:47.140\nShawn that was a great\nrun down on the tool.\n\n475\n00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.200\nThanks for being on the show.\n\n476\n00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.980\nI hope you guys enjoyed\nit out there in tv land.\n\n477\n00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:54.760\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Don Prezet and I'm Shawn Ariano.\n\n478\n00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.660\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n",

00:00:14.410\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.140\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.810\nSean, in this episode we're going to\nbe taking a look at another scanner and\n\n6\n00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.230\nI'm not even going to try\nto same the name now.\n\n7\n00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.125\n[LAUGH] Inguma, right, Inguma.\n\n8\n00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:28.168\n>> [LAUGH] That wasn't so\ndifficult was it?\n\n9\n00:00:28.168 --> 00:00:29.160\n[LAUGH]\n>> No, not too bad.\n\n10\n00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.450\nThis is a new one on me, what is Inguma,\nwhat does it do and what are we scanning?\n\n11\n00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.280\n>> Inguma is actually one of these\ntools that fits under the category of\n\n12\n00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.230\nExploitation tools.\n\n13\n00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.510\nSo we've got\na scanner/exploitation tool now so\n\n14\n00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.540\nthe stuff we looked at in previous\nepisodes that was just stuff that could\n\n15\n00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.270\ntell us if there were vulnerabilities\nthere and issues there.\n\n16\n00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.900\nThis is gonna be able to do that, but then\nthis is also gonna be able to introduce\n\n17\n00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:03.200\nan extra element of finding problems\nthat are actually present in a specific,\n\n18\n00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.250\nor not just problems that are present,\nbut also how to exploit those problems.\n\n19\n00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.580\nYou're gonna find that in many ways,\n\n20\n00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.090\nthat this is in the same\ncategory as Metasploit is.\n\n21\n00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.210\nIt's just not at that level but\nit's kind of in the same zip code,\n\n22\n00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.780\nwhich is really quite cool\nwhen you get down to it.\n\n23\n00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.190\nSo, it's got, the funny name, I know but\nit's, don't underestimate it,\n\n24\n00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.470\nactually is a pretty powerful tool\nas far as Exploitation tools, and\n\n25\n00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.990\ntools we have in Kali goes.\n\n26\n00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.009\nAnd this is something that's\nshown up in Kali 2.0.\n\n27\n00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.520\nIt wasn't in the first version of it, but\n\n28\n00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.450\nit's something that it's\na very nice surprise, or\n\n29\n00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.330\nI shouldn't say surprise, but a very nice\ntool that we have in there to help us out.\n\n30\n00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.140\nWe'll go ahead and take a look at this.\n\n31\n00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.470\nJust in case you're wondering\nwhere they get the name from.\n\n32\n00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.778\nInguma is the Basque god of dreams,\nso if you don't know where\n\n33\n00:02:04.778 --> 00:02:10.300\nthe Basque people are,\ntell one of them that they're Spanish.\n\n34\n00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.606\nThey'll tell you where it is real quick.\n\n35\n00:02:11.606 --> 00:02:12.106\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Kidding.\n\n36\n00:02:12.106 --> 00:02:17.289\n[LAUGH] I can say that because I'm part\n\n37\n00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:22.900\nBasque, so you can't do that.\n[LAUGH] Anyway,\n\n38\n00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.370\nwhat I've got here, as I've popped it up\non my screen, as I've popped up Inguma,\n\n39\n00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.270\nInguma if you want to find\nit under applications it is\n\n40\n00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.420\nunder our exploitation tools so\nyou can see Inguma there.\n\n41\n00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.550\nWe're starting the bottom one\nof these two Inguma right there.\n\n42\n00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.300\nSo what I've done is I've opened up,\nit is a command line tool, and so\n\n43\n00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.880\nwhat I am going to do is just to kind of\ngive you a quick look I'll type in help,\n\n44\n00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.150\njust to show you what is present.\n\n45\n00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.600\nLet me kind of see if I can\nexpand this out for you a bit so\n\n46\n00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.890\nyou can kind of get the full\npicture of what is going on here.\n\n47\n00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.590\nYou can see that, it's,\nwhen you look at that second block there,\n\n48\n00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.140\nyou can see it's got discover modules,\ngather modules, you know, fuzzing and\n\n49\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.590\nexploits and stuff like that.\n\n50\n00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.850\nTerminology we've seen with Metasploit.\n\n51\n00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.650\nSo that's kind of a neat\nthing that we have there,\n\n52\n00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.690\nthat it has some similarities there.\n\n53\n00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.550\nIn fact, if you do show this discover,\ntake a look at it.\n\n54\n00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.410\nIf you do show discover,\nwhat does it have?\n\n55\n00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.050\nWell, it's got a whole list of tools.\n\n56\n00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.990\nThere's Netcraft right there.\n\n57\n00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.070\nGeoip, who is, just a list of things that\n\n58\n00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.130\nyou can use to kind of\ngive you a picture of\n\n59\n00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.840\nwhat's going on with a specific target,\nso you gotta like that.\n\n60\n00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.960\nThe thing this does,\nis that you can choose to,\n\n61\n00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.935\nyou know run these modules in any order.\n\n62\n00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:05.640\nI've got, if I can do a show, gather there\nis some other tools we have in there.\n\n63\n00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.260\nThere is Nmap making\nus another appearance.\n\n64\n00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.483\nI told you that stuff is like, nevermind.\n\n65\n00:04:14.483 --> 00:04:20.371\n[LAUGH] You know so\nit is basically a script that combines\n\n66\n00:04:20.371 --> 00:04:26.298\na whole bunch of tools for\ndoing really you name it.\n\n67\n00:04:26.298 --> 00:04:30.810\nNow, one of the easiest ways to run this,\nand you can see there\n\n68\n00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.650\nare actually are some tools in there,\nby the way, also there's unicorn scan and\n\n69\n00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.600\na couple other ones that\nare kinda popping up, Nikto, POF.\n\n70\n00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.950\nSo pretty neat range capabilities here.\n\n71\n00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.760\nBut if I type in just help again,\n\n72\n00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.300\nyou can see it's got exploits you\ncan drop off and stuff like that.\n\n73\n00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.400\nBut if you want to just really\nmake it easy on yourself and\n\n74\n00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:03.220\ngain some information about a target,\nyou can do this auto scan.\n\n75\n00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.170\nThis auto scan,\nif you type in an IP address.\n\n76\n00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.609\nI'll just go ahead and type one in here.\n\n77\n00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.670\nYou can tell the basic stuff it will do,\n\n78\n00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.450\nit'll already brute force stuff\nI'm not gonna brute force it and\n\n79\n00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.120\ntake time with that,\nit can do fuzzing by default with this.\n\n80\n00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.110\nAnd then you can have it put it out to\na report if you want, I just go ahead and\n\n81\n00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.200\nhit enter and\nthis shouldn't take too long to do,\n\n82\n00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.400\nit's to do it's dirty work but\nit's going to go through and\n\n83\n00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.590\ntake kind of a look at\nthis system I'm targeting.\n\n84\n00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.210\nSo it is telling us it's\na Windows 10 system.\n\n85\n00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.640\nIt is telling us some other stuff.\n\n86\n00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.700\nThere's a Mac address on there,\nso very quickly retrieve that.\n\n87\n00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.886\nHere's some Net BIOS stuff that\nit's pulling up right away.\n\n88\n00:05:54.886 --> 00:06:00.140\nAnd then there's some other info that\nit's able to give us information on.\n\n89\n00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.474\nThere's a port scan,\n\n90\n00:06:01.474 --> 00:06:06.322\nthere's, it think it's net screen I\ndon't know where it's getting that from.\n\n91\n00:06:06.322 --> 00:06:08.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, [LAUGH].\n\n92\n00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.330\n>> That could be cuz it's virtualized,\nit's Windows 10 in a virtual, maybe,\n\n93\n00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.690\nmaybe it's picking up some of that.\n\n94\n00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.020\n>> Fair enough,\nthat could be a completely valid reason.\n\n95\n00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.240\nA completely valid reason why it's doing\nthat, but you can see it's very quickly\n\n96\n00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:33.730\ngenerated this report against our target.\n\n97\n00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.580\nYou can if you want, like I said, you can\ntell it to do a brute force against it.\n\n98\n00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.400\nA brute force is gonna really bump up the\ntime on this, and that's why it's saying,\n\n99\n00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.460\nwell, if you wanna run that, by the way,\n\n100\n00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.950\nthere are some additional\nthings you can do here.\n\n101\n00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.960\nBut we're not gonna go ahead and\ntake time doing that.\n\n102\n00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.050\nWe know what brute forcing is.\n\n103\n00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:00.640\nThere's not really any big secret\nto run something like that.\n\n104\n00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.565\n>> Not to mention I might be embarrassed\nwhen it brute forces my password in about\n\n105\n00:07:03.565 --> 00:07:04.105\nten minutes.\n\n106\n00:07:04.105 --> 00:07:05.457\n>> Oh, you can just tell us, make it easy.\n\n107\n00:07:05.457 --> 00:07:10.662\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, so it's very quickly and\n\n108\n00:07:10.662 --> 00:07:18.490\neasily told us stuff about,\nyou know, about this target.\n\n109\n00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.490\nIt's actually kind of neat that\nwhen it goes through and does this,\n\n110\n00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.260\nbut it's identifying it as a Windows 10.\n\n111\n00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.290\nIt was able to retrieve that information.\n\n112\n00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:30.257\nThere actually are some systems.\n\n113\n00:07:30.257 --> 00:07:34.629\nThis ones pretty much just pulling that\nright off service information on that\n\n114\n00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:38.865\nsystem, that's how it's able to get that,\nthere are some that will try to\n\n115\n00:07:38.865 --> 00:07:43.169\nfingerprint a system by doing the OS\nfingerprinting and why that does work in\n\n116\n00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:47.605\na good number of cases, if the tool isn't\nup to date, so it's not new enough or\n\n117\n00:07:47.605 --> 00:07:52.044\nthe database isn't new enough, it will\ntry to get, it'll get pretty close,\n\n118\n00:07:52.044 --> 00:07:57.085\nit'll say, on a Windows 10 system it might\nsay oh, I think this is Windows 7, because\n\n119\n00:07:57.085 --> 00:08:01.859\nthat's the closest guess it can make with\nwhat it has on file And that could, that's\n\n120\n00:08:01.859 --> 00:08:06.490\ngoing to be where you're gonna need to do\nextra homework to see what's going on.\n\n121\n00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.830\nIf they have NetBios running,\nthen heck go ahead and\n\n122\n00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:13.775\nuse a tool like this to extract\nthat information and see if that's,\n\n123\n00:08:13.775 --> 00:08:18.135\nsee if it tells you the same thing or\ntells you something else.\n\n124\n00:08:18.135 --> 00:08:20.470\nIf it doesn't match up,\nthen you've really gotta-\n\n125\n00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.235\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n126\n00:08:21.235 --> 00:08:23.942\n>> All right, I've gotta get a drink and\n\n127\n00:08:23.942 --> 00:08:25.215\nfigure this out.\n\n128\n00:08:25.215 --> 00:08:29.635\nSo you can get a good amount\nof information out of it.\n\n129\n00:08:29.635 --> 00:08:33.809\nSo this just happens to be\npretty good stuff for us,\n\n130\n00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:37.800\ntelling us that it's Windows 10 in here,\nso.\n\n131\n00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.540\nSo if you want to,\nthis can actually be spit out to a report.\n\n132\n00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.380\nI didn't choose to do that because\nwe have a report on screen.\n\n133\n00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.130\nIf I wanted to put it to a file for\nlater use, fine.\n\n134\n00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.000\nThat's what I've used\nthe report function for.\n\n135\n00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.710\nRight now I've got it on screen, and\n\n136\n00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.250\nI just browse through it\nreally quickly with you.\n\n137\n00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:59.130\nSo there's no need to dump it out\nto a text file and say hey look,\n\n138\n00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.970\nlet's see what we got.\n\n139\n00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:05.830\nThose files are viewable in a browser\njust in case you wanna do that.\n\n140\n00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:10.000\nSo, that's a pretty good thing in here,\nto be able to do.\n\n141\n00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.610\nIt does have some other neat features and\n\n142\n00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:19.560\nlike I said I'll bring up the help on here\njust to kind of as I'm going through this.\n\n143\n00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.460\nYou can see it does have\nan auto-exploit module.\n\n144\n00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.950\nSo if you wanna kinda step this up,\n\n145\n00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.900\nit will actually run\na script in the background.\n\n146\n00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.670\nAnd based on the target you've selected,\nit'll say oh, well you know,\n\n147\n00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.710\nall tried to see if I can use,\n\n148\n00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:39.120\nif I have an exploit on file that I\ncan use against that specific target.\n\n149\n00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.940\nThat's pretty neat to be able to do.\n\n150\n00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:46.960\nThat's kind of like, if you guys\nremember when we did Metasploit.\n\n151\n00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.655\nMetasploit had the ability to,\nnot Metasploit, but\n\n152\n00:09:50.655 --> 00:09:55.100\non top of Metasploit,\nwhen we went through Armitage, rather.\n\n153\n00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.052\nArmitage had the ability to,\nto scan a target and\n\n154\n00:09:58.052 --> 00:10:02.084\nsee the exploits that apply to it\nif you didn't know on your own, or\n\n155\n00:10:02.084 --> 00:10:06.548\nyou could just go through and go real\ncrazy and do that hail mary on there and\n\n156\n00:10:06.548 --> 00:10:10.800\nit would just fire everything it could\nat it and see what would happen.\n\n157\n00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.505\nIt had quite a bit of options available\nthere which was pretty neat to be\n\n158\n00:10:15.505 --> 00:10:16.920\nable to do that.\n\n159\n00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.460\nThis can do some of the same thing, but\nit can't do it to the same level that\n\n160\n00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:28.560\nMetasploit can and it definitely can't\ndo it with the ease that Armitage can.\n\n161\n00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.620\nBut Armitage is in another\ncategory on its own.\n\n162\n00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:39.290\nYou know, so, other things I\nkind of like about this product\n\n163\n00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:44.410\nin here is that you can see that\nright up top, the knowledge base.\n\n164\n00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.940\nIt's got a, you can actually tell,\n\n165\n00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.560\nyou can have it load a newer\nknowledge bases in there.\n\n166\n00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.900\nAnd the knowledge bases will be\nthe same thing in that uses to,\n\n167\n00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.270\nthat the older vulnerability scanner use.\n\n168\n00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:58.390\nBut in this case, it's using it to help\nyou find those vulnerabilities and\n\n169\n00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.040\nfind exploits against them.\n\n170\n00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:04.420\nAnd so you can constantly\nbe loading those things up,\n\n171\n00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:10.760\nloading new modules on it to have it look\nfor additional features in there as well.\n\n172\n00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.910\nSo I find this a pretty robust\n\n173\n00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:22.270\nproduct or feature can buy,\nconsidering just how easy it is.\n\n174\n00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:23.530\nIt's really just a,\n\n175\n00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:28.820\nas the way I understand it, it's really\njust a python, a series of python scripts.\n\n176\n00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.150\nSo, it just finds those\ntools on your system and\n\n177\n00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:36.730\nruns them in ways that is\nto the best advantage.\n\n178\n00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:42.090\nSo other things it has on here\nI ran this payload command to\n\n179\n00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:48.540\nshow you the types of stuff it supports by\ndefault that that you can add on to this.\n\n180\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.440\nI mean you take a look at the payloads,\nit's got stuff for\n\n181\n00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.210\nLinux, free BSD, open BSD and\nSolaris right there by default but\n\n182\n00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.696\nthere is also stuff you can\nactually load into it as well.\n\n183\n00:11:56.696 --> 00:12:03.000\nAnd this one from what I believe,\nit's still pretty new.\n\n184\n00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.920\nI believe you can actually write\nyour own exploits for it, too.\n\n185\n00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:12.597\nIt's not as well documented\ncompared to what Metasploit has,\n\n186\n00:12:12.597 --> 00:12:17.522\nbut it does have the ability\nto do some of these things,\n\n187\n00:12:17.522 --> 00:12:22.556\nwhich I find to be a pretty\nbeneficial thing for it, so,\n\n188\n00:12:22.556 --> 00:12:27.696\nbut that is really what Inguma has,\nthere also is another\n\n189\n00:12:27.696 --> 00:12:32.410\nthing inside of this product\nunder applications and\n\n190\n00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:37.551\nexploits, if you go under\nthe exploitation tools we also\n\n191\n00:12:37.551 --> 00:12:43.170\nsee something here called,\ngive it a second, you see [LAUGH].\n\n192\n00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.180\n>> The menu's always just\nkinda give you a little of a-\n\n193\n00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n194\n00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.548\n>> Yeah, there's ginguma here,\n\n195\n00:12:48.548 --> 00:12:52.500\nwhich is just giving you\nsome other stuff in here.\n\n196\n00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.940\nThis one's actually supposed\nto offer a GUI in here.\n\n197\n00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.215\nBut the GUI doesn't\nwant to pop up in mine.\n\n198\n00:12:58.215 --> 00:13:02.760\n[LAUGH] So it always seems to have\na little bit of a fight with me.\n\n199\n00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.349\nBut I don't usually use\nthe GUI on this anyway.\n\n200\n00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:14.300\nI think because, just I'm putting that out\nthere, to that ginguma's there and it's\n\n201\n00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.510\nsupposed to have that GUI and all that,\nbut for some reason, it's not loading.\n\n202\n00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:22.340\nIf you try running Kali 2.0,\nit's still new,\n\n203\n00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:27.420\nit's not working here, I've been\nhaving little hiccups along the way.\n\n204\n00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.502\nI think it's just because\nthe script is still pretty new, and\n\n205\n00:13:31.502 --> 00:13:33.710\nKali 2.0 is still pretty new.\n\n206\n00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.840\nSo it seems like that may have\na little bit of a issue there.\n\n207\n00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.960\n>> And what bugs they've still\ngot to work out maybe with it so.\n\n208\n00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.710\n>> Yeah.\n\n209\n00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:42.390\n>> We can get it updated.\n\n210\n00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:47.073\n>> Yeah don't let it take away from\nthe product because you still got Enguma\n\n211\n00:13:47.073 --> 00:13:50.000\nright here, and\nstill do quite a bit with it.\n\n212\n00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.230\nJust like you have with Metasploit.\n\n213\n00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:58.380\nSomething else I'll kinda note\nhere is that some of the features,\n\n214\n00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:04.380\nthis one like auto-exploit,\nyou should be able to just type in.\n\n215\n00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:12.050\nYou had to type in an IP address there and\nsometimes you get stuff like this.\n\n216\n00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.460\nIt should be taking that.\n\n217\n00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:17.759\nBut if I do it the way it prefers,\nyou can see right up on the menu it says,\n\n218\n00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:19.430\noh, type in auto.\n\n219\n00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:20.980\nI just type in auto scan, right?\n\n220\n00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:26.040\nSo, I know if you type in auto\nscan at the command line or\n\n221\n00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.785\nat the Enguma command prompt, it fires\nit up and asks you some questions so\n\n222\n00:14:30.785 --> 00:14:34.100\nauto-exploits run underneath it so\nI would expect the same thing.\n\n223\n00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.220\nIf you hit it,\nit goes hey it's not defines,\n\n224\n00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.145\nwhat do you mean it's not defined?\n\n225\n00:14:39.145 --> 00:14:43.260\n[LAUGH] So that seems to be\na little hiccup in there as well.\n\n226\n00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.990\nBut you know, I expect them to\n\n227\n00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:53.280\nresolve those things as things go through.\n\n228\n00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.610\nSo just FYI, be prepared for\na couple things and\n\n229\n00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:59.820\nthere might be a problem but,\nwe're good about fixing stuff.\n\n230\n00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:02.470\n>> Yeah something we really have to\ndeal with with a lot of these tools and\n\n231\n00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:03.170\nthis kind of thing.\n\n232\n00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.560\nThey're being developed,\nthey're being updated.\n\n233\n00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.640\nWhich is why we talked about in the\nbeginning when you're setting up Kali 2.0.\n\n234\n00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.225\nWhen we do our initial configuration a lot\nof is testing the tools, making sure\n\n235\n00:15:13.225 --> 00:15:17.050\nthey're going to fire up, if they've got\ndatabases that will need to be updated.\n\n236\n00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.740\nIf they've got configurations\nthat need to be set.\n\n237\n00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.680\nThese are the kind of things that you want\nto find out about before you go out on\n\n238\n00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:26.740\na pen testing job so you don't get\nout there and look silly when a GUI\n\n239\n00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:30.522\nwon't pop up, you're ready to use that\ncommand line interface if you have to.\n\n240\n00:15:30.522 --> 00:15:37.320\n>> Yea, it's, be prepared for these little\ntypes of problems that could pop up.\n\n241\n00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.260\nLike I said, they've been pretty good,\n\n242\n00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:45.562\nlooks like they've been pretty good\nabout keeping this fairly up to date.\n\n243\n00:15:45.562 --> 00:15:49.641\nSo you should be able to see that some\nof these things will be fixed, but\n\n244\n00:15:49.641 --> 00:15:54.205\nI don't want you to kind of, I'm showing\nthese things not because I wanna show\n\n245\n00:15:54.205 --> 00:15:56.366\nyou a bunch of stuff that's broken.\n\n246\n00:15:56.366 --> 00:16:00.024\nThose are really the big ones I've seen\nand that could be a little frustrating if\n\n247\n00:16:00.024 --> 00:16:02.493\nyou get into it and\nyou're like what am I doing wrong?\n\n248\n00:16:02.493 --> 00:16:06.241\nWell it doesn't appear that\nyou're doing anything wrong,\n\n249\n00:16:06.241 --> 00:16:11.091\nI've gone through an updated Kali,\nI've done a second installation of it and\n\n250\n00:16:11.091 --> 00:16:13.750\nit still seems to do\nthe same type of thing.\n\n251\n00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:17.850\nSo it's not just you,\nit's doing the same thing for me here so,\n\n252\n00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:20.610\nyou can run into that.\n\n253\n00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:24.780\nBut I am sure they are on\ntheir way to fixing that but\n\n254\n00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.420\ndon't let it discourage\nyou from using this.\n\n255\n00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.740\nIt's something that can be very valuable.\n\n256\n00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.430\nIt's a very lightweight exploit tool.\n\n257\n00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:35.750\nIt can do a lot of stuff\nthat Metasploit can.\n\n258\n00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:41.270\nMetasploit's far more powerful, so\nif you really wanna get into exploits and\n\n259\n00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:44.290\ntaking advantage of a system and\nfinding vulnerabilities.\n\n260\n00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:45.110\nYou're gonna start going,\n\n261\n00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:50.350\nyou're gonna start, at a certain level,\nstart going rolling towards Metasploit.\n\n262\n00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.860\nBut this could be a very nice,\nlightweight addition to it.\n\n263\n00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.140\nThis was kinda give you a couple,\nkind of a picture on here,\n\n264\n00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.510\nkind of some of the differences\nis when you look at in\n\n265\n00:17:02.138 --> 00:17:06.650\nversus Metasploit you have\nthese exploit modules and\n\n266\n00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.940\nhere you can see that here's the exploit\nmodules that we have available.\n\n267\n00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:16.430\nIt's a far shorter list than what\nwe have inside of Metasploit.\n\n268\n00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:20.560\nBut I would tell you as far as running\nstuff it tends to be a little easier\n\n269\n00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.820\nto run most of these.\n\n270\n00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:25.690\nMost of these you can run, if I just\npicked one randomly off the list here.\n\n271\n00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:31.540\nRemember how in Metasploit we had\nto do load and type all this stuff,\n\n272\n00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:35.390\nthese ones are all loaded and ready to go.\n\n273\n00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:40.130\nSo, I should be able to, for any of\nthese things, be able to just do run and\n\n274\n00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.730\ntype the name of the exploit and\nhit enter.\n\n275\n00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:45.005\nAnd whoops, there's another\none just exploded on there.\n\n276\n00:17:45.005 --> 00:17:48.340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is live, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n277\n00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:53.191\nSo, sometimes that stuff happens,\nbut I've had very few problems like\n\n278\n00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:57.484\nthis with this product, but\nI found that it said it's a very good\n\n279\n00:17:57.484 --> 00:18:02.439\nedition with the fact that I can automate\nit, which is a big benefit to it.\n\n280\n00:18:02.439 --> 00:18:07.780\nIn Python, you can modify the script to\nget more firepower out of it if you want,\n\n281\n00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:12.648\nand Python is a pretty fairly\nwell-documented language at this point,\n\n282\n00:18:12.648 --> 00:18:15.955\nso you can pick up books\nall over the place for it.\n\n283\n00:18:15.955 --> 00:18:18.135\nSo you could really tweak it that way.\n\n284\n00:18:18.135 --> 00:18:23.712\nThe developer seems to be working\non this kind of regularly but\n\n285\n00:18:23.712 --> 00:18:27.612\nI like the fact that this one,\nif you go to Metasploit,\n\n286\n00:18:27.612 --> 00:18:31.732\nreasons why you might choose this one over\nMetasploit when it looks like Metasploit\n\n287\n00:18:31.732 --> 00:18:37.320\nhas been around a lot longer and\nmatured and all that Metasploit is got,\n\n288\n00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.940\nhas got a lot,\ngot a tremendous amount of power in it.\n\n289\n00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:43.140\nBut one of the things that I like is that\nthis stuff loads a lot of these tools.\n\n290\n00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:47.270\nHas access to a lot of\nmapping tools to go out and\n\n291\n00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.760\ndo reconnaissance and\nrun modules and all that.\n\n292\n00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.490\nIt's got those already ready\nto go from the get-go.\n\n293\n00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:54.510\nWhere Metasploit,\nyou gotta load a lot of that stuff in or\n\n294\n00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:58.600\nwrite these big long commands to do it\nunless you happen to be lucky enough to\n\n295\n00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.420\nreally have Armitage loaded.\n\n296\n00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:05.110\nOr just really wanna use that\non top of Metasploit which\n\n297\n00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:07.690\nI do recommend if you've got that.\n\n298\n00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:12.458\nUnless you really wanna go\nthrough everything with the GUI.\n\n299\n00:19:12.458 --> 00:19:14.954\nYou're gonna have to go through and\nwrite all the stuff,\n\n300\n00:19:14.954 --> 00:19:16.690\nwrite the command Metasploit.\n\n301\n00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:20.680\nThis one you don't have to write those big\nlong things like you do in Metasploit,\n\n302\n00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.990\nit's got them right here,\nyou can just do show the module,\n\n303\n00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.940\nshow the exploit, run it,\ngive the information at once.\n\n304\n00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.020\nAnd boom it just starts going through and\nrunning it and\n\n305\n00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:32.030\ncausing all sorts and\ndoing the stuff that you want.\n\n306\n00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:35.340\nI mean, you saw right here, the first\nthing I ran when I went through and\n\n307\n00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:40.200\nran this auto scan, it's prompting for\neverything right from the get-go.\n\n308\n00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.690\nMetasploit doesn't do that too often, so\nMetasploit does do some software prompts,\n\n309\n00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.080\nbut not like this.\n\n310\n00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.400\nMetasploit is a great tool,\nbut sometimes it's overkill.\n\n311\n00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.010\nThis can be something that's like\nMetasploit's little brother.\n\n312\n00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:53.920\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n313\n00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.380\nAnd again, like you always say,\nyou have more than one tool.\n\n314\n00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.540\nIt makes you very efficient.\n\n315\n00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:02.860\n>> Yeah,\nit absolutely makes you more efficient and\n\n316\n00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:07.405\njust to something to really kinda\nemphasize on this is something that\n\n317\n00:20:07.405 --> 00:20:11.580\nMetasploit also it kinda has a big\nbenefit over this one is that Metasploit\n\n318\n00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:15.540\ndoes have a lot of modules written for\nWindows, this one, not so much.\n\n319\n00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:19.850\nSo if you happen to be going\nagainst these Linux and\n\n320\n00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:25.780\nUnix platforms, you're gonna be\nreasonably well equipped with\n\n321\n00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.210\nyou're not gonna be as well,\nif you're going against Windows systems,\n\n322\n00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.510\nthere's fewer exploits against Windows,\nat least at this point in time.\n\n323\n00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:36.390\nI expect that just to grow and\ngrow and grow and grow over time and\n\n324\n00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.642\nnot something I am used to hearing\nnow that I think about it.\n\n325\n00:20:38.642 --> 00:20:40.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I am actually better off with Windows,\n\n326\n00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.850\nnot that your better off at this point.\n\n327\n00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.230\nThey haven't developed all\nof the [INAUDIBLE] points.\n\n328\n00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:47.360\n>> Yeah.\nIt looks like its still fairly new\n\n329\n00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.320\nin that respect.\n\n330\n00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.910\nI expect more of a come\nback as time goes on.\n\n331\n00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:54.570\n>> Very good.\n\n332\n00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.570\nAll right well Sean a lot of\ngood info there on in GUMA,\n\n333\n00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.110\nif I can get that out of my mouth.\n\n334\n00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:04.080\nIn GUMA,\njust another utility we can use to scan,\n\n335\n00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.350\nlook for vulnerabilities, and\nin this one, even take it a step further.\n\n336\n00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:11.620\nStart doing some attacks, or\nsome penetration testing, I should say,\n\n337\n00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.500\nprobably be a better choice of words.\n\n338\n00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:17.100\nAnd we can carry out those penetration\ntests, we can fire up some exploits,\n\n339\n00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.400\nwe can load up the new knowledge\nbases when they come out.\n\n340\n00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.650\nAnd, heck, this one we can even\ncustomize it, get in there and\n\n341\n00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:25.340\nstart writing our own exploits.\n\n342\n00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.150\nVery, very powerful stuff.\n\n343\n00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:28.730\nAny parting thoughts on this one?\n\n344\n00:21:30.495 --> 00:21:33.635\n>> Except there are not really\ntoo many except to say yeah,\n\n345\n00:21:33.635 --> 00:21:35.825\nyou saw a couple things in here.\n\n346\n00:21:35.825 --> 00:21:39.245\nAnd like I said, those were things\nexcept for the last one I typed in,\n\n347\n00:21:39.245 --> 00:21:42.520\nI just picked one random where\nit kinda exploded on me.\n\n348\n00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.270\nThe other ones that I was just showing\nyou, yeah, there are some little issues in\n\n349\n00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:49.130\nhere, but I don't want that to\nturn you too far away from it.\n\n350\n00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.180\nI don't want you go, oh well, heck,\n\n351\n00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.885\nI could have done everything where\nthere wasn't a single error and\n\n352\n00:21:52.885 --> 00:21:54.820\nI could have planned around that,\nbut I want to show you,\n\n353\n00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:59.060\nyeah there are some little things that\nare still a work in progress in there.\n\n354\n00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.110\nBut don't let that turn you away.\n\n355\n00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:03.410\nThis isn't a very very good edition.\n\n356\n00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:06.960\nWhat you should do is if you're\ngoing to do PEN testing,\n\n357\n00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.630\nyou're going to use this tool, learn where\nthose things are and just work around.\n\n358\n00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:17.440\nAnd when they do start getting these fixes\nin there, and addressing these problems.\n\n359\n00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.830\nHeck, then great for you.\n\n360\n00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:23.530\nYou're in even better shape,\nyou know, at that point.\n\n361\n00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:26.230\nBut, it's still very useable right now.\n\n362\n00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.160\n>> Very good.\nAll\n\n363\n00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.380\nright another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n364\n00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.880\nBut for now we are out of time, so\nsigning off, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n365\n00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.870\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n366\n00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:35.995\n>> And we'll

and\n\n3\n00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:17.100\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.860\nIn this episode, Sean, we're going to\nbe taking a look at a program called\n\n5\n00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.390\nResponder and this is one of our man\nin the middle type tools, right?\n\n6\n00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.000\n>> Yeah, definitely fits in that\ncategory of man in the middle.\n\n7\n00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.140\nYou can actually put it in\nsome other categories too, but\n\n8\n00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.320\nI think man in the middle is probably\none of the better fits for it.\n\n9\n00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.790\nSo we are talking,\nas Mike said, about Responder.\n\n10\n00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.550\nWhat Responder is is it's a tool designed,\n\n11\n00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.775\nas you can pretty much guess from the\nname, it's designed to respond to stuff.\n\n12\n00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:47.139\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Shortest episode ever.\n\n13\n00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:49.610\n>> [LAUGH] Signing off for ITProTV.\n\n14\n00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.124\n>> See ya.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:50.124 --> 00:00:50.624\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:50.624 --> 00:00:52.070\n>> Figure it out.\n\n17\n00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.750\nTeach a man to fish.\n\n18\n00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.492\n>> That was great.\n\n19\n00:00:56.492 --> 00:00:57.600\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So, but\n\n20\n00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.330\nwhat Responder does is to really\nkinda put it in the right context,\n\n21\n00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.850\nyeah, it's a tool that responds, but\nthe question is what is the value of what?\n\n22\n00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.330\nWell, what is does it,\nit's a command line tool and\n\n23\n00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.780\nwhen you run it, you tell it\nwhat requests it's looking for.\n\n24\n00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.220\nSo on some levels it's a very, very\npurpose built sniffer if you look at it.\n\n25\n00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.400\nIt's gonna see requests and\ntraffic go across the wire.\n\n26\n00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.294\nBut when you tell it to look for\nspecific requests, when it sees those,\n\n27\n00:01:29.294 --> 00:01:31.172\nit'll intercept those and\n\n28\n00:01:31.172 --> 00:01:35.597\nrespond to them with something\nthat you tell it to respond with.\n\n29\n00:01:35.597 --> 00:01:40.040\nAnd that's where the real value of this\ncomes in because you can use this do\n\n30\n00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.470\nman in the middle attacks, you can use it\nto do, in essence, a poisoning attack.\n\n31\n00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.730\nWe've talked about some of those,\nart poisoning and things like that.\n\n32\n00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.080\nSo you can use it in a few different ways.\n\n33\n00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.219\nMan in the middle would be a very, very\ngood place for this because you could use\n\n34\n00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.673\nit to respond to requests and redirect\nsomeone's request for something legitimate\n\n35\n00:02:00.673 --> 00:02:04.208\nto something that you own and\nfilter the traffic right through it.\n\n36\n00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:09.508\nAnd now you're sniffing their traffic\nhowever you want altering traffic,\n\n37\n00:02:09.508 --> 00:02:12.280\nwhatever you need to at that point.\n\n38\n00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.000\nSo it can actually be,\nin the right or wrong hands,\n\n39\n00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.840\ncan be something that\ncan be pretty vicious.\n\n40\n00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.480\nSo it is something that's included with\nKali 2.0, hence why we're covering it.\n\n41\n00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.980\nIt's fairly simple to use,\n\n42\n00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.680\nit just requires you doing some planning\non what you are trying to accomplish\n\n43\n00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.110\nbecause there are kind of a lot\nof switches with this tool.\n\n44\n00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.320\nWhich I'll kind of walk you through some\nof the switches as we go through it.\n\n45\n00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.307\nNow, what I'm going to do with the\nResponder however is, I told you a quick\n\n46\n00:02:45.307 --> 00:02:50.769\noverview of what it does, but instead of\nshowing you all the bells and whistles and\n\n47\n00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.707\njust kind of having no, and just showing\nyou can do this and this and this.\n\n48\n00:02:55.707 --> 00:02:59.824\nYeah, I'll talk about things it can do,\nbut I'm going to show you an example of\n\n49\n00:02:59.824 --> 00:03:04.020\none of the things it can do and\nsomething that actually is a known flaw.\n\n50\n00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.440\nSo what we're gonna be looking at here is\nsomething that actually is a known exploit\n\n51\n00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.260\nthat you can use on your own network\nduring your own pin testing and\n\n52\n00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.830\ncause a lot of fun with.\n\n53\n00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.340\n>> Okay, time out while I unplug\nmy computer from the network here.\n\n54\n00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.207\nLet me just yank out real quick.\n\n55\n00:03:22.207 --> 00:03:25.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Oriyano's in the building, pop.\n\n56\n00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.950\n>> So this is something that's, I'm gonna\nexploit something that's a known flaw,\n\n57\n00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.550\nand it's something that, like I said, you\nmay very well have on your network now.\n\n58\n00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.100\nIn fact, you're running a Windows network\nand you're running any of the last few\n\n59\n00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.790\ngenerations of Windows, and\nthat includes all the way up to 10.\n\n60\n00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.540\nYou could very well use this in\nthe same way that I'm using it,\n\n61\n00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.380\nto cause some mischief in there.\n\n62\n00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.369\nSo, let's talk about what I'm\ngonna be exploiting here.\n\n63\n00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.460\nFirst of all, before I get to that,\nlet's take a quick look at Responder so\n\n64\n00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.770\nI don't get too far ahead of myself,\nand get all off track.\n\n65\n00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.980\nIt's easy for me to do.\n\n66\n00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.054\n>> It's getting you excited.\n\n67\n00:04:14.054 --> 00:04:16.765\n>> Yeah.\n\n68\n00:04:16.765 --> 00:04:21.430\n[LAUGH] So what I have here is,\nI ran Responder, it's a command line tool.\n\n69\n00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.520\nIf you want to go through and\n\n70\n00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.530\nrun this you can see we have on our\nFavorites menu, we've got on under\n\n71\n00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.900\noption nine I have a Responder\nright down there near the bottom.\n\n72\n00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.460\nOption nine,\n\n73\n00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.480\nI feel like I'm going through voice mail,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n74\n00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.970\n>> And so if you fire that up,\n\n75\n00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.940\nit's gonna bring up\nthis command line tool.\n\n76\n00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.170\nAnd it gives you a couple examples.\n\n77\n00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:49.280\nI'm going to borrow their\nexample IP address and all that,\n\n78\n00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.430\nbut you're actually gonna see it, that\nsame example, what it looks like, live.\n\n79\n00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.390\nSo it's gonna be more than just,\nhey, this is the syntax for it.\n\n80\n00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.810\nI'm just gonna use their stuff, but\n\n81\n00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.200\nyou'll see why I'm doing that in a second\nand what's actually happening, okay.\n\n82\n00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.630\nSo what I have here, as you can see,\nit's a simple command line tool.\n\n83\n00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.580\nIt's simple enough, just use Responder.\n\n84\n00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:18.500\nThe -i command tells it that you want to\nredirect traffic to a specific IP address.\n\n85\n00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.498\nOkay, so when I dissect this,\nthat's what's actually happening.\n\n86\n00:05:21.498 --> 00:05:27.190\nSo Responder -i says anytime someone\nmakes a request and I see a request\n\n87\n00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.070\nthat you told me to look for, it will send\nthis IP address and a response to it.\n\n88\n00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.510\nOkay, so\nthat's what I was just talking about.\n\n89\n00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.950\nI can redirect traffic to a spot where I\nmight be doing a man in the middle attack,\n\n90\n00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.050\nor what have you.\n\n91\n00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.702\n>> Like a phishing type of attack as well.\n\n92\n00:05:41.702 --> 00:05:46.210\n>> Oh absolutely, under the right\nconditions a little bit of creatively\n\n93\n00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.330\nyou can absolutely do that here.\n\n94\n00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.800\nSo, if you go down the list and\nsee the options in here,\n\n95\n00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.500\nyou take a look at what it does.\n\n96\n00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.500\nYou can sit there passively and\njust analyze the traffic as it goes back\n\n97\n00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.950\nforth and write that out to a file\nto see who's talking to who, so\n\n98\n00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.330\nthat would be kind of like\ndoing a crude sniffer.\n\n99\n00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.370\nThat would be good if you're just trying\nto gain intelligence on a network to see\n\n100\n00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.200\nwhat type of things are out there and\n\n101\n00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.360\nmaybe what type of poisoning\nredirections you wanna do.\n\n102\n00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.860\nThat's where that would come in.\n\n103\n00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.350\nBut as we go down the list, take\na look at some of the other options of\n\n104\n00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.750\nthe nastiness and fun and games you can\nhave, you take a look at the basic option.\n\n105\n00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:31.070\nYou could mess with people's option\nauthentications to websites.\n\n106\n00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.030\nYou can do NetBIOS redirections.\n\n107\n00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.380\nNetBIOS domain poisoning.\n\n108\n00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.780\nYou could fingerprint specific hosts.\n\n109\n00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.980\nThat could actually be very handy.\n\n110\n00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.980\nYou remember POF, or P0F specifically?\n\n111\n00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:49.710\nThat we used in our previous Kali and\nour ethical hacking?\n\n112\n00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.770\nWhere we could just turn that on and\nfingerprint traffic as it flows in and\n\n113\n00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:53.520\nout of our system, and\n\n114\n00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.850\nall you gotta do is just browse,\nyou could do the same thing here.\n\n115\n00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.950\nSo that would be really good\nif your sniffing traffic,\n\n116\n00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.750\nyou could use this to see if you could\nidentify the clients and that gives you\n\n117\n00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.790\ninsight into additional levels of\nvulnerabilities that are potentially here.\n\n118\n00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:13.240\nSo, that's a very good thing,\nbut the ones that I'm\n\n119\n00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.590\nreally interested in here is I'm\ngonna use, you can see the -w option.\n\n120\n00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.690\nThis is the one I wanna talk about.\n\n121\n00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.360\nIn fact, we got the -w and the -F option.\n\n122\n00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.048\nBut let's look at the -w option.\n\n123\n00:07:28.048 --> 00:07:29.980\nThe -w, look, it says w pad.\n\n124\n00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.610\nThat is what the,\nwas it Windows proxy or auto discover?\n\n125\n00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:35.331\n>> Auto detect, yeah,\n\n126\n00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:39.036\nWindows proxy auto discover\n>> What that does is, that's a protocol\n\n127\n00:07:39.036 --> 00:07:43.232\nused if you have that little option\nturned on in your browser that's, and\n\n128\n00:07:43.232 --> 00:07:46.838\nit's Internet Explorer typically\nalways has this turned on.\n\n129\n00:07:46.838 --> 00:07:51.769\nAnd I believe their newer browser has it\nturned on that way too, is if you have it\n\n130\n00:07:51.769 --> 00:07:57.107\nset up to say automatically detect proxy\nsettings or network settings or whatever.\n\n131\n00:07:57.107 --> 00:08:01.178\nIt will send out a wpad request,\nand that's basically an APB saying,\n\n132\n00:08:01.178 --> 00:08:05.504\nall points bulletin, saying hey,\nwhat are the proxy settings for this?\n\n133\n00:08:05.504 --> 00:08:10.620\nAnd if someone responds back to that,\nit will give you the proxy settings\n\n134\n00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.890\nto shove into that browser so\nit can browse the Internet or do whatever.\n\n135\n00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:20.545\nThat's what its purpose is for,\nis to auto discover those things and\n\n136\n00:08:20.545 --> 00:08:22.730\nmake things work quite easily.\n\n137\n00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.920\nSo it's a great thing if you're\na network administrator.\n\n138\n00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.970\nYou could set up this wpad\nresponse on your network,\n\n139\n00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.940\nand then when people turn it on it\nautomatically pops into proxy settings,\n\n140\n00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.110\nand they get that and they're ready to go.\n\n141\n00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:43.660\nIdeally if this works the way as intended\nwhich it does on the convenience side of\n\n142\n00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:48.200\nthings, you get a situation where people\nare getting their proxy settings and\n\n143\n00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.470\ngoing on their merry way.\n\n144\n00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:50.990\nThere's hopefully no more of this,\n\n145\n00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.140\nwhat are my proxy settings,\nhow can I get the Internet.\n\n146\n00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.350\nThat's what it's supposed to eliminate.\n\n147\n00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:01.830\nIt did do that, but you don't get\nsomething for nothing, as the saying goes.\n\n148\n00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.040\nBut you do get your money for\nnothing as we learned in the 80s.\n\n149\n00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:06.580\nThat's right.\n\n150\n00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.630\nI went retro for that one, people.\n\n151\n00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.550\nSo I'm gonna use,\n\n152\n00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:16.280\njust to make things simple, as you can\nsee I'm gonna use this responder request.\n\n153\n00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.765\nA responder- i.\n\n154\n00:09:17.765 --> 00:09:21.580\nSo it's gonna,\nwhen something A request comes in.\n\n155\n00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.566\nIt's going to respond\nwith that IP address.\n\n156\n00:09:24.566 --> 00:09:31.170\nThe WRF, it's going to w pad redirects,\nnet bios redirects,\n\n157\n00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:35.600\nand then we look at the -f,\nit's also going to do a fingerprint.\n\n158\n00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.540\nSo I'm going to do all of\nthose things in one shot.\n\n159\n00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:43.830\nAnd what I've done for us to kind of set\nthis whole thing up is I went ahead and\n\n160\n00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.060\nhave had this running here for\na few minutes.\n\n161\n00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:51.090\nTo capture some traffic and\nall the traffic I'm kind of\n\n162\n00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:56.160\nworking with here is on my local box,\nand so you are seeing it right here.\n\n163\n00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.250\nYou will notice right here\nat the bottom as I, and\n\n164\n00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:04.660\nlet me kind of scroll up here so you can\nsee the details that are going on here.\n\n165\n00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:07.014\nWhen I started this up,\n\n166\n00:10:07.014 --> 00:10:12.490\nthere's my stuff I just copied and\npaste that to make it simple on us.\n\n167\n00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:16.250\nI copied and paste that right\nout of the Kali tools file.\n\n168\n00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.820\nSo that is live.\n\n169\n00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:22.210\nThis thing is absolutely,\npositively live, so don't kid yourself.\n\n170\n00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:29.090\nSo it's running the mbtllmnr,\nwhich I always screw up the easy.\n\n171\n00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:33.350\n>> Link local multicast\nname resolution protocol.\n\n172\n00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.574\n>> You want to give\nthe quick rundown on that?\n\n173\n00:10:35.574 --> 00:10:38.270\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Basically it's the, what it is.\n\n174\n00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.410\nStarted in, I think, Vista.\n\n175\n00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.360\nIf I'm not mistaken, it was Windows 7,\n\n176\n00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.920\nbut-\n>> I believe it was Vista.\n\n177\n00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.070\n>> Yeah, that's the IPv6 version that they\ncan use to locate hosts on the network.\n\n178\n00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:53.480\nKinda like what we did with NetBIOS\nin the past by just using Multicast\n\n179\n00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.210\ninstead of broadcast.\n\n180\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.030\nSo it's something Windows machines do.\n\n181\n00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.390\nWhen there's no DNS available and\n\n182\n00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.680\nthey're trying to resolve\na name on the local network.\n\n183\n00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.670\n>> And it's IP6 based, right?\n\n184\n00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.360\n>> It is IP6, yes.\n\n185\n00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:09.580\n>> And if memory serves, SP3 for\nXP you can install it there too?\n\n186\n00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:10.620\n>> Yes, I believe so.\n\n187\n00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.340\n>> Or it has a separate client.\n\n188\n00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:18.740\nAnd I also believe it's also\nsupported in things like the XBox,\n\n189\n00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.450\nand a lot of other Microsoft products,\ntoo.\n\n190\n00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.720\nSo it's not restricted to just\nour desktops and notebooks,\n\n191\n00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.560\nit's tablets and all the other stuff.\n\n192\n00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.580\nSo, I'm going to be responding to that, so\n\n193\n00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.010\nit tells you the type\nof capabilities it has.\n\n194\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.550\nWhen I go through this you can\nsee that when I set the switches,\n\n195\n00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:43.920\nthe responder gives me a quick\nrundown of how it's configured.\n\n196\n00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.340\nSo it tells me if it's\nresponding to requests,\n\n197\n00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.030\nit's gonna act as a w pad proxy server.\n\n198\n00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:52.550\nSo its sending that out.\n\n199\n00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:55.480\nLook at the script,\nyou can actually alter the script.\n\n200\n00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.420\n>> Can you minimize the other two windows,\njust the text is running together.\n\n201\n00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.620\n>> Oh yeah absolutely.\n\n202\n00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.750\n>> Just hide those guys for just a second.\n\n203\n00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.700\nThere we go.\n>> All right a lot better.\n\n204\n00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:08.780\n>> So it's definitely already got\nthe wpad proxy up and running.\n\n205\n00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.420\nYeah, it's up and running.\n\n206\n00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.690\nIt's loading the script,\n\n207\n00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:17.450\nand that script ideally, you would\nreplace that with something else.\n\n208\n00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:22.840\nI'm playing it safe here,\nbecause I wanted to capture traffic on a,\n\n209\n00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:27.460\nor do this to a live network where I'd be\nsure to get a good number of requests.\n\n210\n00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.600\n>> Huh.\n>> I didn't change that, and\n\n211\n00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.590\nI'm not tampering any traffic because\nI don't need all of ITPRO and\n\n212\n00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:34.625\neveryone else to come in here and\ngoing you're not invited back.\n\n213\n00:12:34.625 --> 00:12:36.670\n>> We've lost Internet access.\n\n214\n00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.277\nEverybody's now being\nproxied through your machine.\n\n215\n00:12:40.277 --> 00:12:42.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, but yeah,\n\n216\n00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.660\nI wanted to be a little careful with that.\n\n217\n00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:50.030\nSo, in the real world, you would actually\nchange that to something that would\n\n218\n00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.340\nfit your specific needs.\n\n219\n00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:55.210\nIf you had a different IP address or\na proxy server set up, or whatever.\n\n220\n00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.890\nAnd I mean remember that proxy server can\nbe something that you are filtering your\n\n221\n00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:02.210\ntraffic through, and\nyou could be capturing stuff in there.\n\n222\n00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.130\nSo that is really interesting and\n\n223\n00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:07.815\nintriguing prospect in there that is\nsent through your own choke point.\n\n224\n00:13:07.815 --> 00:13:10.815\n>> This is something that\nWindows boxes do by default.\n\n225\n00:13:10.815 --> 00:13:12.485\nThis is what they do.\n\n226\n00:13:12.485 --> 00:13:13.265\nThey reach out.\n\n227\n00:13:13.265 --> 00:13:16.105\nThey look for that proxy auto detect.\n\n228\n00:13:16.105 --> 00:13:20.595\nIf they don't find it, it's no big deal,\nthey just use your TCP/IP settings\n\n229\n00:13:20.595 --> 00:13:24.855\nlike DHCP or statically mapped or\nwhat have you.\n\n230\n00:13:24.855 --> 00:13:29.730\nSo, in effect if you really turn\nthat on on our network a bunch of my\n\n231\n00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:33.710\nmachines on this network would all of a\nsudden go oh, now there's a proxy setting.\n\n232\n00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.690\nThey'd see the proxy and\nthey would take those settings and\n\n233\n00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:39.540\nthey would configure their browser\nto start using those proxy settings.\n\n234\n00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.910\nAnd I wouldn't know\nthe difference at first, right?\n\n235\n00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:46.020\nAll my traffic is now being directed\nto whatever settings you've used here.\n\n236\n00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:51.760\n>> In fact you say at first if it's\ndone right it may not be at all.\n\n237\n00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.570\n>> Yeah.\n\n238\n00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:58.587\n>> I could very easily just route your\ntraffic of any of these sorts through\n\n239\n00:13:58.587 --> 00:14:03.400\na choke point, and I could actually take\nthis system as the way it is right now.\n\n240\n00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.740\nAnd I could just grab\na USB ethernet adapter,\n\n241\n00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:11.350\nuse my wireless adapter and\njust route traffic directly through this.\n\n242\n00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.100\nHave this running, redirect them\nto this system, at the same time,\n\n243\n00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.020\nrun wire shark and\njust start capturing and whatever.\n\n244\n00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.320\n>> And\nsend it right back into the Internet.\n\n245\n00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.160\n>> Send it back onto the Internet.\n\n246\n00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.370\n>> So, now I'm none the wiser that\nyou've captured all this traffic.\n\n247\n00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:23.380\n>> Yeah, exactly right,\n\n248\n00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.990\nbecause this is just something\nthat's one step in the chain.\n\n249\n00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.150\nSo it's going right on through this.\n\n250\n00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:35.240\nLike I said, I haven't done that\nhere because I'm trying to be safe.\n\n251\n00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:41.658\nI need to capture the traffic rather then\nactually really truly re-direct something.\n\n252\n00:14:41.658 --> 00:14:46.066\nBut, we don't need to see that\nbecause we have enough to show how it\n\n253\n00:14:46.066 --> 00:14:47.340\nresponds at that.\n\n254\n00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.930\nThat's what this main\nconcern is right here.\n\n255\n00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:50.620\nSo anyway,\n\n256\n00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.100\nas we go through the list, you can see\nthe things it's acting as right now.\n\n257\n00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:55.470\nThe types of requests it has.\n\n258\n00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:56.230\nTake a look.\n\n259\n00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:57.000\nEmail traffic.\n\n260\n00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:57.900\nSQL server traffic.\n\n261\n00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.510\nKerberos traffic.\n\n262\n00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.470\nI'm messing with Kerberos now.\n\n263\n00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:07.030\nSo I'm really causing a lot\nof mischief at this point.\n\n264\n00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:11.490\nBut as we kinda skip down this list here,\ntake a look at what's happening.\n\n265\n00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.600\nI see an IP address that came in.\n\n266\n00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.490\nIt went ahead and\nresponded back to it with something.\n\n267\n00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:23.970\nNow, it's giving it bogus information,\nbecause we didn't want to configure and\n\n268\n00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.140\nmess with anything.\n\n269\n00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:26.150\nBut, that could've been,\n\n270\n00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.600\nI could have configured that\nwith anything at that point.\n\n271\n00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.290\nSo, when someone is looking for\nthat name I could have gone through and\n\n272\n00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.020\nsaid when any time this name comes in,\ngo to that ten net.\n\n273\n00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.795\nThat ten net address that I\njust told it to respond with.\n\n274\n00:15:39.795 --> 00:15:40.930\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you see that,\n\n275\n00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:42.190\nyou respond with this, I don't care.\n\n276\n00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.140\nSo broadcast comes back in.\n\n277\n00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:50.380\nNow you're seeing down here, it's telling\nus right away there's a Windows 8.1 Pro.\n\n278\n00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.418\nWe've got a build number,\nit looks like, after that.\n\n279\n00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:55.590\nBut then, ake a look, some of the stuff\nI was talking about there's some\n\n280\n00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:57.471\nreally interesting things going on here.\n\n281\n00:15:57.471 --> 00:16:00.294\nIt's got WPAD right there.\n\n282\n00:16:00.294 --> 00:16:05.824\nSo the same IP that same IP\naddress Multiple times has,\n\n283\n00:16:05.824 --> 00:16:12.990\nwell twice, it's send a Wpad request out,\nand what's happened?\n\n284\n00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:17.590\nI respond back with that IP address,\nso that system\n\n285\n00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:22.750\nhappens to be going to that IP\naddress looking for something.\n\n286\n00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.810\nOr it could be looking for\nsomething there.\n\n287\n00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:29.115\nWhich I told it, hey, here's it, but\nthere's nothing configured there.\n\n288\n00:16:29.115 --> 00:16:32.140\nSo, it sent that request.\n\n289\n00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.985\nI'm just, hey, it goes out, it's got it.\n\n290\n00:16:34.985 --> 00:16:38.265\nThen we also look at something else\nthat's kind of interesting on the list,\n\n291\n00:16:38.265 --> 00:16:40.805\nthe isotap let's go to\nthe tunneling type stuff.\n\n292\n00:16:40.805 --> 00:16:44.745\nIt's actually intercepting those requests\ntoo, and responding back with them.\n\n293\n00:16:44.745 --> 00:16:49.100\n>> These are both again, things Windows\ndoes by default in the background when\n\n294\n00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:54.070\nyour Network Stack boots up, it queries\nDNS, looks for a record name isotap.\n\n295\n00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:58.080\nSo it can configure those tunnels\nto do the isotap with the v6 and\n\n296\n00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.920\nv4 tunnelling and taking advantage of\nthe fact that Windows is doing that in\n\n297\n00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.160\nthe background and automatically.\n\n298\n00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:04.890\n>> Yep.\n\n299\n00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:09.620\nIt's exactly, I mean, as Mike just said,\nit's just sitting here.\n\n300\n00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.000\nIt's passively sitting here.\n\n301\n00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.580\nIt's taken advantage of stuff that\nthese systems are doing normally.\n\n302\n00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:20.610\nSo what we're seeing here is a very,\nvery good demonstration of,\n\n303\n00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:24.810\nat least with the W Pad stuff, you're\nseeing, of course the ISOTAP as well.\n\n304\n00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.730\nAnd I don't think anyone needs to be told\nthat a netbios has more holes than Swiss\n\n305\n00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.040\ncheese.\n\n306\n00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:34.930\nSo W Pad is something that has\na known vulnerabilities with it.\n\n307\n00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:41.440\nSo right now I've got a just plain simple\neasy to execute attack against it.\n\n308\n00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.880\nThat I very well could be\ncausing some big mischief, here.\n\n309\n00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.370\nAnd redirecting people all\nover creation and back.\n\n310\n00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.860\nSo, it didn't take much to set it up.\n\n311\n00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.779\nThere was nothing real.\n\n312\n00:17:52.779 --> 00:17:55.357\nThere was just a quick copy and\npaste on my part.\n\n313\n00:17:55.357 --> 00:17:58.670\nBut you could have typed that\nin very quickly, yourself.\n\n314\n00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.140\nWasn't much to it.\n\n315\n00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.040\nSo it's sitting there, redirecting.\n\n316\n00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.117\nThen I've also got the ISOTAP stuff, too.\n\n317\n00:18:06.117 --> 00:18:08.670\nIt's sending IP6 over an IP4 network.\n\n318\n00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.470\nIt's got that it's intercepting, too.\n\n319\n00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:15.550\nSo in the real world, if you're trying\nto be vicious as a pen tester, or even\n\n320\n00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:20.520\na black hat trying to cause a problem,\nyou've indeed done that at this point.\n\n321\n00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:27.090\nYou've leveraged known vulnerabilities and\nknown issues with Windows.\n\n322\n00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:28.200\nAnd used against it.\n\n323\n00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.570\nAnd by the way, it's not just,\nit's not to pick on Windows.\n\n324\n00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.080\nThere's fun and games for\nthe whole family with this.\n\n325\n00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:38.310\nAnything that, you've got a Mac over here.\n\n326\n00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:42.189\nI've got Linux running\nhere on top of Windows.\n\n327\n00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.910\nSo any of those ones, and even,\n\n328\n00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:50.520\nwe want to throw UNIX in there too, it's\ngoing to be vulnerable to that as well.\n\n329\n00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:51.581\nAnything that does this request.\n\n330\n00:18:51.581 --> 00:18:57.280\nYou saw HTTP in there for example HTTP\nis not a Windows thing, as we all know.\n\n331\n00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.520\nThat can be used across any of those\nthings, I could get any one of those\n\n332\n00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:04.650\nplatforms, plus things like Android and\nall those other guys out there.\n\n333\n00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.760\nThey've all got big targets\npainted on their back.\n\n334\n00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:11.860\nIt's just a question of what do you\nwant to configure and look for.\n\n335\n00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.870\nAnd think about it.\n\n336\n00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:15.360\nThis is just the starting point.\n\n337\n00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:21.140\nYou could have this going, and\nthen at the same time this is going,\n\n338\n00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:25.020\nand doing its job.\n\n339\n00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:29.820\nYou can have some thing else some place on\nthat system or another system some place\n\n340\n00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:36.144\nacting as that choke point, that just\ngrabbing that stuff as it goes through.\n\n341\n00:19:36.144 --> 00:19:40.210\nSome pretty bad and potentially,\n\n342\n00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:44.890\nreally really, just nastiness occurring.\n\n343\n00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.920\nHeck, the Kerberos one in there.\n\n344\n00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.170\nI do not have time to\ncover the attack here.\n\n345\n00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:54.980\nBut let me tell you the Kerberos,\nthis one could monkey with Kerberos.\n\n346\n00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:59.706\nThere's an attack that works right now,\nthat I could bust into Active Directory by\n\n347\n00:19:59.706 --> 00:20:03.094\nusing something like this to\nredirect Kerberos requests.\n\n348\n00:20:03.094 --> 00:20:07.347\nI could punch right in and start altering\nstuff from the domain control and\n\n349\n00:20:07.347 --> 00:20:09.240\nit's not patched.\n\n350\n00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:14.050\nThis would be a way to actually\nstart initiating that,\n\n351\n00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:16.810\nthere's a lot of people out\nthere with their pens, going.\n\n352\n00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:17.370\n>> You're right.\n\n353\n00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:21.890\nSean, you do not have permission to do\na pen test on our network right now.\n\n354\n00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:23.690\n>> That's okay I'll write a letter later.\n\n355\n00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:31.190\n>> A lot of great information there\non Responder, an amazing program.\n\n356\n00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:35.490\nYou can do a lot with it, man in\nthe middle type attacks, redirecting and\n\n357\n00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.290\nresponding to all those\ndifferent requests and\n\n358\n00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:43.830\nable to funnel that traffic\nthrough a chokepoint.\n\n359\n00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:45.730\nAt that point, I could capture it,\n\n360\n00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:50.190\nread it, modify it, pass it along,\nwhatever I need to do.\n\n361\n00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:51.250\nVery amazing.\n\n362\n00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:51.840\nAll right, Sean.\n\n363\n00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.620\nAnother exciting episode, but\nunfortunately we are out of time, so\n\n364\n00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.650\nsigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n365\n00:20:58.650 --> 00:20:59.740\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n366\n00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.593\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n367\n00:21:01.593 -->

00:00:14.170\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.040\nWith me today is the famous Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.810\nAnd in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.610\nwe're going to be taking a look at post\nattack with something called intersect.\n\n7\n00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.060\nSo, Sean is this what we're\ndoing after the attack and\n\n8\n00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.450\nthen intercepting the results?\n\n9\n00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.880\n>> You know it's actually really\nclose it's what it's doing.\n\n10\n00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.190\nIt actually is a part of that but\nthere is something more to it than just.\n\n11\n00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.530\nYou know, yeah it's after an attack and\nit is looking for, you know,\n\n12\n00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.750\ngetting some results and\nhelping you analyze them.\n\n13\n00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.120\nBut it's, there's something that's kind\nof fill in that gap between the two,\n\n14\n00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.890\nyou know.\n\n15\n00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.370\nSo, let's talk about what that is,\nand then we can look at intersect and\n\n16\n00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.910\nmake sure it's in the right context\nwhen we get to talking about it.\n\n17\n00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.350\nSo, when you compromise a system and\nget into it,\n\n18\n00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.290\nthere are some things that typically\nyou're gonna wanna do after you get in.\n\n19\n00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.340\nYou're gonna want to learn\nstuff about the system.\n\n20\n00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.990\nyou're gonna learn stuff about\nthe network that it's on.\n\n21\n00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.320\nMaybe learn more about what\nversion is there of the OS,\n\n22\n00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.940\nmaybe applications and\nyou could go on and on and on.\n\n23\n00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.780\nThere's a lot of things you could do.\n\n24\n00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.970\nYou know, the question is, is how are you\ngoing to gain that information and\n\n25\n00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.790\nthen on top of that, once you gain, once\nyou start you know deciding that you need\n\n26\n00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.660\nthis information, how long is it going\nto take you to get that information.\n\n27\n00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.330\nYou know, so that could be rather,\n\n28\n00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.310\nit could take some length of time, and\nyou really don't have a ton of time,\n\n29\n00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.910\nor you don't want to take too\nmuch time while you're on.\n\n30\n00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.940\nWhen you're on a target or over\nthe target, however you wanna word it.\n\n31\n00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.870\nSo what we can do is we need\na way to speed that up.\n\n32\n00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.660\nAnd the way we speed that up is by using\nsomething such as a scripting language.\n\n33\n00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.240\nI'm sure there are tools that we\ncould install and drop off there.\n\n34\n00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.350\nOne of the benefits about a scripting\nlanguage is that we can run\n\n35\n00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.960\nthe thing and get information off of that.\n\n36\n00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.520\nSo you can get information\noff that system, and\n\n37\n00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.905\nwe typically don't necessarily need\nto install anything, you know,\n\n38\n00:02:10.905 --> 00:02:14.425\non that system which is\njust really a great thing.\n\n39\n00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:19.725\nSo, intersect fills that gap where\nyou've exploited the system,\n\n40\n00:02:19.725 --> 00:02:22.885\nso you've gotten over the wall or\ntunneled over, however,\n\n41\n00:02:22.885 --> 00:02:25.795\nyou've done it, tunneled over,\ntunneled under.\n\n42\n00:02:25.795 --> 00:02:28.835\nIt's late in the day people,\ndon't expect quality.\n\n43\n00:02:28.835 --> 00:02:33.345\nSo [LAUGH] you've gotten into that system,\n\n44\n00:02:33.345 --> 00:02:37.090\nit's like now you need to do your\nsurveillance, get the lay of the land, and\n\n45\n00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.760\nthen figure out what your next\nstep's gonna be from there.\n\n46\n00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.350\nSo intersect is definitely\ngonna help us out with that.\n\n47\n00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.770\nThe way it does that is\nby using kind of some\n\n48\n00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.950\nof the stuff that we've seen with and\nin Gooma.\n\n49\n00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.440\nAnd other utilities, these frameworks\nwhich is what innersect is.\n\n50\n00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.070\nIt's considered a framework where it\nhas modules that you plug into it and\n\n51\n00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.500\nthat they kind of, you plug'em into it,\nthey hang off of it and you can customize.\n\n52\n00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.900\nBut innersect offers something,\n\n53\n00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.920\noffers us something different than\nmeta splitting and gooma does.\n\n54\n00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.950\nSo, we've seen those tools, and we know\nwhat they do or what they're capable of.\n\n55\n00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.190\nWell, now we want to see, okay, well,\nwe've got yet another framework.\n\n56\n00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.210\nWe also saw another framework, if you\nremember, we saw the browser exploitation\n\n57\n00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.970\nframework, or BEF before, you know,\nso we've seen frameworks before.\n\n58\n00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.060\nBut this one offers something a little\ndifferent than any one of those\n\n59\n00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.950\nother ones.\n\n60\n00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.760\nIt allows us to really create\nthose post-exploitation steps, and\n\n61\n00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.700\nhave something we can take over to\na target or run remotely to get that stuff\n\n62\n00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.570\noff a target, which is just really,\nreally awesome.\n\n63\n00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:53.630\nSo what we have is to get into\nthe intersect post exploitation framework,\n\n64\n00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.700\nwe actually have this post\nexploitation section, imagine that,\n\n65\n00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.200\nright here inside of Kali, and\nyou've got intersect right here now.\n\n66\n00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.040\nI have taken the liberty of starting\nit up, and getting it started up and\n\n67\n00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.090\nnice and warmed up for us, ready to go.\n\n68\n00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:17.210\nSo I got intersect, and you can see it's a\ncommand prompt or terminal based utility.\n\n69\n00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.190\nSo it comes up, and you can see it's got\na pretty simple menu, which is great\n\n70\n00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.840\ncompared to the other frameworks we have,\nwe do not need anymore complications.\n\n71\n00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.490\nWe want something that's just nice and\nsimple and easy to work with.\n\n72\n00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.430\nSo let me expand that out so we don't\nhave a lot of text all jumbled up and\n\n73\n00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.820\neverything, on there.\n\n74\n00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.162\nShould have done this earlier.\n\n75\n00:04:38.162 --> 00:04:38.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But,\n\n76\n00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.720\nyou guys gotta realize there's\nthis maximize button and okay.\n\n77\n00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.550\nI just found it.\n\n78\n00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.800\nIt's a new feature.\n\n79\n00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.240\n>> It's amazing.\n\n80\n00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.250\n>> So what intersect does is it\ncreates a custom python script.\n\n81\n00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.570\nSo that's really neat.\n\n82\n00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.570\nYou can create your own Python scripts.\n\n83\n00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.530\nPython isn't that tough\nof a language to learn.\n\n84\n00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.700\nIn fact,\nif you're going into ethical hacking,\n\n85\n00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.332\nit's one of the,\nI wanna say one of the gateways scripts.\n\n86\n00:05:05.332 --> 00:05:05.870\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n87\n00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.690\n>> That's one of the gateway scripting\n\n88\n00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.220\nlanguages to get into.\n\n89\n00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.410\nSo we could create our own modules for\n\n90\n00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.700\nthis too,\nthat puts them well within reach.\n\n91\n00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.500\nBut it also helps us if we don't have time\nto do that we can gather some basic intel,\n\n92\n00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.000\nand surveillance on a system\nwithout having to go to that step.\n\n93\n00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.910\nIf you wanna do more complex stuff\nthen what we can accomplish here,\n\n94\n00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.600\nthen you'll have to basically take\nit outside and do it that way.\n\n95\n00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.220\nBut don't think you have to\nimmediately jump to that.\n\n96\n00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.830\nCuz a lot of times when someone says,\nwell, if you want more power out of\n\n97\n00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.180\nthis thing, you gotta learn to do this,\nthis, and this, you're like, great.\n\n98\n00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.790\nThey've got a tool that does some basic\nstuff, but to really unlock the power,\n\n99\n00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.920\nyou gotta do all this extra stuff,\nand great, I got more work to do now.\n\n100\n00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.780\nOkay.\n\n101\n00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.070\nYeah, you may have to\nlearn Python eventually,\n\n102\n00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.470\nbut don't immediately jump to\nconclusions and think you gotta do that.\n\n103\n00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.150\nSo just knock it off.\n\n104\n00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.761\nAll right.\n\n105\n00:06:03.761 --> 00:06:05.256\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what we wanna do is.\n\n106\n00:06:05.256 --> 00:06:06.752\nIt's gonna create that script.\n\n107\n00:06:06.752 --> 00:06:08.770\nBut before we create the script.\n\n108\n00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.500\nWe have to concern ourselves with\nthese things called modules.\n\n109\n00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.230\nNow you can see you've got\nfour choices on the menu.\n\n110\n00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.050\nOf course we do have sub choices\nunderneath these menus, so\n\n111\n00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.630\nI can just go ahead and\nI'm going to go to option two first.\n\n112\n00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.310\nAnd, you can see,\nit's got a list of standard modules on it.\n\n113\n00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.280\nNow, to keep things nice and simple, I am\ngonna use the standard modules on this.\n\n114\n00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.180\nBut, you'll notice that there's\ncustom modules that allow you\n\n115\n00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.360\nto do additional things.\n\n116\n00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.270\nAnd those have, you can kinda tell\nfrom a lot of the names, what they do.\n\n117\n00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.260\nThey work the same way as I'm,\n\n118\n00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.710\nwhat I'm going to show you\nwith the standard modules.\n\n119\n00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.960\nSo all you'll have to do is, you can see\nright there in innersect menu option three\n\n120\n00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.290\nat the top, right there at the top is\nsomething called load plugin modules.\n\n121\n00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.529\nI think you can figure out what that, you\nknow how you get those custom modules into\n\n122\n00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.980\nInto the actual framework,\nso you can use them.\n\n123\n00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.360\nSo what I'm gonna do is\nlike I said I'll stick with\n\n124\n00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.030\nthe standard modules just to\nshow what the features are here.\n\n125\n00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.550\nI'm gonna generate that script so\n\n126\n00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.820\nnow what I'll do is I will say okay\nI've got these standard modules.\n\n127\n00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.670\nWhat I want to do Is once I have these\nstandard modules I will, you know,\n\n128\n00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.870\nhit, you know, one and\nEnter, and what that's,\n\n129\n00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.410\nit's gonna say here is gonna say okay,\nyou wanna create a custom script now.\n\n130\n00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.280\nSo I'm going back to that original Menu,\nI know what scripts are,\n\n131\n00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.910\nI know what things are loaded.\n\n132\n00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.780\nSo now I'm gonna say okay,\nI wanna create a script.\n\n133\n00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.710\nActually really easy, once you've got\nthe names of the modules that you want,\n\n134\n00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.150\nall you have to do is go in here, and\n\n135\n00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.200\nyou can see it's got that little prompt\nthat little equal sign with the arrow on\n\n136\n00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.990\nit, all you have to do is\njust type in the name of it.\n\n137\n00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.870\nThey give you a nice example, if you wanna\nuse those, those things are already loaded\n\n138\n00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:59.460\nby default creds actually will try to\nextract credentials from the local system.\n\n139\n00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.260\nSo, if you're running that,\n\n140\n00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.241\nthat's what exactly what it's gonna do,\nso you go ahead and enter.\n\n141\n00:08:04.241 --> 00:08:05.350\nAdd it to the queue,\n\n142\n00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.240\nwhich means that's something that's\ngonna process as part of that script.\n\n143\n00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:14.470\nIt's saying, I've got that module in hand,\nand it's in line.\n\n144\n00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.720\nWhat else do you wanna do?\n\n145\n00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.260\nWell, I've got It's got that network one,\nwhich can help you map out the network.\n\n146\n00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.380\nYou can do that.\n\n147\n00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:27.760\nYou can do one's called OS User,\nwhat users are listed on the actual OS.\n\n148\n00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.370\nSo you could go ahead and\nload all these things.\n\n149\n00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:36.440\nOnce you get what you desire as a script,\nyou are comfortable with it,\n\n150\n00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.280\nyou like it, it's really really\neasy to create that script.\n\n151\n00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.490\nIf you take a look right about there on\nthe middle of the screen before I started\n\n152\n00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.810\ncreating a script it says, when you've\nentered all your desired modules into\n\n153\n00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:53.270\nthe queue,\nstart the build process by typing :create.\n\n154\n00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:53.780\nOkay.\n\n155\n00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:59.705\nNow, when I say create, it's It's gonna\n\n156\n00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:05.745\nsay there's some additional\noptions you can put in here.\n\n157\n00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:11.075\nAnd so, these options may vary\ndepending on your specific situation.\n\n158\n00:09:11.075 --> 00:09:13.435\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say,\nokay.\n\n159\n00:09:13.435 --> 00:09:16.745\nWell, what's the name of it,\nthe name of the script.\n\n160\n00:09:16.745 --> 00:09:20.209\nI'll just call it test a script.\n\n161\n00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:26.780\nAnd I don't have to put any .py\nextension or anything on there.\n\n162\n00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.430\nIt will take care of that.\n\n163\n00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:32.760\nSo, just the stuff before that you're\ngoing to want to name the actual script.\n\n164\n00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.480\nNot anything after the period or\nanything else like that.\n\n165\n00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.270\n>> And the difference that depending\non what modules you've loaded up,\n\n166\n00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.540\nthat would determine what other options\nI had to configure at this point?\n\n167\n00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.700\n>> Yes,\nexactly like what we had with Metasploit.\n\n168\n00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.520\nRemember how Metasploit,\nwith the modules options vary.\n\n169\n00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.650\nSame thing here so don't expect\nthe options that you're gonna see on\n\n170\n00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.930\nscreen here to the exact\nsame options that you get.\n\n171\n00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:58.170\nIf you choose the same Creds network\nan OS user that I just chose, yeah,\n\n172\n00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.060\nyou'll get the same ones.\n\n173\n00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.510\nBut if you decide to really go to town,\nand choose as much stuff off the menu,\n\n174\n00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.940\nthen who know's you may get\ndifferent ones in there.\n\n175\n00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.330\nHowever, the cool thing about it is\nif you're with us for Metasploit or\n\n176\n00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:13.480\nyou've looked at the Metasploit\nepisodes that we've done.\n\n177\n00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.370\nYou'll notice that there's a lot\nof similarities between the stuff.\n\n178\n00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:21.310\nSo I'm just going to quickly go through\nthese options and talk what they're doing.\n\n179\n00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:26.520\nAnd you can kinda just fill them in for\nas you see for your situation.\n\n180\n00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.770\nBut you can tell it and the next thing\nit asks you, okay I got the name for\n\n181\n00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:30.720\nthe Script.\n\n182\n00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:36.240\nWell, when you run this on a target\nsystem, a victim system if you will,\n\n183\n00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:41.240\nwhere do you want me to\nstore this actual data?\n\n184\n00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.860\nYou can tell it,\nyou can give it a very specific place.\n\n185\n00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:49.000\nYou can say something like, user/tmp,\n\n186\n00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.820\nit's gonna take this file and\nit's gonna dump it right in there.\n\n187\n00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:55.050\nSo I could, just for\n\n188\n00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.930\nkicks to make sure that doesn't\nexists put some stuff on there.\n\n189\n00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.440\nNotice it even gives you directions.\n\n190\n00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.820\nIt says on the target system\nwhere the gathered files and\n\n191\n00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:11.746\ninformation will be saved to, it needs to\nbe a new directory, so fine, got that.\n\n192\n00:11:11.746 --> 00:11:15.600\nDo you want logging,\ndo you want it to log the whole process?\n\n193\n00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.180\nIf you tell it to log the process,\nwhat's it gonna do?\n\n194\n00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.710\nIt's gonna dump everything in that folder\nwith it, and as it runs the process,\n\n195\n00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.150\nit will flag everything and\ndump it in there along with the report.\n\n196\n00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:26.910\nNot worried about that.\n\n197\n00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.240\nAny port information that it needs,\nyou know?\n\n198\n00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.350\nPort information that the,\nwhen you deploy the script to a system,\n\n199\n00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.660\nwhat port is it gonna use on that system?\n\n200\n00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.720\nIf you need to specify that,\nyou can go ahead and specify.\n\n201\n00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.850\nYou can say, oh,\nit's port 77, if you want.\n\n202\n00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:45.080\nYou know, I'm not really too concerned.\n\n203\n00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:49.470\nRemote hosting the specific information\nyou need there for port information.\n\n204\n00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.250\nAnd you can just see it going through.\n\n205\n00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:55.890\nIn this one,\nI typed in an invalid address.\n\n206\n00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:56.695\nOops, my mistake.\n\n207\n00:11:56.695 --> 00:11:59.355\nI let my fingers slip a bit there,\n\n208\n00:11:59.355 --> 00:12:02.725\nbut that was pretty much\nthe last option in there.\n\n209\n00:12:02.725 --> 00:12:07.965\nYou hit Enter for the IP address, and it\nwill go ahead and write the actual script.\n\n210\n00:12:07.965 --> 00:12:14.195\nAnd once it's written that script you\ncan see exactly where it is right here.\n\n211\n00:12:14.195 --> 00:12:19.920\nWhen that script is written,\nyou can go onto this system and\n\n212\n00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:25.030\ngrab that, and now you can run that using\nPython in each system that you want.\n\n213\n00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:29.120\nAll those modules expand out into scripts\nand assembles them like Legos and do\n\n214\n00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:33.200\nan actual script that now you can run, and\nit will drop all these options in there,\n\n215\n00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.900\nand just poof, right on in and run it and\nget that stuff to you and now you just\n\n216\n00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.430\ngrab that folder, and take it with you\n>> You know that's pretty great when\n\n217\n00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:41.970\nyou first say we were going\nto be writing a script,\n\n218\n00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:46.056\nI was thinking oh great here we go\nI've got to learn how to do all this,\n\n219\n00:12:46.056 --> 00:12:51.440\nwe're gonna watch Sean type in code\non screen, but it knows everything.\n\n220\n00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.610\nIt prompts you for\nall the information that it needs,\n\n221\n00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.270\nand compiles in the background and just.\n\n222\n00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:57.930\nGives you the output and you are ready\nto go, that's pretty dang cool.\n\n223\n00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:03.280\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and you can just do,\nthere's so many options here,\n\n224\n00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:08.380\nif I say you know, if I look at\nthis list of available options,\n\n225\n00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:10.510\nI mean look at the modules\nthat are right there.\n\n226\n00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:15.700\nIt has the ability, if you want,\nif you do option three on here.\n\n227\n00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.570\nLet me go back to the main menu,\nif I do load plug in modules,\n\n228\n00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:23.110\nit can actually download other ones, so\nthere are other modules out there for\n\n229\n00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:28.550\nthis framework that you can bring in, and\npop these in there, and expand it even\n\n230\n00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:34.280\nmore than even the standard and custom\nmodels in there as things go already.\n\n231\n00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.360\nSo-\n>> That's impressive, and\n\n232\n00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.110\nagain, we're doing all of this without\ninstalling anything on the victim.\n\n233\n00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:44.460\nSo we've got nothing really left to,\nnot very much anyway,\n\n234\n00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:49.100\nas in cover your tracks,\nand things like that.\n\n235\n00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.800\n>> Yeah, for myself,\nI look at these standard modules, and\n\n236\n00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:57.010\nI look at these things, and I'm like,\nthose standard modules in this that\n\n237\n00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.270\na You look at them, they've already got\nsome pretty good capabilities in there.\n\n238\n00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.380\nI mean,\nyou've got different shell commands,\n\n239\n00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.920\nmapping out the network,\nuser information that we extract.\n\n240\n00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.225\nBut then you look at the custom modules,\nyou've got stuff remember,\n\n241\n00:14:11.225 --> 00:14:13.695\nwe talked about that\none in ethical hacking.\n\n242\n00:14:13.695 --> 00:14:16.295\nIt's got a module that can\nactually allow you to ping and\n\n243\n00:14:16.295 --> 00:14:21.765\ntunnel commands through the ping\nprotocol that you can install.\n\n244\n00:14:21.765 --> 00:14:24.255\nIt can enumerate open shares.\n\n245\n00:14:24.255 --> 00:14:26.565\nIt can do port scanning,\nprivilege escalation.\n\n246\n00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:29.415\nIt's got that sniffing proxy.\n\n247\n00:14:29.415 --> 00:14:32.780\nIt's got those things\nalready in the package.\n\n248\n00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:37.590\nSo that's already a substantial\nlevel of capability that you can\n\n249\n00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:42.425\nwrite a post-exploit script on without\nactually ever having seen the script.\n\n250\n00:14:42.425 --> 00:14:45.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You didn't see anything\n\n251\n00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.570\nthat had to do with scripting\nin there whatsoever.\n\n252\n00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.558\nThe closest we got to it was, oh, yeah,\ndon't put the Python on the end of it and\n\n253\n00:14:51.558 --> 00:14:53.735\nyou're good, .py on the end and\nyou're good.\n\n254\n00:14:53.735 --> 00:14:55.580\nThat's, that's as far as it got.\n\n255\n00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.740\nIf you wanna learn Python,\ngo for it, \\you should.\n\n256\n00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.550\nIf you're gonna be in ethical\nhacking you should learn that.\n\n257\n00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:04.408\nBut this is some, this is something\nthat you don't even have to do that,\n\n258\n00:15:04.408 --> 00:15:08.141\nat this point even if you know Python,\nyou don't need to go through and\n\n259\n00:15:08.141 --> 00:15:09.878\nrun each script individually.\n\n260\n00:15:09.878 --> 00:15:13.010\nIt takes the modules, assembles\nthem in the order you tell them to.\n\n261\n00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:16.071\nAnd now, you've got a script that\ncreates a folder on that system,\n\n262\n00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:18.340\nit extracts the information,\ndumps it in there.\n\n263\n00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.010\nAnd then you've got something\nthat you can walk away with.\n\n264\n00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:24.850\nIt even archives that information,\nthere's a module in there that will\n\n265\n00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:28.620\ncreate an archive out if it and\njust basically zip all the stuff up, or\n\n266\n00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.040\ntar it up into one file,\nand you take it with you.\n\n267\n00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:31.750\n>> Wow.\n\n268\n00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:35.980\nAnd because, I think you already\nhit on this, we saw that there\n\n269\n00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:40.120\nare the ability to go out and download\nadditional modules, so very expandable.\n\n270\n00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.170\nBeing a frame worker,\nof course, that makes sense.\n\n271\n00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:46.220\nPeople can write other scripts to do other\nthings and you can just bring those in.\n\n272\n00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.520\nAgain, I think you know this as well,\nyou can write your own at this point.\n\n273\n00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.630\nIf you learn python, you can create\nyour own modules to import in there and\n\n274\n00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.550\nextend the functionality even more.\n\n275\n00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:58.170\n>> Yeah, it's just a fascinating thing.\n\n276\n00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:02.040\nThe first time I saw this I\nwas just this is pretty cool.\n\n277\n00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.540\nThis is a pretty cool thing for me to use.\n\n278\n00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:10.970\nIt really acts as an extra set\nof hands when I'm doing this,\n\n279\n00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:14.750\nit's like I can run this and let it\ndo its job and be doing other things.\n\n280\n00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:19.740\nAnd I can run the exact same commands the\nexact same way on multiple systems, too.\n\n281\n00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:24.920\nSo it gives me a great way to\ncompare different results and\n\n282\n00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:25.930\nsee, this is the one.\n\n283\n00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:30.280\nI ran the same tests and this one's\ngot a hole that these ones don't.\n\n284\n00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.920\nSo I'm targeting this guy.\n\n285\n00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.390\n>> Wow, very good.\n\n286\n00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.600\nWell, Sean again a lot\nof good information.\n\n287\n00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.330\nA really cool utility.\n\n288\n00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.940\nSomething we can use that post you\nknow once we've made it into a system,\n\n289\n00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.350\nwe've compromised the system.\n\n290\n00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:45.130\nI wanna start gathering more information.\n\n291\n00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:45.880\nHow do we go about that?\n\n292\n00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:50.360\nWell now you got a really cool little\nscripting capability that you can use to,\n\n293\n00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:55.170\nto grab some of that info and\nleave very little trace on that system.\n\n294\n00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.910\nAll right any parting words for\nus on this episode, Sean?\n\n295\n00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.950\nYeah, drink your milk and\nalways take your vitamins.\n\n296\n00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.350\n>> Always got to say it.\n\n297\n00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:08.250\n>> And aside from that, try this one out.\n\n298\n00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.220\nThis one is a must-try for you.\n\n299\n00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:16.160\nIt's something we have really new and\neasily accessible in Kali 2.0.\n\n300\n00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:21.400\nYou would be pretty much short changing\nyourself if you did not try this one\n\n301\n00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:26.070\napp out and give it kind of a shakedown\nto see how it is going to help you out.\n\n302\n00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.760\nOnce you use it a couple times\nyou will see the power of it.\n\n303\n00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.610\nYou probably will wonder\nhow you did without it.\n\n304\n00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:32.380\nVery good.\n\n305\n00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.800\n>> All right well ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this one.\n\n306\n00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.250\nWe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n307\n00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.570\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n308\n00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:39.550\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n309\n00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:41.230\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n",

Rodrick,\n\n3\n00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.230\nwith me today is your host Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.870\nAnd in this episode, Sean,\nwe're gonna be taking a look at.\n\n5\n00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.710\nDoing some penetration\ntesting from mobile devices.\n\n6\n00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.910\nSomething a little bit different.\n\n7\n00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.380\nWe've done some episodes, I know,\non pen-testing and things like that.\n\n8\n00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.360\nNow we're gonna take a look at,\n\n9\n00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.430\nwhen you say mobile device, assume we're\ntalking about phones and tablets, right?\n\n10\n00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.380\n>> Yeah, we're moving into that territory\nnow is that we're moving off of,\n\n11\n00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.670\nthe mobile devices if\nyou wanna call it that.\n\n12\n00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.460\nOf notebooks and stuff like that.\n\n13\n00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.725\nWhich were called mobile\ndevices at one point.\n\n14\n00:00:46.725 --> 00:00:49.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now we've got another class of,\n\n15\n00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.610\nI guess maybe ultra mobile devices but\nin any case we have.\n\n16\n00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.820\nWhere we are definitely\ntalking about smartphones,\n\n17\n00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.450\nwe're talking about tablets,\nthose type of foreign factor devices.\n\n18\n00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.460\nSo it's something that we really\nhaven't gotten into before.\n\n19\n00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.530\nBut we are moving in there, and\nspecifically we're gonna focus on,\n\n20\n00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.140\nis using those devices.\n\n21\n00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.180\nMore then just a tool to be checked and\npen-tested.\n\n22\n00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.030\nBut instead to turn around and\nactually use that\n\n23\n00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.670\nas the tool that's doing the pen-testing,\nand getting the prep for that.\n\n24\n00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.600\nAnd fortunately, as the world\nhas embraced these devices and\n\n25\n00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.340\nthey've become a much more of\na ubiquitous thing to see.\n\n26\n00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.345\nWe have a situation where there's\nincreasing amounts support.\n\n27\n00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:39.135\nFor these devices as\na penetration testing tool.\n\n28\n00:01:39.135 --> 00:01:41.780\nWe're gonna get that process started for\nyou.\n\n29\n00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.925\nAnd with all the episodes\nwe have coming up and\n\n30\n00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:47.687\ngetting it ready for\nuse as a penetration testing tool.\n\n31\n00:01:47.687 --> 00:01:52.257\n>> It's a big game changer to say that\nI don't need to bring a laptop around\n\n32\n00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:53.730\nwith me when I'm doing my pen-testing,\n\n33\n00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.387\nnow I can do it from one\nof these mobile platforms.\n\n34\n00:01:56.387 --> 00:02:00.717\nI think a lot of things have combined\nas you said to really bring these to\n\n35\n00:02:00.717 --> 00:02:01.937\nthe forefront of pen-testing.\n\n36\n00:02:01.937 --> 00:02:03.357\nThe screens are larger.\n\n37\n00:02:03.357 --> 00:02:08.347\nI've got tablets, big tablets,\nbetter resolution, more processing power,\n\n38\n00:02:08.347 --> 00:02:10.380\nmore memory, better networking.\n\n39\n00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.260\nI mean all of that combined, and\n\n40\n00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.100\nas you said the broad\nacceptance of these devices.\n\n41\n00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.980\nAll the development that's that\ngoing on for these mobile platforms,\n\n42\n00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.350\nall of that has kind of come together\nin this culmination of, making a pretty\n\n43\n00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.680\nimpressive and efficient pen-testing tool\nthat I can carry around in my pocket.\n\n44\n00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.520\n>> Yeah, indeed you can, and that's\nthe big benefit of having a mobile device,\n\n45\n00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.480\nis that.\n\n46\n00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.770\nIf you set it up correctly, and\nget the right tools for it,\n\n47\n00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.330\nwhich is really kind of the tricky part\nstill, is getting the right tools.\n\n48\n00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.760\nIt's not as easy as it would be for\na desktop or laptop.\n\n49\n00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.130\nDesktop or laptop, you still have to\ndo some looking in those platforms,\n\n50\n00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.590\nbut you can find them pretty readily.\n\n51\n00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.560\nbut as far as for tablets,\n\n52\n00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.390\ntablets it does take a little\nmore time to find these things.\n\n53\n00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.170\nMobile devices of any type\ntakes a little bit more.\n\n54\n00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.900\nAnd then which platform you choose\nis really gonna impact your choices.\n\n55\n00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.720\n>> I was really having trouble finding\nany DDOS type tools in my iOS store.\n\n56\n00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.740\nI don't want the deal is.\n\n57\n00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.582\nI couldn't find any in there, right.\n\n58\n00:03:13.582 --> 00:03:14.094\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n59\n00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:16.044\n>> For some reason Apple is not putting\n\n60\n00:03:16.044 --> 00:03:17.560\nthose kind of tools in there.\n\n61\n00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.870\nAnd we shouldn't expect that, right?\n\n62\n00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.910\nIf we have to go outside the norm\nto find some of these tools.\n\n63\n00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.720\n>> Yeah, you're definitely have to go way\noff the beaten path to find a lot of these\n\n64\n00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.900\nthings, and that means that you've\ngot an extra level of burden,\n\n65\n00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.180\nif you will, on you.\n\n66\n00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.260\nTo really test these things out.\n\n67\n00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.082\nAnd get them ready to do that\nwhole pen-testing process.\n\n68\n00:03:38.082 --> 00:03:42.350\nI've got on one of my devices here,\n\n69\n00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.800\nI have a range of tools on it that I had\nto spend a lot of time researching and\n\n70\n00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.700\ngetting prepped and ready for use.\n\n71\n00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.240\nAnd it required for\nme downloading the tools,\n\n72\n00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.880\ninstalling them on a special\ntest device I have.\n\n73\n00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.810\nAnd doing a lot of analysis on it, and\nbreaking open the distributables to\n\n74\n00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.980\nsee if there's anything in\nthere that was kinda suspect.\n\n75\n00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.030\nAnd really doing a lot of checking\nbefore I said, okay I'm gonna use\n\n76\n00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.000\nthis on another on a live device\nrather my testing device.\n\n77\n00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.850\nSo, you will have to\ndo your due diligence,\n\n78\n00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.930\nto borrow that term, you will have to\ndo your due diligence on these tools.\n\n79\n00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.310\nBut if you're willing to do that,\nit can be quite rewarding.\n\n80\n00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.350\n>> Nice.\nSo there are,\n\n81\n00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.420\nwhen we look at the mobile devices,\nwe're really talking about iOS devices,\n\n82\n00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.700\nAndroid devices things like that?\n\n83\n00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.800\n>> Yeah that is what we're talking about,\nis we're talking about mobile devices.\n\n84\n00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.720\nThose two operating\nsystems are the big ones.\n\n85\n00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.535\nThere is another one\nout there with Ubuntu.\n\n86\n00:04:42.535 --> 00:04:44.920\nUbuntu they are putting on\nsome mobile devices now,\n\n87\n00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.540\nin fact you can get an Ubuntu phone.\n\n88\n00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.280\nIf you really want to do that and\n\n89\n00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.850\nI'm aware that there are other platforms\nout there that they run on mobile devices,\n\n90\n00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.160\nbut for all intents and purposes we don't\ncare, we just don't, not for today.\n\n91\n00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.570\nI could care less about Blackberry today,\n\n92\n00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.653\nI could care less about\nthe Windows platform today.\n\n93\n00:05:06.653 --> 00:05:10.111\nIt just that those ones,\n\n94\n00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:14.820\nthey have so they would have some tools\nif someone's willing to make them.\n\n95\n00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.380\nThey probably have a couple but\n\n96\n00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.160\nthey don't have anything on the scale\nthat's something like the big boys have.\n\n97\n00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.120\nAnd in this case, specifically, Android.\n\n98\n00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.370\nAndroid is way leading the way as\nfar as the number of tools in here.\n\n99\n00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.730\nThat's why as far as\nthe tools we're using today.\n\n100\n00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.740\nIt's gonna be the Android OS.\n\n101\n00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.280\nIt's not gonna be iOS because iOS doesn't\nreally have that level of support.\n\n102\n00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.330\nAnd that's we're talking about.\n\n103\n00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.490\nFor a bit here just because you're gonna\nget someone watching this out there,\n\n104\n00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.790\nbut I don't wanna use an Android device,\nI wanna use an iOS device.\n\n105\n00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.888\nOkay, you're probably not gonna use it for\n\n106\n00:05:53.888 --> 00:05:56.914\npen-testing because support\nreally isn't there.\n\n107\n00:05:56.914 --> 00:06:00.450\nI'm not saying you're not gonna find\nanything, and this is not an Apple bashing\n\n108\n00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.350\nthing at all, its just a case of the way\nApple has their stuff structured and\n\n109\n00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.480\nkeeps it so closed, and\nkeeps it so that's their baby.\n\n110\n00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.730\nHow it is with their stuff.\n\n111\n00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.320\nThey pride themselves on the fact that\nwe have this whole ecosystem set up,\n\n112\n00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.680\nand that you have all these hurdles\nthat you gotta jump through.\n\n113\n00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.290\nAndroid, on the other hand,\nprides itself as being a lot more open,\n\n114\n00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.370\nthat really anybody can develop stuff for\nit.\n\n115\n00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.240\nIt's another matter to get\nstuff into Google Play Store,\n\n116\n00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.440\nbecause that requires another\nlevel of authorization.\n\n117\n00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.370\nBut, to get in and do stuff for\nAndroid it's really not that difficult.\n\n118\n00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.700\nThey make a lot of tools available.\n\n119\n00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.320\nIn fact, they have things like\nAndroid Studio that you can download and\n\n120\n00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.180\nyou can start writing,\napplications on there fairly easily and\n\n121\n00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.280\nyou can load them on your devices.\n\n122\n00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.280\nThey do everything to\nshow you how to do that.\n\n123\n00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.040\nSo they're really helping you out.\n\n124\n00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.650\nWhere as iOS,\nit's like you can get there, but.\n\n125\n00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.110\nIt's a lot tougher as developer,\nto do something for and for\n\n126\n00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.050\nus as people that like\nto customize the device.\n\n127\n00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.370\nBecause, if we're doing ethical hacking,\nwe're gonna have to customize that device.\n\n128\n00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.793\nWe have very specific needs.\n\n129\n00:07:13.793 --> 00:07:14.360\nWe wanna be able to do that.\n\n130\n00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.990\nWe wanna be able to do a lot of\ncustomization, get into the OS and\n\n131\n00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:24.710\nget into the kernel and\ndo all sorts of little tricks with it.\n\n132\n00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.110\nYou can definitely do that.\n\n133\n00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.210\nThat's why it's such a great platform.\n\n134\n00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:36.190\nBefore I came here to do the shows here.\n\n135\n00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.280\nI was playing around at home and\n\n136\n00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:46.050\nI was looking for\ndifferent distributions of Android.\n\n137\n00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:50.125\nAnd you have the ones that Google\nreleases and makes available,\n\n138\n00:07:50.125 --> 00:07:54.438\nwhich you can get anyone you want,\nyou can get that all from Google.\n\n139\n00:07:54.438 --> 00:07:58.562\nBut the thing is, is that other people,\nbecause it's customizable,\n\n140\n00:07:58.562 --> 00:08:00.289\nthey have actually grabbed.\n\n141\n00:08:00.289 --> 00:08:06.480\nThe source code which Google, again, makes\navailable to you, they're like go ahead.\n\n142\n00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.950\nYou can download that stuff and\nif you're feeling ambitious enough or\n\n143\n00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.990\nyou have the skills,\nyou can customize those.\n\n144\n00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:18.003\nAnd I was finding ones that were,\nbasically, like Android on a diet,\n\n145\n00:08:18.003 --> 00:08:21.131\nit was like a quarter of\nthe size of regular Android, so\n\n146\n00:08:21.131 --> 00:08:23.119\nit left all these resources on it.\n\n147\n00:08:23.119 --> 00:08:28.223\nFound other ones that had all\nutilities that people never used,\n\n148\n00:08:28.223 --> 00:08:31.164\nthat they stripped out of the thing.\n\n149\n00:08:31.164 --> 00:08:35.799\nAnd ones that customized the kernel,\nto be better for security testing, and\n\n150\n00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:38.100\njust all sorts of stuff out there.\n\n151\n00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.240\nYou're not gonna find that with iOS,\nyou're just not.\n\n152\n00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.990\nSo maybe that will change,\nat some point, in the future, but,\n\n153\n00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:50.240\nright now, it's just not there for us.\n\n154\n00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.710\n>> So, let's talk about some pro's and\n\n155\n00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:56.520\ncon's of moving to a mobile platform\nlike a phone or a tablet, versus,\n\n156\n00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.150\nusing a laptop or\na desktop to do your pen testing.\n\n157\n00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.114\nI'm sure there's some\ngood things about it, and\n\n158\n00:09:02.114 --> 00:09:03.994\nprobably some things that\nmight not be as good.\n\n159\n00:09:03.994 --> 00:09:09.160\n>> Yeah, there are some good things and\nbad things about it.\n\n160\n00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.718\nI might even say,\na more gentle way to put it,\n\n161\n00:09:12.718 --> 00:09:17.170\nis that there's pros and\ncons with anything, right?\n\n162\n00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:21.590\nSo I wouldn't necessarily say there's\nanything bad about either platform.\n\n163\n00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:27.920\nSome people would put it that way,\nand you could put it that way.\n\n164\n00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.350\nI tend to look it as,\nis that there's things where a laptop and\n\n165\n00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:37.400\na mobile platform may not\nbe appropriate for, and\n\n166\n00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.070\nyou can make it work, but they're just\nnot appropriate to that environment.\n\n167\n00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.233\nAnd the situation with\nthe traditional notebook,\n\n168\n00:09:45.233 --> 00:09:50.000\nor environment like that,\nthat's in the Java for ages.\n\n169\n00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.050\nThat really has.\n\n170\n00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.277\nSo what can you say?\n\n171\n00:09:52.277 --> 00:09:55.358\nIt's proven to be very versatile,\nvery flexible,\n\n172\n00:09:55.358 --> 00:09:59.850\nit's proven to be able to let us do\na whole bunch of different things with it.\n\n173\n00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:04.650\nSo you can say a lot of\ngreat things about it.\n\n174\n00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:09.170\nThe big downside of it is,\nis that it's why,\n\n175\n00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.270\nyou've got Notebook or something like\nI've got here, that's very small and\n\n176\n00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.662\neasy to carry, and\nthere's ones even smaller than this.\n\n177\n00:10:16.662 --> 00:10:22.150\nThey're still tough to conceal,\n\n178\n00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:27.550\nand they have, different,\nother limitations on that,\n\n179\n00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.250\nso there will really be that side of it.\n\n180\n00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:36.300\nBut I tend to look at,\nif you still go ahead,\n\n181\n00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.470\nstill keep a laptop or whatever in\nyour arsenal, it's still a great tool,\n\n182\n00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.390\nthe fact that we can do all\nthis great stuff with it.\n\n183\n00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.990\nIt's got all this hardware support,\n\n184\n00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.940\nand we've got all that great stuff,\ndefinitely keep it in there.\n\n185\n00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:49.905\nDon't think that a mobile\nplatform is something that\n\n186\n00:10:49.905 --> 00:10:52.795\nyou necessarily need to\nhave the whole time.\n\n187\n00:10:52.795 --> 00:10:57.928\nNow on the mobile side, the big benefits\nthere, are, of course, the mobility.\n\n188\n00:10:57.928 --> 00:11:03.949\nMobility is a lot higher there, than it is\non a device like a traditional notebook,\n\n189\n00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:08.335\nso, I can carry this notebook around,\nand I carry it back and\n\n190\n00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:10.586\nforth from here and home a lot.\n\n191\n00:11:10.586 --> 00:11:15.151\nIt is easy to do, but\na mobile device is designed,\n\n192\n00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:19.360\nspecifically, for that low form factor.\n\n193\n00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.930\nIt's designed to run\nmuch longer on a battery.\n\n194\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.368\nThat's another big plus with this,\nis that in notebooks,\n\n195\n00:11:26.368 --> 00:11:29.200\nyou can get quite a bit of\nbattery power out of it.\n\n196\n00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.581\nBut, on average, a mobile device,\nbecause of the way they're designed,\n\n197\n00:11:33.581 --> 00:11:36.661\nyou can actually get even\nmore battery life out of it,\n\n198\n00:11:36.661 --> 00:11:41.399\nwhich I think is another really, really,\nreally big plus out of the whole thing.\n\n199\n00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:46.019\nNow something else to look at on\na mobile device, is like I said,\n\n200\n00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:49.830\nit's easy to conceal, it's very portable.\n\n201\n00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.716\nIf you're using something like Android,\nit's getting to be very,\n\n202\n00:11:53.716 --> 00:11:54.930\nvery customizable.\n\n203\n00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.720\nThat's another big plus.\n\n204\n00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.590\nThat one didn't exist\nuntil fairly recently.\n\n205\n00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:06.660\nYou did have before, smart devices,\n\n206\n00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:11.990\nand smartphones, and tablets,\nyou did have operating systems out there,\n\n207\n00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.020\nspecifically, designed for\nthose types of devices.\n\n208\n00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:20.400\nNokia had theirs, and Blackberry\nstill has theirs, you've got that.\n\n209\n00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.800\nBut they were pretty much closed,\ndidn't lend themselves to customization.\n\n210\n00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.900\nAnd if you did want to get in and\nget the SDKs and all that for\n\n211\n00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.280\nit, there really wasn't much power\nin those devices anyway to do it.\n\n212\n00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.050\nThat's changed.\n\n213\n00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.960\nThey're very, very customizable.\n\n214\n00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.470\nIn fact,\nthey're almost as customizable, or\n\n215\n00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.640\neven more customizable,\nthan even a desktop system.\n\n216\n00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.730\nSo you look at the battery power.\n\n217\n00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.490\nYou look at the portability.\n\n218\n00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:45.710\nYou look at the customizability.\n\n219\n00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.900\nThose are all big pluses.\n\n220\n00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:52.520\nSome downsides of it though, that may\nmake it not suitable for every situation,\n\n221\n00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:57.170\nis the fact that you're gonna have\nto get used to typing on a screen.\n\n222\n00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:01.375\nYeah, you can get a keyboard for it,\nbut that gets you back into, hey,\n\n223\n00:13:01.375 --> 00:13:03.815\nyou've really got a notebook\nthere at that point.\n\n224\n00:13:03.815 --> 00:13:09.895\nA very, very small notebook, so\nthat could be a limiting factor.\n\n225\n00:13:09.895 --> 00:13:15.000\nOther things on it is that,\nsome of the hardware that you're gonna\n\n226\n00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.240\nget is just not gonna be able to do\neverything, that we need it to do.\n\n227\n00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.956\nOne of the cool things about having\na notebook is that like the WiFi adapter,\n\n228\n00:13:23.956 --> 00:13:25.650\nthe WiFi adapter's in there.\n\n229\n00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:29.850\nThey, typically, can support everything\nthat we need to for penetration testing.\n\n230\n00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:34.580\nAs of today, there's really only\none device that's been made\n\n231\n00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.960\nthat supports promiscuous mode and\nall that, on a mobile device.\n\n232\n00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.450\nSo that means that your mobile device,\nyou actually have to get an external\n\n233\n00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:46.060\nadapter to be able to support\nthat type of monitoring.\n\n234\n00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.820\nYeah, you can get WiFi support, but\nyou can't get the promiscuous mode or\n\n235\n00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:54.310\nthe actual monitor mode that we need,\nin a wireless adapter.\n\n236\n00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.220\n>> What about system resources?\n\n237\n00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.780\nProcessor, memory, disk space,\n\n238\n00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.400\nhas that become an issue when we start\nmoving to a mobile platform like this?\n\n239\n00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.665\nHave you found any tools that\njust won't run or choke it?\n\n240\n00:14:07.665 --> 00:14:12.638\n>> Yes, that's a very good point, is that\nby nature a mobile device is gonna be\n\n241\n00:14:12.638 --> 00:14:17.474\ndesigned, compared to other things,\nto be a little more underpowered.\n\n242\n00:14:17.474 --> 00:14:23.938\nAnd that's just simply because of\nthe way it's setup and ready to go.\n\n243\n00:14:23.938 --> 00:14:25.996\nThey wanna get the most\nbattery life out of it.\n\n244\n00:14:25.996 --> 00:14:29.793\nThey wanna make sure that if you're\nsitting on an intercontinental plane\n\n245\n00:14:29.793 --> 00:14:33.402\nflight or something like that,\nthat thing's gonna be able to go, and\n\n246\n00:14:33.402 --> 00:14:34.520\ngo, and go, and go.\n\n247\n00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.980\nSo they do that at\nthe expense of detuning some\n\n248\n00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.250\nof the processor power and\nstuff like that.\n\n249\n00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.370\nProcessor, if you just\nspeak about that one,\n\n250\n00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:47.990\nthere are ways you can get around that.\n\n251\n00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:52.113\nYou can do what amounts to\nnot quite overclocking, and\n\n252\n00:14:52.113 --> 00:14:54.361\nthen you can overclock them.\n\n253\n00:14:54.361 --> 00:14:59.552\nI haven't needed to overclock them but\nI can easily adjust the timing levels and\n\n254\n00:14:59.552 --> 00:15:04.609\nall that on my mobile device to actually\ntell it that I need more performance.\n\n255\n00:15:04.609 --> 00:15:08.669\nAnd it will actually tell me if you\ntune this up for more performance,\n\n256\n00:15:08.669 --> 00:15:11.889\nyour battery levels over here\nare gonna start to drop,\n\n257\n00:15:11.889 --> 00:15:14.770\nand your stability's gonna\ngo down on this one.\n\n258\n00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.620\nThey, basically, have got a utility\nthat shows it on three levels.\n\n259\n00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.700\nYou can choose any one of those three.\n\n260\n00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.880\nDo you want it to be more stable?\n\n261\n00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.580\nDo you want to have more battery life or\ndo you wanna have more performance?\n\n262\n00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:30.368\nAnd you choose it and\nit will actually reoptimize the cache, and\n\n263\n00:15:30.368 --> 00:15:36.058\nretune the cores on the processor,\nto make it so it's better for whatever.\n\n264\n00:15:36.058 --> 00:15:40.567\nAnd that gives you something that, it's\nnot necessarily always going to reach,\n\n265\n00:15:40.567 --> 00:15:43.376\ndepending on the device,\nit's not always going to\n\n266\n00:15:43.376 --> 00:15:47.517\nreach the same levels that you have on\na traditional notebook or computer.\n\n267\n00:15:47.517 --> 00:15:52.278\nBut, you can get pretty close, and you can\nget pretty close for what you need to do.\n\n268\n00:15:52.278 --> 00:15:55.516\nYou still can throttle the device\nif you're not careful.\n\n269\n00:15:55.516 --> 00:16:02.064\nIt is entirely possible, and\nquite frankly, on a stock Android device,\n\n270\n00:16:02.064 --> 00:16:07.040\nit's a lot tougher to throttle\nthat device and kill it.\n\n271\n00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.850\nBecause they do put\nsafety measures in place.\n\n272\n00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:12.850\nBecause remember, this is a consumer\ndevice when it ships from the factory.\n\n273\n00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.030\nHowever, what we're doing is taking it\n\n274\n00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:19.860\nout of the realm of a standard\nconsumer device and we're doing that\n\n275\n00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:24.800\nway before we're even turning it into\na full blown penetration device.\n\n276\n00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:30.009\nFor, just to kind of half jokingly here,\nwe're breaking warranties today.\n\n277\n00:16:30.009 --> 00:16:31.650\n>> [LAUGH] You're gonna void the warranty,\naren't you?\n\n278\n00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.105\n>> Yeah we're showing you\nhow to void warranties,\n\n279\n00:16:33.105 --> 00:16:36.170\nand one of the many things we'll\nshow you how to do here on IT Pro.\n\n280\n00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:39.110\nYou'll be voiding that so\n\n281\n00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.620\nwe'll have to do those modifications\nto get where we want to.\n\n282\n00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.500\nSo there are some cautions on that and\nundoing those sorts of things.\n\n283\n00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.300\nSo we're giving you\nthe overview right now.\n\n284\n00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.790\nWe're gonna get on that.\n\n285\n00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.170\nWe are gonna get and\nnot only show you how to do that.\n\n286\n00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:58.120\nBut we're also gonna make sure that it's\nnot just a case of we cut you loose and\n\n287\n00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.790\nsay, hey, this is how you do it.\n\n288\n00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:00.900\nAnd then you're like, wait a minute.\n\n289\n00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.040\nI didn't know that if you\ndid that this happened, and\n\n290\n00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.460\nthis was the ramifications of it.\n\n291\n00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.750\nYeah you'll be aware of that so\nthere'll be little chance of you,\n\n292\n00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:10.123\nunless you had just wanna\nignore the warnings.\n\n293\n00:17:10.123 --> 00:17:13.002\nWanna say, wait a minute.\n\n294\n00:17:13.002 --> 00:17:16.080\nI didn't know it was gonna\ndo that to the device.\n\n295\n00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.685\nThere are some gotchas.\n\n296\n00:17:17.685 --> 00:17:19.970\nThis isn't completely risk\nfree with what we're doing.\n\n297\n00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.393\nSo, yeah,\nyou're gonna void a warranty here and\n\n298\n00:17:22.393 --> 00:17:24.330\nthere's cautions that go with that.\n\n299\n00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:25.217\n>> What about ports?\n\n300\n00:17:25.217 --> 00:17:26.359\nThat'd be another thing,\n\n301\n00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:29.791\nI would think, that would be different\nfrom that mobile device versus my laptop.\n\n302\n00:17:29.791 --> 00:17:30.477\nLots of ports.\n\n303\n00:17:30.477 --> 00:17:33.590\nI can plug in lots of external\ndevices at the same time.\n\n304\n00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.930\nOn the mobile device, not as easy.\n\n305\n00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:41.438\n>> You do bring up a very very good\npoint on that is with a mobile device,\n\n306\n00:17:41.438 --> 00:17:45.691\nyou do have this whole thing\nof having just that one,\n\n307\n00:17:45.691 --> 00:17:50.250\non most Android devices,\njust that one micro USB port.\n\n308\n00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:55.730\nI say at most, I really wanna say\nthat all of them are this way.\n\n309\n00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:00.689\nBut there's probably some device\nthat someone's customized or made or\n\n310\n00:18:00.689 --> 00:18:02.810\nit's out there in the market.\n\n311\n00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.600\nJust a normal device that has\nmore than one port on it.\n\n312\n00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.390\nBut don't count on having\nmore than one port.\n\n313\n00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:12.732\nThat's gonna be a limiting thing,\nso if you wanna do stuff like for\n\n314\n00:18:12.732 --> 00:18:16.764\nexample Bluetooth sniffing and\nyou wanna do WiFi sniffing and\n\n315\n00:18:16.764 --> 00:18:21.199\nstuff like that, you're probably\nnot gonna do it at the same time.\n\n316\n00:18:21.199 --> 00:18:22.696\nYou're gonna have to swap.\n\n317\n00:18:22.696 --> 00:18:26.528\nYou're gonna need to get something,\none of these deals.\n\n318\n00:18:26.528 --> 00:18:31.010\nThis is an Android, oh sorry,\nthis is a USB on the go cable.\n\n319\n00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:35.097\nIt plugs into a micro USB\nport on one side of it.\n\n320\n00:18:35.097 --> 00:18:37.535\nAnd the other side,\nit's got a standard USB port.\n\n321\n00:18:37.535 --> 00:18:38.057\nAnd yes,\n\n322\n00:18:38.057 --> 00:18:42.444\nyou can plug in your adaptors directly\ninto that like you would any other place.\n\n323\n00:18:42.444 --> 00:18:44.405\nYou can also plug in,\nthis is the really cool thing,\n\n324\n00:18:44.405 --> 00:18:45.928\nyou can plug in with one of these things.\n\n325\n00:18:45.928 --> 00:18:49.018\nYou can plug in an external\nhard drive to it, and\n\n326\n00:18:49.018 --> 00:18:52.200\nyou could move data off the thing and\nonto thing.\n\n327\n00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.200\nYou can put flash drives on this thing,\nand\n\n328\n00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.780\nthere's a lot of\npossibilities here with this.\n\n329\n00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.800\nNow the thing that just, FYI,\n\n330\n00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.570\nwe'll mention this again when we get to\nit, because we still got some other things\n\n331\n00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.290\nwe gotta talk about concerning\none of these things.\n\n332\n00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.956\nDon't think you're gonna break\nthe limitations by getting\n\n333\n00:19:10.956 --> 00:19:13.634\na little Y-cable for\nthis, or making one up.\n\n334\n00:19:13.634 --> 00:19:17.765\nThere are people that are doing,\nI know some people are going, oh Sean,\n\n335\n00:19:17.765 --> 00:19:19.276\nyou messed up on that one.\n\n336\n00:19:19.276 --> 00:19:22.353\nWell not really.\n\n337\n00:19:22.353 --> 00:19:23.985\nThose micro USB ports,\n\n338\n00:19:23.985 --> 00:19:29.052\nthey only have a certain amount of power\nthat they put out just like on a PC.\n\n339\n00:19:29.052 --> 00:19:33.011\nThis isn't something that's unique\nto Android or a mobile device.\n\n340\n00:19:33.011 --> 00:19:38.122\nThey just have a little less power\nto go around than even a notebook or\n\n341\n00:19:38.122 --> 00:19:40.371\na traditional PC would have.\n\n342\n00:19:40.371 --> 00:19:44.861\nSo if you do a Y-cable, there is a chance\nthat only one of those devices will\n\n343\n00:19:44.861 --> 00:19:49.158\nwork and you'll hit that limitation\na lot faster than you would on a PC.\n\n344\n00:19:49.158 --> 00:19:52.359\nWhere you plug in one and you can have\nlike an octopus coming out, plug it in and\n\n345\n00:19:52.359 --> 00:19:53.256\nhalf those may work.\n\n346\n00:19:53.256 --> 00:19:55.968\nOr all of it may work\ndepending on what you plug in.\n\n347\n00:19:55.968 --> 00:20:00.480\nYou're not gonna get away with\nthat on a mobile device as easily.\n\n348\n00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.260\n>> You're not going to be daisy-chaining\nsplitters, and getting 128 devices or\n\n349\n00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.500\nanything like that\n>> You can do it.\n\n350\n00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.518\nIt ain't gonna work, but you can do it.\n\n351\n00:20:07.518 --> 00:20:08.886\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n352\n00:20:08.886 --> 00:20:09.908\n>> All right well,\n\n353\n00:20:09.908 --> 00:20:14.220\nso it sounds like the mobile devices\nbig spot in penetration testing.\n\n354\n00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.360\nThey've got a place.\n\n355\n00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.150\nAs you said earlier,\nthey was not gonna replace by laptop or\n\n356\n00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:21.180\ndesktop as a penetration testing tool.\n\n357\n00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.255\nIt's great when I need stealth.\n\n358\n00:20:23.255 --> 00:20:25.657\nWhen I've got one particular job in mind,\n\n359\n00:20:25.657 --> 00:20:28.873\nI've got that particular\nantenna plugged in and going.\n\n360\n00:20:28.873 --> 00:20:34.460\nBut not gonna replace my laptop\nas my main penetration testing.\n\n361\n00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:39.370\n>> It's one of those\nthings that's very close.\n\n362\n00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:40.510\nWho knows?\n\n363\n00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:45.356\nWe could have this conversation six months\nfrom now, and it may be a case of yeah,\n\n364\n00:20:45.356 --> 00:20:46.730\nyou could replace it.\n\n365\n00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.820\nIt's rapidly approaching that.\n\n366\n00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:53.013\nI found that for\nmy regular run-of-the-mill stuff,\n\n367\n00:20:53.013 --> 00:20:58.950\nif you really can say that, I can replace\nthat with it, with a mobile device.\n\n368\n00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:03.271\nI've got a suite of tools\nthat I found far, far up and\n\n369\n00:21:03.271 --> 00:21:07.507\nabove what's available in\nthe Google Play Store.\n\n370\n00:21:07.507 --> 00:21:12.533\nAnd that I've collected that\nI can use to really do a lot\n\n371\n00:21:12.533 --> 00:21:19.757\nof the same stuff to either meet or exceed\nwhat I can do on a traditional device.\n\n372\n00:21:19.757 --> 00:21:23.605\nBut there still are gonna be some\nlimitations there just because\n\n373\n00:21:23.605 --> 00:21:26.180\nthat's the nature of the beast.\n\n374\n00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.006\nBut this platform is rapidly evolving and\n\n375\n00:21:29.006 --> 00:21:33.124\nit's the fact that more people\nare kind of getting into it and\n\n376\n00:21:33.124 --> 00:21:38.457\nrealizing it's getting easier to make\napplications that people have already\n\n377\n00:21:38.457 --> 00:21:43.384\ndone the legwork on customized number\nof versions of Android with custom\n\n378\n00:21:43.384 --> 00:21:48.540\nkernels and tweaks in there to make it\nmore suitable for what we're doing.\n\n379\n00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.935\nThey've removed the limitations on\nperformance and resource usage.\n\n380\n00:21:52.935 --> 00:21:57.470\nHeck, anybody that's got, and\nit's not just an Android thing,\n\n381\n00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:00.640\nit's any mobile device you get,\n\n382\n00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:05.850\nevery last one of you probably\nwithout exception in this room,\n\n383\n00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:10.340\nout there in TV land or wherever,\nhas got a mobile device.\n\n384\n00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.927\nAnd the mobile device you get, you look\nat it and you're like, this is great.\n\n385\n00:22:14.927 --> 00:22:18.770\nYou look and read the specs,\nlook at all the resources it has.\n\n386\n00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.890\nYou ain't getting that because the\nprovider installs all sorts of bloatware\n\n387\n00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:23.250\nand crap on it.\n\n388\n00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:25.930\nAnd some of those things\nyou can't uninstall.\n\n389\n00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:27.180\nThey're there for the duration.\n\n390\n00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:31.170\nUnless you really wanna go through and you\nreally have a vendetta against against it\n\n391\n00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:37.220\nand you wanna get those things off\nthat device which could be a major,\n\n392\n00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.930\nmajor task and\ncould destabilize the device irreparably.\n\n393\n00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:44.200\nThen you're stuck with that.\n\n394\n00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:51.750\nAnd every provider I know, I got my\nSamsung S4, when I got that from AT&T.\n\n395\n00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:54.950\nYou look at the specs for it,\nhey look at all this great stuff it has.\n\n396\n00:22:56.110 --> 00:23:01.160\nYeah, AT&T,\nnot only do Androids suck up some of those\n\n397\n00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:05.720\nresources for it doing its stuff,\nthere's also the stuff AT&T\n\n398\n00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:10.880\nhad loaded on to make the device\nbetter for me as a consumer.\n\n399\n00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.350\nEven if they weren't running,\nthey were something that I never used.\n\n400\n00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:16.630\nI couldn't get it off the device.\n\n401\n00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:22.570\nSo I had storage space being taken up\nby this which was, kind of frustrating.\n\n402\n00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:27.268\nBut that's something that is can be\na big problem with these devices.\n\n403\n00:23:27.268 --> 00:23:29.847\nBut with what we're doing today,\nyeah, we're going to void a warranty.\n\n404\n00:23:29.847 --> 00:23:35.429\nWe're going to get that stuff off once and\nfor all, and just wipe the slate clean.\n\n405\n00:23:35.429 --> 00:23:39.274\nNo pun intended, gonna wipe the slate\nclean and start from scratch and\n\n406\n00:23:39.274 --> 00:23:41.893\nget something that does\nnot have that on there.\n\n407\n00:23:41.893 --> 00:23:46.049\n>> All right, let's talk about\nthe Android security model.\n\n408\n00:23:46.049 --> 00:23:51.029\nI know that's something that we're gonna\nhave to address at some point as we move\n\n409\n00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:55.423\nthrough this process, Yes, this is\none that probably for a lot of you,\n\n410\n00:23:55.423 --> 00:23:59.087\nI don't know anyone out here\nwho has a customized Android or\n\n411\n00:23:59.087 --> 00:24:02.870\neven attempted what we're\ngonna be doing today.\n\n412\n00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:07.280\nBut there are some things with\nthe Android security model that\n\n413\n00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.260\ncould really frustrate you and\ncan cause a lot of problems.\n\n414\n00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:15.200\nThis is why I'll give you my first\nof many disclaimers on here.\n\n415\n00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.850\nIf you're gonna do some of this stuff or\nattempt any of this stuff that\n\n416\n00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:24.810\nwe're gonna be doing today,\nI recommend that you go on eBay or\n\n417\n00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:29.020\nsomething like that and\nbuy a device as your test device.\n\n418\n00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:34.540\nA Nexus 7 which I'm using today is\nactually a great, is a great device\n\n419\n00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:39.720\nto test with, because it's supported by\neverything we're gonna be doing today.\n\n420\n00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.570\nIt's well documented.\n\n421\n00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:44.510\nAnd you can get it fairly cheap.\n\n422\n00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:49.110\nI just bought two of them for\n$120 for both.\n\n423\n00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:51.430\nSo it's a great thing.\n\n424\n00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:54.660\nAnd it keeps me from monkeying\nwith another device that\n\n425\n00:24:54.660 --> 00:25:00.000\nI have already got set up and\nready to go and all that good stuff.\n\n426\n00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.950\nSo the security model\non Android is going to\n\n427\n00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:09.970\nbe one of the biggest barriers\ntowards you doing anything with that.\n\n428\n00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:16.220\nYou know right now you might say well\nI want to do penetration testing.\n\n429\n00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:18.090\nWith the Android, it sounds great.\n\n430\n00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:19.320\nI really want to get into that.\n\n431\n00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:23.580\nSo, your decision is to kind of\nfollow us down the rabbit hole, but\n\n432\n00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:27.360\nyou're like,\ncan we net hunter and pin pad?\n\n433\n00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.410\nThose are pretty involved installs so\nI'm not ready to just kind of take\n\n434\n00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:33.950\nthat journey, but,\nI do have an Android device and\n\n435\n00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:39.180\nI'm going to go through the Google Play\nStore and start downloading stuff.\n\n436\n00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:44.560\nMost people, they will immediately\nget into stuff like and IP tools.\n\n437\n00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.070\nThose are ones I hear about all the time.\n\n438\n00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:53.600\nThere's other ones out there that can do\nstuff on the Google Play store to be sure.\n\n439\n00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:59.480\nBut, there's only so much you can do\nif you just take an Android device and\n\n440\n00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.960\ndon't do any of the stuff\nwe're going to do.\n\n441\n00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.908\nThere's only so much you can do by\ndefault, because a security model is set\n\n442\n00:26:05.908 --> 00:26:10.118\nup in such away that, first of all, you\nget very limited access to that device.\n\n443\n00:26:10.118 --> 00:26:15.011\nYou know, one of the reasons you can't\nuninstall some of that bloatware that\n\n444\n00:26:15.011 --> 00:26:19.751\ncomes from the vendors, is simply\nbecause that bloatware, to remove it,\n\n445\n00:26:19.751 --> 00:26:23.231\nyou have to have a higher\nlevel of access known as root.\n\n446\n00:26:23.231 --> 00:26:26.290\nYou have to have a higher level of\naccess to get that off the system.\n\n447\n00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:29.680\nAnd so they don't give that to you,\nthat's part of the security model.\n\n448\n00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.830\nRemember, it's a consumer device.\n\n449\n00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:35.050\nYou do not want a consumer\nhaving that level of access,\n\n450\n00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:38.240\nbecause they will destroy that device.\n\n451\n00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.150\nYou know,\nnot to be pessimistic about it, but\n\n452\n00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:43.800\nyou guys all know what I'm\ntalking about out here.\n\n453\n00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.300\nYou give that phone, that tablet,\n\n454\n00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:50.730\nwhatever to grandma or\na friend who's not a techie or\n\n455\n00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:54.660\nsomething and they're gonna mess around\nwith it, they will destroy that device.\n\n456\n00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.590\nDon't believe me?\n\n457\n00:26:55.590 --> 00:27:00.605\nGo look at really any version of Windows\nthat has been released in the last few.\n\n458\n00:27:00.605 --> 00:27:02.616\nThat has been released\nover the last few years.\n\n459\n00:27:02.616 --> 00:27:04.280\nHeck, go back to XP.\n\n460\n00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.950\nAs much as we loved it,\npeople would go into that system.\n\n461\n00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.530\nThey'd log into it, say open account,\nthat would be administrator.\n\n462\n00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:13.930\nThe one that you get when\nyou installed the product.\n\n463\n00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:17.370\nAnd that's how it would stay, they didn't\nknow how to create another user account.\n\n464\n00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:21.050\nSo they would just use that account with\nall those high level privileges in it.\n\n465\n00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:22.070\nAnd what'd you get?\n\n466\n00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.150\nA disaster.\n\n467\n00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:26.690\nThat's what you had,\nyou had an operating system that would be,\n\n468\n00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:31.160\nthat was very good out of the box,\nand then it would get destabilized and\n\n469\n00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:35.960\nhave all sorts of problems, malware and\nall other sorts of junk on it over time,\n\n470\n00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:42.110\nand eventually you almost had to nuke\nthe thing and start from scratch.\n\n471\n00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:44.910\nAnd in a lot of cases we\nactually had to do that.\n\n472\n00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:49.320\nWell that's not really as easily said and\ndone, for\n\n473\n00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.230\nthe most part, not easily said and done,\nand I'm going to show you some tips and\n\n474\n00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:56.750\ntricks how to make it a little easier\nwith an Android device, but it's not\n\n475\n00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:00.960\nas easily said and done to do that with\nthese mobile devices, so what did they do?\n\n476\n00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.789\nThey just said you're not getting root.\n\n477\n00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.240\nThat's fine.\n\n478\n00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:11.224\nThat's fine, if you've got a device that\nyou don't need that mobile access for\n\n479\n00:28:11.224 --> 00:28:16.254\nit, let the security model do it's job,\nand don't go after root.\n\n480\n00:28:16.254 --> 00:28:19.158\nHowever, if you're going\nto do what we do today, and\n\n481\n00:28:19.158 --> 00:28:23.094\nyou're really going to use this stuff\nas a penetration testing device,\n\n482\n00:28:23.094 --> 00:28:26.380\nyou're going to have to seize\nthe rootability on here.\n\n483\n00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.870\nWhich means you've gotten\nmore responsibility.\n\n484\n00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:31.690\nYou've got more power on that\ndevice than you've had in the past,\n\n485\n00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:35.730\nwhich also opens up the ability\nto put a better utilities on it.\n\n486\n00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.510\nThere's actually utilities\nin the Google Play store.\n\n487\n00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:42.320\nYou'll see a lot of them that have blah,\nblah, blah, whatever the tool is and then\n\n488\n00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.300\nafter it in brackets they say, root, or in\nthe description it says it requires root.\n\n489\n00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.900\nIt means if you install that tool without\nhaving root it won't work period.\n\n490\n00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.422\nSo it could be a big problem,\nthat frustrates a lot of people but\n\n491\n00:28:53.422 --> 00:28:56.150\nwe're gonna show you\nhow to get around that.\n\n492\n00:28:56.150 --> 00:29:00.350\nBut that's a key part of the security\nmodel, other parts of security model,\n\n493\n00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:04.920\nit has things set up in the device\nthat prevents you from,\n\n494\n00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.230\ninstalling stuff from unknown sources.\n\n495\n00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:10.000\nWell guess what?\n\n496\n00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.230\nThere's a lot of stuff that you can get\nthat's not on the Google Play store.\n\n497\n00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:17.180\nThat counts as an unknown source.\n\n498\n00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.990\nSo it will, as soon as you\ntry to install those things,\n\n499\n00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:22.790\nit will put the brakes on going,\nthat ain't coming in here.\n\n500\n00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:24.300\nIt'll act as the gatekeeper.\n\n501\n00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:28.240\nYou're gonna have to change that and get\nused to the fact that it's gonna scream at\n\n502\n00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.090\nyou and go whoa,\nthis is not an approved stuff.\n\n503\n00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:33.780\nIt's like yeah, yeah, I know,\ngo ahead and install it.\n\n504\n00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.053\nThanks for the warning.\n\n505\n00:29:35.053 --> 00:29:38.649\nYou're going to have to get\nused to that because that's\n\n506\n00:29:38.649 --> 00:29:41.409\npart of the operation of this whole thing.\n\n507\n00:29:41.409 --> 00:29:44.280\nAnd that's not even getting into stuff\nlike, we're not even going to get into\n\n508\n00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.456\nthe point where we have to\nunlock things like bootloaders,\n\n509\n00:29:46.456 --> 00:29:49.150\nwhich we're going to talk about,\nand stuff like that.\n\n510\n00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:53.770\nTo really unlock the security model\nunravel anything, to make sure you just\n\n511\n00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:58.820\nhave a blank piece of hardware to\ngo through and load our stuff on.\n\n512\n00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:00.600\nIt's a good security model.\n\n513\n00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:05.040\nI'm not I'm not it, it, it may sound that,\nit may sound that I'm, that I'm trying to\n\n514\n00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.450\nbash the thing going, oh, well, the\nsecurity model it steps in the way of it.\n\n515\n00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:09.720\nThat's what it's supposed to do and\ndoes it,\n\n516\n00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.300\nit does a really good job of doing that.\n\n517\n00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:15.330\nDoesn't give you that high-level access,\nprevents you from installing stuff from\n\n518\n00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:20.300\nunknown sources and it hides those\noptions, it hides the root you can't just\n\n519\n00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:24.880\nenable, there's a special process you've\ngotta do for installing from unknown\n\n520\n00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:30.150\nsources and checking things\nthat revolves around those.\n\n521\n00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:33.020\nThose options are hid down in\nthe menu because it's not something\n\n522\n00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.490\nthat the average Joes needs to see.\n\n523\n00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:40.280\nSo while they may be in some cases very\ndifficult to get to or just not even\n\n524\n00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:45.510\nsomething that's visible by default that's\na really, really, really good thing.\n\n525\n00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.770\nI mean, we're gonna show you\nhow to enable, when we do this,\n\n526\n00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:54.000\nhow to enable a whole setup and tools on\nstock Android before we've done anything\n\n527\n00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.210\nthat will allow you to do more with\nthe stuff or more with the device.\n\n528\n00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:01.950\nBut it's also more dangerous too,\nin the wrong hands,\n\n529\n00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:04.500\nso that's why they just say\nthat option's turned off,\n\n530\n00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.590\nyou got to know the secret hand\nshake to enable them so to speak.\n\n531\n00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:10.900\nSo security model is pretty locked down,\npretty tight and\n\n532\n00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:15.560\nit is going to stand in the way of\nyou of doing penetration testing.\n\n533\n00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:19.030\nBe aware of that when you\nare going through that.\n\n534\n00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:23.030\nYou have to be aware of the security\nmodel and unravel that security model.\n\n535\n00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:25.200\nAnd I've just talked about\na little bit of it, here.\n\n536\n00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.110\nYou'll have to unravel that\nbefore you can even get to\n\n537\n00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:30.760\nthe point where you're gonna turn it\ninto a penetration testing device.\n\n538\n00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:35.476\nCuz none of the penetration testing\ntools that do the stuff that we\n\n539\n00:31:35.476 --> 00:31:39.260\nneed them to do are going to\nwork with a stock device.\n\n540\n00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:39.770\n>> All right.\n\n541\n00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:41.452\nWell, Sean a lot of good information.\n\n542\n00:31:41.452 --> 00:31:45.240\nAnother great episode, but looking at\nthe clock, we are about out of time.\n\n543\n00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.280\nSo, that's going to do it for\nthis episode.\n\n544\n00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.930\nHope everyone enjoyed watching.\n\n545\n00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:51.100\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n546\n00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.050\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n547\n00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:52.957\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n548\n00:31:52.957 -->

00:00:16.490\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\nwith me today is Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.511\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be\ntaking a look at Kali NetHunter, and\n\n5\n00:00:20.511 --> 00:00:25.001\nwe're gonna look at how we can go about\ninstalling that on an Android platform,\n\n6\n00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:29.377\nand take a look at the interface that we\nget when dealing with Kali NetHunter.\n\n7\n00:00:29.377 --> 00:00:32.987\nSo Sean, walk us through,\nlet's take a look at this Kali NetHunter.\n\n8\n00:00:32.987 --> 00:00:35.412\nWhat is it, why do we want it,\nand how do we do it?\n\n9\n00:00:35.412 --> 00:00:38.976\n>> That's a great question\nto start off with.\n\n10\n00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:41.784\nSo it's the question and\n\n11\n00:00:41.784 --> 00:00:48.230\nyou look at it is why would\nyou want Kali NetHunter?\n\n12\n00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.680\nWell there's a lot of\npotential answers to that.\n\n13\n00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.420\nFirst of all start out with this why would\nyou want this over just a regular Android\n\n14\n00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.160\ndevice?\n\n15\n00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.775\nWell a regular android device,\n\n16\n00:00:58.775 --> 00:01:04.090\na Kali NetHunter is gonna look a lot\nlike a regular Android device.\n\n17\n00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.200\nHowever, the magic is\nhappening under the hood.\n\n18\n00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.521\nWhat they've done is they have with\nthis device, they have done a lot of or\n\n19\n00:01:12.521 --> 00:01:17.191\nthis software rather, they have done a lot\nof customizations of the scenes with\n\n20\n00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:21.540\nNetHunter, stuff that you don't need\nto worry about just opens it up.\n\n21\n00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.410\nSo, you can now use that product to\n\n22\n00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.440\neven a higher potential level than\nyou could with stock Android, and\n\n23\n00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.100\nthen you could even install additional\nthings on top, that really customize it.\n\n24\n00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.000\nYou're taking control of that device,\nis the way I like to look at it,\n\n25\n00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.310\nwith NetHunter.\n\n26\n00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.260\nNetHunter also, over stock Android.\n\n27\n00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.450\nYeah, you can load on stock Android,\nyou can load a penetration testing tools\n\n28\n00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.690\non some, as we said in our previous\nepisode, you can load some tools on there.\n\n29\n00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.510\nBut, the stuff that\nyou're going to find for\n\n30\n00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.490\nthe most part in the Google Play Store,\nare things that either require you to do\n\n31\n00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.810\nat least part of the stuff that we're\ndoing today, or just to use a very,\n\n32\n00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.950\nvery detuned and\ntoned down version of that product.\n\n33\n00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.410\nAnd that's usually a lot of, one of the\nthe things that this acts as a barrier to\n\n34\n00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.390\na lot of people, is that they go out there\nand they get the money and they get their\n\n35\n00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.444\nAndroid device, and like oh cool, I'm\ngonna use this as a pen testing device.\n\n36\n00:02:18.444 --> 00:02:20.100\nThey start loading stuff on it.\n\n37\n00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.340\nOr trying to load stuff on it.\n\n38\n00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.750\nAnd all they find they can get is stuff\nthat will do things like who is lookups,\n\n39\n00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.710\nand tell you what your IP address is,\n\n40\n00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.280\nand tell you just very basic stuff,\nstuff that's not really exciting.\n\n41\n00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.240\nThey want to do the stuff\nthat we did in the CEH class.\n\n42\n00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.090\nThey want to do the pen testing,\nthey want to do the really nice and\n\n43\n00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.750\npowerful stuff, but\nyou ain't gonna do it with this.\n\n44\n00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.660\nYou have to actually do\nsome stuff before that.\n\n45\n00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.440\nJust to stock Android device\nisn't gonna allow that.\n\n46\n00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.679\nYou have to do at least something\nto get the ball rolling.\n\n47\n00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.180\nYes if once you've done\nsome of those things,\n\n48\n00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.880\nyou can take Android just from\nthe get go and do stuff with it.\n\n49\n00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.740\nBut what Kali NetHunter does, is not only\ndoes it allow you to take a stock Android,\n\n50\n00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.150\nyou can break the security model or\ngo around the security model,\n\n51\n00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.400\nand get it so you can install\nmore of that stuff on there.\n\n52\n00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.767\nBut there's still limitations.\n\n53\n00:03:18.767 --> 00:03:23.940\nKali NetHunter on the other hand,\nwhat they do is they took stock Android,\n\n54\n00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.110\ncustomized it, tweaked it, and\n\n55\n00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.160\ndid a bunch of little things to it to\nreally add additional power up and\n\n56\n00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.530\nabove just saying, hey, we're gonna take\nroot access and all that good stuff.\n\n57\n00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.620\nSo there's a big benefit on why you wanna\ngo to Kali NetHunter just over unlocking\n\n58\n00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.950\nand rooting your stock Android device and\ncalling it that way.\n\n59\n00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.400\nKali Nethunter also has another tremendous\nbenefit to what we're doing here.\n\n60\n00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:03.250\nOne of the big benefits of it is\nthat when you use Kali NetHunter,\n\n61\n00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.850\nif you've gone through all\nour episodes on Kali 1.0 and\n\n62\n00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.040\nthen our refresh on Kali 2.0,\nwhich hopefully you have.\n\n63\n00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.000\nIf not, you really need to do that,\nbecause that's gonna show you\n\n64\n00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.660\nreally how to unlock the power of a lot\nof the tools that are in Kali NetHunter.\n\n65\n00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.166\nWhich, you think about it,\nyou've gotta device,\n\n66\n00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:30.020\nyou're taking Kali from the desktop,\nshoving it into a mobile device, and\n\n67\n00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.680\nnow you got the ability\nto do all these things.\n\n68\n00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.912\nBut there's stuff that you don't\nnecessarily need to reinvent the wheel and\n\n69\n00:04:37.912 --> 00:04:40.385\nlearn how to do something\nin a different way,\n\n70\n00:04:40.385 --> 00:04:44.310\nyou've got a lot of those tools\nare carried right on over, just stock.\n\n71\n00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.370\nAnd so\nthat's really just an exciting thing.\n\n72\n00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.760\nMetasploit is on Kali NetHunter.\n\n73\n00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.450\nMetasploit of all things.\n\n74\n00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.750\nSo you've got that right\nthere on Kali NetHunter.\n\n75\n00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.963\nYou can just use the exact same stuff\nwe did in our Metasploit training, you\n\n76\n00:05:02.963 --> 00:05:08.528\ncan take those things and bring it right\non over into Kali NetHunter unchanged.\n\n77\n00:05:08.528 --> 00:05:12.545\nAll you gotta do is tap the icon to start\nup Metasploit, and then just have fun.\n\n78\n00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:17.535\nSo that's just a really,\nreally neat thing to be able to do.\n\n79\n00:05:17.535 --> 00:05:19.294\nSo a lot of tremendous benefits and\n\n80\n00:05:19.294 --> 00:05:22.185\nstanding in the Kali family\nby going to Kali NetHunter.\n\n81\n00:05:22.185 --> 00:05:27.040\nYou've got a mobile device\nwith the power of Kali on it.\n\n82\n00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.940\nYes, there are some tools missing because\nthey couldn't bring them all over,\n\n83\n00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.210\nbut they brought a vast\nnumber of them over.\n\n84\n00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.240\nAnd so you can stay right in the Kali\nfamily and the fact that you can\n\n85\n00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.910\ngo from your desktop device, and all of\nsudden, like oh, well here's my notebook.\n\n86\n00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.810\nAnd I'm working on Kali on it.\n\n87\n00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.190\nWell, heck I need to go over here and\n\n88\n00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.188\ndo something, just grab your device and\nwalk away and start doing stuff with it.\n\n89\n00:05:51.188 --> 00:05:55.120\nEasy, and this like I said, these things\ncan be concealed a lot more easily then\n\n90\n00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.440\na stock, or\nthen a regular notebook would be.\n\n91\n00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.230\n>> And just, I am gonna be the dummy and\nask the question.\n\n92\n00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.656\nI can't get Kali on here right?\n\n93\n00:06:04.656 --> 00:06:08.332\nNetHunter is the version of Kali that I\nwould use if I wanna put this on a tablet\n\n94\n00:06:08.332 --> 00:06:08.916\nlike this.\n\n95\n00:06:08.916 --> 00:06:13.943\n>> I'm gonna, it's not a bad question.\n\n96\n00:06:13.943 --> 00:06:17.380\nLet me tell you why, is probably anybody.\n\n97\n00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.475\nIt's been around this field long enough\nknows where there's a will there's a way.\n\n98\n00:06:21.475 --> 00:06:23.685\nI just saw of all things,\n\n99\n00:06:23.685 --> 00:06:28.320\nI saw someone install a full blown\nKali on, I think it was an iPhone.\n\n100\n00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.170\nSo, people who installed\nWindows 3.1 on an iPhone.\n\n101\n00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.990\n>> So let me rephrase the question then,\n\n102\n00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.180\nKali NetHunter is designed\nto go on a device like this,\n\n103\n00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.002\nwhere as Kali full blown-\n>> That is a better way of phrasing it.\n\n104\n00:06:42.002 --> 00:06:43.820\n[LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n105\n00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.120\nif I don't wanna break out\nthe shoe horn and the WD-40 and\n\n106\n00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.160\nall that good stuff, and I wanna put Kali\nor some type of tool like that on here.\n\n107\n00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.388\nNet Hunter is the version I go with.\n\n108\n00:06:53.388 --> 00:06:59.540\n>> Yeah, NetHunter, it's not a case\nwith Net Hunter where you're taking,\n\n109\n00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.960\ncuz when you use NetHunter,\nyou're still using an Android,\n\n110\n00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.050\nyou're still using a Linux based platform.\n\n111\n00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.930\nKali itself, the big boy,\nis a Linux platform.\n\n112\n00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.490\nSo it makes sense that\nyou could move it over.\n\n113\n00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:20.430\nThe thing is that if you run Kali,\nthe big boy Kali, on\n\n114\n00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.580\na Android device, you're basically doing\nsome form of emulation and you're doing\n\n115\n00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.120\nsome form of virtualization, something\nlike that, that's what I've seen.\n\n116\n00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.357\nSo I'm sure there's someone out there\nthat's really kind gone to town on it,\n\n117\n00:07:32.357 --> 00:07:35.000\nbut it's usually gonna\nbe something like that.\n\n118\n00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.820\nUsually it's just someone going\nhey look what I just did I put on.\n\n119\n00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:44.472\nIt's like so you did it, okay,\nwe're happy for you, it's really good.\n\n120\n00:07:44.472 --> 00:07:46.311\nBut the thing about it is,\n\n121\n00:07:46.311 --> 00:07:52.425\nthat Kali NetHunter is purpose built using\nthe Android platform it's purpose built.\n\n122\n00:07:52.425 --> 00:07:54.211\nFor those devices.\n\n123\n00:07:54.211 --> 00:07:59.389\nAnd so, when you install it on\na device that had Stock Android, and\n\n124\n00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:05.900\nyou put this in place, you get a lot more\npower off of it because it's regular Kali.\n\n125\n00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.410\nIf, like Mike said, if you shoehorn it\nin there, and got all the tools, and\n\n126\n00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.160\neverything out there to put it on there.\n\n127\n00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.170\nYeah, you could probably get some level\nof functionality, but then again,\n\n128\n00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:18.160\nit wasn't built for that, so who wants\nto go through, okay, this doesn't work.\n\n129\n00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.130\nWell, let me go through and tweak this.\n\n130\n00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.530\nThis doesn't work, let me tweak this.\n\n131\n00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.970\nAnyone here around in the early\ndays of Linux when you\n\n132\n00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.720\nhad to compile every driver,\nevery little thing you wanted to run?\n\n133\n00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.830\nThat's what you're looking at,\nthe very least.\n\n134\n00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:38.120\nSo using Kali NetHunter\nis a purpose build.\n\n135\n00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.400\nIt's very, very easy to load.\n\n136\n00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.870\nIt astonishingly easy to load,\nas you'll see.\n\n137\n00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.570\nI guess I shouldn't say that.\n\n138\n00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.181\nSomething's gonna explode or\ncatch fire here.\n\n139\n00:08:48.181 --> 00:08:52.651\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it's amazingly easy to load onto\n\n140\n00:08:52.651 --> 00:08:57.420\na device, and just go ahead,\nand run with it.\n\n141\n00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:02.210\nThat's what I really, really like about\nit is, why mess with the other stuff?\n\n142\n00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:06.547\nWhy mess with just using stock Android,\nand rooting it and saying,\n\n143\n00:09:06.547 --> 00:09:11.203\nwell, heck, I've got a device I can\ndo this stuff on, Kali NetHunter.\n\n144\n00:09:11.203 --> 00:09:12.778\nDon't even have to go hunt for the tools,\n\n145\n00:09:12.778 --> 00:09:14.488\ncause if you rooted to\nstock Android device,\n\n146\n00:09:14.488 --> 00:09:17.910\nyou still gotta look for the tools,\nwhich if you have them that's one thing.\n\n147\n00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.430\nBut Kali NetHunter has, is rooted,\nit's got all those tools in there.\n\n148\n00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.419\nAnd then, if you wanna add more\ntools to it, go ahead, but\n\n149\n00:09:24.419 --> 00:09:27.590\nyou've got a lot of power\nright there out of the box.\n\n150\n00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.760\n>> So what kind of requirements do I have,\nI'm sure I can't pick just any device, and\n\n151\n00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.810\nthrow this on there.\n\n152\n00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:36.156\n>> No, you can't, and, unfortunately,\nit's not something like that.\n\n153\n00:09:36.156 --> 00:09:41.081\nUnlike Kali, it's little more limited\nin that sense, is that we have,\n\n154\n00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:46.977\nI believe it's like eight or nine devices,\nsomething like that, that are tablets and\n\n155\n00:09:46.977 --> 00:09:51.660\nstuff like that, the tablets and\nsmartphones you can load it on, but\n\n156\n00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.966\nyou also have some other devices like\nthe Raspberry Pi, and stuff like that.\n\n157\n00:09:56.966 --> 00:09:59.658\nThey have them all listed on their site,\n\n158\n00:09:59.658 --> 00:10:03.389\nif you wanna go look at the types\nof hardware you can use.\n\n159\n00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:07.995\nAnd we'll talk more about that as we go\nalong, get closer to actually putting this\n\n160\n00:10:07.995 --> 00:10:12.602\non the actual device, because there are\nsome specific gotchas with the Nexus 7,\n\n161\n00:10:12.602 --> 00:10:14.620\nand what's that's gonna do.\n\n162\n00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:17.680\nWhen I talk about those, why those\nmay be specific with the Nexus 7, and\n\n163\n00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.930\ngetting the thing ready\nto put NetHunter on it.\n\n164\n00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.930\nYou can actually transfer those over to\nthe other devices, in most cases, as well.\n\n165\n00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.690\nBut do be aware that the system\nrequirements, you're gonna wanna pay a lot\n\n166\n00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:35.990\ncloser attention to what the system\nrequirements are here, than you probably\n\n167\n00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:42.830\nhave had to on PC side of things,\njust because of the way these devices are.\n\n168\n00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:47.480\nIf you don't follow the guides,\nand you try to use\n\n169\n00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.870\nsystem requirements that aren't entirely\ncompatible, not saying you won't get it to\n\n170\n00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:57.680\nwork, but also before you do that, you\nmay want to read up on something called\n\n171\n00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.790\nbricking a device, because there\nis a chance you could do that.\n\n172\n00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:06.190\nI saw someone in the the chat\nroom here on the break,\n\n173\n00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.090\nmentioned about bricking a device.\n\n174\n00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:13.090\nBricking a device, what that refers to is,\nbasically, taking this device,\n\n175\n00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.590\nand turning it into a brick,okay?\n\n176\n00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.250\nThat's a simple description of it.\n\n177\n00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:22.000\nWell, the thing is, is that just FYI,\nI don't want anyone to sit here and go,\n\n178\n00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.420\nokay, well, I'm gonna pay all this money\nfor a device, and oops, I could brick it?\n\n179\n00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.110\nAnd all of a sudden, that's it?\n\n180\n00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:28.510\nIt's a paper weight?\n\n181\n00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:32.040\nThere's soft bricking and\nthere's hard bricking a device.\n\n182\n00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.260\nIf you hard brick a device,\nit's very tough to come back from that.\n\n183\n00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:40.860\nIf you soft brick a device, which is\nprobably, I could probably say that\n\n184\n00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:44.790\nevery last person that watches this,\nis at some point gonna do that,\n\n185\n00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:48.100\nthat's just something that's the teething\npains that go with setting this up.\n\n186\n00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.910\nFortunately, Kali NetHunter\nis very forgiving, and\n\n187\n00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.670\nthere's other tools I'm gonna show you\nthat can get you out of a soft brick.\n\n188\n00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.074\nRather than you sitting here and\npulling your hair out.\n\n189\n00:11:58.074 --> 00:12:00.405\nI've already pulled mine out,\nso I've done the work for you.\n\n190\n00:12:00.405 --> 00:12:04.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm gonna save you a lot of those.\n\n191\n00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.970\nThe sleepless nights, and\nthat frustration, and\n\n192\n00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:08.050\nthe drinking, and all that.\n\n193\n00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:09.430\nI'm gonna save you some time there,\n\n194\n00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:13.500\nby showing you ways to get\nout of a soft brick device.\n\n195\n00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:18.900\nSo if you mess up or\nyou have a hiccup, you can fix some of\n\n196\n00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:25.340\nthis stuff on Nexus devices at least,\nso I just want you to be aware of that.\n\n197\n00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.760\nThe system requirements\ndo pay close attention.\n\n198\n00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:33.170\nIf you wanna do a Kali Nethunter device,\ndon't go out to Ebay or Amazon and\n\n199\n00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:38.610\njust buy a device, because it's got\na good price or it looks nice to you.\n\n200\n00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.890\nMake sure the device you're buying\nis something that's also listed on\n\n201\n00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:46.560\nthe actual Kali NetHunter site.\n\n202\n00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.440\nDo your research to see even\noutside the Kali NetHunter site.\n\n203\n00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.090\nSee if that device,\nwhat issues people have had with it.\n\n204\n00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:59.440\nLike I said,\nI chose a Nexus 7 just because it\n\n205\n00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:05.700\nwas easily supported,\nit has long legs on it, so\n\n206\n00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:12.480\nit's got a lot of support and information\nbehind it, and made it easier on me.\n\n207\n00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.190\nProblem with it is, is that when\nyou get into Modding Android and\n\n208\n00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:21.150\ndoing stuff with it,\nthe information's still scattered here and\n\n209\n00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.530\nback, which is another reason why\nyou wanna use Kali Nethunter.\n\n210\n00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.217\nNethunter centralizes all around\nthe Nethunter platform, rather than,\n\n211\n00:13:28.217 --> 00:13:29.689\nyou just go in some other way.\n\n212\n00:13:29.689 --> 00:13:32.332\nBut be aware of that,\nthat there can be some things,\n\n213\n00:13:32.332 --> 00:13:36.015\nthe limiting things that could cause\nlittle hiccups in there with this.\n\n214\n00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:37.472\nBut we're gonna get you around that.\n\n215\n00:13:37.472 --> 00:13:42.709\nDevice support, make sure, again,\nthat you go to the Kali NetHunter site,\n\n216\n00:13:42.709 --> 00:13:45.760\nand look at the devices\nthere on that site.\n\n217\n00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.290\nDo not just go ahead in Google and\n\n218\n00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.360\nsay, oh, what devices\nare compatible with Kali NetHunter?\n\n219\n00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.420\nBecause you know the way\nthe internet works.\n\n220\n00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.890\nPeople put anything up there.\n\n221\n00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:57.554\nOf course, you can't lie on the Internet,\nso everything should be true.\n\n222\n00:13:57.554 --> 00:14:00.752\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just be careful.\n\n223\n00:14:01.875 --> 00:14:06.365\nIf you wanna put in the time,\nyou can make Kali and Android and\n\n224\n00:14:06.365 --> 00:14:08.695\nall that, work on any device you want.\n\n225\n00:14:08.695 --> 00:14:11.665\nI don't have that type of time, I don't\nthink you wanna invest that type of time.\n\n226\n00:14:11.665 --> 00:14:14.372\nYou want something that works and\nis reliable.\n\n227\n00:14:14.372 --> 00:14:17.262\nAnd you're not constantly trying to\nsit there and pick up the pieces, and\n\n228\n00:14:17.262 --> 00:14:19.482\nput them back together,\nbecause it exploded for\n\n229\n00:14:19.482 --> 00:14:24.372\nthe nth time, because it was some\nreally unsupported configuration.\n\n230\n00:14:24.372 --> 00:14:25.330\n>> Good.\n\n231\n00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.305\nAll right so, a lot of good info there,\nwe want to, so\n\n232\n00:14:28.305 --> 00:14:32.626\nwe talked about the requirements,\nwe talked about why, what do we got next?\n\n233\n00:14:32.626 --> 00:14:37.802\nWell, we're looking at this,\nlet's talk about when we go through this,\n\n234\n00:14:37.802 --> 00:14:40.851\nand we talked about why\nuse Kali NetHunter.\n\n235\n00:14:40.851 --> 00:14:43.672\nWe're talking about, so we're starting to\nget into some of the system requirements\n\n236\n00:14:43.672 --> 00:14:44.587\nand device requirements.\n\n237\n00:14:44.587 --> 00:14:49.449\nWell, I want to give you\na chance to compare and\n\n238\n00:14:49.449 --> 00:14:53.439\ncontrast this, as much as possible,\n\n239\n00:14:53.439 --> 00:14:58.819\nbetween Kali NetHunter in\na stock Android device.\n\n240\n00:14:58.819 --> 00:15:02.348\nSo what I have done here\nto make things easy is,\n\n241\n00:15:02.348 --> 00:15:07.141\nI have a stock Android device,\nand to show you how easy this is,\n\n242\n00:15:07.141 --> 00:15:11.767\nI literally, and I am gonna show\nyou how to do this yourself.\n\n243\n00:15:11.767 --> 00:15:17.138\nIs I reset up one of my devices here,\nthis tablet when I came in here,\n\n244\n00:15:17.138 --> 00:15:24.368\nfilming for the first episode today, this\nactually was not running a stock Android.\n\n245\n00:15:24.368 --> 00:15:26.018\nAnd I,\n\n246\n00:15:26.018 --> 00:15:30.028\nover the course of a single episode,\nI flashed it back to stock Android.\n\n247\n00:15:30.028 --> 00:15:31.680\nIt's all set up back to the way it is.\n\n248\n00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:37.323\nSo this is a plain,\nvanilla running Android 5.11 device.\n\n249\n00:15:37.323 --> 00:15:41.867\nSo that just shows you how easy it is\nto get back to doing stock Android\n\n250\n00:15:41.867 --> 00:15:43.402\nif you mess up, okay?\n\n251\n00:15:43.402 --> 00:15:45.132\nSo that's something I\njust wanted to point out.\n\n252\n00:15:45.132 --> 00:15:46.525\n>> [LAUGH] Always good to know.\n\n253\n00:15:46.525 --> 00:15:50.646\n>> Yeah, I'm trying to make it so\nI don't want anyone feeling.\n\n254\n00:15:50.646 --> 00:15:55.540\nIntimidated by this process, I want to\nbe in a nice accessible process to you.\n\n255\n00:15:55.540 --> 00:16:01.140\nWhat we're looking at here is this\nactually is a stock Android device.\n\n256\n00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.770\nThere's no special things going on here.\n\n257\n00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:05.370\nI haven't customized this thing and\nat all.\n\n258\n00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:09.870\nYou can see it's actually still It's\ndoing the initial setup type stuff,\n\n259\n00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.230\ngoing hey here's how you use your device.\n\n260\n00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:16.490\nBut it's just to show you this is\nsomething that's right out of the box.\n\n261\n00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.550\nThere's your widgets,\n\n262\n00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:23.500\nwe can scroll back these\nare the stock apps that come with it.\n\n263\n00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.420\nThis also shows one of the reasons\nwhy stock Android tend to\n\n264\n00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.810\nif I'm gonna do anything\nto customize stock Android.\n\n265\n00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:35.260\nOur customized Android,\nI like doing stock,\n\n266\n00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:40.100\njust because it's got very little\nbloatware or anything else on it.\n\n267\n00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.450\nThere's really not, there's very,\nvery little on there.\n\n268\n00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:44.190\nYou can see it on one screen.\n\n269\n00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:44.930\nBut.\n\n270\n00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:49.760\nYou can see, for those who have\nan Android device, there's really not,\n\n271\n00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:55.160\nthere's nothing really\nkind of strange here.\n\n272\n00:16:55.160 --> 00:17:00.250\nThis is just you might have\ndifferent apps installed on yours.\n\n273\n00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:06.230\nYou might be familiar with\nthe different things on your device.\n\n274\n00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:10.290\nBut this is still something I just set\nup to show you, hey, I am not doing any\n\n275\n00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:14.280\nfunny business, this is just a regular\nAndroid device being set up.\n\n276\n00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.780\nIt is something that you would get.\n\n277\n00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:18.850\nYou might have different apps.\n\n278\n00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:21.080\nYou may have done\ndifferent customizations.\n\n279\n00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.190\nBut this is just as simple as it gets.\n\n280\n00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.750\nSo we see this interface and\nhow it looks, and\n\n281\n00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:32.820\nall the little configurations\noptions in there, fine.\n\n282\n00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:37.636\nSo we've got that one, that's Android 5.1.\n\n283\n00:17:37.636 --> 00:17:43.400\nAnd we will be customizing this\ndevice as we go further into this.\n\n284\n00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:48.120\nNow what we have over here to\nkinda do a compare and contrast.\n\n285\n00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:53.150\nAnd maybe we can kind of show the two in\nhere a little side by side comparison\n\n286\n00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:57.470\nin here to make it a little easier for\nyou, is that you have,\n\n287\n00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:02.100\nyou have this,\nstock Android device running 5.1.\n\n288\n00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.260\nThis is NetHunter.\n\n289\n00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:09.490\nNetHunter, I've got my tools right here\nthat have been instaled.l these for\n\n290\n00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:13.290\nmy penetration testing tools so\nI can click on these various things.\n\n291\n00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:18.600\nThere's my wireless tools that\nare installed, we'll take a look at that.\n\n292\n00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.485\nWe won't worry about those things now.\n\n293\n00:18:21.485 --> 00:18:23.465\nNow just taking a look at the interface.\n\n294\n00:18:23.465 --> 00:18:26.035\nYou'll notice that is why\nI have done some, and\n\n295\n00:18:26.035 --> 00:18:30.855\nlet me turn the brightness down there for\nyou a bit, so\n\n296\n00:18:30.855 --> 00:18:34.645\nmaybe it's a little more viewable for\nyou there at home.\n\n297\n00:18:34.645 --> 00:18:37.125\nBut what we have here is,\n\n298\n00:18:37.125 --> 00:18:41.460\nI've loaded some stuff on top\nof this Kali NetHunter Distro.\n\n299\n00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.900\nBut I've got a, it's pretty much\n\n300\n00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.470\nthe stuff you would expect again\nwith this Android device over here.\n\n301\n00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:50.340\nYou can just go through,\ntap on the apps, and all that.\n\n302\n00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:54.320\nThe power comes in the fact\nthat this device over\n\n303\n00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.810\nhere as opposed to this device,\nthis device is rooted.\n\n304\n00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:03.260\nSo this device, all these things over\nhere get much more access to the heart,\n\n305\n00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.950\nto the internals of the device and\n\n306\n00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:06.790\nthe resources of the device\nthan this guy does.\n\n307\n00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:09.460\nThis guy,\nif I try to run these apps over here.\n\n308\n00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:13.750\nThis guy would sit there and\ndig its heels and say I'm not doing that.\n\n309\n00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.650\nAnd it would throw fits about it.\n\n310\n00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:17.800\nThis one may give me some warnings,\nnow and\n\n311\n00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.160\nthen, but it will go ahead and\nrun those things.\n\n312\n00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:26.290\nBut you can see that,\naside from me telling you that, and\n\n313\n00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.950\nsome of the tools that are installed\non there that will work on this one,\n\n314\n00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.280\nrather than this one,\nit really looks the same.\n\n315\n00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:36.670\nAnd that's a great thing when you get down\nto it, because, for a number of reasons,\n\n316\n00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:41.850\nfirst of all, when you look at\nthese two devices side by side.\n\n317\n00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:47.570\nOkay, fine,\nthe wallpaper is stock on there.\n\n318\n00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:49.960\nOr has been changed on these things.\n\n319\n00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.810\nSo I've got different wallpaper,\n\n320\n00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:54.580\nI may have apps installed here\nthat I don't have installed here.\n\n321\n00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.390\nBut someone looking at this thing\nas far as concealment goes,\n\n322\n00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.780\nthis is one of the big\nbenefits when you have this.\n\n323\n00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:03.020\nIs if you start an app on here,\nsomeone's gonna look at this thing and\n\n324\n00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.440\nsay oh well it's an Android\ndevice with some apps on it.\n\n325\n00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.900\nOkay whatever it's a tablet I've seen\nthose before and no big surprise.\n\n326\n00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.340\nThey both look the same in that one.\n\n327\n00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.370\nUnderneath the hood though like I said,\n\n328\n00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:19.150\nyou can do more with this one because it's\nunlocked and all that than this one can.\n\n329\n00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:23.030\nBut like I said I like the fact that as\nfar as getting around the interface and\n\n330\n00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:24.800\ndoing all the stuff with it.\n\n331\n00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.840\nIt's the exact same thing.\n\n332\n00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:31.550\nIt's just usage of the tools that's\ngoing to be the distinguishing factors.\n\n333\n00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:35.320\nAs the exact same thing,\nbecause they're both Android.\n\n334\n00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.940\nI could do it about on both of these, and\nyou may see different versions of Android,\n\n335\n00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.900\nthe build number is different,\nbut it's still Android.\n\n336\n00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:48.960\nSo that's just to kind of show you,\nsomething running Kali NeHunter with\n\n337\n00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.730\nall the trimmings, plus a few extra things\nadded on for, to keep it interesting.\n\n338\n00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:58.540\nAnd then you have over here,\nyou have a stock Android device.\n\n339\n00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.330\nLooks the same.\n\n340\n00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.510\nThe difference is between the backgrounds\nand the menus, by the way.\n\n341\n00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:05.120\nThat has to do with the Android version.\n\n342\n00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.430\nSo that's just a simple thing like that.\n\n343\n00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.160\nBut it looks the same and\nacts the same on it.\n\n344\n00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.130\nSo it's just to show you you're not\ngetting into something where, oh, great,\n\n345\n00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:14.370\nanother interface I've gotta learn,\n\n346\n00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.110\nanother product I gotta\nlearn with Kali Net Hunter.\n\n347\n00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:21.740\nWell, you know a lot of\nthe tools from using Kali, and\n\n348\n00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:26.350\nif you have an Android device or\nheck, if you're around iPads and\n\n349\n00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:32.970\niPhones all the time and you go to\nan Android device, you can still use that.\n\n350\n00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:37.170\nIt's not a crazy new Interface\nthat you gotta learn.\n\n351\n00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.690\nSo, that's just kind of give\nyou a peek at these two.\n\n352\n00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:44.730\nOur next step, though, is actually\ngetting everything on that device.\n\n353\n00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:49.280\n>> All right, Sean, well great look at,\na great comparison really,\n\n354\n00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.850\nside by side of the two guys.\n\n355\n00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:54.690\nI can already tell that I would be able to\nget around Nethunter without any problem.\n\n356\n00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:57.970\nNow of course, learning the tools and\nthat kind of thing, that's another step.\n\n357\n00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.250\nBut as far as functionality goes,\n\n358\n00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:03.950\npretty easy to step into if\nyou've owned any Android device.\n\n359\n00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:06.210\n>> Yeah, that's really the key thing here.\n\n360\n00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:11.420\nIs that you have a very\npowerful piece of technology,\n\n361\n00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:16.400\nsitting in your hands,\nthat you can do all sorts of stuff with.\n\n362\n00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.550\nBut you don't have to learn\nanother interface and\n\n363\n00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:23.850\nlearn how to reinvent the wheel,\nI mean think about when you stepped from\n\n364\n00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.180\na Windows device over to a Linux or\na Kali distribution on a PC.\n\n365\n00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:33.180\nYou had to learn, even though\n\n366\n00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:38.030\nthe interface looked familiar to you, and,\n\n367\n00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:41.060\nyou, kind of somewhat familiar to you,\ndepending on what version you went to,\n\n368\n00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.450\nyou could still, you know, learn it\npretty quickly, and get around it.\n\n369\n00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:47.310\nThat was a really cool thing,you know.\n\n370\n00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:51.360\nNow, what's hap, but,you still have\nlittle things that could pop out at you,\n\n371\n00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.330\nand be like, oh,\nnow I've got to learn how to to this.\n\n372\n00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:54.840\nI've got to learn how to\nuse the wireless here.\n\n373\n00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.910\nI've got to learn how to load\na driver here, or configure this.\n\n374\n00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:02.640\nYou don't only have to do that\nwith this stock Android device and\n\n375\n00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.830\na regular Kali device.\n\n376\n00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.280\nYeah, you can customise it and\ndo tweaks with it and\n\n377\n00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:11.980\nthere may be little things here and\nthere, but it's something that's so\n\n378\n00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.970\nsimilar, there are some\ndifferences to be sure.\n\n379\n00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:20.490\nI'm not going to lie to you and tell\nyou that there are none there, but that\n\n380\n00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:26.190\nthey are so close to being similar in the\nlook and behavior and the way things work.\n\n381\n00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:29.710\nThat you pretty much can go from a stock\nAndroid device over to a Kali NetHunter\n\n382\n00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:33.180\ndevice and be able to get around,\nconfigure stuff, and be ready to go.\n\n383\n00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:37.280\nAnd, like I said, that's also great\nfrom the standpoint of people on\n\n384\n00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.680\nthe outside looking at this thing,\nare not gonna really suspect anything.\n\n385\n00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.960\nAnd just to kind of give you\na little quick thing here.\n\n386\n00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:51.460\nWhen you look at this, my pen\n\n387\n00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:56.110\ntesting device I use, this one is,\nI wont be customizing or\n\n388\n00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:59.500\ndoing any tweaks with this one but,\nthis one I use in my work.\n\n389\n00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:03.590\nI went ahead and put the sleeve on it.\n\n390\n00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:08.210\nAnd me, sitting here, sitting on\na chair someplace in a waiting room,\n\n391\n00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:11.520\nsomething like that, reading this\nwhen I'm waiting for somebody or\n\n392\n00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.580\ndoing whateve.r It doesn't\nattract suspicion,\n\n393\n00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:19.450\nbecause it just looks like a tablet,\nbecause that's what it is, it's a tablet.\n\n394\n00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:24.850\nI could go ahead and load my Kindle\nreader on this, start my tools up, load\n\n395\n00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:28.690\nmy Kindle reader on here, and just start\nreading a book or something while I'm\n\n396\n00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:32.460\nsitting out there on a bench outside the\nbuilding I'm trying to get information on.\n\n397\n00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:37.090\nAnd someone goes, oh, well Someone's\nout there just enjoying the day and\n\n398\n00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:39.350\nreading a good book, I guess.\n\n399\n00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:40.330\nYeah.\nThat's what I'm doing.\n\n400\n00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:43.380\nBut I'm doing it while I'm passing the\ntime while it's reading all this stuff.\n\n401\n00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:47.520\nAnd as far as those adapters,\nthis is where, as far as the concealment,\n\n402\n00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.350\nall that goes as well.\n\n403\n00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:51.930\nYou may have noticed on here,\nI've got my velcro stuff.\n\n404\n00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:54.440\nI've got two adapters right here.\n\n405\n00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.500\nThis is very easy to conceal this stuff,\n\n406\n00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.560\nbecause now you've got it\nall sealed up like that.\n\n407\n00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.730\nYeah, there's a little bit of\nstuff sticking up in here, but\n\n408\n00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:06.168\nI could actually do a couple\nthings there to even hide that.\n\n409\n00:25:06.168 --> 00:25:09.820\nSo that's a huge benefit with this over,\n\n410\n00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.800\nanother huge benefit this\nhas over anything else.\n\n411\n00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.260\nIs it looks like a regular tablet, I can\nuse all the stuff that I would use with\n\n412\n00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:20.835\na regular tablet as far as covers and\ncases and hide the thing with no problem.\n\n413\n00:25:20.835 --> 00:25:22.385\nAll right, Sean,\na lot of great information.\n\n414\n00:25:22.385 --> 00:25:25.115\nGot us all excited about\ninstalling Kali NetHunter.\n\n415\n00:25:25.115 --> 00:25:26.115\nCan't wait to see that.\n\n416\n00:25:26.115 --> 00:25:29.685\nIf you guys can't wait either, make sure\nyou tune back in for future episodes, but\n\n417\n00:25:29.685 --> 00:25:30.935\nin this one, we're out of time.\n\n418\n00:25:30.935 --> 00:25:33.875\nSo signing off of ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n419\n00:25:33.875

00:00:16.850\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.430\nAnd Sean in this episode we're gonna be\ntakin a look at what it takes to get ready\n\n5\n00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.295\nto install Kali NetHunter on a Nexus 7.\n\n6\n00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:29.030\nCuz there are some things we've\ngotta do before we just dive in and\n\n7\n00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.970\nstart installing right Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.900\n>> Yeah as much as you just wanna get\non with it and get the process running.\n\n9\n00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.740\nYou do have to do some things\nbefore you're ever gonna\n\n10\n00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.166\nbe able to get to the point\nwhere you can actually get the-.\n\n11\n00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.340\nThey get Kali NetHunter on there.\n\n12\n00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.970\nBecause, first of all,\nif you don't do these things, you\n\n13\n00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.850\ncould actually have the point\nwhere the installation fails.\n\n14\n00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.410\nYou get caught in a boot loop\nwhere it just sits there and\n\n15\n00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.600\nlooks like it's booting, but it's not.\n\n16\n00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.320\nYou can actually brick the device.\n\n17\n00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.160\nThat's possible, or soft brick, but\n\n18\n00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.550\nmost of the times if you're gonna brick\na device, it's gonna be a soft brick.\n\n19\n00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.990\nSo when I say that just keep that in mind.\n\n20\n00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.850\nBut there's a number of things\nyou have to do before you can\n\n21\n00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.710\never get to the point where you\ncan get NetHunter on there.\n\n22\n00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.830\nBut watching these preparation things and\ngot all that stuff ready to go.\n\n23\n00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.810\nThen hey, you're in good shape.\n\n24\n00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.740\nSo, just keep this in mind.\n\n25\n00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.140\nThese are safety tips and\nthings to keep you out of trouble and\n\n26\n00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.645\nkeep you from having any serious\nproblems or frustration or any of that.\n\n27\n00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:39.980\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah really don't wanna\nturn in my Nexus 7 that I just got\n\n28\n00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.378\ninto a paper weight,\nor anything like that.\n\n29\n00:01:42.378 --> 00:01:44.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know?\n\n30\n00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.500\n>> Yeah, that's the big one.\n\n31\n00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.530\nLike I said, fortunately for\nthat, you can't say it enough.\n\n32\n00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.590\nIf you do research online, and you're\nlooking at creating an Android device for\n\n33\n00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.510\npenetration testing.\n\n34\n00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.115\nyou're gonna hear a lot of people saying,\nhey about using this word \"Brick a device,\n\n35\n00:02:01.115 --> 00:02:02.155\nbrick a device\".\n\n36\n00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:05.425\nAnd, you know, you've gotta be\na little more specific than that.\n\n37\n00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:06.545\nBecause it will freak you out.\n\n38\n00:02:06.545 --> 00:02:07.933\nYou're like \"Oh, I\"m gonna brick a device.\n\n39\n00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:09.325\nI don't wanna brick a device\".\n\n40\n00:02:09.325 --> 00:02:13.795\nJust like Mike said, you bought this brand\nnew device and oops, I just bricked it.\n\n41\n00:02:13.795 --> 00:02:20.125\nNo, yes you can brick it, but there's\ndifferent types of bricking, really, too.\n\n42\n00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:21.044\nThere's a hard brick.\n\n43\n00:02:21.044 --> 00:02:22.271\nAnd a soft-brick.\n\n44\n00:02:22.271 --> 00:02:26.230\nIf you soft-brick a device,\nyou can recover from that pretty easily.\n\n45\n00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.414\nWe have tools for that.\n\n46\n00:02:27.414 --> 00:02:32.400\nIf you hard-brick a device,\nit's becomes more difficult,\n\n47\n00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.410\nmuch more difficult in some cases.\n\n48\n00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.060\nBut there are times you\ncan get out of that, too.\n\n49\n00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.480\nThere are a few areas where if you\nbrick a device you might as well just\n\n50\n00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.150\nstart resting your drink on it at\nthat point cuz it ain't coming back.\n\n51\n00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.890\nBut fortunately If you're\ncareful you'll be in good shape.\n\n52\n00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:50.830\n>> So where do I start?\n\n53\n00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.690\nWhat's the first thing I need to do\nif I want to set up a Kali NetHunter?\n\n54\n00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.190\n>> First thing you wanna do is,\nI'm gonna be very clear about this,\n\n55\n00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.890\nyou're going to want to\nback up that device.\n\n56\n00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.610\nMake sure that you back up your stuff,\nyour data on there.\n\n57\n00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.800\nJust like if you were\ngonna do anything for\n\n58\n00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.020\nany of your other PCs or\nanything like that.\n\n59\n00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.260\nYou're gonna install a new operating\nsystem, you would back up that stuff.\n\n60\n00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.580\nSo make sure you do that\nbefore you really go anywhere.\n\n61\n00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.840\nNext thing you wanna do and\nIs part of the process.\n\n62\n00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.990\nIs make sire that if you're getting\nstuff from the Google Play store,\n\n63\n00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.120\nthe Google Play store has, your account\nhas a record of all those things,\n\n64\n00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.710\nthat's a cool thing, and I'll talk\nabout that more as we get into it.\n\n65\n00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.130\nBut Google Play can store a lot\nof your settings up there,\n\n66\n00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.400\nWiFi settings, It can store a record\nof what applications you had installed.\n\n67\n00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.050\nBut, the thing it doesn't\nstore is really your data.\n\n68\n00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.550\nSo, if you have files and\nstuff like that excluding\n\n69\n00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.880\nphotos in some cases cuz photos do\nget synchronized with both services.\n\n70\n00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.650\nBut not always, so always make sure, but\nget your vital data off of that, make\n\n71\n00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.730\nsure your apps that you have on there,\nmake sure you've got copies of those.\n\n72\n00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.940\nOr if they're synchronized to\nthe Google Play store that's been done\n\n73\n00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.830\nbefore you do that.\n\n74\n00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.000\nSo that's the big thing.\n\n75\n00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.639\nSo check that off the list.\n\n76\n00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.070\nNext thing you wanna do during this,\nor maybe I actually before,\n\n77\n00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.080\nyou'd wanna back it up,\ndepending on what your situation is.\n\n78\n00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.200\nYou back up the stuff if you already have\na device you've been using, saying, hey,\n\n79\n00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.250\nI've already got a Nexus 7.\n\n80\n00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.670\nI already have whatever.\n\n81\n00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:29.700\nI'm gonna use that.\n\n82\n00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.480\nWell, then back-up your stuff.\n\n83\n00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.330\nIf you don't have an existing device, and\n\n84\n00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.450\nyou went out and bought one used or\nbrand new or whatever.\n\n85\n00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.370\nYou may still wanna back up\nsome stuff off of it, but\n\n86\n00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.260\nit's probably not as much\nof an issue in that case.\n\n87\n00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.000\n>> When you say we can\nrecover from a soft brick,\n\n88\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.030\ndo we need a backup to be able to restore?\n\n89\n00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.910\nOr is that basically something\nwe could do without a backup?\n\n90\n00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.620\n>> Yes.\n\n91\n00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.470\n>> Okay.\n\n92\n00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:58.560\n>> It would be.\n\n93\n00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.110\n>> Worst case scenario I didn't back up\nmy stuff, I've stop, brick this thing.\n\n94\n00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.200\nI can reset it back to the defaults.\n\n95\n00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.440\n>> Yes, yes you can do that and we'll.\n\n96\n00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.690\n>> Of course I will have lost all my data.\n\n97\n00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.580\n>> Yeah you've lost all your data and\nthere's somethings that if you're not\n\n98\n00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.790\ncareful, just by hitting a button\nto do a simple operation,\n\n99\n00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.600\nwhat seems like a simple operation\nwill wipe your device so.\n\n100\n00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.820\nRemember that, be very very careful\nwhen you're doing this is-.\n\n101\n00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.680\nThat you got what you need off that\ndevice if there's anything there\n\n102\n00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.820\nprior to starting this whole process,\nbecause there's a lot we have to do.\n\n103\n00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.370\nAnd you will I'm not saying if you'll lose\ndata, I'm saying if it's on that device\n\n104\n00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.960\nand you're gonna go down that\nroute that we're going through.\n\n105\n00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.480\nYou will lose data.\n\n106\n00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.800\nOkay, if I could put that on the screen,\n\n107\n00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.510\nbig flashing red letters saying so you\nget it through your head I would do it.\n\n108\n00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.810\nBecause I've seen many people,\nwhere'd my data go?\n\n109\n00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.290\nDid you not see the part and\n\n110\n00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:58.050\nall the warnings that flashed on\nthe screen saying you will lose your data?\n\n111\n00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.480\nOkay, well, maybe apparently you didn't.\n\n112\n00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.060\n>> Danger Will Robinson [LAUGHS]\n>> [LAUGHS] Danger, yeah.\n\n113\n00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.478\nSo, you got that, but,\nif you don't have a device,\n\n114\n00:06:07.478 --> 00:06:10.240\nlike let's go back to that for\njust a moment.\n\n115\n00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.540\nIf you have an existing device, of course\nJim, make sure you back the stuff up.\n\n116\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.140\nNow, if you don't have a device and you're\ndeciding to enter this whole process.\n\n117\n00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.450\nThe question now becomes,\nwhat type of device do you wanna have.\n\n118\n00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.510\n>> Mm-hm\n>> And\n\n119\n00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.150\nthat's one of the very first\nquestions that you'll ask.\n\n120\n00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.980\nSo you don't have a Nexus device, you\ndon't have one of the supported devices.\n\n121\n00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.120\nOr you have one that you just\nreally don't want to monkey with,\n\n122\n00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.670\nwhich I completely understand.\n\n123\n00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.340\nNow what you wanna do\nis you wanna say okay,\n\n124\n00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.850\nI wanna have a device that I can you know\nplay around with, have it be my sandbox.\n\n125\n00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.450\nSo you've got a lot of options\nthere on the table for you.\n\n126\n00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.930\nSo what you would do is go to\nthe Kali NetHunter site and\n\n127\n00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.440\nwe showed that in a previous episode,\n\n128\n00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.670\ngo to the Kali NetHunter site and\nsee what hardware is there.\n\n129\n00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.760\nOkay.\nSo pick one,\n\n130\n00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.750\nlook at those devices,\nsee which one is ideal for you.\n\n131\n00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:08.460\nFor me I chose to go on\nthe route of my Nexus 7.\n\n132\n00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.100\nDevice just because it was the most\nversatile for what I wanted to do, a nice\n\n133\n00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.530\nsmall form factor they actually considered\na mini tablet worked nice for me.\n\n134\n00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.490\nIt's not the only that's\nsupported with this,\n\n135\n00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.140\nyou actually can get another type of\ndevice let me grab that back here.\n\n136\n00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.700\nI've got the other one\nI got Nexus five phone.\n\n137\n00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.090\nThese both could be used for this process.\n\n138\n00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.198\nIf you wanna do a phone,\nprocess is still the same.\n\n139\n00:07:33.198 --> 00:07:35.040\nI'm not gonna worry about\nshowing a phone for\n\n140\n00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.200\nwhat I'm doing here, because the stuff\nI can do on a tablet, I chose\n\n141\n00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.240\na tablet because it's easier to see\nthe screen here when we're doing demos.\n\n142\n00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.890\nJust makes it better for\nyou guys to see what's going on.\n\n143\n00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.280\nBut you can follow the same\nsteps I'm talking about here.\n\n144\n00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.650\nSo don't sweat it if wanna\nchoose one of these,\n\n145\n00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:56.650\nyou're like how do I get one of\nthese thing set up on a cell phone.\n\n146\n00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.830\nSame process, there's no difference.\n\n147\n00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.274\nBut you choose the device you want.\n\n148\n00:08:01.274 --> 00:08:05.012\nIf the seven inch tablet,\nwhich is a Nexus 7 is,\n\n149\n00:08:05.012 --> 00:08:08.037\nif this is too small of a screen for you.\n\n150\n00:08:08.037 --> 00:08:09.725\nThey support, what is it, a Nexus 10 now?\n\n151\n00:08:09.725 --> 00:08:11.335\n>> Nexus 10 with Manta Ray.\n\n152\n00:08:11.335 --> 00:08:13.510\n>> Yeah, they support that.\n\n153\n00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.170\nSo that one's got a little\nbit bigger screen on it, so\n\n154\n00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.405\nthat's pretty cool that they have that.\n\n155\n00:08:20.405 --> 00:08:22.625\nSo, you choose what you want.\n\n156\n00:08:22.625 --> 00:08:26.205\nKeep in mind if you're gonna do this,\nI probably more than likely,\n\n157\n00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:31.508\nwhen I do this sort of thing, your call\nentirely whatever your checkbook supports.\n\n158\n00:08:31.508 --> 00:08:32.031\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n159\n00:08:32.031 --> 00:08:33.790\nwhatever your budget overall supports.\n\n160\n00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.012\nWhatever your significant\nother will allow you to do.\n\n161\n00:08:37.012 --> 00:08:40.010\n>> Yes. [LAUGH] >> As the case may be.\n\n162\n00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:43.780\nChoose the appropriate device for you, and\n\n163\n00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:49.603\nI would say probably the best way to get\none is to either go on Amazon or Ebay.\n\n164\n00:08:49.603 --> 00:08:51.230\nAnd I'm not trying to\nendorse those services.\n\n165\n00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:56.930\nBut in the case of my two Nexus 7s here,\nmy Nexus 5s, got those all off of eBay,\n\n166\n00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:01.780\nwiped them, and went about\nthe process of what I'm doing here.\n\n167\n00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.580\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n168\n00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.970\nAnd you can get some pretty\ngood deals I think off there.\n\n169\n00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:11.888\nJust be careful if you're buying it used,\nthere's a point where hey,\n\n170\n00:09:11.888 --> 00:09:13.340\nit's too good to be true.\n\n171\n00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.930\nIt's definitely true on\nsomething like eBay,\n\n172\n00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.910\nthere's a lot of Nexus 7 devices\nout there that, hey Mike and\n\n173\n00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.340\nI were talking about here in the break,\nthere's one up there that was 20 bucks.\n\n174\n00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.580\nIt's like oh, it's a good deal.\n\n175\n00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.510\nYeah, it's got a cracked screen.\n\n176\n00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.313\nI bet it's worth $20.\n\n177\n00:09:25.313 --> 00:09:25.813\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n178\n00:09:25.813 --> 00:09:27.560\n>> In fact, that may be a little high.\n\n179\n00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.120\nSo choose the one you want.\n\n180\n00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.980\nWith, keep in mind towards stealthiness,\n\n181\n00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.590\ncases you may want to get for\nit to make it more stealthy.\n\n182\n00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.090\nPut it in your bag.\n\n183\n00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.271\nI love the Nexus 7.\n\n184\n00:09:41.271 --> 00:09:45.230\nI could even go to a Nexus 10 which\nwould still be a decent size.\n\n185\n00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:49.830\nI love it because I've got a mini backpack\nthat's almost like a messenger bag\n\n186\n00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:54.410\nthat I've got, and\nit's basically my go into war bag.\n\n187\n00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.490\nIt's got a couple of these tablets in it.\n\n188\n00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.340\nWell this is one of\nthe tablets that in it.\n\n189\n00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.680\nIt's got that plus a bunch\nof my other little toys.\n\n190\n00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.090\nThat's what I like is I can be fully\nequipped and think of how cool that is,\n\n191\n00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.920\nis that I can get a small\nbag of equipment,\n\n192\n00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:13.050\nof toys, that I could if I had a notebook,\nI could do this quite easily.\n\n193\n00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.070\nSo choose your device\nthat you want to use.\n\n194\n00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:20.003\n>> And Shawn, no difference functionally\nif I go with a Nexus 4, Nexus 5,\n\n195\n00:10:20.003 --> 00:10:22.920\nNexus 7, Nexus 10, One Plus One.\n\n196\n00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.130\nOnce I get Kali NetHunter installed,\nit doesn't really matter,\n\n197\n00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.360\nright, other than me being\ncomfortable with that form factor?\n\n198\n00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.890\n>> Yeah,\nthat's actually a really great point Mike.\n\n199\n00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:37.770\nIs that when you're setting these\nthings up, which device you choose\n\n200\n00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:43.420\nis not going to make a difference\non the features in there at all.\n\n201\n00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:49.620\nSo, it's just a question of which one\ndo you feel better about, which one has\n\n202\n00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.730\ngot the most screen real estate for you,\ndo you want something that's WiFi only.\n\n203\n00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.190\nThese Nexus 7s,\n\n204\n00:10:55.190 --> 00:11:00.040\nyou can get them with WiFi and with\nWiFi plus mobile if you wanna do that.\n\n205\n00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:05.180\nYou can get a simple WiFi mobile\ncellphone of course, you choose.\n\n206\n00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:10.470\nThat's what's really cool is that you\nget the same features on all of them,\n\n207\n00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.600\nwhat do you want?\n\n208\n00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.360\nYou choose.\n\n209\n00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.140\n>> This might be a silly question but\nif I go with a mobile\n\n210\n00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.020\nbecause I'm going to be using a WiFi\nadapter that's gonna plug into USB,\n\n211\n00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.990\nI don't really need that WiFi hardware or\ndo I if I wanna do WiFi stuff?\n\n212\n00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:28.150\n>> Great question, and the question would\nbe as it kind of depends on what type of\n\n213\n00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:33.350\nscanning that you're gonna be doing or\nwhat step in the process you're in.\n\n214\n00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:39.270\nIf you're just mapping at a wireless\nnetwork, then, hey, that maybe just fine.\n\n215\n00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:42.160\nYou don't necessarily\nneed that monitor mode.\n\n216\n00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.180\nIf you're gonna try to use\nthings like Kismet and\n\n217\n00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.360\nthose tools to intercept and\ndo packet injections, stuff like that,\n\n218\n00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.930\nyou ain't doing that with the one that's\nactually in these mobile devices.\n\n219\n00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:58.480\nSo at least any mobile\ndevice that has that,\n\n220\n00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.206\nwhich there is one that I talked about,\nit's the Nokia N900.\n\n221\n00:12:03.206 --> 00:12:07.740\nThat one is one that does support\nthat with a WiFi adapter, but then\n\n222\n00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.865\nagain it's not supported by Kali NetHunter\nso it doesn't really matter to you.\n\n223\n00:12:11.865 --> 00:12:14.390\nSo, or\nat least it's not on the supported list.\n\n224\n00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:18.390\nYou might be able to go down that road and\nfigure it out, but it's not on the least.\n\n225\n00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.350\nSo, therefore we're not,\n\n226\n00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.442\nwe're gonna consider it to be\na device that's not open to you.\n\n227\n00:12:21.442 --> 00:12:25.880\n>> All right, so we've decided\nwhat device we wanna go with,\n\n228\n00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.110\nwe picked our hardware there, it's on\nthe supported list, what comes next?\n\n229\n00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.740\n>> Well, after you go through this list,\n\n230\n00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:37.910\nwe do wanna take a careful look at\nthe system requirements and the hardware.\n\n231\n00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:42.610\nSystem requirements, those pretty\nmuch take care of themselves and\n\n232\n00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.560\nlet me talk about why that is.\n\n233\n00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.160\nAny one of these devices, like a Nexus 7,\n\n234\n00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.440\nthere's actually four\ndifferent models of that.\n\n235\n00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:56.650\nThere's the pre 2013 model, and\nthen there's the 2013 and after model.\n\n236\n00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.250\nBoth of them support WiFi and\nWiFi plus 3G.\n\n237\n00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.660\nOkay, so\nwe do have the Nexus 7 devices as we said.\n\n238\n00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.750\nWe also have other types\nof hardware out there too.\n\n239\n00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.590\nThe big thing, like I said,\n\n240\n00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:12.350\nis pay attention to which types\nof devices are useful to you,\n\n241\n00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:16.630\nwhich ones you want to have, and\nthen pay attention to system requirements.\n\n242\n00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.670\nOne of the things I was saying about the\nsystem requirements on the Nexus 7 is that\n\n243\n00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:24.500\nthere's four different models.\n\n244\n00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.840\nSome have mobile, some don't have mobile.\n\n245\n00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.380\nThere's also different\namounts of memory in there.\n\n246\n00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.120\nEvery device is gonna have that.\n\n247\n00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.620\nIt's gonna have different\namounts of memory in it.\n\n248\n00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.130\nIt's gonna have the potential to\nsupport SD cards in some cases,\n\n249\n00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.770\neven though that's rare\nwith the Nexus family.\n\n250\n00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:43.640\nThere's going to be ones from\ndifferent vendors potentially,\n\n251\n00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.910\nsometimes that happens.\n\n252\n00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:50.400\nSo pay attention to that part of it.\n\n253\n00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:55.030\nThe things I look for when I get\na device like I did with this Nexus 7,\n\n254\n00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:59.880\nis for my Nexus 7 I look to see\nwhat models were available and\n\n255\n00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.390\nthen I I took an eye towards well how\nmany gigs of memory does it have?\n\n256\n00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:10.130\nTurns out there's a 16 and 32 gig\nmemory model across the spectrum and\n\n257\n00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.390\nthen there's the WiFi and\nthe WiFi plus 3G model.\n\n258\n00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.260\nSame thing with the cellphones\ntoo is that they will have\n\n259\n00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.410\ndiffering amounts of system requirements.\n\n260\n00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.810\nThose system requirements\ncan impact you dramatically.\n\n261\n00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:27.500\nIf one of the things you have is,\nfor example, a 16 gig device,\n\n262\n00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.180\nthat is gonna limit you because\nyou have the operating system, and\n\n263\n00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.240\nit's gonna take up a chunk of that space.\n\n264\n00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:37.050\nAnd then you have whatever utilities, and\nthose utilities are gonna take up space.\n\n265\n00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:42.240\nSo I'd recommend, if you could spring for\nit, you can find one, get the 32 gig model\n\n266\n00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.670\nor get the most memory on whatever device\nyou choose, just go ahead and get that.\n\n267\n00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:49.270\nI'll leave the choice whether\nyou want to get a mobile or\n\n268\n00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:54.240\nnon mobile device, that's up to you,\nor non cell device,\n\n269\n00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:59.240\nup to you because you can get\nthose either way with the tablets.\n\n270\n00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.680\nThe phones, you're not getting a choice,\nthat's what it's designed to do so\n\n271\n00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.370\nobviously you're not gonna\nget that choice there.\n\n272\n00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:09.850\nBut not having enough memory is definitely\ngoing to impact you as far as what you can\n\n273\n00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:16.040\ninstall on there and other options which\nwe'll talk to as we get further into this.\n\n274\n00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.960\nSo pay close attention to that.\n\n275\n00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.900\nThe other thing to be aware of is\nif you look at some of the devices\n\n276\n00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:28.520\nthat look like the same model number,\nor they are the same model number, but\n\n277\n00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.370\nthey came after certain dates.\n\n278\n00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:36.290\nThat may dictate what the default\nversion of Android was on it which can\n\n279\n00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:40.090\nimpact what your starting point's gonna be\ncuz you may have to make modifications to\n\n280\n00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:45.360\nthat device to have the appropriate\nstarting point cuz some of the tools and\n\n281\n00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.460\nsome of the pin testing options don't\nrun on the latest version of Android.\n\n282\n00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.780\nSo, I want you to be aware of that.\n\n283\n00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.093\nSo, just some things to keep in mind.\n\n284\n00:15:54.093 --> 00:15:57.998\nWhatever you get, we know about\nthe backing up and everything,\n\n285\n00:15:57.998 --> 00:16:02.697\nbut something that I also want to impress\nupon you is when you get that device,\n\n286\n00:16:02.697 --> 00:16:05.902\nbefore you start any of\nthis installation process.\n\n287\n00:16:05.902 --> 00:16:09.718\nGo to your about section of\nyour options on your device,\n\n288\n00:16:09.718 --> 00:16:13.452\nand take note of all\nthe information that's in there,\n\n289\n00:16:13.452 --> 00:16:18.610\nbecause that's gonna come in critical\nlater on, if you have a problem.\n\n290\n00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.150\nYou're not gonna be like,\noh, what model was this?\n\n291\n00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.840\nWhat base band version was this?\n\n292\n00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.990\nThat's gonna be a headache.\n\n293\n00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:28.190\nYou can get around it, and\nit's not entirely difficult to get around,\n\n294\n00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:33.480\nbut it could be a rather\ntough thing to do.\n\n295\n00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.810\nAs far as, being able to look for\nthose things,\n\n296\n00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.408\nlet me show you just on a device here.\n\n297\n00:16:39.408 --> 00:16:42.764\nThis is my Android tablet here.\n\n298\n00:16:42.764 --> 00:16:47.740\nMy freshly made tablet, here.\n\n299\n00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.260\nI just opened up the settings.\n\n300\n00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:53.790\nYou click on this little gear icon,\nand as you go down the list in here,\n\n301\n00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:57.400\nyou'll see it has the about\ntablet down here at the bottom.\n\n302\n00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.860\nThe about tablet,\nall those things about kernel version, and\n\n303\n00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:05.740\nyou'll see build number and\nbase band version, all that in there.\n\n304\n00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.330\nYou're gonna wanna note that for\nyour device.\n\n305\n00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:11.071\nYou can see here's the version sitting\nthere, here's kernel information,\n\n306\n00:17:11.071 --> 00:17:13.100\nbuilt date, build number.\n\n307\n00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.900\nTake note of all those things,\nbecause those little codes and\n\n308\n00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:20.800\neverything could help you later on when\nyou're choosing, what to install on it.\n\n309\n00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.584\nThey ask you certain questions, so\nI just want you to be prepared for that.\n\n310\n00:17:24.584 --> 00:17:27.121\nThat does not get backed\nup during a normal backup,\n\n311\n00:17:27.121 --> 00:17:31.311\nthat's something that you're gonna have to\nget the old pen and paper out to do that,\n\n312\n00:17:31.311 --> 00:17:33.987\nor get your other mobile advice out,\ntake a picture.\n\n313\n00:17:33.987 --> 00:17:34.800\nWhatever you wanna do.\n\n314\n00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.709\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Stick it on\n\n315\n00:17:35.709 --> 00:17:36.888\nthe copying machine, I don't care.\n\n316\n00:17:36.888 --> 00:17:41.486\nSo that's just some FYIs on there.\n\n317\n00:17:41.486 --> 00:17:44.205\nYou can also, in here, by the way,\n\n318\n00:17:44.205 --> 00:17:49.923\nif you need to double check your system\nrequirements that you have in here,\n\n319\n00:17:49.923 --> 00:17:55.005\nyou've got the menu on these Android\ndevices do vary a little bit,\n\n320\n00:17:55.005 --> 00:17:58.586\nso you'll, typically, find the gear icon.\n\n321\n00:17:58.586 --> 00:18:03.341\nYou can click on up top, you'll find\nthe gear icon, you can click on up here\n\n322\n00:18:03.341 --> 00:18:08.705\nsomeplace, or you drag down, and\nit will show you all the system layout.\n\n323\n00:18:08.705 --> 00:18:11.540\nWhich you can look at is\nwhat options it has in here.\n\n324\n00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:16.120\nConfiguration options for the system,\nyou're using NFC capable stuff.\n\n325\n00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.710\nWhich may be another option\nthat you want to consider.\n\n326\n00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:20.460\nYou've got that.\n\n327\n00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:24.670\nYou can see different\nthings about storage,\n\n328\n00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.870\nin here how much space you're actually\nusing, data, stuff like that.\n\n329\n00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:32.600\nYou can get some knowledge of the system,\nbut you should know that before you go in.\n\n330\n00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.260\nAnd know what type of storage options\nyou have, and details about the system,\n\n331\n00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.700\nbecause that can help you for\ntroubleshooting, and all that.\n\n332\n00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.850\nSo that's just a look\nat the Android device,\n\n333\n00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:45.770\nand things we need to know ahead of time.\n\n334\n00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.920\nSo make sure you've got note of that,\nmake sure you're backing stuff up, and\n\n335\n00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.770\nyou've got your device all ready to go.\n\n336\n00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:55.760\nSo we're at a good point right now to\ngo ahead and really go through to get\n\n337\n00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:01.010\nthis process going, but before we let\nanything happen, there's something\n\n338\n00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:04.960\nthat we wanna do to make sure that we're\nprepped to get the install started.\n\n339\n00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.150\nRight now, you can see if I\ncan pull this up here a bit,\n\n340\n00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:11.880\nyou can see I got it plugged\ninto my PC down here.\n\n341\n00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.842\nIf I just plug it in like that, you're\ngonna do the Kali NetHunter install.\n\n342\n00:19:17.842 --> 00:19:22.594\nYou're gonna do that using\na micro USB cable, and\n\n343\n00:19:22.594 --> 00:19:25.885\nyou just plug it in to your device.\n\n344\n00:19:25.885 --> 00:19:31.199\nYou can use the same micro USB cable\nthat you're using to charge your device,\n\n345\n00:19:31.199 --> 00:19:33.450\nand do data transfers now.\n\n346\n00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:37.660\nSo that would be the device,\nI recommend that you use.\n\n347\n00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:43.190\nYou'll plug the thing in, and that's part\nof the process to getting it installed.\n\n348\n00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:47.940\nBut let me tell you what's gonna happen\nif you go to the Kali NetHunter site, and\n\n349\n00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:51.870\ndownload the Kali utility to install it,\ncause it has it's own utility.\n\n350\n00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.590\nIt's Windows based utility that\nyou can run to install this.\n\n351\n00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:57.780\nThere is a potential gotcha here,\nor not a potential,\n\n352\n00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:02.460\nit is a gotcha here, if you're not aware\nit, and they'll warn you about this.\n\n353\n00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.520\nWhen you plug this in.\n\n354\n00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.780\nSo I'm looking at,\nI'm looking at this device here.\n\n355\n00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.264\nYou're prepping for your install.\n\n356\n00:20:07.264 --> 00:20:10.560\nYou'll go ahead and\nyou click on that gear icon again, so\n\n357\n00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.810\nit brings up the menu\nthat we just looked at.\n\n358\n00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:16.520\nAs I scroll through this, and\nI go down to the about tablet,\n\n359\n00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.190\nI have to set this up, so\nI can transfer data back and forth.\n\n360\n00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:24.110\nRight now,\nat least do a transfer the information,\n\n361\n00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:25.650\nI need to transfer back and forth.\n\n362\n00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.086\nI can already transfer photos and\nstuff like that back and forth, and\n\n363\n00:20:28.086 --> 00:20:30.280\nother data back and forth on this,\nso that's not a problem.\n\n364\n00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.922\nAnd that's not what I'm\ntalking about though either.\n\n365\n00:20:31.922 --> 00:20:37.250\nI'm gonna be actually transferring OS into\nhere, so that's a little different story.\n\n366\n00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.289\nSo what you have to do is,\nyou have to enable,\n\n367\n00:20:39.289 --> 00:20:41.620\nfirst of all it's called developer mode.\n\n368\n00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.631\nOkay, now if you look\non the menus in here,\n\n369\n00:20:44.631 --> 00:20:48.440\nthere's no developer mode\nsitting up on this menu.\n\n370\n00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.290\nIf it's enabled, you'll see it under the\nsystems section, down towards the bottom.\n\n371\n00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:54.355\nIt ain't there, it's not enabled.\n\n372\n00:20:54.355 --> 00:20:56.470\nOkay, so let's go ahead and enable that.\n\n373\n00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:01.015\nThe way you enable that is,\nyou go down here to about tablet, and,\n\n374\n00:21:01.015 --> 00:21:04.888\nokay, well were just in about tablet,\nI don't see any switches, right?\n\n375\n00:21:04.888 --> 00:21:08.470\nThere's no switches, look,\nthere's a switch there,\n\n376\n00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:13.370\nit's just not really obvious,\nit's a little trick.\n\n377\n00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:15.270\nYou've got the build number in here.\n\n378\n00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:18.470\nIf you start tapping on it,\nnotice how if I tap on it,\n\n379\n00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.200\nit brings that little message up there.\n\n380\n00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.510\nIf you can't read it,\n\n381\n00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:25.630\nwhat it's saying is that as you tap on it,\nthe more you tap on it,\n\n382\n00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:30.610\nit'll start saying okay, this many taps\nto become a developer, this many taps.\n\n383\n00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:35.600\nIt'll keep ticking down until you\nget to a point where it says,\n\n384\n00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.860\nokay, you're a developer now.\n\n385\n00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:41.191\nSo, nothing changed here, what\nactually happened is I have over here,\n\n386\n00:21:41.191 --> 00:21:44.467\ndown at the bottom,\nI now have the developer options.\n\n387\n00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:46.361\nOkay, so now you'll click on that.\n\n388\n00:21:46.361 --> 00:21:52.219\nAnd what you have to do is, when you go\nthru this, you will go down this list,\n\n389\n00:21:52.219 --> 00:21:57.810\nand you will see that is has\nvarious options available to us.\n\n390\n00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:00.790\nWhen we start looking at this thing,\n\n391\n00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:04.340\nwe're looking at some stuff\nthat is very specific.\n\n392\n00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:08.300\nYou also, typically,\nbe called USB debugging.\n\n393\n00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:13.470\nThat's what it's called in the vast\nmajority of Android devices.\n\n394\n00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:17.930\nSo you're gonna see something saying,\ndebugging in there.\n\n395\n00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:20.318\nSo it says allow USB debugging?\n\n396\n00:22:20.318 --> 00:22:21.590\nYeah, we wanna to do that,\n\n397\n00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:27.140\nbecause we want to be able to transfer\nthis operating system from our PC,\n\n398\n00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:30.730\nover to this thing, and allow it to\nreboot and do all the stuff it needs to.\n\n399\n00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:33.650\nSo we're gonna say, yeah,\nlet's go ahead and do that.\n\n400\n00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:38.595\nSometimes it comes up with another\ndialogue, in here, not always.\n\n401\n00:22:38.595 --> 00:22:42.995\nIf I unplug it from my PC for\na second and plug it back in,\n\n402\n00:22:42.995 --> 00:22:46.174\nit may actually cause it to pop up here.\n\n403\n00:22:46.174 --> 00:22:50.179\nBut sometimes it'll pop up another\ndialogue saying, oh, by the way, do you\n\n404\n00:22:50.179 --> 00:22:55.370\nwanna preapprove this device to allow it\nto do anything it needs to in the future?\n\n405\n00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:57.570\nYou can choose to do that if it comes up,\njust hit okay,\n\n406\n00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:01.120\nit'll bring up some special code in there,\njust hit okay, and you're fine.\n\n407\n00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.070\nAfter you've gone through and\ncompleted everything, and\n\n408\n00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.620\nyou start installing another operating\nsystem on this, which Kali NetHunter is,\n\n409\n00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.880\nthat option will get turned off\nbecause it's in the operating system.\n\n410\n00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:16.199\nI recommend that unless you're gonna be\ndoing something like we're doing here,\n\n411\n00:23:16.199 --> 00:23:17.084\nthat stays off.\n\n412\n00:23:17.084 --> 00:23:21.721\nDon't leave that on,\nbecause that's a security risk.\n\n413\n00:23:21.721 --> 00:23:24.325\nOkay, so\nthat's the first thing you gotta do,\n\n414\n00:23:24.325 --> 00:23:27.190\nthere is another thing\nthat comes into play.\n\n415\n00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:32.530\nAs I swipe down from the top in here,\nI've got this plugged in as a USB device.\n\n416\n00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:35.720\nYou can see it says USB\ndebugging connected, so\n\n417\n00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.890\nthat's what the top dialog says.\n\n418\n00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:42.975\nThe bottom one over here says,\nconnected as a media device.\n\n419\n00:23:42.975 --> 00:23:45.448\nWell, if I tap on that it's telling me,\noh, yeah,\n\n420\n00:23:45.448 --> 00:23:47.099\nit is connected as a media device.\n\n421\n00:23:47.099 --> 00:23:54.203\nAnd what I'm looking for\nspecifically, it says MTP and PTP.\n\n422\n00:23:54.203 --> 00:23:57.275\nYou can't use this as a media device.\n\n423\n00:23:57.275 --> 00:24:01.317\nYou can't leave it in the media device\ntransfer mode to do what we're doing here.\n\n424\n00:24:01.317 --> 00:24:06.062\nIt has to be set up as a PTP device, so\nyou're gonna have to click over there and\n\n425\n00:24:06.062 --> 00:24:06.652\ndo that.\n\n426\n00:24:06.652 --> 00:24:10.260\nNow, it's on my computer right now.\n\n427\n00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.160\nWe don't need to take\na look at this right now.\n\n428\n00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.150\nAnd there's nothing really\nexciting happening here,\n\n429\n00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:19.000\nother than the fact that\nas soon as I click that on,\n\n430\n00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.310\nnow my computer's actually loading\nthe specific drivers for it in that mode.\n\n431\n00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:26.070\nAnd that's the next thing that will\nhelp us out because now we can\n\n432\n00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.050\nstart transferring data in there.\n\n433\n00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:33.060\nAt this point, you're actually in a spot\nwhere you can start getting ready to\n\n434\n00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.970\ninstall and\ngo to the next phase of this whole thing,\n\n435\n00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:39.630\nwhich is getting the thing ready\nto put Kali Nethunter on or\n\n436\n00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:43.499\njust putting Kali Nethunter on depending\non the state you're actually in.\n\n437\n00:24:43.499 --> 00:24:47.380\nSo, FYI, if your device,\n\n438\n00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:52.110\nsometimes there may be reasons why\nyou already put it in PTP mode,\n\n439\n00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:56.850\nif the system is still saying that,\noh, I can't transfer stuff over and\n\n440\n00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:58.770\nyou've got USB debugging enabled.\n\n441\n00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:01.170\nIf it still sits here and throws fits,\n\n442\n00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:05.990\nlook over here when you plug it\nin as a USB device, open that up,\n\n443\n00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:10.280\nthe USB connection up, and\nsee, well, is it on PTP?\n\n444\n00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:14.066\nIf that's the case already,\njust switch it to MTP and back to PTP.\n\n445\n00:25:14.066 --> 00:25:17.290\nIt's just kind of a way of quickly\nresetting the connection, and it will go,\n\n446\n00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:18.880\nokay, now I know what you're doing.\n\n447\n00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.605\nSometimes Android gets a little stupid in\nthat sense and you have to go through and\n\n448\n00:25:23.605 --> 00:25:27.670\nkind of give it a nice\nkick to get it to work.\n\n449\n00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:33.800\nOkay, so, we're in really good shape to\ngo through the next step of the process.\n\n450\n00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:39.510\nIf this is stock Android and\nyou haven't really done anything to it,\n\n451\n00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:44.640\nthen you can go right on in and start\ninitiating the Kali Nethunter install.\n\n452\n00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.930\nIf it's not a stock Android device or you\njust wanna go through and wipe it before.\n\n453\n00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:52.170\nMaybe you got it used and\nyou wanna wipe it before,\n\n454\n00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:56.090\nthere could be another step you do\nin here which we can take care of.\n\n455\n00:25:56.090 --> 00:26:01.160\nBut right now, we have a device that,\nall things excluded,\n\n456\n00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:06.370\nwould be something that I could actually\nuse to do my Kali Nethunter install.\n\n457\n00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:13.037\nSo remember, you gotta do these things\nas kind of the setup part on it.\n\n458\n00:26:13.037 --> 00:26:17.890\nAnd one other word of caution that I\nneed to kind of throw in here, and\n\n459\n00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.540\nI'd be very negligent if I didn't.\n\n460\n00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.640\nThis micro USB cable\nthat you're gonna use,\n\n461\n00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:29.220\nthat seems to be something that\ndoes cause people problems.\n\n462\n00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:36.320\nIf you plug your Android\ndevice into your PC and\n\n463\n00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.560\nyou try to start this process and it won't\nrecognize it no matter what you do with\n\n464\n00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.350\nthe settings we just talked about,\nit could be a case of that cable.\n\n465\n00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:49.220\nIf that cable's an after-market cable,\nsometimes those after-market cables,\n\n466\n00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.890\nthere's enough difference in them that\nit causes it not to be recognized.\n\n467\n00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:56.670\nIn which case you need to get the one\nthat actually shipped with the device or\n\n468\n00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:59.080\njust purchase another one\nthat comes from the vendor.\n\n469\n00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:03.250\nIt may be a little expensive,\nI know, but it's better than,\n\n470\n00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:05.455\nI'm saving you a lot of money here,\nso cough it up.\n\n471\n00:27:05.455 --> 00:27:08.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So make sure you use that.\n\n472\n00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:11.130\nThe other thing that could\npop in is the driver part.\n\n473\n00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:12.840\nThe driver should be plug and play.\n\n474\n00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.830\nAs soon as you switch over to PTP mode,\n\n475\n00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:19.840\nit should automatically do a plug and play\nand detect the drivers and load it in.\n\n476\n00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.510\nIf you don't have those things or\n\n477\n00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:24.740\nhave a problem, you'll have to\nload the driver's manual in.\n\n478\n00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:29.700\nI will show you how to do that when we're\ngetting ready to do the actual install.\n\n479\n00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.980\nSo everything's got a safety\nnet in here for you.\n\n480\n00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:35.640\nBut there are gotchas that\nyou do wanna be aware of.\n\n481\n00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.496\nBut right now, yeah, we've got\nan Android device that's ready for\n\n482\n00:27:39.496 --> 00:27:43.275\nits next phase in its\njourney to its new life.\n\n483\n00:27:43.275 --> 00:27:46.770\n>> [LAUGH] All right, Shawn, I'll tell\nyou, a lot of great information there.\n\n484\n00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:51.170\nWe are getting close to installing\nKali Nethunter, and let me just recap and\n\n485\n00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:52.830\nmake sure I didn't miss anything.\n\n486\n00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:55.810\nWe got the appropriate hardware,\nsupported hardware.\n\n487\n00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:57.210\nWe backed it up, right?\n\n488\n00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:58.540\nMade sure we had a good backup of it,\n\n489\n00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:02.000\nespecially any data,\nif we had any data on there.\n\n490\n00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.928\nThen we put it in developer mode.\n\n491\n00:28:03.928 --> 00:28:06.025\nWe've found our little\nsecret button in there and\n\n492\n00:28:06.025 --> 00:28:08.920\ntapped that guy seven times until\nwe went into developer mode.\n\n493\n00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:12.240\nAnd then we disabled MTP,\nswitched it into PTP mode,\n\n494\n00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.020\nwhich is gonna allow us\nto do that debugging.\n\n495\n00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.370\nIt doesn't see it as just a media thing\nwhere I'm just transferring things\n\n496\n00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:20.110\nlike songs and pictures to it.\n\n497\n00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:24.770\nAnd at that point, we're close to\nbeing ready to start this process.\n\n498\n00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:30.850\n>> Yeah, you're right there to\ndo the installation process or\n\n499\n00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:33.670\nmaybe one step removed from\ngetting Kali Nethunter.\n\n500\n00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:38.330\nKali can be the very next thing or there\ncould be another step in between that.\n\n501\n00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:42.640\nBut you're right there where you need\nto be to get the thing ready to go.\n\n502\n00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.810\nAnd we'll talk about that step that you\nneed to do cuz it's a significant step\n\n503\n00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:51.980\nthat you may have to do between\ninstallation of what we have now and\n\n504\n00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:53.510\nthe Kali Nethunter part.\n\n505\n00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:57.375\nIt's an important thing because not\nonly is it a way to help you get\n\n506\n00:28:57.375 --> 00:29:00.930\nthe device prepped for\nKali Nethunter just in case.\n\n507\n00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:04.380\nIt's also something that when you\ninevitably, and I'm not trying to put\n\n508\n00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:07.780\nanybody down, inevitably when you do this\nthe first couple times you're gonna start\n\n509\n00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:12.170\nfinding out how many four-letter\nwords you have in your vocabulary.\n\n510\n00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:16.180\nAnd if you have problems with that,\nI'm gonna show you a tool in here that can\n\n511\n00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:20.140\nbail you out, as well as get the device\nprepared if there's a problem.\n\n512\n00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:22.680\nAs well as if you wanna load\nother custom stuff to do that.\n\n513\n00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.600\nSo it's actually something that\nis kind of a new, exciting thing.\n\n514\n00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.390\nSo we'll get to that and be ready to go.\n\n515\n00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:28.540\nBut we're right there.\n\n516\n00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:32.820\nWe're either going at this point to the\nnext step, to install Kali Nethunter or\n\n517\n00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:37.100\nwe're going through and doing some other\npreps on the device in case it's needed.\n\n518\n00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:38.840\nAnd I'll talk about\nthat when we get to it.\n\n519\n00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.340\n>> All right, yeah,\ncuz unfortunately we're out of time.\n\n520\n00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:42.840\nSo we're gonna keep you\non the edge of your seat,\n\n521\n00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.200\nforce you to tune back in to\nsee how this process continues.\n\n522\n00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.550\nSo for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n523\n00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:50.570\n>> And I'm Shawn Oriano.\n\n524\n00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.685\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n525\n00:29:52.685 --> 00:29:57.780\n[NOISE]\n\n",

00:00:16.530\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.280\nAnd Sean,\nin this episode we're gonna continue on.\n\n5\n00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.890\nWe've been trying to install\nKali Nethunter on our Nexus 7.\n\n6\n00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.160\nWe went through the first phase of our\ninstallation process which was really\n\n7\n00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.810\nmaking sure we had everything ready.\n\n8\n00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.320\nWe got a device that's on\nthe supported list on Kali's web page.\n\n9\n00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.220\nWe've backed up all our information,\nwe put it in developer mode.\n\n10\n00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.603\nWe disabled the MTM, so we got that ready.\n\n11\n00:00:39.603 --> 00:00:41.889\nNow we're moving into what\nwe'll call phase two,\n\n12\n00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:43.598\nit's really just one process right.\n\n13\n00:00:43.598 --> 00:00:47.696\nBut phase two where we're gonna take some\nadditional steps to, I guess you were\n\n14\n00:00:47.696 --> 00:00:52.051\nsaying, to protect ourselves in the event\nthat something goes wrong down the line.\n\n15\n00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:55.722\nTo make it easier for us to recover,\nwhich is always a good thing.\n\n16\n00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:59.292\nWe're not counting on anything going\nwrong but, you know how computers are\n\n17\n00:00:59.292 --> 00:00:59.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.880\n>> So it's probably a good idea,\n\n19\n00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.580\nright Sean?\n\n20\n00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.240\n>> Yeah, it's not a bad idea to have this\nin your back pocket, both for preparatory\n\n21\n00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.270\npurposes cuz if you have this available\nyou can get the device ready for usage.\n\n22\n00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.840\nBut you also have something\nthat if you do have a problem\n\n23\n00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.430\nduring installation of NetHunter,\nthis is a way to get out of it.\n\n24\n00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.950\nSo it gives you some power there\nto help you do troubleshooting.\n\n25\n00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.741\nand get everything all ready and\nsquared away to go.\n\n26\n00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:33.976\nSo that is what we are going to look at,\nis just how to use this tool,\n\n27\n00:01:33.976 --> 00:01:39.300\nthe things it can offer you, and\njust go right on through it.\n\n28\n00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.110\nSo the tool that does this is something\ncalled the NRT, or Nexus Root Toolkit.\n\n29\n00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.850\nA quick Google search will find it for\nyou.\n\n30\n00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.280\nProbably the best site to look for\nit at is in,\n\n31\n00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.880\nI can't give you an exact link for it but\nthe website is the XDA Developers site.\n\n32\n00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.140\nYou can go up there and\nthey'll link you to it.\n\n33\n00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.690\nXDA Developers, that's a community board,\nit's also a good resource for\n\n34\n00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.970\nthis type of stuff, because they do a lot\nof stuff with Android and those devices.\n\n35\n00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.200\nBut they do have links to\nlittle helpful utilities,\n\n36\n00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.900\nstuff like that that can help you out.\n\n37\n00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:22.270\nSo, any case, what I have is this Nexus\nRoot Toolkit and I got it up on my screen.\n\n38\n00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:30.200\nWhat we have here is, I've got my\ndevice plugged in and ready to go.\n\n39\n00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.635\nAnd what I'm going to treat this as is,\neven though I know my computer has already\n\n40\n00:02:34.635 --> 00:02:38.303\nbeen set up to use the Nexis Root Toolkit\nand talk to these devices.\n\n41\n00:02:38.303 --> 00:02:42.072\nI'm gonna treat it as I'm\ncoming in cold on this and\n\n42\n00:02:42.072 --> 00:02:45.640\nI need to get the thing set up and\nready for use.\n\n43\n00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.960\nSo this would be the situation\nyou're coming in,\n\n44\n00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.490\nunless you happen to already\nhave the NRT on your system.\n\n45\n00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.695\nSo I've got, from the previous episode,\nstill got that good Android device\n\n46\n00:02:58.695 --> 00:03:04.540\nconnected and it's all been configured so\nwe're in good shape there.\n\n47\n00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.480\nSo I bring up the Nexus Root Toolkit,\n\n48\n00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.410\nI have the main console\nthere on the left hand side.\n\n49\n00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.290\nThat's where you're gonna\nbe doing most of your work.\n\n50\n00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.970\nOn the right hand side is just a console\nthat logs what's going on when you attach\n\n51\n00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.850\na device and everything to it.\n\n52\n00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.420\nSo I can see information\nthat it's got on file.\n\n53\n00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.660\nWhen you start this up, by the way, I\njust started it up for already obviously,\n\n54\n00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.490\nbut if you start this thing just from\n\n55\n00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.260\na scratch, it may very well\ntry to do some updates on it.\n\n56\n00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.490\nGo ahead and let it do it.\n\n57\n00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.443\nThere's no reason for me to sit here and\nlet you guys watch the thing update and\n\n58\n00:03:42.443 --> 00:03:43.600\na progress bar move across.\n\n59\n00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.450\nBut it may do that for you.\n\n60\n00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.840\nSo things you want to do,\n\n61\n00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.260\nfirst of all, you gotta be able\nto communicate with that device.\n\n62\n00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.520\nTo be able to communicate with the device,\n\n63\n00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.780\nit helps you out by having this\naptly named initial setup.\n\n64\n00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.034\nWhat you can do in here\nis you can use this and\n\n65\n00:04:01.034 --> 00:04:04.885\nit'll walk you through the steps\nof installing the drivers.\n\n66\n00:04:04.885 --> 00:04:07.350\nI happen to already have\nthe drivers installed, but\n\n67\n00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.355\nthis'll help you walk through\nthe whole process of it.\n\n68\n00:04:11.355 --> 00:04:14.150\nAnd it's very detailed about\ngetting the stuff ready.\n\n69\n00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.320\nAnd some of the stuff that\nwe already talked about,\n\n70\n00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.490\nit's already got that covered in here.\n\n71\n00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.890\nSo, the stuff like disabling MTP and\ngoing to PTP mode and\n\n72\n00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.810\nstuff like that, it's right there.\n\n73\n00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.260\nAnd also, I like this,\n\n74\n00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.100\nit even tells you which drivers are really\nthe best drivers for your situation.\n\n75\n00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.280\nIt's telling you oh, for your situation,\nwhen it detects your operating system and\n\n76\n00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.450\nall that,\nit's got the different solutions here.\n\n77\n00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.750\nIt's like hey, just use the Google drivers\nand say okay, yeah I wanna go ahead and\n\n78\n00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.610\ninstall those.\n\n79\n00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.885\nAnd it'll walk you through\nthe installation process, and\n\n80\n00:04:46.885 --> 00:04:52.916\ntake care of that, and you'll be\nready to use this Android device.\n\n81\n00:04:52.916 --> 00:04:55.990\nSo that's a really cool thing.\n\n82\n00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.210\nAnd it'll just walk you right through\nit and you can then do your test.\n\n83\n00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.860\nAnd it's gonna say, okay well, in your\ntest it says, ADB Device Connected.\n\n84\n00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.020\nAnd it's saying okay, it's gonna\nreboot my device as a quick test.\n\n85\n00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.013\nDon't worry about seeing that, don't\nworry about what's going on in the tab,\n\n86\n00:05:13.013 --> 00:05:17.680\nit just right now is going through and\nsaying, yeah, I can connect and\n\n87\n00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.460\ncommunicate with it.\n\n88\n00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.370\nWhat I'd wanna do is when it's doing this,\nI'd wanna glance over at my device and\n\n89\n00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.260\nsee is it actually rebooting?\n\n90\n00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.540\nYeah, I can see it shut off and come back\nto the startup screen and restart, and\n\n91\n00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.330\nindeed when I look over,\nthat's exactly what it's doing.\n\n92\n00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.640\nSo I'm good.\n\n93\n00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.830\nSo that means to me,\nwhen this is going through doing that,\n\n94\n00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.830\nI have a successful driver installation.\n\n95\n00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.700\nKeep in mind when you are doing this,\noccasionally there's problems with this.\n\n96\n00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:52.930\nI've had it happen where I've installed or\nplugged an Android device and\n\n97\n00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.920\nit just won't communicate with\nit no matter what it does.\n\n98\n00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.171\nAnd so what I have to do,\nis I have to either try a different cable,\n\n99\n00:06:01.171 --> 00:06:05.290\ntry a different port,\ntry reloading the drivers.\n\n100\n00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.379\nIt actually will tell you how\nto reinstall the drivers,\n\n101\n00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:12.340\nremove them, and then put them back in.\n\n102\n00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.640\nSo you can get a lot of kind of help here.\n\n103\n00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.700\nUsually you'll get it to\nwork without any problem.\n\n104\n00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.840\nSo, there you go.\n\n105\n00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.150\nJust one little FYI on that too\nwhile we're talking connectivity.\n\n106\n00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:32.620\nConnectivity is assured if you're using\nthis on a physical machine like this.\n\n107\n00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.614\nIf you're trying to do this through\nvirtualization, so you've got a Mac OS, or\n\n108\n00:06:36.614 --> 00:06:40.103\na Linux OS and you're trying to run\nWindows inside a virtual machine.\n\n109\n00:06:40.103 --> 00:06:42.408\nAnd then you're saying, oh well, VMware or\n\n110\n00:06:42.408 --> 00:06:46.010\nwhatever lets me connect to pass\nthrough to it, it isn't gonna work.\n\n111\n00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.120\nIt'll look like it's working, but\n\n112\n00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.520\nit very well could start choking on things\nand not working the way you expect it to.\n\n113\n00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.550\nSo just save yourself some frustration and\nsome pain and\n\n114\n00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.217\ngrab a physical machine and do this.\n\n115\n00:07:00.217 --> 00:07:07.495\nAnyway so it says Success onscreen,\ngreat, so you'd be happy at this point.\n\n116\n00:07:07.495 --> 00:07:11.683\nI close this, if you look over on\nmy little log window over there,\n\n117\n00:07:11.683 --> 00:07:16.424\nyou can see it's telling me hey,\nit recorded that it rebooted my device.\n\n118\n00:07:16.424 --> 00:07:20.770\nIt accessed fast boot mode,\nwhich is just a pre-boot screen,\n\n119\n00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.290\nlike a BIOS screen type thing.\n\n120\n00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.750\nAnd it's saying yeah, it did all\nthe stuff, it was successful, hey,\n\n121\n00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:26.750\nwe're in good shape.\n\n122\n00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.520\nThe driver's ready to go, so it's talking\nto this thing, so we really like that.\n\n123\n00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.150\nOkay, so, other things.\n\n124\n00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.780\nIf this is a stock Android device,\nwhen you go over here and\n\n125\n00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.290\nsee your model type,\nit should list it out.\n\n126\n00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.080\nIt should just go ahead and\n\n127\n00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.650\ntell you right there,\nthis is the model of Android you've got.\n\n128\n00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.500\nIf you're not sure, you can do this\nauto detect device and build, and\n\n129\n00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.370\nit will do just that.\n\n130\n00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.882\nIt will tell you this is the Android\ndevice you have, or you could\n\n131\n00:07:53.882 --> 00:07:58.321\nselect it off that list, and you can tell\nit what build of Android you're using.\n\n132\n00:07:58.321 --> 00:08:01.745\nYou can see all the versions of\nAndroid that are right there, so\n\n133\n00:08:01.745 --> 00:08:04.782\nyou could go all the way to 5.1 and\nPack one six is out,\n\n134\n00:08:04.782 --> 00:08:09.220\nyou can use this to load six on there,\nif it's supported for that device.\n\n135\n00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:15.480\nYou know so, but that's where, by the way\nnotice, when I go through that list,\n\n136\n00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:21.310\nit's a list of things in here and, notice\nthose little numbers at the end of it,\n\n137\n00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.970\nthose characters,\nit's got that six character sequence?\n\n138\n00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.350\nWell guess what that is?\n\n139\n00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.520\nThat's that information you wrote\ndown that I told you to write down\n\n140\n00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.060\nin the previous step, so\nhopefully you paid attention to that.\n\n141\n00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:37.967\nIf not, go rewatch that previous episode\na hundred times and write me an essay.\n\n142\n00:08:37.967 --> 00:08:39.603\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I went ahead and\n\n143\n00:08:39.603 --> 00:08:44.600\nby the way, just because it says\na certain number in the tablet.\n\n144\n00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:52.010\nOne of the tablets I have here is\nonly supposed to support up to 4.4.\n\n145\n00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.220\nI can put five on there no problem.\n\n146\n00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.779\nI can put six on there no problem.\n\n147\n00:08:56.779 --> 00:09:01.095\nBut I'm a professional and daredevil.\n\n148\n00:09:01.095 --> 00:09:05.100\n[LAUGH] In all honesty\nif you know your stuff,\n\n149\n00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.680\nyou feel a little more experienced and\nwanna be a little bit of a test pilot on\n\n150\n00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.810\nit, you can do that and\nprobably get away with it within reason.\n\n151\n00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.360\nBut, be prepared to have something\nlike this just in case you need to\n\n152\n00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.430\nbail out of that.\n\n153\n00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.469\nSo, I've selected the Build Force\njust to keep it nice and\n\n154\n00:09:21.469 --> 00:09:24.050\nsimple as a Nexus 7 tablet, which it is.\n\n155\n00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.430\nI selected the build number\nwhich is Android 4.4.4.\n\n156\n00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.800\nAnd I've got the code after it.\n\n157\n00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.350\nSo what things can you do with this?\n\n158\n00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.320\nNotice it has the ability\nto unlock your boot loader.\n\n159\n00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.140\nYour boot loader could be something\nthat's locked to a specific,\n\n160\n00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.260\nin the case of a phone or something,\nit could locked to a specific network.\n\n161\n00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:47.750\nSo be aware of that, you have to unlock\nyour boot loader which is response for\n\n162\n00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:51.490\ngetting the system and everything going,\nyou have to unlock that period.\n\n163\n00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.720\nThere's no ifs ands or buts about that.\n\n164\n00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.370\nIf it's not unlocked,\nthis process will fail.\n\n165\n00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:58.910\nPeriod.\n\n166\n00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:59.410\nEnd of sentence.\n\n167\n00:09:59.410 --> 00:09:59.960\nStop.\n\n168\n00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.800\nDo not pass go.\n\n169\n00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.650\nAll that.\n\n170\n00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.420\nSo you have to unlock it.\n\n171\n00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:07.350\nNotice also, notice in here that a nexus\nroot tool kit also gives you the same\n\n172\n00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.960\nwarning I was telling you\nto back up your stuff.\n\n173\n00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.010\nIt's saying if you click\non the unlock button,\n\n174\n00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:16.250\nit's says right underneath it, this will\nwipe your device, so make a backup first.\n\n175\n00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.690\nAnd it has a nice little arrow saying hey\nlook, there's a backup button over there,\n\n176\n00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:20.700\ngo use it, you know.\n\n177\n00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:25.290\nSo it will also you know help\nyou out to keep you out of\n\n178\n00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.850\ntrouble so, just be aware of these things.\n\n179\n00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.480\nThere is a reason for it.\n\n180\n00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.560\nUnlocking a boot loader will\nalways wipe that device,\n\n181\n00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.860\nit will treat it like it will unlock it,\nit will act like a brand new device.\n\n182\n00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.100\nIt won't know what's there.\n\n183\n00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.300\nWhen you get a brand new device and it\ntakes longer to start up the first time as\n\n184\n00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:47.000\nit's compiling everything and getting it\nready to go, it's going to even do that.\n\n185\n00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:52.310\nSo I can go over here, and\n\n186\n00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:58.020\nto get the thing ready, I could go ahead\nand just say unlock the boot loader.\n\n187\n00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:01.230\nWhich you know it happens to already be.\n\n188\n00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.110\nI can say, unlock it.\n\n189\n00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.820\nWhat I want to do is, just for\nkicks, I'm going to show you,\n\n190\n00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.630\nwhat you can do is do\nthe flash stock in unroot.\n\n191\n00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.915\nSo I'm going to turn this\nback to a completely clean,\n\n192\n00:11:11.915 --> 00:11:15.800\nout-of-the-box version of Android.\n\n193\n00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.240\nSo if I click that,\nit tells me right here.\n\n194\n00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.010\nOkay.\nWe'll click it.\n\n195\n00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.370\nIt will walk me through the process.\n\n196\n00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.840\nAnd that's what I'm going to\nultimately be using here.\n\n197\n00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.390\nBut notice under here,\nthis is the safety stuff in here.\n\n198\n00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.280\nSoft bricked or boot loop.\n\n199\n00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:29.930\nOh.\n\n200\n00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:31.390\nHeck.\nWell, bricked.\n\n201\n00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.420\nDid somebody say bricked?\n\n202\n00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.180\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n203\n00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:38.990\nThe system won't start up but\nyou can power the thing on.\n\n204\n00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:42.260\nIt will actually tell you the steps to,\nfirst of all,\n\n205\n00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.110\nto get the thing into what they call\nboot loader mode, that pre boot screen.\n\n206\n00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.517\nAnd then what you can do is it will say,\n\n207\n00:11:48.517 --> 00:11:53.412\nokay you clicked on soft brick boot loop\nand say flash the stock and unroot it,\n\n208\n00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:58.280\nand it will return it to the version\nthat you tell it to return it to.\n\n209\n00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.420\nYou know so if right now we'll\nreturn it to the Nexus seven version\n\n210\n00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.940\nrunning 4.4.4 of the OS, so\nit will roll it right back to that, so\n\n211\n00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.320\nagain you have written those numbers\ndown and everything off there,\n\n212\n00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.390\njust look at your paper and go click,\nclick,click and pop and walk away and\n\n213\n00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:20.710\nit will go ahead and restore it back to\nthat stock configuration, which is gonna\n\n214\n00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:26.340\nbe something that you're really, really\ngonna be happy about when that time comes.\n\n215\n00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:30.240\nBecause it will come as you get braver\nwith this and start playing around,\n\n216\n00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.200\nyou're gonna wanna start doing it.\n\n217\n00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.740\nJust some other things, and they're FYI,\nthey have this advanced utility saying\n\n218\n00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.860\nin the Nexus root toolkit which will\nalso help you with troubleshooting,\n\n219\n00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.250\ninformation about the device.\n\n220\n00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.620\nIt can go through and\nextract information off of that.\n\n221\n00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.650\nSo this one, it'll go ahead and\nsay, okay, well,\n\n222\n00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:50.170\nwhat can I find on this actual device?\n\n223\n00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.150\nAnd it will tell me, okay,\nthis is what it's gonna find.\n\n224\n00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:58.910\nSo right now it's gonna reboot the device\nand give me some information about it.\n\n225\n00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:05.210\nSaying okay, well it looks like it's\nstill doing a few things there,\n\n226\n00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:10.480\nbut it will tell me if\nthe device is still locked.\n\n227\n00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.560\nYou can see if it's been modified in any\nway, it will be able to pick that up.\n\n228\n00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:20.030\nIt's a great way to kind of keep\nyou aware of where you are.\n\n229\n00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:25.270\nOkay, so other things,\nI can reboot the system off of here,\n\n230\n00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.700\ngo back into the bootloader,\nyou know, whatever.\n\n231\n00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.960\nIf I say reboot the system,\nmy Android device will do exactly that.\n\n232\n00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.500\nYou know,\nwe can look over here right now and\n\n233\n00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.410\ngo, oh yeah, guess what,\nit actually did go ahead and reboot.\n\n234\n00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.900\nThen you can have stuff like\nwiping the caches in here and\n\n235\n00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.450\nyou will have to do that.\n\n236\n00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:47.450\nYou will have to wipe the caches on\nthe system and even in something else\n\n237\n00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:51.630\nto even note in here is that if you want,\nif you really get really brave and\n\n238\n00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:56.130\nwanna break outside doing Kali Net Hunter,\nand pad and all that stuff,\n\n239\n00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:01.130\nyou can easily go over here to\nwhere it says flash a zip file and\n\n240\n00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:06.200\nclick on it and download a custom rom\nwhich is an image of the operating system.\n\n241\n00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.140\nAnd you can use this to push a custom\none that's not stock Android onto it.\n\n242\n00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:14.430\nThis is designed out of the box to use\nstock Android, but you can easily say\n\n243\n00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:16.889\ngrab this rom file and put it on there and\nit will go ahead and put it on there.\n\n244\n00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:21.911\nVery, very quickly and easily instead of\nhaving to go through all those little\n\n245\n00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:26.210\nsteps that they put in other places, it's\nalready going to have that set up for you.\n\n246\n00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:26.868\n>> Nice.\n\n247\n00:14:26.868 --> 00:14:31.702\n>> All right, so we'll talk more about\nthis if, when the time comes, but\n\n248\n00:14:31.702 --> 00:14:36.296\nyou've seen what this is so\nlet's talk about the flashing stock and\n\n249\n00:14:36.296 --> 00:14:38.450\nunroot and what happens.\n\n250\n00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:39.961\nAs we click through the flash stock and\n\n251\n00:14:39.961 --> 00:14:44.800\nunroot, and what I really like about this\nproduct is that when you click on it,\n\n252\n00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.540\nit tells you, hey,\nthis is what it's gonna do.\n\n253\n00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.500\nBe aware of what's going on.\n\n254\n00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.970\nIt tells you these are the things that\nyou should do to prep the device but\n\n255\n00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:54.830\nyou can also click okay.\n\n256\n00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:58.190\nAnd it goes up and brings us up, saying,\nwhat do you want to install on this thing?\n\n257\n00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:04.140\nWell, I happened to already download the\nappropriate version of Android on here.\n\n258\n00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.750\nBut I could say, okay, 4.4.4.\n\n259\n00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:10.430\nAnd say, okay, well, I want 4.4.4.\n\n260\n00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:14.770\nClick okay down here and\n\n261\n00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:19.780\nit's going to if necessary in this case it\nmay take a moment or two it will download\n\n262\n00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:25.120\nthe appropriate one depending on\nwhich version you chose it may\n\n263\n00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:32.630\ntake a little time because these images\ncan be quite a, can be a substantial size.\n\n264\n00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:35.560\nAfter it downloads this it's gonna\ngo through the process of just\n\n265\n00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.290\ntaking care of it.\n\n266\n00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:37.660\nAt this point, I can just say, oh,\n\n267\n00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:41.400\nI'm gonna walk away and\nlet it take care of business.\n\n268\n00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.690\nAnd it can take some time.\n\n269\n00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:50.129\nYou can expect these installs sometimes,\naside from the downloading partm you\n\n270\n00:15:50.129 --> 00:15:55.487\ncan expect this thing to take sometimes\nmaybe 15 to 20 minutes sometimes,\n\n271\n00:15:55.487 --> 00:16:00.052\nthey usually say to schedule about\n30 minutes of time to do this.\n\n272\n00:16:00.052 --> 00:16:03.387\nI've had it less Than that, I've had it so\n\n273\n00:16:03.387 --> 00:16:07.380\nthey'd do it in a shorter\namount of time than that.\n\n274\n00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:11.839\nSo it just goes through and\ndoes it's whole job and\n\n275\n00:16:11.839 --> 00:16:16.096\nwipes the system,\nputs the new stuff on there.\n\n276\n00:16:16.096 --> 00:16:20.655\nAnd we should be in good shape at that\npoint to go in and either install Kali, or\n\n277\n00:16:20.655 --> 00:16:24.515\nwe could have a Kali NetHunter\ndevice that we're done using, and\n\n278\n00:16:24.515 --> 00:16:26.570\nwanna return to regular service.\n\n279\n00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:27.522\nSome people do that.\n\n280\n00:16:27.522 --> 00:16:32.350\nYou may decide that heck,\nKali supports a new version of\n\n281\n00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:36.020\nthe device so I'm gonna go get\nthe new version of the device.\n\n282\n00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:40.654\nAnd this tablet or cellphone or whatever,\nI'm going to give to the kids or\n\n283\n00:16:40.654 --> 00:16:43.585\nwhatever, and\nreturn it to service for that.\n\n284\n00:16:43.585 --> 00:16:48.680\nSo I'll just go in and\nuse this to reset the device to that.\n\n285\n00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.864\nAnd then put those apps on there and\nit's back to being a regular tablet.\n\n286\n00:16:52.864 --> 00:16:57.510\nYou can literally, as you see in\nthe interface, you can unroot a device.\n\n287\n00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:04.180\nSo, if you want,\nyou can re-lock the boot loader\n\n288\n00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:08.770\nand unroot it, so it's back to being\nthe stuff that you get from the factory.\n\n289\n00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:13.044\nSo you've got a regular Android device.\n\n290\n00:17:13.044 --> 00:17:14.703\n>> And we had talked the other day too,\n\n291\n00:17:14.703 --> 00:17:18.204\nthat it might be sometimes between jobs\nyou wanna go through this process.\n\n292\n00:17:18.204 --> 00:17:19.691\nWhere you've finished a job,\n\n293\n00:17:19.691 --> 00:17:23.340\nyou wanna wipe it from anything\nthat occurred during that job.\n\n294\n00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:24.990\nYou might use this same process?\n\n295\n00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:26.480\n>> Yeah, you indeed could use that.\n\n296\n00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.380\nYou could wipe the cache and everything\nclean on this device, and go right on\n\n297\n00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:36.385\nthrough and use this to install a brand\nnew clean installation of everything.\n\n298\n00:17:36.385 --> 00:17:41.250\nI mean it's not a bad idea to\ndo that anyway periodically.\n\n299\n00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:45.110\nBut after you work with a customer or\nsomething you may want to go and flash\n\n300\n00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:51.020\nthat device so it's all completely wiped\nclean and just set up and ready to go.\n\n301\n00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:54.430\nCool, it's just a really,\nreally quick and easy way to do this.\n\n302\n00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:58.073\nI like the fact that you can take a\nnotebook with this and plug in your micro\n\n303\n00:17:58.073 --> 00:18:02.403\nUSB cable, plug in your Android device,\nclick, click, click, it does its thing.\n\n304\n00:18:02.403 --> 00:18:07.020\nAnd then just walk away and\nlet it do whatever at that point.\n\n305\n00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.255\nIt's a very, very nice utility.\n\n306\n00:18:09.255 --> 00:18:14.604\nFYI, you can do the same type\nof stuff we're doing here,\n\n307\n00:18:14.604 --> 00:18:22.320\nreinstall Android on other devices,\nthis is designed for the Nexus devices.\n\n308\n00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.230\nIf you need to do it on another device,\ncuz some people might be watching this and\n\n309\n00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.250\nsaying, I wanna reset my Android device,\nbut\n\n310\n00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:32.442\nI don't want to reset it to\nwhatever came from the vendor.\n\n311\n00:18:32.442 --> 00:18:39.200\nI wanna reset it to a clean completely\nclean slate like the Nexus devices have.\n\n312\n00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:44.960\nYou can do that, but this isn't gonna work\nwith something like a Samsung device.\n\n313\n00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.995\nIf you have a Samsung device and you wanna\nturn that into a pen testing device,\n\n314\n00:18:48.995 --> 00:18:50.874\nyou actually can root that device.\n\n315\n00:18:50.874 --> 00:18:57.450\nAnd it won't be in the same league as\na Pwn Pad or a Kali Nethunter device.\n\n316\n00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:01.770\nYou can get it pretty close, and if you're\nreally ambitious you can meet it, but\n\n317\n00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.360\nit'll take some effort.\n\n318\n00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:07.347\nBut you can root it, and let's say you\nroot it and unlock the boot loader and\n\n319\n00:19:07.347 --> 00:19:08.691\nsomething bad happens.\n\n320\n00:19:08.691 --> 00:19:12.530\nAnd you're like oh, well heck,\nI can use this to restore those.\n\n321\n00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:17.303\nNo, those cases you might very well do a\npretty nasty version of a brick on those,\n\n322\n00:19:17.303 --> 00:19:22.380\nin which case you may be able to get out\nof that, but it's not gonna be as easy.\n\n323\n00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.990\nIn fact, with some of the Samsung devices,\n\n324\n00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:29.010\nthe newer ones have a security\nmodule on it called KNOX.\n\n325\n00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:34.590\nAnd if you tamper with the device it'll\nactually blow a fuse on the board,\n\n326\n00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.670\nthat won't stop the device from working,\nbut if Samsung looks at it,\n\n327\n00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:40.750\nthere's no way to reset that fuse.\n\n328\n00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.170\nSo they look at it and go,\nyou tampered the device,\n\n329\n00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:46.220\nyour warranty is void at this point.\n\n330\n00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:50.680\nSo you're either buying a new device or\nyou're paying the full price for\n\n331\n00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.980\nthem to fix it.\n\n332\n00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.890\nSo there could be little pitfalls there.\n\n333\n00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:59.341\nIn fact KNOX will even do other stuff to\nthe system too to block you from doing\n\n334\n00:19:59.341 --> 00:20:00.624\nstuff to the system.\n\n335\n00:20:00.624 --> 00:20:04.142\nIt's designed to keep you out of trouble,\nbut it can also be frustrating when those\n\n336\n00:20:04.142 --> 00:20:07.370\nthings that it thinks it's doing\nto keep you out of trouble.\n\n337\n00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:11.780\nIt's great if you are the average Joe and\nyou're using this device and\n\n338\n00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.520\ndon't know the technical stuff and\nall that.\n\n339\n00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.858\nBut if you're trying to\ndo technical stuff and\n\n340\n00:20:14.858 --> 00:20:17.033\nevery time you try to do something it's\nlike [SOUND] get your hands off that.\n\n341\n00:20:17.033 --> 00:20:18.522\n[SOUND] Get your hands off that.\n\n342\n00:20:18.522 --> 00:20:20.100\nIt can be really frustrating.\n\n343\n00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.940\nBut, in any case,\nif you have those devices,\n\n344\n00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:28.750\nyou will not fix those devices with this,\nthis is strictly for Nexus devices.\n\n345\n00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.110\nNever, ever forget that.\n\n346\n00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:33.340\nYou plug one of the other ones in and\ntry to force it to do those things,\n\n347\n00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.950\nit won't detect it because\nit doesn't recognize it.\n\n348\n00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.640\nIt's not build into the database and\nyou try to force the issue, and\n\n349\n00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:43.910\ntry to just shove it down its throat,\nyou can eventually get it to do it, but\n\n350\n00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.630\nit'll probably break that device.\n\n351\n00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:50.840\nAnd hopefully it's not irreparably\nbroken but there's no guarantees.\n\n352\n00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:55.141\nThe person that wrote this wrote it kind\nof as a free thing to help everybody out\n\n353\n00:20:55.141 --> 00:20:59.443\nso they didn't have to go through the old\nstyle process of loading things on SD\n\n354\n00:20:59.443 --> 00:21:01.317\ncards and all that type of stuff.\n\n355\n00:21:01.317 --> 00:21:04.202\nIt works really well for doing that.\n\n356\n00:21:04.202 --> 00:21:07.830\nAnd the fact that it also helps with\ntroubleshooting things like that is great.\n\n357\n00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.142\nI mean, this thing can help you if you're\nhaving problems loading another operating\n\n358\n00:21:11.142 --> 00:21:13.740\nsystem, something that\nvery well may happen.\n\n359\n00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:19.008\nYou load Kali NetHunter\non this Nexus 7 device?\n\n360\n00:21:19.008 --> 00:21:22.342\nLet's say I load it in there and\n\n361\n00:21:22.342 --> 00:21:27.093\nit's just not starting\nup like I want it to.\n\n362\n00:21:27.093 --> 00:21:31.490\nIt says it installed it, but\nit's not showing up on there.\n\n363\n00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.660\nI know it's there, but\nit's not booting it.\n\n364\n00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:38.090\nWell, you can use this device to\ndo what's called wiping the cache.\n\n365\n00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:41.228\nBecause when you start up\nan Android device the first time,\n\n366\n00:21:41.228 --> 00:21:43.436\nit actually takes the operating system.\n\n367\n00:21:43.436 --> 00:21:45.988\nAnd why it takes so long to start up\nthe first time is it takes that and\n\n368\n00:21:45.988 --> 00:21:47.710\ndoes kinda like it does with Java.\n\n369\n00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:51.148\nIt kind of takes the thing,\ncompiles it, and puts it in the cache.\n\n370\n00:21:51.148 --> 00:21:54.414\nSo it's gonna go to that cache to run it.\n\n371\n00:21:54.414 --> 00:21:57.680\nSo if Kali NetHunter hasn't been cached\nyet and there is something already there,\n\n372\n00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.380\nit may very well go to this cache,\nthe Dalvik-cache is what they call it.\n\n373\n00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:06.090\nThey call it something else now,\nbut it goes there.\n\n374\n00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.270\nAnd so if there is something in there,\n\n375\n00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:11.320\nthe device may boot into\nwhat it previously there.\n\n376\n00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.040\nWell, one of the ways\nyou can get that cache,\n\n377\n00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.764\nwhich also is called the user data cache,\nthe way to get rid of that cache is just\n\n378\n00:22:18.764 --> 00:22:21.985\nto go into something like\nthe Nexus Root Toolkit, and\n\n379\n00:22:21.985 --> 00:22:25.510\ngo into advanced utilities and\nsay, pop, you're dead.\n\n380\n00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:29.850\nAnd it will then reboot the device and\nall the sudden,\n\n381\n00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:34.100\nhey, everything's working great and\nyour happy.\n\n382\n00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.320\nSo it can help you out dramatically.\n\n383\n00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.546\nDo you need the Nexus Root Toolkit\nto wipe the cache?\n\n384\n00:22:38.546 --> 00:22:42.269\nNo, there's little button combinations\nyou can do when you power on the device.\n\n385\n00:22:42.269 --> 00:22:46.870\nBut this will make things just a lot\neasier for you at the end of the day.\n\n386\n00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:49.230\n>> Very good.\n\n387\n00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:50.760\nAll right well, Sean,\na lot of information.\n\n388\n00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:56.800\nAt this point our device is pretty close,\nright, to start installing Kali NetHunter?\n\n389\n00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.990\n>> Yeah, actually it's very,\nvery, very close to being that.\n\n390\n00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.890\nAt this point, we said in the previous\nepisode, if you didn't need to do this,\n\n391\n00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:06.990\nand had a stock Android device that\nyou just pulled out of the box, or\n\n392\n00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:12.120\nyou know for a fact is stock, then you\ncould have proceeded over this step and\n\n393\n00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.420\nright on into installing Kali NetHunter.\n\n394\n00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.000\nHowever, if you don't have\na stock Android device, or\n\n395\n00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.950\nyou want to take the extra step of\nwiping it and reinstalling stuff before\n\n396\n00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:27.440\nyou go through and you put pen testing\nstuff on there, then you could use this.\n\n397\n00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.550\nAnd then the third thing is that, if you\nhave that problem when you're installing\n\n398\n00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:36.430\nKali NetHunter, and something happens to\nfail, and there's all sorts of hiccups or\n\n399\n00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:40.900\nwhatever on there, this could be used\nto actually fix those problems too.\n\n400\n00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:46.060\nSo it's got multi purposes which is\nwhy it may not a necessary step for\n\n401\n00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.170\neveryone to do.\n\n402\n00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:50.325\nIt's a very helpful tool in the event\nthat you need troubleshooting,\n\n403\n00:23:50.325 --> 00:23:55.110\ncuz troubleshooting for an Android\ndevise can take some time to do.\n\n404\n00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:56.950\nEverything can be be right here.\n\n405\n00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:57.860\n>> Very good.\n\n406\n00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.350\nAll right, well you know what that means.\n\n407\n00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.850\nWe're out of time on this episode.\n\n408\n00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:04.160\nWe're gonna have to put off installing\nKali NetHunter to the next one.\n\n409\n00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.520\nSo make sure you come back and\ncheck us out.\n\n410\n00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.230\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n411\n00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:10.090\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n412\n00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:11.203\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n413\n00:24:11.203 --> 00:24:17.540\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:14.690\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.790\nWith me today is none other than Mr.\nSean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.780\nAnd in this episode Sean we're\ngonna be taking a look at\n\n6\n00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.660\ninstalling Kali NetHunter.\n\n7\n00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.140\nAnd you might think, well Mike\nhaven't you done that twice before?\n\n8\n00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.070\nWe have.\n\n9\n00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.520\nWe're on phase three of\nour install process.\n\n10\n00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.466\nRight, we've gone through quite\na few steps at this point.\n\n11\n00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.853\nTo make sure that we've\ngot everything we need.\n\n12\n00:00:34.853 --> 00:00:38.780\nAnd also to be able to recover in\nthe event that something goes wrong.\n\n13\n00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.580\nBut at this point we're about\nready to actually install, or\n\n14\n00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.090\nget that process started, right Sean?\n\n15\n00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.730\n>> Yes at this point we're ready to\nhit the button, the big red button,\n\n16\n00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.488\nto launch this thing and go for it.\n\n17\n00:00:51.488 --> 00:00:57.440\nSo, we are gonna do that and\nget the Kali NetHunter process going.\n\n18\n00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.980\nAnd it's surprisingly easy the prep work,\nand\n\n19\n00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.330\nall that may seem like this is\ngonna take quite a long time, but\n\n20\n00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.580\nwhat we're trying to do here is make\nsure all bases are covered for you.\n\n21\n00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.760\nHopefully it's not a when,\nit's an if situation,\n\n22\n00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.240\nbut just in case something does pop-up.\n\n23\n00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.780\nYou do, you've got tools now and you've\ngot an idea what the process looks like.\n\n24\n00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.100\nAnd you've got the particulars on it.\n\n25\n00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.040\nSo hopefully you can kind of\nextricate yourself from any types\n\n26\n00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.020\nof problems that might occur.\n\n27\n00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.360\nBecause you never know, you never know\nwhen fate decides to roll the dice and\n\n28\n00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.730\nget ya.\n\n29\n00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.170\nBut it's usually, I found out that\nthis Kali installation process.\n\n30\n00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.380\nAfter you've set up the USB debugging,\nand you've set it up with PTP.\n\n31\n00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.769\nYou can pretty much just rock and roll and\ngo right on from there and sail on.\n\n32\n00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.950\nWiping the device and\ngetting it back to stock notwithstanding.\n\n33\n00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.900\nYou don't necessarily have to do that.\n\n34\n00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.430\nYou usually can just, if you wanted to,\nyou could grab one of these tablets or\n\n35\n00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.938\nmobile phones out of the bag or\nbox it came in whatever.\n\n36\n00:02:05.938 --> 00:02:08.750\nPop the thing in,\nset those settings, and then.\n\n37\n00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.840\nAnd once the drivers are loaded\non your system, click, click,\n\n38\n00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.400\nclick, and let it go.\n\n39\n00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.270\nSo they've really made it easy,\nas you're gonna see,\n\n40\n00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.340\nto get Kali on there,\nfinally get Kali NetHunter on it.\n\n41\n00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.440\nWe're gonna go through the process.\n\n42\n00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.872\nNow, what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna show the process.\n\n43\n00:02:27.872 --> 00:02:30.380\nWe're gonna show the process here.\n\n44\n00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.480\nAnd kinda step through it and\ntalk about things that you\n\n45\n00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.172\nwanna make sure that you've done\nbefore you commit this installation.\n\n46\n00:02:37.172 --> 00:02:42.520\nJust as a quick review to make sure\nyour checklist is all filled out.\n\n47\n00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.590\nThen you can be ready to go through\nthe NetHunter installer and\n\n48\n00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.900\nlet the thing rock and\nroll and do its job.\n\n49\n00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.860\nSomething I want you to, just to be\naware of when you do this sort of thing.\n\n50\n00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.266\nIs when you do this,\ninstallation of NetHunter.\n\n51\n00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:00.530\nWe're gonna initiate it.\n\n52\n00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.390\nYou're gonna see it start to go,\nNetHunter start to go over.\n\n53\n00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.510\nAnd then we're gonna let you assume\nthat once we got to that point,\n\n54\n00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.760\neverything's ready to go.\n\n55\n00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.160\nBecause it does take around 30 minutes.\n\n56\n00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.630\nOnce it gets to the point of pushing\nNetHunter on the device it takes\n\n57\n00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.680\nabout 30 minutes for that to complete.\n\n58\n00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.250\nSo with that, with all the stuff\nwe're gonna be doing on top of that.\n\n59\n00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.210\nWe're not gonna worry about\nwanting you to see, hey look,\n\n60\n00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.470\nthere's a progress bar moving or\nthere's little colored stuff on screen.\n\n61\n00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.285\nNo, we're not gonna worry about that.\n\n62\n00:03:31.285 --> 00:03:35.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I guess we should take just a moment\n\n63\n00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.230\nor two to make sure that we've got\nall our I's dotted and T's crossed.\n\n64\n00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.750\nSo you don't have any unnecessary\nfrustration at this point.\n\n65\n00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.250\nWhat you wanna make sure\nyou've done is make sure that\n\n66\n00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.440\nyou got your data backed up.\n\n67\n00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.110\nOkay, so number one, if you have data on\nthere, make sure you got that backed up.\n\n68\n00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.100\nAnd you're happy with that,\nyou verified it.\n\n69\n00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.015\nMake sure you've enabled USB debugging.\n\n70\n00:04:01.015 --> 00:04:03.780\nSo go through and, like we said,\n\n71\n00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.200\ngo through your about tablet settings,\nand tap on the build number.\n\n72\n00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.370\nJust keep tapping on it, and\nit will eventually pop-up a little\n\n73\n00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.420\nbubble on there telling you, you got this\nmany more clicks or this many more taps.\n\n74\n00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.450\nThis many more taps, keep counting down\nand saying, you're a developer now.\n\n75\n00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.110\nAnd it will bless you or whatever,\nand you can go into settings and\n\n76\n00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.810\nthen enable USB debugging.\n\n77\n00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.000\nAnd at that point you\ncan connect the device.\n\n78\n00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.450\nAlso make sure that, and the only way\nyou'll see this option by the way is.\n\n79\n00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.650\nWhen you click,\nafter you've enabled USB debugging and\n\n80\n00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.540\nplug it in with your USB cable to your PC.\n\n81\n00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.900\nAt that point it's gonna,\n\n82\n00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.410\nyour device is will show up on\nscreen as USB device connected.\n\n83\n00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.330\nOr connected as USB device.\n\n84\n00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.864\nYou can just change that setting in there.\n\n85\n00:04:50.864 --> 00:04:52.800\nWhen you change that setting.\n\n86\n00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.430\nMake sure it defaults to MTP,\nchange it to PTP.\n\n87\n00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.190\nCuz this process will not work\nat all if MTP is enabled.\n\n88\n00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.610\nIt will, as soon as you try to\nstart it's gonna say can't do it.\n\n89\n00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.855\nAnd usually it'll tell\nyou go fix that setting.\n\n90\n00:05:07.855 --> 00:05:09.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so you have to go in there and\n\n91\n00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.480\nfix it will tell you specifically that.\n\n92\n00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.850\nSo if you missed it, you missed it but it\nwill tell you you missed it pretty loudly.\n\n93\n00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.750\nAnd then you go ahead and\ntake care of business at that point.\n\n94\n00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.630\nSo we'll go through those things.\n\n95\n00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.040\nNow when you're at that point and\nchecked that all out.\n\n96\n00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.738\nYou should be able to just,\nat that point, start up Kali.\n\n97\n00:05:33.738 --> 00:05:40.340\nThe Kali NetHunter Installer, and just\nlet things start to happen at that point.\n\n98\n00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.660\nIt should take care of\neverything there for you.\n\n99\n00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.950\nYou shouldn't need, unless you have one\nof the reasons that we talked about,\n\n100\n00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.870\nyou shouldn't need the Nexus root toolkit.\n\n101\n00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.840\nNow there is one little gotcha\nI want to put out there,\n\n102\n00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.090\nbecause I took care of it for\nyou here on the device that I have.\n\n103\n00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.410\nBut because it's not something that's\ngonna happen 100% of the time.\n\n104\n00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.500\nBut be aware that, sometimes when\nyou plug in these Nexus devices,\n\n105\n00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.260\nif they're an older version of\nthe Android operating system,\n\n106\n00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.680\nusually the 4 series of Android.\n\n107\n00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.195\nIf you're using in the 4 series,\nwhich they, what was that?\n\n108\n00:06:20.195 --> 00:06:25.210\nKitKat was the series that was a series of\nAndroid, that was, with the nickname that.\n\n109\n00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.850\nIf you use that one,\nit could very well could say.\n\n110\n00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.710\nThat a device is unauthorized.\n\n111\n00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.170\nAnd what it means is that\nit's gonna put the brakes on,\n\n112\n00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:36.160\neven though you've got USB debuggy\nenable all the other stuff.\n\n113\n00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.130\nIt may say nope.\n\n114\n00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.330\nNot doing this.\n\n115\n00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.035\nIf that happens and\nyou've checked everything else,\n\n116\n00:06:41.035 --> 00:06:45.770\nwhat you wanna do is unplug the device and\nplug it back in.\n\n117\n00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.190\nYou may wanna be in developer\nsettings when you do this.\n\n118\n00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.730\nBut you unplug it and\nplug it back in to a PC.\n\n119\n00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.440\nAnd what it will do is it will bring up\na dialogue saying allow USB debugging for\n\n120\n00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.390\nthis device, and it will bring up\nsome long strings of numbers or\n\n121\n00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.470\ncharacters rather kind of\nlooks like a MAC address.\n\n122\n00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.460\nIt's actually an RSA key.\n\n123\n00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.740\nAnd it's unique to that device and when\nit, and what it's saying is it's saying.\n\n124\n00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.700\nIf you recognize this\nconnection between these two.\n\n125\n00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.330\nHit okay and now it will authorize\nit as a valid connection.\n\n126\n00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.330\nIf you get that prompt in there, you're\ngonna have to go ahead and authorize it.\n\n127\n00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.650\nOtherwise you can remove\nthe authorization after you're done, but\n\n128\n00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.710\nyou'll have to do that to get\nthe process kicked off and going.\n\n129\n00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.140\n>> All right, good.\n\n130\n00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:36.250\n>> Yeah, so just FYI, five shouldn't\nnecessarily have that problem and\n\n131\n00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.287\nI don't know about six yet if it has\nthat same thing since it's still in\n\n132\n00:07:40.287 --> 00:07:44.828\ndevelopmental status, it's too early\nto say if yes it does or no it doesn't.\n\n133\n00:07:44.828 --> 00:07:49.586\nAll right, so, what I've got in my\nscreen to make this thing happen is,\n\n134\n00:07:49.586 --> 00:07:54.578\nsince we wanna get down to business here\nand install the Kali product is I have\n\n135\n00:07:54.578 --> 00:07:59.588\ndownloaded off of the Kali NetHunter site,\nthe Kali Net Hunter installer.\n\n136\n00:07:59.588 --> 00:08:01.213\nThe Kali NetHunter installer.\n\n137\n00:08:01.213 --> 00:08:03.767\nIf you install it from scratch.\n\n138\n00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:04.789\nI already had it installed.\n\n139\n00:08:04.789 --> 00:08:09.660\nI'd been using it because I do this stuff\nwith the Android devices all the time.\n\n140\n00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.500\nIf you install it cold,\nthe drivers should already be there\n\n141\n00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.630\nbecause when you do all\nthe stuff that I talked about,\n\n142\n00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:21.230\nit should already detect it and install\nthe appropriate drivers as necessary.\n\n143\n00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:22.970\nSo you should be good on that.\n\n144\n00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:26.720\nWhen you do install it,\nmake sure that you tell it to check for\n\n145\n00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.660\nupdates every time it starts.\n\n146\n00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.000\nBecause that way it'll make sure\nyou always have the latest version\n\n147\n00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.030\nof NetHunter available to you.\n\n148\n00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.070\nNo point installing an old version,\nyou know?\n\n149\n00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:40.340\nSo I just leave that option on there,\nsaying auto updates at start.\n\n150\n00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.790\nI just leave that.\n\n151\n00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:44.640\nAnd you can manually check for\nupdates, as you see in here.\n\n152\n00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.860\nOkay so, we're good with that.\n\n153\n00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.860\nSo that's the first grain of the wizard.\n\n154\n00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:53.280\nNotice it's not even like\nthe Nexus Root Toolkit.\n\n155\n00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.820\nNexus Root Toolkit,\nit's like mission control, man.\n\n156\n00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.970\nIt's got all these things in there\nthat you can do, which is great.\n\n157\n00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.510\nThere's a lot of options in there,\nand a tremendous amount of power.\n\n158\n00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:07.830\nIt's a godsend if you have a problem\nwith an Android Nexus device.\n\n159\n00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:10.030\nThis doesn't need it.\n\n160\n00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.910\nIt doesn't care, it doesn't need that.\n\n161\n00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.760\nSo, what you have here is,\n\n162\n00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.360\nit's gonna say okay well,\nstep one, what device do you have?\n\n163\n00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.980\nWell, you can see,\nit's the range of devices that it has.\n\n164\n00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.630\nI mean, look,\nit even has more devices listed here here,\n\n165\n00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.900\nthan what we had in\nthe Nexus Root Toolkit.\n\n166\n00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:33.900\nAnd some of you people have a favorite,\nthe one plus one is also codenamed Bacon,\n\n167\n00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:38.100\nso just in case you're keeping track here,\nif you like bacon.\n\n168\n00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:43.600\nSo anyway, it's a Nexus 7,\nit's a mobile tablet,\n\n169\n00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.110\nbut you notice how it has the four\nmodels of Nexus 7 I was talking about.\n\n170\n00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:52.800\nSo, we have the wi-fi, the mobile,\nand the 2013 wi-fi and mobile.\n\n171\n00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.640\nSo, we've got that as well as\nall the other ones that are on\n\n172\n00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.860\nthe Kali NetHunter site,\nthey're all listed here.\n\n173\n00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.570\nOkay?\nSo, I'm good with that.\n\n174\n00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:06.990\nI'm good with the selection I have cuz I\nknow that I have Nexus 7 mobile tablet.\n\n175\n00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.230\nThat's what we're saying,\nthat's what I've got.\n\n176\n00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:13.470\nWe're happy, we're good and\nnow time to move on to the next step.\n\n177\n00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.800\nNext step,\nit's gonna ask you about the driver stuff.\n\n178\n00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.641\nTechnically this driver stuff\nshould already be ready to go.\n\n179\n00:10:19.641 --> 00:10:24.118\nYou should be able to just say\ntest drivers and say okay,\n\n180\n00:10:24.118 --> 00:10:26.794\nand it says checking ADB status.\n\n181\n00:10:26.794 --> 00:10:30.779\nIt should be able to just call out to\nthe device and say device connected and\n\n182\n00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:34.845\ndo the quick reboot and everything on\nit to say does it respond to commands.\n\n183\n00:10:34.845 --> 00:10:37.676\nA reason why it checks the connectivity\nand then does the reboot,\n\n184\n00:10:37.676 --> 00:10:41.335\nbecause this thing is going to reboot that\ndevice right on the installing of this so,\n\n185\n00:10:41.335 --> 00:10:43.783\nit's gonna go though it,\ncan I make it reboot, great.\n\n186\n00:10:43.783 --> 00:10:47.880\nIt confirms that I can connect it\nwhen the operating system's up.\n\n187\n00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.190\nAnd I can connect it to what\nthey call fast boot mode,\n\n188\n00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:54.290\nthat pre-boot mode,\nit can connect into that one.\n\n189\n00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.240\nBecause it has to work with both of them.\n\n190\n00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:01.100\nWith the fast boot mode, it's gonna push\nall the images stuff onto the device\n\n191\n00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.000\nusing fast boot mode, it won't push\nthat through using the operating system.\n\n192\n00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.340\nSo it's checking to make sure it can talk\nto both of them, and everything's happy.\n\n193\n00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:14.950\nBut you should have the drivers\ninstalled at this point.\n\n194\n00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:17.850\nIf you don't have them then you can\nsee it has the option right there to\n\n195\n00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.665\ninstall the drivers for you, so\nit's got that covered for you.\n\n196\n00:11:20.665 --> 00:11:24.020\nSo it looks like that I'm in good shape so\n\n197\n00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:28.740\nfar because I can talk to it in both\nregular mode and fast boot mode.\n\n198\n00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.980\nAnd so it says device detected here.\n\n199\n00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.970\nReason why it took so long to say\ndevice connected the second time,\n\n200\n00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.420\nyou know cuz it said device connected\nthen it said rebooting device and\n\n201\n00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:41.290\nthen said device connected again and\nit said success, success now.\n\n202\n00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.970\nThe reason why it does that,\nis it had to wait for it to reboot again.\n\n203\n00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.340\nAnd so when it rebooted and here it got\nback up to the screen it took a second for\n\n204\n00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.450\nit to say, oh, okay yeah,\n\n205\n00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:54.260\nit rebooted success, it rebooted in the\nfast bit mode and when I reboot in fast\n\n206\n00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.840\nboot mode to get back into the regular\nmode, it did that successfully,too.\n\n207\n00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.360\nSo I can do what I need to\nto get this process rolling.\n\n208\n00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.770\nSo, I'm in a good shape there so far.\n\n209\n00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:10.230\nOkay, we walked through our wizard\nhere and hit Next, it's going to say,\n\n210\n00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.740\nwhat do you want to,\ndo you wanna install on this?\n\n211\n00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:17.150\nNow, this is where it gets a little\ninteresting, and be careful with it.\n\n212\n00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.920\nThis is why you wanna know your\nmodel number and all that again, and\n\n213\n00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.440\nmake sure you get that right,\nbecause you look at this down here.\n\n214\n00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.675\nFirst of all, up top you see see if\nthis is official, Kali NetHunter.\n\n215\n00:12:27.675 --> 00:12:32.895\nWell, of course, official Kali NetHunter,\nwonder what that is?\n\n216\n00:12:32.895 --> 00:12:34.965\nSo, but you can build your own,\n\n217\n00:12:34.965 --> 00:12:37.775\nyou can build your custom disk\ndrive just like you can with Kali.\n\n218\n00:12:37.775 --> 00:12:39.240\nYou can do that here.\n\n219\n00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.680\nI'm obviously just going to leave it\nas my official Kali Linux NetHunter\n\n220\n00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.200\ninstallation.\n\n221\n00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.840\nThe flash settings,\nthis is where if you're not careful,\n\n222\n00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.610\nyou can run into some hiccups here.\n\n223\n00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:57.300\nIf you look at this, notice how it says it\nhas Kit Kat, but it doesn't have Lollipop\n\n224\n00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.180\nunderneath it grade in Lollipop is\nversion five, Kitkat is version four.\n\n225\n00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.610\nI know what a lot of techies and\nall that think is that they're like,\n\n226\n00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.730\nI want the latest and greatest.\n\n227\n00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.000\nWell with the Nexus 7,\nthere's four versions of it.\n\n228\n00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.740\nThe 2013 ones will have Lollipop\nactivated as well, and you can choose.\n\n229\n00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:18.690\nBefore that it's gonna say I only\nhave KitKat available to you, right,\n\n230\n00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:23.640\nthat's the base system underneath that\nKali NetHunter sits on that I can run.\n\n231\n00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.230\nSo, if your option isn't available and\nyou know it should,\n\n232\n00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:33.600\nor you wanna take a chance, up to you,\nif you want to take a chance,\n\n233\n00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.790\nI have successfully loaded five on\nthis I'm not gonna do that here\n\n234\n00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:41.630\nduring this because I want to\ndo it just by the numbers here.\n\n235\n00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:44.540\nI don't want to be a test pilot for\nyou guys [LAUGH] right here,\n\n236\n00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.920\nI'll let you guys do that if you want.\n\n237\n00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.580\nBut I know in a good number\nof cases that that works.\n\n238\n00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:56.130\nSo, now what I'm going to do is,\nI will go ahead and click Next.\n\n239\n00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.530\nAnd you should see this all in green.\n\n240\n00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:03.839\nIt's either going to be green or\nred or some mixture of that.\n\n241\n00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:09.860\nSince I've done this before, this is all\ngreen because the files have already\n\n242\n00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.900\nbeen downloaded to this system and\nthey're ready to go.\n\n243\n00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.970\nIf they're not all there,\nyou're going to click the download and\n\n244\n00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:21.120\nupdate all of them, and it will go out and\ngrab all those things and\n\n245\n00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.870\npull them down and put them on the system.\n\n246\n00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:25.490\nThey have to be on the system bottom line.\n\n247\n00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:29.160\nSo, if you don't have them, you're\ngonna get them period, one of the two.\n\n248\n00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.870\nSo, I have them all and that's great.\n\n249\n00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:36.490\nSo, now I go through and\nclick Next and see what it's doing.\n\n250\n00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:38.220\nUnlock the device boot loader.\n\n251\n00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.339\nI happen to have the device boot\nloader already unlocked for us.\n\n252\n00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.628\nSo, we are in good shape there.\n\n253\n00:14:44.628 --> 00:14:49.399\nHowever, if you do say, unlock device\nboot loader, notice it's also giving you\n\n254\n00:14:49.399 --> 00:14:54.033\na warning here, saying, well this is gonna\nbe completely wiped and all that and\n\n255\n00:14:54.033 --> 00:14:58.252\nokay, well, if you're okay with that and\nyou backed up all your stuff,\n\n256\n00:14:58.252 --> 00:15:01.604\nlike you should have,\nyou go through and you click OK,.\n\n257\n00:15:01.604 --> 00:15:07.285\nAnd you just say, okay, well,\nI need to, I say go ahead and do it,\n\n258\n00:15:07.285 --> 00:15:13.910\nand it will check to see if the device\nhas actually been boot loader unlocked.\n\n259\n00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.610\nI don't think it's necessarily a bad thing\n\n260\n00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:20.900\nto check that to make sure the boot\nloader has been unlocked on it.\n\n261\n00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:25.840\nBecause it could be something that\ncould cause the installation to fail or\n\n262\n00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.535\nhave a hiccup.\n\n263\n00:15:26.535 --> 00:15:27.255\nNo one wants that.\n\n264\n00:15:27.255 --> 00:15:29.220\nNo one wants that at all.\n\n265\n00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.780\nSo make sure that you really truly\nknow that this is this way or\n\n266\n00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:38.000\nyou have to go through and set it up.\n\n267\n00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.942\nSo, I go through, I've set it,\nI went through and\n\n268\n00:15:41.942 --> 00:15:46.805\ndid the boot loader unlock and\nit comes back with a screen saying\n\n269\n00:15:46.805 --> 00:15:51.054\nokay the system's gonna take\na moment to boot back up.\n\n270\n00:15:51.054 --> 00:15:54.626\nCuz remember it did wipe\nthe device when it did that, and\n\n271\n00:15:54.626 --> 00:15:58.361\nis loading a base Gonna load\nthe base stuff in there again.\n\n272\n00:15:58.361 --> 00:16:01.164\nSo the boot loader's been unlocked,\n\n273\n00:16:01.164 --> 00:16:05.150\nmy system has actually come\nback online over here.\n\n274\n00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:07.800\nWhat should be able to happen now is,\n\n275\n00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:13.340\nif I were to go over here and\nhit OK, and go to the next step.\n\n276\n00:16:14.412 --> 00:16:19.020\nIt's gonna say, well,\nit's gonna flash a stock android.\n\n277\n00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.720\nWell, typically I would do this,\n\n278\n00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.460\nI would tell it to flash stock and\nandroid on this device.\n\n279\n00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:30.710\nI go over and look at it,\neverything is stock on this because I just\n\n280\n00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:34.400\ndid it from the previous episode,\nso I should be okay.\n\n281\n00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.478\nIf you're not sure,\nthen I would go ahead and\n\n282\n00:16:37.478 --> 00:16:43.399\ndo it typically since it doesn't take that\nlong, not of course, when we're taping.\n\n283\n00:16:43.399 --> 00:16:47.473\nWe don't want us to, we don't want like a\nseven hour episode or something like that.\n\n284\n00:16:47.473 --> 00:16:49.633\nNot that it would take that long, but\n\n285\n00:16:49.633 --> 00:16:54.172\nI won't do it here because it should be\nstock already because I just did that.\n\n286\n00:16:54.172 --> 00:16:58.187\nBut if you're not sure, or\njust if you wanna be like me and\n\n287\n00:16:58.187 --> 00:17:02.716\njust let it go ahead and\nflash the stock stuff on there, do that.\n\n288\n00:17:02.716 --> 00:17:06.396\nIf you're okay with the way it is,\nyou go ahead and you click Next.\n\n289\n00:17:06.396 --> 00:17:12.470\nIt's gonna say, hey I'm ready to\nflash Kali Linux to this device.\n\n290\n00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.850\nWhat you should be able to do is,\nyou can see there's no Next button.\n\n291\n00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:18.630\nThere's an Exit which will take\nyou right out of the wizard.\n\n292\n00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.289\nI'm just gonna say,\nFlash Kali Linux and root it and\n\n293\n00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:23.477\nit tells you this is what's gonna happen.\n\n294\n00:17:23.477 --> 00:17:30.833\nIf you commit to this install at this\npoint it's gonna wipe that baby clean and\n\n295\n00:17:30.833 --> 00:17:36.390\nput Kali NetHunter on it, and\nyou'll be off to the races.\n\n296\n00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.980\nSome of the stuff that's happening here,\njust so you know.\n\n297\n00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:43.540\nWhen you look at this dialog\nthat's coming up on screen, this,\n\n298\n00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.960\nobviously it tells us\nit's running a script.\n\n299\n00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:50.020\nBut let's talk about these steps so you\nknow what's actually happening there, or\n\n300\n00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.610\nget some background on this.\n\n301\n00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:54.820\nYes, it's putting Kali NetHunter,\nthe OS on there.\n\n302\n00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.580\nIt's gonna root the device as you can see,\nso\n\n303\n00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.670\nit's gonna give you that powerful,\nsuper user access to it.\n\n304\n00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:00.270\nSo that's great.\n\n305\n00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:00.880\nWe need that.\n\n306\n00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.870\nWe've talked about that.\n\n307\n00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:09.000\nBut the TWRP recovery and manager,\nthat's gonna be something that\n\n308\n00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:15.210\nAndroid already has a recovery mode where\nyou can click through just a really\n\n309\n00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:21.070\nsimple text menu, with the volume button\nyou can scroll up and down through it.\n\n310\n00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:24.530\nIt does the job,\nthat's about all you can say for\n\n311\n00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:29.459\nit because it's not pretty,\nit's very, very minimalistic.\n\n312\n00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.200\nAnd that's it,\n\n313\n00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:37.776\nif you want to have a little more power\nand flexibility, and be able to do some\n\n314\n00:18:37.776 --> 00:18:43.065\nother stuff then you can use one of these\ncustom recovery modules, and what it does.\n\n315\n00:18:43.065 --> 00:18:46.125\nIt takes the stock Android stuff and\nsupplements or\n\n316\n00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.935\nover writes it with its own.\n\n317\n00:18:47.935 --> 00:18:52.465\nSo this one actually has its nice,\nhas a nice graphical interface on it and\n\n318\n00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:58.922\nhas a set of like the six options\nthat the Android Recovery mode has.\n\n319\n00:18:58.922 --> 00:19:01.522\nIt probably has like 30 of\nthem in there that can do all\n\n320\n00:19:01.522 --> 00:19:05.582\nsorts of interesting things and format\nthe device in different ways and all that.\n\n321\n00:19:05.582 --> 00:19:08.430\nWhich is quite helpful,\nit really, really is.\n\n322\n00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.170\nBut I'll leave it up to\nyou which one you use.\n\n323\n00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.310\nThis is the one that comes\nwith Kali NetHunter.\n\n324\n00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.400\nIt's the officially supported one.\n\n325\n00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.620\nI would just leave that the way it is,\ndon't change it after the fact.\n\n326\n00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:26.103\nAnd then this busy box free,\nit says install this busy box software.\n\n327\n00:19:26.103 --> 00:19:30.547\nWhat that is, is that's basically a common\nexecutable or runtime that you've got, and\n\n328\n00:19:30.547 --> 00:19:34.517\ninstead of having all of your utilities\nbringing their own runtimes with them,\n\n329\n00:19:34.517 --> 00:19:37.674\nthis one consolidates a lot of\nthe core stuff that's in Linux.\n\n330\n00:19:37.674 --> 00:19:41.553\nInstead of having to start up multiple\ntimes and take up all that space,\n\n331\n00:19:41.553 --> 00:19:44.206\nit consolidates them into\nthis one package, and\n\n332\n00:19:44.206 --> 00:19:46.356\na lot of the common functions all that.\n\n333\n00:19:46.356 --> 00:19:50.196\nAll these utilities will be using that\nyou're gonna be installing as part of\n\n334\n00:19:50.196 --> 00:19:53.796\nthe NetHunter process as well as other\nones, they can call on this, and\n\n335\n00:19:53.796 --> 00:19:58.056\nit saves space, it's faster, and it just\nmakes for a much better running product.\n\n336\n00:19:58.056 --> 00:19:58.937\nSo that's what that is.\n\n337\n00:19:58.937 --> 00:20:03.567\nSo, in any case, we'll look at this and\nwe say that's fine,\n\n338\n00:20:03.567 --> 00:20:10.516\nwe're ready to continue, I click OK, and\nit's gonna say it's checking the status.\n\n339\n00:20:10.516 --> 00:20:14.040\nBy the way that,\nif I haven't mentioned already,\n\n340\n00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:17.430\nyou notice how it says\nthat checking ADB status?\n\n341\n00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:22.530\nADB is shorthand for\nsomething called Android debug bridge,\n\n342\n00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.870\nand that represents the actual\nconnection between,\n\n343\n00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:30.670\nit's a software it uses the connect\npoint A to point B between the two.\n\n344\n00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:34.795\nSo, it doesn't say Android debug bridge,\n\n345\n00:20:34.795 --> 00:20:38.550\ncuz it's that long, so it's just\ngonna go ahead and tell you that.\n\n346\n00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:44.840\nBut, anyway, so,\nyou can see it's starting the process.\n\n347\n00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:49.430\nIf you're watching this stuff and you\nsaw it flashed up there for a moment or\n\n348\n00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:52.510\ntwo that was pushing\na custom boot image to it.\n\n349\n00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.660\nAnd so it's taken care of that.\n\n350\n00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.080\nI can look over at my\nAndroid device here and\n\n351\n00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.480\nI can see that there's\nstuff happening on it.\n\n352\n00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:05.860\nThat it's doing the boot up process and\ndoing whatever it's business is, and\n\n353\n00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.370\nyou're gonna see onscreen, you're gonna\nsee that this things copying files and\n\n354\n00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:13.532\npushing files over and\ngetting the system already to go to do\n\n355\n00:21:13.532 --> 00:21:18.060\nits job,\nwhich is be a Kali NetHunter device.\n\n356\n00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:18.670\nAll we have to do,\n\n357\n00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:23.340\nI mean you can see on here right now, it's\npushing root files and Kali Linux device.\n\n358\n00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:28.820\nAnd pay attention to those last words and\nbrackets at the end, please be patient.\n\n359\n00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.960\nThis is not the time to sit there and\nwatch this device and\n\n360\n00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.533\ndrink coffee and all that other stuff,\nand drink power drink.\n\n361\n00:21:36.533 --> 00:21:37.297\nGo someplace else and\n\n362\n00:21:37.297 --> 00:21:41.850\ndo that while after this starts if you\nhave a problem with being patient, so\n\n363\n00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:46.450\nthis will take a while so it's gonna push\nall these different files over there.\n\n364\n00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:51.290\nIt may very well sit on this screen for\na substantial period of time and\n\n365\n00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:58.260\nlook like the system's locked up,\nleave it alone, give it time.\n\n366\n00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:02.410\nIt shouldn't never take more than\nan hour from what I've seen.\n\n367\n00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.566\nI've never even seen it take\nanything close to that.\n\n368\n00:22:04.566 --> 00:22:08.571\nI've seen it take just about a half hour,\naround that timeframe.\n\n369\n00:22:08.571 --> 00:22:12.521\nIn fact, I set up a Kali NetHunter\ndevice in here while we were\n\n370\n00:22:12.521 --> 00:22:17.065\ndoing one of our episodes it\nwas back here doing it's job.\n\n371\n00:22:17.065 --> 00:22:17.795\nI started it,\n\n372\n00:22:17.795 --> 00:22:21.685\nI started the process that you saw\nhere at the beginning of the episode.\n\n373\n00:22:21.685 --> 00:22:25.495\nWhen we finished the episode and\ndid the closing and everything on it,\n\n374\n00:22:25.495 --> 00:22:27.050\npicked it up, it was done.\n\n375\n00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:28.500\nYeah, it was that.\n\n376\n00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:33.670\nSo, expect a time frame like that and\n\n377\n00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:35.290\nusually if you're seeing\nanything that's good.\n\n378\n00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.620\nAny status information,\nthis you can see hasn't moved in a bit.\n\n379\n00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:42.230\nThis is actually stayed, so I'm pushing\nroot files and Kali Linux to your device,\n\n380\n00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.830\nit hasn't changed.\n\n381\n00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:44.940\nThere's no progress bar or anything.\n\n382\n00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.420\nYou can look on your Android devices.\n\n383\n00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.080\nSometimes you'll see it, there's\na progress bar or something moving.\n\n384\n00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.540\nAnd that will tell you that hey,\nthe thing's got a pulse.\n\n385\n00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:57.617\nBut, if you get to a point where it's\nlike two to three hours or whatever and\n\n386\n00:22:57.617 --> 00:23:02.371\nit's still not doing anything,\nthen I'd start to question, yeah,\n\n387\n00:23:02.371 --> 00:23:06.099\nas this thing just hung, or\nam I doing something else?\n\n388\n00:23:06.099 --> 00:23:09.820\nAt that point, if you do have a device\nthat's hung or something like that,\n\n389\n00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.064\none of the things that\nI've done to fix that,\n\n390\n00:23:12.064 --> 00:23:15.749\nif the device goes through a boot loop or\njust looks like I've got no life.\n\n391\n00:23:15.749 --> 00:23:20.011\nAnd I've waited what I think is more\nthan a reasonable amount of time then I\n\n392\n00:23:20.011 --> 00:23:24.272\nwill go over to the Nexus Root Toolkit,\nand push the stock stuff on there,\n\n393\n00:23:24.272 --> 00:23:27.770\nformat the caches on there,\npush the stock on there.\n\n394\n00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:32.710\nAnd go through that and\nthen go back here and try it again.\n\n395\n00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:36.480\nAnd usually, that's enough to give\nit a nice kick in the butt to move.\n\n396\n00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.250\nBut, just remember be patient.\n\n397\n00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.280\nLike the screen says be patient.\n\n398\n00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:45.130\nYou may not get any signs of life for\nawhile and all of a sudden, oh,\n\n399\n00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:48.770\nthere's some colors moving on the screen,\nand all of a sudden boom a Kali dragon\n\n400\n00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:54.520\ncomes up and you've got a Kali device and\nyou're ready to go.\n\n401\n00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:59.380\nEasy, easy, easy to do, I mean,\nso hopefully, while this is going\n\n402\n00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:04.770\nthrough we can just let that do it's job\nat this point, we don't need sit there and\n\n403\n00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:09.600\njust watch this thing do it's whole thing\ncuz there's nothing really there to watch.\n\n404\n00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.290\nWe could just stare at the screen and\ntrade war stories and\n\n405\n00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:14.530\nall that if we wanted.\n\n406\n00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:16.780\nBut no point in doing that.\n\n407\n00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:23.090\nAt this point if I'm you guys,\nI'd go ahead and let it do this.\n\n408\n00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:26.520\nGo do something else,\ngo take a restroom break,\n\n409\n00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.120\ngo hang out by the pool or whatever,\nand come back in a half hour and\n\n410\n00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.450\nyou should be have a device\nthat's ready to go.\n\n411\n00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:35.760\nWhat I will tell you to avoid is, yeah,\n\n412\n00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.860\nI know it's hard to pry people away from\ntheir computers and all that nowadays.\n\n413\n00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.265\nOh, I wanna get in and mess with stuff.\n\n414\n00:24:42.265 --> 00:24:43.340\nLeave it alone.\n\n415\n00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:47.560\nDon't open your web browser and your email\nand start poking around on that device.\n\n416\n00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:52.210\nYou'll probably be fine, but\nyou could possibly when your doing this\n\n417\n00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:55.090\nhave enough of a hiccup during one of\nthose other things that it could actually\n\n418\n00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:58.890\ndo something funky to that install,\nand now you're like great.\n\n419\n00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:00.450\nI knew I shouldn't have messed with that,\nso.\n\n420\n00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:01.740\n>> It's time to start all over.\n\n421\n00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.260\n>> Yeah, don't wanna start all over.\n\n422\n00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:07.460\nIt's not a long process but who wants\nto waste the time in doing it twice.\n\n423\n00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:08.710\n>> Absolutely.\n\n424\n00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:10.970\nAll right, well Shawn,\nanother great episode.\n\n425\n00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:15.010\nWe know have Kali NetHunter\ninstalled on our Nexus 7 device,\n\n426\n00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:19.260\nso we're gonna take a look at what it\nlooks like once it's installed and\n\n427\n00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:20.980\nthe kinda things we can do with it.\n\n428\n00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.310\nBut unfortunately,\nwe're out of time for this episode, so\n\n429\n00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:26.170\nwe'll have to get that\nin the next episode.\n\n430\n00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:29.360\nSo for now, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n431\n00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.265\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n432\n00:25:30.265 --> 00:25:31.508\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n433\n00:25:31.508 --> 00:25:35.861\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.140\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.880\nAnd Sean, in this episode we're\ngonna be taking a look at\n\n5\n00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.090\nour installation of Kali NetHunter.\n\n6\n00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.350\nHopefully we've successfully\ninstalled it at this point.\n\n7\n00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.570\nWe've gone through several episodes\nwhere we talked about the pre reqs,\n\n8\n00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.860\nwe've gone through the process\nto get everything ready.\n\n9\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.290\nWe've gone through the process\nof making sure we get\n\n10\n00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.810\nrolled back if we soft brick the device.\n\n11\n00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.600\nThen we went through the process\nof actually installing it.\n\n12\n00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.010\nNow we're gonna take a look at what it\nlooks like when the installation finishes\n\n13\n00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.790\nand some of the things we've gotta\ndo before we start using the device,\n\n14\n00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.680\nright Sean?\n\n15\n00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.050\n>> Yes, the device,\nyou can actually use it out of the box.\n\n16\n00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.280\nAfter you get everything installed,\nyou can can start using it.\n\n17\n00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.430\nIt's a question of what things should\nyou consider doing or might need to do\n\n18\n00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.770\nafter you've got everything installed,\nbecause there are some things that\n\n19\n00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.470\nare just kind of like, well while you can\nuse the device, you're gonna want to do\n\n20\n00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.250\nthese things just to make things a little\nbetter, and get the experience better.\n\n21\n00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.120\nSo what I'm gonna do is talk those\nthings to make sure you're okay.\n\n22\n00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.420\nFirst of all, as far as post setup things,\n\n23\n00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.925\none of the things you're going to have\nto do, and I'll show on my tablet here,\n\n24\n00:01:26.925 --> 00:01:32.690\ncuz I have Kali already completed and\ninstalled on it.\n\n25\n00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.570\nIt's all ready to go.\n\n26\n00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.100\nSo we're all happy.\n\n27\n00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.355\nNow, one of the things that I've got,\nthat I have already done, and\n\n28\n00:01:41.355 --> 00:01:47.390\nthat's bringing this stuff up here,\nis it has my Google account linked to it,\n\n29\n00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.722\nmy Google Play account.\n\n30\n00:01:49.722 --> 00:01:57.890\nBy default, what's gonna happen is,\nwhen you load this up,\n\n31\n00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.560\nit's gonna say not everything's working\nwithout your Gmail account ready to go, so\n\n32\n00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.190\nI will configure my Gmail account on here,\n\n33\n00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.690\nand it will bring up some extra stuff.\n\n34\n00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.350\nYou don't necessarily need to do that, but\nif you wanna load additional utilities out\n\n35\n00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.150\nof the Google Play Store or whatever,\nyou're gonna need to get that moving.\n\n36\n00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.320\nOkay, so I've already done that for you\nwith my account, so we're in good shape.\n\n37\n00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.330\n>> No, wait we didn't get to\nsee you put in your password.\n\n38\n00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.540\nCan we do that again?\n\n39\n00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.695\n>> Yeah, just trace the fingerprints.\n\n40\n00:02:28.695 --> 00:02:36.270\n>> [LAUGH]\nSo, I've got that done, so\n\n41\n00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.220\nwe're in good shape there as far as kinda\npoking around, it's still a clean device.\n\n42\n00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.560\nThere's really nothing there,\nother than the default stuff.\n\n43\n00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.720\nYou can see we have some of\nthe Kali NetHunter stuff on here,\n\n44\n00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.050\nyou can see that we have\nsome Android VNC stuff here,\n\n45\n00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.110\nthere's some Bluetooth stuff,\nthere's BusyBox.\n\n46\n00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.340\nSo it does have some stuff\nalready installed on here,\n\n47\n00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.700\nwhich is good for us to have that.\n\n48\n00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.460\nAs far as doing updates and\nstuff like that,\n\n49\n00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.080\nwe haven't done any updates,\nnothing's being downloaded right now.\n\n50\n00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:26.330\nYou will notice that it has already said\nthat it has system updates available.\n\n51\n00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.100\nWe can go ahead and complete that.\n\n52\n00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.250\nI'm not gonna worry about completing\nthat here, so I'll just go ahead and\n\n53\n00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.580\nsay okay we're in good shape.\n\n54\n00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.720\nOkay, so things you are gonna want to\nthink about doing at this point is,\n\n55\n00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.075\nfor example, you're gonna have\nGoogle Play sitting over here,\n\n56\n00:03:46.075 --> 00:03:52.490\nis going to Google Play and\ngoing through and\n\n57\n00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.460\ngetting your actual\nsoftware installed on here.\n\n58\n00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.020\nNot everything is gonna\ncome with Kali NetHunter.\n\n59\n00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.540\nSo you're going to need to install stuff.\n\n60\n00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.260\nI know people like doing stuff like\nFing and other things like that.\n\n61\n00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.560\nOne that I like putting in here if I can\n\n62\n00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:21.690\ndo this, looking at a weird angle here is,\nthis Titanium Backup.\n\n63\n00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.600\nThis Titanium Backup, I think it's really\nkind of a great thing, and let me kind of\n\n64\n00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.660\ntake the brightness down a bit on here so\nyou can see it a bit better.\n\n65\n00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.110\nLet's see, did I hit the wrong thing here?\n\n66\n00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.920\nActually, let me go back to, there we go.\n\n67\n00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.995\nSo, I don't have my glasses on people,\nokay?\n\n68\n00:04:44.995 --> 00:04:48.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Gotta get my prescription.\n\n69\n00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.870\nOh, there it is.\n\n70\n00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.820\nSo I'll bring that down just a bit there,\nhopefully that makes it easier for\n\n71\n00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.906\nyou folks watching to read.\n\n72\n00:04:59.906 --> 00:05:05.420\n>> Maybe a hair darker [LAUGH]\n>> Hey I\n\n73\n00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.659\ntold her it was a secure operating system,\nall right.\n\n74\n00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that's a little better.\n\n75\n00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.820\nSo I will go over here back\nto my Google Play Store.\n\n76\n00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.060\nHopefully that's gonna be readable.\n\n77\n00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:28.010\nIt's still bringing that up right now,\nso, but the Titanium Backup\n\n78\n00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.368\nthat we have,\nlet me just type that in here.\n\n79\n00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.410\nThe Titanium Backup, the reason\nwhy I mentioned this one as being\n\n80\n00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.400\na good thing to have in there is that\nyou can use it to freeze applications.\n\n81\n00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.650\nYou can use it literally to back\nup settings and stuff like that.\n\n82\n00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.890\nAnd I guarantee with all the monkeying\naround on this, you're gonna wanna\n\n83\n00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.570\njust have something like this to\nmake things a lot easier on you.\n\n84\n00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.130\nThat would be a big, big thing to have.\n\n85\n00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.660\nSo you might want to consider doing that.\n\n86\n00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.730\nThere is a free version.\n\n87\n00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.630\nThere's also a pro version.\n\n88\n00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.690\nThis happens to be the free version.\n\n89\n00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.480\nThe free version is pretty\ncapable with what it has.\n\n90\n00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.730\nThere's also stuff you can use in here.\n\n91\n00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.720\nThere's optimizers you\nmight want to install.\n\n92\n00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.540\nYou can go to the Google Google Play\nstore, they have optimizers that you can\n\n93\n00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:26.030\nuse to adjust the performance and the\nbattery settings and all that on there.\n\n94\n00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:31.760\nSo you can, instead of having\nthe stock default power settings,\n\n95\n00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.290\nyou can crank up the performance\nup really high so\n\n96\n00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.240\nyou can really do your password\ncracking and stuff like that.\n\n97\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.615\nYou can do that much faster, and\nyou can do your sniffing and all that, and\n\n98\n00:06:41.615 --> 00:06:45.950\nprocess data much faster, but you're gonna\npay for it in expensive battery settings.\n\n99\n00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.060\nThey try to kind of give you\na good safe balance between those,\n\n100\n00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.490\nthat you can adjust\na bit in stock Android.\n\n101\n00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.560\nBut now with root, you have\nthe ability to go one step further and\n\n102\n00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.300\nreally tweak that thing and\ngo way out to the next level on it.\n\n103\n00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.400\nOnce you get root,\nyou can see on this one right up top,\n\n104\n00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.450\nit says Got root, and\nit says right there it's a root thing.\n\n105\n00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.860\nIf you tried to install this\non a stock Android device,\n\n106\n00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.340\nwhat's going to happen is,\nas soon as you try to run it\n\n107\n00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.720\nyou hit some of the features in there\ngoing I can't do that, I can't do it.\n\n108\n00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.820\nHere if I go ahead and I click\nAccept on this thing and it's gonna\n\n109\n00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.540\ngo ahead and download it and install it,\n\n110\n00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.990\nI've got free reign to do\nwhat I want at this point.\n\n111\n00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.135\nI can go ahead and install it.\n\n112\n00:07:41.135 --> 00:07:43.320\nAnd start running whatever\ncommand's in there.\n\n113\n00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.768\nIt won't stop me from\nrunning those commands,\n\n114\n00:07:46.768 --> 00:07:50.138\nwhich is pretty nice\nthat it has that ability.\n\n115\n00:07:50.138 --> 00:07:55.346\nBut be careful, be very, very careful\nbecause, yeah, it's giving you\n\n116\n00:07:55.346 --> 00:08:00.731\nthe ability to do all that, but it's\nalso assuming you've got root [LAUGH].\n\n117\n00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:02.357\nOops, you screwed up, you screwed it up.\n\n118\n00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:04.038\nNope, sorry, boo-hoo.\n\n119\n00:08:04.038 --> 00:08:07.680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's where it's kinda got.\n\n120\n00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.266\nOther things you can do at this point.\n\n121\n00:08:10.266 --> 00:08:16.320\nYou can install additional\n\n122\n00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.543\nreporting tools on here, there's\nadditional wireless sniffing tools.\n\n123\n00:08:19.543 --> 00:08:22.900\nIf you go through Google Play,\nI'll let you look around for\n\n124\n00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.780\nthose ones since a lot of them are free.\n\n125\n00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:30.850\nYou can find those ones,\nplenty of them for doing sniffing.\n\n126\n00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:35.315\nThere's actually utilities called Shark\nthat you can install on top of Kali if you\n\n127\n00:08:35.315 --> 00:08:37.905\nwant that does additional\nlevel of sniffing and\n\n128\n00:08:37.905 --> 00:08:40.550\nactually looks just like Wireshark.\n\n129\n00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.782\nSo you have that, NMap is up there,\n\n130\n00:08:42.782 --> 00:08:45.820\nall those things you can\ninstall right on this.\n\n131\n00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:51.510\nAnd that's not even talking about the\nstock stuff that Kali brings to the table.\n\n132\n00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.055\nI mean right now except for\nthe Google Play stuff,\n\n133\n00:08:54.055 --> 00:08:56.064\nit really doesn't have much on there.\n\n134\n00:08:56.064 --> 00:09:00.643\nBut when you look through here and\nthey've got stuff in here,\n\n135\n00:09:00.643 --> 00:09:03.490\nthere's some stuff for RF.\n\n136\n00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:08.970\nAnd then there's some stuff for doing\nterminal, has a terminal emulator in here,\n\n137\n00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.100\nso it gets right on in and\nyou can run scripts and\n\n138\n00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.830\nstuff like that through there and all\nyour Linux commands right through there.\n\n139\n00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:19.170\nIt just keeps going on and\non and on and on,\n\n140\n00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.340\nbut I'll let you explore those tools\nbecause there's a lot of them there, and\n\n141\n00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.900\nthen a lot of them, there's folders it's\ngot built in there too that you can use.\n\n142\n00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.395\nBut let's talk about something\nelse that needs to be addressed.\n\n143\n00:09:30.395 --> 00:09:32.780\nSince the tools really at that point,\nthat's up to you.\n\n144\n00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.110\nWe've talked about those all in Kali..\n\n145\n00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.260\nIt's big brother.\n\n146\n00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.610\nLet's talk about stuff you need\nto really get the job done.\n\n147\n00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:45.490\nStuff you need to really get the job done,\nyou're gonna need your, just to kind of,\n\n148\n00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:49.380\nI can show you the devices here,\njust really kind of quickly.\n\n149\n00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.310\nIs you're gonna need an OTG cable,\n\n150\n00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.550\nand if you're gonna do this right\nyou're gonna need an OTG cable.\n\n151\n00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.630\nIt's a simple micro USB2 as I said before,\n\n152\n00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:04.410\na traditional USB connection,\nand so you're gonna need that.\n\n153\n00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.520\nYou're also gonna need to get or\n\n154\n00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.680\nyou're gonna want to consider at the very\nleast getting a couple other adapters.\n\n155\n00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.390\nWe do have Bluetooth sniffing tools and we\ndo have wireless sniffing tools both built\n\n156\n00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:22.360\nin there as well as other stuff that\nwe can get third party, if we want.\n\n157\n00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:22.920\nOkay.\n\n158\n00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:27.550\nThe tools that are in there, while they\nwill allow you to do that, you do need to\n\n159\n00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:31.255\nconsider getting these adapters if\nyou're going to do this sort of thing.\n\n160\n00:10:31.255 --> 00:10:36.870\nBecause these adapters,\nWiFi adapter, this is the one\n\n161\n00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:41.050\nthat a lot of people use for mobile\ndevices and doing the work that we do.\n\n162\n00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:45.170\nThis is a TP link device.\n\n163\n00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.890\nIt's a TLWN722n.\n\n164\n00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:50.481\nI'm sure you guys got that.\n\n165\n00:10:50.481 --> 00:10:51.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n166\n00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.540\nthis is the type of device\nthat a lot of people use.\n\n167\n00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:02.907\nIt's as simple as just taking a thing,\nplugging it in to your OTG adapter.\n\n168\n00:11:02.907 --> 00:11:07.790\nAnd then grabbing your tablet and\njust plugging the thing\n\n169\n00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:12.040\nright in to it, and\nyou've got it, ready to go.\n\n170\n00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:17.410\nI do put on mine that little velcro box or\nthat little velcro sticker on there.\n\n171\n00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:24.130\nI use that because I can stick as you saw\nthe back of my case for my production one.\n\n172\n00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.793\nI could just use this to stick\non the back of this thing so\n\n173\n00:11:27.793 --> 00:11:31.790\nit's not just flopping\naround looking out there.\n\n174\n00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:38.460\nNow, as far as the Bluetooth adapter,\nsame type of deal.\n\n175\n00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.530\nYou've got this is an industrial\nBluetooth adapter,\n\n176\n00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.680\nthat's literally what they call it.\n\n177\n00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:50.350\nIt's an industrial Bluetooth adapter, if\nyou plug this one in, same type of deal.\n\n178\n00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:55.180\nYou'll notice the little Bluetooth light\ncomes on that we're all familiar with.\n\n179\n00:11:55.180 --> 00:12:00.400\nIt's plugged in to the whole thing,\nand it's ready to kinda do it's job.\n\n180\n00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.430\nThis will extend the range of\nyour Bluetooth capability, but\n\n181\n00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.270\nalso most importantly,\nit's not so much the range,\n\n182\n00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:10.390\nit's the fact that it can do sniffing and\npacket injections with this.\n\n183\n00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:15.027\nYou can't do that with the Bluetooth\nadapter that's built into this guy.\n\n184\n00:12:15.027 --> 00:12:19.699\nYeah, so while the one that you have\nbuilt into these devices does have\n\n185\n00:12:19.699 --> 00:12:22.629\nthe ability to detect\nBluetooth devices and\n\n186\n00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:27.720\nhelps you do some of the blue snarfing,\nand stuff like that we talked about.\n\n187\n00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.324\nThe sniff being in\nthe more advanced attacks,\n\n188\n00:12:30.324 --> 00:12:34.597\nsome of the packet injections you can't\ndo with the one that comes with these\n\n189\n00:12:34.597 --> 00:12:39.240\ndevices, so if that's something you\nwant to get into, Bluetooth hacking.\n\n190\n00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.700\nYou need to get some sort of\nindustrial Bluetooth adapter.\n\n191\n00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:48.580\nThis one happens to be from SENA, S-E-N-A.\n\n192\n00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.062\nYou can just grab that and it's not\na bad thing to have because, heck,\n\n193\n00:12:52.062 --> 00:12:55.978\nyou can just plug that into your regular\nnotebook and get that capability too.\n\n194\n00:12:55.978 --> 00:12:59.124\nCuz typically the ones in notebooks\nwith Bluetooth adapters and\n\n195\n00:12:59.124 --> 00:13:03.820\nPCs don't have those abilities either,\nand they definitely don't have the range.\n\n196\n00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.170\nThe range for this one, the antenna on\nthis one, you can actually unscrew it and\n\n197\n00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.292\nput in special adapters and\n\n198\n00:13:08.292 --> 00:13:12.910\nextend it out, I think you can\nextend it out to almost a mile.\n\n199\n00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:17.550\nYour Bluetooth capability, so you're\ntalking some pretty heavy hitters there\n\n200\n00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:21.140\nfor something like this\nto be able to do that.\n\n201\n00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:25.490\nNow you can grab one of these things and\nput your Kindle app on here and read and\n\n202\n00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:28.800\nhave your drink or whatever while you're\nsitting outside picking up everyone's\n\n203\n00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:34.050\nmobile device and\nkind of scanning through the devices.\n\n204\n00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:35.540\nYou can do that now.\n\n205\n00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.194\nSo that's kind of that.\n\n206\n00:13:37.194 --> 00:13:40.438\nBut something else I kinda\nwant to point out here,\n\n207\n00:13:40.438 --> 00:13:44.843\nanother post-installation task is\nthat you can use the OTG cable,\n\n208\n00:13:44.843 --> 00:13:48.330\nflash drives, and\nyou can put flash drives in there.\n\n209\n00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:50.170\nYou can put external hard drives in there.\n\n210\n00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.830\nAll those things are on\nthe table with this.\n\n211\n00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.270\nSo that's another really\ncool thing you have.\n\n212\n00:13:54.270 --> 00:14:00.305\nI would also consider, up to you,\nbut consider getting a USB\n\n213\n00:14:00.305 --> 00:14:05.085\nethernet adapter to put in here,\nbecause plug the thing into a regular\n\n214\n00:14:05.085 --> 00:14:08.645\nnetwork right now, we only have\nwireless is what we have here.\n\n215\n00:14:08.645 --> 00:14:12.617\nHaving that ability to do that also allows\nyou to do sniffing right off the wire.\n\n216\n00:14:12.617 --> 00:14:15.497\nSo you're gonna wanna be able to do that,\nso that would be another thing that you're\n\n217\n00:14:15.497 --> 00:14:19.607\ngonna do post installation to have\nthat other level of capability.\n\n218\n00:14:19.607 --> 00:14:25.335\nSo yeah, you could grab really any one of\nthem out here and just plug the guy in.\n\n219\n00:14:25.335 --> 00:14:29.872\nAnd I, when's that new spec of USB coming\nout that lets you plug in either way?\n\n220\n00:14:29.872 --> 00:14:31.031\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n221\n00:14:31.031 --> 00:14:34.916\nI'll put that thing whatever way I want.\n\n222\n00:14:34.916 --> 00:14:38.670\nYeah, so but, you just plug the thing in,\nand you've got it.\n\n223\n00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:41.076\nNow, you've got ethernet capability.\n\n224\n00:14:41.076 --> 00:14:43.290\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yep, it's right there.\n\n225\n00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.680\nSo that's the cool thing.\n\n226\n00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.690\nThis is something, this OTG adapter is\nsomething that you definitely wanna have.\n\n227\n00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:51.260\nBefore you start deciding\nwhatever device you have,\n\n228\n00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.900\ndecide to start splitting it into\nlittle y cables and all that.\n\n229\n00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.960\nSome of them you can do that, despite\nwhat I said earlier, you can do that in\n\n230\n00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.090\nsome cases but the reason why it sounds\nlike I'm kind of doing doublespeak and\n\n231\n00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:04.010\ngoing against what I say.\n\n232\n00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.480\nIs that I'm not really going\nagainst what I said earlier.\n\n233\n00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.560\nWhat I'm telling you to do is check\nbecause you might be able to get\n\n234\n00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.850\na device that you can plug\nboth these things in and\n\n235\n00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.170\nthere's enough power to go around for\nboth of them.\n\n236\n00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:19.620\nBut that's true for notebooks and\nstuff like that too.\n\n237\n00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.280\nYou might find a port that you get lucky.\n\n238\n00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.431\nIt's putting out a little\nbit more power or\n\n239\n00:15:23.431 --> 00:15:25.537\nsomething and you can get enough on this.\n\n240\n00:15:25.537 --> 00:15:30.759\nThat's more likely to find that\nsituation on a notebook or\n\n241\n00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:35.128\ndesktop device than it would\nbe to find on a mobile\n\n242\n00:15:35.128 --> 00:15:39.300\ndevice that is already\nworking on less power.\n\n243\n00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.460\nSo expect to get one of these, but\ndon't expect to get them both.\n\n244\n00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.240\nThat's gonna be a limiting factor for\nthis.\n\n245\n00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:49.560\nThat at least is a limiting\nfactor right now.\n\n246\n00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.490\nSo, you've got your tablet.\n\n247\n00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.250\nYou've installed your updates.\n\n248\n00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.932\nYou've put your Gmail account or\n\n249\n00:15:57.932 --> 00:16:02.156\nGoogle Play account as\nthe case may be on this thing.\n\n250\n00:16:02.156 --> 00:16:04.990\nYou start installing tools as you see fit.\n\n251\n00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:08.600\nYou've configured the tools\nthat are on here and\n\n252\n00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:13.278\nthose tools work pretty much\nthe same way that they do for Kali.\n\n253\n00:16:13.278 --> 00:16:16.543\nSo if any of the tools that are on here,\nyou can go into Kali and\n\n254\n00:16:16.543 --> 00:16:19.317\njust pull those things across and\nyou'll be fine.\n\n255\n00:16:19.317 --> 00:16:23.750\nSo we've got a pretty\npowerful thing in here.\n\n256\n00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:27.000\nStart thinking next about for\npost installation.\n\n257\n00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.560\nWhat type of case you're gonna put it in,\nbecause one\n\n258\n00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:34.540\nof the big benefits is concealment and\nyou're not gonna conceal this too well\n\n259\n00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.070\nif you've got these things stuck on the\nback because that's not a normal thing.\n\n260\n00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.010\nIf you do like I have, where I can\nfold the cover over on the thing\n\n261\n00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:46.230\nlike most people do with those types\nof things to make it look like a book,\n\n262\n00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.950\nI can hide that between those front and\nback pages in here.\n\n263\n00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.160\nSo I'm sitting here reading and\n\n264\n00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.590\ndoing stuff and\nthey're not gonna be suspicious about it.\n\n265\n00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:55.687\nI'll be like, how's it going?\n\n266\n00:16:55.687 --> 00:16:57.350\nAnd just keep going back to read.\n\n267\n00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.510\nDoesn't draw undue attention.\n\n268\n00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:00.970\nSo you have to think about those.\n\n269\n00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.110\nIt's not just technology side.\n\n270\n00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.150\nIt's these additional\ncapabilities in here.\n\n271\n00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:12.900\nOne other thing, just to kind of mention\nwith this is the micro USB cable.\n\n272\n00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:17.966\nThe micro USB cable not these,\nreason why you wanna have the micro USB\n\n273\n00:17:17.966 --> 00:17:23.553\ncable is not just because of the normal\nthing to charge it and transfer data,\n\n274\n00:17:23.553 --> 00:17:28.703\nanother benefit of it is that you can\nget a utility of both a free and a pro\n\n275\n00:17:28.703 --> 00:17:35.028\nversion for Android that what it does is\nit actually allows it's called DriveDroid.\n\n276\n00:17:35.028 --> 00:17:39.780\nAnd what you gonna do is you can\nactually download ISO into that,\n\n277\n00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:44.092\nand I can, to plug it into\nwhatever target system I want and\n\n278\n00:17:44.092 --> 00:17:46.910\nload the ISO directly on that system.\n\n279\n00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.824\nYou use this as an external flash device.\n\n280\n00:17:49.824 --> 00:17:53.214\nAnd that supports actually ISOs like,\n\n281\n00:17:53.214 --> 00:17:57.634\nthere's a distro for\nOphcrack password cracker.\n\n282\n00:17:57.634 --> 00:18:00.251\nIt will actually download the SAM\nfile off a Windows system and\n\n283\n00:18:00.251 --> 00:18:02.730\nallow you to go through and\nstart busting things in there.\n\n284\n00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:04.497\nSo you can do that.\n\n285\n00:18:04.497 --> 00:18:07.988\nYou can actually download\nfull blown Kali into that.\n\n286\n00:18:07.988 --> 00:18:11.775\nAnd so, if you've got your NetHunter\ndevice, you're doing your recon,\n\n287\n00:18:11.775 --> 00:18:15.320\nnow, you wanna switch over to Kali,\ncuz maybe there's stuff that you\n\n288\n00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.434\ncan install in Kali that you can't install\nin Kali NetHunter which does happen.\n\n289\n00:18:19.434 --> 00:18:23.402\nWhat you can do is just\ncustomize your Kali image and\n\n290\n00:18:23.402 --> 00:18:27.737\njust dump it on this device and\nall the sudden plug it in,\n\n291\n00:18:27.737 --> 00:18:31.450\nreboot, and\nstart going about your business.\n\n292\n00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:35.139\nI mean, you can extract all sorts of\ndata and crack out that device and\n\n293\n00:18:35.139 --> 00:18:38.717\neverything else you want and\nwhen you're done unplug it and go on.\n\n294\n00:18:38.717 --> 00:18:42.930\nAs far as anyone else is concerned,\nthey see you working on that system.\n\n295\n00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.570\nHey, you're charging your device,\naren't you?\n\n296\n00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:46.810\nYeah, I'm charging my device.\n\n297\n00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.542\nI forgot my charger at home.\n\n298\n00:18:48.542 --> 00:18:50.500\nI didn't left the plug at home,\nbut I've got this.\n\n299\n00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.270\nOkay.\nHey, I know.\n\n300\n00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:52.080\nI've been there.\n\n301\n00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.320\nSucks, but have a nice day.\n\n302\n00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.190\nThat's the big benefit of stuff like this.\n\n303\n00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.580\nSo once you've done that post\nconfiguration of all the updates and\n\n304\n00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:04.740\ngot your tools on there, whatever those\nmay be and you got familiar with this,\n\n305\n00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.900\nthink about concealment.\n\n306\n00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.200\nThink about that next thing.\n\n307\n00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.850\nDon't make this thing look like\nanything out of the ordinary.\n\n308\n00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:18.490\nI like to have this thing setup, so\nwhen I go to my standby back here\n\n309\n00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:26.340\nor my production one,\nthat's a tablet, period.\n\n310\n00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:29.480\nNow, they're not thinking,\nis that an evil tablet, a bad tablet.\n\n311\n00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.476\nThat would be a good name for\na line of tablets, evil tablets.\n\n312\n00:19:33.476 --> 00:19:34.315\nDon't steal that.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n313\n00:19:34.315 --> 00:19:38.780\n>> Kickstart a project next week.\n\n314\n00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:42.920\nIt looks completely normal,\nI've got these velcro spots on the back,\n\n315\n00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.160\nI can attach stuff on.\n\n316\n00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.699\nAnd I'm just off to the races here.\n\n317\n00:19:48.699 --> 00:19:53.468\nI just, like I said, just go through,\n\n318\n00:19:53.468 --> 00:19:58.106\nput my stuff on here, flip it around.\n\n319\n00:19:58.106 --> 00:20:01.007\nIt's 100% concealed.\n\n320\n00:20:01.007 --> 00:20:01.870\n>> Nice.\n\n321\n00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:07.060\n>> So that's what you're looking for.\n\n322\n00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:10.926\nSo keep all those things in\nmind when you're doing this.\n\n323\n00:20:10.926 --> 00:20:14.230\nAnd make sure you get\nthe most memory you can.\n\n324\n00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.620\nMake sure,\nbecause that's the biggest thing.\n\n325\n00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.180\nGet the most amount of memory that you can\nbecause you're gonna find a lot of little\n\n326\n00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.400\ntoys that you wanna add on to it.\n\n327\n00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.912\nSo that would be just a kind of\nlook of some things you do after\n\n328\n00:20:24.912 --> 00:20:28.008\nyou do the install and\nconfirm that it's working and\n\n329\n00:20:28.008 --> 00:20:31.621\nall that good stuff,\nall the things you're gonna wanna do.\n\n330\n00:20:31.621 --> 00:20:34.897\nThose adaptors, you can go on Amazon or\n\n331\n00:20:34.897 --> 00:20:41.420\nanything like that to find them,\nthey're relatively easy to find.\n\n332\n00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.077\n>> Very good.\n\n333\n00:20:42.077 --> 00:20:43.230\nWell Sean, there you go.\n\n334\n00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:49.020\nWe've got our Kali NetHunter\ninstalled on our Nexus 7 device.\n\n335\n00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.166\nGreat show.\n\n336\n00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:51.960\nAny parting words for us?\n\n337\n00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.760\n>> Yeah,\nnow it's time to go start hacking.\n\n338\n00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.494\nWhat the heck are you\nstill doing watching this?\n\n339\n00:20:56.494 --> 00:20:59.287\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You should have credit card numbers\n\n340\n00:20:59.287 --> 00:21:00.183\nstolen by now.\n\n341\n00:21:00.183 --> 00:21:03.372\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But,\n\n342\n00:21:03.372 --> 00:21:08.650\njust a, Now seriously let me add\non here to the end of this is that\n\n343\n00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:13.640\ngetting these devices,\nplay around, experiment with them.\n\n344\n00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.090\nWe just showed you Kali NetHunter and\n\n345\n00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:19.230\nthen we're also gonna show you stuff with\nsetting up a Pwn Pad which is a more,\n\n346\n00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:21.700\nthe one that a lot of\npeople are familiar with.\n\n347\n00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.820\nHeck, you've got two very powerful\ndevices there but experiment.\n\n348\n00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.590\nOnce you get comfortable doing this,\nexperiment.\n\n349\n00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:32.360\nTry using the Nexus root toolkit to\ninstall some of these other ROM on there.\n\n350\n00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.099\nBecause that may be the next\nstep after you do this.\n\n351\n00:21:34.099 --> 00:21:38.410\nYou may wanna decide, Offensive Security\nand Pwnie Express got their own.\n\n352\n00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:39.190\nAnd that's great.\n\n353\n00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:40.420\nI like those.\n\n354\n00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.239\nBut, can I, what can I do on my own?\n\n355\n00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.820\nAnd then, you've got the tools here to\nload your own stuff here and customize it.\n\n356\n00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:48.600\nYou should have at it.\n\n357\n00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.710\nHave some fun with it.\n\n358\n00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:56.990\nThese devices, as far as creating\nthese devices and these tablets.\n\n359\n00:21:56.990 --> 00:22:01.476\nThe reason why I look like\nan insane maniac out here, and\n\n360\n00:22:01.476 --> 00:22:07.700\ngot all these tablets sitting with me\nout here, is doctor told me [CROSSTALK].\n\n361\n00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:08.920\nYeah, I am insane.\n\n362\n00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.427\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] As anyone who knows me,\n\n363\n00:22:12.427 --> 00:22:16.691\nas anyone that's watching\nthis stuff knows.\n\n364\n00:22:16.691 --> 00:22:18.016\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you guys put\n\n365\n00:22:18.016 --> 00:22:20.826\na dislike button on your forums,\nI'm gonna get a lot of those.\n\n366\n00:22:20.826 --> 00:22:25.175\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, I would tell you why,\n\n367\n00:22:25.175 --> 00:22:28.340\nsince these devices are relatively cheap,\n\n368\n00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.190\nespecially something like a Nexus 7\nis a great one to experiment with.\n\n369\n00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:32.339\nIt's very well-behaved.\n\n370\n00:22:32.339 --> 00:22:36.859\nIt's a great one to use in production\nas well as being a nice starter one to\n\n371\n00:22:36.859 --> 00:22:37.610\nplay with.\n\n372\n00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:43.923\nGet one of these things, buy one off of\neBay, Amazon, get one from a friend or\n\n373\n00:22:43.923 --> 00:22:44.687\nwhatever.\n\n374\n00:22:44.687 --> 00:22:46.882\nMaybe they're not using anymore,\nplay around with it,\n\n375\n00:22:46.882 --> 00:22:48.092\ntry different things with it.\n\n376\n00:22:48.092 --> 00:22:52.160\nI mean I saw and\nactually saw a working one\n\n377\n00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:56.602\nin that just had a couple scuff marks\non it on eBay earlier, 45 bucks.\n\n378\n00:22:56.602 --> 00:23:00.221\nI mean, this is a great way to\nkinda get your feet wet and\n\n379\n00:23:00.221 --> 00:23:04.864\nplay around with this and heck if\nyou do brick it, I mean it's, yeah,\n\n380\n00:23:04.864 --> 00:23:10.258\nit's 45 bucks, no one wants to lose\n45 bucks but it ain't 300, 400.\n\n381\n00:23:10.258 --> 00:23:16.360\nOnce you get your feet wet and get used\nto how Android devices can work and\n\n382\n00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.810\nhave all these things to do.\n\n383\n00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:19.320\nThen, heck.\n\n384\n00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.880\nTake it to the next level.\n\n385\n00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.410\n>> Very good.\n\n386\n00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:23.760\nWell, there you have it,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n387\n00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.750\nThat's gonna do it for this one.\n\n388\n00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.340\nWe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n389\n00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.607\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick\n>> And I'm Sean

00:00:14.960\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.080\nWith me today is the famous Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.864\nAnd Sean, in this episode, we're going\nto be taking a look at something\n\n6\n00:00:20.864 --> 00:00:22.550\ncalled a Pwn Pad and a Pwn Phone.\n\n7\n00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.890\nThey sound, they got really cool names, so\n\n8\n00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.110\nI'm assuming they're really cool products,\nSean.\n\n9\n00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.815\nTell us all about them.\n\n10\n00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:32.570\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah let's explore these things.\n\n11\n00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.200\nLet's pwn this.\n\n12\n00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.660\nSo what we're talking about is about\nthe Pwn Phone and the Pwn Pad.\n\n13\n00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.170\nOf those two we are gonna show you\nhow to do the actual Pwn Phone, or\n\n14\n00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.060\nsorry, the Pwn Pad itself\nusing just a tablet.\n\n15\n00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.280\nSo what we have is we're gonna\ngo through that process.\n\n16\n00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.810\nSo the question is really getting down to\nis, what is the Pwn Pad and the Pwn Phone?\n\n17\n00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.720\nWell what these are is these are devices\nthat were put out by Pwnie Express and\n\n18\n00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.712\nthey still very much market these things,\nand\n\n19\n00:01:10.712 --> 00:01:13.564\nsell a reasonable amount of them, I guess.\n\n20\n00:01:13.564 --> 00:01:17.736\nI don't know what their numbers are or\nanything, so I'll just say reasonable and\n\n21\n00:01:17.736 --> 00:01:20.108\nI'll let them figure\nout what reasonable is.\n\n22\n00:01:20.108 --> 00:01:22.047\nMore than one.\n\n23\n00:01:22.047 --> 00:01:28.169\nBut what it is, is that Pwnie Express\nput these out because it\n\n24\n00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:34.172\nallows you to do penetration\ntesting in a mobile platform,\n\n25\n00:01:34.172 --> 00:01:40.530\nin a much much much easier way,\nI guess you could say that.\n\n26\n00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.070\nBut you've got a mobile device,\nyou've got a lot of powerful tools on it,\n\n27\n00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.658\nyou've got a small form factor,\nall the stuff that we talked about.\n\n28\n00:01:46.658 --> 00:01:51.580\nAnd you can go and do just a tremendous\namount of strikes against various targets.\n\n29\n00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.830\nAnd have a lot of capabilities to\nmess with stuff and try things out.\n\n30\n00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.920\nSo, that's a good thing.\n\n31\n00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.930\nWell, what we have is\nwhat Pwnie Express sells,\n\n32\n00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.000\nis they will go through and sell you a Pwn\nPad, which is gonna be based on our Nexus\n\n33\n00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.240\n7 devices that we are using for\ncreating our NetHunter.\n\n34\n00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.382\nSo it's gonna be the same type of device.\n\n35\n00:02:20.382 --> 00:02:24.100\nSo basically they sell these for\nit, for the Nexus 7s.\n\n36\n00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.840\nAnd they also sell on\nNexus 5 based devices.\n\n37\n00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.920\nSo that's one of the reasons why if\nyou're wondering why I went through\n\n38\n00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.150\nKali Nethunter, it's part of the reason\nI chose these two devices over anything\n\n39\n00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.040\nelse, it's not just that I liked what\nthey had in the features and everything.\n\n40\n00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.620\nI know I can switch back and forth between\nthe Pwn Pad and Kali Nethunter seamlessly.\n\n41\n00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.250\nThat's all it was.\n\n42\n00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.980\nIt's just a case of backing up my data,\nputting the new stuff on there,\n\n43\n00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.110\nrestoring it, and calling it a day.\n\n44\n00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.949\nSo that was something I was looking for\nto have that flexibility.\n\n45\n00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:54.304\nIf it wasn't that,\n\n46\n00:02:54.304 --> 00:02:59.738\nthen I'd be like some kinda crazy person\ncarrying three tablets around with me.\n\n47\n00:02:59.738 --> 00:03:04.595\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Who would do that?\n\n48\n00:03:04.595 --> 00:03:08.550\nBut that's why I chose these things.\n\n49\n00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.500\nBut as far as\nthe Pwnie Express devices go,\n\n50\n00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.930\nit's gonna be a Nexus 5 and\na Nexus 7 for right now.\n\n51\n00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.410\nLook on their site for\nany changes to that, but\n\n52\n00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.990\nthat seems to be the ones that they're\nembracing, which is just fine for us.\n\n53\n00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.510\nOkay so, things you can do with\neither one of these devices,\n\n54\n00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.660\nyou can pretty much do almost\nthe whole penetration testing process.\n\n55\n00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.045\nAnd if you really want to,\nyou can kinda push the envelope there and\n\n56\n00:03:39.045 --> 00:03:43.823\ninstall other tools on top of it and\nreally punch up the power enough where\n\n57\n00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:48.315\nyou can do just about anything in\nthe penetration testing process.\n\n58\n00:03:48.315 --> 00:03:51.708\nI have the ability on my Nexus 5,\n\n59\n00:03:51.708 --> 00:03:56.194\nrunning the Pwnie Express Pwn Phone stuff,\n\n60\n00:03:56.194 --> 00:04:02.028\nI've really put this kind of\non a bulking up type of diet.\n\n61\n00:04:02.028 --> 00:04:06.363\nAnd so what it has, it has the ability\nto do the whole testing process,\n\n62\n00:04:06.363 --> 00:04:11.324\nall sorts of SQL injections, application\ntesting, vulnerability testing.\n\n63\n00:04:11.324 --> 00:04:16.330\nAnd scanning, it's got automated\nthings to break into networks.\n\n64\n00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.740\nIt's got all that stuff plus it\nhas stuff to even go after and\n\n65\n00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.420\ntarget stuff like smart meters and\npower grid type stuff.\n\n66\n00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.448\nSo, what I'm saying is don't tick me off.\n\n67\n00:04:25.448 --> 00:04:29.425\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All I gotta do is make a phone call.\n\n68\n00:04:29.425 --> 00:04:34.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it's got all abilities so you\n\n69\n00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.850\ncan have core stock abilities and you can\nenhance that, which we gotta love that.\n\n70\n00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.560\nThat gives us just so much to talk about.\n\n71\n00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.130\nOkay, now, with such such a great device\navailable, if you're in a pen testing it\n\n72\n00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.490\nsounds like, well,\nheck I gotta get me some of that action.\n\n73\n00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.140\nI wanna get one.\n\n74\n00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.250\nOkay, well there's gonna be\nsome issues with getting one.\n\n75\n00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.090\nI don't know if I should say issues,\nbut there's probably gonna be giving\n\n76\n00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.310\nyou a nice heart attack when you see it,\nif you haven't already.\n\n77\n00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.260\nIf you go up to the Pwnie Express site,\nwhich I've brought up for you here,\n\n78\n00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.737\nthe Pwnie Express site,\nthat's the Pwn Pad right now, $995.\n\n79\n00:05:16.737 --> 00:05:21.828\nIt uses Nexus 7 tablet, so,\nsomething I told you you can get for\n\n80\n00:05:21.828 --> 00:05:25.800\n50, 60, hundred bucks,\nsome of them even go up to 300 bucks.\n\n81\n00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.220\nYou can get a brand new one for 300 bucks\nif you really want a brand new one.\n\n82\n00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.990\nSo, you get that, and you're getting\nthat device plus you're getting\n\n83\n00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.300\nthem to do all this stuff on top of it and\nthey're charging you 1,000 bucks.\n\n84\n00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.770\nAnd they're giving you the adapters and\nall that fancy stuff I was showing you.\n\n85\n00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.620\nAnd the Kali NetHunter stuff.\n\n86\n00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.780\nAnd that's not their only ones.\n\n87\n00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.620\nThey have the Pwn Pad 3.\n\n88\n00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.760\nif you want to get the earlier\nversion of it, it's $1,300.\n\n89\n00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.110\nSo again, you're just taking the same\n\n90\n00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.290\nNexus 7 device and\nnow loading their special flavor\n\n91\n00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.110\nof Android on it with their stuff.\n\n92\n00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.210\nAnd now you've got that.\n\n93\n00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.280\nAnd I'm definitely not trying\nto bash on them or anything,\n\n94\n00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.550\nlook at the ungodly amount they're\ncharging for these things,\n\n95\n00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.170\nno it's because they also offer support\nand stuff like that too, by the way.\n\n96\n00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.928\nIt's not like they're just saying watch\nwe're gonna screw the customer watch this.\n\n97\n00:06:30.928 --> 00:06:35.210\nHey, 1300 bucks, yeah we paid 100\nbucks for it, but we went through and\n\n98\n00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.595\ndid some magic pixie dust on it and\nwe're going charge 1300 bucks on it.\n\n99\n00:06:38.595 --> 00:06:41.800\nNo, they're installing the stuff on there.\n\n100\n00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.320\nThey're giving you the extra adapters and\n\n101\n00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.320\nall that stuff and they're giving you\na nice case, I mean, hey look at that.\n\n102\n00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.000\nBut they're also giving you\nsupport with it too, so.\n\n103\n00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.310\nBut just to be fair.\n\n104\n00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:59.340\nOkay, but let's kind of talk about these\nthings because we've got those two.\n\n105\n00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.800\nWe also have the Pwn Phone.\n\n106\n00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.110\nIf you look at it.\n\n107\n00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.060\nThis Pwn Phone, 1300 bucks for\nthat, same type of thing.\n\n108\n00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:12.270\nThey've got a Nexus 5 device,\nthey've loaded all the stuff on it and\n\n109\n00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.270\nnow they have a $1,300 device.\n\n110\n00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.960\nAnd yeah you look at mine, $200.\n\n111\n00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.305\nSo, marked down.\n\n112\n00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:24.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The thing is is that when\n\n113\n00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:29.330\nI talk about this, I'm not trying to\nsay I marked it down and all that.\n\n114\n00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.170\nYeah I'm making a joke, but I'm also kind\nof telling you, you guys can do this too.\n\n115\n00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:39.180\nThere's no reason you can't have your\nown Pwn Pad and your own Pwn Phone,\n\n116\n00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.210\nif you're willing to put the effort in and\nget your hands dirty.\n\n117\n00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:47.711\nYou've already got some of\nthose skills developed already,\n\n118\n00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:51.422\nso it's not a question\nof if you can do it.\n\n119\n00:07:51.422 --> 00:07:54.996\nIt's a question of are you just\nwilling to try some stuff out,\n\n120\n00:07:54.996 --> 00:07:59.560\nbe willing to be willing to fail and\nlearn from mistakes and put this together.\n\n121\n00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.374\nIt's actually fairly straightforward,\n\n122\n00:08:02.374 --> 00:08:07.607\nthere's a reason why I did the Kali Net\nHunter stuff first, before the Pwnpad,\n\n123\n00:08:07.607 --> 00:08:12.058\nbecause the Kali Net Hunter's you\nsaw If you watch those episodes,\n\n124\n00:08:12.058 --> 00:08:15.670\nit's a very simple installation process,\nyou know?\n\n125\n00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.370\nSo, we saw the Nexus root toolkit.\n\n126\n00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.120\nNexus root toolkit could be a very\nhandy thing to help you get out of\n\n127\n00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.450\nproblems here, too.\n\n128\n00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:23.260\nBut you've got.\n\n129\n00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.310\nThe thing is, those two things, alone.\n\n130\n00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.850\nThe Nexus root tool kit,\nand Kali NetHunter.\n\n131\n00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.640\nAnd then creating your own\nKali NetHunter device.\n\n132\n00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.620\nIs actually a great way to get\nyou ready for the next step,\n\n133\n00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.280\nwhich is to build even\na more powerful device.\n\n134\n00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.755\nIn my opinion, a more powerful device,\nin the form of Pwnpad.\n\n135\n00:08:39.755 --> 00:08:44.190\nPwnpad does not have the simple,\nif you want to call it that, the simple\n\n136\n00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.810\ninstallation process that, or the same\ntype of installation process rather,\n\n137\n00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:53.918\nthat the Pwn or\nthat the Kali NetHunter device has.\n\n138\n00:08:53.918 --> 00:08:58.540\nYou have a wizard on Kali NetHunter,\nyou've got a script that you gotta run.\n\n139\n00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.350\nThat script only runs in Linux, so\n\n140\n00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:04.630\nyou can't, that Windows stuff is\nout of the picture at that point.\n\n141\n00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.950\nSo, we're gonna have to go through and\n\n142\n00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.990\ntalk about how you set\nup a stock Linux device.\n\n143\n00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.270\nTo be able to talk to this, and\n\n144\n00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.540\nload the appropriate stuff to get it\nto actually make that script run.\n\n145\n00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:17.480\nIt's not difficult.\n\n146\n00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.370\nEvery last one of you can do it.\n\n147\n00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.450\nJust, do you really want to do this?\n\n148\n00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:25.170\nOr do you wanna, you know,\npay the money for it?\n\n149\n00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.851\nAnd if you want one,\nI'm selling, one of these for\n\n150\n00:09:28.851 --> 00:09:32.720\nlike the $1300 model, $1100 no problem.\n\n151\n00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.760\nFor our IT pro viewers.\n\n152\n00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:39.970\nBut anyway, so\n>> He's just kidding,\n\n153\n00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.240\nplease don't be calling down here and\n\n154\n00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.165\nasking where if I can buy Sean's Pwnpad,\ncuz he's not really selling it.\n\n155\n00:09:47.165 --> 00:09:48.380\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I'm not selling it,\n\n156\n00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.330\nI'm selling the autograph\non the back of it.\n\n157\n00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.700\nThe pad's free.\n\n158\n00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.350\nAutograph, $1,100.\n\n159\n00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:54.638\nSo, yeah, he's right.\n\n160\n00:09:54.638 --> 00:09:59.040\nSo.\n[LAUGH] Offer not valid in the contiguous\n\n161\n00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.546\n50 states.\n\n162\n00:10:00.546 --> 00:10:03.331\nSo, 48 states.\n\n163\n00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:05.750\nSo, what we have is we have,\n\n164\n00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:11.010\nwe want to create a Pwn Phone,\nwe decided that we want one,\n\n165\n00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:15.100\nbut that's too much and\nwe don't really need the support.\n\n166\n00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.580\nLike I said,\nI'm not bashing on the price of it.\n\n167\n00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.450\nThe price of it is, you're paying for\nsupport, someone has to sit there and\n\n168\n00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.670\nhelp you out.\n\n169\n00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.440\nA lot of us have worked support,\nso we know that time is money, so\n\n170\n00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.020\nyou're paying for that, and\nthey do offer some training with it, too.\n\n171\n00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.740\nBut if you're willing to,\nif you're technically inclined,\n\n172\n00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:38.230\nif you're someone that's willing to\nput the effort in, you can do this.\n\n173\n00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.580\nSo, you absolutely can do this and,\nhopefully,\n\n174\n00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.250\nafter you watch this episode and\nthe other episodes we have,\n\n175\n00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.950\ninstalling the stuff for\nthe Pwnpad, you're in good shape.\n\n176\n00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:53.630\nOkay, so, this is gonna be a little\nmore difficult, but it's doable.\n\n177\n00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:56.880\nThings that you need to know going in.\n\n178\n00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.700\nFirst of all,\nwhat type of device do you wanna have?\n\n179\n00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.550\nDo you want to have phone?\n\n180\n00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.040\nDo you want to have a tablet?\n\n181\n00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.060\nWhich way do you want to go?\n\n182\n00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.760\nYou know, you have to think about\nwhich way that's going to be.\n\n183\n00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.990\nHey, for me, I went ahead and\ngot them all.\n\n184\n00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:14.000\nI've got a bunch of tablets,\nI've got extra phones, you know,\n\n185\n00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.980\nat home that I use to try different\nconfigurations and all that and so\n\n186\n00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.700\nyou've gotta decide but\nyou don't have to go that far.\n\n187\n00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:25.920\nI say just get something that has\na good amount of space on it so\n\n188\n00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.410\nif you get a Nexus 7 or a Nexus 5 device,\n\n189\n00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.320\nget something that has a lot\nof space on it and go for it.\n\n190\n00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.520\nAs far as either one of these devices,\ndo you need something that\n\n191\n00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.720\nhas access to mobile networks in the form\nof cellphone sub-layout, that's your call.\n\n192\n00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.030\nThe Nexus 5 device I have back\nhere set up as a pin device,\n\n193\n00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.120\nthat's also my regular phone too.\n\n194\n00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:50.570\nSo that one does have my\nSIM card in it for that.\n\n195\n00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.410\nBut I didn't need to do that, I have\nanother Nexus 5 device that's got no SIM\n\n196\n00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:59.850\ncard in it, and I just use it for\nwi-fi stuff and things relating to that.\n\n197\n00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:03.530\nI don't need the other stuff, but\nI could very easily pop one in.\n\n198\n00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.670\nAnd the cool things about these is if\nyou really wanna do it the right way,\n\n199\n00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:11.360\nyou could create a burner phone off this,\nyou can actually get a phone like this for\n\n200\n00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.185\npen testing and\nbuy a SIM card specifically for\n\n201\n00:12:15.185 --> 00:12:17.440\nthat job with a phone number and\neverything on it.\n\n202\n00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.060\nOnce you're done with that job,\npop out the SIM card and chuck it.\n\n203\n00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:25.480\nSo that's another attractive\noption with this.\n\n204\n00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.208\nOr you can use it to stalk\nyour ex-girlfriend like I do.\n\n205\n00:12:29.208 --> 00:12:31.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And when they trace it down,\n\n206\n00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.320\nthrow it away.\n\n207\n00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:32.837\nAll right.\n\n208\n00:12:32.837 --> 00:12:34.930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So But that's me.\n\n209\n00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:35.430\nAlright.\n\n210\n00:12:36.845 --> 00:12:41.680\nSo, you'll decide whether or\nnot put a mobile network or not.\n\n211\n00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:46.770\nAnd just by the way, even though I'm not,\nI should put a little disclaimer on that,\n\n212\n00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:49.450\nnot in the stalking part,\nI totally do that.\n\n213\n00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:53.390\nOn the other part,\nas far as putting the SIM card in there.\n\n214\n00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.840\nThese things take a mini SIM card,\na micro SIM card.\n\n215\n00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.930\nJust double check to make sure\nyou've got the right one.\n\n216\n00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.770\nGo and buy one of those prepaid ones.\n\n217\n00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.980\nIf you go into one of the cellphone\nproviders, I guarantee I'm keeping you out\n\n218\n00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.260\nof trouble here and I'm keeping you\nfrom getting a lot of weird looks and.\n\n219\n00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.970\nAnd just a bunch of other stuff.\n\n220\n00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:23.140\nIf you carry a device like on of these\ninto something like a T Mobile store.\n\n221\n00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.720\nWhat's gonna happen is, and\nI'm not just picking on T Mobile.\n\n222\n00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.430\nBut let's just say you walk into\na T Mobile store or Verizon store or\n\n223\n00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:31.390\nwhatever and say, hey,\nI need a micro SIM for this.\n\n224\n00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.910\nOkay, what type of device is it and\nall that?\n\n225\n00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.080\nAt some point you know how they are.\n\n226\n00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.710\nThey're like, oh well, we'll set it up for\nyou and everything else, and\n\n227\n00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:40.540\nwe need all this account and everything\nset up and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n228\n00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.810\nAt some point this phone's gonna go,\n\n229\n00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:45.520\noh we're gonna turn the thing on to go\nlike, what the hell did you do this thing?\n\n230\n00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.440\nAnd they're, well what are you doing?\n\n231\n00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.830\nAnd if they recognize those things\nthey may very well say, no,\n\n232\n00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.160\nno we're not selling this to this to you.\n\n233\n00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.380\nYou don't know what you're doing.\n\n234\n00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.810\nAnd we don't want that on our network.\n\n235\n00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.450\nThey, it's their network,\nthey can very well say that.\n\n236\n00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:59.990\nSo, I would say even though you know and\n\n237\n00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:04.310\nI know that, well hopefully you're not\nout here up to any mischief or anything.\n\n238\n00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.900\nI know when I'm having this\nthing on when I'm putting this\n\n239\n00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.680\nthing on the network that I'm on,\nno I wasn't using it for any of that.\n\n240\n00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.870\nI double checked it with a test phone to\nmake sure nothing was was gonna cause\n\n241\n00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:17.340\nanything just by being there,\nand there's nothing squawking or\n\n242\n00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:18.710\nchecking anything out.\n\n243\n00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.090\nI did that as a safety thing.\n\n244\n00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.610\nSo, I went ahead and got the card myself.\n\n245\n00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:25.460\nNo problem.\n\n246\n00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.210\nNo one asked any questions.\n\n247\n00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:29.620\nI don't happen to have a single problem.\n\n248\n00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.930\nSo that's something,\nperception is an important part of this.\n\n249\n00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.910\nIt's an important part of this process.\n\n250\n00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:37.810\nSo you should know what type\nof SIM card to get, just,\n\n251\n00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.740\nif you're gonna do that, go get it.\n\n252\n00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:44.800\nDon't bother asking at the store about\nthem, about, oh, we'll get these things.\n\n253\n00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:50.300\nBecause yeah, the provider will say,\nyeah, we need to set that up for you.\n\n254\n00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.800\nWhich they don't, but\nthey'll say we need to set you up for.\n\n255\n00:14:52.800 --> 00:15:00.320\nBecause they're trying to up sell\nyou on services on things like that.\n\n256\n00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.770\nJust do it on your own.\n\n257\n00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:05.440\nIf you wonder why I've been through\nthat gambit before I was like I don't\n\n258\n00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.230\nknow if I want to do that again.\n\n259\n00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:11.380\nSo, anyway that's just a little safety tip\n>> Good to know.\n\n260\n00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.940\n>> with that part of it.\n\n261\n00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:17.940\nSo, just a couple of other\nthings that need to be talked\n\n262\n00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:23.430\nabout is the Pony Express stuff,\nI'll just put them both under that banner.\n\n263\n00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:28.950\nThe Pony Express stuff, how did they\nstack up against Kali Nethunter?\n\n264\n00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:32.050\nSome people will you\nthey're pretty much equal.\n\n265\n00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:35.290\nThey may have their differences between\nthe two but they're pretty much equal.\n\n266\n00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.150\nThe way I look at it is they're not equal.\n\n267\n00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.530\nI look at as a Kali Nethundred device.\n\n268\n00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:40.620\nThey're still new.\n\n269\n00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.200\nThey're still evolving.\n\n270\n00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.161\nIf you want to get\nthe full power out of it,\n\n271\n00:15:44.161 --> 00:15:47.542\nyou're going to have to do the leg work\nand get your hands dirty to do it.\n\n272\n00:15:47.542 --> 00:15:49.446\nDoesn't mean they're not a good device.\n\n273\n00:15:49.446 --> 00:15:52.789\nIt just means that the tool\nset is still evolving.\n\n274\n00:15:52.789 --> 00:15:58.149\nWhere as the Pwn Pad actually has\na much more robust set of tools right\n\n275\n00:15:58.149 --> 00:16:04.030\nout of the box that you just push\nthe image on there and it's ready to go.\n\n276\n00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:07.630\nYou've got a pretty powerful and\nusable device.\n\n277\n00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.835\nSo I look at it as as far,\njust coming off the starting blocks,\n\n278\n00:16:11.835 --> 00:16:16.890\nPwn Pad, Pwn Phone are better or\nbetter positioned as being\n\n279\n00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:21.605\na ready made penetration testing device,\nversus a Kali NetHunter device.\n\n280\n00:16:21.605 --> 00:16:26.440\nBut who knows in maybe a year or\n\n281\n00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:31.480\nso once they've really got a lot of\nwind in their sails with Kali NetHunter.\n\n282\n00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.070\nAnd if that's gonna be the same case,\n\n283\n00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:37.140\nif they haven't bumped it up several\nnotches and got a more powerful device.\n\n284\n00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:42.005\nBut that's obviously my opinion and\nI'm never wrong.\n\n285\n00:16:42.005 --> 00:16:44.015\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, you go with that.\n\n286\n00:16:44.015 --> 00:16:46.890\n[LAUGH] As far as that goes.\n\n287\n00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.720\nAll right, okay, so\n\n288\n00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:54.260\nlet's talk about how you're gonna go about\nthis process of setting this phone up.\n\n289\n00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.670\nThere's some things you gotta do.\n\n290\n00:16:55.670 --> 00:17:00.470\nAll the stuff we talked about\nas far as choosing a device and\n\n291\n00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.420\nall that, very simple compared\nto over Kali NetHunter.\n\n292\n00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.010\nAs far as how you set it up,\nyou gotta have a Linux box ready.\n\n293\n00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.820\nThe Linux box cannot be virtualized.\n\n294\n00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.150\nLet me say it again.\n\n295\n00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.030\nI'll probably say it again in another\nepisode, because I wanna make sure and\n\n296\n00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.610\nI don't wanna get any messages or calls or\nanything else saying, but he said.\n\n297\n00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:20.480\nNo, you can't virtualize it.\n\n298\n00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.740\nI do not care.\n\n299\n00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:27.790\nYou cannot take your micro USB cable,\nplug it into your system and\n\n300\n00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:35.060\nthen share the micro USB connection with\nyour new Pwn Pad and expect it to work.\n\n301\n00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.030\nThe script will fail.\n\n302\n00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:41.600\nOr when it fails, it may not even give you\nan error message, it might just be, no,\n\n303\n00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.610\nyeah, I'm done.\n\n304\n00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:48.140\nAnd you're looking over and you've got\na screen over there that's blank or\n\n305\n00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.260\nit just has, really,\njust a couple of graphics on it.\n\n306\n00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.560\nAnd like, what the heck's going on?\n\n307\n00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.130\nIt says it's complete and it's ready and\nmy new toy's ready for use, but\n\n308\n00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.210\nit's clearly not doing anything.\n\n309\n00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.210\nIt's like clear, what's going on?\n\n310\n00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.480\nNo, it's dead.\n\n311\n00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.630\nNot meaning it's permanent just\nmeans that you're gonna have,\n\n312\n00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:06.380\nprobably get the Nexus Toolkit or\nsomething and try again.\n\n313\n00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.720\nSo it needs to be on a physical system.\n\n314\n00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.260\nAnd so we're gonna talk more about that.\n\n315\n00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.420\nBut do not try to do this\nwith a virtualized Linux.\n\n316\n00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:19.195\nI'm sure someone probably out here,\nsomeone that's really technically\n\n317\n00:18:19.195 --> 00:18:23.400\ninclined, a real Linux geek, nerd,\nwhatever, I could probably say.\n\n318\n00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:28.510\nBut Sean was like I don't care, it's not\nsupported configuration, I don't care.\n\n319\n00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.410\nI'm not trying to be harsh\nabout the whole thing.\n\n320\n00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.530\nIt's like I want this to be as\nsimple as possible for everybody.\n\n321\n00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.890\nIf you wanna try that out, that's on you.\n\n322\n00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:38.900\nThat's not something that\nPony Express supports.\n\n323\n00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.120\nIt's not something\nthat's supported period.\n\n324\n00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.740\nThe one I'm gonna do\nis gonna be supported.\n\n325\n00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.800\nIt's gonna get you there.\n\n326\n00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.380\nWe know it's gonna get you there.\n\n327\n00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.280\nSo let's not go ahead and\ncause us more work.\n\n328\n00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.375\nLet's get to the fun stuff.\n\n329\n00:18:50.375 --> 00:18:53.500\n>> Exactly.\n>> What we're doing is we're gonna install\n\n330\n00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.100\nthe Community Edition, and let me show\nyou what you're gonna need to get for\n\n331\n00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.700\nthe Community Edition.\n\n332\n00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:01.980\nWhat I have on my computer,\nyou can easily Google this too,\n\n333\n00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:06.570\nprobably the easiest way to\nGoogle this is do Pwn Pad, or\n\n334\n00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.590\nPwn Phone Community Edition,\nthey'll get you to the same spot.\n\n335\n00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:17.260\nAnd what you will do is when you get\nthere it's going to bring up a page.\n\n336\n00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:21.410\nIt's going to say, well there's\nPony Express Community Edition.\n\n337\n00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.630\nI click on it saying there's my\nCommunity Edition I want right here.\n\n338\n00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.370\nIt brings up this and says,\noh the Community Edition is now available.\n\n339\n00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:30.060\nTells you what the install\nprocess looks like,\n\n340\n00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.490\nand there's actually going to be a manual\nwith the different, depending on which\n\n341\n00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:38.370\nversion you have, and the manual will\ntell you how the install process works.\n\n342\n00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:39.790\nThey also have a user guide.\n\n343\n00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:41.070\nSo there's your training there.\n\n344\n00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:44.310\nIf you're willing to go through and\nread it and read the stuff in there,\n\n345\n00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.750\nthey tell you how to use the tools.\n\n346\n00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.710\nAnd you need to have\nsome knowledge going in.\n\n347\n00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:49.950\nLet me just be very clear on that.\n\n348\n00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.650\nIf you're gonna read the manual for\nthis thing, the manual was,\n\n349\n00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:57.560\nit was basically someone taking screen\ndumps on one of these devices and\n\n350\n00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.790\npasting them in and then drawing\nlittle arrows on it and saying this.\n\n351\n00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:06.860\nAnd they've got the informations there,\nbut the information is kind of,\n\n352\n00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.810\nit's not polished and\nthere's stuff probably left out.\n\n353\n00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:13.300\nBut it will teach you what you need\nto know and show you what's there.\n\n354\n00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.970\nSo So that's the important thing.\n\n355\n00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:19.630\nI don't necessarily need flashy graphics\nas much as I need the information.\n\n356\n00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:22.920\nSo just be prepared for that.\n\n357\n00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:28.140\nSo you'll go over,\nget the Community Edition and\n\n358\n00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:34.370\nyou will get it for the version of\nthe Pwn Pad or the Pwn Phone Phone.\n\n359\n00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:38.330\nWhatever version of this\nyou have of your tablet or\n\n360\n00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.630\nyour phone, just grab the appropriate one.\n\n361\n00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.443\nFor the Nexus 7, it may be\nthe trickiest one because the Nexus 7,\n\n362\n00:20:44.443 --> 00:20:46.010\nthey have the new one and the old one.\n\n363\n00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.340\nRemember, there's four editions of that.\n\n364\n00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.700\nWiFi and WiFi plus.\n\n365\n00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:56.380\nMobile or 3G, whatever you want to call\nit, they've got two versions of it.\n\n366\n00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.240\nMake sure you get the right one because\nthis installation will take a header on\n\n367\n00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.180\nyou really quick if you get the wrong one\nso we don't want that to happen to you,\n\n368\n00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.140\nso make sure you got the right one.\n\n369\n00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.710\nFortunately, it's before and\nafter for the tablet.\n\n370\n00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.970\nAnd then, the Pwn Phone,\nthere's really only one you can use.\n\n371\n00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:15.810\nYou got a Nexus 5, that's it.\n\n372\n00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:17.510\nThat's really it, so.\n\n373\n00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.610\nAnd they'll tell you how much memory and\n\n374\n00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.810\nall that should have on there,\nbecause to keep you safe.\n\n375\n00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:25.880\nSo if you got all those\nthings satisfied you're done.\n\n376\n00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.290\nYou're ready to go.\n\n377\n00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:30.200\nSo, get the Community Edition,\nyou'll download it,\n\n378\n00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.840\nit's going to be a little\nover a gig to download.\n\n379\n00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:38.090\nYou're going to get your Linux\nnotebook and get that set up, or\n\n380\n00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:41.610\nLinux system, and\nyou're going to get that setup.\n\n381\n00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:43.040\nPlug the things in, and\n\n382\n00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.610\nthen you'll be at the point where\nyou can create your own Pwn Pad.\n\n383\n00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:50.298\nAnd all you have to do after that\nonce you've got the thing created,\n\n384\n00:21:50.298 --> 00:21:53.012\nget your adapters, get your case, and\n\n385\n00:21:53.012 --> 00:21:57.558\ngo start breaking into places\nwhere you don't have permission.\n\n386\n00:21:57.558 --> 00:21:58.630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n387\n00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:00.230\n>> Now Sean do these guys use the same\n\n388\n00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:05.680\nadapters that we saw in our other episodes\nwhere we looked at Kali NetHunter?\n\n389\n00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:10.690\n>> Absolutely, that's another really\ncool thing is that the OTG adapter,\n\n390\n00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.560\nthe Bluetooth adapter,\nthe TP link adapter,\n\n391\n00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.260\nthe Ethernet adapter,\nall those things are 100% the same.\n\n392\n00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.430\nThere's no compatibility issues.\n\n393\n00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:22.494\nIn fact,\nwith the Pwn Pad looks specifically for\n\n394\n00:22:22.494 --> 00:22:24.828\nthe ones that I've showed you here.\n\n395\n00:22:24.828 --> 00:22:27.420\nSo the Kali NetHunter one,\nyou can get away with some other ones.\n\n396\n00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.660\nPwn Pad, they optimize their software.\n\n397\n00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:33.060\nThey made the decision,\nwe can just say, hey you.\n\n398\n00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.290\nThey could have just said, well you\nneed an adapter that does this, and\n\n399\n00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:37.740\nleft it open to you.\n\n400\n00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:42.820\nWhat they did is they said let's\nspecifically optimize the thing for\n\n401\n00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:47.320\nthat environment with these adapters.\n\n402\n00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.420\nSo if you don't have\nthe TP link adapter and\n\n403\n00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:54.220\nthe Sena Bluetooth adapter,\nit's going to throw a fit.\n\n404\n00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.630\nYou'll have to do some customization\n\n405\n00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:01.100\nto a pretty high degree in some cases\nto make ones other then those work.\n\n406\n00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:06.670\nBut you really wouldn't want to because\nin my opinion because they optimize it so\n\n407\n00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:10.060\nwell for those ones that\nthe performance is way up there.\n\n408\n00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.620\nThe ability to the feature\nset way up there.\n\n409\n00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:18.000\nYou can do a lot of neat stuff, so\nyou might as well just use those adapters.\n\n410\n00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.338\nAnd those adapters combined,\nI think combined they're 75,\n\n411\n00:23:22.338 --> 00:23:25.400\ndefinitely under 100 bucks, so why not.\n\n412\n00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:27.650\n>> Very good.\nAll right.\n\n413\n00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.360\nWell, Sean,\na lot of great information there.\n\n414\n00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.650\nI'm excited, I am ready to build\nmy Pwn Pad Community Edition,\n\n415\n00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:36.680\nbut unfortunately we're out of time for\nthis particular episode so\n\n416\n00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.000\nwe're going to have to\ncome back to do that.\n\n417\n00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.640\nSo any parting words for\nour fans out there?\n\n418\n00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.470\n>> Yeah get out there and get your Nexus\n7, Nexus 5 man, we've gotta do this.\n\n419\n00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:46.440\n>> That's what I'm saying,\nlet's get ready to rock and roll.\n\n420\n00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:47.412\n>> Let's light this candle.\n\n421\n00:23:47.412 --> 00:23:50.430\n>> All right, well ladies and gentlemen\nthat's going to do that for this one,\n\n422\n00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:51.830\nwe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n423\n00:23:51.830 -->

00:00:14.770\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.190\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.440\nAnd Sean, we've been talking about\nthe Pwn Pad and the Pwn Phone.\n\n6\n00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.320\nIn this episode, we're gonna take a look\nat actually building our own, downloading\n\n7\n00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.890\nthat Community Edition from Pwnie Express\nand installing it on a Nexus 7 device.\n\n8\n00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.140\nSo Sean, where do we start?\n\n9\n00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.190\n>> Well, there's some, unlike Kali\nNetHunter, there actually is some things\n\n10\n00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.320\nthat do need to be done, over and\nabove what we had to do there.\n\n11\n00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.980\nSo we had to, for example,\non Kali NetHunter we had to\n\n12\n00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.360\nset USB debugging mode.\n\n13\n00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.034\nWe had to do some things on\nthat side with the device.\n\n14\n00:00:56.034 --> 00:00:59.378\nThings don't exist the same way as far as,\nor\n\n15\n00:00:59.378 --> 00:01:04.493\ndon't need to take place the same\nway the Pwn Pads they do over there.\n\n16\n00:01:04.493 --> 00:01:08.770\nThe Pwn Pad does require\nthe setup that has changed a bit.\n\n17\n00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.648\nOne of the big things is,\n\n18\n00:01:10.648 --> 00:01:15.128\nis that we are gonna start with\nthe device in fastboot mode.\n\n19\n00:01:15.128 --> 00:01:17.860\nWhich again, is that pre-boot screen.\n\n20\n00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.370\nSo, we've got that set up\nwhere we're gonna be using.\n\n21\n00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.640\nThen, the other part of it is,\nis that, yeah,\n\n22\n00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.680\nyou have to plug it into your system, but\nwhat's on the other end of that system?\n\n23\n00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.770\nThe other end of that system is\ngoing to be a Ubuntu-based system.\n\n24\n00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.720\nThe one they actually push as being the\nrecommended Ubuntu system is Ubuntu 12.04.\n\n25\n00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.840\nYou can actually do this with\nlater versions if you want, but\n\n26\n00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.200\nthe instructions kind of assume\nthat you have Ubuntu 12.04.\n\n27\n00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.370\nAnd you can go ahead and have ready\naccess to it and have it set up.\n\n28\n00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.110\nAgain, a physical system\nhas to be installed on it.\n\n29\n00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.860\nThis is not virtualized.\n\n30\n00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.648\nSo, what I've got in my system here\nis I actually do have an Ubuntu\n\n31\n00:02:03.648 --> 00:02:10.097\n12.04 system all set up and\nready to go for it to start this process.\n\n32\n00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:12.786\nMy Nexus 7 tablet is set up here,\n\n33\n00:02:12.786 --> 00:02:17.310\nready to have the files pushed\nover to it and ready to go.\n\n34\n00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.817\nSo we're in good shape to get the process\nstarted since everything's configured.\n\n35\n00:02:23.817 --> 00:02:28.325\nBut, let me kinda talk about\nsome things here on Edition,\n\n36\n00:02:28.325 --> 00:02:34.830\nas far as kind of cautions and warnings\nand all that here as things go through.\n\n37\n00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.110\nIs make sure that you've, again,\nbacked up everything on that tablet,\n\n38\n00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.380\nand you are comfortable with\nhaving that thing ready to go.\n\n39\n00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.670\nYou definitely wanna know\nwhat model you possess.\n\n40\n00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.750\nMake sure that when you go\nto the Pwnie Express site,\n\n41\n00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.610\nthe Community Edition,\nthat you know what versions they support.\n\n42\n00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.980\nThey will tell you Nexus 7,\nthey will tell you WiFi or 3G, or both.\n\n43\n00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.160\nThey will tell you how\nmuch memory they support.\n\n44\n00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.190\nIf you're doing the Nexus 5, they'll\ntell you which ones they support there.\n\n45\n00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.150\nMake sure, if you're gonna be buying\nsomething off of eBay or Amazon or\n\n46\n00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.829\nwherever, make sure whatever\ntablet you pick up,\n\n47\n00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.670\nNexus 7 tablet you pick up rather,\nor Nexus 5 device you pick up.\n\n48\n00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.490\nMake sure that it's something that\nsupports those requirements because this\n\n49\n00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.350\nscript is not gonna cut you any slack.\n\n50\n00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.989\nIf it works, great.\n\n51\n00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.350\nIf not, hey, well see you later, too bad.\n\n52\n00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.186\nSo make sure you've got that\nall kinda squared away.\n\n53\n00:03:36.186 --> 00:03:40.698\nOkay, so, right now I know\nthat I have a device here that\n\n54\n00:03:40.698 --> 00:03:44.360\nactually supports the Pwnie Express tools.\n\n55\n00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.460\nSo I can proceed to get that\nthing all set up and ready to go.\n\n56\n00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.220\nSo again, got it set up in fastboot mode.\n\n57\n00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.160\nGot it plugged into my actual system.\n\n58\n00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.560\nI've got my Ubuntu 12.04 system\nall configured and ready to go.\n\n59\n00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.150\nBut, let me tell you, once you install\nUbuntu 12.04, some of the other\n\n60\n00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.670\nsetup that needs to be done before you\ncan start the install has to be done,\n\n61\n00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.120\nnot on the tablet this time, it needs to\nbe done on the specific system itself.\n\n62\n00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.010\nSo, I have actually gone through and\ndone that for you.\n\n63\n00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.640\nSo rather than sitting here\nwatch everything configure and\n\n64\n00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.920\ndownload because it does\ntake a little time.\n\n65\n00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.542\nBut I am gonna walk you\nthrough the process and\n\n66\n00:04:29.542 --> 00:04:32.100\ntalk about what each\nstep of the process is.\n\n67\n00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.342\nSo you understand what's\ngoing on to get this set up,\n\n68\n00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:37.440\nprior to us pushing the files out.\n\n69\n00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.690\nBecause we're actually gonna see the files\nstart to push out to that system.\n\n70\n00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.540\nBut we're not gonna see all\nthe individual setup steps,\n\n71\n00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.560\ncuz those do take some time to do.\n\n72\n00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.000\nSo let's talk about what needs to be done,\nis you need to actually install on Ubuntu,\n\n73\n00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.990\nyou need to install something\ncalled the Android Debug Bridge.\n\n74\n00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.730\nIt's the same deal that we talked\nabout on the Windows side,\n\n75\n00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.790\nthat needs to be installed.\n\n76\n00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.600\nThat's not something\nthat's there by default.\n\n77\n00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.630\nSo, at least not in 12.04,\nit's not there by default.\n\n78\n00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:13.530\nSo you will have to actually\nadd a repository into Linux.\n\n79\n00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.010\nAnd if you're not familiar with Linux,\nrepository\n\n80\n00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.380\nis just a place where you grab\napplications and stuff like that from.\n\n81\n00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.700\nThat's all it is.\n\n82\n00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.928\nWe don't need to get any\nmore fancier than that.\n\n83\n00:05:25.928 --> 00:05:29.932\nI'm sure Linux+ and all that stuff,\nit's got a better description of that, but\n\n84\n00:05:29.932 --> 00:05:32.150\nthat's what we're sticking with for here.\n\n85\n00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.225\nSo, it's just a place\nyou get software from.\n\n86\n00:05:36.225 --> 00:05:39.570\nSo what we're doing here is we\nhave to add a new repository in,\n\n87\n00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.060\nwe'll have to do an update\nwith that repository.\n\n88\n00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.061\nThen we install the Android tools for\nworking with Fastboot and ADB, and\n\n89\n00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:49.023\nthen we have to actually get\nthe Pwnie Express files.\n\n90\n00:05:49.023 --> 00:05:53.040\nThe Pwnie Express files,\nthe Community Edition,\n\n91\n00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.500\nlike I said, that's about,\naround a gig, give or take.\n\n92\n00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:04.200\nSo you'll have to have that but let's\nlook at what we're talking about so far.\n\n93\n00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.691\nWhat I've done to kind of, and\nI'm gonna walk you through this,\n\n94\n00:06:07.691 --> 00:06:11.815\nyou can see they actually have the\ninstructions right here on their site, and\n\n95\n00:06:11.815 --> 00:06:14.340\nlet me kinda bring that up just a bit.\n\n96\n00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.550\nAnd this is talking about what I was\njust doing, is when you go into Ubuntu,\n\n97\n00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.610\nfirst thing you're gonna do is you have\nto install these ADB and Fastboot.\n\n98\n00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.760\nThat allows you to talk to the tablet,\nso this is just what we're seeing here.\n\n99\n00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.052\nAnd this is stuff you\ntype at the terminal.\n\n100\n00:06:30.052 --> 00:06:34.710\nYou can see right here,\nthis is adding a repository.\n\n101\n00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.870\nThen you'll run this command to update\nit so it's got a new repository,\n\n102\n00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.270\ntell it hey update it to\nfind out what's there.\n\n103\n00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.610\nThis is actually installing\nthe tools that we need.\n\n104\n00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.720\nBy the way, every time I've run this tool\non 12.04, just in case you're doing this,\n\n105\n00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.700\nI found out this step actually fails\nif you try to do it as it's written.\n\n106\n00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.680\nWhat you need to do is,\nyou need to run it with that piece.\n\n107\n00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.085\nAnd then after that's done, then take this\npiece, and replace it with this piece.\n\n108\n00:07:02.085 --> 00:07:06.768\nThose are two sets of tools, so do the\nAndroid tools ADB and run that command.\n\n109\n00:07:06.768 --> 00:07:10.400\nAnd then rerun the command\nwith Android Fastboot tools in\n\n110\n00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.300\nplace of the Android tools ADB and\nyou'll be good.\n\n111\n00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.560\nOkay, so safety tip there.\n\n112\n00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:20.199\nNow as far as next steps in this,\nI have downloaded\n\n113\n00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:25.312\nright here,\nthis is the actual Pwn Pad file.\n\n114\n00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:30.075\nAs you can see,\nit's a pretty substantial one.\n\n115\n00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:33.880\nWell, you can see right there,\n1.2 gigs in size like I was telling you.\n\n116\n00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.830\nThat's just a compressed archive.\n\n117\n00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.830\nYou need to get it out of that archive.\n\n118\n00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.860\nIf you're not familiar with\nLinux enough to do this,\n\n119\n00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.710\nthey've actually told you\nright here how to do that.\n\n120\n00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.870\nSo, what I did is I downloaded the file,\n\n121\n00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.580\nor copied off a flash drive,\ninto my Downloads folder.\n\n122\n00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.840\nAnd then,\nI just ran these commands to untar it, and\n\n123\n00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:03.010\nit created this pwnie_img folder.\n\n124\n00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:08.782\nOkay, what you'll have to do is once you\nget in there, this is the actual script\n\n125\n00:08:08.782 --> 00:08:14.146\nright here that's responsible for\nstarting the whole install process.\n\n126\n00:08:14.146 --> 00:08:17.963\nOkay, what you'll have to do is,\nonce you switch to that folder,\n\n127\n00:08:17.963 --> 00:08:20.295\nyou have to flag it as being executable.\n\n128\n00:08:20.295 --> 00:08:22.326\nSo that's what's happening here.\n\n129\n00:08:22.326 --> 00:08:24.334\nSo I've already done that.\n\n130\n00:08:24.334 --> 00:08:29.910\nOkay, now comes the part where we get\nthe [SOUND] drumroll deal going on.\n\n131\n00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.967\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What we're gonna do is,\n\n132\n00:08:31.967 --> 00:08:33.300\nwe got the tablet.\n\n133\n00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:36.411\nSo we're gonna take our tablet,\n\n134\n00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:42.087\nwe're gonna get our micro USB cable and\nplug that bad boy in.\n\n135\n00:08:42.087 --> 00:08:46.595\nOkay now, to get this thing in fastboot\nmode, they tell you right here for\n\n136\n00:08:46.595 --> 00:08:50.959\nfastboot mode hold the power and\nvolume down button simultaneously and\n\n137\n00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:53.240\nit'll take you into fastboot mode.\n\n138\n00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.100\nIf you do that correctly,\n\n139\n00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.860\nit comes up a little green Android there,\nlying on its back like he's hung over.\n\n140\n00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.100\nSo that's what you're gonna see.\n\n141\n00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.910\nAnd it's got the front panel open,\nshowing you the little buttons and\n\n142\n00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:07.370\neverything on there, like a little\nglowing phone buttons on there.\n\n143\n00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.080\nDon't worry, you're not missing anything,\ngoing, I can't see it.\n\n144\n00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.560\nTrust me, if you see the green Android\non there, you're doing pretty well.\n\n145\n00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.194\nAll right, so\nthat's the mode you need to be in,\n\n146\n00:09:16.194 --> 00:09:18.331\nthat's how you get the fastboot mode.\n\n147\n00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:23.073\nThe device has to be powered off, and\nthen you will hold the power button and\n\n148\n00:09:23.073 --> 00:09:26.825\nhold the volume down button and\nit will take you to that.\n\n149\n00:09:26.825 --> 00:09:29.340\nWhat you should see,\nright up here at the top,\n\n150\n00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.390\nyou should see something that says Start.\n\n151\n00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.150\nIt has a green start flag on there.\n\n152\n00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.190\nVery clear, very plain as day.\n\n153\n00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.250\nThat's what you wanna see.\n\n154\n00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.600\nOnce you've got that, that's it.\n\n155\n00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:46.050\nYeah, you just go through, you take your\ncable, you plug it into your device.\n\n156\n00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.449\nSo, I am plugging that thing in,\n\n157\n00:09:48.449 --> 00:09:52.321\nI'm swearing at USB because\nit's unidirectional.\n\n158\n00:09:52.321 --> 00:09:53.360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then,\n\n159\n00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.330\nwhat I'm gonna do is I need to\nstart the installation process.\n\n160\n00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:02.550\nSo, the installation process,\nafter I plugged everything in, it's there.\n\n161\n00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.190\nYou have to start this ADB server.\n\n162\n00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:10.120\nWhat that ADB server is,\nI believe I actually left that\n\n163\n00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.400\ncommand up here for you to see.\n\n164\n00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.347\nDid I not do that?\n\n165\n00:10:17.347 --> 00:10:19.839\nOkay, it doesn't matter 100%.\n\n166\n00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:21.464\nOh, there it is, there's my last command.\n\n167\n00:10:21.464 --> 00:10:22.508\nDuh, last command I ran.\n\n168\n00:10:22.508 --> 00:10:24.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right so,\n\n169\n00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:30.359\nwhat you do is you do the sudo\nto escalate the privileges,\n\n170\n00:10:30.359 --> 00:10:35.320\nand do the Android Debug Bridge\nstart server.\n\n171\n00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.570\nIt starts up the service,\nit's gonna be listening on that port,\n\n172\n00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.700\nwhich is the port that this device\nis gonna be talking to it through.\n\n173\n00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:47.800\nIt's giving me the green light\nthat it's off and running.\n\n174\n00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.579\nSo that leaves us to do our last step,\nwhich is to go through and do our,\n\n175\n00:10:52.579 --> 00:10:54.452\nwell I'll just type it in.\n\n176\n00:10:54.452 --> 00:10:59.547\nIt says right there do sudo ./imagev2.sh,\nand\n\n177\n00:10:59.547 --> 00:11:04.760\nremember, if you type this command in and\nit fails,\n\n178\n00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.630\nand you're looking at it going,\nwhat the heck?\n\n179\n00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:14.080\nI can see that file there, I'm in\nthe right directory, it's not working.\n\n180\n00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.141\nYou probably didn't do that\nchmod to flag it as executable,\n\n181\n00:11:17.141 --> 00:11:18.709\ntherefore it ain't running.\n\n182\n00:11:18.709 --> 00:11:20.498\nOkay, so remember that.\n\n183\n00:11:20.498 --> 00:11:25.901\nAll right, so\neverything is all plugged in, ready to go.\n\n184\n00:11:25.901 --> 00:11:28.918\nWe're gonna pause here for a moment and\n\n185\n00:11:28.918 --> 00:11:34.419\nthink about how much we like the Internet\ngods and pray that this works.\n\n186\n00:11:34.419 --> 00:11:35.733\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then,\n\n187\n00:11:35.733 --> 00:11:39.138\nwhat we're gonna do is we\nare gonna go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n188\n00:11:39.138 --> 00:11:42.472\nAnd it's gonna ask me for\nmy password because we are using sudo and\n\n189\n00:11:42.472 --> 00:11:45.637\nthen it says, okay do you need\nto install the required tools?\n\n190\n00:11:45.637 --> 00:11:49.706\nI typically, just in case, I say yes and\n\n191\n00:11:49.706 --> 00:11:53.670\nit will go ahead and do what it needs to.\n\n192\n00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.955\nIt'll quickly do a quick run through\nto make sure the tools are there and\n\n193\n00:11:56.955 --> 00:11:58.350\neverything's all squared away.\n\n194\n00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:04.660\nSo, hopefully if you've gone through and\nrun everything correctly up to this point\n\n195\n00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:11.160\nand everything's gone the way it\nshould be going, then you're fine.\n\n196\n00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.730\nSo I'll just say,\nyeah I wanna go ahead and continue.\n\n197\n00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.220\nIt goes ahead and\njust starts doing its job.\n\n198\n00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.540\nHey, great, looks like everything is,\neverything's proceeding fine.\n\n199\n00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.978\nSo we can say thank you Internet gods.\n\n200\n00:12:22.978 --> 00:12:23.798\nWe're happy.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n201\n00:12:23.798 --> 00:12:25.548\n>> All right, so what we're doing here,\n\n202\n00:12:25.548 --> 00:12:29.010\nit says which Nexus 7 do you have and do\nyou want to install the Pwn Pad onto it?\n\n203\n00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:30.540\nIt asks you to choose.\n\n204\n00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.175\nSo I happen to have the 16 gig model here,\nso\n\n205\n00:12:34.175 --> 00:12:38.530\nI will just go to choice number 2 and\nsay 16 gigs.\n\n206\n00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.660\nAgain, note the options there.\n\n207\n00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:44.465\n8 gigs, 16 gigs, 32 gig WiFi,\n32 gig WiFi plus GSM.\n\n208\n00:12:44.465 --> 00:12:47.445\nMake sure you know where\nyou are on that spectrum.\n\n209\n00:12:47.445 --> 00:12:52.485\nYou put, this script can be pretty\ntemperamental, I've noticed,\n\n210\n00:12:52.485 --> 00:12:53.925\nif you choose the wrong device.\n\n211\n00:12:53.925 --> 00:12:57.975\nIt won't be oh, you chose the 16 to put\non a 32, sounds like it would work.\n\n212\n00:12:57.975 --> 00:13:00.100\nIt may not, it's gonna say,\nhey wait a minute.\n\n213\n00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.760\nI sense a disturbance in the force.\n\n214\n00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.958\nThis isn't the right resources\nI expect to be present.\n\n215\n00:13:05.958 --> 00:13:10.100\nI have a 16 gig, so I go ahead and\nhit Enter, and it's gonna say, okay,\n\n216\n00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.250\nwell here you go, it's gonna\nwipe all the data on the device.\n\n217\n00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.580\nMm, hey, look what it says.\n\n218\n00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.646\nBackup critical data before continuing.\n\n219\n00:13:18.646 --> 00:13:20.204\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You did do that, right?\n\n220\n00:13:20.204 --> 00:13:25.720\n[LAUGH] So any case,\nI'm gonna go ahead and hit Enter.\n\n221\n00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:29.359\nSays, boot the device into fastboot mode.\n\n222\n00:13:29.359 --> 00:13:32.490\nIt's in fastboot mode, yes it is.\n\n223\n00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.050\nLooks good.\nYou saw it.\n\n224\n00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:37.670\nIt says, go ahead,\nattach it via USB once in fastboot mode.\n\n225\n00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.250\nCheck, we're ready to go.\n\n226\n00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:40.244\nSo now, everything's good.\n\n227\n00:13:40.244 --> 00:13:43.873\nWe should hit Enter and\nit's gonna go ahead and say okay,\n\n228\n00:13:43.873 --> 00:13:46.730\nwell it's checking bootloader unlocked.\n\n229\n00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:50.550\nWell, bootloader,\nwe talked about that with Kali, that deal.\n\n230\n00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.170\nIt goes ahead and unlocks that so\n\n231\n00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:56.390\nit's not bound, it's not gonna\nprevent from installing anything.\n\n232\n00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:58.430\nIt's not bound to a carrier or anything.\n\n233\n00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:59.220\nNow, what it's doing,\n\n234\n00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:03.790\nwhat you're seeing here is it's actually\npushing files out to the device.\n\n235\n00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.123\nThat's what that ADB is\nallowing it to do and\n\n236\n00:14:06.123 --> 00:14:08.280\nthat fastboot tool is allowing it to do.\n\n237\n00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.520\nIt's connecting to the device and\nit's actively pushing all this stuff out.\n\n238\n00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.485\nAnd if you kinda watch this a bit,\nyou can see that it's\n\n239\n00:14:16.485 --> 00:14:22.410\nreformatting partitions on the device and\nwiping caches and stuff like that.\n\n240\n00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:29.520\nAnd it's going to reset it\nup with the Pwn Pad stuff.\n\n241\n00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.390\nOnce it's done, we should be\nable to reboot this device and\n\n242\n00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:36.980\nhave a Pwn Pad device ready to go and\nready for use.\n\n243\n00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.231\nSo, how long does it take?\n\n244\n00:14:39.231 --> 00:14:41.100\nIt kinda depends.\n\n245\n00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:48.950\nYou're seeing it's actually\ngoing fairly quickly here.\n\n246\n00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:52.030\nThe user data always seems to take\na little bit longer because it's\n\n247\n00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:55.600\ndoing a full rewrite there and\neverything and pushing a lot of data.\n\n248\n00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.627\nIt's like, what, 137,000k?\n\n249\n00:14:59.627 --> 00:15:03.780\nSo there you go, finish that,\nget the boot image.\n\n250\n00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.790\nNotice what this also has on here,\nTWRP Recovery.\n\n251\n00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:11.680\nYou just saw that TWRP Recovery\non Kali NetHunter.\n\n252\n00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.180\nSo it's the exact same thing\nit uses over there for\n\n253\n00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.510\nthat special recovery mode\nwhere you can do stuff.\n\n254\n00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:23.100\nIt's doing that thing and\npushing that same guy over there.\n\n255\n00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.460\nAnd as this is happening,\nas the script is happening,\n\n256\n00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.210\nit looks like the script is paused and\nnothing's happening right now.\n\n257\n00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.620\nBut I'm over here looking at the device,\nand\n\n258\n00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.499\nit's already booted into\nanother mode over here.\n\n259\n00:15:36.499 --> 00:15:38.241\nI had the device on fastboot mode,\n\n260\n00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:42.460\nI have not physically touched that device\nsince I flashed up here on screen.\n\n261\n00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.590\nWhat it's doing right now is\nit went through and said okay,\n\n262\n00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:50.550\nwell I pushed this stuff over, it's\npushing more stuff over as you can see,\n\n263\n00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:51.789\nit's doing it pretty quickly.\n\n264\n00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.110\nSo it's going through,\n\n265\n00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:58.850\nit's pushing those things so\nTWRP can use it, can work with it.\n\n266\n00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.880\nCuz TWRP is gonna take these files and\n\n267\n00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:06.530\ninstall them on the device, is gonna\nphysically actually do the install.\n\n268\n00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:10.008\nSo it's taking that,\ngrabbing all these images, the boot image,\n\n269\n00:16:10.008 --> 00:16:12.584\nthe open recovery image,\nplus some other stuff.\n\n270\n00:16:12.584 --> 00:16:15.126\nAnd it's gonna install those\nthings in all those places.\n\n271\n00:16:15.126 --> 00:16:20.640\nAnd once it's done with that, it'll do\nsome crunching and compiling on it.\n\n272\n00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.610\nAnd it will reboot\nthe device back into what\n\n273\n00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:27.840\nshould be a workable system at that point.\n\n274\n00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.150\nI just got this thing, it's just sitting\n\n275\n00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:35.690\nhere just waiting to do the next\nstep as this stuff transfers over.\n\n276\n00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:41.120\nThese files can be a substantial size,\nso do expect that\n\n277\n00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.800\nyou could be here waiting here for\nawhile if you have a slower computer.\n\n278\n00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.960\nWe happen to be blessed with\na faster system here, or\n\n279\n00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.530\na fast, pretty fast system here.\n\n280\n00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:57.780\nAnd not much,\nwe're not pushing a whole ton over, so\n\n281\n00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.786\nit really shouldn't take that long.\n\n282\n00:16:59.786 --> 00:17:02.760\nBut right now, all we have to do,\n\n283\n00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.720\njust like we did with Kali NetHunter,\nis just wait.\n\n284\n00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.200\nJust relax, kick back and wait for\n\n285\n00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.709\nthe thing to finish, and end of the day,\nyou should have a Pwn Pad.\n\n286\n00:17:14.709 --> 00:17:19.550\nA fully ready to go Pwn Pad,\nwhich is the objective here.\n\n287\n00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:22.450\nAt that point, post installation tasks,\n\n288\n00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:29.420\nconfiguration, making sure you have\nthe adapters, stuff we'll talk about.\n\n289\n00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.728\nAnd we're in good shape.\n\n290\n00:17:31.728 --> 00:17:36.651\n>> All right, so maybe not as wizard\ndriven as we saw with Kali NetHunter,\n\n291\n00:17:36.651 --> 00:17:39.207\nbut really all in all, not that bad.\n\n292\n00:17:39.207 --> 00:17:42.810\nAnd we had to get it installation of\nLinux, which isn't too terribly difficult.\n\n293\n00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:47.300\nHad to run a few commands but in the end,\nnot bad at all as far as the install goes.\n\n294\n00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.240\n>> Yeah, it actually does seem to be,\nyou look at the sequence of commands and\n\n295\n00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.920\neverything that we saw in that document.\n\n296\n00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.700\nI may have read them off to you and\nI did them ahead of time so\n\n297\n00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.740\nyou didn't have to sit here and wait.\n\n298\n00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:05.220\nBut even if I did do that, and\npresumably some of you are gonna do this,\n\n299\n00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.280\nall you gotta do is follow those\ncommands in here and pop them in.\n\n300\n00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.120\nIt's very little effort to do,\nis the way I look at it.\n\n301\n00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:19.630\nJust go ahead, plug it in, or run those\ncommands, put the stuff in fastboot mode,\n\n302\n00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:25.495\nrun the script, and go enjoy a long\nlunch or a snack or something like that.\n\n303\n00:18:25.495 --> 00:18:29.710\nCome back, and then after you're done,\nenjoy your new Pwn Pad.\n\n304\n00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:31.420\n>> Very good.\nAll right, well tell you what Sean,\n\n305\n00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.010\na lot of great information there.\n\n306\n00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:36.030\nAt the end of the day,\nwe've got our own Pwn Pad.\n\n307\n00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:41.034\nAnything else you wanna leave with our\nviewers before we wrap this one up?\n\n308\n00:18:41.034 --> 00:18:42.180\n>> Not really.\n\n309\n00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.593\nJust at this point, it's just\na little bit of a waiting game, or\n\n310\n00:18:45.593 --> 00:18:47.820\njust is a waiting game for this to finish.\n\n311\n00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.760\nThe script has it in its hands now.\n\n312\n00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.187\nSo, just hang around and\nwait for it to be done.\n\n313\n00:18:54.187 --> 00:18:55.314\n>> Very good.\n\n314\n00:18:55.314 --> 00:18:57.500\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n315\n00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.040\nWe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n316\n00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.167\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n317\n00:19:01.167 --> 00:19:02.060\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n318\n00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.128\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n319\n00:19:03.128 --> 00:19:09.759\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.370\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.730\nAnd Sean, in this episode,\nwe're gonna be taking a look at well,\n\n5\n00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.800\nwe're gonna finish our process that\nwe started in a previous episode.\n\n6\n00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.850\nSo if you missed that one,\nmake sure you go back and check it out.\n\n7\n00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.327\nWe are creating our own Pwn Pad.\n\n8\n00:00:29.327 --> 00:00:32.604\nPwnie Express gives us the ability\nto download their Community Edition.\n\n9\n00:00:32.604 --> 00:00:35.157\nWe can get the appropriate\nhardware that's supported.\n\n10\n00:00:35.157 --> 00:00:38.977\nWe can start putting those together and\nmake our own Pwn Pad, and\n\n11\n00:00:38.977 --> 00:00:41.110\nthat's exactly what we did.\n\n12\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.770\nSo Sean, yesterday when we left off\nwe had gotten the whole process done.\n\n13\n00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.160\nWe walked through the entire thing.\n\n14\n00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.370\nHad everything it loaded up.\n\n15\n00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.440\nBut then it's a little bit of\na lengthy process to actually get that\n\n16\n00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.653\nCommunity Edition of\na Pwn Pad transferred over.\n\n17\n00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:58.979\nSo today we're gonna take a look at\nwhat transpired during that process and\n\n18\n00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:00.291\nwhat we ended up with.\n\n19\n00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:01.188\nRight?\n\n20\n00:01:01.188 --> 00:01:05.420\n>> Exactly, so yeah,\nin the previous episode\n\n21\n00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.790\nwe started the process of\ngetting everything installed.\n\n22\n00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.730\nWe got our Ubuntu machine ready,\nwe loaded the tools on there.\n\n23\n00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.490\nWe got the Pwnie Express Community\nedition, downloaded and\n\n24\n00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.690\nexpanded and everything.\n\n25\n00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.560\nGot all the settings everything set up and\nthen just started the process of pushing\n\n26\n00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.378\neverything over to the tablets,\nconvert a tablet into a Pwn Pad.\n\n27\n00:01:30.378 --> 00:01:33.460\nSo, that does take some time and\nit did take some time,\n\n28\n00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.770\nwhen we left you in the previous episode\nyou saw that process start to go.\n\n29\n00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.610\nYou saw it on my screen,\nyou saw it start to kinda tick through,\n\n30\n00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.630\nand stuff getting pushed\nover that will take a while.\n\n31\n00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.790\nAs we were saying in that episode.\n\n32\n00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.380\nAnd how long it's going\nto take is going to vary.\n\n33\n00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.345\nHere, we just, when we finish\nthat episode, we just let it sit.\n\n34\n00:01:56.345 --> 00:02:01.290\n[LAUGH] Went about doing other things,\nwe just, okay, we'll see you later.\n\n35\n00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.620\nAnd that's probably\nthe best way to treat it.\n\n36\n00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.790\nNow once that's done, if everything\ngoes correctly, once it's done,\n\n37\n00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.640\nyou should have a nice new\nPwn Pad staring you in the face.\n\n38\n00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.960\nIt should still be powered on.\n\n39\n00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.856\nYou should just be able to wake up\nthe screen or whatever and see the nice\n\n40\n00:02:21.856 --> 00:02:28.140\nPwn Pad or Pwnie Express logo staring\nback at you and ready for the next phase.\n\n41\n00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.240\nWhat I like to do though\nbefore I start my full thing\n\n42\n00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.810\nof playing around with this\nnew toy that I've set up.\n\n43\n00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.530\nIs I do like to take a quick glance at\n\n44\n00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.710\nwhat is on my computer that I\npush all the stuff over with.\n\n45\n00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.630\nNow, I'll just tell you what you're\nlooking for, because I could tell you,\n\n46\n00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.170\nI mean, I'm looking at my laptop here and\nthere's just a bunch of text on there.\n\n47\n00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.230\nBut let me tell you what\nyou're looking for.\n\n48\n00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.330\nWhen it's pushing stuff over,\nyou're gonna see lines and\n\n49\n00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.554\nlines of pushing this file over,\npushing this file over, and\n\n50\n00:03:01.554 --> 00:03:04.418\nit will tell you explicitly\nthat's what it's doing.\n\n51\n00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:09.266\nI like to, when I'm doing this as part of\nmy, I guess you want to call it your pre\n\n52\n00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:13.468\npost-installation test,\nif you really want to mess everyone up.\n\n53\n00:03:13.468 --> 00:03:16.369\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's before I start digging into\n\n54\n00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:17.194\nthe device,\n\n55\n00:03:17.194 --> 00:03:23.080\nI take a glance through those lines to see\nif there's any errors popping up in there.\n\n56\n00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.710\nThere shouldn't be any errors whatsoever.\n\n57\n00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.230\nIf you do see those and you do look\nover and see if the Pwn Pad is complete.\n\n58\n00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.130\nThat is, if it did complete\nsuccessfully with an error on screen,\n\n59\n00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.350\nsometimes it will, sometimes you'll see an\nerror spit up on screen, it'll say okay,\n\n60\n00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.350\nit didn't consider it a non-fatal\nerror but kept going.\n\n61\n00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.240\nYou still are gonna be\nlacking something over here.\n\n62\n00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.448\nSomething happened that didn't get filed,\ndidn't get pushed over,\n\n63\n00:03:49.448 --> 00:03:51.350\nit got corrupted or something.\n\n64\n00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.920\nGenerally that doesn't happen.\n\n65\n00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.690\nI've done this plenty of times.\n\n66\n00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.930\nI pretty much have not had that\nhappen really all that often.\n\n67\n00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.780\nWell it's happened now and then but\nit's not a common occurrence.\n\n68\n00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.014\nI'll tell you something that\ncould be a little trickier for\n\n69\n00:04:09.014 --> 00:04:11.893\nyou and you gotta pay attention to this,\n\n70\n00:04:11.893 --> 00:04:16.988\nis that I did mention prior that you're\ngonna do this on a physical box.\n\n71\n00:04:16.988 --> 00:04:21.284\nYou're gonna have a PC that\nhas Ubuntu installed on it and\n\n72\n00:04:21.284 --> 00:04:24.787\nlink your Pwn Pad and\nyour system together.\n\n73\n00:04:24.787 --> 00:04:28.610\nI told you to not do this on a virtual\nsystem, if you decide to go that route,\n\n74\n00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.222\nbe prepared that it will not\ngenerate errors in a lot\n\n75\n00:04:31.222 --> 00:04:33.749\nof cases it will just say okay,\nI pushed it over.\n\n76\n00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:38.175\nAnd you'll try to be diagnosing problems\nand figure out why stuff isn't working\n\n77\n00:04:38.175 --> 00:04:42.418\nwhen there's no errors there, or\nany conclusive errors there in some case.\n\n78\n00:04:42.418 --> 00:04:45.843\nSo be aware of that, but\nyou shouldn't be doing that anyway.\n\n79\n00:04:45.843 --> 00:04:46.645\n>> Okay.\nSo remember,\n\n80\n00:04:46.645 --> 00:04:50.283\nto make sure we're not gonna get any\nlack of errors, I mean you should\n\n81\n00:04:50.283 --> 00:04:54.314\nsee if there's any problems,\nI hope you don't see any errors on-screen.\n\n82\n00:04:54.314 --> 00:05:00.425\nBut to avoid any problems,\ndon't use virtualization with the this.\n\n83\n00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:03.625\nVirtualization, as we were\nsaying in a previous episode,\n\n84\n00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:05.738\nit's not only not supported for this.\n\n85\n00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:09.959\nAnd Pwnie Express is pretty verbose if\nyou will about that saying this is not\n\n86\n00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:13.850\nsupported during this install\nin a virtual environment.\n\n87\n00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.050\nSo, they're telling you don't do this.\n\n88\n00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.284\nIf you do decide to really\nkinda press on and do that,\n\n89\n00:05:19.284 --> 00:05:23.048\nbe prepared for the fact that it\nmay very well not work at all.\n\n90\n00:05:23.048 --> 00:05:27.963\nYou might get lucky and say, oh,\nI beat the odds or whatever.\n\n91\n00:05:27.963 --> 00:05:33.067\nBut you might very well get a situation\nwhere there's no error generated during\n\n92\n00:05:33.067 --> 00:05:38.580\nthe installation process but you still end\nup having stuff missing on your Pwn Pad.\n\n93\n00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.574\nSo you have a partially\nfunctional Pwn Pad.\n\n94\n00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:44.040\nOr have a Pwn Pad that\ndoesn't work at all,\n\n95\n00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.760\nit's just a blank screen, seen it happen.\n\n96\n00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.350\nAnd that means you're gonna have to go\nthrough and do some diagnostics there to\n\n97\n00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.670\nfigure out what's going on which\nis just completely unnecessary.\n\n98\n00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.790\nJust stick with using it on a physical\nmachine and make it easier on yourself.\n\n99\n00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.500\nAnd I guess it's worth adding,\nif you're not willing to commit fully to\n\n100\n00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.120\ninstalling Ubuntu on a system.\n\n101\n00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.610\nYou just don't have one,\nyou can wipe clean to do this.\n\n102\n00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.000\nNo one said you had to.\n\n103\n00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.120\nYou can make a USB installation\nof Ubuntu and make it persistent.\n\n104\n00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.690\nPlug it in, boot off of that,\nand dev all the files.\n\n105\n00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:21.960\nDo all the set up here.\n\n106\n00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.750\nAnd use that, just for this process.\n\n107\n00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.133\nSo, do keep that in mind\nif that virtualization,\n\n108\n00:06:27.133 --> 00:06:30.448\nif that's the reason why you're\ndeciding to go to virtualization.\n\n109\n00:06:30.448 --> 00:06:34.858\nBut anyway, we'll take that out of the\npicture right now, what's gonna happen is\n\n110\n00:06:34.858 --> 00:06:38.827\nthat you're gonna check again to make\nsure there's no errors popping up,\n\n111\n00:06:38.827 --> 00:06:40.354\neverything's completed.\n\n112\n00:06:40.354 --> 00:06:45.084\nOnce the installation script has pushed\neverything over to the Pwn Pad what\n\n113\n00:06:45.084 --> 00:06:49.170\nyou're gonna see is,\nyou're just gonna see basically nothing.\n\n114\n00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.056\nIt's gonna put on a screen\nsaying don't touch anything,\n\n115\n00:06:52.056 --> 00:06:55.090\nthe Pwn Pad is basically\ntaking care of itself now.\n\n116\n00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.850\nBecause what happened is all the files\nwill get pushed over here, it will do its\n\n117\n00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:03.650\ncrunching and all that on it, and\nget it ready and compile it and all that.\n\n118\n00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.490\nAnd when it's done,\nit will bring itself up.\n\n119\n00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.430\nYou shouldn't have to touch anything.\n\n120\n00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.090\nIn fact, don't touch anything.\n\n121\n00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.270\nLeave it alone.\n\n122\n00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.800\nAnd so let it just bring itself back up.\n\n123\n00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.950\nDon't touch the computer.\n\n124\n00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.620\nDon't touch the Pwn Pad and just wait.\n\n125\n00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.110\nDo expect you could be looking\nat about a half hour on average.\n\n126\n00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.660\nThat tends to be what it takes to\nget a Pwn Pad installation complete.\n\n127\n00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.860\nOnce you start the script,\nit's gonna be about a half hour.\n\n128\n00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.100\nMaybe it's gonna be over, maybe less,\nbut just around a half hour.\n\n129\n00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.430\nSo it's not something that's instantaneous\nat all, but it's about a half hour.\n\n130\n00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.690\nWhat could change that depends\non the speed of the system.\n\n131\n00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.870\nHow new the device is\nyou're pushing it to.\n\n132\n00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.904\nIf it has a stronger processor so\non and so forth.\n\n133\n00:07:49.904 --> 00:07:54.279\nBut right now, where we are,\ncoming into this,\n\n134\n00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:58.458\nthat's all that stuff happened off air,\nso.\n\n135\n00:07:58.458 --> 00:08:02.154\nYou didn't have to sit there and wait for\nit to happen, and watch your watch and\n\n136\n00:08:02.154 --> 00:08:03.750\neverything, doing this.\n\n137\n00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:08.750\nSo, we've got to a point where\neverything is completed successfully.\n\n138\n00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:13.470\nI can look over at our at our Pwn Pad and\nsee that yes,\n\n139\n00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:19.290\nit's staring back at us, it's complete and\nready for the next phase of it's life.\n\n140\n00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:23.160\nSo, we could take a look at what\nthat finished process looks like.\n\n141\n00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.330\nThere is your, or\nthere is my brand new Pwn Pad.\n\n142\n00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.000\nSo you can see this,\nI haven't touched anything on here,\n\n143\n00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.650\nthis is a brand spanking new installation.\n\n144\n00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.670\nIt's ready to use.\n\n145\n00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:42.730\nPost installation tasks\nthat you want to consider,\n\n146\n00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:48.290\nis you may want to set up\nyour wireless at this point.\n\n147\n00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.000\nThis does have a wireless\nconnection in it, as we know.\n\n148\n00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.560\nThat has not been set up.\n\n149\n00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.040\nI will set that up as needed.\n\n150\n00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.040\nOther things that are on here,\nyou're gonna want to add in your\n\n151\n00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.870\nGoogle Play account,\nif you're gonna be doing that.\n\n152\n00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.410\nAnd I'm gonna tell you, if you're gonna be\nusing these, and the same thing goes for\n\n153\n00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:09.920\nKali NetHunter.\n\n154\n00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.560\nOne of the things,\nyou can use an existing Google account.\n\n155\n00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.350\nBut if you're gonna do something like\nthis, I found it incredibly easy to\n\n156\n00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:25.400\nuse a Google account that's just for\nthis device.\n\n157\n00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.030\nAnd the reason for that is, is numerous.\n\n158\n00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.920\nFirst of all, it's something that you\ncan link directly to that device.\n\n159\n00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.980\nSo that makes it very handy, if you\nlink it specifically to that device.\n\n160\n00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:36.700\nI mean heck its free,\n\n161\n00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.630\nwhy not set up another one make\nit easy on yourself, right?\n\n162\n00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.580\nYou can link it specifically\nto this device.\n\n163\n00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:46.271\nAnd if you start installing utilities out\nof the Google Play Store, which there\n\n164\n00:09:46.271 --> 00:09:49.823\nare quite a few up there that could help\nyou and be great enhancements to this.\n\n165\n00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:55.021\nBecause I'm thinking stuff\nthat post installation wise\n\n166\n00:09:55.021 --> 00:10:00.867\nI look at stuff like Microsoft has\ntheir Word stuff available for\n\n167\n00:10:00.867 --> 00:10:04.490\nthis, so you can get those for this.\n\n168\n00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.880\nYou may want to get a PDF reader for that.\n\n169\n00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.170\nYou can get those.\n\n170\n00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.670\nThere's different networking\ntools you might find have helped.\n\n171\n00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:14.730\nDryDroid I was talking about in another\nepisode, that's available up there.\n\n172\n00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.529\nThere's all sorts of tools that you can\nuse for Root, that you might find helpful.\n\n173\n00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.120\nAnd I'm not saying that you won't\nhave to go outside of Google Play,\n\n174\n00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.080\njust saying that there are some good tools\non there that you might wanna get if you\n\n175\n00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:27.800\npoke around.\n\n176\n00:10:28.888 --> 00:10:33.890\nNow, if you set up a Google Play\naccount specifically for\n\n177\n00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:36.580\nthis device, and you log into it and\n\n178\n00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:41.160\nthen you start downloading those tools and\ninstalling it on here.\n\n179\n00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.320\nIf you ever have to blow this device away,\n\n180\n00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.770\nwhich presumably you're\ngonna have to at some point.\n\n181\n00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.160\nIn fact I'll show you a really\neasy way to reset this device.\n\n182\n00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.430\nIf you ever have to blow this one away, if\nyou have a Google Play account linked to\n\n183\n00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:58.540\nit, all you have to do is in that Google\nPlay account, open up the Google Play app\n\n184\n00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:04.020\non this device, and just click inside\nthere saying look at all your apps.\n\n185\n00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.990\nYou just open up the device,\nlook at your account and say all apps.\n\n186\n00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.470\nIt'll show you a list of all the apps\nthat you've installed with that account.\n\n187\n00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.570\nAnd so\neven if they're not currently on there,\n\n188\n00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.500\nsay these are the ones that you\ninstalled from this account in the past.\n\n189\n00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:21.480\nIf you set up something specifically for\nthat tablet, heck, you blow it away and\n\n190\n00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.930\nthose apps go bye bye, all you have to do\nis link up your Google Play account again.\n\n191\n00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.867\nWhich is simple and just tap,\ntap, tap, install and\n\n192\n00:11:28.867 --> 00:11:31.490\nthey'll go right back\nout to the device again.\n\n193\n00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.564\nSo you don't have to go\nhunt those things down or\n\n194\n00:11:33.564 --> 00:11:36.690\nanything else,\nyou can make your life a lot easier.\n\n195\n00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.080\nAnd that's exactly the type of thing I do.\n\n196\n00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.590\nAnd another added bonus, Pwn Pad.\n\n197\n00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.930\nWe talked about Kali NetHunter\nin our other episodes.\n\n198\n00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.678\nIf you can link that same Google Play\naccount to both devices, and\n\n199\n00:11:48.678 --> 00:11:52.766\nyou can have the apps that you install\nthe Google Play store, go back and\n\n200\n00:11:52.766 --> 00:11:54.417\nforth between both of them.\n\n201\n00:11:54.417 --> 00:11:57.905\nSo it's a nice post installation that\ncan make your life a lot easier if you\n\n202\n00:11:57.905 --> 00:11:58.590\nthink ahead.\n\n203\n00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.320\nThat's something I use personally, and\nhighly recommend you use personally.\n\n204\n00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.910\nSo just one you can file away for\nlater use.\n\n205\n00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.840\nSo that's one post installation task,\nthat you're gonna have.\n\n206\n00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:22.690\nSo set up your network, set up your\nGoogle Play account if you have that.\n\n207\n00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.810\nAny other customizations, if you wanna\ninstall any other tools on there,\n\n208\n00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.400\nthat would be the time to go ahead and\ndo this.\n\n209\n00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.770\nAnd other than that,\n\n210\n00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:34.410\nyou pretty much at this point\nhave a device that's ready to go.\n\n211\n00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:40.634\nNow, the thing you're gonna notice in\nhere when you look at the Pwn Pad,\n\n212\n00:12:40.634 --> 00:12:45.785\nis the Pwn Pad has quite a few\ntools on it, compared to Kali.\n\n213\n00:12:45.785 --> 00:12:49.000\nKali, the tools you just have\nto click a few buttons and\n\n214\n00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.860\nmore start appearing, and you can do that.\n\n215\n00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:58.330\nThis one has quite a few installed, but\none of the things I really like about\n\n216\n00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:04.350\nthis one is the fact that it's got these\nthings all grouped by default on here.\n\n217\n00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:08.220\nIs that you can open it up and\nhave them grouped by specific tools,\n\n218\n00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.970\nwhich is pretty nice.\n\n219\n00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:14.220\nYou have these are network tools.\n\n220\n00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.910\nThese are your special attack tools, and\n\n221\n00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:19.350\nsome pretty powerful stuff\non there by the way people.\n\n222\n00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:23.575\nI mean this one right here,\nthat's Metasploit, so\n\n223\n00:13:23.575 --> 00:13:30.212\nMetasploit's running right here on this\ndevice, so we have other attack tools.\n\n224\n00:13:30.212 --> 00:13:35.038\nThere's Ettercap, we talked about\nthat in our ethical hacking class,\n\n225\n00:13:35.038 --> 00:13:39.005\nand there's the social\nengineering tool kit right there.\n\n226\n00:13:39.005 --> 00:13:44.365\nSo they are already coming with\nsome serious fire power in here.\n\n227\n00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:51.950\nWireless stuff that we have, we have\na whole range of these things in here.\n\n228\n00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:55.658\nYou can turn this thing into\nan access point if you want.\n\n229\n00:13:55.658 --> 00:14:00.880\nThere's Kismet, Kismet is great for\ndetecting wireless networks.\n\n230\n00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.080\nIt has that.\n\n231\n00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.805\nThere's cracking tools on here,\nhere's some other one.\n\n232\n00:14:05.805 --> 00:14:08.350\nThere's something else in here\nthat's kind of interesting.\n\n233\n00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.620\nThey have special Bluetooth attack tools.\n\n234\n00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.650\nIt's one of the few devices that has that.\n\n235\n00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:19.330\nIt can use that Bluetooth adapter that I\nflashed up here a couple times saying,\n\n236\n00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:23.630\nhey, check this out, this is that\nlittle Bluetooth industrial adapter.\n\n237\n00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:27.870\nThis thing can also use a tool\ncalled the Ubertooth one,\n\n238\n00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:32.810\nand it has a tool built into it right\nthere, that is used specifically for\n\n239\n00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:36.950\nworking with the Ubertooth\nwhich it's a higher end,\n\n240\n00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:40.860\nif you will, Bluetooth attack tool.\n\n241\n00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.810\nIt's about ye big, you can look\nit up online, it's about ye big.\n\n242\n00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.760\nIt's just a circuit board with\na USB adapter on the end.\n\n243\n00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.650\nAnd you can screw your\nown antenna into it.\n\n244\n00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:53.130\nWhich they provide one, but\nyou can get other ones that could\n\n245\n00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.970\nadjust the properties of it a bit,\nand the range of it a bit.\n\n246\n00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.940\nSo they don't provide that.\n\n247\n00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.770\nIf you go to Pwnie Express,\nthey don't provide that either.\n\n248\n00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.140\nSo you have to actually buy that,\nand it's about a 100 bucks.\n\n249\n00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.990\nIf you're really gonna get\ninto Bluetooth hacking,\n\n250\n00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:12.060\nthat's pretty much the type of device you\nwant in addition to what the other one is.\n\n251\n00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.800\nSo you have some really kind of\ninteresting stuff there right\n\n252\n00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.470\nout of the box on this,\nthat you just get as part of the deal.\n\n253\n00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:24.630\nSo we've looked around,\nwe've seen that their tools are on there.\n\n254\n00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.940\nWe've got things configured.\n\n255\n00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.130\nIf you want to do other stuff on there,\n\n256\n00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:32.620\nas far as in addition to loading your\nown tools on there, you can do that.\n\n257\n00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.270\nYou want to set up your\naccount you can do that,\n\n258\n00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.430\nif you want to start backing up\nstuff on there, some people do that.\n\n259\n00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:41.973\nIf you want to get in and do that.\n\n260\n00:15:41.973 --> 00:15:46.925\nThings that I want to mention right here,\nis why we're talking about this for\n\n261\n00:15:46.925 --> 00:15:48.306\npost installation.\n\n262\n00:15:48.306 --> 00:15:50.602\nIs if you're looking ahead,\nand thinking well,\n\n263\n00:15:50.602 --> 00:15:54.003\nI want to keep track of all these\nsettings in here, it's a clean install.\n\n264\n00:15:54.003 --> 00:15:58.654\nSo just in case I ever have to go back,\nsometimes some people look ahead and\n\n265\n00:15:58.654 --> 00:15:59.262\ndo that.\n\n266\n00:15:59.262 --> 00:16:02.870\nThis is one of the cool things\nthat I like about the Pwn Pad.\n\n267\n00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:07.517\nThe whole installation process we\njust went through where we waited for\n\n268\n00:16:07.517 --> 00:16:11.164\nthings to get done to make a nice,\nclean device, okay?\n\n269\n00:16:11.164 --> 00:16:12.920\nYou're perfectly welcome do that.\n\n270\n00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:18.940\nIn some cases, you may need to do that\nagain if the device gets really messed up.\n\n271\n00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.200\nBut one of the things I think is really,\n\n272\n00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.940\nreally neat about this is\nright there in the middle.\n\n273\n00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.920\nYou can't see it on screen too well,\n\n274\n00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.630\ncuz the icon's black and\nwe got a black background.\n\n275\n00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:34.080\nBut this button right here,\nthat's the Factory Reset button.\n\n276\n00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.430\nWhat will happen if you tap\nthat Factory Reset button,\n\n277\n00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.610\nit's gonna do a factory reset.\n\n278\n00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.250\nNo big surprise, right?\n\n279\n00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.180\nIf you hit that button,\n\n280\n00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.290\nit will actually roll the thing back\nto the configuration it is right now.\n\n281\n00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:47.850\n>> Not back to the original\nNexus 7 configuration, but\n\n282\n00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:52.280\nback to the default Pwnie Express or\nthe Community Edition install.\n\n283\n00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.110\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n284\n00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.100\nIt'll roll it right back to the way\nit is at this point in time.\n\n285\n00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:00.223\nIt will not roll it back to the way it\nwas when it shipped from the factory,\n\n286\n00:17:00.223 --> 00:17:03.349\nit's gonna ship from the factory\nas a regular device.\n\n287\n00:17:03.349 --> 00:17:06.097\nIt won't go back to a previous life,\n\n288\n00:17:06.097 --> 00:17:11.080\ngo back to the way it was when\nyou had the way it is right now.\n\n289\n00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.755\nThat's also another reason\nwhy that you want to link or\n\n290\n00:17:14.755 --> 00:17:19.360\nprobably get your own Gmail account or\nsorry, Google Play account,\n\n291\n00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:23.260\nwell same thing, linked up to this and\nget your tools on there.\n\n292\n00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:26.308\nBecause when you hit that, it's just\ngonna go back to what's on there now,\n\n293\n00:17:26.308 --> 00:17:29.770\nthat Pwnie Express built into this thing.\n\n294\n00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:34.200\nIf you want those other things in there,\nwell, then you better get them linked up\n\n295\n00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.340\nto that account, or if you've\npulled them off the black market or\n\n296\n00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.540\nsomething like that, make sure you\nhave them on a flash drive someplace.\n\n297\n00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.540\nAnd then once you've done that,\n\n298\n00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:48.660\nthen go ahead and you could do your\nfactory reset to your heart's content.\n\n299\n00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.580\nRelink your account and go click,\nclick, click through your apps and\n\n300\n00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:52.860\nlet it install.\n\n301\n00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:56.934\nSo pretty nice and pretty easy to do.\n\n302\n00:17:56.934 --> 00:18:01.450\nI found this one, I found that\nFactory Reset button to be a godsend.\n\n303\n00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:05.608\nSome of these devices that you use for\nthis, once you go through and mess it up,\n\n304\n00:18:05.608 --> 00:18:09.584\nyou pretty much gonna have to go through\nand restore it off a default image.\n\n305\n00:18:09.584 --> 00:18:10.873\nI don't have to do that here.\n\n306\n00:18:10.873 --> 00:18:15.210\nThey've actually put that in there for\nthe purposes that we're talking about.\n\n307\n00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:21.280\nIf you use this, let's switch it a bit\nfrom post-installation to post-job task.\n\n308\n00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.544\nAfter you finish working with a client,\nthat could be the button that you hit\n\n309\n00:18:24.544 --> 00:18:27.149\nafter you've worked with a client and\ngot everything done.\n\n310\n00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:31.131\nPop, you hit that and\nlet it do it's dirty work or whatever.\n\n311\n00:18:31.131 --> 00:18:37.770\nAnd it will go ahead and get everything\nback up to where it's supposed to be.\n\n312\n00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.790\nThis also,\njust one other post-installation task, and\n\n313\n00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.382\ntask that you should\ntake on a regular basis,\n\n314\n00:18:43.382 --> 00:18:49.250\nthe Pwnie Express stuff does have\nit's own stuff to update it as well.\n\n315\n00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:53.120\nThere's an icon in here that you\ncan use to actually go through and\n\n316\n00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.265\ntell it to do all its updates and\neverything for you.\n\n317\n00:18:56.265 --> 00:19:00.900\nSo you can always make sure\nyou're up to speed with that.\n\n318\n00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:06.870\nAnd that's in addition to the Android\nupdates, which just a little safety tip,\n\n319\n00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.980\nthis one will say oh,\nyou're missing some Android updates.\n\n320\n00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:10.602\nI've seen it do it.\n\n321\n00:19:10.602 --> 00:19:12.020\nWhen you're missing some Android updates,\n\n322\n00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.610\ntry to avoid installing those\nuntil you have checked them out.\n\n323\n00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:18.120\nSome of those things you install\nwill break the actual device.\n\n324\n00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.250\n>> And we do have the ability\nto back it up so we could\n\n325\n00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:26.020\nget all of these extra apps that we want\nfrom whatever source we're talking about,\n\n326\n00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.140\ngo through and\nmake sure each one of them works.\n\n327\n00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.110\nAnd I'm assuming we still do have to some\nof the things, like with Metasploit,\n\n328\n00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.810\nwe gotta update the database,\nor some of those.\n\n329\n00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:37.600\nThen we can make a backup, and then after\na job, we just restore that backup,\n\n330\n00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.980\nnot have to reinstall all of those apps.\n\n331\n00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:45.460\n>> As far as the ones from Google Play,\nyou would have to reinstall those.\n\n332\n00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.970\nIt shouldn't really take that long.\n\n333\n00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:48.508\nYou can probably write a script for\n\n334\n00:19:48.508 --> 00:19:50.903\nit I'm guessing if you wanted\nto ever try it for that.\n\n335\n00:19:50.903 --> 00:19:52.380\n>> Even if they're part of our backup?\n\n336\n00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:56.205\n>> Well if you're doing a backup\noutside of the factory reset, okay,\n\n337\n00:19:56.205 --> 00:19:57.758\nI see where you're going.\n\n338\n00:19:57.758 --> 00:20:01.627\nIf you do the backup outside that\nthen yeah, then you could do that.\n\n339\n00:20:01.627 --> 00:20:06.438\nBut if you just, if you haven't done that\nand you do the factory reset, the factory\n\n340\n00:20:06.438 --> 00:20:11.144\nreset is just for the factory stuff, so\nyeah, I see what you're talking about.\n\n341\n00:20:11.144 --> 00:20:14.905\n>> Right, that would be my thing with\nmost of my PCs, once I get it installed,\n\n342\n00:20:14.905 --> 00:20:18.729\nget all my updates done, get all my\napps installed, downloaded from here,\n\n343\n00:20:18.729 --> 00:20:19.910\nthere, everywhere.\n\n344\n00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.827\nGet everything configured\ntake that pristine back up,\n\n345\n00:20:22.827 --> 00:20:26.673\nof everything that I like the way I like\nit, then I can always roll it back or\n\n346\n00:20:26.673 --> 00:20:29.612\nrestore that back up and\nI'm good to go for the next job.\n\n347\n00:20:29.612 --> 00:20:33.810\n>> Yeah, and absolutely we want\nto make this as easy as possible.\n\n348\n00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:38.640\nAnd I was talking about some of this here.\n\n349\n00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:43.490\nIf we can go take a look at this for\na second,\n\n350\n00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:48.490\nthere's an update button\nI hit on the screen here.\n\n351\n00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:50.300\nLet me show you what I did.\n\n352\n00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.190\nIs you can see right here\nthere's an update button.\n\n353\n00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:57.952\nThis is a great post installation task do,\nyou tap that button and it brings up this\n\n354\n00:20:57.952 --> 00:21:02.316\nterminal window and what you're seeing\nthere, I mean it's not visible.\n\n355\n00:21:02.316 --> 00:21:04.720\nI'll just tell you, it's not really\nvisible on there, readable on there.\n\n356\n00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:09.350\nBut what it's telling you is like well,\ndo you want me to do a Pwn Pad update and\n\n357\n00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:12.090\nit just says one for yes and two for no.\n\n358\n00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:17.000\nYou just go ahead and say do the update,\nand it's gonna go out there and it's gonna\n\n359\n00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.150\ncheck for things to see if it's completely\nup to date and all that good stuff.\n\n360\n00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:27.300\nSo hopefully you're doing\nthat regularly too.\n\n361\n00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:32.160\nMetasploit has its own in here,\nsome of the other tools do have their own\n\n362\n00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.620\nstuff but typically,\nyou don't have to run those.\n\n363\n00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.251\nTypically, if you run\nthe one in Metasploit, yeah,\n\n364\n00:21:38.251 --> 00:21:39.771\nit'll try to do an update, but\n\n365\n00:21:39.771 --> 00:21:43.450\nthis one will actually should catch\nthat one plus other stuff too.\n\n366\n00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:46.130\nAnd they're pretty good\nabout updating their stuff.\n\n367\n00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:52.028\nAt one point I checked like every week or\ntwo, and\n\n368\n00:21:52.028 --> 00:21:57.662\nthere was something coming down, they call\nthem recipes and stuff in some cases.\n\n369\n00:21:57.662 --> 00:21:58.640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I saw these new recipes\n\n370\n00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.774\nwere getting downloaded.\n\n371\n00:21:59.774 --> 00:22:03.626\nAnd then maybe just be something minor, a\nnew script or something that someone wrote\n\n372\n00:22:03.626 --> 00:22:06.518\nor they wrote and developed and\nit got pushed out to the device.\n\n373\n00:22:06.518 --> 00:22:11.164\nBut it was something that they're really\ngood about, I mean, that's the thing\n\n374\n00:22:11.164 --> 00:22:15.330\nyou look at this Community Edition\nof the Pwn Pad you'd think that, oh,\n\n375\n00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:19.350\nwell it's lacking something\nover the professional edition.\n\n376\n00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:21.440\nIt's actually pretty equivalent.\n\n377\n00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:26.105\nNow, if you want to have their training\nand their support and all that then yeah,\n\n378\n00:22:26.105 --> 00:22:28.715\nyou're not gonna get it\nwith the Community Edition.\n\n379\n00:22:28.715 --> 00:22:32.515\nCommunity Edition does have forums and\nstuff like that to help you with this\n\n380\n00:22:32.515 --> 00:22:35.560\npost installation stuff, and\nthe usage stuff if you want.\n\n381\n00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.770\nAnd there is a guide that Pwnie Express\ncomes out, they're very good\n\n382\n00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:44.890\nabout providing information,\nwherever they can on it.\n\n383\n00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:48.470\nSo don't think you're lacking\nsomething by doing this.\n\n384\n00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:53.510\nYou still have a very powerful device\nthat's equivalent to what they have.\n\n385\n00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:57.210\nJust minus the support and\nthe training in there.\n\n386\n00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:00.660\nBut heck,\nif you're someone that's ambitious and\n\n387\n00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.440\nis willing to put in the effort,\nyou should be good with that anyway.\n\n388\n00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.713\n>> Absolutely, if you've gone through\nthe trouble of getting the hardware,\n\n389\n00:23:07.713 --> 00:23:12.454\ndownloading the Community Edition, and\ngetting all this done, hopefully you're\n\n390\n00:23:12.454 --> 00:23:16.277\nalso willing to dive in and\nlearn how to support it yourself as well.\n\n391\n00:23:16.277 --> 00:23:17.165\n>> Yeah-\n>> Like you said,\n\n392\n00:23:17.165 --> 00:23:21.085\nthey've got great documentation on their\nwebsite, so the resources are there.\n\n393\n00:23:21.085 --> 00:23:22.930\n>> Yeah, they really do.\n\n394\n00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:26.447\nThey really support you on this stuff,\n\n395\n00:23:26.447 --> 00:23:31.029\nso I think that's great,\ncuz when I got my Pwn Pad,\n\n396\n00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:37.400\nI got it second hand from somebody\nthat didn't need it anymore.\n\n397\n00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.040\nSo I got that one.\n\n398\n00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.848\nBut I also was looking at these ones too\nand I built my own so I could customize it\n\n399\n00:23:42.848 --> 00:23:46.500\nand do a bunch of stuff to it and\nleave my other one alone, and experiment.\n\n400\n00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.107\nPlenty of support for\nthe Community Edition.\n\n401\n00:23:52.107 --> 00:23:55.752\nI can't actually say if there\nis a single difference between\n\n402\n00:23:55.752 --> 00:23:58.479\nthe Community Edition and\nthe full edition.\n\n403\n00:23:58.479 --> 00:24:01.531\nTo me it looks indistinguishable.\n\n404\n00:24:01.531 --> 00:24:03.823\nIt's just that other stuff that they,\n\n405\n00:24:03.823 --> 00:24:08.850\nthe add-on services that they provide with\nit, so if you need that, that's there.\n\n406\n00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:13.660\nBut if you don't need that, you could\nbuild a whole Pwn Pad like we have here,\n\n407\n00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:20.075\nfor probably, I've specced it\nout over the last few months.\n\n408\n00:24:20.075 --> 00:24:20.790\nAnd all of,\n\n409\n00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:23.890\nthat you could build a Pwn Pad from\nscratch with the adapters and everything.\n\n410\n00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:27.020\nYou could probably do it for\nprobably about 300 bucks.\n\n411\n00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.810\n>> Mm.\n>> You know, which isn't bad.\n\n412\n00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.810\nThat's not including an Ubertooth,\n\n413\n00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:33.610\nif you want that's gonna be\nanother hundred on top of that.\n\n414\n00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.561\nBut you could build the device\nas we have it here,\n\n415\n00:24:36.561 --> 00:24:41.840\nyou know, buy the tablet and\nbuy the adapters.\n\n416\n00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.590\nI'd say between 200 to 300.\n\n417\n00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:48.420\nDepending on how new of a device you\nget and the capabilities of the tablet,\n\n418\n00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.530\nthat's gonna dictate a lot.\n\n419\n00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:52.740\nJust a couple other things here.\n\n420\n00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:59.050\nIf you do decide you want to create\na Pwn Phone, the process is the same.\n\n421\n00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.800\nIt's exactly the same.\n\n422\n00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:08.360\nWe did this here because all things\nconsidered it's still more easily readable\n\n423\n00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:14.190\nfrom the blimp than the phone is.\n\n424\n00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:18.060\nThe process is identical.\n\n425\n00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:22.950\nAll the stuff I just did here,\nyou're gonna do it the exact same way on\n\n426\n00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:28.600\na Nexus 5 so, if you were looking\ntowards going that, same thing.\n\n427\n00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.550\nIf you want to have both,\nthen go ahead and do the same process.\n\n428\n00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:35.660\nSame adapters work on both.\n\n429\n00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:41.450\nSo you really don't lose anything here\nby doing it here or the other way.\n\n430\n00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:42.880\nIt's really, really cool.\n\n431\n00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.330\nDo pay attention by the way\nwith the Pwn Pad at least,\n\n432\n00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:49.910\nthere's two as we mentioned\nwhen we did our installation.\n\n433\n00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:54.400\nIf you have problems post installation,\npay attention to the fact that there is\n\n434\n00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.120\ntwo distro's up there for\nthe Pwn Pad, okay?\n\n435\n00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:02.640\nIf you choose the wrong one it may\nnot work cuz there were some minor\n\n436\n00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:07.670\ndifferences in the Nexus 7 between before\na certain date and after a certain date.\n\n437\n00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:11.050\nAnd and those differences were enough\nthat they had to make two distro's.\n\n438\n00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.980\nSo, if you get the newer distro and you\ntry to put it on the older one, there's\n\n439\n00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:19.360\na chance that you may have some hiccups\nthere, or your model may not be supported\n\n440\n00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.550\nfully and it could cause you get all\nsort of boot loops and stuff like that.\n\n441\n00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:26.250\nSo if you got that,\nthat's one of your primary\n\n442\n00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.800\npost installation tasks that\nyou want to take a look at.\n\n443\n00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.440\nIt's like, why is it not doing that?\n\n444\n00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:35.430\nWell, if you have a Nexus 7 device,\nyou know, Nexus 5 is a Nexus 5.\n\n445\n00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:38.380\nIf you have one of those, fine.\n\n446\n00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:42.600\nBut a Nexus 7, the first four models,\nand they do change before and\n\n447\n00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.260\nafter a certain date.\n\n448\n00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:49.660\nMake sure that you have the correct one,\notherwise you may very well be\n\n449\n00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:54.240\ngoing down a lot of rabbit holes and\ncrying a lot before you figure out,\n\n450\n00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.100\nall I had to do was just\ndownload their image and\n\n451\n00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.730\njust redo the process with the right one,\nand it would've worked.\n\n452\n00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:02.810\nMaybe it's a little time consuming but\nit would've been a lot easier and\n\n453\n00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:04.561\nbeen a like, why is this, oh man.\n\n454\n00:27:04.561 --> 00:27:05.770\n>> [LAUGHS]\n>> So,\n\n455\n00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:07.586\njust trying to save you some time there.\n\n456\n00:27:07.586 --> 00:27:08.210\n>> Very good.\n\n457\n00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.360\nAll right well Sean, great episode there.\n\n458\n00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:15.720\nGot to see the end result of getting that\nCommunity Edition from Pwnie Express and\n\n459\n00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.200\nbuilding our own Pwn Pads.\n\n460\n00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.640\nSo hope everybody out there enjoyed it,\nthat's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n461\n00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.960\nSigning off for ITProTV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n462\n00:27:22.960 -->

00:00:15.080\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.750\nWith me today is Mr.\nSean Oriyano, and in this episode Sean,\n\n5\n00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.252\nwe're gonna take a look at our\nPwn Pad that we built previously.\n\n6\n00:00:22.252 --> 00:00:26.210\nWe're gonna explore some of the Wi-Fi\noptions that we have with that.\n\n7\n00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.430\nAnd the Bluetooth options, and\n\n8\n00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.450\nsome of the adapters that we can get to\nextend our range and our functionalities.\n\n9\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.760\nSo Sean, what do you got for us?\n\n10\n00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.330\n>> Well we've got a couple things here.\n\n11\n00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.763\nAnd now what I'm gonna,\nwhat I'm showing here,\n\n12\n00:00:40.763 --> 00:00:45.261\nI mean if you've watched\nthe Kali NetHunter shows you've kind of\n\n13\n00:00:45.261 --> 00:00:49.410\nalready familiar with this stuff,\nbut just hold on here.\n\n14\n00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.030\nWe're going to new territory with it, is\nthat we know about the Bluetooth adapters\n\n15\n00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.195\nthat we've seen time and time again.\n\n16\n00:00:57.195 --> 00:00:59.525\nThis is an industrial Bluetooth adapter.\n\n17\n00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:04.115\nAnd that's not me just saying oh,\nit's an industrial strength one,\n\n18\n00:01:04.115 --> 00:01:05.107\nit's actually true.\n\n19\n00:01:05.107 --> 00:01:08.155\nThey do literally do call it\nan industrial Bluetooth adapter.\n\n20\n00:01:08.155 --> 00:01:11.765\nSo it's designed for\nspecialized applications.\n\n21\n00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:16.935\nIt has more power and capability\nthan a standard Bluetooth adapter.\n\n22\n00:01:16.935 --> 00:01:20.700\nThis just happens to be a Wi-Fi\n\n23\n00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.210\nadapter that supports packet injection and\na few other things.\n\n24\n00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.253\nNow, the thing is between what\nwe use these two just to review,\n\n25\n00:01:30.253 --> 00:01:33.548\nwe do these instead of using\nthe ones in the tablet.\n\n26\n00:01:33.548 --> 00:01:36.786\nThe one in the tablet will not use or\n\n27\n00:01:36.786 --> 00:01:41.706\nwill not work to the same\nlevel that these ones will.\n\n28\n00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:44.874\nThe ones, the Bluetooth adapter and\nthe tablet will not do packet injection,\n\n29\n00:01:44.874 --> 00:01:47.230\nit will not do monitoring,\nsniffing, any of that stuff.\n\n30\n00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.841\nSo that will be completely off the table\nfor you if you don't have that.\n\n31\n00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:53.560\nYou don't need it unless you're\ngonna do Bluetooth hacking.\n\n32\n00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.765\nBut I'm presuming if you have the\ncapability and you see the tools on there,\n\n33\n00:01:56.765 --> 00:01:57.978\nyou're gonna want to do it.\n\n34\n00:01:57.978 --> 00:02:01.940\nSo just save yourself some time and get\nit, because you're gonna want it later.\n\n35\n00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.276\nThis one is pretty much,\nthis first of all,\n\n36\n00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:10.150\nthis is pretty much the only one type of\nBluetooth adapter like this you can get,\n\n37\n00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.210\nso you're pretty much limited to this.\n\n38\n00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.250\nThere are other Wi-Fi adapters\nthat do different types of,\n\n39\n00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.910\nwell do the same thing this one\nwill from different vendors.\n\n40\n00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.610\nDifferent types of shapes and\nsizes and all of that but\n\n41\n00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.930\nthey will do pretty much the same thing.\n\n42\n00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.290\nI would go with these ones it's not\nme making a product recommendation or\n\n43\n00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.170\nanything as far as endorsing them.\n\n44\n00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.880\nIt's me saying that you\nshould get these two for\n\n45\n00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.998\nthe simple reason that these two\nare specifically designed to, or\n\n46\n00:02:37.998 --> 00:02:42.770\nthe Pwn Pad is specifically designed and\noptimized to work with these.\n\n47\n00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.250\nAnd you can also use it with NetHunter.\n\n48\n00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.690\nSo, if you wanna go back and forth,\neasiest way is just to get these ones\n\n49\n00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.230\nbecause that'll make that whole\nprocess that much easier.\n\n50\n00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.950\nIf you get special adapters for,\nor different adapters for,\n\n51\n00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.450\nthen this and you use them with Kali,\nKali will recognize them.\n\n52\n00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.150\nThis one won't, but\n\n53\n00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.040\nthe Pwn Pad does have more power\nin this area right out of the box.\n\n54\n00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.400\nSo it will look for these things even.\n\n55\n00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.190\nSo that what we're doing now\nis we're going to talk about\n\n56\n00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.900\nwork using these things\nwith the Pwn Pad and\n\n57\n00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.940\nkind of give you a look at the tools for\nit, such as they are.\n\n58\n00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.530\nSo, that's the first couple things.\n\n59\n00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.564\nAgain, you're gonna need one of these.\n\n60\n00:03:24.564 --> 00:03:28.460\nYou're gonna need the same USB,\non the go, OTG for\n\n61\n00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.260\nshort, cable, that we had and\nsaw for Kali NetHunter.\n\n62\n00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.760\nNo special stuff or anything there.\n\n63\n00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.980\nSo you're just going to grab\nyourself one of these and\n\n64\n00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.740\nup to you if you want to grab one or\ntwo of them.\n\n65\n00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.450\nI actually have four of these at home\njust because they're cheap enough to do.\n\n66\n00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.672\nAnd the reason why I have that many,\nI have a couple spares,\n\n67\n00:03:47.672 --> 00:03:49.232\nwhich is always a good idea.\n\n68\n00:03:49.232 --> 00:03:54.207\nBut I also just usually have one plugged\ninto each one of these adapters I can just\n\n69\n00:03:54.207 --> 00:03:57.634\nswap them back and\nforth real quick, just doing that.\n\n70\n00:03:57.634 --> 00:04:00.310\nIt's the little things in life.\n\n71\n00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.350\nSo, let me just show you something here.\n\n72\n00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.550\nFirst of all, I'll get my adapter ready,\nnothing, no funny business or\n\n73\n00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.055\nanything going on there.\n\n74\n00:04:10.055 --> 00:04:11.745\nSo, I got that ready.\n\n75\n00:04:11.745 --> 00:04:13.965\nBut let's take a look at the Pwn Pad.\n\n76\n00:04:13.965 --> 00:04:18.632\nJust before we start doing anything with\nthe wireless specifically let's talk about\n\n77\n00:04:18.632 --> 00:04:20.983\nwhere the Pwn Pad's gonna come in, okay?\n\n78\n00:04:20.983 --> 00:04:24.685\nWhat we have is we have the network tools,\nthe attack tools,\n\n79\n00:04:24.685 --> 00:04:26.975\nthe wireless tools and Bluetooth.\n\n80\n00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:31.280\nIf I go to the wireless ones, let me\njust kind of point something out here.\n\n81\n00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.260\nIf one of the, one of the really cool\ntools I like on here is one called Wifite.\n\n82\n00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.590\nAnd this may not be entirely\nvisible to you, don't sweat it.\n\n83\n00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.389\nI'm not worried necessarily about\nthe details of everything right now.\n\n84\n00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.250\nBut what we see here is\nwhen I bring this up.\n\n85\n00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.948\nWhat you're seeing right here if you\ncan read it, if not no big deal.\n\n86\n00:04:53.948 --> 00:04:58.551\nWhat you're seeing is, it has,\nit's listing out the two adapters, okay.\n\n87\n00:04:58.551 --> 00:05:02.464\nThat's a problem in there\nbecause those two adapters,\n\n88\n00:05:02.464 --> 00:05:06.210\none of them is not usable,\nit's a virtual deal.\n\n89\n00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.500\nThe other one is WLAN0.\n\n90\n00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.840\nWLAN 0 is the one that's built into this.\n\n91\n00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.630\nSo if I was to say okay,\nuse two with that and\n\n92\n00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.120\nhit two, and enter,\nit's going to try to go ahead and use it.\n\n93\n00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.120\nAnd what its do,\nit came back and says, oh, hey,\n\n94\n00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.090\nlook at the menu just repeated on that.\n\n95\n00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.700\nIt says, well,\n\n96\n00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.600\nI can't, I couldn't do anything with\nit is basically what it's saying.\n\n97\n00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.930\nIt doesn't give an error message, it just\ncomes back and says okay can't do it.\n\n98\n00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.950\nThis is what's available,\nwhat do you wanna use?\n\n99\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.210\nWhat you have to have available is you\nhave to take your little adapter here and\n\n100\n00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.260\nyou have to just go ahead and\nplug this thing in, okay.\n\n101\n00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:54.810\nNow you usually do not have to exit out\nof the system to get it to change this.\n\n102\n00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:01.037\nBut I'm just gonna go ahead,\njust quickly and I am going to close that.\n\n103\n00:06:01.037 --> 00:06:04.230\nI'll close that,\nthat's my update box that I ran.\n\n104\n00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:09.070\nJust close a couple things here, and\nI'll just go back into it, open it up.\n\n105\n00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.490\nAnd if you look at it now,\n\n106\n00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.570\nyou can see that the list is\nactually a little bit longer, okay?\n\n107\n00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.633\nThere's one more that one on\nthe bottom and there's actually WLAN1.\n\n108\n00:06:19.633 --> 00:06:23.130\nI'll just go ahead and\nread that for you, it's WLAN1.\n\n109\n00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.640\nIf I choose that one now, and hit enter,\n\n110\n00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.460\nit's going to do its thing and\nit's gonna start up the scanning process.\n\n111\n00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:40.200\nAnd this is something that you\ngotta be a little aware of this,\n\n112\n00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.820\nis I don't know if this will\nactually show up on screen.\n\n113\n00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.801\nMaybe we can switch to the wide shot,\nor the bigger shot out here.\n\n114\n00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:51.813\nIs if you see my adapter,\nmaybe you can see a little,\n\n115\n00:06:51.813 --> 00:06:54.359\nthere's a little green dot flashing here.\n\n116\n00:06:54.359 --> 00:06:58.128\nIt doesn't show up too well on camera so\ntrust me about it, but trust me with that.\n\n117\n00:06:58.128 --> 00:07:02.996\nBut that's something, when you plug\nit in initially, don't be surprised\n\n118\n00:07:02.996 --> 00:07:07.190\nif you don't see any lights or\nanything showing up on this thing.\n\n119\n00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.450\nMaybe it's going to show up a bit\nbetter there, just really faintly.\n\n120\n00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.475\nJust visualize a green\ndot right about there.\n\n121\n00:07:12.475 --> 00:07:17.704\n[LAUGH] You can vaguely see it but don't\nworry, it's not like it's a deal breaker.\n\n122\n00:07:17.704 --> 00:07:21.394\nBut that's the adapter actually working\njust like you'd see a flashing light on\n\n123\n00:07:21.394 --> 00:07:23.120\nyour Ethernet port.\n\n124\n00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.200\nIt's one of the things that can\nconfuse people in here is that it\n\n125\n00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.600\nwon't necessarily when you plug\nthat in it won't always come on.\n\n126\n00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.180\nIt'll look like the adapter's just dead.\n\n127\n00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.620\nIt's not dead,\n\n128\n00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.210\nit just doesn't send anything to it\nunless you actually have activated it.\n\n129\n00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:41.847\nIn this case, once it's gone and activated\nit, It will start that light flashing.\n\n130\n00:07:41.847 --> 00:07:45.458\nWhereas the Bluetooth\nadapter if you plug it in,\n\n131\n00:07:45.458 --> 00:07:50.660\nthe blue light on it is gonna become\nvisible whether you use it or not.\n\n132\n00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.598\nSo that sometimes can throw people so\ndon't be surprised.\n\n133\n00:07:54.598 --> 00:07:58.810\nWhat this tool's doing now is\nit's actually, just to show, and\n\n134\n00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:03.404\nthis is also kinda shows you how easy it\nis to To do stuff with the Pwn Pad is\n\n135\n00:08:03.404 --> 00:08:07.464\nthat I've plugged it in,\nit's actively doing scanning, and\n\n136\n00:08:07.464 --> 00:08:11.400\nyou can see that the screen is\nblinking there periodically.\n\n137\n00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.820\nThat's it refreshing.\n\n138\n00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:13.770\nWhat you're seeing is,\n\n139\n00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.600\nis it's actually actively scanning\nwireless networks in this area.\n\n140\n00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.560\nIt's not cracking anything, but\nit is doing surveillance on this area,\n\n141\n00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.240\nseeing what's available.\n\n142\n00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.608\nSo, what you have is,\nyou have a list of wireless networks.\n\n143\n00:08:27.608 --> 00:08:31.434\nWhat you have is, you have,\nwhat type of security setting it's using.\n\n144\n00:08:31.434 --> 00:08:36.254\nWPA, WPA2 or the ever popular WAP.\n\n145\n00:08:36.254 --> 00:08:38.300\nSo, which you guys should use more of,\n\n146\n00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.590\nbecause I don't need to be working\nthis hard to get your stuff.\n\n147\n00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.734\nSo, but it's got this.\n\n148\n00:08:44.734 --> 00:08:47.610\nAnd then, it's got how much\npower the thing's putting out.\n\n149\n00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.541\nAnd then, this is a interesting\none over here, this is WPS.\n\n150\n00:08:50.541 --> 00:08:53.470\nIf it's red, WPS is not supported.\n\n151\n00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.070\nIf it's green, WPS is supported.\n\n152\n00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.210\nAnd then, over here,\n\n153\n00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.877\nit will actually tell you if there's\nclients currently attached to it.\n\n154\n00:09:00.877 --> 00:09:07.643\nSo, in one shot,\nwe've already gone pretty far with this.\n\n155\n00:09:07.643 --> 00:09:12.094\nBut you can do other stuff with this too,\nand\n\n156\n00:09:12.094 --> 00:09:17.025\nthis is what I really like\nabout the Pwn Pad here,\n\n157\n00:09:17.025 --> 00:09:23.157\nis if you do a, whoops,\nhitting the buttons on live TV here,\n\n158\n00:09:23.157 --> 00:09:27.728\nyou just do a control C,\nit actually captures\n\n159\n00:09:27.728 --> 00:09:32.100\nthe list of networks\nat that point in time.\n\n160\n00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.700\nSo, right now, that's no longer updating.\n\n161\n00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.650\nIt's just saying, okay, you scanned for\nawhile, you picked up some\n\n162\n00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:43.170\nwireless networks, and of the ones on\nhere, which ones would you want to target?\n\n163\n00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.430\nNow I could really cause\nsome mischief at this point.\n\n164\n00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:48.550\nI'm not going to.\n\n165\n00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.204\nI don't know.\n\n166\n00:09:49.204 --> 00:09:50.467\nWhat network is Tim on?\n\n167\n00:09:50.467 --> 00:09:54.345\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] What you could do at this\n\n168\n00:09:54.345 --> 00:09:57.498\npoint, I'll stop it right here,\n\n169\n00:09:57.498 --> 00:10:03.149\ncuz what I can do at this next\npoint here is, I could actually,\n\n170\n00:10:03.149 --> 00:10:07.730\ncuz this green column here\nis actually numbered.\n\n171\n00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:13.110\nAll I have to do is type in the number or\nnumbers of those networks I wanna attack,\n\n172\n00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.592\nand it'll start doing an attack.\n\n173\n00:10:18.592 --> 00:10:19.873\nLet's see, actually,\n\n174\n00:10:19.873 --> 00:10:23.050\nis there one here that no one's\nusing that I can get away with?\n\n175\n00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:24.211\nYou can take a quick look at it.\n\n176\n00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:27.442\n[LAUGH]\n>> Probably not.\n\n177\n00:10:27.442 --> 00:10:28.446\n>> Pick a number, if you think.\n\n178\n00:10:28.446 --> 00:10:31.130\n>> Let's not do the sheriff's,\nlet's not do ITProTV.\n\n179\n00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:32.650\n>> There's a sheriff in there?\n\n180\n00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.277\n>> We don't wanna do any of that.\n\n181\n00:10:34.277 --> 00:10:38.703\nSo [CROSSTALK]\n>> A few of them look like they're\n\n182\n00:10:38.703 --> 00:10:42.997\nduplicated in there, but, yeah,\nno I would suggest we don't.\n\n183\n00:10:42.997 --> 00:10:43.988\nWhat type of attack is it gonna,\n\n184\n00:10:43.988 --> 00:10:46.065\nlet's say you did type in one of\nthe numbers, what's it gonna do?\n\n185\n00:10:46.065 --> 00:10:50.117\nGive you a choice of attacks, is there\na particular attack that's gonna by\n\n186\n00:10:50.117 --> 00:10:54.140\ndefault or is it,\njust start the process, what's it doing?\n\n187\n00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:58.610\n>> If I was gonna attack\none of these things, and\n\n188\n00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.050\nI checked with Mike here to see if\nanything was owned by us in here,\n\n189\n00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.010\nto see if it was something\nthat was a viable target test,\n\n190\n00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.710\nbut we're not gonna go that far.\n\n191\n00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:17.600\nWhat would happen, if I was to type\nin the number of a network on there,\n\n192\n00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.260\nbecause its captured that list,\nif I type in the number of it,\n\n193\n00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.690\nit will start trying to do stuff\nto get the password off of that.\n\n194\n00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.791\nAnd the way it will do it is,\nit'll either try to do a deauth against\n\n195\n00:11:29.791 --> 00:11:34.124\nit automatically, where it'll try\nto listen to clients attaching.\n\n196\n00:11:34.124 --> 00:11:38.471\nAnd if there's no client's attaching,\nit will fire out a deauth, and\n\n197\n00:11:38.471 --> 00:11:42.819\nit'll target an existing client on there,\nif there's one there, and\n\n198\n00:11:42.819 --> 00:11:46.670\ntry to force it off the network,\nthe deauth will do that.\n\n199\n00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:49.700\nSo I would pick one that\npresumably has clients next to it.\n\n200\n00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.860\nIt would fire a deauth out,\nkick that client off, and\n\n201\n00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.550\nwhen the client tries to reattach,\nit would capture the handshake.\n\n202\n00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.570\nAnd then, it would actually\nstart saving that information.\n\n203\n00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:04.300\nAnd once it got to a point where it's\ndone that enough, I can tell it to just\n\n204\n00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.870\ncancel that part of the process,\nand it would save that to a file,\n\n205\n00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:11.850\nthen start trying to break it, and see if\nit could retrieve the code off of that.\n\n206\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.440\nAnd that's how easy it is.\n\n207\n00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.980\n>> Yeah, Shawn.\nLook for one, I think everyone set up,\n\n208\n00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:21.670\nDDWRT, just a little TP link access\npoint should show up in there.\n\n209\n00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.360\n>> Okay.\n\n210\n00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:28.370\nSo what we'll do is we will take\na look at our list in here,\n\n211\n00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.080\nto see if we find one called DDWRT, and\n\n212\n00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.380\nit looks like number ten on\nour list corresponds to that.\n\n213\n00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:40.160\nSo, what we would do, and\nthis is all our access point here, so\n\n214\n00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.880\nremember we do have permission to do it.\n\n215\n00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.600\n>> Sean, I give you permission,\nand I don't think you can do it.\n\n216\n00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.561\n>> All right, you guys saw it.\n\n217\n00:12:46.561 --> 00:12:47.180\nIt's documented.\n\n218\n00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, anyway,\n\n219\n00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:54.390\nwhat we'll do is the way Wifite works is,\n\n220\n00:12:54.390 --> 00:13:00.640\nwe will just type in the number,\nrather, of our access point.\n\n221\n00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:03.730\nAnd remember, what you do is,\nyou turn this on, you scan for\n\n222\n00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:09.920\nyour wireless networks, and\nthen you will actually do a control C.\n\n223\n00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.144\nIt captures the state at that point in\ntime, which is what we have on screen.\n\n224\n00:13:15.144 --> 00:13:18.868\nAnd when you just go through and\nyou look at the actual numbers,\n\n225\n00:13:18.868 --> 00:13:23.576\nthe index number of the access points,\ndon't just assume that when you saw it,\n\n226\n00:13:23.576 --> 00:13:27.790\noh that's the number it's gonna be,\nbecause until you hit control C,\n\n227\n00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.185\nthat number is actually gonna\nchange based on strength.\n\n228\n00:13:31.185 --> 00:13:34.825\n>> [CROSSTALK] Those things bounce around\nin that list, so you gotta freeze it for\n\n229\n00:13:34.825 --> 00:13:37.686\na moment, so it knows which\nnetwork you're talking about.\n\n230\n00:13:37.686 --> 00:13:42.090\nBy the time you type in number ten,\nthat might have changed.\n\n231\n00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:44.833\n>> Until you do control C, it won't give\nyou the chance to type in the number.\n\n232\n00:13:44.833 --> 00:13:47.864\nBut don't go through and say oh,\nwell it's numbered over here, and\n\n233\n00:13:47.864 --> 00:13:51.014\nI saw it, it's number whatever,\ncontrol C, and type that number in.\n\n234\n00:13:51.014 --> 00:13:54.328\nDouble check before you do it,\nbecause that number may have changed,\n\n235\n00:13:54.328 --> 00:13:57.696\nwhen you hit control C it may have,\ncuz the single strike, like I said,\n\n236\n00:13:57.696 --> 00:13:59.462\nmay have gone through and done that.\n\n237\n00:13:59.462 --> 00:14:02.930\nSo it is number ten on this list,\nso it's got that.\n\n238\n00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:07.330\nSo what we'll do is we will hit enter,\nand it's gonna say,\n\n239\n00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:11.020\nit's says,\nit's gonna be tough to read on there.\n\n240\n00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:16.930\nIt says it's starting the actual process,\nright now it's listening for a handshake.\n\n241\n00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:23.800\nAnd if we have someone attach to that\nnetwork, which it looks like it's got you,\n\n242\n00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.810\nit's saying it does have someone\nlisted on there, which is Mike.\n\n243\n00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.720\nSo, right now,\nyou saw another line pop up.\n\n244\n00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.390\nIt didn't,\nsince it didn't get a handshake,\n\n245\n00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.810\nyou saw it change really quickly there.\n\n246\n00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:39.320\nIt sent a Deauth out to Mike's system,\nto kill your action.\n\n247\n00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.387\n>> And I can tell you on my computer,\nI'm watching my Wifi connection here,\n\n248\n00:14:42.387 --> 00:14:44.430\nit says, looking for Wifi networks.\n\n249\n00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.700\nWiFi on, so right now it did boot me off.\n\n250\n00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.780\n>> And so, it's actively doing that.\n\n251\n00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.960\nAnd so, it's sending another one out here.\n\n252\n00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:58.660\nAnd so, it just sent another one out to\nsee if it could cause another handshake.\n\n253\n00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.300\nAnd what it's gonna do is,\nit's just gonna do this for\n\n254\n00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:06.790\nas long as you just let it do whatever,\nor let it do its process here.\n\n255\n00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.740\nIf I was to go over to my notebook here,\nand\n\n256\n00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:13.050\ntry to attach to that network,\nit's gonna go through, and do it.\n\n257\n00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.860\nSo it just sent another\ndeauth request out, and\n\n258\n00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:22.360\nit knows Mike's MAC address,\nit picked that up off of traffic.\n\n259\n00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:28.680\nSo, it fired another one out, and you\ncan probably see that it did that again.\n\n260\n00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:34.650\nWhile that's running,\nif I was to go over to my system here,\n\n261\n00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:39.650\nand find that DDWRT network, and\n\n262\n00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:44.180\nI was to type in that password\n\n263\n00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:50.820\nfor it, you can see that it said,\nhey, something's happening.\n\n264\n00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.680\nIt said another line popped\nup in there really quickly.\n\n265\n00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.064\nIt said, new client found.\n\n266\n00:15:56.064 --> 00:16:01.341\nAnd so, it read the actual Mac address,\nand so, okay, it's picked that up.\n\n267\n00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:05.880\nA new client came in and\nthe handshake process happened.\n\n268\n00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.448\nAnd so, if you leave this running and\nit collects enough of those things.\n\n269\n00:16:10.448 --> 00:16:15.794\nAt one point when you decide you've\ncollected enough, you can just go through\n\n270\n00:16:15.794 --> 00:16:21.335\nand do a Ctrl-C on that and it will now\nstart the process of actually saving that.\n\n271\n00:16:21.335 --> 00:16:24.430\nThat's disabling it and\nit will start going ahead and\n\n272\n00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:28.570\ncapture that file and then decide if it's\ngoing to go ahead and try to crack it.\n\n273\n00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:29.180\n>> Nice.\n\n274\n00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.970\n>> So once it gets enough it will do that.\n\n275\n00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:33.240\nSo it's pretty neat.\n\n276\n00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.498\nNow the cracking process\nhere will take a while.\n\n277\n00:16:36.498 --> 00:16:39.928\nSo it's not something that we're\njust gonna sit here and be like,\n\n278\n00:16:39.928 --> 00:16:41.040\nhey how's it going?\n\n279\n00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:46.270\nSo, but it can take a while.\n\n280\n00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:50.260\nEspecially in this situation because\nwe really didn't wait that long.\n\n281\n00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:55.820\nWe had Mike's system, my system, and it\nwas just sending de-auth requests to him.\n\n282\n00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.940\nIt captured my handshake OA coming in.\n\n283\n00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:03.830\nIt doesn't have a lot of traffic to go on,\nso with the little bit of traffic\n\n284\n00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.010\nit's gonna take longer to break\nit with something like WPA.\n\n285\n00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:07.820\nWhat we're looking for\n\n286\n00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.000\nis a lot more traffic to be\nable to do the analysis on it.\n\n287\n00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.220\nSo we want to leave this running\na lot longer in practice.\n\n288\n00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.800\nBut once it has that.\n\n289\n00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.070\nIt will switch over and\nstart trying to analyze that file and\n\n290\n00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:21.500\nretrieve that password.\n\n291\n00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.350\nAnd in fact, I stopped it prematurely.\n\n292\n00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:28.980\nYou can just leave it ad when it gets\nenough it will automatically do that.\n\n293\n00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:33.881\nAnd that's what's really\nneat about this Pwn Pad\n\n294\n00:17:33.881 --> 00:17:38.665\nis the fact that with\na little device like this and\n\n295\n00:17:38.665 --> 00:17:44.979\nyour wi-fi adaptor that they've\noptimized us to work with it.\n\n296\n00:17:44.979 --> 00:17:49.964\nI have enough here just like I said, just\nto put this on a little case underneath\n\n297\n00:17:49.964 --> 00:17:53.214\nit and walk around with the thing and\njust act like,\n\n298\n00:17:53.214 --> 00:17:56.980\nI'm reading my whatever on it and\nno one's the wiser.\n\n299\n00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:01.230\nThat's what's really, really,\nI find just such a nice thing about this.\n\n300\n00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.000\nIt's a nice thing to have in your toolkit.\n\n301\n00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.840\nIn fact,\nI keep this in my toolkit already,\n\n302\n00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.980\njust because it's such\na handy thing to have.\n\n303\n00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.870\nAnd just to, I'll close WiFi,\n\n304\n00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:19.570\nsomething that I just wanna also point\nout when you're doing this is sometimes,\n\n305\n00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:26.590\nif you're not a Linux person remember\nthis is ultimately a Linux-based system.\n\n306\n00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:27.930\nIf you're not a Linux person,\n\n307\n00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:33.280\ndo be aware of making sure that you're\nexiting applications correctly and\n\n308\n00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.010\nnot just, shut them down and then doing\nthe swipes like you would on Android.\n\n309\n00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:41.090\nMake sure you close\nthe applications properly on here.\n\n310\n00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:44.930\nWith what I just did it's possible that\nyou could run the application and then try\n\n311\n00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:49.340\nto do one of those little closes where\nyou swipe, just like in regular Android.\n\n312\n00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.500\nAnd what will happen is when you do that,\n\n313\n00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:57.040\nit could actually cause a situation\nwhere the adapter stays in monitor mode.\n\n314\n00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.870\nAnd if you try to use another\nwireless cracking tool,\n\n315\n00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.430\nit's gonna say I can't get a hold of that\nadapter cuz it's still in launcher mode.\n\n316\n00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:03.470\nIn which case,\nyou're gonna have to reboot the system,\n\n317\n00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:08.460\nwhich doesn't take that long, but\nit's still kind of a little annoying,\n\n318\n00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:13.320\nbut you'll learn how to\nnot do that really quick.\n\n319\n00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.682\nIt's got plenty of other tools on here.\n\n320\n00:19:15.682 --> 00:19:22.550\nHere's the ever popular Kismet\nthat's got running on here.\n\n321\n00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:27.600\nAnd be aware too,\nsome of these tools don't necessarily\n\n322\n00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.330\nalways format the exact same\nway they do on the desktop.\n\n323\n00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:37.663\nSo, sometimes you'll get some kind of\njust funky kind of things on there.\n\n324\n00:19:37.663 --> 00:19:39.573\nBut, this is Kismet.\n\n325\n00:19:39.573 --> 00:19:41.863\nIt looks pretty much familiar and\n\n326\n00:19:41.863 --> 00:19:47.735\nrecognizable to anybody that's seen on\na desktop system, just gonna go through.\n\n327\n00:19:47.735 --> 00:19:51.260\nI got my adapter plugged in,\nand it's blinking away.\n\n328\n00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.260\nAgain, doing it still, and\n\n329\n00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.620\nyou can see it just picking\nstuff up there and targeting it.\n\n330\n00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:00.220\nJust to make sure you're clear on it,\n\n331\n00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:04.880\nyou have WiFi in the previous\ntool I was showing.\n\n332\n00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.090\nWe got Kismet here.\n\n333\n00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:08.220\nThey look very close, very, very close.\n\n334\n00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.770\nThey don't do the same thing.\n\n335\n00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:13.900\nThis, what you're seeing right here for\nKismet,\n\n336\n00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:18.115\nthis is a WiFi surveillance tool or\nsite survey tool.\n\n337\n00:20:18.115 --> 00:20:23.395\nYou could actually, and\nthe Pwn Pad does support this, if you want\n\n338\n00:20:23.395 --> 00:20:29.115\nto use the internal Bluetooth adapter, you\ncan connect to an external Bluetooth GPS.\n\n339\n00:20:29.115 --> 00:20:34.950\nAnd you can connect the GPS to Kismet and\n\n340\n00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.510\nactually map out where the access\npoints are so you could do a really,\n\n341\n00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:41.000\nreally kind of thorough\nsite survey with this.\n\n342\n00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.530\nThis isn't doing it right now but\nyou could do that but\n\n343\n00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:45.870\nthat's all it will do is tell you hey,\n\n344\n00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.550\nthese are the wireless networks we have,\nthese are the power levels and\n\n345\n00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:51.770\nall that which is what stuff you're\nseeing at the bottom, all that here.\n\n346\n00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.930\nBut other then that,\nit's not going to help you break anything.\n\n347\n00:20:55.930 --> 00:21:01.660\nWiFi is designed to specifically to not\nonly do this, find the wireless networks,\n\n348\n00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:04.980\nbut also to help you go\nthe next step of breaking them.\n\n349\n00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.454\nSo that's what we're seeing here.\n\n350\n00:21:08.454 --> 00:21:09.830\nWe're seeing a little\nsurveillance going on here, and\n\n351\n00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:12.600\nyou can see what we have as\nthe list of networks up top.\n\n352\n00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.590\nWhat you're seeing down here,\nthis is something that you don't\n\n353\n00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:20.520\nnecessarily see on the Kismet that's\non Linux normally, is you're seeing\n\n354\n00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.590\na lot of Mac addresses down here,\na much longer list of them down here.\n\n355\n00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:26.850\nAnd giving you more information\nabout these clients.\n\n356\n00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:30.720\nI'm seeing stuff like Dell systems down\nthere and some other systems in there.\n\n357\n00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.790\nAnd then you're seeing information\non power levels and all that, too.\n\n358\n00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.880\nAnd it's just going to keep going and\ngoing and\n\n359\n00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.500\ngoing as long as I want to let it do this.\n\n360\n00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.050\n>> So now what if we want to switch\ngears and start doing Bluetooth,\n\n361\n00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:45.180\nwe just swap the antennas out and\ngo there?\n\n362\n00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:50.030\n>> That's actually all it is is that you\nshould, if you want to cancel out of it,\n\n363\n00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:53.960\nyou should just go close the application.\n\n364\n00:21:53.960 --> 00:22:00.440\nIf you want to do Bluetooth, all you have\nto do is just unplug your adapter here.\n\n365\n00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.230\nAnd you're gonna take\nyour Bluetooth adapter.\n\n366\n00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.558\nAnd I'll put that over there so\nyou guys don't think I'm doing anything.\n\n367\n00:22:05.558 --> 00:22:08.030\nSo I got my Bluetooth adapter.\n\n368\n00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:11.510\nI will just go ahead and\nplug the thing in.\n\n369\n00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.070\nYou can see that it's all glowing.\n\n370\n00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:17.570\nIt's my flux capacitor\nis working right now.\n\n371\n00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:23.340\nSo I got that thing plugged in\nto show us Bluetooth tools.\n\n372\n00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:28.750\nI'll just do the Bluetooth scan\nto keep it nice and simple.\n\n373\n00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.720\nOne of our default things in here.\n\n374\n00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:37.610\nSo it is doing a Bluetooth scan so after\na bit we may have to let it sit there for\n\n375\n00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:39.590\na little bit, but after sitting there for\n\n376\n00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:41.740\na little bit you'll see that,\noh, it's picking up devices.\n\n377\n00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:42.910\nThere we go.\n\n378\n00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:48.230\nWhat you're seeing on screen is you're\nseeing that it's actually extracting data.\n\n379\n00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:51.200\nThis Bluetooth scan's actually\nextracting data from Bluetooth\n\n380\n00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.470\nenabled devices that are in\nthis area it's picking up.\n\n381\n00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:57.120\nSo it's doing this sweep and\nit's finding that.\n\n382\n00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:01.132\nThe information that you're seeing here\ntells you stuff about power levels,\n\n383\n00:23:01.132 --> 00:23:05.218\nservices that are available on that\ndevice, the nature of that actual device.\n\n384\n00:23:05.218 --> 00:23:09.600\nIt's telling you all that right\nthere as much as it can get.\n\n385\n00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:14.190\nAnd Bluetooth devices, the Bluetooth stack\nactually will tell you all this stuff.\n\n386\n00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.390\nIt will tell you what services it's\nexposing, tell you all those things.\n\n387\n00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:22.333\nSo this right here is actually just\ntaking advantage of that and saying,\n\n388\n00:23:22.333 --> 00:23:26.724\nyeah these are the things I found,\nand what do you want to do now?\n\n389\n00:23:26.724 --> 00:23:29.927\nNow, that's one of\nthe bigger things we have,\n\n390\n00:23:29.927 --> 00:23:34.740\nthat's one of the things that\nhelps us locate Bluetooth devices.\n\n391\n00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.724\nIf you wanna do more there's\nactually the Ubertooth device,\n\n392\n00:23:38.724 --> 00:23:42.180\nwhich Ubertooth would be a subject for\nanother time.\n\n393\n00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:46.310\nUbertooth would start that device\non there, plug that one in, and\n\n394\n00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.169\nthat one can do the scanning.\n\n395\n00:23:48.169 --> 00:23:51.483\nBut you also have the ability to plug some\nother tools in there that can allow you to\n\n396\n00:23:51.483 --> 00:23:54.871\ndo some kind of really neat experimental\nstuff if you really want to get into that.\n\n397\n00:23:54.871 --> 00:23:57.182\nBut with this by itself, you can actually,\n\n398\n00:23:57.182 --> 00:24:01.304\nthere are scripts in here That will allow\nyou to do things like bluesnarfing and\n\n399\n00:24:01.304 --> 00:24:04.750\nall that where you are extracting\nstuff from Bluetooth devices.\n\n400\n00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:08.130\nBut this is one where you\nhave to have something\n\n401\n00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:10.020\nlike this to do the really advanced stuff.\n\n402\n00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.620\nYou have to have this or the Ubertooth\nbecause they're the really two big ones\n\n403\n00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.920\nthat will allow you to do the monitoring,\nthe packet injection and stuff like that.\n\n404\n00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.130\n>> Yeah, so give you those advance\ncapabilities as well as extend your range.\n\n405\n00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:24.070\nI think we saw that one goes out to\nabout 1,000 feet or something like that,\n\n406\n00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.310\nwhich is obviously more\nthan my Nexus 7 would do.\n\n407\n00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:31.312\n>> Yeah, way, way more than your\naverage Bluetooth device is gonna go.\n\n408\n00:24:31.312 --> 00:24:38.030\nIn fact, this antenna in here,\nyou can actually unscrew that and put in\n\n409\n00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:42.915\na better quality antenna which the company\nthat makes this actually has available.\n\n410\n00:24:42.915 --> 00:24:49.135\nI can extend them out to you\nabout 4,500 feet, so you're\n\n411\n00:24:49.135 --> 00:24:55.145\ntalking a substantial increase in range to\nbe able to hit stuff from that distance.\n\n412\n00:24:55.145 --> 00:24:59.105\nNot only does it increase the distance,\nlike I said, it's got those other things,\n\n413\n00:24:59.105 --> 00:25:00.295\nlike the packet injection,\n\n414\n00:25:00.295 --> 00:25:04.930\nstuff like that built in as part\nof it's core functionality.\n\n415\n00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.390\nI like the fact that this package,\n\n416\n00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:10.640\nit kind of looks like something that\nshould be injecting stuff right now.\n\n417\n00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.200\nBut that's the two adapters, just to\nkind of make sure you're clear on it.\n\n418\n00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.730\nThese are the two adapters that\nyou that you really need or\n\n419\n00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:19.460\nhave to have if you're\ngonna use the Pwn Pad.\n\n420\n00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:23.090\nIf you get any other Bluetooth adapter,\nany other network adapter,\n\n421\n00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:28.420\nthe chances are you might get lucky\nwith using another wireless adapter\n\n422\n00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.350\nthat's not the TP link one.\n\n423\n00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:34.368\n>> But the Bluetooth adapter,\nit's not gonna like it.\n\n424\n00:25:34.368 --> 00:25:39.070\nThey're actually pre-configured\nto look for these devices and\n\n425\n00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.550\nmake sure their there.\n\n426\n00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:45.350\nIf you turn one of those utilities on and\nthese devices aren't present, that utility\n\n427\n00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:50.930\nwill just will either not run, or it will\nthrow fits when you try to do something.\n\n428\n00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:54.782\nSo, pretty much with the Pwn Pad,\nyou have to have these.\n\n429\n00:25:54.782 --> 00:25:59.425\n>> Kali NetHunter,\nyou can use a different WiFi adapter,\n\n430\n00:25:59.425 --> 00:26:03.245\nBluetooth, again because of the\ncapabilities, it's this or the Ubertooth.\n\n431\n00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:06.800\n>> Sean, tell you what,\nthat was a good episode there.\n\n432\n00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.970\nWe got to see the Pwn Pad in action,\nand use it with those adapters.\n\n433\n00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:14.440\nWe got to see that wireless adapter hooked\nup, saw it take advantage of that and\n\n434\n00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:19.580\nthen the tools built into that Pwn Pad,\nas well that Sena, if I remember right?\n\n435\n00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:20.260\n>> Yes.\n\n436\n00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:24.230\n>> The Sena Bluetooth adapter started\npicking up devices all over the building,\n\n437\n00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:26.290\nso very good stuff.\n\n438\n00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:29.920\nAny parting thoughts for\nus on our Bluetooth and WiFi?\n\n439\n00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.625\n>> Not really, other than saying these\nadapters, I guess I should add if,\n\n440\n00:26:34.625 --> 00:26:38.955\nfor these adapters, easiest way to make\nsure you're getting the right ones is just\n\n441\n00:26:38.955 --> 00:26:40.745\nto go up to Pony Express' site.\n\n442\n00:26:42.175 --> 00:26:47.815\nThey have the adapters, it's their stuff\nand they know what they need for Pwn Pad,\n\n443\n00:26:47.815 --> 00:26:51.868\nthey actually do because they know people\nare building a community edition, and\n\n444\n00:26:51.868 --> 00:26:53.790\nthey fully embrace people doing that.\n\n445\n00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:57.810\nThey have the adapters available for\npurchase on their own.\n\n446\n00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:01.920\nIf you don't want to fish around and\nhave to do all that, you can get them and\n\n447\n00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.950\nI found the prices on their site for\nthese things are actually pretty good.\n\n448\n00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:09.130\nMaybe you get that some\nplace a little cheaper but\n\n449\n00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:11.340\nyou probably have to\ndo a lot of searching.\n\n450\n00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.930\nI would say just go there.\n\n451\n00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:16.640\nKeep it nice and simple and\nthen you got some nice adapters to use\n\n452\n00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.930\nwith your NetHunter device too,\nand even your PC, if you want.\n\n453\n00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.420\n>> Very good.\n\n454\n00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.340\nLadies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n455\n00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.830\nWe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n456\n00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:27.240\nSigning off for ITProTV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n457\n00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.140\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n458\n00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.077\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n459\n00:27:29.077 -->

00:00:14.810\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.350\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.264\nAnd in this episode we're going to\ntake a look at using Kali NetHunter,\n\n6\n00:00:21.264 --> 00:00:24.787\nwhich we actually saw how we could\nset that put on our own device,\n\n7\n00:00:24.787 --> 00:00:27.220\nour own Nexus 7, and some other episodes.\n\n8\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.980\nSo, make sure you go back and\ncheck those out if you didn't see them.\n\n9\n00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.270\nWe're gonna take a look at some\nof the tools we've got on there.\n\n10\n00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.370\nIn particular, some USB based attacks\nthat we can do with Kali NetHunter.\n\n11\n00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.794\nSo Sean, what do you got lined up for\nus here?\n\n12\n00:00:40.794 --> 00:00:45.370\n>> We've got a couple interesting ones\ngoing on here with Kali NetHunter.\n\n13\n00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.518\nWhat we have is we're gonna be\ntaking a look at attacks called,\n\n14\n00:00:49.518 --> 00:00:52.963\nfirst of all,\nfirst one's called a bad USB attack,\n\n15\n00:00:52.963 --> 00:00:56.513\nthe other one is gonna be\nwhat they call an HID attack.\n\n16\n00:00:56.513 --> 00:01:00.660\nThey're actually ones that we've discussed\nbefore, we've actually seen before.\n\n17\n00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.581\nThey're just, we can do these and\n\n18\n00:01:03.581 --> 00:01:08.554\nset these whole things up with\nthe Kali NetHunter device.\n\n19\n00:01:08.554 --> 00:01:13.690\nIt's something actually,\nKali is getting to be known for,\n\n20\n00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.110\nso I want to thank one of\nthe powers that it actually has.\n\n21\n00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.571\nSo what we want to do is see\nwhat these two attacks are and\n\n22\n00:01:20.571 --> 00:01:22.540\nwhat they would allow us to do.\n\n23\n00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.550\nOne of them, the bad USB attack,\nis gonna allow us to set the device\n\n24\n00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.020\nup in such a way that we could\nactually route traffic from our RPC\n\n25\n00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.940\nthrough whatever PC we attach it to\nthrough, the Kali NetHunter device.\n\n26\n00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:39.940\nAnd once you've done that,\n\n27\n00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.359\nnow you've got the stage set to\ndo a man in the middle attack.\n\n28\n00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.560\nSo that would be one attack we can do.\n\n29\n00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.200\nThe other attack we can do,\nthe HID attack is doing\n\n30\n00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.615\nthe same thing the USB rubber ducky does,\nwhich is when you plug it in,\n\n31\n00:01:56.615 --> 00:02:02.355\nit actually can have it run a script,\nand it can start\n\n32\n00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:08.255\nrunning commands on a system rather\nthan the system blocking it.\n\n33\n00:02:08.255 --> 00:02:12.475\nThe big benefit of that of course,\nis if you have a stock flash drive and\n\n34\n00:02:12.475 --> 00:02:13.985\ntry to plug it into a system,\n\n35\n00:02:13.985 --> 00:02:17.980\nwhat happens if they have a policy\nsomething blocking USB devices.\n\n36\n00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.050\nWell, what happens is when you plug it in,\nit blocks it, it doesn't work.\n\n37\n00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.350\nThat's what it's supposed to do.\n\n38\n00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.470\nHowever, if we use an HID attack,\n\n39\n00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.300\nwhat happens is is that we plug it in,\nit appears as a keyboard.\n\n40\n00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.440\nIt tells the system it's a keyboard, and\n\n41\n00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.680\nnow it's injecting scripts\ninto the actual system.\n\n42\n00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.550\nSo we're gonna see how these\nattack are actually set up,\n\n43\n00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.230\nthey're pretty cool,\nwhen we take a look at it.\n\n44\n00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.260\nSo what we have is,\n\n45\n00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.580\nI'm gonna go over to my NetHunter\ndevice here, on my NetHunter device.\n\n46\n00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.410\nAnd let me kinda square that up for you.\n\n47\n00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:01.490\nOn my Nethunter device, to access these\nyou have to go to a part of the interface.\n\n48\n00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.310\nYou'll see it right in,\nthis one right here called NetHunter Home.\n\n49\n00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.290\nSo we're gonna activate that,\nand that brings up this deal.\n\n50\n00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.630\nAnd it gives you some information about\nthe system and all that, which is fine,\n\n51\n00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.800\nbut let's take a look at the menu.\n\n52\n00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.120\nThis menu here has a list of\nattacks that it can actually do,\n\n53\n00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.640\nand we'll take a look at some\nof those some other time.\n\n54\n00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.440\nBut it's got the ability\nto do various things.\n\n55\n00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.460\nBut there's our HID keyboard attack,\nthere's our Ducky Script attack,\n\n56\n00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.630\nthere's our bad USB attack.\n\n57\n00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.290\nSo, it's got some really\nkinda neat stuff in there.\n\n58\n00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.310\nAnd this isn't counting other\nthings that we have down here\n\n59\n00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.780\nthat can really mess with you.\n\n60\n00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.800\nIt even has the ability to have\nthis thing act as an access point.\n\n61\n00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.185\nSo, if you really want to start\nredirecting stuff, and who doesn't?\n\n62\n00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:50.400\n>> [LAUGH] Who doesn't?\n\n63\n00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.330\n>> So, if we take a look at this, and\n\n64\n00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.150\nyou probably recognize some of\nthe things that are going on here.\n\n65\n00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.630\nIf we look at the, for example,\nthe HID Keyboard attack.\n\n66\n00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.880\nWe have, when we look at what's\ncoming up on screen here, and\n\n67\n00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.630\nI'll just kind of read this off to you so\nyou can see what's going on,\n\n68\n00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.080\nit's gotta have the IP\naddress of the system.\n\n69\n00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.630\nAnd it says right next to it on here,\nit says lhost.\n\n70\n00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.490\nSo if you remember,\nif you kind of think back a bit,\n\n71\n00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.000\nyou probably remember the keyword\nlhost if you watched Metasploit,\n\n72\n00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.140\nbecause lhost was something\nthat was used there a lot.\n\n73\n00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.290\nSo it's local host.\n\n74\n00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.520\nThat's the IP address that you're\ngoing to configure all the local host.\n\n75\n00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.000\nThe port that it's going to\nbe listening on for the S.\n\n76\n00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.080\nThen if you look down at the next line,\nit's got Windows meturpeter reverse HTTPS.\n\n77\n00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.264\nSo it's gonna, what's happening here\nis that this is gonna allow you to give\n\n78\n00:04:48.264 --> 00:04:53.146\nyou the ability to open up a reverse\nshell via AHTPS into this IP address.\n\n79\n00:04:53.146 --> 00:04:53.883\n>> Wow.\n\n80\n00:04:53.883 --> 00:04:57.810\n>> So you can go ahead and\nyou can set this up.\n\n81\n00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.710\nOnce you've configured\nit the way you want, and\n\n82\n00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.200\nI'll leave those settings the way they are\nfor right now cuz they're perfectly fine.\n\n83\n00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.770\nIf you didn't want this IP address,\nyou want it to match more,\n\n84\n00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.620\nyou want it to match the networking\nscheme of the network you're attacking,\n\n85\n00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.830\nyou would put that in there.\n\n86\n00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.140\nIf that port isn't gonna work,\nput a different port in there.\n\n87\n00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.580\nAnd then when you're done,\njust go ahead and hit update.\n\n88\n00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.960\nAnd you see it gives me a little grey\nbubble up top and all that stuff, and\n\n89\n00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.710\ntells me that it's actually changed it.\n\n90\n00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:32.510\nSome other neat things is, with this\nexploit, if you scroll over in here,\n\n91\n00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.420\nor swipe over rather,\nyou'll see that it has the Windows CMD.\n\n92\n00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.180\nThis is just a sample script\nthat they put in there.\n\n93\n00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.300\nBut you could put really any script\nin there that you want that's a valid\n\n94\n00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.590\nWindows command.\n\n95\n00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.440\nSo, you can see it's got,\nin here it's got IPConfig, and\n\n96\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.850\nthen it's just printing something or\ndoing some stuff on the actual screen, and\n\n97\n00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.460\nit sends some messages out.\n\n98\n00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.320\nIt just is a sample, but\nyou can change that to anything you want.\n\n99\n00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.390\nOnce you've changed it again,\nyou hit Update.\n\n100\n00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.318\nOkay, so you're at a point now where\nyou've got Got the system up and\n\n101\n00:06:04.318 --> 00:06:08.412\nconfigured the way you need it to, or\npresumably the way you need it to.\n\n102\n00:06:08.412 --> 00:06:11.373\nYou've got a payload that you\ncan shoot at a system, and\n\n103\n00:06:11.373 --> 00:06:14.913\nthen you've got a script you're\ngonna run on that system as well.\n\n104\n00:06:14.913 --> 00:06:20.177\nOkay now to keep it interesting and\nall, let's unplug this from my box.\n\n105\n00:06:20.177 --> 00:06:21.671\n>> Wait, don't be plugging it into my box.\n\n106\n00:06:21.671 --> 00:06:24.375\n[LAUGH]\n>> Just to give\n\n107\n00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:27.545\nyou a peek at some other\nthings that are possible here.\n\n108\n00:06:29.082 --> 00:06:32.212\nIf you have,\nyou've got UAC bypass off that.\n\n109\n00:06:32.212 --> 00:06:35.864\nThe unlucky victim has a system\nthat's got UAC on it, and\n\n110\n00:06:35.864 --> 00:06:38.600\nyou wanna make sure\nthat you get past that,\n\n111\n00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.956\nit has the ability to bypass\nthe UAC Windows 7 and 8 built right in.\n\n112\n00:06:42.956 --> 00:06:44.290\nSo if you hit that, and\n\n113\n00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.050\nI've got it configured with\nthe Windows 8 UAC behavior.\n\n114\n00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.460\nIf I go ahead and\nI leave it that way Windows 8's a target.\n\n115\n00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.480\nIt shouldn't trigger the UAC if\nthere's a command in here that should\n\n116\n00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.270\nnormally trigger it.\n\n117\n00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.040\nIt shouldn't trigger the UAC.\n\n118\n00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.750\n>> So much for that keeping me safe.\n\n119\n00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.059\n>> Well yeah, come on.\n\n120\n00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:06.930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Come on Microsoft told you it's\n\n121\n00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:07.507\ninvulnerable.\n\n122\n00:07:07.507 --> 00:07:09.080\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n123\n00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.280\nSo what we wanna see here\nalso is this guy right here.\n\n124\n00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.930\nSo we've run UAC bypass.\n\n125\n00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.060\nIf you're ready to rock and roll and\n\n126\n00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.400\nrun the thing,\nyou got the execute attack deal here.\n\n127\n00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.230\nAnd it will go ahead and\nstart running the actual attacks.\n\n128\n00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.659\nSo if I had left this plugged\ninto my system, which I didn't.\n\n129\n00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:30.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Plug right there, I'm not stupid.\n\n130\n00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:37.520\nSo it would be shooting this\nscript at the actual system now.\n\n131\n00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:43.490\nAnd at that point you, and all you have\nto do is go to that IP address and\n\n132\n00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.060\ntype in the, go to the IP address and,\n\n133\n00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.020\nwith your, at the command prompt or\nwhatever, and you could actually open up,\n\n134\n00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.690\nor through your browser open up,\nsomething on that system.\n\n135\n00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:59.150\nJust like we did when we went metasplit,\nwe opened up interpreter, same deal here.\n\n136\n00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.060\n>> Wow.\n>> Yeah, so it's pretty neat.\n\n137\n00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.370\nThey got that built in right there.\n\n138\n00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.890\nThat's about as easy as you can make it.\n\n139\n00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.210\n>> I was gonna say,\nnot very difficult either, really.\n\n140\n00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.660\n>> Yeah, not at all, not the least bit.\n\n141\n00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.520\nWe got pretty far without\nhaving to do a lot.\n\n142\n00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.689\nNow of course, that's not all,\nas the saying goes.\n\n143\n00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:22.690\nWe also have to talk about,\nthese guys, these HID ducky scripts.\n\n144\n00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:28.520\nA ducky script, just in case you're one of\nthose people that has a USB rubber ducky.\n\n145\n00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.110\nThat little flash drive\nthat Hack Five makes,\n\n146\n00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:35.830\nif you've got one of those,\nyou can take the scripts off of that, and\n\n147\n00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.260\nmove them over to this device and\npaste them in.\n\n148\n00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.730\nBecause it does use it's\nown scripting language.\n\n149\n00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:44.190\nThe scripting language has maybe\nlike eight to ten commands.\n\n150\n00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.230\nYou can drop them in there\nonce you drop them in there\n\n151\n00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:51.470\nall you have to do is just hit the convert\nbutton, and it will go ahead and let you\n\n152\n00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:56.450\nthat lets you use that actual script\nright in there which is pretty neat.\n\n153\n00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:58.420\nAnd I can let you take a look\nat what it looks like.\n\n154\n00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.060\nYou want a preview, I'd already gone\nthrough and done something here.\n\n155\n00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:05.155\nIt shows you what it looks like compiled\ninto actual stuff, we'll put it that way.\n\n156\n00:09:05.155 --> 00:09:08.230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you've got all that.\n\n157\n00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.210\nAnd once again once you're\nready to run that script,\n\n158\n00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.430\nyou've got the whole, they should\nmake that button red right there,\n\n159\n00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.700\nlike a bright red cuz it\nwould feel more dramatic.\n\n160\n00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.420\n>> Absolutely.\n\n161\n00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.070\nSo once you go through you\njust hit execute attack and\n\n162\n00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:24.320\nit's gonna go through and say, if you miss\nup here there's a little gray bubble that\n\n163\n00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.780\nappears right here on\nthe top center of the screen.\n\n164\n00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:32.030\nAnd if you can't read it I'll go ahead and\ndo it again\n\n165\n00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.180\nit's telling you the attack has started\n>> Nice.\n\n166\n00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.770\n>> So it goes up there and\n\n167\n00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:41.540\nit's firing that thing off at\nthe system that it's attached to.\n\n168\n00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:47.730\nSo if you had a micro USB cable plugged\ninto the system, it's actually gonna start\n\n169\n00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:52.290\nfiring that off at the system, and running\nit which is a really really neat thing.\n\n170\n00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:58.940\nSo if we go through and do that, one more\ndeal to talk about in this episode is\n\n171\n00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:04.150\nbad USB attack, this is the one where\nit gets really down to business.\n\n172\n00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:10.200\nWhat this bad USB attack is,\nit doesn't have much to it.\n\n173\n00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:15.160\nYou just go through and\nwhen you're ready to go hit Start.\n\n174\n00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.330\nBut the way this one works is that,\n\n175\n00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:22.250\nyou can use your micro USB cable\nto plug this into a system.\n\n176\n00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:30.780\nOr you can go ahead and take the good\nold networking connector deal and\n\n177\n00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:36.770\nplug this into your USB OTG, and\nplug your network cable into this,\n\n178\n00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:40.000\nand it will go ahead and\nroute traffic through this interface.\n\n179\n00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.280\nAnd the advantage there of course,\nnow I'm taking your network traffic and\n\n180\n00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.130\nsending it through this system and\nI can do what I want with it.\n\n181\n00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.840\nI can sniff it, I can alter it,\nI can redirect it.\n\n182\n00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.440\nThat's what you have going\non right now with it.\n\n183\n00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.110\nIt's actually very, very simple to\ndo when you get down to business.\n\n184\n00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:04.120\nAnd that's the scary thing about this,\nis the fact that you've got something\n\n185\n00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:10.880\nthat you can acquire the hardware for, and\nbuild it for almost no cost whatsoever.\n\n186\n00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.820\nYou can get a few items.\n\n187\n00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.400\nThis whole deal right here,\nthis is like what?\n\n188\n00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:19.150\nThese things are like $30 and\nthe digi cable's maybe like eight.\n\n189\n00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.880\nYou get these things and all this stuff\ntogether, you can run some pretty heavy\n\n190\n00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:29.500\nduty attacks for very little money and\ncause some serious harm in the process.\n\n191\n00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.430\n>> Absolutely.\n\n192\n00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:35.600\n>> And this is in essence,\nautomating what Metasploit was doing.\n\n193\n00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.200\nMetasploit was, you had to go through and\ninject stuff on the system.\n\n194\n00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.520\nWell you saw right here with\nall the stuff that I was\n\n195\n00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.140\nconfiguring back in my first one.\n\n196\n00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.800\nMy keyboard attack, you saw that\nthis was an Meterpreter attack.\n\n197\n00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.260\nIf you decide that you want to get\na little ambitious with it and\n\n198\n00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.540\nreally have some fun,\nyou could actually take that line and\n\n199\n00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.010\nchange it if you want, just tap on it and\nchange it to something else.\n\n200\n00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.720\nYou wanna use http, https,\nwhatever, just change it.\n\n201\n00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.745\nAnd it changes the payload for you that\nit's dropping off, so now you can open\n\n202\n00:12:06.745 --> 00:12:12.420\nan unencrypted connection to that system,\nsend commands back and forth.\n\n203\n00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.583\nSo quite easily, and\nthink about the value of that, by the way.\n\n204\n00:12:16.583 --> 00:12:20.332\nYou're opening up an HTTP connection or\nan HTTPS,\n\n205\n00:12:20.332 --> 00:12:25.500\nwe're gonna reverse shell out to you,\nit's gonna talk to you.\n\n206\n00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:31.830\nIf you're running that,\nwhen this guy calls back to your system,\n\n207\n00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:38.710\nit's going to pass because http and\nhttps are open on most firewalls.\n\n208\n00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.700\nSo once that gets past, you're done.\n\n209\n00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.810\nAnd the fact that you can have\nsomething as simple as a tablet,\n\n210\n00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.485\nI mean we've been through\nthis this before.\n\n211\n00:12:46.485 --> 00:12:47.645\nThat's just a tablet.\n\n212\n00:12:47.645 --> 00:12:52.446\nIf you wanna do this, just have,\nI always say the Kindle app, or something.\n\n213\n00:12:52.446 --> 00:12:55.771\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just let the Kindle app run it on this\n\n214\n00:12:55.771 --> 00:12:57.405\nthing and just go from there.\n\n215\n00:12:57.405 --> 00:13:00.070\nKeep that thing running, and\nif someone asks, say what do you got?\n\n216\n00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.540\nOh, just doing some reading on there.\n\n217\n00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.630\nOkay.\nAnd.\n\n218\n00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.482\n>> Right.\nNone the wiser.\n\n219\n00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:06.970\n>> Meanwhile, pop, pop, pop,\ndeploy it, and you're done.\n\n220\n00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.570\nOnce you have this configured,\nyou can save this.\n\n221\n00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.160\nYou can edit anything\nanytime you want on it.\n\n222\n00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.520\nYou can do all sorts of\nediting on this type of stuff.\n\n223\n00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.780\nAnd look, when I hit edit,\n\n224\n00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.080\nit actually gives you additional\ninformation on what's going on.\n\n225\n00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.090\nOnce you've set that up and updated\neverything, it's just a matter of going to\n\n226\n00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:27.770\nthat menu, tap the menu, tap the exploits,\nset it out and walk away.\n\n227\n00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:29.090\nIt doesn't get much easier than that.\n\n228\n00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:31.690\n>> It doesn't get much\neasier than that at all.\n\n229\n00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:32.640\n>> Absolutely.\n\n230\n00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.940\n>> Well the form factor, everything.\n\n231\n00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:38.320\nThis is why I like it when I look at it.\n\n232\n00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.760\nYou've seen my phone before, my Nexus 5.\n\n233\n00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.120\nI can install Kali NetHunter on that, or\n\n234\n00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.050\nI can install stuff that will do\nthis sort of thing on that as well.\n\n235\n00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:51.170\nI mean think about how easy that would be\nto just plug something in like that and\n\n236\n00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:52.270\ndo the exact same thing.\n\n237\n00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:55.300\nPeople are going to believe\nyou're charging your phone.\n\n238\n00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.070\nIt's very very very easy to do.\n\n239\n00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:03.370\nSo it's something that exciting but it's\nalso frightening in a lot of ways too.\n\n240\n00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:04.850\n>> Yeah.\nYou can find a social engineer,\n\n241\n00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:07.560\nmost people would say,\nhey can I charge my phone?\n\n242\n00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.566\nIt's just about dead and\nI left my wall ward at home.\n\n243\n00:14:10.566 --> 00:14:12.640\nDo you mind if I plug\nthis into your computer?\n\n244\n00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.280\nOh sure, no problem, I know how that is,\nI've been there before, and\n\n245\n00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.383\nlittle do they know.\n\n246\n00:14:17.383 --> 00:14:21.090\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah it's quite easy to do that.\n\n247\n00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:22.880\nBy the way,\nif you really kind of wanna get,\n\n248\n00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.170\nbecause Mike brings up a very good point,\nthe social engineering stuff.\n\n249\n00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:31.150\nOne of the ways you could actually thwart\nsomething like this is you can get stuff\n\n250\n00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.630\nlike the h-hack five.\n\n251\n00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:39.670\nSometimes calls it the USB condom, but\nit's called a USB write blocker now.\n\n252\n00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:46.735\nAnd whatever you call it,\nit's a set of three USB devices,\n\n253\n00:14:46.735 --> 00:14:51.845\nor USB plugs that you can slip over\nthe end of one of your connectors,\n\n254\n00:14:51.845 --> 00:14:54.895\nand just put that plug on there and\nthen plug it into your stuff.\n\n255\n00:14:54.895 --> 00:14:58.145\nAnd it actually blocks the stuff\ngoing in one direction.\n\n256\n00:14:58.145 --> 00:15:00.410\nSo it prevents that from happening.\n\n257\n00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.930\nSo if you want to plus something into\nyour system it keeps it from getting off\n\n258\n00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.930\nthis guy onto your system,\njust put one of those things on.\n\n259\n00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:10.890\nYou put a condom on it and\npop it in and that's the end of it.\n\n260\n00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:12.120\n>> Like we did when you're learning and\n\n261\n00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.220\ntesting especially on your own network\n>> Yeah probably not a bad idea.\n\n262\n00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.610\nIf you're testing, I mean testing if\nyou're doing on your own network.\n\n263\n00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:22.600\nThe thing would be when you're doing that,\nit would actually\n\n264\n00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.520\ncause you not to get the results\nthat you want from the main testing.\n\n265\n00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.760\n>> Yeah, that's true.\n\n266\n00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.890\n>> But if I was to go through and\nbring this to you and say hey,\n\n267\n00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:30.820\ntake a look at this.\n\n268\n00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.140\nWho knows, you might want to say.\n\n269\n00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.575\nYeah, I'm gonna stick two\nof these things on there.\n\n270\n00:15:36.575 --> 00:15:38.820\n>> It's Sean Oriyano, there we go.\n\n271\n00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:39.900\n>> Gonna double bag this thing.\n\n272\n00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.530\nNo way that anybody's\ngonna be touching this.\n\n273\n00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:47.180\nSo it's just simple things\nyou do to protect yourself.\n\n274\n00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.640\nBut it's also very simple\nto run that attack.\n\n275\n00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.960\nMost people will not know about\nthose right blocking devices.\n\n276\n00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:57.270\nThey will just oh I wanna plug this in and\nplug the thing in, or\n\n277\n00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:01.400\nI wanna plug it in, like Mike was saying,\ncan I charge something there, yeah sure.\n\n278\n00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.290\nThink about how easy it just would be to\ndo that and that's not even talking about,\n\n279\n00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:08.100\nthe one that always makes me\nthink about stuff like this.\n\n280\n00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:12.040\nAnd it's been talked about for a while,\nthings like those charging stations,\n\n281\n00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:16.600\nand ports on and USB ports on planes and\nstuff like that now.\n\n282\n00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.910\nIt's like, how easy would it be to\nactually to do something on those.\n\n283\n00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.800\nBecause there are so\nmany different places, and\n\n284\n00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.210\nthey don't protect those\nports on a lot of places, and\n\n285\n00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:32.740\nso just kind of opens the mind to\nadditional possibilities here.\n\n286\n00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.440\n>> Absolutely.\n\n287\n00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:38.030\nAll right, well Sean, a lot of good\ninfo there, a couple really cool attacks\n\n288\n00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:42.680\nthat we can do using that\nKali Net Hunter loaded up on our Nexus.\n\n289\n00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.390\nRelatively easy to do as well.\n\n290\n00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.220\nI mean,\nthey've got most of the work done for us.\n\n291\n00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:50.340\nWe're just changing our local port and\nour local IP address, picking our payload,\n\n292\n00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.540\nand bota bing.\n\n293\n00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.650\nWe've got a reverse shell or\nwhatever it is we choose to do.\n\n294\n00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.300\nVery impressive stuff.\n\n295\n00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.920\nAll right, Sean.\nAny parting thoughts for this episode?\n\n296\n00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.270\n>> Yeah.\nI would tell you, try this out.\n\n297\n00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:05.674\nIt's actually a very,\nvery cool thing to do once you see it.\n\n298\n00:17:05.674 --> 00:17:09.249\nI didn't actually go to the extra\nstep of running the attack,\n\n299\n00:17:09.249 --> 00:17:13.115\ncuz we've run Metasploit before,\nso we've been down that road.\n\n300\n00:17:13.115 --> 00:17:16.338\nBut try it out and\nsee just how easy it is.\n\n301\n00:17:16.338 --> 00:17:20.381\nIt's really, really kind of fun to\nsee the power that you have here, and\n\n302\n00:17:20.381 --> 00:17:23.730\nthe scripts that you can\nrun on a remote system.\n\n303\n00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.450\nOr the system that you're plugging into,\nmaybe not your remote but\n\n304\n00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:27.550\nyou're plugging into it.\n\n305\n00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:29.890\nWell it technically counts if\nyou get a long enough cable.\n\n306\n00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:30.788\n>> That's true.\n\n307\n00:17:30.788 --> 00:17:31.670\n[LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n308\n00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:35.770\nit's, just think of what you can do with\na little device like this or a phone.\n\n309\n00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:39.900\nThat's where I make a big deal about,\nthink\n\n310\n00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:44.210\nof the power that you have right there in\nyour hand with using a device like this.\n\n311\n00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.520\nSaying you're going to plug in something\nlike a notebook into someone's system,\n\n312\n00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.690\nand doing like a crossover cable or\nsomething like that, yeah, come on.\n\n313\n00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:56.650\nThat happens all the time, right most\npeople, even most IT people are gonna say,\n\n314\n00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:58.100\nwait a second.\n\n315\n00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.370\nWe don't want strange notebook\ncomputers plugging into our network.\n\n316\n00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:05.605\nBut don't think twice about a phone or\na tablet.\n\n317\n00:18:05.605 --> 00:18:06.508\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah.\n\n318\n00:18:06.508 --> 00:18:11.290\n>> Doesn't draw any attention,\nor really enough attention.\n\n319\n00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:15.040\nAnd some places do block these\ndevices from being plugged in.\n\n320\n00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:19.112\nYou will get that where some places say,\nwell, you can't bring those in, you know?\n\n321\n00:18:19.112 --> 00:18:22.840\nI've had government facilities, stuff\nlike that, say, no, those can't come in.\n\n322\n00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:27.660\nBut the average corporate world that you\nwork in, or probably will be testing in.\n\n323\n00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.280\nYou could probably very easily\nplug these things in, and\n\n324\n00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.190\nno one's gonna question anything.\n\n325\n00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.300\nI mean, heck, you could probably,\nin most places,\n\n326\n00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.950\neven if someone's not sitting at that\ncomputer, you could run the HID attack,\n\n327\n00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.420\npretty easily to drop\nsomething on that system.\n\n328\n00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.860\nAnd, so, if you wanted to do that,\nno one's sitting at the computer,\n\n329\n00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.960\nall you really have to do, take the thing,\nplug it in, take this long cable,\n\n330\n00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.230\nplug it in, just leave it there for\nfive, ten minutes or whatever.\n\n331\n00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.810\nAnd if someone goes hey who\nplugged it in there, oh well.\n\n332\n00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.280\nI notice no one's using that right now and\nI just gotta, like Mike said,\n\n333\n00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:01.230\nI gotta put a charge on it, so I'll unplug\nit in a second cuz I really gotta go.\n\n334\n00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:01.966\nBet you do.\n\n335\n00:19:01.966 --> 00:19:06.030\n[LAUGH] So you just plug the thing in,\nlet it drop off its payload but don't go\n\n336\n00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:10.890\nreally quick and do the secret agent thing\nand like, plug it in and then pull it out.\n\n337\n00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:14.500\nLeave it there for a few minutes so it\ndoesn't cause anything, and then just walk\n\n338\n00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.890\nout like you own the place, and\nthat no one will be anything the wiser.\n\n339\n00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:18.940\n>> Mm.\nScary stuff.\n\n340\n00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.510\nI'll bet you more places start\nlocking their [LAUGH] or\n\n341\n00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:24.490\nstarting looking at those things\na little bit differently.\n\n342\n00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:25.240\n>> They should be.\n\n343\n00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.643\n>> Especially if they\nwatch these episodes.\n\n344\n00:19:26.643 --> 00:19:28.180\nAll right, Sean.\n\n345\n00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.020\nAnother great episode.\n\n346\n00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.060\nEverybody out there,\nI hope you enjoyed watching but for\n\n347\n00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:35.820\nthis one, we are out of time so\nsigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n348\n00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:36.910\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n349\n00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:37.934\n>> And we'll see you next

00:00:15.175\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:18.985\nWith me today is Mr.\nSean Oriyano and in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:22.645\nwe're gonna be looking at something\ncalled evil access point.\n\n6\n00:00:22.645 --> 00:00:26.332\nWe've actually got a couple of\ndevices that we're going to configure.\n\n7\n00:00:26.332 --> 00:00:27.672\nSean is gonna configure for\n\n8\n00:00:27.672 --> 00:00:32.252\nus the Pone Pad that we configured\nhere with our community edition,\n\n9\n00:00:32.252 --> 00:00:36.882\nas well as Kali NetHunter, both of which\nI believe are running on that Nexus 7.\n\n10\n00:00:36.882 --> 00:00:39.420\nSo we're gonna get to see it done twice,\nand\n\n11\n00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.450\nwe get to compare the two\ndifferent versions.\n\n12\n00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.516\nSo take it away Dr. Evil.\n\n13\n00:00:44.516 --> 00:00:49.270\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It was his idea.\n\n14\n00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.220\nWhat we're going to do\nhere is we are going to\n\n15\n00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.460\nlook at doing a side by side\ncomparison of these two devices.\n\n16\n00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.340\nSo I've got on my NetHunter device and\nmy Pwn Pad device here.\n\n17\n00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.560\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're gonna set\nup this piece of software called EvilAP\n\n18\n00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.915\nand so the EvilAP means it's acting as\nan access point and it's evil apparently.\n\n19\n00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:17.990\n[LAUGH]\n>> But how much does it cost?\n\n20\n00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.800\nIs it $1 million?\n\n21\n00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.865\n>> [LAUGH] Sorry, $ 1 billion.\n\n22\n00:01:22.865 --> 00:01:28.760\n[LAUGH] But what it will do for\nus is it does something really cool.\n\n23\n00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.380\nIn fact, if you remember WiFi Pineapple,\nwe talked about that.\n\n24\n00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.360\nIt's very similar to\nwhat those things do but\n\n25\n00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.430\nwe've got a different\nform factor here ya know.\n\n26\n00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.990\nSo we're gonna see what that actually\ntranslates to when we take what we\n\n27\n00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.750\nlearned over there and put it in that and\nput it in this specific foreign factor.\n\n28\n00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.910\nSo when we set up,\n\n29\n00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.865\nwhen we set up an evil access point,\nwe do have some configuration to do.\n\n30\n00:01:52.865 --> 00:01:54.115\nSome things we gotta know.\n\n31\n00:01:54.115 --> 00:01:58.775\nFirst of all, where we get in is that one\nof these is gonna require, or actually,\n\n32\n00:01:58.775 --> 00:02:02.555\nboth of them are gonna require\nhaving two interfaces prepped.\n\n33\n00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:05.810\nPresumably, what you're gonna have,\nis you're gonna take your traditional, or\n\n34\n00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.920\nthe best way to do it, if you can,\nis get traditional USB adapter,\n\n35\n00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.200\nplug this one into your USB OTG,\njust plug the guy in.\n\n36\n00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.340\nBecause what we're gonna do when we plug\nthis thing in I'm not gonna do it here\n\n37\n00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.475\nbecause it's gonna cause a lot\nof people to be upset at me.\n\n38\n00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:25.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you plug this in, your Pwn Pad or\n\n39\n00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.440\nyour NetHunter, this is gonna be plugged\ninto a physical network somewhere, okay,\n\n40\n00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.580\nand this is gonna act as your\ngateway to the Internet.\n\n41\n00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.130\nThen, what's gonna happen,\n\n42\n00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.770\nis your wireless side of things is gonna\nact as the access point to draw things in.\n\n43\n00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.250\nSo that's what's gonna happen, now you\ncould technically use the wireless adapter\n\n44\n00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.100\ninside that you want to\nconnect to the Internet.\n\n45\n00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.090\nAnd then you use your other one have\nanother wireless adapter there if you\n\n46\n00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.630\nwant it, that's entirely possible if\nyou think you wanna get better range or\n\n47\n00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.490\nsomething like that.\n\n48\n00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.860\nBut I'll let you make the judgement\ncall whether or not what's appropriate.\n\n49\n00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.110\nUsually it's better to do\nthe hardwired one for the connection\n\n50\n00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.890\nto the Internet because once you start\ndrawing people in, you are going to start\n\n51\n00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.310\nhaving a lot of bandwidth that you\nhave got to use to make it look real.\n\n52\n00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.170\nIf it starts getting slow, it's going to\npush people off to other Access points.\n\n53\n00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.630\nSo, we want to avoid that by\nhaving the bandwidth available.\n\n54\n00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.070\nII mean come on these people\nneed to be more considerate.\n\n55\n00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.350\nI've got credentials to steal here I\nain't got time to worry about bandwidth.\n\n56\n00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.660\n>> That's right.\n\n57\n00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.030\n>> I can't do traffic shaping on this,\nyou're getting Internet for free.\n\n58\n00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.588\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n59\n00:03:28.588 --> 00:03:31.550\n>> So-\n>> And a whole lot more probably.\n\n60\n00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.810\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n61\n00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.220\nDo you know how long it takes me to\ncreate those viruses I'm installing\n\n62\n00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.795\non your system?\n\n63\n00:03:35.795 --> 00:03:38.450\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> So, anyway.\n\n64\n00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.400\nSo, I've got the two side by side,\nhere, devices.\n\n65\n00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.130\nI have my Kali NetHunter\ndevice over here on one side.\n\n66\n00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.330\nAnd then I have my Pwn Pad over here.\n\n67\n00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.110\nSo what we're going to do first is we're\ngoing to go over to my NetHunter device.\n\n68\n00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.790\nAnd the way we're going to set\nup the evil access point stuff\n\n69\n00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.370\nis we're going to go right here\nagain to the NetHunter home,\n\n70\n00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.140\ndeal, and\nwe are going to once we get in there,\n\n71\n00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.120\nwe are going to NetHunter\nhome it brings up this deal.\n\n72\n00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.190\nSo we've got that.\n\n73\n00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.280\nThat looks great.\n\n74\n00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.250\nWhat we're gonna do is, once we get in\nthere you can see that we have right here\n\n75\n00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.630\nthe evil access point deal.\n\n76\n00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.510\nSo what we'll do is we click on that,\nand this is the simple and\n\n77\n00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.140\neasy to do configuration screen for this.\n\n78\n00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.550\nWhat you do is it tells it, okay,\nwell how do you want this thing to work?\n\n79\n00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.010\nYou're gonna put in what interface you\nwant this thing to broadcast out on.\n\n80\n00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.640\nSo if you have another adapter you wanna\nplug in this would be the time to do it.\n\n81\n00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.010\nIf you're gonna use the one internally,\n\n82\n00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.680\nyou're gonna want to check to\nsee what the numbering is on it.\n\n83\n00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.170\nIs it WLAN0, is it WLAN1, what is it?\n\n84\n00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.930\nThat's what you're gonna drop in there.\n\n85\n00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.040\nThen you're going to put,\nit probably will chance the BSS ID,\n\n86\n00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.030\nthat's what it's going to\nbroadcast as the quote\n\n87\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.880\nunquote MAC address if you\nwant to look at it that way.\n\n88\n00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.850\nThen you have your SSID sitting over here.\n\n89\n00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.360\nYou can put in whatever SSID you want.\n\n90\n00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.685\nI suggest you do not put in Internet.\n\n91\n00:05:12.685 --> 00:05:14.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's probably not gonna\n\n92\n00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.510\nwork as effectively as free Internet,\nor adult Internet.\n\n93\n00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.780\nSomething like that,\nthat one will work trust me.\n\n94\n00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.650\nNow so, you can tell what channel and\nthis one right here,\n\n95\n00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.170\nthis is the really interesting one here.\n\n96\n00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.960\nI'm not going to go as\nfar as to enable this,\n\n97\n00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.120\nbecause I do not want to\ncause any issues here.\n\n98\n00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.743\nWe still have other\npeople in the building.\n\n99\n00:05:37.743 --> 00:05:40.040\n>> What will happen is,\nyou can see right here,\n\n100\n00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.678\nthis is where it gets real interesting,\nis where is says enable karma.\n\n101\n00:05:43.678 --> 00:05:45.830\nKind of an interesting word for it.\n\n102\n00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.360\nWhat will happen is if this is enabled and\nrunning,\n\n103\n00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.880\nit will actually start\ntracking clients into it.\n\n104\n00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.780\n>> Wow.\n\n105\n00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.550\n>> So, you gotta think about that.\n\n106\n00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.740\nDo you wanna actually go out, start\nattracting people into this whole thing,\n\n107\n00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.570\nor do you just wanna wait for\nthem to attach as they see it?\n\n108\n00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.090\nSo, it's a pretty interesting\nthing what karma will do.\n\n109\n00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.250\nYou turn it on, it will help you\nstart reading those probe requests.\n\n110\n00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.970\nAnd helping to draw your victims or\n\n111\n00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.470\nyour guests depending on how\nyou're feeling that day.\n\n112\n00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.120\nAnd so other things you can do is,\nyou can actually change it's teletype and\n\n113\n00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.100\ntell it scripts to run.\n\n114\n00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.320\nIf you want there's a whole bunch of\nconfiguration options if you want to get\n\n115\n00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.700\ninto it.\n\n116\n00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.390\nI usually choose just to\nleave this the way it is.\n\n117\n00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.120\nThis is stuff that when\nthe system runs it will actually\n\n118\n00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.150\nexecute these scripts to\nconfigure the access point.\n\n119\n00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.670\nI usually just leave\nthem the way they are.\n\n120\n00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.920\nI really haven't had a reason\nto change these things.\n\n121\n00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.690\nOnce you've got this set up, lets just\nsay that you've got this all set up.\n\n122\n00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.330\nYou got your addresses and\neverything all punched in that you want.\n\n123\n00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.380\nOnce you're ready to get this thing going,\nall you do is you go over here and\n\n124\n00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.800\njust click Start mana, or Stop mana,\ndepending on where you are.\n\n125\n00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.500\nAnd just wait for\nthe fun and games to happen.\n\n126\n00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.370\nWhat you should be seeing, at that point,\nis if you pick up another wireless-enabled\n\n127\n00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.840\ndevice, so if I was sitting here and\nI picked up my phone.\n\n128\n00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.210\nAnd I'm scanning the area,\nwithin some period of time.\n\n129\n00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.030\nUsually, it's not that long.\n\n130\n00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.450\nI should start seeing the name of\nwhatever access point is popping up.\n\n131\n00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:23.030\nAnd I may even depend on my Karma settings\nand a couple of other things in there.\n\n132\n00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.750\nUsually, the Karma setting's\ngonna be the big impact.\n\n133\n00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.160\nIf that's enabled, when I'm sitting here,\nit's just gonna pull me over,\n\n134\n00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.570\nit will pull me over to that eventually.\n\n135\n00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.930\nSo it will make it look\nlike it's a stronger\n\n136\n00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.760\naccess point than whatever\nI'm listening to.\n\n137\n00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.650\nThe way wireless works is if it finds\nan access point that it's previously\n\n138\n00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.510\nconnected to, or previously\nconnected to or it is connected to,\n\n139\n00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:49.130\nit finds one that's got a stronger signal,\nit's just gonna bump over to that.\n\n140\n00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.294\nThat's the way it usually works.\n\n141\n00:07:51.294 --> 00:07:55.626\nSometimes a device won't do that, but\nmost of the time it will do that.\n\n142\n00:07:55.626 --> 00:07:59.499\nSo if I'm sitting here, Using WiFi and\non my phone just doing stuff and\n\n143\n00:07:59.499 --> 00:08:03.965\nit will eventually pick that up, and\nit may even, if I'm not paying attention,\n\n144\n00:08:03.965 --> 00:08:06.282\nit may just go ahead and\ngo pop right over.\n\n145\n00:08:06.282 --> 00:08:11.990\nYou know just like Mike when we\nwere doing our demo earlier where\n\n146\n00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:17.273\nI de-authed you with the Pwn Pad,\nyou knew I was doing it.\n\n147\n00:08:17.273 --> 00:08:20.696\nAnd in the wild someone seeing that's\ngonna be, oh a bubble popped up and\n\n148\n00:08:20.696 --> 00:08:22.330\nit went away really quick.\n\n149\n00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.370\nOkay I guess I got a hold\nof a bad electron or\n\n150\n00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.610\nsomething like that on the Internet.\n\n151\n00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.100\n>> Happens all the time with wireless.\n\n152\n00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.090\n>> Yeah.\n>> And it's something we've grown\n\n153\n00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:30.210\naccustomed to.\n\n154\n00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:35.280\n>> It's not an unusual event, so that\nwould be something that would cause you\n\n155\n00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:40.098\nto, that's something that\nwould cause you to start\n\n156\n00:08:40.098 --> 00:08:45.280\ndrawing people in and really start\nbeing able to do stuff with them.\n\n157\n00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.670\nI mean once you've got them\nattracted to that access point,\n\n158\n00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.750\nthen it's just a question of\nhaving a sniffer on there.\n\n159\n00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.410\nWe have plenty of sniffers that\nwe can have on this device or\n\n160\n00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.870\nalready have on that device.\n\n161\n00:08:55.870 --> 00:09:01.120\nAnd we just pull people over, so\nthat's just doing an evil access point\n\n162\n00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.115\nattack on the Kali NetHunter device.\n\n163\n00:09:04.115 --> 00:09:10.130\nOn the Pwn Pad device, little different\nto do a side by side comparison in here,\n\n164\n00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.870\nso we've got the Pwn Pad on here.\n\n165\n00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:20.070\nSo we got to do the Pwn Pad, what I had to\ndo this it's actually a little different.\n\n166\n00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:24.240\nWe should be able to access just by\ntapping on our wireless tools right there,\n\n167\n00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.880\nand you see evil access point\nsitting right there for us.\n\n168\n00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.030\nSo what you can do is just tap on that,\nand\n\n169\n00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.030\nit brings up its own\nlittle interface on it.\n\n170\n00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:39.610\nIt's a more text-based interface\nthan what we have sitting over\n\n171\n00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.930\nhere with our NetHunter device,\nbut okay fine, but\n\n172\n00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.400\nit does have the cool green text so\nyou know you're a hacker.\n\n173\n00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.930\n>> Hacker green is always the way to go.\n\n174\n00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:53.870\n[LAUGH]\n>> So it's asking us, it's a little more.\n\n175\n00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:58.690\nI like this one, the way Pwn Pad does it\njust because it's a little more forward\n\n176\n00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:02.090\nwith the way it's handling things.\n\n177\n00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.770\nWhat you're seeing here is select which\ninterface you're going to be using for\n\n178\n00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.870\nInternet, so you're going to tell it,\nyou know, is it connected to the Internet.\n\n179\n00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:14.790\nSo that's the time, if you got this\nplugged in to your hardwired network.\n\n180\n00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.720\nYou're just going to go ahead and\ntell it, hey,\n\n181\n00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.200\nethernet, whatever ETH in this case\nyou know is probably going to be zero.\n\n182\n00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.863\nWe will just say okay, well,\n\n183\n00:10:22.863 --> 00:10:26.780\nit's zero, well it looks like\nit's the second one on the list.\n\n184\n00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.598\nThe cool thing about this is\nif you have a mobile device.\n\n185\n00:10:29.598 --> 00:10:32.920\nIf this Pwn Pad was a mobile one,\n\n186\n00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.920\nit had a sim card in it, you could\nactually use that for Internet too.\n\n187\n00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:37.560\n>> Hm.\n\n188\n00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.520\n>> So that opens up a whole\nnew realm of possibilities.\n\n189\n00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.940\nI mean you turn this into\nan access point which you can do.\n\n190\n00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.830\nYou know now I have something that I can\nshove in my pocket, or whatever, and\n\n191\n00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.000\nbe walking around with it, and\nit's completely inconspicuous.\n\n192\n00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.130\nSo, that opens up a whole new\nrealm of possibilities there.\n\n193\n00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.750\n>> That's pretty nice too,\nthat instead of like with the NetHunter,\n\n194\n00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.623\nit had to kind of know which\ninterface I wanted to use.\n\n195\n00:10:59.623 --> 00:11:02.429\nThis ones showing you all the interfaces\nthat you have available on the device, and\n\n196\n00:11:02.429 --> 00:11:03.805\nyou can just pick it from the list.\n\n197\n00:11:03.805 --> 00:11:07.405\n>> Yeah, absolutely, so\nit does make it a lot simpler, and\n\n198\n00:11:07.405 --> 00:11:10.455\nI like it because it's a little\nmore granular the way it is.\n\n199\n00:11:10.455 --> 00:11:14.170\nThis ones kind of designed just to make it\nas easy as possible to get you in there.\n\n200\n00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:17.680\nThis one is saying, okay,\nwell you better know what you're doing,\n\n201\n00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.790\nbecause we're gonna ask\nyou a few more questions.\n\n202\n00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:23.960\nBut the end result of that is you're\ngonna get to fine tune a bit more and\n\n203\n00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.860\nget the experience that you want.\n\n204\n00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.480\nSo I will say that I will go ahead and\nchoose the interface it's gonna be on.\n\n205\n00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.160\nIt asks you what name you want for\nthe actual internet.\n\n206\n00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:39.710\nSo, I'll just call it,\nlet's say, free internet.\n\n207\n00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.336\nThat always works, right?\n\n208\n00:11:41.336 --> 00:11:42.257\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n209\n00:11:42.257 --> 00:11:47.170\n>> [LAUGH] So you call it that,\nyou hit Enter on it.\n\n210\n00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:51.380\nAnd now it's asking you\nchannel to run it on.\n\n211\n00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.353\nSo, one of the things that you\ncan do is in a congested area or\n\n212\n00:11:55.353 --> 00:12:00.286\nsomething, to help boost your chances\nof getting intercepted by someone\n\n213\n00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:03.247\nis move it off one of\nthose default numbers.\n\n214\n00:12:03.247 --> 00:12:06.690\nThere's usually one, six and\n11 are the ones that people look for.\n\n215\n00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:11.420\nSix is the most common one people go for,\nright smack in the middle,\n\n216\n00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.220\ncause that's the one that they\nget from the manufacturer.\n\n217\n00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.250\nThey don't change it.\n\n218\n00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.745\nSo what I'm gonna do here is I\nprobably would choose one or\n\n219\n00:12:18.745 --> 00:12:21.600\n11 to move it outside of that.\n\n220\n00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.440\nThis is where having Kismet on this\ndevice is actually a god-send.\n\n221\n00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.880\nBecause Kismet, you go and pull out you\nknow, your good old TP link adapter and\n\n222\n00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.330\nplug it in there, and I am going to look\nfor on that TP link, I'm going to look for\n\n223\n00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.180\nthat TP link-up, or sorry I'm going to\nlook for my access points in that area.\n\n224\n00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:42.200\nAnd the access point I'm looking for\nI'm gonna see or\n\n225\n00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.150\nthe access points in the area.\n\n226\n00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.550\nI'm gonna look to see\nwhat channels are using.\n\n227\n00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:49.550\nIf I have a lot of them on six, well then\nI'm just gonna go ahead and choose one or\n\n228\n00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:54.330\n11, because they're\nnon-overlapping channels.\n\n229\n00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.720\nThey do not overlap each other nor\ndo they overlap with six, and\n\n230\n00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.510\nso that makes it that they're gonna\ngive me a good strong signal,\n\n231\n00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:06.660\nthey are free of a lot of congestion,\nand they will start attracting people.\n\n232\n00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.650\n>> So it's most of the algorithms that\nare in our devices that are picking our\n\n233\n00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.770\nwireless or showing us which one\nis the best choice or best signal.\n\n234\n00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.100\nIt's going to look much more attractive,\nbecause there's less congestion,\n\n235\n00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.590\nyou probably have much better signal.\n\n236\n00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.480\n>> Yeah absolutely you're\nboosting your case so\n\n237\n00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.760\nto speak to make it more attractive.\n\n238\n00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.888\nHere it says what channel?\n\n239\n00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:30.503\nI'll just say leave it at one, hit Enter,\n\n240\n00:13:30.503 --> 00:13:37.827\nnext it says force clients to connect\nbased on their probe request.\n\n241\n00:13:37.827 --> 00:13:40.648\nI don't know, I don't know if I\nreally want to do that or not.\n\n242\n00:13:40.648 --> 00:13:41.531\nYeah, of course I do.\n\n243\n00:13:41.531 --> 00:13:42.293\n>> Of course we do.\n\n244\n00:13:42.293 --> 00:13:46.330\n>> Yeah, so it tells you right here.\n\n245\n00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.855\nIt tells you, warning, everything will\nstart connecting if yes is selected.\n\n246\n00:13:50.855 --> 00:13:52.690\n>> [LAUGH] And that's what we want.\n\n247\n00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.800\n>> Well,\ncan't get more clearer than that, can it?\n\n248\n00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.420\nSo it says, yeah, go ahead and\nconnect to it, hit Enter.\n\n249\n00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:04.560\nNext thing, it says, enter the beacon\nrate at which to broadcast probe request.\n\n250\n00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.790\nSo, how often it's gonna send out\nnotifications that it's there.\n\n251\n00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.950\nSo you can choose to\nadjust that either way.\n\n252\n00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.610\nAnd make it, you know, so\nit's gonna happen more often.\n\n253\n00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:18.350\nIt actually allows you\nto do a range in here.\n\n254\n00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.750\n20 beacons to 70 beacons.\n\n255\n00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.567\nOkay?\nSo the more often it does that,\n\n256\n00:14:24.567 --> 00:14:28.660\nthe more refresh is going\nto go out to the devices.\n\n257\n00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.600\nThe more it's going to,\n\n258\n00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.660\nthe more people are going to be able\nto pick it up when it's scanning.\n\n259\n00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.100\nSo if they're sitting\nhere with their device,\n\n260\n00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:39.520\nthe lower the number as this thing's\nscanning if this has a lower number,\n\n261\n00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.400\nit's not gonna pick it up as quickly.\n\n262\n00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.200\nIf it's a quicker one, then it's gonna\npick it up a little more quickly.\n\n263\n00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.660\nSo that helps out.\n\n264\n00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.970\nThere's other quality issues in there too,\nbut we won't worry about those right now.\n\n265\n00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:57.110\nSo it's got the range in there, so\nI'll just leave that to default.\n\n266\n00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.610\nIt says default is 30, so\nI'll leave it at the default.\n\n267\n00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:05.420\nNext thing it does it just starts going\nthrough saying okay, we're ready to go.\n\n268\n00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.010\nNow, I have taken the tip of just take and\nnot plug into the adapter,\n\n269\n00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.750\nso it doesn't cause any mayhem.\n\n270\n00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:15.715\n>> He sees my finger over here\non my disable wireless option.\n\n271\n00:15:15.715 --> 00:15:17.760\n[LAUGH] He's like, is he gonna plug it in?\n\n272\n00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.211\nIs he gonna plug it in?\n\n273\n00:15:19.211 --> 00:15:25.020\n>> [LAUGH] [LAUGH] Yeah, so,\nit's actually started to run,\n\n274\n00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:31.020\nbut it looked for an interface\nto attach to, start listening.\n\n275\n00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.530\nWell, I didn't enable that interface,\nso it can't do that.\n\n276\n00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:36.550\nSo it doesn't cause any mischief.\n\n277\n00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:40.608\nBut, if it had, all I had to do,\nit's properly configured right now.\n\n278\n00:15:40.608 --> 00:15:44.590\nAll I have to do, is just turn\non the wireless in this thing,\n\n279\n00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.832\nplug in this, and just let it go.\n\n280\n00:15:46.832 --> 00:15:49.200\nSo, that's really it.\n\n281\n00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.878\nThings you do wanna think about though\nwhen you're doing this, is that, for\n\n282\n00:15:52.878 --> 00:15:54.820\nexample, the beacons issue.\n\n283\n00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.570\nThe beacons, you can go between 20 and\n70 like we said.\n\n284\n00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.600\nThe higher number of beacons you go,\nthere's another thing that goes with that.\n\n285\n00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.780\nIt sounds like hey, beacon's quicker,\nit has a better chance,\n\n286\n00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:08.000\nit looks stronger, it looks like\nit's gonna get clients quicker.\n\n287\n00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.100\nIt will, but\nit also will drain the battery quicker.\n\n288\n00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.133\nSubstantially.\n\n289\n00:16:12.133 --> 00:16:16.480\nSo, you wanna kinda find, excuse me,\nfind a balance in there, and\n\n290\n00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.540\nsay that okay, which one's a good\nnumber that gives me a balance of both?\n\n291\n00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:26.472\nAnd 30 is the one they default to, because\nit does put out enough probe requests, but\n\n292\n00:16:26.472 --> 00:16:31.110\nnot do it so quickly, those beacons,\nthat it's actually draining that battery.\n\n293\n00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:33.740\nKid you not, that makes a big,\nbig difference.\n\n294\n00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:38.029\nIf you go onto your cell phone, you can go\ninto a cell phone and adjust these things\n\n295\n00:16:38.029 --> 00:16:42.770\nwith certain apps, adjust how quickly\nthis thing looks for wireless networks.\n\n296\n00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.290\nIt will actually start putting\nthe battery life in the toilet.\n\n297\n00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:49.285\nI've seen it where the thing's been fully\ncharged, and you turn the beacon up and\n\n298\n00:16:49.285 --> 00:16:52.230\nsit it there, not doing anything else,\nand you look back later on.\n\n299\n00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.940\nThe battery could be\na quarter of the way gone.\n\n300\n00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.660\n>> Yeah,\nI think most of us probably seen that.\n\n301\n00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:00.670\nIf you've ever leave your Wi-Fi on,\nand you're in an area that\n\n302\n00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:04.310\ndoesn't have any Wi-Fi, your phone\nis basically doing the same thing.\n\n303\n00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:07.530\nBeaconing, trying to find any access\npoints so it can show you in the list, and\n\n304\n00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:08.580\nyou can pick it.\n\n305\n00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.070\nAnd you battery will die fast.\n\n306\n00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:13.020\nSo it's probably that\nsame principle there.\n\n307\n00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:17.612\n>> It's the exact same thing, and that's\nwhat they do on any notebook computer,\n\n308\n00:17:17.612 --> 00:17:18.785\nas a matter of fact.\n\n309\n00:17:18.785 --> 00:17:21.470\nWhen you plug into a battery,\nthe beacon's a lot faster.\n\n310\n00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:24.576\nYou will get a much more\nreliable wireless signal.\n\n311\n00:17:24.576 --> 00:17:29.680\nWhen wireless is turned, when you\nunplug it and your wireless is on,\n\n312\n00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.660\nit actually starts decreasing that beacon\nrate because it's trying to preserve that\n\n313\n00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:37.410\nbattery longer, but also give you\nthe ability to attach to wireless.\n\n314\n00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:42.030\nSo, it tries to make that balance itself,\nso you may have to do some fine tuning.\n\n315\n00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:45.515\nI have found the number that it puts\nin here is actually quite reasonable-\n\n316\n00:17:45.515 --> 00:17:46.572\n>> [COUGH]\n\n317\n00:17:46.572 --> 00:17:48.102\n>> And it does get you good results.\n\n318\n00:17:48.102 --> 00:17:50.090\nBut, you're gonna wanna\nmake sure when you do this,\n\n319\n00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:53.030\nthat the battery is charged up and\nready to go.\n\n320\n00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:56.680\nAnd think about when you're doing this,\nby the way, that where\n\n321\n00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.366\nyou're gonna hide something like this,\nbecause that's the other part of this.\n\n322\n00:18:00.366 --> 00:18:02.430\nI'm not just gonna go through and\nsay, oh hey,\n\n323\n00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:04.455\nI'm gonna leave it here on this desk and\nwalk away.\n\n324\n00:18:04.455 --> 00:18:06.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> More then likely,\n\n325\n00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.012\nyou're gonna take this thing.\n\n326\n00:18:08.012 --> 00:18:10.611\nYou're gonna take your device and\nsay, okay, well hey,\n\n327\n00:18:10.611 --> 00:18:14.930\nthere's a little shelf under here, and I'm\ngonna slide it under here and walk away.\n\n328\n00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:18.350\nAnd just let it sit there for\na while and start capturing.\n\n329\n00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:21.590\nCapturing things, and let the sniffer and\nall that do it's job.\n\n330\n00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:26.690\nI mean heck, once I've got that, we've\ngot stuff like dsniff that sits on these\n\n331\n00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:31.790\ndevices, that will actually just\nstart picking out SMTP passwords,\n\n332\n00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.340\nand FTP, and\nall those types of passwords if you want.\n\n333\n00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.580\nPlus, that's not the only one.\n\n334\n00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.380\nThere's other ones that do that as well.\n\n335\n00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.760\nSo, what you're looking to do,\n\n336\n00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.610\nplug it into a hardwired network, slide\nit someplace where no one's gonna see it.\n\n337\n00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:47.690\nAnd hopefully if the thing's charged up\nenough, it sits there for a good length\n\n338\n00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:52.720\nof time, or a length of time you think is\ngood, and gets the needed information.\n\n339\n00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.966\nAnd then you just come back later,\npick it up, and walk away, and\n\n340\n00:18:55.966 --> 00:18:59.058\nstart reading your logs,\ncuz it will log everything for you.\n\n341\n00:18:59.058 --> 00:19:01.929\n>> Now, we've been doing this compare and\n\n342\n00:19:01.929 --> 00:19:05.396\ncontrast between the NetHunter and\nthe PwnPad.\n\n343\n00:19:05.396 --> 00:19:09.698\nOnce you've got it set up, and\nyou've made that evil access point,\n\n344\n00:19:09.698 --> 00:19:12.903\nis there much difference,\nwhat I can do with them?\n\n345\n00:19:12.903 --> 00:19:15.322\nCuz really,\nit's a wireless network connection.\n\n346\n00:19:15.322 --> 00:19:17.851\nSo, either way I go,\nonce they're connected, I could,\n\n347\n00:19:17.851 --> 00:19:19.725\nthere's not much difference?\n\n348\n00:19:19.725 --> 00:19:21.124\n>> It's gonna appear\nthe same to your client.\n\n349\n00:19:21.124 --> 00:19:22.585\n>> Okay.\n\n350\n00:19:22.585 --> 00:19:27.443\n>> There may be some options that appears\non the PwdPad side with what it has,\n\n351\n00:19:27.443 --> 00:19:28.815\nas opposed to the other one.\n\n352\n00:19:28.815 --> 00:19:32.550\nBut once that's done, it appears\nexactly the same to your clients.\n\n353\n00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:33.590\nThey're not gonna know any difference.\n\n354\n00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.770\n>> And it's just a matter of what\ntools you have loaded on what device,\n\n355\n00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.770\nthat limits what you can do\nwith that person's traffic?\n\n356\n00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:39.960\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n357\n00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:40.740\n>> Very good.\n\n358\n00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.710\nAll right, well I'll tell you what, Sean.\n\n359\n00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:43.170\nAnother great episode.\n\n360\n00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:46.153\nGood look at something\ncalled evil access point,\n\n361\n00:19:46.153 --> 00:19:49.715\navailable both on Kali NetHunter,\nas well as that PwnPad.\n\n362\n00:19:49.715 --> 00:19:54.104\nGot to see them both configured, how those\nguys are set up, so we can start bringing\n\n363\n00:19:54.104 --> 00:19:59.010\nin that wireless traffic on our pen test,\nor whatever it is we're trying to do.\n\n364\n00:19:59.010 --> 00:19:59.620\nSo, good info.\n\n365\n00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.610\nAny parting thoughts for our viewers?\n\n366\n00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:04.085\n>> Yeah, hey,\ndon't start stealing people's stuff now.\n\n367\n00:20:04.085 --> 00:20:05.809\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I teach this stuff for evil.\n\n368\n00:20:05.809 --> 00:20:06.491\n>> That's right.\n\n369\n00:20:06.491 --> 00:20:08.860\n>> It's kinda fun though,\nI'll tell you what.\n\n370\n00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.500\nAnd let me tell you,\njust kind of a something in here,\n\n371\n00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:17.430\nit is kinda fun when you're\ntesting this out at home.\n\n372\n00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:21.820\nWhen I test this stuff out at home\nbriefly, when I got my Wi-Fi Pineapple,\n\n373\n00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.550\nand then I got these ones.\n\n374\n00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:27.790\nIt's a good thing to test, not just to\nget familiar with the equipment, but\n\n375\n00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:33.060\nto also see just how traumatic\nthis thing is, as far as\n\n376\n00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:38.070\nseizing probe requests and\nbringing them over here, so to speak.\n\n377\n00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:42.070\nOne of the times I remember doing it,\nI remember I was over my\n\n378\n00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:47.030\nex girlfriend's house, and I watched her\nTV go off, and then something else go off.\n\n379\n00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:53.330\nHer daughter was using some Wi-Fi on her\ncell phone, it was no longer working.\n\n380\n00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.270\nAnd I wasn't thinking.\n\n381\n00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:59.320\nI had the thing plugged in, configured\nsome stuff, and then I got distracted and\n\n382\n00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.830\nwas reading something else,\nand talking to someone else.\n\n383\n00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:03.373\nAnd then, why is the Internet not on?\n\n384\n00:21:03.373 --> 00:21:04.720\nWhy is the Internet not working?\n\n385\n00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.950\nThere's not a single TV\nin this house working.\n\n386\n00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:08.680\nOur cellphones cannot connect to Wi-Fi.\n\n387\n00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.590\nWe can get cell access, what's going on?\n\n388\n00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:11.852\nAnd she's like, Sean, what are you doing?\n\n389\n00:21:11.852 --> 00:21:13.695\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And she looks at me, and\n\n390\n00:21:13.695 --> 00:21:16.910\nI've got these wires and\nthe mad scientist look.\n\n391\n00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:18.245\nAnd I'm like, I'm not doing,\nokay never mind.\n\n392\n00:21:18.245 --> 00:21:21.196\n>> [LAUGH] I'm not even gonna\nbe able to get out of that one.\n\n393\n00:21:21.196 --> 00:21:23.690\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah I realized it,\nand was like oh, crap.\n\n394\n00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:24.890\nUnplug it.\n\n395\n00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:28.550\nIt took a few moments, but\nthen they started popping back up online.\n\n396\n00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:33.050\nIt's just amazing how quickly\nthese things can work.\n\n397\n00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:37.668\nIt was a dramatic thing, so I wouldn't\nrecommend doing what I did in there.\n\n398\n00:21:37.668 --> 00:21:40.315\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But if you're doing it at your own\n\n399\n00:21:40.315 --> 00:21:45.103\nhouse and trying it out, then it's\nactually something that shows you just\n\n400\n00:21:45.103 --> 00:21:48.686\nhow devastating this can be,\nor how dramatic it can be.\n\n401\n00:21:48.686 --> 00:21:50.640\n>> And\nyou mentioned the Wi-Fi Pineapple again.\n\n402\n00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.022\nIt's something we didn't mention I think,\nor\n\n403\n00:21:52.022 --> 00:21:53.610\nyou mentioned at\nthe beginning of the show.\n\n404\n00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:58.313\nKinda the same results, but this would\nbe a lot easier to conceal, right?\n\n405\n00:21:58.313 --> 00:22:01.030\nI mean, you had mentioned that\nthrough a few different episodes.\n\n406\n00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:05.210\nAgain, you could be sitting in the lobby\nof some place with your Kindle app open,\n\n407\n00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:07.480\njust collecting wireless traffic.\n\n408\n00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.395\nYou couldn't do that same\nthing with a Wi-Fi Pineapple.\n\n409\n00:22:10.395 --> 00:22:12.450\nYou got a box with antennas\nsticking out all over it.\n\n410\n00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.680\nThat might be a little more suspicious.\n\n411\n00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.530\n>> Yeah, and heck, like I said,\nif you wanna take it next level,\n\n412\n00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:22.120\nyou got PwnPad, and\nyou can put the phone, same thing.\n\n413\n00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.890\nSo this goes right in the pocket.\n\n414\n00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:28.810\nNow I've got an access point that's very,\nvery easy to conceal.\n\n415\n00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:32.750\nAnd in my case, I can turn this\ninto a needle access point,\n\n416\n00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.210\nbecause it has it on there.\n\n417\n00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.525\nBut it's also, I do use this as\nmy cell phone all the time too.\n\n418\n00:22:37.525 --> 00:22:41.116\nIts got calls, so I can be sitting there\nin the lobby going, talking like this, and\n\n419\n00:22:41.116 --> 00:22:42.829\npop, pop, pop, stuff's coming on.\n\n420\n00:22:42.829 --> 00:22:44.324\nThey're just going to\nthink I'm making a call.\n\n421\n00:22:44.324 --> 00:22:46.064\nAll I've gotta do, is so and so here?\n\n422\n00:22:46.064 --> 00:22:47.372\nOkay, can you check?\n\n423\n00:22:47.372 --> 00:22:50.721\nAnd meanwhile,\nI'm harvesting stuff in there.\n\n424\n00:22:50.721 --> 00:22:53.310\nThey're not gonna notice\nanything different on there.\n\n425\n00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:55.790\nIt's very, very simple,\nand that's something that\n\n426\n00:22:55.790 --> 00:23:00.390\nthe cell phone has as an advantage over\na tablet sitting there reading it.\n\n427\n00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:01.650\nWell, who are you looking for?\n\n428\n00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:02.430\nWho are you looking for?\n\n429\n00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:06.776\nYou can't say, well you could, but it's a\nlot harder to say, blah, blah, blah, blah,\n\n430\n00:23:06.776 --> 00:23:09.220\nand act like you're distracted and\npreoccupied.\n\n431\n00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.420\nThis, I'm like, what?\n\n432\n00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.633\nHold, hold on.\n\n433\n00:23:11.633 --> 00:23:13.829\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They expected that.\n\n434\n00:23:13.829 --> 00:23:15.773\nThey expect those sorts of things, so\n\n435\n00:23:15.773 --> 00:23:18.640\nthat's something that\nyou can build into that.\n\n436\n00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.200\n>> Very cool, very cool stuff.\n\n437\n00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.170\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n438\n00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:25.080\nA lot of great stuff there, Sean.\n\n439\n00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:25.980\nHope you guys enjoyed it.\n\n440\n00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.900\nI know we enjoyed filming it.\n\n441\n00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.320\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n442\n00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.350\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n443\n00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:32.420\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n444\n00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:36.998\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:15.000\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.950\nWith me today is Mr Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.140\nIn this episode,\nSean's gonna help us take a look at\n\n6\n00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.630\na man in the middle attack using\nsomething called SSL strip.\n\n7\n00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.920\nSo Sean tell us about this.\n\n8\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.460\nMan in the middle, we probably should\nbe familiar with this concept,\n\n9\n00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.260\nman in the middle, sitting in between\na conversation and intercepting traffic,\n\n10\n00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.210\nand maybe just sniffing it, maybe\nmodifying it, or something like that.\n\n11\n00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.770\nBut SSL Strip, how does that fit in here?\n\n12\n00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.820\n>> Well,\nit's a way of actually bumping up or\n\n13\n00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.020\nstepping up the ante on\nman in the middle attacks.\n\n14\n00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.630\nAs you should already know, a man in the\nmiddle is, like Mike was saying, you got\n\n15\n00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.810\ntwo points that are having a conversation,\nand you've got something right,\n\n16\n00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.970\nsomeone sitting right in the middle,\nanother party, us,\n\n17\n00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.690\nthat are actually intercepting those\ncommunications, and passing them through.\n\n18\n00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.800\nNow they could be just passively\nletting those things go by, or they\n\n19\n00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.610\ncould be actively doing something, that's\nreally kind of up to you at that point.\n\n20\n00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.910\nWhat we're gonna be seeing here is,\n\n21\n00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.480\nwe're gonna see a way that we can\nactually do both, if we want.\n\n22\n00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.520\nWe can take the active role or\nthe passive, sit back, and watch role.\n\n23\n00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.120\nSo it's a pretty interesting proposition.\n\n24\n00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.238\nWhat really bumps us up is that,\nit's something that the PWN Pad has,\n\n25\n00:01:35.238 --> 00:01:38.540\nbut like I said, bumps up the ante.\n\n26\n00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.060\nAnd how does it bump up the ante?\n\n27\n00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.900\nWell, pay attention to what\nthe name of this thing is,\n\n28\n00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.910\nit's called SSL Strip for a reason.\n\n29\n00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.640\n>> I was just gonna say, I can\nprevent that man in the middle attack,\n\n30\n00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.410\nI'm just gonna encrypt my traffic,\nI'm gonna use SSL.\n\n31\n00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.751\nThat way you can intercept it\nall you want, you can't read it.\n\n32\n00:01:52.751 --> 00:01:54.110\nIt's gonna be [CROSSTALK].\n\n33\n00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.509\n>> No, you're not.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n34\n00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.942\n>> So I've taken it that you're gonna be\n\n35\n00:02:01.942 --> 00:02:07.590\nremoving my protection, and leaving me\nout there exposed for the world to see.\n\n36\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.440\n>> Yeah, pretty much.\n\n37\n00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.047\nThat's what the objective here is to do,\nis to remove that SSL capability,\n\n38\n00:02:15.047 --> 00:02:19.914\nand it's not like you think,\nlet me put that out there.\n\n39\n00:02:19.914 --> 00:02:21.419\nWhen I describe it,\n\n40\n00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:26.912\nyou'll see it's a little bit different\nthan what you think, cuz you're\n\n41\n00:02:26.912 --> 00:02:32.329\nthinking it's like how does he get\na tool to take SSL off of a connection.\n\n42\n00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.790\nWell we're gonna clear\nthat up because it's the,\n\n43\n00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.340\nI know there's probably already\nthings going through people's minds,\n\n44\n00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.850\nabout well that doesn't sound\nlike something that can happen.\n\n45\n00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.350\nWell, no, not the way you're thinking,\nbut let me talk about that.\n\n46\n00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.350\nWhat you may be thinking, right now,\nis that you have a client, and\n\n47\n00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.470\nyou're talking to server, and\nthat's an SSL encrypted session,\n\n48\n00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.970\nand I'm jumping in the middle of it,\nand peeling away that SSL layer.\n\n49\n00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:58.796\nIt's not overdoing.\n\n50\n00:02:58.796 --> 00:03:04.060\nWe are, actually,\nlooking for SSL sessions,\n\n51\n00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.900\nstuff that are using HTTPS, and then\nwhat we're doing is intercepting those\n\n52\n00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.980\nrequests, prior to them getting to\nthe server, so we're causing them, or\n\n53\n00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.400\nfooling them into, actually, sending that\nrequest out, we intercept the request.\n\n54\n00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.584\nAnd then, we either pass it through to the\nlegitimate target, or we have it set up,\n\n55\n00:03:24.584 --> 00:03:28.952\nthe target on the other side is an HTTP\nsite, so we just go through, and\n\n56\n00:03:28.952 --> 00:03:33.421\nthey connect to us, using, or\nthey try to connect to us, using HTTPs.\n\n57\n00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:38.599\nOr connect to their target using Agent PS,\nbut they get through us, we take that\n\n58\n00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.778\nSSL request, peel it off, and just forward\nit right on through the other side,\n\n59\n00:03:43.778 --> 00:03:49.139\nto something that's using HTTP, a URL\nthat we created, or some other location.\n\n60\n00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.263\nAnd so, it's not peeling it\noff in an existing session,\n\n61\n00:03:52.263 --> 00:03:56.689\nit's preventing that session from\noccurring, and then fooling the user into,\n\n62\n00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.443\nactually, believing\nthat everything's fine.\n\n63\n00:03:59.443 --> 00:04:02.811\n>> They might still have that little\nS at the end of their HTTP up there.\n\n64\n00:04:02.811 --> 00:04:03.808\n>> They might.\n\n65\n00:04:03.808 --> 00:04:08.111\n>> Might still have that lock up in their\nbrowser or whatever indicator they've got,\n\n66\n00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:11.160\nbut they really didn't ever\nhave a secure connection.\n\n67\n00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.947\n>> Yeah, under certain conditions\nthat would still appear up there, and\n\n68\n00:04:15.947 --> 00:04:17.938\nthe way I look at it really is,\n\n69\n00:04:17.938 --> 00:04:22.639\neven if you look at the fact that if I\nmapped you over to an HTTP site, and\n\n70\n00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.701\nthat lock did disappear, how many people\ndo you think really look at that?\n\n71\n00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:29.514\n>> Most people don't, they really don't.\n\n72\n00:04:29.514 --> 00:04:30.163\n>> Yeah, so.\n\n73\n00:04:30.163 --> 00:04:31.440\n>> They should, but they don't.\n\n74\n00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.752\n>> Yeah, we tell them all these safety\nthings and security awareness things,\n\n75\n00:04:36.752 --> 00:04:40.829\nand they're probably not paying\nattention to most of it.\n\n76\n00:04:40.829 --> 00:04:45.923\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ntake a look at how this takes place,\n\n77\n00:04:45.923 --> 00:04:51.350\nit's actually incredibly and\ndeceptively simple on what's going on.\n\n78\n00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:57.030\nSo what we have here is,\nI'm gonna have my Pwn Pad, once again.\n\n79\n00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.352\nSo I have my Pwn Pad sitting here.\n\n80\n00:05:01.352 --> 00:05:04.520\nAnd I'm slide that up front and\ncenter, here a bit, for you.\n\n81\n00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.740\nSo what you're gonna do is,\nwe have our various tools.\n\n82\n00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.840\nWhat we see is, we see the little guy\nasking for a passport right there.\n\n83\n00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.330\nSo that's our SSL Strip deal, and\nthat brings up this menu right here.\n\n84\n00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.180\nNow, again, based on the situation that\nwe're in, I'm showing you the tool,\n\n85\n00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.278\nand telling you what it does, but\nwe're gonna play on the safe side.\n\n86\n00:05:29.278 --> 00:05:32.870\nI don't wanna all of a sudden do this\nbecause we do have a live network here.\n\n87\n00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.724\nI do not wanna start doing this, and\nthere's other people in the building,\n\n88\n00:05:35.724 --> 00:05:38.845\nall of a sudden, someone's credit card\nnumber comes across that's different.\n\n89\n00:05:38.845 --> 00:05:40.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I don't wanna start\n\n90\n00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.810\nintercepting things, and\nhave them display here.\n\n91\n00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.760\nSo we're gonna set it up, and\nshow you just how easy it is.\n\n92\n00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.830\nOkay, so what this is gonna do is when you\n\n93\n00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.540\nplug this thing into a network,\neither connect it to a wireless network or\n\n94\n00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.650\na wired network, what's gonna happen is\nis it's gonna start looking for requests.\n\n95\n00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.320\nSo what it's asking here for\nyou, is that first of all,\n\n96\n00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.580\npresumably you'd have your\ngood old wired connection or\n\n97\n00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.860\nwireless connection to the Internet,\nusing whatever.\n\n98\n00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.230\nAnd then, you've got another\ninterface that you're gonna sniff on.\n\n99\n00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.330\nSo what you're gonna do is,\nI have this list here,\n\n100\n00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.560\nthe list here has my ethernet connections,\ntwo WLAN connections.\n\n101\n00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.080\nAnd the reason why it has two WLANs,\neven though there isn't another one\n\n102\n00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.540\nplugged in here is,\nit's recognizing the internal one.\n\n103\n00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.560\nAnd then, it's also optimized and\nprogrammed, this is the Pwn Pad after all,\n\n104\n00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.480\nto use that TP-LINK device, so\nthey've already coded it in there.\n\n105\n00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.360\nSo we've got that plus\na couple other ones.\n\n106\n00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.710\nWhat's it's asking me is which one\ndo you want to do your sniffing on?\n\n107\n00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.540\nRight now, none of these interfaces\nwould actually work for sniffing,\n\n108\n00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.367\neven though it's recognizing\nthe ones internally,\n\n109\n00:06:53.367 --> 00:06:57.135\nthose internal ones aren't gonna\nwork because remember what we said,\n\n110\n00:06:57.135 --> 00:07:01.249\nthose WiFI ones, typically, are limited\non the capabilities internally.\n\n111\n00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:05.353\nSo it means we would have to get\nsomething like this, to do this,\n\n112\n00:07:05.353 --> 00:07:08.050\nif we're gonna sniff on wireless.\n\n113\n00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:14.210\nSo what to do now at this point is,\nall we'd have to do, and this is,\n\n114\n00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:19.420\nliterally, how easy it is, you wanna sniff\non interface, let's say I wanna sniff on,\n\n115\n00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:25.220\nif I had my wired adaptor plugged\nout here, I could say ETH 0,\n\n116\n00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.430\nwhich is actually one right there.\n\n117\n00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.900\nHit enter, and it's gonna go ahead,\nand start this thing up.\n\n118\n00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:39.890\nAnd once it goes ahead and starts this\nthing up, now what's gonna happen is that,\n\n119\n00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.980\nwhen credentials start\npassing over the wire, and\n\n120\n00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.470\nit picks up a session,\nit will intercept it, and\n\n121\n00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:53.860\nredirect it to a HTTP site,\nif it can, to an HTTP site.\n\n122\n00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.540\nYou could actually if you want, I am not\ngonna worry about doing that here, but\n\n123\n00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.180\nif you really wanted to, you actually can\ngo in the configuration file for this, and\n\n124\n00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:07.170\ntell if it sees certain sites, GP or\nHTTP requests going to certain sites.\n\n125\n00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.561\nThey intercept those and\nredirect them to very specific sites.\n\n126\n00:08:10.561 --> 00:08:15.279\nSo if you had someone going to the Bank\nof America website, let's say,\n\n127\n00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:20.701\nthey go to Bank of America, and they go to\nlog into their account, it switches over\n\n128\n00:08:20.701 --> 00:08:25.913\nHTTPs, you would just look to see what\nURL that is that switches over to HTTPs.\n\n129\n00:08:25.913 --> 00:08:29.148\nSo they go to Bank of America site,\nthey're browsing services and\n\n130\n00:08:29.148 --> 00:08:33.247\nproducts that that business offers, then\nthey said, oh, well, let me go ahead and\n\n131\n00:08:33.247 --> 00:08:35.592\nlog into my bank account,\nthey click on login.\n\n132\n00:08:35.592 --> 00:08:39.610\nYou're gonna get that URL and\nconfigure this to look for that.\n\n133\n00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.690\nAnd when someone clicks and\nit goes to that URL,\n\n134\n00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.680\nthis thing will intercept that\nrequest because it's sniffing it, and\n\n135\n00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.010\nI could have it redirect to a page that\nI have that looks like that log in page.\n\n136\n00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.600\nThey type their credentials in a couple\ntimes and the script captures those, and\n\n137\n00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.550\nthen forwards them on back to\nthe normal site, and I've got them.\n\n138\n00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.780\nI've got their credentials.\n\n139\n00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.980\n>> And for most users,\nif a logon page like that glitches once or\n\n140\n00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.790\ntwice, the glitch was once,\nmost people do what?\n\n141\n00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.298\nReenter their credentials and\nhit login one more time,\n\n142\n00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:12.974\nthat bumped them out to the real site, now\nthey actually log into Bank of America,\n\n143\n00:09:12.974 --> 00:09:16.222\nand they go, oh, that was just a little\ntemporary glitch, no big deal,\n\n144\n00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.985\nbut in the mean time,\nSean's captured their credentials.\n\n145\n00:09:18.985 --> 00:09:20.924\n>> Yeah, I have personally\ncaptured their credentials.\n\n146\n00:09:20.924 --> 00:09:23.583\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'll take credit for it.\n\n147\n00:09:23.583 --> 00:09:24.790\nI don't care.\n\n148\n00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.842\nSo that's what this thing would\ngo through and do for ya.\n\n149\n00:09:28.842 --> 00:09:29.774\nAnd you could,\n\n150\n00:09:29.774 --> 00:09:34.523\nit's a scary proposition that you've\ngot something like that in your hands.\n\n151\n00:09:34.523 --> 00:09:39.068\nAnd again, you've got on the Pwn Pad,\nyou can put it on the phone, and it can\n\n152\n00:09:39.068 --> 00:09:44.380\nintercept those requests, and now you've\ngot all sorts of fun and games happening.\n\n153\n00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.600\n>> And I can't tell you how many times\nI've said, you walk through Starbucks,\n\n154\n00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.860\nor through a hotel lobby, or\n\n155\n00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:53.650\nthrough the airport, people are doing\nbanking online in these public hot spots.\n\n156\n00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:58.390\nThey're sitting at the burger joint, and\nthey're checking their bank account,\n\n157\n00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.020\nor they're ordering something.\n\n158\n00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.790\nSo they're entering in credit card\nnumbers, and things like that.\n\n159\n00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.800\nAnd with this,\nwho's gonna even know, right?\n\n160\n00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.300\nHe's sitting there with his Pwn Pad.\n\n161\n00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.720\nLooks like he's reading the news or\nsomething.\n\n162\n00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.472\nAnd, yeah, not so much.\n\n163\n00:10:12.472 --> 00:10:14.629\n>> I'm reading your news,\nthat's what I'm doing.\n\n164\n00:10:14.629 --> 00:10:20.306\nIt's something that makes me worry.\n\n165\n00:10:20.306 --> 00:10:22.298\nThis is the social part of it,\n\n166\n00:10:22.298 --> 00:10:26.603\nis you mentioned at the very\nbeginning about logs and HTTPs, and\n\n167\n00:10:26.603 --> 00:10:31.650\nall that showing up, and it makes me\nthink, you think about those things.\n\n168\n00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:35.155\nIt's like okay,\nsomeone is supposed to be looking for\n\n169\n00:10:35.155 --> 00:10:38.810\nthose things,\nwe've taught people that for years, and\n\n170\n00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:44.320\npeople are less than diligent in doing\nthat, but let's add another layer to it.\n\n171\n00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.260\nThe newer, you've got newer systems,\n\n172\n00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.080\nyour mobile devices,\nyou've got Windows 8 started this.\n\n173\n00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.780\nAnd I believe it's the same way in 10,\nthat they open up the browser full screen,\n\n174\n00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.230\nso they don't emphasize the URL address\nbar across the top anymore, and all that.\n\n175\n00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.403\nSo people aren't really paying attention\nto that as much as they used to,\n\n176\n00:11:00.403 --> 00:11:02.258\nif they ever really paid attention at all.\n\n177\n00:11:02.258 --> 00:11:05.270\nThey type an address in and\nhit enter, they're busy,\n\n178\n00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:09.264\ntheir eyes go from up here to down here\nto the main body of the content, and\n\n179\n00:11:09.264 --> 00:11:11.113\nit's not going down here at all.\n\n180\n00:11:11.113 --> 00:11:13.180\nThey don't really pay\nattention to those icons.\n\n181\n00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.660\nIf I tell someone,\nthere's a lock icon on your task bar?\n\n182\n00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:18.439\nReally, where's that,\nI haven't seen that ever.\n\n183\n00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.700\nSo that's why a tool like\nthis can be effective about\n\n184\n00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.720\ncapturing credentials, deceiving somebody.\n\n185\n00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.250\nIt's incredibly easy, did it really\ntake me that long to set that up?\n\n186\n00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:33.670\nIt didn't at all.\n\n187\n00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:37.010\nYeah, I could've done that additional\nconfiguration, but it was irrelevant for\n\n188\n00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:37.618\nright now.\n\n189\n00:11:37.618 --> 00:11:41.940\nIt was just for me to get in the game,\nand start intercepting those things.\n\n190\n00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:48.150\nSo, a very, very powerful\nutility to have in your arsenal.\n\n191\n00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:53.020\nHardwired, wireless connection,\nyou're gonna be capturing that,\n\n192\n00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.601\nand it's just a great thing for\nyou to be aware of.\n\n193\n00:11:57.601 --> 00:12:00.970\nFYI, when you look at a tool like that,\n\n194\n00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:05.040\nit's like well how could I\ndefeat this type of tool?\n\n195\n00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.740\nWell, I'm not gonna tell you\nbecause I'm gonna steal your stuff.\n\n196\n00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:14.610\nWell, and in reality, defeating these\ntools, they actually have something\n\n197\n00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:19.830\ncalled HSTS for,\nthat's gonna be a replacement for,\n\n198\n00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:23.790\nor they want to see as a replacement for\nSSL and TSL,\n\n199\n00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:28.130\nwhich should block some of this because\nthere's more checking and all that done.\n\n200\n00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.100\nSo that should be something that\ngoes a long way towards this.\n\n201\n00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.563\nSomething else is something\nI have on my cell phone,\n\n202\n00:12:34.563 --> 00:12:39.170\nI've got on my Nexus 5, is,\nyeah, I have SSL Strip on there.\n\n203\n00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.910\nI also have something else that's\ncalled SSL Detect, that I turn it on,\n\n204\n00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.280\nit'll tell me immediately if\nsomeone' trying to run that attack.\n\n205\n00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.010\nIt'll flag it immediately.\n\n206\n00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:51.030\nIt'll come up with a little\nicon telling you hey,\n\n207\n00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:55.480\nthere's somebody running SSL Strip,\nis out there some place.\n\n208\n00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.790\nSo I can sit there and say, okay,\nI'm not playing games, and shut that down.\n\n209\n00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.313\n>> Right, yeah, I'm not gonna put my\ncredit card number in at that point.\n\n210\n00:13:03.313 --> 00:13:04.196\n>> Yeah.\n\n211\n00:13:04.196 --> 00:13:05.438\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or I can hunt them down and.\n\n212\n00:13:05.438 --> 00:13:09.404\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> With the other tools I have on there,\n\n213\n00:13:09.404 --> 00:13:12.860\nand so it's really, really easy.\n\n214\n00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:17.335\nScary easy to do, and the purpose of this\nis to show you, you can do stuff with this\n\n215\n00:13:17.335 --> 00:13:22.250\nPwn Pad right out of the box,\nthat's pretty vicious when you look at it.\n\n216\n00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:26.720\n>> Absolutely, and we've said several\ntimes how deceptive it is, because\n\n217\n00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.170\nit's just a tablet, as Sean said, it's\nnot like you've got a laptop with antenna\n\n218\n00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:35.240\npoking out everywhere, and hacker symbols\nall over the back or anything like that?\n\n219\n00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.430\nIt's just a seven inch tablet,\nhow can that be harmful?\n\n220\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.260\n>> Although I'd love something with all\nthose symbols on it, that'd be awesome.\n\n221\n00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:44.971\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well Sean, another\ngreat episode there, any parting thoughts?\n\n222\n00:13:44.971 --> 00:13:48.700\nI guess we've told them what they need\nto know to keep yourself safe but.\n\n223\n00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:54.130\n>> Yeah,\nit's just something else on the Pwn Pad,\n\n224\n00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:57.160\ntelling you, just giving you,\nshowing you one of the tools that can,\n\n225\n00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.180\nhow easy it is to set up\nto run an SSL Strip attack.\n\n226\n00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:06.290\nAnd, heck, you can try it out on your\nown network, and set up your own\n\n227\n00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:11.490\nSSL based system, and try intercepting\ncredentials, and see what happens.\n\n228\n00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.690\nIt absolutely does work, and\nit's frightening how easy it is.\n\n229\n00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.710\nHow quickly and easily it works.\n\n230\n00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.730\n>> All right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n231\n00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:24.704\nWe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n232\n00:14:24.704 --> 00:14:27.431\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n233\n00:14:27.431 --> 00:14:28.453\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n234\n00:14:28.453 --> 00:14:29.684\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n235\n00:14:29.684 --> 00:14:30.184\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
