neutral,\n\n3\n00:00:09.594 --> 00:00:11.930\ncertification exam, known as Security+.\n\n4\n00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.860\nWe will, in the overview,\ndive into, well what is Security+?\n\n5\n00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.715\nAs well as, who is this course for?\n\n6\n00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:21.510\nWe'll also be looking at some of the\ntopics that you can expect to be covered\n\n7\n00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.720\ninside of the Security+ series.\n\n8\n00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.530\nAnd, finally, we'll be looking\nat some of the exam details so\n\n9\n00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.940\nwhen you decide to take\nthat certification exam and\n\n10\n00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.620\nsit the hot seat there,\nyou'll be a little bit better prepared.\n\n11\n00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.350\nSo, let's go ahead, and let's talk about,\nwell, what is Security+ to begin with?\n\n12\n00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.400\nWell, Security+,\nI said is a worldwide accreditation.\n\n13\n00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.300\nIt's recognized, just by about\n126 different countries, or more,\n\n14\n00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.520\nacross the entire globe.\n\n15\n00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.393\nIt is the benchmark for the best\npractices that we see in IT security.\n\n16\n00:00:52.393 --> 00:00:56.898\nIt's also recognized by\ninternational standards bodies, so\n\n17\n00:00:56.898 --> 00:01:01.404\nthe International Organization\nof Standardization has an ISO\n\n18\n00:01:01.404 --> 00:01:04.133\naccreditation known as 17024.\n\n19\n00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:09.120\nIt's also FISMA compliant too, the Federal\nInformation Security Management Act.\n\n20\n00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.495\nIt's also recognized by the US Military,\nas well.\n\n21\n00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:16.524\nSo keep in mind, if this is something\nthat you want to be involved in,\n\n22\n00:01:16.524 --> 00:01:22.100\nthese are some of the things that you\ncan expect to see inside of Security+.\n\n23\n00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.770\nAll right, so who is Security+ for?\n\n24\n00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.930\nWell, anybody who is\nan aspiring IT professional.\n\n25\n00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.930\nIf you are looking to learn how\nto secure information systems,\n\n26\n00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.820\nthen Security+ is for you.\n\n27\n00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.430\nIf you're seeking certification, well,\nthen this is the right series for you.\n\n28\n00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.990\nIt could be that maybe you're just\nseeking current security techniques and\n\n29\n00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.940\ntechnologies.\n\n30\n00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:51.760\nAnd if that's the case, then the Security+\nSY0501 exam is going to be where it's at.\n\n31\n00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.137\nNext, what are we going to\ncover inside of this exam.\n\n32\n00:01:56.137 --> 00:01:58.984\nWell I kind of mentioned, briefly there,\n\n33\n00:01:58.984 --> 00:02:02.790\nthe exam code these are the new\nobjectives as of October.\n\n34\n00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.470\nThis is the objectives for exam SY0501.\n\n35\n00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.150\nWe're gonna be looking at things like\nthe fundamental IT security concepts.\n\n36\n00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.580\nWe'll also be taking a look at some of\nthe principle risk management concepts.\n\n37\n00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.300\nThings like the host based and\nnetwork based security techniques.\n\n38\n00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.600\nAs well as things like your introductory\ncompliance and operational concepts.\n\n39\n00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.930\nWe'll also be looking at different\nthings like threats and vulnerabilities.\n\n40\n00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.220\nWe'll be looking at, not only threats and\nvulnerabilities, but also attacks.\n\n41\n00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.290\nWe'll look at some of the technologies and\n\n42\n00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.540\ntools you can expect to see if you're\nmaking your way into an IT security field.\n\n43\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.930\nWe'll also be looking at\nthings like architecture and\n\n44\n00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.020\ndesign, very important in\ntoday's information systems.\n\n45\n00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.840\nWe'll be looking at identity and\naccess management,\n\n46\n00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.020\na very important concept today when we\ntalk about enterprise based networks.\n\n47\n00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.890\nAs well as the basics\nof risk management and\n\n48\n00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.640\nthen finally we'll be talking about\ncryptology and public key infrastructure.\n\n49\n00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.530\nNow, if you are getting into the exam,\n\n50\n00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.760\nthere's some things you\nmight need to know about it.\n\n51\n00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.420\nOne of the things that we\nwant to look at is that\n\n52\n00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.010\nthe exam format is 90\nquestions in 90 minutes.\n\n53\n00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.060\nIt's multiple choice or\nperformance-based questions.\n\n54\n00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.920\nWhen we look at performance-based\nquestions, understand that that does imply\n\n55\n00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.770\nthat there could be simulations,\nso be prepared for that.\n\n56\n00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.493\nNow the passing score for\nyour Security+ exam is gonna be 750 and\n\n57\n00:03:27.493 --> 00:03:30.835\nthat's a passing score out\nof a range from 100 to 900.\n\n58\n00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:35.678\nAs far as we know right now,\nthe Security+ exam\n\n59\n00:03:35.678 --> 00:03:40.620\nis going to cost you $320 U.S. dollars.\n\n60\n00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.560\nIt is recommended that you\nhave CompTIA's Net+ and\n\n61\n00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.370\ntwo year's IT administration experience.\n\n62\n00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.400\nHowever, keep in mind that\nthat is recommend but\n\n63\n00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.610\nit is not a necessity before hand.\n\n64\n00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.710\nIt's not a pre-requisite to you taking the\nactual exam, it's just a recommendation.\n\n65\n00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.720\nSo, if these are some of the concepts and\n\n66\n00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.884\nthese are some of the goals that you\nhave to become IT security certified and\n\n67\n00:04:03.884 --> 00:04:07.580\nprove the knowledge that\nyou have competency and\n\n68\n00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.810\nsecurity techniques in how to\nsecure information systems,\n\n69\n00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.372\nthen the CompTIA Security+ SY0501\nseries is for you.\n\n70\n00:04:15.372 -->
