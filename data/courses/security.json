          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.728\n[SOUND] In this video,\n\n2\n00:00:01.728 --> 00:00:07.183\nwe're gonna take a look at\nthe CompTIA Security+ certification.\n\n3\n00:00:07.183 --> 00:00:11.433\nIf you're not familiar with it, the\nSecurity+ certification is an intermediate\n\n4\n00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:15.684\nlevel cert from CompTIA and is designed to\nshow that you have the relevant knowledge\n\n5\n00:00:15.684 --> 00:00:18.760\nand skills to function\nas a IT security worker.\n\n6\n00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.660\nIT security is extremely\nimportant these days.\n\n7\n00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.710\nIt’s a rare that a week goes by that you\ndon't hear about a company being hacked or\n\n8\n00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.140\nhaving their credit card database stolen.\n\n9\n00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.160\nAnd it’s really becoming a big, major\nissue and companies are recognizing that.\n\n10\n00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.260\nAnd so more and\nmore people are becoming IT workers.\n\n11\n00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.750\nIT security workers.\n\n12\n00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.320\nAnd if you wanna work in the security\nfield, where do you get started?\n\n13\n00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.475\nWell, the Security+ certification\nis really the best place for that.\n\n14\n00:00:44.475 --> 00:00:48.376\nSecurity+ is not gonna teach you\nhow to break into a web server and\n\n15\n00:00:48.376 --> 00:00:51.650\nhow to protect the credit card\ndatabase all by yourself.\n\n16\n00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.330\nWhat is gonna teach you are the\nfundamental skills that you need to\n\n17\n00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.285\nunderstand before you're able to move to\nthat level, to the more advanced levels.\n\n18\n00:01:00.285 --> 00:01:03.340\nSecurity+ is really designed for\nalmost everyone.\n\n19\n00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.690\nIt is a hard exam, so you don't\nnecessarily want the male room clerk or\n\n20\n00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.158\nthe cafeteria workers to be able to go and\nget the Security+ certification.\n\n21\n00:01:13.158 --> 00:01:15.900\nBut if you work in IT,\nif you're a systems admin or\n\n22\n00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.060\na network admin somebody like that and\nsecurity falls under your per view,\n\n23\n00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.540\nwell this is something that\nyou really need to know.\n\n24\n00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.520\nBut if you're going to be focused as\na penetration tester, as a IT security\n\n25\n00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.180\nauditor, as a security officer,\nSecurity+ is really a requirement.\n\n26\n00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.860\nThis is foundational knowledge\nthat everyone working in IT\n\n27\n00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.350\nsecurity should have.\n\n28\n00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.220\nLet's take a look at CompTIA's\ncareer road map, right?\n\n29\n00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.710\nCompTIA likes to map all\ncertifications to particular careers.\n\n30\n00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.480\nAnd the very top career field\nis information security,\n\n31\n00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.940\nit's on top for a reason.\n\n32\n00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.140\nIt's on top because there is a lack\nof IT security workers right now.\n\n33\n00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.150\nCompanies are trying to hire\nas many as they can, and\n\n34\n00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.570\nthere just aren't enough\nof them out there.\n\n35\n00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.351\nWell, if you look the beginner and\nnovice level for\n\n36\n00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:02.800\nthat is the IT fundamentals and\nA+ certification that we've seen before.\n\n37\n00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.150\nBut as you move to the intermediate level\nlook at the amount of certifications\n\n38\n00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.170\nthat are available.\n\n39\n00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.680\nThere's Cisco certification.\n\n40\n00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.830\nThere's one's from (ISC)² and\nEC council and other vendors like that.\n\n41\n00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.270\nAnd CompTIA has a number\nof certifications also.\n\n42\n00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.690\nAnd the one that I'm talking\nabout right now is Security+.\n\n43\n00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.850\nNow, you'll also notice that CompTIA CSA+,\nso the Cybersecurity analyst+.\n\n44\n00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.780\nWhy two certifications at the same level?\n\n45\n00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.195\nWell they're actually\na little bit different.\n\n46\n00:02:31.195 --> 00:02:34.650\nSecurity+ is fundamentals, right?\n\n47\n00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.780\nGeneral concepts, theory,\n\n48\n00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.625\nknowledge that everyone should have\nthat's working in IT security.\n\n49\n00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:43.930\nCSA+ is a little more practical,\na little more hands on.\n\n50\n00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.670\nSo actually understanding how\nattacks are pulled off and\n\n51\n00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.840\nhow to protect those servers and\ngoing that extra step.\n\n52\n00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.450\nThat's important also if you're\nthe actual security worker, right?\n\n53\n00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.722\nIf you're a network admin, that knowledge\nisn't necessarily relevant to you,\n\n54\n00:02:57.722 --> 00:02:59.540\nSecurity+ is.\n\n55\n00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.310\nBut if you are a penetration tester or\na security officer\n\n56\n00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.170\nyou wanna do a Security+ and the CSA+,\nboth of them go together really well.\n\n57\n00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.110\nBut Security+ is the starting point.\n\n58\n00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.870\nIt's the intermediate level the one that\nwe kind of kick off with in security.\n\n59\n00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.660\nAnd then we move up to the advanced\nlevel and beyond from there, right?\n\n60\n00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.590\nWell let's talk a little bit about\nwhat's on the certification, right?\n\n61\n00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.120\nCompTIA publishes all of the exam\nobjectors rights on their website.\n\n62\n00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.480\nYou can go to CompTIA.org\nto pull the full list.\n\n63\n00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.340\nThis exact document that\nI'm looking at right here.\n\n64\n00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.880\nAnd what they do is they\ntake all the topics and\n\n65\n00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.980\nthey divide them up into domains.\n\n66\n00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.380\nAnd so I've got the different\ndomains pulled up on my screen here.\n\n67\n00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.830\nSix different domains.\n\n68\n00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.670\nSome are more important than others,\nright?\n\n69\n00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.680\nWhere some of them make up 20% of\nthe exam, others make up just 12%, right?\n\n70\n00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.750\nSo they've geared it based on\nthe importance level of the knowledge\n\n71\n00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.720\nin the career, right?\n\n72\n00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.210\nAnd they start with network security.\n\n73\n00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.580\nIf your network is not secured it doesn't\nmatter how much effort you put behind\n\n74\n00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.410\nsecuring your workstations and servers.\n\n75\n00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.520\nYour network has been compromised.\n\n76\n00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.990\nYour data will be caught in transit.\n\n77\n00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.910\nSo, securing a network is\nwhere they kick it off.\n\n78\n00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.570\nHow do we protect data in motion?\n\n79\n00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.260\nIn domain two, Compliance and\nOperational Security.\n\n80\n00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.790\nThis is really important.\n\n81\n00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.390\nYou might have government\nagencies that have restrictions,\n\n82\n00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.310\nthat have regulations in place\nthat you need to follow.\n\n83\n00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.800\nOr you might just internally have your\nown requirements for any network gear or\n\n84\n00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.980\nservers or workstations that are on\nyour network, you have these rules for\n\n85\n00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.370\nhow they get secured.\n\n86\n00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.620\nWell, a lot of us do a great job\nof securing the devices at first.\n\n87\n00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.150\nBut then they get deployed and\nthey run for\n\n88\n00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.655\nsix months and they start getting less.\n\n89\n00:04:32.655 --> 00:04:35.885\nAnd less secure as people mess with them,\nso how do we make sure that we maintain\n\n90\n00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:38.825\ncompliance, what kind of\nprocesses do we need in place?\n\n91\n00:04:38.825 --> 00:04:41.175\nThat's what covered in domain two.\n\n92\n00:04:41.175 --> 00:04:43.805\nIn domain three we have threats and\nvulnerabilities.\n\n93\n00:04:43.805 --> 00:04:46.082\nIf you're going to\nprotect your environment,\n\n94\n00:04:46.082 --> 00:04:48.502\nyou need to know what\nyou're protecting it from.\n\n95\n00:04:48.502 --> 00:04:50.952\nAnd so we address all the different\nthreats that are out there.\n\n96\n00:04:50.952 --> 00:04:53.932\nSome of the vulnerabilities, the\nweaknesses that we have on our networks,\n\n97\n00:04:53.932 --> 00:04:57.532\nand in our systems so that we understand\nhow we can start to protect from those.\n\n98\n00:04:58.756 --> 00:05:02.396\nThen we focus on in Applications,\nData and Host Security.\n\n99\n00:05:02.396 --> 00:05:05.896\nNow that we understand Threats and\nVulnerabilities how do we protect, right?\n\n100\n00:05:05.896 --> 00:05:09.146\nWhat can we put in place to protect\nour data, to protect our host,\n\n101\n00:05:09.146 --> 00:05:12.436\nthe actual work stations, the laptops,\nphones, tablets, whatever?\n\n102\n00:05:12.436 --> 00:05:13.106\nHow do we protect them?\n\n103\n00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.240\nThen we get into access control and\nidentify management in domain five,\n\n104\n00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.800\nand this is where we talk about\nphysical access into a building,\n\n105\n00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.710\nhow do you get through a door, how do we\nidentify people are who they say they are.\n\n106\n00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.130\nAnd not just physical security but\nlogical also.\n\n107\n00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.300\nIf somebody's logging into an email\nserver, how do you know that it's actually\n\n108\n00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.630\nthem and\nnot just somebody that stole the password?\n\n109\n00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.000\nSo how do we handle identity management?\n\n110\n00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.680\nAnd then in the last domain\nwe have cryptography.\n\n111\n00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.920\nEncryption is a key component in\nsecuring a network, whether it be\n\n112\n00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.030\nemail encryption or website encryption or\ngeneralized encryption like IPSec.\n\n113\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.930\nThose are all key things that\nwe need to be familiar with\n\n114\n00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.040\nto know what options we have.\n\n115\n00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.520\nRight, if I say, I need to send a secure\nemail, okay, well, what choices do I have?\n\n116\n00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.760\nHow can I do that?\n\n117\n00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.430\nI need to understand what\noptions are available to me,\n\n118\n00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.460\nand that's what the cryptography\nsection is all about.\n\n119\n00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.920\nAll right, because there's good\nencryption and there's bad encryption.\n\n120\n00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.750\nNot all encryption is created equal,\nso we need to know the difference.\n\n121\n00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.040\nAll right, well,\nthat's what's on the exam.\n\n122\n00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.200\nThose are the general topics\nthat are gonna be covered.\n\n123\n00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.610\nWhat about the exam itself?\n\n124\n00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.460\nWell, this is another nice one because\nit's one exam, one certification.\n\n125\n00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.670\nSo you take a single exam, you pass it,\nand you're now Security+ certified.\n\n126\n00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.730\nThe exam itself I've got\nthe details pulled up here.\n\n127\n00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.010\nIt's a maximum of 90 questions.\n\n128\n00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.420\nNotice how they don't tell you\nexactly how many questions.\n\n129\n00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.860\nThat's because the bulk of\nthe exam is multiple choice, but\n\n130\n00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.460\nthen there are practical, what they call\nperformance-based questions on there\n\n131\n00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.920\nwhere they might give you the command\nprompt for a Windows machine.\n\n132\n00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.440\nOr they might give you the web interface\nfor a router and you have to go in and\n\n133\n00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.350\napply security settings to it to\nproperly implement a secure device,\n\n134\n00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.640\nmaybe secure a wireless network.\n\n135\n00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.100\nYou've gotta punch in\nsome wireless settings.\n\n136\n00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.200\nSo those are hands on type of activities.\n\n137\n00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.260\nWhen you have those, it reduces the total\nnumber of questions on the exam.\n\n138\n00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.030\nSo 90 is the maximum,\nyou'll likely have less.\n\n139\n00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.390\nYou get 90 minutes to take the exam\nwhich is not a ton of time.\n\n140\n00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.300\nRight, so you need to spend less\nthan one minute per question\n\n141\n00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.590\notherwise you're gonna run\nout of time on the exam.\n\n142\n00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.050\nAnd you need to score a 750 or\nhigher out of a 900 points scale.\n\n143\n00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.560\nSo you don't have to be perfect, you can\nget some wrong and you'll still pass\n\n144\n00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.790\nthe exam, it is a challenging exam so\nthey do allow some leeway there, right?\n\n145\n00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.030\nNow the exam itself is $311 US you can\npull up foreign pricing if you're in\n\n146\n00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.450\nanother country right on CompTIA's\nwebsite or on the Vue website.\n\n147\n00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.536\nNow I mention Vue, who is that?\n\n148\n00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:36.730\nThe exam is proctored through\na company called Pearson Vue.\n\n149\n00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.274\nVue is V-U-E.\n\n150\n00:07:38.274 --> 00:07:42.020\nAnd they have testing\ncenters all over the world.\n\n151\n00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.220\nSo when you're ready to take the exam\nyou just look up the nearest Vue\n\n152\n00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.240\ntesting centers to you.\n\n153\n00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.550\nAnd the way way you can do that\nis by going to the website.\n\n154\n00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.955\nThe website is vue.com.\n\n155\n00:07:50.955 --> 00:07:54.820\nVue.com and when you go there you'll\nsee a link at the top of the site for\n\n156\n00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.140\ntest takers.\n\n157\n00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.149\nAnd when you jump onto the page you can\ntell what kind of exam you are looking to\n\n158\n00:07:59.149 --> 00:08:01.720\ntake cuz they do testing for\na number of different providers.\n\n159\n00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.850\nI'm gonna type in CompTIA, right?\n\n160\n00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.080\nAnd once I'm there,\nI'm on the CompTIA page and from here,\n\n161\n00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:13.150\nI can go down to find a test center and\nlocate the nearest test center to me.\n\n162\n00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:19.080\nSo, let's say that I'm in New York,\nNew York and so,\n\n163\n00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.300\nI'll punch that in and find out how many\ntesting centers, I'm sure there's a ton.\n\n164\n00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.920\nAnd so\nI can see just right here in Manhattan or\n\n165\n00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.220\nwherever we got at least\nfive that are nearby.\n\n166\n00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.390\nAnd so, I can find the nearest testing\ncenter to me, go on to the site,\n\n167\n00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.360\nregister for the exam and\njump over and take that test.\n\n168\n00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.690\nWhen you take the test, it is computer\nbased, so it is immediately graded and\n\n169\n00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.870\nas soon as you complete it, you will\nknow whether you passed or failed,\n\n170\n00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.400\nright there on the screen.\n\n171\n00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.610\nYou get the certification,\nyou put it on your resume and\n\n172\n00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.340\nnow you're ready to jump in and\nstart that IT security career.\n\n173\n00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:48.540\nAll right, so what's next?\n\n174\n00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.650\nWell if this is the certification for\nyou, then it's study time.\n\n175\n00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.940\nYou need to hit the books or videos.\n\n176\n00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.510\nGo to sites like ITPro TV.\n\n177\n00:08:55.510 -->
