          "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n1\n00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.728\n[SOUND] In this video,\n\n2\n00:00:01.728 --> 00:00:07.183\nwe're gonna take a look at\nthe CompTIA Security+ certification.\n\n3\n00:00:07.183 --> 00:00:11.433\nIf you're not familiar with it, the\nSecurity+ certification is an intermediate\n\n4\n00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:15.684\nlevel cert from CompTIA and is designed to\nshow that you have the relevant knowledge\n\n5\n00:00:15.684 --> 00:00:18.760\nand skills to function\nas a IT security worker.\n\n6\n00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.660\nIT security is extremely\nimportant these days.\n\n7\n00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.710\nIt’s a rare that a week goes by that you\ndon't hear about a company being hacked or\n\n8\n00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.140\nhaving their credit card database stolen.\n\n9\n00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.160\nAnd it’s really becoming a big, major\nissue and companies are recognizing that.\n\n10\n00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.260\nAnd so more and\nmore people are becoming IT workers.\n\n11\n00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.750\nIT security workers.\n\n12\n00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.320\nAnd if you wanna work in the security\nfield, where do you get started?\n\n13\n00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.475\nWell, the Security+ certification\nis really the best place for that.\n\n14\n00:00:44.475 --> 00:00:48.376\nSecurity+ is not gonna teach you\nhow to break into a web server and\n\n15\n00:00:48.376 --> 00:00:51.650\nhow to protect the credit card\ndatabase all by yourself.\n\n16\n00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.330\nWhat is gonna teach you are the\nfundamental skills that you need to\n\n17\n00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.285\nunderstand before you're able to move to\nthat level, to the more advanced levels.\n\n18\n00:01:00.285 --> 00:01:03.340\nSecurity+ is really designed for\nalmost everyone.\n\n19\n00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.690\nIt is a hard exam, so you don't\nnecessarily want the male room clerk or\n\n20\n00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.158\nthe cafeteria workers to be able to go and\nget the Security+ certification.\n\n21\n00:01:13.158 --> 00:01:15.900\nBut if you work in IT,\nif you're a systems admin or\n\n22\n00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.060\na network admin somebody like that and\nsecurity falls under your per view,\n\n23\n00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.540\nwell this is something that\nyou really need to know.\n\n24\n00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.520\nBut if you're going to be focused as\na penetration tester, as a IT security\n\n25\n00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.180\nauditor, as a security officer,\nSecurity+ is really a requirement.\n\n26\n00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.860\nThis is foundational knowledge\nthat everyone working in IT\n\n27\n00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.350\nsecurity should have.\n\n28\n00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.220\nLet's take a look at CompTIA's\ncareer road map, right?\n\n29\n00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.710\nCompTIA likes to map all\ncertifications to particular careers.\n\n30\n00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.480\nAnd the very top career field\nis information security,\n\n31\n00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.940\nit's on top for a reason.\n\n32\n00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.140\nIt's on top because there is a lack\nof IT security workers right now.\n\n33\n00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.150\nCompanies are trying to hire\nas many as they can, and\n\n34\n00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.570\nthere just aren't enough\nof them out there.\n\n35\n00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.351\nWell, if you look the beginner and\nnovice level for\n\n36\n00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:02.800\nthat is the IT fundamentals and\nA+ certification that we've seen before.\n\n37\n00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.150\nBut as you move to the intermediate level\nlook at the amount of certifications\n\n38\n00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.170\nthat are available.\n\n39\n00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.680\nThere's Cisco certification.\n\n40\n00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.830\nThere's one's from (ISC)² and\nEC council and other vendors like that.\n\n41\n00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.270\nAnd CompTIA has a number\nof certifications also.\n\n42\n00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.690\nAnd the one that I'm talking\nabout right now is Security+.\n\n43\n00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.850\nNow, you'll also notice that CompTIA CSA+,\nso the Cybersecurity analyst+.\n\n44\n00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.780\nWhy two certifications at the same level?\n\n45\n00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.195\nWell they're actually\na little bit different.\n\n46\n00:02:31.195 --> 00:02:34.650\nSecurity+ is fundamentals, right?\n\n47\n00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.780\nGeneral concepts, theory,\n\n48\n00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.625\nknowledge that everyone should have\nthat's working in IT security.\n\n49\n00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:43.930\nCSA+ is a little more practical,\na little more hands on.\n\n50\n00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.670\nSo actually understanding how\nattacks are pulled off and\n\n51\n00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.840\nhow to protect those servers and\ngoing that extra step.\n\n52\n00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.450\nThat's important also if you're\nthe actual security worker, right?\n\n53\n00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.722\nIf you're a network admin, that knowledge\nisn't necessarily relevant to you,\n\n54\n00:02:57.722 --> 00:02:59.540\nSecurity+ is.\n\n55\n00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.310\nBut if you are a penetration tester or\na security officer\n\n56\n00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.170\nyou wanna do a Security+ and the CSA+,\nboth of them go together really well.\n\n57\n00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.110\nBut Security+ is the starting point.\n\n58\n00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.870\nIt's the intermediate level the one that\nwe kind of kick off with in security.\n\n59\n00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.660\nAnd then we move up to the advanced\nlevel and beyond from there, right?\n\n60\n00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.590\nWell let's talk a little bit about\nwhat's on the certification, right?\n\n61\n00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.120\nCompTIA publishes all of the exam\nobjectors rights on their website.\n\n62\n00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.480\nYou can go to CompTIA.org\nto pull the full list.\n\n63\n00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.340\nThis exact document that\nI'm looking at right here.\n\n64\n00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.880\nAnd what they do is they\ntake all the topics and\n\n65\n00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.980\nthey divide them up into domains.\n\n66\n00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.380\nAnd so I've got the different\ndomains pulled up on my screen here.\n\n67\n00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.830\nSix different domains.\n\n68\n00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.670\nSome are more important than others,\nright?\n\n69\n00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.680\nWhere some of them make up 20% of\nthe exam, others make up just 12%, right?\n\n70\n00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.750\nSo they've geared it based on\nthe importance level of the knowledge\n\n71\n00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.720\nin the career, right?\n\n72\n00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.210\nAnd they start with network security.\n\n73\n00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.580\nIf your network is not secured it doesn't\nmatter how much effort you put behind\n\n74\n00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.410\nsecuring your workstations and servers.\n\n75\n00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.520\nYour network has been compromised.\n\n76\n00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.990\nYour data will be caught in transit.\n\n77\n00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.910\nSo, securing a network is\nwhere they kick it off.\n\n78\n00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.570\nHow do we protect data in motion?\n\n79\n00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.260\nIn domain two, Compliance and\nOperational Security.\n\n80\n00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.790\nThis is really important.\n\n81\n00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.390\nYou might have government\nagencies that have restrictions,\n\n82\n00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.310\nthat have regulations in place\nthat you need to follow.\n\n83\n00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.800\nOr you might just internally have your\nown requirements for any network gear or\n\n84\n00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.980\nservers or workstations that are on\nyour network, you have these rules for\n\n85\n00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.370\nhow they get secured.\n\n86\n00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.620\nWell, a lot of us do a great job\nof securing the devices at first.\n\n87\n00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.150\nBut then they get deployed and\nthey run for\n\n88\n00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.655\nsix months and they start getting less.\n\n89\n00:04:32.655 --> 00:04:35.885\nAnd less secure as people mess with them,\nso how do we make sure that we maintain\n\n90\n00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:38.825\ncompliance, what kind of\nprocesses do we need in place?\n\n91\n00:04:38.825 --> 00:04:41.175\nThat's what covered in domain two.\n\n92\n00:04:41.175 --> 00:04:43.805\nIn domain three we have threats and\nvulnerabilities.\n\n93\n00:04:43.805 --> 00:04:46.082\nIf you're going to\nprotect your environment,\n\n94\n00:04:46.082 --> 00:04:48.502\nyou need to know what\nyou're protecting it from.\n\n95\n00:04:48.502 --> 00:04:50.952\nAnd so we address all the different\nthreats that are out there.\n\n96\n00:04:50.952 --> 00:04:53.932\nSome of the vulnerabilities, the\nweaknesses that we have on our networks,\n\n97\n00:04:53.932 --> 00:04:57.532\nand in our systems so that we understand\nhow we can start to protect from those.\n\n98\n00:04:58.756 --> 00:05:02.396\nThen we focus on in Applications,\nData and Host Security.\n\n99\n00:05:02.396 --> 00:05:05.896\nNow that we understand Threats and\nVulnerabilities how do we protect, right?\n\n100\n00:05:05.896 --> 00:05:09.146\nWhat can we put in place to protect\nour data, to protect our host,\n\n101\n00:05:09.146 --> 00:05:12.436\nthe actual work stations, the laptops,\nphones, tablets, whatever?\n\n102\n00:05:12.436 --> 00:05:13.106\nHow do we protect them?\n\n103\n00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.240\nThen we get into access control and\nidentify management in domain five,\n\n104\n00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.800\nand this is where we talk about\nphysical access into a building,\n\n105\n00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.710\nhow do you get through a door, how do we\nidentify people are who they say they are.\n\n106\n00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.130\nAnd not just physical security but\nlogical also.\n\n107\n00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.300\nIf somebody's logging into an email\nserver, how do you know that it's actually\n\n108\n00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.630\nthem and\nnot just somebody that stole the password?\n\n109\n00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.000\nSo how do we handle identity management?\n\n110\n00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.680\nAnd then in the last domain\nwe have cryptography.\n\n111\n00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.920\nEncryption is a key component in\nsecuring a network, whether it be\n\n112\n00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.030\nemail encryption or website encryption or\ngeneralized encryption like IPSec.\n\n113\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.930\nThose are all key things that\nwe need to be familiar with\n\n114\n00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.040\nto know what options we have.\n\n115\n00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.520\nRight, if I say, I need to send a secure\nemail, okay, well, what choices do I have?\n\n116\n00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.760\nHow can I do that?\n\n117\n00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.430\nI need to understand what\noptions are available to me,\n\n118\n00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.460\nand that's what the cryptography\nsection is all about.\n\n119\n00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.920\nAll right, because there's good\nencryption and there's bad encryption.\n\n120\n00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.750\nNot all encryption is created equal,\nso we need to know the difference.\n\n121\n00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.040\nAll right, well,\nthat's what's on the exam.\n\n122\n00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.200\nThose are the general topics\nthat are gonna be covered.\n\n123\n00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.610\nWhat about the exam itself?\n\n124\n00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.460\nWell, this is another nice one because\nit's one exam, one certification.\n\n125\n00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.670\nSo you take a single exam, you pass it,\nand you're now Security+ certified.\n\n126\n00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.730\nThe exam itself I've got\nthe details pulled up here.\n\n127\n00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.010\nIt's a maximum of 90 questions.\n\n128\n00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.420\nNotice how they don't tell you\nexactly how many questions.\n\n129\n00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.860\nThat's because the bulk of\nthe exam is multiple choice, but\n\n130\n00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.460\nthen there are practical, what they call\nperformance-based questions on there\n\n131\n00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.920\nwhere they might give you the command\nprompt for a Windows machine.\n\n132\n00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.440\nOr they might give you the web interface\nfor a router and you have to go in and\n\n133\n00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.350\napply security settings to it to\nproperly implement a secure device,\n\n134\n00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.640\nmaybe secure a wireless network.\n\n135\n00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.100\nYou've gotta punch in\nsome wireless settings.\n\n136\n00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.200\nSo those are hands on type of activities.\n\n137\n00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.260\nWhen you have those, it reduces the total\nnumber of questions on the exam.\n\n138\n00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.030\nSo 90 is the maximum,\nyou'll likely have less.\n\n139\n00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.390\nYou get 90 minutes to take the exam\nwhich is not a ton of time.\n\n140\n00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.300\nRight, so you need to spend less\nthan one minute per question\n\n141\n00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.590\notherwise you're gonna run\nout of time on the exam.\n\n142\n00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.050\nAnd you need to score a 750 or\nhigher out of a 900 points scale.\n\n143\n00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.560\nSo you don't have to be perfect, you can\nget some wrong and you'll still pass\n\n144\n00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.790\nthe exam, it is a challenging exam so\nthey do allow some leeway there, right?\n\n145\n00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.030\nNow the exam itself is $311 US you can\npull up foreign pricing if you're in\n\n146\n00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.450\nanother country right on CompTIA's\nwebsite or on the Vue website.\n\n147\n00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.536\nNow I mention Vue, who is that?\n\n148\n00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:36.730\nThe exam is proctored through\na company called Pearson Vue.\n\n149\n00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.274\nVue is V-U-E.\n\n150\n00:07:38.274 --> 00:07:42.020\nAnd they have testing\ncenters all over the world.\n\n151\n00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.220\nSo when you're ready to take the exam\nyou just look up the nearest Vue\n\n152\n00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.240\ntesting centers to you.\n\n153\n00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.550\nAnd the way way you can do that\nis by going to the website.\n\n154\n00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.955\nThe website is vue.com.\n\n155\n00:07:50.955 --> 00:07:54.820\nVue.com and when you go there you'll\nsee a link at the top of the site for\n\n156\n00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.140\ntest takers.\n\n157\n00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.149\nAnd when you jump onto the page you can\ntell what kind of exam you are looking to\n\n158\n00:07:59.149 --> 00:08:01.720\ntake cuz they do testing for\na number of different providers.\n\n159\n00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.850\nI'm gonna type in CompTIA, right?\n\n160\n00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.080\nAnd once I'm there,\nI'm on the CompTIA page and from here,\n\n161\n00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:13.150\nI can go down to find a test center and\nlocate the nearest test center to me.\n\n162\n00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:19.080\nSo, let's say that I'm in New York,\nNew York and so,\n\n163\n00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.300\nI'll punch that in and find out how many\ntesting centers, I'm sure there's a ton.\n\n164\n00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.920\nAnd so\nI can see just right here in Manhattan or\n\n165\n00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.220\nwherever we got at least\nfive that are nearby.\n\n166\n00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.390\nAnd so, I can find the nearest testing\ncenter to me, go on to the site,\n\n167\n00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.360\nregister for the exam and\njump over and take that test.\n\n168\n00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.690\nWhen you take the test, it is computer\nbased, so it is immediately graded and\n\n169\n00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:39.870\nas soon as you complete it, you will\nknow whether you passed or failed,\n\n170\n00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.400\nright there on the screen.\n\n171\n00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.610\nYou get the certification,\nyou put it on your resume and\n\n172\n00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.340\nnow you're ready to jump in and\nstart that IT security career.\n\n173\n00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:48.540\nAll right, so what's next?\n\n174\n00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.650\nWell if this is the certification for\nyou, then it's study time.\n\n175\n00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.940\nYou need to hit the books or videos.\n\n176\n00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.510\nGo to sites like ITPro TV.\n\n177\n00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:56.820\nYou can watch our video content.\n\n178\n00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.860\nWe've produced videos for\nall the exam objectives for\n\n179\n00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.080\nthe CompTIA Security+ certification.\n\n180\n00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.012\nYou can watch those study up and\n\n181\n00:09:04.012 --> 00:09:07.610\ngo and take that exam or whatever other\nvendors you choose to use as many great\n\n182\n00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:11.270\nbooks that are out there by companies\nlike [INAUDIBLE] and Sidebacks.\n\n183\n00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.480\nThey cover a lot of the content and\nthose are great providers too.\n\n184\n00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.490\nCompTIA also has resources on their page.\n\n185\n00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.800\nIf you go to CompTIA.org You can find\na lot of great study resources there.\n\n186\n00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.520\nTake the exam and\nyou get the certification.\n\n187\n00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.850\nWhere do you go after that?\n\n188\n00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:28.020\nWell the next step is really the CSA+,\nthe cyber security analyst,\n\n189\n00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.050\nthat's where you really start getting\na little more hands on with things.\n\n190\n00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.310\nBut there's other certifications\nout there also like EC counsel,\n\n191\n00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.050\ncertified ethical hacker.\n\n192\n00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:39.190\nThere's the certified\nforensics investigator.\n\n193\n00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:43.890\nThere's a number of other certification\nfor other vendors like, not Microsoft, but\n\n194\n00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.580\nCisco where they have their firewall\ncertifications, or Juniper,\n\n195\n00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.890\nwith their SSG's.\n\n196\n00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.860\nThose are great certifications\nto move into also.\n\n197\n00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.290\nAll is part of that security career.\n\n198\n00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.270\nSecurity is a hot button today.\n\n199\n00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.855\nSo a lot of companies are looking for\ncertified professionals.\n\n200\n00:09:57.855 --> 00:10:00.010\nSecurity+ is the starting point.\n\n201\n00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.090\nAll the other certifications\nare about evolving your career and\n\n202\n00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:07.150\nincreasing your knowledge but\nSecurity+ is where we start.\n\n203\n00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.620\nAll right.\nWell, hopefully that's a good overview for\n\n204\n00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:09.450\nyou on Security+.\n\n205\n00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.800\nWe've seen what's on the exam and\nwho it's tailored for.\n\n206\n00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.870\nIf you're studying for it,\n\n207\n00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.375\nbest of luck in your studies and\nwe hope to see you online.\n\n208\n00:10:15.375 --> 00:10:18.714\n[SOUND]\n\n",

morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:35,756 --> 00:00:37,356\nWe are here at IT Pro TV,\n\n6\n00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:41,620\nto welcome you to another\nexciting series in security plus.\n\n7\n00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,740\nMy name is Ronnie Wong and\nI am here with Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,860\n>> How's everybody doing?\n\n9\n00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,570\n>> How are you doing today?\n\n10\n00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,830\n>> I am good, how are you doing Ronnie?\n\n11\n00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:49,470\n>> I'm doing fine.\n\n12\n00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,100\n>> I'm psyched man.\n\n13\n00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,090\nWe're getting started on\nthe new security plus stuff.\n\n14\n00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:54,050\n>> We are.\n>> We got the brand new objectives out and\n\n15\n00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,410\nit's gonna be a lot of fun.\n\n16\n00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,930\n>> For us,\nwe're actually updating the series here.\n\n17\n00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,276\nIf you already see on our website,\nas you go through,\n\n18\n00:01:01,276 --> 00:01:03,370\nthere's actually already the SY0301.\n\n19\n00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,330\nWe're now reshooting this because\nthese exams have been updated, and\n\n20\n00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,380\nwe wanna make sure that we get the new\nseries in front of you as well.\n\n21\n00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,840\nAgain, we're not getting\nrid of the old series.\n\n22\n00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,000\nWe just want to make sure that you\nactually have the newer series here,\n\n23\n00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,745\nupdated and\nthe way that we actually want them to go.\n\n24\n00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,195\nAnd so that is what we're actually\ngetting started into today as well.\n\n25\n00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:23,580\n>> Right.\n>> So, we're going to go ahead and\n\n26\n00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,680\njust get right into our episode here as we\n\n27\n00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,040\ntake a look at all of\nthe different things that we have.\n\n28\n00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,984\nAnd we're going to start off here in the\nfirst objective series which is actually\n\n29\n00:01:32,984 --> 00:01:34,560\nunderneath network security.\n\n30\n00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,704\nNow we're not going to take these in\nthe order that they actually show up in\n\n31\n00:01:37,704 --> 00:01:38,270\nright away.\n\n32\n00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:42,020\nWe're going to scroll down\na little bit here, at least I am,\n\n33\n00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,100\nto the network design elements and\ncomponents here.\n\n34\n00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,580\nFor me, I thought that this is\nactually what should come first.\n\n35\n00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,640\nUnderstanding what it is that we\nare actually going to be securing.\n\n36\n00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,840\nSo we're going to take a look at\nsome of the different components\n\n37\n00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,895\nthat we want to make sure that we\nimplement the idea of security, again.\n\n38\n00:01:58,895 --> 00:02:02,550\nWe also want to talk about\nthe idea of implementing security\n\n39\n00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,675\nas a part of the network design.\n\n40\n00:02:04,675 --> 00:02:07,290\nOkay?\nA lot of times in security, right Mike?\n\n41\n00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,970\nThat when we first get started we just\nthink about taking a look at one thing.\n\n42\n00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,790\nAnd that one thing and we secure it.\n\n43\n00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,380\nAnd then later on somebody\nlike Mike comes along and\n\n44\n00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,705\nsays well Ronnie,\nwhy didn't you think about doing this?\n\n45\n00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:20,590\n>> Right.\n\n46\n00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,310\n>> Oh, yeah, I should've thought about\nthat, and then I have to add that in, and\n\n47\n00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,169\nit continues to be what?\n\n48\n00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:26,020\nA domino effect, doesn't it, Mike?\n\n49\n00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,810\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n50\n00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,940\nIt's a very important concept.\n\n51\n00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,970\nWhen we're talking about security\nwe always talk about things like\n\n52\n00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,290\ndefense in depth or layers of security.\n\n53\n00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,140\nAnd that just means looking at\nevery aspect of your network and\n\n54\n00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,180\nimplementing security.\n\n55\n00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,440\nWe're gonna talk about\nthe different layers and\n\n56\n00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,275\nwhere we want to look at security.\n\n57\n00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:43,970\nBut it's like if you just like,\nway back in the day,\n\n58\n00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,566\nthey used to put firewalls\nat the edge of the network.\n\n59\n00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,030\nRight?\nAnd they thought okay, that's it,\n\n60\n00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,700\nI'm safe because that kept bad guys from\ngetting into your network or attempted to.\n\n61\n00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,870\nBut if somebody did finally make it\nthrough that firewall, then they have\n\n62\n00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,160\nfree rein inside your network and\nthere was not much you could do.\n\n63\n00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,455\nAnd so it's really important that we\nunderstand that we want to apply layers of\n\n64\n00:03:01,455 --> 00:03:04,795\ndefense at every layer, because that's\ngonna help us in a couple of ways.\n\n65\n00:03:04,795 --> 00:03:07,640\nRight?\nWe're going to one, the bad guy might be\n\n66\n00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,540\nskilled at, let's say he's really good\nat breaking through firewalls and\n\n67\n00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,510\ndoing firewalking and things like that.\n\n68\n00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,330\nThat's great.\n\n69\n00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,220\nBut when he gets through there all of\na sudden boom he hits your subnets\n\n70\n00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,600\nthat he doesn't know how to get around or\nsomething like that.\n\n71\n00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,670\nSo maybe you slow him down by\ndoing layers of defense because\n\n72\n00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,590\nhe can't get through\neach one of those layers.\n\n73\n00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,065\nAlso, it gives us more\ntime to detect the attack.\n\n74\n00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:29,100\nRight?\nHopefully at some point he's gonna set off\n\n75\n00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,730\nan alarm as he's going through\nthe firewall, as he's going through\n\n76\n00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,560\nthe different subnets when he's\ntrying to access that host.\n\n77\n00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,210\n>> Yeah.\n\n78\n00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,310\nSo I went ahead and made a drawing to\nactually try to illustrate what it is that\n\n79\n00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,860\nMike was actually talking about\nhere to kind of help us out.\n\n80\n00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,930\nSo over on the left-hand side, this is\nhow I began in understanding security.\n\n81\n00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,460\nSo I would take a look at my data.\n\n82\n00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,990\nAnd that would be all I would\nfocus in on in terms of securing.\n\n83\n00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,730\n>> Right.\n>> But then,\n\n84\n00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,430\nonce I actually had that secured,\n\n85\n00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,940\nI didn't think about elements\nlike the entire network itself.\n\n86\n00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,700\nOr the applications that would\naccess that particular data.\n\n87\n00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,450\n>> Right.\n>> And so\n\n88\n00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,240\nif I don't think about that, right?\n\n89\n00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,820\nWhat ends up happening here is that they\nmay not attack the data itself right away.\n\n90\n00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,075\nThey may think about getting\naccess to the application or\n\n91\n00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:11,485\nthat individual computer,\nor the rest of the network.\n\n92\n00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:12,550\n>> Right.\n>> The only thing that I'm\n\n93\n00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,790\nworried about here is, is I go look, I\nhave a firewall on the edge of my network.\n\n94\n00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,490\nAt the very perimeter of my network and\nthat should be enough.\n\n95\n00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:25,100\nBut what if then, if an attack does\ncome in from the outside, okay?\n\n96\n00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,150\nInbound here.\n\n97\n00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:28,910\nThis is now,\nlet me see if I can make that here.\n\n98\n00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,570\nOkay, a little bit larger for us.\n\n99\n00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,020\nI hate all those little lines.\n\n100\n00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm trying to get away from that, but\n\n101\n00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,968\nit's not letting there either.\n\n102\n00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:37,240\nSo if they,\nonce they get past that perimeter, okay,\n\n103\n00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,740\nthis is what Mike was talking about.\n\n104\n00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,160\nThey, again,\ndon't have to attack the data, itself.\n\n105\n00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,990\nBut notice that they can\nget access to network.\n\n106\n00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,580\n>> Right.\n>> Which may lead to, again,\n\n107\n00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,570\na host computer.\n\n108\n00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,400\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or an application.\n\n109\n00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,810\nAnd then, into the data, itself.\n\n110\n00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,560\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n111\n00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,400\nYou know,\napplications have vulnerabilities.\n\n112\n00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,620\nAnd so,\nif I get through his perimeter network,\n\n113\n00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,530\nright there maybe his data is secure.\n\n114\n00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,880\nMaybe he's got it protected really well,\nbut he didn't think about the application.\n\n115\n00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,530\nAnd I know that that particular\napplication has a vulnerability and\n\n116\n00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,470\nif I can break the application, the\napplication's allowed to get to the data.\n\n117\n00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,130\nRight?\n\n118\n00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,464\nAnd so if I can break the application,\n\n119\n00:05:09,555 --> 00:05:12,495\nmaybe through the application\nI can get access to that data.\n\n120\n00:05:12,495 --> 00:05:16,685\nSo, and that's why we say, you've got\nto apply this at all different levels.\n\n121\n00:05:16,685 --> 00:05:21,295\n>> So what Mike is actually advocating,\nand what every security professional\n\n122\n00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:24,490\nadvocates is what we'd call\nthe idea of Defense in Depth.\n\n123\n00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,880\nRight Mike?\nAnd so the very fact is here,\n\n124\n00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,510\nwhat I actually drew is layers of defense.\n\n125\n00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:34,076\nThat what should happen right Mike, is\nif they are able to penetrate that first\n\n126\n00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:37,138\nlayer, they still have to\ndeal with a second layer.\n\n127\n00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:40,560\n>> I think that's a perfect drawing\nbecause it really illustrates well how\n\n128\n00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,140\nthose layers are going to try to keep\nthem from getting further and further in.\n\n129\n00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,530\nI think it's the perfect\nway to look at it.\n\n130\n00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,080\n>> Yeah.\n\n131\n00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,520\nAnd what we're really hoping for right?\n\n132\n00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,560\nI describe it this way to people that ask,\nwhat is this defense in depth?\n\n133\n00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,952\n>> Right.\n>> I'd say it's the ability to bore\n\n134\n00:05:53,952 --> 00:05:55,332\nan attacker to death.\n\n135\n00:05:55,332 --> 00:05:58,460\n>> [LAUGH] Absolutely.\n\n136\n00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,590\n>> They want my data.\n\n137\n00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,630\nI want to put so\n\n138\n00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,400\nmany different things in their path\n>> Right.\n\n139\n00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,830\n>> That they're like,\nI don't really feel like doing it.\n\n140\n00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,085\nIt's like when I need to clean\nout my garage on the weekends.\n\n141\n00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:08,495\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I open the door and\n\n142\n00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:10,349\ngo yep, let's close that back up.\n\n143\n00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:11,240\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nWhat it shows in the outside.\n\n144\n00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,330\n>> So that's how I always look at\nthe idea of Defense in Depth here,\n\n145\n00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,320\nis that we're providing layer upon layer\nof security for everything in our network.\n\n146\n00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,815\nWe can't think about just one thing.\n\n147\n00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:22,230\n>> Right.\n>> We need to think about it\n\n148\n00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,850\nfrom the overall idea that we\nhave to provided these layers.\n\n149\n00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,950\nNow that comes down to the idea\nof thinking about security\n\n150\n00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,400\nwhen we're designing the network best.\n\n151\n00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,050\nWhat do we really want to\ninclude in our network?\n\n152\n00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,400\nSo, even though I might think about\nthe idea, hey, I've got my host machine or\n\n153\n00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,500\nmy work station.\n\n154\n00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,610\nI may have to think about,\nwhat are the elements I need to involve\n\n155\n00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,200\ninto my network if I'm gonna be\nrunning a production network?\n\n156\n00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,630\nSometimes you start too small.\n\n157\n00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:48,200\nSometimes you think about the idea,\nwell, this is all I need in my network.\n\n158\n00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,220\nAnd then you start having to add that in.\n\n159\n00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,500\nA new component, go network\nwasn't really designed for that.\n\n160\n00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,120\nWell what do I need to do to get it ready?\n\n161\n00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,940\nAnd they tell you, and you go no, no, no.\n\n162\n00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,740\nThat's just too much.\n\n163\n00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,330\nWhat can I do just now to secure that one?\n\n164\n00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,230\nSo we wanna make sure that we understand\nthat when we start off here in terms of\n\n165\n00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,100\nnetwork security,\nit's from that design element but\n\n166\n00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,490\nthis is what we want to implement.\n\n167\n00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,110\n>> Right.\n\n168\n00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,000\nYeah, you really do.\nYou have to plan.\n\n169\n00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,750\nAnd we're not, unfortunately we're not,\nwhat's a good way to say it?\n\n170\n00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,770\nSometimes we're not there in\nthe beginning of the network, right?\n\n171\n00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,350\n>> Yeah, that's true.\n\n172\n00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,350\n>> And it is,\nit's more difficult to go back and\n\n173\n00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,965\nsecure something that's already set up.\n\n174\n00:07:19,965 --> 00:07:25,170\nIt's a lot easier if in your initial\ndesign, security was a concern.\n\n175\n00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,590\nAnd years ago, that wasn't the case.\n\n176\n00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,640\nAnd I think nowadays it is, but it's much\nbetter if you can start from the beginning\n\n177\n00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,930\nand lay it all out and try to see where\nyou might run into a stumbling block.\n\n178\n00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,550\nAnd we've done some of the project\nmanagement episodes, I think.\n\n179\n00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,620\n>> Right.\n>> And some things like that.\n\n180\n00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,620\nAnd it does take some planning and\nlooking at all the pieces and\n\n181\n00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,632\ngetting a lot of people together that have\ndifferent experience in different areas,\n\n182\n00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:51,320\nand cuz what I might not think about some\nof the things that Ronnie might need when\n\n183\n00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,860\nhe sets up that terminal server, because\nI'm not as familiar with terminal server.\n\n184\n00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,724\nSo you get people from the different areas\nto design all these different layers and\n\n185\n00:07:57,724 --> 00:07:58,625\nput them in place.\n\n186\n00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,749\n>> Yeah, so we wanna make sure that we\ntalk about the idea of these different\n\n187\n00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:04,792\ncomponents that we're gonna include\ninto the design of our network.\n\n188\n00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,422\nand the reason why we want to do it,\n\n189\n00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:09,810\nis because we need to plan out what we\nexpect our network to be able to do.\n\n190\n00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,460\nNot just what it's doing right now, but\n\n191\n00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,350\nwhat we expect our network to be able\nto do and what types of things we\n\n192\n00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:19,200\nmight want to include and have security\nas a part of that initial design not as\n\n193\n00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,850\nan addition to it on top of it, is what\nwe're going to take a look at here.\n\n194\n00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,810\nSo when we take a look at\nthe objectives again on 1.3,\n\n195\n00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,160\nwe're gonna just briefly\ndescribe the idea of using DMZs.\n\n196\n00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,970\nWe're gonna take a look at subnetting and\nVLANs.\n\n197\n00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,330\nWe're going to talk about\nthe implementation of NAT and\n\n198\n00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,570\nwhy this is important,\nremote access, telephony, and so\n\n199\n00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,915\nwe're going to take a look a little\nbit of time in describing this.\n\n200\n00:08:42,915 --> 00:08:47,175\nAnd of course today, our favorite topic\nhere, of course, is the very fact that\n\n201\n00:08:47,175 --> 00:08:50,515\nnetworks are no longer just bound\ninside of my own physical area.\n\n202\n00:08:50,515 --> 00:08:55,087\nThe very fact that we have things that are\nlocated elsewhere into the cloud services,\n\n203\n00:08:55,087 --> 00:08:59,007\nwe might also want to think about\nthe idea of security with that too.\n\n204\n00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:00,587\nSo having a layered approach,\n\n205\n00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:04,117\nthinking about that from the design point\nis where we're going to actually begin.\n\n206\n00:09:04,117 --> 00:09:07,818\nSo I like taking the approach here and\nand Mike,\n\n207\n00:09:07,818 --> 00:09:09,568\nif you wanna change this to you,\nlet me know here.\n\n208\n00:09:09,568 --> 00:09:13,728\nBut let's talk about it from the outside\nin, in terms of just basic components.\n\n209\n00:09:13,728 --> 00:09:14,948\n>> Makes sense to me.\n\n210\n00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:17,668\n>> So let's start off with this\nidea of protecting ourselves\n\n211\n00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:20,900\nright at the perimeter\nhere in terms of design.\n\n212\n00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,860\nSo, if we were to do this okay?\n\n213\n00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,846\nAnd I were to think about the idea of\nprotecting my network from the outside\n\n214\n00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:29,944\ncoming in, the devices that\nwe might think about using.\n\n215\n00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,581\n>> Right.\n>> Might be, what, a router,\n\n216\n00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:34,343\npossibly a firewall.\n\n217\n00:09:34,343 --> 00:09:35,192\n>> Yeah.\n\n218\n00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:36,218\nAbsolutely.\n\n219\n00:09:36,218 --> 00:09:37,296\n>> So, when we start thinking about it,\n\n220\n00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:38,654\nit's not just the idea of\nnow I have a firewall.\n\n221\n00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:39,878\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Well what the heck\n\n222\n00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:41,446\ndo I do with a firewall?\n\n223\n00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:42,630\n>> Right.\n>> Okay?\n\n224\n00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,785\nSo a lot of times it depends on what,\nwhat do we need to do, okay?\n\n225\n00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,970\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> One of the things that we can set up is\n\n226\n00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,865\nwhat we call the idea on the use of a DMZ,\nokay?\n\n227\n00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:51,446\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Is what we\n\n228\n00:09:51,446 --> 00:09:52,037\nmight actually think about doing.\n\n229\n00:09:52,037 --> 00:09:56,460\nSo let's go ahead and talk about this\nnature of the idea of the DMZ as well.\n\n230\n00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,592\n>> Good old DMZ.\n\n231\n00:09:57,592 --> 00:09:58,212\nDMZ or demilitarized zone.\n\n232\n00:09:58,212 --> 00:09:58,880\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n233\n00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,590\n>> Or, you know, you'll hear people call\nit a screen subnet or a perimeter network.\n\n234\n00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,400\nTypically, if you're a company\nthat has resources, you know,\n\n235\n00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,440\nwhen we look at our resources,\na lot of my resources is internal, right.\n\n236\n00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,690\nOnly the users within my network\nreally need access to that data.\n\n237\n00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,720\nBut most organizations do have\nsomething that the public\n\n238\n00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,580\nneeds to be able to access,\nlike a website.\n\n239\n00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,960\nIf we're going to sell product or\nsomething.\n\n240\n00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,850\nIt could be remote access servers\nthat you're users need to\n\n241\n00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,950\nhit when they're out of the hotel or\nat home, or something like that.\n\n242\n00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,280\nThe front end of maybe a mailbox service,\nthey can check their mail.\n\n243\n00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,720\nSo some of these resources need\nto be exposed to the outside, but\n\n244\n00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,420\nI don't want to expose my\nentire network to the outside.\n\n245\n00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,960\nI don't want my entire domain controllers\nbeing visible from the outside.\n\n246\n00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:47,070\nMy DNS, my internal DNS server should\nnot be accessible from the outside.\n\n247\n00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,970\nMy everyday clients,\nthe workstations that my users sit at,\n\n248\n00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,720\nthose should not be directly\naccessible from the outside.\n\n249\n00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,630\nSo, the DMZ this is a secure,\nit's a portion of my network\n\n250\n00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,460\nthat doesn't follow the same security\nrules as my internal network.\n\n251\n00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,060\nMy internal network, heavily protected.\n\n252\n00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,040\nThe DMZ, maybe a little looser\non the firewall rules to allow\n\n253\n00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,320\nsome of that anonymous access or\nfrom the outside.\n\n254\n00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:09,910\n>> Yeah.\n\n255\n00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,110\nSo, if I'm thinking about\nsetting something up like this.\n\n256\n00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:15,750\nWhere I am having a website which I\nwant the public to be available through.\n\n257\n00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,870\nA DMZ is a great thing that I might want\nto go ahead and implement and think about.\n\n258\n00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,540\nSo I drew this, I say I drew it,\nI use a design program here.\n\n259\n00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,400\nA diagram program.\n\n260\n00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,070\n>> You're an artiste.\n\n261\n00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,020\n>> I wish I could say I was\nactually this artistic.\n\n262\n00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,200\n>> Colored chalk and everything.\n\n263\n00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,630\n>> Yeah, but\nwhat we're actually talking about and\n\n264\n00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,970\nwhat Mike is actually helping\nus to demonstrate here.\n\n265\n00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,650\nIf I can actually use these tools\neffectively, is pretty much the key.\n\n266\n00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:41,702\nIs that what we want, of course,\nis the ability to be able to\n\n267\n00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:47,362\nactually have outside users go here and\nI wish it gave me the ability\n\n268\n00:11:47,362 --> 00:11:53,153\nto change the thickness of this\ntool very easily, but it doesn't.\n\n269\n00:11:53,153 --> 00:11:55,486\nWe want them to be able to\nactually get access here.\n\n270\n00:11:55,486 --> 00:11:58,815\nMaybe.\n\n271\n00:11:58,815 --> 00:11:59,493\nOkay?\n\n272\n00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:02,645\nBut we really do not want them, though,\n\n273\n00:12:02,645 --> 00:12:07,940\nto be able to take that same idea and\nto be able to get through here.\n\n274\n00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,600\nSo, here we really don't\nwant them to gain access to.\n\n275\n00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,230\nIf my webserver was\nalready inside of the LAN,\n\n276\n00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:21,100\nthat's where I'd have problems,\nbecause once they get inside the LAN.\n\n277\n00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,190\n>> Exactly, because you have to\ngive them to the web server,\n\n278\n00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,640\nyou want them to buy your product or\nwhatever the case may be but\n\n279\n00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,786\nthat web server if it's inside your LAN\nnow, any vulnerability that that web\n\n280\n00:12:29,786 --> 00:12:33,110\nserver might have they could\npotentially expose that and\n\n281\n00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,540\ntake advantage of that vulnerability,\nand they're already inside your network.\n\n282\n00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,490\nSo all your defenses that you\nput at the perimeter were for\n\n283\n00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,890\nnot because you let them\nthrough into your web server.\n\n284\n00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,773\nAnd then from there, they've launched\nattacks against other machines or\n\n285\n00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:45,880\ncompromised that machine.\n\n286\n00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,362\nThat's why we don't want to put\nin inside our local area net.\n\n287\n00:12:49,362 --> 00:12:50,471\nWe don't want to put it back there.\n\n288\n00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:54,740\nNow what you've got drawn up\nRonnie is a very typical layout.\n\n289\n00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,710\nSometimes I like to think\nof it even though it's not\n\n290\n00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,920\nphysically laid out that way is\nhaving two separate firewalls.\n\n291\n00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,020\nThen that way visually you can kinda\nget an idea that okay, I've got this\n\n292\n00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,730\nfront firewall that's facing the Internet,\nand it's got some ports open.\n\n293\n00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,660\nAnd it's going to allow certain traffic\nto come in anonymously for example.\n\n294\n00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,360\nAnd then that back firewall is much\nmore secure, much more stringent.\n\n295\n00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,430\nIt only allows the servers from\nmy DMZ to come back inside and\n\n296\n00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,330\nthe web server can come back through the\nback firewall and hit that sequel database\n\n297\n00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,200\nto supply the images for\nmy website, or something like that.\n\n298\n00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,400\nBut other traffic is not allowed,\nit gets dropped at that second firewall.\n\n299\n00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,790\nSo, what Ronnie had up there\nis typically how it's done,\n\n300\n00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,990\nphysically implemented because one\nof the ports on your firewall or\n\n301\n00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,320\nyour router is gonna be\nconsidered your DMZ.\n\n302\n00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,820\nLogically, I like to\nthink of it that way just\n\n303\n00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,470\nseems to make it sink in\nmaybe a little better.\n\n304\n00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,570\n>> Yeah, that would work.\n\n305\n00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,080\nLet me go ahead and\ndraw it the way that Mike has it here.\n\n306\n00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,631\n>> Yeah,\nI goofed up his famous drawing there.\n\n307\n00:13:53,631 --> 00:13:54,894\nI was like yeah, let's do this.\n\n308\n00:13:54,894 --> 00:13:55,797\n>> That's fine.\n\n309\n00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:57,510\nThat's fine.\n>> But yeah, absolutely.\n\n310\n00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,300\nBut some concept.\n\n311\n00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,070\nIt's the exact same thing.\n\n312\n00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:04,800\nIt's just, you're the Cisco guy, so on\nthe router what you were doing, is one of\n\n313\n00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,180\nthose ports is feeding off into a switch\nand then that's considered your DMZ.\n\n314\n00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,840\n>> So\nremember that this is part of the design,\n\n315\n00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,780\nright, we're not wanting to\nactually do this later on.\n\n316\n00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,380\nWe can, don't get me wrong,\nbut if we consider this\n\n317\n00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,290\npart of the overall design element, okay,\nit actually makes it a lot easier for\n\n318\n00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,670\nus to plan for what we need now\nif we wanted to implement it.\n\n319\n00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:26,850\nSo at this point,\nif we hadn't already done this, okay,\n\n320\n00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,950\nI'm just going run\nthe web server in my LAN.\n\n321\n00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,080\nNo, that's the silliest\nthing in the world, and\n\n322\n00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,830\nthen, after now I'm actually\ngot everything set up.\n\n323\n00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,085\nMike says, oh no, what you need\nis you need another firewall.\n\n324\n00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,795\nWell, now I'm gonna be a little bit more\nupset when I know that I'm setting up\n\n325\n00:14:40,795 --> 00:14:44,415\nthe network and I'm not only paying for\none firewall, Mike said no, you need two.\n\n326\n00:14:44,415 --> 00:14:48,565\nIn the design part, and they don't cost\nany money for Mike to actually say no,\n\n327\n00:14:48,565 --> 00:14:53,135\nI need six, I can go no,\nI think two is enough in what I need.\n\n328\n00:14:53,135 --> 00:14:56,795\nBut putting it down as a design helps us\nto keep in mind that security is a big\n\n329\n00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:57,444\npart of our network.\n\n330\n00:14:57,444 --> 00:14:59,430\nIt's from the design, and\n\n331\n00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:03,580\nthat's pretty much what we want to make\nsure that we implement here when we do so.\n\n332\n00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,480\nSo this dual layer firewall\napproach does really help us out in\n\n333\n00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,229\nterms of understanding why we\nmay want to implement this.\n\n334\n00:15:09,229 --> 00:15:13,245\nNow for our LAN because it's totally\nprotected here, it actually means now even\n\n335\n00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,964\nfrom the outside, right, that the very\nfact is people are not going to have\n\n336\n00:15:16,964 --> 00:15:19,942\nto get access to my protected network,\nonly my web server.\n\n337\n00:15:19,942 --> 00:15:23,517\nWhere I do want them to gain access to\nthey're gonna be able to access too, and\n\n338\n00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:25,116\nthat's really what we want here.\n\n339\n00:15:25,116 --> 00:15:28,267\nWe have resources that we need\nthe public to get access to, but\n\n340\n00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:30,940\nwe don't need to give them\naccess to everything.\n\n341\n00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,450\n>> No.\n>> So\n\n342\n00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:36,870\nthat's where we might take the idea and\nthe time to think about using a DMZ here.\n\n343\n00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,763\nSo, are there any other types of servers\nwe're not putting in the DNC besides\n\n344\n00:15:39,763 --> 00:15:40,395\nthe web server?\n\n345\n00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:41,696\n>> Like my remote access servers.\n\n346\n00:15:41,696 --> 00:15:43,165\n>> There you go, yeah.\n>> A good place to put those guys\n\n347\n00:15:43,165 --> 00:15:45,215\ncuz you know those have to be\nhit from the outside, right?\n\n348\n00:15:45,215 --> 00:15:48,973\nSo you're going to allow that traffic to\ncome in and then from that point they\n\n349\n00:15:48,973 --> 00:15:52,980\nget authenticated before they're allowed\nto back through that rear firewall.\n\n350\n00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,125\nWhat else?\nThe front end of your Exchange server.\n\n351\n00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:59,125\nYou might have a mailbox\nserver that sits out there.\n\n352\n00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:03,069\nMost likely you'll have a DNS server\nWe'll talk a little bit about,\n\n353\n00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:06,000\nI know we go over it in some\nof our Windows episodes.\n\n354\n00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,674\nWe talk about split DNS, where I've got\ninternal DNS servers that can resolve all\n\n355\n00:16:09,674 --> 00:16:13,080\nthe name of my internal hosts,\nall my clients, all my domain controllers,\n\n356\n00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,510\nthings like that.\n\n357\n00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,900\nBut from the outside, the public doesn't\nneed to be able to resolve the name of\n\n358\n00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,190\nclient two into an IP address.\n\n359\n00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,590\nSo, I've got a separate DNS server\nout there that does not replicate\n\n360\n00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,780\nwith the internal DNS server.\n\n361\n00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:29,500\nMost of the records on that DNS server in\nthe DMZ, are gonna be statically created.\n\n362\n00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,740\nAnd it's just the resource\nrecords that the public needs.\n\n363\n00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,640\nWWW, my remote access servers,\nthe front end of my direct access, and\n\n364\n00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,410\nthings like that.\n\n365\n00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:41,300\nYeah.\nWeb servers, remote access servers.\n\n366\n00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,250\n>> Yeah.\n\n367\n00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:42,970\nEmail servers.\n\n368\n00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,935\n>> Email servers.\n\n369\n00:16:43,935 --> 00:16:44,550\n>> Yep.\n\n370\n00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,750\nSo just some of the elements here that\nif you know that people are going\n\n371\n00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,411\nto be remoting in from the outside, or\nchecking their email from the outside.\n\n372\n00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:54,775\nHere's a good example of when we might\nalso need to include in the idea of\n\n373\n00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:55,370\na DMZ here.\n\n374\n00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,939\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, my drawing has expanded and\n\n375\n00:16:56,939 --> 00:16:58,765\nchanged, but I think it's still-\n>> I like it.\n\n376\n00:16:58,765 --> 00:17:00,375\n>> Still working for us a little bit.\n\n377\n00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,748\n>> And the extranet type stuff,\ntoo, right?\n\n378\n00:17:01,748 --> 00:17:04,290\nThings that you might want to,\nif you've got a business partner.\n\n379\n00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,009\nAnd you're running a web\napplication that they can,\n\n380\n00:17:07,009 --> 00:17:10,040\nyou're a raw supplier of\nresources to some manufacturer.\n\n381\n00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,895\nAnd they can come in and\norder product from you.\n\n382\n00:17:12,895 --> 00:17:15,800\nI'm not necessarily gonna give them\naccess to my internal network.\n\n383\n00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,087\n>> So, I can run a web app out\nthere on that web server, and so\n\n384\n00:17:18,087 --> 00:17:19,340\nit's kinda like an extranet.\n\n385\n00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,916\nA lot of these terms we've\ngone over in our network plus.\n\n386\n00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,749\nBut, so yeah.\n\n387\n00:17:23,749 --> 00:17:27,936\nJust anything you need to expose to\nthe outside is gonna sit out there in that\n\n388\n00:17:27,936 --> 00:17:31,206\nDMZ, or that screen subnet,\nor that perimeter network.\n\n389\n00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:31,832\n>> Yep.\n\n390\n00:17:31,832 --> 00:17:36,060\nSo again, providing that access from\nthe outside is pretty much a cool thing.\n\n391\n00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,692\nAnd it again,\n\n392\n00:17:36,692 --> 00:17:40,499\nreally does protect our internal resources\nthe way that we want them to be protected.\n\n393\n00:17:40,499 --> 00:17:43,020\nAnd so again,\na good part of our security and\n\n394\n00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,124\nour design that we actually wanna take\na look at as we go on through here.\n\n395\n00:17:47,124 --> 00:17:47,818\nOkay?\n\n396\n00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:48,320\n>> All right.\n\n397\n00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,710\n>> All right.\nSo,\n\n398\n00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,290\nthe idea of actually taking a look\nat the DMZ is actually pretty good.\n\n399\n00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,320\nNow, there's something else\nwe need to talk about.\n\n400\n00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,950\nAnd I know, Mike,\nthis is your favorite area.\n\n401\n00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,630\nOkay.\n\n402\n00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,680\nWhen we take a look at the idea\nof subnetting and DLANs here,\n\n403\n00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,005\nwhen we start to kind of play\naround with a little bit more.\n\n404\n00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:08,930\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Now before we actually get into\n\n405\n00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:09,515\nthat, right?\n\n406\n00:18:09,515 --> 00:18:12,023\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> A lot of times when we start actually\n\n407\n00:18:12,023 --> 00:18:16,806\nthinking about the idea of using Subnets\nhere, what can end up happening, and\n\n408\n00:18:16,806 --> 00:18:18,706\nI hope everybody can see that.\n\n409\n00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:22,456\nI don't know if I've actually made that\nlarge enough or not, to be able to see.\n\n410\n00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:25,689\nSometimes I think that I've made\nthese things large enough, and\n\n411\n00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:27,470\nyou might not be able to see those.\n\n412\n00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,060\n>> He forgets people like me have old\n\n413\n00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,580\neyes-\n>> That's right.\n\n414\n00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,530\n>> And have a little trouble seeing.\n\n415\n00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,500\n>> Yeah.\n>> And I'm the one that's legally blind.\n\n416\n00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,253\n>> He's got 20/10, don't let him take you.\n\n417\n00:18:35,253 --> 00:18:38,525\n[LAUGH]\n>> My luck, 20/900 or something like that.\n\n418\n00:18:38,525 --> 00:18:40,003\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's insane how bad my eyesight\n\n419\n00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:40,736\nis, okay?\n\n420\n00:18:40,736 --> 00:18:41,707\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n421\n00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:42,807\nSo, overall though.\n\n422\n00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:44,616\nOkay?\nLet's take a Look at the idea\n\n423\n00:18:44,616 --> 00:18:46,495\nof the white box right away.\n\n424\n00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:49,392\nOkay?\nIf everything inside of my network is\n\n425\n00:18:49,392 --> 00:18:51,617\nreally only under one network.\n\n426\n00:18:51,617 --> 00:18:53,912\n>> So, 172.16 with a 16 bit.\n\n427\n00:18:53,912 --> 00:18:54,676\n>> Yeah.\nMm-hm\n\n428\n00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,920\n>> 172.160.0, right at the top.\n\n429\n00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,205\nAnd, that's my entire building, Mike.\n\n430\n00:18:59,205 --> 00:18:59,720\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n431\n00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,265\n>> So\nif I had people that were in marketing.\n\n432\n00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:04,210\nRight?\nIf I had people that were in accounting,\n\n433\n00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,690\napparently I had accounting twice here.\n\n434\n00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,870\nOne was supposed to be something else.\n\n435\n00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,760\nI don't know what it was supposed\nto be now, at the top of my head.\n\n436\n00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,930\n>> Human resources?\n\n437\n00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,700\nHR.\n>> Yeah, let's do HR.\n\n438\n00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,370\n>> Yea.\n\n439\n00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,210\n>> Okay.\n\n440\n00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,393\nI have no clue why I did that.\n\n441\n00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:14,300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But there it is.\n\n442\n00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,540\n>> Accounting is a big part of it.\n\n443\n00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,810\n>> Accounting is a huge part of it.\n\n444\n00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,440\nOkay?\n\n445\n00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,480\nSo if we had everybody on one network,\n\n446\n00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,390\nwhat are some of\nthe downfalls of doing that?\n\n447\n00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,310\nOf putting every singe\nmachine on that same network?\n\n448\n00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,020\n>> I would say even just at the get go,\nnot even security wise,\n\n449\n00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,195\njust traffic congestion, right?\n\n450\n00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:30,010\n>> Right.\n>> Because how many nodes can you have?\n\n451\n00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,480\nYou guys remember from network plus.\n\n452\n00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,785\nHow many nodes can you\nhave on a class B sub net?\n\n453\n00:19:33,785 --> 00:19:35,720\n65,530 something.\n\n454\n00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,498\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, and if they're all.\n\n455\n00:19:39,498 --> 00:19:42,255\nIt's a lot of congestion on\nthat ethernet based network.\n\n456\n00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:43,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n457\n00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,060\nSo, when we start having\nsomething like this, right?\n\n458\n00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,650\nThe very fact is what we\nhave now is traffic that\n\n459\n00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,235\nshouldn't actually be\nable to see each other.\n\n460\n00:19:50,235 --> 00:19:50,820\nMm-hm.\n\n461\n00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,620\n>> Being able to see each other, right?\n\n462\n00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:57,110\nPeople in accounting that wanna keep stuff\nseparate from marketing and from HR,\n\n463\n00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,780\naren't really going to be able to do so.\n\n464\n00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,070\nThey're on the same sub net.\n\n465\n00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,100\nIf a broadcast goes out from\nan accounting machine, it goes where?\n\n466\n00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,800\nEverywhere.\n\n467\n00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,360\n>> Right.\n>> Okay?\n\n468\n00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,250\nSo again,\nbroadcast can be damaging for us.\n\n469\n00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,930\nSo what we try do is we talk about\nthe idea of implementing a sub net.\n\n470\n00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:14,335\nA sub net for\nus is a logical design element.\n\n471\n00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:14,970\nOkay?\n\n472\n00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,270\nSo this is nothing that you literally\nsee in terms of plugging in a device,\n\n473\n00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,000\nor plugging something that\nactually starts to work here.\n\n474\n00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,810\nThis is something, I hate to say it.\n\n475\n00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,280\nMike, if you're not good at it, you have\nto start off with paper and pencil here.\n\n476\n00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,040\nAnd what we're really doing is we're\ntaking that one big network block,\n\n477\n00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,570\nthe one that's in white\nup at the top here.\n\n478\n00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:36,660\nAnd we're essentially chopping\nthat up into logical smaller\n\n479\n00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,900\nnetworks is what we're doing.\n\n480\n00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,530\nOkay?\n\n481\n00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,770\nAnd so, if you are,\n\n482\n00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,390\nif you're sitting there going, Ronnie this\nis the first time I've heard about this.\n\n483\n00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:48,090\nGo over and check out the network plus\nshow, and also the CCNA shows and\n\n484\n00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,900\nthe ICND, the CCNT shows.\n\n485\n00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,980\n>> Look for any of them that have this\nguy's name on them because he subnets in\n\n486\n00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,180\nthe car on the way home listening\nto the radio for the fun of it.\n\n487\n00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,826\nHe's just like hm, I wonder how many\nnetworks I can come up with with this.\n\n488\n00:20:58,826 --> 00:20:59,774\n>> Yeah, that's true.\n\n489\n00:20:59,774 --> 00:21:02,950\n[LAUGH] But\nit's just one of those things where\n\n490\n00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,970\nhaving an understand of what\nwe want to do here, okay?\n\n491\n00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,240\nSo, the subnetting, it really does\nhelp us to really, first of all,\n\n492\n00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,520\nin terms of network management,\nseparate off that traffic, right?\n\n493\n00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,125\nSo, what I actually drew here\nis what we logically hope to do.\n\n494\n00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,005\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n495\n00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:20,880\n>> Okay?\nIs that all of the marketing\n\n496\n00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,460\nwill actually be in their own network.\n\n497\n00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,300\nOkay?\nAnd so,\n\n498\n00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,182\nI separated that out, you can actually\nsee it's a small network now.\n\n499\n00:21:26,182 --> 00:21:29,930\nThe 172.16.10, that was probably\na bad color to actually put it in.\n\n500\n00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,350\nBut it looked fine on my\ndesktop when I was doing it,\n\n501\n00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,960\nit doesn't look that\ngreat on the screen here.\n\n502\n00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,560\n>> It kind of bleeds a little bit.\n\n503\n00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,970\nSo, I can do that.\n\n504\n00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,390\nAnd that now, is what limits the scope or\n\n505\n00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,400\nthe broadness of that\nmarketing department.\n\n506\n00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,420\n>> Right, right.\n>> Just to that.\n\n507\n00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:47,290\n>> And now that you've got that broken up\nlike that, now we can control the traffic\n\n508\n00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,610\nthat's flowing back and\nforth between those two subnets.\n\n509\n00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,602\nIf it's all on one network, it's gonna\nbe much more difficult to control that\n\n510\n00:21:53,602 --> 00:21:56,450\none [INAUDIBLE] is broken it up\ninto those different subnets.\n\n511\n00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,650\nNow because we're doing that with routers,\nright?\n\n512\n00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:03,940\nWe can now set rules and\nsay all right look, the traffic from HR or\n\n513\n00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,095\nfrom marketing is not allowed to go\ninto that backbone of my network.\n\n514\n00:22:08,095 --> 00:22:09,680\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or, where all my data stores are, and\n\n515\n00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,730\nthings like that.\n\n516\n00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:14,174\nOr, they're not allowed to talk\ndirectly to the computers in HR or\n\n517\n00:22:14,174 --> 00:22:15,290\nanything like that.\n\n518\n00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,350\n>> But without those subnets,\nI really have trouble doing that.\n\n519\n00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:18,873\n>> Yeah.\n\n520\n00:22:18,873 --> 00:22:23,080\nThis is a big part of\nyour network education.\n\n521\n00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,040\nIs understanding the use of these subnets\nhere, and why they work the way they do.\n\n522\n00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,950\nSo subnet is a big important part of\nmaking sure that your network design is\n\n523\n00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:36,330\ngonna be scalable into the future for you,\nand have the protection that you need.\n\n524\n00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,310\nA lot of times, if you don't,\n\n525\n00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,740\nyou gonna see that where some\nthings need to be separated off.\n\n526\n00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,150\nIt's gonna be very difficult for\nyou to do so, and\n\n527\n00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,578\nthen you're gonna end up\nadding like a 192.168.\n\n528\n00:22:44,578 --> 00:22:46,530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it's not that it won't work.\n\n529\n00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,130\nRight?\n\n530\n00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,690\nBut, it's not gonna fall in line with\na lot of the other things that you\n\n531\n00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,930\nwant to implement.\n\n532\n00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:54,045\nSo, understanding at least\nthe basics of subnetting,\n\n533\n00:22:54,045 --> 00:22:59,585\nbeing able to do it incredible well is\nonly a benefit, Ryan, in my opinion.\n\n534\n00:22:59,585 --> 00:23:00,830\nIs only a benefit.\n\n535\n00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,615\nBut understanding the nature\nof doing this and\n\n536\n00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,915\nbeing able to divide up your network\nthe way that you need to and\n\n537\n00:23:04,915 --> 00:23:08,640\nthe way that you want to,\nreally does help out in terms of security.\n\n538\n00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,300\nAs well, because not only is the traffic\nnot going in between, but again,\n\n539\n00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,540\nwe can implement now filtering rules\nbetween those different subnets.\n\n540\n00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:20,240\nAnd we can do a whole bunch of other\nthings that really do make our security\n\n541\n00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,250\ndesign structure much greater, okay?\n\n542\n00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,410\nAnd so, having that understanding\nis pretty much a key\n\n543\n00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,280\npart of what we want\nto be able to do here.\n\n544\n00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,340\nSo, we're not gonna go into\nsubnetting right now, but\n\n545\n00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,720\nwhat we wanna do is make sure that\nwe understand that it is a key part\n\n546\n00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,320\nof our network design,\nour security design element here.\n\n547\n00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,750\n>> It's one of our layers.\n\n548\n00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:44,390\n>> It is what we have here, and so\nthere's a lot for us to actually go into.\n\n549\n00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,340\nNow, speaking of the idea of subnetting\n\n550\n00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,436\nbecause we're just talking about\nthat logical concept here, okay?\n\n551\n00:23:50,436 --> 00:23:51,017\n>> Gotta be implemented.\n\n552\n00:23:51,017 --> 00:23:55,570\n>> Yeah.\nOnce we get the subnetting down,\n\n553\n00:23:55,570 --> 00:24:00,140\nhow do we now make sure\nthat we're actually going\n\n554\n00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,445\nto be able to pull this off, and\nto make it work the way that we want to.\n\n555\n00:24:04,445 --> 00:24:05,167\nOkay?\n\n556\n00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:09,917\nThis is where we move into that second\nidea, which is now called VLANs.\n\n557\n00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:10,501\n>> VLANs.\n\n558\n00:24:10,501 --> 00:24:11,750\n>> Virtual LANs.\n\n559\n00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,750\nYep.\n\n560\n00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,834\nOkay.\n\n561\n00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:14,501\nAll right.\n\n562\n00:24:14,501 --> 00:24:17,750\nSo, apparently I did skip over something.\n\n563\n00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,090\nSo, let's start off here.\n\n564\n00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,950\nOkay?\nSo, without [LAUGH] the idea of VLANs at\n\n565\n00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,875\nall, also I've probably skipped\nsomething I probably shouldn't have.\n\n566\n00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,345\nBut here it is.\n\n567\n00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:28,627\nNormally we would plug\neverything into a switch.\n\n568\n00:24:28,627 --> 00:24:34,435\nAnd when we do so, we have what we\ncall now a physical segmentation.\n\n569\n00:24:34,435 --> 00:24:38,670\nThe very fact is, our network\nis kind of limited in this way.\n\n570\n00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,840\nEverything on the third floor\nis pretty much tied here.\n\n571\n00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,190\nEverything on the second floor\nis pretty much tied here.\n\n572\n00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,730\nEverything on the first floor\nis pretty much tied there.\n\n573\n00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,560\nSo once we have that, no big deal.\n\n574\n00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,170\nWe can actually implement three\ndifferent networks on them.\n\n575\n00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:55,060\nWe're perfectly fine, we're ready to go.\n\n576\n00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,750\nIt's no real big deal in terms of that.\n\n577\n00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,740\nBut what if my business changes?\n\n578\n00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,860\nThat's where I need\nthe subnetting to go on, and\n\n579\n00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,950\nthat's what we're actually describing.\n\n580\n00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,780\nSo I probably should've done this\none first, but it worked out.\n\n581\n00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,420\n>> And what you're saying there,\n\n582\n00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,690\nbecause now when you have it\nlaid out physically like that.\n\n583\n00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,350\nIn order to make changes to it,\nI've gotta go to the server closet or\n\n584\n00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,572\nI've gotta go find my patch panel.\n\n585\n00:25:16,572 --> 00:25:19,020\nI might gotta actually move things around\n\n586\n00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,560\nto move a computer from one\nsubheader to the other.\n\n587\n00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,180\n>> Yeah.\n\n588\n00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,510\nWith the VLAN implementation\non the switches,\n\n589\n00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:27,450\nwe can start logically grouping\nthese things together.\n\n590\n00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,970\nSo just like I can't tell you,\n\n591\n00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,730\nI can do the same thing that\nI did a little bit earlier.\n\n592\n00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,560\nOops.\nLet me not do that way.\n\n593\n00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,800\n>> Those were some nice boxes.\n\n594\n00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,250\n>> Yeah [LAUGH] And\nwe'll get to that box here in a moment.\n\n595\n00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,900\nNow, let's say that that\nis my marketing department.\n\n596\n00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,380\nOne on each floor?\n\n597\n00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,360\nYeah, if I want to.\n\n598\n00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,480\n>> Because you can do that.\n\n599\n00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,610\n>> Because I can do that.\n\n600\n00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:50,470\nAnd on using the idea of VLANs,\nvirtual LANs, I am now creating\n\n601\n00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:54,100\na network just by themselves, even though\nI'm using three separate switches.\n\n602\n00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,010\nSo a VLAN helps me now to\nlogically segment the switch.\n\n603\n00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,520\nSubnetting helps me to logically segment\nthe network in terms of the design and\n\n604\n00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,010\nthe IP addressing here.\n\n605\n00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:09,380\nBut VLANs actually help me to tell\nthe switch that these three devices,\n\n606\n00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,520\neven though they're on three\nseparate switches here,\n\n607\n00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,968\nare actually gonna be in the same subnet.\n\n608\n00:26:12,968 --> 00:26:16,820\nAnd so again,\nas we actually divide that up.\n\n609\n00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,630\nAnd what should end up\nhappening at some point,\n\n610\n00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,900\nif I can ever find it again, is this.\n\n611\n00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,880\nI don't know why I drew so many different\nones here, I didn't look at it before.\n\n612\n00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,370\nWhat we can do now is\nthat on the switches,\n\n613\n00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:33,410\nwe can now implement measures then,\nthat literally tell it that hey,\n\n614\n00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:36,300\nthere's gonna be a port on\nthe switch on the third floor.\n\n615\n00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,860\nOn the second floor, on the first floor.\n\n616\n00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,370\nGonna be in VLAN 10.\n\n617\n00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,490\nSame thing on the other ones here.\n\n618\n00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:45,150\nAnd so now, by using the actual\ntechnology in the switches.\n\n619\n00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,260\nThat's what actually\nimplements the subnetting.\n\n620\n00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:51,840\nSo we have a design in terms of subbing,\ndoing what we want to, but\n\n621\n00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,810\nnow for us to implement.\n\n622\n00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:57,880\nSo it's a combination of why\nwe want to be able to do that.\n\n623\n00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,090\nBut overall though, it really does\nhelp in terms of some security here.\n\n624\n00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:05,190\nBecause the default nature of the way\nthat the VLANs work on the switches,\n\n625\n00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,790\nis that even though you can see\nthat on that third floor switch\n\n626\n00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:12,300\nI have three different devices and\ntwo separate subnets now.\n\n627\n00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,240\nEven though they're on\nthe same physical switch,\n\n628\n00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,640\nthey cannot directly talk to each other.\n\n629\n00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,220\nSo I have put that logical separation, so\n\n630\n00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,350\nnow what that actually looks like for\nthe individual devices in that\n\n631\n00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,790\nis that they actually believe that\nthey're on two separate switches.\n\n632\n00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,090\nIt's kind of neat in how\nthey actually do it.\n\n633\n00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,790\nSo, there are some\nvulnerabilities in that and\n\n634\n00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,330\nwe'll get into that a little bit later on.\n\n635\n00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:35,540\nBut for us right now, understanding that\nthe nature of VLANs goes in to the design.\n\n636\n00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,030\nWe don't want to think\nabout it afterwards.\n\n637\n00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,310\nBecause if we start thinking\nabout it afterwards,\n\n638\n00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,520\nit's a lot more implementation.\n\n639\n00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,979\nWe do our big subnetting\nthat we want to do.\n\n640\n00:27:43,979 --> 00:27:45,539\nWe get that down, and\n\n641\n00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:50,572\nthen we implement the idea of VLANs\naccording to our subnet inquiry.\n\n642\n00:27:50,572 --> 00:27:52,904\n>> Exactly, and from the security\nstandpoint as Ronnie points out.\n\n643\n00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:56,066\nIf I compromise one of those\nmachines in a marketing VLAN, so\n\n644\n00:27:56,066 --> 00:27:59,920\nthat VLAN 10 there, I don't have free\nrange of the rest of the network.\n\n645\n00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,240\nI can see all those other nodes that\nare on that marketing VLAN, but\n\n646\n00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,560\nI can't easily just jump over to it,\n\n647\n00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,530\ndepending again on how you've set\nup your rules and things like that.\n\n648\n00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:12,220\nIt's gonna be more difficult for\nme to jump over to that accounting subnet.\n\n649\n00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,730\nI'm gonna have to pull\nout some new techniques,\n\n650\n00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:17,450\nmaybe techniques I don't have available\nand not be able to get over there to it.\n\n651\n00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,330\nSo layers of defense again\nis what we're getting at.\n\n652\n00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,550\n>> Yeah.\nWe've\n\n653\n00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:23,820\nstill got a little bit more on VLANs I\nwanna make sure that we talk about.\n\n654\n00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,596\nBut Mike,\nit looks like that I've talked so\n\n655\n00:28:25,596 --> 00:28:28,764\nmuch [CROSSTALK] that we're right about\nout of time on this first segment here.\n\n656\n00:28:28,764 --> 00:28:30,411\n>> Time flies when you're having fun,\nright? >> So we're gonna take a break and\n\n657\n00:28:30,411 --> 00:28:31,510\nwe're gonna come back.\n\n658\n00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,200\nWe're gonna finish up here on VLANs, and\n\n659\n00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,090\nwe're gonna move into some more network\ndesign considerations for security.\n\n660\n00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:37,721\nSo we'll see you after the break.\n\n661\n00:28:45,251 --> 00:28:49,342\nAll right, welcome back as we continue\non through our first episode here.\n\n662\n00:28:49,342 --> 00:28:53,421\nAnd the last thing that we were talking\nabout as we left off was we were talking\n\n663\n00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:56,120\nabout the idea of using VLANs and\nsubnets as well.\n\n664\n00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,292\nI want to jump back right\ninto that right now.\n\n665\n00:28:58,292 --> 00:29:01,210\nBecause there's one more thing I wanted\nto show you in terms of the VLANs and\n\n666\n00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,380\nthe implementation of it, too.\n\n667\n00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,030\nNow, what we're talking about\na little bit earlier here\n\n668\n00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:09,920\nis actually allowing the switches to\nessentially put ports on certain VLANs.\n\n669\n00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,322\nNow, what if you only had one switch.\n\n670\n00:29:12,322 --> 00:29:14,220\nCan you still do that?\n\n671\n00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,200\nWell, Mike, guess what?\n\n672\n00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,100\nYeah, you can.\n\n673\n00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,896\nYeah.\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n674\n00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:18,713\n>> Yeah, as long as it's supported, right?\n\n675\n00:29:18,713 --> 00:29:19,465\n>> Yeah, so\n\n676\n00:29:19,465 --> 00:29:25,360\nyou do actually have to get one that\nwill support the idea of VLANs here.\n\n677\n00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,290\n>> The one I have at my house,\nI just cut it in half.\n\n678\n00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,695\n>> Yeah, there you go, you can do that.\n\n679\n00:29:28,695 --> 00:29:32,440\n>> Yeah, but a lot of the switches\nthat you tend to use,\n\n680\n00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,210\nyou can actually put those\nports into one VLAN.\n\n681\n00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,200\nIt doesn't actually have\nto be implemented together.\n\n682\n00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,090\nThis could actually be on another VLAN.\n\n683\n00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,975\nAnd it would be nice if I could\nchange the colors of that, but\n\n684\n00:29:41,975 --> 00:29:43,270\nknowing my luck\n>> And\n\n685\n00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,110\nwe talked about this in\nthe Network Plus episodes.\n\n686\n00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:48,930\nThese devices, these are VLAN switches,\nor layer 3 switches,\n\n687\n00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:52,510\nwhere they kind of cross that\nborder between layer 2 and layer 3.\n\n688\n00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,790\nBecause they can work at the IP rate.\n\n689\n00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,964\n>> Yep.\nSo a lot of times for us,\n\n690\n00:29:55,964 --> 00:29:57,385\nwhen we start doing this here.\n\n691\n00:29:57,385 --> 00:30:00,823\nEven on the single switch, as long as\nit can support the idea of using VLANs,\n\n692\n00:30:00,823 --> 00:30:01,590\nyou can do this.\n\n693\n00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,730\nSo this way, if I only had one switch, I\nstill need to create three or four VLANs,\n\n694\n00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:08,110\nbecause I need to subnet that,\nI can still do it even on one switch.\n\n695\n00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,040\nEven though I showed you with just\nmultiple switches a little bit earlier.\n\n696\n00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,284\nI wanted to make sure that you actually\nunderstood that you can still do that.\n\n697\n00:30:14,284 --> 00:30:15,603\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Logically inside it,\n\n698\n00:30:15,603 --> 00:30:20,023\nso if you added a new file server, and\nyou wanted to put a file server on VLAN 2.\n\n699\n00:30:20,023 --> 00:30:23,578\nAll you gotta do is go into your\nconfiguration page on that switch, and\n\n700\n00:30:23,578 --> 00:30:28,080\nyou can take with that particular port,\nand assign it to that VLAN 2 ID.\n\n701\n00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,920\n>> And don't forget,\nif you want to learn more about that.\n\n702\n00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,230\nAgain, check out our\nseries there in Cisco and\n\n703\n00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,770\nyou'll be able to see how we actually\ndo create VLANs on these switches.\n\n704\n00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,190\nThat normally we would do that.\n\n705\n00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,780\nBut it is a part of that network\ndesign that we're talking about, so\n\n706\n00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,180\nwe want to make sure that\nwe do mention that as well.\n\n707\n00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:47,840\nSo now we've covered essentially\nthe idea of what we talked about, DMZs.\n\n708\n00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,370\n>> Right.\nGot to start on the outside.\n\n709\n00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,310\n>> We talked about the idea of DMZs here.\n\n710\n00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,120\nAnd then moving internally here,\n\n711\n00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,820\nwe went from that idea to talk about\nthe network design in terms of subnetting.\n\n712\n00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,650\nAnd the idea that how we implement\nthe subnets and what we're doing.\n\n713\n00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,550\nSo for us, as we move on next here.\n\n714\n00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,980\nWhere are we actually going here?\n\n715\n00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,430\n>> I think we're gonna hit NAT maybe next?\n\n716\n00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,874\n>> Okay yeah.\nLet's go ahead and\n\n717\n00:31:08,874 --> 00:31:10,875\ntalk about the idea of NAT here.\n\n718\n00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,320\nYou wanna describe the idea of NAT for\n\n719\n00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,115\nus [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah,\n\n720\n00:31:13,115 --> 00:31:14,606\nNAT is network address translation.\n\n721\n00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,598\n>> And again, another one of these where,\nguys, if you need the basic concepts\n\n722\n00:31:17,598 --> 00:31:20,725\nof what it is, probably jump back over\nto say Network+ or something like that.\n\n723\n00:31:20,725 --> 00:31:22,330\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But NAT is network address translation.\n\n724\n00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:26,038\nIt was something that I think they kind\nof implemented really more than anything,\n\n725\n00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:29,840\nbecause our IPv4 range was getting short\nand we were running out of v4 addresses.\n\n726\n00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,970\nAnd this is something that\nreally helped with that.\n\n727\n00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,470\nAnd also, because it protects it.\n\n728\n00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:38,870\nOur hosts are not visible\ndirectly to the Internet.\n\n729\n00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,320\nWhat's going to happen is instead\nof giving every computer,\n\n730\n00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,700\nevery node on your network,\na public v4 address.\n\n731\n00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,980\nBecause remember,\nto get out to the Internet,\n\n732\n00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,300\nI've got to have a routable v4 address,\nan IANA or ICANN.\n\n733\n00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,157\nTook off some of the addresses from\neach one of the classes, class A,\n\n734\n00:31:54,157 --> 00:31:56,292\nclass B, class C, and\nthey're gonna be private.\n\n735\n00:31:56,292 --> 00:32:00,333\nThey called them private non-routables,\nthe ten dots in the class A range.\n\n736\n00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:03,958\nWell, 172.16 through 172.31.\n\n737\n00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:06,667\n255.255 in the class B range.\n\n738\n00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:10,917\nAnd then anything that starts with\na 192.168 in that class C range.\n\n739\n00:32:10,917 --> 00:32:13,467\nAnd those are private,\nnon-routeable addresses,\n\n740\n00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:17,050\nwhich means those addresses are not\nallowed to go out to the Internet.\n\n741\n00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:21,250\nBorder routers, if they see a packet\ncoming through with a source address\n\n742\n00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,798\nthat's in one of those private ranges,\nit's gonna drop it.\n\n743\n00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:26,215\nIt's not gonna allow it to go through.\n\n744\n00:32:26,215 --> 00:32:29,420\nAnd just like you guys if you're\nsitting at your house right now,\n\n745\n00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,600\nI can pretty much guarantee that if\nyou open up a command prompt and\n\n746\n00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,160\ndo an IP config,\nyou've got a private IP address.\n\n747\n00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,470\nThat's going to fall in one of\nthose rangers I just mentioned.\n\n748\n00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,900\nYet, here you are watching out show.\n\n749\n00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,492\nYou've got internet access.\n\n750\n00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:44,560\nBecause there's device on your network\nthat is doing network address translation.\n\n751\n00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:49,050\nIt's taking your private IP\naddress off of that packet,\n\n752\n00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,870\nsetting it aside, and\nreplacing it with the public IP\n\n753\n00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,710\naddress that was assigned to the front\nend of that device, typically a router.\n\n754\n00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:00,630\nAnd that's gonna allow that packet\nto travel out to the internet and\n\n755\n00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,530\nhit whatever resource it is.\n\n756\n00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:05,820\nThat resource,\nlike say some website like newegg.com,\n\n757\n00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,070\nhas no idea about you back there\non that private network, right?\n\n758\n00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,260\nIt sees that packet\ncoming from that router,\n\n759\n00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:15,420\nreturns the web page back to the router,\nthe router then removes its public IP\n\n760\n00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:20,780\naddress put your private IP address back\non and then sends that packet on it.\n\n761\n00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,270\nSo you were able to go out to the internet\nbut never directly expose your IP\n\n762\n00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:27,210\naddress or information about\nyour node to the internet.\n\n763\n00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,200\n>> Yeah.\nSo here in this drawing in this diagram,\n\n764\n00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,170\nwhat I've actually put in here, okay?\n\n765\n00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:34,830\nIs that internally I have one of\nthose private IP address ranges.\n\n766\n00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:37,740\nThe RC is RFC 1918,\nI always remember that.\n\n767\n00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,260\nThat actually tells us that hey,\n\n768\n00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:44,000\nthese are addresses that are not\nallowed on the internet, okay.\n\n769\n00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,790\nSo if I want to give access\nto those addresses and\n\n770\n00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:49,000\nI'm still using this\ninternally in my network.\n\n771\n00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,520\nThrough my router then,\n\n772\n00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,540\nI can set up something that we call\nNAT Network Address Translation and\n\n773\n00:33:55,540 --> 00:34:01,450\nattach all those IP addresses to this\none IP address that we see right here.\n\n774\n00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,880\nThat I'm actually putting an arrow to.\n\n775\n00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,900\nNow, in that attachment and\nwhat we're doing.\n\n776\n00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,580\nTypically, this is the way that we\nsee it done most commonly is that all\n\n777\n00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:15,920\nthe devices inside of my network get\nattached to that same IP address.\n\n778\n00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,670\nNow, if that happens for\n\n779\n00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:21,000\nus, what ends up happening is that\nthey keep a small database inside.\n\n780\n00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,060\nI didn't make this box big enough here.\n\n781\n00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,760\nBut all of those devices\ninternally on my network.\n\n782\n00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,380\nWe'll now go ahead and\nput the public IP address\n\n783\n00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:36,130\nas well as attach a port\nnumber to those individually.\n\n784\n00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:39,690\n>> Cuz that router, it's gotta know you've\ngot several nodes internally that are all\n\n785\n00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,010\ngoing out to the Internet.\n\n786\n00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,070\nAnd he's taken your private\nIP address off, and\n\n787\n00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:45,430\nreplaced it with the public\nassigned address.\n\n788\n00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:49,180\nWhen that traffic comes back how does he\nknow which node to send that back to.\n\n789\n00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:49,700\n>> Yeah.\n\n790\n00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,170\n>> That little port\nnumber you put on there.\n\n791\n00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,860\nWhen it comes back it's gonna have\nthat port and it can say, oh yeah,\n\n792\n00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:59,690\nthat was 172.16.10.115 and it can pull\nhis address off, put your address on,\n\n793\n00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:03,210\nand you get the traffic you requested and\nnot the traffic that Rhonda requested.\n\n794\n00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:05,490\n>> Yup so as it goes through, and\n\n795\n00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:08,210\nlet's say it actually hits\nthe comptia.org, right?\n\n796\n00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:08,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n797\n00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:13,352\n>> So when it hits comptia.org, and\nwe're going to pull a web page back.\n\n798\n00:35:13,352 --> 00:35:17,168\nWhat's gonna happen is that now that\nthe address has been translated,\n\n799\n00:35:17,168 --> 00:35:19,720\nwhen the comptia.org responds back,\n\n800\n00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,700\nit's actually going to send it\nback to this address right here.\n\n801\n00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,010\nAnd then in the translation table\nit will actually look it up and\n\n802\n00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:31,130\nsend it back to whatever machine that we\nactually want it to go to, all right?\n\n803\n00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,920\nSo, it's not really a security\nimplementation in terms of\n\n804\n00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,155\njust about security.\n\n805\n00:35:36,155 --> 00:35:36,670\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n806\n00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,150\n>> But it does provide that\nsecurity benefit for us and\n\n807\n00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,620\nthe very fact that devices\nout on the internet,\n\n808\n00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,030\nthey don't know how many\ndevices are actually connected.\n\n809\n00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,750\n>> Right.\n\n810\n00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:45,700\n>> And to the entire Internet.\n\n811\n00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,330\nIt just looks like my entire network\nis actually one very busy device,\n\n812\n00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,240\nit what it looks like.\n\n813\n00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,510\n>> Absolutely, as a bad guy, one of the\nthings that I need to do is try to figure\n\n814\n00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,500\nout what network range\nyou're using internally.\n\n815\n00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,910\nEspecially if I'm going to do some\nspoofing or anything like that.\n\n816\n00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:02,450\nI've got to try and figure that out and\nusing NAT it hides that.\n\n817\n00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:05,240\nI mean it's not the most bullet proof\nsolution or anything like that, but\n\n818\n00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,120\nin combination with everything else,\nit's definitely a big setup.\n\n819\n00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,460\nIt's keeping those hosts,\n\n820\n00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:13,420\nthat internal network range from being\nexposed directly to the internet.\n\n821\n00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,550\n>> Yeah, now NAT can be implemented in\na couple of different variations here.\n\n822\n00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,110\nFor us, this is the most\npopular one in which we have\n\n823\n00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,995\nevery single address inside\nbeing mapped to one address.\n\n824\n00:36:22,995 --> 00:36:25,300\n>> Right.\n>> There is another one that's called\n\n825\n00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:30,475\ndynamic NAT which is pool of public\naddresses mapped to other devices inside.\n\n826\n00:36:30,475 --> 00:36:31,040\n>> Mm-hm.\nAnd\n\n827\n00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,300\nthere is even a one to one\ntranslation that we have.\n\n828\n00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,400\nAnd a lot of times if you do that, it\nmight be because you are actually running\n\n829\n00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,620\nan internal internal web to run on,\nyou do that.\n\n830\n00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,940\n>> Right.\n>> Exposes you to the outside but\n\n831\n00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,010\nyou can if you choose to.\n\n832\n00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:41,810\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n833\n00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,120\n>> Be able to do something like that.\n\n834\n00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,480\nSo usually you'll see that there\nare multiple implementations,\n\n835\n00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,390\nthis is by far the most popular It's the\none that used, like what Mike mentioned\n\n836\n00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:52,370\nhere, inside of most of your\nlittle wireless access routers.\n\n837\n00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,010\n>> Little home devices.\n\n838\n00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:53,550\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n839\n00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,530\n>> As well.\nAnd then on big networks, or\n\n840\n00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,310\neven small to medium sized networks,\nlike what we have here at ITPro TV.\n\n841\n00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,750\nWe still used NAT as well.\n\n842\n00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,400\nAnd that's because it gives us the ability\nto have as many addresses that we need\n\n843\n00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,480\ninside of our network, but then on\nthe internet we're actually limited to our\n\n844\n00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,680\nviable public IP addresses here.\n\n845\n00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,520\nAnd so for us,\nit is a security consideration.\n\n846\n00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,745\nHeck, it's actually essential in terms\nof getting access to the internet.\n\n847\n00:37:15,745 --> 00:37:19,140\n>> Cuz in this scenario here,\nwe had to purchase one public IP address.\n\n848\n00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,890\n>> Yeah. That's it. >> I could have a\nthousand nodes back there in my lands, and\n\n849\n00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:26,020\nI don't have to have a thousand IP\naddresses, public IP addresses.\n\n850\n00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:31,260\nSo I save money, and it reduces the\nconsumption of those IP, the v4 addresses.\n\n851\n00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,060\n>> Yeah.\n\n852\n00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:36,760\nSo for us here,\nthis is a great design consideration\n\n853\n00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,420\nthat we may also want to make\nsure we have under control here.\n\n854\n00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,370\nKeeping this database table\nthat we generally find,\n\n855\n00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,240\na lot of times you may actually implement\nit directly on the router itself.\n\n856\n00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,420\nYou can set up another\nserver to handle this.\n\n857\n00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,470\nA lot of times you can actually go\ndirectly into the router to configure this\n\n858\n00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,120\nand make it work for you.\n\n859\n00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,380\nThe idea here is we now also have to\nremember that we have to protect that\n\n860\n00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,410\nrouter as well from access because\nwe don't want this information\n\n861\n00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,500\ngetting out there to the internet either.\n\n862\n00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,280\nAnd so it's a big part of\nwhat we're gonna be doing.\n\n863\n00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,810\nSo another element that we\nneed to actually implement\n\n864\n00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:10,420\nin terms of our design and\nour security, too.\n\n865\n00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:14,404\nAll right, now here, I know,\nis a favorite of Mike's,\n\n866\n00:38:14,404 --> 00:38:16,250\nwhich is the idea of remote access.\n\n867\n00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,750\nSo what's the big deal\nabout remote access.\n\n868\n00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:24,510\n>> I mean, the way networks are going\nnowadays, over the last years,\n\n869\n00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,640\ndecade or so, it's really changed a lot,\n\n870\n00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,320\nwhere everybody has their own\npersonal devices, computers at home.\n\n871\n00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,350\nMost of you probably have several devices,\ncomputers at home,\n\n872\n00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,070\nlaptops that you travel with.\n\n873\n00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:38,650\nAnd as far as the workplace goes,\nwe now allow our users,\n\n874\n00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,930\nor most networks allow their\nusers to work from home.\n\n875\n00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:42,770\nIf they want to.\n\n876\n00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:45,160\nI know people that don't\neven go to the office.\n\n877\n00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,690\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> They live here in Gainesville yet\n\n878\n00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,170\nthey work down in Miami.\n\n879\n00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,800\nAnd they do it all remotely.\n\n880\n00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,650\nAllowing my users,\nthey're more productive.\n\n881\n00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:55,160\nIf they can get to that information\nwhen they're out there travelling,\n\n882\n00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,940\nwhen they're making those sales calls.\n\n883\n00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,250\nHeck, if my users wanna work at night,\nand I don't have to pay them,\n\n884\n00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,050\nI already pay them for nine to five,\nthat's okay with me, right?\n\n885\n00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:06,500\nBut again, give them access to\nthose resources that they need, but\n\n886\n00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,400\nhow do I do that securely?\n\n887\n00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,640\nI mean, I don't just wanna open up\nmy file servers to the Internet, or\n\n888\n00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,930\nanything like that.\n\n889\n00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:15,110\nSo we've gotta figure out a way\nthat we can control that access and\n\n890\n00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,290\nlimit it to just the authorized people.\n\n891\n00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:20,130\n>> All right, so I've got a diagram\nhere that kind of shows what we're\n\n892\n00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:20,930\ntalking about.\n\n893\n00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:24,790\nSo, I have a database and\nyou can see that little database up there.\n\n894\n00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,560\n>> Right.\n\n895\n00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,500\n>> That is on this diagram here.\n\n896\n00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,940\nSo, Mike what is the problem with\nme connecting from the outside.\n\n897\n00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,770\n>> And getting into those resources.\n\n898\n00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:38,210\n>> Directly to that\nparticular database there.\n\n899\n00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,327\nI have a firewall on my network, right.\n\n900\n00:39:40,327 --> 00:39:43,480\n>> And physically, as far as the layout\ngoes, the internet is just a big,\n\n901\n00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,600\nfat mesh network.\n\n902\n00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,760\nIf you stop and think about it,\nyour office is connected to the internet.\n\n903\n00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,550\nYour home is connected to the internet.\n\n904\n00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:52,510\nIt's a big, fat mesh network,\nit makes sense that I should be able\n\n905\n00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,460\nto connect the two and\nwe most definitely can.\n\n906\n00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,910\nIt's really not that difficult.\n\n907\n00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:59,083\nThe problem is, is we're going\nover a public infrastructure.\n\n908\n00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:02,667\nWe're going across the internet\nto get to that work network.\n\n909\n00:40:02,667 --> 00:40:04,560\nAnd so now I'm transferring file and\n\n910\n00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,500\nstuff like that this that's\ncorporate sensitive data.\n\n911\n00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,651\nAnd I'm putting it at risk, because\nsomebody out there on the Internet could\n\n912\n00:40:10,651 --> 00:40:13,720\nbe eavesdropping or capturing that\ninformation, and I can't have that.\n\n913\n00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,500\nSo back in the day,\nwe limited the remote access,\n\n914\n00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,350\nbecause it was difficult to secure, and\n\n915\n00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:23,210\nnow we've got several solutions that allow\nme to protect it as it's traveling across.\n\n916\n00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:26,230\nWe'll use the term tunneling, okay?\n\n917\n00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,320\nAnd that's using these remote\naccess protocols to encapsulate\n\n918\n00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,560\nyour normal LAN traffic, and\nwrap it up inside this protective layer.\n\n919\n00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,040\nSo it gets added on the way out, and\nthen it goes through the Internet, and it\n\n920\n00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:42,810\nkeeps the bad guys from being able to see,\nor manipulate, or work with that data, and\n\n921\n00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:47,810\nthen once it hits the other end, that\nencapsulation is peeled back and we're\n\n922\n00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:51,050\nleft with our normal LAN traffic that can\ntravel across my corporate network, and\n\n923\n00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:54,900\nI can gain access to whatever\nresources I'm authorized access.\n\n924\n00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,810\n>> Yeah, so a lot of times when we\nstart talking about doing the idea\n\n925\n00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:01,140\nof remote access, the protection that\nwe're normally implementing here,\n\n926\n00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,360\nis we have to think about, well,\nare we gonna allow for this first.\n\n927\n00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,645\nAnd we are, we wanna protect those,\nor something, and\n\n928\n00:41:06,645 --> 00:41:09,954\nusually the main protection that we offer\ntoday is really the idea of use of VPNs,\n\n929\n00:41:09,954 --> 00:41:13,263\nand you might wonder, all right Ronnie,\nyou just replaced two lines with this,\n\n930\n00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:15,134\nwith what looks like\na possible tunnel here.\n\n931\n00:41:15,134 --> 00:41:17,258\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Why does that help?\n\n932\n00:41:17,258 --> 00:41:20,110\nWell, it helps out in\na couple of different ways.\n\n933\n00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:20,770\nRight Mike?\n\n934\n00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,900\n>> Yeah.\n>> The first is that it actually offers\n\n935\n00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,720\nan encrypted end to end connection, okay?\n\n936\n00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,940\nSo whether I'm actually on\none computer at a Starbucks,\n\n937\n00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,206\nhopefully I'm not doing\nthis at a Starbucks.\n\n938\n00:41:30,206 --> 00:41:30,720\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n939\n00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,960\n>> But when I'm at one computer at\na Starbucks, I can actually make\n\n940\n00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:39,610\na connection to my firewall here, and\nmake an encrypted connection first, okay?\n\n941\n00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:42,830\nThen, the other thing that\nactually makes this good,\n\n942\n00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:46,760\nis that it also sends encrypted traffic\nthrough that encrypted connection.\n\n943\n00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,910\nWe think that what it should do is\ndo exactly this, in which, you and\n\n944\n00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,930\nI, we're on the Internet,\nwe don't actually see the traffic.\n\n945\n00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,560\nIt's just like this tunnel has\nactually been created, and we're\n\n946\n00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,100\nsending data through it, but nobody else\non the Internet really is able to see it.\n\n947\n00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,660\nI say that, but\nthey're able to see something.\n\n948\n00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,070\n>> They see the packets,\nbut it's all encrypted so\n\n949\n00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,250\nthey're not going to be able to read it.\n\n950\n00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,560\nThey're not going to be\nable to manipulate it.\n\n951\n00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,390\nDepending on the protocol.\n\n952\n00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:11,010\nNow, we do have to make sure that\nwe use the some protocols don't\n\n953\n00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:11,915\nsupport encryption or.\n\n954\n00:42:11,915 --> 00:42:12,614\n>> Yeah.\n>> Well we need to bring\n\n955\n00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,119\nsomething else along with\nthem to do the encryption.\n\n956\n00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:14,631\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n957\n00:42:14,631 --> 00:42:17,079\nthings like that and we'll,\nwe'll dive a little bit deeper into there.\n\n958\n00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:19,170\n>> Yeah.\n>> But as Ryan's saying here,\n\n959\n00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,864\nwe're doing what we call a remote access,\nwe can also do a VPN,\n\n960\n00:42:22,864 --> 00:42:25,392\nwe can do site to site\ntype tunnels as well.\n\n961\n00:42:25,392 --> 00:42:29,712\n>> Yeah, so a lot of this here for us is\nsomething that we want to make sure that\n\n962\n00:42:29,712 --> 00:42:32,918\nwe think about in terms of\nactually getting it set up and\n\n963\n00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:36,300\ndoing what we actually needed to do here.\n\n964\n00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,620\nIf we're gonna allow for remote access,\nif we're gonna allow for\n\n965\n00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,570\ntelecommuters, we're\ngonna actually allow for\n\n966\n00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:45,360\nthis, we wanna make sure that we have\nthis so that we can protect our traffic.\n\n967\n00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,000\nIt's not necessarily just\nthe traffic inside of my network\n\n968\n00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,580\ncuz again the firewall provides that\nperimeter defense that I need and\n\n969\n00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,899\nreally does block out a lot.\n\n970\n00:42:52,899 --> 00:42:53,660\n>> Right.\n>> What you and\n\n971\n00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:58,600\nI have to worry about is actually what's\nin between us and our firewall here, and\n\n972\n00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,110\nproviding for that for remote access is\na big part of security, if organized.\n\n973\n00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,290\nNow, if we did it like we use to, right?\n\n974\n00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:09,270\nWhich we set up our own network, and\nif Mike needed access to the network,\n\n975\n00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:10,650\nhe would just drive in on the weekends.\n\n976\n00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:12,470\nI'm glad,\nI'm sure Mike would've loved that.\n\n977\n00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,000\nOh, I forgot to do this at work.\n\n978\n00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,390\nI just need access to the computer.\n\n979\n00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:18,880\nWell, Mike would have to go ahead,\neven on the weekend, and drive in.\n\n980\n00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,830\n>> Yup.\n\n981\n00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,070\n>> But now being able to set\nup the idea of remote access,\n\n982\n00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,730\nit's not only just about convenience,\n\n983\n00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:26,580\nit's the ability to get more done that\nhe doesn't have to take time out to do.\n\n984\n00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:30,550\nHe logs in home from home,\nhe makes this secured connection,\n\n985\n00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:33,790\nand it's something that we\nwant to make sure we plan for.\n\n986\n00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:37,490\nWe start doing it again as an addition to\nit, there's so many other things like oh,\n\n987\n00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:38,870\nam I gonna break this as I do it?\n\n988\n00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:40,740\nAm I gonna mess this up?\n\n989\n00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:44,290\nNow that we have this, we implement it\nall together in the design element,\n\n990\n00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:47,500\nit costs us nothing during the design,\nbut it actually will save us\n\n991\n00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,590\na lot of time during the implementation\nmeasure of what we have here.\n\n992\n00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:54,360\n>> It's important we just understand and\nwe get it set up properly,\n\n993\n00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,910\ncuz you are talking about\nnow exposing your network,\n\n994\n00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,180\nallowing this traffic to come through.\n\n995\n00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,990\nSo we gotta set it up properly cuz I\ndon't want just anybody to be able to\n\n996\n00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:04,950\nconnect to that remote access server and\nattempt to gain access to my server.\n\n997\n00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:09,150\nWe talked about a DMZ earlier, and that\nremote access server's sitting out there\n\n998\n00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:14,670\nin that DMZ, and he's the one that\ngonna decide, or he's the one that's\n\n999\n00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:19,010\nallowed to go through that back firewall\nand gain access to that corporate network.\n\n1000\n00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,140\nSo we've got to make sure\nif he becomes compromised,\n\n1001\n00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,670\nwe could expose all of our data.\n\n1002\n00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:25,136\nSo we've got to make sure\nwe set it up properly,\n\n1003\n00:44:25,136 --> 00:44:29,270\nunderstand the protocols that we're using,\nthe different choices we have for\n\n1004\n00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:32,786\nremote access solutions,\nMicrosoft World, we've got our VPNs,\n\n1005\n00:44:32,786 --> 00:44:36,512\nrouting remote access server, and\ndirect access nowadays we can use.\n\n1006\n00:44:36,512 --> 00:44:38,717\nAnd so, several different\noptions that we can set up.\n\n1007\n00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:43,870\n>> Yeah, so again, including that in and\nout design, pretty much a key concept.\n\n1008\n00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:46,950\nIf we're never going to allow for remote\naccess, we don't have to worry about it.\n\n1009\n00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,320\nThe reality is what?\n\n1010\n00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,520\nAll of us are gonna use this.\n\n1011\n00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,090\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1012\n00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,740\n>> Because we don't wanna\ndrive in on the weekends.\n\n1013\n00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,490\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1014\n00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:56,850\nFor branch offices to be able to\nconnect back to resources that are on\n\n1015\n00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:59,490\nthe corporate network,\ncuz most of my resources reside there,\n\n1016\n00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:02,780\nand they've gotta be able to do their job,\nthey've gotta get access to that data.\n\n1017\n00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,900\nHow do I give them access to that data.\n\n1018\n00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,210\nYou need to keep that data secure.\n\n1019\n00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:10,825\n>> All right, so just about everything\nwe've talked about when we start tape and\n\n1020\n00:45:10,825 --> 00:45:14,165\nlook at it back on our original design\nelement here it terms of defense and\n\n1021\n00:45:14,165 --> 00:45:14,958\ndepth, right?\n\n1022\n00:45:14,958 --> 00:45:19,845\nWhat we have is that we've discussed\nthe idea of perimeter security, so far,\n\n1023\n00:45:19,845 --> 00:45:23,843\nand even a little bit of network security,\nnot completely, but\n\n1024\n00:45:23,843 --> 00:45:28,780\nthe use of VLANs and subnetting kind\nof reside in that network layer here.\n\n1025\n00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,350\nThe firewalls and actually the use\nof NAT and even remote access,\n\n1026\n00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:36,290\nare really out there at the edge\nof the perimeter that we have, but\n\n1027\n00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:38,230\nremember that what we\nwant to do is provide for\n\n1028\n00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:42,110\neverything, it's not just enough that\nwere securing the outside, okay?\n\n1029\n00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,630\nAnd leaving everything else exposed.\n\n1030\n00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:44,254\n>> What is it that my mom used to say?\n\n1031\n00:45:44,254 --> 00:45:45,822\n>> You know?\n>> Don't put all your eggs in one basket.\n\n1032\n00:45:45,822 --> 00:45:47,690\n>> Don't.\nYeah, that's right, yeah.\n\n1033\n00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:48,350\nThat's huge.\n\n1034\n00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:49,658\n>> Kinda corny, but\nit's really what we're looking at.\n\n1035\n00:45:49,658 --> 00:45:53,410\n>> Yeah, there's no doubt that a lot\nof times we think, I went ahead and\n\n1036\n00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:58,261\nI bought this $1200 firewall, it should do\neverything that I need to do, except for\n\n1037\n00:45:58,261 --> 00:46:00,870\nwhen something gets passed the firewall.\n\n1038\n00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:04,110\nIn other words, you allow a guest\nto come into your network and\n\n1039\n00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,690\nthey now bring an infected machine in.\n\n1040\n00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:06,260\n>> Right.\n\n1041\n00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,540\n>> Now you're actually in trouble.\n\n1042\n00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,560\n>> Yep.\n>> So there's a lot of other things we\n\n1043\n00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:14,002\nalso want to make sure that we are taking\na look at and talking about as well, okay?\n\n1044\n00:46:14,002 --> 00:46:17,935\nSo, we are moving forward then into,\nlet's see,\n\n1045\n00:46:17,935 --> 00:46:23,600\nwe talked about DMZs, VLANs,\nsubnetting, and NAT and Remote Access.\n\n1046\n00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,970\nWe now need to take a look at some\nof the other implementations here.\n\n1047\n00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:30,110\nLet's start off with the big one which is\nessentially network access control, okay?\n\n1048\n00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:34,130\n>> Okay.\n>> And Mike is a NAP in Microsoft,\n\n1049\n00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:38,325\na guru in this particular area.\n\n1050\n00:46:38,325 --> 00:46:39,951\n[CROSSTALK] So,\nlet's take a look at the big one.\n\n1051\n00:46:39,951 --> 00:46:43,164\nI don't have an actually drawing here\nbecause this is a little bit more\n\n1052\n00:46:43,164 --> 00:46:45,310\ncomplicated in what we're doing here.\n\n1053\n00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:47,360\nBut let's talk about what\nthe access network control is.\n\n1054\n00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,290\n>> It really is a great concept.\n\n1055\n00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:51,210\nI mean it's been around for a few years\nnow, a few editions of Windows anyway.\n\n1056\n00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:56,830\nAs we're talking about allowing users to\ngain access to my network remotely, so\n\n1057\n00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:59,450\nthey can work fro home, so\nthey can work from that hotel.\n\n1058\n00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:01,840\nSo they can check on the latest\nwarehouse numbers so\n\n1059\n00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:06,640\nthey can sell the product while they're\nout there at this customer, what have you.\n\n1060\n00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,740\nSo I'm allowing these strange computers\nto gain access to my network,\n\n1061\n00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,830\nand as an IT person, Ronnie, when's\nthe last time you went to one of your\n\n1062\n00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:16,790\nend user's house to\ncheck on their machine.\n\n1063\n00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:17,420\n>> I haven't.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1064\n00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:17,920\n>> Right?\n\n1065\n00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,050\nExactly. I'm not gonna do that, but\nI don't know what their machine is like.\n\n1066\n00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:22,240\nDo they take care of it?\n\n1067\n00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,310\nYou know,\nare they running antivirus software?\n\n1068\n00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:25,680\nIs it being kept up to date?\n\n1069\n00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,780\nAre they getting their Windows updates?\n\n1070\n00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,720\nYou know, who knows,\nit's a family computer.\n\n1071\n00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,470\n>> Yeah.\n>> The whole household is using it.\n\n1072\n00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:34,350\nSo who knows what the kids\nhave done to that machine and\n\n1073\n00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:35,970\nsometime the parents\nare worse than the kids.\n\n1074\n00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:39,780\nSo, but yet I'm supposed to allow this\ncomputer to connect to my network and\n\n1075\n00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:44,020\ngain access to resources, and\npotentially then infect my network.\n\n1076\n00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:47,350\nSo network access protection,\nthe network access control is\n\n1077\n00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:51,610\nthe platform independent term, is gonna\ngive me the ability to at least do some\n\n1078\n00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:56,120\nkind of check on those machines before\nI allow them to connect to my network.\n\n1079\n00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,991\nLet me at least go through the basics,\nlike in a Microsoft world with NAP,\n\n1080\n00:47:59,991 --> 00:48:02,625\nwe can check for\nWindows updates being turned on.\n\n1081\n00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:05,820\nWe can check for\nantivirus software, anti spyware,\n\n1082\n00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:09,300\nwhether the firewall is turned on,\nand things like that.\n\n1083\n00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,333\nAnd if they're not.\n\n1084\n00:48:10,333 --> 00:48:13,750\nIt runs a little script, and it sends\nback the response from the script.\n\n1085\n00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:18,471\nAnd if any of those are fail, I can choose\nto either not give them matches at all and\n\n1086\n00:48:18,471 --> 00:48:22,637\njust cut them off, or I could kick them\nout to a remediation portion of my\n\n1087\n00:48:22,637 --> 00:48:25,220\nnetwork, which goes back into our subnet.\n\n1088\n00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,030\nRight?\nIt's a portion of my network where I'm\n\n1089\n00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:30,470\ngonna allow them to go in and\nnot talk to anything else on my network.\n\n1090\n00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:33,490\nAll they get is they get\nlocked down into that portion.\n\n1091\n00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:37,224\nAnd maybe I run a WSUS server to allow\nthem to get their machine up to date.\n\n1092\n00:48:37,224 --> 00:48:39,766\nI can even have it turn\nthe firewall on for them.\n\n1093\n00:48:39,766 --> 00:48:40,347\n>> Right.\n\n1094\n00:48:40,347 --> 00:48:44,416\n>> Or maybe we have our corporate copy of\nour antivirus software on a server in that\n\n1095\n00:48:44,416 --> 00:48:45,960\nremediation network.\n\n1096\n00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,150\nThat they can install.\n\n1097\n00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:49,200\nAnd then once they can\npass the health check,\n\n1098\n00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,370\nI'll let them out of that remediation\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1099\n00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:53,330\n>> Portion and gain access to my network.\n\n1100\n00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,050\nBut it's just a way to try to\n\n1101\n00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:56,260\ncontrol the machines-\n>> Oh, yeah,\n\n1102\n00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,080\n>> That are being allowed,\n\n1103\n00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,410\nespecially now days cuz we're\nallowing all these different devices\n\n1104\n00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:04,840\nthat are maybe not under my domain\nwhere I can't use group policy\n\n1105\n00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,840\nto control them-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1106\n00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,720\n>> And to install software and\nto configure their firewall and\n\n1107\n00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,370\ntheir Windows updates and\nthings like that.\n\n1108\n00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:14,370\n>> Now it's really amazing about\nhow much we don't think about this.\n\n1109\n00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:19,650\nWe pretty much assume that people\nkeep their machines up to date and\n\n1110\n00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:20,770\nwe always assume that.\n\n1111\n00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:24,160\nAnd we always are proven wrong,\nespecially Mike.\n\n1112\n00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,690\nMike always get home and says, hey,\n\n1113\n00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:30,350\ncan you take a look at my computer and\ninevitably, we get proven wrong by this.\n\n1114\n00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:33,250\n>> You can barely see the desktop because\nof all the popups that are happening.\n\n1115\n00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:34,180\n>> All the toolbars.\n\n1116\n00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:34,740\n>> Yes.\n\n1117\n00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,640\nI mean their Internet Explorer window's\nonly about this big because it's got this\n\n1118\n00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,910\nmany toolbars.\n\n1119\n00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:40,210\nYou know, the Jimmony click-its.\n\n1120\n00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:41,940\nThe one's that just go next,\nnext, next, install.\n\n1121\n00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,060\nThey don't read anything.\n\n1122\n00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:43,860\nEverything's checked.\n\n1123\n00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:49,540\nYeah, it's crazy that some networks just\nallow those computers to connect and\n\n1124\n00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,160\ndon't bother checking.\n\n1125\n00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,020\n>> And sometimes this happens very easily.\n\n1126\n00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:55,760\nYou might wonder how in the heck\ndid they get infected then.\n\n1127\n00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,070\nWell, there's an example here for\nus in reality for what we do right here.\n\n1128\n00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:02,340\nThe very fact is,\nout in our break area that we have,\n\n1129\n00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:06,090\nthere's actually four network jacks that\nare out there that provide for access.\n\n1130\n00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,540\nSo that they can get\naccess to the Internet.\n\n1131\n00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:09,860\nSo if you wanted to bring your laptop in.\n\n1132\n00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,100\nYou could kind of plug up there and\nbe able to connect in.\n\n1133\n00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,160\nWell, we don't think about it.\n\n1134\n00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,780\nRight, and we have that connected into,\nlet's say one of our internal VLANs.\n\n1135\n00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,400\nWe don't.\nWe've already protected it.\n\n1136\n00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,660\nBut, if we did, that meant that that\nmachine that may have been infected could\n\n1137\n00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:26,090\nliterally plug into a network\nthat is now connected to others.\n\n1138\n00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:28,320\nAnd the infection can\ngo on from that point.\n\n1139\n00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,330\nSo if I take a look at it\nin terms of my defense and\n\n1140\n00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:32,970\ndepth, they've already\nbypassed my perimeter, right.\n\n1141\n00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:33,900\n>> Absolutely.\n>> They're in there.\n\n1142\n00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,280\n>> Exactly.\n>> They're physically in there.\n\n1143\n00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,030\n>> Exactly.\n>> Okay.\n\n1144\n00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:37,100\nThey've really bypassed network.\n\n1145\n00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,130\nI've already given them an IP address.\n\n1146\n00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,400\nSo they're there.\n\n1147\n00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,280\nSo what we're really taking a look\nat now is between that network and\n\n1148\n00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,410\nthat host layer of security.\n\n1149\n00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:46,720\n>> Right.\n>> So what we're saying is we want to\n\n1150\n00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,200\nprotect everything.\n\n1151\n00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,230\nWhether they're actually from\nthe outside or the inside here, and\n\n1152\n00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:54,370\nwhat we might choose to, and\nwe're not doing this right now,\n\n1153\n00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:56,880\nis that we might choose to use something\nlike network access protection.\n\n1154\n00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,460\n>> Right.\n\n1155\n00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:00,760\n>> If somebody plugs a device\ninto that port jack, right,\n\n1156\n00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,550\nwhat it does it automatically\nscans that device.\n\n1157\n00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:07,470\nSays yes I think everything's good and\nI'll give you a thumbs up for\n\n1158\n00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:08,780\nyou to get access in.\n\n1159\n00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:09,280\n>> Right.\n\n1160\n00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,370\n>> Or, I don't think so.\n\n1161\n00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:12,280\nWe're gonna send you off to that\nremediation, in other words,\n\n1162\n00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,900\nwe're gonna put you in that different\nsubnet until you meet the requirements.\n\n1163\n00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,790\nA lot of times there's policies involved.\n\n1164\n00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:19,990\nWe'll talk about policies\na little bit later on, but\n\n1165\n00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:21,700\nthere's a lot of different things here.\n\n1166\n00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:27,050\nBut should that be something that we only\nthink about when something bad happens?\n\n1167\n00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:27,550\n>> Right.\n>> No.\n\n1168\n00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:28,120\n>> Too late then?\n\n1169\n00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,540\n>> We should be thinking about it, yeah,\n\n1170\n00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:33,270\nduring our design element,\nwhen we are actually doing this.\n\n1171\n00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:37,050\nThat hey, here's something that we want\nto consider, even if I don't do anything.\n\n1172\n00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:40,130\nI want to consider it because I do\nhave a lot of people coming in and\n\n1173\n00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:43,185\nthey're plugging into every\nnetwork that they can find.\n\n1174\n00:51:43,185 --> 00:51:44,630\n[LAUGH]\n>> I was just thinking about some,\n\n1175\n00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:46,400\nI know you've seen this situation too.\n\n1176\n00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,080\nYou have somebody that,\nthey bring their computer in.\n\n1177\n00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,750\nAnd they have their friend who's like,\nhey, can you, you're an IT guy.\n\n1178\n00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:53,920\nCan you look at my computer?\n\n1179\n00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,150\nCuz I think it's infected.\n\n1180\n00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,320\nAnd what do they do?\n\n1181\n00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,550\nThey open it up and\nplug it into their own network.\n\n1182\n00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,110\nI'm like, wait, what?\n\n1183\n00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:02,290\n>> Did you really just do that?\n\n1184\n00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,550\n>> So that's the kind of thing\nwe have got to try to prevent.\n\n1185\n00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,780\nAnd that's hopefully what all these\ndifferent layers are gonna do.\n\n1186\n00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,260\n>> Yeah and that's what we're hoping that\nnetwork access does is that if someone\n\n1187\n00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:14,270\ninadvertently plugs something in and\nthat we don't have a protection for.\n\n1188\n00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:17,930\nSo it really does help especially in\nthat situation where you have a lot of\n\n1189\n00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,030\npeople coming in.\n\n1190\n00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:22,780\nBut then again even your private users,\nlet's say you do send out a sales force\n\n1191\n00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,660\nand they are out they're on the road for\nsix weeks.\n\n1192\n00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:26,740\nThey bring their devices\nto different networks,\n\n1193\n00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,430\nhotel networks,\nother business networks, you name it.\n\n1194\n00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:31,150\nAnd they come back and\nthey plug this thing directly in.\n\n1195\n00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:33,590\n>> Who knows what they're,\nI always say that desktops,\n\n1196\n00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:36,290\nyou're in an environment where\nI can control that, right.\n\n1197\n00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:39,690\nMy users don't take their desktops home,\nI've got group policy and\n\n1198\n00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,840\nother things in place that\nare keeping them safe and\n\n1199\n00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,340\nall my layers of defense, but\nthose laptops and other devices,\n\n1200\n00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:48,970\nthey're leaving my trusted environment and\nthey're visiting strange networks.\n\n1201\n00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:49,990\nAnd they can pick something up.\n\n1202\n00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:52,450\nAnd then they're just gonna bring\nthat right back into your network or\n\n1203\n00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:55,870\nthey're going to make that remote access\nconnection and infect you remotely.\n\n1204\n00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:56,650\n>> Yeah.\n\n1205\n00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:58,460\n>> So we've got to kind of control or\n\n1206\n00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:02,610\nbe able to prevent that type\n>> Definitely, yeah.\n\n1207\n00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:05,820\nAll right, we have a little bit more\non the idea of moving towards the inner\n\n1208\n00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:08,600\nlayers of that defensive depth here.\n\n1209\n00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,240\nBut once again Mike, it looks like\nyou've talked too long this time.\n\n1210\n00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,170\n>> Wow. [LAUGH] >> I'm joking, it was me.\n\n1211\n00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:12,720\nIt was me.\n\n1212\n00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,440\nMy fault.\nAnd so what we're going to do is we're\n\n1213\n00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,020\ngoing to take a break, and\nwe will be right back to continue on here.\n\n1214\n00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,305\nSo join us after the break.\n\n1215\n00:53:21,305 --> 00:53:29,077\n[SOUND].\n\n1216\n00:53:29,077 --> 00:53:29,635\nAll right.\n\n1217\n00:53:29,635 --> 00:53:33,090\nWelcome back, for our next segment here,\nas we continue on.\n\n1218\n00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:36,480\nWe have just really finished talking about\nthe idea of network access protection for\n\n1219\n00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,030\nus, and we are now moving on\nin the host security, as well.\n\n1220\n00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:44,578\nI want to talk briefly\nabout the use of telephony.\n\n1221\n00:53:44,578 --> 00:53:45,148\nOkay [CROSSTALK].\n\n1222\n00:53:45,148 --> 00:53:48,331\n>> Before we get into it,\nlet's grab that question out.\n\n1223\n00:53:48,331 --> 00:53:52,210\nMike just asked what's\nthe difference between 301 and 401.\n\n1224\n00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:57,000\nAbout 100 [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, Mike and his witty humor.\n\n1225\n00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,200\n>> I know, I'm just so darn funny.\n\n1226\n00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,820\nWe did cover that at the beginning,\nI think, of this episode so\n\n1227\n00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:04,944\nyou always can check back with there,\nbut this is the new version, right?\n\n1228\n00:54:04,944 --> 00:54:06,834\nNow CompTIA's updated their objectives so\n\n1229\n00:54:06,834 --> 00:54:09,090\nthe objectives are gonna\nbe a little bit different.\n\n1230\n00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:11,850\nIf you've been studying for\nthe 301, we've talked about it.\n\n1231\n00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:14,320\nEverything you've learned in\nthere is gonna transfer over.\n\n1232\n00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,330\nThere might be a couple new\nobjectives here and there.\n\n1233\n00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:19,670\nA couple new points which is why we're\ndoing these episodes all over again.\n\n1234\n00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:21,880\nBut the best thing to do\nis get on the website or\n\n1235\n00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:25,850\nget on our website, grab that objective\nlist and just go down through it.\n\n1236\n00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:27,320\nAnd if you've already been studying for\n\n1237\n00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,980\nthe 301, then you should be\nable to check most of them off.\n\n1238\n00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:32,400\nAnd then you'll see what's left and\nyou can just come back and\n\n1239\n00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,680\npick up the episode where we cover\nsome of those newer topics probably.\n\n1240\n00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,120\n>> A lot of the newer topics actually\ndo revolve around the idea here\n\n1241\n00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,090\nof the bring your own device.\n\n1242\n00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:41,790\n>> Right.\n\n1243\n00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:44,550\n>> Man, the mobility and stuff like that.\n\n1244\n00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:46,330\nSo do stay tuned for those episodes.\n\n1245\n00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:48,690\nCuz those are actually going\nto be really concentrated,\n\n1246\n00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:51,070\nin those things that we'll\nactually end up doing.\n\n1247\n00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:53,275\nBut that's what you'll actually end\nup seeing, Mike, a lot of times.\n\n1248\n00:54:53,275 --> 00:54:54,095\n>> Yeah, exactly, Mike.\n\n1249\n00:54:54,095 --> 00:54:56,975\nI think we're all kind of going through\nthe same thing where these certificates\n\n1250\n00:54:56,975 --> 00:54:59,295\nare, what used to be lifetime\ncerts are getting expired.\n\n1251\n00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:01,975\nAnd it is good, I mean it's a pain for\neverybody, I know.\n\n1252\n00:55:01,975 --> 00:55:04,365\nIt's another exam you gotta take,\nit's money.\n\n1253\n00:55:04,365 --> 00:55:06,210\nHey, maybe work will pay for it, you know?\n\n1254\n00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:07,190\nBut, if you're looking for\n\n1255\n00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:11,570\na job or you're changing careers, it's\none of things you get complacent, right?\n\n1256\n00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:13,550\nYou've been working for\nthis company eight or nine years,\n\n1257\n00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:15,820\nyou got your certs when\nyou first got the job and\n\n1258\n00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:18,780\nyou haven't updated them, because you've\ngot a job, and you're okay with that.\n\n1259\n00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,440\nBut now when you go to\nput out your resume, and\n\n1260\n00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,700\nyou're like, I'm A+ certified, 2003.\n\n1261\n00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,210\nOr I'm certified in server, 2003.\n\n1262\n00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:31,930\nSo having that latest certification\njust makes you more valuable out there.\n\n1263\n00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:36,820\nIt's good to keep all your information up\nto date, especially as security changes so\n\n1264\n00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:38,220\nmuch, as Ronnie was saying.\n\n1265\n00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,220\nNew types of access that we're providing.\n\n1266\n00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:43,580\nLetting people just bring in any old\ndevice and hook it up to our network.\n\n1267\n00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:44,170\n>> Yeah.\n\n1268\n00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:46,240\n>> So for sure, for sure,\nglad to have you here, Mike.\n\n1269\n00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,190\n>> Yep, glad to have you here.\n\n1270\n00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,780\nAnd again, stay tuned for these episodes.\n\n1271\n00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,580\nWe'll be covering all of\nthe differences here.\n\n1272\n00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:54,020\nBut again, you'll probably see most of\nit is around that idea of mobility and,\n\n1273\n00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:59,400\nof course, the bring-your-own-device stuff\nis just killing us a lot like crazy.\n\n1274\n00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,125\nOkay?\n\n1275\n00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:05,500\nWe were really finishing up again, network\naccess control, is what we were doing.\n\n1276\n00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,063\nAnd we want to talk a little bit, and\n\n1277\n00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:09,410\nwe're going to take a look\nat the idea of telephony and\n\n1278\n00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:13,080\nvirtualization in this bigger section,\nis what we want to talk about here, okay?\n\n1279\n00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:13,900\n>> We still use phones?\n\n1280\n00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:18,950\n>> We still at times need to use phones,\nand we love our telephones, and without\n\n1281\n00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:23,920\nthem we wouldn't have our business, so we\nlove the idea of telephony for us, here.\n\n1282\n00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,360\nBut this has changed over time.\n\n1283\n00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:26,370\nRight?\n>> It has, hasn't it.\n\n1284\n00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:27,216\nYeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1285\n00:56:27,216 --> 00:56:28,640\n[LAUGH]\n>> I mean,\n\n1286\n00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,900\nbig difference from what we used\nto have for telephone networks.\n\n1287\n00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,000\nNow our telephone networks and\n\n1288\n00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,710\nour data networks are just kind of\nblending in the lines of processing.\n\n1289\n00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:38,030\n>> That's it.\n>> It's hard to separate them out anymore.\n\n1290\n00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:38,610\n>> Yeah.\n\n1291\n00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:39,470\nYeah, at one time, right,\n\n1292\n00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:42,580\nthe telephone system essentially\nwas the backbone of every business.\n\n1293\n00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,050\nAnd today, the concept of it is\n>> But\n\n1294\n00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:48,000\nthe way that we do telephony today is not.\n\n1295\n00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,210\nSo what we tend to do today, is we\nactually use something we call like VOIP,\n\n1296\n00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:52,530\nas an example here.\n\n1297\n00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:55,910\nOur Voice Over our IP networks\nwhich means we're merging\n\n1298\n00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:59,190\nthe telephony component over\nour data networks here.\n\n1299\n00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:03,020\nThat means data and voice essentially\nare using the same wires here.\n\n1300\n00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,780\n>> Right.\n>> Mike, I see a potential problem.\n\n1301\n00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:06,770\n>> Well, there's a few of them,\naren't there, right?\n\n1302\n00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:08,400\nFirst and foremost, it's just congestion.\n\n1303\n00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:08,970\n>> That's it.\n\n1304\n00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:09,470\nRight.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1305\n00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:10,760\nAll of a sudden because, you guys know,\n\n1306\n00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,340\nwith voice and video packets,\n\n1307\n00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:15,725\nthese have to arrive in a timely\nfashion in the right order.\n\n1308\n00:57:15,725 --> 00:57:19,090\nOr it becomes hard to understand what\nthe person is saying on the other end.\n\n1309\n00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:21,420\nSo, but\nnow my data is on that same network.\n\n1310\n00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,710\nSo people are moving large files\naround and things like that,\n\n1311\n00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:24,830\nand they've got to compete.\n\n1312\n00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:28,720\nSo we've have to do, like,\nquality of service to control that.\n\n1313\n00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,620\nAnd then the second problem is,\nnow that we've put our voice, or\n\n1314\n00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:36,610\nour telephone,\non our data network, that means,\n\n1315\n00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:41,050\nany vulnerabilities that my data network\nhas, now also applies to my phone network.\n\n1316\n00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:41,550\n>> Yeah.\n\n1317\n00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:43,210\nAnd the other way around too, right.\n\n1318\n00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,720\nRemember that there used to be,\nin my time,\n\n1319\n00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,490\nremind you of an old term,\nfreakers, right.\n\n1320\n00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:48,710\nThe phone hackers that were out there.\n\n1321\n00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:53,340\nAgain, those things still apply, not so\nmuch in the PBX system, but because now\n\n1322\n00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:57,480\nour voice is now merging together on that,\nwe have to make sure that if we're gonna\n\n1323\n00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:03,580\nbe implementing this technology, we've got\nto provide security for those things too.\n\n1324\n00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:08,110\nNow a lot of times when we think about\nright, what actually makes up the idea\n\n1325\n00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:11,610\nof the telephony,\nwhat we need in a telephony server right?\n\n1326\n00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:13,320\nSo we need some type of VOIP server.\n\n1327\n00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:17,220\nWe of course need some access to\nthat VLAN that we're gonna have.\n\n1328\n00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,660\nBut the devices themselves.\n\n1329\n00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:22,260\nSo we want to make sure that we do\nimplement the idea of design security on\n\n1330\n00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,300\nevery single layer.\n\n1331\n00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,780\nNow, you're probably saying Ronnie,\n\n1332\n00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,650\nthere's some many different\nthings we've talked about so far,\n\n1333\n00:58:27,650 --> 00:58:31,460\nhow do you know how to actually or\nwhen to actually do stuff like this?\n\n1334\n00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,430\nWell, let me tell you something.\n\n1335\n00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:35,360\nThere's a perfectly good\nresource out there, that you're\n\n1336\n00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,640\nnot gonna really want to go to, and that's\nbecause we don't trust them anymore.\n\n1337\n00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,800\n>> Oh.\n>> The NSA.\n\n1338\n00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,240\nYou know, I hate to say it but it's true.\n\n1339\n00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,005\n>> Hey, if anybody knows\nabout tapping phone lines.\n\n1340\n00:58:44,005 --> 00:58:44,780\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, they know\n\n1341\n00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:45,852\nabout tapping phone lines.\n\n1342\n00:58:45,852 --> 00:58:47,500\n[LAUGH]\n>> Or listening where you go.\n\n1343\n00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,790\n>> Anything.\nYou know, it doesn't

phone just buzzed.\n\n1347\n00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:52,270\nI think they're watching right now.\n\n1348\n00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:53,445\n>> There you go.\nIt's possible.\n\n1349\n00:58:53,445 --> 00:58:55,000\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's very possible\n\n1350\n00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000\nthat they're doing it.\n\n1351\n00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,244\nBut I want to actually\npoint out something,\n\n1352\n00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:02,442\ncuz I thought this was actually a neat,\nmaybe I didn't actually bring it up here.\n\n1353\n00:59:02,442 --> 00:59:04,301\nI thought I did.\n\n1354\n00:59:04,301 --> 00:59:05,847\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> While he's pulling it up,\n\n1355\n00:59:05,847 --> 00:59:09,423\nthis goes right back to what we\ntalked about in our first segment of\n\n1356\n00:59:09,423 --> 00:59:10,358\nthis episode.\n\n1357\n00:59:10,358 --> 00:59:11,980\nBy segregating\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1358\n00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,200\n>> We can segregate out

traffic.\n\n1361\n00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,717\nYou know like I said it's susceptible to\nthe same type we can if I can go to denial\n\n1362\n00:59:23,717 --> 00:59:26,680\nof service on your network\n>> Not only can I stop your data transfer\n\n1363\n00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,250\nnow, but I can stop your voice and\nthings like that.\n\n1364\n00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:34,035\nOr I could try to gain access to\nsomebody's mail box, their voice mail.\n\n1365\n00:59:34,035 --> 00:59:34,850\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1366\n00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:36,120\n>> Or change their voice mail.\n\n1367\n00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,140\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or erase their messages.\n\n1368\n00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:38,930\n>> Yeah.\n\n1369\n00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:44,395\n>> So there's all kinds of attacks that\nby putting our phone on our data network.\n\n1370\n00:59:44,395 --> 00:59:46,660\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That we are now exposing ourselves to.\n\n1371\n00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:47,530\nAnd we might not think about it.\n\n1372\n00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:48,760\nAll right.\nWe're just like it's so\n\n1373\n00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,680\ncool, I can do away with these phone\nlines because now I've got voice over IP.\n\n1374\n00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,640\nGreat.\n\n1375\n00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,690\nYeah, but we didn't think about now\nall the new vulnerabilities, so\n\n1376\n00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:59,230\nit means going back and looking at it\nfrom the ground-up all over again.\n\n1377\n00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:01,210\nAnd trying to figure out\nhow we can keep it safe.\n\n1378\n01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:05,320\n>> Yeah, there's a lot of places, like we\nsaid in terms of keeping it safe here.\n\n1379\n01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,970\nBut knowing about what we need to do\nin terms of just really general design,\n\n1380\n01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:11,950\none of the most eye-opening articles and\n\n1381\n01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:14,580\nactually gives you a good feel of it,\nis actually from the NSA.\n\n1382\n01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:18,210\nAnd you can see, NSA.gov right here,\nand there it is.\n\n1383\n01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:22,630\nThe Security Guidance for\nDeploying IP Telephony Systems.\n\n1384\n01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:23,410\nNow it's a bit dated-\n>> Wait,\n\n1385\n01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:26,010\ndid I just see a command prompt open and\nclose on your window?\n\n1386\n01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:27,340\n>> Yes you did.\nYou probably did, yeah, yeah.\n\n1387\n01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:29,230\nSo it's a little bit dated, but\n\n1388\n01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:32,850\nthe concepts in terms of\ndesign are really good.\n\n1389\n01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:35,160\nSo, even if you don't trust them,\n\n1390\n01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:38,750\ntake a look at their archives in terms\nof some of the designs, and you'll see.\n\n1391\n01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,010\nActually, this one's very well written.\n\n1392\n01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:46,680\nI was very pleased that it wasn't actually\nin the technicalese, the technic,\n\n1393\n01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:51,460\nwhatever language that just kind\nof overwhelms you at times, but\n\n1394\n01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:54,300\nit's worth you taking a look at in\nterms of some of the design elements.\n\n1395\n01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:57,430\nCuz I think about the idea\nof protecting telephony.\n\n1396\n01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:59,150\nI'm like, it's a telephone call who cares.\n\n1397\n01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:02,770\nWell you could be sharing credit\ncard information over it,\n\n1398\n01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:04,790\nyou could be sharing account information.\n\n1399\n01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:08,740\nAgain, if anybody can actually hack\na regular phone system, I mean a regular\n\n1400\n01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:13,500\ncomputer today in the telephony\nnetworks is fairly not easy as well and\n\n1401\n01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:17,280\nsome of these new phones have these other\nfeatures besides what you're imagining.\n\n1402\n01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,080\nSome of them,\nMike even in our business right?\n\n1403\n01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,233\nThey have an actual web server on them.\n\n1404\n01:01:21,233 --> 01:01:21,810\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1405\n01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:25,310\nWell if you could hack a web server,\nyou can hack that device.\n\n1406\n01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:27,280\nAnd so\nyou gotta be careful on some of this stuff\n\n1407\n01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,640\n>> And a lot of times your users you know,\n\n1408\n01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,520\nthey don't think about and\nthey're on the phone so\n\n1409\n01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,940\nthey're not even thinking about...\n\n1410\n01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:36,030\nHow me talking to this other,\nI'm calling Bob down in sales and\n\n1411\n01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:39,240\nI'm asking him about account number 4543\nand I don't think about the fact that I'm\n\n1412\n01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,730\nnow sending sensitive information\nover that phone conversation.\n\n1413\n01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:45,100\nWhen there's a phone line,\nI wasn't too worried about it.\n\n1414\n01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,470\nBut now that's being transmitted across my\nnetwork and anyone that has access to that\n\n1415\n01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:51,830\nnetwork can potentially gain\naccess to that information.\n\n1416\n01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:54,740\nYeah, telephony is a big part and you're\nnot gonna get away from this, right?\n\n1417\n01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:57,110\nIn any production network,\nI don't care what you do,\n\n1418\n01:01:57,110 --> 01:02:02,430\nyou're gonna have phone sets that you have\nto deal with in terms of securing them.\n\n1419\n01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:06,160\nA lot of times, they the software\nrunning directly on the computer, and\n\n1420\n01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,220\nthere's even a special term a lot of\nthe times you might hear about the.\n\n1421\n01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:12,560\nThe computer integrated telephony,\nor computer-telephony integration,\n\n1422\n01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,150\nor whatever it might be.\n\n1423\n01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:16,400\nWhich is essentially a whole system here.\n\n1424\n01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,130\nAll that has to be secured.\n\n1425\n01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:21,060\nAnd if you're going to be running IP\nphones, you've got to worry about it.\n\n1426\n01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:21,750\nWe run IP phones.\n\n1427\n01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:25,180\nAnd I guarantee you, you want to know\nthe system that's attacked the most?\n\n1428\n01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:25,990\nIt's that system.\n\n1429\n01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:26,690\n>> Phone system, yeah.\n\n1430\n01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:30,650\n>> It is constantly ringing\nsome device in our network.\n\n1431\n01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:32,400\nVOIP attacks are happening like crazy.\n\n1432\n01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,230\n>> Cuz the bad guys know\nwe're not as experienced.\n\n1433\n01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:38,830\nIt's relatively newer, and\nthere's not as much time, I think,\n\n1434\n01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:40,740\nspent securing that sometimes.\n\n1435\n01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:41,460\n>> Yeah.\n>> And that\n\n1436\n01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,030\nwe're not monitoring as closely, maybe.\n\n1437\n01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:43,800\nSo they know.\n\n1438\n01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:46,260\nThey're not stupid, so\nthat's what they're hitting.\n\n1439\n01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:46,760\nYeah.\n\n1440\n01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,490\nSo a lot of times when you start\nseeing stuff like this, you've gotta,\n\n1441\n01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:52,760\nagain, be aware that telephony is\ngonna be a big part of the network.\n\n1442\n01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,770\nIn a regular phone system\nyou're probably not so\n\n1443\n01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:58,830\nworried about this connecting out to your\nphysical land switch, but most of us,\n\n1444\n01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:01,710\nwe're doing VOIP,\nwe have to worry about this as well.\n\n1445\n01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:04,900\nSame security as doing a thing\nabout implementing on a PBX system,\n\n1446\n01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,570\nyou've got to also think about here, but\n\n1447\n01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:09,720\nalso you have to think about your\ndata network protection as well.\n\n1448\n01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:10,280\n>> Exactly.\n\n1449\n01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,680\n>> So that's a big part of it too.\n\n1450\n01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:15,800\nSo we want to make sure that we\nemphasize that in terms of our design.\n\n1451\n01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,720\nNow, the next thing that\nreally affects our design,\n\n1452\n01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,790\nthere's no real particular\npreferential order that we have,\n\n1453\n01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:25,430\nit's just the way that we chose to do\nthis, is the use of virtualization.\n\n1454\n01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:28,490\nNow it's been around for\na long time for us now.\n\n1455\n01:03:28,490 --> 01:03:30,590\nYou know, probably five or six years.\n\n1456\n01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:33,790\nBut it is only getting more and\nmore popular, okay?\n\n1457\n01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:34,430\nAnd so for\n\n1458\n01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:39,330\nus, we've got to also think about the idea\nof protection in terms of virtualization.\n\n1459\n01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:40,130\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1460\n01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:43,270\nCuz now all of a sudden you've got,\nit's as Ronnie said,\n\n1461\n01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:46,680\nvery common because we've got these\nservers that are just incredibly powerful,\n\n1462\n01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:49,420\nyou know quad cores and\nso on and so forth.\n\n1463\n01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:50,640\nHuge amounts of memory.\n\n1464\n01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,780\nI can't just run DNS on it.\n\n1465\n01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:54,040\nI mean I'm not going to\nutilize my resources properly.\n\n1466\n01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,083\nSo we virtualize.\n\n1467\n01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:57,662\nBut now all of a sudden I've got five,\n\n1468\n01:03:57,662 --> 01:04:01,458\nten virtual servers running\non that one physical host.\n\n1469\n01:04:01,458 --> 01:04:03,058\nCompromise that host,\n\n1470\n01:04:03,058 --> 01:04:07,600\nI can potentially compromise ten\nservers instead of just one.\n\n1471\n01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,610\n>> Yeah.\nSo we just do a basic explanation\n\n1472\n01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:12,940\nof virtualization here, just in case you\nhaven't encountered this before, right?\n\n1473\n01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:14,422\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> A regular computer for us,\n\n1474\n01:04:14,422 --> 01:04:17,220\nright, is one that we have up here,\nwhat I call non-virtualized.\n\n1475\n01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:17,860\n>> Right.\nIf hardware-\n\n1476\n01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:18,610\n>> Standard desktop.\n\n1477\n01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:19,790\n>> Standard desktop.\n\n1478\n01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:22,750\nWe run an operating system on top of it,\nand then we run the application.\n\n1479\n01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:24,250\nRight?\nWell, that's something that you and\n\n1480\n01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:25,540\nI are actually familiar with.\n\n1481\n01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:27,400\nWe haven't been in any\nproduction network at all.\n\n1482\n01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:27,910\n>> Right.\n\n1483\n01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:32,060\n>> But there are some environments which\nare actually one of these two down here.\n\n1484\n01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:32,910\nAnd a lot of times,\n\n1485\n01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:35,594\nthis one over here on the left hand\nside is more of a testing environment.\n\n1486\n01:04:35,594 --> 01:04:37,650\nRight.\nThe right hand side over here more of\n\n1487\n01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:39,058\na production environment.\n\n1488\n01:04:39,058 --> 01:04:42,940\nAnd what Mikel is describing is what\nwe actually tend to see over here on\n\n1489\n01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:48,755\nthe right hand side, in which we literally\non one physical piece of hardware.\n\n1490\n01:04:48,755 --> 01:04:49,360\nMm-hm.\n\n1491\n01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,900\nWe can actually be running\nmultiple operating systems.\n\n1492\n01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,920\nI know you love my hand drawings there.\n\n1493\n01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,170\n>> I do, pretty good there.\n\n1494\n01:04:56,170 --> 01:04:57,610\n>> At the same time, so\n\n1495\n01:04:57,610 --> 01:05:00,300\nsimultaneously being able to\nrun multiple operating systems.\n\n1496\n01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:03,580\nNow Mike can set up a DNS\nserver all by it's self.\n\n1497\n01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:04,615\nRight.\n>> Even on the same hardware.\n\n1498\n01:05:04,615 --> 01:05:07,180\nMm-hm.\nAs he does the other things that he might\n\n1499\n01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:11,220\nwant to implement, and they're seen\nas physically separate machines here.\n\n1500\n01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,650\n>> So you can run applications\nthat aren't compatible,\n\n1501\n01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:18,773\ntwo versions of the same application\n>> Yeah, we've done in other episodes,\n\n1502\n01:05:18,773 --> 01:05:22,590\nthere's many advantages of doing\nthe virtualization, but it does expose us.\n\n1503\n01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:26,400\nAgain, any time we change the way we're\ndoing things, we've gotta go back and\n\n1504\n01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,210\nlook at our security.\n\n1505\n01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:30,830\nWe've gotta reevaluate what\nthe vulnerabilities are.\n\n1506\n01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:34,480\nBecause now I've gotta stop and think,\nokay, what have I exposed myself to?\n\n1507\n01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,080\nWhat are my risks here?\n\n1508\n01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,070\nAnd then how am I going to\nprotect myself from that?\n\n1509\n01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:40,971\nCuz somebody could potentially jump\nfrom one virtual machine to the other\n\n1510\n01:05:40,971 --> 01:05:41,540\nin this case.\n\n1511\n01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:43,445\nUh-huh.\nOr like you said, compromise the host and\n\n1512\n01:05:43,445 --> 01:05:45,170\ngain access to all those virtual machines.\n\n1513\n01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:45,870\n>> That's it.\nYeah.\n\n1514\n01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:49,880\nSo in this element in terms of design and\nthe idea of security here okay.\n\n1515\n01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,930\nWe not only have to implement\nthe idea of security on\n\n1516\n01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:57,231\neach one of these machines here,\nbut as well as on the host itself.\n\n1517\n01:05:57,231 --> 01:05:58,140\nMm-hm.\nIn other words,\n\n1518\n01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:01,880\nwhat's actually underlying all these\nvirtual machines that are running.\n\n1519\n01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:04,720\nA lot of times we think about protecting\nthe individual virtual machines,\n\n1520\n01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,120\nmaking sure they're updated,\nrunning anti virus.\n\n1521\n01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:10,905\nSame time on the host itself, we have\nto think about updating these things.\n\n1522\n01:06:10,905 --> 01:06:13,640\nUh-huh.\nOr we leave that door open to now where\n\n1523\n01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:17,770\nthey have access to every virtual machine\nthat's running on that particular network.\n\n1524\n01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:18,630\n>> Exactly.\n>> And that's something\n\n1525\n01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:21,510\nwe cannot afford to do in\na production environment.\n\n1526\n01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:24,620\nThat is something that we've really\ngot to be aware of here, okay?\n\n1527\n01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:28,700\nNow, you might go okay, well, I can\nthat on my own network, but Mike, why in\n\n1528\n01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:31,690\nthe world would I care about one virtual\nmachine accessing another one here?\n\n1529\n01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:34,850\nA lot of time it actually\ngoes into something else.\n\n1530\n01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:38,250\nWhen we connect out to server that\nare actually out there on the internet,\n\n1531\n01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,270\na lot of times they're virtualized, right?\n\n1532\n01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:42,960\nAnd believe it or not, and I hope this\ndoesn't really happen, but it can,\n\n1533\n01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,435\nthe very fact is your\ncompetitors virtual machine.\n\n1534\n01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:47,500\nUh-huh.\nCould literally\n\n1535\n01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,230\nbe running right beside yours.\n\n1536\n01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:50,020\n>> Right, yeah.\n\n1537\n01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:51,180\nIf you're using the same provider.\n\n1538\n01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,720\nAnd you may be using the same exact\nprovider even though you're actually\n\n1539\n01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,710\ncompetitors here.\n\n1540\n01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:55,700\nI don't think they took a look at,\n\n1541\n01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:58,720\nokay your machine's gonna be on this one,\nthis guy's gonna be on the other one.\n\n1542\n01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,300\nThey could literally be\non that same machine,\n\n1543\n01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:04,150\nand there is the ability at sometime.\n\n1544\n01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:06,575\nIt could be where they might be able\nto figure it out, I'm not sure how.\n\n1545\n01:07:06,575 --> 01:07:08,580\nRight.\nBut it could figure it out and\n\n1546\n01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:10,660\nmaybe better access yours.\n\n1547\n01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:12,150\nNot that we've seen so far.\n\n1548\n01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:15,440\nTheoretically possible, and\nI'm pretty sure somebody's working it out.\n\n1549\n01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,290\nThe very fact is we have to think\nabout the idea of protection.and\n\n1550\n01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:19,430\n>> It's a lot about the provider.\n\n1551\n01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:20,560\nDo you trust that person?\n\n1552\n01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:25,460\nBecause if you are using cloud services\nand things like that, like Ronnie says,\n\n1553\n01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:30,160\nyou're probably not, they're giving\nyou a slice of one of their machines.\n\n1554\n01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,140\nAnd you have no idea of the other machine.\n\n1555\n01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:35,700\nNow if you've got enough money you could\nsay all right I wanna be off by myself.\n\n1556\n01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:39,070\nBut in most situations we're using\nshared resources out there, and so\n\n1557\n01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:41,130\nwe gotta hope that they're\ndoing their job and\n\n1558\n01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:43,630\ncontrolling the access from\none machine to another.\n\n1559\n01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:47,050\nThat the employees that work for\nthis company are trustworthy, and\n\n1560\n01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:50,470\nnot getting paid by the competition\nto give them access to our machines.\n\n1561\n01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:54,106\nThere a lot of things that opens up\na whole new set of vulnerabilities.\n\n1562\n01:07:54,106 --> 01:07:55,150\nYeah.\nAnd so for\n\n1563\n01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:58,689\nthose of us that have been in the\nnetworking business for a while, right?\n\n1564\n01:07:58,689 --> 01:08:03,460\nAnd Mike and I can remember this, when we\nhad a rack of 10 different servers, and\n\n1565\n01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:07,520\nyou would just put one machine and\none server roll on them.\n\n1566\n01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:11,590\nBut then the idea of virtualization allows\nus to optimize the use of hardware.\n\n1567\n01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:14,160\nBetter hardware today, stronger machines.\n\n1568\n01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,610\nOne of our servers today\nprobably equals like ten or\n\n1569\n01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:18,500\n12 of those servers that we used to use.\n\n1570\n01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,610\n>> I think we went from, what, ten or 12?\n\n1571\n01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:22,220\n>> Three.\n>> Physical to three.\n\n1572\n01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:23,350\nThree machines.\n\n1573\n01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:26,620\nThe three little, not O power supplies,\nbut yeah, it's a big difference,\n\n1574\n01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:27,180\nit's a big difference.\n\n1575\n01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:30,530\nBut like I said, it does give, and\nit changes the vulnerabilities and\n\n1576\n01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:32,290\nthe way we manage and secure our network.\n\n1577\n01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:32,840\n>> Yeah.\n\n1578\n01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,200\nYou know, one of the vulnerabilities\nthat we faced right off,\n\n1579\n01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:38,760\nwhich again, comes from inexperience\nlike myself at times here.\n\n1580\n01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:41,000\nWell, we ran everything virtualized, and\n\n1581\n01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,360\nthen we had a power\nfailure on our network.\n\n1582\n01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,859\nAnd what did we realize.\n\n1583\n01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:49,777\nWell the main authentication server,\nwe couldn't get access to back then, too,\n\n1584\n01:08:49,777 --> 01:08:50,980\nbecause it was off!\n\n1585\n01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,800\n[LAUGH]\n>> If the host machine that's hosting\n\n1586\n01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:56,490\nthe virtual machines is part of domain,\nit needs to talk to the domain controller,\n\n1587\n01:08:56,490 --> 01:09:00,180\nwhich isn't on, because it's\na virtual machine on the host switch\n\n1588\n01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:01,460\n>> Yeah, so\n\n1589\n01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:04,960\nI mean there is other considerations out\nthere, but just kinda realise that you do\n\n1590\n01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,390\nhave to consider this is a huge part of\nany network design and virtualization.\n\n1591\n01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:13,870\nWhether you are running in on VMware or\ncentric sensor or Hyper V.\n\n1592\n01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:17,310\nThese are kind of the main three,\nthere is probably other ones out there.\n\n1593\n01:09:17,310 --> 01:09:20,870\n>> But all those you have to consider\nin terms of securing that as well.\n\n1594\n01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:24,590\n>> Absolutely as a bad guy we're gonna\ntalk all about different types of attacks,\n\n1595\n01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:26,895\nand one of them is gonna be\na denial of service attack.\n\n1596\n01:09:26,895 --> 01:09:29,790\nAnd it used to be,\nI could launch a denial of service attack,\n\n1597\n01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:33,037\nagainst that physical machine and\nI could shut it down.\n\n1598\n01:09:33,037 --> 01:09:33,940\n>> Mm hm\n>> Now\n\n1599\n01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:35,890\nif I do a physical attack\nagainst that machine,\n\n1600\n01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:38,076\nI just brought down 10 of your servers\n>> Mm hm\n\n1601\n01:09:38,076 --> 01:09:39,340\n>> Right, so that's you know again,\n\n1602\n01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:42,420\nsome of the things that\nthe virtualization brings in.\n\n1603\n01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:47,300\nSo I think that, we went through all\nour different layers here, didn't we?\n\n1604\n01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:48,230\n>> Yep, just about.\n\n1605\n01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:52,210\nThere are a couple I want to throw in\nbefore we wrap this little segment up.\n\n1606\n01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:53,980\nPull up your little drawing again there.\n\n1607\n01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:56,940\nHe's got this beautiful drawing,\nyou guys have been looking at it.\n\n1608\n01:09:56,940 --> 01:10:00,930\nYeah, one of the things I want to point\nout that we don't have on the drawing, and\n\n1609\n01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,020\nis a very important part.\n\n1610\n01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:04,800\nAnd usually most of the books that you\nsee, you're going to put this kind\n\n1611\n01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,650\nof underneath what Roddy's got here for\nour circle.\n\n1612\n01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:09,330\nWhen we talk about layers of defense,\n\n1613\n01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,250\na couple of things we don't\nwant to forget about.\n\n1614\n01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:15,210\nThe first and foremost is going to be\nsecurity awareness and user education.\n\n1615\n01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:15,990\nAll right?\n\n1616\n01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:17,150\nThey don't sound exciting.\n\n1617\n01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:18,930\nNot nearly as fun, maybe.\n\n1618\n01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:22,510\nIT people tend to overlook it a little\nbit, because it's not computer-related.\n\n1619\n01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:25,930\nIt's not a device I can configure,\nand things like that.\n\n1620\n01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:29,610\nBut everybody is a part of security,\nnot just the security peeps,\n\n1621\n01:10:29,610 --> 01:10:30,920\nnot just the IT peeps.\n\n1622\n01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:33,470\nI mean everybody from the lowest\nperson in the company,\n\n1623\n01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:34,430\nall the way up to the highest.\n\n1624\n01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:37,375\nThey all have to be part of security,\nbecause you can take a system.\n\n1625\n01:10:37,375 --> 01:10:38,610\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You can take your network and\n\n1626\n01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:42,010\nfollow these best practices and\nlock it down really nice.\n\n1627\n01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:44,430\nAnd you got a relatively secure network.\n\n1628\n01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:48,130\nIt takes one user to click\non a link in an email.\n\n1629\n01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:51,370\nAnd download a trojan horse and all of\na sudden, boom the bad guy's in no matter\n\n1630\n01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:55,190\nwhat you've done to your network, because\nyou've opened it up from the inside.\n\n1631\n01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:58,160\nOr to prop that back door open\nwhile he goes back out to his car,\n\n1632\n01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:00,280\nbecause he forgot his briefcase or\nsomething.\n\n1633\n01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:03,910\nAnd somebody's able to slip into\nthe network, or into the building and\n\n1634\n01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:05,820\nhave physical access to my machines.\n\n1635\n01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:09,670\nSo user education, you know,\nsecurity awareness is a huge part.\n\n1636\n01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:11,340\nWe've got to train our people.\n\n1637\n01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:13,900\nThey don't have to be IT pros, I mean,\nthat's why we get paid, you know?\n\n1638\n01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,170\nWe take care of the network.\n\n1639\n01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:20,680\nBut they do have to have\na basic understanding of ,you\n\n1640\n01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:27,060\nshouldn't click on links and\nemails that you don't know.\n\n1641\n01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:28,500\nChat programs and things like that.\n\n1642\n01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:32,760\nThey're not secure, there's not a lot of\nauthentication going on on some of those.\n\n1643\n01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,470\nTeaching them about how\nto keep the network safe,\n\n1644\n01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:38,400\nand how we all take a part of that.\n\n1645\n01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:39,760\nSo, user education and\n\n1646\n01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:43,650\nsecurity awareness has to come underneath\nall of those at all the different layers.\n\n1647\n01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:45,375\nAnd then the other one\nis physical security.\n\n1648\n01:11:45,375 --> 01:11:47,506\nAnd if you guys ever get a chance,\ntake a look,\n\n1649\n01:11:47,506 --> 01:11:52,070\nwe'll throw the link in the notes for this\nshow, the ten immutable laws of security.\n\n1650\n01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:53,647\nOne of my favorite ones is,\n\n1651\n01:11:53,647 --> 01:11:57,084\nif I can touch your computer\nIt's no longer your computer.\n\n1652\n01:11:57,084 --> 01:12:00,084\nAnd there's too many things a bad guy\ncan do if they've got physical access\n\n1653\n01:12:00,084 --> 01:12:01,060\nto a machine.\n\n1654\n01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:03,170\nI can boot it to another operating system.\n\n1655\n01:12:03,170 --> 01:12:06,690\nI could use one of the many techniques\nthat we can get into Windows and\n\n1656\n01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:08,200\nbypass the authentication method.\n\n1657\n01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,030\nI could just steal the hard drive and\ntake it home and\n\n1658\n01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:13,040\ntry to slave it into something else.\n\n1659\n01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:16,900\nSo physical security is a big part\nof keeping my network secure.\n\n1660\n01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,680\nThat means things like fences and\nguards and dogs,\n\n1661\n01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:22,210\ndepending on how secure\nthe facility has to be.\n\n1662\n01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:26,300\nLocks on the doors,\ncameras, chains for laptops.\n\n1663\n01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,110\nWhen people go traveling,\nwhat do you do with your laptop?\n\n1664\n01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:30,820\nMine won't fit in the little\nsafe that they give you, but\n\n1665\n01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:32,902\nI'm not gonna take my laptop\ndown to dinner with me.\n\n1666\n01:12:32,902 --> 01:12:34,850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I've gotta leave it in the room.\n\n1667\n01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:38,290\nHow do I keep that secure?\n\n1668\n01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:40,360\nMost laptops have a little\nchain lock on them or\n\n1669\n01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,530\nsomething like that that you can do.\n\n1670\n01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:45,500\nSo physical security becomes\na big part of it, as well.\n\n1671\n01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:49,810\nI just want to make sure we throw that\nin there, they will ask you about that.\n\n1672\n01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:52,840\n>> So I updated my drawing just a little\nbit, so this may not please Mike.\n\n1673\n01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,210\n>> Yeah, perfect.\nI like it.\n\n1674\n01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:56,060\n>> I actually tried to\nput it in the background.\n\n1675\n01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:59,837\nIt doesn't really look like it actually\nis, but as much as we can here.\n\n1676\n01:12:59,837 --> 01:13:03,410\nUnderstand that there are again, layers\neven in the defense in layer tier, but\n\n1677\n01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:08,240\nit does have to begin with you and\nme first of all actually understanding it.\n\n1678\n01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:11,500\nYou're getting the education through\nIt pro TV as well as your own learning.\n\n1679\n01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:15,430\nAnd then understand, we'll see when we\nget into the physical layer of security,\n\n1680\n01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:17,400\nyou've got to learn all\nabout that as well.\n\n1681\n01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:22,800\nBut it is a big part of what we actually\nend up doing here for providing the design\n\n1682\n01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,790\nsecurity that we need trying to get away\nwith this without actually helping someone\n\n1683\n01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:31,600\nto understand why they need to implement\nit, in terms of the user education.\n\n1684\n01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,850\nYou're just asking for problems.\n\n1685\n01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:33,360\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1686\n01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,680\n>> They're gonna implement it, they're not\ngonna know why they're implementing, and\n\n1687\n01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:38,825\nthen they're gonna wonder why\nit got violated or changed here.\n\n1688\n01:13:38,825 --> 01:13:44,560\n>> A simple example is a user that I\nknew that got a pop-up on their screen\n\n1689\n01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:48,260\nthat said, hey you've been infected and\nyou need to buy this antivirus software so\n\n1690\n01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:53,010\nwe can remove the 3,537 viruses\nthat we found on your machine.\n\n1691\n01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:53,570\nThey clicked on it.\n\n1692\n01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:55,900\nI mean they're like, my gosh,\nmy computer is infected.\n\n1693\n01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:57,110\nI'm gonna buy this software.\n\n1694\n01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:58,120\nI'm gonna clean it up.\n\n1695\n01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:01,570\nBecause they didn't know they were\nalready running antivirus software.\n\n1696\n01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:05,260\nAnd what the brand name was of the company\nthat provided antivirus software.\n\n1697\n01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:07,650\nAnd so to them it looked like\nthey were in trouble, but\n\n1698\n01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:10,730\nthey thought they were\ndoing the right thing.\n\n1699\n01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:13,770\nBut if we would have educated them\nabout the systems that we run, and\n\n1700\n01:14:13,770 --> 01:14:16,700\nabout the antivirus software we run or\njust that there's a procedure.\n\n1701\n01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:18,160\nHey, if you get something like that, and\n\n1702\n01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,650\nyou don't understand it,\nhere's who you're supposed to call.\n\n1703\n01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:22,280\nHere's who you're supposed to ask.\n\n1704\n01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:23,960\nOr a company will run a website,\n\n1705\n01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:27,360\nwe'll run an internal website with\nimportant notices and bulletins.\n\n1706\n01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:30,080\nHey lately there's been this\nemail chain going around,\n\n1707\n01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,100\nmake sure you don't click on it,\nor something like that.\n\n1708\n01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:35,730\nSo you're keeping them, like I said, not\ntraining them to be an IT professional,\n\n1709\n01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:38,830\nbut just giving them the basic\nknowledge they need to try to help\n\n1710\n01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:39,780\nkeep your network safe.\n\n1711\n01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:43,100\nBecause in the end, they're the ones\nthat are using the network.\n\n1712\n01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,850\nYou're setting it up,\nyou're getting it all secured.\n\n1713\n01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:47,130\nIf they don't take care of it,\n\n1714\n01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:51,600\nif they don't know how to work securely,\nthen all your efforts are for naught.\n\n1715\n01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,320\n>> Right, yeah.\n\n1716\n01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:57,640\nGood information for us to actually\nthink about and consider as well.\n\n1717\n01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:00,240\nNow we're coming right up on\nthe edge of our break here, and\n\n1718\n01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,000\nwe've got a little bit more to do.\n\n1719\n01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,670\nWe're gonna actually talk about\nthe idea of cloud computing next,\n\n1720\n01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:10,730\nbut it is right here on our break, so\nlet's go ahead and take a break now and\n\n1721\n01:15:10,730 --> 01:15:13,555\nwe'll see you right after our\nbreak to finish up this episode.\n\n1722\n01:15:13,555 --> 01:15:19,072\n[SOUND] All right welcome\nback to our continuing\n\n1723\n01:15:19,072 --> 01:15:24,741\nepisodic journey,\nthat's what we have here.\n\n1724\n01:15:24,741 --> 01:15:27,298\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Through the idea of\n\n1725\n01:15:27,298 --> 01:15:30,180\nsome network security design.\n\n1726\n01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:34,340\nAnd so we want to actually go ahead and\nwe're gonna finish this section up here.\n\n1727\n01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:38,535\nWe're taking a look at the exam objective\ndealing with the cloud computing.\n\n1728\n01:15:38,535 --> 01:15:43,210\n[INAUDIBLE] So, want to make sure that\nwe have just a general description of\n\n1729\n01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:47,640\ncloud computing, and some of the ways\nwe also see it implemented as well.\n\n1730\n01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:49,930\nSo when we start talking about\nthe idea of cloud computing,\n\n1731\n01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:53,030\nit comes in three particular\nforms here that we have.\n\n1732\n01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:57,140\nSo on the objectives, they specifically\ncall out the idea of platform\n\n1733\n01:15:57,140 --> 01:16:01,600\nas a service, software as a service and\ninfrastructure as a service.\n\n1734\n01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,620\nOkay, Mike, I'm going to let you\npick from one of those three.\n\n1735\n01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:07,741\n>> Well, let's start with software.\n\n1736\n01:16:07,741 --> 01:16:11,101\n[CROSSTALK] Might be a good place that\na lot of companies might break into this\n\n1737\n01:16:11,101 --> 01:16:12,072\ncloud environment.\n\n1738\n01:16:12,072 --> 01:16:14,970\nAnd here we're talking about,\nfist of all, what the heck is the cloud?\n\n1739\n01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:18,250\nWe're talking about the services being\nprovided out there on the Internet.\n\n1740\n01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:21,270\nSo that rather than host them internally,\n\n1741\n01:16:21,270 --> 01:16:24,050\nwe're gonna have some other\nprovider host them for us.\n\n1742\n01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:26,440\nSo then the question is, okay,\nwhat are they gonna provide for us?\n\n1743\n01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:29,910\nAnd the software at the service level,\nwe're talking about just an application.\n\n1744\n01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:32,510\nA good example might be Office 365.\n\n1745\n01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:34,690\n>> Which a lot of\ncompanies are going to and\n\n1746\n01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:38,640\nnow instead of having to install Office\non every computer in my building,\n\n1747\n01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:44,170\nI can just give them a key that they\ncan access Office from wherever.\n\n1748\n01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:46,730\nFrom inside, from outside, from the home.\n\n1749\n01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:49,640\nSo this provider is giving\nus the application.\n\n1750\n01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:52,140\nAnd I don't have to worry about\nupdating the application.\n\n1751\n01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:55,280\nI just pay my money,\nhowever much it costs me a month per user.\n\n1752\n01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,940\nAnd it can start adding up, depending.\n\n1753\n01:16:57,940 --> 01:17:00,410\nBut they're just providing\nthe application at that level.\n\n1754\n01:17:00,410 --> 01:17:02,368\n>> Yeah, the incredible benefit for\n\n1755\n01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:06,022\nmost of the people doing this is\nit gives you access everywhere.\n\n1756\n01:17:06,022 --> 01:17:08,215\nAnd the other thing is you don't\nhave to control the software at all.\n\n1757\n01:17:08,215 --> 01:17:09,620\n>> Right.\n>> So I don't have to worry about,\n\n1758\n01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:13,726\nis Mike taking a copy that he shouldn't\nand putting it on his own computer?\n\n1759\n01:17:13,726 --> 01:17:17,455\nBy doing it as a cloud service it really\ndoes provide just that that we need.\n\n1760\n01:17:17,455 --> 01:17:19,405\nAnd so\nyou do see a lot of companies doing this.\n\n1761\n01:17:19,405 --> 01:17:21,973\nSo not only you have things like\nMicrosoft, but you have Google doing it\n\n1762\n01:17:21,973 --> 01:17:25,815\nlike Drive and their network documents and\nall the different ones you have.\n\n1763\n01:17:25,815 --> 01:17:26,965\n>> Right, Google Docs, exactly.\n\n1764\n01:17:26,965 --> 01:17:29,725\n>> Yeah.\nAnd so this is a great platform for\n\n1765\n01:17:29,725 --> 01:17:32,075\nus wherein that companies will use this,\nbut\n\n1766\n01:17:32,075 --> 01:17:34,145\nthat means also something else,\nthough, Mike.\n\n1767\n01:17:34,145 --> 01:17:38,538\nWhat if I now type in the word\nconfidential on my doc in Office 365.\n\n1768\n01:17:38,538 --> 01:17:39,071\nAnd I hit save.\n\n1769\n01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:40,325\n>> Yeah.\nWhere is it being stored?\n\n1770\n01:17:40,325 --> 01:17:42,150\n>> Yeah.\nWhere is it being stored?\n\n1771\n01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:45,550\nAnd so you've gotta think about\nthese types of components as well.\n\n1772\n01:17:45,550 --> 01:17:47,510\nAnd remember this is\npart of your designing.\n\n1773\n01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,920\nIs this gonna be stored\nin a secure location?\n\n1774\n01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,720\nWhen users access it,\nis it actually secured here.\n\n1775\n01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:55,790\nWhen we start thinking\nabout something like this.\n\n1776\n01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:59,260\nSo again, part of our security\ndesign is to discuss this,\n\n1777\n01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:01,630\nunderstand that this may be\nsomething we choose to use.\n\n1778\n01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:04,910\nMaybe some we look at and go look, it's\njust not something we want to do here.\n\n1779\n01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:08,850\nBut cloud services in terms of\nhosting something somewhere else\n\n1780\n01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:11,780\nis only getting more popular, and\nyou're gonna see it more and more.\n\n1781\n01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:14,335\nAnd you've got to get use to\nit as security professionals.\n\n1782\n01:18:14,335 --> 01:18:16,115\n>> Absolutely.\nSo then we can take it a step further.\n\n1783\n01:18:16,115 --> 01:18:19,640\nSo we might start out with just doing\nsome software as a service like that.\n\n1784\n01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,940\nAnd again, we don't have to worry\nabout updating the software,\n\n1785\n01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:23,310\npatching and things like that.\n\n1786\n01:18:23,310 --> 01:18:26,090\nWe want a little more control we can\ngo with something called platform\n\n1787\n01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:26,990\nas a service.\n\n1788\n01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:31,150\nWhere all of a sudden they're giving us\nan operating system, a base to use and\n\n1789\n01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:33,530\nthen we're installing our\napplications on top of that.\n\n1790\n01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:34,730\nNow all of a sudden.\n\n1791\n01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:37,160\nWe're responsible for\ninstalling the applications,\n\n1792\n01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:40,200\nthe version that we're using,\nupdating it, things like that.\n\n1793\n01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,560\nBut I don't have to worry about\nthe OS that it's running on.\n\n1794\n01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,590\nThey're gonna be patching the servers and\nthings like that, and\n\n1795\n01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:47,420\nkeeping those up to date.\n\n1796\n01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:49,720\nIf a server fails,\nit's no concern of mine.\n\n1797\n01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:52,500\nI've got an SLA with them that says\nthey're gonna bump me over to another\n\n1798\n01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:56,260\nserver if something happens then give\nme that expected level of up time and\n\n1799\n01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:57,110\nthings like that.\n\n1800\n01:18:57,110 --> 01:18:58,800\nMaybe a little more expensive.\n\n1801\n01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:02,380\n>> Yeah definitely, but it does\nprovide us with so much flexibility.\n\n1802\n01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:04,680\nA lot of times you can choose what server.\n\n1803\n01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:08,180\nAnd also a lot of times you can choose\nwhat level, the hardware to appoint.\n\n1804\n01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:10,710\nYou can say,\nI want 8 gigs of RAM or 12 gigs.\n\n1805\n01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:13,553\nI'm gonna access it just\nsix hours a day not 24/7.\n\n1806\n01:19:13,553 --> 01:19:18,400\nWhatever you want to do here, this\nplatform as service is a huge advantage.\n\n1807\n01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,590\nEspecially if you actually have,\nton of applications.\n\n1808\n01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:24,550\nBut you know that hey, I can't\nprovide this for everything, I want\n\n1809\n01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:27,940\nto actually be able to run an operating\nsystem but let's host it somewhere else so\n\n1810\n01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:30,530\nI don't have to worry about it\ngoing down at my business here.\n\n1811\n01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:32,320\n>> Yep.\n>> If you only need one server this may be\n\n1812\n01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,230\nthe way to go.\n\n1813\n01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:35,460\nThey went ahead and\nthey managed the whole thing.\n\n1814\n01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:38,490\nBut a lot of times though,\nwe may need more than that.\n\n1815\n01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:39,250\n>> More than just servers.\n\n1816\n01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:41,830\nAnd then we start moving into\nthe infrastructure of servers.\n\n1817\n01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:45,710\nWhere they're gonna basically give me\nall the network components that I need\n\n1818\n01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:50,660\nto lay out a, I don't want to call it a\nLAN, but basically a LAN out in the cloud.\n\n1819\n01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:53,083\nI get my routers, my switches,\nmy servers and everything.\n\n1820\n01:19:53,083 --> 01:19:55,442\nNow this point typically though,\nI'm responsible for\n\n1821\n01:19:55,442 --> 01:19:56,958\ninstalling the operating system.\n\n1822\n01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,958\nUpgrading them, patching them,\nbacking them up.\n\n1823\n01:19:59,958 --> 01:20:01,208\nThat's another thing\nwe got to worry about.\n\n1824\n01:20:01,208 --> 01:20:04,190\nWho's maintaining that infrastructure.\n\n1825\n01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:07,185\nThey're just saying like here's\nthe components, you know.\n\n1826\n01:20:07,185 --> 01:20:10,920\n>> Yeah, this one is for person that\nsays look I need the equipment,\n\n1827\n01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:13,550\nI need the hardware.\n\n1828\n01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:16,000\nBut let's say that Mike says\nhey I'm gonna build this out.\n\n1829\n01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,920\nAnd he starts actually taking a look and\nit costs him like six or seven servers.\n\n1830\n01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:22,910\nHe's putting in a couple switches and\nnow his build is up to,\n\n1831\n01:20:22,910 --> 01:20:24,440\nlet's say 70 to 100,000 dollars.\n\n1832\n01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,210\nI don't know if he'll spend that.\n\n1833\n01:20:26,210 --> 01:20:29,820\nBut he may actually look at that and go\nahead and balance that out and go, look,\n\n1834\n01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:33,370\nI can go to a cloud service provider, and\nthey can provide me with six servers.\n\n1835\n01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:35,500\n>> Right.\n>> And it's going to be just about\n\n1836\n01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:39,720\nthis much but then they're actually\nmaintaining it as being up 24 hours a day.\n\n1837\n01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,250\n>> Right.\n>> Mike doesn't have to worry about\n\n1838\n01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:43,900\nupdating hardware every two or\nthree years or four years.\n\n1839\n01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:45,881\n>> Exactly,\nthat's another thing as we grow.\n\n1840\n01:20:45,881 --> 01:20:49,537\nIf I had physically bought that hardware,\nnow I've got to worry about upgrading that\n\n1841\n01:20:49,537 --> 01:20:52,502\nhardware and replacing it,\nwhat's the lifetime of that hardware.\n\n1842\n01:20:52,502 --> 01:20:53,120\n>> That's right.\n\n1843\n01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:57,110\n>> If I'm just renting it or\nthrough the cloud, then they're\n\n1844\n01:20:57,110 --> 01:21:00,960\ngonna keep their stuff up to date and\nwe can just upgrade as we go along.\n\n1845\n01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,790\n>> And those are some of the big\nbenefits that we have here.\n\n1846\n01:21:03,790 --> 01:21:07,290\nNot having to come out with a ton of out\nof money in terms of having a lot of\n\n1847\n01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:10,990\nequipment then if we move location we\nalso have to move that stuff along and\n\n1848\n01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:12,180\nget it set back up.\n\n1849\n01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:15,545\nBut now we can simply move buildings and\nif our infrastructure's built up up there.\n\n1850\n01:21:15,545 --> 01:21:16,120\n>> Right.\n\n1851\n01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,030\n>> We just connect our\nlittle firewall up and\n\n1852\n01:21:18,030 --> 01:21:21,450\nwe're ready to go and often we're going.\n\n1853\n01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:24,820\nSo you do weigh out the benefits here,\nbut, again, providing security for\n\n1854\n01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:26,000\nit is another thing.\n\n1855\n01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,870\nNow, when we start taking a look at\nwhere in the world do we get these cloud\n\n1856\n01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:30,860\nservices, is what we're\ntaking a look at here.\n\n1857\n01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:34,040\nAnd so there's several different\nways that you can access these, and\n\n1858\n01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:38,360\nall of these are actually services that\nyou can look up on the internet as well.\n\n1859\n01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:41,080\nBut there are actually a couple of\ndifferent types that we want to make sure\n\n1860\n01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:41,890\nthat you're aware of too.\n\n1861\n01:21:41,890 --> 01:21:46,370\nThere is something that we call\nthe idea of the Private Cloud here.\n\n1862\n01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:48,860\nNow we take a look at that\nidea in the Private Cloud.\n\n1863\n01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:53,230\nThese are companies that have\nbuilt up an entire Databank.\n\n1864\n01:21:53,230 --> 01:21:59,191\nA bank of servers, probably gigantic\nwarehouses full of servers there.\n\n1865\n01:21:59,191 --> 01:22:01,080\n>> Right.\n>> That they have.\n\n1866\n01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:04,330\nBut they don't go ahead and\nput it directly on the Internet.\n\n1867\n01:22:04,330 --> 01:22:06,715\nThey actually provide it through\nsome other service provider.\n\n1868\n01:22:06,715 --> 01:22:07,270\n>> Right.\n\n1869\n01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:11,720\n>> And this gives you, then,\nas a company, the ability to connect to\n\n1870\n01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:14,630\na private network and\nto access your own services as well.\n\n1871\n01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:15,740\n>> And it's not shared.\n\n1872\n01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:16,920\nWe're talking about private.\n\n1873\n01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:20,220\nNow we're not talking about having to\nworry about any other companies having\n\n1874\n01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:24,110\nservers hosted on the same virtualization\nplatform and things like that.\n\n1875\n01:22:24,110 --> 01:22:26,070\nThis is a private cloud, it's just for us.\n\n1876\n01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:28,220\nIt's gonna be more expensive typically,\n\n1877\n01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:32,470\nbut depending on the level of security you\nneed that might be the way you wanna go,\n\n1878\n01:22:32,470 --> 01:22:35,980\nand your in more control over what's\ngoing on in that private cloud.\n\n1879\n01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:38,800\n>> Yeah, so I just pulled up a couple\nof different examples that I looked for\n\n1880\n01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:41,220\nduring the break a little\nbit earlier on our show here\n\n1881\n01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:43,840\n>> But HP Helion is one of these ideas\n\n1882\n01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,990\nof a private Cloud here.\n\n1883\n01:22:44,990 --> 01:22:48,850\nAnd again you can go their website and\nthey can market you like crazy so\n\n1884\n01:22:48,850 --> 01:22:51,018\nyou get to choose theirs as well.\n\n1885\n01:22:51,018 --> 01:22:53,210\nAnd of course Microsoft has their own.\n\n1886\n01:22:54,530 --> 01:22:57,930\nCisco has there own and there's tons of\ncompanies out there that are actually\n\n1887\n01:22:57,930 --> 01:23:00,725\nputting their life online saying that this\nis what they believe that the future's\n\n1888\n01:23:00,725 --> 01:23:03,760\ngonna hold for most businesses they're\ngonna be accessing it this way.\n\n1889\n01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,840\nThe reason why you might choose a Private\nCloud is the industry that you're in.\n\n1890\n01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:09,830\nFor example; if you're in the banking\nindustry, you don't want to go and\n\n1891\n01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:11,950\nconnect across the internet to\nget access to your servers.\n\n1892\n01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:13,497\n>> No.\n>> You want actually put that on\n\n1893\n01:23:13,497 --> 01:23:14,450\na private server.\n\n1894\n01:23:14,450 --> 01:23:15,960\n>> There's probably government and\n\n1895\n01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:20,060\nindustry regulations, thinks like that\nare going to restrict that as well.\n\n1896\n01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:22,212\n>> Yeah, so\nprivate cloud solution may be the way for\n\n1897\n01:23:22,212 --> 01:23:25,150\nyou to go if you're actually\nneed something like that.\n\n1898\n01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:32,020\nBut small companies are, you know MASH you\nchoose, if I can find my objectives again.\n\n1899\n01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:37,000\nMay instead choose the idea of just a\nregular public cloud to be able to go to.\n\n1900\n01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,260\nAnd there's services like this.\n\n1901\n01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:40,175\nIn other words,\nthey're accessible from the Internet.\n\n1902\n01:23:40,175 --> 01:23:41,040\n>> Right.\n\n1903\n01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:47,030\n>> So things like Azure, I know we always\nsay Azure, it's Azure, Microsoft Azure.\n\n1904\n01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:48,310\n>> It's broccoli and cheese.\n\n1905\n01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:49,182\n>> Broccoli and cheese, Azure.\n\n1906\n01:23:49,182 --> 01:23:49,860\n>> It's the soup of the day.\n\n1907\n01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:56,200\n>> For us here, things like this, where we\ncan access this through the internet, and\n\n1908\n01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,570\nwe're not so worried about that.\n\n1909\n01:23:57,570 --> 01:24:02,000\nA lot of times Amazon, E3Cloud,\nthese are places, or S3,\n\n1910\n01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,510\nI keep saying E3,\nthe S3Cloud that they have,\n\n1911\n01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:08,780\nyou name it, those are places again\nthat are accessible by the internet.\n\n1912\n01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:13,620\nThey can provide the same type of\ninfrastructure that you actually need but,\n\n1913\n01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:15,090\nagain, now over the Internet.\n\n1914\n01:24:15,090 --> 01:24:16,430\nUsually, a little bit cheaper for\n\n1915\n01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:19,270\nyou cuz you're actually accessing it\nover that shared network as well.\n\n1916\n01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:20,000\n>> So, very convenient.\n\n1917\n01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,080\nI mean, it's, you can access\nthe data from anywhere, anytime.\n\n1918\n01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:24,780\n>> Yeah.\n\n1919\n01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:26,870\nNow most companies,\nof course have figured this out.\n\n1920\n01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:29,480\nThey don't wanna just corner one market,\nthey wanna corner everything.\n\n1921\n01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:30,930\n>> Right.\n>> And so they've implemented both.\n\n1922\n01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:34,710\nAnd of course, Microsoft, HP,\nthey essentially provide it all, okay.\n\n1923\n01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:36,390\n>> Right.\n>> They can't have a completely\n\n1924\n01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:37,240\nprivate network, which\n\n1925\n01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,180\nagain is not accessible by the internet\n>> But\n\n1926\n01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:42,490\nthen add the other side of the business\nas well, so they have the hybrid.\n\n1927\n01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:45,740\nThe only one that's brand new\nto me that I've learned about\n\n1928\n01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:50,210\nfrom just the 401 objectives is this\nidea of what we call a community cloud.\n\n1929\n01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:51,420\n>> Community cloud?\n\n1930\n01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:53,420\n>> Yeah.\nA community cloud's a little bit more\n\n1931\n01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:59,120\nunusual here, and\nthere is a company out there called\n\n1932\n01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:02,790\nCompuCom of all the ones\nthat you actually have.\n\n1933\n01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:06,060\nAnd this is where smaller companies\nhave essentially grouped together, said,\n\n1934\n01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:07,972\nlook, individually, we can't afford it.\n\n1935\n01:25:07,972 --> 01:25:09,900\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n>> We're not Microsoft, we're not HP,\n\n1936\n01:25:09,900 --> 01:25:12,610\nwe're not Cisco to be able to do this.\n\n1937\n01:25:12,610 --> 01:25:14,940\nNot yet, they're hoping to compete.\n\n1938\n01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:18,260\nBut it gives them the flexibility\nto essentially co-opt,\n\n1939\n01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:20,990\nI think, is the best way to\nactually think about this.\n\n1940\n01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:24,460\nSo that they can actually use those\nservices together and be able to share\n\n1941\n01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:28,890\nthe benefits behind it as technology kind\nof updates, they all update, as well.\n\n1942\n01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:30,525\nAnd so it gives that ability to do so.\n\n1943\n01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:31,380\n>> Absolutely.\n>> So\n\n1944\n01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:34,930\nyou may choose to do this because you\nlike the idea or you might thinking\n\n1945\n01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:38,760\nthat the services are the ones that\nyou really need provision for as well.\n\n1946\n01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:43,715\nAll of those are actually viable for\nus in terms of cloud computing, okay.\n\n1947\n01:25:43,715 --> 01:25:46,655\nAnd you'd think that you're going\nto get away without doing it.\n\n1948\n01:25:46,655 --> 01:25:48,405\nWell, you're probably not\ngoing to get away with it.\n\n1949\n01:25:48,405 --> 01:25:49,055\n>> Probably not.\n\n1950\n01:25:49,055 --> 01:25:50,425\nIt's changing very fast.\n\n1951\n01:25:50,425 --> 01:25:54,335\nNow for all you systems engineers and\nsystems administrators, don't worry.\n\n1952\n01:25:54,335 --> 01:25:56,285\nYou know, our networks are not going away.\n\n1953\n01:25:56,285 --> 01:25:59,860\nWe still have some resources that\nhave to be provided internally.\n\n1954\n01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:01,600\nSo our server closets\nare not gonna disappear.\n\n1955\n01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,110\n>> Yep.\n\n1956\n01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:03,570\n>> And we need our authentication servers,\n\n1957\n01:26:03,570 --> 01:26:07,210\nwe need our DNS servers local to us,\nDHCP service, things like that.\n\n1958\n01:26:07,210 --> 01:26:08,160\nSo that stays.\n\n1959\n01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:10,290\nThis is just extending\nour responsibilities.\n\n1960\n01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:11,880\n>> Yep.\n>> In our job and things like that.\n\n1961\n01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:15,700\nWe now have to worry about our\ninternal network as well as our cloud.\n\n1962\n01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:16,360\n>> Yeah.\n\n1963\n01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:20,470\nAnd that's the key to understanding this\nis that the idea of the management and\n\n1964\n01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:23,770\nthe security behind it doesn't\nget offloaded to the provider.\n\n1965\n01:26:23,770 --> 01:26:24,820\nSome of it does but,\n\n1966\n01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:28,150\nthe very fact is, it's our data; we\nshould be responsible for securing it.\n\n1967\n01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:30,142\n>> Even if we're not the ones\nthat are implementing it,\n\n1968\n01:26:30,142 --> 01:26:33,210\nwe better read those contracts [CROSSTALK]\nand have those in place and understand.\n\n1969\n01:26:33,210 --> 01:26:35,711\nWhat they're providing,\nwhat they're not providing, so\n\n1970\n01:26:35,711 --> 01:26:38,220\nthat I know that I'm\ntaking care of that part.\n\n1971\n01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:42,060\n>> Yeah, the overall benefit for us,\nagain, is we don't have to worry about\n\n1972\n01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:45,700\ncoming out with building our own\ninfrastructure before we can add in more.\n\n1973\n01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:49,760\nIf I need one, I can go ahead and,\nagain, provide that.\n\n1974\n01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,350\nAnd again, payments is kinda the key here.\n\n1975\n01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:53,690\n>> Right.\n>> Without having to\n\n1976\n01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:56,620\nbuild up a whole stockpile\nof inventory of equipment.\n\n1977\n01:26:56,620 --> 01:26:57,230\n>> How easy is that?\n\n1978\n01:26:57,230 --> 01:26:59,880\nIt's like hey, we need another server,\nI can just call him up and\n\n1979\n01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:03,390\nsay, how long is it gonna be before\nyou can turn on the new server for me?\n\n1980\n01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:05,020\n>> Yeah, and that's pretty much it.\n\n1981\n01:27:05,020 --> 01:27:07,940\nAnd so you're starting to see more and\nmore of this, especially for\n\n1982\n01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:08,880\nstartup companies.\n\n1983\n01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,620\nWell, we do this with\nthe ITProTV web server as well.\n\n1984\n01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:15,614\nBecause we don't want a physical\npower failure here in our building.\n\n1985\n01:27:15,614 --> 01:27:17,610\n>> Right.\n>> To really bring down anything for\n\n1986\n01:27:17,610 --> 01:27:20,250\nour subscribers,\nwe actually have it hosted on the cloud,\n\n1987\n01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:22,510\nwhich again has redundancy built in.\n\n1988\n01:27:22,510 --> 01:27:26,160\nAnd they provide for it and\nthen they have everything that we need.\n\n1989\n01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:30,060\nSo we're very proud to actually be\nusing cloud services to really help us\n\n1990\n01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:30,960\nout in doing this.\n\n1991\n01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,602\n>> And as you grow, I mean,\ninstead of having to worry about,\n\n1992\n01:27:33,602 --> 01:27:37,510\nnot gonna go order more RAM for\nthat server, or something like that.\n\n1993\n01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:39,390\nWe just call them up and say,\nhey we need a little bit more of this.\n\n1994\n01:27:39,390 --> 01:27:39,940\n>> That's it.\n\n1995\n01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:40,970\n>> Yeah.\nSpend a little bit of money,\n\n1996\n01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:42,190\nand we're good to go.\n\n1997\n01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:44,981\n>> Yeah.\nSo, for overall network design elements,\n\n1998\n01:27:44,981 --> 01:27:49,333\nright, we've gone through a list of\ndifferent things that we've actually had.\n\n1999\n01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:53,530\nWe started from the idea of\nthe outside moving in here, right.\n\n2000\n01:27:53,530 --> 01:27:57,000\nThe idea of understanding that we\nhave to provide defense in depth.\n\n2001\n01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,249\nIt's not enough just to say hey,\nI'm defending my one machine.\n\n2002\n01:28:00,249 --> 01:28:01,833\nWe need to provide for layers of this so\n\n2003\n01:28:01,833 --> 01:28:05,270\nthat we actually have a complete\nprotection that we need in our networks.\n\n2004\n01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:05,870\nWe've gone through and\n\n2005\n01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:09,410\nwe've talked about some of the elements\nwe wanna consider in that design as well.\n\n2006\n01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:11,700\nIncluding, and things like,\nremind me here.\n\n2007\n01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:12,600\nDMZs.\n\n2008\n01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:13,320\n>> Right.\n\n2009\n01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:15,280\n>> We've talked about subnetting and\nVLANs.\n\n2010\n01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:16,050\n>> Breaking that down.\n\n2011\n01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:19,960\nIt really, if you think about it, you just\nthat drawing that Ronnie's got is perfect.\n\n2012\n01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,170\nJust think about it on the way in.\n\n2013\n01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:23,350\nYou've got bad guys outside and\n\n2014\n01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:25,160\nso the first thing they run\ninto is that perimeter.\n\n2015\n01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:26,750\nI've got my firewalls there.\n\n2016\n01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:30,640\nIf they happen to make it through that,\nwell now they're on a segment of my\n\n2017\n01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:34,650\nnetwork on a subnet and they better be\nable to figure how to jump across that.\n\n2018\n01:28:34,650 --> 01:28:37,850\nOnce they get on that subnet they don't\nstop there right because my hosts\n\n2019\n01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:41,380\nthat are on those subnets are gonna\nbe secured and hardened and\n\n2020\n01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:44,480\nrunning anti-virus software and\nusing good strong authentication methods.\n\n2021\n01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,770\nIf they happen to break into the host\nmy defense doesn't stop there.\n\n2022\n01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:49,830\nThe applications that\nare running on the host.\n\n2023\n01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:51,850\nAre hardened and protected and patched.\n\n2024\n01:28:51,850 --> 01:28:53,640\nIf they make it through that,\nwe don't stop there.\n\n2025\n01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:57,580\nThe data that the application are\naccessing is hardened and is protected.\n\n2026\n01:28:57,580 --> 01:28:59,670\n>> Right.\n>> So it's every single layer, and\n\n2027\n01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:02,280\nyou know one of the things we\ndidn't mention was IDSs and IPSs.\n\n2028\n01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,650\n>> Yeah.\n\n2029\n01:29:03,650 --> 01:29:07,110\nYou know, I get the idea of\nthese layers is at some point,\n\n2030\n01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:08,620\nthey're going to trigger some alarm.\n\n2031\n01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:09,290\nHopefully.\n\n2032\n01:29:09,290 --> 01:29:12,410\nAnd we're going to notice the attack and\ndo something about it.\n\n2033\n01:29:12,410 --> 01:29:13,110\n>> Right.\n\n2034\n01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:15,810\n>> Whereas, if we don't have all these\ndifferent layers, if they get through one\n\n2035\n01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:18,890\nlayer, and they're in, and\nwe don't even notice that they're there.\n\n2036\n01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:23,040\nThey set up a little backdoor program and,\nI don't even catch it.\n\n2037\n01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:27,300\nSo, we've gotta just, the layers it's\na good thing as far as it gives you,\n\n2038\n01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:29,140\nmakes it harder for the bad guy.\n\n2039\n01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:31,110\nI don't wanna give him\nthe keys to the office.\n\n2040\n01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:33,820\nAnd it gives us more time\nto detect the attack.\n\n2041\n01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:36,790\nBefore they make it into\nthat sensitive information.\n\n2042\n01:29:36,790 --> 01:29:39,370\nGood design is normally in that\nlayer of approach here and\n\n2043\n01:29:39,370 --> 01:29:41,540\nleads to great security for us.\n\n2044\n01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:44,400\nWhat we've provided here is\nagain a little episode for\n\n2045\n01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:47,120\nyou to actually think about some of\nthe components that you may include.\n\n2046\n01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:48,370\nIn your network design and\n\n2047\n01:29:48,370 --> 01:29:52,060\nalso have to think about providing\nthe security for as well.\n\n2048\n01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:52,840\nOkay.\n\n2049\n01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:53,500\nAll right.\nIs\n\n2050\n01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:56,240\nthere anything else I would have\nforgotten Mike, that you can think of?\n\n2051\n01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:57,410\n>> I think we did it pretty good.\n\n2052\n01:29:57,410 --> 01:30:00,350\nI mean, we'll be breaking a lot of this\nstuff down in a little more detail as we\n\n2053\n01:30:00,350 --> 01:30:01,690\ngo through the rest of this course.\n\n2054\n01:30:01,690 --> 01:30:03,250\nBut I think that was a good start.\n\n2055\n01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:03,800\n>> Yeah.\n\n2056\n01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:06,570\nSo stay tuned off the other episodes\nthat are actually coming along for\n\n2057\n01:30:06,570 --> 01:30:09,280\nus in our security plus\njourney together here.\n\n2058\n01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:13,260\nBut for this episode, that ends our\nepisode here on network design.\n\n2059\n01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:15,740\nRemember that for each and\nevery episode and\n\n2060\n01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:18,190\nevery day, we're actually recording live.\n\n2061\n01:30:18,190 --> 01:30:22,220\nAnd so if you're actually there and you're\nwatching, you have access to our chat.\n\n2062\n01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:24,470\nPlease feel free to ask\nquestions during our time.\n\n2063\n01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:26,515\nWe'll make sure Mike answers\nthat is what we'll do.\n\n2064\n01:30:26,515 --> 01:30:27,650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You also have,\n\n2065\n01:30:27,650 --> 01:30:30,690\nof course access to the website as well.\n\n2066\n01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:33,560\nTo all of our courses\nas well as a Q&A there.\n\n2067\n01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:36,510\nTake advantage of actually asking\nquestions there if you need to.\n\n2068\n01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:37,840\nWe monitor, we answer.\n\n2069\n01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:40,500\nWe want to make sure that you\nhave the answers that you need\n\n2070\n01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,290\nbefore you go into the exam booth.\n\n2071\n01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:44,730\nNot during the exam as you're taking it.\n\n2072\n01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:47,240\nSo go ahead and\ngive us a shout out out there too.\n\n2073\n01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:51,250\nAnd we'll respond to those as we need to,\nokay?\n\n2074\n01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:54,270\nSo, at all times,\nplease feel free to contact us and\n\n2075\n01:30:54,270 --> 01:30:55,620\nbeing able to do that, okay?\n\n2076\n01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:58,850\nBut for today, we're gonna go ahead and\nend this episode here.\n\n2077\n01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:02,210\nSo, signing off for ITPro.tv,\nmy name is Ronnie Wong.\n\n2078\n01:31:02,210 --> 01:31:02,870\n>> I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n2079\n01:31:02,870 --> 01:31:05,410\n>> And\nwe will see you in

right, welcome everybody\nto another episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:40,601\nI'll be your host, Mike Roderick and here\nwith me today is my good friend Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:41,370\nHow you doing, Wes?\n\n7\n00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:41,940\n>> I'm doing okay.\n\n8\n00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,100\nIt's been a little bit since I was here.\n\n9\n00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,730\n>> It has been awhile.\n\n10\n00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:44,490\nGood to have you back.\n\n11\n00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,660\n>> Oh, man, it's great to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,340\n>> And you're gonna be with us for\nquite a while,\n\n13\n00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,930\na whole week worth of Wes Bryan, I think.\n\n14\n00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,320\n>> It's great to be back.\n\n15\n00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,160\n>> Good deal, good deal.\n\n16\n00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,410\nAll right, well, good to have you here.\n\n17\n00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,450\nIf you saw our last episode we went\nthrough, gosh, what did we go through?\n\n18\n00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,530\nAll kinds of devices, and\nI have to recap that episode.\n\n19\n00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,270\nBut anyway, in this episode,\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\n\n20\n00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,080\nsome of the different protocols\nthat we're gonna go through.\n\n21\n00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,630\nWe're gonna go through just\nbasically defining the protocols,\n\n22\n00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,330\ntalking about where you might use\nthe protocols, what they're used for,\n\n23\n00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,000\nwhat port numbers they're gonna go across,\nand maybe some vulnerabilities\n\n24\n00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,540\nassociated with the different protocols,\nand just basically a lot of definitions.\n\n25\n00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,210\nSo maybe not the most exciting stuff,\nbut stuff we have to know, right?\n\n26\n00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,092\n>> Yeah, and we definitely get into\na little bit more of the theory and\n\n27\n00:01:28,092 --> 00:01:32,790\nwe're gonna be talking a little bit about\nthe OSI model and the reference model, and\n\n28\n00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,650\nwe're gonna talk about some protocols\ntoday and just kinda show you how they\n\n29\n00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,730\nmap out to the different layers of that\nopen systems interconnection model.\n\n30\n00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,340\nA lot of theory.\n\n31\n00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,800\nSometimes the theory stuff isn't as\nfun as dealing with the devices and\n\n32\n00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,810\nconfiguring firewalls.\n\n33\n00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,500\n>> But it's that foundational knowledge,\nright?\n\n34\n00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,340\nI mean, people always ask me why do I\nhave to know all these darn port numbers?\n\n35\n00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,360\nWhy is that important?\n\n36\n00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,610\nWell, if you've got an application that\nrequires choosing FTP or choosing HTTPS,\n\n37\n00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,560\nif you don't know what port\nnumber that that's going across,\n\n38\n00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,930\nthat's gonna be difficult to allow that\nprotocol to go through your firewall.\n\n39\n00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,490\nWhen you're looking at your logs and\nyou're seeing things coming across\n\n40\n00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:09,400\ndifferent port numbers, it's important\nthat we understand what protocols\n\n41\n00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,170\nare being used so\nwe can keep our network safe.\n\n42\n00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,090\n>> Yeah and definitely from a security\nstandpoint too when you talk about port\n\n43\n00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,560\nscanning and port mapping and knowing what\nservices are going across your network,\n\n44\n00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,300\nit really is important\nto know those ports.\n\n45\n00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,950\nCuz I'll tell you one thing,\nthose hackers know the ports.\n\n46\n00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,830\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n47\n00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,220\nAnd knowing what protocol to use and\nwhen to use it.\n\n48\n00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,310\nWhen is it appropriate?\n\n49\n00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,308\nAnd we've got several choices.\n\n50\n00:02:28,308 --> 00:02:31,140\nIf I wanna connect to a web server,\nwe can do HTTP, we can do HTTPS.\n\n51\n00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,710\nIf I wanna remotely control the sever,\nI can do Telnet, I can do SSH.\n\n52\n00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,880\nWhy pick one over the other?\n\n53\n00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,280\n>> That's right.\n>> And there's advantages and\n\n54\n00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,320\ndisadvantages to each one, so it's\nimportant we understand a little bit about\n\n55\n00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,030\nthem so we know which one to choose and\nwhich one to implement in our network.\n\n56\n00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,730\n>> Definitely, yep.\n\n57\n00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,520\n>> All right, well let's just start.\n\n58\n00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,020\nI'll tell you what, why don't we start\nwith just a little bit of a review.\n\n59\n00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,760\nI am sure at this point in your\ntraining you've probably already gone\n\n60\n00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,680\nthrough the network plus.\n\n61\n00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,150\nIf not, maybe jump back over there and\ntake a look.\n\n62\n00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,450\nWe're gonna talk about the OSI model,\ncuz it's really, to get an idea,\n\n63\n00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,379\nto be able to talk intelligently\nabout the different protocols,\n\n64\n00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,365\nwe gotta have a little background for\nthat.\n\n65\n00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:06,355\nWe gotta understand where this stuff\nfits in, and it's really based on that,\n\n66\n00:03:06,355 --> 00:03:09,250\nas you said, the open system interconnect,\nor that OSI model.\n\n67\n00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,680\nSo let's talk a little bit about that,\nand where that came from, and\n\n68\n00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,300\nwhat we use it for.\n\n69\n00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,840\n>> Yeah, definitely.\nWell back in the early 80's,\n\n70\n00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,180\nmany people were coming out with all\ndifferent types of standards and\n\n71\n00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,590\neverybody's doing it\npretty much their own way.\n\n72\n00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,710\nIf you didn't have one device,\nyou couldn't talk to their networks.\n\n73\n00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,878\nSo an organization called\nthe International Organization for\n\n74\n00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:29,218\nStandardization.\n\n75\n00:03:29,218 --> 00:03:32,095\nLook at their acronym and\nit doesn't map out, right?\n\n76\n00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:33,095\n>> It does not, does it?\n\n77\n00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:33,603\n[LAUGH]\n>> Standards by,\n\n78\n00:03:33,603 --> 00:03:34,737\nthey can't get their own name right.\n\n79\n00:03:34,737 --> 00:03:36,638\n[LAUGH] But it's-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n80\n00:03:36,638 --> 00:03:37,157\nThere needs to be a standard for that.\n\n81\n00:03:37,157 --> 00:03:39,557\n>> That's right.\nJust an abbreviated form of the word Isis\n\n82\n00:03:39,557 --> 00:03:41,690\nfrom Greek, which means equality or equal.\n\n83\n00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,210\nBut yes, they came out with this model and\n\n84\n00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:49,036\ndid entirely a standardized network\ncommunications and bring a consistency so\n\n85\n00:03:49,036 --> 00:03:52,030\nthat you have more of\nan inner operability.\n\n86\n00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,790\nAnd it's a seven layer model and when we\nlook at how it's broken down each model,\n\n87\n00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,420\nor each layer in the model kinda helps\nservice lower layers and assists that data\n\n88\n00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,510\nfrom the moment we click the keyboard and\nwe've got our input to the moment\n\n89\n00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,450\nthat it's delivered on the other end\nto whoever the recipient might be.\n\n90\n00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,700\n>> Exactly, and I know if I write\nan application or I develop a device, and\n\n91\n00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,420\nI follow the OSI model, then my device\nshould work with other devices.\n\n92\n00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,240\nIt should be able to communicate\non the same networks.\n\n93\n00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,110\nSo by having that standard and\n\n94\n00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,660\nall following the standard it just\nallows all these different vendors to\n\n95\n00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,290\ncreate these devices and protocols and\napplications and have them work together.\n\n96\n00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,390\nAnd not have a real problem.\n\n97\n00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,090\n>> Yeah, and you know, also about\nformatting your data in a way that, for\n\n98\n00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,665\ninstance, in network communications,\n\n99\n00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:32,514\nthat the network doesn't\nhave to be aware of it.\n\n100\n00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:35,127\nThe network can focus more on what\nit's supposed to be doing and\n\n101\n00:04:35,127 --> 00:04:37,110\nthat's moving the data\nfrom point A to point B.\n\n102\n00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,170\n>> Exactly.\n\n103\n00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,862\nAre you a top-down kinda guy?\n\n104\n00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,214\n>> Yep.\n>> Yeah, you like to go from the bottom\n\n105\n00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,477\nup when you look at your [CROSSTALK].\n\n106\n00:04:42,477 --> 00:04:44,092\n>> I think I'm gonna be a top-down guy.\n\n107\n00:04:44,092 --> 00:04:44,650\n>> Top-down guy.\n\n108\n00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,840\nAll right, let's start at the top then.\n\n109\n00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,050\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n110\n00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,920\nSo when we start at the top of the model,\nthe OSI model, we talk about layer seven.\n\n111\n00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,760\nLayer seven's called the application\nlayer, and it really gives our data and\n\n112\n00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,440\nother applications that we work with\nas users, we interface with, or\n\n113\n00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,260\ninteract with,\nthe ability to communicate with a network.\n\n114\n00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,820\nSo it's kinda like the starting\npoint into the network.\n\n115\n00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,110\nSo just make sure that when you're\nlooking at the application layer,\n\n116\n00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,445\nthat you understand that all\nthe application layer really is\n\n117\n00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:15,155\ndoing is giving our applications\nthat we interact with and\n\n118\n00:05:15,155 --> 00:05:18,085\nour data that entrance into the services\nthat the network can provide.\n\n119\n00:05:18,085 --> 00:05:18,695\n>> Right, right.\nSo\n\n120\n00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:21,155\nthis is really where we\ninteract with it and\n\n121\n00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:23,435\nthe applications therefore\nthat we're connecting with.\n\n122\n00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:25,919\n>> Yeah, it's about the only\nlayer I think that we have,\n\n123\n00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,947\nwithout doing the configurations\nof routers and stuff like that,\n\n124\n00:05:28,947 --> 00:05:31,778\nwhere we really have any interaction\nwith the network at all.\n\n125\n00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:33,730\n>> Especially as an end user,\nthis is really your access to the network.\n\n126\n00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,237\n>> As an end user, yep, definitely.\n\n127\n00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:35,887\n>> That'll work.\n\n128\n00:05:35,887 --> 00:05:36,687\nAll right.\n\n129\n00:05:36,687 --> 00:05:40,858\n>> And then the next layer that we have\nis layer seven, or excuse me, layer six.\n\n130\n00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:43,210\nI swear I know how to count\nfrom seven backwards.\n\n131\n00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,748\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Is layer six.\n\n132\n00:05:44,748 --> 00:05:49,038\nAnd layer six the presentation layer and\nlayer six is about formatting data,\n\n133\n00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:51,168\nmaking it compatible with the network.\n\n134\n00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:54,300\nAnd again, we want our data to\nbe transparent to the network so\n\n135\n00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,280\nthe network can move it where it needs\nto go, and that's where it starts at.\n\n136\n00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,520\nIt starts at layer six, the OSI bottle.\n\n137\n00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,470\nAnd that's where we get we get things\nlike compression and encryption, and so\n\n138\n00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:08,040\nwhen you talk about encrypting data and\nscrambling in a way that a attacker\n\n139\n00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,110\ncome lately with a man in the middle\nattack can't see what that information is.\n\n140\n00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,360\nThat's where it's starting out.\n\n141\n00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,490\nYou get some of your graphics file\nextensions and stuff, formatting graphics\n\n142\n00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:23,040\nlike PNG and stuff will sit on that same\nlayer, layer six, the presentation layer.\n\n143\n00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,860\nAnd as we move down, the next thing\nthat we have is layer five, and\n\n144\n00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,310\nlayer five is the session layer.\n\n145\n00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,790\nThe session layer's responsible for\n\n146\n00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,990\ndefining the parameters of\nthe communication, setting up that\n\n147\n00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,000\ncommunication, maintaining it, and then\nfinally tearing down the communication\n\n148\n00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,680\nonce we're done sending data and\nmaybe moving on to the next data packet.\n\n149\n00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,350\nLayer four is where we start to see pretty\nmuch like the workhorse of the network.\n\n150\n00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,980\nLayer four's where we\nstart moving the data.\n\n151\n00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,310\nThat's the transport layer and\nit's appropriately named because\n\n152\n00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,170\nwe use protocols that we're\ngonna talk about coming up.\n\n153\n00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,560\nLike transmission control protocol and\nuser datagram protocol and\n\n154\n00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,440\nnow we're talking about\nstarting to figure out what is\n\n155\n00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,490\nthe protocol that we're gonna set our data\nin and start to move it along the network.\n\n156\n00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,344\nBut the problem is without addressing, we\nreally don't know where the destination is\n\n157\n00:07:13,344 --> 00:07:15,508\ncuz when we talk about\nnetwork communications,\n\n158\n00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:17,648\nwe're really talking\nabout the destination.\n\n159\n00:07:17,648 --> 00:07:19,400\nWhere is that information going?\n\n160\n00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,380\nAnd layer three of the OSI model,\nthe network layer.\n\n161\n00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,250\nThis is where we see things like IP and\nIP's responsible for\n\n162\n00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,490\naddressing those packets, source and\ndestination, if you will, and\n\n163\n00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:35,480\nthen properly routing, making decisions\nabout where to send the information,\n\n164\n00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,350\ncontrolling things like congestion.\n\n165\n00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,820\nAnd then moving down to layer two.\n\n166\n00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,583\nThis is where we start\ntalking about physical links.\n\n167\n00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:46,581\nWe start talking about communicating\nwithin our local area networks,\n\n168\n00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:51,113\nnot necessarily getting that information\nbetween the two remote networks, but\n\n169\n00:07:51,113 --> 00:07:53,125\nnow we're talking within the LAN.\n\n170\n00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:57,125\nAnd getting prepared to deliver\nto the final destination.\n\n171\n00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:59,508\n>> Right.\n>> The last layer is layer one,\n\n172\n00:07:59,508 --> 00:08:01,520\nwhich is the physical layer.\n\n173\n00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,980\nThe physical layer talks about\nthe electrical mechanics,\n\n174\n00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,620\nthe medium if you will, like fiber optic\n\n175\n00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,910\nwhat copper I know we talk about in some\nof the other episodes about coaxial but\n\n176\n00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,730\nyou really don't see coaxial for\nnetwork implementations.\n\n177\n00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,342\n>> Right.\n>> So it's typically some kind of twisted\n\n178\n00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:20,141\npair copper based media like that or\na fiber optic communications and\n\n179\n00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:23,009\nagain just defining the electrical\ncharacteristics of the network.\n\n180\n00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:24,740\n>> Yeah, right, right, very good.\n\n181\n00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,470\nSo yeah so seven layers again and\nJason, I got a quick image pulled up,\n\n182\n00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:33,496\nI know we talked about these\nin our network plus episode.\n\n183\n00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:35,140\nBut that's you know what\nWes was talking about,\n\n184\n00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,810\nright there is the different layers that\nour data is gonna have to go down through.\n\n185\n00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,970\nOn the way down.\n\n186\n00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,770\nAnd then going back up on the other side.\n\n187\n00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,657\nSo we're dealing with that application\nat that application layer.\n\n188\n00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:49,208\nAnd as it comes down, through there,\nit's getting each session, or\n\n189\n00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,474\neach layer is really adding\na little bit to that packet, right?\n\n190\n00:08:52,474 --> 00:08:53,135\n>> Yeah, that's it.\n\n191\n00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:57,970\nYou see in that picture that you pulled\nup there we start out with just raw data.\n\n192\n00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,510\n>> Right.\n\n193\n00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,400\n>> It's not gonna do anything.\n\n194\n00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,370\nWe've talked about before, that letter\nthat you're gonna send in the mail.\n\n195\n00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,340\nYou can't just a letter\nput it in the mail and\n\n196\n00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,860\nexpect the carrier to be able\nto take it where it needs to go.\n\n197\n00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,610\n>> So\nthat's why my mother never gets those.\n\n198\n00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,380\n>> Well you got to check your mailbox.\n\n199\n00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,314\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I bet she got a lot of wet\n\n200\n00:09:12,314 --> 00:09:16,976\nsoggy letters in there that haven't\ngone anywhere, so we have raw data and\n\n201\n00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:19,426\nas we talk about the formatting.\n\n202\n00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,990\nGoing down through, through these layers,\n\n203\n00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,910\neach layer is really just adding a service\nthat's gonna help the next layer below it.\n\n204\n00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,350\n>> Exactly, exactly all right, so\n\n205\n00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,910\nwe got a good idea of the layer\nof our OSI model then.\n\n206\n00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,680\nSo now we can start talking\nabout the protocols and\n\n207\n00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,790\nwe can let you guys know where\nthey fit into that OSI model.\n\n208\n00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,650\nSome protocols work at individual layers,\nsome work on.\n\n209\n00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,470\n>> Some work on multiple layers.\n\n210\n00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,010\n>> Go across multiple layers, exactly.\n\n211\n00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,480\nA lot of the protocols we\ndeal with are suites really.\n\n212\n00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,360\nLike when we look at TCP/IP\nit's not a single protocol.\n\n213\n00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,960\nIt's several protocols wrapped up\nin one little family or bundle.\n\n214\n00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,470\n>> Yeah.\n\n215\n00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,970\n>> And so let's go through some of\nthe different, more common protocols, and\n\n216\n00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,050\nwe'll talk about where we\nmight see these protocols and\n\n217\n00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:02,180\nthen where they work at in that OSI model\nas well as the port numbers we'll be using\n\n218\n00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,970\nto allow those protocols into our network.\n\n219\n00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:04,530\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n220\n00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,980\nI think the first one I wanna tackle\nis kinda out of order from what our\n\n221\n00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,472\nobjectives are, and it's TCP IP,\nbecause TCP IP are two protocols.\n\n222\n00:10:11,472 --> 00:10:15,510\nYou know one that offers reliability,\nthe other one, IP, offers addressing but\n\n223\n00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,410\nwhen you look at them together,\nthey're not really just two protocols.\n\n224\n00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,340\nLike Mike said, it's a suite of protocols,\nit's a family of protocols, and\n\n225\n00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,430\neach one is assisting the other.\n\n226\n00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:27,140\nSo this kinda sits on all layers\nif you really think about it,\n\n227\n00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,190\nwith these multiple protocols\nbeing in this family.\n\n228\n00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,490\nThis goes back to the days of ARPANET\noriginally called the DOD protocol suite,\n\n229\n00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,890\nbecause it's a\n>> Right.\n\n230\n00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,278\n>> Defense advance\nresearch project agency,\n\n231\n00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:41,640\nyou know and\na couple of universities that invented it.\n\n232\n00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,530\nSo, it really sits on multiple layers\nbecause it's not just those two protocols.\n\n233\n00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:49,200\nThose are just two very important\nprotocols within a larger body of\n\n234\n00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,190\nprotocols.\n\n235\n00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,180\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n236\n00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,373\nAnd then you know TCP being\ntransmission control protocol.\n\n237\n00:10:54,373 --> 00:10:55,802\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> IP being.\n\n238\n00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:57,880\n>> Internet protocol.\n\n239\n00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,698\n>> Internet protocol, exactly.\n\n240\n00:10:58,698 --> 00:10:59,927\n>> Yeah.\nAnd one so, but\n\n241\n00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:04,070\nif you want to look at the individual,\nthose two individual protocols.\n\n242\n00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,610\nThe Transmission control protocol,\nit's got, when it comes to the layers,\n\n243\n00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,150\nit's definitely got some identity issues.\n\n244\n00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,860\n>> It does, it does.\n\n245\n00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,270\n>> It doesn't really know\nwhere it wants to be.\n\n246\n00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:15,320\n>> I've got a little diagram pulled up\nhere, cuz you know, the OSI model is.\n\n247\n00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,020\nA model right,\n\n248\n00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,090\nI mean it doesn't have to be followed\nexactly, you can not follow it at all.\n\n249\n00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,540\nYour device won't work with anything else,\nbut you know but it is a model and\n\n250\n00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,200\nguideline, and so as long as your\nparticular protocol you're designing\n\n251\n00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,120\nfits into that model,\nit's not set in stone.\n\n252\n00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,922\n>> Yeah.\n>> So there's a little bit of\n\n253\n00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:31,447\nflexibility there.\n\n254\n00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:32,925\n>> Yeah.\nAnd another thing too,\n\n255\n00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,967\nwhen you look at the different models,\nnot to go far into the models,\n\n256\n00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:39,280\ncuz I know we definitely addressed\nvery in-depth in some other episodes.\n\n257\n00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,583\n>> Right.\n>> But you look at the open systems\n\n258\n00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,856\ninterconnection model and it was designed\nto provide an interoperability between all\n\n259\n00:11:43,856 --> 00:11:44,906\nnetwork communications.\n\n260\n00:11:44,906 --> 00:11:48,732\nAnd when you look at Transmission\nControl Protocol/Internet Protocol or\n\n261\n00:11:48,732 --> 00:11:53,286\nTCP/IP family, it's really designed and\noptimized around internet specific tasks,\n\n262\n00:11:53,286 --> 00:11:57,250\nyou know, it was invented before we had\nreally what was called the internet.\n\n263\n00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,520\n>> Right.\nThe World Wide Web.\n\n264\n00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,280\n>> That's right.\n\n265\n00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,870\nSo, everything was focused on that, but\n\n266\n00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:04,490\nwhen you at Transmission Control Protocol,\nback to the OS side model.\n\n267\n00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,700\nYou'll see that it sits\nat the session layer.\n\n268\n00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:11,860\nIt also sits at the transport layer, and\nI believe, maybe not the network layer,\n\n269\n00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,130\nbut I know that it sits at\nthe session in the transport layer,\n\n270\n00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,780\nbreaking information down,\nconnection oriented service.\n\n271\n00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,690\nSo it's session layer.\n\n272\n00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,190\nRemember, session layer, setting up that\nconnection there, and maintaining it,\n\n273\n00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,960\nso transmission control protocol\nbeing connection oriented.\n\n274\n00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,860\nAlso has some of its functionality\nthere at the session layer too.\n\n275\n00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,630\nIP specific sits at the network layer,\nresponsible for\n\n276\n00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,850\nrouting connection lists, doesn't care\nabout if the data gets there or not.\n\n277\n00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,605\nAnd that's why they usually couple\nit if you do need some kind of\n\n278\n00:12:38,605 --> 00:12:41,290\nconnection-oriented service\ninsuring reliable delivery,\n\n279\n00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,480\nthey usually couple it with TCP.\n\n280\n00:12:44,592 --> 00:12:46,980\n>> All right, so\nthat gives us a good break on TCP.\n\n281\n00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,860\nWhat do you want to do next?\n\n282\n00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,680\n>> If you want,\nwe can follow them in order now.\n\n283\n00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,230\n>> I like it.\n\n284\n00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,190\nI like it.\n\n285\n00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,120\n>> IPsec, I think you know\na little it about this one.\n\n286\n00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,580\n>> IPsec is a great protocol,\nright, it's a way that we can,\n\n287\n00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,970\nit's used to secure the traffic or\nthe data as it travels across the network.\n\n288\n00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:05,544\nIP being Internet Protocol,\nsec being security, so IPsec,\n\n289\n00:13:05,544 --> 00:13:09,830\nyou know we've talked about a little bit\nin our some of our other episodes about\n\n290\n00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,580\nyour data is traveling, it's getting\nformed under these packets, these frames.\n\n291\n00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,240\nThey're being sent across the network, and\nif you're using a protocol that we call\n\n292\n00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,090\na plain text protocol that means that the\ndata that's in those packets is readable.\n\n293\n00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:25,260\nSo if I can get a packet capture\nutility like Wire-shark or\n\n294\n00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,790\nMicrosoft Network Monitor or\nsomething like that,\n\n295\n00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:30,950\nI can capture those raw packets and\nI can read everything out of there.\n\n296\n00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,030\nSo if you're sending an e-mail from one\ncoworker to another and I'm on that same.\n\n297\n00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,730\nLand and I can get in between you and him,\n\n298\n00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:39,880\nI can read the information\nthat's in that e-mail.\n\n299\n00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,092\nI can see your username and password\nif you're using an unsecured protocol.\n\n300\n00:13:43,092 --> 00:13:47,520\nSo IPsec is a protocol that\nallows me to encrypt that data\n\n301\n00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,070\nas it travels across the network, and\n\n302\n00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:54,670\none of the fantastic things about IPsec\nis it occurs way down on the OSI model.\n\n303\n00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,193\nWe're talking about way down at layer two?\n\n304\n00:13:56,193 --> 00:13:58,741\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I believe it's at layer three.\n\n305\n00:13:58,741 --> 00:14:01,130\n>> And then from there down.\n\n306\n00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,930\nSo the application does\nnot have to be aware.\n\n307\n00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,490\nThe application has no idea that the data\nis being encrypted once it gets that\n\n308\n00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,635\nfar down on the, on the OSI stack.\n\n309\n00:14:10,635 --> 00:14:12,280\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then it travels across the network\n\n310\n00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,690\nin a protected state, and it comes back\nup the other side of that stack at the\n\n311\n00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,930\nreceiving end, and it's decrypted before\nit ever reaches those higher levels.\n\n312\n00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:20,570\n>> Yep.\n>> So the,\n\n313\n00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,220\nit's, it's what we call\napplication independent.\n\n314\n00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:23,900\n>> Yep.\n>> Where as, you know,\n\n315\n00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,390\na protocol like we're gonna talk about,\nHTTPS,\n\n316\n00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,470\nI mean that has to be built\ninto the application.\n\n317\n00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,310\nThe browser, for example,\nhas to understand that protocol.\n\n318\n00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,555\nIP6, anything because they\ndon't have to be aware.\n\n319\n00:14:34,555 --> 00:14:35,390\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n320\n00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,560\n>> We use it in our VPN tunnels when we,\n\n321\n00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,570\nwhen typically when we're using layer\ntwo turning protocol, I will bring IP6,\n\n322\n00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:47,070\nwe used it in-house to protect network\ndata as it travels across the network.\n\n323\n00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,180\nSo, a lot of people don't think about,\nencrypted files.\n\n324\n00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,980\nIn Windows we can encrypt the files\nbuilt into NTFS If I take\n\n325\n00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,980\nan encrypted file on a file server and\nI copy down to my local hard drive, it's\n\n326\n00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,160\nencrypted while it's on the file server,\nit's encrypted on my local hard drive,\n\n327\n00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,660\nit is not encrypted while it\ntravels across the network.\n\n328\n00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,830\n>> Sounds like what you've guys have\ntalked about on some of the other secure\n\n329\n00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,870\nsecurity episodes where we have\nto implement due diligence.\n\n330\n00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,140\nI need,\nI've got somebody else's information.\n\n331\n00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,750\nI mean, it's on our server,\nbeing stored on our servers but\n\n332\n00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,270\nit might be personally identifiable,\nnot PII necessarily but\n\n333\n00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,075\nyou know something that's confidential and\nshould remain confidential Potential.\n\n334\n00:15:19,075 --> 00:15:20,520\n>> Um-hm.\n>> So, we need to make sure that when we\n\n335\n00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,990\ndo transfer it from point a to point b\nthat nobody else can see that information.\n\n336\n00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,980\n>> Exactly.\n>> Sure.\n\n337\n00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,790\nAnd built into it they've got a couple\nin caps excuse me, protocols for\n\n338\n00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,980\nencryption or integrity.\n\n339\n00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,120\nWe'll talk about in the, in security plus\nhere, and I know that they've mentioned\n\n340\n00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,610\nit pretty in depth in some of\nthe other security chapters.\n\n341\n00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,834\nThat CIA triad, confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n342\n00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:46,457\nAnd when we use something known as Or\nauthentication header,\n\n343\n00:15:46,457 --> 00:15:51,679\nauthentication header Is a protocol\nthat will provide authenticity and\n\n344\n00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:57,433\nintegrity of our data, and it uses a\nmessage digest five or I believe it's SHA.\n\n345\n00:15:57,433 --> 00:16:00,053\n>> A Secure Hashing Algorithm, as well.\n\n346\n00:16:00,053 --> 00:16:01,230\nSo you can kinda configure it for\nwhat you need.\n\n347\n00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:04,090\nAnd then you can make sure that if\nanybody's delivering your data over\n\n348\n00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,090\nthat authentication header,\nthat for instance,\n\n349\n00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,940\nif I'm sending information to Mike,\nMike knows that it had to of come from me.\n\n350\n00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,630\nAnd he also knows, because he can check\nthe data before he even believes what Wes\n\n351\n00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,300\nsays, it doesn't even check what Wes says.\n\n352\n00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,320\nAnd he runs the same message digest\nacross and he can take that value and\n\n353\n00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,820\nhe can compare the two and if they match,\n\n354\n00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,670\nhe knows that the data has\nmaintained it's integrity.\n\n355\n00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,230\nIf not, he discards it,\nand he says hey Wes,\n\n356\n00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,850\ncome on send that back here\nget it right this time.\n\n357\n00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,080\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n358\n00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,440\nSo every now and again, we gotta just\nunderstand some basics about it.\n\n359\n00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,650\nIt is a protocol that's gonna allow me\nto secure that traffic as it travels\n\n360\n00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,680\nacross the network.\n\n361\n00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,430\nWe're gonna provide,\nas Wes was saying, non-repudiation.\n\n362\n00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,482\nWe can verify the originator of that data.\n\n363\n00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:46,640\nIt's gonna provide for anti-replay\nprotection, it's got sequence numbers in\n\n364\n00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,110\nthere, some timestamp information so\nthat people can't, I can't break the data.\n\n365\n00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,449\nI can't break your password, either.\n\n366\n00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:55,318\nI can't decrypt it, but\nwhat if I just replayed the packet later?\n\n367\n00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:59,640\nThe system's gonna know and it's going to\nprotect against that data authenticity and\n\n368\n00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,270\nintegrity, as you're saying,\nwith the digital signatures.\n\n369\n00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,050\nAnd it's platform independent,\nit's non-proprietary standard, and most,\n\n370\n00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:09,870\nall Windows operating systems\nunderstand it, since 2003 I think.\n\n371\n00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,920\nLinux, Unix can use it.\n\n372\n00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,502\nWe also need to understand that\nit does need to be set up.\n\n373\n00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:18,080\nAll right,\nyou have to configure at either end,\n\n374\n00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,378\nyou almost have to think\nof it as a language, right?\n\n375\n00:17:20,378 --> 00:17:23,880\nAnd you've gotta teach either end of\nthe conversation to speak that language.\n\n376\n00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,920\nIn other words if my computer\nis configured to use IPsec,\n\n377\n00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,490\nwe have what we call IPsec policies.\n\n378\n00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:33,120\nIf my computer has an IPsec policy and\n\n379\n00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,840\nit tries to communicate\nwith Wes's computer, but\n\n380\n00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,940\nWes doesn't have IPsec configured on his,\nwe're not gonna be able to communicate.\n\n381\n00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,320\nIt's like Wes's computer doesn't\nknow the same language as me.\n\n382\n00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,740\nSo we're going to set it up on either\nend and we can use this, like I said,\n\n383\n00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,130\nto protect data between a computer and\na server.\n\n384\n00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,790\nIf you have a file server and everything\non that file server is sensitive, right?\n\n385\n00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:57,930\nI can make sure that anybody who talks to\nthat machine has to understand IPsec, or\n\n386\n00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,660\nthey don't get to talk to that machine.\n\n387\n00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,750\nWe can use it for\ncommunication between two hosts.\n\n388\n00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,270\nWe can use it within our VPN tunnels.\n\n389\n00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,060\nWe can also use it to create\nisolation networks, all right?\n\n390\n00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,210\nIf all the computers on\nmy network require IPsec,\n\n391\n00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,360\nthey've all been configured with\na policy that requires IPsec.\n\n392\n00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,230\nIf a vendor comes in with his laptop,\nhis laptop's not configured with the same\n\n393\n00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,740\npolicy as my company, he won't be able to\ncommunicate with any of the computers on\n\n394\n00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:27,156\nmy network, because he doesn't understand\nhis policy is not compatible with mine.\n\n395\n00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:29,149\nSo, we can make isolation\nnetworks out of it as well.\n\n396\n00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,930\nSo, very, very cool little protocol.\n\n397\n00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,870\nIt's just used all over the place.\n\n398\n00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,820\n>> And I like what you mentioned.\n\n399\n00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,060\nIt's transparent to the application.\n\n400\n00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:41,043\nLike Mike says that it happens at the\nlower layers, by the time we talk about\n\n401\n00:18:41,043 --> 00:18:45,222\nstripping off the encapsulating security\npayload there, the encryption and\n\n402\n00:18:45,222 --> 00:18:49,016\nstuff, and it goes back up to\nthe application layer, it's completely\n\n403\n00:18:49,016 --> 00:18:53,542\ntransparent to the application and it\ndoesn't even realize that it's happening.\n\n404\n00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:56,276\nAnd that's what we talk about\nwith these different layers,\n\n405\n00:18:56,276 --> 00:19:00,150\nhelping service other layers, is that the\nnetwork doesn't have to be aware of this.\n\n406\n00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:04,607\nNow it's doing the encryption here at\nthe security here at the network layer but\n\n407\n00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:08,333\nby the time that information gets\ndelivered to our applications,\n\n408\n00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,813\nit doesn't have to work.\n\n409\n00:19:09,813 --> 00:19:11,904\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n410\n00:19:11,904 --> 00:19:13,450\nSo IPsec, what's next?\n\n411\n00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,210\nSNMP?\n\n412\n00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,440\n>> Yeah.\nSimple Network Management Protocol.\n\n413\n00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,850\nThere's three different versions.\n\n414\n00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,960\nThis is an application layer protocol\nthat we use to help monitor our devices\n\n415\n00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,380\non our networks and\nyou can use an SNMP monitoring station and\n\n416\n00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,840\nyou have SNMP software agents,\nas they call it.\n\n417\n00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,100\nAnd the agents essentially,\nthey report their condition,\n\n418\n00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,125\ntheir health state back to\nthis management station there,\n\n419\n00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:40,000\nand I think they call them SNMP traps or\nsomething and\n\n420\n00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,740\nthat's sending the information\nback to the monitoring station.\n\n421\n00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,750\nIt's gone through some different versions.\n\n422\n00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,710\nOne of the original versions, I imagine\nits version one, was the first one and\n\n423\n00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,860\nvery simple, easy to set up.\n\n424\n00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,460\nAnd then there was version two,\nwhich I don't know, but\n\n425\n00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,960\nI think a lot of devices use it today\nas version two there by default.\n\n426\n00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,200\n>> Right.\n>> I'm not really sure of that,\n\n427\n00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,680\nbecause I know that the version\nthree uses encryption.\n\n428\n00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,996\nSo now we get,\nstart to get a confidentiality and\n\n429\n00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,209\nnobody can grab that\ninformation in transit.\n\n430\n00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:08,605\n>> Cuz it could be sensitive information,\nright?\n\n431\n00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:11,967\nWhen you look at SNMP, as we said,\nSimple Network Management Protocol,\n\n432\n00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:15,655\nas what I said, the different devices that\nwould have an agent that ran on them and\n\n433\n00:20:15,655 --> 00:20:17,160\nit would use, what was it?\n\n434\n00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,030\nManagement Information Blocks or\nMIBs, which report back.\n\n435\n00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,030\nWe set up traps to gather the information.\n\n436\n00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,310\nSo that router might be sitting there,\njust saving this information,\n\n437\n00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,270\nlike hey, I have sent this many packets.\n\n438\n00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,240\nI have dropped this many\npackets per second.\n\n439\n00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,430\nAnd then we can get that information\nfrom our management station,\n\n440\n00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,450\nwe can reach out to those devices,\nwe can pull that information back, and\n\n441\n00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,730\nthen we can monitor them.\n\n442\n00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,508\nMake sure that they're\nfunctioning properly,\n\n443\n00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:43,971\ntry to spot any problems before\nit becomes something major.\n\n444\n00:20:43,971 --> 00:20:45,864\nAnd we could connect\nin two different ways.\n\n445\n00:20:45,864 --> 00:20:51,802\nYou can connect with a read-only access,\nor you can connect with a write-access,\n\n446\n00:20:51,802 --> 00:20:57,071\nand then so we, I remember the default\non the Windows network was public for\n\n447\n00:20:57,071 --> 00:21:00,960\nthe read-only and\nthen private for the read-write.\n\n448\n00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,265\nSo one of the first things\nyou had to remember to do,\n\n449\n00:21:03,265 --> 00:21:06,703\nif you were gonna use SNMP, was to\nchange those default passwords, right?\n\n450\n00:21:06,703 --> 00:21:09,822\nTo make sure that, otherwise anybody\ncould get write access to your device and\n\n451\n00:21:09,822 --> 00:21:12,540\nthat would not be good,\nchange the configuration of it.\n\n452\n00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,062\n>> So just basic hardening of\nwhatever the application in this way,\n\n453\n00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:20,001\nthe hardening of the application, so\nthat we don't leave those defaults and\n\n454\n00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:24,080\nsomebody can exploit them just by visiting\nGoogle and typing in SNMP, whatever.\n\n455\n00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,580\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n456\n00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,560\n>> Exactly.\nYou remember port number for that?\n\n457\n00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,500\nI was trying to think.\n\n458\n00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,765\nIt's been so\nlong since I looked this [CROSSTALK]\n\n459\n00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:30,129\n>> I don't have an SNMP\n\n460\n00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:35,620\nport off the top of my head, but\nI will here in just one moment here.\n\n461\n00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,767\n>> I wanna say, why did I say.\n\n462\n00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:42,612\n>> I'm gonna put UDP port 161.\n\n463\n00:21:42,612 --> 00:21:43,784\n>> 161, was that it?\n\n464\n00:21:43,784 --> 00:21:44,863\n>> [SOUND] Booyah.\n\n465\n00:21:44,863 --> 00:21:50,313\nThat's right, yeah, and\nthen they got the trap there as port 162.\n\n466\n00:21:50,313 --> 00:21:53,695\nSo we got port 161, port 162.\n\n467\n00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:54,215\n>> Good deal.\n\n468\n00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:55,710\n>> And it uses both TCP and UDP.\n\n469\n00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,285\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n470\n00:21:56,285 --> 00:22:00,475\nYeah, and so if that's something that\nyou're gonna implement in your network,\n\n471\n00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:02,785\nthen you just have to be aware of what\nsome of the vulnerabilities are and\n\n472\n00:22:02,785 --> 00:22:06,155\nlike I said, one of the biggest ones is\nmaking sure you've set the passwords to\n\n473\n00:22:06,155 --> 00:22:07,630\nconnect to those agents.\n\n474\n00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,020\nAnd you gotta talk to the vendor,\nthey're gonna let you know whether or\n\n475\n00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,780\nnot they run SNMP,\nwhether that device supports SNMP,\n\n476\n00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,350\nso that you can manage\nit remotely like that.\n\n477\n00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,880\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n478\n00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,170\n>> All right, onto SSH.\n\n479\n00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,250\n>> Yes, Secure Shell.\n\n480\n00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,810\n>> Secure Shell, let's jump\n>> Okay.\n\n481\n00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,140\n>> Let's close to Telnet.\n\n482\n00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,270\n>> Okay, we can do that.\n\n483\n00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:28,759\nAnd let's mention real quick too that\nrelevance back to the OSI model,\n\n484\n00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:31,970\npart of the objective's SNMP is\nan application layer protocol.\n\n485\n00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,016\n>> Oh, very good, very good.\n\n486\n00:22:33,016 --> 00:22:34,730\nI almost forgot that.\n\n487\n00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,880\n>> Telnet, that's an oldie but goodie.\n\n488\n00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,774\n>> Yeah it is, it's been around for\na long time, right?\n\n489\n00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:42,389\nThis was basically a way to send remote\ncommands to a sever that you were trying\n\n490\n00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:44,870\nto manage and it was very common to use.\n\n491\n00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,834\nYou just open up a command prompt and\nyou could connect to any port.\n\n492\n00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,990\nIt has a default 4, what, 25?\n\n493\n00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,760\n>> 423.\n>> 423.\n\n494\n00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,089\n25 is SMTP.\n\n495\n00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:55,654\nSo it had that default port\nyou could connect to, but\n\n496\n00:22:55,654 --> 00:22:57,531\nyou could really connect to any port.\n\n497\n00:22:57,531 --> 00:22:59,615\nIn fact, we used to use it all the time\njust to see if a port was open.\n\n498\n00:22:59,615 --> 00:23:00,449\n>> Okay, yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n499\n00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:03,968\nYeah, you could just do Telnet, the IP\naddress, and then the port number and\n\n500\n00:23:03,968 --> 00:23:07,164\nsee if you can establish a connection and\nthat would tell you whether or\n\n501\n00:23:07,164 --> 00:23:10,390\nnot that that device was listening or\nhad that port open on a firewall.\n\n502\n00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,380\nWhat was the downside of Telnet?\n\n503\n00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,443\n>> I believe it's clear text protocol.\n\n504\n00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:16,028\n>> It is plain text all the way.\n\n505\n00:23:16,028 --> 00:23:17,444\n>> [CROSSTALK] Everything that's going.\n\n506\n00:23:17,444 --> 00:23:19,525\n>> Even the authentication\npart was plain text, so\n\n507\n00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:23,234\nanybody that was running packet capture\ncould see your authentication information,\n\n508\n00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:26,147\nthey could grab your username and\npassword and then connect as you.\n\n509\n00:23:26,147 --> 00:23:29,611\n>> That's right, that's right, and\nwhen you look at this protocol, you'd say\n\n510\n00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:32,833\nwell why would anybody ever wanna\ninvent a protocol that'd be like that?\n\n511\n00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:37,458\nWell when this protocol was first\nbrought into networking, we're talking\n\n512\n00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,433\nabout maybe three universities and\nour defense advance research\n\n513\n00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:46,347\nproject agency was the only people in\nthe network, were only Bodies if you will,\n\n514\n00:23:46,347 --> 00:23:50,391\nthat were even on any network, so\nin those days it wasn't really,\n\n515\n00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:55,630\nyou didn't worry about eavesdropping,\nyou didn't worry about grabbing the data.\n\n516\n00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,870\nBecause it was only a handful of companies\nthat were even connected to the networks.\n\n517\n00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:03,170\nBut then with that expansion and\nthe boom and definitely the dot com boom,\n\n518\n00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,420\nwe gotta definitely have to\nrethink on anything that goes.\n\n519\n00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:12,020\nYeah all of a sudden we're sending data\nover public networks, or if we've got and\n\n520\n00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,970\nwe've given other companies\naccess to our network.\n\n521\n00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,990\nAnd now, we really gotta worry\nabout keeping that safe.\n\n522\n00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,060\nSo Telnet is definitely frowned upon,\nnot really used much anymore.\n\n523\n00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,240\nBut we have replacements for it.\n\n524\n00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,880\nAnd that's where SSH come in,\nor my secure shell.\n\n525\n00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,642\nAnd that's basically the same\nkind of concept, but\n\n526\n00:24:28,642 --> 00:24:31,130\nit's going to encrypt that data.\n\n527\n00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,540\nSo that I don't have to worry about those,\ncuz that's another thing.\n\n528\n00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,690\nMan in the middle attacks with that\nTelnet, because it's that plain text.\n\n529\n00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,600\nAnd with SSH,\nI don't have to worry about that.\n\n530\n00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,250\n>> Yeah, and you probably seen in a lot\nof, like the Cisco episodes, that the guys\n\n531\n00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:47,510\nare using something like PUTTY in order\nto configure these devices in a way that\n\n532\n00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:51,150\nnobody out there on the network can sit\nthere and grab any of that configuration\n\n533\n00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:55,040\ninformation and pretty much just reverse\nengineer your network infrastructure.\n\n534\n00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,371\nSo it is important that if you're,\nI'm a little redundant here, connecting to\n\n535\n00:24:59,371 --> 00:25:03,720\nthe connectivity device that you have\nmake sure that those commands are secure.\n\n536\n00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,557\nAnd so we've got a couple of protocols\nhere, now, it's interesting.\n\n537\n00:25:07,557 --> 00:25:12,644\nWe're jumping around the OSI model because\nTelnet sits at the application layer but\n\n538\n00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:14,945\nSSL sits down at the transport layer?\n\n539\n00:25:14,945 --> 00:25:16,360\n>> SSH.\n>> Oh I'm sorry SSH yeah.\n\n540\n00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:22,660\nI'm sorry SSH sits down there at\nthe transport layer, like Mike says yeah.\n\n541\n00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,250\n>> 422.\n\n542\n00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:23,830\n>> 422.\n\n543\n00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:27,760\nSo again Telnet application layer,\nlayer seven and\n\n544\n00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,900\njust remember SSH, not SSL,\nwe'll talk about that in a second.\n\n545\n00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,160\nSSH is gonna be transport [CROSSTALK]\n>> I don't remember if I said it.\n\n546\n00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,560\nSSH being secure shell.\n\n547\n00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,610\n>> Secure shell, yep.\n\n548\n00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,490\nThat's right.\n\n549\n00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,531\n>> [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] Nice to know\nwhat these acronyms actually stand for.\n\n550\n00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:40,613\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n551\n00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,620\nAll right, so let's see.\n\n552\n00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,440\nLet's move onto oh, one of my favorites.\n\n553\n00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,990\nWe're gonna jump all the way to DNS?\n\n554\n00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:46,950\n>> Oh, man.\n>> Believe it or not,\n\n555\n00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,930\nmaybe we should have put these in a little\nbit of order if we're lying on CompTIA,\n\n556\n00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,500\nbut yeah.\n\n557\n00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,610\nDNS is a protocol where we've covered\nthis extensively in our Windows classes,\n\n558\n00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:00,920\nso if you wanna check out some detail\non DNS, check out our Windows episodes.\n\n559\n00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:06,460\nBut DNS, Domain Name System, is what gives\nus the ability to resolve host names or\n\n560\n00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,510\nfully qualified domain\nnames into IP addresses.\n\n561\n00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,670\nWe've talked before,\ncomputers cannot connect to names.\n\n562\n00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,398\nThey can only connect to IP addresses.\n\n563\n00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:15,860\nAs humans, we like to use names.\n\n564\n00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,770\nNames are easier for us to remember.\n\n565\n00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:21,570\nI was telling somebody the other day, if I\nlost my phone, I could not call my father.\n\n566\n00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,640\nYou know, or anybody in my family for that\nmatter, because I look up their name in my\n\n567\n00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,650\ncontact, I touch it, and\nthe phone knows what their number is.\n\n568\n00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:31,395\nIt's the same thing here, I type Newegg\ninto my computer, it goes out and\n\n569\n00:26:31,395 --> 00:26:35,830\ntalks to the DNS servers, and it resolves\nthose names back into an IP address so\n\n570\n00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,680\nthat my computer can then\nconnect to those web servers.\n\n571\n00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,710\nThat goes to report 53 for DNS.\n\n572\n00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:46,320\nAnd I was trying to think about\nwhat else we wanna say about it.\n\n573\n00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,281\nI could talk for hours about DNS.\n\n574\n00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:47,865\n>> Yes.\n\n575\n00:26:47,865 --> 00:26:50,116\n[LAUGH]\n>> But as far as vulnerabilities go and\n\n576\n00:26:50,116 --> 00:26:53,577\nwhere I'm going to implement these guys,\nheck, DNS,\n\n577\n00:26:53,577 --> 00:26:58,380\nI mean you always have to have name\nresolution unless you do everything by IP.\n\n578\n00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,530\n>> And\nit's a fairly open nature protocol, too.\n\n579\n00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:05,010\nWhen you look at it,\nyou'll see that Mike talks about port 53,\n\n580\n00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,180\nbut it's got a TCP port,\nand it's got a UDP port.\n\n581\n00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,720\nIf it's the web browser\ngoing out to New Egg.\n\n582\n00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,940\nIt's probably gonna be a UDP port because\nyou just need an answer to come back.\n\n583\n00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,850\nYou don't really care where\nthat answer comes back.\n\n584\n00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,050\nIt's not time sensitive.\n\n585\n00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,680\nYou just wanna get your answer back\nwhen you question a DNS server.\n\n586\n00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,858\nBut then when you got two DNS servers\ntalking together, they might do things\n\n587\n00:27:23,858 --> 00:27:28,650\nlike, going back into Mike Shaw realm,\nlike some kinda zone transfer.\n\n588\n00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,690\nAnd you want that information to stay\nconsistent, so you do want a connection\n\n589\n00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,585\noriented service when two of those\nguys gotta talk together I believe.\n\n590\n00:27:34,585 --> 00:27:35,150\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n591\n00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,980\nAnd DNS is an open standard.\n\n592\n00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,590\nSo Microsoft, they happened to call\ntheirs DNS, domain name system.\n\n593\n00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,910\n>> Bind.\n\n594\n00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,790\n>> We've got Bind.\n\n595\n00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,963\n>> Bind.\n>> [INAUDIBLE] internet name daemon.\n\n596\n00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:45,570\n>> Sure, sure.\n\n597\n00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,050\n>> It's not just a Microsoft thing.\n\n598\n00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,630\nIn fact, most of the DNS servers\nyou see out on the internet\n\n599\n00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,088\nare probably not running Windows.\n\n600\n00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:53,960\n[LAUGH] Internally we will most likely.\n\n601\n00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,865\n>> Good point.\n\n602\n00:27:54,865 --> 00:27:57,168\n>> And most of the time we\nare running our our server operator,\n\n603\n00:27:57,168 --> 00:27:58,700\nour Windows Server operating system.\n\n604\n00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,410\n>> We've got DNS.\n\n605\n00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,930\nHTTP.\nI think we probably all know HTTP,\n\n606\n00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,490\nmy hyper text transfer protocol,\nall right.\n\n607\n00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:11,080\nThat's what we use to connect\nto those web pages out there.\n\n608\n00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:17,590\nIt send those text based and graphic based\npages back and forth across the web.\n\n609\n00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,140\nPort number of our HTTP?\n\n610\n00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:19,920\n>> Is port 80.\n\n611\n00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,710\n>> Port 80.\n\n612\n00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:24,660\n>> And this again is a relatively\nopen type of communication protocol.\n\n613\n00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:29,180\nIt's a request response, so you gotta\nbe careful with it because you can\n\n614\n00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:34,120\nrequest maybe the wrong resources off the\nwrong server, and it's very easy for them\n\n615\n00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,630\njust to deliver back to your web client,\nthe web browser that you use whether it be\n\n616\n00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:43,220\nthe IE, or Chrome, or Opera, Safari or any\nof those Firefox, can't forget that one.\n\n617\n00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,400\nIt can deliver that data right back to\nthe web browser and if you're not careful,\n\n618\n00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:52,160\nit can deliver the wrong data, and\nyou get viruses or any kind of malware.\n\n619\n00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,160\n>> Right, cuz now HTTP is a plain text\nprotocol as well, so any data that's being\n\n620\n00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,880\nsent back and forth, and normally,\nyou know, I'm not concerned with.\n\n621\n00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,090\nIf I'm surfing the internet,\nI'm reading some blog,\n\n622\n00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:05,910\nI'm checking out New Egg's latest\ndeals on their solid state drives or\n\n623\n00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,030\nsomething like that,\nI'm not too concerned with it.\n\n624\n00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,150\nNow, when I go to put my credit\ncard number in there and\n\n625\n00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:15,300\nbuy that solid state drive,\nthat's when I get concerned with it.\n\n626\n00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,280\nAnd, we have protocols to deal with that,\nand\n\n627\n00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,400\nwe're going to hit those when we get back.\n\n628\n00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,060\n>> Sounds good.\n\n629\n00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,450\nYes, sir.\n>> We are running out of time for\n\n630\n00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,170\nthis little segment.\n\n631\n00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,012\nSo, I'll tell you what.\n\n632\n00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:25,650\nWe're gonna take a quick break and we will\ncome back here in about five minutes or so\n\n633\n00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,753\nand we will keep on going\nwith our protocols and ports.\n\n634\n00:29:29,753 --> 00:29:31,187\n>> Protocols and ports man.\n\n635\n00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:32,740\n>> All right, see you back here in a few.\n\n636\n00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:39,740\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n637\n00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,491\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n638\n00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:46,390\nWe left off with our break talking\nabout some of the different protocols.\n\n639\n00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:49,580\nIn particular we were talking\nabout good old HTTP or\n\n640\n00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,340\nhyper text transfer protocol being\na protocol that goes across the board.\n\n641\n00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,560\nAnything that we use to connect\nto all those web pages.\n\n642\n00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,870\nSo I guess a good segue from\nthat one might be HTTPS, right?\n\n643\n00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:03,710\n>> Hypertext transfer protocol\nover secure socket layer.\n\n644\n00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,710\nDon't try to say that ten times fast.\n\n645\n00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:09,150\nTypically just called HTPS and\nmaybe if you're an over achiever, HTTP.\n\n646\n00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,190\nYeah, exactly.\n\n647\n00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,460\nAnd I know you guys\nhave all used it right?\n\n648\n00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,280\nYou've connected to a web page to do some,\nsome online shopping,\n\n649\n00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,100\nto do some banking, just through most\nof your log in pages should be, and\n\n650\n00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,045\nhopefully we check for that.\n\n651\n00:30:21,045 --> 00:30:24,620\nIs that we're using some kind of secure\nprotocol, because that's, we said\n\n652\n00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:29,840\nbefore the break, HTTP is an unsecured\nprotocol, in other words it's plain text.\n\n653\n00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,840\nSo if I'm going to go\nto login to an account,\n\n654\n00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,060\nI'm going to be transmitting that data\nover the internet out there in the public\n\n655\n00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:39,420\nnetwork, I wanna make sure\nthat information is safe.\n\n656\n00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,720\nSame thing when I do my online banking.\n\n657\n00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,880\nI don't want to transmit that\ndata across the internet and\n\n658\n00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,370\nhave the chance that somebody\ncould see it, so you make sure.\n\n659\n00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,440\nMost browsers, for\n\n660\n00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,870\nexample, give you some kinda indication\nas that you're in a secure session.\n\n661\n00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:56,340\nLike Internet Explorer, for example, turns\nthe address bar green to let you know.\n\n662\n00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:00,360\nOr red if it's a failed attempt or\nif you can't trust the certificate.\n\n663\n00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,510\nAnd we get into certificates and all that\na little bit later on in this class,\n\n664\n00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,620\nas well as some of our Windows episodes.\n\n665\n00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:10,790\nBut HTTPS is taking advantage of,\nit's gonna report 443.\n\n666\n00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,310\n>> Port 443, yep.\n\n667\n00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,070\nYes, sir.\n\n668\n00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,900\n>> And it's gonna be going, and\nwhat it's doing is you're using\n\n669\n00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,500\nthe server that you're connecting to, is\ngonna be asked to presented a certificate.\n\n670\n00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,930\nSo when I connect to Bank of America,\nmy computer is saying, hey,\n\n671\n00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:26,940\nBank of America, prove to me who you\nare and let's set up a secure connection.\n\n672\n00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,790\nAnd so Bank of America is responding.\n\n673\n00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,640\nTheir web server sends back\nthe certificate that's been issued to\n\n674\n00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,760\nthat server.\n\n675\n00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,650\nThat certificate allows me to\nverify the identity of the server.\n\n676\n00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:41,260\nTo make sure that I'm actually talking\nto Bank of America's web server.\n\n677\n00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:45,820\nAnd then in that certificate is\nBank of America's public key.\n\n678\n00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,875\nAnd they have\nthe corresponding private key.\n\n679\n00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:50,038\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngoing to generate, on my end,\n\n680\n00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:52,042\nI'm gonna generate what's\ncalled a symmetric key.\n\n681\n00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:54,000\nIt's a session key that we're gonna use.\n\n682\n00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,129\nAnd then I'm going to take Bank\nof America's public key and\n\n683\n00:31:57,129 --> 00:32:00,330\nI'm going to use that to\nencrypt that session key.\n\n684\n00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:05,000\nNow I can send that session key, a copy\nof it, back over to Bank of America.\n\n685\n00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,200\nBank of America has\nthe corresponding private key,\n\n686\n00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,380\nwhich is going to allow\nthem to decrypt that.\n\n687\n00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,760\nAnd now we both have a copy\nof that same session key and\n\n688\n00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,720\nI didn't have to worry about anybody\nin between us intercepting that key\n\n689\n00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,640\nbecause Bank of America's the only one\nwith the corresponding private key\n\n690\n00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,450\nthat could decrypt in the first place.\n\n691\n00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:24,920\nNow that we both have a copy of that key,\nwe can encrypt traffic and\n\n692\n00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,900\nwe can send that data back and forth.\n\n693\n00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,040\nAnd we talked about IPsec earlier\ncuz why don't we use IPsec?\n\n694\n00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,445\nIt's a good security protocol.\n\n695\n00:32:31,445 --> 00:32:33,870\n>> Mm-hm\n>> But if you remember what we said,\n\n696\n00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,350\nboth ends have to be set up to use IPsec.\n\n697\n00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,905\nAnd they have to have policies that agree.\n\n698\n00:32:38,905 --> 00:32:39,500\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n699\n00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,270\n>> And I don't know what Bank\nof America's using, right?\n\n700\n00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,830\nThey can't reach out to\nall their customers.\n\n701\n00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,110\nWhen I go to Newegg,\ndifferent policies, whatever.\n\n702\n00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,580\nSo something like IPsec\nisn't gonna work very well.\n\n703\n00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,720\nWhere you've gotta have all the,\nnot the general public, but\n\n704\n00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,162\nyour customers connecting\nfrom their home machines.\n\n705\n00:32:53,162 --> 00:32:54,680\n>> Mm-hm.\nWhereas SSH or HTTPS,\n\n706\n00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,140\nmy computer doesn't have to be setup for\nit.\n\n707\n00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,240\nThe Bank of America's webserver's\ngiving me everything I need\n\n708\n00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,050\nto set up this secure channel.\n\n709\n00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,920\n>> Yeah, and when, like you're talking\nabout with the symmetric key encryption,\n\n710\n00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,060\nfirst of all, it's really cool how\nyou can publicly share a secret.\n\n711\n00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,385\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That's really neat.\n\n712\n00:33:11,385 --> 00:33:12,064\n>> Right?\n>> And then,\n\n713\n00:33:12,064 --> 00:33:15,630\nwe use the symmetric key encryption too,\ncuz IPsec is very computational heavy.\n\n714\n00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,870\nWhen you're encrypting information,\nyou got these endpoints, like routers and\n\n715\n00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:21,000\nstuff, and they've gotta unencapsulate.\n\n716\n00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,090\nThey gotta remove all that encapsulation.\n\n717\n00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,570\nIf you think about it,\n\n718\n00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:28,165\nhow long to you wanna spend on a secure\nwebsite if you're gonna buy something?\n\n719\n00:33:28,165 --> 00:33:28,730\n>> Mm-hm, not long.\n\n720\n00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:30,220\n>> No.\nIf it looks like dial-up, and\n\n721\n00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,155\nwhen it loads, I'm gone.\n\n722\n00:33:32,155 --> 00:33:33,110\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n723\n00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:37,690\n>> So the ability to publicly share\na secret on top of it, that secret that\n\n724\n00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:41,310\nyou're sharing is very streamlined,\nvery easy to encrypt and decrypt.\n\n725\n00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,380\nAlso keeps the performance\nof the communications up,\n\n726\n00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,040\nwhich is really what we want.\n\n727\n00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,450\nReally relies on a world wide trust model.\n\n728\n00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:52,970\nAnd it's responsible for\nsecuring our e-commerce worldwide.\n\n729\n00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,050\n>> Right, absolutely.\n\n730\n00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:56,560\nWithout HTTPS,\nwe wouldn't have e-commerce.\n\n731\n00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,570\n>> Sure, yeah, definitely.\n\n732\n00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:02,180\nAnd that really brings us into something\nlike SSL, Secure Socket Layer,\n\n733\n00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,270\nin that the whole process\nis pretty much the same.\n\n734\n00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:08,330\nIt just depends on what application\nlayer protocol is what you're\n\n735\n00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:12,660\nusing to transfer that data or\nto move that data into the network.\n\n736\n00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:17,880\n>> And that's really what HTTPS is, right,\nis HTTP combined with Secure Socket Layer.\n\n737\n00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,940\nNow, it's not our only choice.\n\n738\n00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,070\nWe've got,\nwithin the last couple years or so we've,\n\n739\n00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,590\nwell, probably a little longer than that.\n\n740\n00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,230\n>> Yeah, sure.\n>> We've got another protocol we\n\n741\n00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,540\nuse which is Transport Layer Security.\n\n742\n00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,480\n>> That's right.\n\n743\n00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,185\n>> Or TLS.\n\n744\n00:34:28,185 --> 00:34:28,960\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n745\n00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,470\n>> Which is also HTTPS.\n\n746\n00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:32,860\nKinda strange, but\nit does fall under HTTPS.\n\n747\n00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,340\nAnd the important thing to understand\nhere is they work almost the same.\n\n748\n00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,190\n>> Yep.\n>> I mean, they're very similar in the way\n\n749\n00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:38,720\nthey function.\n\n750\n00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,240\nSame thing with the certificate and\ncreating that session key.\n\n751\n00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,750\nGetting that session key securely to\nthe other end of the conversation so\n\n752\n00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,140\nwe can encrypt our communications.\n\n753\n00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:50,610\nThe important thing to understand?\n\n754\n00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,270\nNot compatible.\n\n755\n00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,470\n>> That's very true.\n\n756\n00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,680\n>> If one end is speaking SSL.\n\n757\n00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,240\n>> Yep.\n>> And\n\n758\n00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,475\nthe other end is speaking TLS,\nthey cannot negotiate security.\n\n759\n00:34:57,475 --> 00:35:01,580\nIt's two different languages, so\nboth ends are either doing SSL or\n\n760\n00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,850\nboth ends are doing TLS,\nnot one and the other.\n\n761\n00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:07,315\n>> I remember as\nthe student studying these-\n\n762\n00:35:07,315 --> 00:35:08,010\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n763\n00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:08,715\n>> Protocols.\n\n764\n00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:13,010\nThe most confusing thing was\nthe fact that when you look up\n\n765\n00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:13,870\nSSL-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n766\n00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,070\n>> You would also get\n\n767\n00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,020\nresults back for TLS.\n\n768\n00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:16,560\n>> For TLS, right.\n>> And\n\n769\n00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,575\nthat's because they are very similar.\n\n770\n00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:21,440\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> In fact, TLS is based off of the SSL\n\n771\n00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,565\nunderlying architecture.\n\n772\n00:35:22,565 --> 00:35:23,480\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But it doesn't allow for\n\n773\n00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,110\nthat negotiation of a weaker cipher suite.\n\n774\n00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:32,820\nSo, for instance, SSL,\nmaybe the server supports 3.0, but your\n\n775\n00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,840\nbrowser says I'm sorry, I don't understand\nthose higher level of encryptions.\n\n776\n00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,960\nAnd depending if it's set up that way,\nthe server can say, okay,\n\n777\n00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,980\nwe're gonna go 2.0,\nwe'll let this communication happen.\n\n778\n00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,820\nTLS says no.\n\n779\n00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,500\nYou get on board with\nthe encryption we have,\n\n780\n00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,760\nor we're gonna just\nterminate the communication.\n\n781\n00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,990\nAnd it's used for other things that we'll\nalso talk about in other episodes, and\n\n782\n00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:55,040\nI know they probably mention it pretty\nheavy in things like Cisco and stuff,\n\n783\n00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,820\ncuz it also allows for certificate\nbased authentication and stuff.\n\n784\n00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:03,885\nIt's essentially allowing\nus to encapsulate\n\n785\n00:36:03,885 --> 00:36:08,430\nHTTP traffic layer seven\nof the application layer,\n\n786\n00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:13,290\nHTTP and then SSL and\nTLS are session layer.\n\n787\n00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,340\nSession layer communication or protocol.\n\n788\n00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,380\nExcuse me.\n\n789\n00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,560\nExactly.\nAnd that goes over to port 443.\n\n790\n00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,420\nSo if we need to open up in our\nfirewall that would be the port\n\n791\n00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,830\nwe would want to open.\n\n792\n00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,800\nSo that covers that.\n\n793\n00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,660\nLet's do FTP.\n\n794\n00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,510\nWe haven't talked about good old FTP yet.\n\n795\n00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,140\n>> Okay.\n>> One of the older protocols we have\n\n796\n00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:29,800\non the list, I think.\n\n797\n00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,341\n>> It's a very old protocol.\n\n798\n00:36:31,341 --> 00:36:35,137\nAnd it's interesting that it\nwas around before HTTP and\n\n799\n00:36:35,137 --> 00:36:39,912\nthe brief successor to HTTP was Gopher,\nhere today, gone tomorrow.\n\n800\n00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,570\nFTP is really interesting because\nif you look at some of the old\n\n801\n00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:48,180\nhistorical videos and stuff when they are\nreally starting networking communications,\n\n802\n00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,240\nyou can see them drafting out standards\nand what they're going to use and\n\n803\n00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,560\nwhat cables and\nyou see FTP back there on the wall.\n\n804\n00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,990\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's from the 70s so\n\n805\n00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,810\nit's been around for a very long time.\n\n806\n00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,940\n>> File transfer protocol,\nits got a couple of ports now.\n\n807\n00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,530\nYou have 420 is where your data\nis transferred across, but then\n\n808\n00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:07,410\nwhen you issue commands to a FTP server,\nthat's gonna go over 421, I believe.\n\n809\n00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:09,900\nBut we also have a problem with\nFTP just like we have with HTTP.\n\n810\n00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,850\n>> We do!\nBecause it was developed so long ago,\n\n811\n00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:15,410\nit was really before security\nwas a major concern.\n\n812\n00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,360\nRight?\n>> Yeah, it's not like we didn't\n\n813\n00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,160\nthink about security at all, but\nthey weren't all that worried about it.\n\n814\n00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,180\nAnd it's a very efficient protocol for\nwhat it does.\n\n815\n00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,800\nThe name, Fire Transfer Protocol.\n\n816\n00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,810\n>> Yep.\n>> It was developed\n\n817\n00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,350\nto transfer files across\nour ethernet based

00:37:33,440\n>> Yep.\n>> All plain text.\n\n821\n00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,700\nAnd not as efficient at moving\ngraphics and things like that,\n\n822\n00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,900\nwhich is why the big shift.\n\n823\n00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,640\nEventually when when the web\nbecame more graphic-oriented.\n\n824\n00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,746\n>> Media [CROSSTALK].\n\n825\n00:37:42,746 -->

--> 00:37:52,880\nAnd it's gonna be much faster to\ntransfer a driver down using FTP\n\n828\n00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,630\nthan it would with HTTP because of\nthe overhead involved in that protocol.\n\n829\n00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:00,360\nOf course, now browsing their FTP\nserver's not nearly as nice, right?\n\n830\n00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,700\nBecause in the HTTP,\nI've got drop down lists.\n\n831\n00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,120\n>> Yes.\n>> I gotta get a little pictures,\n\n832\n00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,200\nI can click on the device.\n\n833\n00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,970\nI'm like, I'm looking for a driver for\none of those things, right?\n\n834\n00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,060\n>> Yea.\n>> FTP, it's a list.\n\n835\n00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,800\n>> We call it client-based flair.\n\n836\n00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,094\n>> [LAUGH] You know, and their drivers\nare all named like RO362544 blah, blah,\n\n837\n00:38:15,094 --> 00:38:15,700\nblah, blah,

card.\n\n840\n00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,135\nYou know, so you've got to know\nexactly what you're looking for.\n\n841\n00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,310\nBut for transferring files around.\n\n842\n00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:27,810\n>> Highly optimized.\n\n843\n00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,314\n>> Still used.\n\n844\n00:38:29,314 --> 00:38:32,985\nBut, as Wes pointed out, it's not

in most places we're\ngonna wanna make sure we get,\n\n850\n00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,270\nwe authenticate the people that\nare getting connected to that server.\n\n851\n00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:48,125\nAnd the problem is that username and\npassword is gonna be plain text.\n\n852\n00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:48,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n853\n00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,040\n>> And then what happens is my users\nuse the same password for everything.\n\n854\n00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:56,310\nSo if I can see you connecting to that\nFTP server, I now have your password.\n\n855\n00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,670\nAnd you know what I'm gonna try next?\n\n856\n00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:00,230\nWhat if I could log onto his work\ncomputer using that same password?\n\n857\n00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,030\n>> Right.\n>> Let me see if I can\n\n858\n00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,190\nconnect to his bank account\nwith that same password, right?\n\n859\n00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:04,970\nSo what do we do?\n\n860\n00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:08,710\nWell, just like we do with HTTP,\nwe put an S on it.\n\n861\n00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,800\nYeah, that's right, that's right.\n\n862\n00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,890\nWe add the S to everything.\n\n863\n00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,140\nLike I say, if you add an S,\n\n864\n00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,820\njust like anything that's blue,\nit either is secure or performs better.\n\n865\n00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,885\n>> That's right.\n\n866\n00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:16,414\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n867\n00:39:16,414 --> 00:39:20,040\nwe encapsulate it from the application\nlayer down at that session layer again.\n\n868\n00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,175\nWe end up encapsulating it over SS.\n\n869\n00:39:23,175 --> 00:39:24,918\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Almost gonna say SSH so,\n\n870\n00:39:24,918 --> 00:39:26,419\nSSL Secure Socket Layer.\n\n871\n00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:29,420\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> And it allows us now the ability to\n\n872\n00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:35,445\nsecure that information and still use some\nof those common, almost like web browsing.\n\n873\n00:39:35,445 --> 00:39:36,290\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n874\n00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,940\n>> Clients and\nstuff to be able to see that information.\n\n875\n00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,448\nYeah, and there was two,\nand a little confusing,\n\n876\n00:39:40,448 --> 00:39:41,792\nwe were talking about that earlier, right?\n\n877\n00:39:41,792 --> 00:39:42,894\nBecause SFTP,\n\n878\n00:39:42,894 --> 00:39:48,251\nthat's the first time which I think it\nwas originally tried to secure FTP.\n\n879\n00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:51,833\nIt was called\nSimple File Transfer Protocol Secure?\n\n880\n00:39:51,833 --> 00:39:53,167\nSimple file, SMTP.\n\n881\n00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:55,751\nSimple file transfer protocol.\n\n882\n00:39:55,751 --> 00:39:57,870\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Was the predecessor of FTP.\n\n883\n00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,470\n>> Yep.\n\n884\n00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,610\n>> That was the predecessor.\n\n885\n00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,470\nObsolete now.\n\n886\n00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:03,180\n>> FIle transfer protocol secure\nis what I was trying to say.\n\n887\n00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:03,920\n>> Yes, that's it.\n\n888\n00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,025\n>> Which is, as you said,\nusing SSL to protect that data.\n\n889\n00:40:07,025 --> 00:40:07,670\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n890\n00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:11,140\n>> And then we also have or\na secure shell option.\n\n891\n00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,740\n>> Yeah, and there's a good comparison\nwith another protocol that's in here.\n\n892\n00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:21,060\nWhen we talk about SSH to securely\ntransmit files over FTTP,\n\n893\n00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:25,300\nwell, we've also got secure copy protocol,\nSCP, that's on the list here.\n\n894\n00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,290\nAnd SCP is something\nthat's very minimalistic.\n\n895\n00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:32,820\nIt doesn't understand commands,\nyou can't issue commands against it.\n\n896\n00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:36,530\nSo it's very simplistic and\nit's only for file transfer\n\n897\n00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,220\n>> Right, right.\n\n898\n00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,870\n>> And that's all you can do.\n\n899\n00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,520\nYou can't issue commands\nlike you can in FTP\n\n900\n00:40:41,520 -->

initiating\n\n913\n00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:13,760\nthe same type of shell that we would to\nconfigure these connectivity devices, but\n\n914\n00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,590\nthe difference is now we're connecting\nto an FTP server, and over SSH we're\n\n915\n00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:23,130\ntransferring that information securely and\nwe still get the traditional FTP command\n\n916\n00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:26,300\nset where we can issue commands, which\nyou don't get in secure copy protocol.\n\n917\n00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:26,880\n>> Right.\n\n918\n00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,630\nExactly so, just to make sure\nwe got all those right, so FTP.\n\n919\n00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,170\n>> S.\n>> S,\n\n920\n00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:36,040\nis by FTP\n>> Secure which uses SSL.\n\n921\n00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:36,540\n>> That's right.\n\n922\n00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,660\n>> And then you've got FTP over SSH, or\n\n923\n00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:44,270\nSecure FTP where the S is in front where\nyou're using Secure Shell to protect it.\n\n924\n00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:44,880\n>> That's right, yep.\n\n925\n00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,500\nThat's right.\n\n926\n00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,400\n>> So the S is the front, SSH.\n\n927\n00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,935\nThe S at the end, SSL or even TLS now.\n\n928\n00:41:49,935 --> 00:41:50,710\n>> Mm-hm.\nYep.\n\n929\n00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,440\n>> For

--> 00:42:01,660\nin an application protocol, then you've\ngot two different layers of the OSI model,\n\n933\n00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:05,510\nyou've got layer seven where FTP,\nHTTP all sit, and\n\n934\n00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:11,250\nthen you've got what layer\nfive is where Secure Shell.\n\n935\n00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,365\nThese SSL,\nsecure socket layered DLS

Yes.\n>> We did mention, and\n\n939\n00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,030\nI brought up the SFTP-\n>> Yes.\n\n940\n00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,160\n>> A little bit beforehand,\nbefore we were ready for it,

[LAUGH] >> [LAUGH]\n>> Pretty much considered obsolete.\n\n947\n00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,910\nAnd then right along those same lines\nwe have trivial file transfer protocol.\n\n948\n00:42:40,910 -->

00:44:08,155\nBut anyway, so you guys need to\nknow what it is, but it is dying.\n\n986\n00:44:08,155 --> 00:44:09,700\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> NetBIOS was an older\n\n987\n00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,640\nnaming resolution protocol.\n\n988\n00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,535\nIt was a very simplistic naming process,\nit was what we call a flat structure.\n\n989\n00:44:15,535 --> 00:44:17,450\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> No hierarchy to it,\n\n990\n00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:21,300\nlimited to 16 characters, and\none of the characters was reserved for\n\n991\n00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,600\ndenoting the service\nthe machine was offering.\n\n992\n00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,380\nSo you really only got 15 characters,\nand what we need to know about it,\n\n993\n00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:31,920\nit's a non-routable naming\nresolution protocol,\n\n994\n00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,970\nthat relies heavily on\nbroadcast to name resolutions.\n\n995\n00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:35,490\n>> Sure.\n\n996\n00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:37,290\nSure.\n>> I don't even want to mention the word\n\n997\n00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:39,920\nwins in here, but-\n>> I'd love the name of wins.\n\n998\n00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,540\nWe've gotta mention it.\n\n999\n00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:45,380\nIt's the Windows internet naming service\nthat you can't use on the internet.\n\n1000\n00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,890\n>> Right, it's, exactly,\nit's only used internally.\n\n1001\n00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:52,870\nIt's not hierarchical like DNS is, so\nit's not gonna work with the Internet.\n\n1002\n00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:54,400\n>> That's right.\n>> And the growth of the Internet and\n\n1003\n00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:54,900\nall that.\n\n1004\n00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,590\nAnd the number of nodes\nthat we have out there.\n\n1005\n00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:59,520\n>> And I believe when you\nfirst look at it, it was for\n\n1006\n00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,425\ntwo network aware applications\nrunning on a computer.\n\n1007\n00:45:02,425 --> 00:45:03,240\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> For them to be able to\n\n1008\n00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,980\nfind each other out over the network.\n\n1009\n00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,310\nFind those services that you mentioned and\nbe able to communicate.\n\n1010\n00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:13,220\nIt's a session layer protocol but\nit's commonly implemented over TCPIP and\n\n1011\n00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,840\nthat's NBT if you will, NetBios over TCPI,\nand in fact you guys see it,\n\n1012\n00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,705\nwe talked about in some of the other\nepisodes how you can see that local\n\n1013\n00:45:20,705 --> 00:45:25,860\nNetBIOS name table through NBT stat,\nwhich is again, you know,\n\n1014\n00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:30,270\na utility that's built into Windows\nthere That you can see those names and\n\n1015\n00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:35,030\nsome of those service codes that\nyou can't see anywhere else.\n\n1016\n00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:37,900\n>> Windows 98 and prior,\nWindows 98, Windows 95,\n\n1017\n00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,374\nthey relied heavily on NetBIOS.\n\n1018\n00:45:39,374 --> 00:45:41,325\nAnd back when we had\nthe network neighborhood.\n\n1019\n00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:43,260\n>> Yeah.\n>> The little icon you can click on.\n\n1020\n00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,480\nThings like that.\n\n1021\n00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,870\nIt's not really used anymore.\n\n1022\n00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:49,052\nIn fact, starting with Vista and\nlater, we've got the link-local,\n\n1023\n00:45:49,052 --> 00:45:50,021\nmulti cache namers.\n\n1024\n00:45:50,021 --> 00:45:51,660\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> That's right.\n\n1025\n00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,410\n>> That accomplishes the same thing.\n\n1026\n00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:56,620\nResolving names locally,\non your local link, but\n\n1027\n00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,580\nthat uses multicast rather than broadcast,\nso a little more efficient.\n\n1028\n00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,282\n>> Not saturating your network\nwith unnecessary traffic.\n\n1029\n00:46:02,282 --> 00:46:02,843\n>> Exactly.\n\n1030\n00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,450\n>> Sure.\n>> And everything is DNS now.\n\n1031\n00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:08,925\nThe internet is DNS, most operating\nsystem, Apple, all of them use DNS.\n\n1032\n00:46:08,925 --> 00:46:10,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So we don't really need\n\n1033\n00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:11,550\na second naming protocol.\n\n1034\n00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:12,090\nYou know?\n>> Right.\n\n1035\n00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:13,890\n>> So it's fading.\n\n1036\n00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:15,060\nAnd, yeah.\n\n1037\n00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,130\nYou can turn it off, and\nyou can get away with it.\n\n1038\n00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:19,920\nUnless you've got a Windows\n98 box sitting around.\n\n1039\n00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,781\n>> So in 2017 we'll come back and\nwe'll tell Mike, it's still going on.\n\n1040\n00:46:22,781 --> 00:46:23,617\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's still there.\n\n1041\n00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:25,466\nIt's still got that little check\nmark that I've gotta turn off.\n\n1042\n00:46:25,466 --> 00:46:26,530\n[LAUGH] Gosh darnit.\n\n1043\n00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:28,820\n>> I remember back in 2014, right?\n\n1044\n00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,280\nDangnabbit.\n\n1045\n00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,700\n>> Yeah, so session layer, by the way,\n\n1046\n00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:35,150\nagain, NetBIOS will give you a session\nlayer protocol, so keep that in mind and\n\n1047\n00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:38,235\nlike I said, even though session layer\nprotocol, it's typically encapsulated over\n\n1048\n00:46:38,235 --> 00:46:43,040\nTCP/IP or TCP if you will, so\nyou might see it sitting at\n\n1049\n00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,110\nportions of the session layer as well\nas fortunes of the transport layer,\n\n1050\n00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:49,490\nbut primarily net bios by itself\nis a session layer protocol.\n\n1051\n00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:51,230\n>> Right.\n\n1052\n00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:54,060\nAlright, how about some fiber.\n\n1053\n00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,590\n>> Fiber.\n>> Paul's ready for some fiber right now.\n\n1054\n00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:56,565\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n1055\n00:46:56,565 --> 00:46:59,350\nAll this is some fiber\nchannel; you out there, bud?\n\n1056\n00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:01,970\n>> Yea, we've got fiber channel and\nthen fiber channel over ethernet, right?\n\n1057\n00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:02,470\n>> Yes.\n\n1058\n00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:03,060\nYep.\n\n1059\n00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:06,580\n>> And again, another one of those things\nthat we really hit pretty good in,\n\n1060\n00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:10,060\nI think, in our network plus episode\nwhere we talked a little about fiber,\n\n1061\n00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,103\ndifferent medium.\n\n1062\n00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,892\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right.\n\n1063\n00:47:11,892 --> 00:47:17,120\nInstead of using copper wire to transmit\nthose electrons back and forth...\n\n1064\n00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,155\n>> Use fiber one.\n\n1065\n00:47:18,155 --> 00:47:20,330\n[LAUGH].\n>> FIber one, the Metamucil.\n\n1066\n00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:24,200\nWe're going to be using fiber,\nwhich is uses light,\n\n1067\n00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,738\nlaser or LEDs primarily, now a days.\n\n1068\n00:47:27,738 --> 00:47:28,306\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1069\n00:47:28,306 --> 00:47:29,070\n>> Very fast.\n\n1070\n00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:29,570\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n1071\n00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:30,350\nI mean, one of the beautiful\n\n1072\n00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,530\nthings about fiber is very fast.\n\n1073\n00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:37,350\nIt's not that susceptible to interference\nat least not EMI or anything like that.\n\n1074\n00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:39,280\nMaybe a little more fragile.\n\n1075\n00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:39,920\n>> Yeah.\n\n1076\n00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,250\n>> But you see this used a lot\nin your storage networks, right?\n\n1077\n00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,459\nI mean, where I need that incredibly fast,\n\n1078\n00:47:44,459 --> 00:47:46,917\nI can take advantage of\nthat speed that I can get.\n\n1079\n00:47:46,917 --> 00:47:47,526\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n1080\n00:47:47,526 --> 00:47:51,576\nwhen I've got multiple servers hitting\nthat Saying I need that throughput\n\n1081\n00:47:51,576 --> 00:47:53,000\nthat I can get from fiber.\n\n1082\n00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,205\nTypically don't see it run out to\nthe end station, the workstations or\n\n1083\n00:47:57,205 --> 00:48:01,703\nthings like that because it is fragile and\nit's not as cheap as Ethernet is.\n\n1084\n00:48:01,703 --> 00:48:06,293\n>> Yeah and talking to some of the other\nguys before, we come up on stages,\n\n1085\n00:48:06,293 --> 00:48:10,131\nthat it's hundreds of thousands\nof dollars that could be.\n\n1086\n00:48:10,131 --> 00:48:14,255\nAll right, these storage arrays and fiber\nchannels, yes they offer fast throughput,\n\n1087\n00:48:14,255 --> 00:48:15,488\nfast connection speeds.\n\n1088\n00:48:15,488 --> 00:48:18,333\nAnd another thing is,\nbeing able to connect over fiber,\n\n1089\n00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:22,210\nif you're ten kilometres away\nfrom your storage location.\n\n1090\n00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:26,830\nSo again, very complex yeah,\nbut very, very expensive and\n\n1091\n00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:29,930\nwhen you're talking thousands and\nthousands upon thousands of dollars,\n\n1092\n00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:32,790\njust for the media,\nlet alone a couple $100 thousand for\n\n1093\n00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:36,480\nyour storage array multi-disk systems,\nit can be very expensive.\n\n1094\n00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,545\nAnd some people still maybe have that\nstorage array, we've already got existing\n\n1095\n00:48:40,545 --> 00:48:44,550\nEthernet-based networks that are in place\nthat we're using on our LANs regardless,\n\n1096\n00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:48,460\nso this fiber channel over ethernet\nis an interesting concept.\n\n1097\n00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:49,670\n>> A little poor man's fiber channel.\n\n1098\n00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,410\n>> That's right.\n>> I mean, in a way.\n\n1099\n00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:53,382\nI can't afford to go full fiber but\n\n1100\n00:48:53,382 --> 00:48:56,918\nI still wanna use that efficient\nprotocol to communicate, so\n\n1101\n00:48:56,918 --> 00:49:01,000\nI can take my fiber channel and\nI can dump those commands onto Ethernet.\n\n1102\n00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,970\nStill typically segregated out so\nit's still a storage network.\n\n1103\n00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:08,780\nMy normal mode of communications\nare not on there.\n\n1104\n00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,840\nFull redundancy back\ninto that storage area,\n\n1105\n00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,050\nbecause I need access\nto that data reliable.\n\n1106\n00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,790\nBut yeah,\nFCoE is just Fiber Channel over Ethernet.\n\n1107\n00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:17,710\n>> Sure.\n>> It's what I like to call\n\n1108\n00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:18,888\nthe poor man's fiber.\n\n1109\n00:49:18,888 --> 00:49:21,129\n>> That's right.\nFiber channel uses different identifiers\n\n1110\n00:49:21,129 --> 00:49:25,322\nfor endpoint, so if we wanna go across\nan existing LAN technology without fiber,\n\n1111\n00:49:25,322 --> 00:49:29,640\nwe've gotta use that existing technology\nthat can deliver information to the local\n\n1112\n00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,456\narea network.\n\n1113\n00:49:30,456 --> 00:49:33,899\nAnd that's one of the reasons Ethernet,\nit just takes that fiber channel\n\n1114\n00:49:33,899 --> 00:49:36,955\ncommunication, encapsulates it\nin a Ethernet-based frame and\n\n1115\n00:49:36,955 --> 00:49:39,637\nthen we can use MAC addresses\nto deliver to its endpoint.\n\n1116\n00:49:39,637 --> 00:49:41,345\n>> Right.\n\n1117\n00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:42,634\nAnd then right along those same lines.\n\n1118\n00:49:42,634 --> 00:49:43,608\n>> [LAUGH] Very good, Paul.\nYes, sir.\n\n1119\n00:49:43,608 --> 00:49:44,630\nYes, sir.\n\n1120\n00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:46,145\n>> Tropic Thunder, I'm saying.\n\n1121\n00:49:46,145 --> 00:49:49,128\nAnother one right along\nthe same lines is iSCSI.\n\n1122\n00:49:49,128 --> 00:49:50,055\n>> Yes.\n\n1123\n00:49:50,055 --> 00:49:53,575\n>> Where we're taking our SCSI commands\nand we're putting those over our Ethernet.\n\n1124\n00:49:53,575 --> 00:49:55,550\n>> And now it becomes routable\n>> Exactly.\n\n1125\n00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:56,140\n>> Yep, definitely.\n\n1126\n00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,640\n>> So, we can use that infrastructure that\nmaybe that we already have in place, and\n\n1127\n00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:04,130\nwe can take advantage of those SCSI\ncommands being very efficient,\n\n1128\n00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:07,590\nless overhead than say on a TCPIP,\nstraight up TCPIP.\n\n1129\n00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:10,980\nAnd, as you said, I can go across\na LAN now, all of a sudden.\n\n1130\n00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:15,835\nAnd I can connect that branch office back\nto that SAN, back in my corporate network.\n\n1131\n00:50:15,835 --> 00:50:18,830\n>> Yeah and definitely, and\nnow it makes it routable.\n\n1132\n00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:24,370\n>> On an Ethernet-based link, you're\nlimited to how much distance you have.\n\n1133\n00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:26,770\nWe've talked about in some\nof the other episodes,\n\n1134\n00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:29,710\nespecially on Network Plus I know they\ntalk about it very extensively there\n\n1135\n00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:32,540\nthat you got a 100 meter\nlink maximum on a cable.\n\n1136\n00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,740\nCan you run it farther?\n\n1137\n00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,540\nSure, but\nyour signal's going to attenuate,\n\n1138\n00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:40,450\nso you're limited to how\nlong those links can be\n\n1139\n00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:44,530\nover your ethernet-based communications\nback to that storage array.\n\n1140\n00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:49,150\nSo you can limit, or\nkind of alleviate I guess, free up some of\n\n1141\n00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:53,515\nthat physical media limitation by making\nit routable and implementing it over IP.\n\n1142\n00:50:53,515 --> 00:50:56,450\n>> Now one of the other thing we've gotta\nmention, and this is Security Plus,\n\n1143\n00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:59,310\nif iSCSI is not secure, right?\n\n1144\n00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:02,979\nAnd it is not easy to encrypt that,\nwe can bring IPsec along with it.\n\n1145\n00:51:02,979 --> 00:51:07,501\nWe're gonna take a huge performance hit\nif we start dumping IPsec on top of that\n\n1146\n00:51:07,501 --> 00:51:12,587\nfiber channel, also difficult to implement\nsomething like IPsec over fiber channel.\n\n1147\n00:51:12,587 --> 00:51:16,368\nSwitching over to FCOE is really not gonna\nhelp you because this still has the same\n\n1148\n00:51:16,368 --> 00:51:19,594\nvulnerabilities, whether I'm sending\nit over straight up fiber or\n\n1149\n00:51:19,594 --> 00:51:23,620\nputting it over Ethernet-based networks,\nsame vulnerabilities are gonna exist.\n\n1150\n00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:26,912\nSo something we gotta think about if we\nare going across a public infrastructure,\n\n1151\n00:51:26,912 --> 00:51:30,156\nI gotta figure out how to setup maybe some\nkind of tunnel to protect those commands\n\n1152\n00:51:30,156 --> 00:51:32,373\nand that data that's being sent back and\nforth there.\n\n1153\n00:51:32,373 --> 00:51:35,657\n>> What's kinda interesting, and\nit's not really in the topics here,\n\n1154\n00:51:35,657 --> 00:51:39,333\nis the fact the the IEEE 1394 which we\ncommonly know as marketing names like\n\n1155\n00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:43,140\nFireWire and Sony's iLink, is actually\nyou can connect it to a SCSI backplane.\n\n1156\n00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:47,232\nCuz when they released IEEE 1394,\nagain we commonly know it as FireWire,\n\n1157\n00:51:47,232 --> 00:51:50,656\nis they allow those SCSI command\nsets to go over that serial link.\n\n1158\n00:51:50,656 --> 00:51:54,294\nSo believe it or not,\nFireWire, or IEEE 1394,\n\n1159\n00:51:54,294 --> 00:51:57,617\ndoes have the commands\nin it that support SCSI.\n\n1160\n00:51:57,617 --> 00:51:58,458\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n1161\n00:51:58,458 --> 00:52:05,356\nAll right, I think we've hit everything\nexcept maybe some of our little IPv4,\n\n1162\n00:52:05,356 --> 00:52:09,423\nv6 and some ICMP commands,\nso let's do ICMP.\n\n1163\n00:52:09,423 --> 00:52:10,519\nThat's not a problem, right?\n\n1164\n00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:12,423\nInternet Control Message Protocol?\n\n1165\n00:52:12,423 --> 00:52:14,204\n>> Yes.\n>> Right.\n\n1166\n00:52:14,204 --> 00:52:15,285\nAnd that's all you need to know.\n\n1167\n00:52:15,285 --> 00:52:16,030\n>> Yep.\n>> Just kidding.\n\n1168\n00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:16,775\n>> Class dismissed.\n\n1169\n00:52:16,775 --> 00:52:17,937\n[LAUGH]\n>> You can't really specify a port,\n\n1170\n00:52:17,937 --> 00:52:19,176\nI mean, it uses a few different ports.\n\n1171\n00:52:19,176 --> 00:52:19,763\n>> Yeah.\n\n1172\n00:52:19,763 --> 00:52:22,671\n>> And\nit's a whole [CROSSTALK] slew of commands.\n\n1173\n00:52:22,671 --> 00:52:24,447\n>> No,\nport 9 is where you [CROSSTALK] find LAN.\n\n1174\n00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,530\nWhat's ping?\n\n1175\n00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:27,880\n>> I think the request is 8.\n\n1176\n00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:28,620\n>> Is it 8?\n\n1177\n00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,468\nOkay yeah.\n>> Yeah it could be.\n\n1178\n00:52:29,468 --> 00:52:30,270\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> It's been a little\n\n1179\n00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:32,080\nwhile since I looked up some of those.\n\n1180\n00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,500\nBut ICMP,\nInternet Control Message Protocol,\n\n1181\n00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,640\nthere's actually several different, I\ndon't even know what you wanna call them.\n\n1182\n00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,017\n>> Utilities?\n>> Utilities, yeah, built into that,\n\n1183\n00:52:41,017 --> 00:52:45,107\nlike he mentions ping or echo request, and\nthis is what we learn in network plus and\n\n1184\n00:52:45,107 --> 00:52:46,920\nour basic troubleshooting.\n\n1185\n00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,480\nThis is how I can test or\nverify electrical connectivity.\n\n1186\n00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,100\nCan I talk to that web server?\n\n1187\n00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,420\nIs it responding to its IP address?\n\n1188\n00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,960\nBy default, it sends out those\nfour little echo requests, and\n\n1189\n00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,200\nthen the other end is supposed to reply.\n\n1190\n00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,790\nGives you a little bit\nof speed information,\n\n1191\n00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:04,300\nabout how long it took on that round trip,\nfor that to take place.\n\n1192\n00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:04,960\nSo we can look for\n\n1193\n00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,770\nlatency in routers, we can look for\nproblems connecting the machine.\n\n1194\n00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:12,440\nThey call me up and they say hey,\nI can't connect to the file server.\n\n1195\n00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,000\nWell, I'm the IT guy,\nI know the IP address of the file server,\n\n1196\n00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,300\nI'm gonna go ahead and ping it.\n\n1197\n00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,800\nWhen I can successfully ping it, but\nthey can't connect to it, I know they're\n\n1198\n00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,630\nconnecting by name, maybe I've got\na DNS issue or something like that.\n\n1199\n00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:24,420\nOr, if I can't ping it,\nhey, they're right.\n\n1200\n00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,640\nThere's something wrong with that\nserver and I need to go check it out.\n\n1201\n00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,030\n>> Definitely.\n\n1202\n00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:29,447\n>> What else?\nSquelches, are another one.\n\n1203\n00:53:29,447 --> 00:53:36,007\n>> Yeah, well, ensuring an even\nprocessing of your communication.\n\n1204\n00:53:36,007 --> 00:53:38,657\nWhen we're sending communications,\n\n1205\n00:53:38,657 --> 00:53:42,349\nwe wanna try to send them as\nefficiently as possible and\n\n1206\n00:53:42,349 --> 00:53:45,443\nwe don't wanna bore your network-\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1207\n00:53:45,443 --> 00:53:46,069\n>> Adapter, right?\n\n1208\n00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:48,174\nSo we wanna make sure that we've got\n\n1209\n00:53:48,174 --> 00:53:48,852\na lot-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1210\n00:53:48,852 --> 00:53:49,634\nYou're putting me to sleep there.\n\n1211\n00:53:49,634 --> 00:53:51,035\n>> Yeah.\n>> [NOISE] [LAUGH]\n\n1212\n00:53:51,035 --> 00:53:51,878\n>> We wanna make sure\n\n1213\n00:53:51,878 --> 00:53:54,524\nthat we've got some information\nthat's flowing in and\n\n1214\n00:53:54,524 --> 00:53:58,124\nout of the network adapter not boring it,\nbut at the same time we don't wanna\n\n1215\n00:53:58,124 --> 00:54:01,745\nbe sending information in talking like\nthe old micromachine man out there.\n\n1216\n00:54:01,745 --> 00:54:05,232\nAnd what's gonna happen is\nthe network adapter's gonna see,\n\n1217\n00:54:05,232 --> 00:54:07,993\nI think it's like 75% of\nthe buffer gets full,\n\n1218\n00:54:07,993 --> 00:54:11,830\nit sends a quench message back to\nthe source and says hold on a second.\n\n1219\n00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:14,740\nYou gotta stop sending information,\nbecause if you don't I'm gonna\n\n1220\n00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:19,140\nstart dropping packets, or even worse,\nand we're gonna probably talk about\n\n1221\n00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:23,190\na couple of the attacks, so security\nwise you gotta be careful with ICNP.\n\n1222\n00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:26,120\nBut the Internet Control Message Protocol,\nlot of utilities in Windows,\n\n1223\n00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,280\nI would probably know for security\npurposes some of those utilities cuz they\n\n1224\n00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:35,140\nmight not operate when we\ntry to secure from INCP.\n\n1225\n00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:39,300\nPing we've mentioned, TraceRT, determining\nthe path a packet takes from source to\n\n1226\n00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,726\ndestination, and then the combination\nof both of them is a path ping.\n\n1227\n00:54:42,726 --> 00:54:47,800\nAnd path ping uses TraceRT, but\nthen the ping part of it sends\n\n1228\n00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:53,087\n100 ICNP echo request messages\nto every router on its path.\n\n1229\n00:54:53,087 --> 00:54:57,198\nSo we need to be careful with that one and\nidentify those as ICNP, cuz when it comes\n\n1230\n00:54:57,198 --> 00:55:01,385\nto security, there might be a reason you\ndon't want to let that protocol return.\n\n1231\n00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:03,477\n>> Yeah we'll definitely\nget into some of that but\n\n1232\n00:55:03,477 --> 00:55:05,846\nping packets are just like\nany other packet, right?\n\n1233\n00:55:05,846 --> 00:55:10,360\nThey have a payload and a lot of places\nwill allow those pings to come through\n\n1234\n00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:13,443\nbecause they wanna use them for\ntroubleshooting,\n\n1235\n00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:17,312\nnot realizing that as a bad guy I\ncould load up that ping packet and\n\n1236\n00:55:17,312 --> 00:55:20,199\nuse it as a delivery method for\nmy trojan horse.\n\n1237\n00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:23,314\n>> Something like that, so\nthere is a payload in there and\n\n1238\n00:55:23,314 --> 00:55:27,311\nin fact a lot of your public web servers\nwill not respond because of some\n\n1239\n00:55:27,311 --> 00:55:30,405\nof the denial of service\nattacks we can do using ping.\n\n1240\n00:55:30,405 --> 00:55:32,915\nSo we'll get into those when we\nget into a later module for sure.\n\n1241\n00:55:32,915 --> 00:55:33,476\n>> Sounds good.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1242\n00:55:33,476 --> 00:55:36,164\nAnd then we've got IPv4,\nactually, you know what?\n\n1243\n00:55:36,164 --> 00:55:37,255\nLet's take a break real quick.\n\n1244\n00:55:37,255 --> 00:55:39,438\nI know we've been rattling on here for\nabout 25 minutes,\n\n1245\n00:55:39,438 --> 00:55:40,285\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1246\n00:55:40,285 --> 00:55:41,299\n>> So we'll take a break,\n\n1247\n00:55:41,299 --> 00:55:43,683\nlet you guys get up and\nrefill the drink of your choice and\n\n1248\n00:55:43,683 --> 00:55:45,167\nthen we'll meet you back in a few.\n\n1249\n00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:46,917\n>> [CROSSTALK] quench message back to us,\nthey're like stop.\n\n1250\n00:55:46,917 --> 00:55:48,958\n>> I heard it right, I'm quenching.\n\n1251\n00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:51,875\nWe'll let you guys refill and\nwe'll meet you back here in a couple.\n\n1252\n00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:56,693\n[NOISE] All right, welcome\n\n1253\n00:55:56,693 --> 00:56:01,955\nback ladies and gentlemen.\n\n1254\n00:56:01,955 --> 00:56:05,398\nWe left off going over, I think we just\nkind of wrapped up our list of some of\n\n1255\n00:56:05,398 --> 00:56:08,622\nthe more common protocols that we\nneed to know for this exam and talked\n\n1256\n00:56:08,622 --> 00:56:12,880\na little bit about what port numbers to go\nover, where you're gonna be using them.\n\n1257\n00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,910\nSome of the downsides or\n\n1258\n00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:17,250\nsome of the weakness of a couple of those\nprotocols and then the strengths of\n\n1259\n00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:21,320\nthe other ones that we kind of have\na choice between like http and https.\n\n1260\n00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,390\nI think we did not actually\nget to IPv4 and v6, did we?\n\n1261\n00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:25,020\n>> That's right.\n\n1262\n00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,160\n>> Let's knock those two out.\n\n1263\n00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,630\nAgain, you guys are probably noticing\nthere's a lot of refresher from\n\n1264\n00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:31,740\nnetwork plus.\n\n1265\n00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:33,520\nEspecially in this first\npart of these objectives,\n\n1266\n00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,970\nyou're gonna see a lot of things that,\nif you've studied for your network plus.\n\n1267\n00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:40,170\nIf you haven't go watch those episodes\ncuz it's part of your subscription\n\n1268\n00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:40,760\nwith ITProTV.\n\n1269\n00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,940\nYou're gonna see a lot of\nthis is covered there.\n\n1270\n00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,170\nCuz we learn about it there, and\n\n1271\n00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:48,580\nnow we're gonna just go into a little more\ndepth as we get out of this intro module.\n\n1272\n00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,932\nAnd we start breaking this\nstuff down a little further and\n\n1273\n00:56:50,932 --> 00:56:53,048\nlooking at vulnerabilities and\nthings like that.\n\n1274\n00:56:53,048 --> 00:56:54,429\nBut IPv4, IPv6.\n\n1275\n00:56:54,429 --> 00:56:56,541\nThese are IP addressing schemes.\n\n1276\n00:56:56,541 --> 00:57:00,093\n>> This is how we address\nthe nodes on the network and\n\n1277\n00:57:00,093 --> 00:57:03,220\nhow we are able to send data back and\nforth.\n\n1278\n00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,640\nJust like we were talking\nabout letters earlier.\n\n1279\n00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:09,190\nI can't mail my mom a letter if my\nmother does not have an address.\n\n1280\n00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:13,412\nI cannot send packets to another\nmachine if that machine does\n\n1281\n00:57:13,412 --> 00:57:16,151\nnot have an address to send those data.\n\n1282\n00:57:16,151 --> 00:57:21,197\n>> Yeah, and I don't know what happened\nto three, five, if there's a seven.\n\n1283\n00:57:21,197 --> 00:57:23,510\n>> Five is a failure.\n\n1284\n00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:28,470\nNo, a lot of times with the IEEE,\nthey start rolling standards back in.\n\n1285\n00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:29,910\nThey have different working groups and\n\n1286\n00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:33,630\nmaybe one of the working\ngroups doesn't work out or\n\n1287\n00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:37,960\nthey just get folded into another working\ngroup and so things like that happen.\n\n1288\n00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,690\nBut IPv4,\n\n1289\n00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:42,270\nyou don't have to know, you don't have to\nunderstand that the white paper on these.\n\n1290\n00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:43,000\n>> That's right.\n\n1291\n00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,310\n>> I mean, don't go out, if you want to\nthat's great, but you don't have to go out\n\n1292\n00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:50,430\nand read the white papers on how these\nprotocols work on this particular exam.\n\n1293\n00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:53,190\nExactly and\nwe need to understand some basics.\n\n1294\n00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:57,090\nWe need to know that ipv4 has been the\naddressing scheme for a very long time.\n\n1295\n00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:59,730\nAnd that it's a 32 bit\n\n1296\n00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:04,550\nbinary number that's divided up into\nfour octaves or eight bits each.\n\n1297\n00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:08,530\nThose octaves are going to be\nseparated with decimals or dots.\n\n1298\n00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:13,390\nAnd when we write it out, we typically\nwrite it in human-readable form,\n\n1299\n00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:16,920\nwhich is we convert it into our base\nten numbering system, or decimal.\n\n1300\n00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,240\nSo we're left with our\ndotted decimal notation.\n\n1301\n00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,040\n>> Easier for humans to read rather\nthan remembering 32 binary ones and\n\n1302\n00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,550\nzeros every time we communicate.\n\n1303\n00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:28,110\n>> I don't wanna have to write down or\ntype in 32 ones and zeros.\n\n1304\n00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:28,830\n>> Yep.\n\n1305\n00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:33,329\n>> And it requires a subnet mask\nbecause we're gonna divide that\n\n1306\n00:58:33,329 --> 00:58:38,360\naddress up into a network portion and\na node portion of that address.\n\n1307\n00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,646\n>> That's what makes it routable.\n\n1308\n00:58:39,646 --> 00:58:40,315\n>> Exactly.\n\n1309\n00:58:40,315 --> 00:58:41,390\n>> That's really what makes it routable.\n\n1310\n00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:43,890\nIf we didn't have that\nhierarchical structure, and\n\n1311\n00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:46,780\nbeing often separated with those\ndividers we just typically call\n\n1312\n00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:47,660\ndots-\n>> Right.\n\n1313\n00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:49,530\n>> It would, it would not be routable, and\n\n1314\n00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:52,390\nit would probably be\na LAN-only based technology.\n\n1315\n00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:54,536\nAnd, it does have some limitations, too.\n\n1316\n00:58:54,536 --> 00:58:57,096\nWhen you look at the overall\naddressing space,\n\n1317\n00:58:57,096 --> 00:59:00,680\nif you looked at all the possible\ncombinations that you could get,\n\n1318\n00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:05,224\nit's like 4.294 billion, a lot of times\nwe just round it up to 4.3 billion.\n\n1319\n00:59:05,224 --> 00:59:06,199\nAnd it's kind of funny,\n\n1320\n00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:09,044\nbecause that's the same limitation\nthat we have in 32 bit computing.\n\n1321\n00:59:09,044 --> 00:59:09,601\n>> Well 4.3.\n\n1322\n00:59:09,601 --> 00:59:10,491\n>> It's exactly the same concept, right.\n\n1323\n00:59:10,491 --> 00:59:11,989\n>> You get 4.3, 2 to the power of 32.\n\n1324\n00:59:11,989 --> 00:59:14,520\nWe only get 4.3 billion memory addresses.\n\n1325\n00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:18,350\nAnd that 4 gigabyte limitation that\nyou guys can check out in A Plus.\n\n1326\n00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:20,300\nBut it does have some limitations.\n\n1327\n00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,190\nIt's not very optimized.\n\n1328\n00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:26,050\nWe got a lot of broadcast\ncommunications that can, again,\n\n1329\n00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:30,470\nunnecessarily saturate our network with\njust communications that we don't have.\n\n1330\n00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:33,740\nAnd as most of the protocols\nthat we've talked about,\n\n1331\n00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:38,255\nIPv4 was developed a long time ago back\nbefore security was a major concern.\n\n1332\n00:59:38,255 --> 00:59:41,949\nAnd so security is kind of pushed or\nshoved in to IPv4, right?\n\n1333\n00:59:41,949 --> 00:59:43,463\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Dumped on top of it.\n\n1334\n00:59:43,463 --> 00:59:47,570\n>> IPv6 works with IPv4 but\nit's like it's shoehorned in there.\n\n1335\n00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:51,430\nAnd we're gonna see with our\nnext iteration of addressing\n\n1336\n00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:54,830\nthat it's built in from the ground\nup with security in mind.\n\n1337\n00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:57,260\n>> Yeah and when you look at IPv4,\n\n1338\n00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:01,897\nthere were a lot of wasted addresses\nout there when it first came out.\n\n1339\n01:00:01,897 --> 01:00:09,190\nA lot of smaller company's would have\nmultiples of these class C addresses.\n\n1340\n01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:14,040\nAnd that really just bogged down the\nrouters, the back bone of the Internet and\n\n1341\n01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:14,750\nthe communications.\n\n1342\n01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,157\nSo again not really highly optimized.\n\n1343\n01:00:16,157 --> 01:00:18,176\nAnd that is why we move\ninto the next generation.\n\n1344\n01:00:18,176 --> 01:00:21,540\n>> Yeah exactly, cuz you've heard, I mean\n>> It's even made the news, yeah?\n\n1345\n01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:23,875\nWe're running out of IPv4 addresses,\nit's the end of the world.\n\n1346\n01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:26,260\nOh, my gosh, the sky is falling.\n\n1347\n01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,990\n>> That actually happened a while ago.\n\n1348\n01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:29,720\nI think it was over two years ago.\n\n1349\n01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:32,540\nThe Internet Corporation for\nAssigned Names and Numbers,\n\n1350\n01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:36,940\none of the Asiatic Pacific Regional\nInternet Registers went to ICANN and said,\n\n1351\n01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:40,560\nhey, we need a couple of your last\nremaining blocks of IPv4 addresses that\n\n1352\n01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,460\nyou have available.\n\n1353\n01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:42,964\n>> Right.\n>> They said, okay, set up a policy and\n\n1354\n01:00:42,964 --> 01:00:45,428\nthe other regional Internet\nregisters got the remaining blocks.\n\n1355\n01:00:45,428 --> 01:00:47,398\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n1356\n01:00:47,398 --> 01:00:49,697\nThis wasn't a surprise.\n>> Iking doesn't have any left.\n\n1357\n01:00:49,697 --> 01:00:50,661\nIt doesn't mean we're gonna run out.\n\n1358\n01:00:50,661 --> 01:00:53,164\nThere's many corporations out\nthere that have them, but\n\n1359\n01:00:53,164 --> 01:00:54,503\nwe definitely have to move on.\n\n1360\n01:00:54,503 --> 01:00:56,130\n>> Yeah, it was time.\n\n1361\n01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:58,550\nThe overall number of nodes out there,\nand as you said,\n\n1362\n01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:03,100\nthe inefficient way they might have\nassigned them way early on has led to, and\n\n1363\n01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:07,160\nthat's one of the things that NAT\nkind of helped extend the lifetime.\n\n1364\n01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:10,640\nWe talked about NAT in\nour other episode today.\n\n1365\n01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,270\n>> It extended the lifetime of IPV4,\nbecause now, all of a sudden,\n\n1366\n01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:17,130\nI don't need, if I've got 500\ncomputers on my internal network,\n\n1367\n01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:20,360\nI don't need 500 public\nroutable IPV4 addresses.\n\n1368\n01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,320\nI can give one for my router.\n\n1369\n01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,310\nThey can all use private\ninternal addresses.\n\n1370\n01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:27,200\nThen I can just use NAT to\ntranslate that address and\n\n1371\n01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,770\nto give those nodes Internet access.\n\n1372\n01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:37,720\nSo you know that helped extend the\nlifetime of the IPv4 and now we have IPv6.\n\n1373\n01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:38,220\n>> Yep.\n>> Which is-\n\n1374\n01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:38,890\n>> Had it for a while now, too.\n\n1375\n01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:39,506\n>> We have.\n\n1376\n01:01:39,506 --> 01:01:40,945\nIt has been available with Windows.\n\n1377\n01:01:40,945 --> 01:01:42,356\nIt has been supported since,\n\n1378\n01:01:42,356 --> 01:01:44,549\nreally, with Vista built-in.\nXP was, I think,\n\n1379\n01:01:44,549 --> 01:01:47,246\nService Pack 3 that brought in, or\nService Pack 2 or Service Pack 3 that ex-\n\n1380\n01:01:47,246 --> 01:01:47,943\n>> Was it, yeah,\n\n1381\n01:01:47,943 --> 01:01:50,200\nthat brought in\nthe dual-stack architecture.\n\n1382\n01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:50,710\n>> Exactly.\n\n1383\n01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:53,630\nThat, again,\nkinda shoehorned in IPV 6 into there.\n\n1384\n01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:56,910\nAnd starting with Vista and\nlater, they actually prefer it.\n\n1385\n01:01:56,910 --> 01:02:01,020\nWindows 8, Server 2012,\nthey would rather do IPV 6 than IPV 4.\n\n1386\n01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:04,941\nIPV 4's still there, obviously,\nthe world is not ready to convert.\n\n1387\n01:02:04,941 --> 01:02:09,062\nWe had IPv6 Day a few months ago and\nit wasn't the most successful.\n\n1388\n01:02:09,062 --> 01:02:11,760\n>> And I think it was a DOD\ninitiative that was set too.\n\n1389\n01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,760\nThere was a DOD initiative that said that\nthe government buildings had to support\n\n1390\n01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:16,820\nit by a certain date.\n\n1391\n01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:18,020\nAnd that date's come and gone now.\n\n1392\n01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:20,030\nBut yeah.\nThere was a lot of the government\n\n1393\n01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:22,490\noffices and stuff like that,\n\n1394\n01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:25,900\ngovernment based networks had to fully\nsupport it, and it was mandated by law.\n\n1395\n01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,040\n>> And that's what we're seeing now,\n\n1396\n01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,740\nis that most of the most of the local\narea networks, our operating systems,\n\n1397\n01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:31,300\nour devices are supporting IPv6.\n\n1398\n01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:35,400\nIt's some of the public infrastructure\nthat still really needs to get upgraded,\n\n1399\n01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,990\nsome of the ISPs might be a little bit\nslow at upgrading their infrastructure.\n\n1400\n01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:43,570\nI'm sure it's a costly and\ntimely process to do that.\n\n1401\n01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:45,410\nBut, we need to know some of the basics.\n\n1402\n01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:46,080\n>> Some of the basics, yeah.\n\n1403\n01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:49,450\nWhen you look at IPv4,\nwe're talking 32 bit ad room space,\n\n1404\n01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:55,300\n32 bits of binary ones and zeros and\nwith 4.3 billion addresses very limited\n\n1405\n01:02:55,300 --> 01:03:01,470\nconsidering now even my infant son's\ndog can have a network adapter anymore.\n\n1406\n01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:06,366\nSo when we move into IPV6 we increase\nthat available IP address to something\n\n1407\n01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:09,050\nthat's just completely mind boggling.\n\n1408\n01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:12,092\nCuz it's a 128 bit addressing space and\n\n1409\n01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:16,074\nthese blocks that we have\nare no longer octets anymore.\n\n1410\n01:03:16,074 --> 01:03:19,197\nIt's actually almost,\nnot a technical term here, but\n\n1411\n01:03:19,197 --> 01:03:23,191\nlike a dual octet cuz they're 16\nbit blocks, eight 16 bit blocks.\n\n1412\n01:03:23,191 --> 01:03:24,630\nWhat's some other stuff about with IPV6?\n\n1413\n01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:25,373\n>> With IPV6?\n\n1414\n01:03:25,373 --> 01:03:27,173\nYeah they have got 128 bits.\n\n1415\n01:03:27,173 --> 01:03:28,670\n>> 128 bits.\n\n1416\n01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:31,344\n>> We really don't use\na subnet mask with IPV6.\n\n1417\n01:03:31,344 --> 01:03:32,854\nIt's the way it's divided up.\n\n1418\n01:03:32,854 --> 01:03:36,582\nAnd again I don't know that we really need\nto go into too much in this class, but\n\n1419\n01:03:36,582 --> 01:03:38,798\nyou've got what we call\nthe global prefixes.\n\n1420\n01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:41,512\nAnd these are gonna be\nassigned to the organizations,\n\n1421\n01:03:41,512 --> 01:03:43,168\nand that's the first 64 bits.\n\n1422\n01:03:43,168 --> 01:03:46,198\nAnd the then the last 64 bits are for\nthe node, and the node,\n\n1423\n01:03:46,198 --> 01:03:50,293\none of the coolest things I think about\nIPv6 is it's almost all self-generated.\n\n1424\n01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:53,042\n>> Yes.\nThe fact that my node can generate his\n\n1425\n01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:56,504\nown, well,\nwith the help of a router advertisement,\n\n1426\n01:03:56,504 --> 01:04:01,080\ncan end up generating his own\nglobally unique, routable address.\n\n1427\n01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,990\n>> Yeah, it's fascinating\nthat the connectivity device\n\n1428\n01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:04,270\ntalks to the computer or the device.\n\n1429\n01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:07,820\nThat's why it's better to say node cuz\nanything that's got self sufficient\n\n1430\n01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:09,635\ncomputing system anymore\nis considered a node.\n\n1431\n01:04:09,635 --> 01:04:10,290\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1432\n01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:11,450\n>> Even my kid's toy.\n\n1433\n01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:12,105\n>> Right, yeah.\n\n1434\n01:04:12,105 --> 01:04:14,790\n>> [LAUGH] But that they can communicate\nwith a connectivity devices and\n\n1435\n01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:17,250\nthey can configure themselves,\nstateless configuration.\n\n1436\n01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,887\nI always think of stateless and\nstay full, state of less work\n\n1437\n01:04:18,887 --> 01:04:20,234\n>> Yeah.\n\n1438\n01:04:20,234 --> 01:04:23,820\n>> State full of work, so\nyou can always remember it.\n\n1439\n01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:24,375\nI don't have to do much.\n\n1440\n01:04:24,375 --> 01:04:25,410\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Exactly.\n\n1441\n01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:27,820\n>> Yeah, and\nyou look at the possibilities, right.\n\n1442\n01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:30,580\nIn one case we're talking 4.3 billion.\n\n1443\n01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:34,418\nWhen we talk about IPv6s,\na pool of addresses, the number's just so\n\n1444\n01:04:34,418 --> 01:04:39,314\nmind boggingly large, that you just really\ncan't, we can't wrap our heads around it.\n\n1445\n01:04:39,314 --> 01:04:42,297\nCuz to start out with it's 9\nplace values above a billion.\n\n1446\n01:04:42,297 --> 01:04:43,209\n>> Right yeah, all right.\n\n1447\n01:04:43,209 --> 01:04:44,532\n>> Nine place values.\n\n1448\n01:04:44,532 --> 01:04:46,111\n>> 940 undecillion,\nif I say this right, undecillion.\n\n1449\n01:04:46,111 --> 01:04:49,240\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Undecillion, yes that's right.\n\n1450\n01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,600\n>> Go look it up on Wikipedia.\n\n1451\n01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,550\n>> Yeah.\nIt's a number that has 12 zeros,\n\n1452\n01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:55,160\nI think it's 12 zeros, behind it.\n\n1453\n01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:58,610\nIf you put a number one, comma,\nzero zero zero, comma, zero zero zero,\n\n1454\n01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:00,770\nand keep going until you have 12 zeros.\n\n1455\n01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:01,820\nThat's one undecillion.\n\n1456\n01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:05,480\nWe don't have 1,\nwe have 340 undecillion addresses.\n\n1457\n01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:08,970\n>> Yeah, I was reading a Microsoft press\nrelease book, one of the Microsoft press\n\n1458\n01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:12,820\nbooks, and one of the guys and their\nsystems engineer he made a good analogy.\n\n1459\n01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:16,110\nHe says, cuz we've talked about before,\nanalogies just don't make sense.\n\n1460\n01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:17,560\nAnd he's like, well, let me try.\n\n1461\n01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,780\nHe said if you take IPv4 and\n\n1462\n01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:23,900\nyou can convert every single individual\naddress into it's own grain of sand, you\n\n1463\n01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:28,720\ncan put that sand into a very small moving\ntruck and have plenty of room left over.\n\n1464\n01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,970\nIf you take everyone of\nthe individual IPv6s addresses and\n\n1465\n01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:36,520\nconvert them into a grain of sand, it\nwould take a container that's 1.3 billion\n\n1466\n01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,713\ntimes the circumference of our\nearth to contain the sand.\n\n1467\n01:05:39,713 --> 01:05:42,523\n>> Really, that's still just\nhard to [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n\n1468\n01:05:42,523 --> 01:05:43,812\n>> We're talking about so\n\n1469\n01:05:43,812 --> 01:05:47,290\nmind-bogglingly large it's just,\nit really is insane.\n\n1470\n01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:50,890\n>> And it has security,\nIPsec is built into IPv6.\n\n1471\n01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:54,770\nIt requires IPsec support so\nthere's security built into it.\n\n1472\n01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:56,400\n>> Cuz it was optional before.\n\n1473\n01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,490\n>> It eliminates.\n\n1474\n01:05:57,490 --> 01:06:00,640\nYeah, it was added on cuz IPv4\nwas developed way before IPsec.\n\n1475\n01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,690\nIPsec was a later development.\n\n1476\n01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:06,068\n>> So if you have IPV4 you\ncould become IPsec compliant.\n\n1477\n01:06:06,068 --> 01:06:08,610\nBut if you've got a device that\nsay's that it supports IPsec, oh,\n\n1478\n01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:11,650\nI'm sorry, IPv6, it's required,\n\n1479\n01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:14,640\nyou have to have it built in that\nyou can support IPv6 functionality.\n\n1480\n01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,760\n>> So it's got that security built\ninto it, very little broadcast at all,\n\n1481\n01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:23,120\nmost things have been converted over to\nmulticast, so much more efficient in that\n\n1482\n01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:28,290\nrespect, and you think it ends NAT\n>> Yeah, sure.\n\n1483\n01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:31,000\n>> So now we have restored\nend to end communications.\n\n1484\n01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,100\nWhen my node is talking to that web\nserver it's going to that web server.\n\n1485\n01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:38,740\nIt's not going to a device that's\nthen translating the address and\n\n1486\n01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:40,700\nthen going out and communicating for me.\n\n1487\n01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:43,470\nGetting that information back and\nthen sending it back to my node.\n\n1488\n01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:46,160\nI've got,\nwe're restoring end to end communications.\n\n1489\n01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:51,390\nEvery device out there can have a global,\nunique routable IPv6 address.\n\n1490\n01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:55,400\n>> More efficient,\nstreamline IPv6 header, so the routers\n\n1491\n01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,420\ndon't have to bog themselves down when\nthey're processing this information,\n\n1492\n01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:00,050\ndetermining which path to send it on.\n\n1493\n01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,650\nIt's interesting, I believe ARP,\n\n1494\n01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:06,740\nwe talk in other episodes about ARP being\nbroadcast communication, and ARP is now\n\n1495\n01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:12,150\nbuilt into a multicast functionality\nwithin ICMP, I believe in IPv6.\n\n1496\n01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:16,242\nSo a lot of efficiencies there and it's\ninteresting that you can look at some of\n\n1497\n01:07:16,242 --> 01:07:20,334\nthose first four blocks of an address and\nokay, say this belongs to the highest\n\n1498\n01:07:20,334 --> 01:07:23,930\npart of that internet hierarchy and\nthe next block lower hierarchy.\n\n1499\n01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:27,215\nAnd all the way back down to,\nliterally your organization itself.\n\n1500\n01:07:27,215 --> 01:07:28,010\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1501\n01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:29,500\nYeah, I liken it to zip codes.\n\n1502\n01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:34,270\nWhen you send a letter via snail mail, the\npost office doesn't look at the detailed\n\n1503\n01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:35,420\nportion of the address first, right?\n\n1504\n01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:38,460\nThey see the zip code, and they go oh,\nCalifornia, and they send it.\n\n1505\n01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:41,160\nAll right, once it gets to California,\nthey can break it down into more\n\n1506\n01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,180\ndetailed portion of the address, get it\non the right truck and get it delivered.\n\n1507\n01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:45,760\nWith the IPv6, it's very similar.\n\n1508\n01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,460\nWhen these packets hit\nthese backbone routers\n\n1509\n01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:51,530\nthey're gonna go that's Eastern Europe and\nboom send it over there.\n\n1510\n01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:55,570\nLet that ISP deal with breaking it down\ninto the smaller portions of the address,\n\n1511\n01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:57,610\nthe more detailed portions,\nand deliver it.\n\n1512\n01:07:57,610 --> 01:08:00,630\nSo, the backbone routers are not gonna\nhave to have those massive routing\n\n1513\n01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:01,290\ntables that we used to have.\n\n1514\n01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:04,050\nSo, it's gonna be a much\nmore efficient system.\n\n1515\n01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:08,980\nQoS, built into IPv6, quality of service,\nso we can differentiate\n\n1516\n01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:13,100\nbetween voice and data And\nvideo packets and things like that.\n\n1517\n01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:15,440\nSo a lot of good things with IPv6,\n\n1518\n01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,600\nmainly one of the most important things is\nthat it extends the number of addresses\n\n1519\n01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:23,115\nthat we have, but it's a newer,\nmuch more secure IP addressing system.\n\n1520\n01:08:23,115 --> 01:08:23,615\n>> Mm-hm, yep.\n\n1521\n01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:28,642\nWe do have a question there by Paul when\nhe's talking about intelligent platform\n\n1522\n01:08:28,642 --> 01:08:29,829\nmanagement interface.\n\n1523\n01:08:29,829 --> 01:08:33,423\nAnd some of the proprietary stuff, I have\nto talk with some of the other guys.\n\n1524\n01:08:33,423 --> 01:08:37,845\nBut I know that currently we're going\nthrough some more of the base standards,\n\n1525\n01:08:37,845 --> 01:08:40,684\nthe commonalities in\nthe networking protocols and\n\n1526\n01:08:40,684 --> 01:08:43,470\nsecurity techniques that\nwe're implementing.\n\n1527\n01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:46,040\n>> Yeah,\nwe won't hit anything specifically.\n\n1528\n01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:50,950\nIf you want to shoot me an email or throw\nsomething in the forums, we can definitely\n\n1529\n01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:55,590\ntake a look at that but CompTIA is\ndesigned to be platform independent.\n\n1530\n01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:57,490\nSo they don't really\ncall out any specifics,\n\n1531\n01:08:57,490 --> 01:08:58,910\nalthough we do see they hit Windows a lot.\n\n1532\n01:08:58,910 --> 01:08:59,620\n>> And they do.\n\n1533\n01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:00,500\nYeah.\n>> Maybe because it's\n\n1534\n01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,360\none of the more common operating systems\nthat you're gonna deal with out there.\n\n1535\n01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,550\nBut they try to stay away\nwith being vendor specific.\n\n1536\n01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:11,770\nThey try to stay neutral with that as far\nas the individual vendors are concerned.\n\n1537\n01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:12,870\n>> Yep.\n\n1538\n01:09:12,870 --> 01:09:15,680\n>> All right, well that's gonna bring us\nto a, we're just about, we've already\n\n1539\n01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:19,100\ncovered most of the protocols that we\nreally need worry about for this one.\n\n1540\n01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:22,809\nLets take a look at some, some,\njust some general port numbers.\n\n1541\n01:09:22,809 --> 01:09:24,231\n>> [CROSSTALK] You're welcome out there,\nPaul\n\n1542\n01:09:24,231 --> 01:09:26,225\n>> As we went through the protocols,\n\n1543\n01:09:26,225 --> 01:09:30,644\nwe gave you a couple port numbers, but\nwe'll go through a couple more here.\n\n1544\n01:09:30,644 --> 01:09:36,369\nYou don't need to know all 65,535 ports,\nright.\n\n1545\n01:09:36,369 --> 01:09:37,644\nOh, wait, 536.\n\n1546\n01:09:37,644 --> 01:09:39,596\nZero through five, 65,535.\n\n1547\n01:09:39,596 --> 01:09:40,676\n>> How's your dad's number doing?\n\n1548\n01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:44,180\n>> That's why you got\nthe cell phone [CROSSTALK]\n\n1549\n01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,898\n>> So there are a lot of ports, right?\n\n1550\n01:09:45,898 --> 01:09:49,097\nAnd I always tell people, you can think\nof a port as a, it's a connection point.\n\n1551\n01:09:49,097 --> 01:09:51,424\nAnd when your computer\nconnects to another machine,\n\n1552\n01:09:51,424 --> 01:09:53,086\nthey create what's called a socket.\n\n1553\n01:09:53,086 --> 01:09:58,000\nAnd that socket is made up of the protocol\nthat you're using, the destination IP\n\n1554\n01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,278\naddress and the port number that\nyou're receiving that protocol on.\n\n1555\n01:10:02,278 --> 01:10:05,546\nSo maybe TCP 177.2.3.4:80,\n\n1556\n01:10:05,546 --> 01:10:11,180\nto connect to a web port on a web server\nout there, or something like that.\n\n1557\n01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:12,630\nWe don't have to know all of them.\n\n1558\n01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:15,036\nWe do need to know some of the ranges.\n\n1559\n01:10:15,036 --> 01:10:17,708\nWe need to know a few of\nthe more common port numbers.\n\n1560\n01:10:17,708 --> 01:10:20,510\n>> Yeah,\ndefinitely because it really identifies\n\n1561\n01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:23,570\nwhat type of communication's\ngoing in the session, as well.\n\n1562\n01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:25,296\nIt helps to identify the traffic.\n\n1563\n01:10:25,296 --> 01:10:31,088\nFirewalls can look at these port numbers\ntoo, and say, well that's port 80.\n\n1564\n01:10:31,088 --> 01:10:34,663\nWe don't allow unsecure web traffic\nto come through, for whatever reason,\n\n1565\n01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:36,490\non this interface, and it can drop it.\n\n1566\n01:10:36,490 --> 01:10:40,000\nSo again,\nports are important to understand and\n\n1567\n01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,830\nyou also, from a security standpoint,\nhave to understand the ports and\n\n1568\n01:10:42,830 --> 01:10:45,170\nwhy you would use some,\nwhy you would close some down.\n\n1569\n01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:47,710\nAnd it's also very\nimportant with ports too,\n\n1570\n01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:50,190\nnoting that there's things\nlike port scanning attack.\n\n1571\n01:10:50,190 --> 01:10:54,133\nAnd a lot of times a port scanning\nattack isn't an attack of itself, but\n\n1572\n01:10:54,133 --> 01:10:58,618\nit can lead to things like OS profiling,\nor fingerprinting I think they call it?\n\n1573\n01:10:58,618 --> 01:11:02,272\nIf I can tell what port you're running,\nthen chances are, if it's a Windows based\n\n1574\n01:11:02,272 --> 01:11:05,194\nport only, well now I can tailor\nmake my attacks to just Windows and\n\n1575\n01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:08,187\nI can leave things like Linux and\nUnix and whatever vendor out of it.\n\n1576\n01:11:08,187 --> 01:11:08,976\nSo it is important.\n\n1577\n01:11:08,976 --> 01:11:12,210\n>> And figure out what application\nthey're running, just detect live hosts.\n\n1578\n01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:12,890\n>> Sure.\n\n1579\n01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:16,740\n>> Yes, so we break them down, the first\nthing they do is they break them down into\n\n1580\n01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:20,895\nwhat we call our registered ports right,\nour well known ports-\n\n1581\n01:11:20,895 --> 01:11:22,407\n>> Yep, and for your exam,\n\n1582\n01:11:22,407 --> 01:11:26,377\nthat's gonna be 0 to 1023,\nthose are the common services.\n\n1583\n01:11:26,377 --> 01:11:30,228\n>> Yep, those are gonna be your well known\nports, and then you've got your registered\n\n1584\n01:11:30,228 --> 01:11:33,060\nports which are gonna go\nfrom 1024 to what, 49151?\n\n1585\n01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:35,750\n>> That's it, yes sir, that's it.\n\n1586\n01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:41,672\nAnd then from 49152 all the way up\nto 65535 are just gonna be our,\n\n1587\n01:11:41,672 --> 01:11:44,030\nwhat do they even call those?\n\n1588\n01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:44,667\nDynamic ports.\n\n1589\n01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:45,750\n>> The private ports, yeah.\n\n1590\n01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:48,407\nYeah, a lot of times your operating\nsystem Will set those for\n\n1591\n01:11:48,407 --> 01:11:49,667\ntemporary communication.\n\n1592\n01:11:49,667 --> 01:11:53,811\nThat's why you can go to, for instance,\nGoogle, Google's

01:12:02,170\ninstance of that tab because it's\nusing those high number port ranges.\n\n1596\n01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:05,180\nRemember, the registered port range,\nif I'm a software manufacturer and\n\n1597\n01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:07,640\nI want to go to I know, or the IEEE, and\n\n1598\n01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:10,380\nI want my software to be\nassociated with a certain port.\n\n1599\n01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:12,880\nWell, that's why they\ncall it registered ports.\n\n1600\n01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,640\nFor instance, Microsoft has,\nand it's in the list here,\n\n1601\n01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:16,720\nif you don't mind me mentioning it.\n\n1602\n01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,270\n>> Yeah, go ahead.\n>> We've got the remote desk protocol,\n\n1603\n01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:22,410\nRDP, that is Microsoft's\nbackbone remote-control protocol.\n\n1604\n01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:26,630\nAnd if they want this to be identified\nwith Microsoft's RDP or their software,\n\n1605\n01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:29,690\nthey go to,\nI think it's the IEEE they go to.\n\n1606\n01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:34,890\nAnd they register and with this port, now\nthe world knows, if they see Port 3389,\n\n1607\n01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:38,345\nmost likely, you're gonna be running\nMicrosoft's remote desktop protocol.\n\n1608\n01:12:38,345 --> 01:12:40,365\n>> Exactly, and hopefully with the IEEE,\n\n1609\n01:12:40,365 --> 01:12:43,565\nI think once you've registered it\nother people should not use that port.\n\n1610\n01:12:43,565 --> 01:12:45,655\nRight because that's yours,\nyou've registered it.\n\n1611\n01:12:45,655 --> 01:12:47,105\n>> Yep.\n>> There's nothing really that\n\n1612\n01:12:47,105 --> 01:12:48,245\nprevents them, but-\n>> No, but\n\n1613\n01:12:48,245 --> 01:12:51,510\nit could cost software not react right.\n\n1614\n01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:54,070\n>> You're gonna have some\nfunctionality issues, exactly.\n\n1615\n01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:58,354\n>> I've modified some ports that\nthe computer was listing on to get\n\n1616\n01:12:58,354 --> 01:13:00,030\naround certain things.\n\n1617\n01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:03,310\nBut it can cause application\nconflicts that are relying on some\n\n1618\n01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:04,800\nof those registered port numbers.\n\n1619\n01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:09,910\nAnd they're expecting that when they send\ncommunication, that whatever the other end\n\n1620\n01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:13,460\nthe application's gonna be listening out\nto service, whatever those requests are.\n\n1621\n01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:15,580\n>> Right, exactly, exactly.\n\n1622\n01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:20,460\nAnd sometimes, you'll have a protocol that\nmight have a registered port that it uses.\n\n1623\n01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:23,150\nBut it wants, as you were saying,\nit wants to open up several sessions or\n\n1624\n01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:26,730\nto be able togo back to\ngood old World of Warcraft.\n\n1625\n01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:29,626\nI remember setting that thing up initially\nand then I had to get all those during\n\n1626\n01:13:29,626 --> 01:13:33,110\nthe updates after I finally went through\nand installed the six disks, or whatever.\n\n1627\n01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:35,008\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> And in the instructions it would tell\n\n1628\n01:13:35,008 --> 01:13:37,390\nyou, this is the port you have to open up.\n\n1629\n01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:40,740\nBut if you open up these additional ports,\nwe can establish a couple more\n\n1630\n01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:43,733\nconnections, and\nspeed up your turn up, right?\n\n1631\n01:13:43,733 --> 01:13:46,010\nWe get those updates down\nto you a little bit faster.\n\n1632\n01:13:46,010 --> 01:13:48,250\nSo you'll find that sometimes,\nyou've got a registered port, but\n\n1633\n01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:50,610\nthen it'll also open up\nsome dynamic ports as well.\n\n1634\n01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:52,610\nSo the dynamic ports you really\ndon't have to worry about,\n\n1635\n01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:54,290\nyou just have to know the range, right?\n\n1636\n01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:57,350\nFor your well known ports, oh gosh,\nwe could list a few of them,\n\n1637\n01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:00,740\nlike you've got, what's

careful.\n\n1820\n01:19:48,967 --> 01:19:51,417\nI remember when I was trying to remember\n\n1821\n01:19:51,417 --> 01:19:56,391\nall these ports, and all this alphabet\nsoup that we talk about, port 143 can\n\n1822\n01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:59,447\nbe easy to confuse with port 443.\nAgain,\n\n1823\n01:19:59,447 --> 01:20:04,274\nit's IMAP versus HTTPS.\nAnd then remember 389, what was 389 Mike?\n\n1824\n01:20:04,274 --> 01:20:05,241\nYou mentioned that one.\n\n1825\n01:20:05,241 --> 01:20:07,040\n>> 389 is your unsecured connection active\n\n1826\n01:20:07,040 -->

think,\n\n1837\n01:20:36,254 --> 01:20:39,015\njust a recap of these?\nCuz the last one here, and\n\n1838\n01:20:39,015 --> 01:20:43,363\nwe've kinda put this in here as\nwe've gone through everything here.\n\n1839\n01:20:43,363 --> 01:20:45,235\nNo, actually now I need to know.\n\n1840\n01:20:45,235 --> 01:20:46,062\n>> Yeah, I was gonna say.\n\n1841\n01:20:46,062 --> 01:20:46,781\n>> What was

another episode of\nIT Pro TV I'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,410\nAnd with me today is Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n5\n00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,210\nHow you doing Ronnie?\n\n6\n00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,440\n>> I am doing fine today.\n\n7\n00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:48,450\nReady to get started on another exciting\nseries on Comptia security plus.\n\n8\n00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,880\n>> Security plus that's right.\n\n9\n00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,580\nToday we are gonna be going over\nthe SY0 401 objective, and,\n\n10\n00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,860\nand specifically the, network security or\n\n11\n00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,790\nimplementing security using our networ-\n>> Devices.\n\n12\n00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:00,350\n>> Devices.\n\n13\n00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:00,990\nYeah, so good stuff.\n\n14\n00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,180\n>> Yeah, there's many different\ndevices that we do have in place, and\n\n15\n00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,750\nso we wanna make sure that you as\na security plus professional are at least\n\n16\n00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,360\nfamiliar with them.\n\n17\n00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,030\nWhere to actually implement them,\nand then also to make sure\n\n18\n00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,940\nthat we at least understand what types of,\nof configurations we might have to do.\n\n19\n00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,540\nWe're not going to get super in depth\non a lot of the configurations.\n\n20\n00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,425\nThe reason why is that believe it or not,\nMike, we actually have an entire library.\n\n21\n00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:25,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In which we configure a lot of these\n\n22\n00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,640\ndevices incredibly in depth.\n\n23\n00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,820\nSo we do want to actually make sure that\nwhen we get to the section where we talk\n\n24\n00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,400\nsome talk about some of those devices,\nif we actually have some\n\n25\n00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,070\nprevious configuration, we'll probably\nrefer to that episode as well.\n\n26\n00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:37,710\n>> Yeah.\nI mean for\n\n27\n00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,850\nthe security plus exam we really need\nto know some of the basics about these\n\n28\n00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,640\ndifferent devices.\n\n29\n00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,200\nIf you wanna dive into\nconfiguring that Cisco\n\n30\n00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,010\nrouter well we've got episodes in the\nlibrary that you have access to for that.\n\n31\n00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,530\nIn Comptia security plus we\nneed to understand you know,\n\n32\n00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,020\nwhat the different which\ndevices do I need?\n\n33\n00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,230\nWhere do I put that in my network?\n\n34\n00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,720\nI bought this cool device.\n\n35\n00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,500\nWhere do I put it?\n\n36\n00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,710\nYou know?\nWhere do I plug this thing in?\n\n37\n00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,530\nWhere does it sit in\nthe layout of my network?\n\n38\n00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,460\nAnd then, how do I do some basic\nconfiguration to it to get it out of that\n\n39\n00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,320\ndefault configuration?\n\n40\n00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,450\nOnce we get that,\nthat's what security plus focuses on and\n\n41\n00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,760\nthen after that we can go into\nmore depth if we need to.\n\n42\n00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,000\n>> Yeah, that makes a great point,\nespecially in the security sense,\n\n43\n00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,460\nthat a lot of the devices\nthat we end up purchasing.\n\n44\n00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,090\nRight?\nThey do have those default settings on\n\n45\n00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,820\nthem, and one of the key things about\nimplementing security, of course,\n\n46\n00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,660\nthen is to control the access to that\ndevice, or begin the hardening process.\n\n47\n00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,950\nIt's a great way for us to at least\nlearn some of the basic configurations\n\n48\n00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,905\nthat we need to get set up Set up\nto make sure that we can use them.\n\n49\n00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:31,655\n>> Exactly.\n\n50\n00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:32,635\nAlright, so let's see Ronnie.\n\n51\n00:02:32,635 --> 00:02:34,085\nLet's start off with something.\n\n52\n00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:35,045\nMaybe firewalls.\n\n53\n00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:36,895\n>> Sure.\n>> We'll just kind of run down the list\n\n54\n00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:39,085\nof different types of equipment.\n\n55\n00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:40,375\nAnd we'll go through each one.\n\n56\n00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,785\nSo, firewalls first?\n\n57\n00:02:41,785 --> 00:02:43,415\n>> Sure.\nWhen we take a look at different\n\n58\n00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:45,565\ntypes of firewalls inside of our network,\n\n59\n00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:49,700\nwe've got to have an understanding of\nwhat in the world a firewall actually is.\n\n60\n00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,100\nAnd why would we use a term like that?\n\n61\n00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,950\nWell inside of a lot of cars, right?\n\n62\n00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,430\nBetween the engine compartment and\n\n63\n00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,070\nthe cabin that you tend to sit in\nthat nice air conditioned cabin.\n\n64\n00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,050\nHere in Florida that's a luxury\nhaving it here in Florida\n\n65\n00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,320\nyes you understand the humidity and\nthe heat combine make it like molten lava.\n\n66\n00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,340\nThe air actually feels like that a lot\nof times when you start doing that.\n\n67\n00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,600\n>> Yeah it does.\nBut,\n\n68\n00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,090\nremember that the engine compartment's\nactually even hotter, so,\n\n69\n00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,900\nyes you have a nice gigantic block of\nmetal in there that's usually churning\n\n70\n00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,270\nwhen Mike's driving about 9,000 rpm's,\nand it's generating a ton of heat, but\n\n71\n00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,660\nthere's a wall in-between\nthat is called a firewall.\n\n72\n00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,930\nSo, that if something\ndoes happen in there,\n\n73\n00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,580\nusually the passengers on\nthe inside are also protected too.\n\n74\n00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,600\nAnd we see the same concept inside of\nbuildings as well, that we do have some\n\n75\n00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,430\nwalls that actually are designed to\nresist fire for a certain amount of time.\n\n76\n00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,320\nWell, the whole idea behind\nthis firewall is to actually be\n\n77\n00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,330\nable to implement a security\nlayer in between.\n\n78\n00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,160\nOf course, what we call a trusted side and\n\n79\n00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,060\nan untrusted side is what we want\nto at least have the basics of.\n\n80\n00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,960\nSo anything on one side of the wall,\nwe wanna say,\n\n81\n00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,160\nhey, I wanna be able to implement\na security of, of that difference, right?\n\n82\n00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,240\nHere's a side that I actually\nwanna keep protected.\n\n83\n00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,800\nHere's a side that I'm protecting it from.\n\n84\n00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:06,640\nSo in that particular idea, then, we\nhave three different types of firewalls.\n\n85\n00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,750\nThat we can really talk about, and\nthis has actually evolved over the years.\n\n86\n00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,170\nAt one time we probably just had one,\n\n87\n00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,030\nbut then we started realizing\nthat that one wasn't enough.\n\n88\n00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,890\nIt didn't actually do enough here.\n\n89\n00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,280\nSo let's just start off by,\nby just naming these three, okay?\n\n90\n00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,810\nSo the basic one at the very beginning,\nespecially when networks came along.\n\n91\n00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,945\nIs probably what we call just\nthe network based firewall.\n\n92\n00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:28,740\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n93\n00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,400\n>> As well, and this is usually\na device that we have, and so\n\n94\n00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,870\nif you've heard about a Cisco ASA,\nor if you've heard\n\n95\n00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,710\nCisco Pix Firewall, an older one\n>> This is actually\n\n96\n00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,060\na device that's out there now.\n\n97\n00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,440\nBelieve it or not, my gosh,\nyou have a pix at home, I have an ASA.\n\n98\n00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,780\nI actually have an older one called a net\nscreen firewall from way back in the day,\n\n99\n00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,700\nand I have all three of those things and\n\n100\n00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,560\nover those years I've just\nreplaced them one after the other.\n\n101\n00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,870\nAnd what that actually does\nis provide that very basic\n\n102\n00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,290\nsecurity that I need at\nthe edge of my network.\n\n103\n00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,910\nIt really does say hey,\nhere's the outside, and here's the inside.\n\n104\n00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,520\nMy next screen's actually the most\nintuitive of them all, my and\n\n105\n00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,610\nthe reason why is there's\nonly two ports on it.\n\n106\n00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,280\nOne says untrusted and\nthe other side says trusted.\n\n107\n00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,510\nSo, I know that, hey, the untrusted side,\n\n108\n00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,260\nI'm not supposed to plug that\ninto the network that I trust.\n\n109\n00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,540\nI'm supposed to plug that into\nthe network I don't trust.\n\n110\n00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,290\nAnd that's usually the connection facing\nthe internet is the one I normally have.\n\n111\n00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:22,940\n>> Wow.\nI like that one.\n\n112\n00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,510\nThat sounds like one I could set up.\n\n113\n00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,920\nTrusted, untrusted.\n\n114\n00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,660\nThere we go.\n\n115\n00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,690\n>> That is by far the easiest\nthing in the world.\n\n116\n00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,363\nBut there are times though, when we start\nusing these firewalls that we started to\n\n117\n00:05:33,363 --> 00:05:36,931\nfind out more and more especially in the\nbusiness world that a lot of the security\n\n118\n00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:39,450\nbreaches didn't happen just\nthrough that interface.\n\n119\n00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:39,980\nRight, Mike?\n\n120\n00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,840\n>> Yeah, I mean, if we, if we think about\nthis, what we're talking about, putting\n\n121\n00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,020\nthis rou-, this firewall in-between us and\nthe outside world, maybe.\n\n122\n00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,800\nOr as Ronnie said, between the un-trusted\nportion and the trusted portion but\n\n123\n00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,320\nif that's my only layer of defense,\n\n124\n00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,990\nremember we always talk about in\nsecurity plus layers of defense.\n\n125\n00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,610\nAnd if I put that firewall there, sure,\n\n126\n00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,350\nthat's gonna help me keep that unwanted\ntraffic from coming into my network.\n\n127\n00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,890\nBut what if something slips by?\n\n128\n00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,710\nWhat if it makes it through that layer?\n\n129\n00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,230\nIf that's my only layer, now I'm done.\n\n130\n00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,590\nThey've got free reign inside my network\nand that used to be the strategy, right?\n\n131\n00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,760\n>> Right.\n>> Was put firewalls at the border\n\n132\n00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,610\nof your network anywhere that your\nnetwork touched the outside world, for\n\n133\n00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,510\nexample, and we were done.\n\n134\n00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,380\nBut then we found that over time,\nyou know, that hey,\n\n135\n00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:26,130\nif they breech that I've got nothing left\nto stop them and they've got free reign\n\n136\n00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,650\nof whatevers inside, or\non the other side of that firewall.\n\n137\n00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,292\n>> Yeah, you and I both work,\nwork with a lot of jokers.\n\n138\n00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:33,700\n>> Hm-mm. [LAUGH] >> And\ndifferent people that actually end up\n\n139\n00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,930\n>> Kind of making fun of us.\n\n140\n00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,092\nOr, at least make fun of me.\n\n141\n00:06:36,092 --> 00:06:37,370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's put it that way.\n\n142\n00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,610\nBut, overall though,\nthe problem that we also have,\n\n143\n00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,680\nespecially when we work in a large\nenvironment, is that you and\n\n144\n00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,580\nI never know what people\nbring with them to work.\n\n145\n00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,930\nSo, they just have to say, hey, look,\n\n146\n00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:51,150\nI downloaded an application at home And\nthen they come to work and say,\n\n147\n00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,725\noh, I wanna see if that application\nwill run on my work computer.\n\n148\n00:06:53,725 --> 00:06:56,280\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now they have it on that USB key and\n\n149\n00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,830\nthey plug it into the computer.\n\n150\n00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,670\nWell, that firewall that I spent\nhours,maybe configuring perfectly,\n\n151\n00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,300\nmaking sure it actually worked.\n\n152\n00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,270\nIt was just bypassed simply by\n>> Yeah.\n\n153\n00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,760\n>> Somebody bringing in a USB\nkey right to the device itself.\n\n154\n00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,670\nNow Mike, there's a different type of\nfirewall that we can use that may help us\n\n155\n00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,360\nto prevent that too.\n\n156\n00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,270\nRight?\n>> Absolutely.\n\n157\n00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,160\nWe can have that firewall sitting\nat the edge of our network, but\n\n158\n00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,290\nthen just in case Ron as Ronnie mentions,\n\n159\n00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,870\nsomebody breaches security by bringing\nsomething in manually or somebody\n\n160\n00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,110\ncompromises that firewall, we can also\nput firewalls on the individual hosts.\n\n161\n00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,970\nThese will be called host based firewalls.\n\n162\n00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:33,070\nAnd they can protect, and just like the\nname implies, they're only gonna protect\n\n163\n00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:37,630\nthat one host whereas a network firewall\nis protecting the entire network.\n\n164\n00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,550\nHost based protecting that host, so\n\n165\n00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,770\nI would need to run a host based firewall\non each node that I want to protect.\n\n166\n00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,501\n>> That is by far one of the best\nthings we can do when we start\n\n167\n00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:49,993\nactually using firewalls is to\nunderstand that even though we have that\n\n168\n00:07:49,993 --> 00:07:52,509\nnetwork based firewall at\nthe edge of our network.\n\n169\n00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:56,288\nInside, every node also needs\nprotected because it can be bypassed.\n\n170\n00:07:56,288 --> 00:08:00,033\nSomebody may be smart enough to figure\nout their way through that firewall But\n\n171\n00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:03,777\nby implementing what we call these\nhost-based firewalls, in other words,\n\n172\n00:08:03,777 --> 00:08:07,430\nones that are running on individual\nmachines, we can do that too.\n\n173\n00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,740\nNow normally when we start thinking\nabout something like that,\n\n174\n00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,930\nthe examples that I can\ngive you are actually the,\n\n175\n00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,895\nthe ones that're running on\nour laptops right now, Mike.\n\n176\n00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:16,060\n>> Mm-hm.\nThe Windows firewall is by far\n\n177\n00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,630\none of the best examples.\n\n178\n00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,630\nAnd if you're actually inside of Linux,\nthey call them, I think IP tables,\n\n179\n00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,380\nis what they call them.\n\n180\n00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:21,880\n>> Mm-hm., exactly.\n\n181\n00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,660\n>> So, there's a lot of different\nones that you can set up.\n\n182\n00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,290\nNow, the nice thing is with\nthe Window's firewall,\n\n183\n00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,615\nit's actually become more advanced.\n\n184\n00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:30,960\nAt one time, it was like, okay,\neither you want it on or you don't.\n\n185\n00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,228\nBut today with that advanced set settings,\nI can't remember what it's called,\n\n186\n00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:36,420\nthe advanced settings.\n\n187\n00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,980\nYou can be incredibly granular\nin actually saying hey,\n\n188\n00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,810\nwhat I want to come through and\nwhat I don't want to come through.\n\n189\n00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,855\nAnd even better than that,\nespecially with those host-based ones,\n\n190\n00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:46,880\nwe can even actually\nhave outbound rules too.\n\n191\n00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,800\nSay hey, I don't want this type of\ntraffic to leave this device as well.\n\n192\n00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,660\nSo it's amazing about how granular we can\nget, even with these host-based firewalls.\n\n193\n00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,260\n>> Absolutely.\n\n194\n00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,290\nSo by running these host-based firewalls\non the individual host within my network,\n\n195\n00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,310\nit prevents things like Ronnie\nwas talking about earlier.\n\n196\n00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,860\nIf somebody brings something into\nmy network via USB, or email, or\n\n197\n00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,390\nsomething like that, that it's not gonna\nbe able to hit other hosts on my network,\n\n198\n00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,480\nbecause each host has a,\na firewall running on it.\n\n199\n00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,860\nOr if a bad guy gets through\nmy outer firewall and\n\n200\n00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,830\ncompromises one of my interior machines,\nhe's not gonna have free rein going all\n\n201\n00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,830\nthe other different hosts on the network\nbecause they each run that firewall.\n\n202\n00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,277\nSo we've got network-based firewalls\nthat are protecting the entire network.\n\n203\n00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:32,820\nWe've got host-based firewalls that are\ngonna protect each individual host, but\n\n204\n00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,000\nthen we have another type of\nfirewall that we can run as well,\n\n205\n00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,170\na relatively newcomer to the game, right?\n\n206\n00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:37,890\n>> It really is.\n\n207\n00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,650\nIt's what we call a web application\nfirewall, and this is really designed to\n\n208\n00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,860\nhelp protect the web services that\nyou tend to actually have to run for\n\n209\n00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,620\nyour customers to connect to.\n\n210\n00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,940\nSo the, the biggest type of websites\nthat we tend to have on the,\n\n211\n00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,030\nthe planet right now are blogs, right?\n\n212\n00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,940\nAnd the majority of them, I think like 80\nor 90% of them are the what is it called?\n\n213\n00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,740\nWord, WordPress.\n\n214\n00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,473\n>> WordPress. Yes. [LAUGH]\n>> I was about to say WordStar but\n\n215\n00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:04,310\nthat's actually a an,\nan older word processor program.\n\n216\n00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,275\nBut it's WordPress.\n\n217\n00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:08,580\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> WordPress websites are just everywhere.\n\n218\n00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,760\nAnd we have to understand something.\n\n219\n00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,200\nThe more that they're out there,\n\n220\n00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,600\nthe more that somebody's saying\nyou wanna know something?\n\n221\n00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,640\nI bet you that I can\ncompromise that site and\n\n222\n00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,250\nI can do some different things with it.\n\n223\n00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,100\nAnd if I'm hosting it on my own,\neven though I might have that host space\n\n224\n00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,210\nfirewall that can protect me from a lot\nand I might have that network space.\n\n225\n00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,100\nBut I might actually need something\nthat's more specific that's actually\n\n226\n00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,740\ntuned to what we call that application,\nand\n\n227\n00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,240\nthat's what these web application\nfirewalls are designed to do.\n\n228\n00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,490\nThey're really designed to help\nus to make sure that that website\n\n229\n00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:44,335\nis able to burn up that kind of attacking\ntracker, those denial of service stuff.\n\n230\n00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:44,960\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n231\n00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,760\n>> And, and everything else that\ncould compromise that site.\n\n232\n00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,168\nAnd you might be wondering why,\nwhy do they actually just pick that one?\n\n233\n00:10:51,168 --> 00:10:52,940\nBecause that's a site that e-commerce.\n\n234\n00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,232\nThat's the stuff that we really wanna\nprotect against cuz if that stuff goes\n\n235\n00:10:56,232 --> 00:10:58,900\ndown, that's when we start\nactually losing money.\n\n236\n00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,730\nAnd so\na lot of people spend a lot of time and\n\n237\n00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:04,840\na lot of money making sure that their\nsite actually remains untouched and,\n\n238\n00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,900\nyou know, by, buy these things, and\nthey can pay a ton of money for these.\n\n239\n00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,725\nSo on this last one, because this is by\nfar the most foreign one that we have.\n\n240\n00:11:12,725 --> 00:11:13,960\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Cuz you can look on your\n\n241\n00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,445\nown machine if you're running Windows.\n\n242\n00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:17,025\n>> Right.\n\n243\n00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:17,875\n>> To be able to do that.\n\n244\n00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,715\n>> Yeah, if, if you've got, you know, your\nhost-based firewalls, we, we talked about,\n\n245\n00:11:20,715 --> 00:11:22,555\nyou know, the Windows firewall\nwith advanced security,\n\n246\n00:11:22,555 --> 00:11:25,385\nwe've got the, on Linux,\nwe've got our IF tables.\n\n247\n00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:25,905\nOur-\n>> IP tables.\n\n248\n00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:28,465\n>> Our IP tables sorry, our IP tables.\n\n249\n00:11:28,465 --> 00:11:31,665\nThe web application firewalls are as\nyou said, you know, they're specific\n\n250\n00:11:31,665 --> 00:11:35,835\nto that particular application, and\nit's just another layer of security.\n\n251\n00:11:35,835 --> 00:11:37,615\nWe're gonna repeat that over and over-\n>> Right.\n\n252\n00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:40,450\n>> And\nover throughout the security plus track or\n\n253\n00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,570\nepisodes, layers of security,\nlayers of defense.\n\n254\n00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,600\nI don't wanna rely on just one thing.\n\n255\n00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,820\nAnd so this is just another step.\n\n256\n00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,200\nAnd you run this, as you said,\nprobably on my my servers.\n\n257\n00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,280\nMaybe they sit at my DMZ that\nhave that application that\n\n258\n00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,700\nthe public needs access to.\n\n259\n00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,440\nSo, I've gotta let that traffic\nthrough that outer firewall.\n\n260\n00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,300\nI've gotta let it into the host, so\nI've gotta make those exceptions there.\n\n261\n00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,350\nAnd then once it's up at that application\nlayer, we can get a little more specific\n\n262\n00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,930\nabout what we're allowing\nwhat we're not allowing,\n\n263\n00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,630\nmaybe even doing some looking inside\npackets and things like that.\n\n264\n00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,140\n>> Definitely.\nAnd\n\n265\n00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,890\nwhen we start talking about\nlooking inside of packets,\n\n266\n00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:17,340\nthis is something that actually is kind of\nneat too, the web application firewall and\n\n267\n00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,420\nthe very fact that it can actually\ntake a look at a traffic and go hey,\n\n268\n00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,255\nthis is actually sequel traffic\nthat's coming in and not web traffic.\n\n269\n00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:26,880\nIt can actually distinguish that\nby being aware of what's actually\n\n270\n00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,120\ntrying to come in.\n\n271\n00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,630\nSo there's some examples out there,\nand I went ahead on my laptop and\n\n272\n00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,530\npulled up a couple of the different\nwebsites that you can go to and\n\n273\n00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,640\nalso learn a little bit more about\nthe web application firewalls.\n\n274\n00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,930\nSo IronBee's actually one\nby Qualys that's out there.\n\n275\n00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,540\nAnd they actually are having what,\nthis is what they call an open sourced web\n\n276\n00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,436\napplication firewall engine,\nthat they are also developing too.\n\n277\n00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:52,520\nAnd usually when you start talking about\nopen source, in the future this is\n\n278\n00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,610\nactually gonna probably be the model\nthat you're gonna see more often.\n\n279\n00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,550\nSo here's one that you also see, and then,\nof course, there are different companies,\n\n280\n00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,330\nsuch as this one.\n\n281\n00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:04,980\nThis is from Trustwave and I, no,\nthis is not the Trustwave one.\n\n282\n00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,130\nThe mod security is.\n\n283\n00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,060\nSo this is from a company called Port80,\nand they actually go ahead and\n\n284\n00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,100\nthey also have their own enterprise\nweb application firewall.\n\n285\n00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,850\nAnd this is designed specifically\nMike for, for your favorite\n\n286\n00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:21,360\nhearing [LAUGH] the IIS, yeah, the,\nthe actual Microsoft web server itself.\n\n287\n00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,680\nSo, so this is what, you're like, oh,\nyeah, this is for, for that one too.\n\n288\n00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,780\nAnd here's another one, and\n\n289\n00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,805\nthis one is from Trustwave SpiderLabs,\nanother open source one too.\n\n290\n00:13:30,805 --> 00:13:34,567\nAnd it, it really does operate like the\nfirewalls in the way that we need them,\n\n291\n00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:37,987\nbut really tuned specifically for\nyou know, your application and\n\n292\n00:13:37,987 --> 00:13:40,775\neverything else that you\nneed to protect that.\n\n293\n00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:43,665\nNow just when we think that's,\nthat's all that there is,\n\n294\n00:13:43,665 --> 00:13:48,100\na lot of times all this stuff does require\nincredible amount of management to, to,\n\n295\n00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,690\nto make these things tuned particularly\nright in the way that we want them to.\n\n296\n00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:54,910\nAnd so today we're actually\nstarting to see a move towards\n\n297\n00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,610\neven hosted firewall solutions\nthat are actually out there.\n\n298\n00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,820\nIn other words,\ncompanies actually said, hey,\n\n299\n00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,450\nlet us manage protecting your website,\nprotecting your end of things.\n\n300\n00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,590\nAnd, and you just worry about building\nit and, and you, you do that.\n\n301\n00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,390\nSo you can offload that to,\nto other places.\n\n302\n00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:15,910\nSo like security.com, I think,\nis probably one that you actually hear of.\n\n303\n00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,245\nAnd there's actually prob,\nprobably plenty of them out there.\n\n304\n00:14:18,245 --> 00:14:18,750\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n305\n00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,530\n>> But all three of these\nare actually viable depending on\n\n306\n00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,020\nwhat your need is for the network.\n\n307\n00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:27,400\nSo in the home network, really most of us\nprobably aren't, aren't gonna go out and\n\n308\n00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,865\nbuy a Cisco ASA.\n\n309\n00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:29,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can.\n\n310\n00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,033\n>> Only Ronnie.\n>> Don't get me wrong.\n\n311\n00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:31,550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n312\n00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,310\nYeah, yeah, you can but\nmost of us probably are not.\n\n313\n00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:37,070\nBut we do have people here,\nlike Nate that you know,\n\n314\n00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,331\nhe, he actually has built\nhis own pfSense firewall.\n\n315\n00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:43,510\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Which is a, a network-based firewall.\n\n316\n00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:47,500\nAnd that's actually another one that\nyou can also if you really want to,\n\n317\n00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,370\nto get into, in the ability to\nlearn more about your firewalls,\n\n318\n00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,320\nthe nice thing about pfSense, it's free.\n\n319\n00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,010\n>> It's free.\n\n320\n00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:54,520\n>> Free.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n321\n00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,020\n>> Yeah.\n\n322\n00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,150\nIf you want to you can take\n\n323\n00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,740\nan old computer, or an older computer.\n\n324\n00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,590\nYou don't have to do an old one.\n\n325\n00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,940\nIf you want to spend tons of money for\nit, you can.\n\n326\n00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,890\nGuarantee you.\n\n327\n00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,800\nBut if you actually want to be able to do\nthat, you really need about two NICs and\n\n328\n00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,900\nyou're probably ready\nto go on the computer.\n\n329\n00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,790\nAnd all I have to do is click on\nthis Download Now button and then,\n\n330\n00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,856\nyou can actually go ahead and download\nthis and install it onto that box.\n\n331\n00:15:15,856 --> 00:15:18,620\nIt installs like the regular\noperating system does, boots up and\n\n332\n00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,320\nthen you're ready to, to begin some of\nthat configuration through a web interface\n\n333\n00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,240\nand you're off and going.\n\n334\n00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,740\nNow, when I said that you're like oh,\ncool.\n\n335\n00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,920\nThere's not a lot to it.\n\n336\n00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,160\nWhen you open up pfSense [LAUGH] you're\ngonna see more little tiny buttons and\n\n337\n00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,640\nyou're gonna have to explore\na lot to make it work.\n\n338\n00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,560\n>> Yeah.\n>> But it is a good effort of\n\n339\n00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,920\na good effort,\nespecially if you're looking at security,\n\n340\n00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,120\nto at least understand\nthe basics here in doing that.\n\n341\n00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,980\n>> Yeah.\n>> So\n\n342\n00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,640\nall three of those are actually very good,\n\n343\n00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,850\nand, and, and\nwe do tend to need to implement them.\n\n344\n00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,160\nSo remember that the network based ones,\nusually at the edge.\n\n345\n00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,621\nThe host based ones, on every individual\ncomputer and even server on a network.\n\n346\n00:15:52,621 --> 00:15:54,795\nAnd then,\nif you're running a web application,\n\n347\n00:15:54,795 --> 00:15:57,089\nusually that's also gonna\nbe on the web server too.\n\n348\n00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:58,770\n>> Exactly,\nwhatever's running on that application so.\n\n349\n00:15:58,770 --> 00:15:59,443\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n350\n00:15:59,443 --> 00:16:03,312\nAnd if you guys want more information\nabout that pfSense check our calendars\n\n351\n00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:04,800\nwe've got a whole entire-\n>> Oh, right.\n\n352\n00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,630\n>> Series coming up, talking about\nconfiguring a pfSense firewall.\n\n353\n00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,400\nSo tune in for that one,\nthat's gonna be a great show.\n\n354\n00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,450\nWe did talk about the three main types,\nor categories, of firewalls.\n\n355\n00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,330\nWe got the network-based firewall.\n\n356\n00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,810\nWe got the host based,\nwe got the web app based,\n\n357\n00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:21,520\nyou know I think one of the keys I\nalso want to make sure we point out.\n\n358\n00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,520\nThe web app firewall, pretty,\npretty self-explanatory,\n\n359\n00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,780\nit's going to go on the server\nthat's hosting that application,\n\n360\n00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,320\nthe network bay or\nthe host based is on each individual host.\n\n361\n00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,320\nThe network base, though, you know, we say\nat the edge of the network, and I want to\n\n362\n00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,150\nmake sure we understand that it's really\nimportant that we make sure that all that\n\n363\n00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,340\ntraffic that's coming into that network\nis flowing through that firewall, right?\n\n364\n00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,950\nI don't want there to\nbe more that one route,\n\n365\n00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,780\nbecause then they could try to go around\nthat firewall, so when you implement this,\n\n366\n00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,820\nand I think you might have\na drawing you can show?\n\n367\n00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,070\n>> We do, and I have a little, simple\ndiagram that really can help us out here.\n\n368\n00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:57,160\nSo normally we might have even a router,\nthat we do connect to other networks,\n\n369\n00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,850\nsuch as the Internet,\n\n370\n00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,500\nand maybe even to my branch office, but\nI can also have my firewall here too.\n\n371\n00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,390\nAnd notice that it doesn't matter,\nregardless, even though this is\n\n372\n00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:10,658\na trusted network for me because it's\nactually part of my, entire company.\n\n373\n00:17:10,658 --> 00:17:15,580\nThis branch office, though, is not going\nto bypass this firewall over here and\n\n374\n00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,920\nI'm not gonna bypass his firewall.\n\n375\n00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,810\nSo we really wanna make sure that all\nof our traffic, in between our trusted\n\n376\n00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:26,140\nnetworks and our untrusted networks is\nalways flowing through that firewall.\n\n377\n00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,520\nAnytime somebody else comes up and\nsays, well,\n\n378\n00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,475\nwhat if I just add another cable\nin here around the firewall?\n\n379\n00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:34,070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, now you've bypassed the entire\n\n380\n00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,020\nsecurity of the firewall itself.\n\n381\n00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,200\nSo it doesn't mean that you can't have it.\n\n382\n00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,120\nI just means that, well, now you've\nactually given them a different way\n\n383\n00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,480\naround it, and that's what we want to\nprevent when we have something like this.\n\n384\n00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,260\nSo understanding where they're actually\nlocated is going to be the key here too.\n\n385\n00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,800\nNow one other thing especially when you\nstart taking a look some of the basic\n\n386\n00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,570\nconfiguration of these firewalls,\nwe could talk a little bit about\n\n387\n00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,550\nthe firewall rules and\nwhat has to happen as well.\n\n388\n00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:03,390\nSo, when you actually start implementing\nthese, one of the things that the way that\n\n389\n00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:06,250\nit tends to do it,\nis based off of different rules.\n\n390\n00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,070\nSo, you actually configure what\nyou want to allow in through that\n\n391\n00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,590\nuntrusted interface.\n\n392\n00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,630\nAnd, what you want to\nallow out through that,\n\n393\n00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,510\ntrusted interface to\nthe untrusted side as well.\n\n394\n00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,410\nWhen you configure those rules,\n\n395\n00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:24,710\nyou always want to understand that you\nstart with the most specific rules first.\n\n396\n00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,330\nAnd, and then you work towards the most\ngeneral rules in, in this list.\n\n397\n00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,870\nAnd that's because a firewall when\nit takes a look at a list of rules\n\n398\n00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,160\nit works it from top to the bottom.\n\n399\n00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,180\nAnd so when that ends up happening though,\n\n400\n00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,020\nwhat you can do is accidentally do\nsomething you didn't mean to do.\n\n401\n00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,340\nAnd so.\n\n402\n00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,150\n>> Been there done that.\n\n403\n00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,010\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH] Right, yeah.\n\n404\n00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:48,240\n>> Let's see if we can, I'm gonna see\nif I can pull up Notepad here just for\n\n405\n00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,130\na moment.\n\n406\n00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:54,080\nAnd just kind of,\ngive an example here if I can.\n\n407\n00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:00,200\nSo, when we talk about the idea\nof the order of rules, right?\n\n408\n00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,755\nSo we want to make sure that we\nactually have the most specific,\n\n409\n00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:05,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n410\n00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:12,680\n>> If I can spell it, specific,\n[LAUGH] rules at the top, and toward,\n\n411\n00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:19,850\nmore general rules at the bottom.\n\n412\n00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,860\nNow, you may wonder,\nlike why is that actually important?\n\n413\n00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,810\nWell, let me go ahead and show you.\n\n414\n00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:28,890\nSo, if I put the more general rule\nat the top, so what I want to do is,\n\n415\n00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,240\nI might want to actually allow something,\njust talk about the logic here.\n\n416\n00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,320\nAllow any source, okay?\n\n417\n00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,620\nSo that's gonna be my trusted side.\n\n418\n00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,230\nSo let me just say trusted.\n\n419\n00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:44,054\nAllow trusted to untrusted and normally we\n\n420\n00:19:44,054 --> 00:19:48,880\nmight actually indicate then a protocol.\n\n421\n00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,680\nSo, If I say something like any traffic or\nIP traffic, okay?\n\n422\n00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,310\nAnd I actually want to allow outbound,\nperfectly well.\n\n423\n00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,486\nI can't spell outbound.\n\n424\n00:19:59,486 --> 00:20:00,450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, but\n\n425\n00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,960\nthen if I come back later on and say,\n\n426\n00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,160\nyou know something,\nI really didn't want to allow web traffic.\n\n427\n00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:14,570\nSo then I put deny trusted,\noops, to untrusted.\n\n428\n00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:21,460\nAnd I actually just do the web which\nis gonna be port 80 or www Outbound.\n\n429\n00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:21,960\nAll right.\n\n430\n00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,000\nSo, the second rule is actually more\nspecific than the first, right?\n\n431\n00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,100\nWell, in the way that this ends up\nprocessing if now traffic is trying\n\n432\n00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,720\nto go to a web server,\nit's going to hit this first rule first.\n\n433\n00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,380\nRight?\nMakes sense, first rule, comes first here.\n\n434\n00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,770\nAnd it actually says, alright,\n\n435\n00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:46,560\nyou're saying trusted to untrusted\nanything is actually able to go out.\n\n436\n00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,400\nAnd then secondly, I'm saying deny,\njust the web traffic.\n\n437\n00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,410\nWell, it's gonna say,\nyou already allowed it to go through,\n\n438\n00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,150\nhow am I going to deny it?\n\n439\n00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,970\n>> So, in other words, the, the first rule\nthat the matches is the one that it's\n\n440\n00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:01,933\ngonna implement and\nit's not even gonna try the other rules.\n\n441\n00:21:01,933 --> 00:21:03,628\n>> Right.\n>> It doesn't go through each one,\n\n442\n00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:07,380\nsoon as it finds one that matches, that's\nthe one that it's going to apply to that\n\n443\n00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,630\nparticular packet so you've gotta watch\nthe order that you put these rules in.\n\n444\n00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,320\n>> Right.\n\n445\n00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,590\nSo, if we just change this around,\n\n446\n00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,180\nwe'll see why that actually\nmakes much more effect here.\n\n447\n00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,900\nRight?\n\n448\n00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,870\nIf I now have this web\ntraffic going outbound,\n\n449\n00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,920\nperfectly fine, it's going to get denied.\n\n450\n00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,601\nBut what about all the other\ntraffic like email?\n\n451\n00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:26,220\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n452\n00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,180\n>> And\njust other things that I'm actually doing?\n\n453\n00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,670\nWell it doesn't match the first rule so\nit's not gonna actually match there, and\n\n454\n00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,740\nthen it will head to the second rule.\n\n455\n00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,170\nSo if it doesn't match,\nit continues to move on down the list and\n\n456\n00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,830\nthen it's here that all the other\ntraffic can actually get outbound, too.\n\n457\n00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,330\nNow, there is one other rule\nthat I want to mention normally.\n\n458\n00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,540\nThe way that firewalls end up\nworking right at the beginning\n\n459\n00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,360\nis that they really do set up,\nyou can say, like, a brick wall.\n\n460\n00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,120\nAnd what you're doing when you're\nconfiguring these rules is you're punching\n\n461\n00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,130\nholes through that wall to say what\nyou want to allow in or out, so\n\n462\n00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:05,290\nat the very end there normally is\nwhat they call an implicit deny any.\n\n463\n00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:09,370\nIn other words, it's actually down,\nthe very last rule on anything.\n\n464\n00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,980\nInside of the firewall and even on,\non local access control lists.\n\n465\n00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,300\nIt's actually deny anything to anywhere.\n\n466\n00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,490\nSo if you don't actually\ndo any of these rules here,\n\n467\n00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,420\nat least allowing traffic to go through.\n\n468\n00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,250\nThat firewall is really\ngoing to be a firewall,\n\n469\n00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,850\nyou're not going to get access to anything\n>> It's going to\n\n470\n00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,430\ndo it's job\n>> So\n\n471\n00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,500\nusually you have to have at least\none permit statement in there\n\n472\n00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,630\nto allow this thing to work.\n\n473\n00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,390\nIf not,\nyou're going to be very frustrated.\n\n474\n00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,330\n>> Yeah and, and\nthat's a common mistake we see,\n\n475\n00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:36,820\nI think with people setting up firewalls\ninitially when they're new at it.\n\n476\n00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,040\nIs the first thing they want to do is,\nthey want to block everything.\n\n477\n00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,510\nSo they put that deny rule at the very\ntop that says block everything.\n\n478\n00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,800\nAnd then they start deciding\nwhat they want to allow.\n\n479\n00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,116\nSo they go back and underneath that\ndeny all, they add the allow port 80 for\n\n480\n00:22:49,116 --> 00:22:52,660\nmy web traffic, allow port 443 for\nmy secure web traffic.\n\n481\n00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,850\nAnd then they can't\nfigure out why anything,\n\n482\n00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,120\nwhy nothing can make it\nto their web server.\n\n483\n00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,420\nBecause, again,\nit processes those, those a,\n\n484\n00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,480\nthat access control list gets\nprocessed in that order, and\n\n485\n00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,900\nthe first one that matches,\nthat's the only one it's gonna use.\n\n486\n00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,490\nIt's not that it gets to try this one,\nand then try this one, and\n\n487\n00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,525\nthen try the third one and\ngo, ooh, this one I like.\n\n488\n00:23:10,525 --> 00:23:12,260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's the first one that matches,\n\n489\n00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,070\nthat's the one that applies.\n\n490\n00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,140\nSo you've gotta make sure that\nyou have your most specific\n\n491\n00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,080\nrules up at the top of the list.\n\n492\n00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,920\nAnd they get more general as you go.\n\n493\n00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,180\n>> Yeah that's a great\nreminder because one of the,\n\n494\n00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:26,660\nthe easy things that ends up happening is,\nis like me the very first time I set up I\n\n495\n00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,680\nwas like, all right I've turned it on,\nI see blinking lights.\n\n496\n00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,060\nI can't get anything through and\nthen I had to go back and examine it.\n\n497\n00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,810\nAnd when I finally did, and\nI opened up the firewall rules there,\n\n498\n00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:39,660\nthe only rule that was listed\nwas this last one right here.\n\n499\n00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,490\nWhich said, deny everything.\n\n500\n00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,067\nSo that means above it, I have to\nactually permit other things to actually\n\n501\n00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:47,444\nbe able to get access and,\nand even out at times.\n\n502\n00:23:47,444 --> 00:23:50,351\nSo just kind of remember,\nthat this is what we,\n\n503\n00:23:50,351 --> 00:23:54,142\nwe tend to see as far as the basic\nfunction of these firewalls.\n\n504\n00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:57,517\nAlright, so one more thing I think we\nwanna talk about with firewalls was,\n\n505\n00:23:57,517 --> 00:23:59,350\nlet's do a little comparison between.\n\n506\n00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:02,650\n>> Okay.\n>> Say the web application firewalls, and\n\n507\n00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,070\nour network based firewalls.\n\n508\n00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:08,350\nCuz they are kind of similar and,\nwell, they are similar.\n\n509\n00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,125\nLet's just leave it at that.\n\n510\n00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:09,625\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n511\n00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:10,530\nThey're very similar\n\n512\n00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,320\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n513\n00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,150\nAnd I made a little table here.\n\n514\n00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,080\nAnd we'll actually share this table out,\nwhen we, when we take a look.\n\n515\n00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,865\nSo, down here, at the bottom of the,\nthe screen, when we start comparing them,\n\n516\n00:24:21,865 --> 00:24:24,090\ncause this is something that they\nreally want you to focus in on,\n\n517\n00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,800\nthey even call it out in\nthe exam objectives here.\n\n518\n00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:32,190\nA, a web app firewall versus a, network\nfirewall or the network-based firewall.\n\n519\n00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,730\nIf you do the comparison,\nreally, at the beginning,\n\n520\n00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,800\nhere are some of the things that you\nwant to make sure that you understand.\n\n521\n00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:42,340\nRemember that in, because we're talking\nabout network security devices, right?\n\n522\n00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,010\nWe need to understand where these\nthings work at the OSI model.\n\n523\n00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,500\nSo when you end up comparing them,\n\n524\n00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,230\nyou actually end up seeing like,\nthe application layer of firewall,\n\n525\n00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,570\nthe web app firewall, works at layer\nseven, so it's on the application layer.\n\n526\n00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:56,420\nThat's what I was tryin' to say,\nI've said it like nine times.\n\n527\n00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,150\nAnd then the network firewall usually\nworks at the transport layer, and\n\n528\n00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,510\nthe of course network layer itself.\n\n529\n00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,700\nSo those are really\nthe primary responsibilities.\n\n530\n00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,400\nNow we're gonna see something\na little bit further on down line,\n\n531\n00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,605\nthat even today these lines are actually\ngetting more and more blurred.\n\n532\n00:25:10,605 --> 00:25:12,620\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But we're really at the beginning,\n\n533\n00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,580\nat least for the net, for the net.\n\n534\n00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,130\n>> The security plus.\n\n535\n00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,830\n>> Security plus exam.\n\n536\n00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,140\nWe're gonna end up seeing and\nhear some of the distinctions, too.\n\n537\n00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,170\nIn its overall function,\n\n538\n00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:25,310\nnotice that on the web app firewall,\nit is looking at the data stream itself,.\n\n539\n00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,690\nSo it's really looking at what\ntype of data is coming in\n\n540\n00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,280\nwhereas on the network firewall a lot\nof times we can deny on source or\n\n541\n00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:37,430\nallow based on source, we can allow or\ndeny based on source and destination and\n\n542\n00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:42,150\nthen it can actually inspect the traffic\nitself if it needs to, so it actually does\n\n543\n00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,150\nwhat we call packet inspection to verify\nthat this is going to where it actually\n\n544\n00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:49,870\nsays its going to, so it based on\nfunctionality that's what we also have.\n\n545\n00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:53,590\nAnd notice the way that it ends up\nworking the firewall rules out.\n\n546\n00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:57,320\nWeb app firewalls tend to also use\ndefinitions just like we do in our,\n\n547\n00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,390\nmalware detection stuff.\n\n548\n00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:04,270\nIt can do logging, it can do additional\nreporting, it can do everything that we\n\n549\n00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:08,730\nneed it do so that we can actually have\nstatistics that help to show what we need.\n\n550\n00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,480\nReally network firewalls,\nthey really do 90% of what they do\n\n551\n00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,410\nis really based on what we call\nthose Access Control Lists.\n\n552\n00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:18,320\nThe ones that we talked about the more\nspecific up at top working towards that's\n\n553\n00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,730\nmost general.\n\n554\n00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,290\nBut even though all of\nthese are security devices,\n\n555\n00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,185\nthere are some general weaknesses to them.\n\n556\n00:26:24,185 --> 00:26:24,750\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n557\n00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,279\n>> So,\nnotice that because it is an application,\n\n558\n00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,040\nright,\n>> Denial of service, back doors,\n\n559\n00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,630\nthere's other things that every\napplication, that we've got to monitor.\n\n560\n00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:38,026\nAnd even the web application firewalls,\nthey're susceptible to the same thing that\n\n561\n00:26:38,026 --> 00:26:41,314\nother application attacks\nare susceptible to.\n\n562\n00:26:41,314 --> 00:26:46,380\nAnd on the network firewall, one of the\nweird things that we have to understand,\n\n563\n00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,620\nespecially if we start allowing\nVPNs to come through our firewall,\n\n564\n00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:54,040\nright, the firewall doesn't expect\ntraffic inside of VPN tunnels, so\n\n565\n00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,580\nif somebody's able to figure out how\nto get a VPN connection in, well,\n\n566\n00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,360\nthe firewall doesn't look\ninside the VPN tunnel.\n\n567\n00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,270\nIt just says, yeah, I'm supposed to\nallow this tunnel to come through.\n\n568\n00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,445\n>> Typically that's encrypted.\n\n569\n00:27:03,445 --> 00:27:04,600\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's not able to look at those\n\n570\n00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,120\npackages.\n\n571\n00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,570\n>> Yeah, yeah, so it's not able to.\n\n572\n00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,980\nSo tunneling, overruns, you name it.\n\n573\n00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,050\nSome spoofing can go on where\nit actually can do that.\n\n574\n00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:15,150\nSo there are some inherent\nweaknesses to these devices.\n\n575\n00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:19,940\nBut depending on what you need right,\nif you really need to have protection and\n\n576\n00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,730\nreally not be impacted by performance,\nthe network firewall, but\n\n577\n00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,460\nremember that the web app\nwhen it looks at everything.\n\n578\n00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,460\nIt looks at everything and\n\n579\n00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,280\nthings do slow down a little bit\nwhen that ends up happening.\n\n580\n00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:34,170\nSo you may have to implement more\ntypes of performance controls there,\n\n581\n00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,360\nsuch as quality of service and\n\n582\n00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,790\nsome other things that you might have\nto do to get everything back on track.\n\n583\n00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,190\nBut yeah,\nthere's a big comparison there, and, and\n\n584\n00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,450\nwhen people wonder what the difference is,\nit's right here.\n\n585\n00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,490\n>> Yeah, and it's important that\nwe understand that for the exam,\n\n586\n00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:48,640\nbecause we need to know which device\nwe're gonna use in what scenario.\n\n587\n00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,110\nSo if they tell us we're trying to\nprotect a particular web application, and\n\n588\n00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,000\nthey're not gonna make it quite that\nobvious but you know, if the gist of\n\n589\n00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,290\nthe scenario is that you're trying\nto protect a particular application.\n\n590\n00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:01,220\nAnd you need it to look at that data and\nfigure out if its, if it should\n\n591\n00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,470\nbe going to that application or not,\nthe web app firewall is the way to go.\n\n592\n00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,070\nIf you're trying to protect a,\n\n593\n00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:10,220\nan entire subnet, then the network\nfirewall is going to be the way to go.\n\n594\n00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,210\nOr we can use our access control list\nto control, they might tell you,\n\n595\n00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:16,090\nhey you only want,\nyou want to limit traffic to this subnet,\n\n596\n00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:20,110\nonly traffic that originates\nfrom a particular network range,\n\n597\n00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:23,140\nthat's when that network firewall\nis going to be what we need to do.\n\n598\n00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,780\n>> Right.\n\n599\n00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,740\n>> All right, well, Ronnie,\nwe covered firewalls pretty good.\n\n600\n00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,470\nAnything else we need to throw in there?\n\n601\n00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:31,290\n>> Just remember that you're\ngoing to see these firewalls\n\n602\n00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,618\njust about in every network that you come\ninto contact with when you're working as\n\n603\n00:28:34,618 --> 00:28:36,020\na security professional.\n\n604\n00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,430\n>> Whether it's in a home environment or\n\n605\n00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:40,100\nnot, you'll probably see some of\nthem in the home environments.\n\n606\n00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,180\nIf you're like me, you, you end up\ninheriting some of them [LAUGH] you end up\n\n607\n00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,680\nbuying some of them cause you're like,\nI got to learn more about it.\n\n608\n00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,535\nBut you end up having some of these\ndevices and it's always good.\n\n609\n00:28:48,535 --> 00:28:51,505\n>> But start off with some\na little bit of practice here but\n\n610\n00:28:51,505 --> 00:28:54,000\nget familiar with at least\nthe basics of what they do,\n\n611\n00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,070\ncause it's gonna be very important for\nyou as a security professional.\n\n612\n00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,135\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Even if you don't touch it and\n\n613\n00:28:58,135 --> 00:28:59,185\nyou don't implement it.\n\n614\n00:28:59,185 --> 00:29:01,545\nUnderstanding the logic\nbehind it is really helpful.\n\n615\n00:29:01,545 --> 00:29:03,645\n>> Absolutely.\nAlright, well I'll tell you what.\n\n616\n00:29:03,645 --> 00:29:05,755\nLadies and gentlemen,\nit's about time for us to take a break.\n\n617\n00:29:05,755 --> 00:29:07,195\nSo why don't we stop here.\n\n618\n00:29:07,195 --> 00:29:08,815\nWhen we come back we're gonna continue on.\n\n619\n00:29:08,815 --> 00:29:11,685\nWe're gonna take a look at some other\ntypes of devices like routers and\n\n620\n00:29:11,685 --> 00:29:12,540\nswitches.\n\n621\n00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:16,932\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n622\n00:29:16,932 --> 00:29:22,900\n[SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n623\n00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,847\nSo we left off with we were talking about\nour fire walls and, and now we're gonna\n\n624\n00:29:26,847 --> 00:29:30,406\ntalk about some other devices that we\ncan use to keep our network secure, and\n\n625\n00:29:30,406 --> 00:29:34,189\ntalk about where we're gonna put these in\nthe overall layout of our network, and\n\n626\n00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,220\nI think next on the list,\nRonnie, is gonna be routers.\n\n627\n00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:37,900\n>> Right.\n\n628\n00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,730\nWhen we start taking a look at some\nof the different network devices\n\n629\n00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:43,100\nthat actually can also\nbe security devices,\n\n630\n00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,650\nrouters may not be the first thing\non your mind as a security device.\n\n631\n00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:50,540\nBut it really is at the very edge of our\nnetwork the majority of the times, right?\n\n632\n00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,580\nWhen we connect out to the internet or\nwe connect to our ISP.\n\n633\n00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,440\nUsually the router is the first\ndevice that's right there, and\n\n634\n00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,040\nwe can implement some basic security on\nthat router that really can help us to\n\n635\n00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,670\nweed out a lot of traffic before it\nactually even gets inside of our network.\n\n636\n00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:08,420\nSo what we wanna do is make sure that you\nunderstand in what a router actually does\n\n637\n00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,610\nand where we normally see it.\n\n638\n00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,290\nSo on my screen again, I went and\n\n639\n00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:15,250\nmade just a simple diagram\nto help us to understand.\n\n640\n00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,700\nRouters really help us to\nseparate out different networks.\n\n641\n00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,680\nSo, whenever we actually\nplug a cable into a router,\n\n642\n00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,560\nwe're pretty much saying that those\nare actually on separate networks.\n\n643\n00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,040\nThe majority of times that we're\nonly a small network or so, we might\n\n644\n00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:34,070\nplug our internal switch into this router\nand then outside normally goes to our ISP.\n\n645\n00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,670\nAnd that's pretty much all that,\nthat we tend to do.\n\n646\n00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:40,380\nBut I can have an internal\nrouter that could separate out\n\n647\n00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:44,450\nmultiple LANs inside of my\nown network if I choose to.\n\n648\n00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:48,390\nBy running them through the router, it\nactually does keep them separated out so\n\n649\n00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:53,230\nthat my broadcast traffic stays only\nwithin my own local area network.\n\n650\n00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,450\nUsually the security\nconfigurations that we put on here\n\n651\n00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:59,280\nare the beginnings of\nwhat we call IP filters.\n\n652\n00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,110\nI can block, let's say for\n\n653\n00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:05,570\nexample, the branch traffic if I wanted\nto from getting back inside the LAN.\n\n654\n00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,690\nNow that would be silly but\n\n655\n00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:09,400\nI could do it if I wanted to,\neven just using the router.\n\n656\n00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,830\nNow, do I need a firewall?\n\n657\n00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:14,830\nI may, but\nat the very basic necessity of it,\n\n658\n00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:18,410\nby using just an IP filter, I can say\nI don't want any of this traffic from\n\n659\n00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:22,470\nthis particular location to be\nable to gain access over here.\n\n660\n00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:27,430\nSo we can do that just on a router itself\nand having that basic configuration.\n\n661\n00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,980\nSo a lot of times,\nif your business can't afford both,\n\n662\n00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,960\nsometimes a router will\nactually do just fine.\n\n663\n00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,486\nThen, as you become more comfortable\nwith just doing some basic filtering,\n\n664\n00:31:36,486 --> 00:31:37,036\nlike that.\n\n665\n00:31:37,036 --> 00:31:41,556\nIt might actually be an individual\nmachine, out here, on my branch office\n\n666\n00:31:41,556 --> 00:31:45,821\nthat I don't want to connect back in to my\nLAN, or it could be a specific location\n\n667\n00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:49,353\nout on the internet that you don't\nwant people to connecting in.\n\n668\n00:31:49,353 --> 00:31:52,113\nYou can always filter out\nthat traffic fairly easily.\n\n669\n00:31:52,113 --> 00:31:55,973\nThen you can create those access control\nlists in the same way we talked about with\n\n670\n00:31:55,973 --> 00:31:57,240\nfirewall rules.\n\n671\n00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,830\nThe most specific ones at\ntop to the more general.\n\n672\n00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,920\nAnd actually implement it there too.\n\n673\n00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,510\nSo you might be wondering,\nwow, that sounds neat.\n\n674\n00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,860\nIs that something that we\ncan actually do on that?\n\n675\n00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,460\nSure thing.\nIf you want to learn more about it,\n\n676\n00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,970\nthe good thing is we have the CCNA\nsecurity episode, where we go through and\n\n677\n00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:16,200\nwe show you how to actually\nconfigure that using the router.\n\n678\n00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,300\nAnd at least la, learning the syntax\nof those access control list, so\n\n679\n00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:25,620\nthat you can have a basic understanding\nof what actually has to be configured and\n\n680\n00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,110\nwhere you're gonna actually see that.\n\n681\n00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:30,940\nSo if you really are interested that, make\nsure you take advantage of those shows.\n\n682\n00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,660\n>> Absolutely.\nSo, so routers then in our,\n\n683\n00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,660\nin our overall network layout and\n\n684\n00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,950\nthis is how we're gonna take\nthat local area network and\n\n685\n00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:42,560\ndivide it up into these broadcast domains,\nand start segregating out that traffic.\n\n686\n00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:47,260\nAnd because they do, they route\ntraffic between different subnets or\n\n687\n00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,330\nout to the outside if you need to.\n\n688\n00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:52,740\nSo I can control what traffic's allowed\nto go between those different subnets.\n\n689\n00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,580\nLike you were saying, I might have an R&D\nportion of my network, where I don't want\n\n690\n00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:02,200\nmy employees to just be able to browse\nover there and look at resources, or\n\n691\n00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,490\nconnect to file servers that are in\nthat R&D portion of the network.\n\n692\n00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,500\nThe router can do that.\n\n693\n00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,430\nThe router I can create, as Ronnie says,\n\n694\n00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:12,450\nthose access control lists,\nthat say, I don't wanna allow\n\n695\n00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:17,330\ntraffic from this source network to be\nable to get into this destination network.\n\n696\n00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,290\nWe can do it based on,\n\n697\n00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:22,870\non IP ranges, individual IP addresses,\nwe could do it on protocols too, right?\n\n698\n00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,140\nI might want to not allow FTP traffic\n\n699\n00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,230\nbetween two different\nsubnets on my network.\n\n700\n00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,780\nSo, you can use them internally\nwithin your network.\n\n701\n00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,240\nWe can put them out there\non the edge of our network,\n\n702\n00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,115\nkinda behind that firewall to route\nthat traffic to the different subnets.\n\n703\n00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:40,100\n>> Yeah, just remember that\nusually with access control lists,\n\n704\n00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,940\nespecially since you're gonna see\nthem on routers more often than not,\n\n705\n00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,820\nis there is really two basic\ntypes that you end up seeing.\n\n706\n00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,870\nOne that actually goes ahead and\ncreates a rule based on the source.\n\n707\n00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,760\nIn other words,\nwhere that traffic is coming from and\n\n708\n00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,630\nwe can either allow or deny that.\n\n709\n00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,524\nOr, we can base it on source and\ndestination.\n\n710\n00:34:00,524 --> 00:34:04,467\nI may want to allow other people to access\na particular destination, but I may want\n\n711\n00:34:04,467 --> 00:34:08,810\nto deny a source going to that destination\nso I can individually filter that out.\n\n712\n00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,580\nSo normally that's what you also\nsee in those access control lists,\n\n713\n00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,630\nis that you'll see two\ndifferent types there.\n\n714\n00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:17,040\nSo one just based on source, I want to\ndeny everything, usually is is what what\n\n715\n00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,230\nwe have or I want to allow everything\nfrom this one source to get in.\n\n716\n00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:25,320\nBut then if you wanna be very granular and\nactually block out a specific source to\n\n717\n00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,740\na specific destination,\nmy computer to Mike's computer, and\n\n718\n00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,320\nyou wanted to make sure that\nthat actually never happened,\n\n719\n00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,890\nwell you can actually do\nit based on both of those.\n\n720\n00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:36,050\nAnd then, using that,\n\n721\n00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:40,380\nit gives you that ability to also\nblock on a specific protocol.\n\n722\n00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:44,200\nI may want to allow Mike's\ncomputer access, email.\n\n723\n00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,720\nSo I can open up port 25,\nbut then I can go and\n\n724\n00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,240\ncreate another role,\nthat blocks them on web.\n\n725\n00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,040\nYou name it.\n\n726\n00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,340\nWe can actually be very grand, you know,\nwith these access control lists.\n\n727\n00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,710\nSo, it is a, at the heart of it, right?\n\n728\n00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,740\nIt really does provide\nthe most basic security.\n\n729\n00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:03,320\nSeparating out those broadcast domain,\nso that the broadcast from the R&D\n\n730\n00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,920\nthat Mike was mentioning, isn't also\ncoming across on the administration side.\n\n731\n00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,450\nWhere somebody might be sitting there\nwith a packet sniffer and go oo.\n\n732\n00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,910\nLook I'm startin to see R&D\ntraffic comin across here.\n\n733\n00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:16,180\nWe can actually block that\ntype of traffic right out.\n\n734\n00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,490\nSo the router itself can do that.\n\n735\n00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:22,360\nAnd the advantage of having it right here\nright is that that, actually makes that,\n\n736\n00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,130\nthat, that, decision while it's\nright there in the router.\n\n737\n00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:30,040\nIt doesn't actually have to do\nit once it gets past the router.\n\n738\n00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,730\nAnd a lot of times when\nwe implement a firewall,\n\n739\n00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:34,570\nwe normally actually do\nput it behind the router.\n\n740\n00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:35,510\nCan you put it someplace else?\n\n741\n00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,560\nYeah.\nBut usually you do put it\n\n742\n00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,120\nbehind the router.\n\n743\n00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,360\nYou're actually saying okay\nthe router didn't stop it.\n\n744\n00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,420\nNow the firewall has to stop it too.\n\n745\n00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,620\nSo you're giving it one\nstep closer to do that.\n\n746\n00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,320\n>> Yeah.\nThe other common thing we'll see with our\n\n747\n00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,870\nrouter implementation we've, we've talked\nabout in some other episodes, you know,\n\n748\n00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:52,290\nIP address spoofing is a way that somebody\nmight try to get into our network.\n\n749\n00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:57,020\nOur, our rules might say traffic is\nallowed to this portion of the network if\n\n750\n00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:02,380\nthe source was a particular\nsubnet range like 192.168.1.0/24.\n\n751\n00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:06,950\nSo somebody from the outside might\nfigure that out and they might\n\n752\n00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:11,630\ntry to come from the outside, through\nmy router and spoof their IP address.\n\n753\n00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:15,480\nBecause if they can spoof their IP address\nand make it look like one that's coming\n\n754\n00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,930\nfrom the inside that router\nmight allow it to go through.\n\n755\n00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,370\nSo we can create rules\nthat say there's no way\n\n756\n00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:24,370\na private range should be coming\nfrom that internet port for example.\n\n757\n00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:26,710\nSo they allow me to keep that,\nthat network secure.\n\n758\n00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:30,480\n>> And that's a great, understanding too\nespecially on basic security on the,\n\n759\n00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,570\non the router.\n\n760\n00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,240\nBecause a lot of times we\ndon't think about that,\n\n761\n00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,220\nthat somebody might actually say well,\nif I just show myself,\n\n762\n00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,980\neven though I'm out here on the internet\nas being part of that local area network.\n\n763\n00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,920\nThe router may allow it through because\nit actually says that's trusted on\n\n764\n00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,140\nthe inside so that's perfectly fine.\n\n765\n00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:48,730\nBut usually one of those basic rules that\nwe also set up on those access control\n\n766\n00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:53,420\nis to do something like that where\nwe actually deny our own subnet,\n\n767\n00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,500\ncoming in from the outside\ninterface coming in.\n\n768\n00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,750\nSo yeah, there's a lot of things that\nwe can do that are on the routers.\n\n769\n00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,380\nBut that does set up that\nprimary layer of defense.\n\n770\n00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,220\nNow because it normally is on the edge,\nit also means that we have to be\n\n771\n00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:10,120\ncareful with this device, because people\ncan go in there and they can change it.\n\n772\n00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,300\nSo that's one thing we\nhave to worry about.\n\n773\n00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,940\nUsually once you get a router right out\nof the box, we don't wanna ever put any\n\n774\n00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:21,100\ndevice into our production network without\nat least the most basic of hardening.\n\n775\n00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:25,540\nAnd so if you wanna learn more about that,\nremember those CCNA, CCENT shows.\n\n776\n00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:29,000\nWhere they go in and show you how to\nchange the basic configurations for\n\n777\n00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,380\naccess into that router, as well.\n\n778\n00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,680\nAnd so you do wanna make sure\nthat that's configured properly,\n\n779\n00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,040\nwhere somebody can't go in there.\n\n780\n00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,680\nAnd then say, all right,\n\n781\n00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,710\nI'm gonna generate a route that's actually\ngonna send all that traffic only to\n\n782\n00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:43,380\nmy destination and\nnot to anybody else that it needs to go.\n\n783\n00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,150\nIt can be done, and so\nyou have to be careful here.\n\n784\n00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:49,750\n>> And, and on the exam they're not gonna\nget us on any particular brand of router\n\n785\n00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,160\nor anything like that, but you know,\n\n786\n00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,760\nwhat are some of the different\ntypes of routers?\n\n787\n00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,760\nI might see other brands,\nother routers I might see out there.\n\n788\n00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,840\n>> Yeah, but by far, you know,\nI, I'm a Cisco guy, so\n\n789\n00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:02,090\nCisco routers are usually the most\nprolific ones that you see.\n\n790\n00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:05,350\nBut just when I say that, there are,\nof course, other brands out there.\n\n791\n00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:10,010\nJuniper, HP makes them, Nortel which\nmay have actually been bought out or\n\n792\n00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:12,650\nthey might be buying other companies too,\nbut you name it.\n\n793\n00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,530\nThese are usually big ones that\nyou also see in terms of the name,\n\n794\n00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,150\nNetgear makes some.\n\n795\n00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:20,940\nBut usually at the enterprise level or\nat the, at the business level\n\n796\n00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,480\nyou're probably gonna see people\nprobably going with the Juniper,\n\n797\n00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:28,450\nor on the Cisco routers, and you got\nthe ISP level probably still sticking\n\n798\n00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:32,185\nwith those old Nortel ones because\nthose things are massive and they work.\n\n799\n00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,790\n>> And then on the, on the home front we,\nwe see some routers too.\n\n800\n00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,860\nYou might not even realize it, but\n\n801\n00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,124\nyou're most likely running a router\n[LAUGH] at your house, right.\n\n802\n00:38:39,124 --> 00:38:43,333\nThose little wireless access points,\nthe Netgear, the Linkus, the Dealings, and\n\n803\n00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:46,138\nthings like that those are our\nmulti function devices and\n\n804\n00:38:46,138 --> 00:38:48,140\none of them is a two port router, right?\n\n805\n00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,570\nYou've got the WAN side and\nyou've got the LAN side, so\n\n806\n00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,990\nit is routing traffic from the WAN and\nLAN.\n\n807\n00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,280\nAnd you can do some basic\nconfiguration on some of those.\n\n808\n00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,455\n>> You can.\n>> You can get in there, you can\n\n809\n00:38:56,455 --> 00:38:57,235\n>> You can do some for\n\n810\n00:38:57,235 --> 00:38:59,585\nblocking, you can raise some port\nforwarding and things like that.\n\n811\n00:38:59,585 --> 00:39:04,505\nSo, all right so routers, big part of the\nsecurity, make sure we understand where\n\n812\n00:39:04,505 --> 00:39:07,455\nthose go in out Network, and\nhow they fall into security.\n\n813\n00:39:07,455 --> 00:39:10,822\nOh, one other thing I do like to mention,\nI know a lot of people think, you,\n\n814\n00:39:10,822 --> 00:39:13,607\nI don't know, we, we've had this\ndiscussion a few times here.\n\n815\n00:39:13,607 --> 00:39:14,742\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, subnets,\n\n816\n00:39:14,742 --> 00:39:16,612\nis that a, a security thing?\n\n817\n00:39:16,612 --> 00:39:20,512\nAnd the consensus is really\nnot all by itself, right.\n\n818\n00:39:20,512 --> 00:39:21,552\n>> Right.\n>> It's the router.\n\n819\n00:39:21,552 --> 00:39:24,872\nYou know, we talk about breaking our\nnetwork into smaller segments and\n\n820\n00:39:24,872 --> 00:39:27,142\ninto subnets, and people think,\noh, we do that for\n\n821\n00:39:27,142 --> 00:39:30,080\nsecurity\n>> Eh, we do, but\n\n822\n00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,520\nwithout the router there, and without\nthose rules controlling what traffic's\n\n823\n00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,010\nallowed to go between those subnets,\nit's not much of a security measure.\n\n824\n00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:40,031\n>> Yeah, the, the most basic security\nit does is really just separate\n\n825\n00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:41,780\nout that broadcast from going across.\n\n826\n00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,176\nBut, overall, though,\nthe subnetting itself,\n\n827\n00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:47,633\nreally is more about logically being\nable to manage the network better and\n\n828\n00:39:47,633 --> 00:39:50,844\nthen allowing that router to do\nthings much more efficiently.\n\n829\n00:39:50,844 --> 00:39:52,411\nWhen you have so many routes And\n\n830\n00:39:52,411 --> 00:39:55,258\nyou only really need one route\noutside of your network.\n\n831\n00:39:55,258 --> 00:39:58,811\nWell, why not try to, to do a little\nbit of, of that subnetting and\n\n832\n00:39:58,811 --> 00:40:02,440\nthen you end up being able to,\nto summarize those routes together.\n\n833\n00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,490\nSo, so\nthere's a lot of things that we can do.\n\n834\n00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:07,030\nBut, yeah it's not primarily\njust security anymore.\n\n835\n00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,720\n>> Right.\n>> But that's probably why people thought\n\n836\n00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,445\nabout it in the beginning is\ncuz all traffic was broadcast.\n\n837\n00:40:11,445 --> 00:40:12,290\n>> Right.\n>> And so\n\n838\n00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:15,060\nwhen all traffic was broadcast,\nbeing able to separate that out and\n\n839\n00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,860\ngo, hey look, my broadcasts\naren't going across to your's.\n\n840\n00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:21,511\nSo I've got some security there,\nand they had the most basic, but\n\n841\n00:40:21,511 --> 00:40:23,649\nit's not really the, the most-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n842\n00:40:23,649 --> 00:40:25,146\n>> security that we can implement.\n\n843\n00:40:25,146 --> 00:40:27,360\n>> All right, so\nwe've talked about our firewalls.\n\n844\n00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,165\nWe've talked about routers?\n\n845\n00:40:29,165 --> 00:40:32,865\nWhat's another thing we might see\nin our network that we can use for\n\n846\n00:40:32,865 --> 00:40:34,175\nkeeping our network secure?\n\n847\n00:40:34,175 --> 00:40:37,245\n>> One of the things we also have inside\na router network in terms of different\n\n848\n00:40:37,245 --> 00:40:40,735\ndevices is going to be what we\ncall of course the network switch.\n\n849\n00:40:40,735 --> 00:40:43,475\nNow one of the things we didn't mention,\nwe probably should have\n\n850\n00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:46,825\nis where these devices tend to also\noperate on the OSI model, too.\n\n851\n00:40:46,825 --> 00:40:47,485\n>> Hm.\n>> Remember that,\n\n852\n00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:50,390\nthat routers operate on later\nthree of the OSI model.\n\n853\n00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:53,880\nAnd as I went to, to, to see the, the\ndiagram of the switch I was like, oh yeah,\n\n854\n00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,665\nI've got to remember that.\n\n855\n00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:58,610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Switches tend to work at layer two.\n\n856\n00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:02,140\nAnd you might be saying well what's\nthe real big difference between them?\n\n857\n00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:06,220\nWell, remember that when we talked about\nthe way that the routers tend to function\n\n858\n00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,718\nat the edge of the network, and\nusing those access control lists,\n\n859\n00:41:08,718 --> 00:41:09,920\naccess control lists.\n\n860\n00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,430\nThey are based on the IP addresses, right?\n\n861\n00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,530\nAnd whether it's the source,\nor whether it's the source and\n\n862\n00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,230\ndestination that we're,\nwe're blocking on or\n\n863\n00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:21,310\nwe're allowing to come in,\nit's based on that layer three address.\n\n864\n00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:24,178\nSwitches know nothing about\nthe layer three address.\n\n865\n00:41:24,178 --> 00:41:26,285\nAt least, the, the regular old switches.\n\n866\n00:41:26,285 --> 00:41:28,170\nWe, we can talk about\nsomething a little bit, el,\n\n867\n00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:30,820\nelse, which we call a layer\nthree switch that can do it.\n\n868\n00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,840\nBut, normal switches when we\ntalk about are all layer two.\n\n869\n00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:38,340\nWhich means, they work based\non MAC addresses themselves.\n\n870\n00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:42,320\nSo, where do we normally find\nregular layer two switches?\n\n871\n00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:47,000\nWell, we normally find them, really,\nin the heart and center of our networks.\n\n872\n00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,260\nSo, this is,\nis not primarily an edge device.\n\n873\n00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:54,680\nIt's not a network edge device like\na router and even a firewall at times.\n\n874\n00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,440\nThis is normally just a basic connectivity\ndevice that we can now actually take\n\n875\n00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,270\nall the devices inside of our network,\ncable them, and plug them right\n\n876\n00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:07,910\ninto that switch, and they now have\ngood interconnectivity between them.\n\n877\n00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:11,150\nBut the way that it ends up working,\nalso works as a security measure.\n\n878\n00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:15,420\nSo let me ahead and show you a, a small\nexample of what I'm talking about here.\n\n879\n00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:19,450\nSo, when we plug these\ndevices into a switch,\n\n880\n00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:23,470\nwhat ends up happening is that those\ndevices when they start to communicate,\n\n881\n00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:26,390\nthey will end up sending\nessentially their MAC address.\n\n882\n00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,590\nAnd that will get stored\ninto a table here, and\n\n883\n00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:32,910\nthat will associate a port\nnumber with that MAC address.\n\n884\n00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,310\nNow when we start implementing that,\n\n885\n00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:37,180\nwe can actually have as many MAC\naddresses on any one port that we have.\n\n886\n00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:40,700\nIn other words, I can take 15 computers\nand actually just keep plugging and\n\n887\n00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,430\nunplugging, and\nmaking sure I'm sending traffic, and\n\n888\n00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:47,540\nthat will continue to populate that table\nand do everything that, that we want to.\n\n889\n00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:51,980\nThat's a bad thing, but that's the default\nconfiguration on these device.\n\n890\n00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,440\nSo, working as a security measure though,\n\n891\n00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,360\nwhat I can do is I can\nimplement security in this way.\n\n892\n00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,910\nWhere I sit there and\nsay on this little five port switch here.\n\n893\n00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,400\nI know that that's kind of,\nit's a little bit of an anomaly, but\n\n894\n00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,515\nthis is the drawing that we have.\n\n895\n00:43:03,515 --> 00:43:05,825\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> On this little five port switch,\n\n896\n00:43:05,825 --> 00:43:09,935\nwhat I can actually do is go ahead and\nsay, hey, on each port,\n\n897\n00:43:09,935 --> 00:43:14,865\nI only wanna allow one MAC address,\nand I can type that MAC address in.\n\n898\n00:43:14,865 --> 00:43:19,260\nSo that if anybody else plugs a different\ncomputer into that port, it says,\n\n899\n00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:24,080\nI'm not letting you get access in by,\nby that MAC address.\n\n900\n00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,550\nSo in that sense,\nit can become what we call,\n\n901\n00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:31,920\na very much, a port security device,\nwhere it locks down that port.\n\n902\n00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,920\nSometimes those ports can\nactually be locked down for\n\n903\n00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,640\njust a specific amount of time and\nthen opens up again.\n\n904\n00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,540\nBut the way that I like to set it up is,\n\n905\n00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,110\nif it gets locked out because\nsomebody's unplugged it and\n\n906\n00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:44,150\nplugged another device into it,\nthat they have to come and talk to me.\n\n907\n00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:47,350\nIn other words, I locked it out to\nthe point where they have to come and\n\n908\n00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:51,310\nget me to administratively\nturn that port back on.\n\n909\n00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:53,765\nSo there's a lot of control\nthat we can do here.\n\n910\n00:43:53,765 --> 00:43:56,805\nSo normally when you hear about\nsecurity at the switch level,\n\n911\n00:43:56,805 --> 00:44:01,310\nthat's what they're generally talking\nabout is what we call port security.\n\n912\n00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,562\n>> Hm-hm.\n>> Now if you work with multiple switches,\n\n913\n00:44:03,562 --> 00:44:06,666\nthey can also do the same thing\neven between multiple switches,\n\n914\n00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:09,390\nimplementing a basic\ntype of authentication.\n\n915\n00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:12,062\nSo, if somebody doesn't just\ntake a news switch and go,\n\n916\n00:44:12,062 --> 00:44:14,973\nI wonder if I can get traffic\nflowing through this new switch.\n\n917\n00:44:14,973 --> 00:44:16,761\n>> Hm-hm.\n>> If they just plugged it into one of\n\n918\n00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:19,590\nports, and\nthat way they start learning about it.\n\n919\n00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:22,300\nSo instead, they can actually\neven implement stuff like that,\n\n920\n00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:24,390\nthat actually makes it much more secure.\n\n921\n00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:25,628\nSo usually these switches,\n\n922\n00:44:25,628 --> 00:44:28,730\nthere's a lot of security\nconfiguration that can be done.\n\n923\n00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:29,870\nBut those are usually the,\n\n924\n00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:32,600\nthe most basic when we start\ntalking about stuff like that.\n\n925\n00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,850\nNow, remember again, if you're going man,\nhow do I learn how to do that?\n\n926\n00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:38,120\nWell, take a look at the CCNA shows.\n\n927\n00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,270\nRemember that as a subscriber,\nyou have access to everything.\n\n928\n00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,120\nSo you might as well jump over there and\n\n929\n00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,600\ntake a look at some of the basic\nswitch configurations too.\n\n930\n00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,300\nOn the exam,\nit's just understanding how that switch\n\n931\n00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,975\nnormally is going to be located\ninside your network, and\n\n932\n00:44:51,975 --> 00:44:55,618\nwhat you can do as a basic security\nmeasure in the implementation.\n\n933\n00:44:55,618 --> 00:44:56,975\n>> Hm-hm.\n>> Just like everything else,\n\n934\n00:44:56,975 --> 00:45:01,145\none of the hard things about at, at least\nCisco's switches, which is kind of counter\n\n935\n00:45:01,145 --> 00:45:06,722\nintuitive, is that you can buy a $3,000\nCisco switch or, right away, Mike.\n\n936\n00:45:06,722 --> 00:45:08,322\n>> Hm.\n>> And pull it right out the box,\n\n937\n00:45:08,322 --> 00:45:10,262\nplug it in, and\nstart plugging computers in.\n\n938\n00:45:10,262 --> 00:45:10,773\nIt works.\n\n939\n00:45:10,773 --> 00:45:12,362\n>> Yeah.\n>> It just, it just works.\n\n940\n00:45:12,362 --> 00:45:14,122\nIt doesn't have any security.\n\n941\n00:45:14,122 --> 00:45:17,820\nIt's, every port's turned on,\neverything is actually on.\n\n942\n00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,765\nAnd so, by itself,\nit's the dumbest thing in the world.\n\n943\n00:45:20,765 --> 00:45:21,730\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> If you don't\n\n944\n00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:24,350\nimplement the basic security measures.\n\n945\n00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,070\nSo normally,\nturning off ports you don't use,\n\n946\n00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:29,810\nif you have a 48 port switch and you're\nonly use 5, well turn off the other 33.\n\n947\n00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,205\nYou can do stuff stuff like that,\nbut people don't.\n\n948\n00:45:32,205 --> 00:45:35,320\nAnd that's when, now somebody goes in,\nand they walk right in, and\n\n949\n00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,130\nthey plug it into another port,\nport lights up.\n\n950\n00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,905\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And they now have access in.\n\n951\n00:45:38,905 --> 00:45:40,745\nSo you've gotta be careful here, but\n\n952\n00:45:40,745 --> 00:45:42,285\nthere's a lot of security\nyou can implement.\n\n953\n00:45:42,285 --> 00:45:43,780\nSo that's what I was showing here.\n\n954\n00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:47,280\nIs that this device is not actually\nable to get implemented into this MAC\n\n955\n00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,600\naddress table, and if they can't, they\nwill not get traffic flowing through it.\n\n956\n00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,706\n>> Right.\nAnd, and keep in mind too just\n\n957\n00:45:52,706 --> 00:45:55,120\nto make sure we're clear on that,\nwe just got that port number chart there.\n\n958\n00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,520\nWe're not talking about\nout ports as in protocols.\n\n959\n00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,827\n>> Right.\n>> We're talking about ports on\n\n960\n00:45:58,827 --> 00:45:59,570\nthe switch itself.\n\n961\n00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:01,980\nSo if it's a five port switch or\nwhat have you.\n\n962\n00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,430\nAnd, you know, in another way we\nsee switches providing security for\n\n963\n00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:06,580\nour network, I think.\n\n964\n00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:09,935\nRemember, before we had\nswitches we used hubs, right?\n\n965\n00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:10,930\n>> Right.\n>> And with a hub,\n\n966\n00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:13,800\nif you remember back to your network plus,\nand if you don't, go back and\n\n967\n00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,766\nwatch those episodes.\n\n968\n00:46:14,766 --> 00:46:17,589\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hubs spit all traffic out all ports.\n\n969\n00:46:17,589 --> 00:46:21,350\nIt didn't know, it didn't have any way\nto look at the addressing information,\n\n970\n00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:24,340\neither layer two or\nlayer three on those packets.\n\n971\n00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,820\nA switch stepped it up a notch,\nall of a sudden the switch,\n\n972\n00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,050\nas Ronnie just diagrammed out,\nis looking at that MAC address.\n\n973\n00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:31,590\nAnd it can allow, you know,\n\n974\n00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:35,520\nit learns what I, what MAC addresses\nare connect to different ports.\n\n975\n00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,110\nAnd then it only allows that traffic in.\n\n976\n00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:41,050\nAnd then the destination, if it, if the\ndestination MAC address is on one of those\n\n977\n00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:44,600\nports, it spits it out that port,\nbut not the other ones.\n\n978\n00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,390\nSo it might not seem like security.\n\n979\n00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:49,040\nIt's like well Mike how is\nthat helping me with security?\n\n980\n00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,850\nWell now basically everybody has a point\nto point connection with that switch.\n\n981\n00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:57,670\nSo let's say I fire up Wireshark, and\nI want to try to capture traffic,\n\n982\n00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:00,300\nI want to start looking at other traffic\nthat's going across the network.\n\n983\n00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,420\nWhat am I gonna see, Ronnie?\n\n984\n00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,180\n>> The only thing you're\ngonna end up seeing is,\n\n985\n00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:05,895\nwell the traffic that's coming to you,\nor leaving you.\n\n986\n00:47:05,895 --> 00:47:06,820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it's not gonna be on\n\n987\n00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,000\neverything else.\n\n988\n00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,190\nOn a regular hub,\nI can just plug my computer into that and\n\n989\n00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:13,335\nrun some type of packet\ncapturing software.\n\n990\n00:47:13,335 --> 00:47:16,970\nAnd because every port actually spits\nit out every other port except for\n\n991\n00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:20,070\nthe one it came in on,\nI will see everybody's traffic.\n\n992\n00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:23,740\nSo a switch does implement some,\nsome nice point to point or\n\n993\n00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,971\nport to port connections for us.\n\n994\n00:47:25,971 --> 00:47:27,888\n>> Hm-hm.\n>> Which also helps with efficiency and\n\n995\n00:47:27,888 --> 00:47:30,376\nhelps with us being able to do\na whole bunch of other things,\n\n996\n00:47:30,376 --> 00:47:33,595\nespecially since it makes it's\ndecision based on that MAC address.\n\n997\n00:47:33,595 --> 00:47:35,240\n>> Hm-hm.\n>> There are ways to overcome that,\n\n998\n00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,010\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n999\n00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:37,048\nBut inside of, at least,\n\n1000\n00:47:37,048 --> 00:47:39,610\nI know Cisco switched cuz that's\nthe one I primarily work with.\n\n1001\n00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:43,432\nYou can implement incredible levels of\nsecurity just on that device itself to\n\n1002\n00:47:43,432 --> 00:47:46,019\nmake sure that nobody's\nmessing with that device,\n\n1003\n00:47:46,019 --> 00:47:49,152\nby just being able to plug something\nin and, and bring it down.\n\n1004\n00:47:49,152 --> 00:47:51,443\nSo, usually, that's the only\nthing we're really worried about,\n\n1005\n00:47:51,443 --> 00:47:52,912\nit's somebody bringing down that switch.\n\n1006\n00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:53,520\nRight.\n\n1007\n00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,598\n>> Cuz that device is actually\ndesigned to make the,\n\n1008\n00:47:55,598 --> 00:47:57,480\nthe most efficient\nconnections it can make.\n\n1009\n00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,830\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1010\n00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,870\nAll right.\nSo we got our switches.\n\n1011\n00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:03,810\nAnother thing we wanna talk about\nis gonna be load balancers.\n\n1012\n00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,610\n>> Right.\n>> Where do we see the load balancers\n\n1013\n00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:08,540\nfit into our overall network design there,\nRonnie?\n\n1014\n00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:11,010\n>> Yeah, let's take a look at\na diagram that I drew that,\n\n1015\n00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:14,320\nthat can kind of help us out and, and\ntake a look at some of the things.\n\n1016\n00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,530\nNow, of all the things that, that kind of,\n\n1017\n00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:20,090\nalways got me at the beginning is when I\nstarted to realize, like, why in the world\n\n1018\n00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:23,115\nwould the load balancer be considered\nsome type of security device?\n\n1019\n00:48:23,115 --> 00:48:24,840\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It really doesn't make sense to me.\n\n1020\n00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,280\nA load balancer does\nexactly like it sounds.\n\n1021\n00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,540\nIt divides up a heavy load for us to\nbe able to make the connections that we\n\n1022\n00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:35,290\nwant to make and that way keeping,\nyou know, things running and, you know,\n\n1023\n00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,720\nnice and smooth,\nbetter performance and stuff.\n\n1024\n00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,600\nUsually, where we see the load balancer\nis right here, in between that.\n\n1025\n00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,700\nSo, here on the right hand side is\nmy router that normally sits at\n\n1026\n00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,830\nthe edge of my network.\n\n1027\n00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:47,530\nNotice over here on the left hand side,\nthe switch which\n\n1028\n00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:49,420\nnormally connects everything\ntogether really at the heart and\n\n1029\n00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:54,650\ncenter of the network, but if I'm doing\nload balancing, I wanna put that really in\n\n1030\n00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:58,700\nbetween here between the edge,\nand on also this switch.\n\n1031\n00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:02,750\nSo notice I have two different web servers\nthat are, are continuing to go on, and\n\n1032\n00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:05,900\nlet's see if I can actually do\na little bit of a drawing here.\n\n1033\n00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:09,060\nSo let's say that what ends up\nhappening is that you're connecting to\n\n1034\n00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,000\nwhat my website here.\n\n1035\n00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,060\nAnd so normally you'd come\nin from the Internet, and\n\n1036\n00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,340\nthen you'd go to that web server.\n\n1037\n00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:18,342\nAnd that is such a nice, thick line\nthat we can see the whole thing.\n\n1038\n00:49:18,342 --> 00:49:18,927\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n1039\n00:49:18,927 --> 00:49:21,742\nit's such an incredibly\n[CROSSTALK] great color, yeah.\n\n1040\n00:49:21,742 --> 00:49:23,700\nIt's so neat, isn't it.\n\n1041\n00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,670\nFor us to,\nto be able to do something like that.\n\n1042\n00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:28,590\nlet me change the color\nas the default there.\n\n1043\n00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,270\nSo you actually are connecting in.\n\n1044\n00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:33,800\nWhat the problem that we can have\nof course then, is that as more and\n\n1045\n00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:38,285\nmore people get connected and, and I'm\ngonna regret actually turning that off,\n\n1046\n00:49:38,285 --> 00:49:41,440\nI'm not, yep, see I told you,\nI am going to regret that.\n\n1047\n00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,650\nI shouldn't have turned that off but\nI did.\n\n1048\n00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:48,400\nSo as more and more people come in,\nthat is what is going to end up happening.\n\n1049\n00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:50,490\nOh look, see.\n\n1050\n00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:52,460\nYeah, I mean, how intuitive is that?\n\n1051\n00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,270\nNice.\n>> So basically,\n\n1052\n00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:56,690\nall of our traffic at this point is\nflowing to that single web server.\n\n1053\n00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:57,250\n>> Correct.\n\n1054\n00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:02,520\n>> And, hey, we've grown as a company and\nthat web server's no longer able to handle\n\n1055\n00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,890\nall of the requests that\nare coming into it.\n\n1056\n00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:06,400\nIt can't handle that workload.\n\n1057\n00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,430\n>> Right.\n>> So, the load balancer then\n\n1058\n00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:12,270\nis what's going to allow me to take those\nrequests and allow me to split them up or\n\n1059\n00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:14,130\ndivide them between multiple nodes.\n\n1060\n00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:18,270\nWe can add a second, a third, a fourth\nweb server, and then just have that load\n\n1061\n00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:22,490\nbalancer redirect those requests and\nsplit it up maybe 25% on each\n\n1062\n00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:26,160\none if I have four of them, or however we\nchoose to do that, that division there.\n\n1063\n00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,420\n>> So the load balancer should allow me\ninstead to be able to divide that up, and\n\n1064\n00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:35,460\nsend some traffic over here and\nof course some traffic over there.\n\n1065\n00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:39,810\nAnd that is really what we're hoping\nto do with the overall load balancer.\n\n1066\n00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:41,310\nOh look.\nI was able to actually grab all\n\n1067\n00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:42,040\nof them at one time.\n\n1068\n00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,395\nI've never had that happen before.\n\n1069\n00:50:43,395 --> 00:50:44,300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that way\n\n1070\n00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,750\nit does help us divide up the load.\n\n1071\n00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:50,200\nNow you're probably saying, well that\nsounds good but how is that security?\n\n1072\n00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,632\n>> You know,\nthat was my next question, Ronnie.\n\n1073\n00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:52,890\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] >> I see that that's great.\n\n1074\n00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:56,700\nSo now my web server's not being taxed\nand, and I can divide that workload up,\n\n1075\n00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,490\nand so I'm getting better performance for\n\n1076\n00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:03,100\nmy customers that are buying my product\nbut how does that help me, security wise?\n\n1077\n00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:03,920\n>> Yeah.\n>> All it's doing is\n\n1078\n00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,120\nsplitting the traffic.\n\n1079\n00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,950\nIf one of those traffics is bad traffic,\nit's still going to get directed, right?\n\n1080\n00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:11,920\n>> Yeah, that's one of the weird\nthings until yes, you go,\n\n1081\n00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,080\noh, it makes sense when we start\nactually looking at it this way.\n\n1082\n00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,240\nSo Mike, if we were to do\na denial of service attack on\n\n1083\n00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,880\nweb server 1 here on my diagram, right?\n\n1084\n00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,040\nWe would just send all the traffic\nthat we can just to web server 1.\n\n1085\n00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,280\nMakes sense, right?\n\n1086\n00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,900\nEverything would actually do that way.\n\n1087\n00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:30,030\nAnd then after we actually overload\nit as much as we can, well,\n\n1088\n00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:31,000\nthen that thing goes down.\n\n1089\n00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,420\nAnd we're perfectly fine with it.\n\n1090\n00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:36,120\nNormally web server 1, web server 2\nwould have two different IP addresses.\n\n1091\n00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,150\nAnd so we would crash 1.\n\n1092\n00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:39,740\nAnd then we'd start working\non crashing number 2, right?\n\n1093\n00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:42,680\nThat's just the way that,\nthat we could actually end up doing that.\n\n1094\n00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:46,160\nBut with the load balancer,\nwhat essentially ends up happening here\n\n1095\n00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,190\nis that the load balancer creates\na virtual web server on it.\n\n1096\n00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,110\nNow, what does that mean?\n\n1097\n00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:56,380\nWe take a third IP address and inside\nof that load balancers instead it says,\n\n1098\n00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:01,010\nwell, Ronnie, this is what's going to\nhappen in the middle of this attack.\n\n1099\n00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:03,550\nInstead, if we go ahead and say hey,\n\n1100\n00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:08,690\nwe're actually normally doing our regular\ntypes of traffic going across here.\n\n1101\n00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:12,250\nAnd all the sudden, it actually says,\nthe load balancer says look,\n\n1102\n00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,520\nI'm starting to see too much traffic,\nlet's go ahead and start dividing it up.\n\n1103\n00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,370\nRight?\n\n1104\n00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:21,040\nSo, what if about 50% of\nthe bandwidth of web server one,\n\n1105\n00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:27,700\nthe load balancer automatically\nstarted sending it over to number two?\n\n1106\n00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:31,450\n>> So, now my attack that I'm trying\nto launch against this web server.\n\n1107\n00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:36,410\nIs actually being divided up between all\nof the nodes behind that load balancer.\n\n1108\n00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:38,700\nSo when I thought I was\nhitting a single machine.\n\n1109\n00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,890\nI'm actually attacking four\ndifferent machines, and\n\n1110\n00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:42,990\nmy attack is probably not\ngoing to be as successful.\n\n1111\n00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:46,100\n>> Right, so yeah,\nthat load balancer really does help out.\n\n1112\n00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,180\nEven when I'm like, I was looking.\n\n1113\n00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,660\nI was like I don't know.\n\n1114\n00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,380\nBut at the very end right.\n\n1115\n00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,960\nBecause we can distribute\nthe load of that attack.\n\n1116\n00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,640\nIt could be where that first attack starts\ndying down a little bit, because now all\n\n1117\n00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,860\nthe traffic is actually, you know, getting\npassed off onto the other ones here and\n\n1118\n00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:03,750\nthen it actually kicks it back in too.\n\n1119\n00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,180\nSo load balancers can work\nin many different ways.\n\n1120\n00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:10,030\nBy far, the type of load balancer\nI don't wanna say by far,\n\n1121\n00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:12,130\nthe biggest company that's out there,\n\n1122\n00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:15,680\nthat you tend to see especially in those\nenvironments which they expect a lot of,\n\n1123\n00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,740\nof, of traffic Is gonna be one called F5,\nand when you see these things,\n\n1124\n00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,820\nthey have this nice big red dot on\nthe front, just like their logo here.\n\n1125\n00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:27,410\nAnd here it is, it says local traffic\nmanager, and that's what they do.\n\n1126\n00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:31,830\nThey, they absolutely do load\nbalancing to the finest, and\n\n1127\n00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:35,890\nyou don't hear anybody ever saying hey,\nthese things are, are not great.\n\n1128\n00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:39,090\nF5 load balancers are,\nare by far the ones that you,\n\n1129\n00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,230\nyou hear more about than any other place.\n\n1130\n00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:42,360\nNow, are there other ones out there?\n\n1131\n00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,160\nYou better believe it.\n\n1132\n00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,160\nKemp Security here or, yeah, Kemp\nTechnologies, now I don't know where, but\n\n1133\n00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,580\nsomewhere along the line they put\nnumber one load balancer, you know,\n\n1134\n00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:55,380\non their own website so,\nI'm assuming that means that, you know,\n\n1135\n00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,840\nthat they found that somewhere that\nsaid that they're the number one.\n\n1136\n00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:01,310\nSo, so there, there are different\ndevices that are really out there and\n\n1137\n00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:04,440\nof course,\nBarracuda has their own as well.\n\n1138\n00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,150\nBut usually the ones that I have\nseen are actually the F5 ones\n\n1139\n00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:10,230\nthat you tend to see of any place.\n\n1140\n00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:11,500\nThese are the ones that,\n\n1141\n00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,500\nthat really just kind of sit in\nthe rack just like another device.\n\n1142\n00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,420\nBut it really does.\n\n1143\n00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,810\nIt can help divide that load up and\n\n1144\n00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:21,210\nit becomes a security appliance just\nby the nature of how it does it.\n\n1145\n00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:22,230\nThat's neat!\n\n1146\n00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:26,240\n>> So load balancing maybe not one of\nthe first things that comes into mind\n\n1147\n00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,510\nwhen we're talking about\nsecuring our network but\n\n1148\n00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:32,690\na nice side benefit of balancing that\nload is a little bit of security.\n\n1149\n00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:35,760\nBecause now they're going to have to\nlaunch an attack that could take down\n\n1150\n00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,800\nmultiple servers, how ever many nodes\nI have behind that load balancer.\n\n1151\n00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,360\nAll right,\nwell good information there, you know,\n\n1152\n00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:45,180\nwe solved how we can implement\nrouters to help with our security,\n\n1153\n00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:48,320\nwe got switches in there,\nwe talked about load balancers.\n\n1154\n00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,340\nWe're about out of time for\nthis segment, so why don't we stop here.\n\n1155\n00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:54,620\nWhen we come back, we're gonna take a look\nat some more technology we can use to\n\n1156\n00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:58,190\nsecure our networks like proxies and\nthings like that.\n\n1157\n00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:03,030\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n1158\n00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:08,637\n[SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n1159\n00:55:08,637 --> 00:55:11,480\nContinuing on with our\nnetwork device security.\n\n1160\n00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:15,410\nWe are gonna move on into\nthe world of proxies.\n\n1161\n00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:19,520\nSo proxy devices are next and, and\nRonnie explain to me what a proxy does and\n\n1162\n00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,680\nhow that's gonna help\nkeep my network secure.\n\n1163\n00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:27,020\nThe easiest way to think about a proxy at\nleast at the beginning when I was first\n\n1164\n00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:29,810\nlearning about it,\nlike I don't see why this really helps.\n\n1165\n00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:31,990\nI always thought about it like,\nwhen you go into a restaurant and\n\n1166\n00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:35,150\nyou order from a waiter,\nthe waiter takes your order, goes back and\n\n1167\n00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:37,580\nthe guy cooks it, and\nhe brings you the food.\n\n1168\n00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,980\nProxy serves really do the same thing for\nus.\n\n1169\n00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:42,786\nIt doesn't allow me to go directly\nback in the kitchen and tell the cook,\n\n1170\n00:55:42,786 --> 00:55:45,143\nthis is what you're gonna make me and\nthe hands me the stuff.\n\n1171\n00:55:45,143 --> 00:55:49,200\nThere is someone in between,\nan intermediary that we have in between us\n\n1172\n00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,931\nthat takes our order, and then of course,\nhopefully says it right to the cook, and\n\n1173\n00:55:53,931 --> 00:55:57,377\nthe cook delivers a perfect meal\nthat I love to eat, and, and\n\n1174\n00:55:57,377 --> 00:55:59,912\nI'm glad to actually have on my, my plate.\n\n1175\n00:55:59,912 --> 00:56:04,539\nIn networking, we also use proxies\na lot of times to help us to put\n\n1176\n00:56:04,539 --> 00:56:09,530\nanother layer of separation in\nbetween us and an unsecured network.\n\n1177\n00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:14,360\nAnd the way that we do that, is by sending\nall of the requests that I would have for\n\n1178\n00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:18,000\nthe proxy server and the proxy server,\ninstead, goes out and retrieves it for me.\n\n1179\n00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,810\nLet me show you a diagram of\nwhat I am talking about here.\n\n1180\n00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:24,520\nSo, when we take a look, I did not\nactually cable it up exactly, I wanted you\n\n1181\n00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,356\nto see the, the beginning here,\nthat over here on work stations one and\n\n1182\n00:56:28,356 --> 00:56:33,465\ntwo on the left-hand side, If I were\nto try and make a web request to, well\n\n1183\n00:56:33,465 --> 00:56:38,660\ncomptia.org since we're actually taking\na look at Comptia's stuff well it doesn't\n\n1184\n00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:43,860\nautomatically allow web server one to go\nin and directly connect to comptia.org.\n\n1185\n00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:47,790\nBut instead I send that request\nto this proxy in the middle.\n\n1186\n00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:51,970\nAnd the proxy server instead says all\nright thank you, I will take that request\n\n1187\n00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:56,860\nand I will go ahead and\nretrieve that web page and store it here.\n\n1188\n00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:00,570\nAnd then return it back to\nworkstation number one.\n\n1189\n00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:04,870\nNow you might say, well,\nwhy does that actually help anything?\n\n1190\n00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:06,720\nThat sounds like you actually\nput something in between it,\n\n1191\n00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,080\nlike, makes it sound like it went slower.\n\n1192\n00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:14,200\nWell it goes slow for that very first one,\nbut the advantage here though,\n\n1193\n00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:19,100\nis when work station number two\ngoes to comptia.org as well.\n\n1194\n00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:22,290\nWell, when it does it, it hits the proxy\nserver, and the proxy server says oh,\n\n1195\n00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:23,920\nyou need to go to comptia.org.\n\n1196\n00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,430\nLook at that.\n\n1197\n00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:28,490\nI still have the web page for it, and\nlet me go ahead and return it back to you.\n\n1198\n00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:29,790\nSo usually, that first time,\n\n1199\n00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:32,550\nyou're actually making the connection\nall the way out through the internet.\n\n1200\n00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:34,550\nBut anybody else, at that point.\n\n1201\n00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:38,610\nis really only connecting\ninternally to their own network,\n\n1202\n00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:41,890\nunless something changes and\nthey have to make a request again.\n\n1203\n00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:43,370\nIt really does help.\n\n1204\n00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:47,490\nIt provides for us the ability then\nto take this proxy server, and\n\n1205\n00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:49,700\nat that point I can turn on reporting.\n\n1206\n00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,690\nI can see what types of traffic\nare actually going through that device.\n\n1207\n00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:56,360\nAnd there's traffic on there that\nI don't want to get through,\n\n1208\n00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,005\nI can go to that proxy and say, nope.\n\n1209\n00:57:58,005 --> 00:57:58,720\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1210\n00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,840\n>> Don't let that traffic go through,\nand actually stop it right there.\n\n1211\n00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:07,340\nSo in that sense, it does work\nlike a very basic firewall, but\n\n1212\n00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:09,280\nwe actually have some other\nthings we can do with it.\n\n1213\n00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,270\nAnd that advantage I\nwas telling you about.\n\n1214\n00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:13,420\nIs, is one of the key ones here.\n\n1215\n00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:19,190\nSo, Mike, we actually had this situation\nhappen, even in our company years ago.\n\n1216\n00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:20,440\nWhere when we were working at,\n\n1217\n00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,510\nat, at, at another building\nwhere we were actually located.\n\n1218\n00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:26,440\nThere was one day where we had some,\ngroup come in and\n\n1219\n00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,340\nthey all tried to download the exact\nsame application at one time.\n\n1220\n00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:32,950\nIt was like a, a 50 or 60 megabyte file.\n\n1221\n00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:35,150\nAnd there were like 48 people in there.\n\n1222\n00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:40,290\nWell we only had a T1 connection at 1.544\nmega, and so the presenter up front said,\n\n1223\n00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:44,520\nhey let's all go to our website, and\nlet's click here, and click download.\n\n1224\n00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:48,266\nAnd all of the sudden,\n48 individual separate requests.\n\n1225\n00:58:48,266 --> 00:58:52,110\nGet that T1 line to go out to\nthat web server out there, and\n\n1226\n00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:56,870\nthey all connected at a whopping fast\nspeed of something like 2.47 kilo-bits.\n\n1227\n00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:58,060\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> I mean, whatever it was.\n\n1228\n00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:00,370\nIt w, it was insanely fast.\n\n1229\n00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,360\nAnd you could tell that they weren't\nvery happy that the download took\n\n1230\n00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,380\nlike 20 minutes for\nthem to actually get through.\n\n1231\n00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,990\nBut they were all having to\ngo through that, that signal.\n\n1232\n00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:10,440\nSo here,\nI kinda drew the very same things.\n\n1233\n00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,520\nSo here's that 1.544 megabit connection\n\n1234\n00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,700\nlet me see if I can get\nthat out of the way.\n\n1235\n00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,670\nAnd then over here internally right,\n\n1236\n00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:21,600\nall of my devices at that point were\nreally running at 100 megabits.\n\n1237\n00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,530\nSo, when we did that right.\n\n1238\n00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:25,900\nAll 40 of those people were\ncramming through that and\n\n1239\n00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,410\nit really did slow down that,\nthe traffic so\n\n1240\n00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:32,520\nmuch so, that it wasn't really\na great experience for anybody.\n\n1241\n00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,600\nThe one thing that we actually\ntalked about and what we could do\n\n1242\n00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:40,200\nto alleviate that is that we said,\nhey let's implement a proxy server.\n\n1243\n00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,640\nAnd what will happen with a proxy\nserver is exactly what I told you.\n\n1244\n00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,990\nSo we implemented a proxy server.\n\n1245\n00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:51,450\nAnd now everybody pointed to this proxy\nserver instead, as it's default gateway.\n\n1246\n00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:54,910\nAnd then, it actually did all the proxying\nfor us out onto the internet.\n\n1247\n00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,230\nNext time when we had an event like this,\nand they all hit it, right?\n\n1248\n00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:02,100\nIt's really the very first\nperson that hits it, and\n\n1249\n01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,440\nit downloads back down to the proxy.\n\n1250\n01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,970\nThe other 47 are hitting the proxy, and\n\n1251\n01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:11,910\nthey're downloading it super fast\nbecause they are now on what?\n\n1252\n01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:16,950\nA 100 megabit network, and because we\nwanna switch, every single one of those\n\n1253\n01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:22,000\ncomputers was actually accessing that\ncached website at a 100 megabits, and\n\n1254\n01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,450\nthey thought it was\nthe fastest network ever.\n\n1255\n01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:27,430\nThey did not believe we\nonly had a T1 connection.\n\n1256\n01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:31,330\nNow, to the internet, because of how\nfast it actually ended up going, so\n\n1257\n01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:34,890\nit was amazing about how well that this\nhandled, and you might be wondering, like,\n\n1258\n01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:36,330\nwell, who the heck implements proxies?\n\n1259\n01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:38,915\nA lot of times, you see them implemented\nin schools more than anything, right?\n\n1260\n01:00:38,915 --> 01:00:40,670\n>> Mm-hm\n>> It gives them the ability to control\n\n1261\n01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,740\nthat traffic to know who's going out.\n\n1262\n01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:46,290\nWe can also do content filtering\non this proxy server as well.\n\n1263\n01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:50,220\nAnd so, so there's a lot of different\nbenefits to having something like this,\n\n1264\n01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:53,150\nbut if your traffic really doesn't\nrequire something like that,\n\n1265\n01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,570\nyou may just see it as just another\ndevice that you can put on there.\n\n1266\n01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:59,160\nBut if you need the additional security,\nproxy servers are another way to do that.\n\n1267\n01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,030\n>> Yeah, it's definitely something\nthat we want to think about,\n\n1268\n01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:02,930\nwhether we want to implement it or\nnot, because you notice it,\n\n1269\n01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:04,830\nit does become like a choke point.\n\n1270\n01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:09,120\nAll my internet traffic at this point is\ngonna be going through that proxy server.\n\n1271\n01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,780\nThe proxy server goes out and\ndoes the request.\n\n1272\n01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:15,920\nBut it gives us, as you said, that, that\nlayer of security that we can implement.\n\n1273\n01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:16,910\nThe nice, benefit,\n\n1274\n01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:18,820\nthe caching benefit's great, cuz I know,\n>> Okay.\n\n1275\n01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:20,205\n>> I remember that situation, Ronnie.\n\n1276\n01:01:20,205 --> 01:01:21,780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And, and when we set up that room for\n\n1277\n01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:23,390\nthis, this company to come in.\n\n1278\n01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:26,820\nWhen we set it up, all we did was download\nthat program before they even got there.\n\n1279\n01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:28,560\nAnd then whenever,\nwhen all the students walked in,\n\n1280\n01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,400\nthey go to download it,\nit's already been cached.\n\n1281\n01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,830\nAnd if you think about it,\n\n1282\n01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:36,000\nI mean, in your work place, a lot of your\nusers are going to the same resources.\n\n1283\n01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,450\nVisiting the same websites and\nthings like that.\n\n1284\n01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:40,160\nSo, it's cashing that content and\n\n1285\n01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,930\nthen the request doesn't have to go\nall the way out to the internet.\n\n1286\n01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:46,620\nIt can just pull that straight from the\nproxy and as you said the biggest place I\n\n1287\n01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:51,470\nsee them implemented is anywhere that\nthey need control over what their end\n\n1288\n01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:53,440\nusers are viewing from the internet\n>> Right.\n\n1289\n01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:58,030\n>> So schools, libraries, hospitals,\ngovernment you know, I know the VA they\n\n1290\n01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:03,430\nhave got some they run the big time\nproxies because another part of that proxy\n\n1291\n01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:07,850\nis the ability to to do some inspection\nof that content that's coming back.\n\n1292\n01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:12,970\nSo I can prevent my seventh graders from\nlooking up certain things on the internet\n\n1293\n01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:16,540\nthat might not be appropriate for\nviewing in that school situation or\n\n1294\n01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:17,770\nthat school environment.\n\n1295\n01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:19,910\nSo we get a few things there.\n\n1296\n01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:23,770\nIt's also giving us another\nside benefit of that proxy.\n\n1297\n01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:26,200\nIs typically they're also a net device.\n\n1298\n01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:26,940\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n1299\n01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:30,880\nBecause it's going out and requesting, and\nremember proxy, I love your description\n\n1300\n01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,520\nwith the waiter, you know, is doing\nsomething on behalf of somebody else.\n\n1301\n01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,650\nThat is basically what a proxy means,\nright.\n\n1302\n01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:38,240\nSo the proxy server is going out and\n\n1303\n01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:42,060\nrequesting that webpage on my behalf,\nso I don't have to do it.\n\n1304\n01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:45,720\nSo my private IP address, and you have\nlearned about NAD and Network Plus, and\n\n1305\n01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,650\nif not, go back and watch that.\n\n1306\n01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:50,920\nIf taking my private IP address off,\nwhether, well,\n\n1307\n01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,170\nit doesn't really matter\nif it's private or not.\n\n1308\n01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:56,560\nBut it's removing my IP address, putting\nthe IP address as the proxy as the source,\n\n1309\n01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,720\nand then going out and\nrequesting the web page.\n\n1310\n01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:03,180\nSo that web server out there on the\ninternet, so it, it has no idea who I am.\n\n1311\n01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:05,660\nThe only person it's\ndealing with is the proxy.\n\n1312\n01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:09,600\nSo it does give us a little bit of,\nof, you know,\n\n1313\n01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:13,550\nobscurity I guess would be a good way\nto say it, from the outside world.\n\n1314\n01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:17,030\n>> Yeah, the obscurity as well as the\nability to control the content that comes\n\n1315\n01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:18,760\nacross that type of connection.\n\n1316\n01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:22,100\nIs really the key behind why\nit's a great security device,\n\n1317\n01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,480\nespecially in those situations.\n\n1318\n01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,970\nMost of the time,\nif your company really doesn't need it,\n\n1319\n01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:29,220\nthey probably aren't gonna implement it,\nbut if you do, and usually,\n\n1320\n01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:32,890\nin school systems, like you said, cuz that\nis something they definitely don't want,\n\n1321\n01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:36,100\nto allow every type of traffic to come\nthrough, and it's the easiest way for\n\n1322\n01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:40,410\nthem to monitor it, cuz these things can\nspit out such incredibly detailed reports.\n\n1323\n01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:41,940\nIt really is amazing.\n\n1324\n01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,180\n>> All right, so we go our proxies.\n\n1325\n01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:44,700\nWe see where they fit on our network.\n\n1326\n01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,960\nRemember, that's gonna become the proxy.\n\n1327\n01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,505\nAnd probably one thing\nwe need to mention too.\n\n1328\n01:03:48,505 --> 01:03:49,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The proxy really becomes\n\n1329\n01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:50,750\nthe default gateway.\n\n1330\n01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:51,260\n>> Right.\n\n1331\n01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:51,890\n>> For your nodes.\n\n1332\n01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:52,810\nSomething that you've gotta do.\n\n1333\n01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:55,990\nBecause if you give 'em a default gateway\non a router, their traffic's going through\n\n1334\n01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:58,403\nthe router and is never going\nthrough that proxy server, right?\n\n1335\n01:03:58,403 --> 01:04:02,651\nSo the proxy becomes their,\ntheir gateway to the outside world.\n\n1336\n01:04:02,651 --> 01:04:04,755\nThat forces all that traffic\nto go through there.\n\n1337\n01:04:04,755 --> 01:04:05,971\nIf you give 'em other routes.\n\n1338\n01:04:05,971 --> 01:04:07,691\nNow, they can bypass your proxy, right.\n\n1339\n01:04:07,691 --> 01:04:11,202\nAnd I would use that ability to\ncontrol what types of information\n\n1340\n01:04:11,202 --> 01:04:12,460\nare pulling back.\n\n1341\n01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:15,920\nSo, we got our proxies receiver,\nthose fit in our network.\n\n1342\n01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:20,440\nNext thing we wanna talk about is\nthese web serv, security gateways.\n\n1343\n01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,510\nWhat the heck is a web security gateway?\n\n1344\n01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:24,907\n>> A web security gateway is\nactually kind of neat and\n\n1345\n01:04:24,907 --> 01:04:28,405\nyou've probably used one whether or\nnot you actually believe you have.\n\n1346\n01:04:28,405 --> 01:04:32,805\n[LAUGH] If you've ever actually stayed in\na hotel and you've jumped on their Wi-Fi.\n\n1347\n01:04:32,805 --> 01:04:35,545\n>> If you've gone to McDonald's and,\nyou know, jumped on their wi-fi.\n\n1348\n01:04:35,545 --> 01:04:37,560\nYou're like Mike and you go to Starbucks.\n\n1349\n01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And buy an $8.00 cup of coffee and\n\n1350\n01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,355\njumped on their Wifi, you've probably\nused a web security gateway.\n\n1351\n01:04:42,355 --> 01:04:43,035\n>> It's good coffee.\n\n1352\n01:04:43,035 --> 01:04:43,855\n[LAUGH]\n>> I, oh yeah.\n\n1353\n01:04:43,855 --> 01:04:45,955\nYou know, I, I cringe every time.\n\n1354\n01:04:45,955 --> 01:04:47,187\nWhen I.\n>> I actually have to pay\n\n1355\n01:04:47,187 --> 01:04:48,547\nmore than $2.00 for a cup of coffee, Mike.\n\n1356\n01:04:48,547 --> 01:04:49,677\n>> I gotta have.\n>> I'm I'm just about dying.\n\n1357\n01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:51,927\n>> I, I've gotta have my frappa,\nmocha, choca, whatever.\n\n1358\n01:04:51,927 --> 01:04:52,497\n>> Whatever, yeah.\n\n1359\n01:04:52,497 --> 01:04:53,307\n>> You call those things.\n\n1360\n01:04:53,307 --> 01:04:54,480\n[LAUGH]\n>> And the tall one,\n\n1361\n01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,553\nwhich is really just that big, I mean,\nit's amazing w, when you start taking\n\n1362\n01:04:57,553 --> 01:05:00,870\na look at, at these different, aspects of\n>> Some of the weird things that I\n\n1363\n01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:02,080\ntangent off on but.\n\n1364\n01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:05,510\n>> So you're telling me that you're,\nmight be running a web security gateway.\n\n1365\n01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:07,710\n>> They probably are wearing, or\nrunning a web security gateway.\n\n1366\n01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:13,260\nIt is all about the idea here of\nbeing able to control access, right.\n\n1367\n01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:16,140\nMost of the time, they're implemented\nas an open access point that people\n\n1368\n01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:21,200\ncan log in to, but the advantage of\nthat type of web security gateway\n\n1369\n01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,270\n>> Is at the same time,\n\n1370\n01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:27,120\nI can implement, essentially,\nsecurity policies on that traffic as well.\n\n1371\n01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:31,410\nSo I may actually set it up as an open\naccess point to, you know, at Starbucks or\n\n1372\n01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:32,720\nStarbucks may set it up.\n\n1373\n01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,970\nBut then they can say, all right, here's\nthe type of traffic I want to control,\n\n1374\n01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:38,780\nhere's the stuff that I want to\nbe able to come back through and\n\n1375\n01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:42,450\nnormally we just check a box and we agree\nto whatever the service agreements are,\n\n1376\n01:05:42,450 --> 01:05:46,430\nwhatever it may be And then it let's\nus go through, it controls that access.\n\n1377\n01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:50,000\nAnd the, the neat thing about it,\nwhich is kinda also though,\n\n1378\n01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,765\nthe scary thing about it,\nis it logs all the traffic.\n\n1379\n01:05:52,765 --> 01:05:54,580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It knows exactly what devices\n\n1380\n01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:57,560\nare actually connecting to it,\nand it keeps a log of that stuff.\n\n1381\n01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:58,920\nAnd it can be then centrally managed.\n\n1382\n01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:02,110\nIn other words that stuff can then\njust send all that someplace else like\n\n1383\n01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:03,220\nthe NSA or.\n\n1384\n01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:04,360\n>> What?\n>> No, it wouldn't do that.\n\n1385\n01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,901\n[LAUGH] It can send it.\n\n1386\n01:06:05,901 --> 01:06:06,401\n>> You telling me they're.\n>> Yeah.\n\n1387\n01:06:06,401 --> 01:06:07,071\n>> They're logging my, [SOUND].\n\n1388\n01:06:07,071 --> 01:06:07,930\n>> They are.\n\n1389\n01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:08,812\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1390\n01:06:08,812 --> 01:06:10,540\n>> Yeah, no, it can't do that.\n\n1391\n01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:11,810\nBut yes.\n>> I'm in trouble now.\n\n1392\n01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:14,040\n>> The, these are, are the things\nthat it really helps out doing.\n\n1393\n01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:16,950\nSo if your company actually\ndoes offer free Wi-Fi,\n\n1394\n01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:20,480\nmore than likely they're going\nthrough some device like this.\n\n1395\n01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,080\nWhich is that web security gate.\n\n1396\n01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,841\n>> You really are seeing them everywhere,\nand like Ronnie said,\n\n1397\n01:06:24,841 --> 01:06:27,771\nyou've probably dealt with one and\nmight not realized what it is.\n\n1398\n01:06:27,771 --> 01:06:28,991\nBut they're everywhere now.\n\n1399\n01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:32,372\nWhen you go to these places that are\nproviding this free Wi-Fi, you ever been\n\n1400\n01:06:32,372 --> 01:06:33,865\nto a place that when you go, you\n>> You,\n\n1401\n01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:35,135\nyou connect to they're access point.\n\n1402\n01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:38,495\nIt shows it's open, so\nyou click on your phone or what have you.\n\n1403\n01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:40,775\nAnd you have to read their little EULA and\n\n1404\n01:06:40,775 --> 01:06:43,225\nyou have to click a button that says,\nI accept.\n\n1405\n01:06:43,225 --> 01:06:47,827\nAnd then a lot of times, and I lo, you\nnow see some advertisements rolling by.\n\n1406\n01:06:47,827 --> 01:06:49,307\nThat's that web security gateway.\n\n1407\n01:06:49,307 --> 01:06:52,957\nIt gives them a chance to implement their\npolicies, still have an open network,\n\n1408\n01:06:52,957 --> 01:06:55,057\nstill not require you to\nhave a passphrase and\n\n1409\n01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:58,227\nsomehow distribute this\npassphrase out to all the, the,\n\n1410\n01:06:58,227 --> 01:07:03,277\nthe, authorized users, and at the same\ntime provide that level of security.\n\n1411\n01:07:03,277 --> 01:07:05,932\nI know the first time I saw it, I thought\nit was the most clever thing ever.\n\n1412\n01:07:05,932 --> 01:07:07,517\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because here I am at this,\n\n1413\n01:07:07,517 --> 01:07:09,347\nthis restaurant, or\nthis, it was at a club.\n\n1414\n01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:11,720\nAnd I connect to their wifi.\n\n1415\n01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:12,340\nIt's free.\n\n1416\n01:07:12,340 --> 01:07:13,800\nIt's open.\nI'm, like, great.\n\n1417\n01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:18,020\nAnd then I see ads rolling by, and for\nthe restaurants right in the area of that,\n\n1418\n01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:19,540\nthat club that I was in.\n\n1419\n01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:20,550\nAnd I thought, wow, that's clever.\n\n1420\n01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:21,580\nAnd you couldn't go anywhere.\n\n1421\n01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:24,790\nYou could not get internet access\nuntil those ads scrolled by.\n\n1422\n01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:28,690\nBut that was an example of them\nusing that web server gateway.\n\n1423\n01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:31,095\nIt gives them a chance to advertise,\nthat's cool.\n\n1424\n01:07:31,095 --> 01:07:32,270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you know,\n\n1425\n01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:35,750\nthey could also flash their policy up and\nsay what was acceptable, what was not\n\n1426\n01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:41,150\nacceptable, and, and give me access to the\nnetwork and kinda do the CYA on their end.\n\n1427\n01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:42,430\n>> And a lot of times,\n\n1428\n01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:45,800\nyou'll also see where it implements,\nsome malware protection.\n\n1429\n01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:49,070\nAs well as some of the Skypeing and\n\n1430\n01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:53,040\nIM, it can control stuff that goes\nacross it so Mike can't sit there and\n\n1431\n01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,120\nactually just text bomb somebody\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1432\n01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,423\n>> Just because he wants to off of that.\n\n1433\n01:07:56,423 --> 01:07:58,200\nThey choose to do so.\n\n1434\n01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:02,435\nThese are things that these gateways do\nprovide because it does provide that,\n\n1435\n01:08:02,435 --> 01:08:06,820\nthat neat idea of open access, but\nalso being able to implement good\n\n1436\n01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:09,380\npolicy when we need them to have their\n>> And\n\n1437\n01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:11,225\nit usually provides basic protections.\n\n1438\n01:08:11,225 --> 01:08:12,980\nAnti-malware and stuff like that.\n\n1439\n01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:14,350\nWhen people are connecting through.\n\n1440\n01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:17,760\nThat way not everybody gets infected\nfrom that one access point.\n\n1441\n01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,560\nSo they are really enhanced, places here.\n\n1442\n01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,440\nNow by far, some of the most popular ones,\nlet me go ahead and\n\n1443\n01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,320\nshow you an example here.\n\n1444\n01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:27,570\nWebSense is probably the biggest\none that you see out there,\n\n1445\n01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:29,370\non the planet is using this.\n\n1446\n01:08:29,370 --> 01:08:31,270\nAnd they are just about everywhere.\n\n1447\n01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:34,390\n>> Companies that actually need\nsuper high security stuff.\n\n1448\n01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:38,650\nAnd as well as being able to do things\nlike send you back that password\n\n1449\n01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:41,580\nthat comes back or if it was just\nan open access point, they can do that.\n\n1450\n01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:44,610\nAnd here's another here\nfrom Trustwave as well.\n\n1451\n01:08:44,610 --> 01:08:47,040\nSo you name it, there's several\ncompanies out there that do this.\n\n1452\n01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,840\nSysco, of course, has their own.\n\n1453\n01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:51,740\nYou name it everybody wants to get in\non the market when there's potential\n\n1454\n01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:52,430\nmoney to be made.\n\n1455\n01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:53,130\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n1456\n01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:56,230\n>> So, so anybody that's producing\nhardware probably will get in on this\n\n1457\n01:08:56,230 --> 01:08:58,850\nsecurity device here.\n\n1458\n01:08:58,850 --> 01:08:59,920\nWhat we're actually seeing.\n\n1459\n01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,080\n>> Yeah so very, multipurpose device.\n\n1460\n01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,580\nGot a lot of sophistication, or\n\n1461\n01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:05,840\na lot of possibilities that\nwe can use that device for.\n\n1462\n01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:10,245\nThe next thing I think we wanna talk about\nthen we talk about these web security\n\n1463\n01:09:10,245 --> 01:09:11,240\ngateways.\n\n1464\n01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,620\nWhat about a VPN concentrator.\n\n1465\n01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:15,650\nYou guys are familiar with VPNs right?\n\n1466\n01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:18,030\nVPN being my virtual private network.\n\n1467\n01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:19,390\nThey're everywhere nowadays.\n\n1468\n01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:23,000\nIt's the most common way to,\nto access the corporate network from home.\n\n1469\n01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,060\nOr to connect a branch office with a\ncorporate office, or multiple branches or\n\n1470\n01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:28,020\nwhat have you.\n\n1471\n01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:31,040\nSo, what does a VPN concentrator?\n\n1472\n01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,700\n>> When we started using\njust regular VPN connexions,\n\n1473\n01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,470\nthe majority of times if I'm\ndoing it from my laptop.\n\n1474\n01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:37,890\nNormally there's a little\nclient on my laptop, and\n\n1475\n01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:40,270\nthen I connect in to\nthe device on the other side.\n\n1476\n01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:43,650\nWhich may also just be software that's\nactually having that connexion.\n\n1477\n01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:47,660\nThe VPN concentrator is\na hardware-based way\n\n1478\n01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:50,510\nof doing the same thing that\nwe're talking about doing.\n\n1479\n01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:53,130\nSo, I'm not just running a computer\nthat accepts a VPN connection.\n\n1480\n01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:56,440\nI'm actually running a device\nthat's designed to handle\n\n1481\n01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,890\nmultiple VPN connections at one time.\n\n1482\n01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:01,370\nAnd, handle them incredibly efficiently.\n\n1483\n01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:04,410\nSo if you actually are trying\nto implement some policy,\n\n1484\n01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:07,300\nif you have tons of different\nconnections going through.\n\n1485\n01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:11,180\nWell, you can actually have that sent in,\nto just a regular computer and\n\n1486\n01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:14,840\nit can probably do it through a routing\nremote access and you're ready to go.\n\n1487\n01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,560\nThe problem there, then,\nis that once you open that connection up,\n\n1488\n01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,160\nit has access fully to your network.\n\n1489\n01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:23,480\nWith that vpn concentrator, it gives you\nthe same ability as we talked about with\n\n1490\n01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,850\nthe web, security gateway a little bit.\n\n1491\n01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:27,450\nWe can implement some different policies.\n\n1492\n01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:30,230\nWe can control the way that\nit actually does connect.\n\n1493\n01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:31,430\nAnd normally when we do this,\n\n1494\n01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:35,910\nwe can also decide what type of\nVPN access we want people to have.\n\n1495\n01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:37,990\nThe, whether they're,\nit's going to be the SSL VPN,\n\n1496\n01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:42,490\nwhere they just use a web browser, or\nwhere they use a traditional IP set VPN.\n\n1497\n01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:44,230\nThese concentrators can\nseparate that out and\n\n1498\n01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:47,450\nactually say how many types\nof connections do we want.\n\n1499\n01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:50,760\nSometimes you are limited, like if you're\nactually working with a Sysco ASA,\n\n1500\n01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,660\nyou're limited to the licenses.\n\n1501\n01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:56,580\nUsually it starts off with ten, and\nthen you can go to 50 and then unlimited.\n\n1502\n01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:59,100\nAnd you name it, there's so\nmany different versions out there,\n\n1503\n01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:02,960\nit just costs more and more money,\nto do that and vpn concentrators,\n\n1504\n01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,800\nbecause they're, they're really\nnot at the forefront anymore.\n\n1505\n01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:10,390\nYou can actually go onto eBay and actually\nget a, i say a relatively cheap one.\n\n1506\n01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:13,360\nThree or four hundred dollars and\nthat should be fully ready for\n\n1507\n01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:17,950\nany VPNs you want to have, and\nhave it switched in the actual hardware.\n\n1508\n01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:18,740\n>> I'm pulling it up right now.\n\n1509\n01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:19,300\n>> Yea, there you go.\n\n1510\n01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:21,200\n>> You guys going to start\na bidding war with me?\n\n1511\n01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:21,700\n>> Oh no.\n\n1512\n01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:27,270\n>> So VPN concentrators then\nis just at the basic level.\n\n1513\n01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:30,040\nIt really gives me the horsepower\nto handle multiple connections,\n\n1514\n01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:34,490\ncuz it's a device dedicated to just\naccepting those VPN connections,\n\n1515\n01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:36,030\nrather than a multi purpose device.\n\n1516\n01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:37,290\nLike taking a Window Servers and\n\n1517\n01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:40,790\nrunning router remote access on it,\nwhich is a perfectly find solution.\n\n1518\n01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:43,770\nBut if we need that extra horse power for\nmultiple connections,\n\n1519\n01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:46,640\nmaybe you wanna step it\nup to a VPN concentrator.\n\n1520\n01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,926\nIt also has built in you know, ways as you\nwere saying, you can do IP sect, VPNs or\n\n1521\n01:11:50,926 --> 01:11:51,446\nSLVPNs.\n\n1522\n01:11:51,446 --> 01:11:54,108\nSo security wise, the VPN concentrator is,\n\n1523\n01:11:54,108 --> 01:11:58,872\none helping to prevent any type of denial\nof servers attack that might be launched\n\n1524\n01:11:58,872 --> 01:12:02,602\nagainst my routing mode access\nserver Cuz it's a lot beefier.\n\n1525\n01:12:02,602 --> 01:12:03,970\nIt can handle a lot more connections.\n\n1526\n01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:05,826\nIt'll take a lot more denial.\n\n1527\n01:12:05,826 --> 01:12:06,409\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1528\n01:12:06,409 --> 01:12:07,735\n>> To bring it out of service.\n\n1529\n01:12:07,735 --> 01:12:08,401\nRight?\n>> That's correct.\n\n1530\n01:12:08,401 --> 01:12:09,112\nYeah.\n\n1531\n01:12:09,112 --> 01:12:09,640\n>> Okay.\n\n1532\n01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,860\n>> And in, in all of this, right,\nwe're actually separating it out.\n\n1533\n01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,990\nSo when you see stuff like this,\n\n1534\n01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:17,740\nthe VPN concentrator, it really\ndoesn't offload things away from.\n\n1535\n01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:21,930\nIf you set up your PF sense box and\nyou want VPN to be able to come in but\n\n1536\n01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:26,200\nnot go through your firewall, you can set\nup a VPN concentrator parallel with your\n\n1537\n01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,920\nfirewall to, to say, here's where\nthe VPNs are actually coming in through.\n\n1538\n01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,570\nAnd that takes some of the load off\nof that, that firewall as well and\n\n1539\n01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:35,150\nit gives you the ability\nto be able to monitor,\n\n1540\n01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:37,790\nto be able to do all the stuff\nthat you would normally do without\n\n1541\n01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:41,250\nhaving to rely on the processing\npower of your firewall, especially if\n\n1542\n01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:42,530\nyou've got an old 386 running-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1543\n01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:43,554\n>> And ready to go through.\n\n1544\n01:12:43,554 --> 01:12:45,090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, so you name it.\n\n1545\n01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:48,317\nThere's, there's many different reasons\nfor it, but you are starting to see,\n\n1546\n01:12:48,317 --> 01:12:51,263\nsee some of these things, but with\nthe newer advanced types of firewalls,\n\n1547\n01:12:51,263 --> 01:12:54,170\nthey're starting to actually do\nthe same thing even on those devices.\n\n1548\n01:12:54,170 --> 01:12:56,500\nSo that you,\nyou have kind of passed those things off.\n\n1549\n01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:00,425\nAnd that's why you're seeing more and more\non them, more and more of them on eBay.\n\n1550\n01:13:00,425 --> 01:13:02,226\n>> Is cuz, yeah, licensing.\n\n1551\n01:13:02,226 --> 01:13:03,878\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> And the way that these devices are now\n\n1552\n01:13:03,878 --> 01:13:05,045\ntechnically, you know.\n\n1553\n01:13:05,045 --> 01:13:06,730\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> They're, they're more efficient and\n\n1554\n01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:09,210\nyou're starting to see how,\nthem get offloaded pretty quickly.\n\n1555\n01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:09,760\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n1556\n01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:11,510\nAll right, well, I tell you what, Ronnie.\n\n1557\n01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:13,977\nThis is probably a good point for\nus to take a break.\n\n1558\n01:13:13,977 --> 01:13:15,080\n>> [CROSSTALK]. Sounds good.\n>> And then we've got a couple more\n\n1559\n01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:16,080\nthings we wanna talk about.\n\n1560\n01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,960\nWe wanna look at protocol analyzers and\n\n1561\n01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,396\nthose unified threat managements-\n>> Right.\n\n1562\n01:13:21,396 --> 01:13:22,070\n>> And a couple other things.\n\n1563\n01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:24,985\nBut let us take a quick break, and\nwhen we come back, we'll hit those.\n\n1564\n01:13:24,985 --> 01:13:26,485\nSo, see you back here in a few.\n\n1565\n01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:31,444\n[MUSIC]\n\n1566\n01:13:31,444 --> 01:13:33,736\n[SOUND]\n>> All right.\n\n1567\n01:13:33,736 --> 01:13:35,230\nWelcome back, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n1568\n01:13:35,230 --> 01:13:39,120\nSo we left off talking about VPN\nconcentrators, some other devices.\n\n1569\n01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:43,410\nMoving on down our list of devices that\nwe can use to help secure our network,\n\n1570\n01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:46,650\nI think next on our list\nis protocol analyzers.\n\n1571\n01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:47,160\n>> They are, yeah.\nProtocol-\n\n1572\n01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,350\n>> It's not really a device though, is it?\n\n1573\n01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:52,943\n>> It's not necessarily a device, but\nI guess you could buy a device to.\n\n1574\n01:13:52,943 --> 01:13:53,830\n>> Yeah.\n>> That probably could be\n\n1575\n01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:54,431\na protocol analyzer.\n\n1576\n01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:56,060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It is a nice tool, though.\n\n1577\n01:13:56,060 --> 01:14:00,501\nIt's a nice software tool for us to be\nable to use to inspect traffic paths.\n\n1578\n01:14:00,501 --> 01:14:03,230\nYou see what is going across the wires.\n\n1579\n01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:04,860\nYou might wonder,\nwhy is that a security tool?\n\n1580\n01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:06,880\nI can just see what's going across wires.\n\n1581\n01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,355\nBecause you can actually then see if\nyou implemented security correctly.\n\n1582\n01:14:10,355 --> 01:14:10,900\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n1583\n01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:13,240\nso by using something like this,\nit's really gonna help.\n\n1584\n01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,280\nBy far, the most popular one that\nyou actually see out there in\n\n1585\n01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,142\nthe world today is one called Wireshark.\n\n1586\n01:14:18,142 --> 01:14:19,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It is by far the most popular.\n\n1587\n01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,530\nAnd this comes from an, an older program,\nactually has switched names.\n\n1588\n01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:24,755\nWe used to call it Ethereal.\n\n1589\n01:14:24,755 --> 01:14:26,270\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> At, at one point in time.\n\n1590\n01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:27,650\nBut it's not the only\none that's out there.\n\n1591\n01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:30,818\nMicrosoft actually has another one\ncalled Microsoft Network Monitor?\n\n1592\n01:14:30,818 --> 01:14:32,190\n>> Network Monitor.\n\n1593\n01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:32,991\n>> Yeah, Network Monitor 3.4.\n\n1594\n01:14:32,991 --> 01:14:34,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So there are different ones that\n\n1595\n01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,290\nare out, out there and available.\n\n1596\n01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:39,830\nBut what we wanted to show you is why\nin the world we might want to use a,\n\n1597\n01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:42,740\na network or a protocol analyzer.\n\n1598\n01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:45,650\nSo what I've done is I've\nset up two routers, right?\n\n1599\n01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:49,320\nAnd I actually have a connection\nin between both of them.\n\n1600\n01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:52,490\nBut what I believe that I have\ndone is I have set up SSH,\n\n1601\n01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:57,070\nin other words a secure connection\nbetween those two routers.\n\n1602\n01:14:57,070 --> 01:14:59,620\nFor me to be able to verify that,\nI can accept it,\n\n1603\n01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,539\nthat everything is actually\nworking the way that it is.\n\n1604\n01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:03,565\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Cuz I think I've set it up correctly,\n\n1605\n01:15:03,565 --> 01:15:08,405\nbut for me to verify it, I just need to\nturn on a protocol analyzer in between.\n\n1606\n01:15:08,405 --> 01:15:10,465\nSo what I've done is I've\ntaken those two routers and\n\n1607\n01:15:10,465 --> 01:15:14,625\nI've put my computer in between by hooking\na hub in through the middle of it.\n\n1608\n01:15:14,625 --> 01:15:17,345\nAnd then I've connected that\nthen onto the network and\n\n1609\n01:15:17,345 --> 01:15:19,615\nI've turned on my protocol analyzer.\n\n1610\n01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:22,789\nSo let me go ahead and show you want I'm\ntalking about right here, all right.\n\n1611\n01:15:22,789 --> 01:15:25,530\nAll right, so\nthe one that I'm using is Wireshark.\n\n1612\n01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:29,210\nAnd yes, you see because I'm actually\nrunning PPP in between those two routers\n\n1613\n01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:33,830\nand the encapsulation protocol, it is\nkeeping that, that encapsulation up, and\n\n1614\n01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:35,320\nwe're seeing the echo replies and\n\n1615\n01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:38,220\necho requests up is what\nwe're seeing in between that.\n\n1616\n01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:40,410\nSo traffic is flowing between them.\n\n1617\n01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:44,200\nIf I go ahead and ping the other side,\nand I come back over here,\n\n1618\n01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,970\nwhere is my little, oh,\nthere it is, the short pin table.\n\n1619\n01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:49,910\nYou can see that the ping\nis actually happening and\n\n1620\n01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:52,192\nthat everything is actually working and\nI'm going, okay.\n\n1621\n01:15:52,192 --> 01:15:53,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I'm, I'm happy with that.\n\n1622\n01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:58,260\nBut what I want to do is from\nrouter number two, the router that\n\n1623\n01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:03,026\nI'm on right now, is I want to\nconnect over to router number three.\n\n1624\n01:16:03,026 --> 01:16:04,693\nAnd so, I wanna try and do something.\n\n1625\n01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:07,930\nI'm just gonna do Telnet here,\ninto the other router.\n\n1626\n01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:11,515\nNow, of course on a regular production\nnetwork you would never, ever do this.\n\n1627\n01:16:11,515 --> 01:16:12,580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n1628\n01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:14,180\nsince this is a lab network, there it is.\n\n1629\n01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:19,990\nSo I've gone ahead and done this and I'm\ngonna type in my username and there it is.\n\n1630\n01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:23,810\nAnd then of course my super secret\npassword to get me access in,\n\n1631\n01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:26,830\nand that looks good so far.\n\n1632\n01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:29,400\nAnd I'm gonna actually type\nin my enable password.\n\n1633\n01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:33,330\nIn other words, to give me the ability\nto do some configuration on that device.\n\n1634\n01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:34,530\nI'm now done.\n\n1635\n01:16:34,530 --> 01:16:39,960\nNow, if i take a look at the protocol\nanalyzer itself, I can go ahead and\n\n1636\n01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:44,900\nsee the traffic here, especially\nbeginning with this Telnet data.\n\n1637\n01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,070\nSo there's the Telnet data.\n\n1638\n01:16:46,070 --> 01:16:50,021\nIf I right-click on that and\nI go down to follow TCP string,\n\n1639\n01:16:50,021 --> 01:16:52,318\nlook at what's turned up, Mike.\n\n1640\n01:16:52,318 --> 01:16:52,818\n>> Hm.\n\n1641\n01:16:52,818 --> 01:16:56,736\n>> Right here, right in front of us,\nwhat we actually see is that in the red is\n\n1642\n01:16:56,736 --> 01:16:59,347\nthe information that I\ntyped in from router two.\n\n1643\n01:16:59,347 --> 01:17:03,008\nIn the blue is actually the information\nI got from router three.\n\n1644\n01:17:03,008 --> 01:17:05,407\nAnd there it is,\nI can actually read it, Mike.\n\n1645\n01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:08,341\nLook, User Access Verification.\n\n1646\n01:17:08,341 --> 01:17:10,643\nUser name, oh my gosh,\nlook at what's happened here.\n\n1647\n01:17:10,643 --> 01:17:12,074\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now, when you start seeing stuff like\n\n1648\n01:17:12,074 --> 01:17:14,026\nthat, you're like,\nwhat in the world's going on?\n\n1649\n01:17:14,026 --> 01:17:16,870\nWell, it accepted my input and\nreturned it, too.\n\n1650\n01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:19,643\nSo that's why we're seeing the,\nthe dittography that we have.\n\n1651\n01:17:19,643 --> 01:17:20,299\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In other words,\n\n1652\n01:17:20,299 --> 01:17:21,693\nthe doubles that we have right there.\n\n1653\n01:17:21,693 --> 01:17:22,818\nAnd then, look at that.\n\n1654\n01:17:22,818 --> 01:17:26,065\nMy password came across plain text.\n\n1655\n01:17:26,065 --> 01:17:26,587\n>> Plain text.\n\n1656\n01:17:26,587 --> 01:17:27,630\nMm-hm.\n>> Just plain text.\n\n1657\n01:17:27,630 --> 01:17:29,818\nAnd so somewhere along the line,\n\n1658\n01:17:29,818 --> 01:17:33,656\nI apparently did not set up what\nI thought I had set up here.\n\n1659\n01:17:33,656 --> 01:17:34,425\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so\n\n1660\n01:17:34,425 --> 01:17:36,473\nI'm able to actually monitor that and\n\n1661\n01:17:36,473 --> 01:17:39,040\nbe able to see something\nlike that very easily.\n\n1662\n01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:44,810\nBut let me go ahead and\ndisconnect again, and\n\n1663\n01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:49,000\nlet's say that Mike tries it this time and\nhe actually implements SSH.\n\n1664\n01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,130\nSSH, and then I have to do a -l for\nthe log in, and\n\n1665\n01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:57,910\nI now type in Mike's name and of course\nthe IP address of the other side.\n\n1666\n01:17:57,910 --> 01:18:00,810\nHopefully that's an actual IP address,\nthere we go.\n\n1667\n01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:03,553\nOh, no, it actually isn't.\n\n1668\n01:18:03,553 --> 01:18:04,118\n>> 23.\n\n1669\n01:18:04,118 --> 01:18:06,260\n3, I think.\n\n1670\n01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:06,870\n>> Oh, 23 yep.\n\n1671\n01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:07,980\nSee, I can't even type.\n\n1672\n01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:08,480\nThere we go.\n\n1673\n01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:12,520\nAnd now I'm gonna enter in\nhis super secret password,\n\n1674\n01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:15,162\nwhich is not 1234, believe it or not.\n\n1675\n01:18:15,162 --> 01:18:16,490\n>> [LAUGH] 12345.\n\n1676\n01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:19,651\n>> That's right.\nOop, there we go.\n\n1677\n01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:26,610\nThat's here and now at this point, I'm\ngonna go ahead and do some configuration.\n\n1678\n01:18:26,610 --> 01:18:29,470\nI'm gonna go to an interface, oops, like.\n\n1679\n01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:33,898\nI don't know if that's\nactually an interface or not.\n\n1680\n01:18:33,898 --> 01:18:34,950\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1681\n01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:37,832\n>> And I'm gonna type my IP address.\n\n1682\n01:18:37,832 --> 01:18:38,629\nOh, maybe.\n\n1683\n01:18:38,629 --> 01:18:41,443\nEverything's slowing down for me.\n\n1684\n01:18:41,443 --> 01:18:44,401\nI think my machine's actually\ngetting overwhelmed.\n\n1685\n01:18:47,776 --> 01:18:48,671\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> It, it,\n\n1686\n01:18:48,671 --> 01:18:50,425\nit's coming up here, but\n>> Yeah.\n\n1687\n01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:52,947\n>> It's a,\nit's inside a little virtual lab.\n\n1688\n01:18:52,947 --> 01:18:54,725\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So that SSL, if it is kicking in,\n\n1689\n01:18:54,725 --> 01:18:56,275\nit's probably slowing\nit down just a wee bit.\n\n1690\n01:18:56,275 --> 01:18:57,125\n>> Yep.\n\n1691\n01:18:57,125 --> 01:19:01,245\nSo now, I went ahead and kind of deleted\nall that and now, I'm coming down here and\n\n1692\n01:19:01,245 --> 01:19:02,929\nI'm looking for the ones that say SSH.\n\n1693\n01:19:02,929 --> 01:19:05,877\nIf I right-click on that one and\n\n1694\n01:19:05,877 --> 01:19:10,002\nI go to follow the TCP stream,\nnow take a look at the difference here.\n\n1695\n01:19:10,002 --> 01:19:11,137\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1696\n01:19:11,137 --> 01:19:14,267\n>> Now instead, what I see is\neverything has been encrypted.\n\n1697\n01:19:14,267 --> 01:19:16,967\nWhen we talk about encryption,\nlook at all this stuff, Mike.\n\n1698\n01:19:16,967 --> 01:19:17,576\nI mean-\n>> Right.\n\n1699\n01:19:17,576 --> 01:19:20,687\n>> This, that's some stuff that's\nactually returning right up there.\n\n1700\n01:19:20,687 --> 01:19:21,817\nWe see the name of it.\n\n1701\n01:19:21,817 --> 01:19:23,250\nWe see all the other stuff.\n\n1702\n01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:25,010\nBut all the stuff that I've been typing\n\n1703\n01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:25,680\nin-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1704\n01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:27,360\n>> Has now been encrypted and\n\n1705\n01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:32,070\nso I know that you can't see the data\nin between my machine and that one.\n\n1706\n01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:35,810\nAnd that means, hey,\nI'm doing something right at this point.\n\n1707\n01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:39,005\nSo the protocol analyzer really\ncan help us to verify whether or\n\n1708\n01:19:39,005 --> 01:19:42,574\nnot the security that we think we've\nimplemented really is working.\n\n1709\n01:19:42,574 --> 01:19:43,817\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or am I just getting\n\n1710\n01:19:43,817 --> 01:19:46,580\nplain text passwords, you know, from Mike.\n\n1711\n01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:47,464\n>> Yeah.\nAnd, and that's the key to remember here.\n\n1712\n01:19:47,464 --> 01:19:51,189\nIn this context, we're looking at\nthese packet capture utilities or\n\n1713\n01:19:51,189 --> 01:19:55,543\nthese protocol analyzers not as a way to\nsteal data or, you know, get passwords or\n\n1714\n01:19:55,543 --> 01:19:56,570\nthings like that.\n\n1715\n01:19:56,570 --> 01:20:00,228\nI'm testing the security on my network so\nthat I'm able to verify Is it actually\n\n1716\n01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:03,466\nencrypting that traffic like I\nthought it was between those routers.\n\n1717\n01:20:03,466 --> 01:20:06,397\nThe only way to know for sure is to like,\ntake a look at the traffic, and\n\n1718\n01:20:06,397 --> 01:20:07,880\nsee if it's encrypted.\n\n1719\n01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:13,440\nIf you've set up firewall rules or router\naccess control lists that are not allowing\n\n1720\n01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,770\nport 21 to go through, how do I know?\n\n1721\n01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:16,740\nYou know, I can look and see.\n\n1722\n01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:21,290\nIf I, if I do a protocol analysis on my\nnetwork and I see port 20 or 21 traffic,\n\n1723\n01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:23,930\nyou know, I know something is\nwrong on my firewall rules.\n\n1724\n01:20:23,930 --> 01:20:25,560\nMaybe I've got them in the wrong order.\n\n1725\n01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,470\nMaybe I didn't implement\nthe rule like I thought I did.\n\n1726\n01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:30,730\nSo these protocol analyzers give me\nthe chance to look at what's going on\n\n1727\n01:20:30,730 --> 01:20:33,890\non my network and make sure it's\nwhat I want to be on the network.\n\n1728\n01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:35,400\nRight?\nWe're not really talking about looking\n\n1729\n01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,040\ninside the packets.\n\n1730\n01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,512\nI\"m looking at the protocols\nat this point,\n\n1731\n01:20:38,512 --> 01:20:39,723\nnow those tools can be used for that.\n\n1732\n01:20:39,723 --> 01:20:40,956\nBut in this context,\n\n1733\n01:20:40,956 --> 01:20:44,880\nhow do I use a protocol analyzer\nto keep my network secure?\n\n1734\n01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:46,480\nBy analyzing the traffic and\n\n1735\n01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,630\nmaking sure it's what I meant\nto allow on that network.\n\n1736\n01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,930\n>> You know,\nit is really one of the most useful tools.\n\n1737\n01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:55,398\nAnd it does take a little bit of\ntime to get used to seeing what,\n\n1738\n01:20:55,398 --> 01:20:57,270\nwhat's does actually out there.\n\n1739\n01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:00,570\nBut overall though,\nit's a good utility to at least have a,\n\n1740\n01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:02,240\na bit of understanding about.\n\n1741\n01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:04,940\nAnd if you believe that people are sending\ntheir password and you go, you know,\n\n1742\n01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:07,920\nit's suppose to encrypted, but\nI'm able to do something like this and\n\n1743\n01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,250\nable to pull the password\nright off the line.\n\n1744\n01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:12,758\nThen I know, yeah, I might actually\nneed to think about something else.\n\n1745\n01:21:12,758 --> 01:21:14,030\n[LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1746\n01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:14,880\nAbsolutely.\n\n1747\n01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:17,940\nSo we got our protocol analyzers that\nwe can use to analyze the traffic\n\n1748\n01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:19,390\ngoing on our network.\n\n1749\n01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:22,089\nAnother thing that we might use is\nsomething called a spam filter.\n\n1750\n01:21:22,089 --> 01:21:23,048\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n1751\n01:21:23,048 --> 01:21:25,141\nI think we're probably got a good idea.\n\n1752\n01:21:25,141 --> 01:21:27,190\n>> Yep.\n>> Of what we mean by a spam filter, but\n\n1753\n01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:28,770\nlet's dive into it a little bit there,\nRonnie.\n\n1754\n01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:32,438\n>> Yeah, the, the idea of spam is\nsomething that we universally hate,\n\n1755\n01:21:32,438 --> 01:21:33,080\nreally ride it.\n\n1756\n01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As much as we can.\n\n1757\n01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:35,700\nWe want to get rid of it,\n\n1758\n01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:38,690\nbecause it really does clog up\nemail systems a lot of times.\n\n1759\n01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:41,430\nNow, you may say, well,\nwhat about when I only send out ten?\n\n1760\n01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:43,080\nI'm not really spamming anybody.\n\n1761\n01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,465\nWell, it's the combined effect,\nright, of every other.\n\n1762\n01:21:45,465 --> 01:21:46,310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n1763\n01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:48,830\norganization that's also\nsending this out as well.\n\n1764\n01:21:48,830 --> 01:21:52,270\nAnd so there are security devices\nout there that, that then,\n\n1765\n01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:57,370\nare able to intercept your email and\nbe able to mark some of the spam,\n\n1766\n01:21:57,370 --> 01:22:01,610\nas you know, as being spam and then try\nto allow the other things to come in.\n\n1767\n01:22:01,610 --> 01:22:04,750\nAnd we typically call them spam\nfilters is what we call them.\n\n1768\n01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:08,480\nIt really does help to replace\nthe incoming EML server\n\n1769\n01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:10,230\nthat can really then separate that out.\n\n1770\n01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:12,660\nAnd you give it a believability rating,\nor,\n\n1771\n01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:14,570\nI don't, I think that's what they call it.\n\n1772\n01:22:14,570 --> 01:22:17,749\nBut you give it a rating on, on how\naggressive that they, you're actually\n\n1773\n01:22:17,749 --> 01:22:21,018\nsaying hey, this is what spam actually\nis and this is what it isn't.\n\n1774\n01:22:21,018 --> 01:22:24,770\nAnd hopefully everything actually is\ngoing to work the way you want it to.\n\n1775\n01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:27,140\nThe bad part about some\nof these spam filters,\n\n1776\n01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:29,360\nof course,\nis that they can be too aggressive.\n\n1777\n01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:33,460\nAnd they can end up keeping some of the\nemails that are actually supposed to be\n\n1778\n01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:34,740\nto you.\n\n1779\n01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:36,670\nIf you, if you don't realize it.\n\n1780\n01:22:36,670 --> 01:22:38,930\nNow on my system since I'm using Google,\n\n1781\n01:22:38,930 --> 01:22:40,890\nI get a lot that gets\ncaught in my spam filter.\n\n1782\n01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:42,330\nI'm very happy about it.\n\n1783\n01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:44,470\nSometimes, though,\nI will get a message or two.\n\n1784\n01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:48,486\nEspecially if somebody else is using\na Hotmail, or something like that and,\n\n1785\n01:22:48,486 --> 01:22:51,490\nand they're, they're sending me a message,\nand like, you haven't replied back.\n\n1786\n01:22:51,490 --> 01:22:52,900\nAnd I say well, I didn't look,\n\n1787\n01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:56,660\nand I checked my spam filter, and\nthat's where it ends up being.\n\n1788\n01:22:56,660 --> 01:23:01,370\nSo we try and relieve that as much as\npossible by, by move, removing that so\n\n1789\n01:23:01,370 --> 01:23:04,190\nthat way you get more\nproductivity on your end.\n\n1790\n01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:07,476\nSo a couple of different ones\nthat you may see out there.\n\n1791\n01:23:07,476 --> 01:23:11,350\nThe one that we actually use here is,\nis the one from Barracuda.\n\n1792\n01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:14,750\nNow we like our Barracuda Spam Firewall,\nwe love that thing.\n\n1793\n01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:17,340\n>> Right.\n>> It has worked tremendously well\n\n1794\n01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:21,205\nby comparison to the way that we\nused to get so much much more spam.\n\n1795\n01:23:21,205 --> 01:23:25,585\nBut every once in a while we do see things\nthat, that we expect to come through to us\n\n1796\n01:23:25,585 --> 01:23:29,665\nthat get caught in that, that spam filter\nand the nice thing about it is that\n\n1797\n01:23:29,665 --> 01:23:33,157\neverybody on our network can actually\nget access to a Web interface.\n\n1798\n01:23:33,157 --> 01:23:34,067\nCheck their own box and\n\n1799\n01:23:34,067 --> 01:23:37,397\ngo through their own spam just like\nyou would if you were using Gmail.\n\n1800\n01:23:37,397 --> 01:23:40,157\nAnd be able to actually trace that and\ngo, oh I need to actually make sure I\n\n1801\n01:23:40,157 --> 01:23:42,747\nwhite list that or\nI make sure that, that goes through.\n\n1802\n01:23:42,747 --> 01:23:44,067\nSo you do have some different management.\n\n1803\n01:23:44,067 --> 01:23:45,950\nA little bit complex at times.\n\n1804\n01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:49,052\nBut it is incredibly effective.\n\n1805\n01:23:49,052 --> 01:23:51,993\nThe only other way to do it is just\nget the spammers to stop doing this,\n\n1806\n01:23:51,993 --> 01:23:52,724\nthis job I mean.\n\n1807\n01:23:52,724 --> 01:23:53,355\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, good luck.\n\n1808\n01:23:53,355 --> 01:23:54,580\n>> And that's about the only way.\n\n1809\n01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:55,810\nYeah, there, yeah, and good luck.\n\n1810\n01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:58,740\nIt's, it's probably not gonna\nhappen anytime in the near future.\n\n1811\n01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:02,440\n>> Yeah, you know, I, I know, here we run,\nas you say, we run that Barracuda.\n\n1812\n01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:03,970\nAnd I can tell if that device is offline.\n\n1813\n01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:05,480\n>> Oh, yeah, [LAUGH].\n>> You know, I might get one or\n\n1814\n01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,830\ntwo spams here or\nthere that make it through in my inbox.\n\n1815\n01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:13,270\nIf that thing's down, all of a sudden,\nyou get this huge influx of spam.\n\n1816\n01:24:13,270 --> 01:24:14,320\nSo they're fantastic.\n\n1817\n01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:17,480\nAnd, and again, it's,\nit's a security thing because\n\n1818\n01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:20,860\na lot of times that spam could be trying\nto introduce some type of malware.\n\n1819\n01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:25,470\nSome spyware or some Trojan, or, or\nsome phishing scam or something like that.\n\n1820\n01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:28,600\nAnd if that makes it to my user's inbox,\nhopefully we've done our job,\n\n1821\n01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:31,390\nand we've educated our users on\nwhat they should click on and\n\n1822\n01:24:31,390 --> 01:24:33,760\nnot and things like that,\nbut it's not foolproof.\n\n1823\n01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,610\nOur users make mistakes.\n\n1824\n01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:36,510\nThings like that.\n\n1825\n01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:39,400\nThis can help me by not allowing\nthat to ever get to their inbox\n\n1826\n01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,260\nin the first place.\n\n1827\n01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:43,420\nSo there is no temptation to click\non it or anything like that.\n\n1828\n01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:45,560\nAnd as Ronnie says its a little\nbit of a learning curve for\n\n1829\n01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:49,520\nthat spam filter,\nwe've gotta kind of fine-tune it.\n\n1830\n01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,560\nYou guys here at IT Pro TV I\nknow have dealt with,\n\n1831\n01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:55,360\nsome of you have dealt with that, with\nsome of our responses after you signed up.\n\n1832\n01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,440\nAnd you get your code and your username.\n\n1833\n01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:00,940\nBecause of the generic type of the email\nthat's being sent back, you know,\n\n1834\n01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:05,550\nhere's your username, here's your whatever\nit is, sometimes spam filters get that.\n\n1835\n01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:07,003\n>> Yep.\n>> You know and so it's like, hey,\n\n1836\n01:25:07,003 --> 01:25:08,480\nI didn't get my email from IT Pro TV.\n\n1837\n01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,420\nHey, did you check your junk mail?\n\n1838\n01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:11,570\nYou know, cuz it could very well be there.\n\n1839\n01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:12,940\n>> Right.\n>> So they're, they're not foolproof.\n\n1840\n01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:18,230\nThey do catch stuff, that shouldn't be\ncaught, but typically we're okay with that\n\n1841\n01:25:18,230 --> 01:25:21,720\nbecause of all the stuff that they do get\nthat we didn't want to make it through.\n\n1842\n01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:24,600\n>> You know, it's, it's kind of\nthe weird thing in the world, right?\n\n1843\n01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:25,400\nWe need our email.\n\n1844\n01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:28,480\nWe need to make sure that it actually\nworks since it's the lifeblood of most,\n\n1845\n01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:33,780\nthe lifeblood of communication of\nevery organization that I know about.\n\n1846\n01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:36,570\nSo, we always wanna make sure\nthat that's up and available and\n\n1847\n01:25:36,570 --> 01:25:40,150\nthat people can access it, and\nwithout having to deal with a lot of\n\n1848\n01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:43,340\ngoing through and actually going okay,\nmy inbox got filled up with spam and\n\n1849\n01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:46,260\nI have to weed through and\nactually find out the actual real email.\n\n1850\n01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:49,310\nBy using these spam filters, it eliminates\nthe majority, they're not, I'm not gonna\n\n1851\n01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:52,080\ntell you it eliminates everything,\nbut it eliminates the majority.\n\n1852\n01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:55,450\nAnd it does it well and so\norganizations are willing to pay for\n\n1853\n01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:58,660\nthis device and, and\na lot of times you may even have to pay\n\n1854\n01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:01,950\nan annual fee to make sure that\neverything continues to be updated.\n\n1855\n01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:03,330\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n1856\n01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:06,700\nAll right, so we we've talked about our\nspam filters, our protocol analyzers.\n\n1857\n01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:11,360\nI think next on the list Ronnie is\na unified threat management system.\n\n1858\n01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:14,960\nWhat the heck is a UTM or\nunified threat management?\n\n1859\n01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:20,680\n>> The unified threat management is a\ncentralized way to be able to manage well,\n\n1860\n01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:23,950\njust about all the security\ndevices that we're talking about.\n\n1861\n01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:25,990\nAt the very beginning is\nall about trying to, to,\n\n1862\n01:26:25,990 --> 01:26:30,770\nto make sure that we had one console, one\ninterface, a universal interface where we\n\n1863\n01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:33,710\ncan control some of the stuff that\nwe've already been talking about.\n\n1864\n01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:38,260\nBut then as more and more hardware\nvendors started realizing things, well,\n\n1865\n01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:41,820\nlet's just turn this into a device\nthat we can sell that does\n\n1866\n01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:44,725\nall the features that we've been talking\nabout on these individual components.\n\n1867\n01:26:44,725 --> 01:26:47,200\nNow you may be wondering\nwhy would they do that.\n\n1868\n01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:50,860\nWell for management sake, right, if I'm\nthe one that's developing the hardware and\n\n1869\n01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:53,705\nthe software that is running on it and\nI develop the management interface,\n\n1870\n01:26:53,705 --> 01:26:57,260\nit's a lot easier for me to integrate\nall those and actually have it\n\n1871\n01:26:57,260 --> 01:27:01,370\nshine through one platform giving\nme a nice portal of management.\n\n1872\n01:27:01,370 --> 01:27:04,990\nBut if I'm using, a Cisco router and\nJuniper switch, and\n\n1873\n01:27:04,990 --> 01:27:09,610\nthen I choose to do a pfSense firewall,\nusually what that actually brings upon me\n\n1874\n01:27:09,610 --> 01:27:13,470\nas security professional is to be\nproficient in every single one of those,\n\n1875\n01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:16,340\nand not just to be able\nto manage the situation.\n\n1876\n01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:18,850\nNot, they'll go, I don't,\nI don't know what that command is, and\n\n1877\n01:27:18,850 --> 01:27:20,580\nI don't know how to actually\nget access to that.\n\n1878\n01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:23,240\nI have to learn something before I can get\naccess to that, and that's not necessarily\n\n1879\n01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:28,010\na bad thing but when companies need it,\nthis unified type of threat management\n\n1880\n01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:33,270\nsystem is something that we absolutely\ncan, can make sure that's in place.\n\n1881\n01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:35,950\nAnd then we can manage all of\nthe different security features\n\n1882\n01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:36,850\nthat are available.\n\n1883\n01:27:36,850 --> 01:27:38,958\nNow these systems are not cheap, Mike.\n\n1884\n01:27:38,958 --> 01:27:40,550\n>> Right.\n>> It' not like you're gonna go out and\n\n1885\n01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:43,360\ngo okay, I'll give $50 for\nthat and, and we are up and going.\n\n1886\n01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:46,611\nYet, normally, it's gonna be something\na bit more expensive than that.\n\n1887\n01:27:46,611 --> 01:27:50,396\nBut the neat thing, Mike, is, is I was\nlooking around this morning, I'm like, I'd\n\n1888\n01:27:50,396 --> 01:27:54,034\nlove to be able to show this cuz I think\nit's, it's a neat product, and most people\n\n1889\n01:27:54,034 --> 01:27:57,361\naren't actually gonna be able to do this\ncuz of how expensive these things are.\n\n1890\n01:27:57,361 --> 01:28:03,870\nBut there is a company out there let me\nmake sure I pull it up here, is Sophos.\n\n1891\n01:28:03,870 --> 01:28:05,940\nOr Sophos,\nhowever you want to pronounce it.\n\n1892\n01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:08,520\nAnd what they've done, and so\neverybody don't flood their, their,\n\n1893\n01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:09,597\ntheir network at one time,.\n\n1894\n01:28:09,597 --> 01:28:10,259\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1895\n01:28:10,259 --> 01:28:12,593\n>> They actually have a demo online,\n\n1896\n01:28:12,593 --> 01:28:18,070\nof their latest unified threat management\nnine system, and it really is a demo.\n\n1897\n01:28:18,070 --> 01:28:22,427\nIts got fake data in it, but it gives\nyou the, the actual interface here so\n\n1898\n01:28:22,427 --> 01:28:27,440\nthat that way we can take a look so I'm\njust gonna click on the login, oop, oh no!\n\n1899\n01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,097\nThe back end connection failed,\nit's reloading.\n\n1900\n01:28:29,097 --> 01:28:32,045\nSo, of course it probably timed out.\n\n1901\n01:28:32,045 --> 01:28:33,917\n>> It crashed out there.\n\n1902\n01:28:33,917 --> 01:28:36,537\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I had it pulled up a long time before\n\n1903\n01:28:36,537 --> 01:28:38,730\nthe episode this morning and\ngetting ready.\n\n1904\n01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:42,660\nBut it is something that you can go on\nthere to be able to take a look at.\n\n1905\n01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:44,670\nAnd let's see if I can now log in.\n\n1906\n01:28:44,670 --> 01:28:47,100\nAnd there it goes it's now logged me in.\n\n1907\n01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:50,460\nAnd it kind of gives you\na very nice realistic feeling.\n\n1908\n01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:54,600\nAnd here it is on the left hand side,\nI have the ultimate\n\n1909\n01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:58,410\ndashboard that gives me a summary\nof all of the different things.\n\n1910\n01:28:58,410 --> 01:29:02,220\nAnd here that Sophos you can see how many\ndevices you can plug in and everything.\n\n1911\n01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:05,650\nSo a great little graphical\nuser console there, and\n\n1912\n01:29:05,650 --> 01:29:09,230\nthen I just clicked onto another,\ntab for one reason or another.\n\n1913\n01:29:10,270 --> 01:29:14,250\nDemo model, you can see what model\nyou're running version information,\n\n1914\n01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:17,240\nthe advanced threat\nprotection you name it.\n\n1915\n01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:18,440\nAnd then you go from there, and go,\n\n1916\n01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:21,390\nwhat, what else can I do I can\nselect management and look at\n\n1917\n01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:25,510\nall of the different settings that I have\naccess to from my backups to licensing.\n\n1918\n01:29:25,510 --> 01:29:30,810\nFor my web administration,\ncentral management, interfaces and\n\n1919\n01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:34,170\nrouting if I want to be able\nto do it all in one interface.\n\n1920\n01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:36,260\nI'm not having to go to the Cisco router,\n\n1921\n01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:38,150\nI'm not having to go to\nthe switch to do it.\n\n1922\n01:29:38,150 --> 01:29:41,110\nIt's all right here\nunderneath this one system,\n\n1923\n01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:46,180\nto be able to pull up data,\nto be able to do IPv6 if I want to.\n\n1924\n01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:49,535\nStatic routing, you name it, and\nthen we have other ones here.\n\n1925\n01:29:49,535 --> 01:29:53,400\nE-mail protection,\nweb protection all in one interface,\n\n1926\n01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:55,920\nMike that is a cool, cool device.\n\n1927\n01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,350\n>> Okay if you just look at it,\nit's really all the different tospics,\n\n1928\n01:29:58,350 --> 01:30:02,000\ntopics that we've covered over\nthe previous segments on this episode,\n\n1929\n01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,610\nare now listed in this one column, so\n\n1930\n01:30:03,610 --> 01:30:06,920\nI can manage them from one interface\nwhich is a fantastic thing.\n\n1931\n01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:09,150\nAs an admin,\nit makes my life a whole lot easier.\n\n1932\n01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:12,310\nI've got one interface to learn,\none technology to learn, and\n\n1933\n01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:15,570\nI can manage all of these different things\nand they can kind of get, start getting\n\n1934\n01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:19,710\ntied together so we can see some that\nsecurity issues that might crossed\n\n1935\n01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:24,580\nboundaries between that proxy and that\nVPN concentrator, or something like that.\n\n1936\n01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:28,330\nNow there is a downside, to doing\nunified thread management, Ronnie.\n\n1937\n01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:29,030\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n>> Right?\n\n1938\n01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:31,590\n>> Yeah, there's always downsides\nto all these things, right?\n\n1939\n01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:35,541\nIt means you buy into their entire system,\nand so when, when you do that, right,\n\n1940\n01:30:35,541 --> 01:30:40,020\nyou can not actually be getting the best\nof everything that's also out there.\n\n1941\n01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:43,330\nAnd even having to learn the system\nis a little bit confusing unless you\n\n1942\n01:30:43,330 --> 01:30:45,150\nsit down and, and\nhave to learn everything.\n\n1943\n01:30:45,150 --> 01:30:47,790\nSo just kind of realize that there's\nalways upsides, and downsides, to doing\n\n1944\n01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:52,290\nthis, but a lot of times if you are having\nto manage them individually one at a time.\n\n1945\n01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:53,895\nThere's a lot more time consumption,.\n\n1946\n01:30:53,895 --> 01:30:55,630\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Here one device,\n\n1947\n01:30:55,630 --> 01:30:58,710\nmaking sure that everything is actually\nsituated the way that it needs to.\n\n1948\n01:30:58,710 --> 01:31:02,390\nGreat management interface, but\nit really isn't as fun I hate to say it.\n\n1949\n01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:03,080\n>> You know, and, and\n\n1950\n01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:05,740\nmy big concern with it is it\nbecomes a single point of failure.\n\n1951\n01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:06,950\n>> Right.\n>> For several things, you know,\n\n1952\n01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:10,310\nif there is where I'm doing\nmy spam filtering and, and\n\n1953\n01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:12,650\nall of my web application filtering and\nthings like that.\n\n1954\n01:31:12,650 --> 01:31:14,710\nIf I'm doing that all\nfrom this one interface,\n\n1955\n01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:16,250\nthat becomes a single point of failure.\n\n1956\n01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:20,920\nSo if they can DDOS, if they can denial\nof service my spam filter, you know, or\n\n1957\n01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:22,510\nmy firewall or something like that,\n\n1958\n01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:25,095\nthat could potentially now bring\ndown the rest of my protection.\n\n1959\n01:31:25,095 --> 01:31:25,720\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1960\n01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:30,030\n>> All of my layers, are kinda now in this\none thing and, and that becomes an issue.\n\n1961\n01:31:30,030 --> 01:31:33,480\nWhereas if they are separate devices on my\nnetwork, a separate, like you were saying,\n\n1962\n01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:36,480\nI've got my Cisco router,\nI got my, my Juniper switches,\n\n1963\n01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,470\nI've got my

01:31:49,628\nseveral other classes in our library.\n\n1968\n01:31:49,628 --> 01:31:52,446\nSecurity and convenience, it's a slider.\n\n1969\n01:31:52,446 --> 01:31:53,143\n>> [LAUGH] It is.\n\n1970\n01:31:53,143 --> 01:31:55,767\n>> All right.\nSo, as you move towards convenience,\n\n1971\n01:31:55,767 --> 01:32:00,610\nmanaging everything from one interface,\nyou're moving away from

thing, I am moving way from\nconvenience so, it's your call, you know,\n\n1975\n01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:10,050\nwhat do I need to do in\nthis particular scenario?\n\n1976\n01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:13,870\nDo I want go with a unified threat\nmanagement, simplify that management but\n\n1977\n01:32:13,870 --> 01:32:17,400\nput all of my eggs kind of in that one\nbasket, or do I want to keep the separate\n\n1978\n01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:21,010\ndevices and separate management, a little\nmore to work with, but maybe a little more\n\n1979\n01:32:21,010 --> 01:32:24,405\nsecure something, that you or your\norganization are gonna have to decide.\n\n1980\n01:32:24,405 --> 01:32:26,150\n>> Yeah so, Sophos and\n\n1981\n01:32:26,150 --> 01:32:30,025\nthen probably the one that a lot of people\nare also familiar with is the Sonic Wall.\n\n1982\n01:32:30,025 --> 01:32:31,420\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> From Dell.\n\n1983\n01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:33,770\nYou name it, they are coming out\nwith these devices every day, and\n\n1984\n01:32:33,770 --> 01:32:36,320\nyou can bet that Cisco has one too.\n\n1985\n01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:39,900\nSo there's many of these different\ntypes of systems that are out there.\n\n1986\n01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:43,290\nAnd even though this provides for that,\nthat one device that really does centrally\n\n1987\n01:32:43,290 --> 01:32:46,512\nmanage, they would of course love for\nyou to buy all those other devices.\n\n1988\n01:32:46,512 --> 01:32:47,461\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, that,\n\n1989\n01:32:47,461 --> 01:32:48,840\nexactly the same name

is,\nwell it works but\n\n1992\n01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:57,200\nlimited in other words, you're not gonna\nget the fancy interface that you see right\n\n1993\n01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:00,360\nhere if you actually have everything\nthat's from so faster to make it work.\n\n1994\n01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:04,845\nSo, so it's neat, there's no doubt a,\na neat management system.\n\n1995\n01:33:04,845 --> 01:33:07,000\nAnd great,\nespecially if you're a long distance away.\n\n1996\n01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,545\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But overall though, I,\n\n1997\n01:33:08,545 --> 01:33:09,400\nI don't think

looking at\nthe clock, we're about out of time.\n\n2002\n01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:22,847\nSo, we're gonna take a break.\n\n2003\n01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:26,795\nWhen we come back, we'll do IPS's and\nIDS's, so stayed tuned.\n\n2004\n01:33:26,795 --> 01:33:30,130\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n2005\n01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:35,526\nwelcome back, everyone.\n\n2006\n01:33:35,526 --> 01:33:38,520\nContinuing on with our\nnetwork security devices.\n\n2007\n01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:41,925\nGetting ready to talk about\ngood old IPS and IDS.\n\n2008\n01:33:41,925 --> 01:33:43,830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Bunch of acronyms we're gonna\n\n2009\n01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:44,360\nthrow out there.\n\n2010\n01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:45,330\nSo I guess the first thing, Ronnie,\n\n2011\n01:33:45,330 --> 01:33:47,790\nwe probably need to do is,\ndefine what acronym is, right?\n\n2012\n01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:50,610\n>> Right.\nWhen we take a look at the term IPS,\n\n2013\n01:33:50,610 --> 01:33:52,680\nit's Intrusion Prevention System.\n\n2014\n01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:56,790\nAnd the term IDS is\nIntrusion Detection System.\n\n2015\n01:33:56,790 --> 01:33:59,800\nNow, when we start to\ntake a look at them both,\n\n2016\n01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:03,740\nthey really function in just about\nthe same way, but they do it at,\n\n2017\n01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:08,930\nin, in different ways at, at the same time\nI know that that sounds, sounds strange.\n\n2018\n01:34:08,930 --> 01:34:12,320\nIn other words, the way that\nthey tend to detect intrusions\n\n2019\n01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:16,860\nalmost happens in the exact same way,\nbut the result of what they end up doing\n\n2020\n01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:20,810\nis not gonna be the same, and\nthat's why they're also different as well.\n\n2021\n01:34:20,810 --> 01:34:24,280\nSo a lot of times, when you start taking\na look at intrusion detection systems and\n\n2022\n01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:28,020\nintrusion prevention systems, it's easier\nto talk about them one at a time, so\n\n2023\n01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:29,340\nlet's go ahead and do that.\n\n2024\n01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:31,440\nI went ahead and made a simple diagram,\n\n2025\n01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:36,210\nthat I believe will help us to understand\nwhat we might actually be facing.\n\n2026\n01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:40,770\nBecause the devices are incredibly\nsimilar, a lot of times, it really depends\n\n2027\n01:34:40,770 --> 01:34:45,580\non where you tend to place them,\nthat makes the difference itself.\n\n2028\n01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:48,650\nSo, what I actually have, is over here on\nthe left hand side this is the diagram\n\n2029\n01:34:48,650 --> 01:34:50,480\nthat we've been using throughout the show.\n\n2030\n01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:54,300\nWe have our LAN and of course, a couple\nof web servers over here and then,\n\n2031\n01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:55,760\nthe edge of our network and of course,\n\n2032\n01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:59,190\nthe internet and possibly a branch\noffice over here on the right hand side.\n\n2033\n01:34:59,190 --> 01:35:03,150\nAnd now, I have a device that\nI've just labeled as IDS and IPS.\n\n2034\n01:35:03,150 --> 01:35:08,180\nWhen we start taking a look at introducing\nan intrusion prevention system,\n\n2035\n01:35:09,490 --> 01:35:15,120\nthe name itself actually describes\nwhat it does, intrusion prevention.\n\n2036\n01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:17,400\nSo, Mike, I think it's simple enough.\n\n2037\n01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:21,410\nIf I tell you, hey, I want you to prevent\nthis, usually what I'm saying is what?\n\n2038\n01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:22,734\nI want to stop before what?\n\n2039\n01:35:22,734 --> 01:35:23,270\n>> All right.\n\n2040\n01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:24,071\n>> Before something happens.\n\n2041\n01:35:24,071 --> 01:35:24,931\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yeah,\n\n2042\n01:35:24,931 --> 01:35:29,223\nso, with that in place them, what we\nnormally do is then we have a device now,\n\n2043\n01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:31,880\neverybody does this\na little bit differently.\n\n2044\n01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:36,970\nYou can buy separate devices to do this\nbut, Mike, if you end up with a Cisco ASA,\n\n2045\n01:35:36,970 --> 01:35:41,000\nyou normally add in an additional card,\nand that is really what puts into place.\n\n2046\n01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,134\nSo if you actually have a firewall,\nyou can add an additional,\n\n2047\n01:35:44,134 --> 01:35:48,098\nlike an expansion card, to your computer\nsystems you add that device in there,\n\n2048\n01:35:48,098 --> 01:35:52,563\nand that turns on that feature, and where\nthen we would normally place this device.\n\n2049\n01:35:52,563 --> 01:35:57,138\nLet me see if I can draw a line here this\nshould be a beautiful, line right there.\n\n2050\n01:35:57,138 --> 01:35:58,654\nOh, look at that nice.\n\n2051\n01:35:58,654 --> 01:36:03,282\nWe would actually place it right in\nbetween our network connection is\n\n2052\n01:36:03,282 --> 01:36:04,980\nwhat we would do.\n\n2053\n01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:07,150\nAnd that is normally where it would go.\n\n2054\n01:36:07,150 --> 01:36:13,130\nThe advantage of having this device in as\nan intrusion prevention system is now as,\n\n2055\n01:36:13,130 --> 01:36:15,150\nmaybe an attack happens.\n\n2056\n01:36:15,150 --> 01:36:19,910\nThat device is actually what will detect\nthe intru, or, detect the intrusion.\n\n2057\n01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:24,390\nBut then stop it right here at\nthat particular device, and\n\n2058\n01:36:24,390 --> 01:36:28,820\nnotice that the web server doesn't\nactually get any additional attack.\n\n2059\n01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:31,550\nIt doesn't actually have to worry\nabout doing load balancing,\n\n2060\n01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:35,330\nor have to worry about\ndenial of service attacks.\n\n2061\n01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:39,300\nThe intrusion prevention itself\nwill go ahead and do that for us.\n\n2062\n01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:41,050\nSo, it really stops the intrusion.\n\n2063\n01:36:41,050 --> 01:36:45,840\nAnd that's really what we want to\nhappen as, as often as we can.\n\n2064\n01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,015\nThis seems like the way to go.\n\n2065\n01:36:47,015 --> 01:36:48,180\n>> Right.\n>> If I were to actually put\n\n2066\n01:36:48,180 --> 01:36:50,120\nsome security device in place.\n\n2067\n01:36:50,120 --> 01:36:53,590\nSo Mike, if that's true, why in the world\nwould I even consider maybe an intrusion\n\n2068\n01:36:53,590 --> 01:36:55,185\ndetection system, if I can just stop it?\n\n2069\n01:36:55,185 --> 01:36:56,648\n>> Kind of, could be cost maybe?\n\n2070\n01:36:56,648 --> 01:36:57,330\n>> Yeah.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2071\n01:36:57,330 --> 01:36:59,840\n>> Lot of times it is actually\ndealing with cost, but,\n\n2072\n01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,500\nremember that with security, right?\n\n2073\n01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:04,840\nAnd you and I, are,\nare having to get used to this idea,\n\n2074\n01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:10,120\nthat security a lot of times, is not\nall about the, the fantastic world of\n\n2075\n01:37:10,120 --> 01:37:14,280\ndoing all of these little tools, and\nlearning how to, to secure devices.\n\n2076\n01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:18,020\nInside of a business, a lot of times it's\nmore about compliance than anything.\n\n2077\n01:37:18,020 --> 01:37:22,582\nAnd that means learning regulation, what\nyou like to call the bureaucratic stuff.\n\n2078\n01:37:22,582 --> 01:37:23,130\n>> Right, red tape.\n\n2079\n01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:26,160\n>> That we don't want to deal with,\nred tape, all that stuff.\n\n2080\n01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:28,890\nAnd that's what it comes\ndown to a lot of times, too.\n\n2081\n01:37:28,890 --> 01:37:33,260\nSo, every once in a while you may find\nout, depending on the industry that you\n\n2082\n01:37:33,260 --> 01:37:38,120\nend up working, with,\nthat what may happen instead, Is that this\n\n2083\n01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:43,140\ndevice has actually moved to actually\nbeing just another device on the network.\n\n2084\n01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:51,480\nAnd then, we go ahead and we connect\nthese devices together, like this.\n\n2085\n01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:55,900\nNow, when something like this ends up\nhappening, what we also end up seeing now\n\n2086\n01:37:55,900 --> 01:38:02,770\nis as an attack begins to happen,\nIt will go into the switch.\n\n2087\n01:38:02,770 --> 01:38:07,620\nBut it's here on this port right here,\nthe one that's going into the switch,\n\n2088\n01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:10,830\nthat we normally turn on something\nthat we call port mirroring.\n\n2089\n01:38:10,830 --> 01:38:15,560\nNow if you hear that term, port mirroring,\nnormally what they're expecting or, and\n\n2090\n01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:19,520\nit's actually e, equal to,\nis what we call intrusion detection.\n\n2091\n01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:24,610\nPort mirroring will allow for of the data\ngoing through that port to be mirrored\n\n2092\n01:38:24,610 --> 01:38:29,620\nto well either every port if we want it\nto, or to be mirrored to one other port.\n\n2093\n01:38:29,620 --> 01:38:30,630\nSo what I can do is way, hey,\n\n2094\n01:38:30,630 --> 01:38:36,010\nI want to mirror this port's\ntraffic to also send down here.\n\n2095\n01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:40,550\nAnd then allow that traffic\nto pass on through as well.\n\n2096\n01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:43,670\nNow when we do that, notice the problem.\n\n2097\n01:38:43,670 --> 01:38:46,920\nWe have the attack\nhappening right here and\n\n2098\n01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:51,260\nwe end up logging the attack\ndown here on this device too.\n\n2099\n01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:57,010\nSo in this sense, notice that\nthe intrusion doesn't get stopped.\n\n2100\n01:38:57,010 --> 01:39:00,810\nThe only thing that really happens\nis that we actually get a log.\n\n2101\n01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:02,350\nA lot of times an alert too.\n\n2102\n01:39:02,350 --> 01:39:03,280\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n2103\n01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,830\nSo you know, that's really, to me,\nthat's really the big difference.\n\n2104\n01:39:05,830 --> 01:39:09,030\nWhen you look at intrusion\ndetection systems, versus,\n\n2105\n01:39:09,030 --> 01:39:12,800\nversus intrusion prevention systems,\na detection system does just that.\n\n2106\n01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,920\nIt detects that attack,\nit can send off alerts,\n\n2107\n01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:17,000\nand let you know that\nthe attack is taking place.\n\n2108\n01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:18,330\nBut it can't do anything about it.\n\n2109\n01:39:18,330 --> 01:39:21,650\nWhereas an intrusion prevention system,\ncan take it a step further.\n\n2110\n01:39:21,650 --> 01:39:24,520\nThis is a, a level up on our devices,\n\n2111\n01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:27,890\nwhere it can detect the attack,\nit can also try to block the attack.\n\n2112\n01:39:27,890 --> 01:39:30,890\nIt can close down a port,\nshut down a switch,\n\n2113\n01:39:30,890 --> 01:39:34,120\na, a port on a switch that\na particular node is connected to.\n\n2114\n01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:37,290\nIf it detects that that node is\nbroadcasting out all kinds of nasty\n\n2115\n01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:39,270\nstuff or whatever, so it's like a step up.\n\n2116\n01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:41,010\nThis one can actually\ndo something about it.\n\n2117\n01:39:41,010 --> 01:39:44,500\nSo I think it's key to remember\nwhen we're defining these two is,\n\n2118\n01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:49,080\nintrusion detection systems can detect\nthe attack but can't do anything about it.\n\n2119\n01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:52,810\nIntrusion prevention systems can\ndetect the attack as well but\n\n2120\n01:39:52,810 --> 01:39:54,580\nthey can do something about it.\n\n2121\n01:39:54,580 --> 01:39:57,050\n>> And going back to what I was\nmaking a point about earlier,\n\n2122\n01:39:57,050 --> 01:39:59,040\nas far as the bureaucratic stuff.\n\n2123\n01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:02,560\nEvery once in a while you may actually\nfind that your company is told,\n\n2124\n01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:06,450\nlook, you need to implement\nan intrusion detection system.\n\n2125\n01:40:06,450 --> 01:40:08,660\nAnd, they don't mention anything\nabout the intrusion prevention.\n\n2126\n01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:10,930\nSo that means, you're going to actually\ndo this, and you may be wondering why.\n\n2127\n01:40:10,930 --> 01:40:14,120\nThe reason why is with that\nintrusion detection system,\n\n2128\n01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:17,480\nwe end up generating those logs,\nis what the key is.\n\n2129\n01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:18,850\nIf an attack is happening and\n\n2130\n01:40:18,850 --> 01:40:24,180\nwe are also supposed to later on be able\nto to know what time the attack happened.\n\n2131\n01:40:24,180 --> 01:40:25,930\nWhat type of attack happened.\n\n2132\n01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:28,150\nAnd what actually occurred on the device.\n\n2133\n01:40:28,150 --> 01:40:30,820\nThat intrusion detection\nsystem can take that time and\n\n2134\n01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:34,680\nlog all that information, and\nhave a nice, clean record of it.\n\n2135\n01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:36,430\nSo that later on, as you go back and\n\n2136\n01:40:36,430 --> 01:40:40,290\nthere may be future prosecution,\nthat you can also do this.\n\n2137\n01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:43,750\nNow there is another actual\npractical benefit to\n\n2138\n01:40:43,750 --> 01:40:45,970\nusing the intrusion detection as well.\n\n2139\n01:40:45,970 --> 01:40:49,030\nEarlier we talked a little bit\nabout using a load balancer to\n\n2140\n01:40:49,030 --> 01:40:51,250\nhelp us to divide the traffic up.\n\n2141\n01:40:51,250 --> 01:40:53,440\nSo that if one machine gets overloaded,\n\n2142\n01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:56,280\nwe can actually just start\ndistributing load between them.\n\n2143\n01:40:56,280 --> 01:41:00,760\nThe problem with the intrusion prevention\nsystem is, if it's actually right in\n\n2144\n01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:04,690\nbetween those devices, right, that's\nanother devices that the traffic has to\n\n2145\n01:41:04,690 --> 01:41:10,050\nslow down, get inspected, to say,\nthis is an attack or not.\n\n2146\n01:41:10,050 --> 01:41:13,260\nAnd make the decision that if\nit is an attack to stop it.\n\n2147\n01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:15,950\nIf it isn't an attack to let it\ngo along a forward on through,\n\n2148\n01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:19,970\nand it has to do that for\nevery single packet that comes through.\n\n2149\n01:41:19,970 --> 01:41:24,200\nBecause what it's doing, it's looking at\nthe actual application or the port, or\n\n2150\n01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:26,950\nthe protocol or whatever it is\nthat's actually doing that and\n\n2151\n01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:29,820\ntrying to figure out whether\nit's an attack or not.\n\n2152\n01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:32,150\nNow, when it has to do that, we slow down.\n\n2153\n01:41:32,150 --> 01:41:32,680\nRight?\n\n2154\n01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:36,860\nIt's a lot of times what you call a bump\nin the road, and that can really degrade\n\n2155\n01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:41,040\nperformance, especially if the people\nare expecting a lot of high speed.\n\n2156\n01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:43,000\nNetworks to be able to\ndo something like this.\n\n2157\n01:41:44,070 --> 01:41:46,310\nUsing that intrusion detection though,\n\n2158\n01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:48,780\nwhat happens is that we end\nup removing that device.\n\n2159\n01:41:48,780 --> 01:41:52,321\nThe only thing we're doing is we're\ncopying you know, we're making a copy of\n\n2160\n01:41:52,321 --> 01:41:55,727\nthat packet that's coming through and\nsending it to the intrusion detection.\n\n2161\n01:41:55,727 --> 01:41:59,810\nAnd then the other copy, or that same copy\nis actually going on to the end device.\n\n2162\n01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:01,960\nAnd then we get that log.\n\n2163\n01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:03,690\nAnd usually we also get an alert.\n\n2164\n01:42:03,690 --> 01:42:06,190\nBoth systems can actually alert you.\n\n2165\n01:42:06,190 --> 01:42:09,060\nBut the very fact is having\nthat log may actually be key,\n\n2166\n01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:11,270\nespecially if you work in one\nof those unusually regulated.\n\n2167\n01:42:11,270 --> 01:42:12,760\nI won't say unusually regulated.\n\n2168\n01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:14,741\nBut highly regulated industries.\n\n2169\n01:42:14,741 --> 01:42:16,587\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I should say is probably\n\n2170\n01:42:16,587 --> 01:42:19,286\nthe better term to think\nabout something like this.\n\n2171\n01:42:19,286 --> 01:42:22,500\nNow even in saying that, right, there's\na couple of other things we need to pay\n\n2172\n01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:25,670\nattention to which are really the,\nthe way that these things do it.\n\n2173\n01:42:25,670 --> 01:42:28,180\nSo let's go back to my\nslide here just briefly.\n\n2174\n01:42:28,180 --> 01:42:31,500\nAnd I wanna point out a few terms that\nI went ahead and just typed on here,\n\n2175\n01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:32,710\nto help us out.\n\n2176\n01:42:32,710 --> 01:42:36,110\nRegardless of whether we're talking\nabout intrusion prevention or\n\n2177\n01:42:36,110 --> 01:42:37,340\nintrusion detection.\n\n2178\n01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:38,048\nGood push off.\n\n2179\n01:42:38,048 --> 01:42:39,920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Regardless of whether we're\n\n2180\n01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,860\nactually talking about either one of them,\n\n2181\n01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:46,270\nthey all really work based on\nwhat I have up here at the top.\n\n2182\n01:42:46,270 --> 01:42:52,610\nSo some of them do what we call signature\nbased intrusion detection prevention.\n\n2183\n01:42:52,610 --> 01:42:56,560\nAnd that is the same way as things\nlike antivirus ends up working.\n\n2184\n01:42:56,560 --> 01:43:00,100\nSay here's what the bad code looks like,\nand then the intrusion prevention or\n\n2185\n01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:02,950\ndetection system matches that up and\nsays, you're bad code.\n\n2186\n01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:06,770\nThe intrusion prevention system\nsays all right let me block it.\n\n2187\n01:43:06,770 --> 01:43:08,580\nIntrusion detection says,\nyep, you're bad code.\n\n2188\n01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:10,809\nYeah, let's send it on through.\n\n2189\n01:43:10,809 --> 01:43:11,530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No big deal.\n\n2190\n01:43:11,530 --> 01:43:15,250\nSo it doesn't do anything except for\nlog you that that stuff is happening.\n\n2191\n01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:17,470\nSo that's one way it can do that.\n\n2192\n01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:20,340\nThose systems mean that your intrusions,\n\n2193\n01:43:20,340 --> 01:43:24,160\nthe type of system here,\nhas to go get regular updates.\n\n2194\n01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,370\nIt has to be able to bring that stuff in.\n\n2195\n01:43:26,370 --> 01:43:30,210\nAnd then it, it does that so you do have\nto monitor these things fairly closely.\n\n2196\n01:43:30,210 --> 01:43:33,524\nYou may even have to update,\nupdate several times during the day.\n\n2197\n01:43:33,524 --> 01:43:34,250\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> To make sure you get\n\n2198\n01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:36,120\nthe latest definitions in doing that.\n\n2199\n01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:40,530\nSo, it's not a device for\na network that's actually, fairly,\n\n2200\n01:43:40,530 --> 01:43:44,570\nyou know, one that you go man,\nI can't afford to keep going out and\n\n2201\n01:43:44,570 --> 01:43:49,004\nretrieving all of these, different,\nyou know, signatures throughout the day.\n\n2202\n01:43:49,004 --> 01:43:49,870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I couldn't remember,\n\n2203\n01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:52,125\nit's right in front of me and I still\ncan't remember, all these signatures.\n\n2204\n01:43:52,125 --> 01:43:56,656\nBecause it, it does, it's a lot of\nworkload that that device has to do.\n\n2205\n01:43:56,656 --> 01:43:58,512\nBut there's other ways to do it as well.\n\n2206\n01:43:58,512 --> 01:44:01,851\nNow, if you take a look at the other\none that I have listed here,\n\n2207\n01:44:01,851 --> 01:44:04,570\nthe behavior base,\nthis is a little bit stranger.\n\n2208\n01:44:04,570 --> 01:44:07,560\nIt doesn't really depend on\nthe signature of pointing,\n\n2209\n01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:10,540\nthat this stuff is actually bad.\n\n2210\n01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:12,890\nIn other words,\nhere's what bad code looks like.\n\n2211\n01:44:12,890 --> 01:44:17,210\nWhat it does is it says,\nhere's what good code looks like.\n\n2212\n01:44:17,210 --> 01:44:20,650\nAnd so, what you're gonna do is allow\nanything that looks like this good coding,\n\n2213\n01:44:20,650 --> 01:44:25,420\nin other words, what's good behavior,\nand pass that on through so\n\n2214\n01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:29,820\nthat way, anything else that actually\ndoesn't look like that gets filtered out.\n\n2215\n01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:30,990\nThen you have that anomaly base.\n\n2216\n01:44:30,990 --> 01:44:34,420\nThe anomaly base says,\nhere's what bad coding looks like.\n\n2217\n01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:38,010\nFilter that out instead and\nlet the good coding come through, so\n\n2218\n01:44:38,010 --> 01:44:42,330\neither way that you do it, you have those\ndifferent type of systems and all of them\n\n2219\n01:44:42,330 --> 01:44:45,750\nhave their advantages and disadvantages\nand sometimes you end up using them in\n\n2220\n01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:50,530\ncombination, and then there is the last\none here, which is the heuristic one.\n\n2221\n01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:51,560\nThe heuristic one is,\n\n2222\n01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:55,860\nis incredible in the very fact that\nit is a learning type of system.\n\n2223\n01:44:55,860 --> 01:44:59,740\nHeuristics come from the Greek word\nEureka, and so, it, it is the same thing.\n\n2224\n01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:00,930\nSo just like you heard everybody.\n\n2225\n01:45:00,930 --> 01:45:01,770\nIf you remember in third grade.\n\n2226\n01:45:01,770 --> 01:45:03,650\nWhen somebody said,\neveryone know what eureka stands for?\n\n2227\n01:45:03,650 --> 01:45:06,120\nNo.\nAnd the teacher goes, I found it.\n\n2228\n01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:09,620\nThat's exactly what happens is that it's\na learning type of system that says I can\n\n2229\n01:45:09,620 --> 01:45:11,750\nfind what's going on.\n\n2230\n01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:13,160\nThese systems end up.\n\n2231\n01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:16,340\nWhat they do is that they get enough\npackets that flow through them.\n\n2232\n01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:21,210\nAnd then they end up learning what\nthe normal behavior is on your network,\n\n2233\n01:45:21,210 --> 01:45:22,950\nunless abnormal behavior.\n\n2234\n01:45:22,950 --> 01:45:26,900\nAnd then they can differentiate\nbetween the two once they do that.\n\n2235\n01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:32,060\nThis is by far probably the most effective\nway of doing it, but the problem\n\n2236\n01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:35,640\nthat we have here it also takes the\nlongest time for it to learn your system.\n\n2237\n01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:38,680\nJust like us trying to learn how\nto ride a bike the first time.\n\n2238\n01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:40,310\nYou look at somebody and\ngo yeah, it's easy enough.\n\n2239\n01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:43,351\nYou get on a bike [SOUND] [LAUGH]\nyou fall over for a few times and\n\n2240\n01:45:43,351 --> 01:45:46,269\nthat's what ends up happening,\nand speaking of that,\n\n2241\n01:45:46,269 --> 01:45:50,766\nthat's why we also end up especially with\nthe heuristics, we have to pay attention.\n\n2242\n01:45:50,766 --> 01:45:53,161\nRegardless of the type\nof way that it works,\n\n2243\n01:45:53,161 --> 01:45:56,765\nwe end up with these four\ndifferent results that can happen.\n\n2244\n01:45:56,765 --> 01:45:57,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So Mike,\n\n2245\n01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:58,810\nlet's talk about some of these results.\n\n2246\n01:45:58,810 --> 01:46:00,770\nWhat in the world would\na false positive be?\n\n2247\n01:46:00,770 --> 01:46:02,750\n>> Yeah, when we talk about\nour intrusion protection and\n\n2248\n01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:05,970\nintrusion prevention systems, there's\nreally only four responses we can get.\n\n2249\n01:46:05,970 --> 01:46:06,960\n>> Right.\n>> We can get, a,\n\n2250\n01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:07,840\nas Ronnie has 'em listed here,\n\n2251\n01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:11,750\nfalse positive, false negative,\ntrue positive, true negative.\n\n2252\n01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:14,070\nWell positive being,\nwell if we just start with the,\n\n2253\n01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:18,290\nthe false positive, that's telling me that\nthere's a positive, there's an attack.\n\n2254\n01:46:18,290 --> 01:46:19,880\nSomething's going on.\n\n2255\n01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:20,555\nBut it's false.\n\n2256\n01:46:20,555 --> 01:46:21,290\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> All right.\n\n2257\n01:46:21,290 --> 01:46:22,470\nSo it thought there was something.\n\n2258\n01:46:22,470 --> 01:46:23,930\nSome type of attack taking place.\n\n2259\n01:46:23,930 --> 01:46:27,490\nIt gave me an alert, or tried to block\nit whatever type of system it is, but\n\n2260\n01:46:27,490 --> 01:46:28,330\nit was incorrect.\n\n2261\n01:46:28,330 --> 01:46:29,070\nIt was an attack.\n\n2262\n01:46:29,070 --> 01:46:31,580\nIt was something that I\nreally wanted to happen.\n\n2263\n01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:35,360\nFalse negative on the other hand\nis when it doesn't warn me.\n\n2264\n01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:36,630\nDoesn't log anything.\n\n2265\n01:46:36,630 --> 01:46:40,930\nDoesn't try to stop anything and\nthere was no attack.\n\n2266\n01:46:40,930 --> 01:46:41,430\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n2267\n01:46:41,430 --> 01:46:42,270\nSo we're okay with that,\n\n2268\n01:46:42,270 --> 01:46:42,970\nthat, we like that.\n\n2269\n01:46:44,050 --> 01:46:45,310\nA true positive, did I get that right?\n\n2270\n01:46:45,310 --> 01:46:46,550\n>> No, well,\nat the end on the false positive.\n\n2271\n01:46:46,550 --> 01:46:47,760\n>> I did that wrong actually.\n\n2272\n01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:48,370\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n2273\n01:46:48,370 --> 01:46:49,800\n>> Yeah.\nUsually with the false negative,\n\n2274\n01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:51,740\nwhat happens is that there\nreally is an attack.\n\n2275\n01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:53,860\nBut your system says,\nI don't see the attack.\n\n2276\n01:46:53,860 --> 01:46:54,360\n>> Exactly.\n\n2277\n01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:56,500\n>> So it's not really reporting it.\n\n2278\n01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:57,950\nSo even though it's there.\n\n2279\n01:46:57,950 --> 01:47:00,460\nIt just says, look,\nI don't see the attack and\n\n2280\n01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:03,220\nI'm telling you that there isn't\nan attack, when there really is one.\n\n2281\n01:47:03,220 --> 01:47:03,730\n>> Right.\n\n2282\n01:47:03,730 --> 01:47:04,390\nExactly.\nAnd then,\n\n2283\n01:47:04,390 --> 01:47:07,540\nyour true positive, you can alert,\nand there is an attack.\n\n2284\n01:47:07,540 --> 01:47:11,960\nA true negative, you've got an attack or\nyou get a report, but there is no attack.\n\n2285\n01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:12,500\n>> Yeah.\n\n2286\n01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:15,510\nYeah, with the true negative it's\nreporting exactly what is should be,\n\n2287\n01:47:15,510 --> 01:47:18,490\ntrue positive reporting exactly\nwhat it should be as well.\n\n2288\n01:47:18,490 --> 01:47:21,580\nAnd it's those two at the beginning\nthat we really worry about.\n\n2289\n01:47:21,580 --> 01:47:24,130\nWe expect some false-positives\nevery once in awhile.\n\n2290\n01:47:24,130 --> 01:47:26,115\nAnd, believe it or not,\nwe want that to happen.\n\n2291\n01:47:26,115 --> 01:47:27,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We'd rather be a little bit too\n\n2292\n01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:30,520\nsecure and go, all right,\nit's filtering out stuff I don't want.\n\n2293\n01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:32,760\nLet me figure out how to loosen that up.\n\n2294\n01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:36,310\nThe hardest one, and the one that we\nreally don't want to happen, is for\n\n2295\n01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:39,110\nmy system not to be able to recognize.\n\n2296\n01:47:39,110 --> 01:47:40,650\nWhen an attack is going on and\n\n2297\n01:47:40,650 --> 01:47:44,020\nso, when you have false positives, that's\nthe one, or false negatives, excuse me,\n\n2298\n01:47:44,020 --> 01:47:47,980\nthat's the one that we really worry\nabout more often than any of them.\n\n2299\n01:47:47,980 --> 01:47:52,020\nYou, you know, I always do this like with\nregular antivirus that I end up installing\n\n2300\n01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:52,835\non my own desktop.\n\n2301\n01:47:52,835 --> 01:47:53,670\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2302\n01:47:53,670 --> 01:47:56,770\n>> I hate to say it, I don't really\nknow if it's working or not because.\n\n2303\n01:47:56,770 --> 01:47:59,150\nIt never actually turns on, but\n\n2304\n01:47:59,150 --> 01:48:01,580\nthat's actually probably good because\nI don't need it to turn it on, but\n\n2305\n01:48:01,580 --> 01:48:06,510\nat the same time, and I really don't want\nthis so please nobody do this, I really\n\n2306\n01:48:06,510 --> 01:48:10,990\nwant to see if the actual antivirus will\nkick on when something like this happens.\n\n2307\n01:48:10,990 --> 01:48:12,040\n>> We'll see if you're right?.\n\n2308\n01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:13,310\n>> Yeah, I really don't want it.\n\n2309\n01:48:13,310 --> 01:48:15,690\nIt's one of those things where it's like\n>> Or\n\n2310\n01:48:15,690 --> 01:48:18,130\nam I actually just getting false,\nnegatives here?\n\n2311\n01:48:18,130 --> 01:48:20,060\nOr is it actually just doing its job?\n\n2312\n01:48:20,060 --> 01:48:24,120\nAnd I'm gonna assume on the safe side\nthat it's really just doing its job.\n\n2313\n01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:27,270\nBut we have to worry about these things\nand with the heuristics this takes\n\n2314\n01:48:27,270 --> 01:48:30,920\nthe longest time for\nit to weed through all those systems.\n\n2315\n01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:34,430\nThe other ones you will get more\nfalse positives and you know, then,\n\n2316\n01:48:34,430 --> 01:48:35,500\nthen anything else.\n\n2317\n01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:38,310\nBut you know usually the true positives,\n\n2318\n01:48:38,310 --> 01:48:40,660\ntrue negatives are by\nfar the most of them.\n\n2319\n01:48:40,660 --> 01:48:43,640\nI can't say every single one but\nit usually generates that.\n\n2320\n01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:45,720\n>> And like Ronny said,\nit is a time consuming thing.\n\n2321\n01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:49,040\nIt doesn't know it's good,\nit doesn't know it's bad.\n\n2322\n01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:52,420\nSo everything is going come back as\na positive, be it true or false.\n\n2323\n01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:56,200\nAnd it has to learn over time what is\nacceptable and what is not acceptable.\n\n2324\n01:48:56,200 --> 01:49:00,830\nBecause unlike the other systems, there is\nno database, there is no you know, a set\n\n2325\n01:49:00,830 --> 01:49:04,600\nof updates that we get that, that tell us\nwhat's good or bad, it has to learn it.\n\n2326\n01:49:04,600 --> 01:49:06,440\nAnd then we,\nwe have to be ones to teach it.\n\n2327\n01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:07,920\n>> Right.\n>> So there's a really good question in\n\n2328\n01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:08,550\nthe chat room there.\n\n2329\n01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:10,970\nJames is asking,\nif malware's on your system,\n\n2330\n01:49:10,970 --> 01:49:13,930\ncan heuristic analysis be fooled\ninto thinking it's legitimate?\n\n2331\n01:49:13,930 --> 01:49:15,370\n>> Yes.\n>> And absolutely.\n\n2332\n01:49:15,370 --> 01:49:21,160\nIf I see this suspicious activity and\nI, and it says, hey, what is this?\n\n2333\n01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:22,240\nIs this good or is this bad?\n\n2334\n01:49:22,240 --> 01:49:23,010\nAnd I say, oh that's good.\n\n2335\n01:49:23,010 --> 01:49:26,060\nAnd then it pops up again later and\nit says, hey, what is this?\n\n2336\n01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:28,250\nGood or bad?\nAnd I say, oh that's good.\n\n2337\n01:49:28,250 --> 01:49:30,160\nIt's going to learn that that behavior,\n\n2338\n01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:32,910\nthat is something that I\nexpect to see on my network.\n\n2339\n01:49:32,910 --> 01:49:35,260\nIt doesn't know what's good or bad.\n\n2340\n01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:36,670\nI'm teaching it what's good or bad.\n\n2341\n01:49:36,670 --> 01:49:37,470\n>> Right.\n>> So if I teach\n\n2342\n01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:40,200\nit that bad stuff is good,\nthen it's gonna go with it.\n\n2343\n01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:43,560\nIt, it's gonna trust me to, you know, cuz\nI'm the one that's training how to work.\n\n2344\n01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:46,080\n>> And, and\nI hate to say we do this because we\n\n2345\n01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:49,200\nbelieve a lot of times by\njust scanning those logs.\n\n2346\n01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:50,750\nAnd seeing where it's\nactually marked stuff, and\n\n2347\n01:49:50,750 --> 01:49:53,510\ngo, oh, yeah,\nthat should be allowed through.\n\n2348\n01:49:53,510 --> 01:49:56,200\nAnd we don't think anything about it,\nand we go ahead and click it as good.\n\n2349\n01:49:56,200 --> 01:49:59,660\nAnd then five minutes later said,\ndid I, did I mark that as good?\n\n2350\n01:49:59,660 --> 01:50:00,160\nOr did I-\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n2351\n01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:00,850\n>> Mark that as bad?\n\n2352\n01:50:00,850 --> 01:50:02,770\nAnd you just don't think about it.\n\n2353\n01:50:02,770 --> 01:50:04,780\nSo sometimes you do have to slow down.\n\n2354\n01:50:04,780 --> 01:50:07,410\nAnd Mike, more and more as,\nas I start working on systems,\n\n2355\n01:50:07,410 --> 01:50:08,850\nespecially having to troubleshoot them-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2356\n01:50:08,850 --> 01:50:13,300\n>> I am depending on logs more\noften than I ever have in my past.\n\n2357\n01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:16,050\nBecause I used to just think,\noh logs, who wants to read those,\n\n2358\n01:50:16,050 --> 01:50:19,180\nwho wants to pay attention to them,\nbut here especially when you're\n\n2359\n01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:22,110\nteaching that system, you've got\nto pay attention to these things.\n\n2360\n01:50:22,110 --> 01:50:24,620\nYou've got to actually spend\na little bit more time with them.\n\n2361\n01:50:24,620 --> 01:50:26,140\nIt is.\nIt's going to take a little bit of time\n\n2362\n01:50:26,140 --> 01:50:29,640\nuntil it evens out and figures out\nthe way that it actually need to run.\n\n2363\n01:50:29,640 --> 01:50:32,200\n>> This is where we can tie in one of\nthe things we talked about earlier,\n\n2364\n01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:35,380\nwe talked about packet sniffing or\nusing protocol analyzers.\n\n2365\n01:50:35,380 --> 01:50:36,100\nI get an alert.\n\n2366\n01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:38,700\nHey, something suspicious\nis going on over here.\n\n2367\n01:50:38,700 --> 01:50:42,750\nI can take my protocol analyzer, my packet\nsniffer, and I can look at that traffic.\n\n2368\n01:50:42,750 --> 01:50:46,070\nAnd that's how I can determine if this\nis something I want to have happen, or\n\n2369\n01:50:46,070 --> 01:50:47,580\nif it's something malicious.\n\n2370\n01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:50,780\nAnd then I can go back to my intrusion\ndetection, or prevention system.\n\n2371\n01:50:50,780 --> 01:50:52,070\nAnd let it know hey that was good.\n\n2372\n01:50:52,070 --> 01:50:53,980\nOr no that's somethin I don't\nwant to see on my network.\n\n2373\n01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:56,720\nSo we start combining these\ndifferent tools together\n\n2374\n01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:58,250\nto get a good security solution.\n\n2375\n01:50:58,250 --> 01:51:00,211\nAnd you know log files\nare the one thing Ryan that,\n\n2376\n01:51:00,211 --> 01:51:01,739\n[LAUGH] that most people ignore.\n\n2377\n01:51:01,739 --> 01:51:04,826\nAnd it's where your system is trying\nto tell you what's going on right.\n\n2378\n01:51:04,826 --> 01:51:05,660\n>> Right.\n\n2379\n01:51:05,660 --> 01:51:07,080\nFirst place we should vote really,\n\n2380\n01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:09,450\nits boring, its not the most\nexciting thing in the world.\n\n2381\n01:51:09,450 --> 01:51:12,940\nIts just lines and lines of log entries,\nbut you gotta do it.\n\n2382\n01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:16,400\n>> Its the most comprehensive way for\nyou to actually tell what your system is\n\n2383\n01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:20,990\nseeing, and its very easy just to think;\noh I couldn't be having that much stuff\n\n2384\n01:51:20,990 --> 01:51:26,070\ngoing on, but yeah there's a ton of stuff\ngoing on, and sometimes without examining\n\n2385\n01:51:26,070 --> 01:51:28,990\nthose things in the background\nthat really is reporting us...\n\n2386\n01:51:28,990 --> 01:51:30,950\nAre reporting to us what's happening.\n\n2387\n01:51:30,950 --> 01:51:33,110\nVery easy to make bad assumptions, and\n\n2388\n01:51:33,110 --> 01:51:35,840\nthat's not gonna be good\nespecially in terms of security.\n\n2389\n01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:39,034\nSo, all of the different devices that\nwe really looked at today, right?\n\n2390\n01:51:39,034 --> 01:51:42,300\nWe, we don't im,\nimplement them as single-point,\n\n2391\n01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:45,589\nin other words a one-stop shop solution,\nright?\n\n2392\n01:51:45,589 --> 01:51:49,228\nSo, usually we tend to use them in\ndifferent combinations; depending on\n\n2393\n01:51:49,228 --> 01:51:49,940\nwhat we need.\n\n2394\n01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:52,670\nBut just kind of realize that all\nthe devices that we talked about,\n\n2395\n01:51:52,670 --> 01:51:55,680\nyou're gonna see as a Network Plus\nprofessional at some level.\n\n2396\n01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:58,520\nSometimes it may be from behind a glass\nand you go, I wonder what that is.\n\n2397\n01:51:58,520 --> 01:52:01,490\nBut after a while, though,\nas you continue to work more and more and\n\n2398\n01:52:01,490 --> 01:52:04,720\nyou, you continue to, to develop more\nskill, you actually get access to these\n\n2399\n01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:07,890\ndevices so, so don't think like,\nman I'll never touch that.\n\n2400\n01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:09,930\nJust because you're not\ngonna touch it right away,\n\n2401\n01:52:09,930 --> 01:52:14,320\ndoesn't mean you don't have to have a,\na understanding of what that device does,\n\n2402\n01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:16,120\nand that's what they expect\nof you at Network Plus.\n\n2403\n01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:16,630\n>> Absolutely.\n\n2404\n01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:19,360\nYour network might not be implementing\nan intrusion detection system.\n\n2405\n01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:21,030\n>> Right.\n>> But as a Security Plus professional,\n\n2406\n01:52:21,030 --> 01:52:24,290\nyou get a job with this company,\nmaybe that's something you recommend.\n\n2407\n01:52:24,290 --> 01:52:26,186\nRight?\nBut, but knowing about this stuff is,\n\n2408\n01:52:26,186 --> 01:52:30,440\nis how I can go in there and make educated\nconsulting on them and, and let them know,\n\n2409\n01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:32,710\nyou know, what's the best solution for\ntheir network.\n\n2410\n01:52:32,710 --> 01:52:33,822\n>> Right?\n\n2411\n01:52:33,822 --> 01:52:37,161\n>> One last thing I want to throw in\nthere, and I don't think they call it out,\n\n2412\n01:52:37,161 --> 01:52:40,765\nRonnie, on the Security Plus exam, but\njust for your own FYI, when we talk about\n\n2413\n01:52:40,765 --> 01:52:44,846\nintrusion detection systems and intrusion\nprevention systems, another classification\n\n2414\n01:52:44,846 --> 01:52:47,920\nthat we can throw in there is\nthat host based or network based.\n\n2415\n01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:55,210\nSo you'll see things like H-I-D-S or\nHIDS or H-I-P-S or N-I-D-S or N-I-P-S.\n\n2416\n01:52:55,210 --> 01:52:58,710\nThese, these prevention and\ndetection systems can be network based.\n\n2417\n01:52:58,710 --> 01:53:00,470\nMeaning that they monitor\nthe entire network.\n\n2418\n01:53:00,470 --> 01:53:02,558\nLike Ronnie was showing you\nhow it was almost like a,\n\n2419\n01:53:02,558 --> 01:53:03,170\na choke point,\n>> Right.\n\n2420\n01:53:03,170 --> 01:53:05,960\n>> All that traffic was being funneled\nthrough that intrusion prevention system,\n\n2421\n01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:08,310\nso that it can do\nsomething about the attack.\n\n2422\n01:53:08,310 --> 01:53:12,280\nOr that network based intrusion detection\nsystem, was linked to the network itself,\n\n2423\n01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:16,020\njust like another node would, and we would\nport mirror stuff over to it, so it sees\n\n2424\n01:53:16,020 --> 01:53:20,390\nall the traffic going across the network\nand it can help my network remain safe.\n\n2425\n01:53:20,390 --> 01:53:23,540\nSo when we talk about network based,\nwhether it's intrusion detection or\n\n2426\n01:53:23,540 --> 01:53:27,980\nprevention, it's keeping that particular,\nusually on a subnet basis, different\n\n2427\n01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:30,070\nsubnets that have to have different,\n>> Policies.\n\n2428\n01:53:30,070 --> 01:53:31,690\n>> Connection points there.\n\n2429\n01:53:31,690 --> 01:53:36,710\nHost based, on the other hand,\nis on a single node or a single host.\n\n2430\n01:53:36,710 --> 01:53:38,880\nYou can have host-based\nintrusion detection.\n\n2431\n01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:41,150\nYou can have host-based\nintrusion prevention.\n\n2432\n01:53:41,150 --> 01:53:44,800\nBut the thing to keep in mind is\nthey're only protecting that one host.\n\n2433\n01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:47,050\nIf you look at the network\nadapter on that host,\n\n2434\n01:53:47,050 --> 01:53:48,620\nyou're staying inside the host, right?\n\n2435\n01:53:48,620 --> 01:53:50,345\nSo You might run both.\n\n2436\n01:53:50,345 --> 01:53:52,015\n>> Right.\n>> You might have a network intrusion\n\n2437\n01:53:52,015 --> 01:53:56,065\ndetection system going on in the network,\nand then on your sensitive machines\n\n2438\n01:53:56,065 --> 01:53:59,195\na host-based intrusion prevention\nsystem that could block the attack.\n\n2439\n01:53:59,195 --> 01:54:01,755\nSo, that way, you're not choking all\nthe traffic, you're detecting it, and,\n\n2440\n01:54:01,755 --> 01:54:04,885\non your sensitive systems, you block it,\nor some combination thereof.\n\n2441\n01:54:04,885 --> 01:54:07,880\nSo just something to keep in mind in\ncase they throw those terms at ya.\n\n2442\n01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:11,120\nHost-based intrusion detection and\nprevention systems.\n\n2443\n01:54:11,120 --> 01:54:13,726\nNetwork based intrusion detection and\nprevention systems.\n\n2444\n01:54:13,726 --> 01:54:15,860\n>> And it's kind of neat and\ninteresting that even through we,\n\n2445\n01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:19,190\nwe talk about the Windows Firewall\nas being just a host based firewall,\n\n2446\n01:54:19,190 --> 01:54:23,660\nin essence it's also a host based\nintrusion prevention system as well,\n\n2447\n01:54:23,660 --> 01:54:26,290\nbecause it really is, it's blocking\ntraffic that has gotten past our\n\n2448\n01:54:26,290 --> 01:54:30,540\nregular network firewall and then can\nblock it right there at the host itself.\n\n2449\n01:54:30,540 --> 01:54:34,120\nSo it plays a duel role in that,\nduel role in that way But\n\n2450\n01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:35,990\nanother system that is the same way.\n\n2451\n01:54:35,990 --> 01:54:37,620\nAnd, and I know, you're,\nyou're probably, like, oh,\n\n2452\n01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:40,560\nthat's not gonna be a system that's\nactually an intrusion detection system.\n\n2453\n01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:41,500\nBut it is.\n\n2454\n01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:44,100\nIf you've ever seen certain\ncomputers where you've opened\n\n2455\n01:54:44,100 --> 01:54:45,430\nup the side of the computer.\n\n2456\n01:54:45,430 --> 01:54:48,320\nAnd then you close the,\nthe the side of the computer back up.\n\n2457\n01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:49,400\nAnd you started it up.\n\n2458\n01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:51,645\nYou end up getting a little alert\nevery once in a while that tells you.\n\n2459\n01:54:51,645 --> 01:54:53,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Hey, somebody's actually\n\n2460\n01:54:53,020 --> 01:54:54,180\nopened this computer system.\n\n2461\n01:54:54,180 --> 01:54:58,960\nWell, even at the very base of that\nthat is an intrusion detection system\n\n2462\n01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:02,280\nthat's letting you know somebody's\nbeen in this computer and\n\n2463\n01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:04,480\nit might be something you need to inspect.\n\n2464\n01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:07,520\nYou see a lot more of this\noften especially on servers.\n\n2465\n01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:09,960\nBut we have like a I\nthink Optiplex is here.\n\n2466\n01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:12,470\n>> Yeah.\n>> Some 745s and some 960s\n\n2467\n01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:15,250\nthat will tell you when you actually open\nthat system, when you close it back up and\n\n2468\n01:55:15,250 --> 01:55:18,370\nyou start up, it actually just alerts\nyou that somebody's done that.\n\n2469\n01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:21,000\nAnd so, even at, at,\nat the simplest physical levels,\n\n2470\n01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:24,510\nwe can have these systems that go\nahead and log this thing down and\n\n2471\n01:55:24,510 --> 01:55:26,720\neven actually give you\na report right then.\n\n2472\n01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:29,000\nSo, that way you can go back and\nsee what time it happened.\n\n2473\n01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,130\nIf it happened you know\nlate in the evening,\n\n2474\n01:55:31,130 --> 01:55:32,962\nor did it happen during regular day.\n\n2475\n01:55:32,962 --> 01:55:36,310\nAnd it really does help to tie\nin all the systems together.\n\n2476\n01:55:36,310 --> 01:55:38,250\nLet you know what's happening,\nso it's pretty neat.\n\n2477\n01:55:38,250 --> 01:55:39,010\n>> Oh absolutely.\nAbsolutely.\n\n2478\n01:55:39,010 --> 01:55:43,120\nBecause I have seen some guys that will\ntake like, a phone of some kind and\n\n2479\n01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:44,860\nhave some nasty stuff loaded up on that.\n\n2480\n01:55:44,860 --> 01:55:47,750\nIf they can get into your case,\nthey can drop that phone in there,\n\n2481\n01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:49,460\nthey can plug it into\nan internal port in there.\n\n2482\n01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:49,960\n>> Right.\n\n2483\n01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:51,650\n>> And now I can try to access that or\n\n2484\n01:55:51,650 --> 01:55:54,430\nget information off that\nsystem anytime I want.\n\n2485\n01:55:54,430 --> 01:55:57,900\nRemember, physical security is a,\nis a huge part of security.\n\n2486\n01:55:57,900 --> 01:55:59,730\n>> Yeah.\n>> So it's a very good example of a,\n\n2487\n01:55:59,730 --> 01:56:01,040\nan intrusion detection system.\n\n2488\n01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:04,280\nIt's detected that somebody has\nintruded into this computer.\n\n2489\n01:56:05,310 --> 01:56:06,860\nMight or\nmight not have been authorized, right?\n\n2490\n01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:09,570\nWe have to figure that out, but\nat least I know what happened.\n\n2491\n01:56:09,570 --> 01:56:10,070\n>> Right.\n\n2492\n01:56:10,070 --> 01:56:11,000\nYeah.\n\n2493\n01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,500\nAll right Ronny, well we covered\na lot of really good information.\n\n2494\n01:56:13,500 --> 01:56:17,580\nAnything else we want to, to throw out\nat them for the net- Security devices.\n\n2495\n01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:19,470\nFor the security devices, remember.\n\n2496\n01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:20,380\nTake a look.\n\n2497\n01:56:20,380 --> 01:56:24,100\nMake sure you at least have the basic\nunderstanding of what the devices do.\n\n2498\n01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:27,030\nWe've talked a little about some of the\ndifferent configurations that we can do on\n\n2499\n01:56:27,030 --> 01:56:31,670\nsome of these devices, but we really did\nrefer to other episodes and shows that you\n\n2500\n01:56:31,670 --> 01:56:36,620\ncan go into and see how these devices\nare generally configured as well.\n\n2501\n01:56:36,620 --> 01:56:40,960\nRemember, don't take for granted\nthe very fact that these devices you may\n\n2502\n01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:43,100\nnever actually end up seeing again.\n\n2503\n01:56:43,100 --> 01:56:43,600\nYou will.\n\n2504\n01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:47,020\nIf you're working as a security\nprofessional, these devices are gonna be\n\n2505\n01:56:47,020 --> 01:56:49,750\naround you even if you don't know\nwhat every single one of them is.\n\n2506\n01:56:49,750 --> 01:56:52,480\nAfter a while,\nyou will learn about these devices and\n\n2507\n01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:55,560\nyou'll be expected at least know\nthe modicum of what they can do.\n\n2508\n01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:58,630\nAnd where they're normally\nimplemented which is also a key.\n\n2509\n01:56:58,630 --> 01:57:00,770\nSo you can't put that\npast them on the exam.\n\n2510\n01:57:00,770 --> 01:57:03,960\nBut they may just say where would you\nnormally implement something like this\n\n2511\n01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:04,660\non your network.\n\n2512\n01:57:04,660 --> 01:57:07,090\nAnd they may give you a diagram or\nthey may say hey\n\n2513\n01:57:07,090 --> 01:57:10,270\nhere's where you normally would find it\nat the edge of your network inside or\n\n2514\n01:57:10,270 --> 01:57:13,190\nwould you put this on the outside of\nyour router, inside, you name it.\n\n2515\n01:57:13,190 --> 01:57:16,690\nJust kinda make sure you pay attention\nto the placement of these things,\n\n2516\n01:57:16,690 --> 01:57:19,780\nas well as general configurations\nthat you can do on them too.\n\n2517\n01:57:19,780 --> 01:57:20,320\n>> Very good.\n\n2518\n01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:20,820\nVery good.\n\n2519\n01:57:20,820 --> 01:57:23,230\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's going to do it for this

Hello and\nwelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:39,400\nMy name is Mike Rodrick, and I'll be your\nhost today, and with me today is Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,810\nWes Bryan, how you doing, Wes?\n\n7\n00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,361\n>> I'm doing okay, thanks for\nhaving me back, man.\n\n8\n00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:44,560\n>> All right, absolutely man, looking\nforward to having you here all week.\n\n9\n00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,760\n>> Yes, man, we get to talk about\na lotta the cool geeky stuff.\n\n10\n00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,440\nTill Thursday cuz on Friday\nwe're going to Vegas.\n\n11\n00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,970\n>> We're going to Vegas.\n\n12\n00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,220\n>> All right, so anyway, if you guys\nare out in look for us out there.\n\n13\n00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,810\n>> Yeah, we'll be out there in the Vegas.\n\n14\n00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,640\n>> Now, welcome again guys, everybody.\n\n15\n00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,790\nWe're doing another episode\nin our security plus track.\n\n16\n00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:04,840\nRemember this is the new set of\nobjectives for the SYS 401 series.\n\n17\n00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,420\nAnd today we're gonna\nhitting objective 1.2.\n\n18\n00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,260\n>> That is, given a scenario, use secure\nnetwork administration principles.\n\n19\n00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,930\n>> Exactly, exactly, so we're gonna\ntalk about just ways that we can\n\n20\n00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,780\nfollow best practices, good security\nimplementation on the network.\n\n21\n00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,252\nAnd so far in a couple of these\nepisodes that we've done,\n\n22\n00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,410\nwe've talked about some of the different\ndevices and things like that.\n\n23\n00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,700\nAnd now we're gonna try to talk about\nhow are we gonna put this into place.\n\n24\n00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,295\nAnd not all of it, but a lot of it.\n\n25\n00:01:33,295 --> 00:01:35,670\nSo, again, it is a CompTIA.\n\n26\n00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,196\nSo, all right,\nthere's gonna be a lot of terminology,\n\n27\n00:01:38,196 --> 00:01:40,270\na lotta facts that we've gotta know.\n\n28\n00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,130\nBut then this also starts to throw\nin some of the implementation.\n\n29\n00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,140\nWhere we've got to know\nwhy are we doing this.\n\n30\n00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,780\nWhat are we gonna\naccomplish by doing this,\n\n31\n00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,790\nor what's the best way\nto go about doing this?\n\n32\n00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,470\nSo we'll try to keep it lively and\nexciting as we go through all these terms\n\n33\n00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,510\nand all these wonderful best practices,\nall right?\n\n34\n00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,980\n>> All right.\n\n35\n00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,910\n>> So, yeah,\nlet's just dive right into it.\n\n36\n00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,461\nYou guys ready?\n\n37\n00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:02,211\nReady to rock and\nroll out there in TV land?\n\n38\n00:02:02,211 --> 00:02:04,990\n>> Take a second here and say hey Paul,\nwelcome back, good to see you today bud.\n\n39\n00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,670\nGreat to have you here, man.\n\n40\n00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,378\n>> We got a whole crew.\n\n41\n00:02:06,378 --> 00:02:08,128\nJavier's back with us today.\n\n42\n00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,003\nHe was here yesterday.\n\n43\n00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,921\nPaul Martin's back today.\n\n44\n00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:11,670\n>> Yeah,\nwe got a pretty full chat room there.\n\n45\n00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,181\nMartin's back very cool.\n>> And\n\n46\n00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:14,170\na bunch of you guys that\nwere here with us yesterday.\n\n47\n00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:14,879\nGlad you guys are back.\n\n48\n00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,490\n>> Welcome guys.\n\n49\n00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,826\n>> All right, so again, yeah,\n\n50\n00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:20,823\nwe'll start talking about network\nadministration principles,\n\n51\n00:02:20,823 --> 00:02:25,162\nsome different concepts, like one is what\nwe call rule-based management, right?\n\n52\n00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:30,185\nAnd, rule-based management is we talk\nabout different management approaches.\n\n53\n00:02:30,185 --> 00:02:32,520\nRule-based is when we,\n\n54\n00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,205\nthere come to a definition as you can see\nup here, use of operational rules and\n\n55\n00:02:36,205 --> 00:02:40,730\nrestrictions to govern the security of an\norganization's infrastructure, all right?\n\n56\n00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,680\nSo this is, we can really apply to\na couple different ways, right?\n\n57\n00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,710\nAt the bigger sense,\nat the high up level, the CEO's,\n\n58\n00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,300\nthe C's and all those people they get\ntogether and they make these policies.\n\n59\n00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,800\nLike we want these computers to only\nbe used by company employees or\n\n60\n00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,630\nthese kind of policies.\n\n61\n00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,615\nThe email system shouldn't be used for\npersonal information,\n\n62\n00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,890\nkid's birthday invites and\nthings like that, right?\n\n63\n00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:05,400\n>> Sure.\n\n64\n00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,059\n>> And then so they create these rules and\nthese rules govern how we're protecting or\n\n65\n00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:14,128\nwhat we're allowed to do or\nnot allowed to do with out infrastructure.\n\n66\n00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:17,861\n>> Yeah, you essentially have\nthis predefined criteria,\n\n67\n00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:19,503\nwhatever the criteria.\n\n68\n00:03:19,503 --> 00:03:22,060\nWe're gonna move into,\none of the most common forms of\n\n69\n00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,461\nrule-based management is a firewall\nthat we'll talk about coming up.\n\n70\n00:03:25,461 --> 00:03:27,700\nBut you have a predefined set of criteria.\n\n71\n00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,370\nLike for instance, in Microsoft\nset Network Access Protection,\n\n72\n00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,270\nthey have things like health policies,\n\n73\n00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,390\nand if the rule says you have\nto have your firewall turned on.\n\n74\n00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,270\nIf you don't have your firewall turned on,\nwell, you don't get access to the network.\n\n75\n00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,670\nSo, essentially you can take that\nstep to predefined criteria,\n\n76\n00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,430\nthat rule that says if it meets the rule,\nwhat do we do now?\n\n77\n00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,930\nDo we allow it or do we deny it, and\na common thing that I can think of in our\n\n78\n00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,060\nback as they like to abbreviate\nit is firewall rules.\n\n79\n00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,850\nYou have predefined criteria that\nsays that if it's unsecure traffic,\n\n80\n00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,830\nokay well, we see unsecure traffic,\nwhat do we do with it?\n\n81\n00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,510\nDo we allow it?\n\n82\n00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,200\nDo we deny it?\n\n83\n00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,510\nDo we put other criteria with it?\n\n84\n00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,130\nDo we kick it off to\na remediation network?\n\n85\n00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,110\nBut yeah.\n\n86\n00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,630\n>> Exactly, and as Wes has\nstressed a couple of times here,\n\n87\n00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,070\nthat is really what it boils down to,\nis that these rules are predefined.\n\n88\n00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,960\nSomebody has got together, or\nmaybe one person, but usually\n\n89\n00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,480\na group of people has gotten together and\nsaid, this is the way it's going to be.\n\n90\n00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,719\nAnd there's no if's, and's, or\nbut's, this has to be followed.\n\n91\n00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,570\nWhich is a perfect segue into our\nnext one, which is firewall rules.\n\n92\n00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,385\nWhich Wes says, that's a very common, it\ndidn't have to be electronic, like I was\n\n93\n00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:36,795\nsaying it could be just a corporate\nsecurity policy, or things like that.\n\n94\n00:04:36,795 --> 00:04:40,477\nA great example with the network\naccess protection, and\n\n95\n00:04:40,477 --> 00:04:42,711\nthose rules that we define there.\n\n96\n00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:44,610\nAnd firewalls,\nthat's what it's all about, right?\n\n97\n00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,570\nWe're defining rules we do not wanna allow\n\n98\n00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:49,775\nFTP traffic to go to\nthis particular subnet.\n\n99\n00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:51,904\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, we write a rule on that root,\n\n100\n00:04:51,904 --> 00:04:56,022\non that firewall, that says anything\nthat's going to this network range on this\n\n101\n00:04:56,022 --> 00:04:58,130\nport number, we're gonna drop it.\n\n102\n00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,740\n>> Yes, Sir, yep, absolutely.\n\n103\n00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,130\nAnd when you look at some of\njust the basic firewall rule,\n\n104\n00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,010\na lotta times your default configuration\nin firewalls is that everything comes in.\n\n105\n00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,240\nIf I didn't ask for it,\nwe're just gonna discard that packet.\n\n106\n00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,620\nWe call it unsolicited traffic.\n\n107\n00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,260\nBut basically if you just take all the\ntechnical jargon down, it just means that\n\n108\n00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,150\nyou're not gonna send information into\nmy network that I didn't first request.\n\n109\n00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,120\nSo always remember that default\nconfiguration until you start modifying\n\n110\n00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,160\nthings is usually all\nyour outbound traffic.\n\n111\n00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,760\nSo your requests and stuff from\nWeb servers is gonna be allowed,\n\n112\n00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,480\nsending email, like you mentioned.\n\n113\n00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,490\nBut anything that comes in that if you\ndidn't first ask for, I always say,\n\n114\n00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,070\nask for it first, it's gonna be denied.\n\n115\n00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,350\nAnd that's really what we want.\n\n116\n00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,020\nWe don't want any of that traffic coming\ninto our network that we didn't first\n\n117\n00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,900\nrequest to be there.\n\n118\n00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,950\n>> Exactly, exactly, and most routers or\n\n119\n00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,620\nfirewalls are set up to where it\nblocks everything on the way in.\n\n120\n00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,010\nAnd it's up to you to decide what\nyou wanna allow to come through.\n\n121\n00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:53,549\nAlso keep in mind, as Wes said,\na lot of people will mistakenly\n\n122\n00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:57,830\nthink that if I click on a link\nin an email, here's the problem,\n\n123\n00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,370\nif I click on a link in an email, and it's\nmalware or something like that, I click\n\n124\n00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,890\nthat link, it went out to this site and\nit's now downloading this Trojan horse.\n\n125\n00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,920\nWhy is that being allowed to\ncome through my firewall?\n\n126\n00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,780\nAnd not a bad thing?\n\n127\n00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,600\nShouldn't something catch it?\n\n128\n00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,590\nIt's return traffic.\n\n129\n00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,000\nYou asked for it.\n>> You asked for it.\n\n130\n00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,550\n>> You know it's not unsolicited.\n\n131\n00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,440\nYou asked for it and it's gonna allow\nthat traffic to come back through.\n\n132\n00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,000\n>> And just like we have talked about in\nan earlier episode where we we're talking\n\n133\n00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,990\nabout those high-level port ranges,\nfirewalls keep track of that information.\n\n134\n00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,510\nThey know that it's coming back because as\nit went out, they were paying attention to\n\n135\n00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,000\nthat, and they were paying attention\nto those high-level port numbers.\n\n136\n00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,859\nAnd when it comes back in, they're gonna\nsee that high-level port number and say,\n\n137\n00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:38,110\nwell, the firewall's gonna say,\nwell wait a second here.\n\n138\n00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,420\nYou initiated this communication so we're\ngonna allow it right back to the firewall,\n\n139\n00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:47,220\nwhich is why viruses those attack\nplatforms, that's why they use them.\n\n140\n00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,430\nYou asked for it, well,\nunfortunately you got it.\n\n141\n00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,870\n>> The old, I think we mentioned the ten\nimmutable laws of security the other day.\n\n142\n00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,880\nAnother one of my favorites is, if I can\nget you to install a piece of software on\n\n143\n00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,060\nyour computer,\nit's no longer your computer.\n\n144\n00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,650\n>> That's right.\nAnd\n\n145\n00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,070\nthat's why the bad guys always want\nto use emails and things like that,\n\n146\n00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:08,300\nto get you to click on something\nbecause now you're asking for it.\n\n147\n00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,550\nIt's too easy to do sometimes but\nwe'll save that for\n\n148\n00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,110\nCEH and we'll talk about how we can\nget them to do that kinda thing.\n\n149\n00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:14,810\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n150\n00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,670\nOne of the things too to keep in mind\nwith just basic firewall implementation.\n\n151\n00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,530\nWe talk about this term exceptions.\n\n152\n00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,120\nRemember that the rule,\nagain back to that rule-based management.\n\n153\n00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,180\nThe rule says everything's blocked\ncoming in if you didn't ask for it.\n\n154\n00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,460\nExcept, maybe this piece of software.\n\n155\n00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,030\nWe do this a lot.\n\n156\n00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,570\nI think about RDP we talked about\nin an earlier segment as well,\n\n157\n00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:38,570\nwhere you have, if you have an RDP host,\nright, and an RDP host just basically is\n\n158\n00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,351\na computer that's gonna allow you to\nconnect to it from over the network.\n\n159\n00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:46,520\nWell when you,\n[LAUGH] when you end up saying,\n\n160\n00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,920\nokay, I'm gonna allow RDP, you're\nmaking the exception to the rule, and\n\n161\n00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,530\nthat's why we get that term,\nexception to the rule.\n\n162\n00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,780\nEverything's blocked except, in this case,\nMicrosoft Remote Desktop Connection.\n\n163\n00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,293\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n164\n00:07:56,293 --> 00:08:00,834\nAnd yeah, Paul, we are looking at getting\ninto, I believe that is the latest version\n\n165\n00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:04,385\nto this point, and we do wanna put\nthose on real soon, hopefully.\n\n166\n00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:07,713\nSo and when we look at firewall rules,\nwe've got what we call inbound,\n\n167\n00:08:07,713 --> 00:08:09,327\ndepending on the firewall right.\n\n168\n00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:12,892\nLike in a Windows environment we\nhave a couple different ways we can\n\n169\n00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,620\nmanage that Windows firewall.\n\n170\n00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,710\nWe've got a basic firewall console and\nwe've got an advanced firewall console.\n\n171\n00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,000\nAnd a lot of the other\n\n172\n00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,110\nfirewalls that you buy\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n173\n00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,100\n>> Software, lower end, hardware devices.\n\n174\n00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,840\nThey might be very simplistic\nwhere it just says,\n\n175\n00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,820\nyou can allow this application\nto come in or you can not.\n\n176\n00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,160\nOr if we go into Windows\n\n177\n00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,240\nfirewall with advanced security\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n178\n00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,210\n>> Or some of those higher end firewalls\nthat are a little more configurable\n\n179\n00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,349\n>> Now all of the sudden,we can\n\n180\n00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:39,780\ndifferentiate between in-ound rules and\noutbound rules.\n\n181\n00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,340\nLike maybe I want to allow a particular\nport out from my computer and\n\n182\n00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,810\nnot allow it to come in.\n\n183\n00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,530\nSo in-bound rules are gonna control\ntraffic that's destined for the device,\n\n184\n00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,800\nfor your computer if it's\na hose-based firewall for example or\n\n185\n00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,900\nif it's a Perimeter firewall, inbound\nrules are gonna control the traffic that's\n\n186\n00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,450\ncoming from the outside,\ninto your network.\n\n187\n00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Outbound rules would then be\n\n188\n00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:02,862\njust the opposite.\n\n189\n00:09:02,862 --> 00:09:04,120\n>> Right.\n>> They're gonna control data that's\n\n190\n00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,890\ninitiating from your device,\n\n191\n00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,685\nif it's a host-based firewall\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n192\n00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:10,790\n>> Or from your network if it's\na perimeter-based firewall.\n\n193\n00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,780\nWhether it's allowed\nto leave your network.\n\n194\n00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,519\nWindows has combined, and then this is\nreally it's a platform independent exam I\n\n195\n00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,290\nknow, but they do pull a lot of Microsoft\nstuff cause it's one of the more common\n\n196\n00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,330\noperating systems we end\nup working with out there.\n\n197\n00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,110\nWindows in the new console,\n\n198\n00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,550\nthe Windows firewall with the advanced\nsecurity, has combined the firewall rules,\n\n199\n00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,840\nthe inbound and outbound,\nwith their connection security rules.\n\n200\n00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,820\nWe talked about IPsec in\nour episode the other day.\n\n201\n00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,500\nIPsec is how we can encrypt that traffic\nas it's traveling across the network.\n\n202\n00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,890\nAnd if we think about it,\nI can define a rule that says, hey,\n\n203\n00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,140\nanything that comes across\nport 2021 I wanna encrypt.\n\n204\n00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,720\nSure.\n>> But\n\n205\n00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,380\nif I don't open up the firewall,\nit's not gonna allow it in.\n\n206\n00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,760\nIt might want to encrypt it but\nit's not gonna get through.\n\n207\n00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,940\nI can open up the firewall for\nthose ports but\n\n208\n00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,040\nif I don't define my connection security\nrule, then it's not going to encrypt it.\n\n209\n00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,310\nSo I gotta do both really\nif I want to protect it and\n\n210\n00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,260\nallow it through,\nwhich is why they combine it.\n\n211\n00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,180\nSo connection security rules are going\nto define what types of traffic\n\n212\n00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,290\nyou want to apply.\n\n213\n00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,120\nEither authentication, or\nencryption, or both to.\n\n214\n00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,350\n>> Yeah definitely.\n\n215\n00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,960\nAnd Mike and\nI were talking one time about.\n\n216\n00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,230\nBecause I remember first looking\nat connection security rules.\n\n217\n00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,080\nA few years back and saying,\nwell what is it doing?\n\n218\n00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,460\nYou had made a good point since\nthe firewall tells me what I can or\n\n219\n00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,180\ncan't do, or do maybe, but\nwhat type of traffic I can or\n\n220\n00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,110\ncan't allow through that firewall but\nit doesn't define\n\n221\n00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:36,070\nwhat happens to that data that we\ndo allow through the firewall.\n\n222\n00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,950\nWe can go a little bit farther and\nwe can say hey,\n\n223\n00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,270\nwe want to scramble that\ninformation as well.\n\n224\n00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,710\n>> Exactly.\n\n225\n00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,340\nAll right, so\nthose are our firewall rules, and\n\n226\n00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:48,460\nagain firewall rules are really a great\nexample of rule based management and\n\n227\n00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,900\nagain rule based management can\nalso be applied at a higher level.\n\n228\n00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,400\nYou know more at a policy level like\ncorporate documents and things like that.\n\n229\n00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,390\n>> Sure.\n>> Alright and then we got to get into our\n\n230\n00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,380\nVLAN management next.\n\n231\n00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,470\nSo VLAN management we talked about,\nI think it might have been Ronny and\n\n232\n00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,750\nNate that hit VLANs the other day.\n\n233\n00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,640\n>> Yeah definitely.\n\n234\n00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,000\n>> And we were talking about virtual LANs,\nways that I can segregate or.\n\n235\n00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,180\nDivide my network up in to\nsmaller little sub nets, but\n\n236\n00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,470\ndo it in a logical way, virtual LAN.\n\n237\n00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,070\nInstead of physically\nrewiring my network and\n\n238\n00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,870\nputting routers between each sub net, we\ncan get these layer three devices that'll\n\n239\n00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:27,080\nallow me to do some virtual LANs and\ntake a 48 port switch and\n\n240\n00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,300\ndivide it up any way I see fit, and\nmake different little sub nets out of it.\n\n241\n00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,460\nYeah.\n>> But if you can imagine having 3, 4, 10,\n\n242\n00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:39,540\n48 port switches in a rack,\nand having 15 different VLANs,\n\n243\n00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,120\nand some ports from this switch and\nsome ports from that switch, etc., etc.,\n\n244\n00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,550\nare part of VLAN 1, or 10, and these\nports and these ports are part of VLAN 2.\n\n245\n00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,780\nAnd It can be rather complex.\n\n246\n00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,540\n>> Absolutely, and one of the things, you\nalso have to think too, is that when we\n\n247\n00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,040\ntalk about LAN segments, all right,\nwe talk about a broadcast domain, right?\n\n248\n00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,500\nSwitches forward broadcast information,\n\n249\n00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,855\nand there might be a situation where\nyou don't want certain servers,\n\n250\n00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:07,310\ncause just sometimes there's broadcast\ninformation that goes out there, and\n\n251\n00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,200\nif you're on that broadcast domain, Any\ncomputer that's connected to the switch,\n\n252\n00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,260\nor has a physical\nconnection to your network,\n\n253\n00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,970\ncan hear that broadcast information.\n\n254\n00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,360\nAnd maybe for security purposes,\nwe don't want certain servers or\n\n255\n00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,990\ndevices just sending out\nbroadcast information.\n\n256\n00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:26,770\nSo it also allows you the ability\nto isolate those broadcast domains.\n\n257\n00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,600\nAnd really just.\n\n258\n00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,120\nYou can separate these computers and\nthen apply things like ACLs.\n\n259\n00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,340\nThey'll definitely talk more about it.\n\n260\n00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,280\nCheck out Ronnie and\nNate's episode about VLANs and Cisco.\n\n261\n00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,710\nThey'll talk more about those ACLs.\n\n262\n00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:43,090\nBut, it also helps to assist security\nbecause I can divide the computers\n\n263\n00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,730\nreally based on some\nkind of similar criteria.\n\n264\n00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,280\nMaybe it's a sales floor, and\n\n265\n00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,500\nwe don't have to worry about physically\nrestructuring the entire network and\n\n266\n00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,480\nwe can just treat a single switch\nlike it's multiple switches.\n\n267\n00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,460\n>> Right, if I want to move a server from\none VLAN to another it's just a matter of\n\n268\n00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,940\ngoing in and reconfiguring that switch.\n\n269\n00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,850\nSo when it comes to managing this,\n\n270\n00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,455\ntypically we're talking about using\nsome kind of diagram program.\n\n271\n00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,800\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, like Vizio or\n\n272\n00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,610\nsomething like that, where we're\ngoing to keep track of what ports\n\n273\n00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,580\nare part of what V land, and what V land\nIDs have been assigned to those ports.\n\n274\n00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,280\nAnd things like that.\n\n275\n00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,930\nBecause It can get rather complex.\n\n276\n00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,870\nSo diagrams and\n\n277\n00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,310\nsome type of documentation is the best\nway to keep track of that really.\n\n278\n00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,970\n>> And you know with V LANs.\n\n279\n00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,520\nWith the fact that it is a VLAN.\n\n280\n00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,080\nUltimately is like that layer two\ntechnology if you want information to pass\n\n281\n00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,290\nthrough VLANs you have to implement\nrouter, so you have another almost like\n\n282\n00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,120\na layer that information would have to\ngo through before it can even connect or\n\n283\n00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,124\nsend information across these VLAN's too.\n\n284\n00:13:40,124 --> 00:13:44,300\nSo not only isolating those broadcast\ndomains, you can also implement security\n\n285\n00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,500\nat the router level too and says you know,\nif I don't want communications across\n\n286\n00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,950\nthese VLAN's that it just\ndoesn't have to happen.\n\n287\n00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,170\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n288\n00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,660\nSo we've got to manage those VLAN's.\n\n289\n00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,530\nWhen it comes to routers,\nwe've got to secure our routers.\n\n290\n00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,450\nRight and\n\n291\n00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,700\nbest practice says we want to make sure\nall those routers are configured properly.\n\n292\n00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,850\nWhich kinda makes sense, why would I want\nto intentionally misconfigure a router.\n\n293\n00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,750\nBut the point is, we gotta go through and\n\n294\n00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,930\nwe gotta make sure there\nall configured properly.\n\n295\n00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,620\nThat that configuration\ninformation is kept secure and\n\n296\n00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,710\nby doing that, that's gonna make\nmy network much more efficient.\n\n297\n00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:23,630\nIt can add to the security of my network\nand prevent things like routing loops,\n\n298\n00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:28,600\nand other issues we can then run\ninto with misconfigured routers.\n\n299\n00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,940\n>> And, you know we talk about\na lot in security, we say,\n\n300\n00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,270\nsteer away from the defaults.\n\n301\n00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:36,900\nWhatever default comes,\nwhen you turn on a connectivity device\n\n302\n00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,730\nA lot of times it has\na default configuration.\n\n303\n00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,890\nAnd the default configuration\ncan really be found by anybody.\n\n304\n00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,550\nManufacturers up there, they have lists.\n\n305\n00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,630\nThey have lists that are specifically\nput together just so\n\n306\n00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,010\nyou can find\n>> Right.\n\n307\n00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,850\n>> Default configurations for\n>> Yeah.\n\n308\n00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,030\n>> Hundreds of different\nconnectivity devices.\n\n309\n00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,870\nAnd if you leave those defaults,\ndefault administrative password,\n\n310\n00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,450\ndefault configuration, then somebody\ncould exploit those defaults.\n\n311\n00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,700\nSo just like we talk about a server,\nwe talk about any application,\n\n312\n00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,590\nif somebody's doing code or building\na website, that there's certain ways that\n\n313\n00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:10,070\nyou can steer away from defaults or\nimplement checks and\n\n314\n00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,840\nbalances to make sure that only the data's\ntraversing the networks that you want.\n\n315\n00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,830\n>> Absolutely.\nUsually when you talk about hardening\n\n316\n00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:19,110\nanything, one of the first things you do\nis remove your default configuration.\n\n317\n00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,580\nLike, how many of you have a Linksys,\none of the old wrt54g's or\n\n318\n00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:27,040\nor even prior to that, or\neven one of the newer models.\n\n319\n00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,640\nAnd if you do,\n\n320\n00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,690\nI bet you knew, remember what\nthe password was when you first got it?\n\n321\n00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,080\nAnybody remember?\n\n322\n00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,710\n>> And yeah, Paula.\n\n323\n00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,150\n>> Security override there ya go.\n\n324\n00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,200\nThanks Paul.\n[LAUGH] >> That's exactly right.\n\n325\n00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,660\nThere used to be a site called\ndefaultpasswords.net and\n\n326\n00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:42,840\nI think this one has kinda taken its place\nbut yeah, and it's a legitimate thing.\n\n327\n00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,940\nIt has a legitimate purpose.\n\n328\n00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,140\nI bought this device,\nI've reset it from the person I bought it,\n\n329\n00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,160\nI wanted to wipe everything and\nI've reset it.\n\n330\n00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,700\nBut I didn't get\nthe original documentation.\n\n331\n00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,495\nI wanna know what that default\npassword was so I can log back in.\n\n332\n00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:58,120\nBut it also has a malicious\nside to it too.\n\n333\n00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,066\n>> Or you can do like Wes did,\n\n334\n00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:01,565\nand you can set the password and\nyou can forget what the password was.\n\n335\n00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:02,604\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n336\n00:16:02,604 --> 00:16:03,161\n>> And then have to do a hard reset.\n\n337\n00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:05,668\nSet on the router or whatever\nthe connectivity device might give.\n\n338\n00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:06,982\nIn this case it's my home router.\n\n339\n00:16:06,982 --> 00:16:08,797\n>> I've been there, done that.\n\n340\n00:16:08,797 --> 00:16:11,640\n>> It's like oh wait,\nI just set the password up.\n\n341\n00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,280\nWhat was it?\n\n342\n00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,210\nI should have wrote that\ndown because that's secure.\n\n343\n00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:14,900\n>> Yeah, one more time.\n\n344\n00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,560\nI'm gonna reset it again.\n\n345\n00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,840\nSet up my DHCP all over again.\n\n346\n00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,440\nBut for those of you that had that\nlittle Linxsys, it was admin, right?\n\n347\n00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,960\nAnd everybody that's\never had one knows that.\n\n348\n00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,250\nYou think, well,\nhow are people gonna know what I got?\n\n349\n00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,020\nLike, great place.\n\n350\n00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,780\nAnd this is, again,\nprobably more a little towards CEH.\n\n351\n00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:37,444\nBut I look at job advertisements, and\nI see that this place is looking for\n\n352\n00:16:37,444 --> 00:16:42,111\nsomebody that specializes in Cisco and\nparticularly these 4550s or\n\n353\n00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:43,510\nblah-blah-blah.\n\n354\n00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:46,520\nWell, that's telling me that now I know\nwhat type of devices that are running on\n\n355\n00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,440\nthat network, right?\n\n356\n00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,310\nSo when I got to try to break into this\nplace, I already know the equipment that\n\n357\n00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,690\nthey're running, and maybe I can go see if\nthey've changed those default passwords.\n\n358\n00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:59,250\nYou'd be surprised how at many people\ndo not change those default passwords\n\n359\n00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,450\non those things.\n\n360\n00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,406\nSo yeah, making sure that those routers\nare secure, following your vendor's best\n\n361\n00:17:04,406 --> 00:17:08,027\npractices, and as Wes says, getting\nrid of those default configurations is\n\n362\n00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,166\nreally gonna take a big step towards\nkeeping that network secure.\n\n363\n00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,117\n>> Yeah, and we're gonna talk more\nabout wireless security coming up, but\n\n364\n00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:17,029\na lot of times we're not just talking\nabout enterprise level, either.\n\n365\n00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:21,301\nYou know, with our home routers today,\nthey're basically multifunctioning\n\n366\n00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:24,364\ndevices where they provide\nthe routing functionality,\n\n367\n00:17:24,364 --> 00:17:26,736\nthey provide the wireless functionality.\n\n368\n00:17:26,736 --> 00:17:30,440\nThey also provide the switching\nfunctionality all in one single device.\n\n369\n00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,280\nSo even with home wireless devices like\nthat, which we're going to get into,\n\n370\n00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,792\nyou also have to steer away from the\ndefaults, you know, default channels and\n\n371\n00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:41,410\nstuff like that, which we'll go into\na little bit more in a later episode.\n\n372\n00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,250\nBecause remember,\npart of security is availability.\n\n373\n00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,290\nThat's one thing that we can't lose\nsight of, is that I can secure my data.\n\n374\n00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,050\nI can make it so secure that what I do is,\nI put it in a safe,\n\n375\n00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,090\nI weld the safe shut, I pour it in\nsolid concrete, and then I take it, and\n\n376\n00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,375\nthrow it in the Bermuda Triangle.\n\n377\n00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, outside of a little salt water,\n\n378\n00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,200\nI'd say it's probably going to\nmaintain its integrity too.\n\n379\n00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,236\nAnd it's certainly confidential, but\nit's no longer any good to anybody.\n\n380\n00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:04,296\nSo availability is also making sure that\nwe're not susceptible to things like\n\n381\n00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:08,539\ndenial of service, attacks to where the\nlegitimate people have access to the data\n\n382\n00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:12,740\nthat they should and we maintain a certain\nlevel of stability and productivity.\n\n383\n00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,052\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n384\n00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:19,900\nAll right, next on our list is\ngoing to be access control lists.\n\n385\n00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,160\nNow, I'll tell you it's funny for\nme cuz I'm a Windows guy, right.\n\n386\n00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,240\nI'm a server admin, and\nthat's kind of my thing, and\n\n387\n00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,530\nthen security is also CEH and\nthings like that.\n\n388\n00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,610\nBut I'm not the Cisco guy.\n\n389\n00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:36,210\nWe've got Ronnie, Don, you guys are much\nmore into the Cisco than I have been.\n\n390\n00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,770\n>> Oh, not me. [LAUGH] >> And so\nwhen I first think of access control,\n\n391\n00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:42,210\nthe first thing I think of is my\ndiscretionary access control list.\n\n392\n00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:42,770\n>> Permissions.\n\n393\n00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,340\n>> And on my NTFS file systems, exactly.\n\n394\n00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,730\nAnd that is one type of access control, as\nin probably most of you at this point in\n\n395\n00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,175\nyour career are familiar\nwith working with those.\n\n396\n00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:56,260\nThey're just like when you look\nin a Windows environment on NTFS,\n\n397\n00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,890\nand Linux has the same thing,\na little bit different permissions but\n\n398\n00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,090\nthey've got the same\nconcept that we can set.\n\n399\n00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:07,050\nIt's just a list of identities, users or\ngroups or computer accounts, or whatever.\n\n400\n00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:11,260\nAnd then I can use that list to\nspecify what level of access,\n\n401\n00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,570\nif any, that they have.\n\n402\n00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,560\nWe can also deny access\nwith these lists as well.\n\n403\n00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:20,700\nAnd that's our file system access\ncontrollers but in the security plus,\n\n404\n00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,090\nwe've also got to think about networking\naccess controllers, all right.\n\n405\n00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:30,350\nTypically implemented on your routers and\non your switches, and here we'd be talking\n\n406\n00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:36,020\nabout setting up rules based on\neither port numbers or IP addresses.\n\n407\n00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,610\nIt can be done with DNS, with names.\n\n408\n00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,713\nBut usually it'll hamper your\nperformance because now all of a sudden\n\n409\n00:19:43,713 --> 00:19:48,989\nyour switch is gonna have to resolve\nthose names back into an IP address,\n\n410\n00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:53,980\nso typically done with just\nstraight up IP addresses.\n\n411\n00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,460\nYeah, and that's what I think too.\n\n412\n00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,470\nWhen I think of ACLs,\n\n413\n00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:01,660\njust because Cisco's not really my\nrealm at all, I think of permissions.\n\n414\n00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,020\nI think of the access control list that\nyou use to control what level of action or\n\n415\n00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,020\nactions can be performed on\na resource within a Windows domain or\n\n416\n00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,620\njust, like you said, NTFS doesn't\nnecessarily have to be a domain.\n\n417\n00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,530\nBut within the operating system itself.\n\n418\n00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,710\nAnd Linux and Unix, they all have these\ndifferent permissions, if you will,\n\n419\n00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,575\nthat just define a level of access\nthat somebody has and if we call it.\n\n420\n00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:24,305\nBut what do we call that,\nwe call it, well, you said it,\n\n421\n00:20:24,305 --> 00:20:26,945\ndiscretionary access control,\nit's based on identity.\n\n422\n00:20:26,945 --> 00:20:30,685\nIdentity, if you are this person,\nthen you get this level of access.\n\n423\n00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:33,675\nIf you're part of this group,\nyou get a certain level of, or\n\n424\n00:20:33,675 --> 00:20:35,515\nyou don't get a certain\nlevel of access as well.\n\n425\n00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:38,120\n>> Right.\nYeah, exactly, exactly.\n\n426\n00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,730\nSo just keep in mind for this exam,\nwhen they talk about access control list,\n\n427\n00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,330\nmake sure you're looking at\nit in context of the question\n\n428\n00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:46,200\nbecause they might be referring to\nfile system access control list.\n\n429\n00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,230\nThey might also be referring to\nnetworking access control list,\n\n430\n00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,870\nwhich are implemented on your routers and\n\n431\n00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,710\nswitches that are defining rules like\nwe talked about with the rule base.\n\n432\n00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,748\nYou know, firewalls are a perfect example\nof network access control lists, right,\n\n433\n00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:02,562\nbecause we're making rules that say this\nparticular network range is allowed to\n\n434\n00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:05,702\npass through this router but\nonly on these particular protocols or\n\n435\n00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:08,366\nthese particular port numbers or\nsomething like that.\n\n436\n00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:12,540\n>> Sure, well look at Microsoft's website,\njust famous microsoft.com.\n\n437\n00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,838\nYou know, they've got access control lists\nthat basically say there's gonna be no\n\n438\n00:21:16,838 --> 00:21:19,864\nICMP traffic coming back out of\ntheir network letting you or\n\n439\n00:21:19,864 --> 00:21:23,860\nexposing them to some kind of distributive\ndenial of service attack or again,\n\n440\n00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,515\na lot of time like DOS and stuff.\n\n441\n00:21:25,515 --> 00:21:29,342\nAnd yeah, so, you know, that information's\nnot gonna be let outbound so\n\n442\n00:21:29,342 --> 00:21:33,417\nthat's interesting, that's an outbound\nrule that might define that you're\n\n443\n00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,934\nnot gonna allow that\ntraffic out of our network.\n\n444\n00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:38,460\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n445\n00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,525\nAll right, so\nthose are our access control lists.\n\n446\n00:21:40,525 --> 00:21:42,840\nWe also need to discuss\ngood old port security.\n\n447\n00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,176\nAnd when it comes, again,\nit's a basic hardening technique, right?\n\n448\n00:21:47,176 --> 00:21:49,498\nI mean, it's why we implement\nfirewalls in the first place.\n\n449\n00:21:49,498 --> 00:21:54,265\nFor example, perimeter firewalls,\nhost-based firewalls, and\n\n450\n00:21:54,265 --> 00:21:58,062\nreally on all of our\nsystems typically nowadays.\n\n451\n00:21:58,062 --> 00:22:03,822\nBut disabling unnecessary services,\nclosing off ports that are not in use.\n\n452\n00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:08,489\nYou know, one of your basic,\nfundamental hardening techniques is,\n\n453\n00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,620\nas we said, changing my default settings,\nright, getting rid of those defaults.\n\n454\n00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,500\nThe second thing we do is\ndisable unnecessary services and\n\n455\n00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,960\nclose unnecessary ports.\n\n456\n00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,210\nIf I'm not using an FTP\nserver on my network,\n\n457\n00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,870\nwhy the heck am I gonna have port 20 and\n21 open?\n\n458\n00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,350\nWhat is the possible benefit of that?\n\n459\n00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,343\n>> There's really nothing,\nit's just what you say,\n\n460\n00:22:29,343 --> 00:22:31,710\nit increases your attack surface\ncuz it's an attack vector.\n\n461\n00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,660\nSo it's a point of entry\ninto your network and\n\n462\n00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,630\nyou mentioned it again earlier in one\nof the other segments that it allows,\n\n463\n00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,150\nif people don't set it up,\nthe FTP can be secure.\n\n464\n00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,660\nWe've talked about the wherever the S is,\nif it's on the front or\n\n465\n00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,700\nif it's on the bottom so.\n\n466\n00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,075\nYou guys were there with\nthe alphabet too you on that one.\n\n467\n00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:48,910\n>> I want my VPN first and\nthen go FTP across that.\n\n468\n00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,300\n>> That's right, but by itself if it's\na default configuration it allows for\n\n469\n00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,150\nanonymous logon.\n\n470\n00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,800\nIf you mentioned the ten\nimmutable laws of security.\n\n471\n00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,336\nIf I have access to your server-\n>> It's no longer your server.\n\n472\n00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:00,466\n>> It's no longer your server,\nand it leads out to,\n\n473\n00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:02,354\nI think it's called the FTP bounce attack.\n\n474\n00:23:02,354 --> 00:23:05,062\nAnd then if I can access your server,\nthen from your server\n\n475\n00:23:05,062 --> 00:23:09,000\nI can attack somebody else and guess what,\nit's not gonna be tracked back to me.\n\n476\n00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,590\n>> Right, right.\n\n477\n00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,449\n>> So in due diligence also,\nyou know, this comes along and\n\n478\n00:23:11,449 --> 00:23:12,586\nit's shutting those ports down.\n\n479\n00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:15,585\nThe other thing you can do with port\nsecurity, too, and I was talking to Ronnie\n\n480\n00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:18,147\non this one, was that they can do\nkind of like a MAC filtering list.\n\n481\n00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:21,513\nThey can say, okay, if information comes\ninto this port based on a MAC address,\n\n482\n00:23:21,513 --> 00:23:23,358\nit's either allowed or denied as well too.\n\n483\n00:23:23,358 --> 00:23:25,450\nSo you could define that as well.\n\n484\n00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,200\n>> Exactly, exactly so\ngetting rid of those.\n\n485\n00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,883\nYou know, if you don't need those\nservices, that's just, as Wes said,\n\n486\n00:23:29,883 --> 00:23:31,995\nit's making your attack surface larger.\n\n487\n00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:36,860\nAnd if you're not using it,\nthen you're not monitoring it properly.\n\n488\n00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,180\nRight, you're not checking the log files.\n\n489\n00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,650\nGoing, hey,\nwe're not running an FTP server,\n\n490\n00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,760\nwhy am I even gonna look at my FTP logs?\n\n491\n00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,340\nSo Windows used to be, they've really\n\n492\n00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,770\ngone 180 in they way they handle their\nserver operating systems, for example.\n\n493\n00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:53,090\nBack in 2000 when you installed Windows,\nI mean, everything was wide open.\n\n494\n00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,034\nI remember installing IIS in Server\n2000 and when you were done,\n\n495\n00:23:57,034 --> 00:23:58,330\nyou had an IIS server.\n\n496\n00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:03,910\nBut you also had an FTP server, you had\nan NNTP server, you had a time server.\n\n497\n00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,676\nAll I did was check IIS and\nit installed like three or\n\n498\n00:24:06,676 --> 00:24:08,746\nfour other things that I did not need.\n\n499\n00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:13,330\nGo to 2012 and it's just the opposite\nwhere it's very, very modular.\n\n500\n00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:17,070\nIf you install IIS, it'll install it but\nit didn't add any security protocols.\n\n501\n00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,300\nSo you've got no authentication methods,\nyou forgot to check those.\n\n502\n00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,190\nI mean it makes you specify\nevery little thing you want.\n\n503\n00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,796\nSo it makes it easier for me as a security\nguy to harden because I didn't install all\n\n504\n00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:28,010\nthese unnecessary things\nin the first place.\n\n505\n00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,060\n>> Yep, and\nyou ask something like what can I do?\n\n506\n00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,790\nAgain, we're talking I know\na lot about Windows here but\n\n507\n00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,910\nthat's because it's gonna\nbe called out on the exam.\n\n508\n00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,730\nMaybe not specifically this topic, but\n\n509\n00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,520\nI look at that Security\nconfiguration wizard.\n\n510\n00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,230\nIt's just a tool within a Windows server\nthat allows you to go through, and\n\n511\n00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:47,170\nwhat you aren't using, it will disable.\n\n512\n00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,089\n>> Right.\n>> And by the way,\n\n513\n00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:50,692\nif you've got a remote desktop\nconnection into a server,\n\n514\n00:24:50,692 --> 00:24:53,572\nnever run into the remote desktop\ncuz it closes that down, too.\n\n515\n00:24:53,572 --> 00:24:54,176\n>> It will top you off there.\n\n516\n00:24:54,176 --> 00:24:56,200\n>> And then you're on speaker deck.\n\n517\n00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,090\n>> I tell you what, it is amazing\ncuz I know running that a few times,\n\n518\n00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,500\nand it always amazes me cuz\nif you haven't seen it,\n\n519\n00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,030\nwe'll talk about it in one\nof our server classes.\n\n520\n00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,810\nIt goes through and\nbasically helps you harden your server.\n\n521\n00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:10,120\nAnd when you get done, it gives you a list\nof all the things that it's gonna change.\n\n522\n00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,954\nAnd there are so many services that\nwere set to either be automatic or\n\n523\n00:25:13,954 --> 00:25:17,480\nmanual start that it's gonna\nchange over to disable.\n\n524\n00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,770\nAnd it's like, wait.\n\n525\n00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,841\nAll these things can be changed and\ndisabled and\n\n526\n00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:24,326\nit's not gonna affect my server in anyway,\nwhy were they on in the first place?\n\n527\n00:25:24,326 --> 00:25:27,109\nSo there's a lot to really\nhardening those servers and\n\n528\n00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,054\nhardening those operating systems.\n\n529\n00:25:29,054 --> 00:25:29,921\n>> And what's interesting,\n\n530\n00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:32,640\nI was just thinking about it, that kinda\ngoes back to rule-based management, too.\n\n531\n00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,570\nBecause then you can export that policy\nand it become the default baseline for\n\n532\n00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,930\nevery other server that\nyou're gonna implement too.\n\n533\n00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:43,650\nSo kinda like a beehive,\nit all kinda intertwines together.\n\n534\n00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,154\n>> And another thing,\none more thing about port security.\n\n535\n00:25:46,154 --> 00:25:50,550\nAnother thing we can do is changing\nthe way the systems respond.\n\n536\n00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,133\nI think Wes mentioned yesterday\nsomething called fingerprinting,\n\n537\n00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:57,591\nwhere I can based on the response\nthat I'm getting from the ports,\n\n538\n00:25:57,591 --> 00:26:00,140\nI can tell whether or\nnot the port is open.\n\n539\n00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,860\nAnd also, different operating\nsystems respond differently\n\n540\n00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,590\nif the port's open versus if the port\nis closed and things like that.\n\n541\n00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,540\nSo I can fingerprint that\nOS as well as try to figure\n\n542\n00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,180\nout what services you're offering.\n\n543\n00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:15,570\nSo there are ways we can go in and\nwe can change the way those ports respond.\n\n544\n00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:19,446\nWe can hide those default responses so\nit doesn't make it so easy for\n\n545\n00:26:19,446 --> 00:26:22,370\nthese bad guys to go do a port\nscan on your machine and\n\n546\n00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,382\nknow immediately that you're\nrunning 2012 Server and IIS NFTP.\n\n547\n00:26:26,382 --> 00:26:26,892\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n548\n00:26:26,892 --> 00:26:27,751\n>> And things like that.\n\n549\n00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:32,130\nSo it helps us again harden our\nsystems and keep my network safe.\n\n550\n00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,029\n>> And it's scary, I mean when you\nlook at it, if somebody came and\n\n551\n00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:37,607\nI mean I know if they get\nphysical access to your network,\n\n552\n00:26:37,607 --> 00:26:41,125\nyou don't ramming some of the ACLs,\nyou've got bigger problems than that.\n\n553\n00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:42,274\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n554\n00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:44,157\n>> But when true ports scan against like\n\n555\n00:26:44,157 --> 00:26:48,590\na domain controller that's running IIS,\nit's very easy to tell what's going on.\n\n556\n00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,080\nCuz like I think it was Paul\nthat mentioned in the chat room.\n\n557\n00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,826\nHe mentioned SMB tracking traffic,\nright, we mentioned that BIOS traffic.\n\n558\n00:26:53,826 --> 00:26:57,960\nSo if I've got SMB traffic\ngoing on 4389 going on,\n\n559\n00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,870\nport 3389 that I definitely know that\nI'm running a Microsoft product.\n\n560\n00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,780\nAnd we know that, hey, now you're\nrunning an active directory domain.\n\n561\n00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:08,310\nOh, see port 53 probably got\nan integrated active directory DNS zone.\n\n562\n00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:11,490\nSo you can just start going down this list\nand you're like, yep, I know what it is,\n\n563\n00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,136\nand I know what this is.\n\n564\n00:27:12,136 --> 00:27:14,047\nNow we've got web-based attacks and\n\n565\n00:27:14,047 --> 00:27:17,350\nit really just launches yourself\ninto other types of exploits.\n\n566\n00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,000\n>> Exactly.\n>> Well,\n\n567\n00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,640\nI'm not done launching you into it.\n\n568\n00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,588\nThey launch towards you.\n\n569\n00:27:20,588 --> 00:27:23,480\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It depends on which\n\n570\n00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,320\nhat I'm wearing.\n\n571\n00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,380\nI always tell people after midnight,\nthe black hat goes on, right?\n\n572\n00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,630\nI got my white hat on all during the day,\nbut after midnight and I'm home,\n\n573\n00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:31,952\nthe black hat might come out.\n\n574\n00:27:31,952 --> 00:27:32,648\n>> Perfect.\n\n575\n00:27:32,648 --> 00:27:37,281\n>> 802.1X\n>> 802.1X, AKA radius, right?\n\n576\n00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:39,930\n>> Yeah, port-based authentication.\n\n577\n00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,790\n>> It is, good old IEEE standard.\n\n578\n00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,800\nDon't get confused with this one.\n\n579\n00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,950\nThey usually list this, and\nI believe they do in this book as well, or\n\n580\n00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:50,220\nwhen you're reading a lot of\nthese security plus books,\n\n581\n00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,310\nthey always list it along\nwith the wireless protocols.\n\n582\n00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,179\n>> Yes.\n>> Right?\n\n583\n00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:58,862\nAnd that is not 802.11X,\nall right, that's 802.1X.\n\n584\n00:27:58,862 --> 00:28:03,430\nIt can be used with wireless networks,\nit can also be used with wired networks,\n\n585\n00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:08,700\nwith my 802.1X enabled switches, my\n802.1X enabled routers or access points.\n\n586\n00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,310\nSo it is a port-based authentication.\n\n587\n00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:15,668\nAnd it gives us a way to authenticate\na user or device before they're allowed to\n\n588\n00:28:15,668 --> 00:28:18,980\nactually establish that\nconnection through that port.\n\n589\n00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:23,550\n>> That's right, and yes, it's used in\ncombination with something like 802.11.\n\n590\n00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:28,445\nBut remember that when they\nabbreviate the whole entire family of\n\n591\n00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:33,251\nthe wireless standards,\nthe X is really just a variable cuz they\n\n592\n00:28:33,251 --> 00:28:38,160\ndon't wanna write out 802.11A,\nB, G, N, AC, and AD.\n\n593\n00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,250\nWe've got all of these coming out.\n\n594\n00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,290\nSo they just say X,\nit's 11X, it's everything.\n\n595\n00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,110\nBut 1X is different.\n\n596\n00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,700\nAnd when you look at 802.11,\nwe're talking about layer two technology.\n\n597\n00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,690\nAnd we're really talking about at\nthis point with port base security,\n\n598\n00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,740\na physical layer of security\nimplementation that\n\n599\n00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,920\ncan happen regardless of whether it's a\nwired connection or a radiated connection.\n\n600\n00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,840\nBut it's still a layer one type of\nsecurity implementation that says,\n\n601\n00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,080\nyou know what, you're gonna communicate\nwith the authentication server.\n\n602\n00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,600\nBut I'm gonna close the port, and\nI'm gonna act like a middle man, or if you\n\n603\n00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,850\nwill, and I'm gonna go ahead and talk\nto that authentication server for you.\n\n604\n00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,830\nAnd you don't even get access\nto my network to start with.\n\n605\n00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:18,980\nYou don't get to send some kinda\nmodified authentication packet, maybe,\n\n606\n00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:24,070\ncuz authentication servers are geared to\nrespond back to an authentication request.\n\n607\n00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:28,140\nSo if I can modify those packets and send\n100,000 of them in there, no longer can\n\n608\n00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,720\nany legitimate person, whether it's\nwireless or wired, get on your network.\n\n609\n00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,400\nSo we closed the port down.\n\n610\n00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,370\nAnd we say, you know what, we'll let the\naccess point negotiate behind the scene\n\n611\n00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:37,910\nsecurity for you, and\nyou don't gain access to our network.\n\n612\n00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:38,780\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n613\n00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,800\nAnd typically you're using what, like EAP?\n\n614\n00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,650\nYour Extensible Authentication Protocol,\nwhich we'll talk a little bit\n\n615\n00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:46,910\nmore about when we're doing\nthat port-based authentication.\n\n616\n00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,130\nBut that brings us right\nup to about 30 minutes,\n\n617\n00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,560\nso we're at a good stopping point,\nI think.\n\n618\n00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,410\nYou got anything you wanna throw\nout before we take a break?\n\n619\n00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:55,800\n>> No, not at all.\n\n620\n00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,087\n>> All right, well, we're gonna take\na quick break, take five minutes.\n\n621\n00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:01,056\nYou guys get up, get some refreshments,\nand we'll see you back here in a few.\n\n622\n00:30:01,056 --> 00:30:04,572\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n623\n00:30:04,572 --> 00:30:10,205\nwelcome back, everybody!\n\n624\n00:30:10,205 --> 00:30:14,600\nSo, we left off talking about,\nI've got the wrong notes up here.\n\n625\n00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,700\nWe left off talking about 802.1X, right?\n\n626\n00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:23,850\nA little port-based authentication, and\nnow we're gonna move on into flood guards.\n\n627\n00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:24,450\nFlood guards.\n\n628\n00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,840\nSo these are people that\nguard us against floods?\n\n629\n00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,410\n>> That's right, we get plywood,\n\n630\n00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:32,635\nand when the hurricane, oh wait, I think\nwe're probably in the wrong area here.\n\n631\n00:30:32,635 --> 00:30:36,820\nSo flood guards we have to worry about\nbecause as we'll talk about, and\n\n632\n00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,850\nhave talked about in other episodes,\nwe've got these types of attacks that\n\n633\n00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:42,550\ntry to consume our bandwidth,\ntry to bring out servers offline,\n\n634\n00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:46,318\nknown as distributed denial of service or\neven just basic denial of service attacks.\n\n635\n00:30:46,318 --> 00:30:48,850\nAnd flood guards,\nessentially what they're gonna do for\n\n636\n00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:53,000\nus is they're gonna stop unwanted\nexcess traffic and stuff.\n\n637\n00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,285\nAnd there's different types of\nattacks out there and stuff.\n\n638\n00:30:55,285 --> 00:30:59,910\n>> Yeah, so we're talking about floods of\nnetwork traffic, not floods of water or\n\n639\n00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,186\nanything like that, so\nbe careful with that.\n\n640\n00:31:01,186 --> 00:31:04,030\nI mean, I know when I first look at it,\nthe first thing I think of is\n\n641\n00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:07,310\nthose special drainage that where\nwhen the water level starts rising\n\n642\n00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,990\nthese drains have a plug in them that\nwill come up and hit the bottom.\n\n643\n00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,285\nAnd it won't let the water\nflood back into your room or\n\n644\n00:31:12,285 --> 00:31:14,280\nsomething like your server closet.\n\n645\n00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,580\nNot what they're talking about here.\n\n646\n00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,620\nMake sure you're looking at it in context,\nright?\n\n647\n00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:22,140\nSo, as Wes says, different types of\nnetwork attacks that are gonna flood your\n\n648\n00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,320\nnetwork with-\n>> Excess amounts of traffic and stuff.\n\n649\n00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,220\nWe have basic denial of service\nattacks that routers and\n\n650\n00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:35,360\nstuff that can stop, like ICMP,\nany excess information or\n\n651\n00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,930\nunnecessary excess information that's\ncoming in, we can just let go.\n\n652\n00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,280\nOr the router could just\nreject that information.\n\n653\n00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,120\nBut when it comes to stuff that looks like\nlegitimate traffic that's where these\n\n654\n00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,200\nflood guards come in.\n\n655\n00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,290\nAnd we're not talking about\njust excess information but\n\n656\n00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:53,400\nwe're looking at literally traffic that\nIP addresses look like they should.\n\n657\n00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,170\nIt looks like it came from\na legitimate source and\n\n658\n00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:58,070\nat that point it's not gonna really\nbe considered excess traffic anymore.\n\n659\n00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,155\nAnd now we've got to go\na little bit more technical.\n\n660\n00:32:00,155 --> 00:32:04,202\n>> We'll get into things like\nfraggle attacks, and Smurf attacks,\n\n661\n00:32:04,202 --> 00:32:05,367\nthings like that.\n\n662\n00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:08,037\n>> Like SYN flood attacks,\nthey can happen.\n\n663\n00:32:08,037 --> 00:32:08,606\nSo.\n>> SQL.\n\n664\n00:32:08,606 --> 00:32:09,303\nSQL Slammer.\n\n665\n00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:09,871\n>> Oh.\n\n666\n00:32:09,871 --> 00:32:12,973\n>> It would just generate so much,\nwe know about worms and stuff and\n\n667\n00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:14,478\nwe're gonna talk about them.\n\n668\n00:32:14,478 --> 00:32:18,350\nAnd they generate so much traffic on\nyour network that it ends up doing\n\n669\n00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:23,410\na denial-of-service even though that\nwasn't the original intention of the worm.\n\n670\n00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:27,115\nIt generates so much trying to reproduce\nthat it would shut your network down.\n\n671\n00:32:27,115 --> 00:32:28,322\n>> Yeah.\n>> It was bad.\n\n672\n00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:32,560\nSo,flood guards can help look for that\nexcess traffic and try to eliminate it or\n\n673\n00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,190\ntry to prevent it.\n\n674\n00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:36,660\nShut that port down, maybe, depending\non what level of flood guard you have.\n\n675\n00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,510\n>> Yeah definitely.\n\n676\n00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,050\nThe flood guards have a little\nbit more logic in them.\n\n677\n00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:44,820\nAgain, when you have a source IP\naddress that looks like a legitimate\n\n678\n00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,230\npublic IP address, I mean, there's no\nreal way for these connectivity devices,\n\n679\n00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,310\nwho are their whole existence is\nto forward legitimate traffic.\n\n680\n00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:54,500\nSo they can do things like keep an eye,\nkeep it monitoring\n\n681\n00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,350\nthe state of the communications,\nthe state of the connections, and that.\n\n682\n00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:02,390\nAnd again, it's just the devices\nhave to look a little bit\n\n683\n00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,950\ndeeper into the information and\nthat's where the flood guards help.\n\n684\n00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,260\n>> And then some of them can actually,\n\n685\n00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,365\nlike I said, do something about\nit where they can mitigate it.\n\n686\n00:33:09,365 --> 00:33:11,230\n>> Countermeasures.\n>> They can maybe shut that port down.\n\n687\n00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,660\nIf they see what port all that\naccess traffic is coming through,\n\n688\n00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,290\nthey can shut it down.\n\n689\n00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:18,766\nAnd then we can go take a look at it, find\nout what it is, eliminate that source, and\n\n690\n00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:19,971\nthen open that port back up.\n\n691\n00:33:19,971 --> 00:33:20,772\n>> Yep.\n>> Something like that.\n\n692\n00:33:20,772 --> 00:33:22,294\n>> Yep\n>> All right,\n\n693\n00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:24,220\nthen we got good old loop protection.\n\n694\n00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:24,980\nLoop protection.\n\n695\n00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,310\nAnd this is a situation that we run into\n\n696\n00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,780\ntypically when we have\nsomething misconfigured, right?\n\n697\n00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,440\nWhen we haven't done our job properly.\n\n698\n00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,640\nWe talked earlier about making sure that\nour routers were properly configured.\n\n699\n00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,940\nSo in its basic sense.\n\n700\n00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:43,110\nA loop just means there's more than one\nroute between two particular end points.\n\n701\n00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:46,740\nAnd so as these routers are forwarding\nthat data from subnet to subnet or\n\n702\n00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,960\nacross network to network,\non the way to the destination,\n\n703\n00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,080\nwhen one of those routers picks it up,\nit sees two different ways to send it.\n\n704\n00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,300\nHe sends it back the other way kinda,\nand it just ends up looping around.\n\n705\n00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,350\nAnd usually it'll go until\nthe hop count expires, and\n\n706\n00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,630\nthen the package is gonna get dropped.\n\n707\n00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,070\nSo the packet never makes\nit to the destination.\n\n708\n00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,646\nSo we eliminate that by just\ndoing good configuration, right?\n\n709\n00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:11,049\n>> Yeah.\nAnd it can happen too when you have links\n\n710\n00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:11,970\nthat fail.\n\n711\n00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:15,880\nAnd maybe one connectivity device, it's\ntoo far down the chain depending on how\n\n712\n00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,160\nit's setup and\nwhat kinda protocols you're using.\n\n713\n00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,360\nBut it's too far down the chain to be\neven aware that that link has failed.\n\n714\n00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,750\nAnd closer devices, connectivity devices,\nare aware that it fails.\n\n715\n00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,480\nAnd they talk back to that first router.\n\n716\n00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,650\nThat first router says, yeah,\nyou can send it to me, I'll go ahead and\n\n717\n00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:33,610\ntake care of that and\nthe whole time when you, that router says,\n\n718\n00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,290\nokay well I'll send that\ninformation back to you,\n\n719\n00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,349\nthe first router say-\n>> Right\n\n720\n00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:38,045\n>> Well, okay you are how I get there, so\n\n721\n00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:39,555\nit sends it back to the first guy.\n\n722\n00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:41,709\n>> Right yeah, yeah\n>> And it just keeps happening.\n\n723\n00:34:41,709 --> 00:34:43,265\nThe switching loops can happen two\n\n724\n00:34:43,265 --> 00:34:43,953\nlayer two-\n>> Yes\n\n725\n00:34:43,953 --> 00:34:46,711\n>> Loops where you have multiple pathways\n\n726\n00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:51,053\nthat exist and you'll definitely\nsee a lot of this in Cisco and\n\n727\n00:34:51,053 --> 00:34:55,581\nI'm talking about the spanning\ntree protocol and how it works.\n\n728\n00:34:55,581 --> 00:34:59,579\nThat it's just a way that we can designate\nwhich ports are allowed to forward\n\n729\n00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:02,090\ninformation and\nwhich ports need to shut down.\n\n730\n00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,420\nAnd it's just an algorithm\nthat's set in place and\n\n731\n00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:08,660\nit goes through all the selection process,\nand you guys check this Cisco\n\n732\n00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,560\nepisodes out, you can learn a lot\nabout how that's actually implemented.\n\n733\n00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:14,906\n>> Very good, very good, all right.\n\n734\n00:35:14,906 --> 00:35:16,419\nSo that takes care of our loop protection,\n\n735\n00:35:16,419 --> 00:35:18,950\nagain making sure your routers\nare properly configured.\n\n736\n00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,320\nAnd then we're gonna go into\na concept called implicit deny.\n\n737\n00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,930\nAnd we see this used a lot of places.\n\n738\n00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,810\nIn fact, it's a default way\nof dealing with a file folder\n\n739\n00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:31,070\nlevel access in Windows,\nbut the concept is.\n\n740\n00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:36,060\nThat we're basically going to deny\neverything unless it's explicitly allowed,\n\n741\n00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:40,000\nit's denied, and\nI don't have to explicitly deny it.\n\n742\n00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,620\nI use it, it's a silly example but\n\n743\n00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:46,930\nif you think about the VIP\nline at the club, right.\n\n744\n00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,930\nAnd that guys got this list and\n\n745\n00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,330\nthese are the people that\nare going to be allowed in.\n\n746\n00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,630\nI go up there and they don't let me in.\n\n747\n00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,570\nThey look at the list.\n\n748\n00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,790\nI'm not on there.\n\n749\n00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:56,840\nAnd I don't get in.\n\n750\n00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,180\nThey didn't have to put me on there and\nsay don't let Mike in.\n\n751\n00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,130\nIf I'm not on the list, I don't get in.\n\n752\n00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,980\nThat's an implicit deny, right?\n\n753\n00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,880\nSo everything is denied unless\nyou're explicitly allowed, and\n\n754\n00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,740\nthat's the way most of\nour firewalls are set up.\n\n755\n00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:13,920\nWe talked about how they basically drop\neverything until we make those exceptions.\n\n756\n00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,590\nNTFS permissions are the same way.\n\n757\n00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,240\nYou can explicitly deny somebody.\n\n758\n00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,010\nI can go in there and i can say Ronnie\nWong you do not get access to this file.\n\n759\n00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,150\nBut I don't have to.\n\n760\n00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,410\nIf I don't put him on the list and\n\n761\n00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:29,850\ngive him at least read permission,\nhe doesn't get access to that file.\n\n762\n00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:33,244\n>> Yeah, big difference between you\nnot being put on the VIP list and\n\n763\n00:36:33,244 --> 00:36:36,836\nthen maybe somebody not paying their\nbill for the VIP extravaganza.\n\n764\n00:36:36,836 --> 00:36:39,808\nAnd then they say, well, a person\ndidn't pay their bill last time so\n\n765\n00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,870\nwe're not going to allow them in here.\n\n766\n00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,140\nAnd that's an explicit deny.\n\n767\n00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,600\nThat's not just leaving you off the list.\n\n768\n00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,330\nThat's a no.\n\n769\n00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:48,560\nYou aren't gonna be come\nback in here if you will.\n\n770\n00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,318\n>> So, let's make sure we understand too,\nthen, what is the difference?\n\n771\n00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:53,850\nIf an implicit deny means\nI don't get access and\n\n772\n00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,770\nan explicit deny means I don't get access.\n\n773\n00:36:56,770 --> 00:36:58,190\nWhat the heck's the difference?\n\n774\n00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,900\nWell, the key here is that an explicit\ndeny, you're not getting access.\n\n775\n00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,070\nIf I put you on the list and\n\n776\n00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:06,660\nI say nope, you do not get access,\nyou don't get access.\n\n777\n00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,450\nNo matter what other groups, for example,\n\n778\n00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:13,260\nyou belong to, no matter who you happen\nto be standing next to in that VIP line.\n\n779\n00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,450\nYou're on the list, you're not getting in.\n\n780\n00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,080\nYou've been denied, you're not getting in.\n\n781\n00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,587\n>> Yep.\n>> An implicit deny,\n\n782\n00:37:18,587 --> 00:37:21,020\nI didn't put Ronnie on the list.\n\n783\n00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,830\nBut, at some point Ronnie could be\nadded to the list by somebody else.\n\n784\n00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:27,420\n>> Yep, yep.\n>> Or he could be added to a group and\n\n785\n00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,190\nthat group has permissions\nover that resource.\n\n786\n00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:29,690\n>> Sure.\n>> And all of\n\n787\n00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,300\na sudden Ronnie does have access.\n\n788\n00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,530\nSo an implicit deny just says,\nyou don't have access but\n\n789\n00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:37,333\nyou might get access some other way and\nthat will be okay.\n\n790\n00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:39,281\n>> Yeah\n>> Where an explicate deny says\n\n791\n00:37:39,281 --> 00:37:39,933\n[SOUND] no.\n\n792\n00:37:39,933 --> 00:37:44,386\n>> Yup and it's about we talk a lot\nabout the least amount of administration\n\n793\n00:37:44,386 --> 00:37:49,277\neffort and implicit deny based systems\nby default make our assigning access and\n\n794\n00:37:49,277 --> 00:37:52,905\nstuff a little bit less of\nan administrative complexity.\n\n795\n00:37:52,905 --> 00:37:53,535\n>> Absolutely.\n\n796\n00:37:53,535 --> 00:37:56,795\n>> Because when you talk about explicit,\nyou're talking about manually defining who\n\n797\n00:37:56,795 --> 00:37:58,775\ndoes and\nwho doesn't have access to something.\n\n798\n00:37:58,775 --> 00:37:59,940\nVersus.\n\n799\n00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:04,580\nI can manage it a little bit more easier\nif I say well, just nobody has access.\n\n800\n00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,420\nAnd I don't have to go down there and\n\n801\n00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,230\njust completely define that\non a use by user basis.\n\n802\n00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,280\nNo, you don't have access.\n\n803\n00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,360\nNo, you don't have access.\n\n804\n00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,700\nA lot of redundancy there.\n\n805\n00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,250\n>> A lot easier to specify who does than\nto try to remember everybody that doesn't.\n\n806\n00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,986\nAnd so\nit's a lot easier to manage absolutely.\n\n807\n00:38:20,986 --> 00:38:22,470\nAnd it's a more secure way to do it.\n\n808\n00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:25,050\nI would rather have\nsomebody not get access and\n\n809\n00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:28,530\nthen have a problem, call Help Desk,\nor do whatever, and we fix it.\n\n810\n00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:31,190\nThan to just blank it,\ngive everybody access, and\n\n811\n00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,380\ngo, Oh crap, he wasn't supposed to\nhave access, so let me go fix that.\n\n812\n00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,924\nToo late,\nhe's already got access to it, right?\n\n813\n00:38:35,924 --> 00:38:38,428\n>> Yep.\n>> So it's much better to fail close,\n\n814\n00:38:38,428 --> 00:38:40,572\nif you will, that kind of concept.\n\n815\n00:38:40,572 --> 00:38:44,084\n>> Don't grant permissions or access when\nyou don't have your glasses on either.\n\n816\n00:38:44,084 --> 00:38:45,349\n>> [LAUGH] That's right, yeah.\n\n817\n00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:48,321\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Been there, done that.\n\n818\n00:38:48,321 --> 00:38:48,842\n>> Yeah.\n\n819\n00:38:48,842 --> 00:38:52,120\n>> Oh no, I can do it, I don't need to\nsee anything, I know this stuff by heart.\n\n820\n00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,840\n>> Yeah.\n\n821\n00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,190\nWes, you are now an enterprise\nlevel administrator.\n\n822\n00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,940\n>> I made Wes,\nWes had recently started with us and\n\n823\n00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,420\nhe had gotten to the point where\nwe gonna make him the main admin,\n\n824\n00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,480\ngive him the main admin\nrights on the network.\n\n825\n00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,840\nAnd I said yeah, you know what,\nI can take care of that.\n\n826\n00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,110\nAre you gonna use\na restricted group policy?\n\n827\n00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,738\nAnd I'll throw you into the main\nadmin group, no big deal.\n\n828\n00:39:09,738 --> 00:39:12,500\nAnd if mostly you guys\nare Windows familiar you remember\n\n829\n00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,760\nthat in that policy setting in a GPO,\nyou have two options.\n\n830\n00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,870\nOne that adds somebody to\nthe existing list, and\n\n831\n00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,540\nthe other one that is an explicit list.\n\n832\n00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,730\nAnd it will remove everybody\nthat you don't specify.\n\n833\n00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,400\nI used the wrong add button.\n\n834\n00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,080\n>> Oops.\n>> And so when we came in the next day,\n\n835\n00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,640\nWes was an admin.\n\n836\n00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,085\nHe was the only admin on the network.\n\n837\n00:39:31,085 --> 00:39:32,820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Our backups didn't run.\n\n838\n00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,600\n>> That's right.\n\n839\n00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,920\n>> None of the other admins\ncould log on that morning.\n\n840\n00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,620\nIt was not a good-\n>> The beach is that way.\n\n841\n00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,810\nLuckily not an RGE.\n\n842\n00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:42,348\nI don't know if you guys know,\nanybody know what an RGE is out there?\n\n843\n00:39:42,348 --> 00:39:43,830\nI'll give you a few minutes to see if\n\n844\n00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,300\nyou can figure that out while\nwe move to the next topic.\n\n845\n00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,148\n>> They are probably saying, did you\njust throw in another acronym at us?\n\n846\n00:39:48,148 --> 00:39:48,658\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n847\n00:39:48,658 --> 00:39:49,788\n>> It's an acronym that you don't need to\n\n848\n00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,544\nknow at all for the exams so-\n>> So we want you to know it.\n\n849\n00:39:51,544 --> 00:39:55,703\nAll right, so\nnext on our list is network separation, so\n\n850\n00:39:55,703 --> 00:40:01,265\nwe kinda hit this a little bit earlier\nwhen we talked about VLAN management.\n\n851\n00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:03,156\n>> That's right.\n>> I think we talked about it the other\n\n852\n00:40:03,156 --> 00:40:05,578\nday as some basic concepts as well,\ncuz we talked about.\n\n853\n00:40:05,578 --> 00:40:07,296\nYes.\n\n854\n00:40:07,296 --> 00:40:09,019\n>> Was one of our topics yesterday.\n\n855\n00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:13,569\n>> Yep and when it comes down to it, you\ncan isolate different computers based on\n\n856\n00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:18,189\na grouping of more frequent communication,\nnetwork separation can happen,\n\n857\n00:40:18,189 --> 00:40:22,739\nit can be based on physical links, can be\nbased on a switch that really when can\n\n858\n00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:27,221\nveer away from physical links and\nV line management, make it more logical.\n\n859\n00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:31,184\nTake it into layer three, where you're\ntalking about subnets, and subnets by\n\n860\n00:40:31,184 --> 00:40:35,383\nthemselves don't really provide security,\nbecause all we have to do is change an IP\n\n861\n00:40:35,383 --> 00:40:39,700\naddress, and now I'm on your network, but\nthey do help to assist in applying ACL's,\n\n862\n00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,842\nand defying different access control\nlists, or maybe different restrictions for\n\n863\n00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:47,924\na subnet where you have a group of servers\nthat are like your patent development and\n\n864\n00:40:47,924 --> 00:40:50,510\nstuff like that versus\njust normal work stations.\n\n865\n00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,440\n>> Exactly.\nBecause when we make that subnet,\n\n866\n00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,840\nnow we've got two different networks.\n\n867\n00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,100\nThat means I've got to put a router in\nbetween them to allow the communication to\n\n868\n00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,730\ngo on.\n\n869\n00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:00,740\nNow that I've got a router, I've got\na place to implement access control lists\n\n870\n00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,308\nand I can control that traffic.\n\n871\n00:41:02,308 --> 00:41:06,150\nAnd as it could just be to segregate\nout and make smaller contention and\n\n872\n00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,610\nbroadcast domains.\n\n873\n00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:09,360\nIt could be for security purposes.\n\n874\n00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:13,060\nLike I want to put my my servers on a\ndifferent subnet, they don't have to deal\n\n875\n00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,930\nwith the other traffic don't have the same\ncongestion or I've got more control over\n\n876\n00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,750\nwhich nodes are allowed to communicate\nwith some of those servers.\n\n877\n00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,700\nAnd it's my back end SQL servers.\n\n878\n00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,720\nThe databases that are hosting\nthe data from my website.\n\n879\n00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,890\nMy normal clients don't need to browse\ndirectly to those back end servers, right?\n\n880\n00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:31,540\nJust the web server need to be\nable to contact that database.\n\n881\n00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,240\nAnd a couple of admins that\nneed to connect to it.\n\n882\n00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:38,420\nSo, that gives me that chance to control\nthat access and keep that segregated out.\n\n883\n00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,296\nIt also means more difficult time for\nthe bad guys, right?\n\n884\n00:41:40,296 --> 00:41:43,784\nBecause now they get onto one subnet,\nnothing exciting to attack.\n\n885\n00:41:43,784 --> 00:41:46,352\nNow they gotta try to break\nover to another subnet,\n\n886\n00:41:46,352 --> 00:41:49,460\nget through another router,\nanother set of rules.\n\n887\n00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,660\nMore chances for\nus to detect the attack, right?\n\n888\n00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,270\nThey're gonna make more noise,\nset off intrusion detections or\n\n889\n00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:57,410\nintrusion prevention systems, log entries\nof the fact that they were there.\n\n890\n00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,935\nSo, again, it's another layer.\n\n891\n00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:02,360\nWe talked yesterday about\nlayers of security.\n\n892\n00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,530\n>> Defense and depth.\n\n893\n00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,650\n>> Exactly.\nIt's just another layer that we can\n\n894\n00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:08,850\nimplement that has a lot of good\nbenefits other than security\n\n895\n00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,130\n>> That's right, I mean one of the classic\n\n896\n00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:13,350\nnetworks separations that we talk\nabout are DMZs, perimeter networks.\n\n897\n00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:14,668\nWhy do we create a DMZ?\n\n898\n00:42:14,668 --> 00:42:17,620\nWell, we wanna give external access\nto our internal resources but\n\n899\n00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,840\nwe certainly don't want them\nhaving access to that SQL Server.\n\n900\n00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,370\nWe've got a web server in the DMZ and\nthat's the front-end.\n\n901\n00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:26,720\nAnd of course we want someone to be able,\nif we have e-commerce, we want someone to\n\n902\n00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:32,710\nbe able to access the web page or the\nforum where you can fill out information.\n\n903\n00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:36,420\nWe talked about remediation networks\nthrough network access protection.\n\n904\n00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,597\nYou don't meet the policy,\nyou don't meet the defined rule,\n\n905\n00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,400\nwell you don't have full network access.\n\n906\n00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,090\nAnd you get kicked off into a remediation\nnetwork, where maybe we have a WSUS\n\n907\n00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:50,080\nserver, maybe we've stored some\ninternal line of business.\n\n908\n00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,015\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n909\n00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:52,813\n[CROSSTALK] software,\nprogrammers, stuff like that.\n\n910\n00:42:52,813 --> 00:42:55,338\n>> And\nthat remediation network is a subnet.\n\n911\n00:42:55,338 --> 00:42:57,720\nSo, I can restrict your packets.\n\n912\n00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,700\nI set up filters that say your packets,\nyour IP address\n\n913\n00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,900\nis only allowed to communicate with nodes\nthat are on this particular subnet.\n\n914\n00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,100\nIf you try to communication with nodes\non any other subnet, you get dropped.\n\n915\n00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,120\nThose packets get dropped.\n\n916\n00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,166\nRight?\n>> That's right.\n\n917\n00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:11,540\n>> So\nthat's how we restrict you to that subnet.\n\n918\n00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,160\nIf we didn't have a subnet,\nwe couldn't very well restrict you.\n\n919\n00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:14,740\n>> That's right.\n\n920\n00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,360\nAll right, so that's network separation.\n\n921\n00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,750\nThen we've got log analysis,\nmy favorite thing to do.\n\n922\n00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,502\nNot.\n\n923\n00:43:22,502 --> 00:43:24,235\n[LAUGH]\n>> I was gonna say,\n\n924\n00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:26,367\ndid you hear the crickets out there?\n\n925\n00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:26,900\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, shoot.\n\n926\n00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,480\nBut somebody has to do it, right?\n\n927\n00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,000\nI mean, we know that logging is good.\n\n928\n00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,270\nWe have to log.\n\n929\n00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:36,860\nA lot of times it's for legal compliance,\nit's also because if we have an attack and\n\n930\n00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:41,380\nwe do end up figuring out who launched\nthe attack and we wanna try to prosecute.\n\n931\n00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:45,230\nOr if we wanna assist\nin the investigation.\n\n932\n00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:50,100\nWe call in the whomever may be\nthe authoritative in the particular case.\n\n933\n00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,330\nWhen they're doing their investigation,\n\n934\n00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:53,790\nthey can use those logs to\ntry to track back, you know,\n\n935\n00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:56,460\nwhere this person came from,\nhow they got in and things like that.\n\n936\n00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,529\nSo we need the log but\nif we don't look at the log files\n\n937\n00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,990\nthen you're really just wasting\ndisk space at that point.\n\n938\n00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:03,800\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n939\n00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,500\n>> I mean, what's the point of\nlogging all that information\n\n940\n00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,850\nif nobody's ever gonna go back and\nactually look at it.\n\n941\n00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,385\nNot the most fun job.\n\n942\n00:44:11,385 --> 00:44:14,810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There are a lot of third party tools\n\n943\n00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:17,610\nthat you can get that\nwill help you crunch it.\n\n944\n00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:23,020\nBecause these log files can get huge\ndepending on what level of logging\n\n945\n00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,820\nthat you're doing.\n\n946\n00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,950\nBut with the right tools-\n>> And with the right purposes too,\n\n947\n00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:28,740\nyou could do it for\nall different purposes.\n\n948\n00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,920\nYou know when you look at log analysis we\ncould be doing it as part of a disaster\n\n949\n00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,590\nrecovery policy to identify what are our\nmost critical systems in a situation where\n\n950\n00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:39,750\nour main site goes offline,\nwhich we'll talk about in another, and\n\n951\n00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:43,010\nhave talked about in other episodes,\nbut if our main site goes offline,\n\n952\n00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:46,000\nwe've gotta figure out what has to\nget back online within seconds,\n\n953\n00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,580\nmaybe within minutes, maybe within hours,\n\n954\n00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:52,610\nmaybe with these services we can\nstay 24 hours versus seven days.\n\n955\n00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:54,610\nAnd that's one of the things\nthat this helps out.\n\n956\n00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:56,240\nWhen you're doing risk assessment.\n\n957\n00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,100\n>> Right.\n>> We have to audit,\n\n958\n00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,510\nwe use audit logs to determine where\nare the risks within our networks and\n\n959\n00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:04,538\naccounting, I believe they also call\nit as well, auditing or accounting.\n\n960\n00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:08,345\nTracking those system-wide activities and\nmaking sure that we have accountability\n\n961\n00:45:08,345 --> 00:45:13,055\nfor different actions that happen along\nour network, whether it's resource access,\n\n962\n00:45:13,055 --> 00:45:16,065\nlogging in after hours,\nduring hours or what?\n\n963\n00:45:16,065 --> 00:45:19,416\n>> Absolutely, yeah exactly, it's not\njust from the outside or from that,\n\n964\n00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:21,235\nit's gonna help me against data leaks.\n\n965\n00:45:21,235 --> 00:45:21,816\n>> Sure.\n\n966\n00:45:21,816 --> 00:45:23,344\nSure.\n>> Internal threats and\n\n967\n00:45:23,344 --> 00:45:27,285\nthings like that cuz I notice someones\naccessing these documents at 12:30\n\n968\n00:45:27,285 --> 00:45:30,929\nat night when none of my normal employees\nthat are supposed to be accessing\n\n969\n00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:33,340\nthose documents are even in the building.\n\n970\n00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,070\nI can see that in the log file.\n\n971\n00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:39,843\nIf I didn't see the log file I would've\nnever known that somebody accessed those\n\n972\n00:45:39,843 --> 00:45:42,241\ndocuments at 12:30 at night, so.\n\n973\n00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:43,076\n>> Sure.\n\n974\n00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:45,490\n>> Again not the most fun thing to do.\n\n975\n00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:47,900\n>> Yep\n>> But somebody's got to do it.\n\n976\n00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,210\n>> And it might help, yeah that's right.\n\n977\n00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:51,260\n>> Hopefully it's not me.\n\n978\n00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,910\n>> And it might help you know for\n\n979\n00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:57,350\nmaking sure people are in compliance\nwith acceptable use policies.\n\n980\n00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:58,590\nWe've got a wireless network, and\n\n981\n00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:02,920\nmaybe we define our wireless network in\nanther IP range on a different subnet so\n\n982\n00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,740\nwe can identify when we look\nat those source IP addresses.\n\n983\n00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,910\nWell, hey this came from\na wireless network and\n\n984\n00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:10,290\nit came from the wireless\nnetwork at about midnight.\n\n985\n00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:13,050\nWell, why is somebody on my wireless\nnetwork at midnight when the whole\n\n986\n00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:14,630\nentire building is closed, you know?\n\n987\n00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:15,950\nAgain-\n>> Because you've got a really strong\n\n988\n00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:17,450\nsignal and it picks up really\nwell in the parking lot?\n\n989\n00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:18,835\n>> Don't tell them about my cantenna.\n\n990\n00:46:18,835 --> 00:46:19,490\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n991\n00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:21,005\n>> Don't tell them about my cantenna.\n\n992\n00:46:21,005 --> 00:46:21,930\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n993\n00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:25,730\nAll right, we got our log analysis and\n\n994\n00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:29,830\nthen we'll round it off with\nunified threat management.\n\n995\n00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:32,555\nAnd this is actually something\nI heard Ronny and Nate,\n\n996\n00:46:32,555 --> 00:46:36,670\nI was listening to the show earlier today,\nthat they were talking about.\n\n997\n00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:38,560\nWe've talked about all\nthese different techniques.\n\n998\n00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,110\nWe've got our firewalls, our anti-malware,\nour network intrusion detection systems.\n\n999\n00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:44,760\n>> That's right, Paul.\n\n1000\n00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,530\nYour URL filtering,\nyour content inspection.\n\n1001\n00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:50,760\nThe Pringles can is a perfect one, too.\n\n1002\n00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,780\n>> He caught the cantenna.\n\n1003\n00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,710\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n1004\n00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,050\nYou've got all these different tools.\n\n1005\n00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:56,330\nThe problem is, as a systems admin or\n\n1006\n00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:59,560\na network admin,\nthat's a lot of different tools to learn.\n\n1007\n00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,930\nA lot of different management interfaces.\n\n1008\n00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:05,230\nAnd most of them can be,\nthey can be relatively complex so it's so\n\n1009\n00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:07,700\nmany different things I've gotta learn.\n\n1010\n00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,810\nAnd the idea is that a unified\nmanagement brings it all together.\n\n1011\n00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:13,357\n>> That's right.\n>> Ties it up into one vendor's\n\n1012\n00:47:13,357 --> 00:47:18,051\nprovided management interface\nthat I have to learn.\n\n1013\n00:47:18,051 --> 00:47:21,440\nOne console that I can go in and\nI can work with all of that stuff.\n\n1014\n00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,900\nI can set firewall rules.\n\n1015\n00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,189\nI can look at my anti-malware and\n\n1016\n00:47:24,189 --> 00:47:26,775\nmy intrusion detection without\nhaving to open up separate tools.\n\n1017\n00:47:26,775 --> 00:47:27,438\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n1018\n00:47:27,438 --> 00:47:28,378\n>> That's the idea behind that.\n\n1019\n00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:28,878\n>> That's right.\n\n1020\n00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,700\nCentralized administration for\nyour security implementations,\n\n1021\n00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,070\none single interface.\n\n1022\n00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:37,030\nWe talked about centralized\nadministration, it tries to\n\n1023\n00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:41,210\nease the burden of complex, burden of\ncomplexity, I can't even say that.\n\n1024\n00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:43,656\nBut when we have 15 different\nproducts that we're looking at,\n\n1025\n00:47:43,656 --> 00:47:46,330\nit's not really convenient to have\nthem in 15 different locations-\n\n1026\n00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,640\n>> All of them.\n\n1027\n00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,030\n>> All of them have to be updated.\n\n1028\n00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:52,820\nThey have different passwords,\nusernames to get into them, manage them,\n\n1029\n00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:53,880\nthings like that.\n\n1030\n00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,628\nIt just adds to the complexity.\n\n1031\n00:47:54,628 --> 00:47:57,631\nAlthough I will say, that it sounds great,\n\n1032\n00:47:57,631 --> 00:48:02,338\nthere is a downside to the UTM's,\nthe unified threat management and\n\n1033\n00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:07,228\nthat is Bring it all into one that\ndoes become a single point of failure.\n\n1034\n00:48:07,228 --> 00:48:11,332\nSo if something happens to that\nunified threat management system,\n\n1035\n00:48:11,332 --> 00:48:14,350\nI didn't just lose my antivirus software.\n\n1036\n00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:18,673\nI also lost my anti-malware,\nmy URL filtering, my network [CROSSTALK],\n\n1037\n00:48:18,673 --> 00:48:19,801\nthings like that.\n\n1038\n00:48:19,801 --> 00:48:24,261\nIf that one vendor gets a vulnerability\nthat somebody discovers, everything,\n\n1039\n00:48:24,261 --> 00:48:27,220\nall of my security,\nis now in that one basket.\n\n1040\n00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,090\nYes.\n>> So\n\n1041\n00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:30,090\nthat is something that we\ndo have to be aware of.\n\n1042\n00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:33,140\nI could end up blowing a hole\nopen in my entire network\n\n1043\n00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:36,490\nif something goes wrong with that\nsystem or if that system goes down.\n\n1044\n00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,440\n>> And if somebody attacks that system now\nyou don't have 15 different locations.\n\n1045\n00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,080\nYou got a single point of attack there.\n\n1046\n00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,010\n>> They could compromise everything.\n\n1047\n00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:45,020\n>> Yeah, and bring down everything\nin your infrastructure.\n\n1048\n00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,380\n>> Exactly, so something to keep in mind.\n\n1049\n00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:50,810\nSo, just something we have to be aware of,\nif we are going to use one of those,\n\n1050\n00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:55,040\nweighing the benefits versus\nthe downsides there is.\n\n1051\n00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,530\nI really like the idea of having\na single management interface.\n\n1052\n00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:58,270\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I don't\n\n1053\n00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,560\nlike the idea of having that\nsingle point of failure.\n\n1054\n00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,260\n>> Mm-hm,.\n\n1055\n00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:02,910\n>> So which one do I go with, right?\n\n1056\n00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:06,170\nAnd that's something that has to be\ndecided on a per company basis, or\n\n1057\n00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:07,460\na per scenario basis.\n\n1058\n00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:11,870\n>> Yeah, and it just, again, it eases\nthat complexity of that administration.\n\n1059\n00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:15,415\nNow, SNMP's not so much for\nsecurity, but if you look at it,\n\n1060\n00:49:15,415 --> 00:49:17,965\nit's almost like SNMP is for\nmanagement, right?\n\n1061\n00:49:17,965 --> 00:49:21,525\nWe don't wanna go to 15 different servers,\n50 servers,\n\n1062\n00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:26,405\nall these different connectivity devices\nwithin our network, so what do we do?\n\n1063\n00:49:26,405 --> 00:49:30,365\nWe let them report back to a centralized\nlocation and then in that single location,\n\n1064\n00:49:30,365 --> 00:49:33,465\nan administrator can take care and\nmonitor the state of their devices.\n\n1065\n00:49:33,465 --> 00:49:35,380\nWell, it's kind of like that for\nyour security.\n\n1066\n00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:38,820\nYou've got that single point,\na reference point if you will, for\n\n1067\n00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,300\nall of your security infrastructure.\n\n1068\n00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,170\nOr, a good portion of your\nsecurity infrastructure.\n\n1069\n00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:44,320\n>> Exactly.\n\n1070\n00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,660\nWell, I'll tell you what,\nthat pretty much wraps it up for 1.2.\n\n1071\n00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:51,620\nUnless you've got anything else you\nthink we've missed or didn't cover?\n\n1072\n00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:52,700\nNo, good to go?\n\n1073\n00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,482\n>> I'm good to go.\n\n1074\n00:49:53,482 --> 00:49:54,780\n>> All right, well, we'll come back and\n\n1075\n00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,840\ntalk about that cantana\nin just a little bit.\n\n1076\n00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,950\nBut for now we are going to\ntake a quick little break.\n\n1077\n00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:02,073\nGive us a chance again to grab some\nrefreshments and we're gonna tinker around\n\n1078\n00:50:02,073 --> 00:50:04,554\nwith our mic's we seem to have\na little crackle going on here.\n\n1079\n00:50:04,554 --> 00:50:06,578\nHope that wasn't too bad on you guys,\n\n1080\n00:50:06,578 --> 00:50:10,706\nbut we will take a little break and we\nwill see you back here in a few for 1.5.\n\n1081\n00:50:10,706 --> 00:50:19,080\n[SOUND]\n>> All right.\n\n1082\n00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:22,895\nWelcome back everybody from our little\nbreak, and Mike's mental break there.\n\n1083\n00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:25,290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We have wrapped up topic 1.2.\n\n1084\n00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:31,080\nAnd we're gonna jump on over to topic 1.5,\nand we're not going exactly in order.\n\n1085\n00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:34,280\nWe try to pick an order that really\nmakes it a more logical sense.\n\n1086\n00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,530\nRather than follow directly along\nwith the object sometimes, so.\n\n1087\n00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:39,120\n>> And this is the official.\n\n1088\n00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,140\nLet's see, 1.5.\n\n1089\n00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:44,620\nGiven a scenario, troubleshoot security\nissues related to wireless networking.\n\n1090\n00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:47,440\n>> Wireless networking, security issues.\n\n1091\n00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,316\nYeah.\n>> There are none, come on.\n\n1092\n00:50:48,316 --> 00:50:49,389\n>> No, no.\n\n1093\n00:50:49,389 --> 00:50:50,170\n>> Really?\n\n1094\n00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:50,840\nDo we have trouble?\n\n1095\n00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,360\nBecause I use wireless everywhere.\n\n1096\n00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,360\n>> All the hot spots.\n\n1097\n00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:59,550\n>> All the open hot spots man,\nI do all my banking, everything.\n\n1098\n00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:02,580\n>> Where do you visit the hot spots,\nlet me know please.\n\n1099\n00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:03,830\n>> Let me know where\nI'm gonna go set up my.\n\n1100\n00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,550\n>> Protocol.\n>> We were just talking about snort and\n\n1101\n00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:08,670\na couple of other things there and\na little ethereal and\n\n1102\n00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:11,000\nwire short I guess nowadays.\n\n1103\n00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,390\nNo, seriously,\nin all seriousness I can't even talk.\n\n1104\n00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:19,110\nIn all seriousness, we do have some\nissues that we have to deal with,\n\n1105\n00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:21,550\nlike any other network\nwith wireless technology.\n\n1106\n00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:25,100\nBut wireless is inherently more difficult\nto secure because it is unbound.\n\n1107\n00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,160\nRight because it's as you say, radiating.\n\n1108\n00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,400\nIt's floating out there.\n\n1109\n00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,110\nWhereas with my normal Ethernet traffic,\nit's wrapped up inside a cable.\n\n1110\n00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:34,530\nAnd so I can protect the ports.\n\n1111\n00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:37,550\nI can try to prevent you from being\nable to access the network by\n\n1112\n00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:40,770\nnot putting ports in unsecured areas so\nthat you're going to have to figure out\n\n1113\n00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:44,610\na way to tap into those wires or\ncome across the network and attack me.\n\n1114\n00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:47,110\nWhereas with wireless,\nit's just out there.\n\n1115\n00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:47,610\n>> Yep.\n>> And\n\n1116\n00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:52,720\nit's difficult to control who's gaining\naccess to that wireless signal.\n\n1117\n00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,590\nSo we really have to worry about\nsecurity in our wireless networks.\n\n1118\n00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:57,620\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n1119\n00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,590\nAnd one of the things to keep in mind,\ntoo, is even if you don't have devices\n\n1120\n00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:03,820\ncurrently on your wireless network,\nwe still have information passing\n\n1121\n00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,997\nthrough that network that's typically not\naddressed to anyone network adaptor, but\n\n1122\n00:52:06,997 --> 00:52:09,450\nthe access points used\nto control management.\n\n1123\n00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:12,860\nAnd manage any devices that\nmight be on the network so\n\n1124\n00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:16,260\neven when you're not actively sending\ninformation there's information traversing\n\n1125\n00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:20,800\nthat radiated space if you will,\nfrom that wireless access point.\n\n1126\n00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,580\nWhen you think about it,\n\n1127\n00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:25,290\nall someone really has to do if you're not\nsecuring that traffic, is literally just\n\n1128\n00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:29,955\nsit outside of your, wherever your\nland is, wherever you're located.\n\n1129\n00:52:29,955 --> 00:52:30,570\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n1130\n00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:32,330\nall they gotta do is start\ncapturing information.\n\n1131\n00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:34,030\n>> Right.\n>> And if they capture enough information,\n\n1132\n00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:36,390\nthen that's where the stuff now,\nwe gotta start worrying about it.\n\n1133\n00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:37,770\n>> Yep, yep.\n\n1134\n00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:38,520\nSo what do we do about it?\n\n1135\n00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,143\nWell, we've got a few different protocols\nthat we can use to try to secure our\n\n1136\n00:52:42,143 --> 00:52:45,433\nwireless network and one of the original\nones that the IEEE came up with\n\n1137\n00:52:45,433 --> 00:52:48,919\nway back in the 802.11 days,\nI mean before anything else, right?\n\n1138\n00:52:48,919 --> 00:52:52,735\nJust straight up 802.11, what, 111\nmegabits per second or something, anyway.\n\n1139\n00:52:52,735 --> 00:52:55,732\n>> Yes, September of 1999.\n\n1140\n00:52:55,732 --> 00:52:57,983\n>> 1999, look at this trivia master here,\nI like it.\n\n1141\n00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:00,071\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It was WEP, or\n\n1142\n00:53:00,071 --> 00:53:05,220\nWired Equivalent Privacy, and\nthat was a bulletproof system wasn't it?\n\n1143\n00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,232\n>> Yes, it wasn't.\n\n1144\n00:53:06,232 --> 00:53:12,053\nWhen the IEEE originally introduced\nwhat we now call legacy 802.11.\n\n1145\n00:53:12,053 --> 00:53:15,456\nThey needed a way,\na temporary solution that would just,\n\n1146\n00:53:15,456 --> 00:53:20,526\nall that radiated information, unbounded,\nthe signals being sent out, they wanted\n\n1147\n00:53:20,526 --> 00:53:24,985\na temporary solution to try to close\noff what we call casual eavesdropping.\n\n1148\n00:53:24,985 --> 00:53:27,598\n>> So that somebody couldn't\njust walk by your network and\n\n1149\n00:53:27,598 --> 00:53:29,220\nsee everything that's going on.\n\n1150\n00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:30,905\nBut when it comes down to it.\n\n1151\n00:53:30,905 --> 00:53:34,050\nWEP stands for Wired Equivalent Privacy.\n\n1152\n00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,290\nAnd even when we talk about wire taps.\n\n1153\n00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:39,500\nUnless you're really employing\nsome kind of encryption.\n\n1154\n00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,750\nYour wired networks aren't\nthat secure anyway.\n\n1155\n00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:44,040\n>> Exactly.\nIf I'm standing next to a port,\n\n1156\n00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,180\nI can't read your data.\n\n1157\n00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,430\nBut if I plug a cable into your port,\nI can read your data.\n\n1158\n00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:51,670\nIf I'm standing in your wireless zone and\nyou've got WEP turned on,\n\n1159\n00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:52,680\nI can't read your data.\n\n1160\n00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,590\nIf I connect to your access point,\nnow I can read your data.\n\n1161\n00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:58,610\nIt wasn't meant to be this bullet proof,\nend all security.\n\n1162\n00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:04,430\nIt was just meant, as you said, that the\ncasual passer-by or making it too easy.\n\n1163\n00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:05,610\nIt's like locking your front door.\n\n1164\n00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,330\nI mean if somebody wants\ninto your front door,\n\n1165\n00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:10,210\nthey're going to get in through that\nlock on your front door, right?\n\n1166\n00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:11,720\nBut they'd have to do some work to do it.\n\n1167\n00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,722\nAnd that's what WEP gave us.\n\n1168\n00:54:12,722 --> 00:54:15,464\nIt gave us a little bit of protection so\n\n1169\n00:54:15,464 --> 00:54:20,950\nthat you had to take some extra steps in\norder to be able to access that data.\n\n1170\n00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:25,750\n>> And it was later found out that\nif you look at the WEP structure,\n\n1171\n00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:28,540\nit's surrounded by weakness.\n\n1172\n00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,220\nOne of the main things that we talk about\nis just the fact that the key never\n\n1173\n00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,230\nchanges that we use.\n\n1174\n00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:36,080\nAnd it gives hackers or attackers if you\nwill all the time they need that if they\n\n1175\n00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:40,200\ncan capture information that they can try\nto reverse engineer this information.\n\n1176\n00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,190\nIt also uses a very week RC4 stream\ncipher which was later broken,\n\n1177\n00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:48,385\nand determined to not to be the best\ntype of cypher to run this through.\n\n1178\n00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,080\nAnd then you have other things.\n\n1179\n00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:55,050\nWith encryption,\nwe talk about if you use the same key\n\n1180\n00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:59,370\nto encrypt the same data, we'll have\nthe same like output, the results.\n\n1181\n00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:03,070\nThey also add extra information in there\nthat tries to make everything unique.\n\n1182\n00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:06,350\nWell that little bit of extra information\nis very susceptible to attack, too.\n\n1183\n00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:09,240\nLiterally it's surrounded by problems.\n\n1184\n00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,310\n>> Yeah it is.\n\n1185\n00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:13,280\nAnd it's one of those things, kind of like\nsome of the other stuff we looked at.\n\n1186\n00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,760\nWay back when security\nwas not a huge concern.\n\n1187\n00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,360\nRight?\n\n1188\n00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:20,350\nComputers were not as\npowerful as they are.\n\n1189\n00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,307\nAs they became over the years.\n\n1190\n00:55:22,307 --> 00:55:25,531\nAnd so, as our technology got better and\nbetter, they used a 64-bit,\n\n1191\n00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:27,560\na 128-bit, or a 256-bit key length.\n\n1192\n00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,000\nAlthough that's not quite true,\n\n1193\n00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,700\nbecause it has some parody information\nusing up some of those bits, so.\n\n1194\n00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:40,850\nBut back then, a 128-bit key,\na 64-bit key, it was relatively strong.\n\n1195\n00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:41,500\n>> Sure.\n\n1196\n00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,895\n>> Not so much any more, right.\n\n1197\n00:55:42,895 --> 00:55:46,340\nSo, it served its purpose\nwhen wireless first came out.\n\n1198\n00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:50,376\nBut it wasn't long before we\nrealized that it was not very good,\n\n1199\n00:55:50,376 --> 00:55:55,112\nit wasn't worth taking a chance of\nputting my corporate data on a network.\n\n1200\n00:55:55,112 --> 00:55:57,840\nYou really didn't see a lot of sales\nof wireless in corporate offices.\n\n1201\n00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:01,680\nHome users were all about it because\nit was convenient and things like that.\n\n1202\n00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,320\n>> Yep.\nBut you didn't see a huge implementation\n\n1203\n00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:07,876\nin the business environment at\nfirst because of the weaknesses or\n\n1204\n00:56:07,876 --> 00:56:10,668\nthe lack of the ability to\nreally secure that data.\n\n1205\n00:56:10,668 --> 00:56:13,528\n>> Yeah, and I believe it's\nsomewhere around 2002 or 2003ish,\n\n1206\n00:56:13,528 --> 00:56:16,120\nright before the next protocol\nthat we're going to talk about.\n\n1207\n00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,970\nThere's proof of concept that said, hey,\nwe can break this inside of two minutes.\n\n1208\n00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:19,900\n>> Right.\n\n1209\n00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,340\n>> And really when it comes to web.\n\n1210\n00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,070\nThe hardest part I believe.\n\n1211\n00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:26,510\nAnd I don't understand the individual\nbits within the packets or anything.\n\n1212\n00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:28,990\nBut the hardest part is\njust gathering the data.\n\n1213\n00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:33,295\n>> Yeah I mean there's some really great\nprograms you could go out there and get\n\n1214\n00:56:33,295 --> 00:56:37,625\nit, and if you capture enough packets the\ninitialization factor becomes predictable.\n\n1215\n00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:38,455\n>> Yep the IV's, yep.\n\n1216\n00:56:38,455 --> 00:56:42,935\n>> If I see enough of the packets come\nalong, I can figure out what the next\n\n1217\n00:56:42,935 --> 00:56:47,075\ninitialization factor is going to be,\nso I just need to trigger some data.\n\n1218\n00:56:47,075 --> 00:56:50,495\nWait for a legitimate user to come along,\nand then just start capturing that data\n\n1219\n00:56:50,495 --> 00:56:55,590\nwith some wireless sniffer, or trigger\nthat access point to spit out data.\n\n1220\n00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:56,550\n>> Right, that's right.\n\n1221\n00:56:56,550 --> 00:57:00,470\n>> Take like, make it like throw a bunch\nof data and, I can use that to try to\n\n1222\n00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:04,760\nfigure out that initial, next-\n>> initialization factor, yep.\n\n1223\n00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,480\n>> Tongue tied today!\n\n1224\n00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,510\n>> Yeah, and you can capture\nthe information on a very, busy network,\n\n1225\n00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,890\nso actually makes it easier for\nthe hackers.\n\n1226\n00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:16,780\nThe more information that you have\ngoing across the web based network,\n\n1227\n00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,380\nthe easier it is to gather the data.\n\n1228\n00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:22,310\nYou start modifying packets, or\nframes I guess I should say, and in\n\n1229\n00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:27,740\nthe underline when your wireless adapters\nbuild those wireless networks, that\n\n1230\n00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:31,240\nlist of wireless networks, it's setting\nwhat's known as a station AP probe.\n\n1231\n00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,120\nAnd like Mike was saying,\nIf you can modify that,\n\n1232\n00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:36,320\nyou can just flood that wireless\naccess point with all of those.\n\n1233\n00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,940\nIt's going to keep returning information\nand you can collect the information a lot\n\n1234\n00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:43,700\nquicker due to the fact that just some\nof these extra things that they add to\n\n1235\n00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:47,830\nencryption in web specifically\nare very small in their bit length.\n\n1236\n00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:49,760\nIt doesn't really take\ntoo many combinations.\n\n1237\n00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,430\nI think it's a 24 bit length\ninitialization vector.\n\n1238\n00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:53,750\nAnd that's 16777216 possibilities.\n\n1239\n00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:56,820\n>> Which is not a lot\nwith today's computers.\n\n1240\n00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:59,560\n>> Nothing.\nIf you were to tell somebody 24 bit\n\n1241\n00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,350\nencryption they'd laugh at you.\n\n1242\n00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:02,320\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n1243\n00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:06,720\nSo, web was good, for what it was used for\nin that way back in the day.\n\n1244\n00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,260\nBut definitely not anything\nwe want to use now.\n\n1245\n00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:14,070\nIt is config, considered depreciated\nbecause of those vulnerabilities and\n\n1246\n00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:15,960\nit's not recommended that they use it.\n\n1247\n00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,450\nNow, I will say, and\n\n1248\n00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:21,902\nI've told other people this, if that's\nall you have goodbye new access point.\n\n1249\n00:58:21,902 --> 00:58:23,630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] You know if that's all you\n\n1250\n00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:25,070\nhave, turn it on, right?\n\n1251\n00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:28,860\nI mean I have a really crappy lock on my\nkitchen, I mean you can take a butter\n\n1252\n00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,690\nknife and stick it up in there and\njimmy that little lock open.\n\n1253\n00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:33,110\n>> Yep.\n>> That doesn't mean I leave the window\n\n1254\n00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:33,920\nunlocked all the time.\n\n1255\n00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,550\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n1256\n00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:35,370\nI still lock it.\n\n1257\n00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:38,240\nI mean hopefully I'll hear\nsomebody coming through.\n\n1258\n00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:43,130\nYou know that kind of thing, so if it's\nall I have, I'm going to turn it on.\n\n1259\n00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:47,110\nBut in the end we shouldn't be\nrunning equipment that's all I have.\n\n1260\n00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:48,820\nWe should have upgraded\nour equipment by now.\n\n1261\n00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:52,730\nAnd when we upgrade we're going\nto get a couple new options.\n\n1262\n00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:54,040\nWPA and WPA2.\n\n1263\n00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:58,460\nSo tell us a little A little\nbit about good old WPA.\n\n1264\n00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:00,970\n>> Well WPA this is\nWi-Fi protected access.\n\n1265\n00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,490\nAnd this was released in 2003.\n\n1266\n00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:10,900\nNot too long, believe it or not, after\nthey had that web was no longer secure.\n\n1267\n00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:14,560\nWell a consortium of wireless\nmanufacturers that also works with\n\n1268\n00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,990\nthe IEEE, who is the Institute for\nElectrical and\n\n1269\n00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:21,700\nElectronic Engineers who helps to\nrelease these specified standards.\n\n1270\n00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:24,860\nWell they went to the IEEE and they said\nhey guys we really need something now\n\n1271\n00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:28,550\nwe can't wait much longer, well the IEEE\nwas working on another protocol that we'll\n\n1272\n00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:31,830\ntalk about and they said well we don't\nhave it finalized but we can give you\n\n1273\n00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:34,653\nwhat we have as a temporary in between\n>> Right\n\n1274\n00:59:34,653 --> 00:59:35,610\n>> between WEP and\n\n1275\n00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:37,400\nwhat would later be released.\n\n1276\n00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:37,950\n>> Exactly.\n\n1277\n00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:41,790\nI mean the IEEE, it's a consortium, right,\nas you said, and they have to go through\n\n1278\n00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:46,170\na lengthy procedure to develop these\nstandards, test them thoroughly,\n\n1279\n00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:49,710\nget a unanimous, I mean I comprise them to\nNATO, everybody's got to agree on them.\n\n1280\n00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:50,630\n>> That's right.\n\n1281\n00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,960\n>> Before they can implement it,\nbut these companies are like.\n\n1282\n00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,800\nWe're not selling any wireless stuff.\n\n1283\n00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,390\n>> Right.\n>> You know,\n\n1284\n00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:56,540\nI want to be able to sell this product.\n\n1285\n00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:58,810\nWe need something to secure this data now.\n\n1286\n00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:02,140\nWe can't wait for\nyou to finish developing your standard.\n\n1287\n01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,600\nSo as you said,\nthey kind of gave them a little bit of,\n\n1288\n01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,400\nhere's what we got right now,\nlet's go with it.\n\n1289\n01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,530\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n1290\n01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:12,060\nYou know, and then later, the full set of\nfeatures would be released and finally\n\n1291\n01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:16,665\nStandardized under what, since the Wi-Fi\nAlliance had already marketed under WPA,\n\n1292\n01:00:16,665 --> 01:00:21,070\nWi-Fi Protected Access,\nthe IEEE finishes the standard in 2004.\n\n1293\n01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:22,890\nI think it was June 24th, 2004.\n\n1294\n01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:26,600\nAnd now we have the full set of features\nthat's released to the market as\n\n1295\n01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,280\nthe 802.11i\n>> the 11i exactly\n\n1296\n01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,120\n>> Yeh, and so the Wi-Fi Alliance says,\n\n1297\n01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:34,550\nwell you know, we've already marketed WPA,\nso we'll just call this WPA2, but\n\n1298\n01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:38,420\nfor the exam remember 802.11I and\nWPA2 are really one and the same.\n\n1299\n01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:39,820\n>> Are the same thing.\n\n1300\n01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:43,770\nWPA2 is basically the commercial name for\nit.\n\n1301\n01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:46,590\n802.11I is the official standard if you're\ngoing to go look it up on the IEEE.\n\n1302\n01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:49,500\n>> Like we talk in the A plus episodes\nwhen we say the difference between fire\n\n1303\n01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,232\nwire and I triple E 1394.\n\n1304\n01:00:51,232 --> 01:00:52,455\n[CROSSTALK] Sony has eye link, but\n\n1305\n01:00:52,455 --> 01:00:55,467\nwhen you look at it it's It's really using\nthe same set of standards it's just one\n\n1306\n01:00:55,467 --> 01:00:57,535\nis a marketing name versus\nwhat is in the public domain.\n\n1307\n01:00:57,535 --> 01:00:58,081\n>> Right.\n\n1308\n01:00:58,081 --> 01:01:00,150\n>> Kind of for a vendor neutrality.\n\n1309\n01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:02,790\n>> Exactly.\n>> All vendors can adhere to the standard\n\n1310\n01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:05,900\nand we have interoperability\nbetween our devices.\n\n1311\n01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:09,660\n>> So what they did with the WPA\nis is still has wep in there but\n\n1312\n01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:12,710\nit combined wep with\nsomething called TKIP.\n\n1313\n01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,326\nOr temporal key integrity protocol, TKIP.\n\n1314\n01:01:15,326 --> 01:01:19,740\nAnd they're going to use those in\nconjunction to strengthen or to kind of\n\n1315\n01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:24,030\nprotect the weaknesses that we had in WEP,\nto protect that initialization vector to\n\n1316\n01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:29,950\nmake that key a little bit longer so\nthat it was a little more secure.\n\n1317\n01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:35,640\nAnd when WPA comes along,\nthat's one of the things that it was,\n\n1318\n01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:38,920\nit implements is that temporal\nkey integrity protocol.\n\n1319\n01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,830\nAnother thing that they did too,\nwhen we talk about those IDs or\n\n1320\n01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:44,490\nthe initial Initialization\nvectors in WEP they were 24 bits.\n\n1321\n01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:46,850\nAnd we said very susceptible to attack and\nstuff.\n\n1322\n01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:51,400\nWell, they expanded that to the same\nbit link we have for Mac addresses,\n\n1323\n01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,280\n48 bits, and\n\n1324\n01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:55,670\nthey also put some other stuff on the end\nof it like their integrity check values.\n\n1325\n01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:59,780\nIn the earlier WEP, it was CRC-32,\nvery quick process that could be spoofed.\n\n1326\n01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:01,840\n>> RIght, yeah.\n>> You could take that information, and\n\n1327\n01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,600\nyou could say, yeah I'm go telling\nto you what value you should find.\n\n1328\n01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:08,650\nBut they use something called MAC, Message\nAuthentication Code, which you guys will\n\n1329\n01:02:08,650 --> 01:02:13,000\nlearn about in CISSP and\nsome of those other higher end security\n\n1330\n01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,050\nclasses that we teach, but it doesn't\nallow manipulation of those packets.\n\n1331\n01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:20,300\nAnd every single frame, and I know I'm\nsaying packets, but every single frame\n\n1332\n01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:23,930\nthat comes across that wireless access\npoint has to have a unique encryption key.\n\n1333\n01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:27,430\n>> Exactly, and that's where TKIP is\nthrown in, and TKIP is causing that\n\n1334\n01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:31,020\nkey change where WEP was using\nthat same key over and over again.\n\n1335\n01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:32,600\nTKIP was changing them up like D said,\n\n1336\n01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,840\nalmost with every frame\nthat was coming along.\n\n1337\n01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:35,560\n>> That's right.\n\n1338\n01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:39,650\nThe theory is that this\nTemporal Key Integrity Protocol,\n\n1339\n01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:43,580\nwhatever the encryption key is, it's not\ngoing to last long enough for the hackers\n\n1340\n01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:46,290\nto gain some kind of advantage over it\nwhere they can reverse engineer it.\n\n1341\n01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:49,000\n>> Right, by the time you broke it and\nfigure out what key I am using.\n\n1342\n01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,940\nI'm not using that key anymore,\nI've switched keys.\n\n1343\n01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:52,290\nI'm using something else.\n\n1344\n01:02:52,290 --> 01:02:53,150\n>> If you don't mind,\n\n1345\n01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:56,390\nI noticed we have another in here\nthat is a little bit out of order.\n\n1346\n01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:57,270\nIt was LEAP.\n\n1347\n01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:00,180\nAnd that was the lightweight\nextensible authentication protocol.\n\n1348\n01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:03,110\nAnd we're going to talk about EAP\ncoming up, but I'd kind of like to just\n\n1349\n01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:06,550\nthrow this one in here, because it\nkind of came out between WEP, and\n\n1350\n01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:11,150\nthen waiting for WPA, before we had\nthis next greatest thing, if you will.\n\n1351\n01:03:11,150 --> 01:03:12,850\nAnd, Cisco released it and\n\n1352\n01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:15,920\nit uses multiple web keys and\ntheir dynamic web if you will.\n\n1353\n01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,340\nSo that you're using multiple keys.\n\n1354\n01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:23,340\nAnd it was, it really, I don't believe\nthat you really should be used today.\n\n1355\n01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:24,630\nWe'll talk about another one coming up.\n\n1356\n01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:25,930\n>> Right.\n>> But it was kind of like the bridge\n\n1357\n01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:27,160\nbetween web.\n\n1358\n01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,120\nThat's right.\n\n1359\n01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:32,230\nAnd then WPA came out with TKEP and\nthat's what we move to.\n\n1360\n01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:34,060\n>> Exactly, and Leap was proprietary.\n\n1361\n01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:40,280\nWith Cisco, you paid them if you\nwanted to use it, type thing.\n\n1362\n01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,170\n>> Yep.\n>> So then,\n\n1363\n01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:45,170\nWEP kind of satisfied our needs for\nbeing able to secure our wireless network\n\n1364\n01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:48,690\na little bit better until\nthe IEEE finished their standard.\n\n1365\n01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:52,130\nAs we said a minute ago,\ntheir standard is the 802.11i.\n\n1366\n01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:56,393\nWe call it WPA2 just for ease and\nfor marketing reasons, and\n\n1367\n01:03:56,393 --> 01:03:58,573\nit brought along TKIP as well.\n\n1368\n01:03:58,573 --> 01:04:01,358\nDropped out the web encryption type stuff,\n\n1369\n01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:04,829\nbrought in AES with my\nadvanced encryption standard.\n\n1370\n01:04:04,829 --> 01:04:07,923\nIt is a much more robust\nencryption method.\n\n1371\n01:04:07,923 --> 01:04:10,945\nIn fact,\nrecently it was used as one of our U.S.\n\n1372\n01:04:10,945 --> 01:04:14,358\nGovernment as one of their standards for\nencryption.\n\n1373\n01:04:14,358 --> 01:04:19,965\n>> Definitely, it's endorsed for\nall levels of classified information and\n\n1374\n01:04:19,965 --> 01:04:24,330\nthat's something you can\ndefinitely check on the CISSP.\n\n1375\n01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:27,710\nThey talk about what classifications\nof information, but top secret and\n\n1376\n01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:30,680\nAAS is what we pretty much have today and\n\n1377\n01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:34,090\nthey got away from using\nthat earlier stream cipher.\n\n1378\n01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:37,260\nYou know Ron, rivest code,\nrivest code if you will, four.\n\n1379\n01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:40,820\nStill used, again,\nthat weak stream cipher so\n\n1380\n01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:44,960\nit was also considered\na weaker implementation.\n\n1381\n01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:50,170\n>> So good ol WPA2 again 128 bit\nencryption keys with those guys as well.\n\n1382\n01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:53,060\n>> And that's billion,\nbillion, billion combinations.\n\n1383\n01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:54,390\nBillion times a billion times a billion.\n\n1384\n01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,760\n>> Yep exactly.\nA little bit harder to predict.\n\n1385\n01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,090\nA little bit harder to predict.\n\n1386\n01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:58,330\n>> Yes.\n>> But\n\n1387\n01:04:58,330 --> 01:05:01,640\nit's one of those things we always\nsay it's a matter of time, right?\n\n1388\n01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:05,870\nSure I mean as my computers become\nmore powerful, you know my phones that\n\n1389\n01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:10,540\nare coming out with quad cores in them,\nthey can riffle through a billion\n\n1390\n01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:14,430\ntires in a matter of minutes, so\nit is a constant cat and mouse struggle.\n\n1391\n01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:18,360\nWe're making it stronger, devices\nare getting better at breaking it or\n\n1392\n01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,890\nhas the processing power and\ncapabilities to break things like that.\n\n1393\n01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,721\nSo, we make it stronger.\n\n1394\n01:05:23,721 --> 01:05:25,380\n>> Definitely.\n\n1395\n01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:26,180\n>> So we've got WPA2.\n\n1396\n01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:30,750\nThen we've got something called EAP or\nmy extensible authentication protocol.\n\n1397\n01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:33,680\nAnd this is kind of a confusing one-\n>> It really is.\n\n1398\n01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,180\n>> At times, right?\nBecause it's not.\n\n1399\n01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:37,690\nIt's not its own authentication protocol.\n\n1400\n01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:38,310\n>> No, it's not.\n\n1401\n01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:39,730\n>> Really, it's a framework.\n\n1402\n01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:40,370\n>> That's right.\n\n1403\n01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:42,490\n>> And you can tell us about that, right?\n\n1404\n01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:47,570\n>> Yeah, EAP is, when you look at\nthe earlier way that you would do,\n\n1405\n01:05:47,570 --> 01:05:50,460\nfor instance authentication\non point-to-point links and\n\n1406\n01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:54,670\nwireless communications, we could use,\nwhat was it called, PPP.\n\n1407\n01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:57,590\nPoint to point protocol and\nencrypt those passwords.\n\n1408\n01:05:57,590 --> 01:06:00,110\nBut the problem with it at the time,\n\n1409\n01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:04,020\nwe only had a certain set\nof authentication methods.\n\n1410\n01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:06,810\nSo you couldn't, and\nI hate to put the definition,\n\n1411\n01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:09,880\nextend it past what was\navailable at the time.\n\n1412\n01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,210\nSo what they did is they said you know\nwhat, let's take the functionality and\n\n1413\n01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:15,080\nthe features of PPP, and like you said,\nlet's put it in a framework.\n\n1414\n01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:18,790\nWe'll still get the functionality but\nthe framework's not really going to define\n\n1415\n01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:21,078\nwhat authentication method\nyou're going to use.\n\n1416\n01:06:21,078 --> 01:06:22,590\nWe're going to turn, I say we but\n\n1417\n01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:26,070\nit's going to be the brilliant minds out\nthere in the engineers definitely not Wes,\n\n1418\n01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:30,810\nbut they're going to Implement\nnow what we call EAP methods.\n\n1419\n01:06:30,810 --> 01:06:33,200\nAnd these EAP methods are very modular,\nand\n\n1420\n01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,020\nthey also include ones,\nwell that just haven't been invented yet.\n\n1421\n01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:38,240\n>> Right, exactly that's\nthe really cool thing about it.\n\n1422\n01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:42,740\nIt's extensible, so it works with a whole\nbunch of Kern authentication methods, but\n\n1423\n01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:45,500\nit's perfectly capable of working\nwith authentication methods that we\n\n1424\n01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,660\ndevelop in the future.\n\n1425\n01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:50,170\nIf we follow that framework,\nwe can create stronger dedication methods.\n\n1426\n01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:53,990\nStay within that framework and everything\nstill functions and works together.\n\n1427\n01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:57,580\nIt allows that interoperability between\nsystems where as long as they follow that\n\n1428\n01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:01,060\nframework, they'll be able to\nnegotiate that security and\n\n1429\n01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:03,230\ntake care of that\nauthentication process so\n\n1430\n01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:05,730\nagain think of it more like\na framework than an actual protocol.\n\n1431\n01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:11,100\nYou'll see it listed a lot like EAPTLS or\nEAPMS Chap and\n\n1432\n01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:15,420\nthings like this and that's because we're\ntaking those existing protocols and we're\n\n1433\n01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:19,060\nwrapping them up inside that framework or\ncombining them with that EAP framework.\n\n1434\n01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:21,930\n>> And I believe one of the most common,\nwell you've already mentioned\n\n1435\n01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:25,290\none of the most common, is the EAPTLS for\nsmart card authentication,\n\n1436\n01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:29,060\ntoken based certificate authentication,\nand another one of the most\n\n1437\n01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:33,300\nprobably one of the most common right now,\nis EAP MS Chat version two.\n\n1438\n01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:37,750\nAnd we'll talk in other episodes about\nhow MS Chat isn't really secure.\n\n1439\n01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:41,160\nBut today we use MS Chat version two and\nthey combine it with the EAP.\n\n1440\n01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,610\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n1441\n01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:46,450\nThat's the good old EAP again not actual\nprotocol, more like a frame work for\n\n1442\n01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:47,760\nauthentication methods.\n\n1443\n01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,520\nAnd then we got PEAP.\n\n1444\n01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,090\nWhich I just like the name.\n\n1445\n01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:52,020\n>> PEAP.\n\n1446\n01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:55,360\n>> But that's my Protected\nExtensible Authentication Protocol.\n\n1447\n01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:57,350\nAnd it's an open standard implementation.\n\n1448\n01:07:57,350 --> 01:07:59,040\nSimilar to what you're saying about LEAP.\n\n1449\n01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,200\nLEAP being a proprietary with Cisco.\n\n1450\n01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:01,850\n>> That's right.\n\n1451\n01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:02,410\n>> All right.\n>> Yep,\n\n1452\n01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:04,800\nand peep was kind of like a partner.\n\n1453\n01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:08,010\nYou see a lot of these standards that\nwe've talked about over the years,\n\n1454\n01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:10,100\nlike we talked about ethernet, right?\n\n1455\n01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,670\nDEC, Digital Equipment Corporations,\nIntel and Xerox.\n\n1456\n01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:15,250\nWe have a lot of same thing\nwith a lot of these protocols,\n\n1457\n01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:18,440\nthere's a collaborative effort to come up\nwith some things a little bit more secure.\n\n1458\n01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:22,750\nSo this was kind of like a coalition\nbetween Cisco, Microsoft, and\n\n1459\n01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:27,000\nthen those geniuses out there at\nRSA Security all got together and\n\n1460\n01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,020\nsays hey, EAP did have one limitation.\n\n1461\n01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:33,680\nAnd one of the things that it was\nexpecting was to have some kind of\n\n1462\n01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,420\nphysical wired security.\n\n1463\n01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:37,550\nSo, that was kind of\nwhat it expected to have.\n\n1464\n01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:39,850\nAnd well, that's not always the case.\n\n1465\n01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:43,310\n>> That initial negotiation\nwas kind of left open.\n\n1466\n01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:44,270\n>> Yeah.\nWide open.\n\n1467\n01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:45,310\n>> Yes, yep.\n\n1468\n01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:48,630\n>> So what these guys did,\nCisco, again, Microsoft and\n\n1469\n01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:49,920\nthen RSA is they said, you know what?\n\n1470\n01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,915\nWe're going to use EAPTLS\n>> And\n\n1471\n01:08:51,915 --> 01:08:56,980\nwe're going to use TLS to exchange and\nset up this encrypted tunnel.\n\n1472\n01:08:56,980 --> 01:08:59,470\nSo the tunnel itself is like\nour secure line, right?\n\n1473\n01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:05,200\nAnd in that secure line, now we can\nimplement or encrypt that user password,\n\n1474\n01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:09,330\nand we can send that authentication\nover an encrypted tunnel.\n\n1475\n01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:12,850\nSo now you've got more like that layered\ndefense system that you were saying.\n\n1476\n01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:13,440\n>> Right.\n>> And\n\n1477\n01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:17,570\nnow we have a way to establish a secure\ncommunication before we're even\n\n1478\n01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:18,350\nauthenticating.\n\n1479\n01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:21,300\nAnd that's really what Pete protected,\nEAP does.\n\n1480\n01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:25,160\nNow I say Cisco, Microsoft, and RSA.\n\n1481\n01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:29,040\nThey were on the forefronts of\ndeveloping Peep version zero,\n\n1482\n01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,590\nI think is what it's called.\n\n1483\n01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:34,530\nIn XP is where it was implemented and\nMicrosoft doesn't call it by a version\n\n1484\n01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:37,250\nnumber because they've only supported\none and they just call theirs Peap.\n\n1485\n01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:37,810\n>> Right.\n\n1486\n01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:40,850\n>> But it's really Peap version zero.\n\n1487\n01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:44,500\nCisco went farther with this and\nMicrosoft kind of left it behind, but\n\n1488\n01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,630\nCisco went farther with it, and\nthey have Peap version two.\n\n1489\n01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:48,570\nNo, version one.\n\n1490\n01:09:48,570 --> 01:09:49,420\n>> Okay.\n>> And\n\n1491\n01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:54,600\nthat's not really supported in\nWindows if you will, but Peap is.\n\n1492\n01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:59,590\nSo that's what we have there with those\ndifferent versions of that protocol.\n\n1493\n01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:03,398\nVersion zero or version one but like I\nsaid in Windows they just call it p.\n\n1494\n01:10:03,398 --> 01:10:05,200\n>> [LAUGH] Just p.\n\n1495\n01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:05,865\nJust p.\n>> Just p.\n\n1496\n01:10:05,865 --> 01:10:07,145\nI don't want to here\nanother peep out of you.\n\n1497\n01:10:07,145 --> 01:10:08,225\n>> That's right.\n\n1498\n01:10:08,225 --> 01:10:09,715\n>> All right let's see.\n\n1499\n01:10:09,715 --> 01:10:13,079\nWhy don't we go ahead and,\nwe got tkip listed as a [INAUDIBLE] and\n\n1500\n01:10:13,079 --> 01:10:14,433\nI've got a lot of notes.\n\n1501\n01:10:14,433 --> 01:10:17,785\nI'm going to make these notes available to\nyou guys, just some things I typed up for\n\n1502\n01:10:17,785 --> 01:10:19,180\nus before the show.\n\n1503\n01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:23,190\nI did happen to leave tkip and ccnp blank.\n\n1504\n01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:24,900\nSo, you want to fill them in for us?\n\n1505\n01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:25,440\n>> All right, sure.\n\n1506\n01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,430\n>> Don't actually type them in of course.\n\n1507\n01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:29,400\n>> Don't don't want to\nsee my typing abilities.\n\n1508\n01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:30,790\nWhere's my word processor?\n\n1509\n01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:35,000\n>> Because we've already mentioned tkip or\ntemporal key integrity protocol.\n\n1510\n01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,930\n>> I do want to make one\nmore mention of leap.\n\n1511\n01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:41,260\nOne thing inherently insecure about\nleap is that it made advantage\n\n1512\n01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:45,020\nthe authentication method\nif you will was MS Chap.\n\n1513\n01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:49,320\nAnd that's one of the reasons it's not,\nyou know, Peep is definitely preferred.\n\n1514\n01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:54,260\nAnd I believe today you'll see Peep with,\nEAP MS Chap version two is the most\n\n1515\n01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:59,520\ncommon of these authentication methods but\nLeap used MS Chap for its authentication.\n\n1516\n01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,460\nAnd like I said,\nwe'll go into other topics and\n\n1517\n01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:06,490\ntell you that MS chat doesn't store\nthose passwords very secure and\n\n1518\n01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:10,650\nthat's why it's kind of\nfell by the wayside.\n\n1519\n01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:13,630\n>> It was susceptible to replay\nattacks because it didn't have any\n\n1520\n01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:15,010\ntimestamp information in there.\n\n1521\n01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:16,970\nSo I didn't have to break the encryption.\n\n1522\n01:11:16,970 --> 01:11:19,890\nI could capture your authentication\ntraffic and then just replay it\n\n1523\n01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:22,650\nat a later time, and it looked like\nyou were authenticating again, and\n\n1524\n01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:26,280\nthere was no way for the system to\nknow that that was a packet from\n\n1525\n01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:30,060\ntwo hours ago or yesterday or\nanything like that.\n\n1526\n01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:34,760\n>> Yeah, and so Cisco also has this\nEAP fast because you don't need\n\n1527\n01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:38,390\nthe complexities of setting up a tunnel\nand the certificate of authentication.\n\n1528\n01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:40,790\nMaybe don't have the PKI to support it.\n\n1529\n01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:44,690\nYou can still use it in a TAP pass as it\ngoes through a few different phases and\n\n1530\n01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:46,320\nit's just generally stronger than Leap.\n\n1531\n01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,380\n>> Okay, So where were we?\n\n1532\n01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,250\nWe're tkip, integrity protocol.\n\n1533\n01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:50,880\n>> Some details on TKET.\n\n1534\n01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,600\n>> This was actually released as WPA.\n\n1535\n01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,246\nThis is what WPA brought.\n\n1536\n01:11:55,246 --> 01:11:58,024\nIt said okay,\nwe're going to still use that web,\n\n1537\n01:11:58,024 --> 01:12:02,719\nbut not really a wet key, but we're still\nusing the same RC cypher, and that's what\n\n1538\n01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:07,353\ngives the backwards compatibility on the\nweb based devices that only support web so\n\n1539\n01:12:07,353 --> 01:12:08,574\nyou can still use it.\n\n1540\n01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:13,442\nBut Again, it just means every frame\nthat I send across an 802.11 network\n\n1541\n01:12:13,442 --> 01:12:15,850\nis gonna have a unique encryption key.\n\n1542\n01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:19,964\nThe theory is that the encryption\nkey doesn't last long enough for\n\n1543\n01:12:19,964 --> 01:12:22,850\nthe attackers to gain any foothold on it.\n\n1544\n01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:27,440\nBut there again,\nusing that weaker RC4 stream cypher.\n\n1545\n01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:31,200\nIt was eventually replaced with\nwhat you mentioned earlier, AES.\n\n1546\n01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,760\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n1547\n01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:36,190\nAnd then CCMP, my favorite acronym\nin the entire book, I think.\n\n1548\n01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:37,070\n>> Can you help me out with that one?\n\n1549\n01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:38,006\n>> I'm gonna let you do\nthis right on your own.\n\n1550\n01:12:38,006 --> 01:12:39,476\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a pop quiz,\n\n1551\n01:12:39,476 --> 01:12:41,061\nI'm gonna see if Wes can get this one.\n\n1552\n01:12:41,061 --> 01:12:43,573\n>> This is Counter Mode\nwith Cipher-block chain and\n\n1553\n01:12:43,573 --> 01:12:46,000\nmessage authentication code protocol.\n\n1554\n01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,050\n>> What?\n[LAUGH]\n\n1555\n01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:48,029\n>> Don't try to say that ten times fast,\n\n1556\n01:12:48,029 --> 01:12:48,833\nI can't even say it once fast.\n\n1557\n01:12:48,833 --> 01:12:51,011\n>> I can't even repeat what you just said.\n\n1558\n01:12:51,011 --> 01:12:55,608\n>> [LAUGH] This is one that,\nit's based on AES encryption.\n\n1559\n01:12:55,608 --> 01:13:00,093\nIt gets away from the earlier RC4 stream\ncipher gives us access to advanced\n\n1560\n01:13:00,093 --> 01:13:04,480\nencryption standard, and\nit's really what's recommended today.\n\n1561\n01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,480\nIt does present some higher\nlevels of encryption, so\n\n1562\n01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:10,410\nyou might run into devices that\ndon't necessarily support it.\n\n1563\n01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:14,640\nSo, you might not get\nthe chance to use CCMP.\n\n1564\n01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:19,570\nAnd that's why WPA and WPA2, typically\ntoday you can see two options there.\n\n1565\n01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:22,740\nYou can see TKIP or you could see AES.\n\n1566\n01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:26,947\nAnd if it's AES that you choose, it's\ngonna be that again, that counter mode\n\n1567\n01:13:26,947 --> 01:13:30,995\nwith chaining block cipher block\nmessage authentication code protocol.\n\n1568\n01:13:30,995 --> 01:13:33,171\n[CROSSTALK] Now you can type that in.\n\n1569\n01:13:33,171 --> 01:13:34,820\nPaul's said, Paul's challenge.\n\n1570\n01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:37,100\nWell, you can go ahead and\ntype that one in, right?\n\n1571\n01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:40,720\nCounter mode cypher block\nchaining message authentication.\n\n1572\n01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:43,590\n>> Now that I think I ran spell check on\nthat real quick let's just make sure I\n\n1573\n01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:46,560\ngot that typed in there correct.\n\n1574\n01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:50,390\n>> Now, just remember, CCMP,\nwhen we look at the WPA2 standard,\n\n1575\n01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:53,310\nwhat it does is it gives us\na higher level of encryption.\n\n1576\n01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:58,050\nThe advanced encryption standard,\nwhich right now is the DoD\n\n1577\n01:13:58,050 --> 01:14:02,710\nendorsed of encryption standard for\ntop secret documents.\n\n1578\n01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:04,817\nSo it's supported right now.\n\n1579\n01:14:04,817 --> 01:14:05,658\n>> Oh you guys saw me cheat there.\n\n1580\n01:14:05,658 --> 01:14:06,524\n>> Oh, oh!\n\n1581\n01:14:06,524 --> 01:14:07,981\n>> They saw me cheat I\ndidn't really type that.\n\n1582\n01:14:07,981 --> 01:14:11,040\n[LAUGH]\n>> Copy, cut, paste man.\n\n1583\n01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:17,170\nSo yeah, TKIP brought in WPA, CCMP WPA2.\n\n1584\n01:14:17,170 --> 01:14:21,368\nYou still get the option that you can use\nTKIP for maybe some of those older devices\n\n1585\n01:14:21,368 --> 01:14:24,035\nthat just don't support\nthe higher levels of AES.\n\n1586\n01:14:24,035 --> 01:14:26,370\n>> And that's something we\ndidn't mention back then.\n\n1587\n01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:32,290\nWe were talking about WEP and WPA and WPA2\nAs you said there, kinda slipped it in.\n\n1588\n01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:34,650\nWPA was backwards compatible.\n\n1589\n01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:38,960\nIt was like if you had a WEP you could\ntypically do a firmware upgrade on your\n\n1590\n01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,710\nrouter to support WPA to take\nadvantage advantage of that TKIP.\n\n1591\n01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:45,550\nWhen we moved to WPA2 and\n\n1592\n01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:48,720\nadvanced encryption standard,\nthat took a lot more processing power.\n\n1593\n01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:51,370\n>> Yes.\n>> To do that higher level of encryption,\n\n1594\n01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:55,210\nand it usually meant buying a new device,\nand buying new network adapters.\n\n1595\n01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:58,720\nFor all of your devices because they\nhad to be able to connect using WPA2.\n\n1596\n01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:00,540\nSo it was a hardware\noperate at that point,\n\n1597\n01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:03,770\nto go to that WPA2, for the most part.\n\n1598\n01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:04,900\n>> You know on an earlier segment,\n\n1599\n01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:08,480\nyou had mentioned 802.1x cuz a lot\nof times when they talk about WPA2,\n\n1600\n01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,880\nyou'll see 802.1x port based\nauthentication thrown in the mix.\n\n1601\n01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:15,640\nAnd it is not a part of the official\nstandard that it requires you to\n\n1602\n01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:16,270\nimplement that.\n\n1603\n01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:19,620\nIt's just an added physical layer\n\n1604\n01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:22,905\nof security implementation to what's\nalready happening at layer two.\n\n1605\n01:15:22,905 --> 01:15:23,574\n>> Right.\n\n1606\n01:15:23,574 --> 01:15:24,904\nExactly.\n\n1607\n01:15:24,904 --> 01:15:25,990\nAll right, well I tell you what.\n\n1608\n01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:30,490\nThat does a pretty good job of wrapping up\na lot of the authentication protocols and\n\n1609\n01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:32,880\nthings like that that we're\nusing with our wireless.\n\n1610\n01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:34,900\nSo I think it's a good point for\nus to take a break.\n\n1611\n01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,920\nWe'll stop, refill the drinks real quick.\n\n1612\n01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,980\nWe come back, we're going to take a look\nat some of the things we do setting up our\n\n1613\n01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:42,990\nwireless network.\n\n1614\n01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:46,300\nAntenna types, placements,\nsurveys, and things like that.\n\n1615\n01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:49,730\nSo you guys stick around,\nand we'll be right back.\n\n1616\n01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:57,390\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentleman,\n\n1617\n01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:58,550\nI hope all you enjoyed your break.\n\n1618\n01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:03,746\nAnd we are going to dive right back in to\nsome more wireless here in our episode 1.5\n\n1619\n01:16:03,746 --> 01:16:09,140\nwith our troubleshooting security issues\nrelated to our wireless networks.\n\n1620\n01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:11,160\nSo, as we talked a lot about\nthe authentication protocols, or\n\n1621\n01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,810\nsome of the different protocols,\nnot necessarily authentication protocols,\n\n1622\n01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:17,660\nbut some of the protocols we can use to\nhelp secure our wireless networks and\n\n1623\n01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:20,950\nprotect that data as it's traveling\nthrough our wireless network.\n\n1624\n01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:25,000\nNow, I wanna take a look at just some\nkind of best practices concepts for\n\n1625\n01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,585\nsetting up those access points, placing\nthose access points, and things like that.\n\n1626\n01:16:28,585 --> 01:16:29,380\n>> Mm-hm.\nDefinitely.\n\n1627\n01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:31,930\nI was going to say so,\nthe first thing I was thinking is,\n\n1628\n01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:34,740\nmaybe a little bit out of order here,\nbecause they talk about antenna placement,\n\n1629\n01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:36,410\nbut what about the site survey?\n\n1630\n01:16:36,410 --> 01:16:37,080\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n1631\n01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,190\n>> Can that help with antenna placement?\n\n1632\n01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:39,620\n>> Yes, yes, right.\n>> You know site surveys,\n\n1633\n01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:43,220\nwhen you decide that hey I need\nto implement a wireless network.\n\n1634\n01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:45,470\nOne of the first things you want to do,\nyou take a site survey and\n\n1635\n01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:48,920\na site survey can show you things\nlike surrounding access points.\n\n1636\n01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:52,220\nYou have other wireless networks in the\nproximity of where you're thinking about\n\n1637\n01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:57,460\nsetting up your access point,\nthings like what channel is\n\n1638\n01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:03,050\nthe access point on, it can help identify\nfor things like channel congestion.\n\n1639\n01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:05,950\nWe talked about hardening a router, right?\n\n1640\n01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:07,290\nWell, on a wireless access point,\n\n1641\n01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:09,050\na lot of times you'll see\nit's got a default channel.\n\n1642\n01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:10,190\nI don't know, I believe,\n\n1643\n01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:12,710\nI think the default a lot of times is\nchannel six on the like 2.4 spectrum?\n\n1644\n01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:14,850\n>> Yeah, probably right around there.\n\n1645\n01:17:14,850 --> 01:17:17,940\n>> And it's no different than any\nother concept on these defaults,\n\n1646\n01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:21,910\nwhen you have a lot of these access points\nthat have defaulted to a specific channel,\n\n1647\n01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:23,590\nthe site survey is going\nto let you know that.\n\n1648\n01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:27,305\nIt can cause channel congestion and\nagain, remember in security,\n\n1649\n01:17:27,305 --> 01:17:33,010\nit's about availability, and due to\nthat the way wireless Media access is.\n\n1650\n01:17:33,010 --> 01:17:34,640\nIt's kinda this wait in line method,\nright?\n\n1651\n01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,460\nWe talked about another episode's carrier\nsets multiple access collision avoidance.\n\n1652\n01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:40,230\n>> Right.\n>> So if you got a lot of communications,\n\n1653\n01:17:40,230 --> 01:17:43,180\nyou're gonna do a lot of waiting in\nline and then you couple in things\n\n1654\n01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:46,935\nlike interference and channel congestion\nand you might have an indefinite wait.\n\n1655\n01:17:46,935 --> 01:17:50,425\nSo, site surveys allow you to also check\nout things like the signal strength of\n\n1656\n01:17:50,425 --> 01:17:51,945\nyour antenna.\n\n1657\n01:17:51,945 --> 01:17:54,855\nSometimes you got just really\ncheap software that you can buy\n\n1658\n01:17:54,855 --> 01:17:55,535\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1659\n01:17:55,535 --> 01:17:57,200\n>> For the mobile markets.\n\n1660\n01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:02,100\nWhere you can launch up the application\nthat shows you the signal strength of your\n\n1661\n01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:05,380\nwireless network, and other wireless\nnetworks that are in close proximity to\n\n1662\n01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,200\nwhere your access points can be placed.\n\n1663\n01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,200\nAnd you can go to different\nlocations within your building and\n\n1664\n01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,610\nmaybe determine that you need\na better antenna placement.\n\n1665\n01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:14,850\nMaybe you need to reposition\nthe access point.\n\n1666\n01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:17,830\nMaybe you need to implement\nsomething like a wireless repeater.\n\n1667\n01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:21,510\nOr go into more of the business class\nwhere you implement like an extended\n\n1668\n01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:23,610\nservice set where you got\na couple of access points and\n\n1669\n01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:26,460\nthat gives you the coverage range.\n\n1670\n01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:29,180\nBut that's really something that can\nhelp with your antenna placement and\n\n1671\n01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:32,100\nknowing where we have to\ndirect those signals.\n\n1672\n01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:32,970\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n1673\n01:18:32,970 --> 01:18:34,330\nAnd if Jason,\nwe want to throw that up real quick,\n\n1674\n01:18:34,330 --> 01:18:37,595\nI don't think I'm getting anybody's\nproprietary information or what here.\n\n1675\n01:18:37,595 --> 01:18:39,720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is some program,\n\n1676\n01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,920\nwhat does that say Tamograph Site Survey?\n\n1677\n01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,320\nThis is an example of one of the many\nprograms that we might be able to get,\n\n1678\n01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,590\nthat can do what Wes is saying.\n\n1679\n01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:50,720\nDo that site survey, where we can take\na look at where our access points are.\n\n1680\n01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:54,140\nIf we need to move them making sure\nthat we're getting the proper coverage.\n\n1681\n01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:56,160\nCovering all the different\ncorners of the building.\n\n1682\n01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,750\nMaking sure there's no areas\nwhere users are gonna be\n\n1683\n01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,260\nthat don't have appropriate signals.\n\n1684\n01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:04,300\nNow not just signals but good enough\nsignal to, enough bandwidth and\n\n1685\n01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,180\nquality of signal.\n\n1686\n01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:08,780\nAnd that I'm not going too far beyond\n\n1687\n01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:09,840\nmy building-\n>> Good point.\n\n1688\n01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:10,490\nThat's right.\n\n1689\n01:19:10,490 --> 01:19:12,560\n>> Right?\nYou know, if you're in a single building.\n\n1690\n01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,340\nYou don't want your signal\ncovering the parking lot outside.\n\n1691\n01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:18,860\nWhere people could be sitting unmonitored\ngaining access to your network.\n\n1692\n01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:20,632\n>> Right.\nI don't notice that creepy white van\n\n1693\n01:19:20,632 --> 01:19:21,888\nsitting out there you know,\n\n1694\n01:19:21,888 --> 01:19:25,254\nthat's sitting there with the antenna\nout the window picking up my signal.\n\n1695\n01:19:25,254 --> 01:19:27,318\n>> Wait.\n>> Yeah, I saw you the other day,\n\n1696\n01:19:27,318 --> 01:19:28,203\nthat's right.\n\n1697\n01:19:28,203 --> 01:19:29,439\n>> Wait you found my van?\n\n1698\n01:19:29,439 --> 01:19:31,287\n[LAUGH] We're gonna have to\nchange some colors on that van.\n\n1699\n01:19:31,287 --> 01:19:31,869\n>> Yeah, right?\nYou know or\n\n1700\n01:19:31,869 --> 01:19:34,000\nif you're in a strip\nmall some situation or\n\n1701\n01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,498\nwhere you've got business\non different floors.\n\n1702\n01:19:36,498 --> 01:19:39,583\nI kinda wanna make sure my signal is,\ntry to at least,\n\n1703\n01:19:39,583 --> 01:19:43,012\neliminate some of that bleed\nof my signal into their areas,\n\n1704\n01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:47,040\nand as you said, making sure that\nwe've got a little bit of overlap.\n\n1705\n01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,440\nSo when people go roaming\nthrough the building,\n\n1706\n01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,940\nthey're not dropping signal completely and\nthen picking up with another access point.\n\n1707\n01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:55,366\nThere needs to be some\noverlap of those signals.\n\n1708\n01:19:55,366 --> 01:19:59,116\nSo a site survey gives you that\ngraphical representation typically-\n\n1709\n01:19:59,116 --> 01:19:59,661\n>> Definitely\n\n1710\n01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:01,240\n>> Of the different strengths of\n\n1711\n01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:05,471\nthe signal, in the different areas of your\nbuilding And that can help you move or\n\n1712\n01:20:05,471 --> 01:20:07,574\nplace initially those access points.\n\n1713\n01:20:07,574 --> 01:20:11,160\n>> And only talk about\nelectromagnet shielding, too.\n\n1714\n01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:14,430\nIf you have to employ some kind of\ndue diligence process where you have\n\n1715\n01:20:14,430 --> 01:20:17,880\nto make sure that that information's not\nradiating outside of a certain area.\n\n1716\n01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:22,220\nMaybe you have to\nimplement extra obstacles,\n\n1717\n01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:26,950\nin order to shield that information from\neven making its way into that location.\n\n1718\n01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:28,610\n>> Exactly.\nThen somewhere up here,\n\n1719\n01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:32,050\nI think another one of our points.\n\n1720\n01:20:32,050 --> 01:20:33,641\nYeah, is our antenna placement.\n\n1721\n01:20:33,641 --> 01:20:35,920\nThat's a good segue into that.\n\n1722\n01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,630\nCuz that antenna placement,\nthen based on that site survey,\n\n1723\n01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:42,960\nwe can kind of determine where the best\nlocation for those antennas are.\n\n1724\n01:20:44,315 --> 01:20:48,340\nWanting to make sure that it doesn't again\nextend beyond our physical boundaries\n\n1725\n01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:49,090\nof our organization.\n\n1726\n01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:49,680\n>> Sure.\n\n1727\n01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:53,260\nAnd we talk about it in other episodes,\ntoo, when you need to upgrade a system.\n\n1728\n01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:55,040\nWe can scale out or we can scale up.\n\n1729\n01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,210\nWell, maybe this access point's not\neven gonna give me the coverage range\n\n1730\n01:20:58,210 --> 01:20:59,290\nthat I need.\n\n1731\n01:20:59,290 --> 01:21:00,440\nSo we scale up.\n\n1732\n01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,110\nWe either can upgrade the component or\n\n1733\n01:21:02,110 --> 01:21:04,310\nwe can just completely add\nanother component to it.\n\n1734\n01:21:04,310 --> 01:21:06,800\nScale out,\nmaybe we add an extra access point.\n\n1735\n01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,710\nAntenna placement is very,\n\n1736\n01:21:08,710 --> 01:21:12,445\nvery important and let's also understand\nthat there is different antenna types.\n\n1737\n01:21:12,445 --> 01:21:17,695\nAntenna placement might be based on\nliterally moving the entire access point\n\n1738\n01:21:17,695 --> 01:21:20,435\nrather than having other antennas\nthat you can literally move,\n\n1739\n01:21:20,435 --> 01:21:22,185\nwhich we'll talk about here in a second.\n\n1740\n01:21:22,185 --> 01:21:24,815\n>> Yeah, in fact I got them pulled up if\nwe want to take a look at those next.\n\n1741\n01:21:24,815 --> 01:21:26,195\n>> Yeah, perfect, yeah.\n\n1742\n01:21:26,195 --> 01:21:27,425\n>> Several different types we can use,\n\n1743\n01:21:27,425 --> 01:21:29,173\ndepending on the area that\nwe're trying to cover.\n\n1744\n01:21:29,173 --> 01:21:32,955\nIf we have omnidirectional type antennas,\n\n1745\n01:21:32,955 --> 01:21:36,069\nput out basically,\nthey might say circular.\n\n1746\n01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:43,000\nTechnically an omnidirectional is supposed\nto be spherical in its radiation pattern.\n\n1747\n01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,456\nBut because of the limitation\nof the manufacturing process and\n\n1748\n01:21:46,456 --> 01:21:50,490\nin the way we make those antennas,\nit typically looks like a doughnut.\n\n1749\n01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:54,730\nDown around the actual antenna, not to\nscale, but you can imagine it's squeezed\n\n1750\n01:21:54,730 --> 01:21:58,810\nin around the antenna and then it widens\nout and kind of loops back around.\n\n1751\n01:21:58,810 --> 01:22:00,440\nSo from the side and\n\n1752\n01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:03,380\nfrom the top it actually looks\nkinda like a doughnut pattern.\n\n1753\n01:22:03,380 --> 01:22:06,940\n>> And like you said, you've got some of\nthose antenna types up there on the screen\n\n1754\n01:22:06,940 --> 01:22:12,030\nhere, and you should be familiar with\nsome of these, like that ceiling dome.\n\n1755\n01:22:12,030 --> 01:22:14,850\nYou might hear the term blister antenna.\n\n1756\n01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:17,270\nBlister antenna looks\nlike a smoke detector.\n\n1757\n01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:18,590\nThat's really what it looks like.\n\n1758\n01:22:18,590 --> 01:22:20,540\nAnd a lot of times you'll see\nit just has a single wire.\n\n1759\n01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:23,260\nOr if the wire is going through\na drop ceiling you might not even\n\n1760\n01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:24,410\nsee the wire there.\n\n1761\n01:22:24,410 --> 01:22:26,970\nBut a blister antenna looks\na lot like a smoke detector and\n\n1762\n01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:29,370\nit's an omnidirectional one that\nradiates the pattern in all directions.\n\n1763\n01:22:29,370 --> 01:22:33,810\nThe other one we got and I always think\nback to the old Crocodile Dundee movie.\n\n1764\n01:22:33,810 --> 01:22:34,990\nIs the blade antenna.\n\n1765\n01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:36,910\nAnd the blade antenna was\non the back of that limo.\n\n1766\n01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:38,710\nAnd that guy goes out there and\nhe breaks it off there and\n\n1767\n01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:40,900\nhe throws it like a boomerang.\n\n1768\n01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:43,250\nThe blade antennas they're\nalso omnidirectional antennas.\n\n1769\n01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:45,750\nYou find them in limousines and stuff\nlike that, and they really look like,\n\n1770\n01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:48,030\nsometimes they can look\nlike a tail fin to a jet.\n\n1771\n01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:49,080\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1772\n01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,270\n>> Another form of an omnidirectional.\n\n1773\n01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:52,960\nThat rubber duck,\nI've never heard of that one.\n\n1774\n01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,200\n>> I've never heard it called a rubber\n\n1775\n01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:59,610\nduck until this edition\nof the Security+ exam.\n\n1776\n01:22:59,610 --> 01:23:01,330\nWe've dealt with them before.\n\n1777\n01:23:01,330 --> 01:23:05,520\nWe have our walkie-talkies, the little\nrubber antennas that come out of them.\n\n1778\n01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,110\nThe old WRT54Gs.\n\n1779\n01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:09,170\nI had those, I call them dipolar antennas.\n\n1780\n01:23:09,170 --> 01:23:11,031\nThey have straight up and down poles, but\n\n1781\n01:23:11,031 --> 01:23:13,850\nthey're omnidirectional\n>> Usually typically take BNC connections\n\n1782\n01:23:13,850 --> 01:23:17,820\nand they just lock on there, same\nthing you have to Citizens Band Radio.\n\n1783\n01:23:17,820 --> 01:23:19,510\n>> Exactly.\nI guess\n\n1784\n01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:20,790\nthey're not calling them rubber ducks.\n\n1785\n01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:23,520\n>> Interesting.\n>> Who knew, right?\n\n1786\n01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,600\nAnd you said blisters or ceiling dome.\n\n1787\n01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,198\nSane kind of thing.\nIs that an antenna?\n\n1788\n01:23:27,198 --> 01:23:27,980\nIs that a camera?\n\n1789\n01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:29,210\nIs that a smoke alarm?\n\n1790\n01:23:29,210 --> 01:23:31,010\nBut that thing that sits up there.\n\n1791\n01:23:31,010 --> 01:23:32,070\n>> I don't care what the camera says.\n\n1792\n01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:32,610\nIt lies.\n\n1793\n01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:33,210\n>> Right?\n\n1794\n01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:34,710\n>> Those are great for office settings.\n\n1795\n01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:36,290\nYou just dump them up into ceiling tile.\n\n1796\n01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:38,950\nWe typically have a space up\nthere we can run our wires or\n\n1797\n01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:42,400\nsomething like that,\nrelatively easy to place.\n\n1798\n01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,580\nAnd if we're trying to\ncover an office building,\n\n1799\n01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:49,190\nyou can imagine a circle is a pretty\ngood pattern to throw out to cover\n\n1800\n01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:51,480\nan office area or something like that.\n\n1801\n01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,340\nBut not always the shape\nwe're looking for.\n\n1802\n01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:53,840\n>> That's right.\n\n1803\n01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:59,600\nBecause like you said the pattern's more-\n>> Circular.\n\n1804\n01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,360\n>> Circular.\n\n1805\n01:24:00,360 --> 01:24:03,310\nYeah we'll make our own contributions\nto the English language here.\n\n1806\n01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:06,660\nBut it radiates the pattern\nin all directions and\n\n1807\n01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:09,320\nit's not really\na concentrated focused beam.\n\n1808\n01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:12,080\nAnd that's where we move into\nthe next type of antenna that\n\n1809\n01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:15,148\nare called directional antennas,\nlike the Yagi-based antenna,\n\n1810\n01:24:15,148 --> 01:24:18,820\nthat really looks like a set\nof metal cross-sections.\n\n1811\n01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:21,200\nGoing back to the older Yagi antenna where\n\n1812\n01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:24,890\nmaybe you had the traditional\nanalog television.\n\n1813\n01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:28,620\nI remember my grandparents had one\nof these on a big 70-foot pole, and\n\n1814\n01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:31,480\nyou could just use this little\n\n1815\n01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:36,481\nmachine that just had a series of gears\nthat would just move the Yagi antenna.\n\n1816\n01:24:36,481 --> 01:24:37,730\n>> So, you guys were fancy.\n\n1817\n01:24:37,730 --> 01:24:41,410\nI had to get out there and turn the pole\nby hand while my dad was in there going,\n\n1818\n01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:44,540\nlittle more, little more, wait,\nturn it back, turn it back.\n\n1819\n01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:47,920\n>> No, I had to do the same thing, and\nthen you just happen to touch the pole\n\n1820\n01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:50,930\nthere when you moved it and it was\nthe right direction, but if you let it go.\n\n1821\n01:24:50,930 --> 01:24:52,180\nYou'd get static again.\n\n1822\n01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:53,620\nSo you'd have to stand out there and\n\n1823\n01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:55,883\nhold that whole antenna while\nyour dad's watching TV.\n\n1824\n01:24:55,883 --> 01:24:59,354\n>> It's the last ten minutes of\nthe football game, can you just hold it?\n\n1825\n01:24:59,354 --> 01:25:00,113\n>> Can you stay right there?\n\n1826\n01:25:00,113 --> 01:25:00,780\n[LAUGH].\n\n1827\n01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:01,390\n>> So yes I did.\n\n1828\n01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:05,132\n>> Okay good, so I always think of the\nnature shows when they're tracking down\n\n1829\n01:25:05,132 --> 01:25:07,506\nthat guy with tracking collar on him\n>> Yep, that's right.\n\n1830\n01:25:07,506 --> 01:25:10,660\n>> Cuz it'll get a stronger signal\nas you get that thing lined up with\n\n1831\n01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:12,250\nthat transmitting end.\n\n1832\n01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:13,340\nYou guys have seen these.\n\n1833\n01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:16,880\nThese are your typical\nYagi-type antennas here.\n\n1834\n01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,240\nAnd there's like an old aerial\nfrom a TV probably, but\n\n1835\n01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:22,670\nsame concept when we look at Yagis for\nour wireless networks.\n\n1836\n01:25:22,670 --> 01:25:24,070\nSo we've got the Yagis.\n\n1837\n01:25:24,070 --> 01:25:26,420\nAnd then we've got these parabolics.\n\n1838\n01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:27,330\n>> Satellite dishes.\n\n1839\n01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:28,530\nThey are very basic.\n\n1840\n01:25:28,530 --> 01:25:29,480\nDirect TV.\n\n1841\n01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:34,140\nI'm not trying to drop any vendors here\nbut if you look at something as simple as\n\n1842\n01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:40,350\nsatellite television, you're talking\nabout a directional focused beam,\n\n1843\n01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:44,970\nconcentrated in a specific direction or\narea if you will.\n\n1844\n01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:48,130\nThose Yagi antennas,\nI always think of when these people\n\n1845\n01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:53,640\nthat work with wildlife out there on game\nreservations are tracking animals and\n\n1846\n01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:54,920\nstuff, they use either.\n\n1847\n01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:56,060\nSometimes they use both.\n\n1848\n01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:57,750\nYou'll see that Yagi antenna out there and\n\n1849\n01:25:57,750 --> 01:26:00,330\nsometimes you'll see\nthat big parabolic dish.\n\n1850\n01:26:00,330 --> 01:26:02,230\nAnd we also see it if you're\nsports fans out there,\n\n1851\n01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:03,650\nI believe you see them on the sidelines.\n\n1852\n01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:04,760\n>> With the microphones.\n\n1853\n01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:08,500\nSame concept because it's that dish that's\ntaking all of those, you got this much\n\n1854\n01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:11,750\nspace or whatever on that dish,\nand you can imagine that signal.\n\n1855\n01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:14,670\nIn fact, here's a good little diagram of,\n\n1856\n01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:17,310\nactually that one might\neven be a better one.\n\n1857\n01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:18,540\n>> There you go\n>> But you can see how,\n\n1858\n01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:20,880\nthis one's actually more\nlike what we're doing.\n\n1859\n01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,520\nSo the signal is coming in.\n\n1860\n01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:25,660\nAnd the shape, the bowl of that antenna\n\n1861\n01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:29,960\nis causing all those different signals\nto reflect back to an exact point.\n\n1862\n01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:32,280\nSo that's really where\nmy antenna point is.\n\n1863\n01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:36,290\nThere's this shape that's just focusing\nall of that signal to that point and\n\n1864\n01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:37,100\nthen that's were I'm picking.\n\n1865\n01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:38,330\nThat up.\n\n1866\n01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:43,080\nSo it is very concentrated and if you\nthink about taking an omnidirectional\n\n1867\n01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:48,240\nthat has to spend its power in sending\nthat signal out in a 360 degree pattern.\n\n1868\n01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:50,040\nWell if we just trim that up and\n\n1869\n01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:53,230\nsay you're only sending it out\nin this much of a pattern.\n\n1870\n01:26:53,230 --> 01:26:55,870\nI got much more power for that space.\n\n1871\n01:26:55,870 --> 01:26:58,480\n>> So it can go a lot further.\n\n1872\n01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:01,430\nAlthough it can be a little difficult\nto connect sometimes because it\n\n1873\n01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:04,810\nis such a focused beam\n>> If it's not lined up just right on\n\n1874\n01:27:04,810 --> 01:27:05,850\neither end.\n\n1875\n01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:07,480\nWe could lose signal.\n\n1876\n01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:11,490\n>> Well I think of the old\nlaptop-based monitors.\n\n1877\n01:27:11,490 --> 01:27:14,700\nI know it's a different concept, but\nif you look at the earlier LCD passive\n\n1878\n01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:17,110\nmatrix screens,\nyou had to sit right in front of them.\n\n1879\n01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:18,037\nIf you moved to the side,\nyou couldn't see them.\n\n1880\n01:27:18,037 --> 01:27:22,760\nIf you look at a highly\nconcentrated signal strength,\n\n1881\n01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:28,220\nif you move to the outsides of\nthis you can lose signal as well.\n\n1882\n01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:31,320\nAnd when we talk about\ndirectional antennas\n\n1883\n01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,970\nin wireless networks we're\ntalking about data signals.\n\n1884\n01:27:33,970 --> 01:27:36,700\nIf you're talking about some of those\n\n1885\n01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:41,860\nsolar space observatories,\nthe concept is still the same.\n\n1886\n01:27:41,860 --> 01:27:43,330\nIt's just a different type of signal.\n\n1887\n01:27:43,330 --> 01:27:47,500\nIt's still electromagnetic energy that's\nbeing radiated off of this device that's\n\n1888\n01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:52,830\nthen directed to another receiver\nthat's gonna then turn that same\n\n1889\n01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:56,530\nelectromagnetic energy and turn it back\ninto a data signal that it can process.\n\n1890\n01:27:56,530 --> 01:28:00,043\nWhether it's voice, whether it's audio,\nwhether it's just data communications.\n\n1891\n01:28:00,043 --> 01:28:04,253\nOne of the things to keep in mind is that\nwhen you have these directional antennas,\n\n1892\n01:28:04,253 --> 01:28:07,497\nit is important to place them and\nfocus them in the right areas.\n\n1893\n01:28:07,497 --> 01:28:11,098\nAnd a lot of these access points you'll\nsee, you'll have multiple antennas.\n\n1894\n01:28:11,098 --> 01:28:15,923\nAnd it is important, through site surveys\nand paying attention to signal strengths,\n\n1895\n01:28:15,923 --> 01:28:18,698\nthat the pattern is radiating\nin the direction and\n\n1896\n01:28:18,698 --> 01:28:20,567\nthe coverage area that you need.\n\n1897\n01:28:20,567 --> 01:28:24,536\nWith omnidirectionals, you're really,\nyou don't get that benefit,\n\n1898\n01:28:24,536 --> 01:28:27,880\nyou really have to reposition\nthe whole entire access point.\n\n1899\n01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:28,500\n>> Right.\n\n1900\n01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:32,130\n>> And maybe even go as far as putting\nin like a wireless range extender or\n\n1901\n01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:34,020\njust a basic repeater, if you will.\n\n1902\n01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:36,631\n>> Oh our network is just crawling today,\nI tell you what.\n\n1903\n01:28:36,631 --> 01:28:40,392\n[LAUGH] I was going to go ahead and draw\nup a, you know, we took a look at that\n\n1904\n01:28:40,392 --> 01:28:44,590\nparabolic, and a pattern and\na little bit of the shape of the antenna.\n\n1905\n01:28:44,590 --> 01:28:46,430\nI didn't do one for\nthe omni directional so\n\n1906\n01:28:46,430 --> 01:28:49,060\nI'm going to see if I\ncan get this to respond.\n\n1907\n01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:50,250\nI was talking about the donut.\n\n1908\n01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:51,250\n>> There's that donut.\n\n1909\n01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:52,020\n>> The donut.\n\n1910\n01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:54,870\n>> Yup.\n>> Or the kind of the squeezed shape there\n\n1911\n01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:59,040\nwhere you can see in the middle it's looks\nlike a black hole from this point here,\n\n1912\n01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,280\nbut it's going to be the same thing\non the top and the bottom, right.\n\n1913\n01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,170\nSo, that middle doesn't really.\n\n1914\n01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:06,690\nBack in the day, all right,\nsilly story here.\n\n1915\n01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:08,940\nI know I had my old WRT 54G, right.\n\n1916\n01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:13,431\nAnd before that the BEF\n>> I have the precursor to the WRT,\n\n1917\n01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:15,390\nI had the E3000,\n[CROSSTALK] or the E series.\n\n1918\n01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:16,261\n>> And then with the B.\n\n1919\n01:29:16,261 --> 01:29:18,390\nI don't if you've ever had any of the B,\nthe wireless Bs.\n\n1920\n01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:20,070\nIt's like a BEF something.\n\n1921\n01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:23,180\nI don't think you remember that.\n\n1922\n01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:24,350\n>> No, you were rich.\n\n1923\n01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:27,190\n>> I'm old.\n[LAUGH] But it had the two dipole antenna\n\n1924\n01:29:27,190 --> 01:29:32,860\non the back of it and when I set it there\non my desk, I had to make it look cool.\n\n1925\n01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:35,960\nSo I wanted those antennas kind of\ncocked out to angle like this, right.\n\n1926\n01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:37,770\n>> To make it look like\na wireless access point.\n\n1927\n01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:39,010\n>> It looks really cool, right.\n\n1928\n01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:43,108\nBut the problem is if you think about the\nway this is radiating the patterns now,\n\n1929\n01:29:43,108 --> 01:29:46,630\nalright, up and down basically.\n\n1930\n01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:48,460\nSo in my apartment, you know,\n\n1931\n01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:51,960\nI'm not getting a lot of signal\nacross my apartment this way.\n\n1932\n01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:54,690\nI'm sending a lot of it in to\nthe upper apartment above me and\n\n1933\n01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:55,900\nthen the other part down in the ground.\n\n1934\n01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:58,780\nSo it would have been much more efficient\nto have those guys straight up and down.\n\n1935\n01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:02,480\nWhere i'm focusing that energy\nacross in a horizontal pattern,\n\n1936\n01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,830\nunless I've got a two story\nbuilding which i didn't so.\n\n1937\n01:30:04,830 --> 01:30:08,820\nKind of a goof on my part back\nbefore I knew what I was doing.\n\n1938\n01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:09,780\n>> Yeah sure.\n>> But that's.\n\n1939\n01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:14,530\n>> Well it's like me where I've\ngot one of these ASUS, ASUS,\n\n1940\n01:30:14,530 --> 01:30:19,540\nwhat are they the N, oh it's not the N,\nit's the 66 A C router.\n\n1941\n01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:22,520\nAnd the where I've got it positioned,\nI do have to have one pointed\n\n1942\n01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:26,110\nat that direction because it\npoints it back down the hallway.\n\n1943\n01:30:26,110 --> 01:30:28,086\nWhere the other way just\npoints it to the other room.\n\n1944\n01:30:28,086 --> 01:30:29,990\nSo I kind of have,\nit's got three antennas, and\n\n1945\n01:30:29,990 --> 01:30:32,990\nI got that one [LAUGH] that's doesn't\nlook like it's positioned right, but\n\n1946\n01:30:32,990 --> 01:30:35,670\nit's actually to get that signal\nto go back down the hallway and\n\n1947\n01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:37,840\nactually make it out\nthere in the living room.\n\n1948\n01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:38,595\n>> Exactly.\nAnd, you know,\n\n1949\n01:30:38,595 --> 01:30:41,165\nthat's one that they don't mention\non here in this book, and I guess\n\n1950\n01:30:41,165 --> 01:30:45,615\nit really doesn't matter if it's not going\nto be on the exam is those, they call them\n\n1951\n01:30:45,615 --> 01:30:49,275\npanel antennas or the grid-type antennas\nwhere it's more of just a flat-panel.\n\n1952\n01:30:49,275 --> 01:30:51,415\n>> Oh yes, yes.\n>> It's another very focused.\n\n1953\n01:30:51,415 --> 01:30:55,005\nYou see them a lot of times\nin apartment complexes.\n\n1954\n01:30:55,005 --> 01:30:55,625\n>> On Star Wars.\n\n1955\n01:30:55,625 --> 01:30:56,415\nOn the Millenium Falcon.\n\n1956\n01:30:56,415 --> 01:30:59,065\n>> Yeah, you definitely see them\non the Millenium Falcon as well.\n\n1957\n01:30:59,065 --> 01:30:59,565\n>> On R2D2.\n\n1958\n01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:01,650\n>> Exactly, yeah, exactly.\n\n1959\n01:31:01,650 --> 01:31:05,820\nSo we're looking at these different\nantenna types and we're really trying to\n\n1960\n01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:10,430\nfigure out what's the best way to get the\ncoverage and what's the best way to maybe\n\n1961\n01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:13,510\nreduce the number of antennas that\nI'm going to require altogether.\n\n1962\n01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:15,800\nSo, we picked one that fits\nthe shape of our building.\n\n1963\n01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:17,640\nIf we've got a, I think back on that one,\n\n1964\n01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:20,210\nI don't know if you guys noticed it\nwhile I was doing that event search.\n\n1965\n01:31:20,210 --> 01:31:21,680\nIt was a very strange shaped building.\n\n1966\n01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:24,790\nIt looked like a V where\nit was two hallways, and\n\n1967\n01:31:24,790 --> 01:31:26,890\noffices down either side of this hallway.\n\n1968\n01:31:26,890 --> 01:31:29,910\nAnd if I was going to\ndo omni directionals,\n\n1969\n01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:33,090\nI'd have to place quite a few omni\ndirectionals down that hallway.\n\n1970\n01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:34,490\nDown either one of those hallways.\n\n1971\n01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:35,100\n>> Sure.\n\n1972\n01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:38,690\n>> Where as if I have more of the\ndirectional type antennas, I can put it at\n\n1973\n01:31:38,690 --> 01:31:42,660\none end of that hallway and get all the\nway down that hallway with that one and\n\n1974\n01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:45,930\nmaybe one at the other end pointing back\nthe other way to give me some overlap.\n\n1975\n01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:47,220\nSo I eliminate two or\n\n1976\n01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:50,420\nthree placements of my access points\nby picking the right antenna.\n\n1977\n01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:52,790\nAnd I also eliminate a lot of the bleed.\n\n1978\n01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:55,030\nBecause if I was doing omnidirectionals.\n\n1979\n01:31:55,030 --> 01:31:57,730\nTo get across that hallway you\nhave to make sure I didn't end up\n\n1980\n01:31:57,730 --> 01:32:00,060\noverlapping a little bit to\nthe outside of the building.\n\n1981\n01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:01,770\n>> That's right.\n>> Whereas with those highway directionals\n\n1982\n01:32:01,770 --> 01:32:04,630\nI can really keep it\nfocused down that hallway.\n\n1983\n01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:05,280\n>> Sure.\n\n1984\n01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:08,420\n>> Or in places where warehouses\nwhere you've got big shelving that\n\n1985\n01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:09,410\ninterferes with signals.\n\n1986\n01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:13,050\nYou might need a directional antennas at\nthe end of each one of those aisles, to\n\n1987\n01:32:13,050 --> 01:32:16,500\nget that signal down through there so they\ncan use their little scanning devices.\n\n1988\n01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,970\nAnd do their inventory, things like that.\n\n1989\n01:32:18,970 --> 01:32:19,790\n>> That's right, and\n\n1990\n01:32:19,790 --> 01:32:23,540\nwith more people being on these wireless\nnetworks you're going to see the amount of\n\n1991\n01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:28,650\nantennas on these devices I would say\njust may be exponentially increasing.\n\n1992\n01:32:28,650 --> 01:32:32,120\nLike you see, for instance, you talk\nabout the earlier days you'd see two,\n\n1993\n01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:35,780\nwe can say we see a lot of common\nto have three, sometimes four.\n\n1994\n01:32:35,780 --> 01:32:38,750\nYou can go out and look at some\nof the Cisco based access points.\n\n1995\n01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:40,730\nThey're following under some of\nthe new wireless standards and\n\n1996\n01:32:40,730 --> 01:32:41,690\nthey have eight antennas on them.\n\n1997\n01:32:41,690 --> 01:32:42,480\n>> Yeah, yeah, exactly.\n\n1998\n01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,750\n>> Four down once side and\nfour down the other,\n\n1999\n01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:46,815\ntaking advantage of some of the other.\n\n2000\n01:32:46,815 --> 01:32:51,758\nThe other communication types\nwithin wireless networking that in\n\n2001\n01:32:51,758 --> 01:32:55,376\na nut shell just allows\nto bring more information\n\n2002\n01:32:55,376 --> 01:32:59,877\nsimultaneously to multiple\nusers across those networks and\n\n2003\n01:32:59,877 --> 01:33:05,633\nespecially as our high definition video\nand multi media starts to increase.\n\n2004\n01:33:05,633 --> 01:33:11,596\nWe really do need those antennas because\nit increases the amount of information\n\n2005\n01:33:11,596 --> 01:33:17,650\nyou can send simultaneously over the\naccess point or over the wireless network.\n\n2006\n01:33:17,650 --> 01:33:22,221\n>> And we've got backfire antennas which\nis another one that honestly I haven't\n\n2007\n01:33:22,221 --> 01:33:26,750\nreally dealt with but\nit's another type of directional antenna.\n\n2008\n01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:28,899\nLet me see if I can find\nan image of one here.\n\n2009\n01:33:30,273 --> 01:33:31,329\nThere is goes.\n\n2010\n01:33:31,329 --> 01:33:33,470\nGoogle's playing along a little bit.\n\n2011\n01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:34,980\nI don't really want the pattern.\n\n2012\n01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:36,720\nBut it's just a highly\ndirectional antenna.\n\n2013\n01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:44,145\nI'll get this pulled up here.\n\n2014\n01:33:44,145 --> 01:33:45,710\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n2015\n01:33:45,710 --> 01:33:47,740\nWe got backfire antennas and\nwe also get cantennas,\n\n2016\n01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:49,860\nwhich I'll throw up an image, as well.\n\n2017\n01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:53,440\nIn fact, I don't know if, Nate,\nyou still got that over there?\n\n2018\n01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:56,790\nOr did you take that thing home?\n\n2019\n01:33:56,790 --> 01:33:58,470\n>> Oh. [LAUGH] >> Nate has built one.\n\n2020\n01:33:58,470 --> 01:34:01,310\nAnd different ways you can build and\nyou can find the plans out there.\n\n2021\n01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:03,900\n>> Yep.\n>> It's a way to build a highly\n\n2022\n01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:06,710\ndirectional antenna using some\nstuff you find around the house.\n\n2023\n01:34:06,710 --> 01:34:09,000\n>> Yeah.\n>> Taking apart an antenna.\n\n2024\n01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:09,560\n>> Yep.\n\n2025\n01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:12,280\n>> Drilling maybe a hole inside of\na can making sure it's the right\n\n2026\n01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:12,820\nlength and diameter.\n\n2027\n01:34:12,820 --> 01:34:13,840\n>> Well that was the interesting.\n\n2028\n01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:17,220\nWhile he was putting it together, just\nthat you have to get the proportions right\n\n2029\n01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:19,850\nyou know again because you're\ntalking about a wave pattern.\n\n2030\n01:34:19,850 --> 01:34:24,170\nYou know and how you have to be very very\nconsistent in the type of can you've got.\n\n2031\n01:34:24,170 --> 01:34:26,600\nPosition of the components within the can.\n\n2032\n01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:31,160\nI mean it's not just as simple as putting\na coaxial cable in the back of a Pringles\n\n2033\n01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:32,010\ncan and calling it a day.\n\n2034\n01:34:32,010 --> 01:34:33,580\n>> Right.\n>> I mean there's a science to it.\n\n2035\n01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:34,140\nWhich is obvious.\n\n2036\n01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:37,240\nYou can see all these wave patterns that\nthey're talking about and showing you.\n\n2037\n01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:40,110\nThat you really have, if you're going\nto make a cantenna, you can buy them.\n\n2038\n01:34:40,110 --> 01:34:43,100\nIt makes it a little bit easier,\nmaybe not quite as fun.\n\n2039\n01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:46,270\nIt's always geeky to get in there and\nbuild it yourself, but\n\n2040\n01:34:46,270 --> 01:34:48,770\nit's not just simply throwing\na bunch of wires together.\n\n2041\n01:34:48,770 --> 01:34:50,140\nYou really have to do\nyour research on it and\n\n2042\n01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:52,350\nmake sure that you got\nthe proportions of the can right.\n\n2043\n01:34:52,350 --> 01:34:55,770\nThe placement of the coaxial cable\nthat goes into the back of it as well.\n\n2044\n01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:58,010\nWe'll leave that to\nthe professionals though, Nate.\n\n2045\n01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:00,440\n>> There's a good screen shot\nof one where you just basically,\n\n2046\n01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:03,630\nonce you know your wavelength,\nyou're dividing that baby up, so\n\n2047\n01:35:03,630 --> 01:35:06,890\nyour can being at least three\nquarters of a wavelength so\n\n2048\n01:35:06,890 --> 01:35:09,730\nyou can get most of that wavelength,\none complete wave in there.\n\n2049\n01:35:09,730 --> 01:35:11,460\nBut I think that the important\npart is this right here.\n\n2050\n01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:14,340\nQuarter of the wavelength\nfrom the end of the can.\n\n2051\n01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:17,690\nThe opening needs to be about\na half a wavelength and\n\n2052\n01:35:17,690 --> 01:35:23,030\nthen a quarter of a wavelength\ninto extending into that can.\n\n2053\n01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:27,860\nIf you don't hit those numbers still\nworks, but not as

Mm-hm.\n\n2215\n01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:55,200\n>> We know, we've learned in Network Plus\nfrom MAC, what our MAC address is,\n\n2216\n01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:58,570\nour media access control uniquely\nidentifies that network adapter.\n\n2217\n01:41:58,570 --> 01:42:02,360\nOne of things I can do to help secure\nmy wireless network is create a list.\n\n2218\n01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:05,940\nI can do either what we call a white list,\nor a black list.\n\n2219\n01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:09,160\nWith a white list, that's going to be\na list of addresses, MAC addresses,\n\n2220\n01:42:09,160 --> 01:42:10,610\nthat are allowed to connect.\n\n2221\n01:42:10,610 --> 01:42:12,470\nIf you attempt to connect\nto that access point and\n\n2222\n01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:14,930\nyou're not on the list,\nit's not going to allow you.\n\n2223\n01:42:14,930 --> 01:42:17,010\nJust the opposite would be a blacklist.\n\n2224\n01:42:17,010 --> 01:42:19,320\nAnybody can connect unless\nyou're on this list.\n\n2225\n01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:22,730\nIf you're on this list, you're not\nallowed to connect to that access point.\n\n2226\n01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:26,713\nDownside of the MAC address filtering,\nits effective.\n\n2227\n01:42:26,713 --> 01:42:31,270\nAll right, but it's easy to sniff traffic.\n\n2228\n01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:35,330\nIf I wait until a legitimate user connects\nto the network I can capture packets.\n\n2229\n01:42:35,330 --> 01:42:36,870\nI can see their MAC address.\n\n2230\n01:42:36,870 --> 01:42:40,420\nThen I can change my MAC address\nto match their MAC address.\n\n2231\n01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:41,600\nNow I'm on the list.\n\n2232\n01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:42,620\nRight?\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n2233\n01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:45,770\nSoftware, really it's your operating\nsystem that's telling the network your\n\n2234\n01:42:45,770 --> 01:42:46,430\nMac address.\n\n2235\n01:42:46,430 --> 01:42:50,930\nAnd if we can put another\nsoftware layer in there that kind\n\n2236\n01:42:50,930 --> 01:42:53,943\nof masks that we could use [CROSSTALK].\n\n2237\n01:42:53,943 --> 01:42:57,520\n>> You gotta be, you couple it with other\nthings, you don't just rely on this.\n\n2238\n01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:59,550\nBut you know, even if with deny list,\nthe blacklist,\n\n2239\n01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:02,780\nmaybe you've been paying attention,\nyou are doing Mac filtering.\n\n2240\n01:43:02,780 --> 01:43:07,710\nYou've got one employee, and you know what\ntheir Mac address is, and you suspect\n\n2241\n01:43:07,710 --> 01:43:11,520\nthat after you've gotten rid of them,\nmaybe whatever's going on you say well I\n\n2242\n01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:14,760\ncan put that Mac address on a blacklist\nyou're not getting on my network.\n\n2243\n01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:16,580\n>> Right.\n>> So that's that implicit.\n\n2244\n01:43:16,580 --> 01:43:19,380\nOr that explicit deny that we were\ntalking about from an earlier\n\n2245\n01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:22,530\nsegment there that you can say no, you\nare not allowed to get on this network.\n\n2246\n01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:23,610\n>> Exactly.\n\n2247\n01:43:23,610 --> 01:43:26,540\nAnd then the last one is\ngonna be the SSID broadcast.\n\n2248\n01:43:26,540 --> 01:43:29,300\nAnd once you mentioned that earlier\nthat your access points do what's\n\n2249\n01:43:29,300 --> 01:43:30,015\ncalled beaconing.\n\n2250\n01:43:30,015 --> 01:43:31,730\nMm-hm.\n>> When you look at your device and\n\n2251\n01:43:31,730 --> 01:43:34,610\nyou see a list of access\npoints in the area,\n\n2252\n01:43:34,610 --> 01:43:37,275\nhow does your device know those\naccess points are out there?\n\n2253\n01:43:37,275 --> 01:43:38,860\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Because those access points\n\n2254\n01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:39,530\nare beaconing.\n\n2255\n01:43:39,530 --> 01:43:43,060\nEvery so often, every few milliseconds,\nthey're spitting out their name.\n\n2256\n01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:45,780\nAnd what their security protocol is\nthat they're using so that you can\n\n2257\n01:43:45,780 --> 01:43:48,730\nclick on it and you can attempt to\nauthenticate to that access point.\n\n2258\n01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:52,880\nWell if I turn off that broadcast,\nnow you don't see it in your list and\n\n2259\n01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:55,230\nyou might not even be aware\nthat the network's in the area.\n\n2260\n01:43:55,230 --> 01:43:55,930\n>> That's right.\n\n2261\n01:43:55,930 --> 01:43:59,400\n>> And so again, as what I said,\nanother layer of defense.\n\n2262\n01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:02,256\nBoth of these techniques\nare easily bypassed, right?\n\n2263\n01:44:02,256 --> 01:44:04,470\n>> Yes.\n>> Because as along with the MAC address,\n\n2264\n01:44:04,470 --> 01:44:07,825\nbeing in the unencrypted part\nof the packet, so is the SSID.\n\n2265\n01:44:07,825 --> 01:44:08,365\n>> That's right.\n\n2266\n01:44:08,365 --> 01:44:12,282\n>> So if I capture legitimate traffic,\nwait til one of your users is connecting\n\n2267\n01:44:12,282 --> 01:44:16,012\nto your network I can see the SSID in\nthere and now I can manually enter that\n\n2268\n01:44:16,012 --> 01:44:20,014\nname in my connection device and I can\nconnect to that access point just fine.\n\n2269\n01:44:20,014 --> 01:44:21,160\n>> Yep, mm-hm.\n\n2270\n01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:25,240\n>> But it keeps the honest people honest,\nit slows the bad guys down a little bit\n\n2271\n01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:29,660\nand it's just another layer of defense\nthat we can add to our access point.\n\n2272\n01:44:31,420 --> 01:44:33,030\nIt does have a downside.\n\n2273\n01:44:33,030 --> 01:44:35,420\nIt makes it more difficult for\nlegitimate users to get in.\n\n2274\n01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:35,950\n>> That's right.\n\n2275\n01:44:35,950 --> 01:44:38,830\n>> As I hire new employees I've got to\nshow them what the name of the access\n\n2276\n01:44:38,830 --> 01:44:39,900\npoint is or the SSID.\n\n2277\n01:44:39,900 --> 01:44:41,800\nThey're gonna be able to type it in.\n\n2278\n01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:44,710\nIf they ever have to reconnect they're\ngonna have to call tech and say hey,\n\n2279\n01:44:44,710 --> 01:44:46,340\nwhat was the SSID for access point?\n\n2280\n01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:46,940\n>> Right.\n>> Cuz it's not gonna\n\n2281\n01:44:46,940 --> 01:44:48,230\nshow up in their list any more.\n\n2282\n01:44:48,230 --> 01:44:50,170\n>> Yeah.\n>> And so there is a downside to it.\n\n2283\n01:44:50,170 --> 01:44:53,630\nBut again, another layer of\ndefense that you have to decide if\n\n2284\n01:44:53,630 --> 01:44:57,150\nthe benefits outweigh the.\n\n2285\n01:44:57,150 --> 01:44:58,080\n>> The pros and the cons.\n\n2286\n01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:00,160\nBut you know, I like the point\nthat you made the one time.\n\n2287\n01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,850\nYou said it just keeps\nthe honest people out.\n\n2288\n01:45:01,850 --> 01:45:03,840\n>> Yeah. It really does. [LAUGH]\n>> It makes it harder for\n\n2289\n01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,300\nthe honest people to join your network.\n\n2290\n01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:06,805\nIt really doesn't stop the hackers\n\n2291\n01:45:06,805 --> 01:45:07,572\ntoo much-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n2292\n01:45:07,572 --> 01:45:09,177\n>> Because if they're outside there and\n\n2293\n01:45:09,177 --> 01:45:12,642\nthey're capturing data, then there's\ninformation that goes behind the scenes\n\n2294\n01:45:12,642 --> 01:45:16,500\nand management frames that's never really\naddressed to any one network adapter.\n\n2295\n01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:19,380\nIt's still got that SSID, you can find it.\n\n2296\n01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:20,193\n>> Right, yeah.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n2297\n01:45:20,193 --> 01:45:22,686\n>> But you can use other things like the\n\n2298\n01:45:22,686 --> 01:45:28,105\nold fake AP and SID spoof where it sends\nout a whole bunch of these false SSIDs.\n\n2299\n01:45:28,105 --> 01:45:28,744\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n2300\n01:45:28,744 --> 01:45:31,825\nthen you disable yours\nin the middle of it, and\n\n2301\n01:45:31,825 --> 01:45:34,600\nagain just another layer of protection.\n\n2302\n01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:35,150\n>> Well it keeps you.\n\n2303\n01:45:35,150 --> 01:45:37,770\nIf you have to have a little bit of\noverlap, and you're wireless network\n\n2304\n01:45:37,770 --> 01:45:41,327\nhappens to connect, or overlap a little\nbit to that business next to you.\n\n2305\n01:45:41,327 --> 01:45:41,930\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2306\n01:45:41,930 --> 01:45:45,400\n>> Those guys are over there saying, hey I\nget better signal from their access point\n\n2307\n01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:49,135\nthan ours, so they start bleeding over to\nyour network, sucking up your bandwidth.\n\n2308\n01:45:49,135 --> 01:45:51,110\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Well if they can't see that SSID,\n\n2309\n01:45:51,110 --> 01:45:52,810\nmaybe they never connect to\nit in the first place, right?\n\n2310\n01:45:52,810 --> 01:45:53,881\n>> Yeah.\n>> But the bad guys,\n\n2311\n01:45:53,881 --> 01:45:56,398\nyeah they got the tools,\nthey're gonna be able to figure it out.\n\n2312\n01:45:56,398 --> 01:45:56,980\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2313\n01:45:56,980 --> 01:45:59,640\n>> All right, well that ladies and\ngentlemen, I think is gonna do it for 1.5.\n\n2314\n01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:03,440\nI know we took it a little bit\npast our normal mark there, but\n\n2315\n01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:05,640\na lot of good information we wanted\nto share with you guys and go.\n\n2316\n01:46:05,640 --> 01:46:06,500\n>> This is fun stuff.\n\n2317\n01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:07,050\n>> Absolutely.\n\n2318\n01:46:07,050 --> 01:46:08,530\nWe could talk about this all day long.\n\n2319\n01:46:08,530 --> 01:46:09,740\nIn fact I'd love to.\n\n2320\n01:46:09,740 --> 01:46:13,270\nSo remember, unless you've got\nany more to add to the program?\n\n2321\n01:46:13,270 --> 01:46:13,970\n>> No, no.\n>> Great.\n\n2322\n01:46:13,970 --> 01:46:14,950\n>> I think we got it.\n\n2323\n01:46:14,950 --> 01:46:16,840\n>> We'd love to hear from you guys.\n\n2324\n01:46:16,840 -->

for\na moment.\n\n12\n00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.990\nWhat's so important about risks?\n\n13\n00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.050\n&gt;&gt; Risks are everywhere.\n\n14\n00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.620\nRisks are something that\nwe see on a daily basis.\n\n15\n00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.230\nSo it's something that we\nreally need to be aware of and\n\n16\n00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.010\nhere we are even in Security+.\n\n17\n00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.450\nBut also we're gonna be talking about it\na little bit later today in Project+.\n\n18\n00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.130\nSo it's not just something\nthat randomly comes up.\n\n19\n00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.630\nIt's in our businesses every day.\n\n20\n00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.140\nIt's something we have to think about.\n\n21\n00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.240\n&gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and\ndescribe that concept.\n\n22\n00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.800\nSo Cherokee, just explain to us briefly\nin terms of a security professional and\n\n23\n00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.770\nwhat are risks that we're talking about?\n\n24\n00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I think that it really\nhelps to look at the definitions here.\n\n25\n00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.240\nIf you wanna go ahead and look at my\ncomputer, I hate to do that to you, but\n\n26\n00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.470\nlet's look at them and then we'll go\nahead and talk about them individually.\n\n27\n00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.400\nBy definition,\na risk is the likelihood and impact or\n\n28\n00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.940\nconsequence of a threat actor\nexercising a vulnerability.\n\n29\n00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.610\nAnd I know it's very wordy there.\n\n30\n00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.970\nThat's why we need you\nguys to be able to see it.\n\n31\n00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.120\nOn the exam, you can identify the proper\nvocabulary term and the definition.\n\n32\n00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.920\nBut I think we really also need to make\nsure we understand all of the terms\n\n33\n00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.770\nthat go ahead and define risks.\n\n34\n00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.004\nSo that's what we'll go ahead and do here.\n\n35\n00:01:46.004 --> 00:01:49.715\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, so I understand\nthat there's actually also different types\n\n36\n00:01:49.715 --> 00:01:52.110\nof risks that we have\nto actually encounter.\n\n37\n00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.790\nSo let's go over those\ndifferent types of risks.\n\n38\n00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.669\nWhat do we wanna begin with?\n\n39\n00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.493\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's first start and look at\nthe actual other terms that we have here.\n\n40\n00:02:00.493 --> 00:02:01.343\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n41\n00:02:01.343 --> 00:02:05.740\n&gt;&gt; If you look at the definition\nit says a threat actor, okay.\n\n42\n00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.250\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So first of all,\n\n43\n00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.735\nI wanna make sure that you guys do\nunderstand threat actor before we proceed\n\n44\n00:02:10.735 --> 00:02:14.660\nbecause it could be confused\nwith a threat vector.\n\n45\n00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.565\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n46\n00:02:15.565 --> 00:02:18.915\n&gt;&gt; And the terms are similar but\nthey mean completely different things.\n\n47\n00:02:18.915 --> 00:02:21.910\nSo Ronnie, have you ever heard\nthreat actor and vector before?\n\n48\n00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.650\n&gt;&gt; Well, let's just say for the sake of\nour argument, I have not heard of it.\n\n49\n00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.260\n&gt;&gt; Great!\n&gt;&gt; And so please Cherokee,\n\n50\n00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.458\nwhat is the difference between\nthreat actor and threat vector?\n\n51\n00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:35.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\na threat vector is going to be how and\n\n52\n00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.960\nyour threat actor is going to be who?\n\n53\n00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.390\nAs I guess will be easiest\nway that I can explain it.\n\n54\n00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.590\nSo for instance, lets say you go ahead and\nreceive some kinda of virus,\n\n55\n00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.980\nmalware attached from a download,\nfrom attachment, from an email.\n\n56\n00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:59.720\nSo your actual vector, okay,\nwould be the email, that attachment.\n\n57\n00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.980\nAnd then your actor,\nyour threat actor, your bad actor,\n\n58\n00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.150\nwould be whomever sent or\ndistributed that email.\n\n59\n00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.180\nSo hopefully that makes sense for\nyou guys,\n\n60\n00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.612\nbecause before we continue I just want to\nmake sure that we're all on the same page.\n\n61\n00:03:12.612 --> 00:03:16.120\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, so Cherokee, now\nonce we actually understand that idea of\n\n62\n00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.790\nthe threat actor and threat vector, what\nelse do we actually need to understand?\n\n63\n00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.440\nWhat was this idea called vulnerabilities\nor threats and different things like that?\n\n64\n00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.560\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so a vulnerability by definition,\n\n65\n00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.040\nis a weakness that could, all right,\ncould being the keyword here.\n\n66\n00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.020\nCould be triggered accidentally or\n\n67\n00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.160\nexploited intentionally to\ncause a security breach.\n\n68\n00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.220\nSo Ronnie, something that I'm sure you're\nalready familiar with is here in Security+\n\n69\n00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.370\nand not just Security+ but sans, NIST,\nwe look at a lot of categorization.\n\n70\n00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.680\nSo we have categories for everything,\nso bear with me here guys,\n\n71\n00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.840\nwe're going to be looking at\nsome of those categories.\n\n72\n00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.240\nAnd then I'll also show you some that\nwe don't have to worry about for\n\n73\n00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.610\nthis certification.\n\n74\n00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.050\nBut we might wanna just kind\nof think about moving forward.\n\n75\n00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.280\nSo yeah, a vulnerability can exist, okay?\n\n76\n00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.500\nIt doesn't have to be acted upon,\n\n77\n00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.600\nbut if you have unpatched operating\nsystems, that could be a vulnerability.\n\n78\n00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.380\nPoor training for your company.\n\n79\n00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.270\nNot letting them know about certain\ntypes of issues that are out there,\n\n80\n00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.180\nso that would be a vulnerability.\n\n81\n00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.685\nAnd then we look at this term of threat,\nokay?\n\n82\n00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:33.345\nSo if we see threat, it's the potential\nfor threat agent or threat actor.\n\n83\n00:04:33.345 --> 00:04:34.655\nSame terminology there.\n\n84\n00:04:34.655 --> 00:04:37.525\nYou may see it worded\na little bit differently.\n\n85\n00:04:37.525 --> 00:04:42.575\nBut basically that's something or\nsomeone that may trigger that\n\n86\n00:04:42.575 --> 00:04:47.285\nvulnerability that we just saw,\naccidentally or exploited intentionally.\n\n87\n00:04:47.285 --> 00:04:51.380\nSo a lot of times, our vulnerabilities\n\n88\n00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.080\ncan even be triggered accidentally,\na lot of that happens in businesses.\n\n89\n00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:03.720\nSo again, categorizing it as intentional\nor unintentional, they could go ahead and\n\n90\n00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.580\nexercise a vulnerability that is\nto go ahead and breach security.\n\n91\n00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.650\nSo we'll talk about security\npolicies a little bit later, but\n\n92\n00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.320\nanything that basically defies your\nsecurity policy could go ahead and\n\n93\n00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.292\nfall on to that realm of security breach.\n\n94\n00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.820\nAlso, the path or\nthe tool used by the threat actor.\n\n95\n00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.100\nIt can be refered to as the threat\nvector like we just covered,\n\n96\n00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.610\nso just as long as you guys are good\nwith that, then we're good to go.\n\n97\n00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.840\n&gt;&gt; So let's make sure we can\ndistinguish the difference here.\n\n98\n00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.980\nYou gave us an example of a vulnerability,\n\n99\n00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.389\nwhat about an example of\na threat we can think about?\n\n100\n00:05:37.485 --> 00:05:41.580\n&gt;&gt; An example of a threat\nwould be perhaps,\n\n101\n00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.370\nit could be a disgruntled employee.\n\n102\n00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.700\nIt could be a hacker\n\n103\n00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.400\nkind of just scheduling a distributive\ndenial of service attack.\n\n104\n00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.130\nIt could be,\nwhat was an unlocked door, maybe.\n\n105\n00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.081\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Even just something simple like that,\n\n106\n00:05:59.081 --> 00:06:00.335\nthere's so many out there.\n\n107\n00:06:00.335 --> 00:06:04.304\nActually, and that's what we'll look\nat a little bit in a few moments here\n\n108\n00:06:04.304 --> 00:06:08.290\nto see how we have all these different\nrisks within our organization.\n\n109\n00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.560\nHow we gonna prioritize them,\nhow we gonna treolish them,\n\n110\n00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.360\nthey are not all weighted equally,\nthey don't have the same value.\n\n111\n00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.670\nWe shouldn't focus as much\nattention on them and\n\n112\n00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.030\nthat brings us to our last terminology\non that page there which is control.\n\n113\n00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.020\nOkay, so in a perfect world I\nwould have an unlimited budget for\n\n114\n00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.540\nmy organization, but\nthat's not always the case.\n\n115\n00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.930\nSince and so sometimes we have to pick and\n\n116\n00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:34.180\nchoose as to where we gonna be allocating\nour budget for that particular quarter.\n\n117\n00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:40.160\nSo, a control is a system or\nprocedure put in place to mitigate risk.\n\n118\n00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.440\nSo we're trying to either prevent it or\n\n119\n00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.640\nreduce the impact of it, or potentially\neven both there with our controls.\n\n120\n00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.680\nSo we'll also take a look at\nthat in a little bit as well.\n\n121\n00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.360\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee, now that\nwe understand at least the general\n\n122\n00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.480\ncategories and different types of risks\nthat were available, what is the process?\n\n123\n00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.910\nWhat do we actually have\nto do to understand\n\n124\n00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.710\nthe risk that we may face as\na professional for our organization\n\n125\n00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.190\nthat we tend to look at in terms of\ndifferent phases or something like that?\n\n126\n00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.520\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\nbecause risks are constantly, well,\n\n127\n00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.200\na growing company should be evolving and\nchanging with the times.\n\n128\n00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.980\nTherefore, your risks\nshould also be evolving.\n\n129\n00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.560\nLet's not just pretend we're\nin a stagnant environment and\n\n130\n00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.470\neverything's always gonna be the same.\n\n131\n00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.350\nSo we'll look at these phases but\nI want you to keep in mind\n\n132\n00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.750\nthat this is a cyclic process,\nmeaning let's go ahead and revisit.\n\n133\n00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.330\nNow depending on certain organizations and\nwhat their resources are.\n\n134\n00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.730\nYou may be going through this\nprocess on shorter durations,\n\n135\n00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.650\nmaybe semi-annually, but it really\njust depends on the organization.\n\n136\n00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.750\nSo if we can go ahead and\nlook at my screen.\n\n137\n00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.520\nI'll start here with these phases.\n\n138\n00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.243\nSo the first one we have here, number one.\n\n139\n00:07:49.243 --> 00:07:52.991\nIdentify your assets and\ndetermine their value.\n\n140\n00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:57.810\nOkay, so we're gonna talk about\nqualitative versus quantitative in\n\n141\n00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:03.590\na little bit In order to determine value,\nbut I want you to also think about assets.\n\n142\n00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.010\nWhat is an asset, Ronny?\n\n143\n00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.200\nHave you heard this term?\n\n144\n00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.830\n&gt;&gt; An asset I do understand.\n\n145\n00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.580\nIt's something of value\nthat we generally have.\n\n146\n00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.334\nBut, in terms of security, I always\nthink about what I want to protect,\n\n147\n00:08:13.334 --> 00:08:15.260\nthat's what I normally think about.\n\n148\n00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.456\n&gt;&gt; I like that, yeah.\n\n149\n00:08:16.456 --> 00:08:21.275\nBecause, it can be seen\nin many different ways.\n\n150\n00:08:21.275 --> 00:08:24.560\nAn acid is not always something\nthat's tangible okay,\n\n151\n00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.600\nlike a laptop or\na hard disk drives, or whatever.\n\n152\n00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.390\nIt doesn't always have to be an item.\n\n153\n00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.680\nWe also have intangible assets.\n\n154\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.110\nAnd here I have an employee,\nand your employee,\n\n155\n00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:40.820\nsometimes people don't always consider\nthat as an asset but it really is.\n\n156\n00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.300\nYou've got your brand,\nyour reputation that's an asset.\n\n157\n00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.790\nYou have, your policies.\n\n158\n00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:50.460\nA lot of work goes into putting these\npolicies together, a lot of thought.\n\n159\n00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:55.700\nSo, if those policies are destroyed,\nany kind of loss, okay.\n\n160\n00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.040\nSo yeah, things you wanna protect.\n\n161\n00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.270\nGood answer there, Ronny.\n\n162\n00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:02.990\nSo, that's the first step is to go\nahead and identify your assets.\n\n163\n00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:08.220\nSecond step, all right, would be to\nidentify the vulnerability to the asset.\n\n164\n00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:13.810\nSo, by taking a look at each individual\nasset and seeing where that asset is\n\n165\n00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:19.590\nvulnerable, it'll help you to go ahead and\ncome up with any kind of countermeasures,\n\n166\n00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:23.320\nyour security controls, to help you\ndecide what would be best for them.\n\n167\n00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.760\n&gt;&gt; Now, Jackie here we have to\nachieve take a look at that\n\n168\n00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.410\nin terms of being a security professional,\na lot of times is because we may think\n\n169\n00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:33.980\nthat it is the greatest product we ever\nhave, something I need to protect.\n\n170\n00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.620\nBut, if i don't take into account\nthe vulnerabilities that exists\n\n171\n00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.010\nI may find out that I'm actually\nintroducing a very strong vulnerability\n\n172\n00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:47.110\ninto my current set up, that could be\nkind of a big attack service for someone.\n\n173\n00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:50.650\nSo we do need to weigh that out in terms\nof actually understanding the risk that we\n\n174\n00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:51.940\nare going to implement.\n\n175\n00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.650\nSo, it's something that definitely\nis very much a priority and\n\n176\n00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:58.440\nwe're gonna identify the risks\nthat are actually in our business.\n\n177\n00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.390\nSo what's the next step there, Cherokee?\n\n178\n00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:05.090\n&gt;&gt; All right so moving along, we've got\nstep number three, threat assessments.\n\n179\n00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.618\nSo here I have,\nI don't know if you guys can see this.\n\n180\n00:10:08.618 --> 00:10:11.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This is my attacker down here.\n\n181\n00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.520\nAnd then this looks like a virus maybe,\nall right.\n\n182\n00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.200\nSo this is our malware here.\n\n183\n00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.760\nBut like we were talking about a few\nminutes ago, threats can come in all\n\n184\n00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.680\nshapes and sizes, so, go ahead and\nperform a threat assessment.\n\n185\n00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.230\nIf there's something that's out,\nif there's a particular virus like\n\n186\n00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:33.210\nthe I Love You or something like that,\nthen you're aware of them, okay.\n\n187\n00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:37.880\nYou can assess them, how would they\npotentially affect your organization?\n\n188\n00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:43.050\nSo, just being aware and\njust being not trying to act like your\n\n189\n00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:49.105\nenvironment is perfect, or impervious to\nany kind of attack, so, because no one is.\n\n190\n00:10:49.105 --> 00:10:49.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, Cherokee,\n\n191\n00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.840\nI don't mean to to take us off\non a tangent too far, but,\n\n192\n00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:56.040\nwhat's one of the best ways\nthat we can actually be aware\n\n193\n00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.410\nof the idea of assessing\nsomething like this?\n\n194\n00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:02.330\nI know what I try and do on a daily basis\nis read at least one article about that.\n\n195\n00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.190\n&gt;&gt; I love it.\nThat's perfect, Ronny, thank you.\n\n196\n00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.090\nI do that.\n\n197\n00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:09.840\nYou're really in that sense becoming\nmore proactive instead of reactive and\n\n198\n00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.440\nreally that's what it's all about.\n\n199\n00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.670\nIf you're following those hacking forums\nyou guys can find them all online,\n\n200\n00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:19.360\nyou get the latest tools, you know\nwhat's out there so you can go ahead and\n\n201\n00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.223\nbeef up your infrastructure\nto protect them accordingly.\n\n202\n00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:26.580\nSo, definitely and I say that\ncoming from an IT perspective but\n\n203\n00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.940\nin any kind of industry.\n\n204\n00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.560\nOkay, just kind of be up with the news,\nthe times,\n\n205\n00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.109\nanything that's going on within\nyour particular industry.\n\n206\n00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.325\nAll right,moving along,\nwe've got number four, the probability.\n\n207\n00:11:39.325 --> 00:11:43.790\nWe have a little grid here,\nso you can create a matrix,\n\n208\n00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:47.430\nyou can actually use\nseveral matrices to help\n\n209\n00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:52.510\ndetermine the proper path for\nyour organization.\n\n210\n00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.160\nLet me show you a couple of them.\n\n211\n00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.850\nSo, the first one we'll look\nat here is pretty basic.\n\n212\n00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:01.020\nThis is a rudimentary\ntraffic light impact grid.\n\n213\n00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:05.550\nAnd, what you want to do is, now I'll show\nyou some others that can, they can be very\n\n214\n00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:12.080\nin depth, but at the most basic form we\nsee the risk factor over here on the side.\n\n215\n00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.650\nSo for instance,\na Legacy operating system.\n\n216\n00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:19.310\nMaybe, I'm sure some companies out\nthere are still using some outdated\n\n217\n00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:22.310\noperating systems that aren't\nbeing supported any more.\n\n218\n00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:24.760\nWindows XP, perfect example, right.\n\n219\n00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.010\nSo let's go ahead and look at that factor.\n\n220\n00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.210\nThen you go ahead and\nassign an impact, right.\n\n221\n00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:35.040\nSo you have high, medium and low.\n\n222\n00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.280\nThat's what we're using for our impact\ngrid just to make things simple here.\n\n223\n00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.290\nSo, I'm going to go ahead and\n\n224\n00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:45.740\nassess it a medium level impact so\nI can still perform my functions.\n\n225\n00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.200\nI have some options.\n\n226\n00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.830\nI could air gap that\nsystem if I needed to.\n\n227\n00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:55.115\nHowever it still does present an issue\nif that system is compromised and\n\n228\n00:12:55.115 --> 00:12:57.730\ninfected my healthy\nproduction environment.\n\n229\n00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.400\nSo we go ahead and give it,\na medium assessment.\n\n230\n00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.390\nNow, how often are ARO,and we\ngonna be looking at algorithms\n\n231\n00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:11.560\na little bit later and acronyms here but\nARO stand for annual rate of occurrence.\n\n232\n00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:16.470\nSo ARO is going to be how often\ndoes if happen annually, okay so,\n\n233\n00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:22.070\nthis red is indicative\nof an extreme problem.\n\n234\n00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:26.279\nSo, people are trying to, if they know\nthat this operating system is unpatched,\n\n235\n00:13:26.279 --> 00:13:27.620\nit's vulnerable.\n\n236\n00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.390\nWell, they know those\nvulnerabilities exist.\n\n237\n00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:32.550\nSo they're not just gonna kick their feet\nup and relax, they're gonna go ahead and\n\n238\n00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.380\ntake advantage of any known vulnerability.\n\n239\n00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.640\nThat's easy work for them.\n\n240\n00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.010\nSo, we're gonna go ahead and\nassign that a higher level.\n\n241\n00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:45.010\nNow, if we look at\nthe cost of our controls.\n\n242\n00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:45.540\nWe'll go ahead and\n\n243\n00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:50.260\nput this at the mid level here because\nwe do need to sign a numerical.\n\n244\n00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.490\nUnfortunately, everything\ndoes boil back to money.\n\n245\n00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.400\nSo we always have to keep\nthat in our minds here.\n\n246\n00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.950\nAnd then, so\nby looking at the average here,\n\n247\n00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:00.570\nyou can go ahead and\nassign an overall risk.\n\n248\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.550\nSo certain companies might want to use\nnumbers to make it a little more factual\n\n249\n00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:08.535\nhere, but the concept is still the same,\nuntrained staff.\n\n250\n00:14:08.535 --> 00:14:10.105\nAgain, so if we look at these different,\n\n251\n00:14:10.105 --> 00:14:13.925\nthe impact of the untrained staff,\nour annual rate of occurrence.\n\n252\n00:14:13.925 --> 00:14:16.435\nYou know, how many help tickets are we\ngetting because people don't know how to\n\n253\n00:14:16.435 --> 00:14:19.955\nuse this piece of software within\nour organization, cost of controls.\n\n254\n00:14:19.955 --> 00:14:24.462\nWell, I'm gonna go ahead and give it a low\nlevel here because, I might just be paying\n\n255\n00:14:24.462 --> 00:14:28.352\nsomeone's salary to take their knowledge\nand create a PowerPoint presentation, and\n\n256\n00:14:28.352 --> 00:14:31.092\ngo ahead and\nhave some kind of departmental training.\n\n257\n00:14:31.092 --> 00:14:35.652\nOkay not too bad, there's still\ngiven overall medium assessment.\n\n258\n00:14:35.652 --> 00:14:39.027\nAnd then what if I have this system that's\nrunning without any kind of antiviral,\n\n259\n00:14:39.027 --> 00:14:43.180\nanti-malware, okay,\nno AV software running on that system.\n\n260\n00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.760\nSo we can go ahead and\nperform those same steps there.\n\n261\n00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.810\nSo that one's pretty basic.\n\n262\n00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.800\nLet me just find another\none to show you here.\n\n263\n00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.700\nGot too many windows opened\nthat's what's happening.\n\n264\n00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.180\nBut some other examples of matrices,\nif you guys can see that.\n\n265\n00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.640\nGo ahead and\nzoom in a little bit, if I can.\n\n266\n00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:11.990\nThere you go.\n\n267\n00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:15.960\nAll right, so we have a risk data and\nthey, here in this particular\n\n268\n00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.310\nvery another simpler example here\njust assigned numerical value.\n\n269\n00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.410\nYou can also use graphs.\n\n270\n00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:27.330\nTaking a lot of data,\na lot of information, is a little\n\n271\n00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:31.830\nmore profound when you can display it in\na presentable format like with graphs.\n\n272\n00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:36.310\nSo you're not gonna be quizzed on\nexactly what types of graphs these are.\n\n273\n00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.130\nBut I just wanna give you an idea\nof how you can use these certain\n\n274\n00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.040\ntools to your advantage here.\n\n275\n00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.270\nOkay, risk registers,\n\n276\n00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:46.140\nyou've got your power failure, the\nlikelihood of hurricane here in Florida.\n\n277\n00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:50.234\nYou also have to think about,\nyour geographical region.\n\n278\n00:15:50.234 --> 00:15:53.290\nSo, risk analysis is not\nthe easiest concepts.\n\n279\n00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:56.974\nIt's definitely one person job You\ndefinitely need to go ahead and\n\n280\n00:15:56.974 --> 00:15:57.907\nhave meetings.\n\n281\n00:15:57.907 --> 00:16:02.758\nGet buy in from a lot of departments\nwithin your organization to go ahead and\n\n282\n00:16:02.758 --> 00:16:04.200\nbegin this process.\n\n283\n00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.600\nSo, all right.\n\n284\n00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.330\nMoving along here, what phase were we on?\n\n285\n00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.853\nI think we were on, okay,\nour threat matrices.\n\n286\n00:16:13.853 --> 00:16:16.610\nMoving on to five, impact analysis.\n\n287\n00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:21.294\nSo like I was just talking your BIA,\nyour business impact analysis,\n\n288\n00:16:21.294 --> 00:16:23.730\nmay be a team collaboration there.\n\n289\n00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.820\nSo you have people, department heads\nfrom all over your organization.\n\n290\n00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.400\nBecause let's say I work in IT, okay?\n\n291\n00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:34.380\nI'm an IT manager and I know about IT but\n\n292\n00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.880\nI might not know all the important\nresources for the other departments.\n\n293\n00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.500\nSo I wanna make sure I have a good\nmix of everyone to go ahead and\n\n294\n00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.830\nhelp me brainstorm and come out with\nthe best, the best process there.\n\n295\n00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:49.380\nAnd then, lastly we're gonna go ahead and\ntake look at responses here.\n\n296\n00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:54.580\nSo we know these risks exist,\nhow are we going to deal with them?\n\n297\n00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:59.800\nOkay, so we have a couple of terms that we\ndo need to be familiar with for the exam.\n\n298\n00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.880\nSo let's take a look\nat our responses here.\n\n299\n00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.060\nNumber one is deterrence, okay.\n\n300\n00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:05.790\nWe could go ahead and\n\n301\n00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:10.770\ndeploy a counter measure that reduces\nexposure to a threat or a vulnerability.\n\n302\n00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:14.350\nNow when we think about this,\nour controls that can either make a risk\n\n303\n00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:18.740\nincident less likely, or less costly or\neven both, like we talked about.\n\n304\n00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:23.840\nSo what can I do to deter someone from\nbreaking into a building, Ronnie?\n\n305\n00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.670\n&gt;&gt; Well, you could do many things.\n\n306\n00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.620\nLocking their door would probably be,\n\n307\n00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.080\nafter hours, probably one of\nthe biggest ones you can do.\n\n308\n00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.800\nBut even during regular business\nhours keeping the door locked\n\n309\n00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.360\nindicates that they need to make some type\nof arrangement to be able to get in and\n\n310\n00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.420\nthat might be enough to deter them.\n\n311\n00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.450\nYou can even go a little bit further\nthan physical security here, and\n\n312\n00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:46.020\nactually start doing other things such as,\ntelling your customers\n\n313\n00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:50.160\nthat if they come on premise they will\nbe filmed, there will be, you know-.\n\n314\n00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.390\n&gt;&gt; Sign-ins.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sign-ins.\n\n315\n00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:52.670\n&gt;&gt; Lighting.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you name it.\n\n316\n00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:53.750\nThere's so many different things.\n\n317\n00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:54.880\n&gt;&gt; Security guards.\n\n318\n00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.640\nYeah, so you guys have already identified\nyour company that maybe you're in a bad\n\n319\n00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.150\nneighborhood.\n\n320\n00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:00.600\nOkay.\nOkay m aybe you just look at a historical\n\n321\n00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.680\ndate and say look we've had a lot of\nbreak-ins in this neighborhood so\n\n322\n00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.390\nlet's go ahead and\ntry to deter this from even happening.\n\n323\n00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.982\nOkay?\nNext, if we look at my screen,\n\n324\n00:18:10.982 --> 00:18:14.705\nhere we have mitigation or\nremediation responses.\n\n325\n00:18:14.705 --> 00:18:19.307\nThis is the overall process\nof reducing exposure to or\n\n326\n00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:21.874\nthe effects of risk factors.\n\n327\n00:18:21.874 --> 00:18:24.452\nSo this term mitigation is we're trying,\n\n328\n00:18:24.452 --> 00:18:29.190\nwe want to have the least amount of\nnegative impact to our organization there.\n\n329\n00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:34.580\nThat should be, let see mitigation,\n\n330\n00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.420\nthis is always gonna be\nin the back of our minds.\n\n331\n00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:40.210\nOkay, and then we have acceptance and\nretention.\n\n332\n00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:45.150\nNow, this one I don't really like\nthis sometimes because people\n\n333\n00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:49.440\nkind of look at it and say, I accept this\nrisk or maybe even sometimes ignore it.\n\n334\n00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.980\nBut that's not what we\nwant to have happen here.\n\n335\n00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:56.090\nSo risk acceptance is basically\nidentifying the risk,\n\n336\n00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:57.810\nyou're aware that it exists.\n\n337\n00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.730\nBut maybe this quarter you just\ncan't fit it into your budget.\n\n338\n00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:04.570\nYou can't purchase that new\nintrusion detection system or\n\n339\n00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:08.160\nwhatever it may be that you guys\nare looking at for the security control.\n\n340\n00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.970\nSo instead, what you could do is\njust pay it a little more mind and\n\n341\n00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:15.520\nkeep monitoring it a little bit more\nclosely for that particular risk there.\n\n342\n00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:21.940\nAnd avoidance means that you stop doing\nthe activity that is risk-bearing, and so\n\n343\n00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.540\nI put here like recalls.\n\n344\n00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.640\nSo, what was the name of\nthat phone just recently?\n\n345\n00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.940\nI don't if we're allowed to\nsay brands here on air but\n\n346\n00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:32.965\nthere's a particular phone that was\nhappening, it would explode, right?\n\n347\n00:19:32.965 --> 00:19:37.085\nSo maybe I'm an engineer and I've\nnoticed that, look, my boss wants me to\n\n348\n00:19:37.085 --> 00:19:41.465\ncome out with the newest, the latest and\ngreatest gadgets but I have a time crunch.\n\n349\n00:19:41.465 --> 00:19:45.617\nAnd maybe I haven't gone through all\nthe testing that really I should have, and\n\n350\n00:19:45.617 --> 00:19:49.887\nI push this product out because I wanna be\non the cutting edge next to my competitor.\n\n351\n00:19:49.887 --> 00:19:52.927\nAnd then all of a sudden\nmy product is blowing up.\n\n352\n00:19:52.927 --> 00:19:59.497\nSo avoidance, okay, means I have to\nlook at, from a business perspective,\n\n353\n00:19:59.497 --> 00:20:03.047\nlike I said it boils down to money, and\nsay, look, these lawsuits that could be\n\n354\n00:20:03.047 --> 00:20:07.580\ncoming in could potentially be more\ndetrimental to my organization than\n\n355\n00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:12.810\nany kind of revenue that may even\ncome from the sales of this device.\n\n356\n00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.580\nSo, let's just go ahead,\n\n357\n00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.960\ninsert foot in mouth, and\ntake these products off the shelf.\n\n358\n00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.440\nSo, any kind of activity\nthat could go ahead and\n\n359\n00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.350\npose that risk let's just go ahead and\navoid it.\n\n360\n00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:28.025\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we may find out that the idea of\navoidance here, Cherokee gives us a great\n\n361\n00:20:28.025 --> 00:20:33.390\nexample such as using the recall, but\nsometimes it may even stop us from\n\n362\n00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:38.300\nactually venturing out to try and\nperform any type of new activity.\n\n363\n00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.580\nIn other words, sticking with what\nour business model is going to\n\n364\n00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:46.380\nbe instead of venturing out a little bit\nfarther than what we are going to do.\n\n365\n00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.370\nSo, to give you an example of that,\nlet's talk about ITProTV for\n\n366\n00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:50.170\na moment here Cherokee.\n\n367\n00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:51.880\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; At the very beginning we\n\n368\n00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.650\nkind of knew what we were good in,\nokay, really just knew that.\n\n369\n00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:59.080\nAnd so we said all right all we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna stick to this idea of\n\n370\n00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.910\ncertification training cuz that's\nwhat we're really good in and\n\n371\n00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:03.630\nwe're doing a show on it right now.\n\n372\n00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:07.910\nBut the very fact is after a while we kind\nof realize we need to go a little bit\n\n373\n00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:12.210\nbeyond that and to actually get into the\narea of actually tech skills training and\n\n374\n00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.250\neven a little bit more in\nproject management and\n\n375\n00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.780\nwe start expanding out a little bit more.\n\n376\n00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.010\nBut at the very beginning,\n\n377\n00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:21.585\nwe avoided the risk of trying to\nbe more in that particular area.\n\n378\n00:21:21.585 --> 00:21:25.740\nIt's not because we weren't competent at\ndoing it but we felt like that at least in\n\n379\n00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.430\nwhat we were trying to do, the market\nthat we wanna hit, so we tended to avoid\n\n380\n00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:34.100\nany other market that we thought was\nnot going to be a big hit at the point.\n\n381\n00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.630\nSo you do tend to make\nbusiness decisions based\n\n382\n00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.730\noff of some of these strategies that\nyou actually already had as well.\n\n383\n00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:44.780\nAvoidance is a big one, acceptance\nsometimes like what you are mentioning,\n\n384\n00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.655\nsometimes you can't do anything to\nactually do that but accept the risk.\n\n385\n00:21:48.655 --> 00:21:53.991\nAnd one of the examples I always use\nis let's say that NASA tells us,\n\n386\n00:21:53.991 --> 00:21:58.430\nthere's a comet that is going\nto hit the ITProTV studios.\n\n387\n00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.889\nOkay, well there's nothing we can do,\nwe can't avoid it.\n\n388\n00:22:01.889 --> 00:22:04.479\nWe can't mitigate it, we can't deter it.\n\n389\n00:22:04.479 --> 00:22:07.280\nIt's going to hit, so\nwhat can you do except for\n\n390\n00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.533\nthe very fact of [CROSSTALK] accept it.\n\n391\n00:22:09.533 --> 00:22:10.417\n&gt;&gt; Accept it at that point.\n\n392\n00:22:10.417 --> 00:22:13.862\n&gt;&gt; Now, but hopefully though, with your\nprobability and your impact matrix,\n\n393\n00:22:13.862 --> 00:22:17.870\nwe're saying that the probability and\nthe impact of that happening, very tiny.\n\n394\n00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:21.280\nBut let's say that NASA says,\nit's gonna hit.\n\n395\n00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.410\nAnd then we ask when is it gonna hit.\n\n396\n00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:25.988\nWell, we think it's gonna hit in 2238.\n\n397\n00:22:25.988 --> 00:22:31.020\nWell it doesn't matter because I'm not\ngonna be around and Cherokee's still here\n\n398\n00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:34.860\ndoing shows she's not gonna be around\neither but let's say something like that.\n\n399\n00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.810\nSo, so sometimes you just\nhave to accept them as well.\n\n400\n00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:41.740\nBut these are the ways that we tend\nto deal with the majority okay.\n\n401\n00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.960\nSo Cherokee any others one\nthat we have to think about?\n\n402\n00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.170\n&gt;&gt; I think we have one more straggler\nhere we don't wanna leave that behind.\n\n403\n00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:50.880\nWe have transference and\nsharing down here at the bottom, and\n\n404\n00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.690\nthis is just a simple means of\nassigning risk to a third party.\n\n405\n00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.030\nThe biggest example or\n\n406\n00:22:56.030 --> 00:23:00.190\nthe most common example would\nprobably be an insurance company.\n\n407\n00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:04.010\nThe risk still exists it's\njust not your organization,\n\n408\n00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.470\nyou're offsetting it to that third entity.\n\n409\n00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:10.060\nSo you do need to be careful\nwhenever you're engaging and\n\n410\n00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:16.460\nyou're going into business with another\nentity because your customers, okay?\n\n411\n00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:21.770\nIn some way, their behaviors may also\naffect your overall customer experience.\n\n412\n00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:23.940\nSo you wanna be careful about who\nyou're going into business with.\n\n413\n00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.750\nBut ultimately, the risk still exists,\n\n414\n00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:30.540\nit's just offset with your transference or\nsharing.\n\n415\n00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.450\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee,\nwe've got actually some different types\n\n416\n00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:37.830\nof calculations we can do to help\nus to understand the idea of risks.\n\n417\n00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.920\nSo you wanna tell us about a few of\nthose different types of calculations?\n\n418\n00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.300\n&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah.\n\n419\n00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:45.540\nI know you have children Ronnie or\na child.\n\n420\n00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:46.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI have a child.\n\n421\n00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.185\n&gt;&gt; And I do so yes.\n\n422\n00:23:47.185 --> 00:23:48.851\nSo I always joke around and\n\n423\n00:23:48.851 --> 00:23:53.644\nsaid that I wish that there was a book\nto you know [LAUGH] a how-to, right?.\n\n424\n00:23:53.644 --> 00:23:56.424\nHow to make the best decision in life or\nyou don't even have to have kids.\n\n425\n00:23:56.424 --> 00:24:00.554\nJust a how-to in life, well, I think this\nis about as close as we get whenever we're\n\n426\n00:24:00.554 --> 00:24:02.253\ntalking about risk calculation.\n\n427\n00:24:02.253 --> 00:24:05.673\nWe don't have a book That's gonna\nbe giving us the proper answers to\n\n428\n00:24:05.673 --> 00:24:09.153\nthe decisions that we encounter,\nbut we do have some calculations,\n\n429\n00:24:09.153 --> 00:24:12.760\nsome tools that can help us make\nthe best decisions, to our knowledge.\n\n430\n00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.930\nSo, let's take a look at these here.\n\n431\n00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.200\n&gt;&gt; Wow, [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Before we get into the actual\n\n432\n00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.110\ncalculations, let's look\nat the terminology first.\n\n433\n00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:21.820\nI know this is a lot of acronyms.\n\n434\n00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.280\nWe actually, let's see.\n\n435\n00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.760\nWe might just get through the acronyms and\n\n436\n00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.210\ngo ahead on the actual\ncalculations next episode.\n\n437\n00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:29.600\nI don't wanna rush through this.\n\n438\n00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.330\nI wanna make sure you guys\nunderstand all of these terms.\n\n439\n00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:36.580\nBecause on the exam, they may be presented\nto you in just an acronym fashion.\n\n440\n00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.210\nSo let's go ahead and get started.\n\n441\n00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.930\n&gt;&gt; Sounds good.\n\n442\n00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.760\n&gt;&gt; The first one is your ALE, okay?\n\n443\n00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.820\nYour annual loss expectancy.\n\n444\n00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:44.990\nWrite that down.\n\n445\n00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:46.940\nPretty straight forward, okay?\n\n446\n00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:52.240\nWhat do you expect to lose annually from\na single occurrence or incidence, okay?\n\n447\n00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.910\nNext, we have MTTR.\n\n448\n00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:59.820\nNow, the mean time to repair.\n\n449\n00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:02.780\nMean, meaning average, okay.\n\n450\n00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:06.490\nSo, okay,\nI'm gonna with the IT Department here.\n\n451\n00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:09.040\nSo, your IT department\nshould have a good running\n\n452\n00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:14.490\nledger of all the different types\nof issues that they face, right?\n\n453\n00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.770\nMaybe you have a ticketing system\nin place which is great for\n\n454\n00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:20.300\nthis because once you have a base, okay?\n\n455\n00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:25.300\nOr all that historical data, you take that\ninformation and you use those numbers,\n\n456\n00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.990\nthose figures to come up with\nyour mean time to repair.\n\n457\n00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:35.060\nBy doing so, all right, we talked about\nbeing proactive instead of reactive,\n\n458\n00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:38.950\nif I know that a particular piece of\nequipment is nearing the end of it's life\n\n459\n00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:41.830\ncycle, then hey let me go ahead and\nswap it out during off\n\n460\n00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:45.450\nhours to prevent the possibility\nof a mechanical failure, right?\n\n461\n00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.360\nSo that's what we're looking at here,\nand that's where they're useful.\n\n462\n00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:53.020\nThis other term, MTTF mean time\nto failure, is very similar.\n\n463\n00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:56.490\nThe reason we have this\ntwo separate terms though,\n\n464\n00:25:56.490 --> 00:26:01.250\nis if I have a device that\nis not repairable on site.\n\n465\n00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.640\nThen I would used this\nterm mean time to failure.\n\n466\n00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.140\nIf I can't fix it,\nif I can't repair it, okay.\n\n467\n00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.720\nIf it's a server,\njust needs a new hard disk drive or\n\n468\n00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.190\nsomething like that, mean time to repair.\n\n469\n00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:12.210\nThat's an easy fix.\n\n470\n00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:15.270\nRight, so that's the difference\nbetween this two terms right there.\n\n471\n00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.050\nAnd then the meantime between failures.\n\n472\n00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:21.350\nSo if we look at the time\nin between these incidents\n\n473\n00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:22.740\nthat's what they are referring to here.\n\n474\n00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.188\nWe can go ahead and get an average and\n\n475\n00:26:24.188 --> 00:26:26.710\nsay okay, so what is the life\nspan of this particular device?\n\n476\n00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:31.550\nSo we can have our hot spears ready\nto go ahead and use wherever we need.\n\n477\n00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:34.960\nAnd your ARO, annual rate of occurrence.\n\n478\n00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:39.930\nSo, how often does this incident happen,\nokay?\n\n479\n00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:40.900\nPretty straight forward there.\n\n480\n00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:45.280\nAnd your SLE, single loss of expectancy.\n\n481\n00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:49.891\nSo, during that particular event,\nwhat can we expect to lose?\n\n482\n00:26:49.891 --> 00:26:52.160\nOkay, remember,\nloss can be a number of things.\n\n483\n00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.360\nIt could be qualitative or\nit could be quantitative, so\n\n484\n00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:00.070\nwe'll talk about that a little\nbit later and your RPO.\n\n485\n00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:03.790\nYour RPO is your recovery\npoint object objective.\n\n486\n00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.832\nNow, let's think about this for a second.\n\n487\n00:27:06.832 --> 00:27:12.090\nSome companies can be a little\nmore they bounce back, okay.\n\n488\n00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:13.726\nSome companies not so much and\n\n489\n00:27:13.726 --> 00:27:16.700\nit also depends on what data\nis your actually losing.\n\n490\n00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.637\nSo, let say, I'm a sales person and\n\n491\n00:27:20.637 --> 00:27:24.820\nI have a list of perspective clients.\n\n492\n00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.150\nAnd I've contacted them.\n\n493\n00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:29.090\nAnd I go ahead and\nkeep notes of our conversations.\n\n494\n00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:32.710\nSo, maybe within the last 24 hours,\nI have a server fail and and\n\n495\n00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:36.390\nwiped out all my notes,\nmy conversations for the last 24 hours.\n\n496\n00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:39.230\nBut I might be able to piece\nthat back together and\n\n497\n00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:42.270\nremember those conversations and\nbe good to go.\n\n498\n00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:49.140\nHowever, if the data inside of my web\nserver were to fail and the back end\n\n499\n00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:53.280\non the data side like my SQL Server for\nany kind of web orders that were placed.\n\n500\n00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.380\nSo for the past 24 hours I lose,\n\n501\n00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:58.670\nmaybe I'm a bigger company like\nAmazon how could that happen right?\n\n502\n00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:01.240\nI lost all the orders for\nthe last 24 hours.\n\n503\n00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:05.886\nSo your RPO is going to be\nthat recovery point objective\n\n504\n00:28:05.886 --> 00:28:09.828\nsaying how much can my\ncompany really suffer?\n\n505\n00:28:09.828 --> 00:28:11.560\nSo, our backups.\n\n506\n00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.731\nMost companies go ahead and\nperform backups,\n\n507\n00:28:13.731 --> 00:28:16.290\nthey should be anyways on a daily basis.\n\n508\n00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:24.220\nSo maybe on Friday at 5:30 PM I go\nahead and run my company backups, okay.\n\n509\n00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.390\nSo.\n\n510\n00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:28.350\nOver the weekend come Monday morning\nI found some hardware failed\n\n511\n00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:31.640\nwell in this particular situation\nmy recovery point objective\n\n512\n00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.770\nwould be that last known good backup here.\n\n513\n00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:40.310\nAnd your RTO recovery time objective\nwould be that window for how\n\n514\n00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:45.440\nlong does it take to go ahead and restore\nthat backup from last Friday, okay.\n\n515\n00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:50.760\nAnd then exposure factor is going to\nbe a percentage of the loss there.\n\n516\n00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:55.860\nSo, basically your exposure\nfactor would be a if I have,\n\n517\n00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:58.530\nthis one's a little tricky here.\n\n518\n00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:01.820\nIt falls under that\ncategory of quantitative.\n\n519\n00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:06.120\nIf I lose my laptop and it has no\ncompany data on it I lose a 100% or\n\n520\n00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.640\nwhatever market value would be for that.\n\n521\n00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.640\nHowever if we have\nsensitive customer data or\n\n522\n00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.980\nemployee information on this laptop It\ncould be a little bit different but\n\n523\n00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:18.480\nwe'll take a look at that whenever we\nlook at quantitative versus qualitative.\n\n524\n00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.000\nSo I think that about does it on time,\nas long as we're familiar\n\n525\n00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.610\nwith these terms then we can use that to\ngo ahead and perform these calculations.\n\n526\n00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:29.740\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee\nwell thank you again for\n\n527\n00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.545\nhelping us to understand a little\nbit more about these risk concepts.\n\n528\n00:29:32.545 --> 00:29:36.250\nRemember that we've actually taken\na look at the basic definition of risks\n\n529\n00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:38.870\nas well as the different\ntypes that we tend to see.\n\n530\n00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:42.390\nWe've also talked about the control types\nthat we also have as well as the risk\n\n531\n00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:47.430\nanalysis phase that we need to at least\nunderstand as a security professional.\n\n532\n00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:51.260\nAll of this comes together at least at the\nintroduction for us, and then, of course,\n\n533\n00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.790\nthe risk calculations that we're gonna\nend up seeing in another episode.\n\n534\n00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:57.680\nSo that means you wanna stay tuned\nright here as we continue on and\n\n535\n00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:02.110\nsee more of those to actually\nget a little bit more in depth\n\n536\n00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:05.390\nabout those different types of analysis\nthat we'll actually be able to do as well.\n\n537\n00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:09.140\nAll right, well that's a great\nplace to end this episode then.\n\n538\n00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.990\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n539\n00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:14.130\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n540\n00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:16.904\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore Comp

00:00:08.401\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:12.453\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ItProTv.\n\n5\n00:00:12.453 --> 00:00:15.417\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ItProTv.\n\n6\n00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:16.974\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\n\n7\n00:00:16.974 --> 00:00:19.830\ntoday we're talking a look\nat Comp Tia Security Plus.\n\n8\n00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.080\nWe're specifically gonna be addressing\nthe ideas here of risk concepts.\n\n9\n00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.960\nWe've already taken a look in part\none where we've got the basic\n\n10\n00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.980\nintroductory concepts down.\n\n11\n00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.611\nAnd now with us in our studio is Cherokee\nBoose, to help us with well some of\n\n12\n00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:35.481\nthe additional risk concepts\nthat we have to understand,\n\n13\n00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:38.958\nespecially in dealing with some of\nthe analysis and formulas as well.\n\n14\n00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:42.456\nSo, Cherokee, welcome back to\nour studios as we continue on.\n\n15\n00:00:42.456 --> 00:00:43.614\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n16\n00:00:43.614 --> 00:00:46.580\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, so,\nwhat do we need to actually understand?\n\n17\n00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.740\nWe've already gone over kind of the very\nbasics, and for us in Security Plus,\n\n18\n00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.070\nthat's usually enough.\n\n19\n00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.850\nBut overall though, there's some specific\nthings that we really need to address.\n\n20\n00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.670\nAnd now we get into that realm that I'm\ngonna be really bad at which is gonna\n\n21\n00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.550\nbe math.\n\n22\n00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.890\nSo Cherokee, where are we going to begin?\n\n23\n00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.160\n&gt;&gt; Sure, in the previous episodes,\nwe looked at the actual acronyms and\n\n24\n00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.710\nexplained what these terms meant.\n\n25\n00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.780\nSo now, let's go ahead and\nuse those acronyms in these equations.\n\n26\n00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.476\nSo, if you wanna go ahead and take a look\nat my screen, you can go ahead and\n\n27\n00:01:11.476 --> 00:01:12.020\nstart there.\n\n28\n00:01:13.891 --> 00:01:17.367\nAll right, so in this first column,\nwe have quantitative,\n\n29\n00:01:17.367 --> 00:01:22.190\nfirst we need to understand quantitative\nversus qualitative analysis.\n\n30\n00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.060\nSo quantitative,\nif you think of the word quantity.\n\n31\n00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.070\nLet's say we have pieces of candy.\n\n32\n00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.910\nIt's Halloween, so we get candy.\n\n33\n00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.110\nSo, the kids sit on the floor, and\nthey count out all their pieces of candy.\n\n34\n00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.070\nWhat's the quantity of candy?\n\n35\n00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.810\nIt's a number.\n\n36\n00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.380\nIt's a numerical value.\n\n37\n00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.970\nSo maybe that'll help you\nremember that numbers, facts,\n\n38\n00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.250\nare associated with quantitative analysis.\n\n39\n00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.770\nIf we look at qualitative,\nit's a little bit tricky.\n\n40\n00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.420\nRonnie, have you ever\nbeen through the process\n\n41\n00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.000\nof having to choose some kind of insurance\nfor your company, like health insurance,\n\n42\n00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.550\nlife insurance, things like that?\n\n43\n00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we all have,\nin any company we worked for,\n\n44\n00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.990\nthere's been benefits involved.\n\n45\n00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.670\n&gt;&gt; You had to make some type of choice\non what you'd done there, sure.\n\n46\n00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.295\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n47\n00:02:05.295 --> 00:02:09.130\n[COUGH] Excuse me, and\nsometimes you'll even,\n\n48\n00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.080\nlet's say someone were to\nbe injured at work, right?\n\n49\n00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.485\nSo, part of that process would be if you\nwere permanently disabled to determine\n\n50\n00:02:16.485 --> 00:02:22.040\nthe, any kind of payout from\nthat particular injury.\n\n51\n00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.670\nAnd what do you think\nwould be more expensive?\n\n52\n00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.880\nLosing a thumb, or losing a pinky?\n\n53\n00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.000\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n54\n00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.090\nI would assume losing a thumb.\n\n55\n00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.520\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, okay?\n\n56\n00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.420\nAnd so, for these insurance reps, a lot of\nthem might even know the exact amounts.\n\n57\n00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.130\nI have no clue what it would be.\n\n58\n00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.140\nBut, the process of coming\nup with a numerical value,\n\n59\n00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.680\nwith something that\ndoesn't have a price tag.\n\n60\n00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.290\nTag, right, like our thumb,\nyou don't buy a thumb at the store.\n\n61\n00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.810\nWe don't have a price tag for that.\n\n62\n00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.050\nSo, how do we, what's the process for\nassigning a numerical value to it?\n\n63\n00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.840\nSo, that's qualitative analysis,\n\n64\n00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.040\nis you kind of have to attach\na numerical value and some method, okay?\n\n65\n00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.425\nSome methodology so, if we look at\nthe quantitative, it's a little easier.\n\n66\n00:03:02.425 --> 00:03:05.330\nIt's numbers, it's factual,\nit's there in black and white.\n\n67\n00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.010\nWe can use our equations here, okay?\n\n68\n00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.350\nSo, the first equation that we\nlooked at is our exposure factor,\n\n69\n00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.470\nwhich is the percentage of the loss there,\n\n70\n00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.100\ntimes the actual value of the asset,\nthe asset value.\n\n71\n00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.780\nSo, we times those to remultiply them\ntogether, and that's gonna go ahead and\n\n72\n00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.741\ngive us our SLE, or\nsingle-loss expectancy, okay?\n\n73\n00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:31.880\nNow, whenever we take our\nsingle loss expectancy\n\n74\n00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.340\ntimes the annual rate of occurrence,\nthat'll go ahead and give us our ALE.\n\n75\n00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.030\nOkay, so our SLE times our Our ALE,\nor ARO gives us our ALE.\n\n76\n00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.540\nI'll switch over to the other slide.\n\n77\n00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.420\nWe'll do an example.\n\n78\n00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.620\nI know,\nall these acronyms are a little crazy, but\n\n79\n00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.860\nwe'll go through that together, I promise.\n\n80\n00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.210\nYeah, and your EF, your exposure factor,\nis just the percentage of the loss there.\n\n81\n00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.700\nIf I had any kind of depreciation,\nI would need to go ahead and\n\n82\n00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.650\ninclude that, especially if I were making\nany kind of insurance claims, or just for\n\n83\n00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.950\nthe overall documentation for\nmy organization.\n\n84\n00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.260\nSo, qualitative, okay.\n\n85\n00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.100\nSo Ronnie, if you take a look at this\none over here, we have Scenarios,\n\n86\n00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.240\nBrainstorming, Storyboarding,\nValue Judgement,\n\n87\n00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.090\nI don't know if that makes\na little bit of sense to you.\n\n88\n00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.730\nIn my opinion, I feel that\nqualitative is the easiest method,\n\n89\n00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.130\nbut quantitative, excuse me,\nquantitative is the easiest method, but\n\n90\n00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.500\nqualitative is a little trickier.\n\n91\n00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.670\n&gt;&gt; All right, so, Cherokee,\nI'm going to go backward, and\n\n92\n00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.750\nthe reason why is what I told you before,\nis because for me, the math is harder.\n\n93\n00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.770\nOkay, so, I can come up with scenarios.\n\n94\n00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.430\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n\n95\n00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.360\n&gt;&gt; I can talk about the different\nstoryboards that can actually occur, but\n\n96\n00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.640\nfor me, yeah, having to actually\nmultiply numbers together, and\n\n97\n00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.070\nthen having to do percents and\nmultiply those and\n\n98\n00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.530\nhaving to remember formulas,\na little bit more difficult.\n\n99\n00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.140\nBut I'm not saying Cherokee's wrong,\n\n100\n00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.200\nbut everybody tends to look at it\na little bit differently, too.\n\n101\n00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.720\nSo, when you do something like this\nin terms of the quantitative method,\n\n102\n00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.740\nremember, you do need sometimes,\nespecially depending on the details here.\n\n103\n00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.320\nYou might have to have\na system of formulas,\n\n104\n00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.510\nlike what Cherokee's showing you.\n\n105\n00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.450\nBut whereas, in the type of qualitative\nanalysis, you really don't need a lot of\n\n106\n00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.840\nspecial tools, you need a little bit\nmore in terms of imagination, and\n\n107\n00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.090\nin terms of being able to\nwork through scenarios.\n\n108\n00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.090\nBut it doesn't require the idea of\nme memorizing special formulas,\n\n109\n00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.500\nand I'd love to tell you I'm great at\nthat, but once you add in formulas, and\n\n110\n00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.700\nyou add in numbers, I am a complete mess.\n\n111\n00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.136\nSo, that's why I would find it,\nat least for me,\n\n112\n00:05:31.136 --> 00:05:33.804\na little bit easier on\nthe qualitative side and stuff.\n\n113\n00:05:33.804 --> 00:05:36.171\n&gt;&gt; Okay,\nwe'll keep it pretty basic here then.\n\n114\n00:05:36.171 --> 00:05:38.572\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you wanna take a look at my screen,\n\n115\n00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:39.659\nI've got an example.\n\n116\n00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:41.515\nI'll try, we'll try here.\n\n117\n00:05:41.515 --> 00:05:42.250\n&gt;&gt; There you go.\n\n118\n00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.150\n&gt;&gt; Okay, like I said on the previous\nslide, our ARO * SLE = ALE.\n\n119\n00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.220\nSo the annual rate of occurrence, okay?\n\n120\n00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.810\nHow many times does this\nincident occur annually,\n\n121\n00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.760\ntimes the single loss expectancy?\n\n122\n00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.990\nSo, what is my organization\nlosing per incident?\n\n123\n00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.250\nMultiply them together,\nI get my annual loss expectancy, okay.\n\n124\n00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.030\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Sounds easy enough, right?\n\n125\n00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.600\nSo, if we think back to our assets,\nin the previous episode,\n\n126\n00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.150\nwe identified assets as being tangible,\neven intangible assets.\n\n127\n00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.010\nSo our employees, a lot of companies\ncannot continue production, or continue to\n\n128\n00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.420\nreceive any kind of revenue if they lose\na certain percent of your staff, right?\n\n129\n00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.220\nSo, here at ITProTV we currently\nhave how many employees?\n\n130\n00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.720\n&gt;&gt; A lot.\n&gt;&gt; 26?\n\n131\n00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know.\n\n132\n00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.165\n&gt;&gt; I think?\nSo, okay-\n\n133\n00:06:31.165 --> 00:06:31.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n134\n00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.510\n&gt;&gt; That's what-\n\n135\n00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, I'm with you.\n\n136\n00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.380\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's stick with 26.\n\n137\n00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.700\nI know it's not an even number,\nbut we'll try to make it work.\n\n138\n00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:44.340\nNow, Ronnie, let's just go ahead and say\nthat there's some kind of viral outbreak,\n\n139\n00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.270\nand people are getting sick,\nmaybe the swine flu, or whatever, right?\n\n140\n00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.110\nSo maybe an option for\nsecurity control for\n\n141\n00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.990\nthat organization, were to go ahead and\nbringing in some kind of health clinic,\n\n142\n00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.240\nto go ahead and distribute\nimmunizations within that organization.\n\n143\n00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.640\nI'm not really sure about the pricing in\nall different areas for immunizations, but\n\n144\n00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.690\nlet's just pick a number,\nlike 20, and say hey, $20 a shot,\n\n145\n00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.270\nper employee for an immunization for\nthis particular strain of virus.\n\n146\n00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.320\nAll right, so if we look at $20,\n\n147\n00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.590\nthen I guess I could go ahead and\ntype this up for us, let's try.\n\n148\n00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.110\nAll right, so we have $20,\nand then we'll go ahead and\n\n149\n00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.740\nmultiply that by our 26 employees.\n\n150\n00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:30.460\nIt should give us a total cost of $520 for\nthose immunizations.\n\n151\n00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.792\nSo, there might be some kind of labor\ninvolved for those people who have to\n\n152\n00:07:33.792 --> 00:07:37.527\nadminister it, but, let's just go ahead\nand leave it there at $520 for now.\n\n153\n00:07:37.527 --> 00:07:42.833\nIf I look at, perhaps,\nlet's say Ronnie gets paid $20 and hour.\n\n154\n00:07:42.833 --> 00:07:45.432\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; The average downtime for\n\n155\n00:07:45.432 --> 00:07:52.589\nsomeone who has been getting this virus\nis a sick, of one week of recovery, okay?\n\n156\n00:07:52.589 --> 00:07:56.830\nSo, let's say they work a normal\nwork week of 40 hours a week.\n\n157\n00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.104\nSo, if we go ahead and\ntake a look at that, all right?\n\n158\n00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:04.576\nThat employee may get paid $800 a week,\nbut let's say that that\n\n159\n00:08:04.576 --> 00:08:09.700\nemployee generates three times as much for\nthe revenue of the company.\n\n160\n00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.450\nSo if we look at those kind of figures,\n\n161\n00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.340\nwe can kinda put it in perspective\nto make the best decisions.\n\n162\n00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:21.910\nSo, let's just say, all right,\nwe've got our numbers here and\n\n163\n00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:28.380\nthen we look at 20 by 26,\n$520 in the grand scheme of things.\n\n164\n00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.454\nIf we've got $2400 for\n\n165\n00:08:31.454 --> 00:08:35.220\nthe revenue for that individual that\nthey're pulling into that company.\n\n166\n00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.805\nLet's say ten employees fell ill.\n\n167\n00:08:38.805 --> 00:08:41.973\nOkay, so $2400 x 10.\n\n168\n00:08:41.973 --> 00:08:46.729\nSo now we're talking $24,000 versus $520.\n\n169\n00:08:46.729 --> 00:08:52.360\nSo instead of just flying by the seat of\nyour pants and making these calls, looking\n\n170\n00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:58.770\nat some mathematical calculations can\nhelp you make the best educated decision.\n\n171\n00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.740\nSo, all right.\n\n172\n00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.420\nMoving along, make sense?\n\n173\n00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.840\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\nMade great sense.\n\n174\n00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.200\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n175\n00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:11.740\nSo when it comes to purchasing\nthose immunizations,\n\n176\n00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.225\nwe need to think about categories.\n\n177\n00:09:13.225 --> 00:09:15.970\nI told you guys Security Plus\nhas a lot of categories,\n\n178\n00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:21.610\nso that immunization would be a type of\ncontrol, okay, that we have implemented.\n\n179\n00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:26.190\nThere are three basic control\ncategories that we have here.\n\n180\n00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.980\nNumber one, being technical.\n\n181\n00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.160\nTechnical, this control is\nimplemented as a system.\n\n182\n00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.335\nIt could be hardware, software,\na firmware, examples would be firewalls,\n\n183\n00:09:37.335 --> 00:09:41.950\nanti-virus software,\noperating system access control models.\n\n184\n00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.040\nThese are going to be technical controls,\nall right?\n\n185\n00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.470\nAnd so you can see here.\n\n186\n00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:49.410\nThis is the fun stuff, this what\nthe IT department gets their hands in.\n\n187\n00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.230\nAnd they are hardening their servers.\n\n188\n00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.690\nThey are doing everything they\ncan from a technical standpoint.\n\n189\n00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.630\nNext we have operational or\nadministrative and these controls\n\n190\n00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:04.790\nare implemented primarily by people within\nthe organization, rather than systems.\n\n191\n00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.470\nLike security guards\nimplementing training programs.\n\n192\n00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:09.830\nOkay?\nThese are operational or\n\n193\n00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.230\nadministrative security controls.\n\n194\n00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.530\nNext, we have management.\n\n195\n00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:18.573\nThis is where the control gives oversight\nof the information systems like risk\n\n196\n00:10:18.573 --> 00:10:20.800\nidentification methods and tools.\n\n197\n00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.340\nSo this is might be upper management,\nokay, going ahead and\n\n198\n00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.322\nimplementing these types of controls.\n\n199\n00:10:27.322 --> 00:10:32.160\nBut eventually they can make decisions,\nmodels, policies that will go ahead and\n\n200\n00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.890\ntrickle down to the technical\ncontrols as well.\n\n201\n00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:39.270\nSo those are our three categories that we\nneed to know for this certification exam.\n\n202\n00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.850\nI do wanna show you some\nadditional families\n\n203\n00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.110\nthat NIST published in\ntheir special publication.\n\n204\n00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.083\nOoh, what publication was this one?\n\n205\n00:10:48.824 --> 00:10:51.780\nI'll go ahead and put the link\nin the show notes for you guys.\n\n206\n00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.800\nThe good news is, we don't need to know\nall of our families that we see here.\n\n207\n00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.310\nBut I did want to show you this so\nyou can kind of mentally segregate\n\n208\n00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:05.510\nthe different types of categories\nthat exist in the security field.\n\n209\n00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:09.220\nSo access control would be\na type of technical control.\n\n210\n00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.180\nAwareness and training would fall\nunder the category of operational.\n\n211\n00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.860\nAnd you can just kinda see\nwhere we're going with that.\n\n212\n00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.160\nBut you can take a deep breath,\nwe don't have to memorize all of these.\n\n213\n00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.085\nWe only have three categories that\nwe need to know for this exam.\n\n214\n00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:29.210\nAll right, and\nnext up it looks like we have policies.\n\n215\n00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.710\nYay.\n\n216\n00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.900\nOkay.\nIf we take a look at this list,\n\n217\n00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.260\nwe can see that security\npolicy is noted here up top.\n\n218\n00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.930\nThis is the most important\npolicy within your organization.\n\n219\n00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:44.900\nYour corporate security policy should\nclearly define what it is you're going\n\n220\n00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.814\nto be protecting,\nhow you're going to be protecting it, and\n\n221\n00:11:48.814 --> 00:11:52.352\nwhat you're not going to be protecting,\nto go ahead and\n\n222\n00:11:52.352 --> 00:11:57.125\njust show that your company is putting\nforth an effort to provide due care.\n\n223\n00:11:59.305 --> 00:12:05.125\nYour security policy needs to be accepted\nby everyone within the organization.\n\n224\n00:12:05.125 --> 00:12:10.190\nThis is something that you\nhear lead by example, right?\n\n225\n00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:14.180\nAnd this is very, very true when\nit comes to your security policy.\n\n226\n00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.460\nIt's not a one person job.\n\n227\n00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:21.450\nYou might even have to go ahead and\npresent your security policy in\n\n228\n00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.840\nfront of a legal team to make sure you're\nnot violating any kind of regulatory or\n\n229\n00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.540\ngeographical laws.\n\n230\n00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.580\nSo it's definitely a big project there.\n\n231\n00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:40.330\nSans, if we go ahead and take a look here,\noffers some basic security templates.\n\n232\n00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.970\nIt's a good place to start if\nyou've never created one before but\n\n233\n00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:47.920\nyou're not just gonna be able to use the\nboiler plate template from the website.\n\n234\n00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:53.020\nEach security policy has to be very\nunique to that individual organization.\n\n235\n00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.580\nSo this is just a good place to start and\nthis link is in the show notes so\n\n236\n00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.650\nthat you guys could go ahead and\n\n237\n00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:00.830\ntake a look at that if you've never had to\ngo ahead and create one, you're not alone.\n\n238\n00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:05.790\nAnd next up, we have a privacy policy.\n\n239\n00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.810\nThis is important and these additional\npolicies can be added as addendum's\n\n240\n00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:14.392\nonto your security policy or they could\nbe included, but here wants us to break\n\n241\n00:13:14.392 --> 00:13:19.240\nthem down so you can clearly understand\nwhat should be included under these terms.\n\n242\n00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.090\nSo for your privacy policy,\nwhether this policy is\n\n243\n00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:28.380\nwith your customers or your employees,\nyou really should define both ends of\n\n244\n00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:33.170\nthe spectrum as to what you're\ndoing to protect communications,\n\n245\n00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.870\ncustomer data, any kind of implied\npolicy that you have there.\n\n246\n00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:41.790\nAnd remember, for instance,\nyou're in Florida recording someone, okay,\n\n247\n00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.770\nwithout their consent,\ntelephone calls and so\n\n248\n00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.880\nforth, you have to go ahead and\nget that ahead of time.\n\n249\n00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.040\nOtherwise, it could be a felony,\n\n250\n00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.860\nso we don't want to overstep\nany of those legal boundaries.\n\n251\n00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.440\nWe want to make sure we're being\nas comprehensive as possible, but\n\n252\n00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.590\nwe don't want to go ahead and\nput ourselves into that situation either.\n\n253\n00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:03.190\nNext, we have our acceptable use policy,\nyour AUP.\n\n254\n00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:07.740\nSo, this policy is just going\nto be defining the guidelines of\n\n255\n00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:12.870\nwhat you can do with their equipment,\ntheir network usage.\n\n256\n00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:17.460\nSo ultimately as network admins,\nit's their responsibility for\n\n257\n00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.810\nwhat transpires within that network.\n\n258\n00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:23.120\nSo they're gonna need to have some kind\nof boundaries and rules set forth.\n\n259\n00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:28.235\nSo by signing these documents,\nyou're agreeing to those terms, okay.\n\n260\n00:14:28.235 --> 00:14:30.365\nI'm not gonna be using any kind of,\n\n261\n00:14:30.365 --> 00:14:32.425\nnot going to any kind of\nnon-approved websites.\n\n262\n00:14:32.425 --> 00:14:35.975\nSo I'm not gonna be checking my\nFacebook throughout the day.\n\n263\n00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:38.776\nThings like that,\nit just depends on your organization.\n\n264\n00:14:40.567 --> 00:14:44.977\nThe next policy we have here\nis mandatory vacations.\n\n265\n00:14:44.977 --> 00:14:50.947\nSo ITProTV doesn't implement that but\nwe do have a suggestion box.\n\n266\n00:14:50.947 --> 00:14:56.547\nA mandatory vacation,\nI've never had to have that.\n\n267\n00:14:56.547 --> 00:14:59.397\nGo ahead and\nbe assigned a mandatory vacation.\n\n268\n00:14:59.397 --> 00:15:01.518\nHave you Ronny?\n\n269\n00:15:01.518 --> 00:15:02.760\n&gt;&gt; I probably have.\n\n270\n00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.427\n[LAUGH] Yeah, no,\nthe idea of mandatory vacations, though,\n\n271\n00:15:06.427 --> 00:15:10.517\nthis is something that ends of\nhappening for individuals that work,\n\n272\n00:15:10.517 --> 00:15:13.209\nespecially in a high pressure environment.\n\n273\n00:15:13.209 --> 00:15:16.731\nA lot of times they feel like that they\nare the only individuals that can be\n\n274\n00:15:16.731 --> 00:15:18.116\ncounted on, to that point,\n\n275\n00:15:18.116 --> 00:15:22.220\nwhere they don't ever leave their\nparticular job to even take a vacation.\n\n276\n00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:26.270\nNow for the company that's great, because\nit means that they never leave their job.\n\n277\n00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:26.950\n&gt;&gt; Good and bad.\n\n278\n00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.880\n&gt;&gt; But at the same time, it can be bad,\n\n279\n00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.800\nbecause then a lot of times more\nthings can go on and personality\n\n280\n00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.590\nissues that can end up happening when\nthe person is just stressed out too much.\n\n281\n00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:43.612\nSo instead, what also needs to happen\nis this idea of a mandatory vacation,\n\n282\n00:15:43.612 --> 00:15:46.749\nin which you require\nthe employee to go ahead and\n\n283\n00:15:46.749 --> 00:15:50.842\ntake the vacation time that\nthey're actually going to have.\n\n284\n00:15:50.842 --> 00:15:54.668\nAnd the reason why you do that is because\nthey need to know that one, first of all,\n\n285\n00:15:54.668 --> 00:15:58.328\nthat the company can survive without them\nas much as they don't want people to\n\n286\n00:15:58.328 --> 00:15:59.477\nsurvive without them.\n\n287\n00:15:59.477 --> 00:16:01.114\n&gt;&gt; We don't want anyone hurt, but just.\n\n288\n00:16:01.114 --> 00:16:02.340\n&gt;&gt; Um-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Accidents happen, right?\n\n289\n00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.598\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n&gt;&gt; So I want to make sure that.\n\n290\n00:16:03.598 --> 00:16:04.896\nWe're able to go ahead and\n\n291\n00:16:04.896 --> 00:16:07.909\nfunction as an organization in\ncase that person is missing.\n\n292\n00:16:07.909 --> 00:16:09.558\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then the same thing, right,\n\n293\n00:16:09.558 --> 00:16:12.990\nthey know that they're not leaving\nanybody in the lurch at the same time.\n\n294\n00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.860\nA lot of people feel a little bit\nmore insecure about their job when\n\n295\n00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.300\nthey realize that the company\ncan go on without them.\n\n296\n00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.987\nBut it is something that\nthey need to realize,\n\n297\n00:16:19.987 --> 00:16:22.670\nit's something that the company\nalso needs to realize as well.\n\n298\n00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:26.940\nThe other thing about mandatory vacations\nthat really is good in terms of security\n\n299\n00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.710\nIs that it gives us\na chance to actually review\n\n300\n00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:33.470\nsome of the different things that can\nhappen without that person being there.\n\n301\n00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.780\nSo if there is any, hopefully it's\nnot because of security incident,\n\n302\n00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:40.190\nbut even with security policies,\nthey can actually review and\n\n303\n00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:41.910\nfigure out what else is happening.\n\n304\n00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.705\nSo mandatory vacations are good.\n&gt;&gt; Auditing.\n\n305\n00:16:43.705 --> 00:16:45.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, auditing.\n&gt;&gt; Perfect times for audits, yeah.\n\n306\n00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.400\n&gt;&gt; Those are kind of some of the things.\n\n307\n00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.540\nBut yeah, mandatory vacations, they can\nbe for good things as well as bad things.\n\n308\n00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.700\nSometimes you do have to take a vacation\nbecause you have been over stressed out\n\n309\n00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.430\nand it may be where your employer\ncomes and tells you, hey Ronnie.\n\n310\n00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:00.438\nYou got to head out the door for\na week, cuz you're about to explode.\n\n311\n00:17:00.438 --> 00:17:03.754\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it might not be any,\nlike a discretionary vacation.\n\n312\n00:17:03.754 --> 00:17:07.118\nIt might just be part of a regulatory\ncompliance there, just for\n\n313\n00:17:07.118 --> 00:17:08.250\nauditing purposes.\n\n314\n00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.040\nTo make sure that there's not any kind\nof internal fraud or anything going on,\n\n315\n00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.940\nnot that we think Ronnie is\ndoing anything wrong here.\n\n316\n00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:14.860\nWe just [LAUGH]-\n&gt;&gt; Who knows?\n\n317\n00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.667\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, next up on our list,\n\n318\n00:17:17.667 --> 00:17:19.553\nwe have job rotation.\n\n319\n00:17:19.553 --> 00:17:23.825\nAnd that kinda goes with what we were\ntalking about before with the mandatory\n\n320\n00:17:23.825 --> 00:17:26.370\nvacation, as well as separation of duties.\n\n321\n00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:30.780\nThese topics are closely related\nbecause we don't wanna give, and\n\n322\n00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.370\nI'm sure you guys and\n\n323\n00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:37.780\nladies out there have experienced at least\none person out in the workforce that wants\n\n324\n00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:42.020\nto have that job security because they\ndon't wanna tell anyone else how to do it.\n\n325\n00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.810\nThey wanna have that full control so\nthat they're not gonna get fired, right?\n\n326\n00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:47.247\nSome people do have that mindset.\n\n327\n00:17:47.247 --> 00:17:49.950\nBut that's not the right mindset\nthat we should have here.\n\n328\n00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.250\nWe wanna have a job rotation.\n\n329\n00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:56.810\nNumber one, it makes you as an employee,\nyou're gonna be just a more beneficial\n\n330\n00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:00.600\nemployee although a more well-rounded,\nokay, flexible, I should say.\n\n331\n00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.176\nBecause you're getting trained in other\ndepartments or fields or just positions,\n\n332\n00:18:04.176 --> 00:18:05.530\ndifferent tasks.\n\n333\n00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:09.540\nSo that's job rotation, and\nthen separation of duties.\n\n334\n00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.550\nWe'll see this a lot throughout\nSecurity+ because you always wanna be\n\n335\n00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:17.242\nvery translucent, okay, with security.\n\n336\n00:18:17.242 --> 00:18:18.970\nYou wanna make sure you're letting people,\n\n337\n00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:20.820\nespecially if you're in the IT department,\nright.\n\n338\n00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.823\nWe don't keep our password lists, we're\ngonna be telling people what we're dong so\n\n339\n00:18:24.823 --> 00:18:25.498\nthey can't.\n\n340\n00:18:25.498 --> 00:18:29.506\nThe person who is creating the backups,\nall right, is gonna be different from\n\n341\n00:18:29.506 --> 00:18:32.990\nthe individual who is implementing\nthe restoration process.\n\n342\n00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.600\nSo that coming back, someone can't say\nI think Ronnie tried to cover someone's\n\n343\n00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:40.418\ntracks because he had his hands\nin both of those processes.\n\n344\n00:18:40.418 --> 00:18:44.230\nSo we wanna take a look at these terms and\njust acknowledge them.\n\n345\n00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.600\nJob rotation, separation of duty and\n\n346\n00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.280\nmandatory vacations are all\npretty important here.\n\n347\n00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.960\n&gt;&gt; They really are,\nthe job rotation's a very good thing for\n\n348\n00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.920\na company as well, because it allows them\nto cross train their employees as Cherokee\n\n349\n00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.880\nwas mentioning.\n\n350\n00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.020\nThe very fact of actually doing\nthis means that the company\n\n351\n00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.800\ncan depend on more than one individual.\n\n352\n00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.970\nIt allows them to also\nfind out the strengths and\n\n353\n00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.020\nweaknesses of that individual, and\n\n354\n00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:11.180\nallows us to then be able to understand\ntheir performance and where they are.\n\n355\n00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.750\nSo job rotation's also very\nimportant because it does actually\n\n356\n00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:18.110\nrequire everybody to understand\na little bit about that piece,\n\n357\n00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:21.310\nespecially in the overall\nimplementation of security policy.\n\n358\n00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:24.950\nIt's not enough just that you know\nhow your particular end works.\n\n359\n00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:28.010\nYou gotta understand where it fits\ninto the overall grand scheme\n\n360\n00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:32.410\nof that security policy is actually a good\nthing for us to understand as well.\n\n361\n00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:35.770\nAnd the idea of separation of duties,\nit has to come about.\n\n362\n00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:40.226\nAccountability is very difficult if only\none person is the person doing everything.\n\n363\n00:19:40.226 --> 00:19:42.215\nAnd once you actually\nhave something like that,\n\n364\n00:19:42.215 --> 00:19:44.530\nit means you don't\nreally have the control.\n\n365\n00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:47.230\nBy implementing these\nseparation of duties,\n\n366\n00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:51.410\nit gives us an automatic way in which we\nimplement the idea of accountability and\n\n367\n00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:55.480\ncontrols by having two people do the job,\nlike what Cherokee was saying.\n\n368\n00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.500\nSo all these are very important measures.\n\n369\n00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:02.440\nAnd in terms of policy, right, Cherokee\nshowed us, at least at the top of her\n\n370\n00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.400\nscreen, where it talked about\nthe importance of these policies for\n\n371\n00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.400\nsecurity benefits and\nhelping to reduce the amount of risk.\n\n372\n00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:13.286\nA solid security policy and\neverything that we've mentioned here,\n\n373\n00:20:13.286 --> 00:20:17.116\nit really does actually give\nthe entire organization an open plan.\n\n374\n00:20:17.116 --> 00:20:17.822\nIn other words,\n\n375\n00:20:17.822 --> 00:20:21.580\nsomething that everybody can point to\nwhen they don't know what the answer is.\n\n376\n00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.290\nThe policy should answer\nthe majority of those questions too.\n\n377\n00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:27.355\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, you're removing any kind\nof guesswork out of that situation.\n\n378\n00:20:27.355 --> 00:20:30.685\nSo having these policies in place,\nlet's say that\n\n379\n00:20:30.685 --> 00:20:34.725\nit's my company's policy that all guests\nmust be escorted within a building.\n\n380\n00:20:34.725 --> 00:20:36.840\nAnd all the employees must wear ID badges.\n\n381\n00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.890\nSo by implementing all these musts, or\n\n382\n00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:43.450\nthese policies, when I see someone\nthat looks a little out of place,\n\n383\n00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:46.670\nI don't need to go up to them and\nask them any kind of questions.\n\n384\n00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:49.970\nI know whom I should contact\nbecause I can identify that person.\n\n385\n00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.240\nLook, they're a guest because\nthey don't have their badge.\n\n386\n00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.360\nThey're not escorted,\nsomething's out of line here.\n\n387\n00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.740\nSo having these types of policies\ntake all of that guesswork right out.\n\n388\n00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:02.150\nEverything is defined,\nwhat should be done in certain situations.\n\n389\n00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:03.890\nAnd lastly if we look at my screen,\n\n390\n00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.450\nthere was one more concept\nI wanted to address here.\n\n391\n00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:10.480\nThis is going to be our principle or\nconcept of least privilege.\n\n392\n00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:15.460\nAnd what this states is, that we're\nonly providing enough access for\n\n393\n00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.140\nan individual to perform\ntheir daily duties.\n\n394\n00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:19.250\nEasy enough, right?\n\n395\n00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:22.023\nSo whether it be technical controls,\n\n396\n00:21:22.023 --> 00:21:26.660\nokay, like network access controls,\nor whether it be physical building.\n\n397\n00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.160\nTalk about wearing those ID badges.\n\n398\n00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:33.960\nThat's great because those ID badges\ncan also work as key cards for\n\n399\n00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:39.210\ncertain access into the building, so those\nare perfect examples of least privilege.\n\n400\n00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:43.780\nWe always want to go ahead and\nkind of just shrink our\n\n401\n00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:47.310\ntarget area by implementing\nthe principle of least privilege there.\n\n402\n00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.320\n&gt;&gt; There is no doubt that this is one of\nthe more frustrating things that people\n\n403\n00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.220\ndon't understand.\n\n404\n00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:55.290\nThe principle of least privilege really\nhas to do with the very fact that not\n\n405\n00:21:55.290 --> 00:22:00.080\neveryone needs access to everything, but\neverybody also needs enough permissions or\n\n406\n00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.330\nenough privileges so\nthey can do their job.\n\n407\n00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.130\nSo when you implement\nthe principal of least privilege,\n\n408\n00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:09.450\nyou need to make sure of those two things;\nthat they have enough to do their job, but\n\n409\n00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:14.320\nat the same time, in terms of privileges,\nbut at the same not too much beyond that.\n\n410\n00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.920\nSo this is where in the IT world,\n\n411\n00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:21.650\nright, when we start dealing\nwith things like permissions and\n\n412\n00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:27.330\npolicies over files, we actually do set\nup the idea of access control lists.\n\n413\n00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.210\nWe do implement that on routers.\n\n414\n00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:32.050\nWe do implement that in\nterms of firewall rules.\n\n415\n00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.145\nSo that we only allow for\nthe privileges that we need,\n\n416\n00:22:34.145 --> 00:22:38.950\ncuz that's very important if we allow\neverything, it's very difficult for\n\n417\n00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:44.270\nus to go ahead and actually be able\nto monitor or to track anything.\n\n418\n00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.590\nIf we don't allow anything,\n\n419\n00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:49.870\nit means that you have to have more\nadministrative control by yourself and\n\n420\n00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:53.430\nmake decisions on everything, which means\nyou can't do anything else as well.\n\n421\n00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:57.612\nSo implementing that perfect balance\nof giving the permissions needed, but\n\n422\n00:22:57.612 --> 00:23:00.955\nnot too much, is actually a very\ngood balance type of security\n\n423\n00:23:00.955 --> 00:23:04.579\npolicy that really does help\nthe organization out as well, okay?\n\n424\n00:23:04.579 --> 00:23:05.519\nAll right, Cherokee,\n\n425\n00:23:05.519 --> 00:23:08.980\nany other thing that we need to address\nhere in this particular episode?\n\n426\n00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:13.140\n&gt;&gt; I think there is a new trending topic\nthat we should at least address here, and\n\n427\n00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:18.180\nthis is going to be a risk\nassociated with cloud utilization.\n\n428\n00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.870\nUsing the cloud is so trendy.\n\n429\n00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:21.700\nIt's so perfect for so many companies.\n\n430\n00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.260\nIt's becoming affordable.\n\n431\n00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:28.540\nSo there are some special risks that\nwe might wanna talk about there.\n\n432\n00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:29.940\nI mean you have to think about it,\n\n433\n00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.700\nlike we mentioned before whenever\nwe had risk transference.\n\n434\n00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:38.440\nYou really need to pay extra attention\nto your Service Level Agreements,\n\n435\n00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:43.170\nwhenever you're coming into that\nagreement with your third party entities.\n\n436\n00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:48.170\nEspecially if you're storing any kind of\ncustomer information, because having that\n\n437\n00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:51.640\ncontrol within your environment and\nyour security policies, that's fine.\n\n438\n00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.660\nBut when we're talking about another\norganization, you don't control that.\n\n439\n00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:56.470\nYou're not hiring their employees.\n\n440\n00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:59.360\nSo you have to have that\nlevel of trust there.\n\n441\n00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.370\nYou're dealing with the web, okay?\n\n442\n00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:08.090\nAnd all the protocols for our web traffic,\ndifferent types of cross-site scripting.\n\n443\n00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:13.430\nOWASP has a slew of different types of\nattacks that are really targeted for\n\n444\n00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:14.890\nthese types of protocols.\n\n445\n00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:20.098\nSo you introduce a whole\nanother realm of risks.\n\n446\n00:24:20.098 --> 00:24:23.890\nIf that's what the way your company is\ngoing to be going, you need to really look\n\n447\n00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:27.320\nat that individually and\nassess all those particular risks.\n\n448\n00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.980\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, every company is going to treat\nthe cloud a little bit differently,\n\n449\n00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.390\ndepending on their organization.\n\n450\n00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:35.420\nSome might just use it for\nthe idea of backing up\n\n451\n00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.260\nall their information to a cloud storage\nto make it available anytime and\n\n452\n00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.990\nnot depend on machine that's locally,\nokay?\n\n453\n00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:45.743\nSome need it because it's the heart\nof their business to allow for\n\n454\n00:24:45.743 --> 00:24:48.650\nproviding access to\ninformation as we need.\n\n455\n00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:53.300\nSo for example, right here at ITProTV,\nwe've talked about the idea of actually\n\n456\n00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:57.660\nbuilding a complete server farm to\nhouse all of the data that everybody,\n\n457\n00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:01.280\nall the members on our site,\nwould actually be able to get access to.\n\n458\n00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.928\nBut once we started taking a look at that,\nthe other things that you also have\n\n459\n00:25:04.928 --> 00:25:07.960\nto consider in terms of risk is\nthe power and the availability.\n\n460\n00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.340\nIf one of our servers dies,\nthe replacement cost of all that stuff.\n\n461\n00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.320\nSo instead what we did was we decided\nwe'd implement it on cloud storage.\n\n462\n00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:21.720\nWe off-loaded that risk, essentially\ntransferring it to our cloud providers so\n\n463\n00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.690\nthat now if there is a server that\ngoes down, well they already have\n\n464\n00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:29.560\na structure in place where it's taken\nover, where we're not so worried about it.\n\n465\n00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.810\nSame thing with access.\n\n466\n00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:34.120\nIf our Internet connection here\nin our studios goes down and\n\n467\n00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.810\nall of our stuff was here that means,well,\n\n468\n00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:39.410\nyou wouldn't have access to the materials\nsuch as what you're watching.\n\n469\n00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:43.590\nSo instead you do, you tend to actually\nhave to worry about those types of things.\n\n470\n00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:46.260\nIn terms of risks, though,\nyour company balances that out and\n\n471\n00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:50.360\nthey do that risk analysis that we've been\ntalking about in these previous episodes\n\n472\n00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.680\nto help us to understand that.\n\n473\n00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.947\nAnd so every company is gonna assess\nit a little bit differently, but\n\n474\n00:25:54.947 --> 00:25:58.213\nyou have to assess it not only from\nthe standpoint of availability and\n\n475\n00:25:58.213 --> 00:26:00.775\nneed, but\nalso with security in mind as well, okay.\n\n476\n00:26:00.775 --> 00:26:03.630\nAll right, Cherokee, anything else\nthat we need to address here?\n\n477\n00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:05.680\n&gt;&gt; I think that's about it, Ronnie.\n\n478\n00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.220\n&gt;&gt; All right, well that's a great\nplace for us to end this episode then.\n\n479\n00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.385\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n480\n00:26:12.385 --> 00:26:13.772\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n481\n00:26:13.772 --> 00:26:16.919\n&gt;&gt; Stay

and welcome to another episode of\nITProTV, my name is Mike Rodrick, and\n\n5\n00:00:37,052 --> 00:00:38,764\nwith me today is my good buddy, Wes Bryan.\n\n6\n00:00:38,764 --> 00:00:39,990\nHow you doing Wes?\n\n7\n00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,370\nI'm doing okay man, how you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,910\nI'm hanging in there, hanging in there.\n\n9\n00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,050\nYou know, it was surprising this morning.\n\n10\n00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,650\nYou wake up here, we're in Florida, and\nit said 88 degrees out, and it actually\n\n11\n00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,830\nfelt like 88 degrees rather than saying\n88 degrees and feeling like 105.\n\n12\n00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:54,695\nYeah, right?\n\n13\n00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:56,147\n[LAUGH] So not too bad.\n\n14\n00:00:56,147 --> 00:00:58,251\n[LAUGH] It was a little bit of\na better day when [CROSSTALK].\n\n15\n00:00:58,251 --> 00:00:59,070\nDefinitely.\nNot bad.\n\n16\n00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,624\nAll right, well today, we are going to\nbe continuing on with our Security+,\n\n17\n00:01:03,624 --> 00:01:06,110\nhitting those SY0-401 objectives.\n\n18\n00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,269\nAnd we're gonna start\noff with Objective 2.5.\n\n19\n00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,276\nI'm sorry not 2.5, 2.2.\n\n20\n00:01:11,276 --> 00:01:11,949\n2.2, yep.\n\n21\n00:01:11,949 --> 00:01:15,073\nWhich is going to be summarizing\nthe security implications\n\n22\n00:01:15,073 --> 00:01:17,829\nof integrating system and\ndata with third parties.\n\n23\n00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:20,250\nDon't try to say that ten times fast, man.\n\n24\n00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,130\nYeah, right you know?\n\n25\n00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:21,830\nIt's really,\n\n26\n00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,410\nit's all about working together with other\norganizations is what it comes down to.\n\n27\n00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:30,110\nIn today's environment,\nit's a very common thing.\n\n28\n00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,730\nWe've got the businesses that\ndevelop these relationships and\n\n29\n00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,290\nthey share information\nabout Web applications that\n\n30\n00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,650\nanother organization's users need to\nbe able to access to do their job.\n\n31\n00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:46,230\nAs we've got this sharing that's\ngoing on with this, this exposing\n\n32\n00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,990\nof networks to other organizations,\nbusiness partners and things like that.\n\n33\n00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,890\nAnd that opens up a whole\nother world of issues and\n\n34\n00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,460\nthreats and\nvulnerabilities that we have to deal with.\n\n35\n00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,020\nYeah, sure.\n\n36\n00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,950\nYou know, when we talk about adding\nany kind of extra technology,\n\n37\n00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,230\nwe always talk about increasing\nthat attack surface.\n\n38\n00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,390\nAnd when you have two companies\nthat have to now figure out,\n\n39\n00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,320\nhow do we interconnect together?\n\n40\n00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,690\nHow do we bring our systems together\nin a way that's gonna be secure and\n\n41\n00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,550\nreliable for both companies?\n\n42\n00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:16,570\nLike for instance, if you got\na health care provider that needs to\n\n43\n00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,450\ninteract with some Medicare-based,\nyou know, federal system.\n\n44\n00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,090\nThere's going to have to be some kind of\nprocess that they go to to ensure that\n\n45\n00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,610\nboth sides of the party\ndon't violate any laws.\n\n46\n00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,540\nRight.\n\n47\n00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,730\nInadvertently expose data that just\nshouldn't be out there, you know?\n\n48\n00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,560\nExactly, exactly.\n\n49\n00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,130\nSo it's gonna be a lot of terminology\nagain that we've got to go over.\n\n50\n00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,200\nJust some and we're gonna kind of\nsummarize some general concepts.\n\n51\n00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,080\nNot hit anything too terribly deep just\na lot of that high level overview of\n\n52\n00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,930\na lot of these concepts of working\nwith other organizations and\n\n53\n00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,180\nthings we got to be aware of to keep\nour networks and our data safe.\n\n54\n00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,750\nAnd we definitely go in more depth,\nlike in the PMP sections and\n\n55\n00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,220\nthe CISSP where you just go more and\nmore in depth into some of these concepts.\n\n56\n00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,550\nYou know, in general, first thing we want\nto start off with is look at CompTIA's\n\n57\n00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,150\ndefinition of a business partner.\n\n58\n00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,950\nWhen we look at a business partner,\n\n59\n00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,690\nthey're gonna define it a commercial\nentity that has a relationship of\n\n60\n00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,995\nsome sort with another\nseparate commercial entity.\n\n61\n00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:15,640\nMm-hm.\nSo again the concept of two businesses.\n\n62\n00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,590\nA supplier or a manufacturer and\n\n63\n00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,920\na raw material supplier could be two\nbusinesses that are kind of in the same\n\n64\n00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,840\ngeneral field that share information\nwith each other about best practices and\n\n65\n00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,230\nprocedures that they use that find\nuseful and makes them successful.\n\n66\n00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,720\nSo different types of business\npartners that we're gonna have.\n\n67\n00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,740\nYeah, and\nto give kind of like a couple of examples,\n\n68\n00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,860\nI think like Medicare-based\nsystems where you have\n\n69\n00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,320\nobviously a federal organization and\nthen you have a health provider.\n\n70\n00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,650\nIf you've got two banks,\nif they're doing business together,\n\n71\n00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,815\nif you have companies that\nget defense contracts.\n\n72\n00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:55,175\nYou know, get defense contracts from\nthe DOD to maybe, I don't know,\n\n73\n00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:56,545\nmake unmanned spy planes.\n\n74\n00:03:56,545 --> 00:03:59,525\nJust some of the ones that I can think\nof that we've heard of recently.\n\n75\n00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:02,560\nWell, they have to come into some kind\nof agreement on how they're gonna\n\n76\n00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,520\nshare information, or really if they're\neven going to share information.\n\n77\n00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,750\nRight.\nAnd, some terms\n\n78\n00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,490\nthat we might not as familiar\nwith that they throw into\n\n79\n00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,290\nthis 401 set of objectives is\nthis onboarding and offboarding.\n\n80\n00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,390\nAnd really,\nwe're talking about the policy or\n\n81\n00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,690\nthe process of bringing in\nthat business partner, right?\n\n82\n00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,160\nGetting that initial setup so that when\nthat partnership starts we've got to\n\n83\n00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,290\nlay out how is this\narrangement gonna work?\n\n84\n00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,030\nWho is gonna be responsible?\n\n85\n00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,150\nMaking sure that either side bears\nsome of that responsibility for\n\n86\n00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,900\nkeeping that data safe.\n\n87\n00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,850\nMaking sure that it's not being\nexposed to unauthorized users.\n\n88\n00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,870\nAnd then, who's liable?\n\n89\n00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,840\nIf something was to happen, and\nsome of that data was to become exposed,\n\n90\n00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,050\nthere's going to be a lot\nof finger pointing, right?\n\n91\n00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,002\n[CROSSTALK] Who the heck did this?\n\n92\n00:04:52,002 --> 00:04:55,920\nSo, in that onboarding process,\nwe're going to lay it out.\n\n93\n00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,070\nOkay, we'll be responsible for this.\n\n94\n00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:01,110\nYou guys are gonna be responsible for\nthat part.\n\n95\n00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,290\nWe'll give you access to this database, or\nwhatever, but when it comes to that Web\n\n96\n00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,330\napplications that's pulling that\ndata maybe you're responsible.\n\n97\n00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,330\nOr you're responsible for making sure that\n\n98\n00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,580\nonly your sales people can gain access\nto the Web app and not your other users.\n\n99\n00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,480\nSure, yeah.\n\n100\n00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,870\nAnd if they come back and find out that\none of their other employees made a huge\n\n101\n00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,230\norder just for goofs or whatever that\nwe can hold them accountable for that.\n\n102\n00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:31,600\nDefinitely, so we need some kind of\nsystematic approach when it comes to\n\n103\n00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,360\ngranting a partner company access\nto our internal infrastructure.\n\n104\n00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,070\nAnd let alone,\nyour internal infrastructure,\n\n105\n00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,300\nultimately gives access to,\nwell, our internal resources.\n\n106\n00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,490\nSo, we need some kind of systematic\napproach that both partners,\n\n107\n00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,910\nwith both commercial entities,\nlike you mentioned.\n\n108\n00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,180\nYou know, have an understanding on what's\ngoing clearly defined on how this will\n\n109\n00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,820\nhappen, and both companies\nare comfortable with the agreement, too.\n\n110\n00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,060\nExactly, exactly.\n\n111\n00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,295\nAnd then just the opposite when\nwe're done with that partnership.\n\n112\n00:06:00,295 --> 00:06:02,030\nMm-hm.\nAt some point that partnership,\n\n113\n00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,930\nit gets to the end of its lifetime and\n\n114\n00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,560\nthat's where we hit the offboarding, where\nwe're kinda gonna go in the other way.\n\n115\n00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,640\nWe're gonna make sure that we terminate\nthat access that that Web application\n\n116\n00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,140\nis no longer available or that data is\nno longer available to that other side\n\n117\n00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,480\nmaking sure we eliminate that access.\n\n118\n00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,930\nWe don't just forget about it, and go oh.\n\n119\n00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,760\nSo we basically leave a backdoor,\n\n120\n00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,260\nthat somebody from that other organization\ncould attempt to come through and\n\n121\n00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,860\nstill gain access to the resources\nunmonitored, and things like that.\n\n122\n00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,150\nDefinitely, sounds like you geeks out\nthere that know the networking concepts.\n\n123\n00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,190\nIt sounds like the session layer for\nbusiness bureaucracy.\n\n124\n00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,677\nYeah, right.\n[LAUGH] Exactly so.\n\n125\n00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:41,814\nBreaking up communications, or building\ncommunications and then tearing them down.\n\n126\n00:06:41,814 --> 00:06:42,380\nRight.\n\n127\n00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,430\nRight.\nSo onboarding,\n\n128\n00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,646\nbringing that business partner in,\nget everything defined and who's liable,\n\n129\n00:06:47,646 --> 00:06:48,830\nwho's responsible.\n\n130\n00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,900\nOffboarding, terminating that\nbusiness partnership, and eliminating\n\n131\n00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,512\nthe access and making sure they no\nlonger have access to the resources and\n\n132\n00:06:57,512 --> 00:07:01,410\ncan't once it's no longer necessary.\n\n133\n00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:01,910\nThat's right.\n\n134\n00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:08,040\nSocial media brings in a whole\nnew set of concerns into\n\n135\n00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,440\nour network security as well.\n\n136\n00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,100\nDoesn't it?\nYeah,\n\n137\n00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,020\nit certainly does cuz a lot of companies\ntoday, we think of social media and\n\n138\n00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,330\nwe think of social engineering and stuff\nlike that concept that people of our,\n\n139\n00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,830\nyou guys are probably already familiar\nwith, but businesses use social media as\n\n140\n00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:31,990\na way to have external exposure and\nbring even an exposure to their products,\n\n141\n00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,970\nwhatever their next releases.\n\n142\n00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,900\nSo we use these a lot just to have\nsome kind of public presence.\n\n143\n00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,750\nBut the problem is, like you're saying,\nthis definitely opens another attack\n\n144\n00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,070\nvector, another portion of that\nthat we need to control from\n\n145\n00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:53,440\nlike unauthorized data sharing,\ndisclosing information.\n\n146\n00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,380\nIt may be unfortunately it was a violation\nof an NDA, a non-disclosure agreement.\n\n147\n00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,061\nSo we definitely have to\nkeep that in check, and\n\n148\n00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:01,372\nthere has to be checks and balances.\n\n149\n00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:05,758\nI mean, you got Facebook out there, and\nI'm not downing these social medias, but\n\n150\n00:08:05,758 --> 00:08:10,333\nyou got Facebook, you got Twitter, you got\nLinkedIn out there, Yammer, we've seen\n\n151\n00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:14,617\nYammer for awhile, where it's kind of\nlike a business type internal Facebook.\n\n152\n00:08:14,617 --> 00:08:17,618\nBut there again, if you have business\npartners that have access to\n\n153\n00:08:17,618 --> 00:08:21,424\nthe same platform, they can inadvertently\ndisclose information that should never\n\n154\n00:08:21,424 --> 00:08:22,990\nhave been released to the public.\n\n155\n00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,600\nAbsolutely, yeah.\n\n156\n00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,810\nSome of those like Facebook.\n\n157\n00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,720\nIt's one of the things\nthat drives me crazy.\n\n158\n00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,950\nI'm not a huge Facebook fan,\nyou know Sure.\n\n159\n00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,040\nBut you know, it's a good way,\nI always thought it was a good way for\n\n160\n00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,490\npeople to stay in touch with friends\nthat are across the country or\n\n161\n00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,630\naround the world or whatever.\n\n162\n00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,110\nBut is has become such\na business oriented thing.\n\n163\n00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,552\nYou cannot get on Facebook without\ngetting slammed with advertisements for\n\n164\n00:08:42,552 --> 00:08:44,200\nwanting hey, like my company.\n\n165\n00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,350\nEvery web page you go to has a,\neven ours, right?\n\n166\n00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,160\nWe've got our Twitter feed down there.\n\n167\n00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,970\nThat's right.\n\n168\n00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,790\nOur Facebook feed in cuz it's a great way\nto get out there and get your name and\n\n169\n00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,740\nto introduce yourself to lots of people.\n\n170\n00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,190\nYeah, definitely.\nBut what happens is people forget.\n\n171\n00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,050\nLike Facebook, for example,\n\n172\n00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,640\nI'm using Facebook because it is one of\nthe few that I've actually tried out.\n\n173\n00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,550\nI mean the privacy controls\nare not easy to understand.\n\n174\n00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,510\nThey don't make it real simple and so\nwhen people are posting stuff on there,\n\n175\n00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:17,250\nthey might not be aware of who's\nable to see that information?\n\n176\n00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:22,020\nAnd that's a big, it's one thing to be\nsitting at the bar, or the restaurant,\n\n177\n00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,720\nor something like that, and maybe let some\ninformation slip that you shouldn't have.\n\n178\n00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,010\nOkay so a few people heard you,\nand they told somebody and\n\n179\n00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,000\nit gets out a little bit.\n\n180\n00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,250\nYou put it on Facebook and\nnow you're talking about.\n\n181\n00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,120\nMillions, within seconds.\n\n182\n00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,260\nYeah, hundreds of thousands or millions\nof people of seeing that information.\n\n183\n00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,520\nSo you didn't just leak\nit to a few people.\n\n184\n00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,550\nYou know, you've leaked it half the world,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n185\n00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,200\nAnd it's just a runaway problem.\n\n186\n00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,830\nAnd at that point you've\nliterally started a forest fire.\n\n187\n00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,380\nAbsolutely.\nAnd\n\n188\n00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,510\nthe way to control that is education,\nright?\n\n189\n00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:53,570\nTeaching our users that social media sites\nlike that are not the place to discuss\n\n190\n00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,420\ncertain things.\n\n191\n00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,690\nThere are business aspects.\n\n192\n00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,310\nThere is no privacy.\n\n193\n00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,280\nFor here, for example,\nwe keep our Facebook page, but\n\n194\n00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,430\nit's separate from our personal pages.\n\n195\n00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:02,930\nThat's right.\n\n196\n00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:03,750\nAnd things like that.\n\n197\n00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,270\nYou have to be really careful.\n\n198\n00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,780\nAnd I go in and\npost that picture late on a Friday night.\n\n199\n00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,060\nAnd I want to make sure I post\nthat on my personal page and\n\n200\n00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,997\nnot my business page, right?\n\n201\n00:10:13,997 --> 00:10:15,390\nAnd do things like that.\n\n202\n00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,040\nDefinitely.\nIt does bring a whole new\n\n203\n00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,000\nset of concerns in, because it\nhas such a wide reaching effect.\n\n204\n00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,080\nNow when we do let some of that out,\nchat rooms,\n\n205\n00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,650\nyou know, those instant message\ntype programs and things like that.\n\n206\n00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:34,820\nPeople don't realize, hey, if you're not\nusing an in-house chat room or program.\n\n207\n00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,790\nLike message platform.\n\n208\n00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,860\nRight.\n\n209\n00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,720\nPeople don't think about it.\n\n210\n00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,410\nHey, I'm just sending my\ncoworker a quick message.\n\n211\n00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,760\nHey, did you check on that account\nnumber buhbuhbuhbuhbuhbuhbuhbuh and\n\n212\n00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,260\nnot realizing that that message\ndidn't just go from your computer,\n\n213\n00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,050\nover there to Bob's computer\nin the next office.\n\n214\n00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:49,560\nRight, good point.\n\n215\n00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,330\nIt went out to the Internet, bounced off\na server out there, and then came back in.\n\n216\n00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,020\nWhich means that data was exposed\nto the public infrastructure.\n\n217\n00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,100\nIs that chat program\nyou're using encrypting?\n\n218\n00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,800\nIs there any type of\nauthentication going on?\n\n219\n00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,630\nWhen that little light comes on and\n\n220\n00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,650\nit says Bob is now online,\nis that really Bob?\n\n221\n00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,480\nYou know, I mean how do I know for sure?\n\n222\n00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,600\nSo, you know,\neducating your users that these are not,\n\n223\n00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,540\nmost of these are not really secure.\n\n224\n00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,680\nOr that they have it's just,\n\n225\n00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,540\nyou shouldn't be putting information\nlike that in those media programs.\n\n226\n00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,200\nThat's right.\n\n227\n00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,820\nI mean you've got people that\nare literally searching those social\n\n228\n00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,620\nmedia avenues.\n\n229\n00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,250\nAnd social engineers, that's all they do.\n\n230\n00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,370\nOh yeah.\nJust scour tons and\n\n231\n00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,810\ntons of public pages for businesses\njust trying to get any little bit of\n\n232\n00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:42,360\ninformation that they could either use\nagainst you, or maybe sell to a partner.\n\n233\n00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,360\nSet up a fake account,\nyou can spoof somebody so easy on there.\n\n234\n00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,350\nSay oh yeah, this is you long lost\nfriend from blah, blah, blah.\n\n235\n00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,150\nThat's right.\nAnd it's too easy.\n\n236\n00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,420\nToo easy.\n\n237\n00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,210\nSo yeah.\nWhole new set of concerns there that we\n\n238\n00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:54,970\nhave to deal with.\n\n239\n00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:58,430\nAnd like I said it really comes\ndown to training your users.\n\n240\n00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,790\nEducating them, you know, having a lunch\nand learn, or something like that.\n\n241\n00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,820\nAnd discussing what's acceptable and\nwhat's not acceptable.\n\n242\n00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,960\nYou know, what we're allowed to use\nthose for as far as company goes.\n\n243\n00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,150\nAnd just teaching them and maybe going\nthrough and having a class on the security\n\n244\n00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:17,310\noptions that are available in some\nof those social media type programs.\n\n245\n00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,640\nOr eliminating, some businesses just\nsay hey, look no you can't use them.\n\n246\n00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,623\nNothing work related goes in,\nany type of social media thing.\n\n247\n00:12:24,623 --> 00:12:25,969\nVery good.\n\n248\n00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,510\nAnd then we got a whole lot of policies.\n\n249\n00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,220\nPart of security unfortunately is\ngoing to be generating a lot of\n\n250\n00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,170\npolicies because I have to lay this out.\n\n251\n00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,130\nWe have to do the old CYA thing.\n\n252\n00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:43,370\nSo we have to have policies in place that\ndefine what's acceptable, what's not.\n\n253\n00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,790\nAnd either have employees sign them if\nthey have to do with employees,or their\n\n254\n00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,430\nagreements with those business partners.\n\n255\n00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,920\nAnd when it comes to\nour business partners,\n\n256\n00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,130\na lot of, they call them\nthe interoperability agreements.\n\n257\n00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,570\nAnd I got a few of them listed here\nthat we should discuss, like SLAs.\n\n258\n00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,430\nWe've seen those in a couple\nof our different episodes,\n\n259\n00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,200\nwe've talked about SLAs.\n\n260\n00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,020\nDefinitely, definitely.\n\n261\n00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,300\nWe've taken them from an ISP standpoint,\nwhat's that minimum level of acceptable\n\n262\n00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,030\nservice that can be given before it's\na violation of whatever the agreement is?\n\n263\n00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,130\nRight, right, so\nSLA being service level agreement.\n\n264\n00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,540\nAnd in its simplest form as you\ncan see in my definitions here,\n\n265\n00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,090\nclearly defines what services are to be\nprovided to the client, and what support,\n\n266\n00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,700\nif any, will be provided.\n\n267\n00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,450\nBut again it's a lot like CYA, right?\n\n268\n00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,080\nIt is.\nCover your you know what.\n\n269\n00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,500\nWe want to make sure that this is all laid\nout in writing, signed by both sides,\n\n270\n00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,740\nagreed upon.\n\n271\n00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,160\nSo that when it comes down to an issue,\nwe have this piece of paper to back us up.\n\n272\n00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,060\nThat's right, yeah.\n\n273\n00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,860\nAnd we can say look you\npromised us 99.99% up time,\n\n274\n00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,810\nit's in my service level agreement.\n\n275\n00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:51,130\nOr you promised us, hey if we\nhave a problem with our computer,\n\n276\n00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:55,130\nwe can get a hold of your tech support at\nany time between the hours of 8AM and 8PM.\n\n277\n00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,640\nYeah definitely we're business partners\nnow, Mike, didn't you take care of that,\n\n278\n00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,050\nI thought that was your client?\n\n279\n00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:00,800\nExactly.\n\n280\n00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,550\nYou didn't take care of it, or vice versa,\nWes, I thought that was your client.\n\n281\n00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,560\nWell we had that understanding of who is\ngoing to provide that service as well when\n\n282\n00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,940\nyou've got these two businesses\nthat are collaborating and\n\n283\n00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,080\nagain we talked about integrating\ntheir systems together so\n\n284\n00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,870\nI can't just turn around and say hey Mike,\nwell I thought you had that.\n\n285\n00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,870\nWell wait a second, we've got a clear\ndocumentation that defines who is going to\n\n286\n00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:25,420\nprovide certain services when we come\ntogether and we're collaborating.\n\n287\n00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,610\nRight exactly, yes.\n\n288\n00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,070\nToday with all the outsourcing that we do.\n\n289\n00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,210\nEspecially your smaller\norganizations that just can't have\n\n290\n00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:36,660\na full time web staff to support\na website or a tech support staff, and\n\n291\n00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,510\nthey can have in house available 24-7,\non call.\n\n292\n00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,830\nSo we end up outsourcing, because\nwe still need that kind of support,\n\n293\n00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,780\nI just don't need it all the time.\n\n294\n00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,610\nI can't afford it.\n\n295\n00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,740\nSo we have these SLAs that say,\n\n296\n00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,230\nhey, this is what we expect,\nthis is what you promised to provide us.\n\n297\n00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,780\nAnd it gives us something to fall back\non in the event that they don't provide\n\n298\n00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,730\nwhat we agreed on.\n\n299\n00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,620\nLegally binding.\n\n300\n00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,450\nYeah Sure Exactly, exactly We've got\nbusiness partner agreements, another type\n\n301\n00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,920\nof policy that we end up with when we deal\nwith our business partners, and these\n\n302\n00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,430\nare gonna define how the relationship\nitself is going to be conducted.\n\n303\n00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,700\nAnd who is going to provide,\nas Wes was saying,\n\n304\n00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,070\nwho's going to provide those services.\n\n305\n00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,740\nWho's going to be financially\nresponsible sometimes.\n\n306\n00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,960\nIt's going to change and\nvary between different partnerships.\n\n307\n00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,470\nBut they are typically going to include\nthings like, who's responsible for\n\n308\n00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,340\nproviding the services.\n\n309\n00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,210\nWho's responsible for paying.\n\n310\n00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,700\nAnd then who's responsible for\nthe security.\n\n311\n00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,170\nThat's right, yup, Yeah definitely you\nknow it's one of those documents that\n\n312\n00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:42,811\nare just about foundational to\neverything that we're doing, and again,\n\n313\n00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:45,847\ndefining how business is\ngoing to be conducted.\n\n314\n00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:49,040\nWho's going to be liable\nif it's not conducted and\n\n315\n00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,571\nnot just liabilities but just establishing\na clear definition of each of\n\n316\n00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:57,376\nthe components that are gonna\nbe a part of this partnership.\n\n317\n00:15:57,376 --> 00:15:57,980\nRight.\n\n318\n00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,618\nAnd then you got one called\na memorandum of Understanding,\n\n319\n00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:07,320\nnow these are usually less\nformal type documents.\n\n320\n00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:13,360\nAs CompTIA likes to define them\nenacted in a way to express\n\n321\n00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,250\na desire for all parties to achieve\nthe same goal, in an agreed upon manner.\n\n322\n00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,184\nAgain it's very much like\na business partner agreement but\n\n323\n00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,950\nit's a little less formal.\n\n324\n00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,690\nTypically not legally binding\nis the big difference there.\n\n325\n00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,590\nAnd that's the kind of thing you want\nto pay attention to, guys and gals,\n\n326\n00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,220\nfor this exam.\n\n327\n00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,930\nThey're not going expect you to be\nable to write out a BPA on the exam.\n\n328\n00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:43,040\nThey're not going to want you to fire\nup an SLA on the exam or anything.\n\n329\n00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,500\nBut if they ask you a question about which\ndocument would define who's responsible\n\n330\n00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,100\nfor providing the financial backing for\nthis, that's what you need to know.\n\n331\n00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,840\nOh, is that in my BPA?\n\n332\n00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,690\nIs that in my SLA?\n\n333\n00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:54,940\nAnd things like that.\n\n334\n00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,500\nSo if you get a basic understanding of\nwhat these documents typically provide and\n\n335\n00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,380\nunderstand the learning acronyms.\n\n336\n00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,940\nYeah, I heard a guy say,\n\n337\n00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,035\nhe goes yeah, this is\nthe agreement before the agreement.\n\n338\n00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:11,050\n[LAUGH] When you have, just establishing\nmutually expected expectations\n\n339\n00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:15,020\nwhen you have to bodies that are coming\nkind of striving towards a common goal.\n\n340\n00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,950\nRight.\nWe see this in bilateral agreements, too,\n\n341\n00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,150\nbetween countries.\n\n342\n00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,250\nMm-hm.\nYou know where a country obviously they're\n\n343\n00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,160\nnot enforcing it because each country\nhas their own set of laws so how can you\n\n344\n00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,970\nenforce that between two countries that\nhave completely different sets of laws.\n\n345\n00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,740\nOr it could even be multilateral where you\nhave multiple countries coming together so\n\n346\n00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,050\nwe see it outside\nthe business realm as well.\n\n347\n00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,830\nWhen you have a country saying hey, well,\nwe're gonna come to this understanding and\n\n348\n00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,950\nsince you're on board,\nwe're all striving for\n\n349\n00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,450\nthat common goal that this\ncountry will do the same thing.\n\n350\n00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,970\nBut same thing, you know,\nit could be written out on a napkin.\n\n351\n00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,045\nYes.\nExactly.\n\n352\n00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:53,620\n[LAUGH] You know, yeah.\n\n353\n00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,250\nYeah.\n\n354\n00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:00,210\nAnd then you've got an ISA or\na interconnection security agreement.\n\n355\n00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,880\nAnd this is really dealing with,\nas our technology changes,\n\n356\n00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,780\nour networks change, right?\n\n357\n00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,625\nOur networks are living object\nwe've talked about that before.\n\n358\n00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:11,985\nThey evolve, we add new products,\nnew programs, new technologies.\n\n359\n00:18:11,985 --> 00:18:15,765\nAnd that changes, that introduces\nnew vulnerabilities, right?\n\n360\n00:18:15,765 --> 00:18:16,355\nThat's right.\n\n361\n00:18:16,355 --> 00:18:18,315\nTrue.\nAnd exposes us to different types of\n\n362\n00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:20,845\nthreats that we might not\nhave been exposed to before.\n\n363\n00:18:20,845 --> 00:18:25,095\nSo we have to constantly watch that in\nthat interconnection security agreement,\n\n364\n00:18:25,095 --> 00:18:30,140\nmake sure that the technology that\nthe business partner is implementing\n\n365\n00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,390\nstill falls within what we require for\nsecurity.\n\n366\n00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:38,730\nThey might decide to run some\nin-house message program and\n\n367\n00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,720\nthat message program has a ton of\nvulnerabilities associated with it.\n\n368\n00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,330\nAnd all of a sudden,\nwait a second cuz if you think about it,\n\n369\n00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,200\nwhen you expose yourself like this when we\nset up business partnerships and we allow\n\n370\n00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,400\nanother organization to access our\nnetwork, that becomes an attack portal.\n\n371\n00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,200\nYes.\n\n372\n00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,430\nI mean, if they get compromised and\nthey have access to our network,\n\n373\n00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,490\nnow all of a sudden the bad\nguy might not attack us.\n\n374\n00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,370\nHe might say that wow, these guys have\ntheir network secure I'm having a hard\n\n375\n00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,800\ntime attacking them but,\nI know that their business partners,\n\n376\n00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,360\nthey don't take care of\ntheir network like they do.\n\n377\n00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,300\nBut they're not my primary target,\nbut I'm going to start with them.\n\n378\n00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,910\nI'm going to use them as the doorway in.\n\n379\n00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:18,890\nI can compromise them, and then come\nacross that trust you've established with\n\n380\n00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,400\nthat business partner, and\nattack you through there.\n\n381\n00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,150\nDefinitely.\nSo\n\n382\n00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,260\nyou wanna make sure that\nthey're maintaining and they're\n\n383\n00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,830\nnot introducing new technologies that\nare not being hardened, things like that.\n\n384\n00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,660\nFully tested, yeah, definitely.\n\n385\n00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,170\nWhen we look at what a system\ninterconnection is, you know,\n\n386\n00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,730\nwhat is this agreement's about, it's about\ninterconnection between two IT systems.\n\n387\n00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:43,660\nIn a systems interconnection just when\nyou have two IT infrastructures or\n\n388\n00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,530\nsystems that are connected together for\nthe purposes of data sharing,\n\n389\n00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,910\nresource sharing, information sharing.\n\n390\n00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,810\nAnd, with the ISA like\nyou see the definition,\n\n391\n00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:56,420\nit just provides that planning,\nthe establishing, the maintaining and\n\n392\n00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,130\nalso terminating the connections.\n\n393\n00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,930\nHow are we gonna bring up this connection?\n\n394\n00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,420\nHow are we gonna maintain the connection?\n\n395\n00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:06,530\nAnd then the final process is, how are we\ngonna tear it down and is it gonna require\n\n396\n00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:10,125\nsome non-disclosure agreement where\nwhen you do terminate that connection,\n\n397\n00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,115\npeople can't just be saying, well this\nis what I've seen while I was there.\n\n398\n00:20:13,115 --> 00:20:16,945\nRight, exactly, and, different\ntechnologies we discuss in some of our\n\n399\n00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:20,205\nother episodes of how we go about\nconnecting our networks, right?\n\n400\n00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:22,540\nIt might be a direct\naccess type connection.\n\n401\n00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,170\nCould be a VPN tunnel that we set up,\ncould be an extranet that we set up.\n\n402\n00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,780\nDefinitely.\nSo different types of connectivity\n\n403\n00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,570\nbetween, could be as simple as just a Web\napplication that we run out in our DMZ and\n\n404\n00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,760\nwe give them access to.\n\n405\n00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,320\nFederated Services could be tied in.\n\n406\n00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,710\nYeah, there you go.\n\n407\n00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:43,100\nAnd we could start bringing in cloud\nproviders where we use Microsoft Azure and\n\n408\n00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,080\ntheir Federation services to generate\na trust between two organizations.\n\n409\n00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,300\nThat's a good way to put it,\nan interbusiness trust model.\n\n410\n00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,055\nYeah, exactly.\n\n411\n00:20:50,055 --> 00:20:50,970\n[LAUGH] Very cool.\n\n412\n00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:54,070\nA few different there so you get the SLA,\nthat Service Level Agreement.\n\n413\n00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,080\nYou got that BPA,\nthat Business Partner Agreement.\n\n414\n00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,220\nYou got the interconnection security\nagreements, if I can say that,\n\n415\n00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:06,010\nISA, and then the MOA,\nthe memorandum of understanding.\n\n416\n00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,820\nTypical documents that we're\ngonna see when we're setting up\n\n417\n00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,170\na business partnership.\n\n418\n00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:16,540\nAll right, let's see, let's talk\nabout some privacy considerations.\n\n419\n00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:21,120\nI don't really,\nI'm trying to think of a good way to,\n\n420\n00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,150\none of the things where you've gotta\nworry about obviously, is privacy.\n\n421\n00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,380\nAs your end users have a certain\nexpectancy of privacy.\n\n422\n00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,660\nThat's right.\n\n423\n00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,100\nWe've talked about that in\na couple of other episodes.\n\n424\n00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,040\nBut we're talking about business\n[INAUDIBLE] agreements and\n\n425\n00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,480\nbusiness partnerships.\n\n426\n00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,210\nAs a business,\nI have a certain expectation of privacy.\n\n427\n00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:39,770\nThat's right.\n\n428\n00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,910\nMeaning I'm not going to expose\nmy entire network to them.\n\n429\n00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:47,200\nI've got certain areas that I want to make\navailable to these business partners but\n\n430\n00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,930\nI have other areas that\nthey don't need access to.\n\n431\n00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,970\nI don't want them seeing\nmy customer database.\n\n432\n00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,890\nYou know maybe, or something like that.\n\n433\n00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,300\nThat's what I was thinking, yeah,\n\n434\n00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,930\nif you have one business has access\nto all of the customer information,\n\n435\n00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:02,352\nwhether it be credit card information,\naddresses, telephone numbers.\n\n436\n00:22:02,352 --> 00:22:04,820\nYou know the other partner\nin that can't just\n\n437\n00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,060\nexpose that information to the public\nbecause there is a certain\n\n438\n00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,300\npoint when yes it is our information\ncuz it resides within our data centers.\n\n439\n00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,090\nBut there's also a certain portion of it,\nand\n\n440\n00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:16,170\nI'm sure it's defined in the agreements,\nthat is customer data.\n\n441\n00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,660\nAnd that data shouldn't be disclosed\nmaybe even between the partnership.\n\n442\n00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,440\nAbsolutely.\n\n443\n00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,160\nI've worked with a couple of\ndifferent training companies and\n\n444\n00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,120\nthis one training company had,\nIt was a franchise-type training company.\n\n445\n00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,420\nWe had partnerships with\nthese other franchises.\n\n446\n00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:35,150\nAll still under the same main umbrella\nof this training provider, but\n\n447\n00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,010\neach location was franchised.\n\n448\n00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,820\nSo we worked together\nin a lot of respects.\n\n449\n00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,430\nWe shared ideas, we shared techniques.\n\n450\n00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:44,340\nIf they had somebody that could\nteach a class and we didn't,\n\n451\n00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,690\nwe can put students in their class and\nthings like that.\n\n452\n00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:52,560\nSo we had a level of sharing going\non there, but we didn't necessarily\n\n453\n00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,770\nwant them selling into our districts or\nour areas, things like that.\n\n454\n00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,520\nThat stuff was still\nvery confidential to us.\n\n455\n00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,740\nOr even things like how much we happen\nto be charging for that product, or\n\n456\n00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,770\nthings like that, so.\n\n457\n00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:05,460\nDefinitely.\n\n458\n00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,530\nYou know, there's a lot of times when\nyou've got a partnership doesn't mean\n\n459\n00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,550\neverything, you know,\n\n460\n00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,610\nis going to be available to\nthe other side of that agreement.\n\n461\n00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,760\nYeah, I worked with\na company at one point,\n\n462\n00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:20,400\nwhere the one company had,\nI think, 13 different locations.\n\n463\n00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,580\nAnd they all had a common, literally\ninterconnected accounting software.\n\n464\n00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,880\nWhere you would run, you know it\nwas a restaurant type industry,\n\n465\n00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,650\nwhere you would run end of day sales, your\nlabor costs versus what your profit was.\n\n466\n00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,240\nAnd every day, the managers had\nto enter that information in.\n\n467\n00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:35,820\nRight.\n\n468\n00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,010\nWell, we brought in a company that\nwas gonna join in a partnership, and\n\n469\n00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,300\nwe were gonna become like 24 centers.\n\n470\n00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,552\nRight, okay.\nSo we had to give them a certain level\n\n471\n00:23:44,552 --> 00:23:48,216\nof access to that information to see\nif the profits were high enough,\n\n472\n00:23:48,216 --> 00:23:51,186\nwhatever the margin is or\nwhatever their numbers were,\n\n473\n00:23:51,186 --> 00:23:54,429\nto see that if they even wanted\nto enter into that agreement.\n\n474\n00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:57,316\nSo they can't just turn around and\ndisclose that information\n\n475\n00:23:57,316 --> 00:24:01,204\nto maybe another person That maybe they're\nconsidering joining a partnership and\n\n476\n00:24:01,204 --> 00:24:04,869\nsaying well we didn't really like their\nsales numbers this is what we've seen\n\n477\n00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:07,977\nwhile we're there, so we are gonna\njoin you, so it had to be very,\n\n478\n00:24:07,977 --> 00:24:10,840\nvery set and thoroughly documented\nbefore we ever go there.\n\n479\n00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,430\nAbsolutely.\n\n480\n00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,100\nRisk awareness, you know?\n\n481\n00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,660\nThe concept of risk awareness.\n\n482\n00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,470\nI wanna say that we have\ngot a whole other section.\n\n483\n00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,680\nI don't know if Ronnie\nhas done that one yet.\n\n484\n00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,060\nOr Nate, or\nif we're gonna do that later on.\n\n485\n00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,045\nWhere we talk about risk management.\n\n486\n00:24:25,045 --> 00:24:28,940\nCuz there's a whole procedure that we go\nthrough when we deal with risk management.\n\n487\n00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,390\nIdentifying our assets.\n\n488\n00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,750\nAssigning values to them.\n\n489\n00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,685\nTrying to find the vulnerabilities\nthat they might have and\n\n490\n00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:37,276\nthen threats they could\npotentially be exposed to.\n\n491\n00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:41,962\nBut risk awareness is general,\nwhen it comes to business partners\n\n492\n00:24:41,962 --> 00:24:46,240\nis making sure that we keep\nthe other side informed, right?\n\n493\n00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,220\nI mean like I was saying earlier, I could,\n\n494\n00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,840\nmy network could be not\nthe primary target.\n\n495\n00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,760\nBut a door way to attack their main\ntarget which is my business partner.\n\n496\n00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,380\nYes.\n\n497\n00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,820\nSo if I get compromised, right?\n\n498\n00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,630\nIt's my responsibility to\nlet that other side know.\n\n499\n00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,680\nTo let my partners know that hey,\nI have got a breach going on.\n\n500\n00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,950\nOr we had an incident last night.\n\n501\n00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:12,380\nI just wanted to make sure that you are\naware of this, we want to make sure that\n\n502\n00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,140\nwe curtailed it, we isolated it, or\nwhatever, we took care of the problem, but\n\n503\n00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,402\nthat's still something I\nneed to make you aware of.\n\n504\n00:25:19,402 --> 00:25:20,434\nYes, definitely.\n\n505\n00:25:20,434 --> 00:25:23,557\nYou don't want to try to\npretend it didn't happen, and\n\n506\n00:25:23,557 --> 00:25:27,809\nthere is a lot of companies that are going\nto try to do that because they don't\n\n507\n00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:29,745\nwant that egg on the face, right?\n\n508\n00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:34,954\nThey don't want their, you get a breach\nlike that and you lose reputation.\n\n509\n00:25:34,954 --> 00:25:39,330\nThat is right, I can give you a classic\nexample is DigiNotar, an external CA,\n\n510\n00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:43,450\nthat got their private key\ngot exploited and stolen.\n\n511\n00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,860\nAnd they tried to sweep\nit under the carpet.\n\n512\n00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,328\nAnd that's a trust model for\ne-commerce, you cannot do that.\n\n513\n00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:52,142\nAnd there is another one that did,\nthat also got attacked,\n\n514\n00:25:52,142 --> 00:25:55,971\nI think it was called Komodo, but the\ndifference was, they moment they found out\n\n515\n00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:59,030\nabout the security breach,\nthey did not even know where it was.\n\n516\n00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,176\nThey just said we know\nwe've been breached and\n\n517\n00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:03,937\nyou need to revoke every one\nof our certificates right now.\n\n518\n00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:07,559\nDigiNotar didn't do that,\nguess which business is still in business?\n\n519\n00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,799\nI'm gonna guess it's not DigiNotar.\n\n520\n00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:13,583\nSo, like Mike said, we'll talk in\nother episodes if we have not already\n\n521\n00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:16,138\nabout determining the risk\nto an organization.\n\n522\n00:26:16,138 --> 00:26:19,968\nBut when it comes to the partnership,\nwe have to make sure that each business is\n\n523\n00:26:19,968 --> 00:26:23,639\nthoroughly aware and can identify and\ndetermine the risks of the company.\n\n524\n00:26:23,639 --> 00:26:27,709\nAs well as when they enter into this\npartnership, to fully identify those risks\n\n525\n00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:30,999\nas part of the inner connection\nprocess and breaking that down.\n\n526\n00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:34,121\nAnd like you said,\nmaking sure that once we do break down or\n\n527\n00:26:34,121 --> 00:26:38,590\nterminate that connection,\nwe don't have backdoors in place.\n\n528\n00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,210\nAbsolutely.\nAnd\n\n529\n00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,126\nmaking sure that the other side is aware\nof the different technologies that you\n\n530\n00:26:42,126 --> 00:26:44,900\nare using that might not be\na part of the relationship.\n\n531\n00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,930\nBecause again, same concept,\n\n532\n00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:51,540\ntheir company could be the doorway\ninto mine, or vice versa.\n\n533\n00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,910\nAnd maybe they decided,\nI'm trying to think of a good example,\n\n534\n00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,440\nthat they don't use\nwireless in their network.\n\n535\n00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,187\nThey have decided that the risks\nassociated with having a wireless network\n\n536\n00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:03,610\nin their corporation is not worth it.\n\n537\n00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,210\nThe benefits don't outweigh the risks so\nthey decided no wireless.\n\n538\n00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,940\nWe need to let them know we run wireless.\n\n539\n00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,480\nThat's right.\n\n540\n00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,900\nSo that vulnerability even though\nnow you've decided not to do it so\n\n541\n00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,424\nthat you don't have that vulnerability,\nwe do.\n\n542\n00:27:15,424 --> 00:27:18,964\nWe have the bigger companies,\nfully embracing the BYOD.\n\n543\n00:27:18,964 --> 00:27:21,184\nAnd now we're tied together,\nso you now, in a sense,\n\n544\n00:27:21,184 --> 00:27:22,888\nhave that same vulnerability that we do.\n\n545\n00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:27,676\nSo just making sure that the other\nside is aware if any inherent risks\n\n546\n00:27:27,676 --> 00:27:33,060\ninvolved in creating a relationship\nwith our network and things like that.\n\n547\n00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,630\nUnauthorized data sharing is something\nthat we've gotta worry about as well.\n\n548\n00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,190\nAnd everything we talked about, this is\nnormal stuff that we look at in our own\n\n549\n00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,950\nnetworks that we have to deal with.\n\n550\n00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,271\nBut now we are talking about\na business partner and\n\n551\n00:27:47,271 --> 00:27:50,770\nit becomes much more difficult\nbecause they are not under my control.\n\n552\n00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:55,400\nIt adds another level of\ncomplexity to the whole thing.\n\n553\n00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,550\nCuz we worry about\nunauthorized data sharing.\n\n554\n00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,840\nI worry about my users taking data.\n\n555\n00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,130\nAnd giving it to the competition or\nsharing it in an inappropriate way.\n\n556\n00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,340\nPosting it into social media and\nthings like that.\n\n557\n00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,270\nOr storing information\nthat is copyrighted.\n\n558\n00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:09,770\nYeah.\n\n559\n00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:12,200\nWe have the right to just view, but\n\n560\n00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,580\nwe don't have the right to\ngo anywhere else with it.\n\n561\n00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,400\nYeah, sure.\n\n562\n00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,840\nBut data sharing is a part of that\nbusiness relationship, right?\n\n563\n00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,559\nI mean, that is kind of why,\nusually that is one of the big reasons\n\n564\n00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,790\nwea are making that relationship\nin the first place.\n\n565\n00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,980\nSo, I've gotta share the information.\n\n566\n00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:33,940\nAnd I can control how much of the data\nis being shared, I have access control\n\n567\n00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:38,080\nlists and things like that that we can use\nto control what data is being shared but\n\n568\n00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,755\nthe problem is that, like comp table\nwill tell you, it is the human element.\n\n569\n00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:47,267\n[CROSSTALK] take that control\nright out of my hands.\n\n570\n00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:51,439\nI give them read access to this file but\nall of a sudden they throw it on a thumb\n\n571\n00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:55,830\ndrive and take it with them and now they\ncan share it outside the organization.\n\n572\n00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,600\nOr, they email an attachment\noutside the partnership,\n\n573\n00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,080\nthat has details they should not be\nexposed outside of that partnership.\n\n574\n00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,130\nYeah, definitely.\n\n575\n00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,550\nWhen organizations are getting together\nlike this, they use data exchange and\n\n576\n00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:13,680\ndata exchange standards and it's all part\nof your information exchange security.\n\n577\n00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,840\nAnd making sure that when you\nare exchanging that information or\n\n578\n00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,230\nat least exposing that\ninformation to a partner.\n\n579\n00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,305\nThat it doesn't inadvertently\nend up in the wrong spot.\n\n580\n00:29:22,305 --> 00:29:24,230\n[LAUGH] Wherever that spot might be.\n\n581\n00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:27,554\nCreating things like non disclosure,\ncannot even say it,\n\n582\n00:29:27,554 --> 00:29:29,220\nnon disclosure agreements.\n\n583\n00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,860\nMaking sure that we fully\nunderstand that this data\n\n584\n00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,690\nis not to go out of the hands of whatever\nthe company or party is involved.\n\n585\n00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,610\nAll right, ladies and gentlemen,\nI tell you what, that brings us to a good\n\n586\n00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:43,070\nbreaking point and we're right about\nat the end of our first segment here.\n\n587\n00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:47,220\nSo why don't we stop there, take a quick\nlittle break and refill the drinks or\n\n588\n00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,930\nwhatever else we gotta do and we will\nmeet you back here in a few minutes.\n\n589\n00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,604\nSounds good.\n\n590\n00:29:52,604 --> 00:29:59,729\n[SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n591\n00:29:59,729 --> 00:30:03,188\nWe left off with unauthorized\ndata sharing, so\n\n592\n00:30:03,188 --> 00:30:09,220\nwe will just pick it up right there,\nif I could say that in proper English.\n\n593\n00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,540\nWe are gonna move on\ninto a couple of topics.\n\n594\n00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,960\nData ownership and data backups.\n\n595\n00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,280\nWhen it comes to data ownerships, these\nare gonna be the policies that define you.\n\n596\n00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,588\nBasically, who owns the data?\n\n597\n00:30:20,588 --> 00:30:23,610\nWho actually owns the data?\n\n598\n00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:27,530\nAnd sharing it with third\nparties is going to\n\n599\n00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:31,460\nintroduce some new legal concepts that\nwe have gotta, legal ramifications for\n\n600\n00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,950\nemployees who engage in\nunauthorized sharing.\n\n601\n00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:38,062\nBecause now all of a sudden, I'm not\ntalking about, it could be, if we get\n\n602\n00:30:38,062 --> 00:30:42,438\na business partnership with another\norganization, and I have access to some of\n\n603\n00:30:42,438 --> 00:30:46,906\ntheir data, all their employees understand\nthat, that data can't be shared.\n\n604\n00:30:46,906 --> 00:30:51,842\nBut now all of a sudden, I've got to\nworry, me, or if I'm from the other side,\n\n605\n00:30:51,842 --> 00:30:56,487\nI've got to worry about I've exposed\nthis data to this business partner or\n\n606\n00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:59,437\ntheir employees as\nconscientious as mine are or\n\n607\n00:30:59,437 --> 00:31:03,786\nmine have been trained to be to making\nsure that data's kept safe, and\n\n608\n00:31:03,786 --> 00:31:08,174\nthat we're not doing any unauthorized\nsharing of that information.\n\n609\n00:31:08,174 --> 00:31:12,718\nYeah definitely, this whole integration\nprocess we've really got to clearly\n\n610\n00:31:12,718 --> 00:31:17,260\ndefine which information can be viewed\nby the partner, which information is to\n\n611\n00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:21,420\nremain confidential and like you said\nyou're not allowed to view that.\n\n612\n00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,836\nEven our employees know that.\n\n613\n00:31:22,836 --> 00:31:26,510\nWhat can be viewed, what can be copied,\n\n614\n00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:30,530\nwhat can be removed by the third\nparties within that agreement?\n\n615\n00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:33,480\nAnd what do we do if let's say\nif my business partner one\n\n616\n00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,980\nof their employees does leak some data?\n\n617\n00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,870\nWhat can I do?\n\n618\n00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,070\nWhat am I allowed to?\n\n619\n00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,390\nCan I prosecute that person,\nthings like that?\n\n620\n00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:44,220\nDo we have an agreement with that partner\nthat says look we won't take him to court\n\n621\n00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,560\nor sue your company, as long as you\nmake sure you do step A, step B, and\n\n622\n00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,990\ntake care of the problem or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n623\n00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:51,700\nThat's right.\n\n624\n00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,270\nCivil litigation or\ndue diligence on their part.\n\n625\n00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,900\nYeah, right, exactly.\n\n626\n00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,038\nAnd then data backup.\n\n627\n00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,354\nWe've talked in plenty of episodes\nabout what a data backup is and\n\n628\n00:32:00,354 --> 00:32:03,202\ndifferent types of data backup,\nand things like that.\n\n629\n00:32:03,202 --> 00:32:06,523\nBut think about the backup itself, right?\n\n630\n00:32:06,523 --> 00:32:08,250\nThat is a copy of all that data.\n\n631\n00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,430\nWho's doing those backups?\n\n632\n00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:14,930\nIs the other part, is the data I own,\nis that partner allowed to or\n\n633\n00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,600\ncan they back up that information?\n\n634\n00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,320\nSure, sure.\n\n635\n00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,190\nAnd if they do, you know, we've got\ncertain retention policies on our side\n\n636\n00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,850\nthat define how long I'm going\nto maintain those backups for.\n\n637\n00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,520\nHow often I need to do those backups,\nthings like that.\n\n638\n00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,780\nThere might be information in\nthose backups that's volatile,\n\n639\n00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,340\nthat expires after a certain\nperiod of time, sales quotes,\n\n640\n00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:37,280\nthings like that, prices change over time,\nagreements change.\n\n641\n00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,880\nIf they've got a backup of my\ndata from way in the past,\n\n642\n00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,280\nthey could try to pull some of\nthat out and use that against us,\n\n643\n00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,570\nso the backups always tell people,\nthat's all of your data.\n\n644\n00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:49,250\nYeah.\nI mean,\n\n645\n00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,220\nthose backups contain a good\nchunk of your information.\n\n646\n00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,430\nSo you've got to treat\nthose backups themselves,\n\n647\n00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,320\njust like you do your data, right.\n\n648\n00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:57,900\nI mean.\n\n649\n00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,600\nDefinitely.\nGot to\n\n650\n00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,545\nmake sure that not the wrong person\ndoesn't have access to the backup,\n\n651\n00:33:01,545 --> 00:33:03,770\nhave the ability to try to\ndo a restore with that data.\n\n652\n00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:04,990\nMm-hm.\n\n653\n00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,730\nThose backups, and\ntry to get access to that information.\n\n654\n00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,910\nIt's data retention.\n\n655\n00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:12,460\nI mean, if you look at it any backup\nstrategy, I mean like as you mentioned,\n\n656\n00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,290\nwe talk about in other episodes as\nwell but I mean it's data retention.\n\n657\n00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:20,160\nAnd when we have a backup strategy, a lot\nof times we keep our most current backups\n\n658\n00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,840\non site but oh,\nwe also keep some of them offsite.\n\n659\n00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,470\nAnd now when you have them in a different\nlocation, now is that location a secure?\n\n660\n00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,490\nYou know, so\nagain volatile data you might not,\n\n661\n00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,490\nyou might not be allowed\nto retain that information.\n\n662\n00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:37,320\nRight.\nSo we have to clearly define what\n\n663\n00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,230\ndata can be retained and\nnot as well as viewed and copied.\n\n664\n00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,530\nBut I mean, it's essentially a copy.\n\n665\n00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:46,089\nAnd what data can't leave\nthe internal infrastructure at all.\n\n666\n00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:46,646\nThat's right, that's right.\n\n667\n00:33:46,646 --> 00:33:50,373\nAnd then they're gonna to sum\nup the Objective 2.2 with\n\n668\n00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:52,740\nsome pretty basic statements here.\n\n669\n00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,130\nThey just say follow security policies and\nprocedures.\n\n670\n00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:01,740\nWe got through all the time and\neffort to generate these BPA's and\n\n671\n00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,420\nthese SOA's, or\nSLA's I should say things like this.\n\n672\n00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,090\nNow we've gotta actually follow them,\nright?\n\n673\n00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,060\nWe've got to implicate them, and\n\n674\n00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,140\nwe've got to make sure that we are in\ncompliance with those policies.\n\n675\n00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,567\nIf we set up an agreement with\nthis partner organization,\n\n676\n00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:17,900\nwe darn sure better stick\nwith that agreement, right?\n\n677\n00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:22,230\nJust like we expect them to stick with the\nagreement and follow what we've laid out.\n\n678\n00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,800\nWe gotta do the same thing.\n\n679\n00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,030\nYeah, and same thing, we might have\nto determine policy revision, too.\n\n680\n00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,530\nMaybe we've developed it, but\nlike you said with the wireless and\n\n681\n00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,970\none company doesn't have wireless,\nwell maybe the security policy,\n\n682\n00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:37,550\nwhatever the policy might\nbe that we've set up,\n\n683\n00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:42,260\nwe have to revise it, or review it if you\nwill to determine that it's adequate for\n\n684\n00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,964\nboth companies and\nboth companies' continuity.\n\n685\n00:34:44,964 --> 00:34:46,450\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n\n686\n00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:49,480\nAnd as you said,\nwe've said it a hundred times.\n\n687\n00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,090\nIt's a very dynamic environment.\n\n688\n00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:56,960\nThings change and now all of a sudden,\nwe've brought in another organization or\n\n689\n00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,960\nmultiple partners and\nthat just makes it more dynamic.\n\n690\n00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,170\nSo this stuff is not something that\nyou do once and forget about it.\n\n691\n00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:07,850\nThis is the kind of thing that you have to\ngo back and look at periodically whether\n\n692\n00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:12,430\nthat's semi-annually or\nquarterly or monthly or bimonthly.\n\n693\n00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:15,220\nDefinitely You know depending on\nhow dynamic the information is or\n\n694\n00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,560\nthe agreements are.\n\n695\n00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,790\nWe've got to make sure that we're\ngoing back and we're looking at those.\n\n696\n00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,430\nAnd we also have to go back and pull\nthem out once in a while and let's see,\n\n697\n00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,640\nlet's make sure I'm still\nin compliance with this.\n\n698\n00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,300\nYep.\nYou know,\n\n699\n00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,360\nI don't remember exactly what we agreed\nto, or was that part of my agreement?\n\n700\n00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,230\nAm I maintaining that compliance?\n\n701\n00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,300\nHas somebody made some changes in my\nnetwork that have brought it out of\n\n702\n00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:41,320\ncompliance with this agreement that\nwe've made with this other organization?\n\n703\n00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,210\nAnd making sure that we're providing\nadequate performance as well.\n\n704\n00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:45,830\nThat's right.\n\n705\n00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:46,670\nYep, definitely.\n\n706\n00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,940\nAll right,\nwell that pretty much kills off 2.2.\n\n707\n00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:57,150\nWe're going to jump over to 2.5 next.\n\n708\n00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,149\nAnd just a little FYI,\n\n709\n00:35:58,149 --> 00:36:01,671\nI know most of you probably weren't even\npaying attention when I said this, but\n\n710\n00:36:01,671 --> 00:36:04,787\nat the very beginning I did call out\nthe objectives we were going over.\n\n711\n00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:12,318\nThe new exam, it's not SYS, it's\nSY0401 for the CompTIA Security+ exam.\n\n712\n00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:13,370\nIt's another acronym.\n\n713\n00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,147\nSecure your systems.\n\n714\n00:36:14,147 --> 00:36:15,100\n[LAUGH] I know right?\n\n715\n00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,330\nIf you guys go out to the website and\nyou try to register for an exam and\n\n716\n00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:21,250\nyou're looking for Security+,\nyou're going to find it.\n\n717\n00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,200\nYou're not going to have to\nworry about that, all right?\n\n718\n00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,910\nBut just in case it is SY0401, not SYS401.\n\n719\n00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:32,451\nAll right, but SY0401 objective 2.5,\n\n720\n00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:35,880\nsummarize common incident\nresponse procedures.\n\n721\n00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,620\nAll kinds of more fun stuff.\n\n722\n00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:42,460\nWhat do we do when we have a breach,\nwhen we have an incident, and\n\n723\n00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,620\nwe're not gonna break it\ndown too detailed here.\n\n724\n00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,610\nThere's really just more of a summary,\nwe've got a couple others we're gonna\n\n725\n00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:51,070\nkinda break it down step by step on\nwhat we might do in an instant response.\n\n726\n00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:54,400\nThat's right they'll go over\nthe full in-depth IRPs and\n\n727\n00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,250\nincident response policies and remember\nthat some of the steps that we're going to\n\n728\n00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,620\ntalk about is going to be directly related\nto that other episode where we talk about\n\n729\n00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,830\nincident response policies and\nthe individual components of that policy.\n\n730\n00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,861\nWe're just going to review some of those\nconcepts that would be included in\n\n731\n00:37:08,861 --> 00:37:09,545\nthat location.\n\n732\n00:37:09,545 --> 00:37:12,917\nAnd the first thing we\nhave to do is preparation.\n\n733\n00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:16,551\nI don't if you can see I have\na lot of notes typed up, but\n\n734\n00:37:16,551 --> 00:37:20,690\nI'll add some more before we\npost these notes up on the site.\n\n735\n00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:23,500\nAnd when it comes to preparing for\nincident response,\n\n736\n00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,792\nwe've got to plan it out.\n\n737\n00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:30,200\nWe've got to think about what we're\ngoing to do before the incident occurs.\n\n738\n00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,930\nBecause once the incident occurs people\nare not thinking clearly, decision\n\n739\n00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:40,000\nmaking process is gonna be sporadic or\nrushed.\n\n740\n00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,330\nIt's not gonna be very thought through so\nwe really want to make sure that we plan\n\n741\n00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,930\nout what we're gonna do in\nthe event of an incident.\n\n742\n00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:50,860\nAnd that's gonna include, you know,\npicking the people that are gonna be part\n\n743\n00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:54,810\nof the incident response team,\nsetting up report plans and\n\n744\n00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:58,940\nwho's gonna be notified in the event of\nan incident, how we're gonna go about\n\n745\n00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:04,750\ndealing with the situation\nthat when an incident occurs.\n\n746\n00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,440\nSo good preparation.\n\n747\n00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,030\nWhat was it that Charlie\nused to say all the time?\n\n748\n00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,550\nPiss poor planning.\n\n749\n00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,660\nI can't remember what he said,\n\n750\n00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,880\nhe used to have a funny little acronym\nthat he'd use, I'll have to think of that.\n\n751\n00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,980\nCarpenter's say measure twice, cut once.\n\n752\n00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,536\nThat's right.\n\n753\n00:38:19,536 --> 00:38:21,590\n[LAUGH] I don't even know if that\neven falls under the same line.\n\n754\n00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,210\nIt's the exact same idea.\n\n755\n00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,370\nExactly, exactly.\n\n756\n00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,240\nWe don't want to wait\nuntil we're frantic and\n\n757\n00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,262\nwe have some kind of incident\ngoing on saying what do we do?\n\n758\n00:38:30,262 --> 00:38:35,150\n[LAUGH] So the preparation just means\nthat we can prepare in a non-volatile\n\n759\n00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,321\nenvironment.\n\n760\n00:38:36,321 --> 00:38:41,550\nHopefully stress free, not waiting\nuntil everything's going haywire and\n\n761\n00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,590\nnow we've got to figure out,\nwell what do we do?\n\n762\n00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:48,840\nAnd so that first thing they talk about\nthere is incident identification.\n\n763\n00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,010\nAnd this is a really important part of it.\n\n764\n00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,820\nDoesn't it seem like, what do you mean,\nan incident identification.\n\n765\n00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,340\nI mean, you know when there's a breach.\n\n766\n00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,540\nWell, do you know when there's a breach?\n\n767\n00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,703\nThat's right.\nWhat defines what an incident is and\n\n768\n00:39:00,703 --> 00:39:04,610\nsometimes that can be\ntrickier than you think.\n\n769\n00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,520\nI can give you an example.\n\n770\n00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,160\nSomebody calls up,\nthe boss calls you up on the phone.\n\n771\n00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:14,300\nAnd we've got a policy in place that\nsays let me think of a better example.\n\n772\n00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,540\nYou know,\nwe've got a policy in place that says,\n\n773\n00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,510\nin order to get your account unlocked,\n\n774\n00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:24,930\nyou have to go down to the IT department\nand you have to explain what happened.\n\n775\n00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,080\nAnd you have to be there\nphysically in person.\n\n776\n00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,650\nTo get that account unlocked because\nwe were trying to prevent any\n\n777\n00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,390\npassword guessing.\n\n778\n00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:30,930\nThat's right.\n\n779\n00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,040\nIdentification before authentication.\n\n780\n00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,140\nSo the boss calls you up and says hey\nlook, my account has been locked out,\n\n781\n00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,860\nI'm in the middle of a meeting, I've got\nto get my password reset right now so\n\n782\n00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,210\nwe can continue on with the meeting.\n\n783\n00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,380\nWell, that doesn't follow procedure,\nright?\n\n784\n00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,230\nRight.\n\n785\n00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,920\nSo you know it's your boss.\n\n786\n00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,650\nYou recognize the voice on the phone.\n\n787\n00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:52,310\nBut it's not following procedure.\n\n788\n00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:55,810\nIs it a security breach or is it not?\n\n789\n00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,644\nIn this case, it wouldn't be.\n\n790\n00:39:58,644 --> 00:40:02,143\nSo you've gotta be able to define, now\nwhether you actually reset the password,\n\n791\n00:40:02,143 --> 00:40:04,390\nthat's a moral decision\nthat we have to make there.\n\n792\n00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:08,767\nYou know, that's a Something that we'd\nthat, it's a whole nother discussion.\n\n793\n00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:10,720\nBut it wouldn't be a breach.\n\n794\n00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,410\nBut if I.\n\n795\n00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:15,740\nI need to be sure I classify it that\nway I guess is what I'm trying to say.\n\n796\n00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,160\nYou got to understand what is\nconsidered an actual breach.\n\n797\n00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,170\nAn incident doesn't necessarily\nmean that anything was compromised.\n\n798\n00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:23,810\nThat's right.\n\n799\n00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:27,110\nIt could just be the attempt\nto gain access to some data.\n\n800\n00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:32,000\nWhere I see log files on my router\nshow port scans, one after another.\n\n801\n00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,770\nAnd then these attempts to telnet\nto all these different ports,\n\n802\n00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,800\ntrying to make connections.\n\n803\n00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,940\nThey never connected.\n\n804\n00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,190\nThey never got anything.\n\n805\n00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:41,390\nThat's still considered an incident,\nright?\n\n806\n00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,350\nNow organizations, you know,\n\n807\n00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:46,430\nis thoroughly determining\nthe threats to their organization.\n\n808\n00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:50,920\nWhat resource could potentially be\naffected as a result of those threats.\n\n809\n00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:56,350\nAnd we'll talk a little bit more about\nBIA, the business impact analysis.\n\n810\n00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:59,240\nYou know,\njust that thorough identification.\n\n811\n00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:03,450\nOf what could lead to an incident.\n\n812\n00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:06,310\nIt say incident but going further\nthen that a violation of security\n\n813\n00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,970\npolicy's a formal defamation\nof a security breech.\n\n814\n00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:12,280\nWhat will lead to those\npotential security breeches?\n\n815\n00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,160\nSo really what it comes down to is\nmaking sure that we can identify\n\n816\n00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,940\nwhat the thread is, what is it that\nwe're being exposed to at this point,\n\n817\n00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:22,580\nwhat are the effects that it's\nhaving on my system on my network.\n\n818\n00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,850\nWhat problems is it causing.\n\n819\n00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,986\nMaking sure we're keeping track\nof when this is occuring,\n\n820\n00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,280\nwhat systems are being infected.\n\n821\n00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:35,980\nWhat we saw happening you know I\nsaw the screen locked or something.\n\n822\n00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,550\nThe command prompt window opened up,\n\n823\n00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:41,430\nand commands started scrolling by on\nthis terminal in my server closet.\n\n824\n00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:48,465\nDoing a backup of everything once the\nintrusion was observed, and making a copy.\n\n825\n00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:50,574\n[CROSSTALK] Like that system\nevidence stuff for forensics.\n\n826\n00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:54,473\n[CROSSTALK] Exactly, trying to capture as\nmuch evidence as I can of the breach or\n\n827\n00:41:54,473 --> 00:41:55,314\nof the incident.\n\n828\n00:41:55,314 --> 00:41:59,458\nSo that we can use that later on,\nto either figure out how they got in,\n\n829\n00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:01,610\nand protect ourselves against it.\n\n830\n00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:05,150\nOr use it in a court of law, if we find\nthe people, and try to prosecute them.\n\n831\n00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,500\nWhen you look at Mike's notes up there\ntoo, you know, the next thing we get into,\n\n832\n00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,150\nand we'll get into this in a second,\nescalation and notification.\n\n833\n00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:14,570\nI mean,\nwhen you look at incident identification,\n\n834\n00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:17,480\nit helps to properly\nscope the incident too.\n\n835\n00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,080\nIf we need to report this to somebody,\nwe need to be able to classify it.\n\n836\n00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,780\nYou know, properly scope it so that we\ncan identify who is going to be that\n\n837\n00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:29,200\nresponder, the person that we're going to\nescalate this too, which we'll get into in\n\n838\n00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,860\na second, but to properly scope it is\nto help manage that response as well.\n\n839\n00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,690\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n\n840\n00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:38,300\nYeah, when I look at escalation\nnotification, who do you notify?\n\n841\n00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:42,700\nIf it's a I don't know.\n\n842\n00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,220\nDoes somebody got an IP address from us.\n\n843\n00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:49,850\nUnauthorized user got an IP\naddress from my IDH server right?\n\n844\n00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,690\nDo I call the CEO?\n\n845\n00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:54,290\nDo I wake him up out of bed at 3\no'clock in the morning just cause\n\n846\n00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,700\nsomebody got an IP address\nfrom my IDH server?\n\n847\n00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,970\nProbably not.\n\n848\n00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:02,420\nIf somebody accesses SQL database where it\nhas all my customer information in it and\n\n849\n00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:07,880\nI can see them moving files off of this\nserver, maybe I do notify the CEO.\n\n850\n00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,510\nKnowing who you're supposed to\nnotify based on the incident.\n\n851\n00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:14,540\nWhether or not we even have\nthe authority to make that decision.\n\n852\n00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:18,430\nDo we escalate it up to somebody else,\nand let them make that decision.\n\n853\n00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,410\nWhat's that next step.\n\n854\n00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:23,720\nAnd you have a couple of different,\nlike Mike talked about but here,\n\n855\n00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,180\nyou've got a couple of\ndifferent types of escalation.\n\n856\n00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,510\nYou've got a functional\nescalation is just hey,\n\n857\n00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:33,600\ndo we turn this over to somebody that\njust has higher technical level or\n\n858\n00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:38,230\nis it more of hierarchical escalation\nwhich says this needs to go to a manager\n\n859\n00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:42,040\nbecause only the manager right now has the\nauthority or the jurisdiction to provide\n\n860\n00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,750\na response according to how\nwe've scoped that incident.\n\n861\n00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,670\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n862\n00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:48,685\nYou might have the technical\nskills to bring the website down.\n\n863\n00:43:48,685 --> 00:43:52,050\n[LAUGH] You know, to shut that database\ndown so nobody can get any more\n\n864\n00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:56,090\ninformation out of it, but do you have\nthe authority, as you said, to do it?\n\n865\n00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:00,330\nWhat if you make that decision and\nthat starts costing the company\n\n866\n00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:03,680\nhundreds of thousands of dollars an hour\nbecause you decided to shut this down.\n\n867\n00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,790\nDid you have the authority\nto make that decision?\n\n868\n00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:10,020\nAnd you want to make sure that we follow.\n\n869\n00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,050\nAgain, that all has to be\nlaid out in these plans, so\n\n870\n00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,050\nthat we can stick within those guidelines.\n\n871\n00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:16,020\nThat's right.\n\n872\n00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,360\nIt'd be proper classification.\n\n873\n00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:22,520\nIs this a high level security incident\nthat has to go to managerial,\n\n874\n00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,710\nmaybe we have a color chart.\n\n875\n00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:24,970\nI love pictures.\n\n876\n00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:26,793\nBooks are great when they have pictures.\n\n877\n00:44:26,793 --> 00:44:28,700\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] But\nmaybe that's in the red level.\n\n878\n00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,110\nWe have a yellow level that says okay,\nwell,\n\n879\n00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:35,200\nwe need to get this to like\nmaybe a Tier 3 Network Engineer.\n\n880\n00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,480\nWe've got, okay, this is in the green\nlevel there, well, maybe help desk and\n\n881\n00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,690\nhelp remedy the problem and\n\n882\n00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:43,700\nif they can't maybe they just escalate\nit up to that one tier above them.\n\n883\n00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:48,480\nIt gets all the way up to def con four and\nthat's when we break out the big guns And\n\n884\n00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,710\nyou know it's a good point that you say\nthat, you might end up having to pull in\n\n885\n00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:57,860\na third party that says, Hey, we can't do\nthis with any of our internal resources.\n\n886\n00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:02,600\nMaybe we need to outsource this to\nsome kind of security analysis team.\n\n887\n00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,470\nI don't know what you would,\nI'm thinking pen testing, but you know.\n\n888\n00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,050\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n889\n00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:09,860\nYou might have a contract with\nan organization that handles\n\n890\n00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:11,430\nincident responses and comes in and\n\n891\n00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:15,580\nhandles all the forensics cause we've\ntalked about it later on in this class.\n\n892\n00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:19,550\nWe'll discuss not this episode but\nlater on in another episode.\n\n893\n00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,850\nWe'll discuss some of the skills\nrequired to do the forensic analysis.\n\n894\n00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:26,110\nAnd the you know,\nit takes specialized equipment.\n\n895\n00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,665\nWe'll talk about order volatility.\n\n896\n00:45:28,665 --> 00:45:30,527\n[CROSSTALK] Stuff like that,\nthat we have to deal with.\n\n897\n00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:34,103\nAnd, it might get to the point\nwhere you don't have that skill or\n\n898\n00:45:34,103 --> 00:45:35,573\nthat expertise in house.\n\n899\n00:45:35,573 --> 00:45:38,018\nOr you might have to do,\nif you want to prosecute,\n\n900\n00:45:38,018 --> 00:45:40,830\nyou might have to consider\nbringing in the authorities.\n\n901\n00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:43,852\nRight, whether that's the local police,\nor whether that's the state\n\n902\n00:45:43,852 --> 00:45:46,584\npolice [CROSSTALK] and\ntheir computer crimes people, or the FBI.\n\n903\n00:45:46,584 --> 00:45:48,315\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah, local,\nstate and federal.\n\n904\n00:45:48,315 --> 00:45:50,538\n[CROSSTALK] You've gotta\nagain Planned out.\n\n905\n00:45:50,538 --> 00:45:53,030\nWho am I supposed to notify?\n\n906\n00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:56,500\nHow high does this go up when we do\ndecide to escalate this problem?\n\n907\n00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,440\nWhat if we have cloud integration?\n\n908\n00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,550\nIt's not even our network.\n\n909\n00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:03,520\nWe've got information\nthat's stored in other, and\n\n910\n00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,720\nI'm not by any means picking on Amazon.\n\n911\n00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,120\nBut what if we're using something\nlike their elastic compute?\n\n912\n00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:12,000\nYou know and there's for whatever\nreason there is a security breach.\n\n913\n00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,370\nWell, now how does that effect\ninternally and how can we\n\n914\n00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:19,250\nrespond to that when that information\nis in a 3rd party's infrastructure.\n\n915\n00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:22,570\nSo we also gotta think about\nthe integration with cloud computing too.\n\n916\n00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:25,640\nIs that our data might\nnot be stored locally.\n\n917\n00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:32,860\nIt might not even be in our local site,\nso many different things that could.\n\n918\n00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,810\nWe might even have to\noutsource that completely.\n\n919\n00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:35,810\nAbsolutely.\n\n920\n00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:41,350\nOnce an incident has occurred we've got\ncertain mitigation steps that we're\n\n921\n00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:44,260\ngoing to try to follow so\nthat we can deal with this issue.\n\n922\n00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:47,390\nWe've talked about escalating\nit up if necessary.\n\n923\n00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:49,440\nNotifying the right people.\n\n924\n00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,870\nWhat do I do about the incident itself?\n\n925\n00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:55,425\nIf that incident is ongoing,\nwhat do we do?\n\n926\n00:46:55,425 --> 00:46:55,960\nMm-hm.\n\n927\n00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,830\nAnd we talk about, I can't remember\nif it's in this set of objectives or\n\n928\n00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:01,730\nnot but Mm-hm.\n\n929\n00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:03,830\nWe'll talk about do I\nshut that machine down?\n\n930\n00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:04,900\nRight.\n\n931\n00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,170\nThat's the first thing people want to do,\n\n932\n00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:08,270\nright is they want to yank that\npower cord out of the server Mm-hm.\n\n933\n00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:11,290\nMm-hm.\nOr something like that and you lose,\n\n934\n00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:14,270\nyou stand the chance to lose a lot of\nevidence because we do have a lot of\n\n935\n00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:15,435\nvolatile like RAM.\n\n936\n00:47:15,435 --> 00:47:17,020\nMm-hm.\nEverything that's in there,\n\n937\n00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,020\nis going to be gone, right?\n\n938\n00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:18,630\nIt's gone.\n\n939\n00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:23,060\nWell it's kind of like Ronnie and Nate\nsaid this morning, with some of the annual\n\n940\n00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:26,230\nloss expectancies and all that\njargon that we were talking about.\n\n941\n00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:29,110\nYou might determine that mitigation\nisn't required because it's\n\n942\n00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:31,180\nnot worth our time and trouble to do it.\n\n943\n00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,770\nAgain, if it's a low level security\nincident, that's how you classify\n\n944\n00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:40,190\nRight Maybe the, whatever the mediation\nstep is more expensive than whatever\n\n945\n00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:44,870\nthe resource is that we're concerned about\ntoo, and mitigation we don't really, we\n\n946\n00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:49,370\ncan't eliminate everything We could just\nbring it down to that acceptable level.\n\n947\n00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:51,780\nIf this happens this is how we respond.\n\n948\n00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,750\nIf this happens, well we're just going\nto kind of pretend it didn't happen.\n\n949\n00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,528\nExactly.\nBecause it just doesn't,\n\n950\n00:47:57,528 --> 00:48:00,056\nwhy spend $50,000 dollars to save 500?\n\n951\n00:48:00,056 --> 00:48:00,663\nExactly.\n\n952\n00:48:00,663 --> 00:48:04,308\nWe might decide that we offload\nthe responsibility to somebody else.\n\n953\n00:48:04,308 --> 00:48:08,000\nWe got insurance, or like you said.\n\n954\n00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:08,783\nNot worried about it.\n\n955\n00:48:08,783 --> 00:48:12,726\nIt's just not worth protecting\nthe end result of a breach of this\n\n956\n00:48:12,726 --> 00:48:13,902\nparticular type.\n\n957\n00:48:13,902 --> 00:48:18,436\nIt's not going to,\nthe cost to protect against that\n\n958\n00:48:18,436 --> 00:48:23,146\nattack would much outweigh the-\nThe results that you'd get at the end and\n\n959\n00:48:23,146 --> 00:48:26,150\njust say, okay, we will just cut it\nas a loss and move on from here.\n\n960\n00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,430\nYes, exactly.\n\n961\n00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:32,020\nAnd I'm gonna jump down a little bit\nthere in our list of objectives,\n\n962\n00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:36,960\ncuz part of our mitigation steps,\nwe talk about incident isolation.\n\n963\n00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,220\nAnd that's another thing, what do we do\nif we've got an incident occurring or\n\n964\n00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:43,600\nan incident has occurred.\n\n965\n00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,840\nSo do we,\none of the options is quarantine.\n\n966\n00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,410\nRight.\n\n967\n00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:48,500\nSegregate that out.\n\n968\n00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:52,850\nThat server that's being compromised\nthat the bad guy is attacking,\n\n969\n00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:54,140\ndo we segregate it out?\n\n970\n00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:54,925\nQuarantine it?\n\n971\n00:48:54,925 --> 00:48:56,300\nSeparate from the rest of the network.\n\n972\n00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:01,050\nAgain, this is stuff that has\nto be thought out ahead of time.\n\n973\n00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:04,580\nIf I just yank the network cable out\nof that machine, I stop the attack.\n\n974\n00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,410\nRight.\nAssuming that the attack is coming\n\n975\n00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:07,025\nacross the network.\n\n976\n00:49:07,025 --> 00:49:08,005\nMm-hm.\nBut,\n\n977\n00:49:08,005 --> 00:49:11,595\nnow what I've done is the bad guy\nnow knows I'm on to him, right?\n\n978\n00:49:11,595 --> 00:49:16,785\nSo I lose any chance of maybe\nbeing able to trace it back, or\n\n979\n00:49:16,785 --> 00:49:20,360\nback to where that guy's coming from,\nor where that attack's coming from.\n\n980\n00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:26,010\nSo maybe we don't, we quarantine it off,\nbut we let the attack occur.\n\n981\n00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:26,730\nWe're limiting it.\n\n982\n00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:27,760\nKinda like the honeypot.\n\n983\n00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,050\nYeah.\nNot that we're doing that.\n\n984\n00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:29,990\nNot intentionally.\n\n985\n00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:32,415\nBut we now have our forced honeypot.\n\n986\n00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,290\n[LAUGH] Well,\nI guess we're gonna implement it now so\n\n987\n00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:36,320\nthat we can track it back to the source.\n\n988\n00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:36,830\nExactly.\nSo\n\n989\n00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:39,890\nI can isolate it from the rest of\nthe network to try to limit the damage to\n\n990\n00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:42,430\nprevent that attack from\nspreading to other machines, but\n\n991\n00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:44,290\nI can continue to collect evidence.\n\n992\n00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:46,620\nI can continue to log things he's doing.\n\n993\n00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:49,700\nAnd I can try to gather it that way, or\n\n994\n00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,640\nit might be that the information that's\non that machine is so valuable that I've\n\n995\n00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:59,230\ngotta stop it right now, and so\nI can remove the device from the network.\n\n996\n00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:02,170\nAnd now we're talking about removing it,\n\n997\n00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:06,660\nand then typically, bagging and tagging\nit, to use a TV expression or something.\n\n998\n00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,970\nAnd that's, start your chain of custody.\n\n999\n00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:12,560\nYou take that hardware,\nyou pull it from the network,\n\n1000\n00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:17,080\nyou remove the device, and now you bag\nthis stuff up and you label it and\n\n1001\n00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:21,300\nyou start that chain of custody so\nwe can do forensic investigations on it.\n\n1002\n00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,340\nAnd that information will\nhold up in a court of law.\n\n1003\n00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:26,200\nYep.\nIf we don't do it properly,\n\n1004\n00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,375\nwe can't take it In the court, and\nthen we lose our chance to prosecute.\n\n1005\n00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:32,855\nAnd we really need to determine,\nis the incident over?\n\n1006\n00:50:33,945 --> 00:50:37,595\nI mean, has this incident stopped?\n\n1007\n00:50:37,595 --> 00:50:41,500\nSo, in the quarantine process, we gotta\nfigure out what systems are affected.\n\n1008\n00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,480\nWe also gotta figure out are more\nsystems still being affected and\n\n1009\n00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,170\nwe just don't know it?\n\n1010\n00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:46,240\nExactly, exactly.\n\n1011\n00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,390\nLet's see what else we should talk about.\n\n1012\n00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:55,540\nLessons learned is another technique\nthat we can use when we've\n\n1013\n00:50:55,540 --> 00:51:00,450\ndealt with this type of attack before or\nwe've seen these port scans before and\n\n1014\n00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:04,840\nwe know that in the end they're not\nable to get through, so we can use that\n\n1015\n00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,190\ninformation to help us plan what we'll\ndo in the next time we see that attack.\n\n1016\n00:51:09,190 --> 00:51:12,970\nFaster response times, better isolation,\nbetter quarantine, sure.\n\n1017\n00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:15,480\nOr it could be from partner organizations.\n\n1018\n00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,450\nOr other organizations that\nmaybe have dealt with that.\n\n1019\n00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:22,840\nMaybe you have never seen this particular\ntype of attack, but you know your buddy,\n\n1020\n00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,230\nyou know you network with other IT\npeople from the other organizations and\n\n1021\n00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:26,890\nthings like that.\n\n1022\n00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:29,930\nYou share information to help\nkeep your network safe, and\n\n1023\n00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:35,480\nso I can learn from them or from one of my\nadmins in the past or something like that.\n\n1024\n00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,836\nI can learn information from them and\nuse that to help keep my network safe and\n\n1025\n00:51:38,836 --> 00:51:42,026\nrespond to these different types of As\nlong as you have the white hat on That's\n\n1026\n00:51:42,026 --> 00:51:43,124\nright, as long as you've\ngot the white hat on.\n\n1027\n00:51:43,124 --> 00:51:47,600\n[LAUGH] What else did we not hit?\n\n1028\n00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,391\nReporting is an important\npart of this process,\n\n1029\n00:51:50,391 --> 00:51:53,640\nit's a part that sometimes\ngets left out a little bit.\n\n1030\n00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,310\nYep.\nBut, in the end typically what we do\n\n1031\n00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:00,260\nafter an incident, after we've gone\nthrough our entire procedure and\n\n1032\n00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,240\nwe've done our incidence response.\n\n1033\n00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,690\nAnd we've done our recovery and\nreconstitution procedures.\n\n1034\n00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:06,985\nThen we go back and report on this.\n\n1035\n00:52:06,985 --> 00:52:08,660\nMm-hm.\nBecause that becomes\n\n1036\n00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,600\nour information we can tie\ninto lessons learned right?\n\n1037\n00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,110\nI remember two years ago when\nwe had the same type of attack.\n\n1038\n00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:14,510\nWhat did we do there?\n\n1039\n00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:16,580\nWhat did we find that we did wrong?\n\n1040\n00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,820\nWhat could we have done better?\n\n1041\n00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:18,760\nDefinitely.\n\n1042\n00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,970\nTo help prevent or to lessen\nthe impact of that particular breach?\n\n1043\n00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:26,650\nWe wanna learn from our past.\n\n1044\n00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:30,190\nNot necessarily our mistakes, but\nlearn from the way we handled it.\n\n1045\n00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:33,080\nMaybe we did it flawlessly, and\neverything worked great, and\n\n1046\n00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,040\nthat just means I can take that plan and\n\n1047\n00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,180\nI can gold star it, and I know this is a\ngreat way to handle this type of incident.\n\n1048\n00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:43,350\nTypically, we find things that maybe we\ncould have done a little bit differently,\n\n1049\n00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:45,450\nand it would have made it\na little more efficient, or\n\n1050\n00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:49,500\nit would have exposed us to a little\nless risk or things like that.\n\n1051\n00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,130\nTrying to eliminate that if this,\nthen that would have happened.\n\n1052\n00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:55,720\nYeah, and we talk about that in so\nmany different episodes,\n\n1053\n00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:00,220\nin different objectives,\nin different just certification,\n\n1054\n00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,720\nthat thorough documentation.\n\n1055\n00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,640\nWhatever the concept is.\n\n1056\n00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,620\nAnd especially in this concept, because\nit helps with the lessons learned and\n\n1057\n00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,900\nhow we can further mitigate\nthat risk in the future.\n\n1058\n00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,800\nOr the incident in the future.\n\n1059\n00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,940\nAnd in our plans,\nit's gonna have who we're gonna report to.\n\n1060\n00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:20,040\nThere's gonna be certain people that have\nto be notified in the event of a breach.\n\n1061\n00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,330\nAnd we need to notify the right people.\n\n1062\n00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:24,100\nAnd again,\nthat needs to be laid out ahead of time.\n\n1063\n00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,920\nAm I supposed to call the CEO?\n\n1064\n00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,470\nProbably not, if I'm a help desk\nperson I probably don't call the CEO.\n\n1065\n00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:31,780\nI've got a manager that report to.\n\n1066\n00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:37,660\nAnd then he's got a chain of,\nwhat's the word I'm looking for?\n\n1067\n00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:38,700\nChain of command.\n\n1068\n00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:39,790\nChain of command, thank you.\n\n1069\n00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:42,120\nI've been retired from the army too long.\n\n1070\n00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:47,112\n[LAUGH] Then you get that chain of\ncommand that you have to follow that we\n\n1071\n00:53:47,112 --> 00:53:48,070\ngo through.\n\n1072\n00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:51,010\nAnd just make sure that again,\nin the event of a breach, or\n\n1073\n00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:53,400\nan incident, we don't think clearly.\n\n1074\n00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,820\nAnd it's so interesting how it's all just\nintertwined together because we've already\n\n1075\n00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,560\ntalked about lessons learned and\nreporting helps with lessons learned, and\n\n1076\n00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:05,760\nmaybe even a restructuring of\nthe entire departmental policies.\n\n1077\n00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,330\nRight, oh yeah.\n\n1078\n00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:10,120\nMaybe whatever we've set in place,\nwe've said yes, this is, no it's not.\n\n1079\n00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,720\n[LAUGH] No it's not.\nWe need to go back and\n\n1080\n00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,550\nrun through that again.\n\n1081\n00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:13,690\nWe need to reanalyze, yeah.\n\n1082\n00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:15,000\nExactly, exactly.\n\n1083\n00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,680\nLearning of new technologies and\nsays, well if we would've had this,\n\n1084\n00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,900\nwell now maybe we've gotta include that as\npart of the policy and say, you'd better\n\n1085\n00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,840\nimplement that because we've already\nhad to deal with it when we didn't.\n\n1086\n00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,950\nExactly.\nAll right ladies and gentlemen.\n\n1087\n00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:28,985\nTell you what, that brings us\nup to another break point, so\n\n1088\n00:54:28,985 --> 00:54:30,330\nwhy don't we stop there.\n\n1089\n00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:34,620\nWe come back, we'll continue on\nwith 2.5 and we'll go from there.\n\n1090\n00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,000\nSo we'll see you back here in a few.\n\n1091\n00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,410\n[MUSIC]\n\n1092\n00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:44,530\n[SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n1093\n00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:48,231\nWe left off towards the end\nof objective 2.5 or\n\n1094\n00:54:48,231 --> 00:54:52,620\nSY0401 our new security plus objectives.\n\n1095\n00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,880\nWe were talking about reporting.\n\n1096\n00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,540\nRight.\n\n1097\n00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:01,050\nAnd let's talk a little bit about, we kind\nof mentioned the term in that last part,\n\n1098\n00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:03,860\nrecovery and reconstitution procedures.\n\n1099\n00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:09,090\nHere what they're referring to is\njust having a plan of what to do\n\n1100\n00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,690\nafter the breach.\n\n1101\n00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:13,720\nRight, after the dust settles,\nthe smoke clears and\n\n1102\n00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:18,810\nthings like that, how are we gonna\nget our business back on track?\n\n1103\n00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:22,470\nMaking sure that we,\nwhat is it we've got to do?\n\n1104\n00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:27,170\nAnd, a lot of that's gonna depend on what\nthe breach was and how far they got,\n\n1105\n00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:29,150\nwhat was compromised and things like that.\n\n1106\n00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:32,960\nWe start, we break out our backup tapes.\n\n1107\n00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,230\nThat's what I was thinking, yeah.\n\n1108\n00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:36,160\nAnd we start doing our restores.\n\n1109\n00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,010\nTrying to think of yeah.\n\n1110\n00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:41,230\nDo we need to rebuild a server,\n\n1111\n00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:43,690\ndid it happen to be an attack that\nbrought the entire website down?\n\n1112\n00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:45,610\nDid it do any damage to\nthe data that was on that?\n\n1113\n00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:51,890\nWell I guess that would fall into\nthe backups, data that was damaged.\n\n1114\n00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:55,429\nLet's say that for instance it's a\nphysical security breach, so we might not,\n\n1115\n00:55:55,429 --> 00:55:57,875\nwe're still talking about\nintellectual resources but\n\n1116\n00:55:57,875 --> 00:55:59,450\nwe might have physical damage too.\n\n1117\n00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:00,620\nThey might have stole the hard drives.\n\n1118\n00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,330\nThere you go.\n\n1119\n00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:02,400\nOr walked out with entire server.\n\n1120\n00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,274\nSo we have to figure out again all part of\nthe scoping process is that what systems\n\n1121\n00:56:07,274 --> 00:56:11,566\nneed to be brought back online as part\nof the recovery process we need to\n\n1122\n00:56:11,566 --> 00:56:14,288\nidentify Those systems that are critical.\n\n1123\n00:56:14,288 --> 00:56:18,510\nWhich could probably lead us into the next\nobjective that we're gonna talk about.\n\n1124\n00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:23,370\nBut what are the services that we need\nto get back online now and can't wait?\n\n1125\n00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:24,390\nAnd if it does wait,\n\n1126\n00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:27,060\nunfortunately our business just is not\ngonna be able to recover from that.\n\n1127\n00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,590\nExactly, so, you can't repair\nit all at the same time, right?\n\n1128\n00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:32,460\nYou've gotta have some kind of step\nby step that we're gonna go through.\n\n1129\n00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:37,920\nSo, some type of prioritization that\nwe use get our systems back up and\n\n1130\n00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,470\nrunning, and our business back up and\nfunctioning.\n\n1131\n00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:43,560\nAnd it's usually a very frantic time, too.\n\n1132\n00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,450\nEverybody's, what do we need to do?\n\n1133\n00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:46,610\nHow fast do we need to do this?\n\n1134\n00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:47,440\nWhere do we need to go?\n\n1135\n00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,018\nWho do, I've been waiting to do this,\nwho do we need to call?\n\n1136\n00:56:50,018 --> 00:56:50,935\nYeah [LAUGH].\n\n1137\n00:56:50,935 --> 00:56:54,435\nI'm gonna lead myself into a Ghostbusters\njoke there, of course [LAUGH].\n\n1138\n00:56:54,435 --> 00:57:01,045\nAnd just being able to, for the most part,\nstay level-headed in the recovery process.\n\n1139\n00:57:01,045 --> 00:57:01,910\nMm-hm.\n\n1140\n00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:05,410\nAnother term, they're gonna throw it out\nthere, is gonna be your first responders.\n\n1141\n00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:06,920\nAnd this is just like you've seen,\n\n1142\n00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:11,440\nwhen you think of normal emergencies\noutside the computer world.\n\n1143\n00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,850\nYour first responders are the EMTs, right?\n\n1144\n00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:15,150\nThe fire department that shows up.\n\n1145\n00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:16,060\nThe law enforcement.\n\n1146\n00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:19,270\nThe law enforcement, depending on what\nthe problem is, or the situation is.\n\n1147\n00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,240\nSame thing,\nwe talk about computer breaches and\n\n1148\n00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,620\nsecurity incidents in our network.\n\n1149\n00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:24,180\nWe've got our first responders.\n\n1150\n00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,790\nYup.\nThe people that are notified right?\n\n1151\n00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:29,520\nWe talked about the notification list, the\nreporting procedures, things like that.\n\n1152\n00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,460\nYou know,\nthere's a certain procedure we follow, or\n\n1153\n00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:36,780\nthere are certain people we notify as\nsoon as we detect some type of breach.\n\n1154\n00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:40,620\nThose are my first responders, those are\nthe ones that are trained in at least some\n\n1155\n00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:45,160\nbasic forensic skills, that know\nwhat to do to lock that scene down.\n\n1156\n00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,540\nPrevent people from touching the computer.\n\n1157\n00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:50,310\nTaking screenshots and\npictures of everything.\n\n1158\n00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:55,430\nAm I doing the quarantining, or\nare we disconnecting it from the network?\n\n1159\n00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,740\nWhat are we doing?\n\n1160\n00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:00,881\nThe first responders are the ones that are\ntrained in that, that maybe helped develop\n\n1161\n00:58:00,881 --> 00:58:05,101\nthat, or if not, they've been trained in\nthose procedures that we've put in place.\n\n1162\n00:58:05,101 --> 00:58:07,185\nAnd they're gonna be the first\nones that deal with the problem.\n\n1163\n00:58:07,185 --> 00:58:10,196\nMm-hm, and\nwho has the jurisdiction to call or\n\n1164\n00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:12,760\nput this whole procedure into place.\n\n1165\n00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,370\nMm-hm.\n\n1166\n00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:15,490\nAnd at what level have we classified it?\n\n1167\n00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:19,200\nIt could be IT, first responders,\ncould be your security team.\n\n1168\n00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,160\nCould be your back up operator and\nrestoration operator.\n\n1169\n00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:28,750\nIt could be vendors that\nsupport your business.\n\n1170\n00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:33,680\nIf you have a public-facing business,\nit could be human relations.\n\n1171\n00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,360\nIt could be some kind of public,\nsomebody that's gonna be speaking public.\n\n1172\n00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,890\nIf we have stockholders,\n\n1173\n00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:44,420\nif we have investors, that all are gonna\nbe affected by this, maybe we have\n\n1174\n00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:47,860\nsomebody whose in public relations that\nhas to make public statements as well.\n\n1175\n00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:50,158\nSo they might need to be there, too.\n\n1176\n00:58:50,158 --> 00:58:55,190\nAnd say, for instance if it's a massive\nGoogle distributed denial-of-services\n\n1177\n00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:58,560\nattack that happens, and\nnot that it's happened too much lately,\n\n1178\n00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:02,070\nbut I'm sure Google's gonna have to\nhave somebody out there that says, okay,\n\n1179\n00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:04,090\nthis is how we're\nresponding to the incident.\n\n1180\n00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:05,670\nThis is what we know so far.\n\n1181\n00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:08,070\nAnd then also classification\nof that information,\n\n1182\n00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:10,490\nshould that information even\nbe given to the public.\n\n1183\n00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:14,070\nAnd a lot of times, your first responders\nare the ones that make the decision\n\n1184\n00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:18,790\non what is the severity of this breach,\nand what are the next steps.\n\n1185\n00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:22,804\nDo we need to notify those people, or\nis this something that we contain and\n\n1186\n00:59:22,804 --> 00:59:24,768\nit's not really a major incident.\n\n1187\n00:59:24,768 --> 00:59:28,891\nSo those guys are the ones\nthat come in and\n\n1188\n00:59:28,891 --> 00:59:33,393\ndo that initial examination of the breach.\n\n1189\n00:59:33,393 --> 00:59:35,100\nMm-hm.\nWhich leads us into data breach.\n\n1190\n00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:35,760\nWhich it does.\n\n1191\n00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,230\nData breach is a simple term,\n\n1192\n00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:41,290\nit just means that somebody has accessed\nour data in an unauthorized way, right?\n\n1193\n00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:43,390\nThey've exposed that data.\n\n1194\n00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:47,480\nAnd as we've said, this whole kind of,\nthese last three sub-objectives\n\n1195\n00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:50,380\nwe've been talking about,\nhave dealt with partner organizations.\n\n1196\n00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:52,390\nAnd business partners and\nthings like that.\n\n1197\n00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:58,210\nAnd so, that data breach, did it come\nfrom that other side of that partnership?\n\n1198\n00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:01,770\nWas it somebody over there\nthat has exposed this data?\n\n1199\n01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:05,180\nBut either way, we've got to try\nto figure out what was exposed.\n\n1200\n01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:09,120\nHow much of that data actually got out, or\n\n1201\n01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:12,790\nwhat were they able to get access to,\npossibly modify?\n\n1202\n01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:18,140\nAnd then, what can I do to try to\nlimit the effects of that breach.\n\n1203\n01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:22,880\nYeah, that major department store that\nwas the target of an attack, recently.\n\n1204\n01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,972\nDetermining what was that scope,\nand how many people were affected,\n\n1205\n01:00:27,972 --> 01:00:31,351\nand what data actually,\nwas it even removed?\n\n1206\n01:00:31,351 --> 01:00:32,060\nRight.\n\n1207\n01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:33,907\nAnd it doesn't have to be to removed,\n\n1208\n01:00:33,907 --> 01:00:38,450\njust viewing that information could\nbe the breach, in and of itself, too.\n\n1209\n01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:40,605\nWhich is right into our damage and\nloss control,\n\n1210\n01:00:40,605 --> 01:00:42,685\nwhich is the our last one on\nthis particular subtopic.\n\n1211\n01:00:42,685 --> 01:00:45,900\nWhich is, trying to ascertain,\nwhat was the level of damage?\n\n1212\n01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,915\nYes.\nHow far did they get?\n\n1213\n01:00:47,915 --> 01:00:49,875\nDid they get the entire customer database?\n\n1214\n01:00:49,875 --> 01:00:51,665\nDid they get all those\ncredit card numbers?\n\n1215\n01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:56,102\nAnd then trying to control that,\ntrying to make sure that we can.\n\n1216\n01:00:56,102 --> 01:01:01,016\nIf we're fortunate enough to\nbe around during the incident,\n\n1217\n01:01:01,016 --> 01:01:06,117\nwe might be able to limit that data\nloss and try to quarantine it,\n\n1218\n01:01:06,117 --> 01:01:11,518\nisolate it, or remove it from\nthe network to try to limit that loss.\n\n1219\n01:01:11,518 --> 01:01:15,478\nAll right,\nwell let's move on over to topic 2.8,\n\n1220\n01:01:15,478 --> 01:01:20,570\nwhich is gonna be summarizing\nrisk management best practices.\n\n1221\n01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:22,530\nSo, in another one of our episodes,\nI think Ronnie and\n\n1222\n01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:23,860\nNate hit this earlier this week.\n\n1223\n01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:26,960\nThey talked about risk management and\n\n1224\n01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:32,026\nthat procedure that we go through for\nfirst identifying,\n\n1225\n01:01:32,026 --> 01:01:37,470\njust summarizing, identifying the assets\nthat we have and what their values are.\n\n1226\n01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:40,190\nAnd then taking a look at, once you know\nwhat your assets are that you need to\n\n1227\n01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:43,930\nprotect, then you get a look at what\nvulnerability those assets have.\n\n1228\n01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:47,404\nWhat threats they might face, and\nthen we try to put some kind of,\n\n1229\n01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:51,766\nif we're doing a quantitative versus\na qualitative analysis, putting some type\n\n1230\n01:01:51,766 --> 01:01:55,643\nof numeric value to that,\nwhether it's quantitative or qualitative.\n\n1231\n01:01:55,643 --> 01:02:00,146\nAnd then deciding what is,\nmaking maybe a matrix, a threat matrix,\n\n1232\n01:02:00,146 --> 01:02:03,810\nor a risk matrix I should say,\nand trying to determine.\n\n1233\n01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:07,696\nWe want the high risk, the high impacts,\nthose are the ones we wanna start with,\n\n1234\n01:02:07,696 --> 01:02:10,740\nright, and work our way down to\nthe low risk, low impact ones.\n\n1235\n01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:13,710\nSo, we've talked about that.\n\n1236\n01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:16,920\nNow, we're just gonna take a look\nat some best practices that can do\n\n1237\n01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,790\nwith our risk management.\n\n1238\n01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:20,977\nAnd again, more terminology.\n\n1239\n01:02:20,977 --> 01:02:23,860\nYeah.\nYeah, just for CompTIA, love it, love it.\n\n1240\n01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:25,140\nMore terminology.\n\n1241\n01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:25,935\nYou've gotta know these.\n\n1242\n01:02:25,935 --> 01:02:28,226\nFlash cards were the way I studied,\nwith a lot of this stuff.\n\n1243\n01:02:28,226 --> 01:02:29,643\nSame here, same here.\n\n1244\n01:02:29,643 --> 01:02:31,250\nIt was a good piece of advice.\n\n1245\n01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:34,960\nYeah, when it comes to studying for\nthese exams, guys,\n\n1246\n01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,520\nwhen you've got vocab lists,\nand things like that.\n\n1247\n01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,420\nThink back to school.\n\n1248\n01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:40,520\nWhat did you do when you\nwere in fifth grade and\n\n1249\n01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,760\nyou had that spelling word list,\nthings like that?\n\n1250\n01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,840\nFlash cards and your definitions.\n\n1251\n01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,890\nSame thing here, at least for me.\n\n1252\n01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:47,570\nIt really helps.\n\n1253\n01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:48,850\nMm hm.\nI will tell you that half the time,\n\n1254\n01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:50,410\nwhen I wrote the flash cards out.\n\n1255\n01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:50,990\nYou memorized them.\n\n1256\n01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:52,220\nI never used them again.\n\n1257\n01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:52,780\nRight?\n\n1258\n01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:54,520\nI wrote them all out,\nI went and did it old school.\n\n1259\n01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,580\nThere's many electronic things you\ncan get to do flashcards with.\n\n1260\n01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,080\nI went old school index cards.\n\n1261\n01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,290\nI'd write them out.\n\n1262\n01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:02,326\nBut just the act of me writing them out,\nlooking it up,\n\n1263\n01:03:02,326 --> 01:03:05,311\nputting that definition on the back side,\nor whatever that acronym stood for.\n\n1264\n01:03:05,311 --> 01:03:06,435\nJust writing them out was helping you.\n\n1265\n01:03:06,435 --> 01:03:09,415\nWas enough to make it stick\nin this old brain of mine.\n\n1266\n01:03:09,415 --> 01:03:13,310\nWell, that goes back to like traditional\nways that we memorize stuff.\n\n1267\n01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:14,601\nThink about your spelling.\n\n1268\n01:03:14,601 --> 01:03:17,320\nYou have a spelling test,\nwhat did your teacher do?\n\n1269\n01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:21,935\n[CROSSTALK] Take ten words,\nwrite them down five times a piece.\n\n1270\n01:03:21,935 --> 01:03:24,817\nI remember way back when\nI was studying for A+,\n\n1271\n01:03:24,817 --> 01:03:29,440\nand they wanted all these processors and\nstuff to be memorized for the test.\n\n1272\n01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,405\nI literally sat down and wrote every\nsingle one of them down, and their speeds,\n\n1273\n01:03:32,405 --> 01:03:33,970\nand crumpled up the paper.\n\n1274\n01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:35,143\nIt's probably not too good for the trees.\n\n1275\n01:03:35,143 --> 01:03:38,269\nBut, crumpled up the paper and\nthrew it a way, and did the same thing.\n\n1276\n01:03:38,269 --> 01:03:40,589\nOr would get up there and would type them,\nover and over and over, and\n\n1277\n01:03:40,589 --> 01:03:41,882\nliterally just delete the document.\n\n1278\n01:03:41,882 --> 01:03:44,390\nBecause it's the same thing\nthat you're talking about.\n\n1279\n01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:45,720\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n\n1280\n01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,003\nSo, some business continuity\nconcepts that we're gonna deal with,\n\n1281\n01:03:48,003 --> 01:03:50,530\nthough that we wanna talk about here,\nbusiness impact analysis.\n\n1282\n01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:53,351\nI'm gonna give you\nthe CompTIA definition first.\n\n1283\n01:03:53,351 --> 01:03:56,726\nThey're preparation steps in\nbusiness continuity plan, or BCP.\n\n1284\n01:03:56,726 --> 01:04:00,699\nSo, business impact analysis is one\nof the steps that we go through,\n\n1285\n01:04:00,699 --> 01:04:03,930\nwhen we're generating our\nbusiness continuity plan.\n\n1286\n01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:07,990\nAnd it helps us identify present\norganizational risks, and\n\n1287\n01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:12,925\ndetermines what that impact is going\nto be on our current Functions are our\n\n1288\n01:04:12,925 --> 01:04:16,960\nongoing business critical operations and\nprocesses.\n\n1289\n01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,820\nAnd then what is the likelihood of\nthat risk actually occurring, right?\n\n1290\n01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:23,220\nDefinitely, definitely.\n\n1291\n01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,710\nSo, you're looking at things like,\n\n1292\n01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:28,700\nall right well we know that my web\nserver faces certain risks, right?\n\n1293\n01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,930\nIt's exposed to the public out there.\n\n1294\n01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:34,260\nI'm going to have people trying\nto compromise that web server.\n\n1295\n01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:39,010\nSo I know there's a vulnerability.\n\n1296\n01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:41,100\nI know what the risk is or\nI know what the threats are.\n\n1297\n01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:43,830\nWhat would it do if that server went down?\n\n1298\n01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:46,510\nWhat would happen to my business?\n\n1299\n01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:48,410\nCould we still function?\n\n1300\n01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:50,740\nIn a place like ITProTV,\n\n1301\n01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:54,681\nif our web server goes down,\nwe pretty much cease to function.\n\n1302\n01:04:54,681 --> 01:04:57,050\nThat's right.\nYou guys are all connecting through our\n\n1303\n01:04:57,050 --> 01:05:00,860\nwebsite to get to this live video feed,\nor you're going to look at our library of\n\n1304\n01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:03,480\nvideos so that you can train up for\ncertification.\n\n1305\n01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,880\nIf our website goes down,\nthat's a huge impact on our business.\n\n1306\n01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,100\nYeah, right.\nThat's one of our major\n\n1307\n01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:08,950\nbusiness functions.\n\n1308\n01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:12,750\nAnd we have to have a way to predict\nthe consequences of a disruption of\n\n1309\n01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:13,310\nthat function.\n\n1310\n01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:13,900\nLike you're saying.\n\n1311\n01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:14,990\nAbsolutely.\n\n1312\n01:05:14,990 --> 01:05:15,860\nWeb server goes down.\n\n1313\n01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:18,290\nWell sorry, our business goes down, too.\n\n1314\n01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:21,370\nBut now the sub stop down the street\nthere, I went and looked at their website\n\n1315\n01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:24,440\njust what their menu options\nwere before I went down there.\n\n1316\n01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,160\nIf their web server goes down or\nif their website is not available.\n\n1317\n01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,400\nMuch smaller impact on their business,\nright?\n\n1318\n01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,740\nBecause people are still going to go\nover there and order their food and\n\n1319\n01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:36,760\nthings like that, just because they\ncouldn't see the menu on their website, so\n\n1320\n01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,930\nthey don't rely on their website, so each,\nyou have to look at it from your company's\n\n1321\n01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:46,340\nstandpoint, what is the impact going to be\nIf this particular risk comes to fruition.\n\n1322\n01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:47,790\nIt gets taken advantage of.\n\n1323\n01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:49,430\nIt's not a one stop shop.\n\n1324\n01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:50,960\nIt's not a one size fits all.\n\n1325\n01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:56,030\nIt helps us to gather the information\nneeded to develop our recovery strategies.\n\n1326\n01:05:56,030 --> 01:05:58,110\nSo with a BIA keep that in mind.\n\n1327\n01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:00,840\nWe determine the consequences of\nan interruption of whatever that\n\n1328\n01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:01,930\nservice might be.\n\n1329\n01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:05,790\nAnd then that can help us to develop\nthose strategies that can help\n\n1330\n01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:07,960\nmitigate that impact and\n\n1331\n01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,260\ndevelop the recovery strategies that get\nus back on our feet if it does happen.\n\n1332\n01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:12,160\nExactly.\n\n1333\n01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,890\nAnd then identifying your\ncritical systems and components.\n\n1334\n01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:17,270\nWhat is it that I can't do without?\n\n1335\n01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:22,410\nIf that router goes out, my whole network\nshuts down or something like that.\n\n1336\n01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:25,260\nSo, what are the critical systems,\nwhat are the pieces,\n\n1337\n01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:29,580\nthat are gonna have the biggest impact\nif we lose those particular components?\n\n1338\n01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:31,610\nSure, and that could fall in line, and\n\n1339\n01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:33,420\nwe're gonna talk about\nthis coming up here.\n\n1340\n01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:36,010\nBut that could fall in line in\nthings like risk assessment.\n\n1341\n01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:40,410\nDetermining what are those\nmost critical infrastructure.\n\n1342\n01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:42,110\nIn this case, like you mentioned,\nthe web server.\n\n1343\n01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:44,040\nWhile that's pretty\ncritical to our system.\n\n1344\n01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:47,100\nBut if a light turns off,\nyou know, maybe in the building.\n\n1345\n01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:48,360\nThat's not so critical.\n\n1346\n01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,340\nRight.\nSo again,\n\n1347\n01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:53,400\njust identifying what needs to\nbe back on line right away.\n\n1348\n01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,780\nAnd maybe some of those things that are so\ndetrimental to the health of\n\n1349\n01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:59,700\nthe organization Our big box\nlights that we got up here, right?\n\n1350\n01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:00,650\nThey're important.\n\n1351\n01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:03,270\nThey keep the shadows from\nunder our eyes or something.\n\n1352\n01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:03,840\nSure.\nSure.\n\n1353\n01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:08,220\nIf it goes out,\nhey we can still broadcast, right?\n\n1354\n01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,000\nRight.\n[LAUGH] And\n\n1355\n01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:14,700\nthat leads right into removing\nsingle points of failure.\n\n1356\n01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:18,210\nAnother thing that we always\ntalk about in all of our\n\n1357\n01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:22,710\nepisodes that we deal with disaster\nrecovery and things like that.\n\n1358\n01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:28,460\nReally finding where you've got\nthat single point of failure.\n\n1359\n01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:30,640\nWhere I have no redundancy built in.\n\n1360\n01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,970\nRight, like your servers.\n\n1361\n01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:33,320\nWe look at servers, right.\n\n1362\n01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:36,450\nWe've implemented RAID zero,\nI'm sorry RAID 1 and\n\n1363\n01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:39,780\nwe're gonna talk about RAID\ncoming up in a bit here.\n\n1364\n01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:41,900\nBut we've implemented RAID 1 mirroring.\n\n1365\n01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:45,460\nOkay, that's fine, but what happens if\nthe RAID controller fails in the server?\n\n1366\n01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,950\nWell, I mean, that doesn't help us.\n\n1367\n01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:49,840\nSo that's why a lot of times,\nmore expensive to implement, but\n\n1368\n01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:52,070\nwe implement RAID 1 with duplexing.\n\n1369\n01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:54,960\nRight.\nYou know it just adds an extra controller\n\n1370\n01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:56,550\ncard so\nit's not a single point of failure.\n\n1371\n01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:57,400\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n\n1372\n01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,980\nIf we get that VPN connection that\ngoes back to our business partners so\n\n1373\n01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:01,760\nthat we can share that data, right?\n\n1374\n01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:02,930\nAnd we can interact.\n\n1375\n01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:05,780\nIf that goes down,\nif my ISP is unavailable.\n\n1376\n01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:08,730\nNow all of a sudden I no longer\nhave that connectivity So\n\n1377\n01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:12,100\nnow I've got two businesses that could be,\nyou know, high and dry, or waiting for\n\n1378\n01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:12,760\nthat to come back up.\n\n1379\n01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:15,050\nSo, maybe we have\nan alternate VPN solution,\n\n1380\n01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:17,410\na different ISP that we go through.\n\n1381\n01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:19,760\nWhat are the odds of\nboth of my ISPs failing?\n\n1382\n01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:22,690\nSo we're talking about again removing\nthat single point of failure.\n\n1383\n01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:26,700\nSure, they talk about that, I'm sure,\na lot in the CISCO classes and\n\n1384\n01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:27,690\nepisodes, if you will.\n\n1385\n01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:29,780\nYou know they talk about\nthings like route redundancy.\n\n1386\n01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:31,910\nI don't have any experience with that, but\n\n1387\n01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:36,220\nit makes sense that if you don't have\nconnectivity outbound, and that, or when\n\n1388\n01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:40,000\nthat connectivity fails well how do we\nstill maintain that level of connectivity?\n\n1389\n01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,935\nYou know we talk about, I always laugh\nwhen I teach some of my other classes.\n\n1390\n01:08:43,935 --> 01:08:46,915\nRemember you talk about\nhaving a bank of modems, and\n\n1391\n01:08:46,915 --> 01:08:50,235\nsetting up dial up connections and\nwhy in the heck would you do that.\n\n1392\n01:08:50,235 --> 01:08:53,775\nRight, right Because if the ISP was down,\nI'd still have connectivity And\n\n1393\n01:08:53,775 --> 01:08:58,550\nthat PSTN network it's been around for\na long time and it's well distributed.\n\n1394\n01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:02,180\nAnd we typically have a phone line of\nsorts that we still have access to.\n\n1395\n01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:04,410\nAbsolutely.\nDon Pazzet always tells the story about\n\n1396\n01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:09,920\nthat insurance company that he use to\nwork for and they had banks of modems,\n\n1397\n01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,220\nand that was because when those.\n\n1398\n01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:13,670\nHere in Florida, we have hurricanes.\n\n1399\n01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:16,210\nSure.\nAnd those insurance people have to go out\n\n1400\n01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:19,700\nto those locations and deal with it\nright after the disaster's occurred.\n\n1401\n01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:22,630\nAnd they have a certain priority\nwhen they're restoring services.\n\n1402\n01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:24,760\nWater, power, phone.\n\n1403\n01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:29,152\nCable, high speed Internet access is\nnot one of their priorities, right?\n\n1404\n01:09:29,152 --> 01:09:33,257\n[LAUGH] So if that insurance rep or\nwhatever has a modem in his laptop,\n\n1405\n01:09:33,257 --> 01:09:37,895\nhe can still connect to work even before\nthey've restored the cable connections and\n\n1406\n01:09:37,895 --> 01:09:38,954\nthings like that.\n\n1407\n01:09:38,954 --> 01:09:42,074\nAlright, so that's single\npoints of failure, and again,\n\n1408\n01:09:42,074 --> 01:09:44,960\nthat goes all the way from\nhardware to our connections.\n\n1409\n01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:49,070\nBusiness continuity planning and testing.\n\n1410\n01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:54,968\nSo when we, anytime we talk about\nthese plans, if we don't test them,\n\n1411\n01:09:54,968 --> 01:09:58,470\nthen they're questionable.\n\n1412\n01:09:58,470 --> 01:10:00,210\ni don't wanna say they're worthless.\n\n1413\n01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:03,410\nHopefully we've done a good\njob in planning them out.\n\n1414\n01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:05,360\nBut, you're not gonna find the weaknesses.\n\n1415\n01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,100\nYou're not gonna find\nthe places that you missed, or\n\n1416\n01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:12,540\nthe things that are gonna work\nunless you actually test them.\n\n1417\n01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:16,600\nSo, when it comes to our business\ncontinuity we've got all these important\n\n1418\n01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,940\npolicies and\nprocedures that we've laid out.\n\n1419\n01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:20,230\nWe've gotta test it, right?\n\n1420\n01:10:20,230 --> 01:10:22,400\nWe've gotta make sure that we're\nputting it through its test.\n\n1421\n01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,590\nAnd there's several different\nlevels of testing that we can do.\n\n1422\n01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:26,290\nThat's right.\n\n1423\n01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:28,990\nWe've mentioned some of them here,\nlike the paper testing.\n\n1424\n01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:32,720\nEverything looks good on paper and\neverything seems fine.\n\n1425\n01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:33,729\nBut you know.\n\n1426\n01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:36,022\nwhat looks good on paper, and\n\n1427\n01:10:36,022 --> 01:10:41,780\nwhat is actually a good recovery process\nmight be a little bit different.\n\n1428\n01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:45,161\nYeah, so you know a paper test just means\nwe're going to sit around at a table, and\n\n1429\n01:10:45,161 --> 01:10:48,248\nwe've got our little clipboards, and\nour check marks, and our pens, and\n\n1430\n01:10:48,248 --> 01:10:51,150\nwe're going to go through the plan,\nand we're going to check it off.\n\n1431\n01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:54,150\nAnd we're going to say make sure\nthat that business continuity plan\n\n1432\n01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:57,740\nmeets the actual business\nneeds that we've discussed.\n\n1433\n01:10:57,740 --> 01:10:58,576\nYes.\n\n1434\n01:10:58,576 --> 01:11:03,110\nAnd it's easy to do, you're sitting around\nat a table and you just got a pen and\n\n1435\n01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:04,910\npaper and you're just checking things off.\n\n1436\n01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:07,040\nSo this kind of test I can do quite often.\n\n1437\n01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,340\nI can do it a little more often.\n\n1438\n01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:11,670\nTo make sure that as my network changes,\n\n1439\n01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:16,030\nas my needs change, as those agreements\nwith those business partners change,\n\n1440\n01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:18,990\nwe can make sure that our plan\nis being kept up to date.\n\n1441\n01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:22,430\nThen you've got your walk-throughs,\nall right?\n\n1442\n01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:24,610\nYep.\nBecause, like you, like Wes said,\n\n1443\n01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:30,180\nthe paper tests are good, but\nthey might not catch certain things.\n\n1444\n01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:31,360\nAnd there's multiple components.\n\n1445\n01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:34,930\nWe talk about the, you know,\nwe talked about in the earlier\n\n1446\n01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:37,440\nsegment here where we talked about\nall these different components.\n\n1447\n01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:41,352\nThe business partner agreement,\nthe security policies and so\n\n1448\n01:11:41,352 --> 01:11:45,259\njust in a single policy,\nyou can have what, subsection Z, and\n\n1449\n01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:49,980\nall the little individual components\nwithin it, and this gives us the way to\n\n1450\n01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:54,849\nkind of just separate the components and\nthen test this portion of the policy,\n\n1451\n01:11:54,849 --> 01:11:58,832\nthey test this portion of the policy,\nif we're looking at inter\n\n1452\n01:11:58,832 --> 01:12:03,827\nservice connection agreements and\nstuff, is it, the formal documentation.\n\n1453\n01:12:03,827 --> 01:12:07,542\nLet's test it, let's see if it's gonna be\nadequate for whatever the current need is.\n\n1454\n01:12:07,542 --> 01:12:08,366\nExactly.\n\n1455\n01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:13,087\nYou look at things like Say,\nin our paper testing we've got things like\n\n1456\n01:12:13,087 --> 01:12:16,900\nthe fire suppression\nsystem has to be reset.\n\n1457\n01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:22,040\nWe've got to flip the breakers and the\nserver causing the power back on in there.\n\n1458\n01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:26,780\nBut if we don't do a walk through,\nif we don't get that power on first,\n\n1459\n01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:31,060\nI might not be able to get into the server\ncloset to get past the security system to\n\n1460\n01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:32,580\nbe able to reset the fire, you know?\n\n1461\n01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:33,160\nOr something like that.\n\n1462\n01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:33,700\nYeah, definitely.\nWell,\n\n1463\n01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:36,730\nlooking at your stamps on those\nfire suppression systems.\n\n1464\n01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:37,250\nRight.\n\n1465\n01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:37,850\nis it up to date?\n\n1466\n01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:41,010\nCould be simply walking over and saying,\nhey did we have a professional company in\n\n1467\n01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:43,480\nhere that's checked this\nsystem within the last month?\n\n1468\n01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:45,000\nIt's nothing worse than having a fire for\n\n1469\n01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,935\nsuppression system and\nwhen you need it nothing comes out.\n\n1470\n01:12:47,935 --> 01:12:52,557\n[LAUGH] And then you got\nparallel testing and that's to,\n\n1471\n01:12:52,557 --> 01:12:57,471\nif we're using it at an offsite facility,\ntesting it out,\n\n1472\n01:12:57,471 --> 01:13:02,778\ntrying to roll things over to\nthe alternate site to make sure that\n\n1473\n01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:08,690\nthat process is gonna work, but\nnot bringing down the actual site.\n\n1474\n01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:10,450\nYou know,\nnot bringing down our current site.\n\n1475\n01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:14,720\nWhat we're gonna do is kind of pretend\nthat the main site has had a failure.\n\n1476\n01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,560\nWe're gonna go through the steps and\n\n1477\n01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,180\nprocedures to bring up\nthat alternate site.\n\n1478\n01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:21,062\nAnd we're gonna make sure\nthat everything is working.\n\n1479\n01:13:21,062 --> 01:13:23,501\nBut we're not gonna take\nthe main site offline.\n\n1480\n01:13:23,501 --> 01:13:29,958\nIn a stress free type environment,\ndoes the boat really keep the water out?\n\n1481\n01:13:29,958 --> 01:13:30,720\n[LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n1482\n01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:34,000\nSo the business is still functioning as\nshould, everybody's still at the main\n\n1483\n01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,460\noffice, we're just out there\nseeing if we can bring up.\n\n1484\n01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:39,350\nHow long is it going to\ntake us to rollover,\n\n1485\n01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:41,380\nwhat is our time frame\nthat we're looking at?\n\n1486\n01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:43,750\nIs there anything that we forgot?\n\n1487\n01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:47,120\nWhen we're bring up that alternate site,\nit all looked good on paper, but\n\n1488\n01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,700\nwe get out there and\nrealize that maybe we're gonna have to\n\n1489\n01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:53,670\ncall somebody to get the AC\nsystems kicked back on, you know,\n\n1490\n01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:56,870\nthose compressors haven't been run\nin a while or something like that.\n\n1491\n01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:59,980\nSo, going through all those steps,\nagain, letting us find the kinks and\n\n1492\n01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:01,850\nweaknesses in our plant.\n\n1493\n01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:06,040\nBut parallel testing, remember the test,\nparallel testing the, parallel right?\n\n1494\n01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,440\nThe main site is still online,\n\n1495\n01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:12,130\nwe're just bringing the alternate\nsite online as well side by side.\n\n1496\n01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:14,120\nThat's the name parallel testing.\n\n1497\n01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:18,330\nYeah, moving operations from a simulated\ndisaster zone to another location.\n\n1498\n01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:21,130\nAnd we're gonna talk coming up, Peter's\nbeen kind of jumping the gun on this, but\n\n1499\n01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:22,960\nwe'll come back to it...\n\n1500\n01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,550\nWe classify other locations as a hot site,\nwarm site,\n\n1501\n01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:28,410\nand cold site, which we'll move into.\n\n1502\n01:14:28,410 --> 01:14:31,810\nBut maybe we determined\nthat other location\n\n1503\n01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:33,180\nisn't as hot as we thought it was.\n\n1504\n01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:34,010\nRight, right exactly.\n\n1505\n01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:38,520\nMaybe there's still some more\nconfiguration that we need to do, and\n\n1506\n01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:42,310\nwe're going to learn this\nbefore we have the disaster.\n\n1507\n01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:45,000\nAnd in that last test they talk about\nin our objectives is going to be\n\n1508\n01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:45,700\nthe cut over test.\n\n1509\n01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:46,990\nThis where we flip the switch.\n\n1510\n01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:47,530\nYep, yes sir.\nAnd\n\n1511\n01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:50,360\nthis is where we are actually\nbring the main site offline.\n\n1512\n01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:51,520\nKill switch engaged.\n\n1513\n01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,590\nAnd we do it.\n\n1514\n01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:56,070\nWe are full blown now, we are going\nto roll over the alternate site, and\n\n1515\n01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:57,910\nmake sure everything works.\n\n1516\n01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:02,010\nAnd as we talked about these tests,\nwe kind of, I went in a specific order.\n\n1517\n01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:05,698\nPaper tests, Performing your walkthroughs,\ndoing you're parallel, and\n\n1518\n01:15:05,698 --> 01:15:06,670\nthen your cut over.\n\n1519\n01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:10,550\nAnd the first one being\nthe easiest one to do.\n\n1520\n01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:12,250\nOne I could do more often.\n\n1521\n01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:14,690\nThe cut over being pretty darn drastic,\nright?\n\n1522\n01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:16,610\nYes.\nThat's a very involved task.\n\n1523\n01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:19,480\nThat is not something I'm gonna\ndo every Friday afternoon.\n\n1524\n01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,760\nNo because you stand to lose\nsome money in doing that.\n\n1525\n01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,030\nI mean, this is a test.\n\n1526\n01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:26,330\nLiterally for\ncontinuity of operations here and,\n\n1527\n01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:31,540\nyou do run the risk of losing some\nkind of finance because of it.\n\n1528\n01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:32,460\nAbsolutely.\n\n1529\n01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:35,660\nIt's going to be one that we're\ngoing to have a schedule.\n\n1530\n01:15:35,660 --> 01:15:37,030\nMaybe we do that annually.\n\n1531\n01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:40,300\nMaybe you do the parallel\ntesting quarterly.\n\n1532\n01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:42,240\nMaybe we do the walkthroughs monthly, and\n\n1533\n01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:46,440\nmaybe we do the paper testing on\na weekly basis something like that.\n\n1534\n01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:50,800\nYour company will decide how\noften you need to do those, but\n\n1535\n01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:51,970\nthey all need to be done.\n\n1536\n01:15:51,970 --> 01:15:54,800\nWe need to make sure, if we don't test it,\n\n1537\n01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,500\nwe're gonna find out about problems\nin our plan during the disaster.\n\n1538\n01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:01,010\nAnd it's a little too late to\ndo anything about it then.\n\n1539\n01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:04,570\nAnd when you really think of it, when you\nlook at business continuity planning, you\n\n1540\n01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:11,690\ncan just really sum it up in a business's\nresiliency to any kind of disaster.\n\n1541\n01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:15,600\nWhether it's an internal or external\ndisaster, what is our business' resiliency\n\n1542\n01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:19,980\nto keep moving forward when we\nface these different disasters?\n\n1543\n01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:22,620\nThey can be classified\ndifferent levels as well.\n\n1544\n01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:26,710\nMaybe we're testing just a single\ndisaster that really isn't, you know,\n\n1545\n01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:30,230\nthat detrimental to the company\nversus when we get to the cut over,\n\n1546\n01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,940\nnow we're really testing\nthe businesses resiliency.\n\n1547\n01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:35,250\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n\n1548\n01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:36,520\nI'm just trying to figure this out.\n\n1549\n01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:40,720\nSo a lot of these ones, we've really\ntalked about these terms here.\n\n1550\n01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:43,720\nThey bring them up again in\nthis particular objective.\n\n1551\n01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,940\nBut we've talked about risk assessment.\n\n1552\n01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:49,550\nWe know that risk assessment is going\nthrough and looking at the risk.\n\n1553\n01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:51,440\nWe've identified our assets.\n\n1554\n01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,180\nAnd now we've gotta determine\nwhat risks those assets face.\n\n1555\n01:16:55,650 --> 01:17:01,870\nContinuity of operations is making\nsure that our plan is actually\n\n1556\n01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:06,900\ngoing to allow us to at least,\nI don't wanna say limp along, but\n\n1557\n01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:13,280\ncontinue our business and be able to\nrecover, and not go under and not fail.\n\n1558\n01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:17,710\nYeah, can we continue the performance\nif some of the businesses essential and\n\n1559\n01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:19,990\ncritical function cease to exist?\n\n1560\n01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:24,700\nAnd can we do that in a completely\nbroad range of circumstances as well?\n\n1561\n01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:25,560\nExactly, exactly.\n\n1562\n01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:29,762\nAll right, well, I tell you what, we're\ncoming right up on our break time here.\n\n1563\n01:17:29,762 --> 01:17:31,515\nSo, that might be a good place to stop.\n\n1564\n01:17:31,515 --> 01:17:34,812\nWe'll go ahead and take a break,\nand when we come back,\n\n1565\n01:17:34,812 --> 01:17:39,247\nwe're gonna wrap up our topic 2.8,\nso we'll see you back here in a few.\n\n1566\n01:17:39,247 --> 01:17:45,203\n[MUSIC]\n\n1567\n01:17:46,723 --> 01:17:48,118\nHi, welcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n1568\n01:17:48,118 --> 01:17:51,668\nWe are picking it up where\nwe left off with topic, or\n\n1569\n01:17:51,668 --> 01:17:54,488\nobjective 2.8 in our SY0-401.\n\n1570\n01:17:54,488 --> 01:17:56,930\nThose new Security+ objectives.\n\n1571\n01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:59,280\nVery good on that exam code, too.\n\n1572\n01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,550\nI know, right?\n\n1573\n01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:02,744\nIf you guys just saw the first\npart of this episode.\n\n1574\n01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:07,064\nI might of called it SYS I\ndon't think I did, but.\n\n1575\n01:18:07,064 --> 01:18:08,842\n[LAUGH].\n\n1576\n01:18:08,842 --> 01:18:09,913\nCan you rewind it to make sure?\n\n1577\n01:18:09,913 --> 01:18:12,868\n[CROSSTALK]\nJust remember,\n\n1578\n01:18:12,868 --> 01:18:15,533\nyou just leave Mike a comment\non that one saying, yes you did.\n\n1579\n01:18:15,533 --> 01:18:17,217\nYeah, I know, I goofed, I goofed.\n\n1580\n01:18:17,217 --> 01:18:18,770\nAll right let's see.\n\n1581\n01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:20,880\nSo we were talking about,\n\n1582\n01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,090\nremember 2.8 was summarizing\nrisk management best practices.\n\n1583\n01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:26,700\nWe talked about some business continuity.\n\n1584\n01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:31,030\nWe talked about identifying\nour critical systems and\n\n1585\n01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:34,380\nremoving our single points of failure.\n\n1586\n01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:38,160\nWe talk about our different types\nof continuity planning and testing.\n\n1587\n01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:42,140\nWe made it all the way down to.\n\n1588\n01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:47,046\nReally we talked about risk assessment\nearlier, continuity of operations,\n\n1589\n01:18:47,046 --> 01:18:51,577\ndisaster recovery, we define that\nin a couple of our different, heck,\n\n1590\n01:18:51,577 --> 01:18:54,127\nwe talk about disaster recovery in A+.\n\n1591\n01:18:54,127 --> 01:18:57,749\nSo if you've been doing your studying,\nif your following, going to A+,\n\n1592\n01:18:57,749 --> 01:19:01,197\nNet+ Third Plus or anything like that,\nwe've talked about that, but\n\n1593\n01:19:01,197 --> 01:19:04,320\ndisaster recovery,\ndifferent from fault tolerance, right?\n\n1594\n01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:07,098\nFault tolerance is the ability to,\nand we'll go ahead and\n\n1595\n01:19:07,098 --> 01:19:08,752\nhit both of these at the same time.\n\n1596\n01:19:08,752 --> 01:19:12,109\nFault tolerance, the ability of a network\nor system to withstand a foreseeable\n\n1597\n01:19:12,109 --> 01:19:15,327\ncomponent failure and continue to\nprovide an acceptable level of service.\n\n1598\n01:19:15,327 --> 01:19:19,963\nSo we're talking about a foreseeable,\nand that's the key there,\n\n1599\n01:19:19,963 --> 01:19:22,710\nforeseeable component failure.\n\n1600\n01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:25,900\nSo we're talking about fault\ntolerances is things like raid.\n\n1601\n01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:28,340\nWe know hard drives are going to fail.\n\n1602\n01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:31,340\nThey have a mean time to failure.\n\n1603\n01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:36,900\nIf I set up a rate array, I can continue\non even if one of those hard drives fails,\n\n1604\n01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,935\ndepending on the type of array.\n\n1605\n01:19:38,935 --> 01:19:42,980\n[CROSSTALK] I might not get the same\nperformance that I get when my rate array\n\n1606\n01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:46,646\nis running at full speed, but I can\nstill continue on until I can replace\n\n1607\n01:19:46,646 --> 01:19:48,860\nthe drive and get it built back up.\n\n1608\n01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:50,530\nThat's fault tolerance.\n\n1609\n01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:54,190\nHaving redundant paths to\nmy storage area network.\n\n1610\n01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:58,090\nOne of those goes down,\nI still have another path that I can go.\n\n1611\n01:19:58,090 --> 01:20:01,050\nNow I'm pushing all that traffic\nthrough one switch, maybe,\n\n1612\n01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:03,770\nbut I'm limping along, right?\n\n1613\n01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:09,582\nDisaster recovery is when\nthe hurricane blows away the building.\n\n1614\n01:20:09,582 --> 01:20:12,786\nA flood occurs and\nwe lose the server closet.\n\n1615\n01:20:12,786 --> 01:20:17,255\nWhere we've lost,\nnow we're just struggling to survive.\n\n1616\n01:20:17,255 --> 01:20:19,638\nAnd we know it might happen, but\n\n1617\n01:20:19,638 --> 01:20:24,950\nit's not foreseeable when\nspecifically it's gonna happen.\n\n1618\n01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:27,540\nBut we'll talk about, as well,\nin other episodes about DRPs,\n\n1619\n01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:30,950\nDisaster Recovery Policies, and\nthey're really gonna outline and\n\n1620\n01:20:30,950 --> 01:20:35,470\nyou'll see that we talk about business\ncontinuity, continuity of operations,\n\n1621\n01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:38,260\nBIA, and they're all intertwined together.\n\n1622\n01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:41,710\nDisaster recovery policy is all apart\nof your business continuity plan and\n\n1623\n01:20:41,710 --> 01:20:46,520\nit just clearly defines how we will move\nsystems from one location to another\n\n1624\n01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:49,140\nafter we've already identified\nthose critical systems.\n\n1625\n01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:52,070\nIt just defines how we're gonna\ncontinue our operations and\n\n1626\n01:20:52,070 --> 01:20:55,510\nmoving our operations from\none location to the next.\n\n1627\n01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:58,040\nExactly, exactly and\nagain it's all about planning, right,\n\n1628\n01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,575\ngetting this stuff taken care\nof before the disaster occurs.\n\n1629\n01:21:00,575 --> 01:21:05,630\nMm-hm Because during the disaster is\nnot when we're making good decisions,\n\n1630\n01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:07,025\nit's too late at that point.\n\n1631\n01:21:07,025 --> 01:21:09,245\nSo we've gotta make sure we've\ngot this planned out, tested.\n\n1632\n01:21:11,175 --> 01:21:12,245\nSuccession planning.\n\n1633\n01:21:12,245 --> 01:21:14,685\nOne of the more morbid parts of it, maybe.\n\n1634\n01:21:14,685 --> 01:21:15,265\nI don't know.\n\n1635\n01:21:15,265 --> 01:21:17,655\nI call it redundancy for the bigwigs.\n\n1636\n01:21:17,655 --> 01:21:20,860\nIt's like RAID level 1 for the bigwigs.\n\n1637\n01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:25,690\nSometimes it's kind of morbid, but\nit's something you've gotta think about.\n\n1638\n01:21:25,690 --> 01:21:27,300\nI mean your staff.\n\n1639\n01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,640\nThey're a resource, right?\n\n1640\n01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:36,340\nAnd we've got to worry about what happens\nif we lose them in the case of a disaster\n\n1641\n01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:41,180\nor something like that, who steps up\nto bat if this person is unavailable?\n\n1642\n01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:42,010\nThat's right.\n\n1643\n01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:44,850\nSo that's what they mean\nby succession planning.\n\n1644\n01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:45,418\nWell look at our President.\n\n1645\n01:21:45,418 --> 01:21:46,003\nWe should know.\n\n1646\n01:21:46,003 --> 01:21:46,629\nExactly, right?\n\n1647\n01:21:46,629 --> 01:21:48,293\nWe've got a system that\ngoes down through it.\n\n1648\n01:21:48,293 --> 01:21:49,835\nYou've got a classic example.\nWe got our CEOs.\n\n1649\n01:21:49,835 --> 01:21:50,836\nWho takes over?\n\n1650\n01:21:50,836 --> 01:21:52,880\nVice President.\n\n1651\n01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:53,667\nMm-hm.\nAnd guys,\n\n1652\n01:21:53,667 --> 01:21:57,713\nI'm horrible at my politics here,\n[LAUGH] so Secretary of State below that.\n\n1653\n01:21:57,713 --> 01:22:03,205\n[CROSSTALK] So, you know,\nif our CEO [LAUGH] was no longer with us,\n\n1654\n01:22:03,205 --> 01:22:05,460\nwell, the VP takes over.\n\n1655\n01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:06,360\nWho steps in?\n\n1656\n01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:09,680\nBelow that, you know, and\nwe just have a continuous succession.\n\n1657\n01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:11,451\nAnd hopefully they're\nnot all in one plane.\n\n1658\n01:22:11,451 --> 01:22:13,021\n[LAUGH] Exactly right, exactly right.\n\n1659\n01:22:13,021 --> 01:22:15,600\nYou know, so you've got to have\na plan of who's gonna take over.\n\n1660\n01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,960\nBecause their gonna need to be trained.\n\n1661\n01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,070\nMm-hm.\nThat person's is in that\n\n1662\n01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:18,840\nposition for a reason.\n\n1663\n01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:22,830\nThey've got certain skills that they\nimplement to fill that position.\n\n1664\n01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:26,690\nThat person that's in line, you know, they\nneed to have some at least some training,\n\n1665\n01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:29,440\na basic idea of what they're going\nto do if they need to step up and\n\n1666\n01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:30,550\ntake that person's place.\n\n1667\n01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:32,240\nMm-hm.\nAnd then somebody's got to step up and\n\n1668\n01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:32,920\ntake their place, right?\n\n1669\n01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:33,460\nYeah.\n\n1670\n01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:35,750\nSo, it's going to be this whole series and\nyou've got to have that.\n\n1671\n01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:37,260\nAnd then, that gives me that,\n\n1672\n01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:40,840\nif I've got this planned out, now I\nknow I need to cross-train this person\n\n1673\n01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:44,665\nbecause they're going to step up and\ntake this position if this occurs.\n\n1674\n01:22:44,665 --> 01:22:45,470\nMm-hm.\nRight?\n\n1675\n01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:46,630\nSo, again, it's all about planning.\n\n1676\n01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:50,099\nGetting this stuff done\nbefore the situation arises.\n\n1677\n01:22:51,450 --> 01:22:52,970\nHigh availability.\n\n1678\n01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:58,170\nYou know, we've talked about that as well\nin several of our different episodes.\n\n1679\n01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:01,350\nBut making sure that.\n\n1680\n01:23:01,350 --> 01:23:04,470\nProviding that level of, you know,\nwe talked about the five nines, or\n\n1681\n01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:06,480\nthat system of nines or the six nines.\n\n1682\n01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,240\nIt's an expressed rating really.\n\n1683\n01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:12,330\nYeah, but high availability means I wanna\nmake sure that if something happens,\n\n1684\n01:23:12,330 --> 01:23:16,130\nlet's say that that server goes down,\nI still have my website up and running.\n\n1685\n01:23:16,130 --> 01:23:17,790\nSo we might do that through and\n\n1686\n01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:21,050\nagain this goes if high availability\nis type of fault tolerance, right?\n\n1687\n01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:24,460\nSo if we look down underneath fault\ntolerance we'd see things like clustering\n\n1688\n01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:27,910\nwhere we've taking multiple physical\nnodes, and it doesn't have to be physical,\n\n1689\n01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:28,550\nit can be virtual.\n\n1690\n01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:30,900\nBut we've taken multiple nodes and\n\n1691\n01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:36,130\nwe've made them look like one virtual node\nto the network, where if one of those.\n\n1692\n01:23:36,130 --> 01:23:37,740\nActually I shouldn't say that.\n\n1693\n01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:39,520\nThat's really more like load balancing.\n\n1694\n01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:43,690\nClustering is when you take multiple nodes\nand you create a cluster out of them.\n\n1695\n01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:46,270\nOne of the nodes in that cluster is\ngonna be considered the owner of\n\n1696\n01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:47,600\na particular role.\n\n1697\n01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,600\nHe's gonna be providing a service.\n\n1698\n01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,290\nIf that server fails,\n\n1699\n01:23:51,290 --> 01:23:55,510\nthen that role is gonna flip over to\nanother one of the nodes in that cluster.\n\n1700\n01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:58,940\nSo we've lost the server but\nthat particular role is still available.\n\n1701\n01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:01,530\nRight.\nThat's providing that high availability.\n\n1702\n01:24:01,530 --> 01:24:05,610\nYou know redundancy in electrical grids,\nwe've been talking in the background about\n\n1703\n01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:09,030\nsome of these major, you know,\noperations out there for example,\n\n1704\n01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:12,160\nI've been mentioning Facebook\nin the background here.\n\n1705\n01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:16,210\nYou know they've got a building I believe\nit's out in Utah that has like 13\n\n1706\n01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:20,810\nredundant diesel generators each one that\ncan provide like three megawatts of power,\n\n1707\n01:24:20,810 --> 01:24:24,000\nand so you know high availability,\nyou're talking about the five nines.\n\n1708\n01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,010\nDo you know what the downtime is for\na year in that?\n\n1709\n01:24:26,010 --> 01:24:27,530\nIt's like three or four minutes isn't it?\n\n1710\n01:24:27,530 --> 01:24:30,270\nYeah it's just under five minutes,\nit's insane and\n\n1711\n01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:33,510\nit's about the highest\nrating that you can get.\n\n1712\n01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:36,930\nI believe, and don't quote me on this one,\nif you guys know out there,\n\n1713\n01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:41,450\nyou might be able to help me out, I think\nAmazon, with their Elastic Compute,\n\n1714\n01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:42,460\nI don't think they give that.\n\n1715\n01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:44,150\nI think they give like a 99.91%.\n\n1716\n01:24:44,150 --> 01:24:48,242\nI mean, we're literally talking about\nno more than five minutes of not having\n\n1717\n01:24:48,242 --> 01:24:50,043\navailability to documentation.\n\n1718\n01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:53,020\nAnd I've seen six nines\nas far as the math goes.\n\n1719\n01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:54,680\nThat's down to the seconds I believe.\n\n1720\n01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:58,620\nI've never seen it implemented,\nI'm sure somebody out there has, maybe or\n\n1721\n01:24:58,620 --> 01:24:59,820\nhas attempted to.\n\n1722\n01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:02,030\nBut it becomes very difficult to get,\n\n1723\n01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:04,700\nthat's a lot of money that\nyou got to get out of that.\n\n1724\n01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:07,170\nYou got to really have a need for\n\n1725\n01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:11,545\nthat system not being down more\nthan three seconds a year.\n\n1726\n01:25:11,545 --> 01:25:14,330\n[LAUGH] So yeah,\nredundancy is having more than one, right?\n\n1727\n01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:17,580\nRedundant, like in our servers we\nhave redundant power supplies.\n\n1728\n01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:22,760\nIn our routers we have redundant fans and\ncooling capabilities and things like that.\n\n1729\n01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:24,610\nSo, just having more than one.\n\n1730\n01:25:24,610 --> 01:25:28,320\nWe talk about with our storage area\nnetworks we have redundant paths to get\n\n1731\n01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:32,490\nback to that so that if one of those\nrouters goes down, the rest of the servers\n\n1732\n01:25:32,490 --> 01:25:36,390\ncan still access or the servers can\nstill access that storage area network.\n\n1733\n01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:39,640\nSo redundancy just means making\nsure we have more than one\n\n1734\n01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:44,340\nto give us that fault tolerance so\nthat we can still limp along and\n\n1735\n01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:48,260\nprovide an acceptable level of service,\nmaybe not what we really want.\n\n1736\n01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:53,520\nBut until we get things back up and\nrunning we can still function.\n\n1737\n01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:54,530\nTabletop exercises.\n\n1738\n01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:58,330\nI don't know how that gets thrown down\nhere into this list of redundancy and\n\n1739\n01:25:58,330 --> 01:25:59,880\nhigh availability and stuff like that.\n\n1740\n01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:02,370\nBut you were mentioning earlier.\n\n1741\n01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:06,306\nYou know they say tabletop exercises,\nit's really just all\n\n1742\n01:26:06,306 --> 01:26:10,706\nthe participants in any kind of\nrecovery operation just getting and\n\n1743\n01:26:10,706 --> 01:26:15,029\nconstructing a discussion examining\nthe different components,\n\n1744\n01:26:15,029 --> 01:26:19,620\nresolving problems based on what\nexisting operational plans have.\n\n1745\n01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:20,380\nAnd it's really,\n\n1746\n01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:23,017\nyou kinda almost like paper test\nit It is similar to paper testing.\n\n1747\n01:26:23,017 --> 01:26:26,615\nIn a way, you know, and\nidentifying the needs of a specific plan.\n\n1748\n01:26:26,615 --> 01:26:29,445\nAnd in paper testing we're\ndeveloping the plan, but\n\n1749\n01:26:29,445 --> 01:26:32,695\nthen we have to define what are needs\nof each component of that plan and\n\n1750\n01:26:32,695 --> 01:26:35,975\nthat's where tabletop exercises\ncan kind of bring that to life.\n\n1751\n01:26:35,975 --> 01:26:37,380\nIt is very similar.\n\n1752\n01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:40,485\nSo with those paper testing we've\ngot our checklist, right and\n\n1753\n01:26:40,485 --> 01:26:43,175\nwe're going down through our plans and\nwe're just making sure logically\n\n1754\n01:26:43,175 --> 01:26:45,795\neverything seems to make sense and\nwe're not forgetting anything.\n\n1755\n01:26:45,795 --> 01:26:47,575\nTabletop exercise is very, very similar.\n\n1756\n01:26:47,575 --> 01:26:50,430\nYou're gonna see a little more\nscenario base a lot of times.\n\n1757\n01:26:50,430 --> 01:26:52,990\nRight, in a stress-free situation.\n\n1758\n01:26:52,990 --> 01:26:54,980\nAll right, what if this was to happen?\n\n1759\n01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:57,989\nLet's come up with a scenario,\nlet's say a hurricane comes through and\n\n1760\n01:26:57,989 --> 01:26:59,850\nblows away our office in Jacksonville.\n\n1761\n01:26:59,850 --> 01:27:00,590\nWhat are we gonna do?\n\n1762\n01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:05,590\nSo then everybody sits around and\nthey talk about this is what happened, and\n\n1763\n01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:07,870\nthis is what happened, and\nthis is what we would do.\n\n1764\n01:27:07,870 --> 01:27:10,260\nI always think military when\nI think tabletop exercises.\n\n1765\n01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:11,350\nDrilling and stuff like that?\n\n1766\n01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:15,280\nYeah, coming up with battle plans and\nthings like that, and exercises of,\n\n1767\n01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:18,730\nif we needed to hit this, we'd go this\nway and this way, that kind of thing.\n\n1768\n01:27:18,730 --> 01:27:22,870\nBut that's really what a tabletop\nexercise means we're gonna kinda go\n\n1769\n01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:27,293\nthrough a scenario, as Wes says,\nin a stress-free environment, right?\n\n1770\n01:27:27,293 --> 01:27:28,465\nHopefully.\n\n1771\n01:27:28,465 --> 01:27:29,570\n[LAUGH] More informal.\n\n1772\n01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:31,604\nYeah, but you're throwing out scenarios,\n\n1773\n01:27:31,604 --> 01:27:35,189\nand you're seeing how your managers\nare gonna react or how your key personnel,\n\n1774\n01:27:35,189 --> 01:27:39,169\nwhat is their decision, what do they think\nthey're gonna do next, that sort of thing.\n\n1775\n01:27:39,169 --> 01:27:46,240\nIt can actually be pretty stressful, it's\nsuppose to be a stress-free environment,\n\n1776\n01:27:46,240 --> 01:27:52,393\nbut if you're one of the new guys you\nmight not feel like you can you know.\n\n1777\n01:27:52,393 --> 01:27:53,220\nAdequately manage.\n\n1778\n01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:56,505\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nit can put a little pressure on you\n\n1779\n01:27:56,505 --> 01:28:00,835\nbecause you're making decisions on\nthe fly when a disaster occurs.\n\n1780\n01:28:00,835 --> 01:28:03,985\nBut luckily a disaster's not\noccurring we're at a table,\n\n1781\n01:28:03,985 --> 01:28:05,075\nwe're just talking about it.\n\n1782\n01:28:05,075 --> 01:28:05,646\nRight.\n\n1783\n01:28:05,646 --> 01:28:08,746\nThere was one that I don't know if we hit.\n\n1784\n01:28:08,746 --> 01:28:11,069\nI was so engrossed in the RAID 1 for\n\n1785\n01:28:11,069 --> 01:28:15,328\nthe bigwigs here that I I don't\nknow if we've got plan B there.\n\n1786\n01:28:15,328 --> 01:28:17,070\nIT contingency plan.\n\n1787\n01:28:17,070 --> 01:28:18,219\nOh no, hit it.\n\n1788\n01:28:18,219 --> 01:28:22,752\nAnd that one right there is,\nwhat happens if we learn midway through\n\n1789\n01:28:22,752 --> 01:28:27,060\na disaster that our current plan,\nit's not meeting the needs.\n\n1790\n01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:29,060\nWe need at a certain point,\nwe need plan B.\n\n1791\n01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:31,380\nPlan A's not working, now we need plan B.\n\n1792\n01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:36,230\nAnd we have to have that structured so\nthat we can, what is the cut over point.\n\n1793\n01:28:36,230 --> 01:28:40,810\nIs there a certain point within this plan\nwhere maybe a manager, a project manager,\n\n1794\n01:28:40,810 --> 01:28:44,400\nCEO, information officer says,\nyou know what?\n\n1795\n01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:47,750\nWe're halfway through this plan, and this\nplan is not meeting this disaster's needs,\n\n1796\n01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:49,700\nwe need a fallback plan.\n\n1797\n01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:51,470\nAnd in that contingency plan,\n\n1798\n01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:56,110\nyou'll probably have a determination,\na period of back out.\n\n1799\n01:28:56,110 --> 01:28:59,710\nHow far do we go within the plan A that's\nnot working before we finally say okay,\n\n1800\n01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:01,510\nwe've gotta cut over to plan B?\n\n1801\n01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:03,260\nYep, exactly right, exactly right.\n\n1802\n01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:05,170\nAll right.\n\n1803\n01:29:05,170 --> 01:29:06,540\nLet's see, fault tolerance.\n\n1804\n01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:08,800\nAgain, we really,\nwe defined fault tolerance, right?\n\n1805\n01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:12,870\nWe said that's the ability for\nus to withstand unforeseeable failure, or\n\n1806\n01:29:12,870 --> 01:29:13,850\ncomponent failure and\n\n1807\n01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:17,620\ncontinue to limp along,\nprovide an acceptable level of service.\n\n1808\n01:29:17,620 --> 01:29:20,270\nThere's several different\nthings they list there,\n\n1809\n01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:22,690\nthis should be review for you from A+.\n\n1810\n01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:26,000\nIt's part of your subscription,\nguys, so if you haven't done the A+,\n\n1811\n01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,590\ngo check out the episodes over there\nif you want a little more detail.\n\n1812\n01:29:28,590 --> 01:29:31,060\nBut, you know, providing fault\ntolerance for our hardware.\n\n1813\n01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:33,440\nYes.\nFor our routers, our switches.\n\n1814\n01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:36,010\nThat might mean having more\nthan one route available.\n\n1815\n01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:38,945\nIt also might mean having\na couple of them in the closet.\n\n1816\n01:29:38,945 --> 01:29:39,605\nRight?\n\n1817\n01:29:39,605 --> 01:29:41,605\nSo that if one of them fails\nI don't have to wait for\n\n1818\n01:29:41,605 --> 01:29:43,085\nthe vendor to give me a new one or\nanything.\n\n1819\n01:29:43,085 --> 01:29:45,785\nI've got one right here that I\ncan go swap out and plug in.\n\n1820\n01:29:45,785 --> 01:29:48,825\nSo having a fall tolerance for\nmy hardware.\n\n1821\n01:29:48,825 --> 01:29:51,085\nRAID.\nThey give us hard fall tolerance for\n\n1822\n01:29:51,085 --> 01:29:54,827\nour hard drives which is giving\nus false hopes for our data.\n\n1823\n01:29:54,827 --> 01:29:57,657\nMight be good to, even though I\ndon't really call it out here,\n\n1824\n01:29:57,657 --> 01:29:58,587\nthey talk about hardware.\n\n1825\n01:29:58,587 --> 01:30:02,567\nAnd you and I were mentioning\nthis that the term hot spare,\n\n1826\n01:30:02,567 --> 01:30:03,817\ncold spare, warm spare.\n\n1827\n01:30:03,817 --> 01:30:07,397\nWell hot spares just mean\nwhen we have this fail over.\n\n1828\n01:30:07,397 --> 01:30:09,337\nHot spare means fail over within seconds.\n\n1829\n01:30:09,337 --> 01:30:12,680\nMaybe even just completely\ntransparent to your company.\n\n1830\n01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:16,400\nA warm spare might be something\nthat's there, ready, it's online, but\n\n1831\n01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,460\nit needs a very minute\namount of configuration.\n\n1832\n01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:22,620\nSo it might take to minutes to fail\nover to this device if you will.\n\n1833\n01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:25,380\nAnd then cold spare could be just\na server that doesn't even have\n\n1834\n01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:26,330\nan operating system on it.\n\n1835\n01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:27,650\nRight.\nStill needs to be configured,\n\n1836\n01:30:27,650 --> 01:30:29,420\nstill have to have to add the roles to it,\nthings like that.\n\n1837\n01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:33,430\nYeah, and when you think of it\nfrom a monetary perspective.\n\n1838\n01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:36,165\nYou know, hot spares are the most\nexpensive to maintain,\n\n1839\n01:30:36,165 --> 01:30:40,926\ncuz it's a full replica of\nthe current hardware we have.\n\n1840\n01:30:40,926 --> 01:30:45,160\nWarm spares not so expensive to maintain,\n\n1841\n01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:48,120\nbut definitely is gonna take a little\nbit longer to bring these online.\n\n1842\n01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:51,270\nCold spares, very, very cheap to maintain.\n\n1843\n01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:54,130\nThe problem is it could cost us\na lot of money if we have to rely on\n\n1844\n01:30:54,130 --> 01:30:55,940\nthem in a disaster situation.\n\n1845\n01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:57,430\nExactly.\n\n1846\n01:30:57,430 --> 01:31:00,010\nWe talked about clustering,\nload balancing.\n\n1847\n01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:02,700\nI think I heard Ronnie and Nate talking\nabout that in this morning's episode.\n\n1848\n01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:03,480\nYeah, definitely.\n\n1849\n01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:07,340\nBut load balancing, we typically see this\non web servers, and things like that.\n\n1850\n01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:09,380\nBut if we need that level\nof fault tolerance,\n\n1851\n01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:12,360\nwhere if one of those servers goes down.\n\n1852\n01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:14,180\nEverybody can still get to my website,\nand buy a product.\n\n1853\n01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:15,460\nSo we do load balancing.\n\n1854\n01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:19,070\nWhere we've got ten web servers that\nall have the exact same content, and\n\n1855\n01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:21,040\nevery time a request comes in,\n\n1856\n01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,770\nit gets redirected to another\none of those servers, or\n\n1857\n01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:28,130\nit changes up which server it's directing\nto, to balance the workload across them.\n\n1858\n01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:31,020\nIf one of those nodes goes down,\nthat load balancer can detect that and\n\n1859\n01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:33,790\nsend that request to the other nine\nnodes that are still available.\n\n1860\n01:31:33,790 --> 01:31:37,040\nSo we're getting a level of fault\ntolerance by doing that load balancing.\n\n1861\n01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,940\nYou've mentioned in some of\nthe other server episodes that we've\n\n1862\n01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:42,480\ntalked about your forte DNS.\n\n1863\n01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:43,490\nRight, absolutely.\n\n1864\n01:31:43,490 --> 01:31:46,720\nWe just very, and\nyou can check those episodes out.\n\n1865\n01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:49,980\nBut we have multiple DNS servers\nbecause we need name resolution.\n\n1866\n01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:53,450\nAnd that can cause information access\nproblems, resource access problems.\n\n1867\n01:31:53,450 --> 01:31:54,840\nEven within our own internal network.\n\n1868\n01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:57,680\nWe don't even worry about external\nnetworks because we a lot of times we use\n\n1869\n01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:58,850\nour ISP servers.\n\n1870\n01:31:58,850 --> 01:32:03,070\nBut there's a reason we have\nmultiples of DNS servers so\n\n1871\n01:32:03,070 --> 01:32:06,790\nthat if one goes down, we still have name\nresolution within the internal network.\n\n1872\n01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:07,770\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n\n1873\n01:32:07,770 --> 01:32:10,100\nAnd we talked about it\nwith active directory.\n\n1874\n01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:12,880\nYou know, making sure you're not gonna\nrun just one domain controller because if\n\n1875\n01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,250\nit goes down now,\nnobody can authenticate, so.\n\n1876\n01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:14,890\nThat's right.\n\n1877\n01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:16,980\nWe've given that fault\ntolerance at the server level.\n\n1878\n01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:17,480\nYep.\n\n1879\n01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:19,550\nLet's see what else.\n\n1880\n01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:20,470\nSo, backup plan, so\n\n1881\n01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:24,170\nwe're getting down to that last part down\nthere is our disaster recovery concepts.\n\n1882\n01:32:24,170 --> 01:32:26,250\nAnd we're talking about backup plans.\n\n1883\n01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:27,680\nAnd back up policies.\n\n1884\n01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:32,260\nThis is going to mean deciding\nwhat is it I need to back up.\n\n1885\n01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:35,110\nI might not need to back up everything.\n\n1886\n01:32:36,310 --> 01:32:38,600\nAnd back ups take space.\n\n1887\n01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,080\nBack ups take time.\n\n1888\n01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:45,470\nSo I need to try to figure out what it\nactually it is that I need to back up.\n\n1889\n01:32:45,470 --> 01:32:48,120\nAnd I need a policy for that.\n\n1890\n01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:50,690\nTo make sure everybody's aware\nof what needs to be backed up.\n\n1891\n01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:55,320\nAnd we talk about backup types in other\nepisodes where we go pretty much in depth\n\n1892\n01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,840\nof what back up types, but\nyou gotta understand, too.\n\n1893\n01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:00,940\nA company might have very little downtime,\n\n1894\n01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:04,300\nlet's say between one shift ending and\none shift starting.\n\n1895\n01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:06,360\nOr maybe it's e-commerce so it's 24/7.\n\n1896\n01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:09,140\nSo you know what backup you implement\n\n1897\n01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:11,940\nyou might have a lot of time to\ngather that crucial information.\n\n1898\n01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:15,080\nBut, at the same time, you might be\na company that loses millions of dollars\n\n1899\n01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:17,360\nan hour when you don't\nhave access to that data.\n\n1900\n01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:19,790\nSo maybe you need a faster\nrecovery process,\n\n1901\n01:33:19,790 --> 01:33:21,690\nyour backup time maybe is not so critical.\n\n1902\n01:33:21,690 --> 01:33:25,220\nSo that's all part of that policy\ndetermining, what is more critical?\n\n1903\n01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:29,200\nGetting that data off of that machine,\nor restoring that data?\n\n1904\n01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:34,030\nAnd that's gonna be, really gonna be on\nwhat type of backup you even implement.\n\n1905\n01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:34,670\nAbsolutely.\n\n1906\n01:33:34,670 --> 01:33:37,590\nWhich could probably lead into\nbackup execution frequency.\n\n1907\n01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:38,700\nThat's exactly right.\n\n1908\n01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:40,260\nAre we doing a full back up?\n\n1909\n01:33:40,260 --> 01:33:41,670\nAre we doing a differential backup?\n\n1910\n01:33:41,670 --> 01:33:42,960\nAre we doing incremental backup?\n\n1911\n01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:47,740\nAnd typically it's some combination\nof those to facilitate that need.\n\n1912\n01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:49,850\nThat recovery time objective\nthat we want to set.\n\n1913\n01:33:49,850 --> 01:33:53,120\nThat we'll talk all about when we get,\nI don't know if those guys hit it yet, but\n\n1914\n01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:56,530\nwe'll come to talk about some of those\nterms like recovery point objective.\n\n1915\n01:33:56,530 --> 01:33:57,350\nYeah, definitely.\n\n1916\n01:33:57,350 --> 01:34:01,100\nRecovery time objective, but yeah,\nthe backup execution is two step.\n\n1917\n01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:03,440\nHow are we doing those backups?\n\n1918\n01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:06,270\nIs it an automated,\nthere should be an automated process.\n\n1919\n01:34:06,270 --> 01:34:07,580\nDoes it take four hours?\n\n1920\n01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:09,860\nDo we have four hours to wait?\n\n1921\n01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:11,130\nYou know, to get that data.\n\n1922\n01:34:11,130 --> 01:34:14,370\nVersus, do we have four hours\nto wait to restore that data?\n\n1923\n01:34:14,370 --> 01:34:17,550\nYou're talking, you could be potentially\ntalking about terabytes of data.\n\n1924\n01:34:17,550 --> 01:34:20,940\nWhen's the last time you run\na check disk on a terabyte drive?\n\n1925\n01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:21,680\nAt 18 hours?\n\n1926\n01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:25,860\nYeah, so that could change the frequency,\nhow often we're backing up.\n\n1927\n01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:29,300\nIf I'm backing up, if I'm doing\nincremental backups, and I'm backing up\n\n1928\n01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:32,170\nmore often, that means there's\nfewer changes that are occurring so\n\n1929\n01:34:32,170 --> 01:34:34,240\nthose back ups are going to be smaller,\nquicker.\n\n1930\n01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,360\nIt also means a lot more\nrestoration process.\n\n1931\n01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:39,010\nYou're going to come here with six\nboxes of tapes to restore your\n\n1932\n01:34:39,010 --> 01:34:39,843\ninformation [LAUGH].\n\n1933\n01:34:39,843 --> 01:34:44,053\nPretty much, when I got to restore every\none of those incremental backups in order\n\n1934\n01:34:44,053 --> 01:34:46,490\nto complete my restore process.\n\n1935\n01:34:46,490 --> 01:34:47,130\nYeah.\nSo, yeah.\n\n1936\n01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:51,230\nJust having a good idea of what my options\nare and then coming up with a plan.\n\n1937\n01:34:51,230 --> 01:34:52,750\nAnd making sure we test it, right?\n\n1938\n01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:54,240\nThey don't call it out directly in here,\n\n1939\n01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:56,980\nbut those plans have to be\ntested like any other plans.\n\n1940\n01:34:56,980 --> 01:34:58,810\nSure, and with the policies,\ntoo, a lot of times, and\n\n1941\n01:34:58,810 --> 01:35:04,590\nwe've definitely hit this in other topics,\nand will within these,\n\n1942\n01:35:04,590 --> 01:35:08,300\nthe security plus, and the new\nobjectives is that separation of duties.\n\n1943\n01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:11,890\nWe don't want that person that has\naccess to our data potentially being,\n\n1944\n01:35:11,890 --> 01:35:15,650\nor access to pulling that\ndata off the machine,\n\n1945\n01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:17,860\nto maybe be the person that\ncan restore that data.\n\n1946\n01:35:17,860 --> 01:35:19,100\nMaybe that's too much of a power.\n\n1947\n01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:20,600\nSo we implement separation of duties.\n\n1948\n01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:22,250\nAnd we gotta figure which,\n\n1949\n01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:26,140\nwho is it that we're gonna call\nwhen we need those backups.\n\n1950\n01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:26,800\nWhere are they stored?\n\n1951\n01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:30,450\nAre they stored, are the frequent backups\nstored on site, are they off site, and\n\n1952\n01:35:30,450 --> 01:35:32,300\nif they're off site who\nis it that has them?\n\n1953\n01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:35,345\n[LAUGH] You know, it could be in\nan employee's car, locked in the trunk.\n\n1954\n01:35:35,345 --> 01:35:36,730\n[LAUGH] Heard that one.\n\n1955\n01:35:36,730 --> 01:35:38,910\nI was like, wait what?\n\n1956\n01:35:38,910 --> 01:35:40,150\nSay it isn't so.\n\n1957\n01:35:40,150 --> 01:35:41,820\nBut she lived the furthest\nfrom the office, so\n\n1958\n01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:44,150\nthey figured her trunk would\nbe their off site storage.\n\n1959\n01:35:44,150 --> 01:35:48,050\nPlease tell me they didn't put a tape in\nFlorida, during the middle of the summer.\n\n1960\n01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:49,826\nYou know, I was like,\nwe should really talk.\n\n1961\n01:35:49,826 --> 01:35:51,180\n[LAUGH] It worked for them, I guess.\n\n1962\n01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:54,180\nI was gonna say, some people out there\nprobably don't even know what cassette\n\n1963\n01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:55,740\ntapes or eight tracks or\nanything like that.\n\n1964\n01:35:55,740 --> 01:35:57,690\nYou remember leaving that\non your dash in the summer?\n\n1965\n01:35:57,690 --> 01:35:58,430\nOh yeah.\nYou'd come out and\n\n1966\n01:35:58,430 --> 01:35:59,280\nyou'd have a warped mess.\n\n1967\n01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:00,560\nIt looked like a Salvador Dali painting.\n\n1968\n01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:02,795\nI would say that was\nprobably an untested plan.\n\n1969\n01:36:02,795 --> 01:36:05,411\n[LAUGH] They really needed to test that.\n\n1970\n01:36:05,411 --> 01:36:07,843\nAll right, and then that brings\nus to our last little topic,\n\n1971\n01:36:07,843 --> 01:36:11,100\nwhich we kinda talked a little bit about,\nbut let's go a little further into it.\n\n1972\n01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:15,337\nWe've got cold sites,\nwarm sites, and hot sites.\n\n1973\n01:36:15,337 --> 01:36:19,540\nAnd cold site is really just an idea,\nright?\n\n1974\n01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:20,560\nYep.\nA location.\n\n1975\n01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:23,890\nIt's, all right, if this site fails.\n\n1976\n01:36:23,890 --> 01:36:28,350\nYou know, if the office here gets flooded,\ngets blown away by a hurricane,\n\n1977\n01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:33,920\nsome major disaster occurs, this is where\nwe're going to move everything to, right?\n\n1978\n01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,330\nWhat they called prospect building.\n\n1979\n01:36:36,330 --> 01:36:38,220\nYou're going down the interstate and\nyou're like, wow,\n\n1980\n01:36:38,220 --> 01:36:40,080\nthat building looks like it'd be good.\n\n1981\n01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:44,100\nWe might have a plan in place.\n\n1982\n01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:46,520\nWe might have talked to the people\nthat own it and say, hey or something.\n\n1983\n01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:51,000\nWe might even have a lease on a building,\nI suppose, but there's nothing in it.\n\n1984\n01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,100\nIt's just an empty building.\n\n1985\n01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:55,030\nOr like you said, it might be just\nan idea, like that building looks\n\n1986\n01:36:55,030 --> 01:36:58,140\nreally good, but I think I'd wanna\nfirm it up just a little bit.\n\n1987\n01:36:58,140 --> 01:36:59,730\nYeah.\nCuz somebody else might be driving by\n\n1988\n01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:02,190\ngoing on that building\nlooks like a good place.\n\n1989\n01:37:02,190 --> 01:37:04,600\nThat looks like a good plot, yeah.\n\n1990\n01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:07,950\nSo it could be, you know, most likely\nit's in a completely different area.\n\n1991\n01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:08,750\nYep.\n\n1992\n01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:11,780\nYou know like if it's a hurricane,\neverything in the area is gone, so\n\n1993\n01:37:11,780 --> 01:37:15,630\nwe might be going up to\nthe Appalachian Mountains somewhere.\n\n1994\n01:37:15,630 --> 01:37:16,740\nLittle higher ground.\n\n1995\n01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:19,390\nCold sites, again, you look.\n\n1996\n01:37:19,390 --> 01:37:20,340\nEasiest to maintain.\n\n1997\n01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:21,470\nCheapest to maintain.\n\n1998\n01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:25,200\nMost expensive to implement\nwhen you need them.\n\n1999\n01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:26,570\nAbsolutely, and\n\n2000\n01:37:26,570 --> 01:37:30,790\nthen you've got the warm site, which\nis just a step up from that cold site.\n\n2001\n01:37:30,790 --> 01:37:34,630\nNow we're talking about a place\nthat might be dormant, right?\n\n2002\n01:37:34,630 --> 01:37:37,070\nBut it has the equipment there and\nin fact,\n\n2003\n01:37:37,070 --> 01:37:41,150\nit might actually be doing some non\ncritical functions for our enterprise.\n\n2004\n01:37:41,150 --> 01:37:42,720\nAnd maybe that's where\nour backups are going.\n\n2005\n01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,520\nWhen we say we store them on site,\noffsite.\n\n2006\n01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:46,230\nRight.\nMaybe that's where our backups are going.\n\n2007\n01:37:46,230 --> 01:37:49,260\nBut really maybe just limited\nto that functionality alone.\n\n2008\n01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:51,562\nThen, now we have a location to go and\nrather than looking for\n\n2009\n01:37:51,562 --> 01:37:52,702\nthe trunk of someone's car.\n\n2010\n01:37:52,702 --> 01:37:53,214\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah.\n\n2011\n01:37:53,214 --> 01:37:56,040\nIt might be giving us a- [LAUGH]\nRedundancy for some of our services and\n\n2012\n01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,380\nthings like that.\n\n2013\n01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:59,470\nBut it's still going to take you and\nwe're going to have to go out there,\n\n2014\n01:37:59,470 --> 01:38:00,470\nturn everything on.\n\n2015\n01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:03,740\nWe might have been restoring backups\nout there so that we're close.\n\n2016\n01:38:03,740 --> 01:38:06,370\nAnd all we need to do is the last\nset of backups that were made,\n\n2017\n01:38:06,370 --> 01:38:09,760\nbefore that disaster occurred,\njust have to be restored out there.\n\n2018\n01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:14,620\nSo we can be up and running relatively\nquickly, but a lot of times warm sites,\n\n2019\n01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:17,640\nmaybe the power is not actually on or\nthe phone service isn't actually on.\n\n2020\n01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:19,150\nIt's all hooked up, it's there,\n\n2021\n01:38:19,150 --> 01:38:22,370\nbut we gotta get some of that stuff\nturned on and flip some switches.\n\n2022\n01:38:22,370 --> 01:38:24,060\nAnd that's the medium range too, right?\n\n2023\n01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:26,820\nYou know when we say\nmedium between what is\n\n2024\n01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:29,660\nthe expense of the upkeep of\nthis current site when we're not\n\n2025\n01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:31,950\nusing it versus what is\nthe expense when we need it.\n\n2026\n01:38:31,950 --> 01:38:33,160\nExactly, exactly.\n\n2027\n01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:36,700\nYeah, I like most of the warm sites\nthat I've dealt with have been dormant.\n\n2028\n01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:37,920\nThey don't really do anything so\n\n2029\n01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,900\nyou're talking about you know\ndust covers over everything.\n\n2030\n01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:45,450\nYou can imagine this place like\nbeing dark and just all covered up.\n\n2031\n01:38:45,450 --> 01:38:48,810\nAnd then when disaster occurs\nyou have to go out there and\n\n2032\n01:38:48,810 --> 01:38:50,670\nflip on the electricity and go in there.\n\n2033\n01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:53,340\nPull all the blankets off the table and\nall that kind of stuff and\n\n2034\n01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:55,740\nget everything booted up and\nget everything started up.\n\n2035\n01:38:55,740 --> 01:39:00,280\nThen you got your hot site,\nwhich is the fully configured\n\n2036\n01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:04,160\nalternate site that really\nis almost ready to go.\n\n2037\n01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:05,850\nYes, that's where you're parallel testing.\n\n2038\n01:39:05,850 --> 01:39:08,600\nYou figure out if it\ntruly is a hot site but\n\n2039\n01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:12,220\nfully functional,\nfully operational, ready to go.\n\n2040\n01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:15,330\nIn fact, if you were to do that kill\nswitch engage, you're ready to go.\n\n2041\n01:39:15,330 --> 01:39:17,208\nYeah, we've just gotta transfer\nthe employees over there.\n\n2042\n01:39:17,208 --> 01:39:19,570\nTypically the backups are all\nbeing restored over there,\n\n2043\n01:39:19,570 --> 01:39:20,900\nup to the very last one.\n\n2044\n01:39:20,900 --> 01:39:24,190\nAnd you could have a subset of employees\nthat are, I almost said stationed with\n\n2045\n01:39:24,190 --> 01:39:28,220\nthe military, that are there already,\nso just in case we need that, we've\n\n2046\n01:39:28,220 --> 01:39:32,750\nalready got a handful of the team members\nthat are there ready to help us out.\n\n2047\n01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:33,820\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n\n2048\n01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:36,360\nSo as you said obviously\nthe most expensive to maintain,\n\n2049\n01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:38,390\ncuz you know we've got a fully\nfunctioning site sitting out there.\n\n2050\n01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:39,190\nIt's a parallel site.\n\n2051\n01:39:39,190 --> 01:39:39,700\nThat's right.\n\n2052\n01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:41,750\nSo hopefully we're kind of using it for\nsomething,\n\n2053\n01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:43,300\ngetting some benefit out of it at least.\n\n2054\n01:39:44,630 --> 01:39:47,750\nAll right well,\nI think that pretty much covers,\n\n2055\n01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:49,060\nhave we missed anything in 2.8 there?\n\n2056\n01:39:49,060 --> 01:39:51,080\nLet's look back and just see here.\n\n2057\n01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:52,800\nDo a quick review.\n\n2058\n01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:53,910\nAny last minute questions?\n\n2059\n01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:55,920\nYou guys have been awfully quiet\nout there in the chat room.\n\n2060\n01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,930\nAny questions you guys wanna launch\nat us before we wrap this baby up?\n\n2061\n01:39:59,930 --> 01:40:01,410\nLot of jargon.\n\n2062\n01:40:01,410 --> 01:40:03,090\nLot of [CROSSTALK] of terminology Yeah.\n\n2063\n01:40:03,090 --> 01:40:03,910\nTerminology.\n\n2064\n01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:07,730\nGet out the flash cards,\ntraditional memory techniques if you can.\n\n2065\n01:40:07,730 --> 01:40:10,910\nIf you have to write them down over and\nover and over, write them down.\n\n2066\n01:40:10,910 --> 01:40:11,440\nIt's not fun.\nYeah.\n\n2067\n01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:14,455\nI was going to say it's\nlike doing sIt ups.\n\n2068\n01:40:14,455 --> 01:40:20,852\n[LAUGH] But anybody can look at me and see\nhow much I like doing sit ups, you know.\n\n2069\n01:40:20,852 --> 01:40:21,599\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH] All right.\n\n2070\n01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:23,360\nWell, if you're good, I'm good I think.\n\n2071\n01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:26,050\nThat's right Paul, and\ngood to see you Paul out there.\n\n2072\n01:40:26,050 --> 01:40:28,620\nGreat to see you again today bud,\ngreat to have you here every day.\n\n2073\n01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:31,840\nIt really is you know, and CommT is\nheavy on terms in all the classes.\n\n2074\n01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:34,350\nYou guys have probably gone through\nA plus, Net plus, and you know a big\n\n2075\n01:40:34,350 --> 01:40:38,800\npart of CommT exams are knowing the\nacronyms, knowing what they stand for, and\n\n2076\n01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:42,570\nunderstanding your terminology,\nunderstanding CommT terminology.\n\n2077\n01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:44,880\nMaking sure that we know what they mean.\n\n2078\n01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:48,310\nAnd then, I don't know, some of the plans\nand stuff, they start to run together,\n\n2079\n01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:51,020\nthe business continuity plan,\nthe disaster recovery plan.\n\n2080\n01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:53,159\nAnd again,\nsome of them have very similar names.\n\n2081\n01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:57,880\nWell it's kind of like Ronnie says,\nit's identification of the concepts.\n\n2082\n01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:01,640\nBeing able to classify and\nidentify the terms and the concepts and\n\n2083\n01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:02,790\nknowing what they are.\n\n2084\n01:41:02,790 --> 01:41:04,710\nExactly, exactly.\n\n2085\n01:41:04,710 --> 01:41:10,863\nAll right, well then I think that's going\nto wrap it up for us today for our topic.\n\n2086\n01:41:10,863 --> 01:41:13,715\nWe've hit objective 2.2, 2.5, and 2.8.\n\n2087\n01:41:13,715 --> 01:41:15,465\n[CROSSTALK] In what exam?\n\n2088\n01:41:15,465 --> 01:41:21,490\nIn the X, Y, zero.\nAll right, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n2089\n01:41:21,490 --> 01:41:22,240\nWe appreciate it.\n\n2090\n01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:24,690\nGlad you all joined us today,

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:36,311 --> 00:00:40,080\nI am your host, Mike Rodrick, and with me\ntoday is my good friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n5\n00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,721\nHow you doing Wes?\n\n6\n00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:41,231\n>> I'm doing okay.\n\n7\n00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:42,680\nThanks, Mike.\nThanks for having me back.\n\n8\n00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,780\n>> Alright.\nGood to have you here.\n\n9\n00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,980\nGood to have you here.\n\n10\n00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,310\nWe are getting ready to dive\ninto some more Security Plus.\n\n11\n00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,770\nWe are still working on our,\nthe new objectives, right?\n\n12\n00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,145\nThe SY0401, for those of you that are.\n\n13\n00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:58,345\nAre getting ready to take that exam, and\nyou might be studying for the 301 in which\n\n14\n00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:00,875\nis a, it will be expired at the end\nof the year, if I remember right.\n\n15\n00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:01,405\n>> Yeah, I believe so.\n\n16\n00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:02,685\nSo, you still got some time.\n\n17\n00:01:02,685 --> 00:01:03,185\n>> In December, Yeah.\n\n18\n00:01:03,185 --> 00:01:03,755\n>> Still got some time.\n\n19\n00:01:03,755 --> 00:01:04,285\n>> Exactly.\n\n20\n00:01:04,285 --> 00:01:06,915\nIf you're, anyway, and we've talked\nabout that in the very first episode.\n\n21\n00:01:06,915 --> 00:01:09,080\nSo, I won't rehash all that fun stuff.\n\n22\n00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,350\nWe will just dive right into it.\n\n23\n00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,700\nWe've got some fun stuff that\nwe're gonna talk about today.\n\n24\n00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,400\nActually in my opinion it's a little\nbit of the lighter side of it.\n\n25\n00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,720\nNot as difficult as what we did\nyesterday with those dern policies and\n\n26\n00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,270\nstuff like that.\n\n27\n00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,580\n>> Yes, poor people out there with all the\nacronyms and the policies and procedures,\n\n28\n00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,665\nand the-\n>> Exactly.\n\n29\n00:01:25,665 --> 00:01:29,380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It can be a little dry sometimes.\n\n30\n00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,590\nSo, good to have everybody here.\n\n31\n00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,160\nHope you guys are ready to rock and roll.\n\n32\n00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,190\nAnd we will jump right into it.\n\n33\n00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,635\nWe're gonna be doing topic or\n\n34\n00:01:34,635 --> 00:01:40,260\nobjective 2.6 today as well as\nobjective 2.7 a little later on.\n\n35\n00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,600\nBut 2.6 is gonna be explain\nthe importance of security\n\n36\n00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,590\nrelated awareness and training.\n\n37\n00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,110\nAll right?\n>> You made a good point yesterday.\n\n38\n00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,100\nYou're like,\neverything has to start with awareness.\n\n39\n00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,760\n>> It really does.\n\n40\n00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,870\n>> Why don't I click on that\nlittle glitter graphic?\n\n41\n00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,910\nWhy don't I open that email attachment?\n\n42\n00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,610\nWhy don't I share a key fob?\n\n43\n00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,170\nWhy don't write passwords down?\n\n44\n00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:58,670\n>> Exactly right.\n\n45\n00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,820\n>> Yep.\nDefinitely.\n\n46\n00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,040\n>> You know when we talk about security.\n\n47\n00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,950\nA couple of things I always like to point\nout, when we're talking about security,\n\n48\n00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,100\none is that everybody is\npart of your security team.\n\n49\n00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,600\nRight?\n\n50\n00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,430\nI mean that means from the, and\nwe talked about this, I know Ronnie and\n\n51\n00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,375\nI did an episode earlier this week\nwhere we talked about layers.\n\n52\n00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,445\nOf defense.\n\n53\n00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:18,385\nBut, everybody's apart of security,\nbecause, normally,\n\n54\n00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:19,975\nwhere do the breeches occur?\n\n55\n00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:21,865\nThey occur at the end user level.\n\n56\n00:02:21,865 --> 00:02:22,535\n>> Right.\n\n57\n00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:25,635\n>> Out of the good majority of them,\nare somebody clicking on a link and\n\n58\n00:02:25,635 --> 00:02:27,110\nintroducing malware.\n\n59\n00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,740\nLeaving a door propped open,\nleaving a laptop laying around somewhere,\n\n60\n00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,580\nleaving themselves logged in,\nlosing a thumb drive.\n\n61\n00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,750\nI mean, most of our breaches\noccur at that end user level.\n\n62\n00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,460\n>> Nothing like having a hundred\nthousand dollar security system,\n\n63\n00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,650\nretina scanners and\nthen somebody propping the door open.\n\n64\n00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,370\n>> Right, exactly so it's everybody.\n\n65\n00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,890\nFrom the CEO all the way down to\nthe lowest person in that totem pole.\n\n66\n00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,130\nWe've all got to be apart of security.\n\n67\n00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,940\nAnd, that means,\nthey have to be aware of that.\n\n68\n00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,630\nWe have to teach them that\nthey are the layering.\n\n69\n00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,240\n>> That's right.\n\n70\n00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,230\nYes, sir, Paul.\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n71\n00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,990\nWe have to make sure that they understand\nthat they're part of security and\n\n72\n00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,940\nthat it's everybody's responsibility.\n\n73\n00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,790\nAnd so that means we have to trade them.\n\n74\n00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,450\nWe have to make them aware.\n\n75\n00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,800\nWe can have all those policies.\n\n76\n00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,080\nIf they don't know the policies are there,\nwhat the policies define.\n\n77\n00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,510\nThen it doesn't do them a lot of good.\n\n78\n00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,750\nIt doesn't do us a lot of good.\n\n79\n00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,600\nIt's a constant thing.\n\n80\n00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,840\nIt's not just a one time thing.\n\n81\n00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,090\nWe know our users.\n\n82\n00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,125\nRight? They're not computer people.\n>> Oh Yeah.\n\n83\n00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:23,660\nPaul knows our users too.\n\n84\n00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,620\n>> So we've got to constantly\nremind them about security.\n\n85\n00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,700\nI've worked with several different\ncompanies where they try to make it\n\n86\n00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,580\nfun, right?\n\n87\n00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,620\nHave a lunch and learn.\n\n88\n00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,920\nHave a pizza party and\ntalk about passwords and\n\n89\n00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,920\nhow to come up with good strong passwords.\n\n90\n00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,280\nPosters hanging around on the wall\nthat are constant reminders of\n\n91\n00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,870\nmake sure nobody follows you in the door,\nyou know, always ask you know if you see\n\n92\n00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,670\nsomebody walking around ask them who\nthey are and if you can help them.\n\n93\n00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,710\nYou know, so if you see somebody you\ndon't know or doesn't have a badge.\n\n94\n00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:54,390\nSo it really does come down to making\nsure that my users are aware of that and\n\n95\n00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,090\nthat means good security.\n\n96\n00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:56,630\nTraining.\n\n97\n00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,150\n>> Yep, definitely.\n\n98\n00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,440\n>> And we can say we've got\nour general training, or\n\n99\n00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,320\ngeneral security training,\nthat we teach everybody,\n\n100\n00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,345\nlike password policies and\nsecuring devices and things like that.\n\n101\n00:04:09,345 --> 00:04:10,490\nThat.\nWe can also to what we call\n\n102\n00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,955\nrole-based training.\n\n103\n00:04:11,955 --> 00:04:14,355\n>> Yep.\n>> Where, for specific roles,\n\n104\n00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:16,100\nyou might need a little more instruction.\n\n105\n00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,695\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n106\n00:04:16,695 --> 00:04:17,575\n>> All right?\n\n107\n00:04:17,575 --> 00:04:20,185\nSo, something specific\nto your particular job.\n\n108\n00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:23,450\nMaybe, you're the person that\nhandles The backup tapes, right?\n\n109\n00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,330\nSo you've got to know what our procedures\nare if you're rolling those things around\n\n110\n00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,940\non a cart you can't park that cart\nsomewhere and go to the bathroom.\n\n111\n00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,440\n>> Right?\n>> Sure.\n\n112\n00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,030\n>> Things like that.\n\n113\n00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,200\nMaybe I don't need to teach everybody\n\n114\n00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,080\nthat, but\njust the people that do the backups.\n\n115\n00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,210\n>> Yeah, it really coincides with\nan access control type that we say\n\n116\n00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,610\nrole based access control.\n\n117\n00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,050\nAnd those roles within that company\ncan have different access levels,\n\n118\n00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,460\nyou know administrators typically\nhave more privileges and\n\n119\n00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,570\nwill have more privileges\nthan standard users.\n\n120\n00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:50,010\nWhen you implement that most companies do.\n\n121\n00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,720\nYou'll have standard users,\nyou'll have a security team,\n\n122\n00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,930\nyou'll have the backup operators,\nrestoration operators.\n\n123\n00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,400\nAnd for each one of these roles they\nmight define specific needs, you know,\n\n124\n00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,360\nspecific security needs and security\nawareness that we definitely have to make\n\n125\n00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,120\nthose people that are in that role or that\nposition, aware of some of the risks and\n\n126\n00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,140\nsome of the vulnerabilities\nthat they could face for\n\n127\n00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,910\nthose higher levels of privilege and\naccess.\n\n128\n00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,690\n>> Absolutely.\n\n129\n00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,170\nSo, additional training for specific roles\nso we can make sure that they're aware of\n\n130\n00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,070\nanything that might be specific\nto their job and their function.\n\n131\n00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,300\nMake sure they're trained up on that.\n\n132\n00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,450\nAnd then of course, cross training,\nmaking sure that other people,\n\n133\n00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,450\nyou know we talked the other day about-\n>> Succession planning?\n\n134\n00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,710\n>> Succession planning,\n\n135\n00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,070\nmaking sure that that person that's\nin line to take over that job.\n\n136\n00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,060\nIf something happens to that person,\n\n137\n00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,972\nIs also trained\n>> Yes.\n\n138\n00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,080\n>> Right?\n>> In those same security policies and\n\n139\n00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,130\nprocedures so when they step into\nthat job they're ready to go and\n\n140\n00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,690\nthey already know all the nitty\ngritty about what is expected and\n\n141\n00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,490\nwhat is required and things like that.\n\n142\n00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,000\n>> And it's a redundant happening, too.\n\n143\n00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,100\n>> Right.\n>> This doesn't just happen once.\n\n144\n00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,490\nYou were saying at yesterday's episode.\n\n145\n00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,090\nMaybe it happens annually.\n\n146\n00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:02,550\nMaybe it happens quarterly or something.\n\n147\n00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,650\n>> Quarterly or something, I don't know.\n\n148\n00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,690\n>> Yeah.\nAnd then constantly reviewing it because\n\n149\n00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,850\nas your company grows and progresses, it\ntakes on more, you know, different types\n\n150\n00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,630\nof data, you know, different types of,\nyou know, infrastructure.\n\n151\n00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,670\nWe've got Cloud now.\n\n152\n00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,720\nAnd we've had Cloud for awhile but\nas it becomes more and more Important.\n\n153\n00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,050\nYou know you've got a new trend with BYOD.\n\n154\n00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,250\nBringing your own device to work.\n\n155\n00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,400\nAnd it presents more challengers, and\n\n156\n00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,110\nit presents bigger attack surfaces so\npeople have to be aware.\n\n157\n00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:30,720\nThey have to be aware as to what\nthe current security stance is for\n\n158\n00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,800\nthose different technologies\nthat are coming out.\n\n159\n00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,930\nSo we always revolving.\n\n160\n00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,020\n>> Absolutely.\n\n161\n00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,070\nCause, you know, we've got to keep up.\n\n162\n00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,140\nAnd, you know,\n\n163\n00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,670\none of the things I love about security is\nthe fact that it does change all the time.\n\n164\n00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,260\n>> Mhmmm.\n>> RIght?\n\n165\n00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,670\nAnd it's, you don't get bored with it.\n\n166\n00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,340\nBecause there's always\nsomething new coming out.\n\n167\n00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,190\nThere's new.\n\n168\n00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,970\nNew ways to attack machines.\n\n169\n00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,210\nNew fishing scams that are being thrown\nout there that you've got to research so\n\n170\n00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,250\nthat you can train your employees on and\nthings like that.\n\n171\n00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,150\nSo if you get into security\nI hope you like to learn.\n\n172\n00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,590\nBecause you're gonna be learning.\n\n173\n00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,815\nIt's gonna be [INAUDIBLE].\n\n174\n00:07:03,815 --> 00:07:06,255\nIt's not like you learn it and\nit just never changes.\n\n175\n00:07:06,255 --> 00:07:06,995\nYeah.\n>> You know,\n\n176\n00:07:06,995 --> 00:07:08,785\nI heard a good point one time and\n\n177\n00:07:08,785 --> 00:07:12,055\nI might have got this from Security Now,\ncause you know, I watch it a lot.\n\n178\n00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:13,985\nI figured, it was some security guru,\n\n179\n00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:16,930\nthat said, security is not\na destination to be reached.\n\n180\n00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,040\nBut a journey to be travelled upon.\n\n181\n00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,010\n>> I like that.\n\n182\n00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,730\n>> I can't remember.\n\n183\n00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,550\nIt's not mine I was\nreading it somewhere and\n\n184\n00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,380\nit was somebody that, probably from MIT.\n\n185\n00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,670\nYou know like RSA or maybe one of\nthose three guys or something.\n\n186\n00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,160\nThat always stuck with me.\n\n187\n00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,540\n>> Yeah\n>> You're never going to reach that\n\n188\n00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,160\ndestination, there's no such thing\nas a completely secure network.\n\n189\n00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,704\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, get on and get ready for the ride.\n\n190\n00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:38,275\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n191\n00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:39,660\nEnjoy it, enjoy it.\n\n192\n00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,610\nAll right, what are some other\nterms we need to talk about here?\n\n193\n00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,490\nPersonally identifiable information.\n\n194\n00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,210\nWe've heard that term a lot,\nespecially over the last.\n\n195\n00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:52,581\nFew years with all the different\nidentity thefts that go on and\n\n196\n00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:54,607\nscams and things like that.\n\n197\n00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,172\nBut personally identifiable\ninformation is just that.\n\n198\n00:07:57,172 --> 00:08:00,419\nInformation that can be\nused solely on it's own or\n\n199\n00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,590\npossibly with other\ninformation that can lead or\n\n200\n00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,028\ngive me the ability to identify\nthe individual or specific person.\n\n201\n00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:13,010\n>> That's right, for instance if\nIT ProTV has got to get a hold of you.\n\n202\n00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,480\nThey've got you know,\nthe avenues to get a hold of you.\n\n203\n00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,470\nWell, that information, if it get's\nin the wrong hands, well guess what?\n\n204\n00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,270\nSomebody else can get ahold of you, too.\n\n205\n00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,290\nMaybe it's not somebody you want visiting,\nyou know,\n\n206\n00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,020\nyour house or calling your phone.\n\n207\n00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,579\nAt whatever time in the,\nyou know, over the night.\n\n208\n00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:32,300\nYeah, a company needs to\nsecure that information.\n\n209\n00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,800\nAnd that information just can't be\nmade to the public because it's a very\n\n210\n00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,780\nbig\n>> Huh.\n\n211\n00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,790\n>> Security vulnerability.\n\n212\n00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,320\n>> Absolutely.\n>> So\n\n213\n00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,870\nwe need to keep that information safe, and\n\n214\n00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,410\nit also goes where we were talking\nabout data backups and stuff.\n\n215\n00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,160\n>> Huh.\n>> We have to know where that information\n\n216\n00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,780\nis residing, where it's being retained,\n>> Huh.\n\n217\n00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,330\n>> And if it's being retained, is it\nbeing retained in a secure environment.\n\n218\n00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:51,860\n>> Exactly.\n\n219\n00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,780\nExactly.\n\n220\n00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:57,530\nWe're talking about things like, having\nfingerprints on file for some companies,\n\n221\n00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:01,770\nit could be phone numbers,\nemail addresses, license plates.\n\n222\n00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,610\nRight?\nWe take down people's license plates so\n\n223\n00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,980\nwe know it's only employees\nparking in our parking lot.\n\n224\n00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,940\nWell, that information is personally\nidentifiable information.\n\n225\n00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,350\nIf somebody gets a hold of that list,\nthey could potentially use that\n\n226\n00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,820\nto start some kind of identity scam,\nor something like credit card numbers.\n\n227\n00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,285\nGosh, the list goes on.\n\n228\n00:09:21,285 --> 00:09:23,560\n>> Yeah, with it being a billion\ndollar industry you know,\n\n229\n00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,650\nthe sun never sets on hackers.\n\n230\n00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,560\nThere's always somebody out there and\nin fact if the sun does set a lot of times\n\n231\n00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,264\nthey're probably some of\ntheir best work at night.\n\n232\n00:09:33,264 --> 00:09:34,670\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n233\n00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:39,630\ninformation classification is one of the\nways, Wes was kinda leading into there,\n\n234\n00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,820\nwhen we look at our information\nwe want to try to classify.\n\n235\n00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,080\nBecause classifying is\ngonna help me determine\n\n236\n00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,550\nhow I need to protect that information and\nhow I need to retain that information.\n\n237\n00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,590\nBecause we have some\ninformation that's not secure.\n\n238\n00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:57,740\nIt doesn't need the same level\nof protection as other data.\n\n239\n00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,150\nSo, by classifying it, it allows us to\n\n240\n00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,620\nreally figure out how we want to work with\nthat data, how we want to store that data,\n\n241\n00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,710\nhow long we need to retain that data and\nthings like that.\n\n242\n00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,040\nThey list a few of them here but these\nare by no means, set in stone, right?\n\n243\n00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,420\n>> No, because military as\ntheir classifications too and\n\n244\n00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,631\nwe're not really so much talking.\n\n245\n00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:19,780\nI mean guess you could talk military\nclassification but, you know, businesses\n\n246\n00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,180\ncould be a little bit different and one of\nthe things we've got to keep in mind, for\n\n247\n00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,830\ninstance they talk about\npublic information, right?\n\n248\n00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,300\nWell we were mentioning yesterday in\nthe episodes about DMZ's and stuff,\n\n249\n00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,170\nwell you have a website out\nthere that has your products.\n\n250\n00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,907\nIt has whatever it is that your business\nis providing, whatever service.\n\n251\n00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:39,330\nWell that's public information and that's\ninformation that we don't really have to.\n\n252\n00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,570\nI guess in some aspects\nyou have to secure it so\n\n253\n00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,950\nsomebody doesn't attack your website.\n\n254\n00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,760\n>> Right.\n>> But then you mentioned the SQL server\n\n255\n00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,640\nwhere all that information is stored.\n\n256\n00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,130\nThere's credit card information.\n\n257\n00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,910\nNow that's a little bit different, and\n\n258\n00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:54,000\nthat could probably be classified as\nconfidential or private if you will.\n\n259\n00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,330\n>> Right.\n\n260\n00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,220\nUsing whatever scheme you want to use.\n\n261\n00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,290\nThey talk about it a lot in compte a lot\nof times we'll list out high, medium,\n\n262\n00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:06,960\nlow or confidential, private,\npublic and things like that.\n\n263\n00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,959\nThink about your spy movies and\nmilitary movies and\n\n264\n00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,237\nthings like that, Top Secret,\nFor Your Eyes Only, or\n\n265\n00:11:15,237 --> 00:11:20,127\nSecret of a Non-Confidential [CROSSTALK]\n>> Restricted, unrestricted,\n\n266\n00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:23,458\nso there's different levels and\nI guess it just depends on what\n\n267\n00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:25,160\n>> You know, demographic is.\n\n268\n00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,960\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n269\n00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,990\nIf your business wants to call it one,\ntwo, and three, I mean you can.\n\n270\n00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,620\nYou know?\nYou can call it, Bob and Sue.\n\n271\n00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,510\n>> We use stickers.\n\n272\n00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,255\nAll the colors.\n\n273\n00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:33,800\n[Laughs.]\n>> Yeah.\n\n274\n00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,978\nSo, it's whatever works for you.\n\n275\n00:11:34,978 --> 00:11:39,665\nAnd then this a lot of times leads\ninto our mandatory access control.\n\n276\n00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,405\nAnd a lot of times our labels are our\ncategories and you can call it\n\n277\n00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:45,515\nanything you want, you can call them\nlabels, you can call them categories.\n\n278\n00:11:45,515 --> 00:11:47,215\nBut this is usually the basis for\n\n279\n00:11:47,215 --> 00:11:51,095\na mandatory access control system\nwhere we're talking about,\n\n280\n00:11:51,095 --> 00:11:55,055\nrather than discretionary access control\nlike we see a lot in Windows and\n\n281\n00:11:55,055 --> 00:12:00,450\nNTFS with mandatory access control,\nyou're assigned a category or a level.\n\n282\n00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,480\nAnd the resources have labels\n>> Right\n\n283\n00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,290\n>> Or levels or categories and\n\n284\n00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:08,190\nif your label matches or\nis higher than the document or\n\n285\n00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,500\nthe resource then you gain access to it.\n\n286\n00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,920\n>> Like duplicity in your security\n\n287\n00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,580\n>> Yeah\n>> Identifiers.\n\n288\n00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,460\nNow we have two.\n\n289\n00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:18,860\n>> Exactly so that's where you see\na lot of times you see these labels\n\n290\n00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,140\nin these categories is in\na mandatory access control system.\n\n291\n00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:28,280\nBut even if we're not using a Mac type\nsystem, we'll still label the data.\n\n292\n00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,720\nBecause as I said, it leads into our\nnext topic of handling a disposal.\n\n293\n00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,510\nAs you were saying,\nsome data is not sensitive.\n\n294\n00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,620\nIt doesn't need to have that\nsame level of protection.\n\n295\n00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,980\nWhere as other data might\nbe super sensitive.\n\n296\n00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,550\nIt might contain personally\nidentifiable information.\n\n297\n00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,910\nSo I label it that way so\nthat when we're backing it up,\n\n298\n00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,970\nwe might back that up\nseparate from the other data.\n\n299\n00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,230\nKeep it separate, and maybe we\nhandle it a little bit differently\n\n300\n00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,020\nbecause of the sensitivity\nof that information.\n\n301\n00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,190\n>> Store it on a hard drive, maybe even\nas far as taking out of the computer and\n\n302\n00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:01,880\nstoring the hard drive in a safe,\nif it's gonna be retained for a while.\n\n303\n00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,410\nBecause we also have to maintain\nthe integrity of that information too.\n\n304\n00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,870\nAnd when it comes to not just\nthe handling of that information, but\n\n305\n00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,160\nthe secure handling of that information,\nif it's gonna be in transit and\n\n306\n00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,390\nhow do we secure it in transit.\n\n307\n00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:16,630\nIs it gonna be sneakernet where we're\nwalking it from point A to point B or\n\n308\n00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,900\nis it over the network And\n\n309\n00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:24,510\ndo we we have to employ some kind of\nencryption in that aspect or disposal?\n\n310\n00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,510\nSecure disposal.\n\n311\n00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,970\nYou guys have probably seen out there,\n\n312\n00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,770\nquite a few of you have probably seen out\nthere where you have on-site shredders.\n\n313\n00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:36,290\nWhere the truck comes right to the company\nand the trash can or however you want\n\n314\n00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,640\nto say it, the bin that these documents\nare held in are under lock and key.\n\n315\n00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,340\nAnd the only person that can open those\nis the company that's got that license,\n\n316\n00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,030\nthey're bonded, they're insured.\n\n317\n00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:49,070\nAnd they take it into the truck\nright away and they shred it,\n\n318\n00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,290\nwhether it be optical media,\nwhether it be paper media.\n\n319\n00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,190\nAnd they even have Shredding hard drives,\ntoo.\n\n320\n00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:58,050\n>> I was just gonna say, let me see\nif I can pull this up real quick.\n\n321\n00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,594\nThe first time I saw it is I was like,\nwow that's kinda cool.\n\n322\n00:13:59,594 --> 00:14:02,375\nIt's like the old ass plunge tree\nshredders or something like that.\n\n323\n00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,365\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Right, so you do bulk shredding and\n\n324\n00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:06,810\ndisposal of the the media,\nand it can do it in large\n\n325\n00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,820\n>> Quantities.\n\n326\n00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,680\nThere you go.\n\n327\n00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,690\nThere we go.\n\n328\n00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:11,530\n>> I mean that is just pulverizing.\n\n329\n00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,290\n>> Just like butter.\n\n330\n00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,030\n>> Look at that.\n\n331\n00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,230\nWhat is that, an old CD-ROM drive?\n\n332\n00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,420\nThere is it, the large one.\n\n333\n00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,500\nLook at that thing go crunch.\n\n334\n00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,481\n>> That's like a 10 MB drive.\n\n335\n00:14:20,481 --> 00:14:22,400\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So some different ways\n\n336\n00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,109\nwe talked about disposal and we'll come\nback to probably a little bit more of that\n\n337\n00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,390\n>> So adding the data handling.\n\n338\n00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:34,350\nMaybe you've got documents that,\nI'm going to allow these people to view\n\n339\n00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,980\nthese documents only if\nthey're on a work computer.\n\n340\n00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,980\nNot if they're on their\nown personal device or\n\n341\n00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,450\nwhen they're remote desktopping in.\n\n342\n00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,570\nEspecially now that with Windows we\ncan do that dynamic access control\n\n343\n00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,190\nwhere I can make some\ndecision based on that.\n\n344\n00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,520\nWhere I can say manager you're allowed\nto look at these payroll reports\n\n345\n00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,900\nif you're at your computer.\n\n346\n00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,500\nIf you're at Bob's computer down the hall\nyou don't get access to the document.\n\n347\n00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,560\nAnd by adding these classifications\nthat's going to allow me to determine,\n\n348\n00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,410\nwhat documents I have to add\nthat type of restriction to.\n\n349\n00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,080\n>> Right, so conditional access.\n\n350\n00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,050\nThat is very cool.\n\n351\n00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:04,800\n>> Absolutely.\n\n352\n00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,410\nAnd then as we were saying with disposal.\n\n353\n00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:10,835\nWith disposal of your documents or\nyour data, if they were hard copies.\n\n354\n00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:13,915\nYou have some of it,\njust toss it in the recycle bin.\n\n355\n00:15:13,915 --> 00:15:15,295\nIt's non-sensitive stuff.\n\n356\n00:15:15,295 --> 00:15:17,553\nOthers, we have to go\nthrough a special process.\n\n357\n00:15:17,553 --> 00:15:21,597\nLike you were saying, have shredders come\nout a lot of businesses that I've worked\n\n358\n00:15:21,597 --> 00:15:24,390\nat had a trash can with a lock\non the lid and a slot in there.\n\n359\n00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,868\nYou could put paper in and you couldn't\nget anything out having that lock and\n\n360\n00:15:27,868 --> 00:15:31,017\nthen that company just comes back,\npicks up that trash can dumps it,\n\n361\n00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:32,994\njust like you said, does it right on site.\n\n362\n00:15:32,994 --> 00:15:36,226\nSo, you can verify that they're not\ntaking that information somewhere-\n\n363\n00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:36,790\n>> That's right\n\n364\n00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,130\n>> And sifting through it and\n\n365\n00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,360\ndoing anything like that.\n\n366\n00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,580\nThere was something I read not too long\nago about a company that was doing that.\n\n367\n00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,400\nThey were charging people to dispose of\nthis data securely, and they weren't.\n\n368\n00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,460\nThey weren't stealing the data but they\nwere just dumping it in a normal dump.\n\n369\n00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,570\nWhich all of a sudden is okay\nwell I can do that, you know?\n\n370\n00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,210\nI don't want my information to dump\nwhere somebody can pick it up.\n\n371\n00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,390\nIt has to be destroyed.\n\n372\n00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,120\nSo.\n>> And that leads to a topic that we've\n\n373\n00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,379\ntalked about in security\nplus dumpster diving.\n\n374\n00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:02,598\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n375\n00:16:02,598 --> 00:16:04,766\nAbsolutely.\nAbsolutely, it's an easy way,\n\n376\n00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:06,598\npeople don't think about it.\n\n377\n00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,670\nYou know one of the things I\nalways talk about sticky notes,\n\n378\n00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,020\nbecause sticky notes are one\nof the banes of security.\n\n379\n00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,950\nUntil USB come along,\nI think sticky note, thumb drives.\n\n380\n00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,680\n>> Wait a second, did you see my password?\n\n381\n00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,940\n>> I mean you find them everywhere.\n\n382\n00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,520\nWell people use them to make quick notes.\n\n383\n00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,550\nYou're on the phone and they say hey,\nwrite down this account number.\n\n384\n00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,020\nAnd check and\nsee if you can blah blah blah with it.\n\n385\n00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,100\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n>> And I do.\n\n386\n00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,050\nI stick it on my monitor.\n\n387\n00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,450\nEventually I get around to checking on it.\n\n388\n00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,660\nI take that sticky note and\nI throw it in the garbage.\n\n389\n00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,230\n>> Yeah.\n>> If there's somebody's name and\n\n390\n00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,470\naccount number now on that\nsticky note that I just,\n\n391\n00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,500\nthat I didn't even think about\n>> Taking down the secure\n\n392\n00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,140\ndisposal,\n>> That's right, leads to things like\n\n393\n00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,320\nshoulder surfing which we'll talk about,\nif we haven't already talked about in\n\n394\n00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,590\nsecurity flaws,and some of the other\nsecurity episodes that we, you know,\n\n395\n00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,200\nsomebody just literally\nwalking by that cubicle.\n\n396\n00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,380\nYou talk about where do some\nof the threats come from but\n\n397\n00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,850\na lot of times those threats\n>> Are internal.\n\n398\n00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,040\n>> Yeah.\nI'll tell you another one that's really\n\n399\n00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,950\ngood when talking about disposal\nof documents is gonna be\n\n400\n00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:05,440\nthe old blotter calendars\nat the desktop calendars?\n\n401\n00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,450\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> At the end of the year,\n\n402\n00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,670\nJanuary is a great time to go looking for\nthese, because people throw away.\n\n403\n00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,250\nThey've got last year's desktop calendar\nsitting there Or the little calendar,\n\n404\n00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,420\nthe flippy thing that you write all\nof your little appointments in and\n\n405\n00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,470\nstuff like that.\n\n406\n00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,110\nEnd of the year, they're throwing\nit away and getting one for 2015.\n\n407\n00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:24,180\nThink about all of the things you wrote\ndown in your calendar over the year.\n\n408\n00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,320\nAppointments, meetings, phone numbers,\nand contact information, account numbers,\n\n409\n00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,770\nthere could be all kinds of\nsensitive information on there and\n\n410\n00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,640\npeople don't think about it It's\njust my calendar, all right.\n\n411\n00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,470\nI remembered to shred these documents\nhere, but I didn't even think about\n\n412\n00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,960\ntearing that page out of my calendar and\nthrowing it away.\n\n413\n00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,610\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n414\n00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:45,340\nAnd that leads to a profiling where\nthey can look at all this information\n\n415\n00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,680\nthat's on these calendars and\nbasically just assume your identity.\n\n416\n00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,540\nAnd if anyone wants to ask checks,\nverbal checks or\n\n417\n00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,470\nbalances, they can say, oh, yeah, yeah\n>> Well, Sally and\n\n418\n00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:59,010\nI went last week at lunch at 12 o'clock\nand they didn't really know that,\n\n419\n00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,890\nthey're looking down at that calendar at\nthat little scratch note that said hey,\n\n420\n00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,660\nwe're gonna go out and\nhave some lunch at this time.\n\n421\n00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,535\nIf it's social engineering and\n>> Somebody\n\n422\n00:18:06,535 --> 00:18:09,715\non the other line that maybe just started\nthere, they don't know who you are.\n\n423\n00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:13,235\nThey say oh, I know Sally,\nI haven't met you yet.\n\n424\n00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:17,965\nSo it's just leads a foothold\ninto basically into your company.\n\n425\n00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:18,465\n>> Absolutely.\n\n426\n00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,600\nWe gotta make sure that we\nare labeling our data so that we can\n\n427\n00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,090\ndetermine how we need to handle that data,\nand maintain and then dispose of.\n\n428\n00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,480\nWhat else we talked about?\n\n429\n00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,750\nData labeling, data handling,\ndata disposal.\n\n430\n00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,370\nCompliance with laws,\nbest practices and standards.\n\n431\n00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,740\nOne of the things that we've gotta think\nabout when we're creating our policies for\n\n432\n00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,060\nour company is going to be,\nthere might be laws in place.\n\n433\n00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,210\nThere might be local regulations or\nindustry regulations.\n\n434\n00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,230\n>> Sure.\nOr federal regulations, and\n\n435\n00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,600\ndifferent countries have\ntheir own sets of rules.\n\n436\n00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,070\nSo for your country you got\nto know what do the laws say.\n\n437\n00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,530\nLike here in the U.S. we have HIPA.\n\n438\n00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,060\nThat's going to make sure that if I'm\nmaintaining healthcare information,\n\n439\n00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,700\npatient information, we've got\ncertain laws that we have to comply\n\n440\n00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,000\nwith that we have to make sure that\nthis data is stored in a certain way,\n\n441\n00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,445\nprotected in a certain way, and\ndisposed of in a certain way.\n\n442\n00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:14,670\nSo, not my company's policies,\n\n443\n00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,260\nthis is a federal regulation that,\nin the US, we would have to follow.\n\n444\n00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,290\nBest practices?\n\n445\n00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,910\nYou're looking at other industries.\n\n446\n00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,800\nYou're not the first business\nof this type, most likely.\n\n447\n00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,850\nSo, you can look at other businesses\nthat do the same kind of thing and\n\n448\n00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,830\nyou can learn from them.\n\n449\n00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,470\nYou can share best practices.\n\n450\n00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:37,900\nA lot of vendors published best practice\ninformation for their types of devices.\n\n451\n00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,300\nSo, when it comes to your setting up your\n\n452\n00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,625\npolicies you might want to talk to other\npeople that have maybe done this before,\n\n453\n00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,670\nworked in the same field and\nhave some good ideas.\n\n454\n00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:53,170\nAnd then standards that are put\nout by different organizations.\n\n455\n00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,010\n>> That's right.\n>> That we want to try to follow it.\n\n456\n00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,860\n>> And we also have, for instance,\ninterdepartmental policies.\n\n457\n00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,250\nWe talk a lot about WIN links and\n\n458\n00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:04,270\nsometimes that data crosses\ninternational boundaries.\n\n459\n00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,210\nAnd is it gonna be a policy that's\nhere set in place in the States or\n\n460\n00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,050\nI don't know if your WIN link\nhappens to go into Europe.\n\n461\n00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:16,140\nyou know maybe you're collaborating\nwith someone on Japanese soil or\n\n462\n00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,550\nsomething like that.\n\n463\n00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,290\nSo you know you can have\nmultiple international laws and\n\n464\n00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:26,250\neven those local, if you will federal laws\nof other countries that you also have to\n\n465\n00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,260\nkeep in mind as well.\n\n466\n00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:27,940\n>> Right.\n\n467\n00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,460\nAbsolutely.\n\n468\n00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,539\nAlright user habits.\n\n469\n00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,500\nAs I was saying toward the beginning\nepisode, most of our breaches do typically\n\n470\n00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,950\noccur, as Paul put up there in\nthe chatroom, at that layer eight.\n\n471\n00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,560\n>> Yes.\n>> What's that old epithet?\n\n472\n00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,900\nProblem exists between keyboard and chair.\n\n473\n00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,790\nThe old IED 10T errors,\nand that kind of thing.\n\n474\n00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,940\nBut they do, a lot of them occur there\nbecause they're the ones that are down in\n\n475\n00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,975\nthe trenches, so to speak.\n\n476\n00:20:57,975 --> 00:21:02,540\nOr they're the ones that are using the\ndata, that are accessing that information.\n\n477\n00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,720\nSo those are the ones that we\nneed to make sure understand\n\n478\n00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,940\nhow to do it in a secure fashion, what\nis required, what is expected of them.\n\n479\n00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,680\nAnd what they need to do when they're\nworking with different data types, or\n\n480\n00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,240\ndifferent categories of data.\n\n481\n00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:15,740\n>> That's right.\n\n482\n00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,740\nEven just our systems, even if they're\nnot, just logging on to system or\n\n483\n00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,740\naccess to a door, or access to an area\nthat's got a PIN on it, a keypad on it,\n\n484\n00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,050\nor a smart card authentication.\n\n485\n00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:32,820\nIt all comes down to, they talk about\none authentication, one entrance.\n\n486\n00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,120\nWhether it's a door, whether it's\na system, we don't share passwords.\n\n487\n00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,320\nPassword complexities.\n\n488\n00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,420\nWe talk about making sure that you're\nusing Multiple character sets, if you can,\n\n489\n00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:47,150\nuse all of them, increase the characters,\ndon't write them down.\n\n490\n00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,610\nThat's some of the ones I can think of.\n\n491\n00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,180\n>> Absolutely,\nI'll tell you I may be a little\n\n492\n00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,440\ndifferent than a lot of people\nwhen it comes to passwords.\n\n493\n00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,920\nI love talking to end users, and\ntrying to teach them security and\n\n494\n00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,170\nthings like that and password behaviors\nwe want to make sure they understand one,\n\n495\n00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,770\nwhat a strong password is.\n\n496\n00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,510\nThat doesn't mean they have the word\nstrong in their password somewhere.\n\n497\n00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,730\nSo we have to teach them\nthese practices and\n\n498\n00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,280\nI don't think this is the episode\nwe're going to go into detail on it,\n\n499\n00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,420\nbut we'll talk about what a good,\nstrong password is.\n\n500\n00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,250\nHow to come up with a good,\nstrong password.\n\n501\n00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,820\nI can tell you you can write them down.\n\n502\n00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,180\nI don't think it's fair\nto our users to say\n\n503\n00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,470\nyou can't use the same password\nin more than one place.\n\n504\n00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,660\nThey have to be long, they have to\nbe strong, they have to be complex.\n\n505\n00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,210\nBut you can't write them down at all.\n\n506\n00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,740\nRight?\nSo I think when most people say you can't\n\n507\n00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,240\nwrite them down they\nleave a little bit out.\n\n508\n00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,090\nYou can't write them down where\nsomebody is going to find them or\n\n509\n00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,220\nwhere someone has access to them.\n\n510\n00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,940\nI mean for you gentlemen out there how\nmany people can get into your wallet\n\n511\n00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,250\nwithout you knowing about it?\n\n512\n00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:44,860\nFor the ladies,\n\n513\n00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,210\nhow many people can get into your\npurse without you knowing about it?\n\n514\n00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:50,110\nSo if I write a password down,\nI'm not sticking it to my monitor.\n\n515\n00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,560\nI'm not taping it to the bottom side of\nmy keyboard and it might be in my wallet.\n\n516\n00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,980\nAnd as you say, maybe I don't write it\ndown, maybe I write it down backwards, or\n\n517\n00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,675\nmaybe I add a couple characters.\n\n518\n00:22:59,675 --> 00:23:01,935\nCharacters to the beginning and\nthe end when I write it down.\n\n519\n00:23:01,935 --> 00:23:04,225\nAnd only I know when I\ntype that password in.\n\n520\n00:23:04,225 --> 00:23:07,815\nI've got to take those four characters\noff to have the right password.\n\n521\n00:23:07,815 --> 00:23:09,725\nI've written them down that way.\n\n522\n00:23:09,725 --> 00:23:11,565\nWhere there was a password\nthat I wanted to write down.\n\n523\n00:23:11,565 --> 00:23:13,425\nAnd you guys aren't going to find it,\n\n524\n00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:16,165\nbecause now that I'm telling you,\nI'm going to change it.\n\n525\n00:23:16,165 --> 00:23:19,635\nWhere I had only one special\ncharacter in the password.\n\n526\n00:23:19,635 --> 00:23:21,375\nAnd I wrote it down,\n\n527\n00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:25,740\nand put literally 50 Special characters\nin between all the jumbled up numbers.\n\n528\n00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,460\n>> Right yeah.\n\n529\n00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:30,020\n>> So nobody could really tell what my\npassword is cuz there's only one special\n\n530\n00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,680\ncharacter in there that's\npart of my password.\n\n531\n00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,920\n>> Nobody knows what 30 special\ncharacters to drop out of there.\n\n532\n00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,520\n>> Yeah,\nthey didn't know which ones to take out.\n\n533\n00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,460\nSo it's kinda like a I guess a really\nsimplistic form of encryption.\n\n534\n00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,320\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n535\n00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,640\nAnd that way I got it written down and\nI can, maybe it's a password that's really\n\n536\n00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,020\nlong and strong and complex but\nI don't use it that often.\n\n537\n00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,430\nAnd that's the one that always gets me,\nI'll change the password.\n\n538\n00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,720\nAnd then not log into the place for\na few days and\n\n539\n00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,420\ngo aw smack what the heck\ndid I change that to?\n\n540\n00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,520\nBut if I had written it down,\nI like using programs like Lastpass and\n\n541\n00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,800\nyou know those password safes and\nthings like that.\n\n542\n00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,639\n>> That's right.\n>> That always makes me nervous because\n\n543\n00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:08,444\nthen if it ever craps out I won't be\nable to get into my bank account,\n\n544\n00:24:08,444 --> 00:24:10,730\nI won't be able to get into\nyou know that kind of thing.\n\n545\n00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,604\n>> I won't be able to get\ninto my Pinterest account and\n\n546\n00:24:12,604 --> 00:24:13,569\nthat's gonna bother me.\n\n547\n00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:16,331\nYou know Ronnie and\nNate were going off on Pinterest today.\n\n548\n00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:17,619\nIt's sorta funny that you mentioned that.\n\n549\n00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:18,886\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n550\n00:24:18,886 --> 00:24:20,029\n>> I think that Ronnie said it was\n\n551\n00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:20,628\nhis homepage.\n\n552\n00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:23,228\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I doubt that.\n\n553\n00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:27,604\n[LAUGH] See, see?\n\n554\n00:24:27,604 --> 00:24:28,266\n>> Jason's got it.\n\n555\n00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,300\nSee, Jason's got it, that's right.\n\n556\n00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,810\nThat's right.\n\n557\n00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,200\n[LAUGH] Oh, shoot.\n\n558\n00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,930\nSo yeah you know,\n\n559\n00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:38,410\nteaching them good strong password\ncreation techniques, things like that.\n\n560\n00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,620\nData handling is another area that\nwe want to make sure that our users\n\n561\n00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,750\nhave good habits.\n\n562\n00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,160\nThat if they've got hard\ncopies of documents,\n\n563\n00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,640\nthey don't leave them laying around.\n\n564\n00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:52,010\nThat when they've got sensitive\ninformation on their screen\n\n565\n00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:56,320\nthat their screen is not maybe\nvisible from the doorway.\n\n566\n00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,206\nCubicles are the worst because\nwhen you walk into a cubicle,\n\n567\n00:25:00,206 --> 00:25:01,730\nyou almost always have the doorways here.\n\n568\n00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,130\nSo it just makes sense to put the desk\non the other side of the cubicle.\n\n569\n00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,750\nSo your monitor's sitting there typically\nfacing right back towards the doorway.\n\n570\n00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,960\nAnd so if you get up and\ngo down to the watering hole or\n\n571\n00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,100\nsomething like that,\nthat screen needs to be locked.\n\n572\n00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,420\nThat needs to cover that information so\nthat somebody walking by.\n\n573\n00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,300\nI always laughed at,you know\nthe bubble screensaver?\n\n574\n00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,260\nYou know it was clear,\n\n575\n00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,390\nthe bubbles go around you can see\nthe data right through the dern bubbles.\n\n576\n00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,160\nLike okay, that's brilliant.\n\n577\n00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,636\n>> And that's a part of,\n\n578\n00:25:26,636 --> 00:25:31,860\nwhen we say user habits even though\nthey're not specifically called out here.\n\n579\n00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,110\nWhen you walk away from a machine,\nif you're in Windows, Windows Key+L.\n\n580\n00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:40,409\nAs a last resort, you implement\na screen saver that requires a password\n\n581\n00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:45,020\nto come back to an productive\nor.an active desktop.\n\n582\n00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,710\nSo they should be logging\noff at the end of the day.\n\n583\n00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,340\nThere's no reason to leave\nyourself logged in with 15 web\n\n584\n00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,990\nbrowsers open on your desktop.\n\n585\n00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,340\n>> Because those are still connections.\n\n586\n00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,919\nThey're not unused connections, they're\nactive connections even if you've locked\n\n587\n00:25:56,919 --> 00:25:58,865\nyour machine and\nyou've left your machine on.\n\n588\n00:25:58,865 --> 00:26:03,180\nAnd those could be attack points that\nsomebody can make their way into your\n\n589\n00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,470\nnetwork at night with nobody there.\n\n590\n00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,360\n>> Absolutely,\nI can't tell you how may times,\n\n591\n00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,080\nI used to work with\na training company that had\n\n592\n00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,550\nstudents that actually came into\nthe building and sat at computers.\n\n593\n00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:16,750\nAnd at the end of the day, you know,\nI would go around typically and make sure\n\n594\n00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:20,070\nall of the applications were closed, and\nclean up the computers for the next day.\n\n595\n00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:24,060\nI can't tell you how many times I would\nfind somebody's email program open.\n\n596\n00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,700\n>> You've never done that to me, have you?\n\n597\n00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,220\n>> No, never.\n\n598\n00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:31,664\nVPNed into their work network and\ntheir VPN connection is still active.\n\n599\n00:26:31,664 --> 00:26:34,120\nThese are the things we have\nto teach the end users.\n\n600\n00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,610\nHey, look, I don't mind you creating a VPN\nconnection while you're out there at this\n\n601\n00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:38,600\ntraining session.\n\n602\n00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,010\nSo you can get some work done during\nlunch or check on some data or\n\n603\n00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,000\nsomething like that.\n\n604\n00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,504\nBut for gosh sakes, make sure you\nclose it down when you're done.\n\n605\n00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:49,530\n>> I'm guilty of this and\nI kinda joke with Mike there.\n\n606\n00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,460\nThat's kinda like a little inside joke but\nI didn't think about it having\n\n607\n00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,950\na little password management\nsoftware like LastPass.\n\n608\n00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,300\nIt's a great piece of software.\n\n609\n00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,380\nI completely forgot that for ease of use,\n\n610\n00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,180\nbecause I would be needing to get to\nthese different sites on the fly.\n\n611\n00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,620\nI had myself autolog on.\n\n612\n00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:12,290\nAnd unfortunately hen I walked away\nfrom that computer, I didn't do.\n\n613\n00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,320\nIt's do as I say, not as I do.\n\n614\n00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,750\nAnd Mike sits down at the computer and\n\n615\n00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:20,250\nhe's literally has access to

and\n\n658\n00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:06,570\nthe gentleman come out and\nhe was kinda of upset.\n\n659\n00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:10,590\nHe said, you cannot leave these user\ndocuments after you printed them out.\n\n660\n00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,400\nYou don't print them out and\nthen just say, okay,\n\n661\n00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,440\nwell I'll go over to the printer\nin an hour or so and get them.\n\n662\n00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,970\nBecause that get's back to PII,\nI mean, that information is not yours,\n\n663\n00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:19,980\nit's the customer's.\n\n664\n00:29:19,980

some I'm training for\na nuclear power company and\n\n671\n00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,390\nyou know it was the first time\nI had seen anything like.\n\n672\n00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:42,380\nAll their printers were\nin a separate room.\n\n673\n00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,350\n>> And there was a person,\nthat was their job.\n\n674\n00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,950\nYou know the old doors that have\nthe two parts to the door so\n\n675\n00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,710\nthat the bottom can stay closed and\nthe top opens up.\n\n676\n00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,650\n>> And\nyou gotta little kind of table there.\n\n677\n00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,980\nWhen you printed something,\nI had to print something, I was like,\n\n678\n00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,700\nwell were did the printer?\n\n679\n00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,700\nThey're like, it's around the corner\nover there, you'll see the printer.\n\n680\n00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,220\nI walk over there, expecting to see the\nprinter, and it was a room with a person.\n\n681\n00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,085\nAnd you didn't go anywhere\nnear the printer.\n\n682\n00:30:03,085 --> 00:30:04,095\nThey gave you your document.\n\n683\n00:30:04,095 --> 00:30:06,035\n>> They picked up the job,\nthey said what'd you print?\n\n684\n00:30:06,035 --> 00:30:08,355\nAnd they would go and\npick that job up and hand it to you.\n\n685\n00:30:08,355 --> 00:30:11,155\nBecause somebody else could have\nbeen printing something sensitive.\n\n686\n00:30:11,155 --> 00:30:13,995\nAnd they don't want it laying on\nthe printer where somebody can walk by and\n\n687\n00:30:13,995 --> 00:30:15,163\npick it up and things like that.\n\n688\n00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:21,930\nAll right, well, I'll tell you what, let's\ngo ahead and wrap up user habits here.\n\n689\n00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,820\nTailgating, I know we're getting\na little close on our break time here\n\n690\n00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,830\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n691\n00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:30,370\nTailgating, and that's just the act of,\nespecially when we're using some type of\n\n692\n00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,090\naccess device or code,\nlike electronic door locks, and\n\n693\n00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:38,250\nthings like that,\nwhere somebody follows somebody in, right?\n\n694\n00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:43,310\nWe've got RFID, little readers here,\nbut you see it,\n\n695\n00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:46,510\nwhere you've got PIN numbers where you\nhave to enter in, to get in the door.\n\n696\n00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,350\nIf somebody is going to try follow that\nperson in because they don't know the PIN,\n\n697\n00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,120\nthat's tailgating.\n\n698\n00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,700\n>> Yeah, definitely!\n\n699\n00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,650\nWell, how many of you out there probably\nlive in some kind of gated community or\n\n700\n00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:58,660\napartment complex where\nsomebody enters a PIN or\n\n701\n00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,080\nhas got one of those NFC devices and\nit opens the gates.\n\n702\n00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,875\nTwo or three people come in.\n\n703\n00:31:02,875 --> 00:31:03,955\n>> And two or\nthree people come through, yeah.\n\n704\n00:31:03,955 --> 00:31:05,870\n>> Just drive right in behind you.\n\n705\n00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:09,140\n>> Yeah, and now half of those\nmight be legitimate users you know,\n\n706\n00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,580\nthey live there, they just want to take\nthe time to wait for the gate to close.\n\n707\n00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,510\n>> Pull out theirs, wait for\nthe gate to open all over again, but\n\n708\n00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,415\nsome of them are not right.\n\n709\n00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:20,520\nSome of them should not be in there and\nthey don't have a pass to get in.\n\n710\n00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,610\nAnd that's what our users have to\nbe aware of, is they have to look\n\n711\n00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,220\nbehind them when they're walking\nin through these doorways and\n\n712\n00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,990\nthese access points that are controlled.\n\n713\n00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,320\nMaking sure that nobody is\nslipping in behind them, or\n\n714\n00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,680\nif there is people behind them\nthat they know who they are.\n\n715\n00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,220\nAnd there's nothing wrong with turning\naround and saying hi can I help you?\n\n716\n00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,920\nYou know because that's one,\neither going to spook the person and\n\n717\n00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,190\nthey're going to run off.\n\n718\n00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,918\nOr you can take them to the front desk and\nsay okay, this person's looking for Bob,\n\n719\n00:31:44,918 --> 00:31:47,165\nyou've got a meeting at two and\nleave them there.\n\n720\n00:31:47,165 --> 00:31:51,000\nDon't just, huh I wonder who that was,\nand let them walk in behind you.\n\n721\n00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,350\n>> Social engineered tailgating attacks,\nwhere that guy, he dresses up and\n\n722\n00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,690\nit looks like a utility

second let me hold that door for you.\n\n725\n00:32:01,414 --> 00:32:02,465\n>> I'll get that door for you.\n\n726\n00:32:02,465 --> 00:32:04,618\n>> And then personally owned

information\non there, if I'm working with\n\n729\n00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:16,705\nwork documents on those devices We need\nto teach our users how to protect those\n\n730\n00:32:16,705 --> 00:32:21,030\ndevices and how to enable remote wipe\ncapabilities on these types of devices.\n\n731\n00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:24,240\nBecause they are easy to lose, easy to lay\nlaying around and somebody picks them up,\n\n732\n00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,080\nyou leave them in the back of a cab,\non a restaurant table somewhere.\n\n733\n00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,260\nSo we've got to make sure that\nwe're teaching our users that\n\n734\n00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,870\neven though that's your personal\ndevice if you're working with it,\n\n735\n00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,460\nif it's gonna be used in my network,\nit has to be approved and\n\n736\n00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,590\nit has to be configured to connect\nto the network in a secure fashion,\n\n737\n00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:46,410\nand it has to be set up for remote wipe,\nand it has to locked, right?\n\n738\n00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:46,960\n>> That's right.\n\n739\n00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,260\n>> My folks work for\nUniversity of

didn't have the passcode enabled\n\n742\n00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,130\nthen they weren't allowed\nto connect to the network.\n\n743\n00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:00,970\n>> Really,

good unless you got\nanything else to throw in there.\n\n747\n00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,330\n>> Nope, not at all.\n\n748\n00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,652\n>> That is probably a good point for\nus to

00:33:30,240\nWe left off just finished\ntalking about user habits and\n\n754\n00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,920\nhow we really need to try to\ningrain into our users that one,\n\n755\n00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,130\nthat they're part of security and\nbest practices.\n\n756\n00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,560\nTeaching them things like how\nto create good strong passwords,\n\n757\n00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:46,140\nhow to go about data handling, keeping\na clean desk, preventing tailgating, and\n\n758\n00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,830\nthings like that, personally owned\ndevices, and how to make sure that\n\n759\n00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:53,240\nthey have to be approved and connected\nto the network in the appropriate way.\n\n760\n00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,940\nRemote wipes turned on and\nlocks turned on, and all that good stuff.\n\n761\n00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,770\nNext thing we're gonna talk about is again\ncontinue on with user education, and\n\n762\n00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:11,470\nwe need to make sure that our users are\naware of new things that are coming out.\n\n763\n00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,895\nAnd that they've got\ngood factual information.\n\n764\n00:34:13,895 --> 00:34:14,560\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n765\n00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,470\n>> I think is a big part of it.\n\n766\n00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:22,480\nYou know we can lose a lot of\nproductivity out of our

too.\n\n769\n00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:34,050\n>> If a user thinks they're, they need.\n\n770\n00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,470\n>> I can't think of a way to put it.\n\n771\n00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,430\nI want to make sure that my users,\n\n772\n00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:41,850\nif they feel like their device has been\ncompromised or something like that,\n\n773\n00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:45,810\nthat they could verify or they have some\nway of checking to see if they're correct.\n\n774\n00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,840\nOr just being made aware of new\nthreats that are out there.\n\n775\n00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,950\nAnd I want them to know that hey,\n\n776\n00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:53,070\nthere is a new bug going around\nwhere you're gonna get an email and\n\n777\n00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:58,590\nit's gonna say click here to update your\npassword for access to the SQL database.\n\n778\n00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,920\nI need to make them aware of that.\n\n779\n00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,860\nSo when they get that email\nthey're not seeing it for\n\n780\n00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,280\nthe first time going,\nis this legit or not?\n\n781\n00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,670\nShould I click on it or not?\n\n782\n00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:10,760\nSo I need to make sure that I have some\nway of informing them about new attacks\n\n783\n00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:14,140\nthat are coming out, new policies\nthat we might be putting into place,\n\n784\n00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:19,350\nnew threats that our\ncompany might be facing.\n\n785\n00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:24,130\n>> I think of Hartleap just\nan awareness in general on Hartleap\n\n786\n00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:29,070\ncould probably stopped a lot of\nthe spread of that Red SMART.\n\n787\n00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:33,690\n>> Yeah, and that is a very common thing\nnowadays and you're seeing more and more.\n\n788\n00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,300\nI know several people that\nhave fallen victim to that.\n\n789\n00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,600\nI even know a couple people\nthat have sent the money order.\n\n790\n00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,110\n>> Oh yeah, sure.\n\n791\n00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:44,390\nI've actually paid $300 to get\nthe FBI off their computer.\n\n792\n00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:48,415\nAnd then call me going, I paid them the\nmoney, and my computer's still locked out.\n\n793\n00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:49,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n794\n00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,270\n>> Okay, first let's clean up your\ncomputer, and then I'll explain to\n\n795\n00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:55,020\nyou how you just bought some kid\nin Russia a brand new X-box.\n\n796\n00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,820\n>> Yes, yep.\n\n797\n00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,740\n>> But people are just,\nagain, lack of education.\n\n798\n00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,620\n>> Yep.\n>> They don't know any better.\n\n799\n00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,210\nThey think they're doing the right\nthing and they just don't know.\n\n800\n00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,620\nSo it really comes to educating and\n\n801\n00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,420\nthere's a bunch of ways we can do that,\nright?\n\n802\n00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:14,350\nOne of my favorites, I think all companies\nshould maintain a company intra-net\n\n803\n00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,870\nsite where we can post security bulletins.\n\n804\n00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,090\nAnd things like that.\n\n805\n00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:23,060\nSo as IT guys, we're gonna know when those\nnew threats are coming out, we're gonna be\n\n806\n00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:27,020\nsigned up to get emails from different\nvendors and things like that.\n\n807\n00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,120\nAnd we can make that\navailable to our users.\n\n808\n00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,307\nAnd you can say here's a new threat\nthat's out or here is a new way that they\n\n809\n00:36:32,307 --> 00:36:36,270\nare trying to trick you into giving away\npersonal information and things like that.\n\n810\n00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,350\nAnd if my users could go\nto that website now and\n\n811\n00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:43,640\nagain and look at that information, it's\ngonna make my network a more secure place.\n\n812\n00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,680\n>> Definitely.\nI had a friend,\n\n813\n00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,880\nyou know they call out here\nabout the new threats and\n\n814\n00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,740\nnew securities under these objectives.\n\n815\n00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,780\nThey talk about new Phishing attacks.\n\n816\n00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,820\nWell, Phishing attacks really aren't new,\n\n817\n00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,870\nbut they are constantly coming\nup with ways to trick people.\n\n818\n00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:01,390\nAnd it works, if it didn't work we\nwouldn't have to worry about them.\n\n819\n00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:05,673\nI had a friend that put,\nhe had a motorcycle at the time, and\n\n820\n00:37:05,673 --> 00:37:07,820\nhe put it up on Craigslist.\n\n821\n00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,260\nThis isn't anything bad about Craigslist.\n\n822\n00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:14,790\nBut he puts it up on Craigslist, and\nhe gets this email and the guy says, well,\n\n823\n00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:18,380\nwe'll give you $1,600 or\nwhatever it was and he goes, but\n\n824\n00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,120\nbefore you do that, we have a custom\ncharge that we need to take care of.\n\n825\n00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,670\nCould you mail us the $200 and then we'll\nwire the $1200 back into your account.\n\n826\n00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,330\nSo something like that and\n\n827\n00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,610\nunfortunately he wired out two hundred\ndollars thinking that it was legit.\n\n828\n00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:34,930\nAnd again some of us out there would say,\nreally he fell for that?\n\n829\n00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:38,530\nBut people do, like I said we wouldn't\nhave to worry about these attacks if they\n\n830\n00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,570\nweren't successful.\n\n831\n00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,910\nBut they are successful enough,\nand they happen enough,\n\n832\n00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:48,590\nwhere you get that one email from\nthat your long-lost relative out of\n\n833\n00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:52,510\na third-world country that just inherited\na gazillion dollars and would love to give\n\n834\n00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:57,070\nyou the first 2 million as long as you\ngive them your bank account information.\n\n835\n00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:59,989\nThen they wipe out your bank account.\n\n836\n00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:01,410\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n837\n00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,460\nI tell you, and\nwe can maintain an internal site.\n\n838\n00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,110\nAgain, I think it's a great idea.\n\n839\n00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,900\nThere's a lot of sites that are out\nthere in the public, you know,\n\n840\n00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,610\nthat are public to maintain, that we can\nmake sure my users are aware of, you know,\n\n841\n00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,620\ngive them bookmarks to these places and\nall.\n\n842\n00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:16,420\nThough a couple you can see a few of\nthem on my screen here and there's many,\n\n843\n00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,440\nmany more like Hoaxbusters.\n\n844\n00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,770\nThat's a great one to have your users\nhave so that they can go out and if\n\n845\n00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:26,590\nsomebody tells them, hey this is going on\nif you click this, this is gonna happen.\n\n846\n00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,240\nThey can go verify that right?\n\n847\n00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,470\nAnd it works for non-security things too.\n\n848\n00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:36,080\nLike my dad will send me picture of a dude\nwith the biggest alligator ever caught and\n\n849\n00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,810\nit's like four times\nthe length of his truck.\n\n850\n00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:41,750\nYou go to Mythbusters or\nHoaxbusters or some place like this,\n\n851\n00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,960\nand you can see, okay this is a photo\nthat's been going around the internet and\n\n852\n00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,220\npeople you know, it's been\nphotoshopped and blah, blah, blah.\n\n853\n00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,810\nBut it's the same thing with bugs and\nviruses and things like that.\n\n854\n00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:55,120\nThey can come here, they can look things\nup, they can do searches for them.\n\n855\n00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:59,100\nYou got other sites that\nare a little more security related.\n\n856\n00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:04,610\nSuch as one of my favorites here,\nsecurityfocus is a good one.\n\n857\n00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,920\nSnopes, hoaxbusters.\n\n858\n00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,160\n>> I like Snopes I've seen that\nup there I like that one [LAUGH].\n\n859\n00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,190\n>> And that's one that does\nmore than just IT security,\n\n860\n00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,960\nthat will do a lot of different things.\n\n861\n00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,330\n>> Like urban legends and stuff.\n\n862\n00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,117\n>> Yeah.\n>> Not so much security related,\n\n863\n00:39:17,117 --> 00:39:17,700\non that one.\n\n864\n00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,950\n>> Exactly.\n>> Still fun, though.\n\n865\n00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,050\n>> But still a good one.\n\n866\n00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,200\nAnd this one is SecurityFocus,\n\n867\n00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,160\nwhich is, unfortunately Semantic\nhas kind of taken this over.\n\n868\n00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,900\nBut you come in here and you can see some\nnew vulnerabilities that are coming out,\n\n869\n00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,460\nget information on them.\n\n870\n00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,790\nAnd this is what I really like, you can\njump in here and get a mailing list.\n\n871\n00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:37,210\nAnd then you subscribe to these sites so\nthat you don't have to go over here and\n\n872\n00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,830\ncheck every day, they'll email you.\n\n873\n00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,070\nYou know, you can pick all\nthese different categories,\n\n874\n00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:45,160\nfocus on Apple, focus on Microsoft,\nForensics or what have you.\n\n875\n00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,700\nAnd you can get emailed when new links\nget posted in these different categories.\n\n876\n00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:53,990\nAgain, to help you keep on top because\nsecurity is a fast changing field.\n\n877\n00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:57,610\nAnd we've got to make sure we are staying\nin touch and then we can in turn\n\n878\n00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:01,410\nfilter through this information, and\nthen post on those company intranet sites.\n\n879\n00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,870\n>> Get some of the jargon out there.\n\n880\n00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,540\nBring it in something\nan end user understands.\n\n881\n00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,805\nYou start talking about different types\nof malware, and why you shouldn't do it.\n\n882\n00:40:08,805 --> 00:40:10,273\nIt can install a rootkit, and\n\n883\n00:40:10,273 --> 00:40:12,926\nthey just glass over like\nwhat are you talking about?\n\n884\n00:40:12,926 --> 00:40:13,500\n>> Exactly.\n\n885\n00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,152\nThey need to be aware Some of\nthe different scams that are going on in\n\n886\n00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:21,851\nemails, but they don't need to be aware of\none of the latest DNS vulnerabilities that\n\n887\n00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:23,170\nwe are facing, right?\n\n888\n00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,026\n>> Sure.\n>> So we can filter through that\n\n889\n00:40:25,026 --> 00:40:28,725\ninformation and get it towards\nsomething that the end user needs.\n\n890\n00:40:28,725 --> 00:40:31,644\nAnother good one is Oracle has\ntheir new What's New page.\n\n891\n00:40:31,644 --> 00:40:33,538\nI'll click and open that one for you.\n\n892\n00:40:33,538 --> 00:40:37,735\nAnd also, these notes will be on our site\nright underneath the video when you go to\n\n893\n00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:38,680\nwatch it.\n\n894\n00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,738\nAnd you guys will have\nall these links as well.\n\n895\n00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:45,490\nThere's Oracles there's their page!\n\n896\n00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:48,920\nAnd you know they've got this, What's New-\n>> Mm-Hm\n\n897\n00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,250\n>> So again, we can see some things that\n\n898\n00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:50,990\nare coming out.\n\n899\n00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,420\nSee if I find anything interesting.\n\n900\n00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,460\nNothing good right now.\n\n901\n00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,040\n>> No, they haven't found you out yet.\n\n902\n00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,760\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n903\n00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:02,200\nSo, again, there's the most\ncritical patch update advisory.\n\n904\n00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,500\nSo, they might talk about a new\npatch that Windows has put out or\n\n905\n00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,920\nApple has put out for\ntheir products or something so.\n\n906\n00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,170\nPublic vulnerabilities, things like that.\n\n907\n00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,000\nAnother good page to take a look at.\n\n908\n00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,380\nThere's our list of updates.\n\n909\n00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,760\nJava updates.\n\n910\n00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,100\n>> Java updates every other week.\n\n911\n00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,570\n>> Mm-hm. Yep. >> So\nanother good link too,\n\n912\n00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:25,585\nif you're going to get into the field of\nsecurity or security is part of your job.\n\n913\n00:41:25,585 --> 00:41:28,820\nThen, these are some of the places that\nyou're gonna become familiar with,\n\n914\n00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,530\nbecause you're going\nto visit these places.\n\n915\n00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,610\n>> Fall, that's great.\n\n916\n00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:33,200\n>> It is.\n\n917\n00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,300\nSo we've used it on over\nthree billion devices.\n\n918\n00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,480\nYeah, not on many of my devices.\n\n919\n00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,010\n>> That's a pretty big attack service.\n\n920\n00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:43,610\n>> And it really is and you know\nwe don't need it for much anymore.\n\n921\n00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,740\nYeah, yeah.\nWell, you know,\n\n922\n00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,010\nwe've got to play pocket elves.\n\n923\n00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:52,470\nThe whole point of all that\nis just again user education.\n\n924\n00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,840\nThey're not going to go these sites to and\nread this information.\n\n925\n00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,920\nIt's going to go right over their head.\n\n926\n00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,430\nWe've got to find this information.\n\n927\n00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:00,550\nWe've got to make it\navailable to my end users.\n\n928\n00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:05,118\nBecause in the end, if I can educate them,\nI can keep my network safe or\n\n929\n00:42:05,118 --> 00:42:09,547\nsafer and that's going to be less\nwork on me in the long run, right?\n\n930\n00:42:09,547 --> 00:42:11,960\nSo that's what I want to try to do.\n\n931\n00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,490\nSocial networking and\npeer to peer, p to p.\n\n932\n00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:17,660\nAnother i manger.\n\n933\n00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,230\nSo, their i manager is based on java?\n\n934\n00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:23,200\n>> Nice.\n>> I haven't worked with Novell in years.\n\n935\n00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,130\nI mean, it's been a long time since\nI've set up any e directory or\n\n936\n00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:26,800\nanything with Novell.\n\n937\n00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,680\n>> I didn't even know\nthe company still existed.\n\n938\n00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,030\n>> Yeah.\nThey kind of dropped off.\n\n939\n00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,930\nTheir support just kind of petered out.\n\n940\n00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,890\nAnyway, social networking and\npeer to peer,\n\n941\n00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:39,240\nwe've mentioned a little bit about\nthis kind of thing the other day.\n\n942\n00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,700\nIt's just that the support is.\n\n943\n00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,180\nAnd I think that's one of the big reasons\nyou don't see much of them anymore is\n\n944\n00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:45,940\nyou could call them up.\n\n945\n00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,020\nYou couldn't get any help for them.\n\n946\n00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:49,100\nYou couldn't even get\nthem to answer the phone.\n\n947\n00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,560\nAnd so, who's gonna buy that?\n\n948\n00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:55,660\nHopefully, they'll get their stuff\ntogether and straighten it all out.\n\n949\n00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:59,416\nBut social networking and\npeer to peer it's huge nowadays, right?\n\n950\n00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:05,010\nIt's everywhere you go, every page,\nevery company has a Facebook page,\n\n951\n00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,880\nand a Twitter feed, and a-\n>>

our users are using it all the time.\n\n955\n00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,480\nIn fact, I bet you if we switch\nto the live, the wide screen,\n\n956\n00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,270\nJason might even have Facebook pulled\nup on his other monitor over there.\n\n957\n00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:24,165\nIt is not going to do it.\n\n958\n00:43:24,165 --> 00:43:24,940\n[Laughs.]\n>> So.\n\n959\n00:43:24,940 -->

--> 00:48:58,628\nWe've got this portion of the policy.\n\n1091\n00:48:58,628 --> 00:49:00,410\n>> Mm-hm, right, yeah.\n>> Is user x, y, and z,\n\n1092\n00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:02,960\nhave they,\nare they even aware of the policy?\n\n1093\n00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,960\nHave they seen it?\n\n1094\n00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,110\nWas it part of their formal\ntraining when they started here?\n\n1095\n00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:11,110\nWhen's the last time you've\never looked at what you needed\n\n1096\n00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:14,350\nto pass your driver's license test?\n\n1097\n00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:15,000\n>> Right, yeah.\n\n1098\n00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,894\nNever.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n1099\n00:49:17,894 --> 00:49:18,394\n>> Right?\n\n1100\n00:49:18,394 --> 00:49:19,324\nI haven't but we can't treat it\n\n1101\n00:49:19,324 --> 00:49:19,841\nlike that right,\n\n1102\n00:49:19,841 --> 00:49:21,095\nwe don't get that one size fits all.\n>> Yep.\n\n1103\n00:49:21,095 --> 00:49:21,765\n>> And\n\n1104\n00:49:21,765 --> 00:49:25,415\nwe always got to keep going back and\nreviewing the policy and\n\n1105\n00:49:25,415 --> 00:49:28,100\nthen making sure that the policy meets\nthe current demands of the company too.\n\n1106\n00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,815\n>> Absolutely.\nNow you might find that we spend a lot of\n\n1107\n00:49:30,815 --> 00:49:34,050\nmoney on having these posters created.\n\n1108\n00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:38,200\nAnd they don't seem to have as much effect\n\n1109\n00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,812\nas that lunch-and-learn that\nwe spent half the money on.\n\n1110\n00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:42,070\n>> Mm-hm\n>> Man, you put pizza and\n\n1111\n00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:44,030\ncoke in their hands and,\nand they're all yours.\n\n1112\n00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:46,820\nCaptive audience and they, or may that\njust, maybe they don't retain anything.\n\n1113\n00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:47,510\n>> You got my attention.\n\n1114\n00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:48,850\n>> Right, I know so-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1115\n00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:51,810\n>> You need to evaluate what you're doing\n\n1116\n00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:52,800\nto train your employees.\n\n1117\n00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,180\nWhat methods you're using.\n\n1118\n00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,820\nAnd then determine which ones are working,\nwhich ones aren't working,\n\n1119\n00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,550\nwhich ones I can make better.\n\n1120\n00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:01,450\nOr maybe we want to try some\ndifferent tricks and techniques.\n\n1121\n00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:02,800\nAnd we've mentioned SANS.\n\n1122\n00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,888\nI'm gonna pull up a link real quick here,\nJason.\n\n1123\n00:50:04,888 --> 00:50:10,750\nSANS.org is a great site,\nthey have a lot of stuff.\n\n1124\n00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,945\nLike yesterday,\nwhen we were talking about policies.\n\n1125\n00:50:12,945 --> 00:50:15,000\n>> Mm-hm?\n>> If you ever need to make a policy\n\n1126\n00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,710\nof any kind-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1127\n00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:18,250\n>> An acceptable use policy,\na privacy policy, whatever,\n\n1128\n00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:21,160\nand you don't know where to start,\nSANS is where you want to go.\n\n1129\n00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,850\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n>> They have templates that\n\n1130\n00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:27,250\nare freely available that you can get that\nhave like, put your company name here.\n\n1131\n00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,920\n>> Right, and they tell you to do that.\n\n1132\n00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:34,130\n>> Yes, absolutely, or you can just kind\nof start with theirs and make your own.\n\n1133\n00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:36,580\nThey have a bunch of great information.\n\n1134\n00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,350\n>> And free, by the way.\n\n1135\n00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:38,920\n>> All free.\n\n1136\n00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,110\n>> It's freely distributed.\n\n1137\n00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,680\n>> Exactly.\n>> So it's not something you have to worry\n\n1138\n00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,380\nabout if you download one\nof these templates and\n\n1139\n00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,150\nyou modify it to suit your needs.\n\n1140\n00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:48,150\nNeeds of your company that you have to\nworry about SANS is gonna come out and\n\n1141\n00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:48,890\nhunt you down.\n\n1142\n00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:49,520\n>> Exactly.\n\n1143\n00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,420\nThat's what they're for.\n\n1144\n00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,540\nSANS.org is there for us.\n\n1145\n00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:55,660\nAnd this is something that I wasn't even\naware that they had until a couple of\n\n1146\n00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:58,010\nweeks ago was this security\nawareness metrics.\n\n1147\n00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:58,890\n>> Interesting.\n>> They actually give\n\n1148\n00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:03,160\nus some stuff that we can use to try\nto see whether or not, where we're at?\n\n1149\n00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,290\nWhat is our current security posture?\n\n1150\n00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:07,260\nAnd, are my methods working?\n\n1151\n00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,960\nSo, I've already downloaded\na couple of these, but\n\n1152\n00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,350\nI wanted to show you the page,\ngive you the link.\n\n1153\n00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:15,380\nThey got this Metrix Matrix,\nwhich I kind of like that name, for\n\n1154\n00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:18,050\nmeasuring your security awareness program.\n\n1155\n00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:21,300\nThey've got this measuring\nhuman risk survey.\n\n1156\n00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,670\nAnd then I did not get this one, but\n\n1157\n00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:26,370\nthere's a phishing assessment,\neffective ways not only to measure but\n\n1158\n00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:29,010\nreinforce the impact of your\nsecurity awareness training.\n\n1159\n00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:31,010\nAnd so if I take a peek at one of these.\n\n1160\n00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,990\nHere, where did I stick that guy?\n\n1161\n00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:36,920\n>> Always download to the desktop.\n\n1162\n00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,630\n>> I know, right?\nI'm showing you guys all my stuff here.\n\n1163\n00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:41,420\nWhere did I put it?\n\n1164\n00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,040\nNo.\n\n1165\n00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,995\nI swear, there's nothing too\nbad on here I don't think.\n\n1166\n00:51:46,995 --> 00:51:51,811\n[SOUND] And here's that metric matrix.\n\n1167\n00:51:51,811 --> 00:51:56,056\n[SOUND] And I got a couple tabs\nlike measuring impact, and\n\n1168\n00:51:56,056 --> 00:52:00,226\nit talks about things like,\nwhat's the metric name?\n\n1169\n00:52:00,226 --> 00:52:01,290\nPhishing awareness.\n\n1170\n00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:03,550\nWho is measured or what is measured?\n\n1171\n00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:06,390\nNumber of people who fall\nvictim to a phishing attack.\n\n1172\n00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:07,220\nHow it's measured?\n\n1173\n00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:10,100\nThrough that phishing assessment,\nwhich was that other download.\n\n1174\n00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:10,930\nWhen it's measured?\n\n1175\n00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:11,610\nMonthly.\n\n1176\n00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:12,200\nWho measured?\n\n1177\n00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,460\nThe security team.\n\n1178\n00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:18,390\nDetails, these attacks replicate\nthe very same one Cyber Attack is using.\n\n1179\n00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:21,360\nThe goal is to measure who\nfalls victim to such attacks.\n\n1180\n00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,240\nNumbers should decrease over\ntime as behavior changes.\n\n1181\n00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,890\nSo they're giving us that little phishing\nthing that I can use that kind of\n\n1182\n00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:30,630\nsimulates or\nwould basically a pop quiz whether or\n\n1183\n00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:32,130\nnot would they click on\nthat link in that email.\n\n1184\n00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:34,790\n>> And I like that there's not\na lot of technical jargon in that.\n\n1185\n00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:36,310\n>> No.\n>> They're not mentioning all this\n\n1186\n00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:38,490\nstuff that a user can't just read and say.\n\n1187\n00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:39,710\nYeah, I think I can understand that.\n\n1188\n00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:40,640\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n1189\n00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,825\nSo these are some of the metrics that we\nmight use at the end after our training.\n\n1190\n00:52:43,825 --> 00:52:45,220\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then they have,\n\n1191\n00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:48,870\nthe other one was a little\nquiz that I liked here.\n\n1192\n00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:50,310\nLet's see, Human Risk Survey.\n\n1193\n00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:55,210\nIf I can get Office to open up.\n\n1194\n00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:58,358\nI probably should have opened\nit up before we started here.\n\n1195\n00:52:58,358 --> 00:53:00,090\nI'm not gonna read all this to you or\nanything like that, but\n\n1196\n00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:03,132\nyou get down to here and this is something\nthat I would pass out to my users.\n\n1197\n00:53:03,132 --> 00:53:06,387\nAnd I've questions like, have you ever\nbeen directly involved in a security\n\n1198\n00:53:06,387 --> 00:53:10,060\nincident with a computer [NOISE] Yes, no,\nI don't know, or I'm not sure, all right?\n\n1199\n00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,900\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1200\n00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,550\n>> What's another one here?\n\n1201\n00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:17,510\nIf you were to suspect that your compter,\nsmartphone or other device\n\n1202\n00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:21,700\nwere involved in a security incident such\nas a virus attack or a hacker attack or\n\n1203\n00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:25,650\nsome other problem, how confident do you\nfeel that you know how to respond to and\n\n1204\n00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:26,900\nreport of the situation?\n\n1205\n00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:27,450\n>> Very nice.\n\n1206\n00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:29,400\n>> And then down below it's\nlike what would you do?\n\n1207\n00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,670\nTell your manager, tell your coworkers.\n\n1208\n00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:36,450\nContact IT, contact the help desk, and\nso through the results of this survey,\n\n1209\n00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:38,650\nI know where I need to now\nfocus my training, right?\n\n1210\n00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,970\n>> Yeah right.\n>> And my word is holy smokes.\n\n1211\n00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,750\nHalf my employees said they\nwould tell their coworkers.\n\n1212\n00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:44,288\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n>> No way,\n\n1213\n00:53:44,288 --> 00:53:47,645\nthat's not what we want you to do if\nyou think your device has been involved\n\n1214\n00:53:47,645 --> 00:53:48,725\nin a breach.\n\n1215\n00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,425\nBut I didn't know that's what they, but\n\n1216\n00:53:50,425 --> 00:53:52,905\nnow this survey lets me\nfind that information out.\n\n1217\n00:53:52,905 --> 00:53:54,835\n>> Can you bring up another one there,\nNIST?\n\n1218\n00:53:54,835 --> 00:53:57,160\nNational Institute of\nStandards in Technology.\n\n1219\n00:53:57,160

00:54:03,805\nI was thinking of-\n>> Is it an org?\n\n1222\n00:54:03,805 --> 00:54:05,525\n>> You just type it in Google.\n\n1223\n00:54:05,525 --> 00:54:06,686\nI believe it's just NIST.\n\n1224\n00:54:09,435 --> 00:54:10,197\n[SOUND]\n>> And\n\n1225\n00:54:10,197 --> 00:54:12,162\nit should be the first one\nthat comes up in the list,\n\n1226\n00:54:12,162 -->

then they've got an information\n\n1229\n00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:19,680\ntechnology there.\n\n1230\n00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,580\nAnd then within there I believe they\nhave a cyber-security framework.\n\n1231\n00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:23,646\nYeah, there you go, right at the top.\n\n1232\n00:54:23,646 --> 00:54:27,138\nCyber-security framework.\n\n1233\n00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:29,480\nAnd again, no, we're not gonna subscribe.\n\n1234\n00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,670\n>> Right.\n>> Then again,\n\n1235\n00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:34,390\nthey say framework for\nimproving critical

users,\n\n1238\n00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,276\nnot as user friendly as\nthat last one would be.\n\n1239\n00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:41,770\n>> Absolutely.\n>> But this is another one for us,\n\n1240\n00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:44,660\nlike you said, and then we have\nto filter out some of the jargon.\n\n1241\n00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:47,435\n[CROSSTALK] But\nthey have a lot of stuff in here too.\n\n1242\n00:54:47,435 --> 00:54:51,309\nAnd they do all kinds of standards you can\nsee, not just the electrical sciences,\n\n1243\n00:54:51,309 --> 00:54:52,730\nnuclear sciences and stuff.\n\n1244\n00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:56,570\nBut they do have a specific section in\nhere for just information technology and\n\n1245\n00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:57,400\ncyber security.\n\n1246\n00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:57,900\n>> Right.\n\n1247\n00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,670\n>> It's a good thing,\na good platform for you to have as well.\n\n1248\n00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:03,610\nSo you can establish what\nit is in the company.\n\n1249\n00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:07,540\nMaybe you're not aware of\nthe different components.\n\n1250\n00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,580\nWell this can help you out as well.\n\n1251\n00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,905\n>> Right, very good, very good.\n\n1252\n00:55:09,905 --> 00:55:12,730\nYeah, you really can't have\ntoo many resources available.\n\n1253\n00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:14,910\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's good to have all\n\n1254\n00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:17,992\nof these different,\nyou're gonna develop your own over time.\n\n1255\n00:55:17,992 --> 00:55:21,590\nYou're gonna have your favorite ones that\nyou go to and that you used more often.\n\n1256\n00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:23,872\nExcuse me.\n\n1257\n00:55:23,872 --> 00:55:27,940\nAll right, well I'll tell you what,\nthat pretty much covers.\n\n1258\n00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:31,760\nJust the thing I forgot to turn out, we\nhad one of our users through in a comment\n\n1259\n00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,155\nthe other day, it's like can you put\nsome way to tell where you're clicking.\n\n1260\n00:55:36,155 --> 00:55:38,255\nYou guys click a little\ntoo fast sometimes, and\n\n1261\n00:55:38,255 --> 00:55:40,585\nI can't tell how you pulled\nup that dialogue box.\n\n1262\n00:55:40,585 --> 00:55:41,735\nI meant to turn that on where you can\n\n1263\n00:55:41,735 --> 00:55:42,655\nmake the-\n>> The control.\n\n1264\n00:55:42,655 --> 00:55:45,695\n>> Yeah where you can make the little\nsonar ring go off around your mouse.\n\n1265\n00:55:45,695 --> 00:55:46,215\n>> Yes.\n\n1266\n00:55:46,215 --> 00:55:48,660\n>> So\nI will remember to do that next time.\n\n1267\n00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:52,250\nBut anyway, anything else you wanna\nadd before we take a little break?\n\n1268\n00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,462\n>> Nope.\nGot a blue shirt on today,\n\n1269\n00:55:53,462 --> 00:55:54,225\nthat's about all I got.\n\n1270\n00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:58,627\n>> All right then we are gonna step away\nfor a minute and refill some waters and\n\n1271\n00:55:58,627 --> 00:56:02,177\nwhen we come back,\nwe're gonna pick up with topic 2.7,\n\n1272\n00:56:02,177 --> 00:56:06,450\ncompare and contrast physical security and\nenvironmental controls.\n\n1273\n00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:08,087\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n1274\n00:56:08,087 --> 00:56:14,611\n[MUSIC]\n\n1275\n00:56:14,611 --> 00:56:17,898\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen to our SYA,\n\n1276\n00:56:17,898 --> 00:56:19,248\nI almost said it again.\n\n1277\n00:56:19,248 --> 00:56:20,983\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> SYA0401,\n\n1278\n00:56:20,983 --> 00:56:26,997\nour Security Plus objectives and we\nare getting ready to hit topic 2.7, right.\n\n1279\n00:56:26,997 --> 00:56:27,767\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n1280\n00:56:27,767 --> 00:56:31,170\n>> 2.7, compare and contrast\n>> Physical security and\n\n1281\n00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:33,690\nenvironmental controls.\n\n1282\n00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,390\nAll right, good stuff here.\n\n1283\n00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:36,890\nNot the most exciting maybe.\n\n1284\n00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:40,230\nAnd a lot, like I said at the beginning\nof this episode I think, this is a little\n\n1285\n00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,170\nlighter on the brain than some of\nthe stuff we were doing the other day.\n\n1286\n00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:44,740\nBut still important stuff, nonetheless.\n\n1287\n00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:48,270\nSo, First let's talk about some\nof these environmental controls.\n\n1288\n00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:50,000\nHVAC, what the heck is that?\n\n1289\n00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,250\nI have no idea.\n\n1290\n00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:51,810\n>> HVAC.\n\n1291\n00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:52,388\n>> Yeah, HVAC.\n\n1292\n00:56:52,388 --> 00:56:56,920\n>> Wreak havoc [LAUGH]\n>> That's heating, ventilation, and AC.\n\n1293\n00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,850\nClimate control systems.\n\n1294\n00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:03,300\nWe have to keep server closets and\ndata centers At a certain humidity,\n\n1295\n00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,678\nlike a relative humidity.\n\n1296\n00:57:04,678 --> 00:57:05,213\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1297\n00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:09,230\n>> I've seen people quote 50%\nto 60% relative humidity.\n\n1298\n00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:11,280\nI've heard some people say 40% to 60%.\n\n1299\n00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,000\n>> Yeah.\n>> So,\n\n1300\n00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,900\nremember that anything less than around\n40 to 50 percent relative humidity,\n\n1301\n00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,580\nit leads to, what is it,\na static charge generation?\n\n1302\n00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:20,160\n>> Exactly.\n\n1303\n00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,030\nA lot of people don't think about the.\n\n1304\n00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:22,800\nThe humidity right.\n\n1305\n00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,270\nWe think about the temperature in that\nserver closet which is definitely\n\n1306\n00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:26,790\nimportant.\n\n1307\n00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:30,240\nBut the humidity is too low, and\nyou end up just like in the winter time.\n\n1308\n00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,070\nWhen you are shuffling your\nfeet across the carpet.\n\n1309\n00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:33,700\nYou run up to your buddy and\nyou touch him, right.\n\n1310\n00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,570\nAnd, the zapping.\n\n1311\n00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:38,390\nYou grab that doorknob and you get shocked\nbecause there is no moisture in the air\n\n1312\n00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:39,670\nand the air molecules are.\n\n1313\n00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:43,010\nCreating friction and\nwe're getting that static electricity.\n\n1314\n00:57:43,010 --> 00:57:45,910\nToo high and\nall of a sudden we get condensation.\n\n1315\n00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:48,010\nAs those servers heat up, cool down, or\n\n1316\n00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:51,030\nwhat have you, too much moisture\nin the air leads to condensation.\n\n1317\n00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:53,830\nAnd we all know moisture's\nprobably not good for our systems.\n\n1318\n00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:57,470\n>> Don was mentioning, and he's probably\nmentioned this in other episodes,\n\n1319\n00:57:57,470 --> 00:57:59,510\nthat when they would get a new server.\n\n1320\n00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:03,320\nInto the data center, they would leave it\nin the server closet in the box for two or\n\n1321\n00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:03,935\nthree days.\n\n1322\n00:58:03,935 --> 00:58:05,810\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> To help it just to adjust to\n\n1323\n00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:07,685\nthat climate before ever plugging it in.\n\n1324\n00:58:07,685 --> 00:58:10,640\n>> Yeah,it's almost like you're\ndoing a decompression dive, right?\n\n1325\n00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,460\nYou take that thing off of the UPS truck,\nand\n\n1326\n00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,925\nyou let it sit in the office somewhere.\n\n1327\n00:58:13,925 --> 00:58:15,220\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Because out in the UPS truck,\n\n1328\n00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,010\nit's 110 degrees, 120 degrees, right?\n\n1329\n00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:18,820\n>> Sure.\nNow you're going to bring it in the office\n\n1330\n00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,820\nand let it sit and\nlet it come down to 78, to 75,\n\n1331\n00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:23,520\nwhatever you have your office set to.\n\n1332\n00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,100\nAnd after that,\n\n1333\n00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,160\nthen you can move it in your server\ncloset, bring it down a few more degrees,\n\n1334\n00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,510\nbecause your server closet's running at\n60 or 70 degrees or something like that.\n\n1335\n00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:31,150\n>> Definitely.\n\n1336\n00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:33,700\nThe other thing I was\ngoing to mention too,\n\n1337\n00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:37,410\nis they use air ionizers as well and\nair ionizers.\n\n1338\n00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:40,710\nOne of the good things about\nair ionizers if I can say it\n\n1339\n00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:44,580\nunlike your traditional HAVC access\nsystems is they don't have filters.\n\n1340\n00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:47,770\nNo filters, no molds,\nthe filters start to get clogged up and\n\n1341\n00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:50,990\nthen what really good as\nthe filtration system.\n\n1342\n00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:51,670\n>> Right.\n\n1343\n00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:58,530\n>> So the air ionizers, what they do is\nessentially just force out negative ions.\n\n1344\n00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:01,650\nAll your particles and\ndust are considered positive ions.\n\n1345\n00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:04,420\nReally all it's doing is making those\nparticles heavy enough that they fall to\n\n1346\n00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:08,230\nthe floor and you can clean them up with\ntraditional means, traditional methods.\n\n1347\n00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:13,280\nI used to have one of those silly little\nionic breezes from that one company.\n\n1348\n00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,790\nThey're okay,\ndon't get me wrong they do their job.\n\n1349\n00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:16,980\nSome people love them.\n\n1350\n00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:19,410\nBut same principles,\ngot those metal fins in there and\n\n1351\n00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:22,660\nit's using the charge of\nthe air to move it around.\n\n1352\n00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:25,110\nYou're in a sense, making smog.\n\n1353\n00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:27,800\nYou're making O3 basically out of that.\n\n1354\n00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,380\nBut besides that, you're doing all right.\n\n1355\n00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:31,660\n>> I always thought it was a good\nbusiness model because you can't tell\n\n1356\n00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:32,730\nwhat's happening.\n\n1357\n00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:35,530\nSo, we can just sell you something\nthat you really can't tell if\n\n1358\n00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,330\nanything's happening and\nwe'll charge you a lot of money for it.\n\n1359\n00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:41,310\nAlong the lines, we're going to\nkind of go out of order here.\n\n1360\n00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:44,850\nAlong the lines, HVAC, my heating,\nmy ventilation, my AC1.\n\n1361\n00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:46,910\nYou know, obviously as we said, important.\n\n1362\n00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:50,180\nWe've got to make sure we're monitoring\nthose server closets we've got to maintain\n\n1363\n00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:53,900\na particular temperature in there and\na particular humidity level.\n\n1364\n00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,460\nAnd if we're not monitoring that.\n\n1365\n00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:58,090\nThat temperature, despite and\nwe don't notice it and\n\n1366\n00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:01,820\nwhich is going to cause thermal shutdown\non our servers or other devices in there.\n\n1367\n01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:06,650\nOr worse, they catch fire or they actually\ncause physical damage to themselves if\n\n1368\n01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:08,810\nthey don't shut down properly.\n\n1369\n01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:10,380\nSo we've got to make sure\nwe're monitoring that.\n\n1370\n01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,480\nWe need some type of notification.\n\n1371\n01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,220\nAnd just cause you've got\na thermostat in there or\n\n1372\n01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:16,754\na thermometer that's saying hey\nthe temperature is 90 degrees.\n\n1373\n01:00:16,754 --> 01:00:18,957\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n>> Well if nobody's looking, right?\n\n1374\n01:00:18,957 --> 01:00:19,900\n>> Yep.\n>> I remember this one\n\n1375\n01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:23,210\nbusiness we walked by and\nthey had a thermometer on the wall, and\n\n1376\n01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:26,827\nI walked by and I look in there,\nand the thing's at 98 degrees.\n\n1377\n01:00:26,827 --> 01:00:28,280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know?\n\n1378\n01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,822\nand who know how long it had been there?\n\n1379\n01:00:29,822 --> 01:00:31,630\n>> Yeah.\n>> Cause we had no notification system\n\n1380\n01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:34,195\nbuilt into it, it was just\na thermometer hanging on a wall.\n\n1381\n01:00:34,195 --> 01:00:34,810\n>> Mm-hm\n>> So\n\n1382\n01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:37,490\nyou've gotta make sure that you've got\nmonitoring, and that somebody's paying\n\n1383\n01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:40,840\nattention to it or if you've got some kind\nof notification if it goes out of band or\n\n1384\n01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,740\nout of range that it sends\nsome kind of notification.\n\n1385\n01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:46,010\n>> Especially with moisture\ntrays that are in those things,\n\n1386\n01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:49,820\nyou have a moisture tray and if the\nfiltration system, sometimes you'll see\n\n1387\n01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:54,750\nthat it literally will force any\nexcess water that's in there.\n\n1388\n01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,980\nUp through the ceiling out on to the roof.\n\n1389\n01:00:56,980 --> 01:01:00,860\nBut boy if that doesn't happen you run\nthe risk of having water in your server.\n\n1390\n01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,440\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1391\n01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,430\nI've seen that use those stand\nalone coolers that have those.\n\n1392\n01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:08,350\nAll that moisture's getting pulled\nout of the air, cooling the air.\n\n1393\n01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:09,870\nIt's got a pan down at the bottom.\n\n1394\n01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:13,330\nAnd if that's not hooked up to a drain\nflows right on the floor and stuff.\n\n1395\n01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:17,190\nAnd then right along those same lines,\nI'm going to jump down to,\n\n1396\n01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:20,380\nwe talked really about environmental\nmonitoring and temperature.\n\n1397\n01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:23,480\nReally this is all the same thing,\neverything we're talking about here.\n\n1398\n01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:29,200\nHot and cold aisles, and that's something\nyou see in your larger server closets or\n\n1399\n01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,230\nyour data centers and things like that.\n\n1400\n01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:35,190\nJust pull up a quick pick\nif I can find one here.\n\n1401\n01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:39,500\n>> And while he's doing that,\none of the things you think about hot and\n\n1402\n01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,412\ncold aisles.\n\n1403\n01:01:40,412 --> 01:01:44,262\nIt's really like a strategic\npositioning events.\n\n1404\n01:01:44,262 --> 01:01:46,950\nLike in a data center we\nstrategically place those vents so\n\n1405\n01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:50,600\nwe can move that air up and\ndown those aisles and circulate it.\n\n1406\n01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:55,060\nThrough the data center making\nsure that we accomplish either.\n\n1407\n01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:58,990\nI guess you don't ever\nwant to heat anything up.\n\n1408\n01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:05,300\nIf you heat something up, but cooling the\nwhole entire data center down but doing\n\n1409\n01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:09,650\nit in a way where literally those vents\nwill move that air along the hallways.\n\n1410\n01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:12,470\n>> Let's see if I can find\nwhich one looks, you know,\n\n1411\n01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:14,180\nall of these actually look pretty good.\n\n1412\n01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:16,250\nLet me find one that's large enough here.\n\n1413\n01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:25,687\nSo here you can see what they've got going\nis within the inside this data center you\n\n1414\n01:02:25,687 --> 01:02:30,148\nknow you've got your racks of your servers\nin fact let me find one that's got a few\n\n1415\n01:02:30,148 --> 01:02:31,730\nmore racks here.\n\n1416\n01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:35,730\nAnd so the way you put theses servers in\nthese racks is you don't have them you\n\n1417\n01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:40,200\nmight think you want them all\nfacing the same direction, right?\n\n1418\n01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,710\nTo where all of my servers\nare facing in that one direction.\n\n1419\n01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:44,110\nThat's not what we do.\n\n1420\n01:02:44,110 --> 01:02:46,980\nWhen we look down these aisles,\nman Google is being slow today.\n\n1421\n01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:50,430\nWhen you go down these aisles,\nif I'm walking down this aisle\n\n1422\n01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:52,960\nI look to this side I'm going\nto see the front of my servers.\n\n1423\n01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,900\nI look to this other side I'm going\nto see front of my servers, right?\n\n1424\n01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,590\nSo, the fronts are pointing\nin towards one aisle.\n\n1425\n01:02:57,590 --> 01:03:02,110\nIf I go to the next aisle over,\nI'm going to see the backs of servers.\n\n1426\n01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:05,600\nAnd evidently,\nGoogle is just not wanting to play along.\n\n1427\n01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,440\nSo, what's happening is we have it set up.\n\n1428\n01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,840\nAre you frigging kidding me?\n\n1429\n01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:15,360\nAll right,\nlet's just go back to the beginning.\n\n1430\n01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,770\nLet's see if Google is\nstill playing with us.\n\n1431\n01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:22,270\nSo what's going to happen is we want\nto control the way air is circulating\n\n1432\n01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:23,060\nthrough that room.\n\n1433\n01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:23,710\nIf we do.\n\n1434\n01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:28,010\n>> You can get these pockets, these gaps,\n\n1435\n01:03:28,010 --> 01:03:33,350\nthese concentrated areas of hot air that\njust sits there and don't go anywhere.\n\n1436\n01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:36,340\nAnd it can constantly heat\nup all of the servers, and\n\n1437\n01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:41,130\neven the connection devices, routers if\nyou will, right in that one specific area.\n\n1438\n01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:42,040\nThere you go.\n\n1439\n01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:46,510\n>> Exactly and\nif you go down this aisle, if the front\n\n1440\n01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:51,760\nof the servers is over here and then the\nback of another rack of servers is here.\n\n1441\n01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,750\nYou can take the hot air that's going to\nbe pushed out the back of that server,\n\n1442\n01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:57,151\nit's going right in to the front\nof that next server, right?\n\n1443\n01:03:57,151 --> 01:04:01,324\nSo as I go down my aisles, that first rack\nis pushing all their heat to the next\n\n1444\n01:04:01,324 --> 01:04:03,233\nrack, and it's just vice versa.\n\n1445\n01:04:03,233 --> 01:04:04,686\nBy the time you get to the last rack,\n\n1446\n01:04:04,686 --> 01:04:07,261\nyour temperatures are going to\nbe through the roof down there.\n\n1447\n01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:08,570\nSo you alternate them.\n\n1448\n01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:11,767\nAnd then what happens,\nthis will be the front of my servers,\n\n1449\n01:04:11,767 --> 01:04:16,140\nover here on the far right, this would\nbe the front of another rack over here.\n\n1450\n01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:20,660\nSo that the servers are both\npushing toward the middle there.\n\n1451\n01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:25,050\nAnd then the way they've got the HVAC\nset up is you can see the cold air's\n\n1452\n01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:28,620\nactually going down into the floor and\nthen there's vents in the floor here.\n\n1453\n01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:31,200\nAnd that's allowing that\ncold air to come up\n\n1454\n01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,920\nto the front side of this particular rack.\n\n1455\n01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,630\nThere's no vents here.\n\n1456\n01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:38,740\nAnd then there's vents over here\non the front of this rack and\n\n1457\n01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:40,080\nagain that cold air can come up.\n\n1458\n01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,780\nSo they can suck in nice cold air.\n\n1459\n01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:45,530\nAll the heat comes through,\nthat air gets warmed up and\n\n1460\n01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:48,790\npasses through the back from\nboth racks into this aisle.\n\n1461\n01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:53,050\nAnd then there's vents in the ceiling\nhere where my return is for that AC unit.\n\n1462\n01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:54,720\nSo its pulling that air back.\n\n1463\n01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,930\nSo if Google will play and\nI can actually click back.\n\n1464\n01:04:57,930 --> 01:05:02,700\n>> Yeah, and its kind of like, for you\ngamers out there, you gamers that like to\n\n1465\n01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:07,980\nrun multiple video cards in an SOI or\ncrossfire configuration.\n\n1466\n01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:10,580\nThat you have to also,\nramp up the cooling system,\n\n1467\n01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:13,160\nbecause when we have these adjacent\ncards they heat up and they can\n\n1468\n01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:16,800\nheat the next card up, so this is a much\nlarger scale of almost the same concept.\n\n1469\n01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,680\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1470\n01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:21,840\nSo, pretty cool the way they do\nthat hollow floor down there,\n\n1471\n01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:26,490\nallowing that air to go through, and you\ndefinitely don't mind walking down this\n\n1472\n01:05:26,490 --> 01:05:30,398\naisle, you're not so\nhappy walking down this aisle here.\n\n1473\n01:05:30,398 --> 01:05:30,899\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n1474\n01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,060\nSo in the end as far as\nenvironmental control.\n\n1475\n01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:37,580\nWe didn't talk about fire suppression,\nEMI shielding as well.\n\n1476\n01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:40,470\nSo fire suppression obviously we\nneed something to put out the fire.\n\n1477\n01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:42,440\nI figure sprinklers, right?\n\n1478\n01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,140\nWater.\n\n1479\n01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:43,850\n>> That's right.\n\n1480\n01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:48,040\nWell up until 1994 what we were using for\nvery long time was the halon system and\n\n1481\n01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:51,220\nthe halon systems yeah,\nit's still in use I belive.\n\n1482\n01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:53,950\nI've talked to some of our military\nvets that we've seen before and\n\n1483\n01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,570\nthey say they still use it in aviation and\nstuff like that.\n\n1484\n01:05:56,570 --> 01:06:02,330\nThey have other stuff, something called\nHFC222 and it's just a clean agent.\n\n1485\n01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:08,790\nGet all the jargon out of it, it's a clean\nagent and maybe prolonged exposure,\n\n1486\n01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:13,600\nhuman exposure to it might\ncause a problem but for normal\n\n1487\n01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:18,390\njust fire suppression you don't have to\nworry about any health factors on this.\n\n1488\n01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:19,370\nCause you've gotta think about it.\n\n1489\n01:06:19,370 --> 01:06:22,955\nWe can't use something that just\ndepletes all the oxygen in the room.\n\n1490\n01:06:22,955 --> 01:06:24,380\n>> Um-hm.\n>> Sure, it puts the fire out, but\n\n1491\n01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:25,990\nit also takes care of all the humans too.\n\n1492\n01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:28,500\n>> Right.\nA lot of those rooms you will have\n\n1493\n01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:32,340\nstations set up that have breathing\napparatus, cause that door might lock.\n\n1494\n01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:35,310\nAnd that halon got pumped in and\nit would do just that.\n\n1495\n01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:39,530\nIt bonded with the oxygen, and therefore,\nthe fire couldn't combust anymore.\n\n1496\n01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:43,930\nBut if you happened to be in there,\nyeah, you kinda need oxygen as well.\n\n1497\n01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:47,660\nSo you had to have training on where those\nunits were, where the air masks, you know,\n\n1498\n01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:49,430\nwhere the suits were that you had to don.\n\n1499\n01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:53,490\nMake sure that you've survived through\nthat and it's a little dangerous.\n\n1500\n01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:56,960\n>> It is and that's why today\nthey use clean agent systems.\n\n1501\n01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:01,220\nFor one, leave no residue across\nall the computer equipment and\n\n1502\n01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:04,180\ndon't kill the people that are sitting\nat the computer equipment too.\n\n1503\n01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:05,450\n>> Exactly.\n\n1504\n01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:06,450\nYou got that countdown going.\n\n1505\n01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:10,040\nThe alarm kicks in you better get\nout of there unless that door shuts.\n\n1506\n01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,820\nIt always makes me think of spock.\n\n1507\n01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,037\nThis idea of engine.\n\n1508\n01:07:14,037 --> 01:07:17,810\n>> Hepafloro propane is I think\none of the chemicals they use.\n\n1509\n01:07:17,810 --> 01:07:18,900\nYou don't need to know that for the exam.\n\n1510\n01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:21,420\n>> Right.\nAnd then you've got your EMI\n\n1511\n01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:22,020\nshielding, right?\n\n1512\n01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:23,795\nMy electromagnetic interference.\n\n1513\n01:07:23,795 --> 01:07:24,680\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1514\n01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,565\n>> We see that in different places,\nwith the\n\n1515\n01:07:26,565 --> 01:07:27,170\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1516\n01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:28,590\nWell, I think about,\n\n1517\n01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:33,380\nif you're using copper media, we have to\nworry about electromagnetic interference.\n\n1518\n01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:36,155\nIf it's a radiology department\nat a hospital, maybe.\n\n1519\n01:07:36,155 --> 01:07:37,880\nMm-hm.\n>> They might even go to fiber optics at\n\n1520\n01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:38,450\nthat point.\n\n1521\n01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:40,720\n>> Right.\n>> But electro magnetic shielding again\n\n1522\n01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,425\nkeeping

interference\nshielding is it.\n\n1525\n01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:47,682\n>> Right.\nIt boils down to anything other than\n\n1526\n01:07:47,682 --> 01:07:48,240\nyour data\n>> Yeah.\n\n1527\n01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,150\n>> [LAUGH] You know?\n\n1528\n01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:51,140\nIt gets in the copper based media and\nthis can help.\n\n1529\n01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:53,198\nIt increases the expense

guess keep our signals clean if you want\nto keep the noise out of the copper media.\n\n1533\n01:08:01,675 --> 01:08:03,380\n>> Good old shielded twisted area\n>> Yeah\n\n1534\n01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:03,932\n>> A little more\n\n1535\n01:08:03,932 --> 01:08:04,960\nexpensive,\n>> Mm-hm\n\n1536\n01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,560\n>> But you don't have as much cross\n\n1537\n01:08:06,560 -->

even consider you know,\n\n1540\n01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:14,690\nbecause those cables can\nget a very expensive.\n\n1541\n01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:18,520\nLike they have this\nscreened foil twisted pair.\n\n1542\n01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,060\nAnd it's just double shielding.\n\n1543\n01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:23,460\nYou know you have a shielding around the\nconductor and then around each individual\n\n1544\n01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:27,990\ntwisted pair and it can get so expensive\nthat it might be just as expensive or\n\n1545\n01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:30,420\nmaybe even cheaper to just\nimplement fiberoptics.\n\n1546\n01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:33,094\n>> Just switch over to fiber and then we\ndon't have to worry about [INAUDIBLE]\n\n1547\n01:08:33,094 --> 01:08:33,710\n>> That's right.\n\n1548\n01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:36,870\nThen we get into our physical security.\n\n1549\n01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:41,784\nAnd these are going to be things that\nmost of these you're probably already\n\n1550\n01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:44,760\nfamiliar with like hardware locks.\n\n1551\n01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:48,360\nThe oldest security technique\nwe have probably in existence.\n\n1552\n01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,590\nThe lock and key.\n\n1553\n01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:51,120\n>> Lock and key?\n\n1554\n01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,130\nYeah, I can see that.\n\n1555\n01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:54,600\n>> You look at a hardware lock,\nthat's what it is.\n\n1556\n01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,520\nI guess it's not a form of authentication.\n\n1557\n01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:59,160\nBut if you've got the key,\nyou should be there.\n\n1558\n01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,140\nWell hopefully.\n\n1559\n01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:03,560\n>> If your not an authorized user,\nyour authorized now.\n\n1560\n01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,864\n>> And in fact, I remember one\nof the companies I worked for,\n\n1561\n01:09:05,864 --> 01:09:07,000\nwhen I first started there.\n\n1562\n01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,465\nThey had drive locks.\n\n1563\n01:09:08,465 --> 01:09:13,795\n[CROSSTALK] and\nit looked like a Coke machine lock.\n\n1564\n01:09:13,795 --> 01:09:17,440\nYou can turn it our and\npull it the whole entire drive out there.\n\n1565\n01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,610\nAnd again,\nwe're talking about physical security.\n\n1566\n01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:24,956\nYou talk about electronic key,\nelectronic locks within your\n\n1567\n01:09:24,956 --> 01:09:30,680\ninfrastructure, your server closets,\nyour data centers.\n\n1568\n01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:34,350\nAnd you do want to make sure that\nphysical barriers they talk about here.\n\n1569\n01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:35,230\n>> Right.\n>> I believe they're going to\n\n1570\n01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:39,440\ntalk about physical barriers but you know\nwhen we say physical barrier we are not\n\n1571\n01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:43,560\ntalking about a turn style,\nbe we are talking about literally a door.\n\n1572\n01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:46,020\nTypically data sets need to be secure.\n\n1573\n01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:47,380\nWe don't just leave these wide open.\n\n1574\n01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:50,540\nYou know and that goes back to the whole\npiggy back attack that we talked about\n\n1575\n01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:51,510\nduring the last episode.\n\n1576\n01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:53,000\nOne authentication.\n\n1577\n01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,810\nOne entrance.\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1578\n01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:54,340\nAbsolutely, yeah.\n\n1579\n01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:57,710\nMost places have, many people\nmight have a key to my front door.\n\n1580\n01:09:57,710 --> 01:10:00,950\nNot as people should have a key,\nprobably, to that server closet.\n\n1581\n01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:01,985\n>> Sure.\n>> That second layer.\n\n1582\n01:10:01,985 --> 01:10:03,370\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And also, with hardware,\n\n1583\n01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:05,395\na lot of people are talking\nabout things like laptops.\n\n1584\n01:10:05,395 --> 01:10:06,120\n>> Mm-hm, definitely.\n\n1585\n01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,460\n>> I mentioned the other day,\nyou take a laptop with you traveling.\n\n1586\n01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:09,910\nYou're sitting at that hotel.\n\n1587\n01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:13,780\n>> And my laptop if I,\nnow I've got my it might fit in the safe.\n\n1588\n01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:16,300\nWith that Alienware I had, I mean\nthat wasn't going to fit in the safe.\n\n1589\n01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,060\n>> Right, it barely fit your backpack.\n\n1590\n01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:20,590\n>> It about broke my,\nI brought it with me traveling once.\n\n1591\n01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:21,920\n>> Oh right.\n>> And that was all it took.\n\n1592\n01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,220\n>> Yeah.\n>> By the time I got\n\n1593\n01:10:23,220 --> 01:10:24,510\nthrough the airport it\nwas hurting pretty bad.\n\n1594\n01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:28,110\nBut most laptops will have some\ntype of little pin in the back,\n\n1595\n01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:31,290\na little place where you can\nwrap that cable around, and\n\n1596\n01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:34,860\nyou can secure it to a table, or the leg\nof the bed, or something like that.\n\n1597\n01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:37,160\n>> Legacy locks,\nthey use to call them t-bar locks.\n\n1598\n01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,260\nToday it's really a Kingston lock.\n\n1599\n01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:43,370\nIt's like the bike chain lock, where you\ngot a series of digits, and I'm not sure\n\n1600\n01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:46,650\nif it goes into the power, I don't see\nwhy it would go into the power cord.\n\n1601\n01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:50,900\nBut like they got, and that's all,\nit's just a little locking mechanism.\n\n1602\n01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:54,020\nIt goes into the side of the laptop and\nit's got a combination lock.\n\n1603\n01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:58,560\nAnd it prevents that physically\nstealing that laptop.\n\n1604\n01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,310\nI think you had mentioned,\nwhen we were talking about a year ago or\n\n1605\n01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:05,300\nso, about that guy that was\ngoing into those buildings and\n\n1606\n01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,040\nhe was doing social engineering and\nstealing laptops.\n\n1607\n01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:11,060\n>> Yes. Mm-hm. He was just rolling a cart\ndown through there and picking them up.\n\n1608\n01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:14,480\n>> Sure, and it turned out that the way\nthey caught him is because one of\n\n1609\n01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,810\nthose laptops\n>> He stole the wrong laptop,\n\n1610\n01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:19,000\nhad the LoJack system within it.\n\n1611\n01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,130\nIt had that tracking system,\nwhere we talked about doing remote wipes,\n\n1612\n01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:24,040\nwe talked about remote backups.\n\n1613\n01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:27,050\nWell, it also had in that firmware\nof that laptop, the LoJack system,\n\n1614\n01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:29,820\nthat you guys are probably familiar\nwith in your cars and stuff.\n\n1615\n01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:32,490\nI believe you were saying that the FBI\n\n1616\n01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:35,730\ntracked him right down to where hes was,\nyou know?\n\n1617\n01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:38,400\n>> Yes absolutely\n>> So, again there's other implementations\n\n1618\n01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,610\nof security for these mobile\ndevices that you can do as well.\n\n1619\n01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:43,270\nBut remember, it's just so easy\n>> Mm-hm\n\n1620\n01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:44,650\n>> To grab that device and\n\n1621\n01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:45,845\nwalk out the door.\n\n1622\n01:11:45,845 --> 01:11:47,935\nSo it is important to keep them secure.\n\n1623\n01:11:47,935 --> 01:11:48,545\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1624\n01:11:48,545 --> 01:11:50,267\n>> I would say it was etched to the table.\n\n1625\n01:11:50,267 --> 01:11:53,341\n>> And Jason, if you want to take a peek\nover here there's a couple of these\n\n1626\n01:11:53,341 --> 01:11:55,200\nhardware locks that he's talking about.\n\n1627\n01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:55,965\nLike there's the kind\nthat slips in there and-\n\n1628\n01:11:55,965 --> 01:11:57,370\n>> Yeah, that's the Kingston lock.\n\n1629\n01:11:57,370 --> 01:12:00,662\n>> And you got your keys there\nis a good example of one.\n\n1630\n01:12:00,662 --> 01:12:05,233\nNow, the key right there, I believe that\nis the old t bar locking mechanism and\n\n1631\n01:12:05,233 --> 01:12:08,902\nyou look and all it is, is the little\nlock and it looks like a t and\n\n1632\n01:12:08,902 --> 01:12:12,110\nwhen you turn the key that t\njust kind of locks in place.\n\n1633\n01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:16,515\nAnd then the Kingston locks there is\nthe one where with the little combination\n\n1634\n01:12:16,515 --> 01:12:17,495\ndigits on them.\n\n1635\n01:12:17,495 --> 01:12:22,775\n>> Right and make sure that you\nremember if you secure to a table\n\n1636\n01:12:22,775 --> 01:12:24,225\n>> Make sure the tables secure\n\n1637\n01:12:24,225 --> 01:12:25,815\n>> Yeah I've seen people do this.\n\n1638\n01:12:25,815 --> 01:12:29,950\nWhere you wrap that cable\naround it a leg of a table, and\n\n1639\n01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:32,660\nsomebody picks the table up, like I'll\njust pick the table up, but I was like no,\n\n1640\n01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:34,670\nno, that's not gonna cut it, guys.\n\n1641\n01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:36,660\n>> They do make them too for\nlike docking stations,\n\n1642\n01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:41,120\nbecause the docking station is, you know,\nfirmly attached to the table and\n\n1643\n01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:44,390\nthe chain literally attaches\nto the docking station.\n\n1644\n01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:48,890\nAnd then you use the Kingston lock to lock\nthe laptop to the docking station there.\n\n1645\n01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:49,570\n>> Exactly.\n\n1646\n01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:51,750\nAlright, man traps.\n\n1647\n01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:54,860\nWe'll just leave that one alone.\n\n1648\n01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:56,480\nToo many jokes we could say.\n\n1649\n01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,920\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n1650\n01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,740\nSo if I have an authenticated area, or\n\n1651\n01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:05,860\na doorway going into a secure area,\nthat you need authentication.\n\n1652\n01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:08,160\nWe want to try and\nprevent those piggy backing attacks.\n\n1653\n01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:09,250\nThe tailgating attacks.\n\n1654\n01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:12,050\nAgain, we talk about one authentication,\none entry.\n\n1655\n01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:15,450\nWell, maybe in an extremely\nsecure environment.\n\n1656\n01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:20,440\nWhat you have is one authentication door,\nopens up.\n\n1657\n01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,970\nYou go in the hallway.\n\n1658\n01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:25,380\nThat door closes, you make it to the other\nside of the hallway, and there's another\n\n1659\n01:13:25,380 --> 01:13:28,480\ndoor that you authenticate, and\nwhen you walk into the secure area,\n\n1660\n01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,710\nthe last door closes, and\nlets the next person through.\n\n1661\n01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:34,580\nOther things that you can have\nare like turnstiles that you see, for\n\n1662\n01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:38,160\ninstance, you know, if you go to\nthe subway, if you go to amusement park,\n\n1663\n01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,320\nthat literally locks the person in place.\n\n1664\n01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,260\nYou know, you go int through\nthat turnstile it locks you into\n\n1665\n01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:46,150\nplace while the person in\nfront of you authenticates.\n\n1666\n01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:49,510\nOnce the door closes, the turnstile lets\ngo and then you go through there too, so\n\n1667\n01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:50,310\nthere is all different kinds.\n\n1668\n01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:54,250\nWe see these in courthouses and stuff you\nknow, you have that intermediate station\n\n1669\n01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:58,200\nbetween the, just past or\nbefore prior to, like a metal detector.\n\n1670\n01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:01,080\nSo even a metal detector in that could be\nconsidered a man trap because you have to\n\n1671\n01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,490\nstop right there before\nyou can go into the area.\n\n1672\n01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:04,340\n>> It may be a part of.\n\n1673\n01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:05,860\n>> Or a part of yeah.\n\n1674\n01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:09,490\n>> When you look into those man traps,\nit literally will trap you\n\n1675\n01:14:09,490 --> 01:14:12,390\nif you cannot authenticate or\nif there's something wrong.\n\n1676\n01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:16,690\nI see these in both of the credit unions\nhere in Gainesville that I happen to use\n\n1677\n01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:19,330\nthat have had some robberies\nover the past few years.\n\n1678\n01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:21,150\nSo they've both implemented\nthese man traps,\n\n1679\n01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:25,966\nwhere you go in you cannot open the outer\ndoor unless the inner door's closed, and\n\n1680\n01:14:25,966 --> 01:14:27,700\nthere can only be one\nperson in there at a time.\n\n1681\n01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:30,400\n>> Sure.\nAnd when you open that door, you walk in,\n\n1682\n01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:34,260\nand the inner door's not going to\nopen until the back door closes and\n\n1683\n01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:35,940\nyou've walked through the metal detector.\n\n1684\n01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:37,920\n>> Interesting\n>> And then the green light will come on,\n\n1685\n01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:38,760\nand that door will open.\n\n1686\n01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,430\nAnd if you have sunglasses on or\na hat, the girl won't hit the button.\n\n1687\n01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:43,600\nShe will not let you in.\n\n1688\n01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,280\n>> Right\n>> And\n\n1689\n01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,820\nif there's, so depending on\n>> The security needs, you know,\n\n1690\n01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:50,760\nit might be something where you've\ngot to punch in a pin to get through.\n\n1691\n01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:54,632\nAnd if you don't know the pin, you can't\ngo any further, you can't get back out.\n\n1692\n01:14:54,632 --> 01:14:57,440\nThere are usually cameras mounted in\nthere, there could be speakers, so\n\n1693\n01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,660\nI can interact with\nthe person that's in there.\n\n1694\n01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:03,595\nSome of the higher security places will\nhave scales built into the floors,\n\n1695\n01:15:03,595 --> 01:15:07,410\nsensors built into the floors for weight,\nso they can weigh you on the way in.\n\n1696\n01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:08,720\n>> They can weigh you on the way out.\n\n1697\n01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,570\n>> Interesting.\n>> And if your weight goes up on the way\n\n1698\n01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:13,200\nout, there's a good chance you tried\nto slip something out of the building.\n\n1699\n01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,000\n>> Interesting.\n\n1700\n01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,180\nInteresting.\n>> So they can tell.\n\n1701\n01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:16,700\n>> So the metal detector,\nisn't necessarily,\n\n1702\n01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:19,950\nit could be part of the overall system but\nit's not technically the ban trap itself.\n\n1703\n01:15:19,950 --> 01:15:20,490\n>> Yeah exactly.\nAnd\n\n1704\n01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:23,990\nlike the bank uses a metal detector for\nguns and weapons and things like that.\n\n1705\n01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:26,670\nAnd in some places you might not\nbe able to do metal detectors\n\n1706\n01:15:26,670 --> 01:15:27,560\nbecause maybe they're.\n\n1707\n01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:30,070\nExpected to bring metal parts and\nthings like that.\n\n1708\n01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:30,840\nI don't know.\n\n1709\n01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:32,470\n>> Okay.

Was it video surveillance?\n\n1720\n01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:50,530\n>> Video surveillance, it never stops the\ncriminals, if it did stop the criminals,\n\n1721\n01:15:50,530 --> 01:15:52,240\nwe wouldn't have all those funny videos.\n\n1722\n01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,200\n>> Right.\n\n1723\n01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,870\n>> The guy breaks into the liquor store,\n\n1724\n01:15:54,870 -->

01:16:52,300\nSo video surveillance,\nfencing is another one.\n\n1749\n01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:54,340\nWould be a type of\nphysical security I think.\n\n1750\n01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:55,130\n>> What kind of fencing?\n\n1751\n01:16:55,130 --> 01:16:57,380\n>> Yeah well I had my image pulled up for\nyou guys for that one.\n\n1752\n01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:58,760\nThat's fencing right?\n\n1753\n01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:00,880\nThat's what you're going to\nput around your building.\n\n1754\n01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,050\n>> If I see that guy at the front door,\nI'm not going any

01:17:18,960\nRight?\nI put fences around the place.\n\n1761\n01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,750\nYou've got razor wire up on top of that.\n\n1762\n01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:26,900\nAnd that's to keep the physical access,\nlimit the physical access, right?\n\n1763\n01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,290\n>> Sure.\n>> As you were saying one way in,\n\n1764\n01:17:28,290 --> 01:17:28,830\none way out.\n\n1765\n01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:31,690\nIf I've got a perimeter fence out there,\nit's going to be more difficult for\n\n1766\n01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:35,760\nsomebody to come in through the back\nside of my property without being,\n\n1767\n01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,520\nwithout having to cut a hole in the fence.\n\n1768\n01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,220\n>> They call it a technique\nwhere you're funneling,\n\n1769\n01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:42,970\nwhere your entrance has to\nfunnel in to that one location.\n\n1770\n01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:47,270\nYou don't get seven different\ndoors that you can go out of and\n\n1771\n01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:49,170\neverybody's got to funnel\ninto that one location.\n\n1772\n01:17:49,170 --> 01:17:52,180\nThen the fencing really just\nhelps us

gonna stop on.\n\n1871\n01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:30,060\n>> Interesting.\n\n1872\n01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:32,655\n>> And then when you get off of\nthe elevator, you're in another man trap.\n\n1873\n01:21:32,655 --> 01:21:34,175\nYou've got the elevator behind you, and\n\n1874\n01:21:34,175 --> 01:21:35,835\nyou've got a set of glass\ndoors in front of you.\n\n1875\n01:21:35,835 --> 01:21:37,660\n>> Okay.\n>> And whoever you're there to see has to\n\n1876\n01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:40,010\ncome and let you out, or\nyou're not getting past that either.\n\n1877\n01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:42,090\n>> True access control from point\nA to point B, that's interesting.\n\n1878\n01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:44,220\n>> Exactly, it was secure the whole way.\n\n1879\n01:21:45,430 --> 01:21:47,670\nSo that access list again,\nmight be an electronic thing,\n\n1880\n01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:49,062\nit might be like we do with our key fobs.\n\n1881\n01:21:49,062 --> 01:21:50,700\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now if we hire somebody else or\n\n1882\n01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:54,300\nwe want somebody to be able to come back\nin the studio, we can go modify that list,\n\n1883\n01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:58,280\nand we can add their fob to who's\nallowed to open this particular door.\n\n1884\n01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,260\nAnd then when they swipe it,\nit'll pop that door open.\n\n1885\n01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:03,830\n>> Don's had to do it to this for\nme on a couple of occasions.\n\n1886\n01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:05,280\nWhere's your key fob?\n\n1887\n01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:08,642\nI think it's on the kitchen table.\n\n1888\n01:22:08,642 --> 01:22:09,860\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, right, exactly.\n\n1889\n01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:11,320\n>> So I get to wear the dunce cap for\nthe day.\n\n1890\n01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,780\n>> Yeah, and it doesn't ever have\nthe right access, so you gotta, yeah.\n\n1891\n01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:15,510\n>> The key fob that's attached\nto the 16-pound brick.\n\n1892\n01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:17,120\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So you can't fit,\n\n1893\n01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:20,230\nI always like that when you go to the, it\nreminds me of going to the gas station and\n\n1894\n01:22:20,230 --> 01:22:21,880\nborrowing their restroom key.\n\n1895\n01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:22,470\n>> Yes.\n>> And\n\n1896\n01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:24,850\nit's on a piece of wood about this long,\nso\n\n1897\n01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:27,905\nthat you can't accidentally put it in your\npocket and take it with you or something.\n\n1898\n01:22:27,905 --> 01:22:29,860\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1899\n01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:30,680\n>> Proper lighting.\n\n1900\n01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:31,800\nLighting very important, right?\n\n1901\n01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,420\nIt is a great deterrent.\n\n1902\n01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:35,200\nOh, we are out of time.\n\n1903\n01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,530\nOkay, well, I'll tell you what,\n\n1904\n01:22:36,530 --> 01:22:38,972\nI'll tell you how exciting\nlighting is when we get back here.\n\n1905\n01:22:38,972 --> 01:22:40,640\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1906\n01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:41,188\n>> All right,\n\n1907\n01:22:41,188 --> 01:22:44,200\nit is running up on our break time,\nso let's take a quick break.\n\n1908\n01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:48,000\nWe'll go get refreshments or whatever else\nwe've gotta do, a little bathroom break.\n\n1909\n01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,470\nAnd when we come back, we'll finish\nup talking about physical security,\n\n1910\n01:22:51,470 --> 01:22:53,850\nand we'll wrap things up\nwith some control types.\n\n1911\n01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:57,310\nSo you guys enjoy the break, and\nwe'll see you back here in a few.\n\n1912\n01:22:57,310 --> 01:23:04,270\n[SOUND].\n\n1913\n01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:06,150\nAll right ladies and\ngentlemen, welcome back.\n\n1914\n01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:09,050\nWe are continuing on our\ndiscussion of physical security.\n\n1915\n01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:09,620\nWhat's that?\n\n1916\n01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:13,010\n>> I really want to hear about\nthis proper lighting now.\n\n1917\n01:23:13,010 --> 01:23:13,840\n>> The proper lighting, yeah.\n\n1918\n01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:15,330\n>> We made everybody wait for this.\n\n1919\n01:23:15,330 --> 01:23:18,301\n>> You were sitting on the edge of\nyour seat weren't you, waiting for\n\n1920\n01:23:18,301 --> 01:23:20,140\nproper lighting, yes.\n\n1921\n01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:22,039\nAnd that was it, that's all I had to say.\n\n1922\n01:23:22,039 --> 01:23:23,833\n>> Okay, so.\n>> [LAUGH] Proper lighting is very\n\n1923\n01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:27,832\nimportant, otherwise you get shadows\nunder your nose, and your chin, and\n\n1924\n01:23:27,832 --> 01:23:28,841\nthings like that.\n\n1925\n01:23:28,841 --> 01:23:30,780\n>> Yes.\n>> Lighting obviously is important.\n\n1926\n01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:33,370\nOne of the things that we want to\ndo is we want to make sure that\n\n1927\n01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:36,190\nwe've lighted our entry ways,\nand things like that.\n\n1928\n01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:39,770\nYou don't want to give the bad guys\na nice dark entryway, where they can sit,\n\n1929\n01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:43,280\nand attempt to pick a lock, or\nbypass some kind of security system, or\n\n1930\n01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:44,035\nsomething like that.\n\n1931\n01:23:44,035 --> 01:23:45,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1932\n01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,610\n>> So make sure you got lights.\n\n1933\n01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:49,020\nPeople put out lights for\nlandscaping, right?\n\n1934\n01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:51,900\nAnd it looks pretty when you've got\nthe lights shining up on the building at\n\n1935\n01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:53,400\nnight, and things like that.\n\n1936\n01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,714\nAnd sure it looks good,\nit's got a nice aesthetic value, but\n\n1937\n01:23:55,714 --> 01:23:58,310\none of the main reasons they're\ndoing that is for security, right?\n\n1938\n01:23:58,310 --> 01:24:00,057\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n>> To make sure that my perimeter is all\n\n1939\n01:24:00,057 --> 01:24:02,360\nlit up, there's no way somebody's\ngonna be able to sneak up.\n\n1940\n01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:05,930\nYou don't want big bushes, and they don't\nmention that in here but another one with\n\n1941\n01:24:05,930 --> 01:24:08,840\nphysical security is, you don't have\nbig bushes near your doorways, right?\n\n1942\n01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:09,510\n>> Sure.\n\n1943\n01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:12,290\n>> Places where people could hide,\nand jump out, and things like that and\n\n1944\n01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:13,490\ntry to slip in.\n\n1945\n01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:16,420\nYou wanna keep things clean,\nlow if you have to,\n\n1946\n01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:18,840\nbut keep it away from the entry ways.\n\n1947\n01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:21,000\nYou don't want big bushes and\nthings like that in front of windows.\n\n1948\n01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,120\nYou want those windows lit up so\n\n1949\n01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:26,820\nthat if somebody is trying to get in\nthrough there, that we can see that.\n\n1950\n01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:29,727\n>> Yeah, it's that classic example,\n\n1951\n01:24:29,727 --> 01:24:34,143\nlike if I have to be away from my wife or\nmy kids for while.\n\n1952\n01:24:34,143 --> 01:24:37,857\nLike when she goes to lay down down in\nthe evening, she'll turn the lights on in\n\n1953\n01:24:37,857 --> 01:24:41,205\nthe house to let somebody know hey,\nand a little bit different there.\n\n1954\n01:24:41,205 --> 01:24:43,747\nBut let somebody know that hey,\nthere's somebody home.\n\n1955\n01:24:43,747 --> 01:24:45,580\n>> Right.\n>> And then leaves the porch light on.\n\n1956\n01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:50,044\n>> Absolutely, absolutely, a lot of\nsecurity systems you can have them flick\n\n1957\n01:24:50,044 --> 01:24:54,805\nlights on and off at random times, so\nit does give that appearance of occupancy.\n\n1958\n01:24:54,805 --> 01:24:56,648\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Signs, they're not really, you think,\n\n1959\n01:24:56,648 --> 01:24:58,130\nwell what's a sign do to secure, right?\n\n1960\n01:24:58,130 --> 01:24:58,742\n>> Stay out!\n\n1961\n01:24:58,742 --> 01:25:00,510\n>> But yeah, exactly,\n\n1962\n01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:04,180\nletting them know that there is\na security system in place, and\n\n1963\n01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:08,120\nmaybe that makes them think twice about\npicking your building to try to get into.\n\n1964\n01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:12,780\nOr signs on doors that say, hey\nauthorized access only, this is not for\n\n1965\n01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:13,390\nthe general public, exact, yeah.\n\n1966\n01:25:13,390 --> 01:25:14,270\n>> Yeah, employees only.\n\n1967\n01:25:15,790 --> 01:25:18,650\nI wish they can watch out for\nthe Smith and Wesson.\n\n1968\n01:25:18,650 --> 01:25:20,438\n>> Yeah, right?\n[LAUGH] This house is protected by\n\n1969\n01:25:20,438 --> 01:25:21,640\nSmith and Wesson, exactly.\n\n1970\n01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:25,906\n>> But yeah, clearly defining the areas\nthat are again, like you said, keep out,\n\n1971\n01:25:25,906 --> 01:25:28,440\nemployees only, authorized use only.\n\n1972\n01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:32,330\nEven for safety precautions too,\nhigh voltage area, or\n\n1973\n01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:34,210\nsomething like that as well.\n\n1974\n01:25:35,450 --> 01:25:37,565\n>> Mm-hm, then you've got guards, and\n\n1975\n01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:40,840\nguards in high security areas\nwhere I want a human presence.\n\n1976\n01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:44,515\nI want somebody there that's going to\nstop people that are coming up, and\n\n1977\n01:25:44,515 --> 01:25:47,030\nmaybe they've got to check-in at the check\nhouse before they're allowed to come\n\n1978\n01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:48,580\nthrough that outer perimeter.\n\n1979\n01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:51,430\nOr maybe it's somebody\nthat sits in the lobby\n\n1980\n01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:54,615\nlike at a bank situation where you've\ngot that guard that just stands there.\n\n1981\n01:25:54,615 --> 01:25:56,390\nThat's just a presence and\n\n1982\n01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:59,970\nit makes people hopefully think\ntwice about doing something illegal.\n\n1983\n01:25:59,970 --> 01:26:05,870\n>> And Garge can react to alarms, Garge\ncan react to situations, even if they're,\n\n1984\n01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:09,380\nwe're not talking about the SWAT team,\nthey might be former SWAT team.\n\n1985\n01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:13,133\nBut they can react to situations, where\nif we didn't have that guard present,\n\n1986\n01:26:13,133 --> 01:26:15,330\nwe would be waiting for\nour first responders.\n\n1987\n01:26:15,330 --> 01:26:17,460\n>> Exactly.\n>> They can be our first responders\n\n1988\n01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:18,300\nin house.\n\n1989\n01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:19,240\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1990\n01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:22,935\nThey patrol the area in the evenings, make\nrounds, check doors, things like that.\n\n1991\n01:26:22,935 --> 01:26:23,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1992\n01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:27,260\n>> So guards, dogs would really fall in\nthat same area kinda, I think with guards.\n\n1993\n01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:28,000\n>> Definitely, definitely.\n\n1994\n01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,400\n>> Maybe you have dogs that run around\ninside of the fence at night or\n\n1995\n01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,915\nsomething like that.\n\n1996\n01:26:31,915 --> 01:26:36,115\nBarricades is similar to fencing,\nyou see this a lot.\n\n1997\n01:26:36,115 --> 01:26:41,318\nWhen I left DC, I left DC right after,\nI was in DC for the sniper and\n\n1998\n01:26:41,318 --> 01:26:46,635\n9-11, and we saw a lot of things\nchange over that next year.\n\n1999\n01:26:46,635 --> 01:26:47,155\n>> Sure, sure.\n\n2000\n01:26:47,155 --> 01:26:50,780\n>> You saw a lot more of the concrete\nbarriers being put up, to where there was\n\n2001\n01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:54,717\nno way somebody was going to try to drive\na truck up to the front of that building.\n\n2002\n01:26:54,717 --> 01:26:55,337\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n2003\n01:26:55,337 --> 01:26:58,808\n>> Like, the Pentagon was\nsurrounded by these things, and\n\n2004\n01:26:58,808 --> 01:27:03,664\nyou had your Humvees with the 50 cals up\non the top, and a guard sitting there.\n\n2005\n01:27:03,664 --> 01:27:06,047\nAnd there was a dude with a loaded weapon,\nand\n\n2006\n01:27:06,047 --> 01:27:09,830\nthat made you think twice if you were\ngonna try to do something, right?\n\n2007\n01:27:09,830 --> 01:27:11,150\n>> Sure.\nNow, I think we've talked,\n\n2008\n01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:14,840\nyou've been on some military bases and\nI believe Ronnie has been too,\n\n2009\n01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:19,520\nwhere you see that traditional\nbarricade with a fenced gate.\n\n2010\n01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,570\nGate rolls open so\nwe got fencing, barricade, and\n\n2011\n01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:23,890\nsecurity guard all rolled up into one.\n\n2012\n01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:25,290\n>> Absolutely.\nAnd those little stagger,\n\n2013\n01:27:25,290 --> 01:27:28,505\nthey're those big concrete barricades so\nthat you can't drive straight through.\n\n2014\n01:27:28,505 --> 01:27:31,120\nYou've gotta kinda go around like this so\nit slows you down.\n\n2015\n01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,480\n>> Okay, yeah.\n>> They also see, and\n\n2016\n01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:36,134\nI think it was at one of the posts I was\nat here, they had pylons in the road, and\n\n2017\n01:27:36,134 --> 01:27:38,850\nthose things will shoot up,\nthe hydraulics we control.\n\n2018\n01:27:38,850 --> 01:27:40,290\n>> Literally lift the truck or\ncar off the ground.\n\n2019\n01:27:40,290 --> 01:27:43,462\n>> Yes, the idea is you put them up\nbefore the car gets there, but yeah,\n\n2020\n01:27:43,462 --> 01:27:45,860\nthey could absolutely hit\nthe bottom of the car.\n\n2021\n01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:49,870\nBut yeah, if you try to bust through the\ngate and you didn't stop where that guard\n\n2022\n01:27:49,870 --> 01:27:54,120\ntold you to stop, the other guard sitting\ninside the shack hits the button, and\n\n2023\n01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:56,320\nthe pylons shoot up and\nyou're not getting any further.\n\n2024\n01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:57,745\n>> The may pops, too, right?\n\n2025\n01:27:57,745 --> 01:27:58,660\nYou've got the may pops.\n\n2026\n01:27:58,660 --> 01:27:59,268\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n2027\n01:27:59,268 --> 01:27:59,871\nYou try to go out through the in.\n\n2028\n01:27:59,871 --> 01:28:02,525\n>> I don't know what they're called but\nyeah, you can go in, but go ahead and\n\n2029\n01:28:02,525 --> 01:28:05,030\ntry to back out of there, and\nyou're gonna pop every one of the tires.\n\n2030\n01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:07,089\n[LAUGH] Try to drive around and\ngo through the exit.\n\n2031\n01:28:07,089 --> 01:28:10,290\nThey've got those strips where the nails\nare laid kind of in certain directions.\n\n2032\n01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:11,850\nYou go in this way, no big deal.\n\n2033\n01:28:11,850 --> 01:28:15,765\nIf you're coming in the wrong way,\nyou're going to pop all of your tires.\n\n2034\n01:28:15,765 --> 01:28:17,800\n>> Definitely\n>> Biometrics is a huge deal.\n\n2035\n01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,810\nBiometrics is something we're\nseeing a lot more often.\n\n2036\n01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:21,310\nYeah, right.\n\n2037\n01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:27,430\nAs the technology gets better and the\ndemand goes up, the price comes down and\n\n2038\n01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:30,750\nstarts getting to the point where we can\nput biometrics in a lot more places.\n\n2039\n01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:35,610\nAnd we talk about it in security and\nI think in another one of our episodes.\n\n2040\n01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:38,380\nThere's three things that you can\nbase authentication on, right.\n\n2041\n01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:40,990\nSomething you know,\nsomething you have, something you are.\n\n2042\n01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:42,710\nBiometrics falls under that last one.\n\n2043\n01:28:42,710 --> 01:28:44,040\nSomething you are.\n\n2044\n01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:46,090\nA lot harder to fake.\n\n2045\n01:28:46,090 --> 01:28:49,520\nAnd so it's, I can't really\nleave my finger print at home\n\n2046\n01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:52,030\nlike I can with my RFIDs.\n\n2047\n01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:52,630\n>> Sure.\n\n2048\n01:28:52,630 --> 01:28:54,600\nAnd the technology's getting better.\n\n2049\n01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:57,480\n>> You talk about taking it, you mentioned\nearlier when you were talking about\n\n2050\n01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:01,690\nuser habits and taking that out of\nthe human vulnerability, right?\n\n2051\n01:29:01,690 --> 01:29:06,690\nWhen we authenticate with passwords there\nis a certain level of phishing attacks,\n\n2052\n01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:07,940\nsocial engineering.\n\n2053\n01:29:07,940 --> 01:29:09,570\nWell, now we're taking\nit out of that realm and\n\n2054\n01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:11,350\nlike you said using some characteristics.\n\n2055\n01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:11,990\nTo get the persons.\n\n2056\n01:29:11,990 --> 01:29:13,060\nIt's not so easy.\n\n2057\n01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:16,880\nI'm not saying impossible but\nit's not so easy to duplicate.\n\n2058\n01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:19,170\nAnd a few years back you\nmight have said well,\n\n2059\n01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:22,020\neveryone of these are going to\nbe very expensive to implement.\n\n2060\n01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:24,340\nI belive your iPhone has\na finger print scanner on it.\n\n2061\n01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:27,200\nSo like you said,\nyou're seeing it more and more.\n\n2062\n01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:30,710\nThe Alienware laptop you've got,\ngot's the facial recognition system.\n\n2063\n01:29:30,710 --> 01:29:33,450\n>> It's becoming much more common,\n\n2064\n01:29:33,450 --> 01:29:36,190\nin fact I'm getting ready to replace the\n>> The lock on my front door\n\n2065\n01:29:36,190 --> 01:29:38,020\nwith a biometric at my house.\n\n2066\n01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:38,850\n>> Interesting, very cool.\n\n2067\n01:29:38,850 --> 01:29:40,740\n>> A thumbprint scanner for\nthe front door.\n\n2068\n01:29:42,450 --> 01:29:46,880\nIt's again, for one it's really cool\ntechnology but it's a lot more secure.\n\n2069\n01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:51,410\nYou know, when fingerprint scanners first\ncame out they were really easy to fake.\n\n2070\n01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:54,790\nYou could take gummy bears and roll over\nsomebody's old fingerprint and use that.\n\n2071\n01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:59,620\nSome of these now look for\nGot a heartbeat, temperature maybe,\n\n2072\n01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:06,550\none of the ones I just read about not\ntoo long ago was vascular recognition.\n\n2073\n01:30:06,550 --> 01:30:07,120\n>> Yes.\n\n2074\n01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,020\n>> Where they're looking at the.\n\n2075\n01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:10,220\n>> Circulatory pattern.\n\n2076\n01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:14,140\n>> The pattern of your veins in your hand\n>> One of the issues with\n\n2077\n01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:15,780\nfingerprints is we do\nleave them everywhere.\n\n2078\n01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:16,590\n>> That's right.\n\n2079\n01:30:16,590 --> 01:30:18,830\n>> Everything we touch we leave fingers so\ngive somebody,\n\n2080\n01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:20,600\nyou've seen the cop shows right?\n\n2081\n01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:23,810\nHere have a glass of water and as soon as\nyou drink the glass of water they take\n\n2082\n01:30:23,810 --> 01:30:27,240\nit and they put it in a bag and then now\nthey have your fingerprint all right?\n\n2083\n01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,310\nI don't leave my vascular\npattern anywhere.\n\n2084\n01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:30,170\n>> That's right.\n>> It's much harder for\n\n2085\n01:30:30,170 --> 01:30:32,820\nanybody to steal\n>> Or try to fake but yet\n\n2086\n01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:35,150\njust as unique as a finger print.\n\n2087\n01:30:35,150 --> 01:30:38,240\nSo really cool stuff they're\ndoing with biometrics,\n\n2088\n01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:42,390\ngeometry hand where it's not really\nlooking at any particular patterns.\n\n2089\n01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:46,080\nIt's looking at the distance of between\nthe joints and your first two fingers.\n\n2090\n01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,060\nYou slide it into a box,\n\n2091\n01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:51,090\nit's got some little pins, in fact I could\nprobably pull one up real quick while I\n\n2092\n01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:52,110\nwas thinking about it\n>> And\n\n2093\n01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:55,540\nwhile you're doing that there's another\none that I read about that I didn't know\n\n2094\n01:30:55,540 --> 01:31:00,310\nexisted, kind of assists that biometrics\nand something you are is something you do\n\n2095\n01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:05,950\nan these are keyboards that literally\ncan keep track of your typing, you know,\n\n2096\n01:31:05,950 --> 01:31:11,000\nhow you type and can authenticate you by\na pattern, you know, a characteristic.\n\n2097\n01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,440\nIt's still close to biometrics,\nbut it's a newer one.\n\n2098\n01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,270\nIt's called something you do.\n\n2099\n01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:17,940\n>> That is pretty amazing\nhow they can tell,\n\n2100\n01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:22,700\nif your keyboard has sensitivity,\nhow hard you hit the keys.\n\n2101\n01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:26,890\nOr a west by how many times\nyou hit the backspace.\n\n2102\n01:31:26,890 --> 01:31:29,420\n>> But there's a couple of\nhand geometry type scanners.\n\n2103\n01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:33,390\nYou can see these little entry boxes where\nthey slide their hand in and you can kind\n\n2104\n01:31:33,390 --> 01:31:39,020\nof see the pegs there that she's using and\njust lines the fingers up just right.\n\n2105\n01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:41,610\nSo, that it can pick up the,\nmake sure your got your\n\n2106\n01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:45,810\nhand in the right place where it's can\nget the accurate measurements there.\n\n2107\n01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:48,350\nDisney uses this, now,\nfor their park re entry.\n\n2108\n01:31:48,350 --> 01:31:48,920\n>> Oh, really.\n\n2109\n01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,490\n>> Yeah, because they found that,\nyou know.\n\n2110\n01:31:50,490 --> 01:31:52,960\nWhen I was a kid, they stamped your hand.\n\n2111\n01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,330\nYou'd always go to your friend and\nlick your hand and\n\n2112\n01:31:55,330 --> 01:31:57,620\ntry to rub that stamp\non your buddie's hand.\n\n2113\n01:31:57,620 --> 01:32:01,440\nI can get back in it's just got\na little blurry because I washed my\n\n2114\n01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,540\nhands in the bathroom.\n\n2115\n01:32:02,540 --> 01:32:04,920\nWith the hand geometry it's not worldwide.\n\n2116\n01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:08,473\nThere's no guarantee that there's somebody\nout there that has the same distance but\n\n2117\n01:32:08,473 --> 01:32:11,925\nthey figure they did studies, and for the\nnumber of people they've got going in and\n\n2118\n01:32:11,925 --> 01:32:13,688\nout of the park on that day\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n2119\n01:32:13,688 --> 01:32:14,763\n>> There's enough difference.\n\n2120\n01:32:14,763 --> 01:32:16,087\n>> Got you.\n>> They can use it for that.\n\n2121\n01:32:16,087 --> 01:32:17,493\n>> Sure.\n>> Even between twins they said.\n\n2122\n01:32:17,493 --> 01:32:18,114\n>> Oh really?\n>> Yeah.\n\n2123\n01:32:18,114 --> 01:32:19,355\n>> Interesting.\n>> So lots of things.\n\n2124\n01:32:19,355 --> 01:32:23,010\nWe've seen NCIS and some of those other\nshows where they're using the the iris\n\n2125\n01:32:23,010 --> 01:32:24,620\nscanners, the retina scanners.\n\n2126\n01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:26,620\nThere's voice scanners.\n\n2127\n01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:29,470\nYou know, we're probably going to see more\n\n2128\n01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:30,587\nbiometrics\n>> Yeah.\n\n2129\n01:32:30,587 --> 01:32:32,639\n>> As the technology gets better.\n\n2130\n01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:34,074\n>> Mm-hm

right?\n\n2134\n01:32:37,736 --> 01:32:39,350\n>> Right.\n>> When we're taking about bound media,\n\n2135\n01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:42,180\nwe want to make sure that our\ncables not are running in a place\n\n2136\n01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:44,476\nwhere somebody can access them\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2137\n01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:45,170\n>> Easily.\n\n2138\n01:32:45,170 --> 01:32:46,350\nEspecially with copper media.\n\n2139\n01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:48,480\n>> Yes.\n>> Not so easy with fiber optic media, and\n\n2140\n01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,200\nit's not that it's impossible.\n\n2141\n01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:54,080\nBut you need, you don't just cut a cable,\na fiber optic cable and\n\n2142\n01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,320\nthen just put an end on it.\n\n2143\n01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:55,870\n>> Right.\n\n2144\n01:32:55,870 --> 01:32:56,740\nYes.\n>> They use those\n\n2145\n01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:58,250\nfusion splicers and stuff.\n\n2146\n01:32:58,250 --> 01:33:00,130\nSo, it takes some equipment\nto be able to do it.\n\n2147\n01:33:00,130 --> 01:33:01,300\nBut with copper media?\n\n2148\n01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:03,970\n>> Absolutely.\n>> I mean, twisted pair, cut the

something\n>> Yeah definitely\n\n2152\n01:33:07,744 --> 01:33:09,290\n>> Or a little wireless access point and\n\n2153\n01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:12,900\ngo from there, especially in places where\nyou get shared spaces if you're talking\n\n2154\n01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:15,370\nabout a strip mall type environment\n\n2155\n01:33:15,370 --> 01:33:18,640\nwhere I've got multiple offices\nall tied in the same building.\n\n2156\n01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:21,540\nAll of our cabling probably\nruns together at some point or\n\n2157\n01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:23,740\nit's running up in a ceiling\nwhere I've got drop tiles.\n\n2158\n01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:27,210\nAnd maybe my tiles run\nacross my neighbor's ceiling\n\n2159\n01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:31,340\nover that shared junction box or that\npast panel at the end of the building.\n\n2160\n01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:35,540\nSo somebody could lift a tile and\njust you know or splice right in.\n\n2161\n01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:38,820\n>> It goes back to port

--> 01:33:45,030\nplates on the wall so\nthat you can not just plug into a system.\n\n2164\n01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:48,440\nNow, you've also gotta keep in mind\nthat we are talking about physical\n\n2165\n01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:50,980\nsecurity, and\nif somebody can get that far you\n\n2166\n01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:53,520\ndefinitely have to go back and check some\nof the other things that we're talking\n\n2167\n01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,130\nabout because now they've\nmade it into your building.\n\n2168\n01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:56,870\n>> Right.\n>> But there again, you say shared

Mm-hm.\n>> Right?\n\n2182\n01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:31,920\nIf any one of these sensors we talk about,\nlike locks.\n\n2183\n01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:33,380\nAnd what are some other things?\n\n2184\n01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:35,720\nI'm trying to think about what else here.\n\n2185\n01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:37,910\nWe haven't talked about\nmotion detectors yet.\n\n2186\n01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:38,570\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But alarms.\n\n2187\n01:34:38,570 --> 01:34:39,610\nYou guy know what an alarm is, right?\n\n2188\n01:34:39,610 --> 01:34:40,720\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's going to make some kind of\n\n2189\n01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:41,880\naudible alert.\n\n2190\n01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,670\nThe D mark, thank you.\n\n2191\n01:34:43,670 --> 01:34:44,550\n>> Yes.\n>> That's what\n\n2192\n01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:47,140\nI was thinking of earlier, Paul.\n\n2193\n01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:47,820\nPerfect.\n\n2194\n01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:51,020\nIf one of our security\nmechanisms is triggered,\n\n2195\n01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:52,815\nwe want some type of notification, right?\n\n2196\n01:34:52,815 --> 01:34:54,260\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, we have alarms.\n\n2197\n01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:57,490\nMaybe we have alarms on certain doors or.\n\n2198\n01:34:57,490 --> 01:35:00,290\nAt night for example here when we\nleave shop we close everything\n\n2199\n01:35:00,290 --> 01:35:03,300\nup we close everything up and\nwe set the alarm on the way out.\n\n2200\n01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:05,350\nSo there's somebody trying\nto come in at night and\n\n2201\n01:35:05,350 --> 01:35:08,390\nthey don't know the right code\nthey're going to set off the alarm.\n\n2202\n01:35:08,390 --> 01:35:11,485\nAnd that might be\nan in-house audible alert so\n\n2203\n01:35:11,485 --> 01:35:13,435\nhopefully somebody in the area hears it.\n\n2204\n01:35:13,435 --> 01:35:16,365\nIt could be a silent alarm that\ndoesn't let the intruder know\n\n2205\n01:35:16,365 --> 01:35:17,935\nthat they've been detected yet.\n\n2206\n01:35:17,935 --> 01:35:20,655\nAnd it's notified the authorities and\nthey're on the way and\n\n2207\n01:35:20,655 --> 01:35:23,110\nthey can catch them in the building or\nsomething like that.\n\n2208\n01:35:23,110 --> 01:35:25,690\nOr it could be,\nlike you were talking about earlier,\n\n2209\n01:35:25,690 --> 01:35:27,910\nyour guards that you have in place.\n\n2210\n01:35:27,910 --> 01:35:30,800\nSee the alarm that's been\ntriggered on floor 15.\n\n2211\n01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,940\nThey're going to go up there and\nsee what's going on.\n\n2212\n01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:34,090\n>> That's right.\nPhysical presence.\n\n2213\n01:35:34,090 --> 01:35:36,410\n>> And then motion detection.\n\n2214\n01:35:36,410 --> 01:35:38,820\nMotion detection is\nobviously going to detect\n\n2215\n01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:41,100\n>> Yeah, imagine that.\n\n2216\n01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:41,850\nWell we couple that.\n\n2217\n01:35:41,850 --> 01:35:44,630\nYou know with our security system,\nyou know, it is coupled with you know,\n\n2218\n01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:47,930\nnot only an alarm system but\nalso, you know, motion sensors.\n\n2219\n01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:49,274\n>> Absolutely\n>> Let us say theoretically\n\n2220\n01:35:49,274 --> 01:35:50,522\nthere was a way to get in from the roof.\n\n2221\n01:35:50,522 --> 01:35:54,921\nYou know, maybe that that portion of the\nbuilding doesn't have sensors on it but\n\n2222\n01:35:54,921 --> 01:35:59,579\nthat's okay, because the moment you get in\nthe building and you walk past that motion\n\n2223\n01:35:59,579 --> 01:36:02,875\nsensor it's going to do the same\nthing as breaking a window or\n\n2224\n01:36:02,875 --> 01:36:04,256\nopening the front door.\n\n2225\n01:36:04,256 --> 01:36:07,214\n>> The motion sensor can be set\nup to do any number of things,\n\n2226\n01:36:07,214 --> 01:36:11,462\nit can trigger an alarm It could turn on\na light system you know, it could trigger,\n\n2227\n01:36:11,462 --> 01:36:14,970\nI don't know, cameras that kick\ninto play or something like that,\n\n2228\n01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:18,665\nmaybe your cameras you don't want\nthem recording you know nothing, so\n\n2229\n01:36:18,665 --> 01:36:21,040\nonly if there's motion\nthe camera kicks in.\n\n2230\n01:36:21,040 --> 01:36:23,915\nWe see this a lot of these on home\nsecurity system, where I don't have\n\n2231\n01:36:23,915 --> 01:36:28,885\nthe same data storage capabilities, so\nI can't just run cameras 24 hours a day.\n\n2232\n01:36:28,885 --> 01:36:32,725\nSo they kick in when motion is detected,\nand it'll snap a coupe of frames.\n\n2233\n01:36:32,725 --> 01:36:36,155\n>> And it triggers the camera to position\nitself at a certain direction to\n\n2234\n01:36:36,155 --> 01:36:37,664\nbased on the motion\nsensor that's triggered.\n\n2235\n01:36:37,664 --> 01:36:43,380\nConnected to a UPS and\n\n2236\n01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:45,930\ncellular term makes it harder\n>> That's a very good point Will,\n\n2237\n01:36:45,930 --> 01:36:49,130\nbecause if something does come in and\ntries to cut your phone lines first,\n\n2238\n01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:50,620\nnow your alarm system is shot.\n\n2239\n01:36:50,620 --> 01:36:53,720\nIt's not going to be able send\nout the same notifications.\n\n2240\n01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:57,190\nSo you want to, we talked about redundancy\nearlier Will that's a really good way,\n\n2241\n01:36:57,190 --> 01:36:58,530\n>> A good security redundancy.\n\n2242\n01:36:58,530 --> 01:37:02,920\n>> Yup, a good way to put some redundancy\nin my security system is to have a UPS,\n\n2243\n01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:06,425\nso if they cut power,\nthe alarm system doesn't go out, and\n\n2244\n01:37:06,425 --> 01:37:09,725\nto go via the cell because what are the\nodds of them bringing a jammer with them,\n\n2245\n01:37:09,725 --> 01:37:13,335\nright, or something like, they might cut\nthe phone line, but probably not going\n\n2246\n01:37:13,335 --> 01:37:15,305\nto be able to cut the signal\n>> I was watching a show,\n\n2247\n01:37:15,305 --> 01:37:19,540\nI think it was called \"Street Thief\" or\nsomething, but this guy was good.\n\n2248\n01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:22,792\nFirst thing he did was walk to\nthe outside of the building and\n\n2249\n01:37:22,792 --> 01:37:27,900\nkind of did like this whole\nscaling the building Jackie Chan\n\n2250\n01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:31,900\nthing and grabbed the alarm system and\nliterally spliced it.\n\n2251\n01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:35,330\nSpliced the telephone everything and\nthen went back and waited and\n\n2252\n01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:39,060\nwhen there was nobody around he threw a\nbrick through the window and then waited.\n\n2253\n01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:39,740\nDidn't go in.\n\n2254\n01:37:39,740 --> 01:37:43,030\nJust to see if he truly\nhad cut the alarm system.\n\n2255\n01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:43,860\n>> Had disabled it, right?\n\n2256\n01:37:43,860 --> 01:37:46,370\n>> And after about 20 minutes of\nnobody coming in, it's open shop.\n\n2257\n01:37:46,370 --> 01:37:49,260\n>> I had a buddy,\nthis was at a home not a business,\n\n2258\n01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:52,980\nbut had a motion detector\nset up outside of his house.\n\n2259\n01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:54,460\nAnd the motion detectors at night,\n\n2260\n01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:58,220\nif they went off,\nit would I think chirp the alarm.\n\n2261\n01:37:58,220 --> 01:38:02,320\nAnd if it went off again within a certain\namount of time in the same sensor,\n\n2262\n01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:06,700\nit would kick on the lights and trigger\nhis sprinkler system for the zone for\n\n2263\n01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:07,310\nthat area-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n2264\n01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:08,150\n>> Of his house.\n\n2265\n01:38:08,150 --> 01:38:12,837\nSo now he had kicked on the lights and\nfired on the sprinkler system, so\n\n2266\n01:38:12,837 --> 01:38:14,912\nI thought that was a good idea.\n\n2267\n01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:17,145\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> So that's some of the physical security\n\n2268\n01:38:17,145 --> 01:38:19,915\ntypes that they're going\nto call out on this exam.\n\n2269\n01:38:19,915 --> 01:38:22,390\nJust being familiar with what they are.\n\n2270\n01:38:22,390 --> 01:38:26,000\nWhere I might implement them,\nand what they are going to do for\n\n2271\n01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:30,410\nme as far as hardware locks\nare going to prevent hardware theft.\n\n2272\n01:38:30,410 --> 01:38:31,510\nAnd things like that.\n\n2273\n01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:33,860\n>> Nothing like watering the grass,\nwhen you've got somebody in your house.\n\n2274\n01:38:33,860 --> 01:38:35,112\n>> That's right.\n\n2275\n01:38:35,112 --> 01:38:38,250\nAll right, so then we're going\nto get into control types and\n\n2276\n01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:39,740\nwhen we talk about control types,\n\n2277\n01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:43,020\nthere are couple of different ones that\nthey have listed in our objectives.\n\n2278\n01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:47,500\nThey've got deterrents,\npreventative controls, detective controls,\n\n2279\n01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:53,880\ncompensation controls, technical controls,\nand then administrative controls.\n\n2280\n01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:56,550\nand we just want to make sure we\nunderstand the difference, and\n\n2281\n01:38:56,550 --> 01:39:00,210\nmaybe an example or two of each one.\n\n2282\n01:39:00,210 --> 01:39:02,180\nDeterrents are just that.\n\n2283\n01:39:02,180 --> 01:39:05,480\nThey're going to try to discourage\nthe attacker from attacking\n\n2284\n01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:06,350\nin the first place.\n\n2285\n01:39:08,150 --> 01:39:11,230\nSeveral types of controls\nmight cross some boundaries.\n\n2286\n01:39:11,230 --> 01:39:16,130\nSometimes it's difficult to classify\nit as a single control type, but\n\n2287\n01:39:16,130 --> 01:39:21,040\ndeterrents might be guards,\ncameras, signs.\n\n2288\n01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:24,510\nThey'd be deterrents because I see\nthat they've got an alarm system and\n\n2289\n01:39:24,510 --> 01:39:26,030\nI'm not going to go there.\n\n2290\n01:39:26,030 --> 01:39:28,740\nSo, anything that might prevent\nthe attack from occurring at all.\n\n2291\n01:39:28,740 --> 01:39:33,300\n>> I've seen dummy cameras,\nnot saying the camera's not intelligent.\n\n2292\n01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:34,740\n>> They're not hooked up to anything.\n\n2293\n01:39:34,740 --> 01:39:36,270\n>> They're not hooked up to anything.\n\n2294\n01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:39,900\nIt literally just as\na nine volt battery in it\n\n2295\n01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:42,780\nto make it look like it's operational.\n\n2296\n01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:46,140\n>> Signs, as well, are used a lot\nof times as a deterrent, you know,\n\n2297\n01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:48,630\nI don't have an alarm system.\n\n2298\n01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:50,160\n>> Right.\n>> But I got a sign out there that says I\n\n2299\n01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:50,960\ndo, right?\n\n2300\n01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:51,720\n>> Right.\n\n2301\n01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:55,070\n>> Stickers in all the windows\nthat say I do, that kind of thing.\n\n2302\n01:39:55,070 --> 01:39:55,940\nSo deterrents,\n\n2303\n01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:59,710\nagain, just really trying to prevent the\nattack from occurring in the first place.\n\n2304\n01:39:59,710 --> 01:40:04,370\nPrevention, stop an attack\nbefore it can cause damage.\n\n2305\n01:40:04,370 --> 01:40:05,920\nThis might be like a man trap.\n\n2306\n01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:06,440\nRight?\n\n2307\n01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:08,630\nBecause, you know,\nthey have made it through that first door,\n\n2308\n01:40:08,630 --> 01:40:10,130\nthey're not going to make it\nthrough that second door.\n\n2309\n01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:13,890\nWe realize now that it was unauthorized\naccess attempt, and it's going to stop\n\n2310\n01:40:13,890 --> 01:40:17,040\nthe attack before it can cause damage or\nnot able to get out of the man trap.\n\n2311\n01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:20,430\n>> Goes back to hardware locks,\nbarricades, fences,\n\n2312\n01:40:20,430 --> 01:40:23,360\nstop it before it even happens\n>> Exactly, and\n\n2313\n01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:27,690\nthen you get detective type controls,\nand these are going to be controls like\n\n2314\n01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:30,650\ncameras, recordings you know,\naudible recordings, things like that.\n\n2315\n01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:33,540\nThey're going to, they don't really\ndo anything to stop the attack right?\n\n2316\n01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:35,430\n>> But\nthey'll be scrutinized after the fact\n\n2317\n01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:36,560\n>> If you've got the guard sitting down\n\n2318\n01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:40,730\nthere watching all those little CCTV's and\nhe's got the cameras mounted in different\n\n2319\n01:40:40,730 --> 01:40:44,480\nplaces, and they scroll through or\nwhatever, and he can see that.\n\n2320\n01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:47,990\nSo the camera itself,\nit is just a detective attack or\n\n2321\n01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:53,420\na detective type control that's going\nto detect the attacks in progress.\n\n2322\n01:40:53,420 --> 01:40:56,650\nIt doesn't really do anything to stop it.\n\n2323\n01:40:56,650 --> 01:41:00,270\nCompensation attacks support\nother physical controls.\n\n2324\n01:41:00,270 --> 01:41:02,110\nThis is where again it kind\nof blurs a little bit.\n\n2325\n01:41:02,110 --> 01:41:05,470\nI would think that the camera\ncould also be considered\n\n2326\n01:41:05,470 --> 01:41:07,450\na compensation to help with the guard.\n\n2327\n01:41:07,450 --> 01:41:09,300\nThe guard can't watch\nevery place at one time.\n\n2328\n01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:11,280\n>> Right.\n>> But with the aid of cameras,\n\n2329\n01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:14,680\nthat guard could be viewing more\nplaces than he could without them.\n\n2330\n01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:15,710\n>> That's absolutely correct.\n\n2331\n01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:18,880\nMotion sensors that trigger alarms\nthat the guard's monitoring.\n\n2332\n01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:21,990\nSo it's like you said,\nthey blur the line there.\n\n2333\n01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:25,830\n>> And so in the end it could be that\nmotion detector is a detection type\n\n2334\n01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:29,880\ndevice, but it's also a compensation\ntype control because it is helping,\n\n2335\n01:41:29,880 --> 01:41:31,130\nit's turning on the lights, for example.\n\n2336\n01:41:31,130 --> 01:41:31,670\n>> Okay, yeah.\n>> So\n\n2337\n01:41:31,670 --> 01:41:34,730\nany type of control that\nsupports other physical controls.\n\n2338\n01:41:34,730 --> 01:41:37,860\nIt's not an alarm that starts\nspitting out money when it triggers?\n\n2339\n01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:38,360\n>> No.\n\n2340\n01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:40,650\nTechnical controls.\n\n2341\n01:41:40,650 --> 01:41:44,930\nHardware, software that aids\nin protecting physical assets.\n\n2342\n01:41:44,930 --> 01:41:49,220\nI don't know,\na lot of these do become kind of the same,\n\n2343\n01:41:49,220 --> 01:41:52,570\nyour software control might be\na program you run on your computer.\n\n2344\n01:41:52,570 --> 01:41:53,860\n>> How about an IPS?\n\n2345\n01:41:53,860 --> 01:41:55,530\n>> What's that?\n>> about an IPS intrusion prevention\n\n2346\n01:41:55,530 --> 01:41:56,900\nsystem\n>> oh yea na intrusion prevention system\n\n2347\n01:41:56,900 --> 01:41:57,920\n>> in line on a firewall\n\n2348\n01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:58,730\n>> Absolutely\n\n2349\n01:41:58,730 --> 01:41:59,790\n>> firewall itself.\n\n2350\n01:41:59,790 --> 01:42:01,290\n>> Absolutely\n>> We're trying to\n\n2351\n01:42:01,290 --> 01:42:03,540\njust a little bit more technical there.\n\n2352\n01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:05,780\n>> Yup\n>> ACL's, we talked about as well.\n\n2353\n01:42:05,780 --> 01:42:08,355\n>> Right, the Alienware laptop\nthat I've got does that as well,\n\n2354\n01:42:08,355 --> 01:42:11,805\nwith facial recognition, if somebody\nelse sits down in front of that laptop,\n\n2355\n01:42:11,805 --> 01:42:15,055\nif I leave it unlocked,\nit detects that it's not my face and\n\n2356\n01:42:15,055 --> 01:42:18,895\nit locks my screen, so that would\nbe an example of technical control.\n\n2357\n01:42:18,895 --> 01:42:21,665\n>> ok yea\n>> All right and administrative control,\n\n2358\n01:42:21,665 --> 01:42:26,520\nleverage security policies, and\nare used to train personnel.\n\n2359\n01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:30,870\nSo these are our policies\nthat we put in place,\n\n2360\n01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:34,120\nour meetings that we have, our lunch and\nlearns and things like that.\n\n2361\n01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:38,400\nThey need administrative controls\nthat we're trying to put in place to\n\n2362\n01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,410\neducate our users or\neducate our personnel.\n\n2363\n01:42:40,410 --> 01:42:42,060\nTo help maintain security.\n\n2364\n01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:43,650\n>> It's a response policy.\n\n2365\n01:42:43,650 --> 01:42:45,140\nIncidents managements.\n\n2366\n01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:47,880\n>> Exactly, exactly\n>> and\n\n2367\n01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:51,620\nthat my friends pretty much\nwraps up objective 2.7 for us.\n\n2368\n01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:56,220\nCompare and contrast physical security and\nenvironmental controls.\n\n2369\n01:42:56,220 --> 01:42:58,840\nSo if

you want\nto add to what we've gone over today?\n\n2372\n01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:05,580\n>> No, not at all.\n\n2373\n01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:06,510\nI think we're good.\n\n2374\n01:43:06,510 -->

You are watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.316 --> 00:00:14.708\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here on ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:14.708 --> 00:00:19.974\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we're taking the CompTIA Security+.\n\n6\n00:00:19.974 --> 00:00:24.723\nWe're specifically gonna be diving into\nthe realm of basic forensic procedures.\n\n7\n00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:28.689\nAnd here to help us out to make sure that\nwe actually know the things that we need\n\n8\n00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.420\nto is gonna be Ms Cherokee Boose.\n\n9\n00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.650\nCherokee, welcome back to our show.\n\n10\n00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.560\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.050\nYeah, so today we're gonna be looking\nat our basic forensic procedures.\n\n12\n00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.092\nIf you're following along\nwith the objectives,\n\n13\n00:00:40.092 --> 00:00:41.703\nwe're gonna try to focus in on 2.4.\n\n14\n00:00:41.703 --> 00:00:46.186\nSo if we look at that particular first\nobjective, it says given a particular\n\n15\n00:00:46.186 --> 00:00:50.230\nscenario, go ahead and\nimplement basic forensic procedures.\n\n16\n00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.210\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\n\n17\n00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.370\nstart by looking at something on my screen\nhere called the order of volatility.\n\n18\n00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.374\nSo the order of volatility is actually\ncalled out by a request for comment 3227.\n\n19\n00:01:01.374 --> 00:01:06.913\nAnd your order of volatility states, look,\nthere's an incident that's just happened.\n\n20\n00:01:06.913 --> 00:01:10.807\nYou need to collect the information,\nthe potential evidence,\n\n21\n00:01:10.807 --> 00:01:13.920\nin the order in which it\ncould potentially vanish.\n\n22\n00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.710\nSo you wanna get the most time\nsensitive information first.\n\n23\n00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.887\nSo if we look at the top of this pyramid\nhere, you can see some information\n\n24\n00:01:21.887 --> 00:01:26.563\nstored in your CPU, your registers and\nany kind of information stored in cache.\n\n25\n00:01:26.563 --> 00:01:30.490\nThat temporary storage should\nbe looked at and obtained first.\n\n26\n00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.550\nSo moving down this pyramid here, you can\nsee the different types of information and\n\n27\n00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.400\nthe order that you should proceed.\n\n28\n00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.290\nWe have routing tables.\n\n29\n00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.035\nSo you also wanna think about your\nenvironment, your network, right?\n\n30\n00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:49.840\nSo let's say someone were to go ahead and\nsend an email, okay.\n\n31\n00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.998\nAnd your email contains some fraudulent\ninformation that could implement that into\n\n32\n00:01:53.998 --> 00:01:55.060\na particular crime.\n\n33\n00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.858\nSo not only is the computer that\nthe person is working on can be used for\n\n34\n00:01:59.858 --> 00:02:03.515\nevidence, but\nyour networking equipment as well.\n\n35\n00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:08.305\nBecause it stores valuable information\nin the routing table that will just\n\n36\n00:02:08.305 --> 00:02:12.713\neven make it more factual that they\ndid use your network to go ahead and\n\n37\n00:02:12.713 --> 00:02:15.340\ntransmit that information.\n\n38\n00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.410\n&gt;&gt; Now, Cherokee, we need to understand\nthis idea of the order of volatility\n\n39\n00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.810\nbecause of the way that computer systems\nreally do essentially function for us.\n\n40\n00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.820\nA lot of times when you are actually\ndoing something like what we're talking\n\n41\n00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.430\nabout here in this forensic procedure,\nwhat we have to realize is that,\n\n42\n00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.120\nif you unplug the actual computer,\n\n43\n00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.690\na lot of the evidence may disappear\nbecause of where it was stored.\n\n44\n00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.989\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the attacker could even\nhave some kind of script to generate,\n\n45\n00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.878\nalmost like a Dead Man's Switch,\nto go ahead and\n\n46\n00:02:42.878 --> 00:02:47.257\ndestroy that information if you do\nsomething like shut your system down.\n\n47\n00:02:47.257 --> 00:02:50.806\nSo you wanna be careful and while\nthe system is still live, immediately,\n\n48\n00:02:50.806 --> 00:02:52.830\nas soon as possible, right?\n\n49\n00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.300\nAnd we need to go ahead and\ngo through this process because well,\n\n50\n00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.240\nin the United States, let's face it, there\nare a lot of different laws out there for\n\n51\n00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.520\nspecific industries and\nsecurity incidents.\n\n52\n00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.310\nWell, what's a security incident?\n\n53\n00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.030\nA security incident is any\nkind of incident that defies\n\n54\n00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.695\nyour organization's security policy or\notherwise the law.\n\n55\n00:03:13.695 --> 00:03:18.970\nSo in other countries, in the UK,\nthere are a lot of other laws,\n\n56\n00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.804\nand the way that we actually do\nbusiness with them internationally.\n\n57\n00:03:21.804 --> 00:03:25.172\nBut here in the states,\nyou're probably gonna have to go to court,\n\n58\n00:03:25.172 --> 00:03:26.840\nwhether it be criminal or civil.\n\n59\n00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.287\nSo you need to think about the collection\nof this evidence to preserve it for\n\n60\n00:03:31.287 --> 00:03:32.142\nlitigation.\n\n61\n00:03:32.142 --> 00:03:34.598\nSo the main process, the concept here,\n\n62\n00:03:34.598 --> 00:03:39.680\nis we are going through all these steps to\ngo ahead and generate a forensics report.\n\n63\n00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.420\nSo that's what we will\nbe taking to court here.\n\n64\n00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.100\nSo that's why it's so\nimportant to go in this order to\n\n65\n00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.250\ntry to get that information to help\nsolidify your case against the attacker.\n\n66\n00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.450\n&gt;&gt; And that's really the primary\ngoal behind understanding this\n\n67\n00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.070\nbasic forensics procedures is so\nthat we can go ahead, and\n\n68\n00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.600\nif somebody has violated some type of\ninternal security policy that really\n\n69\n00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.625\nis gonna be prosecutable in a crime, or\nit's actually some type of civil suit.\n\n70\n00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:10.190\nThat we're actually following the actual\ntrails or the rules of evidence, so\n\n71\n00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.620\nthat we can ensure that it's gonna be\ngathered in something that's gonna be\n\n72\n00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.800\nacceptable in court as well.\n\n73\n00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.140\nSo in that instance,\nkind of give us a scenario here, Cherokee,\n\n74\n00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.225\nwhere we might actually have this go on.\n\n75\n00:04:21.225 --> 00:04:24.673\nYou've mentioned in a couple of\ntimes just the idea of security, but\n\n76\n00:04:24.673 --> 00:04:27.145\nwhat's a scenario that\nwe might actually face.\n\n77\n00:04:27.145 --> 00:04:31.522\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so if there's a particular\nemployee within your organization that you\n\n78\n00:04:31.522 --> 00:04:36.496\nsuspect is engaging in any type of fraud,\nperhaps internal fraud, and they're using,\n\n79\n00:04:36.496 --> 00:04:38.117\nwe're talking about BYOD.\n\n80\n00:04:38.117 --> 00:04:41.635\nWe've mentioned this before,\nfor bring your own device.\n\n81\n00:04:41.635 --> 00:04:45.185\nSo they're using their equipment,\ntheir laptop, but\n\n82\n00:04:45.185 --> 00:04:49.480\nthey're transmitting malicious\nemails over your network.\n\n83\n00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.575\nYou really need to look at that legal\nrealm before you just run over there and\n\n84\n00:04:53.575 --> 00:04:54.876\nsnatch their laptops.\n\n85\n00:04:54.876 --> 00:04:58.225\nYou wanna make sure that you're\nadhering to the proper rules and\n\n86\n00:04:58.225 --> 00:04:59.420\nguidelines as well.\n\n87\n00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.790\nAnd make sure you're not overstepping\nany boundaries, illegal boundaries for\n\n88\n00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:04.960\nyour jurisdiction or\n\n89\n00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.070\nyour geographic region because that\ncould be inadmissible in court.\n\n90\n00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.650\nIn any moment I will show you a few\nthings that I have pulled from an RFC\n\n91\n00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.100\njust to go ahead and explain what we\nactually can bring to court with us.\n\n92\n00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.910\nAll right, so Cherokee, what's\nthe importance of the RFC now that you've\n\n93\n00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.140\nmentioned it for\nwhat we're taking to look at?\n\n94\n00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.850\nIs it just because it's just a guideline\nor is it something that we really need to\n\n95\n00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.090\nfollow to help us out in the procedures\nthat we're gonna be seeing?\n\n96\n00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.780\n&gt;&gt; All right, let me go ahead and\npull up my screen here.\n\n97\n00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.990\nSo this particular RFC,\nthis is RFC 3227 here.\n\n98\n00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.790\nThis is a guideline, exactly.\n\n99\n00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.742\nSo Guidelines for\nEvidence Collection and Archiving.\n\n100\n00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:46.661\nAnd a lot of the information that I'll\nbe showing you on the slides here,\n\n101\n00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:48.790\nI actually pulled from this document.\n\n102\n00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.160\nSo it's legit,\nit's straight from the horse's mouth here.\n\n103\n00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.000\nAnd there're also additional type of\nguidelines that you guys can find online.\n\n104\n00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.800\nIf we switch over to this tab here,\nSANS has a really great\n\n105\n00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.430\nplethora of documents and\nguidelines on their website as well.\n\n106\n00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.190\nSo this particular document\nis the whitepaper to detail\n\n107\n00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.880\nforensic procedure for laptop computers.\n\n108\n00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.910\nSo depending on the different scenarios,\nyou might need to do a little\n\n109\n00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.440\ninvestigatory research before you\njust go ahead and dive right in.\n\n110\n00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.320\nSo you wanna make sure you're\nfollowing all the potential steps.\n\n111\n00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.780\nSo what we're covering here in this\nepisode is gonna be a general guideline.\n\n112\n00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.660\nYour organization might\nbe slightly different but\n\n113\n00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.280\nthere are some core basics\nthat we really need to follow.\n\n114\n00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.420\n&gt;&gt; And that idea that order of volatility\nis really kind of the first step when we\n\n115\n00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:45.110\nstart gathering the evidence and\nall the things that we need if we know\n\n116\n00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.470\nthat we're going to be pursuing some type\nof case against either that individual or\n\n117\n00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:54.130\na company or whoever the actual bad actor\nis gonna be in this particular case.\n\n118\n00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.210\nSo understanding that and\n\n119\n00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.320\nhaving good solid guidelines in\nhand is probably gonna help out.\n\n120\n00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.830\nBecause what normally happens if we\ndon't have these guidelines in hands,\n\n121\n00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.510\nis that it's fairly simple.\n\n122\n00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.440\nCherokee may come to a business,\n\n123\n00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.780\nand think,oh,\nI know that this incident happened.\n\n124\n00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.520\nI know exactly what to do.\n\n125\n00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.720\nI may come and see the same thing, and\nI may think I know exactly what to do.\n\n126\n00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.690\nThe guidelines essentially help\nus to establish that here's what\n\n127\n00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.470\nneeds to be done, regardless of whether my\npersonal preference is to do it one way,\n\n128\n00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.470\nregardless of whether Cherokee's\npreference is to do another way.\n\n129\n00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.750\nThese standards are probably the ones\nthat have been tested, and tried over and\n\n130\n00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:30.730\nover again.\n\n131\n00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.290\nSo that when it comes down to\nbeing admissible in court,\n\n132\n00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.130\nthose are probably the ones\nwe need to follow.\n\n133\n00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.160\nYes, and more importantly,\n\n134\n00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.550\nif you're planning on obtaining this\ncertification, CompTIA is going to expect\n\n135\n00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.510\nyou to understand this concept\nof order of volatility.\n\n136\n00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.810\nSo let's just look at it on\nmy screen one more time so\n\n137\n00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.900\nyou can get a clear understanding here.\n\n138\n00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.037\nWe looked at the cpu registers and\nthe cache but\n\n139\n00:07:51.037 --> 00:07:55.383\nkind of just falling down this\npyramid here you see our RAM okay,\n\n140\n00:07:55.383 --> 00:07:59.262\nwe see our temporary file system,\nour hard disk drives.\n\n141\n00:07:59.262 --> 00:08:00.849\nAny kind of remote logging and\n\n142\n00:08:00.849 --> 00:08:04.160\nmonitoring data that you may\nhave accumulated along the way.\n\n143\n00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.477\nAlso any kind of Physical\nconfigurations and network topology,\n\n144\n00:08:07.477 --> 00:08:10.200\nall the way down to physical\nconfigurations oops.\n\n145\n00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.210\nThat one should be removable\narchivable media so\n\n146\n00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.370\nthat things like sorry let me go ahead and\nchange that here.\n\n147\n00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.880\nSo any kind of.\n\n148\n00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:25.060\n&gt;&gt; CDs and even network documentation\nin itself is what we're also seeing.\n\n149\n00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.560\nThe goal is simple, we know that what\nwe can do is we can those CDs and\n\n150\n00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:34.630\nput them in a poll and as long as\nthey are not sitting in the sun or\n\n151\n00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.450\nput them on or under something.\n\n152\n00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.140\nWhat I like with the data is\ngonna be therefore to examine\n\n153\n00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.731\neven over a long period of time.\n\n154\n00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:42.520\nBurt stuff that's actually in RAM,\n\n155\n00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.930\njust like we were seeing a pillar\nnear the top of the pyramid.\n\n156\n00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.120\nWell remember that that's actually\ndone by the idea of volatility here in\n\n157\n00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.630\nterms of electricity.\n\n158\n00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.680\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nIf somebody comes in and\n\n159\n00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.720\njust pulls out the plug\n&gt;&gt; It's lost.\n\n160\n00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.270\n&gt;&gt; It's lost.\n\n161\n00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.140\nIt's gone, and that's something that\nwe actually have to worry about.\n\n162\n00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.910\nWhat we might say is when we\nstart gathering evidence,\n\n163\n00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.280\nwe need to make sure we get\nthat most important data,\n\n164\n00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:08.330\njust in case a power outage goes out\nwhile I'm trying to collect the data.\n\n165\n00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.220\nI wanna get all that stuff in.\n\n166\n00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.610\n&gt;&gt; Or they cut the power,\nthe attacker, exactly.\n\n167\n00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:11.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, or cuts the power.\n\n168\n00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.920\nSo very important process here, okay.\n\n169\n00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.800\nNow Cherokee, anything else we need to\nunderstand about the order of volatility\n\n170\n00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.860\nbefore we take a look\nat another phase here?\n\n171\n00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.820\n&gt;&gt; I think it's also important to\nnote that this information that you\n\n172\n00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:30.880\nare collecting you're actually never going\nto be analyzing the original data itself.\n\n173\n00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.030\nIt's very important you always wanna\nmake sure you're always making\n\n174\n00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:37.160\ncopies of information before\nyou actually analyze it.\n\n175\n00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.510\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee, why is that so\nimportant what is it about the process\n\n176\n00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:44.860\nwhen we go through the analysis that we\nneed to actually look at a copy instead of\n\n177\n00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.340\nactually working directly\nwith the original evidence.\n\n178\n00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.220\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and that's exactly because\nyou don't want to manipulate\n\n179\n00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.670\nthe original information,\nthe original evidence.\n\n180\n00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:58.280\nSo your opposing counsel will request\na copy of all evidence has to be submitted\n\n181\n00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.180\nbefore court unless it's something that's\njust found, but you should go ahead and\n\n182\n00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.710\ngive them a copy of the information\nthat you intend to analyze.\n\n183\n00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:09.510\nYou yourself get a copy and\nthat's what you will be working with.\n\n184\n00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.800\nNot the original system,\nthe original equipment.\n\n185\n00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.700\nWhich it can be a kind of rough for\n\n186\n00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.380\nsmaller companies if it's like a mum and\npop shop.\n\n187\n00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.540\nAnd you're essentially\nseizing their equipment, and\n\n188\n00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.140\nnow they're left unoperational, but that's\nkind of a decision that you have to make\n\n189\n00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:29.270\nat that point if you plan on actually\ntrying to prosecute that attacker.\n\n190\n00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:32.560\n&gt;&gt; So Cherokee,\nwhat's the best way that we can make\n\n191\n00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.280\nlike the copy that you're talking about?\n\n192\n00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.550\nSo let's say, like your example there,\nwhere you seize somebody's computer and\n\n193\n00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.810\nessentially all the data's\nrolling on the hard drive itself.\n\n194\n00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.750\nWhat is it that we could\ndo because I can't just go,\n\n195\n00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.340\nhere's a copy the hard drive and\nhand that over to\n\n196\n00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.170\nwhoever's gonna be maybe the defense\nat this point cuz I don't have a copy.\n\n197\n00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.920\nWhat can I do to relief?\n\n198\n00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.530\nMake that happen.\n\n199\n00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:57.160\n&gt;&gt; Right, so there are a lot of\ndifferent forensic toolkits out there.\n\n200\n00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.180\nAnd if we look at my screen here, I have\na list of some recommended software.\n\n201\n00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:06.170\nAnd this is specifically extracted\nfrom that RFC that I had showed you.\n\n202\n00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.420\nThey give some categories tha\nwe want to think about here.\n\n203\n00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.270\nWhat was I gonna say here?\n\n204\n00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.230\nI was gonna say our networking also.\n\n205\n00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:18.870\nIt's not called out within this RFC but\nyou do want to make sure\n\n206\n00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:22.590\nyou are also monitoring your logs and\nkeeping that information as well.\n\n207\n00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.620\nSo you're using the software, and\nyou might want to have a program for\n\n208\n00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.030\nexamining processes, okay?\n\n209\n00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.750\nThey give us an example here for PS.\n\n210\n00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:33.560\nI'm sure if you guys did an online search\nyou could find some more up to date,\n\n211\n00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.110\nI'm not sure what year this document\nwas out but it's been a little bit.\n\n212\n00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.830\nPrograms for examining system state.\n\n213\n00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.930\nSuch as, and we have some also\nbuilt-in command line utilities here.\n\n214\n00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:47.120\nIt doesn't necessarily have to be\na third party piece of software.\n\n215\n00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.680\nA program for doing bit-to-bit copies.\n\n216\n00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.170\nAnd that's really key here, because you\nwant to really have a great granular level\n\n217\n00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:58.950\nof this data examined at\nthat really low level.\n\n218\n00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:03.330\nAnd it's also important\nthe RFC calls out I think\n\n219\n00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.760\nit was in the RFC recommended which\nI thought was a really great idea.\n\n220\n00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.950\nIf you already know your environment and\nyour network you might want to go ahead.\n\n221\n00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.880\nYou should have these tools on hand for\neach type of operating system that you\n\n222\n00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.890\nhave within your environment so you're\nprepared for these types of situations and\n\n223\n00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:24.302\nyou're not scrambling at the last minute\nto try to find them also, all right.\n\n224\n00:12:24.302 --> 00:12:29.240\nUtilizing a piece of software to\ngenerate checksums and signatures,\n\n225\n00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.940\nwhich I'll come back to here in a moment.\n\n226\n00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:35.380\nA program for generating core and\nmidges, and for examining them.\n\n227\n00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.340\nAnd then also scripts to\nautomate evidence collection.\n\n228\n00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.377\nYeah.\nSo we'll look at why hashes in a few\n\n229\n00:12:41.377 --> 00:12:46.880\nmoments, and I'll explain what a hash is\nso important in this particular situation.\n\n230\n00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.260\n&gt;&gt; So Cherokee as we go back to\nthe scenario that we were talking about\n\n231\n00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.410\nearlier, what if I do have a hard drive,\n\n232\n00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.850\nwhat type of software are we looking at,\nor\n\n233\n00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:57.529\nhow do I actually make sure that everybody\ncan get a copy of what they need.\n\n234\n00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:04.240\n&gt;&gt; So that should be held, that process,\nwith your legal teams, I would assume.\n\n235\n00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.080\nIs that what you're asking, Ronnie,\nif I have some kind of legal advice?\n\n236\n00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.240\n&gt;&gt; Well, it's not the idea of\nlegal advice, right, as so\n\n237\n00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.230\nmuch that what we really need\nto ensure for both sides\n\n238\n00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:17.750\nis that they literally have what the exact\nsame copy of the hard drive itself.\n\n239\n00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.710\nAnd when we start to work with things\nlike that, what you're gonna end up\n\n240\n00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.950\nfinding out is you're gonna use some\ntype of really imaging software,\n\n241\n00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:28.640\nthat really does create that bit by\nbit copy of that hard drive, and\n\n242\n00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.320\nthen what you can do for\nthe legal team is simple.\n\n243\n00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.360\nIf both sides need to examine it,\nyou can create what we call an image,\n\n244\n00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.500\nand then you can take that image and\nput it down on another hard drive.\n\n245\n00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.720\nAnd that way the original is\nnot gonna be tampered with.\n\n246\n00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.530\nAnd then you can hand that over for\nthe evidence to help them out.\n\n247\n00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.120\nAnd that way they have an idea\nwhat's going on inside of this.\n\n248\n00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.075\nBecause without that idea that\nmeans that somebody can, I don't\n\n249\n00:13:54.075 --> 00:13:57.195\nwanna say accuse you, but they can say,\nhow do I know you didn't tamper with it.\n\n250\n00:13:57.195 --> 00:14:00.455\n&gt;&gt; Yeah totally, and they're gonna be\nlooking for any kind of rebuttal, or\n\n251\n00:14:00.455 --> 00:14:03.105\nsay look,\nRonnie you messed with this evidence, and\n\n252\n00:14:03.105 --> 00:14:07.155\nif we look at my screen here, what you\nwanna do to that particular image that\n\n253\n00:14:07.155 --> 00:14:09.975\nyou've generated is go ahead and\nrun a hash on it.\n\n254\n00:14:09.975 --> 00:14:14.510\nAnd one more thing real quick before\nwe explain hashes and get into all that\n\n255\n00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:17.970\nI do want to say, another thing when your\nlooking at different types of programs,\n\n256\n00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:22.850\nyou also want to be cognizant\nof not running software\n\n257\n00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:27.470\nthat can actually modify access times,\nsuch as Tar or Xcopy.\n\n258\n00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.490\nEven in kind of those\nintegrated command lines\n\n259\n00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:35.260\nbecause you don't want to override\nthat access log information there.\n\n260\n00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.330\nSo just keep that in mind as well.\n\n261\n00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.720\nAnd so yeah so Ronnie like you\nwere saying about the images.\n\n262\n00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:46.410\nWell if what's to say,\nwho's to say that if I generate and\n\n263\n00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.360\ngive you this hard disk drive\nmaybe I have my attorneys.\n\n264\n00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.830\nNormally both parties want\nto be present while that\n\n265\n00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:56.920\nprocess is going you have a representative\nfrom your opposing counsel and so forth.\n\n266\n00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.260\nAnd so\nthey can make sure that you followed\n\n267\n00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.810\nthe correct procedure step by step\nhere and haven't tampered with it.\n\n268\n00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:07.420\nAnd what I'm gonna say to you is\nhey look we're gonna go ahead and\n\n269\n00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:12.300\nuse a particular hash algorithm okay,\nand generate a hash value.\n\n270\n00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:16.150\nSo if we look at my screen here there\nare actually several different names here.\n\n271\n00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.730\nAnd I pulled these different names\nfrom Bruce Schneider's book,\n\n272\n00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.260\nApplied Cryptography, love that book.\n\n273\n00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:27.420\nWe have compression function,\ncontraction function, message digest, that\n\n274\n00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:32.010\none's really common, all right it also is\nsometimes called a fingerprint because it\n\n275\n00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:37.030\nshould be unique to a particular\ncombination of data string of data, right.\n\n276\n00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.370\nIt should be unique,\nshould been the keyword there.\n\n277\n00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:44.230\nAnd we will look at that, cryptographic\nchecksum, message integrity check for\n\n278\n00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.230\nMIC, and manipulation detection code.\n\n279\n00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:49.250\nNow for this it's good to know this,\n\n280\n00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.910\nI don't think that there are gonna be\ncalling all of those out on the exams\n\n281\n00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.510\nspecifically, I just wanted to show you\nthere a lot of different names here.\n\n282\n00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.748\nSo yeah and if we look at this example.\n\n283\n00:15:58.748 --> 00:16:04.161\nNow this is not going to be any\nkind of intricate algorithm okay?\n\n284\n00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:06.767\nBut I just want to give you\nthe basic concept here.\n\n285\n00:16:06.767 --> 00:16:12.492\nSo I have this statement here so\nI just said that your hash algorithm or\n\n286\n00:16:12.492 --> 00:16:17.720\nyour hash value should be\nunique per binary string, okay?\n\n287\n00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:23.840\nSo if this sentence here, I should be\nable to generate a unique hash value.\n\n288\n00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.170\nIf I use this algorithm,\nall right, very rudimentary here.\n\n289\n00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:33.110\nWords multiplied by the number\nof characters in this sentence,\n\n290\n00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.490\nthis should generate our hash value.\n\n291\n00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:39.600\nSo Ronnie, if we look at that here,\nall right, how many words do we have?\n\n292\n00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.210\n&gt;&gt;

Looks good.\n\n300\n00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:10.451\n&gt;&gt; All right, all right, 3 times 12 is?\n\n301\n00:17:10.451 --> 00:17:11.518\n&gt;&gt; 36.\n\n302\n00:17:11.518 --> 00:17:12.481\n&gt;&gt; 36.\n\n303\n00:17:12.481 --> 00:17:14.904\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Our hash value message digest,\n\n304\n00:17:14.904 --> 00:17:17.970\nwhatever one of these\nterms you wanna call it.\n\n305\n00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.800\nAll right,\nthis should be our unique hash value.\n\n306\n00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.820\nNow what if I go ahead and\nswitch it up a little bit.\n\n307\n00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:29.871\nLet's take this same algorithm and\napply it to a new string of data.\n\n308\n00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.370\nAll right, same algorithm, all right.\n\n309\n00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.008\nWords times character to\ngenerate our hash value.\n\n310\n00:17:39.008 --> 00:17:44.870\nI haven't changed much so am I gonna\nbe getting a different hash value here?\n\n311\n00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.700\nNo, it's gonna come out the same,\nright, Ronnie.\n\n312\n00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.280\nSo that's a problem.\n\n313\n00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.650\nAll right, that's called a hash collision.\n\n314\n00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:56.460\nAnd it might not seem\nlike a big deal here, but\n\n315\n00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.980\nlet's see Alice and Bob,\nthose are our dramatis persona.\n\n316\n00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.390\nIf you're not familiar with them,\nokay, you should go ahead and\n\n317\n00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:04.040\ntake a look at that.\n\n318\n00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.966\nThey're just names that you'll see being\nused commonly in security documentation.\n\n319\n00:18:07.966 --> 00:18:11.380\nSo let's say Alice and\n\n320\n00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:16.560\nBob are trying to come up with just\nsome sort of contract, all right?\n\n321\n00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:21.560\nAnd Alice gets Bob to go ahead and\nsign this document that has a hash,\n\n322\n00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.120\nthat has been generated.\n\n323\n00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.590\nBut let's say Alice has\nsome ulterior motives, and\n\n324\n00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:34.390\nperhaps the protocol that was used,\nBob only signs actual hash value.\n\n325\n00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:40.240\nNow if Alice can go back and\nmanipulate this document to generate,\n\n326\n00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:46.870\nall right, this same hash value, that hash\ncollision, the document that Bob signed,\n\n327\n00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.300\nhe might have thought it was\na favorable document for him, but\n\n328\n00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.060\nshe could've just bankrupted him\nat that particular situation.\n\n329\n00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:56.700\nA lot of different password\ndatabases utilize hash values to\n\n330\n00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.750\nstore the actual password information\ninstead of storing an actual password.\n\n331\n00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.799\nSo you see these types of attacks.\n\n332\n00:19:02.799 --> 00:19:06.150\nYou see hashes being used for integrity.\n\n333\n00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.710\nSo if CompTIA were to ask you,\na hash value is going to verify,\n\n334\n00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:13.960\nlike Ronnie was saying, for that hard disc\ndrive, that that information is in fact,\n\n335\n00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.350\nit hasn't been manipulated.\n\n336\n00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:19.020\nBecause in theory,\nif that data had been manipulated,\n\n337\n00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.320\nthen that hash value would be different.\n\n338\n00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.240\n&gt;&gt; So Cherokee, what we're saying here,\nright, is that we take whatever\n\n339\n00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.450\nthe hashing algorithm is and\nwe run it against the original hard drive.\n\n340\n00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:33.280\nAnd then we also run that same value\nagainst one of those copies of the drive.\n\n341\n00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.070\nAnd what should happen is that\nthey should be identical.\n\n342\n00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:40.522\nIf there is a change between any one of\nthem, such as the original and the copy,\n\n343\n00:19:40.522 --> 00:19:44.707\nwe know that somewhere along in the line\nwe are missing some information or\n\n344\n00:19:44.707 --> 00:19:46.818\nsome information has been added in.\n\n345\n00:19:46.818 --> 00:19:50.994\nAnd so this way, by ensuring once we\nactually create that type of what we call\n\n346\n00:19:50.994 --> 00:19:53.803\nsystem imaging software\nto create that image, and\n\n347\n00:19:53.803 --> 00:19:56.450\nwe put it back down on to that hard drive.\n\n348\n00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:00.510\nWe wanna make sure that that's how both\nsides know that they're getting an exact\n\n349\n00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:03.250\ncopy of whatever the original was.\n\n350\n00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:06.370\nBecause that's where all\nthe evidence is really gonna reside,\n\n351\n00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:09.040\nespecially like in the scenario\nthat we are talking about, okay.\n\n352\n00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:09.760\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n353\n00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.400\n&gt;&gt; Now, Cherokee,\n\n354\n00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.040\nwhat are some other things that we have\nto consider when we talk about the other\n\n355\n00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.440\nparts of the forensic process?\n\n356\n00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.110\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nSo\n\n357\n00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:18.040\nyou have to think about the actual\nphysical environment as well.\n\n358\n00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.420\nSo you want to go ahead,\nif at all possible,\n\n359\n00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.550\ngo ahead and record this process.\n\n360\n00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:27.510\nI mean, most people have access to\nvideo cameras even in smartphones.\n\n361\n00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:32.850\nAnd the reason being is you might feel\nlike you have a photographic memory but\n\n362\n00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:38.078\nsometimes you may be called to testify\nmonths, even years after the fact.\n\n363\n00:20:38.078 --> 00:20:41.472\nSo you wanna make sure you\nhave accurate information so\n\n364\n00:20:41.472 --> 00:20:45.324\nyou're not trying to fill in any\ngaps there with your memory.\n\n365\n00:20:45.324 --> 00:20:48.789\nYou also wanna take a look\nat perhaps that entity,\n\n366\n00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:54.275\nthe facility has a security cameras,\nlike a closed caption TV system.\n\n367\n00:20:54.275 --> 00:20:58.665\nAnd that information can also be used as\nevidence.They say a picture is worth 1,000\n\n368\n00:20:58.665 --> 00:21:00.481\nwords, so what is a video worth, right?\n\n369\n00:21:00.481 --> 00:21:04.585\nSo let's go ahead and use that to\nour advantage and see if perhaps\n\n370\n00:21:04.585 --> 00:21:08.840\nthat camera footage has caught anything\nthat we can use in a court of law.\n\n371\n00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:13.010\nAlso you wanna go ahead and\nnote who was around at the time,\n\n372\n00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:16.910\nwhat they were doing,\nif there were any witnesses available.\n\n373\n00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:19.740\nAnd here's the thing with that,\nand like we said before,\n\n374\n00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:23.030\nthat opposing counsel is going to try\nto discredit you in any potential way.\n\n375\n00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:28.820\nSo you wanna make sure that your\nwitness is a good fit for your outcome.\n\n376\n00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.060\nYou don't wanna lead\nyour witness in anyway.\n\n377\n00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:32.403\nThat's illegal, right?\n\n378\n00:21:32.403 --> 00:21:32.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n379\n00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:37.310\nwe wanna make sure we are still\ncomplying to those guidelines as well.\n\n380\n00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.460\nYou yourself will probably\nbe called as a witness,\n\n381\n00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.220\nan expert witness,\nif in fact you are a forensic examiner.\n\n382\n00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.190\nYou should always track man hours and\nexpenses.\n\n383\n00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:54.150\nNumber one, that attacker, if convicted,\nthey may be required to go ahead and\n\n384\n00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:55.680\npay restitution.\n\n385\n00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.680\nNumber two, during your company or\norganization's risk analysis,\n\n386\n00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:06.710\nthey take this information and see hey,\nhow long did Ronnie spend examining and\n\n387\n00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:09.450\ninvestigating this\nincident from last year?\n\n388\n00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:14.390\nOkay, so let's say it was ooku bucks,\nthen they take that ooku buck amount and\n\n389\n00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:18.880\nthen compare it to the potential\nsecurity control that they might\n\n390\n00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.370\nwant to implement and they can see\nif it's a good decision there.\n\n391\n00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:28.050\nBag and tag, chain of custody.\n\n392\n00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:30.640\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n393\n00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.600\nThis is a term that was\nborrowed from law enforcement.\n\n394\n00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.010\nAnd while we're collecting this evidence,\n\n395\n00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:42.130\nanother important factor is we don't want\nit to fall into the wrong hands until\n\n396\n00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:47.610\nthe actual time of presentation,\nokay, so court.\n\n397\n00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:52.457\nWhenever that evidence has been collected,\nwe need to have a timeline.\n\n398\n00:22:52.457 --> 00:22:55.347\nWe have to account for\nwhere it is at all times,\n\n399\n00:22:55.347 --> 00:23:00.017\nwho is in charge of this evidence,\nand it should include where, when, and\n\n400\n00:23:00.017 --> 00:23:03.300\nby whom the evidence was discovered and\ncollected.\n\n401\n00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:06.680\nAnd again,\nI pulled these facts off the RFC so\n\n402\n00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.910\nthis is as legit as you\ncan get right here.\n\n403\n00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:14.910\nWhere and when and by whom\nthe evidence was handled or examined?\n\n404\n00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.680\nWho had custody of the evidence\nduring what period?\n\n405\n00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.740\nHow was it stored?\n\n406\n00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.150\nWhen the evidence changed custody.\n\n407\n00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:25.645\nWhen and how did the transfer occur\nincluding any kind of shipping,\n\n408\n00:23:25.645 --> 00:23:27.370\nmainly tracking numbers and so forth.\n\n409\n00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:31.110\nYou just always wanna make sure\nthat only authorized personnel\n\n410\n00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.180\nhad access to this documentation.\n\n411\n00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.810\nYou also wanna make sure that it\nwas stored in tamper-proof evidence\n\n412\n00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:41.730\nbags that might even have ES antistatic\nbags, ESD bags, something like that,\n\n413\n00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:44.340\njust to make sure that evidence,\nthat's precious.\n\n414\n00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:47.280\nYou gotta keep it safe until\nthe actual litigation.\n\n415\n00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is a very important\npart of this process in terms of\n\n416\n00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:52.800\nunderstanding the forensic nature of this.\n\n417\n00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.727\nWhat we don't want is that there is a gap\nhere in the timeline of who's had custody\n\n418\n00:23:57.727 --> 00:24:01.363\nfrom it from the time of gather,\nI should say, not from it.\n\n419\n00:24:01.363 --> 00:24:06.365\nBut so as soon as it's gathered,\nthere has to be a marked chain of custody\n\n420\n00:24:06.365 --> 00:24:11.695\nwhich shows that you somehow have\nactually known Who's been responsible for\n\n421\n00:24:11.695 --> 00:24:16.730\nwhat particular length of time and\nalso at anytime along the way.\n\n422\n00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:20.270\nThat evidence has been handled\nexactly the way that needs to.\n\n423\n00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:25.590\nWithout that, anybody can then come around\nand say well, look here it was we don't\n\n424\n00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:29.360\nknow where it was from this particular\npoint in time to this point in time.\n\n425\n00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.280\nIt's somebody have manipulated and\nchanged that, to now where,\n\n426\n00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.690\nsomebody could have actually been\nincriminating my client instead.\n\n427\n00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:40.810\nSo the chain of custody, especially in\nthe forensic process, is really key.\n\n428\n00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:43.430\nMissing chain of custody\nevidence is enough,\n\n429\n00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:48.420\nto essentially get that entire case not\nto the point where you want it to go,\n\n430\n00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:51.500\nif you're actually the one\ntrying to do the prosecution.\n\n431\n00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.046\nSo we wanna make sure that\nthat's always an important part.\n\n432\n00:24:54.046 --> 00:24:58.350\nNow Cherokee, we also wanna\nmentioned the idea here of taking\n\n433\n00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:02.610\na note here of what we call\nthe time offsets on things too.\n\n434\n00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:05.840\nSo Cherokee, why do we have to note\nthe idea we have time offsets.\n\n435\n00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.080\n&gt;&gt; Sure Ronnie that's\na really good question.\n\n436\n00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:14.520\nSo it's important to note that UTC time is\nusually based off the Greenwich Meridian\n\n437\n00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:19.490\nand NTFS utilises that time zone but\ndepending on what region\n\n438\n00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:23.470\nyou're in you need to go ahead and record\nthat time offset, the difference there.\n\n439\n00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:27.960\nBecause your local systems\nshould be using that local time.\n\n440\n00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.100\nAnd another thing that\nyou should also note,\n\n441\n00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:34.380\nthat if there is any kind of\ndifferences within your network time.\n\n442\n00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:39.680\nSo if there are any offsets between the\nactual systems within your environment,\n\n443\n00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.470\nthat should be noted as well.\n\n444\n00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:45.720\nWe don't want to go ahead and\nshow that security footage and\n\n445\n00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.940\nhave that time be off in the security\nfootage, and the posing council say\n\n446\n00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.920\nthat doesn't jive with what you're\nsaying and you don't want to give them\n\n447\n00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:58.480\nany kind of gaps or holes, you want to be\nconsistent, and as accurate as possible.\n\n448\n00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.110\nAnd that's another thing just try\nto be as detailed as you can.\n\n449\n00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:05.840\nIf you think you're being overly\ndetailed there, you're probably not.\n\n450\n00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.730\nAnd also, you wanna remain objective.\n\n451\n00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:14.240\nYou never wanna insert any\nkind of opinions, facts only.\n\n452\n00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.910\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n453\n00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:21.090\nAnd we can look at some legal\nconsiderations, that we must consider.\n\n454\n00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.250\nAnd some terms that are pretty\nimportant here also, so admissible.\n\n455\n00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.730\nThis term means that it\nmust conform to certain\n\n456\n00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:32.750\nlegal rules before it can\nbe put forth in a court.\n\n457\n00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:37.180\nSo for example, here in Florida it's\nillegal to go ahead and record someone\n\n458\n00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.640\nwithout their knowledge, like if I were\ntalking to you Ronnie on the phone and\n\n459\n00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.270\nI'm just recording you,\nI can't use that as evidence.\n\n460\n00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:45.940\nIt's actually a felony for\nme to even do so.\n\n461\n00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.930\nSo you could be getting yourself into\ntrouble and you don't want that to happen.\n\n462\n00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.630\nYou wanna make sure you're\nin compliance with those.\n\n463\n00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.440\nOkay, authentic,\n\n464\n00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:58.670\nit must be possible to positively tie\nevidentiary material to the incident.\n\n465\n00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:01.100\nYou're not making anything up here, right?\n\n466\n00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.090\nYou need to make sure that it's complete.\n\n467\n00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:07.130\nThat's why that forensics report\nshould be so detailed here.\n\n468\n00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:11.440\nIt must tell the whole story and\nnot just a particular perspective.\n\n469\n00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.480\nIt should be reliable,\n\n470\n00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:16.350\nthere must be nothing about how the\nevidence was collected that subsequently\n\n471\n00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:20.900\nhandled that casts doubt about\nit's authenticity and veracity.\n\n472\n00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.010\nThat's why, all right, we see that that\n\n473\n00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.680\nparticular chain of custody being so\nessential here, okay.\n\n474\n00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.090\nAnd then lastly believable.\n\n475\n00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:35.440\nIt must be readily believable and\nunderstandable by a court.\n\n476\n00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.520\nAnd the other thing is depending on\nwhatever software you use to go ahead and\n\n477\n00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.060\nanalyse these systems.\n\n478\n00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:45.650\nYou should also be confident enough in\nthat software to be able to testify it if\n\n479\n00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:47.830\nyou brought on stand as well.\n\n480\n00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:53.930\nSo, yeah and then lastly,\nwe hear this term Ronnie big data.\n\n481\n00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:55.325\nWell, what is big data?\n\n482\n00:27:55.325 --> 00:27:59.430\n[LAUGH] Have you ever\nheard of frog watch USA?\n\n483\n00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:00.648\n&gt;&gt; No, I have not.\n\n484\n00:28:00.648 --> 00:28:02.470\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I, like you,\n\n485\n00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:07.900\nhad not heard about it until last year,\nwhen my son had a project to go ahead and\n\n486\n00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:11.080\nrecord Wetland information, okay.\n\n487\n00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.010\n&gt;&gt; This has been going on for\nyears, Ronnie.\n\n488\n00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:14.950\nI couldn't even tell you.\n\n489\n00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:19.240\nWe have the scientists, students,\nteachers, volunteers, whomever,\n\n490\n00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:23.120\ngoing to record wetland information and\ninput it into a database.\n\n491\n00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:30.328\nSo for years, okay, something like 15\nyears, there has been this organization.\n\n492\n00:28:30.328 --> 00:28:33.770\nAccumulating what information.\n\n493\n00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:38.700\nThat is one tiny little spec in our\nworld of data that's being accumulated.\n\n494\n00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.250\nWe have sensors out in\nthe ocean to go ahead and\n\n495\n00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:47.360\nrecord seismic activity to predict any\nkind of earthquake and things like that.\n\n496\n00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.830\nWhat are we doing with all this data\nnow that it's been accumulated?\n\n497\n00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:55.190\nWho is managing it, how are we storing it,\nall of the different traffic\n\n498\n00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:58.920\nlights that are recording, intersections,\nthe cameras that we have there?\n\n499\n00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:03.695\nSo big data okay, and it's kind\nof becoming a problem because now\n\n500\n00:29:03.695 --> 00:29:06.785\nwe have to look at these\nretention policies.\n\n501\n00:29:06.785 --> 00:29:11.495\nCertain entities will require you to\ngo ahead and retain this information,\n\n502\n00:29:11.495 --> 00:29:13.615\nto archive it for\na certain amount of time.\n\n503\n00:29:13.615 --> 00:29:19.830\nSo, what if the database that\nhouses all this accumulated data.\n\n504\n00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:23.340\nHas suffered from a breach, okay.\n\n505\n00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:27.340\nThat's gonna be a little tricky there,\nit's gonna be in its own realm.\n\n506\n00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:31.330\nThe forensic tools that we might\nuse on our client stations or\n\n507\n00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:36.070\neven network servers.\n\n508\n00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:39.388\nThose should not be\nthe same type of tools.\n\n509\n00:29:39.388 --> 00:29:44.440\nWe would wanna go ahead and utilize\ndata visualization tools because when\n\n510\n00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:49.850\nwe're dealing with that large amount\nof raw data, it can be difficult for\n\n511\n00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:56.080\na human to extrapolate the relationships\nwith certain entries of that database.\n\n512\n00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:00.050\nSo by introducing visual aids,\n\n513\n00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:04.650\nwe can find those correlations and\nhave it displayed graphically for us.\n\n514\n00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:09.140\nAnd that's what you'll wanna look\nat if in fact you do have big\n\n515\n00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.440\ndata within your environment you should\nbe prepared for that to know look, there\n\n516\n00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:17.120\nare a couple of extra steps that I need\nto do for this particular system here.\n\n517\n00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.640\n&gt;&gt; There is no doubt that in\nterms of big data what we\n\n518\n00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.100\nare actually pretty much\nseeing that there is so\n\n519\n00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.430\nmuch data that is being generated\n&gt;&gt; That's it's very difficult to\n\n520\n00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:29.800\neven spot things like trends\nthat you might end up seeing,\n\n521\n00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:35.260\ncorrelation of values, whatever\npreferences are that might be there.\n\n522\n00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.090\nAnd that's what your looking for as well.\n\n523\n00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:41.510\nIt's not just the very fact that there is\ninformation that you have to scan thru,\n\n524\n00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:44.700\nbut that there's information in which you\nneed to make some type of correlation and\n\n525\n00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.070\nanalysis with.\n\n526\n00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:48.800\nTo be able to prove\nthe points that you need to.\n\n527\n00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.590\nSo it's very easy then for\n\n528\n00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:56.015\nme if I wanted to commit let's say an act\nof criminality which I don't want to do.\n\n529\n00:30:56.015 --> 00:30:59.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; To say instead Cherokee here it is.\n\n530\n00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:02.330\nHere's 42 terabytes of data, okay.\n\n531\n00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:06.540\nYou requested the information and\nI'll give you all 42 terabytes of it.\n\n532\n00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:09.885\nAnd in that sense,\nthat could take a long time for\n\n533\n00:31:09.885 --> 00:31:14.050\nCherokee regardless of how many machines\nthat she is using to walk through and\n\n534\n00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:17.200\nactually examine every\nsingle record of that data.\n\n535\n00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.750\nBig data analytics for\nanalysis gives us those tools,\n\n536\n00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:26.000\nto be able instead to spot those\ntrans among trillions of records and\n\n537\n00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.150\nmaybe those spot patterns and\ncorrelation that you and I.\n\n538\n00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:33.130\nMay not be able to make\nthe logical jump too, but\n\n539\n00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:36.300\nthe very fact is that this\ntype of data analysis can.\n\n540\n00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:40.130\nAnd that can be very important\nas well if you do run into those\n\n541\n00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:41.950\nsituation where this comes into play.\n\n542\n00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:44.810\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Ranny, if you're talking terabytes\nand you also would wanna go ahead and\n\n543\n00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:46.910\nlook at that network traffic logs as well,\n\n544\n00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:50.230\nbecause if someone's siphoning that\ninformation we're talking terabytes,\n\n545\n00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:54.670\nyou're gonna see that coming across your\nnetworks so just think about that as well.\n\n546\n00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:57.500\nAll right, so there's a lot of\ndifferent procedures here that you\n\n547\n00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:02.250\ndo need to make sure you work through when\ngetting ready for that comp tia exam.\n\n548\n00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:06.050\nAnd so Cherokee's actually introduced\nus to a lot of the different concepts.\n\n549\n00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:08.910\nThose important concepts of course\nare actually going to be there\n\n550\n00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:10.660\nthat you'll find out on the exam.\n\n551\n00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:14.360\nBut you'll also see it as you enter into\nthe world as a security professional.\n\n552\n00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:18.220\nBecause it may be required of you one\nday to at least understand the basic\n\n553\n00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.870\nprocedures, and you might be wanna,\nam I gonna be doing this?\n\n554\n00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:24.292\nIt's possible, but the very fact is so,\nthat you don't mess it up.\n\n555\n00:32:24.292 --> 00:32:26.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; More than anything else.\n\n556\n00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:30.350\nIt's very easy to walk in on a situation\nand say, we need to seize that particular\n\n557\n00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:35.120\nperson's computer Well, one of the initial\nreactions, right, if somebody's committing\n\n558\n00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:39.820\nsome type of act of fraud or crime and\nwe actually are catching them in the act,\n\n559\n00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:44.060\nto just simply what, yank that laptop or\nthat desktop away from them.\n\n560\n00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:47.740\nAnd literally unplug the computer, when\na lot of the information that they were\n\n561\n00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:50.040\ndoing right then could have\nactually been right in RAM.\n\n562\n00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:53.880\nSo understanding procedures that we've\ngone over here is gonna be very important\n\n563\n00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.160\nto understand the very basics.\n\n564\n00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.310\nSo thank you Cherokee for\n\n565\n00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:01.170\nhelping us to understand at least the very\nbasics here and thank you also for\n\n566\n00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:06.390\nwatching us today as well here for the\nCompTIA Security+ Shell signing off for\n\n567\n00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:09.520\nITProTV, I've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n568\n00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.550\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:41,920\nWelcome back to ITPro TV, as we continue\non in our security plus series here.\n\n4\n00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,710\nWe are reshooting this because of\nthe newer exam objectives that are coming\n\n5\n00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,660\nalong here.\n\n6\n00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,940\nI'll be your host today.\n\n7\n00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,030\nMy name is Ronnie Wong.\n\n8\n00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,640\nAnd I am here with Mr Nate Copeland.\n\n9\n00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,780\nHow's it going Nate.\n\n10\n00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,010\n>> Yeah, it's going well.\n\n11\n00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:55,930\nIt's going well today.\n\n12\n00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,961\nWe've got an exciting show lined up today,\nwith some more security plus stuff.\n\n13\n00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:03,670\nWe're going to get into some of that\nchange management, and you know what?\n\n14\n00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,477\nWe can just take a look at\nthe official exam objectives,\n\n15\n00:01:06,477 --> 00:01:09,160\nrather than trying to\nhash the whole thing out.\n\n16\n00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,730\n>> All right, yeah.\n\n17\n00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,879\n>> So, we're gonna be covering\nthree little subtopics, right?\n\n18\n00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:16,302\nSo we've got, first off, we'll have 2.3.\n\n19\n00:01:16,302 --> 00:01:20,890\nAll right, given a scenario, implement\nappropriate risk mitigation strategies.\n\n20\n00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,719\nThen we've got 2.4 today,\nimplement basic forensic procedures.\n\n21\n00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:31,804\nAnd then third and last,\nwe'll have down here at 2.9.\n\n22\n00:01:31,804 --> 00:01:37,410\nGiven a scenario, select appropriate\ncontrol to meet the goals of security.\n\n23\n00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:40,300\n>> Yeah, so when we thing about this,\nright, these are actually different\n\n24\n00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,100\nsecurity contexts in which you,\nas an IT security professional,\n\n25\n00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,440\nwill at least need to understand how we\nimplement the practices that we need to.\n\n26\n00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,980\nUnderstand the context in\nwhich we put them in as well.\n\n27\n00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,120\nAnd so you actually see where the exam\nobjectives call it the idea of a given\n\n28\n00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,100\nscenario.\n\n29\n00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,200\nFor us, we wanna put in those different\nelements that we've been talking about\n\n30\n00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,250\nduring our show, and some new ones that\nyou'll also learn about as you continue on\n\n31\n00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,960\nthrough your studies here,\ninto the proper context.\n\n32\n00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,730\nAnd that's a part of what we do,\nin terms of IT security for us,\n\n33\n00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,350\nwhen we get started.\n\n34\n00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:16,960\nSo that is where we're actually taking\nthe show today as we continue on here.\n\n35\n00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,206\nSo, the easiest way for us is that we just\nkind of took those particular topics and\n\n36\n00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:21,350\nwe put them together.\n\n37\n00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,205\nBecause they all did just call out the\nidea of given different scenarios here,\n\n38\n00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:26,510\nand so we grouped them into\nthe different contexts, and\n\n39\n00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,260\nthat's the way that we chose to do it.\n\n40\n00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,850\nSo Nate, what is our first context\nthat we're taking a look at here?\n\n41\n00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,090\n>> All right, we had to start off, we'd\nget into the idea of change management.\n\n42\n00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,370\nNow change management, the whole goal\nof change management is to reduce\n\n43\n00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,750\nthe risk of a change impacting some\nkind of system, or some kind of thing.\n\n44\n00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,000\nAnd so we regulate changes\nmade to systems, so we can\n\n45\n00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,300\nmake sure it doesn't bring anything down,\nor have any kind of unforeseen problems.\n\n46\n00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,730\nEvery once in a while,\nthings will happen in which I may go in,\n\n47\n00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,750\nespecially on our network here, and\nthink, hey, I'll just readjust this.\n\n48\n00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,580\nNot realizing the changes,\nor that one change, and\n\n49\n00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,870\nwhat it could affect later on here.\n\n50\n00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,740\nSo, it could be that,\neven though I made that one change,\n\n51\n00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,950\nthat somewhere down the line that change\nactually had a kinda drastic effect.\n\n52\n00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,130\nSo let me give you a real world scenario\nof what actually happened one day.\n\n53\n00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:25,740\nOkay?\n\n54\n00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,900\nSo, we were in the midst of trying to\nput together our web security package,\n\n55\n00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,920\nis what we were doing.\n\n56\n00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,642\nBecause we did see some things going on in\nour network that we didn't want going on.\n\n57\n00:03:34,642 --> 00:03:36,732\nAnd so, after a while, we said, all right,\n\n58\n00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:39,540\nhere's what we're gonna\nactually put in place.\n\n59\n00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:46,480\nBut for that to happen, I had to go in and\nmanipulate the actual NAT rules, okay?\n\n60\n00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,230\nSo for network address translation,\nI had to go in and change them, to try and\n\n61\n00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,854\nactually do this unusual configuration\nthat we were trying to do.\n\n62\n00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,631\nIt went perfectly fine in terms of\nthe NAT rules that I had changed,\n\n63\n00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:01,350\nbut I didn't tell anybody\nI was changing them.\n\n64\n00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,240\nSo when that ended up happening here,\nand I knew that they had to be changed,\n\n65\n00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,480\nwell, I changed them and I just went\nahead and closed out everything.\n\n66\n00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,289\nAnd within ten minutes or so, okay, it\ndidn't take long, somebody said, hey, you\n\n67\n00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:19,961\nknow that we can't connect our phones or\nactually get out to the Internet anymore?\n\n68\n00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:23,212\nI was like, oh, yeah,\nI wonder what happened there.\n\n69\n00:04:23,212 --> 00:04:25,500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I didn't even think about it.\n\n70\n00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,100\nAnd then, it was two minutes\nlater I'm like, wait a minute,\n\n71\n00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,110\nI'm the last one that\nactually made a change.\n\n72\n00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,140\nAnd that's when somebody says, oh,\nlet's see if that's what's going on.\n\n73\n00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,175\nWell, we go back in and we change\neverything back, everything works.\n\n74\n00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:40,675\nOnce again, that type of change,\nespecially that drastic\n\n75\n00:04:40,675 --> 00:04:43,745\nduring the middle of business day,\nprobably should have never happened.\n\n76\n00:04:43,745 --> 00:04:47,065\nIn other words, Ronnie Wong overstepped\nhis boundaries there at that point and\n\n77\n00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:49,835\nmade changes,\nbecause I knew what we were going to do.\n\n78\n00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:52,995\nI probably just shouldn't\nhave done it that way, okay?\n\n79\n00:04:52,995 --> 00:04:59,060\nIn small organizations, it's easy enough a\nlot of times to just let people know that.\n\n80\n00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,750\nHere's what I'm about to do, okay?\n\n81\n00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:06,080\nWell, I knew that this was assigned to\nme as a task, actually the week before.\n\n82\n00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,060\nAnd I didn't think anything about it when\nI came in and I started making changes,\n\n83\n00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,300\nand I just kind of walked away from\nit here and didn't realize it.\n\n84\n00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,740\nBut the very fact is, I should have\nof actually let somebody know,\n\n85\n00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,850\nI'm about to make those\nparticular changes here.\n\n86\n00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,122\nOkay, so a lot of times it's\neasy enough for, like I said,\n\n87\n00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,490\nin smaller organizations\nshoot out an email.\n\n88\n00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,290\nOr again, notify someone else.\n\n89\n00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,410\nAnd so Nate says, well,\nwait a minute Ronnie.\n\n90\n00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,500\nDo you know if this is gonna bring us\ndown or not, or whatever it might be?\n\n91\n00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,490\nWell at that point, I might of thought,\nwell, no, it shouldn't.\n\n92\n00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,630\nWe're just changing an IP address or\nso, and adding in a new one.\n\n93\n00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,770\nShouldn't change anything at all.\n\n94\n00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,990\nWell, I was completely wrong.\n\n95\n00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,950\nOkay?\n\n96\n00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,330\nSo, in a small organization,\nusually just a simple meeting or\n\n97\n00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,410\na simple email is enough.\n\n98\n00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,380\nBut in a large business,\n\n99\n00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:55,300\nin an enterprise level here,\nchange tends to be more formalized.\n\n100\n00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,950\nSo, a lot of times the changes\nthat we tend make,\n\n101\n00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,800\nthey really do have to go\nthrough a process here.\n\n102\n00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,150\nIn other words, there is a policy for\n\n103\n00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:07,900\nhow this stuff is normally handled when\nwe actually decided to make changes.\n\n104\n00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,340\nA lot of times, the decision to make\na change doesn't mean that the change is\n\n105\n00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,660\nimplemented automatically,\nor right then and there.\n\n106\n00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,780\nSmall organization, if you're the only\none doing it, you possibly can.\n\n107\n00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,370\nBut in a big organization, a larger\norganization, it may be that the change\n\n108\n00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,450\nthat you implement may break something\nelse like what I did, to the point where,\n\n109\n00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,660\nagain, it can actually be devastating.\n\n110\n00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,550\nSo a lot of times, those particular types\nof changes are actually written down in\n\n111\n00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:38,160\na formalized process here, and you submit\nthose changes to maybe a committee,\n\n112\n00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,530\nor someone that says they can\nauthorize that change for you.\n\n113\n00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,000\nWithout that authorization,\nyou can't do it.\n\n114\n00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,082\nSo you've gotta make sure\nthat you understand that,\n\n115\n00:06:46,082 --> 00:06:49,330\nwhen we start talking about\nthese different contexts here,\n\n116\n00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,180\nis that changes are just not done just\nbecause you wanna make them happen.\n\n117\n00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,030\nThey normally are done in this process and\nnormally for a good reason.\n\n118\n00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,080\nRight, Nate?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n119\n00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,130\nYeah, that's right.\n\n120\n00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,350\nAnd more times than not,\n\n121\n00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:04,480\nthere'll be some technical controls that\ncan be put into place to prevent changes.\n\n122\n00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,190\n>> They don't want somebody to\ninadvertently make any changes to\n\n123\n00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,345\nsomething whether it's a network change,\n\n124\n00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:14,810\nwhere people won't have\nthe permissions to make any changes.\n\n125\n00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,030\nAnd then after a change has been approved,\nor reviewed and\n\n126\n00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,760\napproved, and then an individual\nwill be moved into a user group or\n\n127\n00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,650\nsomething that does have\npermissions to make changes.\n\n128\n00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,970\nAnd then afterwards the person is removed.\n\n129\n00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:27,680\n>> Yeah.\n\n130\n00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,560\nA lot of times, some of the details behind\nthis idea of doing the change management,\n\n131\n00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,280\nagain, kind of goes unnoticed.\n\n132\n00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,400\nBecause we don't realize that what can\nhappen is we implement a change, and\n\n133\n00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,610\nwhen we implement a change here, nobody\nelse may know, first of all, what we did.\n\n134\n00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,040\nBut secondly, they may not know\nhow to remove that change.\n\n135\n00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,839\nSo in the more formalized process,\nyou submit the change that you wanna make.\n\n136\n00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:54,313\nYou actually submit kind of a detailed\noutline of what you wanna do.\n\n137\n00:07:54,313 --> 00:07:56,965\nAnd then you also, along with that submit,\n\n138\n00:07:56,965 --> 00:07:59,480\nhow do we back out of\nthat process as well.\n\n139\n00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,153\nAll that, again, gets submitted,\ngets reviewed here.\n\n140\n00:08:04,153 --> 00:08:05,453\nSomebody can say, yeah.\n\n141\n00:08:05,453 --> 00:08:07,070\nSomebody can say, no.\n\n142\n00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,420\nIt gets stamped.\n\n143\n00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,480\nIt gets approved or\nit gets denied at some point.\n\n144\n00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,701\nSometimes [INAUDIBLE] actually\njust something as simple as,\n\n145\n00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:17,680\nRonnie, not during business hours,\nso denied.\n\n146\n00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,070\nIt could be something like that, okay.\n\n147\n00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,580\nBut, sometimes it's easy enough\nto where you just sit there and\n\n148\n00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,280\ngo look, as I look through right,\n\n149\n00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,930\nif you're working on a big team there\nmay be multiple changes going on.\n\n150\n00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,630\nAnd we don't want those changes occurring\nsimultaneously with another change.\n\n151\n00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,570\nYou have two of them going on at\nthe same time on the same day,\n\n152\n00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,130\ncould be that you don't know\nwhich one conflicted, and\n\n153\n00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,380\nnow you're not sure what's\nactually causing the problem.\n\n154\n00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,960\nIs it your change, or\nis it the other guy's change here?\n\n155\n00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,010\nSo it could have been rejected just\nbecause another change was going on that\n\n156\n00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,190\nday, but\nyour change may actually be scheduled for\n\n157\n00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,160\nsomething a little bit\nfurther on down the line.\n\n158\n00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:51,760\nOkay?\n\n159\n00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,070\nSo, a lot of times these review processes\nare actually done for a very good reason\n\n160\n00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,890\nbecause those particular types of changes,\neven though they may need to be done,\n\n161\n00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,220\nthey may absolutely cause some\nissues that we don't want.\n\n162\n00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,900\nSo, we wanna make sure that we\ndo them in the proper context.\n\n163\n00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,620\nAnd change management is the way\nthat this is normally done.\n\n164\n00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,480\nA formalized process is always better,\nbecause it tracks.\n\n165\n00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,730\nNow if Nate were to implement a change on\na Friday, we have a rule, I say a rule,\n\n166\n00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,190\nwe have a standing rule here a lot\nof times from our senior tech here.\n\n167\n00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,640\nDon, he says,\nnever make a change on Friday.\n\n168\n00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,860\nWell of course the last change I made\nwas actually on a Friday evening.\n\n169\n00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,280\nGot home and I had a bunch of problems\nthat I had to kind of try and\n\n170\n00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,800\nremote in and fix in, but at the same\ntime why do something like this?\n\n171\n00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,180\nBecause now their encroaching\nin on our weekend.\n\n172\n00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,730\nSo a lot of times we don't want\nto make changes on Friday so\n\n173\n00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,905\nwe have to kind of find out what's\ngoing on during the weekend.\n\n174\n00:09:47,905 --> 00:09:51,127\nBut when you have stuff like that, right.\n\n175\n00:09:51,127 --> 00:09:55,489\nWhat if I actually went out of town,\nwhat if I decided I'm getting on\n\n176\n00:09:55,489 --> 00:09:59,102\nan airplane with Mike and\nWes and going out to Vegas too.\n\n177\n00:09:59,102 --> 00:10:02,211\nAnd now, I made the change,\nI leave Nate here to try and fix it,\n\n178\n00:10:02,211 --> 00:10:06,382\nand Nate's like, first of all, I don't\nknow what change Ronnie made, secondly,\n\n179\n00:10:06,382 --> 00:10:10,480\neven if I did know it, I don't know\nwhat I'd do to back out of that change.\n\n180\n00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,460\nSo a lot of times,\nhaving those step by steps really do help,\n\n181\n00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,880\njust in case I am not available,\nsomebody can follow the step by steps on\n\n182\n00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,790\nhow to back out of what change I made,\nvery important context for us to remember.\n\n183\n00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:27,130\n>> Now, let's say a change is made,\nand then something happens\n\n184\n00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,560\nthat bring the network down, or\nsome kind of problem, right?\n\n185\n00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,205\nIt brings us into our next little\npoint about incident management.\n\n186\n00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:35,975\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right, so\n\n187\n00:10:35,975 --> 00:10:38,070\nlet's say something has happened.\n\n188\n00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,370\nWell, now what do we do?\n\n189\n00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,500\nThe idea with incident management is\nmore or less just planning ahead.\n\n190\n00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,730\nThese are potential problems,\nthis is what can happen.\n\n191\n00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,340\nAnd when it does happen, what do we do?\n\n192\n00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,620\nWho do we notify?\n\n193\n00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,620\nWho heads up the project to fix it?\n\n194\n00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,270\nWhat are the steps to be done?\n\n195\n00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,810\nAnd when do we decide when\nthe incident has been resolved?\n\n196\n00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,570\n>> Right.\n\n197\n00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:05,660\nYeah, a lot of times remember that we've,\nI say we,\n\n198\n00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,110\nI've mentioned this before\nin other episodes here.\n\n199\n00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,800\nSo if you've watched any other episodes\nbefore, you've probably heard me say this.\n\n200\n00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,200\nThe very fact is security is more about\nthe idea of a strategic response to\n\n201\n00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,120\nsituations and to instances that happen\n\n202\n00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,480\nrather than the idea of some reactionary\ntype of response that we have.\n\n203\n00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,550\nAnd the reason why that's important is\nwhen some [INAUDIBLE] that's a security\n\n204\n00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,930\nincident, especially if you feel like\nyou're the one responsible for keeping\n\n205\n00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,570\neverything secure, well you kind of get\na little bit more hyped up about it,\n\n206\n00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,770\nyour adrenaline kind of rushes a little\nbit, your minds starts to rush through\n\n207\n00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,570\nall the different things that\nyou thought you had in place and\n\n208\n00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,020\nneeded to fix that didn't get done here.\n\n209\n00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:53,190\nThat it's very easy to react\nwrongly to idea of this.\n\n210\n00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,440\nAn instant response, in other words, a\nformalized type response and the way that\n\n211\n00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,110\nwe should do this, should already be in\nplace so that I don't have to over react.\n\n212\n00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,070\nI go, okay, that happened, but\nwhat is our next step to do?\n\n213\n00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,405\nSometimes I can't think very clearly,\nokay?\n\n214\n00:12:08,405 --> 00:12:12,040\nSo, if I have a cup of coffee like\nJason had a cup of coffee here with\n\n215\n00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,630\nnine shots of espresso in it,\nI probably couldn't think straight anyway.\n\n216\n00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,360\nBut that is why we have that\ninstant response ready to go.\n\n217\n00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,690\nIs that Jason can go, whoa, whoa, whoa,\n\n218\n00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,240\nwait a minute Ronnie, all we have to\ndo is follow the incident response.\n\n219\n00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,351\nNot what's going on in your rapidly\nspeeding mind because of how much caffeine\n\n220\n00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:32,106\nis coursing through your\nbody at this point as well.\n\n221\n00:12:32,106 --> 00:12:32,827\nOkay.\n\n222\n00:12:32,827 --> 00:12:36,650\nYup, Jason is doing a thumbs down\nright now saying are you joking?\n\n223\n00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,060\nYou need that caffeine to keep going.\n\n224\n00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,400\n>> Are you sure it was the thumbs down?\n\n225\n00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,670\n>> Well it looked like, I'm gonna\nassume it was a thumbs down, yeah,\n\n226\n00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,220\nthat definitely was not a thumbs down\n>> Yeah, there's a double thumbs down\n\n227\n00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:47,805\n>> Yeah, it was.\n\n228\n00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:49,980\n[LAUGH].\n\n229\n00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,340\nBut in terms of instant response, right.\n\n230\n00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,290\nWe want to make sure that when we have\nsomething like this there's really\n\n231\n00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,875\ntwo goals behind our\ninstant responses here.\n\n232\n00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:01,170\nOkay, that we want to\nmake sure that point out.\n\n233\n00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,133\nOkay, the first and\nforemost goal, and I can't spell,\n\n234\n00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:06,920\nI looked at my notes here just briefly.\n\n235\n00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,230\nIs to contain the instant appropriately.\n\n236\n00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,910\nOkay?\n\n237\n00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,490\nSo when something happens, right, the goal\nis not to allow that incident to continue\n\n238\n00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:20,130\nto spread and spread and spread, but\nis to try and contain it appropriately.\n\n239\n00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:24,560\nSo regardless of the incredible\njudo skills that Nate has,\n\n240\n00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,210\nokay, if somebody comes through\nour locked studio doors,\n\n241\n00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,050\nthe first thing on Nate's mind\nshould not be an incredible arm bar.\n\n242\n00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,606\nAnd make the guy cry out like a girl.\n\n243\n00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:34,568\n>> All right.\n\n244\n00:13:34,568 --> 00:13:37,680\n>> Don't get me wrong,\nhe could probably do it, but\n\n245\n00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,630\nit shouldn't be the first\nresponse that we have, right?\n\n246\n00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,090\nSo what we have here is to\ncontain it appropriately, right?\n\n247\n00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,410\nSo, at this point, and\n\n248\n00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,965\nyou shouldn't violate his civil rights\neither when you're doing it, so, yeah.\n\n249\n00:13:49,965 --> 00:13:52,910\nBut it's the appropriate response\nthat we're looking for, so\n\n250\n00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,670\ncontainment is the key.\n\n251\n00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:01,070\nThe second idea behind the actual instant\nresponse, of course, is to minimize\n\n252\n00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:06,100\nthe impact from whatever\nthe incident actually was here.\n\n253\n00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,710\nRemember that for\n\n254\n00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:11,190\nus, impact is how devastating that\nthis thing could actually be for us.\n\n255\n00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,560\nIf there is a security\nincident that happens,\n\n256\n00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,510\nis it something completely damaging?\n\n257\n00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,150\nOr is it something that we\ncan again minimize here?\n\n258\n00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,560\nAnd that's what we want to do in\nterms of our instant response there.\n\n259\n00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,890\nSo a controlled, a thought out,\nin other words, a strategic response.\n\n260\n00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,390\nIs clearly what we want to have.\n\n261\n00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,500\nWe take a look at the idea of some\ntype of violation that may go on.\n\n262\n00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,130\nOkay?\n\n263\n00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,640\nNow the other thing that we also have,\nI said two goals,\n\n264\n00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,860\nI should have said three here,\nis the idea of what we call remediation.\n\n265\n00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,730\nOkay, now when we take a look at that,\nright, the idea of remediation for\n\n266\n00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,640\nus is,\nhow do we come out of this incident.\n\n267\n00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,870\nHow do we begin to bring\neverything back up.\n\n268\n00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:55,797\nOkay, and we've looked at this before\nin the context of using something\n\n269\n00:14:55,797 --> 00:14:58,720\nlike what we call network access control.\n\n270\n00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,773\nOkay, where what we can do is take\na computer that may have been off of our\n\n271\n00:15:02,773 --> 00:15:06,963\nnetwork may actually be foreign to our\nnetwork, we plug that device in and\n\n272\n00:15:06,963 --> 00:15:11,492\nif there's a virus on it that, that\nparticular computer can then be segregated\n\n273\n00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:13,317\noff into its own segment here and\n\n274\n00:15:13,317 --> 00:15:17,640\nbe set to connect to what we call\nremediation servers that may be out there.\n\n275\n00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,300\nIn other words,\nto fix what issues that are actually\n\n276\n00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,250\nthe security violations that we have,\nand then they can be put back on.\n\n277\n00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,140\nBut the same thing has to happen in\nterms of instant response as well.\n\n278\n00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,920\nNot only do we need to make sure\nthat we can contain the incident and\n\n279\n00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,440\nwe minimize the impact.\n\n280\n00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,120\nBut we need a way to actually say,\n\n281\n00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,280\nhere's where our process is gonna begin\nin terms of recovery or remediation here.\n\n282\n00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,170\n>> Yup, and so\nwe do have a policy in IRP, right?\n\n283\n00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:44,840\n>> Yep.\n>> An\n\n284\n00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,180\nIncident Response\n>> Policy.\n\n285\n00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,000\nRight, then, in the course,\n\n286\n00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,730\nin the steps to find we'll be\nlaying out inside of hierarchy.\n\n287\n00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,079\n>> Yeah, a lot of times with these, right.\n\n288\n00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:57,731\nThese types of incident response policies\nthat natives are referring to, okay.\n\n289\n00:15:57,731 --> 00:15:59,966\nThese should not be held in secret.\n\n290\n00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:02,933\nIt's strange, you know.\n\n291\n00:16:02,933 --> 00:16:06,721\nAs much as we value the idea of\ncommunications, we may create\n\n292\n00:16:06,721 --> 00:16:12,470\nan incredible instant response policy and\nthen we just forget to distribute it.\n\n293\n00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,950\nSo, let's say,\nwe do have an instant response policy but\n\n294\n00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,140\nI didn't actually let Nate know about it.\n\n295\n00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:21,960\nWell, Nate's overreaction seemed perfectly\nfine to him when he actually did put that\n\n296\n00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,920\nkid into a judo throw that\ncame through the door.\n\n297\n00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,800\nBut because he didn't know about it,\nit kind of protects Nate but\n\n298\n00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,490\nit really should have been in place and\nhe should have known about it.\n\n299\n00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:37,050\nSo, having these response policies,\nessentially available\n\n300\n00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,450\nto people that need it, or even right\nout in the open, is no harm at all.\n\n301\n00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:45,890\nIt just makes sure that everybody knows\nwhat needs to be done when this happens.\n\n302\n00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:49,250\nIf not, we tend to, again, respond\nthe way that we think that we should.\n\n303\n00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,830\nSometimes, it's an over reaction,\nsometimes it's not enough reaction and\n\n304\n00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,702\nthat's why these particular types of\nincident response policies are key for us.\n\n305\n00:16:56,702 --> 00:16:58,418\n>> All right.\n\n306\n00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:01,490\nSo, let's switch gears a little bit.\n\n307\n00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,190\nSo, now, we've got our\nincident response policies and\n\n308\n00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,950\nthose sorts of things all kinda laid out.\n\n309\n00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,410\nWhat about our users?\n\n310\n00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,530\nOur users that are in our department, and\n\n311\n00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,380\nour users have certain rights and\npermissions.\n\n312\n00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,430\nRights to be able to perform some\nkind of action on our network,\n\n313\n00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,170\nwhether it's shutting down servers or\nsomething of that sort.\n\n314\n00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:27,670\nSo, when we have user and now,\nwhen we assign permissions to users,\n\n315\n00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:33,100\nwe don't really assign them right to\nthat user, we assign them to groups.\n\n316\n00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,470\nAnd then, we take these users and\nwe put them inside groups.\n\n317\n00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:41,640\nThen, when that user gets a promotion or\nsomething or moves departments,\n\n318\n00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,970\nwe just kind of take that user and\nwe just move them into a different group.\n\n319\n00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,990\nNow, they should be removed\nfrom the old group.\n\n320\n00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,134\nSo, if they're moving up\nthe chain of ladder or\n\n321\n00:17:51,134 --> 00:17:52,708\nif they're being demoted-\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n322\n00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,455\n>> They should be taken out\nof that management group.\n\n323\n00:17:54,455 --> 00:17:57,100\nOr if they're going from\nsales to marketing,\n\n324\n00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,630\nthey need to be removed from the sales and\nput into marketing.\n\n325\n00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:06,137\nNow, there is a little thing called\na privilege creep, where you have a user,\n\n326\n00:18:06,137 --> 00:18:11,228\nhe's been around for a while, and\nthis user goes from departments, and\n\n327\n00:18:11,228 --> 00:18:16,987\nall sorts of things, and this user isn't\nremoved from any of these other groups,\n\n328\n00:18:16,987 --> 00:18:19,939\nand so he retains all these permissions.\n\n329\n00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:27,570\nSo, this brings up on the other point\nabout user rights and permission reviews.\n\n330\n00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:32,550\nSo, we do need to do audits of\nour users to make sure that we\n\n331\n00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,350\nare following that principle\nof least privilege,\n\n332\n00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,850\nand to make sure that we don't fall\ninto that trap of privilege creep.\n\n333\n00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,310\nAnd make sure our users don't have\nmore permissions than they need to.\n\n334\n00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,880\n>> Yeah, one of the hardest things to do\n\n335\n00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,210\nis that idea of the principle\nof least privilege.\n\n336\n00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,540\nIt's always easier to think,\n\n337\n00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,210\nwell, if I give them more permissions\nthan they need, they'll be fine.\n\n338\n00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,300\nThey'll be able to do\nwhat they need to do.\n\n339\n00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,850\nOnce again, under a security audit,\n\n340\n00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,360\nwe won't actually use that\nprinciple at least for.\n\n341\n00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,500\nOnly assign what they need.\n\n342\n00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,220\nNo less but no more than they need here\nand for us to stay on top of that and\n\n343\n00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,530\nmake sure that it's actually happening.\n\n344\n00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,340\nEvery once in a while, when you get\nsomebody that actually says, well,\n\n345\n00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,340\nwhat is this all about and\n\n346\n00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,350\nyou got, wait a minute, they're not\nsupposed to have access to that.\n\n347\n00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,080\nWell, that probably should trigger\nsomething in you that I should take\n\n348\n00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,740\na look at the idea of why that user's\n\n349\n00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,410\nable to get access to things\nthat they're not supposed to.\n\n350\n00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,640\nBecause of what Nate\nactually described here,\n\n351\n00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,360\nthe very fact that we tend to actually\nassign the idea of the permission to\n\n352\n00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,430\nthe groups instead of an individual user,\na lot of times we may find out that\n\n353\n00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:38,650\nnot only did that person get access to it,\nbut maybe that whole entire group that we\n\n354\n00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:43,210\nactually created because of something I\naccidentally checked or didn't check yet.\n\n355\n00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,150\nAnd then, so, oh yeah,\n\n356\n00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:48,120\nyou should be able to gain access to this,\nit's something that we have to have.\n\n357\n00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,190\nSo, the idea of auditing is\nan important part of what we do.\n\n358\n00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:58,010\nAgain, it's not the glamorous\nside of IT security.\n\n359\n00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,555\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Auditing for\n\n360\n00:19:59,555 --> 00:20:02,865\nus is the analysis side of things here.\n\n361\n00:20:02,865 --> 00:20:04,935\nMaking an assessment on whether or\n\n362\n00:20:04,935 --> 00:20:08,835\nnot this thing is absolutely\nwhat we need or not.\n\n363\n00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:12,605\nA lot of times, it's easy to take\na look at things that you need to do.\n\n364\n00:20:12,605 --> 00:20:17,500\nFor audit and logs here,\nI'm gonna put that off into tomorrow.\n\n365\n00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,840\nBut when you start having these\nparticular types of instances here,\n\n366\n00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,820\nespecially with the privilege creep,\nis something that can get out of hand\n\n367\n00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,135\nto the point where now you're\nhaving to review everybody.\n\n368\n00:20:29,135 --> 00:20:31,525\nSo, keeping on top of it is\npretty much the key here but\n\n369\n00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:36,035\nauditing is a big part of what we\ncan do that really can help us.\n\n370\n00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:38,225\nWe should be doing auditing regularly.\n\n371\n00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:42,405\nA lot of times, there should be what\nwe call an audit policy as well.\n\n372\n00:20:42,405 --> 00:20:46,225\nWe may review the overall security\npolicy in our organization, let's say,\n\n373\n00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:47,855\nevery six months or so.\n\n374\n00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:52,690\nWe may actually implement the idea of\nan audit review on just certain systems\n\n375\n00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:57,520\neven more often here, and then, on\nemployees even more often if we need to,\n\n376\n00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,540\njust to ensure stuff\nlike this doesn't happen.\n\n377\n00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,662\nBut again, that comes comes through\nthe policy levels and what we tend to do.\n\n378\n00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:05,370\nAnd we'll start taking\na look at that as well.\n\n379\n00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,310\nAll right?\n\n380\n00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,746\n>> Yeah, Ronnie, and\n\n381\n00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:13,570\nthat does kind of tie into our next\npoint about performing routine audits.\n\n382\n00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,680\nAudits on all sorts of things.\n\n383\n00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,480\nAudits on our policies.\n\n384\n00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,630\nAudits on our user accounts.\n\n385\n00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:23,800\nNot only just the permissions that our\nusers have, but the accounts in general.\n\n386\n00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,840\nNow, let's say that we have\na contractor that comes in and\n\n387\n00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,600\nhe's gonna do some kind of work.\n\n388\n00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,090\nWell, he's gonna need an account to do\nwhatever kind of work that he needs.\n\n389\n00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,340\nWell, let's say, the contractor's done.\n\n390\n00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,690\nAnd his account remains active and\nso, this contractor would have\n\n391\n00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:46,620\nthe the opportunity then to come back,\nsit in the parking lot and jump onto\n\n392\n00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,930\nthat unsecured wireless access point that\nyou installed on a Friday afternoon.\n\n393\n00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,300\n>> Yes, that would have been me [LAUGH].\n\n394\n00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,547\n>> But there's always a control out there,\n\n395\n00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:59,690\nsome kind of control to\nkeep things in check.\n\n396\n00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,790\nWe could add this contractor's\naccount to automatically\n\n397\n00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,470\ndisable after a certain amount of time.\n\n398\n00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,410\n>> Right.\n>> If he just needs two weeks,\n\n399\n00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,970\nwell, set that timer.\n\n400\n00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,250\nHey, this account is only good for\ntwo weeks and then,\n\n401\n00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,590\nthe thing will automatically shut down.\n\n402\n00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,050\nAnd so, not only with those, but\n\n403\n00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:17,980\nwith auditing our equipment,\nkeeping tabs of equipment.\n\n404\n00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,830\nSo, back here in the studio, we've got all\nthese XOR cables and component cables and\n\n405\n00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,503\njust cables for all sorts of things.\n\n406\n00:22:23,503 --> 00:22:24,339\n>> Yeah we do.\n\n407\n00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:26,210\n[LAUGH]\n>> And so,\n\n408\n00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,150\nwe're gonna bring up another camera.\n\n409\n00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,020\nWe wanted to shoot something and it's\nlike, wait, where's this component cable?\n\n410\n00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,140\nWhere'd things go?\n\n411\n00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,890\nWell, kind of goes in with audits.\n\n412\n00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,170\nJust keep tabs on all\nof your stuff through.\n\n413\n00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,450\nJust make sure that things\nare where we think they are and\n\n414\n00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,230\nto kind of prevent theft or\njust misplacement.\n\n415\n00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:50,180\n>> Yeah, it's very important in terms\nof these audits to make sure that we\n\n416\n00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:55,240\nare following whatever the actual\npolicy says to follow.\n\n417\n00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,050\nOnce you get behind in this stuff,\nit becomes very difficult cuz\n\n418\n00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:02,750\nnow you're looking at a tremendous amount\nof data that you now have to go in and\n\n419\n00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,530\nactually assess and\nverify when something started happening.\n\n420\n00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,030\nAnd once we actually realized that time\nperiod, now you have to trace that all\n\n421\n00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:14,190\nthe way back and see that maybe on every\nother machine, that this person might have\n\n422\n00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:17,940\nactually been able to get access to or\nmight have actually effected as well.\n\n423\n00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,030\nSo, staying on top of it here\nis a crucial part of the idea of\n\n424\n00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:28,960\nmitigating some of the risks that we will\nface as we continue to move forward here.\n\n425\n00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,150\nSo, implementing regular auditing for us,\nwe've kind of hit that pretty good here.\n\n426\n00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:37,470\nWe've talked about the idea of change\nmanagement, especially in big systems and\n\n427\n00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,850\neven in small systems here.\n\n428\n00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,242\nRemember that you do not make\nchanges just because you want to.\n\n429\n00:23:41,242 --> 00:23:45,566\nYou wanna make sure that these things are\nreviewed and taken a look at, and you'll\n\n430\n00:23:45,566 --> 00:23:49,953\nsee that in a more formalized or larger\norganization where there's a structured IT\n\n431\n00:23:49,953 --> 00:23:54,043\nstaff, you're probably gonna see that\nmore often than in a small business.\n\n432\n00:23:54,043 --> 00:23:56,141\nIt doesn't mean it's not good practice for\n\n433\n00:23:56,141 --> 00:23:58,409\nyou to actually have\nchange management here But\n\n434\n00:23:58,409 --> 00:24:02,332\nit just means that you'll probably see it\nmore often in that big context instead.\n\n435\n00:24:02,332 --> 00:24:05,300\nThat will be reviewed, okay.\n\n436\n00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,430\nAnd the same thing for\nthe instant response policies as well.\n\n437\n00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:13,270\nKeeping all these policies directly\nin front of everyone, okay,\n\n438\n00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:18,190\nthat's gonna be involved is also a key\nin some of the features that we have.\n\n439\n00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,400\nSo just remember that.\n\n440\n00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,220\nAnd again auditing plays\ninto that as well.\n\n441\n00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,630\nCuz, it really does provide for\n\n442\n00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:28,240\nus the ability to know that we're being\nvigilant at what we're doing here and\n\n443\n00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,410\nthat we're actually keeping everything on\ntrack in the way that we need to as well.\n\n444\n00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:35,000\nOkay, so\ngood assessments also play into it too.\n\n445\n00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,245\n>> All right.\n>> So for\n\n446\n00:24:36,245 --> 00:24:38,405\nus that's a lot of the different\nthings that we have.\n\n447\n00:24:38,405 --> 00:24:42,455\nWe've still got a couple of more topics\nhere that we want to get through.\n\n448\n00:24:42,455 --> 00:24:44,850\nSo, Nate, you want to move on here?\n\n449\n00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,825\n>> Yeah,\nwe do have just a little bit of time left.\n\n450\n00:24:47,825 --> 00:24:50,990\nBut Ronnie I'm kind of a Windows guy.\n\n451\n00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,290\n>> Right?\n>> I like Windows, right?\n\n452\n00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,410\n>> Yes, you do.\n>> Over the other operating systems.\n\n453\n00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,430\nAnd talking about auditing, so\n\n454\n00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:02,740\nwithin Windows we can turn on auditing for\ncertain kinds of events.\n\n455\n00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,740\nNow on my computer,\nwhile you were talking on,\n\n456\n00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,440\nwe logged into a virtual machine\nhere that we have running.\n\n457\n00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,690\nYou take a look at some of our auditing.\n\n458\n00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,700\n>> Right.\n>> Things that we can turn off, or\n\n459\n00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,460\nsome of our access and stuff.\n\n460\n00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,380\nSo I've got the server manager here,\nput it up.\n\n461\n00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,310\nAnd in here, right, so\nwe've got our group policy management.\n\n462\n00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:30,109\nAnd in here, so we just go to\nthe policy called Audit Settings.\n\n463\n00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,120\nAnd we get this guy pulled up here.\n\n464\n00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,610\nAnd under computer configuration, and\nwindows settings, security settings,\n\n465\n00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:41,600\nlocal policies, and\nthen finally audit policy.\n\n466\n00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,270\nRight.\nWe've got these various items here\n\n467\n00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,720\nthat we can turn on, right?\n\n468\n00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,130\nSo audit our logon events, right?\n\n469\n00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:53,870\nWe can track those success logon attempts,\nor those denied logon attempts.\n\n470\n00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:59,130\nSo that we can, once we audit these logs,\nwe can find out somebody's trying to\n\n471\n00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:04,910\nbrute force somebody's user account,\nor that sort, or object access.\n\n472\n00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,460\nLet's say we've got a folder.\n\n473\n00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,960\nA folder on our network\nshare that's called,\n\n474\n00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,620\nI don't know some kind of money,\nmoney something.\n\n475\n00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,290\n>> Marketing.\n\n476\n00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,770\n>> Marketing stuff, right?\n\n477\n00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:20,310\nSo we can turn on Object Access to that to\nfind out who is trying to snoop around, or\n\n478\n00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,650\nwho's trying to get into this folder.\n\n479\n00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,470\nSo we have these various\nthings that we can turn on.\n\n480\n00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:30,110\nTo audit our events, onto our network and\non our file system shares.\n\n481\n00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,470\n>> Yeah, Windows actually does a very good\njob in terms of the auditing that it gives\n\n482\n00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,530\nus, but again, don't forget that\nother systems will do it too.\n\n483\n00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,400\nA lot of times once you actually\nstart turning it on here, right.\n\n484\n00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,120\nYou have to weed through a lot of\ninformation and that's the key, again,\n\n485\n00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,370\nis keeping on top of the auditing\nthat needs to be done.\n\n486\n00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:52,290\nIf you don't, it's just so much data\nthat you actually have to worry about.\n\n487\n00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:56,340\nSo there, for us,\nusing the audit policies here.\n\n488\n00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,170\nAnd the reason why we actually like\nimplementing things like what Nate\n\n489\n00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,755\nshowed us here, cuz it tracks everything.\n\n490\n00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:03,670\nRight.\nYour computer actually tracks so\n\n491\n00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:07,000\nmuch stuff, the idea of being\nhow to turn on the audit and\n\n492\n00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,020\nseeing the stuff that we need here.\n\n493\n00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,460\nGives us a nice time stamp,\n\n494\n00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:14,300\nmay even tell us who's actually\naccessing this computer as well.\n\n495\n00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,688\nSo it really does help us out to be able\nto track more then we realize, okay.\n\n496\n00:27:17,688 --> 00:27:21,870\n>> All right, Ronnie,\nwell after this you know so we next,\n\n497\n00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:25,650\nwe get into data loss prevention and\nthose sort of things.\n\n498\n00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:29,660\nBut we are running a little bit low on\ntime, so now might be a good point.\n\n499\n00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,490\n>> Great.\nSounds great.\n\n500\n00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,030\n>> Yeah.\n\n501\n00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,690\n>> So let's go ahead and\n\n502\n00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,330\ndo this because we're about to\nswitch gears just a little bit.\n\n503\n00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:37,770\nWe got a little bit more to finish\nin terms of these risk mitigation\n\n504\n00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,730\ntypes of context that we're talking about.\n\n505\n00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,000\nAnd what we do.\n\n506\n00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,420\nWe got just a couple points and\nthen we will continue to move on.\n\n507\n00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,200\nBut this is a great time for a break.\n\n508\n00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,635\nSo we'll see you in a few minutes and\nright after this break.\n\n509\n00:27:47,635 --> 00:27:50,447\n[SOUND]\n\n510\n00:27:50,447 --> 00:27:56,072\nAll right.\n\n511\n00:27:56,072 --> 00:27:59,207\nWelcome back as we continue to move\nforward through our progress here through\n\n512\n00:27:59,207 --> 00:28:03,070\nsome of the different securities context\nthat we actually have to be familiar with.\n\n513\n00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:07,870\nAnd the tools that we're gonna use to help\nus to control those contacts as well.\n\n514\n00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:12,470\nNow we had just finished talking about\nthe idea of using some audit policies and\n\n515\n00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:16,390\nalso the instant response policies,\nas well as change management.\n\n516\n00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,800\nAnd now where are we going Nate?\n\n517\n00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,010\nInto the realm of.\n\n518\n00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,234\n>> Enforcing policies and procedures.\n\n519\n00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:29,090\n>> Yeah, for us when we take a look\nat the idea of policy enforcement and\n\n520\n00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,140\nprocedures for us, right.\n\n521\n00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,770\nIt's not enough just to say that we have\npolicies on hand, we have to be able to\n\n522\n00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:41,190\nknow that the policies that we have on\nhand have to be implemented somehow, okay.\n\n523\n00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:45,000\nAnd so the way that we take policies and\nwe begin to implement them,\n\n524\n00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,870\nis to put into place what I\ncall the idea of practices and\n\n525\n00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,080\ndifferent procedures\nthat we actually have.\n\n526\n00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,650\nSo here are the notes that\nI've actually made for this.\n\n527\n00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,180\nAnd I don't know, in my mind I was\nkinda getting a little bit lost.\n\n528\n00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,600\nI was like,\nwell that doesn't look right, but\n\n529\n00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,090\nit's actually fine in what we're\ntaking a look at here, okay?\n\n530\n00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,560\nSo for our networks, right?\n\n531\n00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:07,180\nIt's not enough just to have the idea\nthat we need to mitigate the idea risk.\n\n532\n00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:11,570\nWe have to put in place some of\nthe different things, to make sure that\n\n533\n00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:15,820\nthe idea of data loss, or theft, or\nwhatever it is, is not gonna happen.\n\n534\n00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,330\nAnd so we take those policies, and we put\nsome practices and procedures behind them.\n\n535\n00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:25,520\nSo for example, we can actually implement\nthe idea of privacy policies here.\n\n536\n00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,020\nBy putting procedures into place\nthat let people know that,\n\n537\n00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,670\nhey, we are gonna be watching.\n\n538\n00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,380\nHere's what you have to do when\nyou come into the building.\n\n539\n00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,440\nHere's what you have to, you know,\nkinda realize what's gonna happen here.\n\n540\n00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,540\nSo, all of these are actually different\ntypes of privacy policy practices\n\n541\n00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,260\nthat we may have.\n\n542\n00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:47,080\nSo we implement procedures that\neverybody will actually have to follow.\n\n543\n00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,240\nThey may have to log in.\n\n544\n00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,540\nThey may have to actually sign their name.\n\n545\n00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,040\nThey may have to do some of\nthese other things here and\n\n546\n00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,990\njust kind of give them\nthe practice of understanding\n\n547\n00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:58,260\nthat they are actually going to\nbe following these policies.\n\n548\n00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,670\nEven though it's just a piece of paper,\nwe've got things to make them do it,\n\n549\n00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,430\nin other words, to enforce what we have.\n\n550\n00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,250\nOkay.\n\n551\n00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:08,080\nSame thing goes with the idea of\nacceptable use policies, as well, right.\n\n552\n00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,210\nSo and\n\n553\n00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,620\nsome of the different implementations\nthat we're talking about here, right.\n\n554\n00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,630\nEven though I can say Nate you\nare not to browse Netflix or\n\n555\n00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:20,970\ngo to Pinterest today, you know,\non your workplace computer.\n\n556\n00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,110\nWell again, that doesn't mean that\nNate can't say, I don't care,\n\n557\n00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:27,710\nI'm gonna go ahead and go on to Pinterest\nand get my free IKEA bumper sticker, or\n\n558\n00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,417\nwhatever the heck you get.\n\n559\n00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:31,530\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> I don't know what you do on Pinterest,\n\n560\n00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,210\nit shows you how much I know about it.\n\n561\n00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,100\nOkay.\n\n562\n00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,670\nBut to be able to put in place the things\nlike that web security gateway, okay.\n\n563\n00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:42,380\nOr to implement proxies so that I can\ntell when someone like Nate decides he's\n\n564\n00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:46,190\ngotta have his interior decorating fix for\ntoday here.\n\n565\n00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,949\nAnd make his whatever\nPinterest thing that he makes.\n\n566\n00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,720\nI love picking on you about that\nbecause you love Pinterest.\n\n567\n00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,270\n>> It's strange, because I don't\neven have a Pinterest account.\n\n568\n00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,014\nIf you even need an account\nto browse there.\n\n569\n00:30:59,014 --> 00:31:01,220\n>> Sure [LAUGHS].\n\n570\n00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:01,877\n>> Yeah.\n\n571\n00:31:01,877 --> 00:31:04,130\nToo late denying it now, Nate.\n\n572\n00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,750\n>> Do they even have like an Android app?\n\n573\n00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,535\nI mean, I have no idea.\n\n574\n00:31:06,535 --> 00:31:09,330\n>> [LAUGH] You got me.\n\n575\n00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:12,346\nI know that the people of\nPinterest are mostly women.\n\n576\n00:31:12,346 --> 00:31:14,680\n[LAUGH] I'm sorry.\n\n577\n00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,730\n>> No, that's fine.\n\n578\n00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:20,240\nBut yeah, you know, as far as\nthese policies and procedures and\n\n579\n00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,678\nthose sorts of things go into place and\n\n580\n00:31:23,678 --> 00:31:27,210\nwe have kinda, a hash through some\nof these on a previous little bit.\n\n581\n00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:31,820\nSo, but you know user training so that was\na very good point to throw in there that\n\n582\n00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:36,270\na lot of these users they may not\nknow they may not understand or\n\n583\n00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:40,010\nthey may just not even be aware and\nthey're violating some of this stuff.\n\n584\n00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:45,075\nSure, I mean there's policies,\nand Ronnie, when you had a,\n\n585\n00:31:45,075 --> 00:31:49,310\n[LAUGH] a little clowning in\nthe chat room this morning.\n\n586\n00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,820\n>> Yeah, I know.\n\n587\n00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,753\n>> But I just lost my thought of user.\n\n588\n00:31:52,753 --> 00:31:54,196\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so user training.\n\n589\n00:31:54,196 --> 00:31:57,177\nOur user training here is\na very important part,\n\n590\n00:31:57,177 --> 00:32:01,758\nas Mike picks on me about having Pinterest\nMike is the first one that I know as\n\n591\n00:32:01,758 --> 00:32:06,410\nsome guy to actually have a Pinterest\naccount, so that's all I know.\n\n592\n00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,323\nBut in terms of user training,\n\n593\n00:32:08,323 --> 00:32:11,936\nwe need to understand that users\nneed to be aware of these.\n\n594\n00:32:11,936 --> 00:32:14,374\nAgain, I can't just come out and\nsay, Nate, here's our policy.\n\n595\n00:32:14,374 --> 00:32:16,900\nAnd Nate goes, well, where was the policy?\n\n596\n00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,310\nWe have to make them aware of this.\n\n597\n00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:21,870\nWe have to have clear lines of\ncommunication so they know who to come and\n\n598\n00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:25,590\nask if we implement these policies and\nthey think it's actually strange and\n\n599\n00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,380\nwhat's actually being done.\n\n600\n00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,930\nAnd the same thing is we educate\nthem to why we're doing it.\n\n601\n00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,890\nWithout these things in place\nalong with the practices and\n\n602\n00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,500\nprocedures that we put in place to help,\nit seems like a constrained\n\n603\n00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,900\nworkplace where it's very difficult to\nask any questions, to actually have any\n\n604\n00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:45,480\nmore understanding about why we do some\nof the security practices that we do.\n\n605\n00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,490\nSo user training here, procedures and\npractices, all very good things, and\n\n606\n00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:53,300\nthen going back to what we actually\ntalked about a little bit earlier here.\n\n607\n00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:58,550\nRegular auditing verifies for us any\nparticular current security implementation\n\n608\n00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:03,425\nthat we put in place, whether they're\ngood security or it's bad security.\n\n609\n00:33:03,425 --> 00:33:11,280\nThey help us to assess the risks that\nwe may also end up facing as well.\n\n610\n00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,090\nSometimes we do not know if it's\na risk until we take a look\n\n611\n00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,970\nat the activity that's going on too.\n\n612\n00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,130\nAnd again,\ncircling all the way back around here,\n\n613\n00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,280\nthat principle of least privileged\nthat Nate was also talking about.\n\n614\n00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,190\nAll this comes into play when\nwe start having to enforce\n\n615\n00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:30,660\nsome of these different\nideas here in our business.\n\n616\n00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:35,290\nBecause without this, these are actually\npractices that we do in the context of our\n\n617\n00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:39,870\nbusiness at any point so\nthat we can actually monitor and\n\n618\n00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:44,460\nhelp to prevent the loss of what could\nbe very valuable to our business.\n\n619\n00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,870\nSo we want to make sure that we\nhave those things in place for us.\n\n620\n00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:53,218\nNow, they do talk about something\nvery interesting here, and\n\n621\n00:33:53,218 --> 00:33:57,989\nI think this is actually meant in\nthe context of the Security+ exam.\n\n622\n00:33:57,989 --> 00:34:02,747\nFor the objectives here, they give us\nreally only one big kind of example\n\n623\n00:34:02,747 --> 00:34:05,408\nthat they're really pointing at here.\n\n624\n00:34:05,408 --> 00:34:10,783\nWhich is the idea of what we call data\nloss prevention, this technical control.\n\n625\n00:34:10,783 --> 00:34:14,690\nAnd Nate, you were talking about that just\na little bit earlier during our break.\n\n626\n00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,170\n>> Data loss prevention?\n\n627\n00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:19,630\n>> Yeah, the idea of some of the technical\ncontrols that are in place for us for\n\n628\n00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,350\ndata loss?\n\n629\n00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:24,830\n>> Yeah, having policies is one thing,\nso when you were hired on you had\n\n630\n00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:28,240\na little new hire packet and\nthere's all those little forms and\n\n631\n00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,230\npapers that explain certain things you\nhave to sign when you're hired on.\n\n632\n00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,450\nDid you read through all of them?\n\n633\n00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:33,950\n>> No.\n\n634\n00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:34,590\n>> Every page, right.\n\n635\n00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:39,470\nSo policies are there and sure,\nnobody really reads all of them.\n\n636\n00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:43,790\nSo what we can do then, is we can\nuse our technical controls, right?\n\n637\n00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,850\nWe can really force it down.\n\n638\n00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:50,262\nAnd a lot of times we can force it\ndown through access control lists,\n\n639\n00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:55,260\nthrough least privileged by\nlimiting their permissions.\n\n640\n00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,010\nAnd there's other policies, right?\n\n641\n00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:01,776\nGroup policies for one example.\n\n642\n00:35:01,776 --> 00:35:07,965\nNow, just as one example here,\nI still am logged into that server here.\n\n643\n00:35:07,965 --> 00:35:13,890\nAnd all the group policy management,\nwe'll just use that same Audit Settings.\n\n644\n00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,700\nWe'll pull it up here.\n\n645\n00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:20,777\nAnd so Computer Configuration >\nPolicies > Administrative Templates and\n\n646\n00:35:20,777 --> 00:35:26,950\nthen into System > Device Installation\n> Device Installation Restrictions.\n\n647\n00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:30,110\nAll right, so let's,\nwhat about this guy right there?\n\n648\n00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,890\nPrevent installation of removal devices.\n\n649\n00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:37,925\nLet's say that we have a policy that you\ncannot bring in these USB flash drives,\n\n650\n00:35:37,925 --> 00:35:40,180\nthat we want to protect our data.\n\n651\n00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,376\nWe want to make sure that employees\nare not removing files and\n\n652\n00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:48,255\ndocuments, forms or\nwhat have you out of our business.\n\n653\n00:35:48,255 --> 00:35:51,169\nSo you cannot bring in these USB devices.\n\n654\n00:35:51,169 --> 00:35:55,260\nWell, some people still might, whether\nthey didn't receive that training or\n\n655\n00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,062\nwhat have you.\n\n656\n00:35:56,062 --> 00:35:58,397\nSo what we can do is enforce it.\n\n657\n00:35:58,397 --> 00:36:00,145\nAll right, we can use these\ntechnical controls to enforce it.\n\n658\n00:36:00,145 --> 00:36:02,060\nAnd here is one example.\n\n659\n00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:06,360\nWe can use this policy here,\nprevent installation of removal devices.\n\n660\n00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,134\nAny kind of flash drive, it will not work.\n\n661\n00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:12,976\nThey can put it in,\nWindows won't do anything about it.\n\n662\n00:36:12,976 --> 00:36:17,164\nAnd there's some others in here where we\ncan limit to it certain USB flash drives,\n\n663\n00:36:17,164 --> 00:36:20,580\nif we had a company issued flash drive,\nor something of that sort.\n\n664\n00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:25,493\nWe can make sure that the flash drives\nhave to be encrypted with BitLocker To Go\n\n665\n00:36:25,493 --> 00:36:28,660\nin order for these employees to use it.\n\n666\n00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:33,770\nNow, let's say, so\nflash drives are one thing, but on a DVD,\n\n667\n00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:38,470\nwe can fit 4.7 GB of data onto a DVD.\n\n668\n00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:42,029\nWell, we've got that covered\ntoo through technical controls.\n\n669\n00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,960\nSo go up to Removable Storage Access.\n\n670\n00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,280\nSo down here we said, hey,\nyou can bring in a CD or\n\n671\n00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,540\nDVD and you can read it,\nbut you cannot write to it.\n\n672\n00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,300\nSo we have these type of\ncontrols right here that,\n\n673\n00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,770\nyeah, you cannot write\nanything to those disks.\n\n674\n00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:05,480\nSo these are just one example there's\nare many, many different types of controls\n\n675\n00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,430\nthat we can implement to\nprevent this loss of our data.\n\n676\n00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,270\nOr, not loss, but just theft.\n\n677\n00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:16,541\n>> Yeah, a lot of times these generalized\ntypes of controls are what we do see when\n\n678\n00:37:16,541 --> 00:37:20,330\nwe start thinking about how do\nwe control access to the data.\n\n679\n00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:23,240\nSo access controls are pretty much\nthe key for us when we do it.\n\n680\n00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,030\nWhen we take a look at what\nis called out on the exam,\n\n681\n00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:29,830\nthey specifically mention\nsomething they call DLP,\n\n682\n00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:33,590\nData Loss Protection here, and I kinda\nhave it right there in my notes, DLP.\n\n683\n00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:38,190\nNow, the reason why they call that out\nis because they're really mentioning\n\n684\n00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:42,500\nsomething that's fairly technical here and\nI'll just do a single diagram for\n\n685\n00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,950\nus, not really anything hefty here.\n\n686\n00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:50,750\nBut data in our networks,\nin our devices here always exists,\n\n687\n00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,480\nessentially, in three different states.\n\n688\n00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,510\nThe very fact is, data is at rest.\n\n689\n00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:59,190\nSo when data is just stored on\nthe hard drive, it's archived,\n\n690\n00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,540\nit's there,\nit's not gonna change very much, we\n\n691\n00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:07,720\nhave to make sure that we can protect data\nin that particular point in time here.\n\n692\n00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,970\nWe also have data in transit,\nor in motion, right?\n\n693\n00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:13,820\nWe're moving data from\nthe storage device that we have.\n\n694\n00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,400\nWe have a shared storage\ndevice that we use here and\n\n695\n00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,320\nwe're transferring it over to my machine.\n\n696\n00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,580\nI may be accessing it wirelessly, I may\nbe accessing it from across the network.\n\n697\n00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,275\nHeck, I may be sitting at home and\n\n698\n00:38:24,275 --> 00:38:27,330\nactually remoting in to access\nto that device as well.\n\n699\n00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:30,080\nWe need to be able to protect the data,\n\n700\n00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:34,885\nnot only while it's actually stored,\nbut also in transit.\n\n701\n00:38:34,885 --> 00:38:40,390\nAnd lastly, we also have to worry about\nthe data while it's in use as well.\n\n702\n00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:45,385\nSo all three of those are the contexts\nthat we do, and using some of the things\n\n703\n00:38:45,385 --> 00:38:51,605\nthat Nate mentioned here really do help us\nto protect data in those formats as well.\n\n704\n00:38:51,605 --> 00:38:55,355\nNow, when we take a look at it here,\ndata loss protection is normally about\n\n705\n00:38:55,355 --> 00:38:59,740\nthe software that is generally\nbeing used to help us to do that.\n\n706\n00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:04,150\nAnd so in the notes here I actually\nbrought up three different links here.\n\n707\n00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,860\nAnd we'll talk about what we're\nprotecting against in a moment.\n\n708\n00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:12,820\nBut you actually see that many\ncompanies have different [LAUGH].\n\n709\n00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:16,650\nMy apparent ability to\ndouble-click is not there.\n\n710\n00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,670\nSo, notice that Symantec has one here.\n\n711\n00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:23,590\nSo, it talks about protecting your\nconfidential data from loss and theft.\n\n712\n00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:26,550\nAnd these things, again,\nare fairly expensive here.\n\n713\n00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:30,770\nBut they're actually designed to help\ndo all of that, while it's protected\n\n714\n00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:35,030\nin storage, while it's in transit,\nas well as while it's in use here.\n\n715\n00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:39,010\nSo you do have some different features\nthat are actually right there too.\n\n716\n00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,175\nNow, beyond the idea of just software,\n\n717\n00:39:41,175 --> 00:39:43,593\nhere was one I pulled up\na little bit earlier,\n\n718\n00:39:43,593 --> 00:39:48,008\nthis actually does it in the cloud, which\nis the RSA Data Loss Prevention as well.\n\n719\n00:39:48,008 --> 00:39:51,190\nWhere they have essentially\nan appliance that's\n\n720\n00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,697\nin the cloud that you rent as a service.\n\n721\n00:39:53,697 --> 00:39:56,825\nSo this is one of those cloud\nservices that we may also have.\n\n722\n00:39:56,825 --> 00:39:59,487\nThat you can go out there and\ntake a look at.\n\n723\n00:39:59,487 --> 00:40:01,810\nAnd, let me see the last link here.\n\n724\n00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,650\nThe one from EMC actually,\n\n725\n00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:09,000\nthat's the wrong, see I did it\nin the wrong order, I skipped.\n\n726\n00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,940\nThere we go.\nI was going to say, I skipped one.\n\n727\n00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,840\nHere's one from McAfee.\n\n728\n00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,980\nI just pulled up the three that kinda\ncame up, right there near the top.\n\n729\n00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:19,980\nAnd you'll see, again, a lot of it\nrevolves around this idea of the software\n\n730\n00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,930\nand what it can do for you and\nyour organization, okay?\n\n731\n00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,350\nThe reason why we need this is,\n\n732\n00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:28,230\nbecause a lot of times organizations\nhandle very sensitive information,\n\n733\n00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:31,840\npersonally identifiable information,\nfinancial information.\n\n734\n00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:36,000\nWe need to make sure,\nthat in all three states, that our data\n\n735\n00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,650\nis actually gonna be protected in\nthe way that it needs to be done, okay?\n\n736\n00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:43,190\nNow, normally when we talk\nabout the necessity for\n\n737\n00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:47,310\ndata protection, it's because\nof these two terms right here.\n\n738\n00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:47,950\nOkay?\n\n739\n00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:51,170\nThe idea of what we call data loss and\ndata leakage.\n\n740\n00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:54,610\nNate, do you know the difference\nbetween these two terms?\n\n741\n00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:57,620\n>> What data loss, it's just, it's gone?\n\n742\n00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,560\n>> It's gone.\n>> Gone forever.\n\n743\n00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,110\n>> Yeah.\n>> And data leakage,\n\n744\n00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:03,588\nit leaves you're company and\ngoes somewhere else.\n\n745\n00:41:03,588 --> 00:41:05,667\n>> [LAUGH] Yes, you're right.\n\n746\n00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:08,745\nYeah, the technical difference,\ndon't get me wrong,\n\n747\n00:41:08,745 --> 00:41:11,576\nthey essentially mean about\nthe same thing, okay?\n\n748\n00:41:11,576 --> 00:41:13,120\nBut technically the way it goes, right.\n\n749\n00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,331\nData loss is when Nate takes that data,\n\n750\n00:41:15,331 --> 00:41:19,352\nusing that USB thumb drive that he's\nnot supposed to be able to plug into\n\n751\n00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:23,860\nmy network here, and he takes the data and\nhe doesn't leave it behind, right?\n\n752\n00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,310\nSo, he literally takes it and he goes.\n\n753\n00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,770\nNow that data is lost.\n\n754\n00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:29,240\nI didn't mean to hit my microphone there.\n\n755\n00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,490\nNow that data is lost to me.\n\n756\n00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,790\nI don't have access to it anymore.\n\n757\n00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:36,770\n>> Data leakage though,\nis when Nate just takes it with him and\n\n758\n00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:39,600\nthen sells it to whoever, okay?\n\n759\n00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,947\nIKEA.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n760\n00:41:40,947 --> 00:41:43,410\n>> Then I still have my data, and\n\n761\n00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:45,040\nnow IKEA has a copy of my data.\n\n762\n00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,740\nIn other words,\nthe data has gotten out, but\n\n763\n00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,010\nI still have an existing copy of my data.\n\n764\n00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:53,300\nWe need to protect against both of those,\nand so implementing some type of\n\n765\n00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,975\nsoftware that can help us do this as one\nof those controls that we talked about.\n\n766\n00:41:57,975 --> 00:42:00,040\nThat'll really helped us to enforce this.\n\n767\n00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:04,360\nSo, using these types of technology\ncontrols that may mention policies,\n\n768\n00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,540\nas well as something\nlike this as an example.\n\n769\n00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,670\nPretty much some of the stuff that we\nhave to make sure that we do understand,\n\n770\n00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,935\nas we continue to move forward here\nin terms of our security context.\n\n771\n00:42:13,935 --> 00:42:15,557\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n772\n00:42:15,557 --> 00:42:16,207\n>> Yeah.\n\n773\n00:42:16,207 --> 00:42:18,950\n>> Well, Ronnie, that's pretty good.\n\n774\n00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:23,770\n>> Yeah.\nNow, that is our last little point on 2.3.\n\n775\n00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,810\nWe do have some time left.\n\n776\n00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,731\n>> Let's make sure that we kind\nof review just a moment, right,\n\n777\n00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:30,260\nbecause we went over a lot Nate.\n\n778\n00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:34,713\nWe've just kind of, for me it feels like\nwe've just been constantly talking and\n\n779\n00:42:34,713 --> 00:42:37,422\nwe have,\nwe've been constantly talking here.\n\n780\n00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:39,670\nSo let's make sure we hit\nthe major points again.\n\n781\n00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:42,194\n>> Okay.\n>> So, let's start off here, change\n\n782\n00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:47,662\nmanagement is how we began right, in terms\nof our context for risk mitigation, okay?\n\n783\n00:42:47,662 --> 00:42:50,400\nWe wanna make sure that everybody\nactually understands that.\n\n784\n00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,830\nThat there is always a purpose to it.\n\n785\n00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:54,360\nThat we do implement it.\n\n786\n00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,990\nWe put it in practice.\n\n787\n00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,915\nWe again,\ntalked about that idea in a small context,\n\n788\n00:42:58,915 --> 00:43:01,128\nas well as a big scenario as well, okay?\n\n789\n00:43:01,128 --> 00:43:03,998\nWe also talked about the idea\nof incident management here, or\n\n790\n00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,051\nincident response policies, too, okay?\n\n791\n00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:11,809\nRemember that the overall goal is\nalways about a strategic response.\n\n792\n00:43:11,809 --> 00:43:15,996\nAs much as it's easy to just sit there and\ngo, Nate, get them, as that guy comes\n\n793\n00:43:15,996 --> 00:43:20,388\nthrough the door, it's not always the most\nappropriate response here, as well.\n\n794\n00:43:20,388 --> 00:43:23,117\nAnd so, we wanna make sure it's\nalways that driven by the incident\n\n795\n00:43:23,117 --> 00:43:23,906\nresponse policy.\n\n796\n00:43:23,906 --> 00:43:28,270\nThe proper response, okay,\nthat's actually out there.\n\n797\n00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:32,630\nSometimes it's very easy to overreact,\nand so we don't want that.\n\n798\n00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:35,005\nRemember that all the time,\nwhen we start taking a look here,\n\n799\n00:43:35,005 --> 00:43:37,630\nincident response\npolicies are always what?\n\n800\n00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:41,400\nThey help us to contain\nthe incident appropriately.\n\n801\n00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,910\nMinimize the overall damage,\ngive us steps for remediation, as well.\n\n802\n00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:49,730\nNow for me, I haven't actually been\ninvolved in anything that's been so\n\n803\n00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:52,010\ndisastrous that I can tell you about.\n\n804\n00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:56,320\nBut, a lot of times, what you actually see\nis maybe your company doesn't have this.\n\n805\n00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,420\nWell, what do you do then?\n\n806\n00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,450\nWell, you start to do what?\n\n807\n00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,086\nYou start to actually train.\n\n808\n00:44:00,086 --> 00:44:04,070\nIn other words,\nyou put yourself into mock situations,\n\n809\n00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:06,700\nwhere you may go ahead and\njust say, all right, we're gonna\n\n810\n00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:11,140\npractice this in case something like this\ndoes happen, and see what goes on, okay?\n\n811\n00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,240\nSo, you may not come up with\nevery single scenario, but\n\n812\n00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,885\nyou may actually got ahead and\nbe able to see that, okay?\n\n813\n00:44:16,885 --> 00:44:17,755\nIn this last section here,\n\n814\n00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:21,445\nwe talked about the idea of the way\nthat we enforce these policies here.\n\n815\n00:44:21,445 --> 00:44:24,985\nWe put into what we call the,\nwe take the policies and we create what?\n\n816\n00:44:24,985 --> 00:44:29,125\nPractices and procedures to help us\nto implement these policies here.\n\n817\n00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:32,215\nWe also make sure that\nusers are actually trained.\n\n818\n00:44:32,215 --> 00:44:32,975\nOkay?\n\n819\n00:44:32,975 --> 00:44:35,335\nAnd that they know what\npolicies are in place,\n\n820\n00:44:35,335 --> 00:44:37,545\nand how they're supposed to actually work.\n\n821\n00:44:37,545 --> 00:44:40,710\nWe continue to actually audit\nthe things that we need to do.\n\n822\n00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:41,270\nWe review.\n\n823\n00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:45,900\nAnd then lastly here, we talked about\nthe idea of data loss prevention\n\n824\n00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,550\nin the context of some of the group\npolicies that we can implement,\n\n825\n00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:52,605\nas well as some of the software that we\ncan put in place to help us out as well.\n\n826\n00:44:52,605 --> 00:44:53,660\nOkay?\n\n827\n00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:58,270\nSo, that's kind of a good review as\nwe continue to move forward here.\n\n828\n00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:00,370\nSomething that you do have to consider.\n\n829\n00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:03,540\nIn everything that you do, you've gotta\nremember that there are certain things\n\n830\n00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:07,420\nthat will apply in a situation and\nthings that are not gonna apply here.\n\n831\n00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,900\nAnd so, we've just given you some of the\ndifferent contexts that you can actually\n\n832\n00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,920\nsee the use of this in.\n\n833\n00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,900\nYep?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n834\n00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,200\n>> All right.\n\n835\n00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,840\n>> I like it.\n\n836\n00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,854\nAll right, so now move on to 2.4?\n\n837\n00:45:18,854 --> 00:45:20,060\n>> That's right [LAUGH].\n\n838\n00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:27,006\n>> All right then, so 2.4,\nit's all about basic forensics stuff.\n\n839\n00:45:27,006 --> 00:45:32,684\nAnd I believe I have, oh yeah, so I still\nhave our official objectives up here.\n\n840\n00:45:32,684 --> 00:45:38,460\nSo, we'll get into 2.4, given a scenario,\nimplement basic forensic procedures.\n\n841\n00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:42,420\nAll right, so something's happened and\nsome kind of incident.\n\n842\n00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,760\nAnd so now, we move into that point\nof gathering up our evidence,\n\n843\n00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,830\nmaking sure that it stays protected,\nthat it stays untampered with, so\n\n844\n00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:57,080\nthat we can take it from the scene\nall the way to court, if need be.\n\n845\n00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,238\nTo be able to present it as evidence.\n\n846\n00:45:59,238 --> 00:45:59,806\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n847\n00:45:59,806 --> 00:46:04,996\n>> And so, the steps going from there\nto over there, are all lined out here.\n\n848\n00:46:04,996 --> 00:46:07,734\n>> Yeah,\nnow when we first start off here, and\n\n849\n00:46:07,734 --> 00:46:10,696\nwe take a look at this idea of forensics,\nokay?\n\n850\n00:46:10,696 --> 00:46:16,733\nWe've gotta kinda put ourselves into\nthis unusual question situation here.\n\n851\n00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:20,410\nWhat we have to ask,\nwhy can't I just ignore this, Nate?\n\n852\n00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:24,400\nWhy can't I just go,\nI'm not a law enforcement officer,\n\n853\n00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,980\nI don't have any real special training.\n\n854\n00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:30,440\nEven as a security professional,\nI don't really have any special training\n\n855\n00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,280\nin terms of what is needed\nin a court of law here.\n\n856\n00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:38,350\nCan I safely ignore this,\nin the context of you being an IT security\n\n857\n00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:43,520\nprofessional in the middle of\nthe second decade of the 21st century?\n\n858\n00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,170\nAnd the answer is, nope, you can't do it.\n\n859\n00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:50,160\nNate, it's impossible,\nyou cannot do it, okay?\n\n860\n00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,760\nThe reason why is that, more and\n\n861\n00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,860\nmore, every company,\nregardless of the company that you're in,\n\n862\n00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:59,930\nyou must follow the very fact that\nyou are living in a nation of laws.\n\n863\n00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:01,740\nNo matter where you are in the world.\n\n864\n00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,640\nYou are living with other people in\na civilized country that you have, okay?\n\n865\n00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,460\nWhen you ignore this idea and\nsomething does happen in your company,\n\n866\n00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:15,070\nsuch as what Nate mentioned here,\nfirst and foremost, and you can follow my\n\n867\n00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:20,120\nnotes if you want to here, you can destroy\nthe evidence without even realizing.\n\n868\n00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:24,670\nIf your company absolutely says,\nlook, that absolutely happened and\n\n869\n00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:30,520\nwe need to prosecute this, by ignoring\njust the basic forensic procedures.\n\n870\n00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:35,260\nWe're not talking about the most detailed,\nI'm not talking about CSI and\n\n871\n00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,800\nthe guy from Vegas comes out and\nstarts examining everything.\n\n872\n00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,160\nOr the guy with the glasses from Miami.\n\n873\n00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,900\nI can't remember what his name is.\n\n874\n00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,740\nI'm sure somebody knows it.\n\n875\n00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:44,240\nBut you kinda get the idea.\n\n876\n00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,521\nBut, what I'm saying is,\nthe basic processes here,\n\n877\n00:47:46,521 --> 00:47:49,360\nthat if people were to come in and\ngather and really do this, right?\n\n878\n00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,408\nWe could be destroying the evidence\nthat's in hand, right?\n\n879\n00:47:52,408 --> 00:47:56,382\nThe other thing that can end up happening\nof course Is that evidence that we think,\n\n880\n00:47:56,382 --> 00:47:58,117\nyeah, here's all the stuff here!\n\n881\n00:47:58,117 --> 00:47:59,579\n\"What did you follow?\n\n882\n00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:01,650\nI just ripped it all up.\n\n883\n00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:03,260\nNope.\nIt could be ruled inadmissible,\n\n884\n00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:06,310\nin other words,\nnot acceptable in the court of law here.\n\n885\n00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:07,210\nHate to say it.\n\n886\n00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:12,340\nThis is where you,\nin terms of your situation at a company,\n\n887\n00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:15,870\nworking as an IT professional\nin security here.\n\n888\n00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:20,740\nYou could be under some type\nof regulatory violation and\n\n889\n00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,790\nnot even realize that it's happening.\n\n890\n00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:23,570\nOkay?\n\n891\n00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:27,630\nSo in that sense here you\ncould be violating the law.\n\n892\n00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:30,080\nAnd you go well,\nI didn't know about, okay?\n\n893\n00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,430\nNate, has that ever?\n\n894\n00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:33,050\nIt might have helped you,\nit's never helped me.\n\n895\n00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:34,400\nWhenever some cop has stop me and\n\n896\n00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,210\nI said I didn't know what\nthe speed limit was around here.\n\n897\n00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:38,260\nFirst thing he told me, he was like,\n\n898\n00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,245\ndo you have speed limit\nsigns in your community?\n\n899\n00:48:40,245 --> 00:48:41,860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n900\n00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:44,290\nYou know what the speed limit is there?\n\n901\n00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:44,930\nYeah.\n\n902\n00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:45,660\nSame speed limit here.\n\n903\n00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,470\nI was like, oh.\n\n904\n00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:49,780\nSo, have you ever held by saying that?\n\n905\n00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:52,320\n>> Hm.\n>> I don't know the law about this?\n\n906\n00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:56,420\n>> No, I've never been pulled over before.\n\n907\n00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,050\n>> Oh, Nate.\n\n908\n00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:00,013\n>> I've never been in that kind\nof situation to have to do that.\n\n909\n00:49:00,013 --> 00:49:02,440\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, okay well, never mind.\n\n910\n00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,050\nYeah, I don't know, he's snickering over\nhere about it for some reason or another.\n\n911\n00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:07,330\nOkay.\n\n912\n00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:09,470\nThere's also the idea of liability.\n\n913\n00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:09,995\nOkay?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n914\n00:49:09,995 --> 00:49:11,740\n>> That ends up happening as well.\n\n915\n00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:15,240\nWe cannot safely ignore,\nyou know, easily ignore,\n\n916\n00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:19,200\nthe idea that we need to understand\nbasic forensic procedures.\n\n917\n00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,390\nProcedure here, okay?\n\n918\n00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:25,390\nWe're not going to teach you every\nlittle aspect of forensic procedure when\n\n919\n00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:31,340\nthe security guy, he'll talk about\nthe forensic procedures more in depth and\n\n920\n00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:34,152\nin detail more than I can ever do.\n\n921\n00:49:34,152 --> 00:49:38,316\nBut the fact is that there is some\nliability you may have if you go oops,\n\n922\n00:49:38,316 --> 00:49:41,585\nI didn't know i am suppose\nto delete all those emails.\n\n923\n00:49:41,585 --> 00:49:45,915\nUS Government.\n\n924\n00:49:45,915 --> 00:49:50,130\nWhat do you say to that?\n\n925\n00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:52,820\nIgnorance is not the best\nclaim that you have it.\n\n926\n00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,415\nSo, no we can not ignore this.\n\n927\n00:49:55,415 --> 00:49:59,160\nRegardless of the examples that\nare set by our experts now.\n\n928\n00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,426\n>> [LAUGH] Name is Nate.\n\n929\n00:50:01,426 --> 00:50:02,095\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No.\n\n930\n00:50:02,095 --> 00:50:06,905\nBut you kind of get the idea okay.\n\n931\n00:50:06,905 --> 00:50:09,520\nSo it can be safely ignored here.\n\n932\n00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:14,850\nAre there absolutely benefits to\njust knowing the basic ones here?\n\n933\n00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:15,390\nOkay.\n\n934\n00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:19,490\nJust like we talked about here, the nice\nthing is, you, if you start to pay\n\n935\n00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:23,010\nattention to this, you will figure out\nthe way the some of the processes work,\n\n936\n00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:24,870\nespecially on the technical stuff, right,\n\n937\n00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:29,250\nyou'll probably get a better understanding\nof the hacking process itself.\n\n938\n00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,270\nOkay.\n\n939\n00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:32,820\nYou will start to actually\nuse those security tools and\n\n940\n00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:36,150\nthis is something that I'll gladly admit,\nokay?\n\n941\n00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:40,490\nI like the idea of securing systems,\nI hate looking at every little detail of\n\n942\n00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:43,200\nevery single program because there's so\nmany of them out there.\n\n943\n00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:43,830\nOkay?\n\n944\n00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:48,350\nBut yes, you should actually have a good\ngrasp of at least some of the different\n\n945\n00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:52,630\nsecurity tools that are actually out there\nthat are available to the companies.\n\n946\n00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:54,780\nAnd again you should know\nhow to use them as well.\n\n947\n00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,470\nOkay?\n\n948\n00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:58,680\nAnd lastly of course, you'll be able\nto preserve that evidence, right.\n\n949\n00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,500\nYou'll collect the evidence in\na way that will be legally.\n\n950\n00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:05,160\nAdmissible in the actual court of law,\nokay?\n\n951\n00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,880\nSo there are major benefits that\nwe do have that are right there.\n\n952\n00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,850\nNow, specifically if you're\nright here in the United States.\n\n953\n00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:16,490\nSo those of you that are actually watching\nfrom overseas, that are looking at this\n\n954\n00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,770\nrecording, this doesn't necessarily apply\nto you, I put these down because this\n\n955\n00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:23,580\nis actually what applies to us\nhere that we're in the states.\n\n956\n00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,900\nWe're not going to go over these.\n\n957\n00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,220\nBut remember that your\norganization though,\n\n958\n00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:31,350\nmay have to show that it follows\nsome regulatory compliances.\n\n959\n00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:35,450\nSo in your country you to substitute in\nwhat you may actually have to worry about\n\n960\n00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:37,770\nin your situation.\n\n961\n00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:40,570\nFor us, we have to worry about\nthese things: the fourth and\n\n962\n00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,080\nfifth amendment and the constitution.\n\n963\n00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:44,900\nWe have to worry about these\nparticular statutes here.\n\n964\n00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:48,800\nNow again, I put those in place\njust as notes, as examples.\n\n965\n00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,310\nDon't worry about learning those for\nthe exam.\n\n966\n00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:56,490\nAs you go on for other more detailed\nsecurity related certifications,\n\n967\n00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,730\nyou may actually have to learn\nsome of these, but at this point,\n\n968\n00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:00,710\nthese are just examples for us.\n\n969\n00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:03,350\nAnd then there's the idea\nof realizing that\n\n970\n00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:06,960\nevidence has to go on if you're going\nto be doing this process, okay?\n\n971\n00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,430\nSo there's a lot here, okay?\n\n972\n00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:13,380\nBut remember, this stuff here\nis just really about examples.\n\n973\n00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,650\nSo in your country, again, you'll have\ndifferent ones that you have to follow.\n\n974\n00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:22,900\nYour company will pretty much say, hey, If\nyou're gonna be here, here are the things\n\n975\n00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:26,600\nthat we have to make sure that we do\nadhere by and that we do follow, okay?\n\n976\n00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,250\nSo, don't put it off as something\nthat you don't have to worry about.\n\n977\n00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,000\nThere's a huge benefit for you and\n\n978\n00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,150\nyour company,\neven if it never goes all the way.\n\n979\n00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,720\nTo the idea of ever\nbringing it in court here.\n\n980\n00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,370\nWe actually make sure\nthat we're complying.\n\n981\n00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:41,940\nWe make sure that we actually\nunderstand what we're doing here.\n\n982\n00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,700\nAnd that makes your company a better\ncompany in terms of security\n\n983\n00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,310\neach and every day.\n\n984\n00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,970\nOkay?\n>> Yup.\n\n985\n00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:51,210\nAlright Nate,\nyou let me talk too long again and so\n\n986\n00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:54,040\nthat means it is now time for our break.\n\n987\n00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,240\nNow we haven't even gotten to\nthe basic forensic procedures yet.\n\n988\n00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,650\nWhich we're gonna make Nate actually do,\nsince I talked so\n\n989\n00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:02,090\nmuch in this last segment here.\n\n990\n00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:03,880\nWe're gonna talk about\nit as we go through.\n\n991\n00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:08,370\nBut when we get back, we're gonna take\na look at those basic forensic procedures\n\n992\n00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:12,140\nas well, and make sure that we cover them,\nyou know, enough of that.\n\n993\n00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,920\nWe're gonna talk about them a little\nbit further on down the line\n\n994\n00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,360\nin other episodes, So at this point\nit's really kind of a teaser but\n\n995\n00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,410\na good understanding in the context\nthat we're talking about.\n\n996\n00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,950\nAnd so, stay tuned for\nthat in our next segment.\n\n997\n00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,144\nWe'll see you right after our break.\n\n998\n00:53:25,144 --> 00:53:31,946\n[MUSIC]\n\n999\n00:53:31,946 --> 00:53:34,667\nAll right, welcome back as we\ncontinue on through here and\n\n1000\n00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:37,410\ntake a look at our security\ncontexts that we have.\n\n1001\n00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:40,540\nWe're now taking a look\nnow at the actual basic.\n\n1002\n00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:45,550\nForensic procedure responses that we can\nactually have when something does happen\n\n1003\n00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:50,610\nfor us that we may need to present the\nevidence into the idea of at some point.\n\n1004\n00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,370\nSo, we wanna take a look at that.\n\n1005\n00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:56,540\nNow, we actually have a list of different\nthings that we are going to be.\n\n1006\n00:53:56,540 --> 00:54:01,620\nTalking about here and so we're gonna take\na look at some of the different ones here.\n\n1007\n00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:05,216\nWe'll start off with the idea\nof the order of volatility.\n\n1008\n00:54:05,216 --> 00:54:07,759\nOkay Nate,\nwhat are we gonna take a look at here?\n\n1009\n00:54:07,759 --> 00:54:10,103\n>> [NOISE] So the order of volatility.\n\n1010\n00:54:10,103 --> 00:54:12,760\nSo, we have a PC.\n\n1011\n00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,670\nAnd now this PC has some data,\n\n1012\n00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:18,410\nsome information,\non it that we need to collect.\n\n1013\n00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:23,150\nSo, there is a certain order that\nwe are to collect that data.\n\n1014\n00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:24,870\nUp at the very front.\n\n1015\n00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:25,780\nAll right.\n\n1016\n00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,280\nStuff running in RAM.\n\n1017\n00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,440\nStuff running in cache.\n\n1018\n00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,700\nWe need to grab this stuff.\n\n1019\n00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,790\nIf the PC powers down\nthen that is RAM is lost.\n\n1020\n00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:39,060\nEverything sitting in some\nkind of cache is now lost.\n\n1021\n00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:45,040\nSo those items there are up at the very\ntop, that's what we need to collect first.\n\n1022\n00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:49,030\nAfter that we things like network logs.\n\n1023\n00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:53,190\nWe've got any kind of virtual\nmemory that maybe running.\n\n1024\n00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:55,190\nWe got to grab that stuff as well.\n\n1025\n00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:59,290\nIf anything happens to this PC\nthen that information is lost.\n\n1026\n00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:04,660\nAll right beneath that\nwe have our hard drives.\n\n1027\n00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:07,040\nInformation on hard drives.\n\n1028\n00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,100\nAny kind of USB flash drives.\n\n1029\n00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:13,350\nSo those are there,\nwe can take that stuff.\n\n1030\n00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:17,978\nAnd then last,\nwe have information such as CD-ROMS,\n\n1031\n00:55:17,978 --> 00:55:21,320\nDVD-ROMS, printouts, right?\n\n1032\n00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,830\nSo those are the.\n\n1033\n00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:27,080\nOrder to go that we need to collect our\ndata to make sure that we get everything.\n\n1034\n00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,160\n>> Yeah.\n\n1035\n00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,680\nThe reason why we have to worry about\nthe order of volatility again is because\n\n1036\n00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:36,490\ndata can simply go missing very quickly,\nokay?\n\n1037\n00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:39,840\nAnd that is because of the way, and\nwhere the data actually exists, right?\n\n1038\n00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,810\nFor us, in RAM,\nit needs electricity to stay on.\n\n1039\n00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:47,031\nIf some well intentioned soul sister and\nsays, hey i want to protect the data cause\n\n1040\n00:55:47,031 --> 00:55:49,966\nI know this needs to be presented\nin court, and they go and\n\n1041\n00:55:49,966 --> 00:55:53,902\nthey yank the power out, thinking that\nthat way they'll save everything.\n\n1042\n00:55:53,902 --> 00:55:56,217\nWell, they've saved just about everything.\n\n1043\n00:55:56,217 --> 00:56:00,017\nBut they didn't save the stuff that was\nactually running in RAM at that point.\n\n1044\n00:56:00,017 --> 00:56:04,599\nSo when we start collecting the evidence,\nwe always have to make sure we get\n\n1045\n00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:09,880\nthe evidence that's more likely to\ndissipate first, or to disappear first.\n\n1046\n00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,930\nAnd then we can actually worry a little\nbit later on about getting the evidence\n\n1047\n00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:14,270\nthat actually can be around.\n\n1048\n00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:18,330\nSo things that are actually again on\nmedia, that's really not gonna change too\n\n1049\n00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:22,990\nmuch, like DVDs and CDs and\nof course the printouts that we have.\n\n1050\n00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:27,180\nThose we kinda toss into a box and\nexamine them at our leisure.\n\n1051\n00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:31,990\nWhereas something that's running on that\nmachine, if the machine is still up and\n\n1052\n00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:35,490\ndoing everything, well again,\nonce we remove the power, that's it.\n\n1053\n00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:39,570\nSo we have to actually be able to gather\nthat information as much as we can\n\n1054\n00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:40,620\nin this order, okay?\n\n1055\n00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:43,970\nAnd we have to be able to show\nthat we can do so as well.\n\n1056\n00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:46,660\nAnd that is pretty much a key for us,\n\n1057\n00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:50,710\nis making sure that we get all\nthe information that will help us to\n\n1058\n00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:53,815\nagain establish all of\nthe evidence that we need, okay?\n\n1059\n00:56:53,815 --> 00:56:55,110\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1060\n00:56:55,110 --> 00:57:00,500\n>> All right, so once we have those few\nitems, so now we can take an image,\n\n1061\n00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,620\na system image of the hard drives.\n\n1062\n00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,410\nNow these images here,\nthis is going to be a bit for\n\n1063\n00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:10,640\nbit back up,\nan exact duplicate of this hard drive.\n\n1064\n00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,620\nNow, there's various third party\ntools out there that can do that.\n\n1065\n00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:19,630\nAnd so, the reasons why we would need\na bit for bit backup of the hard drive is,\n\n1066\n00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:26,715\none, for archival purposes, so we have\nan untouched copy of this hard drive.\n\n1067\n00:57:26,715 --> 00:57:30,285\nAnd the other reason is that we\nhave something to work with,\n\n1068\n00:57:30,285 --> 00:57:32,625\nis we don't want to manipulate any data.\n\n1069\n00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:37,045\nWe don't want to do anything to this\nhard drive, whether on accident or\n\n1070\n00:57:37,045 --> 00:57:41,759\nanything of that sort, with system logs\nand those sorts of things, I mean,\n\n1071\n00:57:41,759 --> 00:57:43,912\nthings will be recorded on there.\n\n1072\n00:57:43,912 --> 00:57:48,810\nAnd so if we make an exact duplicate of\nthis hard drive then we have something\n\n1073\n00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:52,151\nthat we can pull apart,\ndig into, copy files off or\n\n1074\n00:57:52,151 --> 00:57:55,767\nwhat have you without messing\nwith the original disk.\n\n1075\n00:57:55,767 --> 00:57:59,020\n>> Yeah, and that's very important\nbecause remember that the original\n\n1076\n00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:03,090\nhard drive that we're gonna have\nis now considered evidence for us.\n\n1077\n00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:06,140\nAnd the more often that we manipulate\nthe evidence and we access it,\n\n1078\n00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:10,550\nthe more chances that that can corrupt or\nwe can do something wrong with it.\n\n1079\n00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:14,100\nAnd now we have destroyed data\nthat should be in existence.\n\n1080\n00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:19,040\nSo the idea of actually keeping the hard\ndrive untouched as possible here,\n\n1081\n00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,520\ngives us this ability once we get\nthe idea of the system image.\n\n1082\n00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:26,720\nNow the system image usually for us,\nwhen we do it the best that we do,\n\n1083\n00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,410\nis normally we turn the machine off and\nwe reboot and we create this system image.\n\n1084\n00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:35,110\nBut there are products out there that will\nallow you to image a computer while it's\n\n1085\n00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:39,900\nactually running so that you can actually\nget all the information right there and\n\n1086\n00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:44,510\nbe able to actually have an image copied\nwhile it's actually live to do so.\n\n1087\n00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:48,010\nBy keeping both these, by keeping the\noriginal hard drive and keeping one for\n\n1088\n00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:49,600\narchival purposes,\n\n1089\n00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:54,560\nit means that if I happen to be working\non the working image, right, and\n\n1090\n00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:59,460\nI mess something up, I have to go back to\nthe original hardware to pull that data.\n\n1091\n00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:04,020\nI can go back to the archival image and\nactually get information off of that.\n\n1092\n00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:09,160\nAgain not touching the original data again\nis pretty much the key when we do this.\n\n1093\n00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,060\nNow we're going to see this\nactually used a little bit later on\n\n1094\n00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,020\nas well when we start\ntalking about hashing 2.\n\n1095\n00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:18,137\nBut for us here, we want to make sure\nthat we understand that this is a very\n\n1096\n00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,690\nimportant part here okay,\n\n1097\n00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:23,670\nof keeping that chain of custy\nwhich we'll talk about as well.\n\n1098\n00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:26,640\nThe very fact is we have to be able\nto show that we're response for\n\n1099\n00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,140\nthe data all the way through\nthe process of collection\n\n1100\n00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:32,785\nof what we actually have in\nterms of information, okay?\n\n1101\n00:59:32,785 --> 00:59:33,810\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n1102\n00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:35,750\n>> Yup, so\nnow the next thing that we have,\n\n1103\n00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:39,110\nour line up here,\nnetwork traffic and logs.\n\n1104\n00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:43,240\nSo these traffic and logs,\nwhen a attacker gets into a system,\n\n1105\n00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:46,290\nthey almost always leave behind something.\n\n1106\n00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:50,890\nChances are that there will\nbe something left behind, and\n\n1107\n00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:53,720\nit's just a matter of finding it,\nof looking for\n\n1108\n00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:58,590\nit out there to be able to read between\nthe lines and pull the stuff out.\n\n1109\n00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:03,951\nNow this is with a network traffic in logs\nthis is for our idea this is our IDS's\n\n1110\n01:00:03,951 --> 01:00:09,810\nour IPS's our switches routers those sorts\nof items on our network we dig through and\n\n1111\n01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:14,791\npull those logs out of there and\nstart, kind of, connecting the dots.\n\n1112\n01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:18,123\n>> A lot of times, remember that every\ndevice that you pass through will\n\n1113\n01:00:18,123 --> 01:00:20,640\nessentially log something, okay?\n\n1114\n01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,540\nEvery computer that you go\ninto will log something about\n\n1115\n01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:25,310\nyour particular visit there.\n\n1116\n01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:28,730\nSoftware can actually be told that,\nhey it's been accessed.\n\n1117\n01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:31,850\nAnd even files can actually show\nthat something has been changed\n\n1118\n01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:33,300\non them as well.\n\n1119\n01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:37,980\nBeing able to take a look, especially at\nthe network level, right, you can trace\n\n1120\n01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:41,850\nusing the timestamps or whatever else\nit may be, at what particular point in\n\n1121\n01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:46,140\ntime did somebody did traverse the network\nand get access through those devices.\n\n1122\n01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,670\nAnd then if they can link it\nto a particular identity,\n\n1123\n01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:51,855\nthey now can actually follow\nthe trail on how he actually got in.\n\n1124\n01:00:51,855 --> 01:00:55,635\nSo very important, sometimes there is so\nmuch information that's gathered here,\n\n1125\n01:00:55,635 --> 01:01:00,115\nokay, that they can put it together and\npossibly identify\n\n1126\n01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:04,672\nwho it is that actually did get to this\npoint as was able to actually do this.\n\n1127\n01:01:04,672 --> 01:01:07,322\nSo, taking a look at this, okay?\n\n1128\n01:01:07,322 --> 01:01:12,092\nAnd the idea of logs is not again\nthe most exciting part of what we have.\n\n1129\n01:01:12,092 --> 01:01:16,382\nBut it is an important part of\nestablishing some of the ways we actually\n\n1130\n01:01:16,382 --> 01:01:19,512\nhave to understand in\nthe evidence collection as well,\n\n1131\n01:01:19,512 --> 01:01:22,632\nis making sure that we\nunderstand the idea of means,\n\n1132\n01:01:22,632 --> 01:01:26,455\nmotive, and opportunity, okay, and\nthis is what we can also show here, too.\n\n1133\n01:01:26,455 --> 01:01:27,680\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1134\n01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:33,380\nYeah, now although with this the primary\nfocus is on separate appliances or\n\n1135\n01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:34,860\non the network.\n\n1136\n01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:39,640\nOn a Windows machine,\nwe can also configure logging in that,\n\n1137\n01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,780\nand by default it's turned off.\n\n1138\n01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:44,860\nWe can do that,\nif you want to take a look at real quick.\n\n1139\n01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:45,670\n>> Sure, let's do it.\n\n1140\n01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:46,460\n>> All right, so\n\n1141\n01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:50,490\nI've got this Windows server machine\nstill that I am logged in to.\n\n1142\n01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:54,780\nAnd so what we'll do,\nwe go down to Tools, and\n\n1143\n01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:58,100\nthen Windows Firewall\nwith advanced security.\n\n1144\n01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,920\nAnd this comes on right down here.\n\n1145\n01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,809\nWindows Firewall Properties.\n\n1146\n01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,810\nWe'll bring this up right here.\n\n1147\n01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:07,350\nWe've got log in now.\n\n1148\n01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:07,855\n>> No.\n\n1149\n01:02:07,855 --> 01:02:11,814\n>> With domain or private or\npublic whatever it is on.\n\n1150\n01:02:11,814 --> 01:02:18,350\nAnd so for a login we click on customize\nand right here so login drop packets.\n\n1151\n01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:19,740\nLogin successful.\n\n1152\n01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:20,770\nConnections.\n\n1153\n01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:22,500\nAnd so we can turn this stuff on here.\n\n1154\n01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,480\nAnd then where are these logs saved to?\n\n1155\n01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,820\nWell we have it saved onto\nthis particular machine\n\n1156\n01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:29,985\n>> So system 32 log files Firewall\n\n1157\n01:02:29,985 --> 01:02:34,870\npFirewall.log, or we can store these\nlog files on a separate server.\n\n1158\n01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:37,560\nThat if anything were to happen\nto this particular machine,\n\n1159\n01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:41,180\nwe're trying to wipe out, let's say if\nan attacker gets in, and is like okay,\n\n1160\n01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:46,810\nwell now I need to erase all the log\nfiles to try to cover up my steps.\n\n1161\n01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:52,580\nWe could have these log files go to some\nother PC so that we can protect those.\n\n1162\n01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:56,062\nSo from right here we can configure\nlogging on a Windows firewall.\n\n1163\n01:02:56,062 --> 01:02:57,580\n>> Um-hm, yeah.\n\n1164\n01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:00,181\nSo remember that for\nus logging is important.\n\n1165\n01:03:00,181 --> 01:03:03,265\nThis is actually where it gets into\na little more in terms of some of\n\n1166\n01:03:03,265 --> 01:03:06,030\nthe security configurations\nthat you may make.\n\n1167\n01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:07,770\nNot only things like windows machines, but\n\n1168\n01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:12,470\neven on firewalls,\nrouter and switches here.\n\n1169\n01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:17,510\nThis is way it;s important to have these\ntime stamps be synchronized all together\n\n1170\n01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:21,640\nso we show accurate times as things are\ngetting in here cuz that way we are not\n\n1171\n01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:25,450\nreviewing bad information or\nold information that we do.\n\n1172\n01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:29,630\nAnd so, if we have these things all\nsynchronized up, this logging and\n\n1173\n01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:32,450\nbeing able to track it makes it so\nmuch easier to know that we're\n\n1174\n01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:35,590\nlooking at the right event,\nis what we're taking a look at.\n\n1175\n01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:37,220\n>> Um-hm.\n>> All right, the next one here,\n\n1176\n01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:39,450\nNate, video or capture video.\n\n1177\n01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:44,520\n>> Yeah, capture video, so\ncapture video it is just that, to take,\n\n1178\n01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:48,540\nyou take video to analyze video\nto piece it all together.\n\n1179\n01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:51,498\nNow if we're dealing with things\nlike security cameras, so\n\n1180\n01:03:51,498 --> 01:03:55,616\nwe've got security cameras around, and\nit's gonna be a bunch of different feeds,\n\n1181\n01:03:55,616 --> 01:03:57,371\nstreams from the various cameras.\n\n1182\n01:03:57,371 --> 01:04:02,058\nSo to take that video, to be able to\nanalyze it, to line things up between all\n\n1183\n01:04:02,058 --> 01:04:06,899\nthe different cameras And to just make\na complete picture of the events that's\n\n1184\n01:04:06,899 --> 01:04:11,770\nhappened around, there's some kind of\nphysical break in to a security room.\n\n1185\n01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:13,530\nWe have a camera down the hallway.\n\n1186\n01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:16,890\nThen we've got a camera just\ninside the server room.\n\n1187\n01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:21,790\nTo be able to tie those two together and\nto get data to form a bigger picture.\n\n1188\n01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:22,490\n>> Yeah.\n\n1189\n01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:26,460\nIn the video capture department, you will\nactually see this more and more used.\n\n1190\n01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,760\nBecause it really can show the context and\n\n1191\n01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:32,440\nespecially the timing\nof when things happen.\n\n1192\n01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:36,260\nAnd so once they can actually show the\namount of time that someone's spent and\n\n1193\n01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:38,070\nthe time that it actually occurred.\n\n1194\n01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:43,410\nAnd again this goes into making sure that\nwe have all the evidence that we need.\n\n1195\n01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:46,470\nOh, i couldn't even have been there\nat that particular point in time.\n\n1196\n01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:49,680\nYou have the ability to scour\nthrough that and find clues and\n\n1197\n01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:53,130\nfind other things that you are looking for\nthat help build the case.\n\n1198\n01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:56,360\nSometimes even stuff that you go,\nthere's nothing on it.\n\n1199\n01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:58,150\nIt can actually reveal other things here,\nso\n\n1200\n01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:01,950\ntake the time to take a look at the video\nthat you actually are capturing\n\n1201\n01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:05,090\nthat's out there as well\nto help us out okay.\n\n1202\n01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:10,330\n>> Now you know one thing Ronnie that you\ndid kind of touch up on and that is our\n\n1203\n01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:16,530\ntime stamps or our time offsets now\nthat so it lets say we have a PC and you\n\n1204\n01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:20,950\nknow there's been some kind of a break in\non this PC did a you know what was taken.\n\n1205\n01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:25,550\nWell the PC is in one time zone and so\nnow you know we've got other files that is\n\n1206\n01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:30,080\non a server and\nthe server is on a separate time zone.\n\n1207\n01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,730\nSo it's not paying attention\nto those sorts of things.\n\n1208\n01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:35,050\nNow nothing really lines up.\n\n1209\n01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:39,420\nAnd you can't quite retrace these\nsteps to find out how the attack\n\n1210\n01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:43,150\nall came together or\nhow long the attack has been going on.\n\n1211\n01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:45,500\nSo then getting the time together.\n\n1212\n01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:49,489\nNow there are some systems\nthat will have their time as\n\n1213\n01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:52,420\nsince the system has been on.\n\n1214\n01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:55,590\nI have a pfSense firewall at the house.\n\n1215\n01:05:55,590 --> 01:06:00,580\nAnd on some of the logs on there,\nit's timed since it's been running.\n\n1216\n01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:05,020\nIt can be days, weeks, or what have you.\n\n1217\n01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:09,920\nOther times PCs will be\nrunning on a central time.\n\n1218\n01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:13,650\nSo to be able to offset those items there,\nyeah.\n\n1219\n01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:14,750\nTo have things like that.\n\n1220\n01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:15,670\n>> Yeah.\nYou know,\n\n1221\n01:06:15,670 --> 01:06:20,000\nthese time offsets are very important for\nus because of the very fact that we have\n\n1222\n01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,580\nto make sure that when\nthe incident took place,\n\n1223\n01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:29,010\nthat we can actually go ahead and\nsay we know when it actually happened,\n\n1224\n01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:32,620\nregardless of where that computer\nends up at some point in time.\n\n1225\n01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:37,470\nSo even if you actually were using or\nsomebody had used a laptop in the eastern\n\n1226\n01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:42,140\ntime zone to do some type of computer\nhacking they weren't supposed to do.\n\n1227\n01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:45,000\nThey fly over to the west coast and\ngo oh look my computers here,\n\n1228\n01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,680\nit's not over there and\nit's showing local time.\n\n1229\n01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:50,140\nEvery time when you go back in.\n\n1230\n01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:53,040\nYou got to realize that your computer\ncould actually be recording that\n\n1231\n01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,320\nin the background.\n\n1232\n01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,760\nOff set from the universal time code.\n\n1233\n01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:57,830\nOr whatever.\n\n1234\n01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:00,500\nSo Greenwich minutes time.\n\n1235\n01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,910\nGreenwich mean time I can't say it.\n\n1236\n01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:03,890\nGreenwich mean time.\n\n1237\n01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:04,600\nSee there we go.\n\n1238\n01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:08,260\nI told you there's no way I'm\ngoing to get around that.\n\n1239\n01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:12,480\nI can't say it easy enough here.\n\n1240\n01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,080\nAnd, in forensics,\n\n1241\n01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:19,340\nyou can actually use that to again,\nprove when the event did occur.\n\n1242\n01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:22,640\nRegardless of what timezone that\nthat separate computer ends up in.\n\n1243\n01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,720\nNow, I want to show you this\nbecause I was looking up,\n\n1244\n01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:29,330\nI was like well let me see if I can find\nan example of how somebody does this.\n\n1245\n01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:30,440\nThis particular length.\n\n1246\n01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,690\nAnd you can't see the whole length.\n\n1247\n01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:32,530\nThat's how long it is.\n\n1248\n01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:33,170\nOkay?\n\n1249\n01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:36,520\nIt's in the notes is what we'll have here,\nokay?\n\n1250\n01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:44,120\nBut this guy goes into\nan incredible technical you know.\n\n1251\n01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:47,550\nI didn't even realize this but,\nI mean he breaks it down like crazy.\n\n1252\n01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:49,010\nAnd I wanted to put that in there.\n\n1253\n01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:52,382\nSo you can actually see how they can\ngo in and actually take a look at\n\n1254\n01:07:52,382 --> 01:07:57,080\nthe time stamps in terms of\nthe artifacts that are actually there.\n\n1255\n01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:00,950\nIt's amazing how much in depth\n\n1256\n01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:04,350\nthat you can actually use to\nput everything together so\n\n1257\n01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:07,880\nthat you can figure out how this is\ndone in terms of computer forensics.\n\n1258\n01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:08,540\nOkay.\n\n1259\n01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:10,070\nSo I haven't read through the whole blog.\n\n1260\n01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:13,700\nI read part of this article and\nI thought man that's a great article.\n\n1261\n01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:18,680\nIf anybody is real interested in terms\nof the way that timing ends up working\n\n1262\n01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:23,130\nthere and the way that that should\noffset and does that as well.\n\n1263\n01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:25,820\nSo recording the time outsets\nmay be very important.\n\n1264\n01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:29,910\nEspecially if you're investigating what's\ngoing on so that you can show when it\n\n1265\n01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:34,345\nalso happened when you did your\nparticular investigation as well, okay.\n\n1266\n01:08:34,345 --> 01:08:35,510\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1267\n01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:41,480\nAll right, next we have taking hashes,\ntaking hashes of things and stuff.\n\n1268\n01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:45,630\nA hash, it's a one way calculation.\n\n1269\n01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:51,070\nAll right, there's different kinds of\nhashing algorithms as process that go on.\n\n1270\n01:08:51,070 --> 01:08:53,620\nAnd we get a long number.\n\n1271\n01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:54,450\nA long number.\n\n1272\n01:08:54,450 --> 01:09:00,100\nAnd taking hashes of files can be\nused to verify data integrity.\n\n1273\n01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:03,610\nTo make sure that these files\nhave not been tampered with.\n\n1274\n01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:07,940\nNow let's say that we've\ngot a Window's system.\n\n1275\n01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:13,580\nThat we can take a hash of all the files\nthe system files that are on there.\n\n1276\n01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:19,820\nNow the way with a hash works is as\nlong as the file hasn't been changed,\n\n1277\n01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:22,560\nthe hash will always\ncome out to be the same.\n\n1278\n01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,820\nSo we'll take a little\nexample here in a minute.\n\n1279\n01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:29,180\nSo let's say there are some system files.\n\n1280\n01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:32,480\nAnd we can take a hash of\nall these system files and\n\n1281\n01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,260\nwe can get a read out of\nall the different results.\n\n1282\n01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:41,020\nWell, we can compare these results to\nknown good hashes from another system.\n\n1283\n01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:46,100\nAnd so, comparing on these two we can\nthen find out what system files have been\n\n1284\n01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:53,200\ntampered with and that can kind of lead\nto a breakthrough in our investigation.\n\n1285\n01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:56,230\nYou know, the hashes are very important\nin a couple of instances here for\n\n1286\n01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:58,100\nus in what they mention.\n\n1287\n01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:01,180\nOne of them is when we first\ntake that system image, right?\n\n1288\n01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:04,740\nWe need to be able to link that image\nthat we are working with, okay?\n\n1289\n01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:08,480\nIf we're doing some type of\ntaking a look at that, you know,\n\n1290\n01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:12,220\nit shows that we didn't put something\non that particular system here.\n\n1291\n01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:15,240\nSo what we do,\nis that we can actually take an image\n\n1292\n01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:19,280\nof that particular computer hard drive,\ncreate that hash value for it.\n\n1293\n01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,980\nAnd then when we actually make the second\none in terms of the working hard drive,\n\n1294\n01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:24,850\nwe again create a hash of that one too.\n\n1295\n01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:27,510\nAnd they should be the same, okay?\n\n1296\n01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:29,790\nThey are saying that means identically,\nbit for\n\n1297\n01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:33,360\nbit, that these are actually\nthe same devices, okay?\n\n1298\n01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:36,240\nNow, if something does change here,\n\n1299\n01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:39,920\nthen that means we've manipulated\nthe image someway, somehow.\n\n1300\n01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,020\nThat's something we\ndon't really want to do.\n\n1301\n01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:46,160\nWhat we want to do is use it again as\na primary source of investigation.\n\n1302\n01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,690\nThen when it comes down to\nbeing able to present it,\n\n1303\n01:10:48,690 --> 01:10:52,610\nwe have to prove that even though\nwe're working on a copy of it,\n\n1304\n01:10:52,610 --> 01:10:57,070\nwe haven't manipulated or changed it since\nthe time we took the original image here.\n\n1305\n01:10:57,070 --> 01:11:01,180\nSo using hashes in that sense really do\nhelp to show that you know even though\n\n1306\n01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:04,700\nwe're not really working on the original\nhard drive we are working on image that's\n\n1307\n01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:08,848\na bit by bit copy of it essentially\nan exact image of what we have.\n\n1308\n01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:12,680\nSecondly what Nate mentioned\nin the comparing it to\n\n1309\n01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,530\nother files that are out there.\n\n1310\n01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:19,490\nIn the United States here, and in your\ncountry where you are may have it stored\n\n1311\n01:11:19,490 --> 01:11:26,420\ndifferently here, but there is\na place at the government here, which\n\n1312\n01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:31,470\nis the Information Technology Laboratory\nNational Software Reference Library.\n\n1313\n01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:35,980\nOkay, so again I put that link in here for\nus so we can see it, but\n\n1314\n01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:40,190\nI just wanted to actually show you\nin this paragraph right here, right?\n\n1315\n01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:43,698\nSo the design to collect software\nfrom various sources and incorporate\n\n1316\n01:11:43,698 --> 01:11:47,394\nfile profiles computed from this\nsoftware into a reference data set here.\n\n1317\n01:11:47,394 --> 01:11:53,387\nAnd it tells you that, hey,\nthis thing can be used by law enforcement.\n\n1318\n01:11:53,387 --> 01:11:55,257\nOops, I shouldn't have\ndone that somewhere.\n\n1319\n01:11:55,257 --> 01:11:57,938\nYeah, by law enforcement here, and\n\n1320\n01:11:57,938 --> 01:12:04,180\nAnother place there to provide some of\nthe different references that we have.\n\n1321\n01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:07,229\nSo if somebody has manipulated\na file on your computer and\n\n1322\n01:12:07,229 --> 01:12:10,915\nthey're saying they're running this,\nthey can compare it against\n\n1323\n01:12:10,915 --> 01:12:15,316\nthis reference source that we have,\nthat my machine is now zoomed in to 175%.\n\n1324\n01:12:15,316 --> 01:12:17,070\nFor one reason or another, that's too far.\n\n1325\n01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:20,580\nBut you kinda get the idea, okay?\n\n1326\n01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:24,275\nSo if somebody were to say, no, I'm\nrunning this, or let's say it's a copy of\n\n1327\n01:12:24,275 --> 01:12:28,192\nit, right, they can compare it to this to\nactually show whether it's the true one or\n\n1328\n01:12:28,192 --> 01:12:30,650\nwhether there's something\nelse that's going on.\n\n1329\n01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:33,833\nAnd you can now use this if\nthey're hiding data as well to\n\n1330\n01:12:33,833 --> 01:12:38,191\nbe able to compare those images and\nthose files against something else too.\n\n1331\n01:12:38,191 --> 01:12:40,927\nSo they have this library resource for\n\n1332\n01:12:40,927 --> 01:12:45,550\nus to be able to compare against\nwhen you take a look at it.\n\n1333\n01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:48,610\nSo you have a lot of\ninstances where it helps you,\n\n1334\n01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:51,340\nto show that you're not\nmanipulating any data.\n\n1335\n01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:54,590\nBut then they also have it to\nallow you to be able to compare,\n\n1336\n01:12:54,590 --> 01:12:57,900\nwell what you see on your machine\nthen something else is going on,\n\n1337\n01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:01,700\nversus what the real copy\nof that software should be.\n\n1338\n01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:05,290\nSo you know somebody's manipulating\nthe code and if you wanna sue them for\n\n1339\n01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:07,025\nit, because you can, okay?\n\n1340\n01:13:07,025 --> 01:13:10,355\nSo it's nice to help them out\nin being able to do that.\n\n1341\n01:13:10,355 --> 01:13:15,108\nSo I've included that, like I said,\nin our show notes as we go on.\n\n1342\n01:13:15,108 --> 01:13:17,365\n>> Yeah, so Ronnie, let's take a look.\n\n1343\n01:13:17,365 --> 01:13:20,850\nLet's take a little example\nto get a hash of a file.\n\n1344\n01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:21,410\n>> Sounds great.\n\n1345\n01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:23,940\n>> And seeing how these numbers change.\n\n1346\n01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:24,840\n>> Okay.\n\n1347\n01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:28,690\n>> All right, so on my PC here,\nso we'll go ahead and\n\n1348\n01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:31,830\nwe'll just create a new text document.\n\n1349\n01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:39,191\nAnd we'll just say, this is my text.\n\n1350\n01:13:39,191 --> 01:13:40,941\nAll right, fair enough.\n\n1351\n01:13:40,941 --> 01:13:43,566\nWe'll go ahead and save it.\n\n1352\n01:13:43,566 --> 01:13:45,700\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n1353\n01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:46,945\nThere is our new text document.\n\n1354\n01:13:46,945 --> 01:13:50,660\nAnd now there is a free application.\n\n1355\n01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:52,670\nThis one is called Karen's Hasher.\n\n1356\n01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:58,820\nSo we can take some files and\ncreate a hash based off those files.\n\n1357\n01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:01,440\nSo something that we'll do,\nwe've just go to add a file.\n\n1358\n01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:05,530\nAnd on the desktop,\nthere's our new text document.\n\n1359\n01:14:05,530 --> 01:14:06,200\nAnd we'll open it up.\n\n1360\n01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:09,970\nNow we have different hashing algorithms\n\n1361\n01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:12,990\nthat we can calculate\nagainst this document.\n\n1362\n01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:15,960\nMD5, SHA-1, SHA-24, and\nall this other stuff.\n\n1363\n01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:19,760\nSo the default here is SHA-1,\nwe'll go ahead and do that.\n\n1364\n01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:20,950\nWe'll click this button.\n\n1365\n01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:24,480\nAnd now it's calculated a hash\nbased off of this, all right?\n\n1366\n01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:29,108\nSo we'll just copy results to a clipboard.\n\n1367\n01:14:29,108 --> 01:14:32,870\nAnd let's open up good old Notepad,\nand paste the results.\n\n1368\n01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:36,080\nAll right, so this big long number here,\n\n1369\n01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:40,020\nthat is our hash based\noff new text document.\n\n1370\n01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:41,270\n>> All right.\n\n1371\n01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:41,790\n>> All right.\n\n1372\n01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:46,920\nSo, in that case,\nlet's open up our new text document and\n\n1373\n01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:49,270\nthen we'll just change it a little bit,\nall right?\n\n1374\n01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:51,110\nThis is not my text.\n\n1375\n01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:52,370\nOh man.\n\n1376\n01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:55,108\nWe'll go ahead and save that.\n\n1377\n01:14:55,108 --> 01:14:55,816\nWe'll close it out.\n\n1378\n01:14:58,066 --> 01:15:01,810\nAnd we'll take this right here and\nwe'll go ahead and remove it.\n\n1379\n01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:05,650\nAnd let's add that file again.\n\n1380\n01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:13,380\nAll right, we'll use the same SHA-1,\nclick to calculate.\n\n1381\n01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:15,608\nWe'll copy our results to clipboard.\n\n1382\n01:15:18,566 --> 01:15:20,480\nPaste it on there.\n\n1383\n01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:23,358\nAnd so what I'll do is just delete\nthis stuff here in the middle.\n\n1384\n01:15:26,316 --> 01:15:27,941\nI'll just delete one more line.\n\n1385\n01:15:32,608 --> 01:15:34,200\nAll right, so there we go.\n\n1386\n01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:37,660\nOne small change against\nour new text document.\n\n1387\n01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:41,610\nAnd so now we have these two\nwildly different numbers.\n\n1388\n01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:46,340\nAnd so taking a hash of that, we can show\nthat this data, that text document that\n\n1389\n01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:50,190\nwas, this is my text, and now somebody's\ngone in there and changed it.\n\n1390\n01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:52,745\nThis is now not my text.\n\n1391\n01:15:52,745 --> 01:15:54,551\nTaking a hash of it before and after,\n\n1392\n01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:57,905\nwe can show that this data has\nindeed been tampered with.\n\n1393\n01:15:57,905 --> 01:16:01,405\n>> Yeah, so this is actually\nsomething that's very important for\n\n1394\n01:16:01,405 --> 01:16:03,905\nwhat we're talking about\nin this process here.\n\n1395\n01:16:03,905 --> 01:16:06,855\nBecause what we have to\nshow in the court is that\n\n1396\n01:16:06,855 --> 01:16:09,550\nwebsite actually used is what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n1397\n01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:12,190\nAnd not necessarily a modified copy that\n\n1398\n01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:14,620\ncould've actually been\nmanipulated at some point.\n\n1399\n01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:17,350\nAnd so very important for us to\nunderstand, at least the basics here.\n\n1400\n01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:21,720\nNow, you're gonna see a hashing I think\nwhen we get into the encryption section\n\n1401\n01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:26,060\nof our security plus cryptography,\nand you'll see that a little bit more.\n\n1402\n01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:28,150\nBut for us here, this is a great example.\n\n1403\n01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:32,045\nAnd you might be wondering, like I did,\nI was like wow, what makes that number so\n\n1404\n01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:32,691\ndifferent?\n\n1405\n01:16:32,691 --> 01:16:36,069\nThere is something in terms of\nthe way the hashing out the work,\n\n1406\n01:16:36,069 --> 01:16:38,550\nthey call it the avalanche effect.\n\n1407\n01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:43,280\nA small change leads to a gigantic\noutput that's really so different\n\n1408\n01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:48,130\nthat it's very easy for us to tell that\nsomething was changed or manipulated too.\n\n1409\n01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:50,890\nSo very good in terms of hashing, okay?\n\n1410\n01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:53,652\nAll right, Nate we have screenshots.\n\n1411\n01:16:53,652 --> 01:16:59,048\n>> Yeah, so with screenshots,\nit's taking a capture of the screen or\n\n1412\n01:16:59,048 --> 01:17:01,900\nwhatever is running on the screen.\n\n1413\n01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:06,630\nNow as far as collecting evidence goes\non that very first order of volatility,\n\n1414\n01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:09,150\nwe didn't really mention screenshots.\n\n1415\n01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:09,770\n>> Nope.\n\n1416\n01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:14,610\n>> But taking a screenshot of\nwhatever is currently running.\n\n1417\n01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:20,230\nIf the attacker, whatever,\nis logged into some kind of application.\n\n1418\n01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:21,820\nAnd taking a screenshot of that,\n\n1419\n01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:27,200\non what's open, what's running,\nthose sorts of items, we can use that for.\n\n1420\n01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:32,930\nNow screenshots can also be used to\nshow the steps taken by doing something.\n\n1421\n01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:37,460\nSo we can record steps of closing\nsomething out, or copying something over,\n\n1422\n01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:38,180\nor what have you.\n\n1423\n01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:42,710\nJust taking screenshots of\nthose steps can be used\n\n1424\n01:17:42,710 --> 01:17:48,000\nto show that proper procedures\nhave been taken in that process.\n\n1425\n01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:54,410\nAnd it can also be used to show some\nproof that evidence hasn't been tampered\n\n1426\n01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:58,840\nwith if we showed a screenshot of a file\nstructure or something of that sort.\n\n1427\n01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:02,316\nWe can show this is how\nit was when I found it.\n\n1428\n01:18:02,316 --> 01:18:05,890\nAnd if the file structure or\nsomething else has been turned around or\n\n1429\n01:18:05,890 --> 01:18:10,310\nwhat have you, you know maybe nothing\nhas really been modified, or changed.\n\n1430\n01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:15,380\nBut perhaps just the order has been mixed\naround, screenshots can help show that,\n\n1431\n01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:18,540\nhey, something's changed\nsince I have last had it.\n\n1432\n01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:21,130\n>> Yeah, a lot of times where\nthis actually affects us.\n\n1433\n01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:23,720\nI have a friend that works in\nthe State Attorney's Office.\n\n1434\n01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:28,604\nAnd they have to do these, again,\nkind of little info luncheons,\n\n1435\n01:18:28,604 --> 01:18:32,373\nor whatever you wanna call\nit every once in a while.\n\n1436\n01:18:32,373 --> 01:18:35,450\nOne of the things he has convinced law\nenforcement officers about if they\n\n1437\n01:18:35,450 --> 01:18:38,479\nactually do have to worry about\ninvestigating something like this is to\n\n1438\n01:18:38,479 --> 01:18:40,130\nnot touch the computer.\n\n1439\n01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:42,530\nIt's hard for an officer when\nhe comes into the court and\n\n1440\n01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:44,860\nsays, well this is what was\non the computer screen.\n\n1441\n01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:47,230\nWell, he can't prove it, okay?\n\n1442\n01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:50,130\nBeing able to do a screenshot\nis how you prove what you\n\n1443\n01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:52,975\nfound at that particular\npoint when you can't, okay?\n\n1444\n01:18:52,975 --> 01:18:55,540\nSo one of the things I\nrecommend if you don't know it,\n\n1445\n01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:59,850\nright, is to know how to do a screenshot\non your own computer, okay?\n\n1446\n01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:01,070\nAnd try and actually figure that out for\n\n1447\n01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,710\neven other types of computer systems\nthat are actually out there.\n\n1448\n01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:07,010\nSo a lot of that, doing the print\nscreen is really the easiest one that\n\n1449\n01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:09,620\nwe can actually think about,\nmaking sure that we do.\n\n1450\n01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:14,120\nBut it is very important that\nthis stuff is gonna be used,\n\n1451\n01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:16,340\nokay, especially if you wanna try and\nprove that.\n\n1452\n01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:20,478\nJust me saying, well, here's what was on\nthe computer, doesn't actually show it,\n\n1453\n01:19:20,478 --> 01:19:22,358\nthe screenshot really does, okay?.\n\n1454\n01:19:22,358 --> 01:19:28,108\nAnd that's another part of us preserving\nthat chain of custody as well, okay?\n\n1455\n01:19:28,108 --> 01:19:29,316\n>> Witnesses.\n\n1456\n01:19:29,316 --> 01:19:30,150\n>> Witnesses.\n\n1457\n01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:30,900\n>> Witnesses.\n\n1458\n01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:31,440\n>> Witnesses.\n\n1459\n01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:36,750\nSomebody to vouch to it,\nto backup the claim,\n\n1460\n01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:40,130\nagainst how something has been happened,\nright?\n\n1461\n01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:46,618\nSo now, many times that a person can\ntestify that the collection of evidence or\n\n1462\n01:19:46,618 --> 01:19:53,715\nsomething that has happened was done in a\nproper order, and has been held correctly.\n\n1463\n01:19:53,715 --> 01:19:57,575\n>> Yeah, an example of this of course\nis that an expert testimony, right?\n\n1464\n01:19:57,575 --> 01:19:59,587\nEspecially somebody that's\ntrained in forensics here.\n\n1465\n01:19:59,587 --> 01:20:03,901\nThey again can vouch for the very fact\nthat here's what the evidence is,\n\n1466\n01:20:03,901 --> 01:20:06,530\nas well as actually\nshow that the progress.\n\n1467\n01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:09,270\nAnd the way it was done\nwas done properly as well.\n\n1468\n01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:12,290\nAnd this is something that's\nalso important in the idea and\n\n1469\n01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:16,480\nthe process here of how we respond\nin terms of forensics too.\n\n1470\n01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:21,290\nOkay, man hours, okay, so never mind.\n\n1471\n01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:22,660\nOkay, what we'll do with this.\n\n1472\n01:20:22,660 --> 01:20:25,390\nWe've got one or\na couple more points to make.\n\n1473\n01:20:25,390 --> 01:20:27,250\nAnd we've got one other\nsection I wanna cover.\n\n1474\n01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:31,530\nBut it is time for\nour break that we are coming up on here.\n\n1475\n01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:33,880\nSo let's go and do this,\nwe're gonna take a short break.\n\n1476\n01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,150\nWe'll come back for\n\n1477\n01:20:35,150 --> 01:20:40,086\nour final segment of our security contexts\nthat we'll be talking about here.\n\n1478\n01:20:40,086 --> 01:20:44,033\nAnd stay tuned, we'll be back\nright after these, this break.\n\n1479\n01:20:44,033 --> 01:20:51,521\n[MUSIC]\n\n1480\n01:20:51,521 --> 01:20:52,175\nAll right,\n\n1481\n01:20:52,175 --> 01:20:56,304\nwelcome back as we now begin the final\nsegment of this particular episode.\n\n1482\n01:20:56,304 --> 01:21:00,085\nWe were just finishing up the processes\nhere for the forensic process.\n\n1483\n01:21:00,085 --> 01:21:02,145\nWe've got a couple more\nsteps to go through.\n\n1484\n01:21:02,145 --> 01:21:04,745\nAnd then we got one more topic that\nwe've got to cover in terms of\n\n1485\n01:21:04,745 --> 01:21:07,485\ndifferent security goals\nthat we also have too, okay?\n\n1486\n01:21:07,485 --> 01:21:12,095\nSo right before, we had just finished\ntalking about the differences or\n\n1487\n01:21:12,095 --> 01:21:16,560\nthe idea of actually making sure,\nwe talked about witnesses, right,\n\n1488\n01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:18,205\nin the forensic process here.\n\n1489\n01:21:18,205 --> 01:21:21,990\nLotta times it comes down to expert\ntestimony that you know how the things\n\n1490\n01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:25,160\nwere done and you can explain that and\nit can be presented in court.\n\n1491\n01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:29,950\nAlso we need to take a look at the idea\nof tracking man hours and expenses, okay?\n\n1492\n01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:33,220\nAt one point when you did have\ncomputer crimes that would\n\n1493\n01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:34,610\nactually end up happening.\n\n1494\n01:21:34,610 --> 01:21:38,540\nIt was fairly easy to assume that they\nwere done on individual computers.\n\n1495\n01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:41,730\nAnd it really didn't take a long\ntime to actually go in and\n\n1496\n01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:44,450\ninvestigate the nature of that.\n\n1497\n01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:47,670\nSo a lotta times when you read the old\nhistory books they say it took them about\n\n1498\n01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:48,840\nunder 40 hours.\n\n1499\n01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,800\nTo actually be able to investigate\nthe entirety of what would happen on\n\n1500\n01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:52,780\nthat computer.\n\n1501\n01:21:52,780 --> 01:21:54,730\nToday though, computers are so\ninterconnected.\n\n1502\n01:21:54,730 --> 01:21:57,560\nWe never know where this\nthing's gonna trace out and\n\n1503\n01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:01,190\nhow many different computers it's\ngonna end up affecting here.\n\n1504\n01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:04,960\nSo if you are actually involved in\nsomething like this, you also wanna make\n\n1505\n01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:09,730\nsure that you're tracking the man hours in\nthis too because this gets tacked on as\n\n1506\n01:22:09,730 --> 01:22:15,150\npart of the overall cost I\nguess on the crime itself.\n\n1507\n01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:20,000\nAnd so if there's a sentence given out it\nactually gets added up and presented to\n\n1508\n01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,370\nthat company too as being part of the cost\nof having to do whatever is done here.\n\n1509\n01:22:24,370 --> 01:22:27,460\nSo let's make sure that we understand\nthat process as well, okay?\n\n1510\n01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:32,880\nNow the whole thing that we have is\nnot done just because, well okay,\n\n1511\n01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,470\nwe have nothing better to do.\n\n1512\n01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:37,500\nBut it's because we do have\nto prosecute these things.\n\n1513\n01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:41,100\nAnd, for us that means we have to make\nsure that we can preserve what we call\n\n1514\n01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:44,100\nthe idea of the chain of custody here,\nokay?\n\n1515\n01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:47,500\nMaking sure that we have this chain of\ncustody in hand here, a lotta times,\n\n1516\n01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:50,730\nthe very simple processes is that\nall of our data that we have, or\n\n1517\n01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:53,580\nour evidence here is properly labeled,\nsecured.\n\n1518\n01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:56,668\nWho's gonna be responsible for it,\nand the date that would actually,\n\n1519\n01:22:56,668 --> 01:22:58,990\nthat they're responsible for it as well.\n\n1520\n01:22:58,990 --> 01:23:03,120\nIt presents a historical timeline for\nus of that evidence, okay?\n\n1521\n01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:06,670\nHow it's being collected, analyzed,\nmoved, preserved, whatever, okay?\n\n1522\n01:23:06,670 --> 01:23:09,630\nIt gives us all that, that we have here.\n\n1523\n01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:12,890\nA way that the court will actually make\nsure that it's actually admissible as\n\n1524\n01:23:12,890 --> 01:23:13,880\nwell, okay?\n\n1525\n01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:17,740\nSo if it doesn't follow us that means\nthat stuff can be tossed out and\n\n1526\n01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:20,100\nour computer case may go away, okay?\n\n1527\n01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:22,050\nNow there's more details\nthan this in there, okay?\n\n1528\n01:23:22,050 --> 01:23:25,150\nLike say we give a high level overview,\nbut it is something that we wanna\n\n1529\n01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:29,280\nmake sure that you do understand that it's\na big part of our process here, okay?\n\n1530\n01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,350\nTate.\n\n1531\n01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:34,850\n>> Yeah, Ronnie and I, I did have one\nthought about checking man hours and\n\n1532\n01:23:34,850 --> 01:23:35,369\nexpenses.\n\n1533\n01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:43,000\nKnowing how much was spent in an amount\nof time, on how many people and\n\n1534\n01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:48,060\nthe overall cost of it, it can be added\ninto the overall damage assessment.\n\n1535\n01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:52,670\nSo then perhaps going back and\nlooking at risk calculations like,\n\n1536\n01:23:52,670 --> 01:23:57,420\nwell, to have this kind\nof incident before, or\n\n1537\n01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:01,330\nsome other company or what have you,\nthat it overall cost the company\n\n1538\n01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:05,130\nx amount of dollars to take\ncare of this kind of incident.\n\n1539\n01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:08,910\nAnd so then I can go from that\nqualitative into a quantitative.\n\n1540\n01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:13,190\nCuz it's like we know that\nit will cost about this\n\n1541\n01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:16,120\nmuch money to take care\nof this kind of incident.\n\n1542\n01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:19,852\nSo you can use it for\nfuture risk calculations.\n\n1543\n01:24:19,852 --> 01:24:23,255\n>> Yeah, absolutely,\nthat's actually a great cost for us,\n\n1544\n01:24:23,255 --> 01:24:26,462\ncuz a lotta times we don't\neven consider that, right?\n\n1545\n01:24:26,462 --> 01:24:30,182\nAnd so if we are preparing for this, what\nwe'd do is we'd learn from our incident in\n\n1546\n01:24:30,182 --> 01:24:32,271\nwhich we didn't do it,\nand we'd do it again.\n\n1547\n01:24:32,271 --> 01:24:36,650\nAnd hopefully we could actually use that\nto help us in preparing better, okay?\n\n1548\n01:24:36,650 --> 01:24:40,520\nNow, there is one small topic it seems\nlike that they just kinda lumped in here.\n\n1549\n01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:44,720\nBut it does follow underneath some\nof the forensic processes well,\n\n1550\n01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:48,642\nwhich is that big data, right,\nthe big data analysis that we have, okay?\n\n1551\n01:24:48,642 --> 01:24:52,350\nNow we take a look at this\nidea of big data analysis.\n\n1552\n01:24:52,350 --> 01:24:55,300\nWhy in the world would they put it\nunderneath this forensic process?\n\n1553\n01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:59,980\nIt is because of how much data\nusually is gathered a lotta times\n\n1554\n01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:03,840\noff the machines involved in some\ntype of activity here that could be,\n\n1555\n01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:06,240\nagain, actionable in a court, okay?\n\n1556\n01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:09,210\nAnd that means that sometimes\npeople can actually pull off\n\n1557\n01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:11,430\nterabytes of data off the machine.\n\n1558\n01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:13,620\nNow, at one point we would have\njust said gigabytes of data and\n\n1559\n01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:15,280\nit would have just blown people's minds.\n\n1560\n01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,602\nToday we have to use the term terabytes,\nokay?\n\n1561\n01:25:17,602 --> 01:25:20,750\nBut there's so\nmuch data that is gathered, right?\n\n1562\n01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:26,580\nA terabyte is 1 million megabytes.\n\n1563\n01:25:27,770 --> 01:25:31,256\nNow 1 million, 1 billion?\n\n1564\n01:25:31,256 --> 01:25:32,387\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> 1,000 gigs.\n\n1565\n01:25:32,387 --> 01:25:33,409\n>> 1,000 gigs.\n\n1566\n01:25:33,409 --> 01:25:36,903\nSo as you break that down,\nis a ton of data.\n\n1567\n01:25:36,903 --> 01:25:41,164\nAnd even if you were to assign ten\npeople to inspect all that data,\n\n1568\n01:25:41,164 --> 01:25:45,000\nit could take an incredible\namount of time to do so, okay?\n\n1569\n01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,781\nSo big data analysis here.\n\n1570\n01:25:46,781 --> 01:25:49,590\nTake some into consideration\nthree particular factors here\n\n1571\n01:25:49,590 --> 01:25:51,910\nthat I always use to describe big data,\nokay?\n\n1572\n01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:54,520\nThey call it the three Vs, okay?\n\n1573\n01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:56,610\nThere is so much volume of data out there.\n\n1574\n01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:58,120\nIt's amazing, okay?\n\n1575\n01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:03,295\nThe velocity, the speed in which data\nmoves, okay, and how fast it actually gets\n\n1576\n01:26:03,295 --> 01:26:09,455\ntransmitted in and out is incredible and\nthen the sheer variety of the data, okay?\n\n1577\n01:26:09,455 --> 01:26:12,235\nSo what did you end up\nwith a lot of times here?\n\n1578\n01:26:12,235 --> 01:26:15,745\nIf you're looking for information it\nis essentially a needle in a haystack.\n\n1579\n01:26:15,745 --> 01:26:19,875\nAnd people bury it, they obfuscate\nit in this way, okay, to do this.\n\n1580\n01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:23,830\nIt was years ago but there was some movie\n\n1581\n01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:27,380\nthat was talking about the way\nthat they ask for evidence, right?\n\n1582\n01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:29,760\nThat they said hey here is\nwhat we're looking for.\n\n1583\n01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,640\nWell what the company does is they sent\nevery piece of evidence to some small\n\n1584\n01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:34,830\nlittle law firm.\n\n1585\n01:26:34,830 --> 01:26:38,870\nAnd it turned out to be something\nlike 50,000 pages of documents.\n\n1586\n01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:42,450\nAnd they had to find one sheet\nof paper in that 50,000 here.\n\n1587\n01:26:42,450 --> 01:26:45,380\nWell the big data is actually\nsomething like that.\n\n1588\n01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:49,470\nThe very fact is that this data's so\nlarge that conventional,\n\n1589\n01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:53,840\nrelational database management\nsystems can't handle it, okay?\n\n1590\n01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,550\nSo there are companies out there\nthat really do help, okay?\n\n1591\n01:26:57,550 --> 01:27:00,790\nTo try and actually be able to\ndo this type of analysis here.\n\n1592\n01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:02,610\nOkay, to help us out here.\n\n1593\n01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:05,550\nBut remember that a lotta\ntimes the unstructured nature,\n\n1594\n01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:08,470\nthe very fact that it doesn't actually\nreside in a traditional database,\n\n1595\n01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:10,800\nmakes it almost impossible to find.\n\n1596\n01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,390\nBut these are things in which people\nare coming up with to try and\n\n1597\n01:27:13,390 --> 01:27:14,820\nfigure out how to do this.\n\n1598\n01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:16,730\nSo that's the idea of big data.\n\n1599\n01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:20,950\nAnything else here on-\n>> No, that about wraps it up and\n\n1600\n01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:23,500\nit does conclude on our 2.4.\n\n1601\n01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:29,540\nOur set of objectives on the forensic\nprocess, steps that we need to take,\n\n1602\n01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:35,590\nthings that we can do to make sure\nthat our evidence isn't tampered with.\n\n1603\n01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:38,670\nThat we can track how it's collected,\n\n1604\n01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:42,440\nwhere it's stored from the very\nbeginning up until presentation.\n\n1605\n01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:44,380\n>> Yeah, so there's a lot there for us.\n\n1606\n01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:46,580\nSo, make sure you take the time.\n\n1607\n01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:49,320\nYou take the time to go\nback through this and\n\n1608\n01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:52,870\ntake a look at those processes that\nare actually in place for you.\n\n1609\n01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:53,489\nUnderstand the importance of this.\n\n1610\n01:27:53,489 --> 01:27:56,770\nThat it really all relates to the very\nfact that it's about the chain of custody\n\n1611\n01:27:56,770 --> 01:27:58,569\nthat has to kind of fall in line here for\nus.\n\n1612\n01:27:58,569 --> 01:28:03,323\nSo that this information can be admissible\nin a court of law as well, okay?\n\n1613\n01:28:03,323 --> 01:28:09,210\nThat means we are ready to move on to our\nfinal particular topic of today here.\n\n1614\n01:28:09,210 --> 01:28:10,508\nGiven a scenario,\n\n1615\n01:28:10,508 --> 01:28:15,660\nselect the appropriate controls to\nmeet security goals here, okay?\n\n1616\n01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:18,808\nNow, before we get started in\nall these processes here, okay,\n\n1617\n01:28:18,808 --> 01:28:20,044\nlet's talk about this.\n\n1618\n01:28:20,044 --> 01:28:22,926\nSo Nate, what is this\ntraditionally called for us here?\n\n1619\n01:28:22,926 --> 01:28:26,586\n>> The security triad.\n\n1620\n01:28:26,586 --> 01:28:30,460\n>> Yeah, sometimes you hear\nthe security triad, the CIA Triad.\n\n1621\n01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:33,140\nYou may hear the iron\ntriangle of security.\n\n1622\n01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:35,280\nYou name it, there's a ton of them.\n\n1623\n01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:38,237\nAccording to CompTIA,\nyou find this term anywhere,\n\n1624\n01:28:38,237 --> 01:28:40,745\nit's probably called the CIA Triad, okay?\n\n1625\n01:28:41,885 --> 01:28:48,065\nIn security and IT security information\nsystem, security for us, every single\n\n1626\n01:28:48,065 --> 01:28:52,025\nimplementation of security that we have,\nwhatever control that we put in place,\n\n1627\n01:28:52,025 --> 01:28:56,375\nwhatever policies that we put in place,\nwhatever practices that we put in place,\n\n1628\n01:28:56,375 --> 01:29:01,350\nshould help us to meet these three\noverarching goals of security.\n\n1629\n01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:04,960\nIf not, it's probably not worth\nputting into place here, okay.\n\n1630\n01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,850\nThe reason for this is it's very easy for\n\n1631\n01:29:06,850 --> 01:29:11,260\nme to say I know what security\nthat I want in my company, okay?\n\n1632\n01:29:11,260 --> 01:29:14,108\nBut what if it doesn't really fit\nthe needs of my company here?\n\n1633\n01:29:14,108 --> 01:29:20,020\nSo a lotta times when we start actually\nbeginning to put into place practices and\n\n1634\n01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:20,800\ndevices and\n\n1635\n01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:24,630\neverything, we wanna make sure that helps\nus to meet these three overarching goals.\n\n1636\n01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:28,990\nConfidentiality for us is about keeping\nthe data, as private as we can.\n\n1637\n01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:35,180\nBasic integrity for us is ensuring\nthat we can make sure that somebody\n\n1638\n01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:37,960\nhasn't messed with the data is, I guess,\nthe easiest one, and where it came from.\n\n1639\n01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:39,030\nAnd then availability,\n\n1640\n01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:41,108\nmaking sure it's actually only\navailable to who we want it to be.\n\n1641\n01:29:41,108 --> 01:29:44,540\nNow, we're gonna take a look at some of\nthe different ways that we can ensure this\n\n1642\n01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:45,300\nhappens here, okay?\n\n1643\n01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:48,760\nAll right, so, Nate, which one are we\ngoing to take a look at first?\n\n1644\n01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:51,600\n>> You'll wanna start at the top\nwith good old confidentiality.\n\n1645\n01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:52,260\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1646\n01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:56,160\n>> So, confidentiality,\nkeeping our information safe.\n\n1647\n01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:59,450\nMaking sure that only those\nwho are authorized to\n\n1648\n01:29:59,450 --> 01:30:04,640\nsee it are the ones that see it and\nit kinda stays right there.\n\n1649\n01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:08,000\n>> Yeah, so when we take a look\nat the idea of confidentiality,\n\n1650\n01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,620\nright, we're really talking about\nsome of the different things that\n\n1651\n01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:12,640\nwe put in place with our data, okay?\n\n1652\n01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:14,710\nFirst thing that we generally do,\nof course,\n\n1653\n01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:20,070\nto keep privacy going on here,\nis the idea of encryption, okay?\n\n1654\n01:30:20,070 --> 01:30:22,590\nEncryption for us is not only about,\n\n1655\n01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:26,970\nno, I should say not only,\nnot only about the data itself.\n\n1656\n01:30:26,970 --> 01:30:28,800\nWhen we start doing\nthe idea of encryption,\n\n1657\n01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,980\nthe making sure that it's\nactually held private.\n\n1658\n01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:34,420\nBut it's also about the key\nthat is used in the encryption.\n\n1659\n01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:36,960\nIf we're gonna actually be doing\nencryption, we have to ensure that there's\n\n1660\n01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:42,480\nprivacy of the data itself as well as the\nencryption key used to encrypt the data.\n\n1661\n01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,640\nIf I protect the data but\n\n1662\n01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:47,350\nI don't protect the key well I really\ndidn't protect the data, okay?\n\n1663\n01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:51,990\nSo when we send data across the Internet,\nokay,\n\n1664\n01:30:51,990 --> 01:30:55,515\nespecially if it's sensitive data, we\nwanna make sure it is running encryption,\n\n1665\n01:30:55,515 --> 01:30:57,450\nwanna make sure that the data's encrypted.\n\n1666\n01:30:57,450 --> 01:31:00,378\nYou wanna make sure that the key\nthat's used to encrypt or\n\n1667\n01:31:00,378 --> 01:31:03,270\ndecrypt the data is also\ngonna be protected.\n\n1668\n01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:07,538\nSo any time I'm putting anything\nonto a wire, or across the air,\n\n1669\n01:31:07,538 --> 01:31:12,430\nthat's not gonna be running just\ninside of my own network wires.\n\n1670\n01:31:12,430 --> 01:31:16,054\nI'm gonna wanna make sure that I\nactually send it encrypted, right?\n\n1671\n01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:20,250\n>> Yep, so with the encryption\nwe've got our data at rest.\n\n1672\n01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:25,000\nSo things like with Windows EFS right,\nencrypting files systems.\n\n1673\n01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,020\nSo we can use that to\nencrypt individual files.\n\n1674\n01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:30,390\nWe can also use things like BitLocker or\n\n1675\n01:31:30,390 --> 01:31:33,520\nthings like TrueCrypt to\nencrypt the entire disk.\n\n1676\n01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:38,260\nSo as it sits there, it is encrypted,\nnobody can get through it.\n\n1677\n01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:40,479\nI'll say about data on the move, right?\n\n1678\n01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:42,880\nIt's on the wire or through the air.\n\n1679\n01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:47,220\nWe can use things like IPSec,\nVPN tunnels that we can use\n\n1680\n01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:52,160\nto make sure that our data is\nencrypted that people can't get to it.\n\n1681\n01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:55,625\nOr if they can get to it,\nit's all just a jumbled old mess,\n\n1682\n01:31:55,625 --> 01:31:57,205\nand nobody can really do anything with it.\n\n1683\n01:31:57,205 --> 01:31:58,485\n>> All right, yeah.\n\n1684\n01:31:58,485 --> 01:32:02,025\nSo making sure that we have the ability\nto have our data private, and\n\n1685\n01:32:02,025 --> 01:32:03,875\nthe encryption part of it private,\n\n1686\n01:32:03,875 --> 01:32:08,325\nis a way one of these security goals\nthat we actually can put in place.\n\n1687\n01:32:08,325 --> 01:32:11,045\nEncryption for us is the key, okay?\n\n1688\n01:32:11,045 --> 01:32:14,520\nAccess control, as well,\nis another key for us.\n\n1689\n01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:17,120\nThis is for\nus limiting the authorization, okay.\n\n1690\n01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:21,680\nIn other words, not all of data needs\nto actually be accessed by everyone.\n\n1691\n01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:23,690\nSo the way to again ensure privacy,\n\n1692\n01:32:23,690 --> 01:32:27,795\nis to actually eliminate those that really\ndon't need to have access to the data.\n\n1693\n01:32:27,795 --> 01:32:31,315\nAnd we can do this through\nActive Directory membership, right?\n\n1694\n01:32:31,315 --> 01:32:34,335\nThe very fact that we can actually\ndo that with a membership inside of\n\n1695\n01:32:34,335 --> 01:32:36,125\nan Active Directory domain.\n\n1696\n01:32:36,125 --> 01:32:37,495\nOr even on my own computer,\n\n1697\n01:32:37,495 --> 01:32:41,745\nI might actually create accounts for\neverybody to gain access.\n\n1698\n01:32:41,745 --> 01:32:45,235\nAnd I may not even allow you to touch\nmy computer if I don't want to.\n\n1699\n01:32:45,235 --> 01:32:47,770\nSo that is another access\ncontrol that we had.\n\n1700\n01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:49,284\nLocking down our devices here,\n\n1701\n01:32:49,284 --> 01:32:52,260\nmaking sure that we have what\ngood password possibilities.\n\n1702\n01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:54,160\nAll these are another one, okay?\n\n1703\n01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:58,130\nBut the idea of authorization limitation\nI think is pretty much the key here.\n\n1704\n01:32:58,130 --> 01:33:02,040\nSo, any place that we actually have to\nlimit the idea of authorization, again,\n\n1705\n01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:06,240\nthis helps us to meet the overall goals\nof confidentiality as well, okay?\n\n1706\n01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:10,460\nNow, Nate, let's talk about\nthe idea of steganography here, and\n\n1707\n01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:13,745\nNate has a good demo for us, or\nat least a good example of it.\n\n1708\n01:33:13,745 --> 01:33:18,580\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, steganography,\nto take some data and\n\n1709\n01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:21,270\nhide it within something else.\n\n1710\n01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:22,950\nAnd it's incredibly cool.\n\n1711\n01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:26,770\nThe way that all this stuff\nworks where we can take a file.\n\n1712\n01:33:26,770 --> 01:33:27,920\nWe can take some text.\n\n1713\n01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:33,799\nWe can take something and\nwe can implant it into a separate file.\n\n1714\n01:33:33,799 --> 01:33:38,486\nSo we can take some text and\nwe can implant it into a picture, for\n\n1715\n01:33:38,486 --> 01:33:40,172\nexample, or an MP3.\n\n1716\n01:33:40,172 --> 01:33:44,414\nAnd so there is just enough\nlittle bytes within that file\n\n1717\n01:33:44,414 --> 01:33:49,650\nthat are changed to where just\nlooking at it or listening to it.\n\n1718\n01:33:49,650 --> 01:33:51,970\nYou wouldn't be able to\ntell anything is changed.\n\n1719\n01:33:51,970 --> 01:33:56,620\nBut running it through a special\ntool with the password for\n\n1720\n01:33:56,620 --> 01:34:00,740\nit, and it can extract that\ndata out of the picture or\n\n1721\n01:34:00,740 --> 01:34:05,430\nout of that MP3 file or\nwhat have you to get the secret message.\n\n1722\n01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:09,990\nSo you can take something, a secret\nmessage, put it inside this picture.\n\n1723\n01:34:09,990 --> 01:34:10,980\nEmail it.\n\n1724\n01:34:10,980 --> 01:34:15,960\nPost it up onto a website or a message\nboard, or Ronnie's Pinterest page.\n\n1725\n01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:19,680\nAnd then others can go and download it,\nright, nobody really knows.\n\n1726\n01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:20,588\nNone the wiser.\n\n1727\n01:34:20,588 --> 01:34:26,451\nAnd then run it against the program and\npull that secret message right out of it.\n\n1728\n01:34:26,451 --> 01:34:28,053\n>> Yeah, true that.\n\n1729\n01:34:28,053 --> 01:34:29,433\n>> Yeah, pretty sweet.\n\n1730\n01:34:29,433 --> 01:34:32,708\nSo should we take a peek at it?\n\n1731\n01:34:32,708 --> 01:34:35,700\n>> Yeah, let's take a peek at it\nas we're doing this here, okay?\n\n1732\n01:34:35,700 --> 01:34:38,770\nNow, while Nate's showing\nus this idea here, okay,\n\n1733\n01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:41,970\nthere's a phrase that I want you\nto kind of become familiar with.\n\n1734\n01:34:41,970 --> 01:34:44,280\nEspecially when they talk about\nthe idea of steganography.\n\n1735\n01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:48,790\nA lot of times you hear about\nthe phrase security through obscurity.\n\n1736\n01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:52,210\nOkay, so that's what we're really doing\nis we're actually obfuscating the data.\n\n1737\n01:34:52,210 --> 01:34:55,888\nWe're hiding the data in plain site\nis what we're actually technically\n\n1738\n01:34:55,888 --> 01:34:56,558\ndoing here.\n\n1739\n01:34:56,558 --> 01:34:59,926\nAnd so Nate's gonna show us an example\nof something that he actually found\n\n1740\n01:34:59,926 --> 01:35:00,481\nout there.\n\n1741\n01:35:00,481 --> 01:35:01,979\nWhat's it called, OpenPuff?\n\n1742\n01:35:01,979 --> 01:35:08,770\n>> Yep, OpenPuff is a steganography tool,\nand it can do a whole bunch of stuff here.\n\n1743\n01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:12,330\nWe'll just take a very simple\nexample of using something.\n\n1744\n01:35:12,330 --> 01:35:15,574\nSomething like this.\nNow there is a picture here, right?\n\n1745\n01:35:15,574 --> 01:35:19,270\nA picture here should\nlook pretty familiar.\n\n1746\n01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:23,000\nNow what we could do,\nwe could fire up Karen's Hasher and\n\n1747\n01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:27,540\nwe can take a hash against this one here,\nwhich is the original.\n\n1748\n01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:34,951\nIt's untouched and inside this OpenPuff\nfolder there is another document.\n\n1749\n01:35:34,951 --> 01:35:36,032\n>> Hey, looks the same.\n\n1750\n01:35:36,032 --> 01:35:39,200\n>> Let me kinda drag that off to the side,\nlet me click on this one.\n\n1751\n01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:43,470\nSure enough, they look dadgum identical,\nbut they're not.\n\n1752\n01:35:43,470 --> 01:35:47,160\nThe second one I opened up\ncontains a hidden message.\n\n1753\n01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:49,354\nLooking at it,\nyou can't really tell right away.\n\n1754\n01:35:49,354 --> 01:35:53,724\nSo I knew we could pull a hash against\nit to show that the file has indeed been\n\n1755\n01:35:53,724 --> 01:35:54,367\nchanged.\n\n1756\n01:35:54,367 --> 01:35:55,967\nSo what we'll do,\nlet me just drag that back over.\n\n1757\n01:35:55,967 --> 01:36:02,570\nSo using this program here, so\nI've hidden a secret message inside there.\n\n1758\n01:36:02,570 --> 01:36:05,455\nSo we can choose to Unhide it.\n\n1759\n01:36:05,455 --> 01:36:09,864\nLet's drag this little guy over here,\nshorten it up just a little bit,\n\n1760\n01:36:09,864 --> 01:36:11,050\nI guess we cannot.\n\n1761\n01:36:13,030 --> 01:36:16,753\nNow, we're gonna have three different\npasswords onto this but for us,\n\n1762\n01:36:16,753 --> 01:36:17,980\nwe'll just chose one.\n\n1763\n01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:25,400\nSo, I will uncheck those and then, put in\nthe password that I used to lock it down.\n\n1764\n01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:33,670\nSo, now, we need to select the file\nthat has the hidden message inside.\n\n1765\n01:36:33,670 --> 01:36:37,630\nIn this open folder,\nthere is that file, just open it up.\n\n1766\n01:36:38,910 --> 01:36:43,925\nAnd then, what we'll do is just click\non unhide, its gonna go do its thing.\n\n1767\n01:36:43,925 --> 01:36:49,068\nAnd we gotta pick a folder of where it's\ngonna go and just inside this open folder.\n\n1768\n01:36:49,068 --> 01:36:53,631\nSo, we're gonna see over here that we\ntake take a look at the files over there.\n\n1769\n01:36:53,631 --> 01:36:58,834\nSo, we'll just dump it in the opened\nup folder, we'll click on OK,\n\n1770\n01:36:58,834 --> 01:37:03,524\nand sure enough,\nprocessed a new document has now appeared.\n\n1771\n01:37:03,524 --> 01:37:06,020\nSo, we've got our little report.\n\n1772\n01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:09,404\nSo, now,\nwe've got the text document that I\n\n1773\n01:37:09,404 --> 01:37:13,710\nhad hidden in the message\nbefore just on break.\n\n1774\n01:37:13,710 --> 01:37:15,536\nAnd opened up, sure enough,\nthis a secret document.\n\n1775\n01:37:15,536 --> 01:37:16,059\n>> There you go.\n\n1776\n01:37:16,059 --> 01:37:20,683\n>> So, this text file was hidden inside\nof that picture and looking at it,\n\n1777\n01:37:20,683 --> 01:37:22,880\nyou couldn't even tell.\n\n1778\n01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,368\nThere go, we've now hold that to\nyour document out of that picture.\n\n1779\n01:37:26,368 --> 01:37:31,260\n>> We do wanna make sure that you\nunderstand that this is not an encryption.\n\n1780\n01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:35,670\nSo, all we're doing is we're actually\nhiding the actual information in it.\n\n1781\n01:37:35,670 --> 01:37:38,810\nSo, there's no other way or\nno other process that we have\n\n1782\n01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:41,319\nwhich is actually protecting\nthis besides the idea of hiding.\n\n1783\n01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:44,030\nSo, do make sure that you understand that.\n\n1784\n01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:48,403\nSo, a lot of times, remember that phrase,\nsecurity through obscurity here,\n\n1785\n01:37:48,403 --> 01:37:51,879\nas well as the idea of data\nobfuscation is what also have there.\n\n1786\n01:37:51,879 --> 01:37:56,587\nSo, all those different methods here,\nand why we might choose to use it again,\n\n1787\n01:37:56,587 --> 01:38:00,610\nthose are actually different\nscenarios that we may actually have.\n\n1788\n01:38:00,610 --> 01:38:04,620\nWhere we don't have the ability\nto have someone on the other end.\n\n1789\n01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:07,520\nThat may not have the same\nencryption level that you do, but\n\n1790\n01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:08,860\nyou still need to get information.\n\n1791\n01:38:08,860 --> 01:38:09,380\nYou might do it.\n\n1792\n01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:10,040\nMost of the time,\n\n1793\n01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:14,280\nwe're probably not gonna see it used\nvery much in a productive environment.\n\n1794\n01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:19,415\nSecondly, here,\nwe're gonna take a look at integrity.\n\n1795\n01:38:19,415 --> 01:38:20,170\n>> Yeah, Integrity.\n\n1796\n01:38:20,170 --> 01:38:24,434\nNow, integrity to make sure that our\ndata has not been tampered with,\n\n1797\n01:38:24,434 --> 01:38:27,973\nthat it is genuine,\nthat when it's left from one place and\n\n1798\n01:38:27,973 --> 01:38:30,812\nit's gone to the other\nthat it is unmodified.\n\n1799\n01:38:30,812 --> 01:38:35,899\nSo, that we can be sure that whoever sent\nit that person is who he says he is and\n\n1800\n01:38:35,899 --> 01:38:38,285\nthat the information that he sent,\n\n1801\n01:38:38,285 --> 01:38:41,990\nis indeed the information\nthat he meant to be sending.\n\n1802\n01:38:41,990 --> 01:38:42,690\n>> Yeah.\n\n1803\n01:38:42,690 --> 01:38:47,510\nSo for us here, in terms of integrity,\nwe tend to use things like hashing,\n\n1804\n01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:50,520\ndigital signatures, and\ncertificates to help us out here.\n\n1805\n01:38:51,530 --> 01:38:55,980\nSo, by using these picker types\nof tool here, the hashing tool,\n\n1806\n01:38:55,980 --> 01:39:00,572\nagain, is something that we, actually\nNate, has shown a little bit earlier here.\n\n1807\n01:39:00,572 --> 01:39:04,310\nSo, that we can actually be able\nto verify that nothing has changed\n\n1808\n01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:05,550\nin the document as well.\n\n1809\n01:39:06,650 --> 01:39:12,200\nThe use of digital signatures helps us\nto identify really who sent the data.\n\n1810\n01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:16,170\nAnd there is something else\nthat it also does as well,\n\n1811\n01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:19,970\nwhich is what we call non-repudiation\nat the same time here.\n\n1812\n01:39:19,970 --> 01:39:23,498\nBut digital signatures really\ndo lock in that content and\n\n1813\n01:39:23,498 --> 01:39:25,710\nwho actually sent that data for us.\n\n1814\n01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:30,581\nAnd lastly, we have the idea of digital\ncertificates again, being on a verified,\n\n1815\n01:39:30,581 --> 01:39:34,688\nthat particular sender and who they are,\nby not having to depend on any\n\n1816\n01:39:34,688 --> 01:39:39,410\none particular software or\nhardware that's actually out there too.\n\n1817\n01:39:39,410 --> 01:39:40,370\nSo, there's a lot of this.\n\n1818\n01:39:40,370 --> 01:39:43,690\nAgain, you actually see it a little\nbit further on down the road and\n\n1819\n01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:48,500\nin our episodes as we continue on through\nour security plus track here, as well.\n\n1820\n01:39:50,295 --> 01:39:53,945\nAnything specific here that you\nwant to call out in the integrity?\n\n1821\n01:39:53,945 --> 01:39:56,055\n>> Yeah, not in integrity.\n\n1822\n01:39:56,055 --> 01:39:57,815\n>> Okay.\n>> But with availability.\n\n1823\n01:39:57,815 --> 01:40:01,000\nSo, that's the A on our CIA triad.\n\n1824\n01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:06,312\nAvailability, we can make our\ninformation really secure.\n\n1825\n01:40:06,312 --> 01:40:07,452\nWe can lock it down.\n\n1826\n01:40:07,452 --> 01:40:10,572\nWe can make sure that nobody\ncan really get to it.\n\n1827\n01:40:10,572 --> 01:40:14,712\nBut on that triangle,\nwhen we move towards something else,\n\n1828\n01:40:14,712 --> 01:40:19,342\nlike towards confidentiality,\nthen something else has to suffer from it.\n\n1829\n01:40:19,342 --> 01:40:22,642\nSo, if we make our data really,\nreally secure, it is locked down.\n\n1830\n01:40:22,642 --> 01:40:25,380\nIt is on a PC that's powered off.\n\n1831\n01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:28,810\nIn a safe, that's in a closet,\nwith a guard next to it.\n\n1832\n01:40:28,810 --> 01:40:29,732\nWell, that's great.\n\n1833\n01:40:29,732 --> 01:40:32,880\nWe're gonna make sure that the data\nwill not be tampered with.\n\n1834\n01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:36,470\nThat it's super secured and\nthat unauthorized people cannot get to it.\n\n1835\n01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:41,870\nBut it isn't very available for\nus to get to mess with it,\n\n1836\n01:40:41,870 --> 01:40:46,840\nso availability, to make sure that our\ndata is out there, that we can get to it.\n\n1837\n01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:50,510\nSo, things like redundancy,\nthings like fault tolerance.\n\n1838\n01:40:50,510 --> 01:40:54,280\nSo, we can have our hard drive\nset up in a raid configuration,\n\n1839\n01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:58,340\nwe can make the appropriate backups,\nwe can spread these around.\n\n1840\n01:40:58,340 --> 01:41:01,280\nIf we have all of our backups\nin one location, and then,\n\n1841\n01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:06,070\nwe have a our building fire, it doesn't\nreally do us any good, you or I.\n\n1842\n01:41:06,070 --> 01:41:08,671\nThe whole array set up that we had,\n\n1843\n01:41:08,671 --> 01:41:13,803\nour tapes upon tapes of backups wiped out,\nhaving offsite backup.\n\n1844\n01:41:13,803 --> 01:41:18,405\nLittle strategies on things that we can do\nto make sure that our data stays available\n\n1845\n01:41:18,405 --> 01:41:19,378\nout there.\n\n1846\n01:41:19,378 --> 01:41:23,460\nBut we've gotta make sure that\nwe can get to it when we do and\n\n1847\n01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:26,540\nthat it is always available\nin the event of any disaster.\n\n1848\n01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:27,040\n>> All right, yep.\n\n1849\n01:41:28,340 --> 01:41:30,847\nAnd lastly, they call out here\nin terms of availability,\n\n1850\n01:41:30,847 --> 01:41:32,598\nthe idea of packing your system as well.\n\n1851\n01:41:32,598 --> 01:41:35,486\nPart of that making sure that your\ncomputers are actually up to date\n\n1852\n01:41:35,486 --> 01:41:36,115\nand patched.\n\n1853\n01:41:36,115 --> 01:41:38,890\nAnd it's really part of that availability.\n\n1854\n01:41:38,890 --> 01:41:41,670\nBecause if you don't, it could be that\nwhere you get malicious software on your\n\n1855\n01:41:41,670 --> 01:41:44,510\ncomputer that takes advantage\nof an unpatched system,\n\n1856\n01:41:44,510 --> 01:41:47,920\nand that's where we also have\nto make sure of as well.\n\n1857\n01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:52,900\nSo, keeping everything up to date\nis kind of an important one too.\n\n1858\n01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:55,500\nSo, those are the three\nmajor goals that we have.\n\n1859\n01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:59,760\nNow, they kinda threw in\nnon-repudiation at some point here but\n\n1860\n01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:02,167\nI just kind of separated it off here.\n\n1861\n01:42:02,167 --> 01:42:04,117\nRemember, that if you're doing integrity,\n\n1862\n01:42:04,117 --> 01:42:07,770\nyou're actually doing the idea of\nnon-repudiation a lot of times as well.\n\n1863\n01:42:07,770 --> 01:42:11,931\nIf you essentially meet the same goals as\nthe integrity, you will also end up doing\n\n1864\n01:42:11,931 --> 01:42:15,205\nthe non-repudiation cuz it proves\nwho actually sent the data.\n\n1865\n01:42:15,205 --> 01:42:19,390\nIt can also prove that the data\nhas not been manipulated.\n\n1866\n01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:21,770\nAnd then, whoever actually\nsent the data can't refute it,\n\n1867\n01:42:21,770 --> 01:42:23,830\nbecause it can only come\nfrom that one machine.\n\n1868\n01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:27,240\nSo, you will also get that\nas an advantage as well.\n\n1869\n01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:32,220\nSo, anytime that you're actually using\nthe three aspects of what you see\n\n1870\n01:42:32,220 --> 01:42:36,490\nin under integrity, you're also gonna\nget non-repudiation as a side benefit or\n\n1871\n01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:41,170\na side goal in what's gonna happen.\n\n1872\n01:42:41,170 --> 01:42:45,277\n>> Now, the last little point that\nwe have on there with safety.\n\n1873\n01:42:45,277 --> 01:42:50,464\nIt doesn't really quite fit into\nthe CIA tryout, but this is a new,\n\n1874\n01:42:50,464 --> 01:42:54,666\nlittle subpoint here on\nthe 401 set of objectives.\n\n1875\n01:42:54,666 --> 01:43:00,093\nThe idea of safety for\nmeeting our goals of security.\n\n1876\n01:43:00,093 --> 01:43:04,739\nAnd it lists out a couple of\nthe examples here, fencing and lighting,\n\n1877\n01:43:04,739 --> 01:43:06,095\nlocks on our doors.\n\n1878\n01:43:06,095 --> 01:43:10,700\nSo, some physical security controls\nthat we can have on there,\n\n1879\n01:43:10,700 --> 01:43:13,872\nCCTV are Closed Circuit Televisions.\n\n1880\n01:43:13,872 --> 01:43:16,960\nWe're gonna have our guard\nsitting in a little guard booth\n\n1881\n01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:21,050\nsomewhere with a big fancy array of\nmonitors like on the TV shows, so\n\n1882\n01:43:21,050 --> 01:43:23,580\nthat they can see everybody and\nzoom in on their little cameras.\n\n1883\n01:43:24,930 --> 01:43:29,240\nVarious things now, in the event\nof a disaster, so in our incident\n\n1884\n01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:34,490\nresponse policies,\nlet's say, there is a fire.\n\n1885\n01:43:34,490 --> 01:43:36,800\nWe need ways to get out of that building.\n\n1886\n01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:42,570\nSo, we have things like escape plans or\na panic rooms [LAUGH],\n\n1887\n01:43:42,570 --> 01:43:45,940\na little concrete room to run into.\n\n1888\n01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:50,327\nYeah, escape plans, drills, power\ndrills cuz we have to drill out locks.\n\n1889\n01:43:50,327 --> 01:43:50,989\nJust kidding.\n\n1890\n01:43:50,989 --> 01:43:52,905\nNo, because we gotta run through things.\n\n1891\n01:43:52,905 --> 01:43:58,300\nWe gotta make sure that everybody is on\nthe same page that they are aware of what\n\n1892\n01:43:58,300 --> 01:44:04,027\nhappens in the event of a disaster and\nof course, the escape routes escape plans,\n\n1893\n01:44:04,027 --> 01:44:06,659\nwhat the They are the same\n>> Yeah same\n\n1894\n01:44:06,659 --> 01:44:09,572\nthing\n>> Testing control so really all this\n\n1895\n01:44:09,572 --> 01:44:14,786\nstuff right creating our backups well\nthe backup doesn't really do any good\n\n1896\n01:44:14,786 --> 01:44:20,950\nbecause we haven't tested the backups\nwe could have a whole archived library.\n\n1897\n01:44:20,950 --> 01:44:22,200\nOf bad backups.\n\n1898\n01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:28,620\nSo we can't have all these fencing and\nlighting but if we don't test things,\n\n1899\n01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:33,260\nif we don't run through these drills,\nremember in elementary\n\n1900\n01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:38,070\nschool where they'd call out on the PA\nwe're going to have a fire drill today.\n\n1901\n01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:41,500\nEverybody just be cool about it and\neverything, it's not a real fire.\n\n1902\n01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:44,750\nAnd then you're doing your homework or\nwhatever, and the fire alarms go off.\n\n1903\n01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:48,040\nAnd everybody just bolts for the door,\nshoving and kicking over desks.\n\n1904\n01:44:48,040 --> 01:44:49,560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And there's not a fire.\n\n1905\n01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:51,460\nBut we have to test things.\n\n1906\n01:44:51,460 --> 01:44:52,860\n>> Right.\n>> We have to test it out so\n\n1907\n01:44:52,860 --> 01:44:55,290\nthat we can be sure that the policies and\n\n1908\n01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:58,010\nprocedures that we do put\ninto place actually work.\n\n1909\n01:44:58,010 --> 01:44:58,770\n>> Yeah.\n\n1910\n01:44:58,770 --> 01:45:00,110\nAnd the devices as well, right?\n\n1911\n01:45:00,110 --> 01:45:03,930\nSometimes you may actually think here's\na security device that we have and\n\n1912\n01:45:03,930 --> 01:45:05,540\nthe way that it functions, you're going,\n\n1913\n01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:08,270\nyou're happy with the way\nthat it functions, okay?\n\n1914\n01:45:08,270 --> 01:45:10,260\nBut let's say it actually functions.\n\n1915\n01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:14,150\nWell, in a way that's opposite, but from\nthe way that you think it's supposed to.\n\n1916\n01:45:14,150 --> 01:45:15,180\nSo, let me give you a for\n\n1917\n01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:18,100\ninstance here in terms of testing\nit in our building, right.\n\n1918\n01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:21,440\nSo, every single door lock that we have\nhere is actually electronically done.\n\n1919\n01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:22,540\nOkay.\n\n1920\n01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:24,460\nNow, in that system here,\n\n1921\n01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:26,900\nthere's two different things we\ncan do when the power goes off.\n\n1922\n01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:28,880\nOne is what we call fail open.\n\n1923\n01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:31,350\nAnd one that's called fail close.\n\n1924\n01:45:31,350 --> 01:45:36,100\nFail open means if the power goes off, the\nelectronic locks essentially don't lock.\n\n1925\n01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:38,210\nSo in other words, they'll allow\nyou to actually open it up and\n\n1926\n01:45:38,210 --> 01:45:39,250\nyou're ready to go.\n\n1927\n01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:40,850\nFail close tells you that, hey,\n\n1928\n01:45:40,850 --> 01:45:46,210\nif the power goes off,\nthat door is gonna remain locked.\n\n1929\n01:45:46,210 --> 01:45:50,820\nNow, that's usually the way that you want\nthings, unless you're still stuck in\n\n1930\n01:45:50,820 --> 01:45:56,010\nthe building when the power goes off and\nyou can't get out, and your\n\n1931\n01:45:56,010 --> 01:45:59,650\nstuff is actually another, that actually\nhappened to me before, where I was like,\n\n1932\n01:45:59,650 --> 01:46:03,490\nokay, I walked out the door, power went\noff, and then I couldn't get back in to.\n\n1933\n01:46:03,490 --> 01:46:08,790\nTo grab my care keys, I had to essentially\nwait for the power to come back on.\n\n1934\n01:46:08,790 --> 01:46:11,070\nWhen you're here on a weekend,\nit kinda really get you.\n\n1935\n01:46:11,070 --> 01:46:14,630\nAnd you're like, okay let me just wait for\nthe power to kick back on.\n\n1936\n01:46:14,630 --> 01:46:15,510\n>> That really happened?\n\n1937\n01:46:15,510 --> 01:46:16,810\n>> Yeah, it did happen.\n\n1938\n01:46:16,810 --> 01:46:18,360\nIt has happened to me before.\n\n1939\n01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:20,440\nAnd I was like, oh great,\nyou're just sitting there and\n\n1940\n01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:24,290\nyour keys are on the other side of this\nlocked door until the power kicks back on,\n\n1941\n01:46:24,290 --> 01:46:28,910\nand so yeah, so yeah you have\nto test these things out right,\n\n1942\n01:46:28,910 --> 01:46:32,900\nto make sure that they are functioning\nthe way that you need them to function,\n\n1943\n01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:37,710\nokay, so there's a lot to this, so\ndon't go all sort of-- it's easy enough,\n\n1944\n01:46:37,710 --> 01:46:40,930\nthis particular last part here\nis relatively intuitive, okay?\n\n1945\n01:46:40,930 --> 01:46:45,860\nWe are gonna get more in-depth into that\nin the series as we continue to go on here\n\n1946\n01:46:45,860 --> 01:46:49,400\nfor some of the other domain\nobjectives that we have.\n\n1947\n01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:54,090\nBut for us today though, these are the\ncontexts that you're actually gonna see\n\n1948\n01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:57,810\na lot of times when implementing\nthe idea of practices and procedures.\n\n1949\n01:46:57,810 --> 01:47:01,230\nTo back up the policies that\nwe've put in place, okay?\n\n1950\n01:47:01,230 --> 01:47:04,080\nAll right, so that essentially covers for\n\n1951\n01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:07,560\nus the objectives that we actually\nhad scheduled for what we need.\n\n1952\n01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:12,800\nNate can you think of anything else that\nwe need to essentially put on here for us?\n\n1953\n01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:13,470\n>> Yeah, so.\n\n1954\n01:47:13,470 --> 01:47:14,660\n>> Okay, excellent.\n\n1955\n01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:18,230\n>> So when you got locked out, did you\nat least have your smart phone with you?\n\n1956\n01:47:18,230 --> 01:47:19,651\n>> I did not have my smart phone.\n\n1957\n01:47:19,651 --> 01:47:20,842\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> It was on the other side of\n\n1958\n01:47:20,842 --> 01:47:21,557\nthe door with the keys.\n\n1959\n01:47:21,557 --> 01:47:23,832\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Cuz I was checking out what's going on.\n\n1960\n01:47:23,832 --> 01:47:25,446\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1961\n01:47:25,446 --> 01:47:26,815\n>> All right, it happens.\n\n1962\n01:47:26,815 --> 01:47:28,104\nWell yeah, that's all I had so\nI was wondering.\n\n1963\n01:47:28,104 --> 01:47:30,994\n>> Yeah, all right.\n\n1964\n01:47:30,994 --> 01:47:32,212\nSo that ends for us here,\n\n1965\n01:47:32,212 --> 01:47:35,406\nthis particular episode that we\nhave here on Security Contexts.\n\n1966\n01:47:35,406 --> 01:47:39,610\nAs always at IT Pro TV don't forget\nyou can watch live with us here, and\n\n1967\n01:47:39,610 --> 01:47:42,330\njump in the chat room and ask questions.\n\n1968\n01:47:42,330 --> 01:47:45,250\nWe love it when we actually have\npeople that communicate with us and\n\n1969\n01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:48,570\ninteract with us because we want our\nparticular content to really meet\n\n1970\n01:47:48,570 --> 01:47:50,530\nthe needs that are actually in there for\nus.\n\n1971\n01:47:50,530 --> 01:47:52,820\nSo please feel free to\njoin us at any time.\n\n1972\n01:47:52,820 --> 01:47:56,448\nDon't forget you also have\naccess to the website itself.\n\n1973\n01:47:56,448 --> 01:47:59,550\nAnd the Q&A forums that\nare actually

They show how to use the event viewer to access different logs in a Windows machine and discuss the ways they help identify when and possibly what security incident occurred.  Also, they discuss additional methods much as implementing IPS and/or IDS into our networks while using the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security to demonstrate andIPS.  Using a wireless access point, Cherokee shows how to setup MAC filtering and describes using 802.1x for authentication as a security mitigation technique.  Lastly, they briefly mention device hardening techniques to help.",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.840\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.350\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today\nwe're taking a look at CompTIA Security+.\n\n5\n00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.000\nWe're specifically gonna be diving into\nthe area of mitigation and deterrent\n\n6\n00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.220\ntechniques that we need to understand to\nhelp us address some security concerns.\n\n7\n00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.150\nAnd here to help us out is gonna be, well,\n\n8\n00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.110\nour CompTIA security expert, Miss\nCherokee Boose, welcome back to our show.\n\n9\n00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.660\n&gt;&gt; Thank you, Ronnie.\n\n10\n00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.340\nYeah, we're definitely gonna be\nlooking at some mitigation and\n\n11\n00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.390\ndeterrent techniques that we\ncan go ahead and implement,\n\n12\n00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.320\nand that you guys need to know for\nyour Security+ exam.\n\n13\n00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.210\nSo, first we're gonna\nstart with some logs.\n\n14\n00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.760\nYay!\n\n15\n00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.430\nWe have all sorts of logs\nwe need to take a look at.\n\n16\n00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.490\nSo, we have event logs.\n\n17\n00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.880\nAnd if you guys wanna go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n18\n00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.550\nWe'll pull up.\n\n19\n00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.944\nI have a Windows 10 machine here.\n\n20\n00:00:56.325 --> 00:01:00.425\nMicrosoft has a built-in logging\nsystem for you, a lot of different\n\n21\n00:01:00.425 --> 00:01:04.667\npieces of software will go ahead and\nhave that because logs are so important.\n\n22\n00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:08.265\nCouple of different ways you can go\nahead and access your Event Viewer here.\n\n23\n00:01:08.265 --> 00:01:11.635\nYou could go ahead and right-click\nin Windows 10 on the Start icon and\n\n24\n00:01:11.635 --> 00:01:14.330\ngo ahead and select Run.\n\n25\n00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.950\nAnd type in event viewer which I\nhave typed in here and hit OK and\n\n26\n00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.850\nit will go ahead and bring it up.\n\n27\n00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.730\nAlso alternatively you could pull it\nup through computer management so\n\n28\n00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.360\njust a couple different\nways to access that.\n\n29\n00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.990\nWhen we look at the system here we\ncan see if you go ahead and expand\n\n30\n00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.960\nout under Window logs, we have a couple\ndifferent types of logs available to us.\n\n31\n00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.040\nSo, first up on the list,\nwe've got some application logs.\n\n32\n00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.200\nNow, application logs are gonna be more\nspecific to different types of, well,\n\n33\n00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.570\napplications running on our system.\n\n34\n00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.490\nAnd they're really helpful,\nall the logs are helpful in debugging and\n\n35\n00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.910\ntroubleshooting.\n\n36\n00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.460\nAnd you take this information and\n\n37\n00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.840\ndown here at the bottom,\nyou can see there's a brief description.\n\n38\n00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.990\nAnd then we also have an event\nID in this column to the right.\n\n39\n00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.830\nWith this information, you can take that,\n\n40\n00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.690\ndo a little research online,\nthe tech community is great.\n\n41\n00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.895\nThere's all source of blogs and\nforums out there.\n\n42\n00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:15.293\nThe problem that you've encountered,\nsomeone else has probably encountered and\n\n43\n00:02:15.293 --> 00:02:18.136\nhas documented a solution\nto that situation as well.\n\n44\n00:02:18.136 --> 00:02:21.357\nNow, so let's see here we got,\nwe've got event logs and\n\n45\n00:02:21.357 --> 00:02:24.393\nnext up on the objectives\nthey talk about audit logs.\n\n46\n00:02:24.393 --> 00:02:28.987\nSo event logs are gonna be\nmore specific to events\n\n47\n00:02:28.987 --> 00:02:32.583\nwithin the operating system, okay?\n\n48\n00:02:32.583 --> 00:02:38.518\nWe see here our application logs,\nwe also have our system, okay, logs.\n\n49\n00:02:38.518 --> 00:02:41.475\nThese are gonna be specific\nto the operating system.\n\n50\n00:02:41.475 --> 00:02:44.114\nNow when we talk about audit logs,\n\n51\n00:02:44.114 --> 00:02:49.392\naudit logs are going to be logging\nany kind of event like user logins,\n\n52\n00:02:49.392 --> 00:02:53.318\nfailed login attempts,\nany kind of changes made.\n\n53\n00:02:53.318 --> 00:02:58.280\nNow, Windows actually calls their\naudit logs here security logs.\n\n54\n00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.147\nSo, it's just another way of wording it,\nall right, and\n\n55\n00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:03.558\nyou can even see that here\nit says Audit Success.\n\n56\n00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:08.277\nAnd it'll go ahead and kinda clue you in\non any kind of failed login attempts,\n\n57\n00:03:08.277 --> 00:03:10.395\nmultiple failed login attempts.\n\n58\n00:03:10.395 --> 00:03:13.680\nSo that way you could go ahead and\nimplement a mitigation or\n\n59\n00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.038\ndeterrent technique in addition to\nyour logs, such as restricting access,\n\n60\n00:03:18.038 --> 00:03:20.866\nlogin access by hours\nthrough Active Directory.\n\n61\n00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:25.320\nAnd we'll look at some other\ndifferent ways we can do that also.\n\n62\n00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.530\nAccess logs next.\n\n63\n00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.170\nAccess logs are gonna be specific\nto certain types of applications.\n\n64\n00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.400\nAnd for instance,\n\n65\n00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.630\nif you have an Apache Server running,\nyou might wanna go ahead and\n\n66\n00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.980\nlook at your access logs which have been\ngenerated any kind of resource requests.\n\n67\n00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.746\nSo that's a good way to see who's\naccessing certain systems and so forth.\n\n68\n00:03:45.746 --> 00:03:49.312\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee, I understand\nthe idea of taking a look at logs.\n\n69\n00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:53.437\nBut since we're talking about\nit in terms of Security+,\n\n70\n00:03:53.437 --> 00:03:58.234\nusually we're really focused in on\nthe idea of the audit logs a lot of\n\n71\n00:03:58.234 --> 00:04:02.865\ntimes because that normally shows\nus the ability to see whether or\n\n72\n00:04:02.865 --> 00:04:08.650\nnot Somebody has tried to access\nsuccessfully or failed to be as accessory.\n\n73\n00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.430\nAnd that way we can go and\ntrace it down as well.\n\n74\n00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.010\nSo, the other ones that you mention\nare also fairly important, but\n\n75\n00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.060\ndoes has she wants the reasons, why we\nwant to make sure, that understand looking\n\n76\n00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.800\nthe logs is one of the most\nimportant things that we tend to do.\n\n77\n00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.180\nTurkey, have you worked through some\nof the ideas -- When somebody said,\n\n78\n00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.520\nI think I've checked everything and\n\n79\n00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.980\nthe one thing they didn't check was\naccess logs or some type of log.\n\n80\n00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.870\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you really have to have\na very strict regimen here.\n\n81\n00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.860\nAnd normally, what my companies have done\nin the past, is in the IT department,\n\n82\n00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.810\nif you have Some sort of, [LAUGH] Log to\nlog who checks or maintains the logs.\n\n83\n00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.820\nYou also don't want your\nlogs accumulating so\n\n84\n00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.290\nmuch that they're utilizing your system\nresources like disk utilization,\n\n85\n00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.910\nso performing backups, Now,\nthat brings up another good point here.\n\n86\n00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.299\nIf we look at my screen again.\n\n87\n00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.260\nNIST and their special\npublication 800-92 has defined\n\n88\n00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.810\na really detailed guideline here.\n\n89\n00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.640\nGuideline to computer\nsecurity log management.\n\n90\n00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.230\nSo this is going to be a very in\ndepth guide with just suggestions.\n\n91\n00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.250\nNow scrolling down All right, they cover\na lot of different aspects here but\n\n92\n00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.920\nsomething that's pretty important\ndepending on whatever industry you are in\n\n93\n00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.920\nhere, there are different laws\nthat we need to adhere to.\n\n94\n00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.010\nI know, scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.\n\n95\n00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.350\nI know they're here somewhere.\n\n96\n00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.790\nSecurity software,\nauthentication servers, Scroll, scroll.\n\n97\n00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah the neat thing about\nthis particular publication.\n\n98\n00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.090\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n&gt;&gt; It's something that you can access by\n\n99\n00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.550\ngoing directly to the nist.gov and you're\nlooking for special publications and\n\n100\n00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.560\nnormally in terms of computer security,\n\n101\n00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.030\nit's normally anything in the 800\nseries is what you're looking for.\n\n102\n00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.320\nSo went you actually can do that,\nyou now get what the government kind of\n\n103\n00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.220\nofficially recommends, even to industries\nand organizations how they can set up\n\n104\n00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.110\neven the most basic of security to even\nsome advance security concepts and\n\n105\n00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.678\ngetting to understand\nit from there as well.\n\n106\n00:06:10.678 --> 00:06:12.755\nSo it's essentially a free resource for\n\n107\n00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:15.245\nyou to pull up and\nto be able to take a look at.\n\n108\n00:06:15.245 --> 00:06:17.505\nSo Cherokee,\nwhat are we looking at here specifically?\n\n109\n00:06:17.505 --> 00:06:21.635\n&gt;&gt; These are just some of the regulatory,\nthe laws that you may have to follow.\n\n110\n00:06:21.635 --> 00:06:22.715\nsuch as bizma.\n\n111\n00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:26.867\nWe have got our GLBA for\nour Gramm Leach and Bliley Act.\n\n112\n00:06:26.867 --> 00:06:30.523\nYou also have HIPAA,\nyou have your Sarbanes-Oxley for\n\n113\n00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:34.430\nyour financial institutions,\npayment card industries.\n\n114\n00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.430\nSo just depending on whatever\nindustry you are in,\n\n115\n00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.720\nyou need to make sure you're in compliance\nwith the log retention because certain\n\n116\n00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.240\nindustries do require you to retain\nthose logs for a certain amount of time.\n\n117\n00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.070\nSo you wanna make sure that you\nare performing due care and due diligence\n\n118\n00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.940\nby actually seeing that those logs are\nbeing maintained and retained properly.\n\n119\n00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.260\n&gt;&gt; So along with the idea of monitoring\nthese types of logs that really help us\n\n120\n00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.230\na lot of times at least to know when\nsome type of instance has happened or\n\n121\n00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.590\nwhat we were actually expecting to\nhappen where we can see trends in this\n\n122\n00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.750\nWe also tend to rely on different reports,\n\n123\n00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.790\nso Cherokee, you have reports as one\nof the things we need to talk about.\n\n124\n00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.380\nWhat are we looking for here?\n\n125\n00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so by having good documentation\nand really knowing your network.\n\n126\n00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.090\nYou network is your baby, right?\n\n127\n00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.850\nYou need to be familiar\nwith everything and\n\n128\n00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.050\nthe best way we can do this is\nby generating documentation.\n\n129\n00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.480\nBy monitoring, creating baselines, so\n\n130\n00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.810\nwe can generate reports to\nidentify any kind of anomalies or\n\n131\n00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:38.630\ndivergence which may raise a red flag and\ncause for further investigation.\n\n132\n00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.180\nSome things we want to keep an eye\non might be like our storage for\n\n133\n00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.740\nour hard disk drives, right?\n\n134\n00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.770\nWe don't want to let that\njust kind of creep up on us.\n\n135\n00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:51.670\nAnd by monitoring them on a regular basis,\nwe can foresee the need for\n\n136\n00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.180\nadditional storage.\n\n137\n00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.315\nSome other things we might wanna\nthink about would be CPU utilization.\n\n138\n00:07:57.315 --> 00:08:01.445\nPerhaps a particular application, every\ntime the application is being launched,\n\n139\n00:08:01.445 --> 00:08:03.945\nit's really hogging up a lot\nof your CPU resource So\n\n140\n00:08:03.945 --> 00:08:05.645\njust being able to identify that.\n\n141\n00:08:05.645 --> 00:08:10.725\nAnd that could also be a clue that\nsome kind of rogue software or code\n\n142\n00:08:10.725 --> 00:08:17.000\nis running on your system, any kind of\nmalware, as well as network utilization.\n\n143\n00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.518\nThat could be another indication\nof any kind of peer-to-peer sites,\n\n144\n00:08:21.518 --> 00:08:26.576\ntorrent sites, any kind of software\nlike malicious software on your network.\n\n145\n00:08:26.576 --> 00:08:29.781\nYou wanna make sure that you\nhave a good understanding so\n\n146\n00:08:29.781 --> 00:08:33.470\nthat you can identify those\nanomalies there with your reports.\n\n147\n00:08:35.362 --> 00:08:38.160\n&gt;&gt; All right, now, the other thing that\nwe also have to deal with in terms of\n\n148\n00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.360\nreporting here is fairly simple.\n\n149\n00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.200\nA lot of times what ends up happening\nis that we don't understand the idea of\n\n150\n00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:49.840\nreporting and where it has its place\nin terms of security concepts.\n\n151\n00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.860\nAnd that's because we always\nthink of security concepts as us\n\n152\n00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.420\ndefending against bad guys.\n\n153\n00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.500\nBut remember that overall\nsecurity also resides within\n\n154\n00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.483\nthe constraints here of several factors,\nright?\n\n155\n00:09:01.483 --> 00:09:05.570\nWhat we call the CIA triangle, if you\nremember that from earlier Security Plus\n\n156\n00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.130\nepisodes that we have here on ITProTV.\n\n157\n00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:13.020\nThat when you talk about confidentiality,\nintegrity, as well as availability, well,\n\n158\n00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.310\nthe idea of reports really help\nus in the realm of availability.\n\n159\n00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.960\nEspecially so that we can see when\nthings really are kind of crowding our\n\n160\n00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.140\nsystem out in terms of storage space,\nlike what Cherokee was talking about.\n\n161\n00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.000\nOr even network utilization,\n\n162\n00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.440\nwhen it's very high, it can also help us\nto actually understand things like that.\n\n163\n00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.330\nBecause it may actually indicate that\nthere is some other type of security event\n\n164\n00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.074\nthat's going on that we need\nactually think about too.\n\n165\n00:09:39.074 --> 00:09:43.246\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and what happens whenever we\nhave so many of those built-in logs,\n\n166\n00:09:43.246 --> 00:09:46.749\nWindows logs, different systems,\napplications running,\n\n167\n00:09:46.749 --> 00:09:50.000\nthey can become a little cumbersome,\noverwhelming.\n\n168\n00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.170\nSo you can actually utilize SIEM type\nof software, security information and\n\n169\n00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:59.160\nevent management software,\nto go ahead and kind of bundle that and\n\n170\n00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:05.400\npackage it all together to get\nan easier overview or at glance.\n\n171\n00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.850\nNow, when you go ahead and have a piece of\nsoftware like that, or even Windows has\n\n172\n00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:14.820\nintegrated alarms and alerts that you can\ngo ahead and set, you can set thresholds.\n\n173\n00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.650\nYou want to be careful when you're\nsetting your security thresholds.\n\n174\n00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.040\nIt might take a little\nbit of playing around and\n\n175\n00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.600\ntweaking because you don't want to\nobscure any kind of genuine attacks or\n\n176\n00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.380\nincidents by setting those\nthreshold levels too high.\n\n177\n00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.303\nSo you could set certain upper\ncontrol limits like we talked about\n\n178\n00:10:33.303 --> 00:10:35.226\nwith the hard disk drive storage, right?\n\n179\n00:10:35.226 --> 00:10:38.001\nSo we could go ahead and\nset disk quotas and\n\n180\n00:10:38.001 --> 00:10:42.530\nimplement those types of\nconfigurations to just let us know.\n\n181\n00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:47.380\nAnd we may also get those\nalerts via email, text message,\n\n182\n00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.780\na lot of different ways now.\n\n183\n00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:52.450\nBecause you want to have that\nnotification as soon as possible so\n\n184\n00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:56.510\nyou can be very reactive\nto those types of things.\n\n185\n00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.690\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt, Cherokee,\nthat this side of it,\n\n186\n00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:02.110\nwhen we talk about the monitoring logs and\nreports,\n\n187\n00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:07.880\nmost of us really do not enjoy this\nportion of trying to look at a bunch of\n\n188\n00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.750\nlistings across a screen or read reports\nthat show us things are going wrong.\n\n189\n00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.630\nIt really doesn't seem to\nbe the most exciting or\n\n190\n00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.660\nsexy side of computer security.\n\n191\n00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.960\nBut there's a lot of times that where\nwe find it actually incredibly helpful\n\n192\n00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.920\nbecause we get the most detailed\ninformation that we can.\n\n193\n00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.310\nSo we are actually talking about\nsome other things though today.\n\n194\n00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:32.639\nSo, Cherokee, we also have listed here\nwhat we need to understand, of course,\n\n195\n00:11:32.639 --> 00:11:36.490\nis the difference between\nan intrusion detection system and\n\n196\n00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.730\nan intrusion prevention system.\n\n197\n00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.082\nSo, Cherokee, help us out and\n\n198\n00:11:40.082 --> 00:11:42.478\nhelp us understand when we\nmight implement which one.\n\n199\n00:11:42.478 --> 00:11:45.426\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen and\n\n200\n00:11:45.426 --> 00:11:47.800\nwe can look at the difference here.\n\n201\n00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:53.610\nSo IDS stands for intrusion detection\nsystem versus intrusion prevention system.\n\n202\n00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:57.160\nSo if we look at detection controls\nversus prevention controls,\n\n203\n00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.670\nwe'll talk about that in a second.\n\n204\n00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.260\nWe need to kind of segregate\nthose two concepts so\n\n205\n00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.070\nwe can look at ways we're stacking.\n\n206\n00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:06.950\nSo, Ronnie, have you ever seen Shrek?\n\n207\n00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:08.290\n&gt;&gt; I have seen Shrek.\n\n208\n00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:12.710\n&gt;&gt; I love that show and one of my\nfavorite quotes that Shrek says is,\n\n209\n00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.810\nogres are like onions,\nthey have many layers.\n\n210\n00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:19.941\nAnd when we look at security from\nthe defense in depth standpoint,\n\n211\n00:12:19.941 --> 00:12:21.651\nthat's the same concept.\n\n212\n00:12:21.651 --> 00:12:22.830\nYou should have many layers.\n\n213\n00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.600\nSo when we have our deterrents and\n\n214\n00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.070\nour prevention, okay, those are two\nthings that we can go ahead and stack.\n\n215\n00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:33.930\nNow just so you're aware of\nthe different acronyms that you may see.\n\n216\n00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.070\nWe have IDS for\nintrusion detection system.\n\n217\n00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.460\nWe have IPS for\nintrusion prevention system.\n\n218\n00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:45.829\nYou also have the ability to use these\nconcepts on network-based level,\n\n219\n00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:49.660\nor you can also use them\non a host-based level.\n\n220\n00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:54.200\nSo what we're looking at here is,\nlet's just say this device,\n\n221\n00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.980\nokay, can be either intrusion detection or\nprevention system.\n\n222\n00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:02.330\nThe current logical network\nplacement is on the perimeter, so\n\n223\n00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.968\nwe would want to go ahead and use this\nas more of a preventative mechanism.\n\n224\n00:13:05.968 --> 00:13:11.280\nIf we moved the actual location to,\nlet's say,\n\n225\n00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:16.210\nto protect this SQL server that we have\nhere, it would be more of an intrusion\n\n226\n00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:20.730\ndetection system to go ahead and\nthrow up that alarm, raise that red flag.\n\n227\n00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:25.095\nSo a lot of pieces of\nsoftware that are out on\n\n228\n00:13:25.095 --> 00:13:29.839\nthe market now really\nare full encompassing.\n\n229\n00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:30.509\nRight?\n\n230\n00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:34.703\nSo we still do need to delineate\nthe difference between detection and\n\n231\n00:13:34.703 --> 00:13:38.440\nprevention systems for\nthe objectives on your exam.\n\n232\n00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:43.878\nBut in real life, you may see most\nsystems want to be more real-time.\n\n233\n00:13:43.878 --> 00:13:46.660\nThat's what they're striving for because\nthat's what businesses are wanting.\n\n234\n00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.280\nSo.\n&gt;&gt; All right so, Cherokee,\n\n235\n00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.370\nhelp us out here.\n\n236\n00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:55.230\nWhen we talk about intrusion detection,\nwhat is it that the device does or\n\n237\n00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.675\ndoesn't do that the other one may or\nmay not do?\n\n238\n00:13:58.675 --> 00:14:00.430\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n239\n00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:04.807\nSo, detection is going to be more\nof a passive technique, okay?\n\n240\n00:14:04.807 --> 00:14:08.345\nAnd it'll go ahead and\nsend you that alert, that alarm,\n\n241\n00:14:08.345 --> 00:14:13.295\nbut it's not gonna take any additional\nmeasures to stop or thwart that attack.\n\n242\n00:14:13.295 --> 00:14:17.814\nNow an IPS prevention,\nokay, is gonna go ahead and\n\n243\n00:14:17.814 --> 00:14:23.860\ndo something to go ahead and\ntry to mitigate or stop that attack.\n\n244\n00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:30.300\nSo for instance, if your system\ndetects some kind of malicious code or\n\n245\n00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:34.560\nany kind of header manipulation\ncoming from a particular IP address,\n\n246\n00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.810\nit could go ahead and temporarily\nchange your firewall configurations.\n\n247\n00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.170\nPerhaps to block incoming\ncommunications from that IP address,\n\n248\n00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:43.810\nwhich is called IP shunning.\n\n249\n00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:48.260\nSo really if it detects any kind\nof enumeration for port scanning,\n\n250\n00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.170\nit might be able to go ahead and\nblock those types of ports and\n\n251\n00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.700\nshut them down,\ndifferent types of things like that.\n\n252\n00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:58.490\nSo it's actually taking a reactive measure\nto prevent that attack from occurring.\n\n253\n00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, whenever I think about\nthe difference between them,\n\n254\n00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.470\nI normally take a look at the IPS\nas preventing the attack.\n\n255\n00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:08.190\nIn other words, you probably wouldn't get\nsome type of log like on that SQL Server\n\n256\n00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:09.950\nthat an attack has gone on.\n\n257\n00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:13.990\nOr even in that intrusion prevention\nsystem that just tells you, hey something\n\n258\n00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:17.438\nmade it here, but it's actually stopping,\nand it tells you exactly what's going on.\n\n259\n00:15:17.438 --> 00:15:19.780\nOkay?\nIn an intrusion detection system,\n\n260\n00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.500\nit logs that an attack has happened.\n\n261\n00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.770\nAnd normally when you have\nsomething like that, the thing is,\n\n262\n00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.700\nit doesn't actually prevent\nanything from happening.\n\n263\n00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.510\nNow both of them end up generating a log.\n\n264\n00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:34.050\nAnd they can actually even email you that,\nhey something's going on.\n\n265\n00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:37.170\nBut now what you have in place though,\nokay,\n\n266\n00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:40.750\nis you have one system that says I'll\ntell you when something's happening.\n\n267\n00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:44.230\nAnd then you have another one that says\nI'm stopping what's happening as well.\n\n268\n00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:47.570\nAnd there's been recent commercials,\nat least here in the United States,\n\n269\n00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:50.980\nthat tried to emphasize there's\na difference between credit monitoring and\n\n270\n00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:51.970\ncredit protection.\n\n271\n00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.938\nAnd they've been pretty funny, add them.\n\n272\n00:15:53.938 --> 00:15:57.362\nSo one of them is a bank robber\nthat goes and runs in the bank and\n\n273\n00:15:57.362 --> 00:15:59.121\nsays, I'm robbing the bank.\n\n274\n00:15:59.121 --> 00:16:00.813\nAnd it's a security guard\nthat's standing there.\n\n275\n00:16:00.813 --> 00:16:04.340\nAnd one person looks up and goes,\nwhy aren't you doing anything?\n\n276\n00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.960\nI'm just a monitor.\n\n277\n00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.110\nI'm just a security monitor.\n\n278\n00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.030\nI don't do anything.\n\n279\n00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.035\nI just let you know that\nyou're being robbed.\n\n280\n00:16:13.035 --> 00:16:14.090\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And he just looks on and\n\n281\n00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:15.375\ngoes, you're being robbed.\n\n282\n00:16:15.375 --> 00:16:18.500\n[LAUGH] And so\nhe's trying to make that emphasis.\n\n283\n00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.510\nAnd intrusion detection and\n\n284\n00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.670\nintrusion prevention,\nthat's that we're also doing here.\n\n285\n00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.200\nAnd you might be wondering what.\n\n286\n00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:29.250\nWell, isn't it always better then to\nimplement an intrusion preventive system?\n\n287\n00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:34.120\nAbsolutely, in all reality, it is always\nbetter that something like that happens.\n\n288\n00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.430\nBut, there's also a case, though,\ndepending on what type of\n\n289\n00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:41.330\nindustry that you're in, that regulations\nsuch as what Cherokee showed us and\n\n290\n00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:45.890\nsome other things though may also indicate\nto you that you have to do an intrusion\n\n291\n00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:50.660\ndetection system, so that they can log\nwhen a breach actually occurred, and\n\n292\n00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:54.390\nwhen a crime actually\nhas occurred as well.\n\n293\n00:16:54.390 --> 00:17:00.280\nYou can't really go ahead and prosecute\nanybody based on an attempt to rob you.\n\n294\n00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.020\nYou actually have to prove that\nthey robbed you a lot of times\n\n295\n00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.650\nbefore that can actually happen.\n\n296\n00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.150\nSo, some industries requires\nsomething like that, too.\n\n297\n00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.910\nThe other reason why you might chosen\nintrusion detection system above\n\n298\n00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:15.721\nthe intrusion prevention is if you have\nsome type of performance degredation\n\n299\n00:17:15.721 --> 00:17:20.200\nwhen you actually have an intrusion\nproven system in line, okay.\n\n300\n00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.180\nSo it could be where you're\ntrying to actually say I want\n\n301\n00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.960\neverybody to have access\ntoall of my devices.\n\n302\n00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.960\nBut the very fact is it slows down with\nthe intrusion prevention system so\n\n303\n00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:34.650\nmuch that your end users are having\na tough experience in using your system.\n\n304\n00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:38.380\nAnd so you may go to an intrusion\ndetection system instead.\n\n305\n00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.910\nSo that goes through that idea\nof that constraint triangle.\n\n306\n00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:46.140\nTo make sure that everything also\nhappens as well, due to availability.\n\n307\n00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:50.180\nIf you can't make your resources available\nto who they need to, well that means your\n\n308\n00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:54.270\nparticular security may be a little bit\ntoo strong for what's needed here, too.\n\n309\n00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:58.290\nSo, don't always bypass one for the other\njust because you think one's cooler\n\n310\n00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:02.020\nthan the other, always make sure you\nsee it in context of what you need.\n\n311\n00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:05.250\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and like Ronnie said,\nyou gotta look at that triad, right?\n\n312\n00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.250\nAnd see what you're really focusing on,\n\n313\n00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:09.580\nwhat is more important\nto your organization?\n\n314\n00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:13.980\nSpeed and efficiency versus security,\nor are you gonna go ahead and\n\n315\n00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:18.760\nforfeit some of that speed so that you can\nhave that additional security, because if\n\n316\n00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:22.400\nwe see this diagram here, think about it,\nwe're still behind our firewall, right?\n\n317\n00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.300\nSo we're still building up our layers.\n\n318\n00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.788\nWe still have our host-based firewall.\n\n319\n00:18:25.788 --> 00:18:26.880\nWith the SQL Server,\n\n320\n00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.570\nwe might even be using something\nspecific like an application firewall.\n\n321\n00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.990\nWe might have those types of\nthings implemented to go ahead and\n\n322\n00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.910\nbuild those onion layers there for us.\n\n323\n00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:38.190\nSo definitely.\n\n324\n00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.860\nAnother thing that we can look\nat here since my screen is\n\n325\n00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.360\nup is something called 802.1x.\n\n326\n00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:49.390\nThis is going to our port-based\nauthentication security.\n\n327\n00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:54.440\nNow a little more secure here when we're\ntalking about a switched environment,\n\n328\n00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.670\nokay, so.\n\n329\n00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:59.770\nWhat we're looking at,\nwe have a supplicant, okay?\n\n330\n00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:03.660\nSomeone who wants to go ahead and\nplug into our network to gain access.\n\n331\n00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.440\nSo, we actually have our switch acting as,\nkind of like a middle man,\n\n332\n00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:11.050\nlike a bouncer, and our switch,\nthis is gonna be called our authenticator.\n\n333\n00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:16.250\nSo, our authenticator will then enable\nEAP over our local area network.\n\n334\n00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:21.350\nAnd pass off that responsibility to\ngo ahead and authenticate, with here,\n\n335\n00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:25.610\nlet me scroll down, we have,\nyou guys can see that, a radius server.\n\n336\n00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.230\nSo this is our AAA server for,\n\n337\n00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:32.500\nhere we have our authentication,\nauthorization, and accounting.\n\n338\n00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.443\nI didn't want to miss anyone there.\n\n339\n00:19:33.443 --> 00:19:34.147\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n340\n00:19:34.147 --> 00:19:37.609\nyeah we have different types of AAA\nservers that you could implement with\n\n341\n00:19:37.609 --> 00:19:40.290\nthe radius probably being one\nof the most common there.\n\n342\n00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:46.630\nSo, that's a very secure way to go ahead\nand implement that port-based security.\n\n343\n00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.120\nSo you might need to go ahead and\nset it up a little bit more,\n\n344\n00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:53.230\nand make sure you can utilize port\nmirroring and things like that.\n\n345\n00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:58.140\nBut from a security perspective, these are\nways that we can control our networks and\n\n346\n00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.570\nwho has access, okay,\nnetwork access control.\n\n347\n00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:05.958\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so let's think about this idea in\nterms of the way that we normally provide\n\n348\n00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:08.800\ngeneral access through our\nwireless a lot of times.\n\n349\n00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:13.630\nAnd that's normally where we tend to\nuse the 802.1x type of authentication.\n\n350\n00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:14.940\nSo it's fairly simple.\n\n351\n00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.090\nYou go and you go hey.\n\n352\n00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:19.030\nI want to use your guest network and\nsomebody provides you with a password.\n\n353\n00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.353\nThat's means everybody that is there,\nright?\n\n354\n00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:23.938\nWill have essentially\nthe same exact password and\n\n355\n00:20:23.938 --> 00:20:25.606\nthen they'll be able to get in.\n\n356\n00:20:25.606 --> 00:20:30.366\nSo that means that person can actually go\nand tell somebody eating at McDonald's or\n\n357\n00:20:30.366 --> 00:20:31.310\nStarbucks.\n\n358\n00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.834\nGo hey, if you go over to ITProTV,\nhere's the password to their wireless.\n\n359\n00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:37.636\nYou can go over there and\nuse their wireless, too.\n\n360\n00:20:37.636 --> 00:20:40.246\nThat's actually something\nwe don't want to happen.\n\n361\n00:20:40.246 --> 00:20:45.486\n802.1x prevents that by offloading\nthe authentication authorization and\n\n362\n00:20:45.486 --> 00:20:50.415\naccounting to another device where it's\nnot set on the access point that's\n\n363\n00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:53.200\ncoming in but\nnow that means we can do what?\n\n364\n00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.180\nWe can granularly control this.\n\n365\n00:20:55.180 --> 00:21:00.960\nI can create an account inside\nof my own network accounting or\n\n366\n00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.242\nauthentication server.\n\n367\n00:21:02.242 --> 00:21:06.040\nThat says Cherokee can get in as\nlong as it's actually Cherokee.\n\n368\n00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.200\nAnd what it does is it puts something\nonto her particular laptop.\n\n369\n00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:12.690\nI was trying to remember\nwhat it's called here.\n\n370\n00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:14.110\nIt's usually a certificate.\n\n371\n00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:18.160\nAnd then from that point, as long as she\nhas that certificate, it just lets her in.\n\n372\n00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.580\nWe're tied to that particular\nmanner of allowing her to get in.\n\n373\n00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.313\nIt's not really necessarily\ntied to just the laptop, but\n\n374\n00:21:24.313 --> 00:21:28.790\nit's really tied to the fact that it's\nactually Cherokee's laptop, is what it is.\n\n375\n00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:32.980\nSo, it allows us to do that based\non the idea of using certificates.\n\n376\n00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:37.050\nMuch more secure because it means that\nregardless of what devices are brought\n\n377\n00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:41.350\non my network, it doesn't matter if\nI give somebody a password or not.\n\n378\n00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:44.266\nIf they don't have an account in\nmy network, they can't get in.\n\n379\n00:21:44.266 --> 00:21:45.748\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; Very much a stronger security measure-\n\n380\n00:21:45.748 --> 00:21:46.461\n&gt;&gt; We're trying to keep those\n\n381\n00:21:46.461 --> 00:21:47.940\nrogue machines off the network,\nright, Ronnie?\n\n382\n00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.510\n&gt;&gt; Very much a deterrent at this point.\n\n383\n00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:50.250\nYup.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\n\n384\n00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:55.230\nso you can also run different types\nof monitoring utilities at the very.\n\n385\n00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:58.410\nThe most basic would be some kind of free\nutility that you could even put on your\n\n386\n00:21:58.410 --> 00:21:59.960\nsmartphone, like.\n\n387\n00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:06.070\nAnd it's not gonna be very in depth, but\nit's still a tool that you can utilize.\n\n388\n00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:10.700\nUsing something like a sniffer to go ahead\nand monitor for those different devices,\n\n389\n00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.810\nlike Wireshark, would definitely be.\n\n390\n00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:14.210\nThere's so\nmany different options out there.\n\n391\n00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:15.670\nSo you just wanna look at that further.\n\n392\n00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:18.250\nAny kind of rogue machine detection.\n\n393\n00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:23.231\nAnother think I wanna show you guys here,\nwell like Ronnie was talking about,\n\n394\n00:22:23.231 --> 00:22:25.495\nso in addition to our wired access,\n\n395\n00:22:25.495 --> 00:22:30.040\nwe can also set different types\nof wireless restrictions as well.\n\n396\n00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.467\nSo I'm just gonna go ahead.\n\n397\n00:22:31.467 --> 00:22:36.056\nAnd we have a little wireless access point\nhere we're gonna go ahead and log into.\n\n398\n00:22:36.056 --> 00:22:38.420\nThe IP address, 192.168.\n\n399\n00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:42.420\nAnd that's gonna be .1.1 for\nthis device here.\n\n400\n00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:43.460\nI just have the defaults here.\n\n401\n00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.350\nWe're not working with\nanything too secure.\n\n402\n00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:46.760\nSo we'll go ahead and log in.\n\n403\n00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.940\nAnd you guys at home, even if you don't\nhave, we're talking at home, business.\n\n404\n00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.640\nIt's going to be a little bit different.\n\n405\n00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.520\nThis is just a home all in one\ndevice that we're logging into here.\n\n406\n00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.510\nIt's a Cisco E2000 series so.\n\n407\n00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.640\nThat's what we're looking at right now.\n\n408\n00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:06.230\nLet's see we've got access restriction,\na security tab here.\n\n409\n00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:10.690\nIf you've never gone through your device,\nI highly recommend you do that at home.\n\n410\n00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:12.420\nTo just go ahead and secure your systems.\n\n411\n00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:16.050\nIf you're in Security+, hopefully\nyou've taken a look at that before\n\n412\n00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:17.160\n&gt;&gt; We're not gonna go through\n\n413\n00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.060\neverything that you can do to\nharden your access point here, but\n\n414\n00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:23.900\nwhat i do wanna show you,\nlet's see where is that.\n\n415\n00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:28.140\nWe have different types of\ninternet access policy.\n\n416\n00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.870\nYou can set different\ntypes of restrictions,\n\n417\n00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:32.270\nmight be a little bit\ndifferent per device, but\n\n418\n00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:34.680\nlooking at this device you can go ahead.\n\n419\n00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.400\nAnd create,\n\n420\n00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.410\ngenerate a list, and attach different\npolicies to certain MAC addresses.\n\n421\n00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:44.140\nSo you could go ahead and MAC limit,\nor filter based upon that MAC address.\n\n422\n00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:47.430\nSo if we go ahead and\njust create a MAC address here,\n\n423\n00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:50.993\nwe're just gonna use,\nsomething silly, 1,1.\n\n424\n00:23:50.993 --> 00:23:53.220\nAnd we'll go 2,2.\n\n425\n00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.042\n3,3.\n\n426\n00:23:55.042 --> 00:23:58.083\nNow remember this isn't the most\nfoolproof method, right?\n\n427\n00:23:58.083 --> 00:23:59.525\nBecause why?\n\n428\n00:23:59.525 --> 00:24:01.757\nWell, spoofing right?\n\n429\n00:24:01.757 --> 00:24:05.804\nAnd in this particular device you also\nhave the option to set any kind of\n\n430\n00:24:05.804 --> 00:24:09.970\nfiltering based on IP addresses as\nwell but again it's not a hundred.\n\n431\n00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:11.900\nWhoops, it's not a hundred percent.\n\n432\n00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.950\nSo let's see, are they let me do this.\n\n433\n00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:21.260\nThe second character,\nlet's see, do I have it?\n\n434\n00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.058\nSorry about that,\nwanna go ahead and try it again.\n\n435\n00:24:24.058 --> 00:24:27.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I put my numbers first, sorry guys.\n\n436\n00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:31.270\n&gt;&gt; So remember as you're doing something\nlike this, the goal behind this is simple.\n\n437\n00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:35.760\nBy using the mac address filtering,\nyou're actually saying the list of devices\n\n438\n00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:40.590\nthat have mac addresses that can\nconnect into your network okay.\n\n439\n00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:45.890\nAnd allows us then to really filter out\njust any random device from coming in.\n\n440\n00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:50.610\nNow, it in itself is not full proof\njust like what Cherry Key was saying.\n\n441\n00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:55.070\nBecause of the very fact that you do have\nthe devices out there that allows you to\n\n442\n00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:59.830\nessentially spoof the mac address\nof whatever device it is, and\n\n443\n00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:02.390\nthese mac addresses are what's\nbeing sent over wireless.\n\n444\n00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:07.220\nThat means, you can also do that too and\nfind that information out.\n\n445\n00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.880\nSo, this is not a foolproof\nsecurity measure.\n\n446\n00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:15.010\nBut, it is going to at least limit\nthose that don't have the ability\n\n447\n00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:17.350\nto find out the information to spoof.\n\n448\n00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.060\nAt least the majority of the time here.\n\n449\n00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:25.510\nExactly, and so we can go ahead and\nset these limitations based upon hours.\n\n450\n00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:29.160\nLet's say you have kids and they have a 9\nPM bedtime, so you could go ahead and\n\n451\n00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.510\nset that individually for\nmachines based upon their mac address.\n\n452\n00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:37.960\nSo you guys can still surf after 9 PM,\nbut your kids are limited there.\n\n453\n00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:42.790\nYou can also go ahead and\nset blocks certain types of ports.\n\n454\n00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.680\nNow, like I said before,\n\n455\n00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.970\nyou definitely wanna see what features\nyour access point already has.\n\n456\n00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:55.000\nWe don't want WPS running, we know that we\ndon't wanna run Universal Plugin Play for\n\n457\n00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.670\nnot using some kind of gaming console.\n\n458\n00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:58.810\nSo this is that concept of hardening.\n\n459\n00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:00.770\nOkay we're hardening our device here.\n\n460\n00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:04.970\nSo, we can go ahead and again using\nour defensing depth at this level,\n\n461\n00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:08.060\ngo ahead and block it, but\nalso we can configure our host\n\n462\n00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:11.460\nbased fire wall to go ahead and\nwork together on it so.\n\n463\n00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.570\nYeah, that's about it for\n\n464\n00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:19.710\nthis hear, let's go ahead and\nactually pull up.\n\n465\n00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.840\nMy virtual machine,\nwhere'd it go, here we go.\n\n466\n00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.640\n&gt;&gt; All right Cherokee,\n\n467\n00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.800\nso what are we taking a look at\nnow as you're pulling this up?\n\n468\n00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:35.200\n&gt;&gt; So we're going to go ahead, and let me\njust close out of my event viewer here.\n\n469\n00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.040\nWe'll just pull up our Windows firewall,\n\n470\n00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:41.260\nand we'll go to our\nadvanced settings here.\n\n471\n00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.110\nAnd this is just something\nthat's integrated into,\n\n472\n00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.480\nthis is all Windows 10 client here.\n\n473\n00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:52.740\nAnd go to Advance settings so,\nthey have our prebuilt inbound and\n\n474\n00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:56.950\noutbound rules, remember if you wanna to\ncompletely prohibit any type of traffic\n\n475\n00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:00.370\non a particular port, you need to go ahead\nand set both those rules, inbound and\n\n476\n00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:07.460\noutbound so they have a slew of\ndifferent rules that are already set.\n\n477\n00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.980\nYou can look at your different tuples\nhere, the columns that show you\n\n478\n00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:14.520\nthe different parameters,\nassociated with that individual rule.\n\n479\n00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.580\nIf it's enabled or not, so you could just\ngo ahead and right click on that, and\n\n480\n00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:19.680\nconfigure if you needed to.\n\n481\n00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.100\nYou can also create.\n\n482\n00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.460\n&gt;&gt; What did you call it?\n\n483\n00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:23.540\nA tuple?\n&gt;&gt; Tuples.\n\n484\n00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:24.040\n&gt;&gt; Tuple?\n\n485\n00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.490\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what they're called.\n\n486\n00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:26.540\nIs that official?\n\n487\n00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:27.320\n&gt;&gt; That's official.\n\n488\n00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:28.030\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nSee?\n\n489\n00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:28.665\nI did not know that.\n\n490\n00:27:28.665 --> 00:27:30.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, excellent.\n\n491\n00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:32.580\nAnd so that's actually saying\nthat there's a pairing, what?\n\n492\n00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:36.200\nInbound and outbound rules, right?\n\n493\n00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.790\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well the tuples, technically,\n\n494\n00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:42.079\nare going to be the vertical columns,\nthose are tuples.\n\n495\n00:27:42.079 --> 00:27:45.829\n[CROSSTALK] So,\nwe can check our inbound our outbound,\n\n496\n00:27:45.829 --> 00:27:50.572\ndoing all these configuration\nstudying that's what hardening is.\n\n497\n00:27:50.572 --> 00:27:55.096\nAnd things like removing the graphical\nuser interface of our devices\n\n498\n00:27:55.096 --> 00:27:56.969\nif we have a Hyper-V set up.\n\n499\n00:27:56.969 --> 00:28:01.460\nThe actual default installation for\nServer 2012 R2 for Hyper-V.\n\n500\n00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.040\nYou can go ahead and\n\n501\n00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:06.490\ndownload that of their site and\nwe don't have it by GUI, right.\n\n502\n00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:09.330\nAnd we do that to go ahead and\nreduce our surface attack area.\n\n503\n00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:11.030\nAnd that's the concept of hardening.\n\n504\n00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:14.665\nJust wanna make sure I'm not\nforgetting anything here.\n\n505\n00:28:14.665 --> 00:28:18.895\nWe've got disable, and you can unnecessary\nservices that may be running, like for\n\n506\n00:28:18.895 --> 00:28:21.575\nnot utilizing that bios,\nwhich I hope you are not.\n\n507\n00:28:21.575 --> 00:28:24.485\nSo you can also additionally\nblock the associated net\n\n508\n00:28:24.485 --> 00:28:29.085\nbios ports if you wanted to go ahead and\nreally secure your system there.\n\n509\n00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:32.730\nLocal machines you can go ahead and\n\n510\n00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:36.430\nimplement local policy to set\nthose local security policies.\n\n511\n00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:40.310\nIf you're working in a domain environment\nrunning Active Directory group policy is\n\n512\n00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:43.917\ngoing to be the way to go there to go\nahead and push those policies out.\n\n513\n00:28:43.917 --> 00:28:44.960\nWhat else?\n\n514\n00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.011\nRemediation.\n\n515\n00:28:47.011 --> 00:28:52.459\nLet's take a look back at this diagram\nthat'll be a good way to show you guys.\n\n516\n00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.720\nOops, I can find it.\n\n517\n00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.330\nNow notice on this particular\ndiagram I have a remediation or\n\n518\n00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:03.620\ncaptive portal and it might just\nbe a type of open authentication.\n\n519\n00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.650\nThe reason we might have a system\nlike this is if one of our\n\n520\n00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:12.570\ndevices does not adhere to our\nhealth policy with our networks, so\n\n521\n00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:18.180\nthe term Security Posture if you think\nabout posture the way you stand right.\n\n522\n00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:21.720\nIs basically the way\nyour company the stands\n\n523\n00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.580\nthat your company has on security so.\n\n524\n00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:28.240\nAll kind of mitigation techniques,\nrisk management,\n\n525\n00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:32.400\nall things comprehensive security,\nthat's your company's security posture.\n\n526\n00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.590\nSo that's what that term means.\n\n527\n00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:37.820\nContinuous monitoring,\nthis is not something you do\n\n528\n00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:41.030\njust during the on-boarding phase,\nit's something you want to keep up for\n\n529\n00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:44.530\nthese devices,\nespecially with our BYOD devices.\n\n530\n00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:49.900\nAnd if your devices fall outside\nthe realm of your health policies or\n\n531\n00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:54.680\nyour network access policy server here\nindicates that a system doesn't have\n\n532\n00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:58.060\nany kind of anti-malware or\nit doesn't have patches.\n\n533\n00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:02.250\nIt will go ahead and move those\ndevices off your production network.\n\n534\n00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:08.320\nInto this captive portal of remediation,\nthe MZ here to go ahead and\n\n535\n00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:12.900\nnotify that individual to bring\nthat unit back into compliance.\n\n536\n00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:17.840\nA couple of other things we wanna do is\nalso to implement password protection.\n\n537\n00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.100\nAlways lock your systems when you're\nwalking away to prevent any kind of\n\n538\n00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.760\nlunchtime attacks, things like that.\n\n539\n00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.730\nDisable any unnecessary accounts.\n\n540\n00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:30.980\nLook, we know there are guest accounts,\nadministrative accounts that we're not\n\n541\n00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.180\ngonna be using,\ncertain types of accounts on our systems.\n\n542\n00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.450\nWe know about it so\nattackers know about it.\n\n543\n00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:37.350\nYou might want to go ahead and\n\n544\n00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:40.900\nrename them or disable them completely\nif you don't plan on using them.\n\n545\n00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:44.700\nJust checking to see if I'm\nforgetting anything here.\n\n546\n00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.430\nAlso, protect your management interfaces,\nright?\n\n547\n00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.090\nSo any kind of management consoles.\n\n548\n00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:52.590\nLike a few moments ago when I\nlogged into that router, and\n\n549\n00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:55.300\nI just had the default admin user name and\npassword.\n\n550\n00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.770\nThat's something we never want to do.\n\n551\n00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:59.640\nThat's the first thing we want to change,\nand you know what?\n\n552\n00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:04.710\nI might even disable any kind of\nremote connectivity for those devices.\n\n553\n00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:08.260\nIf I'm working in a very\nsecure system industry.\n\n554\n00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:12.690\nI might just say look you have to go ahead\nand use console port and manage that\n\n555\n00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:18.340\ndevice in a physical sense, so to kind\nof remove any additional risks there.\n\n556\n00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.735\nI think that's about it.\n\n557\n00:31:21.735 --> 00:31:24.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you Cherokee for\n\n558\n00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:27.900\nintroducing us at least to these\nconcepts that will help us\n\n559\n00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:31.480\nunderstand some of the deterrents and\nsome of the things we can do to\n\n560\n00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.730\nhelp mitigate some security\nissues that we'll end up facing.\n\n561\n00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.905\nRemember we've taken a look\nat the idea of using logs.\n\n562\n00:31:37.905 --> 00:31:39.530\nWe've also talked about\nusing network security.\n\n563\n00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.410\nWe talked about some different reporting.\n\n564\n00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:45.310\nWe've even talked about some\nimplementation of devices like ID's and\n\n565\n00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:47.530\nIP's to help us out as well.\n\n566\n00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:52.340\nAnd then of course, the general generic\nissues of device hardening, and\n\n567\n00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:55.650\neven some implementations\nof stronger authentication.\n\n568\n00:31:55.650 --> 00:32:00.580\nAll those are rushy issues that we as\nsecurity professionals, heading towards\n\n569\n00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:05.620\ngiving our security plus, we're gonna\nbe needing to be familiar with and\n\n570\n00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.330\nat least have a basic\nconcept with those things.\n\n571\n00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:10.980\nIn implementation you'll see everybody\nimplements them a little bit\n\n572\n00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:11.620\ndifferently

          "description": "In this episode, Ronnie and Cherokee take a look at the various attacks.  They briefly describe several attack methods such as DoS and DDos that are designed not as an attack breaching the systems target but a way to deny access to resources targeted.  They also describe the nature of man in the middle attacks and the use of replay attacks.  Cherokee describes the MiTM as the method used to get data and the Replay attack as taking data learned during the MiTMand using it.  Also addressed by the team, are spoofing and some of the different types of Phishing attacks and SPAM.",

00:00:12.520\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.690\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great episode,\n\n5\n00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.760\nright here at ITProTV,\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n6\n00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.780\nAnd today, we're gonna actually take a\nlook into the world of CompTIA Security+.\n\n7\n00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.840\nWe're specifically going to be\naddressing some of the different types\n\n8\n00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.400\nof attacks that we normally see.\n\n9\n00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.990\nAnd we need to be able\nto summarize them and\n\n10\n00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.390\nhere to help us out is going\nto be Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.040\nCherokee, welcome to our studios again.\n\n12\n00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.390\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.080\nYeah, it's so common that we have these\nattacks because, well, let's face it,\n\n14\n00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.160\npeople can get away with them.\n\n15\n00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.540\nSo it's not like we're gonna be\nseeing that slow down any time soon.\n\n16\n00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.300\nSo let's definitely make sure\nwe understand the different\n\n17\n00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.790\ntypes of attacks that are out there,\nso we can better prepare ourselves.\n\n18\n00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.350\nSo recently, Ronnie, I don't know if you\nrecall on a Friday afternoon, there was\n\n19\n00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.380\na major attack that brought down\na large portion of North America.\n\n20\n00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.250\nDo you recall that?.\n\n21\n00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.040\n&gt;&gt; I do remember a little bit of that.\n\n22\n00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.560\nIt's not the freshest thing\nin my mind right now.\n\n23\n00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.982\nBut yes, I do remember we had even had\nproblems right here in the studio with\n\n24\n00:01:10.982 --> 00:01:11.510\nmy recording.\n\n25\n00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.230\nYeah, and it kind of came in waves.\n\n26\n00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.300\nIt was on a Friday, it was actually\nOctober 21st here of 2016, and\n\n27\n00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.280\nwe saw three main waves of attacks.\n\n28\n00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.970\nAnd it was a type of distributed\ndenial of service attack.\n\n29\n00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.780\nSo for our CompTIA exam,\n\n30\n00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.560\nthat's one of the main terms that\nthey want us to be familiar with.\n\n31\n00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.450\nAnd it was so effective.\n\n32\n00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.950\nIt brought down the majority\nof the east coast and\n\n33\n00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.030\njust scattered all\nthroughout North America.\n\n34\n00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.770\nAnd I'm sure you've heard of this term,\nthe IoT, Internet of Things, right?\n\n35\n00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.360\nLike all of our automated\nhome appliances and devices.\n\n36\n00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.410\nSo recently the source code was released\nfor a lot of these IoT devices and\n\n37\n00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.430\nwe saw a huge uptick in\nthe amount of IoT attacks occur.\n\n38\n00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.050\nLiterally it went from like 200,000\nsomething to 400,000 of reported.\n\n39\n00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.840\nSo it's crazy in the amount,\ndoubling there.\n\n40\n00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.640\nSo I can only assume that\nthis is just the beginning.\n\n41\n00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.010\nWe've kind of like opened up Pandora's box\nand we're gonna see a lot more of these.\n\n42\n00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.420\nSo let's talk about what\ndistributed denial of service is.\n\n43\n00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.770\nFirst of all, what denial of service is.\n\n44\n00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.520\nSo if you go ahead and\nsee that term D-O-S, denial of service.\n\n45\n00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.080\nWell, a lot of people just kinda get\na little boxed-in when they think about\n\n46\n00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.310\ndenial of a service attacks.\n\n47\n00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.410\nBut I want you guys to just really open\nyour minds because it really means\n\n48\n00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.490\nany time a particular network\nresource is unavailable.\n\n49\n00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.710\nThat's denial of service.\n\n50\n00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.819\nYou can have physical denial of service,\n\n51\n00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.236\nyou can have technological\ndenial of service.\n\n52\n00:02:43.236 --> 00:02:45.118\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen.\n\n53\n00:02:45.118 --> 00:02:49.584\nAnd I'll show you a couple of different\nexamples of how we can actually use this\n\n54\n00:02:49.584 --> 00:02:50.640\nin theory here.\n\n55\n00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.015\nSo here we have an attacker's PC.\n\n56\n00:02:54.015 --> 00:02:56.355\nAnd we have an unsuspecting middle man.\n\n57\n00:02:56.355 --> 00:02:58.385\nAnd then we have Ronnie's PC.\n\n58\n00:02:58.385 --> 00:03:02.145\nNow, Ronnie likes to go online and\nsurf and go to certain websites.\n\n59\n00:03:02.145 --> 00:03:04.165\nI don't know,\nmaybe he plays a lot of games.\n\n60\n00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:05.625\nAnd I don't know, Ronnie.\n\n61\n00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:08.875\nSo you might have picked something up\nalong the way, a piece of malware,\n\n62\n00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:11.355\nthat was just kind of laying\ndormant on your system,\n\n63\n00:03:11.355 --> 00:03:14.670\nmaybe a type of logic bomb\nthat we could use here.\n\n64\n00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.150\nAnd not a whole lot that Ronnie notices,\nnot a lot of pop-ups or\n\n65\n00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.950\nany kind of obvious symptoms.\n\n66\n00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.290\nBut maybe his systems' just\nrunning a little sluggish or slow.\n\n67\n00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.185\nAnd it's not until a particular\ntrigger date or event or\n\n68\n00:03:28.185 --> 00:03:32.165\nwhatever that this attacker\ncould even launch that and\n\n69\n00:03:32.165 --> 00:03:34.855\nuse Ronnie in what we call\nthese terms a zombie.\n\n70\n00:03:34.855 --> 00:03:36.557\nRonnie would be the zombie.\n\n71\n00:03:36.557 --> 00:03:37.565\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Um-hm.\n\n72\n00:03:37.565 --> 00:03:38.405\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n73\n00:03:38.405 --> 00:03:39.960\n&gt;&gt; Typically.\n&gt;&gt; The drone, right.\n\n74\n00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.690\nAnd if you gather enough systems, you an\nactually create your own workforce there.\n\n75\n00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.390\nAnd that's where we see the terms zombie\narmy, or if we call Ronnie a bot,\n\n76\n00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.270\nwe can say a bot net, or robot network,\nso to speak, or bot network.\n\n77\n00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.860\nSo there are different\ntypes of denial of service.\n\n78\n00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.720\nWe can have what's called a reflective.\n\n79\n00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.260\nSo let's say I'm the attacker and since I\nhave control over Ronnie's system because\n\n80\n00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.080\nI've infected his system and\nnow I know his IP address and everything.\n\n81\n00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.330\nI could go ahead and\nspoof my IP address and\n\n82\n00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.790\nremember that's something\nthat's very easy to do.\n\n83\n00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.100\nYou can spoof certain things,\nMAC addresses, IP addresses.\n\n84\n00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.846\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and I'm\nthe attacker and I'm gonna go ahead and\n\n85\n00:04:21.846 --> 00:04:24.309\nspoof my IP address to\nRonnie's IP address.\n\n86\n00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:28.424\nSo if I go ahead and communicate\nwith this unsuspecting middle man.\n\n87\n00:04:28.424 --> 00:04:32.900\nAll right, if I go and ping them,\nlet's just give that example.\n\n88\n00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.040\nWho are they going to reply to?\n\n89\n00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.910\nWell, what do you think, Ronnie?\n\n90\n00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.360\n&gt;&gt; It should be my PC.\n\n91\n00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.910\n&gt;&gt; It should be your PC, all right.\n\n92\n00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.158\nSo if the attacker is\nspoofing Ronnie's PC,\n\n93\n00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:46.000\nthen this unsuspecting middle\nman doesn't know that and\n\n94\n00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.927\nthey're just trying to respond to what\nthey believe is a legitimate request.\n\n95\n00:04:49.927 --> 00:04:55.103\nAnd so that might not seem like a big deal\nhere and this is called a reflective.\n\n96\n00:04:55.103 --> 00:04:57.574\nAnd you can see how it\nreflects back to Ronnie.\n\n97\n00:04:57.574 --> 00:05:00.435\nBut what if I were to go ahead and\n\n98\n00:05:00.435 --> 00:05:06.172\nping the broadcast address of\nan entire network here, okay?\n\n99\n00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:10.717\nSo if the attacker system\npings all of these systems,\n\n100\n00:05:10.717 --> 00:05:14.580\nnow who are they going\nto be responding to?\n\n101\n00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.830\nWell, guess what.\n\n102\n00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.810\nPoor Ronnie.\n\n103\n00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.060\nIs not going to have a great day here,\nright?\n\n104\n00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.110\nSo his system could be inundated with and\n\n105\n00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.370\npossible even have what's called\na permanent denial of service where\n\n106\n00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.800\nit just means that that\nsystem is brought down.\n\n107\n00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.840\nIt needs even perhaps some kind\nof maintenance at that point.\n\n108\n00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.130\nIt's literally disabled.\n\n109\n00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:42.180\nSo that would be when we see that\nreflective attack being amplified by\n\n110\n00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.880\npinging that broadcast IP address, that's\ncalled an amplified reflective attack.\n\n111\n00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.780\nSo when you hear those terms,\njust kind of visualize this in your head.\n\n112\n00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.050\nI think it'll help you on the exam there.\n\n113\n00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.870\nSome other terms would be friendly.\n\n114\n00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.220\nSo, and that was actually a Smurf attack,\nwhat I just showed you there.\n\n115\n00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.890\nSo when you see this term, okay,\n\n116\n00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.270\nSmurf attack, it's not little creatures\nhopping around or anything like that.\n\n117\n00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.270\nOr little mini creatures,\n\n118\n00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.070\nwhatever [LAUGH] the Smurfs,\nyou guys know what I'm talking about.\n\n119\n00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.440\nBut that's what it is.\n\n120\n00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:19.890\nAnd a friendly denial of service\nattack is when let's say Disney, okay.\n\n121\n00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.960\nSo I have kids and I wanted to shop and\nbuy them some things.\n\n122\n00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.110\nThey had an 80% off sale.\n\n123\n00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.430\nAnd I don't know if you guys ever shop on\nthe Disney store but it's so expensive and\n\n124\n00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.780\nthey rarely have really\ngood sales like that.\n\n125\n00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.720\nSo I go to their website hoping to score\na bunch of loot and well, guess what?\n\n126\n00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.820\nI received, it was a really cute error and\nexception handling message, it was Mr.\n\n127\n00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.580\nFix It, Felix Jr.\nand he was holding his little hammer and\n\n128\n00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.510\nhe said he was gonna be working on it and\nfixing this problem right away.\n\n129\n00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.480\nBut that's a true example of\na friendly denial of service attack,\n\n130\n00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.320\nwhen your systems really\nare legitimately inundated.\n\n131\n00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.556\nAnd it's not from a malicious attack,\na malicious source.\n\n132\n00:06:58.556 --> 00:07:00.020\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee,\n\n133\n00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.930\nhelp us to make sure that we\ncement this concept in our heads.\n\n134\n00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.922\nIn terms of denial of service and\ndistributed denial of service.\n\n135\n00:07:06.922 --> 00:07:09.757\nSo let's make sure we understand\nwhat the differences are and\n\n136\n00:07:09.757 --> 00:07:11.370\nwhat the overall purpose is.\n\n137\n00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.550\nIt doesn't seem like that's its purpose\nis to try and really get in there and\n\n138\n00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.350\nsteal any information or\ncompromise any systems.\n\n139\n00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.200\nSo what is it?\n\n140\n00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.110\nWhat's the differences, and\nwhat is it that we're trying to accomplish\n\n141\n00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.040\nwhen we see somebody doing\nan denial of service?\n\n142\n00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.570\nOr if I'm trying to do it?\n\n143\n00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so differences, and\nwhat do you mean by differences here?\n\n144\n00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.610\nDifferences in the sense that-\n&gt;&gt; The idea of what we call a denial of\n\n145\n00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.020\nservice and a distributed denial service.\n\n146\n00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.648\n&gt;&gt; Okay, gotcha.\nSo denial of service could be just from\n\n147\n00:07:37.648 --> 00:07:42.446\none particular source whereas distributed\ndenial of service means all of those\n\n148\n00:07:42.446 --> 00:07:47.529\ndifferent bots that I have infected are\nnow, you see the terms handlers, masters,\n\n149\n00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:52.325\nherders, that would be the attacker that's\nin charge of all those many systems\n\n150\n00:07:52.325 --> 00:07:56.692\nthat could physically be distributed\nagainst many geographic Region,\n\n151\n00:07:56.692 --> 00:07:58.797\nso that's the difference there.\n\n152\n00:07:58.797 --> 00:08:03.703\nSo a denial of service, could just be,\nit could be a construction worker, or\n\n153\n00:08:03.703 --> 00:08:06.647\nan attacker posing as\na construction worker,\n\n154\n00:08:06.647 --> 00:08:11.520\nwith like a back hoe cutting into\na fiber optic cable like a backbone.\n\n155\n00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.970\nAnd, that would even, your physically\ncausing a type of denial of service.\n\n156\n00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.390\nIt's not distributed because that\nattacker was in one location\n\n157\n00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.370\nwhen the event occurred.\n\n158\n00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.520\nSo that's the difference there.\n\n159\n00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:27.740\nAnd a lot of them won't even see\nbandwidth denial of service.\n\n160\n00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.590\nA lot of our equipment,\nour networking equipment now,\n\n161\n00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.890\ncan handle these types and see,\nlook, that looks suspicious.\n\n162\n00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:37.730\nI'm gonna go ahead and block incoming\ntraffic from that particular IP range and\n\n163\n00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:38.910\nthings like that.\n\n164\n00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.330\nBut those are the terms\nthat you do need to know.\n\n165\n00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.550\nAnd if we look at my screen I can\neven show you a couple of tools that\n\n166\n00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.330\nyou could use.\n\n167\n00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:51.280\nSo on that particular Friday when we saw\nsites going down and we weren't able,\n\n168\n00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.670\nthat attack, when it affected\nthose IOT devices, it brought\n\n169\n00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:01.890\ndown sites like Yahoo, Reddit, PayPal,\nI mean we're talking big sites here.\n\n170\n00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.150\nAnd so if i'm sitting here trying\nto access a couple of sites and\n\n171\n00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.067\nI can't get there,\nI don't know if it's my system,\n\n172\n00:09:06.067 --> 00:09:08.230\nI start doing some normal\nconnectivity tests.\n\n173\n00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.660\nWell you can also use web sites\nsuch as this downdetector.com to\n\n174\n00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.020\nsee the statistics for\ndifferent websites that are down.\n\n175\n00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:19.600\nYou could also look at something like\nthis called our internetpulse.net and\n\n176\n00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.940\nthis is basically a chart, we've got\nsome some red here, and this red is bad.\n\n177\n00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:31.280\nIt indicates high latency and any kind of\nproblems would be viewable on this chart.\n\n178\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.640\nWe see our top level service providers\nhere, this is the backbone of the network.\n\n179\n00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.420\nSo we can kind of identify\nwherein lies that problem if\n\n180\n00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.156\nthere was a cable that was cut,\nthat's actually happened before.\n\n181\n00:09:42.156 --> 00:09:45.673\nYou could see,you'll see a lot,\na lot of red there but\n\n182\n00:09:45.673 --> 00:09:48.212\nthat's some tools that you could use.\n\n183\n00:09:48.212 --> 00:09:52.531\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee, before we move on, I\nthink earlier we had mentioned a date, and\n\n184\n00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:57.120\nyou had talked about November 21st, but\nI think it was actually October 21st.\n\n185\n00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.820\n&gt;&gt; Did I say, yes, yeah guys,\nit's October 21st 2016.\n\n186\n00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:01.490\nSorry about that.\n\n187\n00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:04.380\n&gt;&gt; All right, let's talk about some\nother different types of attacks.\n\n188\n00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.750\nThere's one that you also have that\nwe need to talk about briefly,\n\n189\n00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.730\nwhich is the idea of man in the middle,\nit sounds simple enough so,\n\n190\n00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.600\nwhat do we need to understand about this?\n\n191\n00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n192\n00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.400\nMan in the middle, so there's actually\nan episode, if you guys are studying here\n\n193\n00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.540\nwith the security plus, the was\na specific episode for wireless attacks.\n\n194\n00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.430\nSo, wireless attacks are,\nI guess, more popular,\n\n195\n00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.830\nbecause they're easier to execute.\n\n196\n00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.830\nBut also remember you can\nhave wired attacks as well.\n\n197\n00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.760\nSo, man in the middle, if you think about\nthe game maybe you played as a kid called\n\n198\n00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.090\nmonkey in the middle, and you had\nsomeone in the middle trying to catch or\n\n199\n00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.440\nintercept that ball.\n\n200\n00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.810\nWell, that's the concept here.\n\n201\n00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.660\nSometimes you even may see in\ndocumentation referred to as monkey in\n\n202\n00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:47.570\nthe middle attacks.\n\n203\n00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.680\nBut man in the middle, monkey in the\nmiddle, it means you have someone whose\n\n204\n00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.780\ntrying to intercept that communication for\nsome purpose, whatever their motive is.\n\n205\n00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:02.850\nSo a replay attack is a type of man in\nthe middle attack, the difference is\n\n206\n00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:08.110\nthat let's say this individual wanted to\ngo ahead and authenticate to this server.\n\n207\n00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.510\nSo they go ahead and\nthey send their password.\n\n208\n00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:15.240\nMaybe they're using an older, antiquated\nprotocol that sends the password in\n\n209\n00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.757\nplain or clear text, and if I have\nphysical access, maybe I've tapped in or\n\n210\n00:11:19.757 --> 00:11:24.291\nI've used social engineering to gain\naccess into the server room somehow.\n\n211\n00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:28.376\nAnd I have literally plugged my\nlaptop into this switch here and\n\n212\n00:11:28.376 --> 00:11:33.153\nI've set up port mirroring,\nI've been able to compromise that switch,\n\n213\n00:11:33.153 --> 00:11:38.510\nwhen the legitimate user sends the\npassword to the server well guess what?\n\n214\n00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:43.020\nNow the attacker gets the exact\ntraffic sent to their system.\n\n215\n00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.060\nSo now I see Ronnie's password.\n\n216\n00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.340\nI can go ahead and\nwait until Ronnie logs off.\n\n217\n00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.080\nMaybe he goes to lunch I can use\nhis user name and password and\n\n218\n00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.732\nthen send it to the server.\n\n219\n00:11:53.732 --> 00:11:58.010\nThe server's not going to be\nable to notice the difference so\n\n220\n00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:03.580\nthat would be an example of a man\nin the middle attack there.\n\n221\n00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.320\nThe replay, the term replay means\nif you are obtaining information\n\n222\n00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.100\nyou're holding it to be used at a later\ntime, okay, session cookies or whatever.\n\n223\n00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.750\nSo by introducing things like time stamps,\n\n224\n00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:20.320\nsession IDs, we can eliminate a lot of\nthese types of attacks from occurring.\n\n225\n00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.740\n&gt;&gt; Actually, that's a very good point for\n\n226\n00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:25.130\nus to make when we start\nseeing information like this.\n\n227\n00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.350\nNotice that in the idea of the man in the\nmiddle attack it does take a little bit\n\n228\n00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.480\nmore access to the systems\nthat you have on hand.\n\n229\n00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.410\nWhereas on denial of service in\nwhich Cherokee just described and\n\n230\n00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:38.240\nhelped us to understand and\nsummarize we saw the idea of the attack.\n\n231\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.150\nAnd those attacks can happen\nfrom anywhere on this planet.\n\n232\n00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:45.470\nAnd then even against one particular\ncompany or even ISPs as well.\n\n233\n00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.520\nBut in the man in the middle attack it's\nvery difficult to make it happen across\n\n234\n00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.280\nmultiple networks like that.\n\n235\n00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.380\nSo this one you may find out that for\nyou to make it effectively work\n\n236\n00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.510\nyou have to have physical\naccess into that network and so\n\n237\n00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.820\nthat's also a clear point that we also\nwanna make sure that we understand.\n\n238\n00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:04.760\nNow another type of attack that we can\ntalk about here is one called spoofing.\n\n239\n00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.230\nSo Cherokee help us out here.\n\n240\n00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:09.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so I mentioned that term\nlike spoofing an IP address or\n\n241\n00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:12.170\nspoofing a Mac address.\n\n242\n00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:16.470\nNow and you may be thinking for\nour media access address\n\n243\n00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:24.210\nwe hear burned in a lot, physical address,\nethernet adapter address.\n\n244\n00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:25.480\nIt can be changed, right.\n\n245\n00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.310\nSo we normally don't fiddle with\nthose types of things but it can.\n\n246\n00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.910\nSo it's not fool proof, okay.\n\n247\n00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:36.960\nThose are workarounds and\nit's not very secretive, okay.\n\n248\n00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:42.220\nSo a lot of even basic attackers\nwould know about this, so\n\n249\n00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:47.500\nnot only do we see spoofing of,\nmanipulation of header information,\n\n250\n00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:51.220\nthings like that, but\nwe also can get emails sometimes.\n\n251\n00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.395\nOkay we see these fishing scams and if you\nwant to go ahead and take a look at my\n\n252\n00:13:55.395 --> 00:13:59.930\nscreen, we can see that here there are a\ncouple cool tools that I found, Ronnie.\n\n253\n00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:05.890\nOne is by OpenDNS which I think Cisco owns\nnow and then the other is by SonicWALL.\n\n254\n00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.440\nSo we're gonna go ahead and\ntake a little test here.\n\n255\n00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.600\nAnd I know this writing is really small\nbut if you guys just do a search on Google\n\n256\n00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:18.510\nfor OpenDNS Fishing quiz, you'll go\nahead and find this, it's really short.\n\n257\n00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.970\nIt's only like 10 questions for each of\nthese, and they're kind of testing you to\n\n258\n00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:27.200\nsee how keen of an eye you have for\nthese types of false emails.\n\n259\n00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.110\nSo by definition, fishing is going to be\n\n260\n00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:37.180\nspoofing a legitimate website and\nyou see these attacks like, what was it?\n\n261\n00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:41.770\nWith Scarlet Johanson and a lot of these\nmovie stars, they're getting emails\n\n262\n00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:45.340\nsaying, hey we need you to go ahead and\nauthenticate your account.\n\n263\n00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:49.250\nAnd they say, yeah I need to go ahead and\nput in my username and password.\n\n264\n00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:52.920\nThey see that hyperlink in the email, it's\neasy, it's tempting to just go ahead and\n\n265\n00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.980\nclick it but don't click it.\n\n266\n00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.010\nAnd let's take a look here and\nwe'll see if you can identify them.\n\n267\n00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.300\nSo, we'll go ahead and hit get started.\n\n268\n00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.790\nNow this particular one it says,\nYahoo mail is upgrading.\n\n269\n00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:10.640\nThis email is from Yahoo Customer Care and\nwe're sending it to every Yahoo email,\n\n270\n00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.970\nevery Yahoo email user accounts owner for\nsafety.\n\n271\n00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.850\nExcuse me if I can't even read here.\n\n272\n00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:20.040\nWe're having congestions due to enormous\nregistrations of Yahoo accounts, so\n\n273\n00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.550\nwe're shutting down some\nof the Yahoo accounts and\n\n274\n00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.640\nyour account was among\nthose to be deleted.\n\n275\n00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.450\nAnd I actually,\nthey kind of use poor grammar here and\n\n276\n00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:33.160\nthat's one of the reasons why you could\nsee that it might not be legitimate.\n\n277\n00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.690\nBut another tactic here that they're\ntrying to take advantage of is some kind\n\n278\n00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:38.741\nof scare tactic.\n\n279\n00:15:38.741 --> 00:15:41.650\nSo they're saying, look,\nif you don't go ahead and\n\n280\n00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:45.270\ndo what I want you to do we might go\nahead and suspend your account and\n\n281\n00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:49.105\nif this is something you use,\nthen that might cause a concern for you.\n\n282\n00:15:49.105 --> 00:15:53.893\nNow if you also look at the URL,\nwe're gonna be looking for things like I'm\n\n283\n00:15:53.893 --> 00:15:58.840\nsure you guys have already heard HTTPS\nis the secure version of HTTP, right?\n\n284\n00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:06.260\nIf we're using those additional security\nprotocols, but look here if I have HTTPS,\n\n285\n00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:12.310\nokay, but that's not the only thing you\nshould be looking at here in the URL.\n\n286\n00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.870\nThis is actually not a YAHOO domain, so\n\n287\n00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:20.040\nwhy would YAHOO not be sending you\ninformation from their own system?\n\n288\n00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.250\nSo just kinda things like that and\nit's kinda cool if you take the quiz,\n\n289\n00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.200\nat the very end of the quiz, it'll point\nall these little details out for you.\n\n290\n00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.170\nSo that you can even pass\nthis out to your employees,\n\n291\n00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:35.910\nor create some kind of test that's\nsimilar to this, just to bring awareness.\n\n292\n00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.950\nAnd there's another company\nthat does it as well,\n\n293\n00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:41.350\nit's called Sonic Wall,\nanother equipment manufacture.\n\n294\n00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:45.800\nAnd I kind of like this one as well,\nbecause they put it into an email format.\n\n295\n00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.090\nSo here they're saying,\nlook you've got an email.\n\n296\n00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.170\nWho are they saying they're from?\n\n297\n00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:50.710\nThe PayPal team, all right?\n\n298\n00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.360\nA lot of people have PayPal accounts, so\n\n299\n00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.600\nit's very believable to\nreceive an email from PayPal.\n\n300\n00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.410\nSomethings that could clue you in, again,\n\n301\n00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:02.180\nif we look at the spelling here\non your credit card information.\n\n302\n00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.270\nCredit is spelled incorrectly.\n\n303\n00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:10.200\nAnd then they also have brief little how\nto, but the steps aren't very clear,\n\n304\n00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.860\nthey're just kind of general, so\nit doesn't really look legit.\n\n305\n00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:14.800\nThings like that.\n\n306\n00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.740\nYou're just kind of looking for those.\n\n307\n00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:19.415\nSo those are cool little tools\nyou guys can use as well.\n\n308\n00:17:19.415 --> 00:17:23.380\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of times when you start\nseeing the idea of fishing scams,\n\n309\n00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:27.120\nit really is targeted, hopefully,\nfor the person that's fairly\n\n310\n00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:31.250\nignorant on the way that certain\ninstitutions are networking.\n\n311\n00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:35.850\nSo, they normally target people that may\nhave actually just started doing things\n\n312\n00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:40.000\nlike online banking and\nthey're not exactly sure how this works.\n\n313\n00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.260\nSo what you might also end up seeing\na lot of times is just an email that\n\n314\n00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.160\nlooks like it's from your bank.\n\n315\n00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.220\nThat tells you that they have\nbeen compromised somehow and\n\n316\n00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.820\nyou are on this list and\nall you have to do is fill this out.\n\n317\n00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.320\nAnd then that will actually\nhelp them in that process and\n\n318\n00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.096\neverything about that email because\nof the way we format emails today,\n\n319\n00:17:56.096 --> 00:17:59.690\nit looks legitimately 100% from your bank.\n\n320\n00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:03.640\nBut the only way for you to find out for\nsure is never to click on any email like\n\n321\n00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.940\nthat, but is to go directly to\nthe bank site itself and verify and\n\n322\n00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.660\nthey'll tell you if you actually\ndo have something like this.\n\n323\n00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can even call\nthem if you have a question,\n\n324\n00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:15.180\nespecially if it's like\na financial institution, yeah,\n\n325\n00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.400\njust call your banking institution say,\nhey, do you have a fraud department?\n\n326\n00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.540\nI received an email I'm just checking to\nmake sure that you guys are legitimately\n\n327\n00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.220\ntrying to communicate with me.\n\n328\n00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.890\nAnd something that,\nyou always kinda wanna think about,\n\n329\n00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:30.540\nlook, if you're not the one who's\ninitiating that communication,\n\n330\n00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:34.380\nyou might wanna go ahead and\njust be kind of leery of any kind of\n\n331\n00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.210\nunsolicited emails that just kind\nof happened to land in your inbox.\n\n332\n00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:41.710\nAnd like Ronnie said, just never\nclick on those hyperlinks there, so.\n\n333\n00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:45.420\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, very scary, if you don't know\nanything about whoever sent you the email.\n\n334\n00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.390\nIn other words, if it's unexpected, one of\nthe key things we normally tell people is\n\n335\n00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:53.252\ndon't click on an email link\nfrom someone you don't know.\n\n336\n00:18:53.252 --> 00:18:58.390\nIt's kinda the easiest, safest rule\nof thumb, and even at that point,\n\n337\n00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:02.600\nif you're not expecting it, it's something\nthat you don't want to do as well.\n\n338\n00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.550\nSo even if it might have\ncome from Cherokee and\n\n339\n00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:09.450\nit says you need to change your account\nright now, well, I might actually go,\n\n340\n00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.490\nwell, I wasn't expecting that email,\nit's not like she told me that I\n\n341\n00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:16.220\nwas gonna have an email that said\nthat something needed to be changed.\n\n342\n00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.830\nIt just came unexpectedly, and\n\n343\n00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.230\nthat means they could have\nspoofed her email address itself,\n\n344\n00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:26.280\nas well as actually now trying to pull off\nsome type of phishing scam, which I would\n\n345\n00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.980\njust click the link on because I trust\nthat Cherokee is not going to do that.\n\n346\n00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:33.650\nSo you do have to be careful in\na couple of instances especially\n\n347\n00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.770\nwith the idea of using some type\nof phishing attack as well.\n\n348\n00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:41.580\nNow, speaking of the idea of email,\nwe wanna move on to the big one spam.\n\n349\n00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.040\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm sure you guys\nhave all had some kind of\n\n350\n00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.480\nspam in your junk folder before.\n\n351\n00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.090\nWe all get it, we don't want it.\n\n352\n00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.950\nIt really causes waste, okay?\n\n353\n00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:56.790\nIt wastes network bandwidth, it wastes\nhuman time resources sifting through it.\n\n354\n00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:00.090\nSo you just wanna check\nyour spam filter levels.\n\n355\n00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:03.290\nSome companies even utilize, well,\nyou should be using blacklist for\n\n356\n00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:07.300\nyour mail server or even white list\nif you wanted to go to that extreme.\n\n357\n00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:13.050\nBut spam is going to be\nour unwanted emails.\n\n358\n00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:16.010\nYou can find email lists\nall over the Internet.\n\n359\n00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:20.600\nAnd generally, that's just how we end\nup with that or may be you go ahead and\n\n360\n00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.920\nregister on some particular site.\n\n361\n00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.900\nSo spam as our unwanted email.\n\n362\n00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:30.200\nWe also see these terms when we talk\nabout phishing, we see spear phishing and\n\n363\n00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.630\nwhaling and\nthose are little more definitive,\n\n364\n00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.260\na little more specific types of phishing.\n\n365\n00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:39.645\nSo spear fishing would be,\nif we look at things like spam and\n\n366\n00:20:39.645 --> 00:20:42.490\nphishing, those\nare generally opportunistic.\n\n367\n00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:46.508\nSo opportunistic attacks would be where\nI just purchased and email list and\n\n368\n00:20:46.508 --> 00:20:49.634\nhopefully out of the thousands\nemails that I'm sending,\n\n369\n00:20:49.634 --> 00:20:52.148\nI'm gonna get a few fall into my scam.\n\n370\n00:20:52.148 --> 00:20:54.400\nBut spear phishing is\ngoing to be more targeted,\n\n371\n00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.580\nso I might even know a little bit.\n\n372\n00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.540\nLet's say I wanted to go ahead and\nattack Ronnie, sorry Ronnie, I'm just\n\n373\n00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:03.870\nreally beating out this episode here,\nbut I wanna go ahead and attack Ronnie.\n\n374\n00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:07.860\nMaybe I know his name, I know a few\ndetails that I could include into that\n\n375\n00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.710\nmessage that makes it seem a little\nmore legit, it will go ahead and\n\n376\n00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:16.860\npick his interest and maybe increase the\nprobability of him clicking on that link.\n\n377\n00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.980\nI've actually seen a study\nthat’s interesting,\n\n378\n00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.530\nwhen they do include a few\nbits of information or\n\n379\n00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:26.230\neven something really general,\nlet's say after New Year's Eve, okay?\n\n380\n00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.830\nA lot of people go to your holiday, we'll\njust make it a little more generic, right?\n\n381\n00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.970\nAfter the holidays you could sent out\nan email to say, hey, look I found this\n\n382\n00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:37.960\nembarrassing pic from the holiday party,\ngo ahead and click here to see it, okay?\n\n383\n00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.540\nThey'll go ahead and\n\n384\n00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.530\nclick, it just really does increase\nthe probability of that happening.\n\n385\n00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:42.920\nSo you have to be careful.\n\n386\n00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.500\nAnd then whaling,\nthis is even more specific,\n\n387\n00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:50.590\nit's a type of spear phishing in which\nI'm going after someone who hires\n\n388\n00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:55.450\nperhaps usually high network worth if you\nthink about it, I'm the attacker, right?\n\n389\n00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:58.640\nAnd so, an attacker if you think about it,\nthat's there business.\n\n390\n00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:03.266\nAnd so as a business individual, you'd\nwanna go ahead and get you the most ROI or\n\n391\n00:22:03.266 --> 00:22:04.660\nreturn on investment.\n\n392\n00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.796\nAnd this is their business,\nso they just wanna get, hey,\n\n393\n00:22:07.796 --> 00:22:11.572\nwhy am I gonna go ahead and go after\nall these people if I can't extort or\n\n394\n00:22:11.572 --> 00:22:14.599\nblackmail them,\nthey don't have anything to give me.\n\n395\n00:22:14.599 --> 00:22:18.979\nSo whaling is where you're going after\npeople maybe their executives for\n\n396\n00:22:18.979 --> 00:22:21.960\na Fortune 500 company or\nsomething like that.\n\n397\n00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:24.390\nAll right.\n\n398\n00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:27.660\n&gt;&gt; There's a couple of other ones here\nthat we also need to kinda throw in,\n\n399\n00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.008\na little bit less well know\nthan the idea of spam.\n\n400\n00:22:31.008 --> 00:22:35.871\nSo Cherokee, I see on your list we're\nsupposed to talk about something\n\n401\n00:22:35.871 --> 00:22:40.695\ncalled spim and spit [LAUGH] and vishing\n&gt;&gt; So vishing is going to be very similar\n\n402\n00:22:40.695 --> 00:22:45.315\nas well to spit, but vishing is going\nto be more of a social engineering\n\n403\n00:22:45.315 --> 00:22:49.990\ntype of attack where someone is trying\nto use the telephone to go ahead and\n\n404\n00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:54.410\nmanipulate you to go ahead and\ngain whatever it is that they're after.\n\n405\n00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:56.960\nSo that's vishing, the differences there.\n\n406\n00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.910\nAnd so next we're gonna go ahead and\ntalk about Xmas attacks.\n\n407\n00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:04.783\nSo an Xmas attack or Christmas tree attack\nis where we're sending that Christmas\n\n408\n00:23:04.783 --> 00:23:07.435\ntree packet where\nthe header information or\n\n409\n00:23:07.435 --> 00:23:10.800\nthe TCP header information\nhas been manipulated.\n\n410\n00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.760\nSo our flags have been set to an on state,\nso that's where the name comes from.\n\n411\n00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.760\nYou're turning on those particular\nflags to like you're turning\n\n412\n00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.840\non the lights on a Christmas tree.\n\n413\n00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.828\nAnd you're going through enumerating\nthe ports on your victim and so\n\n414\n00:23:26.828 --> 00:23:32.246\nyou're trying to go ahead and query\nthose ports to see what ports are open,\n\n415\n00:23:32.246 --> 00:23:36.899\nwhich ports could be a vulnerability for\na particular attacks.\n\n416\n00:23:36.899 --> 00:23:41.610\nSo it's usually a precursor and\nsomething we could here is to go ahead and\n\n417\n00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:45.953\nutilize an intrusion detection or\nintrusion prevention system.\n\n418\n00:23:45.953 --> 00:23:50.072\nThat would be your first\nline of attack there.\n\n419\n00:23:50.072 --> 00:23:53.631\nBut you could also use some kind\nof network monitoring tools,\n\n420\n00:23:53.631 --> 00:23:58.149\neven something free like Wireshark,\nto go ahead and look at that traffic, and\n\n421\n00:23:58.149 --> 00:24:01.860\nactually identify and\nanalyze that header information there.\n\n422\n00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.590\n&gt;&gt; Now, Cherokee, we also need to mention,\nbecause we're kind of running out of time,\n\n423\n00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.970\nand that means we have\na lot more to cover.\n\n424\n00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:11.600\nLet's also talk about\nthis idea of pharming but\n\n425\n00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.300\nit's spelled funny in the way\nthat we tend to use it.\n\n426\n00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.351\nSo what is that about?\n\n427\n00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:18.944\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's with a P-H, and just like\na lot of the other terms that we've said\n\n428\n00:24:18.944 --> 00:24:22.429\nhere before, you definitely wanna go\nahead and, if you haven't already,\n\n429\n00:24:22.429 --> 00:24:25.445\nlook at your objective list,\nbecause they are spelled strange.\n\n430\n00:24:25.445 --> 00:24:30.447\nAnd that's just so that you can use\nit in the proper context, right?\n\n431\n00:24:30.447 --> 00:24:32.727\nWe're not going outside and gardening, no.\n\n432\n00:24:32.727 --> 00:24:37.869\nPharming is going to be a type\nof DNS redirection, okay?\n\n433\n00:24:37.869 --> 00:24:41.740\nSo there are a lot of different techniques\nthat one can go ahead and utilize.\n\n434\n00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:47.230\nYeah, we'll wait and talk about typo\nspotting a little bit differently, but\n\n435\n00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:53.450\nif I'm able to go ahead and, we'll\nlook here at poisoning, DNS poisoning.\n\n436\n00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:54.960\nIf you think about DNS,\n\n437\n00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.530\nright, DNS is going to take those\nhost names that are easy for\n\n438\n00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:04.020\nhumans to remember and go ahead and\ntranslate them into IP addresses.\n\n439\n00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:10.560\nSo DNS servers are basically databases\nholding all of this information.\n\n440\n00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:15.404\nSo if someone's able, through different\nways, various ways, to go ahead and\n\n441\n00:25:15.404 --> 00:25:19.741\nmodify DNS information, a very common\nway is to go ahead and actually,\n\n442\n00:25:19.741 --> 00:25:23.093\nwhat's called poison, or\nmodify those DNS records.\n\n443\n00:25:23.093 --> 00:25:28.902\nSo that when I'm typing in www.cnn.com,\nit's actually redirecting me to my,\n\n444\n00:25:28.902 --> 00:25:32.955\nbuy your Canadian pharmaceuticals\nhere kinda website.\n\n445\n00:25:32.955 --> 00:25:36.825\nSo they're getting some sort of free\nadvertising by taking advantage of\n\n446\n00:25:36.825 --> 00:25:38.755\nprotocols in that sense.\n\n447\n00:25:38.755 --> 00:25:42.205\n&gt;&gt; Well, Cherokee, thank you again for\nhelping us at least to go through some of\n\n448\n00:25:42.205 --> 00:25:46.360\nthe different types of attacks that\nwe're likely to have to understand.\n\n449\n00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.860\nNot only for the CompTIA Security+ exam,\nbut because more and\n\n450\n00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.940\nmore in the world that we're living\nin today, we're seeing a lot\n\n451\n00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:57.250\nmore attacks that have gone along not\nonly against regular users at home.\n\n452\n00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:01.910\nBut also, of course, well, business users\nas well, and we as security professionals\n\n453\n00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:07.520\nneed to be able to identify and understand\nat least basics of what's happening here.\n\n454\n00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.610\nAnd so we've got a lot more for\nus to actually cover, but\n\n455\n00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:14.430\nthis is a great place for\nus to also end this episode as well.\n\n456\n00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:18.110\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n457\n00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:19.107\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n458\n00:26:19.107 --> 00:26:23.411\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore CompTIA Security Plus.\n\n459\n00:26:23.411 --> 00:26:29.362\n[MUSIC]\n\n460\n00:26:29.362 --> 00:26:32.302\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:08.583 --> 00:00:12.702\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.702 --> 00:00:15.841\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:19.998\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong, and today\nwe're taking a look at CompTIA Security+.\n\n7\n00:00:19.998 --> 00:00:22.850\nWe're specifically gonna be talking\nabout some of the different ways we can\n\n8\n00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.360\nsummarize various attacks that we're\nlikely to see in the environment that\n\n9\n00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.735\nwe're actually serving in, but\nhere to help us out is wanna be Ms.\n\n10\n00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:30.310\nCherokee Boose.\n\n11\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.264\nCherokee, welcome back.\n\n12\n00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:32.715\nAnd this is our part two, isn't it?\n\n13\n00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:35.825\n&gt;&gt; Yes, so we had a lot to\ncover in that last episode.\n\n14\n00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:37.805\nSo we're gonna go ahead and continue.\n\n15\n00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:40.925\nThe last topic that we talked\nabout was DNS poisoning.\n\n16\n00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:45.251\nSo if we go ahead and take a look at my\nscreen, I do wanna show you guys something\n\n17\n00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:49.395\nthat's similar in the name, but\nit's a completely different concept.\n\n18\n00:00:49.395 --> 00:00:51.696\nAnd I know this isn't a networking class,\nand\n\n19\n00:00:51.696 --> 00:00:54.960\nI'm sure there are episodes that\nreally define the ARP process.\n\n20\n00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.620\nBut I just kind wanna cover that again so\nthat you really understand.\n\n21\n00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.470\nWith a lot of these attacks, and normally\nthat's why people recommend taking NET+ or\n\n22\n00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.005\nhaving networking experience\nbefore you go into Security+.\n\n23\n00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:11.323\nBecause without that prior knowledge of\nthese protocols it's gonna be difficult to\n\n24\n00:01:11.323 --> 00:01:14.760\nunderstand why these attacks\nactually are so successful.\n\n25\n00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.516\nSo let's take a look here at my screen.\n\n26\n00:01:17.516 --> 00:01:22.960\nAnd let's say that this system down here,\nokay, wanted to go ahead and communicate.\n\n27\n00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.865\nIf we think about ARP,\naddress resolution protocol,\n\n28\n00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:31.900\nwe're taking those IP addresses and\nwe're working at layer two.\n\n29\n00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.540\nSo we need MAC addresses for\nour switch here.\n\n30\n00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.480\nSo our particular system needs that\nMAC address to communicate with\n\n31\n00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.593\nthe other device.\n\n32\n00:01:39.593 --> 00:01:44.350\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nsend a message to Ronnie over here, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.920\nAnd if I've never sent\nhim a message before,\n\n34\n00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.580\nthen I'm not gonna have that\nmapping in my local cache here.\n\n35\n00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.260\nSo the first thing that my system does\nis to look to see if I have that IP to\n\n36\n00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.650\nMAC address mapping.\n\n37\n00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.990\nIf not, then my particular\nmachine is going to go ahead and\n\n38\n00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.710\nsend out a broadcast message.\n\n39\n00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.390\nAnd I'm basically asking for\n\n40\n00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.220\nsomeone to respond to me with\nthat particular MAC address.\n\n41\n00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.160\nSo whenever that node hears that,\nso Ronnie says, that's mine.\n\n42\n00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.150\nAnd he comes back with a unicast\nmessage to let me know, hey, Cherokee,\n\n43\n00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.440\nthis is my MAC address.\n\n44\n00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.280\nAnd I'm like, great, and\nI'm gonna write it down in my cache, and\n\n45\n00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.810\nthen I have it stored.\n\n46\n00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.910\nBut we've seen a lot of different attacks.\n\n47\n00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.030\nWe even see where we have\n\n48\n00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.200\nfalse broadcast messages generated\njust to see who responds.\n\n49\n00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.690\nAnd we can go ahead and\nget that information.\n\n50\n00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.460\nWe can modify the cache information.\n\n51\n00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.218\nThat's a very benign, rudimentary\ntype of attack where you're actually\n\n52\n00:02:43.218 --> 00:02:46.087\nmanually entering in those ARP records,\nbut\n\n53\n00:02:46.087 --> 00:02:50.105\nthere are also other different\ntypes of tools that you can use.\n\n54\n00:02:50.105 --> 00:02:54.474\nI'm trying to think here,\nwe have Ettercap and\n\n55\n00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:59.183\ndsniff, and\nI'll show you those in a few minutes.\n\n56\n00:02:59.183 --> 00:03:03.454\nBut if we look at this address resolution,\nokay, or ARP,\n\n57\n00:03:03.454 --> 00:03:06.430\nthat is why the poisoning is effective.\n\n58\n00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.430\nBecause there's no security that's\nintegrated into the ARP protocol.\n\n59\n00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.426\nAnd by taking advantages of\nthe weaknesses with this protocol,\n\n60\n00:03:14.426 --> 00:03:17.097\nthen we see these types of attacks happen.\n\n61\n00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:19.630\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee,\nwith this type of attack,\n\n62\n00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.663\nwhen we start talking about the idea of\nARP poisoning, what we're really trying to\n\n63\n00:03:23.663 --> 00:03:26.221\nget to is really something\nthat is kind of neat here.\n\n64\n00:03:26.221 --> 00:03:30.260\nWe want to be able to get access\nto someone else's ARP cache.\n\n65\n00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.940\nSo a server might be out there.\n\n66\n00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.190\nAnd what we're hoping for, of course,\nis to be able to spoof, let's say my own\n\n67\n00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.110\nmachine, as being one of the people\nthat has connected to it before.\n\n68\n00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.667\nNow when we do that we're actually taking\nmy MAC address and actually instead what's\n\n69\n00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:48.527\ngonna end up happening is we're gonna\nput Cherokee's IP address on it so\n\n70\n00:03:48.527 --> 00:03:52.033\nit actually ends up sending it,\nwell, I maybe be backward here.\n\n71\n00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:55.840\nSo actually it's actually gonna be-\n&gt;&gt; Here let's look at my diagram.\n\n72\n00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.595\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.\n\n73\n00:03:56.595 --> 00:03:57.197\n&gt;&gt; If we can show that.\n\n74\n00:03:57.197 --> 00:03:57.952\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n75\n00:03:57.952 --> 00:03:59.215\n&gt;&gt; And I think that might help.\nYeah, it's a very,\n\n76\n00:03:59.215 --> 00:04:01.155\nvery common type of attack here for\nARP poisoning.\n\n77\n00:04:01.155 --> 00:04:04.515\nSo let's change it up a bit, okay?\n\n78\n00:04:04.515 --> 00:04:07.885\nIn several different ways, I could go\nahead and put malware on my system to\n\n79\n00:04:07.885 --> 00:04:12.265\nobtain that or physically tapping into\na system to get that MAC address.\n\n80\n00:04:12.265 --> 00:04:14.880\nSo as long as you get those\nlittle nuggets of knowledge,\n\n81\n00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.020\nthat's what attackers are looking for,\nright?\n\n82\n00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.880\nSo what if they find the IP address\nof my default gateway to a network?\n\n83\n00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.420\nAnd if you think about it,\nyour default gateway is like that filter,\n\n84\n00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.760\nif we wanna leave our network\nwe have to go through it.\n\n85\n00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.730\nSo like Ronnie said,\n\n86\n00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.730\nif I am able to compromise that system's\ncache and I say, you know what?\n\n87\n00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.360\nYour default gateway does not have\nthe IP address of blah, blah,\n\n88\n00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.080\nblah, whatever the legitimate\nIP address is.\n\n89\n00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.812\nThey, in fact,\ngive it Ronnie's IP address, right?\n\n90\n00:04:43.812 --> 00:04:48.367\nSo now this individual is, and whomever\nelse I am able to modify that cache\n\n91\n00:04:48.367 --> 00:04:53.967\ninformation for, they're essentially just\nsending all their traffic right to Ronnie.\n\n92\n00:04:53.967 --> 00:04:57.880\nAnd his feet are kicked back and\nhe's having a good old time.\n\n93\n00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.720\nThat's a very common type\nof attack here as well,\n\n94\n00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.440\nthat's why it's still effective and\nbeing used.\n\n95\n00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.240\n&gt;&gt; This is actually one of the attacks\nthat most people end up cutting their\n\n96\n00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.640\nteeth on as they start to learn about it,\n\n97\n00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.040\nbecause it really does start with\ntheir basic networking knowledge,\n\n98\n00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.210\nallows them to be able to see how\nthe OSI model really effectively works.\n\n99\n00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.830\nBut then to show them that they can take\nadvantage of the tools that are out there\n\n100\n00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.400\nto help to test these systems as well.\n\n101\n00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.860\nNow along with this type of information,\nright,\n\n102\n00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.760\nthat's when these attacks can occur.\n\n103\n00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.220\nAnd then you can compromise,\nnot really the system as much as\n\n104\n00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.830\nbeing able to redirect where\nthe responding information ends up going.\n\n105\n00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.360\nAnd that's really the whole goal.\n\n106\n00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.160\nNow the other thing that we\n\n107\n00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.420\nalso wanna talk about is something that\nwe call privilege escalation as well, or\n\n108\n00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.750\nmaybe even also transitive access,\nI think is what you also have here.\n\n109\n00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so those two terms,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n110\n00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.740\ntake a look at privilege escalation first.\n\n111\n00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.640\nAnd so when we're talking\nabout certain applications\n\n112\n00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.590\nthat may utilize certain processes,\ndifferent apps,\n\n113\n00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:58.100\npieces of software can be coded to\nhave different access levels, okay?\n\n114\n00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.960\nSo if any kind of malware attack\nis able to take advantage of those\n\n115\n00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.870\naccess levels or any kind of background\nservices, then that's what they mean.\n\n116\n00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.120\nIf the attacker isn't logged in as an\nadministrative user, but they're able to\n\n117\n00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.380\ngo ahead and escalate their privileges by\njust relying on those dependencies there.\n\n118\n00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.610\nSo we won't go too far into applications\nin this particular episode.\n\n119\n00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.960\nThere is another one for that.\n\n120\n00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.040\nBut we'll also mention another\nconcept here for transitive access.\n\n121\n00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.350\nSo transitive access, transitive trust,\nfederated trusts, these terms are really\n\n122\n00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.780\nall used to describe the relationships\nbetween independent systems in\n\n123\n00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.790\norder to facilitate interoperability or\ncommunication between the two.\n\n124\n00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.340\nI mean, if you think about it,\nif you guys are instead of waking up and\n\n125\n00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.976\ndrinking your coffee and\nreading your newspaper,\n\n126\n00:06:49.976 --> 00:06:53.860\na lot of people will go ahead and\nbrowse different news sites, right?\n\n127\n00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.467\nSo I'm sure you've seen,\nor maybe you haven't, but\n\n128\n00:06:56.467 --> 00:07:00.320\nmaybe you'll take notice now if there\nare certain sites, you read an article and\n\n129\n00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.321\nyou might see some buttons at the bottom.\n\n130\n00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:05.079\nIt says like this on your Facebook page or\nshare on Twitter.\n\n131\n00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:08.475\nSo those little buttons,\nyou're utilizing the underlying,\n\n132\n00:07:08.475 --> 00:07:12.500\nthe underpinning APIs to go ahead and\nshare some information.\n\n133\n00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.040\nWe see this all the time online.\n\n134\n00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.650\nDifferent type forms of checking out.\n\n135\n00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.040\nWith PayPal, you don't have to input\nyour address and all that information.\n\n136\n00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.630\nYou just say,\nI'm gonna check out with PayPal.\n\n137\n00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:22.450\nThey know what to do.\n\n138\n00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:27.190\nAnd they're essentially forwarding\ninformation to a different provider and\n\n139\n00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.260\nthey're sharing.\n\n140\n00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.000\nSo a couple different types of\nexploits could happen here.\n\n141\n00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.800\nNumber one, you might really not\n\n142\n00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.840\nknow the moral stance of the company with\nwhom they're sharing that information.\n\n143\n00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.230\nThey might take that information and\ndo something malicious with it.\n\n144\n00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.194\nAnd then you also have to look at,\nfrom the client's side.\n\n145\n00:07:47.194 --> 00:07:53.142\nSo if the attacker is actually acting as\na client, they could somehow manipulate\n\n146\n00:07:53.142 --> 00:07:59.103\nthe information that they can obtain to\nperform some other type of attack there.\n\n147\n00:07:59.103 --> 00:08:02.069\nSo you just have to be careful.\n\n148\n00:08:02.069 --> 00:08:06.544\nAnd really, don't forget about when\nyou're designing apps and programs and\n\n149\n00:08:06.544 --> 00:08:10.150\nthe way that these websites and\nthe APIs are working together.\n\n150\n00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:13.870\nYou have to just look at all the little\nseams there to make sure that you're not\n\n151\n00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.630\nletting anything fall through the gaps.\n\n152\n00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.170\n&gt;&gt; The other thing that we also have\nhere that is on Cherokee's list for\n\n153\n00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:25.240\nus to address is what she calls\na malicious insider threat.\n\n154\n00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.360\nCherokee, what is\na malicious insider threat?\n\n155\n00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.020\n&gt;&gt; My goodness.\n\n156\n00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.710\nA malicious insider threat could\nbe several things, Ronnie.\n\n157\n00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.720\nIt could be the individual who got\npassed up on several promotions,\n\n158\n00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.900\nthey started hiring from\noutside instead of internal.\n\n159\n00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.050\nThey could have just not gotten\ntheir Christmas bonus last year.\n\n160\n00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:47.790\nOr maybe they just have some other\nkinda grudge against some company.\n\n161\n00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:52.770\nMaybe they've noticed that I don't really\nagree with the company's morals or\n\n162\n00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:53.940\ntheir mission anymore.\n\n163\n00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.650\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and sabotage.\n\n164\n00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:00.550\nAnd knowing an attacker's\nmotivation can often\n\n165\n00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.450\nhopefully mitigate the attack\nin the first place.\n\n166\n00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.640\nIf it's some kind of behavior that\nthat victim is actually involved in,\n\n167\n00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.860\nthey can kind of change that a little bit.\n\n168\n00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.530\nBut I mean don't underestimate\nany malicious insider.\n\n169\n00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.660\nSo when you break it down someone\nwho's bad on the inside, right?\n\n170\n00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:22.280\nSo that's really all it means, but\nthey can be some of the most detrimental\n\n171\n00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.910\ntypes of attackers cuz they're\nfamiliar with your organization.\n\n172\n00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.180\nThey know your weaknesses,\nyour vulnerabilities.\n\n173\n00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:33.000\nThey may already have access to certain\ninternal systems that otherwise\n\n174\n00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.560\nthe company has provisions set forth,\nthe security controls,\n\n175\n00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.910\nto prevent outsiders from\ncoming in behind that Firewall.\n\n176\n00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:44.670\nSo that's another thing, they may have\nbeen given legitimately access and\n\n177\n00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.740\nthen they're just deciding\nto use it maliciously.\n\n178\n00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.580\n&gt;&gt; And now that's actually a fairly\nnew term that I didn't know\n\n179\n00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.511\nwhat it was called, but\nwe used to call it the disgruntled guy.\n\n180\n00:09:53.511 --> 00:09:56.237\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The disgruntled worker inside of your\n\n181\n00:09:56.237 --> 00:09:58.370\nnetworks and you don't think about it.\n\n182\n00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.280\nBut that's all it takes.\n\n183\n00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.260\nIt doesn't take a lot of information,\nit really just takes that\n\n184\n00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:08.240\none individual being able to reveal\nwhat they actually want to do.\n\n185\n00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.380\nAnd somebody with a little bit of skill\ncan then of course go out on the internet,\n\n186\n00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:17.340\nsearch and try and figure out what they\ncan actually do to bring down your system\n\n187\n00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.580\nor to make the attacks that they want to.\n\n188\n00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.740\nSo just kinda realize, motivation is also\na very key one that we have to actually\n\n189\n00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:28.730\nkey in on in terms of the idea of some\ntype of attack that we need to look at.\n\n190\n00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.880\nNow, the other thing that we also\nhave listed here as part of some\n\n191\n00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.380\nof the exam adjectives is gonna\nbe the client side attacks.\n\n192\n00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.540\nNow, Cherokee what?\n\n193\n00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.160\nWhat are we really talking about here?\n\n194\n00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.076\nWhat does this mean?\n\n195\n00:10:39.076 --> 00:10:41.260\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n196\n00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.630\nAnd we're kind of talking about\napplications and programs here.\n\n197\n00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:46.100\nOop, that little monkey,\nI told you guys I'd show that to you.\n\n198\n00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.730\nThis is for dsniff, and\nwe can put those in the show notes also.\n\n199\n00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.902\nBut when we were talking about our AARP\nattacks, these would be some tools that\n\n200\n00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:57.130\ndsniff and Ettercap that you\nguys could can look at for\n\n201\n00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.882\nsome advanced type of AARP attacks.\n\n202\n00:10:59.882 --> 00:11:06.110\nBut if we hop on over to cert.org so, and\nlet me make an correction from a previous\n\n203\n00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:11.330\nepisode, I said that MIT actually\ndeveloped the original fuzz generator but\n\n204\n00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.560\nit was the University of Wisconsin,\nso go Wisconsin.\n\n205\n00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.600\nBut they actually come up with the class\nproject called the fuzz generator and\n\n206\n00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.610\nhere you can go ahead and there are a lot\nof different free tools that you can\n\n207\n00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:30.955\ndownload, basic fuzzing framework,\nnot like my BFF, my best friend forever.\n\n208\n00:11:30.955 --> 00:11:31.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n209\n00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.600\ntry to remember it's not called that on\nthe objective, so don't worry about that.\n\n210\n00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.690\nBut I just wanted to show\nyou guys what this does,\n\n211\n00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.900\nthere are different versions for\ndifferent operating systems.\n\n212\n00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.380\nYou can go ahead and run these tools and\nfuzz your system to check for\n\n213\n00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:51.200\nany kind of applications that fail\nto respond to the appropriate,\n\n214\n00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.780\nbasically you're trying\nto break applications.\n\n215\n00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.730\nThat's what these pieces of software do.\n\n216\n00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.380\nAnd so if they can't respond or\nif they crash or if they respond and\n\n217\n00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.040\ngive information that they shouldn't.\n\n218\n00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:07.230\nAnd so this type of testing can take\na while because you're only testing all\n\n219\n00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.790\nif we look that one machine all\nthe different applications and\n\n220\n00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.470\nthen look at that exponentially\nwithin your environment.\n\n221\n00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:17.610\nBut it's useful to help by identify any\nkind of application vulnerability is here,\n\n222\n00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:19.940\nso that's who we're looking at there.\n\n223\n00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:23.550\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee, specifically when we talk\nabout this side of client side attack,\n\n224\n00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.740\nwhat we're really taking a look at, right,\n\n225\n00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:30.840\nis where the user uses some application\nto connect into a server somewhere.\n\n226\n00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.130\nAnd what are the vulnerabilities there\nthat we're actually taking a look at.\n\n227\n00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.690\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly so if that application\nyou're running these on your client\n\n228\n00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.250\nsystems, like this piece of software\nthat I showed you too to let you\n\n229\n00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.580\nknow to learn if there is any kind of\npoor authentication, implementation,\n\n230\n00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.600\nthings like that.\n\n231\n00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.380\nNow, the objective specifically\ndo call out that client side.\n\n232\n00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.248\nBut you should also test and\n\n233\n00:12:50.248 --> 00:12:55.380\nreally just make sure that your\nserver side is hardened as well.\n\n234\n00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.990\nSo it's kinda strange how they just\nspecifically call it client and\n\n235\n00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:02.750\nnot server, but I wanted to show you its\nuse that you could use anyways there, so.\n\n236\n00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:03.515\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee.\n\n237\n00:13:03.515 --> 00:13:07.180\nProbably the one,\nthis type of attack that's usually\n\n238\n00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.280\ngoing to be mocked,\nnot mocked in the movies,\n\n239\n00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.820\npresented in the movies as going to be\nsome type of password type of attack.\n\n240\n00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.510\nIf there's anything\nthat's been glamorized,\n\n241\n00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:20.760\nthat's the word I was looking for,\nI couldn't remember what it was,\n\n242\n00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.230\nit's going to be this idea\nthat it's very easy to do it.\n\n243\n00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.490\n&gt;&gt; And\nI know exactly what you're talking about,\n\n244\n00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.310\nbecause I'm sitting there watching\nthe movies and thinking the same thing and\n\n245\n00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:28.740\nthey're sitting there, they're\nhacking into these systems and bam,\n\n246\n00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.980\nall of a sudden they're in,\nand you're like wait, what?\n\n247\n00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:31.560\nOkay.\n\n248\n00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.070\nSo there's a problem with that.\n\n249\n00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:34.950\nIt really doesn't happen that fast.\n\n250\n00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:39.160\nSo when we look at password attacks and\nI'll show you guys here in a second.\n\n251\n00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.790\nIt's not a matter of if,\nbut it's a matter of when.\n\n252\n00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:47.120\nAnd that's why when you receive or\nare developing your password policy,\n\n253\n00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.520\nit's really important to incorporate\nthings like your validity period.\n\n254\n00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.620\nLike your expiration dates for\nyour password.\n\n255\n00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.540\nBecause, let's say I go ahead and\ncomplexity.\n\n256\n00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.460\nAnd you'll see, when we take\na look at these types of attacks,\n\n257\n00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:05.040\nwhy all those prerequisites or\nyour policies are so important.\n\n258\n00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.460\nBecause, they really can\nbe exploited that way.\n\n259\n00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.920\nSo let's say it takes awhile, okay?\n\n260\n00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.040\nA couple months for\nme to crack your password.\n\n261\n00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.910\nIf you had a policy in place that stated,\n\n262\n00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.050\nyou need to change your\npassword every 30 days.\n\n263\n00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:21.090\nWell, at that point in time, I'm trying to\ncrack a password that's already changed.\n\n264\n00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:26.460\nSo, that's how were gonna go ahead and\nbe defensive here in this aspect.\n\n265\n00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.670\nSo let's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen and\n\n266\n00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:32.130\nI'll try to shed some light\nwith rainbows and cake here.\n\n267\n00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:33.220\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n268\n00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, on the different\ntypes of attacks that we have.\n\n269\n00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:39.410\nSo first let's go ahead and\ntake a look at Brute Force and\n\n270\n00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.340\nI've just used my name as an example here,\nbut\n\n271\n00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:47.240\nBrute Force attacks are going to\nreally be focusing on utilizing\n\n272\n00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:52.150\nmultiple iterations of every possible,\n&gt;&gt; Combination.\n\n273\n00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.860\n&gt;&gt; Wording, combination, yeah.\n\n274\n00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:58.780\nAnd so here we're trying just first with\nthe uppercase letter, all lowercase,\n\n275\n00:14:58.780 --> 00:14:59.570\nall capital, and\n\n276\n00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:03.540\nthen adding numbers at the end and\nthat's really what they're trying to do.\n\n277\n00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:07.760\nSo, when they hack into those\npasswords in like 30 seconds,\n\n278\n00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.000\nit just doesn't make sense because we\ncouldn't try all these thousands of\n\n279\n00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.330\nwords in that short amount of time here.\n\n280\n00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:18.420\nSo, If we look at dictionary attacks,\nit's a little bit different and so,\n\n281\n00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:22.390\nhopefully I can clear up some confusion\nbecause a lot of these attacks you'll also\n\n282\n00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.850\nsee the term hybrid, and\nit's because we're incorporating\n\n283\n00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:29.800\nmultiple techniques to actually\nfacilitate that one attack.\n\n284\n00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.950\nSo, that's why they're called hybrid here.\n\n285\n00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.840\nAnd dictionary is a little different,\n\n286\n00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.790\nbecause I'm using dictionaries,\nwords that are in the dictionary.\n\n287\n00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:43.280\nBut you also kinda have to think, there\nare also words out there that are not in\n\n288\n00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.165\nWebster's dictionary that might\nstill be utilized in real life.\n\n289\n00:15:47.165 --> 00:15:50.307\nSo we want to look at things like Fido.\n\n290\n00:15:50.307 --> 00:15:55.912\nWe never want to use pets, people's names,\nany kind of relatable content, right?\n\n291\n00:15:55.912 --> 00:16:00.892\nNow, instead of just checking Fido,\nwe can also use different types of\n\n292\n00:16:00.892 --> 00:16:05.623\ndictionaries to check with any kind\nof elite words here where we're\n\n293\n00:16:05.623 --> 00:16:10.281\nincorporating numerical values\nto kinda make it look different.\n\n294\n00:16:10.281 --> 00:16:11.427\nBut, you know what?\n\n295\n00:16:11.427 --> 00:16:13.710\nI know about it, you know about it,\nso do the attackers.\n\n296\n00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.090\nSo let's just try to avoid those\ntypes of words all together and\n\n297\n00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:23.086\nuse our complexity requirements, a mixture\nof uppercase, lowercase, things like that.\n\n298\n00:16:23.086 --> 00:16:24.100\nDon't say hey,\n\n299\n00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.990\nI'm gonna put mochafrappucino as my\nfavorite password because I stop at\n\n300\n00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:32.930\nthe coffee shop and get one every single\nday, not anything that could be guessed.\n\n301\n00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.870\nThat's what you're really trying to\ndo with Dictionary taxes guessing and\n\n302\n00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.920\nmany iterations as well,\njust a little bit different.\n\n303\n00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.280\nThat's the difference between those two.\n\n304\n00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:45.870\nNow, if we look at birthday attacks.\n\n305\n00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:54.400\nSo this concept is, there's a paradox\nthat if there is a roomful of people,\n\n306\n00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.510\neventually, two of those people\nwill share the same birthday.\n\n307\n00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:02.590\nAnd they went ahead and\nattached a numerical value to that.\n\n308\n00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:05.540\nSo how many people do you think it would\ntake, Ronnie, to have the same birthday?\n\n309\n00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.300\nI'm sure you've heard of this before.\n\n310\n00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.909\nBut it's kind of a strange number here.\n\n311\n00:17:08.909 --> 00:17:09.639\n&gt;&gt; 90.\n\n312\n00:17:09.639 --> 00:17:10.286\n&gt;&gt; 90?\n\n313\n00:17:10.286 --> 00:17:11.144\nReally?\n\n314\n00:17:11.144 --> 00:17:11.934\n&gt;&gt; 90.\n\n315\n00:17:11.934 --> 00:17:15.568\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's actually\ngonna be a lot less than that.\n\n316\n00:17:15.568 --> 00:17:16.540\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; 23.\n\n317\n00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:19.274\n&gt;&gt; 23?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it takes on average 23\n\n318\n00:17:19.274 --> 00:17:25.030\nindividuals in a room for two of those\nindividuals to share the same birthday.\n\n319\n00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.840\nSo, it's a numbers game, right?\n\n320\n00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:30.150\nAnd that's where we see these\nbirthday attacks because it really is\n\n321\n00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:34.350\nplaying on the concept of taking a hash.\n\n322\n00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.560\nAnd if you guys recall\nfrom a previous episode,\n\n323\n00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:41.630\nI explained to you what a hash value\nis and what a hash collision is.\n\n324\n00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:45.610\nAnd so, if I can go ahead and\nexploit that hash collision,\n\n325\n00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.810\nthen, I'm looking for\nthat value, that hash value.\n\n326\n00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:54.020\nAnd so that's what I'm trying to obtain\ninstead of actually guessing the password\n\n327\n00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.240\nbecause here's the problem with that.\n\n328\n00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.160\nIf I try to use something\nlike brute force.\n\n329\n00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.980\nAnd I try Cherokee, Cherokee1,\nCherokee2, Cherokee3, well,\n\n330\n00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.320\nwhat could probably happen?\n\n331\n00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.891\nHow many of you guys have forgotten your\npassword and then you see some kind of\n\n332\n00:18:05.891 --> 00:18:07.954\nan error notification saying\nthat you've been locked out?\n\n333\n00:18:07.954 --> 00:18:10.560\nYou need to contact an administrator.\n\n334\n00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.600\nWell, there's a reason for that.\n\n335\n00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.910\nAnd that's because it's a preventative\nmeasure to prevent these types of attacks,\n\n336\n00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.070\nbrute force from occurring.\n\n337\n00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.710\nSo, an attacker knows this as well.\n\n338\n00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:25.750\nSo instead of really focusing in on\nthat end user side, that attacker\n\n339\n00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:30.540\ncould go ahead and shift their efforts to\nthe actual authentication server, right?\n\n340\n00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:35.660\nAnd so they're gonna try to actually\nfind the hash value instead of\n\n341\n00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.970\nthe actual password and input it from the\nclient side, if that makes sense there.\n\n342\n00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:44.597\nSo, lastly we see this\nterm Rainbow Tables here.\n\n343\n00:18:44.597 --> 00:18:52.580\nAnd rainbow tables are going to be\npre-compiled groups of these hash values.\n\n344\n00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:58.030\nBecause if we're just using birthday\nattacks and hash values by themselves,\n\n345\n00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:00.880\nI have to actually perform\nthose computations,\n\n346\n00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:05.568\nthose hashing algorithms which is\ngonna utilize a lot of CPU resources.\n\n347\n00:19:05.568 --> 00:19:08.840\nAnd you know what,\nI might not have the physical hardware and\n\n348\n00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.730\nor, it's kind of like a trade off here.\n\n349\n00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.700\nIt's either gonna take longer or\n\n350\n00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.430\nyou're gonna have to have\nthe hardware to compensate for that.\n\n351\n00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:21.200\nSo a few things that we could do in\nthese type of situations would be to use\n\n352\n00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:26.880\nhashing algorithms with larger bits and\nbit blocks there.\n\n353\n00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.910\nAnd you could also do something that,\n\n354\n00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:33.690\nRonnie kind of made fun of me the other\nday when I said, rinse, wash, and repeat.\n\n355\n00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.040\nAnd what you do is you\ntake that hash value and\n\n356\n00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.520\nyou propend it to the end of the password.\n\n357\n00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.418\nAnd then, you go ahead and\n\n358\n00:19:40.418 --> 00:19:46.297\nconcatenate it with the hash value of\nthe propended password and the hash value.\n\n359\n00:19:46.297 --> 00:19:49.340\nAnd you just kind of add on to it,\nto lengthen that.\n\n360\n00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.230\nYou can also utilize other techniques\nlike key password stretching,\n\n361\n00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.210\nwith our key stretching there.\n\n362\n00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:56.730\nSalting your passwords.\n\n363\n00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:01.670\nA lot of software developers will go\nahead and insert random characters into\n\n364\n00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:06.970\nyour passwords as well, to kind of\nobfuscate the attackers, so confusion.\n\n365\n00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.020\nAnd just to help slow this process down.\n\n366\n00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.880\nBecause like I said, ultimately,\nit's possible to crack a password.\n\n367\n00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.540\nIt's just slowing them\ndown long enough for\n\n368\n00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:19.100\nthat end user to keep\nchanging their password.\n\n369\n00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.500\nSo that's why it's so\nimportant to keep cycling.\n\n370\n00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.170\nWell, maybe not even reusing, and\n\n371\n00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.290\nyou'll also see that policy\nin place at times as well.\n\n372\n00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:30.650\nLike saying, okay, we're not allowed to\nuse the same password that we've used\n\n373\n00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.330\nwithin the past three months\nbecause we don't wanna end up\n\n374\n00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:36.750\ncycling back to a password that the\nattacker might be working on currently.\n\n375\n00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:42.790\nSo rainbow tables are going to be the\npre-compiled lists of those hash values.\n\n376\n00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.700\nSo it kind of takes that\ncomputing out of the equation,\n\n377\n00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:49.540\njust facilitates or\naids in those types of attacks.\n\n378\n00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.800\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee,\nbefore we move on from here,\n\n379\n00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.060\nsomebody in our chat room says,\nhey, on that birthday attack there.\n\n380\n00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.820\nRemember that's it about the day and\n\n381\n00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.842\nthe month of the year that you\nmight have that id [CROSSTALK].\n\n382\n00:21:00.842 --> 00:21:01.967\n&gt;&gt; Very specific, there you go.\n\n383\n00:21:01.967 --> 00:21:05.786\n&gt;&gt; And not particularly the id of the year\nbecause you might actually think it's\n\n384\n00:21:05.786 --> 00:21:07.030\nexactly that same date.\n\n385\n00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.133\nAnd it can be, but\nit doesn't actually mean-\n\n386\n00:21:09.133 --> 00:21:10.382\n&gt;&gt; Not the year.\n\n387\n00:21:10.382 --> 00:21:12.710\n&gt;&gt; At least the majority of the time,\nthe id of the year.\n\n388\n00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.500\nSo as far as just real humans go.\n\n389\n00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:18.159\nNow, the other thing to also realize about\nthe idea of the birthday attack, right?\n\n390\n00:21:18.159 --> 00:21:22.623\nIs that the key here is to understand\nthat the more things that you gather,\n\n391\n00:21:22.623 --> 00:21:27.591\nthe more people you gather together the\nmore likelihood that you're gonna have of\n\n392\n00:21:27.591 --> 00:21:29.900\ncourse, more birthdays that occur.\n\n393\n00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.980\nIn other words, what Cherokee was\npointing out, the idea of collisions.\n\n394\n00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.110\nSo it's not that you have\nto actually limit yourself\n\n395\n00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:39.110\nto 23 pieces of information or\n23 hashes here.\n\n396\n00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:44.650\nWhat you can actually do is gather\na 100 hashes, or 10, a 1000 hashes.\n\n397\n00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:47.540\nAnd essentially what they're saying is\nyou'll end up, what, finding more and\n\n398\n00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.690\nmore collisions,\nis what you'll end up finding.\n\n399\n00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:51.248\nSo as the numbers increase, yes,\n\n400\n00:21:51.248 --> 00:21:54.660\nyou can get more of those\npossibilities that you actually end\n\n401\n00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.160\nup having that type of match which means\nyou can break the password a lot easier.\n\n402\n00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.744\nSo Cherokee,\nthat's a lot of different passwords here.\n\n403\n00:21:59.744 --> 00:22:03.304\nSo attacks, let's make sure that\nyou enumerate them again so\n\n404\n00:22:03.304 --> 00:22:04.950\nthat we get this in our mind.\n\n405\n00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.289\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So the first one was the brute force\n\n406\n00:22:07.289 --> 00:22:08.314\nattack itself.\n\n407\n00:22:08.314 --> 00:22:08.895\n&gt;&gt; Brute force attack.\n\n408\n00:22:08.895 --> 00:22:13.282\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and that is when we're really\ntrying to find any possible combination of\n\n409\n00:22:13.282 --> 00:22:14.850\nthe password itself.\n\n410\n00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:17.650\nAnd Cherokee,\nI don't know if you know this or not.\n\n411\n00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:21.085\nBut this is the only one that's guaranteed\nto work, 100% on time, brute force attack.\n\n412\n00:22:21.085 --> 00:22:22.761\n&gt;&gt; It will work, yes, yes.\n\n413\n00:22:22.761 --> 00:22:24.710\n&gt;&gt; It will absolutely 100% work.\n\n414\n00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.880\nNow it could take a long time.\n\n415\n00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.305\nBut what they're saying is if they go\nthrough every possible combination of\n\n416\n00:22:30.305 --> 00:22:33.100\nwhatever you give them,\none of them is gonna end up matching.\n\n417\n00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.750\nSo, they're not just guessing about this,\nthey're not limited to anything.\n\n418\n00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:38.860\nThey're actually taking a look\nat every single combination.\n\n419\n00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.750\nSo, that is the one that\nis guaranteed to work.\n\n420\n00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:41.671\n&gt;&gt; Dictionary is guessing.\n\n421\n00:22:41.671 --> 00:22:42.171\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n422\n00:22:42.171 --> 00:22:44.481\n&gt;&gt; Dictionary though, is guessing and\n\n423\n00:22:44.481 --> 00:22:47.239\nthat limitation is actually based on well,\n\n424\n00:22:47.239 --> 00:22:48.860\na list of words.\nSo,\n\n425\n00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.864\nas long as that dictionary has\nactually big and gigantic and\n\n426\n00:22:51.864 --> 00:22:55.668\nall comprehensive, you're fine.\nBut if somebody comes out with words and\n\n427\n00:22:55.668 --> 00:22:59.586\nrecently it feels like at least in the\nlast decade or so, we've come up with some\n\n428\n00:22:59.586 --> 00:23:03.222\nweirder and weirder words and that\nhave ended up in the English language-\n\n429\n00:23:03.222 --> 00:23:04.141\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's the truth, yep.\n\n430\n00:23:04.141 --> 00:23:05.541\n&gt;&gt; So as long as you actually have\n\n431\n00:23:05.541 --> 00:23:09.520\na dictionary that's sufficient for what\nyou're going to be doing, you're fine.\n\n432\n00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.543\nBut if the dictionary is small-\n\n433\n00:23:10.543 --> 00:23:11.630\n&gt;&gt; And you guys can find those online.\n\n434\n00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:12.720\n&gt;&gt; If the dictionary is small though,\n\n435\n00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.900\nyou're probably going to end up seeing\nthat, yeah, it's not as comprehensive.\n\n436\n00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.257\nAnd it's more about guessing than\n\n437\n00:23:17.257 --> 00:23:20.370\nensuring the right way too, okay?\nWhat was another one that we were talking\n\n438\n00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:21.212\nabout here?\nWe just talked about-\n\n439\n00:23:21.212 --> 00:23:22.767\n&gt;&gt; We looked at the birthday attacks and\n\n440\n00:23:22.767 --> 00:23:25.690\nthen just saying that rainbow tables\nare those tools that we can use.\n\n441\n00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:26.930\nAnd if you look at my screen,\n\n442\n00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:31.130\nI'll show you guys a couple of resources\nas well, if I pull that up here.\n\n443\n00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:34.494\nSo this is,\n[LAUGH] this has been around for awhile,\n\n444\n00:23:34.494 --> 00:23:37.558\noxid.it here has a tool called Cain and\nAbel.\n\n445\n00:23:37.558 --> 00:23:39.745\nA lot of people just reference it as Cain.\n\n446\n00:23:39.745 --> 00:23:43.200\nIt actually even has\nsniffing capabilities.\n\n447\n00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.280\nAnd I just want to go ahead and\nRonnie threw out his disclaimer before.\n\n448\n00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.560\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nthrow out my disclaimer.\n\n449\n00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.133\nYou guys can practice and use these\ntools on your own networks and devices.\n\n450\n00:23:53.133 --> 00:23:56.330\nBut we're not gonna be using them on\nother people's [LAUGH] property, okay?\n\n451\n00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:58.187\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] without authorization.\n\n452\n00:23:58.187 --> 00:24:00.696\n&gt;&gt; That's correct, without authorization.\n\n453\n00:24:00.696 --> 00:24:05.584\nSo, something you, another cool little\ntool here is, if we go ahead and\n\n454\n00:24:05.584 --> 00:24:08.980\ntype in a password like Fido, right?\n\n455\n00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:13.898\nThis is, what is this, grc.com,\nand it's a password check here.\n\n456\n00:24:13.898 --> 00:24:19.170\nAnd it just kind of makes sure your,\nit gives you an idea of looking at.\n\n457\n00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:23.480\nHere we have different types of online\nattack scenarios, and then it gives you.\n\n458\n00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.530\nSo basically the skill set and\nthe equipment of that type of attacker,\n\n459\n00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.100\nwhat technique,\nlike we just saw they might be using.\n\n460\n00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:37.230\nWhere it could vary from two hours,\nall the way down to 0.0000 for 5 seconds.\n\n461\n00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:40.650\nAnd then when you start incorporating\nthose complexities, the length.\n\n462\n00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:43.840\nAnd we're we're talking about\nthings like rainbow tables,\n\n463\n00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.670\nwhen you're going over 14 characters, they\nreally become ineffective at that point.\n\n464\n00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:55.040\nSo that's why you see some of these really\nlong complexity character minimums there.\n\n465\n00:24:55.040 --> 00:25:00.258\nSo, yeah, and I think that's about it for\npasswords here.\n\n466\n00:25:00.258 --> 00:25:02.343\n&gt;&gt; All right so let's talk about\ncouple of the other ones that you\n\n467\n00:25:02.343 --> 00:25:03.273\nhave left here on our list.\n\n468\n00:25:03.273 --> 00:25:07.078\n&gt;&gt; Okay\n&gt;&gt; One is typosquatting\n\n469\n00:25:07.078 --> 00:25:08.061\n&gt;&gt; Typosquatting\n\n470\n00:25:08.061 --> 00:25:09.382\n&gt;&gt; What in the world is that?\n\n471\n00:25:09.382 --> 00:25:11.170\n&gt;&gt; And so\nI know that is such a weird term.\n\n472\n00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:16.100\nIf we look at my screen, I actually\nwanted to add a couple other terms that\n\n473\n00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:20.860\nare types of typosquatting or\nURL hijacking.\n\n474\n00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:25.450\nSo let's take a look at this first one\nhere, tasting, kinda like sampling, right?\n\n475\n00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:28.860\nThis is where we have\na registration of a domain\n\n476\n00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.860\nto test to see how much traffic it\ngenerates with a five day grace period.\n\n477\n00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.490\nSo I'm actually given five\ndays before I have to pay and\n\n478\n00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:41.540\nauthenticate to that registrar, to see\nif I actually like this domain, right?\n\n479\n00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.820\nSo if the domain is not profitable\nthen registration is never completed.\n\n480\n00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.280\nWell that's nice of them.\n\n481\n00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.480\nBut people are gonna\ntake advantage of that.\n\n482\n00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.310\nSo here we see kiting.\n\n483\n00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:55.420\nThis is where the domain names can be\nregistered up to those five days and\n\n484\n00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.860\nthey're basically just jumping from domain\nname to domain name without ever paying.\n\n485\n00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.920\nSo it's like free advertising there.\n\n486\n00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.730\nNow, hijacking is supplying\nfalse credentials to the actual\n\n487\n00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:11.160\nregistrar when applying for\nthat new domain name.\n\n488\n00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.790\nAnd then cybersquatting is going\nto be acquiring a domain for\n\n489\n00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:18.240\na company's trading name or\ntrademark while there are often\n\n490\n00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.460\nlaws against doing this, companies need\nto be careful to renew domain names.\n\n491\n00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:26.070\nSo what this means is,\nFacebook.com, for example, right?\n\n492\n00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:28.420\nEverybody's heard of that, you know?\n\n493\n00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:33.140\nAnd so what if I go ahead and\nI, Mark Zuckerberg and\n\n494\n00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:37.990\nI forget to renew my domain name for\nFacebook.com and Ronnie swoops in,\n\n495\n00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:42.520\npurchases it and\nnow the face of Facebook is Ronnie Wong.\n\n496\n00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.330\n&gt;&gt; That'd be sad.\n\n497\n00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:44.018\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nNow,\n\n498\n00:26:44.018 --> 00:26:45.986\nI'm sure Mark Zuckerberg\nthought about this and\n\n499\n00:26:45.986 --> 00:26:48.915\nhas a lot of checksums in place to make\nsure that that would never happen.\n\n500\n00:26:48.915 --> 00:26:52.311\nBut if did happen, then he could\nprobably take Ronnie to court and\n\n501\n00:26:52.311 --> 00:26:53.750\nsay no this is my company.\n\n502\n00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:56.520\nIt would be a lengthy process and\neverything.\n\n503\n00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.000\nBut it could happen.\n\n504\n00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.250\nAnd you also see companies out\nthere that will even transpose\n\n505\n00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:05.630\nthe letters in a particular url.\n\n506\n00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:10.385\nMaybe if I spelt it like f-a-c,\nwhat's next to the e, d.\n\n507\n00:27:10.385 --> 00:27:14.460\nB-O-O-K, so you're just transposing for\ntypos and things like that.\n\n508\n00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.740\nYou guys might have even experienced\nthat at home as well, but\n\n509\n00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.870\nthat's what that term means there,\ntyposquatting or URL hijacking.\n\n510\n00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:25.010\n&gt;&gt; All right, the last one that we\nneed to talk about a little bit and\n\n511\n00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:28.990\nI'm not super familiar with this one,\nwatering hole attack.\n\n512\n00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.700\nCherokee, what in the world\nis a watering hole attack?\n\n513\n00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.960\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so if we think about it,\na watering hole, where you're congregating\n\n514\n00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.700\nor where animals like in the Serengeti\nare congregating, right.\n\n515\n00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.515\nSo, where do you congregate?\n\n516\n00:27:41.515 --> 00:27:43.715\nWhat are some sites that you frequent?\n\n517\n00:27:43.715 --> 00:27:48.455\nLet's say someone was really\ntargeting you and your business?\n\n518\n00:27:48.455 --> 00:27:52.885\nBut you really took a lot of steps\nto secure your organization and\n\n519\n00:27:52.885 --> 00:27:56.432\nthey're having a hard time\ndirectly getting to you.\n\n520\n00:27:56.432 --> 00:28:01.562\nSo they can kind of circumvent\nyour security controls by\n\n521\n00:28:01.562 --> 00:28:05.942\ntaking advantage of other\naccounts that you may have.\n\n522\n00:28:05.942 --> 00:28:08.572\nSo actually,\nlet's look at my screen again.\n\n523\n00:28:08.572 --> 00:28:10.952\nThis is a really interesting story.\n\n524\n00:28:10.952 --> 00:28:12.592\nWhat's this guy's name?\n\n525\n00:28:12.592 --> 00:28:15.752\nMat Honan, he's a journalist for\nWired magazine.\n\n526\n00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:21.530\nAnd he actually went through this, this is\nhis picture here, he wrote this article.\n\n527\n00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:24.900\nAnd it's kind of interesting\nto see that he says,\n\n528\n00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.300\nin one hour my entire\ndigital life was destroyed.\n\n529\n00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.970\nThat's how the article starts.\n\n530\n00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:32.880\nAnd it's kind of interesting\nif you read this article, and\n\n531\n00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.700\nI think he even has something\non Netflix you can watch.\n\n532\n00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:40.015\nBut through a, not his direct account.\n\n533\n00:28:40.015 --> 00:28:43.280\nThe objective here was\nhis Twitter account.\n\n534\n00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.860\nSo the attackers wanted to\nhijack his Twitter account, but\n\n535\n00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:48.000\nthey couldn't get direct access.\n\n536\n00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.870\nSo what they had to do,\nlike I said, they circumvented it.\n\n537\n00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.402\nSo a lot of people, ooh,\nwhat was that first one?\n\n538\n00:28:53.402 --> 00:28:55.200\nAmazon is where they started.\n\n539\n00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.210\nA lot of people have Amazon accounts.\n\n540\n00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.140\nSo he actually, the attacker called in.\n\n541\n00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:07.180\nAnd at that point in time, Amazon didn't\nhave a policy in place to prevent someone\n\n542\n00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.730\nfrom adding a credit card to the account\nwithout any kind of authentication.\n\n543\n00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:11.700\nThey were like, yes, pay us.\n\n544\n00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.500\nWe'll take your credit card numbers.\n\n545\n00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.211\nThey have since changed that information,\nI believe.\n\n546\n00:29:16.211 --> 00:29:19.776\nBut when he added that information,\nthe attacker,\n\n547\n00:29:19.776 --> 00:29:25.050\nthey were able to then use the credit\ncard that they had provided to call back.\n\n548\n00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:27.440\nI don't know if it was in\nthe same conversation or not,\n\n549\n00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.640\nbut they were provided\nwith the last four digits.\n\n550\n00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.450\nThey probably used some type of social\nengineering say, is it the old card?\n\n551\n00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:36.150\nI can't remember the last\nfour of the old card.\n\n552\n00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:37.750\nLet me give a new one and update it.\n\n553\n00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.576\nAnd they might have said ending\nin saying the last four numbers.\n\n554\n00:29:40.576 --> 00:29:45.560\nWell it's kind of interesting that\nthe last four digits of that Amazon\n\n555\n00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:50.544\nprovided to the attacker were the same\nfour digits that Apple required\n\n556\n00:29:50.544 --> 00:29:54.375\nto authenticate for\nhis Apple account, okay?\n\n557\n00:29:54.375 --> 00:29:59.340\nSo the attacker jumped\nfrom Amazon to Apple,\n\n558\n00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:03.290\nI think his Google mail and\nthen eventually Twitter, okay?\n\n559\n00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:06.630\nSo it's a very determined\nattacker here but eventually and\n\n560\n00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:11.540\nultimately they got their goal by\nutilizing a watering hole style attack.\n\n561\n00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.180\n&gt;&gt; You know that actually makes sense.\n\n562\n00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.940\nA lot of us tend to reuse things as well.\n\n563\n00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.870\nAnd you can see why somebody's policy,\n\n564\n00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:21.500\nwhatever those different companies were,\nby utilizing one portion of it,\n\n565\n00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:25.345\nit actually allowed them to get around and\nbe able to access other things too.\n\n566\n00:30:25.345 --> 00:30:28.765\nSo all of these different attacks, yes\nyou need to be familiar with them if you\n\n567\n00:30:28.765 --> 00:30:32.105\nare getting ready for\nthe CompTIA Security+ exam.\n\n568\n00:30:32.105 --> 00:30:35.275\nIt's gonna really help you out to make\nsure that you can identify these and\n\n569\n00:30:35.275 --> 00:30:39.055\nunderstand at least the basics of what\nthey are actually going to be set up\n\n570\n00:30:39.055 --> 00:30:41.725\nto do and\nWHY you need to know about them as well.\n\n571\n00:30:41.725 --> 00:30:45.980\nOkay, so Cherokee thank you again for\nhelping us to address all the different\n\n572\n00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:49.900\ntypes of various attacks we are likely\nto actually need to understand.\n\n573\n00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.500\nHopefully you won't encounter every\nsingle one, especially on one day,\n\n574\n00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:57.560\nbut you will hear on\nthe CompTIA Security+ show, I've\n\n575\n00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:01.310\nat least encountered them over a couple of\nepisodes is what you'll also see there.\n\n576\n00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:03.330\nBut, thank you also fo joining us.\n\n577\n00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:06.790\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n578\n00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:12.001\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Brose\n&gt;&gt;

with, and who better to\nhelp us then Ms Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.970\nCherokee, welcome back to our show.\n\n11\n00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.275\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:32.275 --> 00:00:34.470\nYeah, so we got a lot on our plate today.\n\n13\n00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.320\nA lot of story telling because I think\nthat's one of the most effective\n\n14\n00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.000\nways here with social engineering.\n\n15\n00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.960\nWe want you guys just start\nthinking in the mind set of\n\n16\n00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.800\nhow an attacker would think.\n\n17\n00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.520\nAnd that way you're gonna prepare for\nthese types of attacks.\n\n18\n00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.540\nSo, lets go a head and started.\n\n19\n00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.970\nThe first thing on the list we\nhave here is Shoulder Surfing.\n\n20\n00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.300\nSo this particular term,\njust like it sounds,\n\n21\n00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.140\nif someone's just kind of rubber necking\nit, trying to look at your keyboard,\n\n22\n00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.150\nyour key strokes when you're\ntyping in your password or\n\n23\n00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.020\nseeing what's on your screen,\nthat's the term shoulder surfing.\n\n24\n00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.940\nAnd you need to be aware of this if you're\nin any kind of public area working on\n\n25\n00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.570\ndocuments, if you have a laptop, if you're\ntraveling, and they have little screen\n\n26\n00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.530\nprotectors that reduce the viewing angle\nthat'll go ahead and help out with that.\n\n27\n00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.420\nSo that's definitely a term you\nwould want to know for the exam.\n\n28\n00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.630\n&gt;&gt; Now, Cherokee, I've seen this idea\nbefore and I've heard of it happening.\n\n29\n00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.510\nThis is where somebody does\nhave that unusual ability\n\n30\n00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.080\nto simply walk by you while you\nare typing your password and either\n\n31\n00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.720\nby like either hearing the clicks or just\nseeing the password one time typed in,\n\n32\n00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.075\nthat they can actually\nsteal your password, right?\n\n33\n00:01:43.075 --> 00:01:46.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there are people who are actually\ntrained in this kind of thing and\n\n34\n00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.020\nit's kind of crazy.\n\n35\n00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.980\nEven when you look at kind\nof very different techniques\n\n36\n00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.350\nthat have been skilled, trained\nindividuals for these kind of things.\n\n37\n00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.770\nSo something to be aware of.\n\n38\n00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.970\n&gt;&gt; And it is a lot easier today with\nthings like the smartphones and\n\n39\n00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.640\ncell phones as somebody's not\nactually paying attention to\n\n40\n00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.360\nwhat's right there on their screen.\n\n41\n00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.100\nWhat can end up happening is that they\ncan just be right over your shoulder with\n\n42\n00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.880\ntheir phone just kinda turned on,\nthat little record button,\n\n43\n00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.760\nand actually watching you.\n\n44\n00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe don't think anything of it, yeah.\n\n45\n00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.250\nSo definitely be aware of that.\n\n46\n00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.270\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n47\n00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.420\n&gt;&gt; Another term that we see\nhere is dumpster diving.\n\n48\n00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.950\nSo I know it sounds a little strange, but\nI've heard all sorts of articles online\n\n49\n00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.180\nabout even doctors' offices putting\npatient information right into dumpsters.\n\n50\n00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.386\nAnd you know what, if it's out there,\nit's free range, attackers,\n\n51\n00:02:35.386 --> 00:02:38.133\nthere's kind of no shame in the game,\nright.\n\n52\n00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:40.885\nSo if they're available\nto get this information,\n\n53\n00:02:40.885 --> 00:02:43.860\nfree access,\nthey're gonna go ahead and do it.\n\n54\n00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.520\nSo something your company\nmight want to implement.\n\n55\n00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.020\nEspecially, okay, if you're following\nany kind of regulations, guidelines,\n\n56\n00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.580\nlike that doctor's office with HIPAA,\n\n57\n00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.160\nyou're gonna want to keep some\nsort of on site shredding.\n\n58\n00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.810\nSo maybe a locked box where the paper\ncan just be dropped in and then you\n\n59\n00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.350\nhave a company come in weekly, monthly,\nor whatever to shred that information.\n\n60\n00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.160\n&gt;&gt; In terms of different security policies\nas well you'll end up seeing that a lot of\n\n61\n00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.770\ncompanies that do keep sensitive\ninformation, it might also required them\n\n62\n00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.530\nto have a retention policy too before\nthey get rid of the information.\n\n63\n00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.120\nSo a lot of times if there are documents\nlike what Cherokee is mentioning,\n\n64\n00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.073\nyou may have to sanitize a lot of\nthat information or go to a secured,\n\n65\n00:03:24.073 --> 00:03:28.270\nI can't say it,\nsecured shredding type of facility.\n\n66\n00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.260\nOr they may come to you and that way show\nyou that everything's been shredded as\n\n67\n00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.500\nwell before putting it into the dumpster.\n\n68\n00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.400\nEntire companies,\nI know this is gonna sound strange, but\n\n69\n00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.040\nentire companies have actually been\nbuilt off of old equipment that\n\n70\n00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.610\nhas just been put into\nsomebody's dumpster.\n\n71\n00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.010\nSo you end up seeing this happen very\noften, and you might say, how often?\n\n72\n00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.180\nWell some companies do actually have\nwhat they call an end of life policy,\n\n73\n00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.070\nand that means they replace all\ntheir equipment every so often.\n\n74\n00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.360\nI know, for example, the Department\nof Defense here in the States,\n\n75\n00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.320\nthey tend to replace their\nequipment every three years.\n\n76\n00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.920\nSo regardless of whether you or I might\nthink that it's incredibly still useful,\n\n77\n00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.600\nthey say look, every three years\nwe're replacing everything.\n\n78\n00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.080\nAnd so they have to take the time about\nhalfway through that process, about a year\n\n79\n00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.380\nand a half from then, actually starting to\ngo through and starting to think about how\n\n80\n00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.130\nthey retire all of that equipment and\nmake sure that no sensitive data's on it\n\n81\n00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.680\nbefore it actually goes to get\ntrashed a lot of places too.\n\n82\n00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.350\nSo, even though you might think,\nwell why don't they just take\n\n83\n00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.330\nall that great equipment and\ndonate it to a company?\n\n84\n00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.550\nWell, it's actually the regulations\nthey have to follow.\n\n85\n00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.860\nIf there's any sensitive information\nthat can still be found on them,\n\n86\n00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.000\nthey don't want that just\ngoing into a public dumpster.\n\n87\n00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.280\nSo just kinda be aware that you do have\nextra things like that that you have\n\n88\n00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.671\nto worry about,\neven with something like dumpster diving.\n\n89\n00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:54.090\nYep, and we focus a lot on our digital or\nelectronic information, but\n\n90\n00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.960\nyeah, don't even forget about the actual\npaper documents here with dumpster diving.\n\n91\n00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.870\nAnd some companies may even implement\nsomething like a clean desk policy, so\n\n92\n00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.020\nthat you can ensure that there's not\nany kind of sensitive information\n\n93\n00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.225\naround when you're not at\nyour physical work space.\n\n94\n00:05:07.225 --> 00:05:08.928\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Now give us an example of that cuz\n\n95\n00:05:08.928 --> 00:05:12.600\nthat's actually a good thing to talk about\ncuz sometimes people don't understand,\n\n96\n00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.490\nwe use terms.\n\n97\n00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.880\nSo what do we mean by that?\n\n98\n00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've actually had students who\ntold me that their company was completely\n\n99\n00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.490\npaperless, and it was actually for\nan Internet service provider company.\n\n100\n00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.610\nAnd the reason being is that they were\ndealing with credit card information so\n\n101\n00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.140\nmuch on the daily basis\nthat did not wanna have any\n\n102\n00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.452\nphysical remnants of an end\nuser's credit card information.\n\n103\n00:05:34.452 --> 00:05:40.240\nSo everything was electronic and it was\nencrypted and dealt with in that fashion.\n\n104\n00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.538\nThey removed paper from\nthe equation entirely.\n\n105\n00:05:42.538 --> 00:05:47.140\nSo clean desk just means if you\nare going to be leaving your work space,\n\n106\n00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.950\nyou need to put any kind of paperwork\nthat has sensitive information They\n\n107\n00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.110\nmight just say all paperwork so you get in\nthe habit of doing that, in a locked area.\n\n108\n00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.530\nAnd also locking your computer,\nso you would go ahead and\n\n109\n00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.412\nunlock your systems to prevent any kind\nof lunchtime attacks, things like that.\n\n110\n00:06:04.412 --> 00:06:06.280\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, so\nwhat do we have next here?\n\n111\n00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.810\n&gt;&gt; So the next term is tailgating.\n\n112\n00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.970\nAnd I don't know if you Krispy Kreme\nDonuts as much as I do, Ronnie,\n\n113\n00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.150\nbut they're so good.\n\n114\n00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.650\nHave you ever had them?\n\n115\n00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.850\n&gt;&gt; I've had one or\ntwo in my lifetime before.\n\n116\n00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.880\nI'm not going to say how often.\n\n117\n00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.460\n&gt;&gt; So I don't know,\nif we take a poll for our viewers here.\n\n118\n00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.690\nHow many of you actually\nlike Krispy Kreme Donuts?\n\n119\n00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.720\nA lot of people do.\n\n120\n00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.170\nSo let's say I'm coming into a building.\n\n121\n00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.650\nIt's early in the morning, I have\na couple dozen donuts in my hand and\n\n122\n00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.040\nmy purse on my arm.\n\n123\n00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.710\nAnd I'm acting like,\n\n124\n00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.960\nI can't reach in my purse to grab my key\nfop to gain access to this building.\n\n125\n00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.090\nAnd you know what?\n\n126\n00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.590\nMaybe they're aroma of this\nnice hot crispy glaze donuts\n\n127\n00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.380\nhas affected the person in front of me,\nright.\n\n128\n00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.360\nAnd they said it's okay,\nI'll get the door for you.\n\n129\n00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.980\nSo tailgating and piggybacking is when\nan unauthorized, or you know what,\n\n130\n00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.080\nit could even be an authorized user and\nthey're just, they forgot their card.\n\n131\n00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.150\nBut according to your company policy,\nyou should be implementing something\n\n132\n00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.770\nlike saying, look, only one entrance\nper access card or per token.\n\n133\n00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.175\nOr you maybe have a little pin\nnumber that you would go ahead and\n\n134\n00:07:09.175 --> 00:07:11.320\nenter you're not supposed\nto share access that way.\n\n135\n00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.330\nAnd that's good so you can,\nif you are using a system like that\n\n136\n00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.850\nwithin your building, you can keep track\nhow many people are in your building.\n\n137\n00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:25.923\nAnd you hate to think about it, Ronnie,\nbut there's a lot of violence, attacks.\n\n138\n00:07:25.923 --> 00:07:27.458\n&gt;&gt; Correct.\n\n139\n00:07:27.458 --> 00:07:30.020\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so\nif something like that were to happen,\n\n140\n00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.110\nyou would kind of have a good idea of\nwho's in the building, who should be out,\n\n141\n00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.220\nhow many people are actually in there,\neveryone's accounted for.\n\n142\n00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.770\nSo it's just logging and\nkeeping that accountability there as well.\n\n143\n00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.962\n&gt;&gt; Tailgating something that\nyou can take advantage of very\n\n144\n00:07:43.962 --> 00:07:45.897\neasily unintentionally as well.\n\n145\n00:07:45.897 --> 00:07:50.155\nNot only by something like the donuts\nthat Cherokee talked about, but\n\n146\n00:07:50.155 --> 00:07:54.846\nI being an instructor used to also teach\noff-site at a university at times and\n\n147\n00:07:54.846 --> 00:07:58.670\nwhat we'd end up happening is I'd\nbe carrying a box of books And\n\n148\n00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:04.060\nI'd have my laptop on my shoulder bag,\nand I'd have this gigantic box of books.\n\n149\n00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.320\nAnd it would not be any difficulty at all,\n\n150\n00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.100\nespecially if I arrived there about\nthe same time, a lot of people did.\n\n151\n00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.060\nThen what you'd end up seeing is that\nthey would just simply hold the door\n\n152\n00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.430\nopen for me.\n\n153\n00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.870\nAnd even though they knew\nI was private trainer,\n\n154\n00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.090\nthey really had no idea who I was\ncuz they worked in the building and\n\n155\n00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.930\nnot everybody in that building\nwas receiving the training.\n\n156\n00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:28.740\nSo they simply open up a locked door\nusing their particular credentials and\n\n157\n00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.030\nallowed me access in.\n\n158\n00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.590\nAnd they didn't even ask if I\nwas actually there for anything.\n\n159\n00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.680\nAnd right there on the door itself,\ncuz I was reading it,\n\n160\n00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.890\nit said all vendors must report\nto the front desk itself.\n\n161\n00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.780\nYeah, so-\n&gt;&gt; I actually have a very\n\n162\n00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.320\nsimilar situation with that.\n\n163\n00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.261\nI too was teaching at\na university out of state, and\n\n164\n00:08:46.261 --> 00:08:47.674\nI won't say any names here, right.\n\n165\n00:08:47.674 --> 00:08:51.020\nBut there was a door just like that.\n\n166\n00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.780\nAnd in order for\nme to go through a door that was unlocked,\n\n167\n00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.880\nI would have had to of\nwalked an extra block.\n\n168\n00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.110\nSo, [LAUGH] I just sat there and\nwaited for\n\n169\n00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:03.270\nsomeone to come in that entrance and\nask if I could slide in with them.\n\n170\n00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.810\nAnd it happened a couple of times\nwhen I was there that week, so.\n\n171\n00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.991\n&gt;&gt; So Turkey intentionally did that,\nwhereas I didn't.\n\n172\n00:09:08.991 --> 00:09:10.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know.\nI'm telling on myself here.\n\n173\n00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:12.427\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And actually some of my students,\n\n174\n00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:15.054\nI was talking to them about\nthese security concepts.\n\n175\n00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:20.257\nAnd they actually proceeded to\ntell me a story about how their\n\n176\n00:09:20.257 --> 00:09:24.960\nsecurity guards helped carry\nout a concrete planter.\n\n177\n00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.080\nSo someone was actually\nstealing a concrete planter.\n\n178\n00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.860\nAnd they have video footage of\nthe security guards holding the door\n\n179\n00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:30.430\nopen for them.\n\n180\n00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.810\nSo yeah, so maybe they might want to\nrevisit some of their security policies or\n\n181\n00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.460\nenduser training,\nwhich we'll get to which is one\n\n182\n00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.512\nof the best defenses that we\nhave against social engineering.\n\n183\n00:09:40.512 --> 00:09:44.320\nAll right, another concept in social\nengineering here is also going to be\n\n184\n00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.620\nthe concept of impersonation.\n\n185\n00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.620\nSo, Cherokee, are we just talking\nabout voice impersonations?\n\n186\n00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.050\nIs that what we're talking about?\n\n187\n00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.900\n&gt;&gt; Not just, but you could be utilizing\nvoice impersonations, which typically\n\n188\n00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.820\nwould be executed through vishing,\nlike we mentioned in a previous episode.\n\n189\n00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.400\nSo that would be a type of\ntelephone communication where I'm\n\n190\n00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.748\nconcealing my identity for\nthe purpose of this attack.\n\n191\n00:10:05.748 --> 00:10:11.570\nBut you could also legitimately\ndress up as a pizza delivery person.\n\n192\n00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.620\nIt's kind of interesting carriers,\nsome studies have shown,\n\n193\n00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.620\nour very trustable individuals.\n\n194\n00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.220\nSo, if you say like I have a package her\nand I'm delivering it for, yeah, sure,\n\n195\n00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:20.990\njust go ahead.\n\n196\n00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.300\nIt's not a very uncommon thing for\nbusinesses,\n\n197\n00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.920\nthere are a lot of businesses\nreceive packages on a daily basis.\n\n198\n00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:31.080\nSo that's one way to go ahead and\ngain physical access to a building.\n\n199\n00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.530\nAnd a lot of times,\nthe attacker might not even\n\n200\n00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.800\nperform an attack that day as\nthey're impersonating someone.\n\n201\n00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.800\nIt could just be a precursor to try to\nrecon, gain information footprint about\n\n202\n00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.690\nthe actual attack that\nthey will be performing.\n\n203\n00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.670\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is not a very\ncommon technique at all.\n\n204\n00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:53.981\nTo where what you can do is once you get\ninside, you simply you have access inside.\n\n205\n00:10:53.981 --> 00:10:57.992\nAnd as long as you do not have anything\nthat's really stopping you from getting\n\n206\n00:10:57.992 --> 00:11:00.785\naccess, you can walk around\nlike you are a visitor, or\n\n207\n00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:03.070\nthat you actually know what you're doing.\n\n208\n00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.060\nAnd people just assume that you are.\n\n209\n00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.779\nNow I speak about my past experience\nhere which really kind of,\n\n210\n00:11:08.779 --> 00:11:10.824\nnot about impersonation so much.\n\n211\n00:11:10.824 --> 00:11:15.217\nBut I was actually teaching at one\nof our military bases one time, and\n\n212\n00:11:15.217 --> 00:11:18.649\nI was in this building that\nhad no description at all.\n\n213\n00:11:18.649 --> 00:11:23.362\nAnd the first day I was told by\nthe actual security head there\n\n214\n00:11:23.362 --> 00:11:28.390\nthat I am not to be in this\nbuilding without an identity card.\n\n215\n00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:29.230\nI'm not supposed to do that.\n\n216\n00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.620\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nThat's a great idea.\n\n217\n00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.610\n&gt;&gt; So any time that somebody in that\nbuilding was without an identity card,\n\n218\n00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:37.400\neven if they knew you, they were supposed\nto bring you directly to the head of\n\n219\n00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:42.570\nsecurity, or to the security\ndepartment to actually verify or\n\n220\n00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:46.140\nkeep you locked down until they\ncould do what they wanted to.\n\n221\n00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.380\nSo at that point, you have a couple\nof different things that can\n\n222\n00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.420\nreally help stop this\nidea of impersonation.\n\n223\n00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.720\nSomebody steals my own ID that day, well,\n\n224\n00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.450\nthey log in as me, but they don't\nactually put the security badge on.\n\n225\n00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:04.470\nWell now, hopefully everybody's\non duty there that seems to go,\n\n226\n00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:07.020\nall right you're walking\nwithout your security badge.\n\n227\n00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.880\nThey put it on and the picture doesn't\nmatch what's actually supposed to be\n\n228\n00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.140\non there, then they also get taken\nto the security office as well.\n\n229\n00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.215\n&gt;&gt; This isn't Ronnie.\n\n230\n00:12:14.215 --> 00:12:15.140\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this isn't Ronnie.\n\n231\n00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.880\nSo you have those things that\ncan really help defeat it, but\n\n232\n00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.560\nonly if people are aware as well.\n\n233\n00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.070\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n234\n00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:25.510\n&gt;&gt; So you might actually end\nup hearing things like that.\n\n235\n00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.420\nVery easy to do over the phone if\nsomebody's great at voice impersonation.\n\n236\n00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.618\nOr great at actually giving orders,\nand barking orders as well.\n\n237\n00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:36.580\nWhen they walk in and\nsimply pretend to be somebody else,\n\n238\n00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.880\nwhich is very strange because she doesn't\nwork on the basis of fake authority.\n\n239\n00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.260\nThey're acting as if they're authorized.\n\n240\n00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.380\nThey're acting as if they're the boss,\nand most people just say okay yeah,\n\n241\n00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.170\nthat's what he said to do.\n\n242\n00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.630\nAnd that's pretty much it.\n\n243\n00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:52.900\nSo a very strong way to be able\nto get access into places,\n\n244\n00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:57.990\nand maybe even find more information about\nan individual or whatever we want to.\n\n245\n00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:00.600\n&gt;&gt; So actually, James has couple\ngood ideas here in the chat.\n\n246\n00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.450\nPoints that we should kind of note.\n\n247\n00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:07.850\nWhen we were talking about tailgating,\nhe said that's why there are mantraps.\n\n248\n00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.580\nSo, that's a really good idea.\n\n249\n00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.250\nYou can go ahead and implement mantraps.\n\n250\n00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:14.770\nI've seen it in hospitals,\nin banks, and military entities.\n\n251\n00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.720\nA mantrap is essentially going\nto be a door that you enter, and\n\n252\n00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.500\nusually it has either a a clear box or\n\n253\n00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.700\nit might have like a security camera\nwith an operator to go ahead and\n\n254\n00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.230\nonce that, usually they can be configured\na little bit differently, but usually once\n\n255\n00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:33.420\nthat first door has closed behind\nthe individual, the second door will open.\n\n256\n00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.340\nSo it would prevent someone\nsneaking in behind them.\n\n257\n00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:44.100\nAlso another thing to allow just one entry\nwould be something like a turnstile.\n\n258\n00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.020\nSo a turnstile is a circular shaped door.\n\n259\n00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:51.430\nYou see them a lot in like fancy hotels\nin Manhattan, but even in Disneyland,\n\n260\n00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:55.100\nthey have just different\nstyles of turnstiles also.\n\n261\n00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.830\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee,\nlet's talk about hoaxes for a moment.\n\n262\n00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.220\nWhy in the world is this so bad?\n\n263\n00:13:59.220 --> 00:13:59.890\n&gt;&gt; My gosh, I don't know.\n\n264\n00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:04.030\n&gt;&gt; People call up all the time and\njust say, yeah here's something, and\n\n265\n00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.060\neverybody believes it,\nso why is that so bad?\n\n266\n00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so here's the thing.\n\n267\n00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:12.170\nHoaxes are,\nI just don't know how I feel about hoaxes.\n\n268\n00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.670\nI feel like first of all,\n\n269\n00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:19.700\nyou have to understand what\nan attacker's motivation is, okay.\n\n270\n00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:24.710\nSo, hoaxes can be benign, but\nsometimes hoaxes can have\n\n271\n00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:28.580\nindirect effects or direct effects\nfrom just this particular hoax.\n\n272\n00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.990\nSo let me give you an example here.\n\n273\n00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:35.880\nThere is a particular hack, excuse me,\nno not this, not a hacktivist.\n\n274\n00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.074\nLet me see here in my notes, in,\n\n275\n00:14:41.837 --> 00:14:46.610\nThis was 2013 Twitter, okay.\n\n276\n00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:54.200\nIt was the Syrian electronic army\nhad sent hoax emails internally.\n\n277\n00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.600\n&gt;&gt; What they made to look like\ninternally from Twitter, okay.\n\n278\n00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.072\nReferencing the actual quote,\nthe headline here that day,\n\n279\n00:15:01.072 --> 00:15:02.290\nthe email that they had sent.\n\n280\n00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:07.980\nIt said, breaking, two explosions in the\nWhite House, and Barack Obama is injured.\n\n281\n00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.560\nSo the Associated Press went ahead and\n\n282\n00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.340\nreleased this information\non their Twitter account.\n\n283\n00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:18.570\nThis was at 1:07 PM, and by 1:10 PM.\n\n284\n00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.252\nDoes it say how many points?\n\n285\n00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:20.995\nNo.\n\n286\n00:15:20.995 --> 00:15:23.860\nThe DOW just started to nosedive.\n\n287\n00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.960\nAnd it wasn't until just\na few moments thereafter\n\n288\n00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.710\nthat people were able to tell\nthat this was just a hoax.\n\n289\n00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:34.010\nBut that was an immediate,\ndirect result of a hoax.\n\n290\n00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.150\nSeeing the stock market crash there.\n\n291\n00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:39.610\nSo maybe that was the motivation\nof the hacktivist group.\n\n292\n00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:43.315\nYou kind of, not everyone, you're not\ngoing to always be able to understand\n\n293\n00:15:43.315 --> 00:15:47.134\nthe motivation of an attacker, but\nsometimes it'll help you understand why,\n\n294\n00:15:47.134 --> 00:15:50.559\nand then that could even help in\nimplementing your security controls.\n\n295\n00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:53.188\nYeah, there's no doubt in today's world of\n\n296\n00:15:53.188 --> 00:15:56.169\nsocial media that hoaxes\ncan carry a very long way.\n\n297\n00:15:56.169 --> 00:15:58.967\nAnd this is the very problem\nthat you have with social media.\n\n298\n00:15:58.967 --> 00:16:02.946\nSomebody can go ahead and\nmake their own blog look exactly like\n\n299\n00:16:02.946 --> 00:16:07.921\na legitimate news organization and\npost as if everything is actually real and\n\n300\n00:16:07.921 --> 00:16:11.530\nthere may not be a word of\ntruth behind it as well.\n\n301\n00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.070\nSo you can get this, and\n\n302\n00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:17.420\nit's not necessarily I agree with\nthe idea of having to vet everything.\n\n303\n00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:21.740\nBut you do need some information where\nwhen you hear it and you're going like,\n\n304\n00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:25.810\nI don't remember hearing that anywhere\nelse, usually just a quick search\n\n305\n00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:28.770\nusing your favorite search\nengine will at least validate.\n\n306\n00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:32.270\nOr if nobody else has it, you'll find\nout within a few minutes whether or\n\n307\n00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.360\nnot something like that has happened.\n\n308\n00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:38.550\nSo don't always believe the very first\nthing you read is pretty much my key here,\n\n309\n00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:42.940\nespecially when it comes down to\nunusual information that comes along.\n\n310\n00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.310\nAnd hoaxes,\nthey don't have to actually start off big.\n\n311\n00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:48.396\nThey're always fairly small, and\nthen of course with social media,\n\n312\n00:16:48.396 --> 00:16:51.795\nthey end up going what they call viral,\nand that's the problem that we have,\n\n313\n00:16:51.795 --> 00:16:52.913\nwith the idea of hoaxes.\n\n314\n00:16:52.913 --> 00:16:57.387\n&gt;&gt; And because we have such accessibility,\nthis is kind of an interesting thing,\n\n315\n00:16:57.387 --> 00:17:00.724\nbecause let's say Ronnie,\nI made a claim on Facebook, and\n\n316\n00:17:00.724 --> 00:17:03.520\nI just totally bashed you online.\n\n317\n00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.960\nAnd if it went viral, I could completely\nruin your reputation without any kind of\n\n318\n00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.240\nfactual evidence and regardless,\n\n319\n00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.080\nI mean a lot of you guys watching this\nprobably are fact checkers, okay.\n\n320\n00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.590\nYou wanna go ahead and check the facts\nbefore you believe something.\n\n321\n00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:18.560\nThere are a lot of people out there,\nthey see an article,\n\n322\n00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.140\nthey see it, they believe it.\n\n323\n00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.890\nAnd at that point, the damage is done.\n\n324\n00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:26.150\nRonnie's now fired, and\nhe's not able to be employed elsewhere,\n\n325\n00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:29.000\nbecause of all these horrible,\nfalse things I said about him.\n\n326\n00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.280\nSo, we really need to be\naware of that as well.\n\n327\n00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you really have to understand\nsomething in today's age of,\n\n328\n00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:36.440\nespecially with the idea of hoax, right.\n\n329\n00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.190\nIt's the way that they are able to\nget around things because there's not\n\n330\n00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:44.380\na governing law or body behind a lot\nof things that are being said.\n\n331\n00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.655\nSo unlike where newspapers might print\nsomething and it's libel or slander,\n\n332\n00:17:47.655 --> 00:17:51.600\nI can't remember which one is which, I\nthink that when you print it, it's libel.\n\n333\n00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.450\nWell on social media,\nthere's no idea of necessarily libel,\n\n334\n00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.700\nbecause it was actually printed that way.\n\n335\n00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.880\nI mean, so that's where the problems\nalso come in, especially if\n\n336\n00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.930\nyou're trying to ruin someone's reputation\nby doing something this way, okay?\n\n337\n00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:07.670\nSo let's also talk about a couple terms.\n\n338\n00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:11.085\nI know that we've mentioned them in\nanother episode before, whaling and\n\n339\n00:18:11.085 --> 00:18:12.020\nphishing again.\n\n340\n00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.795\nBut they are on this\nparticular exam objective, so\n\n341\n00:18:13.795 --> 00:18:15.125\nlet's make sure we cover them again.\n\n342\n00:18:15.125 --> 00:18:19.444\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so remember, whaling is going\nto be where I'm really targeting\n\n343\n00:18:19.444 --> 00:18:24.083\na particular individual perhaps,\nusually it's for higher affluency.\n\n344\n00:18:24.083 --> 00:18:28.661\nIf they have a high net worth, then I'm\ngonna try to get more of a return on\n\n345\n00:18:28.661 --> 00:18:31.532\ninvestment, ROI for my particular attack.\n\n346\n00:18:31.532 --> 00:18:35.275\nSo when I'm really targeting someone of\nwealth there, that's the term whaling,\n\n347\n00:18:35.275 --> 00:18:36.460\nit's a targeted attack.\n\n348\n00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:41.740\nAnd so why do these attacks work?\n\n349\n00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.680\nWell if they didn't work,\n\n350\n00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.540\npeople wouldn't do them and\nit could be something very simple, okay.\n\n351\n00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.452\nHaving someone, and this kind of example\nis something if you're working in IT,\n\n352\n00:18:50.452 --> 00:18:54.016\nmaybe you work for a call center,\nhelp desk, you have to be really aware of\n\n353\n00:18:54.016 --> 00:18:57.830\nindividuals calling in forgetting their\npasswords, wanting to reset them.\n\n354\n00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:01.483\nPerhaps your company has policies in\nplace, where you call them back at their\n\n355\n00:19:01.483 --> 00:19:04.136\ndesk extension or\nwhatever your company policy may be.\n\n356\n00:19:04.136 --> 00:19:08.468\nAnd I know it sounds little obvious or\nsilly even, but\n\n357\n00:19:08.468 --> 00:19:13.030\nI mentioned this in previous\nepisode in 2016 even.\n\n358\n00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.940\nOkay, it was the Department of Justice,\n\n359\n00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:20.860\na help desk technician had granted\nunfettered access to an attacker.\n\n360\n00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.391\nAnd this was from the Palestinian\nhacktavist group,\n\n361\n00:19:24.391 --> 00:19:30.280\nthey called themselves the Dot Gov's and\nthey claimed this particular attack.\n\n362\n00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:37.130\nAnd that attacker had access to terabytes\nworth of confidential information there,\n\n363\n00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:40.520\nand they actually took that information,\npublished it online.\n\n364\n00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:45.742\nIt had something,\n20,000 FBI and 9,000 Department\n\n365\n00:19:45.742 --> 00:19:50.199\nof Homeland Security employee\ncontact information.\n\n366\n00:19:50.199 --> 00:19:54.100\nSo once that information's out there,\nthere is no retraction and\n\n367\n00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.500\nit's pretty serious.\n\n368\n00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.445\nSo, social engineering, and that was 2016.\n\n369\n00:19:59.445 --> 00:20:02.483\nI mean, it's not something\nthat's going away anytime soon.\n\n370\n00:20:02.483 --> 00:20:04.110\nWe have to be aware of these.\n\n371\n00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:07.180\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the advantage of doing this,\nand its effectiveness,\n\n372\n00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:11.290\nright, boils down to several different\nthings that we have available to us, and\n\n373\n00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.220\nCherokee's gonna help us understand those.\n\n374\n00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.740\nBut the neat thing about social\nengineering is really it doesn't require\n\n375\n00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:20.080\nany real technology for it to also work.\n\n376\n00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.920\nEven though a lot of people do use\nthings like social engineering, or\n\n377\n00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.610\neven the phone, a lot of times it's\njust as simple as actually being\n\n378\n00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:30.750\nnice to someone, and you can actually\nget by a bit more than you realized.\n\n379\n00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:31.994\n&gt;&gt; Guess and you know what,\n\n380\n00:20:31.994 --> 00:20:36.550\nand just by being nice to someone\npotentially about 30 million bucks here.\n\n381\n00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:39.340\nAnd let me explain, maybe a little\nbit of chocolate along the way.\n\n382\n00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:44.730\nThat's what happened in this particular\ncase, in 2007 there was a bank robbery in,\n\n383\n00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.620\nlet's see,\nit was ABN AMRO Bank in Belgium.\n\n384\n00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:53.200\nSo the attacker utilized\nsocial engineering,\n\n385\n00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.102\nno other techniques, weapons,\ntechnology, that was it.\n\n386\n00:20:57.102 --> 00:20:59.952\nHe actually did bring in\nchocolate to the employees, so\n\n387\n00:20:59.952 --> 00:21:01.476\nhe was able to gain a rapport.\n\n388\n00:21:01.476 --> 00:21:05.621\nAnd that's the thing is they're really\ntrying to connect with their victim here.\n\n389\n00:21:05.621 --> 00:21:10.440\nCharm, okay, things like that are really\ngonna get you far with social engineering.\n\n390\n00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:15.510\nAnd during normal business hours, he\nliterally, and this attacker is still at\n\n391\n00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:20.120\nlarge, walked out of the bank with\n120,000 carats worth of diamonds.\n\n392\n00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.720\nSo yeah, that's pretty bad.\n\n393\n00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.183\nSo let's see, what else do we have here?\n\n394\n00:21:26.183 --> 00:21:29.334\nTarget, 2013, you guys probably remember.\n\n395\n00:21:29.334 --> 00:21:34.552\n40 million credit card and\ndebit card user information was released,\n\n396\n00:21:34.552 --> 00:21:39.085\nand investigators attribute this\nattack to a sub contractor,\n\n397\n00:21:39.085 --> 00:21:42.790\nan HVAC system called\nFazio Mechanical Services.\n\n398\n00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:47.270\nThey say that that particular\ncompany utilized the Citadel trojan\n\n399\n00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:50.480\nin an email communication to go ahead and\ninitiate that attack.\n\n400\n00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:55.890\nSo afterwards, we started seeing the chips\nbeing put on our debit cards and credit\n\n401\n00:21:55.890 --> 00:22:01.090\ncards to try to help, because it was such\nan eye-opener for individuals to say, wow.\n\n402\n00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:04.900\nAn attack of this size,\nthis magnitude to be able to happen.\n\n403\n00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.110\nSo why does it work?\n\n404\n00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:10.549\nWe see terms like authority.\n\n405\n00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:14.660\nLike I said, really finding that\nconnection with your victim is key here,\n\n406\n00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:19.050\nbecause I'm sure all of us have been under\nsome kind of time constraint before.\n\n407\n00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.790\nHaving a boss say this project needs\nto be done by 2 PM or you're fired.\n\n408\n00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:27.725\nSo if I can take a common experience and\nuse that as part of my scenario or\n\n409\n00:22:27.725 --> 00:22:32.912\nmy back story, a lot of people will kind\nof feel sorry and play into that and\n\n410\n00:22:32.912 --> 00:22:37.698\nsay okay, I'll help you out,\nI'll give you access this one time.\n\n411\n00:22:37.698 --> 00:22:41.660\nOkay, like the help desk technician or\nsomething like that.\n\n412\n00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:47.480\nSo authority, intimidation,\nconsensus or social proof,\n\n413\n00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.360\nscarcity, this is a limited time kind\nof offer, you only get one shot, or\n\n414\n00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.630\nwe're about to close your account if\nyou don't verify your credentials.\n\n415\n00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.390\nFamiliarity and liking, so if they\nget to know you say, Joe the janitor,\n\n416\n00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:01.150\nhe is so nice.\n\n417\n00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:02.610\nHe's been here for five years.\n\n418\n00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:05.620\nWell, you know what, maybe he's been\nplanning this attack for five years,\n\n419\n00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.130\nmaybe ten years, who knows?\n\n420\n00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:10.390\nAnd trust, just gaining that trust.\n\n421\n00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:14.860\nSo [COUGH] Something I did want\nto show you also, let's see,\n\n422\n00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:18.230\nif there was a particular, I thought\nthis was pretty interesting here.\n\n423\n00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.640\nIf we look at my screen, who is this?\n\n424\n00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:25.107\nUltrascan Advanced Global Investigations\ndid some research, and\n\n425\n00:23:25.107 --> 00:23:28.725\nthe statistics here are just\nkind of mind-boggling.\n\n426\n00:23:28.725 --> 00:23:31.703\nWe'll put this link in the file share, but\n\n427\n00:23:31.703 --> 00:23:34.862\nthere's a lot of great\ninformation in here.\n\n428\n00:23:34.862 --> 00:23:38.450\nAnd it says even that it's\nnot always the uneducated or\n\n429\n00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:43.372\nthe poverty stricken that are more\nsusceptible to these types of attacks.\n\n430\n00:23:43.372 --> 00:23:47.977\nThey're actually questioning their own\njudgment a lot more so than someone who\n\n431\n00:23:47.977 --> 00:23:51.895\nmaybe is a little more Egotistical or\neducated so they feel like they\n\n432\n00:23:51.895 --> 00:23:56.740\nhave the skill set to be able to respond\naccordingly, especially even doctors.\n\n433\n00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:01.410\nThe statistics for doctors are rather\nintriguing because they kind of,\n\n434\n00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:07.420\nlooking at it from\na different perspective,\n\n435\n00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:14.200\nand we see the in kind of trauma or\nsituation where they wanna help people.\n\n436\n00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.740\nSo they just kind of have like\nan innate urge to help people.\n\n437\n00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:23.400\nIt's a very, it's an interesting document\nhere, a lot of the statistics as well.\n\n438\n00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.220\nI'm sure you guys have heard, or\n\n439\n00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:30.710\nsomeone that you know of\nreceive a Nigerian email, okay.\n\n440\n00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:34.760\nYou're related to a long lost and your\ndistant relative is a Nigerian prince or\n\n441\n00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.560\nsomething like that.\n\n442\n00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.370\nAnd the statistics are just\ncompletely overwhelming,\n\n443\n00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:41.890\nabout 95% depending on check fraud.\n\n444\n00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.540\nI think it's like 80%\ngenerally from Nigeria.\n\n445\n00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.650\nI myself have been\na victim of check fraud.\n\n446\n00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:49.420\nActually that was over a decade ago, and\n\n447\n00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:54.250\nit was one of the many reasons what\nactually prompted me to go into IT.\n\n448\n00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.670\nAnd I'll try to be brief here,\nit was a long drawn out story, but\n\n449\n00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:04.420\nessentially the local jurisdiction for\n\n450\n00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:08.460\nthe police department whenever I had to\ncalled to make a report of this incident,\n\n451\n00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.590\nthey just said great, thank you,\nwe'll take note of that.\n\n452\n00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.990\nAnd I'm just like what that's it.\n\n453\n00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:14.200\nThey're like, yeah that's it.\n\n454\n00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.660\nAnd I said well why aren't you\nguys investing the situation and\n\n455\n00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.830\nthey said well frankly it's\nout of our jurisdiction,\n\n456\n00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.850\nand we don't have the man power for\nthat kind of thing.\n\n457\n00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:25.270\nThey said you know what, if you find and\nagain, this was over ten years ago so\n\n458\n00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:26.910\nI don't know what\nthe requirements are now,\n\n459\n00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:30.310\nbut they said if you find\nother victims and the loss\n\n460\n00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:36.530\ncumulatively is over $40,000 we can assign\nyou an FBI detective, and I said great.\n\n461\n00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:40.680\nSo, I did my own investigative\nresearch online.\n\n462\n00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.360\nAnd I did, I found victims, and\nthe loss was in fact over $40,000 worth.\n\n463\n00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.330\nSo we got assigned an FBI, a detective.\n\n464\n00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:47.970\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n465\n00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:51.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nI thought we're really gonna go somewhere,\n\n466\n00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.380\nand we had pooled all of the victims.\n\n467\n00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:54.830\nWe started,\nI got all of their phone numbers.\n\n468\n00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.060\nWe were talking and\nemailing back and forth.\n\n469\n00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:01.990\nWe gotta a good little pile of\ninformation to go off of and\n\n470\n00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:03.820\nI thought, we're gonna catch this guy.\n\n471\n00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.940\nI give the information\nto the FBI detective and\n\n472\n00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.867\nhe basically just said thanks,\nwe'll go ahead and file that for you and\n\n473\n00:26:08.867 --> 00:26:14.200\nI guess $40,000 in the grand scheme\nof things is just a drop in the hat.\n\n474\n00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.930\nBut to me it was a lot.\n\n475\n00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.650\nAnd I felt like you know what.\n\n476\n00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:19.460\nThese attacks are happening.\n\n477\n00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:20.930\nThey're successful.\n\n478\n00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:22.150\nWhy are they gonna stop?\n\n479\n00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.060\nSo there's obviously a need for\nthis industry.\n\n480\n00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:28.280\nAnd you see all sorts of companies, even\nthe government, offering a lot of grants,\n\n481\n00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.910\na lot of education to\nhelp bring this field up.\n\n482\n00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:35.560\nBecause we're really seeing a deficit\nwith security individuals right now.\n\n483\n00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.880\nSo you guys are definitely in the right\nplace watching these videos here.\n\n484\n00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.110\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee,\n\n485\n00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:42.450\nwith the effectiveness of everything\nthat we've talked about so far.\n\n486\n00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:45.470\nThese don't sound like,\nthat they're really that dangerous.\n\n487\n00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:48.680\nBut we've not heard stories about\nhow dangerous they really can be.\n\n488\n00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.890\nThe cost associated with them.\n\n489\n00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:54.420\nWe need to also talk about then,\nwhat can we do about it?\n\n490\n00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:58.020\nWhat is it, what's the main\ntools that we can set in place?\n\n491\n00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.690\nCuz it doesn't seem like\nanything that you have,\n\n492\n00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:01.281\nthere's really a software patch for it.\n\n493\n00:27:01.281 --> 00:27:02.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know.\n\n494\n00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:06.150\nAnd when we look at examples\nwith the diamonds, okay.\n\n495\n00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.550\nThere wasn't any kind of technology used.\n\n496\n00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:12.100\nSo, we really have to talk\nabout that human interaction.\n\n497\n00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.040\nWe really need to educate our end users.\n\n498\n00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.630\nWe really need to leverage our employees,\nuse them.\n\n499\n00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:20.140\nLike that situation you gave where\n\n500\n00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:23.930\nif we train our employees to be able to\nidentify if they're not wearing a badge,\n\n501\n00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:27.120\nthey're not standing there with an escort,\nsomething is wrong.\n\n502\n00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.860\nSomething is defying your policy there.\n\n503\n00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:34.670\nSo really just, also if you're\nin that kind of environment,\n\n504\n00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:36.760\ncapitalize on those teachable moments.\n\n505\n00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:41.160\nIf you see someone standing there\nwithout a badge on, say hey, and\n\n506\n00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.320\nsay look I noticed you\ndidn't raise the red flag or\n\n507\n00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.760\ncause any kind of alarm just\nbe a little more aware.\n\n508\n00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:51.340\nYou don't want to,\na lot of people are a little afraid\n\n509\n00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:55.130\nadhere to these policies because we're\nin this mindset of customer service.\n\n510\n00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:59.270\nWe have to make everyone happy all\nthe time but from a security standpoint\n\n511\n00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:03.040\nYou know, you really do have to\nsometimes just be the one to say,\n\n512\n00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.880\nlook this is the rule,\nthis is how it's gonna be.\n\n513\n00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.970\nAnd, let me show you\nsomething on my screen here.\n\n514\n00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:09.910\nI thought that this was pretty cool.\n\n515\n00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:12.170\nThis is a website called SecurityIQ.\n\n516\n00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:15.950\nYou can actually hire companies or perform\nyour own kind of tests or checksums for\n\n517\n00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:17.430\nyour employees as well.\n\n518\n00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:21.450\nThis one I just put my email address in,\nand they essentially sent me a phishing\n\n519\n00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:25.960\nemail, and you can try this in your\nenvironment and send it to your employees.\n\n520\n00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.640\nSee how many of them click\non these phishing links.\n\n521\n00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.820\nSo this is actually, let's see here,\nwhat did that email look like.\n\n522\n00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:37.380\nOops, all right, so it came through.\n\n523\n00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.740\nAnd it's in some other language here.\n\n524\n00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.860\nI'm not sure what they're saying.\n\n525\n00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.340\nBut that logo looks recognizable, Xerox.\n\n526\n00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:45.630\nWe all know Xerox.\n\n527\n00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:51.220\nAnd then look they even go ahead and note\nmy particular email address right here,\n\n528\n00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.150\nso they must be trying to contact me.\n\n529\n00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:54.500\nThere's a little hyperlink.\n\n530\n00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.430\nGo ahead and click it, and then you can\ngo ahead and measure how many individuals\n\n531\n00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:02.720\nwithin your department would be\nsusceptible to something like that.\n\n532\n00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.540\nSo this is just a test, but\nyou can do little tests and\n\n533\n00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.710\ntraining for your employees\nto just raise that awareness.\n\n534\n00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:13.670\nThat's gonna be your number one\ndefense with social engineering.\n\n535\n00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:18.100\nAnd the hard part is most people don't\nspot this idea of social engineering, and\n\n536\n00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:22.210\nthe reason why is because they're not told\nthat they need to be looking out for this.\n\n537\n00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:25.210\nSo certain things that can normally\nhelp in those situations in terms of\n\n538\n00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:26.380\nuser awareness,\n\n539\n00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:31.040\nis to tell them some things that they're\nnot supposed to actually reveal as well.\n\n540\n00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.090\nSo you normally, even though you might\ndescribe your job, describe it in the most\n\n541\n00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:39.030\ngeneral terms, don't even talk about\nspecifics on everything that you do\n\n542\n00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:43.510\neveryday, especially if you're\ndealing with proprietary information.\n\n543\n00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.510\nYou may actually tell you\nlike where you work, but\n\n544\n00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:48.890\nyou may not wanna tell them\nexactly where you work as well.\n\n545\n00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:52.030\nYou may wanna be able to\njust give the most generic\n\n546\n00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:53.970\ntypes of responses that you can.\n\n547\n00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:57.480\nThe easiest thing of course is to also\ntake a look, and make sure that they're\n\n548\n00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.330\nnot mentioning something on social media,\nthat they're not supposed to.\n\n549\n00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:05.020\nIn this day in age,\nyou've gotta realize that people like to\n\n550\n00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:10.310\ncomplain on social media, especially\nthings that are going on at work.\n\n551\n00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:13.040\nAnd you might find yourself\nin a position which\n\n552\n00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.270\naccording to the way that your\nHR department handles it.\n\n553\n00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:19.650\nThat they also monitor\nthe social media types of\n\n554\n00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.850\naccess that they\nare normally doing as well.\n\n555\n00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:26.530\nSo all of these are actually very\nimportant in the way that you\n\n556\n00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:28.900\ntrain your users to understand this.\n\n557\n00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.800\nAt a hospital recently I\nwas visiting a friend, and\n\n558\n00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.390\nI noticed the way that they were\ntraining people for social engineering.\n\n559\n00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:41.130\nThat when they actually entered in\ninformation on their screen savers,\n\n560\n00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.540\non the little terminal\nthat they had access to,\n\n561\n00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:49.120\nall it was pretty much about how to\nidentify social engineering attacks,\n\n562\n00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:54.300\nlike make sure that if you're\nin the room with a patient, and\n\n563\n00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.800\nyou're not sure who the visitor is,\nask them their name.\n\n564\n00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.970\nAnd what, who they are.\n\n565\n00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:01.600\nMake sure you note that.\n\n566\n00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.130\nThose are some of\nthe things that you have.\n\n567\n00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:06.820\nOkay?\nAre they visiting at strange or off hours?\n\n568\n00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:07.960\nMake sure you know that.\n\n569\n00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.880\nSo that it's actually\non every single screen,\n\n570\n00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.440\nso that nobody has a chance to miss,\nand say\n\n571\n00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.500\nwell I didn't know that that was something\nI was supposed to be watching for.\n\n572\n00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:18.190\nSo there is different ways we\ncan get the information to them.\n\n573\n00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:21.320\nThe key is making sure that it does get\nout and making sure it's understandable.\n\n574\n00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.170\nSo you may offer training in that.\n\n575\n00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:28.270\nBut the other thing of course is again,\nmonitoring is also the helpful thing too.\n\n576\n00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:32.770\nSo Cherokee, any last words here on social\nengineering that we need to worry about?\n\n577\n00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:35.610\n&gt;&gt; It's out there,\nIt's real don't under estimated it,\n\n578\n00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:38.430\nyou'll know you can go ahead implement\nall your technical controls and\n\n579\n00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:44.125\nall it takes a box of chocolates,\nso just be were is that, [LAUGH].\n\n580\n00:31:44.125 --> 00:31:46.090\n&gt;&gt; All right so, on this episode\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n581\n00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:47.170\n&gt;&gt; Remember what you've take and\n\n582\n00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:50.650\nlook at here right, cuz Cherokee and\nI will talk about something different\n\n583\n00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:52.650\ntypes of social internet\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n584\n00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:55.920\nthen Cherokee's also told us some of\nthe different stories that actually have\n\n585\n00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:58.760\nhappened, where you can go and\nactually see them yourselves.\n\n586\n00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:02.340\nWe've gotta remember that all\nthat comes down to one key factor\n\n587\n00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:05.070\nwhich is effectiveness itself and\n\n588\n00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:09.010\nhow we actually break through that\neffectiveness by using end user awareness.\n\n589\n00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:12.500\nTo help ensure that everybody\nunderstands what's happening there too\n\n590\n00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:16.360\nbecause this is kind of growing bigger and\nbigger each and every day.\n\n591\n00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.190\nAs more and more people begin to accept\neverything that they see and read online,\n\n592\n00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:24.510\nit's going to become even more\neffective in everything that it does.\n\n593\n00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:27.570\nWell that's a great place for\nus to also end this episode then.\n\n594\n00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.930\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n595\n00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:31.970\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n596\n00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:35.604\n&gt;&gt; Stay right here for\nmore CompTIA Security+.\n\n597\n00:32:35.604 --> 00:32:41.653\n[MUSIC]\n\n598\n00:32:41.653 --> 00:32:42.600\n&gt;&gt; Thank

right.\n\n5\n00:00:33,763 --> 00:00:36,257\nGood morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening, and\n\n6\n00:00:36,257 --> 00:00:40,480\nwelcome back to another episode of\n\"ITProTV\", I'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,630\nBack to you on Mr. Nate Copeland.\n\n8\n00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,330\nHow's it going Nate?\n\n9\n00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,050\n>> Yeah, pretty good,\nDon, pretty good today.\n\n10\n00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,980\nFired up for yet\nanother fun show of Security+ with you.\n\n11\n00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,420\n>> Well,\nyou know it's gonna be over the

00:01:08,586\nand we're going to be taking a look\nat some very technical stuff, but\n\n18\n00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:12,741\nthe way that CompTIA addresses\nit is very nontechnical.\n\n19\n00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:14,480\nSo they kind of go a little high level.\n\n20\n00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,265\nI like to go a little\nmore hands on with it.\n\n21\n00:01:16,265 --> 00:01:20,920\nBut we're going to look at vulnerability,\nand penetration testing for\n\n22\n00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,340\nsystems, all right?\n\n23\n00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,960\nSo, what do we mean when we say that?\n\n24\n00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,250\nLets just start off real high level.\n\n25\n00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:33,290\nSo, when we talk about\nvulnerability scanning,\n\n26\n00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:37,090\nwhatever you want to call it, and\npenetration testing, what are those?\n\n27\n00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,000\nSo, let's just start there, and\nwe'll go into kind of how you go about it,\n\n28\n00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,700\nand what the process really involves.\n\n29\n00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,580\nSo, when we talk about vulnerabilities,\nand\n\n30\n00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,080\nwhen we talk about penetration testing,\n\n31\n00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,450\nwhat we're really talking about is how are\nthe attackers gonna come at you, right?\n\n32\n00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,660\nEvery network has an attack surface.\n\n33\n00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,040\nIf you're connected to the Internet,\nthere has to be at least one way for\n\n34\n00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,070\npeople to be able to get to you, even if\nit is through somebody on the inside.\n\n35\n00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,160\nSo attackers are gonna be\nlooking at whatever they can do,\n\n36\n00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,610\nwhatever ways they can find to get\ntheir fingers into your network, and\n\n37\n00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,850\nfrom there to expand their access.\n\n38\n00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,540\nSo, it's up to us to stop that, right?\n\n39\n00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,590\nVulnerability scanning is one\nof the best ways to do that.\n\n40\n00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,070\nThat's when we take a look\nat our servers and we say,\n\n41\n00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,640\nokay, what possible\nvulnerabilities do I have?\n\n42\n00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,700\nWhat are the ways\nan attacker could get in?\n\n43\n00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,420\nAnd you take a look at\nwhat services you run,\n\n44\n00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,700\nwhat machines are exposed to the Internet,\nwhat machines aren't, what ports are open,\n\n45\n00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,680\nall the different configuration\nthings across your systems.\n\n46\n00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,910\nAnd you look at what you're doing, at\nwhat you're leaving open to an attacker.\n\n47\n00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,700\nNow, finding that information for\nus, like when we scan for\n\n48\n00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,020\nvulnerabilities, we're inside the network.\n\n49\n00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,200\nAnd so we see a lot of things\nthat the attackers might not.\n\n50\n00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,900\nAnd so, it's not necessarily\nan apples to apples comparison,\n\n51\n00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,360\nbecause the attacker might\nsee a much more limited view.\n\n52\n00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,920\nSo, that's where the next part comes in,\nwhich is penetration testing.\n\n53\n00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,340\nPenetration testing is where you put\nyourself outside the network just like\n\n54\n00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,460\nan attacker and see if you can get in.\n\n55\n00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,250\nSee if you can penetrate into that\nnetwork to gain access through some of\n\n56\n00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,515\nthe vulnerabilities that are available,\nall right?\n\n57\n00:03:14,515 --> 00:03:18,145\nCompTIA very specific in\ntheir terminology on this.\n\n58\n00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:19,735\nAnd you'll see it on the exam.\n\n59\n00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:22,325\nIf we look at our objective.\n\n60\n00:03:22,325 --> 00:03:25,114\nNate, you have the objectives\npulled up right, 3.7?\n\n61\n00:03:25,114 --> 00:03:26,645\n>> Mm-hm, yep.\nAbout halfway down on 3.7,\n\n62\n00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:29,605\nyou'll see where it talks\nabout assessment types,\n\n63\n00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:33,755\nhow you have risks, threats and\nvulnerabilities, okay?\n\n64\n00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,105\nA risk, well we always have risk, right?\n\n65\n00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:39,846\nThere is a risk that someone is going\nto break into your network, right?\n\n66\n00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:42,960\nAnd if they break into your network,\nwhat can they get ahold of?\n\n67\n00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,060\nWell, if you're a financial organization,\n\n68\n00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,750\nthey can get ahold of financial records,\nright, accounting records.\n\n69\n00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,550\nIf you're a bank, for example,\nthey might be able to get account info and\n\n70\n00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,540\nmaybe even get at the money, right?\n\n71\n00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,930\nIf you're a hospital, they can get\nat your medical records, right?\n\n72\n00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,570\nWhatever data it is that you have that's\nsensitive, that's your risk, okay?\n\n73\n00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,770\nAnd there's always the risk that\nsomebody could gain access to that.\n\n74\n00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,360\nAnd then, turn it into whatever\nit is that they plan to do.\n\n75\n00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,280\nBut, just because there's a risk,\ndoesn't mean it's going to happen, right?\n\n76\n00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,293\nIf you're a hospital, there's a risk\nsomebody could get your medical records.\n\n77\n00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:18,150\nBut, there isn't necessarily a way for\nthem to do that.\n\n78\n00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:23,050\nSo, it may be that risk never comes to\nfruition, never actually happens, right?\n\n79\n00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:25,230\nBut it is something that we plan for, so\n\n80\n00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,840\nwhen we talk about risks we're always\ntalking about preemptive things,\n\n81\n00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,951\nthings we can do to mitigate or\nminimize that risk coming true, all right?\n\n82\n00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,070\nThen we have vulnerabilities.\n\n83\n00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,980\nIf someone wants to get into my system,\n\n84\n00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,840\nmy system is going to have\nto have a weak point.\n\n85\n00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,230\nA weak point that they're able to take\nadvantage of to get in, all right?\n\n86\n00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,640\nThat's a vulnerability.\n\n87\n00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,280\nSo, any weak point in my system,\nmaybe I have a web server that's\n\n88\n00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,450\nexposed to the Internet that I\nhaven't updated in six months.\n\n89\n00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,480\nMaybe I have a firewall that\nwasn't configured properly, and\n\n90\n00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,160\nit's sitting there, again, in-between\nthe Internet and my internal network.\n\n91\n00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,610\nMaybe I have an internal employee who has\nmore permissions than they should, right?\n\n92\n00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,220\nAnd thus could gain access\nto systems if they tried.\n\n93\n00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,100\nThat's a vulnerability, all right?\n\n94\n00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,030\nThese are all vulnerabilities.\n\n95\n00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,290\nBut just because a vulnerability is there,\n\n96\n00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,670\ndoesn't mean it's actually\nbeen taken advantage of.\n\n97\n00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,500\nAnd in some cases it, there may not\nbe a way to take advantage of it.\n\n98\n00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,900\nThere might be a weakness that we know,\n\n99\n00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,030\nbut there's not a good way\nto take advantage of it.\n\n100\n00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:31,480\nAn example of that would be\nlike SSL certificates, right?\n\n101\n00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,450\nSSL certs, most of them these\ndays are 2,048 bit, used for\n\n102\n00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,250\ntheir key modulus,\nwhich makes them really strong.\n\n103\n00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,180\nAnd it would take over a billion years for\n\n104\n00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,340\na single computer to\nbe able to break that.\n\n105\n00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,680\nThat's a vulnerability.\n\n106\n00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,590\nThere is a vulnerability.\n\n107\n00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,040\nIt is possible that somebody could\nsit down with a computer and\n\n108\n00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,500\nspend a billion years and then break\nthat certificate and get into it, okay?\n\n109\n00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,010\nThat's a vulnerability.\n\n110\n00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,590\nBut it's not our next word,\nwhich is a threat.\n\n111\n00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,810\nA threat is a vulnerability that can\nbe taken advantage of, all right?\n\n112\n00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,780\nThe weakness of that SSL key,\nthe weakness, right,\n\n113\n00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,920\nbecause it would take a billion years.\n\n114\n00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,760\nIt doesn’t matter, right?\n\n115\n00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,490\nIt’s not a threat because it\njust would take too long.\n\n116\n00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,990\nNobody’s gonna be able to sit there and\n\n117\n00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,520\nspend that amount of time to try and\nbreak my encryption key, all right?\n\n118\n00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,250\nThey're gonna move on to other\nvulnerabilities that they can take\n\n119\n00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,240\nadvantage of.\n\n120\n00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,080\nSo, a vulnerability is only\ndangerous when it becomes a threat\n\n121\n00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,270\nwhen there is a way to\ntake advantage of it.\n\n122\n00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,190\nAnd just like at Heartbleed, right?\n\n123\n00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,340\nWhere they said, okay.\n\n124\n00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,450\nWell, we can't sit there and just break\nthe private key over time by brute force.\n\n125\n00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,600\nIt would take too long.\n\n126\n00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,950\nBut if we can get access to the private\nkey itself through a weakness in\n\n127\n00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,745\nthe protocol,\nthat's a different story, right?\n\n128\n00:06:44,745 --> 00:06:47,770\nHeartbleed completely broke the SSL for\na little while, and\n\n129\n00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:52,620\nit did it without brute forcing the keys,\nso it was very quick, very fast.\n\n130\n00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,370\nSo, brute forcing the key is\na vulnerability, but not a threat.\n\n131\n00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,590\nCompromising the private key through\nleaked data in the protocol,\n\n132\n00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:06,100\nthat was a threat, right, and one that was\ntaken advantage of in quite a few places.\n\n133\n00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,310\nSo, that's the difference\nin that terminology,\n\n134\n00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,520\nso be familiar with that, right?\n\n135\n00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,080\nSo, the difference between a risk,\n\n136\n00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,520\nwhich is just anywhere we could\npotentially lose information.\n\n137\n00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,270\nA vulnerability,\nany weak point in our network\n\n138\n00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,130\nregardless of whether it can\nbe used against us or not.\n\n139\n00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:28,380\nAnd then a threat is that weak point\nthat has a way to be exploited,\n\n140\n00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,050\nto actually be used by an attacker,\nall right?\n\n141\n00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,000\nSo, the trick to all of this\nis your network, my network,\n\n142\n00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,170\neverybody's network has risks and\nvulnerabilities.\n\n143\n00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,890\nIt just goes without saying.\n\n144\n00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,290\nEverybody has that.\n\n145\n00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,960\nSo the trick is you need to find\nthose before your attacker does.\n\n146\n00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,548\nAnd, the best way to do that is\nthrough penetration testing and\n\n147\n00:07:50,548 --> 00:07:52,116\nvulnerability scanning.\n\n148\n00:07:52,116 --> 00:07:55,614\nYou need to be looking at your network and\nsaying, all right, if I were an attacker,\n\n149\n00:07:55,614 --> 00:07:56,418\nhow could I get in?\n\n150\n00:07:56,418 --> 00:08:01,058\nHow could I get into this system and\ndo as much damage as possible, right?\n\n151\n00:08:01,058 --> 00:08:03,026\nOr Maybe it's not about damage.\n\n152\n00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:07,138\nHow can I get into the system and get data\nwithout leaving a foot print behind and\n\n153\n00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:10,370\nthen just get out without\nactually damaging anything?\n\n154\n00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,720\nThose are the types of things\nthat the attacker is thinking of.\n\n155\n00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,600\nAnd if you think like the attacker,\nyou can walk through that same process and\n\n156\n00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,390\nthen take the precautions\nto protect your system.\n\n157\n00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,152\nRight.\nThat's what it's all about.\n\n158\n00:08:22,152 --> 00:08:23,115\nAll right?\n\n159\n00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:26,870\nNow, there are a, what's a good word here?\n\n160\n00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,310\nA plethora of tools.\n\n161\n00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,095\nA virtual cornucopia of tools out there\non the internet that you can use for\n\n162\n00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:32,896\nthis, right?\n\n163\n00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:35,884\nThere's commercial tools that cost\ntens of thousands of dollars, and\n\n164\n00:08:35,884 --> 00:08:39,243\nthere's open source tools that are\nabsolutely free and don't cost you a dime.\n\n165\n00:08:39,243 --> 00:08:41,580\nIt's up to you which ones you wanna use.\n\n166\n00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,850\nThe more sensitive your network,\n\n167\n00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:45,020\nobviously, the more money\nyou're going to pay.\n\n168\n00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,398\nBut there are a lot of tools out there.\n\n169\n00:08:47,398 --> 00:08:51,340\nAnd I wanna show you guys some examples,\nkind of give you an idea of what it's like\n\n170\n00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:55,074\nto do vulnerability scanning and\npenetration testing.\n\n171\n00:08:55,074 --> 00:08:58,260\nAll right, first off,\nvulnerability scanning.\n\n172\n00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,250\nAll right, you should be doing\nvulnerability scanning on your network\n\n173\n00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,160\nevery single day, all right.\n\n174\n00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,900\nEvery single day.\n\n175\n00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,750\nThis is something that should be\na routine activity on your network.\n\n176\n00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,198\nVulnerability scanning is where you look\nat the equipment on your network, and\n\n177\n00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:15,090\nyou say, all right, is there\nanything here that's a weak point?\n\n178\n00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:15,607\nRight.\n\n179\n00:09:15,607 --> 00:09:18,170\nNow, you might ask yourself,\nwhy scan everyday?\n\n180\n00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,990\nIf I scanned yesterday,\nwhy do I need to scan today?\n\n181\n00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,740\nThe reason is your network changes.\n\n182\n00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,430\nPeople make changes to their computer.\n\n183\n00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,355\nPeople will install updates,\ninstall additional software,\n\n184\n00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:32,036\nwill turn off security features sometimes.\n\n185\n00:09:32,036 --> 00:09:32,964\nYou need to know that.\n\n186\n00:09:32,964 --> 00:09:36,370\nAnd so,\nyou should be scanning every single day.\n\n187\n00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:40,034\nYou can be constantly scanning if you\nhave something like the Qualys scan guard\n\n188\n00:09:40,034 --> 00:09:41,434\nboxes, I love those things.\n\n189\n00:09:41,434 --> 00:09:43,332\nThey're these appliances\nthey just sit there and\n\n190\n00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,097\nconstantly scan your network looking for\nvulnerabilities that pop up.\n\n191\n00:09:46,097 --> 00:09:50,480\nThat way you're notified right away when\nsomebody makes a change they shouldn't.\n\n192\n00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,290\nThere's other ones.\n\n193\n00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,720\nThere's free software that's out there.\n\n194\n00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,760\nThere's actually a ton of software\nout there for vulnerability scanning.\n\n195\n00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,965\nWhich one you choose is really up to you.\n\n196\n00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:58,598\nOkay.\n\n197\n00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,355\nLet's run down a couple of them.\n\n198\n00:10:01,355 --> 00:10:03,624\nI know, Nate,\nyou've got some that you like, and stuff.\n\n199\n00:10:03,624 --> 00:10:08,494\nBut one example of one that's kinda\nfree that you can mess around with is\n\n200\n00:10:08,494 --> 00:10:10,293\nSecureCheq by Tripwire.\n\n201\n00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:12,950\nI'm not the biggest fan of this one.\n\n202\n00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,860\nIt's free just for\nscanning your own system and\n\n203\n00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,256\nif you wanna scan the rest of\nyour network, it costs money.\n\n204\n00:10:17,256 --> 00:10:19,746\nBut it also only scans Windows systems.\n\n205\n00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:20,541\nThat's why I don't like it.\n\n206\n00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:25,304\nIf you just wanna scan Windows systems,\nSecureCheq is great, but if you wanna\n\n207\n00:10:25,304 --> 00:10:31,070\nscan Linux or if you wanna scan like Cisco\nrouters or whatever, it won't do that.\n\n208\n00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,938\nBut here, you see an example I\nscanned a machine before the show.\n\n209\n00:10:33,938 --> 00:10:37,010\nAnd it just ran the quick scan,\nit took a few seconds.\n\n210\n00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,673\nAnd it's got a list of, I don't know,\nit's probably about 100 different\n\n211\n00:10:41,673 --> 00:10:46,000\nthings that it tested for here to see\nif I had any weaknesses in my system.\n\n212\n00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,430\nAnd so, like here,\nWindows Firewall IPv6 Block Protocols 41.\n\n213\n00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,410\nSo, it's got a rule here that says,\nhey, this machine\n\n214\n00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:00,110\nshould have this rule in place to secure\nIPv6 and, in this case, mine is secured.\n\n215\n00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,640\nI passed that test.\n\n216\n00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,560\nBut all the way at the top,\n\n217\n00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,020\nyou saw the tests that I've failed and\nthere were quite a few, right?\n\n218\n00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,080\nLike this one here.\n\n219\n00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,887\nWindows remote desktop configured\nto always prompt for password.\n\n220\n00:11:09,887 --> 00:11:10,479\nAll right?\n\n221\n00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:14,608\nWell, the way I have remote\ndesktop configured on this system,\n\n222\n00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:16,140\nI can save my password.\n\n223\n00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,980\nSo, I don't have to enter it every\ntime I connect, cuz I'm lazy.\n\n224\n00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,620\nBut that's not a good thing because if\nan attacker gets a hold of a system where\n\n225\n00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,340\nI've cached my password, they can\nnow remote into this one, all right.\n\n226\n00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,816\nSo, there's actually a setting we can\nconfigure that changes that behavior.\n\n227\n00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:31,678\nAnd says, you know what,\ndon't allow cache in the password.\n\n228\n00:11:31,678 --> 00:11:35,814\nMake it where, if someone RDPs in, they\nhave to enter the password every time,\n\n229\n00:11:35,814 --> 00:11:37,000\nthey can't cache it.\n\n230\n00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,545\nAll right?\n\n231\n00:11:37,545 --> 00:11:41,750\nI don't have that set, and so,\nit tripped it here as failed.\n\n232\n00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,630\nI failed that connection.\n\n233\n00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,774\nAnd that's making my system\nweaker than it should be.\n\n234\n00:11:45,774 --> 00:11:46,349\nRight?\n\n235\n00:11:46,349 --> 00:11:48,369\nI like how it says confidence secured.\n\n236\n00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:50,969\nOh, I guess that's just they're slogan\nup there, but failed right here.\n\n237\n00:11:50,969 --> 00:11:53,600\nThis kind of big red\nwarning let's us know.\n\n238\n00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,460\nBut you'll see other ones that passed like\nanonymous access to Windows shares is\n\n239\n00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,330\ndisallowed, passed.\n\n240\n00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,090\nSo, I can see which ones have passed or\n\n241\n00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:06,470\nfailed, just because I fixed it today,\ndoesn't mean it'll be fixed forever.\n\n242\n00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,770\nSo, I might need to update this,\nor re-scan once a day,\n\n243\n00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,500\nonce a week, whatever, just to make\nsure the system is still in compliance.\n\n244\n00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,580\nAll right.\nThis is basically what\n\n245\n00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,720\na vulnerability scanner does.\n\n246\n00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,270\nAll right.\n\n247\n00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,410\nNow, I mentioned I used this on\nthe show because it was free and\n\n248\n00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,150\nvery simple, but I'm not a big fan of it.\n\n249\n00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,520\nThere's much more powerful ones out there.\n\n250\n00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,580\nThe one I actually like\nthe most is Metasploit.\n\n251\n00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,790\nDo I have their web page\npulled up somewhere?\n\n252\n00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,376\nHere's the secure check.\n\n253\n00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:34,041\nHere we go.\n\n254\n00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:35,610\nOh, no, that's Nexpose.\n\n255\n00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,320\nShoot.\n\n256\n00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,290\nWhere is Metasploit?\n\n257\n00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,550\nHere we go, Metasploit.\n\n258\n00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,705\nSo, If I can find their web page here.\n\n259\n00:12:41,705 --> 00:12:44,815\nMetasploit.com is their website.\n\n260\n00:12:44,815 --> 00:12:47,695\nThey have this utility,\nit's called Metasploit.\n\n261\n00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:51,465\nAnd it will scan Windows,\nLinux, Cisco, Juniper, whatever.\n\n262\n00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:53,320\nIt'll scan everything.\n\n263\n00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,800\nAnd they have a massive\ndatabase of exploits.\n\n264\n00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,840\nAnd it just sees which ones it\ncan use on your systems, right?\n\n265\n00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,160\nIt identifies which systems\nare vulnerable to those exploits.\n\n266\n00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,309\nSo, it scans them,\ncollects that information, and\n\n267\n00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:06,897\ngives it to you in a nice little report.\n\n268\n00:13:06,897 --> 00:13:07,710\nAll right?\n\n269\n00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:12,480\nThe thing about Metasploit\nis they have a free version.\n\n270\n00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,090\nIt's not particularly awesome but if you\ndo the paid version, it's very awesome.\n\n271\n00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,800\nAnd if you have the paid version, not only\nwill it tell you the exploits are there,\n\n272\n00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,400\nit will let you test them.\n\n273\n00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,480\nYou can actually say, run the exploit.\n\n274\n00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,635\nAnd it will reach out of the server and\ntry to actually use it.\n\n275\n00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:28,067\nCuz it's one thing to be told,\nyou've protected yourself.\n\n276\n00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:31,371\nIt's another thing to actually see\nthat that exploit doesn't work and\n\n277\n00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:33,362\nthat's what a tool like Metasploit does.\n\n278\n00:13:33,362 --> 00:13:34,800\nIt's really cool.\n\n279\n00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,590\nAnd do they have like screen shot or\nsomething here?\n\n280\n00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,825\nI would have installed Metasploit but\nit actually does require a good bit.\n\n281\n00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:44,520\nYou got to bring up a data base server and\n\n282\n00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,830\na couple of other things to\nget it all tied together.\n\n283\n00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,179\nBut, you know, you'd think they'd have\nmore screen shots than just that.\n\n284\n00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:53,880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me see if I can\n\n285\n00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,300\nfind something better here,\nas far as screen shots.\n\n286\n00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,260\nBut it is a good utility.\n\n287\n00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,120\nI've used it in a number of organizations.\n\n288\n00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,300\nThat's an awesome screen shot there.\n\n289\n00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,690\nThese aren't really what\nI was hoping to find.\n\n290\n00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,290\nBut anyhow, so it'll scan.\n\n291\n00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,230\nIt'll give you that information.\n\n292\n00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,230\nIt's really cool stuff and it,\nyou know, supports multiple platforms.\n\n293\n00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,040\nThat's why I like that one the most.\n\n294\n00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,860\nBut there are other products\nthat are out there like Nexpose.\n\n295\n00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,460\nNexpose is actually from\nthe same people as Metasploit.\n\n296\n00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,000\nIt's a little more lightweight.\n\n297\n00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,821\nBut again, it will let you\nscan your system and check for\n\n298\n00:14:28,821 --> 00:14:31,270\nthose exploits that are out there.\n\n299\n00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,435\nThere's a few other big names that\nare out there, like EI, well no,\n\n300\n00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:35,317\nEI got bought out.\n\n301\n00:14:35,317 --> 00:14:36,402\nSo, now its Beyond Trust.\n\n302\n00:14:36,402 --> 00:14:38,457\nThey have a program called Retina.\n\n303\n00:14:38,457 --> 00:14:41,884\nAnd Retina, very, very similar,\nscans across the network,\n\n304\n00:14:41,884 --> 00:14:44,540\nchecking your machines for\nvulnerabilities.\n\n305\n00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,790\nThese guys have good screen shots.\n\n306\n00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,030\nSee if we can look at some of these.\n\n307\n00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,540\nSo, scanning across,\nshowing the high threat machines.\n\n308\n00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,640\nOnes that you need to go and\nsecure right away.\n\n309\n00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,980\nMedium and low, kind of laying out what it\nis that their vulnerability happens to be.\n\n310\n00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,885\nSo, you can see that information and\nyou can just constantly scan your network.\n\n311\n00:15:01,885 --> 00:15:04,295\nYou're looking for\nexploits on your network, so\n\n312\n00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:08,935\nthat you can find them and fix them\nprior to the attackers doing it, right.\n\n313\n00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:10,695\nCuz they're gonna be doing the same thing.\n\n314\n00:15:10,695 --> 00:15:14,428\nAnd they might even be using these\nsame tools in a lot of cases.\n\n315\n00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:18,360\n>> [INAUDIBLE] These tools here, these\nare running from within your networks.\n\n316\n00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,740\nSo, not necessarily on the outside,\nbut once the attacker has gotten\n\n317\n00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,100\ninside your network and\nthat's where these tools are being ran.\n\n318\n00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,520\n>> As a rule of thumb,\nwhen you're doing vulnerability scanning,\n\n319\n00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,570\nyou wanna do it from inside your network.\n\n320\n00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:34,380\nAll right, you're basically saying, what\nhappens if a hacker gets past my firewall?\n\n321\n00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,930\nIf they get past my IPS and IDS boxes,\n\n322\n00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,405\nwhat happens if they're\ninside the network?\n\n323\n00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,520\nCuz remember the attack\nmight come from the inside.\n\n324\n00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,600\nIt might be your own employees\nthat are doing this,\n\n325\n00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,450\nthat are trying to get into these systems.\n\n326\n00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:49,070\nSo, vulnerability scans should\nbe done from the inside.\n\n327\n00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,195\nPenetration testing,\n\n328\n00:15:50,195 --> 00:15:53,748\nyou can do it from the inside if you're\nworried about internal employees.\n\n329\n00:15:53,748 --> 00:15:57,500\nBut you also wanna do it from the outside\nbecause that's where most of your\n\n330\n00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,145\nattackers are gonna come from.\n\n331\n00:15:59,145 --> 00:16:00,724\n>> And then, what about time?\n\n332\n00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:04,655\nYou know how How long would it\ntake to run one of these tests?\n\n333\n00:16:04,655 --> 00:16:06,940\n>> Really depends on the size\nof the network, right?\n\n334\n00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,270\nSo just something like a simple\nreconnaissance attach,\n\n335\n00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:14,050\njust trying to gather information about a\nsystem can usually take about a minute or\n\n336\n00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,800\ntwo per host that you scan.\n\n337\n00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,880\nAnd so if you're doing that\nit could take you hours,\n\n338\n00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,370\nit could take a long time\nto fully scan a network.\n\n339\n00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,292\nWell, the attackers that are out there\non the Internet, they're patient.\n\n340\n00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:25,999\nThey've got that time.\n\n341\n00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:27,680\nYou should be too, right?\n\n342\n00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,530\nRun that scan.\n\n343\n00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,330\nNow, how often you do\nit's a different story?\n\n344\n00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,810\nWith vulnerability scanning,\nI say you should do it every day, right?\n\n345\n00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,950\nBut when it comes to penetration testing,\n\n346\n00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,300\nyou don't wanna be constantly\ntrying to break into you network.\n\n347\n00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,165\nYour ISP is gonna get mad at you sooner or\nlater.\n\n348\n00:16:41,165 --> 00:16:42,110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n349\n00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,490\nyou normally want to do those kind of\ntests either every few months, every six\n\n350\n00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:50,280\nmonths is what a lot of organizations\ndo or after any significant changes.\n\n351\n00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,090\nAnytime new systems have\nbeen implemented or\n\n352\n00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:55,130\nwhatever you should do\npenetration testing to make sure.\n\n353\n00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,390\nAnother good idea is to not\ndo penetration testing, but\n\n354\n00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,370\ninstead contract to someone else.\n\n355\n00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:04,830\nGet an outside party come in and\ndo the penetration testing.\n\n356\n00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:10,740\nWhen you do it, you have the unfair\nadvantage of really knowing that network,\n\n357\n00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,650\nknowing all the components and\nyou can be a little bit blinded to some of\n\n358\n00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,920\nthe other alternatives that\nare out there for getting in.\n\n359\n00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,080\nWhen you contract somebody to come and\ndo it, it's an outside set of eyes.\n\n360\n00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,720\nThey have a different perspective,\ndifferent ideas, and\n\n361\n00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,430\nthey may be able to find exploits\nthat you didn't find yourself\n\n362\n00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,320\nbecause you've got that predisposition.\n\n363\n00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,030\nSo that's another thing to keep in mind.\n\n364\n00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:30,950\nAll right.\nSo\n\n365\n00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,950\nthat's an example of\nvulnerability scanners, right?\n\n366\n00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,700\nNow some of the tools we're gonna\nlook at really skirt the lines.\n\n367\n00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,600\nThey kinda cross between more than\none terminology that's out there.\n\n368\n00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,150\nWhen you're testing a network for security\nyou're gonna use a whole suite of tools.\n\n369\n00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,000\nAnd it's up to you which ones you use.\n\n370\n00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,750\nBut there are a number of\ndifferent ones out there.\n\n371\n00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,440\nSo a vulnerability scanner's really\njust one piece of it, all right?\n\n372\n00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,120\nWhen an attacker starts to\nbreak into your network.\n\n373\n00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,800\nWhen they start to try and\nget gain access.\n\n374\n00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,830\nThey almost always begin with\na reconnaissance attack.\n\n375\n00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:06,360\nAnd when you do a reconnaissance attack,\nyou're really just scanning a network\n\n376\n00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,040\nlooking for what's out there and\nwhat software is being run.\n\n377\n00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,380\nAnd so you're gonna utilize\na tool something like Nmap.\n\n378\n00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,160\nAnd I wanna show you guys Nmap.\n\n379\n00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,440\nNmap is a completely free program,\nit's open source.\n\n380\n00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,950\nYou can go and get it at nmap.org.\n\n381\n00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,600\nAnd it's a neat little utility that\nwill scan across your network.\n\n382\n00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,785\nAnd you can use it just to\nfind hosts on the network.\n\n383\n00:18:26,785 --> 00:18:32,405\nYou can also use it to scan hosts and\nget more information about them.\n\n384\n00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:37,895\nSo for example, if I wanted to take a look\nat my network here, I might want to scan\n\n385\n00:18:37,895 --> 00:18:42,860\nthe, let's do this network here.\n\n386\n00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,000\nAnd I'll just do a PNG sweep.\n\n387\n00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,200\nSo I'm gonna tell it to do a PNG scan\nof the Tenda1.230 network, all right.\n\n388\n00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,560\nAnd when it runs that scan,\nwhat it's gonna do is,\n\n389\n00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,600\nit's gonna look across that network.\n\n390\n00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,800\nAnd it's gonna see how many\nhost it can their rather,\n\n391\n00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,370\nwho's out there that's responding to PNGs.\n\n392\n00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,280\nAnd I must have done my syntax\nwrong because it is not scanning.\n\n393\n00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:09,940\n>> A little bar on the far right,\nthere's kinda moving up and down.\n\n394\n00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,360\n>> Yeah, but it should have at\nleast found the router first,\n\n395\n00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,180\nI think it might want a zero there.\n\n396\n00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,900\nLet's try that again.\n\n397\n00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,320\nOh, you know what?\n\n398\n00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,070\nIt's my own firewall.\n\n399\n00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,030\nSo this is another thing.\n\n400\n00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,360\nWhen you start doing attacks.\n\n401\n00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:22,920\nThere it goes.\n\n402\n00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,160\nYeah, now it's working.\n\n403\n00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,650\nWhen you start doing attacks like these,\n\n404\n00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,820\nsometimes your own firewall, like the\nfirewall that I've got here on Windows 8,\n\n405\n00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,960\ncan actually block this\nfrom working in some cases.\n\n406\n00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,130\nBut notice all these hosts\nthat it's filling in here.\n\n407\n00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,930\nSo it's started finding\nthese hosts on the network.\n\n408\n00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,270\nSo as an attacker,\n\n409\n00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:42,550\nnow I know the IP addresses of machines\nthat I can start to reach out to.\n\n410\n00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:46,330\nAnd see if I can gain access to it, right?\n\n411\n00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,060\nOnce I've done that I can take that host,\nright?\n\n412\n00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,280\nWhoever it is that I found so\nlike here I'll take the very first IP.\n\n413\n00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,770\nUsually we assume that\nfirst IP is a router.\n\n414\n00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,280\nSo this is probably something that\nwould be pretty useful to get into.\n\n415\n00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,420\nAnd in fact if I look at the MAC address\nit's already resolved that it's a Cisco\n\n416\n00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,330\nsystems Mac so it's again,\nmore than likely a router.\n\n417\n00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,320\nSo now I can take this one host and\nI can scan it.\n\n418\n00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,262\nAnd so I'll switch from a PNG\nscan to an intense scan.\n\n419\n00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,540\nThere we go, an intense scan.\n\n420\n00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,380\nAnd so I'll run my scan against that.\n\n421\n00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,330\nAnd now it's looking at that one\nhost trying to find out as much\n\n422\n00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:27,800\ninformation about it as it can.\n\n423\n00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,540\nNow when it does this it's taking\na look at a number of different things.\n\n424\n00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,910\nIt's taking a look at how\nthe TCP headers are kind of\n\n425\n00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,970\nbuilt inside of the packet cuz that allows\nfor thumb printing or finger printing,\n\n426\n00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:42,730\nfoot printing, whatever you want to\ncall it, of the host I'm connected to.\n\n427\n00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:46,290\nThat's how it's gonna try to figure\nout what OS it's running and\n\n428\n00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,790\nhopefully what version?\n\n429\n00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,540\nIt's also going to look\nat what ports are open?\n\n430\n00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,300\nSo it'll run a scan across the system to\nsee what ports respond to a connection\n\n431\n00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,080\nrequest.\n\n432\n00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,530\nAnd you can see that happening right here.\n\n433\n00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,080\nDiscovered open port 22 and open port 43.\n\n434\n00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,614\nSo that's SSH and SSL.\n\n435\n00:21:01,614 --> 00:21:05,713\nAnd then it tries to get into them,\nand so I can see here,\n\n436\n00:21:05,713 --> 00:21:10,200\nit connected and\nit is running Cisco SSH protocol 1.99.\n\n437\n00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:16,290\nNow, with SSH's version 1 and version 2,\nwhat the heck does 1.99 mean?\n\n438\n00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:19,870\nWell, that's actually part\nof the open SSH standard.\n\n439\n00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,690\nWhen you see 1.99, that means it's\nrunning SSH version 1 and version 2.\n\n440\n00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,670\nSo it's running both, and that means that\n\n441\n00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,650\nthere can be slightly less secure SSH\nversion 1 connections being built.\n\n442\n00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,750\nThat I might be able to break into.\n\n443\n00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:39,670\nI also see that it's running SSL, and it's\nrunning the Cisco iOS HTTP web service.\n\n444\n00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,730\nSo I can use that information,\nnow I can go out and\n\n445\n00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:46,340\njust do a quick Google search for\nCisco iOS HPPT expoints, right?\n\n446\n00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:50,250\nAnd maybe I can find some and start\nto leverage that against this system.\n\n447\n00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,030\nAll right, it also tried to figure out,\n\n448\n00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:58,030\nsomewhere in here it tried to figure out\nthe OS that I was running, here we go.\n\n449\n00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,740\nIt's running Cisco iOS 12.x.\n\n450\n00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,020\nIt wasn't able to nail it\ndown much further than that.\n\n451\n00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,390\nIt wasn't able to nail down the hardware,\neither.\n\n452\n00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:10,980\nNow that is a 4500 switch, so it's got\nthat in the list of possibilities here.\n\n453\n00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,530\nSo it got pretty close.\n\n454\n00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,924\nAnd it says the iOS is 12.1 to 15.0.\n\n455\n00:22:15,924 --> 00:22:18,730\nAnd that's true,\nI think it's actually running 12.2.\n\n456\n00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,570\nSo notice this is like 12.1 to 15.0.\n\n457\n00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,060\nAll I have to do is go\nto Cisco's website and\n\n458\n00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:31,053\npull up the release documentation for\n15.1.\n\n459\n00:22:31,053 --> 00:22:33,312\nWhat was fixed in 15.1?\n\n460\n00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:39,075\nAnything that was fixed in 15.1 was broken\nin whatever this switch is running.\n\n461\n00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:42,585\nAnd now I can go and\nuse that as my exploit to get in, right?\n\n462\n00:22:42,585 --> 00:22:45,755\nThe vendors tell you how to break\ninto their own hardware, right?\n\n463\n00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:49,950\nAnd it's all a part of\nreleasing information.\n\n464\n00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:53,440\nNow they released the fixes too and\nif you haven't applied the patches and\n\n465\n00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,545\nupdates then it's your own fault.\n\n466\n00:22:55,545 --> 00:22:57,760\nSo you need to keep your\nsystems up to date.\n\n467\n00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,760\nAll right now that's a Cisco switch there.\n\n468\n00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,430\nI also scanned a Windows\nserver before the show.\n\n469\n00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,760\nOne that I made intentionally less secure.\n\n470\n00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,400\nSo like, I turned the Windows Firewall\noff, I turned on the Telnet server.\n\n471\n00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,280\nI did all sorts of nasty things you\nwould never do on a real server.\n\n472\n00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,047\nAnd let's see, is it gonna, hello?\n\n473\n00:23:19,047 --> 00:23:21,660\n[LAUGH] Is it not gonna\nopen that one up for me?\n\n474\n00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,020\n>> Right, was that one there\njust your PNG scan, PNG sweep?\n\n475\n00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,050\n>> Well, it's showing the PNG sweep but\nit's still,\n\n476\n00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,370\nsee how it's got the like\nthe little logo there?\n\n477\n00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:34,422\nI thought it would retain the scan I\ndid earlier, but I guess it didn't.\n\n478\n00:23:34,422 --> 00:23:36,930\nAll right here,\nI'll just redo the intense scan on it.\n\n479\n00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:41,680\nSo this is a Windows server that like\nI said I made it a little less secure\n\n480\n00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,720\nthan it should be.\n\n481\n00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,590\nIt's running things like Telnet server and\n\n482\n00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,300\nFTP and\na bunch of weird services like that.\n\n483\n00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,199\nSo I'm just gonna let it\nscan that real quick.\n\n484\n00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:54,909\nWhen it does this scan, it's trying to\nfind anything it can to identify what this\n\n485\n00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:56,935\nserver is and what it's running?\n\n486\n00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:01,116\nAnd one of the techniques for\nthat is whats called banner grabbing.\n\n487\n00:24:01,116 --> 00:24:04,437\nWhen you connect to a web server or\nan FTP server or\n\n488\n00:24:04,437 --> 00:24:07,230\na SMTP server, they display a banner.\n\n489\n00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,410\nA little message.\n\n490\n00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:09,280\nOkay.\n\n491\n00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,030\nAnd that message, what it's made up of,\na lot of times will communicate what\n\n492\n00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:17,520\ntype of server you're running and\nwhat version of that server?\n\n493\n00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,000\nNow most of the vendors out\nthere are wised up to this and\n\n494\n00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,750\nthey don't hand that information out.\n\n495\n00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,090\nSome of them haven't.\n\n496\n00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,497\nSome of them, if you connect in on a\ncertain port or whatever, they'll actually\n\n497\n00:24:27,497 --> 00:24:31,080\ntell you like hey, you've connected\nto Microsoft Exchange Version 2010.\n\n498\n00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,880\nAnd so it gives you that hint to\nknow what type of server it is.\n\n499\n00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,820\nAnd so now you can go out and\nfind exploits for that particular server.\n\n500\n00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,990\nThey almost like guide you into, what\nyou need to know to attack the system?\n\n501\n00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,220\nSo here, I found a bunch of\nopen ports on this server.\n\n502\n00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,630\nYeah, so I found a bunch of open ports,\nincluding the FTP port and Telnet.\n\n503\n00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,970\nSo I can see those and now it's starting\nto reach out and connect to those.\n\n504\n00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,100\nSo it's gonna try and\nidentify information about the server, and\n\n505\n00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,000\nreturn that back to me so\nI can have it as the attacker.\n\n506\n00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,050\nNow I'll have that information.\n\n507\n00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,220\nNow could this stuff have been stopped?\n\n508\n00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,360\nAbsolutely.\n\n509\n00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,850\nIf you have an intrusion detection,\n\n510\n00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,890\nnot detection,\nan intrusion prevention system, right?\n\n511\n00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:12,920\nAn IPS.\n\n512\n00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,840\nAn IPS will see when scans like this\nare happening and it'll stop them.\n\n513\n00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,950\nSo instead of scanning and\nfinding all these open ports.\n\n514\n00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:24,130\nThe IPS would see me scanning and\nstop me, and I would never see that.\n\n515\n00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,040\nI'd see that all the ports were closed\neven though they were actually opened.\n\n516\n00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,560\nSo scan behavior is pretty easy\nto recognize on the network.\n\n517\n00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,460\nHere we go, it just finished.\n\n518\n00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,900\nAll right.\nSo here it's showing me what\n\n519\n00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,270\nthe services are.\n\n520\n00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,550\nAnd see up here,\n\n521\n00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:41,630\nit actually connected to the FTP\nserver cuz anonymous FTP is turned on.\n\n522\n00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,240\nAnd so it's returning my\ndirectory structure, right?\n\n523\n00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,160\nSo there's everything\nthat's in that folder.\n\n524\n00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,540\nIt's telling me that I am running\nthe Microsoft Telnet server DNS.\n\n525\n00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,587\nI'm running IIS 8.5.\n\n526\n00:25:53,587 --> 00:25:56,280\nSo it knows what version\nof IIS I'm running.\n\n527\n00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,620\nIt even connected up just to get\na little bit of information there.\n\n528\n00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,860\nAnd take a look at what's in there.\n\n529\n00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,020\nAnd there's a bunch of\nMicrosoft RPC connections.\n\n530\n00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:06,830\nSo definitely good\ninformation to be found.\n\n531\n00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,820\nAnd it did properly footprint my system.\n\n532\n00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,970\nIt is a Windows server 2012 machine,\n\n533\n00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,920\nand you'll see that it's got 2012\ntagged right there or Windows 7, right.\n\n534\n00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,060\nIt wasn't able to decipher\nbetween those two.\n\n535\n00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,870\nAll right, so\nlots of good information for an attacker.\n\n536\n00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,290\nThe attacker is learning\ninformation about that server\n\n537\n00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,590\nwithout actually breaking into it.\n\n538\n00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,320\nWithout actually doing anything wrong.\n\n539\n00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,210\nIn fact scans like these are not illegal,\nright?\n\n540\n00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,830\nThey're gathering information\nabout a server that's made\n\n541\n00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,920\npublicly available to them, right?\n\n542\n00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,220\nIt's not until they try and\n\n543\n00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,300\ntake advantage of this information\nthat they do something illegal.\n\n544\n00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,950\nSo most attacks start right here.\n\n545\n00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:44,210\nWith these types of reconnaissance scans\nand that's what we want to watch out for.\n\n546\n00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,170\nBut if we're doing\nthe vulnerability scanning,\n\n547\n00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:51,210\nif we're doing a penetration test then\nwe should be using these same tools.\n\n548\n00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,460\nOkay, so those are some of the things\nthat we need to be aware of,\n\n549\n00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,912\nthere are several other\nutilities that I wanna show you.\n\n550\n00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,100\nI know we're winding down on\ntime on this segment, though.\n\n551\n00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,652\nLet's see, is there anything I can\ntalk about quickly before the.\n\n552\n00:27:07,652 --> 00:27:08,710\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n553\n00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,850\nnow some of these tools are still\nvulnerability scanning.\n\n554\n00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,820\nNow we're just kind of looking, right?\n\n555\n00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,232\nWe're not actually doing anything to our\nnetwork, to our systems or anything.\n\n556\n00:27:17,232 --> 00:27:21,520\nNow Compdata they do call out\npassive versus active tools.\n\n557\n00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,970\nAnd so what we've been doing\nare just passive tools.\n\n558\n00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,060\nWe're just looking.\n\n559\n00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,890\nWe're poking around.\n\n560\n00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,000\nWe're seeing what is out there.\n\n561\n00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,810\nNow, some of the other tools that\nwe'll visit here a little bit later\n\n562\n00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,420\nwith the penetration testing.\n\n563\n00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:38,170\nThose will be active tools that are\nactively trying to exploit some of those\n\n564\n00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,350\nvulnerabilities, to try to get in there.\n\n565\n00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,110\nBut with us, what so\nfar we've been doing, just passive tools.\n\n566\n00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,610\n>> Yep.\n\n567\n00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,710\nAll right.\n\n568\n00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:49,413\nI do have one more passive tool that\nI wanna talk about before we wind up,\n\n569\n00:27:49,413 --> 00:27:51,032\nmove over to active and stuff.\n\n570\n00:27:51,032 --> 00:27:52,490\nBut let's save that for the next segment.\n\n571\n00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:56,270\nSo this is a pretty good spot for\nus to stop and take a break.\n\n572\n00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,420\nWhen we get back.\n\n573\n00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,520\nI wanna take a look at network scanning\nand protocol analyzers, right?\n\n574\n00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,980\nSo that's really cool stuff.\n\n575\n00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,766\nI work with it a lot.\n\n576\n00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:03,818\nSo I like to show it off.\n\n577\n00:28:03,818 --> 00:28:06,670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let's stop here and take a break.\n\n578\n00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:10,142\nAnd when we get back,\nprotocol analyzers, after this.\n\n579\n00:28:10,142 --> 00:28:13,678\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n580\n00:28:13,678 --> 00:28:18,873\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n581\n00:28:18,873 --> 00:28:20,722\nNow one of my favorite tools, and\n\n582\n00:28:20,722 --> 00:28:23,967\nI'm joking because everything's\nmy favorite, right.\n\n583\n00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:24,467\nBut one of my-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n584\n00:28:24,467 --> 00:28:25,387\n>> Favorite tools when\n\n585\n00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:28,320\nit comes to the world of\nnetworking is a protocol analyzer.\n\n586\n00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:34,530\nAnd I've worked with protocol analyzers\nfor over 15 years now, for a long time.\n\n587\n00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:37,090\nAnd they have changed so much.\n\n588\n00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,410\nSo let's just start with\nwhat the heck it is, right?\n\n589\n00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:43,410\nA protocol analyzer is very similar\nto well, it's normally packaged\n\n590\n00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:46,920\nwith a sniffer, so we normally hear\nthe terms used interchangeably.\n\n591\n00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,220\nProtocol analyzer and sniffer, but\nthey're really two different pieces.\n\n592\n00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:56,170\nA sniffer is a program or a hardware\nthat you plug into a network and\n\n593\n00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:59,830\nit captures all the traffic\nthat it can see on the network.\n\n594\n00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,790\nEverything that's passing over\nthe network, it captures and records it.\n\n595\n00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,340\nAll right?\n\n596\n00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,430\nThat is all a sniffer does.\n\n597\n00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,840\nIf you see it mentioned on the exam,\n\n598\n00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,630\na sniffer simply records traffic,\nthat's all it does.\n\n599\n00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:19,300\nA protocol analyzer then takes that\nrecorded traffic and analyzes it, right?\n\n600\n00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,640\nIt sorts it into protocols,\n\n601\n00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,110\nbreaks it apart, decodes the encoded\nparts of it, breaks apart the header and\n\n602\n00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:30,960\nstuff, and puts it into a form\nthat's easily human readable.\n\n603\n00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,900\nAll right?\n\n604\n00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,150\nThe traffic we gather off the network,\nit's not intended to be read by humans.\n\n605\n00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:38,330\nIt's sent in binary bits,\nit's got weird headers and stuff on it,\n\n606\n00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,020\nthat's all a jumbled mess that\ndoesn't mean a lot to us.\n\n607\n00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,700\nBut a protocol analyzer turns it into\nsomething that we can understand.\n\n608\n00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:50,260\nSo typically, you use a protocol\nanalyzer and a sniffer together.\n\n609\n00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,080\nA sniffer by itself gives you\na ton of data that you can't read.\n\n610\n00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,710\nA protocol analyzer doesn't\nhave data to work with so\n\n611\n00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,610\nthe two are normally together.\n\n612\n00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:03,530\nAnd in real life land most people\nuse the terms interchangeably.\n\n613\n00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:06,265\nOn the exam they will\nnot be interchangeable.\n\n614\n00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:08,870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Be aware of the difference.\n\n615\n00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,705\nSniffer gathers the data.\n\n616\n00:30:10,705 --> 00:30:13,680\nProtocol analyzer interprets the data.\n\n617\n00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,630\nSo when I first got started with protocol\nanalyzer it was back when I was originally\n\n618\n00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,300\nlearning Cisco equipment.\n\n619\n00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,920\nSo it was back in 1999 and\nthat was when I went to a class,\n\n620\n00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,808\na little five day class,\nto learn how to use a protocol analyzer.\n\n621\n00:30:25,808 --> 00:30:29,131\nAnd the protocol analyzer I\nwas learning cost $12,000.\n\n622\n00:30:29,131 --> 00:30:31,270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that was how much it cost.\n\n623\n00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,440\nAnd I didn't have to pay for it,\n\n624\n00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,280\nmy company paid for it and\nI used it all the time.\n\n625\n00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,970\nI used it every single day, it was\nreally awesome stuff, really expensive.\n\n626\n00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:45,580\nToday, you can get open\nsource protocol analyzers\n\n627\n00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,680\nthat do everything that one did that\nmy company paid $12,000 for years ago.\n\n628\n00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,020\nFor free right?\n\n629\n00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,610\nSo it's really come a long\nway over the years.\n\n630\n00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,840\nProtocol analyzers aren't the incredibly\nexpensive thing they used to be.\n\n631\n00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,610\nNow they're free,\nopen source and multi platform.\n\n632\n00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:05,620\nSo not only can you use them to interpret\nwhat's going on in your network, but\n\n633\n00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,240\nyour attackers can use them also.\n\n634\n00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,080\nSo we need to be aware of the types\nof things that they can, right?\n\n635\n00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,050\nWell when somebody's recording\ntraffic off of your network.\n\n636\n00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:18,840\nIf your traffic is encrypted,\nyou don't worry about it, all right?\n\n637\n00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,450\nSo what?\n\n638\n00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,590\nSomebody captured your data.\n\n639\n00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,380\nBig deal.\n\n640\n00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,700\nThey don't have your private keys.\n\n641\n00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,512\nIt could take them millions of\nyears to break that encryption,\n\n642\n00:31:26,512 --> 00:31:27,730\nso you're fine, right?\n\n643\n00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,025\nNot a big deal.\n\n644\n00:31:29,025 --> 00:31:32,355\nBut what if there's data passing\nover your network unencrypted, and\n\n645\n00:31:32,355 --> 00:31:34,105\nyou don't realize it, right?\n\n646\n00:31:34,105 --> 00:31:37,255\nThat you didn't realize a particular\nservice was running on the server, and\n\n647\n00:31:37,255 --> 00:31:38,995\nit was running in an unencrypted form.\n\n648\n00:31:38,995 --> 00:31:42,495\nOr you put an SSL\ncertificate on that website.\n\n649\n00:31:42,495 --> 00:31:47,345\nBut people are still connecting without\nusing SSL, and you didn't realize it.\n\n650\n00:31:47,345 --> 00:31:48,319\nThat happens a lot?\n\n651\n00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:54,027\nA lot of times it'll connect to software\nand will just assume that it uses SSL or\n\n652\n00:31:54,027 --> 00:31:57,239\nthat it is encrypted, and maybe it isn't.\n\n653\n00:31:57,239 --> 00:32:01,770\nIn the world of FTP, right, File\nTransfer Protocol, FTP is unencrypted.\n\n654\n00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,130\nIt's plain text across the network.\n\n655\n00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,270\nWell, there's two standards for\nencrypting it.\n\n656\n00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:09,000\nThere's SFTP, which is secure FTP,\n\n657\n00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,810\nwhere you send your File Transfer Protocol\nstuff over an SSH tunnel.\n\n658\n00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:16,220\nWhen you do that, you know it's encrypted.\n\n659\n00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,140\nBut the other one, the other technologies\nout there is called FTPS, or\n\n660\n00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,380\nfile transfer protocol over SSL,\nall right?\n\n661\n00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,840\nAnd with it,\nyou connect with regular old FTP, and\n\n662\n00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,290\nthen you use SSL to encrypt it,\nthe same way a web page works.\n\n663\n00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,780\nThe problem is, you negotiate\nthat security at connection time.\n\n664\n00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,674\nAnd a lot of servers are configured so\nthat if that negotiation fails,\n\n665\n00:32:37,674 --> 00:32:39,324\nyou go unencrypted, right?\n\n666\n00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:42,225\nAlmost everyone that I've\nworked with defaults to that,\n\n667\n00:32:42,225 --> 00:32:44,663\nthat it goes unencrypted by if it fails,\nright.\n\n668\n00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:47,198\nSo, if it fails, it just flips right\nover to unencrypted and that's it, and\n\n669\n00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:49,010\nyou don't necessarily know that, right?\n\n670\n00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,460\nSo, you can have communications on\nyour network that are unencrypted and\n\n671\n00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,110\nyou're unaware of it.\n\n672\n00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,480\nSo, we need to know.\n\n673\n00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,200\nAnd the best way to find out is to use\nsomething like a protocol analyzer.\n\n674\n00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,020\nRight?\nThe one I'm\n\n675\n00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,900\ngonna use here on the show\nis one called Wireshark.\n\n676\n00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:06,990\nAnd Wireshark is a free and\nopen source protocol analyzer.\n\n677\n00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,030\nIt's been around a long, long time.\n\n678\n00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:13,148\nIf you've been in the networking world for\na while, you've probably remember it by\n\n679\n00:33:13,148 --> 00:33:16,340\nit's old name which was Ethereal or\nEthereal, whatever it was.\n\n680\n00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:20,100\nBut anyhow, that was the old name this\nguy wrote it like in his spare time.\n\n681\n00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,788\nAnd then when he left that company they\nclaimed copyright over the name of\n\n682\n00:33:23,788 --> 00:33:24,520\nthe product.\n\n683\n00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,247\nSo he said fine, we'll change it and\nit became Wireshark.\n\n684\n00:33:27,247 --> 00:33:30,735\nIt's been Wireshark for, I don't know,\neight or nine years now, awhile.\n\n685\n00:33:30,735 --> 00:33:33,070\nBut, you can download it and install it.\n\n686\n00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:38,730\nThey do have it for, not just Windows,\nbut they also have it for\n\n687\n00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:43,430\nMac OS and they ported it over to\nvarious Linux distros, and stuff.\n\n688\n00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,350\nSo, you can run in on pretty\nmuch whatever platform you want.\n\n689\n00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:49,730\nAnd what it does is it will\ntake your network adapter and\n\n690\n00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,240\nput it into promiscuous mode.\n\n691\n00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,070\nNow what is that?\n\n692\n00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:57,300\nWell, a normal network adapter\nhas a MAC address attached to it.\n\n693\n00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,590\nAnd if it receives traffic with\na destination MAC address that\n\n694\n00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,480\ndoesn't match its own, it throws it away.\n\n695\n00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,540\nBut with a protocol analyzer,\nyou don't wanna throw it away.\n\n696\n00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,850\nYou wanna receive that data, right?\n\n697\n00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:12,780\nSo, when you fire up Wireshark it'll put\nyour network adapter into promiscuous mode\n\n698\n00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,190\nso that you can receive traffic\ndestined for any MAC address.\n\n699\n00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,340\nAnd then you can gather that data\ntogether and analyze it, right?\n\n700\n00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,180\nSo that's what it does, it puts your\nnetwork adaptor in promiscuous mode and\n\n701\n00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,580\nit starts recording, okay.\n\n702\n00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:28,205\nNow when you start recording your network\ntraffic, you can get a lot of data.\n\n703\n00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:33,000\nIf you're plugging into a switch, you're\nonly gonna see unicasts that are to and\n\n704\n00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,797\nfrom your machine and broadcasts between\nother machines cuz switches won't send\n\n705\n00:34:37,797 --> 00:34:40,319\nyou other people's unicasts by default.\n\n706\n00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:42,003\nThat's why they're so efficient.\n\n707\n00:34:42,003 --> 00:34:45,400\nSo, we might need to combine\nthis with something else.\n\n708\n00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,150\nWe might need to combine it\nwith mirror ports or spans,\n\n709\n00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,720\nswitch port analyzer ports on a switch.\n\n710\n00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,030\nOn a switch, on a high end switch,\n\n711\n00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:59,100\nyou have this ability to mirror\nthe traffic from one port to another.\n\n712\n00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,850\nFor example, let me show you\non a Cisco switch real quick.\n\n713\n00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:10,761\nLet me just get logged in to switch here.\n\n714\n00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:11,561\nAnd here we go.\n\n715\n00:35:11,561 --> 00:35:15,763\nSo, on a Cisco switch we have\nthe monitor session command, all right.\n\n716\n00:35:15,763 --> 00:35:18,643\nThat was to set up\nthe switch port analyzer.\n\n717\n00:35:18,643 --> 00:35:23,229\nAnd what you can do is\nyou can setup a source.\n\n718\n00:35:25,914 --> 00:35:26,820\nOh, that was right.\n\n719\n00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,870\nSo, I'm second guessing my syntax there.\n\n720\n00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,780\nThere we go.\n\n721\n00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,690\nSo, I can say like monitor session 1.\n\n722\n00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:35,590\nSo, that's just creating a monitor,\ncreating a span.\n\n723\n00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:39,930\nAnd I'm saying the source of\nthe traffic will be interface Fa6/2.\n\n724\n00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,160\nAnd I'm going to do both.\n\n725\n00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,930\nI want traffic going into and coming from.\n\n726\n00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,820\nSo, to and from port 6/2.\n\n727\n00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,787\nAll right, and I'm gonna take that traffic\n\n728\n00:35:54,519 --> 00:36:00,610\nAnd I'm gonna send it to a destination,\nwhich will be Fa6/3.\n\n729\n00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:04,150\nOkay, then I can take my laptop,\n\n730\n00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:08,460\nrunning a protocol analyzer,\nand I can plug into port 6/3.\n\n731\n00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:13,350\nAnd when I do that, any traffic to or\nfrom the host plugged into 6/2,\n\n732\n00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:17,280\nmaybe that's one of my servers,\nI'll get a copy of that traffic.\n\n733\n00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,250\nAnd then I can capture\nit with my sniffer and\n\n734\n00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,580\nanalyze it with my protocol analyzer,\nall right.\n\n735\n00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,130\nSo that's pretty important.\n\n736\n00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:27,190\nThat's gonna be needed in\na switch-based environment.\n\n737\n00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,420\nIf you have a hub, right,\n\n738\n00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:32,200\nwhich most people don't anymore,\nyou could plug your laptop into a hub.\n\n739\n00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,080\nAnd then you can plug the host you\nwanna monitor into that hub, and\n\n740\n00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,010\nthen run the hub into your switches or\nwhatever.\n\n741\n00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:41,350\nSo, you're putting yourself in between,\nkinda like a man-in-the-middle attack, so\n\n742\n00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:44,010\nthat you can get in there and\nmonitor that traffic.\n\n743\n00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:47,330\nThe problem with that is that you have to\nunplug the host to plug in the hub, and so\n\n744\n00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,800\nyou get a little bit of downtime.\n\n745\n00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,820\nWith spans like these, with switch ports,\nwhen you do this analyzation,\n\n746\n00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:56,600\nit doesn't take the system offline.\n\n747\n00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,440\nYou can do this in the middle of the day,\nit doesn't affect anything.\n\n748\n00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,720\nSo, that is an example on a Cisco switch.\n\n749\n00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,500\nNow on an HP ProCurve,\nthey call it port mirroring and so\n\n750\n00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,510\nyou have to go into their menus and\nset that up.\n\n751\n00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,480\nCisco calls it switch board analyzer.\n\n752\n00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,630\nDifferent vendors, different names.\n\n753\n00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:15,530\n>> You know Don, in turning this stuff on,\nas far as the other people are aware\n\n754\n00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:20,040\nthat port mirroring is turned on, then\nnobody would really be none the wiser that\n\n755\n00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,260\ntheir traffic is being copied and\nsent out to another port.\n\n756\n00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,250\n>> Yeah, they don't see it at all.\n\n757\n00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,700\nIt doesn't affect performance.\n\n758\n00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,740\nThey don't see a speed decrease or\nanything.\n\n759\n00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,660\nIt's invisible to them, right?\n\n760\n00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,810\nNow, this required me\nto be a network admin,\n\n761\n00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,460\nright, me to get into the switch\nto make that configuration change.\n\n762\n00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,250\nSo, we don't really have to\nworry about attackers doing it\n\n763\n00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,210\nunless they compromise our switch,\nand maybe they could.\n\n764\n00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,240\nAll right.\n\n765\n00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,140\nBut once that traffic is being mirrored,\n\n766\n00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,860\nthen you can fire up\nthat protocol analyzer.\n\n767\n00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,058\nSo, I'm gonna fire up Wireshark,\nall right?\n\n768\n00:37:51,058 --> 00:37:55,790\nAnd I'm gonna go in here and\ntell it to capture my ethernet adapter.\n\n769\n00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,830\nI'll do this one, all right.\n\n770\n00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:01,470\nAnd then as soon as it starts capturing,\nthere it goes.\n\n771\n00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,960\nI'm seeing traffic on my network.\n\n772\n00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,530\nNow, most of the traffic that I'm seeing\nhere is the screen sharing software I'm\n\n773\n00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,930\nrunning on my laptop right now so\nyou guys can see my screen.\n\n774\n00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:13,990\nSo, most of this is me relaying\nthe video of my screen.\n\n775\n00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,070\nAll right.\n\n776\n00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:18,096\nSo we probably need to\napply some filters to it.\n\n777\n00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:21,277\nI'm gonna monitor traffic to\na particular server, all right.\n\n778\n00:38:21,277 --> 00:38:26,875\nAnd I'm already doing a switch port mirror\nfor that one, so I'm getting it's traffic.\n\n779\n00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:30,005\nSo, I'm gonna add a quick\nlittle filter in here\n\n780\n00:38:31,695 --> 00:38:35,295\nto just show me traffic to and\nfrom that one server.\n\n781\n00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:38,800\nHere we go.\n\n782\n00:38:43,383 --> 00:38:44,805\nOkay, so there we go.\n\n783\n00:38:44,805 --> 00:38:47,981\nSo, now, I'm monitoring, and\nI'm only showing traffic to and\n\n784\n00:38:47,981 --> 00:38:51,003\nfrom this one server,\nwhich I don't seem to really have any.\n\n785\n00:38:51,003 --> 00:38:53,116\nLet me see if I can ping\nthat box real quick.\n\n786\n00:38:55,804 --> 00:38:56,400\nAll right.\nSo,\n\n787\n00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,242\nI'm just going to do a quick\nping to that server.\n\n788\n00:38:58,242 --> 00:39:02,131\nAnd notice in the background,\nthere's those pings, right.\n\n789\n00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,934\nI see the ping, the echo request,\nwhere I sent the ping.\n\n790\n00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:08,680\nAnd I see the reply,\nwhere I got a response back.\n\n791\n00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,960\nSo, I sent four pings,\nI should see eight packets total.\n\n792\n00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,180\nI think I actually see nine, don't I?\n\n793\n00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,700\nOh, nope, if my math were better,\nit is eight.\n\n794\n00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:21,610\nSo I see that whole ping communication\ngoing on right there between me and\n\n795\n00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,660\nthat server.\n\n796\n00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,180\nAll right?\n\n797\n00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,218\nAnd that's just me.\n\n798\n00:39:24,218 --> 00:39:25,704\nNate, why don't you ping that one?\n\n799\n00:39:25,704 --> 00:39:28,350\nIt's 10.1.230.60.\n\n800\n00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:28,855\nCan you ping it?\n\n801\n00:39:28,855 --> 00:39:30,980\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n802\n00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,990\n>> And I'm mirroring that port, so\nI'm gonna see that communication,\n\n803\n00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:37,110\neven though it's Nate talking\nto that server and not me.\n\n804\n00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,683\nSo, he's pinging it now.\n\n805\n00:39:39,683 --> 00:39:42,942\n>> Yeah, ping away.\n\n806\n00:39:42,942 --> 00:39:45,430\n10.1.230.60, correct?\n\n807\n00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,809\n>> Yeah.\n>> Apparently, I'm one big fat liar,\n\n808\n00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:47,632\nbecause I didn't get that.\n\n809\n00:39:47,632 --> 00:39:51,369\n[LAUGH] All right, you know what,\nit's doing a live filter, so\n\n810\n00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:53,280\nit may just not have seen it yet.\n\n811\n00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,448\n>> All right, well, anyhow, [LAUGH] or\nI might have set the mirror up wrong.\n\n812\n00:39:57,448 --> 00:40:00,570\nBut it'll reflect it sooner, or later.\n\n813\n00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:03,175\nSo, we'll get that communication in there,\nand we'll see that going on.\n\n814\n00:40:03,175 --> 00:40:05,750\nSo, we can start to monitor that traffic.\n\n815\n00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,060\nImportant part is, it's looking at it.\n\n816\n00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,450\nIt's analyzing it for me.\n\n817\n00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,360\nSee, what it tells me.\n\n818\n00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,630\nThis is an echo ping request,\nor an echo ping reply.\n\n819\n00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,770\nHow did it know that?\n\n820\n00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:20,560\nWell, if you look at the actual packet,\nthis is what it captured, right here.\n\n821\n00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,100\nThat doesn't mean anything to me, right?\n\n822\n00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,446\nI don't know that that's an echo reply.\n\n823\n00:40:24,446 --> 00:40:29,202\nAnd if I look up here, it's actually\nbreaking it down, and saying,\n\n824\n00:40:29,202 --> 00:40:31,011\noh, this has a Type zero.\n\n825\n00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:35,160\nThe type code is set to zero,\nwhich is an echo reply.\n\n826\n00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,840\nOr if I look at the echo request,\nthe type code is set to eight,\n\n827\n00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,750\nthat's a ping request.\n\n828\n00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,210\nI didn't have to know that,\nit figured it out for me.\n\n829\n00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,990\nThat's part of the protocol analysis,\nright?\n\n830\n00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,220\nSo, that's why it's a protocol analyzer.\n\n831\n00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,570\nAnd you'll see, it breaks down the IPv4\nheaders, so I can see the source, and\n\n832\n00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,540\ndestination IPs.\n\n833\n00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,580\nThe layer 2 header, so I can see the MAC\naddress information, source, and\n\n834\n00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,980\ndestination MAC address.\n\n835\n00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,594\nIt's all in there.\n\n836\n00:40:59,594 --> 00:41:03,640\nYou know,\nping is a bad example because it isn't\n\n837\n00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,402\na truly like connection oriented protocol.\n\n838\n00:41:07,402 --> 00:41:10,420\nLet me show you one that builds\na connection, all right?\n\n839\n00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:16,098\nTelnet, you should never use Telnet,\nbecause Telnet is un-encrypted.\n\n840\n00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:19,100\nEverything is sent in plain text.\n\n841\n00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:22,432\nSo, I brought up this Windows server,\nand I turned on the Telnet server on it,\n\n842\n00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,710\njust so I could show you guys.\n\n843\n00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:26,395\nDo I have Telnet installed?\n\n844\n00:41:26,395 --> 00:41:28,404\n[SOUND].\n\n845\n00:41:28,404 --> 00:41:29,246\nNo, let me just PuTTY.\n\n846\n00:41:29,246 --> 00:41:31,490\nI'll fire up PuTTY here.\n\n847\n00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,109\nAnd I'm gonna Telnet to that server.\n\n848\n00:41:35,716 --> 00:41:38,330\nAll right.\nSo, here I am, telneting into it.\n\n849\n00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,510\nAnd I'm gonna log in as administrator,\ncuz I'm going all out.\n\n850\n00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,500\nLittle typo there.\n\n851\n00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,710\nAll right.\n\n852\n00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,010\nAnd I'll punch in my\nsuper secret password,\n\n853\n00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,650\nthat I don't want anybody to know.\n\n854\n00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,080\nCuz if they find out that password,\nthen I'm in real trouble.\n\n855\n00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,780\nRight.\n\n856\n00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,120\nAnd now, I'm in.\n\n857\n00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,154\nI can start to work with the server,\nall right.\n\n858\n00:41:54,154 --> 00:41:56,090\nI can see some information.\n\n859\n00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:00,000\nLet me pull up my server version,\nand you know, how much memory.\n\n860\n00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,266\nIs the mem command gone?\n\n861\n00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:04,976\nAll right, well.\n\n862\n00:42:04,976 --> 00:42:07,152\nWe used to have the mem command, where\nyou could see how much memory you had,\n\n863\n00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:07,670\nstuff like that.\n\n864\n00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:10,631\nSo, I can go [LAUGH] through in,\nand run my various commands,\n\n865\n00:42:10,631 --> 00:42:12,630\nif I can remember any of them.\n\n866\n00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,410\nAnd let me pull up my IP configuration.\n\n867\n00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,490\nSo, I'm working with the server,\nthings are great.\n\n868\n00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:19,180\nI'm done, I hang up.\n\n869\n00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:19,880\nOkay.\n\n870\n00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,440\nWell, I was running a protocol\nanalyzer in the background.\n\n871\n00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,404\nSo, it captured that traffic, and\n\n872\n00:42:24,404 --> 00:42:27,157\nI can see that Telnet\ntraffic laid our right here.\n\n873\n00:42:27,157 --> 00:42:27,737\nRight?\n\n874\n00:42:27,737 --> 00:42:31,708\nAnd so, I can see that Telnet traffic\nwas sent from one side to the other.\n\n875\n00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:36,540\nThe problem is when I look at it down\nhere, it's not very informative, is it?\n\n876\n00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,660\nActually, I do see a little bit, like\nthere, I see the carriage return, /r/n,\n\n877\n00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,720\nand then, it drew the c colon\nslash greater than prompt.\n\n878\n00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,896\nAnd if I were to through and look at each\none of these packets, I can see, oh,\n\n879\n00:42:48,896 --> 00:42:49,498\nI typed e.\n\n880\n00:42:49,498 --> 00:42:50,537\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n881\n00:42:50,537 --> 00:42:52,899\n>> And then, I type, oh,\ne was echoed back to me.\n\n882\n00:42:52,899 --> 00:42:56,381\nAnd then, I type x, and\nthen it was echoed,\n\n883\n00:42:56,381 --> 00:42:58,971\nand then I typed, oh no,\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n884\n00:42:58,971 --> 00:42:59,945\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n885\n00:42:59,945 --> 00:43:00,545\n>> Crashed on me.\n\n886\n00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:01,839\nThat's awesome.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n887\n00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,348\n>> So, let me try that again.\n\n888\n00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:07,042\nSo, anyhow,\nif you were to go packet by packet,\n\n889\n00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:10,303\nyou could find everything that was typed.\n\n890\n00:43:10,303 --> 00:43:13,194\nRight?\nThe problem is that takes a long time,\n\n891\n00:43:13,194 --> 00:43:13,728\nright?\n\n892\n00:43:13,728 --> 00:43:14,772\nAnd that's no fun.\n\n893\n00:43:14,772 --> 00:43:19,381\nSo, let me just get this back.\n\n894\n00:43:19,381 --> 00:43:21,440\nHow lame is that, huh?\n\n895\n00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,711\nIt wouldn't of happened if\nI was running Linux, right?\n\n896\n00:43:23,711 --> 00:43:24,535\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, man.\n\n897\n00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:29,237\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so we'll reapply\nthat and I'll redo my little example.\n\n898\n00:43:29,237 --> 00:43:32,671\nBut one of the nice things about\na protocol analyzer is that\n\n899\n00:43:32,671 --> 00:43:36,920\nit can always go further than what\nyou can with just the naked eye.\n\n900\n00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,050\nSo, when I connect to that server and\nI logged in.\n\n901\n00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,380\nI just cannot type today.\n\n902\n00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:45,410\nThere we go.\n\n903\n00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:49,090\nI took a look at my directory and\nI ran the version command, you know,\n\n904\n00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:51,880\nthat kind of stuff, right?\n\n905\n00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,350\nIt's tracking all that back here,\nand it's recording it.\n\n906\n00:43:55,350 --> 00:44:00,170\nAnd if I take one of those Telnet packets,\nI can right click on it and\n\n907\n00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:04,050\nI can tell it to follow the TCP stream.\n\n908\n00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:07,930\nAnd it will reassemble\nthe traffic that was sent.\n\n909\n00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:09,780\nSo, I'm gonna hit that to follow it.\n\n910\n00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,160\nIt's gonna scan through it and\nreassemble that whole session.\n\n911\n00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,830\nAnd when it's done,\nI see some really interesting stuff.\n\n912\n00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:20,350\nNow, what's in blue is\nwhat the server showed me.\n\n913\n00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:23,040\nWhat's in red is what I sent the server.\n\n914\n00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,248\nSo, when I typed in administrator,\nit echoed it on the screen.\n\n915\n00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:27,854\nRight?\nSo, on the screen,\n\n916\n00:44:27,854 --> 00:44:29,699\nI saw each letter as I typed it.\n\n917\n00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:32,640\nWhen I typed the password,\nit didn't show it on the screen.\n\n918\n00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,140\nRight?\n\n919\n00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:36,866\nBut I did type it and\nhere it is, plain as day.\n\n920\n00:44:36,866 --> 00:44:38,549\nThat's my password.\n\n921\n00:44:38,549 --> 00:44:39,147\nRight?\n\n922\n00:44:39,147 --> 00:44:41,724\nCapital p-a-$-$-w-0-r-d.\n\n923\n00:44:41,724 --> 00:44:43,199\nNow everybody knows, right?\n\n924\n00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:45,650\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> It's the password on this junk server.\n\n925\n00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:49,890\nSo, I can see that password\nin plain text right there.\n\n926\n00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:53,900\nNot only that, as I work,\nI typed D-I-R and\n\n927\n00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,040\nthen, here's the directory\nlisting that I got back.\n\n928\n00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,650\nRight?\n\n929\n00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:00,350\nAnd then,\nI ran V-E-R to pull up the version.\n\n930\n00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:03,010\nAnd I type exit and\nit's all been reassembled.\n\n931\n00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:06,945\nAnd if the red is distracting to me, I can\nalways come in here and say, you know,\n\n932\n00:45:06,945 --> 00:45:08,455\njust show me one way.\n\n933\n00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:12,355\nI'll just cut that out and now,\nI just see it nice and clean like that.\n\n934\n00:45:12,355 --> 00:45:14,415\nThis is what was echoed on the screen.\n\n935\n00:45:14,415 --> 00:45:15,688\nNow, I've got a recording of\nthat whole communication.\n\n936\n00:45:15,688 --> 00:45:16,489\nAll right?\n\n937\n00:45:16,489 --> 00:45:22,755\nThat's why it's so important that\nwe encrypt our data on the network.\n\n938\n00:45:22,755 --> 00:45:27,840\nAnd if your protocol doesn't support it,\nlike if you have to use Telnet,\n\n939\n00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,490\nthen combine it with IPsec, right?\n\n940\n00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:33,280\nUse IPsec to encrypt everything that's\ncoming out of your machine and then,\n\n941\n00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,370\nTelnet will just get encrypted\nright along with IPsec.\n\n942\n00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:38,460\nSo, you know, those are some of\nthe different techniques we've got there.\n\n943\n00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,895\nBut by running a protocol analyzer.\n\n944\n00:45:40,895 --> 00:45:43,835\nBy scanning your own network, right?\n\n945\n00:45:43,835 --> 00:45:46,995\nEspecially scanning the port\nthat goes to your router, right?\n\n946\n00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:48,488\nAll the traffic that's going into and\n\n947\n00:45:48,488 --> 00:45:50,452\nout of your network is\ngoing through your router.\n\n948\n00:45:50,452 --> 00:45:55,227\nIf you can analyze that network and gather\nan hours worth of data, it can be quite\n\n949\n00:45:55,227 --> 00:46:00,160\na bit of data, you can then analyze and\nlook, is there un-encrypted traffic?\n\n950\n00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,530\nIs there traffic, you know,\n\n951\n00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:04,230\nfrom various hosts that's\nexceeding that of other hosts?\n\n952\n00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,630\nRight?\nWe can go up here\n\n953\n00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:06,730\ninto our conversation list.\n\n954\n00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:11,780\nIf you go to statistics and conversations,\n\n955\n00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:15,240\nit's gonna analyze all that and\nshow me who are my top talkers.\n\n956\n00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,230\nWho's sending the most data.\n\n957\n00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:18,570\nAnd so, it can break that down and\n\n958\n00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:21,870\nshow me the communications\nthat are the greatest, right?\n\n959\n00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:26,488\nSo, it's gonna be my laptop, in this case,\nbut, or actually, you know what?\n\n960\n00:46:26,488 --> 00:46:30,174\n10.1.230.56, 10.1.230.57.\n\n961\n00:46:30,174 --> 00:46:32,885\nAren't you 56?\n\n962\n00:46:32,885 --> 00:46:34,750\n>> I don't know who I am.\n\n963\n00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,470\n>> It might be your laptop or my laptop.\n\n964\n00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,300\nOr that TriCaster here.\n\n965\n00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,140\nSo, anyhow, we can start to see who it is.\n\n966\n00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,485\nWho are those top talkers.\n\n967\n00:46:41,485 --> 00:46:45,050\nWho's communicating the most, and\nyou can start to look at that.\n\n968\n00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:48,990\nThere's all sorts of valuable\ninformation inside of here, right?\n\n969\n00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:54,270\nAnd this software, well, Wireshark,\nin particular, is free but you can use\n\n970\n00:46:54,270 --> 00:47:00,660\nSniffer Pro from Network General,\nMicrosoft network monitor is another one.\n\n971\n00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,460\nThe flop network inspectors,\nthose things are awesome.\n\n972\n00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,880\nThey cost several thousand dollars.\n\n973\n00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,050\nThey're hardware sniffers and analyzers.\n\n974\n00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:10,580\nYou can plug them up to see all\nsorts of good stuff with them, too.\n\n975\n00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:13,010\nWho else has it?\n\n976\n00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:16,694\nThere's several others.\n\n977\n00:47:16,694 --> 00:47:20,787\nThe network inspector, who you makes\nthat thing, well, anyhow, whatever.\n\n978\n00:47:20,787 --> 00:47:23,440\nSo, anyhow, there's a bunch of\ndifferent devices out there.\n\n979\n00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,500\nThey all work basically the same way,\n\n980\n00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,070\nthough they give you\nreally good information.\n\n981\n00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:26,620\nAnd I'll tell you,\n\n982\n00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:30,170\nas somebody who's worked with these over\na long time, Wireshark's pretty awesome.\n\n983\n00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:32,870\nYou know, I find myself using\nWireshark more often than not, just\n\n984\n00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:37,370\nbecause I don't wanna deal with adding my\nlicense file to the software, you know.\n\n985\n00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:40,010\nThis is just free, it runs,\ndoes everything that I need.\n\n986\n00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:42,150\nSo, definitely cool software.\n\n987\n00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,270\nBig thing to remember though is how\nswitches interact with it, right.\n\n988\n00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:50,360\nCuz a switch won't send you unit cast for\nsomebody elses traffic, so\n\n989\n00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:55,289\nyou've got to use a mirror port if\nyou're gonna be using a switch.\n\n990\n00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,568\nAll right, couple other things\nthey call out, let's see.\n\n991\n00:47:58,568 --> 00:48:01,260\nHoneypots and honeynets, all right.\n\n992\n00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:05,997\nThis is another one, when an attacker is\nperforming a reconnaissance attack on\n\n993\n00:48:05,997 --> 00:48:10,510\nyour network, when they're just\ntrying to find out what's there.\n\n994\n00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,470\nRight?\n\n995\n00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:14,230\nThey don't necessarily know\nwhat those servers do.\n\n996\n00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,340\nAnd so one of the little\ntricks of the trade we can use\n\n997\n00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,850\nis what's called security\nthrough obscurity.\n\n998\n00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:20,380\nRight?\n\n999\n00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:24,110\nWe can make our network more obscure,\nwe can hide our servers.\n\n1000\n00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,830\nAnd we can do that by\ncreating fake servers.\n\n1001\n00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:30,940\nSo there are honey pots, which are fake\nservers that we intentionally set up,\n\n1002\n00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,120\nthat are weaker than our other servers.\n\n1003\n00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:38,190\nThat have a lot of non-secured\nservices turned on, but also have\n\n1004\n00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:42,700\ntheir logging ratcheted up to the highest\nlevels all the way to the roof, right?\n\n1005\n00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,620\nAnd when an attacker scans your network,\n\n1006\n00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:48,630\nwhen they see that weak server, that draws\nthem in, that attracts them like honey.\n\n1007\n00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,150\nThat's where that name comes from.\n\n1008\n00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:54,080\nIt draws them in, because they say,\nthat's a server I know I can break into.\n\n1009\n00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,880\nThen they break into it, and\nthey start wandering around.\n\n1010\n00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,180\nMeanwhile, you are logging all of this.\n\n1011\n00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:03,880\nSo now when you decide to litigate,\ntake them to court or whatever.\n\n1012\n00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,410\nYou've got all the evidence you need.\n\n1013\n00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:06,620\nYou can submit that.\n\n1014\n00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:09,320\nAnd it was done without effecting\none of your production servers,\n\n1015\n00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,170\none of your main servers.\n\n1016\n00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,215\nYou can also do a honeynet.\n\n1017\n00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:17,860\nHoneynets, you can buy these appliances\nwhere what they do is they basically look\n\n1018\n00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:21,630\nat your network and they look For\nIP address that aren't in use.\n\n1019\n00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:26,750\nAnd it takes any IP that's not in use,\nand it creates a fake server on that IP.\n\n1020\n00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,330\nAnd now when somebody scans your network,\n\n1021\n00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:31,680\nthey'll get a positive hit on\nevery single port on your network.\n\n1022\n00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,130\nAnd then, all of those servers are really\njust point towards one fake server.\n\n1023\n00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:38,410\nWhich again,\nhas logging turned up through the roof.\n\n1024\n00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:43,140\nThere's a few companies that make\nHoneynet appliances out there.\n\n1025\n00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:47,800\nLet me see if I can find anybody\nthat I can remember offhand.\n\n1026\n00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:54,500\nWell, see that's like a,\nwell I'm not gonna search around too much.\n\n1027\n00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,460\nBut there are several different\ncompanies out there that make\n\n1028\n00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,619\nthese appliances that do it.\n\n1029\n00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:00,190\nHoneDrive?\n\n1030\n00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:02,070\nI haven't heard of that one.\n\n1031\n00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:04,010\nSounds positive though.\n\n1032\n00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:05,210\nSo you can find them.\n\n1033\n00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,705\nOne of the most famous ones is\nactually borderline illegal.\n\n1034\n00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:12,340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's one called LaBrea and\n\n1035\n00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,530\nI've used it in the past, just\n\n1036\n00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:21,270\nchange that search a little bit otherwise\na lot of historical information about LA.\n\n1037\n00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:22,510\nHere we go.\nLaBrea.\n\n1038\n00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:24,830\nSo LaBrea is a very old project.\n\n1039\n00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:25,900\nIt's been around a long time.\n\n1040\n00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,870\nAnd I say it's borderline illegal.\n\n1041\n00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:30,510\nWhen you have somebody\nattacking your network,\n\n1042\n00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:33,900\nit can be tempting to take\ncountermeasures, right?\n\n1043\n00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,620\nTo attack back.\n\n1044\n00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:37,500\nBut that's not legal, right?\n\n1045\n00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,560\nJust because somebody's attacking your\nnetwork does not give you the right to\n\n1046\n00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:44,160\nattack theirs, and you'll get in\nthe same trouble that they'll get in.\n\n1047\n00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:44,830\nAll right.\n\n1048\n00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:50,200\nWell, LaBrea it kind of went a step\nfurther than just being a honeypot.\n\n1049\n00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:54,050\nWhat it did, it would take over all\nthe the unused IP's on your network.\n\n1050\n00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:56,060\nAnd when an attacker\nwould hit the system and\n\n1051\n00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:01,150\nstart to do a PNG sweep, it would send\nthe PNG reply or the PNG request.\n\n1052\n00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:03,940\nAnd LaBrea instead of sending a PNG reply,\n\n1053\n00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,200\nwould send back a network\ncongestion message.\n\n1054\n00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,612\nIt would say the networks congested,\nwait a minute and then reach back to me.\n\n1055\n00:51:10,612 --> 00:51:12,150\nAll right.\n\n1056\n00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:16,190\nAnd that would make the attackers machine\nwait, and then it would re-transmit back.\n\n1057\n00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:18,560\nAnd LaBrea would do another\ncongestion messages.\n\n1058\n00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,800\nThey know,\nwait a little bit longer, right?\n\n1059\n00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,530\nMeanwhile the attacker's trying\nto scan all of theses IP's and\n\n1060\n00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:25,630\nconstantly getting these\nweight messages back.\n\n1061\n00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:29,310\nAnd what it would do is it would fill up\nthe network card buffer of the attacking\n\n1062\n00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:32,160\nmachine and it would make it where they\ncouldn't talk on the network anymore.\n\n1063\n00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,230\nYou've effectively shut down the attacker.\n\n1064\n00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:37,070\nAll right, now it didn't do any\nlasting damage, and it would\n\n1065\n00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:40,380\ntime after a few minutes or whenever\nthey'd stop their stupid attack anyway.\n\n1066\n00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:43,980\nAnd so it's not like you hurt them,\nbut because it's a countermeasure,\n\n1067\n00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:44,710\nit's frowned upon.\n\n1068\n00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:46,920\nAnd so I don't believe this is\nactively developed anymore.\n\n1069\n00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,885\nI think they cut it off awhile ago.\n\n1070\n00:51:48,885 --> 00:51:50,913\nLets see.\n\n1071\n00:51:50,913 --> 00:51:57,230\nI'm just kind of curious to see\nwhat the latest version is.\n\n1072\n00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:58,740\nI imagine it's fairly old.\n\n1073\n00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,950\nYeah 2003, it's over 10 years ago.\n\n1074\n00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,780\nSo it hasn't been updated in a long time.\n\n1075\n00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,760\nAnd that's because it got\ninto this legal gray area.\n\n1076\n00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,490\nThere are plenty of ones out there,\nthat are on the up and up.\n\n1077\n00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:09,520\nThat don't do a countermeasure.\n\n1078\n00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:13,320\nThat just give false report that say hey,\nI'm a server that's up.\n\n1079\n00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,630\nYou could build your own.\n\n1080\n00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:17,040\nYou could build your own Linux box or\nwhatever, and\n\n1081\n00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,730\njust set it up to be very weak.\n\n1082\n00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:21,930\nThe problem is if somebody compromises it\nthey could then use it as a jumping point\n\n1083\n00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,850\nto attack other internal servers.\n\n1084\n00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:27,700\nSo your honeypot servers need to be\nhardened at least to a certain point\n\n1085\n00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:30,370\nto stop them from reaching out and\nattacking other systems.\n\n1086\n00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:34,350\nSo you do have to be careful on that.\n\n1087\n00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:38,330\nAll right, well looking at the clock Nate,\nit's about time for us to take a break so\n\n1088\n00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:38,930\nlet's do this.\n\n1089\n00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,470\nLet's stop.\nAnd during the break I'll find that.\n\n1090\n00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:43,950\nI know there's a company cuz I've\nworked with their appliance before.\n\n1091\n00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:46,690\nI just can't remember the name,\nthat makes a Honeypot appliance.\n\n1092\n00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:48,520\nAnd it's really cool so I wanna show that.\n\n1093\n00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,880\nI'll find it during the break.\n\n1094\n00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,837\nSo let's stop here and we'll pick back up.\n\n1095\n00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:55,195\nIn a few.\n\n1096\n00:52:55,195 --> 00:52:58,405\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n1097\n00:52:58,405 --> 00:53:03,120\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n1098\n00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,100\nSo I searched during the break to try and\n\n1099\n00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:08,170\nfind the company that made this\nappliance I was looking for.\n\n1100\n00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:10,360\nI couldn't find them, so\nthey may not be around any more.\n\n1101\n00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,140\nWell, I found another company so\nthis one will do.\n\n1102\n00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,527\nSo this is a company\ncalled Security Extreme.\n\n1103\n00:53:14,527 --> 00:53:16,790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And they make appliances.\n\n1104\n00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:19,550\nWell, one called the honeyBox,\nso this is appropriate.\n\n1105\n00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:20,370\nAnd basically,\n\n1106\n00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:23,620\nwhat it is just a hardware appliance\nthat creates these virtual servers.\n\n1107\n00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:27,100\nNow, you might ask yourself,\nwhy not just use virtual servers?\n\n1108\n00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,750\nAnd it goes back to what I said\nat the end of the last segment.\n\n1109\n00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:33,880\nThat is, that you need to make sure\nthese machines are secured and\n\n1110\n00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,170\nhardened themselves because\nthey will get broken into.\n\n1111\n00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:40,960\nAnd when they do you don't want\nthe attacker to then leapfrog attacks into\n\n1112\n00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:41,990\nyour network.\n\n1113\n00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:46,310\nSo what these guys do is they\nmake an appliance, the memory for\n\n1114\n00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:50,140\nit or the storage for it is readable only.\n\n1115\n00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,130\nSo you can't actually\nmodifier what's there.\n\n1116\n00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:53,010\nWhich is nice.\n\n1117\n00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,770\nThe attacker won't have that access.\n\n1118\n00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:59,210\nAnd then it can emulate any\nof the number of things.\n\n1119\n00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:02,370\nIt can emulate routers,\nHP printers servers,\n\n1120\n00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:07,740\nMAC OS, Solaris, Linux, SUSE Linux,\nVM Linux, Windows servers.\n\n1121\n00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,670\nIt can emulate all sorts of\ndifferent types of servers.\n\n1122\n00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:14,170\nAnd by emulate, I just mean it's giving\noff the footprint for that server.\n\n1123\n00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:15,870\nAnd you can even do mixes of these.\n\n1124\n00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:22,370\nAnd then on each server, it emulates\na number of different services, and\n\n1125\n00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:28,075\nlet me, can I zoom in this a little\nbit to kind of tiny, there we go.\n\n1126\n00:54:28,075 --> 00:54:31,270\nAnd so you’ll see things like echo for\nthe PNG requests.\n\n1127\n00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:35,060\nYou’ve got FTP, SSH,\nTelnet, SMTP, POP3, IMAP.\n\n1128\n00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,290\nAll the high visibility ones.\n\n1129\n00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:42,600\nThe ones that people are looking for\nand it can even do generic TCP.\n\n1130\n00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,980\nYou can add your own port to it if\nyou wanted to do SQL or whatever.\n\n1131\n00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,880\nAnd that's just to draw people in.\n\n1132\n00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,840\nThey do that port scan and\nthey hit these virtual machines,\n\n1133\n00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:54,630\nthe machines that don't really exist and\nthey see this traffic.\n\n1134\n00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:57,390\nNow the appliance is really just\ncreating one super machine.\n\n1135\n00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:00,060\nBut it is showing up on all\nthese different IP's and\n\n1136\n00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:03,690\nreflecting itself as different systems\nbased on the IP people come in.\n\n1137\n00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:05,540\nIt's really neat stuff.\n\n1138\n00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,850\nAnd so then the attacker gets in there.\n\n1139\n00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:11,840\nOnce the attacker is in all\nthe data is recorded and\n\n1140\n00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:16,270\nis being sent to a separate station you\nmaintain, that is maintaining those logs.\n\n1141\n00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:19,680\nSo if the attacker finds some way to flush\nthe log, it shouldn't be possible, but\n\n1142\n00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,160\nif it is,\nyou've already got that back up copy.\n\n1143\n00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,410\nYou've got it stored somewhere else and\nyou can use it.\n\n1144\n00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:27,780\nSo they've got all that\nright there in the hardware,\n\n1145\n00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,120\nthey then have a software appliance for\nthe management side.\n\n1146\n00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,980\nThat's where you'll have your recorder and\nall that running.\n\n1147\n00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:35,750\nBut it's pretty neat stuff and\nit's all in an appliance piece.\n\n1148\n00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,710\nSo that makes it really convenient.\n\n1149\n00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:39,460\nI haven't worked with\nthis one specifically.\n\n1150\n00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:43,240\nBut I've worked with one's from other\nvendors whose name escapes me because\n\n1151\n00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,692\napparently I can't\nremember things anymore.\n\n1152\n00:55:44,692 --> 00:55:46,850\nBut that's kinda the idea.\n\n1153\n00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:51,339\nAnd you can build your own there is\nthat honeyDrive project was one of\n\n1154\n00:55:51,339 --> 00:55:54,899\nthe top google responses\nthat came back a minute ago.\n\n1155\n00:55:54,899 --> 00:55:59,384\nBut you will see where people have made\nsoftware packages that do basically\n\n1156\n00:55:59,384 --> 00:56:02,310\nthe same thing but\nwithout the appliance piece.\n\n1157\n00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:04,751\nSo- You know, you can always\ntake a look at stuff like that.\n\n1158\n00:56:04,751 --> 00:56:09,313\nThey're really useful and it creates\nthat security through obscurity.\n\n1159\n00:56:09,313 --> 00:56:12,141\nThe attackers will go for\nthe path of least resistance, so\n\n1160\n00:56:12,141 --> 00:56:16,590\nthey're drawn to these boxes instead\nof going to your production system.\n\n1161\n00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,920\n>> You know and it got all five stars.\n\n1162\n00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,465\nIt got the yeah five stars.\n\n1163\n00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,930\nWith four reviews.\n\n1164\n00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:25,502\n>> With four reviews so\nit was definitely worth while.\n\n1165\n00:56:25,502 --> 00:56:30,120\n[LAUGH] Well the last update was only\ndays ago though so that's a good sign.\n\n1166\n00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,720\nSo it is actively developed.\n\n1167\n00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:32,270\nAll right.\n\n1168\n00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:35,110\nSo, so those are honeypots and honeynets.\n\n1169\n00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:36,920\nNow, a honeynet normally\ngoes a step further and\n\n1170\n00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,850\ncreates an entire separate network.\n\n1171\n00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:42,530\nYou might have a fake DMZ that,\nyou know, once the attacker is in there,\n\n1172\n00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:43,960\nthe whole network is fake.\n\n1173\n00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,650\nSo you know,\nthese are fake servers anyway,\n\n1174\n00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:47,450\nit's not like it's costing\nyou money to do it.\n\n1175\n00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:49,380\nSo you can do that pretty easily.\n\n1176\n00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:52,900\nAnd again, it just makes it harder for the\nattackers to find the production systems.\n\n1177\n00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:57,300\nIt is not a substitute for\nsecuring your production systems though.\n\n1178\n00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,740\nBut if you've secured your production\nsystem to do things like respond to a PNG,\n\n1179\n00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:05,560\nwhen the attacker does the PNG sweep\nthey'll see all the honeypots.\n\n1180\n00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,400\nAnd your production servers won't respond.\n\n1181\n00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,950\nSo they won't know the production servers\nare there unless they've actively gone and\n\n1182\n00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:12,460\nsought those IPs out.\n\n1183\n00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:15,390\nSo that's some of\nthe ways that we can kind\n\n1184\n00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,513\nof help to improve\nsecurity on our network.\n\n1185\n00:57:18,513 --> 00:57:21,630\nAll right, so those are the tools.\n\n1186\n00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:22,930\nThe tools of the trade, right?\n\n1187\n00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:26,330\nThose are all the different things that\nwe can use when we do vulnerability and\n\n1188\n00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:27,610\npenetration testing.\n\n1189\n00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:28,240\nAll right.\n\n1190\n00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,590\nSo let's talk about the testing itself.\n\n1191\n00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:32,100\nI already mentioned\nthe vulnerability scanning.\n\n1192\n00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,050\nThat's normally what we do inside\nof our network is we look at\n\n1193\n00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:39,430\nour machine to identify vulnerabilities\nand that's what Compte calls out,\n\n1194\n00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:40,270\nsome of the different things.\n\n1195\n00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:43,430\nWe already talked about passive\nversus active scanning.\n\n1196\n00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:45,720\nWhat are some of the other things here?\n\n1197\n00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:47,410\nYou saw the objectives?\n\n1198\n00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:52,270\n>> Let's bring those up and jump down\nto 3.8 All right., scan on down there.\n\n1199\n00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:54,270\n>> There we go.\n\n1200\n00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:56,940\nSo, you'll see under vulnerability\nscanning where they're saying what\n\n1201\n00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,100\nyou're trying to do.\n\n1202\n00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,660\nIdentify the vulnerabilities, right?\n\n1203\n00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:02,400\nLook out there on the network and\nsee what weaknesses you have.\n\n1204\n00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,090\nIdentify common misconfigurations, right?\n\n1205\n00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:07,520\nMaybe it's not a known exploit.\n\n1206\n00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:11,090\nMaybe it's just somewhere where you've\nconfigured something improperly.\n\n1207\n00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:13,800\nI mentioned FTP servers that use FTPS,\n\n1208\n00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,160\nwhere if encryption fails they\ndrop back to regular FTP.\n\n1209\n00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,040\nThat's terrible.\n\n1210\n00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,650\nMaybe there's an option in there you\ncan configure to change that [COUGH].\n\n1211\n00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:22,910\nSo take advantage of that stuff.\n\n1212\n00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:25,198\nLook for it, try and\nfind it before the attackers do.\n\n1213\n00:58:25,198 --> 00:58:28,760\nIntrusive versus non-intrusive.\n\n1214\n00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,244\nRight?\nThe difference there is whether or\n\n1215\n00:58:31,244 --> 00:58:34,980\nnot you actively try to\nexploit the vulnerability.\n\n1216\n00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:39,460\nIf you're using Metasploit,\nIts initial scan is non-intrusive.\n\n1217\n00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:41,190\nIt doesn't actually exploit the machines.\n\n1218\n00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:43,230\nIt just sees that the exploit is there.\n\n1219\n00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:45,670\nBut then you can tell it,\nhey, go ahead and exploit it.\n\n1220\n00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:47,960\nGo ahead and try and\ntake advantage of it, right.\n\n1221\n00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,160\nThat's intrusive.\n\n1222\n00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,400\nIt's good to see if it actually works, but\n\n1223\n00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,030\nit can make changes to your production\nsystems, and that can be bad.\n\n1224\n00:58:55,030 --> 00:59:00,580\nSo you may want to not do that, right?\n\n1225\n00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:06,510\nIt reminds me, a long time ago,\nthere was an exploit for\n\n1226\n00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:10,930\nWindows and Microsoft, they used to call\nall their server products Back Office.\n\n1227\n00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:14,040\nAnd so there was\nthe Microsoft Back Office Sequel Server,\n\n1228\n00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,030\nMicrosoft Back Office Exchange Server,\nand so on.\n\n1229\n00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:18,330\nThat was what they called everything,\nBack Office.\n\n1230\n00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:21,500\nAnd so there was this exploit\nit was called back orifice.\n\n1231\n00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,060\nAnd [LAUGH] it's a funny name and\n\n1232\n00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,160\nwhat it would do is it would allow\nfull remote control of your server.\n\n1233\n00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,410\nYou could see the screen\nthey can access the command.\n\n1234\n00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:31,420\nThey could do everything remotely.\n\n1235\n00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:35,810\nAnd for a solid year the security experts\nthat were out there all said the same\n\n1236\n00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:40,620\nthing they said hey this is a really\nbad thing to get on your system.\n\n1237\n00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:44,430\nThe best way to prevent it,\nis to install it yourself.\n\n1238\n00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:47,220\nIf you put it there first,\nand you control it,\n\n1239\n00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:49,710\nthen an attacker can't\nput it there afterwards.\n\n1240\n00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:52,760\nNow, in today's world that's terrible\nadvice [LAUGH] don't do that.\n\n1241\n00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,220\nBut that was what they\nsaid back then was like,\n\n1242\n00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:56,190\nhey go ahead and,\ninstall the exploit yourself and\n\n1243\n00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:59,330\njust make sure you got it set to your\ninformation so you can control it.\n\n1244\n00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:00,520\nThat's intrusive.\n\n1245\n01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:05,060\nYou're making a change to your system,\nand, it's hard to measure what you've\n\n1246\n01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:09,810\ndone, you've just deviated from your\nvendor specifications on that system.\n\n1247\n01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:13,470\nFuture updates might break, future\nexploits might happen that only apply to\n\n1248\n01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:16,680\nyour system and not the rest of the world,\nso you don't hear about them.\n\n1249\n01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,790\nThat's the danger with\ndoing something like that.\n\n1250\n01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:24,360\nSo, you know, just because a security\nexpert said to do it on the Internet,\n\n1251\n01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,760\ndoesn't necessarily mean you\nshould believe it, right?\n\n1252\n01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,780\nAlways take that with a grain of salt or\ngrain of sand.\n\n1253\n01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:30,610\nWhat, grain of salt?\n\n1254\n01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:32,610\n>> Yeah, salt.\n>> Whatever the saying is I'm looking for.\n\n1255\n01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:36,570\nBut the person to trust on a lot of\nthis stuff is the vendor themselves.\n\n1256\n01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:37,230\nThe vendors knows.\n\n1257\n01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:39,320\nThey know how to secure their systems.\n\n1258\n01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,892\nI almost feel dumb saying that.\n\n1259\n01:00:40,892 --> 01:00:42,190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1260\n01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:44,528\nThat's the way it's supposed to be.\n\n1261\n01:00:44,528 --> 01:00:51,390\n[LAUGH] All right, we also have\ncredentialed versus non-credentialed.\n\n1262\n01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:55,770\nWhen you're scanning for vulnerabilities,\nif you have credentials, in other words,\n\n1263\n01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:59,560\na valid user account, then you can\nscan and access the system and\n\n1264\n01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,210\ndo all sorts of stuff.\n\n1265\n01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:04,420\nBut if you didn't have a valid user\naccount and you ran those same scans,\n\n1266\n01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:04,980\nthey might fail.\n\n1267\n01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:06,380\nAll right?\n\n1268\n01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:08,930\nSo, does that mean we want to\nrun it without credentials,\n\n1269\n01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:10,510\ncuz the attackers won't have credentials?\n\n1270\n01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:11,530\nWell, you can.\n\n1271\n01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:15,890\nBut if you want a really thorough scan,\nthat gives you even beyond\n\n1272\n01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:19,610\nwhat the attacker's initially going to\nhave, then you'll do it credentialed.\n\n1273\n01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:23,100\nAll right, because it just\ntakes a few phone calls for\n\n1274\n01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:26,630\nan attacker to socially engineer\nsomebody and get an account.\n\n1275\n01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:29,180\nAnd, once they have an account,\nwhat damage can they do from there?\n\n1276\n01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:30,790\nRight?\nMaybe they can VPN it in now,\n\n1277\n01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:32,720\nbecause they have a valid username and\npassword.\n\n1278\n01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,460\nAnd, once they've VPN'd in,\nthey're behind your firewall, and so now,\n\n1279\n01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:38,410\nthey're inside your network\nwith a valid user account.\n\n1280\n01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:42,190\nThat's why vulnerability scans need to\nbe done on the inside, and credentialed.\n\n1281\n01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:44,680\nRight.\n\n1282\n01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,960\nThat last little entry is\nthe important one to remember, though.\n\n1283\n01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,090\nFalse positives.\n\n1284\n01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:52,230\nWhen you scan your network, your scan is\nonly as good as the software you use to do\n\n1285\n01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:54,980\nthe scan and\nsome of them can generate false positives.\n\n1286\n01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:58,570\nThey can show there are weaknesses\nthere that isn't necessarily present.\n\n1287\n01:01:58,570 --> 01:01:59,560\nSo, be aware of that.\n\n1288\n01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,200\nMake sure you read the documentation.\n\n1289\n01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,900\nLike, when I had, you know,\nmy little scanner running earlier.\n\n1290\n01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:08,350\nIt gave me information, links to articles\nto find out more about that exploit.\n\n1291\n01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:12,670\nSo I might need to read up on it\nto see if it is, truly vulnerable.\n\n1292\n01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:15,790\nYou know, a great example, we had this\nhappen with the IT Pro TV website.\n\n1293\n01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:19,290\nWe started getting tickets from\npeople saying, hey, your website.\n\n1294\n01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:22,050\nIt's still vulnerable to Heart Bleed.\n\n1295\n01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:23,120\nAnd I don't wanna log in.\n\n1296\n01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:25,070\nI don't wanna put credit\ncard information on there.\n\n1297\n01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:29,180\nAnd, so I had to email each of those\npeople and let them know, hey, I'm sorry.\n\n1298\n01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:31,480\nThe scanner you're using\nis not very reliable.\n\n1299\n01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:32,500\nIt was the one from.\n\n1300\n01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:34,010\nOh shoot, what is it?\n\n1301\n01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:34,820\nSSL Reports?\n\n1302\n01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:36,270\n>> SSL Labs.\n\n1303\n01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:36,790\n>> SSL Labs.\n\n1304\n01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:37,400\nThat's what it was.\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n1305\n01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,340\n>> Yeah, SSL Labs.\n\n1306\n01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:39,620\nThat, people who should know better.\n\n1307\n01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:43,220\nTheir own scanner wasn't catching\nthings that were back patched.\n\n1308\n01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:45,800\nSo when, when heart bleed came out and\n\n1309\n01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,830\na new version of open SSH didn't\ncome out that day, right?\n\n1310\n01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:52,960\nIt came out days later, the,\nthe, version that, or not.\n\n1311\n01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,870\nNot open SSH, open SSL.\n\n1312\n01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:56,810\nWhen the new version came out,\nit was days.\n\n1313\n01:02:56,810 --> 01:03:00,360\nWell, a lot of people needed to patch\nit early, and so they back patched.\n\n1314\n01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:04,060\nAnd when you back patch, the version\nnumber of the, the library doesn't change,\n\n1315\n01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:07,500\nand that's all that SSL Labs was\nlooking at was the version number.\n\n1316\n01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,230\nSo they weren't actually\ntesting the exploit,\n\n1317\n01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:11,140\nthey were just checking\nthe version number.\n\n1318\n01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:15,880\nNow in our scenario it was even funnier\nbecause we weren't using open SSL.\n\n1319\n01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,020\nWe had a load balancer\nin place that used a,\n\n1320\n01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:21,340\na private library that wasn't\nSusceptible to heart bleed.\n\n1321\n01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:22,340\nI tested it myself.\n\n1322\n01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,310\nIt didn't work.\n\n1323\n01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:28,110\nAnd so, you know,\nSSL Labs was failing us improperly, right?\n\n1324\n01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:29,620\nSo, that happens.\n\n1325\n01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:33,650\nYou get false positives, and it's because\nsecurity scans are very difficult.\n\n1326\n01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:37,630\nAnd that's why we don't want to\njust do passive scans you know\n\n1327\n01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:38,890\nthe non-intrusive stuff.\n\n1328\n01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:42,590\nBeing able to test the exploit using\nsomething like metaploit to actually\n\n1329\n01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:43,570\ntry the exploit and\n\n1330\n01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:47,460\nsee if works, that's the only way if\nyou truly know if you are vulnerable.\n\n1331\n01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:51,482\nIf the exploit truly works and heart bleed\nwas a great example of that and today,\n\n1332\n01:03:51,482 --> 01:03:55,463\nit's been a few months now since heart\nbleed broke and that was such a big deal.\n\n1333\n01:03:55,463 --> 01:03:57,828\nToday, if you go to those same scanners,\n\n1334\n01:03:57,828 --> 01:04:00,882\nalmost all of them have a note\nat the bottom that says.\n\n1335\n01:04:00,882 --> 01:04:03,292\nResults may not be accurate,\nblah, blah, blah, right?\n\n1336\n01:04:03,292 --> 01:04:07,324\nBut that didn't matter, and the first week\nafter that exploit, people took that and\n\n1337\n01:04:07,324 --> 01:04:08,892\nsaid, these test are accurate,\n\n1338\n01:04:08,892 --> 01:04:11,250\nnot realizing how poorly\nbuilt most of them were.\n\n1339\n01:04:12,612 --> 01:04:17,910\n>> Yeah, well Don, now that, we're doing\nsome scanning here, that, we've got our\n\n1340\n01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:21,490\nintrusive scans or non-intrusive scans,\nand credentialed and non-credentialed.\n\n1341\n01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:25,580\nNow some of these scans, they can fall\nunder different types of scanning and\n\n1342\n01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:28,570\nComt does call out three different ones,\nright?\n\n1343\n01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:32,110\nSo, we got black box, white box,\nand grey box, different\n\n1344\n01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:36,300\ntypes of scanning that we can do, based\non what kind of information that we have.\n\n1345\n01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,380\n>> I mentioned earlier you might\nnot want to do the scan yourself.\n\n1346\n01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:43,170\nYou might want to hire somebody\nfrom the outside yourself to do it.\n\n1347\n01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,988\nIf you do that,\nif you hire somebody from the outside,\n\n1348\n01:04:45,988 --> 01:04:49,869\nthey're normally going to give you\nthree different quotes for the price.\n\n1349\n01:04:49,869 --> 01:04:54,326\nAnd it's going to be based on whether\nyou want to do a white box scan,\n\n1350\n01:04:54,326 --> 01:04:56,673\na gray box scan or a black box scan and\n\n1351\n01:04:56,673 --> 01:05:01,620\nit all comes down to how much information\nyou give them about your network.\n\n1352\n01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:08,350\nA black box scan is the most common and\nthat's where you give them no information.\n\n1353\n01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:08,960\nAll right?\n\n1354\n01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:13,770\nYou tell them, hey, I want you to scan\nmy network, I work for Don Pezzetco and\n\n1355\n01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:15,660\nI want you to check out my website,\n\n1356\n01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:20,620\nit's don pezzetco.com and\nI want you to run a scan and that's it.\n\n1357\n01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:21,220\nThat's all you give me.\n\n1358\n01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:22,800\nYou just tell them the site.\n\n1359\n01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,840\nTry and break in and\nsee what you can do, okay?\n\n1360\n01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:30,720\nWell, with absolutely no information,\nthey'll have to do a reconnaissance scan.\n\n1361\n01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,700\nThey'll have to try and get in.\n\n1362\n01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,640\nThey'll have to try and\nget user credentials.\n\n1363\n01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:37,420\nThey're acting like a true outsider,\na true attacker out there on the Internet,\n\n1364\n01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:39,600\nhaving to learn everything\nto get into your site.\n\n1365\n01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,660\nThose are very difficult attacks\nto pull off, and so they,\n\n1366\n01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:44,440\nthey usually charge the most for those.\n\n1367\n01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,810\nBut it's the most realistic\ncompared to an attacker.\n\n1368\n01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:51,840\nBut the problem is all the high visibility\n\n1369\n01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:55,000\nexploits that you guys have heard\nabout over the last few years, right?\n\n1370\n01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,938\nWhat are some of the big security\nleaks we've heard, right?\n\n1371\n01:05:57,938 --> 01:06:03,550\nWell,there's the whole shoot, I already\nforgot his name, Bradley Manning, right?\n\n1372\n01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:05,670\nWith the WikiLeaks, the Pentagon leaks.\n\n1373\n01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,460\nRight?\nAnd then more recently,\n\n1374\n01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:11,860\nwe have the Edward Snowden,\nwith the CIA leaks, right?\n\n1375\n01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:12,570\nOr NSA leaks?\n\n1376\n01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:13,620\nNSA leaks.\n\n1377\n01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:17,510\nSo, were these guys outsiders\nwith no information?\n\n1378\n01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:21,360\nNo, these were insiders with\nall the information, all right?\n\n1379\n01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,730\nThat's a white box attack.\n\n1380\n01:06:22,730 --> 01:06:25,680\nA white box attack, is or scan or\n\n1381\n01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,790\nwhatever, is where you\nhave all the information.\n\n1382\n01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:32,590\nYou have a valid used account, you know\nthe IP addresses of the servers, and\n\n1383\n01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:33,520\nyou see if you can get in.\n\n1384\n01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,950\nOf course, for an employee,\nthey're gonna be able to get in.\n\n1385\n01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:39,530\nSo if you bring in this outside\ncontractor to scan system,\n\n1386\n01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:41,480\nyou give them full information.\n\n1387\n01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:45,617\nYou give them network diagrams, you\ngive them any information they ask for,\n\n1388\n01:06:45,617 --> 01:06:48,420\nyou give it to them and\nthey find out what's wrong.\n\n1389\n01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:49,890\nNow, these attach, or\n\n1390\n01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:53,630\nthese scans are easier cuz they've\nalready got the information, right?\n\n1391\n01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:55,860\nBut they're usually far more beneficial,\n\n1392\n01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:58,650\nbecause they will find all sorts\nof weaknesses and exploits that\n\n1393\n01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:02,420\nthey might not have found if they were\ndoing the outside, uninformed attack.\n\n1394\n01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:03,470\nAll right.\n\n1395\n01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:07,510\nAnd then the gray box scan,\nor gray box test,\n\n1396\n01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:10,500\nwhatever, these are technically\ntesting methods.\n\n1397\n01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:12,430\nLet's go official here just so\neverybody knows.\n\n1398\n01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:14,420\nThese are officially\ncalled testing methods.\n\n1399\n01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:17,380\nWe'll call them attacks and\nscans and so on.\n\n1400\n01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:19,680\nBut on the exam you'll most\nlikely see them called tests.\n\n1401\n01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,680\nA white box test, a gray box test,\na black box test.\n\n1402\n01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,040\nSo, with the gray box test,\n\n1403\n01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:28,890\nwith this one what we're doing\nis we are kind of in between.\n\n1404\n01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:31,550\nWe have some information\nabout the network.\n\n1405\n01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:36,560\nWe have some idea of the servers\nthat are in place but not in depth.\n\n1406\n01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,130\nSo it's just in between a white and\na black.\n\n1407\n01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:44,210\nOftentimes, if you're a big company\nhandling really sensitive information,\n\n1408\n01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:45,800\nyou'll do all three, right.\n\n1409\n01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,980\nSo you'll bring in an outside contractor\nand you'll tell them, all right,\n\n1410\n01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:51,150\nstage one, do a black box test.\n\n1411\n01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,530\nI'm not giving you any information\nsee if you can get in.\n\n1412\n01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:54,250\nAll right.\n\n1413\n01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:55,882\nStage two, we'll do grey box.\n\n1414\n01:07:55,882 --> 01:07:57,760\nI'm gonna give you a little\nbit more information.\n\n1415\n01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,010\nThe type of stuff an attacker might\nfind out after a day of scanning, and\n\n1416\n01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,590\nnow you can try.\n\n1417\n01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:04,030\nThen day three, we'll go white box.\n\n1418\n01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:05,580\nWe'll give you full documentation.\n\n1419\n01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:09,300\nYou can now spend a week working on\nour network, seeing what you can find.\n\n1420\n01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:13,090\nThat gives you a full security\naudit of your environment, and\n\n1421\n01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:15,820\nyou can determine what\nyou need to address.\n\n1422\n01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:18,330\n>> Now, let's say that on that your\n\n1423\n01:08:18,330 --> 01:08:21,760\nguys are performing some scans\non a production network.\n\n1424\n01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:26,930\nI would say typically these would be\nnon-intrusive type scans on a production\n\n1425\n01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:30,920\nnetwork because, I mean you don't want\nanyone to bring your servers down or\n\n1426\n01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,120\nstart to install some\nof these root kits and\n\n1427\n01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,920\nsome of these things on your\nproduction network, right?\n\n1428\n01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,410\n>> Well typically you don't.\n\n1429\n01:08:37,410 --> 01:08:40,100\nEspecially when it comes\nto installing root kits.\n\n1430\n01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:45,450\nBut if you schedule this for a downtime\nperiod, and not every company has that,\n\n1431\n01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:47,610\nbut if you can schedule it for\na downtime period you should.\n\n1432\n01:08:47,610 --> 01:08:49,480\nYou should go ahead and\nlet them try to break in.\n\n1433\n01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:52,330\nAnd then you'll have to restore\nyour servers afterwards, but\n\n1434\n01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:54,820\nif that's part of your\nplan then you cover that.\n\n1435\n01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:59,030\nBut, if you're a 24/7 shop,\nthen you may not have that option, right?\n\n1436\n01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:02,540\nSo what you can do is you can clone your\nservers and have them attack a clone.\n\n1437\n01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:05,660\nRight, that's one of the easier\nways to go about it.\n\n1438\n01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:07,720\nTake like IT Pro TV, right?\n\n1439\n01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,850\nWe've got our production servers, the\nservers that you the viewer are on right\n\n1440\n01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:12,940\nnow, right, that's our production server.\n\n1441\n01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:15,620\nBut we also have what are called\nour staging servers, and\n\n1442\n01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:20,010\nthe staging servers it's an exact\nmirror of our production server.\n\n1443\n01:09:20,010 --> 01:09:22,220\nThe production and\nstaging environment are the same.\n\n1444\n01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:24,160\nWe have a third environment\ncalled our dev environment.\n\n1445\n01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:24,930\nAnd that one's different.\n\n1446\n01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:28,290\nThat one's the one where the developers\nare working, adding stuff, whatever.\n\n1447\n01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:31,770\nSo, if we wanted to do a full\npenetration test, we could attack\n\n1448\n01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:35,040\nthe staging environment knowing that\nit's a mirror of our production.\n\n1449\n01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:38,540\nSomething works in staging it'll work in\nproduction, and so there's your test and\n\n1450\n01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:41,470\nat the end of the day,\nyou blow away the staging environment, and\n\n1451\n01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:42,880\nmirror it back from production again.\n\n1452\n01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,240\nSo that's what the bigger\nenterprise type environments do.\n\n1453\n01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:51,840\nYou should have multiple\ncopies of these same systems.\n\n1454\n01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:52,800\n>> Nice.\n\n1455\n01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,290\n>> At the insurance company I worked at,\n\n1456\n01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:58,970\nthe key mission critical software was\nthis document imaging suite that we used.\n\n1457\n01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:01,530\nAnd we had five different environments for\nit.\n\n1458\n01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:04,910\nThere was the sandbox environment\nwhere the developers played around,\n\n1459\n01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:07,730\nthere was the dev environment where\nthe developers actually did their work,\n\n1460\n01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:11,970\nthere was the Q-A environment, where the\nquality assurance team did their testing,\n\n1461\n01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:14,670\nthen there was the staging environment\nwhich was a mirror of production,\n\n1462\n01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:16,200\nand there was production.\n\n1463\n01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:19,680\nSo there were actually five instances,\ntwo of which,\n\n1464\n01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,740\nproduction and staging were mirrored.\n\n1465\n01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:23,640\nRight?\n\n1466\n01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:24,840\nBut then Dev and QA,\n\n1467\n01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:28,950\nwhich were also mirrored between each\nother were pretty close to production.\n\n1468\n01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:32,780\nSo you could pen test\nagainst any of those and,\n\n1469\n01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:35,182\nit would really give you a reflection of,\nof what you'd see in production.\n\n1470\n01:10:35,182 --> 01:10:37,650\nSo, yeah.\n\n1471\n01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:41,332\nAnd you have to, as a home user it's kind\nof shocking to hear things like that.\n\n1472\n01:10:41,332 --> 01:10:43,790\nYou're like I'm not gonna maintain\nfive copies of the same system.\n\n1473\n01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:47,040\nIt's a giant waste, but when you're\na multi-million dollar company and\n\n1474\n01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:51,040\nyour business depends upon that software.\n\n1475\n01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:51,856\nYou'll get five environments.\n\n1476\n01:10:51,856 --> 01:10:55,070\n[LAUGH] You'll build as many environments\nas you need to make sure that your system\n\n1477\n01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:56,270\nis stable and secure.\n\n1478\n01:10:58,150 --> 01:10:58,800\n>> Nice.\n\n1479\n01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:04,300\n>> The only other thing I want to point\nout is they do mention a few things like\n\n1480\n01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:08,840\nexploiting the vulnerabilities we talked\nabout, actively testing security controls.\n\n1481\n01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,380\nWe've been talking about it from\na perspective of the technology.\n\n1482\n01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:14,460\nThere's the physical side of things.\n\n1483\n01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:14,970\nRight?\n\n1484\n01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:18,180\nIf you've got a security guard,\ncheck in through the night and\n\n1485\n01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:20,640\nsee if the security guard\nis actually patrolling.\n\n1486\n01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,820\nRight?\nIf they're sitting up at the front desk\n\n1487\n01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:26,480\nwith their feet on the desk watching tv,\nthey're not monitoring the building and so\n\n1488\n01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,340\nwhile you've got the security\ncontrol there, it's not effective,\n\n1489\n01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:31,900\nit's not working the way it's supposed to.\n\n1490\n01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:34,830\nSo check on that, check on your cameras,\n\n1491\n01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:37,660\ncheck to make sure doors are being\nlocked at the end of the day.\n\n1492\n01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:42,420\nYou've got to make sure that your security\ncontrols are being used properly.\n\n1493\n01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:47,360\nAnd then the other thing is,\nverify a threat exists.\n\n1494\n01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,380\nThat's the verbage right\nfrom the objectives.\n\n1495\n01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:54,510\nWhat that means is,\njust because there's a vulnerability,\n\n1496\n01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:56,290\ndoesn't mean there's a threat.\n\n1497\n01:11:56,290 --> 01:12:01,520\nYou may have a weakness, like the fact\nthat SSL security keys can be compromised.\n\n1498\n01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,350\nThe private keys can be calculated.\n\n1499\n01:12:03,350 --> 01:12:05,870\nBut there's not really a threat,\n\n1500\n01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:09,420\nbecause it would take millions\nof years to do, right?\n\n1501\n01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:12,660\nSo because of that,\nwe don't necessarily need to take action.\n\n1502\n01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:15,205\nI don't need to throw away\nmy 2,048 bit keys today.\n\n1503\n01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:17,690\n[LAUGH] I got time, right we can wait.\n\n1504\n01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:22,800\nBut there's other areas where there\nmight be a very valid threat, and\n\n1505\n01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,950\nthose are the ones that\nwe need to address first.\n\n1506\n01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:27,850\nDoesn't mean to ignore the ones\nthat don't have threats, but\n\n1507\n01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:32,860\nthe ones that have threats those need to\nbe addressed today, right now, right?\n\n1508\n01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:37,190\nBecause if you don't address them,\nyour attackers will.\n\n1509\n01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:39,920\n>> So, then Don, so\nlike actively test security controls and\n\n1510\n01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:40,560\nthose sorts of things.\n\n1511\n01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,820\nWould you say that could also\nkind of apply back in with our\n\n1512\n01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:45,860\nmonitoring stuff, right?\n\n1513\n01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:50,300\nSo we have to check our logs, maybe\nmonitor that security guard, making sure\n\n1514\n01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:54,450\nhe is making our rounds and so everything\nkind of does come back full circle.\n\n1515\n01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:58,240\nWhere we implement some of these controls\nthen we need to check our controls and\n\n1516\n01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:59,130\ntest our controls.\n\n1517\n01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:03,840\nMake sure everything is working as\nopposed to just letting one go unchecked\n\n1518\n01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,980\nthen your information can\npossibly get out there.\n\n1519\n01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:10,280\n>> Yeah, the old adage is that\nnetwork security is like a chain.\n\n1520\n01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:12,890\nIt's only as strong as\nthe weakest link and so\n\n1521\n01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:16,560\nif you got one weak system,\nthat gets compromised and\n\n1522\n01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,370\nit becomes the launching point for attacks\nthroughout the rest of your network.\n\n1523\n01:13:20,370 --> 01:13:22,560\nSo it just takes one system\nbeing compromised and\n\n1524\n01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,920\nthen you're in real trouble.\n\n1525\n01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:28,242\nRight, all of a sudden you've got a\ncompromise as big as Target, so whatever.\n\n1526\n01:13:28,242 --> 01:13:30,240\nSo that's where it kinda leads to.\n\n1527\n01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,170\nAll right.\n\n1528\n01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:31,860\nAll right, well, Nate,\n\n1529\n01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:37,040\nI think that pretty much covers it as far\nas vulnerability and threat scanning.\n\n1530\n01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,630\n>> Let me scan over the objectives.\n\n1531\n01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:40,100\nI don't think we've missed anything.\n\n1532\n01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:41,060\n>> Right no.\n\n1533\n01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:42,657\nThat's pretty good.\n\n1534\n01:13:42,657 --> 01:13:45,745\nAll right well this is a pretty\ngood spot to wrap it up then.\n\n1535\n01:13:45,745 --> 01:13:49,845\nLet me remind everybody that if you\nhave any questions on this stuff,\n\n1536\n01:13:49,845 --> 01:13:50,795\nfeel free to ask.\n\n1537\n01:13:50,795 --> 01:13:53,465\nLive during the show you\ncan go to itpro.tv/live.\n\n1538\n01:13:53,465 --> 01:13:55,755\nYou'll see the chat box beneath the video.\n\n1539\n01:13:55,755

00:00:20,160\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today\nwe're taking that CompTIA Security Plus.\n\n4\n00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,960\nAnd what we're really focusing in on with\nwhat we're talking about here is gonna be\n\n5\n00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,200\nwireless attacks.\n\n6\n00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,990\nAnd wireless attacks are actually\nprevalent today, and\n\n7\n00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,390\nthey're something we've\ngotta look out for.\n\n8\n00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,426\nBut who else better to help us\nout than Mr. Wes Bryant, Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:33,426 --> 00:00:35,300\nCompTIA security himself.\n\n10\n00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,977\nSo Wes, let's talk just briefly here\nabout what's so important about wireless\n\n11\n00:00:38,977 --> 00:00:41,749\nsecurity and why do we have to\nworry about wireless attacks.\n\n12\n00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:42,795\n>> Yeah, most definitely.\n\n13\n00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:47,060\nYou know, today,\nyou know in most modern networking.\n\n14\n00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,290\nIt's almost unheard of to find\nlack of a wireless device,\n\n15\n00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,012\nyou know when wireless\nnetworks first came out.\n\n16\n00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:57,820\nIt was, something that was revolutionary\nand hey, you got a wireless device.\n\n17\n00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,330\nWell.\ntoday you're almost considered\n\n18\n00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,660\nthe oddball out if you don't\nhave a wireless device and\n\n19\n00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,300\nwe've got a lot of different\nplatforms out there.\n\n20\n00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,876\nInternet of things is out there,\nso it's just increasing more.\n\n21\n00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:11,935\nWe've got things like BYOD scenarios\nwhere you have little devices,\n\n22\n00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:15,610\nmaybe like this, that go on networks,\nconnect to networks.\n\n23\n00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,900\nYou have gaming consoles, right?\n\n24\n00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,740\nWe have TVs,\nall different Kinds of devices.\n\n25\n00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,180\nAnd that's just exponentially growing so\n\n26\n00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,240\nreally Ronny, when it comes down to it,\nthat's one the reasons you have to be\n\n27\n00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,580\nfamiliar with some of the vulnerabilities\nthat you might be susceptible to.\n\n28\n00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,150\nAnd more specifically the attacks that\nwill exploit those vulnerabilities when we\n\n29\n00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:35,920\nlook at wireless networking.\n\n30\n00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,020\n>> We do actually have to consider the\nvery fact that with wireless networking,\n\n31\n00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,880\nwhat really makes a difference and\nwhy we have to actually be more on top of\n\n32\n00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,210\nthe situation Is that\nunlike a wired network,\n\n33\n00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,020\nwhere really it's about tapping\ninto that physical network itself,\n\n34\n00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,830\nwireless networks of course won't\nuse a media that we call of course\n\n35\n00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,030\nunbounded media, radio frequency,\nradio wave, whatever you wanna call them.\n\n36\n00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,700\nAnd that means it's much more\ndifficult to keep them confined.\n\n37\n00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,270\nIn other words if I wanna send\nyou a message from A to B,\n\n38\n00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,150\nit doesn't mean it doesn't\ngo out anywhere else.\n\n39\n00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,400\nYou may still receive receive it,\nbut the signal still goes somewhere.\n\n40\n00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,800\nAnd that's really the key here.\n\n41\n00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,210\nAnd so wireless security is something\nthat we've got to be aware of.\n\n42\n00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,860\nBecause if we are not that\nmeans anybody can actually\n\n43\n00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,480\npull off an attack on just that.\n\n44\n00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,090\nThe very fact that\nthe signal goes everywhere.\n\n45\n00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,940\nAnd it means that we\nactually have to be careful.\n\n46\n00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,420\nThe good thing is,\nwhat we as IT professionals need\n\n47\n00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,190\nto be able to do is to identify a lot\nof these different types of attacks.\n\n48\n00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,110\nAnd Wes is not only going\nto be able to identify,\n\n49\n00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,660\nhe's also even going to show us\nhow to do some of these attacks.\n\n50\n00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,440\nAnd we'll put that strange\ncaveat in there right.\n\n51\n00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,360\nDo not do this at home,\nor actually I should say,\n\n52\n00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,210\ndon't do this on networks you're\nnot supposed to do it on.\n\n53\n00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:39,940\nLet's put it that way.\n\n54\n00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,220\n>> Yeah, that's the big disclaimer.\n\n55\n00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,770\nSome of the things that we are gonna see\nhere, guys, I've got wireless access,\n\n56\n00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,700\nwe've got wireless access points here.\n\n57\n00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,290\nWe own them.\n\n58\n00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,680\nIt's nobody else's network,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n59\n00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,564\nAnd Ronnie's absolutely right.\n\n60\n00:02:51,564 --> 00:02:55,278\nWhen you look at it, I mean, wireless\nsignal, think about it, radiated Energy.\n\n61\n00:02:55,278 --> 00:02:59,375\nThere is always some kind of communication\nthat's emanating between these devices,\n\n62\n00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,014\nwhether it's a centralized\ndevice like an access point\n\n63\n00:03:02,014 --> 00:03:05,900\nthat's managing all of the devices on\nthe network, or if the device themselves.\n\n64\n00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,090\nYou turn that wireless signal on, and\nwhether you're communicating or not,\n\n65\n00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,220\nin the background you got things\nlike control, beacons, and\n\n66\n00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,750\nmanagement frames that are just going\nto be sent across the network, so\n\n67\n00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,680\nit's important to understand that.\n\n68\n00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,470\nOne of the first attacks that I'd like\nto talk to you about is the concept of\n\n69\n00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,040\nwar driving.\n\n70\n00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,020\nNow, when we talk about war driving,\n\n71\n00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,470\nunderstand that the basics here is\nthe mode of transportation can differ.\n\n72\n00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,790\nThe theory and concept is the same.\n\n73\n00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,880\nYou're looking for open access points.\n\n74\n00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,650\nRight, if you think about the WiFi\nhotspots that are around,\n\n75\n00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,910\nyou probably connected\nto one of these before.\n\n76\n00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,500\nRight, you go into your\nfavorite place to eat,\n\n77\n00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,300\nyou go into a coffee shop, you sit down.\n\n78\n00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,530\nIt says, free WiFi, right.\n\n79\n00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,716\nJust go ahead and come on in and connect.\n\n80\n00:03:45,716 --> 00:03:49,370\nWell, attackers love that concept.\n\n81\n00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,408\nThey love something open that\nthey can connect to, and\n\n82\n00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:56,853\nmaybe piggy back off of your network to\nlaunch an attack against somebody else.\n\n83\n00:03:56,853 --> 00:03:58,455\nBut it doesn't have to stop there.\n\n84\n00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:02,330\nIt could be more complex,\nthey could do more complex attacks.\n\n85\n00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,220\nSo, when we talk about war driving, again,\n\n86\n00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,770\nwar driving's no more than\njust searching around.\n\n87\n00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,430\nAnd your mode of transportation is,\nyou're probably in some vehicle, and\n\n88\n00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,810\nyou're looking for\nopen access points to try to connect to.\n\n89\n00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,702\nThey have other different forms too.\n\n90\n00:04:15,702 --> 00:04:18,850\nI've heard the term war walking,\nwar flying, right and you might say,\n\n91\n00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,970\nwell war flying,\nthat's something that's kinda interesting.\n\n92\n00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,180\nI found the access point, we passed it.\n\n93\n00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,390\nI found the access point, we passed it.\n\n94\n00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,670\nBut you got to think today we've\ngot things like drones, right,\n\n95\n00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,370\ndrones are becoming prevalent.\n\n96\n00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,750\nSo the mode of transportation is\nreally the only thing that differs.\n\n97\n00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,500\nWhen it comes down to it Ronny\nultimately its going to be searching for\n\n98\n00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,770\nthose open access points and\n\n99\n00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,520\nthan when you find them, you potentially\nstart to mount an attack from there.\n\n100\n00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,647\n>> You know and this is where you see\nwhere movies have really popularized\n\n101\n00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:46,449\nthe idea of being able\nto move from car and\n\n102\n00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:48,570\nthen of course picking\nup an open access point.\n\n103\n00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,832\nIt's not unrealistic but of course it's\nmore glamorized in that situation where\n\n104\n00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:57,031\na lot of times in true war driving you're\njust trying to find any open access point\n\n105\n00:04:57,031 --> 00:05:00,450\nand most of the time when you do\nfind access points it's amazing.\n\n106\n00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,220\nYou find a whole list of them but\nmost of them are gonna be secured.\n\n107\n00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,240\nYou're really searching for\nthat open one and normally an attacker,\n\n108\n00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,220\nwhat he's gonna do of course,\nis take advantage of\n\n109\n00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,850\nthat situation in which it's not about\nthe idea of bypassing security so much.\n\n110\n00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,620\nIt's about the idea of them being able\nto stumble upon an open one and taking\n\n111\n00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,290\nadvantage of the signal that's right there\nat that one particular point in time.\n\n112\n00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,930\nSo they can launch an attack to them and\n\n113\n00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,950\nthe reason why this makes it actually\nsomething we've got to worry about\n\n114\n00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,270\nis because remember that\nif they launch an attack.\n\n115\n00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,780\nSo, Wes has got one let's\nsay at this house, and\n\n116\n00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,880\nhe just says I leave it open all the time.\n\n117\n00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,570\nAnd now an attack comes through from\nWes' into whatever business it might be,\n\n118\n00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,110\nwell the problem is the last\nplace they're actually\n\n119\n00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,060\ngoing to be able to identify\nis going to be where Wes is.\n\n120\n00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,650\n>> Yeah, you've got to be careful\nwith that, that's for sure.\n\n121\n00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,973\nRemember, an open network or a wireless\nnetwork, even if it's a closed network,\n\n122\n00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:52,259\nyou're responsible for the information,\n\n123\n00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,182\nwhatever activities happen\non your wireless network.\n\n124\n00:05:55,182 --> 00:05:58,569\nNow, when you think about it,\nyou might say well, what's so\n\n125\n00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:00,860\nbig about leaving an open access point.\n\n126\n00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,290\nWell, I want you to think about this.\n\n127\n00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:06,000\nYou've got all your belongings,\neverything that's precious to you,\n\n128\n00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,600\nsitting in your house right now.\n\n129\n00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,610\nWhat I'd like you to do is open all\nthe windows, open all the doors and\n\n130\n00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,400\nleave for two days.\n\n131\n00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:19,170\nNow, don't really do that but that's the\nsame concept of leaving an open network.\n\n132\n00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,840\nNow, the next thing we talk about is\ndirectly associated with war driving or\n\n133\n00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,760\nwar walking.\n\n134\n00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,630\nWhat happens when you find\nthat open access point, right?\n\n135\n00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,920\nYou find that open network.\n\n136\n00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,060\nWell, a lot of the hackers, and\n\n137\n00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,200\nit doesn't necessarily have to be hackers,\nit could be somebody that's just curious.\n\n138\n00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,670\nWhen they find these locations,\nthey make a little symbol on the ground or\n\n139\n00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,240\nI've even seen them on\nthe side of a wall too.\n\n140\n00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,160\nI lived in New Hampshire there.\n\n141\n00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,170\nAnd on the side of the brick building,\nsomebody must have got clever, and said,\n\n142\n00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,880\nif you stand right here at\nthe corner of this building,\n\n143\n00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,260\nyou can connect to the access point,\nso you might see them on the ground.\n\n144\n00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,171\nBut commonly, they call it war chalking,\nyou'll see some kind symbol on the ground\n\n145\n00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:59,130\nthat let's you know, hey, if I've got my\nwireless phone, or if I've got a tablet.\n\n146\n00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,648\nIf I've got another device and\nI stand right here in this location,\n\n147\n00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:04,139\nI should be able to connect.\n\n148\n00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,246\nSo kind of like a not really cryptic\nin nature, but if you know what you're\n\n149\n00:07:08,246 --> 00:07:12,156\nlooking for, then you can recognize\nthose symbols, and you know that\n\n150\n00:07:12,156 --> 00:07:16,620\nif you stand right here, well that's step\ntwo of maybe leading into an attack.\n\n151\n00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,170\nFirst, I found you.\n\n152\n00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,160\nAnd now I know where to stand so\nthat I can gain access to your network so\n\n153\n00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,470\nwe gotta watch that as well.\n\n154\n00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,530\nAnd, Ronnie, I tell you that's\nusually complimentary to some kind\n\n155\n00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,480\nof war driving attack.\n\n156\n00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,500\nOr war walking attack if you're strolling\ncasually down maybe a college area and\n\n157\n00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,280\nyou maybe got your phone and you're\nlooking out for wireless access points.\n\n158\n00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,120\nWhen you do find them, you put some\nkind of symbol on the ground that lets\n\n159\n00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,460\nother people know that might\nme doing the same thing.\n\n160\n00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,540\nStand in this location and\nyou can connect to that access point.\n\n161\n00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,231\n>> Well and you think about it, right?\n\n162\n00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:47,501\nPeople think that they're being courteous,\nbut even though they might, may be,\n\n163\n00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:51,405\nwhere the person inside doesn't really\nmind that the access point is open,\n\n164\n00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:54,765\nthe problem is that it actually\nmakes it easier for the attacker.\n\n165\n00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:58,214\nInstead of having to drive around All\nthey have to do is actually look for\n\n166\n00:07:58,214 --> 00:08:02,194\nthe symbol and instead of actually having\nto find whether or not a network come in.\n\n167\n00:08:02,194 --> 00:08:05,244\nUsually those symbols\ninclude either circles or\n\n168\n00:08:05,244 --> 00:08:10,560\nopen kinda looking parentheses and they\nnormally include the SSID name in them.\n\n169\n00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,170\nLetting you know what type of open access\npoint is actually available inside of\n\n170\n00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,190\nthem as well.\n\n171\n00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,060\nSo a lot of times you'll see that.\n\n172\n00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,980\nAnd even though they claim that these are\nlike universal types of symbols sometimes\n\n173\n00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,727\nthey are, sometimes they aren't.\n\n174\n00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:25,059\nIt really depends on who's doing what\nat what particular point in time.\n\n175\n00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:26,267\n>> Sure, how basic is it?\n\n176\n00:08:26,267 --> 00:08:27,521\nIs it not an attack?\n\n177\n00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:30,650\nSomething basic like that\nit might be just a symbol.\n\n178\n00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,550\nBut if it's like Ronnie said somebody\nthat's a little bit more savvy behind\n\n179\n00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,110\nthe wheel of whatever that\ndevice is that's connected.\n\n180\n00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,150\nThey put things like that SSID,\nthat network name there.\n\n181\n00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,170\nNow we're going a little bit farther,\nwe're not just putting a symbol there.\n\n182\n00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,493\nThey're kinda broadcasting what your\nnetwork is and how to connect to it.\n\n183\n00:08:44,493 --> 00:08:49,970\nSo, you really have to watch\nit because it's easy to do.\n\n184\n00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,780\nAll your network adapters that\nare connecting to wireless networks\n\n185\n00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,310\nare constantly searching for networks,\neven if they're already connected to one.\n\n186\n00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,170\nI'm sure you guys have probably seen it\nout there when you've opened your wireless\n\n187\n00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,900\ndevice and\nit says available wireless networks.\n\n188\n00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,023\nWell how is it populating that list?\n\n189\n00:09:03,023 --> 00:09:04,764\nYou're already connected,\nwhy do I have a list?\n\n190\n00:09:04,764 --> 00:09:06,447\nI'm already connected to a network.\n\n191\n00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:09,815\nWell that's because in the background,\nyour access point or\n\n192\n00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:14,167\nactually your network adapter is sending\nout what are known as STA to AP probes.\n\n193\n00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:17,440\nI'm sending little station message\nthat says, who's out there?\n\n194\n00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,755\nAnd the access point it's listening\nout for that kinda information.\n\n195\n00:09:20,755 --> 00:09:24,200\nIt says right back to your network\nadapter it says, here I am,\n\n196\n00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,605\nthis is my network name.\n\n197\n00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:29,279\nNow that doesn't mean that you can connect\nto it, but you got to keep in mind that,\n\n198\n00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,584\nlike Ronnie mentioned earlier that\ninformation is always imminenting,\n\n199\n00:09:32,584 --> 00:09:35,059\nwhen we're talking about\nwireless communications.\n\n200\n00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:38,971\nAnd the only way you can turn it off, is\nto literally turn on the network adapters,\n\n201\n00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:42,338\nand for wireless communications,\nthat might slow us up a little bit.\n\n202\n00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:46,056\n>> Now Wes, I also understand that what we\ncan do with these wireless access points\n\n203\n00:09:46,056 --> 00:09:48,178\nas well,\nis do what we call packet sniffing.\n\n204\n00:09:48,178 --> 00:09:51,066\nThe idea of packet sniffing though,\ntell us a little bit more about that in\n\n205\n00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:54,250\na little bit, and then you're gonna\nactually show us an example, aren't you?\n\n206\n00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,317\n>> Definitely.\n\n207\n00:09:55,317 --> 00:09:58,745\nSo, when we located our access point,\nwe found our access point,\n\n208\n00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:02,433\nwe know that's it's open,\nwhat's the next thing we're going to do?\n\n209\n00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:05,975\nI want you to think of it like\na collection agency for your data.\n\n210\n00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:10,537\nPacket sniffing is the ability\nto grab the information.\n\n211\n00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:14,370\nTo see the information\nthat is on your network.\n\n212\n00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,540\nAnd if we take a look here, there's\na couple different ways that we can do it.\n\n213\n00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,350\nWe can do this from\nthe command line interface.\n\n214\n00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:22,760\nWe can do this as well from\nthe graphical user interface.\n\n215\n00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,910\nBut one of the things that you have\nto do to ensure that you can do this,\n\n216\n00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,770\nis you have to change the default\nnature of your network adapter.\n\n217\n00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:34,830\nSee, wireless network adapters, they're\nset in what's known as manage mode.\n\n218\n00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,660\nAnd manage mode means\nthey're gonna ask for\n\n219\n00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,340\nthe connectivity device, the access point.\n\n220\n00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,670\nThey're gonna connect to it.\n\n221\n00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,802\nThey're gonna ask the access\npoint to manage you.\n\n222\n00:10:43,802 --> 00:10:46,290\nAll right.\nBut when we do packet sniffing,\n\n223\n00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,680\nwe don't want to be managed.\n\n224\n00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,854\nWe want to find all\nthe information that's out there.\n\n225\n00:10:49,854 --> 00:10:51,187\nSo let's go ahead and\n\n226\n00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:55,937\ncheck how you can change the way your\nnetwork adapters default setting are.\n\n227\n00:10:55,937 --> 00:10:58,770\nSo, what I have here, are I have Kali.\n\n228\n00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,844\nLet me go ahead and just log in here,\nkinda locked on me in the background,\n\n229\n00:11:02,844 --> 00:11:03,517\nall right.\n\n230\n00:11:03,517 --> 00:11:04,935\nAnd I have a terminal open.\n\n231\n00:11:04,935 --> 00:11:08,773\nNow, inside of your wireless\nconfiguration, and we're gonna,\n\n232\n00:11:08,773 --> 00:11:12,074\nRonnie, I'm gonna challenge\nmy ability to type today.\n\n233\n00:11:12,074 --> 00:11:13,513\nI can tell you that.\n\n234\n00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:16,149\nI can see right here that\nthe mode says managed.\n\n235\n00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:17,112\nRight?\n\n236\n00:11:17,112 --> 00:11:21,652\nThat's telling me that my\nwireless adapter is looking for\n\n237\n00:11:21,652 --> 00:11:25,366\nan access point,\npotentially, to manage it.\n\n238\n00:11:25,366 --> 00:11:27,073\nWell, that's not gonna\nhelp me capture traffic.\n\n239\n00:11:27,073 --> 00:11:28,015\nRight?\n\n240\n00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:30,260\nCuz I'm only gonna see\nthe information that's coming to and\n\n241\n00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,330\nfrom my network adapter\nupon its initiation or\n\n242\n00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:38,460\nbehind a broadcast communication that's\ngonna go to everybody regardless.\n\n243\n00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,530\nSo, what we're gonna do here is we're\ngonna change it up a little bit.\n\n244\n00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,490\nAll right, first thing that we have\nto do is, we're gonna go ahead, and\n\n245\n00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,586\nthere are some services in\nthe background that are running.\n\n246\n00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:52,300\nAnd they don't like to play nice when\nyou're doing what's known as putting your\n\n247\n00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,739\nnetwork adapter into promiscuous mode.\n\n248\n00:11:54,739 --> 00:11:57,885\nNow, promiscuous mode, you might\nhave heard it called ad hoc mode,\n\n249\n00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,905\nthat means I'm gonna capture everything.\n\n250\n00:11:59,905 --> 00:12:03,167\nNot just the stuff that's coming to me,\nbut everything in the area, right?\n\n251\n00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:04,781\nThat's what Ronnie said packet sniffing.\n\n252\n00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:08,681\nSo we're gonna do the collection\nagency of all the information here.\n\n253\n00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:13,221\nSo the next thing that we'll do here is,\nwe'll actually, let's check again, right?\n\n254\n00:12:13,221 --> 00:12:17,177\nSo we've got our adapter set up and\n\n255\n00:12:17,177 --> 00:12:22,224\none of the things that I can see,\nyou got to\n\n256\n00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:27,558\nstart it first, so\nlet's do our airmon -ng.\n\n257\n00:12:27,558 --> 00:12:32,840\nAnd notice my wireless adapter, so there's\nthe interface for the wireless adapter.\n\n258\n00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,674\nSo what I'm going to have to do\nis tell this network adapter,\n\n259\n00:12:35,674 --> 00:12:38,190\nI want you to go from a manage\nmode to the monitor mode.\n\n260\n00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,960\nAnd monitor mode says capture everything,\nright?\n\n261\n00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,098\nMonitor all the traffic.\n\n262\n00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:44,837\nSo that's what we're going to do here.\n\n263\n00:12:44,837 --> 00:12:47,647\nLet's go ahead and\nstart that on our interface.\n\n264\n00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:52,553\nAnd you can see that it tells me that\nthe driver here, it's supported and\n\n265\n00:12:52,553 --> 00:12:54,413\nnow it's in monitor mode.\n\n266\n00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:56,248\nBut that doesn't mean anything to us yet.\n\n267\n00:12:56,248 --> 00:12:59,835\nSo let's rerun our iwconfig.\n\n268\n00:12:59,835 --> 00:13:04,886\nAnd now you notice that it's not\nasking to be managed anymore.\n\n269\n00:13:04,886 --> 00:13:09,134\nNow this network adapter is saying,\nlet me hear everything.\n\n270\n00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:12,479\nNow again, we could do this\nfrom two different ways like\n\n271\n00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:17,331\nthe collection agency we could capture\nthe information right here from the CLI.\n\n272\n00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:20,232\nWe'll do that in a second here,\nbut I'm going to kinda cheat.\n\n273\n00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,614\nHow am I going to cheat?\n\n274\n00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:25,003\nSome of you guys are going to say\nhe's got the command prompt up and\n\n275\n00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:26,490\nhe's going back to the GUI.\n\n276\n00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,414\nWell I'm going to cheat\na little bit here and\n\n277\n00:13:28,414 --> 00:13:31,171\nI'm going to show you how\nthe graphical user interface works.\n\n278\n00:13:31,171 --> 00:13:34,108\nIt gives you a couple of warnings and\nsays hey you shouldn't be running this.\n\n279\n00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:37,213\nAnd I find my interface,\nit should be running it in superuser, but\n\n280\n00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:38,496\nthat's what we want here.\n\n281\n00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:41,387\nAnd I'm gonna go ahead and\nchoose a capture.\n\n282\n00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,074\nNow Ronnie,\n\n283\n00:13:42,074 --> 00:13:46,384\none of the things that we're gonna notice\nwhen we move this down here a little bit,\n\n284\n00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:50,235\nyou'll probably see it down at the bottom\nhere if I can grab that screen.\n\n285\n00:13:50,235 --> 00:13:52,854\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Kinda like fishing, you've gotta,\n\n286\n00:13:52,854 --> 00:13:57,043\nmy grandpa said, you think you're\ndoing everything right, there we go.\n\n287\n00:13:57,043 --> 00:13:57,775\nAll right, and\n\n288\n00:13:57,775 --> 00:14:01,670\ndown here at the bottom you can see that\nthese frames that it's catching, right?\n\n289\n00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,950\nIt's just picking them up and\nthey are, if I scroll down here,\n\n290\n00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,040\nyou are gonna see that it is\ncapturing a bunch of information.\n\n291\n00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,670\nRight?\n\n292\n00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:14,367\nSo that information lets me\nsee what is in the frame, and\n\n293\n00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:17,052\nI can see 802.11 Beacon, right?\n\n294\n00:14:17,052 --> 00:14:21,164\nNow that's an important concept,\nthese beacons don't necessarily go to\n\n295\n00:14:21,164 --> 00:14:24,505\nthe network adapters or\nthe devices that are being managed.\n\n296\n00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:26,105\nThey use them in the background,\n\n297\n00:14:26,105 --> 00:14:29,330\nthe access point does to\nmanage the entire network.\n\n298\n00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,800\nWell, it's not being sent to me,\nbut it doesn't matter now,\n\n299\n00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,180\nbecause I've had packet sniffing going on,\nI now can capture that information.\n\n300\n00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,444\nBut the packet sniffing alone,\nunderstand doesn't stop there.\n\n301\n00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:44,370\nIt's just the collection agency,\nit's just raw data does me no good.\n\n302\n00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:48,090\nSo things like Wireshark has here are also\nwhat's known as a protocol analyzer,\n\n303\n00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,720\nso they're built in, right?\n\n304\n00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,449\nThey don't necessarily\nhave to be built in.\n\n305\n00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:55,007\nBut a lot of your major ones today,\nit, both functionalities right,\n\n306\n00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:57,800\nthe collection agency and\nthen the analysis, right?\n\n307\n00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,790\nWhat are we collecting?\n\n308\n00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,270\nHow can we see that information?\n\n309\n00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,787\nWell we can also do that inside,\n\n310\n00:15:02,787 --> 00:15:07,458\nwe'll go ahead and\njust stop this Wireshark capture here.\n\n311\n00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,477\nI wanna show you how you can\ndo this in the terminal.\n\n312\n00:15:09,477 --> 00:15:14,913\nNow, you can also do this right\ninside of the terminal here,\n\n313\n00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:18,118\nand if I want, I can type airodump.\n\n314\n00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:21,280\nAnd these are all of the utilities\nthat are built into Kali.\n\n315\n00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,800\nKeep in mind, like Ronnie said earlier\ndo not do this against somebody else's\n\n316\n00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,950\nnetwork, because you can get\nin very big trouble there.\n\n317\n00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,550\nSo we're just simulating all\nof this in our own network.\n\n318\n00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,235\nAnd Ronnie I swear, if I could\ntype this we would be doing good.\n\n319\n00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:39,870\nSo all right, now what's going on here?\n\n320\n00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,875\nWell Kali in the interface is doing\nthe same thing that Wireshark is, but\n\n321\n00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,788\nit is capturing the information.\n\n322\n00:15:45,788 --> 00:15:49,616\nNow the problem with this here\nis it's good to start an attack,\n\n323\n00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:54,544\nwe've located your network, we've\nlocated that you've got an open network.\n\n324\n00:15:54,544 --> 00:15:57,734\nNow we're going to go ahead and\ncapture some of that information.\n\n325\n00:15:57,734 --> 00:15:59,614\nAll right.\nSo when you leave an open network,\n\n326\n00:15:59,614 --> 00:16:01,646\nagain it's like leaving\nthe front door open.\n\n327\n00:16:01,646 --> 00:16:05,171\nAll I gotta do is get to the front\ndoor and now I can see inside, and\n\n328\n00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:08,130\nI can all the information that's going on.\n\n329\n00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,540\nBut you have to understand\nthat the capture in and\n\n330\n00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,500\nof itself doesn't really let us do much.\n\n331\n00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,660\nIt just shows me the data.\n\n332\n00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,217\nSo what I can do is, I can tell Kali,\ngo ahead and output that,\n\n333\n00:16:18,217 --> 00:16:22,265\nwrite that to a file, and\nI can call, it capture file.\n\n334\n00:16:22,265 --> 00:16:22,807\nMaybe.\n\n335\n00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:24,849\nIf I can spell.\n\n336\n00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:26,307\nAnd it will fill.\n\n337\n00:16:26,307 --> 00:16:28,200\nI left an E out there.\n\n338\n00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,570\nWe'll just let it run for a second.\n\n339\n00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,680\nAnd we'll go ahead and stop this.\n\n340\n00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,010\nAnd now what I have,\nis not only a collection agency, but\n\n341\n00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,560\nif I go over to the folder here I'm\ngonna see I got this capture file.\n\n342\n00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,190\nBut what's that capture file for me.\n\n343\n00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,330\nRemember the collection agency\ndumped it down to a file and\n\n344\n00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:48,090\nif I double click this,\nI want you to look what happens.\n\n345\n00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,790\nInstantly it associates\nit with Wire Shark.\n\n346\n00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:54,560\nNow I've got the data captured and\nat the same time we've output it into\n\n347\n00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,460\nprotocol analyzer, so Ronnie I could get\nin here and I could see, what's the data.\n\n348\n00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:03,820\nRight, now this pax data means absolutely\nnothing to me, but at least it's a start.\n\n349\n00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,030\nIt's a start that I can\nstart gathering information.\n\n350\n00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:06,815\nBoy that was redundant.\n\n351\n00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That I can start gathering information\n\n352\n00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:13,000\noff of your network, and then use it to\nplan whatever my next attack might be.\n\n353\n00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,490\n>> Yeah, there's no doubt that\nwhat you have to realize, right.\n\n354\n00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,290\nIs that,\nthis is kind of a precursor to the attack.\n\n355\n00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,200\nWe're just gathering the information\nusing the packet sniffing software,\n\n356\n00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,190\nwhatever it might be, and\nnow we actually take that and\n\n357\n00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,770\nwe can put it into a protocol analyzer.\n\n358\n00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,190\nAnd from that analysis then, determine\nwhat we're actually looking for or\n\n359\n00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,250\nwhat an attacker normally is looking for.\n\n360\n00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,740\nAnd you do have to worry about this right.\n\n361\n00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,670\nYou gotta realize that the very fact that\nif you run a wireless network right.\n\n362\n00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,790\nEven in our building here.\n\n363\n00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,150\nIf somebody is sitting\noutside in a car and\n\n364\n00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:44,160\nthey have this technology,\nthey're able to get access to it, right?\n\n365\n00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,510\nAnd we can't really stop them,\n\n366\n00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,330\nthey're sitting there, we can't tell them,\nyou gotta turn off your packet sniffer.\n\n367\n00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,320\nThe packet sniffing is constantly\ngoing on if we need to.\n\n368\n00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,070\nA lot of times we also do this\nwithin our own networks to see what\n\n369\n00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,680\nother types of traffic is also floating\naround inside of our network as well.\n\n370\n00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,320\nBut this is one of the most prevalent\nways that we do end up talking\n\n371\n00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,160\nabout wireless attacks.\n\n372\n00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,950\nIf somebody has gathered enough, you know\npackets or enough frames out there and\n\n373\n00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,690\nthen they take it and they turn it around\nthey run it through a protocol analyzer\n\n374\n00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,700\nthat allows them filter down and\nsee what they're looking for and\n\n375\n00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,040\nfrom that point then they can\nform the basis of the attacks.\n\n376\n00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,080\nSo that's why you're also seeing this\nunderneath a category that we call\n\n377\n00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,580\nwireless attacks as well.\n\n378\n00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:24,070\nAlright, so\nWes what else do we have ahead of us?\n\n379\n00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,872\n>> Yeah.\nWell, and\n\n380\n00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:26,682\nnow that we've got some information.\n\n381\n00:18:26,682 --> 00:18:27,265\nRight.\n\n382\n00:18:27,265 --> 00:18:29,640\nWell, there's other types\nof attacks out there.\n\n383\n00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,891\nThis is just a basic\nscanning type of attack.\n\n384\n00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:32,932\nRight.\nWe're profiling.\n\n385\n00:18:32,932 --> 00:18:34,849\nWe're trying to find\nthe information that you got.\n\n386\n00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:35,480\nRight.\n\n387\n00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,940\nI can see right here\nthe security encryption methods.\n\n388\n00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,100\nRight.\nI could see that counter mode,\n\n389\n00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,620\nwhatever, CCMP, long acronym there for\nthe replacement of TKIP.\n\n390\n00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,630\nSo, I can see a lot of information,\nI can see the channels that you're on.\n\n391\n00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,720\nI can see the signal strength,\nright, and one of the things\n\n392\n00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,000\nthat some of these attacks require\nis being very close to your network.\n\n393\n00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,830\nSo that's going to be something that\nI have to keep in mind as well.\n\n394\n00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,240\nOne of the most, a common and\n\n395\n00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,620\nvery easy attack is something\nknown as a rogue access point.\n\n396\n00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,220\nWhat I'd like to here, Ron, is just start\nthis capture up again because I had it,\n\n397\n00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,260\nI had it, the screen shrunk a little bit,\nand what I can't see, and I'm gonna\n\n398\n00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,980\ngo ahead and stop this for a little bit,\nis this information right here, alright?\n\n399\n00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,670\nThat's my wireless access point.\n\n400\n00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:20,300\nThat's the ones Ronnie and\nI have sitting back here on the table.\n\n401\n00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:25,780\nNow, a rogue access point,\nall I would have to do is mimic the SSID.\n\n402\n00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:31,057\nAll right, if I can change the network\nname to look like something like yours.\n\n403\n00:19:31,057 --> 00:19:34,780\nWell now, maybe somebody comes to work,\nthey see that,\n\n404\n00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,975\nand they expect it to be\nthe legitimate network.\n\n405\n00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:39,430\nAnd now they connect to it.\n\n406\n00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,630\nWell now that you're connected to\nmy rogue access point, guess what?\n\n407\n00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,780\nI just turned around here, and\nI start capturing information again, and\n\n408\n00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,570\nI can capture the information\nthat's going across the network.\n\n409\n00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,362\nWhen it goes across the network,\n\n410\n00:19:50,362 --> 00:19:53,891\nnow you're in danger of me seeing\nthe information that you have.\n\n411\n00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:57,474\nSo Ronnie, the rogue access\npoint is fairly simplistic.\n\n412\n00:19:57,474 --> 00:20:00,074\nNow, sometimes it gets confused\nwith another attack that we're\n\n413\n00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:00,932\ngonna mention here.\n\n414\n00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:05,156\nBut for the most part, a rogue access\npoint, it starts handing out things like\n\n415\n00:20:05,156 --> 00:20:07,974\nDHCP addresses,\nyour device is connected to them.\n\n416\n00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:12,769\nEasiest attack is denial of service, now\nyou don't have connection to the Internet,\n\n417\n00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:16,266\nbut it can be far more invasive than that,\nfar more malicious.\n\n418\n00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:19,979\nWe can gather that information and\nif you've got applications and\n\n419\n00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:23,757\nservices running, we turn around and\nwe get that information, and\n\n420\n00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:25,760\nnow we can start text, after that.\n\n421\n00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,210\n>> You know a lot of times where you tend\nto see the rogue access point more often,\n\n422\n00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,110\nis when somebody has requested that they\nwant wireless service in their office.\n\n423\n00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:36,910\nAnd of course IT guy like me and Wes, what\nwe would say is, well, we'll get to it but\n\n424\n00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,820\nit's not gonna be anytime soon.\n\n425\n00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,230\nAnd so they get frustrated and\nwhat do they do?\n\n426\n00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,370\nThey head out to a box store somewhere,\n\n427\n00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,400\nthey buy a fairly\ninexpensive access point.\n\n428\n00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,380\nAnd then they take it into work and\nthe plug it right in.\n\n429\n00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,150\nNow you might be wondering, well,\nwhat's the big deal, you know?\n\n430\n00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,370\nThat will give them the wireless\naccess that they need.\n\n431\n00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:55,340\nBut the problem is,\nit hasn't gone through any vetting.\n\n432\n00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,010\nIn other words, we haven't actually seen,\n\n433\n00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,960\ndoes it meet our security\npolicies within our organization?\n\n434\n00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,320\nWe haven't actually set it up so\n\n435\n00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,370\nit doesn't interfere with some of the\nissues like what Wes was talking about.\n\n436\n00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,710\nIn other words, it's not handing out DHCP.\n\n437\n00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,660\nIt's not trying to do things and\ntake over.\n\n438\n00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:13,420\nRemember that if we hand out DHCP,\nanother DHCP server out there and\n\n439\n00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:18,310\nthere is no default gateway, well people\nthat accidentally connect to that access\n\n440\n00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:22,310\npoint, is denial of service that Wes was\ntalking about and that can be dangerous.\n\n441\n00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:26,000\nThe other thing is, if they've set it up\nas a default and now they've bought it and\n\n442\n00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,870\nplugged it into their wall,\nthey are now near a public area.\n\n443\n00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,030\nNow people might be able to\njump onto that access point and\n\n444\n00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,990\nnow they've got a connection\ninside of our own network\n\n445\n00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,970\neven though we didn't want to allow for\nthat to happen.\n\n446\n00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,770\nBut if somebody has just set it\nup as default now that's it.\n\n447\n00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,974\nNow they do have that connection point.\n\n448\n00:21:43,974 --> 00:21:46,932\nSo we've gotta be very careful when\nwe start seeing stuff like this.\n\n449\n00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:50,500\nThese things are very invasive, even\nthough you don't think that they can be.\n\n450\n00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:56,350\nDHCP is one of the most invasive types\nof protocol, or pervasive I should say.\n\n451\n00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:59,600\nRemember that what happens is that\nevery device on your network,\n\n452\n00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,720\nif we are setting up, for\nobtaining IP addresses automatically,\n\n453\n00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,310\nevery device is looking for a DHCP server,\nand if you bring this one up and\n\n454\n00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,800\nit answers first, it doesn't care that\nyou have an authorized one or not.\n\n455\n00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,860\nIt will provide an answer.\n\n456\n00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,165\nSo you do have to be careful and\n\n457\n00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:16,516\nthis is why it's very important\nthat we want to try and\n\n458\n00:22:16,516 --> 00:22:19,931\nprevent things like rogue access points\nfrom getting on our network as well.\n\n459\n00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:25,016\n>> Yeah, and\nDHCP is a fairly unsecure protocol, right.\n\n460\n00:22:25,016 --> 00:22:27,057\nRonnie said you ask a question,\nI need an IP address.\n\n461\n00:22:27,057 --> 00:22:30,016\nThat DHCP server says okay, you have it.\n\n462\n00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,016\nSo, when we start to\ncapture this information.\n\n463\n00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:33,770\nIf I turn around and\nget on your network and\n\n464\n00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,891\nthen hey complementary to that you say,\nhere's an IP address as well.\n\n465\n00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:37,849\nWell thank you.\n\n466\n00:22:37,849 --> 00:22:41,308\nSo, you definitely have to\nbe very careful on that one.\n\n467\n00:22:41,308 --> 00:22:45,539\nNow, I said that the rogue access point is\nsometimes confused with another attack,\n\n468\n00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:46,141\nall right.\n\n469\n00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:50,080\nNow they're close to the same but\na little bit different, right.\n\n470\n00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,750\nThe rogue access point is where I just put\nan access point out there and I try to get\n\n471\n00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,550\npeople to connect to it, but I'm not\nreally going much farther than that.\n\n472\n00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,966\nBut there's another one called\nan evil twin attack and\n\n473\n00:22:59,966 --> 00:23:03,130\nan evil twin attack is where we\nget a little bit more malicious.\n\n474\n00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,660\nRight?\nNow what we're gonna do,\n\n475\n00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:10,250\nis we're gonna find a legitimate access\npoint on the network, all right?\n\n476\n00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:13,220\nI'm not just taking a rogue access\npoint and turning it on and\n\n477\n00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,020\nhoping people connect to it.\n\n478\n00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,380\nNow what I'm gonna do is find\na legitimate wireless access point and\n\n479\n00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,080\nI'm gonna mirror it identically,\nso that your devices will\n\n480\n00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,890\ndisassociate themselves with a legitimate\naccess point and connect to mine.\n\n481\n00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,580\nAnd then the same thing that you\nwould do in a rouge access point,\n\n482\n00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,910\nyou start maybe running your packet\ncapture you start analyzing the data.\n\n483\n00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,599\nSo rather than just talk about it,\nlet's go ahead and show you that.\n\n484\n00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:40,474\nSo I got my packet capture still\nrunning in the background, right?\n\n485\n00:23:40,474 --> 00:23:44,040\nI can go ahead and\nclose that down or just stop that.\n\n486\n00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,430\nBecause I've got some information here\nthat's really, really valuable to me.\n\n487\n00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,855\nRight?\nI can see the access\n\n488\n00:23:48,855 --> 00:23:50,557\npoint that we're looking at.\n\n489\n00:23:50,557 --> 00:23:54,118\nBut I can also see it's basic\nservice set identifier.\n\n490\n00:23:54,118 --> 00:23:56,743\nIt's identifying the access point.\n\n491\n00:23:56,743 --> 00:24:00,606\nNow If I just right click on that and copy\non that, I now have that information and\n\n492\n00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,042\nthat's value information\nto start this attack.\n\n493\n00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:06,690\nAll right, so one of the things that\nI have to do, is I have to also pay\n\n494\n00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,091\nattention to the channel that\nthis access point is running on.\n\n495\n00:24:10,091 --> 00:24:18,775\nSo I actually have to stop\nmy promiscuous mode here.\n\n496\n00:24:18,775 --> 00:24:21,730\nAnd we'll make sure that we\nidentify the adapter here.\n\n497\n00:24:23,744 --> 00:24:25,532\nAll right.\n\n498\n00:24:25,532 --> 00:24:28,991\nWe'll double check here.\n\n499\n00:24:28,991 --> 00:24:31,640\nAnd like I said,\nI'm gonna challenge my abilities.\n\n500\n00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,060\nOkay, so it's back in Managed mode,\nthat's what I'm looking at now.\n\n501\n00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,500\nAll right, but now what I need to do is,\n\n502\n00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,600\nbecause I know the channel that the access\npoint's on, I gotta say airmon.\n\n503\n00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,210\nWhen you start up,\ndon't just start up and expect.\n\n504\n00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,930\nI want you to listen\non a specific channel.\n\n505\n00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,230\nSo, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n506\n00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,542\nWe're gonna do just an airmon here.\n\n507\n00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:53,790\nAll right, ng and I can see the wireless\nnetwork here is the adapter itself.\n\n508\n00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:59,190\nAll right, we're gonna do start and we're\njust gonna put a channel number here.\n\n509\n00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,800\nAnd in fact, I don't know that\nyou have to do the switch.\n\n510\n00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,540\nOkay, there it goes.\n\n511\n00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:06,410\nAll right, so it's letting me know,\nand up here I said, and you know what?\n\n512\n00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,840\nI have to make sure that\nwe start that on channel 6,\n\n513\n00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,970\nthat's what the axis point's on.\n\n514\n00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,480\nAll right, so now I've changed it.\n\n515\n00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,630\nI said, listen to the same channel\nthat that access point is on.\n\n516\n00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:20,280\nAll right, and what we're gonna\ndo here now that that's ready,\n\n517\n00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,298\nwe're ready to do our next attack,\nwe're gonna do airbase ng, all right and\n\n518\n00:25:25,298 --> 00:25:32,900\nwe're gonna a and we're gonna put\nin that SSID that we captured here.\n\n519\n00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:37,680\nAnd now what I'm gonna do is put in\nthe network name which is the essid,\n\n520\n00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:43,530\nand we'll go ahead and define that, and\nyou might have seen that that's a TestNet.\n\n521\n00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:46,060\nAll right,\nwe can put a channel number here, but\n\n522\n00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,830\nI believe we might be able\nto just leave that out.\n\n523\n00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:53,613\nIt'll probably error out on me,\nbut we'll see here.\n\n524\n00:25:53,613 --> 00:26:00,277\nAnd we'll go ahead and do our interface\nname, and now what's going on?\n\n525\n00:26:00,277 --> 00:26:06,406\nAll right, now, I have my machine\nis acting like an access point,\n\n526\n00:26:06,406 --> 00:26:12,323\nand if I launch up airmon,\nall right and we take a look at airmon.\n\n527\n00:26:15,272 --> 00:26:16,770\nNot airmon, let's do airdump.\n\n528\n00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:20,937\nThat's the one we want, cuz we want\nto actually see the information.\n\n529\n00:26:20,937 --> 00:26:24,883\nSo if I do that and I do start,\n\n530\n00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:28,669\nand apparently I didn't.\n\n531\n00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:32,570\nYou don't have to type start,\nthat's my fault there.\n\n532\n00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,591\nThere we go.\n\n533\n00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:34,781\nAll right.\n\n534\n00:26:37,585 --> 00:26:42,972\nIf we just give it a second here, you're\ngonna notice that before there was WEP.\n\n535\n00:26:42,972 --> 00:26:45,387\nI wanna go ahead and stop this real quick.\n\n536\n00:26:45,387 --> 00:26:47,268\nAll right.\n\n537\n00:26:47,268 --> 00:26:50,621\nThat network, the legitimate network,\nhad wired equivalent privacy,\n\n538\n00:26:50,621 --> 00:26:54,257\nwe're setting this up, I'll let you\nguys on it, we're gonna do a WepAttack.\n\n539\n00:26:54,257 --> 00:26:56,323\nBut it had WEP running, all right.\n\n540\n00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,807\nAnd with WEP running,\nnotice this one doesn't.\n\n541\n00:26:58,807 --> 00:27:01,600\nThat's because this machine\nisn't running encryption.\n\n542\n00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,940\nBut if you weren't aware of it, that\nthis is not your TestNet, these are not\n\n543\n00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,970\nthe droids you're looking for, you might\nconnect to this in an unencrypted manner,\n\n544\n00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,340\ncapture your information.\n\n545\n00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,040\nAnd now we start our attacks.\n\n546\n00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,120\nSo Ronnie we've really,\nreally gotta watch it.\n\n547\n00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,650\nThese attacks can lead you into some\nproblems, so secure your networks.\n\n548\n00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:24,600\n>> There's no doubt the evil twin attacks\nare the ones that are much more insidious,\n\n549\n00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,870\nand the very fact that somebody\nthen accidentally plugged this in.\n\n550\n00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:33,196\nSomebody has now been able to take\nyour legitimate access point.\n\n551\n00:27:33,196 --> 00:27:37,153\nAnd what they've done is they've created a\nwhole another access point with the same,\n\n552\n00:27:37,153 --> 00:27:38,030\neverything to it.\n\n553\n00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:40,283\nAnd you might think,\nwell what's the big deal behind that?\n\n554\n00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,227\nWell the big deal is,\n\n555\n00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:44,900\nif it's pushed through your legitimate\naccess point off right, and everybody's\n\n556\n00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,677\ngoing through that one well who controls\nthat access point now, and that's the key,\n\n557\n00:27:48,677 --> 00:27:52,376\nright is who is actually controlling that,\nthat's why it's called an evil twin.\n\n558\n00:27:52,376 --> 00:27:56,940\nThe legitimate one is an access point that\nyou and I have actually configured, and\n\n559\n00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,438\nwe actually control, we're the ones that\ncan actually say what we wanna do, but\n\n560\n00:28:01,438 --> 00:28:03,904\nthat evil twin one is\nthe one that we can not.\n\n561\n00:28:03,904 --> 00:28:07,812\nSo if now you have a hacker like Wes that\ncomes along, and he decides to do stuff\n\n562\n00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:12,160\nlike this, well he has complete control\nover that access point, and now you don't.\n\n563\n00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,990\nThe problem is fairly simple.\n\n564\n00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,760\nWell, who reports an evil twin?\n\n565\n00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,350\nNobody reports an evil twin.\n\n566\n00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,310\nAnd the reason why they don't report\nthis is because they don't actually\n\n567\n00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,630\nknow what's happening.\n\n568\n00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,520\nAnd if you're not careful, you don't know\nthat it's happening and so that means all\n\n569\n00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,310\nof your wireless traffic could be\ngoing through this unvetted device.\n\n570\n00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:34,230\nAnd that means that we don't have\na clue whether or not, that means that\n\n571\n00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,430\nsecure information or very sensitive\ninformation is now going across somebody\n\n572\n00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:42,500\nelse's screen, when it should not be going\nacross somebody else's screen as well.\n\n573\n00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,060\nAnd that's why it's very important\nthat we start taking a look\n\n574\n00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,830\nat some of these wireless attacks.\n\n575\n00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:50,549\nSo, Wes you've actually taken us through\nquite a few of these different types\n\n576\n00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:51,177\nof attacks.\n\n577\n00:28:51,177 --> 00:28:54,634\nWe've talked about the very fact\nof the Wardriving, and of course,\n\n578\n00:28:54,634 --> 00:28:56,726\nthe Warchalking, what we talked about.\n\n579\n00:28:56,726 --> 00:28:58,993\nWe've also taken a look\nat packet sniffing, and\n\n580\n00:28:58,993 --> 00:29:01,450\nwe briefly talked about\nprotocol analyzing.\n\n581\n00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:05,310\nAnd then this last example of some of\nthe different ones, adding in devices,\n\n582\n00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:09,693\nreally at least begins to set in some\nof the context of some of the wireless\n\n583\n00:29:09,693 --> 00:29:13,300\nattacks that we're actually gonna\nface as security professionals.\n\n584\n00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:18,230\nNow Wes, I think there's a lot more,\nbut looking at the actual time,\n\n585\n00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:21,480\nwe've kind of run out of time which means,\nwe actually have to go into a part two.\n\n586\n00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,055\n>> That's right.\n\n587\n00:29:22,055 --> 00:29:23,230\n>> Cuz there's no other way for\n\n588\n00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:26,315\nus to actually jam everything\nin into one single episode.\n\n589\n00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:28,215\nSo Wes, you're gonna come back and\njoin us for part two.\n\n590\n00:29:28,215 --> 00:29:29,125\n>> Absolutely.\nThis was fun.\n\n591\n00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:32,295\nWe've got more goodies on tap for\nyou, but I talk a lot.\n\n592\n00:29:32,295 --> 00:29:32,795\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n593\n00:29:32,795 --> 00:29:33,585\n>> So thank you.\n\n594\n00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:34,195\nIt's been\n\n595\n00:29:34,195 --> 00:29:35,215\nfun.\n>> All right.\n\n596\n00:29:35,215 --> 00:29:36,485\nWell that's a great place for\n\n597\n00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:40,995\nus to go ahead and end this episode then.\nThank you also for joining us as well.\n\n598\n00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:42,905\nAnd signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n599\n00:29:42,905 --> 00:29:43,775\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n600\n00:29:43,775 --> 00:29:46,966\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n601\n00:29:46,966 -->

00:00:19.780\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and\ntoday we're taking the CompTIA Security+.\n\n4\n00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.500\nSpecifically talking\nabout wireless attacks.\n\n5\n00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.070\nAnd we're actually in a Part 2.\n\n6\n00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.900\nIn other words, we've already gone\nthrough several of the attacks, and\n\n7\n00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.890\nthat show was so filled with\ninformation that we needed a Part 2.\n\n8\n00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.282\nAnd the nice thing is,\nwe actually brought back with us Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:33.282 --> 00:00:36.980\nWes Bryan, the security guru that's gonna\nhelp us out in understanding some of these\n\n10\n00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.010\nwireless attacks.\n\n11\n00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.720\nAnd so Wes, where are we picking up,\nwhat do we need to understand here?\n\n12\n00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.090\n>> All right, so, you know,\n>> In looking back at the first episode,\n\n13\n00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.900\nwe talked a lot about\ngathering information and\n\n14\n00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.960\nwe talked about the concept of Wardriving.\n\n15\n00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.570\nAnd we even started some\ninformation gathering.\n\n16\n00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.510\nAnd we also talked about\nthings like evil twin attacks.\n\n17\n00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.250\nWell now what are we going on into?\n\n18\n00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.460\nWe're going on into,\nwell a couple of topics,\n\n19\n00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.740\nthey almost, when it comes to the attacks\nthey're almost holding hands.\n\n20\n00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.070\nThey're almost complementary\nto one another, and\n\n21\n00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.590\n>> And one attack could be confused as to\n\n22\n00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.200\nleading you into another type of attack.\n\n23\n00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.170\nAnd more specifically,\n\n24\n00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.200\none of the attacks I'm talking about\nis something known as a replay attack.\n\n25\n00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.940\nWe talk about a replay attack,\nwhat we mean is taking data and\n\n26\n00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.390\ncrafting a frame, an 802.11 frame, and\n\n27\n00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.860\nthen as we've talked about in other\nsecurity plus episodes, right?\n\n28\n00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.190\nReplay attack means I just send that\ninformation to some kind of managing\n\n29\n00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.490\ndevice or authoritative device, right,\n\n30\n00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.470\nif you're doing a replay\nattack against a web server,\n\n31\n00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.580\nyou're taking session cookie information\nand passing it back to the web server.\n\n32\n00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.090\nWell, conceptually it's not\nreally too much different.\n\n33\n00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.880\nWhat we're doing is we're taking\nsome network traffic that's used\n\n34\n00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.160\na lot within our network.\n\n35\n00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.690\nAnd there's different types of them.\n\n36\n00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.981\nOne specific replay attack that works\nvery, very well, depending on I guess your\n\n37\n00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:57.950\nperspective, it could be a very bad thing,\nis what's known as an ARP replay attack.\n\n38\n00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.160\nAll right?\nThere are definitely other ones out there\n\n39\n00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.120\nthat you can do.\n\n40\n00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.590\nThings like deauthentication where you\ncould kick everybody off of the wireless\n\n41\n00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.500\nnetwork by crafting a packet that says\nexactly that, deauthorize everybody.\n\n42\n00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.700\nBut we want to show you one that's\na little bit more specific.\n\n43\n00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.320\nIt's called the Arbor plan attack\nto kind of give you an example\n\n44\n00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.860\nof what's going on here.\n\n45\n00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.240\nSo here of my machine I've got Kali.\n\n46\n00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.440\nKali, Kali I'm not sure exactly how you\nsay that here, and what we're gonna do is\n\n47\n00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.840\nwe're gonna take some information that we\nalready gathered in the previous episode.\n\n48\n00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.630\nRemember we talked about setting it up\nto where you can capture information.\n\n49\n00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.590\nAnd that really is you know something\nthat you need ahead of time.\n\n50\n00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.440\nSo if you haven't seen that episode let's\ngo ahead and real quick show you what\n\n51\n00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.250\nwe're going to be doing here and\nI do have to challenge my typing ability.\n\n52\n00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.240\nI've made sure that this network adapter\nis in what's known as promiscuous mode,\n\n53\n00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.910\nmonitor mode.\n\n54\n00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.630\nSo now what it can do is, it can capture\ninformation on the network, right.\n\n55\n00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.230\nAnd then I can take other, like we've\ntalked about, other technologies here,\n\n56\n00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.700\nthat are built into this distro, and we\ncan use that to gather that information.\n\n57\n00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.060\nWell some of the information\nthat I'm looking for\n\n58\n00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.700\nright now, all right, and\nit really isn't gonna take too much here.\n\n59\n00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.000\nBut I am looking for\nsome information to start this attack.\n\n60\n00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.907\nFor me, very, very important\nis what is known as the basic\n\n61\n00:03:16.907 --> 00:03:20.225\nservice set identifier, this BSSID.\n\n62\n00:03:20.225 --> 00:03:23.645\nKeep in mind that's really just\na MAC address of the access point.\n\n63\n00:03:23.645 --> 00:03:25.828\nThe ESSID is what we\ncall the network name, so\n\n64\n00:03:25.828 --> 00:03:29.020\nthat's very important that\nI gain that information.\n\n65\n00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.520\nJust like we did when we\nwere in the last episode.\n\n66\n00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.710\nSo we take that information, right, and\nwe also have to find an association,\n\n67\n00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.300\na device that's already connected\nto the wireless network.\n\n68\n00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.860\nI wonder if I can capture that real\nquick here and we can see that.\n\n69\n00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.580\nBe nice to just see that, there we go,\nlet me stop it real quick, okay?\n\n70\n00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.020\nSo here I have a station.\n\n71\n00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.660\nAll right, it is connected to that\nnetwork adapter or that network.\n\n72\n00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.950\nNotice I see the BSSID for\nthe access point itself, right.\n\n73\n00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.110\nWell I see that information\nright here too.\n\n74\n00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.595\nBut what's so important and\nat the same time a little scary,\n\n75\n00:04:07.595 --> 00:04:11.460\nis I can also see the device\nthat's connected as well.\n\n76\n00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.100\nIn this case, Ronnie over here\noff camera's got my my Mac,\n\n77\n00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.560\nMacBook that's connected\nto wireless access point.\n\n78\n00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.780\nIt's already been associated.\n\n79\n00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.890\nSo if I've got that information and I've\nalready captured it I can turn around,\n\n80\n00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.780\ntake that information the BSSID,\nthe host address of somebody that's\n\n81\n00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.920\nalready with the access point and\nI can start to run air replay.\n\n82\n00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.420\nAnd okay, so it's doing some frequency\nhopping here, so it is important.\n\n83\n00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.670\nIn fact Ronnie and I were talking about\nthis prior to the episode starting.\n\n84\n00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.340\nIt's boy, when things hop around here\nyou've gotta make sure that you configure\n\n85\n00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.220\nthem appropriately.\n\n86\n00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.350\nSo what's going on here is,\n\n87\n00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.420\nmy network adaptor is on another\nchannel than what the access point is.\n\n88\n00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.203\nSo if I do this again, let's see if\nwe can get that back to, there we go.\n\n89\n00:04:54.203 --> 00:04:57.526\nNow what I'm doing right now\nis I'm trying to find some\n\n90\n00:04:57.526 --> 00:05:00.990\nARP requests that are out\nthere on the network, right?\n\n91\n00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.430\nARP, the address resolution protocol is\ntrying to resolve those IP addresses, so\n\n92\n00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.140\nit's just part of\nthe normal communication.\n\n93\n00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.070\nSo Ronnie if you could, go ahead and\n\n94\n00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.150\ndisconnect from that wireless network,\nand then what\n\n95\n00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.480\nhe's going to do is he's going to\nreconnect to the wireless network, right?\n\n96\n00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.640\nYou guys out there, I'm sure,\nhave taken your mobile devices, right?\n\n97\n00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.670\nYou leave, you go to work, you come back,\n\n98\n00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.820\nand then those devices\nconnect back to the network.\n\n99\n00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.630\nOne of the things that I want to\nsee here is the fact that these,\n\n100\n00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.530\nthere we go, notice the packets\nare starting to gain a lot of frames.\n\n101\n00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.620\nThese are ARP requests that say that it's\ncapturing the acknowledgement packets and\n\n102\n00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.970\nthen it's going to turn around and\n\n103\n00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.840\nyou can see over here it's going to send\nthat information back to the access point.\n\n104\n00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.590\nWell, that could be a couple of things,\nright?\n\n105\n00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.870\nWe're using it as a replay attack and\nthat's what we're talking about\n\n106\n00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.990\nthe context of is to replay this\ninformation, but what else can that do?\n\n107\n00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.590\nIn other episodes, we talked more\nabout the 802.11 standard and\n\n108\n00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.110\nthe media access method.\n\n109\n00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.400\nWe talk about carrier sense,\n\n110\n00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.320\nmultiple access, collision avoidance,\nso it's a wait in line access method.\n\n111\n00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.920\nYou send your information, I wait.\n\n112\n00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.090\nI send my information, you wait.\n\n113\n00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.230\nSo wait in line.\n\n114\n00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.880\nWe already have that wait\nin line media access method\n\n115\n00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.500\nthat could cause some delays,\nbut now it's even more.\n\n116\n00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.253\nImagine my attacking laptop here,\n\n117\n00:06:19.253 --> 00:06:24.310\nis constantly sending information\nto the access point, right?\n\n118\n00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.260\nAnd all it can do is just to keep up with\nthose requests that I'm sending, and\n\n119\n00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.060\nit's acknowledging them back here, and\nI've got, well not too many right here,\n\n120\n00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.410\nyou can see almost 32,000 frames that\nare being sent to this access point.\n\n121\n00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.840\nSo what does that do?\n\n122\n00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.180\nTake a wait and line media access method,\nand couple that with too much information\n\n123\n00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.440\nflooding the network, and\nnow you've got a jamming attack.\n\n124\n00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.490\nNot necessarily interference, they talk\nabout interference as well, right, and\n\n125\n00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.710\nthere are technologies that out there\ncould put more information out that\n\n126\n00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.590\ncan potentially scramble wireless\ncommunications, right, but\n\n127\n00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.090\nthis also could be a form\nof jamming as well.\n\n128\n00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.010\nBecause when it cannot respond back to me,\nThe problem here is,\n\n129\n00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.870\nit can't respond to any legitimate\ndevices on the network.\n\n130\n00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.880\nSo Ronnie what we get here is the fact\nthat, even though we're doing a replay\n\n131\n00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.590\nattack, we can even be a little more\nmalicious and this can be a denial of\n\n132\n00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.180\nservice attack jamming people, legitimate\nusers from connecting to the network.\n\n133\n00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.940\n>> What we're starting to see\nhere is something fairly simple,\n\n134\n00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.180\nwhereas when we looked at the idea of\nwar chalking and packet sniffing And\n\n135\n00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.610\neven the rogue access point.\n\n136\n00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.660\nSo a lot of this is a little\nbit more passive, right?\n\n137\n00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.500\nWhere we set a device in its place, and\nthen we're gathering the information.\n\n138\n00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.990\nNow Wes is beginning to show up that\nsome of these attacks can be, well,\n\n139\n00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:35.550\nfairly targeted, in other words, they're\nfairly active, or even, what is it?\n\n140\n00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.720\nThe idea of antagonistic, at this point,\nis what we're beginning to see here.\n\n141\n00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.625\nThe idea of going from just trying to\ncapture information to now actively\n\n142\n00:07:43.625 --> 00:07:46.122\njamming or\ndenial of service of information,\n\n143\n00:07:46.122 --> 00:07:49.463\nthis is somebody that is really\ntrying to break our networks.\n\n144\n00:07:49.463 --> 00:07:51.970\nAnd that's what we have to\nrealize as well is that if we\n\n145\n00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.646\ncan do denial of service on\nwireless that means that hey,\n\n146\n00:07:54.646 --> 00:07:57.920\nthere's a good portion of our network\nusers that are gonna be down.\n\n147\n00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.610\nAnd this is something we've gotta\nprotect ourselves against as well.\n\n148\n00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:03.882\nSo we actually have to\nthink about that too.\n\n149\n00:08:03.882 --> 00:08:08.414\nNow there's of course other forms of\nattacks that are just as dangerous, but\n\n150\n00:08:08.414 --> 00:08:12.946\nthis one is not really not using a device\nto capture the information too much,\n\n151\n00:08:12.946 --> 00:08:16.941\nas much as it's about attacking\nthe actual protocols inside of it.\n\n152\n00:08:16.941 --> 00:08:21.550\nWes, when we start hearing about the idea\nof WEP attacks, what are we talking about?\n\n153\n00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.880\n>> Well, you know, WEP is surrounded\nby vulnerabilities, and they've\n\n154\n00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.320\ntalked very in depth in other security\nplus episodes about what WEP and WPH.\n\n155\n00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.590\nWEP, what is it?\n\n156\n00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:32.820\nWired equivalent privacy.\n\n157\n00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.460\nRight?\n\n158\n00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.090\nWe've got a series of encryption\nprotocols that we've used over the years.\n\n159\n00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.630\nOne of the very first ones that we\nused was wired equivalent privacy.\n\n160\n00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.820\nAgain, it's surrounded by problems.\n\n161\n00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.500\nOne of the first problems that it has is,\nout there in front of it,\n\n162\n00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.950\nit's got what's known as an IV,\nan initialization vector.\n\n163\n00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.546\nAnd this is a way to randomize to make\nsure that two pieces of encrypted data\n\n164\n00:08:52.546 --> 00:08:54.061\ndon't have the same outputs.\n\n165\n00:08:54.061 --> 00:08:58.717\nBut the problem is, that little bit\nof information, it's actually sending\n\n166\n00:08:58.717 --> 00:09:03.242\nclear text and due to the fact that\nit's only 24 bits, it's very small.\n\n167\n00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:06.762\nSo, we can gather that\ninformation fairly quickly.\n\n168\n00:09:06.762 --> 00:09:07.642\nAll right?\n\n169\n00:09:07.642 --> 00:09:10.402\nAnd when we gather than information,\nwhat does it do for us?\n\n170\n00:09:10.402 --> 00:09:13.562\nWell, it allows us to reverse\nengineer the encryption key.\n\n171\n00:09:13.562 --> 00:09:15.562\nSee, that's the other problem with WEP.\n\n172\n00:09:15.562 --> 00:09:20.222\nWEP's keys unless you add other forms\nof WEP, the key doesn't change.\n\n173\n00:09:20.222 --> 00:09:24.158\nSo it gives the hackers all the time they\nneed to figure out what your key is,\n\n174\n00:09:24.158 --> 00:09:27.551\ncrack it, and get on your network and\nwe can actually show this.\n\n175\n00:09:27.551 --> 00:09:31.360\nSo, here on Collie, the Collie operating\nsystem here, let me go ahead and\n\n176\n00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.591\nminimize this and you can see well we've\ngot it's filing some information here and\n\n177\n00:09:35.591 --> 00:09:38.627\nyou can see it's really injecting\npackets on the network.\n\n178\n00:09:38.627 --> 00:09:40.620\nAll right, and it's reading packets.\n\n179\n00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.020\nBut now what I wanna do is I\nwanna capture this information.\n\n180\n00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.790\nRemember, this is just sending.\n\n181\n00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:49.980\nLike Ronnie said, this is just being more\nannoying at this point than anything else.\n\n182\n00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.750\nBut now we're gonna take this\ninformation and we're gonna use it.\n\n183\n00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:56.790\nSo we can actually tell our\ncapture utility airmon here,\n\n184\n00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:01.100\nwe can say, you know what,\nI don't want you to capture everything.\n\n185\n00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.190\nWhat I want you to do is just\ncapture the initialization vector.\n\n186\n00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.570\nSo I can say -ivs and\nthat's what it's gonna do.\n\n187\n00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.280\nIt's gonna look more specifically for\nthose initialization vectors.\n\n188\n00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:18.450\nLet me go ahead real quick and\nwe're gonna open another terminal\n\n189\n00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:23.320\nbecause I forgot the basic service of\nthe data file file of That machine.\n\n190\n00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.760\n[LAUGH] And it's good to have\nthis information ahead of time.\n\n191\n00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.100\nBut we can kind of show you it in real\ntime here, so that you guys can see hey,\n\n192\n00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.750\nthis is how you would have to\ngather that information if you\n\n193\n00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.290\nwere doing this yourself.\n\n194\n00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.420\nSo just double-checking that that's there.\n\n195\n00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.831\nAnd we'll go ahead real quick and\ndo an error dump.\n\n196\n00:10:46.461 --> 00:10:48.666\nAnd, we'll go ahead and\ntell it what interface,\n\n197\n00:10:48.666 --> 00:10:51.658\nbecause I need a little bit more\ninformation that I don't have, and\n\n198\n00:10:51.658 --> 00:10:53.780\nI can get it fairly quick\nhere right off the top.\n\n199\n00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.970\nWe should see, there it is,\nthere's that BS, or\n\n200\n00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:00.790\nthat basic service set identifier\nthat we were looking for.\n\n201\n00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.240\nAnd in this type of an attack,\n\n202\n00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.320\nI need that information,\nthere's just no way around it.\n\n203\n00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:10.012\nSo now that I've got that information,\nI can come up here and\n\n204\n00:11:10.012 --> 00:11:14.981\ntype bssid, potentially, and\nput that information in there.\n\n205\n00:11:14.981 --> 00:11:19.474\nAll right, and then what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna tell it what channel I want it\n\n206\n00:11:19.474 --> 00:11:21.030\nto operate on, all right?\n\n207\n00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.120\nAnd that's important cuz I don't\nwanna capture everything like we were\n\n208\n00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.160\ndoing before.\n\n209\n00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.282\nWhat I wanna do is I wanna say\njust capture the traffic, for\n\n210\n00:11:29.282 --> 00:11:31.481\ninstance on channel six here.\n\n211\n00:11:31.481 --> 00:11:34.901\nAnd that might help speed up things.\n\n212\n00:11:34.901 --> 00:11:37.381\nNow, let me make sure of my typing here.\n\n213\n00:11:37.381 --> 00:11:41.432\nNow that we have our command in,\nairdump, we're gonna tell it,\n\n214\n00:11:41.432 --> 00:11:46.231\ncapture the initialization vectors from\nthis access point on this channel.\n\n215\n00:11:46.231 --> 00:11:50.200\nIn this case, channel six,\nand then the interface.\n\n216\n00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.060\nNow I also have, you have to keep in mind,\n\n217\n00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.410\nthat I've got a packet\ninjection going on back here.\n\n218\n00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:58.690\nThe network adapter is sending\ninformation into this access point.\n\n219\n00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.170\nNow what's that doing?\n\n220\n00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:03.890\nThat ARP response, we've talked\nabout some of those protocols.\n\n221\n00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.120\nIt's responding back to me.\n\n222\n00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.040\nAnd one of the things that it's\ndoing when it responds back to me is\n\n223\n00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.880\nevery individual response has one of those\ninitialization vectors in clear text.\n\n224\n00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.130\nSo to do this,\nwhat I have to do is sit here and\n\n225\n00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.300\ncapture frames after frames after frames.\n\n226\n00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.010\nTo gather those\ninitialization vectors up so\n\n227\n00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:27.110\nthat we can take this information and\ndo a statistical analysis attack.\n\n228\n00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.440\nDump it right into air cracking and\n\n229\n00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.780\ntry to reverse engineer the WEP\nkey by what we've gained.\n\n230\n00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:36.054\nSo keep in mind that the initialization\nfactor attack is one of the things that\n\n231\n00:12:36.054 --> 00:12:37.911\nyou use in order to do a WEP crack.\n\n232\n00:12:37.911 --> 00:12:39.663\nNow, we're gonna have to let this run for\n\n233\n00:12:39.663 --> 00:12:42.330\na little while to get enough of\nthose initialization vectors.\n\n234\n00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.480\nAnd Ronnie,\nI think I read somewhere where it's like\n\n235\n00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:50.670\nif you have the 64 bit encryption for WEP,\nit's about 300,000 initialization vectors.\n\n236\n00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:54.520\nWhen they move it up to 128 bit,\nwe know that's really 104 bit encryption,\n\n237\n00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.960\nyou need a little bit more,\nyou need like 1.5 million.\n\n238\n00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.871\nSo it could take a while.\n\n239\n00:12:59.871 --> 00:13:02.131\nSo you have to be patient\non something like this.\n\n240\n00:13:02.131 --> 00:13:05.453\nBut if you think about it, somebody that\nis sitting outside your access point,\n\n241\n00:13:05.453 --> 00:13:08.091\nthey could have a whole entire\nwork day that they could do this.\n\n242\n00:13:08.091 --> 00:13:12.564\nAnd what's even more frightening about\nthis is the more traffic you have on\n\n243\n00:13:12.564 --> 00:13:16.790\nyour networks, the more devices,\nthe faster this attack works.\n\n244\n00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:20.930\nSee, I've only got one network adapter\ncommunicating with that access point.\n\n245\n00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.840\nSo I'm only gathering information for\none device.\n\n246\n00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.223\nAnd you can see it's doing it pretty fast,\nright?\n\n247\n00:13:26.223 --> 00:13:29.895\nWe're up to 28,000 packets\nthat are being injected, and\n\n248\n00:13:29.895 --> 00:13:33.760\nI've got 53,000 frames already\nthat are being captured.\n\n249\n00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.240\nSo, kind of a scary thing, and it's one\nof the reasons you don't want to use WEP.\n\n250\n00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.981\nNow, WPA, its successor,\nyou can also attack it, too.\n\n251\n00:13:42.981 --> 00:13:46.622\nIt's not quite as easy, because they took\ncare of some of the surrounding problems\n\n252\n00:13:46.622 --> 00:13:49.950\nwith it, so you typically have to do\nwhat is known as a brute force attack.\n\n253\n00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:51.760\nAnd, that's where you're\njust gonna statistically\n\n254\n00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.430\ntry to send as much information to\nthe access point trying to crack its key.\n\n255\n00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:59.670\nSo not quite as easy to do with WPA,\ntakes a little bit longer.\n\n256\n00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.659\nBut WEP, Ronnie, as we've seen before,\n\n257\n00:14:01.659 --> 00:14:04.941\nsomebody can crack this in the time\nthat it takes to play a music video.\n\n258\n00:14:04.941 --> 00:14:07.718\n>> And there's no doubt that a lot\nof times that's exactly where you'll\n\n259\n00:14:07.718 --> 00:14:08.291\nsee that too.\n\n260\n00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:09.991\nBut just kinda remember this, right?\n\n261\n00:14:09.991 --> 00:14:14.007\nAs you are working in the field in\nwhatever company you end up working with,\n\n262\n00:14:14.007 --> 00:14:17.384\nif you have to go and take a look\nat their wireless access point,\n\n263\n00:14:17.384 --> 00:14:21.431\nmake sure that if they're running WEP,\nthat you can switch them off that.\n\n264\n00:14:21.431 --> 00:14:25.764\nAnd that is because even though WEP is\nokay for if you just need to say, I do\n\n265\n00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:31.200\nhave some security implemented on it, it\nreally provides no real security at all.\n\n266\n00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.810\nSo make sure you understand that.\n\n267\n00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:36.210\nNow, at home, even though we wouldn't\nrecommend you do that, if you just needed\n\n268\n00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.330\nto tell somebody yes, my access\npoint is secured, perfectly fine.\n\n269\n00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:40.630\nIt doesn't mean that it really is.\n\n270\n00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.930\nAnd that's where the problem comes in.\n\n271\n00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.025\nSo WEP, remember, was actually implemented\nduring the days when they said look\n\n272\n00:14:46.025 --> 00:14:49.945\nwe just need to be able to tell\nsomebody that security is there, but\n\n273\n00:14:49.945 --> 00:14:51.875\nit doesn't really provide any strength or\nsecurity at all.\n\n274\n00:14:51.875 --> 00:14:55.155\nSometimes you also hear WEP then,\nwe probably mentioned this before\n\n275\n00:14:55.155 --> 00:14:58.315\nin other episodes,\nwhere you hear it is better than nothing.\n\n276\n00:14:58.315 --> 00:15:00.760\nOr it's really security in name only.\n\n277\n00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.270\nAnd that's where you see that.\n\n278\n00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.680\nSo, when you do see stuff like this, and\npeople are wondering why they're actually\n\n279\n00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.260\ngetting advantage of very easily, it's\nbecause WEP is actually one of those easy\n\n280\n00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.690\nthings that ends up people with\njust saying, it doesn't matter.\n\n281\n00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:15.230\nAs long as you don't care about it,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n282\n00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.170\nIf you do care about\nthe sensitivity of your data,\n\n283\n00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:19.600\nit's probably not something\nyou'd want to use.\n\n284\n00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.810\n>> That, well spoken there, Ronnie.\n\n285\n00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.200\nWe've talked about before you know.\n\n286\n00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.660\nIt really is better than nothing.\n\n287\n00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.880\nI call it the better than nothing\nsecurity because really all it does is,\n\n288\n00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.350\nit stops the legitimate people\nfrom connecting to your network.\n\n289\n00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.520\nAs you can see if somebody\nhas the tools and\n\n290\n00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:38.400\nutilities behind the scenes, they can\ngo ahead and they can crack into it.\n\n291\n00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.450\nSo I'll tell you what, we're going to\nlet that run in the background here.\n\n292\n00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.460\nWe'll go ahead and\ntalk about some other attacks.\n\n293\n00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.178\nSome of the attacks that we're\ngoing to move in now, Ronnie,\n\n294\n00:15:47.178 --> 00:15:49.600\nI can tell you they're a little\nbit more short ranged.\n\n295\n00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.349\n>> Okay.\n>> That's one of the things to keep in\n\n296\n00:15:51.349 --> 00:15:51.880\nmind here.\n\n297\n00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.295\nWe're going to talk about NFC right?\n\n298\n00:15:53.295 --> 00:15:56.921\nYou've probably heard that acronym on\nthere before and if you haven't let's just\n\n299\n00:15:56.921 --> 00:16:00.046\ngo ahead and brush the dust off it,\nnear field communication, right.\n\n300\n00:16:00.046 --> 00:16:04.336\nYou've probably seen things like maybe\nbeing able to Send information to\n\n301\n00:16:04.336 --> 00:16:08.150\na printer from your device just by\nbeing in close proximity of it.\n\n302\n00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.050\nHow many of you guys\nhave ever had a key file?\n\n303\n00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:11.180\nOr maybe a security card?\n\n304\n00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:11.730\nRight?\n\n305\n00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:15.400\nYou get close to it, you touch it,\nthat's all near field communication.\n\n306\n00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.650\nSo, these type of attacks you have to\nworry about, but in a certain type of near\n\n307\n00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:23.480\nfield communication, the ones that we're\nreally looking at is one that's common.\n\n308\n00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.350\nAlmost every single device out there,\nincluding mobile devices, right?\n\n309\n00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.990\nAnd that's something known as Bluetooth.\n\n310\n00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:33.450\nBluetooth's been around for a while,\nand when it comes to Bluetooth,\n\n311\n00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.820\nthe information is another\nwireless communication,\n\n312\n00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.710\nit's just emanating information\noff of your devices.\n\n313\n00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:40.850\nNow, we're gonna go ahead and\n\n314\n00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.220\nwe're gonna show you how you can gather\na little bit of that information.\n\n315\n00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.600\nSo, what I've got here is I got my phone,\nand\n\n316\n00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.770\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna turn the Bluetooth on.\n\n317\n00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:49.800\nAnd I'm gonna do what they call\nputting it in discover mode so\n\n318\n00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.910\neverybody can see it right,\nI have to connect to devices out there.\n\n319\n00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:58.450\nSo if we, while that's running in were\ngoing to see if we can hack some web here,\n\n320\n00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:01.190\nbut while that's running in\nthe background lets go ahead and\n\n321\n00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:05.000\nlets see if the Bluetooth in\nthis device is up and running.\n\n322\n00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.980\nAnd that's a little\nutility called hciconfig.\n\n323\n00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.700\nI think, it means Human connection\ninterface I think is what that,\n\n324\n00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.190\nmight be controller interface.\n\n325\n00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:17.470\nBut, it basically, let's me know\nthat I got a Bluetooth address.\n\n326\n00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:21.160\nIt also has a mac address just like\nyour wireless network adaptors do.\n\n327\n00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.180\nI can see that it's up and running.\n\n328\n00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.080\nI can see that it's transmitting and\nit's receiving.\n\n329\n00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.980\nAll right, and that's very important.\n\n330\n00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.900\nWe can start to gather information right,\n\n331\n00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:35.790\ntwo of the common attacks that we talk\nabout are what are known as bluejacking.\n\n332\n00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:37.080\nBluejacking, what you'll just remember,\n\n333\n00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:41.050\nis a concept that I'm going to hijack your\ncommunication session to send my data.\n\n334\n00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:45.080\nThe other one that's been around for\na while is called bluesnarfing.\n\n335\n00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:49.030\nNow, that's a little different because\nI'm not trying to connect to you\n\n336\n00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.760\nto send my information.\n\n337\n00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.800\nThis time I'm trying to connect to\nyou cuz I want your information.\n\n338\n00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:55.640\nAnd Ronnie, I tell you,\n\n339\n00:17:55.640 --> 00:18:00.300\nwe do have a couple of utilities, and\nwe got to be careful with this because\n\n340\n00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:04.270\nthese devices can be seen almost\njust by everybody on the network.\n\n341\n00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:07.480\n>> There's no doubt that when we start\ntalking about the ideas of Bluetooth,\n\n342\n00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.200\nas easy as it is for\n\n343\n00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.720\ndevices to get connected, it does lend\nitself to those security vulnerabilities.\n\n344\n00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.650\nOf the idea of bluejacking as\nwell as bluesnarfing as well.\n\n345\n00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:20.420\nThe idea of the NFC, or the Near Field\nCommunication is also another one\n\n346\n00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.640\nthat you keep hearing people\nharping on at all times.\n\n347\n00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.060\nAnd what we have to remember is,\nthe range of these devices.\n\n348\n00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.740\nOne of the easiest ways\nto defeat this by far is,\n\n349\n00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.530\nif you're not needing to use\nthe Bluetooth, turn it off.\n\n350\n00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:34.170\nIs really what the key comes down so,\n\n351\n00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.840\nI don't leave Bluetooth on\non my phone all the time.\n\n352\n00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.850\nI know that there are people that do,\nbut I don't intend to use it that way.\n\n353\n00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:44.200\nIf I'm not using it, there's no reason for\nme to essentially turn on another wireless\n\n354\n00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.160\nantenna so\nthat somebody can get a chance to hack it.\n\n355\n00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.582\n>> Yeah, not to mention the power\n[INAUDIBLE] conservation of your battery\n\n356\n00:18:50.582 --> 00:18:53.030\nlife, is definitely going to ruin it here,\nso.\n\n357\n00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.420\nLet's see if we can discover\na little bit of information.\n\n358\n00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.100\nOne of the things we can us is\nsomething known as hciscan.\n\n359\n00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.860\nAnd again remember, I believe that's\njust human controller interface.\n\n360\n00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.390\nAnd if I do an hci.\n\n361\n00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:05.680\n>> Tool.\n>> Actually, it's hcitool, yeah.\n\n362\n00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.990\nMake sure we're gonna run\na scan from this tool.\n\n363\n00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:10.550\nSo, there's a couple of\nthings that we can do.\n\n364\n00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:13.030\nWe can do hcitool, and then scan.\n\n365\n00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.410\nAnd it'll go through\nthe process of scanning.\n\n366\n00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.740\nNow, keep in mind that I've got my, Ronnie\nyou wanna play and jump on-board here?\n\n367\n00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.800\nI've got my wireless, or my Bluetooth\ndevice here and it is in discover mode, so\n\n368\n00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.730\nit's sending out the information.\n\n369\n00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:25.810\nAll right?\n\n370\n00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:29.850\nNow, I can see that somebody else is\nsending out their information as well,\n\n371\n00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.720\nand that's one of our\ndevelopers back there.\n\n372\n00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.030\nI can see this says that right there.\n\n373\n00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:38.200\nMacbook Pro, so we've got some\nother devices out there, but\n\n374\n00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.970\nkeep in mind guys is your devices.\n\n375\n00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:47.210\nDon't use somebody else's devices because\nthis is not something you should be doing\n\n376\n00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:51.880\nagainst anybody else's device, so we're\ngonna leave poor Rob's Macbook alone,\n\n377\n00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.550\nbut you can see the name\nof my device up there.\n\n378\n00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:55.350\nAll right?\n\n379\n00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.880\nAnd so let's go ahead and show you\nsome of the things that we can do.\n\n380\n00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.520\nSo, first of all,\n\n381\n00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.170\nI know there's information,\nI know there's a device there.\n\n382\n00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.570\nBut I don't know what that device is.\n\n383\n00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:06.170\nWell guess what?\n\n384\n00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:07.080\nWe can find that out too.\n\n385\n00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.750\nIf I turn around and run hcitool,\n\n386\n00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:13.260\nbut this time instead of running\nscan I do an inquiry, all right?\n\n387\n00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.550\nAnd it starts inquiring.\n\n388\n00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.750\nNow, it's not gonna say I just wanna\nfind the MAC address as to the bluetooth\n\n389\n00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.180\ndevices that are on your network.\n\n390\n00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.340\nWanna find out a little bit more\ninformation about these devices.\n\n391\n00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.150\nAll right.\n\n392\n00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:26.220\nNow, notice here,\nit found some information.\n\n393\n00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.620\nAnd I can tell just by\nrelating these back to\n\n394\n00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.720\nthe MAC addresses whose devices these are.\n\n395\n00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.900\nAnd I can take this identifier, like I can\ntell you right now this class identifier,\n\n396\n00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.970\nbluetooth has what's known as COD classes.\n\n397\n00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.120\nRight class of device.\n\n398\n00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.720\nAnd if I look at that\nbluetooth classification I\n\n399\n00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.620\ncan see that it's going to tell me\nit's a networking smart phone right.\n\n400\n00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.190\nI would almost be willing to bet if you\ntake a look at this device here you\n\n401\n00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:53.230\nmight find an Apple product,\nlike maybe a laptop.\n\n402\n00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:55.410\nSo, now, we're starting to profile.\n\n403\n00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:57.390\nRight?\nWe're starting to get some information.\n\n404\n00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.790\nNow, I know what type of device is.\n\n405\n00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.290\nAnd, if I'm not sure what\nkind of device this is.\n\n406\n00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:01.930\nWell, guess what?\n\n407\n00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:02.940\nI can put that OUI.\n\n408\n00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:03.790\nAll right.\nNow,\n\n409\n00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.660\nI'm not going to tell you\nguys what this device is.\n\n410\n00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.770\nRonnie, you want to do me a favor here,\nreal quick?\n\n411\n00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:09.590\n>> Done.\n\n412\n00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:11.810\n>> Can you bring up an OUI\nsearch from the I triple E?\n\n413\n00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:12.992\nJust an OUI search?\n\n414\n00:21:12.992 --> 00:21:17.250\nAnd I gonna have you tag into the OUI and\nsee if you can find, right,\n\n415\n00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.720\nwhat electronic this is, all right?\n\n416\n00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.660\nNow, I told you it's a phone,\n\n417\n00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:25.200\nobviously we're not saying that\nthat's not the case, all right?\n\n418\n00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.060\nAnd I got some digits here,\n\n419\n00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:29.950\nand what we're gonna do is we're\njust gonna go to WireShark.\n\n420\n00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:33.040\nWireShark's got a fantastic\nOUI search tool.\n\n421\n00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.150\nAll right, and\nwe start to get more information about\n\n422\n00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:41.120\nthe bluetooth device that's\nwithin the network, right?\n\n423\n00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.760\nWe found out that using that\nclass identifier there, right?\n\n424\n00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.560\nThat class identifier is letting\nme know what the device is, and\n\n425\n00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.630\nwhat the service is that's running.\n\n426\n00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.069\nSo, Ronnie let's go ahead and type 30.\n\n427\n00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:57.820\nAnd then, it's going to be colon one nine,\ncolon six six.\n\n428\n00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:02.190\nAnd you can almost just just out there and\ngoogle.\n\n429\n00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:06.110\nJust type OUI and\nput OUI search next to it, right?\n\n430\n00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.380\nAnd the search engine will find it for\nyou too.\n\n431\n00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.430\nAnd one of things that it might\ndo is that it might come back and\n\n432\n00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:15.120\ngive you some information\nabout what the device is, and\n\n433\n00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.960\nyou can start to build a case\nagainst what you're gonna hit.\n\n434\n00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.350\nSo, Ronnie,\ndid you come up with what device,\n\n435\n00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:24.600\njust based on the information we got?\n\n436\n00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.180\nWhat kind of phone do\nyou think that might be?\n\n437\n00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.000\n>> It says a Samsung.\n\n438\n00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.310\n>> That's exactly what this is,\nthis is a Samsung S4 Galaxy.\n\n439\n00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.100\nSo, just with that information\nthat I gave Ronnie,\n\n440\n00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.590\nhe can already tell what device I have.\n\n441\n00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:35.410\nSo, you gotta be careful with that one.\n\n442\n00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:39.740\nNow, I can take this information,\nI can go a little bit farther.\n\n443\n00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:40.890\nCan I communicate with the device?\n\n444\n00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:41.480\nWell, guess what.\n\n445\n00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:46.100\nWe've got this layer to ping which is kind\nof cool, I really like, and I could do\n\n446\n00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:51.480\na layer to ping against that device just\nby putting its Mac address there, right?\n\n447\n00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.170\nAnd let's see if we can\ncommunicate with the device.\n\n448\n00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:58.390\nAnd just like we're running\nping on other devices.\n\n449\n00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:03.500\nNow, this is a layer to Bluetooth ping,\nso now I'm communicating with the device.\n\n450\n00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.470\nI know that I have connection.\n\n451\n00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:05.560\nWhy do I have connection, right?\n\n452\n00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.090\nWe always talk about security and\nencryption and Bluetooth\n\n453\n00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:12.880\ncommunications require you to pair up and\nhit security codes, but what's going on?\n\n454\n00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.840\nWell, with this traffic it\ndoesn't require authentication.\n\n455\n00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.490\nIt doesn't ask for it,\nyou don't have to offer it.\n\n456\n00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:26.040\nSo, now I've got my first door, my foot in\nthe door saying that yes I can communicate\n\n457\n00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.820\nwith your information, and like we've seen\nRonnie helps me out profiling the device.\n\n458\n00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.490\nNow, I know that it's a Samsung device.\n\n459\n00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:34.350\nSo, maybe I go out to like XDA developers.\n\n460\n00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:37.930\nAnd I find anything I can on the Samsung\nand what other people have done with\n\n461\n00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:41.830\nSamsung, now, maybe I've got a step\nfurther indicating your information.\n\n462\n00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:44.940\nWhether it's a bluejacking attack, or\nmaybe in this case a bluesnarfing attack.\n\n463\n00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:48.450\n>> Right, these types of attacks that we\njust talked about here at the end for\n\n464\n00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:53.510\nthe wireless, right, really have to do\nwith the idea of being relatively close.\n\n465\n00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:56.890\nTo those devices that we need and so that\nmeans that attacks that tend to go on in\n\n466\n00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:03.470\nthis way, usually are gonna be where\nsomebody is carrying a device or somebody\n\n467\n00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:07.360\nis sitting very near someone, especially\nin the realm of near field communications.\n\n468\n00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:11.390\nA lot of those you have to actually\nbe up on top of the person.\n\n469\n00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:14.970\nJust to be able to make that work because\nthey normally have a fairly small range.\n\n470\n00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.840\nAbout four inches if you\nactually wanna get good signal.\n\n471\n00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.130\nYou might be able to extend\nthat out a little bit.\n\n472\n00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:25.610\nBut Bluetooth can range anywhere between\nthree feet to thirty feet on a regular\n\n473\n00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:26.450\nstandard consumer device.\n\n474\n00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:29.060\nAnd sometimes even Bluetooth\ndifferent types of\n\n475\n00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.600\nthem that can actually go\nout to 300 feet as well.\n\n476\n00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.420\nBut overall though,\nyou don't tend to see them as being\n\n477\n00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:39.080\nreally super heavy attacks from far\naway or even from different areas.\n\n478\n00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:43.040\nSo, in terms of wireless though,\nthose are kind of the most prominent\n\n479\n00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.270\ntypes of attacks that you're\ngenerally going to end up seeing.\n\n480\n00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:49.880\nSo, remember that what we actually talked\nabout in this particular episode, right?\n\n481\n00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:52.500\nWe took a look at some of the replay\nattacks as well as the idea of\n\n482\n00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.710\njamming attacks.\n\n483\n00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:57.160\nThe ability to actually be a little bit\nmore proactive than these attacks and\n\n484\n00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.580\nthat's what we we're worried about.\n\n485\n00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.570\nThe very fact that these\nthings can happen.\n\n486\n00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:01.620\nWe need to understand,\n\n487\n00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.870\nthat hey one of these replay attacks\ncan turn into a jamming attack.\n\n488\n00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:08.450\nWe need to understand some of\nthe weaknesses in the order protocols that\n\n489\n00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:11.100\nwe may use with our wireless as well.\n\n490\n00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:13.990\nLet's take a look at some\nof these new devices and\n\n491\n00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:18.090\nthink about the idea of things like near\nfield communication as well as Bluetooth.\n\n492\n00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:21.010\nThe very fact is, if you're not needing\nthem, in other words if you're not using\n\n493\n00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:25.350\nthem, the safety and the idea behind\nit is very simple, is turn it off.\n\n494\n00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:28.150\nAnd the same thing would go true\nwith even your wireless connection.\n\n495\n00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:31.750\nIf you're not really using it,\nwhy not go ahead and turn it off as well?\n\n496\n00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:35.450\nBut in today's business world, right,\nwe're not gonna be turning off wireless\n\n497\n00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.660\nany time soon, and\nthe proliferation of these BYODs,\n\n498\n00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:42.380\nbring your own device,\nbring your own, BYOD did I say D?\n\n499\n00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.135\nI hope I said D, and not B again.\n\n500\n00:25:44.135 --> 00:25:48.340\n[LAUGH] So, bring your own device is\nactually just beginning to spread and\n\n501\n00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.010\nactually continuing to become more.\n\n502\n00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:52.110\nSo, we're not going to be turning those\n\n",

00:00:15.240\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n4\n00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.950\nAnd today,\nwe're taking a CompTIA Security+.\n\n5\n00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.430\nWe're specifically going to\nget into application attacks.\n\n6\n00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.519\nAnd these are types of attacks that\nwe need to be familiar with as IT\n\n7\n00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.370\nprofessionals.\n\n8\n00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.310\nAnd who better to help us than today,\nMr. Wes Bryan.\n\n9\n00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.160\nAnd who's actually gonna lead us\nthrough some of these security attacks.\n\n10\n00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.870\nSo Wes, what's so\nimportant about application attacks?\n\n11\n00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.190\n>> Well, one of the things that we have to\nworry about is a lot of the communications\n\n12\n00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.990\nthat we use are over the Internet are\ntalking to some kind specific application\n\n13\n00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.940\nserver web server.\n\n14\n00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.330\nWell, you have web based applications\nthey run on the servers and\n\n15\n00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.070\nthey're usually written in the DNA of\ndifferent languages, different rules for\n\n16\n00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.520\ncommunication, kind of like what we\ntalk about when we say protocols.\n\n17\n00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.640\nThey have some kind of format.\n\n18\n00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.214\nWell one of the things that you have\nto be aware of is that some of these\n\n19\n00:01:03.214 --> 00:01:05.240\nlanguages can be exploited.\n\n20\n00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.468\nAnd the server can be listening out for\na certain kind of communication,\n\n21\n00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:14.150\na certain command as part of its normal\nauthorized day to day operations.\n\n22\n00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.350\nBut what happens when a malicious attacker\nknows very, very in depth that language?\n\n23\n00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.244\nAnd knows how to manipulate the language\nthat the server's listening out for\n\n24\n00:01:26.244 --> 00:01:29.110\nexpecting just an authorized\nuser to input.\n\n25\n00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.340\nAnd that's some of the things\nwe're gonna look at,\n\n26\n00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.190\nsome of the different types of\nattacks that you have to be aware of.\n\n27\n00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.535\nSo you can make decisions on being\na little bit more secure in some of\n\n28\n00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:44.080\nthe platforms that you might use if you\nwill, to secure these these servers.\n\n29\n00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.272\n>> Now before we continue\non in that vein there,\n\n30\n00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:49.340\nlet's make sure we understand\nthat term application attack.\n\n31\n00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.944\nA lot of times it's very easy to get\nit confused, if you're starting to put\n\n32\n00:01:53.944 --> 00:01:58.330\nyourself in that foray of where\nyou talk about securing servers.\n\n33\n00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.480\nWell application attacks, even though we\nmight think of well, I know I have things\n\n34\n00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.440\nlike Word running on my computer, a Word\nprocessor or some type of email program.\n\n35\n00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.960\nWell we're normally speaking of directly\nthough a lot of times is what Wes was\n\n36\n00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.010\ncentering in on,\nwhich is the idea of web servers.\n\n37\n00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.960\nSo whenever you hear the idea of\napplication attacks, usually that's where\n\n38\n00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.110\nit's centered around is, what are we\nactually doing to understand what\n\n39\n00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.350\nare some of the different types of attacks\nthat happened against web servers?\n\n40\n00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.960\nAnd a lot of the code that Wes\nis talking about really is about\n\n41\n00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.050\nhow do we actually gain access\ninside of those web servers as well.\n\n42\n00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.840\nSo just kinda be clear about that as well,\ncuz sometimes it's really easy to say,\n\n43\n00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.288\nI know iI need to protect\nmy applications but how?\n\n44\n00:02:34.288 --> 00:02:37.900\nWell web servers do have to have those\ntype of things but at the same time we\n\n45\n00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.930\nalso have to worry about this types of\nattacks that we're about to get into.\n\n46\n00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.490\nSo Wes what's the first thing that\nwe're actually gonna talk about here?\n\n47\n00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.344\n>> Well one of those things that we're\ngonna want to discuss is something known\n\n48\n00:02:46.344 --> 00:02:47.110\nas code execution.\n\n49\n00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.780\nWhen we talk about\narbitrary code execution.\n\n50\n00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.350\nOne of the things that really means for\nus is again, that code that the server is\n\n51\n00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.260\nexpecting to execute,\nwhether it's some kind of SQL statement,\n\n52\n00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.120\nwhether it's some kind of XML\nlogic that it's gonna use.\n\n53\n00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.390\nWell if you can manipulate those\nlanguages, if you can manipulate those\n\n54\n00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.380\nprotocols then what you're gonna\ndo is you're gonna send a piece of\n\n55\n00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.930\nunauthorized code into one of those\napplication servers that are running and\n\n56\n00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.880\nit's gonna perform some\nkind of functionality.\n\n57\n00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.390\nAgain unauthorized, and\n\n58\n00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.310\nagain a lot of times it's gonna be\nsome kind of malicious activity.\n\n59\n00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.470\nNow, you might hear the term\nremote code execution.\n\n60\n00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.470\nWell, what's the difference?\n\n61\n00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.250\nReally, nothing.\n\n62\n00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.989\nArbitrary and remote code execution.\n\n63\n00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.949\nNow which you're talking\nabout is the location.\n\n64\n00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.210\nIf I'm an administrator,\nI'm looking at the server.\n\n65\n00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.280\nI'm seeing arbitrary code execution if\nI'm trying to secure my web server.\n\n66\n00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.984\nBut if you say, remote code execution,\nwell that's the attacker just being in\n\n67\n00:03:41.984 --> 00:03:45.540\na different location, sending the same\ntype of code back into your server.\n\n68\n00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.647\nSo one of the things that we have to\nlook at is the codes in the programming\n\n69\n00:03:49.647 --> 00:03:54.166\nlanguage is they can be manipulated to\nsend extra unauthorized malicious data\n\n70\n00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:57.190\ninto some application or\neven go farther than that.\n\n71\n00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.759\nGo right through\nthe application to the back\n\n72\n00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:03.440\nend where your data is being stored and\npotentially modify it,\n\n73\n00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.691\nexport it if you will, corrupt it,\nto where the whole database is lost.\n\n74\n00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:10.286\nAnd if you think about that,\nif you have a user database,\n\n75\n00:04:10.286 --> 00:04:13.426\nyou have credit card information and\nit's important information,\n\n76\n00:04:13.426 --> 00:04:15.930\nit's vital to your company's success.\n\n77\n00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.694\nAnd if that information first of all,\n\n78\n00:04:17.694 --> 00:04:20.130\nis put to an external source\nthen you have a problem.\n\n79\n00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.730\nYou have payment card\ninformation out there.\n\n80\n00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.156\nYou have potential personal identifiable\ninformation that's out there or\n\n81\n00:04:25.156 --> 00:04:26.770\nwhat if they corrupt the data base?\n\n82\n00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.710\nThey corrupt the data base.\n\n83\n00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.570\nNow you've also got the same problem and\nhopefully, you've got backup.\n\n84\n00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.340\nIt really starts with arbitrary code\nexecution and remote again like I said,\n\n85\n00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.936\nis just because you're typically\nthe attacker's not gonna be on the same\n\n86\n00:04:38.936 --> 00:04:39.760\nnetwork as you.\n\n87\n00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.820\nAnd if they are you've got bigger\nproblems than you really know.\n\n88\n00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.160\nSo we have to look at that.\n\n89\n00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.280\nHow does this start?\n\n90\n00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.500\nWell it starts with something\nknown as header manipulation.\n\n91\n00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.928\nWhen you talk about communicating\nwith a application,\n\n92\n00:04:51.928 --> 00:04:56.918\na lot of times out in front of that\ndata is header information and\n\n93\n00:04:56.918 --> 00:05:03.530\nit's usually I say usually, but we hope\nthat it is data that we're looking to see.\n\n94\n00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.256\nIf the attacker decides to\nput that code in the header,\n\n95\n00:05:07.256 --> 00:05:12.209\nthen when it's sent into the application\nitself that code can execute.\n\n96\n00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:14.630\nSo they kind of run hand in hand when\nwe talk about code execution and\n\n97\n00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.549\nheader manipulations.\n\n98\n00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:19.598\nAnd header manipulations\nreally form the basis for\n\n99\n00:05:19.598 --> 00:05:24.129\na lot of the other attacks\nwe're gonna talk today about.\n\n100\n00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:26.505\nOne of the first one's I would\nsay we gotta look at is known as,\n\n101\n00:05:26.505 --> 00:05:29.170\nmaybe you've heard about out\nthere cross side scripting.\n\n102\n00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.338\nNow, there's acronyms for this as well,\n\n103\n00:05:31.338 --> 00:05:34.532\nXSS you might see this if you ever\nlook into browser settings and\n\n104\n00:05:34.532 --> 00:05:38.040\na lot of times you're web browsers\nthey try to protect you from this.\n\n105\n00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.803\nThat they've got them built into\nthings like Internet Explorer, Chrome,\n\n106\n00:05:41.803 --> 00:05:43.280\nFirefox has them and Safari.\n\n107\n00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.500\nWell what is a cross\nside scripting attack?\n\n108\n00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.110\nWell if we take a look\nhere at my computer.\n\n109\n00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.880\nWhat ends up happening is you\nhave an attacker out here.\n\n110\n00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.529\nAnd with the attacker,\n\n111\n00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:58.819\nthe first thing that the attacker does\nis bounces some script HTML dynamic.\n\n112\n00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.557\nAnd when you connect to\nthat application and\n\n113\n00:06:01.557 --> 00:06:06.150\nthe HTMLs delivered back to your browser,\nyou see the webpage rendered.\n\n114\n00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.010\nYou don't see all the code\nin the background.\n\n115\n00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.600\nWell, if the attacker can put code\ninto that HTML on the web page,\n\n116\n00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.210\nthen what happens here is now that the\nattacker has embedded that information.\n\n117\n00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.986\nWhen a victim connected over the Internet\nback into the server itself,\n\n118\n00:06:22.986 --> 00:06:25.540\nwhat happens is the script executes.\n\n119\n00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.544\nSo that's the cross side scripting,\n\n120\n00:06:27.544 --> 00:06:31.239\nwhat it means is the script is delivered\ndirectly to the web browser and\n\n121\n00:06:31.239 --> 00:06:34.270\nthe end user might not even\nbe aware that it happens.\n\n122\n00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.230\nWhy?\n\n123\n00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.094\nThey don't see the XML not the XML excuse\nme, the HTML different language there.\n\n124\n00:06:39.094 --> 00:06:42.175\n[LAUGH] They don't see\nthe HTML that's underneath.\n\n125\n00:06:42.175 --> 00:06:46.896\nSo they might go completely unaware of\nthe fact that an attacker has stored their\n\n126\n00:06:46.896 --> 00:06:48.595\ninformation on the server.\n\n127\n00:06:48.595 --> 00:06:52.638\nI connect to it via web browser,\nthat script sent back to my web browser on\n\n128\n00:06:52.638 --> 00:06:56.634\nmy local machine executes and\ncauses some kind of malicious activity.\n\n129\n00:06:56.634 --> 00:07:00.430\nAgain, whatever I think about it caused\nsome kind of unauthorized activity.\n\n130\n00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.850\nMalicious, it could be something\nas simple as wiping your data.\n\n131\n00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.720\nIt could be even more than that it\ncould be gathering your information and\n\n132\n00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.690\nsending it outbound.\n\n133\n00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.010\nSo whatever the functionality\nof the script is.\n\n134\n00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.560\nSo Ronnie,\n\n135\n00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.120\nthat's one of the first things we gotta\nlook at is the cross-side scripting.\n\n136\n00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.420\nAnd there's different types of cross-side\nscripting attacks, but more generically\n\n137\n00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.440\nit's either stored on the server or\nit's reflected off of the server.\n\n138\n00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.080\nBut either way,\n\n139\n00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.370\nwhat happens is that the script itself\nis in the language, in the HTML.\n\n140\n00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.360\nThe victim is unaware that it's there.\n\n141\n00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.449\nIt's delivered to the web browser, it does\nwhatever the code's supposed to execute\n\n142\n00:07:31.449 --> 00:07:33.909\nand now we've got a problem\non our local networks.\n\n143\n00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:37.999\n>> So with the cross eyed scripting\nwhat we really have to worry about,\n\n144\n00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:42.690\nis the very fact that we can actually get\nthe code that comes off of the server.\n\n145\n00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.205\nAnd it does something on our machine\nthrough the browser that we have and\n\n146\n00:07:46.205 --> 00:07:48.912\na lot of times that can just\ndo anything that we want to.\n\n147\n00:07:48.912 --> 00:07:51.580\nMost of the time what attackers\nare really trying to do\n\n148\n00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.375\nis also steal that session cookie so\nthat they can actually be able to connect\n\n149\n00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:59.377\nback to that web server as if they're\nactually us without having to break that.\n\n150\n00:07:59.377 --> 00:08:01.306\nThat connection.\n\n151\n00:08:01.306 --> 00:08:04.359\nSo that way anything they send to\nthe actual server actually looks like\n\n152\n00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:06.400\nit's also coming from us as well.\n\n153\n00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.592\nSo remember that what Wes is actually\ntalking about up to this point is\n\n154\n00:08:09.592 --> 00:08:12.520\njust establishing the bare basics\nthat we need to understand.\n\n155\n00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.251\nThe idea of header manipulation,\n\n156\n00:08:14.251 --> 00:08:17.540\nunderstanding that code is gonna\nexecute on that remote server.\n\n157\n00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.071\nThis is something if you're\nnot really dealing or\n\n158\n00:08:20.071 --> 00:08:23.790\nyou are used to dealing with\nthe idea of code execution.\n\n159\n00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.080\nWe know that we can run\ncode on our own machines.\n\n160\n00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.470\nWe've all done this on a Window's machine,\nwhere we just click on a button.\n\n161\n00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.470\nWell that runs here.\n\n162\n00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.215\nBut what is it that I have to do to\nactually be able to execute that\n\n163\n00:08:34.215 --> 00:08:36.350\nwhile on another machine instead.\n\n164\n00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.232\nAnd that's where that\nremote code execution and\n\n165\n00:08:39.232 --> 00:08:41.810\narbitrary code execution also comes in.\n\n166\n00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:45.860\nFrom that point the way that we begin to\ndo it is what Wes also described using\n\n167\n00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.400\nheader manipulation at\nthe very beginning to say,\n\n168\n00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.520\nI need to send something\nover to this server.\n\n169\n00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.850\nAnd whatever the server sends\nback then we can respond\n\n170\n00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.310\nto that to get us where we\nwant to is really the key.\n\n171\n00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.480\nAnd one of the most basic attacks here is\nwhat we call that cross-site scripting\n\n172\n00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.600\nWes, there's a lot more besides cross-site\nscripting which is really just us\n\n173\n00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.600\ngetting some information,\nmaybe from the web page a lot of times.\n\n174\n00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.570\nYou said that we could connect in, and\n\n175\n00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.650\nsometimes even get access to the back\nend of the database itself, right?\n\n176\n00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.630\n>> Yeah, that's something through\nwhat's known as a SQL injection attack.\n\n177\n00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.918\nAnd I don't really understand a lot\nabout the standard query language but\n\n178\n00:09:21.918 --> 00:09:26.620\nSQL it follows a format and a format that\nevery database server is gonna respond to\n\n179\n00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.870\nwhen it gets that query for information.\n\n180\n00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.550\nWhat if I'm not sending\nauthorized statements?\n\n181\n00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:37.665\nWhat if I'm not asking it for\nlegitimate information if I'm an attacker?\n\n182\n00:09:37.665 --> 00:09:40.690\nWell, since the SQL database\nis sitting there listening for\n\n183\n00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.901\nthose incoming statements, what says that\nI can't send my malicious statements or\n\n184\n00:09:44.901 --> 00:09:47.290\nmy malicious information\ninto that database.\n\n185\n00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:48.910\nSo if we look on our machine here.\n\n186\n00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:54.330\nWe've got the ability to send that\ninformation into the server here.\n\n187\n00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.279\nOne of the things that we could do,\n\n188\n00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:59.989\nis we could send that information\nto the back end of the database.\n\n189\n00:09:59.989 --> 00:10:01.129\nWell, what are the databases?\n\n190\n00:10:01.129 --> 00:10:03.390\nA lot of times they're\ngonna be SQL databases.\n\n191\n00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.110\nWell, what are SQL?\n\n192\n00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.790\nSQL a standard query language.\n\n193\n00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:12.490\nIt is a standardized way to get\ninformation in and out of a database.\n\n194\n00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:16.816\nWell, there's nothing that really says\nthat if I'm a malicious user, that I can't\n\n195\n00:10:16.816 --> 00:10:20.310\nsend a request for information if\nyou will, in to your database.\n\n196\n00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:24.000\nSo one of the things we can do, we take\na look at the computer here, I can send\n\n197\n00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.380\nnormal SQL command, SQL statements if\nyou will, in to the server itself.\n\n198\n00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:32.554\nAnd if I don't have what's known as\ninput validation making sure that\n\n199\n00:10:32.554 --> 00:10:37.165\nthe requests that are being sent are valid\nand coming from authorized users.\n\n200\n00:10:37.165 --> 00:10:41.631\nThen what's to say that we can't send\none of these into the server and\n\n201\n00:10:41.631 --> 00:10:46.559\nnow unfortunately, it outputs all of\nthe users from a particular column and\n\n202\n00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:48.954\nthen maybe deletes the staff table.\n\n203\n00:10:48.954 --> 00:10:53.245\nSo not only is it pulling information out\nof our database but that it also says,\n\n204\n00:10:53.245 --> 00:10:57.680\nwell go ahead and delete that information\nin the database and that's a problem.\n\n205\n00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.270\nRemember where your credit card\ninformation might be stored.\n\n206\n00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.853\nYour users might be and\n\n207\n00:11:01.853 --> 00:11:07.000\nit doesn't have to be user information\nas far as credit card payments.\n\n208\n00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.390\nIt could be anything that\nyou store in that database.\n\n209\n00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.510\nAnd the reason that we call this\nan application attack is because it's\n\n210\n00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.280\nusually the web application\nthat you enter data into and\n\n211\n00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.320\nit goes through the web application\nback into your database.\n\n212\n00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.360\nWell, if you don't check that input\nwhat's to say when that form comes\n\n213\n00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.820\nup that I can't just put\nSQL statement in there and\n\n214\n00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:30.170\ninject it right into your database\nperforming whatever action I need to.\n\n215\n00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.012\nSending the information back to me,\ncollecting that information,\n\n216\n00:11:33.012 --> 00:11:36.099\ndeleting information, adding my own\nentries into you're own database.\n\n217\n00:11:36.099 --> 00:11:39.800\nIt could be something just as\nmuch corrupting your database.\n\n218\n00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.900\nOne little corruption and\nthe whole database is ruined.\n\n219\n00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.733\nSo these could be very nasty attacks and\nthere will,\n\n220\n00:11:45.733 --> 00:11:48.440\nit's a very high level in severity.\n\n221\n00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.726\nJust because of the fact that all of our\ninformation is stored in the database, and\n\n222\n00:11:51.726 --> 00:11:54.360\nwe really wanna make sure that\nit maintains its integrity.\n\n223\n00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.960\nSo that's one of the first injection type\nattacks that we really have to look at.\n\n224\n00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.560\n>> Now, what we're actually\ntaking a look at now then.\n\n225\n00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.894\nWhen we start talking about\nthat SQL injection cuz a lot of\n\n226\n00:12:04.894 --> 00:12:06.430\ntimes it's fairly easy.\n\n227\n00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.960\nYou get access to a website and\nall of a sudden,\n\n228\n00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.170\nyou go that looks like a nice website.\n\n229\n00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.750\nAnd what an attacker will do is that\nthey'll actually see if there's a sign in\n\n230\n00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:17.920\nor a log in type of form is that they'll\ngo to that login page where they\n\n231\n00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.600\nhave a you know boxes one for\nuser name and one for\n\n232\n00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.090\npassword just say something that simple.\n\n233\n00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:26.540\nAnd what will happen instead is that they\nwill test to see if they can get access\n\n234\n00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.140\nin to the databases in the background.\n\n235\n00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:33.260\nThe way that they do so is by typing in\nthose types of statements that Wes was\n\n236\n00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.599\ntalking about, SQL statements\nto see if they can run code.\n\n237\n00:12:36.599 --> 00:12:39.649\nSo that should go into the user name and\nthey can type in let's say,\n\n238\n00:12:39.649 --> 00:12:43.010\nselect statements or delete statements or\nalter table statements.\n\n239\n00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:48.310\nWell then they go ahead and they press\nconfirm or whatever it is, sign in.\n\n240\n00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:52.770\nAnd now they actually get a return\nthat comes back that is a SQL return.\n\n241\n00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:55.537\nEven if it's an error,\nwhat does that really mean?\n\n242\n00:12:55.537 --> 00:12:58.768\nWell the SQL injection,\nwhat that really does mean is that look,\n\n243\n00:12:58.768 --> 00:13:01.118\nit didn't just go hey,\nwe're sending this and\n\n244\n00:13:01.118 --> 00:13:05.030\nthen it's gonna actually get sent to\nthe database and return something.\n\n245\n00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:07.974\nIt literally actually\ngot directly a connect,\n\n246\n00:13:07.974 --> 00:13:11.440\nin other words the command\ndirectly hit a SQL database.\n\n247\n00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.858\nIf they can do that through\nyour web front end,\n\n248\n00:13:13.858 --> 00:13:17.642\nthat means that they can have a direct\nconnection into the database, and\n\n249\n00:13:17.642 --> 00:13:21.320\nthey can now start sending those\ndifferent types of commands into it.\n\n250\n00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:26.001\nAnd so this is something that is very\nimportant, that a lot of times those\n\n251\n00:13:26.001 --> 00:13:30.990\nforms that are actually created so that\nwe can fill in things like user name and\n\n252\n00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:35.490\npasswords and street addresses and\neven email or apartment number.\n\n253\n00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:38.680\nThey can put any type of\ncommand in any of those fields,\n\n254\n00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.480\nand they can get a response\nback from the database.\n\n255\n00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:46.170\nWell that says, look the database front\nend is really nothing but a curtain.\n\n256\n00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.410\nAnd all they have to do is\nactually open the curtain up, and\n\n257\n00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.030\nthen they can get access to the database.\n\n258\n00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.746\nWell that is just a gold mine for\n\n259\n00:13:51.746 --> 00:13:55.659\nmost attackers that are actually\ntrying to execute this type of code.\n\n260\n00:13:55.659 --> 00:13:58.860\nAnd that's what you have to realize,\nis that that can be done.\n\n261\n00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.667\nAnd so most of the time, we have to put\nup some type of protection to ensure that\n\n262\n00:14:02.667 --> 00:14:04.910\nthings like that are not\ngonna happen to us.\n\n263\n00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.060\nSo SQL types of injection attacks.\n\n264\n00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.126\nThey can be done so easily,\nwhere what can happen is,\n\n265\n00:14:10.126 --> 00:14:14.761\nif they specially know that you're a large\ncompany, is that they can go ahead and\n\n266\n00:14:14.761 --> 00:14:17.710\ndelete the entire users table or\ncustomers table.\n\n267\n00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:21.707\nAnd now imagine that, and now all of\nthe data that's supposed to be for you so\n\n268\n00:14:21.707 --> 00:14:24.370\nyou can build your customers is now gone.\n\n269\n00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.019\nThat would be pretty\nupsetting wouldn't it Wes?\n\n270\n00:14:26.019 --> 00:14:26.879\n>> Absolutely.\n\n271\n00:14:26.879 --> 00:14:31.040\nAnd again it's one of those reasons\nyou've gotta keep those databases secure.\n\n272\n00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:35.493\nNow one of the next ones that we have is\nanother form of an injection intact and\n\n273\n00:14:35.493 --> 00:14:38.380\nagain, this is this is still a database.\n\n274\n00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.770\nThis is more of a directory\nservice based database.\n\n275\n00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:43.140\nI know that's a little redundant there.\n\n276\n00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.939\nThis is what's known as\nan LDAP injection attack.\n\n277\n00:14:45.939 --> 00:14:49.093\nAnd if we look here at the computer,\none of the things that\n\n278\n00:14:49.093 --> 00:14:52.799\nyou do is you send an LDAP statement\ninto your directory database.\n\n279\n00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:55.060\nFor instance,\nmaybe it's a domain controller.\n\n280\n00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.225\nActive Directory if you're\nin a Windows domain.\n\n281\n00:14:57.225 --> 00:15:01.024\nAnd what the attacker does,\nis they try to craft a LDAP but\n\n282\n00:15:01.024 --> 00:15:06.340\nagain help you out with the acronym,\nlight weight directory access protocol.\n\n283\n00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.080\nIt's the rules for communication for\ninteracting with a directory service.\n\n284\n00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.800\nSo what do they do?\n\n285\n00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.140\nThey send in information.\n\n286\n00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.290\nThey find maybe a valid username.\n\n287\n00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:16.854\nWe know that maybe a David Smith\nworks with the company,\n\n288\n00:15:16.854 --> 00:15:19.202\nthe attackers done some\nresearch in engineering,\n\n289\n00:15:19.202 --> 00:15:22.440\nso they know that there potentially\nis a user name with Smith in there.\n\n290\n00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.320\nSo what do they do?\n\n291\n00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.160\nThey send a statement that bypasses\na valid user's authentication.\n\n292\n00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.130\nNow they've logged in which\nis kind of interesting.\n\n293\n00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:34.380\nThey've logged in as that valid user Smith\nand they've bypassed the authentication.\n\n294\n00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.510\nNow, we can go a little\nbit further than that.\n\n295\n00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.560\nIf they're doing their\nsocial engineering and\n\n296\n00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.636\nthey're trying to find out maybe\nyou've got top secret information,\n\n297\n00:15:41.636 --> 00:15:44.879\nmaybe you've got secret information\nclassified as high level security.\n\n298\n00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:49.483\nWhat's to say that we can't send a LDAP\nstatement into your database that says,\n\n299\n00:15:49.483 --> 00:15:51.863\nlook for every single document in there.\n\n300\n00:15:51.863 --> 00:15:55.382\nEvery document, and then output it\nback to me and I'll collect it or\n\n301\n00:15:55.382 --> 00:15:59.238\nmaybe even put a filter in there that\nsays, look for high level security.\n\n302\n00:15:59.238 --> 00:16:03.757\nRight now, all I want is to output every\nsingle document that's represented as\n\n303\n00:16:03.757 --> 00:16:08.008\nan object within your database back\nto that computer, and now I've your,\n\n304\n00:16:08.008 --> 00:16:11.193\nwhatever your secret or\nconfidential information is.\n\n305\n00:16:11.193 --> 00:16:15.859\nSo, it's a manipulation on the LDAP\nprotocol because again, remember servers.\n\n306\n00:16:15.859 --> 00:16:17.948\nWe're talking about client server model,\n\n307\n00:16:17.948 --> 00:16:20.549\nwe're talking about a request\nresponse type nature.\n\n308\n00:16:20.549 --> 00:16:25.280\nWell, when I send a request in maliciously\nI can get the response back if I\n\n309\n00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.933\nknow how to write the statement itself.\n\n310\n00:16:27.933 --> 00:16:32.004\nSo, LAP injection attacks are ones\nthat play on directory services,\n\n311\n00:16:32.004 --> 00:16:35.317\nservers that are running\ndirectory service databases.\n\n312\n00:16:35.317 --> 00:16:39.203\nAnd they try to manipulate\nthe information, bypass authentication all\n\n313\n00:16:39.203 --> 00:16:42.578\ntogether, or destroy information,\nor even outsource it, or\n\n314\n00:16:42.578 --> 00:16:46.926\noutput it back to the computer and collect\nit and use it for other attacks as well.\n\n315\n00:16:46.926 --> 00:16:50.596\nYou gotta keep in mind that inside of your\ndirectory service you have a blueprint of\n\n316\n00:16:50.596 --> 00:16:53.110\nevery object inside of your\nentire corporate network.\n\n317\n00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.440\nSo if I can gain access to that\ninformation, we're talking about\n\n318\n00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.550\nthe potential to exploit it and\neven lead into other vulnerabilities.\n\n319\n00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:04.240\nIf I've got things like your DNS records,\nI know what your IP addresses are,\n\n320\n00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.160\nwhat your computer names are.\n\n321\n00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.670\nAnd this was another\none that can implement\n\n322\n00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.870\na lot of vulnerabilities that can be\nused to go a lot farther than that.\n\n323\n00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:15.600\nSo this is another one of those, Ronnie,\nthose injection attacks that we have to be\n\n324\n00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.551\ncareful with as well,\nbecause it could cause some big problems.\n\n325\n00:17:18.551 --> 00:17:23.132\nAnd most corporate companies are gonna be\nrunning some kind of directory service to\n\n326\n00:17:23.132 --> 00:17:24.774\nkeep track of those objects.\n\n327\n00:17:24.774 --> 00:17:27.726\n>> So what we're actually seeing here in\nthese types of injection attacks, right,\n\n328\n00:17:27.726 --> 00:17:30.250\nremember that the SQL database itself,\nor the SQL injection attack,\n\n329\n00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:31.554\nexcuse me, not just the database.\n\n330\n00:17:31.554 --> 00:17:35.209\nThe SQL injection attack itself,\ncan lead itself to be an attack and\n\n331\n00:17:35.209 --> 00:17:39.122\nit actually has an end to that attack,\nwhich could be deleting records or\n\n332\n00:17:39.122 --> 00:17:41.270\nmodifying or changing those.\n\n333\n00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:45.020\nWith the idea of the LDAP type of\ninjection attack, that is really not\n\n334\n00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.870\nthe ultimate end right, is to take\nadvantage of just that protocol.\n\n335\n00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:52.820\nThe ultimate end there is to actually\nsend that type of query that we have.\n\n336\n00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:57.420\nAnd if a response is triggered,\njust like we talked about in SQL, then\n\n337\n00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.710\nthe user knows that, hey, they can use\nthis as a method to gain access to those\n\n338\n00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:05.400\ndifferent objects that Wes was actually\nspeaking about inside of that database.\n\n339\n00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:10.250\nSo in this particular nature of what\nthe LDAP injection attack really does,\n\n340\n00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.070\nis it opens another doorway.\n\n341\n00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:16.391\nFor us to get more information, for us to\nbe able to take a little bit more time,\n\n342\n00:18:16.391 --> 00:18:20.468\nand that should be able to run through\nthat entirety of the LDAP database.\n\n343\n00:18:20.468 --> 00:18:24.270\nSo, this one is not like, okay,\nI carried out an LDAP injection, and\n\n344\n00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.273\nthen what's the end result of that?\n\n345\n00:18:26.273 --> 00:18:29.579\nThe end result is that you've opened\nup a door that maybe that somebody\n\n346\n00:18:29.579 --> 00:18:33.518\nwho's running that web application\ndoesn't understand that you've opened up.\n\n347\n00:18:33.518 --> 00:18:37.419\nAnd what you do is you just take advantage\nof it, and that way you can get access.\n\n348\n00:18:37.419 --> 00:18:38.951\nYou know exactly where those objects are.\n\n349\n00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:41.771\nYou know how to get access to\ncertain items inside of that\n\n350\n00:18:41.771 --> 00:18:44.663\nnetwork without you having\nto do much more exploration.\n\n351\n00:18:44.663 --> 00:18:47.257\nWhereas in the SQL type of\ninjection attack, right,\n\n352\n00:18:47.257 --> 00:18:50.774\nwe can literally modify the entire\nstructure of the database by adding in\n\n353\n00:18:50.774 --> 00:18:53.672\ncolumns or deleting columns,\nusually it's deleting it.\n\n354\n00:18:53.672 --> 00:18:58.363\nOr even trying to change a way that\nthe information's actually there too.\n\n355\n00:18:58.363 --> 00:19:02.026\nNow the other one that we also have\nthat's an injection type of attack,\n\n356\n00:19:02.026 --> 00:19:04.725\nis one that we call an XML\ntype of injection, right?\n\n357\n00:19:04.725 --> 00:19:06.296\n>> Yep, absolutely, and Ronnie,\n\n358\n00:19:06.296 --> 00:19:10.065\nthis is no different than some of the ones\nthat we've been discussing, right?\n\n359\n00:19:10.065 --> 00:19:13.081\nJust like Ronnie's mentioned,\nthese are all different programs or\n\n360\n00:19:13.081 --> 00:19:15.684\nprotocols we use the language\nto manipulate the protocol.\n\n361\n00:19:15.684 --> 00:19:18.318\nWell, XML here,\nExtensible Markup Language,\n\n362\n00:19:18.318 --> 00:19:21.025\nthis is one that seeks to\nexploit the logic of XML.\n\n363\n00:19:21.025 --> 00:19:24.148\nSo if we look at our computer here,\n\n364\n00:19:24.148 --> 00:19:29.106\nmaybe we've got an account\nthat's being stored, and\n\n365\n00:19:29.106 --> 00:19:35.700\nthe account amount is,\nlet's say $54,675 and change, right?\n\n366\n00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:40.595\nWell, if I can manipulate the XML logic,\nwhat is to say that I can't send a tag,\n\n367\n00:19:40.595 --> 00:19:43.826\nan XML tag if you will,\ninto that database, right?\n\n368\n00:19:43.826 --> 00:19:47.913\nAnd then what it does is it\noverwrites information, right?\n\n369\n00:19:47.913 --> 00:19:52.789\nSo the original account data was 54\nalmost 55,000 but what did we do?\n\n370\n00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:56.649\nWell, we decided that we're gonna\nmanipulate the logic to reset or\n\n371\n00:19:56.649 --> 00:19:58.826\noverwrite that value down to a penny.\n\n372\n00:19:58.826 --> 00:20:00.397\nNow we've got a problem here,\n\n373\n00:20:00.397 --> 00:20:04.213\nwe're just manipulating the data\nthat's being stored in this database.\n\n374\n00:20:04.213 --> 00:20:05.382\nWe could override it and\n\n375\n00:20:05.382 --> 00:20:09.357\nreally just exploit the logic of the\nExtensible Markup Language, and really not\n\n376\n00:20:09.357 --> 00:20:12.990\ntoo much different than when you talk\nabout embedding something in HTML.\n\n377\n00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:17.309\nOr if you talk about, again,\nmaking statements into a SQL server here.\n\n378\n00:20:17.309 --> 00:20:22.046\nThis is another one that just exploits the\nlogic of the Extensible Markup Language.\n\n379\n00:20:22.046 --> 00:20:26.799\n>> Yeah, XML data is actually one\nof the weird ways that we also hold\n\n380\n00:20:26.799 --> 00:20:29.012\na lot of data in one location.\n\n381\n00:20:29.012 --> 00:20:31.838\nDon't get me wrong,\nSQL databases are very popular, and\n\n382\n00:20:31.838 --> 00:20:34.445\nthey do have a structure that\nfalls in line with them.\n\n383\n00:20:34.445 --> 00:20:38.869\nBut for more performance and more speed,\nXML databases have become popular and\n\n384\n00:20:38.869 --> 00:20:41.330\nyou're starting to see that as well.\n\n385\n00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:44.520\nAnd the problem with these types of\ndatabases is that they are structured\n\n386\n00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:49.280\nalmost like webpages, where you tag all\nthe data and you create tags on your own.\n\n387\n00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.310\nSo in other words, there's no set way\nthat these tags actually have to form.\n\n388\n00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.100\nThe advantage of that,\nright, is the weakness also.\n\n389\n00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.031\nThe advantage of that is it's very quick,\nright.\n\n390\n00:20:58.031 --> 00:21:01.118\nSomebody can actually create an XML\ndatabase very quickly because you create\n\n391\n00:21:01.118 --> 00:21:03.968\nwhatever tags you want to as long as\neverybody understands those tags,\n\n392\n00:21:03.968 --> 00:21:05.787\nit's gonna be stored that way,\nno big deal.\n\n393\n00:21:05.787 --> 00:21:10.802\nBut now, by doing that, right, if I know\nthat there's a weakness in being able to\n\n394\n00:21:10.802 --> 00:21:15.399\nget access to that XML type of database,\nthat means exactly what Wes said.\n\n395\n00:21:15.399 --> 00:21:17.577\nI can now create my own tags, and\n\n396\n00:21:17.577 --> 00:21:21.715\nsee if I can now inject information\ninto that same database.\n\n397\n00:21:21.715 --> 00:21:24.994\nAnd either I'm removing, like what\nWes did, the money that's there, or\n\n398\n00:21:24.994 --> 00:21:28.031\nI'm actually increasing my own\naccount by doing it at the same time.\n\n399\n00:21:28.031 --> 00:21:29.424\n>> Sure enough, [LAUGH].\n\n400\n00:21:29.424 --> 00:21:33.300\n>> So you do have to be careful,\nand all of these again fall not,\n\n401\n00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:37.412\nthe weakness behind them is not\nbecause they're bad programs.\n\n402\n00:21:37.412 --> 00:21:42.191\nIn other words, there's no malicious\nintent behind these program themselves,\n\n403\n00:21:42.191 --> 00:21:43.309\nSQL or LDAP or XML.\n\n404\n00:21:43.309 --> 00:21:48.649\nBut it's the very fact that they're built\naround the idea of functionality and\n\n405\n00:21:48.649 --> 00:21:52.086\nof efficiency,\nrather than the idea of security.\n\n406\n00:21:52.086 --> 00:21:54.083\nAnd that's where we also have a problem.\n\n407\n00:21:54.083 --> 00:21:57.230\nSo we do have to worry about this,\nand the reason why is because, well,\n\n408\n00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:00.998\nthat's the machine that we're\nexposing out, well, to the Internet.\n\n409\n00:22:00.998 --> 00:22:04.979\nAnd you gotta actually realize that\nany time somebody can put data in from\n\n410\n00:22:04.979 --> 00:22:09.742\nthe outside of your network, coming inside\nof your network, you gotta actually say,\n\n411\n00:22:09.742 --> 00:22:14.047\nhey look, there's a potential for\nwhatever that input is to be dangerous, or\n\n412\n00:22:14.047 --> 00:22:16.210\nto be adverse to what you want.\n\n413\n00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:20.440\nAnd that's where you have to begin the\nidea of protection right there as well.\n\n414\n00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.960\nSo Wes, when we talk about\ninjection types of attacks then,\n\n415\n00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:29.220\nyou had mentioned it, but\nlet's describe it a little bit more here.\n\n416\n00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.820\nSo what is this idea of input\nvalidation that we're worrying about?\n\n417\n00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:36.800\n>> That's right, so input validation\njust means that if I give you a form and\n\n418\n00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.672\nyou're gonna fill it out online.\n\n419\n00:22:38.672 --> 00:22:40.785\nRemember, we're talking about\napplication attacks here, so\n\n420\n00:22:40.785 --> 00:22:43.455\nwe gotta have an application on the front\nend regardless what's on the back end.\n\n421\n00:22:43.455 --> 00:22:47.449\nWhether it's an LDAP server, whether it's\nan XML server, Logic, whether it's SQL.\n\n422\n00:22:47.449 --> 00:22:52.171\nWell, it just means that when I send you\na form and it's got fields to fill out,\n\n423\n00:22:52.171 --> 00:22:56.272\nthat when you put data in there,\nit's the data that I expect to see.\n\n424\n00:22:56.272 --> 00:23:00.266\nIt's the data that the database\nauthorized expects to see.\n\n425\n00:23:00.266 --> 00:23:04.846\nSo it's not gonna be something that where,\nI give you a form that says password, and\n\n426\n00:23:04.846 --> 00:23:08.021\nyou put 150 in brackets plus 1,\nright, in brackets.\n\n427\n00:23:08.021 --> 00:23:11.457\nAnd then you send that in to the server,\nand now you've bypassed some kind of\n\n428\n00:23:11.457 --> 00:23:13.826\nauthentication mechanism or\nsomething like that.\n\n429\n00:23:13.826 --> 00:23:18.427\nBasically, what it says is that, if you\nare gonna put information in a form when\n\n430\n00:23:18.427 --> 00:23:22.975\nyou connect to that web server, it will\nbe the information that we want to see.\n\n431\n00:23:22.975 --> 00:23:25.900\nAny other information is\njust going to be discarded.\n\n432\n00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:29.890\nIf we see information that works outside\nof its framework of what we've expected,\n\n433\n00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:33.424\nthe server just discards it, and\nhopefully that will be one of the steps.\n\n434\n00:23:33.424 --> 00:23:35.420\nNow, you always use\na layer of defense system.\n\n435\n00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:39.713\nBut that's one of the steps that can help\nto, not really completely secure you,\n\n436\n00:23:39.713 --> 00:23:42.572\ncuz there's a lot of other\nthings that you have to do.\n\n437\n00:23:42.572 --> 00:23:46.811\nBut that'll be one of the big things\nthat really can lock down that code from\n\n438\n00:23:46.811 --> 00:23:49.178\ngetting inside of your databases there.\n\n439\n00:23:49.178 --> 00:23:52.804\n>> Yeah, input validation is by far one\nof the primary methods that we do use\n\n440\n00:23:52.804 --> 00:23:55.123\nto ensure that when we\nrun web applications and\n\n441\n00:23:55.123 --> 00:23:58.464\nwe are connected to things like databases,\nThat will help us out.\n\n442\n00:23:58.464 --> 00:24:02.748\nAnd if you're sitting there like, okay,\nI think I understood what Wes said, but\n\n443\n00:24:02.748 --> 00:24:06.369\nthe easiest way is to do this when\nyou're also creating those forms.\n\n444\n00:24:06.369 --> 00:24:11.062\nYou can create fields in those forms,\nand then you can set a data type.\n\n445\n00:24:11.062 --> 00:24:12.710\nSo what does that mean?\n\n446\n00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.970\nThat means I won't accept things\nlike coding in that field.\n\n447\n00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:17.860\nSo that's what Wes is talking about.\n\n448\n00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.080\nAnd you can change the data\ntype where if it says look,\n\n449\n00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.500\nthis is a date, then according to the\ndatabase it has to be in that date format.\n\n450\n00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.110\nThis is a string,\nit has to only be a string, or\n\n451\n00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:30.200\nthis is a number value,\nwell you can do that as well.\n\n452\n00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.675\nNow you actually have to be able\nto do that with those forms, and\n\n453\n00:24:32.675 --> 00:24:33.901\nthat will validate the input.\n\n454\n00:24:33.901 --> 00:24:37.533\nAny time somebody then goes to type\nin the date, if it's not correct,\n\n455\n00:24:37.533 --> 00:24:40.736\nit should tell you that it's\nan improperly formatted field or\n\n456\n00:24:40.736 --> 00:24:44.520\ndata that's actually in that field and\nyou need to reformat it.\n\n457\n00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.728\nAnd the reason why is because most of\nthose websites, as you go to them,\n\n458\n00:24:47.728 --> 00:24:48.753\nthey're doing that.\n\n459\n00:24:48.753 --> 00:24:52.950\nIt's letting you know that they're doing\nthat basic input validation as well.\n\n460\n00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:56.871\nOne of the other things that can be done,\nis what we call sanitization, as well, or\n\n461\n00:24:56.871 --> 00:24:57.945\nsanitizing the data.\n\n462\n00:24:57.945 --> 00:25:01.910\nAnd that means, if somebody does\naccidentally, and this can happen.\n\n463\n00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:06.405\nSomebody accidentally puts in some\nstrange unusual characters that end up\n\n464\n00:25:06.405 --> 00:25:09.902\nactually triggering something\ninside of the databases or\n\n465\n00:25:09.902 --> 00:25:14.845\ninside of that operating system, there's\nsomething else that can also happen.\n\n466\n00:25:14.845 --> 00:25:16.703\nWhere what they do is that\nthey escape the character.\n\n467\n00:25:16.703 --> 00:25:20.095\nAnd what they mean is, they take those\ncharacters that may mean something to\n\n468\n00:25:20.095 --> 00:25:24.030\nthe language, and they go look, we're just\ngonna report that as an actual character.\n\n469\n00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:27.242\nWe're not gonna actually make\nit do whatever it does in back.\n\n470\n00:25:27.242 --> 00:25:30.430\nWe're not gonna make it do\nwhatever it does in C language.\n\n471\n00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.380\nWe're actually just gonna say hey,\nit's gonna be a character in itself.\n\n472\n00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:37.930\nSo those are kind of the two basic\nones when you talk about what\n\n473\n00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:41.330\nto do to prevent the idea\nof injections as well.\n\n474\n00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:44.664\nAnd of course the last one is simple,\nI say it's simple,\n\n475\n00:25:44.664 --> 00:25:47.247\nit's something we all should think about.\n\n476\n00:25:47.247 --> 00:25:50.988\nIs that when we develop web applications,\nit shouldn't be the way that a lot of\n\n477\n00:25:50.988 --> 00:25:54.577\npeople develop web applications in\nwhich you go, Ronnie I need a webpage.\n\n478\n00:25:54.577 --> 00:25:57.390\nAnd I go, you wanna know something,\nI bet you I can create that.\n\n479\n00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:58.360\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\n480\n00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.394\nWell, if this is gonna be something for\nyour company,\n\n481\n00:26:00.394 --> 00:26:02.150\ndon't get Bob's brother to do it.\n\n482\n00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:04.930\nAnd then that's what I really,\nI literally mean that.\n\n483\n00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:08.736\nYou need somebody that understands\nboth the coding language for\n\n484\n00:26:08.736 --> 00:26:11.138\ndeveloping on the web and the security.\n\n485\n00:26:11.138 --> 00:26:13.441\nAnd that when they actually\nbuild the webpage,\n\n486\n00:26:13.441 --> 00:26:15.570\nit's actually built integrated in.\n\n487\n00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:19.163\nIt's not like, now I've got the\nfunctionality that Ronnie or Wes wants.\n\n488\n00:26:19.163 --> 00:26:22.639\nNow let's just cover it over\nwith a blanket of security, and\n\n489\n00:26:22.639 --> 00:26:24.625\nI think that that actually works.\n\n490\n00:26:24.625 --> 00:26:28.548\nBecause most of the time people that\nactually attack us they don't really care.\n\n491\n00:26:28.548 --> 00:26:31.424\nThey sit there and they lift up\nthe blanket and go, look at that,\n\n492\n00:26:31.424 --> 00:26:34.753\nI could actually easily slip through\nRonnie's layer of security there.\n\n493\n00:26:34.753 --> 00:26:39.192\nCareful coding is also the third part part\nof the basic types of application security\n\n494\n00:26:39.192 --> 00:26:43.706\nthat we're actually addressing here,\nespecially with the injection attacks too.\n\n495\n00:26:43.706 --> 00:26:44.356\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n496\n00:26:44.356 --> 00:26:48.613\nSo again, just keep in mind that it's got,\nput the checks and balances in there,\n\n497\n00:26:48.613 --> 00:26:52.070\nlayered defense system, and\ndefinitely watch those databases so\n\n498\n00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:56.144\nthat you can keep them secure and make\nsure that the information that you expect\n\n499\n00:26:56.144 --> 00:26:59.505\nto see in these applications is\nthe information that's there.\n\n500\n00:26:59.505 --> 00:27:02.961\n>> All right, well, Wes,\nI think we talked too much on this one,\n\n501\n00:27:02.961 --> 00:27:04.801\non different application text.\n\n502\n00:27:04.801 --> 00:27:05.567\nBut we have more to come.\n\n503\n00:27:05.567 --> 00:27:06.328\n>> Yes.\n>> So that means we're\n\n504\n00:27:06.328 --> 00:27:07.048\ngonna share part two.\n\n505\n00:27:07.048 --> 00:27:08.209\nYou're gonna come back for\nus with part two?\n\n506\n00:27:08.209 --> 00:27:09.021\n>> Absolutely, it's been fun.\n\n507\n00:27:09.021 --> 00:27:10.100\n>> All right.\n\n508\n00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:14.420\nSo thank you for all those diagrams that\nyou helped us with and the explanations.\n\n509\n00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.810\nAnd thank you also for\nwatching our show as well.\n\n510\n00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:19.970\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n511\n00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:21.272\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n512\n00:27:21.272 --> 00:27:23.825\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n513\n00:27:23.825 --> 00:27:30.220\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:20.130\nI'm your host, Ronnie Wong and today\nwe're talking about CompTIA Security+.\n\n4\n00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.270\nOr specifically getting into application\nattacks and this is gonna be a part two of\n\n5\n00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.850\nwhat we've already covered that means\nthat it was so big in that first show,\n\n6\n00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.912\nwe had to extend it to a part two, and who\nbetter to help us out than Mr. Wes Bryan?\n\n7\n00:00:32.912 --> 00:00:36.004\nWho's gonna be our security\nexpert today to help us out.\n\n8\n00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:38.980\nAnd so Wes, we've already talked\nabout a lot of the injection attacks.\n\n9\n00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:39.879\nWhere are we picking up today?\n\n10\n00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.975\n>> Well one of the things that we didn't\nget a chance to finish was one of the last\n\n11\n00:00:43.975 --> 00:00:45.130\ninjection attacks.\n\n12\n00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.977\nSo if you're not familiar with the SQL\ninjection attacks that are on the exam,\n\n13\n00:00:50.977 --> 00:00:52.190\nif you will.\n\n14\n00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.360\nIf you're not familiar with XML and\n\n15\n00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.080\nLDAP injection attacks,\ngo back and watch part one.\n\n16\n00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.938\nThe last one that we really wanna cover\nhere is what is known as directory\n\n17\n00:01:01.938 --> 00:01:03.046\ntraversal attack.\n\n18\n00:01:03.046 --> 00:01:07.488\nNow, one of the things that this is\ngonna do is it's gonna manipulate\n\n19\n00:01:07.488 --> 00:01:10.254\ncommands that we sent into its web server.\n\n20\n00:01:10.254 --> 00:01:13.514\nSo if we look here at my machine,\none of the things that we can do here is\n\n21\n00:01:13.514 --> 00:01:15.850\nwe can send malicious\ndata into the web server.\n\n22\n00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.209\nUnderstand that the web\nservers themselves,\n\n23\n00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:22.212\nthey typically have default directories\non where these websites are stored.\n\n24\n00:01:22.212 --> 00:01:26.158\nWell if you have secured through ACLs,\nAccess Control Lists,\n\n25\n00:01:26.158 --> 00:01:30.775\nyou've made sure that you do have\nauthentication then for the most part,\n\n26\n00:01:30.775 --> 00:01:32.796\nyour web server should be okay.\n\n27\n00:01:32.796 --> 00:01:38.287\nBut what happens when an attacker\nsends a command into that database or\n\n28\n00:01:38.287 --> 00:01:44.629\ninto that server that says, navigate out\nof the home directory for the webpage.\n\n29\n00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:47.770\nAnd let's go ahead and\nnavigate for instance in Windows.\n\n30\n00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.750\nLet's get out of the Inetpub directory.\n\n31\n00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.446\nLet's go down into Windows or\ndown into the system 32 voter, and\n\n32\n00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:55.962\nstart making manipulations to system file.\n\n33\n00:01:55.962 --> 00:02:00.552\nSo that's one of the things with the\ndirectory traversal is the fact that you\n\n34\n00:02:00.552 --> 00:02:04.370\ncan send a command that says,\nback out of this directory.\n\n35\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.087\nWe think of a command prompt, and\nit doesn't matter if you're in Windows.\n\n36\n00:02:07.087 --> 00:02:08.379\nWe think of CD dot dot.\n\n37\n00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:15.370\nCD dot dot brings me back one step in\nthe parent of that folder hierarchy.\n\n38\n00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.680\nWhat's to say that we don't send some kind\nof command like that into the web server\n\n39\n00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.680\nthat says, hey navigate me out of\nthe home directory while the webpage is\n\n40\n00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.880\nbeing stored and navigate me into\nmaybe some system directories there.\n\n41\n00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.860\nAnd from there,\nyour attackers can do manipulations,\n\n42\n00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.880\nmodify systems, data,\nmaybe I crashed the server if you will.\n\n43\n00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.878\nCompletely shut down the server in\na way that it's now corrupted and\n\n44\n00:02:35.878 --> 00:02:37.824\nunfortunately if you don't have backups,\n\n45\n00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:41.046\nyou're gonna be spending some time\nbringing that website back online.\n\n46\n00:02:41.046 --> 00:02:45.630\nSo you have to be careful with\nthe Directory Traversal/Command Injection\n\n47\n00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.122\nattacks because of the fact\nthat it can allow attackers to\n\n48\n00:02:49.122 --> 00:02:53.505\nmove outside of typically the region\nin where the web pages are stored.\n\n49\n00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:57.087\nAnd then from there if it goes unchecked\nfrom there, what else can they do?\n\n50\n00:02:57.087 --> 00:03:00.410\nThey can do all kinds of things,\nincluding crashing your server and\n\n51\n00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.201\nmaybe even corrupting it to the point\nwhere you can't bring it back online and\n\n52\n00:03:04.201 --> 00:03:05.210\nhave to rebuild it.\n\n53\n00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.424\n>> The key here is to remember\nthat what Wes has showed you here,\n\n54\n00:03:08.424 --> 00:03:11.638\nright on the screen is that it's\nnot real difficult to try and\n\n55\n00:03:11.638 --> 00:03:13.672\ncraft a directory traversal attack.\n\n56\n00:03:13.672 --> 00:03:15.256\nIf you can get a connection in and\n\n57\n00:03:15.256 --> 00:03:18.670\nyou can even tell by the URL\nthat you're given there.\n\n58\n00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.160\nWhere the directory and\nthe structure might be.\n\n59\n00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.363\nWell now you know that you might go out\nand just that dot slash dot slash to see\n\n60\n00:03:26.363 --> 00:03:31.337\nif it will also land you in a different\nweb page or a different location.\n\n61\n00:03:31.337 --> 00:03:36.213\nIf it does, it actually let's you know at\nthat point that hey, I can bring you up to\n\n62\n00:03:36.213 --> 00:03:40.970\nthis tree and actually get beyond what\nthe web server says you can get access to.\n\n63\n00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.250\nMost of the time this should not happen\neven with default installations of your\n\n64\n00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.490\nweb servers they normally are going\nto allow only so much access.\n\n65\n00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.790\nBut if for one reason or\nanother you've actually manipulated or\n\n66\n00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.639\nnow permissions have been sent incorrectly\nand now somebody just browsing\n\n67\n00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.750\nthrough a website can actually just enter\nin just a couple of extra characters.\n\n68\n00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.300\nAnd now they can break out of that\nlocation, that's where you have issues.\n\n69\n00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.282\nBecause if they can get\naccess to the root,\n\n70\n00:04:08.282 --> 00:04:11.712\nwell they can actually get access and\ndo a lot more damage than we realize.\n\n71\n00:04:11.712 --> 00:04:15.380\nSo this is where it does become important\nthat we actually do secure ourselves.\n\n72\n00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.046\nAnd we talked about\nthe idea of sanitation.\n\n73\n00:04:17.046 --> 00:04:21.370\nWe talked about the idea of input\nto validation and of course,\n\n74\n00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.712\ncareful coding of our websites.\n\n75\n00:04:23.712 --> 00:04:26.485\nAll this stuff should be\ntested before we ever say hey,\n\n76\n00:04:26.485 --> 00:04:29.600\nwe're gonna put this website\nout there on the public.\n\n77\n00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.462\nSo it's very important that we\nalso do incredible testing.\n\n78\n00:04:32.462 --> 00:04:36.680\nIf we actually are gonna use this for\nanything, such as doing business as well.\n\n79\n00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.230\nBut we're moving beyond\nthe idea of just injection.\n\n80\n00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.830\nWe had to finish that up, but\nwe're actually moving beyond that.\n\n81\n00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.334\nWes, what else are we talking about\nwhen we take a look at the application\n\n82\n00:04:45.334 --> 00:04:46.086\nattacks here.\n\n83\n00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:50.079\n>> The next series of attacks,\nyou might not think of them and\n\n84\n00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:55.962\ntechnically called injection, but it's\nstill the ability to send arbitrary data.\n\n85\n00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:59.657\nArbitrary data into a location\nthat is storing information and\n\n86\n00:04:59.657 --> 00:05:02.583\nseeing if we can get so\nmuch information in there,\n\n87\n00:05:02.583 --> 00:05:06.504\nthat we can start spilling\nthe information into other locations.\n\n88\n00:05:06.504 --> 00:05:09.596\nSo one of the things we wanna talk\nabout is what's known as a buffer\n\n89\n00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:10.504\noverflow attack.\n\n90\n00:05:10.504 --> 00:05:14.700\nIf we look at our computer here, one\nof the things that the attacker does is\n\n91\n00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.421\nthe attacker tries to\nbuffers they store data.\n\n92\n00:05:17.421 --> 00:05:19.736\nIf you think about RAM,\nwe're storing information and\n\n93\n00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:22.691\nthey buffer that information so\nthat it can be stored temporarily while\n\n94\n00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:26.310\nother processors are finished and\nthen that information's called on.\n\n95\n00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.440\nWell, what happens if I can get that\nmalicious code into that buffer,\n\n96\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.128\nand I can fill up the buffer.\n\n97\n00:05:32.128 --> 00:05:35.962\nSo much so that in other program data,\nwhat do we do?\n\n98\n00:05:35.962 --> 00:05:39.374\nWe're overwriting information\neven worse than that,\n\n99\n00:05:39.374 --> 00:05:43.250\nnow the attacker has an active\nlocation and memory.\n\n100\n00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.420\nWell, what's so\nbad about code being in memory?\n\n101\n00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.028\nWell, that's where all code executes\nwhether it's authorized an application or\n\n102\n00:05:49.028 --> 00:05:50.260\nwhether it's malicious.\n\n103\n00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.170\nIt's no different, but\nthe fact of the matter still remains.\n\n104\n00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:58.200\nIf you could send information into that\nbuffer, fill it up, spill some of that\n\n105\n00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.130\ninformation into other locations where\ndata's being stored and being worked with.\n\n106\n00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.379\nWe could overwrite the data,\nwe can crash the applications.\n\n107\n00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:10.950\nWe can crash the entire OS or\neven more than that.\n\n108\n00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.576\nNow that that information, that arbitrary,\nthat malicious code is sitting in a region\n\n109\n00:06:15.576 --> 00:06:19.213\nin memory, now the hacker can\nessentially execute the code as well.\n\n110\n00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:24.596\nSo buffer overflow attacks, when it comes\ndown to it, we're putting malicious\n\n111\n00:06:24.596 --> 00:06:29.837\ndata into a location that has a structured\na area where that data can be stored.\n\n112\n00:06:29.837 --> 00:06:31.296\nThink about it as a cup.\n\n113\n00:06:31.296 --> 00:06:34.796\nYou fill up the cup, you keep filling up\nthe cup, something's gonna spill out.\n\n114\n00:06:34.796 --> 00:06:37.240\nWater's gonna spill out, whatever you're\ndrinking's gonna spill out of the cup.\n\n115\n00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.200\nNow, where does it go?\n\n116\n00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.129\nWell that information is still\nin those unchecked regions.\n\n117\n00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:42.671\nWhat are some of the things that we do?\n\n118\n00:06:42.671 --> 00:06:46.587\nOne of the common things that we do is an\nindustry wide standard called no execute.\n\n119\n00:06:46.587 --> 00:06:48.332\nAnd the different operating systems and\n\n120\n00:06:48.332 --> 00:06:51.260\nvendors they'll implement\nit a little bit different.\n\n121\n00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.879\nIn Windows,\nthey use data execution protection.\n\n122\n00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:57.700\nThat's Microsoft's implementation\nof the no execute.\n\n123\n00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.122\nIt just means if I do have data being\nstored in this location we're gonna mark\n\n124\n00:07:01.122 --> 00:07:02.254\nit as non-executable.\n\n125\n00:07:02.254 --> 00:07:05.921\nNow, that's not the stop gap for\neverything for a buffer overflow attack.\n\n126\n00:07:05.921 --> 00:07:09.809\nCuz keep in mind that we're talking\nabout storing arbitrary code in\n\n127\n00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:12.546\na location that's made\nto store information.\n\n128\n00:07:12.546 --> 00:07:15.657\nSo even at that, you can still\nrun into some problems with but\n\n129\n00:07:15.657 --> 00:07:19.073\nthat is gonna be something that you\nhave to think about when you talk\n\n130\n00:07:19.073 --> 00:07:22.921\nabout a buffer overflow attack is\nthe amount of data that you're sending.\n\n131\n00:07:22.921 --> 00:07:25.540\nSometimes these can cause\ndenial of service attacks.\n\n132\n00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.323\nThey can be simplistic.\nIt's the fact that it\n\n133\n00:07:27.323 --> 00:07:28.840\nshuts down the system.\n\n134\n00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.295\nIt doesn't allow the system to\nrespond to authenticated users.\n\n135\n00:07:32.295 --> 00:07:35.962\nSo these attacks in and of themselves,\ncan also be very damaging.\n\n136\n00:07:35.962 --> 00:07:39.049\nAnd they can allow the hacker\nto go even further than that and\n\n137\n00:07:39.049 --> 00:07:43.620\nstart to do further exploitation on the\nsystem if they can can execute the code.\n\n138\n00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.190\n>> Yeah, this is where that careful\ncoding really does come into play here.\n\n139\n00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:51.029\nThe very fact is buffer overflow\nattacks can be set up so\n\n140\n00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:55.460\nthat what ends up happening is\nyou don't overflow the buffer.\n\n141\n00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.400\nIn other words, it just stops\nthe actual attack from going on.\n\n142\n00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.424\nBut it's not done if you're actually in a\nrush to push that website out of there to\n\n143\n00:08:02.424 --> 00:08:04.451\nmake sure that everything's working.\n\n144\n00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:07.395\nBut now to make sure it's working the way\nthat it needs to along with the extra\n\n145\n00:08:07.395 --> 00:08:08.500\nsecurity that we need.\n\n146\n00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.760\nAnd so this is a fairly simple\nfix that can actually happen.\n\n147\n00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.900\nIf you're paying attention but\nif you're not and\n\n148\n00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.980\nyou're just in a rush that's\nwhere we run into issues as well.\n\n149\n00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:17.505\nNow Wes,\n\n150\n00:08:17.505 --> 00:08:21.659\nwe also have to take a look at the idea\nof what we call integer overflows too.\n\n151\n00:08:21.659 --> 00:08:23.180\nSo Wes help us out with this.\n\n152\n00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.918\n>> Yeah, when we look at an integer\nyou can see the mathematical\n\n153\n00:08:26.918 --> 00:08:28.617\ndefinition of an integer.\n\n154\n00:08:28.617 --> 00:08:30.242\nBut I want you to think\nabout it generically.\n\n155\n00:08:30.242 --> 00:08:34.710\nAn integer is nothing more than a place\nwithin memory to store information.\n\n156\n00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.242\nAnd we have expected\nlengths of these integers.\n\n157\n00:08:37.242 --> 00:08:39.294\nLet's say, for our demonstrations and\n\n158\n00:08:39.294 --> 00:08:42.867\nconversation purposes here we're\ntalking about a 32 bit integer.\n\n159\n00:08:42.867 --> 00:08:44.866\nIf we look at our machine right here.\n\n160\n00:08:44.866 --> 00:08:50.680\nOne of the things that you can see is that\nmaybe an integer is expecting 32 bits.\n\n161\n00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.570\nWell what does the attacker do?\n\n162\n00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.240\nThe attacker sends more information,\nmore bits,\n\n163\n00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.530\nthat's being expected to store\nin that region of memory.\n\n164\n00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.922\nNow you might say, well wait a second Wes,\nwhat's different than this and\n\n165\n00:09:03.922 --> 00:09:05.117\na buffer overflow?\n\n166\n00:09:05.117 --> 00:09:06.076\nWell not really much different.\n\n167\n00:09:06.076 --> 00:09:10.172\nYou can do the same thing if you've got\narbitrary code in an unchecked region of\n\n168\n00:09:10.172 --> 00:09:12.841\nmemory, regardless of\nwhere it's being stored it\n\n169\n00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:16.510\ncan also lead into things\nlike buffer overflow attacks.\n\n170\n00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.374\nRemote code execution,\n\n171\n00:09:18.374 --> 00:09:24.242\nwe talked about that in part one the very\nfirst of this episode here if you will.\n\n172\n00:09:24.242 --> 00:09:25.310\nNow what does that do?\n\n173\n00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:30.410\nIt leads to all sorts of things crashing,\njust like buffer over flows do.\n\n174\n00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:35.018\nCrashing the system, maybe crashing\nan application, rebooting the server,\n\n175\n00:09:35.018 --> 00:09:39.414\nif you will, which I guess that would run\nhand in hand if you crash the OS, and\n\n176\n00:09:39.414 --> 00:09:42.327\nthen things like being\nable to execute that data.\n\n177\n00:09:42.327 --> 00:09:45.035\nSo just think of that as an integer\noverflow attack it's not\n\n178\n00:09:45.035 --> 00:09:47.582\nreally much different than\nan buffer overflow attack,\n\n179\n00:09:47.582 --> 00:09:51.520\nit's I've got an expected length of\ninformation that I'm gonna be receiving.\n\n180\n00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.631\nAnd when I receive that data,\nit's more information,\n\n181\n00:09:54.631 --> 00:09:59.395\nmaybe it's 48 bits instead of 32 bits or\nif it's a 64 bit which is common today,\n\n182\n00:09:59.395 --> 00:10:01.992\nmaybe you have 68 bits or\nyou have 80 bits.\n\n183\n00:10:01.992 --> 00:10:03.159\nWell, what's that extra information?\n\n184\n00:10:03.159 --> 00:10:04.617\nWhere's it gonna get stored?\n\n185\n00:10:04.617 --> 00:10:06.240\nInto those unchecked regions of memory.\n\n186\n00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:12.383\nInto those unchecked integers and now,\njust like the buffer overflow attack,\n\n187\n00:10:12.383 --> 00:10:17.617\nwe have the ability to execute that\ndata or just cause disruptions.\n\n188\n00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:21.253\n>> With integer overflows you can also\nhave that mathematical side of this\n\n189\n00:10:21.253 --> 00:10:22.110\nattack as well.\n\n190\n00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.710\nAnd the reason we need to emphasize that\nas well is that even though integer and\n\n191\n00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:30.060\nthe buffer overflow can go hand and hand,\nthere are people that also take advantage\n\n192\n00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.890\nof the mathematic way\nthat we're talking about.\n\n193\n00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.451\nSo Wes gave us a good example\nwith the idea of 32 bits.\n\n194\n00:10:35.451 --> 00:10:40.190\nNow, if you actually were to take\na look at that, that 32 bits of data.\n\n195\n00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:44.451\nYou actually have about 4 billion or\nso bits.\n\n196\n00:10:44.451 --> 00:10:47.410\n4.2 billion or 4.3 billion bits.\n\n197\n00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.580\nWell, what happens if you go from well,\n32 bits and\n\n198\n00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:51.280\nyou actually send one extra bit in there?\n\n199\n00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.909\nWell, if you only have\n32 bits to work with.\n\n200\n00:10:56.909 --> 00:10:59.825\nWell, what normally happens is\nwhat we call an integer overflow.\n\n201\n00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:01.960\nIt automatically resets itself and\n\n202\n00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.260\nwhat you can end up with is\nsomething a little bit unusual here.\n\n203\n00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.230\nSo let me kinda give you an example\nof what I'm talking about with\n\n204\n00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.060\nan integer flow.\n\n205\n00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:14.476\nI can create a line of code that says,\n0 minus 1 equals,\n\n206\n00:11:14.476 --> 00:11:18.993\nwell you and I would say negative\n1 as what it would equal.\n\n207\n00:11:18.993 --> 00:11:23.534\nBut the problem is if that buffer\nhas actually now flowed over.\n\n208\n00:11:23.534 --> 00:11:27.690\nSo we're actually, let's say at about 4\nbillion bits, and we add in one more.\n\n209\n00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:32.966\nWell, what can happen is that it overflows\nand instead of actually showing us that\n\n210\n00:11:32.966 --> 00:11:38.784\nhey, here it is that should be 4.3 billion\nplus 1, it actually goes back to number 1.\n\n211\n00:11:38.784 --> 00:11:43.930\nAnd that's because it rounds itself again\nstarting back over wrapping itself around.\n\n212\n00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.951\nSo you ever think about\nthe idea of an odometer.\n\n213\n00:11:45.951 --> 00:11:50.030\nNow I had a 1986 Oldsmobile is what I had.\n\n214\n00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:54.575\nAnd in that day, the actual\nodometer was only the 10,000 range.\n\n215\n00:11:54.575 --> 00:12:00.076\nSo I could go up to 99,999, but\nonce it hit that nine-tenths of a mile.\n\n216\n00:12:00.076 --> 00:12:04.674\nAnd it flipped over it actually said that\nmy car equaled to well zero all the way\n\n217\n00:12:04.674 --> 00:12:08.870\nacross or one and you might go well\nwhy the heck does that matter?\n\n218\n00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.400\nWell think about it in this sense.\n\n219\n00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.664\nLet's say that we have bank accounts\nthat's storing information and\n\n220\n00:12:14.664 --> 00:12:19.659\nI know that I'm not practiced enough to\nuse some type of integer overflow in that.\n\n221\n00:12:19.659 --> 00:12:23.800\nThat what I do instead is I don't add\nin a one or I don't add in a zero.\n\n222\n00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.867\nI had in a minus sign instead.\n\n223\n00:12:25.867 --> 00:12:30.101\nSo every time that you go and\nyou purchase something on my website,\n\n224\n00:12:30.101 --> 00:12:33.742\nit adds it all up, but\nit reports it with a minus instead.\n\n225\n00:12:33.742 --> 00:12:37.156\nAnd that means I owe you cash\nuntil you pay me cash or\n\n226\n00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:40.160\nit actually does the same thing here.\n\n227\n00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.720\nWell, what I do is I sit there and go,\n\n228\n00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.640\nevery time you make a transaction, I put a\nsubtraction somewhere inside that code and\n\n229\n00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.560\nwhat ends up happening is,\nI end up charging you 5 or 6 cents more.\n\n230\n00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.640\nAnd that's where we have to worry\nabout things like integer overflows.\n\n231\n00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.540\nSo it's very important again that we\nhave careful coding that may instead\n\n232\n00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.580\nturn values into what we call absolute\nvalues, instead of actually doing plus or\n\n233\n00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.440\nminuses and especially when we get into\nthings like overflow attacks as well.\n\n234\n00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.080\nAnd then when you do the testing, and\nyou do find out that the 4 billion plus 1\n\n235\n00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.784\nactually doesn't equal the 4 billion\nplus 1, it actually equals 1 again.\n\n236\n00:13:12.784 --> 00:13:14.290\nThen that means you have to go back in,\nand\n\n237\n00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:16.240\nfigure out why the math is\nnot doing what you need to.\n\n238\n00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.374\nSo very important that we understand why\nthese contents are that important, and\n\n239\n00:13:20.374 --> 00:13:22.576\nwhy these attacks are happening that way.\n\n240\n00:13:22.576 --> 00:13:23.910\nWhat else are we looking at Wes?\n\n241\n00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.200\n>> Well, a couple of things\nthat we need to talk about.\n\n242\n00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.951\nOne is something you already zero day.\n\n243\n00:13:27.951 --> 00:13:33.349\nWhat zero day exploits is this is when\nthe system's at pretty much its most and\n\n244\n00:13:33.349 --> 00:13:35.190\nhighest vulnerability.\n\n245\n00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.951\nYou say why?\n\n246\n00:13:36.951 --> 00:13:40.784\nWell zero day exploits are ones\nthat haven't been identified yet.\n\n247\n00:13:40.784 --> 00:13:46.117\nThey call them zero day because this\nis the first time it's been discovered.\n\n248\n00:13:46.117 --> 00:13:48.800\nIf it's a security company,\ntypically what do they do?\n\n249\n00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.694\nWell they're putting the white hat on and\nthey're letting everybody know that hey,\n\n250\n00:13:52.694 --> 00:13:55.777\nwe found a vulnerability in this system or\nthis software or a bug here\n\n251\n00:13:55.777 --> 00:13:59.534\nthat's causing some kind of security\nvulnerability and they let the world know.\n\n252\n00:13:59.534 --> 00:14:03.174\nThey let everybody know so that\nthe vendors can release security patches,\n\n253\n00:14:03.174 --> 00:14:04.370\nhot fixes if you will.\n\n254\n00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:08.159\nFix these systems and\nclose that vulnerability off.\n\n255\n00:14:08.159 --> 00:14:09.190\nBut what if I don't have the white hat on?\n\n256\n00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.534\nWhat if I have the black hat on?\n\n257\n00:14:11.534 --> 00:14:13.241\nNow I wanna do this for gain or\n\n258\n00:14:13.241 --> 00:14:16.951\nmaybe I have somewhere in between,\nI've got the gray hat on.\n\n259\n00:14:16.951 --> 00:14:19.960\nI say well, I might tell you what it is,\nhow much you gonna pay me?\n\n260\n00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.492\nWell now the problem is if nobody else\nknows about this and I'm a hacker.\n\n261\n00:14:23.492 --> 00:14:27.465\nAnd again, my intent is to cause some\nkind of malicious activity well,\n\n262\n00:14:27.465 --> 00:14:29.860\nthen no one else is gonna\nbe able to stop me.\n\n263\n00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.367\nAnd that's one of the things\nthat the zero date exploits do.\n\n264\n00:14:32.367 --> 00:14:35.878\nThat's when the system is at\nit's highest vulnerable state,\n\n265\n00:14:35.878 --> 00:14:38.409\nbecause of he fact that\nnobody is aware of it.\n\n266\n00:14:38.409 --> 00:14:41.407\nOne of the other type of\nexploits that you have, and\n\n267\n00:14:41.407 --> 00:14:44.076\nin email systems we\ntalk about attachments.\n\n268\n00:14:44.076 --> 00:14:47.478\nAttachment if you think about it,\nwhen I deliver an email into or\n\n269\n00:14:47.478 --> 00:14:50.628\nthe server I should say,\ndelivers an email to an endpoint,\n\n270\n00:14:50.628 --> 00:14:52.780\na user that's collecting their email.\n\n271\n00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:57.525\nWhat's to say that the attachment isn't\nsome kind of executable string, isn't\n\n272\n00:14:57.525 --> 00:15:02.063\nsome kind of VB script, in Windows if\nyou're using the Visual Basic hosting or\n\n273\n00:15:02.063 --> 00:15:04.075\nthe script hosting, if you will.\n\n274\n00:15:04.075 --> 00:15:06.201\nScripting codes,\nI'll get it right eventually here.\n\n275\n00:15:06.201 --> 00:15:10.231\nSo when that email comes into your system,\nif you don't have checks and\n\n276\n00:15:10.231 --> 00:15:13.187\nbalances, if you don't\nhave antivirus software,\n\n277\n00:15:13.187 --> 00:15:18.610\nyou don't have some kind of antivirus\nrunning concentrated on your email server.\n\n278\n00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.420\nWell problem is,\nthe attachment gets onto the computer,\n\n279\n00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:25.240\nthe person opens it up,\nexecutes and now we have a problem.\n\n280\n00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.950\nSo the attachments are something\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n281\n00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:29.495\nWhen it comes to the attachments,\n\n282\n00:15:29.495 --> 00:15:32.117\nit's one of the reasons you\ndon't open things like spam.\n\n283\n00:15:32.117 --> 00:15:34.808\nYou don't open emails\nthat have attachments and\n\n284\n00:15:34.808 --> 00:15:36.784\nyou don't know who they came from.\n\n285\n00:15:36.784 --> 00:15:39.835\nIt's one thing to say,\nhey I was working with Sally yesterday,\n\n286\n00:15:39.835 --> 00:15:41.370\nshe is our marketing director.\n\n287\n00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.480\nShe's sending me marketing statements.\n\n288\n00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.319\nThey're attached to that email.\n\n289\n00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:46.700\nI'm fairly sure I can trust it.\n\n290\n00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.347\nWe still wanna run our antivirus software\nanyways, but if I receive something maybe\n\n291\n00:15:50.347 --> 00:15:52.811\nfrom somebody in a third party\nin a third world country and\n\n292\n00:15:52.811 --> 00:15:54.520\nhalf the subject line's misspelled.\n\n293\n00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.031\nAnd it's got an attachment.\n\n294\n00:15:57.031 --> 00:15:59.637\nProbably be one that I\nwanna delete right away.\n\n295\n00:15:59.637 --> 00:16:03.361\nSo keep in mind that these attachments are\nalso some things we have to worry about\n\n296\n00:16:03.361 --> 00:16:04.130\nthere Ronny.\n\n297\n00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:09.750\n>> Yeah attachments are kinda the unusual\nway right that people can have viruses or\n\n298\n00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:13.590\nwhatever it is on their systems and\nthat is because everybody's trusting.\n\n299\n00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:14.360\nAnd the very fact is,\n\n300\n00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.430\nwe do need to be a little bit less\ntrusting when it comes down to emails.\n\n301\n00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.360\nAnd the reason why people are so\n\n302\n00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.240\ntrusting is that they don't think\nthat email can harm their system,\n\n303\n00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.280\nbecause they don't know the actual full\npotential damage that something can bring.\n\n304\n00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.580\nSo even though we understand the idea,\nsince we're working toward our security\n\n305\n00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:35.340\nplus about things like fishing scams and\nwe understand that there are malicious\n\n306\n00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:39.170\ncode that comes in on these trojan horses\nthat can actually get on to your systems\n\n307\n00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.940\nand find information and deliver it\nback to people, most people don't.\n\n308\n00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.060\nSo what they actually see is\na little innocent attachment and\n\n309\n00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.170\nwhen they actually click on it,\nthey don't realize it runs code.\n\n310\n00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:50.820\nSo, to prevent this, right?\n\n311\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.610\nIt is something as simple as telling\npeople that if you don't know the user,\n\n312\n00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:59.260\ndo not ever open an attachment, but\neven if you do know the user, right?\n\n313\n00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.580\nAnd, you're not expecting an attachment,\ndon't open it as well.\n\n314\n00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:07.140\nSo, if it actually just takes you\na moment to actually even telephone them.\n\n315\n00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.400\nGo, look, did you just send me\nan email with an attachment?\n\n316\n00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.240\nAnd, they go.\n\n317\n00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.350\nNo, I didn't.\n\n318\n00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:14.419\nWell, that's actually something\nfairly easy that, now you go, okay,\n\n319\n00:17:14.419 --> 00:17:16.880\nwell thank you I just need\nto delete that email.\n\n320\n00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.107\nWhy send me this email and\nnow there is a huge attachment,\n\n321\n00:17:20.107 --> 00:17:21.800\nI wonder what that's about.\n\n322\n00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:22.890\nJust click on it and let it run.\n\n323\n00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:27.490\nSo we do need to be a little bit\nmore careful in the way that we\n\n324\n00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:30.470\nactually tell users that they have\nto handle this type of stuff.\n\n325\n00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.404\nIt'd be nice if all of our\nemail antivirus scans and\n\n326\n00:17:33.404 --> 00:17:36.475\neverything else was able to\ntake this stuff away, but\n\n327\n00:17:36.475 --> 00:17:40.659\nsome of it will still get through and\nthat's where the problem comes in.\n\n328\n00:17:40.659 --> 00:17:46.189\nSo training is pretty much the biggest and\nthe easiest way that we are actually\n\n329\n00:17:46.189 --> 00:17:51.210\ngoing to be able to get rid of this\nidea of attacks from applications.\n\n330\n00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.910\n>> That's right,\nI mean it starts with what,\n\n331\n00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:56.100\nyou know, we say three big things right,\nwhat is it?\n\n332\n00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.600\nPolicies, Procedures and Awareness.\n\n333\n00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.190\nI mean, if you're not aware of\nthese things then they kind of\n\n334\n00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:01.200\nslip under the radar.\n\n335\n00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.310\nAll pun intended and\n\n336\n00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:07.860\nunfortunately now you've got some problems\nthat you've got to remedy in your systems.\n\n337\n00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:11.480\nSo the other types of attacks that we have\nthat we have to worry about are cookies.\n\n338\n00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.868\nAll right, you say cookies,\nwell I love cookies now.\n\n339\n00:18:13.868 --> 00:18:19.092\nIt's interesting that they give this term\ncookies, such a name that we think with,\n\n340\n00:18:19.092 --> 00:18:22.620\nit brings back that nostalgia\nfrom when you were younger.\n\n341\n00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.640\nMaybe you'd come home after school and\nyou'd get cookies.\n\n342\n00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.530\nSo they can't be that bad, right?\n\n343\n00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:28.140\nWe give them a nice friendly name.\n\n344\n00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.210\nWell if we take a look here, one of\nthe things I want you to think about.\n\n345\n00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:34.774\nWe're going to talk about some\nflash cookies here in a second but\n\n346\n00:18:34.774 --> 00:18:37.826\nI want to go ahead and\nload these together.\n\n347\n00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:39.284\nA cookie.\nWhat's it for?\n\n348\n00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:43.427\nWell it's presented as a way to\nmake your browsing experience,\n\n349\n00:18:43.427 --> 00:18:48.577\nyour web viewing experience a little bit\neasier, a little more user friendly.\n\n350\n00:18:48.577 --> 00:18:49.284\nWell, why is that?\n\n351\n00:18:49.284 --> 00:18:52.576\nWell, HTML is very forgetful protocol,\nright?\n\n352\n00:18:52.576 --> 00:18:54.909\nI can connect to a web server and\nif we're not using cookies.\n\n353\n00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:56.535\nI've just been there for four hours.\n\n354\n00:18:56.535 --> 00:19:00.446\nI disconnect from that web server and\nI connect back to it, the server says hi,\n\n355\n00:19:00.446 --> 00:19:01.850\nwho are you?\n\n356\n00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:05.010\nWell the cookies are a way that it can\nretain some of that information so\n\n357\n00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.500\nthat when you reconnect\nback to that web browser or\n\n358\n00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.350\nthrough the web browser back to that\nwebsite, it says, okay, well, I see.\n\n359\n00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.560\nYou were just here before.\n\n360\n00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.380\nYou're West and\nthis was what you were doing at the time.\n\n361\n00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.930\nWell, think about it.\n\n362\n00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:19.080\nThat information is stored and it can\ncontain potential private information.\n\n363\n00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.340\nRight?\nPII, personal identifiable information.\n\n364\n00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:25.410\nAnd If a end user can exploit\n\n365\n00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.530\nthat information then there's a lot of\ndifferent things they can do with it.\n\n366\n00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.490\nNow that's a little bit different\nthen what we talk about when we say\n\n367\n00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.980\nlocally stored objects, or\notherwise known as flash cookies.\n\n368\n00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:40.367\nSee the problem with flash cookies locally\nstored objects is they are a different\n\n369\n00:19:40.367 --> 00:19:41.991\nclass of cookie altogether.\n\n370\n00:19:41.991 --> 00:19:44.366\nThey're not seen by the web browsers.\n\n371\n00:19:44.366 --> 00:19:48.003\nSo, you say, well Wes, I do due diligence,\nyou know I've made sure that I delete my\n\n372\n00:19:48.003 --> 00:19:50.270\nbrowsing history every time\nI shut my browser down.\n\n373\n00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.340\nIn fact, it's set to remove my passwords,\n\n374\n00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.230\nit's set to remove any forms I've filled\nout, clear all that information out.\n\n375\n00:19:55.230 --> 00:20:00.610\nWell that's okay for your web cookies,\ndoes nothing for your flash cookies.\n\n376\n00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:05.656\nFlash cookies are stored on your local\nmachine and they are completely undetected\n\n377\n00:20:05.656 --> 00:20:10.493\nby web browsers, because they're not\nused in the same context, if you will.\n\n378\n00:20:10.493 --> 00:20:12.742\nSo you can't delete them\nby your web browser.\n\n379\n00:20:12.742 --> 00:20:17.180\nSo your average web cookie stores\nabout four kilobytes of data.\n\n380\n00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.580\nNot so with a flash cookie.\n\n381\n00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.530\nYou could be almost up to 100\nkilobytes of data or even more.\n\n382\n00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:26.220\nRight.\nSo, as far as storing information.\n\n383\n00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.060\nThey're gonna store a lot of it.\n\n384\n00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.450\nYou can't delete them\nthrough the web browser.\n\n385\n00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:33.670\nOne of the things that sometimes that\nare even harder to delete when you\n\n386\n00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:37.300\ntell an application, delete that cookie.\n\n387\n00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.464\nEven more so, some of the other common\nthings that they can do with those\n\n388\n00:20:40.464 --> 00:20:43.793\nlocally stored objects is it's\ncollecting your personal information and\n\n389\n00:20:43.793 --> 00:20:46.970\nit sends an outbound to a server\nthat's waiting on, right?\n\n390\n00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:48.960\nGive anonymous usage statistics\nto such and such company.\n\n391\n00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.700\nAre you sure,\nare you sure you want to do that?\n\n392\n00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.768\nSo, you've got to be careful with these,\n\n393\n00:20:53.768 --> 00:20:56.534\nbecause they tend to cause\na little bit more of a problem.\n\n394\n00:20:56.534 --> 00:21:00.285\nSo, one of the things I want you\nto think about with cookies.\n\n395\n00:21:00.285 --> 00:21:06.370\nAlright, I don't want you to think of\nthem as being yummy and nice to eat.\n\n396\n00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:07.020\nRight?\n\n397\n00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.200\nI want you to change your mindset.\n\n398\n00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.330\nWhen you look at these locally stored\nobjects what I want you to think of\n\n399\n00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.010\nthem is quite the opposite.\n\n400\n00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:16.460\nI want you to think of them as\nsomebody spying on your information.\n\n401\n00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.327\nAgain give it a user friendly name.\n\n402\n00:21:19.327 --> 00:21:21.352\nSomething we can all identify and\nyou can look at me and\n\n403\n00:21:21.352 --> 00:21:22.480\nsay I do identify as cookies.\n\n404\n00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.720\nThink of it as something different.\n\n405\n00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.270\nThink of it as somebody that's\nspying on your information and\n\n406\n00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:31.870\nthen once they have that information\nit's up to them what they do with it.\n\n407\n00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.784\nIt doesn't even have to be part of\na privacy policy because they may not even\n\n408\n00:21:34.784 --> 00:21:35.534\nknow it's there.\n\n409\n00:21:35.534 --> 00:21:36.576\nSo you have to be careful.\n\n410\n00:21:36.576 --> 00:21:40.310\nDoesn't matter if it's a web cookie.\n\n411\n00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.780\nIn the context of web browsing, if it's\na locally stored object, a flash cookie,\n\n412\n00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:47.700\nit stores more information and\nit could potentially do the same, right.\n\n413\n00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.490\n>> When we take a look at cookies as well,\ndon't forget that there are legitimate\n\n414\n00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:55.690\npurposes for the use of these cookies, and\nthis something, we have to think about.\n\n415\n00:21:55.690 --> 00:22:00.240\nFor example, if you go to the IT Pro TV\nwebsite, we actually use cookies, and\n\n416\n00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.300\nit's not because we're trying to get\npersonally identifiable information from\n\n417\n00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.940\nyou, but it helps as you actually\nbrowse from one page to the other.\n\n418\n00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:10.630\nIf you go and click on a link and\nit takes you to a different webpage,\n\n419\n00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:14.110\nwell that webpage is not asking for\nauthentication again.\n\n420\n00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.210\nThe reason why is because\n\n421\n00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.430\nit checks the cookie that stored\nin your browser at that point.\n\n422\n00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:18.560\nCuz hey, you've already were here.\n\n423\n00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.310\nAnd then when you actually go\nfrom that page and go again,\n\n424\n00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.660\nit checks that cookie again and it's\njust what we call like a session cookie.\n\n425\n00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:25.800\nRight?\nTo make sure\n\n426\n00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.600\nthat you are actually the same\nperson that actually logged in.\n\n427\n00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.723\nNow if you're not right, then hopefully\nthey'll ask you to get their own cookie,\n\n428\n00:22:31.723 --> 00:22:33.201\nand they'll be able to do that as well.\n\n429\n00:22:33.201 --> 00:22:37.101\nSo there are legitimate uses for\nthem, but the problem is,\n\n430\n00:22:37.101 --> 00:22:39.910\nit is so widely spread and\nis used so often.\n\n431\n00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.990\nNow what ends up happening is somebody has\nfigured out how to take advantage of them.\n\n432\n00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:46.930\nSo when they ask you to do stuff\nlike that, we do end up with things,\n\n433\n00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.050\nyou know,\nin which they can store some information.\n\n434\n00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:52.570\nAnd then people of course\ncan get access to them and\n\n435\n00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:55.850\ntake advantage of\nthe information they get.\n\n436\n00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:58.700\nAnd if you do have now these cookies\nas David has mentioned the idea\n\n437\n00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.360\nof super cookies that are out there,\n\n438\n00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.270\nthey have active code they would have\ncome back and can bring more stuff in.\n\n439\n00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:04.910\nIt's amazing.\n\n440\n00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:06.850\nJust like the idea of flash cookies.\n\n441\n00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.040\n>> Yeah, those super cookies, too.\n\n442\n00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.854\nBecause it doesn't matter if\nyou're saying, do not track,\n\n443\n00:23:10.854 --> 00:23:13.667\nI believe they've gotta,\nin most of browsers, I would do not\n\n444\n00:23:13.667 --> 00:23:17.533\ntrack options the fact that those cookies\nremain behind and you cannot delete them.\n\n445\n00:23:17.533 --> 00:23:19.659\nHence the term super-cookie,\nthey're bulletproof.\n\n446\n00:23:19.659 --> 00:23:23.435\n>> Yeah.\n>> So you definitely have to worry those.\n\n447\n00:23:23.435 --> 00:23:26.175\nNow one of the other things\nwe might have inside\n\n448\n00:23:26.175 --> 00:23:29.575\nof a web browser is the ability to add\nfunctionality to the web browser, right?\n\n449\n00:23:29.575 --> 00:23:31.245\nWe have things like ActiveX out there.\n\n450\n00:23:31.245 --> 00:23:32.525\nWe have things like Java right?\n\n451\n00:23:32.525 --> 00:23:36.555\nSilverlight, and I'm not saying\nthat these technologies are bad and\n\n452\n00:23:36.555 --> 00:23:37.590\nyou have to worry about them.\n\n453\n00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.240\nBut what do they do?\n\n454\n00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.764\nThey add on functionality to\nyour browsing experience,\n\n455\n00:23:41.764 --> 00:23:43.560\nthey enhance the browsing experience.\n\n456\n00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:48.076\nAnd as operating systems, they're not\nimpenetrable, but as operating systems get\n\n457\n00:23:48.076 --> 00:23:52.170\na little bit more secure, well what\nare the hackers and attackers have to do.\n\n458\n00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:54.223\nWell, they gotta attack the applications,\n\n459\n00:23:54.223 --> 00:23:57.471\njust like we're talking about that\nrun on top of the operating system.\n\n460\n00:23:57.471 --> 00:24:01.150\nAnd this is where things, the concept\nis known malicious add on, right?\n\n461\n00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:04.665\nIf we know that there's a commonality\nacross all web browsers\n\n462\n00:24:04.665 --> 00:24:08.519\nthat you're gonna add this language\nto increase the functionality\n\n463\n00:24:08.519 --> 00:24:10.830\nof the web browser to make it easy to use.\n\n464\n00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:14.294\nRemember we talk about security\nease of use reduces security.\n\n465\n00:24:14.294 --> 00:24:16.547\nWell, it's not gonna be\nany different here, right?\n\n466\n00:24:16.547 --> 00:24:20.090\nWe talk about adding functionality,\nwe can also add malicious.\n\n467\n00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:20.660\nPersonality.\n\n468\n00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.820\nAnd that's why you got to worry\nabout the malicious add on's, right?\n\n469\n00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:27.240\nExploiting the web browser, it's supposed\nto be, just like Ronnie just mentioned,\n\n470\n00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:29.160\nit's supposed to be a good thing, right?\n\n471\n00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.730\nBut, there again, anything that's good,\n\n472\n00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:34.400\nany system administration utility\ncan also be used for attack.\n\n473\n00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.860\nAnything that we use to enhance\nthe browser experience of the end user,\n\n474\n00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:42.160\nand reduce the complexity a lot of\ntimes we increase the attack surface.\n\n475\n00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.350\nAnd malicious add-ons,\nthey're really no different.\n\n476\n00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.940\nIt's gonna be something you have to watch.\n\n477\n00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.760\nThat's why a lot of the web browsers have,\ncase in example here.\n\n478\n00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.370\nInternet Explorer has security zones, and\n\n479\n00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:56.150\nif you have a website that sits\nin the internet security zone,\n\n480\n00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:59.620\nthose addons are going to be\ncontrolled a little more strict.\n\n481\n00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:03.190\nThen, they also have one that's\ncalled the trusted site zone.\n\n482\n00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:04.050\nWell,what's a trusted site?\n\n483\n00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:07.300\nIt means, I can identify the website,\ncould be an internal website,\n\n484\n00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.220\ncould be an external website.\n\n485\n00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:11.700\nBut when I go to it, I'm pretty sure,\nbut we don't know this,\n\n486\n00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.880\nbut we'll just say theory wise I'm pretty\nsure that I can trust that website.\n\n487\n00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.980\nAnd it reduces the security that might\nbe related to some of these add-ons, and\n\n488\n00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.820\nthings that can add that functionality.\n\n489\n00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:24.920\nNow, because of that you can also increase\nthe potential for exploitation on that.\n\n490\n00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.890\nBut you gotta watch\nthose malicious add-ons.\n\n491\n00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:30.330\nWe can increase the user experience\nby decreasing the security.\n\n492\n00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.430\nYeah.\nLet's kind of give an example here of what\n\n493\n00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:33.680\ncan also end up happening.\n\n494\n00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.840\nSo, remember at Microsoft they're\nthe ones that came up with something\n\n495\n00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:37.810\nthat we call Active X.\n\n496\n00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:41.390\nAnd Active X ,it works for\nwhat they really want it to work for.\n\n497\n00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:44.020\nBut it can be taken advantage of as well.\n\n498\n00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:48.130\nActive X can run as an add on into your\nbrowser, and the problem with that is\n\n499\n00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:51.780\nthat even though most modern browsers,\nthey tend to isolate themselves, they put\n\n500\n00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:56.440\nthemselves into a sandbox, the Active X\ncomponent though didn't run in a sandbox.\n\n501\n00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:00.240\nIn other words, it actually had kernel\nlevel access a lot of the times.\n\n502\n00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.440\nAnd that meant it ran independently\nof the browser as well.\n\n503\n00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:07.990\nSo, if somebody could actually figure out\nhow to create ActiveX types of controls,\n\n504\n00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:11.870\nand ActiveX types fo applications,\nwhat could happen is fairly simple.\n\n505\n00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:12.850\nIt's that you go ahead and\n\n506\n00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:17.620\nsay hey, I need the functionality of this\nadd-on, I'm seeing and you download it.\n\n507\n00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.470\nThe problem is,\nif it's a third party add-on.\n\n508\n00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.240\nAnd you don't know, who actually wrote it.\n\n509\n00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.200\nYou don't know, what it did.\n\n510\n00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.270\nThey just promised you,\nthat it's gonna do something.\n\n511\n00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:26.610\nThey could have also\nincluded in their code,\n\n512\n00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:29.080\nsomething that actually\nmanipulates the Active X.\n\n513\n00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.910\nAnd when they do something like that,\n\n514\n00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:34.280\nremember it has access to everything\ninside really of your computer.\n\n515\n00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.500\nBecause it doesn't actually\nstay locked in that control.\n\n516\n00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.790\nSo, that's where you also\nhave to be worry about it.\n\n517\n00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:42.410\nThe good thing is,\nif it was from Microsoft, it was signed.\n\n518\n00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:45.270\nIn other words,\nthey're not gonna do something.\n\n519\n00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:49.190\nSo normally, when we talk about controls,\nfor me it is not digitally signed.\n\n520\n00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:51.270\nAnd do not actually go to install it.\n\n521\n00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:55.700\nThat is gonna be something you just\ndon't want to actually ever encounter.\n\n522\n00:26:55.700 --> 00:27:00.020\nYou know, if you think about downloading\nsomething from the Internet that says\n\n523\n00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:01.330\nlook, I can run using ActiveX,\n\n524\n00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:06.020\nsince ActiveX can actually get control\noutside of the web browser context.\n\n525\n00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:11.400\nWell, that means it runs on your system,\nand it then, can get access really to\n\n526\n00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.920\nthe entire system, something you\ndon't want to have to deal with ever.\n\n527\n00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.480\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n\n528\n00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.100\nRonnie's talking about sandbox.\n\n529\n00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.280\nYou say what do you mean?\n\n530\n00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.130\nWell, Java Java has what's known as\nvirtualize sandbox were it's run it's\n\n531\n00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:27.930\nhopefully, the goal is to run it, isolated\nfrom the rest of other application data.\n\n532\n00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:30.750\nSo, you have to be careful.\n\n533\n00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.130\nOne of the next thing, I wanna talk about\nis you might have heard Ronny when he was\n\n534\n00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.910\ntalking about session, or he was talking\nabout cookies, web cookies, right.\n\n535\n00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:37.530\nWe just mentioned that.\n\n536\n00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.810\nOne of the things he mentioned was\nsomething knowned as a session.\n\n537\n00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:40.940\nSession cookie.\n\n538\n00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:41.580\nWell, what does that mean?\n\n539\n00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:42.710\nWhat's a session cookie?\n\n540\n00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:47.250\nWell, remember if I connect to a website,\nit's gonna say that I have active\n\n541\n00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:51.430\ncommunication session with that server,\nbetween my web browser, and that server.\n\n542\n00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:53.860\nRight?\nWell, what is that session cookie?\n\n543\n00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.060\nWell, it's an identifier,\nit identifies me as being the user that's.\n\n544\n00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.010\nConnected to that website.\n\n545\n00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:59.700\nAnd that's one of the reasons, if I\ndisconnect to the website, and I clear\n\n546\n00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.540\nthat cookie, and then, turn around, and\njust connect right back to it, even if\n\n547\n00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:06.100\nI've been on that website for eight hours,\nit says I have no clue, who you are.\n\n548\n00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.990\nSo, the session cookies can carry\nwhat's known as a session ID.\n\n549\n00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:11.160\nAnd that leads us into our next attack.\n\n550\n00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.130\nAnd that's something known as\nthe session hijacking attack.\n\n551\n00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:15.880\nIf we look at our computer here,\n\n552\n00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.630\nwhen a user connects to a web\nserver they authenticate, right.\n\n553\n00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.840\nAnd then, the web server goes through the\nprocess of checking acls, and looks for\n\n554\n00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.230\nauthorization, and it says,\nhi I recognize you you're Ronnie Wong.\n\n555\n00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:27.030\nYou're on the ITProTV website,\nyou're allowed to be here.\n\n556\n00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:30.070\nWell, what about if somebody decides that\n\n557\n00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:33.990\nthey are going to do some packet sniffing,\nright.\n\n558\n00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:38.750\nSo, our attacker here does some packet\nsniffing, and captures that session id.\n\n559\n00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.500\nWell, now we have a problem.\n\n560\n00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.370\nBecause what the attacker can turn around,\nand\n\n561\n00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:46.330\ndo is take that session identifier and\nthen replay it.\n\n562\n00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:49.400\nSo, kind of another attack\nthat we've talked about before\n\n563\n00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.220\nin security plus is a replay attack,\nright.\n\n564\n00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.950\nNow, that I've got that information,\n\n565\n00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:59.460\nthat is from a legitimate authorize user,\nand I've got that session id.\n\n566\n00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:02.890\nI turn arround, and\nI send it back to the server, and\n\n567\n00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:05.320\nI say, I wanna reset the connection.\n\n568\n00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:09.820\nWell now, I kicked the legitimate user of\nthe session they have already established,\n\n569\n00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:13.710\nand I replay their session id, and\nnow, the web server doesn't know.\n\n570\n00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:17.680\nThat it's hacker come lately,\nand it's not the authorized user.\n\n571\n00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:21.560\nAnd I can do the same kind of request\ndata, the server sends back data.\n\n572\n00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:25.720\nAnd essentially, what I've done is\ncompletely said, you know what?\n\n573\n00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.540\nYou don't exist anymore.\n\n574\n00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.750\nNow, I'm the only one as\nthe attacker that exists, and\n\n575\n00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:33.130\nfrom whatever exploitations we can do\nthere, whether just gathering data.\n\n576\n00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:35.620\nConnecting and then, some other\ntypes of attacks we've talked about.\n\n577\n00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:38.580\nSo, some the session hijacking is one\nyou really got to be careful with.\n\n578\n00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.320\nAnd it's one of the reasons\nthat through good coding,\n\n579\n00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.160\nyou don't want to put too much private\ninformation inside of these cookies, and\n\n580\n00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:47.630\nstoring it because then again, and you got\na package sniffing whether I'm getting\n\n581\n00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:51.650\na session id, or that personal\nidentifiable inform Information is now\n\n582\n00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:55.770\nstored in the attackers computer, and I\ncan use it to further exploit the system.\n\n583\n00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:58.710\n>> Alright, Wes, that's a lot of different\ntypes of attacks that we need to be aware\n\n584\n00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:00.710\nof because there's more and more, right?\n\n585\n00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:02.700\nOur world is getting connected\nto the cloud which means,\n\n586\n00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.550\nwe're gonna have more web interface\nthat we have to deal with.\n\n587\n00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:08.600\nDaily, that means as security\nprofessionals we're also going to have to\n\n588\n00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:12.690\nteach ed users to also understand those\ntoo, a lot of what we've talked about, so\n\n589\n00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.140\nfar in these two episodes together,\n\n590\n00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.780\nright, have really been about\nsecuring that web server.\n\n591\n00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:20.700\nSome of them are on the client side of\nattacks, in other words, something that\n\n592\n00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:25.120\nthe client, the person that's connecting\ncan do something about a lot of it,\n\n593\n00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.020\nhas to do with us being vigilant and\nmaking sure that we understand how it is.\n\n594\n00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.660\nHow these attacks actually are formed and\nwhere we actually do see them as well.\n\n595\n00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:38.250\nWes, any last comments here on application\nattacks that we need to let people know?\n\n596\n00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:42.280\n>> I just wanna reiterate a good statement\nthat you said earlier, alright, and\n\n597\n00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:47.020\nwe were kind of talking about,\npolicies, procedures, and awareness.\n\n598\n00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.900\nYou can't defend against\nany of these attacks,\n\n599\n00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:54.150\nif your end users are first\naware that it exists.\n\n600\n00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:57.130\nThey don't have training,\nto know what you do and don't do, and\n\n601\n00:30:57.130 --> 00:31:00.630\nyou don't have policies and\nprocedures that, the first two.\n\n602\n00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:02.420\nSo, I think that was a great save.\n\n603\n00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:05.100\nAnd, that's one of the things, awareness\nwill lead to a more secure environment.\n\n604\n00:31:06.365 --> 00:31:09.550\n>> Alright, so we took a look at\nthe idea of buffer overflow attacks,\n\n605\n00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.080\nas well as integer attacks.\n\n606\n00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.760\nWe also ended up taking a look at cookies,\nand\n\n607\n00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:16.710\neven flash cookies,\nthat also exist on our computers, and\n\n608\n00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:20.380\nlastly we also talked about the idea\nof what session hijacking to.\n\n609\n00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:24.710\nThere's a lot of information for\nus as we get ready for the exam, and\n\n610\n00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:28.040\nwe're glad that you're also were\nright here watching as well.\n\n611\n00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:31.560\nWes, thank you again for\nhelping us understand these concepts.\n\n612\n00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.890\nSo,, signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n613\n00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:36.360\n>> And I'm Wes Bryan.\n\n614\n00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:43.325\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n615\n00:31:43.325 -->

00:00:08.262\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.262 --> 00:00:12.320\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.241\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode here at ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:17.227\nIT Pro TV.\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.227 --> 00:00:18.730\nIn this compTIA episode,\n\n8\n00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.850\nwe're going to be looking at security\nplus, specifically, application security.\n\n9\n00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.690\nWith us, we have Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.420\nThank you for joining us today, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.750\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for having me back,\n\n12\n00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.280\nas we continue on taking a look\nat some compTIA security plus,\n\n13\n00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.180\nespecially this idea of application\nsecurity controls Now, let me go ahead and\n\n14\n00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.480\nkind of define something before\nwe really get started here.\n\n15\n00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.420\nWe talk about the idea of\napplication security, if security is\n\n16\n00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.040\nnot your background, and even the terms\nthat we use sound a little bit strange.\n\n17\n00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.860\nJust hang on.\n\n18\n00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.140\nJust know a little bit more about it,\nhopefully this will help some\n\n19\n00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.750\nunderstanding that you'll definitely need\nfor the exam, but also in the future.\n\n20\n00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.670\nAnd the first term I just want to make\nsure that we understand here is gonna\n\n21\n00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.802\nbe the term application.\n\n22\n00:01:00.802 --> 00:01:03.127\nAnd the reason why I want\nus to understand that,\n\n23\n00:01:03.127 --> 00:01:07.143\nis because when we normally talk about in\nterms of just a regular computer user, we\n\n24\n00:01:07.143 --> 00:01:11.335\nthink about applications like productivity\napplications like a word processor, or\n\n25\n00:01:11.335 --> 00:01:14.827\na spreadsheet program, or\nsomething like PowerPoint, to help us make\n\n26\n00:01:14.827 --> 00:01:16.805\npresentations is a lot [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n27\n00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:19.405\nRon those used to be called\nprograms when I started in IT.\n\n28\n00:01:19.405 --> 00:01:20.840\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they did.\n\n29\n00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.590\nAnd they still do.\n\n30\n00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.383\nBut today we hear about\nthe term applications.\n\n31\n00:01:25.383 --> 00:01:25.940\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n32\n00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.980\n&gt;&gt; More than anything else too.\n\n33\n00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.910\nBut really what we're normally\nreferring to at this point when we talk\n\n34\n00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.000\nan application is really gonna be the idea\nof a web server the majority of the time,\n\n35\n00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.550\nin terms of applications.\n\n36\n00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.460\nAnd something,\nthat's specifically coded for\n\n37\n00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.360\nwhat you're doing in your business, and\nthat may be used internally as well.\n\n38\n00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.110\nBut most of the time people are referring\nto the Idea of, well really the web server\n\n39\n00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.460\nas well as how browsers connect to it and\nthat's what we're really focusing in on.\n\n40\n00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.010\nAre some of the different controls\nthat we have available to us\n\n41\n00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.800\nto ensure that we can\nunderstand what's going on and\n\n42\n00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.800\nto actually see if we can find\nvulnerabilities that exist as well, okay?\n\n43\n00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.450\nAnd this is very important in this day and\nage and which companies are,\n\n44\n00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.220\nagain, basing their entire business,\nlet's say, well, online.\n\n45\n00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.520\nRight now,\nIT Pro TV is a great example of that.\n\n46\n00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.240\nOur way that we end up getting customers\nis not that we have a brick and\n\n47\n00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.160\nmortar store that people come in and\nbuy products so\n\n48\n00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.010\nmuch but\nwe're what?Our presence is really online.\n\n49\n00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.989\nOur studios are here that's\nwe have to work in, but\n\n50\n00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.730\noverall everything that we do\nis really based on being online.\n\n51\n00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.950\nAnd that means that it's very\nimportant that our application,\n\n52\n00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.870\nour particular website, all the webpages,\nall the links, everything that we have.\n\n53\n00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.150\nIt's coded to the way that we need to.\n\n54\n00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.030\nIt's doing everything that we need\nwithout violating any types of security.\n\n55\n00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.530\nAnd so, that means that before we actually\nstart implementing new things, it has to\n\n56\n00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.335\ngo through a process of a lot of different\nthings, but one of those processes,\n\n57\n00:02:57.335 --> 00:03:02.155\nof course, is understanding the security\ncontrols that we need to make sure\n\n58\n00:03:02.155 --> 00:03:07.515\nthat are in place before we start moving\nthis towards a very productive type\n\n59\n00:03:07.515 --> 00:03:11.875\nof front end for users to be able to\nconnect in and do what we need to.\n\n60\n00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:14.055\nSo that's where we're beginning that idea.\n\n61\n00:03:14.055 --> 00:03:15.635\nSo whenever you hear the term application.\n\n62\n00:03:15.635 --> 00:03:18.510\nWhen we're talking about it, that's\nwhat you're thinking about is take for\n\n63\n00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.720\nan example a custom web site not just\nthe idea of web pages where a user\n\n64\n00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.290\nis actually using it, but the entire\nsite itself and how it functions and\n\n65\n00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.390\nhow it operates how do you get the product\nout of it that you need as a consumer.\n\n66\n00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.320\nAnd how to we ensure that everything is\nactually working the way that we want\n\n67\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.400\nit to, and then how secure\nit's also gonna be as well.\n\n68\n00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.090\nOkay.\n\n69\n00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.170\nSo, one of the first things we need\nto talk about here is of course,\n\n70\n00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.900\nthe idea of discovering\nvulnerabilities that we have and\n\n71\n00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.610\nsome of the controls that are in\nplace to really help us out.\n\n72\n00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've got a warm fuzzy feeling\nthat we're gonna be talking about some\n\n73\n00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.220\nfuzzing right, Ronnie?\n\n74\n00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, one of the key things that\nwe can do is to test our website,\n\n75\n00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.570\nor our application, by using\na particular type of technique here,\n\n76\n00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.180\na control that we call\nthe idea of using fuzzing.\n\n77\n00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.850\nOkay?\n\n78\n00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.730\nNow, if that sounds funny to you, it does\nactually sound funny, fuzzing, fuzzing.\n\n79\n00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.249\n&gt;&gt; It is a funny word, yeah.\n\n80\n00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:14.716\n&gt;&gt; It's kind of a weird word here.\n\n81\n00:04:14.716 --> 00:04:19.230\nBut you might do want to what are you\ntalking about a lot of times when you're\n\n82\n00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.529\nstarting to do this?\n\n83\n00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:25.145\nThe idea behind fuzzing at the most\nbasic way that we can describe it,\n\n84\n00:04:25.145 --> 00:04:30.860\nis that every user that connects to our\nwebsite is gonna input some type of data.\n\n85\n00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:31.470\nOk.\n\n86\n00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.110\nSo, normally let's say that\nyour signing up to ITProTV and\n\n87\n00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.770\nyou know there's a form for\nyou to fill out, and\n\n88\n00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.140\nthose form type fills in them,\nyou simple type in your name.\n\n89\n00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.950\nThat's great, ok.\n\n90\n00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.330\nWhat somebody might do,\nan attacker might do,\n\n91\n00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.330\nis simply instead of typing in a name,\ntype in something else.\n\n92\n00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.990\nType in anything else,\n\n93\n00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.950\nokay, to see what type of response\nthat the website gives you okay.\n\n94\n00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.440\nFuzzing, is pretty much a technique\nthat wants to test whether or\n\n95\n00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.400\nnot they're gonna get a different response\nin what they're normally looking for\n\n96\n00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.340\nwhen you actually start talking\nabout something like this.\n\n97\n00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.440\nNow, what are they normally looking for?\n\n98\n00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.330\nThat's really the key, when we start\ntaking a look at the idea of fuzzing here.\n\n99\n00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.350\nSo remember that that's what\nwe're taking a look at, right?\n\n100\n00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.140\nThey're gonna throw something else in\nthere, maybe a lot of something else in\n\n101\n00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.810\nthere and hopefully evoke a response\nthat is gonna give them some type of\n\n102\n00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.750\nerror message that's going to\nbe unexpected for you and me.\n\n103\n00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.890\nWe don't want to actually\nhave that showing.\n\n104\n00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.890\nBut for whoever the attacker is,\n\n105\n00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.320\nwhoever might be trying to take\nadvantage of this to exploit out there.\n\n106\n00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.790\nThey may actually go I know\nexactly what to do next.\n\n107\n00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.980\nAnd that's where it kind of comes in, so\nwe need to watch out for those things.\n\n108\n00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.100\n&gt;&gt; So, what you're saying Ronnie is, like\na shoe company like Nike, if they were\n\n109\n00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.520\nto go ahead and release a product, they'd\nwanna perform some kind of stress test, so\n\n110\n00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.430\nthey might have a little robot or\nsomething on a treadmill\n\n111\n00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.290\nrunning X amount of miles,\nto see how long those shoes stand up.\n\n112\n00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.870\nAnd so, what you're saying is really,\nthe developers,\n\n113\n00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.930\nthe programmers are gonna wanna\ntest their applications and\n\n114\n00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.530\nfuzz them before releasing\nthem out into the public.\n\n115\n00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.690\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nbecause what you can end up with, right,\n\n116\n00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.080\nis somebody just putting in\nthings into a random form.\n\n117\n00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.240\nThere's couple of big things here,\nor a few I should say just a couple,\n\n118\n00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.920\ncuz that normally means two here.\n\n119\n00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.860\nOne is buffer overflows, okay?\n\n120\n00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.910\nIf they come back and there's an error\nthat actually allows them and\n\n121\n00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.600\nwhat it shows up is on the webpage or\n\n122\n00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.700\nwhatever the response is,\nit shows that a buffer overflows happen,\n\n123\n00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.950\nwell that is something that we\nweren't expecting to actually show up.\n\n124\n00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.290\nSo that's something that tells us,\nhey, the data that was input in here\n\n125\n00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.540\ncaused a response that it\nshouldn't have caused, okay?\n\n126\n00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.760\nThe other one that you might also\nsee of course are SQL errors and\n\n127\n00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.790\nthis actually is even more important.\n\n128\n00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.040\nNow, don't get me wrong but for\n\n129\n00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.200\noverflows are very important because\nof what they allow you to do.\n\n130\n00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.330\nBut SQL errors kind of tell you\nsomething a bit special here, okay?\n\n131\n00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.998\nIt means that whatever you did not\nonly affected the front end, but\n\n132\n00:06:56.998 --> 00:07:00.995\nactually went and connected a database\nsomewhere else on this planet and\n\n133\n00:07:00.995 --> 00:07:05.254\nnow you actually got a response,\ndirectly from that database that told you,\n\n134\n00:07:05.254 --> 00:07:09.645\nhey an error occurred when you entered\nsomething wrong into this field here, so\n\n135\n00:07:09.645 --> 00:07:13.489\nwhat field if I want to compromise\nyour database might actually try?\n\n136\n00:07:13.489 --> 00:07:17.564\nThat one again, and try and see if I can\nget another response that might tell me\n\n137\n00:07:17.564 --> 00:07:20.440\neven more about what's happening, okay?\n\n138\n00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.380\nAlso of course,\nmemory leaks can also show up\n\n139\n00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.530\nIn which you actually find out something,\nthat hey, it's not actually closing down.\n\n140\n00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.720\nAnd now it's starting to crash,\nthe program crash is gonna exist.\n\n141\n00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:37.010\nYou name it, there's other things that you\ncan end up finding out by simply fuzzing.\n\n142\n00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.830\n&gt;&gt; Now that term I've heard before,\na leaky app.\n\n143\n00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.730\nWould that be the same thing\nas far as the retaining or\n\n144\n00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.760\nnot relinquishing that memory?\n\n145\n00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.348\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's exactly what\nyou're looking at, right.\n\n146\n00:07:46.348 --> 00:07:50.831\nAnd so if you have on the back\nend of your website okay.\n\n147\n00:07:50.831 --> 00:07:53.872\nAn application that's running and\nwhen it's not in\n\n148\n00:07:53.872 --> 00:07:58.724\nuse it's still continuing to not only take\nup ram but continuing to eat up more ram.\n\n149\n00:07:58.724 --> 00:08:00.199\nWell, now you have something else.\n\n150\n00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:04.194\nSo it might be where you entered something\ninto a field, in the data input and\n\n151\n00:08:04.194 --> 00:08:06.140\nit cause that app to continue to run.\n\n152\n00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.810\nAnd then, after a while it just cause\nthe entire website to reboot or\n\n153\n00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.230\nto stop working.\n\n154\n00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.090\nYou might find out that you did\nhave a leaky application which\n\n155\n00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.700\nnormally results from poor\ncoding at some point, so\n\n156\n00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.130\nit's really something that\nwe want to understand.\n\n157\n00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.620\nNow, when I say this like, so\nyou just told us what the attack was,\n\n158\n00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.760\nhow does this fit in to control?\n\n159\n00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.090\nWell, that's why you want to do\nthe idea of penetration testing here\n\n160\n00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:34.690\nto be able to find these\nresponses before you go ahead and\n\n161\n00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.050\nyou say,\nlet's push this out to the general public.\n\n162\n00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.530\nSo at this point, it allows you,\n\n163\n00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:44.400\nif you're actually doing this inside\nof a testing environment, first.\n\n164\n00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.290\nDuring the application development to find\nthe vulnerability that we have in place,\n\n165\n00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.400\nto find errors that fall through\nthe cracks when human eyes can't.\n\n166\n00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.310\nWe have multiple developers\nhere on staff at ITProTV and\n\n167\n00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.910\nthey are all excellent at what they do.\n\n168\n00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:59.960\nThey really are, they're top notch people.\n\n169\n00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.660\nBut even then, you're talking\nabout hundreds, if not thousands,\n\n170\n00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.990\nof lines of code.\n\n171\n00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.640\nAnd after a while,\n\n172\n00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:09.760\neven developers eyes can cross when\nstaring at those lines of code.\n\n173\n00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.420\nAnd it doesn't take a lot for\nthem to miss it.\n\n174\n00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:18.170\nBecause errors are actually fairly simple\nthat can cause a lot of unusual results.\n\n175\n00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.910\nSo in that sense,\nwhen you do something like that.\n\n176\n00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.990\nYou have to pay attention here.\n\n177\n00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:27.300\nSo you might actually find that there's\nactually tools available while your doing\n\n178\n00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.512\nthe fuzzing that can help you to scan for\n\n179\n00:09:30.512 --> 00:09:36.130\nthose error that humanize may not\nbe able to actually attack as well.\n\n180\n00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.199\nThe other thing that some of\nthese tools can help you do,\n\n181\n00:09:39.199 --> 00:09:43.720\nespecially if your doing fuzzing, is it\ncan save you a tremendous amount of time.\n\n182\n00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.670\nBecause where an application like\na fuzzing utility that you can use for\n\n183\n00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:53.126\nthis type of penetration testing,\nyou can run multiple times or\n\n184\n00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:56.756\nmultiple instances at one time or\neven try to test for\n\n185\n00:09:56.756 --> 00:10:01.238\nmultiple vulnerabilities across\nmultiple fields at one time.\n\n186\n00:10:01.238 --> 00:10:03.508\nWhere is if you were trying\nto do this one at a time,\n\n187\n00:10:03.508 --> 00:10:07.190\nyou might find out that it takes\nyou a lot longer to do as well.\n\n188\n00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.850\nSo there's many different tests that are\navailable, as well as automated tests that\n\n189\n00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:15.330\nyou can actually run, and so\nat this point here, it really is helpful.\n\n190\n00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.040\nNow, what are some of the drawbacks on\nusing just tools that are available?\n\n191\n00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.670\nEverybody loves the tools\nthat are available and\n\n192\n00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.760\nthat's why they're out there cuz\nif people didn't use the tools and\n\n193\n00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.990\ndidn't have any effect to them\nthey would just put them down.\n\n194\n00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.930\nYou can take the time to go out and\nunderstand how to develop your own\n\n195\n00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:36.950\ncustom fuzzing tool using\nprogramming as well and\n\n196\n00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.735\nthis is where it becomes dangerous\nin just relying on tools.\n\n197\n00:10:40.735 --> 00:10:43.650\nIt's easy enough when you\nrely on the tool to help\n\n198\n00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.920\nyou in a situation what you needed, but\n\n199\n00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.270\nover all we are really doing this to\nhelp test out the controls are in place.\n\n200\n00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:54.710\nYou should also think about\nthe techniques that underlie the tools.\n\n201\n00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.220\nWhy are they looking for this and\nhow do actually get that to work.\n\n202\n00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.420\nYou need to understand that\nparticular compromise too.\n\n203\n00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.370\nAnd the reason behind that is if that tool\nor whatever the application is that you're\n\n204\n00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:08.260\nusing to help this test go along,\nif you don't know it\n\n205\n00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.750\nit means you don't understand what's\nactually happening in the background.\n\n206\n00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.479\nAnd that means that if you get some\nresponse back from whatever tool that you\n\n207\n00:11:15.479 --> 00:11:19.572\nchoose to use and it doesn't seem like\na proper response, well, how do you know.\n\n208\n00:11:19.572 --> 00:11:22.234\nHow do you know what you're actually\nexpecting if you don't understand\n\n209\n00:11:22.234 --> 00:11:23.890\nthe underlying technique?\n\n210\n00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:27.430\nSo you can become very heavily\ndependent upon one tool.\n\n211\n00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.480\nAnd so, instead, the recommendation of\ncourse is not only to use those tools, but\n\n212\n00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:36.070\nalso to understand the basic underlying\ntechnique of some of the fuzzing tools and\n\n213\n00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.380\ntheir capabilities.\n\n214\n00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.540\nAnd figure out how to also run those\neven without the tool if you need to.\n\n215\n00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.520\nYou might go,\nI'll never run it without sign.\n\n216\n00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.980\nBut overall, you need that to at least\nunderstand those techniques behind it.\n\n217\n00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.925\nBecause it's not just that the tool runs,\nit's what is it based off of?\n\n218\n00:11:50.925 --> 00:11:54.170\nWhat's the principle behind that tool\nthat you really want to learn about?\n\n219\n00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.560\n&gt;&gt; From what I understand, Ronnie,\nit seems like a lot of these tools,\n\n220\n00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.810\nthey'll go ahead and\ntake some really common errors, or\n\n221\n00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:04.710\nissues, and test those first so that it\nwill kinda just get them out of the way.\n\n222\n00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.850\nAnd hopefully reduce the overall\ntime that it is spent\n\n223\n00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.610\nduring this fuzzing process, right?\n\n224\n00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:11.270\n&gt;&gt; It really can.\n\n225\n00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.020\nIt's like anything else.\n\n226\n00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.660\nThe very fact is\neverything's time sensitive.\n\n227\n00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.460\nSo you don't test for I call them zebras.\n\n228\n00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.171\nYou test for horses.\n\n229\n00:12:21.171 --> 00:12:24.090\nIn other words,\nthe big more common types of errors.\n\n230\n00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:27.500\nDon't get me wrong, can there be\nthose particular types of unicorns or\n\n231\n00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:28.240\nzebras out there?\n\n232\n00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.670\nAbsolutely.\n\n233\n00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.520\nCan they mess up your network just\nas fast as kind of the big ones?\n\n234\n00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.510\nYes.\n\n235\n00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:37.560\nBut in terms of production, you've got\nto also note, especially when using\n\n236\n00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:42.130\nthese tools, it's easier to try and\nlook for the more common errors and\n\n237\n00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:48.020\nthen be able tweak what you need to, to\nfind those more uncommon errors instead.\n\n238\n00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.890\nDon't start off with the hardest\nthing on the world, and\n\n239\n00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.060\nsay, I'm testing off of that,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n240\n00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.270\nAnd then, you start realizing something,\njust through statistics.\n\n241\n00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.781\nThat's a one and-\n&gt;&gt; Probability\n\n242\n00:12:58.781 --> 00:13:00.301\n[INAUDIBLE] [CROSSTALK] incident\noccurring is [INAUDIBLE] plus.\n\n243\n00:13:00.301 --> 00:13:02.495\n&gt;&gt; 9 million chance of occurring\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n244\n00:13:02.495 --> 00:13:03.760\n&gt;&gt; Than the other thing.\n\n245\n00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.310\n&gt;&gt; So that's why they tend to\nfollow those types of procedures.\n\n246\n00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:10.820\nNow, if you're going, so Ronnie, what\nare some of the tools that are available?\n\n247\n00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:15.950\nWell, let's show you just a few of them,\nthat you might likely be able to find and\n\n248\n00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.418\nsee even on your own.\n\n249\n00:13:17.418 --> 00:13:20.370\nSo I'm gonna ahead and pulled up some\ndifferent websites to help us out, and\n\n250\n00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.070\nshow you just some of\nthe ones that are available.\n\n251\n00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:27.340\nSo here, we've actually even used\nthis site in another episode before\n\n252\n00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.800\nhere on the CompTIA SEcurity, plus show.\n\n253\n00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.320\nThis is cert.org if you\nhaven't seen it up here.\n\n254\n00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.430\nCert.org and this one's under\nvulnerability analysis and tools and\n\n255\n00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:43.630\nthere is one that is that is known\nas the failure observation engine.\n\n256\n00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:48.310\nNow, in this failure observation engine,\nthe key here is that this is designed for\n\n257\n00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.090\nWindows platform.\n\n258\n00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:53.510\nFirst and\nforemost you got to be running Windows.\n\n259\n00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.130\nSo if you are actually gonna do this and\n\n260\n00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.850\nyou are trying to verify things,\nyou might do this and\n\n261\n00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:03.800\nit does what you call mutational fuzzing\non the software that consumes file input.\n\n262\n00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.190\nSo if you know that there's actually\ngonna be input that's gonna be run here,\n\n263\n00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:11.970\nit actually has the ability to do a lot\nmore for you by actually being able to\n\n264\n00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:15.980\nchange the way it actually inputs\nthe data over time as well.\n\n265\n00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:20.150\nSo this is something you can go ahead and\ndownload directly from their site as well.\n\n266\n00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:23.730\nAnd, of course, you can even\nread a little bit more to them.\n\n267\n00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.210\nThis is the one that\nactually intrigued me,\n\n268\n00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:28.400\nthe one word trick for\nfinding more crashes.\n\n269\n00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.038\nSo it's a very good site for\nyou to think about.\n\n270\n00:14:31.038 --> 00:14:37.265\nSo that's kinda the more generic one in\nterms of finding failures that can hop.\n\n271\n00:14:37.265 --> 00:14:41.885\nNow, there's also a course if you're\ntalking about fuzzing specifically.\n\n272\n00:14:41.885 --> 00:14:45.610\nOver here on the left-hand side I just\nclick on this one that said buzz of\n\n273\n00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.630\nBasic Fuzzing Framework.\n\n274\n00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.090\nSo basic fuzzing framework.\n\n275\n00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.690\nBF, what does this stand for?\n\n276\n00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:54.360\nBFF.\n&gt;&gt; BFF, well it's kinda funny.\n\n277\n00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.650\nWhen you pulled up that last page I was\nactually thinking BFF is like your friend\n\n278\n00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:02.620\nversus foe for FLE so maybe that's\none way you could remember it but\n\n279\n00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.030\nyou're not gonna have to specifically\ncalled this terms as an example Ronnie\n\n280\n00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:06.992\njust showing you-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n281\n00:15:06.992 --> 00:15:08.330\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] examples.\n\n282\n00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.380\nI always try to find\nassociations theres so\n\n283\n00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.720\nmany acronyms out there that it helps-\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n284\n00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.560\n&gt;&gt; Me anyways.\n\n285\n00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.150\n&gt;&gt; No, there's no doubt that it\ndoes help you remember this.\n\n286\n00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.650\nSo it's not that important that you\nremember tools you we just trying to\n\n287\n00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:19.250\nshow you few.\n\n288\n00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.160\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; The first one is the more generic\n\n289\n00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.040\ntype of scanner that can help you out.\n\n290\n00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.650\nThis one, of course,\nis design specifically for fuzzing.\n\n291\n00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:28.880\nFirst one only for Windows,\nthis window take a look here.\n\n292\n00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:34.198\nMicrosoft Windows, Linux, Mac OSX,\nother UNIX like platforms as well.\n\n293\n00:15:34.198 --> 00:15:38.255\nSo if you have running a MAC like I am,\nyou can run it here.\n\n294\n00:15:38.255 --> 00:15:43.264\nAnd it might actually kinda throw a little\nbit more of a shock but overall though you\n\n295\n00:15:43.264 --> 00:15:47.910\nhave a lot different things that you can\nthen use as and just simply add in a few\n\n296\n00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:52.723\nelements that you need to, that you want\nto add in in that fuzzing element too.\n\n297\n00:15:52.723 --> 00:15:56.427\nNow, there's a more generic one\nthat's also out there as well.\n\n298\n00:15:56.427 --> 00:16:00.487\nAnd this is one, I don't know\nhow recommended this one is, but\n\n299\n00:16:00.487 --> 00:16:04.101\nit actually seems to be kind\nof this is the easy version.\n\n300\n00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:06.246\n&gt;&gt; American fuzzy lop.\n\n301\n00:16:06.246 --> 00:16:06.818\nOkay.\n\n302\n00:16:06.818 --> 00:16:08.225\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, American fuzzy lop.\n\n303\n00:16:08.225 --> 00:16:11.139\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; There's actually a fuzzer tool that\n\n304\n00:16:11.139 --> 00:16:13.340\nreally does help us here.\n\n305\n00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:20.444\nAnd this one is really very generic, very\nsimple, and that's why I like it overall.\n\n306\n00:16:20.444 --> 00:16:24.821\nAnd the reason why is because, it says,\nit's designed to be practical,\n\n307\n00:16:24.821 --> 00:16:27.100\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n308\n00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.650\nAnd it has a couple of features\nin terms of its practicality,\n\n309\n00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.540\nmodest overhead performance,\nuses a variety of highly effective fuzzing\n\n310\n00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:39.860\nstrategy, an effort minimization tricks\n\n311\n00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.635\nrequires essentially no configuration and\nthat's the big one for me.\n\n312\n00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:45.705\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Is that it requires no real\n\n313\n00:16:45.705 --> 00:16:50.290\nconfiguration and\nhandles complex real-world use cases, so-\n\n314\n00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:51.230\n&gt;&gt; They don't mention speed.\n\n315\n00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.550\nI wonder if, because these tests\ncan tend to run for a while.\n\n316\n00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:54.680\nSo I wonder if it's a little faster.\n\n317\n00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.170\n&gt;&gt; They will run for a while.\n\n318\n00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:57.220\nIt's fairly fast.\n\n319\n00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.660\nIt actually use modern resources here.\n\n320\n00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.590\nSo you can go to those pages, and let me\nmake sure I point that one out again.\n\n321\n00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:05.730\nAnd so, here's the link.\n\n322\n00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:08.750\nAnd we'll also have these, of course,\nin the show notes as well so\n\n323\n00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.700\nthat you can find it again, too.\n\n324\n00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.660\nSo all of these are actually very good,\nsolid ones that you'll end up seeing.\n\n325\n00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:16.640\nAnd there's even more.\n\n326\n00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.962\nI didn't show you all of them.\n\n327\n00:17:17.962 --> 00:17:19.830\nI kinda showed you some of the basic ones.\n\n328\n00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:23.460\nThe nice thing about this is that a lot of\nthe people that are using this American\n\n329\n00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.780\nfuzzy lop here.\n\n330\n00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:31.740\nAmerican fuzzy lop is that the community\nessentially contributes when they\n\n331\n00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.260\nfind another type of code.\n\n332\n00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.640\nAnd so,\nit's really community sponsored and\n\n333\n00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.261\nyou can see right here they talk\nabout the bug-o-rama trophy case.\n\n334\n00:17:40.261 --> 00:17:40.777\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's funny.\n\n335\n00:17:40.777 --> 00:17:46.477\n&gt;&gt; So these are different bugs that\nthe American fuzzy lopper really did,\n\n336\n00:17:46.477 --> 00:17:51.227\nend up helping to find and\ncontributed back to the community\n\n337\n00:17:51.227 --> 00:17:55.700\nthat made it more specific for\nthem to be able to do this.\n\n338\n00:17:55.700 --> 00:18:00.650\nSo it really is a great little tool when\nyou talk about the idea of fuzzing here.\n\n339\n00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:04.980\nDefinitely something that will be helpful\nespecially when you're doing testing\n\n340\n00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:09.850\non your application such as the web\nserver that you have continued.\n\n341\n00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:14.480\nSo fuzzing is one of those controls\nthat you can really take advantage of,\n\n342\n00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.160\nthat can help you to show\nthe different types of\n\n343\n00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.430\nbugs that are also in the coding\nof your site as well.\n\n344\n00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:26.745\nSo one that you wanna take advantage of\nespecially if you're developing this for\n\n345\n00:18:26.745 --> 00:18:29.806\nsomething that's gonna\nbe put in the public.\n\n346\n00:18:29.806 --> 00:18:34.488\nNow, the other thing we have to be\nconcerned about then is the idea of\n\n347\n00:18:34.488 --> 00:18:36.310\nsecure coding concepts.\n\n348\n00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:41.427\nNow, when we talk about this idea\nof secure coding concepts there\n\n349\n00:18:41.427 --> 00:18:45.931\nare a bunch of people that are natural\nat coding the way that they want to.\n\n350\n00:18:45.931 --> 00:18:48.270\nAnd that absolutely works.\n\n351\n00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.290\nThey make the most beautiful\napplications in the world.\n\n352\n00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:53.520\nThey follow the concepts that they want.\n\n353\n00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:59.490\nNobody ever really takes into\nconsideration anything that's really bad.\n\n354\n00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.890\nIn other words, they look at, beautiful\nprogram, or beautiful application that's\n\n355\n00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:09.010\nwritten works near flawlessly if\nnot exactly, not 100% flawlessly.\n\n356\n00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:14.285\nBut then when they put it out into\nthe real world, they find out something,\n\n357\n00:19:14.285 --> 00:19:20.512\nthat it's designed for 100% functionality,\ndesigned for almost 0% security.\n\n358\n00:19:20.512 --> 00:19:22.826\nAnd that's where the problems come in.\n\n359\n00:19:22.826 --> 00:19:27.319\nIf you're only designing a web site to\nprove concepts of your web design and\n\n360\n00:19:27.319 --> 00:19:31.686\nthe elegance of it, and\nthe functionality of it, 100% high marks.\n\n361\n00:19:31.686 --> 00:19:33.181\nIf you're doing this for\n\n362\n00:19:33.181 --> 00:19:37.667\ne-commerce, if you're doing this to\nactually have an online presence,\n\n363\n00:19:37.667 --> 00:19:42.082\nthat's gonna connect to a database\nwhich is gonna connect to accounts and\n\n364\n00:19:42.082 --> 00:19:46.280\nstuff like that, you gotta think about\nthe way that you code things and\n\n365\n00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:51.960\nmake sure that they are following secure\ncoding concepts from the very beginning.\n\n366\n00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.990\nAnd that means there's a lot of\nchecks that you have to put in place.\n\n367\n00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:58.149\nAnd if you don't,\nif you don't know what these controls are,\n\n368\n00:19:58.149 --> 00:20:00.421\nthey're really going to\nhurt you in the end.\n\n369\n00:20:00.421 --> 00:20:04.000\nAnd there's a whole bunch of them\nthat you have to think about.\n\n370\n00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.220\nSo we're just gonna talk\nabout a few of them as well.\n\n371\n00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.540\nSo the first and foremost one that\nwe wanna make sure that we mention\n\n372\n00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.790\nis the idea of error and\nexception handling.\n\n373\n00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:18.250\nNow, when we talk about this idea, it's\nnot that we don't expect error to happen.\n\n374\n00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:22.200\nSomebody could punch in\nthe wrong information.\n\n375\n00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.680\nWhat we want something that says, hey,\nthis is invalid or something like that.\n\n376\n00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.569\nBut what we don't want though is that\nerror might lead them to someplace that\n\n377\n00:20:30.569 --> 00:20:32.100\nthey're not supposed to go.\n\n378\n00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:37.280\nSo they punch in something and\nthey're shown a particular error.\n\n379\n00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:40.006\nAnd now all of the sudden they\nclick on something else and\n\n380\n00:20:40.006 --> 00:20:44.009\nit gets redirected to a webpage and now a\ntake look at their address bar and they're\n\n381\n00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:48.261\nat some other server and then you're like,\n[SOUND] wait a minute, what happened here?\n\n382\n00:20:48.261 --> 00:20:50.325\nMost people may never\nactually know about it but\n\n383\n00:20:50.325 --> 00:20:53.170\nif you're an attacker you might\nhave actually understood that.\n\n384\n00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:54.598\nWhatever you just did.\n\n385\n00:20:54.598 --> 00:20:55.150\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n386\n00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:57.960\n&gt;&gt; Caused an error and then gave you\nenough information that lead you someplace\n\n387\n00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.940\nthat you weren't supposed to be.\n\n388\n00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.200\n&gt;&gt; Like we mentioned before,\nthose little nuggets.\n\n389\n00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.510\nAnd the attacker, they're looking for\nany little bit of information.\n\n390\n00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:11.930\nSo even if the way that that action\ngenerates a particular error,\n\n391\n00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:15.430\nit can clue that attacker in onto what\nkind of operating system you're using.\n\n392\n00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:19.440\nAny kinda configurations that if\nthey're familiar with that they can\n\n393\n00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.393\nassociate that with a particular\nvulnerability, as well.\n\n394\n00:21:22.393 --> 00:21:27.013\nAnd it's kinda funny if you see certain\nwebsites, they have it's a really fun\n\n395\n00:21:27.013 --> 00:21:31.920\nway to kind of interject some corporate or\ncompany personality into those errors.\n\n396\n00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.884\nYou can customize your errors so\n\n397\n00:21:33.884 --> 00:21:37.385\nthat you're essentially\nconcealing any information.\n\n398\n00:21:37.385 --> 00:21:39.745\nAnd when through the testing\nprocess you wanna test that and\n\n399\n00:21:39.745 --> 00:21:41.305\nmake sure that they're\ndisplaying properly.\n\n400\n00:21:41.305 --> 00:21:45.560\nHave you ever tried to access\nthe Internet with Google Chrome and\n\n401\n00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.690\ndidn't have Internet connectivity?\n\n402\n00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:48.240\n&gt;&gt; I have not.\n\n403\n00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.105\nI don't think I have.\n\n404\n00:21:49.105 --> 00:21:52.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] If you hit the space bar,\nthere's all of a sudden,\n\n405\n00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:57.590\nthe error message turns into a little game\nor you have a T-rex jumping over cacti.\n\n406\n00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:00.200\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I have seen people actually\ndo that here when that happens\n\n407\n00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.300\nevery once in a while.\n\n408\n00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.170\nSo there's a lot of different things,\nbut that's one of them.\n\n409\n00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.380\nWe don't want to expose\ntoo much information.\n\n410\n00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.530\nWe want the error to be meaningful.\n\n411\n00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:12.120\nAnd this is where we can get\nunusual complaints, too, at times,\n\n412\n00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.970\nespecially if it's a public website.\n\n413\n00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:16.910\nSo like the one that\nCherokee was mentioning,\n\n414\n00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:20.280\nit normally displays a cute little message\nthat says, hey, something's wrong.\n\n415\n00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:21.880\nBut just take the time here and\n\n416\n00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.600\nPlay a few rounds of this game-\n&gt;&gt; Distraction.\n\n417\n00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.624\n&gt;&gt; Distraction.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, [LAUGH]\n\n418\n00:22:24.624 --> 00:22:25.554\n&gt;&gt; While this is happening so\n\n419\n00:22:25.554 --> 00:22:27.130\nyou don't get as frustrated.\n\n420\n00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:28.880\nBut when you do something like that,\n\n421\n00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.170\nyou might find other people tend to\nfind that as being kind of gamey.\n\n422\n00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.035\nI don't know, just chintzy.\n\n423\n00:22:35.035 --> 00:22:39.422\nAnd they do complain,\nlike well aren't you an actual business,\n\n424\n00:22:39.422 --> 00:22:41.670\nwhat type of thing are you doing?\n\n425\n00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.215\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What about like\nour blue screen here shows?\n\n426\n00:22:44.215 --> 00:22:45.015\nI like it.\n\n427\n00:22:45.015 --> 00:22:48.615\n&gt;&gt; I like it too but sometimes you\nactually do get people that end up saying\n\n428\n00:22:48.615 --> 00:22:50.195\nthat's not really an error message,\n\n429\n00:22:50.195 --> 00:22:53.135\nthat's something you're trying to\nbe cute when and it's not like,\n\n430\n00:22:53.135 --> 00:22:57.160\nno, the goal and idea is so that you don't\nget upset where said, just take a break.\n\n431\n00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:57.882\nDo something like that for a month.\n\n432\n00:22:57.882 --> 00:22:58.691\n&gt;&gt; Chillax!\n\n433\n00:22:58.691 --> 00:22:59.256\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n\n434\n00:22:59.256 --> 00:23:03.370\nI don't know if I had ever used that\nword chillax except in this show.\n\n435\n00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:04.390\nSo there you go.\n\n436\n00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:05.910\nThere's a new word.\n\n437\n00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.810\nNow, the other one is by\nfar the most important one.\n\n438\n00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:09.370\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n439\n00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.690\n&gt;&gt; Just about everything that we do.\n\n440\n00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:15.680\nIt comes down to input validation.\n\n441\n00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.270\nNow, input validation.\n\n442\n00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:21.260\nThat sounds like two complex words,\nCherokee.\n\n443\n00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.520\nWhen you think, when you hear that term,\ninput validation,\n\n444\n00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.230\nwhat immediately comes to your mind?\n\n445\n00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:30.460\nSo, immediately I think about attacks\nsuch as integers overflow and so\n\n446\n00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:35.438\nforth because, so\nthis is like confession time.\n\n447\n00:23:35.438 --> 00:23:38.233\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n&gt;&gt; I know, I do a lot of online shopping.\n\n448\n00:23:38.233 --> 00:23:38.743\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n449\n00:23:38.743 --> 00:23:39.982\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's not you.\n\n450\n00:23:39.982 --> 00:23:41.251\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n451\n00:23:41.251 --> 00:23:44.026\nI have to fill up forms\nyou put in your address.\n\n452\n00:23:44.026 --> 00:23:46.757\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; If there are any kind of let's say,\n\n453\n00:23:46.757 --> 00:23:51.726\nI'm putting in my ZIP code, and the input\nfield is larger than what I'm trying\n\n454\n00:23:51.726 --> 00:23:55.892\nto put in, it could cause It's\na vulnerability, in that sense.\n\n455\n00:23:55.892 --> 00:23:59.011\nAnd, that's a pretty big\nvulnerability because when\n\n456\n00:23:59.011 --> 00:24:01.994\nwe're dealing with things\nlike our credit cards and\n\n457\n00:24:01.994 --> 00:24:06.430\nany kind of PII that pie that needs to\nbe protected, I'm gonna be concerned.\n\n458\n00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:12.090\nSo, I definitely took some time to pay\nattention to this one studying, and what\n\n459\n00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:15.880\nwas the other thing I was gonna mention,\nlike for your bank accounts right.\n\n460\n00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:23.070\nYou could essentially turn\na positive account into negative\n\n461\n00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:27.840\nby using these types of attack, so it's\ndefinitely some serious stuff to look at.\n\n462\n00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what we want here when we start\ntalking about the area of input validation\n\n463\n00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:34.040\nis that when we do fill out forms.\n\n464\n00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:38.050\n&gt;&gt; What ever it is, that the users\nis going to provide for us that not\n\n465\n00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:42.930\ndo any thing, unexpected in that way and\nwe can put some controls on that.\n\n466\n00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:45.110\nFor example, where my name I fill out or\n\n467\n00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:48.118\nmy e-mail address which\nis really all I need.\n\n468\n00:24:48.118 --> 00:24:52.610\nWhat instead if I actually ended up\nputting in there or a date field instead.\n\n469\n00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:54.730\nOr even if we go to the idea\nof a date field and\n\n470\n00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:58.350\ndecided to put a line of SQL coding.\n\n471\n00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:02.190\nVery simple SQL coding and\nsee what the return gives me.\n\n472\n00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:06.290\nSo when you do input validation\nyou're essentially just taking all\n\n473\n00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:07.830\nof those chances out and\n\n474\n00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:11.860\nsaying we're gonna actually leave\nwhatever's inputted in here, as just text.\n\n475\n00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.710\nWe're not gonna allow it\nto actually run as coding.\n\n476\n00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:16.110\nWe're gonna actually do this or that.\n\n477\n00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:17.740\nYou can actually make it run as coding.\n\n478\n00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.060\nBut you can actually strip\nout other things in there.\n\n479\n00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.790\nAs long as you know exactly\nwhat's going to happen.\n\n480\n00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:28.310\nSo, input validation by far it probably\neffects every single website should do,\n\n481\n00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:31.170\nof course do it every single\napplication should do it.\n\n482\n00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.960\nBut overall though if you wanna talk about\nthe bugs that are generally found it's\n\n483\n00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:38.250\ngonna be input validation\ntypes of bugs as well, okay.\n\n484\n00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:41.620\nYou wanna make sure that you always\nvalidate just any input at all,\n\n485\n00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.920\nespecially from any untrusted source.\n\n486\n00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:48.130\nNever give anybody the advantage by\nsaying no this doesn't matter if this is\n\n487\n00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:49.180\nvalidated or not.\n\n488\n00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:52.060\nYou always want to be sure that\nif somebody else has access\n\n489\n00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.480\nto be on put something on your data base.\n\n490\n00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.370\nThat's always going to be exactly\nwhat you want to allow in it and\n\n491\n00:25:57.370 --> 00:25:59.600\nnothing else there to, okay.\n\n492\n00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.540\nWhatever security passage\nyou have in place,\n\n493\n00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:05.940\nyou also want to make sure that those\ncan be enforced, for your coding too.\n\n494\n00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:08.580\nAnd this is something that every\ndeveloper should think about.\n\n495\n00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.180\nOkay, it's not enough to\njust give functionality,\n\n496\n00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:15.420\nit has to function in the real world and\nthereby even your coding\n\n497\n00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:19.740\nhas to also take into account\nthe security policies we put in place.\n\n498\n00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:24.550\nThere's a ton of different things that we\ncan actually add in here and depending on\n\n499\n00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:31.610\nwhether your security aware is greater\nwhether you are medium ground here,\n\n500\n00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:35.120\nwhere you got, it doesn't matter\nbecause everything behind the firewall,\n\n501\n00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:39.460\nyou need at least to know those\nbasic here and your application.\n\n502\n00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:43.124\nVerify the error and\nexception handling Is ready to go and\n\n503\n00:26:43.124 --> 00:26:45.690\nof course input validation.\n\n504\n00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:49.830\nThere are a ton of different sites\nthat can even tell you in a list or\n\n505\n00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:55.050\nenumerate a lot more different\nthings that we can talk about, okay.\n\n506\n00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:57.640\nBut overall though those\nare kind of the two main ones.\n\n507\n00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:03.390\nNow, if you're saying so what if I\nam gonna program an application and\n\n508\n00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.980\nI need to actually make\nsure that it's secure,\n\n509\n00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:11.920\nWell it really does come down to what type\nof application that you're talking about.\n\n510\n00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:15.254\nSo, let me show you a couple of them, too.\n\n511\n00:27:15.254 --> 00:27:19.147\nNow, let's go ahead and\ngo to my screen here and we'll see this.\n\n512\n00:27:19.147 --> 00:27:21.600\nAnd I forgot to show one other\nthing which was peach fuzzer.\n\n513\n00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.020\nSo, you can look that one up on your own,\nI didn't realized I have done that.\n\n514\n00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.020\nYeah, that one is a great little tool but\n\n515\n00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.520\noverall though those are the three\nkind of do the same thing.\n\n516\n00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.810\nSo you can see that, okay?\n\n517\n00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:35.180\nNow, here if you are actually developing,\n\n518\n00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.730\nlet me zoom in so\nthat we understand, right.\n\n519\n00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:42.456\nIf you are now coding using\nprogramming language such as C, C++,\n\n520\n00:27:42.456 --> 00:27:47.180\nPerl Java and Android, and\nthat's why I also put this in here.\n\n521\n00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.420\nIt's for smaller hand held devices,\n\n522\n00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.190\nwell you wanna make sure that you\nfollow secure coding standards.\n\n523\n00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.960\nAnd right here,\nis where you can actually go and get this.\n\n524\n00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:00.680\nSo this one's again still that\nsame CERT website here, but\n\n525\n00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.480\nthis one is securecoding.cert.org.\n\n526\n00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.530\nAnd you'll be able to find the guides that\nare, the standards that are actually in\n\n527\n00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.980\nplace and you'll see that that's\nwhat they're actually looking at.\n\n528\n00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.700\nAll of these different areas,\nmake sure that if your company says hey,\n\n529\n00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.860\nthis is how we're doing\nthe coding standard,\n\n530\n00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.850\nfollow whatever they give you but\nhere's a good guideline for one, okay?\n\n531\n00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.880\nNow, the other one of course is,\nlook at that Microsoft.\n\n532\n00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.620\nOkay, we are going\nMicrosoft Developer Network, really?\n\n533\n00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.340\nYes, that's right.\n\n534\n00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:31.670\nIf you're doing stuff in\nthe .NET framework and\n\n535\n00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:35.050\nyou're gonna be integrating with that,\nyou also wanna make sure you follow\n\n536\n00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:37.990\nthe secure coding standards\nthat are also here too.\n\n537\n00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:41.950\nAnd you can see how they give you\nan overview, permission request,\n\n538\n00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:44.090\nsecuring method, you name it.\n\n539\n00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:48.080\nThey go through just about everything that\nyou need to ensure the security of your\n\n540\n00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.850\napplication as well and\nthere's ASP.NET, Code Access Security,\n\n541\n00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:58.500\nRole Based Security, you name it they\nprovide a whole list of standard there for\n\n542\n00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:03.690\nthat as well, Of course,\nif you're actually, Oracle.\n\n543\n00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:08.180\nSo here's more database stuff,\nsecure coding standards once again.\n\n544\n00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.800\nSo, notice that there's a lot, and\n\n545\n00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.500\nlet's say, of course I don't want to\nleave this one out, your Apple apps.\n\n546\n00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:19.160\nSo, if you are really coding things for\nan Apple app., I'm gonna say apped.\n\n547\n00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.320\nApp at some point, you want to make\nsure you also follow their standards.\n\n548\n00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.800\nSo it's not a one size fits all.\n\n549\n00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.770\nYou've gotta take a look at all those\ndifferent options that are available.\n\n550\n00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:32.130\nEspecially if security\nis important to you.\n\n551\n00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:36.860\nAnd so, most of us, that's what we're here\nfor, is to learn more about security.\n\n552\n00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.320\nBut if we're actually one of\nthe people that's gonna be helping and\n\n553\n00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.550\ntesting in this,\nwe've gotta at least be familiar with\n\n554\n00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.640\nunderstanding what types of\napps we're gonna end up seeing.\n\n555\n00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.140\nAs well as actually understanding the\nconcepts that we've been talking about.\n\n556\n00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.960\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie, I think that\nabout does it for this episode.\n\n557\n00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:56.020\nWe still have a lot more application\nsecurity controls to go over.\n\n558\n00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:57.080\nSo don't go anywhere, guys.\n\n559\n00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.860\nWe have a lot coming your way.\n\n560\n00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.990\nSo, thank you for being with us today,\nwe appreciate that.\n\n561\n00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:04.750\nI'm your host Cherokee Boose\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n562\n00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:08.027\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here on ITPRO.TV.\n\n563\n00:30:08.027 --> 00:30:14.196\n[MUSIC]\n\n564\n00:30:14.196 --> 00:30:17.079\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITPRO.TV.\n\n",

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon and good evening and\n\n5\n00:00:33,512 --> 00:00:35,405\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITPro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:36,570\nI'm your host Don Pezet.\n\n7\n00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,350\nBack again with Mr. Nate Copeland.\n\n8\n00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,260\nHow's it going, Nate?\n\n9\n00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:39,950\n>> Pretty good, Don.\n\n10\n00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,520\nPretty good.\nI'm fired up for\n\n11\n00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,330\nanother great show of security plus today\nand we're now getting into the realm of\n\n12\n00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:51,160\nhost security along in our little set\nin our track of security stuff today.\n\n13\n00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,480\nAnd it is, yeah,\nit's gonna be a pretty good one.\n\n14\n00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,810\n>> Yeah, you know we,\nwe talked a bit about host base security.\n\n15\n00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:57,490\nWell, not, not much.\n\n16\n00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,450\nWe focused more on programs, right, and\nsecuring programs in the last episode.\n\n17\n00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,070\nSo, in this one we're gonna talk\nabout the hosts themselves, and it's\n\n18\n00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,140\neasy in our minds to kind of pigeon holes\nourselves when we talk about hosts and\n\n19\n00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,475\nthink about servers.\n\n20\n00:01:09,475 --> 00:01:12,580\nCuz we do spend a lot of\ntime securing servers.\n\n21\n00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,320\nBut the most vulnerable element in our\nnetwork is oftentimes our clients, right?\n\n22\n00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,535\nYour clients that are being\nused by your end users,\n\n23\n00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:22,265\nyour end users who are effectively\nyour enemy because they just\n\n24\n00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:25,559\nwon't follow the directions that you\nset out, and so that is a challenge and\n\n25\n00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:28,110\nthere's a lot of stuff that you\nhave to do on the host side.\n\n26\n00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,623\nSo this particular objective 4.3, oh, I've\ngot it right here on my computer screen.\n\n27\n00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:34,017\nI'm trying to get my paper notes.\n\n28\n00:01:34,017 --> 00:01:35,365\nIt's given a scenario,\n\n29\n00:01:35,365 --> 00:01:39,400\nselect the appropriate solution\nto establish host security.\n\n30\n00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,090\nMost of these topics,\nwe've already talked about.\n\n31\n00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,540\nSo, what they're really getting\nat here in this objective,\n\n32\n00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,590\nis knowing the scenario\nwhen they're appropriate.\n\n33\n00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,960\nAll right,\nwhen is a particular tool appropriate?\n\n34\n00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,820\nAnd so you'll see a lot of things.\n\n35\n00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,200\nOperating system security and settings,\nwe've been talking about that,\n\n36\n00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,420\npractically the whole show, all the\ndifferent things we can secure in an OS.\n\n37\n00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,710\nSo, when are those appropriate?\n\n38\n00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,420\nWell, those are appropriate when we're\nconcerned about the operating system\n\n39\n00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,980\nitself being the target, all right?\n\n40\n00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,620\nNow, a lot of attacks don't\ntarget the operating system.\n\n41\n00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,310\nA lot of attacks target your web browser,\nor an application that you run, or\n\n42\n00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,980\nthe user themselves.\n\n43\n00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,530\nThey don't target the OS.\n\n44\n00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,770\nBut there are several well-known direct\noperating system attacks that are out\n\n45\n00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,520\nthere, and so, in those scenarios, we need\nto make sure that we tweak the security.\n\n46\n00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,770\nNow, it is possible to eliminate\nthe operating system as a target,\n\n47\n00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,560\nand one of the best ways to do that is\nto implement something called a trusted\n\n48\n00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,405\noperating system.\n\n49\n00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:41,540\nI'm jumping ahead a little bit,\nit's further down in the, in the list.\n\n50\n00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,570\nBut you'll see down here,\ntrusted OS, right?\n\n51\n00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,420\nA trusted OS is an operating system that\n\n52\n00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,760\nis doing as much as it can to ensure that\nit can't be the target of an attack.\n\n53\n00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,890\nAnd one of the best ways to do that\nis to not allow third party software,\n\n54\n00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,610\nto only software that's been\ndigitally signed and trusted and\n\n55\n00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,840\nauthorized to run and\nnot just software, but\n\n56\n00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,420\nyour hardware drivers also, every element\nof that that chain needs to be secured.\n\n57\n00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,540\nIn the old days,\n\n58\n00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,440\nthere were only a handful of operating\nsystems that were considered trusted.\n\n59\n00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,020\nNowadays there's actually quite\na few including Windows 7 and\n\n60\n00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,390\nWindows Server 2008 R2.\n\n61\n00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,590\nNot Windows 8, it's not certified yet and\nWindows server 2012 is not certified yet.\n\n62\n00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,980\nThere's several Linux distros,\nCilarus, even Mac OS are,\n\n63\n00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,140\nare certified as being trusted OSs.\n\n64\n00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,870\nThe default installs are not trusted.\n\n65\n00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,550\nThey don't meet the requirements.\n\n66\n00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,850\nBut if we adjust our\noperating system security and\n\n67\n00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,510\nsettings, and tweak them, and set them to\nonly run digitally signed software and\n\n68\n00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,280\nonly run software that we trust, then they\nbecome that trusted operating system.\n\n69\n00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,570\nWe also meet other requirements\nlike common criteria requirements,\n\n70\n00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,620\nand FIPS compliance and\n\n71\n00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,800\nall the various other things tha,\nlike the US government requires.\n\n72\n00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,318\nWe've seen how effective that is, right?\n\n73\n00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:01,889\n[LAUGH]\n>> But, but\n\n74\n00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:05,037\nthose things that the government requires\nto have that operating system be trusted.\n\n75\n00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:08,593\nOne of the big benefits, slash,\nnegatives of a trusted OS,\n\n76\n00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:12,750\nis you can't just download random\nsoftware and install it on it.\n\n77\n00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,820\nRight?\nIt's restricted,\n\n78\n00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,040\nyou're only running authorizes software.\n\n79\n00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,670\nThat means if your machine tries\nto install a virus, right, or\n\n80\n00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,230\nmalicious software, or\na Trojan, it won't be allowed,\n\n81\n00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,990\nbecause it won't be digitally signed,\nor it won't be in your approved list.\n\n82\n00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,660\nSo that's kind of the advantage there.\n\n83\n00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,030\nIt allows us to eliminate the operating\nsystem as the target, all right?\n\n84\n00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,300\nNow, what scenario would call for\nsomething like that?\n\n85\n00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,340\nMission critical or\ndedicated systems, all right?\n\n86\n00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,640\nEmbedded systems really call for this.\n\n87\n00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,220\nTake for example in the US, our,\n\n88\n00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,120\nour United States military has\na tank called the M1 Abrams tank.\n\n89\n00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,530\nIt is a technological marvel.\n\n90\n00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,730\nFrom the outside it's a tank.\n\n91\n00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,347\nIt looks tanks that were\nused in World War II.\n\n92\n00:04:52,347 --> 00:04:52,847\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n93\n00:04:52,847 --> 00:04:53,900\nNothing special there.\n\n94\n00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,100\nBut on the inside it\nis fully computerized.\n\n95\n00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,210\nThey have numerous computer screens\nin there that are showing battlefield\n\n96\n00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,240\nreports, ammunition and\nfuel information, geographical and\n\n97\n00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,720\ntopo, topological information.\n\n98\n00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,800\nAll sorts of stuff.\n\n99\n00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,220\nI mean, it's some high tech equipment.\n\n100\n00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,800\nWell, imagine if somebody\nwere able to hack into that.\n\n101\n00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,240\nIf somebody were able to get\na virus into that software.\n\n102\n00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,740\nAll the sudden you could take a multi\nmillion dollar machine of destruction and\n\n103\n00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,510\nrender it useless, right?\n\n104\n00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,865\nSo in that scenario, you need\nan operating system that is a trusted OS,\n\n105\n00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:27,860\nthat can be secured, that's not going to\nallow unauthorized software to execute,\n\n106\n00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,935\nthat's only going to run the mission\ncontrol software and that's it.\n\n107\n00:05:31,935 --> 00:05:32,710\nRight?\n\n108\n00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,480\nReally, any embedded system it\ndoesn't have to be a military device.\n\n109\n00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,850\nIt could be a medical device, right?\n\n110\n00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,390\nYou can't walk into a hospital\nwithout seeing Windows\n\n111\n00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,580\nworkstations all over the place where\nthey're running their X-ray software and\n\n112\n00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,010\nall that,\nthose need to be trusted systems too.\n\n113\n00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:53,450\nAgain, prevent accidental leaking of, of\npatient records, and stuff of that nature.\n\n114\n00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:57,423\n>> So then how, so then you know, one of\nthe items on there with operating system\n\n115\n00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:01,224\nhardening, you know one that you know,\nwe have talked about a bit before and,\n\n116\n00:06:01,224 --> 00:06:04,010\ndisabling unneeded services and\nthose sorts of things.\n\n117\n00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:08,930\nSo then, so how would you tie then trusted\nOS to just hardening an operating system.\n\n118\n00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,490\n>> Well, take for example, Red Hat Linux.\n\n119\n00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,280\nWhen you install Red Hat Linux,\n\n120\n00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,610\nit has SE Linux running on\nthe security extensions for Linux.\n\n121\n00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,820\nAnd SE Linux is a key component\nof making a Linux distro\n\n122\n00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,970\nto be a trusted OS, right?\n\n123\n00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,870\nBut if you go out and\nyou employ something like Linux Mint,\n\n124\n00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,460\nwhich is a perfectly good distro, it does\nnot have SE Linux deployed by default.\n\n125\n00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,240\nRight?\n\n126\n00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,830\nBut you can get it,\nyou can compile it, install it,\n\n127\n00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,650\nand run it on top of Linux mint.\n\n128\n00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,940\nSo when you get it, the distro is fine,\nbut it's not a trusted OS.\n\n129\n00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,000\nAnd then you deploy SELinux\non it to harden it,\n\n130\n00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,585\nto strengthen the security on that system\nso that it becomes a trusted OS, and so\n\n131\n00:06:52,585 --> 00:06:54,825\nthat's an example where we\nwould need to harden that.\n\n132\n00:06:54,825 --> 00:06:56,195\nBut also just stopping services and\n\n133\n00:06:56,195 --> 00:06:58,770\nwhich again we've talked\nabout in other episodes.\n\n134\n00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,215\nThe, the distributors of the software\ndon't always package it in the most secure\n\n135\n00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:06,980\nform when you get it, a lot of times they\npackage it in the most convenient form.\n\n136\n00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,650\nAnd then we need to go back and\nrevisit that to secure it.\n\n137\n00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,620\nOn your laptop at home that may not\nbe something you care about, but\n\n138\n00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,865\non a web server facing the internet,\nit is.\n\n139\n00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:16,000\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n140\n00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,980\n>> All right, other things to think about.\n\n141\n00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,790\nRight, especially when\nwe're dealing with hosts.\n\n142\n00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:25,030\nHost-based intrusion prevention systems,\nright?\n\n143\n00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,240\nYou'll hear this referred\nto as HIPS sometimes,\n\n144\n00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,400\nyou'll see Host Based Intrusion Detection,\nHost Based Intrusion Prevention.\n\n145\n00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:37,680\nThis is basically you know, IPS or\nIDS that you run on the host itself.\n\n146\n00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,001\nAnd that takes the form of anti-malware,\nantivirus, anti-spam,\n\n147\n00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:44,030\nanti-spyware, pop-up blockers,\n\n148\n00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,970\nsoftware firewalls, these are all things\nthat every modern operating system has.\n\n149\n00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:53,468\nIf you are running Windows, Mac OS,\nLinux, they've all got it, right?\n\n150\n00:07:53,468 --> 00:07:54,768\nWhat are some of the ones?\n\n151\n00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:58,695\nWe've got in, in MAC you've got the.\n\n152\n00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:01,913\nGatekeeper and the,\nthe built in Apple firewall.\n\n153\n00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:04,040\nIn Windows you've got\nthe Windows firewall.\n\n154\n00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,110\nIn Linus you've got IP tables.\n\n155\n00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,870\nSo, you know, you've got these\nbuilt in software firewalls, and\n\n156\n00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,970\nthen on top of that you've got their\nanti-malware and anti-spyware.\n\n157\n00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,360\nLike in Windows you have Windows Defender,\nand\n\n158\n00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,930\nall of these are providing\nintrusion prevention.\n\n159\n00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,870\nWhen they see that virus come in,\n\n160\n00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,750\nwhen they see that inappropriate\nactivity come in, they block it.\n\n161\n00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,950\nEither on the network side or whatever.\n\n162\n00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,630\nSo, HIPS,\n\n163\n00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,550\nthat host based intrusion prevention,\nis incredibly useful on the host side.\n\n164\n00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,300\nIt's useful in your corporate\nenvironment where you might have\n\n165\n00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,260\nreal physical firewall,\nit's useful as a second line of defense.\n\n166\n00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,780\nIf an attacker gets past\nthe physical firewall,\n\n167\n00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,100\nnow your software firewall\nis the second line.\n\n168\n00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,060\nBut where it's really super mega useful,\nmobile devices.\n\n169\n00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,880\nIf somebody has a laptop, when they're in\nyour office they're probably safe, but\n\n170\n00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,320\nwhat about when they're in a hotel?\n\n171\n00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,390\nThey're at a convention center.\n\n172\n00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,730\nThey're home.\n\n173\n00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,760\nAll of a sudden all that protection you\nhave at your home office is gone, and\n\n174\n00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,450\nnow the laptop is exposed.\n\n175\n00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,260\nHaving host based intrusion\nprevention system means\n\n176\n00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,217\nno matter what network they plug into,\nthey'll have anti-virus, anti-spam,\n\n177\n00:09:07,217 --> 00:09:10,750\nanti-spyware running, and\nfiltering and protecting your system.\n\n178\n00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,259\nSo that's really important\nin mobile host environments.\n\n179\n00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:14,960\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n180\n00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,530\nYeah, well you know, well having all this\nanti-malware, anti stuff on your machine,\n\n181\n00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,685\nit won't really do a lot of good unless\nyou do practice that patch management.\n\n182\n00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:25,480\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Keeping the OS up to date,\n\n183\n00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,940\nkeeping those definitions up to date and\neven if, you know, you've,\n\n184\n00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,190\nyou've got it and everything's all,\nall said and done, if it's all\n\n185\n00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:37,240\nold stuff then it may not do, do very good\nagainst some of the newer threats out.\n\n186\n00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,130\n>> Yeah.\n\n187\n00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,000\nAbsolutely.\n\n188\n00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,440\nNow in a smaller medium business,\n\n189\n00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,600\nrunning something like a trusted\nOS is not very likely, right?\n\n190\n00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,496\nLike here, here at, at IT Pro TV,\nwe're all admins here.\n\n191\n00:09:48,496 --> 00:09:51,439\nI think every one of us counts as a power\nuser on our system, so we run all sorts of\n\n192\n00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:54,896\ncrazy software much of which, probably,\nhasn't been under a good security review.\n\n193\n00:09:54,896 --> 00:09:57,906\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, if we were to run a trusted OS,\n\n194\n00:09:57,906 --> 00:10:01,130\nhalf the software I run on my own\nlaptop probably wouldn't work.\n\n195\n00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,800\nIt, well, hell, all the-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n196\n00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,359\n>> Adobe stuff would stop working.\n\n197\n00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:07,250\n[LAUGH] So, I've got Adobe AIR installed.\n\n198\n00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,580\nThe, anyhow, it doesn't matter.\n\n199\n00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,910\nSo, so, that may not be an option.\n\n200\n00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,030\nSo, instead,\nyou might take a different standpoint.\n\n201\n00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,860\nA standpoint of saying,\n\n202\n00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,610\nall right, I know my software's\nnot gonna be digitally signed.\n\n203\n00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,520\nI know that it can't be, you know,\n\n204\n00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,700\nupheld to that level but, what I'm gonna\ndo is whitelist and blacklist software.\n\n205\n00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,970\nWe've created our own list, and\n\n206\n00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,240\nsaid these programs are allowed to run,\neverything else is blocked.\n\n207\n00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,560\nOr, you know,\nhowever you wanna do those restrictions.\n\n208\n00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,860\nThat can be handy cuz sure the software\nmight not be digitally signed, but\n\n209\n00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,730\nat least you can review it to determine\nwhether it came from a trusted source,\n\n210\n00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,250\nand choose from there\nwhether you want to run it.\n\n211\n00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,320\nYou know, we use a lot of obscure software\nhere, some of which is digitally signed,\n\n212\n00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,010\nsome of which is, is not.\n\n213\n00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,090\nYou know,\nit's software written by a third party,\n\n214\n00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,850\nusually like an individual developer\nwho just doesn't have the funds and\n\n215\n00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,390\nthe backing to be able to go and\nget this software authorized by Microsoft,\n\n216\n00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,140\nor whoever, for, for use in a,\nin a large scale environment.\n\n217\n00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,810\nAll right, some of the other\nthings we needed to think about\n\n218\n00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:10,180\nsometimes software solutions only\nmeet half of our needs, okay?\n\n219\n00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,790\nIf we have equipment deployed in\na public area, right, like in a school,\n\n220\n00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,760\nwhere sure you've got your staff but then\nyou've got all these kids, the parents,\n\n221\n00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,150\nother people that are coming in and\nout of the building.\n\n222\n00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,060\nEquipment can walk away.\n\n223\n00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,372\nSo, physical security,\nhardware security, right?\n\n224\n00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:27,110\nHaving cable locks, safes,\n\n225\n00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,090\nlocking cabinets,\nthose are things not to be overlooked.\n\n226\n00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,960\nIn the scenario of having a public\nenvironment where you don't control who\n\n227\n00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,410\nhas access to the facility, you've got to\nimplement hardware security, all right?\n\n228\n00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,450\nI used to work in a bank.\n\n229\n00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,470\nAnd at the bank we all had equipment\nthat had sensitive data on it.\n\n230\n00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,740\nYou know, financial information.\n\n231\n00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,630\nIt was on there.\n\n232\n00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,076\nEven, even someone like\nme where I was the,\n\n233\n00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:55,100\nthe network manager, if I ran a sniffer\nand captured some sniffer logs,\n\n234\n00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,950\nI didn't necessarily know\nwhat all data was in there.\n\n235\n00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,520\nIt was possible that I had\nfinancial transactions in there.\n\n236\n00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,570\nSo, if someone were to steal my laptop,\nthat would be a big deal.\n\n237\n00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:06,570\nWell, I didn't worry about it so much\nwhen I would leave my laptop at work, and\n\n238\n00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:11,290\nthen we found out that they were doing\nsome like mortgage training courses for\n\n239\n00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,730\nfirst time home buyers in the facility.\n\n240\n00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:18,920\nAnd so at night, after we all went home,\nthere were customers coming in.\n\n241\n00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,080\nComing into our facility,\ngoing into our training center and,\n\n242\n00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,290\nand learning a course.\n\n243\n00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,310\nNow, they were supervised, but\n\n244\n00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,030\nthe possibility was there that one\nof these non-employees could have\n\n245\n00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,670\ngone into one of the unauthorized rooms,\nfollowed a cleaning crew member in or\n\n246\n00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,590\nsomething like that, and\ngained access to one of those devices.\n\n247\n00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:37,650\nSo, we had a standing rule that said,\nwhen you leave,\n\n248\n00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,430\neither you take your laptop with you or\nyou lock it in your desk.\n\n249\n00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,600\nThat was a requirement,\nyou had to lock it in the desk.\n\n250\n00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,440\nAnd as long as you did that you were fine,\npeople wouldn't be able to get at it.\n\n251\n00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,110\nSo, it, it just goes back\nto that idea of whether or\n\n252\n00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,800\nnot you can control physical\naccesses to your equipment.\n\n253\n00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,620\nDon't forget hardware security.\n\n254\n00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,755\n>> Yeah.\nYou know Don I,\n\n255\n00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:58,910\nI did a quick little Google search for\nsome of those cable locks,\n\n256\n00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:02,770\nthose Kingsinton locks, and so\nI put up some examples here.\n\n257\n00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,180\nYou know, on some of these mobile\ndevices they will have a, a little,\n\n258\n00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:10,070\nsmall cutout inside of the,\nthe laptop, or what have you,\n\n259\n00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,170\nwhere some of these locks will then,\nwill go in, in there and lock itself down.\n\n260\n00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,770\nAnd so that remains tethered to the,\nthe desk or what have you.\n\n261\n00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,546\n>> Yep.\n\n262\n00:13:18,546 --> 00:13:21,640\nYeah and that's that's pretty sta- you\nknow, Kensington is a company, but\n\n263\n00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,070\ntheir little lock adapter has\nbeen pretty generally accepted.\n\n264\n00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,560\nSo you see a lot of equipment with that,\n\n265\n00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,470\nand that'll stop somebody from just\nsnagging that device and walking.\n\n266\n00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,160\nAnd in your picture they show laptops,\nbut they make them for monitors and\n\n267\n00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,320\nother things, too.\n\n268\n00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,370\nThey also make ones where you actually\nlike bolt them on or epoxy them on, but\n\n269\n00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,330\nthose aren't as strong.\n\n270\n00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,195\nIt's better to have the,\nthe lock built in.\n\n271\n00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:40,900\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n272\n00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,610\n>> All right,\nsome of the other things to think about,\n\n273\n00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,290\nthings like host software baselining.\n\n274\n00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,750\nAll right, this is a nice one.\n\n275\n00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,350\nIf you're not gonna whitelist and\nblacklist software,\n\n276\n00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,940\nat least keep track of what\nsoftware is installed, and\n\n277\n00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,090\nthere's a number of products out there,\nlike System Center Configuration Manager,\n\n278\n00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:01,560\nand stuff like that, that can inventory\nthe software installed on a machine.\n\n279\n00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,670\nAnd you can use that as a baseline to say,\nall right,\n\n280\n00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,910\nhere's the software that\nshould be installed.\n\n281\n00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:10,225\nAnd if somebody installs other software,\nyou run that inventory again and\n\n282\n00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,550\nyou'll see what's been\nadded that's different.\n\n283\n00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,900\nAnd you can use that to keep track\nof what software is installed,\n\n284\n00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,750\nwhat should be there,\nwhat shouldn't be there, and\n\n285\n00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,250\nsee when people are running\nunauthorized software, or\n\n286\n00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,500\nat least find out about new software that\nyou need to add to your approved list.\n\n287\n00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,050\n>> Mm hm.\n\n288\n00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:26,940\n>> All right.\n\n289\n00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,070\nAnd then the last entry here\nthey had is virtualization.\n\n290\n00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,910\nVirtualization is kind of a tricky one.\n\n291\n00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,580\nAll right?\n\n292\n00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,415\nAnd what we're, remember what\nwe're talking about here are the,\n\n293\n00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:37,900\nthe scenarios where we deal with this,\nokay?\n\n294\n00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,110\nI use a ton of virtualization\non my laptop, right?\n\n295\n00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,390\nSo I, I've got a, I've got a Mac, and\nI've got it set up for boot camp,\n\n296\n00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:48,040\nwhere I can boot into Mac OS or\nWindows, right?\n\n297\n00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,320\nAnd they both run off of hardware.\n\n298\n00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,550\nSo that's not virtualization.\n\n299\n00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,480\nI just do a boot, all right?\n\n300\n00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,790\nIf I boot into Mac OS,\nI then have VMware Fusion,\n\n301\n00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,200\nwhere I can fire up my\nvirtual machines there.\n\n302\n00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,800\nIf I boot into Windows, I've got virtual\nbox, where I can fire up my VMs there.\n\n303\n00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,710\nRight?\nSo, I've got two physical machines where\n\n304\n00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,350\nonly one can be on at a given time,\n\n305\n00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,920\nand then inside of that I've\ngot numerous virtual machines.\n\n306\n00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,435\nWell those virtual\nmachines are turned off.\n\n307\n00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:13,975\nAre they gonna update?\n\n308\n00:15:13,975 --> 00:15:15,415\nAre they gonna get patches?\n\n309\n00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,405\nAre they gonna get virus updates?\n\n310\n00:15:17,405 --> 00:15:18,825\nIt's not while they're off.\n\n311\n00:15:18,825 --> 00:15:21,605\nSo, here I am in the office and\nthose machines are off,\n\n312\n00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:22,925\nthey're not getting updated.\n\n313\n00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:26,345\nWhen I go home I might fire them up and\nthey don't have their policies,\n\n314\n00:15:26,345 --> 00:15:27,815\nthey don't have their configuration.\n\n315\n00:15:27,815 --> 00:15:30,725\nThey don't have that stuff that we push\nmore in corporate environment cuz they\n\n316\n00:15:30,725 --> 00:15:31,733\nweren't on here at the office.\n\n317\n00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:33,398\nAll right?\n\n318\n00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:37,310\nSo because of that, you may wanna block\nvirtualization in your environment.\n\n319\n00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,220\nYou may wanna say virtualization is\nnot allowed unless authorized and\n\n320\n00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,700\nmanaged by the IT department, or something\nlike that because you need to have\n\n321\n00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,132\ncontrol over those virtual machines too\nand that can be really really tricky.\n\n322\n00:15:48,132 --> 00:15:49,909\nAll right.\n\n323\n00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:53,428\nSo just keep that in mind you\nknow patch compatibility,\n\n324\n00:15:53,428 --> 00:15:56,567\nhost availability all\nthese stuff really does.\n\n325\n00:15:56,567 --> 00:15:58,253\nKind of change behavior.\n\n326\n00:15:58,253 --> 00:16:01,670\nNow, on the server side,\nthis is good stuff, right?\n\n327\n00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,080\nOn the server side, the virtualization\nis gonna provide you that redundancy and\n\n328\n00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,000\nfailover, the better efficient\nuse of your hardware, right,\n\n329\n00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,045\nwe wanna embrace it there, but on the\ndesktop side it can be really challenging,\n\n330\n00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:16,245\nso we have to be careful, all right.\n\n331\n00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:18,675\nThere are some neat new\nscenarios coming down the line,\n\n332\n00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:23,065\nlike Citrix has been working on\na product called Zen Client, and\n\n333\n00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:29,065\nthe idea is your laptop will have two\noperating systems, a personal and a work.\n\n334\n00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:31,065\nThat you can switch between\nwith the push of a button,\n\n335\n00:16:31,065 --> 00:16:34,250\njust quickly flip between them,\nlive while it's running.\n\n336\n00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,660\nSo that you do all your personal stuff\non this non-secured personal VM and\n\n337\n00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,810\nthen you push a button and it just flips\nover to the work one, and now you've got\n\n338\n00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:46,320\na secured restricted encrypted system,\nand you're able to do your work\n\n339\n00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,280\nactivities without risk of you know,\nbleeding data over to that personal side.\n\n340\n00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,290\nSo you have your Facebook one side\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n341\n00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,390\n>> But then you've got your line of\n\n342\n00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,710\nbusiness stuff on the other.\n\n343\n00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:58,019\nSo that's leveraging virtualization for\neven better security.\n\n344\n00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,574\n>> Huh.\n\n345\n00:16:59,574 --> 00:17:03,770\nSo, those are the main scenarios we need\nto be aware of, just remember, I mean,\n\n346\n00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:08,060\nyou can make use of all of this stuff if\nyou want, but it's not always appropriate.\n\n347\n00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,070\nLike a trusted OS is not\nsomething that a small business or\n\n348\n00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,870\na home user is going to need, but,\n\n349\n00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:17,546\nyou might still make use of things like\nhardware security even as a home-user.\n\n350\n00:17:17,546 --> 00:17:20,180\nVersus a business-user who will\nactually probably need most of these.\n\n351\n00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,570\nAll right so, that's the main thing we\nneed to remember with host security.\n\n352\n00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,350\nNow there is more.\n\n353\n00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,300\nWe've got quite a bit more.\n\n354\n00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,360\nWhen we deal with hosts,\n\n355\n00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,020\none of our biggest risks is losing\nthe data that's on the host.\n\n356\n00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,150\nOn a server, that may or\nmay not be a big deal.\n\n357\n00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,690\nFor example, if I have a web server or\nlet's take IT Pro TV.\n\n358\n00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,030\nSo IT Pro TV we have a web server,\nthat you guys are probably at right now,\n\n359\n00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:47,890\nlooking at the web page.\n\n360\n00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:52,380\nWell If you are on our website,\nyou are hitting our web server,\n\n361\n00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:57,880\nthere is no sensitive data on that web\nserver, if a hacker were to get in and\n\n362\n00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,050\nharvest all the data off of\nthat web server, it's fine.\n\n363\n00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,360\nThere aren't even user names and\npasswords on there, nothing,\n\n364\n00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,560\njust webpages, they could take our\nsite offline, that would suck.\n\n365\n00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,450\nBut it wouldn't compromise any data,\nall right.\n\n366\n00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,960\nBut then behind that\nthere's a data base server.\n\n367\n00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,490\nAnd the data base server,\nthat's a different story, right.\n\n368\n00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,350\nIn the data base server, there are user\nnames and encrypted passwords, right.\n\n369\n00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,190\nAnd their encrypted, that's good.\n\n370\n00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,260\nBut it's still, you know, still there.\n\n371\n00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,840\nSo, if an attacker were to get in,\nthey could, at a minimum,\n\n372\n00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,870\nget user names and email addresses.\n\n373\n00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,970\nRight.\nWe wouldn't want your email\n\n374\n00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:33,860\naddresses to leak out.\n\n375\n00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,480\nSo, granted,\nit's not the end of the world.\n\n376\n00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,410\nIt's not like using your\nSocial Security number.\n\n377\n00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,270\nBut it's still not something\nyou want to have happen.\n\n378\n00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:45,100\nSo, the web server, I'm not necessarily\nworrying about encrypting and\n\n379\n00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,890\nsecuring and all that.\n\n380\n00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,900\nBut the database server I am.\n\n381\n00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,500\nIf somebody got to that,\nit would be a big deal.\n\n382\n00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,790\nWell, when we talk about securing data,\nwe need to be aware\n\n383\n00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:00,050\nthat there's actually three places\nwe need to secure that data, right?\n\n384\n00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,930\nAnd do they call it out, yeah they\ncall it out in the objectives here.\n\n385\n00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:06,510\nData in transit,\ndata at rest, data in use.\n\n386\n00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,070\nAll right.\nThese are like the three states of data,\n\n387\n00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,740\nit's kinda like the three states\nof matter, you've got gas, liquid,\n\n388\n00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,039\nsolid, right [LAUGH] that's how data is.\n\n389\n00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:14,631\nData at rest.\n\n390\n00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:18,419\nThat's when we normally think, or what I\nnormally think of when I think of data.\n\n391\n00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,846\nThere's data just sitting\nthere on my hard drive.\n\n392\n00:19:20,846 --> 00:19:22,950\nData at rest, okay.\n\n393\n00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,320\nData just sitting there on my hard drive.\n\n394\n00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,990\nWell, if somebody steals my hard drive,\nrips it out of the computer,\n\n395\n00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:32,670\ntakes it home and sticks it in their\ncomputer, can they get at that data?\n\n396\n00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,360\nNormally, yes.\n\n397\n00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,260\nSo I need to take precautions\nto make sure they can't do that.\n\n398\n00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,100\nData in transit,\n\n399\n00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,320\nthat's when I'm moving data from my\ncomputer to someone else's computer.\n\n400\n00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,420\nAll right, when it's crossing the network.\n\n401\n00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,420\nCould somebody intercept that data?\n\n402\n00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,220\nYes.\n\n403\n00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,230\nSo I need to take\nmeasures to protect that.\n\n404\n00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,180\nAnd then data in use.\n\n405\n00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,660\nThe data's on the hard drive,\nbut now I'm accessing it.\n\n406\n00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,390\nI'm starting to work with it.\n\n407\n00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,610\nSo the data's copied from\nthe hard drive to RAM.\n\n408\n00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,520\nAnd now it's in RAM and\nI'm working with it there.\n\n409\n00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,290\nCan somebody compromise that?\n\n410\n00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,390\nWell just ask Target.\n\n411\n00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,230\nThat's how the credit skimmers\nworked with the Target attack.\n\n412\n00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,820\nYes, they can access that.\n\n413\n00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,890\nSo now I need to take precautions\nto secure that, all right?\n\n414\n00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,470\nNow why the big distinction\nbetween the three places?\n\n415\n00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,700\nWell there's different ways of\nsecuring data, in all three places.\n\n416\n00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,660\nAnd they are all three important, if you\njust do one, you are still susceptible for\n\n417\n00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,520\nlosing your data at the other points,\nall right.\n\n418\n00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,550\nLet me give you an example,\nyou go to amazon.com.\n\n419\n00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:39,080\nAnd you do a search for\nX Files season three on DVD.\n\n420\n00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,750\nRight?\n\n421\n00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,180\nI can sorry there's\nthings I can lie about.\n\n422\n00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,560\nSo you do a search for the X Files DVD and\nyou find it and you're ready to buy it.\n\n423\n00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,300\nSo you add it to your cart and\nyou hit checkout now.\n\n424\n00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,570\nAnd Amazon flips you over to\na secure connection, all right.\n\n425\n00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,460\nNow you're using SSL.\n\n426\n00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,160\nYour little lock appears\nup in the address bar.\n\n427\n00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,620\nSo you're like oh this session is secure,\nawesome.\n\n428\n00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,390\nOkay?\n\n429\n00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:03,520\nYou go, and you buy that DVD, and you wait\nfor it to ship, so you can show up and,\n\n430\n00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,785\nand watch all the Fox and\nScully you can, right?\n\n431\n00:21:05,785 --> 00:21:06,510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now,\n\n432\n00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,400\nthat was a secure communication, right?\n\n433\n00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,370\nNobody could possibly get at your data.\n\n434\n00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,790\nWell, that's not entirely true.\n\n435\n00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:19,200\nSSL provides security for data in transit.\n\n436\n00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,390\nThe data that move between your computer,\nand\n\n437\n00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:26,980\nAmazon's computer, while it was on\nthe network, was encrypted, was protected.\n\n438\n00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,992\nYou were secured, SSL did that, all right.\n\n439\n00:21:30,992 --> 00:21:33,960\nBut, what about the data on your computer?\n\n440\n00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,300\nWhen you went to that webpage,\na copy of that webpage was cached in your\n\n441\n00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,350\ntemporary internet files,\nyour cache, right?\n\n442\n00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,940\nYour screen, if someone was\nrunning a screen recorder, or\n\n443\n00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,980\na key logger,\nthey could've looked at that data.\n\n444\n00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,470\nThat's not data in transit,\nthat's data on your system.\n\n445\n00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,650\nYour system could have been compromised.\n\n446\n00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,070\nThe network was secure,\ndata in transit, but\n\n447\n00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,630\ndata in use, data on your machine, wasn't.\n\n448\n00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,130\nAll right.\n\n449\n00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,700\nSame thing at Amazon.\n\n450\n00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,300\nThey receive your order.\n\n451\n00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,040\nRight?\nThe data's in transit,\n\n452\n00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,220\nit comes over to their system.\n\n453\n00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,590\nThen, they have to store it.\n\n454\n00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,440\nDon't they?\n\n455\n00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,450\nThey have to take that credit\ncard data and run it, and\n\n456\n00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,890\nstore it in their database, data at rest.\n\n457\n00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,570\nRight?\n\n458\n00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:18,720\nAnd that, if they get broken into and\nsomebody accesses their database,\n\n459\n00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,140\nthey can get at that data.\n\n460\n00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,380\nSo, SSL is really just\nsecuring data in transit.\n\n461\n00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,080\nAnd that's true of VPNs, IPsec, right?\n\n462\n00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,970\nAny type of network security,\n\n463\n00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:35,200\nSSH that's all data in transit\nthat you're protecting,bright?\n\n464\n00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,140\nData at rest, that's if somebody, you\nknow, physically compromises my machine.\n\n465\n00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,330\nAnd that's where we need technologies\nlike TrueCrypt or BitLocker, or\n\n466\n00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,590\neven something that provides\nwhole disk encryption, right?\n\n467\n00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:51,840\nSo we've got data encryption up here,\nfull disk, your database,\n\n468\n00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,350\nindividual files, these things, that's why\nwe're encrypting data on the hard drive.\n\n469\n00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,000\nIf somebody rips that hard drive out and\n\n470\n00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,540\nsticks it in their own computer,\nthey just see a bunch of encrypted stuff.\n\n471\n00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,100\nRight?\n\n472\n00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,740\nThat is secured.\n\n473\n00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,920\nIt's data at rest.\n\n474\n00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,760\nBut, does that mean that's all I\nneed to do and my data is safe?\n\n475\n00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,450\nNow just ask the guy who just\ngot arrested from Silk Road,\n\n476\n00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,100\nhe can tell you all about that.\n\n477\n00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,170\nHis laptop was fully encrypted.\n\n478\n00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,280\nHe had a fully encrypted laptop,\nI think he was using Trucrypt they said,\n\n479\n00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,660\nI don't know how true that is.\n\n480\n00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,350\nIt is true.\n\n481\n00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,860\nSo anyway it was an encrypted\nhard drive nonetheless.\n\n482\n00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:32,050\nso had his hard drive encrypted so\nhis data was safe.\n\n483\n00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:36,025\nWell, what happened is,\nhe went to a public library, right,\n\n484\n00:23:36,025 --> 00:23:40,150\nand he was using a public library\nas his communication point, and\n\n485\n00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,406\nthe FBI was waiting in the library.\n\n486\n00:23:42,406 --> 00:23:46,146\nHe sat down, he logged in,\nhe punched in his encryption key, and\n\n487\n00:23:46,146 --> 00:23:47,308\nhe started to work.\n\n488\n00:23:47,308 --> 00:23:49,943\nNow when you encrypt data on\nthe hard drive, it's encrypted.\n\n489\n00:23:49,943 --> 00:23:54,752\nBut when you access the data- It's copied\nto RAM, and your encryption key is used to\n\n490\n00:23:54,752 --> 00:23:58,610\ndecrypt it, so it's decrypted\nin RAM while you work with it.\n\n491\n00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,280\nAnd then when you write it to the hard\ndrive, it's encrypted again and\n\n492\n00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,120\nthen written to the hard drive.\n\n493\n00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,100\nSo it's always encrypted on the hard\ndrive, but in RAM it's not.\n\n494\n00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,720\nAnd they waited until he logged into his\nlaptop, and they jumped out and got him,\n\n495\n00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,820\nyou know, like a, I don't know,\nmagic, magic show.\n\n496\n00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,400\nRight, so they [LAUGH] jumped\nout of the books, right.\n\n497\n00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,130\nThey were actually in between the pages.\n\n498\n00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,580\nAnd they grabbed them and\nthey grabbed the laptop.\n\n499\n00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,950\nThe laptop was on,\nthe encryption keys were in RAM.\n\n500\n00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,860\nAnd what was in RAM was\nunencrypted already,\n\n501\n00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,600\nso they had full access to his laptop\nnow even though the drive was encrypted.\n\n502\n00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,450\nThat hard drive encryption\ngave the Silk Road operator,\n\n503\n00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:38,450\ngave him data at rest protection but\nnot data in use.\n\n504\n00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:42,520\nAnd then the FBI was able to take\na full image of that hard drive\n\n505\n00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,920\nunencrypted, right?\n\n506\n00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,000\nAnd, and that's what they did is they,\nthey grabbed that image of that disk.\n\n507\n00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,700\nSo now they had all the access.\n\n508\n00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,970\nThis is where they got all those crazy\nBitcoins and all that stuff that,\n\n509\n00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,880\nyou know,\njust blew it right out of the water.\n\n510\n00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,000\nSo if you concoct a solution\nthat only does one or\n\n511\n00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,360\nonly does two of these things,\nyou're putting yourself at risk, right?\n\n512\n00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,410\nWe need to make sure that\nwe protect data at rest,\n\n513\n00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,450\nthe data stored on our hard drive, right?\n\n514\n00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,690\nData in transit,\nthe data across the network.\n\n515\n00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,670\nAnd data in use, data in RAM, right?\n\n516\n00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,540\nAnd data in RAM, just.\n\n517\n00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,280\nTarget.\n\n518\n00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,930\nTarget, the cash registers,\n\n519\n00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,880\nthe point-of-sale systems,\nhad a memory scraper running.\n\n520\n00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,800\nAnd it was just watching RAM.\n\n521\n00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,625\nAnd every time a credit card number\npassed through RAM, it would see it and\n\n522\n00:25:27,625 --> 00:25:29,390\nit would capture it, and\na PIN number and a user.\n\n523\n00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,920\nI think it was actually dumping all\nthe data and they were scraping it later.\n\n524\n00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,690\nBut it was gathering that\ndata right out of RAM.\n\n525\n00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:36,810\nWell, the drives could\nhave been encrypted,\n\n526\n00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,444\nthe network could have been encrypted,\nbut in RAM it wasn't.\n\n527\n00:25:39,444 --> 00:25:42,550\nSo it was able to get that data and\nthen export it somehow.\n\n528\n00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,660\nI don't know that they ever revealed\nhow the data was being exported,\n\n529\n00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,580\nbut it certainly was.\n\n530\n00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,550\nSo that's some of the big\nconcerns that we have there.\n\n531\n00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,640\nSo if we're going to be\nimplementing security controls,\n\n532\n00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,440\nwe need to think about all\nthree of those things.\n\n533\n00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,832\nData in transit,\ndata at rest, data in use.\n\n534\n00:25:57,832 --> 00:25:59,860\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n535\n00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,498\n>> All right, now,\nI mentioned hard drive encryption.\n\n536\n00:26:01,498 --> 00:26:03,603\nLet's just run over some of these\nother terms here to make sure we're\n\n537\n00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,710\nfamiliar with them all.\n\n538\n00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,750\nWhen you do hard drive, or\nfull disk encryption, any kind of\n\n539\n00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:12,120\nhardware encryption, there's various\nhardware that can help us, all right?\n\n540\n00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,260\nA TPM is probably one of the most common,\nthat's Trusted Platform Module.\n\n541\n00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,140\nIt's a special chip that's\non your motherboard,\n\n542\n00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,980\nand it's designed to store private keys,\nall right.\n\n543\n00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,750\nSo if you encrypt your hard drive,\nyour key can be stored there in the TPM.\n\n544\n00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,060\nNow, you might ask yourself,\n\n545\n00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,020\nhow secure is that if the key\nis right there with the drive?\n\n546\n00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,520\nSomebody steals the whole laptop,\ndon't they have my private key?\n\n547\n00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:39,060\nWell, the TPM stores the private key,\nbut by itself it's not good enough.\n\n548\n00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,220\nYou still have to provide your\nauthentication credentials.\n\n549\n00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:46,810\nSo when you log in, that combined with\nthe TPM is what unlocks that drive.\n\n550\n00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:50,143\nIf they don't have your login credentials\nthe private key doesn't do them any good.\n\n551\n00:26:50,143 --> 00:26:53,458\nAnd if they take the hard drive out and\nmove it to another system, now they don't\n\n552\n00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:57,290\nhave login credentials and they don't\nhave the TPM, and so it still won't work.\n\n553\n00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:00,410\nSo it does provide that level of security\nwithout us having to remember a crazy\n\n554\n00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,000\nlong key.\n\n555\n00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,050\nAll right.\n\n556\n00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:06,460\nWe've got other things like HSM,\na hardware security module.\n\n557\n00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,460\nThese can take a number\nof different forms.\n\n558\n00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,280\nThey're generally used for\nkey generation, but you can see these in,\n\n559\n00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,190\nin firewalls a lot, where they'll have,\nlike, VPN accelerators, and, and\n\n560\n00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,260\nanything that's designed to,\nenhance the processing of encryption and\n\n561\n00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,700\ndecryption through key generation.\n\n562\n00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,960\nThere's SSL offload boards.\n\n563\n00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,789\nLet me see if I can find\nan example of that real quick.\n\n564\n00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,727\nHm.\n>> Yeah, Don, and you know, while,\n\n565\n00:27:28,727 --> 00:27:32,130\nwhile you're looking that up, you know,\nwith TPM, generally if their hardware\n\n566\n00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,700\ndoesn't come with a TPM,\nyou're pretty much out of luck.\n\n567\n00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,740\nNow there are some similar motherboards\nout there that do have TPM headers\n\n568\n00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,938\nwhere you can add the,\nthe device in later.\n\n569\n00:27:41,938 --> 00:27:46,130\nBut you know, with these hard, hardware\nsecurity modules, let's say you have some\n\n570\n00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:50,300\nolder legacy hardware that you, you\nneed to support this kind of technology.\n\n571\n00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,380\nWell, that's where these guys step in,\nwhere you can still implement some\n\n572\n00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:58,170\nupdated cryptographic standards in\nstuff on older legacy hardware.\n\n573\n00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,850\n>> Yeah, yeah, and you know,\nif you're running a massive website,\n\n574\n00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:06,370\nlike if you're running Amazon.com,\nwhere you've got millions of customers\n\n575\n00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:11,240\nall in there trying to do SSL connections,\nthat'll overwhelm a server.\n\n576\n00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,480\nYou know,\nyour servers just can't keep up with that.\n\n577\n00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,300\nSo companies make these SSL accelerators,\nwhich are hardware chips specifically\n\n578\n00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,780\ndesigned for\ngenerating those public-private key pairs\n\n579\n00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,400\nto be able to do the encryption and\ndecryption, and so here's an example.\n\n580\n00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,344\nThey they're, they're kind of small.\n\n581\n00:28:27,344 --> 00:28:29,150\nSometimes they're small.\nSometimes they're big.\n\n582\n00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,380\nBut no matter what they are,\nthey're expensive.\n\n583\n00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,256\nOh, this one's rated for\nWindows 2000, so that's good to know.\n\n584\n00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:37,537\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So if it were 14 years ago,\n\n585\n00:28:37,537 --> 00:28:39,399\nthis one would be awesome.\n\n586\n00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:40,802\nAll right, well,\nthat doesn't help us much.\n\n587\n00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,766\nBut, but it shows you an example,\nright, so\n\n588\n00:28:42,766 --> 00:28:44,940\nthat, that's kinda how these things work.\n\n589\n00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,570\nSo, you know, the big web providers that\nare out there, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft.\n\n590\n00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,390\nWell, maybe not Microsoft.\n\n591\n00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:54,250\nThey really don't get that\nmuch traffic on their site.\n\n592\n00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:54,920\nBut [LAUGH] yeah, I know.\n\n593\n00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,320\nBut, but sites that are moving\na ton of data via SSL,\n\n594\n00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,450\nthey're going to use these accelerators,\nthese HSMs.\n\n595\n00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,740\nAll right, what,\nwhat else do we have in here?\n\n596\n00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,180\nWe've got USB encryption.\n\n597\n00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,390\nThat's a big one.\n\n598\n00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:09,020\nBecause it, a lot of us use\nUSB storage these days, and\n\n599\n00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,900\nyou might have your hard drive\nin your laptop encrypted.\n\n600\n00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,050\nBut not your USB storage, right?\n\n601\n00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,540\nAnd you might,\nmight not even think about it.\n\n602\n00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,164\nNow, you've got this device that's very\neasy to lose because it's removable and\n\n603\n00:29:19,164 --> 00:29:20,987\nit's got data on it that's not secured.\n\n604\n00:29:20,987 --> 00:29:21,533\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n605\n00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:25,514\nYeah, you know, we can use things like a,\na group policy things that we can use.\n\n606\n00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:30,008\nLet's say, you know, depending on\nwhatever our company policies are, and\n\n607\n00:29:30,008 --> 00:29:34,017\nwe can force, more or less,\nour users to adapt to encrypt these USB or\n\n608\n00:29:34,017 --> 00:29:37,357\nUSB drives through, you know,\nthrough a group policy.\n\n609\n00:29:37,357 --> 00:29:40,319\nMake sure that, you know, our users\nthat do bring these drives in and\n\n610\n00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:43,029\nare transferring data and\nwhat-have-you to these devices,\n\n611\n00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:45,124\nthat they are leaving our\nfacility encrypted and\n\n612\n00:29:45,124 --> 00:29:48,270\nprotecting whatever it is that they\nare pulling off one of these drives.\n\n613\n00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:52,000\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, and that,\nthat is, it's pretty important.\n\n614\n00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,820\nAnd, you know, if you,\nif you combine USB storage,\n\n615\n00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,860\nwell, you,\nyou can outright block USB storage.\n\n616\n00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,480\nJust say forget it,\nwe're not gonna support it.\n\n617\n00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,330\nThere's plenty of places that do that.\n\n618\n00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,440\nOr you can say all right, we're gonna\ndo it, but we require encryption.\n\n619\n00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,540\nAnd you can do it through BitLocker.\n\n620\n00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,600\nThat's pretty easy.\n\n621\n00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,050\nOr you can buy the,\nthe hardware USB tokens that, or the, or\n\n622\n00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:13,360\nthe USB keys where they actually have\nhardware encryption built into them.\n\n623\n00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,810\nThere's all sorts of solutions there.\n\n624\n00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,330\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n625\n00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:17,500\n>> And then hard drives.\n\n626\n00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,620\nWell, we've kind of already mentioned hard\ndrives with, like, full disk encryption,\n\n627\n00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,600\nthings like TrueCrypt and BitLocker.\n\n628\n00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,640\nBut they actually do sell hard drives that\nhave hardware encryption modules mounted\n\n629\n00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,550\nright to them, so you can do that.\n\n630\n00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:32,324\nThat helps a bit with performance cuz\nBitLocker, TrueCrypt, they all do their\n\n631\n00:30:32,324 --> 00:30:36,058\nencryption and decryption in software,\nand so it's not the most efficient.\n\n632\n00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:38,502\nBut the hard drives that have\na hardware module on them,\n\n633\n00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:42,410\nthey're actually doing it in hardware so\nyou can get better disk I/O out of them.\n\n634\n00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,220\n>> Hm.\n\n635\n00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:43,720\n>> Right?\n\n636\n00:30:44,782 --> 00:30:46,830\nAll right, we've got a little bit\nmore to talk about here, Nate,\n\n637\n00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,410\nbut this is probably a good\nspot to stop and take a break.\n\n638\n00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,174\nWhat do you think?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n639\n00:30:50,174 --> 00:30:51,002\nYeah, sounds good.\n\n640\n00:30:51,002 --> 00:30:52,470\n>> All right, so let's stop here.\n\n641\n00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,060\nWe'll, we'll take a little break.\n\n642\n00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:57,519\nWhen we get back, we need to talk a bit\nabout data policies and then we're gonna\n\n643\n00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,680\nstart looking at a little more proprietary\nlike factory type environment.\n\n644\n00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,570\nSo stay tuned for that.\n\n645\n00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,138\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n646\n00:31:05,138 --> 00:31:12,555\n[MUSIC]\n\n647\n00:31:12,555 --> 00:31:14,580\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n648\n00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,280\nSo let's take a look at some of the the\nobjectives that we didn't get to in\n\n649\n00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,470\nthe first segment.\n\n650\n00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:22,670\nRemember we were talking about\nimplementing the appropriate security\n\n651\n00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,670\ncontrols for for data security, right.\n\n652\n00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:30,860\nWell, data is really starting to turn up\nin some [LAUGH] weird places these days.\n\n653\n00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,610\nAnd that's what they call out right here\nat the very beginning, cloud storage,\n\n654\n00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,360\nSAN and Big Data, right.\n\n655\n00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,960\nSo let's talk about each of those.\n\n656\n00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,700\nCloud storage.\n\n657\n00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:42,085\nFirst off, my advice is don't use it.\n\n658\n00:31:42,085 --> 00:31:47,061\n[LAUGH] If you have sensitive data, if you\nhave medical records, financial records,\n\n659\n00:31:47,061 --> 00:31:51,364\nanything like that, cloud storage\nis a very challenging thing, right.\n\n660\n00:31:51,364 --> 00:31:55,879\nWith cloud storage, you're relying on a\nthird party to provide you with locations\n\n661\n00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:57,306\nto put your data, right?\n\n662\n00:31:57,306 --> 00:32:03,350\nAnd you are trusting that they conform\nto whatever requirements you have.\n\n663\n00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,960\nAnd you rarely have a chance to audit\nthat yourself to determine whether or\n\n664\n00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,430\nnot they actually conformed to it,\nso it's a real\n\n665\n00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:14,440\nchallenge to use third party data storage,\nand know that it meets your needs.\n\n666\n00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,380\nLet's say that your a bank in\nthe United States of America, well\n\n667\n00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,860\nyour financial records need to be stored\nin a SAS70 compliant data center, right?\n\n668\n00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,470\nWell when you put something\ninto Google Drive,\n\n669\n00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,760\nis their data center SAS70 compliant?\n\n670\n00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,600\nDo you even know where\ntheir data center is?\n\n671\n00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,830\nI don't, right,\nI use Google Drive everyday,\n\n672\n00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,460\nI have no idea where that data is.\n\n673\n00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,720\nSo, it's not an option, it just need\nto be off the table, all right.\n\n674\n00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,390\nHowever, if you don't have\nthat compliance level.\n\n675\n00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,850\nIf you're able to store data there,\nthat doesn't mean you can't use it.\n\n676\n00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,640\nJust don't trust them.\n\n677\n00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,582\nDropbox, very, very visible.\n\n678\n00:32:46,582 --> 00:32:48,838\nThey've been fairly\ntransparent about this.\n\n679\n00:32:48,838 --> 00:32:52,415\nDropbox encrypts your data in transit.\n\n680\n00:32:52,415 --> 00:32:55,882\nDropboxes has also shared their\nprivate keys with the United States\n\n681\n00:32:55,882 --> 00:32:56,450\ngovernment right.\n\n682\n00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,880\nIt's one of the things that\ncame out a few months ago.\n\n683\n00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,190\nSo, if the US government does one of\nthose national security letters or gets\n\n684\n00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:06,447\na warrant or whatever, they can access\nany of your data stored on Dropbox right.\n\n685\n00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,350\nThere's the argument that if\nyou're not doing anything illegal,\n\n686\n00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,750\nthen what have you got to worry about?\n\n687\n00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,160\nBut at the same time,\nif you have sensitive data and\n\n688\n00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,260\nyou want to know that it's protected, and\nyou want to use Dropbox, which it's not\n\n689\n00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:22,840\nterribly expensive, you need to encrypt\nthe data before sending it to Dropbox.\n\n690\n00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,770\nIf you encrypt it yourself and\nthen send it up to the cloud, so\n\n691\n00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:28,890\nit's stored encrypted.\n\n692\n00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:31,940\nThen it doesn't matter if they have access\nto it or if they share it or whatever.\n\n693\n00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,960\nBecause it's encrypted and\nonly have the keys to decrypt it.\n\n694\n00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,010\nThat's how services like Last-pass work,\nthat's why you can trust Last-pass.\n\n695\n00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:41,140\nBecause you encrypt it yourself,\nbefore sending it to them,\n\n696\n00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,610\nthey don't have the keys.\n\n697\n00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:46,470\nBut Dropbox, when you encrypt with\ntheir system, they have the keys.\n\n698\n00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,120\nThat's how it works.\n\n699\n00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,758\nIt's in their end-user license agreement,\nso that's just how those services work,\n\n700\n00:33:51,758 --> 00:33:56,110\nif you are using Amazon S3,\nWindows Azure storage,\n\n701\n00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,780\nRack Space storage,\nthey all work the same way.\n\n702\n00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,220\nSo you're either trusting\nthem to provide security and\n\n703\n00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:05,400\nfalling under their umbrella, or\nyour providing the security yourself.\n\n704\n00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,930\nNow there's obviously some negatives,\nif you encrypt data and store it up in\n\n705\n00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:13,180\nthe cloud nobody else can access it\neither cuz it's encrypted, right?\n\n706\n00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,920\nSo you kind of lose utility.\n\n707\n00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,850\nNow that doesn't mean don't use it, right,\njust don't use it for sensitive data.\n\n708\n00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,790\nWe use cloud storage for IT PRO TV,\n\n709\n00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:25,860\nin fact, if you're watching any of our\nvideos as the VOD, video on demand,\n\n710\n00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,870\nif you're watching them in reruns,\nthose are coming from cloud storage.\n\n711\n00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:33,260\nMost likely, either coming from Scale\nEngine, one of our streaming providers.\n\n712\n00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,510\nOr Vimeo, or Amazon S3.\n\n713\n00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,680\nThose are the three places\nthat we store our videos, and\n\n714\n00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,430\nall three of them are cloud storage.\n\n715\n00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:45,360\nI have, I have never, I don't even\nknow where Vimeo stores their stuff.\n\n716\n00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,688\nI don't think Amazon allows tours of\ntheir videos, of their data centers,\n\n717\n00:34:48,688 --> 00:34:50,248\nand, Scale Engine is up in Canada,\n\n718\n00:34:50,248 --> 00:34:52,860\nand I don't really know where\ntheir data center is either.\n\n719\n00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,332\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I know they have service set up for\n\n720\n00:34:56,332 --> 00:34:59,896\nus here and in Malaysia,\ncuz we have our Asian customers, and so,\n\n721\n00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:02,850\nwe've got those systems\nare all over the place.\n\n722\n00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,700\nBut, at the end of the day,\n\n723\n00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,350\nif somebody breaks in and steals our\nvideos, that's not a big deal, right?\n\n724\n00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:12,330\nI mean, obviously it would make me sad,\nbut it's not like I lost credit\n\n725\n00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,190\ncard information,\nit's not like I lost user's personal data.\n\n726\n00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,770\nWe just lost our episodes.\n\n727\n00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,530\nOkay, well, I, I can deal with that.\n\n728\n00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:22,050\nAnd so, Cloud storage is suitable for\nthat, you need to assess your data.\n\n729\n00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:25,610\nIf you're gonna use Cloud storage,\nit needs to be data that you wouldn't\n\n730\n00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:30,860\nregret losing all right,\nSAN, a storage area network.\n\n731\n00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:35,070\nSANs are woefully ignored\nwhen it comes to security.\n\n732\n00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:40,174\nWhen you have a storage area network,\nperformance is their primary focus.\n\n733\n00:35:40,174 --> 00:35:44,935\nYou have HBAs, right,\nyour Host Bus Adapters that connect\n\n734\n00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:48,555\nyour servers to the SAN, and then you\nhave the SAN itself where the storage is.\n\n735\n00:35:48,555 --> 00:35:53,495\nAnd it's moving data across, hopefully\na fiber-optic network, as fast as it can.\n\n736\n00:35:53,495 --> 00:35:55,265\nThat's what it does.\n\n737\n00:35:55,265 --> 00:35:56,365\nIt doesn't do encryption.\n\n738\n00:35:56,365 --> 00:35:58,845\nIt doesn't normally do authentication,\nright?\n\n739\n00:35:58,845 --> 00:36:02,170\nMost security on a SAN out\nof the box is turned off.\n\n740\n00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:06,710\nSo if you just hook up a SAN and run\nwith it, it is very insecure, all right.\n\n741\n00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:09,930\nSo what you need to do is go back,\nand secure it.\n\n742\n00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:14,540\nPut on at least CHAP username and password\nauthentication in between your servers and\n\n743\n00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,950\nthe host, you need to do zoning\nwhere you divide up what\n\n744\n00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,080\nhard drives each server is allowed to see.\n\n745\n00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,990\nYou need to implement basic security\npractices, you probably don't\n\n746\n00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:27,830\nwanna do data encryption because it's\ngonna hurt performance on Disk/IO.\n\n747\n00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,680\nAll right?\n\n748\n00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,240\nBut the other types of authentication\ncan be done without impact.\n\n749\n00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,080\nAnd another thing, they make IPS boxes,\n\n750\n00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,650\nintrusion prevention function\nsystems that can run on a SAN.\n\n751\n00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,650\nAll right?\n\n752\n00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:43,729\nCisco, they make the ASA 55, or\nactually they have a, shoot,\n\n753\n00:36:43,729 --> 00:36:46,550\nthere's a dedicated IPS for it now.\n\n754\n00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,750\nLet me see if I can find it real quick.\n\n755\n00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,320\nA Cisco IPS sensor.\n\n756\n00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,930\nThey make one.\n\n757\n00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:55,030\nIt's a high end one, that is\nspecifically designed to be able to\n\n758\n00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,910\nhandle the traffic\nlevels you see on SAM's.\n\n759\n00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,000\nIt's that big guy right there.\n\n760\n00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,910\nDo have like a models?\n\n761\n00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:02,650\nHere we go, the four.\n\n762\n00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:03,715\nWell, no.\nThat's a 4270.\n\n763\n00:37:03,715 --> 00:37:09,082\nI was thinking of the 5580, but yeah, if\nyou look at this guy like this 4270 here.\n\n764\n00:37:09,082 --> 00:37:11,845\nSee where it says up to 4 GB performance?\n\n765\n00:37:11,845 --> 00:37:16,190\nWell, a lot of SAN's that are out there\nare 4 GB, but there's 8 GB ones also.\n\n766\n00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,110\nSo that one is not going to fly,\nwell, here we go.\n\n767\n00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,390\nOffers up to 16 GB interfaces.\n\n768\n00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:23,955\nYeah, this isn't the right one,\nlet me find a 5580.\n\n769\n00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:31,345\nCisco 5580.\n\n770\n00:37:31,345 --> 00:37:33,297\nWell, shoot,\nI get a nice little cartoon picture.\n\n771\n00:37:33,297 --> 00:37:37,364\nBut that's a Cisco 5580, it's\na firewall with an IPS module in it and\n\n772\n00:37:37,364 --> 00:37:41,492\nit's able to scan data at a very, very\nfast rate and be able to do things like\n\n773\n00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:44,800\nintrusion prevention, or\nat least intrusion detection.\n\n774\n00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,130\nAnd you can run those on storage area\nnetwork so you can do scans like that.\n\n775\n00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,610\nSo there are ways to secure\nthose storage area networks.\n\n776\n00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:56,700\nWhat you don't want,\nis a hacker to compromise one server, and\n\n777\n00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,020\nthen through the host bus\nadapter of that server to\n\n778\n00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:03,470\nstart accessing the hard drives of other\nservers without even breaking into them.\n\n779\n00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,748\nRight?\nJust directly accessing the hard drives,\n\n780\n00:38:05,748 --> 00:38:08,670\nthey can get a ton of data\nwithout even leaving a footprint.\n\n781\n00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:13,382\nThat's really, really bad, so you don't\nwant to neglect your storage area network,\n\n782\n00:38:13,382 --> 00:38:13,966\nyour SAN.\n\n783\n00:38:13,966 --> 00:38:14,673\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n784\n00:38:14,673 --> 00:38:19,545\nSo the next speaking of SAN's and\nthose sorts of things, we're starting\n\n785\n00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:24,160\nto leave the realm then, of the kind of\ninformation that we have on our systems.\n\n786\n00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,560\nOr the kind of information that\nwe can keep into our businesses.\n\n787\n00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,525\nAnd then the next step\nthat we have is big data.\n\n788\n00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:31,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right?\n\n789\n00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,670\nSo these are just absolutely enormous\namounts of data that we have, and\n\n790\n00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:39,200\nyou know, and\nspeaking of like of the the SQL database.\n\n791\n00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:39,720\nSQL, right?\n\n792\n00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,990\nWe're at the SQL databases, need no SQL\ndatabases where they're designed for\n\n793\n00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:48,310\nthese massive amounts of,\nof data shared between.\n\n794\n00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:51,279\n>> Yeah, and\nthink about the US Census database,\n\n795\n00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:55,980\nthe Amazon product database,\nyou know these are massive databases.\n\n796\n00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,160\nEven on a smaller scale,\nwell I shouldn't say smaller scale,\n\n797\n00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,520\nit's all big data, right, the Google\nsearch database, how big is that,\n\n798\n00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,250\nwhere they've indexed millions\nupon millions of webpages.\n\n799\n00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:11,150\nOr Gmail, how big is their e-mail\ndatabase, databases right,\n\n800\n00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,560\nthere's gotta be many, many, many of them.\n\n801\n00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,200\nSo, these are massive amounts of data, and\n\n802\n00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:21,310\nwhen you've got data that large,\nit would be really difficult to spot,\n\n803\n00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:24,500\nif one person connected and\nstarted doing a data dump, right?\n\n804\n00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,940\nBecause you've got tons of traffic anyway,\nyou're not gonna see an increase or\n\n805\n00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,080\na spike in bandwidth cuz it's just\ngoing to blend in with all the others.\n\n806\n00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,830\nSo, monitoring that type of access\nbecomes very challenging, and\n\n807\n00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,699\nthe data bases are so large.\n\n808\n00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,702\nThat the database servers themselves,\nlike if you're running Maria DB/s or\n\n809\n00:39:42,702 --> 00:39:47,260\nMongo DB or one of those larger scale\nones, Oracle 10i or something that,\n\n810\n00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:51,608\nif you're running a database server\nof that magnitude you can't really\n\n811\n00:39:51,608 --> 00:39:56,268\nimplement a lot of security on the back\nend with that size of data, all right?\n\n812\n00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,125\nSo what's, what's the solution?\n\n813\n00:39:58,125 --> 00:40:01,546\nWell, don't rely on\nthe database to do security.\n\n814\n00:40:01,546 --> 00:40:05,686\nInstead Put the database behind other\ndevices that are responsible for\n\n815\n00:40:05,686 --> 00:40:06,589\nsecurity use.\n\n816\n00:40:06,589 --> 00:40:11,539\nThings like IPSes, in-line scanners\nthat can look for malicious activity,\n\n817\n00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:16,210\nlook for SQL injection attacks,\nbefore they get to the database server.\n\n818\n00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:20,990\nThat way the database server can focus\non doing what it does best, storing and\n\n819\n00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:25,930\nretrieving data as fast as possible,\nnot scanning for security and\n\n820\n00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:26,820\nthings like that.\n\n821\n00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,990\nUse some other device.\n\n822\n00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:32,392\nEvery database server supports\ndatabase level encryption or\n\n823\n00:40:32,392 --> 00:40:34,920\nevery one that I've worked for\nwith in the last ten years\n\n824\n00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,690\nsupports database encryption, but they\nall hurt for performance when they do it.\n\n825\n00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:44,190\nSo instead, get a SAN that has\nencryption built into it, and let\n\n826\n00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:48,050\nthe SAN take care of the encryption so the\ndatabase server doesn't have to, right?\n\n827\n00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:52,981\nDon't force a large scale database to do\nthings are going to kill its performance,\n\n828\n00:40:52,981 --> 00:40:53,490\nright?\n\n829\n00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:57,510\nThe larger that database,\nthe more performance becomes an issue.\n\n830\n00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:01,870\n>> All right, so we've got our data and\nwe know, you know, where to store them and\n\n831\n00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:06,290\nall that sorta stuff, so now, we need to\nget into the realm of our policies, right?\n\n832\n00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,480\nSo how do we handle this data?\n\n833\n00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,130\nWhat do we do with this data?\n\n834\n00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:11,270\nEspecially, what do we do\nwhen we're done with it?\n\n835\n00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:13,210\n>> Yeah.\n>> And how long do we need to keep it?\n\n836\n00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,660\nAnd those sorts of things, right?\n\n837\n00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,810\n>> Yeah and you know,\nwhen we're actually making use of the data\n\n838\n00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:20,570\nit's really easy to identify what\nneeds to be secured and what doesn't.\n\n839\n00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:23,720\nBut when data starts to get aged,\nwhen it's not really being used so\n\n840\n00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,310\nmuch anymore, what do we do there?\n\n841\n00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,515\nAnd CompTIA breaks it\ndown into four pieces.\n\n842\n00:41:27,515 --> 00:41:30,255\nWe've got wiping, disposing,\nretention, and storage.\n\n843\n00:41:31,395 --> 00:41:35,145\nWhen we're done with our data,\nif our hardware is still good and\n\n844\n00:41:35,145 --> 00:41:37,925\nit's just the data we're done with,\nwe need to wipe it, right?\n\n845\n00:41:37,925 --> 00:41:39,675\nWe just need to erase that data.\n\n846\n00:41:39,675 --> 00:41:42,895\nAnd when you do that,\nwell, how do you do it?\n\n847\n00:41:42,895 --> 00:41:44,253\nHow do you go about wiping that data?\n\n848\n00:41:44,253 --> 00:41:46,183\nAnd there's many different ways, but\n\n849\n00:41:46,183 --> 00:41:48,705\njust deleting the data is not good enough,\nright?\n\n850\n00:41:48,705 --> 00:41:49,855\nData can be recovered.\n\n851\n00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:54,590\nThe only way to be sure is to\ndestroy the storage, right?\n\n852\n00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,330\nBut there are acceptable ways,\n\n853\n00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:59,530\nif you take a look,\nthere's utilities out there like DBAN.\n\n854\n00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,610\nWhich is, what does that stand for?\n\n855\n00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:03,850\nLike Darik's, yeah Darik's Boot and Nuke.\n\n856\n00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:07,110\nIt's a little bootable disc that\nyou can use to boot up, and\n\n857\n00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:12,380\nit will do repeated writes to a drive to\nwipe the data so it's non-recoverable.\n\n858\n00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:16,851\nAnd it's got several different modes that\nit can run in to be able to ensure that\n\n859\n00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:21,360\nthat data is non-recoverable,\nsome of which are government approved.\n\n860\n00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,640\nApparently they have a commercial\nversion now called Blancco,\n\n861\n00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,870\nI don't know what that is.\n\n862\n00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,420\nSo, all right, why not?\n\n863\n00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,941\nBut, so it can get in there, and\nit can really wipe out the drives, and\n\n864\n00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:34,537\nthen help to ensure that\ndata can't be recovered.\n\n865\n00:42:34,537 --> 00:42:37,023\nBut like I said, if you wanna be sure,\nyou destroy the drive.\n\n866\n00:42:37,023 --> 00:42:41,710\nThere's drive shredders you have magnetic\ntools that can be used to wipe the data.\n\n867\n00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:44,950\nThere's all sorts of different things\nthat can be used to ensure your data\n\n868\n00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:47,030\nis gone and clear.\n\n869\n00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:51,140\nAll right so then there's other\nutilities that are out there.\n\n870\n00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:54,915\nThat's just one that popped\ninto my mind was the DBAN.\n\n871\n00:42:54,915 --> 00:42:58,670\nBut yeah,\nI guess they've gone paid now or, well,\n\n872\n00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:01,920\nlast update, November of 2013,\nthat's not too terribly long ago.\n\n873\n00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,520\nSo, I guess maybe they have a free and\na paid version now.\n\n874\n00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:06,430\nBut anyhow, so\n\n875\n00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:10,610\nthere's various ways to censor, not\ncensor, but sanitize that data and ensure\n\n876\n00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:13,100\nthat somebody can't get at it when you're\ndone with it if you're going to wipe it.\n\n877\n00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,180\nIf you're going to destroy it,\nthat falls under disposing or disposition.\n\n878\n00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:21,390\nWhen you get rid of data, you don't\njust chuck that hard drive in the trash.\n\n879\n00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,480\nSomebody could go dumpster diving and\nget it, and now they've got your data.\n\n880\n00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,360\nSo you need to ensure that\nthe data is properly disposed of.\n\n881\n00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,260\nHard drive shutters are some\nof the best ways to do it.\n\n882\n00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,650\nHave you ever seen those?\n\n883\n00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,170\n>> Yeah, I saw a video of it.\n\n884\n00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:35,980\nThese little moveable\nwheels that go around.\n\n885\n00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,568\n>> Really impressive, and just shreds it\nright out, or there's people that will you\n\n886\n00:43:39,568 --> 00:43:42,709\nknow, run it under a steamroller,\nvarious things like that that work.\n\n887\n00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,230\nWhat about retention, though?\n\n888\n00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:49,360\nSometimes we might be done with the data,\nbut we're required to keep it.\n\n889\n00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,550\nSo like, if you work for a law firm,\nin the state of Florida,\n\n890\n00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:57,600\nmost lawsuits require you to maintain\nthat data on record for seven years.\n\n891\n00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,950\nSo the lawsuit might be over,\nit might be settled and done.\n\n892\n00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:04,480\nAll the proceedings are filed,\nit's over, case closed, and\n\n893\n00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,310\nyou still have to hold the data for\nseven years.\n\n894\n00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,940\nAnd the reason is there\nmight be an appeal,\n\n895\n00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:11,490\nthere might be other things down the road,\nso they make you retain that data.\n\n896\n00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:15,490\nSo, if that's the case, you're no\nlonger actively using the data, but\n\n897\n00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,690\nyou still need to protect it.\n\n898\n00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:21,090\nSo, we'll normally move that\noff to some other area.\n\n899\n00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:22,030\nAnd when we move it off,\n\n900\n00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:25,150\nwe're gonna move it to like lower\ncost storage, SATA storage.\n\n901\n00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:28,670\nMaybe we back it up to backup tape and\nthen erase it off our production system.\n\n902\n00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,480\nSo we just have it on backup tape.\n\n903\n00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,060\nWe're not gonna go accessing it\nanytime soon, so what do we care?\n\n904\n00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,420\nWell, now we've gotta make sure those\nbackup tapes are stored somewhere\n\n905\n00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,670\nsecurely, that they're encrypted,\ncuz if somebody steals that tape they\n\n906\n00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:43,382\ncould start to get access to records that\nwe don't want then to have access to.\n\n907\n00:44:43,382 --> 00:44:48,310\nAll right, and that kinda ties into\nstorage, where you store them.\n\n908\n00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:52,230\nIf you take this data and you throw it\nonto backup tapes and then you stick it,\n\n909\n00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:56,140\njust on a shelf in an unlocked room,\nanybody can get access to it.\n\n910\n00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,780\nThis is data, it's sensitive data,\n\n911\n00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:01,850\nyou should store it either in\na locked server room or in a vault.\n\n912\n00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:03,500\nEngage in a third party.\n\n913\n00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,730\nThere's a company called Iron Mountain\nthat'll store data for you securely.\n\n914\n00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:10,080\nThere's plenty of organizations out\nthere that can take care of that.\n\n915\n00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,380\nOr destroy the data.\n\n916\n00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,290\nYou know, one or the other.\n\n917\n00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:15,070\nEither store it securely or\ndestroy it if you're not going to.\n\n918\n00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:18,032\nBut if you're required to retain it,\nyou need to make sure that it's protected.\n\n919\n00:45:18,032 --> 00:45:21,280\nAll right.\n\n920\n00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,980\nThe last little bit here goes into\nsystems that don't fall under the norm,\n\n921\n00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,820\nwe call them embedded systems.\n\n922\n00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:32,280\nBut, you know we don't have all that\nmuch time left in this segment.\n\n923\n00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,530\nWhat do you think Nate, maybe we\nshould take a break, and get back and\n\n924\n00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:37,820\ntackle this one in the next segment?\n\n925\n00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,670\n>> Mm-hm, all right.\n>> Or do you wanna try and\n\n926\n00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:39,450\npower through it?\n\n927\n00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:42,044\n>> You know what,\nlet's power through it, Don.\n\n928\n00:45:42,044 --> 00:45:44,760\n>> [LAUGH] Do you think we\ncan get through all of this?\n\n929\n00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,480\n>> Yeah, I think so.\n>> This is our on screen debate.\n\n930\n00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,110\nAll right.\n\n931\n00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:48,330\nYeah, I guess it's not a ton.\n\n932\n00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:54,030\nSo what we've been talking about so far is\nreally centered around operating systems\n\n933\n00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:59,040\nand computers that we interact with as end\nusers, and servers, and things like that.\n\n934\n00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,900\nBut what about non-standard equipment?\n\n935\n00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,880\nI mentioned earlier like embedded systems.\n\n936\n00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,100\nWell, that's what CompTIA calls up next,\nis compare and\n\n937\n00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:12,900\ncontrast alternative methods to mitigate\nsecurity risks in static environments,\n\n938\n00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,900\ncuz sometimes the normal\nstuff doesn't work.\n\n939\n00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:19,500\nSo what about, for example, SCADA, right?\n\n940\n00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,206\nI was teasing Nate before the show with\na pop quiz, what does SCADA stand for?\n\n941\n00:46:23,206 --> 00:46:25,070\n>> All right, oh, is this the moment?\n\n942\n00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:26,120\n>> This is the moment,\nthis is the live one.\n\n943\n00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:31,132\n>> All right supervisory control and\n>> And data acquisition.\n\n944\n00:46:31,132 --> 00:46:31,806\nSorry.\n\n945\n00:46:31,806 --> 00:46:35,952\n[LAUGH] The show is only so\nlong, Nate, so [LAUGH].\n\n946\n00:46:35,952 --> 00:46:39,352\nSo, supervisory control and\ndata acquisition.\n\n947\n00:46:39,352 --> 00:46:43,007\nIt's a really long description,\nand what they mean are usually,\n\n948\n00:46:43,007 --> 00:46:45,759\nwe're talking about\nembedded control systems.\n\n949\n00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,750\nI did some work at a cement plant once.\n\n950\n00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:52,260\nAnd at the cement plant they\nhad these giant control boards,\n\n951\n00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,300\nit was almost like NASA,\nyou know, Mission Control?\n\n952\n00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,140\nThey have all those computers\nthat are out there and\n\n953\n00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,200\nthey look like normal computers but\nthey aren't.\n\n954\n00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,630\nThey're purpose built.\n\n955\n00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:01,480\nThey're not running\na normal operating system.\n\n956\n00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,740\nYou can't install\nAOL Instant Messenger on them.\n\n957\n00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:09,260\nThey're running something specific for\ncontrolling a cement mixer, or\n\n958\n00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,690\na Space Shuttle launch, or whatever.\n\n959\n00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:13,850\nAnd that's all they do.\n\n960\n00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:18,360\nAnd they're very proprietary, and\nthey don't run normal software so\n\n961\n00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,908\nyou can't just go and\ninstall anti-virus software on them.\n\n962\n00:47:21,908 --> 00:47:25,990\nYou can't install encryption on them\nbecause they were purpose built\n\n963\n00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:28,000\nas an embedded system.\n\n964\n00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,880\nSo how do you secure those things?\n\n965\n00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,590\nAnd there have been some high profile\ninstances where they weren't secured.\n\n966\n00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:37,680\nYou might remember the Stuxnet worm,\ntrojan, virus,\n\n967\n00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,430\nwhatever, it was kind of all three.\n\n968\n00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:42,050\nStuxnet was a government backed,\n\n969\n00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:47,109\nthis was a very professionally\ndesigned thing, that was designed\n\n970\n00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:52,816\nspecifically to target the SCADA\nsystems in Iranian nuclear facilities.\n\n971\n00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:57,454\nSo somebody, somebody most\nlikely being the US government,\n\n972\n00:47:57,454 --> 00:48:01,823\nwrote this virus to release it,\nto get to those systems and\n\n973\n00:48:01,823 --> 00:48:05,408\nstop this nuclear facility\nfrom functioning.\n\n974\n00:48:05,408 --> 00:48:09,042\nSo, very, very targeted,\ndesigned for one specific system.\n\n975\n00:48:09,042 --> 00:48:10,981\nHow could they have protected from that.\n\n976\n00:48:10,981 --> 00:48:15,541\nWell, the first thing they could have done\nis not had their facility have internet\n\n977\n00:48:15,541 --> 00:48:16,080\naccess.\n\n978\n00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,030\nI, you know, why,\nwhy even make that available?\n\n979\n00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:20,200\nWell, we don't really know\nhow the virus was deployed.\n\n980\n00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,100\nIt's possible there was an insider\nwho took it in via USB.\n\n981\n00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,480\nSo again, don't allow that type of access.\n\n982\n00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,890\nControl those systems.\n\n983\n00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:28,620\nWhen you have Control systems.\n\n984\n00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:31,950\nWhen you have SCADA systems like these,\nthey're really important.\n\n985\n00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,830\nThey should not be on your network.\n\n986\n00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:35,460\nThey should not be connected that way.\n\n987\n00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,750\nIf they need network connectivity,\n\n988\n00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,230\nit should not be the same network\nas the rest of your equipment.\n\n989\n00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:43,300\nIt should be an isolated\nnetwork specifically for that.\n\n990\n00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,950\nIf you go into hospitals,\nyour x-ray equipment, your high scanners,\n\n991\n00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:51,390\nyour CAT scans, those type things,\nthey should be on their own network.\n\n992\n00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:53,450\nNot your email network, right?\n\n993\n00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:56,510\nBecause if they are somebody could be\nintercepting those medical records and\n\n994\n00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:57,570\nshooting them out via email.\n\n995\n00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:00,045\nYou know, that's the type of\nthing we have with SCADA.\n\n996\n00:49:00,045 --> 00:49:02,650\nSCADA systems can't be\nsecured like normal.\n\n997\n00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:06,340\nYou can't install software on them like\nHost Based Intrusion Prevention Software.\n\n998\n00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,120\nSo you need to isolate them.\n\n999\n00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,280\nThat's the best solution.\n\n1000\n00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,540\n>> So, Don, so when you mentioned things\nlike isolating this kind of stuff, right?\n\n1001\n00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,790\nAnd I, and I guess it also, you know,\n\n1002\n00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:18,270\nwould, kind of fall on some of these, you\nknow, oth, other embedded type systems.\n\n1003\n00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:21,760\nBut, as far as isolating them would you,\nwould you stop solely at,\n\n1004\n00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,780\ncreating separate VLANs or\nwould you run separate wires and\n\n1005\n00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:28,640\nhave them on a completely,\ncompletely separate network?\n\n1006\n00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,260\n>> It depends on how critical the data is,\nright?\n\n1007\n00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:34,520\nIf we were talking about medical\nrecords inside of a hospital I'd\n\n1008\n00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,719\nprobably just do VLANs.\n\n1009\n00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:37,090\nVLANs are very safe.\n\n1010\n00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:38,485\nBut if it was a nuclear facility.\n\n1011\n00:49:38,485 --> 00:49:41,300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can be sure sure I'd be running\n\n1012\n00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,150\na separate network.\n\n1013\n00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:43,900\nI mean,\nyou're talking about a nuclear facility.\n\n1014\n00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,360\nAnd and\nit wasn't a military installation right?\n\n1015\n00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,180\nThis was a nuclear power plant.\n\n1016\n00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:49,950\nBut, you're talking about\nthe power grid right.\n\n1017\n00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:53,480\nThey needed that power plant,\nand they should have isolated it.\n\n1018\n00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,270\nIt it just makes sense.\n\n1019\n00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:59,840\nSo, that's the way you address this,\nbased on the sensitivity of that.\n\n1020\n00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,665\nThat system, you know, and\nthere's gonna be various levels for that.\n\n1021\n00:50:03,665 --> 00:50:04,210\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1022\n00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,260\n>> Same thing goes for\nembedded systems, right?\n\n1023\n00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,970\nAnd they may, they call out like printers,\nsmart TVs and HVAC.\n\n1024\n00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:11,380\nAt home I have a Samsung TV.\n\n1025\n00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:15,650\nAnd it's a smart TV, and I plug it into\nthe network, and I can use my cell phone\n\n1026\n00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:19,100\nto turn the volume up and down and stuff\nlike that, and it's pretty neat, right?\n\n1027\n00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:23,530\n>> There's a known exploit for my TV,\nthat somebody could compromise it and,\n\n1028\n00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,840\nyou know, gain access to, to my system.\n\n1029\n00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,200\nWell, there's no patch for it.\n\n1030\n00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,010\nThere's a known exploit for my TV,\nand there is no patch for it.\n\n1031\n00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:32,500\nSo, what do what do I do?\n\n1032\n00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,710\nI can't patch this,\nit's a proprietary system.\n\n1033\n00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:39,002\nSo, I did the only thing I could do,\nwhich is, I unplugged the network cable.\n\n1034\n00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:40,245\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now, that only lasted for\n\n1035\n00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:43,465\na few days cuz I liked being able to use\nmy phone to, to control the volume and\n\n1036\n00:50:43,465 --> 00:50:44,246\nstuff like that.\n\n1037\n00:50:44,246 --> 00:50:47,953\nSo, in the end, I ended up plugging\nit back it into the network, but\n\n1038\n00:50:47,953 --> 00:50:52,327\nmaking sure that my firewall was set not\nto allow the TV to go out to the Internet.\n\n1039\n00:50:52,327 --> 00:50:54,828\nSo, I actually block it on my firewall so\n\n1040\n00:50:54,828 --> 00:50:58,290\nthe TV is only accessible\non my local area network.\n\n1041\n00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:01,920\nIf any of you guys come to my house,\nyou can hack into my TV, right.\n\n1042\n00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,420\nBut, if you're at home and you're trying\nto go over the Internet to break into my\n\n1043\n00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,700\nTV, you won't be able to get there.\n\n1044\n00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:11,160\nSo, I recognize that\nthat system is nonsecure,\n\n1045\n00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,960\nI still use it, but I just don't\nallow it to have Internet access.\n\n1046\n00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,183\nOn the printer side, you know so\nmany printers these days have a network\n\n1047\n00:51:18,183 --> 00:51:21,410\nconnection right, that you can\nplug in your physical network.\n\n1048\n00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:25,230\nAnd a lot of them have like internet\nprinting protocol or IPP turned on.\n\n1049\n00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:27,770\nAnd IPP is not the most secure protocol.\n\n1050\n00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:31,210\nBut, again, if you block it on your\nfirewall or you disable it in the printer,\n\n1051\n00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,460\nthen you don't have to worry about it.\n\n1052\n00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,780\nSo you just disable the stuff\nyou're not gonna use.\n\n1053\n00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:37,770\nAll right, oh, the printer supports\nApple Talk and you're not gonna use it?\n\n1054\n00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:39,460\nTurn it off, right?\n\n1055\n00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:43,050\nYou know what's going to be turned on by\ndefault, sure, that's what the vendors do.\n\n1056\n00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:45,880\nBut, you can just go right down\nthe list and turn them off.\n\n1057\n00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,189\nYour HVAC right like heating,\nventilation and air conditioning, so you,\n\n1058\n00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,283\nyour air conditioning.\n\n1059\n00:51:50,283 --> 00:51:54,722\nI have a, a thermostat at home that\nsupports well we'll leave my thermostat\n\n1060\n00:51:54,722 --> 00:51:59,183\nout of it you can get like a Nest right\neverybody knows the, the Nest thermostat.\n\n1061\n00:51:59,183 --> 00:52:02,677\nIt's network enabled and it reaches\nout to the Internet all the time.\n\n1062\n00:52:02,677 --> 00:52:05,564\nWhat if somebody were to break in to that,\nright, and\n\n1063\n00:52:05,564 --> 00:52:07,820\nsomebody gains access to your Nest.\n\n1064\n00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:11,530\nThey could run your ac up, or down,\nreally, it'll make you uncomfortable.\n\n1065\n00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:13,505\nThat's about all they could do I suppose.\n\n1066\n00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:17,300\nBut but, but\nyou don't want that to happen.\n\n1067\n00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,610\nSo again you can use your\nfirewall to protect that.\n\n1068\n00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:22,800\nYou can restrict connections to and\nfrom that nest\n\n1069\n00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,100\nto the servers that are on the internet\nthat it actually needs to talk to.\n\n1070\n00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,829\nTo Google's IP range or, or wherever.\n\n1071\n00:52:26,829 --> 00:52:29,395\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1072\n00:52:29,395 --> 00:52:31,845\n>> All right, other ones where it gets\na little more difficult, Android,\n\n1073\n00:52:31,845 --> 00:52:32,865\niOS, right?\n\n1074\n00:52:32,865 --> 00:52:33,665\nThose guys.\n\n1075\n00:52:33,665 --> 00:52:37,515\nWell you can install host based\nintrusion prevention systems on those,\n\n1076\n00:52:37,515 --> 00:52:38,685\nthere's ways to monitor them.\n\n1077\n00:52:38,685 --> 00:52:40,630\nYou have a lot more freedom with that.\n\n1078\n00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:44,012\nWell, I just made the mistake of\nusing the word freedom with iOS.\n\n1079\n00:52:44,012 --> 00:52:44,640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n1080\n00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,325\nyou have limited freedom with iOS.\n\n1081\n00:52:47,325 --> 00:52:49,620\n[LAUGH] Does that even make sense?\n\n1082\n00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:50,550\nSo, you know,\n\n1083\n00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:53,270\nthere is stuff you can install to\nbe able to remotely manage those.\n\n1084\n00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:55,690\nThey're, they're designed a lot more for\ncorporate environments.\n\n1085\n00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:56,845\nWe've already talked about those.\n\n1086\n00:52:56,845 --> 00:52:57,840\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1087\n00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,510\n>> What about a mainframe?\n\n1088\n00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:03,500\nAll right, mainframes rarely have\nsecurity mechanisms built into\n\n1089\n00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,030\nthem because they're\ndesigned to handle data.\n\n1090\n00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:09,490\nThey're designed to handle it fast and\nto scale very large, that's what they do,\n\n1091\n00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:10,390\nall right?\n\n1092\n00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:15,130\nSo when it comes to protecting that data,\nyou can't rely on the mainframe.\n\n1093\n00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:18,920\nYou're going to have to use additional\nsystems, IPS scanners, right?\n\n1094\n00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:23,010\nYou know, in line IPS in between your\nnetwork and the mainframe, a firewall,\n\n1095\n00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:25,690\na physical firewall in between\nyour network and the mainframe.\n\n1096\n00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:28,930\nAnd you can use those to provide\nthe security that your mainframe likely\n\n1097\n00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:29,980\ndoesn't right.\n\n1098\n00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:33,400\nYour mainframe might, but even if your\nmainframe does provide that type of\n\n1099\n00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:37,640\nsecurity it's not a good idea to use it\nbecause it's going to affect performance.\n\n1100\n00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:42,130\nUse dedicated appliances to provide\nthe level of performance you need\n\n1101\n00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:43,290\nwhile still getting security.\n\n1102\n00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,760\nAll right Game consoles.\n\n1103\n00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,210\nIt's funny to see them mentioned here,\n\n1104\n00:53:49,210 --> 00:53:53,280\nbut game consoles increasingly\nare relying on an internet connection.\n\n1105\n00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,580\nYour, your Xbox's, your PlayStation's,\neven the portable ones, right,\n\n1106\n00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:01,180\nthey want to reach out on the network and,\nand have that access and\n\n1107\n00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:03,330\nthat means they can be compromised, right.\n\n1108\n00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:06,950\nCan we install security\nsoftware on those devices?\n\n1109\n00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:10,100\nNo, we can't, right or at least\nnone of the ones I have you can't.\n\n1110\n00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,670\nSo how do you protect those?\n\n1111\n00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:13,830\nYou keep them up-to-date.\n\n1112\n00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:15,700\nYou rely on the vendors to\nkeep it up-to-date, but\n\n1113\n00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,513\nyou see how well they do,\nlike PlayStation.\n\n1114\n00:54:18,513 --> 00:54:22,330\n[LAUGH] So, so, you just, you just\ndon't know how they're being secured.\n\n1115\n00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:24,410\nSo they really shouldn't be used\nin a corporate environment anyway.\n\n1116\n00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:26,860\nBut what if you are,\nwhat if you're Best Buy?\n\n1117\n00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:29,070\nAnd so\nyou need to have a couple of Xboxes or\n\n1118\n00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:32,380\nPlayStation's on your sales floor\nto be able to show to customers.\n\n1119\n00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,280\nAnd you want them to have\nthat internet access.\n\n1120\n00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,850\nBut you don't want them\nto get broken into.\n\n1121\n00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:39,595\nSo again, you need to use physical\nfirewalls to be able to protect them.\n\n1122\n00:54:39,595 --> 00:54:42,310\n>> Mm-hm, yeah, you know, or even you\nknow, separating these guys out into their\n\n1123\n00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:45,420\nown, their own little little network or\nsome kind of DMZ, you know.\n\n1124\n00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:49,800\nA lot of those game consoles, they need\na variety of, of ports open to, you know,\n\n1125\n00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,515\nbe able to connect out\ninto the game servers.\n\n1126\n00:54:51,515 --> 00:54:53,610\n>> Hm-hm.\n>> Or have other systems connect in to it.\n\n1127\n00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:56,130\nYou know, PlayStation,\nthey have a little deal where\n\n1128\n00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:59,890\nyou can take your PlayStation and\ncall over to another PlayStation.\n\n1129\n00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:01,500\nBe able to connect to it directly.\n\n1130\n00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:06,010\nSo you can kinda have like little Netplay\nsystems directly in with each other.\n\n1131\n00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:09,290\nSo, you know, yeah, I mean you have to\nhave open ports to it and that, can,\n\n1132\n00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:13,330\nyou know, then punch unnecessary\nholes into a firewall with that.\n\n1133\n00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:16,590\n>> Yeah, and those can be exploited too,\nthat little basically a tunnel that it\n\n1134\n00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:18,700\nbuilds between those systems\ncan be exploited and\n\n1135\n00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,280\nmove more data than what you expect.\n\n1136\n00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,950\nSo, definitely something\nwe have to be careful with.\n\n1137\n00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,410\nThe last one on the list is\nin-vehicle computing systems and\n\n1138\n00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:29,430\nthis is one that's been gaining\nvisibility over the last several years.\n\n1139\n00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:32,700\nIt's pretty hard to buy a car these days\nthat doesn't have Bluetooth support.\n\n1140\n00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,020\nAlmost all of them do.\n\n1141\n00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:36,950\nAnd there's several well-known\nBluetooth exploits for\n\n1142\n00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:41,070\nbeing able to gain access to a car to\nbe able to monitor phone calls and\n\n1143\n00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:42,505\nother communications that are going on.\n\n1144\n00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,315\nThat may not be something you want.\n\n1145\n00:55:44,315 --> 00:55:48,275\nNow, cars are even, you know,\nthey're basically SCADA systems.\n\n1146\n00:55:48,275 --> 00:55:50,535\nYou know,\nthere's not a lot you can do to your car.\n\n1147\n00:55:50,535 --> 00:55:53,365\nCan you install more software,\ncan you do anything like that?\n\n1148\n00:55:53,365 --> 00:55:54,275\nNot really.\n\n1149\n00:55:54,275 --> 00:55:56,215\nSo you've really only got two choices.\n\n1150\n00:55:56,215 --> 00:56:00,375\nChoice number one is to replace that\nhardware in your system with something\n\n1151\n00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:01,580\nthat's more secure.\n\n1152\n00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,729\nOr two, disable it, right?\n\n1153\n00:56:03,729 --> 00:56:06,438\nIf you're not using the Bluetooth\nfunctionality in your car,\n\n1154\n00:56:06,438 --> 00:56:07,366\nturn it off, right?\n\n1155\n00:56:07,366 --> 00:56:08,932\nYou don't have to have that.\n\n1156\n00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:12,326\nSo, there's ways that we can go about\nkind of protecting ourselves By\n\n1157\n00:56:12,326 --> 00:56:14,060\neliminating that functionality.\n\n1158\n00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:15,441\nNow there's some things\nyou can't turn off.\n\n1159\n00:56:15,441 --> 00:56:19,780\nWe're starting to see a lot of\nkeyless ignitions in cars, right?\n\n1160\n00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,460\nAnd you can't just\nchoose to turn that off.\n\n1161\n00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,300\nThere's no place to put the key anymore.\n\n1162\n00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:23,989\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's just a button.\n\n1163\n00:56:23,989 --> 00:56:28,055\nSo, sometimes it's forced upon you and, in\nthat case you're, you're taking that risk.\n\n1164\n00:56:28,055 --> 00:56:32,058\nSo you need to make sure that's part\nof your, your purchasing process.\n\n1165\n00:56:32,058 --> 00:56:35,070\nThat you evaluate how\nsecure those systems are.\n\n1166\n00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:35,760\nMm.\n\n1167\n00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:36,380\nAlright.\n\n1168\n00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:39,340\nSo that's kind of the,\nthe overview of those scenarios and\n\n1169\n00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:41,020\nthey just give us some of\nthe solutions down here.\n\n1170\n00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,540\nI think we talked about all of these.\n\n1171\n00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,040\nNetwork segmentation,\nthat's where we isolate\n\n1172\n00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:49,050\nsystems that they can't be\nproperly secured, security layers.\n\n1173\n00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:51,300\nThat's where we don't just do\nsecurity on the device but\n\n1174\n00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,940\nwe implement a layer approach.\n\n1175\n00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:57,120\nWe have IPS's and firewalls and\nother things between the outsiders and\n\n1176\n00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,730\nthe device we're securing.\n\n1177\n00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:01,030\nApplication firewall same same thing.\n\n1178\n00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:05,750\nManual updates to keep our systems up to\ndate if automatic updates aren't supported\n\n1179\n00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,390\nFirmware version control.\n\n1180\n00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:09,640\nNow, this one is important.\n\n1181\n00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,470\nWe don't necessarily wanna roll out\nnew firmware just because it came out.\n\n1182\n00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:15,860\nCisco is bad about this, alright.\n\n1183\n00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,810\nWith if you have a Cisco switch.\n\n1184\n00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:21,870\nJust because new software comes out for\nit doesn't mean you need to go and\n\n1185\n00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:23,140\ndeploy it, alright?\n\n1186\n00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,590\nYou need to look at what happened.\n\n1187\n00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:28,990\nCisco may just be doing a feature update,\nnew features, not new security.\n\n1188\n00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:33,190\nAnd in that case, adding new features\nmay actually weaken your system,\n\n1189\n00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:36,470\nintroduce new exploits that\nyou didn't have before.\n\n1190\n00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:39,490\nSo if it's a security update,\nyes, do it, but\n\n1191\n00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:42,640\nif it's a feature update,\nevaluate whether you need that feature.\n\n1192\n00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:46,490\nYou may not want to do that\nfirmware update, right?\n\n1193\n00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:48,310\nThere's also wrappers, right?\n\n1194\n00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:51,620\nThat was the [LAUGH] the joke of my,\nmy subtitle earlier.\n\n1195\n00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:54,810\nWith wrappers, what we do is we say okay.\n\n1196\n00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:57,600\nI might have a system that needs Telnet,\nright?\n\n1197\n00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,660\nIt's a data system and\nit just works via Telnet.\n\n1198\n00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:04,150\nWell, Telnet's not secure,\nso how can i secure that?\n\n1199\n00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:08,080\nWell, i can put in another\nsystem in between them that\n\n1200\n00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:11,750\ntakes the network data and\nputs it into an IPSec tunnel and\n\n1201\n00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:14,520\nbasically encrypts the data so\ni can then send it in transit.\n\n1202\n00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,630\nWe're wrapping that data up.\n\n1203\n00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:19,090\nIn something else that's more secure,\nright?\n\n1204\n00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:21,220\nOr you run that software inside\nof a virtual machine and\n\n1205\n00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:25,340\nthat virtual machine builds the VPN tunnel\nor something of that nature to secure it.\n\n1206\n00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:29,240\nSo you may need to wrap that original\ndata up inside of something more secure.\n\n1207\n00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:34,890\nAnd then lastly control redundancy and\ndiversity.\n\n1208\n00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:37,370\nThis is especially true\nwith Scada systems.\n\n1209\n00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:41,370\nIf your primary control system fails,\nyou need a backup.\n\n1210\n00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:45,420\nAnd preferably a backup\nof a different type.\n\n1211\n00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:50,380\nSo if your main controlling\nsystem is running Windows XP.\n\n1212\n00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:51,130\nRight?\n\n1213\n00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:52,710\nAnd it gets broken into.\n\n1214\n00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:53,700\nIt gets compromised.\n\n1215\n00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,790\nThere's some exploit.\n\n1216\n00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:57,270\nAnd your backup system is\nalso running Windows XP,\n\n1217\n00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:59,450\nwhat's gonna happen when you\nbring the backup system up?\n\n1218\n00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:01,430\nIt's just gonna get broken into also, so\n\n1219\n00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:04,000\nwouldn't it be nice to have a backup\nsystem that's running something\n\n1220\n00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,190\ncompletely different, a different OS,\na different solution?\n\n1221\n00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:07,830\nRight?\n\n1222\n00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:10,570\nSo you know this is how\nalmost all banks operate.\n\n1223\n00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:14,800\nThey've got their teller machines, which\nare fully online communicating back with\n\n1224\n00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:17,710\nheadquarters but if they go offline,\nwhat do they do?\n\n1225\n00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:19,680\nBreak out the paper and\npencil, and the adding machine,\n\n1226\n00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,050\nand they start doing paper transactions.\n\n1227\n00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:25,400\nAnd that's because if they just\nbrought up another computer,\n\n1228\n00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,570\nit would have the same\nproblem as the first one.\n\n1229\n00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:30,130\nBut going to paper transactions,\nthey not that'll work.\n\n1230\n00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:32,500\nSo having that redundancy and diversity,\n\n1231\n00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,940\nbeing able to flip over to some other\nenvironment to keep us up and running.\n\n1232\n00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:38,445\nYou know those are all important elements,\nso.\n\n1233\n00:59:38,445 --> 00:59:39,390\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1234\n00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:42,750\n>> Yeah, that's a, a lot of times that's\none of the bigger challenges we have in\n\n1235\n00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,620\nIT security is securing the computers?\n\n1236\n00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:48,240\nThat's usually pretty straight\nforward because the vendors have so\n\n1237\n00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,620\nmany options for you.\n\n1238\n00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:52,930\nBut securing the non-standard stuff,\nthat's where we really gotta start\n\n1239\n00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:55,376\nthinking outside of the box and trying\nto come up with different solutions.\n\n1240\n00:59:55,376 --> 00:59:56,086\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1241\n00:59:56,086 --> 00:59:57,212\n>> So.\n>> Alright.\n\n1242\n00:59:57,212 --> 00:59:59,388\n[SOUND] Nate you got\nanything to add to that?\n\n1243\n00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:03,737\n>> Really no, it yeah, covered pretty\nwell, so we got some strategies out there\n\n1244\n01:00:03,737 --> 01:00:06,845\nto deal with all the different\nkinds of our host security and\n\n1245\n01:00:06,845 --> 01:00:11,406\nour mobile security and, and those sorts\nof times and our application security.\n\n1246\n01:00:11,406 --> 01:00:13,748\nSo, you know,\nwe've got a lot of solutions out there and\n\n1247\n01:00:13,748 --> 01:00:16,570\na lot of different avenues that\nwe can take to secure our stuff.\n\n1248\n01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:17,630\n>> Sweet.\n\n1249\n01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:19,570\nWell we've got a lot more coming up, but\n\n1250\n01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:22,380\nthat pretty much wraps\nup the objective 4.0.\n\n1251\n01:00:22,380 -->

Thank you for having me, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.143\nI'm excited to be here.\n\n12\n00:00:32.143 --> 00:00:35.296\nAnd I'm excited to go ahead and\ntake a look at some different\n\n13\n00:00:35.296 --> 00:00:39.020\noptions we have to go ahead and\nsecure our mobile devices.\n\n14\n00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.000\nI'm sure you have or\nknow someone who has a cell phone.\n\n15\n00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.700\nIt's very common in this day in age.\n\n16\n00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.848\nKids these days don't even see\n[LAUGH] what phone booths are.\n\n17\n00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:51.000\nWe have our cell phones.\n\n18\n00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.190\n&gt;&gt; So, Cherokee, the idea here\nof working with mobile devices\n\n19\n00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.490\n&gt;&gt; Basic security,\n\n20\n00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.210\nI have a pin number locked on my screen.\n\n21\n00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.260\nWhat do I need to be concerned\nabout if that's all I have?\n\n22\n00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.420\nThat's all I need, right?\n\n23\n00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.007\n&gt;&gt; Right, and with this concept of BYOD,\nwe're bringing our own devices to work,\n\n24\n00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:11.364\nbring your own device.\n\n25\n00:01:11.364 --> 00:01:15.210\nAnd you might think okay,\nkeeping my phone at home, it's safe.\n\n26\n00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.930\nBut now that you're bringing it to\nthe work place, an environment that\n\n27\n00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.990\nyou don't really have complete control\nover, there are additional concerns.\n\n28\n00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.150\nWe have so\nmuch information stored on these devices.\n\n29\n00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.861\nPictures, you might have some kind of\nonline banking app, things of that nature\n\n30\n00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:36.728\nthat are generally sensitive and you just\ndon't want that information out there.\n\n31\n00:01:36.728 --> 00:01:39.976\n&gt;&gt; So Cherokee, go ahead and\ndefine that idea of BYOD for us, and\n\n32\n00:01:39.976 --> 00:01:41.885\nwhat it means in terms of security.\n\n33\n00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:43.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And why is it that I have to\n\n34\n00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.310\nworry about it and why would\na company have to worry about it?\n\n35\n00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.247\n&gt;&gt; Yes, and that's a really good\ntopic that you pointed out,\n\n36\n00:01:50.247 --> 00:01:55.390\nbecause both individuals have their\nown concerns about these BYOD devices.\n\n37\n00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.170\nAnd It's kind of interesting because\nit opens up a whole new realm.\n\n38\n00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.970\nSo, previously if we had a 40 hour a week\nemployee, as an employer I can say hey\n\n39\n00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.840\nRonnie, why don't you go ahead and install\nyour work email on your mobile device,\n\n40\n00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.615\nyour tablet, your cellphone, so\nI can contact you if something goes wrong?\n\n41\n00:02:15.615 --> 00:02:19.668\n[LAUGH] So\nessentially Ronnie is now a 24 hour\n\n42\n00:02:19.668 --> 00:02:24.470\naround-the-clock employee,\nand employers love that idea.\n\n43\n00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.170\nThey don't have to fork out\nthe expense to pay for Ronnie for\n\n44\n00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.359\nall these extra devices.\n\n45\n00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:32.630\nSince Ronnie already has a smartphone,\nwe'll just use what he already has.\n\n46\n00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.730\nSo it's beneficial to\nthe employer in that way, and\n\n47\n00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.430\nthat's why they allow these kind of\ndevices brought on their network.\n\n48\n00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.389\nYes, it does give a bit of\na headache as far as having just\n\n49\n00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.780\na real large mix of\ndifferent types of devices.\n\n50\n00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.920\nAnd that's what our IT staff really\nis in charge of making sure all\n\n51\n00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.329\nof these devices are either covered or\n\n52\n00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.650\nare adhering to our security policies or\nacceptable use policies.\n\n53\n00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.720\n&gt;&gt; Now, what we actually mean here by\nBYOD though is bring your own device.\n\n54\n00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.670\nWhat Cherokee is describing\nto us is a scenario\n\n55\n00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.300\nin which we're starting to see more and\nmore of over the last three or four years.\n\n56\n00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.530\nThe very fact is we are having companies\nthat are saying here let me go ahead and\n\n57\n00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.519\nbuy you a laptop.\n\n58\n00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.920\nAnd now you know they say go and\npick one up.\n\n59\n00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.260\nAnd then you go and pick one out,\nthe company pays for it and\n\n60\n00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.280\nyou become that 24 hour employee.\n\n61\n00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.070\nThere are issues that we have to worry\nabout because now what's going on is that\n\n62\n00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.810\nthere's actually things that we don't\nknow what the security is on that device.\n\n63\n00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.560\nWe don't know where the data\nactually resides when you do\n\n64\n00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.490\nsomething like that and\nwho's going to be responsible for it.\n\n65\n00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.980\nSo, we need to address some of\nthese different concerns so\n\n66\n00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.160\nthat you understand that we have\nto provide some type of security.\n\n67\n00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.840\nSo, Cherokee, what are some of the\ndifferent concerns that if I'm a security\n\n68\n00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.290\nprofessional, that I need to start\nthinking about in terms of addressing?\n\n69\n00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.500\n&gt;&gt; Okay so\none thing that both the company and\n\n70\n00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.360\nthe individual should be thinking\nabout would be data ownership.\n\n71\n00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.610\nSo like Ronnie mentioned,\nif a company purchases a laptop for\n\n72\n00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.100\nme, they bought the laptop\nwith their own money.\n\n73\n00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.520\nIf I bring my cellphone and I have some\nwork documents stored on that device,\n\n74\n00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.240\nyou kind of come into a weird situation\nwhere, okay you own a device but\n\n75\n00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.050\nthat's my intellectual property.\n\n76\n00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.200\nSo if you lose that device,\nI'm gonna be potentially at a loss\n\n77\n00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.360\nbecause of whatever it is that\nthey may lose with that data.\n\n78\n00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.630\nSo it's definitely something that\nshould be addressed and It's a problem.\n\n79\n00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.418\nAnd companies are starting to see this\nproblem and they're finding solutions, so\n\n80\n00:04:31.418 --> 00:04:34.340\nthat's what we'll talk\nabout in a few moments.\n\n81\n00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.545\n&gt;&gt; The other aspect of this idea of data\nownership happens to be that even though\n\n82\n00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:43.160\nas to company's intellectual property,\nit now resides on my own private device.\n\n83\n00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.595\nAnd a lot of times you do have to\nthink about the idea here that,\n\n84\n00:04:46.595 --> 00:04:50.590\nwell, ownership actually starts\nwith the idea of possession.\n\n85\n00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.210\nSo even though you might own the\nproperties of it, it's in my possession.\n\n86\n00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.290\nI don't necessarily have to tell\nyou what I'm doing with that\n\n87\n00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.060\nparticular information.\n\n88\n00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.689\nI might be doing something\nnefarious with it.\n\n89\n00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:03.310\nI might be doing something\nillegal with it, hopefully not.\n\n90\n00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.870\nBut essentially,\nyou can't do that because I own it.\n\n91\n00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.570\nWell, the very fact is that it now\nresides privately on my own device\n\n92\n00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.720\nmeans you don't have control over it.\n\n93\n00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.190\nSo there are issues that we\ndo have to address there, and\n\n94\n00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.880\nwe'll talk about some of the ways\nthat we can do that, too.\n\n95\n00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.543\nNow, Cherokee, that's not the only issue,\nthough, is it?\n\n96\n00:05:19.543 --> 00:05:22.035\n&gt;&gt; No,\n[LAUGH] what happens if I go ahead and\n\n97\n00:05:22.035 --> 00:05:26.262\nI install some software that I\nwasn't supposed to, or just if I was\n\n98\n00:05:26.262 --> 00:05:31.340\nhaving hardware issues with that laptop\nthat the company purchased for me.\n\n99\n00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.090\nSo whose responsibility is it?\n\n100\n00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.062\nOr what if I used my cellphone\nto go ahead and do work and\n\n101\n00:05:36.062 --> 00:05:38.585\nthen now my cellphone\ngets dropped in water?\n\n102\n00:05:38.585 --> 00:05:40.730\nWho should pay for the repairs?\n\n103\n00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.540\nThat's an issue that needs to be discussed\nahead of time because you don't want to\n\n104\n00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.780\nwait until the last minute, so you really\nneed to outline who should be responsible.\n\n105\n00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.590\nYou need to think about\nthe data ownership.\n\n106\n00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.510\nYou need to think about\nthe support ownership there.\n\n107\n00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.040\nYou also need to think\nabout patch management.\n\n108\n00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.010\nSo does your company already have\nsomething in place to go ahead and\n\n109\n00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.040\nsay look, you're not gonna be able\nto use this device if it does not\n\n110\n00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.740\nthe latest firmware and the latest updates\navailable for that particular device.\n\n111\n00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.650\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee, when we start taking\na look at that idea especially of things\n\n112\n00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.780\nlike patch management,\nmost end users are prior not gonna even be\n\n113\n00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.430\nconcerned about the idea\nof patch management.\n\n114\n00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.134\nI know that on my own, I've seen this\nhappen over time, where somebody is given\n\n115\n00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:28.998\na chance and it actually shows up on their\nphone that says please update the phone.\n\n116\n00:06:28.998 --> 00:06:31.315\nAnd they go,\nI've been ignore that for weeks now.\n\n117\n00:06:31.315 --> 00:06:31.918\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n118\n00:06:31.918 --> 00:06:35.763\nif you think about it, for a company\nit's a little bit more frightening,\n\n119\n00:06:35.763 --> 00:06:40.330\nbecause your own data, or your company's\ndata is now residing on that phone.\n\n120\n00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.593\nAnd usually the patches are issued\nout because there might be some type\n\n121\n00:06:43.593 --> 00:06:44.652\nof security concern.\n\n122\n00:06:44.652 --> 00:06:49.317\nAnd now you have your company's data on\nthe device, which you cannot account for\n\n123\n00:06:49.317 --> 00:06:51.570\nthe security of it, as well.\n\n124\n00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.858\nSo this is where companies are gonna end\nup trying to decide on what they're gonna\n\n125\n00:06:55.858 --> 00:06:59.025\nbe willing to support in the future\nin terms of patching it.\n\n126\n00:06:59.025 --> 00:07:03.517\nThere are so many different mobile devices\nout there today that it's impossible for\n\n127\n00:07:03.517 --> 00:07:06.174\none company to be able\nto support the 20,000\n\n128\n00:07:06.174 --> 00:07:07.002\nphones-\n&gt;&gt; All of them.\n\n129\n00:07:07.002 --> 00:07:08.600\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That are out there.\n\n130\n00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.717\nAnd what you might end up finding out in\nthe future, even though it's not starting\n\n131\n00:07:12.717 --> 00:07:16.118\nto happen yet, is that it may be\nlike one day when ITProTV says look,\n\n132\n00:07:16.118 --> 00:07:18.760\nthere's two models of\nphone we're gonna support.\n\n133\n00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.500\nSo if you want to be able to use this,\nthese are the two.\n\n134\n00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.115\nBut besides that, you're not gonna connect\nto our network, you're not gonna be able\n\n135\n00:07:26.115 --> 00:07:29.544\nto get access to the information that you\nneed without choosing those two models.\n\n136\n00:07:29.544 --> 00:07:32.555\nCuz those are probably the only two\nthat we can actually think about\n\n137\n00:07:32.555 --> 00:07:35.351\nthe idea of even supporting in\nterms of the physical device but\n\n138\n00:07:35.351 --> 00:07:36.990\nalso the patch management as well.\n\n139\n00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz you think about\nany kind of management.\n\n140\n00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.840\nIf you have devices, we'll talk about\nlike, on-boarding and health policies.\n\n141\n00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.290\nBut if I have an application, a persistent\napplication, like a persistent agent,\n\n142\n00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.120\nto monitor the health of that device.\n\n143\n00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.840\nWell, think about it, developers,\nthey have to write that application.\n\n144\n00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.791\nIf I have an iOS device, they have to\nwrite it in that programming language.\n\n145\n00:07:54.791 --> 00:07:58.221\nAnd then if I have a Windows device or\nAn android device, so\n\n146\n00:07:58.221 --> 00:08:00.324\nit just gets really complex there.\n\n147\n00:08:00.324 --> 00:08:04.553\nAnd so that's why you might see that\nuniform policy being pushed out for\n\n148\n00:08:04.553 --> 00:08:05.610\nthese devices.\n\n149\n00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.410\nSo, a lot to think about here,\nlike I said.\n\n150\n00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.020\nAnother thing would be\nanti-virus management which\n\n151\n00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.220\nmay be offered by your company as\na corporate solution and go ahead and\n\n152\n00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.390\npush them out to all those devices.\n\n153\n00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.570\nIt may be a smaller company or\none that isn't able to support that so\n\n154\n00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.100\nyou might be responsible for\ndoing that yourself.\n\n155\n00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:28.120\nAnd later on this episode we'll take\na look at some solutions for that.\n\n156\n00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.610\nAnd then also,\nyou have to think about forensics.\n\n157\n00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.040\nSecurity incidents may happen\nwithin your environment.\n\n158\n00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.110\nSo, let's say your phone that you use for\n\n159\n00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:43.220\nbusiness was containing messages\nthat maybe someone sent you that\n\n160\n00:08:45.445 --> 00:08:49.505\nimplicated them in some way,\nto some sort of illegal activity.\n\n161\n00:08:49.505 --> 00:08:53.365\nSo now, is this device going to be taken,\nfor evidence?\n\n162\n00:08:53.365 --> 00:08:57.985\nAnd you're like hey, how are my family\nmembers going to contact me, and\n\n163\n00:08:57.985 --> 00:08:59.216\nthings like that.\n\n164\n00:08:59.216 --> 00:09:02.896\nIt's always a good idea to really address\nthese ideas before you just say hey\n\n165\n00:09:02.896 --> 00:09:04.730\nI'll use my phone for work.\n\n166\n00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.250\nIf it's that big of a concern for you,\n\n167\n00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:10.610\nyou might want to go ahead and keep your\nbusiness and personal completely separate\n\n168\n00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:15.194\nthere because there really is a grey\nline that can get pretty fuzzy at times.\n\n169\n00:09:15.194 --> 00:09:19.273\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt the issue that most\nend users have with doing something like\n\n170\n00:09:19.273 --> 00:09:20.526\nthis is fairly simple,\n\n171\n00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:24.114\nis that now you're actually having\nto carry two different phones.\n\n172\n00:09:24.114 --> 00:09:26.785\nAnd if you actually decided,\nI don't know why you would do this, but\n\n173\n00:09:26.785 --> 00:09:29.287\nlet's say that Cherokee decided,\nthat's what I'm gonna do.\n\n174\n00:09:29.287 --> 00:09:32.975\nI'm just gonna keep two separate ones,\nwhat if she picks the exact identical\n\n175\n00:09:32.975 --> 00:09:35.254\nphones for\nboth of those in terms of doing that.\n\n176\n00:09:35.254 --> 00:09:37.550\nShe doesn't know exactly which\none she's answering at the time,\n\n177\n00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.826\nshe doesn't know what's going on.\n\n178\n00:09:38.826 --> 00:09:39.376\n&gt;&gt; So confused.\n\n179\n00:09:39.376 --> 00:09:43.294\n&gt;&gt; She's very easy to get confused unless\nshe's willing to carry on both of them at\n\n180\n00:09:43.294 --> 00:09:44.056\nthe same time.\n\n181\n00:09:44.056 --> 00:09:46.650\nAnd so Cherokee, you'd actually\nhave to go into those double.\n\n182\n00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:47.770\n&gt;&gt; A fanny pack or something.\n\n183\n00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.646\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nthose holsters to help you out here.\n\n184\n00:09:49.646 --> 00:09:51.658\nBut privacy is a big concern for\n\n185\n00:09:51.658 --> 00:09:56.780\nus when we start talking about that idea\nof BYOD, because of issues like this.\n\n186\n00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:00.490\nNow, you and I, as individuals,\nwe probably don't think about that.\n\n187\n00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:04.190\nBut the very fact is,\nthey are concerns for companies.\n\n188\n00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:05.940\nAnd so, you're gonna see more and\n\n189\n00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.480\nmore policies geared towards\ndoing something like that, okay?\n\n190\n00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.840\nSo, Cherokee,\nwhat is this about the idea of onboarding,\n\n191\n00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.570\noffboarding that we have to worry about.\n\n192\n00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nalso to note there though, Ronnie,\n\n193\n00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.970\nI do have a solution I'm gonna share with\nyou guys instead of having two phones, but\n\n194\n00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.980\njust hang with us because I'm\ngonna save that for the end.\n\n195\n00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.970\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Onboarding and\n\n196\n00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.060\noffboarding, okay.\n\n197\n00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:29.690\nSo, you just got hired to a new company.\n\n198\n00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:30.800\nYou're excited.\n\n199\n00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:35.570\nUsually the companies will have some form\nof training like an orientation process\n\n200\n00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:39.390\nwhere they have any kind of\njob specific training but\n\n201\n00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.670\nalso at that time you get\na huge stack of papers.\n\n202\n00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:45.800\nYou have to sign up for if they provide\nhealth insurance, things like that.\n\n203\n00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.530\nSo, in these stack of papers,\n\n204\n00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.780\nyou're probably going to go ahead and\nget some sort of policies.\n\n205\n00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:55.290\nYour corporate security policies,\nyour acceptable use policies, and\n\n206\n00:10:55.290 --> 00:11:00.180\nthose should all define or\noutline what kind of devices can, or\n\n207\n00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.740\nif any at all, be brought into the\nenvironment nd how they should be handled.\n\n208\n00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.770\nBecause ultimately, it is\nthe responsibility of that organization,\n\n209\n00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:12.350\nthe responsibility of that network\nadministrator to go ahead and\n\n210\n00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.020\nbe responsible for\nwhat happens on their network.\n\n211\n00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.240\nSo, if they're connecting to\nyour networking equipment,\n\n212\n00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:21.900\nto your network, you are in fact\nresponsible, that organization.\n\n213\n00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.970\nSo, during this onboarding process what\nmay happen is they say, hey Ronnie,\n\n214\n00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:28.480\nI see you have your phone.\n\n215\n00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.600\nYou'd like to use it for work, but\nin order to do that I have to verify that\n\n216\n00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:38.760\nyour device will go ahead and meet my\nstandard To be healthy for my network.\n\n217\n00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.400\nSo, I may go ahead and\nshow you my health policy.\n\n218\n00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.360\nIt should include things like\nanti-malware of some form.\n\n219\n00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.430\nIt might even include some\nkind of remote wiping for\n\n220\n00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.630\nthat phone in case it's lost Stolen or\nwhatever.\n\n221\n00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.860\nIt should include things\nlike approved applications,\n\n222\n00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.770\napproved software on that device.\n\n223\n00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:59.850\nAnd it should also include\nsomething like we just spoke about,\n\n224\n00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:04.640\nwould be patch management and say, look,\nif you decide not to update your phone and\n\n225\n00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.640\nit's for personal use, that's fine.\n\n226\n00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.790\nBut if you go ahead and\n\n227\n00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:11.680\nstore company information on that phone,\nyou will need to update your phone.\n\n228\n00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.840\nOtherwise, we'll go ahead and quarantine\nyou we'll move you to like a dmz,\n\n229\n00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.780\nget you off our production network and\n\n230\n00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.670\nstop using it in that manner\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt Cherokeem that this is\n\n231\n00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:26.740\none of the hardest aspects of\nactually using that nature of BYOD,\n\n232\n00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.130\nBring Your Own Device.\n\n233\n00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:32.970\nThe reason why is most end users are not\nat that level where they've paid attention\n\n234\n00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:37.840\nthat much to things like patching as well\nas the idea of security polices, and\n\n235\n00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.680\neven the feature of remote wipe.\n\n236\n00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.040\nThese are all great things that\ncan really help out a company, but\n\n237\n00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.050\nmost people that are now onboarding,\nthey don't understand that process.\n\n238\n00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:51.880\nSo, what ends up happening with a lot of\ncompanies instead is that they choose to\n\n239\n00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:56.660\nmanage these devices using, well, some\ntype of third party software that will\n\n240\n00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:01.650\nallow them to put some app on the phone\nthat will help them to control that and\n\n241\n00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:03.270\nbe able to push out the patches and\n\n242\n00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.760\nbe able to do the remote wipe, be able to\ndo all these features and control it, and\n\n243\n00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.710\nverify that everything is\nworking the way they need to.\n\n244\n00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:11.860\nBut it's part of that\nprocess of onboarding.\n\n245\n00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:15.170\nThe other part of it of course\nis the idea of offboarding.\n\n246\n00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.900\nWhat happens with that phone\nwhen they leave the company.\n\n247\n00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:18.860\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n248\n00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:23.725\n&gt;&gt; And so Cherokee, if you were,\nI hope this doesn't happen, if you were to\n\n249\n00:13:23.725 --> 00:13:28.599\nleave ITProTV and you had your phone and\ngo man that stuff is on there.\n\n250\n00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.026\nThe very fact is you might have\ncompany data on there, and\n\n251\n00:13:30.026 --> 00:13:30.722\nwhat would we do with that?\n\n252\n00:13:30.722 --> 00:13:34.410\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, there should be a process for\nthat, there really should.\n\n253\n00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.130\nAnd so this should be the responsibility\nof the IT department and\n\n254\n00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:38.970\nthey should go through\nan offboarding process.\n\n255\n00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.500\nYou might have an exit interview or\nsomething like that.\n\n256\n00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.100\nBut you bring up a good point when\nyou talk about that onboarding.\n\n257\n00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.960\nAnd installing a persistent agent, some\nkind of software solution to go ahead and\n\n258\n00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.440\nmonitor that device to make\nsure it stays in compliance to\n\n259\n00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.760\nthat health policy that\nyou have set forth.\n\n260\n00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.680\nNow, when you go to leave the company,\nwell, maybe you have some\n\n261\n00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.690\nkind of removable storage and you've kind\nof like pulled an Edward Snowdon and\n\n262\n00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:05.120\nyou're trying to siphon all this\ninformation outside of your network.\n\n263\n00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.390\nWell, in order to prevent that you might\nhave an inspection that you need to go\n\n264\n00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.870\nthrough through that offboarding\nprocess to make sure that well,\n\n265\n00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.870\nthat intellectual property is not\nleaving the corporate environment.\n\n266\n00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:18.600\nAnd it's really a concern\nthat needs to be addressed.\n\n267\n00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.350\nAnd so as long as you guys\ncover this ahead of time and\n\n268\n00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.770\nit's not a surprise to that end user\nwhen they're leaving the company.\n\n269\n00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:27.000\nBecause that's not a good\ntime to start initiating any\n\n270\n00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.940\nnew [LAUGH] conversations or\nsurprises at that time.\n\n271\n00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.850\nSo, it should just be clearly\nset forth ahead of time and\n\n272\n00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:37.390\nyou should have a policy in place for\noffboarding.\n\n273\n00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.220\nNow, also with\nthe onboarding process let's\n\n274\n00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.700\nsay that I work with a really\nsecure environment, high security.\n\n275\n00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.340\nNow, most of these devices\nhave integrated cameras and\n\n276\n00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:50.770\nof course they hae integrated microphones\nbecause that's how we speak and use them.\n\n277\n00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:54.230\nSo, a lot of companies if they're really\nhigh security they're just going to\n\n278\n00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:58.750\nsay look,\nwe're gonna either have to somehow disable\n\n279\n00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:03.220\nthose options or you're not gonna be\nable to bring these devices in at all.\n\n280\n00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.380\nSo, just depending on individual\nenvironment, some companies\n\n281\n00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.530\nare more relaxed and you know there's not\nanything we need to be concerned with.\n\n282\n00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:11.790\nIt just depends on that environment.\n\n283\n00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.520\nAnd you also need to think\nabout the architecture or\n\n284\n00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.850\nthe infrastructure of\nthat individual network.\n\n285\n00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.766\nMaybe my company doesn't\nhave enough bandwidth or\n\n286\n00:15:20.766 --> 00:15:25.193\nenough wireless access points for\nall of these devices that are connecting.\n\n287\n00:15:25.193 --> 00:15:28.183\nSo, you really need to take that\ninto consideration as well.\n\n288\n00:15:28.183 --> 00:15:31.570\nAnd not just the amount of\nsaturation of devices, but\n\n289\n00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.720\nyou also need to think about what\nare they doing on those devices?\n\n290\n00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.592\nSo, if they're streaming video and things\nlike that, that's going to be consuming\n\n291\n00:15:39.592 --> 00:15:43.005\na lot more bandwidth, than perhaps\nyour access points could even handle.\n\n292\n00:15:43.005 --> 00:15:47.508\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you might also end up seeing\nhere when we start taking a look at\n\n293\n00:15:47.508 --> 00:15:52.565\nthe architecture and infrastructure,\nit could also be how do those devices\n\n294\n00:15:52.565 --> 00:15:57.543\nend up authenticating if they're only\nconnecting wirelessly Are we gonna\n\n295\n00:15:57.543 --> 00:16:01.967\nuse something like 802.1x or\nare we actually going to require\n\n296\n00:16:01.967 --> 00:16:06.728\nsome type of password authentication\nthat's actually going to work?\n\n297\n00:16:06.728 --> 00:16:10.080\nIs it gonna be some radius of\nwhatever else might be there?\n\n298\n00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.320\nWe might find out that\neverything is not set up yet\n\n299\n00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.400\nto handle everybody's connections\nin the way that they need to.\n\n300\n00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.550\nSo this is where you might\nfind the limitation once again\n\n301\n00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.070\nabout which devices connect in.\n\n302\n00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:27.890\nWe found some issues at times where we had\ncertain types of wireless access points,\n\n303\n00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:30.940\nand certain phones just\ndid not want connect and\n\n304\n00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:34.180\nuse them the way that all the other\nphones wanted to do that.\n\n305\n00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:37.310\nAnd then we switched, and then it\nactually worked fine for some phones, but\n\n306\n00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:38.840\nnot the other ones.\n\n307\n00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:43.080\nSo you end up finding that there's\na lot of different little nuances,\n\n308\n00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.760\nas far as infrastructure\narchitecture goes to.\n\n309\n00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.200\nAnd also on the phones today,\nthe great thing is,\n\n310\n00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:53.540\nsince everybody's moved to the 64\nbit types of operating systems,\n\n311\n00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:56.350\nit really helps out in terms\nof memory usage as well.\n\n312\n00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:00.340\nThere is not a lot of phones that I know\nof today that may even be going back to\n\n313\n00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:05.110\nthe 32-bit anymore, but overall though it\ndoes help because it actually increases\n\n314\n00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:08.590\nthe amount of resources that\nwe can use on that phone.\n\n315\n00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:11.090\nTo be able to handle some\nof the applications, okay?\n\n316\n00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:15.570\nNow Cherokee let's briefly mention\nthis idea of legal concerns.\n\n317\n00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:17.379\nWhat are we looking at in\nterms of legal concerns?\n\n318\n00:17:17.379 --> 00:17:21.573\n&gt;&gt; It really depends on the region\nof where you're located, and so\n\n319\n00:17:21.573 --> 00:17:25.860\nFlorida is a right to work state,\nand there might be some kind of.\n\n320\n00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.970\nIt's always a very good idea to be very\ntransparent with your end-users, and so\n\n321\n00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:34.930\nmy take is go ahead and define that\nin your corporate security policy,\n\n322\n00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.320\nsay hey look, we have some security\ncameras in the break rooms or whatever.\n\n323\n00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.270\nBut you're not gonna be able to\ngo ahead at least here in Florida\n\n324\n00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:46.070\nto install any kind of monitoring\nlike spyware on these phones so\n\n325\n00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.090\nyou could be eavesdropping or\nlistening to them.\n\n326\n00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:52.390\nIn Florida, it's actually a felony to\nrecord someone without their consent or\n\n327\n00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:53.160\nknowledge.\n\n328\n00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.090\nSo, you wanna make sure that you're\nnot entering into that realm and\n\n329\n00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.400\nget yourself in trouble there.\n\n330\n00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.701\nYou need to go ahead and,\n\n331\n00:17:59.701 --> 00:18:04.090\nend users have an implied level of\nprivacy and you want to respect that.\n\n332\n00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.200\nSo you might have some kind\nof industry regulations but\n\n333\n00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.610\nyou always wanna make sure you're\nfollowing everything by the book there.\n\n334\n00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.310\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really one of the strangest\nand one of the most ambiguous types of\n\n335\n00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:19.520\nthings that we have to deal with,\nin terms of the IT infrastructure and\n\n336\n00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.490\nthe idea of ownership also\ncomes into that realm as well.\n\n337\n00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.960\nSeveral years ago,\nit was out in California,\n\n338\n00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:31.010\nthere was a fire department chief,\nI believe,\n\n339\n00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:35.540\nthat ended up essentially texting his\nmistress is what he ended up doing.\n\n340\n00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.440\nBut he did it on the company phone.\n\n341\n00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:37.970\n&gt;&gt; Smart [LAUGH].\n\n342\n00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.700\n&gt;&gt; Yet, when they fired him for it,\n\n343\n00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.920\nhe sued back saying you can't fire me for\na private text message.\n\n344\n00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.280\nAnd you know, it went back and forth.\n\n345\n00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:50.330\nAnd finally the judge said well,\ndid you use company resources to do that?\n\n346\n00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:54.600\nAnd said yes, but he says but the message\nwas private so, you know, you and\n\n347\n00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.500\nI might think that's clear, cut, and dry.\n\n348\n00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.720\nBut he had some legal argument and\nit did end up going to court so\n\n349\n00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.150\nin this particular aspect, you never know.\n\n350\n00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:08.310\nEven as clear as the law may be\nsomebody always has a nuance on that.\n\n351\n00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:12.750\nSo you want to be as clear as possible\non what the legal ramifications are for\n\n352\n00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:18.260\nusing things like the phone, you know,\nand being able to do private messages.\n\n353\n00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.300\nCan your employer take a look at\nall the emails that are there?\n\n354\n00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.300\nAnd usually, it is.\n\n355\n00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.460\nIf the employer provides that, anything\nthey want to, they pretty much have access\n\n356\n00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.180\nto on your phone,\neven if you do have private data there.\n\n357\n00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.970\nSo, just kind of be aware that\nyou might see that as well.\n\n358\n00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.640\nAnd what,\n&gt;&gt; That brings up a huge topic because\n\n359\n00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.910\nit's such a great debate right now.\n\n360\n00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:37.958\nI mean, look at our government.\n\n361\n00:19:37.958 --> 00:19:42.253\nWe had with, what was it,\nthe San Bernardino shootings,\n\n362\n00:19:42.253 --> 00:19:44.700\nthe FBI Director James Comey.\n\n363\n00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.510\nHe said that the FBI paid, okay,\n\n364\n00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:53.080\na hacker to go ahead and\nhack into that shooter's iPhone.\n\n365\n00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.722\nAnd they paid him, James said it was over\nhis salary and he's been with the FBI for\n\n366\n00:19:57.722 --> 00:20:01.487\nseven years,\nwhich means he makes more than $180,000.\n\n367\n00:20:01.487 --> 00:20:06.312\nSo they paid this hacker to go ahead and\ndevelop a software tool for\n\n368\n00:20:06.312 --> 00:20:11.049\nthe FBI to go ahead and\naccess the information on this device, so\n\n369\n00:20:11.049 --> 00:20:15.990\nand it caused a really big public\ndebate about privacy issues.\n\n370\n00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:20.020\nSo I think that's something that we're\ngonna be continuing to see in the future.\n\n371\n00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:25.834\nAnd learning how to segregate and\ncompartmentalize our data on these devices\n\n372\n00:20:25.834 --> 00:20:32.108\nis something that very few companies are\nreally have solidified this concept yet.\n\n373\n00:20:32.108 --> 00:20:35.311\nThey are starting to, they see the need\nfor it and we'll talk about those.\n\n374\n00:20:35.311 --> 00:20:38.617\nWhat else do we have here,\nlet's go ahead and\n\n375\n00:20:38.617 --> 00:20:42.371\nwe'll show you now one way\nthat we can take a phone.\n\n376\n00:20:42.371 --> 00:20:47.560\nLet's take a look at this phone here and\nencrypt, provide full disk encryption.\n\n377\n00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.968\nWell, I'm saying disc encryption, but\nfull device encryption on this phone.\n\n378\n00:20:51.968 --> 00:20:56.004\nThis is Ronnie's phone here, so he's\nshared his phone for use with us today,\n\n379\n00:20:56.004 --> 00:20:56.992\nappreciate that.\n\n380\n00:20:56.992 --> 00:21:01.962\nAnd, now most devices will allow you\nto provide full device encryption.\n\n381\n00:21:01.962 --> 00:21:07.850\nWith your iOS operating system,\nit was iOS 5 and above.\n\n382\n00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:09.510\nApple does things a little different.\n\n383\n00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:11.370\nImagine that, right.\n\n384\n00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:16.231\nThey do not actually do full device\nencryption, some things like contacts,\n\n385\n00:21:16.231 --> 00:21:19.240\nSMS messages,\na few others are not encrypted.\n\n386\n00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.871\nSo it's a little bit different there but\nwith our Android device here we just go\n\n387\n00:21:23.871 --> 00:21:28.650\nahead and click that home button and\nvoila, I have access to this system.\n\n388\n00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:33.370\nBut similarly also with the IOS\ndevices you can go ahead and\n\n389\n00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:39.080\nuse a lock or a pass phrase\nlike a pin number to go ahead\n\n390\n00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.300\nand add another layer of security here.\n\n391\n00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.724\nSo if we go into Ronnie's phone here and\n\n392\n00:21:43.724 --> 00:21:47.845\njust give me a second here,\nit's all ready asking me for my pin.\n\n393\n00:21:47.845 --> 00:21:48.448\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n394\n00:21:48.448 --> 00:21:50.827\nIt's all nines\n&gt;&gt; All nine's okay.\n\n395\n00:21:50.827 --> 00:21:52.428\nAll right guys, take note of this.\n\n396\n00:21:52.428 --> 00:21:54.623\n&gt;&gt; It's okay I wiped it clean.\n\n397\n00:21:54.623 --> 00:21:55.139\n&gt;&gt; Okay so\n\n398\n00:21:55.139 --> 00:21:58.640\nwe'll go ahead the home page here\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n399\n00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.240\nunder Settings,\nwhich way is Settings here.\n\n400\n00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.787\nSorry, I do not.\n\n401\n00:22:02.787 --> 00:22:05.257\n&gt;&gt; Apps.\n&gt;&gt; Have Apps, and then Settings, sorry.\n\n402\n00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:08.707\nAll right, so if we go under Lock and\n\n403\n00:22:08.707 --> 00:22:13.880\nScreen Security, and\nthat will be Secure Startup.\n\n404\n00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:18.375\nIt says, protect your device by using\na screen lock when your device turns on.\n\n405\n00:22:18.375 --> 00:22:20.610\nSo we'll go ahead and choose this option.\n\n406\n00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:23.700\nSo Ronnie's already configured\nhis PIN number, we just saw that.\n\n407\n00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:28.740\nSo now, let's change this radio button to\nRequire a PIN when the device turns on.\n\n408\n00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:33.354\nWe'll hit OK, and\nthe current PIN, all right.\n\n409\n00:22:35.131 --> 00:22:39.287\nAnd we'll need to go ahead and\nrestart this device so\n\n410\n00:22:39.287 --> 00:22:41.845\nyou guys can see that in action.\n\n411\n00:22:41.845 --> 00:22:43.180\n&gt;&gt; Hit that button again.\n\n412\n00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.063\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n413\n00:22:44.063 --> 00:22:46.028\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n414\n00:22:46.028 --> 00:22:47.847\nwhat are we really seeing here?\n\n415\n00:22:47.847 --> 00:22:51.819\nOkay, what it's actually gonna require is\nfor the device to be able to boot into\n\n416\n00:22:51.819 --> 00:22:55.280\nthe operating system itself,\nit's gonna require that PIN number.\n\n417\n00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.998\nNow, I could have set it up for\na finger swipe.\n\n418\n00:22:56.998 --> 00:23:00.580\nI could have set it up to actually\nuse a password if I wanted to.\n\n419\n00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.380\nBut this actually now is taking the\nprocess of encrypting and so what we're\n\n420\n00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:08.500\ngonna end up seeing is that without that,\nright you won't be able to get access in.\n\n421\n00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.070\nSo while it's actually booting up\nwe'll take a look at it again.\n\n422\n00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.860\nWe'll see the process of it actually now\n\n423\n00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.060\nusing this once we get\npast a few screens here.\n\n424\n00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.120\nBut that's what's happening.\n\n425\n00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:22.730\nNow, if you're used to seeing things\nlike BitLocker inside of Windows,\n\n426\n00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:25.000\nit's pretty much doing the same thing.\n\n427\n00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.653\nNow, at this point here It's\na little bit hard to read, but\n\n428\n00:23:27.653 --> 00:23:29.951\nCherokee what does that\nactually say right there?\n\n429\n00:23:29.951 --> 00:23:33.510\n&gt;&gt; It says enter PIN to\ndecrypt device storage.\n\n430\n00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:36.600\nSo instead of just fully\nloading like we saw before,\n\n431\n00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.780\nor booting up, we have to go ahead and\ninput that PIN.\n\n432\n00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.090\nOtherwise the information\nwould stay encrypted so\n\n433\n00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:44.960\nthat if I had stolen this from your,\nwhatever.\n\n434\n00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.990\nI shouldn't have access\nto that information.\n\n435\n00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:49.849\nNow it's not a 100% full proof,\nlike we just talk about.\n\n436\n00:23:49.849 --> 00:23:53.470\nThere, the FBI had to go ahead and\nhire someone to do that.\n\n437\n00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:56.805\nBut that is one way, you always You\nhave this option available to you.\n\n438\n00:23:56.805 --> 00:23:58.990\nI don't wanna say always because\nthere are some drawbacks.\n\n439\n00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:02.092\nYou might notice some kind\nof lag with the performance,\n\n440\n00:24:02.092 --> 00:24:04.870\nbecause we'll we're\ndealing with encryption.\n\n441\n00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:06.179\nIt's kind of a trade-off there.\n\n442\n00:24:06.179 --> 00:24:07.635\nBut if you were to just go ahead and\n\n443\n00:24:07.635 --> 00:24:13.619\nput your PIN number in here,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the advantage that you're\n\n444\n00:24:13.619 --> 00:24:17.050\nseeing here, notice that it just said\nstarting and now you see the lock, right?\n\n445\n00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.290\nIt's showing you that now\nit's unlocking this but\n\n446\n00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:23.160\nit works in the similar fashion like\nI said with the idea of bitlocker.\n\n447\n00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.700\nWhen the device is off,\nit's encrypting the entire device itself.\n\n448\n00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.320\nWhen it's on of course, if you can use it,\n\n449\n00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:30.730\nit's going to decrypt it so\nit can be used.\n\n450\n00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:34.840\nBut every single file on there is now\nencrypted when the device is off.\n\n451\n00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.950\nWhy does that help?\n\n452\n00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:39.670\nBecause if somebody ends up stealing\nthis phone, if the battery dies or\n\n453\n00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:44.650\nif I can actually just send\na message to reboot remotely, well,\n\n454\n00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:47.880\nit's gonna end up giving that screen\nwhere they'll have to go ahead and\n\n455\n00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.740\nbe able to,\n&gt;&gt; Know that pin.\n\n456\n00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.820\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, to know that pin to get back in.\n\n457\n00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.230\nIf not, they have gotten away with\nthe device, which is crummy enough.\n\n458\n00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:58.590\nBut overall though, at least they\ndon't have access to the data.\n\n459\n00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:00.870\nSo Cherokee, we're now in.\n\n460\n00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:02.420\nWhat else are we gonna\ntake a look at here?\n\n461\n00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you just brought\nup a really good point there,\n\n462\n00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:09.740\nRonnie, was if I were to go ahead and\nbe able to remote restart that device.\n\n463\n00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:14.380\nBut what if I had my device set to auto\nlock after a certain amount of time,\n\n464\n00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.930\nlike five minutes to adjust\ngo to the screen saver and\n\n465\n00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:20.420\nthen you would have to input that\npin to go ahead and unlock it?\n\n466\n00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.920\nSo funny story my son actually\ndid this to my mother one day.\n\n467\n00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.914\nKids when they're younger,\nI will give them a toy to play with.\n\n468\n00:25:26.914 --> 00:25:31.110\nWell a cell phone,\nthey love it not so much a toy.\n\n469\n00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:34.599\nWhat happened was,\nall great stories start with that line,\n\n470\n00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:40.260\nhe ended up locking her out of her phone\nand she had to perform a factory reset\n\n471\n00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:44.640\nbecause he had that so many failed or\nunsuccessful log in attempts.\n\n472\n00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.870\nIt can happen.\n\n473\n00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:48.783\nThere are settings that you\ncan go ahead and change and\n\n474\n00:25:48.783 --> 00:25:50.531\nthe concept is to really deter,\n\n475\n00:25:50.531 --> 00:25:55.146\nlet's say Ronnie went to the rest room or\nwent outside or went outside or something.\n\n476\n00:25:55.146 --> 00:25:57.785\nI grabbed his phone and\nI'm gonna try to guess his password.\n\n477\n00:25:57.785 --> 00:26:01.135\nI'm like I know Ronnie's birthday, maybe\nhe put that or the year he was born or\n\n478\n00:26:01.135 --> 00:26:02.091\nsomething like that.\n\n479\n00:26:02.091 --> 00:26:04.269\nAnd after five, it might lock me up for\n\n480\n00:26:04.269 --> 00:26:08.762\na period of five minutes with the notion\nthat, by the time Ronnie get's back,\n\n481\n00:26:08.762 --> 00:26:12.460\nlooks for his phone,\nTurkey wasn't able to go and park into it.\n\n482\n00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:16.849\nSo you just want to check your device\nto see if there's a particular lock out\n\n483\n00:26:16.849 --> 00:26:21.251\nsetting that you can go ahead and\nkind of figure to ahead and perform there.\n\n484\n00:26:21.251 --> 00:26:24.333\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, this idea is actually is\none of the very important aspects\n\n485\n00:26:24.333 --> 00:26:27.130\nthat you'll end up seeing,\nbut even on a personal level,\n\n486\n00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:30.690\nit's actually worth making sure\nyou have this encryption on.\n\n487\n00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:34.940\nEspecially if you know that there's data\non, that's sensitive that you need to do.\n\n488\n00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.387\nBut also of course then, that means\nthe other things that you can do is,\n\n489\n00:26:38.387 --> 00:26:41.150\nthere's more things that you\ncan do to help secure this.\n\n490\n00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:45.114\nBut with the idea here of bring\nyour own device concerns,\n\n491\n00:26:45.114 --> 00:26:50.496\nthis is one of the key ways that a company\nmight say here's what our policy is.\n\n492\n00:26:50.496 --> 00:26:54.433\nLet's go ahead and make sure that we\nwill set this type of encryption,\n\n493\n00:26:54.433 --> 00:26:56.770\nwhich is the entire device encryption and\n\n494\n00:26:56.770 --> 00:27:01.659\nthen along with that idea that persistent\nagent that Cherokee was mentioning before.\n\n495\n00:27:01.659 --> 00:27:05.362\nIt really is of combination that's\nat least at the service level,\n\n496\n00:27:05.362 --> 00:27:09.794\na very powerful way that we can control\nthe device and that's what we're really\n\n497\n00:27:09.794 --> 00:27:13.690\nlooking for is at least the basic\ncontrol of the device itself.\n\n498\n00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:17.876\nI'm not talking about the way that the\napplications work or anything else, but\n\n499\n00:27:17.876 --> 00:27:21.139\nthat device itself is now pretty\ndecent in terms of security.\n\n500\n00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:23.319\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and\nI know we're getting shorter on time but\n\n501\n00:27:23.319 --> 00:27:24.850\nI wanna show you a cool new feature.\n\n502\n00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:26.960\nI'm kind of excited about.\n\n503\n00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:27.910\nI got an Apple Watch.\n\n504\n00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:30.830\nSo, let me go ahead and pull up my phone.\n\n505\n00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:33.670\nIt really,\nI'll put it right next to Ronny's here.\n\n506\n00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:36.190\nBut if we take a look at the phones again,\nso\n\n507\n00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:40.330\nI got an Apple Watch, and I am so\nbad about losing my phone.\n\n508\n00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:41.980\nI don't know if you guys\nare like that at all.\n\n509\n00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:47.820\nBut a really cool feature is, if I lose my\nphone or if I suspect that it was stolen,\n\n510\n00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:53.490\nyou can go ahead and do perform a,\nlike a remote call to that device.\n\n511\n00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:58.490\nSo, if I just go ahead and\nswipe up, I can press this button.\n\n512\n00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:59.340\nI don't know if you guys see it.\n\n513\n00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:04.220\nIt's the little phone button there, and\nit'll send an audible ping to my device.\n\n514\n00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:07.854\nSo, hopefully I can hear it and find it.\n\n515\n00:28:07.854 --> 00:28:10.667\n[SOUND] So that's pretty cool.\n\n516\n00:28:10.667 --> 00:28:13.100\nI use that feature quite a bit.\n\n517\n00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.812\nThere are other solutions out there.\n\n518\n00:28:14.812 --> 00:28:16.960\nAnd, I'll actually pull that up and\nshow you on my screen.\n\n519\n00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.840\nRonnie had mentioned a year,\n\n520\n00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:23.270\ncorporate environment may\nhave something a little more\n\n521\n00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:27.230\ncomprehensive where they're controlling\nand configuring those policies.\n\n522\n00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.840\nBut even from a personal stand point,\nthere are different solutions out there.\n\n523\n00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.274\nThis one is called Lookout.\n\n524\n00:28:32.274 --> 00:28:36.036\nIt's an application that you can go ahead\nand I think hey have a free version and\n\n525\n00:28:36.036 --> 00:28:37.630\na paid version.\n\n526\n00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:41.074\n&gt;&gt; So, When I first found out\nabout this particular application,\n\n527\n00:28:41.074 --> 00:28:45.910\nNot all devices had these integrated\nsecurity features that they do now have.\n\n528\n00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:49.860\nSo I was checking this video out and\nyou guys can watch that later.\n\n529\n00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:54.510\nThis is just their website and\nthey also offer some other features,\n\n530\n00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:57.440\nalmost like an insurance to go ahead and\nback up.\n\n531\n00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:00.896\nI think it was like a million\ndollar policy stating that,\n\n532\n00:29:00.896 --> 00:29:04.580\nit's preventing identity theft and\nthings of that nature.\n\n533\n00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.643\nThey're saying look if\nyou use this device,\n\n534\n00:29:06.643 --> 00:29:09.730\nwe're gonna take extra steps\nto secure your information.\n\n535\n00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:13.530\nYou can go ahead and\nuse things like remote wiping or\n\n536\n00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:16.110\nsending an audible sound\nif you lose your device.\n\n537\n00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:19.180\nSo there are a lot of different\nsolutions available to you.\n\n538\n00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:23.126\nAnd we'll take a look at some others that\nhad integrated right into device into\n\n539\n00:29:23.126 --> 00:29:26.900\nthe device..But yeah get to know you\nare with it because these devices really\n\n540\n00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.110\nare gonna be going away any time soon\n&gt;&gt; A lot of time you can also end at\n\n541\n00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:34.920\nseeing like for example on an android\nphone you may have know you have to create\n\n542\n00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:39.200\na google account for to be able to work\nand this allows you of course to connect\n\n543\n00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:43.850\nto, well, Google's infrastructure of the\nway that they set up things on security.\n\n544\n00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:47.100\nSo, one of the neat features just\nlike what Cherokee showed you,\n\n545\n00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:50.480\nwhere she could actually\nuse her Apple watch\n\n546\n00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.820\nto be able to send that message\nover to her phone to make it ring.\n\n547\n00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:57.950\nWell, inside of the way that\nthe Google app account works and\n\n548\n00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:03.060\nI have it now connected to my phone, I can\nactually go to the Google website itself\n\n549\n00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.570\nand there's an option there,\nI don't remember exactly where it is, but\n\n550\n00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:06.230\nit tells you that-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n551\n00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.820\n&gt;&gt; They can send\n\n552\n00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.280\na piercing-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n553\n00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:08.880\n&gt;&gt; Sound.\n\n554\n00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:13.270\nIt will send a very annoying sound for\nmultiple minutes.\n\n555\n00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:17.710\nThat way you're alerting not\nonly that phone there, but\n\n556\n00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:19.340\nif somebody has taken off with it.\n\n557\n00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.350\nAnd within just a few minutes,\n\n558\n00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:21.240\nif you can get access\n&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool.\n\n559\n00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.920\n&gt;&gt; Access to another device.\n\n560\n00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.180\nIt will almost audibly, apparently,\n\n561\n00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:30.990\nscream at you to the point where\nit's gonna be very annoying and\n\n562\n00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:34.550\nvery easy for people to know, ooh,\nthat guy probably has a stolen device.\n\n563\n00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:35.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So very\n\n564\n00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:36.355\nmuch, very-\n&gt;&gt; I [INAUDIBLE]\n\n565\n00:30:36.355 --> 00:30:37.085\n&gt;&gt; Need audible signals, yeah.\n\n566\n00:30:37.085 --> 00:30:39.215\n&gt;&gt; I've heard quite a few stories\nof people, even with Apple devices,\n\n567\n00:30:39.215 --> 00:30:44.985\nyou can use your find my i-device feature,\nso iPads, with your iOS operating system,\n\n568\n00:30:44.985 --> 00:30:47.095\nand they've been successful\nat recovering those,\n\n569\n00:30:47.095 --> 00:30:50.385\nif the GPS features have been enabled and\nyou go ahead and use that.\n\n570\n00:30:50.385 --> 00:30:54.015\nSo that's pretty cool .s\n&gt;&gt; All right, Cherokee, well, there's\n\n571\n00:30:54.015 --> 00:30:58.875\na lot of information for us in mobile\nsecurity, and we really only touched\n\n572\n00:30:58.875 --> 00:31:02.280\na little bit of it, which means we're\ngonna come back for a part two, Cherokee.\n\n573\n00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.865\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we had to reach out for\na part two here.\n\n574\n00:31:04.865 --> 00:31:06.140\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, well,\n\n575\n00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.890\ndon't forget that what you took a look at\nhere is we took a look at the idea here\n\n576\n00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:13.860\nof bring your own device types\nof concerns that companies and\n\n577\n00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.000\nof course individuals need to worry about.\n\n578\n00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.060\nWe also took a look at some\nof the security features and\n\n579\n00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:22.190\nhow those things can really help out\nin terms of the full device encryption\n\n580\n00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:24.860\nThat's some of the notifications\nwe can set in place.\n\n581\n00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.850\nBut since we're coming back for a Part 2,\n\n582\n00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:31.550\nthat means that we're gonna save the rest\nof our show here for that as well and\n\n583\n00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:34.310\nthat means it's a great place for\nus to sign off.\n\n584\n00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:37.560\nSo, for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n585\n00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.820\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n586\n00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:42.819\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned here for\nmore CompTIA Security+.\n\n587\n00:31:42.819 --> 00:31:49.151\n[MUSIC]\n\n588\n00:31:49.151 --> 00:31:51.640\nThank you for watching ITIPRO.TV.\n\n",

00:00:37,870\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,591\nI'm your host Don Pezet\nback with Mr Nate Copeland.\n\n5\n00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:41,600\nHow's it going, Nate?\n\n6\n00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,100\n>> Pretty good, Don.\n\n7\n00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,060\nIt's going going pretty well today.\n\n8\n00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,540\n>> So Jason, our director,\nspecifically told me before the show.\n\n9\n00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,451\nHe said, Don, don't wear your\nbrown vest cuz Nate's wearing his.\n\n10\n00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,368\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It looks goofy when\n\n11\n00:00:52,368 --> 00:00:52,992\nyou wear the same one.\n\n12\n00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,120\nAnd you know what I said?\n\n13\n00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,675\nI said I don't care.\n\n14\n00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:55,210\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n15\n00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,100\n>> I'm wearing it.\n\n16\n00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,980\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,820\n>> Well I only have a brown vest on.\n\n18\n00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,390\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n19\n00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,230\n>> So, it's, it's gonna be up\nto you to to change it out.\n\n20\n00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,255\n>> I'm the one with choices, huh?\n\n21\n00:01:03,255 --> 00:01:06,365\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, well enough about vests.\n\n22\n00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:07,110\n[LAUGH].\n\n23\n00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,100\nLet's get back into\nthe wonderful world of security.\n\n24\n00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,670\nSo we're going to be doing another\nepisode of Security Plus today.\n\n25\n00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,752\nAnd, we're gonna be diving into a, a\npretty important area, access control and\n\n26\n00:01:16,752 --> 00:01:17,950\nidentity management.\n\n27\n00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,600\nIn all of the previous objectives,\none through four,\n\n28\n00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,890\nyou're talking about security controls,\nthings you can do to stop\n\n29\n00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,270\npeople from getting into areas they\nshouldn't be able to get into.\n\n30\n00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,480\nSo in this section, we're gonna look at\nsome of the specific technologies that\n\n31\n00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,320\nare available inside of\nthe computing world that we can use.\n\n32\n00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,850\nSo we're gonna, we're gonna set\naside thoughts of security guards,\n\n33\n00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,670\nand physical door locks,\nand security cameras, and\n\n34\n00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,140\nwe're gonna focus just on\nsome technical controls.\n\n35\n00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,529\nControls that we can use inside of our,\nour servers, our work stations, and\n\n36\n00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:52,074\nour other computerized systems, right?\n\n37\n00:01:52,074 --> 00:01:54,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now one of the key components,\n\n38\n00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,650\nif you want to keep people out\nof areas they shouldn't be in,\n\n39\n00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,320\nis you need to know who those people are.\n\n40\n00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,820\nYou can't filter people if\nyou don't know who they are.\n\n41\n00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:09,260\nSo every modern security system requires\nsome sort of authentication, all right?\n\n42\n00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,300\nNow we're really gonna talk about\na couple of different concepts here.\n\n43\n00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,100\nAuthentication and\nauthorization are the two main ones, and\n\n44\n00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,580\nit's really easy to mix these things up.\n\n45\n00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,970\nSo let's just kind of, kinda cover real\nhigh level what those are before we dive\n\n46\n00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,980\ninto all this other stuff, all right?\n\n47\n00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:30,280\nAuthentication is proving that\nsomeone is who they say they are.\n\n48\n00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,710\nSo I say hey, I'm,\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n49\n00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,580\nHow do you know that I'm Don Pezet?\n\n50\n00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,210\nWell, how do I authenticate with you\nto let you know that I am Don Pezet?\n\n51\n00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,370\nI could show you my driver's license,\nwhich has a picture on it and\n\n52\n00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,290\nits issued by the state and the state\nwould never make a mistake, right?\n\n53\n00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,800\nSo, so I, I obviously am who I say I am.\n\n54\n00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,190\nOr I have my birth certificate, or\n\n55\n00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,770\nI have some information in\nmy head that I tell you.\n\n56\n00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,020\nI answer some questions about my history.\n\n57\n00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,890\nAnd that's how you authenticate\nthat I am who I say I am.\n\n58\n00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,390\nBut you don't wanna go through that\nevery time you turn on your computer.\n\n59\n00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,330\nSo we need some other system to\nbe able to handle authentication,\n\n60\n00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,995\nand that's typically done through\nusername and password combinations.\n\n61\n00:03:09,995 --> 00:03:13,215\nWe, we'll talk about some alternatives\nlater, but it's typically a user name and\n\n62\n00:03:13,215 --> 00:03:15,005\npassword combination.\n\n63\n00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:17,175\nThat's authentication.\n\n64\n00:03:17,175 --> 00:03:19,375\nAuthorization is the next piece.\n\n65\n00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:20,825\nAn authorization is saying hey,\n\n66\n00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:25,025\nwhen somebody connects,\nthey prove they are who they say the are.\n\n67\n00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:29,045\nSo now that we know who they are,\nwhat are they allowed to do?\n\n68\n00:03:29,045 --> 00:03:31,575\nWhat are you authorized to access?\n\n69\n00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:33,850\nAre you allowed to access this file share?\n\n70\n00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,340\nIf so, are you allowed to read files,\nor write files, or both, right?\n\n71\n00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,540\nAre you allowed to delete files and\ncreate files?\n\n72\n00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,470\nWhat, what is it that\nyou're allowed to do?\n\n73\n00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,130\nThat's authorization.\n\n74\n00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,960\nSo auth, authentication and\nauthorization go hand and hand, and\n\n75\n00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,970\nthe words are really similar,\nso it's easy to mix them up.\n\n76\n00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,830\nAnd when you're reading on the exam,\nit's easy to read over them real fast, and\n\n77\n00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,820\nmix up one for the other, all right?\n\n78\n00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,425\nAnd some of the questions will be\nspecifically worded to make that happen.\n\n79\n00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:03,410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, you know, are you paying attention?\n\n80\n00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,980\nDo you really know the difference?\n\n81\n00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,810\nSo authentication,\nproving someone is who they say they are.\n\n82\n00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,998\nAuthorization, figuring out\nwhat they're allowed to do,\n\n83\n00:04:12,998 --> 00:04:15,633\nwhat they're authorized to access,\nall right?\n\n84\n00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:20,436\nNow often times we'll couple a, a third, I\nguess it's not a couple a that point, but\n\n85\n00:04:20,436 --> 00:04:22,669\nwe, we add [LAUGH] a third entry to that.\n\n86\n00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:24,900\nWhich is accounting, okay?\n\n87\n00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,160\nAuthorization, or authentication,\nauthorization, and accounting.\n\n88\n00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,536\nAccounting is keeping\na record of what they did.\n\n89\n00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:34,718\nWhen they logged in,\n\n90\n00:04:34,718 --> 00:04:38,802\nwhen they logged out, what did they\naccess while they were in the system?\n\n91\n00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:39,810\nThat's accounting.\n\n92\n00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,200\nWe, we can also call it auditing.\n\n93\n00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,510\nSome people call it that.\n\n94\n00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,100\nBut, you most commonly hear\nit called accounting and\n\n95\n00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,540\nyou hear it referred to as triple A,\nright?\n\n96\n00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,740\nAuthentication, authorization,\nand accounting, all right?\n\n97\n00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,477\nNow, in the objectives,\nthey specifically call out identification\n\n98\n00:04:56,477 --> 00:05:00,582\nversus authentication versus\nauthorization, all right?\n\n99\n00:05:00,582 --> 00:05:06,004\nWell identification and authentication\nare very, very similar, all right?\n\n100\n00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:09,940\nBut identification can actually\nhappen without authentication.\n\n101\n00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,116\nWhat do, what do I mean by that,\nall right?\n\n102\n00:05:12,116 --> 00:05:15,377\nThis morning, I walked into the office and\nI saw Nate, right?\n\n103\n00:05:15,377 --> 00:05:17,847\nWhich, you know, I,\nI came in a little late today,\n\n104\n00:05:17,847 --> 00:05:21,178\notherwise I'm normally here well\nbefore Nate, cuz he's a slacker.\n\n105\n00:05:21,178 --> 00:05:21,758\n>> [LAUGH].\nAw, man.\n\n106\n00:05:21,758 --> 00:05:25,350\n>> But but when I came in and I saw Nate,\nI didn't need Nate to authenticate.\n\n107\n00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,513\nI didn't say, Nate,\nwhat's your mother's maiden name?\n\n108\n00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:28,908\n>> Oh, crap.\n>> Yeah, I dunno.\n\n109\n00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:29,742\nI don't care and.\n\n110\n00:05:29,742 --> 00:05:30,936\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And so,\n\n111\n00:05:30,936 --> 00:05:32,800\nI didn't have to quiz him.\n\n112\n00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,950\nI visually saw him and had\nthe information I needed to identify him.\n\n113\n00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,050\nI identified and\n\n114\n00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,220\nrecognized that he was who he said he\nwas without authenticating, all right?\n\n115\n00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,630\nYou do that in computers\non a regular basis.\n\n116\n00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,420\nWhen I first logged into my computer,\nI authenticated.\n\n117\n00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,490\nI provided a user name and password, but\n\n118\n00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,590\nnow I'm running it every time I launch\na program, it's identifying me.\n\n119\n00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,800\nIt's recognizing that I am who I am,\nbut it's not authenticating me again.\n\n120\n00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,710\nI'm not having to provide my user name and\npassword every time I watch a program.\n\n121\n00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,760\nI have an access token, and\n\n122\n00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,040\nthat access token is my identity,\nand I'm handing that off like crazy.\n\n123\n00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,430\nEvery program I run,\nevery time I access a file,\n\n124\n00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,420\nevery time I access a printer,\nI'm identify myself.\n\n125\n00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,700\nWhen you go to a website,\nwhen you go to IT Pro TV,\n\n126\n00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,300\nwhen you go to our website,\nyou login, that's you authenticating.\n\n127\n00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,640\nBut then every time you click a link\nyou're going to another page and\n\n128\n00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,330\nyou're having to re-authenticate.\n\n129\n00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,010\nBut you don't have to enter in you\nusername and password every time.\n\n130\n00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,810\nYou're identifying yourself\nwith a session token, right?\n\n131\n00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,490\nWe track who you are based\non your session ID.\n\n132\n00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,020\nAnd if your session ID gets reset,\n\n133\n00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,310\nthen yeah you'll have to\nlog back in again, right?\n\n134\n00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,090\nBut otherwise you continue to identify\nas you're in the system, right?\n\n135\n00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,330\nSo there's a couple of different\nthings that get tied in here that\n\n136\n00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,652\nget to be a little confusing.\n\n137\n00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:50,530\nSo you und, you need to understand,\nespecially for\n\n138\n00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,755\nthe exam, the nuances in-between\nthe three different types.\n\n139\n00:06:53,755 --> 00:06:55,560\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n140\n00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,690\n>> Alright, so let's take a look at,\nat how we do that.\n\n141\n00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,010\nWell, it's really different for\nevery system.\n\n142\n00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,810\nIf you're running Mac OS, if you're\nrunning Linux, if you're running Windows,\n\n143\n00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,150\nif you're running Solaris.\n\n144\n00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,620\nThey all have different\nauthentication mechanisms in place.\n\n145\n00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:15,700\nSo you need to identify which\nones work for your system, right?\n\n146\n00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,930\nWell, the Security Plus exam\nis fairly vendor neutral.\n\n147\n00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,620\nSo they try and\n\n148\n00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,870\nstay out of the proprietary stuff, but\nit's kind of hard to with authentication.\n\n149\n00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,970\nOne of the most popular\nmethods that's out there\n\n150\n00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,220\nis the Microsoft Windows Active Directory,\nall right?\n\n151\n00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,268\nThe Windows Active Directory is designed\nfor enterprise environments, and, and,\n\n152\n00:07:33,268 --> 00:07:37,660\nand even small environments can use it, to\nbe able to have a centralized database of\n\n153\n00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,310\nyour user accounts to\nauthenticate against.\n\n154\n00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,220\nWell, Microsoft didn't create\nthe Active Directory from scratch.\n\n155\n00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,064\nIt's actually built on top of an existing\ntechnology called Kerberos, allright?\n\n156\n00:07:49,064 --> 00:07:50,705\nOr Kerberos, or\nhowever you want to say it.\n\n157\n00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:52,244\nWe had this big debate one\nday over how to pronounce it.\n\n158\n00:07:52,244 --> 00:07:53,184\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we went online and\n\n159\n00:07:53,184 --> 00:07:55,710\nwe found different pages that\nwould pronounce it for us, and\n\n160\n00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,106\nthey all said it different ways.\n\n161\n00:07:57,106 --> 00:07:58,211\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I don't think it really\n\n162\n00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,331\nmatters how you say it.\n\n163\n00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:00,304\nSo Kira Biros.\n\n164\n00:08:00,304 --> 00:08:01,748\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So,\n\n165\n00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,764\nKerberos is how I normally say it.\n\n166\n00:08:03,764 --> 00:08:05,894\nBut anyhow, so\nthat's what it's built upon.\n\n167\n00:08:05,894 --> 00:08:08,975\nThat was actually an authentication\nmechanism that was\n\n168\n00:08:08,975 --> 00:08:13,706\ndesigned in the Unix world, and so it's\nbeen around a long time, it's very robust.\n\n169\n00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:16,295\nOf course,\nMicrosoft messed with it a bit, and so\n\n170\n00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:19,220\nit's not completely standards compliant.\n\n171\n00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,970\nBut they use it pretty heavily.\n\n172\n00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,110\nYou can, too.\n\n173\n00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:22,670\nAll right.\n\n174\n00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,360\nSome of the other ones that are out there,\nthings like LDAP.\n\n175\n00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,610\nLDAP is\nthe Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.\n\n176\n00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,900\nIt really isn't an authentication\nmechanism itself.\n\n177\n00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,030\nIt's really just a way of\ntalking to a database.\n\n178\n00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:38,870\nSo, for example, Microsoft's active\ndirectory, it's built using Kerberos for\n\n179\n00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,980\nauthentication.\n\n180\n00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,040\nIt uses LDAP for the request.\n\n181\n00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,950\nSo, when someone logs in,\n\n182\n00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,600\nthey're actually sending an LDAP\nquery to the database saying,\n\n183\n00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,390\nhey, here's my username and password or\nhash and password, am I allowed in?\n\n184\n00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,465\nAnd the database is responding back yes or\nno..\n\n185\n00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,780\nAll right.\n\n186\n00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,120\nBut if we wanna go\ncompletely vendor-neutral,\n\n187\n00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,160\nif we want an authentication system\nthat'll work on no matter what\n\n188\n00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,460\nsystem we're on, there's really\njust two guys that we go to.\n\n189\n00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,732\nAnd that's RADIUS, and TACACS, all right?\n\n190\n00:09:07,732 --> 00:09:11,540\nRADIUS, I always screw this one up Ray,\nwhat does it stand for?\n\n191\n00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,200\n>> Remote Authentication\nDial In User Service.\n\n192\n00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,820\n>> Yeah, and so it's the authentication,\nI always do remote access, but\n\n193\n00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,040\nit's an authentication protocol.\n\n194\n00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,940\nSo remote authentication,\nRADIUS was developed a long time ago,\n\n195\n00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,050\nI think it was in the 80s,\nso well over 20 years ago.\n\n196\n00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,670\nAnd it was designed originally for\ndial up systems.\n\n197\n00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,360\nIf you used an internet\nservice provider in the 80s or\n\n198\n00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,990\n90s, I think about my first one.\n\n199\n00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,890\nI got my first internet account in\n1991 to 1992 right around there, and\n\n200\n00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,560\nyou would dial up.\n\n201\n00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,820\nAnd you would get a log in prompt and\nyou have to pass off a user name and\n\n202\n00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,390\npassword in order to connect and\nyou'd get a shell screen and off you go.\n\n203\n00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,435\nYour text browsing glory.\n\n204\n00:09:51,435 --> 00:09:52,740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, there was no browsing,\n\n205\n00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,070\nthere was no web, but you'd fire up\nGopher or Archie and have a good time.\n\n206\n00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,990\nBut that authentication that happened was\nauthenticating against a RADIUS server.\n\n207\n00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:07,180\nThe cool part about RADIUS is it really\nwasn't designed to do authentication\n\n208\n00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,430\nitself, it was designed to be a middleman,\nan intermediary.\n\n209\n00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,220\nAnd, so you can have whatever\nuser account database you wanted.\n\n210\n00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,860\nYou could have any of them, Novell,\nWindows, Linux, Unix, whatever,\n\n211\n00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,520\nyou can have any kinda user\ndatabase that you wanted.\n\n212\n00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,770\nAnd then you can run RADIUS on top of it.\n\n213\n00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,720\nAnd then your applications, all your\nsoftware, didn't have to know how to talk\n\n214\n00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,500\nto your directory, they just needed to\nknow how to talk to the RADIUS server.\n\n215\n00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,400\nAnd they would talk to\nthe RADIUS server and\n\n216\n00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,300\nsay hey, is this a proper login\ncombination for somebody to get in?\n\n217\n00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,800\nAnd the RADIUS server would turn\naround and talk to that directory.\n\n218\n00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,720\nAnd get the answer for us.\n\n219\n00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,850\nBecause it was so generic and flexible and\nusable like that, RADIUS really caught on.\n\n220\n00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,640\nAnd even though dial-up access is dead,\nhere we are 30 years later, and\n\n221\n00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,800\nwe're still using RADIUS today,\nbecause it's very powerful, all right?\n\n222\n00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:02,640\nSo, it gives us that nice streamline way\nto be able to authenticate our users.\n\n223\n00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,850\nNow, RADIUS wasn't the only authentication\nprotocol that was out there,\n\n224\n00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,600\nthere was another one called TACACS,\nand you get this acronym?\n\n225\n00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,050\n>> Yep.\n>> All right, so TACACS is\n\n226\n00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:17,060\nTerminal Access Controller\nAccess Control System.\n\n227\n00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,830\nRolls right off the tongue.\n\n228\n00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,140\n>> It is a mouthful.\n\n229\n00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,160\nSo, with TACACS this one is very,\nvery similar to RADIUS.\n\n230\n00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,360\nThe big difference is in kind\nof how it's features work.\n\n231\n00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,260\nSo, it does work a slightly\ndifferent way than RADIUS.\n\n232\n00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,580\nThere's pros and cons with both, but\nthink of it as like VHS and Betamax.\n\n233\n00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,400\nOver the years we had this battle\nbetween RADIUS and TACACS.\n\n234\n00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,890\nAnd RADIUS was VHS, and\nTACACS was Betamax.\n\n235\n00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,060\nAnd so, TACACS didn't make it.\n\n236\n00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,198\nToday TACACS is really not used.\n\n237\n00:11:49,198 --> 00:11:51,860\nVery, very few people make use of TACACS,\nbut\n\n238\n00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,970\nthere is one company that stood\nby TACACS and still uses it.\n\n239\n00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,400\nAnd that company is Cisco.\n\n240\n00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,040\nNow Cisco, being the network leader,\nlike the industry leader in the networking\n\n241\n00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,460\nrealm, that makes it where\nTACACS is still pretty relevant.\n\n242\n00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,950\nBut the original TACACS is\npretty antiquated, and so\n\n243\n00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,890\nCisco has been updating it and\nmodifying it over the years.\n\n244\n00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,290\nAnd they've modified it so\n\n245\n00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:16,940\nmuch that it's no longer compatible\nwith the original TACACS.\n\n246\n00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,229\nAnd so the Cisco implementation of it\nis called TACACS+, and you'll notice on\n\n247\n00:12:21,229 --> 00:12:25,789\nthe objectives that's specifically the one\nthey call our right there is TACACS+.\n\n248\n00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:31,500\nSo, that's an important little note,\nthat plus symbol right there.\n\n249\n00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,750\nSo Cisco does still support it.\n\n250\n00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,810\nNobody else does.\n\n251\n00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,960\nI haven't seen TACACS support on\nanything other than Cisco stuff, but\n\n252\n00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,905\nit is still out there,\nso be aware of that.\n\n253\n00:12:40,905 --> 00:12:41,660\nMm-hm.\n\n254\n00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:47,480\n>> Yeah, and\none thing with TACACS+that makes it a plus\n\n255\n00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:54,120\nover the the TACACS is that TACACS+ also\nsupports multifactor authentication,\n\n256\n00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:00,290\nand another thing with TACACS is that\nit encrypts the whole login process.\n\n257\n00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,020\nSo comparing that to RADIUS, so\n\n258\n00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,192\nRADIUS will just encrypt the password,\nas it goes across.\n\n259\n00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:09,920\nSo username sent out in plain text,\nas where TACACS+,\n\n260\n00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,220\nit will send out the user name and\nthe password encrypted.\n\n261\n00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,165\n>> Yeah.\n\n262\n00:13:15,165 --> 00:13:17,725\nAnd there's all sorts of features\nthat are that are built into them,\n\n263\n00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:22,095\nthat they have kind of been adding to\nover the years to make them better.\n\n264\n00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:25,345\nWe'll find that RADIUS is the one that\nwe're going to use most commonly.\n\n265\n00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:26,825\nIt's got a lot of the good features.\n\n266\n00:13:26,825 --> 00:13:28,735\nAnd I want to show you\nguys an example that.\n\n267\n00:13:28,735 --> 00:13:31,875\nOn the exam, they want you to know\nthe differences between the two.\n\n268\n00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,935\nBut I want to show you guys\na real practice example.\n\n269\n00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:38,965\nSo I find it easier to understand RADIUS\nand TACACS when you compare the two, so\n\n270\n00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:41,010\nI made this little chart\nto help with that.\n\n271\n00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,380\nWhen you look at these two technologies,\n\n272\n00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,470\nthey both provide authentication,\nauthorization and accounting.\n\n273\n00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,980\nThey do all three of\nthose things that kind of\n\n274\n00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,625\nfall under this authentication umbrella.\n\n275\n00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,345\nBut they have different strengths and\nweaknesses.\n\n276\n00:13:56,345 --> 00:13:59,675\nSo if you take radius, well,\nit's an open standard,\n\n277\n00:13:59,675 --> 00:14:03,815\nanybody can run it, it does a great\njob at authenticating users.\n\n278\n00:14:03,815 --> 00:14:08,685\nIt does a wonderful job, really makes sure\nthat everything is handed off securely,\n\n279\n00:14:08,685 --> 00:14:11,205\nthat we interact with various\ndatabases on the back end,\n\n280\n00:14:11,205 --> 00:14:14,220\nvery powerful stuff,\nworks really well, all right?\n\n281\n00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,130\nIt also does a great job at accounting.\n\n282\n00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:21,270\nRADIUS keeps excellent logs of when\npeople access the network, what they did,\n\n283\n00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:25,040\nand supports storing them in recording\nformats where you can get the data out,\n\n284\n00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,410\nit does a really good job of that.\n\n285\n00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,760\nBut what RADIUS is weak,\nis authorization, right?\n\n286\n00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,340\nWhen somebody connects to your network,\nwhat are they authorized to do,\n\n287\n00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,570\nwhat are they allowed to do?\n\n288\n00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:39,540\nWell, in the RADIUS world, we really just\nhave whether they're allowed to connect or\n\n289\n00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,880\nnot, and that's it.\n\n290\n00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,740\nWe don't really have much more for\nauthorization beyond that,\n\n291\n00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,520\nand you can retrofit it\nwith a couple of things.\n\n292\n00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,620\nI'll show you an example in a minute.\n\n293\n00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,720\nBut it just has basic authorization.\n\n294\n00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,830\nIt doesn't do the greatest job there.\n\n295\n00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,410\nTACACS on the other hand, TACACS,\nit's not an open standard anymore,\n\n296\n00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,245\ncuz Cisco's bastardized it so much.\n\n297\n00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:00,690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it is it's still out there.\n\n298\n00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,200\nYou can run it.\n\n299\n00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,040\nIt does a great job of authentication,\njust like RADIUS does, but\n\n300\n00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,042\nit does a great job at authorization.\n\n301\n00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:15,150\nWith TACACS+, you can get super granular,\nand you can say, hey, when this person\n\n302\n00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:18,470\nconnects, they're allowed to run this\ncommand, this command, and this command.\n\n303\n00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,490\nThey're not allowed to\nrun these other commands.\n\n304\n00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,754\nOr they can run this\ncommand between 1 p.m.\n\n305\n00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:23,290\nand 2 p.m.\n\n306\n00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,120\nin the afternoon and that's it.\n\n307\n00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,830\nOr they can run this command five times,\nand they can't run it anymore than that.\n\n308\n00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:32,098\nSo you can get really super\nspecific in granular with TACACS.\n\n309\n00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,368\nIt's really impressive!\n\n310\n00:15:33,368 --> 00:15:37,566\nAll right, but\nTACACS accounting is not very good.\n\n311\n00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:40,840\nIt's just not a great account solution.\n\n312\n00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,840\nIt doesn't log data as\nwell as RADIUS does.\n\n313\n00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,280\nSo, in the general world,\nmost people looked at it and\n\n314\n00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:53,150\nsaid well, I'd rather have good\naccounting than authorization.\n\n315\n00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,679\nAnd that's why RADIUS became the winner.\n\n316\n00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:58,156\nThat was the one that people selected,\nbecause it met most people's needs.\n\n317\n00:15:58,156 --> 00:16:03,079\nBut Cisco They said, man, we'd really\nlike to have the best of all three,\n\n318\n00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:08,174\nwe'd love to have it where we had great,\ngreat, great in all three columns.\n\n319\n00:16:08,174 --> 00:16:12,799\nAnd so what Cisco did is they created\ntheir own technology called Cisco ACS,\n\n320\n00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,463\nwhich is their, access control server.\n\n321\n00:16:15,463 --> 00:16:21,012\nAnd Cisco ACS runs both,\nit runs RADIUS and TACACS.\n\n322\n00:16:21,012 --> 00:16:26,226\nAnd because it's running both, it can\ndo RADIUS or TACACS for authentication.\n\n323\n00:16:26,226 --> 00:16:30,949\nIt uses TACACS for authentication and\nRADIUS for accounting and\n\n324\n00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:35,010\nby doing that,\nthey get the best of both worlds.\n\n325\n00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:40,070\nThat's why Cisco has kept TACACS around\nwhen everybody else has let it go.\n\n326\n00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,930\nThey've hung onto it for that purpose.\n\n327\n00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,869\nRight, so I wanted to make\nsure you guys kinda saw that.\n\n328\n00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:48,780\nAnd understood why we still had these\ncompeting technologies even though one was\n\n329\n00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,790\neffectively dead, right?\n\n330\n00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,030\nThis is the main reason.\n\n331\n00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,800\nNow on the exam,\n\n332\n00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,850\nyou're not gonna see ACS because\nthat's just Cisco proprietary, right?\n\n333\n00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,840\nThey're trying to stay vendor neutral,\nbut you will see RADIUS and TACACS.\n\n334\n00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,280\nThose guys will turn up.\n\n335\n00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:00,900\nAll right?\n\n336\n00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,470\nSo I want to show you guys\nan example of RADIUS in action.\n\n337\n00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,353\nAll right?\n\n338\n00:17:05,353 --> 00:17:09,695\nAnd I'll use it here with\nthe Active Directory to show you.\n\n339\n00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:14,175\nA great example I have, I work on Cisco\nequipment a lot, I'm a network guy,\n\n340\n00:17:14,175 --> 00:17:17,535\nthat's one of the areas that\nI really like to work in.\n\n341\n00:17:17,535 --> 00:17:21,335\nAnd on a Cisco router when\nyou connect to it and\n\n342\n00:17:21,335 --> 00:17:24,355\nyou authenticate,\nnormally you're connecting and\n\n343\n00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:29,515\nauthenticating using user accounts that\nare stored right there on the router.\n\n344\n00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,950\nSo if I take a look at this router.\n\n345\n00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,700\nAnd I take a look at\nthe user accounts around,\n\n346\n00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,350\nI can see I've got a user\naccount called admin.\n\n347\n00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,150\nAnd here's the password, right,\nit's a hashed password, but it's there.\n\n348\n00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:47,385\nAnd if the user wanted to connect to\nthis router, they could telnet into it.\n\n349\n00:17:47,385 --> 00:17:50,060\nOr, you know, obviously we'd\nrather use SSH, but just for\n\n350\n00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,645\nthe example here I've got telnet.\n\n351\n00:17:51,645 --> 00:17:52,245\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n352\n00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:56,347\nthey can login with that admin account and\nthe password if I can remember it.\n\n353\n00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:57,670\nThere we go.\n\n354\n00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:02,330\nAnd they can gain access to the router and\nstart to work with it, okay.\n\n355\n00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,740\nSo great, well here's the problem.\n\n356\n00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:11,220\nIf I have ten network admins, I need to go\nand create ten accounts on this router.\n\n357\n00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,140\nWhat if I have 100 routers?\n\n358\n00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,930\nWell then I need to create\nten accounts on 100 routers.\n\n359\n00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,128\nAnd what happens if I want\nto change my password?\n\n360\n00:18:21,128 --> 00:18:24,250\nI've got to go and change my\npassword on all of those routers.\n\n361\n00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,530\nThat's not something that's very\nscalable and not very manageable.\n\n362\n00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,000\nAnd so what do companies do?\n\n363\n00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,410\nThey do what you see right here.\n\n364\n00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,960\nThey set a single user name and\n\n365\n00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,800\npassword on the router and then they\nshare it amongst the network admins.\n\n366\n00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,760\nThey just tell all the network admins hey,\nhere's the username and\n\n367\n00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,120\npassword, this works on\nall of our routers, right.\n\n368\n00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,280\nWell, what if you get\na disgruntled network admin and\n\n369\n00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,590\nthey get fired and\nthey leave the company, whatever.\n\n370\n00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,230\nNow you've got to change that password.\n\n371\n00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,520\nEverybody has got to learn\nthe new password and\n\n372\n00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,940\nit's got to be shared\namongst the network admins.\n\n373\n00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,740\nIt's not a good solution, all right.\n\n374\n00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,160\nBut Cisco routers, they authenticate\nagainst their own database.\n\n375\n00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,690\nIt's what they do.\n\n376\n00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,970\nSo what can we do to help with that?\n\n377\n00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,400\nAnd the answer is RADIUS.\n\n378\n00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,910\nWe could use a centralized RADIUS server.\n\n379\n00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,130\nAnd have all the routers and\nswitchers authenticate against that.\n\n380\n00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,000\nAuthenticate against the RADIUS server and\n\n381\n00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,990\nyou'd probably do more than one RADIUS\nserver for redundancy purposes.\n\n382\n00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,490\nRight?\nBecause if one fails you don't want to be\n\n383\n00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,880\nlocked out of everything, but you can\nget that for centralized management.\n\n384\n00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,080\nThe nice thing there is when you hire\na new employee, you just create an account\n\n385\n00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,620\nonce and RADIUS sees it and\nnow all of your other equipment sees it.\n\n386\n00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,580\nThat's the real big benefit, all right.\n\n387\n00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,760\nSo, where do we put our user accounts?\n\n388\n00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,290\nThat's up to you.\n\n389\n00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:35,272\nYou might want to run OpenLdap,\nOpen Directory.\n\n390\n00:19:35,272 --> 00:19:37,990\nActive Directory,\nwhatever it is that you want to use.\n\n391\n00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,570\nI don't want to use any\nof the directories.\n\n392\n00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,680\nI've got this Windows server, here.\n\n393\n00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,035\nI'm just gonna use it's local accounts,\nright here on this Windows box.\n\n394\n00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:48,630\nThough, this Windows machine, I've\ninstalled the Microsoft RADIUS Service on\n\n395\n00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,750\nit, and I've got a shortcut right here.\n\n396\n00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,550\nSo here's the Radius Service that's\nrunning on this Windows machine.\n\n397\n00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:59,920\nAnd by default it's going to\nauthenticate against the local\n\n398\n00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,390\ndatabase on this machine.\n\n399\n00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,580\nIf it was an Active Directory\nDomain Controller then it would be\n\n400\n00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,180\nActive Directory, but\nin this case it's the Windows,\n\n401\n00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,300\njust the local user account database.\n\n402\n00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,540\nSo, I'm gonna pull that up and\nI can see my Local Users and Groups.\n\n403\n00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,160\nAnd so here's some various user accounts\nthat are here on this system, all right?\n\n404\n00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,530\nI'm gonna create a user account for\nmyself.\n\n405\n00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:25,590\nSo I'll just create a user account called\ndpazat and I'll set me a password.\n\n406\n00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,712\nAll right.\n\n407\n00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:34,204\nAnd so there we go, now I've got a user\naccount, here on this system, right there.\n\n408\n00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:39,400\nOkay, so if I want to log\ninto this computer, I can.\n\n409\n00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,770\nI've got a user account.\n\n410\n00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:44,930\nBut the router doesn't know that, it\ndoesn't know to look over to that server.\n\n411\n00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,300\nSo what we can do is we can\nset up RADIUS to handle that.\n\n412\n00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,200\nRADIUS acting as the intermediary\nbetween the router and my database.\n\n413\n00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,360\nA Cisco router doesn't know how to talk to\na Windows server, it just doesn't, but it\n\n414\n00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,880\nknows how to talk to a RADIUS server, so\nwe're gonna get RADIUS as our middle man.\n\n415\n00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,592\nNow, because I'm on a Windows server and\n\n416\n00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:06,479\nI'm running the Windows RADIUS\nimplementation, right.\n\n417\n00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:08,775\nLike if you're running Linux,\nit's got RADIUS built into it, so\n\n418\n00:21:08,775 --> 00:21:10,543\nyou don't even have to\ninstall it in most distros.\n\n419\n00:21:10,543 --> 00:21:12,386\nSo, you know, you can just fire it up and\n\n420\n00:21:12,386 --> 00:21:15,500\nit will authenticate against this\nlocal database just by default.\n\n421\n00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,608\nBut you can configure it to point to\nany database, Novell, eDirectory,\n\n422\n00:21:18,608 --> 00:21:20,980\nwhatever it is that you have,\nall sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n423\n00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,444\nSo, I'm just going to go in here to\nmy RADIUS clients and, actually,\n\n424\n00:21:24,444 --> 00:21:26,620\nit looks like I already defined it.\n\n425\n00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,910\nSo, I set my router up as a client.\n\n426\n00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,520\nThe router needs to be able to\ntalk to this RADIUS server.\n\n427\n00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,300\nAnd the key point here is that\nyou need to set a shared secret,\n\n428\n00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,495\na password that the router will use\nto connect to the RADIUS server.\n\n429\n00:21:40,495 --> 00:21:42,880\nCuz you don't want somebody trying\nto brute force your RADIUS server.\n\n430\n00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:47,120\nAll right, so\nI'm just gonna define that there.\n\n431\n00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,320\nAnd then you define a policy.\n\n432\n00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,120\nA policy that says when\nsomebody dials in and\n\n433\n00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,370\nconnects, how do I know whether\nthey're allowed to connect and\n\n434\n00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,640\nif they are allowed to connect\nwhat are they allowed to do?\n\n435\n00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,240\nAll right?\n\n436\n00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,480\nSo I've created a policy here called\nCisco device authentication and\n\n437\n00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,560\nif I double click on it here.\n\n438\n00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,730\nYou'll see what it's checking for.\n\n439\n00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:08,486\nIt's saying all right\nwhen somebody connects,\n\n440\n00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:13,525\nif they're in the Network Admins group,\nthen let them connect,\n\n441\n00:22:13,525 --> 00:22:16,840\notherwise don't let them connect right?\n\n442\n00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,400\nSo that this is specifically\nallowing just plain Network Admins.\n\n443\n00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,110\nNow I created a user account for myself,\nbut I didn't put myself in Network Admin,\n\n444\n00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,850\nso let me do that real quick.\n\n445\n00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,170\nI'm gonna into Member Of and\nadd myself to Network Admins.\n\n446\n00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,060\nThere we go, all right.\n\n447\n00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,120\nNow, that's the authentication piece.\n\n448\n00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,430\nWhen somebody authenticates, when they\nsend off their username and password,\n\n449\n00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,150\nit finds out what groups they're in,\nit sees if they're in Network Admins and\n\n450\n00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,420\nif they are, it allows them to connect,\nright, they're authenticated.\n\n451\n00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,420\nThen there's the authorization piece,\n\n452\n00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,900\nwell part of that authorization\nis they're authorized to connect,\n\n453\n00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,270\ngrant remote access permission, right,\nwe're gonna authorize them to do that.\n\n454\n00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,970\nBut what about beyond that?\n\n455\n00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,580\nWell, I'm gonna go into\nmy profile here and\n\n456\n00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:04,370\nRADIUS does a pretty poor\njob of authorization.\n\n457\n00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,210\nSo what we have to do is pass\noff these variables here.\n\n458\n00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,830\nAnd so I'm passing off this variable\nto the router saying when they connect,\n\n459\n00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,790\nthey're authorized to get\na shell with privilege level 15.\n\n460\n00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:18,450\nIn the Cisco world, that means they get\nfull administrative access to the router.\n\n461\n00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,640\nSo if you're in the Network Admins group,\n\n462\n00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,530\nyou'll get full administrative\naccess to that router.\n\n463\n00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,790\nAll right, so\nthe RADIUS server is all set up.\n\n464\n00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,040\nI need to tell the router to do it, okay.\n\n465\n00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,980\nThe router doesn't know to\nuse RADIUS automatically,\n\n466\n00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,880\nright, it's just gonna\nuse it's local database.\n\n467\n00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,319\nIf I, you know if I try and\ntelnet in again with a different account.\n\n468\n00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,673\nLet me just come in here again, and\n\n469\n00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:46,960\nI'm gonna try and login as dpazat, right.\n\n470\n00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,012\nWell, I'm gonna punch in my username and\npassword, and it's gonna run it.\n\n471\n00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:54,643\nAnd it doesn't know that account,\nauthentication failed right?\n\n472\n00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:58,051\nAnd that's because it's just\nlooking at it's local database.\n\n473\n00:23:58,051 --> 00:24:02,683\nIf I do a show run and I pull up just\nthe user names I'll see that that\n\n474\n00:24:02,683 --> 00:24:05,729\nusername dpezet doesn't exist on there.\n\n475\n00:24:05,729 --> 00:24:07,383\nSo, it just doesn't have that account.\n\n476\n00:24:07,383 --> 00:24:10,490\nSo I need to tell it\nabout that RADIUS server.\n\n477\n00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:18,631\nSo I'm gonna come in here and\nsay RADIUS server host 192.160.0.100 key.\n\n478\n00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,180\nThat's the password I use, cisco123.\n\n479\n00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:26,100\nSo now I've told it about the RADIUS\nserver, so it knows about it.\n\n480\n00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,912\nBut now I need to tell it to use it.\n\n481\n00:24:27,912 --> 00:24:31,854\nSo I'm gonna say for authentication.\n\n482\n00:24:37,484 --> 00:24:44,420\nI'm gonna tell it here that when somebody\ntries to log into this server, use RADIUS.\n\n483\n00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,700\nBut just in case the RADIUS\nserver goes down,\n\n484\n00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,408\nI'm gonna do a little back up here and\njust add local.\n\n485\n00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,533\nIf it can't contact the RADIUS server,\n\n486\n00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,916\nthen it'll let me log in with\nthe local accounts on this router.\n\n487\n00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:57,335\nAnd I'm gonna do the same thing for\nauthorization.\n\n488\n00:24:57,335 --> 00:25:00,380\nAuthorization's a little different though\nbecause they've already logged in at that\n\n489\n00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,180\npoint, so I need to say when they\nget a shell, so an exec shell.\n\n490\n00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:09,394\nSo I'll say authorization exec,\ndefault group RADIUS, local.\n\n491\n00:25:09,394 --> 00:25:12,770\nAll right, so now it knows,\n\n492\n00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:18,040\nwhen somebody goes to log in, reach out to\nthat RADIUS server to authenticate them.\n\n493\n00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,850\nAnd now I can try that connection again.\n\n494\n00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,730\nI'm gonna connect to that router.\n\n495\n00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,760\nAnd now I'm gonna try and\nlog in as dpezet.\n\n496\n00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,080\nAnd I'll punch in my password.\n\n497\n00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,910\nAnd now it's reaching out in\nthe background to talk to\n\n498\n00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,920\nthat RADIUS server and saying,\nhey, is this a valid account?\n\n499\n00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,505\nAnd it finds out, yeah, it's valid.\n\n500\n00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:43,065\nLet him in.\nAnd then it says,\n\n501\n00:25:43,065 --> 00:25:44,865\nokay, what are they allowed to get?\n\n502\n00:25:44,865 --> 00:25:48,775\nAnd RADIUS says, they're authorized\nto get shell privilege level 15, and\n\n503\n00:25:48,775 --> 00:25:51,535\nI can see I was granted\nadministrative shell right there.\n\n504\n00:25:51,535 --> 00:25:53,584\nI have that,\nthat little pound symbol in Cisco world?\n\n505\n00:25:53,584 --> 00:25:56,805\nThat lets you know that you have\nadministrative access to the router.\n\n506\n00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,985\nSo, it just authenticated me and\nauthorized me, and\n\n507\n00:26:00,985 --> 00:26:03,290\nI'm now in the system and ready to work.\n\n508\n00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,574\nThe nice thing about this.\n\n509\n00:26:04,574 --> 00:26:09,030\nNow, your admins, your network admins,\nthey don't have to have\n\n510\n00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:12,710\nseparate credentials for their own\ncomputer and for the routers and so on.\n\n511\n00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,900\nThey just have one account.\n\n512\n00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,550\nTheir account, it's like a single sign on.\n\n513\n00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,990\nThey can use it to log into Windows.\n\n514\n00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,960\nThey can use it to log into their routers.\n\n515\n00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,330\nYou can set up your Linux boxes and\nyour switches.\n\n516\n00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,370\nYou can set them to\nauthenticate against RADIUS.\n\n517\n00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:27,210\nAnd now they have one account that works\nacross all of these disparate systems.\n\n518\n00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,030\nThat's the best part about RADIUS.\n\n519\n00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:34,180\nThe other thing is, if an employee leaves,\n\n520\n00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,720\nI just go into my user account\ndatabase and I disable their account.\n\n521\n00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,980\nAnd if they try and log in to a switch or\na router or whatever, they're disabled.\n\n522\n00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,240\nLet me show you that.\n\n523\n00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,927\nSo if I go back here to my user database,\nand I take that dpezet account.\n\n524\n00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:51,580\nAnd I'm going to disable it there.\n\n525\n00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,187\nSo now that dpezet account is disabled,\nand I'm gonna try and connect in again\n\n526\n00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:04,373\nAll right, so I'll try and\nlog in as dpezet.\n\n527\n00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:07,885\nAll right, it's reaching out to\nthe RADIUS server on the back end.\n\n528\n00:27:07,885 --> 00:27:09,193\nAuthentication failed.\n\n529\n00:27:09,193 --> 00:27:11,565\nAnd I don't have to tell\nall my network admins, hey,\n\n530\n00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:13,225\nyou guys all need to\nchange your passwords.\n\n531\n00:27:13,225 --> 00:27:16,670\nCuz they all have their own individual\naccounts, and if they want to change their\n\n532\n00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,540\npassword, they can,\nthey can change it whenever they want.\n\n533\n00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,990\nThey just go into Windows and change it,\nand now on the routers, on the switches,\n\n534\n00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,460\neverywhere else, they're able to\nlog in with that same account.\n\n535\n00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,010\nThat's the power of RADIUS.\n\n536\n00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:29,090\nThat's where it's really,\nreally valuable and really useful.\n\n537\n00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:33,720\nWhen you're managing hundreds or thousands\nof routers and switches, you can't\n\n538\n00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,460\nmanage individual user databases across\nthose things, it's too much of a hassle.\n\n539\n00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,560\nSo having a centralized database,\nthat's the way to go.\n\n540\n00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,350\nI showed you here using the active\ndirectory because that's the most common,\n\n541\n00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,350\nthat's the one you run\ninto the most often.\n\n542\n00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:50,170\nBut this works just the same\nwith open directory on Mac OS,\n\n543\n00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,980\nwith open LDAP on Linux,\nwith NIS+ on Solaris.\n\n544\n00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,580\nI mean, it really works\nthe same across the board, and\n\n545\n00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,500\nit lets you use that user\naccount database of your choice.\n\n546\n00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:07,455\nSo, going back to our objectives,\nwhich apparently I have closed.\n\n547\n00:28:07,455 --> 00:28:09,745\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Going back to our objectives,\n\n548\n00:28:09,745 --> 00:28:15,780\n[LAUGH] which you know is it too\ncrazy to ask for a, there we go.\n\n549\n00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,940\nAll right, so, going back to our\nobjectives, you know that tackles\n\n550\n00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,430\nhow we can handle authentication services,\nand you guys see it's not very hard.\n\n551\n00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:26,190\nThe only one we didn't\ntalk about was SAML, and\n\n552\n00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:30,040\nSAML, that's the, should I even try?\n\n553\n00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,260\nIt's-\n>> The Security Assertion Market Language.\n\n554\n00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,365\n>> So, SAML is a newer\nstandard that's been developed\n\n555\n00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:41,345\nto allow you to do mostly single sign on.\n\n556\n00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:44,265\nIf you look at anywhere where\nthey've got environments where you\n\n557\n00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:48,707\nhave like a mainframe and an active\ndirectory and an open directory and\n\n558\n00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:52,595\nall these different databases,\nhow can you have a user account in\n\n559\n00:28:52,595 --> 00:28:56,125\none of those directories authenticate\nagainst a separate directory?\n\n560\n00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,555\nA different environment, right?\n\n561\n00:28:57,555 --> 00:29:01,365\nHow do you have shared user accounts\nacross separate organizations.\n\n562\n00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,560\nWell, SAML allows for that.\n\n563\n00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,308\nThere's a lot of things that use this,\nyou've got OAuth.\n\n564\n00:29:06,308 --> 00:29:11,610\nWe see OAuth a lot, where you can log\nin to Google with your OAuth account or\n\n565\n00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:17,164\nyou can log into some other website using\nyour Google credentials through OAuth.\n\n566\n00:29:17,164 --> 00:29:20,790\nWell, SAML is one of the technologies\nunder the hood that's providing that,\n\n567\n00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,760\nallowing the single sign-on.\n\n568\n00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,022\nSimilar to what RADIUS does, where\nRADIUS allows these disparate systems to\n\n569\n00:29:27,022 --> 00:29:31,400\nauthenticate against each other, SAML\nworks the same way, except SAML is not\n\n570\n00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,460\nactually a protocol, like RADIUS,\nSAML is just a markup language, like HTML.\n\n571\n00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:41,580\nIt's a standard way for you to format your\nuser account tokens and authentication\n\n572\n00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:45,220\nrequests to be able to send them that\nwill be understood by multiple systems.\n\n573\n00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,620\nSo that's another one that we\nsee creeping up a good bit.\n\n574\n00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:50,290\nAll right.\n\n575\n00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,610\nWell, Nate, I think that covers\nthe authentication services.\n\n576\n00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,620\nWe got a lot more to go through,\nthough, so, but\n\n577\n00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,625\nthis is probably a good spot to stop and\ntake a break, right?\n\n578\n00:29:57,625 --> 00:29:58,340\n>> Mm-hmm.\nYeah.\n\n579\n00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:58,970\nSounds good.\n\n580\n00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,300\n>> All right.\nLet's pause here and take a break.\n\n581\n00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,220\nWhen we get back, we're gonna take\na look at some access controls, and\n\n582\n00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,330\nthose are things that we\nwork with every single day.\n\n583\n00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,280\nSo definitely something\nwe wanna learn about.\n\n584\n00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,500\nSo stay tuned.\n\n585\n00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,521\nWe'll be back after this.\n\n586\n00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:17,009\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n587\n00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:18,560\n>> All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n588\n00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,300\nSo, in the last segment we\ntook a look at authentication.\n\n589\n00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,910\nNow we're gonna take a look at a few\nother things that we need to be aware of,\n\n590\n00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,150\nespecially when it comes to authorization.\n\n591\n00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:31,740\nNow in the authorization world\nThis is where we figure out what\n\n592\n00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,900\npeople are allowed to\ndo once they connect.\n\n593\n00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:39,160\nAnd there's a number of different terms\nin here that are all pretty impo- whoa.\n\n594\n00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,793\n>> Whoa.\n>> That's a little bit bigger than I\n\n595\n00:30:40,793 --> 00:30:43,712\nintended to go there, but\nwe'll definitely be able to read it now.\n\n596\n00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:46,370\n[LAUGH] So\nthese are the things that you know,\n\n597\n00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:50,360\nhow we determine what people are able\nto do once they get connected.\n\n598\n00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,240\nAnd there's several different\nconcepts we need to be aware of for\n\n599\n00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,900\nthe exam, all right?\n\n600\n00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,370\nThe first one is what's called\nthe principle of least privilege.\n\n601\n00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,870\nThey just say least privilege here, but\n\n602\n00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:02,990\nit'll likely be the principle\nof least privilege on the exam.\n\n603\n00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:07,720\nAnd this is stating that, when you give\nsomebody access to your network, you could\n\n604\n00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,776\ngive them full total access to everything,\nso they can get in and work, right?\n\n605\n00:31:11,776 --> 00:31:13,250\nAnd that would work.\n\n606\n00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:16,960\nBut you'd more than likely be giving\nthem access to things they don't need\n\n607\n00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,520\naccess to.\n\n608\n00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,470\nAnd when that happens,\nit's a recipe for disaster.\n\n609\n00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,410\nAnd I gave a story in one of\nthe earlier episodes about some\n\n610\n00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,510\nweb developers that did that.\n\n611\n00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:29,000\nAnd some of the problems that it\ncaused me at a place where I worked.\n\n612\n00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,020\nWell, that's a very common thing.\n\n613\n00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,770\nSo, what you need to do when you're\ngiving somebody access to your network,\n\n614\n00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:37,380\nyou need to look at what their job is,\nwhat they do.\n\n615\n00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,460\nWhat they actually need access to, and\n\n616\n00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:45,670\nwhen you give them access,\nyou grant them the bare minimum.\n\n617\n00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:48,410\nJust to the access they\nneed to do their job, and\n\n618\n00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:51,360\nthat's going to prevent\nthem from maliciously or\n\n619\n00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,070\naccidentally getting into areas where\nthey shouldn't and causing problems.\n\n620\n00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,481\nThat's called the principle\nof least privilege.\n\n621\n00:31:57,481 --> 00:32:03,007\nWhen you give access, give people the\nleast amount of permissions possible for\n\n622\n00:32:03,007 --> 00:32:06,067\nthem to still be able\nto complete their job.\n\n623\n00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:08,731\nAnother similar concept\nis separation of duties.\n\n624\n00:32:08,731 --> 00:32:12,276\nIf you have just one\nperson responsible for\n\n625\n00:32:12,276 --> 00:32:16,716\na particular system,\nwhat oversight did they have?\n\n626\n00:32:16,716 --> 00:32:19,950\nThey could be doing all sorts of stuff,\nand you wouldn't know about it, right.\n\n627\n00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,610\nThere was a great story, it was awhile\nago, eight years ago I think, where there\n\n628\n00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:29,710\nwas a city in California where they put\na fiber-optic network in their city.\n\n629\n00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:33,100\nAnd one gentleman was responsible for\nthe entire network.\n\n630\n00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,950\nHe was the one that handled the\nconfiguration of all the fiber switches\n\n631\n00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:38,820\nand all that throughout\nthis entire framework.\n\n632\n00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,250\nWell, he became a disgruntled employee.\n\n633\n00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,378\nHe was unhappy with how the city was\nusing the fiber optic network and.\n\n634\n00:32:45,378 --> 00:32:49,400\nAnd so, he basically set it up where\nhe was the only one who had access, and\n\n635\n00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,850\none day they fired him.\n\n636\n00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,560\nThey terminated the guy, all right.\n\n637\n00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:57,050\nAnd when he was fired,\nhe refused to turn over the password.\n\n638\n00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:00,160\nHe wouldn't give them the password\nto their own fiber optic network.\n\n639\n00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,987\nSo the city was effectively\nlocked out of their own network.\n\n640\n00:33:02,987 --> 00:33:04,040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The guy,\n\n641\n00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,060\nthey ended up having to arrest him,\nthrow him in jail.\n\n642\n00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,830\nHe sat in jail for\n\n643\n00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:11,120\na while under contempt of court before\nhe finally did give up the password.\n\n644\n00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,120\nBut it was a great example of giving\none person too much power, all right.\n\n645\n00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,460\nWhen one person has sole\nresponsibility of something,\n\n646\n00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:23,630\nit can lead to bad scenarios like that,\nnot always, right, but sometimes.\n\n647\n00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:27,700\nNow, the way we solve that is\nwith separation of duties, right.\n\n648\n00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:31,680\nWe don't give one person\ntotal control of the system.\n\n649\n00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,110\nThey could have taken that\nfiber optic network and\n\n650\n00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,850\nsaid okay,\nthere's going to be two network admins.\n\n651\n00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,230\nOne who's responsible for the west\nside and one who's responsible for\n\n652\n00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,160\nthe east side, and they're going to\nwork together to cover that network.\n\n653\n00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,640\nAnd they're gonna be cross-trained in each\nother's areas so that they can help out,\n\n654\n00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,060\nand now it's no longer one person in\ncontrol of everything, all right.\n\n655\n00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:55,600\nThere's also more serious places where\nwe use things like separation of duties.\n\n656\n00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,870\nThink about double access\ncontrol on a submarine.\n\n657\n00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,420\nSo, a submarine might have a nuclear\nmissile, and no one person can launch it.\n\n658\n00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,721\nNo one person can just turn the key and\nlaunch that missile.\n\n659\n00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:07,410\nIt takes two people to turn the keys,\nright?\n\n660\n00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,630\nNo one person has that full duty.\n\n661\n00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:14,380\nWe can also see it as just dividing up\na duty, but not actually cross training.\n\n662\n00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:17,080\nSo we see this with backups a lot,\nwhere you might have\n\n663\n00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:21,640\none group of employees who are allowed\nto back up data on your network and and\n\n664\n00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,490\na separate group of employees that\nare allowed to restore it, right.\n\n665\n00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,710\nBack ups, they're boring.\n\n666\n00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:31,820\nThey're monotonous, but\nthey've got to be done every single day.\n\n667\n00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:37,780\nSo, many IT organizations bring in interns\nor entry level employees to do backups.\n\n668\n00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,160\nBut if you think about a backup,\nwhat are you backing up?\n\n669\n00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,860\nYour critical data.\n\n670\n00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,202\nSo if one of those interns backs\nup your data to a tape, and\n\n671\n00:34:46,202 --> 00:34:49,138\nthen they've got permission\nto restore it also.\n\n672\n00:34:49,138 --> 00:34:52,443\nThey could take it home,\nrestore your data, and now this untrained,\n\n673\n00:34:52,443 --> 00:34:55,480\nunprofessional employee could\nhave access to all of your data.\n\n674\n00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,820\nThat would be really bad.\n\n675\n00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,900\nSo we might separate the duties and\nhave it where yes,\n\n676\n00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,440\nthe interns can run the backups.\n\n677\n00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,920\nThey can make sure they complete\nsuccessfully, they can rotate the tapes.\n\n678\n00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,010\nBut only the admins can\nactually do a restore,\n\n679\n00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:11,110\nseparating the duties to insulate\nus from that possible risk.\n\n680\n00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,590\nAll right, those are all different\ntypes of separation of duties.\n\n681\n00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,430\nAccess control lists.\n\n682\n00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:21,740\nNow, ACLs are somethings we use every day,\nright?\n\n683\n00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,681\nAn access control list, well,\nit's what its name says.\n\n684\n00:35:24,681 --> 00:35:27,220\nIt's a list of people who\nhave access to something.\n\n685\n00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:31,770\nSo, when you have a file or a folder or\na printer that you're making\n\n686\n00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:36,420\navailable on the network, you might need\nto restrict who's able to get to it.\n\n687\n00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,780\nSo you create these filters, and you're\nfiltering based on all sorts of things.\n\n688\n00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,920\nMost commonly, you're filtering based\non usernames and passwords, right?\n\n689\n00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,325\nThese usernames, these user accounts\nare allowed to access this resource.\n\n690\n00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:50,295\nThese other user accounts aren't.\n\n691\n00:35:50,295 --> 00:35:56,005\nOr these user accounts, maybe Nate, Nate\ngets read and write access to this file,\n\n692\n00:35:56,005 --> 00:35:59,330\nbut our director Jason,\nhe just gets read access to the file.\n\n693\n00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,860\nWe create a list of those permissions, and\n\n694\n00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,540\nthat's what's called an access\ncontrol list, right.\n\n695\n00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,605\nThink of it of like the VIP\nroom at a nightclub.\n\n696\n00:36:07,605 --> 00:36:09,950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And they've got that list, right.\n\n697\n00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,160\nAnd you're not on the list.\n\n698\n00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,840\nSo you walk up to the door,\nyou're like hey, I want to go in.\n\n699\n00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,320\nAnd they say, well,\nyou're not on the list.\n\n700\n00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,190\nYou can't get in.\n\n701\n00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,870\nThat's an access control list, right.\n\n702\n00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,700\nAnd there it's enforced with a bouncer.\n\n703\n00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,300\nHere it's enforced with Windows or\nLinux or whatever.\n\n704\n00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,050\nSo it's not as cool, but\nyou guys get the idea.\n\n705\n00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,140\nNow there are many different types\nof access control lists, and\n\n706\n00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,530\nthat's actually what the next five\nentries are, mandatory access,\n\n707\n00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:35,410\ndiscretionary, rule-based,\nrole-based, time based.\n\n708\n00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:40,170\nAll of these things are different types\nof access control ACLs, all right.\n\n709\n00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,899\nSo, I'm kind of surprised they\ndidn't indent them here, but\n\n710\n00:36:42,899 --> 00:36:45,220\nthey are just different types, all right.\n\n711\n00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,880\nSo let's start with that first one,\nmandatory.\n\n712\n00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,955\nA mandatory access control list is one\nthat's defined by a system administrator,\n\n713\n00:36:52,955 --> 00:36:53,510\nright?\n\n714\n00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:58,270\nBut technically, the official\ndefinition is that a mandatory\n\n715\n00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:02,760\naccess list is one that's enforced by\nthe system, right, by the computer.\n\n716\n00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,550\nBut the computer doesn't know what to do.\n\n717\n00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,640\nThe computer's under\nthe control of a system admin.\n\n718\n00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,780\nSo, it's the system admin\nthat sets these rules,\n\n719\n00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,390\nit's the computer that enforces them,\nall right?\n\n720\n00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:16,470\nBut the key component here is\nthat the user is not involved.\n\n721\n00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:21,790\nThe end user is not able to modify or\noverride a mandatory access list.\n\n722\n00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:25,370\nSo a mandatory access list is\none that is set on the system,\n\n723\n00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:28,429\nenforced by the system, but it's\nactually set by a system administrator.\n\n724\n00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,350\nA discretionary access control list,\n\n725\n00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,050\nthat's one that is set by the user,\nall right.\n\n726\n00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:38,600\nSo the user can go in and set, and\nthey can change it to however they want.\n\n727\n00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,720\nSo the admins had one vision of security.\n\n728\n00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,110\nThe end user, it's at their discretion.\n\n729\n00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:47,397\nThey can pick, they can choose\nwhat they want to have, right?\n\n730\n00:37:47,397 --> 00:37:50,710\nLet me show you an example of that because\nit gets a little confusing, all right?\n\n731\n00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,900\nI'll just use my laptop right here.\n\n732\n00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,756\nSo I'm running Windows 8 or\n8.1 with update,\n\n733\n00:37:54,756 --> 00:37:58,020\nwhatever stupid name\nMicrosoft has given it.\n\n734\n00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:02,200\nSo I'm running Window's 8,\nand I have a user folder.\n\n735\n00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:07,460\nSo if I go to my Desktop and Don Pezet,\nhere's my user folder, okay?\n\n736\n00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,630\nAll of these folders have permissions\nthat came from somewhere.\n\n737\n00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,920\nWhere did they come from?\n\n738\n00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,670\nWell, they came from Microsoft.\n\n739\n00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,860\nWhen Microsoft built\nthe installation image for\n\n740\n00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,060\nWindows 8,\nthey set some default permissions.\n\n741\n00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,550\nThose become the mandatory\naccess control lists for\n\n742\n00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,340\nWindows for the file system, all right.\n\n743\n00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:28,650\nNow, as an administrator I could go in and\nchange those, but\n\n744\n00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,400\nas a regular user, I can't.\n\n745\n00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,363\nAnd so when I take a folder like my Music\nfolder, if I pull up my Properties and\n\n746\n00:38:36,363 --> 00:38:38,469\nI go to my Security tab, right.\n\n747\n00:38:38,469 --> 00:38:40,910\nWhen I go in here,\nI see there's some permissions.\n\n748\n00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:44,490\nIt says that the system has full control,\nand\n\n749\n00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,850\nadministrators have full control,\nand me, Don Pezet.\n\n750\n00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:53,717\nI've got full control, all right, but\nif I go to edit, this look what happens.\n\n751\n00:38:53,717 --> 00:38:56,747\nWhen I go to System >\nDon Pezet > Administrators,\n\n752\n00:38:56,747 --> 00:38:59,790\nall these checkmarks are grayed out,\nright?\n\n753\n00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:00,899\nI can't change these.\n\n754\n00:39:00,899 --> 00:39:04,170\nI can click on them all I want, and\nthey're not gonna change, okay?\n\n755\n00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,410\nThat's because they're mandatory.\n\n756\n00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,290\nThey're being enforced by the system.\n\n757\n00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:11,810\nNow, I am an admin so I could override\nthem, but a regular user can't.\n\n758\n00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:15,800\nA regular user can't override these\nmandatory access control lists.\n\n759\n00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:20,760\nBut, they can add to them if they want,\nthat's the discretionary part, right?\n\n760\n00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,210\nSo they can add to it, and they can say,\n\n761\n00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,740\nall right, well, you know what,\nthis is my Music folder.\n\n762\n00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:28,290\nI want everybody to have access to my\nMusic folder, so they can add, and\n\n763\n00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:31,370\nwe'll add in everyone, all right?\n\n764\n00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,650\nSo I'm going to add in this Everyone\ngroup, and give them read access.\n\n765\n00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:38,010\nSo Everyone, see how those\ncheck marks aren't grayed out.\n\n766\n00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:38,870\nI can change these.\n\n767\n00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,860\nI can come in and modify those.\n\n768\n00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:44,750\nBut if I take a look at Administrators >\nDon Pezet > System, those are grayed out.\n\n769\n00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,490\nThose are being defined by the system.\n\n770\n00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:49,220\nAll right, and in Windows,\nit's an inherited system.\n\n771\n00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,560\nIt's not like that in every OS.\n\n772\n00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,390\nBut that's what's going on there.\n\n773\n00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,498\nSo, mandatory access control lists and\n\n774\n00:39:55,498 --> 00:39:58,289\ndiscretionary access control\nlists work together.\n\n775\n00:39:58,289 --> 00:40:01,756\nThe difference just being\nthat a user can override and\n\n776\n00:40:01,756 --> 00:40:06,932\ninteract with discretionary access\ncontrol lists but not the mandatory ones.\n\n777\n00:40:06,932 --> 00:40:11,498\nAll right, so building on that,\nWe also have our rule based and\n\n778\n00:40:11,498 --> 00:40:17,550\nrole based access control list, all right,\nand these are really easy to confuse.\n\n779\n00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:22,563\nIn the example I showed you a moment ago,\nwhen we looked in that access control\n\n780\n00:40:22,563 --> 00:40:27,114\nlist, you saw Don Pezet in the list,\nokay, well that was a permission\n\n781\n00:40:27,114 --> 00:40:32,020\nthat was assigned to me specifically,\nto Don Pezet, all right.\n\n782\n00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:35,380\nBut, we could also assign\npermissions to groups.\n\n783\n00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,590\nSo you saw administrators or\nI created the everyone group, right.\n\n784\n00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,940\nThose are groups of users and\n\n785\n00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,780\nit allows us to sign permissions\nto multiple people at once.\n\n786\n00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,795\nAll right.\n\n787\n00:40:44,795 --> 00:40:47,830\nRoles are very similar to groups.\n\n788\n00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:51,830\nA role is what your job role\nis within a company, right.\n\n789\n00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:55,140\nWhat is your role in that organization?\n\n790\n00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,220\nNow that may sound a lot like a group.\n\n791\n00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,360\nBut there's a big difference you\nneed to remember for the exam.\n\n792\n00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,830\nA user can be in multiple groups.\n\n793\n00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,320\nYou can be in many groups.\n\n794\n00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,440\nBut a user can only have one role.\n\n795\n00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,670\nSo at IT Pro TV, I'm a host.\n\n796\n00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,540\nA show host.\n\n797\n00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,120\nAll right?\n\n798\n00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,300\nSo as a show host, I get a certain\nlevel of access here because well,\n\n799\n00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,425\nI need it, or just want it or\nfeel like it or they can't stop me.\n\n800\n00:41:19,425 --> 00:41:23,920\nSo, one of those reasons,\nbut I'm not a director.\n\n801\n00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,900\nI'm not.\nNot a receptionist, I'm not, you know,\n\n802\n00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,360\none of these other roles,\nI can't have that.\n\n803\n00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,600\nNow, I could go and put myself into\nvarious groups that said I was,\n\n804\n00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,050\nbut in real life I've only got one role.\n\n805\n00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,512\nThat's my role,\nthat the role I fill, here.\n\n806\n00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:41,190\nAll right, so role based access control\nis where we work based on that, you know,\n\n807\n00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,100\nwhat is your role?\n\n808\n00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,020\nWhat is the job function\ninside of an organization.\n\n809\n00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:49,240\nMost of the time, your software\nsystems like Windows and Linux,\n\n810\n00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,930\nthey don't know what your role is.\n\n811\n00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,860\nHey, how do they know\nwhat your job title is?\n\n812\n00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,170\nThey don't.\nThey know what groups you're in.\n\n813\n00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:56,420\nBut they don't necessarily\nknow your job titles.\n\n814\n00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,020\nAll right.\n\n815\n00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:01,390\nAnd so for something like that role based\naccess control is normally being performed\n\n816\n00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,410\nby something else.\n\n817\n00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:06,968\nSo for example we've got\ncontact locks on our doors.\n\n818\n00:42:06,968 --> 00:42:10,930\nSo you have a little key fob that's like\nan RFID tag that you wave in front of\n\n819\n00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:14,930\nthe door and it let's you in, all right,\nand we set up those keys based on your\n\n820\n00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:20,150\nrole here in the company, so\nif you're a IT Pro TV show host,\n\n821\n00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:24,210\nthen you've got access to the studios\nwhenever you want, right, but\n\n822\n00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:26,800\nif you're the cleaning personnel,\n\n823\n00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,350\nright, then you just have access on\nthe evenings and on the weekends.\n\n824\n00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,500\nWe don't want them to have access in\nthe middle of the day cuz they could walk\n\n825\n00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,920\nin while we were shooting, right?\n\n826\n00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,280\nSo that's their role and they get\naccess to the building based on that.\n\n827\n00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,410\nYou wouldn't have somebody\nwho was both a show host and\n\n828\n00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:44,920\ncleaning personnel, because then how would\nyou know when they get access, right?\n\n829\n00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,730\nSo that's why you can only have one role.\n\n830\n00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:52,158\nNow it's easy to confuse with\nrule-based access control.\n\n831\n00:42:52,158 --> 00:42:56,090\nRule-based access control is really,\nreally different.\n\n832\n00:42:56,090 --> 00:43:00,290\nIt's not based on what your user\naccount is or what group you're in.\n\n833\n00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:02,650\nIt's based on rules.\n\n834\n00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:04,280\nThings that we define.\n\n835\n00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,660\nAnd those rules can be\nall sorts of cool stuff.\n\n836\n00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:10,960\nYou can say, like,\nNate is allowed to access this file\n\n837\n00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,690\nif he's coming in over the network from\nthis particular work station, right?\n\n838\n00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:18,900\nYou can create really,\nreally in-depth rules like that.\n\n839\n00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,795\nThe most common type of rule What\nwe see is this one right here,\n\n840\n00:43:21,795 --> 00:43:23,755\ntime of day restrictions.\n\n841\n00:43:23,755 --> 00:43:30,095\nFor example, with like a wireless network,\nwe might say that ITpro TV show\n\n842\n00:43:30,095 --> 00:43:34,310\nhosts have access to the wireless network\nMonday through Friday from eight to five.\n\n843\n00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:37,160\nRight, when we're shooting shows but\n\n844\n00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,930\nafter that they don't have\naccess to the wireless network.\n\n845\n00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:42,610\nIf they come in at ten pm,\nthey don't get that access.\n\n846\n00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:45,740\nYou create a time of day\nrestriction which is a rule,\n\n847\n00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,780\nthat's rule based access control,\nall right.\n\n848\n00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,650\nReally easy to confuse those and\nmix them up and even the whole group\n\n849\n00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:55,720\nthing get's it even more confusing so\nrules, we define the rules.\n\n850\n00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,120\nWe define whatever we want them to be.\n\n851\n00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:01,530\nRole-based, your users have\none role within the company,\n\n852\n00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,438\nwhatever role it is they fill, and\nthey get access based on that role.\n\n853\n00:44:04,438 --> 00:44:05,534\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n854\n00:44:05,534 --> 00:44:07,125\n>> All right.\n\n855\n00:44:07,125 --> 00:44:09,285\nI found, like for me,\nwhen I was studying for\n\n856\n00:44:09,285 --> 00:44:12,985\nthis exam, I got Security Plus certified\na long time ago, but when I was studying,\n\n857\n00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:16,305\nand this was one of the hardest parts for\nme, I just had to memorize it, and to this\n\n858\n00:44:16,305 --> 00:44:19,635\nday it, that's what I've got, I got it\nmemorized in my head, so I know which one\n\n859\n00:44:19,635 --> 00:44:23,255\nis which and that's probably something\na lot of you will have to do also.\n\n860\n00:44:24,265 --> 00:44:24,765\n>> Hm.\n\n861\n00:44:26,105 --> 00:44:29,095\n>> All right, so\nthat takes care of authorization.\n\n862\n00:44:29,095 --> 00:44:32,890\nWhen somebody connects to the network, we\nhave to figure out what they're authorized\n\n863\n00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:36,230\nto do and it's these access control\nlists that are going to define that.\n\n864\n00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:38,650\nThat's going to define\nwhat they have access to.\n\n865\n00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:39,470\nAnd I kind of gave you some\n\n866\n00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:41,640\ndifferent scenarios where\nwe would use each of these.\n\n867\n00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,430\nAnd that's what you want to remember for\nthe exam is\n\n868\n00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:48,170\ngiven a scenario which scenario\nwould one of these be appropriate?\n\n869\n00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:52,999\nAll right so if I wanted to make sure that\nemployees could only vpn into my office\n\n870\n00:44:52,999 --> 00:44:58,150\nBetween one and three p.m., which of\nthese would be appropriate for me?\n\n871\n00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,480\nWell, definitely a time\nof day restriction and\n\n872\n00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,940\nthat's a type of rule\nbased access control.\n\n873\n00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:04,840\nThose would be the two that\nare appropriate, right?\n\n874\n00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,849\nSo understand what each one does and\nknow when to use them.\n\n875\n00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:09,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n876\n00:45:11,212 --> 00:45:14,130\n>> All right now, I know we kind\nof moved past authentication, but\n\n877\n00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:17,420\nthere is another section here on\nauthentication with the different ways\n\n878\n00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:19,450\nthat people can authenticate, right.\n\n879\n00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:24,180\nAnd we already saw one way, which was\nthe user name and the password, right.\n\n880\n00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,400\nI punched in a user\nname to that router and\n\n881\n00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,430\nthen I punched in a password\non top of that, right.\n\n882\n00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,760\nWe, once we authenticate,\nthen we get a token.\n\n883\n00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,150\nAnd we use that token to\nauthenticate beyond there, and so\n\n884\n00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:35,710\nthat's why they call out tokens here.\n\n885\n00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:38,820\nAnd really any username password\ncombination is gonna generate that token.\n\n886\n00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,700\nSo that kind of falls under there.\n\n887\n00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,875\nBut there are other ways to do it.\n\n888\n00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:45,365\nLike you've got CACs, common access cards.\n\n889\n00:45:45,365 --> 00:45:48,145\nThose are pretty common in like,\nmilitary installations and\n\n890\n00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:52,705\nhospitals where you have a name badge and\nthe name badge has a magnetic stripe\n\n891\n00:45:52,705 --> 00:45:55,967\non it that you can swipe at doors to get\nyou access to the various buildings and\n\n892\n00:45:55,967 --> 00:45:58,787\nfacilities in your organization, right?\n\n893\n00:45:58,787 --> 00:46:01,397\nThere's also smart cards,\nwhich are more advanced.\n\n894\n00:46:01,397 --> 00:46:04,483\nWith a smart card,\nyou actually have a microchip on there and\n\n895\n00:46:04,483 --> 00:46:06,066\nit can store a good bit of data.\n\n896\n00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:10,478\nA pretty common practice is to store\na certificate, an X.509 certificate, so\n\n897\n00:46:10,478 --> 00:46:14,637\nit can do authentication for who you are,\nas well as handle things like serve as\n\n898\n00:46:14,637 --> 00:46:18,181\na private key for doing encryption and\ndecryption on the network.\n\n899\n00:46:18,181 --> 00:46:20,300\nYou get really a lot\nmore power out of that.\n\n900\n00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,340\nWe're starting to see\ncredit cards move to that.\n\n901\n00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,550\nRight?\nWith the PIN chip\n\n902\n00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:25,985\nauthentication on credit cards,\nor authorization.\n\n903\n00:46:25,985 --> 00:46:29,510\nSo you'll start to see that more and\nmore commonly in the future.\n\n904\n00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:33,970\n>> Yeah, you know Don, the next one down\nthere, that multifactor authentication.\n\n905\n00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:38,790\nYou know really stepping down in\nthe list into the authentication factors\n\n906\n00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:43,890\nreally is the multifactor\nauthentication is taking more than one.\n\n907\n00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:47,860\nAnd, yeah, using more than one\nmethod to authenticate yourself.\n\n908\n00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,960\nSo that way you only\nhave to have two things.\n\n909\n00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:50,690\n>> Yeah.\n\n910\n00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:55,190\nI think we've seen, if you read\nthe tech news at all, I think you've\n\n911\n00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:59,110\nprobably noticed in the last year that\nthe days of just having a username and\n\n912\n00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:00,980\npassword are ending, right?\n\n913\n00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:04,180\nThat passwords are very easy to capture.\n\n914\n00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,630\nYou can use key loggers and\nother ways to get those passwords, and\n\n915\n00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:11,570\nonce you have somebody's user name and\npassword, it's all over from there, right.\n\n916\n00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:15,550\nYou can get into their systems,\nyou can really start to do some damage.\n\n917\n00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:19,300\nSo more and more systems are moving\nto multifactor authentication,\n\n918\n00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,210\nwhere you need two things\nto identify yourself.\n\n919\n00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:23,770\nNow you might say, wait a minutes Don.\n\n920\n00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:24,780\nUser name and password, right?\n\n921\n00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,780\nThat's two things.\n\n922\n00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,740\nWell, user name and\npassword are used in combination, right?\n\n923\n00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:32,150\nThe password is tied to the user account\nso it really just counts as one thing.\n\n924\n00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:35,387\nAnd our user names are not\nnormally secret, right?\n\n925\n00:47:35,387 --> 00:47:36,344\nThey're something that we share.\n\n926\n00:47:36,344 --> 00:47:38,468\nMore commonly their our email address,\nright?\n\n927\n00:47:38,468 --> 00:47:41,120\nYou see that more and more,\nlike if you have a Gmail account.\n\n928\n00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,520\nYour username is your email account so\neverybody knows it.\n\n929\n00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,810\nSo, usernames don't really count.\n\n930\n00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:47,480\nIt's that password and\nthe token that you get.\n\n931\n00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,730\nThat's one form of authentication.\n\n932\n00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:51,800\nSo, what about multifactor?\n\n933\n00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,300\nWell there's a lot of ways to go\nabout multifactor authentication.\n\n934\n00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:58,260\nOne that I'm seeing a lot lately is SMS.\n\n935\n00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:59,570\nRight?\n\n936\n00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:01,720\nI know Twitter and Facebook do it.\n\n937\n00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,520\nMicrosoft does it.\n\n938\n00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,390\nWho else does it?\n\n939\n00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:06,193\nThere's a couple of other ones.\n\n940\n00:48:06,193 --> 00:48:07,598\nSteam is doing email now.\n\n941\n00:48:07,598 --> 00:48:09,421\nSteam, very important to us here.\n\n942\n00:48:09,421 --> 00:48:11,336\nSo, but with SMS.\n\n943\n00:48:11,336 --> 00:48:13,241\nYou go to log in.\n\n944\n00:48:13,241 --> 00:48:14,680\nYou provide an username and password.\n\n945\n00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:18,955\nAnd then it says hey, we just sent you\na text message to your phone with a code.\n\n946\n00:48:18,955 --> 00:48:21,540\nType in the code right here.\n\n947\n00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:25,465\nAnd so you've gotta have your username and\npassword and that code.\n\n948\n00:48:25,465 --> 00:48:27,895\nAnd you won't get that code unless you've\ngot your cell phone to receive that\n\n949\n00:48:27,895 --> 00:48:28,755\ntext message.\n\n950\n00:48:28,755 --> 00:48:31,245\nSo now you've gotta have two things,\nright?\n\n951\n00:48:31,245 --> 00:48:33,695\nYou and your username and password, and\n\n952\n00:48:33,695 --> 00:48:35,515\nyour cell phone to be able\nto receive that code.\n\n953\n00:48:35,515 --> 00:48:36,935\nThat's multi-factor authentication.\n\n954\n00:48:38,177 --> 00:48:40,037\nWith steam you go to login.\n\n955\n00:48:40,037 --> 00:48:42,717\nIf you have Steam Guard turned on,\nwhere you have your username and\n\n956\n00:48:42,717 --> 00:48:46,087\npassword and then when you\nlog in it sends you an email.\n\n957\n00:48:46,087 --> 00:48:48,967\nAnd you've got to go into your email,\nand check ,and get the code,\n\n958\n00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:49,577\nand punch that in.\n\n959\n00:48:49,577 --> 00:48:51,557\nSo now you've got your username and\nyour password, and\n\n960\n00:48:51,557 --> 00:48:53,327\nthe code they just emailed you.\n\n961\n00:48:53,327 --> 00:48:57,007\nNow the thing in common between those\nbetween the emailed code and the text\n\n962\n00:48:57,007 --> 00:49:02,760\nmessage code is that they're what are\ncalled OTPs or one time passwords, right?\n\n963\n00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,320\nThose codes only work one time.\n\n964\n00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:09,590\nSo if somebody were to intercept that\ncode, if you've already used it,\n\n965\n00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,110\nit's gone, it's not valid anymore.\n\n966\n00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,670\nSo if somebody intercepts the code,\nbig deal,\n\n967\n00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:15,890\nwho cares if they got it\nbecause it's not valid anymore.\n\n968\n00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:19,280\nOne time passwords used\nto be expensive and\n\n969\n00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,300\ndifficult to implement, but\nnow they're becoming common place.\n\n970\n00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,800\nAnd so we're seeing them more and\n\n971\n00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,590\nmore, and it's a good idea\nto make use of them, right?\n\n972\n00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:29,770\nDual factor authentication is a great\nway to ensure that your account doesn't\n\n973\n00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,050\nget compromised.\n\n974\n00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:31,765\nAll right.\n\n975\n00:49:31,765 --> 00:49:33,870\nNow I did read this article\njust a few weeks ago.\n\n976\n00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:38,650\nThere was a journalist, right.\n\n977\n00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:40,040\nI couldn't find the word there.\n\n978\n00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,105\nA guy who writes articles for a magazine.\n\n979\n00:49:42,105 --> 00:49:44,070\nAnd he had posted an article.\n\n980\n00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:46,370\nThis was somewhere in New York, like\nNew York Times or something like that.\n\n981\n00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:48,010\nAnd he posted an article and he said.\n\n982\n00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:49,300\nBoy security is so\n\n983\n00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:53,460\ngreat, that with Twitter we now\nhave multifactor authentication.\n\n984\n00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,110\nThat I get a text message code.\n\n985\n00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:59,377\nSo I can actually print my user name and\npassword right here in this magazine, and\n\n986\n00:49:59,377 --> 00:50:03,030\nI don't have to worry about\nmy account getting hacked.\n\n987\n00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:04,850\nSo he did that, he put his user name and\n\n988\n00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:07,490\nhis password right there\nout in the public.\n\n989\n00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:09,340\nSo that anybody could see it, and\n\n990\n00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:13,110\nhe knew, if somebody tried to log in,\nthe text message would come to him.\n\n991\n00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:16,990\nThey wouldn't see it and they wouldn't be\nable to log in, and he was right, okay,\n\n992\n00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:23,350\nbut what he didn't expect was that\nhe got thousands of text messages.\n\n993\n00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:26,420\nThousands of people trying\nto log in as his account and\n\n994\n00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:30,190\nhe effectively created a denial\nof service on his own self.\n\n995\n00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:31,330\nHe couldn't log in.\n\n996\n00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:37,040\nBecause he was receiving so many codes on\nhis phone that when he tried to log in,\n\n997\n00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,675\nhe couldn't because he didn't know\nwhich code was the right one,\n\n998\n00:50:39,675 --> 00:50:43,250\ncuz he was receiving, he said it\nwas something like ten per minute.\n\n999\n00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,540\nIt was a ridiculous number.\n\n1000\n00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:49,230\nAnd the people weren't getting into his\naccount, he didn't get hacked, right?\n\n1001\n00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:52,510\nBut people were trying it and\nthat's kind of the risk.\n\n1002\n00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:55,305\nSo you don't want to get too\ncocky with this stuff, right?\n\n1003\n00:50:55,305 --> 00:50:57,470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You always do need to remember that,\n\n1004\n00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:00,600\nand when you have dual factor\nyou're dependent on both factors.\n\n1005\n00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,770\nRemember how like if you forget\nyour password you're locked out?\n\n1006\n00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:06,370\nWell what if you lose your OTP device?\n\n1007\n00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:08,000\nRight?\nWell then you're locked out.\n\n1008\n00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,880\nSo you've got to have some kind of\nbackup mechanism to be able to get in.\n\n1009\n00:51:11,998 --> 00:51:13,650\nAll right.\n\n1010\n00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:18,670\nI'd like to talk about some of\nthe one time password devices,\n\n1011\n00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:20,350\nand tokens, and stuff like that.\n\n1012\n00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:22,700\nBut I know we're running a little\nbit low on time on this segment.\n\n1013\n00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,740\nSo why don't we stop and\ntake a break and when we get back,\n\n1014\n00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:29,260\nI want to show you guys some examples of\nthese really neat stuff that's out there\n\n1015\n00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,960\nand definitely some cool things.\n\n1016\n00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,720\nSo yeah,\nyou got anything to add before we stop?\n\n1017\n00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,170\nOkay, cool.\n\n1018\n00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:37,400\nAll right so stay tuned.\n\n1019\n00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,386\nWe'll be back in a few.\n\n1020\n00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:45,688\n[MUSIC]\n\n1021\n00:51:45,688 --> 00:51:47,410\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1022\n00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:50,270\nSo before the break we started\ntalking about authentication and\n\n1023\n00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:54,130\nwe talked about smart cards and\nand things like that.\n\n1024\n00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:56,580\nWhat I want to dive into\nnow are one-time passwords.\n\n1025\n00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:01,540\nAnd I gave the example earlier of\nlike SMS or email where you get\n\n1026\n00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:05,720\na code emailed to you or a code texted\nto you at the time of your login.\n\n1027\n00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,570\nAll right?\n\n1028\n00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:09,350\nNow that sounds like a pretty\neffective mechanism to use, but\n\n1029\n00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:10,630\nthere's a few problems with it.\n\n1030\n00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:11,390\nAll right.\n\n1031\n00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:16,420\nFirst off, it's dependent on some other\nservice like your cellphone which\n\n1032\n00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,080\nyou may not have or it may not work.\n\n1033\n00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,390\nIt also, your email.\n\n1034\n00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:21,816\nAnd if you're using the same username and\npassword on your email,\n\n1035\n00:52:21,816 --> 00:52:24,350\nthen all of a sudden the code's\nusefulness is negated.\n\n1036\n00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,560\nThe other problem is,\nit can take a while to get an email or\n\n1037\n00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,620\nit can take a while to get\na text message in some cases.\n\n1038\n00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:36,790\nSo those one time passwords they issue you\nare often good for long periods of time.\n\n1039\n00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:40,760\nFor example I think the steam ones\nare good for like 30 minutes or something.\n\n1040\n00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,372\nDo you know Nate?\n\n1041\n00:52:41,372 --> 00:52:42,650\n>> Right, no.\n\n1042\n00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:44,616\n>> I know the Twitter ones are good for\na little while.\n\n1043\n00:52:44,616 --> 00:52:45,173\nSo-\n>> Right.\n\n1044\n00:52:45,173 --> 00:52:48,548\n>> So they can be good for a long window\nof time which makes it easier for\n\n1045\n00:52:48,548 --> 00:52:50,081\nan attacker to exploit them.\n\n1046\n00:52:50,081 --> 00:52:51,120\nAll right?\n\n1047\n00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:57,640\nSo a better option to use is\na hardware token or a code generator.\n\n1048\n00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:02,110\nThese are programs that are constantly\ngenerating codes for you.\n\n1049\n00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:06,450\nAnd instead of just generating them at the\ntime of use, you're doing it all the time.\n\n1050\n00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:09,990\nSo one of the best examples of\nthese is from the company RSA.\n\n1051\n00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:16,080\nRSA has what are called secure ID\ntokens and they generate new codes.\n\n1052\n00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,180\nIt depends on the one you buy.\n\n1053\n00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:20,390\nBut either every 30 seconds or\nevery 60 seconds.\n\n1054\n00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:23,530\nSo the longest the codes are good for\nis one minute.\n\n1055\n00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:29,050\nYou can use the code during that window,\nand as soon as that window of time is up.\n\n1056\n00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:30,570\nAnother code is generated and\n\n1057\n00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:35,460\nso you're basically getting a new\npassword every 30 or 60 seconds.\n\n1058\n00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,430\nRight?\nThat is\n\n1059\n00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:39,530\nway faster than we can\nnormally do it as humans.\n\n1060\n00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:41,760\nNow it sounds like that would be\nfrustrating but it's really not that bad.\n\n1061\n00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,170\nLet me show you what those look like.\n\n1062\n00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:46,810\nI've got the RSA site pulled\nup somewhere around here.\n\n1063\n00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:47,310\nThere we go.\n\n1064\n00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:52,530\nAnd they show on this site a couple\nof examples of their tokens.\n\n1065\n00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,830\nAnd it'll get a little\nblurry here I imagine but\n\n1066\n00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:56,600\nthey have ones that\nlook like credit cards.\n\n1067\n00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,320\nSo you can stick them right in your\nwallet and they're not very big.\n\n1068\n00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:03,350\nThis type right here is\ndisplaying a six digit number and\n\n1069\n00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:05,890\nit's a little hard to see, but\nthere's some bars over here\n\n1070\n00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:10,410\nwhich are ticking down to let you know\nhow much longer that code is good for.\n\n1071\n00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:15,130\nWhen you go to login, you login with\nyour username and your password.\n\n1072\n00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:18,510\nAnd when you're using\nRSA Secure ID Tokens your password\n\n1073\n00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:20,570\nis actually made up of two pieces.\n\n1074\n00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:24,350\nOne piece,\nis the code right here on the card and\n\n1075\n00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:28,390\nthe other piece,\nis a pin number that you memorize.\n\n1076\n00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:33,870\nSo if my pin number is 1234, when I log\nin I would log in with user name D Pezet,\n\n1077\n00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:38,890\npassword 8745871234 right?\n\n1078\n00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:42,625\nBut in the 30 seconds or 60 seconds,\nthis code will change and\n\n1079\n00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:45,255\nit'll become a new code\nlike this one down here.\n\n1080\n00:54:45,255 --> 00:54:49,271\nAnd then I would log in with\npassword 5785871234 right,\n\n1081\n00:54:49,271 --> 00:54:51,321\nthat would be my new code, right.\n\n1082\n00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:54,910\nSo your password is constantly changing,\nand if somebody uses\n\n1083\n00:54:54,910 --> 00:55:00,030\na keystroke logger and captures your key\nwell, they got your PIN number, sure.\n\n1084\n00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,810\nBut they didn't get your code.\n\n1085\n00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:03,530\nWell, maybe they did get your code.\n\n1086\n00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:04,100\nRight?\n\n1087\n00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,781\nBut your code is changing every 30 or\n60 seconds.\n\n1088\n00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:08,920\nAnd the other thing is\nthey're one time passwords.\n\n1089\n00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,000\nYou've already used it.\n\n1090\n00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,705\nIt's only good once.\n\n1091\n00:55:11,705 --> 00:55:14,335\nIf they want to login they've got to\nwait until they wait until the next code\n\n1092\n00:55:14,335 --> 00:55:16,030\nis generated which they don't have.\n\n1093\n00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:21,100\nSo it renders keystroke loggers\nineffective though very useful, right?\n\n1094\n00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,870\nNow, on this card here,\nthe display is always on.\n\n1095\n00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:28,420\nSo if somebody steals your wallet,\nthey've got the code right there.\n\n1096\n00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:31,400\nSo they've got that, if they can combine\nit with the key stroke logger to get your\n\n1097\n00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,210\npin number, now they've gotten in.\n\n1098\n00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:37,090\nSo they make more advanced ones like\nthis one, and you'll see it's got number\n\n1099\n00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:41,080\nkeys on it, and that's because\nthe display is actually off.\n\n1100\n00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,990\nAnd you punch in a pin number,\nand then it shows your code,\n\n1101\n00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:45,800\nright there on the screen.\n\n1102\n00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:50,930\nSo it's actually hiding those codes,\nan extra level of security, right.\n\n1103\n00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:54,070\nThese are the credit card ones,\nI don't like them as much.\n\n1104\n00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:55,290\nI like the key chain ones.\n\n1105\n00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:58,960\nThese are the key chain ones, and\nyou'll see their just a simple key chain.\n\n1106\n00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,110\nThey can go through the wash,\ntheir waterproof.\n\n1107\n00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:05,240\nAnd they display the code just\nlike the credit card sized ones.\n\n1108\n00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,356\nThis one has USB on it.\n\n1109\n00:56:06,356 --> 00:56:09,287\nYou can actually plug it in and\nit'll handle automatic logins for\n\n1110\n00:56:09,287 --> 00:56:10,730\nlike single sign on solutions.\n\n1111\n00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:12,983\nSo that kind of a neat\nfeature if you need it.\n\n1112\n00:56:12,983 --> 00:56:15,310\nThese are the ones that I've\ntypically used over the years.\n\n1113\n00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:19,641\n>> Now Don, there's also a poor man's way,\nI guess you would say that.\n\n1114\n00:56:19,641 --> 00:56:22,304\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As far as implementing this with things\n\n1115\n00:56:22,304 --> 00:56:24,753\nlike, there's apps, smartphone apps,\n\n1116\n00:56:24,753 --> 00:56:27,920\nGoogle Authenticator is\none that comes to mind.\n\n1117\n00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,280\nAnd Google Authenticator,\nit ties into your Google account.\n\n1118\n00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,440\nAnd so they sync up together and\nthe app on the,\n\n1119\n00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,550\non the smartphone will rotate through\nnumbers and it kinda ticks down.\n\n1120\n00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:40,415\nAnd so whenever you go to\nlogin to an account, and\n\n1121\n00:56:40,415 --> 00:56:42,974\nI believe that you can set it up to\nwork with other services as well.\n\n1122\n00:56:42,974 --> 00:56:43,567\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so\n\n1123\n00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:47,480\nyou basically use that as your\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n1124\n00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,390\n>> Yeah,\nI've got their page pulled up right here.\n\n1125\n00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:51,200\nI use Google Authenticator myself.\n\n1126\n00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,750\nYou can use it with your Google account.\n\n1127\n00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,860\nSo when you log into Gmail or whatever,\nyou've got to provide that code.\n\n1128\n00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,840\nBut I use it with LastPass also.\n\n1129\n00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,010\nAnd so just like they're showing here\nin this picture where they've got\n\n1130\n00:57:01,010 --> 00:57:02,450\ntwo accounts added.\n\n1131\n00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,420\nAnd it's just like the secure ID tokens,\n\n1132\n00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:08,760\nthese codes are changing every 60 seconds\nor 30 or whatever it defaults to.\n\n1133\n00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,950\nSo they're changing, and all you have\nto do is look at that when you log in.\n\n1134\n00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:14,740\nThe advantage of Google Authenticator is\nthat you don't have to buy any hardware.\n\n1135\n00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:16,465\nSo that's why Nate said,\nit's like the poor man's.\n\n1136\n00:57:16,465 --> 00:57:17,710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not like it's worse,\n\n1137\n00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:18,820\nit's just as good.\n\n1138\n00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:20,850\nRight?\nIt's done in software right there on your\n\n1139\n00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:22,620\nphone and you see the code.\n\n1140\n00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:24,710\nYou punch it in to login, so\nthat's part of their two step.\n\n1141\n00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,162\nGoogle has been trying to make\nthis more and more open so\n\n1142\n00:57:28,162 --> 00:57:30,670\nother people can support it,\nlike LastPass does.\n\n1143\n00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:34,510\nBut many other websites out there don't\nsupport it yet, like Twitter and Facebook.\n\n1144\n00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:38,110\nThey have their own mechanisms and they\ndon't support the Google Authenticator.\n\n1145\n00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:40,880\nAll right,\nthere's also other companies out there.\n\n1146\n00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,777\nYubiKey is a,\nis one that's pretty popular,\n\n1147\n00:57:42,777 --> 00:57:44,490\nbecause they're fairly low-cost too.\n\n1148\n00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:48,290\nTheir key is they have\nlike the YubiKey standard.\n\n1149\n00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:49,200\nWhoops.\n\n1150\n00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:54,030\nWhich is about 25 bucks and\nI thought I would get a picture, but no.\n\n1151\n00:57:54,030 --> 00:57:55,110\nThere we go, a picture.\n\n1152\n00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:57,200\nSo, theirs is about 25 bucks.\n\n1153\n00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,650\nNotice it doesn't have a screen.\n\n1154\n00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:04,230\nThe way it works is you plug it into\na USB port on your computer and\n\n1155\n00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,080\nit just has one button.\n\n1156\n00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:08,620\nAll right, it emulates a keyboard, and so\n\n1157\n00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:13,130\nwhen you tap that button, it just\nautomatically types the code in for you.\n\n1158\n00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:14,910\nSo you don't have to go in and\ntype the code in.\n\n1159\n00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:19,130\nOne of the frustrating parts of the RSA\nones, if the code's about to expire,\n\n1160\n00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,960\nit takes you longer to type\nit when the code expires.\n\n1161\n00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,810\nYou just have to wait for the next one.\n\n1162\n00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:24,200\nWith YubiKey, you never have to do that.\n\n1163\n00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,690\nYou don't care what the code is.\n\n1164\n00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:26,770\nYou don't need to see it.\n\n1165\n00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:30,510\nYou pop it in the computer, you tap the\nbutton, and it types the code in for you.\n\n1166\n00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:31,280\nAll right now,\n\n1167\n00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,580\nthe only negative about this is you can't\nuse it on something like a mobile device.\n\n1168\n00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:39,540\nAnd so, that's where they have the YubiKey\nNeo, which is this guy right here,\n\n1169\n00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,140\nwhich has NFC built into it.\n\n1170\n00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:46,020\nAnd the NFC is nice because you\ncan just tap it to your phone and\n\n1171\n00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,080\nit'll send that code into your phone.\n\n1172\n00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:51,680\nSo you can use it to do dual-factor\nauthentication on your phone also.\n\n1173\n00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,932\nSo it's kind of a nice little feature.\n\n1174\n00:58:52,932 --> 00:58:57,430\nAll right, now I mentioned Google tries\nto be really open with theirs, but\n\n1175\n00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:58,780\nnot everybody supports it.\n\n1176\n00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:05,000\nThere is a new standard that's coming\nout called U2F, Universal 2nd Factor.\n\n1177\n00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,770\nAnd this is where a lot of companies\nare starting to bond together.\n\n1178\n00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:13,470\nTo make it where you can have a single\ntoken generator that works across multiple\n\n1179\n00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:15,610\nsites and\ngives you true dual-factor authentication,\n\n1180\n00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:17,110\nwithout having to have a bunch of tokens.\n\n1181\n00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:20,530\nAll right, so you're gonna start\nseeing that over the next year or two.\n\n1182\n00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:23,290\nYubiKey has announced they're gonna be\nsupporting it by the end of the year, but\n\n1183\n00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:25,440\nthey don't support it as of today.\n\n1184\n00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,220\nSo if you buy one of those tokens,\nit won't do U2F yet.\n\n1185\n00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:32,060\nSo, look for that, if you're gonna be\ndeploying this in the future, look for\n\n1186\n00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:34,002\nU2F compatibility, it'll be nice to have.\n\n1187\n00:59:34,002 --> 00:59:38,480\nAll right, I think Google Authenticator\nis working on it also, so\n\n1188\n00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,190\nyou'll start to see that\ncoming down the pipe.\n\n1189\n00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:41,730\n>> Nice.\n>> All right,\n\n1190\n00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:45,720\nso those are a couple of examples\nof dual-factor authentication.\n\n1191\n00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:50,210\nAnd the nice part there is, if somebody\ngets your password it's not everything.\n\n1192\n00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:54,760\nOkay, now when you do these,\nyou're really using one-time passwords,\n\n1193\n00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,850\npasswords that are only good one time.\n\n1194\n00:59:56,850 --> 00:59:59,080\nAnd there's two types\nof one-time passwords.\n\n1195\n00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:04,220\nThere's TOTP and\nHOTP which are time-based, and HMAC.\n\n1196\n01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:07,540\nYou'll hear some people call\nit just hash-based, right.\n\n1197\n01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:08,990\nHMAC is a hashing algorithm.\n\n1198\n01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:13,690\nAnd so, when we do these, the time-based\nones, that means that when you generate\n\n1199\n01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:17,500\nthat password it's only good for a certain\namount of time and that's it, right.\n\n1200\n01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:21,150\nAnd then over time new ones get issued and\nthat's the way that you go with.\n\n1201\n01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,970\nWith HMAC, it's hash-based.\n\n1202\n01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:26,340\nAnd so you generate a code hash and\n\n1203\n01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:28,670\nit needs to match the code\nhash that's on the server.\n\n1204\n01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:30,510\nWhich means,\nyou just have to have the same algorithm.\n\n1205\n01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:32,660\nYou have to have the same\nseed on both sides.\n\n1206\n01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:35,780\nTime is not the element\nthat determines it.\n\n1207\n01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:38,970\nAll right so, we had a question in\nthe chat room about how would this affect\n\n1208\n01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:40,880\nremote desktop use, right.\n\n1209\n01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,097\nThere's a, there's a great example of an\narea where multi-factor authentication is\n\n1210\n01:00:44,097 --> 01:00:45,250\nreally handy.\n\n1211\n01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:48,880\nIf you have your home computer set up,\nI know, I do this.\n\n1212\n01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,362\nI always worry about saying\nthings like this on the show.\n\n1213\n01:00:51,362 --> 01:00:52,640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I do this where\n\n1214\n01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:56,230\nI have a desktop at home, and\nI have it set up with remote desktop, so\n\n1215\n01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:59,700\nthat I can remote into it from outside.\n\n1216\n01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,620\nSo, if I'm somewhere on\nsomebody else's network,\n\n1217\n01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:04,040\nI can remote in to get to my\nmachine at home, all right.\n\n1218\n01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:07,110\nWell, the Remote Desktop Protocol\nuses Port 3389.\n\n1219\n01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:08,690\nMost people know that.\n\n1220\n01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:11,180\nAttackers can scan and find it real fast.\n\n1221\n01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:14,080\nSo the odds are, there are attackers\nthat are out there that know that I have\n\n1222\n01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,840\nthat port open on my machine.\n\n1223\n01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,880\nIt'll allow anybody to connect and\n\n1224\n01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,550\nthey can then attempt to brute\nforce their way into the machine.\n\n1225\n01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:22,040\nThat's a, that's a risk, right?\n\n1226\n01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,072\nThey can sit there and\njust try passwords to get in.\n\n1227\n01:01:24,072 --> 01:01:28,200\nAll right well, I have a firewall in\nplace and I use that to control access.\n\n1228\n01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,230\nSo I have some advanced rules.\n\n1229\n01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:35,050\nYou can create firewall rules that are\nreally neat called triggered rules that\n\n1230\n01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:38,320\nwon't open port 3389 unless\nanother event happens.\n\n1231\n01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:41,570\nThat's what I use, is I do a separate\nsession to wake up the port and\n\n1232\n01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:43,770\nthen I connect in so\nthat kind of protects me.\n\n1233\n01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:45,930\nBut if you have dual-factor\nauthentication,\n\n1234\n01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:47,350\nit gets you around that, right.\n\n1235\n01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:52,130\nWell, Windows doesn't natively\nsupport dual-factor authentication.\n\n1236\n01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:54,740\nBut a lot of these manufacturers like RSA,\n\n1237\n01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:59,170\nthey write software that replaces\nthe authentication mechanism for Windows.\n\n1238\n01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:02,870\nAnd that means when you login,\nyou can now login with your user name and\n\n1239\n01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:08,002\na password that is your code number,\nyour token number and your pin number.\n\n1240\n01:02:08,002 --> 01:02:10,390\nAll right, in the Linux world,\nit's a lot easier.\n\n1241\n01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:15,440\nBecause in the Linux world, Linux supports\nauthenticating as a radius server.\n\n1242\n01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,220\nAnd the RSA secure ID servers,\nthey're just radius, that's all they are.\n\n1243\n01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:22,450\nAnd so you can have it where your\nmachine authenticates against radius and\n\n1244\n01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:25,570\nwhether you remote in or whether you set\nin locally you can, you can authenticate.\n\n1245\n01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:29,222\nSo you get different levels of\ncompatibility from different vendors but\n\n1246\n01:02:29,222 --> 01:02:31,010\nthey're all working towards that.\n\n1247\n01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:33,005\nSo we'll see that get better\nover the next couple of years.\n\n1248\n01:02:33,005 --> 01:02:34,780\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1249\n01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:39,400\n>> So all right, there are other\nways to handle authentication.\n\n1250\n01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,280\nThe old ways, right?\n\n1251\n01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:46,480\nLike CHAP and PAP, CHAP is the Challenge\nHandshake Authentication Protocol.\n\n1252\n01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:51,170\nAnd it was a replacement to PAP, which\nwas the Password Authentication Protocol.\n\n1253\n01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:54,860\nBack in the dial-up days, way back,\nright, we're talking about in the 80s.\n\n1254\n01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:57,240\nWhen you dialed up into a system and\nhad to provide a username and\n\n1255\n01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,870\npassword, you typically used\nPassword Authentication Protocol.\n\n1256\n01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:05,060\nCommunications then were handled over\npoint-to-point phone lines, right.\n\n1257\n01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:08,440\nYou called into a computer and\nyou'd send a user name and password.\n\n1258\n01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:11,300\nNobody could really intercept that\nbecause it was point to point.\n\n1259\n01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,040\nIt was just you and the other end.\n\n1260\n01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,870\nSomebody would have to tap your phone\nlines and gather data that way, was very,\n\n1261\n01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:16,880\nvery difficult.\n\n1262\n01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,035\nSo PAP is plain text.\n\n1263\n01:03:19,035 --> 01:03:22,700\nSent your username and password without\nencrypting it at all, just plain text,\n\n1264\n01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,830\nright on the line.\n\n1265\n01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:25,720\nSo in today's world, PAP is dead.\n\n1266\n01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,550\nYou really don't wanna use PAP\nif you can avoid it, right?\n\n1267\n01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:32,860\nUnless you're securing your system\nsome other way, like SSL or IPsec or\n\n1268\n01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:34,800\nwhatever, then it's okay to use PAP.\n\n1269\n01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:39,320\nBut if you're, if you're not then\nPAP is plain text, it's bad news.\n\n1270\n01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:40,906\nSo CHAP was designed to replace that.\n\n1271\n01:03:40,906 --> 01:03:44,250\nThat is Challenge Handshake and instead\nof sending your password across the line,\n\n1272\n01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:47,320\nit sends a hashed copy of your password.\n\n1273\n01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:50,670\nIt takes your password, runs it through\nan algorithm, generates a hash and\n\n1274\n01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:52,170\nsends that to the other side.\n\n1275\n01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:55,220\nThe other side hashes the password\nthey have stored locally and\n\n1276\n01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:56,790\nthey compare the hashes.\n\n1277\n01:03:56,790 --> 01:03:59,990\nSo your password never\nactually crosses the network,\n\n1278\n01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:02,300\nwhich makes this far more secure.\n\n1279\n01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:03,926\nThe other thing is it supports\na challenge mechanism.\n\n1280\n01:04:03,926 --> 01:04:08,323\nSo not only do you have to authenticate\nagainst the person you're connecting to,\n\n1281\n01:04:08,323 --> 01:04:10,693\nbut they have to authenticate against you.\n\n1282\n01:04:10,693 --> 01:04:11,412\nTwo way.\n\n1283\n01:04:11,412 --> 01:04:14,002\nSo you get non repudiation there.\n\n1284\n01:04:14,002 --> 01:04:16,497\nYou verify both end\npoints in a connection.\n\n1285\n01:04:16,497 --> 01:04:19,260\nCHAP is still used today.\n\n1286\n01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:20,130\nIt's very common.\n\n1287\n01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:24,340\nLike if you set up an iSCSI SAN,\nalmost all iSCSI SAN's use CHAP for\n\n1288\n01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,350\ntheir authentication, for\nthe iSCSI connection.\n\n1289\n01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:28,060\nThis is very very common.\n\n1290\n01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:28,560\nMm-hm.\n\n1291\n01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:31,910\nAll right.\nThe last couple of entries for\n\n1292\n01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:34,200\nthis objective are not so\nmuch about authentication but\n\n1293\n01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,730\njust about concepts that\nkind of tie into it.\n\n1294\n01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:38,260\nSo we need to be aware of that.\n\n1295\n01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:40,670\nSingle sign-on is a big part.\n\n1296\n01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:43,970\nIf you work in a enterprise environment,\n\n1297\n01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:47,630\nsingle sign-on will cross your,\nyour to-do list at some point.\n\n1298\n01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:48,320\nOkay?\n\n1299\n01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,050\nIf you've got a main frame.\n\n1300\n01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:55,250\nIf you've got Windows systems and Linux\nsystems and Mac OS, you've got web pages\n\n1301\n01:04:55,250 --> 01:05:00,302\nyou log into and so on, your end\nusers will have many user accounts.\n\n1302\n01:05:00,302 --> 01:05:01,860\nAll right.\n\n1303\n01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:04,550\nMy father worked for the V.A.\nsystem here in the U.S.\n\n1304\n01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:06,975\nThe Veteran's Affair Administration.\n\n1305\n01:05:06,975 --> 01:05:11,420\nAnd he basically was telling me about how,\nhow his login experience was.\n\n1306\n01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:15,970\nNow, he, he made false teeth, dentures,\ncrowns, bridges, that kind of stuff.\n\n1307\n01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:17,700\nSo, he wasn't an IT guy.\n\n1308\n01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:18,680\nHe wasn't in security.\n\n1309\n01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:23,320\nHe was just a, a normal employee\nnot in the technical sector.\n\n1310\n01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,440\nAnd he had four different\nuser accounts and passwords.\n\n1311\n01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,680\nHe had one for\nthe benefits system, one for\n\n1312\n01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,660\nthe email system, a different one for\nthe machine that was at his desk, and\n\n1313\n01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:36,970\na fourth one that was for,\noh something I can't remember what it was.\n\n1314\n01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:38,550\nThere were definitely four though.\n\n1315\n01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:41,450\nSo he had four different usernames and\npasswords he had to keep track of and so\n\n1316\n01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:42,690\nwhat did he do?\n\n1317\n01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:45,290\nHe wrote them on a little notepad\nthat he kept in his pocket.\n\n1318\n01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:46,430\nSo his usernames and\n\n1319\n01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:48,980\npasswords were all written down\nbecause he had too many to manage.\n\n1320\n01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:49,630\nIt's a challenge.\n\n1321\n01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:51,380\nRight?\nA lot of companies deal with this.\n\n1322\n01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:56,320\nSo organization will seek out\nways to do single sign on.\n\n1323\n01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:01,150\nThat's where you can use one username and\npassword on many different systems,\n\n1324\n01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:01,960\ndistributed systems.\n\n1325\n01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,270\nSystems that aren't identical.\n\n1326\n01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:04,000\nRight?\n\n1327\n01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,140\nAnd the nice thing there is,\nif you get it set up,\n\n1328\n01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:10,080\nif you wanna change your password you just\nchange your password in one place, and\n\n1329\n01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,420\nit's now changed across the whole board.\n\n1330\n01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:16,190\nWhen we talked about things like\nRadius that can help with that but\n\n1331\n01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:18,210\nnot everything is Radius compatible.\n\n1332\n01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:20,760\nAnd you might have different directories\nthat have different requirements, and\n\n1333\n01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,090\nmain frames are notorious for this.\n\n1334\n01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:26,800\nJust being so different that we\nmight not be able to create that.\n\n1335\n01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:30,810\nSo, there are many different technologies\nout there that have aimed to kind of solve\n\n1336\n01:06:30,810 --> 01:06:33,680\nthis solution, to provide single sign on.\n\n1337\n01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:39,520\nOne of them, if we look down a bit\nsomewhere here in our objectives.\n\n1338\n01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,380\nHere we go.\nWay down here.\n\n1339\n01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:41,450\nFederations.\n\n1340\n01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:42,180\nAll right?\n\n1341\n01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:46,180\nMicrosoft has been really pushing\nthe ideas of federations.\n\n1342\n01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:48,710\nA federation is where you have\ntwo separate organizations,\n\n1343\n01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:53,200\ntwo separate systems, but\nthey allow cross authentication.\n\n1344\n01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,680\nSo if you authenticate against system A,\nwhen you go to system B,\n\n1345\n01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,080\nit will see your\nauthentication credentials and\n\n1346\n01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:02,880\nsay yeah, all right, I trust you, I'll let\nyou in, I'll let you work on my system.\n\n1347\n01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:03,590\nRight.\n\n1348\n01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:05,470\nOr vice versa,\nit could be the other way around.\n\n1349\n01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:07,230\nThose are federations, when we tie these,\n\n1350\n01:07:07,230 --> 01:07:09,690\nwhat would normally be separate systems,\ntogether.\n\n1351\n01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:10,300\nAll right?\n\n1352\n01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:13,520\nNow, Microsoft does it through their\nactive directory federation services,\n\n1353\n01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,120\nbut they're not the only one, and in fact,\nthey're not the most popular ones.\n\n1354\n01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:19,490\nOne of the most popular\nones is called Shibboleth.\n\n1355\n01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:21,100\nLet me see if I can find that real quick.\n\n1356\n01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:26,110\nThe hardest part about shibboleth\nis remembering how to spell it\n\n1357\n01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:27,814\nwhich I completely spelled wrong.\n\n1358\n01:07:27,814 --> 01:07:28,920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Shibboleth, there we go.\n\n1359\n01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,150\nAll right.\n\n1360\n01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:34,700\nThese guys, it's an open source solution,\nand what they did is they created\n\n1361\n01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:39,570\na centralized framework that could\nexchange security credentials.\n\n1362\n01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:42,640\nAnd all they did was create\nthat central framework.\n\n1363\n01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,560\nAnd then everyone else, all the other\nvendors that are out there, so\n\n1364\n01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,810\nlike, Microsoft.\n\n1365\n01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:52,090\nMicrosoft set up their active directory\nfederation services to use standard SAML.\n\n1366\n01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:55,820\nRemember we, we mentioned the, the mark up\nlanguage we can use for single sign on?\n\n1367\n01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:58,240\nWell, they support SAML 2.0.\n\n1368\n01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,385\nShibboleth is designed\nto work with SAM-L 2.0.\n\n1369\n01:08:01,385 --> 01:08:05,445\nSo, active directory federation\ncan tie into Shibboleth.\n\n1370\n01:08:05,445 --> 01:08:09,745\nWell, IBM, with their Z-series mainframes,\nthey made it,\n\n1371\n01:08:09,745 --> 01:08:11,345\nwhere it could communicate\nwith Shibboleth.\n\n1372\n01:08:11,345 --> 01:08:13,855\nThere's these modules you buy\nthat allow it to attach to it.\n\n1373\n01:08:13,855 --> 01:08:17,660\nSo, all of the sudden, you have where you\ncan use your active directory user account\n\n1374\n01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:19,920\non an IBM Z series main frame.\n\n1375\n01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:20,500\nRight?\n\n1376\n01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:25,680\nAnd Apple's Open Directory and\nNovel's E Directory and Open LDAP.\n\n1377\n01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:29,230\nThey all have modules that allow\nthem to interface with Shibboleth.\n\n1378\n01:08:29,230 --> 01:08:31,940\nSo this can become that\ncentral gatekeeper to allow\n\n1379\n01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:34,290\ncredentials to pass between\nthe different systems.\n\n1380\n01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:38,910\nSo users can have one account that allows\naccess to all these different systems.\n\n1381\n01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:42,090\nAnd that makes your end\nuser's life a lot easier.\n\n1382\n01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:45,370\nNow they can pick one complex\npassword to remember and\n\n1383\n01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:49,010\nnot have to write stuff down on\nnotepads or post it notes or whatever.\n\n1384\n01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:51,330\nSo this is really a great solution.\n\n1385\n01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:54,850\nThese guys, it's open source,\nbut it's very complex software.\n\n1386\n01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:57,590\nYou know, it does take a,\na good bit of work to get it set up, and\n\n1387\n01:08:57,590 --> 01:09:01,390\nusually some development work because\nyou have these unique systems.\n\n1388\n01:09:01,390 --> 01:09:03,560\nBut once it's in place\nit's very rock solid.\n\n1389\n01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:06,660\nThe University of Florida here in town,\nthey use this.\n\n1390\n01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:10,675\nThey use it for their, you know,\nthey've got over 80,000 student accounts.\n\n1391\n01:09:10,675 --> 01:09:13,210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then something like 15,000\n\n1392\n01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:14,660\nemployee accounts.\n\n1393\n01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:17,550\nAnd so they're using it in\nthat environment to tie their\n\n1394\n01:09:17,550 --> 01:09:20,950\nactive directory together\nwith their PeopleSoft and\n\n1395\n01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:25,740\ntheir I forget what name frame they\nhave but you know, a name frame system.\n\n1396\n01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:29,330\nSo they, they interface all that together,\nit's really impressive.\n\n1397\n01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:30,470\nAll right?\n\n1398\n01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:32,140\nSo, there's other ones that are out there.\n\n1399\n01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:36,550\nMicrosoft, Active Directory Federation\nServices actually replaced an old product\n\n1400\n01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:40,539\nthey had, which was the Microsoft\nIdentity Integration Server, MIIS.\n\n1401\n01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:45,850\nSun Microsystems had one that was called,\nwhat was theirs called?\n\n1402\n01:09:45,850 --> 01:09:46,570\nTarantella?\n\n1403\n01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,296\nSomething like that.\n\n1404\n01:09:50,296 --> 01:09:52,185\nWhich it's gonna turn up dances.\n\n1405\n01:09:52,185 --> 01:09:54,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Which is what the word means but yeah,\n\n1406\n01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:57,140\nthere's an identity server called Taran.\n\n1407\n01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:00,360\nWell.\n\n1408\n01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:00,880\nWhatever.\n\n1409\n01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,150\nSo anyway, there are a number of\ndifferent products out there that will,\n\n1410\n01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:03,960\nthat will do it.\n\n1411\n01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,290\nBut Shibboleth is probably\none of the most common.\n\n1412\n01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:07,020\nHm, all right.\n\n1413\n01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:09,630\nAll right.\n\n1414\n01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:11,300\nLet's see,\nwhat else do we have on this one.\n\n1415\n01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,720\nWe've got access control\nwe've already talked about.\n\n1416\n01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:15,840\nRight?\nWhen somebody authenticates now we know\n\n1417\n01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:16,570\nwho they are.\n\n1418\n01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:20,990\nAnd we can apply axis controls to limit or\nallow their access.\n\n1419\n01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:22,760\nImplicit Deny.\n\n1420\n01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:26,530\nAlmost every system these\ndays has implicit deny.\n\n1421\n01:10:26,530 --> 01:10:32,010\nAnd what that means is when you have an\naccess list and it lists who has access,\n\n1422\n01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:36,540\nanybody who's not on the list,\nlet's just assumed that they're denied.\n\n1423\n01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:40,570\nThat they don't have access, either\nyou're on the list or you don't get in.\n\n1424\n01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,100\nAll right?\n\n1425\n01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:44,300\nThat's important because we don't want\npeople to have access that we don't know\n\n1426\n01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:46,880\nabout, and implicit denies what does that.\n\n1427\n01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:51,770\nThat's how UNIX based operating systems\nwork, that's how Microsoft Windows works,\n\n1428\n01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:53,810\nit's how Cisco firewalls and routers work.\n\n1429\n01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:57,710\nSo that's how most systems\nwork with that implicit deny.\n\n1430\n01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:00,160\nIf you look down the list,\nand you don't find a match.\n\n1431\n01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:04,020\nIf you're not on that list,\nthen the default action is to deny.\n\n1432\n01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:05,480\n>> Mm.\nYou know Don, and so\n\n1433\n01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:10,730\nthe opposite of a the implicit\ndeny is the Explicit Deny.\n\n1434\n01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:12,630\nSo, you are on the list.\n\n1435\n01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:15,620\nAnd you're on a list with\nyour access as denied.\n\n1436\n01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:16,320\nStraight up.\n\n1437\n01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:19,180\nSo, you're on there,\nyou're denied and, explicit deny,\n\n1438\n01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:21,980\nyou're just not on the list and\ncan't get in at all.\n\n1439\n01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:25,980\n>> Yeah and you know, a lot of times\nwe don't need to use the explicit deny.\n\n1440\n01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:28,610\nUnless you've got one of those scenarios\nwhere you have a user who's in more\n\n1441\n01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:30,010\nthan one group.\n\n1442\n01:11:30,010 --> 01:11:33,160\nAnd in one group they get access and\nin one group they don't.\n\n1443\n01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:36,510\nWell, you might want to make sure they\ndon't, and you use that explicit deny.\n\n1444\n01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:38,110\nSo yeah, that's another approach to that.\n\n1445\n01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:42,210\n>> So what about the trusted OS, Don?\n\n1446\n01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:45,420\nSo how is a trusted OS\nunder the authentication?\n\n1447\n01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:48,880\nBecause you know how we've hashed out\nTrusted OS before, and where they,\n\n1448\n01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,780\nwhere they kind of fit in their\nold trusted computing base and\n\n1449\n01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:52,840\nall that kind of stuff, but.\n\n1450\n01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,140\n>> I was I was joking around\nabout it during the, the break.\n\n1451\n01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,140\nYou know, we've already covered it.\n\n1452\n01:11:56,140 --> 01:11:57,370\nWhy throw it in here?\n\n1453\n01:11:57,370 --> 01:12:00,584\nThe reason it's in here is that a trusted\nOS has to authenticate two different\n\n1454\n01:12:00,584 --> 01:12:01,150\nthings.\n\n1455\n01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:04,615\nIt has to authenticate the users that\nare accessing the system as well\n\n1456\n01:12:04,615 --> 01:12:07,541\nas the applications and\ndrivers, you know the software,\n\n1457\n01:12:07,541 --> 01:12:10,725\nto make sure that it's trusted\nthat it's allowed to execute.\n\n1458\n01:12:10,725 --> 01:12:14,516\nSo it's constantly authenticating\nthese various mechanisms, users and\n\n1459\n01:12:14,516 --> 01:12:16,446\nsoftware to make sure they function.\n\n1460\n01:12:16,446 --> 01:12:20,434\nAnd then once they do function\nit's handling the authorization.\n\n1461\n01:12:20,434 --> 01:12:23,110\nMaking sure you're not accessing\nthings you're not authorized to do.\n\n1462\n01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:26,970\nYou know a lot of software\nthese days get sandboxed.\n\n1463\n01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:29,370\nSo like when you run Google Chrome,\n\n1464\n01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:32,560\neach tab in Google Chrome is\nsandboxed from the other ones.\n\n1465\n01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:36,310\nSo if one tab crashes it doesn't\ntake all of Chrome down,\n\n1466\n01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:38,500\nit just takes that tab down.\n\n1467\n01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:41,890\nAnd so that's where that trusted OS is\ngetting involved in making sure that\n\n1468\n01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:45,180\none tab doesn't have access to the others,\nright.\n\n1469\n01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:47,290\nSo that's why they throw it\nhere under authentication.\n\n1470\n01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:50,475\nIt does kind of stand out\nthough as a weird one.\n\n1471\n01:12:50,475 --> 01:12:51,274\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1472\n01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:56,440\nAll right, now when we talk about\ndual factor authentication or\n\n1473\n01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:59,830\nmulti factor because you might have\nmore than two, you can do that right.\n\n1474\n01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:04,830\nWe're talking about having to provide\nmore than form of authentication.\n\n1475\n01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:07,210\nAnd they need to be of different types.\n\n1476\n01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:10,450\nAnd historically there have been\nthree main types that we talk about.\n\n1477\n01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:14,080\nThe something you are,\nsomething you have, something you know.\n\n1478\n01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:16,200\nBut it's a little hard to tell\nfrom the objective list here,\n\n1479\n01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,980\nbut COMPTIA has added two more-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1480\n01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:19,140\n>> To the objectives that we need to know\n\n1481\n01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:20,870\nfor the exam and it's on the next page.\n\n1482\n01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:23,760\nSo something you are,\nsomething you have, something you know.\n\n1483\n01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,680\nSomewhere you are, and something you do.\n\n1484\n01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:27,940\nAll right?\n\n1485\n01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:32,860\nThese are five different\nthings that kind of dictate\n\n1486\n01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:35,270\na way to determine you\nare who you say you are.\n\n1487\n01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:36,570\nAll right?\n\n1488\n01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:40,330\nSo when we talk about something you are.\n\n1489\n01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:43,090\nSomething you are,\nthat's biometrics, right?\n\n1490\n01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:45,390\nBiometrics are your person.\n\n1491\n01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:48,610\nWe're talking about a fingerprint,\nright, a thumb print,\n\n1492\n01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:52,880\na palm print, retinal scan,\nwhat else could we have?\n\n1493\n01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:53,820\nVoice prints.\n\n1494\n01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:54,820\n>> Yeah, mm-hm.\n\n1495\n01:13:54,820 --> 01:13:56,420\nHand geometry and crazy ones.\n\n1496\n01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:57,840\n>> Oh, yeah.\nSome of those.\n\n1497\n01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,160\nAnd there's all sorts of crazy ones.\n\n1498\n01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,820\nBiometrics are very important.\n\n1499\n01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,400\nWhat they're measuring is who you are.\n\n1500\n01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,680\nAre you who you say you are, all right?\n\n1501\n01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:07,460\nI said this morning, I walked into\nthe office and I saw Nate And\n\n1502\n01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:09,050\nI knew it was him, I looked,\n\n1503\n01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:13,632\nI recognized what Nate looks like,\nI did a something you are, I saw Nate.\n\n1504\n01:14:13,632 --> 01:14:15,602\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I said there's that awkward smile.\n\n1505\n01:14:15,602 --> 01:14:16,915\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's him!\n\n1506\n01:14:16,915 --> 01:14:19,301\n[CROSSTALK] So-\n>> I kinda paused,\n\n1507\n01:14:19,301 --> 01:14:21,032\nI think I knew what you were about to say.\n\n1508\n01:14:21,032 --> 01:14:23,118\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] Well,\nyou know, it's a family show.\n\n1509\n01:14:23,118 --> 01:14:25,730\nSo anyhow.\n\n1510\n01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:27,820\nSo that's something you are, all right.\n\n1511\n01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:30,570\nNow a lot of people don't use\nbiometrics in their systems, right.\n\n1512\n01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:35,630\nWe don't use them here at ITProTV,\nso we need to use something else.\n\n1513\n01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:40,010\nAnd that's where something you\nknow comes in very common.\n\n1514\n01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:43,230\nSomething you know would be like\nusername and password, right.\n\n1515\n01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:46,220\nI know my password, or\nif there's security questions.\n\n1516\n01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:48,720\nWhat's your mother's maiden name,\nwhat was your first pet's name,\n\n1517\n01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:52,090\nwhat high school did you graduate from,\nthose are something you know,\n\n1518\n01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:56,270\nsomething that's in your head that\nnot just everybody else would know.\n\n1519\n01:14:56,270 --> 01:14:57,390\nRight.\n\n1520\n01:14:57,390 --> 01:14:59,990\nSomething you have is\nthe third most common.\n\n1521\n01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:04,370\nSomething you have would be like\nthose secure id tokens, right.\n\n1522\n01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:07,440\nI've got to have the token\nto read the code off of it.\n\n1523\n01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,720\nOr I might have my access, do I have,\nI don't have my keys on me.\n\n1524\n01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,445\nMy my access key fob to open up,\noh, you got yours.\n\n1525\n01:15:13,445 --> 01:15:15,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay. Here we go. I'll steal yours.\n\n1526\n01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:16,197\nSo, you just got socially engineered,\ndude.\n\n1527\n01:15:16,197 --> 01:15:18,620\n>> [LAUGH] [SOUND]\n>> Oh, see, that was a pretty good one.\n\n1528\n01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:19,960\nWe're gonna play that back later.\n\n1529\n01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,770\nI don't have my key fob.\n\n1530\n01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:22,452\nOh here, take mine.\n\n1531\n01:15:22,452 --> 01:15:25,930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, that's all it took.\n\n1532\n01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:30,380\nSo this is an RFID tag that we\nuse to get into the building.\n\n1533\n01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:32,960\nThis one's Nate's and so\nhe just goes up and taps it to the door.\n\n1534\n01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,150\nThis is the something he has.\n\n1535\n01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:38,890\nNow to get into the building,\nthat's a single factor authentication,\n\n1536\n01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:40,340\nhe just has to have that key fob.\n\n1537\n01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:44,220\nIf I punch Nate in the face,\ntook his token and ran, right,\n\n1538\n01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:47,540\nI could now get into the building, and\nin the logs it would show as being him.\n\n1539\n01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:52,580\nI provided all the information\nneeded to say that I was him, right.\n\n1540\n01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:54,820\nSo, those are the three most common.\n\n1541\n01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:57,680\nBut these other two, are kind of new.\n\n1542\n01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:58,300\nRight?\n\n1543\n01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:01,340\nSomewhere you are, this is important,\n\n1544\n01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:05,730\nokay, we use somewhere you\nare on the IT Pro TV site.\n\n1545\n01:16:05,730 --> 01:16:09,370\nIf I log in to IT Pro TV as\nan administrator to that website,\n\n1546\n01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:13,160\nall right, it knows I'm an admin and\nit looks at my IP address, and\n\n1547\n01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:17,130\nit says, has Don logged in from this\nIP address before, if so, great.\n\n1548\n01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:21,920\nAll right, But if not,\nif it's a log in from a new IP address,\n\n1549\n01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:26,280\nit shoots me an email and it says hey, a\nlog in is happening from this IP address.\n\n1550\n01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:27,580\nDo you want to allow it?\n\n1551\n01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,530\nAnd I can click the button and\nsay yeah, allow, that's me.\n\n1552\n01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:31,040\nRight.\nOr I can say ooh,\n\n1553\n01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,640\nI don't recognize that IP address.\n\n1554\n01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,110\nSomebody's trying to log in as me.\n\n1555\n01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:35,160\nI'm not gonna allow it.\n\n1556\n01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:38,000\nRight.\nThat's the somewhere you are and\n\n1557\n01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,530\nit's normally done by IP address\ncuz that's the easiest way.\n\n1558\n01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:42,900\nYou guys have probably seen\nthat with other systems.\n\n1559\n01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:43,650\nEven like Steam,\n\n1560\n01:16:43,650 --> 01:16:45,590\nif you have Steam Guard turned on,\n>> Hm, mm-hm.\n\n1561\n01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:48,070\n>> Every time you log in\nfrom a new IP address,\n\n1562\n01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:50,910\nit makes you do that\nauthentication code again.\n\n1563\n01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:53,950\nSo Somewhere you are is\na pretty easy one to test.\n\n1564\n01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:55,940\nBecause you can't forget it at home.\n\n1565\n01:16:55,940 --> 01:16:57,620\nI can forget my key fob at home.\n\n1566\n01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:59,790\nBut my somewhere you are,\nI'm there, right?\n\n1567\n01:16:59,790 --> 01:17:00,560\nYou can't forget that.\n\n1568\n01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,110\nAll right.\nAnd then there's the something you do.\n\n1569\n01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:08,490\nNow hey you do something you\ndo on your laptop, right?\n\n1570\n01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:11,480\n>> Yeah.\nSomething you do, right?\n\n1571\n01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,450\nLike picture passwords, right?\n\n1572\n01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:17,640\nPicture your passwords with Windows\n8 where you get these gestures and\n\n1573\n01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:23,210\nbased on the direction and the size of\nthese gestures, it will authenticate you.\n\n1574\n01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:24,820\nAnd you can log in to your laptop.\n\n1575\n01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:30,260\nNow another way of looking at something\nyou do is how you do something.\n\n1576\n01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:31,788\nNow let's say like entering in a password,\n\n1577\n01:17:31,788 --> 01:17:32,480\nright, so-\n>> Mm-Hm.\n\n1578\n01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:35,620\n>> Right, so you can type in your password\nand everything works out pretty great.\n\n1579\n01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:40,990\nBut the the timing of the spaces between\nthe keys depending on he system,\n\n1580\n01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:44,440\nit can read that as spacing, and\nso it's, not only are you putting\n\n1581\n01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:48,120\nin that specific password, but\nit's how quickly your type it in, or\n\n1582\n01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:53,110\nyou type in words at a time,\nvery very quickly or\n\n1583\n01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:59,130\nvery slowly, and that can also play into\nsomething you do or how you do something.\n\n1584\n01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:03,800\n>> Or, if I was getting a phone call\nfrom somebody who said they were Nate.\n\n1585\n01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,190\nAnd I asked them and I said,\n\n1586\n01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:08,325\nhey Nate, what's that thing that\ngoes around the edge of a monitor.\n\n1587\n01:18:08,325 --> 01:18:10,020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And if they said, bezel,\n\n1588\n01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:11,580\ni would know that it wasn't you.\n\n1589\n01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:14,360\nBut if they said beezel I'd be like\noh hey, it's Nate, all right [LAUGH].\n\n1590\n01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:19,420\nSo, people have characteristics,\nright, things that identify them.\n\n1591\n01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:24,620\nYou guys know it's me, well like,\nmaybe you're at the store and\n\n1592\n01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:28,010\nyou see somebody that looks like me,\nthat looks like Don, right.\n\n1593\n01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:29,360\nAnd you think hey is that Don?\n\n1594\n01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,320\nLet's go see if we can talk to him, right?\n\n1595\n01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,850\nBut as you get closer you\nrealize wait a minute.\n\n1596\n01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:35,160\nHe's not wearing the goofy vest.\n\n1597\n01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,220\nDon always wears vests.\n\n1598\n01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:37,500\nRight?\nSo that's not him.\n\n1599\n01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,680\nSo that's something I do.\n\n1600\n01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,150\nRight?\nWays we can identify people.\n\n1601\n01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:42,700\nAll sorts of different things there.\n\n1602\n01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:44,100\nThose five things.\n\n1603\n01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:47,190\nWe have to be a little careful because\nif you read a lot of security books that\n\n1604\n01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:50,700\nare out there all of them have the\nsomething you have, something you know,\n\n1605\n01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:51,470\nsomething you are.\n\n1606\n01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:53,780\nThose have been around for\na long time very common.\n\n1607\n01:18:53,780 --> 01:19:01,750\nBut on the exam you'll also see somewhere\nyou are and something you do, all right.\n\n1608\n01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:03,500\nWe got a few more things to talk about.\n\n1609\n01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:06,673\nActually let's wrap up these last,\nwe just have a couple of little points\n\n1610\n01:19:06,673 --> 01:19:09,843\nhere to hit on this subjective and\nwe'll do 5.3 in the last segment, so\n\n1611\n01:19:09,843 --> 01:19:12,680\nidentification we've already\ntalked about all these, right?\n\n1612\n01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:13,910\nBiometrics.\n\n1613\n01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:16,760\nFinger print, thumb print,\npalm print, hand geometry.\n\n1614\n01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:17,820\nAll that good stuff.\n\n1615\n01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:20,670\nWays that we measure a person's\nbody to ensure that they are who\n\n1616\n01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:21,520\nthey say they are.\n\n1617\n01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,060\nSome are more accurate than others.\n\n1618\n01:19:23,060 --> 01:19:23,610\nRight?\n\n1619\n01:19:23,610 --> 01:19:26,480\nThe retinal scan is\nsupposedly the most accurate.\n\n1620\n01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:32,190\nThe finger print is accurate enough, but\nthings like palm geometry can be be fooled\n\n1621\n01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:36,170\na little bit more easily, so we do have\nto be careful with which ones we choose.\n\n1622\n01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:40,000\nPersonal identification verification\ncards right, ID badges.\n\n1623\n01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,580\nThose types of things,\nthey can be falsified, right.\n\n1624\n01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:46,055\nBut used in combination with other forms\nof authentication can be very useful.\n\n1625\n01:19:46,055 --> 01:19:47,050\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1626\n01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:50,290\n>> And then the good old\nfashioned user name, right.\n\n1627\n01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:52,660\nUser name, it's been around forever.\n\n1628\n01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:56,720\nIt's usually public, people know what it\nis so it's not a form of authentication.\n\n1629\n01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:59,300\nWe don't want to authenticate\nsomebody off their username, but\n\n1630\n01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:02,760\nthey need to identify themselves and\nthat's one way to go about it.\n\n1631\n01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:03,710\nAll right.\n\n1632\n01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:05,217\nFederations I already talked about and\n\n1633\n01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:07,236\nthat's where we have two\nseparate organizations.\n\n1634\n01:20:07,236 --> 01:20:12,263\nLike two active directory forests or one\nactive directory forests and one realm or\n\n1635\n01:20:12,263 --> 01:20:16,446\nOr something like that, and we tie them\ntogether so they trust each other.\n\n1636\n01:20:16,446 --> 01:20:19,586\nSo they exchange information or\nauthentication credentials between them.\n\n1637\n01:20:19,586 --> 01:20:22,192\nThat's a federation.\n\n1638\n01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:27,585\nNow, federation's really common\nwhen you've got a local network and\n\n1639\n01:20:27,585 --> 01:20:33,092\ncloud service like Amazon EC2, or\nMicrosoft Azure, or Rackspace,\n\n1640\n01:20:33,092 --> 01:20:36,205\nor whatever where you have those service\nthat are out there and you wanna be able\n\n1641\n01:20:36,205 --> 01:20:39,780\nto share credentials between them, you'll\nsee things like federations gets set up.\n\n1642\n01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:44,370\nThe thing we have to be careful\nwith federations is we can have\n\n1643\n01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:47,060\ntransitive trusts if we're not careful.\n\n1644\n01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:49,730\nAnd let me just kinda draw a picture\nto show you what I mean by\n\n1645\n01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:50,870\na transitive trust.\n\n1646\n01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:58,024\nWhen we have our own organization,\nso I might have my company.\n\n1647\n01:20:58,024 --> 01:20:59,295\nHere, I'll just do a circle.\n\n1648\n01:20:59,295 --> 01:21:03,894\nSo here's my company,\nand maybe I go out and\n\n1649\n01:21:03,894 --> 01:21:09,736\nI decide I'm going to set up\nservices in Windows Azure,\n\n1650\n01:21:09,736 --> 01:21:12,487\nso on the Microsoft side.\n\n1651\n01:21:12,487 --> 01:21:14,158\nSo here's Don Co.\n\n1652\n01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:15,795\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n1653\n01:21:15,795 --> 01:21:19,377\nI guess I could have written\nthat somewhat bigger.\n\n1654\n01:21:19,377 --> 01:21:20,810\nThere.\n\n1655\n01:21:20,810 --> 01:21:22,170\nHere's Don Co.\n\n1656\n01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:25,520\nAnd then I set up some stuff in Azure.\n\n1657\n01:21:26,910 --> 01:21:32,627\nAnd so I set up a trust between these two\nso that my accounts can be used that way.\n\n1658\n01:21:32,627 --> 01:21:36,943\nNow, normally we would do these one way,\nbut for the sake of this argument,\n\n1659\n01:21:36,943 --> 01:21:38,027\nwe'll go two way.\n\n1660\n01:21:38,027 --> 01:21:41,725\nAnd I say one way like I want my\nDon Co accounts to work in Azure, but\n\n1661\n01:21:41,725 --> 01:21:45,036\nI probably don't want my Azure\naccounts to work in Don Co.\n\n1662\n01:21:45,036 --> 01:21:48,678\nAnd the reason is that Azure accounts\nare public, it's exposed to the Internet.\n\n1663\n01:21:48,678 --> 01:21:52,260\nThe odds of them getting\nhacked is much higher.\n\n1664\n01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:54,700\nAnd don't want somebody\nto break into Azure and\n\n1665\n01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:57,590\nthen through that,\nbreak into my local company.\n\n1666\n01:21:57,590 --> 01:21:58,400\nI don't want that.\n\n1667\n01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,420\nSo that's why these\nare normally one-way trust.\n\n1668\n01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:02,980\nBut I'll show you two-way just for\nthe sake of this example.\n\n1669\n01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:05,620\nSo if I have it set up like this, and\n\n1670\n01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:10,492\nthen maybe I start doing business with\nanother company, and that other company,\n\n1671\n01:22:10,492 --> 01:22:15,610\nlet's see.\n\n1672\n01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:18,640\nThat other company, maybe it's Nate Co.\n\n1673\n01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,390\nThis would be your company.\n\n1674\n01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:24,200\nAnd so I get out there and\nI start to set up this connection so\n\n1675\n01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:29,570\nthat we trust Nate's company too,\nand we get that set up as a trust.\n\n1676\n01:22:30,690 --> 01:22:35,210\nWell, when we start to unify this,\nthe Don Co accounts now work in Azure,\n\n1677\n01:22:35,210 --> 01:22:37,090\nthe Nate Co accounts work in Azure.\n\n1678\n01:22:37,090 --> 01:22:41,390\nBut if we set these up as two-way,\nnotice what can happen.\n\n1679\n01:22:41,390 --> 01:22:46,280\nIf Azure trusts Nate, and I trust Azure,\n\n1680\n01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:51,700\ntransitively though Azure,\nI now trust Nate, and vice versa.\n\n1681\n01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,010\nSo now, accounts over in Nate Co\ncould potentially come and\n\n1682\n01:22:56,010 --> 01:22:58,200\nlog into systems over here in Don Co.\n\n1683\n01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,460\nAnd that might not be what I want, and\n\n1684\n01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:02,830\nthat's why the direction of\nthese trusts is so important.\n\n1685\n01:23:03,950 --> 01:23:08,550\nWhen we go to establish them,\nif we set them up as one way like this,\n\n1686\n01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:12,090\nI have my accounts that will go and\nwork in Azure.\n\n1687\n01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:15,650\nSo my accounts work in Azure,\nNate's accounts work in Azure.\n\n1688\n01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:19,300\nNow, Nate has it set up two ways so\nthe Azure accounts work over here.\n\n1689\n01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,670\nBut Nate, if he jumps over to Azure,\n\n1690\n01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:27,450\ncan't in turn jump over to me because I\nset that trust up only one direction.\n\n1691\n01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:31,790\nWhen you have them set up both ways, you\nget this transitive trust where you trust\n\n1692\n01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:34,710\none person, they trust somebody else, and\n\n1693\n01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:39,250\nthrough that middle man,\nyou indirectly trust the remote person.\n\n1694\n01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:40,080\nYou may want that.\n\n1695\n01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:41,330\nThat may be exactly what you want.\n\n1696\n01:23:41,330 --> 01:23:43,340\nIf you have like an active\ndirectory forest,\n\n1697\n01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:45,330\nyou want that amongst your forest domains.\n\n1698\n01:23:45,330 --> 01:23:47,670\nYou want that two-way transitive trust.\n\n1699\n01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:51,420\nBut when you're talking about\na public service like this,\n\n1700\n01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:53,440\nyou do not want a transitive trust.\n\n1701\n01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:56,949\nSo you need to make sure that you\nconfigure that properly when you set up\n\n1702\n01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:59,089\nthat trust,\nthat it is only set up one way,\n\n1703\n01:23:59,089 --> 01:24:01,425\nthat federation works\nin a single direction.\n\n1704\n01:24:01,425 --> 01:24:02,952\nThat is important.\n\n1705\n01:24:02,952 --> 01:24:07,744\nNow, even we do it two directions,\nif you're doing this like with Microsoft,\n\n1706\n01:24:07,744 --> 01:24:12,880\nwith Microsoft you can set this up and you\ncan still tell it not to be transitive.\n\n1707\n01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,039\nSo yes, you trust Azure accounts, but\n\n1708\n01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:18,440\nyou won't trust the Nate Co\naccounts coming through it.\n\n1709\n01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:20,560\nSo some systems have that functionality.\n\n1710\n01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,500\nIt just depends on\nthe system you're using.\n\n1711\n01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:26,453\nSo make sure you pay attention,\nlike when you're using shibboleth or\n\n1712\n01:24:26,453 --> 01:24:30,920\nother solutions, that you are taking\nthe proper precautions there\n\n1713\n01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:33,350\nto ensure you don't accidentally\ntrust somebody else's accounts.\n\n1714\n01:24:36,570 --> 01:24:38,926\nSo that's basically what they're\ncalling out there for trust and\n\n1715\n01:24:38,926 --> 01:24:40,026\ntransitive authentication.\n\n1716\n01:24:40,026 --> 01:24:40,642\n>> Nice.\n\n1717\n01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:44,573\n>> Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is a\npretty good spot to stop and take a break.\n\n1718\n01:24:44,573 --> 01:24:47,410\nWhen we get back, we're gonna\ntalk about account management and\n\n1719\n01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:50,575\nways that we can help to improve\nsecurity amongst for our user accounts.\n\n1720\n01:24:50,575 --> 01:24:51,505\nIt's an important thing.\n\n1721\n01:24:51,505 --> 01:24:53,502\nBut we're out of time for this segment.\n\n1722\n01:24:53,502 --> 01:24:57,182\nSo we'll stop and take a break, and\nthen we'll pick right back up after this.\n\n1723\n01:24:57,182 --> 01:25:05,069\n[MUSIC]\n\n1724\n01:25:05,069 --> 01:25:05,760\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n1725\n01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:11,000\nSo for our final segment, we're gonna take\na look at managing account credentials.\n\n1726\n01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,765\nBecause it doesn't matter,\nif you go single factor authentication or\n\n1727\n01:25:14,765 --> 01:25:18,850\nmultifactor authentication, you're pretty\nmuch always gonna have that user name and\n\n1728\n01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:22,520\npassword at least until technology\nadvances beyond where it is now.\n\n1729\n01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,930\nSo how do we make sure\nthat those user names and\n\n1730\n01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:26,670\npasswords are as secure as possible?\n\n1731\n01:25:26,670 --> 01:25:28,095\nAnd there are a number of techniques.\n\n1732\n01:25:28,095 --> 01:25:32,518\nAnd in fact, in the objectives\nthey rattle off a list here,\n\n1733\n01:25:32,518 --> 01:25:36,766\nlike password complexity requirements,\nexpiration,\n\n1734\n01:25:36,766 --> 01:25:39,606\nrecovery, disablement, lockout.\n\n1735\n01:25:39,606 --> 01:25:41,698\nAll these different things for\n\n1736\n01:25:41,698 --> 01:25:48,090\ninsuring that our user accounts maintain\nsecure passwords and safe passwords.\n\n1737\n01:25:48,090 --> 01:25:49,940\nWell, what we need to do is,\n\n1738\n01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:53,340\nwe've kind of already talked about\na lot of these in previous shows, but\n\n1739\n01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:57,290\nwhat they want you to know here is\ninstall and configure security controls.\n\n1740\n01:25:57,290 --> 01:25:58,810\nThis is the first one\nwe've seen in a while.\n\n1741\n01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:03,340\nMost of these have all been described or\ndifferentiated or whatever, so\n\n1742\n01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:04,230\nknow the concept.\n\n1743\n01:26:04,230 --> 01:26:06,330\nHere, they want you to\nknow how to install them.\n\n1744\n01:26:06,330 --> 01:26:09,358\nSo we need to have a good understanding of\nhow to put something like this in place.\n\n1745\n01:26:09,358 --> 01:26:13,320\nNow, the Security+ exam\nis fairly vendor neutral,\n\n1746\n01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,620\nbut in this case,\nwhen they talk about install and\n\n1747\n01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:18,990\nconfigure, they're actually talking\nabout in a Windows environment.\n\n1748\n01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:20,780\nAnd that's because the Windows\nenvironments are the most\n\n1749\n01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:23,050\ncommon in the corporate environment.\n\n1750\n01:26:23,050 --> 01:26:26,360\nSo that when you see things like\ngroup policy, through policy,\n\n1751\n01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:27,750\nthat's a Microsoft thing.\n\n1752\n01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:29,770\nNow, you can do this\nstuff under other OSs.\n\n1753\n01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:34,580\nSo in Mac OS, you have the profile\nmanager, and you can actually go in, and\n\n1754\n01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:37,800\nset that up, and do the same exact\nthing we're about to do in Windows.\n\n1755\n01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,000\nSo it's not a Microsoft-only thing, but\n\n1756\n01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,220\nwhen you see it on the exam,\nit'll be in the Windows environment.\n\n1757\n01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:46,490\nSo let's take a look at\nhow we can enforce this\n\n1758\n01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:49,280\ntype of a safe environment\nin a Windows world.\n\n1759\n01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:53,370\nSo I'm gonna use one of our online V labs,\n\n1760\n01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:56,880\nthis is the Windows server V\nlab that we have on IT Pro TV,\n\n1761\n01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:01,430\nso if you ever wanna access this, and\nkinda do the same thing that I'm doing.\n\n1762\n01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:05,460\nSo if we go into our website,\nyou'll see up here we've got Resources and\n\n1763\n01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:07,280\nVirtual Labs.\n\n1764\n01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:10,230\nAnd in the Virtual Lab, you'll see some\nof the different virtual labs we have.\n\n1765\n01:27:10,230 --> 01:27:13,350\nI'm using this one right here,\nthe Microsoft Server 2012 vLab,\n\n1766\n01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:14,790\nthat guy right there.\n\n1767\n01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:17,130\nAnd you can fire it up,\nit'll give you a couple of servers and\n\n1768\n01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:18,820\nworkstations to mess with.\n\n1769\n01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:23,290\nSo that's what I'm\noperating in right here.\n\n1770\n01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:26,210\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take\nthis environment, I'm gonna secure it.\n\n1771\n01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:28,810\nNow, it's running the Windows\nactive directory.\n\n1772\n01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:31,900\nAnd in the active directory, you can\ncreate what's called a group policy.\n\n1773\n01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:36,550\nIt's a collection of settings that\nyou enforce upon the workstations and\n\n1774\n01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:38,140\nservers in your environment.\n\n1775\n01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:43,540\nThat means we can define one password\npolicy, and have it apply to everybody.\n\n1776\n01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:44,840\nAnd that's typically what we want.\n\n1777\n01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,310\nSo to do that, I'm just gonna go up\nhere to Tools > Group Policy Management.\n\n1778\n01:27:51,310 --> 01:27:52,420\nSo I'm gonna fire that up.\n\n1779\n01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,830\nTo get started, I'm in the Server Manager.\n\n1780\n01:27:56,830 --> 01:28:00,110\nWhen you boot up Windows Server 2012,\nthis comes up automatically.\n\n1781\n01:28:00,110 --> 01:28:01,215\nBut let's pretend for\n\n1782\n01:28:01,215 --> 01:28:05,125\na minute that I wasn't in there,\nthat I was actually starting from scratch.\n\n1783\n01:28:05,125 --> 01:28:06,648\nSo step one would be to\nlaunch the Server Manager.\n\n1784\n01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:09,167\nYou have a nice little button for\nthat right there in your Taskbar.\n\n1785\n01:28:09,167 --> 01:28:11,267\nSo that was kind of already done,\n\n1786\n01:28:11,267 --> 01:28:15,992\nbut let me start from there just to make\nsure everybody is on the same page And\n\n1787\n01:28:15,992 --> 01:28:20,426\nfrom here I'm going to Tools >\nGroup Policy Management, all right.\n\n1788\n01:28:20,426 --> 01:28:22,741\nNow, inside of Group Policy Management,\n\n1789\n01:28:22,741 --> 01:28:25,450\nwe'll see any of the group\npolicies that we have.\n\n1790\n01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:28,090\nAnd if haven't written any,\nyou'll only have two.\n\n1791\n01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:30,760\nYou'll have this Default Domain Policy,\nand\n\n1792\n01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:34,900\nyou'll have a Domain Controller,\nDefault Domain Controller Policy.\n\n1793\n01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:38,950\nIf we want to create one\npassword policy that applies to\n\n1794\n01:28:38,950 --> 01:28:41,620\nall of our users throughout\nthe entire company,\n\n1795\n01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:45,080\nthen typically we're going to\nuse this default domain policy.\n\n1796\n01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,690\nYou can just go in and modify it.\n\n1797\n01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:49,430\nThat policy applies to everyone,\nall right?\n\n1798\n01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:53,640\nIf you want to have separate password\npolicies for different people, well,\n\n1799\n01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:55,120\nthings get a little more complex.\n\n1800\n01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:59,153\nAnd that's where you have to do fine grain\npassword policies which Microsoft does\n\n1801\n01:28:59,153 --> 01:29:00,097\nhave support for.\n\n1802\n01:29:00,097 --> 01:29:02,671\nWe cover that in some of\nour Windows server shows,\n\n1803\n01:29:02,671 --> 01:29:07,105\nif you jump over to like the 70-4 or\nI think it's in the 4-11 show, isn't it?\n\n1804\n01:29:07,105 --> 01:29:07,662\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay.\n\n1805\n01:29:07,662 --> 01:29:10,358\nSo you can jump over and check it out\nthere if you wanna go complex, but\n\n1806\n01:29:10,358 --> 01:29:12,326\nyou're not gonna see them\non security plus exam.\n\n1807\n01:29:12,326 --> 01:29:13,640\nYou're gonna see the more general stuff.\n\n1808\n01:29:14,650 --> 01:29:19,059\nSo when we go in here, if we just\ntake that Default Domain Policy,\n\n1809\n01:29:19,059 --> 01:29:21,556\nI'm going to edit that, all right.\n\n1810\n01:29:21,556 --> 01:29:25,420\nAnd inside of here we'll start to see\nsome of the different settings available.\n\n1811\n01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:28,110\nAnd you'll see settings\nthat apply to computers and\n\n1812\n01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:30,660\nsetting that apply to users, all right.\n\n1813\n01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:34,351\nI'm concerned about the users,\nso if I go under Policies >\n\n1814\n01:29:34,351 --> 01:29:39,460\nWindows Settings,\nI can find Security Settings.\n\n1815\n01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:42,114\nAnd under Security Settings,\noh, you know what?\n\n1816\n01:29:42,114 --> 01:29:44,510\nActually I'm going to the wrong place,\naren't I?\n\n1817\n01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:47,600\nLet me just double check this real quick.\n\n1818\n01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,060\nI think I am going to the wrong spot.\n\n1819\n01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:50,500\nOh, I am, shoot.\n\n1820\n01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:52,649\nIt is actually under computer settings.\n\n1821\n01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:56,705\nI'm putting in a password policy,\nand that affects users.\n\n1822\n01:29:56,705 --> 01:29:58,127\nSo you think all right, well,\n\n1823\n01:29:58,127 --> 01:30:02,126\nI'm definitely going to go into the users\nsetting, but the users don't enforce their\n\n1824\n01:30:02,126 --> 01:30:05,120\nown password policy,\nyour domain controllers do, all right.\n\n1825\n01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:08,624\nSo it's actually a change that we\nhave to make to the computers, and\n\n1826\n01:30:08,624 --> 01:30:10,355\nthey then enforce it on the user.\n\n1827\n01:30:10,355 --> 01:30:11,860\nAnd that's why it's under\nthe computer settings.\n\n1828\n01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:17,193\nSo, I went to Users > Policies > Windows\nSettings, that's where I went first, and I\n\n1829\n01:30:17,193 --> 01:30:22,420\nshould have gone to Computer Configuration\n> Policies > Windows Settings.\n\n1830\n01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:24,880\nAnd under here I've got Security Settings,\nand\n\n1831\n01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,380\nthat's where I'll see Account Policies.\n\n1832\n01:30:26,380 --> 01:30:28,960\nThat's what I'm looking for\nright there, all right.\n\n1833\n01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:31,770\nSo under Account Policies I've\ngot the Password Policy.\n\n1834\n01:30:31,770 --> 01:30:34,920\nAnd here's where I can define\nrestrictions for my systems, and\n\n1835\n01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:37,455\nI think I brought this up in\na previous episode, didn't I?\n\n1836\n01:30:37,455 --> 01:30:39,890\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay, so if this seems like deja vu,\n\n1837\n01:30:39,890 --> 01:30:40,620\nit is, right.\n\n1838\n01:30:40,620 --> 01:30:42,854\nWe kind of brought this up,\nbut I want to do it again.\n\n1839\n01:30:42,854 --> 01:30:45,602\nBecause in that episode I brought\nit up just to show an example, but\n\n1840\n01:30:45,602 --> 01:30:48,309\nnow I want to make sure you guys\nactually understand the process.\n\n1841\n01:30:48,309 --> 01:30:50,430\nSo we're going to go through it again.\n\n1842\n01:30:50,430 --> 01:30:53,180\nHere we can see some settings, and\nlet's talk about each one of these and\n\n1843\n01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:54,910\nhow they improve security.\n\n1844\n01:30:54,910 --> 01:30:59,510\nThe first one is,\nenforce password history, all right?\n\n1845\n01:30:59,510 --> 01:31:01,280\nThe default is set to 24.\n\n1846\n01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:07,080\nAnd that means if I use a password today,\nand then I change my password tomorrow,\n\n1847\n01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:13,330\nI can't reuse the password I used today\nfor 24 more passwords, all right.\n\n1848\n01:31:13,330 --> 01:31:17,320\nSo I'll have to go through\n24 unique passwords\n\n1849\n01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:19,970\nbefore I can reuse the very first one.\n\n1850\n01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:20,772\nNow why would I want that?\n\n1851\n01:31:20,772 --> 01:31:25,370\nAll right, well a lot of us will\nset a maximum password age,\n\n1852\n01:31:25,370 --> 01:31:28,030\nthis second value here, and\nsee how it's set to 42 days?\n\n1853\n01:31:28,030 --> 01:31:29,290\nThat's like six weeks.\n\n1854\n01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:31,760\nLet's change that to 30.\n\n1855\n01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:34,300\nSo I'm gonna go to 30 days,\nbasically 1 month.\n\n1856\n01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:37,720\nSo every 30 days my users have to\nchange their password, all right?\n\n1857\n01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:38,370\nWell, what do they do?\n\n1858\n01:31:38,370 --> 01:31:42,013\nSo one month they set their password,\nand it's gators123.\n\n1859\n01:31:42,013 --> 01:31:43,007\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, and\n\n1860\n01:31:43,007 --> 01:31:45,601\nin here in Gainesville it's\na pretty common password.\n\n1861\n01:31:45,601 --> 01:31:49,670\nSo then, next month they have to change\ntheir password, and what do they do?\n\n1862\n01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:52,370\nThey make it gators321, all right?\n\n1863\n01:31:52,370 --> 01:31:54,990\nWell, then the next month,\nthey have to change it again.\n\n1864\n01:31:54,990 --> 01:31:57,329\nThey just go right back to gators123.\n\n1865\n01:31:57,329 --> 01:32:01,340\nAnd they just sit there and bounce between\ngators123 and gators321, and that's it.\n\n1866\n01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:02,240\nThat's their password.\n\n1867\n01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:05,840\nMonth after month, they're just\ncycling between those two passwords.\n\n1868\n01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:09,310\nThis setting,\nin force password history, stops that.\n\n1869\n01:32:09,310 --> 01:32:13,730\nIt says,\nyou've gotta go 24 different passwords\n\n1870\n01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:18,320\nbefore you can reuse that password\nthat you used initially, alright?\n\n1871\n01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:21,522\nThat's what enforce password history does.\n\n1872\n01:32:21,522 --> 01:32:25,390\n24 is a pretty big number so\nthat's usually big enough for people.\n\n1873\n01:32:25,390 --> 01:32:27,200\nYou might choose to go further or\nwhatever.\n\n1874\n01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,110\nIt's up to you.\n\n1875\n01:32:28,110 --> 01:32:30,750\nAll right, maximum password\nage I just explained, right?\n\n1876\n01:32:30,750 --> 01:32:33,530\nThey'll have to change their\npassword every 30 days.\n\n1877\n01:32:33,530 --> 01:32:37,420\nThey can change it earlier if they want,\nbut 30 days is the longest they can go\n\n1878\n01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:40,290\nwithout changing their password\nto something new, all right?\n\n1879\n01:32:40,290 --> 01:32:45,585\nAnd if we've got a 24 password history and\nwe're resetting it every 30 days,\n\n1880\n01:32:45,585 --> 01:32:48,795\nover the course of a year they should\nuse 12 different passwords, right.\n\n1881\n01:32:48,795 --> 01:32:50,905\nOne each month as they\ngo through the year, and\n\n1882\n01:32:50,905 --> 01:32:55,005\nit'll be two years before they're able to\nreuse one of their original passwords.\n\n1883\n01:32:55,005 --> 01:32:55,805\nThat's a pretty good policy.\n\n1884\n01:32:57,485 --> 01:33:01,620\nNow the next one is one that is confusing,\nminimum password age.\n\n1885\n01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:04,990\nSo when they change their password,\nthey won't be able to change it again,\n\n1886\n01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:07,890\nin this case,\nuntil it's been one day, all right?\n\n1887\n01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:11,130\nWhy would I wanna make somebody\nwait to change their password?\n\n1888\n01:33:11,130 --> 01:33:14,794\nWell, the answer, the short answer is that\nyour end-users are typically annoying.\n\n1889\n01:33:14,794 --> 01:33:15,840\n[LAUGH] And-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1890\n01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,760\n>> And they will find ways to\n\n1891\n01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:18,959\nthwart your plans.\n\n1892\n01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:23,953\nSo if you have password history of 24,\nall right, and\n\n1893\n01:33:23,953 --> 01:33:27,903\nthey have password they're used to and\nthey wanna keep it,\n\n1894\n01:33:27,903 --> 01:33:31,861\nthey could sit there and\nchange their password 24 times.\n\n1895\n01:33:31,861 --> 01:33:35,201\nAnd when they were done, they could go\nback to their original password, and\n\n1896\n01:33:35,201 --> 01:33:37,041\nnow they could keep using it, all right.\n\n1897\n01:33:37,041 --> 01:33:38,210\nWe don't want that.\n\n1898\n01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:40,660\nSo by setting a minimum age, saying, hey,\n\n1899\n01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:44,660\nyou just changed your password, you've now\ngot to wait 24 hours to change it again.\n\n1900\n01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:48,790\nNow, if they want to change their password\n24 times, it'll take them 24 days.\n\n1901\n01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,500\nSo that's a great way to stop that,\n\n1902\n01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:53,420\njust stop rapid password cycling,\na minimum password age.\n\n1903\n01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:57,510\nNow, the rest of these\nreally deal with complexity.\n\n1904\n01:33:57,510 --> 01:34:02,550\nMinimum password length, what's the fewest\ncharacters you can type for a password?\n\n1905\n01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:05,190\nIf you let your users,\nthey'll do one letter passwords.\n\n1906\n01:34:05,190 --> 01:34:06,700\nThey'll do blank passwords\nif you let them,\n\n1907\n01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:09,130\nright, because they don't\nunderstand security.\n\n1908\n01:34:09,130 --> 01:34:11,340\nAnd in a lot of cases,\nthey just haven't been trained for it.\n\n1909\n01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:13,200\nSo we need to enforce a minimum.\n\n1910\n01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:14,380\nThe default here is 7.\n\n1911\n01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:15,999\nI'm going to bump that up to 8.\n\n1912\n01:34:15,999 --> 01:34:18,101\n8 is a little more standard.\n\n1913\n01:34:18,101 --> 01:34:20,580\nBut you might even need to go\nstronger in your environment.\n\n1914\n01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:22,650\nYou may need to go to 10,\n12, 15, whatever.\n\n1915\n01:34:22,650 --> 01:34:26,020\nNow if you go beyond 15 characters,\nyou can break compatibility with\n\n1916\n01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:29,630\nolder Windows systems, but you shouldn't\nbe running those older systems anyway.\n\n1917\n01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:32,060\nSo, feel free to go beyond, right?\n\n1918\n01:34:32,060 --> 01:34:37,566\nBut if you still have NT 4 in your network\na 16 character password will mess it up.\n\n1919\n01:34:37,566 --> 01:34:42,340\nAll right, password must meet\ncomplexity requirements.\n\n1920\n01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:43,970\nThis is a real important one.\n\n1921\n01:34:43,970 --> 01:34:47,220\nIf this is turned off,\npeople can use dictionary words.\n\n1922\n01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:51,210\nThey can just use whatever word,\nthey could use the word dictionary, right.\n\n1923\n01:34:51,210 --> 01:34:53,010\nAnd that's their password, right?\n\n1924\n01:34:53,010 --> 01:34:55,055\nWell if you turn on password complexity,\n\n1925\n01:34:55,055 --> 01:34:59,060\nit's going to eliminate\nunsecure passwords.\n\n1926\n01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:03,540\nSo like password123 or\njust the word password, it'll stop those.\n\n1927\n01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:07,450\nIt will also make them have\nat least one capital letter,\n\n1928\n01:35:07,450 --> 01:35:11,820\nat least one lowercase letter,\nand at least one number, and\n\n1929\n01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:15,690\none special character like a punctuation\nmark of some sort, all right.\n\n1930\n01:35:15,690 --> 01:35:17,280\nThat's a complex password.\n\n1931\n01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:19,850\nWe want to ensure that\nthey meet that complexity.\n\n1932\n01:35:19,850 --> 01:35:24,200\nOtherwise, they're gonna pick dictionary\nwords that are really easy to guess.\n\n1933\n01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:29,210\nA brute force attack will be able to help,\nhit them pretty quickly, all right.\n\n1934\n01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:31,240\nAnd you can see here\nMicrosoft's explanation of what\n\n1935\n01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:33,000\nthey view as a complex password.\n\n1936\n01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,030\nThat can be very different\nthan your definition, though.\n\n1937\n01:35:35,030 --> 01:35:36,530\nAnd there are ways to modify this, but\n\n1938\n01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:38,632\nthat kinda goes beyond what\nyou'll see on the exam.\n\n1939\n01:35:38,632 --> 01:35:45,210\nAll right, the last one is store\npasswords using reversible encryption.\n\n1940\n01:35:45,210 --> 01:35:49,330\nBy default, Microsoft stores\nthe password as a one-way hash password.\n\n1941\n01:35:49,330 --> 01:35:52,810\nIn other words, there's no way for\nyou to reverse it and get their password.\n\n1942\n01:35:52,810 --> 01:35:55,891\nIf somebody forgets their password,\nthe only thing you can do is reset it for\n\n1943\n01:35:55,891 --> 01:35:56,574\nsomething new.\n\n1944\n01:35:56,574 --> 01:35:57,618\nYou can't figure out what\ntheir old password is.\n\n1945\n01:35:57,618 --> 01:36:00,948\nIf you turn this option on,\nthe password just stored is reversible, so\n\n1946\n01:36:00,948 --> 01:36:04,126\nyou can actually decrypt the passwords\nto figure out what they are.\n\n1947\n01:36:04,126 --> 01:36:06,176\nYou don't normally want that.\n\n1948\n01:36:06,176 --> 01:36:11,371\nSo those are some of the password\nsettings we can use.\n\n1949\n01:36:11,371 --> 01:36:15,190\nBut if we stop there, we're really\nmissing out on some important things.\n\n1950\n01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:19,750\nEven though we've got some nice little\ncomplexity requirements set up here,\n\n1951\n01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:22,390\nwe still are susceptible\nto brute force attacks.\n\n1952\n01:36:22,390 --> 01:36:25,050\nSomebody could try and\nbrute force a password to get in.\n\n1953\n01:36:25,050 --> 01:36:29,590\nSo we need to combine this with\nan account lockout policy.\n\n1954\n01:36:29,590 --> 01:36:33,700\nAn account lockout policy states,\nif somebody gets enough incorrect\n\n1955\n01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:38,120\npasswords in a short amount of time, then\nwe can lock them out, lock their account.\n\n1956\n01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:41,840\nAnd that way, somebody can't just sit\nthere and keep trying to guess passwords.\n\n1957\n01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:49,060\nSo I might wanna set an account lockout\nthreshold to five invalid attempts.\n\n1958\n01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:51,005\nAccount will lock out after\nfive invalid attempts.\n\n1959\n01:36:51,005 --> 01:36:54,273\nSo if somebody tries five times and\ngets it wrong, it's gonna lock them out.\n\n1960\n01:36:54,273 --> 01:36:57,913\nAnd I can see in the explanation there\nthat it's telling me about how many I can\n\n1961\n01:36:57,913 --> 01:36:59,705\nchoose, but I'm setting it to five.\n\n1962\n01:37:02,555 --> 01:37:05,027\nNow, it's gonna show me some\nother suggested changes.\n\n1963\n01:37:05,027 --> 01:37:08,815\nThese are my account lockout duration,\nand reset account lockout.\n\n1964\n01:37:09,895 --> 01:37:14,545\nAnd if I just hit OK on that, I can see\nhere's my account lockout duration, and\n\n1965\n01:37:14,545 --> 01:37:17,255\nreset account lockout counter after.\n\n1966\n01:37:17,255 --> 01:37:22,520\nWhen we say five invalid login attempts,\nwell, five within how much time?\n\n1967\n01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:23,990\nWithin an hour?\n\n1968\n01:37:23,990 --> 01:37:25,660\nWithin a day?\n\n1969\n01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:28,350\nHow rapid does it have to be\nto be a brute force attempt?\n\n1970\n01:37:28,350 --> 01:37:30,876\nWell, a brute force attempt is\ngonna fire them in rapid fire.\n\n1971\n01:37:30,876 --> 01:37:32,258\nThey're gonna come in quick.\n\n1972\n01:37:32,258 --> 01:37:34,878\nSo if we say 5 failures in 30 minutes,\nwell,\n\n1973\n01:37:34,878 --> 01:37:38,612\nyour average end user, yeah,\nthey might forget their password and\n\n1974\n01:37:38,612 --> 01:37:42,427\nmake a few mistakes, but\nthey probably won't do 5 in 30 minutes.\n\n1975\n01:37:42,427 --> 01:37:43,994\nMaybe, some of them will.\n\n1976\n01:37:43,994 --> 01:37:48,180\nSo 5 in 30 minutes, that's gonna\nbe enough to stop a brute force.\n\n1977\n01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:49,290\nWe can even bump this up.\n\n1978\n01:37:49,290 --> 01:37:51,910\nWe could say 10 in 30 minutes.\n\n1979\n01:37:51,910 --> 01:37:55,970\nIf they try 10 in 30 minutes,\nthen lock them out.\n\n1980\n01:37:55,970 --> 01:37:57,392\nYour average end user isn't gonna try ten.\n\n1981\n01:37:57,392 --> 01:38:00,106\nThey're gonna try and figure a few,\nand then they'll just give up and\n\n1982\n01:38:00,106 --> 01:38:00,660\nget it reset.\n\n1983\n01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:04,560\nNow, once they get locked out,\nwhat happens from there?\n\n1984\n01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,890\nWell, then you have your\naccount lockout duration.\n\n1985\n01:38:06,890 --> 01:38:10,590\nSo we come in here, and we specify how\nlong we're gonna keep them locked out for.\n\n1986\n01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:12,120\nThe default is 30 minutes.\n\n1987\n01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:14,100\nSo after 30 minutes,\nthey'll be able to try and\n\n1988\n01:38:14,100 --> 01:38:17,150\nlog in again without calling the help\ndesk, it'll just automatically unlock.\n\n1989\n01:38:18,270 --> 01:38:20,770\nOr, we might wanna set that to 0,\n\n1990\n01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:24,970\nwhich means they'll be locked out\nuntil an administrator unlocks it.\n\n1991\n01:38:24,970 --> 01:38:29,410\nWe'll lock them out forever until one of\nus gets in there and lets them back in.\n\n1992\n01:38:29,410 --> 01:38:32,830\nThat can be a little more ideal,\nexcept there is a risk here.\n\n1993\n01:38:33,870 --> 01:38:38,620\nI'm setting this on my domain, it's going\nto apply to everyone, my entire domain.\n\n1994\n01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:42,676\nSomebody could maliciously target me\nas an administrator, or whatever.\n\n1995\n01:38:42,676 --> 01:38:44,970\nThey can try to log in as me,\nnot trying to get in,\n\n1996\n01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:47,330\njust trying to get enough\nwrong to lock me out.\n\n1997\n01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:49,510\nAnd now, I'm locked out and\nI can't get back in.\n\n1998\n01:38:49,510 --> 01:38:51,880\nSo I'm gonna rely on somebody\nelse to let me back in.\n\n1999\n01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:54,900\nSo it can be nice to set a window to say,\nall right,\n\n2000\n01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:57,560\nit will unlock after this amount of time,\nI'm gonna bump it up to an hour.\n\n2001\n01:38:58,630 --> 01:39:02,830\nSo if somebody gets locked out,\nstop logins for that user for an hour.\n\n2002\n01:39:02,830 --> 01:39:06,510\nIf somebody's trying to brute force,\nafter that hour when they can't log in,\n\n2003\n01:39:06,510 --> 01:39:08,940\nthey'll just give up and\nmove to another account.\n\n2004\n01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:12,160\nThis will effectively stop them\nfrom being able to brute force.\n\n2005\n01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:14,220\nIt'll just take too long for\nthem to guess that password.\n\n2006\n01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:21,020\nSo with my password policy set nice and\nstrong, and\n\n2007\n01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:26,140\nmy account lock out policy set,\nnow I've got a fairly secure environment.\n\n2008\n01:39:26,140 --> 01:39:28,980\nNow, this isn't gonna stop users from\nwriting a password on a post it note and\n\n2009\n01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:30,460\nsticking it on their monitor.\n\n2010\n01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:32,080\nThat's still an issue, but\n\n2011\n01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:35,530\nthat's kinda beyond what we can cover\nhere with a group policy object.\n\n2012\n01:39:35,530 --> 01:39:38,713\nThere's no anti-sticky note policy.\n\n2013\n01:39:38,713 --> 01:39:40,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So those are some of the things we can\n\n2014\n01:39:40,980 --> 01:39:42,270\ndefine right there.\n\n2015\n01:39:42,270 --> 01:39:46,300\nSetting them here at the domain level like\nI'm doing in this default domain policy\n\n2016\n01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:49,620\nwill apply to every user\naccount in my domain.\n\n2017\n01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:50,552\nAnd that's very, very effective.\n\n2018\n01:39:50,552 --> 01:39:52,746\nIt ensures everybody lives\nup to the same standards.\n\n2019\n01:39:52,746 --> 01:39:59,400\nBut you may have different policies for\nthe mailroom clerk versus the CEO.\n\n2020\n01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:01,390\nThere may be different policies for them.\n\n2021\n01:40:01,390 --> 01:40:04,954\nSo you may need to change and\nenforce that differently for them.\n\n2022\n01:40:04,954 --> 01:40:10,791\n>> Now Don, also in the exam objectives,\nit does call out recovery and disablement.\n\n2023\n01:40:10,791 --> 01:40:14,115\nSo let's say that this user has tried\none of those password attempts.\n\n2024\n01:40:14,115 --> 01:40:17,250\nAnd you come in Monday, it was a rough\nweekend, and they're cramming it in, and\n\n2025\n01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:19,200\nthey do not remember even changing it.\n\n2026\n01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:21,840\nSo now,\nlet's take a look at the user account.\n\n2027\n01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:26,050\nSo now that the account is locked out,\nthen now what?\n\n2028\n01:40:26,050 --> 01:40:27,670\nHow do we unlock it?\n\n2029\n01:40:27,670 --> 01:40:29,310\n>> Yeah.\nSo the administrator has a slightly\n\n2030\n01:40:29,310 --> 01:40:30,850\ndifferent interface for the user account.\n\n2031\n01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:33,070\nThey have what's called\nActive Directory Users and Computers.\n\n2032\n01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:34,230\nLet me get into that.\n\n2033\n01:40:34,230 --> 01:40:35,740\nSo I'm gonna go back to my Server Manager,\nand\n\n2034\n01:40:35,740 --> 01:40:39,070\nI'll just go to Tools >\nActive Directory Users and Computers.\n\n2035\n01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:42,380\nAnd I'll go and find a user account.\n\n2036\n01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:45,550\nSo when I go in here under Users,\nactually, I guess I don't have one.\n\n2037\n01:40:45,550 --> 01:40:46,420\nLet me make an account for me.\n\n2038\n01:40:48,530 --> 01:40:50,209\nSo I'm just gonna whip up an account for\nme real quick.\n\n2039\n01:40:54,441 --> 01:40:54,941\nHere we go.\n\n2040\n01:41:03,067 --> 01:41:04,681\nSo now, I've got the account.\n\n2041\n01:41:04,681 --> 01:41:08,910\nAnd let's say, I try and login, and I try\nand login a bunch, and I get locked out.\n\n2042\n01:41:08,910 --> 01:41:12,864\nWell, the administrator can come in here,\nand if you right-click on the account,\n\n2043\n01:41:12,864 --> 01:41:16,090\nyou'll see where I've got\nlike disable account.\n\n2044\n01:41:16,090 --> 01:41:18,320\nI can disable the account manually.\n\n2045\n01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,620\nAnd now, there's a little black arrow\non there letting me know that Don\n\n2046\n01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:21,820\ncan't login.\n\n2047\n01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:24,670\nThen now, if I right-click,\nI've got Enable Account.\n\n2048\n01:41:24,670 --> 01:41:28,960\nBut that's different than when they\nget locked for an invalid password.\n\n2049\n01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:32,708\nThis is disabling the account,\nnot locking it.\n\n2050\n01:41:32,708 --> 01:41:37,120\nIf I double-click on the user,\nand I go to the Account tab,\n\n2051\n01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:41,560\nit's under the Account tab that\nwe see this, Unlock Account.\n\n2052\n01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:44,990\nIf the account had put in enough\ninvalid passwords to get locked,\n\n2053\n01:41:44,990 --> 01:41:46,300\nthat would be checked.\n\n2054\n01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:50,790\nAnd notice when I lock the account and\nI look back here, there's no difference.\n\n2055\n01:41:50,790 --> 01:41:52,080\nI don't see a little down arrow,\n\n2056\n01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:55,280\nthere's no indicator right here\nthat lets me know they're locked.\n\n2057\n01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:58,580\nSo they call the help desk, I call in and\nI say, hey, guys, I'm sorry,\n\n2058\n01:41:58,580 --> 01:42:02,390\nI changed my password yesterday, and\nI just can't seem to remember it today.\n\n2059\n01:42:02,390 --> 01:42:03,770\nI got locked out, can you unlock me?\n\n2060\n01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:06,350\nAnd they can come in here.\n\n2061\n01:42:06,350 --> 01:42:10,143\nThey can go into the Account tab,\nand they can unlock the account,\n\n2062\n01:42:10,143 --> 01:42:12,255\nwhich apparently unlocked itself?\n\n2063\n01:42:12,255 --> 01:42:16,490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know what?\n\n2064\n01:42:16,490 --> 01:42:17,124\nI'm hitting Unlock.\n\n2065\n01:42:18,505 --> 01:42:20,755\nSo this is just unlock.\n\n2066\n01:42:20,755 --> 01:42:21,745\nIt doesn't actually lock.\n\n2067\n01:42:21,745 --> 01:42:25,944\nSo to lock the account, I would have to go\nin and put in a bunch of bad passwords.\n\n2068\n01:42:25,944 --> 01:42:28,243\nNow, this account is disabled.\n\n2069\n01:42:28,243 --> 01:42:30,347\nThat's the same as disabling it.\n\n2070\n01:42:30,347 --> 01:42:33,933\nBut yeah, it doesn't actually have\nwhere I can check off to lock it.\n\n2071\n01:42:33,933 --> 01:42:36,783\nI'd have to do a bunch of bad passwords,\nwhich I guess I could do.\n\n2072\n01:42:36,783 --> 01:42:38,107\nCan be fun.\n\n2073\n01:42:38,107 --> 01:42:39,262\nWhat did I set it to?\n\n2074\n01:42:39,262 --> 01:42:41,520\n>> Your password?\n\n2075\n01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:43,053\nI guess you-\n>> No,\n\n2076\n01:42:43,053 --> 01:42:45,700\nhow many invalid attempts did I set it to?\n\n2077\n01:42:45,700 --> 01:42:46,487\n>> Ten, I think.\n\n2078\n01:42:46,487 --> 01:42:52,304\n>> Let's just do this.\n\n2079\n01:42:52,304 --> 01:42:57,208\nWhere's my Run as Other User option?\n\n2080\n01:42:57,208 --> 01:43:00,808\nIt is a domain controller so\nI can't login as my regular user account.\n\n2081\n01:43:00,808 --> 01:43:05,590\nWell anyhow, if it were locked, I would\njust check that box to say unlock, and\n\n2082\n01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:08,496\nthat would unlock it,\nthat's how that works.\n\n2083\n01:43:08,496 --> 01:43:13,410\nSo easy enough to go about it, but\nslightly confusing just because there's\n\n2084\n01:43:13,410 --> 01:43:17,709\nthe Disable option which kind of\nsounds like the locking side, but\n\n2085\n01:43:17,709 --> 01:43:18,890\nit is different.\n\n2086\n01:43:18,890 --> 01:43:22,240\nThat will actually disable the account\noutright, which will stop the account from\n\n2087\n01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:25,995\nworking all together, versus locking it\nwhich just stops it from authenticating.\n\n2088\n01:43:25,995 --> 01:43:27,730\nYou can't get into the system\nwhile it's locked,\n\n2089\n01:43:27,730 --> 01:43:30,260\nand then we can come in and\nunlock it right there.\n\n2090\n01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:35,040\nSo that's how we handle it\nas far as the lock side.\n\n2091\n01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:37,558\nBut what if the person forgot their\npassword and they say, hey, I'm sorry,\n\n2092\n01:43:37,558 --> 01:43:39,593\nI changed my password yesterday,\nI just can't remember it.\n\n2093\n01:43:39,593 --> 01:43:42,739\nI got locked, can you unlock me, and\nlet me know what my password is?\n\n2094\n01:43:42,739 --> 01:43:44,591\nWell, we can unlock them, but\n\n2095\n01:43:44,591 --> 01:43:48,380\nwe can't tell them what their\npassword was cuz we don't know.\n\n2096\n01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:51,530\nAnd it's stored in non-reversible\nencryption, so there's no way for\n\n2097\n01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:52,460\nus to get it.\n\n2098\n01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:56,283\nAs an administrator, the only thing we can\ndo is right-click on that account, and\n\n2099\n01:43:56,283 --> 01:43:57,441\nchoose Reset Password.\n\n2100\n01:43:57,441 --> 01:44:01,852\nWe can reset their password to\nsomething that they do know.\n\n2101\n01:44:01,852 --> 01:44:06,295\nAnd so I can tell them, hey,\nI'm setting your password to don123, or\n\n2102\n01:44:06,295 --> 01:44:07,377\nwhatever Right?\n\n2103\n01:44:07,377 --> 01:44:12,271\nBut the next time you log in,\nyou need to change the password.\n\n2104\n01:44:12,271 --> 01:44:15,860\nPut it to something else that\nyou can remember, right?\n\n2105\n01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:18,470\nBecause if we just tell them\na password and they keep it,\n\n2106\n01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:20,020\nnow I know what their password is.\n\n2107\n01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:23,690\nBut if we say, you've got to change\nit at next login, now I don't know.\n\n2108\n01:44:23,690 --> 01:44:25,470\nThey're the only one's who know\nwhat their password is and\n\n2109\n01:44:25,470 --> 01:44:26,840\nthat's how we should do it.\n\n2110\n01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:28,770\nActually we've got the Unlock Option\nright there too so\n\n2111\n01:44:28,770 --> 01:44:31,160\nwe could unlock them if\nthey were already locked.\n\n2112\n01:44:32,932 --> 01:44:36,880\nAll right, so we can set that,\nand I picked a weak password so\n\n2113\n01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:37,760\nit's flagging me here.\n\n2114\n01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:40,330\nIt won't let me reset it because\nI picked one that was too weak.\n\n2115\n01:44:40,330 --> 01:44:41,960\nSo let me reset that again.\n\n2116\n01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:45,150\nAnd I'll punch in something\na little stronger this time.\n\n2117\n01:44:48,610 --> 01:44:50,170\nAnd there we go.\nSo now it's been reset.\n\n2118\n01:44:50,170 --> 01:44:52,230\nI can tell the user what I\njust set their password to,\n\n2119\n01:44:52,230 --> 01:44:56,800\nand when they log in they'll have\nto change the password to match it.\n\n2120\n01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:59,070\nAnd actually here, let me switch machines.\n\n2121\n01:44:59,070 --> 01:45:01,410\nWho should I use?\n\n2122\n01:45:01,410 --> 01:45:02,740\nLet me try one of these clients.\n\n2123\n01:45:06,020 --> 01:45:07,340\nOops.\n\n2124\n01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:10,420\nLet me change this screen resolution so\nwe can actually see what's going on.\n\n2125\n01:45:12,690 --> 01:45:13,190\nRight.\n\n2126\n01:45:14,630 --> 01:45:15,470\nOkay.\n\n2127\n01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:17,430\nSo what I'm going to do\nis I'm going to log out.\n\n2128\n01:45:17,430 --> 01:45:21,560\nAnd I'm going to log in as Don Pezet.\n\n2129\n01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:26,720\nNow my password just got reset a moment\nago, so when I go to login here as dpezet,\n\n2130\n01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:31,310\nI'll punch in what the help desk told me,\nwhat they told me my password was, and\n\n2131\n01:45:31,310 --> 01:45:34,580\nnow it tells me the user's\npassword must be changed.\n\n2132\n01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:39,130\nSo now I can punch it in and put in\nwhatever I want my password to be and\n\n2133\n01:45:39,130 --> 01:45:40,720\nthe help desk doesn't know it.\n\n2134\n01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:44,480\nI'm the only one who knows what it is and\nI can get in.\n\n2135\n01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:47,220\nThe value provided does not meet\nthe length, complexity or history.\n\n2136\n01:45:47,220 --> 01:45:48,479\n>> Uh-oh.\n>> Oh, the history,\n\n2137\n01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:52,850\nI put in the password that I had before,\nso I violated the history side of things.\n\n2138\n01:45:52,850 --> 01:45:56,902\nSo let me just put in gators321.\n\n2139\n01:45:56,902 --> 01:46:00,380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Oh shoot, and\n\n2140\n01:46:00,380 --> 01:46:05,200\nthen I retype, dadgummit,\nthis is why I can't have nice things.\n\n2141\n01:46:08,530 --> 01:46:10,430\nWatch, now it's gonna tell me they\ndon't match, nope, there we go.\n\n2142\n01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:14,270\nAll right, so now I'm logged in and I'm\nback in business as the end user, okay?\n\n2143\n01:46:14,270 --> 01:46:17,132\nI guess I coulda locked myself right\nthere if I put it in wrong enough times.\n\n2144\n01:46:17,132 --> 01:46:21,392\n[LAUGH] So, now we get to wait for\nthat thing.\n\n2145\n01:46:21,392 --> 01:46:23,690\nAnd actually, while we're here,\nI probably could go ahead.\n\n2146\n01:46:24,870 --> 01:46:26,940\nWindows does this interesting thing.\n\n2147\n01:46:26,940 --> 01:46:32,070\nIf you go to log in and you start putting\nin the wrong password enough times,\n\n2148\n01:46:32,070 --> 01:46:35,690\nit will actually start to\nslow down the log in process.\n\n2149\n01:46:35,690 --> 01:46:37,370\nLet me show you what I mean by that.\n\n2150\n01:46:37,370 --> 01:46:41,640\nIt's kind of like an anti-brute force\nstuff but it's super, super primitive.\n\n2151\n01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:45,590\nHere, let me just log out of this machine.\n\n2152\n01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:50,540\nAnd what I'll do is, I'll come in and\nI'll start to log in incorrectly.\n\n2153\n01:46:52,690 --> 01:46:56,870\nSo I'm going to log in as dpezet, and\nI'm gonna put in the wrong password, okay?\n\n2154\n01:46:56,870 --> 01:47:00,240\nNow see how it immediately\ntold me that that was wrong?\n\n2155\n01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:02,810\nAnd so then I can sit here and\nI can just keep trying to log in, and\n\n2156\n01:47:02,810 --> 01:47:05,290\nit's telling me immediately\nhow it's wrong.\n\n2157\n01:47:05,290 --> 01:47:08,628\nWell after you do enough of these,\nit'll actually start to slow down.\n\n2158\n01:47:08,628 --> 01:47:12,192\nAnd there we go.\n\n2159\n01:47:12,192 --> 01:47:14,510\nAll right, see how it says, Welcome?\n\n2160\n01:47:14,510 --> 01:47:15,910\nIt's like oh, I'm gonna get in.\n\n2161\n01:47:15,910 --> 01:47:17,520\nI just typed it in the right password.\n\n2162\n01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:18,150\nOkay?\n\n2163\n01:47:18,150 --> 01:47:19,155\nBut it actually isn't.\n\n2164\n01:47:19,155 --> 01:47:23,405\nIt's just slowing down the process,\nit's like it's rate limiting me, okay?\n\n2165\n01:47:23,405 --> 01:47:27,865\nSo I did four wrong passwords and\non the fifth one it's now slowing me down.\n\n2166\n01:47:27,865 --> 01:47:29,365\nSo if somebody's trying to brute force,\n\n2167\n01:47:29,365 --> 01:47:33,015\nthere's just built in,\nto kinda stop that from happening.\n\n2168\n01:47:33,015 --> 01:47:35,585\nSo what's gonna happen is,\nhere in a moment it's gonna tell me,\n\n2169\n01:47:35,585 --> 01:47:38,325\noh yeah, that's not right,\nit's the wrong password.\n\n2170\n01:47:38,325 --> 01:47:39,715\nAnd then I can log in again.\n\n2171\n01:47:39,715 --> 01:47:41,775\nBut now it's taking much longer.\n\n2172\n01:47:41,775 --> 01:47:42,455\nSee, there we go.\n\n2173\n01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:46,090\nAnd we can go and it's, just like I said,\n\n2174\n01:47:46,090 --> 01:47:49,130\nit's just slowing you down\nto stop that brute force.\n\n2175\n01:47:49,130 --> 01:47:52,010\nI got four rapid fire\npasswords in there but\n\n2176\n01:47:52,010 --> 01:47:55,020\nit's going to take me a while now to get\nto my, did we say it was ten was the?\n\n2177\n01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:56,270\n>> Yeah, I think so.\n\n2178\n01:47:56,270 --> 01:47:57,040\nEither ten or six.\n\n2179\n01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,115\n>> Should have picked a lower number.\n\n2180\n01:47:58,115 --> 01:48:01,019\n[LAUGH] This is what I get for\nflying by the seat of my pants.\n\n2181\n01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:05,440\nSo yeah, we said ten invalid login\nattempts in 30 minutes, and so\n\n2182\n01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:06,670\nI'm only on like, number six.\n\n2183\n01:48:06,670 --> 01:48:07,370\nIt's going to take forever\nto get beyond that.\n\n2184\n01:48:07,370 --> 01:48:08,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n2185\n01:48:08,030 --> 01:48:11,204\nI won't bore us with\nhaving to watch all that.\n\n2186\n01:48:11,204 --> 01:48:18,880\nBut basically, if I managed to get to\nthe tenth one, then it's going to stop.\n\n2187\n01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:22,500\nAnd it's not just on one computer either,\nright?\n\n2188\n01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:23,882\nSo if I'm getting some bad ones.\n\n2189\n01:48:23,882 --> 01:48:25,334\nOh, did it pick back up on speed?\n\n2190\n01:48:25,334 --> 01:48:27,075\nIt sure did.\n\n2191\n01:48:27,075 --> 01:48:31,409\nSo if I do enough incorrect on one, there\nwe go, then I can actually go to a second\n\n2192\n01:48:31,409 --> 01:48:36,290\nmachine and it'll be locked out there too,\nor it'll count towards the lockouts there.\n\n2193\n01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:39,310\nSo I just got the referenced\naccount is currently locked-out and\n\n2194\n01:48:39,310 --> 01:48:40,810\nmay not be logged in to.\n\n2195\n01:48:40,810 --> 01:48:42,524\nSo, now I actually am locked-out.\n\n2196\n01:48:43,930 --> 01:48:46,460\nAnd if I go back here\ninto my Active Directory.\n\n2197\n01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:49,060\nJust gonna refresh this.\n\n2198\n01:48:49,060 --> 01:48:50,230\nRight.\nThere's Don Pezet,\n\n2199\n01:48:50,230 --> 01:48:54,883\nsee how there's no visual cue letting\nme know that user is locked out.\n\n2200\n01:48:54,883 --> 01:48:59,915\nBut if I pull up the user,\nI can see this account is\n\n2201\n01:48:59,915 --> 01:49:03,035\ncurrently locked out on this\nActive Directory Domain Controller, and\n\n2202\n01:49:03,035 --> 01:49:07,785\nif I were to try and reset the password,\nI would see it there too.\n\n2203\n01:49:07,785 --> 01:49:11,500\nAccount lockout status on this\nDomain Controller locked out, all right.\n\n2204\n01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:14,850\nSo I know it's locked out and\nI can punch in that new password.\n\n2205\n01:49:16,410 --> 01:49:19,540\nAnd I'm gonna turn off that Must Change so\nI don't have to deal with that.\n\n2206\n01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:23,810\nAnd now its gonna unlock it and I can\njump back over that client and log in.\n\n2207\n01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:26,830\nWell in theory.\n\n2208\n01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:30,020\nAnd there we go, and\n\n2209\n01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:32,092\nit's gonna create my profile since\nit's the first time I logged in.\n\n2210\n01:49:32,092 --> 01:49:36,590\nAll right, so that's how we can strengthen\nthose user account passwords and\n\n2211\n01:49:36,590 --> 01:49:37,720\nmake them work for us.\n\n2212\n01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:39,840\nYou know, make them a lot more consistent.\n\n2213\n01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,290\nNow, what are the right numbers?\n\n2214\n01:49:41,290 --> 01:49:43,950\nYou guys saw me put a lot of\nnumbers in there as far as how\n\n2215\n01:49:43,950 --> 01:49:46,420\noften they have to change\ntheir passwords and so on.\n\n2216\n01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:48,880\nWhat are the right numbers for\nyour company?\n\n2217\n01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,300\nWell, it depends.\n\n2218\n01:49:50,300 --> 01:49:53,300\nIt depends on the level of\nsecurity you're trying to provide.\n\n2219\n01:49:53,300 --> 01:49:57,260\nIf you're a regulated industry, so\nif you have government regulations like\n\n2220\n01:49:57,260 --> 01:50:01,355\nHIPPA compliance or\nSarbanes-Oxley, SAS 70 compliance.\n\n2221\n01:50:01,355 --> 01:50:04,965\nA lot of those regulations will actually\nhave in there the minimum requirements for\n\n2222\n01:50:04,965 --> 01:50:06,255\npassword security.\n\n2223\n01:50:06,255 --> 01:50:08,835\nSo that's the minimum, and\n\n2224\n01:50:08,835 --> 01:50:12,125\na lot of times we'll see where\nthe minimum is just not very good.\n\n2225\n01:50:12,125 --> 01:50:15,255\nSo we may need to step it up,\nyou know, if you look at like,\n\n2226\n01:50:15,255 --> 01:50:19,100\nI think it's FIPS 180 where it\ndefines password complexity.\n\n2227\n01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:23,090\nIt's in there,\nit's like a minimum of 12 characters or\n\n2228\n01:50:23,090 --> 01:50:25,890\nsomething like that, but\nit's all lower case letters.\n\n2229\n01:50:25,890 --> 01:50:28,050\n>> Hm.\n>> So, no numbers, no special characters,\n\n2230\n01:50:28,050 --> 01:50:29,060\nno capital letters.\n\n2231\n01:50:29,060 --> 01:50:32,590\nSo, just because there's a government\nstandard for it doesn't mean it's strong.\n\n2232\n01:50:32,590 --> 01:50:35,400\nSo your company is gonna have different\nneeds you need to make sure you\n\n2233\n01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:37,960\npick what's appropriate for\nyour organization.\n\n2234\n01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:38,952\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, Don, so\n\n2235\n01:50:38,952 --> 01:50:41,295\nyou mentioned your user account, right.\n\n2236\n01:50:41,295 --> 01:50:46,200\nSo, your logged in there, you know,\nwe're going to try to run as that guy but\n\n2237\n01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:47,660\nyou're on the Domain Controller.\n\n2238\n01:50:47,660 --> 01:50:53,290\nWell, also into our objectives it does\ncall out group based privileges and\n\n2239\n01:50:53,290 --> 01:50:54,670\nuser assigned privileges.\n\n2240\n01:50:54,670 --> 01:50:59,290\nSo we can let this user then sign on to\nthat Domain Controller by adding him to\n\n2241\n01:50:59,290 --> 01:51:00,600\nthe appropriate group.\n\n2242\n01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:03,650\n>> Yeah, you know when we talk about\naccess control and permissions,\n\n2243\n01:51:03,650 --> 01:51:06,480\nwe're normally talking about\naccess to a file or a folder.\n\n2244\n01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:08,380\n>> But\nthere's things that are called privileges.\n\n2245\n01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:11,090\nOr Microsoft likes to call them rights,\nyou know user rights.\n\n2246\n01:51:11,090 --> 01:51:12,650\nBut, but they're privileges.\n\n2247\n01:51:12,650 --> 01:51:16,140\nThey're the ability to\nperform an action right?\n\n2248\n01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:19,470\nWhen I access a file, I'm either reading\nthe file or writing to the file,\n\n2249\n01:51:19,470 --> 01:51:21,120\ndeleting the file or\ncreating the file, right?\n\n2250\n01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:23,000\nThose are the types of things we do.\n\n2251\n01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:26,340\nBut there's non standard things,\nlike shutting down the computer.\n\n2252\n01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:27,820\nIf you shut the computer down,\nwhat are you doing?\n\n2253\n01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:29,202\nAre you writing to a file or reading?\n\n2254\n01:51:29,202 --> 01:51:30,340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're doing\n\n2255\n01:51:30,340 --> 01:51:31,560\nsomething completely different.\n\n2256\n01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:32,540\nRight?\n\n2257\n01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:35,850\nIf you change the clock on a computer,\nwhat are you doing?\n\n2258\n01:51:35,850 --> 01:51:37,780\nRight?\nThese privileges and\n\n2259\n01:51:37,780 --> 01:51:40,710\nthey're things you can turn on and\noff for users, or groups.\n\n2260\n01:51:40,710 --> 01:51:41,210\nAll right.\n\n2261\n01:51:42,330 --> 01:51:43,200\nAnd Windows does it.\n\n2262\n01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:45,970\nI could take a look on this Windows\n8 machine, or I'll use the server,\n\n2263\n01:51:45,970 --> 01:51:47,230\ncuz like you said Nate,\n\n2264\n01:51:47,230 --> 01:51:51,400\nmy regular user account is not allowed to\nlog in on a domain controller by default.\n\n2265\n01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:54,490\nThat's one of the ways that\nMicrosoft secures those, so\n\n2266\n01:51:54,490 --> 01:51:57,100\nthat's why I wasn't able\nto log on on this machine.\n\n2267\n01:51:57,100 --> 01:51:58,780\nWell, where's that come from?\n\n2268\n01:51:58,780 --> 01:51:59,960\nWell, it comes from our group policy.\n\n2269\n01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:02,469\nIt actually comes from\nthe Domain Controller policy.\n\n2270\n01:52:02,469 --> 01:52:07,502\nSo if I go here into this\nDefault Domain Controller Policy and\n\n2271\n01:52:07,502 --> 01:52:10,276\nedit that We'll find it in here.\n\n2272\n01:52:10,276 --> 01:52:13,963\nSo if I go under my computer settings and\n\n2273\n01:52:13,963 --> 01:52:19,009\nPolicies > Windows Settings\n> Security Settings.\n\n2274\n01:52:19,009 --> 01:52:24,058\nIn here, I've got my Local Policies and\n\n2275\n01:52:24,058 --> 01:52:27,480\nUser Rights Assignments.\n\n2276\n01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:29,910\nRemember I said Microsoft calls\nthese user rights, right?\n\n2277\n01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:31,260\nThey're basically privileges.\n\n2278\n01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:34,900\nAnd you'll see things in here\nlike change the system time.\n\n2279\n01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:37,640\nWho's allowed to change\nthe clock on a computer?\n\n2280\n01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:42,020\nWell, by default, Administrators and\nserver operators.\n\n2281\n01:52:42,020 --> 01:52:45,480\nA regular user cannot change the clock.\n\n2282\n01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:46,820\nThey can change the time zone.\n\n2283\n01:52:46,820 --> 01:52:47,990\nSee time zone is not defined.\n\n2284\n01:52:47,990 --> 01:52:49,680\nAnybody can change the time zone.\n\n2285\n01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:52,310\nBut the clock itself can't be changed.\n\n2286\n01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:56,710\nAnd that's because Kerberos relies on\ntime stamps to know if packets have been\n\n2287\n01:52:56,710 --> 01:52:57,600\ntampered with in transit.\n\n2288\n01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,160\nThat's one of the tools that it uses.\n\n2289\n01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:01,090\nSo you don't want anybody\nmessing with that.\n\n2290\n01:53:01,090 --> 01:53:04,660\nAllow log on locally,\nthis was the problem with my account.\n\n2291\n01:53:04,660 --> 01:53:07,270\nMy user account is just a regular user,\nbut\n\n2292\n01:53:07,270 --> 01:53:10,780\non the domain controllers,\nadministrators, back up operators,\n\n2293\n01:53:10,780 --> 01:53:13,740\naccount operators,\nregular users are not in this list.\n\n2294\n01:53:13,740 --> 01:53:16,920\nRegular users cannot log\nin to a domain controller.\n\n2295\n01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:20,160\nSo if I wanted myself to be able\nto log in, I've got two choices.\n\n2296\n01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:23,180\nI could modify this, and\nI could add myself to the list.\n\n2297\n01:53:23,180 --> 01:53:26,240\nI could add dpezet, right?\n\n2298\n01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:28,683\nSo there I am, I've added my account.\n\n2299\n01:53:28,683 --> 01:53:33,494\nBut if I have 10 administrators, I might\nnot wanna add every one of them so,\n\n2300\n01:53:33,494 --> 01:53:38,910\nyou know, one by one it's kind of a hassle\nso it'd be better to create a group.\n\n2301\n01:53:38,910 --> 01:53:42,313\nRight, and so I might have an IT\ndepartment group or something and so\n\n2302\n01:53:42,313 --> 01:53:45,854\nI would hit Add User or Group and\nI would add that group in here, right?\n\n2303\n01:53:45,854 --> 01:53:49,572\nOr, if I wanted to go super crazy and\nlose my mind, I could put domain users and\n\n2304\n01:53:49,572 --> 01:53:52,295\nlet them all in but that,\nthat would be crazy.\n\n2305\n01:53:52,295 --> 01:53:57,212\nSo, you punch them in and now they get\naccess based on the group that they're in.\n\n2306\n01:53:57,212 --> 01:53:59,990\nBut, yeah, these are privileges and\nthey're, they're different,\n\n2307\n01:53:59,990 --> 01:54:03,670\ndifferent than what we see as far as like,\naccessing a file or folder.\n\n2308\n01:54:03,670 --> 01:54:06,080\nThese are all actions that we can perform.\n\n2309\n01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:07,430\nSomewhere in here will be shutdown.\n\n2310\n01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:08,030\nOh, right there.\n\n2311\n01:54:08,030 --> 01:54:09,250\nShut down the system.\n\n2312\n01:54:09,250 --> 01:54:12,190\nSo administrators, server operators,\nprint operators, and\n\n2313\n01:54:12,190 --> 01:54:16,370\nbackup operators can shut down the server,\nbut not a domain user, right?\n\n2314\n01:54:16,370 --> 01:54:18,450\nThey can't even log in so\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n2315\n01:54:18,450 --> 01:54:20,470\nSo, these are some of the things\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n2316\n01:54:20,470 --> 01:54:22,295\nIt's a different set of permissions.\n\n2317\n01:54:22,295 --> 01:54:26,140\n>> Mm-hm, and then, playing into\nthe last little bit that we have.\n\n2318\n01:54:26,140 --> 01:54:30,030\nSo, lets say,\nwe do add the domain users, right,\n\n2319\n01:54:30,030 --> 01:54:32,860\nthat can log on to that domain controller.\n\n2320\n01:54:32,860 --> 01:54:35,340\nFor a period of time it\nflies under the radar,\n\n2321\n01:54:35,340 --> 01:54:37,690\nuntil we look at the last little bit.\n\n2322\n01:54:37,690 --> 01:54:40,150\nI have user access reviews.\n\n2323\n01:54:40,150 --> 01:54:44,152\nAnd that plays into the auditing and those\nsorts of monitoring things where we've\n\n2324\n01:54:44,152 --> 01:54:47,755\nkind of hashed again and\nagain throughout the series.\n\n2325\n01:54:47,755 --> 01:54:51,850\nBut you have to get out there and\nmake sure that users,\n\n2326\n01:54:51,850 --> 01:54:56,335\nnot only do they have those least\nprivileges, they're not creating, yeah,\n\n2327\n01:54:56,335 --> 01:54:58,950\nany unnecessary problems for\nadministrators.\n\n2328\n01:54:58,950 --> 01:55:03,610\n>> Yeah and in Windows we have user\nlogin auditing turned on by default.\n\n2329\n01:55:03,610 --> 01:55:04,650\nSo we don't even have to turn that on.\n\n2330\n01:55:04,650 --> 01:55:08,060\nI showed user auditing in another episode,\nbut\n\n2331\n01:55:08,060 --> 01:55:12,800\nlet me show you while I'm in here,\nright here under my security settings.\n\n2332\n01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:16,130\nYou'll find, let's see it is\nburied way under audit policies.\n\n2333\n01:55:16,130 --> 01:55:20,890\nSo under Security Settings >\nLocal Policies > Audit Policy.\n\n2334\n01:55:20,890 --> 01:55:22,780\nHere's where I can turn\non what gets audited.\n\n2335\n01:55:22,780 --> 01:55:27,150\nNow I know these all say not defined, that\ndoesn't mean that they're not auditing,\n\n2336\n01:55:27,150 --> 01:55:29,980\nthat just means that this\npolicy isn't enforcing it.\n\n2337\n01:55:29,980 --> 01:55:32,440\nOn the local machine they\nhave default values, and\n\n2338\n01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:34,010\nseveral of these are turned on.\n\n2339\n01:55:34,010 --> 01:55:37,210\nBut if we set them in a policy,\nit'll ensure that it gets enforced.\n\n2340\n01:55:37,210 --> 01:55:38,460\nAnd so I'm going to turn them on.\n\n2341\n01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:42,050\nNow when it comes on to log on events,\n\n2342\n01:55:42,050 --> 01:55:46,820\nnotice there's Audit account log\non events and Audit log on events.\n\n2343\n01:55:46,820 --> 01:55:48,000\nWhat's the difference?\n\n2344\n01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:52,100\nOkay, well the difference is when\nwe talk about log on events,\n\n2345\n01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:55,100\nthat's somebody logging\non to this machine.\n\n2346\n01:55:55,100 --> 01:55:58,020\nSomebody physically sitting down and\nlogging in to this machine.\n\n2347\n01:55:58,020 --> 01:56:02,010\nBut account log on events, that's\nsomebody maybe browsing over the network,\n\n2348\n01:56:02,010 --> 01:56:03,400\nto access a network share.\n\n2349\n01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:06,150\nIt's anytime a credential\nis called into play.\n\n2350\n01:56:06,150 --> 01:56:08,400\nYou may access all sorts\nof resources that way.\n\n2351\n01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:11,030\nSo it's slightly different\ntypes of access.\n\n2352\n01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:14,490\nBut I might want to audit both, so\nI may go in and choose to turn that on.\n\n2353\n01:56:14,490 --> 01:56:18,120\nNow, whenever you do auditing,\nremember this.\n\n2354\n01:56:18,120 --> 01:56:22,060\nYou can audit successes or\nfailures, or both.\n\n2355\n01:56:22,060 --> 01:56:23,750\nAnd it's kind of counterintuitive, but\n\n2356\n01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:26,200\nsuccesses are what you\nnormally want to monitor.\n\n2357\n01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:27,410\nA lot of people think, oh,\n\n2358\n01:56:27,410 --> 01:56:30,800\nfailures, I want to when somebody tried\nto do something they shouldn't have done.\n\n2359\n01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:34,310\nBut the problem with a failure is all it\ntells you is that your system worked.\n\n2360\n01:56:34,310 --> 01:56:35,722\nIt did what it was supposed to do, right?\n\n2361\n01:56:35,722 --> 01:56:36,290\n>> Mm-hm, mm-hm.\n\n2362\n01:56:36,290 --> 01:56:39,540\n>> Someone tried to log in, they\nweren't allowed, and they got stopped.\n\n2363\n01:56:39,540 --> 01:56:41,280\nThat's a failure, okay.\n\n2364\n01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:44,100\nThe only time we care about failures\nare when we're trying to track like,\n\n2365\n01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:45,770\nbrute force attempts, right?\n\n2366\n01:56:45,770 --> 01:56:48,360\nIt's going to be failure after\nfailure after failure, right?\n\n2367\n01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:50,140\nNormally we care about successes.\n\n2368\n01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:53,070\nSomebody tried to do something\nthey weren't allowed to do and\n\n2369\n01:56:53,070 --> 01:56:56,590\nthey succeeded, that's when we\nneed to know that information.\n\n2370\n01:56:56,590 --> 01:56:59,710\nSo I wanna know log on successes,\nwhen somebody tried to log in and\n\n2371\n01:56:59,710 --> 01:57:00,720\nthey succeeded.\n\n2372\n01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:02,593\nDoesn't hurt to throw the failures\nin there too, though,\n\n2373\n01:57:02,593 --> 01:57:04,010\nwe can keep a record of that.\n\n2374\n01:57:04,010 --> 01:57:07,382\nAnd I'll go ahead and do the log on\nevents too, we're just gonna double up.\n\n2375\n01:57:07,382 --> 01:57:12,870\nAll right, now because I'm doing\nthis in a group policy it applies\n\n2376\n01:57:12,870 --> 01:57:16,660\nto my domain controllers, right, this\nis my default domain controller policy.\n\n2377\n01:57:16,660 --> 01:57:21,100\nWhenever someone tries to login, it's\ngonna keep a record of that, all right?\n\n2378\n01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:26,170\nI mentioned that my user wasn't allowed to\nlog in, well did I add him to the list?\n\n2379\n01:57:26,170 --> 01:57:26,960\n>> Yeah I, I think so.\n\n2380\n01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:28,192\nI don't remember if you chose Cancel.\n\n2381\n01:57:28,192 --> 01:57:29,240\n>> Well, we'll find out right here.\n\n2382\n01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:29,980\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n2383\n01:57:29,980 --> 01:57:32,820\n>> I [LAUGH] I don't know if I hit\nCancel or OK either, so we'll see.\n\n2384\n01:57:32,820 --> 01:57:34,130\nI may or may not be applied.\n\n2385\n01:57:34,130 --> 01:57:35,620\nSo I'm gonna try and log in.\n\n2386\n01:57:35,620 --> 01:57:37,090\nLet's see what happens.\n\n2387\n01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:39,220\nAll right.\n\n2388\n01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:42,430\nThe sign in method you're trying\nto use isn't allowed, for\n\n2389\n01:57:42,430 --> 01:57:44,640\nmore info contact your\nnetwork administrator.\n\n2390\n01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:47,358\nSo I'm not being allowed,\nI'm a regular user,\n\n2391\n01:57:47,358 --> 01:57:50,370\nI don't have the log\non locally permission.\n\n2392\n01:57:50,370 --> 01:57:54,250\nI can still log on though, right, and what\nI mean by logging on is I can access it\n\n2393\n01:57:54,250 --> 01:57:58,070\nfrom the network, if I go to one of\nthese clients where I'm logged in.\n\n2394\n01:57:58,070 --> 01:57:59,440\nSo here, this is me.\n\n2395\n01:57:59,440 --> 01:58:01,890\nI'm logged in as Don, right?\n\n2396\n01:58:01,890 --> 01:58:08,170\nAnd if I browse my network, and I browse\nto that server, I'll see it out there.\n\n2397\n01:58:08,170 --> 01:58:09,910\nActually, it probably doesn't\nhave any sharing on, and\n\n2398\n01:58:09,910 --> 01:58:12,640\nwhat is that server even called?\n\n2399\n01:58:12,640 --> 01:58:13,550\nIt's called DC.\n\n2400\n01:58:13,550 --> 01:58:17,762\nSo if I try and browse to \\\\DC,\n\n2401\n01:58:17,762 --> 01:58:25,256\nI'm browsing over the network,\nwhy are my backspaces.\n\n2402\n01:58:25,256 --> 01:58:28,020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What have I done to my keyboard?\n\n2403\n01:58:28,020 --> 01:58:29,094\nHere, I'll use the on screen keyboard.\n\n2404\n01:58:29,094 --> 01:58:30,938\n>> There we go.\n\n2405\n01:58:32,943 --> 01:58:35,240\n>> Or not.\n\n2406\n01:58:35,240 --> 01:58:39,800\nDon't I get the,\nthat's the lamest on screen keyboard ever.\n\n2407\n01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:43,040\nWell normally I would type my backslashes,\nbut instead I'm getting apostrophes so\n\n2408\n01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:44,690\nsomething on my keyboard\nis not mapped right.\n\n2409\n01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:50,500\nWell anyhow, if I were to browse\nover the network to that server,\n\n2410\n01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:55,300\nI would be able to see it and I'd be able\nto access shares that I had permission to.\n\n2411\n01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:56,830\nI'm just not allowed to log in locally.\n\n2412\n01:58:56,830 --> 01:58:59,490\nThat's why it said the method\nthat I was using wasn't allowed.\n\n2413\n01:58:59,490 --> 01:59:02,370\nActually, I could try it from like\na command prompt or whatever.\n\n2414\n01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:04,650\nDo a net view.\n\n2415\n01:59:06,180 --> 01:59:07,000\nLet's see what turns up.\n\n2416\n01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,710\nI guess I haven't really created any\nshared folders on that server, so\n\n2417\n01:59:09,710 --> 01:59:11,390\nI'm probably not gonna turn up anything.\n\n2418\n01:59:11,390 --> 01:59:12,850\nBut, well it's got net logon.\n\n2419\n01:59:12,850 --> 01:59:14,675\nI should at least see that right?\n\n2420\n01:59:14,675 --> 01:59:17,495\nAnd in fact, instead of waiting\non this thing, here we go,\n\n2421\n01:59:17,495 --> 01:59:22,770\nI can just do like a net use x colon\n[COUGH] I can't type the backslashes.\n\n2422\n01:59:22,770 --> 01:59:23,965\nDadgummit.\n\n2423\n01:59:23,965 --> 01:59:26,725\nI was gonna try and map a drive to it but\nif I can't type my backslashes,\n\n2424\n01:59:26,725 --> 01:59:27,295\nthat's really gonna.\n\n2425\n01:59:27,295 --> 01:59:30,965\nI wonder why the virtual machines\nare not letting me do that?\n\n2426\n01:59:30,965 --> 01:59:32,227\nHm, all right.\n\n2427\n01:59:32,227 --> 01:59:36,470\nWell, anyhow, so, you know,\nwe'd be able to browse to it and\n\n2428\n01:59:36,470 --> 01:59:37,850\nwe would be able to\naccess via the network.\n\n2429\n01:59:37,850 --> 01:59:40,520\nNow I can jump over to that server and\n\n2430\n01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:43,590\nwhen I attempted to log in it stopped me,\nright?\n\n2431\n01:59:43,590 --> 01:59:45,830\nBut it should have also logged that.\n\n2432\n01:59:45,830 --> 01:59:47,898\nSo if I get logged back in.\n\n2433\n01:59:54,074 --> 02:00:00,090\n[LAUGH] Oh, one of these days I'll\nremember a password around here.\n\n2434\n02:00:00,090 --> 02:00:00,640\nThere we go.\n\n2435\n02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:05,843\nYeah, Will, I could try ping.\n\n2436\n02:00:05,843 --> 02:00:08,966\nPing is a sessionless protocol so\nit doesn't actually authenticate it.\n\n2437\n02:00:08,966 --> 02:00:11,590\nIt wouldn't trip the, the log on alerts.\n\n2438\n02:00:11,590 --> 02:00:13,372\nIt's not an actual log on activity.\n\n2439\n02:00:13,372 --> 02:00:16,965\nSo I, it wouldn't get what I need.\n\n2440\n02:00:16,965 --> 02:00:19,943\nI'm not sure why my backslash key,\nI wonder if it works in this VM.\n\n2441\n02:00:19,943 --> 02:00:22,186\nMaybe it's just that particular VM.\n\n2442\n02:00:22,186 --> 02:00:24,167\nRight, no, it's doing it here too.\n\n2443\n02:00:24,167 --> 02:00:25,014\nIt's probably cause I'm on a Mac.\n\n2444\n02:00:25,014 --> 02:00:27,028\nSee that's why you use a Mac.\n\n2445\n02:00:27,028 --> 02:00:32,554\n[LAUGH] Anyhow, so now I can go in and I\nshould be able to see that logon attempt.\n\n2446\n02:00:32,554 --> 02:00:33,452\nIf I go into my,\n\n2447\n02:00:33,452 --> 02:00:37,540\nwell actually I could have done it\nfrom the Server Manager right here.\n\n2448\n02:00:37,540 --> 02:00:41,520\nIf I go to Tools, and Event Viewer,\n\n2449\n02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:47,250\ninside of my Event Viewer, I can go over\nto my Windows logs, and my Security log.\n\n2450\n02:00:47,250 --> 02:00:52,230\nThe Security log is where all those audits\nare going, and I will see log on and\n\n2451\n02:00:52,230 --> 02:00:53,010\nlog off events in there.\n\n2452\n02:00:53,010 --> 02:00:55,880\nSee, there's a log off event,\nthere's a log on event, and\n\n2453\n02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:57,110\nI can find things that way.\n\n2454\n02:00:57,110 --> 02:01:03,630\nNow, on a domain controller, these logs,\nthey will really fill up fast.\n\n2455\n02:01:03,630 --> 02:01:09,440\nI mean, you can get a ton of information\nin here if you aren't keeping tabs on it.\n\n2456\n02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:13,270\nSo because of that, you'll usually\nhave to use your search function.\n\n2457\n02:01:13,270 --> 02:01:16,815\nSo that's what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna do\na quick search on here, so I'll hit Find,\n\n2458\n02:01:16,815 --> 02:01:18,915\nand I'm just going to search for dpezet.\n\n2459\n02:01:18,915 --> 02:01:20,406\nI want to find any\nactivities that I performed.\n\n2460\n02:01:20,406 --> 02:01:24,773\nSo it's just going to search\nthrough the 5400 events and\n\n2461\n02:01:24,773 --> 02:01:28,453\nit's going to see if it\ncan't find any from me, and\n\n2462\n02:01:28,453 --> 02:01:33,609\nit looks like it found one here,\nit's, wait, is it still searching?\n\n2463\n02:01:33,609 --> 02:01:38,224\nHm, all right, there we go.\n\n2464\n02:01:38,224 --> 02:01:40,492\nThere's a log on event right there, and so\n\n2465\n02:01:40,492 --> 02:01:43,894\nI can see this log on event that\nhappened and if I take a look at it,\n\n2466\n02:01:43,894 --> 02:01:47,864\nI can see Account Name, DC$, so\nthis happened on the domain controller.\n\n2467\n02:01:47,864 --> 02:01:52,563\nAnd I can look and I can see dpezet,\nand then right here,\n\n2468\n02:01:52,563 --> 02:01:58,200\nthe user has not been granted\nthe requested logon type at this machine.\n\n2469\n02:01:58,200 --> 02:02:02,880\nThis is where I tried to log in and\nI failed, I wasn't able to log in.\n\n2470\n02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:07,141\nAll right, but\nthat shouldn't be the only one.\n\n2471\n02:02:07,141 --> 02:02:11,030\nI should see other logon events in here,\nlike this one.\n\n2472\n02:02:11,030 --> 02:02:12,779\nHere's an audit success, right?\n\n2473\n02:02:12,779 --> 02:02:17,983\nSo here is where we had an authentication\nprocess occur in a null SID,\n\n2474\n02:02:17,983 --> 02:02:20,242\noh, this is just the system.\n\n2475\n02:02:20,242 --> 02:02:22,718\nYeah, this is one of the reasons\nwhy the logs fill up so\n\n2476\n02:02:22,718 --> 02:02:26,022\nmuch is system services will trip\nthe logs also as they authenticate and\n\n2477\n02:02:26,022 --> 02:02:28,363\nthey'll show up like this\nwithout a user name so.\n\n2478\n02:02:28,363 --> 02:02:32,333\nSo that's not a particular person.\n\n2479\n02:02:32,333 --> 02:02:37,197\nSome of these will be like from when I\nran that net view command and stuff.\n\n2480\n02:02:37,197 --> 02:02:41,010\nBut, yeah, so we can poke around in here.\n\n2481\n02:02:41,010 --> 02:02:43,950\nI usually search by the username\nbecause that makes it a lot easier.\n\n2482\n02:02:43,950 --> 02:02:45,313\nYou don't have to sift\nthrough all this other stuff.\n\n2483\n02:02:45,313 --> 02:02:48,146\nSo let me go back to searching for dpezet.\n\n2484\n02:02:48,146 --> 02:02:49,759\nWe'll pull up some of those other ones.\n\n2485\n02:02:49,759 --> 02:02:52,284\nAll right, here's a special logon.\n\n2486\n02:02:52,284 --> 02:02:52,865\nIt's special.\n\n2487\n02:02:52,865 --> 02:02:57,080\nSo here you can see I'm doing\nsome kind of privilege check.\n\n2488\n02:02:58,330 --> 02:03:01,550\nHm, and so here it was just doing\na privilege check to see what I had,\n\n2489\n02:03:01,550 --> 02:03:04,630\nand succeeded to find out that I don't\nhave the privilege to log in and\n\n2490\n02:03:04,630 --> 02:03:05,880\nthen block me, right?\n\n2491\n02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:07,660\nThat's all stored there,\nin the audit logs.\n\n2492\n02:03:07,660 --> 02:03:12,530\nNow, in real life land,\nthe audit logs fill up really fast, and\n\n2493\n02:03:12,530 --> 02:03:13,520\nthey're really complex.\n\n2494\n02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:14,930\nThey're not easy to read.\n\n2495\n02:03:14,930 --> 02:03:19,040\nI mean, even these log on and log off\nmessages, when you look at some of these,\n\n2496\n02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:23,400\nthey are not the easiest things to read,\nyou know, just going down and\n\n2497\n02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:25,380\ntrying to interpret what's happening.\n\n2498\n02:03:25,380 --> 02:03:29,040\nHere's administrator logging in,\nit does get kind of confusing.\n\n2499\n02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:32,790\nSo, you might want to leverage third party\nsoftware to be able to help with this.\n\n2500\n02:03:32,790 --> 02:03:36,100\nThere's a lot of third party\nevent log monitoring packages,\n\n2501\n02:03:36,100 --> 02:03:41,600\nlike, GFI has a big one,\nshoot, what is it called?\n\n2502\n02:03:41,600 --> 02:03:43,900\nGFI Event Manager,\nI think is what it's called.\n\n2503\n02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:46,680\nAnd where it will sift this stuff and\nturn it into plain English and\n\n2504\n02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:47,930\nthat's pretty handy.\n\n2505\n02:03:47,930 --> 02:03:51,351\nAlso, other products,\nlike Cisco Mars and Symantec BindView,\n\n2506\n02:03:51,351 --> 02:03:54,286\nthey can interpret this stuff and\nturn it into reports.\n\n2507\n02:03:54,286 --> 02:03:58,298\nAnd you can say, give me a report on\ndpezet, and it'll show you what machines\n\n2508\n02:03:58,298 --> 02:04:01,846\nthey logged into, what time they\nlogged on, when they logged off.\n\n2509\n02:04:01,846 --> 02:04:03,569\nYou can get a full record\nof all their activities.\n\n2510\n02:04:03,569 --> 02:04:06,280\nIt's a lot easier than sifting\nthrough the logs by hand.\n\n2511\n02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:09,120\nSo that's all a part of monitoring, and\n\n2512\n02:04:09,120 --> 02:04:11,320\nremember that monitoring\nis a continuous thing.\n\n2513\n02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:12,745\nWe always do it, day after day.\n\n2514\n02:04:12,745 --> 02:04:15,351\nIt's something that's a part of our jobs,\nso you got to stay on top of it.\n\n2515\n02:04:15,351 --> 02:04:17,534\nAll right.\n\n2516\n02:04:17,534 --> 02:04:22,520\nSo Nate I think that about wraps\nup that objective doesn't it?\n\n2517\n02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:23,040\n>> Yeah.\n\n2518\n02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:24,500\nYeah.\n>> But what else do we have here?\n\n2519\n02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:27,950\nLet me, what did I do with my,\nI got too many virtual machines up, right,\n\n2520\n02:04:27,950 --> 02:04:28,940\nhere we go.\n\n2521\n02:04:28,940 --> 02:04:31,647\nAll right, so that was our privileges,\nuser access reviews and\n\n2522\n02:04:31,647 --> 02:04:32,760\ncontinuous monitoring.\n\n2523\n02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:33,780\nYeah, that's basically it.\n\n2524\n02:04:35,050 --> 02:04:36,630\nGet a little bit of practice with this.\n\n2525\n02:04:36,630 --> 02:04:40,520\nOn the exam, there are some simulation\nquestions, they ask you to do stuff, but\n\n2526\n02:04:40,520 --> 02:04:42,730\nit's all pretty simple, right?\n\n2527\n02:04:42,730 --> 02:04:45,720\nSo they might show you something like\nthe password configuration settings and\n\n2528\n02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:49,190\ntell you, hey, you need to set this up\nto have passwords change every month and\n\n2529\n02:04:49,190 --> 02:04:50,690\nhave a minimum length of 12.\n\n2530\n02:04:50,690 --> 02:04:53,570\nAnd you're already on that screen, so\nit's not like you got to hunt and find it.\n\n2531\n02:04:53,570 --> 02:04:56,330\nBut the more that you practice with it,\nthe better you'll be at it.\n\n2532\n02:04:56,330 --> 02:05:00,150\nSo practice with it and I did it here in\nWindows, because that's what you're likely\n\n2533\n02:05:00,150 --> 02:05:04,200\nto see on the exam but if you have Linux,\nyou can do it in Linux too.\n\n2534\n02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:06,340\nAnd actually if you jump\nover to our Linux Plus show,\n\n2535\n02:05:06,340 --> 02:05:09,450\nI specifically cover that in there and\nhow to set the password policies there.\n\n2536\n02:05:09,450 --> 02:05:13,370\nSo, there's a lot of differences,\nI covered it in our Mac OS shows too.\n\n2537\n02:05:13,370 --> 02:05:18,180\nIf you take a look at the Mac, not\nintegration basics, but the Mac management\n\n2538\n02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:22,560\nbasics show in that one, I show how to\nset password policies for your Macs too.\n\n2539\n02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:24,880\nSo we cover that from\ndifferent operating systems.\n\n2540\n02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:26,858\nOn the exam, you're most likely\ngoing to see WIndows though.\n\n2541\n02:05:26,858 --> 02:05:32,030\nAll right, well, let me just\nremind you guys that if you have\n\n2542\n02:05:32,030 --> 02:05:36,030\nquestions on any of this, check out our\nwell, we've got a couple of ways right?\n\n2543\n02:05:36,030 --> 02:05:39,180\nIf it's live during the show,\ngo to itpro.tv/live.\n\n2544\n02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:40,870\nYou're probably there right now right?\n\n2545\n02:05:40,870 --> 02:05:44,710\nThere's a chat box right beneath the\nvideo, you can post your questions there.\n\n2546\n02:05:44,710 --> 02:05:46,620\nWe monitor and answer during the show.\n\n2547\n02:05:46,620 --> 02:05:50,490\nIf you have questions after the show,\nuse our Q&A forums.\n\n2548\n02:05:50,490 --> 02:05:53,518\nThere's a link at the top of every\npage that says Q&A, click on it.\n\n2549\n02:05:53,518 --> 02:05:55,010\nIt'll take you to the forums.\n\n2550\n02:05:55,010 --> 02:05:56,480\nYou can post your questions there.\n\n2551\n02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:59,650\nWe monitor and answer.\n\n2552\n02:05:59,650 --> 02:06:01,190\nOther than that,\nthat's about all I've got for this one.\n\n2553\n02:06:01,190 --> 02:06:02,460\nYou got anything else, Nate?\n\n2554\n02:06:02,460 --> 02:06:03,670\n>> Yeah, I'm good.\n\n2555\n02:06:03,670 --> 02:06:05,760\n>> All right.\nWell, I hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n2556\n02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:07,620\nSigning off for IT Pro TV, I'm Don Pizet.\n\n2557\n02:06:07,620 --> 02:06:09,040\n>> And I'm Nathan Copeland.\n\n2558\n02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:09,846\n>> And we will see you next time.\n\n2559\n02:06:09,846 --> 02:06:14,929\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:11.863\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:11.863 --> 00:00:14.867\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another\nCompTIA Security+ episode.\n\n5\n00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:17.069\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n6\n00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.420\nIn this episode, we're going to be looking\nat comparing authentication services.\n\n7\n00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.450\nWe have a lot of different\ntypes available to us.\n\n8\n00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.110\nSo, to help us understand and\n\n9\n00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.850\nsift through all the different types,\nwe have with us Mr. Ronnie Wong.\n\n10\n00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.530\nThank you for being with us today, Ronnie.\n\n11\n00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.190\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for\n\n12\n00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.800\nhaving me back on the show as we\ncontinue on with some CompTIA Security+.\n\n13\n00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.170\nSpecifically taking a look at some of\nthe different authentication methods\n\n14\n00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.500\nthat you're gonna likely encounter\nas you enter into the world of IT.\n\n15\n00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.560\nAnd that is because it becomes more and\n\n16\n00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.332\nmore complex as your networks continue\nto grow and become more complex.\n\n17\n00:00:51.332 --> 00:00:53.900\nYou're gonna see that\nmaybe sometimes learning\n\n18\n00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.200\nbasic authentication is not enough.\n\n19\n00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.040\nAnd there's actually gonna be more\nthings that you have to put in there.\n\n20\n00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.740\nSo let's go ahead and talk about\nthe idea of basic authentication so\n\n21\n00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.690\nthat we have this understanding and\nthis need of what has to happen, okay?\n\n22\n00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.340\nSo it was fairly simple in\nthe earliest days of networking.\n\n23\n00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.560\nYou put something somewhere that\nyou needed to get access to.\n\n24\n00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.790\nWell it was just pretty much,\nas long as you could connect to that\n\n25\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.190\nparticular device that held the file that\nyou needed, you could get access to it.\n\n26\n00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.630\nYou pretty much got access to everything,\nand that was pretty much it.\n\n27\n00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.720\n&gt;&gt; And then what happened?\n\n28\n00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.615\n&gt;&gt; Well what happened is fairly simple.\n\n29\n00:01:27.615 --> 00:01:29.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Human nature happened, right?\n\n30\n00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.760\n&gt;&gt; Human nature, but\nit also meant that everybody else could.\n\n31\n00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.420\nIn other words, if you could do it,\n\n32\n00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.710\nit probably meant that everybody\nelse could do it as well, okay?\n\n33\n00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.087\nSo somebody started thinking\nabout the idea, and\n\n34\n00:01:39.087 --> 00:01:41.190\nwhat they came up with\nis a simple solution.\n\n35\n00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.546\nIt's the same solution I would think here\nis, I need to put some type of lock on\n\n36\n00:01:45.546 --> 00:01:49.320\nthat, so that I'm the only\none that really has a key.\n\n37\n00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.450\nWell, the problem is that we're talking\nabout the idea here of some type\n\n38\n00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.010\nof file that I need access to.\n\n39\n00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.290\nWhich means, over across the network,\nI can't just afford to plug it in and\n\n40\n00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.260\nunplug it every time I need it.\n\n41\n00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.390\nWhat I need to do is be able to actually\nput some type of key that will allow me to\n\n42\n00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.070\nget access in first.\n\n43\n00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.390\nSo let me show you an example of how\nthe original authentication really does\n\n44\n00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.410\ncome down to it.\n\n45\n00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.530\nSo here on my screen, I've made a diagram\nof very simple, very basic authentication.\n\n46\n00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.020\nThe first, only method,\nthat they started to do was simple.\n\n47\n00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.250\nOn the device itself, they said look,\nfor you to gain access in, for\n\n48\n00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.200\nanybody to gain access in.\n\n49\n00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.390\nWe just need to set up a password so\nthat if anybody connects in,\n\n50\n00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.600\nif they have the password,\nthey're able to get access in.\n\n51\n00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.590\nBut if they don't have the password,\nwell they're not able to get in.\n\n52\n00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.720\nAnd that's the same concept as that\nlock door I was telling you about,\n\n53\n00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.860\nat least network wide at that point.\n\n54\n00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.326\nSo, as long as I knew\nwhere the password was and\n\n55\n00:02:44.326 --> 00:02:49.500\nCherokee doesn't know where the password\nis, well that's a locked door to Cherokee.\n\n56\n00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.440\nBut it allows me to build access to\ndevice or not access to device, and\n\n57\n00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.630\nit's a simple password, okay.\n\n58\n00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.320\nNow the problem that we have here in\nterms of security is simple, okay?\n\n59\n00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.509\nOnce we have that, right, it means that if\nI accidentally let it slip somehow, so,\n\n60\n00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:06.937\nwe talked about the idea\nof social engineering.\n\n61\n00:03:06.937 --> 00:03:11.434\nSo now, let's say that Mike needs access\nto whatever is on that share, and I go,\n\n62\n00:03:11.434 --> 00:03:14.140\nokay Mike, here's what the password is.\n\n63\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.050\nAnd Cherokee is listening in and she\nhears what the password is, guess what?\n\n64\n00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.730\nThat's pretty much it, okay?\n\n65\n00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.340\nSo at that point, it becomes now\nmoot that I actually had a password.\n\n66\n00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.870\nSo it's the same reason when we\ntalk about the idea of keys, right?\n\n67\n00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.910\nAs long as nobody duplicates that key,\nyou're okay.\n\n68\n00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.990\nAs long as you kept control of the key,\nyou're okay.\n\n69\n00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.480\nBut once you don't know who has the key,\nwho doesn't have the key.\n\n70\n00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.030\nThen at that point very\ndifficult to actually say, hey,\n\n71\n00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.360\nsomebody is getting access to this or\nCherokee is getting access to this.\n\n72\n00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.010\nAnd so, even though I might go,\n\n73\n00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.160\nI know someone has accessed\nmy files on this server.\n\n74\n00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.250\nI can't go to Cherokee and say, Cherokee,\nyou're the one that's doing it.\n\n75\n00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.765\nCherokee can say, well, how,\nwhy do you think it's me?\n\n76\n00:03:55.765 --> 00:04:01.710\nCuz I say I saw you, you overheard me\ntelling Mike what the password was.\n\n77\n00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.108\nAnd I can say that and Cherokee can go,\nwell it's the passord you told Mike,\n\n78\n00:04:06.108 --> 00:04:08.510\nwhat if Mike told somebody else?\n\n79\n00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.130\nCould they have done it?\n\n80\n00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.490\nI have to admit something,\nyes, absolutely.\n\n81\n00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.470\nThey could have also gotten\naccess to it as well.\n\n82\n00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:22.450\nSo once systems like that started to break\ndown in terms of the authentication,\n\n83\n00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:29.940\nit became less and less of a fairly good\nsecurity measure to prevent access, right?\n\n84\n00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.650\nNow, at the very beginning a lot\nof devices did this, right.\n\n85\n00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.820\nWhether it was a file share, whether we\ntalked about the idea of switch or router.\n\n86\n00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.342\nThe basic principle of authentication was\njust simple, it was using a password.\n\n87\n00:04:41.342 --> 00:04:45.800\nThen it's kinda strange,\nif we take a look at my screen again,\n\n88\n00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.350\nhere's the next step in the evolution\nof the idea here of authentication.\n\n89\n00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.440\nI know this is gonna sound strange but\n\n90\n00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.490\nthis is actually considered\nadvanced security, okay?\n\n91\n00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.740\nSo at this point when we start to\ntake a look at the idea of security.\n\n92\n00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.780\nNow this is when it becomes more advanced,\nand you might go, are you joking?\n\n93\n00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.670\nA username and\npassword as advanced security?\n\n94\n00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.790\nWell, follow my scenario through again,\n\n95\n00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.550\nand kind of understand why this is\nconsidered advanced at this point, okay?\n\n96\n00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.600\nSo now we're not dependent\nupon one password right?\n\n97\n00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.900\nNow what do I do instead on this machine\n\n98\n00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.580\nis I set up this type\nof advanced security.\n\n99\n00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.542\nWhich all of are laughing like username,\npassword, advanced?\n\n100\n00:05:27.542 --> 00:05:29.550\n&gt;&gt; Well if you look at like LanMan, right?\n\n101\n00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.080\nAnd that was really it for\nthat particular day and age.\n\n102\n00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.418\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but it was considered\nadvanced and the reason why is this,\n\n103\n00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:37.900\nthere's two features that we have.\n\n104\n00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.300\nWith this, now what I can say is,\nMike, I've set up this password for\n\n105\n00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.895\nyou and it's only going to\nwork with your user account.\n\n106\n00:05:44.895 --> 00:05:49.310\nAnd/or, I can actually say, Mike,\nyou create your own password, okay?\n\n107\n00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.250\nAnd then Mike doesn't tell\nme what the password is.\n\n108\n00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.770\nSo in that sense,\nI don't have to give Mike my own password.\n\n109\n00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.320\nMike doesn't have to give\nanybody else his password.\n\n110\n00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.440\nThen everybody else said\nI want access to it.\n\n111\n00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.250\nI go all right,\nI've created an account for you.\n\n112\n00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.670\nYou just need to go in and\ncreate your own password to do this.\n\n113\n00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.320\nSo now when I do that, Cherokee comes\nin and she says, now it's asking me for\n\n114\n00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.440\na username.\n\n115\n00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.190\nWell, whose username do I choose?\n\n116\n00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.020\nIf I try and type in my own, I don't have\na password, it's not gonna let me in.\n\n117\n00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.771\nThe second advantage of this now is now\nthat we have multiple passwords on this\n\n118\n00:06:20.771 --> 00:06:21.299\nmachine.\n\n119\n00:06:21.299 --> 00:06:24.431\nIt becomes much more difficult for\nCherokee to say,\n\n120\n00:06:24.431 --> 00:06:28.490\nI didn't steal Mike's password,\nbecause it's Mike's password.\n\n121\n00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.170\nI didn't steal Ronnie's password and\nI go, yeah,\n\n122\n00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.490\nthat's my password that she used to\nget in, so I know exactly what it is.\n\n123\n00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.770\nBut the other fact is now we have\nsomething that logs who, so we do\n\n124\n00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.160\nauditing as well, who actually logged\nin at what particular point in time.\n\n125\n00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.400\nSo, now what i can do,\nis I check those logs and\n\n126\n00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.970\nI see an entry there for\nRonnie logging in over the weekend.\n\n127\n00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.770\nAnd I realize something, Ronnie wasn't\nat the building over the weekend.\n\n128\n00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.830\nBut I do see that, on the entry logs for\n\n129\n00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.160\nthe building,\nCherokee was there over the weekend.\n\n130\n00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.380\nAnd somehow she used Ronnie's\ncredentials to do so.\n\n131\n00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.292\nSo now I can tie that back and I can say,\n\n132\n00:07:05.292 --> 00:07:10.039\nsomehow Cherokee got access to\nwhat my particular password.\n\n133\n00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:14.250\nAnd she was the one that was there,\nand actually tie it back to her.\n\n134\n00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.840\nSo this particular advancement was\nkinda that next step that we saw.\n\n135\n00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.817\nSo there is this particular\npossibility that we move from basic,\n\n136\n00:07:22.817 --> 00:07:25.219\nbasic security, which is a username.\n\n137\n00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:30.049\nAnd then moving to the username, not\ninto the username, password only, sorry,\n\n138\n00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:31.320\npassword only.\n\n139\n00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.851\nTo now going to username and password,\n\n140\n00:07:33.851 --> 00:07:38.695\nto becoming more secure in that sense\nas far as basic authentication goes.\n\n141\n00:07:38.695 --> 00:07:39.563\nBut the [CROSSTALK] got more complex.\n\n142\n00:07:39.563 --> 00:07:44.093\n&gt;&gt; In that particular situation, or\nthat example you gave us Ronnie,\n\n143\n00:07:44.093 --> 00:07:47.755\nluckily we had that log of\nthe physical building logs.\n\n144\n00:07:47.755 --> 00:07:50.892\nBut now, moving forward with technology,\n\n145\n00:07:50.892 --> 00:07:55.653\nwe have this possibility of remote,\nremoting into our networks.\n\n146\n00:07:55.653 --> 00:07:59.895\nSo how would we go ahead and\nimplement security for those remote users.\n\n147\n00:07:59.895 --> 00:08:04.574\nYeah, when we start to actually take\na look at the idea of authentication,\n\n148\n00:08:04.574 --> 00:08:07.120\nit's still within the network itself.\n\n149\n00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.530\nIt's still fairly basic in this sense.\n\n150\n00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:13.670\nNow the way that we do it today is\na little bit more complex and, of course,\n\n151\n00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.220\na lot more secure than what I've talked\nabout, at least we hope that it is,\n\n152\n00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.310\nbut it's still that way.\n\n153\n00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.880\nIf Cherokee is able to actually\nknow what my username is,\n\n154\n00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.910\nit's fairly simple because most\nbusinesses follow a convention, and\n\n155\n00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.220\nall she has to do is be able to\nfigure out what my password is.\n\n156\n00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.850\nSo, if you think about it,\nif we still had this idea of some type of\n\n157\n00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:36.389\ndomain credentials such as using\na Microsoft Active Directory Network,\n\n158\n00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.070\nit's still up to Cherokee to be able to\nsocial engineer my password out of me,\n\n159\n00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.370\nand she could still log in just in\nthe same way that I was describing here.\n\n160\n00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:50.350\nBut, going further right, and this is\nwhere the world extends a bit farther,\n\n161\n00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.100\nis that now we start\nhaving what Cherokee said.\n\n162\n00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.210\nThat people are actually logging\nin from the outside, and\n\n163\n00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:00.900\nnow I can't just verify that it's\nactually charity doing it or can I, okay?\n\n164\n00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.640\nThis is where we start to actually\nimplement something else that helps us\n\n165\n00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:10.350\nwith authenticating with users from\nan untrusted network as well, and so\n\n166\n00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:16.370\none of the authentication methods that we\nend up using is one that is called RADIUS.\n\n167\n00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:19.640\nNow it's always written out\nin capital letters, but\n\n168\n00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.910\nit stands for\nremote access dial in user service.\n\n169\n00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.820\nI always get service and\nsystem confused sometimes, but\n\n170\n00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.170\nremote access dial in service,\nand this is really,\n\n171\n00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:36.840\nif you hear the term dial in you're going,\nwhy are they talking about dial in?\n\n172\n00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.070\nThat sounds like dialup\nconnections were going on,\n\n173\n00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:41.980\nand that's because that's\nwhen it was developed.\n\n174\n00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.800\n&gt;&gt; Originally that's how it started, and\n\n175\n00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.680\nsomething that's kind of interesting,\njust to throw in there.\n\n176\n00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.520\nYou won't need to know this for\nthe exam, but\n\n177\n00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.640\nthere is also an authentication service\ncalled Diameter, which is kind of a play\n\n178\n00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:59.880\non Like a play on words with RADIUS saying\nthat they're twice as good as RADIUS.\n\n179\n00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:05.330\nThey are in fact a more secure method but\nit's not as flexible, it's not as popular.\n\n180\n00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.180\nSo RADIUS integrates well with\na lot of current systems.\n\n181\n00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah there's no doubt that that's one\nof the ways that they started doing it.\n\n182\n00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:13.670\nIt was done very quickly but\n\n183\n00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:18.810\na fairly solid protocol and\neven used to this day as we continue to.\n\n184\n00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:19.590\nTo move forward.\n\n185\n00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:20.980\nThe principles are still there.\n\n186\n00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:25.910\nAnd just about everything is based around\nthis original idea of using something like\n\n187\n00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.190\nradius here.\n\n188\n00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.300\nSo when we have something like this,\nlet's talk about what it does first,\n\n189\n00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.740\nthen I'm going to show you\na diagram how it essentially works.\n\n190\n00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.560\nSo radius does something else.\n\n191\n00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.410\nSo unlike what we had before which\nwas the idea of authentication.\n\n192\n00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:43.240\nAnd just authorization,\nright the combination of user name and\n\n193\n00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.750\npassword essentially authorize you\nto get access to that device and\n\n194\n00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.260\nyou had full access you did\nnot have anything else,\n\n195\n00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.810\nwell you now have the idea that with\nradius you can do three things.\n\n196\n00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:57.930\nYou have where you can authenticate,\nyou have where it is authorized, and\n\n197\n00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:02.140\nyou can also do accounting as well,\nokay To be able to track\n\n198\n00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:07.170\neverything that you have and\nthis is considered AAA security okay?\n\n199\n00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:11.350\nAnd just about everything else that we\ndo really does feed off of this idea of\n\n200\n00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.940\nimplementing AAA security.\n\n201\n00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.948\nSo this is above that idea\nof advanced security or\n\n202\n00:11:17.948 --> 00:11:22.954\nadvanced types of authentication here,\nwas AAA security.\n\n203\n00:11:22.954 --> 00:11:25.233\n&gt;&gt; So some documentation\nthat when we're studying,\n\n204\n00:11:25.233 --> 00:11:28.047\nwe might see it as just referenced\nas a triple A server, right?\n\n205\n00:11:28.047 --> 00:11:30.460\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and there's no doubt,\nwhen you see diagrams,\n\n206\n00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.670\nyou'll probably see the idea\nof triple A server.\n\n207\n00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:36.980\nAnd it can use any method that it want to,\nbut that's what Radius does for us.\n\n208\n00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:41.960\nNow, Radius itself is based off of what\nthey call a client server model approach\n\n209\n00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.740\nto authentication, okay.\n\n210\n00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.440\nNow, let's make sure that we\ncan see what the difference is.\n\n211\n00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.340\nLet's go back here to my screen and\nthen we'll show you the process, okay.\n\n212\n00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.350\nSo on this one, I know I'm going back and\n\n213\n00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.923\nyou're like that's the most\nboring diagram in the world.\n\n214\n00:11:53.923 --> 00:11:55.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But just bear with me for\n\n215\n00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.220\na moment, okay.\n\n216\n00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.280\nRemember that what I'm doing,\n\n217\n00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.670\nI'm essentially setting up\njust a password database.\n\n218\n00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.760\nBut directly on this system.\n\n219\n00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.580\nAnd so what does that mean?\n\n220\n00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.670\nThat means if Cherokee\ncompromises that system,\n\n221\n00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.940\nshe might be able to get access to the\npassword itself, and that's pretty bad.\n\n222\n00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:15.500\nOn this one, she can gain access to\njust everybody's username and password.\n\n223\n00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.850\nAnd that's what you might\nalso end up seeing there too.\n\n224\n00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:22.090\nAnd that would be even worse because\nlike most of us that are human,\n\n225\n00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.760\nwe tend to reuse passwords.\n\n226\n00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.880\nSo Cherokee might go okay,\nnow that I've got Ronnie's password here\n\n227\n00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.370\nlet me go to another server and do what,\ntry that same username and password.\n\n228\n00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.310\nAnd maybe it happens there, okay?\n\n229\n00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:37.190\nWith Radius though, Radius is a little\nbit different in the very fact\n\n230\n00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.780\nthat when we do the authentication\n\n231\n00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:44.930\nthe authentication is not on the device\nthat we are directly going to connect to.\n\n232\n00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:50.110\nIt is essentially handed off to\na centralized authentication server okay.\n\n233\n00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.920\nSo I went ahead and made some\ndifferent colors to try and help us\n\n234\n00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:58.370\nunderstand what has to happen in the\nprocess of radius and how this works okay.\n\n235\n00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:03.350\nSo here you are, you're on a laptop\noutside in the entrusted world itself.\n\n236\n00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:07.050\nThe radius server,\nis at the perimeter of your network, so\n\n237\n00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:11.120\nthat people that are connecting in from\nthe outside, they have to connect here.\n\n238\n00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.170\nAnd then of course, radius is\nactually connected to both networks.\n\n239\n00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.400\n&gt;&gt; So Ronnie,\n&gt;&gt; So we're looking at this diagram,\n\n240\n00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.130\nwe see those would be employees,\nperhaps any kind of vendors,\n\n241\n00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.360\nthat would wanna be connecting to our\nlocal area network there, our resources.\n\n242\n00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.240\nDo we have any kind of security controls,\nwhere we could really specify certain\n\n243\n00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:34.150\nIP addresses and users, that can even\n&gt;&gt; Correspond with that particular\n\n244\n00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.900\ndevice there so that they're not\nreceiving any kind of return message.\n\n245\n00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.640\n&gt;&gt; Well, you can, but at this point\nwe're just talking about authentication.\n\n246\n00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.300\nSo what's going to happen is as\nlong as they have a username and\n\n247\n00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.680\npassword over here and we've allowed\nthem to gain access remotely.\n\n248\n00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.310\nIn other words, we've set that up.\n\n249\n00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:53.100\nThen we really don't add in a bunch\nof the additional things that\n\n250\n00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.320\nCherokee is talking about but you can you\ncan completely do that if you need to.\n\n251\n00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:00.220\nBut let's say that on your\nmachine then you're running that\n\n252\n00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:05.430\nclient that allows you to connect in so\nwhen you first make the connection it's\n\n253\n00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:09.410\nthis particular server right here\nThat says, identify who you are.\n\n254\n00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:13.160\nWell, that's when we actually have\nthat communication back over here.\n\n255\n00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.960\nSo as soon as the client turns on,\nand we make that connection.\n\n256\n00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.850\nThis server says.\n\n257\n00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:22.070\nIf you want to connect in,\nyou've got to prove to me who you are.\n\n258\n00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.120\nSo that is a message that gets sent back.\n\n259\n00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.120\nThen, at that point,\nI provide my username and password.\n\n260\n00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:33.270\nAnd when I send that back\nto this access server here.\n\n261\n00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:37.340\nYou might hear the term remote access\nserver or routing remote access server.\n\n262\n00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.470\nYou might hear the term\nnetwork access server.\n\n263\n00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.340\nThere's a bunch of different names for\nthem.\n\n264\n00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.940\nI just tried to use a generic one here,\nokay?\n\n265\n00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.200\nWhen you do that,\nit's not that the username and\n\n266\n00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.590\npasswords are stored here on this machine.\n\n267\n00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.600\nThat's the key, okay?\n\n268\n00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.370\nThis machine takes a look at it and it\nsays, you're presenting me with username\n\n269\n00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:59.100\nand passwords and that means I\nneed to hand off this information\n\n270\n00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:03.940\nto a centralized authentication\nserver at this point.\n\n271\n00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.120\nNow, the authentication server\nwill take that username and\n\n272\n00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.460\npassword And\nactually do one of two things with it.\n\n273\n00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:12.730\nIt will either be authenticated, and\nthen the authentication, in other words,\n\n274\n00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.390\nwhat they're also allowed to do,\nwe'll go ahead and let them in, or\n\n275\n00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.550\nit will say,\nI don't have that username and\n\n276\n00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:24.620\npassword, I'm not authorizing,\naccess server, do not let the guy in.\n\n277\n00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:30.510\nOkay, so, at this fourth point here If\neverything is good then we connect and\n\n278\n00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:35.830\nnow we're able to gain access to\nthe resources on our network that we need.\n\n279\n00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.960\n&gt;&gt; Now Ronnie, also when we're dealing\nwith that untrusted zone there,\n\n280\n00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.270\npublic network like the internet.\n\n281\n00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.100\nI want to be using a form of encryption.\n\n282\n00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.650\nSo there should be a negotiation\nthat happens, right,\n\n283\n00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:47.770\nwith that particular server.\n\n284\n00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.440\nSo when would that happen?\n\n285\n00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.752\nYeah that would normally happen\neven before this procedure begins\n\n286\n00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:54.753\na lot of times.\n\n287\n00:15:54.753 --> 00:15:59.091\nEven when this remote client here it\nwould probably establish what we call of\n\n288\n00:15:59.091 --> 00:16:02.841\ncourse an encrypted connection\nover the internet at that point.\n\n289\n00:16:02.841 --> 00:16:06.965\nBefore we even do all of this so\nthat none of the traffic can be seen.\n\n290\n00:16:06.965 --> 00:16:10.660\nAnd that actually leads us to\na disadvantage that happens in RADIUS.\n\n291\n00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.260\nAnd you might be wondering,\nwhat is the disadvantage?\n\n292\n00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.040\nWell, nothing is actually sent in\nany encryption at all except for\n\n293\n00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:22.750\nthe password when we provide\nthis particular point here.\n\n294\n00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.050\nIn other words, step number three.\n\n295\n00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:27.850\nThat is the only one of this particular\ncommunication process that is\n\n296\n00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:28.730\nencrypted at all.\n\n297\n00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.090\nYou might wanna know why in\nthe world would they do that?\n\n298\n00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:34.940\nWell you've gotta go back to the days\nwhen it was actually created.\n\n299\n00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.210\nIt was created over a dial up.\n\n300\n00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:40.880\nDial up is a point to point\ncommunication process and\n\n301\n00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.880\nthat means they were only expecting what?\n\n302\n00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.970\nYou to dial in to that server,\n\n303\n00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:49.420\nnobody else would be in on that\ncommunication pathway in between.\n\n304\n00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.920\nSo they didn't think about\nactually needing to encrypt\n\n305\n00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.950\nany other part of the process.\n\n306\n00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.840\nSo everything else that is\nsent in between, the exchange,\n\n307\n00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:57.999\nand the negotiation, and\n\n308\n00:16:57.999 --> 00:17:03.280\nwhatever else is going on there, it was\nall done in plain and clear text here.\n\n309\n00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.100\nSo, it was later on that we realized,\nif we're gonna be doing this across\n\n310\n00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:10.700\nthe Internet, we need to establish\nthat encrypted connection first, and\n\n311\n00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:14.250\nthen we can start that RADIUS process and\ncontinue on from there.\n\n312\n00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:17.840\n&gt;&gt; And, I think, that's why we see RADIUS\nbeing used so much is because it is so\n\n313\n00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.790\nflexible and when you're configuring\nthose encryption parameters and\n\n314\n00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:24.400\nsetting up that RADIUS server, you have\nthe option to select different protocols\n\n315\n00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.090\nthat you can use, eBird,\nMicrosoft Chat, different types of, so\n\n316\n00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:30.850\nyou have a little bit of flexibility\nthere for your environment.\n\n317\n00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:36.080\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, another thing about RADIUS as\nwell is that when you establish this too,\n\n318\n00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:41.150\nbecause of the way that people have\ngotten in over weaknesses and connections\n\n319\n00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:46.170\nover access and authentication, today\nevery user that's authenticated through\n\n320\n00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:51.870\nRADIUS essentially ends up with a unique\nencryption key once access is granted.\n\n321\n00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:53.720\nOkay now that's important, right.\n\n322\n00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:58.440\nSo it's not that everybody has\nthe same encryption key every time.\n\n323\n00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:04.650\nSo that user session essentially now has\na unique encryption key once that happens.\n\n324\n00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:06.030\nSo there are advantages and\n\n325\n00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:10.650\nthere are also disadvantages in terms of\nRADIUS that we need to understand, too.\n\n326\n00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:11.430\nOkay.\n\n327\n00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:15.460\nThe idea here is that once\nwe have this understanding,\n\n328\n00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:20.510\nkey management now is actually easy\nbecause we already turned that over and\n\n329\n00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.990\nit can actually happen in this way, okay?\n\n330\n00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.890\nIf we have, let's say 20 people\ndoing this at the same time,\n\n331\n00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.720\nsimultaneously trying to get\naccess into our network.\n\n332\n00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.680\nWell, and I go,\nI don't want to allow all 20 of them in.\n\n333\n00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.530\nI can simply just deactivate\nthat encryption key.\n\n334\n00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:37.510\nOkay, and\n\n335\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.980\nit means I don't have to cut everybody\nelse off if I want them to come in.\n\n336\n00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.640\nIf I know that that's Cherokee's session,\n\n337\n00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:45.740\nI just simply deactivate her\nencryption key, and guess what?\n\n338\n00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.370\nCherokee can't get in.\n\n339\n00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.800\nSo it gives me very granular and\nvery centralized control\n\n340\n00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.670\nover the connections that\nare actually made in here, okay.\n\n341\n00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:57.590\nThe other thing of course is the idea\nof network permissions are also\n\n342\n00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.590\nuser identity based.\n\n343\n00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:03.000\nBecause everybody, essentially, is an\nindividual session, it really helps out.\n\n344\n00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't wanna just\ngive a blanketed control.\n\n345\n00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.420\n&gt;&gt; Well, remember the earliest and\nthe basic authentication?\n\n346\n00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.580\nIf you got the password,\neverybody was able to gain access in.\n\n347\n00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.596\nBut now, because of what RADIUS does and\n\n348\n00:19:13.596 --> 00:19:15.570\nseparates that out to the username and\npassword.\n\n349\n00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:16.390\n&gt;&gt; And you gotta think about it.\n\n350\n00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:17.480\n&gt;&gt; Now everything's permission based.\n\n351\n00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, those users being remote,\nhow do I know for sure, Ronnie,\n\n352\n00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:21.850\nthat you're Ronnie?\n\n353\n00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:25.750\nSo do I wanna give you full range to all\nof the local area network resources, or\n\n354\n00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:28.330\ndo I wanna say, hey Ronnie,\nwhen you're out in the field,\n\n355\n00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:31.190\nyou're gonna have limited access for\nthis remote connection.\n\n356\n00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.730\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and those are set up through\nthose permissions that we were just\n\n357\n00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.080\ntalking about as well.\n\n358\n00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:39.310\nThe other thing of course is if you choose\nto at some point and you probably will.\n\n359\n00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:45.200\nIf you're going to be implementing\n802.1 or one x authentication as well.\n\n360\n00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.070\nRADIUS goes hand in hand with that.\n\n361\n00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:50.700\nSo it's actually designed to run\nwith that particular authentication,\n\n362\n00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.850\nport based authentication as well.\n\n363\n00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.500\nAnd then the other nice\nadvantage because of the day and\n\n364\n00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.450\nage it was written in,\nit's not resource intensive.\n\n365\n00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:02.770\nSo you don't have to set up\nsomething insanely specialized and\n\n366\n00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:08.130\nhave a ton of extra you know, high\nperformance software and hardware there.\n\n367\n00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:10.450\nYou actually just need\nsomething fairly simple.\n\n368\n00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:13.360\nRADIUS can actually run in\nthe background of most servers and\n\n369\n00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.120\nthat's probably not gonna\nhurt anything at all okay.\n\n370\n00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.190\nThe other advantage today\nbecause it's been around for so\n\n371\n00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:20.410\nlong, it's fairly universal okay.\n\n372\n00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:23.040\nIt's just all out there okay.\n\n373\n00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.910\nEverybody just seems to know and\nthe set up of it is not exactly complex.\n\n374\n00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:29.650\nIt can get complex, don't get me wrong,\n\n375\n00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:33.700\nthe more granular controls that you\nwanna get, the more complex it can get.\n\n376\n00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.620\nAnd if you want to see something like\nthat check out some of the server shows,\n\n377\n00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:42.500\nthe Microsoft server shows where you\ngo into NPS or routing mode access,\n\n378\n00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.800\nthose types of things.\n\n379\n00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.620\nYou'll see it can get a little bit more\ncomplex as you try to get all of those\n\n380\n00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:50.428\npolicies set up to ensure that you have\nthe connection that you need, okay.\n\n381\n00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.370\nNow when it comes down to it\nthere's a few disadvantages too.\n\n382\n00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:59.170\nBecause of the way that triple A works,\nthe authentication, the authorization, and\n\n383\n00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.520\naccounting, those are three\nseparate processes.\n\n384\n00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:09.550\nBut in RADIUS, authentication and\nauthorization are bound together.\n\n385\n00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:13.100\nSo, if you authenticate, you're also\nauthorized to do whatever is needed.\n\n386\n00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.850\nSo this makes it very difficult\nto be able to account for\n\n387\n00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:20.430\neach one separately here to do anything.\n\n388\n00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:24.380\nAlso remember what I also said here\nearlier is that the password itself\n\n389\n00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:28.340\nis the only part of\nthe process that is encrypted.\n\n390\n00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.190\nSo the user name is\nunencrypted during this point.\n\n391\n00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.300\nThe security and\n\n392\n00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:36.660\naccounting information that's actually\nsent back across everything else.\n\n393\n00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.930\nAll that is actually done unencrypted so\n\n394\n00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:43.810\nyou need to provide additional security\nif you're going to be using RADIUS\n\n395\n00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:48.730\nto make this type of remote access or\nremote authentication.\n\n396\n00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:51.742\n&gt;&gt; Like IP stack if you're\nusing an IP network.\n\n397\n00:21:51.742 --> 00:21:54.800\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, any of those additional\nsecurity layers that we have.\n\n398\n00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.850\nIt just has to be provided as well, okay?\n\n399\n00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:01.260\nSo that's actually a great\naspect of using RADIUS and\n\n400\n00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.020\nyou're gonna continue to see it.\n\n401\n00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.530\nWe actually did have a forum\nquestion the other day.\n\n402\n00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.090\nIt said, is anybody still using this?\n\n403\n00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:09.060\nIt's still being used constantly,\n\n404\n00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:13.200\nespecially if we're doing 802.1X\nwith wireless access points.\n\n405\n00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:18.646\nIt's probably one of the most\npopular usages of it at all, okay.\n\n406\n00:22:18.646 --> 00:22:19.818\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and you can even,\n\n407\n00:22:19.818 --> 00:22:23.540\nwith biometrics, integrate biometric\nauthentication with RADIUS.\n\n408\n00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:27.410\nSo multi-factor authentication as well,\nit's still out there.\n\n409\n00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:30.210\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I use username password because\nthat's kind of the simplest and\n\n410\n00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:33.100\ncheapest one and\nthat's who I am is simple and cheap.\n\n411\n00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.348\nSo that's why I do that.\n\n412\n00:22:34.348 --> 00:22:35.604\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n413\n00:22:35.604 --> 00:22:39.240\nno it accepts any type of authentication\nmethod and that's actually a good point.\n\n414\n00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.890\nSo we can use digital certificates,\nwe can do any of that if we want to.\n\n415\n00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:46.170\nSo just kinda realize, it is one of\nthose things that's fairly universal,\n\n416\n00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:47.170\nfairly old.\n\n417\n00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:51.100\nBut really adaptable to most\nclimates that we have today, okay?\n\n418\n00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.533\nNow, with RADIUS though, because of those\nglaring weaknesses that it had, and\n\n419\n00:22:54.533 --> 00:22:56.502\nI actually forgot to\nmention a couple things,\n\n420\n00:22:56.502 --> 00:22:58.940\nthe port numbers is actually\nthe one I forgot to mention.\n\n421\n00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good.\n\n422\n00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:03.255\nWith RADIUS, I know you probably actually\nwould, probably hit this before in\n\n423\n00:23:03.255 --> 00:23:07.590\nSecurity+ and now also in Network+, but\nthe port numbers that you generally see\n\n424\n00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:12.940\nassociated with RADIUS since it is\na protocol is gonna be port 1645, 1646.\n\n425\n00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:18.940\nThat is kind of the most generic version\nof RADIUS in the older ports that you see.\n\n426\n00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.760\nMost newer implementation, especially\nwhen integrating with Microsoft networks,\n\n427\n00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.210\nyou're gonna see 1812 and 1813 as well.\n\n428\n00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:25.820\nOkay.\n\n429\n00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.790\nSo do remember those poor numbers.\n\n430\n00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:29.270\nI know it seems strange, but\n\n431\n00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:33.100\nit's nice to remember that maybe just\neven that little piece of information\n\n432\n00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:36.220\nmight give you a few extra points on\nthe exam as you're getting prepared.\n\n433\n00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.680\nWhen you go, they're never gonna\nask me that and there it is,\n\n434\n00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.031\nthat is that question, I wish I\nwould have paid attention to Ronnie.\n\n435\n00:23:41.031 --> 00:23:42.020\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know, and I always feel like\n\n436\n00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.200\nport numbers are the gimme questions.\n\n437\n00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.520\nThose ones are the easy ones so\nthey don't take too much to think about.\n\n438\n00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.880\nYou just know the numbers and\nthat's it, so.\n\n439\n00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.084\nYeah, and those are correct.\n\n440\n00:23:51.084 --> 00:23:54.912\nAnd you guys can even look at, if you are\nusing a Microsoft environment, check out\n\n441\n00:23:54.912 --> 00:23:58.798\nTechNet and it has those ports listed in\nstep-by-step if you wanted to go ahead and\n\n442\n00:23:58.798 --> 00:23:59.874\nset up a radio server.\n\n443\n00:23:59.874 --> 00:24:02.740\nAnd also like Ronnie said,\nthe shows that we have, too.\n\n444\n00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.933\nAll right, now Cherokee mentioned\nearlier the idea of diameter.\n\n445\n00:24:05.933 --> 00:24:08.451\nBecause there was actually\nan improvement to RADIUS,\n\n446\n00:24:08.451 --> 00:24:11.526\nthey took a look at some of those\nglaring weaknesses that they had.\n\n447\n00:24:11.526 --> 00:24:13.760\nAnd they said,\nhere's how we wanna improve.\n\n448\n00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.140\nBut a really kind of open\nstandard way of doing it, okay?\n\n449\n00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:22.608\nNow, there was another group that\ncame along and said, RADIUS,\n\n450\n00:24:22.608 --> 00:24:25.221\nit has insanely glaring weaknesses.\n\n451\n00:24:25.221 --> 00:24:28.912\nAnd we also wanna improve on it, but\nthis group was called Cisco, [LAUGH] okay?\n\n452\n00:24:28.912 --> 00:24:31.464\nAnd so, what they did is they said look,\nhere it is-\n\n453\n00:24:31.464 --> 00:24:32.743\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] They developed the world's\n\n454\n00:24:32.743 --> 00:24:33.366\nlongest acronym.\n\n455\n00:24:33.366 --> 00:24:34.901\n&gt;&gt; They really did.\n&gt;&gt; Or at least it's in the running for\n\n456\n00:24:34.901 --> 00:24:35.457\nit, I'm sure.\n\n457\n00:24:35.457 --> 00:24:37.347\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's called TACACS+.\n\n458\n00:24:37.347 --> 00:24:42.886\nT-A-C-A-C-S, go figure, and\nthen a plus sign afterwards here.\n\n459\n00:24:42.886 --> 00:24:47.398\n&gt;&gt; Terminal access controller,\naccess control system plus.\n\n460\n00:24:47.398 --> 00:24:49.217\nI just wanted to make sure I\nwasn't leaving anything out.\n\n461\n00:24:49.217 --> 00:24:50.800\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You aren't leaving anything out and\n\n462\n00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.370\nyou could say that three or four times\nin a row, you'd probably get tired.\n\n463\n00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:55.100\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Is what I would assume.\n\n464\n00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.660\nSo this thing does essentially,\nthe function of it,\n\n465\n00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:03.170\nright, is to implement triple A security\njust like what RADIUS does, okay?\n\n466\n00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:07.690\nBut its particular unusual nature\nis that it's not designed to be\n\n467\n00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:09.400\nat the perimeter of the network, okay?\n\n468\n00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.670\nSo everything I showed you in RADIUS,\nTACACS does the same thing.\n\n469\n00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:18.339\nBut the neat thing about TACACS in this\nparticular advantage here is that it can\n\n470\n00:25:18.339 --> 00:25:23.009\nseparate out the difference between\nauthentication and authorization, and\n\n471\n00:25:23.009 --> 00:25:24.297\naccounting, okay?\n\n472\n00:25:24.297 --> 00:25:26.185\nNow, you might wonder,\nwhy is that important?\n\n473\n00:25:26.185 --> 00:25:30.877\nWell, in this instance, depending on\nthe security policy that you have,\n\n474\n00:25:30.877 --> 00:25:34.600\nit allows me to actually put\nthem on separate servers.\n\n475\n00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.590\nSo if I wanted to, I could run\nan authentication server and I could run\n\n476\n00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:44.160\na separate authorization server,\nI could run a separate accounting server.\n\n477\n00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.088\nSo that what happens is as you bounced in,\nyou get authenticated, but\n\n478\n00:25:47.088 --> 00:25:49.631\nthat doesn't mean that you're\nauthorized to do anything.\n\n479\n00:25:49.631 --> 00:25:51.899\nIt bounces the message out back to you,\nand\n\n480\n00:25:51.899 --> 00:25:54.610\nthen it comes back into\nthe authorization server.\n\n481\n00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:58.838\nAnd then comes back and also registers\neverything with the accounting server, so\n\n482\n00:25:58.838 --> 00:25:59.389\nthat way,\n\n483\n00:25:59.389 --> 00:26:03.590\na failure of one of those servers\ndoesn't bring down everything else.\n\n484\n00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:06.210\n&gt;&gt; So, Ronnie, aside from the security\nfeatures that you mentioned,\n\n485\n00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:10.590\nwhat would be another reason why I\nwould choose TACACS+ over RADIUS?\n\n486\n00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:13.480\n&gt;&gt; Well,\nthe big advantage of TACACS+ is really\n\n487\n00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.480\na big advantage if you're running Cisco.\n\n488\n00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.130\nThat's pretty much the really\nbig advantage here.\n\n489\n00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:23.420\nIt really was, at the very beginning,\nwith TACACS+, Cisco proprietary.\n\n490\n00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.950\nAnd you probably said, well,\nwhy would you choose to do that, then?\n\n491\n00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.640\nBecause it was better in\nterms of the features.\n\n492\n00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.320\nAnd some of the things that\nwe just mentioned, as well.\n\n493\n00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.990\nBut overall, though,\nthat was this big limitation, too.\n\n494\n00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:38.370\nSo its biggest advantage is\nalso its biggest feature.\n\n495\n00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:43.220\nIf you already had established all Cisco\nequipment, then TACACS was the way to go.\n\n496\n00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:48.050\nNow, even though you hear\nabout the idea of TACACS+ and\n\n497\n00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:52.480\nwe can mention that there's actually an\noriginal TACACS out there, but it really\n\n498\n00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.118\nisn't directly compatible when you talk\nabout the earliest implementations.\n\n499\n00:26:56.118 --> 00:27:01.101\nEven though TACACS is no longer supported\nat the end of the lifetime of where\n\n500\n00:27:01.101 --> 00:27:06.322\nTACACS was, it still used port 49,\nwhich meant it was still trying to become\n\n501\n00:27:06.322 --> 00:27:11.170\nthe idea of being backward compatible and\nthe latest ones really could.\n\n502\n00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:13.410\nYou could switch them in if you wanted to.\n\n503\n00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.290\nBut the limitation of\n\n504\n00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:20.420\nbeing Cisco proprietary was kind of\nits biggest disadvantage as well.\n\n505\n00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:25.110\nDon't forget, the other advantage\nof it is that in that day when\n\n506\n00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:29.730\nRADIUS was really at its heyday, okay,\nit only supported IP based networks.\n\n507\n00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:33.820\nToday, though, it probably just\nsupports IP networks as well and\n\n508\n00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.760\nyou might be wondering,\nwell, why is that great?\n\n509\n00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.060\nIt's great because it's the only\nnetwork that's still around.\n\n510\n00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.780\nBut TACACS, though,\nin the day when it came out,\n\n511\n00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:45.750\nit supported a ton of different ones, such\nas Apple Talk, the Netbox Frame Control,\n\n512\n00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:47.120\nI wanna make sure I say these right.\n\n513\n00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.940\nNovell Asynchronous Services Interface.\n\n514\n00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:54.632\nAnd then X.25 PAD, or\nPAD types of connections.\n\n515\n00:27:54.632 --> 00:27:58.580\nAnd this is actually very important for\nthem, because they wanted to be so\n\n516\n00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:01.127\nuniversal that,\nregardless of what network,\n\n517\n00:28:01.127 --> 00:28:03.302\nthey weren't gonna make you choose IP.\n\n518\n00:28:03.302 --> 00:28:05.863\nBecause they didn't know the direction\nthat the world was going,\n\n519\n00:28:05.863 --> 00:28:08.800\ncuz there were so many different\nindependent protocols out there.\n\n520\n00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.150\nThey were supporting everything.\n\n521\n00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:16.020\nIf you were in that situation in which\nyour network was different, you might've\n\n522\n00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:21.500\nactually chosen this one since RADIUS only\nworked with IP networks instead, okay?\n\n523\n00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:26.130\nNow the other thing about this is\nit really doesn't support 802.1x.\n\n524\n00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:29.270\nSo that could be considered\na disadvantage as well.\n\n525\n00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:32.450\nAnd is not recommended like I said,\nfor remote access.\n\n526\n00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:37.250\nIt's great inside of an internal\nnetwork but not on the perimeter too.\n\n527\n00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:45.170\nAnd even way back in 1993, they finally\nrealized, look, nobody is really using it.\n\n528\n00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:47.160\nOne, it was very expensive to implement,\n\n529\n00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.960\nbecause you had to buy their\nparticular TACACS server.\n\n530\n00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.913\nAAA server, unlike RADIUS,\nit wasn't open source, and\n\n531\n00:28:53.913 --> 00:28:57.707\nso it was built to specifications, and\nthe software that they used had to do\n\n532\n00:28:57.707 --> 00:29:00.252\neverything that they needed\nto do which was fine.\n\n533\n00:29:00.252 --> 00:29:05.273\nBut overall, though, when you had a system\nlike this and nobody was really using it,\n\n534\n00:29:05.273 --> 00:29:10.019\nexcept for people that Cisco equipment,\nthen they decided to release the actual\n\n535\n00:29:10.019 --> 00:29:13.819\nTACACS Standard itself as\nan open standard, back in 1993.\n\n536\n00:29:13.819 --> 00:29:15.490\nSo they just gave it away.\n\n537\n00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:20.430\nBecause it was like, well, there's no use\nof us having this and the only way to\n\n538\n00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:23.910\nget any type of popularity is to see\nif we can put it as open standards.\n\n539\n00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:26.520\nBut by that point, the world had moved on.\n\n540\n00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.970\nIt's really kind of a shame\ncuz fairly decent and\n\n541\n00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:32.360\na bit more secure than the idea of RADIUS.\n\n542\n00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:37.146\nIf you think about TACACS+ and DIAMETER\ntrying to improve on basic RADIUS,\n\n543\n00:29:37.146 --> 00:29:40.137\nboth of those,\neven though they might actually\n\n544\n00:29:40.137 --> 00:29:44.791\nhave given us better functional\nimprovements, never really caught on.\n\n545\n00:29:44.791 --> 00:29:48.858\nAnd that's because, well, RADIUS itself\nhas been the standard all the way through\n\n546\n00:29:48.858 --> 00:29:53.010\nthis point in time with IP networks, and\nIP is the only one that's out there.\n\n547\n00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:54.630\nAnd everybody just tends to go,\n\n548\n00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:59.200\nwhy not use the one that's worked all\nthe time throughout time instead?\n\n549\n00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.050\nSo that's where we are today in terms of\n\n550\n00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:06.470\ntaking just a couple of these different\ntypes of authentication services too.\n\n551\n00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:09.280\n&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Ronnie, for\nexplaining some of the evolution of\n\n552\n00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.210\na couple different types\nof authentication services.\n\n553\n00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.640\nAnd thank you guys for tuning in.\n\n554\n00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.700\nWe do have more authentication services.\n\n555\n00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.110\nWe have to continue on our\nchronological journey here.\n\n556\n00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.320\nDifferent types that we\nhave available to us.\n\n557\n00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.880\nSo stay tuned for that.\n\n558\n00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.340\nMake sure you don't go anywhere.\n\n559\n00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.760\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n560\n00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.560\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Ronnie Wong.\n\n561\n00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.883\n&gt;&gt; See you next time here at IT Pro TV.\n\n562\n00:30:30.883 -->

[CROSSTALK]\n\n3\n00:00:06.305 --> 00:00:08.334\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.334 --> 00:00:12.504\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.504 --> 00:00:15.372\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another CompTIA Security+,\nepisode.\n\n6\n00:00:15.372 --> 00:00:17.752\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n7\n00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:22.261\nThis episode is a continuation of\na previous episode, where we were looking\n\n8\n00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:26.006\nat comparing, different types\nof authentication services.\n\n9\n00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:29.794\nWe were able to go ahead, and\ntake a look at RADIUS and TACACS+.\n\n10\n00:00:29.794 --> 00:00:32.290\nBut we're gonna go ahead and\npick up in this episode.\n\n11\n00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.600\nAnd with us today, we have Mr Ronnie Wong.\n\n12\n00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.095\nThank you for being with us today, Ronnie.\n\n13\n00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:38.705\nWell, and thank you for\nhaving me back on the show,\n\n14\n00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.459\nas we continue on with some\nmore CompTIA Security+.\n\n15\n00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:45.208\nWe wanna take a look at some other\ntypes of authentication methods,\n\n16\n00:00:45.208 --> 00:00:47.662\nthat you're probably going to encounter.\n\n17\n00:00:47.662 --> 00:00:52.040\nWe've already talked about,\nlike Cherokee said, the idea of RADIUS,\n\n18\n00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.715\nas well as, of course, the TACACS+ here.\n\n19\n00:00:54.715 --> 00:00:58.336\nAnd now we're moving on to, well,\nsomething a little bit more advanced,\n\n20\n00:00:58.336 --> 00:00:59.612\nthat we call, Kerberos.\n\n21\n00:00:59.612 --> 00:01:03.260\nYou might hear the term Kerberos,\nyou name it.\n\n22\n00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.200\nI don't know exactly how it's\nsupposed to be pronounced, but\n\n23\n00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.140\nthis is an authentication method\nthat was really designed,\n\n24\n00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.880\nI think if I remember right, at MIT.\n\n25\n00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.670\nAnd they named it after\na three-headed Greek mythological dog,\n\n26\n00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.090\nthat guards the gates of Hades,\nis what they've actually done here.\n\n27\n00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.880\nTo try and say,\n\n28\n00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.060\nhey, here's how the authentication method\nworks, because that involves three parts.\n\n29\n00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.460\nNow, the key and\nthe goal behind this though,\n\n30\n00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.770\nis not much that it involves\nthree separate components.\n\n31\n00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.440\nThe key and goal behind this, is something\nthat we call SSO or single sign on.\n\n32\n00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.036\nIs really the ultimate goal behind,\nwhat this system does.\n\n33\n00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:48.491\nWhat we've had access to,\nbefore a lot of times is fairly simple.\n\n34\n00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:51.882\nIs that every resource on our\nnetwork essentially meant,\n\n35\n00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:54.384\nthat you also needed a separate password.\n\n36\n00:01:54.384 --> 00:01:56.655\nOr even separate user name and\npassword, for\n\n37\n00:01:56.655 --> 00:01:59.440\nevery one of those different resources.\n\n38\n00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.960\nSo let's take for an example,\nyou had five servers.\n\n39\n00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.600\nWell, that means with those\nfive different servers,\n\n40\n00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.080\nyou'd need a separate username and\npassword, for that one.\n\n41\n00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.310\nAnd then you'd go, I need to also get\naccess to server number two, over here.\n\n42\n00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.300\nThen you'd have to go and\nenter in another one, for that one and\n\n43\n00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.800\nthe server number three.\n\n44\n00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.360\nYou name it.\n\n45\n00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.060\nIt actually became almost unmanageable,\nfor most users.\n\n46\n00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.234\nThat we're now keeping 10,\n15 different passwords, so\n\n47\n00:02:22.234 --> 00:02:24.990\nthat it could access 10 or\n15 different systems.\n\n48\n00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.184\nKerberos said, what if we could\nimplement a method though.\n\n49\n00:02:28.184 --> 00:02:32.997\nThat allows you, instead,\nto have a single sign on.\n\n50\n00:02:32.997 --> 00:02:34.105\nAnd from that point,\n\n51\n00:02:34.105 --> 00:02:38.460\nhave the control to be able to gain\naccess to each one of those resources.\n\n52\n00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.590\nOnce you actually have signed on.\n\n53\n00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.390\nAnd that is really where the power and\nthe magic of Kerberos, really begins.\n\n54\n00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.050\n&gt;&gt; We also have to think about, look.\n\n55\n00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.098\nThis is definitely undoubtedly,\na more convenient way of authenticating.\n\n56\n00:02:52.098 --> 00:02:55.555\nBut wouldn't it be just as convenient for\nthat attacker, to go ahead and\n\n57\n00:02:55.555 --> 00:02:56.885\ncompromise the system.\n\n58\n00:02:56.885 --> 00:03:00.985\nSo, you really need to take care of\nyour password, and not share that out.\n\n59\n00:03:00.985 --> 00:03:03.895\nAnd make sure you're following your\ncompany policy, whenever it comes\n\n60\n00:03:03.895 --> 00:03:07.965\nto their password policy, for\nthis single sign-on environment.\n\n61\n00:03:07.965 --> 00:03:12.310\n&gt;&gt; There's no doubt that it really is,\nabout that whole complete idea.\n\n62\n00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.400\nBut how it actually happens,\n\n63\n00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.640\nlet's get back to that three\nheaded dog here, for a moment.\n\n64\n00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.810\nIs that,\nthere are three components involved, and\n\n65\n00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.680\nthey are important components.\n\n66\n00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.460\nBut at the same time, its purpose is\na key, the idea of single sign-on.\n\n67\n00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.890\nSo when we start talking about those,\nparticular components there.\n\n68\n00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.340\nYou have the client itself, the one\nthat is trying to of course sign on.\n\n69\n00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.390\nThen we have what we call,\na Kerberos server.\n\n70\n00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.183\nOr a key distribution center, a KDC,\n\n71\n00:03:39.183 --> 00:03:41.768\nwhatever you want to call it here,\nis perfectly fine.\n\n72\n00:03:41.768 --> 00:03:45.194\nIt's a server that, essentially, says,\nwe're gonna do this methodology.\n\n73\n00:03:45.194 --> 00:03:48.669\nAnd then, that resource server,\nwherever you're trying to access.\n\n74\n00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.821\nAll of those are actually\ninvolved in this process, but\n\n75\n00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:54.712\nhow are they involved in this process,\nis the key.\n\n76\n00:03:54.712 --> 00:04:00.111\nSo before we kind of, we're not gonna go\nsuper technical into the explanation here.\n\n77\n00:04:00.111 --> 00:04:04.031\nBut let's at least give an analogy,\nthat I think works well.\n\n78\n00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:07.968\nThat I think will help you to understand,\nthe process of Kerberos instead.\n\n79\n00:04:07.968 --> 00:04:10.555\nSo, Cherokee,\nhave you gone to see a movie recently?\n\n80\n00:04:10.555 --> 00:04:11.779\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I have.\n\n81\n00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:15.585\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\nsince you've gone to see a movie recently.\n\n82\n00:04:15.585 --> 00:04:19.471\nDid you buy the tickets online,\nor did you go to the box office?\n\n83\n00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:20.770\n&gt;&gt; So this is kinda interesting.\n\n84\n00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.430\nI went there to watch the movie.\n\n85\n00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.970\nI wanted to buy the ticket,\nbut they were sold out.\n\n86\n00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.000\nSo I had to buy a ticket for a later time.\n\n87\n00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.391\nYeah.\nSo I purchased it, at the theater.\n\n88\n00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:33.351\nBut from the box office,\nwithin the theater.\n\n89\n00:04:33.351 --> 00:04:34.190\n&gt;&gt; Excellent.\n\n90\n00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.424\nThat's actually kind of\nthe analogy I wanted to use here,\n\n91\n00:04:37.424 --> 00:04:41.490\nis to understand the working of\nhow Kerberos, actually works.\n\n92\n00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.035\nThe analogy, is fairly simple.\n\n93\n00:04:43.035 --> 00:04:46.586\nLet's take,\nat least a portion of what Cherokee said.\n\n94\n00:04:46.586 --> 00:04:49.900\nAnd then we're gonna actually transfer it,\nto maybe a little more complex here.\n\n95\n00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.460\nSo let's take a look at my screen and\nI think,\n\n96\n00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.240\nthis will help us out\njust a little bit here.\n\n97\n00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.500\nSo let's, we'll kind of add in\nthe technical elements in a moment.\n\n98\n00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.420\nBut let's say that over here at the,\n\n99\n00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.890\nsee if I can do this one without\ngetting us all sick here.\n\n100\n00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:04.520\n&gt;&gt; There you are.\n\n101\n00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n102\n00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.240\n&gt;&gt; So here it is, yes.\n\n103\n00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.050\nThis is my drawing,\nyou can tell that I'm not exactly great,\n\n104\n00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.120\nat trying to do this with\n&gt;&gt; Pretty good.\n\n105\n00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.190\n&gt;&gt; An actual track pad here.\n\n106\n00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.100\nNow, when we start to get access.\n\n107\n00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.830\nThe client is pretty much,\nthe most important part here.\n\n108\n00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.075\nSo this is representing someone,\nthat wants to go and see a movie.\n\n109\n00:05:24.075 --> 00:05:27.260\nAnd they go to the box office himself, and\n\n110\n00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.490\nthis is where the client says,\nI need a ticket.\n\n111\n00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.970\nNow, this particular ticket in\nthe realm of Kerberos, at this point.\n\n112\n00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.180\nIs what's called a TGT or a ticket\ngranting ticket, that's what it's called.\n\n113\n00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.380\nNow, of course before that's issued,\nthis particular server then,\n\n114\n00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.960\nneeds to actually verify\nthe identification.\n\n115\n00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.950\nOnce that's verified,\nthen he hands a ticket,\n\n116\n00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.060\ngranting ticket of course to the user,\nassigns that to the user.\n\n117\n00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.201\nAnd once that's actually\nbeen assigned to the user.\n\n118\n00:05:59.201 --> 00:06:02.179\nThen, it used to be and I don't know if\nit's this way anymore, cuz it's been so\n\n119\n00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:03.922\nlong since I've actually\ngone to see a movie.\n\n120\n00:06:03.922 --> 00:06:06.227\n&gt;&gt; That's how it was for us, last weekend.\n\n121\n00:06:06.227 --> 00:06:08.680\n&gt;&gt; So once you have that.\n\n122\n00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.450\nThen a lot of times,\n\n123\n00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.020\nespecially when it's busy at those\ntheaters, you normally have somebody else.\n\n124\n00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.605\nAn usher standing after the box office,\nwhen you go in the side door.\n\n125\n00:06:18.605 --> 00:06:20.567\nAnd they might actually just ask you for\nwhat,\n\n126\n00:06:20.567 --> 00:06:23.552\neven though they might be standing\n15 feet away from the box office.\n\n127\n00:06:23.552 --> 00:06:27.770\nThey might ask you to go ahead and\nsign, or show them that ticket.\n\n128\n00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.550\nSo, they ask you for the ticket,\nand they look at the ticket, and\n\n129\n00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.140\nthey're looking for certain pieces\nof information on that ticket.\n\n130\n00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.070\nSo, Cherokee, I'm assuming that they\nsaid what movie you're gonna see, and\n\n131\n00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.560\nwhat theater it's in, right?\n\n132\n00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.840\n&gt;&gt; Exactly\n&gt;&gt; And also,\n\n133\n00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.270\nif you took a look at the ticket itself,\n\n134\n00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.370\nCherokee, did you see the timestamp,\nthat the movie was showing?\n\n135\n00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.890\n&gt;&gt; As a matter of fact,\nit did have a timestamp.\n\n136\n00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:54.290\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it has that information\non it and this is very key, for\n\n137\n00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.830\nthe person who is actually here.\n\n138\n00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.550\nNow, this is still part of\nthe Kerberos server itself or.\n\n139\n00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.830\nPart of that system at this point.\n\n140\n00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.750\nAnd what it's doing is it's\ninspecting to say hey,\n\n141\n00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.590\nis this ticket really from\nmy key distributions.\n\n142\n00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.010\nDoes this come from\nthe system that I know.\n\n143\n00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.420\nAnd if it does, that's fine.\n\n144\n00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.040\nCuz it's looking for things like,\nhey is this your ticket?\n\n145\n00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.190\nWhat time was it issued?\n\n146\n00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.271\nWhere are you trying to get access to?\n\n147\n00:07:21.271 --> 00:07:23.252\nWhat's actually going on here?\n\n148\n00:07:23.252 --> 00:07:26.230\nSo now, what you actually have is simple.\n\n149\n00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.975\nSo if everything matches up,\nwhen they showed us.\n\n150\n00:07:28.975 --> 00:07:32.840\nThen they'll tell you exactly,\nlike hey, you can get there, so\n\n151\n00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.630\nhere I have, you're in 40, theater 43.\n\n152\n00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.475\nCuz everything's, a super megaplex now.\n\n153\n00:07:36.475 --> 00:07:39.660\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For the matinee showing in 5 minutes,\n\n154\n00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.710\nyou got 5 minutes to run down this\nhallway, to theater number 43 there.\n\n155\n00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.250\nAnd then, you can gain access in.\n\n156\n00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.550\nNow what does this person do?\n\n157\n00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.150\nWell, they normally have\na ticket box near them.\n\n158\n00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.180\nAnd they take your ticket and\nthey do what, they tear it?\n\n159\n00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.310\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; They tore it?\n\n160\n00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.950\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And they gave you back part of it?\n\n161\n00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:55.971\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And then they kept part of it?\n\n162\n00:07:55.971 --> 00:07:57.852\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, that makes sense.\n\n163\n00:07:57.852 --> 00:08:00.671\nSo they inspected it, they actually\nsaid that what, this ticket is good,\n\n164\n00:08:00.671 --> 00:08:01.860\nit's valid.\n\n165\n00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.849\nHead on down to theater number 43.\n\n166\n00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:05.555\n&gt;&gt; The only thing you didn't say, Ronnie,\n\n167\n00:08:05.555 --> 00:08:07.810\nwas that I had to make it\nthere by that particular time.\n\n168\n00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.444\nWhy are you calling out that five minutes?\n\n169\n00:08:09.444 --> 00:08:13.129\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's actually a very good point\nand we're gonna see this in a moment here.\n\n170\n00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:14.170\nOkay?\n&gt;&gt; Okay, good, good.\n\n171\n00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.880\n&gt;&gt; So, now, let's say that, and\n\n172\n00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.280\nthat's why I actually put that\ntime limit in there as well.\n\n173\n00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.242\nOkay, so here, right before and it could\nbe really busy at this point, right.\n\n174\n00:08:23.242 --> 00:08:26.129\nBut lets say that this is\nthe latest showing of whatever or\n\n175\n00:08:26.129 --> 00:08:29.797\nthe latest movie was and we can even\nimagine this if you're a Star Wars fan\n\n176\n00:08:29.797 --> 00:08:31.560\nthat the newest Star Wars movie\n&gt;&gt; Yeah\n\n177\n00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.300\n&gt;&gt; will be out in just a few weeks.\n\n178\n00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.870\nThey're gonna bust through the doors.\n\n179\n00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.445\nThey might even have another\nperson there at that point.\n\n180\n00:08:37.445 --> 00:08:41.305\nAt the entry way to that\ntheater to verify that,\n\n181\n00:08:41.305 --> 00:08:45.658\nCherokee you didn't buy a ticket for\nwhatever it is.\n\n182\n00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:47.484\n&gt;&gt; Theater hopping.\n\n183\n00:08:47.484 --> 00:08:48.890\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, theater hopping.\n\n184\n00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:49.540\nThat's a good term.\n\n185\n00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.663\nI didn't even know what it's called here.\n\n186\n00:08:50.663 --> 00:08:51.760\n&gt;&gt; I just made it up.\n\n187\n00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.037\n&gt;&gt; You didn't buy a ticket for\n\n188\n00:08:54.037 --> 00:08:59.890\nthe fifth showing of some British\nmovie that nobody wants to see.\n\n189\n00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:02.090\nAnd then say,\nI'm just gonna walk over here.\n\n190\n00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.880\nSo at this point you have that, okay.\n\n191\n00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.660\nYou have that person that then says,\nall right I need to do what?\n\n192\n00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.760\nI need to see your ticket stub, okay.\n\n193\n00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.440\nSo let's take a look at my drawing again,\nand that particular point here.\n\n194\n00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.030\nWhat you are actually given back at the,\n\n195\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.480\nwhere the person had the ticket box,\nright?\n\n196\n00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.780\nYou're given back this,\nwhich is that ticket graining service.\n\n197\n00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.860\nIt's essentially a token,\nthat says yep, here's my ticket so\n\n198\n00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.160\nI can get into this theater here,\nand so there you go, okay.\n\n199\n00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.680\nSo now you actually have to see this.\n\n200\n00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.770\nNow, this person two is supposed\nto also see something, okay.\n\n201\n00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.230\nAnd in either one of\nthese two places here.\n\n202\n00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.950\nIf it's within five minutes\n\n203\n00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:43.680\nof when the time it was issued\nat the box office, okay.\n\n204\n00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.260\nWell now they look at it and\n\n205\n00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.220\nwhat they actually see is that Cherokee\ndidn't buy the matinee ticket.\n\n206\n00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.840\nBut she bought the one for the later\ntime and this is supposed to be for\n\n207\n00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.140\nthe matinee showing.\n\n208\n00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:57.030\nThey're supposed to look and go,\nthey must not have caught it up front, but\n\n209\n00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.930\nthis is for a later showing.\n\n210\n00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.180\nAnd every single seat's already\nbeen sold out for the matinee, so\n\n211\n00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.100\nI need to hold you back.\n\n212\n00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.810\nYou can't go in.\n\n213\n00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.600\nYou can go in at your later time and\nthat's fine, okay?\n\n214\n00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.360\nIt also prevents someone from doing\nthis which is taking this ticket stub.\n\n215\n00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.010\nLet's say that, what they did before they\nwent and bought the ticket stub, as a guy\n\n216\n00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.640\nwas leaving the theater, somebody dropped\ntheir ticket stub out of their pocket.\n\n217\n00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.040\nMy gosh there's a stub for that movie and\nI just saw it, and that they try and\n\n218\n00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.910\npresent this as,\nI just bought this back here.\n\n219\n00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.656\nAnd they're like no,\nthe time stamp was for this morning-\n\n220\n00:10:25.656 --> 00:10:26.179\n&gt;&gt; Invalid yeah.\n\n221\n00:10:26.179 --> 00:10:27.590\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's invalid.\n\n222\n00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.530\nSo it actually prevents\nthem from going in.\n\n223\n00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.550\nSo once everything is actually grant here,\n\n224\n00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:34.180\nthen you gain access\ninto the theater itself.\n\n225\n00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.020\n&gt;&gt; So by theater,\n\n226\n00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.930\nyou mean the actual network resource\nthat you're really trying to access.\n\n227\n00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.540\nAnd I can only imagine\nthat with this time,\n\n228\n00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:47.080\nthis five minute time frame, it's pretty\nessential to have all of our systems\n\n229\n00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.840\nsynced up to the same time\nwithin our network right?\n\n230\n00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.550\n&gt;&gt; It really is.\n\n231\n00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:54.040\nIt's very essential that everything\nis actually synced in time and\n\n232\n00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.160\nthat we have everything in place here so-\n&gt;&gt; Time zones as well.\n\n233\n00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.440\nOtherwise that authentication\nis going to fail.\n\n234\n00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah there's a couple things.\n\n235\n00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.920\nSo let me add back in some\nof the technical elements so\n\n236\n00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.580\nthat we can see this a little bit more on\nthis side of things to help us out, okay?\n\n237\n00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.990\nSo, when we talk about the idea\nof Key Distribution Center for\n\n238\n00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.990\nKerberos, even though I have\nit as two separate parts,\n\n239\n00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.700\nyou may see it as actually\nbeing one server.\n\n240\n00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.853\nSo they may be the one that actually\nissues that ticket-granting ticket.\n\n241\n00:11:20.853 --> 00:11:24.360\nAnd then, you have to present\nit back to them, again.\n\n242\n00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.020\nSo that's why I split off KDC\ninto two separate components, so\n\n243\n00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.130\neven though you might\nsee them as one server.\n\n244\n00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.420\nThen, once they actually say hey,\nthat's the right ticket,\n\n245\n00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.330\nthey give you that ticket\ngranting service at that point.\n\n246\n00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.240\nAnd then that's when you gain access\nto the network service over here.\n\n247\n00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:45.120\nSo anywhere along the point here, this\nactually helps you with single sign on,\n\n248\n00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.790\nbecause as long as your\nparticular ticket is valid,\n\n249\n00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.210\nthat means you can gain access there.\n\n250\n00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.450\nNow the other thing though\nis if it's invalid,\n\n251\n00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.120\nit doesn't mean you can't get back in.\n\n252\n00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.890\nIt just means you simply have\nto go back to the box office.\n\n253\n00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:01.380\nAnd get another ticket or back to\nthe KDC and get another ticket as well.\n\n254\n00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.410\nSo that's really kinda the point\nthat we needed to make and\n\n255\n00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.590\nunderstand about the idea of Kerberos.\n\n256\n00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.440\nWe see it used more often today,\n\n257\n00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.390\nespecially with network directories\nlike Microsoft Active Directory\n\n258\n00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:17.570\nbecause it does prevent us from\nhaving to keep multiple passwords.\n\n259\n00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.590\nAnd we can actually just\nuse our single sign on.\n\n260\n00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:23.810\nAnd then resources are then\nlimiting our access by using\n\n261\n00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:26.130\npermissions instead on every single one.\n\n262\n00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.600\nAnd all that's tied to that\nticket granting service.\n\n263\n00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.240\nSo it is a very effective way\nthat we can actually have\n\n264\n00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.430\nthe authentication that we need.\n\n265\n00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.090\nAnd it's probably one of the more\npopular things that's implemented.\n\n266\n00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.770\nGreat thing is once you implement\nthings like Active Directory,\n\n267\n00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:40.090\nit's only done in the background.\n\n268\n00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.910\nWe don't have to really tweak very much,\n\n269\n00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:47.380\nor actually configure a lot in terms of\nKerberos working the way that we need to.\n\n270\n00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.340\nSo just remember that\nthat's another method, and\n\n271\n00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.580\nprobably a very likely method inside of an\nActive Directory type of network as well.\n\n272\n00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.120\nSo Ronnie, you mentioned Active Directory.\n\n273\n00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.932\nThat's one of the most common types of\ndirectory services available to us.\n\n274\n00:12:58.932 --> 00:13:04.530\nBut what is the underpinning protocol that\nallows Active Directory to even work?\n\n275\n00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's actually something\nthat we call LDAP here, okay?\n\n276\n00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.980\nAnd LDAP, I think, if I remember right,\nworked on port 389,\n\n277\n00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.030\nif I remember correctly here.\n\n278\n00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.750\nSo lightweight directory access protocol,\n\n279\n00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:20.400\nokay, is initially meant to help us\nto essentially do that same idea,\n\n280\n00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:25.270\nwhere we're authenticating against\na centralized type of directory here.\n\n281\n00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:29.540\nAnd it's really meant to be done in the\nbackground for a lot of different things.\n\n282\n00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.810\nBut its primary method is\nthe idea of access control.\n\n283\n00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:38.000\nSo, when we combine the idea of\nusing Kerberos with the LDAP\n\n284\n00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.940\nservice all together and even a few other\nthings, we get Microsoft Active Directory.\n\n285\n00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.040\nBut there are other services\nthat are out there for\n\n286\n00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.780\nLinux that really base themselves\naround an LDAP directory and\n\n287\n00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.830\njust about-\n&gt;&gt; Novell, you name it.\n\n288\n00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:53.520\n&gt;&gt; Novell, Linux, whatever their\ndirectory service is gonna be.\n\n289\n00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.370\nYou name it.\nThere's actually several different ones.\n\n290\n00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:59.450\nNow, the strange thing about LDAP, right,\nis that when you first initially connect\n\n291\n00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:03.707\nin to do something, you have to\nauthenticate to the service itself, okay.\n\n292\n00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.500\nFirst, when it actually initially runs,\nand then at that point,\n\n293\n00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.800\nthen the server will allow you at\nthat point to create a binding.\n\n294\n00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.860\nSo that's what they call it.\n\n295\n00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:17.620\nA binding of some sort, as such your\ncredentials are actually bound to\n\n296\n00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:22.240\nthis particular type of authorization and\nyou move through the system, okay.\n\n297\n00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.660\nAnd there's multiple types of or three\ntypes of what they call authentication\n\n298\n00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.520\nbinding that will give you\nthe access that you want as well.\n\n299\n00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.530\nSo the idea that there's actually\nan anonymous way that you can do this.\n\n300\n00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:35.770\nMost of the time that's not\ngonna be implemented much for\n\n301\n00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.160\nanything that we want.\n\n302\n00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.775\nThere's also a simple method in which you\nsend what we call the distinguished name,\n\n303\n00:14:41.775 --> 00:14:46.460\nokay, of the client and the password\nall done in plain text as well.\n\n304\n00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:50.170\nSo if that's actually something that\nyou want, not really LDAP is the key.\n\n305\n00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:51.010\nBut if you're gonna do that,\n\n306\n00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:54.330\nthat means you wanna send it over\nwhat we call secure LDAP instead.\n\n307\n00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:56.100\nAnd that's really the only difference.\n\n308\n00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.000\nAnd even though it's listed as\nan exam objective separately,\n\n309\n00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.820\nthat's really the only key difference\nbetween LDAP that's secured and\n\n310\n00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:06.100\nLDAP that's the way that we're talking\nabout, is that it's actually securing.\n\n311\n00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.570\nThere's also simple authentications\nsecurity layer or SASL.\n\n312\n00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:11.770\nA lot of times you'll\nalso hear that as well.\n\n313\n00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:15.310\nAnd this is actually done to establish\nsecured communication between\n\n314\n00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.540\nthe resource as well as that to\ntheir client that's connecting in.\n\n315\n00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.890\nBut the nice thing is LDAP essentially\nallows you to do whatever authentication\n\n316\n00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:28.470\nthat you want to, as long as that\nsystem is setup to support it.\n\n317\n00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:32.460\nSo, that underlying protocol\nis essentially important, and\n\n318\n00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.390\nit is one of the ways that we can\ndo it if we're not talking about\n\n319\n00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.150\nusing Microsoft Active Directory.\n\n320\n00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.920\nMore than likely,\nyou're talking about LDAP.\n\n321\n00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.500\nAnd it really does about the same\nthing in terms of functionality.\n\n322\n00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.630\nSo just kind of be aware of that one too,\nokay.\n\n323\n00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:51.127\nNow, the other one that we also have\nis an extended version, of course,\n\n324\n00:15:51.127 --> 00:15:52.836\nof TACACS called XTACACS.\n\n325\n00:15:52.836 --> 00:15:56.335\nAnd this one is actually\ndesigned not to replace or\n\n326\n00:15:56.335 --> 00:15:59.670\nactually designed before I should say.\n\n327\n00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:03.534\nDesigned before TACACS Plus was by\nthe open standard that was there.\n\n328\n00:16:03.534 --> 00:16:06.416\nTo try and\nextend the lifetime of the original one.\n\n329\n00:16:06.416 --> 00:16:09.310\nWell, TACACS+ didn't work out very well.\n\n330\n00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:13.010\nXTACACS, extended TACACS\ndidn't work out any better,\n\n331\n00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.400\neven though they thought it would.\n\n332\n00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:19.910\nBut pretty much, RADIUS has succeeded both\nof them in terms of what they wanted.\n\n333\n00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:24.260\nNow, the original extended\nTACACS was kind of the Cisco\n\n334\n00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:28.310\nversion point one of TACACS Plus.\n\n335\n00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.330\nThey thought that they knew exactly what\nthey wanted, and implemented it, and\n\n336\n00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.310\nit didn't work as well as they wanted to.\n\n337\n00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:34.855\nSo they added in some\nmore advanced features,\n\n338\n00:16:34.855 --> 00:16:38.880\nbecause it wasn't differentiated enough\nfrom Radius, so they actually did that.\n\n339\n00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.860\nAnd you don't tend to see the idea of X,\nTAC X, too often any place.\n\n340\n00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:48.480\nThis particular version was\nabsolutely not compatible, or\n\n341\n00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.832\nbackward compatible with the original.\n\n342\n00:16:50.832 --> 00:16:55.660\nSo you probably won't see that, but it is\nlisted here for the sake of completing.\n\n343\n00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.830\nThere is one though, that is actually\ngrowing in its popularity, and\n\n344\n00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:03.240\nthat's because of the advent of\nonline services for companies, okay?\n\n345\n00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.000\nSo let's take for\nan example here at ITProTV.\n\n346\n00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.500\nWe use Office 365 and so when we do\nsomething like that it's perfectly fine\n\n347\n00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:18.510\nthat everybody uses, whether they're\nonline or offline, whatever it might be.\n\n348\n00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:22.140\nBut overall though, there's a couple\nof different ways that we can choose\n\n349\n00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.300\nauthentication and what we choose to do.\n\n350\n00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.200\nAnd it depends on what the company needs.\n\n351\n00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.850\nSo if we were a larger company,\nwhat we might find out is, man,\n\n352\n00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.190\nwe're switching over to\nOffice 365 Cherokee.\n\n353\n00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.090\nI've got 5000 users, okay?\n\n354\n00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:38.990\nThey're already loaded into\nmy active directory database.\n\n355\n00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.480\nWe're going to go to Office 365,\nand it's simple.\n\n356\n00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.910\nThe simplest way is,\nokay, so now Cherokee,\n\n357\n00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.450\nyou need to create 5,000\nuser accounts on Office 365.\n\n358\n00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:50.195\nSound fun?\n\n359\n00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:53.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No,\nI probably want to use an automation tool.\n\n360\n00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.600\nI'm sure there's one out there,\n\n361\n00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.185\nactually I know there are some\noptions that we have available.\n\n362\n00:17:58.185 --> 00:18:00.120\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but if I just told you that,\n\n363\n00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.130\nyou need to create 5,000 accounts.\n\n364\n00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:02.250\nWould that sound fun?\n\n365\n00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.680\nNo.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it wouldn't sound fun at all.\n\n366\n00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not at all.\n\n367\n00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.550\n&gt;&gt; And not only that though, let's say\nCherokee, you're actually there to create\n\n368\n00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.860\nthe original 5,000 on side of\nour Active Directory network.\n\n369\n00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:12.540\n&gt;&gt; Good.\n[LAUGH]\n\n370\n00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.190\n&gt;&gt; And so, let's say now I tell you\n\n371\n00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.640\nyou're doing it again, and you probably\nare, probably it's sinking in like\n\n372\n00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.670\n&gt;&gt; Wow, we don't want to do that again.\n\n373\n00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:20.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's where my mind's going,\n\n374\n00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.360\nI'm trying to think of an alternative\nbecause that does not sound fun.\n\n375\n00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.791\nI'm like there's got to be a better way.\n\n376\n00:18:24.791 --> 00:18:27.308\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There really is a better way, and\n\n377\n00:18:27.308 --> 00:18:30.931\nthat's why we can actually talk\nabout what we call here, SAML.\n\n378\n00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:35.350\nSAML, S A M L is\nSecurity Association Markup Language.\n\n379\n00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.900\nI wanted to make sure I\nget the words right, so\n\n380\n00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.826\nthat's why I'm\n&gt;&gt; I'm kind of looking down here.\n\n381\n00:18:38.826 --> 00:18:39.798\n&gt;&gt; SAML.\n&gt;&gt; SAML.\n\n382\n00:18:39.798 --> 00:18:41.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; SAM-L.\n\n383\n00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.580\nJust I guess it depends\non your accents there.\n\n384\n00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.280\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's all about\n\n385\n00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.010\nthe Security Assertion Markup language.\n\n386\n00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:51.310\nNow this is very cool,\nI think it's very cool.\n\n387\n00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:52.850\nBecause what this is going to do, and\n\n388\n00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:56.900\nhopefully it makes Cherokee's life easer,\nis that even though we've signed up for\n\n389\n00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:01.280\nOffice 365\n&gt;&gt; What I do, is I say let's do this.\n\n390\n00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.540\nLet's make sure that we actually do\nmake sure that Sam L is working, or\n\n391\n00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.150\nSamL is working.\n\n392\n00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:11.590\nAnd, what that means is that now, even\nthough all the users have their regular\n\n393\n00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:14.240\nActive Directory, all 5,000 of them,\n\n394\n00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:17.830\nthat they can use the same credentials\nto log in to their web services.\n\n395\n00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:18.460\nSound better?\n\n396\n00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:19.370\n&gt;&gt; Better.\n&gt;&gt; Because\n\n397\n00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.910\nit means you don't have to\ncreate those accounts anymore.\n\n398\n00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:23.250\n&gt;&gt; All right, I'll have to live at my job.\n\n399\n00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:23.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n400\n00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.670\n&gt;&gt; Shower and bathe in the sink.\n\n401\n00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:27.910\nYeah.\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; You have to do it by next week.\n\n402\n00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:31.580\nAnd so, so\nin this sense SAML helps to do that.\n\n403\n00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:36.570\nIt can allow us to take an existing\ndirectory service, okay And go on with it.\n\n404\n00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:40.270\nI know that there is actually\na third party service out there but\n\n405\n00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:44.320\nwhat we can about third party service is\ntell it we wanna implement sale mail and\n\n406\n00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.490\ninstead it can redirect us\nto what we call an IDP,\n\n407\n00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:51.710\nthe idea of an identity\nprovider is what it can do.\n\n408\n00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:54.800\nAn identity provider can be\nanything that we want to,\n\n409\n00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.210\neven something like Microsoft Active\nDirectory within my own network.\n\n410\n00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:58.810\nOkay?\n\n411\n00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:00.920\nSo that's why it's\nactually very important,\n\n412\n00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.980\nbecause it means that there's less work in\nthat sense where Cherokee is now having to\n\n413\n00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:11.070\ngo to active directory for Office 365 and\nrecreate all those accounts.\n\n414\n00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:15.080\nWe can essentially tie everything\ntogether and make it work on our behalf.\n\n415\n00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.870\nLet me show you how that works here.\n\n416\n00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.310\nWith of course a diagram.\n\n417\n00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:19.980\nCuz that's such easier to understand.\n\n418\n00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.670\nNow as we take a look at this diagram\nwe'll take it piece by piece here and\n\n419\n00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.320\ntry to show you how this works.\n\n420\n00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:30.330\nNotice that what we have here is Office\n365 and IDP, but notice everything\n\n421\n00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:35.740\nis going through the browser of who ever\nis actually connecting in to Office 365 So\n\n422\n00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:39.000\nthe browser is actually an important\nelement in everything that you see here.\n\n423\n00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.685\nNow let's take it using the colors.\n\n424\n00:20:40.685 --> 00:20:44.600\nBecause I know it looks a little bit\nharsh here when you start to see it.\n\n425\n00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.660\nSo the first time you open up the browser,\nyou connect to Office 365.\n\n426\n00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.790\nSo there it is.\n\n427\n00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:52.620\nYou are actually connecting to Office 365.\n\n428\n00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.390\nOkay.\n\n429\n00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:56.560\nWhen you do that and\nthis system is turned on,\n\n430\n00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:01.100\nOffice 365 will create what is\ncalled a SAML request, okay.\n\n431\n00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:02.580\nNow, I don't know what happened to my,\n\n432\n00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.320\nthere it goes,\nit kind of collapsed in a little bit here.\n\n433\n00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.530\nSAML request.\n\n434\n00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.300\nNow, the SAML request is\nactually an XML request.\n\n435\n00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:13.910\nHas a ton of stuff in it, an XML\nmarkup language or the XML language.\n\n436\n00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:14.650\nWhatever it's called.\n\n437\n00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:15.255\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we get it.\n\n438\n00:21:15.255 --> 00:21:17.960\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that will actually create that\n\n439\n00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.570\nparticular request.\n\n440\n00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:23.060\nAnd once it does that,\nwhat is the request going to do?\n\n441\n00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.200\nOffice 365 says hey,\nyou need to authenticate but\n\n442\n00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.190\nyou need to authenticate with your\nown active directory, Ronnie.\n\n443\n00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:32.060\nSo if I have an Active Directory,\nit will simply send\n\n444\n00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.850\nback a message that says all right,\nyou can connect Office 365,\n\n445\n00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:38.510\nbut you've got to authenticate\nwith your own Active Directory.\n\n446\n00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:41.090\nAnd the browser will\nthen send a request to\n\n447\n00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:44.120\nconnect back to your own\nActive Directory here.\n\n448\n00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.810\nThat particular IDP, that identity\nprovider, my Active Directory or\n\n449\n00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:54.570\nLDAP server, whatever it is that will\nactually read that SAML request and\n\n450\n00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.090\nauthenticate the user.\n\n451\n00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:01.270\nWhen it does it using SAML, it will then\ngenerate a response here in this kind\n\n452\n00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.870\nof orangish or\nmustard color that we see right here.\n\n453\n00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:11.540\nAnd at that point, the IDP will send\nback a response to the browser.\n\n454\n00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:12.840\nThe browser then,\n\n455\n00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.720\nat this purplish color here,\nwould then return it back to Office 365.\n\n456\n00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:23.110\nAnd if it's actually exactly what the SAML\nresponse says that it would be and\n\n457\n00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:27.680\nthe way that it actually was sent in other\nwords a reaction to the request here\n\n458\n00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.350\nthen the user will be able\nto log on to Office 365 and\n\n459\n00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.240\nget access to whatever\napplication that they need.\n\n460\n00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.820\nWithout having to actually go this one I\nneed a separate user name and password.\n\n461\n00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.790\nOr whatever other thing that\nI need to authenticate.\n\n462\n00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.740\nSo this process, in itself,\nreally does help because it\n\n463\n00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:47.530\nallows us to take the established\ndirectory that I already have and\n\n464\n00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:51.240\nnot have to create another piece of\ninfrastructure just because I chose to go\n\n465\n00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:56.120\nto some type of cloud service I can\nnow use my active directory log-on.\n\n466\n00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.550\nAnd that can actually be\navailable not only here, okay, but\n\n467\n00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:03.270\nalso available for\nme to gain access to the cloud.\n\n468\n00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.680\nAnd I've set this up before.\n\n469\n00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.020\nAnd if you go, Ronnie,\nthat's got to be easy.\n\n470\n00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:13.070\nIt's not easy as it sounds because this\nis actually where you're going to in\n\n471\n00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.850\nthe Microsoft.\n\n472\n00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:17.570\nThey call it Sam,\nthey call it Federated services, okay.\n\n473\n00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:18.790\n&gt;&gt; Yay.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah,\n\n474\n00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:22.160\nsetting up federated services\nsounds cool and sounds neat.\n\n475\n00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.960\nIt can be cool and\nit can be neat and as a result-\n\n476\n00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:25.830\n&gt;&gt; Depending on how many\n\n477\n00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:26.530\ndomains-\n&gt;&gt; It's setup.\n\n478\n00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:27.240\n&gt;&gt; You have as well.\n\n479\n00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:27.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n480\n00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:31.710\n&gt;&gt; Its setup is a little bit\nmore complex at times so.\n\n481\n00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.500\nSo do check that out if\nyou want to as well.\n\n482\n00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.220\nSo you can actually check\nout our Office 365 show, and\n\n483\n00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:39.400\nwe go through some of the process\nof setting this stuff up.\n\n484\n00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.120\n&gt;&gt; It would probably also be in\nthe Microsoft Server shows as well-\n\n485\n00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.270\n&gt;&gt; Yeah Microsoft servers.\n\n486\n00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:47.960\n&gt;&gt; Because they call that out\non the I know for the 70-412\n\n487\n00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:48.890\n&gt;&gt; 12 or 13,\n\n488\n00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.022\nthey definitely want you to go\nto those federated services.\n\n489\n00:23:51.022 --> 00:23:53.267\nYeah. [CROSSTALK] &gt;&gt; Yeah,\nall of the federated services.\n\n490\n00:23:53.267 --> 00:23:56.236\nYou'll learn much more in\ndepth about them there.\n\n491\n00:23:56.236 --> 00:23:59.467\nSo just remember that, okay?\n\n492\n00:23:59.467 --> 00:24:03.321\nIf you take a look at that\nideal SAML Really very much so,\n\n493\n00:24:03.321 --> 00:24:08.405\nespecially if you find that you end up\nworking for a company that has access\n\n494\n00:24:08.405 --> 00:24:13.880\nto third party or using the cloud\nas part of their infrastructure.\n\n495\n00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.810\nSAML might actually\nalready be the base of it.\n\n496\n00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:19.759\nBut have at least an understanding\nof that authentication process too.\n\n497\n00:24:19.759 --> 00:24:21.456\nNow it doesn't mean that you have to,\n\n498\n00:24:21.456 --> 00:24:25.200\nmost of these can say, you don't wanna\nuse your Active Directory, don't.\n\n499\n00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.420\nWell that's perfectly fine, but\n\n500\n00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.370\nthat means Cherokee's gonna have to\ncreate 5,000 different accounts.\n\n501\n00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.764\nSo that's good for me cuz.\n\n502\n00:24:31.764 --> 00:24:34.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Or maybe utilize a CSV file or\nsomething like that.\n\n503\n00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.225\nYeah, some kind of script.\n\n504\n00:24:35.225 --> 00:24:36.470\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Even with CSV\n\n505\n00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:37.975\nyou're not gonna be happy.\n\n506\n00:24:37.975 --> 00:24:40.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; With having to do that, okay.\n\n507\n00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:45.060\nNow, the last one I'm gonna talk about\nis that secure LDAP again, just briefly.\n\n508\n00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:49.720\nRemember that LDAP itself is not a secured\nprotocol by any means here, okay.\n\n509\n00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.080\nSo what you actually\nhave is all LDAP client,\n\n510\n00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.480\nall LDAP data normally is sent unsecured,\nokay.\n\n511\n00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:00.182\nAnd also, at the very beginning,\nright, when you get access to LDAP,\n\n512\n00:25:00.182 --> 00:25:05.080\nit's actually LDAP is kind of the protocol\nthat's responsible for all read and\n\n513\n00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.867\nwrite data coming to and going from\nsomething like Active Directory, okay.\n\n514\n00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:15.180\nSo that means that there needs to\nbe a security layer in between, and\n\n515\n00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.370\nmost of the time when this actually works,\n\n516\n00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:21.310\nwe implement this over SSL is\nwhat ends up happening, okay?\n\n517\n00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:26.100\nSo using the secure socket layer is\nwhat happens in most generic senses.\n\n518\n00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.854\nCuz the way that you normally see it\ntyped out, instead of just LDAP, L-D-A-P,\n\n519\n00:25:29.854 --> 00:25:35.250\nif it's secured you also see\nL-D-A-P S-S-L, is also how you see that.\n\n520\n00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:38.320\nBut it's really the big difference there,\nis that you do secure it instead.\n\n521\n00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.990\nIt still has all the same\nfunctionality as LDAP does, but\n\n522\n00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:45.920\nthis time using it over a secured\nprotocol like SSL instead.\n\n523\n00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.330\nSo there are a lot of\ndifferent functionalities.\n\n524\n00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:51.880\nEach one of them has their\nparticular use and their need.\n\n525\n00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:55.430\nRecommendation always is make\nsure you implement security.\n\n526\n00:25:55.430 --> 00:26:00.791\nBecause not implementing security on\nsomeone's authentication process and\n\n527\n00:26:00.791 --> 00:26:04.209\nprotocol or\nauthentication things that they do.\n\n528\n00:26:04.209 --> 00:26:06.430\nI wanna make sure I said the right word,\nprocess.\n\n529\n00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:10.440\nIt really is something that will\nbe a weakness in your systems.\n\n530\n00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.200\nSo make sure you actually think about and\n\n531\n00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.560\ntake a look at each one\nof these protocols, too.\n\n532\n00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:15.360\n&gt;&gt; Well Ronnie, thank you for\n\n533\n00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.890\ntaking the time to really go in depth and\nexplain these individually.\n\n534\n00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:20.720\nI know it might seem like a lot for\nyou guys, but\n\n535\n00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.840\nreally from a security\nstandpoint that's what we need.\n\n536\n00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.480\nWe need these processes and\n\n537\n00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.750\nprotocols in place to have all those extra\ncheck sums to keep our network secure.\n\n538\n00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.780\nSo thank you all for tuning in today.\n\n539\n00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:32.860\nI appreciate that.\n\n540\n00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.630\nWe have more Security Plus\ncoming your way, so stay tuned.\n\n541\n00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.190\nI'm your host, Cherokee Boose.\n\n542\n00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:39.040\n&gt;&gt;

00:00:10.677\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.506\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:12.506 --> 00:00:14.833\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:19.732\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong, and today\nwe're taking a look at CompTIA Security+.\n\n7\n00:00:19.732 --> 00:00:24.386\nWe're specifically going to be going\ninto the realm of understanding how we\n\n8\n00:00:24.386 --> 00:00:26.867\nactually perform some access control.\n\n9\n00:00:26.867 --> 00:00:28.619\nAnd here to help us out is\ngonna be Miss Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.022\nCherokee, welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:30.022 --> 00:00:31.255\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me today, Ronnie.\n\n12\n00:00:31.255 --> 00:00:32.166\nI'm super excited.\n\n13\n00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.796\nWe’re gonna go ahead and\n\n14\n00:00:33.796 --> 00:00:39.313\nget started here on identification versus\nauthentication versus authorization.\n\n15\n00:00:39.313 --> 00:00:40.495\nSo, I know that's a mouthful.\n\n16\n00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:43.030\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen, so\n\n17\n00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.424\nhopefully some visual will help\nsolidify this concept here.\n\n18\n00:00:46.424 --> 00:00:49.285\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nhave a story, as well.\n\n19\n00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:50.857\nWho doesn't like story time?\n\n20\n00:00:50.857 --> 00:00:55.779\nSo, underneath each one of these\ncategories, we have some examples,\n\n21\n00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:58.330\nand we'll go through those in a bit.\n\n22\n00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.594\nBut, when we're talking about network\naccess control and who has control within\n\n23\n00:01:02.594 --> 00:01:05.825\nour network, we need to go ahead and\nimplement it in some way.\n\n24\n00:01:05.825 --> 00:01:09.941\nSo CompTIA specifically\ncalls out these terms, and\n\n25\n00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:14.720\nwe really need to understand\nthe differences between them.\n\n26\n00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.023\nSo the first one I wanna go ahead and\ntake a look at here is identification.\n\n27\n00:01:19.023 --> 00:01:23.449\nSo here,\nI have an example of a driver's license.\n\n28\n00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:29.218\nSo here Cherokee Boose, let's just say\nI have a class D license in Florida.\n\n29\n00:01:29.218 --> 00:01:30.825\nThat's where we currently are, all right.\n\n30\n00:01:30.825 --> 00:01:35.115\nAnd I take my ID, my identification, and\n\n31\n00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:38.678\nI'm driving a giant semi, okay.\n\n32\n00:01:38.678 --> 00:01:41.641\n[LAUGH] And\nI get pulled over for speeding.\n\n33\n00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:43.273\nThat would never happen.\n\n34\n00:01:43.273 --> 00:01:48.309\nSo that officer's gonna go ahead and\ntake my identification back\n\n35\n00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:53.631\nto his patrol car and actually scan it and\ncheck it in their database.\n\n36\n00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:57.812\nSo he's authenticating that my\ndriver's license is in fact valid, and\n\n37\n00:01:57.812 --> 00:02:01.935\nI don't have any kind of warrants out for\nmy arrest or things like that.\n\n38\n00:02:01.935 --> 00:02:08.011\nSo what happens when an indication fails?\n\n39\n00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:12.634\nWell, maybe Cherokee wasn't so forthcoming\nand she really doesn't have a Class D\n\n40\n00:02:12.634 --> 00:02:16.145\ndriver's license and you know,\nCherokee's not happy here.\n\n41\n00:02:16.145 --> 00:02:19.019\nShe said and who knows,\nmaybe she has to go to jail.\n\n42\n00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.891\nBut authorization means is she\nallowed to drive a semi-truck or not?\n\n43\n00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:28.692\nSo once you've been authenticated,\nafter you've shown your identification,\n\n44\n00:02:28.692 --> 00:02:32.111\nand identification can mean\na few different things here.\n\n45\n00:02:32.111 --> 00:02:34.390\nBut those are three\ncompletely separate terms, so\n\n46\n00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.199\nI just want you to think\nof it in that way.\n\n47\n00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.109\nYou might have some other way\nyou think of it [LAUGH] but\n\n48\n00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.501\nthat's the best I could come up with here.\n\n49\n00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:46.924\nSo, when we look at identification,\nwe obviously, biometrics.\n\n50\n00:02:46.924 --> 00:02:49.633\nThis is something that\ncould be a retinal scan.\n\n51\n00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:52.398\nRetinal scans can be pretty invasive, so\n\n52\n00:02:52.398 --> 00:02:57.296\nthey're not as common as more of an iris\nscan, because retinal scans will\n\n53\n00:02:57.296 --> 00:03:02.194\nactually scan the blood vessels in your\neye which could be misconstrued as\n\n54\n00:03:02.194 --> 00:03:06.630\nknowing too much health information\nabout an individual person.\n\n55\n00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.501\nSo, iris scans just look at\nthe actual pattern of the eye.\n\n56\n00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:12.672\nSo those are probably more common.\n\n57\n00:03:12.672 --> 00:03:15.045\nWe have things like finger prints.\n\n58\n00:03:15.045 --> 00:03:16.634\nWe have voice recognition.\n\n59\n00:03:16.634 --> 00:03:18.011\nWe have facial recognition.\n\n60\n00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:21.437\nThose are all pretty mainstream now.\n\n61\n00:03:21.437 --> 00:03:24.956\nCell phones,\nobviously the type of biometric and\n\n62\n00:03:24.956 --> 00:03:29.815\nfacial recognition we have in our\nconsumer devices is going to be very\n\n63\n00:03:29.815 --> 00:03:34.539\ndifferent than what other\ngovernmental entities would be using.\n\n64\n00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:36.351\nBut still,\nit's a bit pretty common nowadays.\n\n65\n00:03:36.351 --> 00:03:38.668\nPersonal identification, so\n\n66\n00:03:38.668 --> 00:03:44.555\nwe'll also talk about different types\nof identification that's out there.\n\n67\n00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:49.481\nVerification cards and\nuser names and passwords also.\n\n68\n00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:51.293\nSo that would be one way\nto identify yourself.\n\n69\n00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:54.095\nBecause let's say I get\nhired at a company and\n\n70\n00:03:54.095 --> 00:03:58.078\nbefore the IT department issues\nme out a user name and password,\n\n71\n00:03:58.078 --> 00:04:02.359\nthe HR department has already done\ntheir due diligence and performed\n\n72\n00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:07.111\na background check and has a copy of my\ndrivers license and or social on file.\n\n73\n00:04:07.111 --> 00:04:10.162\nSo whenever I get my user name,\nit's backed by something.\n\n74\n00:04:10.162 --> 00:04:13.642\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee, when we start taking\na look at this idea of identification as\n\n75\n00:04:13.642 --> 00:04:16.571\nwell, don't forget that inside\nof companies if you're new to\n\n76\n00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:18.743\nthe idea of security and\nyou're not sure why.\n\n77\n00:04:18.743 --> 00:04:22.817\nIdentification is something that we\nneed to worry about or understand.\n\n78\n00:04:22.817 --> 00:04:26.443\nTake for example that you end up working\nfor a company and you have six or\n\n79\n00:04:26.443 --> 00:04:29.715\nseven different employees that\nare named John Smith, right?\n\n80\n00:04:29.715 --> 00:04:34.545\nWell the idea of identification is what\nit helps us to uniquely identify each and\n\n81\n00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:37.717\nevery one of those John Smiths or\nI like the example,\n\n82\n00:04:37.717 --> 00:04:42.358\nI normally use which is that there's\nsix or seven people named Ronnie Wong.\n\n83\n00:04:42.358 --> 00:04:45.420\nAnd if we can't\nindividually identify them,\n\n84\n00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.590\nwell then when payroll comes around,\nI always hope that what?\n\n85\n00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.982\nThey're gonna send me all five or\nsix of those paychecks instead.\n\n86\n00:04:51.982 --> 00:04:56.745\nSo identification is about being\nable to uniquely make sure that\n\n87\n00:04:56.745 --> 00:05:01.426\nthat person has some way that\nwe can identify them separately.\n\n88\n00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:06.377\nInside of databases, we may associate\nthem with things like also their\n\n89\n00:05:06.377 --> 00:05:10.433\nemployee ID number or\neven their social security number.\n\n90\n00:05:10.433 --> 00:05:15.316\nBut we could also individually identify\nthem by something that they might actually\n\n91\n00:05:15.316 --> 00:05:18.397\ngo ahead and\nhave in possession of them in a picture.\n\n92\n00:05:18.397 --> 00:05:20.886\nYou might be able to identify\nthem by a tattoo that they have.\n\n93\n00:05:20.886 --> 00:05:25.769\nYou never know, but identification is\nan important part of the concept of\n\n94\n00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:30.808\naccess control, so that if somebody\ndoes try to go into one of our machines,\n\n95\n00:05:30.808 --> 00:05:36.198\nhow do they know which particular Ronnie\nWong or John Smith is actually doing so?\n\n96\n00:05:36.198 --> 00:05:40.624\nSo, it's really important that we keep\nthe identities inside of our organizations\n\n97\n00:05:40.624 --> 00:05:44.822\nseparate it out, even though we may share\na lot of commonalities between them.\n\n98\n00:05:44.822 --> 00:05:49.396\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, and so we do have three\nconcepts that I want to remind you of.\n\n99\n00:05:49.396 --> 00:05:52.250\nYou might have heard of these\nbefore if you studied A+.\n\n100\n00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.046\nI think they mentioned them.\n\n101\n00:05:53.046 --> 00:05:54.277\nBut if not, that's okay.\n\n102\n00:05:54.277 --> 00:05:55.503\nWe'll go ahead and cover them here.\n\n103\n00:05:55.503 --> 00:05:58.317\nSo we have different forms\nof authentication factors.\n\n104\n00:05:58.317 --> 00:06:01.707\nAnd Ronnie mentioned things like\nyour social security number, but\n\n105\n00:06:01.707 --> 00:06:05.334\nthat's not something we want to just\nhave spread out in the public within\n\n106\n00:06:05.334 --> 00:06:07.423\nour organization or anything like that.\n\n107\n00:06:07.423 --> 00:06:08.778\nWe really wanna protect that number.\n\n108\n00:06:08.778 --> 00:06:10.326\nSo what if I go ahead and\n\n109\n00:06:10.326 --> 00:06:15.392\nattach that social security number to\nsomething that I have like a token.\n\n110\n00:06:15.392 --> 00:06:17.303\nSo let's take a look at\nthese three categories here.\n\n111\n00:06:17.303 --> 00:06:18.535\nWe’ll talk about it here.\n\n112\n00:06:18.535 --> 00:06:23.170\nSorry, there's something that you have,\nwhich would be a token.\n\n113\n00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:28.220\nSuch as you can have like a key fob or\nan ID badge that\n\n114\n00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.043\nwill give you access\nthroughout the building.\n\n115\n00:06:33.043 --> 00:06:38.121\nSomething you are, which is biometrics,\nand that could be like\n\n116\n00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:43.962\nwe spoke about the retinal scan,\nthe fingerprint or something you know.\n\n117\n00:06:43.962 --> 00:06:49.034\nAnd the way that CompTIA breaks that down,\nI want you guys to think about user and\n\n118\n00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:52.139\npassword, both fall under\nthat same category so\n\n119\n00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:56.166\nthat would not be considered\nmulti-factor authentication.\n\n120\n00:06:56.166 --> 00:07:00.172\nIf you were talking about\nmulti-factor authentication,\n\n121\n00:07:00.172 --> 00:07:03.785\nyou would need to think\nabout two Categories, okay.\n\n122\n00:07:03.785 --> 00:07:06.922\nSomething from two of those three\ncategories, two or more, okay.\n\n123\n00:07:06.922 --> 00:07:09.039\nSo obviously, the more you have,\n\n124\n00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:12.400\nthe more secure type of\nauthentication that would be.\n\n125\n00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.703\nSo if you think about going to the gas\npump and paying for your gas in that way.\n\n126\n00:07:16.703 --> 00:07:19.639\nYou could go ahead and provide or\nswipe your debit card, but\n\n127\n00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:23.692\nthey're gonna also ask you for some other\npiece of information like the zip code or\n\n128\n00:07:23.692 --> 00:07:26.155\nif you're running it as credit,\neither the pin or\n\n129\n00:07:26.155 --> 00:07:29.704\ncredit if you're running it that way,\ndepending on the way you run it.\n\n130\n00:07:29.704 --> 00:07:31.916\nThat would be an example of two things,\nokay?\n\n131\n00:07:31.916 --> 00:07:36.588\nSomething that you have, which would be\nthat card and then something you know,\n\n132\n00:07:36.588 --> 00:07:39.112\nwhich would be that PIN number or\nZIP code.\n\n133\n00:07:39.112 --> 00:07:43.307\nSo that would be an example of\nmulti factor authentication there.\n\n134\n00:07:43.307 --> 00:07:45.888\nSo, just kinda keep that in\nmind when we're talking about\n\n135\n00:07:45.888 --> 00:07:47.107\nauthentication factors.\n\n136\n00:07:47.107 --> 00:07:51.139\n&gt;&gt; When you start taking with that realm\nof authentication, what also tends to\n\n137\n00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:54.990\nhappen is that we have to be able to\nvalidate whatever we're presented.\n\n138\n00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.630\nSo, in that realm of authentication,\nthat's what you're doing.\n\n139\n00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.620\nYour identity is who you are.\n\n140\n00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.728\nBut the idea of actually\nbeing able to verify that,\n\n141\n00:08:01.728 --> 00:08:03.747\nthat's really the process\nof authentication.\n\n142\n00:08:03.747 --> 00:08:06.812\nSo the example that Cherokee\ngave us there, right,\n\n143\n00:08:06.812 --> 00:08:11.353\nis that it may be that Cherokee goes and\nfills up her gas tank by using the card.\n\n144\n00:08:11.353 --> 00:08:16.334\nBut it could be that I actually\nsneak out Cherokee's card out\n\n145\n00:08:16.334 --> 00:08:20.154\nof her wallet and\nthen also fill up my gas tank.\n\n146\n00:08:20.154 --> 00:08:23.947\nWell hopefully that second factor\nthat she was mentioning there,\n\n147\n00:08:23.947 --> 00:08:27.195\nsuch as that PIN number or\nwhatever it might be, proves,\n\n148\n00:08:27.195 --> 00:08:30.870\nit actually validates that the card\nbelongs to her and not to me.\n\n149\n00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.290\nAnd so as long as I don't have both,\nI'm fine.\n\n150\n00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:37.620\nSo think about that idea of authentication\nas being some type of verification\n\n151\n00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.520\nof that identity as well and\nthat really kind of helps us.\n\n152\n00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.120\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n153\n00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.340\nAnd we see that all the time, Ronnie,\nnot just at the bank or the gas pumps.\n\n154\n00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.810\nBut we see that in banks, and\neven when you go ahead and create accounts\n\n155\n00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.330\nonline they might send you a pin number\nto your cell phone and things like that.\n\n156\n00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:59.530\nSo it just makes that account a little\nbit more secure or that's access.\n\n157\n00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:04.410\nNow lastly we have, so\nthis is another example of\n\n158\n00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.410\nmutual authentication that\nyou might see in a military.\n\n159\n00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.023\nWhat we're looking at here is a CAC Card,\na little redundant.\n\n160\n00:09:10.023 --> 00:09:13.520\nSo the acronym is Common Access Card.\n\n161\n00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.350\nSo when people say CAC cards, it's kinda\nfunny, it's like Common Access Card card.\n\n162\n00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.765\nBut that's normally have\npeople abbreviate that.\n\n163\n00:09:19.765 --> 00:09:25.230\nAnd in addition to providing your CAC\ncard to access some sort of governmental\n\n164\n00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.953\nresource, so I think that was\ndistributive came after 9/11.\n\n165\n00:09:29.953 --> 00:09:34.160\nIt was actually the Homeland\nSecurity Presidential Derivative.\n\n166\n00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.280\nAnd if you wanna go ahead and\nhave access to federal property, they\n\n167\n00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.270\nissue out these CAT cards to civilian\nemployees, military personnel and\n\n168\n00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:48.660\ncontractors to gain access to\nDepartment of Defense resources.\n\n169\n00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.220\nSo, in addition to providing\nyour CAC card into that device,\n\n170\n00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.420\nusually you might have to swipe it or\ninsert it.\n\n171\n00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.380\nYou would also have to\nput in your username and\n\n172\n00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.230\npassword, so\nthis would be something that you have\n\n173\n00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:02.160\nin addition to something that you\nknow like that username and password.\n\n174\n00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.040\nSo that would be another example of\nmulti-factor authentication there.\n\n175\n00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.820\nYou also have different types,\nother types of identification out there.\n\n176\n00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.540\nYou might hear an acronym\ncalled PIV which stands for\n\n177\n00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.080\nPersonal Identification Verification.\n\n178\n00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.300\nAnd that is gonna be used for\ncivilian federal government employees and\n\n179\n00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.580\ncontractors.\n\n180\n00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.600\nAnd there's another one out there.\n\n181\n00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.210\nIt's called your FRAC, which stands for\nfirst responder access credential.\n\n182\n00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.570\nThis is gonna be used by first responders\nin the event of an emergency to\n\n183\n00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.340\naccess certain buildings.\n\n184\n00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.150\nJust to make sure that they can go\nahead and rescue people accordingly.\n\n185\n00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.320\nSo you have different\nbadges to go ahead and\n\n186\n00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.330\ndifferentiate the different\nlevels of access there.\n\n187\n00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.280\nAnd even in the most basic form,\nlike here at ITProTV.\n\n188\n00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.051\nWe have little lanyards or I have\na lanyard with my actual token on here.\n\n189\n00:10:48.051 --> 00:10:55.000\nAnd I can gain access into certain\nrooms by swiping my token.\n\n190\n00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.059\nSo I'm not gonna be able to get into\ncertain areas of the building that I don't\n\n191\n00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:02.068\nneed to, and that's one way\nwe can limit who has access.\n\n192\n00:11:02.068 --> 00:11:04.941\nSo that's a form of an access\ncontrol list as well, and\n\n193\n00:11:04.941 --> 00:11:07.073\nwe'll talk about that in a few moments.\n\n194\n00:11:07.073 --> 00:11:08.651\nWhat else?\n\n195\n00:11:08.651 --> 00:11:11.577\nOkay, let's go back and\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n196\n00:11:11.577 --> 00:11:15.269\nOkay, so what we're looking at here,\nwe have HOTP.\n\n197\n00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:20.464\nThis is going to be\nan HMAC-based One-time Password Algorithm.\n\n198\n00:11:20.464 --> 00:11:25.412\nSo what we have here is an end-user\nwho wants to gain access to\n\n199\n00:11:25.412 --> 00:11:28.120\nmy network resources.\n\n200\n00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.769\nSo I may provide them in\na number of methods here,\n\n201\n00:11:31.769 --> 00:11:36.575\nit could be an application on a smart\nphone, it could be a badge on\n\n202\n00:11:36.575 --> 00:11:42.420\na lanyard with a token, here I actually\nhave a picture of RSA token here.\n\n203\n00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:49.620\nAnd whenever that particular value is\nadded, then we're gonna go ahead and\n\n204\n00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:55.690\napply a hash algorithm to that value\nwhich will generate a hash value.\n\n205\n00:11:55.690 --> 00:12:02.460\nSo once we have a hash value generated,\nwe need to compare it to a authentication\n\n206\n00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:06.740\nserver in order to actually gain\naccess to those network resources.\n\n207\n00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.840\nSo if those two values do match,\nthen that end user is good to go.\n\n208\n00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.110\nSo that's one way we can go ahead and\nverify authentication there.\n\n209\n00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:19.890\nNow a little bit more secure\nwould be something like TOTP,\n\n210\n00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.920\nwhich is\nTime-based One-time Password Algorithm.\n\n211\n00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.795\nAnd because HOTP doesn't really time out,\n\n212\n00:12:26.795 --> 00:12:30.676\nit's not as secure as TOTP,\nwhich would need to go ahead and\n\n213\n00:12:30.676 --> 00:12:36.504\nconstantly refresh normally in 60 seconds\nintervals, that's pretty common also but\n\n214\n00:12:36.504 --> 00:12:41.190\nit's just a little bit more secure\nthere by adding that extra measure.\n\n215\n00:12:44.359 --> 00:12:49.120\nSo what we're looking at here is PAP,\nPassword Authentication Protocol.\n\n216\n00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.730\nThis is another authentication option,\nwe do have available to us.\n\n217\n00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:57.020\nIt was developed as part of\nthe TCP/IP Point-to-Point Protocol.\n\n218\n00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.980\nWhich should be used over TCP\n/ IP networks to go ahead and\n\n219\n00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:05.060\ntransfer that data over those TCP/ IP or\nserial, or dial up connections.\n\n220\n00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.220\nSo this is an older,\nmore antiquated protocol.\n\n221\n00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nAnd the idea of this older protocol.\n\n222\n00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:13.700\nIt might be something that you\nstill have to consider today\n\n223\n00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.200\nbecause there are certain\ntypes of machines\n\n224\n00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.540\nthat don't support something any\nnewer than what we see right here.\n\n225\n00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:25.110\nSo if you do still have one of those older\nunits, machines that's lying around, and\n\n226\n00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:26.590\nthe only thing that they support is PAP,\n\n227\n00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.630\nyou definitely need to make\nsure that you use this.\n\n228\n00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.550\nNow, remember that when you start\ntaking a look at when this was\n\n229\n00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.490\nimplemented is the key.\n\n230\n00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:35.610\nSo Cherokee is right,\n\n231\n00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.860\nthis is not something we would generally\nuse on today's types of networks where we\n\n232\n00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:44.310\nhave a lot of people on those connections\nespecially with inside of a LAN but\n\n233\n00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:48.330\nin the days of serial connections and\nthe dial up types of connections.\n\n234\n00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.780\nYou really have the idea of the client\nconnecting into the server and\n\n235\n00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:56.770\nthat meant a point to point connection\nwith only two availability in\n\n236\n00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:01.390\nterms of IP addresses really\ngoing on between those systems.\n\n237\n00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.970\nSo it really did not allow for\na third particular user to\n\n238\n00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.830\nbe able to get access in, unless they\nphysically had access to that line.\n\n239\n00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:12.370\nNow, that doesn't mean that it\nactually has any additional security,\n\n240\n00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:17.310\nbut you more than likely were limited in\nterms of what you could do, so know that\n\n241\n00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:21.890\nyou'll probably not see this in most of\nthe types of connection that we use today.\n\n242\n00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:27.150\nBut as much as people say it's totally not\nsecure in the day that it was implemented,\n\n243\n00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:30.260\nit was probably as secure as you could\nhave without physically actually\n\n244\n00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:31.210\ntapping into that line.\n\n245\n00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:33.240\n&gt;&gt; Exactly and that's what this\nbad guy could be doing there.\n\n246\n00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.615\nHe could be physically\ntapping into this connection.\n\n247\n00:14:35.615 --> 00:14:38.463\nIn today's environment we\nhave a lot of wireless, so\n\n248\n00:14:38.463 --> 00:14:42.028\nyou do have to be careful about\nsending information in clear text.\n\n249\n00:14:42.028 --> 00:14:46.056\nSo this would be, here I have my end user\ntrying to connect to the resources on my\n\n250\n00:14:46.056 --> 00:14:49.000\nlocal area network and\nI have my authentication server.\n\n251\n00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.090\nSo in order for\nthat end user to authenticate,\n\n252\n00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.030\nthey send that information in clear text.\n\n253\n00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.140\nMost modern networks today when\nwe hear that term clear text,\n\n254\n00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:02.390\nwe kind of wanna just be aware of\nthat information and the possibility,\n\n255\n00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.480\nthe risk that it brings\nto our environment.\n\n256\n00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:09.770\nSo, as an improvement, we do have another\noption here, something called CHAP.\n\n257\n00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:13.670\nWhich stands for challenge\nhandshake authentication protocol.\n\n258\n00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.270\nAnd the reason it's named so,\n\n259\n00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:19.680\nis because there is a three-way\nhandshake process that actually happens.\n\n260\n00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.750\nNow this isn't the same three-way\nhandshake process that we spoke\n\n261\n00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.800\nabout with TCP connections.\n\n262\n00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.000\nBut let's go ahead and\n\n263\n00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.980\ntake a look at that here,\nthe first step would be the challenge.\n\n264\n00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.280\nSo our actual authentication server\n\n265\n00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:36.460\nfirstly will be sending\na challenge to that end user.\n\n266\n00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.220\nThey send that challenge to the client,\n\n267\n00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.960\nsending a randomly generated\nchallenge message.\n\n268\n00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.880\nSo then that client will then go ahead and\n\n269\n00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.130\nrespond back to that\nauthentication server.\n\n270\n00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:50.980\nWith a hash that has been calculated\nfrom the server challenge message and\n\n271\n00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.270\nthe password.\n\n272\n00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:56.686\nNow whenever that authentication server\nreceives that information, all right,\n\n273\n00:15:56.686 --> 00:16:00.672\nthe server performs its own hash using\nthe password stored for the client.\n\n274\n00:16:00.672 --> 00:16:02.659\nIt's gonna be comparing\nit up to it's database.\n\n275\n00:16:02.659 --> 00:16:05.506\nAnd if it matches the response\nthen access is granted\n\n276\n00:16:05.506 --> 00:16:08.170\notherwise that connection\nis just terminated.\n\n277\n00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:11.440\nSo here we got our little check mark and\nthat is when the user will be\n\n278\n00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.639\ngranted access to those local\narea network resources.\n\n279\n00:16:14.639 --> 00:16:17.630\n&gt;&gt; Now the other thing that you\nalso have here that makes it\n\n280\n00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:22.120\nstronger than the idea of PAP, right, is\nthat when we used PAP we're just saying,\n\n281\n00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.700\nhere's what the password is.\n\n282\n00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.440\nAnd the authentication server, itself\non the other end just verifies that,\n\n283\n00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.590\nyep, that's the correct password.\n\n284\n00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:34.650\nNotice that in this exchange the password\nis never sent across the connection.\n\n285\n00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:39.010\nWhat we have though is simply\na challenge that's issued by the server.\n\n286\n00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:43.110\nSo you can think about it, going back to\nthe idea of just basic algebraic math\n\n287\n00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:47.510\nhere of solving for\nx and trying to do that.\n\n288\n00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:51.140\nSo when you have something\nlike 1 plus x equals 4,\n\n289\n00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.420\nwell, they send that over back\nto the client essentially.\n\n290\n00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.320\nAnd then, well,\n\n291\n00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.060\nthe client has to generate and figure out,\nwell, how do I actually solve for x?\n\n292\n00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:03.030\nThey send x back to the server and\nthe server then goes you're correct.\n\n293\n00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:07.308\nOr if you don't know what that is then\nwhat happens at that point is that you\n\n294\n00:17:07.308 --> 00:17:11.934\nhave to actually, the server says nope,\nthat's not the correct connection.\n\n295\n00:17:11.934 --> 00:17:14.046\nBut notice that you never\nknow what the password is.\n\n296\n00:17:14.046 --> 00:17:16.329\nIt's gonna have to be\ngenerated in some way.\n\n297\n00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:20.310\nAnd even though I use a simplistic math\nproblem, this is generated in a very\n\n298\n00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:24.365\nhighly, much more complex mathematics\nin terms of the hash value.\n\n299\n00:17:24.365 --> 00:17:28.445\nBut it keys into the things like your\nusername and password to be included in\n\n300\n00:17:28.445 --> 00:17:32.280\nthis hash value, and that's how\nthey generate that for you instead.\n\n301\n00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.760\nSo it's neat,\nwhere they already have what's stored,\n\n302\n00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.260\nwhat they're expecting to see.\n\n303\n00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.330\nAnd you just have to figure out\nwhat answer you're giving them.\n\n304\n00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.930\nSo that's why this is\nconsidered much more secure.\n\n305\n00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.750\nAnd you use this along with encryption.\n\n306\n00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.078\nYou truly do have a much more\nsecure idea [CROSSTALK]-\n\n307\n00:17:46.078 --> 00:17:48.345\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're making that attacker\n\n308\n00:17:48.345 --> 00:17:50.239\nwork for their access there.\n\n309\n00:17:50.239 --> 00:17:52.468\nThey'd have to do some\nwork to go ahead and\n\n310\n00:17:52.468 --> 00:17:54.571\nget that authentication to go ahead and\n\n311\n00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:58.980\ndecrypt that encrypted traffic cuz we're\nnot just sending it in clear text here.\n\n312\n00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:03.240\nAnd another cool thing is that\nthe authentication server will randomly\n\n313\n00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.500\nregenerate that challenge periodically\nthroughout that session, so\n\n314\n00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:11.831\nthat communication, so that we're\npreventing any kind of hijacking or\n\n315\n00:18:11.831 --> 00:18:13.830\nman in the middle attacks there.\n\n316\n00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.553\nSo that's pretty cool as well.\n\n317\n00:18:15.553 --> 00:18:19.494\nAnd this was also developed as part of\nthe point to point protocol as a means of\n\n318\n00:18:19.494 --> 00:18:21.725\nauthenticating users over a remote link.\n\n319\n00:18:21.725 --> 00:18:26.765\nSo you'll see this a lot with any kind\nof remote access configurations there.\n\n320\n00:18:26.765 --> 00:18:31.571\nTypically, one way authentication,\nmore commonly we'll see Cisco and\n\n321\n00:18:31.571 --> 00:18:35.840\nMicrosoft implementing\nmutual authentication there.\n\n322\n00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.400\nAnd the way you'll see Microsoft's\nwritten out will be MS-CHAP.\n\n323\n00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.840\nThat's their variation of this protocol.\n\n324\n00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:47.740\nAnd just know that there are other, I\nguess, more secure protocols out there or\n\n325\n00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.370\nmaybe more popular such as EAP,\nextensible authentication protocol.\n\n326\n00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.370\nThat's a little more flexible.\n\n327\n00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.060\nSo you'll have those options as well.\n\n328\n00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.824\nAnd next,\nwe have this idea of single sign-on.\n\n329\n00:18:59.824 --> 00:19:05.700\nSo in most environments we\nhave this concept of a domain.\n\n330\n00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.421\nMicrosoft owns a vast majority\nof that marketshare out there so\n\n331\n00:19:09.421 --> 00:19:14.261\nwe can go ahead and create our Microsoft\ndomains and this idea of single sign-on,\n\n332\n00:19:14.261 --> 00:19:18.490\na true single sign-on means that\nI'm granted username and password.\n\n333\n00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:23.088\nI might have to have some other\nadditional form of authentication,\n\n334\n00:19:23.088 --> 00:19:28.350\nan authentication factor such as a token,\nto go ahead and log on once.\n\n335\n00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:32.142\nSo, single sign on is going to\nenable me to log on once and\n\n336\n00:19:32.142 --> 00:19:36.664\nhave access to many network resources so\nthat I don't have to go and\n\n337\n00:19:36.664 --> 00:19:40.945\nlog onto my email server and\nsome kind of application server and\n\n338\n00:19:40.945 --> 00:19:44.387\neverything would just be\npretty time consuming.\n\n339\n00:19:44.387 --> 00:19:47.416\nWell, with this one username and\npassword or\n\n340\n00:19:47.416 --> 00:19:52.356\nthis one single sign on you really have\nto be careful to make sure you choose\n\n341\n00:19:52.356 --> 00:19:56.988\na secure password and you're not\njust leaving it exposed in any way.\n\n342\n00:19:56.988 --> 00:19:59.060\nSo If I didn't have single sign on,\n\n343\n00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.581\nlet's say that I just had a peer\nto peer style network set up,\n\n344\n00:20:02.581 --> 00:20:07.350\nI would have to have a user account\non every single, individual machine.\n\n345\n00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.855\nHowever, with single sign on I don't\nhave to set them up individually.\n\n346\n00:20:10.855 --> 00:20:16.380\nSo it definitely creates, I guess, less\nadministrative work in the environment.\n\n347\n00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:20.380\nYou go ahead and set up that once on the\nadministrative side, so it's easier for\n\n348\n00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:23.020\nthe end users and the IT department.\n\n349\n00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:26.130\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no doubt that single\nsign on is the way that you normally\n\n350\n00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:29.930\nneed to do things, once your network\nstarts scaling out and scaling up,\n\n351\n00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.380\nin other words, growing.\n\n352\n00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:35.548\nThe reason why is trying to ensure that\neverybody has access to what they need to\n\n353\n00:20:35.548 --> 00:20:38.327\non an individual user basis\nbecomes a little bit more\n\n354\n00:20:38.327 --> 00:20:42.134\nunmanageable as you start growing beyond,\nlet's say, 10 to 20.\n\n355\n00:20:42.134 --> 00:20:43.481\nNow you have four servers.\n\n356\n00:20:43.481 --> 00:20:48.345\nWell, you can imagine everybody needing\na single or multiple passwords for\n\n357\n00:20:48.345 --> 00:20:50.560\nevery single user that's there.\n\n358\n00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.250\nNow you don't actually know how to\ntrack every single one and whether or\n\n359\n00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:56.030\nnot they're getting access to\nthe things that they need to.\n\n360\n00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:59.640\nSo when you do something like that,\nremember that, normally, if you're just\n\n361\n00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:04.260\nusing, or implementing something\nlike multiple passwords like that,\n\n362\n00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:09.558\nusually the other problem that you have\nis you also don't control the access.\n\n363\n00:21:09.558 --> 00:21:12.040\nIn other words, they're password\nis essentially gives them access\n\n364\n00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.920\nto everything on those individual servers.\n\n365\n00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.760\nThe neat thing about using something\nlike single sign on in the process\n\n366\n00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.830\nis that we're no longer just depending\non the password to be the last line\n\n367\n00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:28.190\nof authentication in the process\nhere as far as access control.\n\n368\n00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:31.580\nWhat happens is that even though\nyou have a single password, now,\n\n369\n00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:34.260\nyou can use that single sign on,\n\n370\n00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:39.320\nnot password itself,\nto also limit and control access.\n\n371\n00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:43.330\nSo I might give Cherokee access to\njust her folder on a file server.\n\n372\n00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:47.960\nI might only give her access to, well,\none of these things that she can access on\n\n373\n00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:52.800\napplication server as well but she\ndoesn't have access to the entire server.\n\n374\n00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.270\nWell, then I can come along and\ngive myself more access.\n\n375\n00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.230\nAnd this is without\nCherokee actually knowing\n\n376\n00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:03.200\nthat it's actually happening\nnot because of her username and\n\n377\n00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.580\npassword, but it's because of her own\nprofile and the way that we control\n\n378\n00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.030\nthe access through something we'll\nlearn about later on in authorization.\n\n379\n00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:12.130\nSo it allows us to combine that and\n\n380\n00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.180\nnot just depend on that idea of\na password being a security.\n\n381\n00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:19.250\nIt actually says, look that single\nsign on, it gives you access but\n\n382\n00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:21.670\nit doesn't give you complete access.\n\n383\n00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:26.120\nSo it really is a neat thing for\nus to think about as well.\n\n384\n00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:30.353\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so like Ronnie said access\ncontrol, access control is pretty basic.\n\n385\n00:22:30.353 --> 00:22:34.138\nIt's the idea of just\ncontrolling who has access and\n\n386\n00:22:34.138 --> 00:22:38.785\nby attaching permissions with\na particular user account you can\n\n387\n00:22:38.785 --> 00:22:42.914\neasily control who has access\nto what network resource,\n\n388\n00:22:42.914 --> 00:22:47.890\nwhich brings us to another\nconcept called implicit deny.\n\n389\n00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:51.390\nSo implicit deny is something you\nsee very commonly on firewalls.\n\n390\n00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:55.280\nSo they go ahead and configure them by\ndefault to say look we're gonna go ahead\n\n391\n00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:00.890\nand block all forms of incoming traffic\nunless you explicitly allow it.\n\n392\n00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:05.646\nSo, by default I'm implicitly denying\nall incoming forms of traffic.\n\n393\n00:23:05.646 --> 00:23:07.829\nSo, that's one way to just kind of secure,\n\n394\n00:23:07.829 --> 00:23:11.520\nit says concept that you can\nimplement in a number of ways.\n\n395\n00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.080\nAnd the last one we wanna go ahead and\ntake a look at here with this\n\n396\n00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.045\nidea is something called trusted\noperating system, so TOS.\n\n397\n00:23:19.045 --> 00:23:23.580\nWe've spoke about this in another episode\nand we talked about our common criteria\n\n398\n00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:27.800\nwhere the actual operating systems\nthemselves are going to be having to\n\n399\n00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:33.460\nbe graded with our EALs to be ranked and\nmake sure that\n\n400\n00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:37.950\nthey're going through the proper steps so\ncompanies are gonna have to submit their\n\n401\n00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:41.730\noperating systems before we integrate\nthem into a secure environment.\n\n402\n00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:45.765\nSo there are things that we can do as\nadministrators on our side, but then\n\n403\n00:23:45.765 --> 00:23:49.800\nthe software companies, hardware companies\nhave to get approved for as well.\n\n404\n00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.980\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee, going back to that idea,\nthe implicit deny for just a moment.\n\n405\n00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:58.247\nWe also need to understand that this is\nnormally a standard type of policy that we\n\n406\n00:23:58.247 --> 00:23:59.480\nput in place.\n\n407\n00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:04.380\nWe want users inside of our network for\nwhat they can do,\n\n408\n00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:08.620\nwhen we start getting access to things,\nis to be able to have enough privileges to\n\n409\n00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:12.480\nwork inside of that environment and\nnot need to actually do anything else.\n\n410\n00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:16.450\nBut we also want to deny them access\nto everything that they don't need.\n\n411\n00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.110\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; So by doing an implicit deny what\n\n412\n00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:23.820\nwe're actually saying is, we will allow\nfor only the access that is needed.\n\n413\n00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:27.890\nIn other words the way that Cherokee\ndescribed it, explicitly allowing those\n\n414\n00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:31.290\nbecause the other way to try and\ndo this is just to sit and go, okay,\n\n415\n00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.390\nCherokee, you're gonna\nget access to everything.\n\n416\n00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:37.830\nAnd after a while, hopefully, I'll come\nback and I'll restrict your access.\n\n417\n00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:39.258\nWell that's where a problem\ndoes end up coming in.\n\n418\n00:24:39.258 --> 00:24:40.306\n&gt;&gt; Not a good idea, yeah [LAUGH].\n\n419\n00:24:40.306 --> 00:24:44.254\n&gt;&gt; Because I may forget one, or\nall of the sudden now, I say, all right-\n\n420\n00:24:44.254 --> 00:24:44.992\n&gt;&gt; It's too late.\n\n421\n00:24:44.992 --> 00:24:46.910\n&gt;&gt; Here's Cherokee's job role.\n\n422\n00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.420\nAnd now I restrict it and Cherokee goes,\n\n423\n00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.500\nwell, this is the only way\nI know how to do this.\n\n424\n00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:54.130\nWell, we have to retrain Cherokee to\nactually figure out how to do the job\n\n425\n00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:57.130\nthe right way, which should have been\nfrom the very beginning where we set up\n\n426\n00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:00.870\nthose particular access,\nthat type of structure.\n\n427\n00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:05.900\nSo by doing that implicit deny,\nit really is something that we do rely on.\n\n428\n00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.650\nAnd it's a great type of policy to\nreally help us when it comes down to\n\n429\n00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.100\naccess control as well.\n\n430\n00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:15.950\nSo, all right Cherokee, we've got\na couple of more things that we have to\n\n431\n00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:17.830\nactually address, but we are out of time.\n\n432\n00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:20.177\nAny last words on the authentication?\n\n433\n00:25:20.177 --> 00:25:21.475\n&gt;&gt; You were doing\na really great job there,\n\n434\n00:25:21.475 --> 00:25:25.065\nkind of segueing into that concepts\nof principle of lease privilege, but\n\n435\n00:25:25.065 --> 00:25:28.365\nlet's go ahead and stop here, so we're not\nrushing through it and we'll go ahead and\n\n436\n00:25:28.365 --> 00:25:32.725\nstart with our authorization and\ngo ahead and talk about some fundamentals,\n\n437\n00:25:32.725 --> 00:25:35.485\nsome core concepts associated\nwith security there.\n\n438\n00:25:35.485 --> 00:25:38.830\n&gt;&gt; All right, that means we're\ncoming back for a part two.\n\n439\n00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:42.690\nSo, this is a great place for\nus to also sign off as well.\n\n440\n00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:46.160\nSo signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Ronnie Wong.\n\n441\n00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.150\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n442\n00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:51.391\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right

00:00:08.394\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.394 --> 00:00:12.601\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITPro.TV.\n\n5\n00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:15.700\n&gt;&gt; Welcome to another great\nepisode right here on ITPro.TV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.410\nI'm your host Ronnie Wong and today\nwe're going into CompTIA security plus.\n\n7\n00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.460\nWe're specifically gonna be looking\nat a part 2 on access control,\n\n8\n00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.920\nwe've already identified a little bit of\nthe ways that we do authentication and\n\n9\n00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.300\nnow here to help us to understand the rest\nof access control is Cherokee Boose.\n\n10\n00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.530\nCherokee welcome back to the show.\n\n11\n00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.610\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me.\n\n12\n00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.450\nYeah In the last episode we were\ntalking about our different methods.\n\n13\n00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.210\nWe even looked at identification,\nwe had authentication.\n\n14\n00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.930\nAnd now we finally made\nit to our authorization.\n\n15\n00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.430\nSo we're gonna go ahead and just recap\nreal quick, to refresh your memory.\n\n16\n00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.510\nLet's go ahead and\ntake a look at my screen here.\n\n17\n00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.720\nWe had identification, right?\n\n18\n00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.460\nSo remember, this was providing\nsome form of identification.\n\n19\n00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.700\nAnd then once we provide that\nidentification, authentication\n\n20\n00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.440\nwas the actual process of well,\nis that news or actually authenticated?\n\n21\n00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.370\nAnd is this information correct?\n\n22\n00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.110\nDoes it match what I have\nlisted here in my database?\n\n23\n00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.490\nAre they legit?\n\n24\n00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.190\nAnd now let's go ahead and\nget into the realm of authorization, okay?\n\n25\n00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.800\nSo now that, that user has provided\nidentification, has been authenticated.\n\n26\n00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.520\nNow, are they authorized to access that\nresource in which they're requesting?\n\n27\n00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.840\nSo we have this concept of\nthe principle of least privilege.\n\n28\n00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.510\nAnd the principle of the least privileged\nstates, that we're only going to be\n\n29\n00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.285\ngranting access to a user on the need\nto know or the need to basis.\n\n30\n00:01:42.285 --> 00:01:45.980\nThey're only giving enough access\nto perform their job role or\n\n31\n00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.205\ntheir daily function.\n\n32\n00:01:47.205 --> 00:01:49.540\nSo we're not just\nblanketing full control or\n\n33\n00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.840\nfull access to everyone\nwithin our organization.\n\n34\n00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.390\nAnd we'll take a look at some different\nmodels of how we can actually implement\n\n35\n00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.110\nour principal of least privilege here.\n\n36\n00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.690\nSo, there's a couple of different way\nwe could go ahead and approach that.\n\n37\n00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.920\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Cherokee,\n\n38\n00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.730\nwhen we start taking a look at this idea\nof the principal of least privilege,\n\n39\n00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:15.310\nwhy is it so important that we implement\nsomething like this for our organizations?\n\n40\n00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.920\n&gt;&gt; Well it's mainly going to\nbe because we don't wanna give\n\n41\n00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.940\ntoo much information to someone\nwho really just doesn't need it.\n\n42\n00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.210\nSo they can stay focused\non their tasks and\n\n43\n00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.950\nany sensitive information\nisn't gonna be leaking out.\n\n44\n00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.900\nSo for instance, if I had someone\nwho was a help desk technician,\n\n45\n00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.810\nwould they really need to see all the HR\ndocuments for all the other employees and\n\n46\n00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.180\nknow everyone's salary?\n\n47\n00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.870\nNo.\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna go\n\n48\n00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.710\nahead and restrict access, so\n\n49\n00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.330\nthat individual can have a log\non to their system to help\n\n50\n00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.610\nremote into others whenever they get calls\nand tickets coming in to that help desk.\n\n51\n00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.188\nBut they're not able to access any kind\nof corporate financial information or\n\n52\n00:02:53.188 --> 00:02:56.970\nco-worker's personal information and\n\n53\n00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.990\nthat's something we really want to keep\nin mind, it's just a way we go ahead.\n\n54\n00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.465\nNormally we are going to be separating\nthem out into roles within a environment,\n\n55\n00:03:06.465 --> 00:03:08.590\nan enterprise environment, but\n\n56\n00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.250\nwe have a couple different\nmethods that we'll look at here.\n\n57\n00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.800\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, the idea of using least privilege\nis something that every organization\n\n58\n00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.060\nshould consider as part of the security\nand when dealing with the idea here,\n\n59\n00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.180\nof course, of authorization.\n\n60\n00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.010\nRemember that authorization really\nkinda boils down to what we allow for\n\n61\n00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.950\nthat user to do once\nthey've authenticated.\n\n62\n00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.250\nSo once we know who they are,\nand they validated that,\n\n63\n00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.020\nnow the idea of authorization\nreally does help us to do this.\n\n64\n00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.570\nAnd we want to begin with that idea\nof least privilege, not give them\n\n65\n00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.800\ntoo much to be able to run wild and\nget access to everything that they need.\n\n66\n00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.030\nBut just enough to do what their job\nprescribes for them to do, but not so\n\n67\n00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.506\nrestrictive that they\ncan't do their job either.\n\n68\n00:03:52.506 --> 00:03:56.720\nSo there's a fine balance there when it\ncomes to this principle of least privilege\n\n69\n00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.698\nbecause if it's too restrictive\nthey can't do the job.\n\n70\n00:03:58.698 --> 00:04:01.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; If it's too much, they learn how to do\n\n71\n00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.400\ntheir job another way rather than the way\ngranted the actual authority that there\n\n72\n00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.250\nare supposed to have or the authorization\nthat they are supposed to have.\n\n73\n00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.890\nSo it does really help when you start\nactually implementing everything together.\n\n74\n00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.220\nNow Cherokee if we go back to your list\nthat you're looking at there were a lot\n\n75\n00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.940\nmore than this, but there's kind of\ninteresting question what we started.\n\n76\n00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so on the next thing that\nwe wanna go ahead to take a look at\n\n77\n00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.290\nhere is separation of duties.\n\n78\n00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.620\nAnd this is another way\nthat we can go ahead and\n\n79\n00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.850\njust really control the security\nwithin our environment.\n\n80\n00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.670\nSo, one of these concepts is\nsomething called an IM of IN control.\n\n81\n00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.390\nSo let's say I had five people\nworking in my IT department.\n\n82\n00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.440\nMaybe in order to go ahead and\nperform some kind of function, I would\n\n83\n00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.010\nneed at least 50% of those employees\nwithin that department to be present.\n\n84\n00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.310\nSo I could say three,\nat least three of them, had to be present.\n\n85\n00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.550\nIf I had five in my department to\ngo ahead and implement something.\n\n86\n00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.060\nMaybe I'm extracting encryption keys.\n\n87\n00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.310\nOr a good example would be let's\nsay I have a hardware failure for\n\n88\n00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.340\na server and I needed to go ahead and\nrevert back and pull my backups in.\n\n89\n00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.560\nSo I really want to go ahead and\nseparate this concept out and\n\n90\n00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.570\nhave different people\nperform those backups.\n\n91\n00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.589\nAnd I say this, and I do realize some of\nyou guys might be working in environment's\n\n92\n00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.460\nwe don't have that many\npeople in our department.\n\n93\n00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.090\nWell, this is an ideal situation.\n\n94\n00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.910\nYou would want someone\nperforming those backups and\n\n95\n00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.090\na different person restoring them, or at\nleast 50% of your IT department present.\n\n96\n00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.170\nAnd the reason we would want\nto go ahead and do this is so\n\n97\n00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.830\nthat we can't say you know what?\n\n98\n00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.920\nRonnie went ahead and\n\n99\n00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.230\nimplemented those backups last night\nwhen he was here all by himself.\n\n100\n00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.240\nI really think Ronnie was trying to cover\nup some shady stuff because we don't\n\n101\n00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.090\nreally know why that server were to crash,\nor something like that.\n\n102\n00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.760\nSo you always want to be translucent\nwith your environment or end user,\n\n103\n00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.670\nso it doesn't ever put that\nliability on your department there.\n\n104\n00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.070\n&gt;&gt; The other thing about separation\nof duties that really helps us out in\n\n105\n00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.630\nthe realm of security as well,\n\n106\n00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.520\nis that it means that one person doesn't\nalso have access to everything, right?\n\n107\n00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.630\nAnd you might be wondering\nlike why is this important?\n\n108\n00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.170\nAs an organization grows,\nyou do need separation,\n\n109\n00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.000\nyou do need some of these things to help\nyou with the idea of accountability.\n\n110\n00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.180\nWhen one person ends up being able to do\neverything and one person only depends on.\n\n111\n00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.070\nLet me put it differently.\n\n112\n00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.554\nWhen everybody depends on that one person,\nwell.\n\n113\n00:06:30.554 --> 00:06:31.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What\n\n114\n00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.100\nends up happening is that that person\nnow has created his own domain.\n\n115\n00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.860\nWhere nobody else is\nable to step into that.\n\n116\n00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.680\nSo let me share a story with\nyou in how this happened.\n\n117\n00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.070\nSo I've done some database training\ndown at an insurance company before.\n\n118\n00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.385\nAnd the reason why they needed\nthe database training is because they\n\n119\n00:06:50.385 --> 00:06:54.530\ndidnt' know how to create these very\nsimple databases that they needed.\n\n120\n00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.140\nAnd that was because the individual\nthat had done all of this, it was one\n\n121\n00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:03.270\nindividual and then it came time for\nthat review or whatever it was and\n\n122\n00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:07.030\nhe demanded whatever he demanded and\nthe company said, we can't pay you that.\n\n123\n00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.770\nHe left and\nsaid you're going to regret this!\n\n124\n00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.430\nWhy were they going to regret it?\n\n125\n00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.320\nBecause he was the only one that\nknew how to create those databases.\n\n126\n00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.380\nWell, in that creation of the databases,\nthey all depended on him to do it.\n\n127\n00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.630\nCuz once they said that he was\nthe only one that could do it,\n\n128\n00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.070\nwell, now that's where they had\nissues is that he was the only one\n\n129\n00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.720\nthat was being the lynch\npin behind everything.\n\n130\n00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.130\nNow, that's a very simple example and in\nthat sense where everybody is dependent.\n\n131\n00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.140\nWhile instead what should have probably\nhappened is that multiple people should\n\n132\n00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.475\nhave been distributed in terms\nof being able to do that.\n\n133\n00:07:40.475 --> 00:07:44.290\nAnd that way the load was not only on one\nindividual to know how everything works,\n\n134\n00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.950\nbut everybody now understood or\nat least a few people understood it.\n\n135\n00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.500\nWhere not one person isn't\nthe lynch pin to everything.\n\n136\n00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.736\nAnd as your organization grows you need\nthat, you need that idea of separation.\n\n137\n00:07:54.736 --> 00:07:58.096\nYou can still do cross training,\ndon't get me wrong that's a good thing for\n\n138\n00:07:58.096 --> 00:07:58.629\nus to have.\n\n139\n00:07:58.629 --> 00:08:03.680\nOr job rotation, but\nthe idea here is fairly simple, right.\n\n140\n00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.710\nIs that once you separate it out you\ncan now have that accountability, and\n\n141\n00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.576\nit allows you to say here is\nwhat you should be doing.\n\n142\n00:08:10.576 --> 00:08:15.232\nCherokee why are you actually running\na restore program when you're actually\n\n143\n00:08:15.232 --> 00:08:17.690\nsupposed to be just doing backups.\n\n144\n00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.870\nWell, I can't say that\nif I don't have that.\n\n145\n00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.180\nCherokee just says, no,\nI'm just trying to help out.\n\n146\n00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:26.520\nAnd at that point there is a procedure, or\na control, that we can put in place and\n\n147\n00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.250\nsay, Cherokee as much as we appreciate you\ndoing that, you shouldn't be doing it.\n\n148\n00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:31.430\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and so\n\n149\n00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.280\nthis is really part of that authorization.\n\n150\n00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.090\nIf she's not authorized to do so, then\nshe shouldn't be doing it unless there is\n\n151\n00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.920\nspecial authorization giving\nher the privilege to do so.\n\n152\n00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:45.820\nAnd so it is a very important concept\nthat you will have in growing companies,\n\n153\n00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.360\nor in big companies already.\n\n154\n00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.180\nAnd it's not just so they can\nseparate off their own domain, but\n\n155\n00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.600\nit is that accountability.\n\n156\n00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.780\nIt's that idea of everything\nthat has to go on\n\n157\n00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.390\nto keep security as\ncomplete as it needs to be.\n\n158\n00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.380\nSo it is a very important concept.\n\n159\n00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.890\nAll right, Cherokee, what is next\non the list that you have there?\n\n160\n00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.460\n&gt;&gt; Next we have ACLs,\naccess control lists.\n\n161\n00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.930\nBut I just wanted to add to that, Ronnie,\n\n162\n00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:15.420\nthat unfortunately that story that you\ntold us here happens all too frequently,\n\n163\n00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:20.030\nand by the time companies go\nthrough the legal process,\n\n164\n00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.150\nto go ahead and get the information\nthat that person was withholding.\n\n165\n00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.680\nIt could be past the point\nof that information\n\n166\n00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.670\neven being relevant to\nthat organization anymore.\n\n167\n00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.150\nSo to really prevent yourself,\n\n168\n00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:36.060\ndefinitely listen to what Ronnie had to\nsay about that separation of duty there.\n\n169\n00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.301\nAnd things like using cross training,\njob rotation,\n\n170\n00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:41.630\nit just makes you a stronger employee.\n\n171\n00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.935\nAnd you don't have that one person\njust controlling all the power.\n\n172\n00:09:44.935 --> 00:09:45.810\nAnd it's kinda funny,\n\n173\n00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:49.660\nbecause I've met people along the way\nlike that as well and they're out there.\n\n174\n00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.340\nIt's a very unethical,\nor unmoral, thing to do,\n\n175\n00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.260\nbut that's just kind of\nthe nature of the game.\n\n176\n00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.910\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n177\n00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:01.150\nBut yeah, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at ACL's access control list.\n\n178\n00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.770\nI have a server set up here if\ni can go ahead and find it.\n\n179\n00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.170\nAccess control list,\nit's a very simple idea.\n\n180\n00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.660\nDon't take it deeper than\nwhat it really needs to be.\n\n181\n00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:15.420\nIt simply means we're controlling\nwho has access based upon,\n\n182\n00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.670\nwell, lists, access control lists.\n\n183\n00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:22.039\nSo you can see ACLs being\nimplemented in a number of ways.\n\n184\n00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:27.205\nACLs can be implemented via firewall\nsettings, via wireless access control,\n\n185\n00:10:27.205 --> 00:10:32.980\naccess points, okay, setting MAC\nfiltering, MAC limiting, things like that.\n\n186\n00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.372\nWe can use permissions.\n\n187\n00:10:34.372 --> 00:10:36.680\nI wanna show you guys here\non this particular folder.\n\n188\n00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.410\nI just created some random folder here.\n\n189\n00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:39.478\nLet me go ahead and log on.\n\n190\n00:10:39.478 --> 00:10:40.915\nAll right.\n\n191\n00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:50.186\nAll right, so if we look at my screen here\nwe can see that I have just a mock folder\n\n192\n00:10:50.186 --> 00:10:52.938\nhere that I've created,\nand I can go ahead and\n\n193\n00:10:52.938 --> 00:10:57.570\nimplement a form of access control by\nutilizing my integrated permissions.\n\n194\n00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.900\nSo let's just go ahead and\nzoom in a little bit here.\n\n195\n00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.490\nAnd we can click on the Security tab.\n\n196\n00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.986\nLet me move it over so you can see\nwhat's happening and it's not behind me.\n\n197\n00:11:06.986 --> 00:11:09.975\nUnder Security,\n\n198\n00:11:09.975 --> 00:11:13.880\nand let's say I hire Ronnie, and\nI wanna go ahead and restrict or\n\n199\n00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.390\ngrant Ronnie permissions accordingly to\nthis particular folder, I could do so.\n\n200\n00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:19.760\nBy clicking this Edit button.\n\n201\n00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.220\nAll right and hit Add.\n\n202\n00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.460\nNow, I've already entered Ronnie into\nactive directory so I just go ahead and\n\n203\n00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.150\nstart my search here.\n\n204\n00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.899\nI can type in a few letters and\nthen go ahead and hit for Check Names.\n\n205\n00:11:37.438 --> 00:11:39.680\nCheck Names, there we go.\n\n206\n00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.020\nAnd once it's underlined, you can go\nahead and see that he's already in.\n\n207\n00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.860\nI make sure I'm spelling it properly,\nand that's the Ronnie I'm looking for.\n\n208\n00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.900\nSo I go ahead and select OK.\n\n209\n00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.910\nAnd then, currently,\n\n210\n00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:54.750\nI have my basic permissions that\nWindows has selected for me.\n\n211\n00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.460\nBut let's say we wanna give Ronnie,\n\n212\n00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:00.740\ncurrently he's at read, to list the folder\ncontents, and read and execute.\n\n213\n00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.030\nBut you know what, I want Ronnie to\nmake sure he has complete control,\n\n214\n00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.600\nit's nothing too secretive here.\n\n215\n00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.750\nSo let's just go ahead and\ngive Ronnie full control.\n\n216\n00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.480\nGo ahead and hit OK and OK.\n\n217\n00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.110\nAnd you know what, that's actually just\nanother example of access control lists.\n\n218\n00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:20.100\nSo it's a very generic, or\nalmost like an umbrella term.\n\n219\n00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.290\nSo don't get too caught up in that.\n\n220\n00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.250\n&gt;&gt; Now Cherokee, this really does tie\nin nicely with something that we had\n\n221\n00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:31.350\nmentioned in a previous episode, which is\nthe idea of single sign on authentication.\n\n222\n00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:35.616\nWhen we actually have the single sign on,\nthe way that we control access to those\n\n223\n00:12:35.616 --> 00:12:38.290\nresources is not by adding\nanother password, but\n\n224\n00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:42.812\ninstead, with that particular user account\nthat she showed you, my user account,\n\n225\n00:12:42.812 --> 00:12:46.504\nwhat she can now do is go ahead and\nsay, with this particular folder,\n\n226\n00:12:46.504 --> 00:12:49.810\nhere's the level of access\nRonnie is going to have.\n\n227\n00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.410\nThen we can go to another server and\n\n228\n00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.830\nthe same thing where I am\nnow added into a group, and\n\n229\n00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:58.703\nthat particular entire group has\na certain level of permissions as well.\n\n230\n00:12:58.703 --> 00:13:02.540\nSo instead of having to have every single\none of those where I have a different\n\n231\n00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.340\npassword for every single one-\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n232\n00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.580\n&gt;&gt; It implements nicely.\n\n233\n00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.590\nSo access control list and\n\n234\n00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:12.180\nthe idea of authentication inside of\na domain, that is where single sign on\n\n235\n00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.130\nreally does show its power\n&gt;&gt; Benefits.\n\n236\n00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.850\n&gt;&gt; And control, and benefit,\nlike you were talking about.\n\n237\n00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:21.870\nSo Cherokee what else do we need to\ntake a look at when it comes down to\n\n238\n00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.050\nauthorization?\n\n239\n00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:26.515\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so if I just have Ronnie for\nthat one particular folder,\n\n240\n00:13:26.515 --> 00:13:30.275\nthat's a lot of work if I were to go ahead\nand do that for every individual employee.\n\n241\n00:13:30.275 --> 00:13:33.525\nSo Ronnie mentioned groups,\nwhich I'm gonna show you in a few minutes.\n\n242\n00:13:33.525 --> 00:13:37.130\nBut I do wanna explain a couple of\ndifferent approaches that you can take\n\n243\n00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:41.240\nwhen you're setting up groups and\ndifferent types of access control methods.\n\n244\n00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.810\nSo the first one I wanna go ahead and\n\n245\n00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.545\nmention here is called MAC,\nmandatory access control.\n\n246\n00:13:46.545 --> 00:13:49.790\nDon't get that confused with MAC\naddresses, or anything like that, but\n\n247\n00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:55.190\nmandatory access control is a simple\nconcept that basically dictates that\n\n248\n00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:58.840\nmy permissions are gonna\nbe based upon policies and\n\n249\n00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.400\nrestrictions that have\nalready been set forth.\n\n250\n00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.630\nOkay, so mandatory access controls,\nI have policies that i must adhere to for\n\n251\n00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:10.922\nmy particular folders and\ncomponents within my organization.\n\n252\n00:14:10.922 --> 00:14:16.120\nThat would be different from\ndiscretionary access control.\n\n253\n00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.445\nDiscretionary is a really informal method,\nor approach, that I can use.\n\n254\n00:14:20.445 --> 00:14:26.620\nLet's say I have a startup company and I'm\nactually just running it out of my garage.\n\n255\n00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:31.060\nI have three employees, they're three of\nmy best friends that I've known forever.\n\n256\n00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.130\nSo I really trust them,\nI don't have to worry too much.\n\n257\n00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:35.110\nI might wanna go ahead and\n\n258\n00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:40.180\nimplement this kind of access control\nmethod because discretionary is, well,\n\n259\n00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:46.720\nbased upon the discretion of that owner,\nor creator, of that particular object.\n\n260\n00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.220\nSo I just created that folder, okay.\n\n261\n00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:51.080\nThat demo folder that I showed you.\n\n262\n00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.290\nSo now I'm the one who can say,\nyep, Ronnie has control, okay.\n\n263\n00:14:55.290 --> 00:15:00.430\nOr if Ronnie created the folder, he could\ngo ahead and delineate who has control\n\n264\n00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:04.310\nover that, or who can write and\nadd objects to that particular folder.\n\n265\n00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:09.180\nCompletely opposite from mandatory access\ncontrol, where I have an IT department,\n\n266\n00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.830\nor the IT department is kind\nof more of just the enforcers.\n\n267\n00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.840\nWhereas upper management would say,\n\n268\n00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.840\nlook, this person's allowed this control,\nso forth.\n\n269\n00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.500\nAnd then the IT department would need to\nactually enforce mandatory access control.\n\n270\n00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.030\n&gt;&gt; When we start taking a look\nat both of these concepts,\n\n271\n00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:28.270\nthey're really great concepts that you\ndefinitely need to make sure that you have\n\n272\n00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:31.120\nclear in your mind before\nyou take the exam.\n\n273\n00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.220\nSo an example of something like\nmandatory access control also\n\n274\n00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.780\nis when we set up\na security level instead.\n\n275\n00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.870\nIn other words, a particular rule.\n\n276\n00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:43.790\nSo if you've ever heard of the term\ntop secret, or confidential, or\n\n277\n00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:48.723\nanything like that, well, we're not saying\nthat it's a user's prerogative here or\n\n278\n00:15:48.723 --> 00:15:51.241\ntheir user account that gives them access.\n\n279\n00:15:51.241 --> 00:15:55.731\nWhat we're actually saying is if they\ndon't have that particular tag with their\n\n280\n00:15:55.731 --> 00:16:00.236\naccount, well, then they don't get access\nto it, regardless of who they are.\n\n281\n00:16:00.236 --> 00:16:03.745\nIf they have to meet that certain\nlevel of that requirement in terms of\n\n282\n00:16:03.745 --> 00:16:04.780\nmandatory access.\n\n283\n00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.220\nAnd that's what we\nare normally taking a look at.\n\n284\n00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.658\nIn discretionary access control,\nanother example,\n\n285\n00:16:09.658 --> 00:16:11.358\nwhich Cherokee started to point out.\n\n286\n00:16:11.358 --> 00:16:14.645\nI wasn't sure if she was going to, so\nI'm going to make sure that she did,\n\n287\n00:16:14.645 --> 00:16:17.920\nis the access control list that\nshe did show you on that photo.\n\n288\n00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.380\nIs a form of also discretionary access\n\n289\n00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:20.970\ncontrol, because-\n&gt;&gt; Yup\n\n290\n00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:22.350\n&gt;&gt; it means she picks.\n\n291\n00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:23.740\n&gt;&gt; I choose.\n&gt;&gt; Gets on the list.\n\n292\n00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:24.540\n&gt;&gt; The owner chooses.\n\n293\n00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.010\n&gt;&gt; The owner chooses,\nso it is the same way.\n\n294\n00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:29.250\nI like using movies as a concept.\n\n295\n00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.910\nIt's always that weird funny\nmovie that you have where\n\n296\n00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.800\nit's guys trying to get into the club,\nright.\n\n297\n00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.340\nAnd the bouncer at the door says,\nnope you're not on the list.\n\n298\n00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.470\n&gt;&gt; Night at the Roxbury or something.\n\n299\n00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.465\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Night at Roxbury or\nsomething like that.\n\n300\n00:16:41.465 --> 00:16:43.390\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But whatever movie it is, right.\n\n301\n00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:47.530\nIt's the bouncer that says, hey, you're\nnot on the list and you don't get in.\n\n302\n00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:51.650\nWell that's another aspect or another\nexample of discretionary access control.\n\n303\n00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.930\nAnd inside of our networks when\nwe use something like that,\n\n304\n00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.000\nthe ACL's that you were talking about.\n\n305\n00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.150\nThat is a discretionary access control,\nbecause we can say who is and who isn't.\n\n306\n00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:05.570\nMandatory access control again, top\nsecret is a good example of those things.\n\n307\n00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:10.040\n&gt;&gt; It, it's a perfect example, because in\nny little start-up company in my garage.\n\n308\n00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:15.540\nUnless I'm dealing with any kind of\nregulatory compliances like HIPA or\n\n309\n00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.170\nsomething like that.\n\n310\n00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.880\nBut hopefully, I'm not running\nanything like that in my garage, but\n\n311\n00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.360\nI don't have those rules to follow.\n\n312\n00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:25.290\nWhereas mandatory, look,\nI can't talk my way into.\n\n313\n00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:25.835\nWell.\n\n314\n00:17:25.835 --> 00:17:27.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You hope not.\n\n315\n00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I hope not.\n\n316\n00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:30.100\nI shouldn't be able to go ahead and\n\n317\n00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.835\ntalk my way into viewing top secret\ndocuments within the military.\n\n318\n00:17:33.835 --> 00:17:36.125\nWith a concept of\nmandatory access control.\n\n319\n00:17:36.125 --> 00:17:40.385\nSo, that's a really good example there,\njust completely different concepts, but\n\n320\n00:17:40.385 --> 00:17:41.885\nyou do need to know both.\n\n321\n00:17:41.885 --> 00:17:46.295\nAnd another one that we need to look\nat is, role-based access control.\n\n322\n00:17:46.295 --> 00:17:48.995\nNow in a corporate environment,\nI might want to go ahead and\n\n323\n00:17:48.995 --> 00:17:50.265\nuse role-based access control.\n\n324\n00:17:50.265 --> 00:17:54.880\nBecause it's very, very common, because\nit just, well, it logically makes sense.\n\n325\n00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.840\nSo, I can go ahead an segment my network\nand let's say, my sales department.\n\n326\n00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:05.210\nThey access a lot of the same resources on\na day to day functions to their job roles.\n\n327\n00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.680\nBut they don't need to go ahead and\n\n328\n00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.290\naccess my important cooperate financials\nin the accounting department.\n\n329\n00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.890\nSo, by sending up groups and\n\n330\n00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.450\nI can show you how to do that here,\nI can really control.\n\n331\n00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:18.020\nLook, Ronnie works in sales.\n\n332\n00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:22.183\nHe does not need access to\neverything in accounting, so\n\n333\n00:18:22.183 --> 00:18:26.294\nI'm going to implement\nrole-based access control.\n\n334\n00:18:26.294 --> 00:18:28.320\nSo now, we've talked about role-based.\n\n335\n00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.180\nwe've talked about discretionary and\nmandatory.\n\n336\n00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:36.720\nTwo of the three are the same [LAUGH] and\nthey fall under one other category.\n\n337\n00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:41.280\nCan you pick out which two are more\nsimilar, or more alike than the other?\n\n338\n00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.200\nWell, I'll go ahead and tell you.\n\n339\n00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.980\nIt's going to be mandatory access\ncontrol and role-based access control.\n\n340\n00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:52.563\nAnd that's because both of those\nmethods are what we call rule-based\n\n341\n00:18:52.563 --> 00:18:54.090\naccess methods.\n\n342\n00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:59.230\nBecause policies and rules have been\ncreated to govern who has access.\n\n343\n00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:02.770\nDiscretionary is just very haphazard and\nit really doesn't matter.\n\n344\n00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:07.410\nSo, those two fall under that category\nwhen you hear role based access control.\n\n345\n00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:08.350\nAnd if we look at my screen,\n\n346\n00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:13.530\nI can just show you how nice\nActive Directory, and easy.\n\n347\n00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:16.600\nIt makes us to go ahead and\nimplement that.\n\n348\n00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.060\nIf we pull up Server Manager.\n\n349\n00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.720\nI'm just running Server 2012 R2 here.\n\n350\n00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.620\nGo under Tools.\n\n351\n00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:25.420\nNow, I've previously installed\nmy Active Directory roles here.\n\n352\n00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:30.799\nSo, I can just go under Users and\nComputers, And\n\n353\n00:19:30.799 --> 00:19:35.900\nif I zoom in here, you guys can see this.\n\n354\n00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:41.880\nThe little icon with two people here\nis going to be delineating a group.\n\n355\n00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.120\nWhenever I scroll down and\nI added Ronnie in here earlier.\n\n356\n00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:48.780\nThere he is, Ronnie,\ndown here at the bottom.\n\n357\n00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.220\nJust one little person icon\nnext to his name there.\n\n358\n00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.520\nThat just means an individual user.\n\n359\n00:19:54.520 --> 00:20:00.930\nSo, I could just go ahead and right click\nand select to go ahead and create a new.\n\n360\n00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:02.400\nAnd I'm going off the screen here.\n\n361\n00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.340\nLet me scroll over.\n\n362\n00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.750\nAll right, new computer, contact, group.\n\n363\n00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.040\nThere are a couple of different\nways within the server.\n\n364\n00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.130\nThey make it really easy to go ahead and\ndo that, but\n\n365\n00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:14.650\nlet's say Ronny was already listed here.\n\n366\n00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.400\nLet's go ahead and create a new group.\n\n367\n00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.048\nWhat were you assigned to, sales?\n\n368\n00:20:18.048 --> 00:20:22.690\nAll right, Ronnie works in sales and\nnotice we also have\n\n369\n00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:26.160\nthe option here to go ahead and\ntype what kind of group scope it is.\n\n370\n00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.640\nOr, if it's a security group or\ndistribution group.\n\n371\n00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.685\nIf you're ever in doubt,\nalways go with security.\n\n372\n00:20:33.685 --> 00:20:37.275\nBecause distribution groups\ncannot have any kind of\n\n373\n00:20:37.275 --> 00:20:42.475\npolicies GPOs attached to them and\nsecurity groups can.\n\n374\n00:20:42.475 --> 00:20:44.405\nAnd distribution groups can be used for\n\n375\n00:20:44.405 --> 00:20:49.575\nemail distribution lists, but security\ngroups can be used for that as well.\n\n376\n00:20:49.575 --> 00:20:52.790\nSo when in doubt, go with security.\n\n377\n00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:55.340\nAll right, so\nwe've created a new sales group here and\n\n378\n00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.520\nyou can see it's just been added.\n\n379\n00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.290\nWell, there are a couple different\nways to go ahead and add Ronnie.\n\n380\n00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:03.130\nWe could go ahead and\nclick on Ronnie's profile and then,\n\n381\n00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.030\ngo to the members of group.\n\n382\n00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:05.550\nAnd currently,\n\n383\n00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:09.680\nbecause he is domain member,\nhe by default gets added to this group.\n\n384\n00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.270\nNow, we want to go ahead and give Ronnie\naccess to all of our sales resources.\n\n385\n00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.410\nSo we'll go ahead and add him, all right.\n\n386\n00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:21.270\nWe'll type in sales and check names just\nto make sure we got the right one here.\n\n387\n00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.130\nHit check names and\nonce it becomes underlined,\n\n388\n00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.400\nwe'll go ahead and add him, okay.\n\n389\n00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.740\nIt's acting weird here, but\nlet me see if you guys can see that.\n\n390\n00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:35.160\nThat it's underlined and\nwe'll go ahead and select OK.\n\n391\n00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:39.480\nAnd now, we can see that Ronnie is a part\nof not only the domain user's group, but\n\n392\n00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.790\nhe is now part other sales group as well.\n\n393\n00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.770\nAnd since we are already\nin Active Directory,\n\n394\n00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:48.100\nI'll only show you another thing here.\n\n395\n00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:52.120\nWe can go ahead and\ndo something with Ronnie's account.\n\n396\n00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.030\nMaybe Ronnie is hired to only\nwork Monday through Friday.\n\n397\n00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:58.600\nSo to prevent Ronnie from\ncoming in on the weekend and\n\n398\n00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.110\nworking when he really shouldn't be,\nall right.\n\n399\n00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:05.800\nWe can go under his account and\nthis is going to be under the Account tab.\n\n400\n00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.780\nAnd you'll notice there's a section\nhere that says Log On Hours, so\n\n401\n00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:14.230\nwe can actually implement time\nof day restrictions for Ronnie.\n\n402\n00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:16.290\nI could do this and\ngo through every single day and\n\n403\n00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:19.500\nsay look,\nRonnie only works from 9 AM to 5 PM.\n\n404\n00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.110\nSo we can go ahead and block him out, yes.\n\n405\n00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:22.980\n[LAUGH] Right?\n\n406\n00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.855\nOr if I know that Ronnie always\nhas off on the weekends.\n\n407\n00:22:25.855 --> 00:22:29.420\nSo, you just click on\nthe little box here and\n\n408\n00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.990\nchange this radio button from\nlogon permitted to logon denied.\n\n409\n00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:36.950\nWhich this is nice also,\nbecause if an attacker was trying to\n\n410\n00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:40.680\nrun a brut force attack,\na password attack on Ronnie.\n\n411\n00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.310\nIt would even prevent him completely\nfrom any kind of off hours to be able to\n\n412\n00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:45.012\nlog on here.\n\n413\n00:22:45.012 --> 00:22:49.905\nNow, ou can go through and set this\nindividually for each end user, but\n\n414\n00:22:49.905 --> 00:22:53.065\nlet's say the whole sales\nteam had off on the weekends.\n\n415\n00:22:53.065 --> 00:22:56.265\nWell, I could go ahead and create a group\npolicy and implement it to everyone, so\n\n416\n00:22:56.265 --> 00:22:57.635\nI'd only have to do that once.\n\n417\n00:22:57.635 --> 00:23:00.355\nSo that just shows you the ease of\n\n418\n00:23:00.355 --> 00:23:05.470\naccess that active directory really brings\nto these concepts that we have here.\n\n419\n00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:08.280\n&gt;&gt; And time of day restrictions,\neven though this is an easy way for\n\n420\n00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.815\nus to do this across an organization.\n\n421\n00:23:09.815 --> 00:23:12.978\nIt's something that we should\nthink about on a regular basis.\n\n422\n00:23:12.978 --> 00:23:16.370\nWhether we're talking about just\nimplementing some type of security policy\n\n423\n00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:17.960\nor we have a way of enforcing it.\n\n424\n00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.870\nWe can do this of course,\nwith physical access control.\n\n425\n00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.700\nSuch as, inside of our building here.\n\n426\n00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.290\nIf we know that there are certain\nindividuals that shouldn't be here over\n\n427\n00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:26.190\nthe weekend.\n\n428\n00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:29.090\nWell, we can program it to where\nthe doors will not unlock for\n\n429\n00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:31.790\nthem to be able to gain access in as well.\n\n430\n00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:34.690\nSo, we can have all these things in place.\n\n431\n00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:37.800\nNow, I also want to mention a couple of\nexamples that Cherokee was talking about,\n\n432\n00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.720\nin terms of rule based\nversus role based as well.\n\n433\n00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.820\nIn the rule based,\n\n434\n00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:46.060\nwhen Cherokee mentioned earlier the idea\nof setting up rules like firewall rules.\n\n435\n00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:49.720\nWell, that's a good example\nof a rule-based type of\n\n436\n00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.860\naccess control that you can think about.\n\n437\n00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.616\nIn role-based,\nthe idea of creating a group and\n\n438\n00:23:54.616 --> 00:23:57.249\nsaying this particular\nrole has access here.\n\n439\n00:23:57.249 --> 00:23:59.742\nWell, that is a difference as well, okay.\n\n440\n00:23:59.742 --> 00:24:03.448\nSo those are also examples that we\ndefinitely need to pay attention to.\n\n441\n00:24:03.448 --> 00:24:07.228\nWhen we think about the idea\nof authorization, too, okay?\n\n442\n00:24:07.228 --> 00:24:10.918\nSo it's very important that we actually\nunderstand those differences on each of\n\n443\n00:24:10.918 --> 00:24:12.800\nthose that we've talked about.\n\n444\n00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.480\nBut, Cherokee, is there anything else\nthat we need to think about here?\n\n445\n00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.275\n&gt;&gt; There is, there's one more topic.\n\n446\n00:24:17.275 --> 00:24:20.268\nWe've mentioned it in a different episode,\nbut\n\n447\n00:24:20.268 --> 00:24:22.898\nCompTIA specifically calls it out again.\n\n448\n00:24:22.898 --> 00:24:26.247\nSo if that's any kind of clue to you,\nobviously it's important, so\n\n449\n00:24:26.247 --> 00:24:27.780\nwe need to take a look at it.\n\n450\n00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:31.820\nSo let's go ahead and hop onto my screen\nhere, and I just wanna show you something.\n\n451\n00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.260\nThis is just a random,\nI think it's a new site, digg.com.\n\n452\n00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:40.320\nI don't have account here, but if I\nwanted to go ahead and create an account,\n\n453\n00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.180\nI wouldn't even have to go ahead and\ntype in all of my information.\n\n454\n00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.840\nHow convenient, right?\n\n455\n00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.359\nIf I had a Twitter account or\na Facebook account or a Google account,\n\n456\n00:24:48.359 --> 00:24:51.840\nI could just go go ahead and\nclick one of these provided icons.\n\n457\n00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.387\nAnd all I did was I went to their\nhomepage and I clicked on, yeah.\n\n458\n00:24:54.387 --> 00:24:57.152\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Lovely picture.\n\n459\n00:24:57.152 --> 00:25:00.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] SIGN IN or\nSIGN UP, click right here.\n\n460\n00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.183\nAnd that's where I got to this page.\n\n461\n00:25:02.183 --> 00:25:06.280\nAnd let's say I'm gonna go ahead and\nsign in with Facebook, all right?\n\n462\n00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.970\nSo they ask me to go ahead and\nlog in with my Facebook credentials.\n\n463\n00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:13.370\nSo this is an example here\nof our transitive trust.\n\n464\n00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.140\nSometimes you'll hear federated trust.\n\n465\n00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.105\nIt just depends on how it sets up.\n\n466\n00:25:17.105 --> 00:25:21.265\nNow I'm only inputting my email or phone\nnumber and my password to go ahead and\n\n467\n00:25:21.265 --> 00:25:23.380\nauthenticate to create this account.\n\n468\n00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:30.534\nDifferent websites have different levels\nof access or information that they share.\n\n469\n00:25:30.534 --> 00:25:33.512\nSo let's say I'm logging into my,\n\n470\n00:25:33.512 --> 00:25:38.192\nthis Digg site could be\nconsidered a service provider.\n\n471\n00:25:38.192 --> 00:25:41.720\nThey're providing me with a service,\nreading articles.\n\n472\n00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:46.640\nAnd I would need to go ahead and\naccess that with this third party.\n\n473\n00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:51.180\nBut maybe I don't want Digg to know all\nof my personal contacts that I have on\n\n474\n00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.920\nFacebook and things like that.\n\n475\n00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.610\nSo from a security standpoint, and, like I\nsaid, we've talked about this before, but\n\n476\n00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:59.690\nyou just wanna be careful when\nyou're using services like this.\n\n477\n00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.480\nAnd know that there is\na possibility that the way,\n\n478\n00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.240\nthere might even be\nvulnerabilities in the coding with\n\n479\n00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.740\nthe APIs between the way that these\ntwo websites are communicating.\n\n480\n00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:16.500\nSo there's a lot more risks, I guess,\ninvolved with this type of connection.\n\n481\n00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:21.385\nActually, when this concept first came\nout, they were storing the passwords in\n\n482\n00:26:21.385 --> 00:26:25.470\ndatabases that were being\nhacked into easily.\n\n483\n00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:30.970\nAnd so instead they switched over to more\nlike a hashing method so that people\n\n484\n00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:34.550\nwouldn't be able to just have access\nto all these usernames and passwords.\n\n485\n00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.640\nSo just keep that in mind also.\n\n486\n00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:41.110\n&gt;&gt; Remember that the concept that we have\nhere, right, is that transitive trust.\n\n487\n00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:44.740\nAnd the way that Cherokee showed us is\nthat the way that we gain access to Digg\n\n488\n00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:48.086\nis not because we have some\ntype of account in Digg.\n\n489\n00:26:48.086 --> 00:26:52.190\nIt's that Digg says,\nI trust your Facebook account,\n\n490\n00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:56.460\nwhich means now they have\naccess through your Facebook.\n\n491\n00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:59.800\nAnd that means that Digg itself could go\nin the way that Cherokee described it.\n\n492\n00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:04.700\nAnd now see more information because\nyou chose to use Facebook as your\n\n493\n00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:06.180\nauthentication.\n\n494\n00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.760\nAnd that now establishes\nthat trust between them.\n\n495\n00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.510\nSo it can go two ways when you do that,\nand that's where the problem comes in.\n\n496\n00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:17.013\nIt might reveal more information about you\nthan if you actually had that ability to\n\n497\n00:27:17.013 --> 00:27:18.459\ngo directly only to Digg.\n\n498\n00:27:18.459 --> 00:27:20.356\nWhich I don't know if you do or not,\n\n499\n00:27:20.356 --> 00:27:23.370\ncuz it was like ten years since\nthe last time I read Digg.\n\n500\n00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:28.170\nBut you can go into Digg and\nbe able to sign up on your own instead.\n\n501\n00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:31.420\nSo that way, you don't reveal everything\nabout every single contact that you have\n\n502\n00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:35.388\nin your Facebook account if you're\nkind of concerned about that as well.\n\n503\n00:27:35.388 --> 00:27:37.630\nOkay, so, Cherokee, what else do we have?\n\n504\n00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:38.920\n&gt;&gt; Just one other thing, guys.\n\n505\n00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.670\nJust note that we were looking\nat the public infrastructure\n\n506\n00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:43.690\nrunning over the Internet\nwith this website Digg.\n\n507\n00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:46.200\nBut you can also implement\nfederated trusts and\n\n508\n00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.470\ntransitive trusts internally\nwithin your own organization.\n\n509\n00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:55.150\nAnd that's implemented through, well it\ncan be implemented in a number of ways.\n\n510\n00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:57.324\nI'm kind of stuck in\nMicrosoft land sometimes.\n\n511\n00:27:57.324 --> 00:27:59.778\nAnd especially if you're studying for\nthose exams,\n\n512\n00:27:59.778 --> 00:28:01.570\nyou will need to know about that also.\n\n513\n00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:04.920\nSo don't just think it's only\napplicable in a public environment.\n\n514\n00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.530\nBut you can implement that same\nconcept internally as well.\n\n515\n00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.260\n&gt;&gt; And there's no doubt,\nCherokee, that there's a lot of\n\n516\n00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.570\ndifferent information that we need\nto know about access control.\n\n517\n00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:17.030\nAnd so in this little kind of miniseries\nthat we've had here, we've talked about\n\n518\n00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:21.940\nauthentication as well as the idea\nof authorization and identities.\n\n519\n00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:24.780\nAnd there's a lot of different concepts\nthat you need to be familiar with\n\n520\n00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.560\nbefore you go in and take the exam.\n\n521\n00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.600\nSo please do make sure you review them and\n\n522\n00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.840\nunderstand them thoroughly as\nyou go in to take the exam.\n\n523\n00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.130\nEspecially think about some\nexamples that you can also\n\n524\n00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.770\nput into the context of\nusing what you need to.\n\n525\n00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.770\nTo help fulfill some type\nof requirement as well.\n\n526\n00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:41.720\nThank you, Cherokee, for\n\n527\n00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.120\nhelping us to understand those\nconcepts a little bit better.\n\n528\n00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.070\nThank you also for joining us.\n\n529\n00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:49.680\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Ronnie Wong.\n\n530\n00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.690\n&gt;&gt; And I'm Cherokee Boose.\n\n531\n00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:54.943\n&gt;&gt; Stay tuned right here for\nmore CompTIA Security+.\n\n532\n00:28:54.943 --> 00:29:00.898\n[MUSIC]\n\n533\n00:29:00.898 --> 00:29:04.055\nThank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon, and good evening, and\n\n5\n00:00:37,064 --> 00:00:39,306\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:42,050\nI'm your host Don Pezet back with Mr.\nMike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:42,810\nHow's it going, Mike?\n\n8\n00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,020\n>> Good, good, how are you doing, Don?\n\n9\n00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,260\n>> I am doing just well.\n\n10\n00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,940\nSo I think, well we're doing another\nepisode of security plus today.\n\n11\n00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,630\n>> We are, we are.\n\n12\n00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,805\n>> And I think this is the first episode\nof this one that I've done with you\n\n13\n00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:54,385\nMike, right?\n\n14\n00:00:54,385 --> 00:00:55,340\n>> Yeah, actually it is, isn't it?\n\n15\n00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,925\nCuz I know I've done a couple with\nRonnie and a couple with Nate, I think.\n\n16\n00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:58,735\nSo, yeah.\n\n17\n00:00:58,735 --> 00:01:02,505\n>> So I specifically requested you for\nthis show today.\n\n18\n00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:04,715\nBecause, boy, have we got a line up.\n\n19\n00:01:04,715 --> 00:01:05,455\nWe are.\n\n20\n00:01:05,455 --> 00:01:06,035\n>> Fun stuff.\n\n21\n00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:10,130\n>> Yeah, we are gonna be tackling\ncryptographic standards and\n\n22\n00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,990\nI have my list here which\nis just a ton of things.\n\n23\n00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,560\nWell, here I've got\nthe objectives up on the screen.\n\n24\n00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,390\nLet me just pull these up.\n\n25\n00:01:18,915 --> 00:01:21,003\nThe final section, 6.0, cryptography.\n\n26\n00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:23,165\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It starts out with some really cool\n\n27\n00:01:23,165 --> 00:01:26,345\nstuff, general concepts and things that\nwe need to be aware of for the exam.\n\n28\n00:01:26,345 --> 00:01:28,205\nAnd that's pretty straightforward.\n\n29\n00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:31,940\nIt is good knowledge, easy to learn\nwe'll have some fun talking about it.\n\n30\n00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,644\nBut as the objective continues on,\n\n31\n00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:40,695\nit turns into a laundry list of just all\nthese different encryption standards.\n\n32\n00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:44,625\nAnd we wanna talk about those and not dive\ntoo deep in to them, because on the exam\n\n33\n00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:48,393\nwe really just need to be able to\ndifferentiate between the different ones.\n\n34\n00:01:48,393 --> 00:01:48,999\n>> Right, exactly.\n>> So\n\n35\n00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:51,064\nwe'll cover what we need to know on that,\n\n36\n00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:55,210\nbut I know Mike you've got some really\ngood takes on some of these, so.\n\n37\n00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,265\n>> Yeah, just don't panic.\n\n38\n00:01:56,265 --> 00:01:58,889\nDon't look at that acronym list and\ngo, oh my God.\n\n39\n00:01:58,889 --> 00:02:01,143\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You really don't have to know how each\n\n40\n00:02:01,143 --> 00:02:03,569\none of those algorithms works or\nanything like that.\n\n41\n00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:06,290\nJust some basic facts that we'll share\nwith you about each one of them.\n\n42\n00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,656\n>> All right, so let's dive in to\njust the first part here which,\n\n43\n00:02:09,656 --> 00:02:14,860\nthe official title is, given a scenario,\nutilize general cryptography concepts.\n\n44\n00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,490\nAnd what they're really trying to say\nthere is, there are different tools for\n\n45\n00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:24,070\nwhat you need, and when you need to\nencrypt your data, when you need to apply\n\n46\n00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,170\nsome kind of cryptographic cipher to\nprotect your data, which tool do you use?\n\n47\n00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:28,942\nThere's a lot of stuff.\n\n48\n00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:30,828\n>> A lotta different options\nthat we can choose from.\n\n49\n00:02:30,828 --> 00:02:33,980\nAnd we wanna choose the one that's gonna\ngive us the level of protection we need,\n\n50\n00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,640\nand at the same time, keep our\nperformance acceptable, all right?\n\n51\n00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,380\nAnd not drag our system down and\nslow everything down.\n\n52\n00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,310\n>> Now, so almost every cryptographic\nstandard that we use today works on\n\n53\n00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,200\nthe same principle.\n\n54\n00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,640\nIt works on the idea of having some\nkind of a mathematical algorithm that\n\n55\n00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,550\nwe feed our data through, that translates\nour data into something else, right?\n\n56\n00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,720\nWe call it ciphertext.\n\n57\n00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,660\nIt's a garbled mess that\nif somebody looks at it,\n\n58\n00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,990\nit doesn't make any sense to them, right?\n\n59\n00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:08,740\nBut if they have the proper key,\nthe proper formula and seed values or\n\n60\n00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,200\nwhatever they need, once they have that\ninformation, they can decrypt the data.\n\n61\n00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,740\nThey can reverse the mathematical\nformula that we ran and\n\n62\n00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,210\nput the data back to the way it was and\nthey can read it.\n\n63\n00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:19,743\n>> Exactly.\n\n64\n00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:23,075\n>> And that ensures that only the people\nwe want have access to that data,\n\n65\n00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:26,305\nonly people who have that key have\nthat information, can get at it.\n\n66\n00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:28,227\n>> Exactly,\nsome terms we should be familiar with,\n\n67\n00:03:28,227 --> 00:03:29,522\nwhich you probably already are.\n\n68\n00:03:29,522 --> 00:03:30,782\nIt's some very basic terms.\n\n69\n00:03:30,782 --> 00:03:35,940\nAnd with Don mentioned of cryptography\nis really the art of hiding information.\n\n70\n00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,630\nAnd we can do the term plain text,\nwhich is what we start with.\n\n71\n00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,620\nWhen we run it through\nan encryption algorithm,\n\n72\n00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,360\nwe're converting that plain text and\ndecipher text.\n\n73\n00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,620\nAs Don said,\nyou need a key to decrypt that.\n\n74\n00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,380\nSometimes I think the key is\na confusing concept for people.\n\n75\n00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,580\nIt's not something, obviously, that\nI've got on my key chain in my pocket or\n\n76\n00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,670\nanything like that.\n\n77\n00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,760\nWhen it comes down to it,\n\n78\n00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,490\nthere's not a whole lot of\nalgorithms that we use, right?\n\n79\n00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,370\nThere's a bunch of them.\n\n80\n00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,240\nBut there's a limited number of them.\n\n81\n00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,820\nAnd we all end up using\nthe same algorithms.\n\n82\n00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,060\nAnd if we all use the same algorithms,\nit's, wait a second,\n\n83\n00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,590\nif I know the algorithm that you're using\nto encrypt something, then why can't I\n\n84\n00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,000\njust turn around and decrypt it and\nget that information back out?\n\n85\n00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,570\nAnd that's where the key comes into play.\n\n86\n00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,560\nThe key is gonna be used in\nconjunction with the algorithm.\n\n87\n00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,830\nThe key is gonna be unique to that\nparticular encryption method or\n\n88\n00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,140\nthat particular use of\nthat encryption algorithm.\n\n89\n00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,080\nOr, tied to an individual user like with\nour certificates and things like that.\n\n90\n00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,090\nI always use an example of,\n\n91\n00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,230\nyou guys remember back from the Captain\nCrunch days, the old decoder rings and\n\n92\n00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,557\nthings like that, it was just\na letter-substitution-type algorithm.\n\n93\n00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:45,810\nAnd so you would take a letter and\nyou would,\n\n94\n00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,830\nto create your secret message,\nyou would rotate up so many letters.\n\n95\n00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,530\nYou had that little ring that\nyou would turn or you had a or\n\n96\n00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,180\nwas it the old Cracker Jack's box or\nsomething like that.\n\n97\n00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,140\nSo an A becomes an M,\na B becomes an N and things like that.\n\n98\n00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,640\nLike ROT-13, rotate up 13 letters.\n\n99\n00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:10,050\nWell if we all know what we're using then\nif Don has an encrypted message then I\n\n100\n00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,040\ncould just rotate those letters back down\n13, I could get that original back out.\n\n101\n00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,540\nSo how is it we can all use\nthat same algorithm, yet\n\n102\n00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,690\nI can't decrypt your stuff and\nyou can't decrypt my stuff?\n\n103\n00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,710\nThe key is used in conjunction\nwith the algorithm.\n\n104\n00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:29,850\nMy key might be plus five, so instead of\nrotating 13, I'm actually rotating 18.\n\n105\n00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,510\nDon's key might be minus ten,\nso instead of rotating 13,\n\n106\n00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,240\nhe's actually only rotating 3.\n\n107\n00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,160\nBut only Don knows that,\ncuz he's that keeps that key safe,\n\n108\n00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,670\nkeeps it secret, and only he will know\nwhat exactly he did with that algorithm.\n\n109\n00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,480\n>> Yeah, I always think of that movie,\nA Christmas Story where he gets\n\n110\n00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,350\nthe Little Orphan Annie decoder ring,\nand he's dying to decode this message.\n\n111\n00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,850\nAt the end of the radio show, the\nannouncer rattles of these numbers, and\n\n112\n00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:57,630\nhe writes the numbers down.\n\n113\n00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,620\nThen he goes to the bathroom,\nand he's trying to decode it, and\n\n114\n00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,332\nit's drink more Ovaltine,\nright, it's an advertisement.\n\n115\n00:06:02,332 --> 00:06:05,755\nI mean, that is just a simple\ntext substitution cipher.\n\n116\n00:06:05,755 --> 00:06:09,360\nAnd it's something that elementary\nschool kids do, it's nothing big.\n\n117\n00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,850\nThe problem with those types of cyphers\nis they're pretty easy to reverse, right?\n\n118\n00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,820\nYou can figure them out.\n\n119\n00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:19,420\nAnd there are many stories historically\nabout how people have managed to do that.\n\n120\n00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,350\nLike all the broken\ncyphers from World War II\n\n121\n00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,490\nwhere some of them were very complex\ncyphers but they still got broken.\n\n122\n00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:31,523\nSo it's important that our key system is\nextremely secure and extremely strong.\n\n123\n00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:32,846\nAnd so as time goes on,\n\n124\n00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:36,903\nwe find out that some of them are not\nas strong as we thought they were.\n\n125\n00:06:36,903 --> 00:06:38,510\nLike, they have weaknesses in them.\n\n126\n00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:43,270\nOr, computers have just gotten so\nmuch better over time, that those\n\n127\n00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:48,350\nold encryption standards that were\nperfectly good are now too weak to use, so\n\n128\n00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,210\nnew ones come out.\n\n129\n00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,233\nAnd that's what we need to be aware of.\n\n130\n00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:54,320\nAnd that's why CompTIA has that\nlaundry list of encryption standards.\n\n131\n00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,940\nCuz there's a bunch of them out there and\nthey all work.\n\n132\n00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,145\nIt's just some are better than others and\nsome of them broken.\n\n133\n00:07:01,145 --> 00:07:03,985\nAnd so you don't want to use one\nof those if you can avoid it.\n\n134\n00:07:03,985 --> 00:07:06,546\n>> Back in the day, 64 bits,\nthat was a really long key.\n\n135\n00:07:06,546 --> 00:07:09,920\nAnd it took my computer a lot of\nprocessing power to manipulate that data\n\n136\n00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,167\nwith that 64-bit key.\n\n137\n00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:14,465\nNow, I mean, we can do that on our phone,\non our watch or whatever.\n\n138\n00:07:14,465 --> 00:07:19,540\nSo as our computers get more powerful,\nwe get longer and longer keys.\n\n139\n00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,510\nAnd when it comes down to it,\n\n140\n00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:24,220\nthe strength of the algorithm, and\nthe algorithm's gotta be well-designed.\n\n141\n00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,900\nAnd they've got these incredibly\ncomplex mathematical formulas that\n\n142\n00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,880\nthey're going through.\n\n143\n00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,340\nBut what it really comes down\nto is the key length, right?\n\n144\n00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,716\nThe longer the key, the stronger.\n\n145\n00:07:32,716 --> 00:07:35,293\nWhen we say longer key,\nwe're talking about bits, all right?.\n\n146\n00:07:35,293 --> 00:07:41,651\nSo we can go from 64 bits to 128 bits,\nto 512, to 2048, to 4096.\n\n147\n00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:44,650\nWe're talking about 4,096 ones and zeroes.\n\n148\n00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,950\nIt's gonna hard for somebody,\nor more difficult for somebody,\n\n149\n00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:52,221\nto guess what 4,096 ones and zeroes you\nhappen to be using with your algorithm.\n\n150\n00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,046\n>> Yep, and that's pretty common sense,\n\n151\n00:07:54,046 --> 00:07:56,203\nI mean that even Sir Mixalot taught us,\nright?\n\n152\n00:07:56,203 --> 00:07:56,935\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n153\n00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,250\n>> That's a long and strong is the.\n\n154\n00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,619\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Bad 90s rep, all right, so anyhow We do\n\n155\n00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:07,553\nhave a lot of choices when it comes to\npicking our encryption standards and\n\n156\n00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:11,290\na ton of things to go through,\nbut for this section.\n\n157\n00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,330\n>> Right.\n>> Let's keep it high level.\n\n158\n00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,620\n>> Yeah.\n>> Let's keep generic.\n\n159\n00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,180\nWe're gonna talk about concepts that\nare really applicable to most, if not,\n\n160\n00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,720\nall of the different standards.\n\n161\n00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,150\nAnd then we'll follow that up with getting\na little more nitpicky on the actual ones.\n\n162\n00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:28,270\n>> So yeah I guess one of the first\nthings we ought to talk about is just\n\n163\n00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,720\nthe difference because we have\ndifferent types of algorithms.\n\n164\n00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,205\nOr they use different sets of keys,\nI guess is one way to say it.\n\n165\n00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:37,705\nWe've got what we call symmetric\nencryption algorithms.\n\n166\n00:08:37,705 --> 00:08:40,465\nAnd then,\nwe have asymmetric encryption algorithms.\n\n167\n00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:43,805\nWith a symmetric encryption algorithm,\nwe're talking about a single key.\n\n168\n00:08:43,805 --> 00:08:46,242\nSymmetric meaning the same on both sides.\n\n169\n00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:46,872\nRight?\n\n170\n00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:49,842\nSo there's one key that's\nused with this algorithm.\n\n171\n00:08:49,842 --> 00:08:54,092\nThat key does both the encryption and\nthe decryption.\n\n172\n00:08:54,092 --> 00:08:55,862\nSo you're gonna,\nif you wanna encrypt some text,\n\n173\n00:08:55,862 --> 00:08:59,722\nyou're gonna grab the symmetric algorithm,\nyou're gonna generate a key, you plug that\n\n174\n00:08:59,722 --> 00:09:03,982\nkey into the algorithm, you encrypt\nthe text, you turn it into cypher text.\n\n175\n00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:07,732\nThen you're gonna have to send that\nencrypted information to the recipient.\n\n176\n00:09:07,732 --> 00:09:12,990\nThey need the same key,\nto be able to decrypt that information.\n\n177\n00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,190\nHence, the name symmetric.\n\n178\n00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,250\nAnd it is called symmetric key.\n\n179\n00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,170\nSometimes it's called private key.\n\n180\n00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,560\nYou might hear it referred to,\nI think, session key.\n\n181\n00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,070\nBut, again a single key.\n\n182\n00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,890\nThese are typically very lightweight,\nvery fast.\n\n183\n00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,970\nThey do a good job as far as not\ntaking up a lot of processing power\n\n184\n00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,670\nto do the encryption.\n\n185\n00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:35,550\nThe problem is, key distribution.\n\n186\n00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,660\nBecause if I wanna send a message,\nan encrypted message to somebody or\n\n187\n00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,200\nan encrypted document.\n\n188\n00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,580\nI've gotta generate that key, use it with\nthe algorithm to encrypt that document.\n\n189\n00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,450\nSend that encrypted document to\nsomebody else, the recipient.\n\n190\n00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,330\nAnd then I've gotta get them\nthe key at the other end.\n\n191\n00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,590\nAnd if somebody was in the,\nand so that key distribution,\n\n192\n00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,500\nme getting that key to the other\nend securely becomes difficult,\n\n193\n00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,580\nbecause if somebody intercepts that key,\nthey can now decrypt that information.\n\n194\n00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:08,190\nRight, as Don's showing up here,\nas we follow along with this\n\n195\n00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,230\n>> Kind of making a mess up here.\n\n196\n00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,390\n>> Right,\nwe've got your senders there on the left.\n\n197\n00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,040\nLooks like, and\n\n198\n00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,050\nhe's gonna wanna send a document\nover to the recipient on the right.\n\n199\n00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,730\nSo he's gonna generate that key, and that\nkey is gonna be used again, to encrypt, or\n\n200\n00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,060\nwith the algorithm to\nencrypt the document,\n\n201\n00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,850\nsending encrypted information over.\n\n202\n00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,250\nThen you've got to send that key over.\n\n203\n00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,850\nAnd again, that key distribution\nbecomes a real problem.\n\n204\n00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,400\n>> Yeah, so\nthe key thing to remember here.\n\n205\n00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,244\nThe key thing [CROSSTALK] is with\nsymmetric encryption there really is just\n\n206\n00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:39,746\none key.\n\n207\n00:10:39,746 --> 00:10:43,368\nIt's one key to encrypt, and\nit's that same exact key to decrypt.\n\n208\n00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:46,701\nAnd so what Mike's talking about,\nthe key distribution is,\n\n209\n00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:50,316\nwe've got to have that same key on\nboth sides so how we transmit it.\n\n210\n00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,970\nWell,you might be tempted to\nsend it over the network.\n\n211\n00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,470\nRight?\n>> Right.\n\n212\n00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,620\n>> You connect the other side,\n\n213\n00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,830\nit shows the email, or\nFTP it, or whatever.\n\n214\n00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,820\nThe problem is,\nyou really shouldn't transmit a key\n\n215\n00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,675\nacross the same communications mechanism\nthat you're going to be sending your data.\n\n216\n00:11:04,675 --> 00:11:07,310\nRight?\nBecause if a hacker is monitoring your\n\n217\n00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:11,980\ntraffic on the network, they capture the\nprivate key as it crosses the network and\n\n218\n00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,900\nthey capture your data.\n\n219\n00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,330\nNow they can decrypt it,\nthey've got everything.\n\n220\n00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,020\n>> Exactly.\nAnd\n\n221\n00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,460\nthat's something they'll mention\nin Security+, or in the exam,\n\n222\n00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,890\nis it's called Autoban, right.\n\n223\n00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,830\nSo if somebody has access to your.\n\n224\n00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,480\nLets say I emailed Don a document,\nand somebody intercepted that.\n\n225\n00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,570\nWell that means they have access,\nto that channel.\n\n226\n00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,960\nSomehow, they've gotten access, and\nthey've been able to intercept my emails.\n\n227\n00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,300\nIf I send the key in the exact same way,\nthen all of a sudden,\n\n228\n00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,390\nthey can intercept the key as well.\n\n229\n00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,040\nSo we want to use a different a method,\na different channel,\n\n230\n00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,810\na different band, whether that's.\n\n231\n00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:45,430\nI don't know.\n\n232\n00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:48,860\nPhysically, on a thumb drive or\nsomething like that.\n\n233\n00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,150\n>> Call them on the telephone and\ntell them the key.\n\n234\n00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,170\nI'm trying to think of\nways that I've done this.\n\n235\n00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,140\nDon't think a symmetric key is bad.\n\n236\n00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,590\nYou use symmetric key all the time\nbecause it's extremely efficient.\n\n237\n00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:03,390\nIt's the most efficient way to do this as\nfar as processing power and resources.\n\n238\n00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,039\nSo I know I've had to transmit some\nbefore, and I'll usually use telephone.\n\n239\n00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,131\n>> Right.\n>> I'll call them on the telephone and\n\n240\n00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:13,050\ntell them what that key is so\nthey can punch it in on the other side.\n\n241\n00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:18,330\nWith telephone though, for the stuff that\nI've been dealing with, that's been fine.\n\n242\n00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,590\nBut you're worried about\nlike government secrecy.\n\n243\n00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,820\nPhone lines can be tapped, and so\n\n244\n00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,640\ngiving a private key over the phone\nis not the greatest idea.\n\n245\n00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,157\n>> NSA already has your key,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n246\n00:12:30,157 --> 00:12:33,880\n[LAUGH].\n>> So you could burn it to a disc and\n\n247\n00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,830\nFedEx it, send it via mail or\nwhatever, although in the U.S.\n\n248\n00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,985\nour government has access to all that.\n\n249\n00:12:38,985 --> 00:12:39,640\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> So\n\n250\n00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,910\nif you really want to truly have it be\nprivate, you'll use some other encryption\n\n251\n00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,250\nservice to in turn encrypt your private\nkey and send it over that way, separately.\n\n252\n00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,200\nSo there are ways to go about that.\n\n253\n00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,950\nYou can fax it, you can manually\ncarry it over, you can set it up so.\n\n254\n00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,070\n>> Not real convenient, is it?\n\n255\n00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,850\nThat's like, hey, I want to send\nthis guy a real quick document.\n\n256\n00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,270\nI've got to encrypt it.\n\n257\n00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,100\nOh, wait.\nNow I've gotta\n\n258\n00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,630\nmail you the key to decrypt it.\n\n259\n00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,400\nYou know that's not real efficient,\nbut as Don said,\n\n260\n00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,080\nthe symetrics are still used all the time.\n\n261\n00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,190\n>> Yep.\n>> Because they are very light weight.\n\n262\n00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,940\nWe just have to make sure we figure out\na better way to deal with that key and\n\n263\n00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,960\ngetting that key to the other side.\n\n264\n00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,770\nAnd that's where our asymmetric\nalgorithms are gonna come into play.\n\n265\n00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,720\nSo asymmetric encryption algorithms.\n\n266\n00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,980\nAsymmetric meaning not\nthe same on both sides.\n\n267\n00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,690\nNow, we're gonna be talking\nabout what's called a key pair.\n\n268\n00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,100\nAnd this key pair, it's a mathematically\n\n269\n00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,440\ngenerated set of keys that\nare related to each other.\n\n270\n00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,390\nThey work in conjunction with each other.\n\n271\n00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,830\nWe're gonna call one of\nthe keys our public key and\n\n272\n00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:44,210\nwe're gonna call the other\nkey our private key.\n\n273\n00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,150\nAnd these guys again they're\nmathematically related,\n\n274\n00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,830\nthey work together.\n\n275\n00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:50,600\nOne of the cool thing about them\nthough is if you have one of them,\n\n276\n00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,400\nit's mathematically impractical.\n\n277\n00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,430\nWe won't say impossible,\n\n278\n00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:56,550\nbecause who knows what computers\ngoing to be at in the next day.\n\n279\n00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,150\nBut it's mathematically impractical for\n\n280\n00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,780\nsomebody to figure out what\nthe other half of the key pair is.\n\n281\n00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,610\nSo if Don had my public key,\nhe's not going to be able to take\n\n282\n00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:09,400\nthat public key and figure out what\nmy private key is, and vise versa.\n\n283\n00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,230\nThey're used in conjunction,\nand you can use either one.\n\n284\n00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,510\nEither one of them can do the encryption,\nwhichever one you use to encrypt,\n\n285\n00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,730\nthe other one has to be used to decrypt.\n\n286\n00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,040\nSo if I used the public\nkey to encrypt something,\n\n287\n00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,950\nthen the private key is gonna\nhave to be used to decrypt that.\n\n288\n00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:29,010\nI cannot use the public key to decrypt it,\nthe other half has to be used.\n\n289\n00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:33,280\nAnd so we can use this, well let's\ndefine public and private real quick.\n\n290\n00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,820\nSo public, they call it that because\nyou want everyone to have it,right?\n\n291\n00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:41,330\nYour public is part of your certificate\nthat gets issued to you and\n\n292\n00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,540\nyou want everyone to have that.\n\n293\n00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,090\nIt can get stored in Active Directory in a\nWindows environment, you can post it up on\n\n294\n00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:51,120\na web page, you can email it to\nthe entire world, hence the name public.\n\n295\n00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,300\nThe private key has to remain private.\n\n296\n00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,070\nIf that gets out,\nthis whole thing is for not.\n\n297\n00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,220\nSo that gets stored.\n\n298\n00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:03,480\nIn a Windows environment, it gets stored\nin a hidden location in your user profile.\n\n299\n00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,430\nWe can back that up and\nkeep it to secure media.\n\n300\n00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:11,230\nAnd so what's typically gonna happen is if\nI wanna send Don an encrypted document,\n\n301\n00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,280\nwhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nget access to Don's public key.\n\n302\n00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,140\nI'm not gonna use my keys.\n\n303\n00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,670\nI'm actually gonna get Don's public\nkey because it's freely available.\n\n304\n00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,710\nHe's sent me his certificate.\n\n305\n00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,650\nI now have his public key.\n\n306\n00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:27,140\nI can use that public key then\nto encrypt that information.\n\n307\n00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,400\nIf I use Don's public key, to encrypt it,\nthen the only key that can be used to\n\n308\n00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,090\ndecrypt it is the other half of\nthe key pair, or the private key.\n\n309\n00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,220\nAnd Don's the only one\nthat has that private key,\n\n310\n00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,000\nso now that the document's encrypted I\ndon't care if anybody intercepts it.\n\n311\n00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,620\nI mean, I could actually send\nit out via unsecured channel.\n\n312\n00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,070\nNobody's going to be able to read it.\n\n313\n00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:45,820\nDon gets it,\n\n314\n00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:50,520\nhe's the only one that has access to that\nprivate key to decrypt that information.\n\n315\n00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,646\n>> Yeah.\nAnd if that process sounds complex,\n\n316\n00:15:52,646 --> 00:15:53,870\nit really isn't.\n\n317\n00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,667\nAnd you do this every day.\n\n318\n00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:59,230\nIn fact, The fact that you're watching\nthis video right now means that you've\n\n319\n00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,833\nalready done it with us at ITProTV.\n\n320\n00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:04,884\nWhen you go to Amazon.com or eBay or some\nwebsite like that and they switch you to\n\n321\n00:16:04,884 --> 00:16:08,994\ntheir secure site, what's happening is,\nthey have a private key on their end,\n\n322\n00:16:08,994 --> 00:16:13,118\nwhich they are not gonna share with you,\nthat would be bad news for them, right?\n\n323\n00:16:13,118 --> 00:16:14,914\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But they have a public key,\n\n324\n00:16:14,914 --> 00:16:19,255\nthat was mathematically generated from\nthe private key, and that public key,\n\n325\n00:16:19,255 --> 00:16:21,530\nthey're giving it out like crazy.\n\n326\n00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:27,470\nSo when you go to that website, when\nyou go to, here I'll go to, let's see.\n\n327\n00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,880\nLet's try, we'll go to Amazon, right?\n\n328\n00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,230\nSo when we go to Amazon,\nwell actually, you know what,\n\n329\n00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,990\nI'm in ITPROTV,\nmight as well use ours, right?\n\n330\n00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,970\nSo if I go into ITPROTV and\n\n331\n00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,470\nI go to one of our secure pages, whats\na secure page, like, account settings.\n\n332\n00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,930\nIf I go into a secure page like this,\nit negotiates that out so\n\n333\n00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:48,040\nI get my SSL connection, right?\n\n334\n00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,010\nI get my little green box up there\nthat says I'm running https.\n\n335\n00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,330\n>> Right.\n>> That means I got a copy of the ITPROTV\n\n336\n00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:59,558\ncertificate and\nthat certificate is basically\n\n337\n00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:05,200\nour public key, what we're giving to you,\nto use, to encrypt your data.\n\n338\n00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,110\nYou can then encrypt data and\nsend it to us.\n\n339\n00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:11,050\nIf somebody gets that private key,\nall it enables them to do is encrypt,\n\n340\n00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,690\nnot decrypt, so it's perfectly safe,\nto distribute that out.\n\n341\n00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,850\nEach and everyone of you,\n\n342\n00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:18,880\nwhen you went through our login process,\nyou hit that, right?\n\n343\n00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,240\nAnd so you got that key, you encrypted\nyour sign-in information, and\n\n344\n00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,720\nyou sent it to us, and\nthen with our private key,\n\n345\n00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,740\nwe were able to decrypt that and\nauthenticate you as a user.\n\n346\n00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,980\nAnd that's the same thing that's\nhappening on Amazon or any other website.\n\n347\n00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,520\nAnd when you go to their website,\na lot of times you'll see it where here,\n\n348\n00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,760\nI go to Amazon's website,\nand it's not using SSL.\n\n349\n00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,480\n>> Right.\n>> Okay.\n\n350\n00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,890\nIt's not until I try and\n\n351\n00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,110\ndo something critical like\nsign in that it flips to SSL.\n\n352\n00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,420\nAnd we do the same thing on our site.\n\n353\n00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,700\nNow why,\nwhy don't we just do SSL all the time?\n\n354\n00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,250\nThere's people out there on the internet,\nright now pushing for that, saying,\n\n355\n00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,330\nhey you should do SSL all the time.\n\n356\n00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:02,570\nThere's a Firefox plug-in that does that,\nit forces SSL on all web sites and stuff.\n\n357\n00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,673\n>> I think Google now,\nI know you go to just Google's homepage,\n\n358\n00:18:04,673 --> 00:18:06,370\n[INAUDIBLE] [CROSSTALK]\n>> A lot of their web pages do.\n\n359\n00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,399\n>> It's all ready https.\n\n360\n00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,940\n>> You are starting to see that,\nbut why aren't other companies,\n\n361\n00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,610\nwhy don't we do it here at ITPROTV,\nwhy doesn't Amazon do it?\n\n362\n00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,980\nAnd the reason is performance.\n\n363\n00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,560\nWhen you have to encrypt and\ndecrypt data constantly,\n\n364\n00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,510\nwell that hurts performance on the server.\n\n365\n00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,980\nMost servers are doing it in software.\n\n366\n00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,450\nThey are doing it on their\ngeneral purpose CPU or\n\n367\n00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,830\nyou might have a SSL offload board right?\n\n368\n00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,390\n>> Right.\n>> One of those boards that handles it.\n\n369\n00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,960\nBut either way, it affects performance.\n\n370\n00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,870\nIf you have pages with non critical data,\n\n371\n00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,930\nlike our live video page,\nwhen I'm looking at right now.\n\n372\n00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,320\nThat's got our live video and\nour chat-room.\n\n373\n00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,080\nWell that's not sensitive data.\n\n374\n00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,070\nAnd so if we apply a [INAUDIBLE] cell\nto it, we're playing the price, and\n\n375\n00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,490\nI'm not saying price in terms of money.\n\n376\n00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,520\nAlthough I guess you could work that out.\n\n377\n00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,120\nBut price in terms of performance.\n\n378\n00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,460\nTo encrypt data that's not sensitive.\n\n379\n00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,492\nWe choose not to encrypt that to the video\nstream, which is a lot of bandwidth.\n\n380\n00:19:02,492 --> 00:19:03,051\n>> Absolutely.\n>> And\n\n381\n00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:06,081\nthe chat-room setup is non-encrypted and\nmost of our site is like that..\n\n382\n00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:07,950\nThat's just how Amazon is.\n\n383\n00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,290\nIf you're going to Amazon site and\nsearching for\n\n384\n00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:14,640\nthe new X-Files season on DVD,\nthat's not sensitive data.\n\n385\n00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,010\nWe're not worried about that.\n\n386\n00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:16,960\nSo they don't encrypt it.\n\n387\n00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,370\nNot until you sign in,\nnot until you start to perform operations.\n\n388\n00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,860\n>> But you start to put that\ncredit card number in there,\n\n389\n00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,440\nnow I wanna make sure\nthat data's protected.\n\n390\n00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,600\nI wanna encrypt that data.\n\n391\n00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,910\nSo there's a lot of\noverhead involved in it.\n\n392\n00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:29,160\nOne of the things we do to help a little\nbit with that performance is we'll\n\n393\n00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,040\ncombine.\n\n394\n00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,950\nWe said symmetric encryption is very fast,\nvery lightweight.\n\n395\n00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,770\n>> Cuz there's one key, right?\n\n396\n00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,570\n>> There's one key and it does not\ntake a lot of processing power.\n\n397\n00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,760\nAsymmetric encryption, now we don't have\nto worry about that key distribution issue\n\n398\n00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,660\nbut it is a lot heavier.\n\n399\n00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,630\nIt takes a lot more processing power.\n\n400\n00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,290\nSo what you'll see with like SSL\nis we actually combine the methods\n\n401\n00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:52,130\nwhat's gonna happen is I want to use\nsymmetric because I know that's fast and\n\n402\n00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,970\nthat's lightweight, but how do I get that\nsymmetric key to the other side securely?\n\n403\n00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,380\nI don't want to have to e-mail it to\nhim and anything, put it on a disk and\n\n404\n00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,960\nsend it to him or anything like that.\n\n405\n00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,130\nWhat we're gonna do is, like,\nwhen I go to Bank of America.\n\n406\n00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,220\nBank of America is gonna\nsend me their certificate.\n\n407\n00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,150\nTheir web server is gonna\nprove its identity,\n\n408\n00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,760\nsay CIM the Bank of America web server.\n\n409\n00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,700\nHere's my certificate.\n\n410\n00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,980\nIt's signed by Verisign.\n\n411\n00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,980\nYou can check to make\nsure it's still good.\n\n412\n00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,350\nOnce I verify that the certificate is\ngood, I can take that public key for\n\n413\n00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,500\nbank of America out of that certificate.\n\n414\n00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,620\nMy computer's gonna generate\nwhat we call a session key,\n\n415\n00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:28,710\nwhich is a symmetric key, and I'm gonna\nencrypt the session key or that symmetric\n\n416\n00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:33,640\nkey with Bank of America's public key\nthat I got out of their certificate.\n\n417\n00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,400\nNow I can send that symmetric key\nback across that same channel,\n\n418\n00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,860\nthat same band and I don't have\nto worry about it because I know\n\n419\n00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,770\nI used Bank of America's\npublic key to encrypt it.\n\n420\n00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,370\nThe only person that's gonna be\nable to decrypt it is Bank of\n\n421\n00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,830\nAmerica's web server.\n\n422\n00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,970\nOnce they get that copy of that key that's\nencrypted with their public key, you know,\n\n423\n00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,190\nthis sounds confusing,\n\n424\n00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,050\nthey can then use their private\nkey to decrypt the session key.\n\n425\n00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,340\nNow we both have this copy\nof this symmetric key\n\n426\n00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,020\nthat we can use to transmit data and\nsend that data back and forth.\n\n427\n00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,490\nIn the end, we get to use that nice,\nlightweight, symmetric algorithm.\n\n428\n00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,000\nThe asymmetric just allowed me\nto do that key distribution.\n\n429\n00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,248\nOkay so that's-\n>> I was gonna draw that but\n\n430\n00:21:14,248 --> 00:21:16,670\nI can't seem to click on the right key.\n\n431\n00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,360\nNo I'm screwing this up.\n\n432\n00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,500\nBut yeah.\n\n433\n00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,125\n>> So.\n\n434\n00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:24,415\nThere's two different private keys,\nthat's the confusing part, right.\n\n435\n00:21:24,415 --> 00:21:26,465\n>> Yeah.\n>> Is that you got private key one and\n\n436\n00:21:26,465 --> 00:21:27,405\nprivate key two.\n\n437\n00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:30,695\n>> That's why I never, I was never a big\nfan of calling a symmetric algorithm\n\n438\n00:21:30,695 --> 00:21:32,525\na private key cuz I think\nthat confuses people.\n\n439\n00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,170\nIt is a private key.\n\n440\n00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,450\nIt has to remain private for\nthis process to work,\n\n441\n00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:41,040\nonly the people that are authorized to\nget access to the data have that key, but\n\n442\n00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,190\nit is only one key, right?\n\n443\n00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,040\nIt's not a key pair like a public and\n\n444\n00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,490\nprivate key pair with\na symmetric encryption.\n\n445\n00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:52,480\nAnd like an SSO we typically call it\na session key because that symmetric key\n\n446\n00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,380\nis generated on a per session basis,\nif I log off,\n\n447\n00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,420\nlog back on it's going to\ngenerate a new session key.\n\n448\n00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,750\n>> I'm glad you mentioned that cuz in\nthe objectives actually called that out.\n\n449\n00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:04,610\nThey mention, so we were talking\nabout symmetric versus asymmetric but\n\n450\n00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,800\nthe call out session keys,\nwhich is what you're talking about, and\n\n451\n00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,440\nsession keys are temporary keys.\n\n452\n00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:16,120\nThis private key, now, was that diagram,\nhere Amazon they have one certificate.\n\n453\n00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,850\nOr ITPROTV.\n\n454\n00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:17,960\nWe have one certificate.\n\n455\n00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,220\n>> Right.\n>> So everybody's getting that same\n\n456\n00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,350\npublic key.\n\n457\n00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,500\nBut once your session is built up that way\nand you exchange the second private key,\n\n458\n00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,270\nthe one you're gonna be using for\nthe symmetric encryption,\n\n459\n00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,070\nthat's unique for every session.\n\n460\n00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,890\nSo every viewer, everybody that's logged\nin right now watching this video,\n\n461\n00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,860\neach of you had a separate session key,\nall right?\n\n462\n00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,500\nAnd every customer at Amazon.\n\n463\n00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,690\nIt's not like we're all using that\nsame public key to encrypt everything,\n\n464\n00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,390\njust that initial setup.\n\n465\n00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:46,780\nAnd so that's called a session key, and\nany time we have temporary keys like that,\n\n466\n00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,460\nthe other term you'll see mentioned is\nthis guy way down here, Ephemeral key.\n\n467\n00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,582\n>> Ephemerals, yep.\n\n468\n00:22:50,582 --> 00:22:54,930\n>> All right, Ephemeral keys are ones\nthat are used on a per execution or\n\n469\n00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:59,270\nper session basis, and\nare generally never reused.\n\n470\n00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:02,690\nThey could use that one time, and\nthey get thrown out, and then that's it.\n\n471\n00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,880\nThat makes things very secure, cuz you're\nusing different keys all the time.\n\n472\n00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,910\nIf someone were to break through\nthe encryption, it would just be for\n\n473\n00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,500\nthat particular session.\n\n474\n00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,330\nYour next session is all new.\n\n475\n00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,190\n>> Yeah, so\nthat makes it a lot more efficient,\n\n476\n00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,850\nbecause we're using that lightweight\nalgorithm to do the bulk\n\n477\n00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,700\nof the encryption,\nthe bulk of the work there.\n\n478\n00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,180\nAll right so that takes care of.\n\n479\n00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,890\nAnd then we talk about in band and\nout of band.\n\n480\n00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:31,140\nRight we said that if I am in band,\nmeaning using the same channel,\n\n481\n00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,070\nwhere whatever I am using to send\nthe document or the encrypted information,\n\n482\n00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,260\nI am also using to\ntransmit the keys as well.\n\n483\n00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,044\nLike with https, I mean that\nwould be considered in band, but\n\n484\n00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,125\nwe're protecting it.\n\n485\n00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:45,306\nWe're okay with that because we're\nencrypting that session key or\n\n486\n00:23:45,306 --> 00:23:47,500\nthat second private key\nwith that public key.\n\n487\n00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,910\nOut of band being like Don was saying\nearlier Call them on the telephone and\n\n488\n00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:54,790\ngive them the key or put it on a disk and\nFedEx to them or something like that.\n\n489\n00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,960\n>> All right, so let's talk about\nthe difference between block and\n\n490\n00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,380\nstream ciphers.\n\n491\n00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,110\nMike, you gave an example earlier\nof a text substitution cipher,\n\n492\n00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:05,680\nwhere we say the letter A is a number or\nwhatever or\n\n493\n00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,340\nyou do the-\n>> Rotate routine or something.\n\n494\n00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,120\n>> Yeah.\n>> Exactly.\n\n495\n00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,440\n>> So\nthose are just simple substitutions and\n\n496\n00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,980\nthose are perfect examples\nof a stream cipher.\n\n497\n00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,530\n>> Right.\n>> Where we're encrypting each character\n\n498\n00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:20,520\nas it passes through the system and\nthis is considered the old way of\n\n499\n00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,500\ndoing things because there's\na certain weakness to stream ciphers.\n\n500\n00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:28,530\nIf you're an English speaker,\nin the English language, the letter E and\n\n501\n00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,385\nthe letter T are the most common letters.\n\n502\n00:24:31,385 --> 00:24:33,150\n>> Mm-hm.\nR-S-T-L-N-E, right?\n\n503\n00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,380\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Like they give them on Wheel of\n\n504\n00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,320\nFortune, yeah.\n\n505\n00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,570\n>> [LAUGH] So you've got some letters\nthat are more common than others and\n\n506\n00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,680\nthere's only ten numbers, right?\n\n507\n00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,835\n>> Right.\n>> Zero through nine.\n\n508\n00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:43,700\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so\n\n509\n00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,850\nif you've got 26 letters and\nten numbers, there's really only so\n\n510\n00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:51,040\nmany combinations that we can have when we\ndo a type substitution cipher like this.\n\n511\n00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,750\n>> Right.\n\n512\n00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:56,460\n>> So, when somebody wants to break it,\nthey take your cipher text and\n\n513\n00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,330\nthey just say, all right,\nwhat's the most common value?\n\n514\n00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,290\nAll right, that's either gonna be E or T.\n\n515\n00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,370\nAnd then from there,\nthey start wiggling things around.\n\n516\n00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,414\nThen they go, all right,\n\n517\n00:25:03,414 --> 00:25:06,290\nthe word the is the most common\nword in the English language.\n\n518\n00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,300\nIt's got T and E with an H in the middle.\n\n519\n00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,680\nSo the T and\nE should be the two most common.\n\n520\n00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,050\nAnd then if we can find them\nwith a single gap between them,\n\n521\n00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,270\nwe stick in an H now we got the word THE.\n\n522\n00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,330\nAnd they start just breaking your code.\n\n523\n00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,560\nThat's the problem with a stream cipher.\n\n524\n00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,690\nStreams ciphers encode each character\nindividually as they come through.\n\n525\n00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,330\nSo it streams.\n>> Really down to the bit level, yeah,\n\n526\n00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,160\nall the way down to each individual bit.\n\n527\n00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,620\nOne advantage of streams that I\nlike we said it is very quick.\n\n528\n00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,370\nTypically most of your symmetrics\nare stream, I want to say that.\n\n529\n00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,870\nAnd then another advantage\nis that if you get an error,\n\n530\n00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,100\nbecause it's doing one bid at a time.\n\n531\n00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,080\nAn error in the algorithm is only gonna\ngenerate an error for that one bit.\n\n532\n00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,275\n>> Yeah.\n>> It could be advantageous.\n\n533\n00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:50,540\n>> So that is considered\nthe old way of doing it.\n\n534\n00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,130\nThe less secure way.\n\n535\n00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:53,797\nThe new way,\n\n536\n00:25:53,797 --> 00:25:58,560\nthe way that we see almost exclusively\nnow is what's called a block cipher.\n\n537\n00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,170\nAnd a block cipher,\nit won't do an individual bit or\n\n538\n00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,830\neven an individual character.\n\n539\n00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,280\n>> It's usually, we normally say 128 bit?\n\n540\n00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,770\n>> 64 bit, well it used to be,\nmost of them are 64 bit chunks of data.\n\n541\n00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,650\nBut they can vary in size\ndepending on the algorithm\n\n542\n00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,180\n>> I know some of\n\n543\n00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:15,160\nthe really new ones that aren't generally\naccepted yet have moved up to 256.\n\n544\n00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,940\nSo, as you have more memory and\nmore processor power,\n\n545\n00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,310\nyou can do these larger chunks of data.\n\n546\n00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:24,950\nAnd what it'll do is it'll collect\na chunk of data and then encode that.\n\n547\n00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,660\nAnd the cool part about doing it that way,\nis if I say, the dog has fleas and\n\n548\n00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,465\nthat's in one chunk.\n\n549\n00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:31,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n550\n00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,405\nthen the cat has fleas in another chunk.\n\n551\n00:26:33,405 --> 00:26:35,269\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Well those two chunks are almost\n\n552\n00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:35,840\nidentical.\n\n553\n00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,360\nThe dog has fleas, the cat has fleas.\n\n554\n00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:37,920\nRight?\n>> Right.\n\n555\n00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,950\n>> Just cat and dog.\n\n556\n00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,710\nThose are the only things\nthat have changed.\n\n557\n00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:45,930\nBut a block cipher will encrypt the entire\nstring, and so the values that we get,\n\n558\n00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,700\nthe cipher text, will be entirely\ndifferent for those two strings.\n\n559\n00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,395\nIt's not like I'll be able to see\nthat some of the words are common,\n\n560\n00:26:53,395 --> 00:26:57,755\nit will be entirely different because\nit encoded those as an entire value.\n\n561\n00:26:57,755 --> 00:27:00,505\n>> Exactly, so it would make it much more\ndifficult for somebody to try to see\n\n562\n00:27:00,505 --> 00:27:04,095\na pattern in there and\ntry to break that encryption algorithm.\n\n563\n00:27:04,095 --> 00:27:07,703\n>> Now, back in the 70s when a lot of this\nstuff was being researched and developed,\n\n564\n00:27:07,703 --> 00:27:11,705\nwe just didn't have the computing power\nto be able to do a block ciphers.\n\n565\n00:27:11,705 --> 00:27:12,355\nRight?\n\n566\n00:27:12,355 --> 00:27:15,280\nAnd so stream ciphers is what\nwe kind of started with.\n\n567\n00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,607\nAnd then as things progressed\nby the 80s and the 90s,\n\n568\n00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:23,550\nstream ciphers were on the way out, and\nblock ciphers are now the new standard.\n\n569\n00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:29,470\nSo when we look at all that laundry list\nof letters later on, all the acronyms.\n\n570\n00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,620\nWe'll see that almost all of\nthem are block ciphers today.\n\n571\n00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,960\n>> Absolutely.\n\n572\n00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,090\n>> All right, so\nthat's kind of stream versus block.\n\n573\n00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,800\nNow, we've got some other\nstuff to talk about, Mike, but\n\n574\n00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,790\nthis might be a good spot to stop and\ntake a break.\n\n575\n00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,550\nWhat do you think?\n\n576\n00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,210\n>> Yeah, I think so.\n\n577\n00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,120\n>> All right.\n>> I like it.\n\n578\n00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,180\n>> So we do need to dive into\na bunch of other little categories,\n\n579\n00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,590\nconcepts built around encryption\nstandards, obviously.\n\n580\n00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,720\nWe've got a lot of that today.\n\n581\n00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,820\nBut we'll take a break.\n\n582\n00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,868\nWhen we get back,\nmore encryption after this.\n\n583\n00:27:54,868 --> 00:28:02,645\n[MUSIC]\n\n584\n00:28:02,645 --> 00:28:04,560\nAll right.\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n585\n00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,720\nOkay so we've got a kind of a grab bag\nof topics left on this objective to get\n\n586\n00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,730\nthrough the main part where the types\n\n587\n00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,690\nof encryption standards\nthat are out there, right?\n\n588\n00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,890\nSo we took a look at symmetric and\nasymmetric and how then function.\n\n589\n00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:17,490\n>> Yeah.\n\n590\n00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,670\n>> A few other things that we've got.\n\n591\n00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,030\nMost of what we were talking about,\n\n592\n00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,080\nwe were giving examples\nof transport encryption.\n\n593\n00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,660\nSo you're sending your credit card data\nfrom your computer to Amazon.com's\n\n594\n00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,030\ncomputer, and you wanna make sure\nwhile it's in transit, it's encrypted.\n\n595\n00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,230\nAnd that's exactly what like SSL provides.\n\n596\n00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,760\n>> It's important, it's something that\nwe really have to be aware of cuz\n\n597\n00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,420\nsome things like, EFS, is a good example.\n\n598\n00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:44,340\nEFS is my encrypting file system\nin a Windows environment and\n\n599\n00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,540\nit's part of the NTFS file system.\n\n600\n00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:51,230\nSo I can encrypt a file on my local\nmachine and it's nice and it's secure and\n\n601\n00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,180\nthen I can copy that file up to a file\nserver that has a partition that's\n\n602\n00:28:55,180 --> 00:29:00,400\nformatted NTFS and when it arrives and it\ngets up on that partition it's encrypted.\n\n603\n00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,290\nBut it was not encrypted during\nthe transmission process because ESF\n\n604\n00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:07,910\nis a technology that encrypts\ndata at rest, not data in motion.\n\n605\n00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,980\nSo, it's important that we understand\nwhen is this encryption kicking in,\n\n606\n00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,140\nwhen is it protecting my data,\n\n607\n00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:17,090\nis it only when it's in transit, is it\nonce it gets to its destination or both?\n\n608\n00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:20,942\n>> Yeah, and remember from previous\nepisodes that we've got in rest,\n\n609\n00:29:20,942 --> 00:29:22,850\ndata in motion, data in use.\n\n610\n00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:26,530\nAnd when we talk about a technology like\nSSL, which is encrypting your network\n\n611\n00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:31,535\ncommunication or IPsec or VPN tunnels for\nthat matter, they are data in motion.\n\n612\n00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:34,925\nThey don't do anything for\ndata at rest or data in use.\n\n613\n00:29:34,925 --> 00:29:35,585\n>> Right.\n>> And in fact,\n\n614\n00:29:35,585 --> 00:29:38,805\nthat's how that Heart Bleed attack\nworked was data in use, right?\n\n615\n00:29:38,805 --> 00:29:42,390\nIt was attacking the servers to be\nable to lift private keys off them.\n\n616\n00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,830\nIt wasn't attacking\nthe transit stuff at all.\n\n617\n00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,590\nSo we have to kind of\nthink of that big picture.\n\n618\n00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:51,720\nSSL is just one piece of\na total security package.\n\n619\n00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,900\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n620\n00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,730\n>> All right.\nSo that's transport encryption.\n\n621\n00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,610\nNow another thing that we\ncan use these keys for,\n\n622\n00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:00,806\nlike our public keys,\nis for non-repudiation.\n\n623\n00:30:00,806 --> 00:30:02,180\n>> Non-repudiation.\n\n624\n00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:02,830\nFunny term.\n\n625\n00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:07,439\n>> When we send data across a network it's\npossible that somebody could intercept it\n\n626\n00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,320\nand change it.\n\n627\n00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,910\n>> Right.\n>> Or even modify it.\n\n628\n00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,790\nSo Mike goes to do a bank transfer.\n\n629\n00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:15,740\nHe does an online check from\none account to another, and\n\n630\n00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,040\nI intercept it and I change\nthe destination account to be mine.\n\n631\n00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,052\nAnd now it comes over to me, and\nI get it and now I'm rich, right?\n\n632\n00:30:22,052 --> 00:30:24,030\n[LAUGH]\n>> Not with my transfers,\n\n633\n00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,415\nyou're not gonna get rich, but.\n\n634\n00:30:25,415 --> 00:30:26,470\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n635\n00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:30,940\nhow do we ensure that doesn't happen,\nand that's what non-repudiation does.\n\n636\n00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:36,880\nIt says basically, it gives us a mechanism\nwhere we can digitally sign traffic.\n\n637\n00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,030\nWe basically look at the data\nthat we're gonna send,\n\n638\n00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,060\nand we run it through a formula.\n\n639\n00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,190\nAnd we create typically what's\ncalled a hash value, and\n\n640\n00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,810\nthat hash value is calculated\nbased on our data.\n\n641\n00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,950\nAnd we send it along to the other end.\n\n642\n00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,050\nThe other end gets the data and\n\n643\n00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:57,730\nthey run the same algorithm against\nthe data to create their own hash value.\n\n644\n00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,910\nThey compare their hash value to ours, and\n\n645\n00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:04,350\nif they match,\nthat means the data wasn't modified.\n\n646\n00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:07,730\nBut if somebody modified the data,\nwhen they run the algorithm,\n\n647\n00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,830\nthey'll get a different result than we do.\n\n648\n00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,210\nThe hashes won't match.\n\n649\n00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:15,640\nAnd so when they don't match,\nwe know that there was a problem,\n\n650\n00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,260\nthat there was a failure.\n\n651\n00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,120\n>> Exactly.\nYeah, it's pretty cool\n\n652\n00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,210\nwith the digital signatures cuz\nnon repudiation as Don was saying,\n\n653\n00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,450\nI can verify the integrity of that data.\n\n654\n00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,120\nAnd that's probably something\nwe should mention too.\n\n655\n00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,510\nWe haven't used those terms and\nCompTIA likes those.\n\n656\n00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,860\nWith our different encryptions,\n\n657\n00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,700\nwe're worried about does\nit provide confidentiality,\n\n658\n00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,690\nmaking sure only the authorized\npeople can see that information.\n\n659\n00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:41,042\nDoes it provide integrity,\nmaking sure the data hasn't been modified?\n\n660\n00:31:41,042 --> 00:31:46,079\nAnd then non-repudiation is really kinda\nmaking sure it hasn't been modified,\n\n661\n00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:49,583\nand also tying the creator or\nthe originator of the data.\n\n662\n00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,875\nTying that identity to the data.\n\n663\n00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:53,667\nLike, when we talk about emails.\n\n664\n00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:58,209\nWith nonrepudiation, I can't deny\nthe fact that I sent that email.\n\n665\n00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:01,610\nWe'll get into digital\nsignatures here in a second.\n\n666\n00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,410\nIt's not a good deal.\n\n667\n00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:07,240\nIt's one of my favorite little\ntools to use show, yeah, exactly.\n\n668\n00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,800\nIf I put a digital signature on that\nemail, well because of the way it uses my\n\n669\n00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:15,960\nprivate key to encrypt that signature,\nthat hash value I can't deny I sent it.\n\n670\n00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,830\nRight?\nThere's no way I can say no, I didn't send\n\n671\n00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,850\nthat unless somebody has access to\nmy private key which they shouldn't.\n\n672\n00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,750\n>> Yeah, so\nyou see these used quite a bit.\n\n673\n00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,038\nObviously, proving that you\nare who you say you are.\n\n674\n00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:28,726\nWhen you go to ITProTV or\nwhen you go to Amazon.com and\n\n675\n00:32:28,726 --> 00:32:32,972\nyou see that certificate, instead of just\nproviding you an encryption mechanism,\n\n676\n00:32:32,972 --> 00:32:36,167\nit's letting you know that this\nis the actual Amazon website.\n\n677\n00:32:36,167 --> 00:32:36,909\n>> Right.\n\n678\n00:32:36,909 --> 00:32:40,635\n>> Or this is the actual ITProTV website\nand not just some website that some guy\n\n679\n00:32:40,635 --> 00:32:42,894\nwhipped up one day as\npart of a phishing scam.\n\n680\n00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:47,485\nRight, because the trusted certificate\nproviders on the internet are not gonna\n\n681\n00:32:47,485 --> 00:32:52,142\nsell a certificate to ITProTV to someone\nwho doesn't actually own the domain, or\n\n682\n00:32:52,142 --> 00:32:55,334\nsell one on Amazon.com, or\nat least they shouldn't.\n\n683\n00:32:55,334 --> 00:32:56,635\n>> [LAUGH] Hopefully they don't.\n\n684\n00:32:56,635 --> 00:32:57,381\n>> And when it happens,\n\n685\n00:32:57,381 --> 00:32:59,748\nthat certificate provider normally\ngoes out of business, right?\n\n686\n00:32:59,748 --> 00:33:00,733\n>> Yes.\n\n687\n00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:02,172\nWhat is it Diginotes?\n\n688\n00:33:02,172 --> 00:33:05,981\n>> Diginotes are one of the big ones yeah\ncuz they issued some certificates for\n\n689\n00:33:05,981 --> 00:33:09,682\nlike Google I think is who it was and\nso yeah they're out of business now.\n\n690\n00:33:09,682 --> 00:33:14,638\nBut we can use it even for\nsimple things like let's say that I\n\n691\n00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:19,397\nwant to install Linux on my computer,\nso I go out there and\n\n692\n00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:24,790\nI want to download Centos but\nthe problem is the Centos project.\n\n693\n00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,110\nIt's open source.\n\n694\n00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,790\nThey don't get a ton of funding, and so\n\n695\n00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,750\nit can be slow to download\nthe images from them.\n\n696\n00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:35,810\nSo I might want to go and download\nCentos from a mirror, so like here,\n\n697\n00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:38,350\nI'm going to a university\nthat's here in Florida.\n\n698\n00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:43,740\nAnd I'm gonna reach out and try and\ndownload that ISO right here from them.\n\n699\n00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,520\nOkay.\nSo, here it is.\n\n700\n00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,127\nI can go and I can download it.\n\n701\n00:33:46,127 --> 00:33:47,480\nWell, l the problem is,\n\n702\n00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:53,860\nif I download CentOS from someone\nother than the CentOS organization.\n\n703\n00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,140\nHow do I know it hasn't\nbeen tampered with?\n\n704\n00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:58,480\n>> Right, what if I slipped some malware\nin there, some kind of backdoor program or\n\n705\n00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,040\nsomething like that?\n\n706\n00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,030\n>> Yeah.\nThis is the University of South Florida.\n\n707\n00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,990\nThey've got tons of students and\nyou know their IT department is staffed\n\n708\n00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,915\nequally by professional employees and\nstudents.\n\n709\n00:34:05,915 --> 00:34:07,435\nThings that are going through the program.\n\n710\n00:34:07,435 --> 00:34:10,255\nAnd some of those students might be\nmalicious, so they could have taken this\n\n711\n00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:14,735\nISO and modified it and put trojans\nin there and put tracking software or\n\n712\n00:34:14,735 --> 00:34:18,135\nbackdoors, unauthorized user accounts,\nthey could have put that in there.\n\n713\n00:34:18,135 --> 00:34:18,705\nI wouldn't know.\n\n714\n00:34:19,805 --> 00:34:25,625\nWell notice right beneath it,\nhere's some checksums, right?\n\n715\n00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:26,875\nMD5, SHA-1, SHA-256.\n\n716\n00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:31,740\nI can use these checksums\nto verify whether or\n\n717\n00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,340\nnot the ISO has been tampered with.\n\n718\n00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,885\nNow I don't want to get\nthe checksums from here.\n\n719\n00:34:35,885 --> 00:34:36,990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I get\n\n720\n00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:40,030\nthe checksums from the same place,\ncuz the attacker, they'll modify the ISO,\n\n721\n00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,830\nthey'll calculate a new checksum,\nthey'll stick it there.\n\n722\n00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,510\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n723\n00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,780\n>> But what I can do is I can go into\nanother mirror, or I can go into\n\n724\n00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:51,010\nthe actual CentOS website to get it\nbecause these are really small files.\n\n725\n00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:54,640\nSo I can get the checksum\nfrom CentOS organization and\n\n726\n00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:58,250\ndownload the ISO from here,\nand then I can compare them.\n\n727\n00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,729\nI can calculate my own checksum and\nsee if they match.\n\n728\n00:35:00,729 --> 00:35:03,580\nAnd if they do match, I know it\nhasn't been tampered with, right?\n\n729\n00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,370\n>> Exactly.\n\n730\n00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,960\nYeah and when we look at these\nhashing algorithms they're\n\n731\n00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,070\nwhat's called a one way encryption.\n\n732\n00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:11,870\nNow when we say a one way encryption\nthey're not really encrypting the data\n\n733\n00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:15,530\nperse, like the original data\nis still there unprotected.\n\n734\n00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:20,560\nBut it runs that data through this\nalgorithm, generates a fixed rate output.\n\n735\n00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,180\nIt doesn't matter what the input is.\n\n736\n00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,490\nIt's always going to generate\nthe same length output.\n\n737\n00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,040\nAnd every time you run that document or\nthat ISO or\n\n738\n00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,060\nwhatever, it's always gonna\ngenerate the exact same output.\n\n739\n00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,510\nIf I change on little thing in that ISO or\nthat word document or\n\n740\n00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:40,130\nwhatever It's going to generate\na completely different hash value, or\n\n741\n00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:46,540\nwhat we call, the output of these hashing\nor other rims, is called a message digest.\n\n742\n00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:50,520\nAnd it'll change if something\nin the original file is changed.\n\n743\n00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,680\nAnd we see it all over the place.\n\n744\n00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,244\nLike Don was saying,\ndownloading a Linux distro,\n\n745\n00:35:54,244 --> 00:35:56,160\nverifying that you got the right one.\n\n746\n00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,257\nWindows uses it to check\nthe integrity of its system's files.\n\n747\n00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:03,555\nAll right, all your system's files, it\nkeeps a table of message digest is run all\n\n748\n00:36:03,555 --> 00:36:07,620\nyour system files through this hashing\nalgorithm and it saves those values.\n\n749\n00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,440\nAnd every time we start it up it runs\nthose documents through that algorithm\n\n750\n00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,290\nagain and verifies the current hash\nvalue with the one it had before.\n\n751\n00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:19,330\nIf those match then it knows\nthe document hasn't changed.\n\n752\n00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:22,530\nIf those don't match, that means\nsomething's changed in that system file.\n\n753\n00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,510\nAnd it's gonna throw up that error,\nor it's gonna cease to boot.\n\n754\n00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,980\nOr it's going to give you a warning or\nsomething like that.\n\n755\n00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,940\n>> Let me just show you\na real quick example.\n\n756\n00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,396\nI took the notes that I had\nwritten down earlier and\n\n757\n00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,924\njust kind of threw them\nhere into Karen's hasher.\n\n758\n00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:35,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And what I'll do is I'll go to,\n\n759\n00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,596\nI'll just do MD5.\n\n760\n00:36:36,596 --> 00:36:38,640\nYou'll see there's several\ndifferent hash types we could use.\n\n761\n00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,882\n>> Right.\n>> So I'll use MD5 and\n\n762\n00:36:39,882 --> 00:36:41,240\nI'll compute the hash.\n\n763\n00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,474\nSo it just ran this text through the\nalgorithm, and this is what it generated,\n\n764\n00:36:45,474 --> 00:36:46,702\nthis hash right here.\n\n765\n00:36:46,702 --> 00:36:47,630\nSo I'm just going to add that.\n\n766\n00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:51,031\nSo this is my original hash.\n\n767\n00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:52,901\nRight?\n\n768\n00:36:52,901 --> 00:36:55,211\nWhich will be that guy.\n\n769\n00:36:55,211 --> 00:36:56,070\nOkay?\n\n770\n00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:58,428\nAnd then I'm just going to\nmake a little modification.\n\n771\n00:36:58,428 --> 00:37:01,550\nSo maybe I'll go to the very end of it and\nI'll just add the letter E.\n\n772\n00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,665\nAll right?\n\n773\n00:37:02,665 --> 00:37:04,104\nSo I just added the letter E.\n\n774\n00:37:04,104 --> 00:37:06,182\nAnd I'll compute that hash again.\n\n775\n00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:10,930\nNotice the entire hash has changed,\nnot just a little.\n\n776\n00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,819\nI added one letter, and that's it.\n\n777\n00:37:13,819 --> 00:37:16,590\nI didn't even add a or\na space or anything.\n\n778\n00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:21,380\nI just added one letter and the entire\nhash, there's a common number right there.\n\n779\n00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,549\nSo, there's a 6 here and a 6 here, but for\n\n780\n00:37:23,549 --> 00:37:26,850\nthe most part there are no Common\nletters and numbers throughout.\n\n781\n00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,810\nIn fact that is the only line.\n\n782\n00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,570\n>> That is the only line.\n\n783\n00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:33,110\n>> So the whole hash is changed\njust because that one letter.\n\n784\n00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:38,830\nNow the cool part is, if I fix it,\nif I take that E away and\n\n785\n00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:44,400\nI compute the hash It should\nreturn the original hash,\n\n786\n00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,280\nbecause it doesn't matter that\nthe data's been modified.\n\n787\n00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,862\nAs long as it was put back\nto be identical, right, so\n\n788\n00:37:49,862 --> 00:37:51,172\nwe can do error recovery.\n\n789\n00:37:51,172 --> 00:37:55,504\nAnd I can see here, Notepad++ picking\nit up, but those two are identical and\n\n790\n00:37:55,504 --> 00:37:57,205\nhow I formatted there.\n\n791\n00:37:57,205 --> 00:37:59,567\nSo I know that it's put\nback the way it was.\n\n792\n00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:02,708\nThis is used in TCP,\nwhen we send those packets back and forth,\n\n793\n00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:05,792\nwe've got that CRC in the end\nof the trailer on those packets,\n\n794\n00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:09,590\nit's exactly what it's doing,\nit's running that packet through a hash,\n\n795\n00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:13,360\nputting that value in the trailer of\nthat packet, it gets to the other end.\n\n796\n00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,620\nThe other end is setting that aside,\nrunning it through that algorithm again,\n\n797\n00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,630\ncomparing the value that it generated\nwith the one that you sent.\n\n798\n00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,870\nIf they match, fantastic.\n\n799\n00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,620\nIf they don't, drop the packet,\nsend it again.\n\n800\n00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:29,326\n>> So, remember on the exam\nthat all security that we do,\n\n801\n00:38:29,326 --> 00:38:34,806\nit has to provide one of the three\nfacets of the CIA triad, right?\n\n802\n00:38:34,806 --> 00:38:38,721\nWe have this idea, well,\nyou guys have seen in other episodes,\n\n803\n00:38:38,721 --> 00:38:43,800\nwhere we've got confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability, right?\n\n804\n00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,040\nConfidentiality means we don't let people\nsee our data unless we want them to.\n\n805\n00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,320\nIntegrity means we insure our\ndata hasn't been tampered with.\n\n806\n00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,400\nAnd then availability.\n\n807\n00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,790\nWe make sure that we're able to\nuse our systems when we want to.\n\n808\n00:38:55,790 --> 00:39:01,260\nSo encryption, symmetric and asymmetric\nencryption, they provide confidentiality.\n\n809\n00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,470\nNo one can see your data\nunless you give them the key.\n\n810\n00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:08,950\nHashes like these, digital signatures,\nthey provide integrity.\n\n811\n00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:12,760\nIf somebody modifies your data,\nyou'll know it because the hash will fail.\n\n812\n00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,455\n>> Exactly.\n\n813\n00:39:13,455 --> 00:39:19,260\nAnd as we said it's used everywhere,\nwe use it when NTCP with our system files.\n\n814\n00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,470\nI'm trying to think of what else.\n\n815\n00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,490\nWhen you digitally sign an email.\n\n816\n00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,044\nYou're really doing\na couple of things there.\n\n817\n00:39:24,044 --> 00:39:27,181\nWhen you sign an email,\nwhen you add a digital signature,\n\n818\n00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:31,610\nyou're running that text through this\nhashing algorithm generating an output.\n\n819\n00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:34,837\nAnd then you're signing that\nwith your private key or\n\n820\n00:39:34,837 --> 00:39:39,292\nyou're encrypting that hash value,\nthat output with your private key.\n\n821\n00:39:39,292 --> 00:39:43,698\nThe other end, if they can use your\npublic key to decrypt that hash value,\n\n822\n00:39:43,698 --> 00:39:45,547\nthere's my nonrefudiation,\n\n823\n00:39:45,547 --> 00:39:50,380\nthere's how I know it was sent by Who\never's public key I'm using to decrypt it,\n\n824\n00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:54,816\nand in that hash value you can verify\nthat the document has been modified.\n\n825\n00:39:54,816 --> 00:39:58,708\n>> We do use these a ton, especially for\nlike password storage, right?\n\n826\n00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:01,106\nYou don't wanna have a database file\nthat has all your users' passwords\n\n827\n00:40:01,106 --> 00:40:01,625\nin it, right?\n\n828\n00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:04,180\nSomebody could get that file and\nnow they've got all your passwords.\n\n829\n00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,840\nSo most systems like Windows or\neven like the ITProTV site,\n\n830\n00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,150\nthe way we store passwords.\n\n831\n00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:13,360\nWhat we do is we hash the password\nthat you guys put in.\n\n832\n00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,950\nAnd it's stored in\na database in a hashed form.\n\n833\n00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,470\nCool thing about a hash,\nthey're non-reversible, right?\n\n834\n00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,660\n>> Yeah.\nIt's a one way encryption.\n\n835\n00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,760\n>> If you get this hash.\n\n836\n00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,860\nWhat good is it?\n\n837\n00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,720\nNothing.\n\n838\n00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,940\nYou can't just undo it because\nit's only one piece of the puzzle.\n\n839\n00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,040\nYou've got the algorithm, but\n\n840\n00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,325\nyou don't have the seed, the data that\nwas fed into it to generate this value.\n\n841\n00:40:34,325 --> 00:40:37,320\n>> Right.\n>> So it's not particularly useful.\n\n842\n00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,080\nSo what happens is when you log in,\nyou're typing in a password.\n\n843\n00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,900\nAnd we hash that and compare it to\nthe hash that's stored in our database.\n\n844\n00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,600\nIf the hashes match, then you must have\ntyped the right thing and we let you in.\n\n845\n00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,280\nIf the hashes don't match,\nyou must have typed the wrong thing.\n\n846\n00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,650\nWe don't actually know what that password\nis, and that's how Windows works.\n\n847\n00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:57,200\nIn the Windows active directory,\nyour passwords are stored hashed.\n\n848\n00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,080\nIt's how Macro S works,\nalmost every Linux distro.\n\n849\n00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,640\nIf you go and look in the shadow files\nall the passwords are hashed in there and\n\n850\n00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,530\nthey are a big jumbled mess of text and\nnumbers.\n\n851\n00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,310\nYou can't decipher what the password is.\n\n852\n00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:11,030\n>> Exactly,\nthat way if I steal that database,\n\n853\n00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:14,290\nI'm not going to have your password,\nall I have is a hash value password.\n\n854\n00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:17,090\n>> And the other neat thing about\nhashes is their fixed length.\n\n855\n00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:19,960\nSo, when we do these hashes,\nno matter how much or\n\n856\n00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,540\nhow little text we have,\nthey're always the same length.\n\n857\n00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:26,340\nIf I go back to Karen's Hasher, where\ndid I park that thing, here, all right.\n\n858\n00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:26,940\nI'm just gonna.\n\n859\n00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,830\nWoops.\n\n860\n00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:32,420\nI'm gonna wipe all this stuff out and\nI'm just gonna type in one letter and\n\n861\n00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,310\nthat's it.\n\n862\n00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,410\nSo just one letter and\nI'll compute an MD5 hash.\n\n863\n00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,940\nAnd see how that one letter A,\n\n864\n00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:43,080\nonce it was fed through the algorithm it's\nthe exact same link as everything else.\n\n865\n00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,900\nSo that's another reason why\nwe can't reverse this because\n\n866\n00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,100\nyou don't even know how many\ncharacters are involved to try.\n\n867\n00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,025\nYou just can't do it.\n\n868\n00:41:50,025 --> 00:41:51,540\n>> Yap.\n\n869\n00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,520\nYeah it does lead to.\n\n870\n00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,570\nI think we're going to get to,\n\n871\n00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:56,660\nI think we've already talked\nabout in another episode but\n\n872\n00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,570\nthe downside of that is it\ndoes lead to some collisions.\n\n873\n00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:02,470\nBecause you have a fixed link output\n\n874\n00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:05,810\nthere could be more than one thing\nthat generates the exact same output.\n\n875\n00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:07,740\nAnd that can lead to some collision.\n\n876\n00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,930\nI don't need to know what your\npassword is to log in as you.\n\n877\n00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:15,880\nI need to know what hash value is\ngenerated when you type in your password.\n\n878\n00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,190\nCuz if I can find anything else that\ngenerates the exact same hash value,\n\n879\n00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,690\nI could just use that.\n\n880\n00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:23,160\n>> Yeah.\nAnd that used to not be a problem, but\n\n881\n00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,560\nas computers have advanced and\nbecome faster, it has become a reality.\n\n882\n00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,450\nSo collision attacks are now a reality.\n\n883\n00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:31,110\nSo, standard's like MD-5,\nwhat I just used.\n\n884\n00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,720\nWell, that's kinda the older one,\n\n885\n00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,420\nand collisions are possible and\nit's not that hard to do it.\n\n886\n00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,670\nSo, they've been encouraging us to switch.\n\n887\n00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:43,420\nThat's why you'll see, like down here,\nI've got all the way up to SHA-512.\n\n888\n00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,660\nIf we compute something like SHA-512,\nsee what it's doing?\n\n889\n00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:49,920\nThat's text and\nthat's gonna, so that's 512.\n\n890\n00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,560\n>> That is a considerably\nlonger key that's in use there,\n\n891\n00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,092\nlet me move that off my screen.\n\n892\n00:42:56,092 --> 00:43:00,722\n>> [CROSSTALK] Such a longer key\nyou've got less chance of collision.\n\n893\n00:43:00,722 --> 00:43:01,765\nCollisions are still possible.\n\n894\n00:43:01,765 --> 00:43:03,445\nCollisions will always be possible.\n\n895\n00:43:03,445 --> 00:43:03,950\n>> Right.\n\n896\n00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:07,410\n>> But computing technology will\nhave to advance significantly\n\n897\n00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:09,120\nbefore that can happen.\n\n898\n00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,740\nSpeaking of significant advancements,\nthat's another exam objective.\n\n899\n00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:15,340\nWhere is it in here?\n\n900\n00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,422\nHere, Elliptic curve in\nquantum cryptography.\n\n901\n00:43:18,422 --> 00:43:19,176\n>> Alright.\n\n902\n00:43:19,176 --> 00:43:19,930\n>> Alright.\n\n903\n00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,970\nThere is some weird stuff-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n904\n00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,400\n>> Coming out in the future.\n\n905\n00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,180\nAnd it all comes down to, our computers\nkeep advancing year after year after year.\n\n906\n00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:31,960\nWell, we're kind of in a doldrum right\nnow, where for the last five years,\n\n907\n00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,670\nwe haven't seen any significant process or\narchitecture improvements.\n\n908\n00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:38,160\nWe're starting to see\npeople adding more cores.\n\n909\n00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,950\nBut that's not actually\nmaking a processor better,\n\n910\n00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,938\nit's just making there be more processors.\n\n911\n00:43:42,938 --> 00:43:43,498\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n912\n00:43:43,498 --> 00:43:44,540\n>> Yap.\n>> So I could make my\n\n913\n00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,900\ncar go faster by sticking\ntwo engines in it,\n\n914\n00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:51,280\nbut if we can make one engine\ngo faster that would be better.\n\n915\n00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,510\nSo what's going to happen the next big\nbreakthrough are going to be things that\n\n916\n00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:01,330\nare, today, we look at them, and we say\nthat's kind of like sci-fi, pseudoscience.\n\n917\n00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:02,660\n>> Right.\n>> But, down the road,\n\n918\n00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,630\nthis maybe the future of computing, so.\n\n919\n00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:06,500\n>> It's a quantum leap ahead.\n\n920\n00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:11,240\n>> Yeah, so like quantum cryptography,\nit's kind of based around the idea of,\n\n921\n00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,540\nsomething interesting is, we do a binary,\nand you have zeros and ones.\n\n922\n00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,810\nRight?\nSo, every bit\n\n923\n00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:18,560\nis going to represent a zero or a one.\n\n924\n00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,600\nA bit can only be one of two things.\n\n925\n00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,510\nRight?\n\n926\n00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:26,480\nBut in quantum computing,\na bit can be a zero or a one or\n\n927\n00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,910\nit can be both at the same time,\na zero and a one.\n\n928\n00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:33,940\nSo a bit, what they call\na QBit in quantum computing,\n\n929\n00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:38,410\ncould actually be doing two\nthings at the same time.\n\n930\n00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:42,150\nSo if you have one bit you can\nnow do twice as much with it.\n\n931\n00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:46,560\nIf you have two bits,\nyou can now do four times as much.\n\n932\n00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,200\nBecause it's.\n\n933\n00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,250\n>> Exponential.\n\n934\n00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:49,370\n>> Exponential, there we go.\n\n935\n00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:50,620\nThat's the word I'm looking for.\n\n936\n00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,720\nAnd so when you start to get to eight bit,\n\n937\n00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,580\n128 bit, whatever, you can do\nmillions of things at the same time.\n\n938\n00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:59,660\nWhereas before you could do you\nknow a much smaller number.\n\n939\n00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:02,310\nSo quantum computing\nreally blows the tops off.\n\n940\n00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:06,330\nAnd will make us able to do things\nthat are just insanely complex\n\n941\n00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:08,700\nin an amazingly short amount of time.\n\n942\n00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,540\nThe problem is the technology\nis not perfect yet.\n\n943\n00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,360\nSo we don't have it, right?\n\n944\n00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,210\nWe need to be aware that this\nstuff is coming down the line, but\n\n945\n00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:15,860\nwe don't have it yet.\n\n946\n00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:19,870\nAnd when it does,\nwe're going to have a super big problem,\n\n947\n00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:24,590\nbecause all of our old technologies,\nlike MD5, and stuff like that.\n\n948\n00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:27,950\nWhile their fine now,\nif you have quantum processors.\n\n949\n00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:29,240\n>> Right.\n>> You'll be able to break those in\n\n950\n00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,120\na matter of minutes.\n\n951\n00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:30,700\n>> Absolutely.\n\n952\n00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,990\n>> Where as right now, it might take\na thousand years to break,right?\n\n953\n00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:36,830\nSo it's really gonna change things,\nand we're gonna have to completely\n\n954\n00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:40,820\nget all new algorithms that are secure\nenough to survive in a quantum world.\n\n955\n00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:41,450\n>> Absolutely.\nAnd\n\n956\n00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:45,040\nwe don't have to dive into the actual\nquantum mechanics that goes behind here.\n\n957\n00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,650\nOne of the cool things I really like\nabout what I've read up on the quantum\n\n958\n00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:51,990\ncryptography is the way you read the data.\n\n959\n00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,360\nThey use this and\nI'm not sure exactly how this works again,\n\n960\n00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,860\nthey've got that polarization filter\nthat they will use to view the bits,\n\n961\n00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:58,990\nto see what state they're in.\n\n962\n00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,280\nAs Don was saying, zero, one or both.\n\n963\n00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,780\nWhat's cool is, if somebody uses the wrong\npolarization filter to read the bits,\n\n964\n00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,990\nit changes the bits and\nit actually corrupts the data.\n\n965\n00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:13,430\nSo I'll immediately know at\nthe other end that somebody has been\n\n966\n00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:16,160\neavesdropping on my data\nbecause they tried to read it.\n\n967\n00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,240\nDidn't read it correctly.\n\n968\n00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,830\nAnd they corrupted all the data.\n\n969\n00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:21,190\nSo you can immediately tell\nyou're being eavesdropped or\n\n970\n00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:23,370\nthat somebody might have\naccessed that information.\n\n971\n00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:27,370\n>> Yeah, and this is all,\nwe're talking about the photo level and\n\n972\n00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,870\nphotons don't observe\nthe normal law of physics.\n\n973\n00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,232\nSo it's really cool if you're into sci-fi.\n\n974\n00:46:32,232 --> 00:46:37,130\nIt's neat stuff, but yeah,\nthe reality is, it's coming.\n\n975\n00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,410\n>> It's down the road.\n\n976\n00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:39,930\n>> Yeah, they still haven't.\n\n977\n00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,010\nThere hasn't been a quantum\ncomputer built yet\n\n978\n00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:45,805\nthat's been officially certified\nas truly doing quantum computing.\n\n979\n00:46:45,805 --> 00:46:46,610\n>> Alright.\n>> There\n\n980\n00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:49,250\nhave been some that have been\nlabeled quantum computers.\n\n981\n00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,190\nAnd there's been some debate over whether\nor not they're actually doing it.\n\n982\n00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:54,190\nSo.\n>> Everybody wants to be the first.\n\n983\n00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:55,550\n>> Yeah.\nSo we shall see.\n\n984\n00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:56,549\nBut that's coming down the line.\n\n985\n00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:00,350\nAll right, a few other things,\nlet's talk about Key escrow.\n\n986\n00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:03,880\nAll right, we talked about our private\nkeys and how important they are.\n\n987\n00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,860\n>> Right.\nGotta keep those safe.\n\n988\n00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:08,795\n>> If somebody get those,\nyou've given up the keys to the kingdom.\n\n989\n00:47:08,795 --> 00:47:10,487\n>> Yep.\n>> Literally they can decrypt all of\n\n990\n00:47:10,487 --> 00:47:11,150\nyour data.\n\n991\n00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:11,820\n>> Absolutely.\n\n992\n00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,270\n>> Well here's the problem,\nyou've got a private key,\n\n993\n00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:17,910\nyou need to keep safe, you don't\nwant to share it with anybody,right?\n\n994\n00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:20,085\nBut what happens if you lose your key?\n\n995\n00:47:20,085 --> 00:47:21,590\n>> Right.\n>> Well then you're in even bigger\n\n996\n00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,520\ntrouble because there's no,\nyou can't decrypt your data right?\n\n997\n00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,340\n>> Now I can't even get to my own stuff.\n\n998\n00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:27,565\n>> So you gotta back it up.\n\n999\n00:47:27,565 --> 00:47:28,680\n>> Yeah.\n>> Well, what do you do?\n\n1000\n00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,660\nDo you write it on a post it note,\nstick it on your monitor?\n\n1001\n00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,760\nRight?\nThat's.\n\n1002\n00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,930\n>> You back it up, and you store it on the\nsame drive the key's stored on anyways?\n\n1003\n00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:35,760\nI mean.\n\n1004\n00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,298\n>> [LAUGH] You put it on a CD,\nand leave it there on your desk.\n\n1005\n00:47:38,298 --> 00:47:41,870\nWhen you back up that key,\nyou're opening yourself up to risk.\n\n1006\n00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:45,040\nSo what I've done traditionally in\norganizations is we burn them to a disk\n\n1007\n00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:45,910\nand we lock them in a vault.\n\n1008\n00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:47,320\nSo we've got them locked and secured.\n\n1009\n00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,770\nThere's the back-up of my key.\n\n1010\n00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:51,583\nSomeone would have to get into the vault\nto be able to get to that data.\n\n1011\n00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:52,958\nWe're safe,right?\n\n1012\n00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:55,958\nBut if you don't have that available\nto you, what else can you use?\n\n1013\n00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:57,667\nThe other problem is,\nall right, it's in a safe.\n\n1014\n00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:58,792\nRight?\n>> What if the building burns down?\n\n1015\n00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,720\n>> Yeah.\n>> What if something happens where we\n\n1016\n00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,875\ncan't get to that safe.\n\n1017\n00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:06,130\nSo, there are key escrow\nservices that are out there.\n\n1018\n00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:09,288\nAnd what you can do,\nis you can store your key with them.\n\n1019\n00:48:09,288 --> 00:48:12,950\nThe only problem is, who are you\ngonna trust with your private key?\n\n1020\n00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:15,195\nThe answer to that\nshould always be no one.\n\n1021\n00:48:15,195 --> 00:48:16,420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You shouldn't trust anyone with your\n\n1022\n00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,412\nprivate key.\n\n1023\n00:48:17,412 --> 00:48:19,730\nAll right.\nIf you're gonna use a key escrow service,\n\n1024\n00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,610\nyou never use just one.\n\n1025\n00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:23,530\nYou always more than one.\n\n1026\n00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:26,050\nTypically you use three or more.\n\n1027\n00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:29,580\nWhat you do, is you take your key,\nand you break it into pieces.\n\n1028\n00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:30,290\n>> Chop it up.\n\n1029\n00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:34,360\n>> Yep.\nAnd you store a piece with each provider.\n\n1030\n00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,020\nAll right?\n\n1031\n00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:39,140\nAnd that way no one key escrow service,\nhas your whole key,\n\n1032\n00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,660\nthey just have a portion of it.\n\n1033\n00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:43,900\nAnd if you have a failure, you can reach\nout to each of those providers and\n\n1034\n00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,300\nget the portions of your key,\nand reassemble it and\n\n1035\n00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,560\nnow you've got your key back from them,\nall right?\n\n1036\n00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,690\nSo, key escrow services are out\nthere don't trust them, right?\n\n1037\n00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:53,490\nAnd you're not gonna hurt\ntheir feelings by saying this.\n\n1038\n00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:55,609\n[CROSSTALK] They understand\nthat's part of the business.\n\n1039\n00:48:55,609 --> 00:48:57,710\nBut yeah,\nyou just store a piece of that key.\n\n1040\n00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:00,210\nAnd you probably wanna store\nthe same piece more than one place,\n\n1041\n00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:03,010\nin case one of those escrow services\ngoes out of business or whatever.\n\n1042\n00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,225\nBecause if they go out of business\nto use that part of the key-\n\n1043\n00:49:05,225 --> 00:49:05,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1044\n00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,460\n>> Your key's not good unless you have\n\n1045\n00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:12,640\nthe whole thing, so\nyou might wanna break that up.\n\n1046\n00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,650\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1047\n00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,470\nAll right, so let's keep, what else?\n\n1048\n00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:16,030\nSteganography.\n\n1049\n00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:17,250\n>> Steganography's a fun one.\n\n1050\n00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:17,790\n>> It is.\n\n1051\n00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:23,480\n>> It's a type of encryption, but\nit's encryption in plain sight.\n\n1052\n00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:27,130\nSometimes the easiest way to hide\nsomething is to stick it right out there,\n\n1053\n00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,000\nand that's what the principle\nof Steganography is all about.\n\n1054\n00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,800\nThis was actually used in\nthe September 11th attacks.\n\n1055\n00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:38,070\nIt was a way to communicate\nthat was very difficult to see.\n\n1056\n00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,630\nYeah, because it's different\nfrom our normal encryption.\n\n1057\n00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:45,850\nEncryption we are not trying to hide\nthe fact that we have data, right?\n\n1058\n00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:48,300\nYou see the encrypted file,\nit's sitting right there.\n\n1059\n00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,370\nI just can't access it, because I\ndon't have the key to decrypt it.\n\n1060\n00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:53,740\nSo, we're not hiding\nthe fact that we have data.\n\n1061\n00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,220\nWe're just obscuring what the data is.\n\n1062\n00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:00,392\nStenography says, I'm gonna hide\nthe fact that there's even data.\n\n1063\n00:50:00,392 --> 00:50:05,530\nWe're gonna take some kind of file,\nor a lot of times it's a picture,\n\n1064\n00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:07,538\nor an MP3 file, or something like that.\n\n1065\n00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:10,540\nAnd we're gonna take our data that\nwe wanna hide, and we're gonna\n\n1066\n00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:16,240\nslip it inside that file, by altering\nthe least significant bids typically.\n\n1067\n00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:22,110\nWith photos for example,\nif you've got 24 bit\n\n1068\n00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:27,004\ncolor I could take a couple of those bits\nand I could, they're loving your shirt.\n\n1069\n00:50:27,004 --> 00:50:30,950\n[LAUGH] I could borrow\na couple of those bits,\n\n1070\n00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:33,550\nand use that to store my data in there.\n\n1071\n00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:37,410\nWithout affecting the color is any way\nthat anybody's gonna really notice.\n\n1072\n00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:39,770\n>> Yeah, let me show you guys an example.\n\n1073\n00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,050\nI'm gonna fire up a utility here.\n\n1074\n00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:45,216\nIt's an old utility, but it's been around\na long time, and it still works just fine.\n\n1075\n00:50:45,216 --> 00:50:49,630\nIt's called S tools, and what I've done\nis I've taken the IT Pro TV logo and\n\n1076\n00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:50,500\nI've thrown it in here.\n\n1077\n00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,240\n>> Right?\n>> So it's just a bit map file.\n\n1078\n00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,520\nHere it is, my logo.\n\n1079\n00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,460\nIf anybody opened this file,\nthey would see it, and they'd see my logo.\n\n1080\n00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,960\n>> Yeah.\n>> Nothing too special there.\n\n1081\n00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,860\n>> Then I'm gonna take, let's see.\n\n1082\n00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,830\nWhat am I gonna take?\n\n1083\n00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:05,090\nLet me just make a little\ntext file here really quick,\n\n1084\n00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:09,050\nand I'm gonna store some\nsuper-secret documents in here.\n\n1085\n00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:12,620\nSo I'm gonna call this\nmy secrets.txt file, and\n\n1086\n00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:17,580\nhere are all my deepest, darkest, secrets.\n\n1087\n00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:18,742\n>> I am your father.\n\n1088\n00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,990\n>> All right, there we go,\nthis will be an awesome file.\n\n1089\n00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:23,150\nSo here's my file with my data.\n\n1090\n00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:26,300\nAnd what I can do with S tools,\nis I can take that secrets file, and\n\n1091\n00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,960\nI can just drag it and\ndrop it right there on the picture.\n\n1092\n00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:35,990\nAnd when I do that, it's going to encrypt\nmy data, and store it in the picture data.\n\n1093\n00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:37,335\nAll right?\nIt's gonna piggy-back\n\n1094\n00:51:37,335 --> 00:51:38,760\nwith the picture data.\n\n1095\n00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,030\nI need a set a password, so\nI'll pick a password for it.\n\n1096\n00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:45,290\nAnd the password is gonna be the seed for\nthe encryption, that it's gonna do.\n\n1097\n00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:48,360\nAnd then, I need to pick an algorithm\nto use, I'll use Triple DES.\n\n1098\n00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,050\nAll right.\n\n1099\n00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:54,850\nSo now, it's going to encrypt it and\nthere it is.\n\n1100\n00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:58,250\nOn the left, there's the unaltered logo.\n\n1101\n00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:03,450\nOn the right, there's the logo with\nthat text file stored inside of it.\n\n1102\n00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:04,250\nCan you see the difference?\n\n1103\n00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:06,970\n>> I don't know about you, but\nI can not see the difference at all.\n\n1104\n00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:09,570\n>> To the human eye, it's imperceivable.\n\n1105\n00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:12,540\nThey look the same, all right?\n\n1106\n00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:15,890\nAnd if you're a network administrator,\nand you're capturing and\n\n1107\n00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:19,870\nscanning data on your ultra secure\nnetwork, you just see an image, right?\n\n1108\n00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:20,750\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Do you\n\n1109\n00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:22,870\neven know there's encrypted data in there?\n\n1110\n00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:25,130\n>> No.\n>> No, it's completely hidden.\n\n1111\n00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:27,340\nThat's the glory of this, right?\n\n1112\n00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:32,990\nAnd then what you can do is you take\nthis image, and you send it to somebody.\n\n1113\n00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:35,870\nYou send it to whoever it is that you\nwant to have access to it, or you post\n\n1114\n00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:39,168\nit on your website and the other person\nyou tell them in person or whatever,\n\n1115\n00:52:39,168 --> 00:52:43,550\nwhen you wanna get data from me go here,\nand every image has encrypted data in it.\n\n1116\n00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:46,400\nSo just open it up, here's the pass\nphrase you need to use, and\n\n1117\n00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,120\nyou can get that data out.\n\n1118\n00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,640\nSo, all they have to do is go and\n\n1119\n00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,624\nfind that image hosted on your website or\nwherever.\n\n1120\n00:52:52,624 --> 00:52:53,880\nAnd they can open it up, and\n\n1121\n00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,840\nthey can choose to reveal,\nand they'll just punch in.\n\n1122\n00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,670\nThey've got to have that pass phrase,\nright?\n\n1123\n00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:04,220\nYou got to have the private\nkey to decrypt the data.\n\n1124\n00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:07,070\nAnd so they can punch in\nthat information and hit OK.\n\n1125\n00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:11,900\nAnd there it is, it found secrets.txt\nis in there, and I can save that,\n\n1126\n00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,310\nI'll just save it to,\nwell My Documents is fine.\n\n1127\n00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:16,840\nAnd then, we can open that up.\n\n1128\n00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,604\nAnd I'll just go in to My Documents.\n\n1129\n00:53:25,567 --> 00:53:28,610\nAnd I should have my\nsecrets.txt right there.\n\n1130\n00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:29,270\nAnd here it is.\n\n1131\n00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:32,530\nThere's all my deepest, darkest secrets,\ntransmitted right into image.\n\n1132\n00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:37,320\nAnd what happened in the September 11th\nattacks, is some communications were being\n\n1133\n00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,250\npassed this way, and they were doing\nit through pornographic images.\n\n1134\n00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,065\nAnd what happened was the US\nIntelligence Agencies made a mistake.\n\n1135\n00:53:43,065 --> 00:53:43,895\nThey said,\n\n1136\n00:53:43,895 --> 00:53:49,790\nobviously an ultra-Islamic organization\nisn't gonna use pornographic images.\n\n1137\n00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:52,310\n>> Right.\n>> And so, these things were being sent,\n\n1138\n00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:54,390\nand they didn't even know\ndata was inside of them.\n\n1139\n00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:56,480\nThat's how messages\nwere being transmitted.\n\n1140\n00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,540\nThat and they were using the drafts\nfolder of an inbox, things like that.\n\n1141\n00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,857\n[CROSSTALK] There's all\nsorts of techniques.\n\n1142\n00:54:01,857 --> 00:54:03,400\nThere's browsers you can get.\n\n1143\n00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,000\nOne of the ones I always\nthought was cool was CameraShy.\n\n1144\n00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,100\nIt's just a browser.\n\n1145\n00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:11,820\nAnd just like Internet Explorer or Chrome,\nyou can use it to surf the Internet.\n\n1146\n00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,670\nBut if you go to certain webpages and\n\n1147\n00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:16,570\nthey have starganographic\ninformation in their images.\n\n1148\n00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:19,430\nYou know the password,\nyou can type that password in, and\n\n1149\n00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:20,870\nall of a sudden you see all those images.\n\n1150\n00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:23,300\nTo anybody else the webpage\nlooks completely normal,\n\n1151\n00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,120\nit could be a completely\nlegitimate webpage.\n\n1152\n00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,610\nWe'll just hidden information.\n\n1153\n00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:32,780\n>> Sweet, so let's see Mike I know\nwe've got more to talk about, but\n\n1154\n00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:35,450\nthat's actually probably a good\nspot to stop for a break.\n\n1155\n00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:37,340\nWe did the digital signature pictures.\n\n1156\n00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:41,620\nActually the only thing we haven't talked\nabout here is, perfect forward secrecy.\n\n1157\n00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,390\n>> Lets hit that real quick.\n\n1158\n00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:44,160\n>> Lets hit that before.\n\n1159\n00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,720\nSo, we talked about symmetric and\nasymmetric encryption.\n\n1160\n00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,220\nWe talked about,\nhow symmetric is more efficient?\n\n1161\n00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:54,629\nBut the problem that we have is that,\n\n1162\n00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:59,800\nwe can't really transmit that private\nkey securely to the other side.\n\n1163\n00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,900\nAnd so we normally use them\nin combination, right?\n\n1164\n00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:06,850\nWe have the Public Key, Private Key\ntransmission for the asymmetric.\n\n1165\n00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:10,690\nWe build our session up, and\nthen we need to exchange our keys.\n\n1166\n00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:13,860\nAnd we exchange our Private Keys,\nour new, our second Private Key, and\n\n1167\n00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,760\nthat's when we're start to be\nable to do symmetric encryption.\n\n1168\n00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,620\nRight.\n\n1169\n00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:22,960\nWell, perfect forward secrecy, is an added\nlevel of security that we can use.\n\n1170\n00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,650\nWhen you build up this session here,\n\n1171\n00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:28,680\nthe asymmetric session,\nyou now need to transmit these keys.\n\n1172\n00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,410\nAnd when you transmit the keys,\nyou need to do it securely, and so\n\n1173\n00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:35,670\nwe're gonna use algorithms like\nthe Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm,\n\n1174\n00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:38,650\nis one for\nhanding off the key to the other side.\n\n1175\n00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:43,120\nWell, that exchange is not\ndone securely by default\n\n1176\n00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,480\nbecause you've all ready got\nan encrypted session here, right?\n\n1177\n00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,253\n>> Right.\n>> Why bother encrypting this hand off,\n\n1178\n00:55:48,253 --> 00:55:50,293\nbecause the tunnel is all ready encrypted?\n\n1179\n00:55:50,293 --> 00:55:51,875\nYou're already protected, right?\n\n1180\n00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:52,750\nThat's enough, isn't it?\n\n1181\n00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:53,250\nYeah.\n\n1182\n00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,989\n>> Well,\nif you're transmitting your private key,\n\n1183\n00:55:55,989 --> 00:55:58,120\nyou may want to be doubly sure.\n\n1184\n00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:58,680\n>> Right.\n\n1185\n00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:02,220\n>> And to be doubly sure, you can use PFS.\n\n1186\n00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:07,035\nPFS is perfect for secrecy and what it\ndoes is it actually uses a completely\n\n1187\n00:56:07,035 --> 00:56:12,297\nseparate set of session keys,\njust for that private key exchange.\n\n1188\n00:56:12,297 --> 00:56:16,635\nSo it's doing a second set of encryption\nto exchange the private keys.\n\n1189\n00:56:16,635 --> 00:56:19,872\nAnd once those are done,\nthen we flip over to Symmetric.\n\n1190\n00:56:19,872 --> 00:56:21,662\nNow many people view this as,\n\n1191\n00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,408\nthe word I always see is one I have\na hard time pronouncing, superfluous.\n\n1192\n00:56:25,408 --> 00:56:26,021\n>> Yeah.\n\n1193\n00:56:26,021 --> 00:56:27,139\n>> There we go, I guessed that right.\n\n1194\n00:56:27,139 --> 00:56:28,882\n>> I like that.\n>> People view it as unnecessary,\n\n1195\n00:56:28,882 --> 00:56:31,495\nsecurity theater, like an extra\nlayer of security that's not needed.\n\n1196\n00:56:31,495 --> 00:56:32,679\n>> Yep\n>> But if you're dealing\n\n1197\n00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:34,747\nwith critical data,\nbetter safe than sorry.\n\n1198\n00:56:34,747 --> 00:56:35,322\n>> Yeah.\n>> And so\n\n1199\n00:56:35,322 --> 00:56:41,080\nwhen you set up a VPN on a Cisco router or\non a Juniper firewall, or whatever, you'll\n\n1200\n00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:45,340\nsee that option when you build a tunnel,\nwhether you want to enable PFS or not.\n\n1201\n00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:49,160\nAnd a lot of systems have it turned off\nby default, and you'll hear people say,\n\n1202\n00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,000\nwell it hurts performance,\nI don't want to do it.\n\n1203\n00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,400\nWell, they're right, but\n\n1204\n00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,460\nit only hurts performance during the\ntunnel initialization when it comes up.\n\n1205\n00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:56,920\n>> Just that first part of it, right?\n\n1206\n00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,899\n>> Yeah, in my opinion there's\nno reason not to do it.\n\n1207\n00:56:58,899 --> 00:56:59,880\n>> Right.\n>> If your device\n\n1208\n00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,210\nis supported you might as well do it,\nit gives you an added layer of security.\n\n1209\n00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:06,970\nIf someone were able to break the public,\nprivate key pair for\n\n1210\n00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:10,940\nthe initial session buildup, they still\nwouldn't be able to intercept this\n\n1211\n00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:16,030\nprivate session key because it's being\nencrypted with a separate set of keys.\n\n1212\n00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:18,980\nAnd when that's done,\nthen this communication is being encrypted\n\n1213\n00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,750\nwith a set of keys they\nweren't able to intercept.\n\n1214\n00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:21,900\n>> Exactly.\n>> So, it's\n\n1215\n00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,100\nan added level of security, PFS.\n\n1216\n00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,330\n>> And\nwe always talk about layers of security,\n\n1217\n00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:28,460\nso we just want one more layer that's\ngonna make it that much more difficult for\n\n1218\n00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:30,532\nthose bad guys to get access.\n\n1219\n00:57:30,532 --> 00:57:31,470\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1220\n00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:34,080\n>> All right, well, Mike,\nthat is a good spot for us to stop.\n\n1221\n00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,650\nThe next section we've got is\nour laundry list of acronyms.\n\n1222\n00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:40,510\nSo we're going to hit that and\nI made a little spreadsheet that will help\n\n1223\n00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:42,380\nwith that so\nwe will get a chance to see it.\n\n1224\n00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:43,930\nBut for right now,\nlet's stop and take a break.\n\n1225\n00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:45,958\n>> All right.\n>> And we'll pick back up in a few.\n\n1226\n00:57:45,958 --> 00:57:49,620\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1227\n00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:53,298\n[SOUND]\n>> All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1228\n00:57:53,298 --> 00:57:56,530\nOkay so it is time.\n\n1229\n00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:58,200\n>> Time to buy a cool shirt like that.\n\n1230\n00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,940\n>> Well, it is time for you to buy a cool\nshirt, it's Hawaiian shirt Friday.\n\n1231\n00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:04,270\nIt's time to kick out the stops and\ngo acronym soup.\n\n1232\n00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:04,930\n>> All right.\n\n1233\n00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:08,950\n>> So, in the security world,\nthere is a ton of selection out there for\n\n1234\n00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:11,540\nwhat algorithms you can use to\ndo all sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n1235\n00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:15,460\nAnd so, the next objective\n6.2 is given a scenario,\n\n1236\n00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:18,835\nuse appropriate cryptographic methods,\nright?\n\n1237\n00:58:18,835 --> 00:58:19,500\n>> Right.\n\n1238\n00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,460\n>> Just because there's a lot of them,\ndoesn't mean you pick one and\n\n1239\n00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,640\nthat's all you use.\n\n1240\n00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:27,350\nSome of them are hashing algorithms that\nwe use for non-repudiation and integrity.\n\n1241\n00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:31,430\nOthers are encryption algorithms\nthat we use for confidentiality.\n\n1242\n00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:33,840\nAnd so, you've gotta choose\nthe right ones for the job.\n\n1243\n00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,443\n>> I've got a big spinning wheel and\nI've got each one labeled on there.\n\n1244\n00:58:36,443 --> 00:58:38,090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I just give it a whirl and\n\n1245\n00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:40,221\nI'm like,\nall right that's the one I'm gonna use.\n\n1246\n00:58:40,221 --> 00:58:41,849\n>> [LAUGH] Go with the one\nwith the coolest name.\n\n1247\n00:58:41,849 --> 00:58:43,206\nThe longer the name the better, right?\n\n1248\n00:58:43,206 --> 00:58:44,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So there's a lot of choices.\n\n1249\n00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,620\nAnd you even see this outside of security,\nlike if you're a network engineer and\n\n1250\n00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:49,770\nyou're setting up a VPN tunnel.\n\n1251\n00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:52,560\nAnd you're like I'm just going to\nuse the wizard, I'll click through.\n\n1252\n00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,600\nWell, the wizards are gonna ask you what\nyou wanna use or, sometimes the wizards\n\n1253\n00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,380\nwill pick a weaker security level\nthan what you actually want.\n\n1254\n00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:03,040\n>> Yeah, the default in the wizard\nis probably not what you want.\n\n1255\n00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,760\n>> We see that in Cisco-land.\n\n1256\n00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:09,540\nCisco routers and firewalls will pick\nlower level security by default or\n\n1257\n00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:12,480\nalgorithms by default,\nbecause they're more compatible, right?\n\n1258\n00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,430\n>> System compatibility and performance\nwise, it's going to make that device look\n\n1259\n00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:18,372\nlike it's flying, but\nprobably not what you want.\n\n1260\n00:59:18,372 --> 00:59:21,660\n>> Yeah and I've seen that,\nlike right here with WPA and\n\n1261\n00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:23,520\nWPA2 for wireless networks.\n\n1262\n00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,600\nYou'll see some equipment will default to\nWPA because it's a little less processor\n\n1263\n00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,520\nintensive, it's a little more\ncompatible across older systems.\n\n1264\n00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,260\nBut if everything you have sports WPA 2,\nyou should be using it, right?\n\n1265\n00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:36,850\nWe go up to that higher level encryption.\n\n1266\n00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:39,780\n>> Yeah and one of the things for this\nexam, don't beat yourself up trying to\n\n1267\n00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,815\nlearn each algorithm and exactly\nhow it works, and things like that.\n\n1268\n00:59:42,815 --> 00:59:44,990\nThere's really just a few\nbasic things we need to know.\n\n1269\n00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:45,740\nWe need to know what they are.\n\n1270\n00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:49,050\nYou need to be able to tell the difference\nbetween a hashing algorithm and\n\n1271\n00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:49,990\nan encryption algorithm.\n\n1272\n00:59:49,990 --> 00:59:53,710\nWell, I say hashing like its not\nan encryption, it is a one-way encryption.\n\n1273\n00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:54,760\nThe difference between your hashing,\n\n1274\n00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,580\nbecause they might ask you something\nsomething like, hey you wanna use a,\n\n1275\n00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:59,610\nyou're gonna digitally sign an email.\n\n1276\n00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:01,380\nWhat would you use?\n\n1277\n01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:03,473\nMD5, Diffie-Hellman, Triple DES or T-KIP.\n\n1278\n01:00:03,473 --> 01:00:06,091\nWell MD5's the only hashing\nalgorithm in the list, so\n\n1279\n01:00:06,091 --> 01:00:08,220\nthat's the one you're gonna pick, right?\n\n1280\n01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:12,210\n>> Yeah, so when I was studying for\nthis exam years ago.\n\n1281\n01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:14,794\nWhat year did I get security certified?\n\n1282\n01:00:14,794 --> 01:00:15,390\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1283\n01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:18,229\n>> Like 2004, 2005?\n>> In the 2000's?\n\n1284\n01:00:18,229 --> 01:00:19,198\n>> It was a long time ago.\n\n1285\n01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:23,495\nAnyhow when I got\ncertified I said all right,\n\n1286\n01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:27,010\nI use a handful of these algorithms.\n\n1287\n01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:30,950\nThe ones I use I know but there were\nones on there that I didn't know.\n\n1288\n01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:31,450\n>> Right.\n>> And so\n\n1289\n01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:35,060\nfor those,I said,\nI just got to memorize it, right.\n\n1290\n01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,860\nAnd I hate memorizing things but\nit happens.\n\n1291\n01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:39,000\nSo what I did is I made a spreadsheet.\n\n1292\n01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,700\n>> Right.\n>> And I made it as,\n\n1293\n01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:44,080\nover the years I've changed it but I went\nahead and put it in as a Google doc.\n\n1294\n01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,770\nAnd I've shared it out for\nour viewers to use.\n\n1295\n01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:48,130\n>> Fantastic.\n>> So you guys don't have to try and\n\n1296\n01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:51,010\njot this down real quick, but\nI'll post it with the show notes.\n\n1297\n01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:52,700\n>> Yes.\n>> When this is posted on the website,\n\n1298\n01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:56,495\nyou'll have the link to the spreadsheet,\nbut let me show it to you guys.\n\n1299\n01:00:56,495 --> 01:01:00,275\nIt's right here so,\nthis is what I made and\n\n1300\n01:01:00,275 --> 01:01:05,375\nbasically it just lists all\nthe algorithms that you might see\n\n1301\n01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:09,122\non the exam and I've categorized\nthem based on a few things.\n\n1302\n01:01:09,122 --> 01:01:10,572\nAll right.\n\n1303\n01:01:10,572 --> 01:01:13,732\nBasically the main thing you\nneed to know for the exam,\n\n1304\n01:01:13,732 --> 01:01:17,422\nif you have nothing else,\nyou need to know which algorithms\n\n1305\n01:01:17,422 --> 01:01:21,597\nare hashing algorithms versus\nwhich ones are encryption.\n\n1306\n01:01:21,597 --> 01:01:22,262\n>> Alright.\n\n1307\n01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:27,074\n>> And if it's encryption, you need to\nknow if it's asymmetric or symmetric.\n\n1308\n01:01:27,074 --> 01:01:29,212\nAnd so that's why I divided this up.\n\n1309\n01:01:29,212 --> 01:01:33,170\nI put the asymmetric guys up top and\nthe symmetric guy is next, so\n\n1310\n01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:35,920\nthese are all of our encryption.\n\n1311\n01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,800\nAnd then after that I put all\nthe hashing ones on here,\n\n1312\n01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,978\nso I just divided them to\nmake it easy to remember.\n\n1313\n01:01:41,978 --> 01:01:42,738\n>> Right.\n\n1314\n01:01:42,738 --> 01:01:43,348\n>> Okay.\n\n1315\n01:01:43,348 --> 01:01:46,960\nThere actually might be a few on here\nthat you might not see on the exam,\n\n1316\n01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,310\nlike Tiger and Napsac.\n\n1317\n01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:53,700\nThose are a little bit more obscure,\nbut it's possible they can turn up.\n\n1318\n01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,140\nSo I went ahead and threw them on there.\n\n1319\n01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:59,540\nBut the majority of these,\nyou will see show up on the exam.\n\n1320\n01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,740\nAnd then after that,\nI went ahead I went ahead and\n\n1321\n01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:05,910\njust checked off because some of\nthese can do more than one thing.\n\n1322\n01:02:05,910 --> 01:02:06,430\nRight?\n\n1323\n01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:11,020\nSo you might be able to do encryption as\nwell as handled digital signatures or\n\n1324\n01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:13,580\nbe a hashing function or\ndo key distribution.\n\n1325\n01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:14,602\nYou could do a key exchange.\n\n1326\n01:02:14,602 --> 01:02:15,610\n>> Alright.\n>> Right?\n\n1327\n01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:20,380\nSo I went ahead and categorized that\nto just layout which ones do what.\n\n1328\n01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:23,280\nAnd I found that this format\nworked really well for\n\n1329\n01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,680\nme, as far as being able\nto remember cuz in my mind,\n\n1330\n01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:31,680\nI'm a very visual person, so I'd kind\nof remembered what this looked like.\n\n1331\n01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:35,730\nSo when I'd see them on the exam,\nin my head I would picture where it was on\n\n1332\n01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:37,660\nthe chart, and\nthat's what would help me remember.\n\n1333\n01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:40,060\n>> The top was your asymmetrics,\nthe middle your symmetrics, and\n\n1334\n01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,940\ndown at the bottom,\nit was your hashing algorithms.\n\n1335\n01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:44,620\n>> Right, and that worked for me,\nmight not work for you at all, right?\n\n1336\n01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:46,820\nYou might say Don this is\nthe dumbest thing I've ever heard.\n\n1337\n01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:47,990\nSo\n>> We don't all have\n\n1338\n01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:49,440\nphotographic memories or anything.\n\n1339\n01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,060\nFlash cards were my thing.\n\n1340\n01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:54,150\nI wrote out flash cards, and I would\njust sit there, old school index cards,\n\n1341\n01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:56,890\nnot computerized at all,\njust flip them over.\n\n1342\n01:02:56,890 --> 01:02:58,920\nAnd anytime you got a chance,\nyou'd just sit there and\n\n1343\n01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,200\ngo through them and just memorize it.\n\n1344\n01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,920\n>> Yep.\nSo let's talk about a few of these.\n\n1345\n01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,160\nSome of these are very, very common,\nsome of them not so much.\n\n1346\n01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:10,110\nSome of these are actually\nthe same algorithm more than once.\n\n1347\n01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:12,060\n>> Alright.\n>> Like you'll notice here I've got Shaw\n\n1348\n01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:13,060\n1, Shaw 128, Shaw 256.\n\n1349\n01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:16,610\nAlright, well,\nthose are actually all the same.\n\n1350\n01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:20,390\nThey are all the secure hashing algorithm,\nright.\n\n1351\n01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:23,060\nThe difference is how long the hash is,\nright.\n\n1352\n01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:26,920\n>> Right.\nThat makes the digest that it creates.\n\n1353\n01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,300\n>> Shaw 128 is 128 bits.\n\n1354\n01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,970\nShaw 256 is 256 bits.\n\n1355\n01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:32,600\nAnd so,\nthere's actually a SHA- 512 out now.\n\n1356\n01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,025\nSo there's stronger ones, and\nobviously stronger is better.\n\n1357\n01:03:36,025 --> 01:03:42,667\nSHA-1 was really designed as\na replacement for MD-5, Message Digest 5.\n\n1358\n01:03:42,667 --> 01:03:45,617\nAnd MD-5 had some collision\nattacks that were starting\n\n1359\n01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:49,250\nto become a little more common, and\nSHA-1 was supposed to fix that.\n\n1360\n01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:52,958\nI say supposed to, well there's some\ncollision attacks out for SHA-1 now.\n\n1361\n01:03:52,958 --> 01:03:55,526\n>> Right.\n>> Also there's some questionable ethics\n\n1362\n01:03:55,526 --> 01:03:59,532\nbehind the NSA, the National Security\nAdministration, here in the US.\n\n1363\n01:03:59,532 --> 01:04:00,631\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n1364\n01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:03,170\nhow they did the random\nnumber generation for it.\n\n1365\n01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:05,720\n>> Right.\n>> So, the general consensus today is that\n\n1366\n01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:09,330\nyou should stay away from SHA-1,\nSHA-2, and SHA-3.\n\n1367\n01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:10,570\n>> And that brings up a good point that,\n\n1368\n01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:12,400\nI don't think we had mentioned in\none of those earlier episodes,\n\n1369\n01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,201\nthat they will call out in your\nCompTIA study information.\n\n1370\n01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,870\nIs when you're picking an algorithm,\n\n1371\n01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:20,630\nyou really wanna pick one that\nhas been tested thoroughly.\n\n1372\n01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:23,644\nYou don't wanna just go, and\ngreat there's this new algorithm out,\n\n1373\n01:04:23,644 --> 01:04:24,932\nwe're gonna start using it.\n\n1374\n01:04:24,932 --> 01:04:25,674\n>> Yeah.\n>> I mean,\n\n1375\n01:04:25,674 --> 01:04:29,333\nIt has to be analyzed by\nprofessionals that go through it,\n\n1376\n01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:33,683\nnon-biased people, cuz who knows\nwhat's inside that algorithm?\n\n1377\n01:04:33,683 --> 01:04:37,562\n>> Yeah, you know, AES, that guy right\nthere, a lot of people think, AES,\n\n1378\n01:04:37,562 --> 01:04:38,803\nthat's an algorithm.\n\n1379\n01:04:38,803 --> 01:04:40,625\nBut it really wasn't, it was a contest.\n\n1380\n01:04:40,625 --> 01:04:46,580\n>> Yeah, cuz it was originally, oh gosh,\nwhat was the name of it before it was AES?\n\n1381\n01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:50,360\nCuz it's the Advanced Encryption Standard.\n\n1382\n01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:54,339\nBut yeah, there's a contest,\nTwofish, Blowfish, Skipjack.\n\n1383\n01:04:54,339 --> 01:04:55,372\n>> There were like five of them.\n\n1384\n01:04:55,372 --> 01:04:56,510\n>> Yeah, that were in this.\n\n1385\n01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:57,333\n>> And so-\n>> Oh,\n\n1386\n01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:58,738\nit was the Rijndael was the one-\n>> Oh,\n\n1387\n01:04:58,738 --> 01:04:59,912\nthat's the name of the one that won.\n\n1388\n01:04:59,912 --> 01:05:00,596\n>> Rijndael became, yes.\n\n1389\n01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:02,876\n>> So, they had a contest,\nthe US government.\n\n1390\n01:05:02,876 --> 01:05:05,495\nThey said we need a new encryption\nalgorithm that we can trust,\n\n1391\n01:05:05,495 --> 01:05:07,000\nthat's standardized, or whatever.\n\n1392\n01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,440\nAnd so, they opened it up to the public,\nthey said, come up with an algorithm and\n\n1393\n01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,280\nenter it in.\n\n1394\n01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,930\nAnd so, Mike you just rattled\noff most of the contestants,\n\n1395\n01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:15,897\nis it Rijndael is that\nhow you pronounce it?\n\n1396\n01:05:15,897 --> 01:05:16,756\n>> Rijndael, yeah.\n\n1397\n01:05:16,756 --> 01:05:19,042\nIt's R-H, R-H-I-\n>> I-J-\n\n1398\n01:05:19,042 --> 01:05:20,634\n>> Yeah, it's pronounced Rhinedale, yeah.\n\n1399\n01:05:20,634 --> 01:05:26,281\n>> [LAUGH] But, it's a combination\nof the two authors' names,\n\n1400\n01:05:26,281 --> 01:05:29,956\nand it's Joan Daemen and-\n>> I can't think of the other guy's name.\n\n1401\n01:05:29,956 --> 01:05:32,359\n>> Yeah, anyhow, it-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1402\n01:05:32,359 --> 01:05:35,576\n>> But basically,\npeople entered in these algorithms, and\n\n1403\n01:05:35,576 --> 01:05:38,630\nover five years,\nthey tested these algorithms.\n\n1404\n01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:40,305\nSo, it took them five\nyears to select a winner.\n\n1405\n01:05:40,305 --> 01:05:42,290\n>> Right.\n>> So, by the time they picked Rijndael,\n\n1406\n01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:46,880\nor however you say it, as the winner,\nwell, that's what became AES.\n\n1407\n01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,820\nThey just renamed it AES.\n\n1408\n01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,885\nAnd now it was released to the public, but\neven then, people still didn't trust it.\n\n1409\n01:05:51,885 --> 01:05:54,000\n>> Right.\n>> It'll take a good ten years for\n\n1410\n01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,115\npeople to feel comfortable\nwith a encryption algorithm.\n\n1411\n01:05:57,115 --> 01:06:02,361\nAnd that's we have thinks like Triple DES,\nwhich technically came out in the 70s.\n\n1412\n01:06:02,361 --> 01:06:03,970\n>> Right?\nIt's over 30 years old but\n\n1413\n01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:06,740\nwe still use it today,\nbecause it's very trusted.\n\n1414\n01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:11,210\nWe know that there's no weakness in\nthe algorithm that can easily be broken.\n\n1415\n01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:13,490\nPeople just have to brute force the thing.\n\n1416\n01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:15,830\nWell, when something brand new comes out,\n\n1417\n01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:18,390\nlike IDEA is kind of going\nthrough this right now.\n\n1418\n01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:22,245\nWhere, I say it's new,\nit's over ten years old.\n\n1419\n01:06:22,245 --> 01:06:24,785\n>> Right.\n>> But people are still just not confident\n\n1420\n01:06:24,785 --> 01:06:26,360\nthat there might not be\nsome weakness in there.\n\n1421\n01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:32,134\nSo, security world is slow to adopt new\nalgorithms, and that's a good thing.\n\n1422\n01:06:32,134 --> 01:06:35,215\nAll right, so\nsome of these other ones like RC4.\n\n1423\n01:06:35,215 --> 01:06:40,047\nRC4 was a really common one back in\nthe day, but it was a stream cipher, and\n\n1424\n01:06:40,047 --> 01:06:41,360\nit was weak.\n\n1425\n01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,660\nBut back then computers were slower,\nit didn't matter.\n\n1426\n01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:47,350\nToday, you can use a single computer and\nbreak RC4 in short order.\n\n1427\n01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:51,770\nSo, some of these have kind of lost favor,\nand they've been replaced by other ones.\n\n1428\n01:06:51,770 --> 01:06:54,570\n>> Yeah, because there's RC6 out now,\nRC5, RC6, and\n\n1429\n01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:58,940\nthey changed over to a block cipher\nmethod, and much more secure.\n\n1430\n01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:00,630\n>> And increased their key lengths.\n\n1431\n01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:03,250\nThey do a lot of stuff\nto make them stronger.\n\n1432\n01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:06,660\nDES is an interesting one,\nthe Digital Encrypting Standard.\n\n1433\n01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:10,190\nIt was originally developed\nby IBM back in the 70s.\n\n1434\n01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:12,370\nAnd it was strong back then.\n\n1435\n01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:14,693\nBut the key length on it,\nwas it 40-bit, or 54-bit?\n\n1436\n01:07:14,693 --> 01:07:19,176\nI think it was 64-bit, but there was,\nwhat 8-bit used for parity or something.\n\n1437\n01:07:19,176 --> 01:07:22,810\nSo, you ended up with a 56-bit key,\nwhich was not all that long.\n\n1438\n01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:23,880\n>> But back then it was okay.\n\n1439\n01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:24,700\n>> It was perfect.\n\n1440\n01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:27,369\n>> But it wasn't as strong as\nthey wanted it to be, and so\n\n1441\n01:07:27,369 --> 01:07:29,280\nthey tried to come up with something new.\n\n1442\n01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:32,560\nAnd what they did was Triple DES,\nand all Triple DES does is,\n\n1443\n01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:35,510\nit uses that,\neffectively a 56-bit key, right?\n\n1444\n01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:37,316\nSo it uses that to encrypt your data once.\n\n1445\n01:07:37,316 --> 01:07:38,059\n>> Right.\n\n1446\n01:07:38,059 --> 01:07:39,534\n>> And\nthen it encrypts the encrypted data.\n\n1447\n01:07:39,534 --> 01:07:40,253\n>> Right.\n\n1448\n01:07:40,253 --> 01:07:43,140\n>> And then it encrypts the encrypted,\nencrypted data, right?\n\n1449\n01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:45,760\nSo it's applying itself three times.\n\n1450\n01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,600\nAnd so the end result is the equivalent\nof you having a longer key length.\n\n1451\n01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,587\nNow-\n>> Almost seems like you're cheating\n\n1452\n01:07:51,587 --> 01:07:52,230\nthough at that point, doesn't it?\n\n1453\n01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:54,353\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like yeah, it's not strong enough,\n\n1454\n01:07:54,353 --> 01:07:55,097\nwe'll just do it again.\n\n1455\n01:07:55,097 --> 01:07:56,850\n[LAUGH]\n>> And there's a big debate right now,\n\n1456\n01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:59,317\nover how many bit strength\nyou actually get out of it.\n\n1457\n01:07:59,317 --> 01:08:03,782\nBecause there was a flaw in the algorithm\nthat was found where the second encryption\n\n1458\n01:08:03,782 --> 01:08:05,271\nis somewhat predictable.\n\n1459\n01:08:05,271 --> 01:08:06,625\nAnd so, those bits don't count.\n\n1460\n01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:07,367\n>> Oh, wow.\n>> And so\n\n1461\n01:08:07,367 --> 01:08:10,353\nafter you do this triple encryption,\nit ends up being,\n\n1462\n01:08:10,353 --> 01:08:14,650\nI think it's something like a 108 bits or\nsomething of actual key strength.\n\n1463\n01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:17,630\nI'd have to look it up, but there is some\ndebate over whether you count that or not.\n\n1464\n01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:18,350\n>> Yeah.\n>> You won't\n\n1465\n01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:19,310\nneed to know that on the exam.\n\n1466\n01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:22,810\nOn the exam, just know that it's\nreally applying itself three times.\n\n1467\n01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:26,650\nAnd Triple DES is very common,\nalmost everything supports Triple DES.\n\n1468\n01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:29,970\nYou see a lot of people\nmoving over to AES though.\n\n1469\n01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:33,002\nLike with Cisco firewalls, and\nbuilding their VPN tunnels.\n\n1470\n01:08:33,002 --> 01:08:34,771\n>> Right.\n>> They're really push you to go to\n\n1471\n01:08:34,771 --> 01:08:36,299\nAES-256, or some of those.\n\n1472\n01:08:36,299 --> 01:08:39,541\n>> WPA2 takes advantage of AES as well,\nso.\n\n1473\n01:08:39,541 --> 01:08:40,261\n>> Yep.\n\n1474\n01:08:40,261 --> 01:08:43,786\nBut there are a lot of competitors that\nare out there like Blowfish, and Twofish,\n\n1475\n01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:47,159\nthose guys, which are perfectly good\nalgorithms, but weren't selected for\n\n1476\n01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:48,300\none reason, or another.\n\n1477\n01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:49,708\nMaybe not-\n>> Could have been performance-\n\n1478\n01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:51,038\n>> Performance is a big thing.\n\n1479\n01:08:51,038 --> 01:08:51,903\n>> It doesn't have to be strength,\nit could be performance.\n\n1480\n01:08:51,903 --> 01:08:56,140\nLike Triple DES is stronger than DES, but\nnow we're doing that thing three times.\n\n1481\n01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:57,353\nWe are slowing it down,\n\n1482\n01:08:57,353 --> 01:09:00,460\ntaking a big performance hit\nwhen we move to Triple DES, so.\n\n1483\n01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:05,750\nIt's always a balancing act looking for\nsecurity, and performance, and\n\n1484\n01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,210\ntrying to find that middle ground.\n\n1485\n01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:07,880\n>> Yep.\n\n1486\n01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:10,871\nNow, some of these,\nlike the Diffie-Hellman, stuff here.\n\n1487\n01:09:10,871 --> 01:09:14,820\nI've got it entered in as\nasymmetric encryption.\n\n1488\n01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:17,510\nAnd you might be saying,\nwait a minute, Don, Diffie-Hellman,\n\n1489\n01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:19,056\nthat's like key exchange protocol.\n\n1490\n01:09:19,056 --> 01:09:22,040\nRight, it's way over here, I've got\nthem flagged for key exchange and stuff.\n\n1491\n01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:26,880\nWhat Diffie-Hellman does is this\nis a way to securely hand your\n\n1492\n01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,590\nkeys from one side to the other.\n\n1493\n01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:33,305\nAnd when we do asymmetric encryption, and\nsymmetric, if we're doing the hybrid model\n\n1494\n01:09:33,305 --> 01:09:37,270\nwe do both, you're very likely using\none of the Diffie-Hellman algorithms.\n\n1495\n01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:40,725\nThere's several of them,\nthere's Diffie-Hellman 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and\n\n1496\n01:09:40,725 --> 01:09:42,187\nI think there's a few others now.\n\n1497\n01:09:42,187 --> 01:09:43,126\n>> I think so.\n\n1498\n01:09:43,126 --> 01:09:46,296\n>> And basically they're handing off,\nand when they do that,\n\n1499\n01:09:46,296 --> 01:09:49,146\nthey're doing their own encrypted session.\n\n1500\n01:09:49,146 --> 01:09:52,601\nSo, Diffie-Hellman provides\nasymmetric encryption,\n\n1501\n01:09:52,601 --> 01:09:56,100\njust for the key hand-off,\nnot for your session.\n\n1502\n01:09:56,100 --> 01:10:00,860\nAnd so that's why I don't have encryption\nchecked over here, because Diffie-Hellman\n\n1503\n01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:04,810\nwill encrypt the keys during transit,\nbut it won't encrypt your data.\n\n1504\n01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:08,120\nSo Diffie-Hellman by itself is not enough,\nyou've gotta use something else.\n\n1505\n01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:11,840\nSo, what we normally do, and you'll see\nthis if you ever set up a VPN tunnel,\n\n1506\n01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,530\nis you have multiple phases.\n\n1507\n01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:17,740\nAnd when you set up the phases, the\ninitial connection, that's asymmetric, and\n\n1508\n01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:22,910\nyou'll be using something like Triple DES,\nor AES for that initial connection.\n\n1509\n01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:25,520\nThen you're using Diffie-Hellman\nto exchange your keys.\n\n1510\n01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,510\nThen you go into phase two,\nwhere you do your symmetric.\n\n1511\n01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:34,352\nAnd you'll switch off to something like,\nwell, Triple DES or AES.\n\n1512\n01:10:34,352 --> 01:10:35,987\nSo, you'll jump into one of those guys,\nand then,\n\n1513\n01:10:35,987 --> 01:10:37,410\nyou'll actually continue your session on.\n\n1514\n01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:41,470\nSo, a lot of these have to\nbe used in combination.\n\n1515\n01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:42,620\nAnd that's where we have frameworks,\n\n1516\n01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:46,395\nlike the IPSec framework,\nInternet Protocol Security.\n\n1517\n01:10:46,395 --> 01:10:49,800\nIPSec allows us to pick and\nchoose the protocols,\n\n1518\n01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:54,240\nthe algorithms that we wanna use for\nencryption, for integrity, right?\n\n1519\n01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:56,250\nWhat are we gonna use for\nour digital signatures?\n\n1520\n01:10:56,250 --> 01:11:00,140\nAnd you pick all that, and it's consistent\nbetween your system and other systems.\n\n1521\n01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:03,422\nSo I might be running Mac OS, and\nMike might be running Linux, but\n\n1522\n01:11:03,422 --> 01:11:07,620\nwe can build an IPSec session between us,\ncuz we're using that common framework.\n\n1523\n01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:10,535\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n1524\n01:11:10,535 --> 01:11:12,882\n>> But yeah, so\nthis is basically the one that I use.\n\n1525\n01:11:12,882 --> 01:11:13,675\nAnd I put some on here for\n\n1526\n01:11:13,675 --> 01:11:14,588\nhistorical purposes-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1527\n01:11:14,588 --> 01:11:16,293\n>> Like MD2 and MD4, but\n\n1528\n01:11:16,293 --> 01:11:19,710\non the exam you're not\nlikely gonna see those.\n\n1529\n01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:22,364\nIt's not hard to remember\nthough because MD2, 4, and 5,\n\n1530\n01:11:22,364 --> 01:11:24,110\nthey're really all the same.\n\n1531\n01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:26,024\nIts just getting stronger each time,\nincreasing the key length.\n\n1532\n01:11:26,024 --> 01:11:27,380\n>> Exactly, just longer keys.\n\n1533\n01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:30,090\nAnd then there's a couple we don't have\nlisted on there that we've talked about in\n\n1534\n01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:32,090\nsome other episodes like CHAP and PAP.\n\n1535\n01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:37,250\nWhat else, I think WPA, WPA2, and WEP.\n\n1536\n01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:39,830\nAnd we've covered those\nin some other episodes.\n\n1537\n01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:42,730\n>> Yeah, and I didn't put those on\nthe chart because they're not really\n\n1538\n01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:45,540\nencryption algorithms themselves.\n\n1539\n01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:47,426\nThey're really processes\nthat use something else.\n\n1540\n01:11:47,426 --> 01:11:51,000\nMike, you mentioned it,\nWPA2 uses AES, right?\n\n1541\n01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,984\n>> Mm-hm, and\nCHAP is really an authentication protocol,\n\n1542\n01:11:52,984 --> 01:11:54,199\nnot really an encryption-\n>> Yeah,\n\n1543\n01:11:54,199 --> 01:11:56,167\nChallenge Handshake\nAuthentication Protocol.\n\n1544\n01:11:56,167 --> 01:11:58,708\nIt uses a hash of your password.\n\n1545\n01:11:58,708 --> 01:11:59,917\nI think it uses MD5, doesn't it?\n\n1546\n01:11:59,917 --> 01:12:00,418\n>> It uses MD5.\n\n1547\n01:12:00,418 --> 01:12:01,162\n>> Okay, yeah.\n\n1548\n01:12:01,162 --> 01:12:04,007\nSo it's just using some\nof the other protocols.\n\n1549\n01:12:04,007 --> 01:12:05,295\nNTLM, right?\n\n1550\n01:12:05,295 --> 01:12:06,793\nThe NT Lan Manager.\n\n1551\n01:12:06,793 --> 01:12:11,594\nThat was the old authentication\nthat Microsoft used before\n\n1552\n01:12:11,594 --> 01:12:13,950\nthey went to Kerberos.\n\n1553\n01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:20,400\nAnd NTLM and NTLM v2, they used hash\npasswords, but they were fairly weak.\n\n1554\n01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,590\nAnd so they were susceptible to\nthings like rainbow table attacks and\n\n1555\n01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:24,210\nstuff like that.\n\n1556\n01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:26,224\nSo, they've kinda moved away from them.\n\n1557\n01:12:26,224 --> 01:12:29,528\nSo NTLM it's not an encryption\nstandard itself,\n\n1558\n01:12:29,528 --> 01:12:33,234\nit's a technology that uses\nthe encryption standard.\n\n1559\n01:12:33,234 --> 01:12:35,935\nWhat else do we have, PGP, right?\n\n1560\n01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:37,193\n>> Oh, yeah, pretty good privacy.\n>> And GPG,\n\n1561\n01:12:37,193 --> 01:12:39,786\nwhich is the GNU Privacy Guard.\n\n1562\n01:12:39,786 --> 01:12:44,235\nIt's just an open source\nkind of equivalent to PGP.\n\n1563\n01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:47,238\nThey allow you to encrypt things,\nand let me tell you,\n\n1564\n01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:50,845\nif you wanna do encrypted email,\nGPG really is the best way to go.\n\n1565\n01:12:50,845 --> 01:12:55,142\nEncrypted email is so flaky, whether\nservers are gonna support it or not, and\n\n1566\n01:12:55,142 --> 01:12:58,736\nyou just don't know if you'll get\nend to end encryption with it.\n\n1567\n01:12:58,736 --> 01:13:01,900\nBut with GPG, you get that.\n\n1568\n01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:05,950\nYou take your data, and you encrypt it\nyourself, right there on your desktop.\n\n1569\n01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:08,130\nAnd then you paste the encrypted\ndata in the email.\n\n1570\n01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:11,340\nSo it's encrypted when it goes\nin to your email client, and\n\n1571\n01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:12,550\nyou send it to the destination.\n\n1572\n01:13:12,550 --> 01:13:14,800\nWhatever server it goes through,\nwhatever network it crosses,\n\n1573\n01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,840\nthat data is encrypted\ncuz you did it yourself.\n\n1574\n01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,285\nAnd the person on the other end receives\nit, and if they have your key, or\n\n1575\n01:13:21,285 --> 01:13:25,360\nif you encrypted it with their key,\nthey can decrypt it and they can read it.\n\n1576\n01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,255\nBut if you encrypted it with somebody\nelse's key, they can't read it.\n\n1577\n01:13:28,255 --> 01:13:31,924\nAnd so it insures that you\nget encryption end to end.\n\n1578\n01:13:31,924 --> 01:13:36,542\nA lot of public email services like Gmail,\nMicrosoft Hotmail,\n\n1579\n01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:42,000\nYahoo mail, they all share their keys\nwith the United States government.\n\n1580\n01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,280\nThe US companies, they share it there,\nand so that data is not private.\n\n1581\n01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:47,550\nWe've seen that time and time again.\n\n1582\n01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:49,840\nBut if you use something like GPG,\n\n1583\n01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,400\nyour data's encrypted before it\neven gets into their system.\n\n1584\n01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,740\nSo even if they turn over access to\nyour accounts to a government agency or\n\n1585\n01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:58,530\nwhatever, they won't be\nable to read your data.\n\n1586\n01:13:58,530 --> 01:14:00,400\nThey won't have the keys to do it.\n\n1587\n01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,990\nSo, these technologies,\n\n1588\n01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:06,360\nwhile they're not encryption themselves,\nthey allow you to use the encryption.\n\n1589\n01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,609\nThey are the tool to make that happen.\n\n1590\n01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:09,129\n>> Right.\n>> And they're very, very handy.\n\n1591\n01:14:09,129 --> 01:14:11,977\n>> And when it comes to the exam, that's\nwhat they're really gonna be asking you\n\n1592\n01:14:11,977 --> 01:14:13,628\nis, what would you use\ngiven this scenario?\n\n1593\n01:14:13,628 --> 01:14:17,745\nAnd so if the choice is to send an\nencrypted email or send data via email but\n\n1594\n01:14:17,745 --> 01:14:22,485\nyou wanna protect it, then we'd be picking\nsomething like that, like PGP or GNG.\n\n1595\n01:14:22,485 --> 01:14:26,800\n>> Now they added a few to the list\nwith the new version of the exam.\n\n1596\n01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,322\nSo the 401 version of the exam\nwhich just came out this year,\n\n1597\n01:14:29,322 --> 01:14:31,336\nI guess it depends on when\nyou're watching this.\n\n1598\n01:14:31,336 --> 01:14:35,153\nSo in 2014, [LAUGH] and they added\nDiffie-Hellman, which we've talked about.\n\n1599\n01:14:35,153 --> 01:14:37,250\n>> Right.\n>> And they added DHE and\n\n1600\n01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:41,917\nECDHE which are kinda silly\nbecause DHE is Diffie-Hellman,\n\n1601\n01:14:41,917 --> 01:14:45,246\nECDHE is elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman.\n\n1602\n01:14:45,246 --> 01:14:47,829\n>> Right.\n>> So if Diffie-Hellman using elliptic\n\n1603\n01:14:47,829 --> 01:14:52,426\ncurve technologies which we talk about\na little bit when we're talking about\n\n1604\n01:14:52,426 --> 01:14:54,400\nquantum cryptography.\n\n1605\n01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:59,010\nSo that's a newer technology to make\nit far more difficult to predict keys.\n\n1606\n01:14:59,010 --> 01:14:59,660\n>> So instead of MD4,\n\n1607\n01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:01,896\nMD5, they're just adding letters\nto the beginning of their name.\n\n1608\n01:15:01,896 --> 01:15:02,975\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1609\n01:15:02,975 --> 01:15:04,101\nLet's just go crazy with it.\n\n1610\n01:15:04,101 --> 01:15:06,160\nSo those are some.\n\n1611\n01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:11,300\nThey also call out other tools\nlike transport encryption.\n\n1612\n01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:14,500\nAnd we mentioned SSL, Secure Socket Layer,\n\n1613\n01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:20,280\nwhich uses asymmetric and symmetric when\nyou communicate, very common on the web.\n\n1614\n01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,600\nSSL can be applied to other things though.\n\n1615\n01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:27,230\nAnd when you do, like if you apply SSL\nto SMTP, or SSL to POP3, or whatever,\n\n1616\n01:15:27,230 --> 01:15:30,314\nthey call that transport layer security,\nor TLS.\n\n1617\n01:15:30,314 --> 01:15:36,472\nTLS is just the application of SSL,\nthe same technology, to non web traffic.\n\n1618\n01:15:36,472 --> 01:15:40,088\n>> Right.\n>> So I know we use TLS a lot with email.\n\n1619\n01:15:40,088 --> 01:15:43,741\nEmail is a very common place for\nit cuz those aren't' secure, but\n\n1620\n01:15:43,741 --> 01:15:45,852\nyou can do it with FTP.\n\n1621\n01:15:45,852 --> 01:15:47,322\nFTP is not secure.\n\n1622\n01:15:47,322 --> 01:15:52,262\nYou can tunnel it over SSH, they call\nthat SFTP, or you can apply TLS to it.\n\n1623\n01:15:52,262 --> 01:15:53,102\nAnd that's called FTPS.\n\n1624\n01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:55,417\nSo you'll see that technology there.\n\n1625\n01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:57,170\n>> There's the other part\nwe were talking about.\n\n1626\n01:15:57,170 --> 01:15:59,040\nI think Wes and I were doing that episode.\n\n1627\n01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,920\nPut a CSS on the front, a CSS on the back.\n\n1628\n01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:04,230\nThe main thing you get, they are really\nalmost the same thing, SSL, TLS.\n\n1629\n01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:07,220\nJust understand they're not\ncompatible with each other.\n\n1630\n01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:09,786\nThat if one end is settup to use SSL,\nthe other end is using TLS,\n\n1631\n01:16:09,786 --> 01:16:11,396\nyou can't negotiate security there.\n\n1632\n01:16:11,396 --> 01:16:14,043\nSo either everything's SSL or\neverything's TLS.\n\n1633\n01:16:14,043 --> 01:16:17,171\nAnd you know how I remember\nwhere the S is, for FTP?\n\n1634\n01:16:17,171 --> 01:16:21,659\nSo, when you use SSH, you have to\nbuild the SSH tunnel first, and\n\n1635\n01:16:21,659 --> 01:16:23,215\nthen FTP runs over it.\n\n1636\n01:16:23,215 --> 01:16:24,492\nSo it's SFTP.\n\n1637\n01:16:24,492 --> 01:16:25,880\n>> Right.\n>> But with SSL,\n\n1638\n01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:30,030\nyou connect with FTP first to\ndo the certificate transfers.\n\n1639\n01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:33,113\nSo you get the TLS session,\nand you build it after.\n\n1640\n01:16:33,113 --> 01:16:34,075\nSo it's FTPS.\n\n1641\n01:16:34,075 --> 01:16:34,831\n>> That makes sense.\n\n1642\n01:16:34,831 --> 01:16:35,551\n>> That's how I remember it.\n\n1643\n01:16:35,551 --> 01:16:37,095\n>> You know I'll remember\nthat from this day forward.\n\n1644\n01:16:37,095 --> 01:16:39,598\n[LAUGH]\n>> But I also remember not to use FTPS\n\n1645\n01:16:39,598 --> 01:16:42,629\nbecause [LAUGH] not a lot of\nstuff seems to support it.\n\n1646\n01:16:42,629 --> 01:16:45,165\nI trust SSH.\n\n1647\n01:16:45,165 --> 01:16:47,557\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n1648\n01:16:47,557 --> 01:16:51,870\nSo the other thing to call out though\nis strong versus weak ciphers.\n\n1649\n01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:57,950\nWe need to understand that, that not\nevery cipher is strong as the next one.\n\n1650\n01:16:57,950 --> 01:17:02,070\nSome are weaker than others,\nDES is old and it's weak.\n\n1651\n01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:04,840\nAnd it was great back in the day,\nbut that day is gone.\n\n1652\n01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:07,504\nAnd so\ntoday we need to use something stronger.\n\n1653\n01:17:07,504 --> 01:17:09,878\nAES256 is strong.\n\n1654\n01:17:09,878 --> 01:17:13,580\nWe want to use that if we can, today.\n\n1655\n01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:19,502\nWell, when we start covering the SY0-801\nexam four years from now, right?\n\n1656\n01:17:19,502 --> 01:17:20,297\nThen.\n\n1657\n01:17:20,297 --> 01:17:22,236\n>> [LAUGH] We're gonna\nbe laughing at that.\n\n1658\n01:17:22,236 --> 01:17:22,770\n>> I know.\n\n1659\n01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:26,009\nThat might be strong anymore and we'll be\nlike, oh if you're not running AES4096,\n\n1660\n01:17:26,009 --> 01:17:26,797\nthen you're a joke.\n\n1661\n01:17:26,797 --> 01:17:29,479\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n1662\n01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:30,593\nThat's how [INAUDIBLE] things change.\n\n1663\n01:17:30,593 --> 01:17:32,900\nSo we just need to be aware\nthat things do change.\n\n1664\n01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:36,680\nDon't assume that vendors will\ndefault to the strongest stuff,\n\n1665\n01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,410\nbecause oftentimes they don't.\n\n1666\n01:17:38,410 --> 01:17:41,225\nAnd even worse, they can do negotiations.\n\n1667\n01:17:41,225 --> 01:17:44,160\nYou see this from Cisco, where they'll\nsupport more than one standard.\n\n1668\n01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:48,240\nAnd they might support some very strong\nones, but they support the low ones also.\n\n1669\n01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:51,472\nAnd when people connect,\nthey might negotiate the low ones, and\n\n1670\n01:17:51,472 --> 01:17:54,267\nyou think you have a nice\nsecure network and you don't.\n\n1671\n01:17:54,267 --> 01:17:58,155\nSo don't trust that the vendors\nwill take care of that for you.\n\n1672\n01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:02,740\nAnd the last one is something that I don't\nreally like, which is key stretching.\n\n1673\n01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:03,338\n>> Key stretching!\n\n1674\n01:18:03,338 --> 01:18:05,753\nMake them longer and stronger.\n\n1675\n01:18:05,753 --> 01:18:06,810\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1676\n01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:11,249\nSome of these older algorithms were not\nwritten to be able to support longer\n\n1677\n01:18:11,249 --> 01:18:12,170\nkey lengths.\n\n1678\n01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:14,300\nAnd some of them would have to\nrewrite them to do that, but\n\n1679\n01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,220\nsome of them it's just not possible.\n\n1680\n01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:22,440\nSo you can apply something\nlike key stretching,\n\n1681\n01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:27,900\nwhich is where basically you take the key\nand you do like what triple does.\n\n1682\n01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:28,860\nWhat is triple doing?\n\n1683\n01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:33,610\nIt's applying itself over and over and\nover again, to make that key longer,\n\n1684\n01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:36,020\nto make it a stronger form\nof encryption and it worked.\n\n1685\n01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:36,590\n>> It does work.\n\n1686\n01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:37,280\nYeah.\n\n1687\n01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:38,550\n>> The problem is,\n\n1688\n01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:42,690\nyou're not encrypting something once,\nyou're encrypting it more than once.\n\n1689\n01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:46,880\nAnd so it's intensive, it's software or\nhardware intensive to do that encryption.\n\n1690\n01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,680\nSo it's not the best\nsolution in my opinion.\n\n1691\n01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,150\n>> I'd much rather use a stronger cypher.\n\n1692\n01:18:51,150 --> 01:18:53,917\n>> Absolutely.\nBut, if a cipher gets broken and\n\n1693\n01:18:53,917 --> 01:18:57,453\nno one has written a new one yet,\nwhat do you do?\n\n1694\n01:18:57,453 --> 01:18:58,750\nAre you just screwed?\n\n1695\n01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,190\nNo.\nYou got to find something.\n\n1696\n01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:03,520\nAnd so, key stretching is designed\nto be the stop gap measure\n\n1697\n01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:07,160\nwhen one of your ciphers gets broken,\nnot your cipher but\n\n1698\n01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:10,320\none of these standard ciphers\nthat are out there gets broken,\n\n1699\n01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:16,097\nwe can use key stretching to get by until\na replacement comes out to cover us.\n\n1700\n01:19:16,097 --> 01:19:17,125\nAll right.\n>> And you were talking about that\n\n1701\n01:19:17,125 --> 01:19:17,732\nduring the break.\n\n1702\n01:19:17,732 --> 01:19:19,525\nHow many times does that go around?\n\n1703\n01:19:19,525 --> 01:19:20,274\n>> I'm shocked.\n\n1704\n01:19:20,274 --> 01:19:21,998\n>> PBKDF2.\n\n1705\n01:19:21,998 --> 01:19:24,273\n>> Yeah.\nSo the [LAUGH] I always try and\n\n1706\n01:19:24,273 --> 01:19:29,833\npull up documentation and stuff before the\nshow to make sure what I say is accurate.\n\n1707\n01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:34,700\nAnd I was like, PBKDF2 it's a standard.\n\n1708\n01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:37,120\nIt's an RC, it's out there.\n\n1709\n01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,068\nHow many times do they\nrecommend iterating,\n\n1710\n01:19:39,068 --> 01:19:40,974\ncycling through that encryption process?\n\n1711\n01:19:40,974 --> 01:19:45,624\nAnd in my mind I'm like,\nthree is triple des right?\n\n1712\n01:19:45,624 --> 01:19:47,168\nThree accepted, so maybe ten?\n\n1713\n01:19:47,168 --> 01:19:48,917\n>> Five, ten, yeah.\n\n1714\n01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:50,785\n[LAUGH]\n>> So I was on [INAUDIBLE] the internet\n\n1715\n01:19:50,785 --> 01:19:51,917\nand it said 1000.\n\n1716\n01:19:51,917 --> 01:19:53,667\n[LAUGH] And I was like 1000 times,\nyou're kidding me.\n\n1717\n01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:55,935\nSo I pulled the actual\nRFC before the show and\n\n1718\n01:19:55,935 --> 01:19:58,700\nsure enough the recommended\niteration is 1000.\n\n1719\n01:19:58,700 --> 01:19:59,920\n>> That's impressive.\n\n1720\n01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,340\n>> They want you to basically\ncycle the data 1000 times.\n\n1721\n01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:04,900\nNow that sounds crazy, right?\n\n1722\n01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:06,970\nWell with modern computers they can do it.\n\n1723\n01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:09,450\nAnd sure it's gonna result in a delay but\nit's not that significant.\n\n1724\n01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:10,400\n>> Right.\n>> And so\n\n1725\n01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:15,290\nyou can get considerably stronger keys\nout of a weaker algorithm by doing that.\n\n1726\n01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:18,000\nJust understand that it's\nnot the best solution.\n\n1727\n01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,270\nIt's really designed as a stop gap.\n\n1728\n01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:20,910\n>> Right exactly, temporary fix.\n\n1729\n01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:23,160\nLittle band aid for it.\n\n1730\n01:20:24,170 --> 01:20:27,360\n>> All right now, we've talked about\nkeys and how important they are.\n\n1731\n01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:28,685\nAll right, a lot of this stuff.\n\n1732\n01:20:28,685 --> 01:20:31,365\nSo what we\n\n1733\n01:20:31,365 --> 01:20:35,225\nneed to understand is that there's a lot\nof different mechanisms behind the scene.\n\n1734\n01:20:35,225 --> 01:20:38,845\nSSL we've talked about in depth because\nthat's one that's the most common but\n\n1735\n01:20:38,845 --> 01:20:42,827\nwe also want to talk a little bit\nmore about how all those keys\n\n1736\n01:20:42,827 --> 01:20:46,907\ncan be trusted if this is the first\ntime you've talked to somebody.\n\n1737\n01:20:46,907 --> 01:20:49,657\nSo like if I go to Amazon's website and\nthey give me their key, how do\n\n1738\n01:20:49,657 --> 01:20:53,967\nI actually know that's a good key that I\ncan trust, that I can use reliably,right?\n\n1739\n01:20:53,967 --> 01:20:56,860\nSo to handle that,\nwe need to have something called a public\n\n1740\n01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:59,930\nkey infrastructure, and that's what we are\ngoing to talk about in the next segment.\n\n1741\n01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:01,760\n>> Okay.\n>> But we are out of time on this segment,\n\n1742\n01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,260\nso why don't we stop here.\n\n1743\n01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:05,900\nCan you think of anything\nelse we should throw out?\n\n1744\n01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:08,080\n>> No, I think we went through\nthe entire alphabet there [LAUGH].\n\n1745\n01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,160\n>> Let me just mention again,\nI will post the link to that spreadsheet,\n\n1746\n01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,700\nit's a Google Doc, so you will be\nable to get right into it and see it.\n\n1747\n01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:16,130\nAnd you can even save it to your own\nGoogle Docs if you wanna edit it and\n\n1748\n01:21:16,130 --> 01:21:17,180\nchange it.\n\n1749\n01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:18,670\nYou are more than welcome to do that.\n\n1750\n01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:20,690\nI don't copyright my junk or whatever.\n\n1751\n01:21:20,690 --> 01:21:21,300\nYou can have it.\n\n1752\n01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:21,850\n>> Not yet anyway.\n\n1753\n01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:26,455\n>> You can even say that you made it\nif you want, it won't hurt my feelings.\n\n1754\n01:21:26,455 --> 01:21:27,650\n[LAUGH] So anyhow.\n\n1755\n01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:29,450\nSo it'll be out there.\n\n1756\n01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:31,070\nBut we'll go ahead and stop here.\n\n1757\n01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:32,330\nStay tuned, when we get back,\n\n1758\n01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:35,733\npublic key infrastructure what's we're\ngonna hit next, so we'll see you then.\n\n1759\n01:21:35,733 --> 01:21:43,740\n[MUSIC]\n\n1760\n01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:47,040\nAll right welcome back everybody,\nso in our final segment,\n\n1761\n01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:51,001\nwe're gonna take a look at what's\ncalled a public key infrastructure.\n\n1762\n01:21:51,001 --> 01:21:53,090\nWe've been talking about these keys.\n\n1763\n01:21:53,090 --> 01:21:54,630\nPublic keys and private keys.\n\n1764\n01:21:54,630 --> 01:21:57,532\nAnd how our public keys,\nboy we can give them out to everybody.\n\n1765\n01:21:57,532 --> 01:21:59,160\n>> Alright.\n>> We don't care who gets them because\n\n1766\n01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:02,940\nthey're just used to encrypt\nnot to decrypt, right?\n\n1767\n01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:06,420\nWell, when you get a public key from\nsomebody, how do you know it's good?\n\n1768\n01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:08,580\nHow do you know it's trustworthy?\n\n1769\n01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:11,390\nHow do you know it's actually\ntheir public key and\n\n1770\n01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:14,540\nnot somebody impersonating that person.\n\n1771\n01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:18,260\nAnd the answer is,\nwe use a public key infrastructure.\n\n1772\n01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:22,270\nWe have servers called certificate\nauthorities that sit out\n\n1773\n01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:25,100\nthere on the internet, and\nthey validate for us whether or\n\n1774\n01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:29,340\nnot the certificate is truly\nwho it is they say they are.\n\n1775\n01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:31,102\nAnd whether we can trust that certificate.\n\n1776\n01:22:31,102 --> 01:22:35,020\nAnd whether it's still valid for\nthe purpose it was issued for.\n\n1777\n01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:37,640\nThat's really important,\nbecause without that piece,\n\n1778\n01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:40,010\nthe certificate's really aren't\nvery useful at all, right?\n\n1779\n01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:43,570\nIf you don't know that they're actually\nfrom the person that they say they are.\n\n1780\n01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:45,080\n>> Exactly.\nIt's all about trust, so\n\n1781\n01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:49,850\nthe certificate itself has to be issued\nby or issued from somebody that we trust.\n\n1782\n01:22:49,850 --> 01:22:54,870\nAnd then the certificates could be revoked\nat some point, or could lose their,\n\n1783\n01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:58,890\nwe could suspend or revoke it, and\nthen the certificate's no good anymore.\n\n1784\n01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:01,860\nBut, and we'll talk a little bit\nmore about it, there's no way for\n\n1785\n01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:03,120\nme to pull that certificate back.\n\n1786\n01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:06,470\nSo we gotta maintain a list of\ncertificates that have been revoked.\n\n1787\n01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:07,230\nAnd then I've got a validate it.\n\n1788\n01:23:07,230 --> 01:23:10,070\nI've gotta compare that list to the\ncertificate that's being presented to me\n\n1789\n01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:12,570\nand I gotta figure out if\nit has been revoked or not.\n\n1790\n01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:15,660\n>> Have you ever gone to a website and\nyou a message that says,\n\n1791\n01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:18,990\nwarning the SSL certificate for\nthis server is not trusted.\n\n1792\n01:23:18,990 --> 01:23:20,780\nOr actually here, I've got one.\n\n1793\n01:23:20,780 --> 01:23:22,030\n>> Our mail server.\n\n1794\n01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:23,770\nNo.\n>> No, no, we got good stuff on those.\n\n1795\n01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:24,880\n>> I think we fixed that, I don't know.\n\n1796\n01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:28,580\n>> No, I've got a lab server that I'm\ngonna be using next week that I know is\n\n1797\n01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:33,220\nset up this way, so it's got what's\ncalled a self signed certificate, right?\n\n1798\n01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:38,740\nSo, with those, we don't actually trust,\nsee, now I gotta remember the IP address.\n\n1799\n01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:40,110\nIs that it?\nThere we go.\n\n1800\n01:23:40,110 --> 01:23:41,870\nWe dont' actually trust it,\ncuz it's self signed.\n\n1801\n01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:43,260\nThey just generated it themselves.\n\n1802\n01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:44,890\nIt's not from somebody we trust.\n\n1803\n01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:46,130\nAnd so, you'll see a message like this.\n\n1804\n01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:48,530\nThe site's security\ncertificate is not trusted.\n\n1805\n01:23:48,530 --> 01:23:49,470\nAll right?\n\n1806\n01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:51,680\nWell, why do we get these messages?\n\n1807\n01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:56,210\nEvery certificate has certain\ncharacteristics applied to it, and if any\n\n1808\n01:23:56,210 --> 01:24:01,590\none of those characteristics is wrong or\nfails, we get this message right here.\n\n1809\n01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:02,880\nIt's not a trustworthy certificate.\n\n1810\n01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:03,910\nAll right?\n\n1811\n01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:06,270\nThe number one entry in\nthere is the hostname.\n\n1812\n01:24:06,270 --> 01:24:08,180\nRight.\nWhen a certificate is issued,\n\n1813\n01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:11,400\nit has a common name attached to it, and\n\n1814\n01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:13,580\nthat's the name of the server\nthe certificate's for.\n\n1815\n01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:17,450\nSo, like when you go to the ITProTV\nwebsite, our site is just itpro.tv.\n\n1816\n01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:22,040\nSo we have a certificate that's\nissued to that domain name.\n\n1817\n01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:23,410\nIf I were to take that certificate and\n\n1818\n01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:26,620\nstick it on another server,\nsay Don.itpro.tv.\n\n1819\n01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:29,680\nYou'd get a red flag because\nthe domain name doesn't match.\n\n1820\n01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:31,500\nSo that's one thing.\n\n1821\n01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,750\nThe second thing is an expiration date.\n\n1822\n01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:35,750\nCertificates are not good forever.\n\n1823\n01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:39,260\nIn fact, the recommendation is to\nget them only good for one year.\n\n1824\n01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:42,050\nYou wanna change your certificate\nevery year if you can.\n\n1825\n01:24:42,050 --> 01:24:45,480\nThey'll sell you two year and three year\ncertificates, they'll sell you longer.\n\n1826\n01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:48,770\nBut the best practice is\nto get one year certs.\n\n1827\n01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:53,600\nAnd so on that one year cert, if it's\nbeen more than one year, it's expired,\n\n1828\n01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:54,410\nit's no longer valid.\n\n1829\n01:24:54,410 --> 01:24:56,580\nYou don't wanna use it,right?\n\n1830\n01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:59,515\nWhat else,\nthere's also who it's issued by.\n\n1831\n01:24:59,515 --> 01:25:01,950\nRight?\nThis certificate I'm viewing right now,\n\n1832\n01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:04,180\nwell if I actually view it.\n\n1833\n01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:07,030\nIt was issued by somebody\nthat is not trusted.\n\n1834\n01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:09,650\nSee server certificate is not trusted.\n\n1835\n01:25:09,650 --> 01:25:11,980\nThat means somebody issued this cert.\n\n1836\n01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:14,370\nAnd then if I look,\nissued by VMWare Installer.\n\n1837\n01:25:14,370 --> 01:25:16,435\nThis was just a self-signed certificate.\n\n1838\n01:25:16,435 --> 01:25:18,035\nIf you get the it made.\n\n1839\n01:25:18,035 --> 01:25:19,415\nSo of course I'm not going to trust it.\n\n1840\n01:25:19,415 --> 01:25:22,305\nAnd look at that issued\nto LocalHost.localDomain.\n\n1841\n01:25:22,305 --> 01:25:23,840\nThat's not a valid domain.\n\n1842\n01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,895\n>> Right.\n>> So\n\n1843\n01:25:24,895 --> 01:25:29,485\nthese are red flags get kicked up to\nwarn me not to use the certificate.\n\n1844\n01:25:29,485 --> 01:25:30,195\nAll right?\n\n1845\n01:25:30,195 --> 01:25:31,885\nDoesn't mean I can't use the certificate.\n\n1846\n01:25:31,885 --> 01:25:36,130\nIf I hit Proceed Anyway,\nI'll get access to that server right.\n\n1847\n01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:39,750\nI can still do encryption and\ndecryption with that certificate right,\n\n1848\n01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:40,670\njust the plan.\n\n1849\n01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:43,070\nIt's not like the certificate is broken.\n\n1850\n01:25:43,070 --> 01:25:47,840\nIt's just it could be a fake, it could\nbe a fake issued by somebody else and\n\n1851\n01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,650\nif somebody gives me a fake search\nit could be a privacy key and\n\n1852\n01:25:51,650 --> 01:25:55,530\nthat means even while encrypting my data,\nthere might be somebody out there\n\n1853\n01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:58,880\ndecrypting it, as I transmit it,\nmy data is not safe.\n\n1854\n01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,060\nThat's our big problem.\n\n1855\n01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:02,195\n>> Exactly.\n\n1856\n01:26:02,195 --> 01:26:03,170\n>> Right,this one, I know it's safe,\n\n1857\n01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:04,790\nbecause this is a server\nI set up yesterday.\n\n1858\n01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:08,030\nWe're doing VMware training next week,\nso I needed a bunch of servers,\n\n1859\n01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:08,600\nand this is one of them.\n\n1860\n01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,450\nThat's why,\nI knew I had that sitting around.\n\n1861\n01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:14,140\nBut when you're out on the internet,\nyou should never see that,right?\n\n1862\n01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:17,670\nWhen you go to a site like ITproTV, and\n\n1863\n01:26:17,670 --> 01:26:23,090\nyou go to a secure page on there,\nlike account settings here,\n\n1864\n01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:26,080\nand it flips over SSL, you shouldn't\nget a red line and a warning,\n\n1865\n01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,690\nyou should get a green box letting\nyou know the certificate is verified.\n\n1866\n01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:31,320\nIdentity verified.\n\n1867\n01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:35,260\nRight, that's it telling me it\npassed all its little checks.\n\n1868\n01:26:35,260 --> 01:26:38,150\n>> And most of the time if you do get\nthat warning it'll give you the option,\n\n1869\n01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:41,210\nas you said,\nyou could continue to that page.\n\n1870\n01:26:41,210 --> 01:26:45,200\nIf you're gonna be putting your credit\ncard number in there, yeah, don't do that.\n\n1871\n01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,460\n>> Yap.\n>> Unless you truly know the people.\n\n1872\n01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:48,930\nLike I know here in the US\na lot of the military posts for\n\n1873\n01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:51,310\na while were having trouble\nwith their exchange.\n\n1874\n01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:54,320\nThey had issued self-signed\ncertificates to their mailbox servers.\n\n1875\n01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:58,080\nSo when you go to check your mail from\noutside of the base, you'd always get this\n\n1876\n01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,540\nwarning, hey, this certificate\ncannot be trusted to a trusted root.\n\n1877\n01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:02,830\nAre you sure you want to continue?\n\n1878\n01:27:02,830 --> 01:27:03,900\nEverybody knew just to go ahead and\n\n1879\n01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:07,460\nclick yes because we knew who it\nwas issued by and we trusted them.\n\n1880\n01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:11,060\nBut, in most situations when you get that\nwarning, you really want to think about,\n\n1881\n01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:14,630\ndo I want to continue,\nbecause your computer is telling you, hey,\n\n1882\n01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:16,220\nI don't know who generated\nthis certificate.\n\n1883\n01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:20,370\nIt could have been somebody trust worthy,\nit could have been somebody malicious.\n\n1884\n01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:22,150\n>> Yeah.\n>> And you're basically putting your\n\n1885\n01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:24,140\nfaith into it and they'll steal your data.\n\n1886\n01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:26,760\n>> Yeah, heck, I could have issued\na certificate with the same domain\n\n1887\n01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:27,910\nname, right?\n\n1888\n01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:30,880\nAnd done DNS cache poisoning\n\n1889\n01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,855\nto cause your home computer to\nredirect to my mail server.\n\n1890\n01:27:33,855 --> 01:27:35,170\n>> Exactly.\n>> It's that fake cert, and\n\n1891\n01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:36,690\nyou're so\nin the habit of just saying oh yeah,\n\n1892\n01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:40,040\nI'll hit okay, that you don't notice\nyou're not even on the right server,\n\n1893\n01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,220\nyou punch in user name and\npassword, and now I've got them.\n\n1894\n01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:43,167\nThat's how those attacks work.\n\n1895\n01:27:43,167 --> 01:27:44,834\nSo we've got to be careful with it.\n\n1896\n01:27:44,834 --> 01:27:49,458\nNow, you mentioned a trusted route, right?\n\n1897\n01:27:49,458 --> 01:27:51,917\nWho do we trust,\nwho do we trust to issue out certificates?\n\n1898\n01:27:51,917 --> 01:27:55,297\nWell there's a handful of companies that\nare out there, that specialize in this,\n\n1899\n01:27:55,297 --> 01:27:56,440\nthey sell certificates.\n\n1900\n01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:59,230\n>> Yeah, we've got public CAs and we've\ngot private CAs, and Don's getting ready\n\n1901\n01:27:59,230 --> 01:28:01,549\nto talk about these public CAs that\nexist out there on the internet.\n\n1902\n01:28:01,549 --> 01:28:02,159\n>> Yeah.\n\n1903\n01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:05,436\nAnd the public ones, the way they work is,\nif Mike wants a certificate,\n\n1904\n01:28:05,436 --> 01:28:06,690\nhe can come to me to buy one.\n\n1905\n01:28:06,690 --> 01:28:08,420\nLet's say I'm the public CA.\n\n1906\n01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:09,850\nBut, I don't just give him a cert.\n\n1907\n01:28:09,850 --> 01:28:11,100\nI say\n>> My name's Bill Gates,\n\n1908\n01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:12,100\ncan I have a certificate please?\n\n1909\n01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:13,190\n>> Exactly.\n\n1910\n01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:14,690\nSo, I have to validate his identity.\n\n1911\n01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:18,090\nSo, I say, Mike, can you send me\na photocopy of your drivers license and\n\n1912\n01:28:18,090 --> 01:28:18,820\nI need a phone number.\n\n1913\n01:28:18,820 --> 01:28:22,610\nI'm gonna call you and verify,\nthey do identity verification, right,\n\n1914\n01:28:22,610 --> 01:28:24,940\nthat's what you're really paying for\nwhen you buy those certificates.\n\n1915\n01:28:24,940 --> 01:28:27,890\nThe certificate itself doesn't\ncost them anything to issue, but\n\n1916\n01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:30,570\nthe identity verification,\nthat's what you're paying for.\n\n1917\n01:28:30,570 --> 01:28:31,880\nAnd so they'll make you do things.\n\n1918\n01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,640\nLike when we bought\nthe ITPROTV certificate,\n\n1919\n01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:37,772\nwe had to verify that we own that\ndomain by, they kicked an e-mail out,\n\n1920\n01:28:37,772 --> 01:28:41,360\nthe e-mail it was an administrator\non the DNS record.\n\n1921\n01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,210\nThose are the ways they\nvalidate your identity,\n\n1922\n01:28:43,210 --> 01:28:48,050\nand then you get a certificate,\nnow which of those companies do you trust?\n\n1923\n01:28:48,050 --> 01:28:50,160\nWell most people don't pick.\n\n1924\n01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:53,400\nMost people they just go with whatever\nthe operating system vendors have\n\n1925\n01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,970\nset by default.\n\n1926\n01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:57,000\nLike I'm running Windows right here.\n\n1927\n01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:57,990\n>> Good ol' IE there.\n\n1928\n01:28:57,990 --> 01:29:03,020\n>> And if I fire up my, let me get my\ncertificate screen up here real quick.\n\n1929\n01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:06,270\nI'm just gonna bring this up,\nI'll do from my user.\n\n1930\n01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:10,349\nAnd I'm gonna show you the certificates\nthat Microsoft has chosen for us to trust.\n\n1931\n01:29:11,450 --> 01:29:14,700\nHere I've got my trusted root\ncertification authorities and\n\n1932\n01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:18,460\nthese are the companies that\nMicrosoft is telling me to trust.\n\n1933\n01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:20,550\nOkay?\nAnd you'll see here companies that\n\n1934\n01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:25,520\nyou know like, Equifax,\nGeoTrust, Microsoft, of course.\n\n1935\n01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:29,430\n>> Verisign\n>> Verisign, there's a couple of big names\n\n1936\n01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:34,360\nthat are in here and these are companies\nthat Microsoft has deemed trustworthy,\n\n1937\n01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:37,330\nand by you running their OS,\nyou deem are trustworthy.\n\n1938\n01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:40,460\n>> There's a big advantage to buying\na certificate from a public entity like\n\n1939\n01:29:40,460 --> 01:29:44,270\nthat, if I'm gonna run a public website,\nan e-commerce site or something like that.\n\n1940\n01:29:44,270 --> 01:29:48,100\nIf you come to my website and\nyou go to access your cart,\n\n1941\n01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:50,330\nI don't want you getting\na big warning that says hey,\n\n1942\n01:29:50,330 --> 01:29:53,540\nwe can't trust this certificate,\nare you sure you wanna do this?\n\n1943\n01:29:53,540 --> 01:29:56,390\nI'm gonna buy a certificate\nfrom one of these\n\n1944\n01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:59,310\npublic companies that your\ncomputer already knows to trust.\n\n1945\n01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:02,730\nThat way you can set up\nthat SSL connection and\n\n1946\n01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:05,625\nyou don't get the big warning, you get the\ngreen, and hopefully you buy my product.\n\n1947\n01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:07,930\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, yeah,\nthat's what we hope.\n\n1948\n01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:11,930\nYou don't have to trust these people\nthough, you can delete some of these guys\n\n1949\n01:30:11,930 --> 01:30:14,190\nout if there's somebody in\nthere that you don't trust.\n\n1950\n01:30:14,190 --> 01:30:18,320\nOr if you have your own server, like my\nserver over there that I wasn't trusting,\n\n1951\n01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:23,000\nI can add them in and then I will trust\ncertificates issued by that provider so\n\n1952\n01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,180\nwe control the certificate's door.\n\n1953\n01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:27,850\n>> That's what we have to do in\nhouse if we're gonna run our own CA,\n\n1954\n01:30:27,850 --> 01:30:30,920\na private CA cuz those do cost money.\n\n1955\n01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:32,420\nI've got to buy those certificates,\n\n1956\n01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:34,200\nthey're not forever,\nI've got to renew them.\n\n1957\n01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:37,840\nSo there's a recurring cost associated\nwith, and if I wanna use certificates in\n\n1958\n01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:42,470\nhouse for IPsec or for digitally\nsigning e-mails or something like that,\n\n1959\n01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:46,290\nI might not wanna purchase a certificate\nfor every single user in my company.\n\n1960\n01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:49,380\nI can run my own CA, and\nI can issue my own certificates.\n\n1961\n01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:52,250\nThey're not gonna be trusted by anyone\noutside the company, but that's okay,\n\n1962\n01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:52,880\nI don't really care.\n\n1963\n01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,200\nWe're using them in house.\n\n1964\n01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:58,720\nAnd I can use something like group policy,\nto distribute my root CA certificate\n\n1965\n01:30:58,720 --> 01:31:02,440\nto the trusted roots store on all\nmy client machines on my network.\n\n1966\n01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:03,230\n>> Yeah.\n\n1967\n01:31:03,230 --> 01:31:06,300\nSo, that whole system.\n\n1968\n01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:09,560\nIs called a public key infrastructure,\nand it can be private or public.\n\n1969\n01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:12,730\nIf you've got your own server or\nif you're using the public ones.\n\n1970\n01:31:12,730 --> 01:31:14,320\nBut they all work the same.\n\n1971\n01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:17,400\nAnd so I want to show you guys a little\ndiagram of kinda how the process\n\n1972\n01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:18,690\nworks, all right?\n\n1973\n01:31:18,690 --> 01:31:23,910\nWe start with what's called a primary CA,\nor a Root Certificate Authority.\n\n1974\n01:31:23,910 --> 01:31:25,910\nThe guys that were in that list\nI showed you a moment ago,\n\n1975\n01:31:25,910 --> 01:31:27,790\nthose were all root CA's, right?\n\n1976\n01:31:27,790 --> 01:31:29,770\nThose are the head honchos.\n\n1977\n01:31:29,770 --> 01:31:31,800\nAnd they create a central server,\n\n1978\n01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:35,090\nA route CA that's got a certificate\ndatabase attached to it.\n\n1979\n01:31:35,090 --> 01:31:37,788\nAnd then they create\nadditional subordinate CA's.\n\n1980\n01:31:37,788 --> 01:31:40,394\nAnd the subordinate CA's\nare who we actually talk to.\n\n1981\n01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:46,900\nBecause the primary, this guy right here,\nhe's got the private key for the route.\n\n1982\n01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:50,100\nAnd that is a super mega sensitive thing.\n\n1983\n01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:54,320\nAnd so what most people do,\nis they bring up that primary CA,\n\n1984\n01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:57,930\nthey create their subordinates,\nand then they shut this one down.\n\n1985\n01:31:57,930 --> 01:32:01,810\nAnd you can pretty much guarantee\nthat VeriSign, GeoTrust,\n\n1986\n01:32:01,810 --> 01:32:05,230\nthose guys, their root CA is,\nat a minimum,\n\n1987\n01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:09,130\nnot even plugged into the network, but\nmore than likely not even powered on.\n\n1988\n01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:14,090\nYou can't hack into a computer if it's\nnot even turned on and plugged in.\n\n1989\n01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:17,650\nSo that's what a lot of\nthem do with their root CA.\n\n1990\n01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:18,310\nAll right?\n\n1991\n01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:20,100\nBut their subordinates are up and\nrunning and\n\n1992\n01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:22,140\nthey're the ones that are issuing\ncertificates out on the internet.\n\n1993\n01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:24,840\nSo when we buy a cert we're actually\ngetting it from the subordinate\n\n1994\n01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,780\nin most cases, all right?\n\n1995\n01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:29,760\nTo get a certificate the way\nit works is like this.\n\n1996\n01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:36,510\nYou're on a client and you generate what's\ncalled a certificate signing request,\n\n1997\n01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:40,980\nyou're requesting that somebody\nsigns a certificate for you.\n\n1998\n01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:41,990\nNow what do I mean by sign?\n\n1999\n01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:45,100\nWell, you actually make\nthe certificate yourself.\n\n2000\n01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:50,460\nThe client is generating a private key,\nand the other information needed in,\n\n2001\n01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:54,530\nmost typically a XF509 certificate,\nso they make it.\n\n2002\n01:32:54,530 --> 01:32:58,210\nThe only problem is nobody out there\nis gonna trust this certificate.\n\n2003\n01:32:58,210 --> 01:33:00,600\nWe put it into a signing request, and\n\n2004\n01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:03,860\nwe send it to a certificate authority,\nall right?\n\n2005\n01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:09,655\nThat's the next step in this little\njourney is the certificate signing request\n\n2006\n01:33:09,655 --> 01:33:12,124\nis going to go to to a subordinate CA,\nright.\n\n2007\n01:33:12,124 --> 01:33:16,315\nOr it could go to a primary, but\nnot if the company is with their software.\n\n2008\n01:33:16,315 --> 01:33:16,905\n>> Exactly.\n>> Now,\n\n2009\n01:33:16,905 --> 01:33:21,121\nall the subordinates you see there,\nor the certificate authority does,\n\n2010\n01:33:21,121 --> 01:33:23,093\nis they look at the certificate and\n\n2011\n01:33:23,093 --> 01:33:26,835\nthey say all right, I need to\nvalidate this first ones identity.\n\n2012\n01:33:26,835 --> 01:33:29,605\nI need to go through this various\nworkflow to get it approved.\n\n2013\n01:33:29,605 --> 01:33:33,590\nAnd assuming everything's on the up and\nup, we will permit it and\n\n2014\n01:33:33,590 --> 01:33:35,760\nwe'll issue the certificate.\n\n2015\n01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:40,190\nOr we will reject it and decline\nthe certificate based on our findings.\n\n2016\n01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:44,030\nIf they issue it,\nall they do is take your certificate,\n\n2017\n01:33:44,030 --> 01:33:48,680\nyour key that you generated, and\nthey attach a digital signature to it.\n\n2018\n01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:53,380\nThey sign it, to say that they\nhave approved of that certificate.\n\n2019\n01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:56,100\nIt's really the same certificate.\n\n2020\n01:33:56,100 --> 01:34:00,350\nThe CSR and the signed certificate are the\nsame, the only difference is the signed\n\n2021\n01:34:00,350 --> 01:34:05,390\ncertificate signed by the CA\nsaying they approved it.\n\n2022\n01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:08,510\nAnd then,\nthat's returned back to our client, and\n\n2023\n01:34:08,510 --> 01:34:12,020\nnow our client has a certificate,\nthat they can use.\n\n2024\n01:34:12,020 --> 01:34:17,290\nThat they can go out on the internet and\nuse for whatever purposes it is they need.\n\n2025\n01:34:17,290 --> 01:34:20,390\nAnd that client might be you as\na person or it might be a company,\n\n2026\n01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:21,560\nit could be any number of things.\n\n2027\n01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:23,430\n>> It could be a service,\nit could be a computer account.\n\n2028\n01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:25,760\nAnd it's all about trust\nwhen it comes down to it.\n\n2029\n01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:30,020\nNow that I've got that certificate it's\nbeen signed by that subordinate CA.\n\n2030\n01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:34,080\nThe reason I can use it and\npresent to identify myself or\n\n2031\n01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:37,280\nuse it to digitally sign e-mails or\nwhatever the case may be,\n\n2032\n01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:40,680\nis because everybody knows to\ntrust that subordinate CA.\n\n2033\n01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:45,270\nWhat we're doing is we're saying, I trust\nthe fact that that subordinate CA did\n\n2034\n01:34:45,270 --> 01:34:49,490\nits job, and verified the identity before\nit ever put that signature on there.\n\n2035\n01:34:49,490 --> 01:34:51,160\nYeah.\nWhen we get that certificate from Bank of\n\n2036\n01:34:51,160 --> 01:34:53,660\nAmerica, it's signed by Verisign.\n\n2037\n01:34:53,660 --> 01:34:58,480\nI trust that Verisign did their job,\nand that they verified the identity of\n\n2038\n01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:01,040\nthe requester before they would\never issue that certificate.\n\n2039\n01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:03,640\nThey're going to because it's\ntheir name on the line, right?\n\n2040\n01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:04,910\nIt's their business on the line.\n\n2041\n01:35:04,910 --> 01:35:09,230\nIf they're issuing certificates to\nme in the name of Bank of America,\n\n2042\n01:35:09,230 --> 01:35:11,930\nnobody's gonna trust them and\nthey're gonna be out of business.\n\n2043\n01:35:11,930 --> 01:35:14,200\n>> Yeah.\nAnd every certificate has what's called\n\n2044\n01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:19,180\na certificate chain attached to it and\nlet me just bring up, I'll bring up.\n\n2045\n01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:20,670\nOpen up our certificate here.\n\n2046\n01:35:20,670 --> 01:35:23,180\nThis is the IT Pro TV certificate.\n\n2047\n01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:25,300\nYou can see it's good until May of 2015.\n\n2048\n01:35:25,300 --> 01:35:29,287\nIt's a one year certificate,\nsometime between now and May of next year,\n\n2049\n01:35:29,287 --> 01:35:32,583\nwe'll have to replace the certificate or\nrenew it, right?\n\n2050\n01:35:32,583 --> 01:35:37,072\nIf somebody gets the certificates, like I\nsee it right now, I can look at this and\n\n2051\n01:35:37,072 --> 01:35:41,200\nsay, all right it's issued to itpro.tv and\nI'm browsed to itpro.tv.\n\n2052\n01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,126\nAll right, so I've got that.\n\n2053\n01:35:42,126 --> 01:35:42,917\n>> Name matches, that's good.\n\n2054\n01:35:42,917 --> 01:35:43,958\n>> And it's valid from these days.\n\n2055\n01:35:43,958 --> 01:35:46,168\nI can verify that stuff myself, right?\n\n2056\n01:35:46,168 --> 01:35:49,458\nAnd then I can see Issued by GeoTrust.\n\n2057\n01:35:49,458 --> 01:35:51,240\nAll right, well, do I trust them?\n\n2058\n01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:52,412\nIs that a root CA?\n\n2059\n01:35:52,412 --> 01:35:53,368\n>> Who the heck is GeoTrust, yeah.\n>> Who are they?\n\n2060\n01:35:53,368 --> 01:35:57,722\nYeah, now, I saw GeoTrust in my list of\ntrusted root CAs so I know its there.\n\n2061\n01:35:57,722 --> 01:36:01,144\nBut oftentimes you'll see names of\ncompanies you've never heard of here.\n\n2062\n01:36:01,144 --> 01:36:05,626\nAnd if you go to the certification path,\nyou might see ITProTV,\n\n2063\n01:36:05,626 --> 01:36:10,274\nsomebody you've never heard of,\nand then their cert was issued by\n\n2064\n01:36:10,274 --> 01:36:14,680\nsomebody you have heard of,\nGeoTrust, Verisign, whoever.\n\n2065\n01:36:15,710 --> 01:36:18,160\nSo that chain is equally important.\n\n2066\n01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:21,650\nThat chain is also what we can use\nto validate that the certificate is\n\n2067\n01:36:21,650 --> 01:36:22,860\ntruly valid.\n\n2068\n01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:26,000\nLooking at the details here,\nlooks like the certificate is good,\n\n2069\n01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,450\nlooks like everything is fine.\n\n2070\n01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:28,290\nRight?\n\n2071\n01:36:28,290 --> 01:36:30,970\nBut what if this certificate\nhad been compromised?\n\n2072\n01:36:30,970 --> 01:36:32,410\nWhat if the private key had been broken?\n\n2073\n01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:38,080\nWell I could call up GeoTrust and I could\nsay hey, I'm Don, I'm at IT Pro TV,\n\n2074\n01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:40,070\nour certificate got compromised.\n\n2075\n01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:44,090\nWe need to revoke that certificate\nright now and we'll issue a new one and\n\n2076\n01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:45,000\nreplace it.\n\n2077\n01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:45,740\nOkay?\n\n2078\n01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:49,260\nWell if somebody else is out on Internet\nthey browse and they see this certificate,\n\n2079\n01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:51,590\nthey don't know whether its\nbeen compromised or not.\n\n2080\n01:36:51,590 --> 01:36:53,505\nThere's no value here that\nsays compromised, yes.\n\n2081\n01:36:53,505 --> 01:36:55,830\n[LAUGH].\nSo we don't have that.\n\n2082\n01:36:55,830 --> 01:36:59,558\nSo the other role of a certificate\nauthority, other than issuing\n\n2083\n01:36:59,558 --> 01:37:04,390\ncertificates, is to keep track of\nwhich ones have been revoked, right?\n\n2084\n01:37:04,390 --> 01:37:08,730\nAnd so that's what I've put here\nin my diagram, is this CRL.\n\n2085\n01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:13,410\nThat's the Certificate Revocation List.\n\n2086\n01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:18,630\nAny time a cert gets revoked,\nthe CA will make an entry in the CRL.\n\n2087\n01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:23,660\nAnd when we as a client browse to\na website and see that certificate,\n\n2088\n01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:28,290\nwe can reach out to the CA and check\ntheir list and say, is this on the list?\n\n2089\n01:37:28,290 --> 01:37:31,350\nAnd if it is, it's been revoked,\nand we shouldn't use it.\n\n2090\n01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:33,740\nAnd if it's not on the list,\nthen it's still good.\n\n2091\n01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:34,788\nWe can use it, off we go.\n\n2092\n01:37:34,788 --> 01:37:37,670\n>> Yeah, that's, now there's impact,\nwe pull that certificate back up,\n\n2093\n01:37:37,670 --> 01:37:39,480\nwe might be able to see it.\n\n2094\n01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:43,500\nThere's something called\nthe CRL Distribution Point or the CDP.\n\n2095\n01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:47,165\nIf we go to the Details tab,\nsee if we can see it in there.\n\n2096\n01:37:47,165 --> 01:37:49,940\nYeah, CRL Distribution Point.\n\n2097\n01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:51,180\nSo that's the URL.\n\n2098\n01:37:51,180 --> 01:37:54,780\nIn the certificate that that server\nis presenting to your computer,\n\n2099\n01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:57,200\nis the location of that revocation list.\n\n2100\n01:37:57,200 --> 01:38:00,014\nBecause Global Trust,\nor GeoTrust, Verisign,\n\n2101\n01:38:00,014 --> 01:38:03,904\nThawte, they all maintain their\nown certificate revocation list.\n\n2102\n01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:08,024\nAnd my computer needs to be able to\nfind that list to make sure that that\n\n2103\n01:38:08,024 --> 01:38:10,435\ncertificate has not been revoked.\n\n2104\n01:38:10,435 --> 01:38:13,070\nCuz if they revoke the certificate,\nthey can't pull it back.\n\n2105\n01:38:13,070 --> 01:38:16,520\nI might have backed it up, I might have\nexported it, they can't yank it back.\n\n2106\n01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:20,410\nSo they just have to maintain a list,\nand then every time our computer gets\n\n2107\n01:38:20,410 --> 01:38:24,440\npresented a certificate, we look in\nthe details of the certificate and we find\n\n2108\n01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:28,370\nwhere they've published or made available\nthat certificate revocation list.\n\n2109\n01:38:28,370 --> 01:38:32,090\nAnd then I have to parse that entire\nlist to see if that certificate\n\n2110\n01:38:32,090 --> 01:38:32,790\nis on that list.\n\n2111\n01:38:32,790 --> 01:38:36,310\nIf it's on the list, I don't trust it,\nI get the big red warning.\n\n2112\n01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:38,320\nIf it's not on the list,\nwe assume it's valid.\n\n2113\n01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:38,870\n>> Yeah.\n\n2114\n01:38:38,870 --> 01:38:41,150\nAnd here's, I'm just paging\nthrough their revocation list.\n\n2115\n01:38:41,150 --> 01:38:43,290\nYou can see it's just\na whole list of certificates.\n\n2116\n01:38:43,290 --> 01:38:46,590\nIt does list them by serial number, so\nit doesn't have the domain name and\n\n2117\n01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:47,930\nissue date and all that stuff.\n\n2118\n01:38:47,930 --> 01:38:49,880\nIt just has the serial number and\nthe revocation date.\n\n2119\n01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:51,990\nSo I don't actually know\nwhat these certificates are.\n\n2120\n01:38:51,990 --> 01:38:55,570\nBut I can see here where\nGeoTrust has revoked,\n\n2121\n01:38:55,570 --> 01:38:58,510\nthere's probably thousands\nof certificates in here.\n\n2122\n01:38:58,510 --> 01:39:01,090\nAnd some of these revocations\ndate back a little bit.\n\n2123\n01:39:01,090 --> 01:39:04,720\nBut when a certificate expires\nit doesn't have to go in here,\n\n2124\n01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:08,400\nso all of these will be certificates\nthat are still considered valid.\n\n2125\n01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:12,620\nSo everything I see should have\nlike 2014 as the revocation date.\n\n2126\n01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:16,560\nI probably don't see anything\nprior to that, yeah.\n\n2127\n01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:19,568\nCuz certificates naturally\nexpire off on their own.\n\n2128\n01:39:19,568 --> 01:39:23,901\nNow, one problem with this, and Mike, you\nhinted at it, is we have to parse through\n\n2129\n01:39:23,901 --> 01:39:25,909\nthis whole list-\n>> Yeah, and that can take time.\n\n2130\n01:39:25,909 --> 01:39:27,011\n>> And it can be big.\n>> Yeah.\n\n2131\n01:39:27,011 --> 01:39:28,036\n>> And as a result,\n\n2132\n01:39:28,036 --> 01:39:33,980\nthere are some web browser vendors out\nthere that are skipping checking the CRL.\n\n2133\n01:39:33,980 --> 01:39:35,970\nFirefox is good about checking it.\n\n2134\n01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:39,170\nChrome and Internet Explorer, it's kind\nof a crap shoot whether they bother to\n\n2135\n01:39:39,170 --> 01:39:41,310\ncheck the CRL, and that's a problem.\n\n2136\n01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:41,930\n>> Absolutely.\n\n2137\n01:39:41,930 --> 01:39:44,185\n>> So,\nthey've been working to improve that and\n\n2138\n01:39:44,185 --> 01:39:46,490\nCompTIA's recognized\nthat on the objectives.\n\n2139\n01:39:46,490 --> 01:39:52,530\nThey also call out the OCSP,\nwhich is a new solution that we've\n\n2140\n01:39:52,530 --> 01:39:57,410\ngot that allows us to basically query\nwhether a certificate has been revoked,\n\n2141\n01:39:57,410 --> 01:40:00,820\nwithout having to parse through\na giant list and all of that.\n\n2142\n01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:03,221\nSo, Mike you're better at this-\n>> Online Certificate Status\n\n2143\n01:40:03,221 --> 01:40:03,993\nProtocol, I think?\n\n2144\n01:40:03,993 --> 01:40:05,348\n>> Thank you, I knew you'd know it.\n\n2145\n01:40:05,348 --> 01:40:06,334\n[LAUGH]\n>> The OCSP.\n\n2146\n01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:09,782\nAnd basically what it is,\nis instead of your client reaching out and\n\n2147\n01:40:09,782 --> 01:40:13,470\ngetting that revocation list and\ndoing all the work himself.\n\n2148\n01:40:13,470 --> 01:40:17,570\nIn the certificate, they're gonna say,\nhey, here's my CRL Distribution Point, but\n\n2149\n01:40:17,570 --> 01:40:19,280\nwe're also running an OCSP.\n\n2150\n01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:23,380\nAnd you can send the query to there, and\nthe OCSP will parse the list for you and\n\n2151\n01:40:23,380 --> 01:40:26,010\nthen just return to the client\na simple yes or no.\n\n2152\n01:40:26,010 --> 01:40:29,100\nYes, the certificate's valid or\nno, the certificate's not.\n\n2153\n01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:32,345\nAnd the OCSP can cache the information so\nit can speed up that whole\n\n2154\n01:40:32,345 --> 01:40:36,740\nrevocation-checking process, and\nreally reduce the workload on the client.\n\n2155\n01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:37,752\n>> Yeah.\n>> Make it a little quicker.\n\n2156\n01:40:37,752 --> 01:40:41,760\n>> So, I haven't seen it where they\nweren't running both an OCSP and\n\n2157\n01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:46,290\na CRL cuz older systems don't know\nabout OCSP, they're not gonna use it.\n\n2158\n01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:49,530\nSo for backwards compatibility,\nthey normally run both, right?\n\n2159\n01:40:49,530 --> 01:40:51,196\n>> And you still gotta maintain that list,\n\n2160\n01:40:51,196 --> 01:40:54,285\ncuz the OCSP is gonna be checking\nthe certificate revocation list.\n\n2161\n01:40:54,285 --> 01:40:56,090\nHe's just doing it on behalf of you.\n\n2162\n01:40:56,090 --> 01:40:56,790\n>> Yeah.\n\n2163\n01:40:56,790 --> 01:41:01,915\nAnd in my diagram, I drew a primary CA,\nor a root CA, and one subordinate.\n\n2164\n01:41:01,915 --> 01:41:02,550\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n2165\n01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:04,500\n>> They might have\nhundreds of subordinates.\n\n2166\n01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:06,310\nIf they're a big company they\nmight need a lot of these.\n\n2167\n01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:08,080\nSo they might have a bunch of those,\n\n2168\n01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:11,090\nwhich means they have a lot of\ndistribution points for that CRL.\n\n2169\n01:41:11,090 --> 01:41:11,840\n>> Right.\n\n2170\n01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:15,490\nOr for OCSP, so they can do that for\nperformance reasons.\n\n2171\n01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:18,120\n>> Exactly.\nAnd a single OCSP can handle multiple\n\n2172\n01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:21,340\nsubordinate CAs, so\nthey don't have to run a separate OCSP for\n\n2173\n01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:22,680\neach subordinate that they have.\n\n2174\n01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:23,980\n>> Yeah.\n\n2175\n01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:25,855\nAll right, so\nthese are kind of the nuts and\n\n2176\n01:41:25,855 --> 01:41:28,835\nbolts components of a public\nkey infrastructure.\n\n2177\n01:41:28,835 --> 01:41:32,185\nThere's more that you can do, but from\na general sense, what we need to know from\n\n2178\n01:41:32,185 --> 01:41:35,605\nthe exam, these are the key components\nthat we're gonna have inside of it.\n\n2179\n01:41:35,605 --> 01:41:40,240\nWe can also have certificate proxies and\nautomatic certificate issuers and\n\n2180\n01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:41,480\nthings like that.\n\n2181\n01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:44,070\nWith Windows you can get\nthe Active Directory involved,\n\n2182\n01:41:44,070 --> 01:41:46,270\nissuing certs,\nthere's all sorts of crazy things.\n\n2183\n01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:49,550\n>> Yeah jump over to that 2412,\ncatch some of those episodes.\n\n2184\n01:41:49,550 --> 01:41:51,924\nWe dive deep into, at least\nMicrosoft-based certificate authority.\n\n2185\n01:41:51,924 --> 01:41:53,235\n>> Oh, yeah, yeah.\n\n2186\n01:41:53,235 --> 01:41:56,963\nBut yeah, so that's all there but these\nare the primary components that we're\n\n2187\n01:41:56,963 --> 01:41:59,030\ngonna have when we deal with certificates.\n\n2188\n01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:04,210\nNow they do call a few other things out,\nlike a recovery agent, all right?\n\n2189\n01:42:04,210 --> 01:42:07,636\nA recovery agent just says all right,\nyou've got a private key and\n\n2190\n01:42:07,636 --> 01:42:12,480\nyou can use that to decrypt data that\nyou've encrypted with your public key.\n\n2191\n01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,750\nWhat happens if you lose\nyour private key though?\n\n2192\n01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:15,490\n>> Right.\n\n2193\n01:42:15,490 --> 01:42:17,850\n>> Can you decrypt data that's\nbeen encrypted to your public key?\n\n2194\n01:42:17,850 --> 01:42:18,700\n>> You're toast.\n\n2195\n01:42:18,700 --> 01:42:20,480\n>> No, you're out of luck, right?\n\n2196\n01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:24,320\nSo some systems will provide\na recovery agent, all right?\n\n2197\n01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:29,010\nNot a way to restore a deleted key,\nbut instead,\n\n2198\n01:42:29,010 --> 01:42:33,320\nan alternate key that can also\nbe used to decrypt that data.\n\n2199\n01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:37,460\nSo much like your private key,\nthis is like a second private key,\n\n2200\n01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:39,670\na second key that works in the lock.\n\n2201\n01:42:39,670 --> 01:42:41,433\n>> It kind of depends on,\nMicrosoft has introduced,\n\n2202\n01:42:41,433 --> 01:42:44,060\nyou have the data recovery agent which\nI think is what you're referring to.\n\n2203\n01:42:44,060 --> 01:42:50,000\nSo in a Windows world if you encrypt data,\nit's protected with your public key,\n\n2204\n01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,590\nwhich means your private key\ncan then decrypt the data.\n\n2205\n01:42:52,590 --> 01:42:57,210\nThey also take the data recovery agent's\npublic key, encrypt the file encryption\n\n2206\n01:42:57,210 --> 01:43:01,130\nkey, and then he can use his private\nkey to decrypt that data as well.\n\n2207\n01:43:01,130 --> 01:43:03,440\nWith 2012 and\nCertificate Authority in Microsoft,\n\n2208\n01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:06,470\nwe can also create what's\ncalled a key recovery agent.\n\n2209\n01:43:06,470 --> 01:43:10,433\nWhere we will archive, when I issue you a\nkey, I'm gonna take a copy of that key and\n\n2210\n01:43:10,433 --> 01:43:14,473\nput it aside, and save it in that database\nthat he has drawn up there on his picture.\n\n2211\n01:43:14,473 --> 01:43:17,148\nAnd then the key recovery agent,\nif I lose my key,\n\n2212\n01:43:17,148 --> 01:43:20,845\nwhereas the data recovery agent has\nto go and decrypt all my data, and\n\n2213\n01:43:20,845 --> 01:43:23,841\nI might miss a few documents,\nit's a tedious process,\n\n2214\n01:43:23,841 --> 01:43:28,550\nthe key recovery agent can actually go get\na copy of my key and just put it back.\n\n2215\n01:43:28,550 --> 01:43:30,350\nAnd then I just keep on\ngoing like nothing is wrong.\n\n2216\n01:43:30,350 --> 01:43:30,850\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's very handy.\n\n2217\n01:43:30,850 --> 01:43:32,508\n>> And that key recovery agent,\n\n2218\n01:43:32,508 --> 01:43:36,753\nit's really kind of blending or blurring\nthe lines between a recovery agent\n\n2219\n01:43:36,753 --> 01:43:39,441\nand key escrow.\nCuz in effect you're maintaining that\n\n2220\n01:43:39,441 --> 01:43:42,221\nextra copy of the key to be\nable to have access to it, so-\n\n2221\n01:43:42,221 --> 01:43:43,831\n>> Usually that recovery agent's in-house,\n\n2222\n01:43:43,831 --> 01:43:46,560\nkey escrow might be\na third party typically.\n\n2223\n01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:47,830\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n2224\n01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:48,895\nOr you run it yourself, right?\n\n2225\n01:43:48,895 --> 01:43:50,108\n>> Yeah.\n>> I mentioned earlier,\n\n2226\n01:43:50,108 --> 01:43:51,750\nwhat key escrow service\nare you going to trust?\n\n2227\n01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:52,542\nAnd I said none of them?\n\n2228\n01:43:52,542 --> 01:43:53,767\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well you could be your\n\n2229\n01:43:53,767 --> 01:43:57,000\nown key escrow service, you could have\nyour own service set up for that, so.\n\n2230\n01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,073\n>> Set up so you need like\nthree different administrators,\n\n2231\n01:44:00,073 --> 01:44:01,550\nto be able to recover a key?\n\n2232\n01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:05,510\n>> Yeah, possibilities are endless\ndepending on the level of security it is\n\n2233\n01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:07,460\nyou're trying to achieve, all right.\n\n2234\n01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:10,100\nJust keep in mind when it\ncomes to trust models,\n\n2235\n01:44:10,100 --> 01:44:12,175\nthere's the public CAs that are out there.\n\n2236\n01:44:12,175 --> 01:44:14,720\nThat your customers\nare already gonna trust.\n\n2237\n01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:16,960\nAnd if you by search them,\nyou'll be covered.\n\n2238\n01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:20,350\nOr, there's the private model,\nwhere you build up your own servers, and\n\n2239\n01:44:20,350 --> 01:44:23,830\nnone of your customers are going to\ntrust that, but your employees may.\n\n2240\n01:44:23,830 --> 01:44:24,900\n>> Right.\n>> You can set up where you\n\n2241\n01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:26,270\npush that certificate out.\n\n2242\n01:44:26,270 --> 01:44:28,910\nYou make a choice,\nwhen you decided to push certificates.\n\n2243\n01:44:28,910 --> 01:44:32,230\nWe could have brought up IT Pro TV,\nthe website.\n\n2244\n01:44:32,230 --> 01:44:35,140\nUsing our own issued certificates\nif we wanted to, right?\n\n2245\n01:44:35,140 --> 01:44:38,650\nAnd when you signed up for service, we\ncould have said, by the way we use our own\n\n2246\n01:44:38,650 --> 01:44:43,130\ncert, so you need to install this root\ncertificate in your trusted CAs folder.\n\n2247\n01:44:43,130 --> 01:44:46,872\n>> And that's when you say, no.\n\n2248\n01:44:46,872 --> 01:44:49,010\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It would work.\n\n2249\n01:44:49,010 --> 01:44:49,640\n>> It would.\n\n2250\n01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:50,910\nBut I can guarantee you,\n\n2251\n01:44:50,910 --> 01:44:54,230\nwe would not have even the fraction\nof the subscribers we do today.\n\n2252\n01:44:54,230 --> 01:44:56,450\nBecause that's a lot of\ntrust to put in a company.\n\n2253\n01:44:56,450 --> 01:44:57,320\n>> It is.\n>> Just say what,\n\n2254\n01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:59,420\nI will trust whatever certs you issue,\nsure.\n\n2255\n01:44:59,420 --> 01:45:01,420\n>> Exactly.\nBecause once you trust the route CA\n\n2256\n01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:04,590\ncertificate, that means you trust\nthe entire public infrastructure.\n\n2257\n01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:07,470\nEvery certificate that every one\nof those subordinates is issuing,\n\n2258\n01:45:07,470 --> 01:45:10,070\nyour computer is going to say,\nyeah, I know them, I trust it.\n\n2259\n01:45:10,070 --> 01:45:11,380\nYeah.\n>> And they are gonna go with it.\n\n2260\n01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:12,990\nThat's a lot of trust.\n\n2261\n01:45:12,990 --> 01:45:16,600\n>> So if

great.\n\n2263\n01:45:20,740 --> 01:45:21,710\nYou can issue you're own search.\n\n2264\n01:45:21,710 --> 01:45:23,360\nThey're perfect for internal use.\n\n2265\n01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:26,350\nFor

right?\n\n2275\n01:45:46,610 --> 01:45:50,750\nI mean, if I'm using, I can do my\nown internal CA for internal stuff.\n\n2276\n01:45:50,750 --> 01:45:55,090\nAnd then just the one or two public CAs,\nfor my couple of public facing resources.\n\n2277\n01:45:55,090 --> 01:45:57,160\nSo, you don't have to do one or the other.\n\n2278\n01:45:58,180 --> 01:46:00,410\nThat you can set up like\na hybrid hierarchy there.\n\n2279\n01:46:00,410 --> 01:46:00,970\n>> Yeah.\n\n2280\n01:46:00,970 --> 01:46:03,100\nAnd I do that all the time with SSH.\n\n2281\n01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:07,130\nSo with SSH, I'll almost always\nuse self signed certificates,\n\n2282\n01:46:07,130 --> 01:46:09,210\nbecause who else is gonna see it?\n\n2283\n01:46:09,210 --> 01:46:10,820\n>> Right.\n>> It's just network admins and\n\n2284\n01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:11,490\nyou can write down.\n\n2285\n01:46:11,490 --> 01:46:13,820\nThat thumbprint of the certificate,\n\n2286\n01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:17,850\nand then when anybody connects that\nshould be connecting, they compare with\n\n2287\n01:46:17,850 --> 01:46:20,640\nwith the documented thumbprint to\nknow that it's the actual server.\n\n2288\n01:46:20,640 --> 01:46:22,160\nThen it gives you the same\nlevel of security, but\n\n2289\n01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:23,780\nyou don't have to go and\nbuy a bunch of servers.\n\n2290\n01:46:23,780 --> 01:46:25,290\nSo, pros and cons.\n\n2291\n01:46:27,090 --> 01:46:30,170\nBut yeah, that is in a nutshell\nthe public key infrastructure.\n\n2292\n01:46:30,170 --> 01:46:34,986\n[CROSSTALK] Like Mike said, if you want\nto see it in action, in the 70/412 show.\n\n2293\n01:46:34,986 --> 01:46:38,668\nI know for a fact we actually setup\nthe full Microsoft certificate services\n\n2294\n01:46:38,668 --> 01:46:39,198\nin there.\n\n2295\n01:46:39,198 --> 01:46:43,790\nIn the Linux Plus show,\nwe don't set up a CA.\n\n2296\n01:46:43,790 --> 01:46:47,260\nI do show like PGP,\npretty good privacy, to use public and\n\n2297\n01:46:47,260 --> 01:46:49,990\nprivate keys to encrypt some data and\ndecrypt it.\n\n2298\n01:46:49,990 --> 01:46:51,880\nSo that's over in the Linux Plus show.\n\n2299\n01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:55,320\nRemember as an IT Pro TV subscriber,\nyou have access to all the shows, so.\n\n2300\n01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:56,180\n>> Check them all out.\n\n2301\n01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:57,285\n>> You can really benefit from that.\n\n2302\n01:46:57,285 --> 01:46:59,910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The security plus exam is vendor\n\n2303\n01:46:59,910 --> 01:47:00,960\nneutral.\n\n2304\n01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:03,650\nBut, they do expect you to have at\nleast some practical experience with\n\n2305\n01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:04,200\na lot of this stuff.\n\n2306\n01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:05,020\n>> Right.\n>> So, it is a good idea to\n\n2307\n01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:06,710\njump over to the other shows and\ncheck some of that out.\n\n2308\n01:47:07,978 --> 01:47:11,430\nSo, all right well Mike,\nI think that wraps up PKI, and\n\n2309\n01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:15,450\nwith that, it wraps up the final\nobjective of security plus.\n\n2310\n01:47:15,450 --> 01:47:16,210\n>> That's why 0401.\n\n2311\n01:47:16,210 --> 01:47:17,080\nI like it.\n\n2312\n01:47:17,080 --> 01:47:19,650\n>> You think anything else we\nneed to throw in right here?\n\n2313\n01:47:19,650 --> 01:47:21,850\n>> No, I think we got it all covered.\n\n2314\n01:47:21,850 --> 01:47:22,850\nOkay.\n\n2315\n01:47:22,850 --> 01:47:24,760\nWell, let me

ITPro.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.160\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode we\n\n4\n00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.990\nare taking a look at the security plus\ncontent we've been working so hard on.\n\n5\n00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.730\nJoining us in the studio today to lend\nhis expertise on that very topic.\n\n6\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.900\nHere's our god friend, Mr. Wes Bryan.\n\n7\n00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.000\nWes, welcome back to the show, glad to\nhave you today and how are you doing.\n\n8\n00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.710\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n9\n00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.350\nAnd as always Dan it's always\ngood to be here with ITProTV.\n\n10\n00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.355\nAnd that's right,\nwe've got a few topics that we want\n\n11\n00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:42.915\nto add to the security plus training, so\nthat if you are taking the exam if some of\n\n12\n00:00:42.915 --> 00:00:46.345\nthese topics come up in the exam,\nwell you're going to be prepared for them.\n\n13\n00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:48.885\nOne of the first ones that we're going\nto jump right into is what is known as\n\n14\n00:00:48.885 --> 00:00:52.310\nthe cross site forgery request.\n\n15\n00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.750\nThis is one of these topics that really,\n\n16\n00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.340\nwe've talked about things like XSS,\nthat's the cross side scripting.\n\n17\n00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.880\nWell cross side scripting really leads\nus into the cross side request forgery.\n\n18\n00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.030\nSo, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at that.\n\n19\n00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.520\nI've actually got a little diagram\ndrawn up here on my machine.\n\n20\n00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.000\nNow, with a request forgery, cross site\nmeans that what's going to happen is\n\n21\n00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.490\nan attacker is going to,\nin a cross site scripting attack, right?\n\n22\n00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.180\nThe attacker embeds the script\nin the html of that website, and\n\n23\n00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.540\nthen when the attacker, or\nwhen the cictim, connects to the website,\n\n24\n00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.010\nthey don't even see the HTML\nscript that's there because it's,\n\n25\n00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.470\nall they see is how the web page\nis being rendered in the browser.\n\n26\n00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.750\nWell, kind of along the same principle.\n\n27\n00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.770\nWhere it differs just a little bit does\nrequire a little bit of profiling by our\n\n28\n00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.650\nattacker here.\n\n29\n00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.200\nOur attacker has to look at\nthe HTML information and a request,\n\n30\n00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.250\na legitimate request.\n\n31\n00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.530\nAnd then what he tries to do, he or\nshe tries to mimic that request.\n\n32\n00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.410\nAnd what this really does, is it\nexploits the trust relationship between\n\n33\n00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.290\nan authenticated user, which is actually\ngoing to be the victim in this case, and\n\n34\n00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.210\na website where the website\nit trusts that user,\n\n35\n00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.230\nit's a user that should be logged in.\n\n36\n00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.234\nNow once the user has that trust\nrelationship, what happens is the mimicked\n\n37\n00:02:10.234 --> 00:02:15.670\nrequest is basically sent back against\nthe victim through the website.\n\n38\n00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.490\nWhat can happen here?\n\n39\n00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.950\nWell, a lot of things can happen,\nbut I'll give you an example.\n\n40\n00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.660\nFor instance, it might be a request for\nthe email, right?\n\n41\n00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.510\nI'm going to this website,\nI'm requesting my email.\n\n42\n00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.370\nThat's a legitimate request,\nwe do that all the time.\n\n43\n00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.200\nIf you're out there and you're connecting\nto your cloud-based services right,\n\n44\n00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.157\nyour cloud-based email.\n\n45\n00:02:30.157 --> 00:02:32.680\nYou I want to see what's\ninside of your inbox.\n\n46\n00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.600\nWell, in between the html\ncommunications what\n\n47\n00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.550\nyou're going to end up seeing\nis that's a legitimate request.\n\n48\n00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.360\nGive me that information.\n\n49\n00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.740\nWell, the attacker can forge\na request that looks like it's the,\n\n50\n00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.980\nin this case, the victim,\nthe authenticated user.\n\n51\n00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.470\nThen they can turn around and have all\nthat information delivered back to them.\n\n52\n00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.150\nSo one of the things that you want to make\nsure that you're doing on your websites,\n\n53\n00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.830\njust like protecting from\na cross-site scripting,\n\n54\n00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.490\nis just to make sure that you have\ninput check validation going on.\n\n55\n00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.290\nAny field that comes up, make sure that\nit's only the characters you expect.\n\n56\n00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.410\nSo that input validation, or\nat least checking it is going to be one\n\n57\n00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.770\nof the ways that you can\nhelp mitigate this too.\n\n58\n00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.820\nThe other thing that you'll have in\nthings like Internet Explorer and Chrome,\n\n59\n00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.890\nthey do have built in features, right?\n\n60\n00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.820\nCross site scripting filters that\ncan try to neutralized this attack\n\n61\n00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.590\nbefore it happens, but it really goes into\nthe development process of the website in\n\n62\n00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.910\nmaking sure that any information\nthat's sent to the website is only\n\n63\n00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.590\nthe information that for one,\nis legitimate, and it's what we expect.\n\n64\n00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.110\n>> So a lot of the responsibility is\nweighed heavily on the developers on this.\n\n65\n00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.960\nSo you do the best you\ncan with what you have.\n\n66\n00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.660\nBrowsers, you implement all the security\nyou can to make sure that these\n\n67\n00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.630\nthings don't happen.\n\n68\n00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.600\nBut make sure that the website\ndevelopers know, hey,\n\n69\n00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.070\nlook out for this type of attack,\nand try to adjust accordingly.\n\n70\n00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.230\nNow that being said, Wes, we have\na couple other things we want to go over.\n\n71\n00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.670\nAnd one of those topics is the idea of,\nwe have hypervisors, right?\n\n72\n00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.790\nNowadays it's a very common thing.\n\n73\n00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.660\nWe keep our hosts.\n\n74\n00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.770\nThey're basically virtual machines\nthat are on a large pool of resources.\n\n75\n00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.030\nAnd that's becoming a very common\nform of even on premise systems.\n\n76\n00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.390\nProblem is we have to do something\nto try to keep those hosts secure.\n\n77\n00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.120\nAnd Wes, you've got a nice specific way\n\n78\n00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.150\nin which we can implement\nthat type of security, right?\n\n79\n00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.160\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n80\n00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.600\nAnd you know Dan, we've done this,\nwe do this a lot here at ITProTV, right?\n\n81\n00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.080\nWe have to get ready for you know what,\nthis episode we're bringing you now.\n\n82\n00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.850\nWe have to have a virtual machine ready,\nand a lot of times, or sometimes,\n\n83\n00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.450\nit's going to be security-centric.\n\n84\n00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.730\nSo for instance, there's one of\nthe episodes that Dan and I were working\n\n85\n00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.460\ntogether in, and what we were doing is\nsimulating some attacks, virus attacks.\n\n86\n00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.760\nThere's only one real way\nto simulate a virus attack,\n\n87\n00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.300\nis to unleash the rattlesnakes\ninside of a computing system.\n\n88\n00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.760\nWell, we certainly don't want to\ndo that on our network, right?\n\n89\n00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.730\nWe do that, then all the other\ncomputers are vulnerable.\n\n90\n00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.730\nAnd you also have to be careful doing\nthis on your own local machines.\n\n91\n00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.760\nSo one of the things that we can do is,\nwhen we have VMs,\n\n92\n00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.690\nwe create what are known\nas these snapshots.\n\n93\n00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.480\nNow, they're called different things\ndepending on what virtualization\n\n94\n00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.480\ntechnology you're using.\n\n95\n00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.530\nSo for instance, in Hyper-V,\nthey use to be called snapshots,\n\n96\n00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.855\ntoday they're called checkpoints.\n\n97\n00:05:10.855 --> 00:05:15.470\nSo don't the let,\nwhatever they're calling it confuse you.\n\n98\n00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.500\nThis is a point in time identical\ncopy of the configuration,\n\n99\n00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.690\neverything that's on that machine.\n\n100\n00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.150\nLet me go ahead and\nshow you what I mean here.\n\n101\n00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.320\nSo I've got one of the virtual machines\nrunning in the background here, and\n\n102\n00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.610\nI'm using the VMware Fusion.\n\n103\n00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.890\nAnd this is a running machine.\n\n104\n00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.600\nIt's one of the ones I\nuse here in the show,\n\n105\n00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.700\nit's one of the ones I've\nused in the past in the show.\n\n106\n00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.305\nI've had to infect it before, right?\n\n107\n00:05:37.305 --> 00:05:42.810\nBecause I want to test these different\nsecurity processes in order to demonstrate\n\n108\n00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.490\nthem to you.\n\n109\n00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.490\nBut I want a way that I can make\nsure that, once I'm done doing that,\n\n110\n00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.320\nonce that virus might be in there.\n\n111\n00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.900\nOr maybe the software that I'm testing\nisn't worth it's weight in gold.\n\n112\n00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.250\nMaybe they put the money where the mouth\nis and, hey, it didn't solve the problem.\n\n113\n00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.910\nAnd now I've got a virtual\nmachine that's inside of my\n\n114\n00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.430\nsystem right now that's completely\ninfected and so, what do I do?\n\n115\n00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.200\nWell, this is the great thing and\n\n116\n00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.870\nthe security implementation\nwhen it comes to snapshots.\n\n117\n00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.030\nIf you do, in this case let's say\nI have a virtual machine, but\n\n118\n00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.790\nit's a production machine,\nand it gets a virus.\n\n119\n00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.450\nWhat is one of the things you can do?\n\n120\n00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.600\nAnd a little different depending\non what hypervisor we're using.\n\n121\n00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.180\nBut for me, it's going to be SnapShots.\n\n122\n00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.130\nNotice that I have this location\nup here that says snapshots and\n\n123\n00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.320\nif I click on that, alright,\nit's going to tell me,\n\n124\n00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.900\nbefore securities I have\nthis is security 10, right?\n\n125\n00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.860\nSo in some of the episodes\nthat I was doing,\n\n126\n00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.710\nwhere I had to infect\nthe machines on purpose,\n\n127\n00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.540\nI wanted a way to revert it back to\nthe prior state before it got infected.\n\n128\n00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.520\nWell, that's no different if you think in\nconcept if you got a production virtual\n\n129\n00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.540\nmachine, right?\n\n130\n00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.760\nAnd it gets a virus and you've tried and\n\n131\n00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.030\nyou've tried to fix the problem and\nmaybe it's a zero day exploit.\n\n132\n00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.780\nMaybe there isn't,\nyou know a fix for this.\n\n133\n00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.850\nSo how are you going to undo that?\n\n134\n00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.830\nHow are you going to protect yourself?\n\n135\n00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.480\nWell I can go in here, what I can do if\nI want is I can restore the snap shot.\n\n136\n00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.100\nAnd then what it does is wherever this\nmachine, in this case it's Windows 10 box,\n\n137\n00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.490\nwherever this machine is in it's\ncurrent state infected in everything,\n\n138\n00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.640\nI can revert it back to the earlier point\nin time before it got the infection.\n\n139\n00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.240\nNow like I said,\nwe use this in demonstrations, but\n\n140\n00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.440\nthis would be no different that what you\nwould do inside a production environment.\n\n141\n00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.260\nSo Dan, the snapshots,\nwhere do they come into play for security?\n\n142\n00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.450\nTake your snapshots,\ntake your checkpoints.\n\n143\n00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:29.900\nIf a machine gets infected,\nif it gets exploited,\n\n144\n00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.200\nyou can revert it back to an earlier\npoint in time and undo all those changes.\n\n145\n00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.490\n>> Yeah, actually it's kind of if you\nthink about it, it's a type of a backup.\n\n146\n00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.080\nAnd obviously what do backups do for us?\n\n147\n00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.670\nIf we have data breaches or infections,\n\n148\n00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.630\nwe can go back to a previous time before\nthat happened and retrieve our data.\n\n149\n00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:51.109\nSnapshots are a specific, really a scalpel\nfor a specific type of rolling back.\n\n150\n00:07:51.109 --> 00:07:54.779\nBut they can be very, very effective,\nI use them all the time,\n\n151\n00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:58.032\nespecially if I'm doing any kind of,\nlike what I said,\n\n152\n00:07:58.032 --> 00:08:02.688\nmaybe I have to infect a machine and to\nsee is this actually going to cause havoc?\n\n153\n00:08:02.688 --> 00:08:04.308\nOr is it innocuous.\n\n154\n00:08:04.308 --> 00:08:05.889\nI wanna test these things.\n\n155\n00:08:05.889 --> 00:08:10.372\nGreat for test but environments or\nif you are doing some sort of upgrading,\n\n156\n00:08:10.372 --> 00:08:11.520\nyou can roll back.\n\n157\n00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.070\nYou maybe make some\nconfiguration changes yourself.\n\n158\n00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.000\nToo far out in the weeds,\nyou can't find your way back,\n\n159\n00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.830\njust roll back a snapshot and\nyou're right back where you started from.\n\n160\n00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.960\nSo they're very,\nvery handy to have around.\n\n161\n00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.410\nNow that being said,\nwe're talking about the host security, but\n\n162\n00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.880\nwhat about our data itself?\n\n163\n00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.990\nWhat can we do to actually\nprotect our data?\n\n164\n00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.686\nAnd you know what, the answer to that\nis probably a little less snazzy,\n\n165\n00:08:34.686 --> 00:08:37.758\na little less glamorous\nthan you would think.\n\n166\n00:08:37.758 --> 00:08:40.696\nAnd it really boils down to one\nof our first lines of defense,\n\n167\n00:08:40.696 --> 00:08:42.780\nwhich is file permissions, right, Wes?\n\n168\n00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.860\n>> Definitely, we talk heavily in\nlike comp T courses and definitely\n\n169\n00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.670\nin the Microsoft courses about a concept\nknown as defense and depth, right.\n\n170\n00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:56.280\nNow, you can go to the bottom of\nthe defense and depth layered stack.\n\n171\n00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.220\nRight, this is a layer defense mechanism,\nright, a layer defense implementation.\n\n172\n00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.582\nWe don't just start with\nlike physical security.\n\n173\n00:09:03.582 --> 00:09:05.920\nWe start out with things like policy and\nawareness and\n\n174\n00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.600\nthen we go up to things\nlike physical security.\n\n175\n00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.030\nWe talk about network security,\n\n176\n00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.190\nall the way at the top of\nthe stack is the data security.\n\n177\n00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:17.170\nWe gotta make sure that the data that's\nrunning on the systems themselves\n\n178\n00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:17.830\nremains secure.\n\n179\n00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:18.460\nSo, how do we do that?\n\n180\n00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.260\nWe do that through the permissions and\naccess control lists.\n\n181\n00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.737\nLet me go ahead and\nshow you what I mean here.\n\n182\n00:09:22.737 --> 00:09:27.036\nInside of NTFS and\nWindows-based systems more specifically,\n\n183\n00:09:27.036 --> 00:09:29.510\nwe've got a series of permissions.\n\n184\n00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.022\nAll right, the permissions\ndefine what actions a user or\n\n185\n00:09:33.022 --> 00:09:37.631\na group, in this case you'll see that\nit's assigned to users and groups,\n\n186\n00:09:37.631 --> 00:09:42.188\nat what actions, what level of actions\ncan they perform on a file folder.\n\n187\n00:09:42.188 --> 00:09:44.500\nSo and I can show you that as well.\n\n188\n00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.866\nSo I've got one of the ACLs that they\ncall out, the access control list, right.\n\n189\n00:09:47.866 --> 00:09:50.699\nThis is, you've probably seen this in\nsome of our other episodes, right,\n\n190\n00:09:50.699 --> 00:09:52.220\nthe security tab.\n\n191\n00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.990\nWell we call it security tab from\nthe properties of any file or folder,\n\n192\n00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.750\nbut that technically is\nan access control list, right?\n\n193\n00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.940\nWe have our user here, in this case,\n\n194\n00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.990\nit's my account, that's the user account\nthat has a permission assigned to it.\n\n195\n00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.470\nAnd if I look down here at the bottom,\n\n196\n00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.060\nI can see all of these\ndifferent permissions, right.\n\n197\n00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.080\nFull control, modify, read,\nexecute, read and write.\n\n198\n00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.420\nThere's even one down here I think,\nspecial permissions.\n\n199\n00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.250\nWe'll talk a little bit\nabout that coming up.\n\n200\n00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.210\nBut I can also see here\nthat if I happen to select,\n\n201\n00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:23.119\nlet's say, say I select a group.\n\n202\n00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.110\nNow the group, same thing,\nnotice that there are allow permissions.\n\n203\n00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.250\nIt defines what level of access,\n\n204\n00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:34.270\nwhat actions can a user perform on or\nto a resource.\n\n205\n00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.580\nNow I say a resource,\nwhat do you mean by resources?\n\n206\n00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:42.000\nWell, we're only talking about this\nfrom the perspective of data security.\n\n207\n00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.290\nRight, a printer, shared resources, shared\nfolders, yes, printers are also resources,\n\n208\n00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:49.610\nso it could be devices\ngenerically speaking, too.\n\n209\n00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.430\nSo if I wanna implement any one of\nthese permissions within the ACL,\n\n210\n00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:57.310\nall I have to do is make sure\nthat the allow is checked.\n\n211\n00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.300\nRead permission does exactly\nwhat it sounds like.\n\n212\n00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:04.010\nIt gives the user the ability to\nread the contents of the document.\n\n213\n00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:04.970\nIf it's a write permission,\n\n214\n00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.800\nthen that gives them the ability\nto make changes to the document.\n\n215\n00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.658\nNow be careful with this one because\nread & execute is kinda interesting.\n\n216\n00:11:10.658 --> 00:11:13.030\nAll right, read & execute,\nyou have to have the read permission, but\n\n217\n00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:18.570\nwhat this means is that if it is some\nkind of program, it means exactly that.\n\n218\n00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.930\nI can execute it,\nI can launch the program.\n\n219\n00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.320\nI also have modify.\n\n220\n00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.460\nNow, what is the difference\nbetween modify and write, okay?\n\n221\n00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.530\nYou gotta be careful with the verbiage\non this one because if I say\n\n222\n00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.900\nthe write permission allows you to\nmake modifications to a document.\n\n223\n00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.140\nWell, what does modify do then?\n\n224\n00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:38.230\nWell one of the big differences here\nis that modify, a little bit more\n\n225\n00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.650\nhigher level of permissions because\nyou can also delete the document.\n\n226\n00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:43.130\nAll right, you can make changes.\n\n227\n00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.490\nAnd that's why I say the word changes.\n\n228\n00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:46.110\nWhen you have the write permission,\nyou can make changes.\n\n229\n00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.030\nYou can add text to a document.\n\n230\n00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.120\nYou can remove text.\n\n231\n00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.270\nYou can save that document.\n\n232\n00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.810\nBut what you can't do\nis delete the document.\n\n233\n00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.990\nAll right, now you might say,\nwhat's a scenario where I might use write?\n\n234\n00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.870\nWell, if you've got students out there,\nall right.\n\n235\n00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.860\nTeachers might have somebody that\nthey already created the document.\n\n236\n00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.900\nThey want them to have the ability to\nadd their test answers to the document.\n\n237\n00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.210\nAll right.\n\n238\n00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:07.970\nBut they don't want them to be\nable to delete the document.\n\n239\n00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:10.790\nSo that might be a scenario\nwhere you'd use this.\n\n240\n00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.290\nNow full control is another permission.\n\n241\n00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:13.650\nYou gotta be careful with this one.\n\n242\n00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:19.000\nBecause with full control,\nnot only can you modify, read,\n\n243\n00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.300\nexecute, read and write, but you also\nhave the ability to change permissions.\n\n244\n00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.660\nAll right, if I give Dan full control over\nthe patented information that I have on my\n\n245\n00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.000\ncomputer, I said, Dan,\nyou've got full control.\n\n246\n00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.830\nWell Dan could say, you know what?\n\n247\n00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.430\nYou're no longer the owner of it.\n\n248\n00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.980\nWell what do you mean?\n\n249\n00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.030\nI'm the one that created it.\n\n250\n00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.960\nWell, one of the things with the full\ncontrol permission is you can take\n\n251\n00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.620\nownership over a document.\n\n252\n00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.465\nYou gotta be careful with this one,\ncuz you can see administrators,\n\n253\n00:12:42.465 --> 00:12:43.504\nthey have it by default.\n\n254\n00:12:43.504 --> 00:12:46.875\nAll right, so, if you give somebody that\npermission, you're almost giving them\n\n255\n00:12:46.875 --> 00:12:51.010\nadministrative level control over that\nsingle file, so be careful with that one.\n\n256\n00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:55.220\nNow, this isn't the only location\nthat we have permissions, right?\n\n257\n00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.780\nNow I've kinda abbreviated this\nguy as nix-Based systems, right?\n\n258\n00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.360\nBecause if I say Linux, I mean,\nit all comes from Unix, right?\n\n259\n00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.430\nSo it's Unix or Linux.\n\n260\n00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.900\nAnd they have a series of permissions too.\n\n261\n00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.980\nNow theirs are more simplistic.\n\n262\n00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.080\nAnd it's one of the things\nthat's kinda neat here.\n\n263\n00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.140\nNTFS permissions can get very,\nvery granular.\n\n264\n00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:17.140\nAnd with that fire level of control could\ncome a nightmare in trying to figure out\n\n265\n00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.940\nwhy somebody doesn't have control or\nwhy somebody doesn't have access.\n\n266\n00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.886\nNix pay systems,\nlittle different here, right?\n\n267\n00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:26.110\nThey have the read permission,\nthey have the write permission and\n\n268\n00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.930\nthe execute permission.\n\n269\n00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.782\nAnd the way that we see these are a little\nbit different than what we see in\n\n270\n00:13:29.782 --> 00:13:33.530\nthe graphical user interface inside of the\nNTFS or WIndows-based environments, right.\n\n271\n00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:37.440\nWe have three different types\nof permissions that can be set.\n\n272\n00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.920\nThey could be the file owner, right,\nor directory owner, the group, right,\n\n273\n00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.650\na group that has access to this file,\n\n274\n00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.880\nwe could set up by the group basis,\nand everybody else on the machine.\n\n275\n00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.635\nIn fact,\nwe can kind of show you this here.\n\n276\n00:13:50.635 --> 00:13:53.836\nIf I open my terminal here on my Mac, and\n\n277\n00:13:53.836 --> 00:13:59.953\nlet's make that a little easier to\nsee here, and change directories too.\n\n278\n00:14:03.658 --> 00:14:07.570\nAll right, and we do our LS option here.\n\n279\n00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:11.870\nI can see I have a whole bunch of\nfiles and directories here, all right.\n\n280\n00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.460\nAnd notice how it's broken down, right?\n\n281\n00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.700\nNotice you've got the first set of\npermissions, read, write, execute.\n\n282\n00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.650\nRead, write and execute for the second\nset of permissions going to the group.\n\n283\n00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.640\nAnd then everybody else.\n\n284\n00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:27.220\nSo you also have the ability to set\nan access control list here, right?\n\n285\n00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:33.130\nSo, if you're familiar\nwith the NTFS in general,\n\n286\n00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:37.310\ndon't get that confused when we say\nACLs as being something that's only in\n\n287\n00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.862\na nix-Based system versus\na Windows-based system, right?\n\n288\n00:14:40.862 --> 00:14:43.360\nIn Windows-based system, we see it through\nthe graphical user interface when we\n\n289\n00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.618\ntypically look at that security tab.\n\n290\n00:14:44.618 --> 00:14:47.720\nAll right, nix-based systems, you don't\nreally get all the training wheels, right.\n\n291\n00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.757\nYou wanna start setting some permissions,\n\n292\n00:14:49.757 --> 00:14:53.016\nyou might have to get a little\nin-depth inside of the terminal there.\n\n293\n00:14:53.016 --> 00:14:57.052\nSo we do have the ability, Dan,\nto set those permissions and again,\n\n294\n00:14:57.052 --> 00:14:59.270\nit is an access control list.\n\n295\n00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.310\nAnd it's based on identity.\n\n296\n00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:03.170\nIt's something that we call\ndiscretionary access control, all right.\n\n297\n00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.750\nWe base it on the identity of the user or\nthe group.\n\n298\n00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:10.380\nOr in this case, maybe even the group\nthat the users are a part of.\n\n299\n00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:15.280\nVery easy way to secure your data and\nensure that people only have access,\n\n300\n00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.570\nyou know the people you want, and also the\nlevel of access that you want any file or\n\n301\n00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:20.910\ndirectory on your systems.\n\n302\n00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:21.610\n>> And that's right.\n\n303\n00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:26.160\nNow that being said, we're talking about\nusers and how they have access and\n\n304\n00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.690\nwe give them access using these\naccess control lists, very cool.\n\n305\n00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:34.810\nBut how does a person even get to that\npoint where they are in the system?\n\n306\n00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.430\nAnd that's authentication, right?\n\n307\n00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:40.610\nWe have to authenticate in the system,\nI am a user, I belong on this system,\n\n308\n00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:44.490\nI have some method to let you\nknow that I am who I say I am.\n\n309\n00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:48.870\nAnd then you grant me access based off\nof that information if it all comports.\n\n310\n00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:52.631\nThat being said, Wes, I know we have a\nspecific type of authentication that we're\n\n311\n00:15:52.631 --> 00:15:56.135\ngoing to at least mention today and\nkind of give a run-down on it.\n\n312\n00:15:56.135 --> 00:15:56.895\n>> We have to.\n\n313\n00:15:56.895 --> 00:15:58.935\nIt's one of the ones that's\ncalled out on the exam, and\n\n314\n00:15:58.935 --> 00:16:00.875\nyou really aren't gonna see it in action.\n\n315\n00:16:00.875 --> 00:16:02.901\nIt's gonna be one of those things,\nand it's gonna be more.\n\n316\n00:16:02.901 --> 00:16:07.142\nIf you think of inside of the real\nworld versus paper-based and\n\n317\n00:16:07.142 --> 00:16:08.748\nmaybe theory, right?\n\n318\n00:16:08.748 --> 00:16:13.632\nIn past episodes, we've talked a lot about\nthe terminal access control access control\n\n319\n00:16:13.632 --> 00:16:16.478\nsystem inside of Cisco-based,\nwell, systems.\n\n320\n00:16:16.478 --> 00:16:17.598\nThat's a lot of systems, right?\n\n321\n00:16:17.598 --> 00:16:18.378\n>> That's a lot of systems.\n\n322\n00:16:18.378 --> 00:16:21.510\n>> [LAUGH] Redundant systems,\nthat is what we wanna hear.\n\n323\n00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:22.930\nIt's akin to Radius, right?\n\n324\n00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.710\nRadius, a little bit different\nbecause it uses UDP.\n\n325\n00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:29.963\nIt's not an encryption wide process.\n\n326\n00:16:29.963 --> 00:16:31.474\nThe TACACS, if you will,\n\n327\n00:16:31.474 --> 00:16:36.830\nTerminal Access Control Access Control\nSystem is what they use inside of Cisco.\n\n328\n00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.380\nLike, well,\nit's an authentication mechanism, but\n\n329\n00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.500\nthe difference is it uses TCP and it's\nencryption, it's a full wide encryption.\n\n330\n00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.370\nGo back and\ncheck out those episodes, right?\n\n331\n00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:49.010\nCuz I do mention TACACS and\nTACACS+ is what we're using today.\n\n332\n00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:54.040\nWe wouldn't have you completely prepared\nif we didn't mention one that you're\n\n333\n00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.400\nprobably not gonna see in existence.\n\n334\n00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.490\nAnd that's called Extended TACACS, right,\n\n335\n00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:02.106\nit was just a little bit after TACACS,\nprior to TACACS+.\n\n336\n00:17:02.106 --> 00:17:04.120\nSo just be aware that it's out there.\n\n337\n00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.390\nNot really out there [LAUGH],\nyou're not really gonna see it too much.\n\n338\n00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:08.340\nBut be aware that they\ncall it out on the exam.\n\n339\n00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.030\nSo if they ask you,\nyou need an authentication mechanism,\n\n340\n00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.190\nwhich of these, choose three, they might\nsay something like that, choose three,\n\n341\n00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:17.800\nwhich ones provide\ncentralized authentication?\n\n342\n00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:23.030\nAll right?\nRadius, TACACS, TACACS+, and XTACACS.\n\n343\n00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.560\nRemember them just for\nthe exam and you should be good.\n\n344\n00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.230\n>> Awesome stuff.\n\n345\n00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.890\nYeah, every now and then that is just the\ncase, you're gonna have some systems that\n\n346\n00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:33.200\nthey just want you to be familiar with and\nunderstand what it is and what it does.\n\n347\n00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.350\nThat happens to be one of them.\n\n348\n00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:35.320\nSo, like Wes said,\n\n349\n00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.768\nyou're not gonna have to know the ins and\nouts of XTACACS to pass the exam.\n\n350\n00:17:39.768 --> 00:17:43.030\nYou're just gonna have to be familiar\nwith what it is and what it does.\n\n351\n00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.200\nAnd that is authentication.\n\n352\n00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.510\nSpeaking of authentication,\n\n353\n00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:50.668\nwe're continuing on with that theme\nwith getting into some user security.\n\n354\n00:17:50.668 --> 00:17:54.360\nReally, we wanna make sure that\nthe way we implement users and\n\n355\n00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.160\nidentities inside of our systems\nare as secure as they can be.\n\n356\n00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.940\nAnd we do that through type of policy.\n\n357\n00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:04.280\nIt might not be an actual computer policy,\nbut a written policy.\n\n358\n00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.140\nHere's how we do things, and Wes,\n\n359\n00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.180\nthat's another topic you're\ngonna talk about right now.\n\n360\n00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.590\n>> Definitely, according to your security\npolicies, like Dan's mentioning, right?\n\n361\n00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.330\nWhat is the security stance\nthat your company has?\n\n362\n00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:17.910\nThey might have limitations on certain\ntypes of accounts that you can create.\n\n363\n00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.560\nAll right, now as far as\nthe best security practice is,\n\n364\n00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.300\nwhether they have a policy\nthat states this or\n\n365\n00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.390\nnot, you need to be aware of some of\nthe risks, and definitely for the exam.\n\n366\n00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:29.696\nIt's something known as a generic account,\nmy cause, right?\n\n367\n00:18:29.696 --> 00:18:32.247\nSo one of the things that they call out\nis something called a generic account\n\n368\n00:18:32.247 --> 00:18:33.160\nprohibition.\n\n369\n00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:37.120\nAnd what this means is first of all being\naware of what generic accounts are to\n\n370\n00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.100\nbegin with on the exam is\ngonna help you out a lot and\n\n371\n00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.790\nthen knowing some of\nthe security risks behind them.\n\n372\n00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:44.020\nSo let me show you what I mean here.\n\n373\n00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.800\nSo when we talk about generic accounts,\n\n374\n00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.130\nthere are some that we may not\neven consider being generic or\n\n375\n00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.850\nmaybe we overlook the fact\nthat they're generic, right.\n\n376\n00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:53.980\nAnd some of the anonymous accounts,\nin fact Dan and\n\n377\n00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:57.780\nI were kind of talking about some of the\nsecurity risks behind the scenes before\n\n378\n00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.160\nwe started, with things like\nanonymous accounts, right?\n\n379\n00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.057\nAnonymous accounts, we're talking\nabout things like FTP logins,\n\n380\n00:19:04.057 --> 00:19:07.898\nyou guys have seen in this series\nwhere we've warned you about FTP.\n\n381\n00:19:07.898 --> 00:19:09.423\nIt's not secure, and\n\n382\n00:19:09.423 --> 00:19:14.079\nit does have some problems that if\nit's not configured correctly can\n\n383\n00:19:14.079 --> 00:19:18.510\nallow somebody to anonymously log\non to your FTP server, right?\n\n384\n00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:21.200\nAnd that leads into other\nattacks like FTP bounce attacks,\n\n385\n00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.660\nwhere if I can connect to your server.\n\n386\n00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:26.038\nRemember one of the ten\nimmutable laws of security?\n\n387\n00:19:26.038 --> 00:19:29.100\nIf I have access to your server,\nit's no longer your server.\n\n388\n00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.680\nSo, if I can log on anonymously and\nyou don't even know who I am,\n\n389\n00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.140\nthen I can bounce an attack off to your\nserver to somebody else's, and guess what?\n\n390\n00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:38.070\nIt's not gonna be me that's gonna\nbe charged with any civil or\n\n391\n00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.790\ncriminal litigations, it's gonna be you.\n\n392\n00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:42.170\nSo we have to worry about\nanonymous log ons like that.\n\n393\n00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.750\nThe other one is like a guest account.\n\n394\n00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:47.030\nYou might say well,\nwe don't use the guest accounts, right?\n\n395\n00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:48.250\nDan and I both have Macbooks,\n\n396\n00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.360\nand have you ever signed into\nthe guest account on your machine?\n\n397\n00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.100\n>> Zero times.\n\n398\n00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:51.700\n>> Yep, I haven't either.\n\n399\n00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.870\nAnd you've got some built in guest\naccounts that are in Windows, and\n\n400\n00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.620\nthey're disabled by default for a reason.\n\n401\n00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:01.100\nAll right, and we're gonna talk about one\nof the problems with those coming up.\n\n402\n00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.845\nOther types of accounts that maybe we\ndon't even think of as being a generic\n\n403\n00:20:03.845 --> 00:20:06.400\naccount, you wouldn't say\nan administrator account.\n\n404\n00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.780\nThat's generic, no, or it's not generic.\n\n405\n00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:09.485\nWell, yes it is.\n\n406\n00:20:09.485 --> 00:20:13.030\nIf you think about it, when you log in\nas a default Windows administrator,\n\n407\n00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:18.440\nvery hard to prove outside of maybe\nonly who had those credentials,\n\n408\n00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.920\nbut you can't really track it, right?\n\n409\n00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.870\nSo a Windows administrative\naccount is a very generic account.\n\n410\n00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.090\nThe root user, right?\n\n411\n00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.570\nYou're warned,\ndon't log in as root user, right?\n\n412\n00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.790\nBecause then you have complete\nadministrative access over it.\n\n413\n00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:30.960\nBut sometimes we do it, right?\n\n414\n00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.190\nSo that's another generic account.\n\n415\n00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:36.700\nThe problem is if it doesn't have\na specific identity tied to it.\n\n416\n00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.550\nIt's gonna cause problems as well.\n\n417\n00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.740\nOne of the last types of accounts\nis like a batch processing account.\n\n418\n00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.480\nRight, maybe you have a generic account\nthat needs to do script automation,\n\n419\n00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.268\nlike maybe automating user creation,\nright.\n\n420\n00:20:47.268 --> 00:20:50.953\nI don't wanna have to sit there and\ngo through the tedious process of creating\n\n421\n00:20:50.953 --> 00:20:53.518\nan individual user,\nassigning all the attributes.\n\n422\n00:20:53.518 --> 00:20:57.101\nIf I know that I have 50 people,\n100 people in the same division,\n\n423\n00:20:57.101 --> 00:21:01.293\nwe just create an account, run a batch\nscript, creates all those user accounts,\n\n424\n00:21:01.293 --> 00:21:03.010\nand we're good to go.\n\n425\n00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:06.020\nProblem is that generic account,\nall right.\n\n426\n00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.770\nSo what is it that causes\nproblems with this?\n\n427\n00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:11.170\nHere are some of the potential issues,\nall right.\n\n428\n00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:12.180\nIn Security+,\n\n429\n00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.230\nwe talk about these as being things\nthat you need to make sure you have.\n\n430\n00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.360\nAccountability, all right.\n\n431\n00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.410\nAnd with a generic account,\nyou don't have accountability.\n\n432\n00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:23.260\nI can't say Dan,\nthat was you that logged in.\n\n433\n00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:27.020\nDan could say no, it wasn't me, wasn't me,\nI was sitting on my couch that night and\n\n434\n00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.590\nthere's nothing you can do to prove it.\n\n435\n00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:30.840\nWhy not?\nI don't have auditing.\n\n436\n00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.370\nNow, I know I'm kinda jumping around\nhere but auditing, I can't sit there and\n\n437\n00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:34.870\ntrack that and look at the audit logs and\n\n438\n00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:39.180\nsay yeah, that was you Dan,\nno it says administrator.\n\n439\n00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.860\nIt says, root.\n\n440\n00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:44.370\nThere's no real way that\nyou can track that.\n\n441\n00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:48.193\nAnd this is where the middle\noption comes in, non-repudiation.\n\n442\n00:21:48.193 --> 00:21:52.076\nAll right, we want non-repudiation,\nwe wanna make sure from a data sense,\n\n443\n00:21:52.076 --> 00:21:56.158\nright, that the data that starts with\na user remains associated with that user.\n\n444\n00:21:56.158 --> 00:21:59.462\nAnd they can't refute the fact later that,\nlike I said, Dan says no,\n\n445\n00:21:59.462 --> 00:22:01.780\nI was at home, I was on my couch, right?\n\n446\n00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.680\nSo we don't get the non-repudiation.\n\n447\n00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.840\nAll right, we wanna make sure that not\nonly data stays associated with somebody,\n\n448\n00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.110\nwe wanna make sure that all\nsystem wide activities stay\n\n449\n00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.770\naccountable to the user that's logged in,\nand that's where the problem comes in.\n\n450\n00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:19.260\nFinally what that does to us,\nIt's an administrative complexity, right?\n\n451\n00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:20.230\nIt's a burden.\n\n452\n00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:21.410\nThe audit trail isn't there.\n\n453\n00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.450\nWe can't track those activities.\n\n454\n00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:27.930\nWe might know a time that somebody did\nsomething, somebody, somewhere, somehow.\n\n455\n00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.270\nBut you see how generic that is.\n\n456\n00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:33.660\nAnd that's why the generic\naccounts are not really,\n\n457\n00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.405\nyou've just gotta be aware of them, right?\n\n458\n00:22:35.405 --> 00:22:36.490\nAnd definitely be aware of them for\n\n459\n00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:41.010\nthe exam because they could cause some\nvery big security vulnerabilities.\n\n460\n00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:41.910\n>> That's right.\n\n461\n00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:43.220\nWhen it comes to your users and\n\n462\n00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:46.090\nyour identities,\nwe don't wanna obfuscate the issue.\n\n463\n00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:49.330\nWe wanna make it very clear who logged in,\nwhat time, when,\n\n464\n00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.220\nwhere, why, how, that is\nthe particulars that we need to know.\n\n465\n00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.740\nThat way, if something goes either\nwrong or just something's happening and\n\n466\n00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.280\nI need information on it,\nI know exactly where to start looking.\n\n467\n00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.340\nWhen we start spreading that out,\n\n468\n00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:06.280\nI don't know who's logging in as guest\naccount, or administrator, or root.\n\n469\n00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:10.420\nNow you start to see why it's advised for\nus to not use those accounts,\n\n470\n00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.490\nor at least limit our\nuse of those accounts.\n\n471\n00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:16.530\nBecause no one has any idea\nwho that is when they log in.\n\n472\n00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:19.310\nThey just have when they logged in and\nwho they logged in as.\n\n473\n00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:21.570\nThere is no identity associated with it.\n\n474\n00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:25.900\nNow speaking of obfuscation,\nkinda switching gears here,\n\n475\n00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.190\nsometimes we do wanna obfuscate the issue.\n\n476\n00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:34.060\nWe've flipped this coin on its head, and\nI want my data to not be easily read or\n\n477\n00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.890\nseen or intercepted by a third party.\n\n478\n00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:38.520\nAnd we do that through cryptography,\nright,\n\n479\n00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.060\nI always love to make the joke that we're\ngonna dabble in the dark arts because\n\n480\n00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:46.080\nit's a level of mysterion\nthat goes with it, right?\n\n481\n00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.510\nWe're using cryptography.\n\n482\n00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:52.150\nWe're taking math and throwing it at data,\nand it's jumbling it up so that only\n\n483\n00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:57.100\nthe person with the correct cipher code or\nkey code can actually see what's going on.\n\n484\n00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:00.050\nAnd Wes, you've got a couple of types\nof cryptography that we're gonna talk\n\n485\n00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:00.910\nabout today, right?\n\n486\n00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:03.313\n>> That's right.\nIt's a couple that we kinda gotta round\n\n487\n00:24:03.313 --> 00:24:07.408\noff in all of the different encryption\nalgorithms we talk about throughout\n\n488\n00:24:07.408 --> 00:24:11.388\nSecurity plus and this is one that,\na couple that we need to worry about.\n\n489\n00:24:11.388 --> 00:24:14.141\nAnd the first one is one that is fresh and\nready to use.\n\n490\n00:24:14.141 --> 00:24:15.464\nWhat am I talking about?\n\n491\n00:24:15.464 --> 00:24:17.810\nI'm talking about something\nthat is known as RIPEMD.\n\n492\n00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:22.300\nOkay, [LAUGH] all joking aside, sometimes\nthey do call it ripe message digest.\n\n493\n00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:26.650\nAnd that's the RACE Integrity\nPrimitives Evaluation Message Digest.\n\n494\n00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:30.180\nAll right,\nnow this is one that is a lot like SHA-1.\n\n495\n00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.450\nOkay, and kind of a recap to some of the\nother episodes that we had where we talk\n\n496\n00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:35.150\nabout the secure hashing algorithm.\n\n497\n00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:36.760\nSorry for the alphabet soup out there.\n\n498\n00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.755\nSecure hashing algorithm,\nit's another form of a message digest.\n\n499\n00:24:39.755 --> 00:24:44.230\nNow SHA-1 is 160 bits,\nmessage digest, a one-way encryption.\n\n500\n00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.210\nAnd RIPEMD is like that.\n\n501\n00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:50.700\nNow RIPEMD, we've got version one and\nwe've got version two.\n\n502\n00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.448\nAll right,\nthe second version is called RIPEMD 160.\n\n503\n00:24:53.448 --> 00:24:57.570\nNow, why do they need two versions?\n\n504\n00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:01.413\nWell, the first version was susceptible\nto what's known as collision attacks.\n\n505\n00:25:01.413 --> 00:25:05.805\nA message digest is a hash value,\nit's a fixed-linked value.\n\n506\n00:25:05.805 --> 00:25:09.925\nWell, if I've got a whole database\nof those values we can try to find\n\n507\n00:25:09.925 --> 00:25:14.720\nthe collisions that will match those\nregardless of what the original text is.\n\n508\n00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.910\nSo, a collision attack and\n\n509\n00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.805\nat RIPEMD, the first version\nof it was susceptible to that.\n\n510\n00:25:19.805 --> 00:25:24.460\nRIPEMD 160 we don't have to worry\nabout those collision attacks.\n\n511\n00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.690\nNow the other one that we also\nhave to talk about very briefly,\n\n512\n00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:27.640\nthis one's actually kind of cool.\n\n513\n00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.942\nThis is inside of NIX based systems and\nthat's called bcrypt.\n\n514\n00:25:30.942 --> 00:25:33.108\nNow bcrypt is OTP, it's a one time pad.\n\n515\n00:25:33.108 --> 00:25:39.070\nAll right, and this is the way that you\ncan keep your user's credentials safe.\n\n516\n00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:42.300\nNow it does a lot more than that,\ntrust me.\n\n517\n00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.350\nBut for the exam,\nknow that it's that same digest,\n\n518\n00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:50.720\nthat one way encryption of\nyour username and password.\n\n519\n00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:54.090\nNow bcrypt, it's cross platform,\nfile encryption utility, so\n\n520\n00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:57.760\nit also will do things like file\nencryption which is very cool.\n\n521\n00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.270\nOne of the things that it also will do\nis that If you're gonna delete a file\n\n522\n00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:06.830\ninside a Unix based system, before\nit does that it randomizes the data.\n\n523\n00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.650\nIt overwrites the data before it\ndeletes the file so it's very good.\n\n524\n00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:13.370\nJust keep in mind it's a way\nto keep those passwords\n\n525\n00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:15.500\nhashed inside of Nix-based systems.\n\n526\n00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.980\nIt works with things like free BSD,\nopen BSD, Solaris,\n\n527\n00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:23.480\nwhether you're talking about Sun Solaris\nor Oracle Solaris there I believe.\n\n528\n00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:27.790\nMAC, it's on MAC Server,\nit's also on HP-UX.\n\n529\n00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:31.050\nSo, a couple of those technologies or\nencryptions that you have to be aware of.\n\n530\n00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:35.705\n>> Yeah, and continuing on the vein of\ncryptography, we'd be remiss to not get\n\n531\n00:26:35.705 --> 00:26:40.440\ninto to the, some of the particulars\nof PKI, public key infrastructure.\n\n532\n00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:44.140\nThis is a very common form of\ncryptographic system that we use.\n\n533\n00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.380\nAnd you got an interesting one for\nus today when it comes to PKI.\n\n534\n00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:47.920\n>> That's right,\n\n535\n00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.420\nso, one of the things that we have\nto add in there is a PKI, right?\n\n536\n00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.330\nWhat does that mean?\n\n537\n00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:54.920\nThat means public key infrastructure.\n\n538\n00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.726\nWe use digital certificates, and\n\n539\n00:26:56.726 --> 00:26:59.974\nit's how we keep things like\nworld wide e-commerce secure.\n\n540\n00:26:59.974 --> 00:27:04.158\nNow, one of the components inside of the\nPKI is something known as the registration\n\n541\n00:27:04.158 --> 00:27:05.370\nauthority.\n\n542\n00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:09.190\nNow, with the registration authority,\nlet's take a look at this.\n\n543\n00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:13.140\nNow the registration authority is\ninteresting because it sits in between\n\n544\n00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:17.740\na user's request here for\na certificate and the authority.\n\n545\n00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:18.790\nIn this case,\n\n546\n00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:22.190\nthe CA, certificate authority, that\nwe've talked about in previous episode.\n\n547\n00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:24.020\nSo what does a registration\nauthority do for us?\n\n548\n00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.580\nWell, it can do a few things.\n\n549\n00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:29.760\nSome of the things, one of the main\nthings that it does is that it verifies\n\n550\n00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.160\nthe user information, right.\n\n551\n00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.190\nIf a user requests a digital certificate,\n\n552\n00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:37.180\ndigital certificate is gonna be\npotentially issued back to the user and\n\n553\n00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:41.030\nwe certainly don't want digital server\ncertificates being compromised.\n\n554\n00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.800\nSo rather than have your request go\ndirectly to the certificate authority,\n\n555\n00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:45.870\nwe put a middle man there.\n\n556\n00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:47.170\nWe put the registration authority.\n\n557\n00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:50.400\nThe registration authority\ninspects the request and\n\n558\n00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.610\nthen also inspects the user and their\ninformation that's making the request.\n\n559\n00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:59.757\nNow it can verify also that the user has\nthe permissions to even make the request,\n\n560\n00:27:59.757 --> 00:28:00.296\nright.\n\n561\n00:28:00.296 --> 00:28:02.907\nIn your PKI,\nyour public key infrastructure,\n\n562\n00:28:02.907 --> 00:28:05.454\nespecially inside of\na Windows environment,\n\n563\n00:28:05.454 --> 00:28:09.780\nyou have to have the enroll permission to\neven be able to ask for a certificate.\n\n564\n00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:11.359\nTo even make a certificate request.\n\n565\n00:28:11.359 --> 00:28:15.110\nSo it does look in and\ninspect that information.\n\n566\n00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:17.620\nThere's other types of\nRegistration Authorities out there.\n\n567\n00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:22.040\nSo, for instance, a Network Access\nProtection in Server 2008 and 2008 R2,\n\n568\n00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:28.470\nyou could have what's known as an HRA,\na Health Registration Authority.\n\n569\n00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:29.310\nSo what do we have?\n\n570\n00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:32.380\nWe have a health certificate\nthat requires your computer.\n\n571\n00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:37.210\nIf your computer is gonna request your\ncertificate, right, to be authenticated.\n\n572\n00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:41.970\nNow before that certificate is gonna be\nissued to the computer, the computer has\n\n573\n00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:46.690\nto send to the health registration\nauthority a statement of health that says\n\n574\n00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:51.860\nyes, I have my firewall turned on\ngot my Windows updates ready to go.\n\n575\n00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.396\nAny malware, antivirus, and updates\nare some of the main things, right.\n\n576\n00:28:57.396 --> 00:29:00.727\nAnd if the registration authority\nlooks at that statement of health,\n\n577\n00:29:00.727 --> 00:29:03.268\nthe health registration authority,\nand says okay,\n\n578\n00:29:03.268 --> 00:29:06.100\nI see that the policy says you\nhave to have your firewall on.\n\n579\n00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.363\nYou're firewall is not on, right.\n\n580\n00:29:08.363 --> 00:29:11.938\nThe certificate request doesn't go\nto the certificate authority because\n\n581\n00:29:11.938 --> 00:29:15.853\nthe registration authority is the one\nthat's gonna validate that information,\n\n582\n00:29:15.853 --> 00:29:17.170\nand it has to be validated.\n\n583\n00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:23.420\nIt has to be approved by the HRA\nbefore it can ever be issued out.\n\n584\n00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.480\nSo keep in mind, just one of the\ncomponents that we want to throw in there\n\n585\n00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.640\nis that registration authority that\nbasically is an intercepts if you will.\n\n586\n00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.920\nANd I don't want to say intercepts.\n\n587\n00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.800\nIt actually,\nthe request is sent directly to it.\n\n588\n00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:37.480\nIt says okay user 01,\nI see that you have the enroll permission.\n\n589\n00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.620\nYou are user 01,\nyour credentials are validated.\n\n590\n00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:43.840\nIf there is a certificate request\npolicy that we have to follow\n\n591\n00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.730\nit inspects that policy.\n\n592\n00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:48.360\nEverything's good,\nit sends the request over to the CA.\n\n593\n00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.880\nAnd the certificate authority\nissues the certificate.\n\n594\n00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.440\nIf not,\nconnection is lost right there, and\n\n595\n00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.420\nwe don't have to worry about\na fraudulent certificate.\n\n596\n00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.520\nAnd it's interesting,\nit's not a fraudulent certificate,\n\n597\n00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.960\nit's a certificate that would be\nconsidered legitimate within my company.\n\n598\n00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.050\nThe problem is we don't want that\ncertificate to be given to just anybody.\n\n599\n00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:09.660\nRegistration authority validates that,\nand makes sure that doesn't happen.\n\n600\n00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:14.450\n>> Yeah, that's a key piece of ingredient\nthere of the PKI infrastructure,\n\n601\n00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:18.365\nthat you probably want to implement\nif you do have the means for that.\n\n602\n00:30:18.365 --> 00:30:20.140\nWes, we've covered a lot of ground today.\n\n603\n00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.540\nIs there anything else that we\nneed to cover before we sign off?\n\n604\n00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.360\n>> Nope,\njust keep in mind your acronyms and\n\n605\n00:30:26.665 --> 00:30:28.305\nwe're never short of alphabet soup here.\n\n606\n00:30:28.305 --> 00:30:30.215\nJust so they, they do like their acronyms.\n\n607\n00:30:30.215 --> 00:30:32.315\nPay attention to those\nencryption algorithms.\n\n608\n00:30:32.315 --> 00:30:35.355\nStudy them, make sure that you can\nidentify them on the exam, and\n\n609\n00:30:35.355 --> 00:30:36.105\nyou should be good.\n\n610\n00:30:36.105 --> 00:30:37.655\n>> Excellent stuff,\nwell we thank you, Wes, so\n\n611\n00:30:37.655 --> 00:30:41.297\nmuch for joining us today and\nexplaining these key concepts to us.\n\n612\n00:30:41.297 --> 00:30:42.937\nAnd all that's very good stuff.\n\n613\n00:30:42.937 --> 00:30:45.287\nThat being said, it is time to sign off.\n\n614\n00:30:45.287 --> 00:30:47.907\nFor ITProTV, thank you guys so\nmuch for watching.\n\n615\n00:30:47.907 --> 00:30:49.157\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n616\n00:30:49.157 --> 00:30:49.907\n>> And I'm Wes Ryan.\n\n617\n00:30:49.907 --> 00:30:52.277\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n618\n00:30:52.277 --> 00:30:58.900\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
