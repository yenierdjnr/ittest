a new\nshow that we're producing on\n\n4\n00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:13.767\nWindows Server 101.\n\n5\n00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:17.045\nNow if you're wondering,\nwhat the heck is Windows Server 101 about?\n\n6\n00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:18.052\nThat's a great question.\n\n7\n00:00:18.052 --> 00:00:22.156\nWhat we found out is that there is a\nknowledge gap that you may have if you've\n\n8\n00:00:22.156 --> 00:00:24.590\njust come from studying A+ and Network+.\n\n9\n00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.752\nAnd say, hey,\nI'm about to jump into the MCSA track.\n\n10\n00:00:27.752 --> 00:00:30.204\nBut then you feel\na little bit overwhelmed,\n\n11\n00:00:30.204 --> 00:00:34.790\nbecause there is a ton of knowledge\nright there inside of that MCSA track.\n\n12\n00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.185\nWell, this is going to fill in that gap of\nthe server knowledge that you'll need as\n\n13\n00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:40.660\nyou go in to that training.\n\n14\n00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.975\nAlso, you may be doing\ndesktop support right now in\n\n15\n00:00:43.975 --> 00:00:47.860\nwhich you haven't had any\nreal server experience.\n\n16\n00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.368\nThis show will at least help you get\nsettled and started, and feeling\n\n17\n00:00:51.368 --> 00:00:55.556\ncomfortable in that server knowledge, and\nprovide you the skills that you need.\n\n18\n00:00:55.556 --> 00:01:00.413\nNow this particular show is going to\nbe produced around a book by one of\n\n19\n00:01:00.413 --> 00:01:04.880\nour subject matters that we had\ncome in called Brian Sviderol.\n\n20\n00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.266\nBrian Svidergol wrote a book\ncalled Windows Server 101.\n\n21\n00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:10.500\nLet me show you what I'm\ntalking about right here.\n\n22\n00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.938\nSo here on my screen, it is an e-book and\n\n23\n00:01:13.938 --> 00:01:17.489\nthe great thing is it will be free for\nyou.\n\n24\n00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:20.476\nSo, Brian has actually released\nthis out into the public.\n\n25\n00:01:20.476 --> 00:01:25.413\nAnd here at ITProTV, we've obtained\npermission to also produce a show\n\n26\n00:01:25.413 --> 00:01:30.620\ngiving the content or surrounding\nthe content of this book as well.\n\n27\n00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.667\nAnd you'll actually see\nright here in his abstract,\n\n28\n00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:38.610\naimed as an introduction to Windows Server\nprovides an overview of administration and\n\n29\n00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.487\nmanagement for Windows Server operating\nsystem without any prerequisite knowledge\n\n30\n00:01:43.487 --> 00:01:46.830\nof Windows Server is necessary and\nthat is the whole goal.\n\n31\n00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.212\nSo if you are actually saying,\nI need to learn more about Windows Server,\n\n32\n00:01:51.212 --> 00:01:52.708\nthis is the show for you.\n\n33\n00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:54.839\nIf you're getting ready\nto take the MCSA or\n\n34\n00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:58.033\nto take that track on, well,\nthis is the show for you as well that\n\n35\n00:01:58.033 --> 00:02:02.520\nwe'll get you comfortable with the\nknowledge and the material that you need.\n\n36\n00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.910\nNow, this particular show though is not\nbased around any particular exam at all.\n\n37\n00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.428\nSo, there are no real\nobjectives that are met.\n\n38\n00:02:10.428 --> 00:02:11.616\nHere at ITProTV,\n\n39\n00:02:11.616 --> 00:02:16.960\nwe wanted to make sure that we gave you\nthe best possible chance at exceeding.\n\n40\n00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.140\nAnd of course, succeeding on\nyour MCSA skills as you move on.\n\n41\n00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.640\nSo, what are some of the things\nthat we'll be covering?\n\n42\n00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.719\nWell, Brian's book is actually divided\nup into five different parts and\n\n43\n00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.970\nthere's actually 24\ndifferent chapters in it.\n\n44\n00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.614\nWe tried to actually produce,\nwell, either a single a show or\n\n45\n00:02:35.614 --> 00:02:39.970\nmultiple shows around those particular\nchapters that will help you out.\n\n46\n00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.325\nSo what you'll actually see in this\nparticular show that's coming up is that\n\n47\n00:02:44.325 --> 00:02:48.613\nyou'll see different episodes based\non just basic server fundamentals and\n\n48\n00:02:48.613 --> 00:02:52.298\nthis is where we get you familiar\nwith Windows Server itself, and\n\n49\n00:02:52.298 --> 00:02:55.380\nunderstanding the functions,\nand the features, and\n\n50\n00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.600\nhow to do a few things that you\nmay not have actually done before.\n\n51\n00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.913\nYou're also of course, going to see the\nidea of networking components that we find\n\n52\n00:03:03.913 --> 00:03:07.750\nin Windows Server itself and we'll\ntalk about some of the details there.\n\n53\n00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.543\nAnd o course,\n\n54\n00:03:08.543 --> 00:03:12.843\nyour basic Network+ knowledge is going\nto be of tremendous help for you as you\n\n55\n00:03:12.843 --> 00:03:18.160\ncontinue to go through those particular\nsections that we'll cover in there.\n\n56\n00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.530\nThen we'll expose you to\nthe basics of Active Directory,\n\n57\n00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.644\ndirectory services as well\nalong with group policy.\n\n58\n00:03:24.644 --> 00:03:28.180\nAnd we'll talk about managing user\naccounts and computer accounts.\n\n59\n00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.784\nWe'll even see the use of group policy and\nhow we actually apply them, and\n\n60\n00:03:32.784 --> 00:03:38.240\nwhere to apply the as well as getting\neverything set up for what we need to do.\n\n61\n00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.650\nWe'll also see in the fourth part.\n\n62\n00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.760\nWe'll see services covered storage\nas well as NTFS permissions.\n\n63\n00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.054\nOne of the big topics that you'll see that\nwill be throughout everything that you'll\n\n64\n00:03:49.054 --> 00:03:52.108\ndo in your MCSA or MCSE track\nas you continue to move forward.\n\n65\n00:03:52.108 --> 00:03:54.606\nSo make sure you do take a look at those,\nas well.\n\n66\n00:03:54.606 --> 00:03:57.414\nAnd then finally, our last section,\n\n67\n00:03:57.414 --> 00:04:02.590\nwe'll be covering file services\nas well as print services.\n\n68\n00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.063\nNow once you actually have that and\neverything is good, that will give\n\n69\n00:04:08.063 --> 00:04:13.905\nyou a solid foundation for, of course,\nyou to proceed on to well deeper and\n\n70\n00:04:13.905 --> 00:04:18.670\nmore advanced topics that you'll\nsee inside MCSA and MCSE.\n\n71\n00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.950\nSo, this will give you at least a broad\nbreadth of knowledge to help you do so.\n\n72\n00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.889\nNow for you to obtain Brian's e-book,\nyou can go out there and\n\n73\n00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.462\nsearch on the internet.\n\n74\n00:04:29.462 --> 00:04:36.538\nUse your favorite browser engine, type in\nBrian Sviderol's name, S-V-I-D-E-R-O-L.\n\n75\n00:04:36.538 --> 00:04:40.634\nI know it's kind of a long name to spell\nout there, but you can actually type in\n\n76\n00:04:40.634 --> 00:04:45.370\nWindows Server 101 and you'll probably\nsee that there'll be a link there.\n\n77\n00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.236\nNow if you're actually an ITProTV member\nthough, you'll also see a link directly to\n\n78\n00:04:50.236 --> 00:04:54.831\nthis particular overview video as well and\nthat will also give you that access and\n\n79\n00:04:54.831 --> 00:04:57.618\nthat chance to be able to\ndownload that book too.\n\n80\n00:04:57.618 --> 00:04:59.982\nNow, this is not a light book.\n\n81\n00:04:59.982 --> 00:05:07.300\nSo even as an overview, it is,\nelectronically about 353 pages.\n\n82\n00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.890\nSo, you plus or minus about 50 pages for\n\n83\n00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.160\ntable of contents and\nthen some indexing at the end.\n\n84\n00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.250\nBut overall though,\nit's still about 300 pages.\n\n85\n00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.989\nSo, it is a great book.\n\n86\n00:05:17.989 --> 00:05:20.220\nIt's a great base of knowledge.\n\n87\n00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.423\nCombine that along with your own study\nskills, along with the labs that you can\n\n88\n00:05:24.423 --> 00:05:28.768\nactually follow in Brian's book as well\nas labs that we present here at ITProTV.\n\n89\n00:05:28.768 --> 00:05:33.467\nIt will get you prepared for\nwhat you need in Windows Server knowledge.\n\n90\n00:05:33.467 --> 00:05:36.643\nSo if you're ready to proceed,\nmake sure you stay tuned for\n\n91\n00:05:36.643 --> 00:05:38.940\nthe first video following this overview.\n\n",
